KENT. Ohio - Charles 
Spingola, a traveling 
preacher, said he began

25 cents ror each questi on

answer after he was accused 
of promoting violence and 
hate speech on campus. He 
sat in silence while a gather-

He only answered when 
they passed him change. Six

individuals can not sell 
things while on university

would depend on if what he 
was selling had any value.

Hackers Target E-Mail Accounts 
COMPUTERS: ACS 
c h a n ged pas~words 
a nd in c reased secu ri ty 

By Annette de 18 Llana 
Guardian Reporter 

Academic Computing 
Services (ACS) recently 
learned that a number of com-
puter systems at UCSD were 
targets by hackers last spring 
and over the summer. Rick 
Accurso, manager of user 
instructional services, said 
ACS has c\iscovered dozens of 
student e-mail accounts that 
were hroken into. 

Accurso said hackers used a 
program designed to guess 
passwords based on a person's 
name, words in a dictionary 
and substitutes of numbers and 
letters that look alike. 

"To try to keep the prohlem 
from getting worse, we ran the 
program ourselves," Accurso 
said . "We found dozens of 
accounts that had crackable 
passwords, but there was no 
way to know if the hacker had 
gotten into the account. We 
couldn' t send an e-mail to tell 
students the problem because 
we wouldn't know if we were 
really leaching them or if we 
were talking to the hacker." 

The only option, Accurso 
said , was to close the accounts 
of students that had crackable 
pas words. When they tried to 
log on, they were not able to 
access their e-mail accounts. 
These students then had to call 
ACS to reactivate the account 
and get a new pas word. 

ACS has issued modified 
guidelines for tudents creating 

new passwords. It now 
demands that passwords he 
complex, usi ng a mixture of 
upper and lowercase charac-
ters, punctuation and non-
alphabetic characters. 

'" wished they would have 
told us in advance," Revelle 
junior Scott Ellis said. "But I 
understand exactly why they 
did it and I agree, because a lot 
of people 's passwords arc real-
ly easy to guess." 

The password-guessing pro-
gram is widely distributed to 
the public and is usually used 
by companies to test the vulm:r-
ability of their programs, 
Accurso said. 

"It's the kind of thiog that 
can have a legitimate service 
when system administrators 
would try to use them to see if

LGBIA Holds 
Coming Out 
Day Event 
CELEBRATION: UCSD 
community s how upport at 
Price Center on Thursday 

By Vincent Gragnanl 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Lesbian , Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender A 'sociation (LGBTA) celebrat-
ed National omi ng Out Day last Thursday 
afternoon in the Price enter. The ce lebra-
tion consisted of a seri es or impromptu 
speeches from people sharing thei r personal 
experiences and express ing their support ror 
the leshian, gay, bi sexual and transgender 
community. 

In her opening speech, LGBTA principal 
memher Kati e Lane said she feels the hour-
long event is an open, free and safe forum . 

" It 's a day of celebration. It 's a day that 
we set aside to look at what telling the truth 
means in our everyday lives," she said. "It 's 
a day of introspection." 

Daniel Roddick, a Marshall senior who 
spoke at the event, said he sees discrimina-
tion in his everyday life. 

"Our culture and our government and our 
society oppresses anyone who is not hetero-
sexual," Roddick said. 

As an example, Roddick cited a blood 
drive being held at the Price Center, which 
would not accept blood from a man who has 
had homosexual sex. 

Among the event's supporters were the 
Karibu Drummers, who entered the Price 
Center beating their drums. The Karibu 
Drummers are from The Karibu Center for 
Social Support and Education, an organiza-
tion devoted to providing HIV / AIDS edu-
cation and related support to people of 
color. 

John Guinn, Executive Director of the 
Karibu Center said that being in the closet i . 
not a pleasant experience. 

"The closet is a self-imposed prison 
where one i hut up in i\ence," he said.

PINION 
Padres Look Toward Downtown 
Support.for Proposition C drowns out 
opposing view , leaving voters uninformed 
By Sean Sabo 
Contributing Opinion Wri ter 

They may not he lying to us this time, hu t we 
aren't being told the whole story, whid l i ~ just as 
bad. 

When voters visit the ballot box on Nov. 3, 
they will be scrah.:hing thcir heads ovcr thc 
propositions. The one that will ring a bell is 
Proposition C, the proposal for a downtown 
major league baseball park. It is a litt Ie less 
familiar than we think, though. 

With the Padres, Cox Communications, the 
Greater San Diego Chamher of Commerce, Ace 
Parking and The San DieRIl Ullion -Tribulle back-
ing the proposition, we know all too much about 
the prosperity a new ballpark would bring 10 
America's Finest City. However. we know noth-
ing of the other half of the argument. 

Financial disclosures with the city revealed 
thai opponenls to Prop. C have been oUlspent by 
701l-1, reported the Unioll -Tribune (OCI. 7, 
1998). The meek voil.:e of Strike Three on 
Proposition C (S.T.O.P. C). a commillee opposed 
10 a new ballpark, has been drowned out by large 
companies wilh apparent interests in downtown 
redevelopment. They are using their money and 
their conOCl.:tions like megaphones so thai Ihe 
public hears nOlhing of the opposition. 

It's like a David and Golialh story, eXl.:ept 
Goliath will win this one. With voices like Ihe 
fonner President of Qualcomm Harvey White 

and former United States Senate candidate 
Darrellissa, the movement fo r a new ballpark b 
a giant compar..:d to the opposi tion, ST.O.P, , 

ox Communications ha.~ donated ai rtimc to 
the cause - an OCI. 7, 1998 Union-Trihune art ide 
reported close to $13,000 in hroadca.~t advertising. 
In comparison, a driver might sec the occasional "A 
New Stadium'! Thanks. Already Got One" humper 
sticker. Or maybe a sticker advocating a new lihrary 
over a new hallpark. But lhat is it. 

Thc vote r~ are being cheated out of hearing 
both sides of Proposition C because of money 
and special inte rest~. 

The San DieKo UI/iol/ -Trihune has even 
jumped on the praise Proposition C hand wagon , 
The paper has run an occasionalleHer 10 the edi -
tor questioning the necessi ly of a new hallpark, 
hut always alongside a lener praisi ng thc propo-
sition and spelling out the good fortune it wi II 
hring 10 San Diego. 

Of the hundreds of articles our city's only 
major newspaper has run on the subjcct, onl y a 
handful have touched on the negative ell'ccts of a 
ballpark. Editorials and opinion pieces havc paint-
ed a new stadium in a positive kannic light. 
Alongside a Sept. 19 front-page artide was a large 
photograph reading "Yes On C." NO! so subtly, the 
Union-Tribune has staled its stance on the issue. 

We are without an unbiased media from 
which to gel information on the proposition. If

Housing Services Teaches Life Lessons 
By crowding freshman in, Housing and Dining Seroices are seroing up real life 
By Lamar HUChn 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Freshmen crammed into 
UCSD's dormitories and residence 
halls already have reason to thank 
the school's administration. They 
have been taught the lirst and most 
imponant lesson of the year: Life 
isn' l fair. 

Like a mother, UCSD's Housing 
and Dining Services has done a 
good job of teaching students their 
lirst real life lesson, 

We can blame it all on the moti -
valion for atlirmative action, I f a 

diverse campus is desired, a crowd-
ed campus necessarily follows. 

No longer can schools rcqui re 
information on ethnicilY when con-
sidering applicants. So, the only 
alternative is to increase the popu-
larity of the school, hoping for a 
wider variety of applications. 

or course, t hat provides for 
more students - 550 more stu-
dents than at this timc last year also 
provides for residence halls at 104 
percent capacity. UCLA's are at 
120 percent capacity, so there's the 
bright side. 

We are making strides towards a 
more diverse campus and a beller 
educational cnvironment. SiHing, 
early in the morning, wrapped in a 
towel and waiting for the shower is 
a good time to revel in this thought. 

or course, saving money is 
always good. Now that the suites are 
shared by cight people, the rent is 
actually affordahle. Students' par-
ents will appreciate the savings, or 
the students themselves will appre-
ciate it while repaying student loans. 
Saving money is always good. 

Saving money is a valuable les-
son for when it comes time to move 
out. away from the school. Students 
will want to share a room with two 
olher guys in a three bedroom, one-
and-a-half bath condo housing 18 
students just to save a huck. So this 
year's housing situation is real life 
c)(perience, 

This is learning to live with a 
roomie who always cats the 
Twinkies he didn't buy, This is learn-
ing that one person will be the only 
person ever to do the dishes, or 
learning that the dishes are always 
dirty. This is learning ahout one's 
own sleeping habits - along with 

everyone else's. Learn that it is 
hard to go to sleep when 

everyone else is 
awake and that it is 
too easy to wake up 
when everyone else 

docs, 

JOSeph,ne RQberls/Guar<1lan 

Yes, this is learning to live with 
other people. Except, this year there 
is one more person to steal the 
Twinkies and one more person to 
dirty dishes. It is one more room-
mate to stay up one hour later and 
cause everyone else to lose one more 
hour of sleep or miss one more lec-
ture. One more person in the shower. 

It is common that one 's room-
mate becomes one's best friend , So 
now most frcshman have two. This 
is what everyone is looking to do 
when going off to college: bci ng 
sociul and meeting people, The 
administration has just made it that 
much easier to meet people, 

Just as commonly, though, 
roommates are diametrically 
opposed oppos it es, waiting for 
each other to fall as lcep ~o that they 
can dig angry lingernails into ea<.:h 
other's cyes , Now, if then: arc

Americans Value 
More Than Money 
Editor: 

In Simone Santini 's arti cle, 
("American Values Rooted in the 
Dollar," Guardian, Oct. 8, I 991l ), 
Santini makes the claim that the 
only Ameri can value remain ing is 
money. I w mpletely reject th is 
notion. I claim that most 
Americans adhcre to va lues that arc 

not relatcd to money, specilically 
altruism, 

Santin i talkcd of how "i f any-
onc wa nts to kecp a joh, then that 
joh should ht: hi s or her one and 
onl y commitmcnt." That is si m-
pl y not the casc . Most employers 
arc will ing to permit family timc 
for employees, espec ially on the 
weekl) nds, If somc parti cular hoss 
is ex pec ting cmployees to sleep 
in their cuhicles, then find anoth -
er joh, Or cut a deal with the 
hoss . 

Ultimately, if someone cannot 
either rearrange their work schcd-
ule to make time for their family or 
he willing to make the efl'ort to find 
another job, the prohlcm is simply 
that he/she l: 3rCS mon: ahout the 
job than the famil y. 

What of sexual moralit y'l 
Santin i argucs that sex and morali -
ty have nothing in colilmon. In 
fac t. sexual conduct is oft en 
inr luded in the dcfinition of moral -
ity. (For example, sec definiti on 
number two in Wehster's New 
World Dictionary, 3rd College 
Edition,) 

Ignoring this, let us ponilcr the 
merits of free promiscuity and old-
fashioned chastity, According to 
the article , promiscuity is fun , 
healthy and doesn' t hun anyone. 
Now let us consider chastity. It 
helps prcvent unwanted pregnan-
cies and, hy that means, single-par-
ent households; it helps protect the 
practitioner from all STD's; and it 
makes it harder for women to be 
scen hy men as mcre scx ohjcct s. 

The entire Monica Lewinsky scan-
dal could have Ocen avoided if only 
the president had practi ced chastity. 
Is preventing all these things 
lIloral? 

Furthermorc, let the readcr a~k 
him/herse lf: Would you rather 
have a spouse that slept with any-
hody they wanted to anytime they 
felt like it , or would you rather 
ha ve one that would go through 
hell and high wilter to rcmain 
faithful to you alone'? Whidl of 
these two potential spoll ses would 
you regard as being more moral '? 

If Americans arc motivated 
merely by greed, then why is this 
not always seen? What about peo-
ple that return wallets full of 
money'! Or the ones who volunteer 
10 help in 'oup kitchens or donate 
financially to charity'l 

Is the college student who aims 
for a career as an elemcntary 
school teacher instead of a tcnured 
professor act i ng out of gr 'cd'! Or is 
it more likely to bc love for chil-
dren'! 

Most Americans still believe in 
altruism as a betler value than 
moncy. I grant that one would 
never know this from watching 
television, So turn it off and go 
look inside a church, where the 
concepts of ahsolute truth and 
morality are still preached, 

Look at the many college grads 
from UCSD who choose careers 
for reasons other than big pay-
checks. They're there whether you 
sec them or not.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

NEW LOAN RATES MISLEAD 
COMMENTARY: 
Higher Education Act 
prioritizes banks and 
economics over 
student and education 
Minnesota Daily IU. Mimesota} 

(U-W IRE) MINN EAPOLIS, 
Minn. - The 1998 re-authoriza-
tion of the Higher Education Act, 
originally signed into law in 1965, 
was a battle between banks and 
students. Although the bill passed 
unanimously in the Senate, eased 
its way through the House of 
Representatives and was praised 
by a pen-wielding President 
Clinton, the actual process 
involved two years of haggling. 

This haggling produced a 
watered-down, token gesture to stu-
dents and maintained the prolits of 
the banking system. Despite all the 
praise heaped on the bi II for its pos-
itive effects on students. hanks and 
the economy sti II possess a higher 
priori ty than students and educalion 
with the federal government. 

IntereSl rales on sludenl loans 
received intense scru tiny hy 
RepUblicans, DemocrJIs and loh-
byists on Capitol Hill. They decid-
ed to give students a meaningless 
decrease of 0.8 percentage points, 
from 11.2 to 7.4, arriving at the low-
est interest rate in 17 years . 
Students will save a Whopping 
$700 over 10 years under this 
scheme. The originally proposed 
bill reduced the interest nile to 6.8 

Despite all the 
praise heaped on 
the bill for Its 
positive effects on 
students, banks and 
the economy stili 
po ... ss a higher 
priority than 
students and 
education with the 
federal government. 

percent, but the banks were not 
willing to give up their hloated 
prolit margins. The act was also 
touted for increasing the maximum 
amount of money receivable from 
Pell grants, but thi s increase is illu-
sionary because rec ipients have 
never received the full amount. 

Under the two-prong interest 
rate program authorized by the bill, 
banks managed to retain their role 
as lenders to students and universi-
ties. despite early ell'orts to remove 
them from the educational -lending 
process entirely. The two prongs 
arc two methods of allocating 
money to students. the ti rst of 
which involves the banks, preserv-
ing their prolits. The sewnd incor-
porates the university as the lender. 

The guaranteed student loan 
program, the first prong, allows 
the government to set the interest 
rate, determine who ~an rc~eive 
the money and how mU l.:h each 

student gets. Banks provide the 
capita l and receive generous suh-
sidies from the government in 
return for their services. 

The direct loan program, the 
second prong, scales back govern-
ment involvement in the loan 
process. This new program allows 
universities to hand out loans with 
money provided from the govern-
ment , effectively cutting out the 
middle man . 

The linal winner of the battle 
hetween students and banks 
remains to be seen. Banks will 
continue to make huge protits off 
of government subsidies and 
interest rates for educational loans 
that are several percentage points 
ahove those for cars and mort-
gages. while students relish the 
minuscule decrease of rates and 
the token raising of the maximulll 
amount of money receivable under 
the Pell Grant. 

Congressional RepUblicans. 
Democrats and President Clinton 
all support an evolution toward a 
free-market system of allOl:ating 
loans, which would give banks 
nearly complete control of the 
process. The Higher Education Act

of their top-choice 
law schools.t 

Competition for law school is tough , and your LSAT score 
can make all the difference. That's why you need to take 
Kaplan. For 60 years , we've helped more students get 
into law school than all other test prep companies 
combined. That's why we're the #1 choice for LSAT prep.

we can no longer trust our newspa-
per to deliver all of the news, delet -
ing what it does not agree with and 
emphasizing an agenda it wishes to 
promote, where arc we left to look'! 

Even the San Diego Taxpayers 
Association has endorsed the bill, 
generating discussion about 
whether the association accurate ly 
represents San Diegans. 

The San Diego and Imperial 
counti es' AFL-CIO afli li ate council 
has publicly supported the proposi -
tion and the redevelopment of the 
26 square blocks of downtown San 
Diego. 

Usually a forum interested in 
probing and examining an issue for 
the truth, local radio station 
KOGO's Roger Hedgecock radio 
show, hosted by the former San 
Diego mayor, all but ignored the 
ballpark opposition. A series of 
shows endorsed the stadium dream 
by offering the AM waves to 
Padres' President Larry Lucchino. 

No mailer how many more hun-
dreds of voices we hear through 
expensive megaphones, we arc 
only hearing 50 percent of the 
story. We arc missing the other half 
of information about Proposition C 
needed to make an informed deci-
sion for San Diego. 

The Clairemont Town Council is 
the only other voice to express oppo-
si tion 10 a new hal lpark. However, an 
Oct. 3 Union-Tribune article tom:h-
ing on the council's disapproval said 
nothing of its reasoning. 

Monday, October I 2, 1998 

There are arguments against 
Proposition C. 

.Redevelopment of the 26 square 
block area of downtown near the 
embarcadero wou Id ex t i ngui sh 
areas of affordable housi ng in a city 
whose properly values and average 
rent have been on a steady incline. 
Small businesses which may rely 
on the cheap rent to keep thei r husi -
nesses alloat wi I( also be pushed 
out of their downtown habitat. 

City government makes lillie 
effort to hide the gargantuan cost 
of the project. Dollars that go 
toward the redevelopment will not 
be avai lable l'or other needed pro-
je~ ts, such as public works depart -
ments - water, elewicity, street 
maintenance. It would delinitely 
kiss a new centra l library good-bye. 

Arc we a city that promotes 
learning and community involve-
ment or that serves an elite few and 
a team of overpaid athletes who 
may not be around next year? 

There is no guarantee that a 
ballpark would anchor the Padres 
to San Diego. There is even less of 
a guarantee that Proposition C 
wou ld ensure that the Padres are a 
money-making business. 

With all of San Diego on the 
baseball bandwagon. we are sure to 
see much more advertising and 
advocating for Proposition C. We 
arc also sure to buy into it to sup-
port our winning team. 

Big names in San Diego arc 
using their money and their pull to 
drown out anyone who disagrees 
with them. Donations, private inter-
ests and media biases arc cheating 
San Diego voters out of the oppor-
tunity to make a well -informed 
vote this Novemher.

You arc the worst kind of person

When walking in the middle of 
a large crowd of people, you arc the 
kind of person who will come to a

hecause of Ihe had.ings. 

"Our primary business is sup-
pon instructional compuling. We 
support 25,000 accounls. The staff 
involved in the front -line supporl is 
live full - l ime workers and six parl-
lime sludenl worker ' ," he said. " II 
kceps us very busy : selling up 
accounts, password changcs, 
Ihere 's always Ihings lhal you 
wou ld like lo do thaI you don ' l 
havc lime for. There's been a big 
loss of lime here. It 's like losing an 
employee for lhree or four weeks. 
You never gellhe lime back." 

Accurso said Ihal nobody really 
knows who the current hackers arc. 
BUl , he said lhal UCSD sludents 
who have been caughl hacking are 
handed over lo Iheir dean and pun-

~EWS 9, 

ished according to Ihe severity of 
the offense. 

"There have been some cases 
where sludents ha ve been suspend-
ed or dismissed," Chips Dreilingcr, 
dean of Muir College, said. "The 
universily Iries 10 Ireal students as 
adults and we wanl lhem 10 think 
ahoul Ihe consequences of lheir 
aClions." 

Ellis s,lid Ihal he Ihinks hackers 
try to access unaulhorizcd systems 
because Ihey want 10 show off lheir 
lechnical prowess. 

"11 's like a Ihrill for some peo-
ple," he said. " It 's nOI monetary or 
anything. People jusl want to 
broadcast 10 everyone thaI they can 
do il." 

Accurso also said he believes lhat 
hackers are lrying 10 impress others. 

"People arc Irying 10 get pres-
lige wilhin lheir group of friends. 
They're Irying to impress Ihem and 
don't care about the consequences 
for somebody else," he said. '" 
undersland why they do iI, bUI I 
don't like il." 

Accurso said he advises stu-
dents to have difficulJ and complex 
passwords, not to give out their 
passwords and not 10 use Ihe same 
password for di fferenl purposes. 
He said he hopes Ihallhe new pass-
word formal will prolect student 
accounls because il makes il very 
di fficuh for password-gueSsing 
programs to crack them. 

'" hope Ihings won'l be as bad 
nexI summer. But hacking is not a 
new phenomenon," he said. ' \l 's 
been happening nalionwide, not 
jusl UCSD." 

"People's compulers are gelling 
more powerful over lime and il 
makes il Ihal much harder 10 
defend againsl Ihem," he added.

aspect that may be unknown to most orthe

change a life and tu achieve personal 
growth through the Vo lunteer Connection. 

The Volunteer Connection is an on-

Vo lunteer Conneclion has many diverse 
programs, from one-time events to year-
long mentorships. I nvolvement with the 
Volunteer Connection not only promotes 
L:Ommuni ty developmcnt , but also trans-
forms the volunteer. 

For somc, the mentally disabled arc a 
group of ind ividuals Ihal are usually 
viewed as incompetent and d ifferent. 
However, through the UCSD Best Buddies 
program, thcse stereotypes disintegra te 
and friendship · form between a volunteer 
and his or her Buddy, 

Through Best Buddies, university stu-
dents are malched wi th a student of the 
samc ag.: who is 11lI! ntally disabled, T h.:

des i re to be a good

" Buddies," Ihis year-

long program focuses on 
a~ tiviti es that Ihe university student would 
do with any other friend. The volunteer 
keeps in contact wi th the Buddy at least 
once a week, and panidpates in group 
aClivi ties twice a month. 

" It wasn' t the visits to the aquarium, the 
dates to the movies or trips to the bowling 
alley which Anh [her Buddy] enjoyed and 
appreciated most," said Andrea Canning, a 
College Buddy partic ipant l asl year. 
" Rather si mple interaction and easy con-

PSYCHO THERAPY 
Beware of all men named Sven who try to cut your hair 

MARY HIGGINS 
Senior Sfu.!l Writer 

Atlenti on , please. I want to 
make an annoum;emenl. Our over-
zealou s Assoc iate Sports Editor 
Travis "The Coach" Hill is going to 
have an embolism if you people 
don 't stan going to more game '. 
His witty, yet hostile column in 
Thursday's paper was ... well ... a 
little scary. I'm begg ing you. 
please, put on your Triton blue and 
attend some so rt of sporting event 
this week. For Coach's sake. 

I'll tell you something else that 
scares me - Oldsmobile is now 
making minivans with built -in 
VCR 's. I am not kidding. Now you 
can watch "Titanic" while you 
commute. 

I'll oct some 16-year-old teeny-
bopper runs me off Ihe road within 
II month . 

"Oooohh, I didn 't sec you!" she 
will exclaim. '" was right in the 
middle of watching Leonardo do 
his love scene." 

As i I' Californians aren' t already 
inept behind the wheel! As i I' peo-
ple aren't already doing stupid 
things when they drive, like talking 
on their car phones or eating four-

course meals. I have one friend 
who used to blow-dry his hair by 
sticking hi s head out the window. 

It 's enough to give me night -
mares. 

Well, 'tis the season to he fright-
ened with Halloween just a few 
weeks away. I' m definitely gelling 
into the spirit of things, even 
though trick-or-treating is just a lit -
lie 100 scary in my ghello neigh-
borhood ("Forget the candy and 
gimmc your wallet, IIIWJW *&!@"). 
I'll he carving a jack 0' lantern, 
brewing up some punch and you 

trim. I walked into a certain La 
Jolla sa lon and made an llppoinl-
menl. No problem. It 's not as if I'm 
some paranoid freak who breah 
into tears when the hair dresser cut s 
ofl a hillionth of an inch. I fel! pret-
ty relaxed as I waited in the lobhy 
for my turn. 

I waited and waited and waited. 
I soon learned that this was part of 
Svcn 's master plan to undermine 
my confidence. After the minule 
hand ti cked a quarter of the way 
around my Walch, Ile finally 
approached. 

Svcn 's gaze lingered for a 
moment and' held my breath, hop-
ing he would find me worthy. 
Finally, he turried on hi s hee l ,md 
led me to his stati on. 

Swn scaled me at the chair, 
wruppcd one of those cape-things 
around my neck and the Inquisition 
began. 

Sven: What would you like mc 
do tn you'! 

Mary: (gazi ng ner vously at 
razor-sharp shears) Just trim an 
inch off the hOllom, but ahsolutely 
no more. 

Til tell you something else that scares me - Oldsmo-
bile is now making minivans with built-in VCR !s. I 
am not kidding_ Now you can watch (Titanic ' while 
you commute, Til bet some 16-year-old teeny-hopper 

runs me off the road within a month, 
can be sure I'll wear a costume. 
This year I'm going as a hairstylist 
- there's nothing more frightening 
than thaI. 

I'm inspired by the guy whn cut 
my hair last week - wc' lI call him 
Sven . Let me tell you, Freddy 
Krueger 's razor fingers arc nothing 
compared to an irate hairstylist 
with a pair of scissors. I'Ill aboul to 
tell you a story that will forever 
change the way you feel ahout 
grooming. 

I! all started with an innocent 

Sven said nothing at \irs!. He 
just gave me a once-over, his eyes 
narrowing as he glanced at my hair. 
Now I'm the lirst to admit that my 
hair isn' t exa<.:t ly an objet d 'al1 (it 
looks windblown , hut only as 
though I've been standing in a tor-
nado). The look Sven gave me was 
downright rude . 

"You were struck hy lightening. 
maybe'!" he suggested, stroking his 
guatee. 

"No, my hair always looks like 
this." I told him. "I'm sorry." 

S ven: I'll take off three inches. 
Mary: (meekly) That will be 

line. . 
Next he washed my hair. I don ' t 

know if you've ever had someone 
wash your hair, but it can he a very 
sensual experience. 

Or it can be lerrifying. 
Sven: (kneading my scalp like 

lump of dough) What kind of 
shampoo do you usc '! 

Mary: Um, Flex. No wait, Pan-
tene. 

Sven: (snorts disapprovingly) 

The UCSD Career Services Center presents the 20th Annual 

I' ll show you some real shampoo. 
He he ld my head under the 

fau cet, slowly cranking up the tem-
perature until I agreed to buy $60 
wonh of salon-approved shampoo. 
conditioner, mousse, gel and 
spritzer. Momentarily placated. he 
cased a comb through my hair, very 
careful not to yank at the knots. 

Sven: ' can see your hair is very 
damaged. 

Mary: Well , I swim in the pool 
almost every day. 

Yank . 
Sven: Do you wear a cap'! 
Mary: Yes. Well , nO! always. 
Yank, yank. 
Sven: No more swimming for 

you. 
Mary : All right. 
At this point , the hairstylist had 

picked up the sharpest pair of s<.:is-
sors I'd ever seen so I was willing 
to agree to anything. I would have 
let him shave my head. if it had 
guaranteed my safety. 

"Sit up straight ," he ordered. 
"Stop trembling. , wouldn't wanttu 
accidentally <.:ut you." 

My hair fell to the floor in 
chunks. The shiny. silver blades 
snipped perilously \:lose to my 
jugular. A thin bead of sweat 
dripped down the side of my face . 

"Tell me about yourse l f," he 
commanded.

OPillioll h'ditor 

There comes a time when a per-
son can no longer run from the past 
or fear the past. onfronting its 
beastly image may be the only way 
to sleep through the night. Bear 
with me as I hring back the demons 
of my freshman year, 1995 C.E. 

The horrors of that year came 
hack to visi t me this past Wedne~­
day when I was hu~tling to class, 
which happens to be at the end of 
the Ea rth , York Hall. While tryi ng 
to pull myself together, I overheard 
a few freshmen complai ning about 
having to share a "closet-sized" 
dorm room wi th two other fresh-
men. 

They whined about having 10 
purchase a meal plan and of having 
to use it to buy "Spackle." One of 
the little twits was griping ahout 
not heing able to surf h cause EI 
Nino had screwed up the tides. The 
other moaned ahout not being ab le 
to lind "shaded" parking for her 
new Mercedes.

having to triple up, linding a park-

The other fourth-year student~ 
wi II hack me up. Meteorologisb 
ca lled that year La Puta Fria. For 
the lirst time in San Diego history, 
it hailed everyday for two weeks. 
Students u,ed their Chem 6A 
hooks 10 shield themselves from 
haseba ll-sized ch unks of icc. It was 
catastrophic. 

Thirty-two students and live 
professors wen: pummeled to 
death, not to mention the many stu-
dents who lost lingers and limhs 
due to frosthit e. While running to 
class like II faithful platoon, Math 
20A studems would drug their 
wounded comrades to class and 
prop them up in the fronl row. 

There were no outdoor sport s: It 
was just too dangerous. That 's why 
Ihere arc so many pre-med students 
today. We needed them to take l:are 
of the sick and wounded.

makes a phenomenal difference in 
the lives of these individuals to 
know that they can have a person to

While this exchange may posi-

their own translormation as we ll.

The Best Buddies Program 
Director, Ann-Marie Christian. said 
it is a unique opportunity to develop 
a relationshi p that mo~t individuals

"The program is uniquc hecause

said. "Many people have stereo-

BOOK REVIEW NICK RUNC O 
Senior Stall Writer The challenge of a campaign is addressed 

The newe 'l novel by Richard 
Norlh Patterson ex plores the 
intrigue of a polilil:al campaign, 
the romanli l: scandal thaI en ues 
and the rellllionship of politi l: ians 
to Ihe abortion debate, 

No Safl! Place tells the MOry of 
Senator Kiicannon, an ambitious 
young lawyer. He is haunted by 
the past of hi s brother, who was 
killed on the campaign trail to 
presidency. Kilcannon, who has 
now embarked on a campaign of 
hi s own, is doing his best to over-
I:ome the trauma of brother's 
assassination. In addition to the 
problems he must face with his 
brothers death, he is also dodging 
the scandal and intrigue that sur-
rounds any politica l candidate. 

Mixed into the story of one 
man 's quest for public office is a 
romantic twist, where the senator 
is involved with one of the 
reporters in the pool fo llows him 
on the campaign trail. The secrecy 
that surrounds this affair adds an 
intriguing twist to the whole story. 

All right , so besides the · fact 

All right, so besides 
the fact that this 
story Isn't a cere-

does have some 
very redeeming 
qualities. It aggres-

tion rights In the

ally, the suspense

that thi s story isn ' t a cerebral chal-

rig ht ~ in the face of difti cult ques-
ti on~. Additi onally, the suspense is 
a we lcome break from the litera ry 
chall enge of O-chem reading. 

Kilcannon's issues with abor-
ti on adds a lotto Ihe story. Person-
ally, ii's the reason why I lirsl 
picked up the book. The issues he 
has with hi s girlfriend, who 
decides to have an ahortion when 
she and Kil cannon cannot he 
togel her due 10 their re~pective 
careers, is interesting. He is torn as 
a candidate who bel ieves in free-
uom or choil:e, and as a man who 
hates to see this choi ce made. 

According to his book jacket, 
Pallcrson actually traveled on the 
1996 campaign to observe the 
inner workings of a candidate and 
his campaign . 

This realistic portrayal of a 
re'II-life campaign is educational 
in itself. Although the protagoni st 
is portrayed in a positive li ght. the 
story gives a fair portrayal of what 
it takes to put on a campaign .

Triton have a two-
win weekend

whistle to the final shrill. It was 
impressive. Armstrong 's boys 
were obviously out there to win, 
but they were also out there to 
regain some of the pride they ~o 
desperately needed to get back. 

The Tritons opened the scoring 
with a goal hy junior David 
Schilling, who scored on his lirst 
touch of the game. 

Then UCSD reversed a trend 
that had been haunting it for quite 
some time: it did not give up a 
goal in the waning minutes of the 
first half. 

This time, the Tritons delivered 
it. Just under a minute before the 
half, Doug McBride put the 
Tritons up 2-0. 

In the second half, the Tritons 
kept putting the pressure on 
Haverford. But in the 75th minute, 
Haverford caught a break and con-
verted on a penalty ki ck. 

This put an entirely new spin 
on the match, as Haverford began 
to smlmble haphaz.ardly lor the 
equalizer. 

But as had heen the case aJ.l 
nigh t, Haverford was teetering on 

W SOCCER: 
Thrilling overtime 
goal beats Cal Lu 
Continued from .... 28 
the ga me went to halftime knolled 
up at I- I. When the second half 
began, Dostalek took the team on 
her shou Iders and wi lied t hem to 
victory. 

After a couple of her runs had 
been stopped just short, she linally 
broke through in the 78th minute 
when a Cal Lu defender mis -
played a ball and let it s lip by. That 
was all Dostalek needed. She did 
not disappoint as she outraced two 
girls, cu back and rifled a shot 
into the net for a 2-1 lead. It was 
an amazing display of speed and 
skill . Even the Cal Lu players 
seemed stunned. Almost immedi-
ately after the restart , Dostalek 
again mced down the sideline and 
just barley missed another scoring 
chance. 

UCSD now had the game in 

the edge of disaster. It played four 
defenders nat In the back and 
pushed them up, meaning it 
always had a good chance of 
drawing UCSD offside. 

It also meant that if UCSD was 
onside, it was a breakaway. Such 
was the case late in the game when 
Tyler Thompson put the game out 
of reach after a couple of nice 
passes from Cameron Adams and 
Brady Bernard. 

But the Tritons had to put the 
exdamation point on their day. 
With just a few minutes to go, 
Bernard sent a cross into the 
Haverford 18-yard box and Adams 
sent it into the back of the net with 
a vicious header. 

On Sunday night, RIMAC was 
rocking as hundreds of fans turned 
out for the UCSD soccer double-
header. 

After the Triton women's team 
did every UCSD fan a great favor 
by knocking off the hated Cal Lu 
Regals 3-2 in overtime, the men 
took the lield and continued to 
thrill the UCSD fans wi th a solid 
victory of their own. 

The Tritons carne out playing 
very intense ~occer once agai n. 
They were putting pressure on 
every Stevens Tech hall. The 
intensity paid off for UCSD earl y 
as the Duck defense crumhled 

their favor, and began to play more 
defensively. It seemed as if the 
Tritons had the game put away, hut 
Cal Lu would not die. 

In the 85th minute, the Regals 
answered. Moving laterally along 
the 18-yard box, Rasmussen lofted 
a left -footed chip shot, which 
grazed hoth the crossbar and the 
outstretched hands of Hetland as it 
went into the net. 

II was now UCSD's tum 10 be 
stunned, but it didn 't stay rallIed 
for very long. The team went hack 
on the offensive, keeping the ball 
in Cal Lu terri tory for mnst of the 
final minutes. 

As time was ticking down, 
UCSD had the hall uncomfortably 
close to the net many times. It just 
could not linish. Dostalek still had 
one last chance to score the game 
winner in regulation. With just 30 
seconds left she received a good 
cross from Hughes, but her shot 
sai led just over the crossbar. 

The large crowd let loose a col-
lective groan and the game went

under tbe Triton pressure. 
The goal wasn't pretty, as the 

Duck goalkeeper misplayed it and 
one of the defenders tried to catch 
the ball as it crossed the line. 

But after all was said and done, 
there was no penalty kick for the 
catch and when the dust sell led, 
Sean Salinas was given credit for 
the goal. 

But the rea l credit went to the 
tremendous pressure the Tritons 
put on the Ducks early as the 
UCSD fans hollered suppon. 

Then the Tritons did it again. 
Just before halftime, UCSD fans 
were worried about the inevitahle 
breakdown. It happened. but it 
happened to the Ducks as 
McBride got a breakaway and 
stormed the nel. He then fed a 
great hall across 10 Anthony 
Funicello in the middle and he put 
it away. 

The Tritons were starting to 
ga in their confidence hack. As the 
second half began it was evident 
that they were pl aying ~ome of the 
same strong soccer as they had 
earlier in th \! s\!ason. The secomJ 
half was a struggle, as th\! Ducks 
would not fold . 

The Ducks had their moments, 
and bcc:luse of so me terrible offi-
ciating, the Ducks cut the Triton 
lead in half. A through hall to an

Junior Defender 

on into overtime. It was sudden 
death in a game that had the whole 
season riding on it. In the e)(tra 
period, both teams played cau-
tiously. But when Dostalek turned 
the corner like she had been doing 
all game, you knew they it . was 
over. 

"To win that way in sudden 
death was big time" Coach Brian 
McManus said "We've heen prac-
ticing that a lot, allacking the near 
post. Everybody knew their jobs 

obviously offside Duck was ruled 
on, and the Ducks finished the 
opportunity. 

For a few moments , things 
began to look bleak for UCSD as 
fifth-year senior sweeper John 
Brandon, who had been playing 
wonderfully, made a hard tackle 
and got a mild concussion. He had 
to be substituted OUI. 

Goaltender Lucas Curtolo was 
also kicked in the head, but stayed 
in the game. 

With the defense hurting, the 
olTense picked up the s lack for the 
rest of the way as UCSD pu t 
tremendous pressure on the Duck 
net. 

It was evidenced by UCSD's 
final goal as Bernard got a break-
away, hut missed near post. 

The subsequent goal kick was 
not cleared, and the nex t Triton 
assault had similar results as 
Funicello got a breakaway. His 
shot went 011' the poSI. Josh Figgs 
got the ricochet and gave it to 
Salinas, who easily finished the 
play and th\! match. 

It was a so lid weekend fo r the 
Tri tons, who must play in their 
curren t form if they hope to make 
the post~eason . 

"All we can do now is win, 
then hope," Armstrong ·said . "But 
first , we must win ." 

and it paid off with a win" 
The star of the game was as 

ohvious to the cOlH.:h as it was to 
the fans. 

"Cindy was the difference 
today" McManus said. 

Defender Harispe knows thi s 
game meant a lot 10 her team. 

" It gives us a lot of confidence 
for the postseason," she said , "W~ 
arc looking forward to the future 
now. This proves we can be suc-
cessfuL" 

The Tritons now have a pretty 
good chance of making it to 
regionals, but all is not guaran-
teed. They still need to win their 
two remaining Division 1II garnes, 
including the last game of the sea-
son at Chapman. 

McManus expressed optimism 
at his teams chances. 

''I'm very impressed by this 
team right now. When they believe 
in themselves, there 's nothing they 
can't achieve:' McManus said. 

The Tritons play CSU San 
Bernadino at home on Wednesday.

Cone to balk. Instead, Cone just 
barely resisted the urge to throw to 
third and continued with the pitch. 
With all the distraction however, 
you couldn 't even really call it a 
pitch. It was more like a lob. Cone 
just pushed it toward the plate and 
Manny Ramirez. blasted it 500 
feel. 

Unfortunately for the Indians 
(and luckily lor the Yankees), it 
was 500 feet foul. Take nothing 
away from Omar, his greasy tactil:s 
almost worked. He tried hi s best to 
help the ev il Indians win. I'd just 
wish he 'd give up already. 

In last night's Game Five, Omar 
stepped into a pitch. He took a 
David Wells fas tball right ofT hi 
hands without a whimper. He just 
shook it off and took his on pla\:c 
on lirs!. In game four, Visquel stole 
third base and Yankee third base-
man SCOII Bros ius didn ' t even 
cover the bag. Omar cast hjs magic 
'pell and everyone forgot about 
him. 

When you lo rget ahout Omar. 
bad things happen. He turns the 
double playas well as anyone, but 
never makes it look fancy. Indians 
manager Mike Hargrove called 
him "the greatest shonstop he 's 
ever seen." 

He just docs hi s job, and he's 
always the first out of the dugout 
to congratulate his teammates. The 
guy 's everywhere. I hate him. 

After the Yankees swept the 
Rangers in the Division series and 
won game one by 5 runs, I foresaw 
the ALCS as merely another sma ll 
hurtle toward the Championship. 
Then came the second game. Evil. 
evi l game two. 

In the 12th, Yankee second 
baseman Chuck Knoblauch made 
one of the worst plays I've ever 
seen. You saw the highlights on 
ES PN . Knobs just stood there 
arguing near first base, as the ball 
rolled into the outtield and Enrique 
Wilson scored the winning run. 
Talk aboul no hustle! What was 
Chuck thinking? That honeheaded 
play cost the Yankees the game, 
and may yet cost the Yankees a 
chance at the World Series. A men-
tal error by an infielder, huh? If 
only we had Omar.

SNEAKERS: Tritons race against Irvine and time as last warm-up before Triton lnvitational meet 
By Saul SherIdan 
Staff Writer 

For every team or athlete trying 
to achieve a goal, the toughest 
opponent to face in a season is not 
an arch rival. 

It is not some blind 
referee who 
is deciding 
the fate of the 
game with a 
coin toss and it is not that 
tender ankle injury that 
throbs with every step. 

The most relentless adversary 
of all is time. 

Time can only be lost, it can 
never be gained. In cross country, 
each team member nOl only ra(;es 
against the other runners but 
against the clock. 

Time can be a runner 's worst 
enemy or hest friend . The Tritons 
are racing against this enemy now, 
not only in their races, but in the 
coming weeks. 

For the Triton cros~ country 
squad, time is running out for it 10 
get to the postseason. 

Only three weeks lin: left in the 
season for the team to earn an invi -
tation to Carlisle, Pa. which wi ll 
be the site of this year's NCAA 
Division III Championships. This 
is not the time to wimp out or give 
up. 

This weekend , the Tritons 
played host at a dual meet against 
UC Irvine. 

The meet served as a warm-up 
for next weekend 's all-important

Triton Invitational. Focusing more 
on team strategy than on individ-
ual results, the team gutted out a 
lOugh performance. 

When it was over, the Tritons 
came away with a split vic-

tory again t the Division I 
Anteaters. 

" I think 
the whole 
team is happy 

with the way we p\!r-
formed," sophomore 

Kristen Carter said . "Everyone ran 
really well." 

The Triton men were led by an 
outstandi ng performance from 
senior Josh Levin-Soler. 

After battling in third place for 
most of the race, Levin-Soler di s-
played both great ski II anti tough-
ness as he took the lead late to win 
the race for the Tritons with a time 
of 26:32 

Not far behind him were Steve 
Sorenscn and Jason Stone, who 
linished lifth and sixth in the race 
respectively. 

"Thc whole team gave a great 
effort : 10 do thi s well against a 
team like Irvine is tremendous," 
Stone said. "Josh ran really we ll 
fo r us." 

Another strong performance 
came from senior Jason 
Wi skerchen. Wi skerchen ran a 
personal hest time of 28: 16 to fin -
ish seventh lo r the team. 

'This was a hreakthrough m\!et

coach I Ted Van Arstlale di scussed

On the women's side, junior 
Kristi O'Grady led the Triton 
women wi th a solid six th -plae\!

Not far behind her was team-
matc Kristen Carter, who fini shed 
the race in 11th pIace with a time 
01'21:28 . 

"I think we .were all impressed 
with the UC Irvine team, they 
were really g00d:' Carter said. 
"But I think everyone on the team 
was happy with the way we ran ." 

Th~ fact that UCSD had such a 
good showing against the Division 
I school shows how much depth 
th\! t\!alll has. 

Now the Tritons hav\! what 
may he the most impor:ant meet of 
the season coming up when they 
host the Triton Invitational here at 
UCSD next week\!lId. 

Hopes of qualifying for nation-
al s and earning an invitation to the 
conference finals hang in the bal -
ance. 

"Th\! next weekend is big," 
Stone said . "This weekend was all 
about testing the course. lindin£ 
the w~ak spots in th\! course, so 
w\! fcel ready nex t Saturday." 

Wiskerchen shared Ston;; 's 
sentiment 

"Hopefull y I will do rca l well 
for th\! team and cam a place for 
conference," Wisken;hen said. 

The Triton Inviational may he 
their last chance. 

For Van Arsdale\ troops, the 
time is now. Will they be up to the 
challenge') Thus far, the chal -

lengc~ for the Tritons havc yielded 
great result s. Hopefu ll y, thi s 
weekend wi ll bear more of the 

~allle . 

First-year middle blocker Kati e 
Vater also found her niche in thc 
Triton lineup I>y powering through 
a I:ouple kills of her own. 

" It was great for Vater to get her 
fcct wet tonight." McFarland said. 
"She was a lillie unsure at the begin-
ning of the season, but r think she is 
showing some confidence. She is 
sti ll holding back a hit, but is really 
finding her place on the team." 

Freshman outside hitter Laura 
Santerre also found some playing 
time, proving that she can play 
with the championship squad. 
Santcrre made her first appearance 
late in the final game, and blasted a 
hard, cross-court kill on her first 
touch of the match. 

'"It was so cool to see Laura 
Santerre come in and get a kill 
right away," Noonan said. " It just 
shows how deep we are. We are so 
deep it 's not even funny." 

These you ng and talented play-
ers will bc useful this weekend, as 
the Tritons play host at their annu-
al UC San Diego Invitational. 
They will race other toP-nolch 
Division III schools, including two 
teams from last year's NCAA 
Quarterfinals. 

"Our depth is going to help us 
out so much this weekend," 

oonan said. "We have four games 
in two days, and all or the teallls 
we' ll play are Christi an Heritage 
I:aliher or better. We will have such 
an advantage hecause all of us can 
play. Everyone on the team is so

the helm i, on a ro ll. He rel:ord-
cd his ]OOth carl:er vil: tory la~t

Invitational Tournament again,t the

nOI even 
\nillcd the poll. and for 

good reason. CSO jU!>1 
crushed the hapless Tigers, getting 
four goa ls each rrom Paul 
B les,man and Vladimir OjapiL 

But as the Tritons came back tn 
La Jolla for another long weekend, 
thi s time with a aturday match 
against Occidental College and a 
Sunday contest again t Santa Clara 
University, Harper was hoping hi s 
boys would not let down. 

How difficult is it to sh ut out an 
opponent'! UCSD is one of the top 

tea lll~ in the country every year and 
it hasn't pulled the trid si nce 
September 8. 1989. That was nine 
years and 29 1 games ago. It was a 
25-0 thrashing against none other 
than Occidental allege. 

Lisa Huff/ Guardian 
Fire Away: The Tritons used their dominating water polo skills and capitalized on Occidental 
College's inepititude in the pool and recorded the ir first shutout since they last blanked O.C . 1989 . 

As was ~hown by convincing 
victories over hoth schoo ls, there 
would be no hangover from the 
Santa ruz excursion. The Tr.ilOl)s 
absolutely obliterated the Tigers of 
Occ idental , 17-0. A ~ hUlOut in 
water polo is an unbelievably difli -
cu lt task. rhe Sunday hallie in the 
pool featured a more diflicult 
opponent in Santa lara. The 
Broncos gave the Tritons a run for 
their money in their last match . and 
the Triton~ were looking forward to 
the test. They easily passed. win-
ning 12-5. 

The Occident,1i game was a 

But coming into thi s weekend, 
everyone knew that the Occidental 
match really wa,n't the big game. 
The marquee matchup was defi -
nitely the return match between the 
Tritons and the Broncos. 

The last time UCSD raced Santa 
lara was last weekend in Santa 
ruL. The Broncos came out kick-

ing against CSD, but the Tritons 
managed to squeak out a 9·7 vit:to-
ry. The game was very tight. and 
the Tritons knew th.1I they would 
have a serious tcst yesterday. 

But don ' ttcllthat to junior R()~\ 
Mc.:chal11. I I' Mecham could play 
every game against Santa Clara, he 

would prohahly be regarded as one 
of the greatest water polo players 
who eve r li ved. 

Mecham scored 7 of UCS D's 9 
goa ls in Santa Cruz, and he led the 
Tritons on Su nday wi th another 3. 
For all of you math majors . Ihat's

From there, the Tritons cruised to

Super Subs Lift Tritons to Another Win 
SHOT DOWN: UCSD beats rival Christian Heritage Hawks in three game with lots of help from the freshmen off the bench 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

A lot can be ~aid of a team that 
plays mostly freshmcn. Does 
"inexperie l1l:ed" sound fa mi liar? 
How about "young'''! 

While "young" and 
" inexperi-

they always do, the reveali ng story 
of the night came from the likes of 
two fresh men: Jamie Woods and 
Kathlecn Hent z.. 

Woods and Hentz helped the 
Tritons eo me over the top 

and combined for 22 kills 

enced" m~IY IIr'Mllf4 iVOLLEYBALLI 
bc used lor 

and 3 scrv i ce 
aces. The duo 
also played 
defense and most tea ms 

with frcshman starters, 
these Iwo words do not apply 
to UCSD 's wO l1l en ' ~ volleyhall 
squad. 

Whcn Head Coac h Duncan 
McFarl and pu lied some of his more 
ex perienced ational 
Championship players in favor of 
playing hi s freshmen, he made a 
hig statemcnt to thc rcst of Di vision 
Ill; and il wasn' t Ihat hi s squad was 
"young" or "inex periel1l:ed." 

He was showing the rest uf the 
Western Regional compcti tion that 
the Triton squad has depth - a lot 
of it. 

When a team can si t some of its 
Nati onal Championship players. 
play its freshmen and still win in 
straight games, as the Tritons did 
on Friday night against Christian 
Heritage College. it is also fair to 
say the team is good . 

The Tritons are good. 
Last Friday, backed hy a large 

and enthusias ti c crowd, the Tri tons 
won their 14th game of the season 
as they downed Christian Heritage 
in Ihree garnes, 16- 14, 15-12, 15-5. 

Though the Triton veterans 
Shannon Noonan, Christine 
Kueneman, Katherine Brynjestad, 
Leslie Punelli and Jaime 
Hackleman played solid hall 
throughout the ent ire match, as 

scooped up Y digs . 
CSD led 14·K and almost 

had game one in the bag, but the 
Hawks would not relinquish the 
IInal point. After a pai r of net vio-
lations by the Tritons and a few key 
hlocks by the Hawks. Christian 
Heritage crawled back to within 
two points. 14- 12. 

That's when McFarland went to 
his bench and hrought in Woods. 
The rrcshman stepp(;d in liko.: a vct-
I!ran and [lut away a key sideout kill 
rollowed by her Ii rst or two service 
aces to lead UCSO to a game one 
Will . 

Woods continued to play , trang 
in the carly part s of game two, and 
powercd a kill through the hands of 
the Hawk hlockers. as the Tritons 
ro ll ed out to an early 6-0 lead . 
Woods ' better half, middleblocker 
Hentl.. was also in the Triton line-
up. Hent z kept the UCSD crowd 
going with three consecutive Triton 
kill s. 

Hentz' kill s were manifestations 
of the Triton's new plan of attack: 
to get the middle hlockers actively 
invol ved in the UCSD offense. 

Last wee k. McFarland was con-
cerned that the Triton allllck was 
too predict able, coming mostly 
from UCSO's powerful outside hit -
ters, like Allison Bender, Punelli

Take That: UCSD hammers home a spike in one of its many wins this season. The Tritons have 
rolled over many opponents thanks to a good blend of talented freshman and seasoned veterans. 

and Brynjestad. He said he thought 
that complicating his scheme and 
setting the middle blockers would 
lead to a stronger and less pre-
dictable offense. 

"Our opponents all know that 
we are strong from the outside, and 
thcy just sit on our hillers," 
McFarland said . " It really put a lot 
or pressure on them ." 

So the Tritons reworked their 
onc-sided attack, and added more 
l1avor 10 their offense. This change 

was evident in Friday 's game, a 
setters Dana Salter and Kueneman 
set UCSO 's middle blockers 
Noonan and Hentz. 

"We've been working a lot on 
setting Kathleen IHentzl to the out-
si de." McFarland said . "It was 
working really well for us 
[Friday\." 

Freshman Hentz was almost 
always on target, pUlling 12 of I R 
kill attempts 10 the 110 Jr. 

Hentz and Woods continued to 

share ki lis throughout the rest of 
game two. It was Woods, who 
served the Tritons to victory. 

Game three continued where 
game two left off. The Hent l.-
Woods duo l:ontinued to dazzle the 
UCSD crowd. trading off digs and 
kills , to an easy 15-5 win . In the 
Iinal gamc, another pair of fre 'h-
men also got their feet wet, and. in 
doing so proved jusl how deep this 
women's squad is.

Screw the Padres:

I hate Omar Visquel. 
He just stands there without

makes the plays he has to and 
never makes a mistake -
always a thorn in the side of the

God, I hate that guy.

games to two lead over the

in their race to play in the IY9tl 
World Series. Despite the fact 
that the Yankec's on ly need to 
win one of two hal:k in ew 
York, it never shou ld have been 
this dose. 

All thi s hype ahou t the 
Padres-thi s and Padre-that. You 

an Diego people don 't know 
what a truly successful team 
looks like. I we nt to the third

A).. a third-generati on Yankee 
fan. horn and raised in ew 
York 's hig suburb (otherwi se 
known as New Jersey), I've 
heen wa iting for the World 
Series all season long. In what is 
being hailed as the hest season 
in basehall history, the Yankees 
are a team of destiny. 

Roger Mari s's home run 
record may have fall en. but the 
Yankees hroke records of their 
own. They set the American 
league record for wins in a sea-
son with 114 and fell only one 
short of the major league record. 
To put it bluntly, THEY WON 
A LOT. 

Yet , what does the regular 
season mean for the Yankees 
right now'! Squat, Zilch, Zero. 
It 's a two-game season for the 
Bronx Bombers now. It should 
not even be in question . In my 
opinion, 114 wins should givc 
you an automatic hid to the 
Series. The Indians just don ' t 
deserve to win; they arc just not 
as good. But they just won ' t 
die!! 

It all comes hack to Omar, 
he's the problem. As the heart 
and soul of a team that came 
two outs away from winning the 
World Series last year. he docs 
all the lillie things that help a 
team win. If you hang on every 
pitch of a Yankee game like I do, 
you see those lillie things.

winding up. He almost got

Hustle: Defender Tyler Thompson fights to Win a ball. UCSD had 
a huge weekend beating both Haverford and Ste.vens Tech . 

After a win over Haverford on 
Saturday} UC D beat Steven 
Institute of Technology} 3-1 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

When you're on the bottom, 
there's nowhere to go but up. 
That's a great sayi ng, hu t si mply 
"going up" docs not describe the 
UCSD men's soccer squad after it 
hit rock bollom after its 
devastating 3-2 loss to 
rival Cal Lu. 

The Tritons 
responded with 
two impressive 
victories lasl weekend, a 
4- 1 Saturday win against 
Haverford College, a 
Pennsylvania school, and a 3- 1 
win last night against the Stevens 
Institute of Technology of New 
Jersey. 

UCSD is a team on the mend, . 
as hoth victories came against 
solid East Coast schools. 

After the heartbreaking defeat 
at the hands of one of their biggest 
rivals, the Tritons knew they had 
to rebound. 

Their season was basically 
hanging by a thread - if they lost 
again, all postseason hopes would 
be dashed. 

Not making the playoff ' is a 
decidedly unfamiliar position for 
UCSD, considering the fact that 
Head Coach Derek Armstrong ha . 
never experienced a losing season 
in his 16 years here. 

That wou ld be never. as in not 
once. UCSD has m:lde the post-
season in 13 of the last 14 seasons. 
After the Tritons fe ll to Cal Lu on 
Monday, they were 3-6- 1 and pre-
cariously close to being eliminat-
ed from the playoff hunt. 

But Armstrong took the 
rest of the week to 

regroup during 
practice and more 
importantly, heal 
hi s players. 
For the lirst time 

since the open'ing 
matches of the season, the Tritons 
would enter their weekend match-
es with all of their starters healthy. 

Ohviously, these were all fac -
tors in the Triton turnaround last 
weekend, but possibly the most 
important in the rebound was the 
players ' quest to rebuild thei r 
pride. 

UCSD is a program that prides 
itself on its tradition, its skill and 
its will to win . 

Last ~onday the Tritons did 
not have much of all three, but in 
the weekend's round of matches, 
the Tritons returned to their old 
form. 

In the Saturday bailie against a 
solid Haverford squad, UCSD 
stormed the tield and played 
intense soccer from the opening

udden death overtime 

By Jacob Gordon 
Sports Editor 

Sudden Death . The words per-
fectly describe last night's women 
socl:er match against California 
Lutheran. The Triton 's playoff 
hopes hung in the balance; 
j ust one mistake 
could have cost the 
team the game and 
just one great 
play could have 
won it. After 90 
minutes of hard work on 
hoth sides, one goal decided 
the match. 

When the UCSD women 's soc-
cer team played division rival 
California Lutheran on Sunday, it 
was more interested in great plays 
than mistakes. Five minutes into 
overtime, sophomore forward 
Cindy Dostalek made a brilliant 
run up the left side, turned the cor-
ner and tired a perfect pass to 
freshman forward Jessica 
Cordova, who volleyed into the 
back of the net. Game over. 
Tritons win 3-2 raising their 
record to 6-2- 1. 

This play was the perfect end-
ing to a game that had everything. 

The match was the biggest 
contest of the year against the 
Triton's biggest rival . The winner 
would be in the driver's seat to go 
to regionals. The loser would have 

a hard time making the playoffs at 
all. Everything was on the line in 
the Cal Lu game and the Tritons 
knew it. UCSD had not lost a 
Division III regular season game 
si nce Oct. 9, 1992. Who was the 
team that beat them'? The Cal Lu 

Regals. 
The game began as a 

back and forth 
battle with lots 
of physical play 
in the. midfield . 

Cal LugMonthe hoa~ 
first in the 39th minute via 

a corner ki ck. After the ensuing 
scramble, the ball popped out of 
the crowd to Regal forward 
Christina Rasmussen. She fired a 
shot through traffic , which 
ti pped off Triton goalkeeper 
Jennifer Hetland 's hands into the 
net. 

The Tritons were down 1-0, 
but they were not di scouraged. 
They kept playing aggressively 
and it paid off. Just two minutes 
later, Triton junior defender Janine 
Harispe won a ball in the penalty 
area, where she was taken down 
hard from behind. Freshman mid-
fielder Liz Hughes slotted the 
resulting penalty kick past the 
Regal goalkeeper. The Tritons had 
their equalizer. 

Both sides kept working, but
