UC student lobby

The housing problems of the U C S Dar e a and 
UCSD students could be insufficient community 
solved by forming a lobby to transportation to get

News Editor 
When a student audio-

visual technician found two 
video tape editing machines 
unchained in an open Third 
College Media Center room, 
he thought he would teach 
the communications depart· 
ment a lesson about security. 

The technician locked 
away the table·top editors for 
half a day on Oct. 6 and only 
revealed their whereabouts 
after campus police had 
begun interrogating the 
students and 'staff who had 
key access to the room during 
the time of the alleged 
break in. 

But according to Media 
Center director Dan 
Sullivan, the technician 
encountered a rather rare, 
although insignificant, 
breech in the center's 
security system. He has since 
been reprimanded for his 
actions. 

In this case, the two editing 
machines had just been 
placed in the rooms and had 
not been secured. Now they 
are tied down with plastic 
coated metal cable, as is all 
other equipment that is not 
otherwise bolted down. 

The security problem, 
Sullivan says, is minor 
considering the great number 
of students who use the 
center's facilitie on a 24· 
hour seven days a week basis. 

To use much of the center's 
sophisticated but amateur 
equipment, students mu t be 
enrolled in de ignated media 
courses a s well a be 
proficient in the u e of the 
equipment.

finish with the facilities. 
"In four years there have 

only been two things stolen," 
Sullivan says. He feelS it was 
"professionals" who broke in 
and took the two television 
monitors over a Christmas 
break several years ago. 

"Students act as their own 
security system," Sullivan 
says, noting that by the fifth 
week, most of the facilities 
are in use around the clock. 

"I don't know how to 
administrate human na· 
ture," he says. 

"It may not be utopia, but 
they (students) get what they 
need, although they may not 
get what they want." 

Sullivan explains that 
while some students who 
have dealt only with the 
school's media center feel 
restricted by security 
measures, most transfer 
students into the program 
"are amazed" at the liberal 
access to equipment. 

"You've got to tolerate 
what you have," says 
Sullivan. He sees a limited 
media center budget as 
another reason why security 
must maintain at its current 
level. 

With a ceiling budget of 

$157,233 this year, the center 
will just be able to continue 
offering the same ervices it 
has for the past four years.

Resist registration-refuse to 
be the pawn in an imperial game 

BY EDWARD WILLIAMS 
About 200 years sao a colonial people took on 

the most powerful empire of its day in a war of 
national liberation. The empire possesed vast 
armies. ThOU2h the colonials also fielded an 
army, they relied. upon the ~wer of the people 
organized as small guerrtlla units to wear 
down their enemy and finally defeat it. 

With such a tradition, why does the US, in 
the 20th century, find itself fighting against 
popular guerrilla movements demanding 
national liberation? Could it be that, like the 
British before us, we have become a world 
empire against which people struggle for their 
liberty? 

This is indeed the case, but we must look for 
the roots of this empire in something other 
than capitalism, in what Lenin called 
imperialism - the highest stage of capitalism. 
For it is clear that the Soviet Union is capable 
of imperialism in Eastern Europe and 

Af~hanistan, that communist Vietnam 
mamtians an imperial presence in Cambodia 
and Laos, and that the Peoples Republic of 
China imperially dominates inner Mongolia 
and hopes to exert such an influence over 
Southeast Asia. 

The source of both capitalist and socialist 
imperialism is the existence of the nation·state 
within the context of a world capitalist 
economy. A national economy, whether 
internally socialist or capitalist, must 
necessarily act as a competitive unit with 
respect to other national economies in the 
world economic arena. 

Of course there are internationalist trends 
- the American dominated multinational 
co!')lOrate system and the Soviet dominated 
COMECON - but these are expressions of 
empire, not of true international cooperation. 
In turn, competition tends to imperialism as 
few nations are totally self·sufficient in 
resources and technology, especially when 
attempting to industrialize. 

The need, then , to control internati<.nal 
markets is intrinsic to the nature of the nation· 
state. Therefore economic colonialism, backed 

by military intervention, can be expected of 
those nation· states capable of it. On a world 
scale this means the United States, the Soviet 
Union, and lately, the Peoples Republic of 
China. The systems defined between these 
centers of empire and their satellites overlay 
the basic division in the world capitalist 
economy. 

This division pits strong, core nation·states 
with highly industrialized national economies 
against weak peripheral nation·states with 
undeveloped resource·exporting national 
economies, bridged by nation·states in the 
process of industrializing, or those 
indus trialized but capable of world·scale 
military intervention. 

Now that the basis for imperialism in the 
nation·state and the world capitalist economy 
is understood, it is important to grasp that 
capitalism in the United S tates only 
aggrevates American imperialism. 

A brief glance at the government 's defense 
budget, which takes no account of those 
private industries involved in defense, is 
evidence enough for the key nature of this 
sector of the economy. An active defense 
industry means high employment, a slack 
defense industry means unemployment and 
discontent. Further, when the economy falters 
from factors other than the lack of a war, a war 
helps in promoting recovery. 

But even in the best of times, problems may 
arise. Young people may decide they don't 
want an affluent middle·class life as American 
youth did in the '60's. Workers may go beyond 
demands for economic concessions and take up 
the demand for workers ' control, as British 
workers did in the 60s. Heaven forbid that 
students and workers should ally and 
challenge the state, as students and workers 
did in France in '68. A war is convenient for 
venting off the rising pressures of discontent, 
and the call of patriotism has been used to 
sidetrack class and race conflicts.

Livin' 
in the 

city 
by marcia bris bois 

New York - Everyone hates to move. 
Climbing into neighborhood dumpsters to 
retrieve cardboard boxes, packing all of one's 
possessions into those boxes, and soliciting 
help from muscular friends can all be 
embarrassing, hectic, and, not suprisingly, 
depressing. But by the time the last container 
and the ultimate footstool have been wedged 
into the oddly· proportioned storage area (a 
mere 5' by 10' of floor space but 20' straight up), 
you are generally relieved to be without 
possessions and a place to live. 

Perhaps this sounds abstract, but it comes 
from the heart. Two weeks ago, I packed 
everything I owned, with the help of four 
strong, inestimably kind men into a mini 
warehouse in Solana Beach, and flew with my 
dog to Manhattan. Actually I didn 't fly to 
Manhattan, but that is where I ended up - in a one· 
bedroom apartment on the East side, midtown. 

But to give you a clearer picture of where I live, let me say 
that I live at the foot of a large bridge - the Queensborough 
Bridge, also known in popular songs as the 59th St. !:ridge, 
where people go to feel groovy. 

The advantages of living at the end of a bridge in a 
somewhat woomy building, where the hallways always 
smell like ord French fries, were not immediately apparent 
to me. First, most of the cars that came off the bridge carry 
New York license plates, which suggested that the drivers 
would be suspicious if I attempted to collect tolls out my 
bedroom window with a long pole and net . 

Second, I've lived on islands before, and I appreciate the 
effect that contact with moving water has on an already 
chilly winter wind. Finally, the eagerness and speed with 
which most drivers approach the bridge, in their haste to 
free themselves from what is consistently bumper to 
bumper traffic in Manhattan, makes crossing my street 
very exciting for the average pedestrian. 

At the same time I was getting used tothe bri.!ige,I had to 
transform myself from a laid· back California dog owner-
throw him out in the backyard at 10 am and let him in at 
midnight - into a conscientious, curb-your·dog New York 
City pet owner. This metamorphosis was more easily 
accomplished than I expected, due almost entirely to the 
fact that I have apparently been harboring for some three 
years a big·city dog. 

A brief summary of his character might make this 
statement more convincing. Dooley is a wire-haired fox 
terrier, with brown eyes that have been described as 
almond·shaped, lively, and coldly calculating. He is about 
eighteen inches high, but reserves violent hatred for d~ 
twice his size. He has a highly developed , almost paranOId 
sense of personal justice and an equally highly developed 
sense of revenge. In California he demonstrated these 
characteristics by attacking Doberman pinschers on pu blic 
beaches and reheving himself in houses he visited and 
didn't like. 

Maybe it was the flight that changed him. Being 
abandoned in front of the Eastern air terminal at Los 
Angeles International Airport, then thrown into a cold 
place with many suitcases, and finally put on a conveyor 
belt at JFK seems to have instilled an obsequious good 
humor into his muleish nature. Or maybe he believes that 
his dog companion Sluggo, enjoying California sunshine at 
my mom's house, was killed for behavior far less 
anarchistic than his own and that the same fate awaits 
him. 

But it isn't only the changes in character that proved 
Dooley to be a city slicker. He took to New York's sooty, 
garbage·studded streets with passionate affection. His nose 
never leaves the sidewalk, trodden by multitudes of other 
dogs, whose scents linger from rainstorm to rainstorm. He 
is fascinated by the innumerable, indescribablr. organic 
treats that have been crushed on the sidewalk and left to 

tel~aph promises of rank, rotten pleasure to dogs. 
Unlike California's predominantly macho or mellow 

large-dog owners, who view ~ fights as a manner of 
demonstrating prowess or lettmg animals be free to 
interact as they do in their own natural environment, New 
York pet owners make an effort to dissuade their animals 
from violent acts. And, for the first time in his career in the 
ring, Dooley is a large d~ in a city populated by Yorkies, 
Pugs and Pomeranians. If It hasn't humbled him, at least he 
has abandoned outright aggression for muttered 
hostilities. 

How does Dooley feel about forfeiting his mossy green 
turf for the cold granite of city pavements? He never 
enjoyed ¥Tass; ever since I've known him he 's preferred 
frequentmg patios and redwood decks to getting his feet 
damp on the lawn. Do you lie in the scratchy, buggy grass 
when you get out of the pool? No, and neither does Dooley -
who, by the way, swims at least three times aday when we

NEWS BRIEFS 

Senior Brown Raps 
Reagan Statements 

LOS ANGELES -
Saying Ronald Reagan's 
"deliberate lies" are costing 
him sleep, former Gov. 
Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Sr. 
demanded retraction yester· 
day of a TV commercial 
claiming Reagan saved 
California from bankruptcy 
when he succeeded Brown 13 
years ago. 

The state "was not on the 
verge of bankruptcy," said 
Brown, father of the current 
governor. "It had hundreds of 
millions of dollars on deposit 
in banks in special and 
general funds." 

Rea¥an's presiden t ial 
campatgn pi tch tells viewers 
that the former actor 
"inherited a state in crisis" 
from Brown and turned 
California's pending finan· 
cial doom into a surplus. 

While the commercial 
maintains that, by the end of 
1966, California had a $194 
million deficit and was 
spending $1 million a day 
more than it was taking in, 
Brown told a news confer· 
ence yesterday he left behind 
a $9 million surplus. 

He blamed any temrorary 
setback atthe timeon' acash 
flow crunch." 

"I certainly don't know 
where he (Reagan) got these 
figures," Brown added. 

"As I sit at home in myoId 
age watching those TV 
spots," the 75·year·old 
Brown said. "It disturbs my' 
sleep. At my age, you don t 
need your sleep disturbed." 

The elder Brown also 
withdrew an earlier 
statement that he plans to 
run for governor again , 
saying "I toyed with the idea 
for 25 hours, then I gave it 
up." 

Carter stands 
firm on Israel 

NEW YORK - Presi· 
dent Carter vowed yesterday 
he would not reassess US 
policy toward Israel and said 
a group supporting Ronald 
Reagan is falsely suggesting 
that he would negotiate with 
the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 

Carter sought to portray 
himself as the only candidate

with a legitimate claim to the 
vital Jewish vote in New 
York. 

And he tried out a new, 
rapid fire litany of the issues 
on which he claims he and 
Reagan disagree. 

Seeking to counter fears 
among some Jews that he 
might shift some of his 
support from Israel to Egypt 
in forthcoming summit talks 
on the Middle East, the 
president raised those 
concerns directly and sought 
to answer them. 

He said people are asking, 
" What about after the 
election? The record so far is 
very good, but isn't there a 
danger that President Carter 
might reverse US policy and 
turn his back on Israel some-
time in the future?" 

He replied to his own 
question: "Never ... This 
president will never reassess 
America's relationship with 
Israel" 

Carter said that one of the 
independent political 
committees · supporting 
Reagan had "completely 
misrepresented" Carter

Begin calls on 
Jews to unite 

JERUSALEM - Prime 
Minister Menachem Bfgin 
called on the Jews of Europe 
yesterday to defend them· 
selves against the awakeni~ 
"sav. animal" of antt· 
semittsm and to immigrate to 
Israel. 

Begin also condemmed the 
Soviet Union and Syria, 
which. he said ' were 
persecuting Jews and 
appealed to Western 
governments to campaign for 
emigration rights for Soviet 
a!ld. Syrian Jews. 

Begin's strong speech 
opening the winter session of 
parliament, the Knesset, 
came amid growing concerns 
ove a wave of anti·Semitic 
attacks in France, including 
the bombing of a Paris 
synagogue 10 days ago that 
killed four people. 

The syn~e bombing 
was at first attrIbuted to ne& 
Fascists. Israel also claimed 
Palestinian terrorists may 
have been involved. 

The born bing focused 
attention on ne&Naziam in 
Europe, and Frenchmen 
jammed the Champs Elysee 
last week to demand action 
from President Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing's govern· 
ment. 

Israelis also demonstrated 
at the French Embassy and 
Consulate, and Begin's 
Cabinet said it saw no ' 
difference between anti· 
Israel actions and anti· 
semitism. 

Both the Cabinet and Bfgin 
in his Knesset speech 
refrained from directly 
accusing the French 
government of responsibility.

Welfare moms attacked 
DANVILLE - "Breed-

ers" - women on welfare 
who have children - should 
either give up their children 
for adoption or lose welfare 
benefits, a state Assembly 
candidate says. 

Bill Baker, a RepUblican 
runnin~ for a 10th district 
seat, saId he doesn't object to 
an unmarried woman with 
one child receiving public 
assistance. 

"But when she has a 
second child, then we have to 
begin saying, well, that's one 
for adoption, because it needs 
two parents, it needs a 
home," he said in an 

interview with the Tri· VaIley 
News. 

"If you're goining to be a 
breeder, we're not going to 
subsidize it. I know it sounds 
harsh and cruel, but look at it 
from the kids J?Oint of view," 
he said. The mterview was 
published Sunday. 

Baker said his proposal 
was one method "to restore 
public confidence" in the 
welfare system. He said the 
adoption requirements would 
address a major concern of 
the general pu blic and would 
increase public acceptance of 
the \IT .. If",·,.

Travesty awaits year's first 
publication; promises hUIllor 

UCSD's hundred year·old 
humor journal will finally 
publish its first issue next 
month. 

T,avlS/Y, the 'UCSD 
Journal of Humor, is billed as 
the "oldest humor publica· 
tion in the United States," 
owing to the decision of the 
staff to retroactively found 
the journal in 1857. Tl'avtsly 
will feature essays, stories 
and graphics submitted by 
students, faculty and staff 
assembled into a traditional 
academic journal format. 
Traditional, .yes. Conven· 
tional, no. 

According to ~editor Sam 
Gooch, one way in which the 
journal will differ from other 
campus media is that no 
instItution will be considered 

"immune from persecution." 
Gooch stresses that Tl'ov, 
ts~ 3 intent is not solely 
mIrth. 

"At stake are far more 
desirable goals, such as 
awareness of community and 
exposure of corrupt or 
inefficacious social institu· 
tions," he says. 

College humor has 
traditionally consisted of 
irreverent and genteel pokes 
at hypocrisy and human 
folly, with a smattering of 
blue humor. Travtsly will be 
differently structured. 

The debut issue will be 
divided into three sections 
according to the editors. The 
first section will deal 
exc1us ively with issues 
directly aflecti .. the UCSD 
academic community. 
Section Two will consist of 
featured submiaaions from 
elieible contributors. (In 
addition to student writers, 
the staff has requested 
submissions from such 
notables as Dr. Seuas, Frmk 
ZaJlP8 and President Carter.) 

UCSD financial aid stable 

"Ideally, we would like to 
test the limits of the first 
amendment," said executive 
editor William Hamilton. "In 
lieu of this, however, we are 
incorporating into our 
contenta potpourri of 
humorous styles in order to 
appeal to a divergent 
audience. 

The last section of the 
journal - and the IDOIt 
controversial, hopes editorial 
editlX' Barry Alfonso - win 
feature a collective staff 
effort unified by the theme 
'Militant Alienation'. The 
purpose of this section is "to 
provide a forum thro\llh 
which purposeful change can 
evolve, and to examine the 
truly important social and 
political questions which 
'have arisen in the 20th 
century," said Alfonso. He 
declined to elaborate further. 

Editor's Note: In yeste,· 
day's issue of The Daily 
Guardian, the following story 
by Jane Gilbert was made 
incoherent by an erro, in 
production. We regret any 
inconvience this mistake may 
have caused and, as a service to 
our I'eflders, we are rerunning 
the story in its entirety. 

BY JANE GILBERT 
A greater number of UCSD 

students are receivin(t some 
type of financial assIstance 
says campus Deputy Director 
of Student Financial Services 
Fred Hessinger. 

"The UCSD Student 
Financial Services Office is 
able to provide adequate 
funding for all qualified 
needy students. Not all 
colleges and universities can 
make that claim," Hessinger 
says. 

feat\.wlng: 

The marked increase in 
funding results from the 
establishment of more liberal 
guidelines which allow a 
greater number of students 
to qualify for financial aids he 
says. With the pass~ of the 
New Higher Education Bill 
last week, more resources are 
available to all students, 
Hessinger says, especially 
those in the middle income 
bracket. 

The new bill was passed in 
response to increasing 
pressure from parents and 
students who felt that the 
Middle Income Assistance 
Act. passed several years ll8?, 
did not provide adequate aIds 
to meet their finanacial 
needs. 

Currently, about 40 
percent of the students at 
UCSD receive some type of 

color xeroxing, binding and lamination

financial aid, and perhaps 75 
percent of the student 
population here will use 
UCSD's financial aidservices 
in applying for guaranteed 
bank loans, veterans services 
and work study programs. 

The major problem which 
has confronted the staff has 
been a lack of good 
submissions. 

"While there have been a 
few literary gems, the 
majority of the contributions 
have vacillated between 
abysmally·sophomoric and 
comprehensible - but· to . 
God,"said Hamilton. Due to 
the on·going "pu blici,ty blitz" 
which the staff claims to be 
waging on the community, 
the copy situation is expected 
to improve before the October 
27 deadline. 

Hamilton stresses that the 
AS underwrite of TrovfSly is 
strictly a loan and not a 
financial gift. 

"We are perhaps the only 
student publication at UCSD 
to announce at its inception 
the intention of becomi~ 
self·sufficient as p-econdl' 
tional to any request for 
funding." he said. The staff 
views T,oVfSly as a potential 

Between $22·25 million 
will be given to students for 
financial aid thisyear in the 
UC system, Hessinger 
estimates. The system 
receives more federal dollars 
than many other institutions 
of similar size. "Better 
trained staffs" which are 
more skilled in soliciting 
financial aid funds generate 
more money for the UC 
system, Hessinger says.

'Father' of ntarine biology 
feted by Scripps staff 

A special symposium 
honoring Dr. Francis P. 
Shepard, often referred to as 
the "father of marine 
aoeobnr," will be held at 
Scripps Institution of 

~phy this Friday. 
Shepard, 84, will be given 

special tribute during the 
symposium at which his 
former students and other 
present marine geology 
students will present 
scientific papers . The 
prosram, to be held at 
Scripp's Sumner Auditor-
ium, will begin at 8:30 am and 
continue until 12:30 pm. The 
public is welcome. 

Arnone the s~ at the 
symposium will be two of 
Shepard's earliest ~aduate 
stuclenta from the mad·193OB, 
Drs . Kenneth Emery, 
Biaelow Professor emeritus 
at Woods Hole Oceano· 
graphic Institution, and 

Robert Dietz , former 
oceanographer for the 
National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration 
and now professor of marine 
geology at Arizona State 
University, Tempe. 

Other lecturers will be 
Scripps students and recent 
graduates, Dr. Charles 
Adelseck, Rachel Haymon, 
Dr. Scott Jenkins, Kim 
Kastens, and Mark Legg. 

Shepard, who is still 
actively involved in his 
research, pioneered the field 
of marine geol~ while a 
professor of ~.1Og)' at the 
University of Illinoas in the 
early 19308. He spent half of 
each year from 1937 to 1941 
at Scripps mnducting probes 
of scores of local submarine 
canyons. In 1942, he joined 
the University of California 
War Research Division and 
became a member of the 

Scripps faculty in 1945. 
Shepard's activit ies now 

include the study of currents 
in submarine canyons and 
sea-floor valleys off deltas, 
and the writing of textbooks 
and popular books about 
marine geology. He is one of 
the leading experts on the 
deterioration of local 
southern California beaches, 
and has been critical of some 
of the existing and proposed 
projects to alter the 
movement of sand. 

His text , Submarine 
Geolotrl, first published in 
1948 and now in its third 
edition, remains the standard 
text in the field. He is also the 
author of the popular books, 
Geological Oceanography and 
The Earth Beneath the Sea. 
Shepard and his wife , 
Elizabeth, reside in La 10lla.

Select members of the Associated Students of 

UCSD have been invited by President David S. Saxon 
to attend a formal reception honoring Chanellor and 
Mr-s. Richard C. Atkinson on Tuesday October 14, 
1980, from 4:30-6:30 pm at the Mandeville Center in 
the East Room. 
. The ASUCSD Council overwhelmingly voted to 

boycott and picket the reception in strong protest of 
the Chancellorial Search process which appointed 
Richard Atkinson to UCSD. We encourage all 
students to join the picket. 

Last year, the ASUCSD Council refused to 
legitimize the Chancellor's Search Process and 
condemned it as being undemocratic. Their demands 
for campus visitations by the final candidates for 
chancellor and disclosures of the criteria used in the 
selection process were not met. Furthermore, David 
Saxon, acting as spokesperson for the Search 
Committee, made it clear that the demands of the 
students were unimportant. 

We feel it is imperative that we continue this 
protest in affirmation of our firm conviction that the 
upcoming Vice·Chancellor appointments - as well as 
all future search and appointment processes - be 
conducted with significant student input. 

The ASUCSD is not protesting against €hancellor 
Atkinson, but rather President Saxon. 

Join the Picket 
Tuesday October 14 
Gym Steps - 3:45 pm 

(Will meet and proceed to Mandeville Center for Picket)
