UC Davis Keep the

DAVIS - The UC Davis 
Academic Senate overwhelm-
ingly voted in favor of keep-
ing the quarter system, as 
opposed to converting to the 
semester system. Of the 1,157 
ballots received, 810 voted in 
favor of the quarter system, 
251 favored the semester con-
version and 86 indicated no 
preference. Three weeks ago, 
undergraduate students also 
overwhelmingly voted to 
remain on the quarter system. 
Graduate students al so voted 
against the measure. "1 think

UC SAN DIEGO THUR DAY. JANUARY 8, 1998 VOLUM 93, ISSUE 2 

UCSD Joins Local Digital Library 
BOOKS:SDSU,USD 
and CSUSM also will 
take part in alliance 
By Anna Valsman 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students will be able to 
expand their literary horizons when 
the San Diego County Library 
Circuit Consortium is implemented 
on Jan. 26. In the first program of 
its kind in California, students can 
access books from UCSD, San 
Diego State University, the 
University of San Diego and 
California State University San 

Marcos within a single working 
day. 

The traditional method of 
obtaining books unavai lable in 
one's home library is the interli -
brary loan, which requires an aver-
age of two weeks for the requested 
book to arrive. The consortium is a 
shortcut, allowing users to acquire 
materials via a courier van that will 
stop at each of the librarie ' in the 
consortium twice a day. 

The circuit consortium does not 
fully replace interlibrary loans. It 
includes only San Diego libraries, 
whereas interlibrary loans can 
acquire books from out of town or 

even out of state. 
At UCSD, however, almost one-

third of past loan requests could 
have been filled by holdings from 
one of the other libraries in the con-
sortium, according to UCSD 
University Librarian Gerald 
Lowell, who is also associate vice 
chancellor of academic information 
technology at UCSD and chairman 
of the San Diego Library Circuit 
Consortium Steering Committee. 

When a book is requested from 
an interlibrary loan, the staff used 
to look to other UC libraries first. 

" It 's a pecking order as to where 
~e start first," said Lowell. "What 

we're doing with the cirCUli IS 
changing that pecking order: San 
Diego lirst, then UC, then else-
where." 

For UCSD students, faculty and 
staff, this consortium translates into 
easier and faster access to 700,000 
titles not available at the Geisel 
Library, which holds about 2.5 mil-
lion titles in its collections. 

"\t·s a marriage of technology 
and the realities of library financing 
in the '90s," said Nancy Carol 
Carter, director of USD's law 
library, the Legal Research Center. 
"The most important thing is access

Police Launch Investigation into Coffee Poisoning 
SPIKED: Six scientists 
drank beverage laced 
with acry1amide 
By Sara Snyder 
Staff Writer 

Call it one wicked brew. 
On the morning of Nov. 5, six 

researchers at the UCSD School of 
Medicine were rushed to hospital 
emergency rooms after drinking 
coffee laced with the neurotoxic 
chemical acrylamide during a lab 
meeting. 

After tests revealed that the 
quantity of acrylamide found in 
both the coffee and the coffee 
grounds was too great to be dis-
missed as an accidental contamina-
tion, campus police launched a 
criminal inve tigation into the inci-
dent. 

According to UCSD Assistant 
Police Chief Jay Dyer, campus 
detectives are conducting inter-
views and gathering information, 
but as of yet, have failed to identify 
any suspects. 

'The poison victims, two gradu-

ate students and four staff mem-
'bers, experienced "almost immedi-
ate nausea and weakness," said 
Ruth Covell, an Associate Ocan at 
the School of Medicine. However, 
the amount of acrylamide found in 
the "Coffee did not approach lethal 
levels and the researchers were able 
to return to work that same day. 

Despite this speedy recovery, 
Covell said little_ is known about 
the long term health implications of 
this type of acrylamide exposure. 

"Most of what is known about 
the effects of acrylamide hu to do 

with peripheral nerve effect of 
chronic exposure," Covell said. 
"There is little information in the 
literature about a single acute expo-
sure." 

Acrylamide is a white, water-
soluble crystal used to make gels 
for protein analysis. According to 
Covell, this chemical is common 
and easily accessible to those work-
ing within the medical school, but 
one that an outsider would be 
unable to attain.

Physicist· Rosenbluth Awarded 
National Medal of Science 
PRIZE: The UCSD 
professor was one of 
nine scientists to win 
By Kara Carlos 
Staff Writer 

Physics Professor Marshall 
Rosen~luth was one of nine scien· 
tists awarded the National Medal of 
Science from Presidem Bill Clinton 
at a ceremony held in the Old 
Executi ve Office on Dec. 16. 

Selected by a 12·member. pres· 
idential ·appointed committee of 
scienli sts and engineers, 
Rosenbluth received Ihe nation 's 
highest science and engineering 
honor for his discoveries in ther-
monuclear fusion and his cOnlribu-
tions to plasma physics and compu-
tational statistical mechanics. 

At the ceremony, Commerce 
Secretary William M . Daley recog-
nized the medal recipients for their 
outstanding contributions to science. 

"We honor these individuals 
with America 's version of the 
Nobel Prize," Daley said. "Their 
work and vision embodies the vital 
link between technology and inno-

vation. " 
Rosenbluth made one of his most 

valuable contributions to the sc ien-
tific tield in 1975. He realized that 
the agitated state of Alfven waves 
by high energy ions in a Tokamak 
reactor - a type of reactor devel· 
oped in the former Soviel Union that 
is expected to generate elect ri city -
was an important , though formerly 
overlooked, source of stability that 
began the transformation to a burn-
ing plasma. 

This work became the standard 
for models of activity in a Tokamak 
reactor and found many important 
purposes outside the fusion·research 
community . 

For more I han 40 years. 
Rosenbluth has worked to develop 
controlled thennonuclear fusion as an 
unlimited source of energy. 

He also continues as a consul · 
tant to the Department of Defense 
on national security issues. anti · 
submarine warfare and free·elec-
tron lasers. 

The National Medal of Science. 
established by Congress and 
administered by the National 
Science Foundation, honors the 

impact of individuals who deserve 
special recognition for their excep· 
tional conlributions to the physical. 
biologica l, mathematical or engi-
neering 'ciences. 

-The medal has now been award-
ed Lo 353 prominent scientists and 
engineers. Recipienls include 
Eugene M. Shoemaker. co-discover· 
er of the Shoemaker-Levy comet, 
and C. Kumar N. Patel, who invenl· 
ed the carbon dioxide laser Ihat 
helped to revolutionize medic~ 1 
surgery . 

John Hocker, executive director 
of the Nalional Science and 
Technology Medal s Foundation. 
said, at the ceremony, that it is 
important to recognize scientific 
achievement. 

"The laureates of the Nalional 
Meda l of Science and the National 
Medal of Technology are national 
Ireasures whose intellect and inge· 
nuity help light our way to a better 
future," Hocker said. "This country 
achieved greatness. in part . through 
its vast natural resources. Among 
our most valuable resources are our 
National Medal Laureates, past, 
present and future."

olltreach effort ," Chancellor Robert 
Dynes said. "We will benefit from 
Ed Lopez's experience and leader-
shi p as we improve access 10 
UCSD's outreach programs. and 
work with our colleagues in the 
community to create new opportu· 
nities for young people throughout 
San Diego to succeed in educa-
tion." 

In a press release, L opez stated 
that he will be " working with exist· 
ing programs to help coordinate all 
efforts to ensure that the university 
is realizing maximum benefits." 

Currently, there arc over 70 out-
reach programs and, as coordinator, 
Lopez will promote these programs 

to school s throughout the San 
Diego and Imperial Counties. 

Lopez stated that he will "help 
coordinate. facilitate. to make sure 
there is a continuity in service, 
meaning, if we can work with the 
students at the elementary grade 
level, we can continue to work with 
them at the high school level." 

Some of the ex isting outreach 
programs at UCSD include the 
Early Academic Outreach 
Program, Upward Bound and

UC Eligibility Proposal 
Hurts Qualified Students 

In wake of the recent backlash against affi rmative 
action , we comme nd Sen. Te resa Hughes (D-
Ing lewood) in her aLtempt to recti fy the dec lining 
dive rsity in Ca lifornia's publi c univers tltes . 
However, her UC E li gibility Proposal - admi tting 
the top 12.5% of each high school's graduating class 
- is ineffective as it now stands. 

Numerous studies have indicated that admission 
into co llege is socioeconomicall y-based. Those wi th 
the financial means to pay for SAT-preparatory 
courses and co llege-preparatory high schools have a 
leg up over their less soc ioeconomica lly advantaged 
counterparts. In admissions decisions, colleges heav-
ily weigh SAT scores and account for the strength of 
students' academic curriculum, thereby excluding 
those of the lower-midd le and working class. 

II is laudable that Hughes recogni zes thi s di screp-
ancy. By the same toke n, howe ver, Hughes neg lec ts 
to acknowledge the s igni ficance of thi s di sc repancy. 
Although the proposal addresses to level the playing 
field for lower-middle class and working class stu-
dents, it is detrimenta l to those who attend academi-
cally competitive high schools. To admit only the top 
12.5% of students at schools, such as La 10lla High, 
would severely and unfairly limit the remaining num-
ber of those students who meet UC e ligibility 
requirements but fall lower in class rank than the ir 
more competitive counterparts. 

The proposal will encourage students to enroll in 
less rigorous classes for an easy "A" or transfer to 
less competitive hi gh schools - to mention just a 
couple, among many, of fo reseeable problems. 
Although Hughes' intent is well -taken , she must 
revise her proposal to better serve all of California's 
high school students. 

Increase in UCSD Spirit is 
an Excellent Sign 

For two nights last monlh, UCSD shook off its 
apathy and showed its spirit. More than 4,000 yelling 
and screaming Triton fans came out to RIMAC Arena 
to cheer the women 's volleyball team on to the 
nati onal title . 

The energy the fans ex hibited was outstanding. 
Down two games to none in the championship match 
agai nst Juniata College (Pa.) on Saturday, Triton fans 
refu ed to give up. As the learn mounted one of the 
greatest comebacks of a ll time, almost everyone in 
the arena stood up and started cheering. The cheering 
did not end until the championship was firm ly in 
Triton hands . 

While the en thusiasm of the crowd was over-
whelming, let's not forgel the lackluster crowds that 
came out to upport the learn during the season. UCSD 
teams deserve the campus ' support all year long. 

By the way, the next big chance to yell your head 
orr will be at Spirit Ni ght later thi s month .

POVERTY IS THE INEVITABLE 
REsULT OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION 
COMMENTARY: Although writer believes New Year's resolutions are silly, she 
strives for self-improvement by examining her periodic financial insolvency 

MEG A N 
K LEI N 

Reality Check 

I am not one to make New Year's 
resolutions. In fact, I am not a very big 
fan of New Year's Eve. Who came up 
with the idea of a holiday to celebrate 
the passine of time? Oh yippee, I get 
to buy a new calendar and forget to 
write 1998 on all my checks. For 
goodness sake, time passes every day, 
why celebrate now? 

But far be it for me to rai n on any-
one's parade. If you like New Year's 
Eve, party all you want. I'm nOl goi ng 
to stop you. Make all the resolutions 
yo u want - lose those ex tra 50 
pounds. stop being an obsessive gam-
bier, start taki ng showers and wear 
deodorant again. However, I am not 
about to make a New Year's reso lu-
tion. 

Instead, I have decided to make a 
Super Life Changing Declaration uf 
Personal Responsibility (SL DPR). 
As you can seQ from the title, it is not 
a resolution, but a declarati on that I 
have something to change. The decla-
ration also has nothi ng to do with the 
pass ing of the year. which IS why it is 
not a New Year '~ declaration. 'W 
Year', just happens to be the time 
when the LCDPR has become 
inevitable. 

My oni ial, L DPR is the fullow-
ing: I will no longer he poor. 

But I am supposed to be a "poor, 
starving co lleg0 student." yOll say. 
College students, by their very nature, 
must be poor. Yes, I agree. I shou ld be 
scrounging for change under my 
couch cushions, stealing sugar and cat-
up packets from rast -food reStaurants 

I lived In the lap of 
luxury for an entire 
quarter while my 
account balance was 
taking a downward 
spiral. Now I shiver In 
my dark room while 
giving my checkbook 
CPR. Right here, right 
now, I vow to be 
frugal. 
and knitting sweaters made from dryer 
lint. 

nfortunately, then: comes a time 
in yo ur college career when you rea l-
il.e that there is a directly proportional 
relationship between the amount of 
freedom a child has from her parents 
and the amount of out-of-pocket 
expenses she acquires. The longer one 
is in ,chool. th - more ex pensive it 
gets. Then you realile something must 
be done about it. 

Of cour~c, I haven't always had it 
su bad. In fact. some years have been 
pretty good. So let us just take a quick 
trip into the past and review a fairly 
nonnal example of the progression of 

student expenses. 
In a typical freshman year, all a stu-

dent has 10 pay for is the phone bill 
and personal entertainment. An espe-
cially unlucky student will have to pay 
for books, too. Otherwise, expenses 
are at a minimum. Parents get the 
housing and the tuition bill, and food 
is paid in the form of points on the stu-
dent 1.0. Heck, you even get free 
cable! 

During sophomore year, most stu -
dents li ve in an on-campus apartment. 
Parent s still get the housing and 
tu ition, but now trips to the grocery 
store are required for food . The likeli-
hood of owning a car also increases, as 
do expenses when gas and parking 
permits are factored in. And it on ly 
gets worse. (But at least you still get 
free cable.) 

By their junior year, students are 
living in their off-campus apanments 
and enjoying the extra freedom. 
Unfortunately, they are not enjoying 
the extra expenses. 

Suddenly, you find out you actually 
have to pay for watching the 24-hour 
"Facts of Life" marathon in the form 
of an electric and a cable bi II. Take a 
four-hour shower and it shows up on 
both your water ancl electri c bill (You 
mean hot water is nut jUM naturally 
hot'! I thought they piped it in from a 
local hot spring!). 

The distance from ~chool mean~ 
you have to cOlllmute, which means 
ex tra gas expenses. The distance also 
causes you to n:a lize that the UCSD 
campus, Ralphs and UTC aren 't the 
on ly things out there. So you begin to 
explore the area for exciting activities 
and begin tu exp lore your wallet for 
more cash. ollege becomes very 
expensive. 

That is pretty much how my col-

COMMENTARY: One student questions whether a ridiculous battle 
against bureaucracy is worth the reward of preserving his creative license 

THE STORY OF A MAN AND HIS SPA 
Sunshine Store & Revelle Sundry Store present: 

holiday photo special 
ANY color print roll! 

By Mark Smith 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Perhaps you saw my balcony 
last year. It was the one with the big 
overhang made out of palm lea ves. 
Yeah. the one wri tten about in the 
Gllardiall last year. Or perhaps you 
didn ' t sec it. If not, it is probably 
because UCSD Housing and 
Dining Services forced me to take 
it down. 

Maybe you heard ahuut the spa 
on my balcony thi s year. TJ1,)\'S 
rig ht - a fu ll-Iledged redwood spa 
- with jets. a pump and a filter. 

0'1 Well that may be because it 
met a simil ar fate - one more 
casualty of the war between hOlls-
ing and creative student s. 

Did somebody say WAR?! You 
heard me. I have been in a constant 
battl e with housi ng over my ri ghts 
as a tenant in the apartment s. 
Apparentl y. I have none. Here's the 
story: 

During winter quarter of last 
yea r, I became rea ll y bored. I 
decided that. as in all periods of 
overwhelming monotony, it was 
time to build something. 

I presented my dilemma to my 
roommates and we began brain-
storming. We came up with two 
good ideas - a spa and an over-
hang. Since we were on a fourth -
floor balcony, a spa had too much 
carnage potenti al, so we decided to 
bui Id the overhang, setting the spa 
aside until we acquired the fi rst-
Iloor apartment we have this year. 

Before building each of these 
magnificent balcony appendages, I 
did my homework. I gathered all of 
the papers I had signed and re-read 
them. 

I also pi cked up the little book 
or li es they like to call the "Warren 
Housing Handbook." I found noth-
ing which forbade either the bal-
cony overhang or the spa in any or 
those papers. 

So why did I have to take them 
down? You are going to love this. 
The Overhang (a.k.a. The 
Palapa) 

Upon first learning of my newly 
constructed balco ny coveri ng, 
Warren Residentia l Life (a .k.a. 
Res. Life) sent a lette r explaining 
that housing services had demand-

Determined to win 
this dispute, 
I went to see 
Student Legal 
Services. 
In their opinion, 
Housing Services 
could not ask me to 
remove my spa. 
They said that they 
would contact 
Housing Services 
and Res. Ufe and 
get back to me. 
cd it s removal and that I had un ti l 
the weekend to remove it. I was 
detemlined to get an ex pl anation as 
to why. 

I set up a meeti ng with Res. Lire 
and learned nothing more, only 
their finger pointing at the housi ng 
admi nistration and a vague refer-
ence to a rule forbidding eyesores. 
It was not an eyesore so I went 
straight to the housing office. 

I met with AI Alarcon, who had 
initially demanded removal, and 
confronted him. He told me it was 
Res. Lire's ultimate decision and 
that I should speak with the people 
there - again, more linger point-
ing. I sel up another meeting. 

By th is time, a picture of the 
balcony had appeared on the front 
page of the Guardian, which in 
tum upset housing services. At the 
meeting, I was inrormed that they 
had brandished all their weapons 
and had even ca lled in a fire mar-
shall. The fire marshall declared it 
a fire hazard without even inspect -

ing it and ordered it s removal. 
Thi s amuscd mc, so I did a lillie 

more research. I found out that 
Douglas Hall , the huilling I was 
li ving in , was constructed of rehar 
(long steel poles) and cinder block. 

I thought that maybc I had been 
wrong all my Ii i'e and jllst missed 
the day in schoo l when we were 
taught that steel and brick were 
l'iammable. So I did an experimcnt. 
Despite my lise of matches, gaso-
line, and oxy-acetylcnc torches, I 
was unable tu ignite ti ther the rehar 
or ci nder block. 

To he fair, the rebar did begin to 
glow around 2000°C, yet there was 
no !lame. I intended to bring my 
di scovery to the fire marshall , but I 
was denied an appointment. 

Unab le to tight the phantom lire 
marshall and a housing department 
hell-bent on th warting my creati vi -
ty. the covering was moved inside 
the apartment , where it sat behind 
the couch for the remainder or the 
year. Apparently, they fe lt that it 
was less of a fire hazard inside. 

My roo mmates and I immedi-
ately began to brainstorm for a new 
and improved balcony appendage, 
preferabl y, one which would not 
ignite. 

Housing: I, Creative Student: 0 
The Spa 

I built our spa during the first 
quarter of this year. My room mates 
were so happy that they named it 
the Original Redwood Gigantic 
Aqueous Spa of Manliness 
(O.R.G.A.S.M.). 

We were sure we were safe. No 
fire marshal - phantom or not -
could declare a six-foot diameter 
spa fill ed with water a fire hazard. 
Funhermore, we were on the first 
Iloor this year, so we didn ' t have to 
worry about any balcony weight 
limit. 

We recei ved the letter to remove 
our spa about a week after its com-
pletion. (Luckily, they were too late 
for our Halloween Party). Again, 
we were gi ven no reason why so I 
met with Res. Life represe ntative 
Larry Barret who, I learned, had 
ordered its removal. 

Again , we had violated no ru les 
of any contract guide lines we

MONEY:

lege expenses have gone. I suppose 
it would not be so bad if I had a 
we ll-paying job, but I have an 
entire bucket full of factors oppos-
ing the need for my banking 
account balance to increase. 

The first factor is Christmas. 
It seems that as J get older, 

au tomatica lly assume I can afford 
mun: expensive presents, even if 
my checkbook does not agree. 
Plus, I feel had for never writing to

signed. Instead, we were supposed 
to remove it due to liability. 
Apparently, they feared someone 
would drown in it during the night 
or it might suddenly explode and 
flood our apartmenl. 

Again, I questioncd their logic. 
We had a double padlock on a 

any of my friends or family - I 
figurc a really nice present will 
make up for it. 

So my credit cards dance at cash 
registers everywhere. I actually had 
my first fear that I hit my credi l 
limit. I got really scared when I 
considered whether it was truc - I 
would have to pay a bill fi ve times 
larger than my checkbook would 
allow. Luckily, I rca li zed the fcar 
was ridiculous, and moved on to 
the ncxt store. 

Fortunately, for mc, I haven' t 
received my bills yet, so I won 't be 
dead for another few weeks. Look 
for my obituary in the newspaper 
t hen. Christmas is an evi I consu mer 

wooden cover over the spa which 
was always locked while Ihe spa 
was nOl in use. I tri ed standing 011 
top of it, hoping to miracu lously 
break through the wood, but to no 
avail. I thcn attempted to construt:t 
a wormhole from our living room 
into the spa. Again, no luck. 

I determined that, to drown in 
the spa, someone would literally 
have to come with an ax and hack 
his way through our cover, without 
anyone noticing, and then si lently

The second factor is my income. 
Freshman year I got a joh at the 

bookstorc. My small $90-a-weck 
paycheck covered my expenses and 
required only 15 hours of work a 
week. 

There I slaved until February of 
1997, when J started working for 
this lovely ncwspaper. 

My paycheck took a turn for the 
worse. It dropped to a mere $55 a 
week, plus a few bucks every once 
in a while for writing articles. My

Two weeks later, I got a leller

LOPEZ: 
New director will 
help C.R.E.A.T.E. -
Continued from pa~. 3 
ing programs try 10 make informa-
tion avai lab le to students and fami -
lies about requirements to attend a 
university like UCSD. The pro-
grams also help them leam about 
fi nancial aid possi bilities. 

Outreach programs work to 
moti vale students 10 stay in school 
and to help them improve their aca-
demic performance at the K- 12 
level. 

Some outreach programs intro-
duce students to panicular areas. 
like the sciences or math, and even 
give them opponunities 10 panici -
pate in re search by connecting 
them with faculty members. 

"An imponant goal is increas-
ing the number of sm;ioeconomi -
cally disadvantaged students who 
become eligible for and enroll at 
UC campuses as a result of out-
reach programs, which will help 
ensure diversi ty through our sys-
tem," Lopez stated. 

Paul Drake, dean of Social 
Sciences and co-chair of the Task 
Force on K-12 Outreach. said he 
believes the appointment of Lopez 
is pivotal if UCSD is to adopt the 
recommendations of the Task Force 
on K-12 Outreach. 

"We are fortunate to have an 
individual with Ed Lopez's back-
ground in education and communi-
ty leadership assume the position 
of outreach coordinator at this piv-
otal time," Drake said. "As we 
move forward with planning for a 
model school and enhanced out-
reach activities, coordination will 
be more critical than ever. 

"" is also impor1anl Ihal we 
deve lop and maintain strong rela-
tionships with schools, administra-
tors, counselors, teachers, students, 
parents and communit ies, so that 
our efforts achieve maximum suc-
cess," Drake added. 

The K- 12 Outreach Task Force 
also recommended the establi sh-
ment or a unit called Center for 
Research in Educational Equity 
Assessment and Teaching 
Excellence (C.R.E.A.T.E.), which 
will consist of UCSD faculty and 
administrators, and will provide 
oversight and coordination of out-
reach activi ties. Lopez will work 
closely with the faculty director, 
helping to coordinate programs and 
serving as a liaison between the 
schools and the pUblic. 

Lopez is a UCSD graduate with 
a B.A. in urban studies and plan-
ning. He earned his law degree 
from Boalt Hall at UC Berkeley in 
199 I. Lopez has served as a coun-
selor in UCSD's Early Academic 
Outreach Program, and is currently 
president of the UCSD 
Chicano/Latino Alumni Council.

indie-rock mecca of Olympia, 
Wash. has to offer - shows 

off some of their most raucous and 
discordant sounds yet on their latest 
release, Challenge for a Civilized 
Society. 

On this album, the band features 
its signature stylistic dichotomies 
and eXlremes, punctuated by Sara 
Lund 's powerful drumming. Its intri-
cate, layered music is as non-tradi-
tional as it is cathartic, varying from 
lulling distonion and feedback to the 
dark, raging screeches of frontman 
and guitarist Justin Trosper. 

What Unwound's members lack 
in verbal communication, they 
express through their unpredictable 
experimenls with sound. style and 
lyrics. Unwound clearly expect the 
music to speak for itself,

Art Imitates Life in IDeconstructing Harryl 
Classic Woody Allen humor and an all-star cast make Aliens latest creative endeavor a must-see 

By Ilona F ... 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

While "Dcconstructing Harry" 
is a fun romp in Woody-land. one 
can't help but think that Allen uses 
his latest film as a forum to purge 

OI her women, in Ihal order. 
Because hi s besl-selling novels are 
based on real people, iI's easy to 
understand why Block has alienat-
ed those close t to him. 

This poses a problem for Block

ruminate about 
hi s disgruntled 
sex life. And 
with Allen's 
recent marriage 
to adoplt'd 
daughter Soon-
Y!, it 's no won-
der that his latest 
creal ion is aboul 
a fru strated 
writer who suc-
:eeds in the lit-
! rary world yet 

With that said, the 
combination of 
classic Woody 
humor and an all-

Shue and Kirstie 
Alley), make.

has no one to 
share the 
moment with. 

While the 
usual slew of 
psyc ho lo gists 
and neurotic 
characters are 
sti II present, 
what separates 
this film from 

What once seemed romantic -
.he passionate affairs and star-
;rossed lovers that characterize 
~ast Allen films - now just seems 
Jncomfortable and dirty. 

With Ihal said, Ihe combination 
)f classic Allen hu mor and an all-

the rest of Allen's is the plot struc-
ture. (nterspersed throughout the 
main story line are comical . short 
vignettes, each one a synopsis of 
Block's previous bestsellers. 

His guilt about his obsession 
with prostitutcs manifcsts it self 
into a story about a horny shoe-
store salesman whose indulgence 
in a cheap fantasy proves fa tal. His 
parents become the central charac-
ters in a story about murder and 
cannihalism.

Film Review ._------------

Gracious: Waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) delivers an overwhelming thank-you note to Melvin 
Udall (Jack Nicholson) for his unexpected act of philanthropy in "As Good As It Gets_" 

It Really Is 1\s Good As It Gets' 
Jack is still shining as Hollywood's best cuckoo 

By Ilona Fa .. 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

In an age in which failing to be 
politically correct is the surest way 
to kill a thriving film career, pro-
ducer and director James L. 
Brooks, known for both "Cheers" 
and 'The Simpsons," takes a risk 
with his latest film, "As Good As It 
Gets." Saturated with jokes sure to 
raise the eyebrows of those of any 
race, religion or sexual orientation. 
the fi I m is ed gy to say the least. 

Aside from being well-made, 
"As Good As It Gets" may act as a 
jumping board for the public to 
voice its opinion on just how liber-
al filmmakers should be (After all, 
groups that get huffy when an 
actress smokes a cigarette on film 
do exist). 

Political agendas aside, Jack 
Nicholson excellently portrays 
Melvin Udall, a biller romance 
novelist who suffers from an obses-
sive-compulsive disorder. 

From the elaborate ritual he car-
ries out at mealtimes, to Ihe way he 
walks (he feels compelled to avoid 
cracks on the floor) the disease 
infiltrates every aspect of hi s life. 

So when Carol (Helen Hunl), 
the only waitress who can tolerate 
his acid tonguc at the local restau-
rant, mi sses work to care for her 
severely athsmatic SO il , Melvin will 

Critics of Brooks 
ar,ue that his films 
are characterized 
by Jllb lines and 
slick finishes. 
However, with "As 
Good As It Gets," 
the line. aren't 
softened and there's 
no candy coating. 

do whatever it takes to get her 
back. What starts out as a selfish 
desire to have his schedule return 
to normal, turns inlO a valiant acl. 

Little by little, the man who 
throws dogs down garbage chutes 
and calls homosexuals "fudge 
packers," falls in love. 

Crilics of Brooks argue that his 
films are characterized by glib lines 
and slick finishes . However, with 
"As Good As h Gels," lines aren't 
softened and Ihe seriousness of Ihe 
di sorder isn't candy-coated. Brooks 
mainlains the gri ltiness requi red by 
expertly manipul aling the camera's 
eye. For example, by mak ing a 
point 10 locus in on Carol's ycl -
lowed teeth , hc succeeds in replac-
ing Ihe movie-star glitz of a big-
name actress such as Hunl, with the 

realistic ponrayal of a single moth-
er struggling to survive. 

Switching from one emotion to 
another at the drop of a hat, and 
conveying that feeling to hi s audi-
ence with as little as a raised eye-
brow, makes Nicholson's perfor-
mance worthy of an Oscar. 

One can almost see the sweat on 
the foreheads of his co-stars Cuba 
Gooding Jr., Greg Kinnear and 
Helen Hunt, in the attempt to reach 
the same level. The one person who 
seems terribly oul of place is 
Carol's mother (played by Shirley 
Night). 

Perhaps the most important 
message the film has to offer lies in 
the inherent irony of Melvin's char-
acter. Underneath his unpleasant 
exterior is a man whose acts are far 
more worthy of respect than the 
everyday ni ceness most people 
exhibit. 

While one may argue that the 
character' s edges were too rough to 
be reali stica lly smoot hed over 
(Melvin is magically curcd with a

Altoon's Work Innovative Yet Disturbing 
ArtistJohn Altoon's bizarre and beautiful works are on display in downtown La Jolla 

By Jennifer Feldman 
Guardian Reporter 

The John Alloon exhibi tion at the: Museum 
of Contemporary Art in downtown La Joll a is 
both promising and innovalive. 

Alloon 's work , a product of the 1950s and 
60s. contains indi vidualistic expression. Altoon 
was also fundamental in the shaping of modem 
art. 

John Altoon 's earlier works, abst ract 
expressionist paintings and drawings, depict 
strong emotions. Painted wi th oi l on canvas. 
these images project the importance of attitude 
and self-expression over style. 

Early paintings, such asAltoon's Ocean Park 
Series, glow with vivid colors and enthusiasm. 
However, the multitude or colors and curves 
makes the meaning of these drawings elusive. 
Much of Altoon 's early work is hard to relate to. 

Although much easier to understand. John 
Altoon 's mid-1960s works are difficult to 
appreciate. Continuing his drawings of the 
female form, Altoon's images of nude women 
are not the typica l depiction of beauty. Rather, 
they are harsh and sensual. 

Much of his displayed work does not con-
tain the full figures of women and men. 
Instead, he concentrates purely on their geni-
talia. These drawings often depict disembod-
ied vaginas and hovering penises. 

In one strange painting, penises fry like 
sausages in a skillet, while tongs wrap around a 
female's vagina. In other such drawings, vagi-
nas are portrayed with frogs and li zards leaping 
out of them. 

These works are interesting but disturbing. 
It may lead an observer to believe that Altoon 
did not like women. 

The last part of the exhibition provides a 
display of Altoon's most identifying stylistic

feature - his airbrush technique. Unusual 
organic shapes, outlined in ink and fl oating on 
a white or dotted background, are given both 
depth and color. Although it is hard to grasp the 
precise meaning of these paintings, they main-
tain a certain sex ual quality that is quite repre-
sentative of Altoon's work. 

John Altoon spent most of hi s time painting 
in a studio in Venice Beach. His work was 
especially influential in Southern California's 
art society. During a time when hi s an was 
flouri shing, Altoon was diagnosed with schizo-
phrenia and hospitali zed. 

When he was released, he continued to paint 
odd. yet intriguing, drawings that have dominant 
Picasso-esque features . Altoon is truly unique in 
his style, and his ex hibition at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art is highly recommended. 

Asi de from being a well -kept, modern 
museum with an unmatched view of the La 
Jolla Cove, the Museum of Contemporary Art 
is unique and elegant. 

The John Altoon exhibition will be shown 
through March II. For more information about 
Alloon's display or upcoming events, contact 
the museum at 454-3541.

'Fallen' Attempts To Thrill, But falls Short 
Even Denzel Washington's strong performance can't pick this film up off the ground 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Don' t piss off psychotic, mani -
acal ethereal beings with too much 
time on their hands. That appears 
to be the moral of Denzel 
Washington's latest film, "Fallen." 

"Fallen" has a good premise. 
and shows promise of being an 
interesting film. However, most of 
that promise is left unrealized as 
the film becomes caught up in its 
supernatural elements. The film's 
villain is a blob of green ectoplas-
mic gas. and so "Fallen" struggles 
to get the audience to truly loathe 
its evil antagonist. 

For a film that is supposed to 
be a thriller, "Fallen" does not 
manage to keep audience mem-
bers on the edge of their seats and. 
besides being a bit unbelievable, 
its "surprise" ending does not real-
ly catch anyone otT guard who 
pays close attention to the details 
presented earlier in the film. 

Washington plays decoraled 
homicide delective John Hobbes, 
who at the inception of the action 
wilnesses the execution of serial-
killer Edgar Reese. played by 
Elias Koteas, whom he tracked 
and brought to justice. 

As he is led into the gas cham-

Side" by the Rolling Stones. a 
song that wi II become the film's 
dark anthem. Reese inhales the

NOISE: 
Orie of Olympia's 
loudest bands 
Continued from page 9 

When we started, we pretty 
much played only all-ages shows. 
Primarily, we still do, and if we play 
a bar, we'll try to do an all-ages 
thing the day before or the day after. 
All-ages venues are always popping 
up and disappearing. We're playing 
the Casbah in San Diego [which is 
21 and over], but we're also playing 
at Off The Record . 
Even though you've been 
consistent, the music scene 
in Olympia has grown and 
changed considerably. 

Every thing has complctely 
changed since we startcd . 
Every thing has gOllen a lot more 
corporate and organized. 
Organization is good, though. Kill 
Rock Stars [Unwound 's label] has 
changed a lot, but in a good way. 
They're a lot more on top of what 
they'rc doing. 
Wasn't Unwound one of the 
reasons KiI Rock Stars st.1· 
ed releasing rock records? 

Not spec ifically because of us, 
but we were kind of like the first 
rock band that Slim [Moon, owner 
of Kill Rock Stars] wanted to put 
out records for. 
Are you touring with any· 
one? 

Yeah. A ·band from here called 
The Tight Bros and a band from L.A. 
called Godzik Pink. Actually, The 
Tight Bros' whole name is The Tight 
Bros From Way Back When. We try 
to set up our tours where we pick out 
all the bands, so we don't have to 
play with bands we don't like. 
What instruments do you 
use when you play live? 

Just guitar, bass. drums. 
What about an the electron· 
ic stuff that's been showing 
up on your work more and 
more just recently? 

[Producer] Steve Fisk has a lot 
of that stuff, and he plays it on the 
album. 
Will you have him playing 
live with you on any tour 
dates? 

No. We've discussed it. but no. 
Is this album more studio-
oriented than the others? 

Yeah. We didn' t even practicc 
that much before we recorded, and 
a lot of the stuff we just finished up 
in the studio. We had a lot more 
time to do that, too. 
Did you take a different 
approach this time, stylisti. 
cally? 

A little bit. We talked about 
recording somewhere other than 
Seattle, and we stayed there. Then 
Steve suggested that we record 
each song by song, like recording 
all the rhythm tracks first, then the 
guitar and drums, then the vocals. 

So this timc we kind of just did 
a song. then played around with the 
song, especially with the drum 
sounds. Almost every song on this 
album has a different drum sound. 
All the songs have their own mill , 
as opposed to all of our other 
records. There 's a more homoge-
neous mix going on. 

We want to do some things dif-
ferently, and not completely repeat 
ourselves. I think that if you li sten 
to all of our records, they kind of -
I wouldn't say mature, but evolve 
and don' t repeat thcmselves. 
Do you ever ~onn your 
lon& experimental 50n&5

No. Are you talking about the

Yes. Don't you think your

into your instrumental 
songs? 

Ycah, I guess. But we would-
n't rea lly be able to do thaI. For 
one thing. that song is a con-
glomeration of differcnt songs 
off the record. We sampled Sara's 
drum heats and stu ff like thaI. 
Do you take a sampler 
with you on tour? 

No. We've talked about buy-
ing a sampler, but I don't know 
if we'd bring it with us on tour. 
We're actually starting our own 
studio at home. 
Are there any other side 
projects you're working 
on? 

I have another band, called 
The Replicants, but we ' re not 
very acti ve right now. We just 
came out with a record on a new 
sub-label of Kill Rock Stars. 
Vern has a band called Long 
Hind Legs. and they're also 011 
Kill Rock Stars. Sara doesn't 
really do other stuff. 
What are you pine to 10

After the West Coast tour 
we're going to come home for a 
month. Then we're going to 
tour the U.S., then we're going 
to do Europe, then Japan and 
Australia.

The 
Coach 

Tritons Render Poets Speechless 
Travis Hill 
You Guys Brought 
It Very Strong 

Last qu arter, hitterly 
remarked on the apath y of 
Triton fans. But upon rev iewi ng 
the events of the quarter, I have 
to say that I am impressed with 
what you guys (and extremely 
beautiful girls) accompl ished. 

It takes a big man 10 admit 
when he 's wrong, and an even 
bigger one to ask for forgive-
ness. And if you find him, tell 
him to shut the hell up. I' m not 
at all sorry for what I said . In 
fact, I'm going to take credit. If 
it wasn't for me pestering you 
guys so much, we never would 
have had the most amazing 
UCSD athletic event in recent 
memory - the women's volley-
ball Final Four weekend . 

Yeah, yeah, I know some of 
you are thinking that none of 
that fun stuff would have hap-
pened if it wasn't for the super-
human efforts of our Fall teams, 
and that in no way am I con-
nected to those events. 

That's all well and good, but 
I know that my badgering got 
into some of your heads. Maybe 
it was the dark, mossy side of 
your heads, but nevertheless, the 
voice that told you to go to that 
game was most likely MINE! 

Seriously though, that week-
end was the culminati on of what 
I think will be looked upon as a 
very import ant quarter in the 
history of UCSD sports. While 
it won ' t he looked at as, "The 
quarter that Triton fans got off 
their respective asses," it could 
very well be a turning point. 

There were quite a few inci-
dents that showed me there 
could be better things to come, 
butI'll focus on the big three. 

The first happened very early 
on, but it set a tone. The Greek 
System combined with the 
Athletic Department to put on a 
barbecue before a water polo 
game. There were a ton of peo-
ple out there , and everybody 
was having a great time. 

The next event was the 
NCAA women's soccer Western 
Regionals. The stands were 
overflowing during those 
action-packed nights. I remem-
ber talking to people who were 
upset that they didn ' t go. That 's 
a good sign because people on 
campus arc talking about sports 
like it 's "the" thing to do. 

Then, of course, there was 
the NCAA volleyball National 
Champion hips at RIMAe. That 
was the most unbelievable 
sporting event I've been a part 
of since I've been here. Th ' peo-
ple wh were ther know what 
I'm tal lung about when I sa 
there wa clectri ity in the air. 
You could feci II , it was infec-
tious - kind of like the nu , 
only beller. 

I think things are looking up. 

TOUGH NIGHT: Tritons ba h haples 
Whittier in 103-35 blowout at RIMAe 
By Jeff Bassett 
Guard ian Reporter 

Imagine the Bul b wi tho ut 
Michael Jordan. Better yet, think 
hack to the year he dec ided to play 
hardball instead of roundball. Did 
the Bulls win the c ha mpion ~h ip'! 
Not even close. 

Or consider the case of the 
Dallas Cowboys. Wit h Jimmy 
Johnson, the 'Boys won multiple 
Super Bowls. Without him, their 
new coach ends up bringing guns to 
the airport. The point? Take away a 
team's leader, and things start to 
fa ll apart . That brings us to thi s 
year's UCSD women's basketball 
team. 

For as long as most Tritons can 
remember, Karli lung wirth has 
been an instrumental member of 
the team. However, lungwirth 's 
season has been cut short with her 
untimely departure. 

Not to suggest that lungwi rth 
was the anointed leader of the 
learn , or that in her absence the 
team will fall apart ; but facts are 
facts, and lungwirth was leading 
the team in both scoring and 
rebounding before her departure. 

on I) of 27 attempts from 
downt o~ n. Dd ensively, 
the Tritons' full ·court 
press forced Wh itt ie r to 
w lllmit 44 ILI rnover!> and 
held th t.: Poet ~ to 25 per-
l:ent shooting overall . 

The game began l:om-
petit ively enough as 
1cnessa Bayda's pair of 
lhree·pointers staked the 
Tritons to an 11 -7 lead. 
Any thoughls the Poets 
might have had of hanging 
with UCSD were erased 
aft er the fi rst four minutes, 
as lhe Tritons proceeded to 
go on a 22-3 run . 

The full -court press 
was largely responsible for 
lhe Triton spurt, as the 
quickness in the backcourt 
of Marci Ernsberger, Amy 
McClure, Amy Franzen 
and Tristen Teasdale 
forced the Poets into 
numerous traveling viola-
tions and turnovers. 

Consequently, it was with a fair 
amount of curiosit y that many 
allended Tuesday night's women 's 
basketball game. If its shellacking 
of the Whittier College Poets is 
indicative of the team's response, 
women's basketball at UCS D is 
going to be just fine. 

The freshman tandem 
of Kim eal and 
Genev ieve Ruvald con-
verted the inside opportu-
niti es that the press pro-
vided, propelling the 
Tritons to a 45- 18 halft ime 
lead, leav ing the Poets 
with hanging heads. 

The second half saw 
more of the same, wi th

The Tritons not only cru ised to a 
103-35 point win, their second trip 
past the century mark in the last 
three games, but they completely 
dominated the Poets from start to 
fini sh. 

Offensively, the Tritons execut-
ed both from behind the arc and in 
the painl. The women grabbed 31 
offensive rebounds and converted 

senior Krista Pochler single-hand-
edly brea ki ng down the Poets' 
defense. After two consecuti ve 
baseline drives resulting in two 
buckets, Poehler slipped into the 
key and made a hanging 5-foot 
jumper.

floor resulted in assists fo r Poehler,

Kudirka Wins Again 
TROPHIES: Water polo star Romas Kudirka 
won his second Player of the Year Award 
By Jonah NII.naon 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Who da man? 
For the second consecutive sea-

son, UC San Diego's Romas 
Kudirka has proved that he is, in 
fact, the man. 

Kudirka has been namt:d 
NCAA Division HI Player of the 
Year by the United States Water 
Polo Coaches Association. 

Kudirka, a 6-foot-6 senior from 
La Crescenta, led the Tritons in the 
1997 season to a first-place fini sh 
31{1ong Division TIl teams and an 
11th-place ranking in the NCAA 
Open Division, wh ich incl ucles 
teams from all di visions. 

Kudi rka had 49 goals and a 
.480 shooting percentage whi h 
earned him, in add ition to the 
NCAA Division \U Player of the 
Year Award, the We tern Water 
Polo Association Player of the 
Year Award for the second straight 

season in November. 
loining Kudirka on the 

Division III Water Polo AII -
American First Team were team-
mates Ross Mecham and Adam 
Bollenbach. 

Mecham, a 6-foot-3 sophomore 
from Palo Alto, was the team's 
de.fensive specialist, leading the 
team in steals (77) and a sists (24) 
to go along with hi s 35 goals. His 
77 steal s broke the UCSD school 
record of 75 set by Jason Vance in 
1989. 

Bollenbach, a 6-foot-2 ~en ior 
from Costa Mesa, added much to 
the team 's play, scoring 23 goals 
and recording 15 assi ts and 30 
steal s on the season. 

Head Coach Denny Harper's 
water polo team fini shed the sea-
son with a 13-13 record overall 
with a tough schedule, featuring 
some top-notch Division I oppo-
nents. 

uncont ested layu p and Bayda fo r a 
th ree-poi nter. 

After yet another three from 
Bayda, McClure entered the game 
and promptly sank two more from 
behind the arc. The remainder of 
the half was dominated by Neal, 
who posted a career-high 23 points. 

"No disrespect to Whittier, but 
this game was essentially a tune-up 

for Ottawa," McClure said. "The 
key on nights like tonight is to 
maintain a high level of play, and 
hopefull y that will prepare us for 
future games which will be more 
competitive." 

The important battle against 
Ottawa Uni versity (Kan.) is tonight 
at 7 p.m. at RIMAC Arena. This 
one should be a close one. 

Triton Athletics To Give 
Away $10,000 At Halftime 
FREE MONEY: Win $10 grand at halftime of 
UCSD men's and women's basketball games 
By Jonah NII.nlOn 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

How many of you could use 
$10,000'1 

Well Triton junkies, now you ' ll 
have your chance to earn a little 
extra spending money while wit-
nessing the athletic prowess of the 
UCSD men's and women's basket-
ball teams. 

Courtesy of UCSD Athletics 
and the l ones Soda Co., spectators 
will have an opportunity to win 
$ 10,000 during the halftime festi v-
iti es of this year 's men's and 
women's basketball home games. 

In addition to the usual promo-
tions (pi zza giveaway, three-point 
giveaway and the Islands Halftime 
Shootout), spectators will be able 
to lI ign up as they enter the arena 
to be randomly elected to panici-
pate in the "Jones Soda $10 Grand 
Challenge." 

The participant will have 25 
seconds to make a lay-up, a free 
throw, a three-point shot and a 
half-coun shol. If you can make 
all four shots in the allotted time, 
you will be $10,000 richer! 

It sounds like an unlikely feat 
to accomplish, but let's not forget 
the million-dollar half-court shot 
in the Bulls game a few years 
back. People, it can be done. 

This is all part of the UCSD 
Athletic Department 's aim to get 
students more fired up about 
attending sporting events. 

The first opportunity at the loot 
will be this Fri. , l an. 16 at RIMAC 
Arena when the men's basketball 
team takes on the Panthers of 
Chapman Universi ty at 7 p.m. On 
Saturday, the women's team hosts 
Chapman at the same lime. So, if 
you like money and a little hoops, 
we' ll see you out there,
