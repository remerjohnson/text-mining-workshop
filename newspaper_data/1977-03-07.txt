The Man from UNCLE Lives' 
I nterpol, Student Hassles Probed 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

Interpol. The name even sounds 
ominous. And according to Roger 
Garrison, Assistant Regional 
Director of the National Com-
mission on Law Enforcement and 
Social Justice (UCLE) for San 
Diego and Imperial Counties, the 
International Criminal Police 
Organization more than lives up to 
the "devious" nature of its al>' 
pellations. 

Interpol officials deny the 
allegations that they have been 
operating as an intelligence 
agency, yet the NCIE (organized 
by the Church of Scientology,) has 
linked them to Central 
Intelligence Agency operations. 
They have also been charged with 
extensive harassment of "in-

nocent" individuals, circulation of 
false reports, and failure to ef-
fectively suppress drug traffic, 
skyjacking, counterfeiters and 
forgers. . 

Garrison, in leveling these 
charges, noted that "it's very easy 
for Interpol to set up people on 
false drug charges in domestic and 
foreign countries." He also stated 
one of his main interests at UCSD 
was in talking with students 
because "traditionally young 
people have been the victims of 
Interpol, especially college 
students. " 

Freedom of InformaUon 
The NCLE filed a Freedom of 

Information (FOI) request to the 
CIA for files on Interpol and were 
denied. They proceeded to file suit 
for unlawful withholding, and this 
legal action revealed the truth to 

them about CIA - Interpol con-
nection, CIA attornies submitted a 
legal brief, contradicting their own 
denial of Interpol ties. They 
aUegedly refused to disclose 
certain docwnents because they 
"would reveal that the government 

. had cooperated with Interpol in the 
.collection of intelligence." 

The docwnents, according to the 
report, contain "the means by 
which Interpol collects intelligence 
abroad and describes intelligence 
sources and methods. " 

The NCLE has docwnented five 
cases of Interpol abuse and is 
currently investigating 20 to 30 
other reports. Docwnents have 
been directed to Rep. Edward 
Roybal, chairman of the House 
Subcommittee on Senate 
Appropriations, who has been

Council Reconsiders 
Paramedic Program 

by Joel C. Don 
Associate News Editor 

When a person suffers an arrested heart, or an automobile accident 
victim goes into primary shock, getting aid to the victim in the first five 
minutes is critical. 

Unless fluids are immediately administered to the shock patient or 
electric current applied to an idle heart, death becomes an immin nt 
reality. 

Lifesaving, in our technological society, no longer simply involves the 
transport of accident victims to the emergency room of the community 
hospital. Across the country, cities and counties have initiated a new 
service which, in fact, brings the needed emergency room service to the 
patient. 

The advanced medical service is known as paramedical emergency 
care. 

Up until now, paramedical emergency service has only been available 
in the San Diego and Imperial county areas including San Dieguito, Del 
Mar, Chula Vista, Poway, Or-eanside, Santee, Lakeside and Calexico. 

This is tbe first article in a tw&opart series on paramedical services and 
the City of San Diego. The second part will appear Wednesday, dealIng 
witb other aspects of the paramedic question, and how it can be instltuteil 
in San Diego. 

PropoSition K, a property tax lrutiative, would have brought paramedic 
service to the City of San DiegoA had it not been defeated in the last 
election. The Sari Diego City u>uncil is, however, considering bid 
proposals for a citywide paramedic program. 

If a proposal is accepted by the council, the new paramedics will be 
trained by a program which combines the efforts of San Diego county and 
the University of California (UC). 

The Emergency Medical Services Training Office, located at the 
Kearny Annex of the UC, is part of the San Diego County Otfice of 
Emergency Medical Services. Through federal grants from the National 
Institutes of Health, administered through the University of California, 
and a contract from the County of San Diego, the office has conducted 
paramedic training for the San Diego and Imperial county programs. 

Medical Experts Provide Supervision 
The training frogram is also a part of the Department of 

AnestheSiology 0 the University Hospital and the UCSD School of 
Medicine and uses physicians, nurses and medical experts to provide 
teaching and clinical supervision.

Women Pass Petitions for 
Campus Shuttle Bus Se'rvice 

An effort this week is being initiated by the Rape Task Force to start 
a nighttime shuttle bus service around campus for the spring quarter. 

Citing the poor lighting and the i<extended" and claMerous walking 
distances between buildings around campus. and fit an effort to 
alleviate this situation, the Task Force has ljegun circulating petitions 
around campus in the hopes fi showing student support for the shuttle 
to the administration. 

.. A shuttle service woula De a significant step towards improving the 
safety getting around on campus," said Cathy Hauer of the Task 
Force. "Both women and men find their mobility limited at night by 
the present advene conditiOIL'l. " 

Bowen NGtei UDivenlty "ObUpl." 
Ken Bowers, working out of Business Services, noted the 

"University's ob~ in addressq the concerns of the students 
and their Safety." rs admitted he WII not aware of the student 
demands for the bus shuttle, bat lnIiJted his office "reacts to the 
demands of the students." 

The Talk Force hopes that through the petitiOIll a definite need for 
the nighttime intercampus bus service can be shown. Additionally, the 
Task Force suggests students going and talking to staff members of 
the Buslne. omce on Matthews Campus, Bullcllitg 204. 

"If we can get the s~rt, a ~DOIII can be taken to Geonze 
Murphy, Vlce-cnancellor -01 Student Alf.irs, said Hauer. "Hopefuny 
we could then bnplement the ..... Ule on a trial basis for the spring 
quarter, with the service nDlDing Sunday throuIh Thursday after

Aerosol Spray Ban Proposed in Assembly 
by Hugb Mclntosb 

Staff Correspondent 

A bill banning the manufac-
ture, sale or use of aerosols con-
taining chemicals that are possibly 
harmful to the earth's ozone layer 
was approved by the Assembly 
Committee on Health last week. 

By a vote of six to two, AB 236 
was passed from committee and 
sent to the full Assembly for 
consideration. The bill is sponsored 
by Assemblymember John 
Vasconcellow (D-San Jose). 

"It's an established fact that the 
depletion of the ozone layer causes 
an increase in skin cancer," 
Vasconcellos said." The' ozone 

.. layer is being depleted and 
~ flourocarbons are getting up 
'5. there." 

~ F1ourocarbon Breakdown 
Flourocarbons (c holor-

flourocarbons) are used as a 
propellant in aerosol spray 
products such as perfwne, hair 
spray, deodorants, insecticides 
and cleaning fluids. 

The ozone layer of the earth's 
atmosphere lies at an altitude of 10 
to 15 miles. It protects the earth 
from too much high-energy 
ultraviolet light wtiich may cause 
skin cancer, and have harmful 
effects on plants, animals and the 
climate. 

According to Dr. Odell Raper, a 
research scientist at Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, 
flourocarbons do not readily break 
down and combine with other 
substances. They may drift for as 
long as twenty years until they 
reach the ozone layer. 

Once they reach this layer, the 
flourocarbons are broken down by 
ultraviolet light. They release 
chlorine gas which reacts with the 
ozone so that it no longer protects 
the earth from ultra violet light. 

"U this natural protective ozone 
layer is depleted," Raper said, 
"ultraviolet radiation will 
penetrate to the earth's surface, 
causing skin cancer, impairment 
of photosynthesis In plants and, it 
in large amounts, genetic mutation 
and death." 

According to Vasconcellos' 
figures, the ozone layer was 
depleted by four percent last year. 
It will eventually be decreased by 7 
to 13 percent, he said. 

A one percent depletion of the 
ozone layer will cause a 
corresponding two percent in-
crease in the number of cases of 
skin cancer, he said. A ten percent 
depletion of the ozone layer would 
amount to roughly 600 to 800 new 
cases of skin cancer in California. 

Opponents Say Walt 
Opponents of the bill said the 

Legislature should wait for and 

follow federal guidelines 
regulating the use of flourocarbons 
in aerosols. They said the 
California aerosol industry, which 
employs more than 5,600 persons, 
would be better able to adjust to 
the ban during that time. 

"The question seems to be ho'" 
long do we wait before we act, ' 
Vasconcellos said. "My answer is 
that we've waited too long 
already." 

It will take 15 years for the 
flourocarbons released today to 
affect the atmosphere, Vascon-

KGB's Gelb Not a OJ, 
But an "Air Personality" 

by Sara J. Low~n 

Jeff Gelb, KGB disc jockey, is 
about as far from Wolfman Jack as 
you can get. He doesn't talk jive, he 
has a degree in telecom-
munications and he doesn't like to 
think of himself as a disc jockey. 

"The term Disc Jockey is from 
the 50s-it's outdated. It implies 
someone who just sits and spins 
discs," Gelb said in a recent in-
terview. He thinks the term "air 
personality" is a better discription 
of what he does-try to attract 
listeners with his approach to 
radio. According to Gelb, his al>' 
proach is to talk to listeners as if 
they're intelligent adults, rather 
than trying to be cool. He hasn't 
tried so much to develop a radio 
personality, he said, as to project 
his own personality over the radio. 

Gelb admitted that he does 
exaggerate his personality slightly 
to k~p viewe interested trom 
day to day. "It's liJte the way you 
make your voice deeper than 
normal when you're on the air; you 
make your life sound livelier than 
it is or else people won't be in-
terested,' he said. 

Gelb expre ed his belief that 
disc jockeys influence listeners' 
musical tastes, but said that they 
hav no influ nc over peopl ' 

lifestyles. "I think the day when 
people would try to emulate a disc 
jockey is long gone." 

Nor does Gelb believe that he has 
any sway over 'teenage listeners. 
He called charges that sex rock-
rock songs with suggestive lyrics-
is corrupting teenagers "a load of 
baloney." In fact, Gelb feels that 
mentioning sex in songs may have

Escorts Encourage 

passive Dependence" 
A comment should be made about your article. "A Ugbt In the Dart," 

of March 3. Thia Is a good eumple of what could be called a sexist bias 
evidem in an effort to "belp" wqmen. 

'Ibis Is one of the many problems Inberent in Joe Formusa's escort 
service proposal. It's tbe "sit back,little lady, and I'U take care of you," 
meutality at its fullest Dower. A product Ii an enremely unrealistic way 
of ~, UU service provides what no woman will ever have for the 
rest Ii her Iife-a man to take care of her. 

Tbe fact remains that we have to be able to move around with the 
freedom of men if we are to participate equally in any prolessioaal world. 
Tbere will be no one to bold our bllDdson the wayoutoftbe office at 10:30 
when we're 30, on the way home from the courtroom at 45, or on tbe way 
home from tbe ccmmittee meeting at 72. We bave to be able to do it 
ourselves. 

Herein lies the main problem. The escort senice is like a cough drop 
for cancer. And In some senses it is perpetuating the caneer, becllWle it 
encourages women to give in to depeodeDce, fear and Is, or could be used 

r ..., a substitute for increasing control of the actual rape threat 
I am sure the motivations behind Joe Fol"lJlllS8's ideas are good. He Is 

an activist and should be commended for it And Ilmow my objections are 
rather esoteric for the woman who needs to get hun Revelle to Centrol 
library and is afraid to, here and now. 

My objections will have no validity for a woman who bas been raped, 
and who wishes to God that Joe Formusa bad been there wben she needed 
him. But I wanted to draw attention to another aspect of tbe problem to 
make sure no one bas confused this short-term band-aid with tile real 
solutions to the rape threat 

I know Formusa is not claiming to have solved anything, and I respect 
his ability and desire to do something, anything, for pouible rape vic-
tims. But if I call up the escort service some nigbt, I will realize that if the 
problem were solved, I would not have to call. 

I hope Joe Fonnusa agrees with me. No matter bow much he wants to 
"be held responsible for anything that happens," the facts in the real 
world dictate that he can't be responsible for aU the rapes, all the rapes 
that will occur because there was no sUgbtly sexist Joe Fonnusa (or one 
of his "cbecked-oot" deputies) there to preventit. 

Only a determined coalition of determined men and women can prevent 
those. LORRAINE M. MILLS 

Rape Task Force Recommends 
A Nighttime Intracampus Bus 

Hopefully, there is an awareness 
in our community of the potential 
dangers of traveling on campus at 
night - for both women and men. 

There are many improvements 
that need to be made to change the 
existing problems. Right now there 
is some action being taken - a 
small step towards the eventual 
liberation of campus people from 
the fear of being attacked. 

There are petitions being cir-
culated this week to indicate a need 
for a free nighttime intracampus. 
bus. Show support by signing it and 

talkiNt to the people in the 
Business Office. They are open and 
responsive and are uJtimately 
responsible for the implementation 
of the service. 

There are still many safety 
problems on thIa campus but we 
hope that through the support and 
use of the bus service we will 

con~ the necessary people that 
our other demands for im-
provements on unsafe conditions 
must be met as well.

It is discouraging to discover, 
moreover, that there has been little 
attempt to bring these allegations 
to light or to verif ., their accuracy. 

I 

As long as women live in fear of 
rape they cannot be or function as 
free individuals. 

We would like to suggest that 
reporting a sexual assault not only 
helps to arrest an attacker, but 
also protects other women from 
incurring a similar attack. 

There are service centers on 
campus as well as in the San Diego 
community which provide aid for 
rape victims.

as weU as having available trained 
professionals who will accompany

These support groups are staffed 
by sympathetIc women who have 
as their main concern easing the 
traumas that follow a rape. They 
are trained to help women make 
their own decisions in deciding 
what course of actIon to undertake. 
Their concern is that every in-

International Wopten's Day has 
a long and militant history as a 
celebration of women's strength. 
On March 8, 1908 women gannent

ditions and demanding suffrage. In 
1917, IWD began the Russian 
Revolution when women marched 
to the streets demanding bread and 
better living conditions. 

This year's International 
Women's Day comes at a time 
when women face unprecedented 
attacks. 

The continuing economic crisis 
has thrown women out of jobs 
under the tactic of "first hired, 
first fired. " 

Abortion rights are slipping

Potiol1lI1akers 
By Ran Anbar 

"I have here a potion that will allow you to live forever," said the 
potlonmaker. 

"That is indeed astounding, "responded the YOWlg man. "But it is 
surely beyond my capacity to buy it." 

"Ob but no," said the potionmaker. "You may have it for free right 
here and now If you promise to drink it before my eyes presently. " 

"I am not sure," said the young man, frowning. "It is a hard decision. 
TeUme, would you know if there is life after death?" 

:'Why yes I do," replied the potionrnaker gesturing toward a for-
nudable looking book. "I have detennioed that there is definitely no life 
after death. Would you like that I show you my proof?" 

"Oh no," ~d the h?"est young man. "Anyone with the capabilities of 
~anufa~unng a potIon .of endless life will surely not lie about his 
dIscoverIes. But tell me, If I do take this potion W9uld I ever be able to 
die?" 

"No. It wiUp~tect you from all harm," said the old potionrnaker. 
::But ~hat galOs have you to make in giving me this potion for free?" 

Not.hmg, my son, but the knowledge that at least one person has taken 
my potIOn." 

"But why haven't people taken it?" 
"I should not tell you this, for you will not wantto take of the potion, but 

I m~t ~s I am an hon~t man. The reason is quite simple. Life is just too 
long if It lasts an etermty. And then you have nothing to do with yourself 
for the rest of time." 

::Is that why y?U haven't taken it?" asked the young man. 
I~deed that IS so. If I were to take the potion what more could I do? 
oth~g at ~l- as I.would have already discovered what I set as my goal, 
~ ootJon of everlastmg life. Ironically, I do not even dare to try it to see if 
ltiVorks. " 

"I think I see your predicament," said the honest young man "But I 
(ear that I should not be able to help you with it." ' 

"You have made a wise choice, my son. And pray you remember to 
always ask before you partake." . 

"That, I will," promised the man, older than he was before he entered 
the shop. "Good-bye." 

••• 

"Does a potion of everlasting life exist?" asked the young lady who 
entered the shop. 

:?ndeed it does and I do have it," answered the potiorunaker. 
And do teU me, for I hear you are very wise " continued the lady "is 

there life after death?" • ' , 
"~ have looked at that question long and bani " replied the good po~onma~r. "And I have reached no conclusion ex~ for tI)e one that it 

IS ~slble to reach a conclusion regarding your question. " 
011, that is unfortunate!" exclaimed the lady. "It makes it so 

dreadfuUy bard for me to decide whether or not t<ttake the potion What 
do you think I should do?" . 

"I'm afraid it is up to you ma'am." 
"Ohdear,ohdear. What shall I do?" 
"Do you wish to live forever?" 
"011 yes, oh yes. There are so many things I want to do. It would simply 

be marvelous." 
"But what if there is a heaven? Would you not be missing your chance 

there if you do live forever on tbls earth?" 
"That Is my problem exactiy, sir!" said the young lady excitedly. "So 
w~tshouldldo?" 

"It is a gamble," answered the old potiorunaker. "I cannot settbe odds 
for you - and even if I could, I do not think it would help. It is up to you. " 

"011, could I come back tomorrow?" 
"You may, but I may no longer be here, for I am very old and close to 

my death." 
II And you haven't taken of your potion?" 

. " No, for I have lived enough in this life and I have decided that I should 
li1i:e to take a chance. I would not be gambling much, save an old man's 
body."

Passive Dependence 
A comment should be made about your article. "A Ligbt In the Dart," 

of MardI 3. 1bia Is a good example ci wbat could be called a 8eKist bias 
evidemln an effort to "help" wqmen. 

'lbis Is one oi the many problema Inberent In Joe Formuaa's eacort 
service propoeal. It's the "sit back, UtUe lady, and I'll take care of you," 
mentality at its fullest flower. A product ci an eztremely unreaUsUc way 
of thinking, tbi.s service provides what no woman will ever have for the 
rest oi her life. man to take care of her. 

The fact remains that we have to be able to move around with the 
freedom of men if we are to participate equally In any professional world. 
There will be no one to hold our bands on the wayoutoftbecifice aUO:30 
when we're 30, on the way heme from the courtroom at 45, or on the way 
home from the committee ~ at 72. We .. ve to be able to do it 
ourselves. 

Herein lies the main problem. 1be escort aervice is lite a cough drop 
for cancer. Anclln some senses it Is perpetuating the cancer, because il 
encourages women to give in to depeDdence, fear and is, or could be UIII!d 

• _ a substitute for increasing control of the actual rape threat 
I am sure the motivations behind Joe Form ... 's ideas are good. He Is 

an activist and should be commended for it And limo. my objections are 
rather esoteric for the woman who needs to get from Revelle to Centrol 
Ubrary and is afraid to, here and now. 

My objections will have no validity for a woman who bas been raped, 
and who wishes to God that Joe Fomwsa lad been there when she needed 
him. But I wanted to draw attention to another aspect oi the problem to 
make sure no one has confused this short-term band-aid with tile real 
solutions to the rape threat 

I know Formosa Is not claiming to have solved anything, and I respect 
his ability and desire to do something, anything, for posaible rape vic-
tims. But if I call up the escort service some night, I will realize tbat if the 
prob!em were solved, I would not bave to call. 

I hope Joe Formusa agrees with me. No matter how much be wants to 
"be held responsible for anything that happens," the facts in the real 
world dictate that he can't be responsible for an the rapes, all the rapes 
that will occur because there was no slightly sexist Joe Formusa (or one 
afhls "cbecked-out" deputies) tberetopreventit. 

Only a determined coalition of determined men and women can prevent 
those. LORRAINE M. MD..I.S 

Rape Task Force Recommends 
A Nighttime Intracampus Bus 

Hopefully, there Is an awareness 
in our community of the potential 
dangers of traveling on campus at 
night - for both women and men. 

There are many improvements 
that need to be made to change the 
existing problems. Right now there 
is some action being taken - a 
small step towards the eventual 
liberation of campus people from 
the fear af being attacked. 

There are petitions being cir-
culated this week to indicate a need 
for a free nighttime intracampus 
bus. Show support by signing it and 

talki.nJ{ to the people in the 
Business Office. They are open and 
responsive and are Ultimately 
resporL'Iible for the implementation 
of the service. 

'There are still many safety 
problems on this campus but we 
rope that through the support and 
use of the bus service we wiD 
convlnt'i! the necessary people that 
our other demands for im-
provements on unsafe conditions 
must be met as well.

Commentary 
Apathy is Positive Action 

performing a positive action. This 
is possible upon your recognition ' 
that you have chosen to act 
apathetically. ADd once .. you haye 
chosen to act apathetically, apaUly 
becomes manifested as positive 
action. 

by Bert Lee 
The student activist movement 

of the 19608 is over. We are in the 
1970s, and being so, are embarked 
on a student activist movement oi 
new dimensions and charac-
teristics. 
Bert Lee Is a Revelle Political 
Science major. 

Frequent mention is made of the 
pervasive pall of "apathy" 
surrounding students in their 
political endeavors. students who 
do "get involved" disapprove of 
the lethargy of their peers and ' 
blame them for the absense oi 
relevant quantifiable "student 
power." 

Students not as politically 
"active" blame the inherent 
educational structure which 
mitigates and dissipates any en-
deavors for change. Everyone 

knows you can't beat the system, 
they say. 

Finany, "the administration" 
blames the students for lack ci 
Initiative and participation: They 
continually reiterate that the 
system i.'1 open and receptive to 
change but students simply don't 
care enough. 

Well. what exactly is apathy? 
according to Weblters Seve'" 
New Collegiate Dldlollllry, apathy 
is defined as: impassiveness or 
indifference. It is importam to 
notice that this defmition makes no 
reference to inactivity. Indeed, by 
choosing to address a situation 
apathetically, you as a student are 

You see, it is so easy. Once you

(IWD) Committee at UCSD,

the living conditions of third world 
women who must work in the home 
as well as the factory. 

It has come to our attention that 
there have . been several 
allegations af sexual assaults on 
this campus. This issue is of great 
concern to all women since we all 
must cope with the fear of being 
raped as we travel around campus. 
campus. 

It is discouraging to discover, 
moreover, that there has been little 
attempt to bring these allegations 
to light or to veril'y their accuracy. 

As long as women live in fear of 
rape they cannot be or function as 
free individuals. 

We would like to suggest that 
reporting a sexual assault not only 
helps to arrest an attacker, but 
also protects other women from 
incurring a similar attack . 

There are service centers on 
campus as well as in the San Diego 
corrununity which provide aid for 
rape victims.

professionals who will accompany 
women to the hospital and to court. 
These support groups are staffed 
by sympathetic women who have 
as their main concern easing the 
traumas that follow a rape. They 
are trained to help women make 
their own decisions in deciding 
what course of action to undertake. 
Their concern is that every in.

The march will begin at 11: 15 at 
three points on campus: 1) Third 
College snack-bar, 2) Matthews 
cafeteria and 3) Tioga and Tenaya 
Halls . Women will begin gathering 
at these locations at 11: 15, where a 
woman from the IWD committee 
will direct the route of the march. 
Once peoole have organized at a 
location, we will march to Revelle 
Plaza. . 

A women's concert will begin at 
11 :30. After the concert, two guest 
speakers will focus on the issues of 
forced sterilization and the Manzo 
defense. 

. The Manzo case concerns four 
women social workers who were 
allegedly charged with tran-
sporting and abetting "illegal" 
aliens, when they were simply 
carrying out their responsibilities 
as counselors for SpanislHpeaking 
people In Tuscon. The trial oi these 
women will begin, Ironically, on 
March 8. We need to show support 
for the four women whose cue sets 
a precedence for arbitrary 
harassment of any social service 
organizations by the federal 
government.

International Women's Day has 
a long and militant history as a 
celebration of women's strength. 
On March 8, 1908 women garment 
workers marched throlJf(h New 
York protesting sweatshop con-
ditions and demanding suffrage. In 
1917, IWD began the Russian 
Revolution when women marched 
to the streets demanding bread and 
better living conditions. 

This year's International 
Women's Day comes at a time 
when women face unprecedented 
attacks. 

The continuing economic crisis 
has thrown women out of jo~ 
under the tactic of "first hired, 
first fired. " 

Abortion rights are slipping 
through our fingers, as wen as 
adequate daycare facilities and 
working benefit.. 

Many of the gains which were 
won through struggle over the 
years have been wiped out. 

IWD Is a tbne to voice our 
outrage and demand our rights 

IWD Is also a day of celebration 
and an opportunity to show OlD' 
soUdarity. The women from the 
'IWD Committee encourage the 
support and participation oi all 
UCSD women on March 8.

"That is indeed astounding,"responded the young man. "But it is 
surely beyond my capacity to buy it." 

"Ob but DO," said the potionmaker. "You may have it for free right 
here and now if you promise to drink it before my eyes presently" 

" I am not sure," said the young man, frowning. "It is a hard' decision 
Tell me, would you know if there is life after death?" . 

~'Why yes 1 do," replied the potionmaker gesturing toward a for-
rrudable looking book. "I have detennined that there is definitely no life 
after death. Would you like that I show you my proof?" 

"Oh no," ~d the h?Rest young man. "Anyone with the capabilities of 
~anufa~unng a potion .of endless life will surely not lie about his 
discoveries. But tell me, if I do take this potion would I ever be able to 
die?" 

::No. It will 'p~otectyou from all hann, " said the old potionmaker. 
"But ~hat gams have you to make in giving me this potion for free?" 

Not~llng , my son, but the knowledge that at least one person has taken 
my potIOn ." 

"But why haven't people takenit?" 
" I should not tell you this, for you will not want to take of the potion but 

I mW?t ~s I am an hon~t man. The reason is quite simple. tife is just too 
long if It lasts an eternity. And then you have nothing to do with yourself 
for the rest of time ... 

::Is that why y~u haven't taken it?" asked the young man. 
I~deed that IS so. If I were to take the potion what more could I do? 
No~ng at ~ - as 1 would have already discovered what I set as my goal ~ootlon of everlasting life. Ironically, I do not even dare to try it to see If 
ItNorks." 

"I think I see your predicament," said the honest young man "But I 
fear that I should not be able to help you with it." ' 

"You have made a wise choice, my son. And pray you remember to 
always ask before you partake." . 

"That, I will," promised the man, older than he was before he entered 
the shop. " Good-bye."

" Does a potion of everlasting life exist?" asked the young lady who 
entered the shop. 

::Indeed it does and I do have it," answered the potionmaker. 
And do tell me, for I hear you are very wise " continued the lady "Is 

there life after death?" • ' , 
H! have ~ed at that question long and hard," replied the good 
po~onmaker. And I have reached no conclusion except for the one that It 
IS ~possible to reach a conclusion regarding your question." · 

Oh, that Is unfortunate!" exclaimed the lady. "It makes it so 
dreadfully hard for me to decide whether or not to-take the potion What 
do you think I should do?" . 

"I'm afraid It is up to you ma'am." 
"Ohdear,ohdear. What shall I do? " 
"Do you wish to live forever?" 
HOb yes, oh yes. There are so many things I want to do. It would simply 

be marvelo~." 
HB~t what If there Is a heaven? Would you not be missing your chance 
t~re if you do live forever on this earth?" 

'That is my problem exactly, sir!" said the young lady excitedly "So 
wh\itshould 1 do?" . 

" It Is a gamble," answered the old potlonmaker. "I cannot set the odds 
fo~, you - and even if I could, I do not think it would help. It is up to you." 

Oh, could I come back tomorrow"" 
" You may, but I may no longer ~ here, for I am very old and close to 

my death." • 
"And you haven't taken of your potion "" 

. " No, for I have lived enough In this lif~ and I have decided that I should 
like to take a chance. I would not be gambling much, save an old man's

'~ our 5000 Years Are Up" 
F~minist Spirit Ignited 

by Debbie Sebwartz 
StaffWrHer 

Had the time been the late 17th 
century and the place been Salem, 
Massachusetts, there would have 
been quite a few arrests made at 
the Mandeville Gallery last 
Tuesday night. The charge? 
Witchcraft ! 

No spells were cast, nor potions 
brewed, but rituals were per-
formed and spirits rose to make 
the opening of an exhibit by New 
York artist Mary Beth Edelson. 
Edelson ,is a member of the 
feminist cooperative A.I.R. and 
works with the " Heresies" 
magazine collective, both based In 
New York. Her works, which 
represent both spiritual and 
political feminist Ideology, have 
been exhibited In galleries in the 

" East and Midwest. She is making 
her West Coast debut with tbis 
exhibit at UCSD, titled "Your 5,000 
Years Are Up." 

Tne ritual began with a small 
group of women dressed in black 
sitting in the center of a ring of 
flames. "Spirit of our anei.ent 
sisters join us now" was passed 
with a firm handshake from 
woman to woman inside the ring 
and then throughout the audience. 
Chants and mournful cries filled 
the gallery 'as seven large black 
ghostlike figures, formerly a 
sculpture across one wall, came to 
life and glided about the room. The 
chants rose in intensity through 
"Rage," to "TheGoodess is Here," 
and finally "The Goddess is Us." 
The circle of flames indicated the 
burning energy of the united 
feminist · spirit. The energy burst 
forth as the women broke into 
dance, bringing men and women 
from the audience with them. 
Hands joined together in joyous 
celebration - strength! 

Apathy ....

and is manifested by definition. 
Once you as student are able to 

transform your perspective to 
realize the influence you actually 
have over your life, manifested 
positive action becomes a downhill 
endeavor instead of a Sisyphean 
struggle. 

It's about time for a Student 
Enlightenment. Choose and take 
the responsibility of your 
capacities as students. Par-
ticipate. 

Ede1llon says of her work, "I am 
interested in exploring symbOls 
... incorporating Interaction bet-
ween myself and people with my 
art, tapping the collective un-
conscious, as well as conscioUs 
creative energies ..... 

" Your 5,000 Years Are Up" 

announces the deatto of the 
patriarchy and birth of effective 
female power in the world. Photo-
drawings of Edelson's rituals will

achieving those ideals? What are 
the new challenges to those ideals?

. dination of aU emergency medical service education including 
lifeguards, police and fire dei)l'tment persoMel and ambulance at-
tendants. The paramedic train program, however, Is under the total-
control of the Kearny AMes faclli . 

Walraven, whose background lncludes nursing and seven years ex 
perience in paramedic systems, commends the joint operation between 
the county and UC noting that "It's ' one of the most cooperative 

arra~ements" she's ever seen. She insists that the city must take the 
initiatIve on the question of paramedic service. 

"The city should be involved in the paramedic program," Walraven 
said, adding that "they should have been involved a long time ago." 

., As soon as the city makes the decision that they want paramedics, the 
details will be easily worked out," she said. . 

Walraven noted that the ci.ty Ia currently reviewing proposals and 
asserted that she doubts the city wt1l accept any proposal until they have 
accepted the "concept" of paramedic servlce. 

In reference to the pai'amed1c service attached to Proposition K, 
Walraven insisted that the people "didn't know whaUhey were votiilg on, 
what it meant and didn't want it part of property tax." 

Not AJa "Aecarate TeU" 
"'!bere were surveys made before and after the proposition showing 

that more than B5 percent of the pubUc wanted paramedics ud were 
willing to pay for it," Walraven said, adding that the election "didn't 
accurately test their desires at all." 

One major stipulation Walraven places on any paramedic service 
adopted by the city is that it should be a "coordinated system withtn the 
city." She added "the key to the whole thing is that it has to be a system 
and everybody has to be working together." 

training in the program involves five months of intensive classroom 
and paramedic internship experience, said paramedic training instructor 
Ginger Murphy, explaining that the program begins with two months of 
"didactic" or classroom instruction at the training facility located in 
Kearny Mesa . 

The second period of "clinical" training involves one month of hospital 
work where the paramedic students learn such emergency skills as 
giving injections, administering IVs and an orientation to the base station 
hospital. 

The last two months is the actual field internship, where the paramedic 
candidate assists two certified paramedics ' on emergency calls. The 
entire program conslats of approximately 950 hours of training, Murphy 
said.

Under the recently revamped 
programming at KGB, Gelb and 
the other disc jockeys pre-record 
their between-songs patter and 
spend the extra time doing in-
terviews for one-minute features 
on their shows. Gelb described the 
features as vignettes about In-
teresting San Diegans and said 
doing them has put him in better 
touch with what's going on around 
town. He Is enthusiastic about the 
new arrangement because he 
thinks the features provide an 
interesting break between songs. 

As much as he enjoys his job, 
Gelb said he would be shortsighted 
to make being a disc Jockey his 
ultimate career goal. He likes the 
glamour of broadcasting, but he 
feels that any dIac jockey Ia 'played 
out' after 10 years; Gelb has 
worked professionally for 6 years. 
Ilh at KGB. Career possibilities for 
Gelb include being a music 

• director, station manager, a 
concert or record promoter. 
Whatever he does, he said, it will 
be in the entertainment field. 

But for the present, being on thJ 
air is what Gelb likes doing. But 
Jeff Gelb, 70s disc jockey, has one 
complaint about his job: " People 
ought to ' give us more credit. 
There's a lot more to this job than 
spinning discs. "

Early Outreach PartnershJp Plan 
More Minority Students Aim of Progra#m 

by Jady W.ltaD 
SIaH Writer 

If you happen to spy a strange 
entourage of. young visitors this 
month who look more like junior 
high schoolers than prospective 

Cl1ato Benitez 

studerts, rest assured: they really 
are junior high school students. 

What has made it possible for 
these youngsters to scout out a 
future college possibility is a new 
program instituted last November, 
call the Early Outreach Part-
nership Program. The Partnership 
Program is a cooperative effort of. 
the University of california and a 
number of california intermediate 
(or jWlior high) schools designed to 
Increase, over a period of time, the 
number of minority and low 
Income (or economically disad-

.. vantaged ) students achieving 
~ eligibility (or regular admissions 

~ to coUege , specifically to the UC 
iii system. 

<:; 
~ Chato Benitez is the local 
1= coordinator of this joint effort, 

working from his office in EOP. 
"What we attempt to do," says 
Benitez, " is to motivate the 
students who do not traditionally 
achieve eligibility in coming to 
UCSD, or any college for that 
matter. We inform the students of 
University opportunities, explain

County Sheriff) but weren't able to

fi~ation witl} the DA's office." 
On Wednesday, March 9, at 

five, Filgo will be holding an in-
troductory meeting, along with two 
members of Miller's staff, in the 
North conference room of the 
Student Center. FUga urged any 
students interested in being on the 
board to attend the Wednesday 
meeting. 

admissions requirements, and 
counsel students on appropriate 
courses of study which wU1 ensure 
eligibility. " 

Working through the counselors 
at each junior high, Benitez and his 
seven student aldes from UCSD . 
attempt to reach the minority and 
low income students, the primary 
targets of the Program. In 
reaching over 15000 students, 
Benitez and his aides pass out 
literature at the schools, show 
films, provide posters, and give 
individual counseling about post-
secondary opportunities. Benitez 
noted that, " Although past 
programs have usually can-
centrate~ on high school ~udents, 
we realized that prepanng for 
college is somthing that starts 
back in junior high, especially in 
the math 'and science sequences. 
By the time some of these students 
get to high school it may already be 
to late." 

The Partnership Program also 
extends many of its services to 
parents. Currently, brochures are 
being mailed to the parents of all 
students in the program, giving 
parents ideas at entrance 
requirments and available 
scholarships . 

According to one of Benitez' 
helpers, Tony Torres, "a lot of the 
difficulty begins in the homes. 
Many students feel alienated and 
their parents don't have the in-
formation or knowledge to direct 
thier sons or daughters in 
preparing for college." Torres 
went on to say, "I've learned a lot 
myself from working on this 
project. There's a lot of really good 
interaction between junior high 
school students and a student like 
myself, beca~ I've gone the 
same route."

PART A -- UNDERGRADUATE ~STUDENT GOVERNANCE 
CRITEOtIA: 

Tbe follow~ng forms of undergraduate student governance are presented for con-
sideration by all registered undergraduate students. The Elections Board haa 
stipulated and the Chancellor has agreed that at least 25' (or 1,931) of the regis-
tered winter quarter undergraduate students must cast validated ballots in Part ·A 
of this referendum for the results of Part A to be recognized as conclusive. 

In order for one of the three governance forms to become th& afficial form of 
undergraduate student governance, that form must receive at least 50$ plus one vote 
of the validated votes cast in Part A-I. ·In the ev&nt nQ one gove~ance form re-
ceives 5~ plus one vote of the validated votes cast in Part A-I, the runoff pro-
cedure described in Part A-2 will determine the official form of undergraduate 
student governan~e. 

PART A-I 

VarlNG INSTRUCTIONS: 

an 
as 

Each governance form is listed in an order det~rm1ned by chance. Please mark 
"X" in the bOl( beside the governance form you prefer. Vote ·for one form only 
voting for more than one will invalidate Part 'A-l of your ballot.

PART A-2 

VOTING INSTRUCTIONS: 
In the event one of the governance forms does not receive 50$ plus one vote of 

the validated votes cast in Part A-I above, you are asked to state your preference 
given the following three "pair-:-wisE!t choices. Please note that your vote on !.!E! 
of the following three "pair-wise" choices is essential if Part A-I does not 
establish the official form of undergraduate student governance. 

In each of the following three pairs, vote for one form only. Voting for more 
than one~rm in any of the three pairs will invalidate Part A-2 of your ballot. 
Please mark an "X" in the box under the form you pr~fer.

SPECIAL NarE : In the event one of the forms does not receive 50% plus 1 vote of 
the validated votes cast in Part A-I, the two forms receiving the most validated 
votes in that part will "run off" against each other. To avoid another referendum, 
the validated votes cast in one of the pair-wise choices in Part A-2 will be used. 
That pair-wis'e choice will be the one which compares the two forms receiving the 
most validated votes in Part A-I. The winner of this pair-wise choice will be the 
official form of undergraduate student governance at UCSD.

play/skill/expression that is so 
visibly potent and exciting that 
hierarchies develop according to 
individuals' command and 
delivery of the act; because of all 
of this there is one player on every 
volleyball team and in every area 
who eventually acquires a very 

s~cific Reputation. 
The Reputation has nothing to do 

with looks or love life or length of 
lasagna normally eaten for lunch, 
although such attributes can 
become a part of the distinction. 
What's important is that this 
player can do one thing better than 
the athletes he competes with, both 
teammates and opponents alike. 
He has to have the ability to hit a 
volleyball over the net with such 
power and vel9City, with such 
mass-times-acceleration-«luals-
force, that anyone watching jumps 
out of the way and does the old 
Wowee Jaw Drop. 

The Reputation belongs to The

sound is like something you would

• ••• 
Melese does not have that 

overgrown blonde look common to 
so many California volleyball 
hitters. But he makes op for it with 
a pogo stick jump, dispropor-
tionately long arms, and a newly 
sprouted beard. And, of course, a 
right-hand punch that could knock 
the hind legs off of an elephant. 

Friday was not one of Melese's 
better evenings, that happens. 
Good spiking does not come easy. 
Sets have to be just right. Timing is 
crucial. Defenders are always 
there to contend with. A spike is 
one of those explosive actions in 
sports that is executed while the 
entire body is totally exerted for a 
brief instant. Directed paroxysm is 
such a difficult ideal.

During the match too many of 

Melese's spikes either went wide, 
or into the net, were blocked, or 
just weren't hit with all the extras. 
But CSCH was not much com-
petition for UCSD and it turned out 
that no one on the visitors had 
much more than a mediocre mush 
spike. The Tritons took the match 
in four games. 

Melese smiled throughout the 
contest. He usually does. Habit. 
And he did connect on enough good 
spikes. Enough to keep the 
Reputation intact,

Dear Doc: Can you tell me If 

there are any good rock statio ... 
bere In San Diego on the AM .. ad. 
You see, I oaly have AM In my car 
and have to pat up with tbJs pop 
and disco mOlt AM statioas pump 
out now. But my heart lies In real 
rock, ego Supertramp, AerosmJtb, 

. Electric Ught Orchestra, and 
othen of a slmDar kind, including 
Geneses. So Is there any place on 
the AM dJal where I can hear 
music of such excellence, co. 
slstently? - Frustrated 

Apparently you are not aware 
that AM stands for Awful Music. 
The solution to yoour problem is 
simple-buy an in-dash cassette 
player. (Thanks to LM for that 
snappy answer.) Any real rock 
enthusiast would buy one to make 
sure that he or she could "hear 
music of such excellence, con-
sistently." 

Dear Doc: What happened to the 
tickets for the Kenny Loggins 
concert? You said be was coming 
to UCSD In Aprll. Is the concert 
800 on? 

Tickets will be going on sale one 
week from today. You had better 
buy your tickets early the concert 
is sure to sell out. Rumor has it that 
if the concert sells out early 
enough, a second show will be 
added. 

Dear Doc: What does SAT stand 
for? [Otber than Scbolastic 
Aptitude Test.] I beard it men-

SAT is the acronym for 
Systematic Assertiveness 
Training, a technique for self-
development and fulfillment. 
Assertiveness is a set of skills with 
which you can achieve desired 
goals, cope with crltisism, cope 
with negative and positive 
manipulation by others and learn 
to control unwanted emotional 
reactions to stress situations. 
Probably the best description of 
the assertive philosophy is the 
"Bill of Assertive Human Rights" 
which I have taken from WIleD 
I Say No, J Feel GoDty, by Manual 
J.Smith: 
You have the right-

40 judge your own behavior, 
thoughts and emotions, and to take 
responsibility for their initiation 
and consequences upon your self. 
-to offer no reasons or excuses for 
justifying your behavior. 
-to judge if you are responsible for 
finding solutions to other people's 
problems. 
-to change your mind. 
-to be independent of the goodwill 
of others before coping with them. 
-to be illogical in making 
decisions. 
-to say " I don't understand." 
-to say "I don't know. " 
-to say "I don't care. " 
-to make mistakes .... 
and be responsible for them. 

Dear Doc: Whatever happeaed 
to Tesas StrIng Ties? Also, how 
many AlbaDlao-Amerlcans are 
there at UCSD. Thanks. 

I was in San Antonio, Texas just 
last month and found plenty of the 
natives wearing the string ties. I 
guess they haven't heard the string 
ties went out with the nehru 
jackets. They are simply not part 
of that nebulous creature "the 
'current fashion." The look today 
appears to the open collar with 
pendants or chains. Texas String 
Ties just don't fit in. As to your 
second question, the answer is 
191,2. You're welcome. 

Dear Doc: I am a freshman bere 
at UCSD and have come across a 
common problem. Often times 1 
have questioDS concerning dif-
ferent aspects and opportunities 
tbe campus has, but each time I 
walk into an office for infonnatioD, 
I feel like I am interrupting tbe 
secretaries. Usually they are 
eating or gabbing with their co-
workers. I always get a stare and a 
cold " May I help you?" I hate 
feeling like an intruder. Can't they 
at least try to make us feel 

....... I.III.IIS 

weIeo .. aM ..., to Ulftr aD .. 
oarqa .................... 
feel that we have to IIIIrry .. they 
CD pt baek to eatlq or talkIN? 
SIped, Co.r.ed. 

I don't have time to be bothered 
with your problems; I have to get 
back to my lunch. Sounds familar, 
you say'? You are obviously suf-
fering from a common paranoia 
caused by a few secretaries who 
still believe that this campus would 
be a nice place if only there weren't 
any undergraduates. Many 
secretaries relate very well to 
students and genuinely try to 
be of help. As to the others, well, 
you've met them already. Until 
students like you are willing to 
voice your complaints about those 
particular individuals that are 
giving you a hard time, their 
supervisors will problably never 
bear about the problem and those 
secretaries will go right on making 
you feel uncomfortable. To state it 
simply, so you'll understand it, 
name names. Send them in to me, 
if you like, and I'll make sure the 
complaint is heard. If any of the 
secretaries are especially helpful, 
let me know that too. 

Dear Doc; What Is the lowdown 
[get down?] OD Bed Buddles here 
at school! Talking to my youager 
brother, who Uves at Fourth, I 
couldn't beUeve him wben he told 
me about It and even less when be 
said he didn't siga up. Is It possible 
for off-campus students or older 
brothers to join In tbls program? 

Having a Bed Buddy is like 
having secret friend-you don't 
know who's bed buddy you are, and 
your bed buddy doesn't know who 

you are. Although it sounds like a 
French parlor game, it's usually 
done between dorms or residence 
hall floors . Off-campus students 
should urge their college com-
muter boards to take some names 
and let you in on the fun. 
Remember, he who foos and runs 
away, lives to foo another day. DR.

Otber 
Mell10rabilia 

by ~181l Russell 
It's a political week, so I've opted for a political column, knowing all 

you are awaiting the upcoming UCSD student government referendum 
with bated breath. 

Yes, and eacti and every one of you knows why. It's not that we care 
whether there's a legal coup of the Coop. It's not that we wish to write in 
enlightened despotism as the fonn of government we'd prefer. 

No. 
What we, the intelligentsia want, what we, the intellectuals clamor for, 

what we, the nurds are all rallying behind, is question nwnber four under 
Section VII, "Autonomy of the University/Social Responsibility," in the 
Voter's Information Booklet. 

Go . ahead! look for yourself, search through the jumble of the 37 
questions, SIft through that pUe of superfluous verbiage (some have 
called it other things) and get to the meat of the matter - the thrust of the 
entire election. Read with me its words: Should San Diego City and 
County police agencies be barred from patroling university campuses by 
the authority of the Board of Regents? 

Obviously, yes. 
Hot diggity dog. What we are requesting, my friends, is a POLrrlCAL 
~V~. . 

You see, U~D has this reputation. Yeah, forget all the jazz about its 
being a top notch school. Look past the baloney of our being the up and 
coming Harvard of the west coast. Face it, our reputation says we're 
boring. That's BORING. . 

Even the hard core UCSD chauvinists (stand up and be counted Tom 
Tanana and the black and white seotted dog that's always wading in.the 
Revelle fountain) must acknowledge this fact. Who is there that can say 
the word " UCSD" without stifling a yawn? If you can, are you sure you're 
allve·t At any rate, we have the chance of changing all ofthis. 

I mean, the greatest excitement of the year is usually generated when 
Holy Hubert preaches on the Revelle quad. H~ie's a character - we 
enjoy him. Now, imagine a hundred characters, a thousand, a ... 

Picture this scene if you will: a group of robbers planning a heist on one 
of Eddie Albert's San Diego Imperial Savings. "Now, here's the plan, 
boys. Ya see, we grab all da loot in the joint and then take off for UCSO. 
After we make it through dem gates the coppers can't do nothing. We'd 
lay low for awhile in that oasis of eucalyptus, spending the money at the 
Ice Cream Hustler and on Muir coeds." 

Wow. Shades of exotica. Reprobates of all colors and forms floating and 
flocking around our hallowed balls. Fun in the sun,notshadesover grades. 
History books will tell the tale . In the twentieth century first there was 
Argentina to flee to if you were hot, then Algeria, then U~D. 

And even we, the students, could have fun . It's all well and good to be an 
escaped hardened criminal, insane person, or revolutionary, but then we 
could enjoy the situation from the perspectives as students. Let's say 
you're speeding down Torrey Pines and a cop turns on his lights to pull 
you over. Are you going to stop? HElL NO! You're going to bum rubber 
and scream "Up yours, Fascist," until you reach the amnesty of Revelle 
parking lot. 

Sounds good, huh? 
With all the deviants running around, every day would be an " Anything 

Goes" occasion. Most importantly, U~D would no longer be a BORING 
school. 

Of course, there would be several drawbacks, but then, what proposal 
is perfect? The revolutionaries would have to continually blow up 
buildings and take over offices so as not to get out of practice. And the 
robbers and riff raf~ would naturally take their toll each day. 

Additionally, entering and leaving school might be a wee bit difficult. 
You've got to figure the county of San Diego would quarantine the 
campus off like a DNA experimentation room. For a conunuter Student 
to get to a one pm class he'd have to leave at six am. 

And getting out, ah, it'd be like B9gie's Casablanca. A student iden-
tification card would be worth its weight in Reg Fee checks. Naturally, 
the average student should expect to be mugged at least once a quarter, 
and then, upon leaving the campus, be arrested for not having any 
suitable identification, thus ending up spending several days in the pokey. 

All of this for a truly rounded education. 
Put it . this way, after the proposal has been instituted, when you 

mention to people that you're from UCSD, they'll no longer automatically 
look for your calculator. A stiletto maybe, a calculator never. 

The Harvard of the west - fooooooUllUeeeee. Ladies and gents, I ask 
you, I urge you, yes on four, and Casablanca U~D style here we come. 

Potion ma kers .... 
Continaed from Page 3 

The old man ran into the store. "I hear you have a potion of everlasting 
life!" he demanded. 

" Indeed I ~o," replied the potionmaker. "In fact, you may have itfor 
free if you wish. " 

" I'll take it!" 
"But let's not be hasty now," said the good one. "Have you considered 

all the ramifications of living forever?" 
" Indeed I have," replied the old man, clutching his flsts. 
"But did you know that there is a life after death?" 
"I did." 
" It is a heaven," said the potionmaker. "I have proven it In my book 

over there on the shelf. Would you like me to show it to you?" 
" No. I am in complete concurrence," replIed the old man. "I have 

known of heaven before, but I have also known of hell. And that is where I 
will be gQing to if I do not Uve forever." 

" I see," nodded the potiorunaker. "You wish to live forever so that you 
may not suffer eternal damnation." 

" Yeah, yeah. Can I have it now'?" 
" Certainly," said the potionmaker banding him the bottle. "But do you 

have any questions before taking of the potion'?" 
"I don't think so," snapped the man as he popped the Ud off the bottle 

and ingested Ita contents. 
The old man turned away from the counter and looked out the door. He 

was feeling much better now and he spoke to the potionmaker without 
turning around. 

"Am I going to live forever now'?" he asked. 
" Yes," replied the devil.
