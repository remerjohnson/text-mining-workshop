ACRAMENTO - The 1987-
88 state budget Governor George 
Deukmejian unveiled Thursday 
increases state pending for the 
University by 5.6 percent, raises 
student fees , and provide more 
money for affirmative a tion and 
improving the quality of 
undergraduate education. 

Deukmejian, peaking before a 
Joint session of the sta te 
Legislature, promised additional 
fund ing for schools of aU levels 
because nothing is "more critical 
to California' competitive 
standing or to our future than 
education." 

All told , edl1cation will receive 
55 percent of the state's general 
fund budget next year, "making 
edu anon, without exception, 
California's highest budget 
priority," Deukmejian said. 

Overall , the propo ed ';39

Date rape film 
to be shown 

There will be a special 
shOWing on campus of the film 
Can'l You ee Me, fearuring 
Margaret Avery (of the Color 
Purple), on Wednesday Jan 14 at 
7 pm in TLH 107. The film was 
world premiered at Vacation 
Village last: year and has received 
Critical acclaim from the media. 
Segments of the film have been 
shown on ABC, CBS, BC and 
Entertainment Tonight. 

"Can't You See Me" (which 
~eals wllh the gro\ving problem 
of acquaintance rape in our 
society) was filmed on locallon 
on the UCSD campus and in San 
Diego, It will leave the audience 
with a bener understanding of 
the consequences of rape to 
victims and their loved ones. 

Present at the sHowing will be 
the producer, David Blanchard 
(also a star in the film), and the 
rwo rape victims who asked that 
such a film be produced. 

The event is co·spon ored by 
the Rape Prevention Education 
Program and the PI Kappa Phi 
and endorsed by a number of 
st:udent organizations and clubs. 

Scripps plans to 
erect new pier 

UCSD's Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography awarded the 
construction contract for a new 
1,084-foOl pier to Kiewitt Pacific 
Company of Vallejo, Calif., laS! 
Thursday. 

The new pier will replace the 
Scripps Pier, erected in 1916. An 
all concrete pier, some 65 feet 
longer than the eXisting pier, will 
be constructed over a one-year 
period beginnmg in February 
1987. Total project cost: for the 
pier replacement is ';3.95 
million , with funding from the 

BLOOM COUNTY 

• 

tate of Cali fornla . 
The new pier will be I ated 

immediately south of the old 
pier, which will be demolished 
over a few months after 
construCtion is complete 
A cording to Tom Collins, 
assistant director at ripps 
Insmution , every effon will be 
made to mamtall1 access along 
the beach under the pier dunng 
construction. The project 
operallons will primarily affect 
the Scripps campus. 

The pier Will be built in a 
progression of construction 
decks from which the next 
pilings out will be placed. 
Prefonned concrete pilings Will 
be utihzed , 24 inches in 
diameter and reaching lengths of 
up to 70 feet [or the end of the 
pier, he said . 

The pier is an important 
suppon facility for research and 
educanonal activities at Scripps 
Institution , serving as a source 
for clean seawater, as a platfonn for 
data and specimen collection and 
small boat launching. 

The original wooden pier has 
been one of the most prominent 
landmarks along the San Diego 
co;;;stiine. Its usefulness to 
science over the years is typified 
by the fact that since August 
1916, it has been the site of 
daily seawater temperature and 
salinity measurements, the 
longest continuous readings of 
such ocean conditions from a 
smgle site . It also houses the 
oldest tide gauge station on the 
West Coast:, installed in 1924. 

An elaborate seawater system 
supplies water to the Scripps 
Aquarium and laboratories 
throughout Scripps Institution 
and the neighboring Southwest 
Fisheries Cemer of the National 
Marine Fisheries Service. 

The new seawater system will 
consist of three 1,200 gallon per 

minute pumps to feed large sand 
filtering tanks on the shore , A 
secondary system then pumps 
seawater to holding tanks from 
whl h It may he distributed by 
gravity to ampus buildings The 
current demand for eawater 
exceeds 1.8 milion gallons daily, 

The new pier will have a 1,000 
square foot laboratory at (he 
seaward end for housing 
computer instruments, tide 
gauges, and weather instruments. 
It also will serve as a testing site 
for vanous types of ocean 
instruments prior to usc aboard 
ships or at other locations. 

Professor elected 
meteorological Fellow 

Dr. Richard Cj. Somemlle , 
professor of meteorology at 
UCSD's Scripps InstitutiOn of , 
Oceanograhy, has been elected a 
Fellow of the American 
Meteorological Society. 

This honor recognizes 
Somerville's outstandmg 
contributions to atmospheric 
sciences, according to the 
Society . He will receive the 
award at the annual meeting of 
the society on Monday, January 
12. in ew Orleans, La. 

Somerville's research interests 
are in theoretical meteorology, 
climate modeling and numerical 
weather prediction. He is head 
of the Climate Research Group at 
SCrtppS Institution . 

Prior to joining Scripps in 
1979, Somerville held positions 
with the ational Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, 

ew York University, the 
National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, Columbia 
University and the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research .

Soundwaves measure 
seawater circulation 

Scientists at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography will be using 
soundwaves to measure how 
seawater circulates in the deep 
ocean during a four-year, $2 
million study funded by the 
National Science Foundation , 

The investigation is pan of a 
nine-nation program to observe 
in detail the interactions of the 
atmosphere, ice and ocean in 
the Greenland Sea, a region that 
links the Arctic Ocean and the 
North Atlantic. The Scripps 
group, will work with scienti ts 
from the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institution to 
study the movement of cold 
arctic water as It travels through 
the Greenland Sea into all the 
world's oceans. 

The deep·water, fonned by 
conditions in the Greenland Sea, 
is important to the processes of 
ocean mixing worldwide. This 
cold·water mixing has an effect 
on not only the physical 
propenies of the global ocean, 
but the biological activities as 
well , because it affects the 
distribution of nutrients. An 
additional scientific area affected 
is the accumulation of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere, 
known as the "greenhouse 
effect." Some atmospheric carbon 
dioxide is absorbed into the 
ocean, and the rate of deep-
water mixing has an effect on 
the amount of absorption. 

The researchers will measure

ocean Circulation utillzing a 
re entl), developed technology, 
known as ocean acoustic 
tomograph}'" Similar to the use of 
X· rays to produ e CAT scans 
and the use of seismic waves to 
detennme the ~at1h 's internal 
structure , ocean acousnc 
tomography uses low-frequency 
soundwaves to probe large 
ections of the oceans. 

The elaborate electronics 
equipment for the acoustic 
tomography experiment is not 
commercially available and must 
be designed and built by the 
s ientists and engineers at 
cripps Institution and at Woods 

Hole. The U.S, Navy's Office of 
aval Research has contributed 

more than $600,000 to 
instrument development for the 
Scripps group . 

Five setS of tomography 
instruments will be dep lo}'ed 
dUring the Greenland Sea 
experi ment on cables moored to 
the deep·ocean floor at 
separations of up to 300 miles. 
Each mooring has a transceiver 
with four receivers at different 
depths to increase the number of 
sound-ray paths. The sounds Will 
be emitted in 80-second bursts, 
which take about five minutes to 
tra vel the distance between 
moorings. Over the course of the 
year-long experiment, the 
instruments will transmit for a 
combll1ed total of about 30 
hours. This sampling schedule is 
adequate because the large-scale 
ocean phenomena the scientists 
will study exist and change 
slowly. 

The tomography instruments 
will be deployed in the 
Greenland Sea in the summer of 
1988 and recovered in the 
following summer. 

The overall Greenland Sea 
Project is a five-year program of 
observations coordinated by the 
Arctic Ocean Science Board. The 
countries panicipating include 
Canada, Denmark, the Federal 
Republic of Gennany, Finland, 
France, Iceland , Norway, the 
United Kingdom and the United 
States.

GREG MACCRONE is down , but nO! out. The Muir Senator IS fighnng 
legal battles on and off the 
campus , both of which stem 
from his actions while he was on 
the student council. 

barred MacCrone from attending 
AS. Council and committcc 
meetings for one year, prompting 
MacCrone to ca ll the Board 
decision "wrong," 

Collective , accused the AS. 
Coun Ii of censorship , in that 20 
pages of their newspaper could 
not be published last quaner 
because of the "cffon required to 
file charges." Kalmijn said th,1( 
there was no "budget constraint" 
requiring the A.S. Coun'" to cut 
the new 1I1dlwtor's budget , and 
also that "the A.S. cannot show 

that It ( the ouncll ) IS not cuning 
the new IIldlwtor budget for 
political reasons;" therefore , the 
New Indicator Collecllvc wants 
the money, which has been cut 
by the A. S. Counc li , to be 
restored to them. 

MacCrone appealed his 
sentcnr-e to Tommy Tuc ker, the 
AsSlst,lIlt Vice Chanccllor of 

Undergraduate Affairs , but 
Tucker denied the motion , 
According to MacCrone, he was 
"given a bum steer" by Nick 
Aguilar, the Director of Special 
Services, and should not have 
appealed to Tucker. Now he is 
askll1g for a rehearing, and feels 
he "has a strong case" to take 
before the Judicial Board . IW 

On May 28 of last year, 
MacCrone had a scuffle With four 
members of the New Indicator 
Cnllective, one of whom , R. 
Montgomery Kroopkin , is sUll1g 
him for damages. More recently, 
on June 4 of last year, MacCrone 
was found guilty of illegally 
assuming the chair at a Gtudent 
council meeting. and of having a 
conflict of interest at that same 
meeting. 

"The Board and the students 
do nO! understand the issues," 
MacCrone said . "Instead of 
investigating the case , they JUSt 
heard the arguments , and the 
better debater won." 

Brad Earhan , Judicial Board 
Chai r, could nO! be reached for 
comment, and neither could the 
other Board members. 

Incinerator future still unknown 

While MacCrone had no 
comment on the laWSUit, Roben 
Bums, Kroopkin's lawyer, sa id 
that a hearing was set for January 
21 to hear MacCrone's lawyers 
complaints about the suit (called 

'"a demur). Also named in the suit 
are UCSD, the Associated 
Students Council (AS.) and the 
Regents of the University of 
California. The University's 
lawyers already demurred on 
November 21 and won only twO 
minor victories, according to 
Bums. ' We've filed a complaint 
asking for compensatory damges 
as well as charging MacCrone 
with assault and banery," said 
Bums, adding that the civil 
penalty is up to three times 
actual damages and punitive 
damages could go up LO 25,000 
dollars. 

At UCSD, the Judicial

MacCrone went on to accuse 
the New Indicator Collective of 
overaggressive tactics. "They 
didn't get the amount of money 
they wanted lor their newspaper, 
so they're going on a crusade 
and attacking counci l members," 
MacCrone said . "Instead of the 
personality conflict that it is 
(between Kroopkin and 
MacCrone), the New Indicator 
(Collective) is calling it, wrongly, 
a political conllic!." 

The confl ict-of-i nterest charge 
stems from MacCrone taking pan 
in the decision making process 
for determining the budgets of 
UCSD's several alternative media 
newspapers, of which the new 
indicator is one. Seven more 
charges have been filed against 
the AS. Council and various 
members of it, a ll concerning 
what the New Indicator . 
Collective sees as political bias of

T HIS wcek, the San Diego City Council IS scheduled to consider extending

it had approved on Octobcr 2tl 
of last year. The ordinance, 
which establishes a Conditional 
Use Permit (CUP) process for 
hazardous wa ste treatment

demonstration facilities , was 
enacted in response to concern 
over General Atomic 
Technologies' intention to begin 
routine testing of their 
Circulating Bed Combustor 
(CSC) which applies newly 
developed methods of toxic 
waste incineration . 

Public interest was sparked 
when GA Technologies submitted 
an application fo r a Research,

m e ,(te ndmg the interim 
ordinance, The planning 
commission has been working 
on a permanent ordinance 
which would replace the 
temporary one. The reason for 
the extension , Dugan said , is 
that the commiSSIOn hasn 't been 
able to move the permanent 
ordinance through as qUickly as 
they had hoped . 

GA Technologies hopes to 
market copies of their pilot CBC 
to industries which generate 
toxic waste . Before they can 
begin testing and demonstrating 
their new incinerator, they must 
have their operation approved by 
the EPA, the Caltfomia 
Depanment of Health Services 
(DHS) and the San Diego Air 
Pollution Control District 
(APCD), and also thm facility 
must be in comphance with San 
Diego zoning regulations and the 
Uniform Fire Code. 

The DHS is currently 

reViewing an environmental risk 
assessment conducted at their 
request by Radian, a private 
consultant firm , and will decide 
if an Environmental Impact 
Repon (EIR) is needed . 
Opponents to the operation of 
the CBC claim an EIR should be 
conducted to ensure the safety o f 
the incinerator 

The California Environmental 
Quality Act stipulates that there 
shall not be any unnecessary 
EIR's conducted and the 
decision to condUCt o ne be 
made by the "lead agency," 
which in this case is the DHS. 

The EPA is in the process of 
responding to comments on the 
draft RD&D permit for GA 
Technologies which was 
delivered during their public

A right to exist 
By LISA WAGNER 

O N Thursday, November 13 the Organization of Arab tudents held a panel discussion enmled 
"Terrorism and U.S. Policy." The 
discussion, however, began with a 
statement about the illegitimacy of the 
State of Israel and ' further on 
into a Palestini IghL~ ra . ~1W~rfII'''

sta ents made during this discussion

I ) "Israel is an wtificial enllry created by 
rite Unired Nations and has no nghr to 
eXist. " 

Arab rheroric invariably begins by 
claiming that Israel has no right to exist 
as a sovereign Jewish state. Israel , in 
fact, has a millenial and continuous 
history more ancient than that of most 
oth5tions. Its Inteaal "birth , 
certi te" was validat y the promis 
of th ible: uninterru ewish 
settlement from the time of Joshua 
onward; the British Balfour Declaration 
of 1917; the League of Nations Mandate , 
which incorporated the Balfour 
Declaration; the United Nations 
partition resolution of 1947; Israel's 
admission ro the Uni ted ations in 
1949; the recognition of Israel by most 
other states; and the society created by 
Israel's people in decades of thriving, 
dynamic national existence. 

The Jewish peopl~ have maintained 
ties to their historic homeland for more 
than 3,700 years. A national language 
and a distinct civilization have been 
maintained. The return to Israel has 
continued throughout the centuries, and 
78 years of nation-building, beginning 
in 1870, culminated with the 
reestablishment of the Jewish Sta

Furthennore , Israel's economic trade 
with outh Africa is miniscule in 
comparison to th e trade between South 
~~ ~ope, Aiao t~S and even 

il'rme black African states. A rding to 
the International Monetary Fu 
trade with South Africa amoun 0 less 
than one-half of one percent South 
Africa's total trade. 

h onically, it is the Arab st es with 
whom outh Africa maintains xtensive " 
trade ties. According to the Sh ping 
Research Bureau in Amsterdam outh 
Africa receives much of its oil m Arab 
members of OPEC. During 197 and 
early 1980, the Bureau, an anti-
apart id research foundation , 
that h Africa had received

Emirates.

(lvilians and are illegal." 

Following an April 1979 t 
attack that killed four Israel 
including twO small childre 
announced that it would a 
seek out terrorist bases ra t 
for terrorist attacks.

, Israel 
resively 
r than wait 

This policy was defe d by the then 
National Securi r in the Reagan 
White House card V. Allen . In i-
interview i ebruary 1981, Allen St 
that "t e extent that one reaches t 
the urce of terrorism, then , of COUTSe, 
t e is ample justification for taking 
ction .... Reaching to the source is 

generally recognized as 'hot pursuit' of a 
sort, and therefore justified." 

When civilian lives are lost during 
Israeli raids, tN.. fault must be assigned 
to the Palestini~ Liberation 
Organization (PLO) terrOnStS , who 
deliberately locate their bases \vithin 
population centers and refugee camps 
in order to use the civilians as shields. 

On July 19, 1981 the PLO bragged of 
its attacks on civilians: "The heavy 
rocket and artillery units of the 
Palestinian ] Joim forces continued to 

s eli military pOSitions Isic] in 
northern a rom the very same 
positions the Israelis . ed to have 
destroyed. The Joint Force ched 
heavy rocket and anillery attac 
yesterday on Israeli positions at' 
Nahariya, Misgav Am, She'ar Yashuv, 
Dan , Eshkol, and Kiryat Shemona. The 
same units launched another attack 
today on th e Israeli positions in Upper 
Gal ilee and inflicted heavy casualties." 
VOICe of Palestine, as reported by 
Palestine Congress of North America. 

Israeli attacks against terrorist 
co ncemmtlons are not indiscriminate . 
According to American new accounts, 
dozens of terrorist raids have been 
thwarted and scores of terronsts killed. 
In one Israeli raid in June 1979, th e 
coordinating commmee for terronst 
operations was Wiped out. Israel's 
respon.,e IS legnimate self-defense. On 
October 1. 1974, on the U.s Senate

I picked up the Guardian 
Monday evening at the extension 
office and touk interest in the 
lener by Gina Silverman 
exhorting the Chancellor to 
Involve UCSD in opposing the 
GA Technologies TOXIC Waste 
Incinerator PilOt Plant. 

I am an employee at GA. and I 
am quite concerned about th e 
limited informa tion bei ng made 
available about the project. We 

who work Ihere, with the 
excepllon of personnel directly 
involved and upper managemem, 
have no more opportun ity than 
the general public [Q learn what 
\viII be going on, if the necessary 
permits are granted . Personally, 1 
hope the proposal receives a 
thorough review by the 
concerned public agencies. 
What motivates me to write, 
however, IS Ms. Silvennan's 
added comment Ihat there are 
"two 'Chernobyl-type' graphite 
nuclear reactors at the GA Site," 

which she says 15 4800 reci lrom 
UCSD's cam pus. GA's campus I, 
Just acrdss Gcnesee from your

wide when you try to ross With 
the traffic light There are also no 
"Chernobyl-type ," or other rype. 
graphite nuclear reactors at GA. 
Not to worry . 

The statements Ms. Silverman 
made about the incinerator are, 
however, alanning. I hope she is 
equally wrong on those facts.

urges Chancellor Atkinson to 
"ask for a full and complete

these requiremems have been

there was good deal of publicity

approximately) 1.86 billion. 
When slUder.t fees and other 
general purpose funds totalling 
'li329 111illton and 'Ii 15 million 
from the state lottery are added 
In, the Umver ity's total 
proposed budget for next year 
equals 'li2,203 ,642,OOO, a $117 
million 1Ilcrease from las[ year. 

The proposed UC budget 
increase is close to the 5.5 
percent increase , exclusivc of 
sa lary raises, that the UC Board 
of Regents sought. 

The University asked for 
money 10 fin ance a 5.7 percenl 
faculty pay raise but Deukmejian 
only included sufficient money 
for a 3 pereent increase. 

According to a University 
spokesperson , UC President 
David Gardner is not displeased 
with the governor's proposed 
budget, given the weak state of 
California's economy. 

"He is cognizant of the state 's 
economy," the spokesperson said, 
and believes the budget is 

co nslsrent with curre nt economic 
trends 

U will adopt a "wall-and-see" 
attitude about askIng for more 
money, she sa Id . "If the stale 
econom) picks up , it may be 
pos ible that we'll go to the 
govcrnor and the Legislature 
seeking more money," 

The budget proVIdes ror 
conttnued enrollment growth and 
tncreased suppOrt for instruction 
and libraries, research, building 
mallltenance, and faCIlities 
ren vation and consmuction. 

The governor's blldget calls for 
an approximately ~lJO student 
fee increase , the firs t since 1983-
1984, and increased financial aid 
and affirmative action programs. 

"To ensure thaI no student is 
denied access to UC as a result of 
the fee increase, financial aid will 
be provided to those students who 
cannot afford to pay the fee 
increase," the budget sta tes. 

"In order to ensure that the 
University increases the 
representation of ethnic 
minorities among the students 
and on the faculty , $1 million 
has been provided for affirmative 
action programs." the budget

that was lucky enough to be 
resting up there! The wind 
picked up as quickly as the 
temperature dropped - one of 
the pleasures of being at the top, 
I suppose. The big brass ring I 
was climbing for was disguised 

a~ ,I bright orange marker, 
mdlcallng mat ·you have

As we filed up. everyone 
touched the marker, feeling

leI OUI s reams of ex itement , 
breaking into another round of 
"They call it that good ole 
Moumain Dew, Dew, Dew .. ." I 
JUst found myself a nice little 
boulder and sa l. I personally 
thanked the heavens , which 
were an arm's reach away. The 
only certainty In my life at this 
POlOt wa that the torture was at 
least half over. Now, I am not a 
math major, bUl I knew that only 
a mlmmurn of three and a half 
climbing hours could poss ibly 
await me . QUite a comforting 
thought. 

I started to gel comfortable -
my fetal position and thi s rock 
were finally begmmng to meld , 
when I heard it was time for 
"The Descent." I told the group 
III go ahead, I'd meet them later. 
The leader tumed to me and 
said , ·What goes up must come 
down." I guess it'~ answers like 
that which made him a leader 
and me a followe r. I grinned , 
elenched my tceth and once 
again tned to catch up wi th the 
others. 

Our downwatd exodus was 
IWO and a half hours of conllnual 
Jumping over hr,lnches and

- Just what Perrier salesman 
would love to explOit. What 
better excuse to stop for a 
minute , than the neceSSity of 
sipping from these streams. 
Believing in the purity of the 
water, I cupped my hands and 
gulped away. oon , this pleasure 
had ended and we were moving 
again . 

The last half hour was hiked 
III the dark - great experien e 
for a novice. I stepped in 
puddles three feet deep. As I 
retrieved my leg, I thought about 
the test myoid L L Bean boots 
were oclllg put through. They 
uccessfully passed their trial. 

Soon after I passed . .. OUI. 
The next thing I knew, we 

were in a cabin with another 
Dartmouth Outing Club group 
who, it is said , climbed a more 
difficult mountalll (where I 
wondered?). The hot chocolate, 
marshmallows, and sulfur/ egg 
water around the fire added to 
the already too authentic 
atmosphere. 

The next morning, after a 
healthy six hour nap, those who 
were goi ng to climb were off (I 
got their names, JUSt in case). 
Needless to say, I stayed on level 
ground and obse rved nature 
from afar. 

The following Sunday was 
Home Sweet Dartmouth. I gOt 
to my room , smiled at my 
roommate and woke up on 
Monday f couldn't quite get out 
of bed at 8:30 alll as planned. 
The convulsions from my 101.5 
fever and the horrendous 
stOmach cramps which had 
accompanied my headaches put 
a damper on my morning. "It's 
nothmg," I thought. "If I can 
climb a mountain , I can bnl ve a 
little fever.'" Then I heard my 
roommate calling the IIlflrmary

In between the many turnove rs 

commi tted by each team. the 
Tritons jumped out to an early 
l4 point lead, a margin thaI 
never really changed throughout 
the game. Although they could 
never get completely on track 
Ihemselves, UCSD's man-to-man 
defense conti nuously frustrated 
th e Peru tate offense. "We 
didn't pIa)' well early," explained

capturing the championship of

UCSD has now won s ix game

from the o utSid e and fini shed 
with a game high 22 points. But 
se nior Shanda Elzy was the 
dominant playe r on the court. 
She ran the offense and made 
severa l good defensi ve plays . 
.. he's always the key," said 
Malone of the pOint guard . 
Ragatz. however. was the only 
UCSD player to make the all-
tourname nt leam. 

The championship game. by 
contrast. was cleanly played . as it 
"''liS obvious that Pomona-Pitzer 
and Millikin were the class of th e 
tournament. Led by forward and 
all-tOurnament selection Queen 
Dicke rson . the Millikin Big Blue 
took a quick 8-0 !ead and looked 
as if they might blowout the 
Sagehens. But Dickerson gOI 
three early fouls and was forced 
to sit out much of the game. By 
halftime , the game was tied at 34 
and with tournament MVP 
Regina juniel in control. Pomona 
outscored the Big Blue 68-54 by 
the end of the game . 

According to Millikin coach 
Lon Kerans, their game plan was 
geared toward keepingjuniel 
from Ihe inside. "We wanted to 

Commenta(Y-

make juniel shoOt from outs ide 
the free throw line," she said . In 
that. thcy were successful . but 
the MVP was hitting her outside 
shOts and the Big Blue just 
couldn'l keep up. Still . Kerans 
was pleased with her team's 
performance. 

To reach the championship 
game Millikin defeated UCSD 
Friday night a nd Pomona-Pitzer 
beal Peru State . But the strangest 
game of the tourname nt came 
Wednesday. when UCSD won its 
first round game against Mills, 
100-19. "They JUSt missed their 
shots ," explained Malone of the 
game where Mills scored just four 
points in Ihe second half. With 
their twO tournament wins the 
Tritons are now 8-6 in Ihe 
season. 

The overall evaluation of the 
fi rst an n ual tournament was 
mixed . The se ntiment from 
Coach Kerans was that "it was 
run very nicely." but Peru Sta te 
Coach Davidson implied his 
team may not return if invited . 
His team is used to playing 
physical games but he felt the 
poor officiating made the action 
a bit rough. 1m 

Four colleges divide spirit 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 

THE MEN'S Basketball season opened on November 21 , 1986 with 
Spirit Night against Azusa Pacific . 
The title of the event was 
somewhat ironic as a unified 
spirit was the missing element 
that evening. Out of a possible 
15,000 fans , a mere 400+ found 
their way to the game. These 
students were then split up into 
their respective colleges and 
respective cheers. A halftime 
contest decided which college 
had the most spirit. But an effort 
to unify the colleges to create 
· university" spirit was rarely 
anempted. 

HAVE A GREAT 
TAN FOR THE 
NEW YEAR 

It is said, rime and time again , 
that sc hool spirit relies on the 
existence of a football team. 
However, this is not the case at 
UCSD. In an interview, Tom 
Marshall. head coach of the 
men's basketball team , seemed to 
have located the source of the 
problem , "The fragmentation of 
the school into four colleges is 
what affects our spirit. 
Academically, the set-up is very 
successful. But the total college 
experience needs to include 
athletics as well." In expressing 
their spirit, the four independent 
colleges at UCSD must realize

Commentary 
Continued from page L 2 
that they are all a pan of a 
university and that they must 
combine the support the 
university as one. 

Marshall presented a very 
rational plan to help stan such 
an effon. To begin with , if the 
students want a program they 
will have to pay for It. Currently, 
UCSD students pay the lowest 
registration fees among the UC 
schools, primarily becau e the 
olher schools use some of their 
fees !O help their athletics 
depanment. A simple $10 
increase in each student's fees 

would add another 150,000 to 
tne)budget. a tremendous 
increase . 

Secondly, the infonnation 
package received by swdents at 
the beginning of the year should 
include a season ticket package 
and a sporting events calendar. 
In this way the students have the 
option of taking care of the 
tickets in advance. providing an 
Incentive to attend. 

With these new funds. twO 
new positions, Marshall explains. 
can be implemented into the 
athletics depallment : a sport 
relations director and a sports 
information director. The sports

relations directOr talks to the 
surrounding communi ty in 
attempts to bnng in sponsors to 
the games. In reases in indoor 
pnzes and halftime contests 
would undoubtedly increase 
incentive and school spiril 

A SPOrtS infolmation director 
would help pm UCSD into the 
co mmunity presses, getting 
information to the people . 
Currently, UCLA has 21 people 
working to supply newspapers 
with information about their 
teams. With an Information 
director. UC D could elicit th e 
suppOrt of La Jolla reSidents and 
perhaps find itself with packed 
bleachers at every home game. 

The systems must be 
programmed for the school as a 
whole instead of each college 
programming itself. In that way, 
the sehool maintains a sense of 
UnIty. However, It could take 
years before this system can 
work. Until then, the students 
should take it upon themselves 
to attend the games. They should 
work with what they have to 
prove to the administration that 
they support the teams already 
in existence. Then , and only 
then , should they consider the 
possibilities of a football team . 
The potential exists. The 
students have to find il and then 
prove it as a universiry.

In their next game, UCSD 
crushed Menlo College 85-68 a~ 
head coach Tom Marshall had 
the luxUlY of emplying out his 
bench . 3Intlgnon had 26 and 
Kamansky hit for 18 points. 

UCSD's next encounter is
