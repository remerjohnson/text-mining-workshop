Doolittle, York Enter 
Pol itics With Ideal ism 

Dr. Russell F. Doolittle, a 
member of UCSD's Chemistry 
department will seek the Demo-
cratic nomination for the US 
Congress (35th district) in the 
upcoming June 4 California pri-
mary. 

Doolittle's decision to run was 
based on what hetermeda "social 
consciousness", both as a citizen 
and a scientist. He said that in a 
badly gerrymandered district 
which stretches from La Jolla to 
Santa Ana the incumbent Republi-
can Utt has not even had to cam-
paign in recent years. He intends 
to bring some of the issues to 

Choice '68 
Offers 
Expression 
Along with the AS General 

Elections on April 24, UCSD 
students will have the opportunity 
to express their preferences for 
US president, Vietnam policy, and 
the "urban crisis." 

CHOICE '68, the name of the 
project, 1s being operated on over 
1000 campuses across the coun-
try. It is sponsored by TIME 
magazine. 

All voting will be done on com-
puter cards which will be re-
turned to TIME's headquarters 
in New York for tabulation. 

The candidates on the ballot 
are as follows: Fred Halstead 
(SociaUst Worker), Mark Hat-
field (Rep.) Lyndon Johnson 
(Oem), Robert F. Kennedy (Dem), 
Martin L. King (Independent), 
John Linsay (Rep.), Eugene Mc-
Carthy (Dem.), Richard NIxon 
(Rep.), Charles Percy (Rep.), 
Ronald Reagan (Rep.), Nelson 
Rockefeller (Rep.), Harold Stas-
sen (Rep.), George Wallace 
(American Independent).

the people. Because of the exis-
tence of strong conservative e le-
ments in the area his campaign 
will be an uphill battle, but Doo-
little is counting on student sup-
port in his effort. 

When asked to comment on the 
place of the scientist in politics, 
Doolittle stated that the scientist 
of today should "come out of his 
shell and tell the people the truth 
about what the future holds in 
store." He felt that Congress 
was an "antiquated system, II with 
"a complete lack of vision. II 
Specifically he spoke of the de-
pletion of natural resources. 

Doolittle, describing himself 
as a "wild-eyed moderate," des-
cribed the Vietnam War as 
"senseless," and felt that it was 
diverting attention from the more 
important issues, such as minor-
ity groups and the cities. 

York Works For McCarthy 
Dr. Herbert F. York, chancel.' 

lor of UCSD in 1961, is a mem-
ber of the 174-man McCarthy 
slate that will run for election 
in the upcoming Democratic pri-
mary in California. 

Although this is the first time 
he has participated in electoral 
politics, York has held high rank-
ing posts under three presidents-
Eisenhower, Kennedy, and John-
son. He served on the President's 
Scientific Advisory Committee, 
and the U.S. Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency. He was 
also an assistant Secretary of 
Defense - Director of Defense 
Research and Engineering. 

York stated that he had pre-
viously become convinced that 
the U.S. needed to find a way 
to get out of Vietnam. He and 
others who felt as he did were 
searching for a political vehicle 
to air their views. McCarthy, 
being the first politician of na-
tional status to come out against 
the war, provided them with a

AS General Elections will be 
held on 24 April, the AS Senate 
announced last Tuesday. Presi-
dent, Vice-president, and the 8 
senators will be elected. 

According to Vice-pres ident 
Herv Sweetwood, candidates will 
need 3% of the undergraduates' 
signatures in his college to qual-
ify for the ballot. Thus candi-
dates for Muir's three Senators-

at-large will need 15 Signatures, 
and those for Revelle' s three Sen-
ators will need 60. Candidates 
for campus-wide offices (Presi-
dent, V.P., Upper- and Lower-
Division Senator s) will need 75 
s ignatures from Muir and Re-
velle Colleges. (However, no 
s trict percentage from each Col-
lege is required.

Dulles Speaks On Policy 
The United states' policy to-

ward China should be more than 
a set of fitful reactions, Foster 
Rhea Dulles told a large crowd 
on campus last week. 

Speaking on "US Policy toward 
East Asia After Vietnam," the 
expert in US Diplomatic History 
explained his alternatives to the 
present policy of "containment of 
China," which we have followed 
since the Communists' takOover 
in 1949. 

"The state Department's at-
titude," he said, "was confused, 
concerned, and floundering after 
the takeover. The United States 
was unwilling to recognize China 
because of the harsh treatment 
accorded to American officials." 

By 1950, Dulles asserted, US 
policy had definitely become one 
of containment and intervention 
in China's internal affairs. 

"Secretary of State Acheson 
based all actions on contain-
ment, and rejected any talk of 
accomodations with China. Even 
at this time, Dean Rusk was in 
favor of an alternate approach: 
the US must consider ChinaJUlder 
the influence of Russian con-
spiracy. 

Eventually, the policy devel-
oped into 5 points: 

I. Refuse recognition of Com-
munist China; 

2. Refuse admittance to the 

United Nations (short of veto); 
, 3. Embar go all trade from 
China; 

4. Contain all cultural and po-
litical tendencies in China; and 

5. Aid For mosa. 
This policy, Dulles held, weak-

ened the US prestige in China, 
which could call the Americans 
the successor s to the 19th cen-
tury imperialists , who dominated 
China to such a great extent. 

In the present presidential 
race, he said, "our policy should 
not be governed by the old ways 
(of Johnson and Nixon). We do 
not need (Joe) McCarthylsm. We 
must accept the new revolution-
ary forces of nationalism in Asia. 

Dulles said that " nationalism 
is indeed a stronger force than 
Communism." 

China must be drawn into the 
international community, he 
maintained. The United States 
can help China learn her re-
sponsibilities in the world. 

"Even now," he said, " China's 
moderation and restraint in mili-
tary matters contrasts her prop-
aganda." 

The United states, he con-
cluded, must "avoid the ten-
dency to intervene militarily in 
the affairs of A~ian countries. 
Vietnam stands as the most trag-
ic example of how we can allow 
ourselves to fall into the trap 
of war." 

Galbraith Knocks Vietnam Policy 
John Kenneth Galbraitt. told an 

audience of several hundred Mon-
day night in Sherwood Hall that 
we must accept the fact that 
the Viet Cong will control most 
of South Vietnam in any settle-
ment we make to end the War. 
Furthermore they will eventually 
have a major say in any govern-
ment which includes the cities. 

In light of this, Galbraith said, 
we should negotiate to secure the 
safety of those in Vietnam who 
looked to us for help and sup-
ported our position. Their pro-
tection is what we should seek 
in a negotiated settlement. 

Professor Galbraith said that 
the Vietnam War is an extension 
of "second generation" policy. 
This policy was established after 
World War II when we broke 
with the Soviet Union. Basically, 
it means to oppose communism. 
This policy was needed to con--
tain a communist conspiracy that 
was irreconcilably opposed to 
OJIf existence. 

, However, Galbraith said, 
though that view of communism 
has changed, our policy hasn't. 
The reason for this is that any 
organization has a tendency to-
wards dogma. Only strong lead-
ership can pull it out of its 
inertia--so far we haven't had 
strong leaders . We are com-
mitted to this outmoded pollcy 
because " only organizational 
committments and the old leader s 
remain." 

The consequences oUhis policy 
in Southeast Asia are evident. 
The policy is still based on in-
flexible differences between East 
and West. This " second genera-
tion" policy has alienated many 
former allies . As the conflict 
turned out to be against national 
communism instead of outside 
intruders , nations of the world 
began to op se our pos ition. 

Galbraith concluded that we 
have now come to the end of 
second generation policy and we 
must look to n w leaders. 

Student Activities Office, Build-
ing 250 MC, or in the Revelle 
Resident Dean's Office, Argo 
Hall. The petitions must be re -
turned no later than 5 p.m., 16' 
April. No late petitiOns will be 
accepted, Sweetwood said. 

The Constitution only requires 
that candidates have a grade 
point average of no less than 
2.0, and that they be in good 
s tanding. 

This will be the first year 
that Revelle College will not 
control the Senate. Muir will 
have an opportunity for equal 
representation, despite its smal-
ler student body. A college could 
control the Senate, however , by 
winning both Upper- and Lower-
Division Senate seats. 

At its meeting next week, the 
Senate will approve a Commis-
sioner of Elections and modify 
the election by- laws in order to 
avoid differences of opinion when 
votes are counted, a predicament 
which occur red last year.

Cafeteria 
Bids Sought 

The Unive rsity's Business Of-
fice is in the process of re -
bidding the contract for campus 
food service, Bill Borsari, Auxil-
iary Enterprises Director , said 
yesterday. 

Bids have been sent out to 
eleven different companies, and 
discussions with s tudents , faculty 
and s taff will begin in the ear ly 

~rt of May. 
From discussions with Joseph 

Hutchison, Unive r sity Business 
Manager, and George Murphy, 
Dean of Student Affairs, Bor sar i 
outlined the deep concern over 
the present quality of meals which 
has been evident since October 
1967. ' 

"Without a doubt," he ex-
plained, "there is general unrest 
on campus about the food and 
food service. Students are not 
happy with the Prophet Com-
pany' s perfor mance. Further-
more, we have rece ived the im-
pression that the ser vice is not 
impr Oving. With the hopes of 
redefining ou r needs in terms 
of meal service, we have opened 
up the bids." 

Bor sari emphasized the im-
portance of student involvement 
in the selection of a caterer on 
campus. "It students are not 
aware of the st p we are taking 
in meeting their requests, we 
could ~ ve se r ious misunder-
standing!'. " 

The Prophet Company is not 
automatically excluded from bid-
ding, B r s r i id. sinc the Uni-
versity cannot discr iminate a-
gainst people or organizations. 

The bidding companie- are 
ing asked to consid r thse three 
plans of service: (I)The pre nt

" open" system, in which s coods

AS Offices Need 
Greater Leadership 

This year's AS elections present a most important responsibility 
before those students who look forward to participating in student 
government. Now. as never before. UCSD needs positive leaders hip 
in shaping its future course in campus organization. Wjll the AS 
continue its present. confused modes of action. in which ideas become 
realities with an awful lot of luck and labor? Or can the AS become a 
sounding board for progrrssive thought in not only social activities 
but also academic and intellectual problems facing this University? 

In a previous editorial, the Triton Times criticized the AS Senate 
for failing to arouse student enthusiasm. We didoverlook such achieve-
ments as the barnDoor and increased awareness of administrative 
problems facing the ASUCSD. But the challenges still remain: the 
AS must become more representative of student needs. The people 
who run for offioe this year have a duty to the future of our campus 
to do better than the present administration. 

Among other · reforms suggested in student government circles 
is the restructurin~ of the AS so that AS government committees 
could work with the Academic and Campus-wide committees. The 
1968- 69 ASUCSD will have to face up to such a radical change in student 
government , as well as decide once and for all how it should live 
with college governments. 

But UCSD is used to radical ideas--not only political but also 
administrative. The Triton Times calls on all undergrads to think 
for a minute about the future of UCSD. Can you contribute anything 
to this campus? 

Express Yourself 
I n This Colum n 

The recent decision of the UCSD Communications Board to support 
only one campus newspaper has reemphasized the Times' responsi-
bility of representing all student views on all subjects of apparent 
interest and importance. The Times has felt this responsibility 
since the inception of its publication in May of 1967. but until now 
has had an alternate mouthpiece to air opinions of the SIL, 80S. 
and other radical groups or individuals. 

At this Juncture, it is necessary to maintain in the official campus 
paper the many facets of student thinking and expression. Were 
this newspaper not to accept this responsibUity. the spirit behind its 
formation would be a theory of the past instead of a hard-working 
reality. 

In keeping with this philosophy, Mwandishi from the Black Student 
Council has submitted material to be printed in the editorial section 
of the Times in the April 12 issue. None of this material will be 
censored. All submissions will be given the same treatment providing 
they are "clean" and of reasonable lp.ngth. 

Il you have a thought or an ax to grind and need a means of ex-
pression, this newspaper was designed to be exactly that. in each 
issue the Times hopes to present several opposing editorial opinions 
when submitted in order that the UCSD student may make his own 
choice in the light of opposing argument. 

Il the University is a forum for different opinions, then use this 
campus' "fourth estate" to project them. In short, use your campus 
newspaper, that's what it's here for.

A letter appeared in your 
March 8 issue announcing a reso-
lution "unanimously passed at a 
recent meeting of graduate stu-
dents in the Literature Depart-
ment" in support of Chairman 
Roy Harvey Pearce and other& 
who s1ined the letter of support 
to Japanese student protesters. 
As a graduate student in the De-
partment of Literature, I wish 
to make it unequivocally clear 
that I do not support that resolu-
tion. 

It is my understanding that the 
letter to the Japanese rioters was 
signed in a manner which implied 
the support of their action by 
the students and facuIty of this 
University. I do not supporltheir 
action, and I condemn the action 
of those who have. But even if 
this were not my position on the 
Japanese protesters, I would still 
think it disgraceful to imply the 
support of those who disagreed 
with me. 

It is ironiC. then, that the 
graduate students who passed 
their "unan Im')us" resolution 
have indulged In the same sort 
of deception engaged in by those 
who sent the original letter . Al-
though the graduate students 
surely have a right to their 
opinions, I emphatically disagree 
with their action and their speci-
ous atte mpt to include me in 11. 
I was not informed of any meet-
ing at which such a resolution 
was to be discussed, and am 
appalled at their public display 
of dishonesty in implying my 
assent. 

I r egret that a number of my 
co lleagues have made this at-
te mpt to protect my integrity 
necessary.

I am indebted to Congress-
man Stull for pointing out that 
only 5% of the UCSD Human-
ities Faculty are Republicans. 
At first I could hardly credit 
this low figure; but, on check-
ing for myself, I found that it 
was absolutely correct. I ex-
tended my researches, and dis-
covered that in the Faculty of 
Science, too, there are only 5% 
Republicans. What is more, this 
is true of four other university 
campuses in CalUornla. Checking 
still further, I found that among 

Editor, The Triton Times; 

We are a group of students of 
the Genoa University. As we like 
to honour the memory of the most 
famous Genoese actor Gilberto 
Govi, we have founded and dedi-
cated to his name, the University 
Genoese Theatrical Company. 
The Rectory of our University, 
Prof. Gerolamo Orestano, has 
accepted the Honorary Presi-
dence, and Dott. Giuseppe Wil-
liner has accepted the Executive 
Presidence of it. 

The purpose of our activity is 
that of maintaining alive the in-
terest in the theatrical culture . 
which is certainly one of the 
soundest element for the recip-
rocal acquaintance between na-
tions. 

We would like to realise all 
this, organizing. with our Uni-
versity means only. a theatrical 
show and establishing at the Ge-
noa University a Fund for finan-
cially handicapped students , who 
will take a degree with a thesis 
concerning the theatre of every 
time and nationality. 

As you can see we have a lot 
of good ideas and enthusiasm. 

Unfortunately we are also ob-
liged to ask you all for a fi-
nancial contribute which will help 
us to get over our problems. It 
is not very important the amount 
of your help for us, but it is 
important the sol1dariety you will 
show to us. 

Editor, Triton Times: 

Letters in such bad taste as 
those your pseudo-paper has 
been pr inting, which try to make 
fun of earnestly devoted men like 
Herbert Marcuse, show why THE 
INDICA TOR should be put back 
in its rightful place as the sole 
representative oC campus opin-
ion. Since you now claim to repre-
sent us, print this! 

Sylvia Bru no 

the students on the 1967 Deans 
Lists, only 5% were Republicans; 
and that, of the students admitted 
to Graduate Schools , the pro-
portion was equally small. This 
1s certainly evidence for dis-
crimlnatlon---but maybe It's .ile 
people concerned who are dis-
criminating. One cannot assert 
absolutely that no Republicans 
are intelligent , or that no in-
telligent person votes Republi-
can; but, as Congressman stull 
cogently pointed out, there seem 
to be relatively few exceptions 
to such generalizations.

Editor. Triton Times: 

On Monday, February 26, a stu-
dent made two separate attacks on 
the SIL table in Revelle Plaza. Two 
members of the SIL were injured 
sl1ghtly. The attacker made his 
first strike around noon, hitting 
one member of the organization 
and trying to dismantle the SIL 
bookstand. Restrained by a campus 
policeman and asked to leave the 
Free Speech Plaza, he returned 
twenty minutes later. He struck 
several members of the SIL, in-
jured one by overturning the book-
stand, and damaged the bookstand. 
He was restrained by several other 
students until he lett. Dean Hull 
arrived shortly afterward. 

Without a doubt, this is the most 
serious denial of free speech to 
occur at UCSD this year. The use 
of violence to suppress debate 
cannot be condoned in anacademic 
community. While the administra-
tion has taken steps to deal with 
the student involved, we feel that 
some public action should be taken 
to demonstrate the university's 
commitment to free speech. A 
public statement would also be 
helpful in countering the false 
news reports about this incident, 
such as the one that appeared in 
the "LA Times" on Feb. 27. 

The facts In this case are not 
in dispute. That the attack on the 
SIL table was unprovoked and, 
since the student involved returned 
to repeat the offense after being 
ordered to leave by a campus 
policeman, It is clear that the 
attack was In part premeditated. 
The Office of student Affairs has 
investigated the case, and a list 
of witnesses' names was given to 
Dean Hull. 

Since the issue is so clear, we 
call on the administration to state 
the facts for the benefit of the 
communi y, correct the erroneous 
news stories that have alreadyap-
peared, and make it clear that no 
inlringment of the right at free 
speech In the Plaza Will be per-
mitted.

Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra" at the Old Globe Theater, starting 
April 9. 

Old Globe Presents Shaw's 
nCaesar and Cleopatra" 
Two of history's most legend-

ary rulers, Caesar and Cleopa-
tra, will confront each other on 
stage opening April 9 at the Old 
Globe Theatre, Balboa Park. A-
mong George Bernard Shaw's 
most popular comedies, "Caesar 
and Cleopatra" will be one oUhe 
most elaborate winter season 
productions in recent seasons at 
the Old Globe Theatre. Lavish 
ancient Roman and Egyptiancos-
tumes and properties have been 
designed by art director Peggy 
Keliner. 

William Roesch has staged 
"Caesar and Cleopatra" with 
Dennis G. Turner as the fatherly 
Roman s tatesman and Sheila 
Byrne as the spoiled teenage 
Egyptian queen. Performances 
are scheduled April 9 through 
May 5, nightly except Monday. 

As Shaw begins hispIaY,JuUus 
Caesar has crossed the Mediter-
ranean Sea in pursuit of the 
fleeing Pompey after the break-
up of the triumvirate. At the 
sphinx outside Alexandria, he 
discovers a frightened girl. The 
child fears being eaten alive by 
the barbarian Julius Caesar. She 
is Cleopatra. Her younger broth-
er, ptolemy, and his followers 
have deposed her from the throne 
of Egypt. Through charm and 
youthful appeal, Cleopatra en-
gages the support of Caesar, 
who turns his army against ptol-
emy and returns Cleopatra to 
her position as queen of Egypt. 

A mature and mellow philoso-
pher and statesman, Caesar at-
tempts to instill in the willful 
young queen the responsibilities 
of ruling an empire . He is par-
tially successful, as he fails to 
instill in her his love of human-
ity. 

Major supporting roles will 
be played by Priscilla Allen as 
Cleopatra' s nurse Ftatateeta,

Those honored from UC's nine 
campuses are among 1,124 stu-
dents at 309 colleges and uni-
versities in the United States 
and Canada deSignated as 'worthy 
of financial support in graduate 
SChool,' according to the an-
nouncement by the foundation in 
Princeton, New Jersey. 

Princeton University was run-
ner-up to UC with 32 students 
so honored, followed by Cornell 
and Michigan Universities with 
27 each, Harvard with 24, and 
Wisconsin University with 20. 
The State University otNew York 
(SUNY) had 5 students listed. 

Fifteen regional faculty com-
mittees picked the winners from 
among 11 ,682 students nominated 
by their professors. Selection 
involved grades, letters of re-
commendation, a 1,000 word 
state ment on inte Uectual in-
terests, and interviews. 

This year, the foundation's se-
1ections are recommendations 
rather than cash awards, since 
the Ford Foundation has with-
drawn its direct grants. In the 
last 10 years, Ford had granted 
$52 million, allowing the Wilson 
Foundation to provide support 
to 1,000 students each year in 
their first year of graduate study. 

"Now our major role is to 
identify for graduate departments 
those students who in our view 
have the best potential for col-
lege teacbing," said Sir Hugh 
Taylor, president of the Founda-
tion. "This year's deSignates 

"Someday, 

are as distinguished and care-
fully selected a group as las t 
year's fellows. We hope aU ot 
them will r eceive assistance 
from the graduate schools or 
from federal or other fellowship 
programs. " 

The Ford Foundation is con-
tinuing its support of the re-
cruiting and selection procedures 
of the Wilson Foundation through 

an annual grant of $1.2 million 
which also provides for 50 first-
year graduate school fellowships 
for Canadians and up to 200 
Wilson dissertation fellowships 
annually. Out of funds from other 
sources, the Wilson Founda.tion 
expects to support 100 American 
students with direct grants.

University Saves Money 
University of California engi-

neering professors and students 
at Santa Barbara design and build 
their own wind tunnel, saving 
$11,000. The Davis campus saves 
$12,000 by leasing a Post Ollice 
box, and having Uncle Sam sor t 
the mail. The new San Diego 
Medical Scbool gets the local 
Medical Society to share its li-
brary and contr ibute new books 
and stafi, saving the campus 
$165,000 to begin with and $18,000 
a year afte r that. 

The San Diego Medical SOCiety 
had made available a tremendous 
bonanza to the Medical School, 
whic h takes in its first class 
next fall. The books , atthe Coun-
ty-University bospital, will be 
available to the medica.! students , 
inter ns and r es idents. 

Fellowships Go 
to Two UCSD 
Professors 

Sixteen UCSD students will be 
studying next year on campuses 
in Europe and Asia. They will 
be the third group trom San 
Diego sponsored by the Univer-
sity's Education Abroad Program 
now in its seventh year of opera-
tion. 

Those selected include: Bar-
bara Baily, Holly Harrison, Seo-
naid McArthur and Alex Ruiz 
(Bordeaux); Tom Disselhorst, 
Dan Georgi, Bill Rye and Bruce 
McArthur (Goettigen); Adele Wil-
keson (Madrid); Judith Roth 
(Jerusalem); Bill Urban (Padua); 
Roger Showley (Hong Kong); Dave 
Cole and Chris Bibb (Trinity 
College--Dublin); Dan Weinstein 
and Bob Dutlna (St. Andrew's--
Scotland); Martha salinas, Che-
lene Folin, Mark Waxman and 
Edith Whitlock, alternates. 

According to Ward Beecher, 
dean of International Education, 
advantages to be gained from 
such experience are largely in-
tangible. Students exposed to 
other cultures and viewpoints 
will become an asset to the Uni-
versity as they broaden their 
understanding. A large percen-
tage have expressed interest in 
foreign service or international 
business and others hope to add 
a new dimension to their major 
in a foreign language or litera-
ture. 

students are selected on the 
basis of grades, language pro-
ficiency and motivation. For the 
United Kingdom, a 3.0 GPA is 
required due to the stiff compe-
tition for places at their uni-
versities, while in other coun-
tries a 2.75 is sufficient. Ab1l1ty 
to converse in the native tongue 

is essential10r a student, unless 
he attends a bi-lingual university 
such as Hong Kong or Jerusalem. 
His experience has "no point 
without mixing with the people" 
Dean Beecher said. He also 
stressed the importance of the 
student' s motivation. 

Those interested in Education 
Abroad for next year should begin 
considering appropriate classes 
and exploring possibilities with 
the department of their major. 
As Dean Beecher suggested, "the 
well prepared are the most apt to 
be selected. 

Dean Beecher sums up the Edu-
catlon Abroad Program as "just 
a great experience universally". 
Evidence for this opinion is ex-
tensive and we wish those going 
next year good fortune in ex-
periencing it for themselves. 

The selection committee does 
not consider students' political 
views, nor are they looking for 
the "all-American boy or girl." 
They feel that fuUillment of the 
other criteria indicates a seri-
ousness of purpose which would 
not convey the shallowness Euro-
peans and Asians almost expect 
of Americans. This is important 
since a student becomes an au-
thority on the United states as 
soon as he steps off the boat 
or plane, says Dean Beecher, 
and must expect to answer a 
variety of questions. 

The obvious answer to "what 
do you expect to gain from your 
study abroad" is simply the ex-
perience itself. However, stu-
dents aiso have particular ex-
pectations and motives. 

These and 212 other economies 
were reported today for all oper-
ating levels at the Univer sity of 
California during the last three 
months of 1967. They represent 
tbe first fruits of UC President 
Charles J . Hitch's intens ified 
economy program launched las t 
October, and the totals are en-
couraging-- they represent sav-
ings of more than $3 million. 

Two UCSD professors have 
been awarded research fellow-
ships by the National Endowment 
for the Humanities, a Federal 
agency authorized to promote 
scholarship, research and public 
understanding of the humanities 
in the U nUed States. 

Boskin's Aijlity 
The effort is part of the cam-

paign at UC to obtain maximum 
res ults from the money it man-
ages , while making sure that the 
QUality of education does not 
suffer in the face of betty cuts 
in its oper ating and construction 
budgets . 

They are: Dr. James T. Mon-
r oe, Assistant Professor of Span-
ish and Arabic Literature, who 
was awarded a Fellowship for 
Younger Scholars; and Dr. Ed-
win F. Dolin, Ass istant Profes-
sor of Classical and Compara-
tive Literature, who was award-
ed a summer s tipend. 

Wins Student Support 

Finally, the economy program 
has had gratifying results at 
the nine campuses . 

These economies are in ad-
dition to 64 examples compiled 
last Septe mber as illustration of 
'N~t might be done. The econo-
mies r eported range from the lit-
tle things, such as reusing old 
file folders , to major decisions , 
such as reducing the size of a 
main utility tunnel by direct bur-
ial of chUled water pipes, saving 
$290,000. Each economy is re-
ported to all othe r campuses. 

Dr . Monroe and his wUe will 
travel to Madrid, Spain, where 
he will work on Medieval His-
pano-Arabic poetry. At the same 
time, Mrs . Monroe, a graduate 
s tudent in Spanish Literature at 
UCSD. will be writing her Ph. D. 
thesis on the Spanish Ballads. 

Dr. Dolin, his wUe and two chil-
dren will s pend the summer at 
Yale University where he will 
do research on the role ambi-
guity in the language of Greek 
tragedy.

A petition calling for recoll-
struction of a coll~ ge faculty 
committee's refusal to hire 
Dr. Joseph Boskin was initiated 
in his History 36 class at the 
last lecture of tbe Winter 
Quarter. 

B"oskin, a professor of history 
at the Univers ity of Southern 
California, has been a visiting 
lecturer at Revelle CoUege tor 
two quarters. His well-attended 
lectures on American history had 
prompted consideration of mak-
ing him a lull professor at UCSD. 

Marel Leeds, a Junior Biology 
major and History minor, is cir-
culating the petition because she 
feels "we need excellent profes-
sors who are in tune with the 
happenings today, and I think 
UCSD would miss a great chance 
of obtaining an historian if Dr. 
Boskin is not hired." 

Leeds said that Boskin's lack 
of the sufficient number of pub-
lished works was the cause for 
denial of a professorship. 

"I don't think that the 'publish 
or perish' policy of the Univer-
sity is the que s tion," she said. 
Boskin later said tbat he had 
only published one instead of the 
two required number of books , 
and about half of the required 
number of articles. 

Boskin said he had been turned 
down from a professorship at 
UC LA for the same reasons- -
not enough publications. 

Leeds announced that a table 
wouJ.1 be set up in Revelle Piaza 
to obtain more than 175 sig-
natures collected at the lecture. 
The purpos e of the petition, she 
said, would be to demonstrate 

,to the facul t.y that ·UCSD needs 
Joseph Boskin.· 

Return questionnaire to AS Office (250 Matthews CamplJs ) or Ann The petition provides for sig-
Conklin's oUice (1st floor Argo) natures 01 students who, "al-
'--_______________________ ..... though not familiar with the in-

structlon of Dr. Boskin, are truly 
impressed by the zeal expressed 
by his students." 

The petition reads as follows: 
L We, the undersigned, present 

and former students of Dr. Joseph 
Boskin, visiting professor from 
USC, wish to bring an important 
matter to the attention of the Re-
velle College administration. 
From personal observation, we 
feel that Dr. Boskin is an ex-
cellent and enthusiastic instruc-
tor, with meaningful and impor-
tant things to say about our 
American history. Each of us 
was eagerly awaiting the appoint-
ment of Dr. Boskin to the faculty 
here. Shock was our reaction, 
when we found that Dr. Boskin 
had been rejected because of the 
"publish or perish" policy of 
this administration. Although we 
are not prepared to argue the 
merits or worthlessness of such 
a policy, we do know that the ac-
ceptance of Dr. Boskin to the 
UCSD staff would, in every way, 
correspond to the academic ex-
cellence the administration at-
tempts to maintain. 

Therefore, we are asking the 
appointment committees of the 
Revelle, Muir, and Third College 
to reconsider the case of Dr. 
Boskin, because the non-accep-
tance of such a floe professor 
would be a deep loss to our cam-
pus. 

II. We, the undersigned, al-
though not familiar with tt~ in-
s truction of Dr. Boskin, are truly 
impressed by the zeal expressed 
by his students. We feel that if a 
professor can generate such a 
universal feeling among his stu-
dents, he must be an excellent 
professor. 

Therefore, we, too, request a 
reconsideration of Dr. Boskin's 
appointment to the faculty of one 
of UCSD's colleges. 

Bill Rye's interest in inter-
national business will prompt him 
to take classes in business theory 
at Goettingen. He also hopes to 
see how Ger,man history is por-
trayed from the German view-
point. Between the five-month 
school terms is a two-month 
break in February, and Rye, like 
most of the othe rs, plans to 
travel. 

At the University of Bordeaux, 
Barbie Baily will be taking 
French literature, while Seonaid 
McA'fthur plans to study art, in 
the midst of the sources of the 
culture which we usually can 
receive only secondhand. 

Chris Bibb has only recently 
learned that she is to attend 
Trinity College and is realizing 
that Ireland is more thananother 
English speaking country. She 
believes she will enjoy its un-
discovered quality and easy-
going, slower paced ways, and 
hopes that her support of Nixon 
in the presidential contest will 
not produce any awkward situa-
tions in the fiercely proud home-
land of the Kennedys. 

Judy Roth worked last summer 
as a volunteer on a "kibbutzm", 
allowing a regular worker to 
fight in Isreal's army. She fell 
in love with the country and is 
looking forward to being one of 
the first group of foreign s tu-
dents to attend the University 
of Jerusalem. 

Roger Showley, who will attend 
the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong, emphasized the importance 
of fitting in with the natives of 
the country. It is not a QUestion 
of conforming, but as Dean 
Beecher said, "of being sensitive 
enough not to offend" the people 
·whose customs and habits differ 
from ours. The Chinese are con-
servative dressers and loud or 
bright colors would seem unusual 
to them. Show ley is obtaining 
heiP from foreign students on our 
campus concerning language and 
environment. 

Decisions about clothes will 
not be a problem for those at 
st. Andrew's in Scotland. All 
students must wear red robes 
to lectures, church and cere-
mOnies, which will certainly re-
quire an adjustment from the 
typical attire on tbe UCSD cam-
pus. 

Seiter and Ca ry 
Earn Wi/son 
Recommendation 

Two University of Cal1fornia 
at San , Diego seniors have been 
named as "among the best future 
college teacher prospects in the 
United States and Canada" by the 
Woodrow Wilson National Fellow-
shiP Foundation, it was announced 
today. 

They are Frank J. Seiter, an 
economics major, who was named 
a Woodrow Wilson Designate, and 
Paul R. Cary, a chemistry major 
who was named to the honorable 
mention list. They are among 2,100 
college seniors at 309 colleges 
and universities in the United 
states and Canada who have been 
deemed "worthy of finanCial sup-
port in graduate school" by the 
foundation. 

"Now our major role is to 
identify for graduate departments 
those students who in our view 
have the best potential for college 
teaching," said Sir Hugh Taylor, 
president of the foundation. "This 
year's DeSignates are as distin-
'guished and carefully selected a 
group as last year's Fellows. We 
hope all of them will receive as-
sistance from the graduate schools 
or from lederal or other fellow-
ship programs."

Vive la France! 
By Katby Benson and Cathy' Merrill 

Cheap hotels are easy to find in Paris. Upon your arrival in town, 
take the metro, Direction Porte D'Orleans, and get off at st. Michel. 
Now you're on the lett bank. In that area, aroWld the Sorbonne, Alliance 
Francaise and Centre American for etudiants et Aristes, you can 
take your pick of low priced (less than .$2.oo a night) hotel rooms and 
student foyers. 

Highly recommended is the Namur Hotel, 39 Delambre, where a 
double room can be obtained for 11 francs a night ($2.80). Also, the 
Hotel des BainS, 33 Rue Delambre, has rooms for the same price. 
We found the Four Nations Hotel at 29 Rue Mazarin has double rooms 
also for 11 francs. $2.20 a night for a double rooms is about the cheapest 
available--most hotels in the left bank area, Uyou carefully avoid those 
catering to tourists, which have expensively furnished entrances that 
earnestly proclaim "EngUsh Spoken Here" ($$). 

Few low budget hotels will accept reservations, either by mail or 
by telephone; so just appear in the concierge's oUice early in tbe 
morning and she should be able to give you a room for that night. 
Don't bring much luggage, because, during the summer, hoteis are 
crowded and you most certainly will have to try severai hotels and 
that involves a lot of walking. Also, the metro is cheap here, while 
taxis are outrageoulsy expensive. 

Most girls who need a lot of luggage invest in small traveling wheels 
which convert big heavy suitcases into easy-to-pull carts--that's 
absolute necessity for any girl with a heavy suitcase, as Pariesien 
men are not at all chivalrous and rarely ofier to help giris. 

Schools here are easy to get into. All you do is pre~ent yourself 
in the office within a month of the first day of class, and you can 
sign up for any class. The Sorbonne is on the semeste.r system: 
November to January, February to June. There is also ,a summer 
program. Fees run from $50 to $70, depending on the intensity of your 
language. ] (Kathy Benson) paid $50 for lectures and 6 bours a week 
"cours pratique." Cathy (Merrill) paid $66 lor 12 hours cours pra-
tiques and the lectures. These lectures encompass French culture, 
iTom art and history to current politics. 

The Alliance Francaise charges $11 a month for language classes, 
but this school has not been recommended by other American Paris ians. 
The Institut Cathollque, near Alliance Francaise, charges the same, 
but has been recommended as good language instruction. The Sorbonne 
is by far the best. It provides social activities, a family-placement 
service, and an advisor, while it still has the largest enrollment 
and most attractive campus. The amphitheatre Richilleu, where you 
would attend lectures, is considered a tourist attractio,n--and the 
Sorbonne buildings are decorated with paintings by famous French 
artists!

A S Senate Notes 
By Roger Showley, News Editor 

In its first meeting of tbe Spring Quarter, the Senate resolved the 
Triton Times Flag Contest, revealed plans for a Constitutional Com-
mittee, and announced some of the events of the Spring Quarter. 

For those of you who entered the Flag Contest, the Senate finally 
decided to hand over the deCision to the student body at the April 24 
Elections. Four finalists were chosen (see accompanying photograph), 
and they will be displayed around the school until the election. 

Herv Sweetwood said that the proposed constitutional committee 
would delve into reforms in AS government, since "the present system 
is useless except fo~ providing entertainment." He said more should 
be done in the way of academic and nonsocial problems faCing students 
on campus. Dean Topolovac has suggested a system in which chairmen 
would be elective to serve on committees dealing with educational 
reforms, the drug problem, and traditional student government topics. 

Gary Curtis told the Senate that the "Peanut Butter Conspiracy" 
will play at UCSD a weekfrom tomorrow night (April 13) on a no-charge-
to-Tritons basis. There wU( be a rousing beach party on May 20 
with a food fight and on May 17, Cal Tjader will open up the 3000-
seat gym with a concert. Unfortunately those rumors about Pat 
Paulsen never became fact. 

Sometime this quarter, Sweetwood said, there will be a seminar 
concerned with the Draft. The Chancellor and Provosts are all excited 
about the possibility of getting big names on campus, and the possibly 
two-day affair would mean a suspension of classes to allow aU students 
to partiCipate. Campus organizations would be asked to submit ideas 
for speakers. The idea of the conference, the vice-president explained, 
is to involve the whole University community in problems facing 
us today. Out of such multUaceted dialogues would come better 
re latlonships between facu Ity, students, and staff. 

Wednesday Dean Topolovac called a Spiritual Revival meeting to 
discuss school spirit. In tbe works are a Homecoming, cheerleader 
tryouts, and a pep raUy.

Theatre Formed 
At UCSD 
" '.'Man can no longer hide be-

hind a role. It is essential for 
theater- -and life, too, I might 
add- -that we come forth and be 
visible to one another. . . . 
Learning how to play together 
makes this probable and pos-
sible." 

These words of Viola Spolin, 
founder and for five years di-
rector of Chicago' s "Second 
City" improvisatory theater hold 
out, I believe, promise for cor-
recting what until now has been 
a sad iack of outlet for both the 
spontaneous expression of s tu-
dent creativity and an institution-
al opportunity for student inter-
action. Although i am neither a 
professional actor nor director, 
I am interested in seeing that 
such an outlet be provided, and 
I believe that if any of the rest 
of you leel as 1 do, together we 
can create not only an environ-
ment for the stimulation of ar-
tistic expression but , per haps 
even more impor tant , an atmos-
phere for human growth. Lofty 
phrases, however, sould not be 
taken to !Rdicate that ot.;t:ctives 
like those mentioned above, im-
portant though they be, eliminate 
the possibility of having fun, 
for neithe r theater nor life ought 
to be too solemn. 

Wboeve r is interested in apro-
ject of this sor t is invited to an

Cofiee House on campus at 2:00 
p.m. tomorrow, Satu rday, April

Fore~gn Film 
Ranks High by Bev Barni se Triton Times Society Writer 

by Dave Sacherman 
Times Film Critic 

Under the warm sun of a lush 
19th century Scandinavian coun-
tryside a lovely young girl chases 
butterflies and shares berries ' 
with her young lover. This is 
the setting of the Swedish movie 
"Elvira Madigan", anexception-
al film in both story and photo-
graphy. 

The film relates the true story 
of a runaway love affair of a 
young t1ghtrope dancer, Elvira 
Madigan, and a married cavalry 
officer, Sixten Sparre. Both char-
acters are portrayed excellently 
by Thommy Berggren and a de-
licious new talent named Pia 
Degermark.

The All-Cal weekend in Heav-
enly Valley was really great 
according to people who attended. 
There were more than 800 Cal 
students there with Davis repre-
sented by more than 400. Thirty 
from UCSD were among the ski 
enthusiasts. 

Acceptances for the Cal study 
abroad program have been com-
ing in from Santa Barbara. Roger 
Shawley will be studying next 
year in Chlna and Bill Urban 
will spend the year in Italy. 

John Slaybaugh, coach for the 
rowing crew, held a party for 
crew members to reward them 
for their workout during vaca-
tion. They rowed over 100 miles 
and were reportedly much im-
proved. Who is Martin Chisel-
witz? 

Travelers to Mexico this vaca-
tion lncluded John LaGrange, 
Brian Lawson and Pete Baumann. 

Dave Stearns celebrated his 
birthday durIng vacation. Dave 
must be a great driver because 
the birthday cake that Holly had 
baked for him ar rived split level-
ed Instead of double layered. 

More birthday notes include 

Michael Foggiano who turned 21 
during vacation. His celebrating 
had to be postponed because of 
strictly enforced crew training 
rules. Cathy Topping turned 21 
on March 25, Marg Van Valken-
burg turned 20 on March 29, 
Uti Schoettle turned 20 on April 
Fool's Day (as did the Society 
Editor --Editor's Note), and 
Roger Showley will be 20 on 
April 8. 

You just can't go anywhere 
without running into people from 
UCSD. Mike Branch took in Guess 
Who's Coming to DlnnerandJohn 
Shoven sat through the double 
feature of Blowup and The Loved 
One. 

UCSD night at Mickie Finn's 
was a good way to start the 
quarter . The evening featured two . 
of Finn's regular shows. 

Another engagement announce-
ment is that of Melodie H1lls 
and Mike O'Rourke. 

Spring quarter is 'beach quar-
ter' but sophomores with many 
hours of labs will have to forget 
that slogan for this year. It seems 
as if labs are always in the 
afternoons! 

The lovers nee Sweden where 
Sparre has left his regiment. 
Tlleir idyllic existence of picnic, 
dance, and love-making is soon 
shattered as their financial re-
sources are drained and they are 
frequently forced to flight by 
their care lessness in concealin( 
their identities. Nature turns in-
different and a tragic end is 
inevitable but quite appropriate 
for two who have experienced so 
perfect a love. 

The film is sensitive, simple, 
and poignant. The atmosphere of 
the theme is conveyed both by 
the expert photography and by the 
musical score which is Mozart's 
Piano Concerto No. 21 . As one 
of the two outstanding foreign 
films oC this year, "Elvira Madi-
gan" is the ultimate in lyrical 
romanticism. 

Photographs by Harry Callahan 
and selections from the per-
manent collection of La Jolla Mu-
seum of Art are two current ex-
hibitions now in museum gal-
leries at 700 Prospect Street . 

On exhibit from the museum 
collection are primitive sculp-
ture and objects as well as draw-
ings , paintings and graphics by 
20th century artists. The works 
all are based on variations oUhe 
human figure. 

Among the primitive figures on 
display are a clay family group 
from the pre- Columbian Mexico 
and two disc-headed fertility 
dolls from the Ashanti tribe of 
Africa. 

Nearly 140 black and white 
photographs by American pboto-
grapher-teacher Harry Callahan 
are on exhibit in two secondfioor 
galleries. 

The photographs, many of them 
small, were personally selected 
by the photographer. The collec-
tion is on loan from the Hall-
mark gallery in New York where 
the exhibit premiered in 1964.

Note: Due to technical errors 
last issue, the criticism of ''In 
Cold Blood" gave the reader a 
somewhat false impression of

welldone, was dark, depressing, 
often uninteresting, and perhaps 
too grim and ghastly.

Callahan has been called one of

in collections in this country and 
abroad. He has been included in 
exhibitions at the Museum of Mo-

Assembly Speaker Jesse M. 
Unruh today released the com-
pleted progress report of the 
Legislature's Joint Committee 
on Higher Education. The report 
restates the Committee's op-
position to the establishment oC 
tuition or greatly increased stu-
dent charges at the University of 
California and the state colleges 
at the present time, and presents 
tactual information which led the 
Committee to adopt its position. 

The report also identiCies sev-
eral other matters which the 
Committee will focus upon in 
preparing its final report to the 
Legislature in 1969. These areas 
include student aid, access to 
higher education for students 
from minority groups and low-
income Camilies, the possibility 
of state aid for private colleges 
and universities and the need for 
a complete restructurlng of the 
public systems of higher educa-
tion in CalUornia. 

A major section of the report 
is devoted to an analysis of the 
trends in enrollment, student a-
chievement and finance among 
the public and private institutions 
since the years just prior to the 
1960 Master Plan survey. The 
report Indicates that the 123 pub-
lic and private colleges and uni-
versities in CalUornia which en-
rolled some 393,000 individual 
students 10 years ago, have grown 
to more than 150 institutions en-
rolling in excess of 826,000 part-
time and Cull- time students. Total Sponsored by the Southern Cal-

ifornia chapter of the American 
stamp Dealers Association 
(ASDA), with prizes contributed 
by the First Western Bank, the 
contest is part of the activities 
centered around the International 
Stamp Exhibition, known as 
ASDA-WEST 1968, to be held at 
tbe Statler Hilton Hote I, Los 
Angeles, May 2-5. Winnlng en-
tries wlll be displayed at the 
exhibition and, prior to then, at 
the First Western Bank, Sixth 
and Flower streets.

Triton Times Music Critic 

Carol Rosenberger, an Ameri-
can pianist who has recently ap-
peared with seve ral oC the coun-
try's leading orchestras, gave a 
fair concert last Sunday on cam-
pus. She performed a program 
of varied musicalCare which con-
sis ted of three pieces oC Rameau, 
the late E major Sonata of Bee-
thoven, two Nocturnes oC Gabriel 
Faure, four Pre ludes from Rach-
maninofC's Opus 32, and Scria-
bin's Sonata No.5. 

Her two major drawbacks were 
a lack of finger control and a 
lack of contrasting dynamics. 
The complex ornamentation of 
Rameau were correctly inter-
preted, but her lack oC cuntrol 
in several mordants and trills 
failed to give Rameau that air 
of elegance that Is essential in 
Le Rappel des Oiseaux (Tbe call 
of the birds) and Les Nlais de 
Sologne (The clever ones). 

The first two short movements 
oC the Beethoven Sonata were 
very well executed. Miss Rosen-
berger excels in fast passages. 

However, the Andante wasplayed 
too languidly. The supreme suf-
Cering didn't come through, al-
though this is very hard to do. 

Her lack oC contrast was most 
apparent in the Faure Nocturnes. 
Her interpretation was very neb-
ulous and thus the spark and 
Cire which is so characteristic 
of most of Faure's impression-
ism. 

The Rachmaninoff was cut and 
dry, and was played much too 
loudly. She used altogethe r too 
much pedal, and this created a 
smear in several sections. 

The Scriabin Sonata was very 
well played. It's iUl extremely 
complex work and quite difficult 
to interpret. Carol Rosenberger 
managed to get the "mystical" 
aura which surrounds the Sonata. 
But again, the dynamics were 
all at about the same level and 
Scriabin suffered. 

In short, Rosenberger lacks 
the basic sensitivity to pianistic 
shadings which separate great 
pianists from good ones. 

111 umCORil TIIaIre · NOW PLAYING 

enrollment has grown from 3 
percent oC total civilian popula-
tion to about 4.7 percent and is 
expected to rise to 5.5 percent 
by 1972, when the total number 
of individuals enrolled will reach 
1,200,000. 

The Committee found that Cali-
fornia's college attendance rates 
exceed those for the rest of the 
nation at every age bracket, yet 
there is also a very high rate 
of attrition among California's 
students, especially during the 
freshman and sophomore years, 
and the dropout rate appears to 
be getting worse . 

The report also suggests the 
possibility of revising the Con-
stitution as a means of effecting 
significant changes in the organi-
zation and governance of public 

higher eduation. Taking note of 
the "barriers" which have been 
erected between the University, 
the state colleges and the Junior 
colleges in their competition for 
money, faculty, students and fa-
cilities, the Committee suggests 
that in order to carry out the 
intent of the Master Plan it 
may be necessary to end the 
present "tripartite" system and 
move toward a single statewide 
system of public higher educa-
tion. 

One way ot doing this, ac-
cording to the report, would be 
to organize the statewide system 
on a regional basis with a close 
planning and operating relation-
ship between the junior colleges, 
state colleges and university cen-
ters in each region.

Nixon Socks It To 'em 
Editor-'s Note: This 

speech by Republican 
Richard Nixon is the 
first in a series of 
articles dealing with 
candidates for the 
presidency. Next week 
we hope to present a 
comvarable article by 
Rob~rt Kennedy. 

In the course of this year's 
Presidental campaign, I will be 
discussing with the American 
people many issues -- what I 
see as the nation's needs and 
its strengths; its problems ane! 
its purposes; the dangers we 
face, and the opportunities that 
are ours to seize and the number 
one issue in the world. 

This is the problem of order. 
By order I mean peace at home, 

and peace in the world. I mean 
the containing of violence, whe-
ther by armies or by mobs or 
by individuals. I mean the essen-
tial stabIlity, the decent regard 
for the rights of others, that 
makes lite liveable and progress 
possible. 

It was more than a quarter-
century ago that President 
Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed 
"freedom from fear" as one of 
the Four Freedoms. And yet 
today, fear stalks our lives as 
never before. 

There are many kinds of fear 
today -- fear of the loss of In-
dividuality. fear of human obso-
lescence, fear of economic dep-
rivation -- but the central fear 
is the most primitive -- the 
fear of physical violence. 

We live today at a time of 
deep and fundamental question-
ing, when millions of Americans 
are asking whether their country 
can survive, and whether their 
world w1ll survive. Both abroad 
and at home, the forces of des-
truction threaten our lives and 
our institutions. 

Here at home , we have been 
amply warned that we face the 
prospect of a war-In-the-makIng 
in our own society. We have 
seen the gathering hate, we have 
heard the threats to burn and 
bomb and destroy. In Walts and 
Harlem and Detriot and Newark, 
we have had a foretaste of what 
the organizers of insurrection 

r t.16 
BRWIk}G 
ABOJT AIR" 
(J.lA.TE~ NJD 

are planning for the summers 
ahead. The President·s National 
Advisory Committee on Civil 
Disorders now cautions tbe "in 
the summer 1967. we have seen 
in our ciUes a chain reaction 
of racial violence. If we are 
heedless none of us shall escape 
the consequences." 

Abroad, we have lived for a 
generation with the abrasoveten-
sions of the cold war, with the 
threat of nuclear weapons, with 
the explosive instabilities of a 
rapid dismantlIng of the old co-
lonial empires. We have fought 
World War II. Korea, Viet Nam, 
and the peace is still elusive. 
Still we live in a world in which 
tyranny and greed and fanati-
cism march behInd the barrels 
of guns. Are we, then, to be 
divided forever into warring 
worlds? 

And here at home, are we to 
become two nations. one black, 
one white, poised for irrepres-
sible conflict? 

On both counts, the answer is 
no. But we cannot have peace 
abroad by wishIng for it. And we 
cannot heal the wounds of our 
nation either by blind repression 
or by an equally blind permis-
siveness. 

We live today at a time of deep 
and fundamental questioning, 
when millions of Americans are 
askIng whether their country can 
survive, and whether their world 
will survive. Both abroad and at 
home, the forces of destruction 
threaten our lives and our in-
stitutions. 

Here at home, we have been 
amply warned that we face the 
prospect of a war-in-the-making 
in our own SOCiety. We have seen 
the gatbering hate, we have heard 
the tbreats to burn and bomb and 
destroy. In Watts and Harlem 
and Detroit and Newark , we have 
had a foretaste of what the or-
ganizers of insurrection are 
plannIng for the summers ahead. 
The President's National Advis-
ory Commission on Civil Dis-
orders now cautions that "in the 
summer of 1967, we have seen 
in our cities a chain reaction of 
racial violence. If we are heed-
less none of us shall escape the 
consequences." 

Abroad, we have lived (or a 
generation with the abrasive ten-
sions of tbe cold war, with the

threat of nuclear weapons, with 
the explosive instabilities of a 
rapid dismantlIng of the old col-
onial empires. We have fought 
World War II, Korea. Viet Nam, 

and the peace is still elusive. 
Still we live in a world in wbich 
tyranny and greed and fanaticism 
march behind the barrels of guns. 
Are we, then, to be divided for-
ever into warring worlds? 

And here at home, are we to 
become two nations, one black, 
one wbite, poised for irrepres-
sible conflict? 

On both counts, the answer 
is lIo. But we cannot have peace 
abroad by wlshing for it. And 
we cannot heal the wounds of 
our nation either by blind repres-
sion or by an equally blind per-
missiveness. 
Peace in Participation 

The peace we want in our 
cities is not the illusory peace 
of an abdication of authority, 
and not the sullen peace of the 
disspirited, but the peace that 
springs from participation--par-
ticipation in the processes of 
growth and cbange, in the ex-
citement of the present and the 
promise of the future. 

As they survey the prospects 
of our cities. some cry out in 
despair that all is lost, that 
nothing can be done, that The 
Fire Next Time already is lick-
ing at the window-sills. Even 
President Jobnson said not long 

ago that "we will have a bad 
summer ," and "we will have , 
several bad summers before the 
deficiencies of centuries are e-
rased." 

This is not a time for Polly-
annas, but neither is it a time 
to throw up our bands in help-
lessness. Violence in a kree so-
ciety is never Inevitable--unless 
we accept its Inevitability. 

LBJ's Masquerade 
The war in Viet Nam is a 

brutal war, and a terrible war, 
as all wars are brutal and ter-
rible. It has cost us heavily in 
lives, in dollars, in hostility 
abroad lUId division at home--in 
part because of the Administra-
tion's failure convincingly to 
strip away its masquerade. But 
the men dying there are dying 
for a cause fundamental to man's 

Feiffer 

hope: the cause of checking ag-
greSSion, of checking violence. 
and of moving us one step closer 
along the dtlOcult road to a 
lasting peace. 

I have long been a vigorous 
critic of the conduct of that war. 
Our military power has been frit-
tered away In a misguided pollcy 
of gradualism; if we had used 
our power quickly, we could have 
ended it with far less than we 
are now using. 

The Administration's failure 
to inform the American people 
of the full costs of the war--its 
failure to take tbe people fully 
into its confidence on the war--
has sown distrust and suspicion 
about the war, both here and 
abroad. 

But even more fundamentally, 
the Administration has failed to 
understand tbe nature of this 
new kind of war. This is dif-
ferent from other wars, and far 
more complex. It is a war for 
people, not for territory, and it 
cannot be won by miUtary means 
alone. 

Failure to Use Russia 
Because of its failure of un-

derstanding, the Administration 
has failed to press those non-
military measures--diplomatic, 
economiC, psychological, poUti-
cal--that could have vastly in-
creased the effectiveness of the 
military effort. It has failed to 
use diplomacy effectively with the 
Soviet Union, to enlist the Soviets 
on the side of peace. It has failed 
to do enough to enlist the South 
Vietnamese fully in their struggle 
--enough to train their mllltary, 
and enough to give their people 
the hope, the stake in the future, 
the spirit of independence, that 
are needed if they are to have 
something to fight for, as well 
as against. 

Only when our political, eco-
monic and diplomatic efforts are 
given a priority equal to our 
military effort will tbis war be 
brought to a successful con-
clusion. 

Only this way can we get the 
negotiated end of the war that 
we want--not a military victory 
in the conve ntional sense, not 
unconditional surrender by the 
other side, but a durable peace 
in which the right of self-deter-

mlnation of the South Vietnamese 
people is respected by aU nations 
including North Vietnam. 

I think that with different po-
Ucies the war could have been 
ended before this. I think that 
with new policies it could be 
ended sooner -- though not as 
quickly or as cheaply as if those 
pOlicies had been adopted when 
they should have been. 
Need Peace in Pacific 
It is essential that we end thls 

war, and end it quickly. But it 
is essential that we end it in such 
a way that we win the peace. And 
just as the cause we are kighting 

,for is larger than Viet Nam, 
the peace we must be concerned 
with is larger than VietNam. The 
peace we must be concerned witb 
is peace in the Pacific for the 
balance of this century. But Viet 
Nam alone will not secure that 
peace. It requires a preventive 
dIplomacy, designed to concert 
the rapIdly growing strengths of 
the Asian nations themselves. 

As we look to the future, we 
must establish conditions in 
which, when others are threaten-
ed, we help if needed--but we 
help them fight the warforthem-
selves, rather than fighting the 
war tor them. This means that 
the other nations in the path of 
potential aggression must pre-
pare to take their own measures, 
both individually and collectively, 
to contain the aggressor. They 
must not be allowed to suppose 
that they can continue indefinite-
ly to count on the United States 
for go- it alone protection. 

This is not a retreat from 
responsibility, and not a new 
Isolationism. It recognizes three 
tundamentallacts; 

First, that the job of keepIng 
the peace is too large for the 
United States alone; 

Second, that among nations as 
among individuals, self-reliance 
is the foundation of pride and 
the cornerstone of progress; 

And, third, that by establishing 
new collective security systems, 
the total effective strength of the 
free world will be increased, 
and thus the Communist powers' 
temptation to launch new wars 
will be reduced. 

We as a nation must still do 
our share, but others must do 
their share, too.

one and trophies for top three 
contestants. It is recommended 
that participants bring strong 
flashUgilts and a full tank. The 
rallye promises to be a really 
great one. Enter and find out 
new places to stop and watch 
the submarine races. 

LAST FALL THE TRITON TIMES 
announced the beginning of the 
tutorial project of the newly 
formed UCSD Social Services 
Committee. Since then, an aver-
age of twenty-five UCSD students 
have been tutoring once a week 
at anyone of three neighborhood 
centers in the southeast area of 
San Diego. The main emphasis 
has been on individual tutoring 
with students of all grade levels. 
A few students have also been 
involved in such activities as 
homemaking or art classes, or 
a field trip to the zoo. The 
project has been hampered thus 
far by a lack of funds to pay for 
transportation and other ex-
penses, but these have now ar-
rived. The committee has al-
ready received a grant of $400 

' in Regents' funds for next year. 
New tutors for this quarter are 
welcome. Anyone who wants to 
participate should contact either 
Terry Reedy, 453-4469, or John 
Nuber, 453-3930.
