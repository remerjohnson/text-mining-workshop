After years of financial strife, the newly 
renovated Grove Cafe opened its doors again 
last week, offering free lunch to over 2,200 
UCSD students in an attempt to recruit future 
business for the struggling cafe.

The Grove, an A.S. enterprise, hosted a 
four-day free lunch event that took place from 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday through Friday. 
Despite the drizzly weather, thousands of stu-
dents waited in line to receive a free sandwich 
or personal pizza. 

According to Vice President of Finances 

and Resources Peter Benesch, an estimated 
$6,000 was spent on the promotion event, 
including ingredients and advertising.

Associate Vice President of Enterprise 
Operations Rishi Ghosh called the kickoff a 
“smashing success.”

“We have captured a huge chunk of campus 
awareness about the Grove, and that has been 
our main goal,” Ghosh said. 

The Grove opened in 1986 as part of the 
Crafts Center — run by director Ron Carlson 
— and used its status as the only coffee shop on 
campus to keep students coming back.

In 1993, however, the Student Center venue 
began losing business to the brand-new Price 

Center, sinking the cafe into debt and forcing 
Carlson to sell his 50-percent share to the A.S. 
Council in 2007.

When profits continued to drop under stu-
dent management, the council decided to hire a 
professional manager for $50,000 a year.

Benesch said this decision was the main 
contributor to the Grove’s current $140,000 
debt. 

“The only reason the Grove was bleeding 
money the last two years was because of the 
manager’s salary,” Benesch said. “We could not 
support a $50,000-a-year position. It was a poor, 

The Grove Cafe celebrated its reopening in the Student Center all last week, serving free lunch to over 2,200 students.

A new set of media guidelines would handcuff student
publications to university departments — and
neither side is ready to commit.
By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin
News Editor

The A.S. Council’s Wednesday meeting 
will have a few extra visitors this week, when 
representatives from student publications — 
including the Muir Quarterly, the Koala and 
Mania Magazine — will turn out to protest the 
passage of new “media guidelines” that would 
require each publication to be sponsored by a 
university representative.

According to A.S. Director of Media 
Relations Rose Eveleth, student organizations 
are concerned that the proposal would restrict 
the growth of new magazines and newspapers 
across campus, and that the introduction of 
mandatory staff oversight could pose a serious 
threat to free speech.

Organizations Andrew Ang, who began draft-

Students applying for freshman admission to one 
or more UC campuses in Fall 2010 will be the first to 
face a new waitlisting procedure.

The university is planning to implement waitlists 
for admission, in hopes of curbing overenrollment. 
Waitlisted students will be notified in March, and the 
final admission decision will arrive after May 1. 

According to Debora Obley, associate vice presi-
dent for budget operations in the UC 
Office of the President, the UC system 
currently contains about 200,000 stu-
dents, and is overenrolled by approxi-
mately 15,000 — increasing the student-
faculty ratio and straining resources. 

Obley said the university received $4 
billion in state funding for the 2009-10 academic year, 
the same amount available in 2006-07, despite growing 
demand. 

“In 2006-07, we had about 20,000 fewer students,” 
Obley said. “And at that time, we thought we were 
underfunded.”

Director of Undergraduate Admissions Susan 
Wilbur said that by placing students on the waitlist 
instead of offering them admission, there is a reduced 
chance of having a high yield rate, which leads to 
overenrollment.

“We expect that UC campuses will admit a suf-
ficient number of applicants to reach their enrollment 
targets, but [the] yield is not always predictable,” 
Wilbur said. “Let’s say, for example, that a campus 
comes up short of its target. A waitlist allows the 
campus to offer a place to additional students in a 
controlled way — that is, to an appropriate number of

Researchers from UCSD and the 
National Institutes of Health have 
discovered a protein that could help 
treat hearing impairments. 

The protein, called Sox2, is 
critical in the formation of spinal 
ganglion neurons — the auditory 
neurons mammals use to hear.

The leading cause of acquired 
hearing impairment in the ear is 
either the loss of hair cells in the 
inner ear or spiral ganglion neurons.

Dr. Alain Dabdoub, an assis-
tant professor of surgery at UCSD, 
helped conduct a two-year study 
using the Sox2 protein to create 
these spiral ganglion neurons in 

the ear tissue of mice. The study 
was recently published in the 
Jan. 13 issue of The Journal of 
Neuroscience.

Researchers removed developing 
ear tissue from mouse embryos and 
studied the effects of injecting the 
cells with the Sox2 protein.  

They used immunohistochem-
istry — a procedure that stains 
proteins using visual markers such 
as fluorescent dye — to differentiate 
the Sox2 protein, then introduced 
the protein to the ear cells through 
infection (a process known as elec-
troporation).  

According to 
Dabdoub, within two 
days of mixing the 
cochlear and Sox2 pro-
teins together, the cells 
that were injected with 
the Sox2 gene devel-
oped into neurons and 
survived for up to two 
weeks. In contrast, cells 
that were not injected 

with the Sox2 gene did not become 
neurons.

“Utilizing genetics, we showed 
that Sox2 is necessary for the for-
mation of spiral ganglion neurons, 
as these neurons are absent in Sox2 
mutant mice — revealing a novel 
role for Sox2 in ear development,” 
Dabdoub said. 

Currently, the most common 
therapies for hearing loss are hearing 
aids — which essentially increase 
hair-cell stimulation — or cochlear 
implants that act as an electronic 
substitute for the hair cells.

In both forms of treatment, nor-

mal spiral ganglion neurons must be 
intact for the treatment to be effec-
tive. For this reason, this discovery 
that Sox2 proteins create new nerves 
is promising for future advance-
ments in hearing restoration.  

The study, which ini-
tially began at the National 
Institute on Deafness and Other 
Communication Disorders, 
is being carried out in Dr. 
Dabdoub’s laboratory in the UCSD 
School of Medicine, Division of 
Otolaryngology. 

“This induction has significant 
implications for clinical research 

related to cochlear implants,” 
he said. “The ability to 
replace damaged or lost neu-
rons with new cells through 
gene therapy would provide 
a substantial benefit to 
those suffering from hearing 
impairment.”

Scientists experiment 
with the ear tissue of mice 
embryos to regrow 
essential hearing neurons.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS
ing the proposal in November, insist-
ed that the main purpose of the media 
guidelines would be to “enhance” the 
quality of campus publications by 
way of faculty connections.

Many others — particularly, Koala 
editor in chief Kris Gregorian — see 
the proposal as a way to try and cut 
funding for the Koala.

In September, the 
Koala published a con-
troversial article about 
UCSD student Leon 
Roach, who died over 
the summer in a pole-
vaulting accident. 
Several councilmem-
bers attempted to pass a 
resolution that would cut 
funding for the Koala, 
but were discouraged by 
other members worried 
the interjection would 
infringe on free speech.

“[The proposal is] 
definitely directed at the 
Koala,” Gregorian said. 
“What is the purpose of this? What is 
its benefit? They’ve tried to get rid of 
us in the past, and this is just a sneakier 
way to do it.”

Eveleth, who helped draft the pro-
posal, agreed with Gregorian.

“The purpose of the legislation is 
to get rid of the Koala,” Eveleth said. 
“The A.S. Council will try to tell you 
otherwise, but I’m not buying it.”

Gregorian said that when he and his 
staff heard about the new guidelines, 
their first move was to obtain a faculty 
sponsor — Fred Driscoll of the UCSD 
physics department.

Ang denied the proposal was 
drafted in an attempt to cut the 
Koala’s funds.

“This is not about the Koala; this 
is not about any other magazine,” Ang 
said. “Maybe this came at a time when, 
you know, what the Koala did — 
maybe this came at that same time. But 
these media guidelines have not been 

touched in years … We want to make 
sure that we’re covering our grounds, 
and that everything is addressed.”

However, in an e-mail sent by 
Ang to councilmembers on Jan. 21, 
he wrote that the proposal was in 
response to unnamed “incidents” that 
occurred during Fall Quarter.

According to Gregorian, vari-
ous legal organiza-
tions — including 
the Foundation for 
Individual Rights 
in Education and 
the Student Press 
Law Center — have 
voiced disapproval 
of the proposal, and 
have confirmed it 
could pose a threat 
to free speech.

“Just because 
they pass a law that 
isn’t obviously cen-
sorship [because it] 
applies to everybody, 
if it’s targeted at a 
specific organiza-

tion, then it’s definitely considered cen-
sorship,” Gregorian said.

Drafted by Ang, Campuswide 
Senator Adam Kenworthy, 
Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund, 
Revelle Senator Jaclyn Storey and 
Marshall Senator Brian McEuen, the 
guidelines would require every campus 
media organization to obtain “spon-
sorship” from a college, academic 
department or nonacademic depart-
ment like the Alumni Association.

After the arrangement was signed 
off by a department chair or college 
dean, a faculty member would serve in 
an “advisory” capacity to the student 
organization. In return, the depart-
ment would be allowed a one-page, 
A.S.-funded advertisement.

Student publications unable to 
secure a departmental sponsor would 
no longer be eligible to receive funds 
from the A.S. Council.

According to Ang, a faculty advisor 

would be an asset to any publication, 
and could help students obtain quotes 
and information from university staff 
more easily — thus improving relations 
between student publications and the 
administration.

Though Kenworthy — who helped 
draft the proposal — said he has reser-
vations about the legislation in its cur-
rent form, he agreed that departmental 
resources could benefit smaller publi-
cations in need of guidance. 

“The whole idea is to sort of 
enrich the quality of reporting,” 
Kenworthy said. “We have a lot of 
magazines that would do well to pair 
with departments.”

However, Kenworthy expressed 
hesitations 

According to Eveleth, several 
organizations — as well as potential 
faculty representatives — are con-
cerned that the stipulation would 
infringe upon free speech at UCSD. 

“All the [faculty] I’ve talked to have 
expressed that they’re worried about 
this legislation. Not only from a free-
dom-of-speech position — in terms 
of how a department head is going to 
want some kind of oversight over what 
they’re signing off on and sponsoring 
— but also from a logistics standpoint,” 
Eveleth said. “There is not a single 
[organization] that is supporting it.”

In an anonymous Fall Quarter 
survey sent out by Eveleth to 21 
publications on campus, students 
expressed concern over the A.S. 
Council’s proposed intervention.

“With regard to staff oversight, 
I believe that student publications 
are not intended to represent anyone 
but the people publishing it,” one 
anonymous response read. “We exist 
so that we can express ourselves fully. 
If we can’t, then we may as well stop 
publishing. Moreover, I believe that 
this right extends to all publications, 
regardless of content.”

Ang said such concerns are

It’s been a strange week. Trees fell. Drivers panicked. DSW sold out of rubber boots 
in almost every size. A girl in my 
history class even claimed victory in 
nature’s greatest wet T-shirt contest. 

The source of so much commo-
tion? The kind of storm Facebook 
statuses reported as triggering a tor-
nado alert. Here. In La Jolla. Where 
a bad forecast usually means you 
just need to wear closed-toed shoes 
— not boots fashioned out of school 
bus-yellow rubber and a huge pon-
cho (the Southern California equiva-
lent of a Hazmat suit). 

Indeed, the fact that all of us — 
untested San Diego natives and those 
used to heavy downpour, too — were 
so ill-equipped to deal with an inch 
of rain isn’t much of a surprise. It’s 
not often we have to make a slip-
pery sprint to Center Hall wearing 
common-room trash bags. Even in 
the frigid, sub-70-degree weeks of 
January, our heavy coats don’t usually 
get much action. 

But what’s most alarming isn’t 
the fact that we don’t know how to 
respond when the forecast prohibits 
T-shirts and sandals; it’s just how 
sulky we become at the sight of that 
first dewy raindrop. 

You might think that, in a desert 
where we seldom get any closer to 
rainfall than a “Sound of Music” 
rerun, we’d be excited enough by 
the prospect of an authentic winter 
to run barefoot from our dorms out 
onto the pavement — heads tilted 
backward, tongues out, to taste God 
and global warming’s gift to the 
world — but if the past week’s wide-
spread helplessness is any indicator, 
that’s clearly not the case. 

And maybe for good reason. 
Last week, in the five exasperating 
minutes it took to beat the elements 
from the Sunshine Market to the top 
of the Literature Building, I went 
from feeling great about scoring a 
50-cent breakfast bar (to whoever 
thought to stuff all the saturated fat 
of a Cinnabon roll in a five-inch 
wrapper for mass consumption: 
you’re what I call a hero) to dab-
bing the inside of my shoe with a 
dwindling supply of paper towels 
and cursing the Lit Building for not 
being evacuated. 

In any event, I was in no posi-
tion to master the past-perfect tense 
with a soaked-through textbook and 
socks. I wanted to be dry, in bed, lis-
tening to the same mopey Liz Phair 
song on repeat until my ears bled or I 
began producing estrogen — which-
ever came first.

And that I did. (Well, almost — I 
can’t be certain of the correlation, 
though after a dozen or two plays of 
“Fuck and Run,” I suspect my facial-
hair growth may have slowed.) 

A couple days of grilled-cheese 
overindulgence later — not even 
the promise of a superior sandwich 
could rouse me from the safety of 
my room — I decided it was time to 
do something about my depressed 
condition. Chances are the storm 
would have outlasted my supply of 
sourdough and pepper jack anyway,

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  —  Last week, the UC Board of 
Regents announced that freshman applicants will be placed on waitlists 
for the first time beginning Fall 2010. Their reasoning: Over-enrollment 
at the nine undergraduate campuses must be curbed.

Although waiting an extra month or two for a final decision will be 
stressful for all those on the waitlist, the new admission method will 
allow for a few more students to squeeze into otherwise-wasted spots — 

a more solid variable for a system dangerously stretched past its maxi-
mum capacity. 

UCSD saw a 2.3-percent increase in applications from Fall 2009 to 
Fall 2010. Even more devastating was a 4.3-percent rise in applicants 
systemwide. It’s obvious we’ve got some serious overpopulation problems

At first glance, Obama’s Race to the Top ini-tiative is handing schools a seamless short-
cut to more cash, but in reality, many states — 
empty-pocketed California, in particular — has 
no chance of winning these awards. 

With the current economic crisis at hand, 
California is in no fiscal state to spend extra 
time raising low-income students’ test scores 
and amping up specialized teacher-student 
interaction — all the expensive preparations 
necessary to receive Obama’s stamp of approval 
and pocket one of the Race to the Top grants. 

Only 10 to 20 states will receive the 
grants in the first round of awards, and we 
can already surmise that California will, by 
default, be stampeded by more financially 
stable competitors who can actually undergo 
preliminary reforms.

With $18 billion in cuts accumulating from 
the last two years alone, our state is irrevocably 
damaged — or at least sunk to a level that’s out 
of the initiative’s reach. Not only is there no 
dollar-stuffed cushions to secure our jump into 
“better” education, but there is also very little 
motivation from disgruntled California teachers 
— who have to endure furlough days and pay 
cuts — to clean up the government’s mess. 

With additional pressure from schools, these 
peeved educational employees are forced to 
bolster their students’ performances in 
class so their institutions can be saved. 
For many, this seems a hopeless task 
that will simply eat up time, energy 
and money. 

So next time, Obama, try to make the 
game easier for those with a disadvantage 
on the playing field. California is the 
tortoise here — and slow and steady will 
not win the race.

President Obama’s newly proposed Race to the Top competition among schools on the 
national scale would offer an initial $4 billion 
stipend for education, in an attempt to close the 
achievement gap. 

Thousands of school districts in California, 
Ohio and Michigan have refused to join the race. 
One of the only reasons that school districts have 
declined to participate is that they are concerned 
with the possible ramifications of its requirements. 
While Race to the Top asks for full state involve-
ment, individual districts are allowed to opt out 
without sabotaging their entire state’s eligibility. 

But while there is no guarantee that Obama’s 
race will prove successful, there’s absolutely no 
harm in trying.

Should particular districts find they can’t keep 
up with the race’s requirements, they are not obli-
gated to continue. So then the question becomes, 
why not? At best, Race to the Top provides the 
opportunity for California to receive $700 million 

in federal aid. At worst, California would be 
right back where it is right now.

More than ever before, 
California needs as much 

funding as it can get for 
education. We’re cur-

rently ranked 48th 
for education in the 

entire country. 
The race’s $700 
million won’t 
do anything but 
help a little. It’s 
time to lace up 
our shoes and hit 
the track.

On Jan. 19, president Barack Obama requested $1.3 billion in additional funding for his 
$4.3-billion Race to the Top program — an 
incentive-based program aimed at improving K-12 
schools by creating a nationwide competition for 
the best standardized testing scores. Though the 
reward would provide some schools more fund-
ing — and how can you argue against that — such 
high monetary stakes might lead them to make 
hasty, superficial classroom decisions.

Obama’s objectives are certainly admirable. 
In order to qualify for the program, states must 
increase the frequency of their teacher evaluations, 
build data systems to measure student improvement 
and increase the amount of charter schools. 

So the game is on, and Obama’s new request for 
funding may add more cash to the competition’s 
jackpot. State education administrators are 
enrolling in contest-preparation sessions. State 
legislatures are scrambling to rewrite education 
laws. As practically every state struggles to bolster 
its budget, all involved have their eyes on the prize. 

This will not allow schools to put enough 
thought into complex and potentially life-
changing curriculum changes. Rick Hess, an 
education policy analyst with the American 
Enterprise Institute, expressed worry that Obama 
is rushing states to alter their system rules. “We’re 
institutionalizing impatience,” he told USA Today 
on Nov. 4. “There’s not much room for thoughtful 
conversation.”

While some states may benefit from the Race 
to the Top program, the nature of the competition 
guarantees that many will enter and few will win. 
In the process, the changes that states make to 
their schools may be careless and have unintended 
consequences. The U.S. government needs to think 
twice before it turns American education into a 
hyper-competitive game show.

OPINION� MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Is Internet porn the “crack cocaine of sexual addiction”? The porn industry nets 100 
billion a year and is considered the norm in mainstream media. Is this harmless 
entertainment changing the way we view others and ourselves? In light of our 
cultures interest in sex and its affects [i.e. TV shows: Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew, Oprah 
doing an upcoming television event on sex addiction, Girls Gone Wild’s popularity, 
the local Koala Club, etc….], our club Real Life, would like to host a nationally known 
speaker on the affects of sexual addiction in his life. His name is Michael Leahy and his 
presentation is called Porn Nation.

Michael Leahy, author of Porn Nation - the Naked Truth and prominent guest on 
Playboy Radio, ABC’s 20/20, the View, CNN, Fox News, and USA Today, is here to talk 
with us about the issue. Leahy will share facts about the porn industry, its effects on 
society, relationships and his personal journey with pornography. His story is a 
redemptive tale of struggle, ruin, loss and faith. He holds nothing back in sharing his 
spiritual journey of faith that sheds new light on his views on porn as well as the pains 
and joys of his porn addiction.

He is the founder of a grassroots social justice organization that is addressing the 
issues of pornography, prostitution, and sex trafficking around the world.

Come join us for this important discussion!

Dear Editor,
What if we lived in a world where 

your cell-phone carrier raised your 
bill and, at the same time, reduced 
your coverage? What if your landlord 
increased your rent by a third and 
then took away your bathroom? What 
if you took a flight and the airline 
raised the price while in midair?

These seem like ridiculous scenar-
ios, but something similar is happen-
ing all across UC campuses right now.

The cost of your education is sky-
rocketing just as students are forced 
to endure overcrowded classrooms — 
due to the all-too-common predica-
ment of full enrollment rosters and 
reduced course offerings.

If only papers and finals were the 
worst of your worries.

In the span of this next year, the 
UC Regents will raise your fees by 
over 30 percent, after more than dou-
bling them in the last 10 years. When 
you speak out about these injustices, 
the best that administrators can do 
is blame Sacramento for disinvesting 
in the University of California — and 
then look to private funding sources.

And while it is true that public 
sources of funding for education 
have diminished due to state budget 
woes, the story is not that simple. 
The majority of California legisla-
tors know that California should be 
investing in its students and future 
workforce, not abandoning them and 
putting up even more barriers to a 
quality education.

That is why I have proposed that 
we adequately fund our community 
colleges, state colleges and univer-
sities by requiring oil companies 
to pay their fair share for the oil 
and natural gas they pump out of 
California’s land and water. We can 

no longer afford to be the only major 
oil-producing state that doesn’t levy 
such a fee. Texas, for instance, gener-
ates $400 million for higher educa-
tion through a similar fee.

My bill, AB 656, would raise up to 
$2 billion for the UC, CSU and com-
munity colleges with a 12.5-percent 
tax on oil extracted within California. 
That’s considerably less than the 
25-percent tax levied in Sarah Palin’s 
Alaska. The oil companies will tell 
you that they already pay enough 
taxes, and that this bill will result 
in jobs lost. Yet oil companies have 
been experiencing record-breaking 
profits for the past several years. 
Exxon Mobil, for instance, raked in a 
$45.2-billion profit in 2008, the most 
ever made by a publicly traded U.S. 
company.

The UC system is crucial to our 
state’s economy. It generates billions 
of dollars in economic activity and 
attracts billions more in research dol-
lars, money that fuels key industries 
like agriculture, energy and biotech-
nology.

With big oil ready to spend lav-
ishly to defeat AB 656, this won’t be 
an easy fight — but it’s a fight I’m 
confident we can win together. Please

cerned Californians in fighting for 
higher education at www.facebook.

A seasoned hypo-
chondriac, there was 
only one place for me 
to turn: the Internet. 

I shortly found 
that there’s a common 
medical designation 
for what may or may 
not have reduced me 
to an under-the-cover 
Cheez-It binge — one 
with an acronym that 
couldn’t have been 
more spot-on: Seasonal Affective 
Disorder. 

According to the trusted experts 

at WebMD.com and Wikipedia, I 
more than fit the bill. Between the 
ages of 15 and 55? Check. Feeling 

sad, grumpy, moody or 
anxious when there’s no 
sunshine? Quadruple 
check. By the time I 
scrolled down to the bit 
about craving carbohy-
drates, I needed no fur-
ther convincing: I was 
sick — ill, really — and 
for all the Parmesan and 
garlic Cheez-Its I could 
stomach, no treatment 
but a sunny afternoon 

could heal me. 
Thankfully, this is Southern 

California — where, I am convinced, 

no week can pass without a fresh 
sunburn (for a ginger, anyway) — 
and by Saturday, I was healed. The 
clouds parted, the debris cleared 
and I finally got my hands on a meal 
consisting of more than three-week-
old bread and melted cheese. 

But for those couple days that 
my fellow hypochondria/SAD-
afflicted peers and I were forced 
to take refuge at home, the end of 
the world one violent gust away, 
it occurred to me that maybe the 
reason they call it El Niño is that 
only a sugar-addicted toddler can 
match the terror of a violent storm. 
Wikipedia begs to differ, but I don’t 
care. No one really believes those 
pages, anyway.

well-qualified students who applied 
but were not originally offered a 
space.” 

This would help the university 
accurately enroll the number of stu-
dents it is funded to support. The 
exact number of students to be placed 
on waitlists has not been determined, 
though UC Vice President for Budget  
and Capital Resources Patrick Lens 
estimated 1,000. 

UC Irvine experimented with 
a pilot waitlist program this fall. 
Approximately 700 applicants were 
offered a spot on the waitlist in March 
2009, and one-half decided to accept.

“Following receipt of the 
Statement of Intent to Register forms 
on May 1, Irvine found that it had 
some space to admit additional stu-

dents,” Wilbur said. “The campus 
decided to offer a space to all students 
on its waitlist.”

Joshua Kim, a junior at Oxford 
Academy High School, said that 
although the new waitlists will not 
influence his UC application deci-
sions, the plan is a good idea.

“The waitlists can’t hurt anyone,” 
Kim said. “I’d rather be told I’m 
on their waitlists than get rejected. 
Regardless, I’m still going to apply to 
the four or five UC [campuses] I want 
to go to.”

The committee has yet to deter-
mine which UC campuses will imple-
ment waitlists. 

“It is voluntary, however, and 
individual UC campus participation 
is optional,” Wilbur said. “But the 
conversations are serious, and the 

probability of 
implementing a 
waitlist strategy 
is very high.”

The com-
mittee is in the 
process of work-
ing out potential 
complications, 
such as deciding 
whether or not 
a student can be 
on multiple lists. 
Specific details 
regarding coor-
dination of the 
process are still 
in the works.

poor decision on A.S. Council’s part.” 
The Grove’s debt is borrowed from 

the university, and does not currently 
affect the A.S. Enterprise budget.

“Technically, if the Grove kept 
a steady level of debt indefinitely, it 
would be more advantageous to keep 
it open,” Benesch said. “If the Grove 
was closed, the debt would have to be 
paid off. It makes sense to break even. 
We would accept it, but ideally we want 
profitability.” 

A.S. President Utsav Gupta made 
“saving” the Grove a main point of his 
platform during the election season 
last year. When Gupta began his term, 
he removed the professional manager, 
aiming to revert to a more student-
oriented business model.

“The previous administration 
didn’t put focus on the Grove,” Gupta 
said. “Instead of taking responsibility 
for the debt, they were blaming the 
responsibility on the Grove, and tried 
to remove it.”

The latest changes to the cafe 
include a simplified menu — offering 
simple, easy foods like sandwiches and 
breakfast items — with the intention of 
becoming the most affordable eatery 
on campus. Everything on the menu 
sells for under $5, and coffee is $1, one 
of the cheapest prices on campus.

“I’m trying to cut costs to make the 
food more accessible, so undergradu-
ate students will come to the Grove,” 
Grove Student Manager Thomas Frank 
said. “While it is great to have graduate 
students, researchers and professors 
coming to the Grove, it’s stupid to not 
target the students that are on this 
campus each day.” 

Last quarter, the Grove was par-
tially closed for renovations such as 
repainting, installing black tile floors, 
creating new menus and purchas-
ing a $3,700 convection toaster oven. 
University Centers also paid to redo 
the deck and add more lighting. 

“With internal and external 
reforms, we can make the Grove prof-

itable right now,” Ghosh said. “I think 
realistically, within the next two years, 
the Grove can have its debt paid off.”

If the Grove goes further into debt, 
University Centers has the authority to 
terminate the Grove’s lease, forcing its 
$140,000 debt to be paid off.

Eleanor Roosevelt College fresh-
man Audris Fan, who attended the 
grand reopening, said she waited 40 
minutes for a free personal pizza. 

“The bites I had were pretty good, 
but I felt like it’s not worth it to return 
to the Grove,” Fan said.

Sixth College senior Leena Barakat 
said she frequented the Grove before 
the changes, but approves of the reno-
vations. 

“Their food is actually one of 
the best foods I’ve had on campus,” 
Barakat said. “It’s in a nice location, 
and the prices are really good. I will 
come back for sure.”

unfounded.
“There have been arguments about 

free speech, but I really don’t see how 
this relates to free speech,” Ang said. 
“We’re not telling them what they can 
write [or] what they can’t write. And 
the advisors, the university employees, 
will be there to just advise them — to 
help them better their writing.”

Kenworthy said he participated 
in the drafting of the proposal due to 
his concern over the A.S. Council’s 
responsibility to spend student fees 
on quality publications that reflect 
the desires of the student body. 

“You have two sides to the argu-
ment,” Kenworthy said. “You have one 
side that says, you have to allow free 
speech in all its forms … [But] on the 
other hand … if we put student money 
toward something that students don’t 
want on this campus, then that’s not 
very responsible of us. Whether or 
not, legally, we’re responsible for what’s 
published, we still fund it, and I think 
that’s a burden on us. There was just 

a call to have a higher standard of the 
quality of what’s published.” 

According to Eveleth, who met with 
the editors of several different newspa-
pers and magazines, students are wor-
ried that the proposal could be an addi-
tional roadblock for new publications. 

“They’re all very concerned that 
it’s going to make it much more diffi-
cult for them to function as a publica-
tion, and some of them… are worried 
about surviving the year, if it does get 
passed,” Eveleth said. 

Nicole Teixeira, editor in chief of 
the Muir Quarterly, agreed.

“As much as I would support get-
ting the Koala off A.S. funding, to 
do it with this proposal comes at too 
great a cost,” Teixeira said. “It’s going to 
limit [media organizations’] creativity, 
because they’re going to have someone 
to report back to, and it’s going to make 
it much harder for new organizations.”

Gregorian expressed a similar con-
cern for startup media orgs on campus.

“It’s not going to hurt an estab-
lished newspaper like the Koala,” 

Gregorian said. “We’ve just been here 
for too long for something like that 
to hurt us — but what it does hurt is 
new media, and that’s far worse than 
hurting the Koala, in my mind.”

The A.S. Council will be holding 
an open forum Tuesday to discuss the 
guidelines and receive feedback from 
the community before being voted 
upon at Wednesday’s meeting. 

Kenworthy said he feels the legis-
lation could use some more thought.

“I think that we haven’t done 
enough to consult media orgs. We 
haven’t done enough to consult with 
departments — make sure everyone’s 
alright with it, and most of all, make 
sure they understand what the pro-
cess is going to look like,” Kenworthy 
said. “I mean, we’re having a forum 
the day before we’re actually passing 
it to see what they think of it. I just 
don’t think that, in hindsight, we 
handled the situation very well.”

STUDENTS WAITLISTED 
AT UCI LAST YEAR

OVERENROLLED 
STUDENTS IN THE UC 
SYSTEM



OPINION� MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

on our hands — especially while the 
university tries to cram 15,000 more 
students into lecture halls than it can 
adequately support with plummeting 
state funds.

The regents figure that a waitlist 
of roughly 1,000 students across the 
entire UC system will allow cam-
puses the flexibility of staying within 
enrollment targets while still uphold-
ing their famous top-students admis-
sion guarantee.

Last year during application sea-
son, the UC system reduced enroll-
ment by 2,300 students 
— admitting about 74,000 
students, 34,000 of whom 
enrolled, over 2,000 stu-
dents fewer than in 2008. 
Before the 2006 economic 
crash, the UC system was 
able to accommodate any 
miscalculations; however, 
cut after cut to the budget 
has left the university with 
little room for error.

Under the new waitlist 
system, however, the UC admis-
sions departments can wait until the 
university’s 2010-11 budget becomes 
more clear this spring, and enroll 
waitlistees based on how much 
money the state hands over.

It’s a practical move. Private col-
leges such as Princeton University 
and Boston College are making their 
waitlists longer to cushion unpre-
dictable acceptance rates. In today’s 
economic environment, more and 
more students are turning away from 
private schools and toward public 
universities. Waitlists will allow each 
UC branch to maximize the admis-
sion of students who actually want to 
attend that campus, while avoiding 
risky spikes in overenrollment.

And the news could be worse 
for applicants. Last week, the UC 
Office of the President announced 

that the UC system was planning 
to cut enrollment by an additional 
2,300 students for the 2010-11 aca-
demic year. But they partially took 
back the evil last week, announcing 
that the university isn’t planning to 
cut enrollment quite so drastically 
— instead opening up the waitlist 
option. 

There are, of course, some draw-
backs to the waitlist. One campus 
might miss out on a $150 Statement 
of Intent to Register deposit fee if 
a student decides to hold out for a 
campus where he’s waitlisted. Then 

there’s the mental 
well-being of high-
school seniors to 
consider. Students 
holding out to hear 
from a particular UC 
campus may hold 
off on community-
college enrollment, 
only to be dealt a 
second disappoint-
ing letter from their 
university of choice. 
Then, considering the 

intense cuts to state and community 
colleges, their plan B school might 
not have room for them either. 

Not knowing whether one is 
accepted or rejected can also make 
the financial planning essential to 
a college career even more excru-
ciating. The regents have yet to 
figure out how students admitted 
from waitlists will receive finan-
cial aid; and if the university plans 
to model its system after schools 
like Occidental College, students 
accepted from the waitlist would 
not receive financial aid. As the UC 
budget is gouged deeper and deeper, 
by the time waitlisted students are 
accepted, the aid well will likely have 
dried up. Cutting financial aid for 
waitlisted students could endanger 
the heavily touted Blue and Gold 

Plan, and have a devastating effect 
on those poorer families it currently 
protects.

In order to ensure equal financial 
aid for waitlisted students, campus 
aid offices will have to do a lot of 
research and pre-planning to cal-
culate how many students will be 
taken off the waitlist, and therefore 
how many will need aid. Projections 
may seem simple enough, but 
recent years have seen some pain-
fully off-point yield rates. In 2008, 
for instance, the university enrolled 
1,800 more students than in 2007 — 
necessitating a drastic enrollment cut 
of 2,300 the following year.

The UC waitlist plan might put 
the system’s finances at an even 
greater disadvantage, but it’s worth 
the risk if the university can enroll 
as many students as possible. It’s the 
system’s mission to offer admission 
to all those who qualify, and in order 
to maintain its integrity during this 
recession, it might have to cut a few 
corners along the way. 

In the end, the waitlist idea 
might be canned altogether if Gov. 
Schwarzenegger’s proposed bud-
get — which allots $53.4 million to 
the UC system — doesn’t pass. If 
we don’t receive at least that much 
money, those would-be 2,300 wait-
listers will simply get the boot. Sad 
as that would be, the university’s No. 
1 priority is not stuffing its lecture 
halls past maximum capacity. But 
granted we receive the better budget 
line, giving students a temporary 
“maybe” will provide the university’s 
shaky enrollment situation the leg-
room it needs; and why deny a few 
hundred more students a raffle ticket 
to their dream school?

UUnfortunately, there is no chocolate-making major at UCSD. That’s probably why Richard and Michael Antonorsi — two brothers who graduated from UCSD in the mid-1980s — settled on degrees in computer science and bioengineering, respec-tively.However, once they left the La Jolla bubble, the duo resisted the corporate pull of 
their studies and left for their home country of Venezuela to pursue personal busi-
ness ventures. One dot-com bust and a couple years of individual soul-searching 
later, the two reunited in Encinitas to found Chuao Chocolatier: a gourmet confec-
tionary company with a knack for unpredictable flavor combos. 

At first, the siblings ran a modest candy boutique, testing out recipes and flavors 
to gauge their product’s popularity. Richard used the smarts he picked up in his dot-
com days to manage the company’s business logistics, while Michael drew from his 
Parisian cooking education to come up with a couple eclectic concoctions.

Michael’s first successful flavor was Spicy Maya — a bow to an ancient Mayan 
hot-chocolate recipe that used pasilla chile and cayenne pepper. It opened the flood-
gates to a slew of other odd combos: chocolate pods filled with passion fruit-infused 
caramel; bonbons flavored with goat cheese and fruity brandy; and the Firecracker — 
a salty dark-chocolate bar filled with pop rocks and chipotle.

“All your senses are engaged,” Michael said in an interview with This Week at

AAs if the buzz surrounding this season’s biggest 3-D block-buster isn’t enough, UCSD students can add alma-mater pride to the list of reasons to watch “Avatar.” In the James Cameron feature film, UCSD alumnus and actor Dileep Rao — a 1995 Muir College graduate — plays the role of good scientist 
Dr. Max Patel, acting alongside Sigourney Weaver and Sam 
Worthington.

While at UCSD, Rao’s passion for acting led him to a 
class at the La Jolla Playhouse’s Summer Conservatory. Later, 
after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political sci-
ence, he earned his Master of Fine Arts from the American 
Conservatory Theater. 

Since then, Rao has landed roles in both television and 
film, including the show “Brothers and Sisters” and “Drag Me 
to Hell” — a 2009 horror film in which he played a mysterious 
fortuneteller.

But after his rise to fame on the back of “Avatar,” Rao said 
he feels he’s truly made it. 

“My career is going very well,” Rao said. “I live the life I 
dreamed — but scarcely hoped for — as young man in the 

dorms of Tioga and Tenaya.”
Rao said UCSD was one of the most intellectually and 

diverse environments he has ever encountered.
“I met more inquisitive minds in my four years there than I 

have in most of the rest of my life,” Rao said. “It’s the strangest 
hybrid of the finest scientists and mathematicians walking a 
grand campus with brilliant directors of theater, some great art 
and strong instruction in a vast range of departments.”

He also credited professors in the theater department for 
teaching him a “standard of excellence” — something that has 
stayed with him throughout his professional career. 

Rao said he felt fortunate to work with Cameron — both 
for his legendary reputation and his visionary work.

With “Avatar” behind him, Rao’s next movie will be in sci-fi 
thriller “Inception,” due to be released in July 2010 alongside 
director Christopher Nolan and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

“To be an artist and make my living from that effort is the 
most satisfying and humbling of journeys,” Rao said. “My only 
advice is this: Pick what you love as soon as you know it, work 
harder than you can ever have and never, ever give up.”

IIt’s no wonder video games still cap the top of your birthday wish list: The industry has gone from GoldenEye to Gears of War in two decades flat.Just as video games began to make their way from TV sets to computer screens, Michel Kripalani was gearing up 
to graduate from UCSD with a Bachelor of Visual Arts. He 
was also finishing up a “life-changing” internship with a 
local design firm in Del Mar — one he said made his pas-
sion for digital media glaringly clear.

“By the time I graduated, I knew what I wanted to do 
professionally,” Kripalani said. “I found myself at the cutting 
edge of a new industry. I loved the idea of mixing art and 
technology.”

After college, Kripalani leapt straight into a startup com-
pany that set a swift pace for the young entrepreneur. After 
two years of designing interactive multimedia software, 
Kripalani switched things up and began to pour his talents 
into developing computer games. In 1991, when he was 
23, he started his second company, Presto Studios, with his 
roommate, hoping to develop the most advanced graphics a 
CD-ROM was capable of displaying. 

In the 11 years that Kripalani managed Presto, the 
team created photorealistic games such as the Journeyman 

Project series (a postapocalyptic, first-person adventure), 
Myst 3: Exile (a quest set in Tolkien dreamscapes) and 
Whacked! (in which goofy cartoons beat the crap out of 
each other with oversized staplers and grenades).

According to Kripalani, he was never afraid to take risks 
— an “entrepreneur at heart.” When he was laid off last 
January by Autodesk — an international software/architec-
tural design corporation — Kripalani was eager to surf the 
next wave of digital design. 

“The whole time I was at Autodesk I was planning my 
next big thing,” Kripalani said. “When Apple shipped the 
first iPhone in June of 2007, I had to have one. When they 
made the [software development kit] available to developers 
and opened the App Store in June of 2008, the writing was 
on the wall.”

That’s when Kripalani decided to embark on his lat-
est business endeavor: iPhone apps. In 2009, he formed 
Oceanhouse Media along with Presto Studios partner Greg 
Uhler and his wife Karen. The company that designs and 
publishes its own line of over 75 positive-spirited iPhone 
apps — his first (and favorite) being Bowls, a relatively

3IIn our current economic climate, the thought of making a career — and money — off something we love seems a mere classroom fantasy. But stories of serious daydreamers like 1978 Revelle 

College graduate Rusty Preisendorfer, 
founder and namesake of surf brand 
Rusty, still provide a scrap of hope.

Born and raised in San Diego, 
Preisendorfer started surfing in eighth 
grade, back when Black’s Beach — his 
favorite hometown break — was still an 
undiscovered gem.

In the fall of 1971, Preisendorfer 
entered his freshman year at UCSD, and 
immediately joined the surf team. That 
same year, he created his first board 
brand: Starlight Surfboards.

Preisendorfer took a break from aca-
demia in 1972 and spent the next three 
years surfing for Gordon and Smith, 
where he also worked behind the scenes 
constructing surfboards.  

Triumphant after his travels to some 

of the world’s most famous surf digs, 
Preisendorfer returned to UCSD in 1975 
and chose a major in visual arts. He start-
ed his second label — Music! Surfboards 
— the same year.

After graduating in 1978, Preisendorfer 
began shaping for Canyon Glassing. He 
spent the following seven years perfecting 
his technique and developing his reputa-
tion as a top surfboard shaper.

Finally, in 1985, Rusty Surfboards was 
conceived.

The brand exploded, soon expanding 
to include skate, snow and wakeboarding 
gear and sell its merchandise throughout 
the Americas, Europe and Pacific Asia. In 
2008, Preisendorfer was dubbed Surfing 
Magazine’s Shaper of the Year.

A San Diegan at heart, Preisendorfer 
still lives in La Jolla, an active fan and 
donor to Triton athletics, the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography and the 
UCSD Moores Cancer Center’s annual 
Luau and Longboard Invitational.

DDespite all the holier-than-thou atti-tudes on Yelp, 
’86 Revelle 
alumni and 
plastic surgeon 
Dr. Tom Pousti 
has achieved 
the Holy Grail 
of consumer 
review site: a 
solid five-star 
rating.

Pousti isn’t 
only popular, 

he’s experienced too, with 12 years 
in private practice and over 10,000 
surgeries—ranging from the usual 
tummy tucks and face lifts to the 
not-so-usual labial reductions, gyne-
comastias and otoplasties (look ‘em 
up) — under his belt. Oh, and he’s 
expensive: A boob job will run you 
anywhere from $4,800 to $7,300 
depending on what material you 
want floating around in your chest.

According to the doc, who grad-
uated with a degree in animal physi-
ology, UCSD was his first choice, as 
was his profession. 

Pousti said he had always wanted 
to be a physician, but ultimately 
chose to specialize in plastic surgery 
because of the range of procedures 
he’d have at his fingertips.

“The nice thing about plastic 
surgery is you get to do head to toe 
[work] — facial trauma, congenital 
trauma, burns, all kinds of recon-
structive work, hand surgery,” Pousti 
said. “There’s a lot of variety and I 
think variety is what makes it inter-
esting.”

With 15 years of postsecond-
ary education to his name (and 
diplomas from UCSD, UCI, and 
Harvard), Pousti’s spent more than 
half of his life in school. 

“You get to be an old guy by the 

TThe Jacobs family name is plastered on buildings and benefits all over San Diego, closely linked to technology and high-class education. It’s no surprise that Gary Jacobs — UCSD alumnus and son of Irwin and 
Joan Jacobs, after whom UCSD’s engineer-
ing school was named — has carried on 
the Jacob legacy in his own life’s work.

Founder and chair of High Tech High 
— a network of eight K-12 charter schools 
based in San Diego — 1979 graduate Gary 
Jacobs received his Bachelor of Arts in 
management science.

After graduation, Jacobs worked as a 
programmer and software engineer at his 

dad’s companies: Linkabit and Qualcomm. 
By the time he left behind the not-so-
quaint family businesses in 2000, he had 
earned the title of senior education spe-
cialist at Qualcomm and was striving to 
improve the math and science programs in 
local public schools. At the time, the busi-
ness community was beginning to realize 
that traditional public high schools were 
not preparing students with the tools they 
needed to succeed in the 21st century.

As somewhat of a fluke, Jacobs attended

UCSD. “That’s entertainment.”
To ground his vast collection 

of complimentary flavors, Michael 
always uses Venezuelan cacao seeds 
to make Chuao chocolate. In fact, 
the Antonorsi brothers’ family grew 
the plant themselves on a farm called 
Augustana in Rio Caribe back in the 
day. In honor of their roots, the broth-
ers partnered with nonprofit organiza-
tions to teach cacao-growing tech-
niques in isolated areas of Venezuela.

On top of succeeding in their 
altruistic endeavors, the Antonorsi 
brothers collected about $2.5 million 

in sales in 2008, earning mention 
on several Food Network cooking 
shows and publications like Time and 
Newsweek. They’ve also partnered 
with a number of high-end cafes 
and grocery stores, including Whole 
Foods and Ralphs.

In another homage to their 
beginnings, the Antonorsi brothers’ 
chocolates are sold at Perks and the 
Sunshine Store. You can also stop 
by the Chuao boutique in Westfield 
UTC to try a spicy Mayan hot choc-
olate — if for no other reason than, 
as Michael put it, “chocolate makes

According to Kripalani, his 
company hopes to produce up to 
100 more apps this year, including 
a series of self-help programs based 
on the works of popular Hay House 
authors, and interactive eBooks 
based on Dr. Seuss classics. 

Kirpalani said he recommends 

getting as much work experience as 
possible in the college years.

 “Internships are absolutely fan-
tastic — they help to prepare you 
for the workforce,” Kripalani said. 
“More importantly, they help you to 
determine if you truly are passion-
ate about a particular field. So find 
an internship — jump in and get 
wet. And yes, Oceanhouse Media 
is always on the lookout for good 
interns. We’ve already hosted four 
students in the last year alone.”

when a colleague couldn’t make it. 
“I got hooked at that meeting, 

and the rest is history,” he said.
Jacobs went on to found and 

chair High Tech High, which takes 
a revolutionary approach to educa-
tion: All students participate in 
community service and intern-
ships, with the aid of no textbooks 
nor traditional subject divisions; 
for instance, a single class consoli-
dates art, biology and multimedia. 
Classes revolve around hands-on 
experiments — like, say, using 
DNA analysis to identify pieces of 
African bushmeat that are actu-
ally endangered species, illegally 
poached.

It’s an unorthodox but success-
ful formula: Every one of High 
Tech High’s graduates has been 
admitted to college. 

On top of the countless hours he 
spends fostering High Tech High, 
Jacobs works in investments, owns 
minor-league baseball team Lake 
Elsinore Storm and stays involved 
in numerous philanthropic organi-
zations in the San Diego area.

Gary and his wife Jerri-Anne 
even managed to one-up Mom 
and Pop Jacobs in 2006, when they 
donated $1 million to UCSD — the 
largest single gift ever made by an 
alumnus.

Despite his success, Jacobs said 
he still wishes he had established 
deeper connections with faculty 
and students at UCSD. 

“When one is out in the real 
world, it is extremely valuable to 
bounce ideas off of people you trust 
and have a shared experience with,” 
Jacobs said. 

time you get to work,” Pousti said. 
“But it’s definitely worth it.”

And from his comments on what 
he misses most about our UCSD 
bubble, it’s clear that Pousti’s had to 
endure more than his fair share of 
sleepless nights and cram session to 
achieve his current success.

“I enjoyed [UCSD’s] libraries — 
lots of places to kind of sit down and 
study,” Pousti said. “I was a pretty 
studious guy. I didn’t socialize as 

much as I would have liked to at that 
time.”

His advice for would-be Nip/
Tuck-ers:

“Get a good start from the begin-
ning because it’s easier to keep a 
decent GPA than to try to make up 
ground. It’s easy to get distracted 
when you get into college — there’s 
lots of pretty girls and pretty boys 
and all kinds of distractions. You 
gotta stay focused and keep your 
eyes on the prize.”

SATIN LOUNGE

SITESEEN P itched as “San Diego’s newest 18 and 21 hot spot,” Satin Lounge revolves around the idea that 18-year-olds can enjoy a great clubbing 
experience without a drop of drink. And if elder 
folks don’t mind running into their baby cousin 
and her “Mean Girl” posse while drowning their 
collegiate sorrows, they might have a pretty good 
time, too. 

Probably due to its close proximity to San 
Diego State, Satin is a far cry from the glamor-
ous nightclub it makes itself out to be. Patrons are 
required to make their way down a seedy, dimly 
lit alleyway to reach the entrance of the club, and 
— if they survive the trek — are then segregated 
by age into two separate lines. Those of age are 
welcomed in by a bright-orange wristband read-
ing “OVER 21” in big black letters, while all eager 
under-agers are shepherded inside one door over, 
stumbling from pregame overcompensation.

The venue itself is a cross between a garage 
party and rundown strip club, complete with a 
disco ball and stripper pole in the middle of the 
dance floor. As for furnishings, red and white 
circus tent drapes fail miserably at disguising the 
lounge’s concrete walls, and the sound from scat-
tered TV sets never seem to match up with the 
on-screen visuals.

Though Shirley-temple bars are plentiful in 
Satin Lounge, the only 
counter that serves alco-
hol is caged by a chain-
link fence. The ugly 
orange stripe, of course, 
is necessary to gain access 

to this player’s paradise. (Unsurprisingly, it seems 
a favorite hangout for older clubgoers of the male 
persuasion — perhaps having something to do 
with its perch over the wannabe strip-club area, 
conveniently swarming with young girls). The 
other drink stations cater to the underage crowd, 

where younger guys can practice their bar lean as 
they order a Red Bull or a root beer for the cutie in 
the corner.

Bottom line: Satin Lounge is the perfect desti-
nation to meet creepy older guys — and plenty of 
them. It’s also one of the only places you could get 
away with wearing sweatpants at a club (but don’t 
forget your Reeboks with the straps). Whatever the 
case, you’ll probably have a better time at the Taco 
Bell down the street.

STUDENT DISCOUNT!

BYRON WASHOM
UNCOMMONfolk

BY KERRY FUGETT�s�STAFF WRITER

T he green movement at UCSD has gath-ered substantial momentum over the last five years: Already, the university 
generates 80 percent of all the energy it 
consumes. Aside from having all the right 
scientific resources at our fingertips, a good 
amount of UCSD’s sustainability efforts can 
be credited to a dedicated few: students, fac-
ulty and volunteers donating their personal 
time and prowess to make good on the cam-
pus’ claim to be one of the greenest universi-
ties in the nation.

For the last two years, solar-energy entre-
preneur Byron Washom has been doing just 

that: applying his vast knowledge of energy 
grids, renewable energy, recycling natural 
gas and creating zero waste to our current 
situation. 

“It’s like jumping on a train already run-
ning down the tracks, and it’s already headed 
where I wanted to go,” Washom said. “I 
haven’t worked this hard in 20 years. I love 
it.”

After two decades as president of 
Advanco Corp. — the self-founded environ-
mental-technology consulting firm that set a 
world record in 1984 for converting 29.4 per-
cent of solar energy to the grid — Washom 
said he is hoping he can preserve the campus 
spirit that attracted him to UCSD in the first 
place, when his son began attending the uni-
versity. Washom soon came on as a volunteer 
for the school’s sustainability efforts. 

This past September, Washom became 
the campus’ first director of “strategic energy 
initiatives.” The position was specially created 
for Washom to oversee the implementation 
of sustainable technology on campus, act as 
a consultant for green student organizations 
and oversee a new plan that’ll ensure UCSD 
meets its energy needs in the most envi-
ronmentally safe and cost-effective manner 
possible. He has advised organizations like 
the World Bank, International Finance Corp., 
the International Energy Agency and the U.S. 
Department of Energy on employing clean-
energy technologies here and abroad.

According to Washom, green technology 
is rapidly gaining international attention, and 

— in the dour face of a stagnant economy — 
UCSD’s initiatives are pushing the envelope.

Not long after being hired, Washom 
spoke on behalf of the university when 
he voices his support for a proposal led 
by SDG&E (in conjunction with 28 other 
businesses and organizations including 
CleanTech San Diego and Qualcomm). The 
plan suggested creating a smart grid — a 
state-of-the-art electricity network con-
necting consumers and suppliers in San 
Diego — and would produce up to 3,200 
jobs in Southern California. The proposal 
was directed at the Obama administration, 

which set aside $4.5 billion for smart grids 
nationwide.

Just as Washom was entering his new 
position, the university was also installing 
one megawatt of photovoltaic solar panels 
atop the Gilman Parking Structure and initi-
ating construction of a 2.4-megawatt fuel-cell 
system powered by Point Loma Wastewater 
Treatment Facility — which will replace 
carbon-based fuel with a methane-based 
alternative.

Washom said a substantial push for the 
university’s green ambitions has come from 
activists within the student body. And, as a 
host of energy initiatives pick up steam, he 
said students are becoming more and more 
involved with the innumerable projects and 
operations on campus.

But good intentions can’t go anywhere 
without the funds to back them. This past 
November, a huge chunk of funding was 
gifted Jacob’s School of Engineering students, 
who wrote a grant proposal that secured 
$154 million of federal funds for the develop-
ment of clean, renewable energy. According 
to Washom, it comes down to momentum: 
Once you start getting grants, it’s a lot easier 
to get even more.  

“I defy anyone to show me another 
campus which has the same composition of 
support for sustainability as UC San Diego,” 
Washom said. “To know us is to love us.”

points, and sophomore center 
Christian Hatch sent in eight points.

No other Triton scored more 
than five points in the game. 

Despite jumping out to a 15-4 
lead — with Lawley and Acevedo 
connecting for three triples — the 
Tritons could not rein back the 
Lumberjacks after giving up the 
lead, and suffered a 60-74 defeat. 

UCSD returns home for four 
straight games over the next two 
weeks. The team will open the 
stretch against Cal Poly Pomona 
on Jan. 28 at 7:30 p.m., before 
welcoming Cal State San Bernardino 
into town on Jan. 31.

register a time of 2:03.88, claiming 
victory in an event she had not 
competed in for four years. Henley 
was also victorious in the 400-yard 
individual medley, where she won 
by 22 seconds with a time of 4:28.29.

In the speediest event of the day, 
junior Jessica Ferguson won a close 
50-yard freestyle heat with a time of 
24.64 seconds. Once the men were 
up, senior Dan Perdew was the first 
to flip, and powered through the 
final sprint to win with a time of 
21.14 seconds. Perdew’s next victory 
came in the 100-yard butterfly.

Junior Anju Shimura easily beat 
out the competition in both the 
100-yard and 200-yard backstroke 
events, with times of 58.56 seconds 
and 2:06.42 minutes, respectively.

To close the day, the women’s 
200-yard freestyle team — Shimura, 
Ferguson, sophomore Shea Kopp 
and freshman Amber Tan — won 
with a time of 1:37.73.

The men’s team — Perdew, 
freshman Julius Espiritu, senior 
Todd Langland and sophomore 
Blake Langland — won the same 
event with a close time of 1:23.73.

“For [the seniors], it’s a much 
bigger emotional event,” coach 
McGihon said. “But I know we’ll 
get to see them again. And many of 
them will be swimming at nationals 
— and it’s bigger to see them swim 
at conference than at a dual meet.”

After earning a handful of 
automatic bids to the national 
championships this past weekend, 
the Tritons hope to add more at the 

dual meet at UC Davis next Saturday. 
The team will then travel to the 
Pacific Collegiate Swimming and 
Diving Conference Championships, 
taking place Feb. 10 to Feb. 13 in 
Long Beach.

Coach McGihon feels that the 
upcoming showdown will be a 
defining meet for the Tritons, as 
they will be facing off against their 
conference rivals for the last time 
before nationals.

“We just want to drive home that 
it’s the little details that make all the 
difference,” McGihon said. “When 
you’re going after a championship 
performance, you can’t overlook the 
little things.”

cut the lead to three, and the Tritons 
went into the break with a lean 34-31 
lead. 

Seawolf Stephanie Barnes hit a 
three-pointer 34 seconds into the 
second half, which tied the game 
— but the Tritons responded with a 
12-0 run over the next five minutes, 
putting the game just out of their op-
ponents’ reach. Ilg knocked down a 
three-pointer with 14:11 remaining, 
putting the Tritons up by 12; UCSD 
led by double digits for the remainder 
of the game. 

The Tritons limited Sonoma to 
only 21 second-half points and 28-per-
cent shooting from the floor.

Our defense is what won the game 
for us,” Hunter said. “We came out in 

the second half with a mission to get 
a defensive stop every play. We pres-
sured the ball, rebounded and tried to 
get a steal or stop on every possession.” 

The win put the Tritons at 15-1 
overall and 10-1 in the CCAA.

Sonoma was led by senior guard 
Jennifer Russo — the only Seawolf to 
hit double figures — with 10 points. 
UCSD snapped Sonoma’s three-game 
win streak, and the team fell to 8-9 
overall and 6-6 in the conference. 

UCSD will play its next four games 
at home, starting with Cal Poly Po-
mona on Thursday. The game will be 
at RIMAC Arena and is scheduled for 
5:30 p.m.

SWIMMING & DIVING — 
UCSD honored its 10 graduating 
members with a victory sendoff 
against Cal Baptist University at 
Canyonview Pool on Jan. 23. 

The Tritons maintained their 
focus despite the emotional nature 
of the home finale. The men’s 
team emerged victorious over the 
Lancers 173-127, while the women 
won 15 of 16 events to take a 231-
66 victory in the team’s penultimate 
matchup of the season.

“It feels really good,” head 
coach Scott McGihon said. “On 
the women’s side, we had some 
really good performances — and 
it was really good to get in today, 
especially since we only have one 
more meet before conference 
champions. As far as the men, it’s 
the first time we’ve ever beaten Cal 
Baptist, and we had tremendous 

performances from [them] too.”
The men’s and women’s 200-

yard medley teams came off the 
blocks with two quick victories, 
setting the tempo for the Tritons. 

“They’re in our conference,” 
coach McGihon said. “So we see 
them at conference championships. 
We’ve beaten them there, just never 
in a dual meet. It just shows the 

great depth we have on the team.”
Freshman Beth Dong followed 

the early victories by capturing 
first place in the 1000-yard 
freestyle with a time of 10:29.06 
— 14 seconds ahead of the next 
closest competitor. Dong went on 
to win the 500-yard freestyle with 
a decisive time of 5:08.34.

Senior Jereme Barnett-Woods 
won the 1,000-yard freestyle by 11 
seconds, posting a 9:48.23 time. He 
later returned to the pool to notch 
a victory in the 500-yard freestyle 
with a time of 4:42.66.

The Tritons swept the entire 
podium in the men’s and women’s 
100-yard breaststroke. Senior Juan 
Pablo Carrillo touched in first with 
a time of 56.40, four seconds ahead 
of his closest teammate.

UCSD also took the top three 
spots in the 200-yard butterfly, 
seeing sophomore Alex Henley

MEN’S BASKETBALL — Coming off a 
double-overtime thriller at home against 
San Francisco State on Jan. 16, the 
UCSD men’s basketball team sought to 
carry its momentum against Humboldt 
State and Sonoma State on Jan. 21 and 
Jan. 23, but was ultimately swept away 
by both teams.

The Tritons lost 66-78 to Sonoma 
State at Sea Wolf Gymnasium on Jan. 
23, and fell 60-74 to Humboldt State at 
Lumberjack Gym on Jan. 21. The two 
losses put the Tritons at 4-10 overall 
and 3-8 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play.

Senior guard Jordan Lawley put on 
a stellar performance 
Saturday, scoring 28 
points, five boards and 
three assists. Lawley 
went nine-of-19 from 
the field, scoring 18 of 
his 28 points in the first 
half alone.

Senior guard Tyler 
Acevedo sent in eight 
points of his own, and 
freshman forward 
Justin Brue had a solid 
game off the bench, 
racking up seven points 
and six rebounds in just 
16 minutes of play. 

The Tritons shot at 
43 percent overall. 

The Seawolves led 
by as many as nine 
points in the first half, 
but UCSD battled back 
to make it a tight game. 
The match saw 11 total 
ties and eight lead 
changes.

After Brue grabbed 
the lead 56-55 on a jump shot, Sonoma 
regained control with a three-pointer 
and pair of free throws. UCSD never 
came within seven points for the rest of 
the game, and eight Sonoma free throws 
in the final minute put the nail in the 
coffin for the Tritons. 

“For both games, we came out 
really strong and competed with an 
early lead,” sophomore guard Jay Wey 
said. “But as the game progressed, our 
intensity trailed off and we ended up 
coming up short. Both games had too 
many turnovers, and we had trouble 
rebounding defensively when it 
mattered. We are a young team that is 
getting better though, and I’m expecting 
good things [for] these upcoming games 
leading up to the Spirit Night game.”

On Thursday, the Lumberjacks scored 
24 points off of 18 Triton turnovers. 
Humboldt also took a 26-8 advantage on 
bench scoring.

UCSD shot at 50 percent while 
Humboldt shot at 48 percent; however, 
the opponents were plus-nine at the 
charity line. 

Lawley, the conference’s leading 
scorer, did all he could for UCSD, scoring 
30 points after matching a career-high 31 
against San Francisco State. However, 
Lawley needed more help from the 
supporting cast, who combined for just 
30 points behind him. Acevedo was 
three-of-nine from the field for nine 

UCSD SUFFERS 
BACK-TO-BACK 
ROAD LOSSES
IN CONFERENCE

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
women suffered their first loss of the season 
on Jan. 21, falling 84-80 to Humboldt State. 
However, the Tritons bounced back well from 
the loss, pulling away in the second half of 
Saturday night’s game to defeat Sonoma State 
68-52. 

On Thursday, Humboldt powered past the 
Tritons, riding on outstanding performances 
from center Brittney Taylor and guard Andrea 
Bobic, who together scored 53 of the Lumber-
jacks’ total 80 points. Taylor had a game-high 
28 points and 10 rebounds, and Bobic added 
25 points on nine-of-15 shooting — including 
seven-of-13 from beyond the arc. 

The Tritons took a 37-35 lead into halftime, 
but the Lumberjacks caught fire from field in 
the second half, converting over 50 percent 
of their shots. Though the team trailed by as 
many as nine points in the second half, a basket 
by sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle tied the 
game with 3:09 remaining. Humboldt respond-
ed with a 6-0 run over the next two minutes to 
seal its victory. 

California Collegiate Athletics Association 
leading scorer Carlisle weighted the Triton 
score with 22 points, while senior guard An-
nette Ilg scored 19 points and junior forward 
Tiffany Hunter added 14 points and three steals.

The final score was the second highest point 
total in any game so far this season, and it was 
in those last moments — when the game turned 
into a shootout — that the Tritons could not 
keep up with the Lumberjacks. 

“We have worked so hard to maintain a per-
fect record, and to have it thrown away from 
one bad game made us all really upset,” said 
Hunter. “It showed us that when we don’t play 
our defensive game, then we aren’t as good.”

The Tritons’ first loss of the season put 
them at 14-1 overall and 9-1 in conference play. 
Humboldt moved to 11-4 overall and 9-2 in the 
CCAA.

The Tritons bounced back in a big way 
against Sonoma State on Saturday, winning 
the game by a landslide after outscoring the 
Seawolves 34-21 in the second half. Sonoma 
scored the opening bucket, but senior forward 
Erin Noonan quickly responded with one of her 
own, and the Tritons never looked back.

The team was led once again by Carlisle, 
who totaled 21 points on six-for-nine shoot-
ing. Noonan and junior forward Tiffany Hunter 
each added 10 points for UCSD, while Ilg con-
tributed nine points and a game-high eight re-
bounds. 

UCSD led by as many as 12 points in the first 
half, but a Sonoma rally in the final two minutes
