LlTlGAnON: State Medical 
Board begins probe following 
unreported malpractice suits 
By Jonn. P8Imer 
Senior Staff Writer 

A San Diego Union-Tribune investigative 
report on lawsuits filed Itaainst the UCSD School 
of Medicine Dean John Alksne has created a 
storm of response from University of California 
officials and members of·the medical commu-
nity. 

The Nov. 17 article was an in-depth investi-

HAT TRICK 

gation int~$4.3 million of medical malpractice 
settlements which alleged negligence on the 
part of Alksne, who has worked as a 
neurosurgeon at UCSD the last 12 years. Pay-
ments for the six settlements were made by UC 
insurers over the same period. 

According to Debby Wiseman, the director 
of Risk Management at the UCSD Medical 
Center, "when a physician is sued, an insurance 
company or a physician making a payment was 
required to report anything over $30,000." 

However, the settlements connected to 
Alksne were neverreported to the Medical Board

A.S. Settles 
Financial 
Review of 
Coops 
MONEY: A.S. and co-ops 
temporarily avoid audit, 
postponed until 1995 
By HIM IIoIChton 
Staff Writer 

The Associated Students agreed to allow 
campus co-ops to use a financial review to fufill 
the audit requirement of the AS./Graduate Stu-
dent Association (GSA)/Co-op Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) this week. 

The co-ops had objected to the audi tthat A. S. 
was requiring because they said that it was 
unnecessary and they that they would not be able 
to afford it. 

"A review is a good compromise. This year, 
we 're still so close to the financial burden. 
We' re trying to recoup ourselves from the legal 
problems [we had]," said Chloe Carroll -Burke, 
a member of the Groundworks Book collective. 

Carrll-Burke said that the co-ops would pre-
fer a review because it costs approximately 
$1 ,200 compared to about $5,000 for an audit. 

AS. President Carla 't;esak said the AS. and 
GSA demanded the audit because the A.S. and 
GSA are financially liable for the co-ops in the 
case of a bankrup.tcy, they require a high assur-
ance of the co-ops' financial solvency. 

Carroll-Burke said she had felt betrayed be-
cause the A.S. and GSA were demanding an 
audit, even though she said that the co-ops had 
understood that a review would be acceptable. 
Sheadded that an outside party has overlooked 
the co-op's financial books for the last three 
years and found no major problems. 

"Groundworks has been in existence for over 
20 years," she said. "We have never had any 
embezzlement problems or [worker's] com-
plaints." 

Carroll-Burke said the contlict began after 
the co-ops agreed to the use of the term audit in 
the MOU. She said the co-ops thought the word 
"audit" was a general term but later realized the 
legal implications it carried. 

Tesak and GSA President Laura Kaelke both 
said that the word "audit" was not a general term 
in a Nov. 21 memo to Carroll-Burke. 

"[W]e did not agree to a review. We ... dis-
cussed this issue with Paul [Phillips, campus 
internal auditor manager], on Nov. 18, 1994.

Future of Physical Education Uncertain for New Year 
RECREAnON: Faculty 
concerned with cost to 
students of classes 
By ...... McR_ St." Writer 

Becoming the latest casualty of

iuue lilt sprinl- The qualion now

will come of the faculty and classes 
of the soon-defunct department 

According to P.E. Supervisor 
Charles Millenl?ah, most of the re-
cent suggestions have centered 
around the possibility of merging 
the P.E. Department's faculty and 
courses into the Recreation Depart· 
ment. In the event of a merger, 
courses would no Ionler be avail-
able to students throup telephone 
reptration. 

SIucIeacs may allo be required to 
pey additional fea for recreation 

classes, which Millenbah said would 
be similar to other classes currently 
offered through the Recreation De-
partment. 

"Next quarter , [recreation 
classes] could cost between $37 and 
552. The students will get half off," 
Millenbah said. 

"I don't think the students are 
lOin, to pay 537 for a basketball 
class. I think they oupt to work 
something out where they give the 
students a break. I don't think that 
520, 530, $40 is a break for the 

students," Millenbah added. 
However, several members of 

the P.E. department said that they 
believe the charges would be unfa ir 
to students. 

"The ~E. department is funded 
by state instructional funds," said 
P.E. Supervisor Barry Cunningham. 
" It isn 't justifiable. Why would they 
charge students to take classes that 
are already funded by the state and 
are specifically earmarked for in-
struction?"

be able to double that." door-Io-door at the Warren apart-

One department on campus, 
Businessand Financial Servlccs, has 
already distributed over 100 orna-
ments. According to Yoshizumi, its 
success is due to the persistence of 
Jonathan Kim, an accountant with 
General Accounting. 

"I like kids, and I don 't want 
them to go without," Kimsaid. "Plus 
it wasn 't that much work to get 
people to give. I just sent out a 
message and I had about 100 people 
respond. Plus, about half of the 
people are buying more than one 
gift, so I estimate that we'll be able 
to collect about 150 gifts." 

The ages of the children range 
from infants to 17-year-olds. Ac-
cording to Voshizumi, youngerchil-
dren usually ask for Barbie Dolls or 
action figures while older children 
generally ask for gift certificates or 
CDs. "And all of them want 
rollerblades," she said. 

Although some of the gifts which 
the ch i Idren ask for are expensive, a 
gift wish can be found for any size 
budget and often several people buy 
one gifl.

food will then be donated to Catho-
lic Charities. "This organization 
helps anyone who needs it," Carol 
Jaramillo of RDAC said. "They 
don't screen people, they just help 
anyone who comes in the door." 

Jaramillo said that RDAC de-
cided on a canned food drive be-
cause "We all have a lot, and this 
gives us a 'chance to share a little bit 
of what we have and lets us reach 
out to the community." 

The Holiday Project, organized 
by the Volunteer Connection, brings 
students to the Vetrans Center and 
convelescent homes for visits and 
singing. "We really need more vol-
unteers for this program," said Molly 
Haney, the director of the Volunteer 
Connection. Other programs that 
need volunteers during the holiday

Scientists have discovered that the Indian Ocean. 
like the Pacific Ocean, experiences an "EI Nliio· 
phenomenon. or cyclical Shifts. in upper-ocean tem-
perature which dramatically affect.theworld's weather. 
The discovery of a possibly global system of the EI 
Niiio/Southem Oscillation (ENSO) could help scien-
tists use the phenomenon to more accurately predict 
EI Nino-spawned floods, storms and drouihts around 
the world. 

The research was conducted by Yves M. Tourre, a 
research meteorologist at Columbia University'S 
lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and professor at 
Westem Connecticut State University, and Warren B. 
White. a research oceanographer at the Scripps Insti-
tution of Oceanography. The results of the research will 
be published In the Joumal of Physical OcelJllOftaphy. 

In their research, the scientists analyzed global 
ocean temperature changes from 1979-91, using 
more than 650.000 measurements collected by c0m-
mercial ships. fishing boats, research boats and naval 
warships. 

ENSO Is an Irrecular cycle which repeats every 3-7 
years, during which global wind pattems and pools of 
warm water shift from one side of the equatorial 
oceans to another. This shifting Is associated with 
corresponding displacements In rainfall and windS. 

Historically, the warming of surface waters off 
South Amerlca's west coast was called EI NI~ (the 
Child), since the phenomenon usually coincided with 
Christmas 

Usi,. records of both surface ' and subsuiface 
temperatures, Tourre and White analyzed the Pacific, 
Indian and Atlantic Oceans separately. They then 
compared the ENSO patterns and discovered there 

, were IInkaees over the entire .lobal-tropIcaI ocean. 
The recoenltlon of an EI Nino pattem In the Indian 

Ocean could lead to forecasting rainfall In the Austral-
Asia reeion 6-12 months In advance, accordlne to the 
researchers.

COMMENTARIES: PROPOSITION 187 - THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN, BUT WHAT DID THEY SAY? 

HUMANE 
RATIONALITY LoST 

B~ Li ... Wei •• 
C:oatributblK OpinioD Writer 

I t is surprising and horrifying that so many Californians agreed with Proposition 187, 
the cold-hearted proposal to curb 
"illegal" immigration, on Election 
Day. Proposition 187 violates the 
human rights of undocumented 
immigrants and wrongly accuses 
them of being the cause of the 
state's financial difficulties. The 
foundation of this initiative 
resembles the harsh punishments 
administered to criminals. Under 
this law, undocumented 
immigrants will inevitably 
experience unjust and possibly 
inhumane treatment. 

Many researchers confirm that

expenditures, which have a 
tendency to be inefficiently 
spent, before it attempts to 
solve its financial problems 
by harassing 
undocumented immigrants 
and ignoringtheirbasichuman 
needs. 

Proposition 187, and its 
mentality, defy the very 
principles of democracy and 
freedom on whi£h the United 
States was built. The 1982 U.S. 
Supreme Court's decision in 
Plyer vs. Doe affirmed that the 
denial of public education to 
undocumented children is a

schools as a result of several 
provisions which violate federal

when people's basic education and 
health needs are denied, they will 
involuntarily become a burden to 
the state. 

How can expelli ng students who 
do not have "legal" documentation 
from public schools and 
universities help the state 
financially? Withholding the right 
to education is a form of 
unconstitutional control. People 
who are denied education will have

The defenders of this initiative 
claim that it does not concern

COMMENTARY: During the holiday season, food takes on a particularly large role in our lives, brightening every 
occasion to eat; but to someone who suffers from anorexia nervosa, each of these occasions is painfully difficult to bear 

DETERIORATION FROM Loss OF APPETITE 
By Amy 1'hoInM 
ContrlbutitW Opinion Writer 

Holiday rituals involve not only 
spending time with our families 
and friends, but also a complex 
social system of eating. Food livens 
the generic Christmas party, pads 
the sometimes-tense family 
gatherings and warms the 
seasonally cold winter festivities. 
Holiday food makes life at this time 
of year seem a bit richer. 

If the pumpkin pie were to be 
taken from Thanksgiving and the 
fruitcake from Christmas, these 
holidays would just not be the same. 
If we deny ourselves the many 
different selections of treats, we are 
then resisting our traditions. 

It is this time of year which 
makes a certain group in our society 
very upset, nervous and scared. To 
this group, consisting largely of 
young girls, the holidays are a time 
of anxiety and animosity, nota time 
to celebrate with a glass of eggnog 
or slice ofwann apple pie. To these 
girls, food is an object of contempt: 
No pleasure shall be taken in its 
presence. Holiday goods send their

lives spinning out of control. For 
those who are clinically categorized 
as "anorexic,"the holidays can be a 
living hell. 

Anorexia Nervosa is an 
emotionally caused loss of appetite. 
It is a syndrome which mainly affects 
young women from middle- and 
upper-class families, though it also 
affects some men. The lifestyle of 
an anorexic may start with resistance 
to certain types of foods, usually 
sweets such as candy, cookies, cakes 
and ice cream. The list of foods 

w~ich an anorexic contemptuously 
avoids soon builds to include any 
fats such as dairy products, meats 
and oils. After only a short time, she 
may subsist solely on shreds of 
lettuce, water and half of a bagel, 
and her life includes many hours of 
exercise. 

Dr. Joan Brumberg, director of 
women's studies at Cornell 
University, estimates that 10 percent 
of, American women have eating 
disorders, and that on college 
campuses, the number often exceeds 
20 percent. "College students today 
are more promiscuous about food 

equal human rights. 
In addition, Proposition 187 

unfairly expects California workers 
to serve as immigration police, 
searching for "illegal aliens" in the 
workplace. It asks them to invade 
people's privacy. Educators, medical 
workers and police would be strained

than they are about sex," said 
Brumberg. 

Oearly, any student who is prone 
to an eating disorder can be affected 
by the off-beat eating patterns which 
accompany a college lifestyle. 

by this requirement. 
One Los Angeles police detective 

commented in the LA. Times, "I 
don't have enough detectives to 
cbeck on my murders. So how am I 
going to keep track of that 
administrative lunacy? U's not our 
job to ask people where they are 

Anorexia is a disease which 
shreds a woman's personality to 
pieces, because she focuses entirely 
on the outward appearance of her 
body when she should be growing 
spiritually and mentally. 

Joan Sweeny of the L.A. Times 
stated, "Victims of anorexia nervosa 
so intensely fear becoming obese 
that they starve themselves, usually 
losing 25 percent or more of their 
body weight." Anorexia may even 
drive women to the point where 
"they may be very pleased with their 
appearance when they are so 
emaciated they look like inmates of 
a Nazi concentration camp." 
Anorexia nervosa can swallow a 
strong girl and leave behind II 
helpless and weight-obsessed 
victim. 

I know someone who is anorexic 
and it hurts me every time I look at 
her small body and see the definition 
of her spine. When we eat, all she 
orders is plain white rice, which she 
so gingerly places in her mouth grain 
by grain. 

I, too, almost succumbed to the 
glamour of the disease. Not only am 

from. We aren't the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service." 

The passage of Proposition 187 
foreshadows a grim chain of future 
anti-"illegal" immigration policies. 
It confuses values of equality and 
human dignity with its own 
financial agenda. 

I forced to see the claws of anorexia 
grip and ruin the life of someone so 
close to my heart, but I can actually 
understand the perverse mentality 
behind it. Worse yet,l am saddened 
to recognize many girls around me 
whQ can make claims similar to my 
own. 

On Thanksgiving, everyone at 
the dinner table was enjoying plates 
loaded with food, while this girl 
miserably left the table after having 
placed only a forkful of cranberry 
sauce in her mouth. The need to be 
thin and the hate of food have 
consumed her life. 

This girl chills easily, tires at 
early hours of the night and lacks 
enough energy ~ keep up a 
conversation. Sometimes, it is scary 
to recognize these feelings as my 
own, because I still experience some 
of these conditions. Anorexia 
separates us only by a thin line: the 
fact that I can eat with 'slightly less 
reservation than she. My hope this 
season is that I can coax her,lure her 
or even trick her into crossing this 
line, so that she may join me on the 
other side. 

California should continue to 
challenge this discriminatory policy 
and incorporate the ideas of equality 
and respect for humanity into its 
laws. Only then willourstate reflect 
the values of justice, freedom and 
democracy on which this country is 
founded.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thunday, December 1, 1994 

MISLEADING LETTER NEEDS CLARIFICATION 
IIdItor. 

I am not alone when I say Ben 
Katz was audacious to write a letter 
to the Guardian (" Moskovics 
Should Not Resign," Nov. 21 ) filled 
with misinformation and mislead-
ing arguments. The smoking issue 
is dead at Muir, but this is not about 
the smoking issue. This letter is sim-
pi y a clarification which Katz is not 
willing to write himself. 

Katz contend that Stuart 
Moskovics isadedicated leader who 
has organized a "multitude of ac-
tivities," not mentioning that some 
activitie he listed occurred while 
Moskovics was a member, not the 
chair. and therefore was part of a 

• group effort . 
Katz also stated that I "placed 

my desire to smoke over everything 
else," which is wrong. I am not a 
smoker and never have been. In fact, 
cigarette smoke bothers me and I 
have put the fight for smokers to 
have a place to eat over my "per-
sonal desire" not to eat around smok-
ers. If Katz would have bothered to 
ask me or do any research at all, he 
would have known this. His point 
was an accusatory assumption. 

Katz ' point that Moskovics would 
have been negl igent in his duties if he 
voted how the Commuter -Council 
wanted him to is also misleading. The 
students who attend the council meet-

ings are the commuter student leaders 
and should not be ignored. Further-
more, Katz failed to do research about 
George Ellis and his "[failure) to vote 

in agreement with the Residents' 
Council." There was no official vote 
taken in the Residents' Council, only 
a straw poll which was split. Ellis did 
as he should have: He listened to the 
opinions of the residents and then 
voted accordingly. Ellis served the 
people he represents while Moskovics 
served himself. 

Katz accuses me of being vindic-
tive for wanting Moskovics to re-
sign for not doing his job. He backs 
up this argument by quoting my 
letter, wherein a Commuter Council 
member was quoted as saying, 
"Moskovics' little group is so vin-
dictive." He did not attribute this to 
an outside source, but instead led 

readers to believe that I had stated it. 
Katz's letter is full of lies. This is 

the way he "represents" the students 
of Muir IS their MCC member-at-
large. In the words of Katz, "It is a 
sad day for Muir College." I con-
fronted Katz about the issues in his 
letter and he said, "I'm s6rry that it 
[the letler] came out." He also of-
fered to write a clarification to the 
GuardiDn which he has since de-
clined to do. I guess Katz thinks 
he'll never get to Congress if he has 
a public record of apologizing for 
his mistakes. I guess he doesn't re-
alize this is the only way he will ever 
earn anyone's respect.

campaign and will continue to act in 
defense ofthe labor and human rights 
of our migrant workers." Notice the 
careful wording. He avoids any 
reference to the term "illegal 
immigranl." This is because De 
Gortari, like many other Latinos, 
seem to assume that because 
Cal ifomia once belonged to Mexico, 
Mexicans have the right to enter the 
United States without any 
documentation and that theirstay here 
requires that we provide them with 
free public services. This is as 
ridiculous as arguing that, because 
the stllte of New York once belonged 
to England, English people arriving 
in New York without any 
documentation automatically deserve 
the rightto free public services. What 
the opposition to Proposition 187 
overlooks is that free public services 
are not a right, but a privilege, as is 
entering the United States. 

Many of those who voted for 
Proposition 187 were themselves 
immigrants - but they were legal 
immigrants. These people had to 
wait for years to recei ve ex it v isas to 
leave their countries of origin, and 
for permission from the American 
government to enter the United 
States. They then had to wait five 
more years to gain American 
citizenship. They realized that all 
this was in vain, if many illegal 
immigrants receive state-funded 
services such as medical care for 
free, while many legal immigrants 
have to pay for such benefits . 

There is a difference between 
legal and illegal immigration into 
the United States. The initiative's 
opposition tends to lu mp the two into 

one Cltegory ,labeling tlfe proposition 
IS "anti-immigrant," while ignoring 
the fact that the measure says 
absolutely nothing about barring 
legal immigration. It also says 
nothing aboui barring Latinos or any 
other ethnic group from immigrating 
into the United States; opponents' 
charges of "racism" and kethnic 
intolerance," on the part of the 
proposition 's supporters, are 
unfounded. And yes, calling people 
who sneak into this country without 
any documentation "illegal " is 
accurate, because they break U.S. 
law to get into the United States. 
When an individual wants to live or 
work in any country other than his 
own, he should either respect that 
country 's lawsor not enterat all. The 
only exception to th is is in the case of 
refugees , who flee their homes 
because of persecution, but the vast 
majority of illegal imm igrants in 
California do not fall into this 
category. 

Between education, medical care, 
law enforcement and corrections, 
and limited public assistance, the 
1.6 billion illegal immigrants who 
reside in California cost the tate 
nearly $3 billion per year. Clearly, 
the flood of illegal takes its toll on 
our economy. 

An editorial in the Sail Diego 
Unioll Tribullestates , " It 'sone thing 
to rail against illegal immigrants. 
It 's quite another to fire them all and 
leave their jobs undone . Are 
Californians really ready for that?" 
On Nov . 8, California's voters 
overwhelmingly showed that they 
are indeed ready. It's time to take 
illegal immigration serious ly . 
Though Proposition 187 may not be 
perfect. its enactment would bring 
us one notch closer to this goal.

Who's the 
True Champ? 

Well, here we are at the end 
of yet another college football 
season, and we have absolutely 
no clue who the national 
champion will be. What will it 
take for the universities and 
sponsors to set aside their own 
personal interests and anange 
a playoff system to determine 
a real national champion? 

Who knows? Then again, 
maybe I'm the one who should 
be checked for a brain tumor. 
Thinking these people would 
do something to improve the 
sport, rather than their 
investment in it, is rather 
foolish. That's like trying to 
rangle a side of beef away 
from a mad dog which hasn't 
been fed in two days. 

The universities and 
sponsors, hereafter refened to 
as the greedy bums, attempted 
to pacify the sports fans' desire 
for a true title game through 
the creation of a bowl coali-
tion. This coalition would 
supposedly guarantee a true 
national championship game. 
However, the coalition's 
method for determining what 
teams will play on New Year's 
Day has a painful similarity to 
the NFL's system for rating 
quarterbacks: Namely, that 
Einstein couldn't derive either 
of these formulas. 

It seems that the bowl 
coalition left a major gap in its 
plan to match up the top two 
teams on Jan. 1: EVERY 
OTHER DAMN BOWL. 
Because many bowls still have 
contracts with conferences 
means that the bowl coalition 
is far from assured that the 
top-two teams will be available 
to play on New Years Day. 

This year, for example, 
Nebraska will be spending Jan. 
1 at the Orange Bowl, while 
number-two Penn State will be 
sunning itself on the opposite 
coast at the Rose Bowl. 

Then there's the problem 
which arises when there are 
more than two undefeated 
teams, as is also the case this 
year. Alabama is perfect on the 
season and screaming for 
national attention. But the Tide 
seem to be lost in the shuffle 
with all ey~ directed toward 
Pasadena and Miami to see 
whether the Nittany Lions or 
the Cornhuskers will demolish-
their opponent the worst. 

Wow, what excitement. I 
suppose I'll watch the Orange 
Bowl. After all, at least 
Nebraska has to playa top-tO 
team to prove itself. It is ironic 
that, in this first year of the 
bowl coalition, everything that 
could possibly have happened 
to prevent a true national 
championship game has. 
Perhaps after five more 
seasons of futility, the -greedy 
burns" will see the error of 
their ways and put their pea 
sized brains to the tuk of 
aeatinaa playoff system.

Polo Takes Top Guns to Final 

Top Photo:

·He stepped In and took 
tNer as a team leader way 
back in April. He is a class 
act both as a player and 
person and has really led 
the program with his 
respected leadership" 

Mike YaIIech 
"He has been a tr~ 
dous leader both in the 
pool and out. His nickname 
is 'Bul!do&' and I have 
never coached a more 
intense player. He has 
been very responsible, for 
our success this season .• 

It was not supposed to be the year ,of 
the Triton for the UCSD men's water polo 
team. 

-We go't off to a slow start," UCSD 
Head Coach Denny Harper said. "And 
some people were saying that we weren't 
going to be competitive, but after three 
weeks or so, we turned it around." 

The Tritons ended up advancing to the 
Western Water Polo Association tourna-
ment final against Air Force, after blow-
ing out OIapman, 18-10, and UC Davis, 
14-7. UCSD was narrowly edged out in 
the final by the Falcons, 6-5, but accord-
ing to Harper, "We didn't so much lose as 
we did just run out of time. " 

Air Force was a thorn in the Tritons' 
side all year long, but the Falcons were 
part in one of UCSD's biggest season high-
lights. After falling to the Falcons in a 
morning game at the Mount Baldy tour-
nament, the 12th-ranked Tritons came back 
to defeat number II University of 
Massachussetts that afternoon. 

.. It's not easy to rebound like a loss 
from that and come back to beat a higher-
ranked team," Harper said. 

Despite the team's slow start, Harper 
said he never gave up on the season. "I 
don't believe in rebuilding years. It's not 
a term that is in my coaching vocabulary," 
Harper said. -At the end of the season we 
were playing so well, we had the potential 
to bCat anybody, especially at home. 

o -The Air Force coach came up to us 
after the WWPAgame and said that UCSD 
was the most-improved team in the 
NCAA," the coach continued. 

With a bright future ahead, Harper is 
quick to acknowledge the team's present. 
-We had an excellent year that had the po-
tential to be one of our best years ever," 
Harper said. -It was a fun year to coach 
and I'm very proud of our accomplish-
ments."

Cross Country Cruising 
It was a season of growth and triumph 

for the UCSD cross country team. And 
perhaps the best part about t 994 is that 
almost everyone will be back in 1995. 

But that doesn't mean the seniors won't 
be missed. After all, the Triton distance 
runners sprinted through their tough sched-
ule with an equal mix of veteran leader-
ship and freshman vigor. 

"It happens every year," Head Coach 
Ted Van Arsdale said. "But each time 

, someone graduates, it leaves an enormous 
hole on the team." 

The season started with the Aztec In-
vite, in which the UCSD men's squad set 
the tone for the season with a fifth-place 
finish, while the UCSD women took ninth. 
At the Stanford Invite on Oct. I, a youth-
ful duo of Kyndra Smith and Melissa Rob-
erts emerged, leading the women to eighth. 

The CCAA Championships furthe, 
showcased the Triton women's progress, 
and both the men's and women's squads 
vaulted to third place. 

At the NCAA Regionals on Nov. 12th, 
the UCSD men's squad exploded into first 
place to advance to nationals. 

NCAA Nationals was the .. J.J. Castner 
show," as the long-distance veteran dashed 
to the fourth-best finish in the nation.

Some games are over early on, but this 
one was ridiculous. The Triton women's 
basketball team crushed ue Santa Cruz, 

89-47, on Saturday 
night and then watched 
as Mills College for· 
feited on Sunday. 

It turns out that 
Mills has a small team, 
and when two of its 
players fell victim to 
the flu and a third suf-
fered a separated shoul-

forfeit Sunday 's game.

home after getting just one game under 
its belt. The triumph over the Banana 
Slugs boosted the Tritons record to 2·1 
going into a contest with Pomona-Pitzer 
on Dec. 3. 

"We played really well in the first 
half," Head Coach Judy Malone said. 
"Everybody got playing time for us." 

UCSD's Marcia Jeffires was on fire in 
the first half of the victory over uesc, 
raining in 17 points on seven of eight 
shooting. Although Jeffires did all her 
scoring in the opening stanza, it was 
plenty as the Tritons ran away from the 
Slugs in the second half. 

Tami Oviatt also came up big for 
UCSD, tallying 16 points and pulling 
down five rebounds from her forward 
position .

College three 

times, and the number-one team in 
the state, San Jose Stale, once. 

"We've had a very lough first 
half of the season," team captain 
Steve Schwartz said. "But we're 
turning things around." 

Last weekend 's game brought . 
victim number·one on the Triton 
comeback trail. The UCSD skaters 
clobbered Long Beach State. 5-3, to 
earn their first win of. the season, 
raising their record to 1·7. 

The conlest certainly had its 
share of drama. Long Beach 
benched its goalie in the lasl period

4-3 battle. BUIlhe Tritons responded 
by hitting an empty-net goal with 
1:30 left to play.

"It feels good to slart off the

confident that we' lI repeat as

captain Brian Sanders said. 

UCSD's closest competitor 
was UCSB, which fell by a 128·

UCSD's men with a third·place 
finish, closely followed by senior 
Charles Golden in fifth. 

Tara Larkins captured first 
place for the San Diego women, 
while Andrew Fasseden grabbed 
a third· place finish in the body-
boarding competition. 

"The team surfed weirall day, 
consistently placing in the top of 
their heats," Golden said.

UCSD's 'A' 
team roared to a perfect 4-0 mark 
on the weekend, with victories over 
Redlands (11·2), Occidental Col-
lege (11·1) and the UCSB 'B' team 
(13·7). 

The most impressive victory of 
the weekend, however, came against 
the UCSB 'A' squad, which UCSD 
downed by a dominating 13-6 tally. 
Santa Barbara, a traditional power-
house in ultimate, reached last 
year's national semi·fl.nals and was 
in the finals two years ago. 

The teams were in a tight battle 
early in the game, with Santa Bar-
bara grabbing the advantage at 6-5. 
However, UCSD responded by 
scoring the next eight points to earn 
the win. It was the first time in five 
seasons that San Diego had con-
quered UCSB.

included Brad Shafer and Brian 
Qualls, while the defensive effort 
was spearheaded by Oren Doron, 
Erik Kupperman and Ben "Assorted

The UCSD 'B' team earned 
valuable experience in the tourna-
ment, battling the same three oppo: 
nents and coming away with a 1·3 
record. 

The 'B' team fell victim to the 
tough UCSB 'A' squad by a 12·3 
margin and was also unable to tackle 
the UCSB 'B' team, falling by a 9· 
4 tally. 

San Diego rebounded to grab its 
lone victory of the weekend when 
it squeaked by Redlands University, 
8-6. 

However, Occidental College 
was next up, and it dealt the UCSD 
'B' team its third defeat of the tour-
nament by a six-point margin, 15-
9. 

Despite the 'B' team's rocky 
road through the tourney, ultimate 
co-captain Chris Weaver noted that 
"they gained some valuable experi.

Water Skiing 

It's been a season of gold-
medal performances, top-tO 
rankings, and championship 

~ thoughts " -,.. for the - UCSDwa-ter skiing 
team. 

The Triton skiers began their 
1994 season by crowning their 
first individual conference champ 
in school history, as senior Alison 
Walmsley grabbed the gold medal 
in the women's trick event at the 
Oct. 3 NCWSA Conference 
Champjonships. 

"I am extremely proud of 
[Walmsley's) ability to regain her 
composure," said UCSD Head 
Coach Bill Schneiderwind. "I'm 
proud of all the women trickers." 

Walmsley's efforts paced the 
Triton women to a fourth-place 
finish, while the Triton men cap· 
tured sixth·place overall at that 
meet. 

At the Oct. 24 Crystal Point 
Estates Collegiate Open, the 
whole UCSD squad came home 
with the gold, winning the team 

championship outright with all 
impressive 3,635 total points. 

Freshman Becky Blankinship 
and redshirt freshman Jessica 
Wagenseil provided the sparks for 
the Tritons this time, as the out-
come of the meet depended on the 
women's jump event. 

Blankinship took seventh 
place, while Wagenseil vaulted 
into fourth place, giving UCSD the 
uncontested championship. 

The Triton skiers' outcome at 
the Big Spray Open on Oct. 31 
showed that their :win at Crystal 
Point was no fluke. UCSD again 
earned first·place overall with 
3625 total points. 

Senior Bill Berk led the Triton 
men with a tie for first in the men's 
trick event, while Walmsley turned 
in another solid, second·place, in· 
dividual performance for the 
women. 

"The team overall, and espe-
cially the women, have really im-
proved," team member Jen Stern 
said. "We're going to be really 
strong in the spring."

UCSD rugby has had a tough 
preseason, which included battles 
against teams from Camp Pendelton

Nothing's ever certain in this

Take, for in·

on Nov. 12-13, the

in a dual meet. 
UCSD split the games against its 

two cross-town rivals, winning both 
of the 'B' games while dropping 
both of the' A' contests. USD con-
quered UCSD by a score of 17'() and 
SDSU then pounded the Tritons by 
a score of 25·0 in the 'A' games. 
UCSD rebounded well, however, 
downing USD's 'B' squad, 16-0, 
and dominating SDSU's second 
team, 20-3. 

The Tritons posted a 3-4 record 

Intersectional race, held in sail-
friendly Santa Barbara, proved to be 
an excellent start of the season for 
UCSD. 

"It was our kick-off meet; Pettit 
said. "And it was a lot of fun." 

Armed with a sparkling new boat 
to replace its old eight-year model, 
UCSD began the meet in full stride. 
Thanks to the strength of several 
'returning members, the Tritons 
fared weU in Saturday's initial races. 

"Sailing on Saturday was ter·

The Tritons' success continued 

into Sunday's final match ups. Rac-
ing alongside boats from top schools 
in California and Hawaii, the UCSD 
squad held its own. "Sunday was a

a lot of racing in," Petit said. 

With their first race behind them, 
Ihe Tritons now have some time to

the results of their first regatta, but 
their next race is over a month away.

Little Women is the story of the four 
March sisters and their next-door

family. Set in New England in the 
1860s, the film also stars Susan 
Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne, Samantha 
Mathis and Kirsten Dunst, the prom-
ising young actress from Interview

seeks a new audience for a classic 
story. 

with his boss (Demi Moore). When 
Douglas is charged with sexual ha-
rassment, he seeks the help of a savvy 
woman lawyer. In this highly antici-
pated film based on Michael 
Crichton's best-selling novel of the 
same name, Douglas once again be-
comes a symbol for angry, "isenfran-
chised white men. Moore plays the 
evil seductress-boss everyone loves 
to hate. With its controversial subject, 
this is the perfect film for Crichton 
fans and anyone who's sick of happy 
holiday movies.

-• MIxed Nuta: Based on a French 
movie entitled (in translation) Father 
Xmas Is a Shit, Mixed Nuts is about 
Philip (Steve Martin) and his suicide 
hotline staff during the Christmas sea-
son. The suicide hotline center is a 
hotbed of unrealized yearnings and 
fantasies, which directly reflects the 
world with which the staffers deal.

'I1lunday, D-mber 1, 1994 

. VIllI •• (Epic Records): Al-
though Pearl Jam's '60s-inftuenced 
music and singer Eddie Vedder's 
mumbled vocals ~ often annoying, 
the band's integrity has always been 
admirable. 

The group spent the summer fight-
ing Ticketmaster's service charge 
scheme and did not even release a 
singleforillliastalbum Vs, whichlOld 
a record million copies in its first 
week. The releaseoftht much-antici-
pated Vitalogy, originally scheduled 
forearly November, has been delayed 
because of packaging problems, but 
will be in stores on Dec 6. 

The album is the most diverse of 
Pearl Jam's career. From the opening 
sounds of band members tuning their 
instruments, it's apparent that the Se-
attle-based band wants to experiment 
on Vita logy. With spoken word 
("Bugs"), and guitar feedback and 
samples of dialogue ("Hey 
Foxymophandlemama, that's me"), 
Pearl Jam abandons its usual, formu-
laic approach. 

The group sounds almost punk on 
thealbum'sfimsingle"SpintheBIack 
Circle," a song about the thrill of 
spinninganalbumon a turntable (pearl 
Jam has already released Vitalogy on 

vinyl~ 
The band also evokes powerful 

moods on slow-tempo songs such as 
"Tremor Christ," "Nothingman" and 
the quirky, Latin-influenced ilL'ltru-
mental "Aye Davanita. " With Vs,PtarI 
Jam defied critics who thought it 
lacked longevity. With Vitalogy, Pearl 
Jam shows it has the 'potential for a 
vel)' long life indeed.

Beth Gibbons has the sort of sultry 
voice that has made MIlZ)' Star's 
Hope Sandoval so popular. The lite-
techno may be too wimpy for some 
listeners, but the mix of sampled beats 
and keyboards is often intoxicating. 

Plec.. lecarlot (Virgin 
Records): Recently named Artist of 
the Yearby Spin magazi~ ~ Smash-
ing Pumpkins are so popular, they 
could release anything, and it would 
sell. They have virtually done that 
with Pisces, a collection of b-sides 
and outtakes from their last album, 
Siamese Dream. The cover of 
Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide" is 
haunting. but songs such as the 11-
minute "Starla" are finer. 

... tile .... (4 A.D.): Last 
year, Uz Phair was the new female 

singer sensation. This year, it's Lisa 
Germano, the former violinist in John 
Cougar Mellencamp's band. 
Germano's songs about "how to be 
sexual and 0001 in the world" (as she 
writes in the liner notes) are nothing 
short of brilliant. 

....... , ............ 
... (RCA Records): The Dave 
MattJoews Band is another "adult al-
ternative" rock act. LikeToadthe Wet 
Sprocket, American Music Club and 
Grant Lee Buffalo, The Dave 
Matthews Band is one of a number of 
bands which play mellow, folk-influ-
enced music. The South African-born 
Matthews displays his amazing vocal 
talents on songs /lOCh as "Satellite." 

I I .. , ... I fl' • ( I~ I ( .. , 

.................. (Grand 
Royal Records): Although not as raw 
as last year's EP,ln Search of Manny, 
NalUl'rIl mixes sampled beats and live 
music while the band raps about ur-
ban life. The New York-based group 
is one of the best all-female rap acts. It 
will perform on Dec. 4 at the Casbah. 

Loved (Arista Records): Singer 
Alison Shaw has one of those child-
like voices which you either love or 
hate. Like Kate Bush and Cocteau 
Twins' EliDbeth Fraser, Shaw uses 
her voice as an instrument with vary-
ing success. Remixes of the songs 

"Paris and Rome" and "Lilies" sim-
ply make.the album repetitive. 

11M .Iack AlbuM (Warner 
Bros.): Prince originally intended to 
release this album in 1987, but de-
cided not to because it was reported to 
be too sexually explicit, he decided 
not to. Compared-to most "gangster" 
rap, The BIIJcJ:AIbum, which captures 
Prince's George Ointon-influenced 
funk phase, sounds tame. 1M BUJck 
Albwn has been widely bootlegged, 
but this official release will only be 
available until January. 

.., (TVI): Catherine is yet an-
other promising band from Chicago, 
the horne of Smashing PumpkilL'l and 
Liz Phair. The band has actually re-
leased a single with the Smashing 
Pumpkins. The music on Sorry alter-
nates between walls of sonic noise 
and melodic interludes. The first 
single, "Songs about Girls," features 
the perfect balance between noise and 
melody. 

awl hiii"tI,. 
Ruby VrooIn (Slash): The New 

York-based Soul Coughing is one of 
this year's best new acts. Like MC 
900 Foot Jesus, singer M. Doughty 
speaks and sings with fervent energy 
as the band satirizes Hollywood 
dreams ("Screenwriter's Blues") and 
consumer culture ("Casiotone Na-
tion") to a j82Z and hip-ho~inflected 
beat. 

HIATUS 3 

.. ..... (Virgin Records): 
Bryan Ferry spent five years putting 
together the songs on Mamouna . 
While each track features an entou-
rage of musicians, Ferry'seerie musi-
cal landscapes are often listless. Ferry 
will perform on Dec. S at Copley 
Symp'!'>ny Hall. 

...... Pow. (Columbia): For-
merly Big Audio Dynamite, Big Au-
dio has gone through a number of 
name changes. Led by ex-Clash gui-
tarist Mick Jones, Big Audio's music 
hasn't changed along with its name. 
The band still plays a grating mix of 
ska and rock. While thesingle "Look-
ingforaSong" is initially likeable, the 
rest of the album sounds like the same 
song. 

u ......... (Geffen): The six 
cover songs on Nirvana's M7V Un-
plugged in New York are the most 
interesting tracks on the album. Nir-
vana plays three Meal Puppets' tunes, 
David Bowie's "The Man Who Sold 
the World," the Vasolines ' "Jesus 
Doesn't Want me for a Sunbeam" and 
an old L.edbelly track. 

The real starofthe show is vocalist 
Kurt Cobain. He keeps perfect rhythm 
on W About Girl" and screams on "Pen-
nyroyal Tea" and "All Apologies." 
It's unfortunate that Unplugged is the 
last Nirvana album.

ART 
REVIEW 

Egyptian 
Photos 
Orientialist 

issues addressed 
The Orient has long been a seat of 

mystery and fantasy for the Western 
mind. Throughout history, images of 
the Orient have been used to define 
Western culture 's supposed superior-
ity . Literary critic Edward Said has 
used the term Orientalism to describe 
the creation of a mythology to legiti-
mate imperialist practices. The exhi-
bition "Real Hieroglyphics: Photog-
raphy and Egypt 1850-1900" at the 
University Art Gallery examines the 
role of photography in creating West-
ern perceptions about the Orient. 

Egypt's historical significanceand 
renowned monuments made ita popu-
larsitefor 19th<entury photographers 
and the burgeoning tourist industry. 
The prints, stereocards, glass nega-
tives, photo-illustrated travel albums 
and tourist books in the exhibition 
were donated by several museums 
and University of California libraries. 
However, several works were found 
in second-hand shops around San 
Diego by the show's curator, Visual 
Arts Professor Geoffrey Batchen. 
Featured in the exhibit are works by 
photographers Francis Frith, Maxime 
Du Camp, Felix Teynard, the Zengake 
brothers, W. Hammerschmidt and 
Maison Bonfils. 

Through its careful organization, 
"Real Hieroglyphics" addresses the 
Orienta I ist representation of Egypt and 
theeconomicsofcolonialismandtour-
ism. The photographs are hung in 
dense clusters around the gallery ac-
cording to the following headings: 
"Monuments" (all of the famous 
temples, pyramids and monumental 
sculptures); Views (picturesque desert 
landscapes); "Scencs" ("typical" im-
ages of people in their urban environ-
ment); "Relics" (detailsofhieroglyph-
ics and architectural reliefs); and 
"Types" (portraitsof Egyptians in tra-
ditional dress or pose). Interspersed 
among the images are hits of text 
extracted from bot h contemporary and 
19th-century writers. 

Batchen has organized a compre-
hensive and provocative exhibition. 
Without being overly academic or 
didactic, the show successfully pro-
vides an arena to reconsider the repre-

. sentation of Egypt in the Western 
consciousness. "Real Hieroglyphics" 
continues through Dec.15. For more 
information, call 534-2864.

The Jesus Lizard 
Chicago-based band is known for its 

energetic live performances 
By Tony P_~"" 
Staff Writer 

The Jesus Lizard has succeeded 
over the last few years in making a 
name for itself as one ofthe best live 
acts around. The Chicago-based 
quartet has been touring since Au-
gust in support of its latest album, 
Down. In addition to Down, the 
band has released three studio al-
bums (Head, Liar and Goat) and a 
live album (Show). Lead singer 
David Yow and bassist David Sims 
form the nucleus of the group and 
have been playing together since 
1982, when they started their first 
band, Scratc/lAcid, in Austin, Texas. 

The combination of the Lizard's 
pounding music and Yow's stage 

presence has earned the band a loyal 
following. One of the more recent 
converts is '60s icon Dr. Timothy 
Leary who has said, "Every genera-
tion has its exciting band, 

Who: The Jesus Lizard, 
Pegboy, Kepone 
When: Spm Friday, Dec. 9 
Where: SOMA 
How much: $8 in advance 
Info: 239-SOMA 

and they (The Jesus Lizard] are it. 
They make Elvis Presley look like a 
kewpie doll." 

Duringa recent phone interview, 
Yow was subdued as he spoke from 
his home in Chicago. 

~: WhId'. the best 
city ,au"" pIQed SO ... on 
... tour1 

Yow: Tokyo. Everybody was real 
polite. It 's pretty interesting, because 
the Japanese people took a shot at a 
- I hate to use the word - but an 
"alternative" festival: The other 
bands in it were The Boredoms, 
Dog Eat Dog, Helmet and some 
others.

WeU, Austin is pretty great. We 
lived almost allover that city, virtu-
ally on the University of Texas at 
some PQints. I lived there for about 
10 years at the time when there were 
a lot of punk bands down there. The 
Butthole Surfers started up around 
then. There was a pretty 0001 punk 
"scene" at the time.

Well, as far as putting pictures 
of the band on the albums, I think 

that it is fairly unimportant to have 
our faces plastered all over the 
records. With the video thing, we 
have made four videos, and M1V 
hated them all. They really slaugh-
tered them when we sent them in, 
because they thought they were 0b-
scene. I could go on for hours about 
why it hasn't worked with MlV.

We played a show together in 
Hoboken, NJ a couple years ago, 
and I brought up the idea of doing a 
single together. They were still on 
Sub Pop at that time. Then they 
signed with Geffen and turned into 
the BeaUes, so it took awhile to get 
it going with all the Geffen lawyers 
and stuff. 

But as far as working with them, 
we never actually got into the studio 
together. We recorded oursong, they 
recorded theirs, and we basically 
sent them in.
