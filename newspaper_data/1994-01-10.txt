Wilson Budget Calls for Fee Hikes 
By Philip MIc ...... 
News Editor 

Higher fees for students 
throughout the University of Cali-
fornia system became a virtual 
certainty after Gov. Pete \yilson 
released his proposed state budget 
last Friday. 

The Governor's budget calls 
for a $1.8 billion allocation to the 
University of California, an in-
crease of $58 million over the cur-
rent year's. The 3.2 percent boost 
would be the first increase in state 
funding for the university in four 
years. 

"We are very grateful to the 
governor for his proposal. The 3.2 
percent increase represents the best' 

FUNDING: In spite of first increase to university in 
four years, students will face $620 fee increase 

A $620 hike would translate into a 
17 percent increase, and would be 
the eighth fee hike in as many 
years. outcome possible given the state's 

fiscal situation and the incteasing 
demands on state funds," said UC 
President Jack Peltason. 

"[A 3.2 percent increase] is not 
bad," said Student Regent Darby 
Morrisroe during hervisitto UCSD 
on Friday. "It's not good, but it's 
not horrific." 

Nevertheless, the governor's 
proposed funding hike falls short 
of the 8.8 percent increase that the 
Board of Regents had requested in 
November. To balance the bud-
get, the university will rely in part 
on an increase in student fees. 

"Unless there's an extremely 
unique fee policy in the next month 
or so, fee increases are a virtual 
likelihood," Morrisroe said. 
"What's still in doubt is the amount 
[of the increase.]" 

In a telephone conversation 
with members of the University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA) on Friday, UC Budget 
Director Larry Hershman con-
firmed that the Office of the Presi-
dent will propose a fee hike of 
$620 at the January regents ' meet-
ing, according to UCSA Field 
Representative Donny Emerick. 

"That's based on the governor's 
budget projections. Usually in 
spring, things get worse," Emerick 
said . 

Besides the $620 hike in under-
graduate fees, the Office of the 
President will also propose a 
$2,000 fee for new students enter-
ing the graduate professional 
schools of medicine, law, veteri-
nary medicine, business and den-
tistry, UC spokesman Mike Alva 
said. Approximately one-third of

Woman Abducted, 
Raped in UTe 
Parking Lot 
CRIME: Three men attacked the 
woman last Tuesday evening 
By Erik Johnson 
Staff Writer 

A 20-year-old female was abducted from 
her car and raped at the University Town 
Center (UTC) parking lot last Tuesday 
evening. The shopping center, frequented by 
many UCSD students, is located a few miles 
from campus. 

The crime occurred between 5 :30 and 6: 15 
p.m., according to the police report. The 
woman was waiting for a friend at the north 
side of the parking lot near Sears when three 
men in a faded blue sedan abducted her. They 
then drove her to another part of the parking 
lot where she was sexually assaulted for ap-
proximately 30 minutes. 

The assailants have been described as one 
African-American male about 40 years old 
and two Chicano men of indeterminate age. 

By Eric Schmidt, Senior Staff Writer . 

According to San Diego Police Lt. Glenn 
Britenstein, there were no witnesses, and po-
lice have little upon which to base their inves-
tigation other than the victim 's description of 
the attackers. 

UCSD

which could

brain 

eading Isaac Asimov's Robot Series, in which 
thinking androids populate the universe, got 
Michael Sailor thinking. Programming a com-
puter is straightforward enough, but duplicating 
the human brain with computer circuitry is a 
much tougher problem. 

Sailor, a UCSD assistant professor of chemis-
try, got an idea which could lead - eventually-
to robots that think like people. He decided to use 

an organic compound that grows randomly in three dimen-
sions, in a pattern that mimics the "dendritic," root-like 
growth of brain cells. 

"If you ever want to be able to make connections in 3-D 
[like the brain], you have to be able to enter all three 
dimensions," said Corrine Curtis, a graduate student who, 
with the help of undergraduate Jason Ritchie, worked on the 
project. 

Like brain cells, Sailor believes his strands of molecules 
could form numerous links to other strands in all directions 
and in three dimensions. In such an interconnected system, 
the computer circuitry would take the same form as a human

Britenstein added that this is the first time a 
sexual assault has been reported at UTC and 
that it does not appear to be part of a recurring 
problem. UTC security refused to comment on 
the incident. 

"We cannot underestimate the shock that 
something like this has on the individual," 
said Nancy Wahlig, di rector of Student Safety 
Awar~ness at UCSD. "It was early in the 
evening, in a public place, in a relatively safe 
neighborhood. Sexual assault can be com-
pletely random, and very much out of the 
control of the victim. 

"We want to know what we could have 
done, but whatever this woman did, she stayed 
alive," Wahlig added. "All anyone can do is 
trust their instincts and cooperate with the 
attackers until she can find a way out. 

Student Safety Awareness conducts self-
defense and rape workshops and can be reached 
at 534-5793 for rape counseling. 

Any witnesses to the attack on Tuesday 
night should contact the San Diego Police 
Department.

cording to Alva, the work force 
reductions will occur primarily

the govemor's budget, saying that 
it will continue the trend of pushing 
the cost of higher education out of 
the reach oflower-income students. 
Emerick was also skeptical of the 
Office of the President's pledge to 
contribute CIne-third of the fee hike 
revenue to flDancial aid. 

"Students are payinga 17 per-
cent increase and getting nothing 
in return except for more cuts at

"Once again, students are be-
ing asked to pay more to get leas, ..

trend." 

According to Emerick, the

the state Legislature to allocate 
more money to the university when 
it debates Wilson's proposal this 
summer. The UCSA wiD also fo-
cus on convincing the Office of

posed fee increase.

UC students weren't the only 
ones hit hard by the governor 's 
budget. Students in the California 
State University (CSU)systemwill 
likely be hit by a 24 percent in-
crease in fees, even though CSU 
schools received a 3.9 percent 
boost in state funding. Commu-
nity college fees will go up from 
$13 to $20 per unit, an increase of 
54 percent, under the Wilson plan. 

Wilson also proposed a $900 
million bond measure to finance 
construction of new university 
buildings. 

The proposal released on Friday 
containsa$3billiongap, which the 
governor hopes to fill with federal 
govemmentaid, a development that 
many observers feel is unlikely. If 
the aid falls through, Wilson said 
the state will face massive cuts 
throughout the budget.

allow users not only to watch 
"programs," but to interact with

The prototype of the informa-

complex data via phone lines 
through computer terminals. The 
Intemet, the "heart" of the 
highway, links some 30 million 
individuals. 
• Who wll u .. It? If fully 
developed, those with personal 
computers or "computerized" 
televisions will be able to access 
the information highway. Based on 
current costs of using services on 
the Intemet, initial costs will 
probably be high.

Coast confer-
ence 

in La Jolla last August, conservative pundit 
George Gilder spoke of an American future 
built on "sand and light." Sand, he said, i~ 
~i1icon chips, smaller, faster and cheaper than 
ever before. light is digital fiber opties, 
capable of handling millions, perhaps billions 
of bits of information per second. Put 
together, Gilder said, anyone can have the 
world at his fingertips. The individual will be 
empowered like never before. 

Gilder is not the most dynamic speaker in 
the world. He stumbles over words and often 
reads with a droning, monotone voice which, 
on any other ocasion, would probably put his 
audience to sleep. But the aowd is captivated. 
Gilder is talking about a not-so4istant future 
when, through the wonders of digital cellular 
technology, one will be able to punch up the 
morning paper, or send a fax, or make a 
phone call and actually s« the penon on the 
other end, all through a hand·heId computer

The audienoe is mesmerized. This is the 
much-touted "information superhighway," 
the wave of the future. If AI Gore hIS his 
way, every home in America will one day be 
tapped into the great electronic infrastructure. 
For better or for worse, the information 
superhighwayjs coming to a personal 
computer or television set near you. 

For better or worse because this highway 
is not a freeway, but a ton-road. Contrary to 
popular belief, information is neither free nor 
cheap. According to the Economist of 
London, infonnatioo ordiDarily available for 
free (or inexpensively) to the public on paper 
through alocallibnry or JOVClDIDeIll apocy 
commands a hefty price when obcaiDed

win likely decline drastically once an 
infunuation highway is in place, it seems 
likely that, like pbone service, information 
systems will always cany a nominal price. 

Corporations will playa large role in 
setting up the information highway. There is 
no getting around that. Cities, like UCSD 
Professor Emeritus Herb Schiller, worry that 
the information highway will "inevitably be

COMMENTARY: Despite 
all of the noise about the 
infonnation superhighway, 
it's still unclear whether 
people actually want it 
By Danl.I .Hattl. 
sr." Writer 

T alk continues to rage about the video revolution to come, the lCH:aIIed "information 
superhighway." 

Aaxm1in& to the multi-mcdia visionar·

Wen follts, despite all the rbetoric, 
I'm DOt hoIdilll my breath. It is 
questionable whether this highway of 
bype will actually lead anywhere. 

All of this hoopla bas been inspired 
by the recent mega-billion dollar 
mergers of cable and telephone 
companies (such as Bell Atlantic, TIme 
Warner, Viacom). At the root of this 
converaence of the cable and telephone 
indusaries are new digital compression

available, no one will be necessarily 
compelled to use them. In other words, 
there is nothing to suggest that the 
interactive highway will create any 
more "distracted and numbed

cessfully created already. They will 
just be distracted in a different way. 

In any event, mass-commercial-
ization and privatization should be the 
least of our worries. Whether the in-
formation highway is public or pri-
vate, the individual's privacy will be 
in greater jeopardy than ever before.

nary product testing

Continued from pa.- 4 

Bui the fact is, there are major 
obstacles to getting this information 
superhighway up and running. First, 
such a system win take far longer 
(probably decades) and cost far more 
thantbepubJicgenerailyrealizes.And 
second, there is the questionofwhether 
consumers would want or use, let 
alone be willing to pay for, these new 
futuristic services. 

A stagering hardware build-up 
will be necessary to set up the infor-
mation superhighway. As the Wall 
Street Journal documents, the cost of 
blanketing the nation with fiber-optic 

backbone of any future information 
highway: the Internet. Established 
with federal funds in 1969, the Net is 
an organization of about 12,000 com-
puter networks, serving nearly .3O 
million users worldwide. Any student 
can obtain a computer acoount at no 
charge from the university, giving 

himor~foelecllmicmail,games, 
~ and a litany of news ~ 
where a diversity of topics, ranging from 
sexual fetishes to pro wrestling to feminig 
legal thecxy, are dicicIsed. 

The Net is a fun, educational, ex-
citing place to roam. But, in 
cyberspace, everyone can hear you 
scream -or whisper. Though the Net 
affords the user a certain degree of 
anonymity, the user's personal files, 
includingelectronicmaiJ,are not simi-
larly protected. Once on-line, the pri-
vacy most people take for granted in 
the real world sudck:n1y disappears. 

cable and state-of-the-art digital equip-
ment will be the rough equivalent, in 
today's donars, of building the inter-
state highway system. It would cost at . 
least $100 billion, which is about equal 
to the combined current revenue of 
the cable and regional telephone in-
dustries. There's no way this is going 
to happen overnight. And even if it 
gets set up, anaIystsareSkeptical about 
the new services' ultimate profit p0-
tential. 
. The current plan is to pass much of 

this staggering cost to consumers 
through higher cable-lV rates. How 
the industry figures that we consum-
ers are going to be willing to pay 
upwards of $50-$100 a month for 
television is beyond me. After all, it 
was consumer fury of already high 
cable rates that inspired the (pitifully 

The UCSD Guardian 

When one \ogsonto UCSO'scom-
puter network, a disclaimer appears 
warning users that their "personal" 
files are subject to inspection by net-
work operators. Aware of this fact, I 
avoided sending electronic mail for 
nearly a year before convincing my-
self that Big Brother had better things 
to do than read my silly missives. But, 
even though I am content to use elec-
tronic mail often, I never write any-
thing which I would not otherwise 
mind saying in public. 

Certain popular commercial ser-
vices also have privacy waivers writ-
ten into their user contracts, allowing 
the service provider to closely moni-
tor their customer's comings and go-
ings and even allowing the service to 
dip into the user's personal electronic 
files at home. 

In an age where information is 
considered a commodity, it is not hard 

ineffective) 1992 Cable Act. 
This leads to my second point-

the question of whether there is even 
a market out there for this new infor-
mation superhighway. Viewers' 
voices have been lost in the hype. 

Corporate America 's multi-media 
visionaries seem to be naively con-
vinced that they need only to build, 
and the people will come. This is 
wishful thinking at best (after all, it's 
not like they're building a baseball 
field). 

Surveys show that consumers are 
basically satisfied with lV as they 
know it; their complaint with cable is 
not lack of choices or channels but 
high cost and program quality. 

But with the information super-
highway, consumers' cosrs would 
sItyroctet. Meanwhile, programquaJ-

to conceive of the hazards that could 
come with an the benefitsoftheinfor-
mation highway. Private information 
brokers who specialize in the gather-
ing and compiling of personal infor-
mation from public sources will be 
big winners when the highway is com-
pie ted and an estimated 100 million or 
more people are tinally on-line. 

What's more, when it comes to 
electronic privacy rights, the law is 
often not on the individual's side. The 
courts have held time and time again 
that employers have every right to 
peruse their employee's private files 
with impunity. Privacy advocates ar-
gue that since data is carried over 
telephone lines, the laws prohibiting 
phone tapping should be similarly 
applied to computer networks. So far, 
their efforts have been uns>Jccessful. 

In 1994, even without the benefit 
of Gore's information superhighway, 

ity on the plethora of available chan-
nelswould probably be poor. As cable 
industry insider John Sie notes, "It 
takesa lot of programming to fill a 24-
hour channel.... Even the cheapest 
video format - talk shows - costs 
about $20,0CX> an hour." 

As the audience fragments over a 
multitude of channels, narrow-inter-
est programming wouldn't be cost-
effective for advertisers. And that 
means that these channels just 
wouldn't have the budgets for the 
quality programming that consumers 
want. 

Meanwhile, it's important to point 
out that currently only 61 percent of 
the nation's homes with access to 
cable actually subscribe to it. How is 
the information superhighway going 
to hook up all of America if39 percent

virtually anything can be (and P~ 
ably is) done electronically. Pay a bdl, 
deposit and withdraw funds. Ourcredit 
records, our financial and criminal 
histories, our grades, all exist elec-

stop an enterprising or malicious indi-
vidual or group from stealing or ex-

p�oiting that information to our detri-
ment. If everything is electronic, and 
nothing electronic is private, then pri-
vacy as we know it is in grave danger. 

I think that George Gilder is right 
when he says that the individual stands 
to gain a great deal when the informa-
tion superhighway arrives. But until 
laws are changed and one ' 5 electronic

or don' t see the need for, simple cable 
television already? Even cable sub-
scribers still mostly watch the three 
major broadcast networks. 

Personally, I'm skeptical about 
viewers' demand for interactivity, one 
of the more hyped aspects of the infor-
mation superhighway. Viewers are 
expected to communicate with and 
program their televisions (via an elec-
tronic box like current cable boxes) to 
access the various services. And this 
is being demanded of a people that 
can't even program a VCR! 

Viewers may not even want to 
use interactivity. After a "hard day's 
work, "peoplejust want to plunk them-
selves down in front of the TV set and

INTERVIEW: Like radio and television technology, the infonnation superhighway is being appropriated by the private sector 

SCHIllER RIDES THE INFO-HIGHWAY 
Int.rvlew by Do~ AI.x.nder 
Opinion Editor 

"Do you think I'm ever invited on 
Nightline?" he asks rhetorically,look-
ing me in the eyes. No, I think to 
myself, I'm sure he isn't. 

Some intellectuals, he tells me,are 
not wanted by the mainstream press. 
Some intellectuals do not fit within 
the narrow spectrum of "acceptable" 
opinion. And there's a mountain of 
evidence, he continues, attesting to 
this exclusion. 

Herb Schiller has spent much of 
his life battling this, battling the real 
cultural elite, what he identifies 
as Corporate America. Thrown to the 
market, the mass media - like any 
other big business-propagate a very 
specific ideology, a "corporate alti-
tude," which often precludes other 
perspectives that do not "sell" or are in 
some way threatening to established 
norms. This creates a vacuum, politi-
cal and cultural, which deeply affects 
the character of our society, CUItUfl~­
indeed, our psychology - and which 
is ultimately detrimental to a func-
tional democracy. 

Enter the information highway. 
As the highway is being built. laying 
the foundations for what may become 
"the" new medi urn, Professor Schiller 
asks some very fundamental - and 
challenging - questions about how 
media is, and should be, organized. 
Against a background ofcheerleading, 
his voice is especially clear and his 
words especially profound.

The "information highway" is a 
construction of wishful thinking based 
on the actual capabilities of the new 
electronic technologies - a merging 
ofW. telephone and computers into 
a potentially comprehensive system 
through which a vast amount of im-
ages, messages and data will flow. 
Some have taken these potentials and 
turned it into a near-imminent struc-
ture. 

There is at the present time what 
might be regarded as a prototype, in 
embryonicforrn, that'scalled Internet. 
So, there is something out there, I 
don't mean to say this is all imagina-
tion. However. the idea oftbis becom-
ing a fully comprehensive, national, 
universal, revolutionary system with 
overall total access - that is some-
-thing which, at this point, is just ver-
biage. We have to know how some of 
these intentions and good wishes are 
going to work oul. And there we run 
into a very different kind of story.

Well, I wouldn't say this is untrue, 

but maybe it's a little overblown and 
premature. 'The idea that there is an 
increasing relianCe on, and utilization 
of, electronics for delivering informa-
tion is certainly accurate. However, 
whether this is going to make an over-
whelming change in the character of 
American life or simply an extension 
and deepening of what already exists, 
that's a very open issue. 

Gore makes it sound as if we're on 
the threshold of a vast transformation 
of our sOCial order. I would say, unless 
I had far more evidence and informa-
tion about what's going on, that the 
transformation wiD be only to deepen 
the character of what bas been hap-

sion-making process. At this point-
and I'm not sayingthatthisisn'tsome-
thing that cannot be opened up - the 
participants come from a very tiny 
stratum of the society, the corporate 
stratum of society. And they are work-
ing hand-in-glove with a handful of 
top government officials .... 

These real big decision-makers, 
the ones who have the clout based on 
economic resources, are the large-
scale companies centered around three 
major sectors of American life. One 
sector is the telephone sector, another 
sector is computer, a third sector is the 
cable industry, and I would add a 
fourtb sector, the entertainment-cul-
tural field. These are the four big 
private sectors which have been set-

two or three limited tests that have 
been done have shown mixed results. 

Ultimately, despite all the bype, we 
probably won't see the information

ting the pace, making the decisions ... 
eacb one trying to get the best ar-
rangement for their specific interests 
- and they'll fight for them. 

However, nobody, up until now, is 
fighting for the interests of the rest of 
us. Vice President Gore has made 
statements to that effect, they say they 
wantto have public interests protected 
and they say they want to have univer-
sal access. Those are good statements 
- I love those statements - but I 
want to see some real effort to imple-
ment them. 

The govem:nent has turned over, 
without any question whatsoever, the 
building of this SCH:aIIed electronic 
highway to these large-scale enter-
prises. The justification is that they 
have the money. And after they build 
it, they tell us, 'tho! we'll try to see 

that they handle it fairly.' I mean, that 
is the most patent, what can we say ... 
whitewash. that you could ever imag-
ine. Once you allow those who have 
the resources to form the structure and 
then you ask them to perform de-
cently, well, that doesn't cut much ice 
with me. 

This government has embraced 
the whole concept of deregulation of 
industry, deregulation of enterprise 
whicb bas a very important public 
quality . If you deregulate these things, 
this is another way of saying there is 
no social acoountability - and social 
aa:ountahility is what we need in this 
society more than anything else. We 
are all continuous1y overwhelmed with 
the notion that if we leave it to the 
market. everything will work out. 
Everything will work out like it's 
worked out over the last two centu-
rieS: Vast numbers of people will be 
caught in the roncrete mixer and the 
really big steam roller. That's how it 
usually "works out."

Very. very much so. 1bose are 
good analogies. Obviously this is a 
mucb more comprehensive technol-
ogy, obviously this technology goes 
far beyond the earlier forms. But the 
question is what kind of social struc-
ture are you going to embed in this 
new technology? In the case of radio, 
if you go back long enough, to the 
early days of radio, there was a real 
national debate on these questions-
something we don't have at this time. 
In the national debate we said. 'Maybe 
radio should be a publicly di~ected, 
publicly owned institution.' And there 
were some very powerful forcesargu-
ing that point. Although it didn't suc-
ceed. at least there was that kind of an 
outlook . . 

In the case of television, it went 
directl y into the hands of the same 
types who had come to control ra-
dio .... and that's exactly what's hap-
pened to cable. Cable is now in the 
hands of a balf-dozen of "multiple.-
systems owners" Telecommunica-
tions Inc. (TCI), for example, controls 
25 percent. One out of every four 
cable-viewing families in the country 
is under the jurisdiction ofTCI. 

So, that's what's happened to our 
technologies. They've all been appro-
priatedby these corporate entities and, 
over the years, they have become 
increasing! y concentrated so there are 
fewer and fewer of them .... Don't talk 
to me about the virtues of competition 
between three telephone companies 
and two cable companies, four cul-
tural conglomerates and maybe five 
computer companies. That's not com-
petition, that's the big boys dividing 
up the spoils. 

Sophisticates talk about 'Oh, well. 
business which is big is not necessar-
i1ybad.lt·s more efficient. 'But there's 
noproofevenofthat. Evenverysmall-
scale organizations are very efficient. 
But again, I'm not talking about the 
railroad industry, the airplane indus-
try, the cereal industry. I'm talking 
about the media industry and I don't 
know how anyone can claim that news 
structures with vast resources con-
trolled by a handful of groups is a 
healthy kind of condition for society.

Well. the most elementary kind of 
an alternative would be to build off 
wbat already exists. This' whole 
Intemet - which is now utilized by a . 
significantnwnberofpeople-started 
with governmental funds. Now, when 
they've got it organized, they want to 
tum it over to private enterprise -
that's been the story in America since 
time immemorial. 

But there's another way to go: 
Keep it the way itwasandexpand iton 
the same basis and make sure every-
body has a fair crack at it. But that 
seems to get lost when large-scale 
economic bozos are out there and 
have the ability to channel the public 
discussion. How does this thing get 
argued over the radio, over 1V in the 
news. when you read these articles? 

Theynevergiveanyseriousweigbt 
or even opportunity to express a view 
which, in contrast to turning this over 
to Bell Atlantic and TCI and Para-
mount Communications and 
Microsoft, says to tum it over to the 
American library Association, Par-
ents-Teachers Association. the AFL-
C10-you could name a dozen large-
scale public institutions. Many people 
might think this outlandish, but not 
everybody would think so and it's 
certainly a question which should be

Student Regent Visits UCSD Campus 
FORUM: Morrisroe 
criticizes university's 
long-term-fee policy 
By Gina Freschl 
Staff Writer 

Student Regent Darby 
Morrisroe called on concerned 
University of California students 
to be more effective advocates to 
the Board of Regents, stressing 
that 'he board can be an effective 
ally on student concerns. 

"There are a number of regents 
who want to support us. but they 
need reasons. They need backing. 
They need data to counteract in-
formation from the Office of the 
President," said Morrisroe, add-
ing that students should present 
the regents with as many facts as 
possible. 

Morrisroe's discussion of lob-
bying tactics was one of many 
topics addressed during a meeting 
with UCSD students on Friday. 
Morrisroe, who was on campus to 
attend this weekend's meeting of 
the University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA), also 
discussed the university'S long-
term fee policy, declining minor-
ity enrollment and her role as stu-
dent regent. 

At its meeting next week in Los 
Angeles. the Board of Regents will 
vote on a new long-term fee policy. 
The modelbeing considered by the 
board calls for the assessment of a 
uniformly charged educational fee. 
which would be determined by. the 
amount of money the university 
needs after the state budget alloca-
tion to the UC system. 

Morrisroe is particularly criti-
cal of this plan. which she said 
does not have widespread support 
among board members. "Essen-
tially, [the regents] are creating a 
fee to pay for anything they want. 
This is all they've been doing for 
the past five years," Morrisroe said. 

"[The proposal] licenses defi-
cit spending. The university can 
spend whatever it wants. and stu-
dents would have to pay the defi-
cit," she added. 

Danny Rusplnl/Guardlan 
Student Recent Darby Morrlsroe talks to UCSD stud.nts. 

The long-term fee policy would 
also create a separate registration 
fee for each campus to be deter-
mined by the individual chancel-
lors. Morrisroe criticized this facet 
of the plan because the chancel-
lors would not be held account-
able and would have no incentive 
to be restrictive in assessing the 
fee. 

"It opens th ... door for differen-
tial treatment [of the campuses], 
and once that door opens it never 
stops. It opens the door to that kind 
of in-fighting," said Morrisroe. She 
also faulted the policy for not ad-
dressing the issue of access to the 
university for low-income and 
minority students. 

"There is an increasing number 
of high school students who are 
eligible for UC, but who are not 
applying because of the perceived 
high cost." she said. According to 
Morrisroe, the university needs to 
make more of an effort in outreach 
programs. 

As the only student on the 26-
member board, Morrisroe said her 
power does not lie in her vote, but 
rather in her ability to effectively 
discuss and lobby issues. "Some 
listen to me as a peer while others 
see me solely as a student advo-
cate. I have, however, more re-
spect and influence than I thought 
I would," Morrisroe said. 

"Getting their respect is like 

walking a tight rope," she added 
with a laugh. 

Morrisroe would like to see 
changes in the regent selection 
process. "The appointments are 
primarily political patronage. We 
need a set of quality criteria for 
someone who sits on one of the 
most powerful educational bodies 
in the state," said Morrisroe, add-
ing that the solution is to create a 
broader pool of candidates . 

Morrisroe has a strong back-
ground in student affairs. having 
served as UC Davis' student lobby 
director and financial aid advo-
cate. She applied for the board 
position with the desire to repre-
sent student needs more clearly. 
"Students haven't been effective 
advocates. There were virtually 
none when I arrived on the board." 
she said. 

Morrisroe is currently com-
pleting her honors thesis at UC 
Davis. She devotes 50 hours a 
week to her board position, trav-
els nine days a month. works 15 
hours a week as an academic peer 
advisor and balances a full course 
load. She squeezes her indepen-
dent study in late at night or dur-
ing office hours. 

After she graduates, Morrisroe 
will apply for fellowships at the 
state and federal levels and begin 
to pursue a joint law and political 
science Ph.D. 

A.S. Freezes Student Organization Budgets 
By Philip Michaels 
News Editor 
• nd Jonna P.lm.r 
Associate News Editor 

In the wake of the State Su-
preme Court's Smith v. Regents 
decision. student organizations 
returned from winter break to find 
their budgets frozen while an As-
sociated Students committee de-
cides which organizations are eli-
gible for funding. 

The budget freeze affects all 
student organizations, with the 
exception of the A.S.-funded me-
dia, and is expected to last through 
the fourth week of Winter Quar-
ter, according to A.S. Vice Presi-
dent Finance Neena Malik. 

Last February, the state Su-
preme Court ruled that organiza-
tions which are political, reli~ious 
or ideological in nature could not 
be funded by mandatory student 
fees. After the U.S. Supreme Court 
upheld the decision in October. 
University of California student 
groups were ordered to comply 
with the new ruling, putting the 
funding of many student organi-
zations in jeopardy. 

In November. the A.S. final-
ized an interim fundin, procedure

for Winter Quarter. Underthe tem-
porary guidelines, a six-member 
committee of five college repre-
sentatives and one A.S. council 
member would vote on the eligi-
,)i1ity of organizations to receive ' 
funding, based upon guidelines 
provided by the UC Office of the 
President. 

Malik said that the Office of the 
President's definitions are very 
clear. "Everybody is pretty happy 
with the definitions, although even 
with stringent guidelines, it·s dif-
ficult to decide [which groups are 
political. religioua or ideoloai-

cal. ... Even things that are clear 
cut aT still difficult to decide," 
she added . 

At a special meeting tonight. 
members will be appointed to the 
Student Organization FundingEli-
gibility Board. On Tuesday, stu-
dent organizations will sign up for 
hearing times. The to-minute hear-
ings will begin on Wednesday and 
last approximately one week, said 
Malik, adding that in a best-case 
scenario the process would be com-
pleted within a few weeks. 

"The sooner the better. That 's 
everybody's main concern -
when will these [budgets] be un-
frozen, and when will student OT-
ganizations go back to doing what 
they do," Malik said. 

Regardless of how quickly the 
process takes. the budget freeze is 
certain to affect the way many 
organizations operate. The les-
bian, Gay and Bisexual Associa-
tion (LGBA), for example, usu-
ally depends on student funds for 
such events as Gay and Lesbian 
Awareness Week, scheduled for 
the end of January. This year. the 
LOBA will rely on fund-railers to 
pay for the event, according to

same manner that a person does. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Making the Connection 00:00 
Scientists at the Sailor Lab grow long chains of 
organic ·wires· from this electrolyte solution, . 
which contains slngle-molecule monomers. The 
monomers combine into polymers, which can be 
used to conduct electriCity. 

Monday, January 10, 1994 

00:30 10:00 30:00 

To illustrate the effectiveness 
of the brain over conventional 
computers, Sailor said people can 
recognize an image of the Sistine 
Chapel almost immediately, while 
a computer may· take several sec-
onds to sort through every image 
stored in its data bank. 

While computers are faster in 
the sense that they sort through the 
images more quickly, the brain's 
parallel structure, with cells highly 
interconnected, allows it to find 
the Sistine Chapel without sorting 
through every memory. Sailor 
hopes his technique can some day 
be used to duplicate the human 
thought process. 

At time zero, 
the two 
platinum wires 
are submerged 
In the solution 
and are not. yet 
coated with the 
conducting 
polymer. 

After 30 
seconds, the 
polymerization 
has occurred 
on only one 
wire. The 
current is then 
switched to the 
second wire. 
The polymer, 
while growing, 
is in the 
conducting 
form. 

Here, the 
polymer is 
growing at both 
electrodes. 
Dendrites 
appear and 
grow.off in 
random 
directions. 
While the 
second wire Is 
growing, the 
polymer on the 
other side Is in 
its insulating 
form. 

At some time 
( approximately 
30 minutes) 
two dendrites 
meet to form a 
connection -
an electrical 
shunt between 
the two 
platinum wires. 
At this point, 
the 
polymerization 
Is stopped. 

The reference electrode 
allows the system to define 
an absolute volatge 
between the electrodes. 

According to areport published 
in the Dec. 24 issue of Science, the 
researchers connected two strands 
of the three-dimensional, stalac-
tite-like compound by varying an 
electric current. When the current 
is alternated in a specific pattern, 
the strands are dirccted to link 
together. 

The counter electrode is a 
platinum flag shaped into a 
2-<:entimeter square. The 
electric current flows 
toward this electrode. L-_________ -' Source: Jason Ritchle/Sallor Lab 

While the compound and its ' 
pattern of growth were already 
known, no one had tried to link the 
strands before, Sailor said. 

Connecting the two strands, 
which can either conduct electric-
ity like wires or insulate against 
current flow, could lead to poten-
tial applications like a replicated 
human brain. Sailor emphasized, 
however, that "These things are 
not even close to thinking devices." 

According to Sailor, the silicon 

chips currently used in computers 
will fail to make good synthetic 
brain cells because they are lim-
ited in the number of dimensions 
and connections they can make. 
With silicon. "We're not going to 
be able to make anything more 
sophisticated than a slug brain," 
he said. Sailor's new method may 
be just the thing to surpass the 
limitations of silicon. 

Sailor's lab will not develop a 
computer brain, nor will lab mem-
bers try to apply their science to 
new inventions. "We're develop-
ing the chemical tools," which 
other groups can apply as they 
wish, Sailor said. 
No IIIIIn y.t 

Severa} problems still need to 
, 

be solved before the new tech-
nique could be used in a neural 
network. First, better insulation 
techniques need to be developed. 

If there are multiple connec-
tions between strands, the strands 
must be insulated from each other 
or they will short-circuit "We have 
to make the wires, and then we 
have tc· SMink-wrap them," Sailor 
said. 

The Sailor group first tried 
physically dipping the connection 
in an insulating mixture, but the 
scientists didn't want the extra step. 

To get the strands to connect 
and become insulated without 
moving them into a different pot 
of chemicals, the group developed 
a technique to insulate the strands

method is not perfect, so Curtis 
said she is looking into better insu-

In addition, the new technique

the researchers perfect the proper-

must only conduct electric current

Regents Respond to A.S. Criticism 
LEnERI: Council, 
regents debate hospital 
pay increase 

By~""'" TIIIeMn 
St." Writer 

Following the University of 
California Board of Regents' No-
vember decision to increase the 
salaries of hospital administrators 
by an average of 21 percent, the 
Associated Students wrote letters 
to each of the regents, voicing its 
concern over the matter. 

At the November meeting of 
the board, the regents voted 13-5 
to subsidize the pay hikes for top 
hospital administrators with hos-
pital revenue. 

Two different letters, both dated 
Nov. 24, were sent to the regents 
who voted in favor of the pay hike 
and those who voted against it. 
llIe letter sent to the regents against 
the pay increase thanked them for 
their "vote that reflects concern 
for the future of the public educa-
tion, and the ability of the UC 
system to maintain the standard of 
excellence it is known for." 

The other letter was sent to 
those regents - and UC President 
Jack Peltason - who voted for the 
pay increase, lambasting them for 
their "blatant disregard for the 
well-being of the university, and 
education as a whole." 

. The letter also spoke of the 
«ASUCSD and the student 
population's outrage with the 
regent's decision to increase the 
salaries of hospital administra-
tors by 21 percent over the next 
year." 

The letters were signed by A.S. 
President Carla Tesak, Vice Presi-
dent of External Affairs Nick 
Endres and the A.S. Local lobby-
ing Director Naomi Falk.

--Lubbe levin, 
UC Assistant VIce President 

As of last Friday, three re-
sponses had returned to the A.S. 
from Regents William Bagley and 
Roy Shults, and UC Assistant Vice 
President Lubbe Levin on behalf 
of Peltason. 

Each of the letters said the im-
minent need for the UC medical 
system to compete in a business-
like fashion against other institu-
tions of the private health-care 
sector, in what has become an ex-
tremely competitive market. 

The A.S. received a copy of a 
letter sent to Regent Glenn 
Campbell from Shults that de-
scribed how the "[UC] medica1 
centers have been thrust into- an 
economic battle typical of corpo-
rate America," but at the same 
time have to overcome the pres-

sure applied by other competitors 
that "are not obliged to teach, to do 
research or to carry anything close 
to the charity caseload demanded 
of the university's teaching hospi-
tals and faculty." 

Shults added that "we cannot 
afford to permit our academic 
medical centers to mis-step now 
when time is critical, risk losing 
key people vital to their economic 
viability and conceivably slide into 
mediocrity far more rapidly than 
any of us can conceive." 

Levin also agreed with Shults' 
view on the need for the UC medi-
cal system to operate competitively 
in a fierce market. 

"Our academic medical cen-
ters must succeed as businesses if 
they hope to continue succeeding 
as the superb teaching and research 
institutions that they are .... They 
must attract extraordinarily com-
petent administrators to run them 
as efficiently, as effectively and as 
entrepreneurially as possible," 
Levin wrote. 

A briefletter written by Bagley, 
underlined the Board of Regents' 
belief in the importance of "pay-
ing market price for business ser-
vices." 

Bagley criticized the A.S., add-
ing that "students of your capabil-
ity should know and understand 
the above. Even if you disagree, 
please at least to acknowledge that 
facts to the contrary may exist." 

Falk said that she was upset by 
Bagley's letter, calling it a per-
sonal attack. 

"I've always maintained some 
small amount of hope that the re-
gents are always screwing us, but 
that they're unconscious of what 
they've been doing and just 
weren't in touch with issues. But 
[the letter] kind of blew that for 
me," Falk said. 

UCSA Amends Charter at UCSD Meeting 
By JOIIIIII Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

After a long weekend of meet-
ings and conferences at the Price 
Center, the University of Califor-
ni • . S!u{leJllli J\SSOs:iation (UCSA). 
selected the final three candidates 
for next year's student regent. 

The UCSA did not release the 
names of the three finalists before 
press time. The student regent for 
1994-95 will be selected by the 
Board of Regents at its meeting in 
Los Angeles later this month. 

The UCSA also amended its 
charter in an effort to shift from 
being primarily a lobbying body 
in Sacramento to a role as a stu-
dent voice before the UC Regents. 
The shift came as a result of the 

Smith v. Regents decision in which 
the state Supreme Court ruled that 
political, religious or ideological 
organizations cannot be funded by 
mandatory student fees. 

."We ch,anaed a l1umbel of . 
amendments... to conform to 
Smith," said Associated Students 
Vice President External Nick 
Endres. "We're changing our fo-
cus from representing students at 
the legislature to representing stu-
dent interest in front of the re-
gents. [Because of the Smith v. 
Regents decision], if students want 
a voice in Sacramento, they're 
going to need to raise the money 
themselves," 

Endres added that the shift in 
directIon may be a very positive

thing for the students "because in 
the last few years, [the UCSA has] 
put more of a focus on the legis-
lature." 

According to Endres, the presi-
~nt of the university.has a great 
deal of influence over the regents, 
but many regents may be ready to 
vote against him with more sup-
port. 

"It may be a good thing for 
us ... to start lobbying the regents. 
A lotof regents are just looking for 
an opportunity to challenge the 
president," Endres said. 

Endres also voiced his confi-
dence in the creation of another 
student lobbying group that will 
target the state legislature some-
time in the near future .

strands across the broken link. 

In essence, this would elimi· 
nate mechanical repairs on small 
circuits. However, Sailor noted that 
silicon chips are currently so cheap 
that they are usually thrown away 
and replaced instead of repaired. 

Another possible application of 
the technique is the creation of 
tiny "micromachines." "Right 
n9w, we have no tools to make 
little machines the size of bugs," 
Sailor said. 

According to Sailor, silicon can 
be used to make tiny fans and 
pulleys, and his method could be 
used to connect circuitry for the 
machines without using tiny tools. 
Such technology is still very primi-
tive, however, and the creation of 
tiny machines seems to still be in 
the arena of science fiction.

The Sailor lab has found inspi-

FREEZE: 
Board will review 
organization status 
Continued from pe,. 7 
LGBA Principal Member Alex 
Gamer. "If we don't [raise enough 
money], it'll be really scaled 
down," Gamer said. "It won't be 
the same caliber as it has been in 
the past." 

The budget freeze did not come 
as a surprise to many student orga-
nizations. Malik said she had kept 
in touch with the organizations 

since the beginning of Fall Quar-
ter and warned them of the freeze 
before Winter Break. She con-
ceded, however, that the move 
probably shocked some students. 

"I don't think anybody ever 
thought it was going to come to 
this, even us .... We didn't think 
we were going to have to act this 
quickly," Malik said. 

Gamer said that he wasn't sur-
prised by the freeze. "I'm not too 
surprised anymore at what the univer-
sity does, unfortunately," he added. 

According to Malik, the A.S. 
will not only have to deliberate 

DAMN You 

The UCSD Guardian 

which organizations will receive 
money in the future, but also how 
much money to refund for past 
events. Students can apply for a 
refund of fees that went to political, 
religious or ideological activities 
during the past four to five years, 
but the refund would only amount 
to four or five cents, Malik said. 

" I don ' t know how many stu-
dents would take the time to come 
up and fill out a form to get a check 
back for four cents," Malik added. 
Nevertheless, $7,000 of unallocated 
funds have been set aside for re-
funds.

Pepperdine Ices Tritons 
'CE HOCKEY: Unbeaten Waves stick UCSD with 8-210ss at San Diego Sports Arena 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Guardian Reporter 

Exciting collegiate ice hockey 
action fi lied 
the San Diego 
Sports Arena 
late Saturday 
night as a 
struggling 
UCSD squad 
battled the 
visiting 
Pepperdine 
Waves. 

The surg-
ing Waves 
seized control 

ofthe game early on and never relin-

quished it, rolling to an 8-2 win over 
San Diego. With the loss, UCSD's 
record fell to 1-3-1 on the season. 

Pepperdine, which is also a mem-
ber of the Pacific Collegiate Hockey 
Association, came into the game 
unbeaten on the season, and the Tri-
tons knew they had a tough battle on 
their hands. 

"The team looked flat coming 
off vacation," Head Coach Gary 
Andreassi said. The Tritops lack of 
practice time since returning from 
the break proved too much to over-
come against Pepperdine. 

The Waves' offensive charge was 
powered by Corey Undlin and Sean 
McGillivray, who combined for six 

of the Waves' eight goals and four 
assists. 

For UCSD, defensemen Don 
Hayes and Erik R'anheim netted the 
two San Diego goals, with Joe Zaki 
assisting on both scores. UCSD was 
hampered by penalties throughout, 
racking up 22 minutes in the penalty 
box, which left the team short-
handed for the most of the contest. 

The Tritons now look ahead to 
their next matchup against league-
rival Stanford, which will take on 
UCSD at the Sports Arena at 10 
p.m. on Friday, Jan. 21. The game 
will take place at the conclusion of 
the San Diego Gulls contest, and 
admission is free . 

Archers Long For Shooters 
The newly-formed and woefully 

incomplete UCSD archery team is 
in search of recurve and compound 
shooters to complete this year's 
team. 

Women and men of all experi-
ence levels are welcome to com-
pete. Activities of the team include 
participating in collegiate archery 
activities and shooting in local tour-
naments. 

The UCSD archery team has ac-
cess to a brand-new shooting range 
constructed by the university, which 
is long enough to permit 9O-meter 
competitions. 

The archery team and club meets 
every Saturday morning at 9 a.m. on 
the UCSD archery range, located 
behind Thornton Hospital. Most 
meetings consist of some club busi-

ne~, butthe bulkoflhe time is spent

By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Capturing three national cham-
pionships in 
the last four 
years couldn't 
have hurt the 
Tritons' posi-
tioning in the 
first NCAA 
women's wa-
ter polo pre-
season poll, 
which last 
week seeded 
the San Diego 
squad top-dog 

going into the 1994 season. 
Last year's title holder, UC Davis, 

was ranked second. Slippery Rock 
(AR), UC Santa Barbara and UC 
Berkeley round out the polls top-
five . 

The Triton lady contingent will 
begin holding tryouts for this year's 
team today, Tuesday and Thursday

All eligible UCSD women stu-
dents who can swi m are encouraged

"We are always looking for 
people," Head Coach Denny Harper 
said. "Everyone who can swim is 
welcome to come out. It's a blasl."

vantage to 46-28 at the half. • 

"I think the subs were tbe key to 
this game," Head Coach Judy 
Malone said. "They gave our start-
ers a [much needed] rest." 

ThC Tritons came out firing in 
the second balf, snuffing any 
Bearcat attempt for a comeback. 

At 17:05. UCSDowned a 56-35 
lead and never looked back. The 
Tritons maiqJained .. h.althy 20-
point advantage through the remain-
der of the game, cruising home for 
the 81-63 final tally win. 

Yamasaki tallied 15 points and 
only four turnovers against 
McKendree's pressure defense. 

Saturday afternoon, Arkansas' 
Harding University paid a visit to 
UCSD's Triton Pavilion. 

The Lady Bisons quickly 
jumped on the tired Tritons, build-
inganearlyleadofI7-8. ButUCSD 
battled back behind a strong post 
pedormance by Sarah Schneider, 
who nailed 10 of her 13 points in 
the first half. 

San Diego pulled as close as 25-
22 in the first half, but was unable 
to catch the Lady Bisons. 

Beaver was a bright spot inside 
for UCSD, scoring the Tritons'last 
six points of the half, but it was 

Harding tbat finished strongest, end-
ing the half with a five-point run to 
establisb a 43-36 lead going into the 
locker room. 

However, with the second half 
underway, the Tritons' recent de-
manding schedule finally took its 
toll on the fatigued squad, which 
couldn't withstand Harding's swift 
attack. 

A relentless barrage of excellent 
perimeter shooting and bruising in-
side play led Harding on a quick 10-
2 run, giving the visitors a 53-38 lead 
midway through the second half. 

Hardings' Bridget Benson scored 
a game-high 26 points, and forward 
Kymm Alexander's strong low-post 
play led to a 20-point performance. 

"We had a letdown, " Malone said. 
"We've played six games in 12 days 
against tough competition and it 
showed." 

Despite Beaver's second consecu-
tive 20-point outing, UCSD was un-
able to muster a comeback. 

The Lady Bisons continued to 
press their advantage, strs:tching tbeir 
lead to as many as 21 late in tbe 
second half. At game's end, Harding 
settled for a 76-60 triumph. 

"Harding was a real good team," 
Malone said. "I think we were just 
tired from so many tough games."

Perhaps the most surprising vic-

UCSD again looked flat in the first

Men's Volleyball 
Opens Season 
WAVY START: Fifth-ranked Pepperdine proves too 
powerful for San Diego in Triton season opener 

The Triton men's volleyball team 
ki cked off its 1994 eason Saturday 
~ 1t Peppcrdine, falling in straight sets, 

15-1, 15-5, 15-11 , to the nation 's 
fifth-ranked team. 

Under the direction of San 
Diego's own six-time Division III 
women's volleyball national cham-
pion Head Coach Doug Dannevik, 
the UCSD men are having to adapt 
to new playing styles and a new 
courtside general. 

Playing against the nation 's best 
week in and week out in a 
divisionlcss arena, the Tritons are 
expected to do more with far fewer 
resources, but Dannevik was "noth-

SECURITY: 
athletes in danger 
Continued from page 20 
just like the rest of us. When Mitch 
Williams gave up that fateful home 
run to Joe Carterin the World Series 
last ye3r, he received death threats . 
He was rightfully given a police 
escort as he left the Skydome and 
retrcated to his ranch in Texas dur-
ing the off-season, out of genuine 
fear for his life in Philadelphia. 

Celebrities like Madonna are fa-
,...mous for having an entourage of 

bodyguards to offset these threats. 

ing but positive" with the Tritons' 
performance against Pepperdine. 

"We sided out really well in the 
first game, but couldn't score," 
Dannevik said. "It took a while for 
us to get loose. We were all a bit 
anxious. By the third game, we were 
much more aggressive and started 
to pick up the blocking and defense." 

Tom Black led the Triton attack, 
recordingseven kills and seven digs, 
and setter Geoff Givens dished out 
17 assists. 

"Our guys really kept at it," 
Dannevik said. " The goal of that 
game was to sce when; we were." 

-By Brian K. Hutto 

If security were tighter at the tour-
ney where Sele; was stabbed or the 
arena where Kerrigan was beaten, 
we wouldn't have to see their an-
guished faces on the front page of 
every newspaper in the country . 

Sports could go on, business as 
usual, and the future of tennis and 
ice skating could be settled on the 
court or ice by the athletes, not by 
some crazy people. Give sports fig-
ures the attention they need and in-
crease the security at athletic events 
so this won't happen again. 

Once was enough, twice is 
unexcusable. Athletes and fans alike 
deserve better.

Continued from pa,e 20 
yard backstroke. 

The UCSD men were equally 
dominating. Kaley Parkinson bad a 
landmark day, achieving personal 
bests in two races. His 22.69 pace in 
the 50-yard freestyle topped the 
field, and he garnered second in the 
1 DO-yard freestyle (48.58). 

Travis Miller won two events, 
cruising to a 1 :58.88 in the 200-yard 
1M and 4:52.25 in the 500-yard 
freestyle. 

Chris Jagard notched first place 
with a 1 :49.13 in the 200-yard 

freestyle, and Justin Kitagawa wasa 
formidable presence in tbe 2OO-yard 
fly, finishing second (2:04.47). 

Jeff Kudo led UCSD to a 1-2-3-
4 sweep in tbe 200-yard breast 
(2:13.27). 

In the UC Irvine Invitational div-
ing competition on Saturda.y, tbe 
women's performance reflected 
their status as a favorite to win Na-
tionals. They cleaned up in both the 
one-meter and three-meter events. 

UCSD seized the first three spots 
in the one-meter, led by Joanna 
Frazier, who scored an insurmount-
able 248, good for the top spot. 

Jill Jackson and Kristi Young 
finished second and third, respec-
tively, to round out the sweep. 

Jackson (279.08), Julie Goldstein 
(261.98) and Sheri Takeuchi 
(259.13) all notched NCAA Divi-
sion III Championship qualifying 
scores in the tbree-meter event, in-
creasing the number of Triton 
women qualifiers to four. Young 
qualified at a previous meet. 

Adam Burgassertook the top spot 
for the men witb a 248.19 mark. 
Second place belonged to Josh 
Curtis, who tumed in a solid 212.18. 
Sebastian Holsclaw made bis pres-
ence known as well, recording a 
211.50. 

"The guys are coming around," 
Head Diving Coach Mike Fitcbette 
said. "They defmitely are stronger 
this year than tbey were last year."

BLAIR 

JOHnSOn 
Skater's Attack 
Inexcuseable Tritons Capture La Jolla ClasSIC 

Last Thursday night, Nancy 
Kerrigan became the second 
prominent female athlete to 
become a victim of a random 
act of violence. As she was 
leaving the ice after a practice 
session for the U.S. Olympic 
Trials in Detroit, she was 
beaten with a blunt instrument 
behind her right knee. The 
assai lant fled the scene and has 
not been apprehended. 

Witne se claimed the 
attacker had pres credentials, 
which would have given him 

./ access to the re tricted area and 
Kerrigan. 

A scant nine months ago, 
we were shocked by a similar 
tory of a crazed Steffi Graf 

fan stabbing Monica Seles at a 
tennis tournament in Germany. 

After a tragic yeal in sports 
which showed u that athletes 
are every bi t as mortal as the 
common person, 1994 should 
be a fresh tart from the 
negative headlines. Whi le 
putting the Seles incident 
behind us - along wi th the 
untimely deaths of basketball 
l_ ~ stars Reggie Lewis and Drazen 

Petrovic and baseball pitchers 
Steve Olin and Tim Crews-
we should greet the new year 
with open arms. 

After all , there is growing 
excitement for U.S. hopes in 
the Winter Olympics next 
month in Norway, the NBA 
season is now wide-open with 
the departure of Michael 
Jordan and baseball promises 
to sport a new look this year 
after realignment. 

But how can we be asked to 

By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Head Coach Tom Marshall paced 
the floor of the Triton basketball 

court late Sat-
urday night. 
His host 
UCSD men's 
basketball 
team trailed 
Southern 
California 
College, 59-
49, with less 
than 10 min-
utes to play in 
the La Jolla 
Classic. 

Was the 
coach, who had gu ided the Tritons 
past Division III third-seed Millikin 
University the night before, wor-
ried? Not a stitch. 

"We' re a team that has to play 
with focus and intensity all the time 
if we want to win," Marshall said. 
"We were not as focused as we 
hould have been going into this 

game [against SCC] . Once we fi-
nall y settled down and concentrated, 
[ knew we would be OK." 

To be sure, the Tritons (11-3) 
everely underestimated their north-

ern foe, SCc. The Vanguards (9-6) 
had just barely managed to get by an 
unimpressive Claremont College (4-
6) in Friday 's match up, 75-66, and 
SCC's leading scorer, Eric Price, 
injured his knee early in the first 
half of the championship contest. In 
reality, the Vanguards had no busi-
ness stealing UCSD's limelight. 

Nevertheless, SCC burst out of 
the blocks nailing a flurry of three-
pointers and showcasing an ex-
tremely miserly defense. Only seven 
minutes into the game, the Van-

guards fielded a comfortable 19-8 
advantage, and thoughts of an upset 
swirled through the air. 

The UCSD offense couldn't 

throw a pea into the ocean. The 
Tritons produced a subpar 12-37 
first-half shooting performance. 

San Diego's usual "can't miss" 

senior three-point specialist Erik 
Johnson was colder than the Arctic 
tundra from the perimeter. To add to 
UCSD's problems, overachieving 
SCC controUed the boards in the 
early going. 

Finally, senior point guard 
Rodney Lusain sparked a small run, 
dishing out scoring baskets to both 
Khalil Allen and Johnson down low, 
cutting the Vanguard lead to 24-17. 

SCC refused to yield, increasing 
the defensive pressure and canning 
52 percent of its shots in the first 
half. Every time the Tritons threat-
ened to jump back into the hunt, 
Southern Cal's Court Bickmore 
would nail a wide-open three or poi nt 
guard Danin Bryant would slice and 
dice his way to the hole. 

Yet with Allen's relentless re-
bounding effort and Lusain's keen 
passing ability, UCSD managed to 
limp into the locker room at the half 
down by only six, 40-34. 

Stunned, the Tritons looked little 
better in the opening minutes of the 
second half. Then, trailing 49-43, 
Lusain gave beleaguered UCSD a 
wake-up call, drilling back-to-back 
three pointers from the far-left cor-
ner. At last, things started to pick up. 

SCC made a late surge, but the 
spell was broken. Down by seven, 
Nate Hantgin, Uisain and defensive 
demon Johnson sent the Tritons on a 
tear with less than four minutes left. 

San Diego's defense denied ev-
erything SCC could muster while 
Johnson 's fast-break dish to a slash-
ing Hantgin to make the score 67-66 
brought the Triton crowd to its feet. 

Johnson's own jump-stop finish 
of a Lusain fast-break pass put UCSD 
up for good, 70-68. 

UCSD's amazing come-from-
See HOOPS, Page 15 -t maintain a positive outlook 

when promising young skaters 
like Kerrigan are whacked on 
the leg with a ti re iron? To 
avoid similar si tuations in the 
futu re, athletes should be 
accorded higher security.

"I'm really happy with how 
things are shaping up," UCSD Head 
Coach Doug Boyd said. "We're right 
on schedule." 

It looked promising on the 
women's side from the outset as 
UCSDconquered two Emory teams 
in the 4OO-yard medley relay. 

Freshman Renee Salgado was 
untouchable in both the I,OOO-yard 
and the 500-yard freestyle events. 
Her lightning-quick II :04.59 in the 
1,000 was good for first place, just 
ahead of teammate Diane Wegienka, 

(11 :06.71). Salgado later recorded a 
5 :24.19 in the 500, also good enough 
for first place. 

Sterling performances were com-
monplace for the Tritons. Freshman 
Heather McPherson won the 200-
yard freestyle, clocking a 2:00.60. 
She also won the l00-yard freestyle 
with a time of 56.24 . 

Another freshman, Michelle 
Berger, snagged first place in the 
200-yard intermediate medley 
(2:17.22). Enjoying a good day, she 
also captured a second in the 200-

GUARDIAN ATHLETE-OF-THE-WEEK 

Point guard Rodney Lusain led the Triton men's basketball 
team to victory in the La Jolla Classic Tournament this weekend 
with his MVP performance . 

He tallied 18 points and six assists against Millikin University 
of Illinois and scored eight points while dishing out eight assists 
in the championship game against Southern California College . 

"[Lusain] controlled the action and got the ball to the right 
people," Head Coach Tom Marshall said. 

"[Lusain] is one of the best point guards I've ever seen," 
Millikin 's Head Coacb Joe Ramsey praised.
