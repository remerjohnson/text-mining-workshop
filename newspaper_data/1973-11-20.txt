Progress With 
Your Pilgrim 

By Gob Blur, Ph.D ., Creative Cuisine 

How should one cook their Thanksgiving 
pitgrim? It has long been debated whether 
your Puritan Pullet should be broiled, 
baked, fried, barbequed, of even stewed in 
liquor . Some even say that the tradition of 
man at Thanksgiving is outdated, and that 
they prefer a pig to a man any day. Such 
skepticism aside, the problem of the best 
manner in which to prepare a man is a 
serious subject. 

Here are some helpful hints on how to 
make this Thanksgiving's special a rare avis 
indeed . Never use a de-boned pilgrim, as a 
spineless man is apt to wilt under heat.

Carefully pluck all of the hair off of your 
young Goodies and Deacons. If you are 
pressed for time b cause you want to watch 
the clawball games on TV, merely ba~te 
your homo sapien liberally in ' Nair M ake 
sure that your puritan is complet with 
neck, as necks make the finest giblet gravy. 
Trim excess lard off of your butterball , as 
men are known for their abundant fat . That, 
by the way, is a major reason we do not 
cook the head. 

Although most men come pre-stuffed, if 
yours does not you may stuff it according to 
your ethnic taste . For example, Irishturkeys 
may stuff with potatoes and beer, 
Italiturkeys with Mozzerella cheese , 
Mexiturkeys with frijoles, and Angloturkeys 
with Pilgrim-Helper. 

Cook until golden brown, serve with 
candied corn , chinaberry stew, and of 
course, Pil grim Pie. Use your imagination !

McElroy Challenged on Town Center 
by Chris Rauber 

A new dimension was 
added to the Town Center 
controversy Friday, when 
an unexpected challenge to 
Chancellor McElroy's 
position on the issue was 
voiced by J.R. Fromen, an 
employee of the University. 

McElroy's position, and 
therefore the position of the 
University, is one of 
conditional support for the 
proposed multifunctional 
center. 

Mr. Fromen says that 
many faculty members and 
employees don't agree with 
McElroy, "but a lotof them 
are hesitant to say 
anything ." He wasn 't 
hesitant, however, claiming 
that "Chancellor McElroy 
isn't speaking for me." 

He spoke to the Triton 
Times on his lunch break, in 
a Mayer Hall machine shop. 
He charged that "in the past 
the employee hasn't had 
too much recognition," and 
hasn't been asked for his 
opinion, and that 
"Chancellor McElroy isn't 
speaking for the whole 
University . I don't recollect 
a poll being taken about 
this issue among students 
and employees." 

" Meetings may have 
been held on campus by the 
Chancellor and other in-
terested groups ," he 
continued," but an em-
ployee can't take time off 
work to attend meetings." 

" I feel that the University 
should take a poll or hold 
an election to determine 
whether the Town Center 

should be built, especially 
after learning that there 
may be apartments and 
highrise buildings built on 
the site ." 

He urged that such a poll 
be taken before the con-
tinuance meeting of the San 
Diego City Council is held 
on the 6th of' Feb~uary to 
decide the issue. 

Feeling, as he did, that he 
was a member of a group 
(University employees) that 
is usually taken-for-granted 
and ignored, he seemed 
eager to have his opinions 
heard. The comments 
continued to pour out : 

"Do we need that amount 
of square footage and 
11,000 parking. spaces in 
this areaL .We should be 
cutting down on building 
asphalt jungles and parking 

lots ." 
"Developers in others of 

San Diego, especially in 
Mira Mesa and Tierra Santa, 
have not complied with 
their promises . The 
developers behind the 
Holiday Inn (on La Jolla 
Village Drive) haven' t 
complied with original 
plans to provide parks and 
other recreation areas ." 

"Since when is a big 
developer going to listen to 
the University-they haven't 
in the pastl Once the bull-
dozer blades are in the 
ground , anything can 
happen." 

Besides voicing these 
environmental concerns 
and h is fears that promises 
made by developers would 
not be honored, Fromen 
speculated on future im-

Conservationists Defeat Landtec 
by Rick Drom 

It appears that CAlPIRG and the Sierra Club have 
won their long standing battle over the development of 
the Kemp Ranch. land T ec, a large land corporation, 
will not be able to develop the land and it will probably 
be bought by the county instead. 

The Kemp Ranch, located in the laguna Mountains, 
has been the subject of an intense debate for almost a 
year now. Environmentalists have opposed the 
development ever since the landTec corporation an-
nounced its intentions to build private condominium 
campsites in the 1,500 acres of wilderness. 

Objections to the development of the site centere<.l 
on the lack of water in the area and the loss of open 
space . Other objections included the increased air 
pollution which would damage near-by ubservatories 
and the increased auto congestion in the area. 

landTec was granted approval by all of the 
preliminary boards and agencies last Spring. The only 
hurdle to development was the San Diego Board of 
Supervisors. CAlPIRG (California Public Interest 
Research Group), the Sierra Club, the offices of Jack 
Walsh and Senator John Tunney made their last stand 
here. 

CALPIRG served as a coordinator for these 
organizations to stop the LandTec plan. It also 
organized support among the community to show the 
Supervisors' how the public felt about open spaces. 

The first critical meeting to decide the fate of the 
Kemp Ranch was scheduled for May 2. About 200, anti-
landTec citizens showed up and jammed into the 
hearing room with Igns and banners. Later the 
SUpervisors commented that this mass show of support 
had been impressive. 

"If the public had not turned out that day in such 
large numbers; it wouldhaveallbeen over," according to 
Dan Franklin, director of CAlPIRG. "Their sheer 
numbers did mlOch to influence the final decision." 

Due to the response, the hearings were postponed 
again and again in an effort to reach a compromise 
regarding the use of the Kemp Ranch. Throughout these 
hearings Howard Wiggins, the Sierra Club attorney, and 
Byron Lindsley Jr.,an environmentalist, worked hard to 
show the Supervisors the dangers inherent in the 
landTec plan for development. 

last Spring it appeared that Jack Walsh, the chairman 
of the Board of Supervisors, was the strongest opponent 
of the landTec development. He seemed to be working 
with Senator Tunney's offiLe in an effort to pass 
legislation in Congress to buy the land. 

But during the summer other Supervisors seemed to 
swing to his side. 

A break-through occured this Fall when Supervisor 
lou Conde suggested that Revenue Sharing Money be 
used to buy the ranch for the county as open space. 
There was much debate over the proper use of Revenue 
Sharing money and some opponenets of the landTec 
development wished to see the money spent in other 
ways. 

But recently, after the Kemp's lowered their asking 
price from 2.3 to 1.75 million dollars, agreement 
seemed to be reached The Supervisors, with Walsh 
absent, voted unanimously to consider buying the 
property. 

Franklin said that, "CALIRG is pi a ed that it was able 
to help bring about the preservation of the Kemp Ranch . 
But unfortunatelywe can not be optomistic about th 
future of open space.in general in the San Diego area." 

"A new open space planning elem nt has re-drawn 
policy maps to exempt private land from op n pac 
consideration. If this new plan is adopted on De emb r 
12th, the future of San Diego's wildern s would b . 
critically affected," he said. 

"The K mp Ranch was a mall vi tory for open pa e, 
but the larger battle has not yet been fought," Franklin 
aid . 

plication . of the proposed 
Town Center. 

If extensive development 
in this area forces the 
Miramar Naval Air Station 
to move (it is presently 
open space), because of 
complaints about noise, 
will the developers move 
in? "Are the developers 
trying to force Miramar 
N .A .S. to move," he 
wondered? "Boy-oh-boy, 
would they like to get a 
hold of that property." 

" If Pete Wils-on is 
building up downtown, why 
build superduper shopping 
centers on the outskirts of 
town? Fromen asked. " It's 

time to consider limiting 
building in the San Diego 
area, because if we don't 
we'll eventually end up like 
l.A." 

Fromen seems to think its 
bad enough already. "Just 
drive acrQSS Miramar 
Road," he advised, " Iook at 
all the j unky factories 
within spittin' distance of 
the sidewalk." 

J.R. Fromen seems to 
have had it with both the 
developers and the U.C S.D . 
Administration . He's been 
with Scripps and the 
University for 14 years and

Student Lobby News 
by 'Rich Pool 

Over the past month, the Student lobby ha con-
cerned itself with the UC budget, UC investment 
policies, and bills in the state government affecting 
students. 

The budget represents the un iversity's immediate 
needs and wants and the lobby considers it their mo t 
important area of work. To make up for a lack of student 
input of budget reque ts at the university level , th 
lobby works at the administration and government 
levels. The lobby focuses attention on changes in the 
budget that would improve the education provided to 
students. The lobby is the only way many legislator 
It!arn of student view and they have come to dep nd 
on the lobby to provide this information. 

In the past, UC has given all its votes as a stockhold r 
in many corporations to the management. In several 

ases this policy has supported managements that have 
allegedly practiced discriminatory hiring or damaged 
the environment. The lobby has urg d the Regent to 
choose a policy that will consider the social impact of 
their votes . 

The State legislature has been acting on many bill 
concerning students. Some of them, along with the 
Student Lobby position are;

The Success 
of Change 

The American idea of 
success is changing, ac-
cordi ng to a 52-page report 
recently published by 
American Management 
Associations, the world's 
largest not-for profit 
management education 
institution . The report, by 
29 year old business writer, 
Dale Tarnow ieski, con-
c ludes that " the suc-
cess idea that is'emerging as 
values shift may exalt above 

richness of human ex-
perience and the rewards 
inherent in a socia l reality 
in which genuine op-
portunities for self-
expression are nearly 
limitless."

Maharishi U. on 
Education 

The well attended 
presentation give n by 
faculty of the Maharishi 
International University 
Friday night, November 16, 
was, to say the least, both 
thrilling and inspiring. 

Video tapes were shown 
at the beginning of the 
meeting which presented 
both the purposes and 
present activities of M .I.U . 
at Santa Barbara. The tapes 
consisted of speeches and 
comments by various 
members of the M .I.U. staff 
and students now enrolled 
at the university. Designed 
to both educate and 
enlighten those attending 
the presentation to M .I.U ., 
the tapes gave an indepth 
view of the foundations of 
transcendental meditation 
and the science of Creative 
Intell igence. 

In addition to the tapes, 
the fdculty had brought 
exhibits, which revealed 
concrete scie nt i f ic 
evidence as to the 
beneficial effects for those 
who exercise tran -
scendental meditation. 

In the discussion with the 
faculty of M .I.U . which 
followed the video tape 
presentaiton, it was an-
nounced that a M .I.U . now 
established in San Diego 
will begin its winter quarter 
on January 7, 1974. Those 
interested in taking courses 
on either a full time or part 
time basis at M IU. should 
register b tween lanuary 2-
4, at the San Diego World 
Plan Center. Tuition p r 
quarter at M .I.U . is $450. At 
present there are

on-campus housing in 
Ca li fornia is in San t a 
Barbara . The university is 
however making plans for 
housing its San Diego 
students in the near future . 

The explicit picture of 
M .I.U ., its origins, goals, 
and basis as presented 
Friday night involved so 
much information that 
perhaps this picture ca n 
only become clear if one 
examines the description of 
M .I.U . given in a recent 
bulletin printed on the

Once it turned into an 
argument, yelling as well as 
the promulgat ion of 
vulgari m s w e r e 
predominat e . House of· 
ficers , Res id ent co un ci l 
officers as well as Cleo 
Malone (Resident 0 an) 
were found to b engaging 
in this perv reactivity 
throughout not only on this 
o ne subject but through the 
entire night. Interruptio n of 
a speaker was not un-
commo n, even by the 
temporary chairp rso n who 
did so ju t for personal 
c larifi cation . The chair-
person had littl control, if 
any, over the meeting . She 
had so little ontrol that 
motions were made , 
econded, and not voted 

upon; votes were con· 
ducted to decide if the 
council would vote and 
things of this nature. It was 
obviou that the chair-
person a well as the 
council wa unorganized, 
and lacked cooperation and 
consideration . 

At last som one came up 
with the ab urd idea to vote 
on thi se urlty m a ure . 
And absurd it was, for the 
presidents who were 
elected by their houses to 

repr sent th m, to present 
th ir id as, sp ak for them, 
refused to vot Some of the 
pr idents refused to a ept 
any responsibility for voting 
on this meas ure. Th y 
wanted to make sure that 
they w r in agre m nt 
with their house (Thi s is a 
good precaution , but why 
not do It for all measures?) 
The fa t is that many of the

How respon ible then are 
thes officers? One can 
eriously doubt the integrity 

of any officer who was 
unsure of himself or herself. 
But back to th point 
When the voting actua ll y 
got around Into being, two 
things happened (1) A 
fema le co-preS ident refused 
to vote pro, can, or even 
abstain! (2) Halfway 
through the voting Cleo 
made a motion to table the 
resolution until the next 
m ting -- and right there in 
the middle of voting - IT 
PASSED ! This is clear and 
concise eviden ce that the 
MUIR COLLEGE RESIDENT 
COUNCIL IS SCREWED UP! 

Cleo's positiveness can 
also be doubted when 
during the discussion of the 
5 & Dime he blurted out 
that Muir ~tLldents as a 
whole don't care about 
anyone, or anything but

Crippler On The Roof 
I feel that the 'rul ' which I had never 

heard of, ascending to the roofs of 
residence halls in particular, is somewhat 
debatable. Thi 'rule ' do s not appear in 
the " Residence Hall Handbook ," for one 
thing. I am taking it for granted that the 
rules in the pamphlet are the ones " to 
remember". Also the rul e about su n-
bathing on the ledges needs some 
comment . 

Rule #9 In the schedule of classes fo r 
Winter Quarter states and I quote, 
"Violation of rules governing resi dence 
In University-owned or -controlled 
property." 

These are not the o nly reasons why the 
"rul e" is questionable. It is my opinion 
that if a person i so physically able to 
perch upon a I dge or roof, he or she, as 
the case may be, will also be just a 
physically able not to fall off of said 
ledges and roofs . I have found recently 
that placing my bod on top of Beagle hall 
is frowned upon the RA. I will not 
mention his name at this time becau e 
the RA I not the issue. 

The roof IS a "quI te grea t" place to 
stargaze Recently we have had somE' 
action in the sky With Sky·lab and that 
new comet, " incredible" As well as 
various other phenomenon The 
unobstructed platform provides a clear 
view of the heavens as they say Also It 
may make a nice place to catch ome 
rays . 

Pushing omeone off or thru ting on ' 
own bod over the edge IS a stupid move, 
and I hope that no one at Revelle IS so 
stupid as to do such acts 

The rule concerning ledges refers to 
sunbathing alon , what about r ading? 
Steppin g out on the I dge IS al 0 a 
demanding task . 

Getting out on the ledge or roof would 
take desir6 and if one has that deSire and 
abi li ty, why not let heor shedo his or her 
thing today, tonight or for ever?

A welcome change of pace on Revelle 
Plaza was found last Monday as the plaza 
found itself host to a travelling group of 
thesbians known as the LAMB'S PLAYERS. 

They presented a modernized morality 
play, a bastardized version of the original 
Everym an, enti tl ed The Hound of 
Everyman . 

The two performances on the plaza were 
well received by all, and they managed to 
spread their Chr i tian message easily and 
good-naturedly, unlike Ho lY Hubert's 

photo: Smith 

brand of evangelism that the plaza hosted 
a few weeks earlier. 

Their performance was good spirited, 
campy humour, with some energetic and 
rapid paced performance. Their travelling 
stage and spirit is a welcome return to the 
aura of street theatre . 

The Lamb's Players have been together 
and performin g Everyman for three years 
now. They just recently began performing 
full -time. Th ey will be preparing a new 
piece for presentation this spring,

Editor's Notes 

The music of the "Quintet" represe ted a tota lly unique 
interpretation of American "swing". Reinhardt and Grappelly 
were imaginative spontaneous so loists who often made 
otherwise lifeless arrangements dance and somber ones cry 
Grappelly's play exhibit d an almost mystical, spritely nature as 
he moved melodically through an arrangement. Guitarist 
Reinhardt wou ld maintain and d ve lop the thematic material 
by quickly embe llishing and enhancing each successive idea. 
Like all great jazz artists, no arrangement was played in the 
same' way twice. 

The material on Django '35-'39 is made up of standards of the 
day. Included are fine take on "I Got Rhythm", "Limehouse 
Blues" , "St. Louis Blues" and "It Don't Mean a Thing [If it Ain't 
Got That Swing]". 

Django '35-'39 is a "must" record for past fans who want a 
clean, quality reissue, and suggested for those interested 
who've not yet heard this guitarist, th is team, thi s part of our 
jazz heritage. I particularly recommend this album for listeners 
who simply like to hear the " great" guitarists. While the rrusic of 
the "Quintet" may be dated in style its technique is quite 
" tr'meless"

A few weeks ago I reviewed the Z.Z. Top album entitled 
Tres Hombres. At that time I remarked how they had 
"generated a mystique about their live performances" and I 
called the album "the best power trio rock album since the 
early Cream efforts". 

Well , Saturday night November 10th, Z.Z. Top appeared at 
the revamped Palace now known as J.J.'s. 

I had called their album comparabl e to Cream's best, but live 
they are better than Cream, much better . 

The trio plays as a "unit" , each complementing one another 
more so than I thought possible from three rock musicians. 
They're quite remarkable. And finally an American rock 
guitarist (Billy Gibbons) with the "class", dynamism and 
technique of Britain 's be t. After three years of tour ing steadil y 
their sense of showmanship has been fi ne-honed and it rea ll y

note to last. Th re wa never a quest io n of, " am I haVing a good

Next time in San Diego they'll be second-billed at the Arena

A free concert wa held Friday night, November 9th, at the 
" Back Door" (San Diego State Uni versity) fo llowing the last 
m inute cancellation of expected headl iner Danny O'Keefe. The 
show featured fine country-i nspired vocal ist/pianist Ro nee 
Blakley and the Asylum Records artist, newcomer Ned Doheny 
M . Blakl y sings with a beautiful tonal purity like that of Joni 
Mi tchell . Her writing, consistently very good, exhibits a frai l 
quiet tension between voice-lyric-melody. ed Doheny is a 
singer, songwriter and guitarist with considerabl e potential. On 
thi s night hi s performan ce was marred by techn ical (acoust ic) 
diffi cultle but he nonetheless impressed me as a name to 
watch.

Women's Volleyball 

League Title Held 
For the third year in a 

row, the UCSO Women 's 
Volleyball Team took their 
league crown . But all this 
was forgotten this weekend 
as the girls ventured into 
the SDWI B Tournament 
and 10 t to Mesa College, 
who took third in the 
league. 

Playing well below their 
capabilities, the Tritons 10 t 
two straight matches to the 
M e a girl two sets to one. 

The girls started la t 
Wednesday by sou ndly 
beating the second place 
Grossmont 15-7, 15-4. This 
year the gi rl s have had 
trouble with this team, as 
they lost one match to them 
earl ier in the season . 

This time around, the 
girls had no problems as the 
combination of con istancy 
and better overall play 
swept them easily past this 
usually tough team . 

Ironically, Grossmont 
also lost to Mesa College, 
whom they had beaten 
twice during season play, 
but were forced to play 
without their best setter, 

who sprai ned her back in 
the game . 

UCSO a l so was o ne 
player short, as the Triton's 
leading spiker Ti na 
Flammer was forced out of 
the competition with a 
badly sprained ankle. 

The circumstances were 
not the best for either team, 
as after the fi rst match with 
Mesa, the tournament was 
forced to look for new 
facilities becau se the 
Palomar ba5ketball team 
took over the Palomar gym 
for their pra ti ce . N w 
facilities were finally found 
at the Oceanside 
Recreationa l Gym, but were 
of poor quality. The net was 
too low and the court was 
too long and badly lit, but 
both teams suffered the 
same disadvantages . 

I n these circumstances, 
both teams played bad, but 
Mesa pulled out this match 
also two sets to one as the 
UCSD team did not seem to 
be able to return to its usual 
consistancy and play.

Police Cancel Game 
If any people wandered 

out to the field for the high 
noon showdown between 
the Revelle RA's and the 
Campus Police, they would 
have noticed that the field 
was very empty, except for 
some football players, and 
an occasional soccer 

Police, for reasons not 
disclosed to the Triton 
Times. Cou ld it ·be that the 
Campus Police are afraid of 
another defeat at the hands 
of the students, such as the 
one they lost to the Muir 
HA's, 17- 10, at the 
beginning of the quarter. 

'History in Making by Kirk Robinson 

Officials Educated 
" History is in the making 

at UCSO" says Bob Moss in 
reference to h is class, " The 
Psychology of Officiating." 
Moss says that the class is 
the only one of its kind in 
the U .S. as far as he knows . 

What is so unique about 
the class? The class itself is 
oriented towards teaching 
the students to become 
referees, umpires or any 
other type of official. But 
according to Moss this is 
only " the means by whi ch 
to achieve an end ." 

The end to which Mos 
refers is a positive attitude 
toward on s elf and toward 
life in general. To talk to 
one of the members of 
Moss' c lass reveals the real 
positive attitude that Moss 
is able to pass on to his 
students. 

Frank Gomez said that 
his involvem nt in the cia s 
has been a good experience 
and he says that it has 
enabled him to " co ntrol any 
situation, whether on the 
field or off. 

spring when Moss and his 
c lass umpir d all the home 
baseball games. 

Last summer th e group 
took over umpire duties in 
both the Pepsi High School 
League and the Home 
games for the La Mesa team 
in the California Collegiate 
League (a league made up 
of players from schools like 
USC, the NCAA champs, 
and Irvine, the NCAA small 
college champions). 

This winter the class y,ill 
be involved in refereeing 
several re reationa l 
Basketball league for the 
San Diego Rec reat ion 
o partment as well as 
working High s hool, and 
college scrimages . 

Nex't spring and summer 
the member of the cia s 
will take on various youth 
league umpiring tasks as 
well as umpiring the home 
varsity baseball ganles here 
at UCSD. 

One of the major in· 
centives in the program for 
the students is money For 
umpiring a baseball game a 
student can make as much 
as $15 . This may get people 
into the program , but as Jim 
Uebbing, now a member of 
the San Diego Officials 
Association, puts it "The big 
th ing now is the challenge 
that is involved in every 
game." 

........... -. .... player. 
This is due to the can-

We hope that this game 
will be rescheduled for 
another time, so that the 
students can once again 
prove their superiority. We 
also hope that this game 
will take place so that the 
TT sports page will be able 
to get a story and more 
pictures with which to fill 
otherwise empty pages . 

As far as the actual i n-
struction in offiCiating is 
concerned Moss dwells 
mainly on Basketball and 
Baseball, but some of the 
students have branched out 
and have become officials 
in such diverse sports as 
wrestling, swimming and 
volleyball as well as being 
an integral part of the 
refereeing corps for the 
Intramural program at 
UCSD. 

The program it elf began 
last fall with a group of 
seven students. These 
students began by of-
ficiating the varsity 
basketball scrimages and 
then went on to ref in the 
Intramural Basketball 
program . 

"The Psychology of 
Officiating" is an ongoing 
and growing program at 
UCSD. If you would like to 
get involved and earn a 
little money the side come 
on by th gym on the fir t 
day of classes next quarter 
and sign up for the class. As 
Coach Moss says "capture 
all the elephant and fret 
not the ants ." Th is is one 
elephant you shouldn't 
miss . Right Mark?

remained intact with all 
co uncil members when 
they all left an unadjourned 
meeting. 

Regardless, this author 
would like to offer the 
following suggestions to all 
Resident Council members : 
I nitiate some kind of order 
at meetings ; consideration 
for one another could be 
exercised by the members; 
a Parlimentarian could be 
appointed to aid in proper 
procedure, which would 
also establish a less time 
consumi ng and more ef-
ficie nt meeting; and 
ed ucate students in areas 
that are benE:ficial to them 
instead of passing the buck 
along to someone else via a 
resolution or measure . 

Paul Osterman III 

Wholly 
Potpourri! 

Editor, Triton Times : 
In reply to the man who 

was working towards a day 
when the different races 
and genres could resolve 
their co nfli cts . I have 
pondered this problem of 
differences and I must 
unfortunately say my 
co nclusion is not the 
happiest . Total equality is a 
physical impossibility as 
long as there are physical 
differences. i.e . race, sex, 
etc. since equality would 
mean the absence of 
conflicting status . Status is 
determined by ones ability 
to perform socially 
desirable roles i.e. ability to 
perform sexually, 
ath letically, intellectually. 
Different races are indeed 
better at certain of these 
roles than other. races since 
race is by definition a 
difference in physiological 
characteristics . People will 
only frustrate themselves 

the unolild .. 

trying to change these 
differences. I probably 
sound rather pontifical but I 
feel qualified since I am a 
Tri-racial hermaphrodite . 
Yes , my mother was 
Chinese-Indian and my 
father was Black-Irish . This 

-racial blend is the optimum 
for strength and in-
telligence as my size 0'8", 
280 Ibs and I.Q. of 190 wi II 
attest. Perhaps one day the 
rest of the world will have 
cross-bred to the extent 
where all wi II have such 
mental and physical 
c haracteristics, but will 
they be sexually equal? 
Obviously as long as men 
are men and women are 
women they will have 
sexual conflicts . The only 
resolution of these dif-
ferences lies in a hybrid as 
myself . A hermaphrodite is 
never sexually frustrated . A 
quadrophonic system such 
as mine is as enjoyable for 
one partner as it is for six. 
One particularly gratified 
partner (I bel ieve a woman) 
remarked that her ex-
perience with my multi-
ta l<. .. ted appendages 
reminded her of five 
aroused boa constri ctors.

Reply To 
Taylor 

Replying to the fine-
attitude article by John 
Taylor in the Nov. 2 73 
Triton Times : The 
motivation is laudatory, but 
other things ' should be 
considered . Trick-or -
treating is vicious in many 
ways unknown to the little 
dears who knock on the 
doors of the homes where 
they create misery, for one 
or many reasons . 
Discourage it! 

Many times it is unfair to 
expect donors to shell out $ 
for goodies that the 
children don't need , when 
the $ should, or could go, 

Over 200 Grlnnlngbird fl ights every day connecting North-
em and Southern CallfO~ Give yo.Y.r:. .campus rep or 
PSA a bird whietle . PIA ,... .... 

instead, to a charity where 
it is needed desperately, or 
even can be used in the 
very home hounded by 
trick/ treaters. 

Many times somebody is 
sick, or weary, just too beat 
to answer the incessant 
knocking of children who 
really have no right to 
disturb others for un-
necessary c rap , or for 
anything selfish . It's 
maddening , and wrong! 

Many times parents or 
sitters go batty, trying to get 
infants and young children 
to sleep , to be defeated 
repeatedly by the door-
knocking, bell -ringing, of 
kid) who don 't need the 
slop they beg . It 's 
frustrati ng and ulcer-prone l 

If you rea lly want to do 
someth i ng nice, as 
suggested in the well 
written article, volunteer to 
help in the children's ward 
at a hospital , or call a 
church or synagogue and 
vo lunteer to help an 
overworked parent with 
offspring . DON' T FEEL 
SORRY FOR YOURSELF 
BECAUSE . YOUR 
DIMINISHING PRIVACY IS 
RESPECTEO . BE GLAD! 
Maybe some parents 
assume that University 
students are busy studyi ng, 
and have the right not to be 
disturbed! Why not. in-
deed?

As he sees it, the 
Un iversity's employees are 
intrical parts of that 
community and should not 
be ignored. He wants to see 
an end to the present

the Administration . He
