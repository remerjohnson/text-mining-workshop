Good news, bad 
news, a New Year 

By ROGER SIMON 
Los Angeles Times Syndicate 

I know it has been a tough 
year for you. I know things 
cou ld have been a lot better. 

And I know around this time 
of year you look for some good 
news in your newspaper. I 
know it 's awfully hard to find 
that sometimes. 

I never have thought that we 
reporters had a "responsi-
bility' to fill our pages with 
good news. Our responsibility 
is to tell you how thi ngs really 
are, not how we wish them to 
be. If there was good news to 
report, that was fine. 1f there 
wasn't, well, that's the way 
things were. 

But today, I'll go looking for 
some good news. And I'll do it 
because it's out there. It isju t 
not always easy to see. 

The good news this year is 
you. 

There were a lot of bad 
stories this year. There was a 
lot of tragedy, a lot of 
suffering, a lot of death, I 
ended liP wnting about some 
of It. 

And every time I did, I found 
out the same thing: People 
care. They do. Even when they 
have no reason to. people care. 

Stones about tragedy are 
called "sabbers" In the news 
bUSiness and t here are enough 
sobbers out there to fill a 
newspaper from fronl page to 
last. 

The readers read them day 
after day. month after month, 
year after year. There is no 
shortage of stories about 
runaway daughters and dying 
sons and families living in 
cardboard shacks. There is no 
'ihortage of storie of people 
with terrible presents and 
uncertain futures. There is no 
shortage of s tones about 
people whose dreams have 
been plundered by reality. 

If anyone has a right to be 
bored, jaded and just plam sick 
of !-.uch stories. you do. 

And that IS why I am a lways 
surpri ed to find that you still 
care about people in trouble. 
And it doesn't even have to be 
big trouble. 

I once wrote about a 
waitress named Betty, who 
had worked all her life to buy a 
car. A few days after she was 
finally able to buy one, it was 
stolen. It was no big deal. Betty 
wa!:> nothing special, I wrote. It 

wa~ just too bad, that's all. 
There were certainly greater 
tragedIes 10 the world. 

But people wrote letters and 
made offers of help for day~ 
and weeks. Everyone wanted 
to help Betty.Just because she 
wasn't anybody special. 

The peol1te ""ith the least 
offered the most. It happens 
every time. The phone ca lls 
come tn and they go like this: 
"I don't have much money, but 
I'd ure ltke to help." 

This lime of year is 
e pecially tough on people, 
even tho e well-off. I think 
that's becuase there is 0 
much pressure to be happy and 
joyful. There is so much 
pressure to examine one's life 
and compare it to pa t years. 

And when people do that, 
they get depressed because 
they think they should be 
healthier, richer, better. There 
is so much pressure to be 
joyful. a ll I hey can think about 
is how much more joyful they 
should be. 

Not long ago, a woman 
called me. Her son, 19, had 
been shot to death . He wasn't 
anybody famous. He wasn't 
anybody special except to her. 
His death didn't even make the 
papers. he said Ihat when a 
famous person is shot, the 
world weeps. She wanted to 
know who would weep for her 
son. 

A lot of letters came in for 
this woman. A religious order 
in New Jersey IS going to say 
perpetual prayers in her son's 
memory. A woman named 
Eleanor Leigh in Dearborn, 
Mich., sent $2 and the hope 
that the woman's son would 
rest in peace. 

A very special letter was 
written by Shari Milan of 
Chicago. It's worth sharing: 

"Please don't think nobody 
cares. There is always 
someone who does. Even if it's 
jU'it a moment or two of 
sympathy 

"I do. r don't know you and f 
never knew your son. [ really 
don't know why I'm writing 
this letter. I'm just 18 years old 
and I can't say I've 
experienced life, but I have 
tasted quite a few bitter frUIts 
in the short time I have been 
living. Maybe the bad does 
outnumber the good, but you 
can't let it sour you on 
everyone. 

"I began to find myself 
becoming very bitter about 
life, so I decided to try a new 
approach. If I see a person that 
appears angry, hurt, or upset, I 
s mile at them , and !-.ay 
something nice or humorous 
and 95 percen t of the time I get 
a posi tive reSp0nse. 

" At th is time of year 
everyone is in a bad mood , '0 
my approach definitely has its 
advantages. I guess a 11 I'm 
trying to say is please don't be 
bitter. Someone cares." 

It wou ld be easy to make fun 
of that letter. It would be easy 
to call it nai ve or just plain 
silly. But somehow . this 
doesn't seem like the day for it. 

r can't promise you things 
Wi ll get better in the new year. 
I can t guarantee there wi ll be 
good news. But, as t he above 
letter s hows, there is at least 
one person who cares about 
you. 

What t he heck - make it 
two.

Letters to the Editor 

Will someone please listen to me? 
Editor: 

I'm going to try this one 
more time. I have been 
attempting to keep abreast of 
the articles, letters, and 
information printed by The 
Guardian concerning Reg 
Fees. In this process, I have 
seen some obvious errors, a 
number of misconceptions and 
a general lack of knowledge as 
to what Reg Fee funds are, 
where they are spent and who 
controls these monies. 

Several people have written 
concerned about possible cuts 
in the Intercollegiate 
Athletics' budget. I'm not 
really sure how t his idea came 
into being, but it i completely 
unfounded. There are no plans 
to cul the Intercollegiate 
Athletic budget. We are 
considering an increase as you 
by now are well aware. 

There was an article in Thl' 
Guardiall that !:>tated that we 
approved a temporary 
allocation to the Women's 
Resource Center. ThIS request 
wa ' in fact not approved. This 
same article abo stated that 

Thanks 
George! 
Editor: 

I wonder if you could help 
me say thank you to a student, 
probably in the computer 
classes there. The only name 
we know is "George." 

On Sunday, Dec. 12, our 
handicapped son went down to 
Black's Beach and got caught 
In the high tide. He was forced 
to spend the night there, cold 
and wet. Monday morning, 
George came along and helped 
Don out over t he rock , gave 
him water and shared what 
food he had with him. He then 
called the life guards, who 
ca lled the IXllice, and about 
2:30 p.m., we had Don back 
home, safe and well. 

So ... I would like to put a 
note in your paper: To George. 
. . who helped our handicapped 
son off the rocks at Black's 
Beach Monday morning, a 
heartfelt thanks, and God 
bless you. . .you probably 
saved his life! 
The Claud Wharton family 

If t here is a charge for this I 
will be glad to pay .. .r just 
think that with all the bad 
news we hear, a person who 
goes out of his way to help 
another should be thanked. 

Be tty Wharton 

the committee had plans to 
build a Career Planning and 
Placement bulding as well as 
Step-3 of the Student Center. 
Neither of these building plans 
have been approved by the 
committee. They are, 
however, being considered. 

Many people (at least [ get 
the impression that many 
people) see Reg Fees as the 
entire $399.50 that they pay 
each quarter. In actuality. this 
fee is split up into many pieces. 
one of which is the Reg Fee 
that has been so much in the 
public eye. The Reg Fee is 
$170.00 of that $399.50 and 
that is the money that the Reg 
Fee Committee concerns itself 
with. The remainder is spltt 
up (if I remember correctly 
between Ed Fees, Activitv 
Fees and the Student Cente'r 
Fee. 

I've recei\ed letters which 
voiced the opinion of seeing 
their money go toward 
important 'itudent services 
ral her t han toward research 
or funding the EECS dept or 
Physics dept. Well. I've some 
good news for these people. 

Reg Fee does nol pay for 
academic services. The Fee is 
to su bsidize tudent services 
and nothing else. Reg Fee 
subsidizes all or part of the 
Health Center, Legal Services, 
Off·Campus Jlousing, Campus 
Rec reation (i ncluding the 
Mission Bay Aquatics Center), 
Student Financial Services, 
Counseling and Psych 
Services etc. (a complete list 
can be found at the end of thi.:; 
letter). 

I think by now most people 
know who has control of thi s 
money but I'll reslate it 
anyhow. Vice Chancellor 
Joseph Watson from Under-
graduate Affairs has t he fina l 
decision on how this monev is 
spt:nL. Howeverbrecommelida. 
tlOns are made y the Reg Fee 
Advi so ry Committeee, a 
s tu dent·cha ir ed, student 
majority committee. Every 
student is represented on this 
committee either through the 
A.S. or graduate rep, or 
through the college cou ncil 
rep". The fact that this 
committee has a student chair

$1.8 tnillion aquatic center

~egents. The Regents have 
had man y years of expenence, 
and are fully aware trlat the 
s tudent ~egent has had very 
little time to learn the subtle 
arts of negotiation and sk illful 
debating. 

an enrolled student of the 
Universltv of California . He is 
fir~t screened by a st udent 
Regent nominating commis-
sion. made up of SBPC -
appointed students from the 
nine UC campuses , w ho 
recommend fi ve student s from 
the northern campuses and 
four s tud e nt s from th e 
southern ca mpu ses. Th e 
SBPe intervi ews th ese 
candidates and submit s one to 
a Special Committee, which 
deliberates, and upon 
acceptance, recommends the 
candidate to the Board of 
Regents for appointment. 

Constuctlon of the Olympic· 
size pool at the University of 
California, San Diego is on 
schedule with the badly 
needed pool and auxiliary 
facilities in the student 
recreation project scheduled 
for next spring. 

Groundbreaking cere· 
monies for the $1.8 million 
aquatics center were held last 
June on a five-acre site off Old 
Miramar Road east of Pryatel 
Field . The weather during the 
intial stage of construction -
grading and digging of the 
swimming pool - has been 
ideal allowing the work to 
proceed on t he original 
construction schedule. 

The recreation complex will 
include, in addition to the 50. 
meter swimming pool , a 10,500 
sq uare·foot recreation 
building hou si ng four 
raquetball / handball courts, 
pectator seating for the pool, 

an outdoor whirlpool bath, 
'heltered spaces for small-
group gatherings, and men's 
and women's locker facilities . 

The facilities will supple-
ment the single swimming 
pool current ly in use at UCSD 
whicn is inadequete to meet 
the recreation and athletic 
needs of the 12.500 tudent 
body. The cost of construction 
the complex is being funded by 
non- tate funds . co ming 
imtially through a loan from a 
commercial lending insitution. 
The cost will eventually be 
repaid by pre ent and future 
{,CSD student who will pay 
$12 per quarter ($36 per 

academic year) for the 
development for the next 30 
years. LlCSD tudents 
approved this means of 
funding in a referendum in the 
spring of 1981. 

Dunbar said a econd fund 
raising effort by the 
association will be aimed at 
the future construction of an 
additional 50-meter pool 
designed as a diving, water 
polo and training tank. The 
aquatics center complex was 
designed by Sillman/ Wyman 
& A ociates, of San Diego. 
Harper Development Co., of 
San Diego is general 
cont ractor for t he project. 

Additional funds for the 
complex are currently being 
sought by the San Diego 
Aquatics Assoc iation , a 
community a ociation 
repre enting all San Diego 
wimming interests which 

was formed to help develop the 
UCSD facility into an Olympic 
standard training s ite. 

According to David 
Dumbar, a UCSD alumnus 
and pre ident of the San Diego 
Aquati cs Association, the 
associa tion has already raised 
$140.000 towards a $200,000 
goal through a major corporate 
gift, pm'ate foundations and 
individual donors. 

"At present, there is no 
public 50· meter pool in an 
Diego and many of the area's 
talented swimmers are forced 
to leave the area to find 
national cali ber programs." 
Dunbar said. "The UC D 
aquat ics center represents a 

once-in-a-lifetime opportunit y 
by providing an Olympic 
standard training facility for 
San Diego's swimmers . 
Community u e of the facility 
will be as ured when our 
$200,000 goal is reached," he 
said . The student Regent mus t be 

Dr. Wayne Cornelius 
chosen to run LASA 

Dr. Wayne A. Cornelius, 
professor of political science 
and director of the Center for 
US·Mexican Studies at UCSD 
has been elected vice president 
for 1983-84 and president for 
1984-85 of the Latin American 
Studies Association of the 
United States (LASA). 

Cornelius is the first faculty 
member from the University 
of California to head the 16· 
year-old association, which is 
the principal organization of 
scholars in the Western 
Hemisphere who specialize in 
Latin American studies. LASA 
repre se nt s over 2,500 
individual scholars in all 
disciplines and 125 ins titu · 
tion having programs related 
to Lat in America . 

In 1979, Cornelius was 
elected to a three-year term as 
a member of LA A'sexecutive 
council. He ha al'o served as 
treasurer of LA A and as 
program director for the joint 
nat ional meetIng of LASA and 
the African tudies Associa· 
tion held In Houston in 1977. 
Also in that year. he received 

LASA's Citation for Disting· 
ui s hed Scholarly Conlribu· . 
tions. 

Cornelius is a nationally 
recognized authority on 
Mexican immigration and has 
a lso published extensively on 
the Mexican political system. 
He was professor of poli tical 
science at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology for 
eight years prior to joining the 
faculty at UCSD. 

He founded UCSO's 
interdisciplinary Cenler for 
US-Mexican Studies in 1980. 
The Center has since become 
t he nat ion 's largest program of 
research, training and public 
se rvice devoted exclusivelv to 
Mexico and US-Mexican 
relations. Cornelius has also 
served as cha irman of the 
executive committee of the 
nine·campus UC Consortium 
on Mexico and the United 
States (UC MEXUS) and as 
editor of the " Int ernational 
In ventory of Current Mexico· 
Related Research," which is 
published by the consortium . 

The SBPe's role is to 
continually strive to improve 
the quality of the UC system. 
Chu explained that ex officio 
status should aid the student 
Regent in being more effective 
in giving student s represnta· 
tion in Regent meetings. Ex 
officio status sets a preceden t 
for greater student Regent 
awareness in student affairs.

On patrol: a profile of the Guardian Angels 

By DINA SIMONE TEMPLE· 
RASTON 

In times of trou ble everyone· 
wou ld like to believe that they 
have a guardian angel looking 
after them, and the city of San 
Diego is no exception. New 

' York had Angels on their 
su bway and the crime rate 
went down. San Francisco had 
angel on their MUNI bu es to 
protect their patron and 
similarly the victims of crime 
diminis hed. 

The Guardian Angels were 
es tablished by Curt Si lwa in 
1979 to stop the crime on the 
New York subways and now 
there are 35 chapters 
nat ion wide, Most people dou ht 
the effectiveness of the Angels 
but stat istics show that the 
Angels are making their mark 
on the crime rate, They don't 
co ncern themselves with 
victim les s crime (drug 
dealings. etc.) not becausethey 
condone it but because Ihey 
feel thai is the police's job. 
Nevertheless. they are a visual 
deterrent that ha~ proved 
effective. 

The Angels are dedICated \0 
their work. Each completes a 
;3 1, month training course. 
They are I aught martial arts 
as well as CPR, first aid, and 
cnizens arrest. The directors 
of I he program su bject the 
members to verbal abuse 
before they are a llowed out 
onto the s treet s~ to detect 
bIgotry or aggressiveness long 
before they go ou t on pat roJ. 

They patrol in unpredict, 
able patterns. A robber might 
watch them walk by and see 
them emerge five minutes 
later coming from the same 
direction. From their 10th & C 
location they travel all the way 
down to the train station and 
back up again. 

They only use the necessary 
force and in most cases thev 
don' t use force at all. the~' 
med iate . They di ss pelled 
accusations of being a 
\. igilante group. "The peop'le 
\\ ho "av I hat we are." says Sir 
".I". "dem't kno'.\ whal \;"f' are 

about. .. 
Jonathan Williams likes to 

be called Ir "J". his name is 
sprawled across I he fronl of 
his red beret. lie i" tall and 
s lender , and looks more 
eighteen than 21. He looks like 
he would be more at home

than patrolling San Diego 
slreets at night. 'evertheless.

Cop, car, museum 
By MICHAEL AHN 

A cop car parked outside of 
my house can be intimidating 
thing sometimes, but not 
when it's mine. I bought the 
thing at a dealership, where 
thev had tried to clean it up by 
splashing new paint on it and 
Installing a new back seaL It 
looks like a police car, I guess it 
drives like one, The Blues 
Brother, were right; it does 
help to have cop tires, cop 
shocks, cop sway bars 
underneath a big throbbing V8 
engine under the hood, It was 
instant love when r first saw it 
but like all good affairs it has 
it . highs and low . 

The inside of the car is like 
some imprompto museum, 
where all history has been 
catalogued and noted in dent -
and graffiti and smell. The 
back seat had been caged and 
there are dents in the door 
and the side of a man's fisL 
There are the intials "SW" 
carved in a factory warranty 
stIcker on the WIndow, There 
are gaping holes in the 
dashboard where there used to 

be a radio an~ a ~hotgun 
holder. There are smaller 
holes In t he side front doors 
that used to have billy c1u b 
brackets, 

The smell was the must 
viVId part of the tour of t he cop 
car. It is gone now, chased 
away by Iysol and car 
fresheners and rushing wind. 
Getting into the ~ar for ~he 
first time was like taking 
eighteen different foods and 
shoving it all in my mouth at 
once, There were so many 
things but they all combined to 
give the effect of lot,S of bad 
craziness; rampant InsanIty. 
Sweat was there, but not like 
the locker room kind, The 
sweat in there wa more like 
sweat from co ld fear than from 
healthy work There were also 
the odors of dirt and cheap 
aftershave and urine and 
vomit, and driving around in it 
at first was lik/t travelling in 
the stomach of a )Ick dinosaur. 

I think maybe I'll be a real 
asshole and drive d VW rabbIt

Men's hoop busy during break 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

SlaH Wriler 
Nine road gamess and five 

weeks into the new sea on,a3· 
6 record, and a current fi ve-
game losing s treak, nothing 
could have been better for the 
UCSD men' s basketball team 
than the friendl y confines of 
Triton Pav ilion , A week ago 
today the Block Party took on a 
tough Di vis ion II school. Cal 
State Los Angele, in their 
home opener, and won going 
away 77-59 to raise their 
record to 4-6, But what is so 
di , tres,ing about this 
particular victory is that the 
Triton's played two entirely 
different ballgames - a good 
one, and a lousy one. 

In front of a sparse crowd, 
UCSD put on an impressive 
di splay in the first h,alf, 
running and gunn Ing 
themselves to a 45-26 lead. 
Mozart cou ldn 't have 
performed any better. But 
what Triton fans were 
subjected to in the final twenty 

minutes was a sloppy, 
lackluster sty le of play that 
was more reminiscent of 
Porky Pig than MozarL 

Twelve minutes mto the 
second stanza UCSD had 
scored all of ten points, and 
what once was a safe 19 IXlint 
lead had been sliced to eight, 
55·47, In fact, the contrast in 
the Triton performancE' from 
the first to second half was so 
drastIC that one had to wonder 
if the two teams didn't change 
uniforms at intermission, 
with the Golden Eagles now 
wearing lJCSD's blue and 
gold. 

To the Triton's credit, eight 
points was the closest CSULA 
would get, but If UCSD was 
playing someone of higher 
caliber, they might not have 
been so fortunate, "We were 
just a little flat in the second 
half and didn't execute the 
way we did in the first half." 
said Triton point guard Bob 
Goodman. "But it was nice to 

come home, and I can see our 
progress e\'ery game." 

Actually, if It wen' not fur 
Goodman's 2fi points (10 of I~ 
from the field) the end result 
probably would, ha\-e been 
different . BeSIdes sconng 
virtually at will. the senior

crumbling, But a Spartans 
often said during the Sparte· 
Athens wars, "a win is a win ." 

In mid-December, while 
most of t he student body was 
s kiing, partying, or doing 
whatever ones does during 
winter vacation , the men's 
team s tarted on a six gamc 
trek that took them to Los 
Angele , Idaho, and Wa ·hing· 
ton. First on the calendar was 
Occidental December 11th. 
and John Block 's squad 
with tood a last ditch rally by 
Oxy to win by t\\'o. 

But what followed was five 
tough road contests, all of 
which UC 'f) lost. The streak 
started at theoutsel of a three 
game swing I hrough Idaho, 
Los es to Nonhwest Na7arene 
(94-87), College of Idaho t 75-
66), and BOise State 16l'\·61)' 
coupled with defeats at the 
hands of Eastern Wa"hington 
L'll1\ersit\· (94-87t. and L'C 
Ki\,erside' (7067>. made the 
Tritons record plummet from 
3·1 to 3-6. 

Even though the win O\'er 
Cal·State LA was not a" 

ImJlre~~ive as it could havE' 
b~en a few key accomp li sh-
ments were made. One. a five· 
game losing streak was 
snapped, and two. the Tritons 
proved that they can put 
together one half of basketball 
of champIOnship ca liber. and 
they did it after playmg Illne 
tough road games. As Judy 
Garland once said so 
eloquent ly, "t here's no place 
like home."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL -
7·4 before their latest road tnp, UCSD's record has levelled at 7-7, the lat est lo~s 

coming ay SI. Mary's College, 85-54. T heir next. act ion comes in a home tou rnamen t thiS 
weeken . Opening action pits La Verne agamst UCSD at 7pm after Pomona ancl 
Redlands tip-off al 5 pm this Friday night. 

Volleyball virtuosity at UCSD 
continued from pn!(e 1 
at mosphere of lJCSD as the 
bench players stood the en tire 
game tn quiet contemplat ion. 
t:hanging expres~ion on ly 
\vhen Coach Doug Dannevik 
mapped out the next play. 

In ~harp contra.,t to the 
preCision of the Triton "Eye of 
the Tiger" Ix)wer players was 
the small college (9 00 
student~) team from La Verne. 
E\'cn though La Vernema} not 
ha\ e had t he experience. "ize, 
power. and home court 
advantage of t he Tritons. they 
did bring to the finals a 
confidence and enthusiasm 
sparked by their ear lier 
regular season victory over 
l'CSD, one that avenged their 
early ~eason loss. La Verne 
reminded us of the situation 
the Triton~ faced last ,ear. 

What these t\\O teams 
crepted was volleyball 
\ InLiosit~'. Thc net play wa~ a 
ba lance of t he act ive ancl the 
passi\'e. The mighty power of 

a spike deadened by the solid 
\',:all of outstretched arms. 

After each spike and 
Sli hsequent block. time secms 
to stop, The ba ll floats in a 
mot IOn less moment " 'hile IXll h 
teams wait for the ball to fall 
gently bark ll1to play. Once 
again t herc IS a ~el for a spike 
and the defenders prepare 10 
spring high for a bl<x'k, TIme 
stops again as the spiker tiP'" a 
soft lob ()\er the midair 
blockers. 'uddenh out of 
no\\ here. a back court digger 
saves Ihe point with a 
gymnast ic dive. And so the 
act ion continued for two hours 
of unparalleled quality. 

The record book resulH; of 
thi.., vear's Nationals will not 
be as' \'ve at UC D hacl hoped; 
thiS year was La Verne 's time 
to take home the honors. Now 
it seems filting that the 
Tritons ha\'e selected the 
Kocky [JI song as their theme, 
for these two teams will surely 
go t he distance toget her for 

another championship match-
up in the future. 

Nobody \\'ho \\'a~ there
