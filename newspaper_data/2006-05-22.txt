CRITICS 
SPEAR A.S. 
BUDGET 

Khanna changes college 
funding, as old rivals 
and current colleagues 
attack his allocations. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

Although A.S. President Harry 
Khanna's newest multimillion dollar 
budget is largely generous to cam-
pus organizations, college councils 
are protesting the slimmer funding 
offered to college-specific events. 

The first week of negotiations 
between A.S. councilmembers and 
Khanna has yielded four revisions 
to the budget, which currently sac-
rifices college-council funding for 
money reserved for campus wide 
organizations. Khanna's proposal 
cut college-council funding by about 
52,000 total from former President 
Christopher Sweeten's budget, while 
he kept money for student organiza-
tions at relatively the same level. 

The move was made to stream-
line the process through which 
student organizations receive fund -
ing, Khanna said. The more money 
placed in the campuswide pot, the 
less student organizations will com-
plain about current funding rules, 
which send them to each college 
council - all with different budget 
bylaws - to get money, Khanna 
said. 

Khanna also modified the struc-
ture of funding for student organiza-
tions by setting aside $72,700 for 
"tradition events;' including 57,000 
for the UCSD Cultural Celebration 
and $1,000 for the Black Student 
Union's Kwanzaa event. 

To qualify for that money, an 
event would have to have had consis-
tent student attendance for 10 years. 
Such criteria are not only arbitrary, 
but completely ignore multiple other 
campus programs, according to for-
mer A.S. presidential candidate and 
Earl Warren College senior Daniel 
Watts. 

"[Khanna is) giving special treat-
ment to other clubs that supported 
his slate, to the tune of $72,000, at 
the expense of every other student 
organization on campus;' Watts stat-
ed in an e-mail. 

Khanna denied any special treat-
ment in his budget, and said that 
entities that supported him during 
his presidential campaign, such as 
the Academic Success Program, suf-
fered reductions in his budget. 

Money for "tradition events" cuts 
off programs conducted by Sixth 
College, which has only been in exis-
tence since 2002. In its current state, 
the college will face many funding 
problems, according to Sixth College 
junior Senator Cindy Ly.

Student Fees Key In Scholarship Gameplan 
Academic Senate revamps 
contentious funding plan to 
support athletic ·department 
and scholarships. 

By Serena Renner 
STAFF WRITER 

After a year of discussion, disagreement 
and delay, the newest grants-in-aid proposal 
- which would allow UCSD to comply with 
NCAA athletic scholarship requirements - has 
been overhauled. While the initial plan would 
have funded the scholarships from registration 
fees , the Academic Senate recently endorsed a 
version of the proposal that would mandate an 
undergraduate vote on whether to pay for schol-
arships through a larger athletics fee next fall 
- a change that may have more impact than the 
Academic Senate has estimated. 

The student-fee referendum would increase 
the current quarterly athletics fee of $31 per 
student to a level that would stabilize the depart-
ment's budget to run programs, which fell into a 
5300,000 debt this year. 

Extra Innings 
Arguments between faculty, administrators 

and students regarding the deflated budget of the 
athletics department have drawn out negotia-
tions that began last year.

Students are set to vote on a referendum which will decide whether or not a fee increase should support athletic scholarships.

Campus launches Sex 

Safety Program 
The UCSD Student Safety and 

Sexual Assault Resource Center has 
launched a new program, sponsored 
by a grant from the U.S. Department 
of Education, to prevent sexual vio-
lence among university students by 
correcting students' exaggerated 
perceptions about fellow students' 
sexual activity. 
. The nevv program is aimed at 

bolstering rape prevention and 

sexual education and was based 
on a survey conducted last quarter 
that was sent to 6,000 randomly 
selected male and female students. 
The survey asked students to evalu-
ate their own beliefs about sexual 
behavior and rape prevention and 
to compare thE::m to those of the 
"typical UCSD student." 

"This new campaign will attempt 
to correct these misperceptions and 
share the healthy, positive behavior 
that is actually typical on this cam-
pUS," the center's Director Nancy 
Wahlig stated in a press release.

graduate in exactly 12 quarters, it is 
rare for a UCSD student to enroll for 
more than five years, according to 
UCSD's Office of Student Research 
and Information. 

Rapp will graduate this june after 
completing II full -time and two part-
time quarters at UCSD. Even with a 
hiatus after his second year was able to 
to graduate within five years. 

UCSD's four-year graduation rate 
exceeds the majority of other pub-
lic schools nationally, which gradu-
ate about half of its students in four 
years, according to SRI Director Bill 
Armstrong . . 

Students take an average of 13 
quarters to complete undergraduate 
requirements, and the campus' , six 
different colleges - each with their 
own criteria - add a more person-
al experience that keeps students on 
track, according to Vice Chancellor 
of Admissions and Registration Mae 

W. Brown. 
"I think the small college concept 

really works well for [UCSD]," Brown 
said. "It allows us to break down the 
large undergraduate population into 
smaller groups, and we're able to pro-
vide a home base for students." 

Based on 200 I statistics, the latest 
offered by Armstrong, Muir College 
leads with 60 percent of its students 
graduating within four years, followed 
by Revelle College and Thurgood 
Marshall College and Earl Warren 
College, all at 57 percent, and Eleanor 
Roosevelt College at 51 percent. 
Statistics have yet to be compiled for 
Sixth College. 

While Brown argued that UCSD's 
segregation into six colleges is an 
opportunity for more personal rela-
tions, Rapp said he felt indifferent 
about the divisions.

~ CENTER, from page 1 
through two lawsuits over city zon-
ing laws and La jolla community 
planning. 

"We won both the lawsuit and 
the appeal. and then San Diego fell 
apart;' Goldstein said. 

The 2005 corruption trials for 
San Diego Deputy Mayor Michael 
Zucchet and Councilman Ralph 
Inzunza caused instability in San 
Diego's leadership and delayed the 
approval process for construction. 
With new leadership in office, the 
campaign for a Hillel Center con-
tinued. 

john Muir College senior Neil 
Spears, a member of the Hillel of San 
Diego Board of Directors, headed an 
e-mail and telephone campaign to 
persuade the city council members to 
approve the construction. 

"[The center] will bea home away 
from home at college," Spears said. "I 
think it's going to make the jewish 
community more tightly knit and be 
a rallying point to gather around." 

Among the amenities to be 
included in the new center is a kosher 
kitchen and enough space to hold 
three concurrent Shabbat services, 
two obstacles the Jewish community 
has been struggling with on campus. 

"We'll have a kosher kitchen. 
which is huge," Goldstein said. "To 
have a place where we can just be, 
and be together, is huge. We're con-
stantly struggling to find space on 
campus." 

The city council approved the con-
struction in a 6-2 vote. It is expected 
to start next spring, once the official 
blueprints have been drawn up.

Sixth College, whose obscure 
logo appears to be a hockey stick 

ampus 
Repair 

djohnston@'lIcsd.edu 
getting friendly with the digit, has 
been without a namesake since its 
establishment in 2002. This puts it 
at a clear disadvantage with regards 
to incoming freshmen, as it lacks 
the name-brand recognition of other 
colleges; and I imagine it's a morale 
depressor for Sixth students much 
like it would be for a child: "This is 
Michael, our oldest, and then Jacob, 
Amy, Anthony, Christina and Sixth." 

What Sixth College needs, and its 
students deserve, is a namesake who 
embodies the spirit of the college 
and acts as its proud symbol. That 
person will need to fit the college's 
mission of integrating culture. art, 
technology.and networking, and will 
probably need to comply with the 
implied criteria for UCSD college 
namesakes: historical significance, 
progressiveness (if you think about 
it) and familiarity. 

Another criterion we may want to 
consider is picking a namesake who 
could in a way sponsor his/her college. 
I've been to Sixth College, and it has . 
its charms, but what it really needs is 
a reason for students across UCSD 
to go there. Marshall has Oceanview 
Terrace, Roosevelt has International 
House parties and Revelle has argu-
ably the best food on campus. An 
alI-you-can-eat dining hall, a state-of-
the-art computer lab, or something 
else unique and amazing, fmanced by 
the namesake, would make the college 
a place students seek out, rather than 
simply a place to eat or do homework. 

The final element necessary to 
nan1ing Sixth College is active stu-
dent involvement. You may recall 
last year when the Guardian reported 
the surprising announcement that 
administrators had selected former 
UC Preside'nt and UCSD Chancellor 
Richard C. Atkinson to be the college's 
namesake. The subsequent uproar by 
students and the A.S. Council over the 
infinitesimal student input prompted 
Atkinson to honorably withdraw his 
name from the running. 

That development was an impres-
sive sign of how times have changed. 
Marshall was stuck as "Third College" 
for 23 years because students wanted 
to name it after a 20th century revo-
lutionary such as Patrice Lumumba 
or Emiliano Zapata, and the adminis-
tration opposed that idea. Only after 
the death of Chief Justice Marshall in 
1993 was the choice clear to all par-
ties involved. 

To get the ball rolling on student 
input, I've come up with a few sug-

n May 10, board members of tlie Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers, the group respon-
sible for managing the Internet domain name system, 
voted 9-5 against creation of an ".xxx" domain. 

Socially conservative groups like the Family 
Research Coupci l, which opposed the new 
domain on grounds that it would "validate" 
pornography and make it even more acces-
sible, were ecstatic. "This would have been 
a land grab for pornographers, and (CANN 
did absolutely the right thing," said FRC Vice 
President Charmaine Yoest in an interview 
with Bloomberg. 

Ironically, those same conservatives found 
themselves in bed (so to speak) with the Free 
Speech Coalition, a porn industry trade group 
that also opposed the ".xxx" domain, fearing 
it would facilitate government censorship. Yet 
ICANN's major objection to the proposalliad 
little to do with pornography or censorship, 
instead hinging on worries that (CANN would 
be trapped into enforCing the world's varying 
obscenity laws - even though it has never 
been responsible for the regulation of Internet 
content. 

Welcome to the strange and tentative world 
of Internet regulation. 

The moral wrangling of conservatives and 
the porn industry has obscured the basic facts 
of the proposed ".xxx" domain . For starters, the 
reason for creating the domain is not pornog-
raphy - but cold, hard cash. 

(CM Registry LLD, the internet company 
that has been pushing for the ".xxx" domain 
since 2000, argues that the new domain will 
protect Internet users from unethical busin~ss 
practices and make it easier for individuals to 
avoid adult content if they wish. Nevermind 
that the ".xxx" domain would be administered 
by - surprise! - (CM Registry, which would 
cbntrol the lucrative registration rights to the 
new domain. 

And while ICM would require ".xxx" regis-
trants to follow a commendable set of business 

codes designed to protect consumers from ille-
gal material and malicious marketing scripts, it 
also stands to make a nifty profit from the reg-
istration of new sites - wh'ich some Internet 
junkies claim might be as much as $75 per 
TCgistered address per year. 

With the debate about porn stripped away, 
it's easier to see that ICANN's rejection of the 
new domain has fairly weak justifications. 

ICANN claims it shot down the proposal 
because it feared the organization would end 
up "in a difficult position of having to enforce 
all of the world's laws governing pornography, 
including ones that might require porn sites to 
use the domain." 

But ICANN is in chaege of assigning IP 
addresses and the domain names associated 
with those addresses. 

The company does not enforce laws regard-
ing content, instead leaving legal disputes to 
individual sites or domain registry operators. 
ICM's ".xxx" proposal even went out of its way 
to address this concern, specifically noting that 
ICANN's legal obligations would be limited 
to enforcing the organization's contract with 
(CM Registry, and not enforcing agreements 
between [CM and its registrants, or between 
registrants and legal entities . 

Why all the hubbub, then? 
It's an unfortunate case of a simple admin-

istrative decision being overshadowed by a 
socially charged issue - an issue that is par-
ticularly sensitive to a constituency with sub-
stantial sway in the U.S. government. 

In June 2005, as ICANN agreed to enter 
negotiations with ICM Registry about the new 
domain, the U.S. Department of Commerce 
wa, indifferent, with internal memos claim-
ing the department had no role in the 'inter-
nal governance or day-to-day regulation of 

[ICANN)." 
[n the following months, however, conserva-

. tive groups sent over 6,()()() e-mails to the depart-
ment, arguing that a new porn-only domain 
would be harmful to families and children. After 
receiving memos from the department expressing 

/ concern about the issue, ICANN tabled the vote 
on the ".xxx" domain until 2006. 

Fast-forward to the present. 
Following ICANN's "no" vote two weeks 

ago, (CM Registry submitted a In-page appeal 
to the organization, alleging that it had mis-
interpreted input from foreign governments, 
ignored its own standards for creating spon -
soeed, top-level domains, and bowed to pres-
sure from the Department of Commerce to 
reject the proposal. 

By and large, these allegations appear to 
be well-supported. Of the foreign-input docu-
ments (CANN has made public, none express 
substantive opposition to the. ".xxx" domain. 
And ICANN has had no legal qualms about 
creating content-specific domains in the past, 
establishing ".aero" and ".museum" sponsored 
domains in 2001 for the aerospace and muse-
um industries, respectively. 

Furthermore, the WaU Street Journal 
reviewed an internal memo from the 
Department of Commerce (unambiguously 
titled "United States Control of the Dbmain 
Name System") that confirms the department's 
new stance on the issue. 

"If the international community decides to 
develop an .xxx domain for adult material," the 
memo states, "it will not go on the Top Level 
Domain (TLD) registry if the U.S. does not 
wish for that to happen."

Students Should .Be In 
Charge of Naming Process 

Romancing the Past: History On Film 
• JOHNSTON, from page 4 
gested namesakes for the college, each 
with his/her own pros and cons: 

I. Gore College, named after for-
mer Vice President Al Gore. Pros: 
is an environmentalist: played an 
influential role in the expansion of 
the Internet (technology and net-
working); and is now a filmmaker 
and a writer (culture and art). Cons: 
arguable hi torical Significance; may 
not have enough money for support; 
and will upset campus conservatives. 
Also, for better or for worse, "Gore 
College" is just asking for visits by 
Wes Craven and Eli Roth. 

2. Lucas College, named after 
beloved filmmaker George Lucas of 
"Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" f{"me. 
Pros: his film have major cultural 
and sometimes artistic significance; 
he's been instrumental in the develop-
ment of digital effects (technology); 
and his personal wealth, as estimated 
by Forbes Magazine in 2004, is about 
53 billion (pre-Episode III). Cons: 
his historical significance isn't on par 
with Earl Warren and John Muir; and 
he has connections to USc. 

3. Wood. College, named after 
trailblazing championship golfer 
Eldrick "Tiger" Woods. Pros: his cul-
tural significance - with helping to 
break unspoken racial barriers - is 
clear; he's a very charitable man whose 
wealth continues to grow; he has a 
San Diego connection with the Buick 
Invitational that he keeps winning; 
and "Woods College" will appeal to 
environmentalists and sorority girls 
alike. Cons: less historical signifi-
cance than other college namesakes: 
weak connection to art and technol-
ogy; and the irony of naming a col-
lege of UCSD after an athlete. 

4. O'Connor College, named after 
recently retired Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor. Pros: everyone 
loves a moderate; her historical sig-

nificance has been her decid ing votes 
in several major cases; and unlike the 
current Supreme Court, our colleges 
would be represented by more than 
one woman. Cons: a limited connec-
tion to technology; unclear finances; 
and two Supreme Court justices have . 
already been recognized in college 
names. 

5. Oprah (or Winfrey) College, 
named after the award-winning tele-
vision host, publisher and literary 
advocate. Pros: slrong association 
with many aspects of culture and 
art: double diversification of college 
namesakes: is tremendously wealthy 
and charitable (Keynote graduation 
speech: "You get a car! You get a car!"); 
and is respected in many ci rcles. Cons: 
not much con nection to technology 
beyond her Web site; no apparent San 

. Diego connection. 
6. Newmark CoUege. after 

Craigslist.org founder Craig Newmark. 
Pros: clear link to technology and 
networking; college students love 
him; doesn't isolate anyone political-
ly; moderate wealth; and "Newmark 
College" is catchy. Cons: connected to 
San Francisco, not San Diego. 

Sixth College is at a crossroads, 
and the potential for another unfor-
tunate episode of prolonged anonym-
ity is there. The time has come to 
dust ourselves off from the Atkinson 
affair and engage a reasonable process 
through which the namesake will be 
selected. I suggest going about it like 
a bill in the legislature. As Congress, 
Sixth College students would pro-
pose and vote on their nominations 
until they've reached a majority deci-
sion. Administrators, as the executive 
branch, would retain veto power over 
an unacceptable namesake, but they 
shouldn't expect to use it. If students 
are given the awesome responsibility 
of honoring their college, they will do 
it justice. You can count on that.

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Fantastical disaster and war movies aside, Hollywood does not often do serious 
history. Despite the many dramat-
ic storylines it might provide, it's 
always a turn-off to have to limit 
the number of explosions you can 
have, and for calmer dramas the 
realness of characters puts perhap 
an undue restri ction on scriptwrit-
ers. 

When Hollywood does history 
it tends to take 
it over rather 

flashbacks, narrative voice-over, or 
any addition \0 the events unfold -
ing before the camera, "United 93" 
is presented as history on film - it 
is a faithful representation of the 
events of that day ; at least as faith -
ful as can be made considering the 
limited source material. 

Some have suggested that it was 
too early to make any on of film 
out of Sept. II - but "United 93" is 
exactly the type of film that can be 
made at such an early point. Fil ms 
made about events decades or cen-
turies removed 

than present 
it - using the 
historical basis 
merely for a 
convenie.nt 
allent ion grab 
and simplistic 
protagonistl 
antagonist plot. 
Historical films 
rarely live up to 
their potential; 
thus viewers 
who went to 
"Pearl Harbor" 
for a serious 
reflection on 
the event that 
started WWII 
were instead 
treated with a 
painfully sappy 

Without flashbacks, 

are usually inter-
pretive pieces 
- they take an 
aspect of the 
historical event 
and shape it to 
make a particu-
lar point about 
its well-known 

narrative voice-over, 
or any addition 

to the events 
unfolding before 

the camera, "United 
93" is presented 

as history on film 
- it is a faithful 

representation of the 
events of that day •• :' 

consequences . 
"Uni ted 93 ," 
however, by 
depicting events 
that happened a 
mere five years 
ago, does not 
reflect on any-
thing. We're still 
in the midst of 
the fallout of 
Sept. 1 I, and 
there's no space 
to step back 
and try to make 

and poorly acted romance that, to 
top it off, starred Ben Affleck. 

However, when films do deal 
with history in a serious or unusual 
way, the rare event can shed much 
light on deeper undercurrents in 
society, even when presented as 
mindless entertainment. 

Fortunately, the recently 
released "United 93" is a movie that 
does history well and without any 
mindlessness whatsoever. Without 

an interpretive ' 
statement on film. 

It will be interesting to contrast 
"United 93" with "The Da Vinci 
Code:' which came out May 19. 
"The Da Vinci Code," as a book, 
cannot even count as historical fic -
tion - it's more like fictional histo-
ry. Nevertheless, the crowds will be 
drawn to the theater not because 
"The Da Vinci Code" was a great 
book and will make a great film, 
but because of the central thesis of

"The Da Vinci Code" - that the 
entire history of Christianity has 
been a fraud, and the true history 
of the Catholic church is one of 
perpetual corruption. Without that 
radical proposition, "The Da Vinci 
Code" would have been an unre-
markable mystery novel, gathering 
no more attention than any other. 

In that sense, "The Da Vi nci 
Code" is a historical film in the 
sa me way that "The Passion of the 
Christ" was a historical film . T~e 
immen e reaction to both. works 
reflects a strong and significant 
hi storical curre nt - our modern 
society's c<mtinuing fluctuations in 
attempting to understand the role 
of religion in our lives. 

That the Catholic church con-
siders Ihe book and film to be 
a result of ignorance and malice 
toward the church is reflective of 
the concern over how many people 
actually take "The Da Vinci Code" 
and its alternative history to heart. 
Although the book has always been 
labeled fiction, readers are clearly 
carrying it further when interna-
tional tours across Europe ta'ke 
visitors to see sights where noth-
ing happened and monuments that 
were never mysterious. 

Still, some might go to see 
"The Da Vinci Code" to be enter-
tained - but they n.evertheless will 
be feasting on a plot that sub-
tly manipulates centuries of anti-
Catholicism in Anglo-Saxon cul-
ture, as well as participating in the 
new enthusiasm for what can aptly 
be called "New Age Christianity," 
where Jesus is made less orthodox 
and entirely more approachable 
conSidering he, too, got laid now 
and then. 

Yet another species of the semi-
historical film, "National Treasure; 
differs greatly from the compara-

~ DOMAIN, from page 4 
does? 

And so it goes: A straightfor-
ward decision about whether to cre-
ate a sponsored, top-level domain is 
hijacked by a handful of concerned 

. but misguided 
citizens. 

porn, let's not overlook the fact that 
the American porn industry makes 
an estimated $12 biUion annually. 
For reference, that's more than all 
professional baseball, football and 
basketball franchises make com-

bined. Perhaps 
America has a 
new pastime. The iragedy 

is that even if the 
debate were about 
pornography, the 
arguments of both 
conservatives and 

parents could 
easily configure 
Internet filters to 

Both the 
porn indus -
try and social 
conservatives 
have valid con-
cerns. The right 
of consenting 
adults to access 
whatever infor-
mation they 
choose . must 
be safeguarded; 
and parents 
should have the 
ability to protect 

the porn industry 
against the ".xxx" 
domain would be 
shaky at best. 

screen out all sites 
with the '.xxx' sUffix. 

The pornog- -
raphy industry's 
contention that 
the ".xxx" domain 
would cause the 
"ghettoization" of 
porn Web sites 

Try doing that with 
C .com' or ' .net' 

addresses." 

overlooks the voluntary nature of the 
newdomain.ICM Registry's proposal 
does not require porn sites to pur-
chase ".xxx" addresses or surrender 
existing addresses in other domains. 
If pornographers want to keep their 
".com" Web sites, they can. 

Similarly, the Family Research 
Council's claim that an ".xxx" domain 
would make pornography easier to 
acCess is also poorly reasoned. Public 
libraries and wary parents could eas-
ily configure Internet filters to screen 
out all sites with the ".xxx" suffIX. 
Try doing that with ".com" or ".net" 
addresses. 

As for the argument that an 
".xxx" domain would "legitimize" 

their children as 
they see fit. The reconciliation of 
these two ideas can only be accom-
plished with fair and earnest input 
from both sides. 

But ICANN, .an international -
based organization charged with 
managing I P addresses, is hardly 
the forum for an argument about 
American social principles. 

Sadly, the current debate over-
shadows good ideas that address 
the concerns of the porn industry 
and conservatives alike, such as the 
creation of a child-friendly ".kids· 
domain. Hopefully we can refocus 
the debate on solutions like this, 
instead of wasting Our time defend-
ing the hard lines. 

Decoding Hollywood's 
Newest Historical Facts 
~ FILM, from page 5 
tively serious "The Da Vinci Code." 
"National Treasure" merely plasters 
historical facts and figures onto a 
preconceived storyline (ironically, 
one clearly inspired by the dynam-
ics of "The Da Vinci Code") to 
add color to its suspense. Many 
claim this shape-shifting of clear 
historical facts is harmJess, and that 
viewers are perfectly aware that the 
founding fathers were not part of an 
international Freemason conspiracy 
to hide the greatest treasure known 
to man. 

It is true that those who saw 
"National Treasure" when it was 
released probably did not so eas-
ily confuse history and entertain-
ment - however, there will most 
likely be a long-term effect. As the 
plot line itself becomes removed 
from its source - the film - such 
ideas will slip into the general public 
indirectly. You could easily hear a 
young man claiming, a few decades 
from now, that all the founders 
were Freemasons (an idea fed by 
the fact that many were) and that 
they all hid a special treasure from 
the British. He probably wouldn't 
remember exactly where he got the 
idea, but he would be pretty sure it 
was true. 

Will such similar fact-twisting be 
conaoned decades from now with 
such events as Sept. II? After all, the 
founders of a nation would conceiv-
ably be figures a society would want 
to depict accurately and favorably 
- and yet our founders were, in 
fact, manipulated almost as soon as 
they died. 

Yet these manipulations usually 
had a deeper cultural purpose, and 
even a mm as apparently trivial as 
"National Treasure" actually does 
have some~hing significant to say 
about American history. The fact 
that a "Freemason conspiracy" plot 
could fly in the first place is indica-
tive not only of America's past and 
continuing suspicion of its own gov-
ernment, but Its deep speculation 
that the elite people of the nation . 
are not content simply being rich 
and privileged. but have to be up to 

something much larger. 
So where does that leave 

Hollywood in regard to history? 
Does it have an ethical obligation to 
not manipulate and mold the past 
too much to its advantage? Or is his-
tory, like any other cultural product, 
fair game for entertainment? 

Do we like our national myths, 
such as Paul Revere's ride (a measly 
19-mile journey) and the poetic rep-
resentation of Washington crossing 
the Delaware? Or would we prefer 
to be very distinct and very precise 
about names, places and dates? 

Whatever we believe, it unfor-
tunately is not our choice in the 
end - myths propagate themselves. 
legends are born and thrive, and 
people will always believe false his-
tory because each social interest in 
society uses history in its own way. 
While "United 93" avoids these pit-
falls, it ie merely a matter of time 
before future filmmakers are bolder 
and more biased with their presen-
tations of Sept. II. 

When those films appear, their 
propriety and purpose will be debat-
ed • and pontificated on plenty, just 
as "The Da Vinci Code" is inspir-
ing discussions on Catholicism and 
ancient Christianity. The straight-
forward style of "United 93" indi-
cates an inability, and unwmingness, 
to open such a debate on Sept. II at 
this early point - until the Iraq war 
has cooled considerably or major 
changes have taken place in the 
Middle East, we won't really begin 
to see the major cultural manipula-
tions of Sept. 11. 

And while there will always be 
strict historians ready to point out 
factual errors and misrepresenta-
tions in historical ftlm, the diJcus-
sion such films spur can bring his-
tory out of the cupboard and into 
popular culture. In fact, while being 
stingy about what belongs under 
the title "historical" will keep us 
more clear about what happened 
yesterday. remaining open to the 
influences. ligns and symbols in 
historical fiction - or fictional his-
tory - will tell us much more about 
ounelves today.

Disparity Huge Between 
Graduation Rates of CSU, UC THE SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
~ COLLEGES, from page 2 
ure out how to get to graduation was 
the 'Finish in Four' book Muir gives 
you and my online degree audit; 
Rapp said. "I had a very limited inter-
action with advisers or any other 
programs." 

In 2004, the most recent year for 
which statistics are available, UCSD 
held the UC system's third-highest 
one-year retention rate at 95 per-
cent; the percentage of students who 
return after their first year trail, only 
UCLA and UC Berkeley. 

Unfortunately, students at other 
colleges still drop out at high rates. 
Only about half of all freshmen 
enrolled in four-year universities 
get their degrees within sill years 
nationally, according to the San Diego 
Union-Tribune. But these circum-
stances aren't common among UC 
students, especially at UCSD. 

"[UCSD's retention ratel has a 
lot to do with the fact that we admit 
a quality applicant pool," Brown 
said. "We're selective - we receive 
more applications than we are able to 
accommodate, and because we're able 
to select from the top 12.5 percent [of 
California high school graduates) , we 
are getting some of the best-qualified 
students." 

UCSD's graduation and retention 
rates excel compared to Ihe neighbor-
ing San Diego State - most notably 
in the area of helping students gradu-
ate on time and preparing them for 
professional jobs after college. 

"When we studied what allowed 
students to be most successful at 
SDSU .. . academic preparation was 
the single most important variable (or 
academic success," San Diego State 
Executive Director of Enrollment 
Services Sandra Cook said. "That 
being said, there are some institutions 
whose graduation rates are higher 
than would be predicted by the aca-

demic preparation of the students 
they admil." 

The large gap is reason for con-
cern, according to state Sen. Jackie 
Speier (D-San Francisco/San Mateo), 
who sits on the Assembly Higher 
Education Subcommittee. 

"There is a large focus on outreach 
for colleges,' she said. "But there is a 
large hole in the concentration on 
helping students graduate on time." 

Speier was especially concerned 
about the gap between the rates of UC 
graduates and those at the California 
State University. According to 200 1 
statistics, although San Diego State's 
four-year .graduation rate has been 
improving, it is still far below UC 
figures. In fall 2004, only 82.1 percent 
of students came back for a second 
year. 

The CSU system's broad applicant 
pool is linked to the lagging rates, but 
Cook said that Ihe implementation 
of programs - such as Freshman 
Success and mentoring services - to 
improve retention and graduation 
numbers. 

Also, more students at UCSD are 
declaring majors within their first 
two years; the 13.1 percent of unde-
clared students in 1995 decreased to 
9.4 percent in 2005. 

Based on the 200 I graduating 
class, one-third of UCSD graduates 
pursued degrees from graduate or 
professional schools and more than 
half of those graduates enrolled in 
doctorate programs. 

After five years, 62 percent of 
the graduates have completed, or are 
enrolled in, an advanced degree pro-
gram, and 93 percent of UCSD grad-
uates are employed in a professional 
field of their choice or are pursuing 
more education.

overlooks the voluntary nature of the

does not require porn sites to pur-
chase ".xxx" addresses or surrender 
existing addresses in other domains. 
If pornographers want to keep their 
".com" Web sites, they can. 

Similarly, the Family Research 
Council's claim that an ".xxx" domain 
would make pornography easier to 
acCess is also poorly reasoned. Public 
libraries and wary parents could eas-
ily configure Internet filters to screen 
out all sites with the ".xxx" suffil(.

As for the argument that an

ability to protect 
their children as 

they see fit. The reconciliation of 
these two ideas can only be accom-
plished with fair and earnest input 
from both sides. 

But ICANN, .an international-
based organization charged with 
managing I P addresses, is hardly 
the forum for an argument about 
American social principles. 

Sadly, the current debate over-
shadows good ideas that address 
the concerns of the porn industry 
and conservatives alike, such as the 
creation of a child ·friendly ".kids" 
domain. Hopefully we can refocus 
the debate on solutions like this, 
instead of wasting our time defend-
ing the hard lines. 

Decoding Hollywood's 
Newest Historical Facts 
~ FILM, from page 5 
tively serious "The Da Vinci Code." 
"National Treasure" merely plasters 
historical facts and figures onto a 
preconceived sto..,line (ironically, 
one clearly inspired by the dynam-
ics of "The Oa Vinci Code") to 
add color to its suspense. Many 
claim this shape-shifting of clear 
historical facts is harmless, and that 
viewers are perfectly aware that the 
founding fathers were not part of an 
international Freemason conspiracy 
to hide the greatest treasure known 
to man. 

It is true that those who saw 
"National Treasure" when it was 
released probably did not so eas-
ily confuse history and entertain-
ment - however, there will most 
likely be a long-term effect. As the 
plot line itself becomes removed 
from its source - the film - such" 
ideas will slip into the general public 
indirectly. You could easily hear a 
young man claiming, a few decades 
from now, that all the founders 
were Freemasons (an idea fed by 
the fact that many were) and that 
they all hid a special treasure from 
the British. He probably wouldn't 
remember exactly where he got the 
idea, but he would be pretty sure it 
was true. 

Will such similar fact -twisting be 
condoned decades from now with 
such events as Sept. II? After all, the 
founders of a nation would conceiv-
ably be figures a society would want 
to depict accurately and favorably 
- and yet our founders were, in 
fact, manipulated almost as soon as 
they died. 

Yet these manipulations usually 
had a deeper cultural purpose, and 
even a film as apparently trivial as 
"National Treasure" actually does 
have some!hing significant to say 
about American history. The fact 
that a "Freemason conspiracy" plot 
could fly in the first place is indica-
tive not only of America's past and 
continuing suspicion of its own gov-
ernment. but its deep speculation 
that the elite people of the nation . 
are not content limply bein& rich 
and privileged, but have to be up to 

something much larger. 
So where does that leave 

Hollywood in regard to history? 
Does it have an ethical obligation to 
not manipulate and mold the past 
too much to its advantage? Or is his-
tory, like any other cultural product, 
fair game for entertainment? 

Do we like our national myths, 
such as Paul Revere's ride (a measly 
19-mile journey) and the poetic r~p­
resentation of Washington crossing 
the Delaware? Or would we prefer 
to be very distinct and very precise 
about names, places and dates? 

Whatever we believe, it unfor-
tunately is not our choice in the 
end - myths propagate themselves, 
legends are born and thrive, and 
people will always believe false his-
tory because each social interest in 
society uses history in its own way. 
While ·United 93" avoids these pit-
falls, it it merely a matter of time 
before future filmmakers are bolder 
and more biased with their presen-
tations of Sept. 11. 

When those films appear, their 
pr~priety and purpose will be debat-
ed and pontificated on plenty, just 
as "The Da Vinci ~ode" is inspir-
ing discussions on Catholicism and 
ancient Christianity. The straight-
forward style of ' United 93" indi-
cates an inability, and unwillingness, 
to open such a debate on Sept. 11 at 
this early point - until the Iraq war 
has cooled considerably or major 
changes have taken place in the 
Middle East, we won't really begin 
to see the major cultural manipula-
tions of Sept. II. 

And while there will always be 
strict historians ready to point out 
factual errors and misrepresenta-
tions in historical film, the discus-
sion such films spur can bring his-
tory out of the cupboard and into 
popular culture. [n fact, while being 
stingy about what belongs under 
the title "historical" will keep us 
more clear about what happened 
yesterday, remaining open to the 
influences, signs and symbols in 
historical fiction - or fictional hil-
tory - will tell UI much more about 
ounelva today,

Disparity Huge Between 
Graduation Rates of CSU, UC 
~ COlLE<JES, from page 2 
ure out how to get to graduation was 
the 'Finish in Four' book Muir gives 
you and my online degree audit," 
Rapp said. "I had a very limited inter-
action with advisers or any other 
programs." 

In 2004, the most recent year for 
which statistics are available, UCSD 
held the UC system's third-highest 
one-year retention rate at 95 per-
cent; the percentage of students who 
return after their first year trails only 
UCLA and UC Berkeley. 

Unfortunately, students at other 
colleges still drop out at high rates. 
Only about half of all freshmen 
enrolled in four-year universities 
get their degrees within six years 
nationally, according to the San Diego 
Union- Tribune . But these circum-
stances aren't common among UC 
students, especially at UCSO. 

"[UCSO's retention rate] has a 
lot to do witb the fact that we admit 
a quality applicant pool: Brown 
said. "We're selective - we receive 
more applications than we are able to 
accommodate, and because we're able 
to select from the top 12.5 percent [of 
California high school graduates). we 
are getting some of the best-qualified 
students." 

U CSO's graduation and retention 
rates excel compared to the neighbor-
ing San Diego State - most notably 
in the area of helping students gradu-
ate on time and preparing them for 
professional jobs after college. 

"When we studied what allowed 
students to be most successful at 
SOSU ... academic preparation was 
the single most important variable for 
academic success," San Diego State 
Execulive Director of Enrollment 
Services Sandra Cook said. "That 
being said, there are some institutions 
whose graduation rates are higher 
than would be predicted by the aca-

demie preparation of the students 
they admit.-

The large gap is reason for con-
cern, according to state Sen. Jackie 
Speier (D-San Francisco/San Mateo), 
who sits on the Assembly Higher 
Education Subcommittee. 

"There is a large focus on outreach 
for coUeges," she said. "But there is a 
large hole in the concentration on 
helping students graduate on time." 

Speier was especially concerned 
about the gap between the rates ofUC 
graduates and those at the California 
State University. According to 200 I 
statistics, although San Diego State's 
four-year .graduation rate has been 
improving, it is still far below UC 
figures. In fall 2004, only 82.1 percent 
of students came back for a second 
year. 

The CSU system's broad applicant 
pool is linked to the lagging rates, but 
Cook said that the implementation 
of programs - such as Freshman 
Success and mentoring services - to 
improve retention and graduation 
numbers. 

Also, more students at UCSD are 
declaring majors within their first 
two years: the 13.1 percent of unde-
clared students in 1995 decreased to 
9.4 percent in 2005. 

Based on the 200 I graduating 
class, one-third of UCSD graduates 
pursued degrees from graduate or 
professional schools and more than 
half of those graduates enrolled in 
doctorate programs. 

After five years, 62 percent of 
the graduates have completed, or are 
enrolled in, an advanced degree pro-
gram, and 93 percent ofUCSD grad-
uates are employed in a professional 
field of their choice or are pursuing 
more education.

SITE SEEN I PEOPLE'S ORGANIC FOODS MARKET 
Instead of an overwhelmingly large warehouse filled with commer-

cial food. the Ocean Beach People's Organk Foods Market is a different 
kind of grocery shopping experience. 

This store has everything from produce, groceries, dairy, bulk foods, 
herbs and vitamins to body care and aromatherapy products. What is 
different here, though, is that the market is dedkated to carrying prod-
ucts that are nutritious, organkally grown, cruelty-free and produced in 
an environmentally sound manner. If you're looking for the butcher, you 
will not find her at this vegetarian and vegan establishment. 

Open and luminescent from natural light the People's Market is a 
nke change from the typically windowless, dungeon-like grocery stores. 
Constructed with recycled material and designed in an eca-minded 
fashion, the building rhat houses the market reflects this "green" phi-
losophy. The building produces about one-third of the energy it uses 
through photovoltaic cells located on the roof of the building. 

The 08 People's Market Is San Diego's only cooperative, or co-op, 
meaning that the store is owned and operated by its 7,000 members. 
By paying a yearly charge of $1 5 you become a member and have the 
opportunity to eKert direct Influence on the store, like having say pver 
what products and services the co-op provides. Becoming a member is 
recommended to avoid the 10 percent surcharge placed on shoppers 
who are not members. 

Being a co-op also means that the money you spend won't go to' 
fund some rkh private owner's third yacht, but rather, back Into the co-
op and the local community. So, while you might be able to get good 
organic food at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. those stores are privately 
owned and do not put the money back into the community the way 
the co-op does. 

Up the sustainable wood stairs, you'll find a vegetarian and vegan 
deli and bakery. There, you choose from a menu that can include any-
thing from lasagna to broccoli and kale stir-fry. The soups are especially 
good and the salad bar especially fresh. Try Thursday's flavorful Chinese 
rainbow stew, a colorful mix of seasoned vegetables and tofu in a coco-
nut milk and miso broth . 

The bakery also has a daily menu, but on any day, you'll be sure to 
find an array of cookies, muffins and bars. The goddess bar - a delight-
ful combination of nuts and seeds bound together by chocolate - is an 
especially e)(ceptional find. 

The indoor/outdoor dining areas are great places to enjoy a meal 
among the eclectic OB crowd or for just wandering around to check out 
the artwork for sale by local artists that decorates the building. Friday 
evenings are lively in the deli with free, live acoustic music from 5:30 
p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

MONDAY, MAY 22, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

New Pressures Make 'Volunteer' the New Activism 
• ACTIVISM, from page 8 
Thomas Bond, Revelle Plaza was the 
heart of all student activism at UCSD. 
Bond even recalls a time when Urey 
Hall was shut down during one protest 
and the campus came close to having a 
student -police confrontation. 

On May lO, 1970, Revelle Plaza saw 
student George Winne Jr. light him-
self on fire, mimicking the Buddhist 
monks in Vietnam as a way to protest 
U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. 
He died as a result of his actions. 

Not only were students more 
involved in those turbulent years, but 
professors were also active participants 
during protests. Herbert Marcuse, a 
renowned . philosophy professor from 
Germany, spoke at rallies, inspiring a 
number of people, including former 
UCSD student Angela Davis, a mem-
ber of the Black Panthers and a well · 
known radical feminist and activist. 

"Marcuse taught me it was pos-
sible to be an academic and an activist. 
a scholar and a revolutionary, Davis 
said in an interview for "Herbert's 
Hippopotamus;' the 1996 docu-
mentary by UCSD film student Paul 
Alexander Juutilainen. 

Marcuse's speeches and critiques on 
capitalist society resonated with leftist 
student movemenls. According to the 
documentary, some saw Marcuse as a 
threat and Ronald Reagan, Ihe gover-
nor of California at the time, tried to 
lerminate Marcusc from his position 
at UCSD. Then-chancellor William 
McGill , however, denied the request 
and Marcuse remained teaching until 
his retirement. 

UCSD was rich with activism in the 
past, whether students took their own 
initiative or were influenced by Iheir 
professors. Over the years, however, 
the kind of student aClivism that was 
present in the late 1960 and early '70s 
appears to have faded away. Students 
seem 10 focus more on grades. admis-
sion to graduate school and being able 
to make tuition payments. 

Bond said that because of bigger 
financial burdens, student involvement 
in social issues has shifted from protest 

to service. 
"There is less activism today, but 

I think ... that there is far more stu -
dent volunteer work than before .. . 
and students today are carrying more 
deb I than before and having to work 
a lot;' he said . 

Jeffrey Haydu, a sociology professor 
currently teaching "Social Movements 
and Social Protest;' agrees that stu · 
dents are active on a smaller scale, 
mostly through volunteer work. 

"It's important to think about how 
local issues are connected to larger 
structures of power and equality and 
that means the small projects through 
which we help others on campus or in 
the community should really go hand 
in hand with broader struggles for 
social change," Haydu said. 

According to Mary Tharin, co· 
chair for UCSD Cares Week, the yearly 
event that showcases service organi· 
zations on campus was successful in 
getting students more involved with 
community service. 

"The student body was enthusias-
tic and engaged in doing community 
service work. whether il was to make 
a craft for kids or make a donation;' 
Tharin said. " I think that there's defi-
nitely a strong sense lonl campus 10 
have that kind of activism and to help 
out the community." 

Earl Warren College freshman 
Jaimie Trinh, who is a member of 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Azthin, participated in recent protests 
in San Ysidro for immigration rights, 
and said that there are those who 
believe that social change should be 
accomplished through education. She 
said that the priority placed on higher 
education makes it difficult for students 
to realize the importance of activism. 

"I Students) end up solely fOCUSing 
on getting out of coUege and passing 
the next midterm, rather trying to see 
what else is going on," Trinh said. "It's 
hard to find that balance." 

At UCSD, a science·oriented uni-
versity, students work hard to keep up 
their grades and fulfill their academic 
goals, not leaving much time for any-

thing else . 
Eleanor Roosevelt CoUege sopho· 

more Montha Pao, a biology student, 
said that petitioners stopped her on 
Library Walk and she quickly signed 
forms without 'thinking much about it. 

"I would want to be more involved 
but it's too hard, espedally when I'm 
majoring in a cience," Pao said. 

Recently, student organizations took 
part in protests against the University 
of California's investments in Sudan, 
whose government has been linked 
to genOCide in the Darfur region. In 
March, the UC regents voted to divest 
from several companies connected to 
business activities that provide revenue 
for the Sudanese government, a vote 
prompled in part by pressure from 
thousands of UC students. 

UCLA student and spokesperson 
for the UC divestment task force Baylee 
DeCastro said that what might deter 
students from being involved is the 
notion that they can make little change. 

"[Students) are debilitated by their 
skepticism," DeCastro said. "But we 
were able 10 paint a compelling picture 
of the problem:' 

Whal made their effort success-
ful, according to DeCastro, was elimi-
nating this skepticism and acquiring 
student reaction to the genOcide by 
prOviding a clear way to help solve the 
issue. A long-term vision - ending 
genocide in Darfur - was the source 
for motivating student reaction and 
using it toward activism. 

"We asked stu<fents. 'Doesn't that 
piss you off?' and channeled that 
response into action;' DeCastro said. 

She also said that simply having a 
conversation with other students about 
a topic is a form of activism. 

Within UC campuses across 
California however, the pool of those 
with a collective, activist spirit may 
be limited. 

"There's a small group of students 
who are SOcially aware ... but it's a small 
group," Deutsch said.

New LGBT Center Avoids Tired, Political Rhetoric 
• LGBI, from page 8 
taken a leaf out of Frank Lloyd Wright's 
book, with the accommodating form 
following the openness of its function. 

According to center Director Shaun 
Travers, the function of the space is 
simple - to "build community." He has 
directed the center since he was hired 
in 200 l, two years after its creation. 

"It is the largest LGBT center in any 
public institution. which makes me 
very happy!" Travers said. 

Like any institution. the center's 
mission runs the risk of dissolving into 
political rhetoric. It is one thing to say 
one is providing, as Travers said, "an 
open, diverse, welcoming Ispace) for 
all members of the university campus 
to discuss sexual orientation and gen-
der identity in;' and a completely dif-
ferent matter to actually provide it. 

When asked if he had a favorite 
success story. Travers laughed at the 
ceiling and said there were many. One 

story in particular, though, of a student 
who came out almost on his first day 
of coUese and is now going through 
Rainbow Graduation, remains a favor-
ite. His name is Rafael Colonna. 

ReveUe College senior Colonna 
had a bold Welcome Week his fresh-

m~ year, deciding to come out at the 
annual Q-Camp. 

"I had planned to come out," 
Colonna said. "Q-Camp was a first 
step:' 

Q-Camp is the yearly orientation 
event that acquaints students with the 
LGBT resources on campus and pro-
vides an inspirational potluck. 

"The potluck afterwards really 
helped me. Almost immediately it 
helped me get over some of the shit I 
had," Colonna said. 

More than just a place to hang 
out, the center provided Colonna with 
opportunities and activities to fill his 
time. He volunteered for FaIlFest. He 

got involved with Speaker's Bureau, an 
outreach program meant to educate the 
campus about LGBT issues. Colonna 
said his experience was "empowering~ 

Center leaders have set their sights 
on academic achievement. One long-
term goal is the creation of an LGBT 
minor, perhaps through the Critical 
Gender Studies program. 

But the center will also continue to 
face its biggest problem - freshman 
orientation. Due to the changing and 
dynamic population of this campus' 
future students, the largest issue the 
center handles is the constant educa-
tion of incoming freshmen . Despite 
its increase in square footage, the new 
building will be hard-pressed to keep 
up with its leadership. 

"We will continue to expand our 
academic connections to the campus," 
Travers said. "[And provide) connec· 
tions between the classroom, and the 
lived identity:' 

Budget Gives Separate Funding to Regular Events 
• BUDGET, from page 1 

"Even when I've graduated, there is 
still not going to [be) a tradition event 
at Sixth College that will be eligible for 
money," she said. 

In addition to the funding reduc· 
tions made to college councils, the lack 
of Sixth College-specific money in the 
"tradition events" pot will put the col· 
lege's organizations in a spot, Ly said. 

• "Although it may be a headache to 
some people. I liked having students 
come to each council to request money 
for their event," she said. "Each college 
has their own finance committee. so 
they should be able to go over each 
event and decide if It should get fund · 
ing from that college." 

While Khanna's budget puts fiscal 
pressure on coUege councils. it will sim-
plify college-specific funding requests 
that, for the most part, go to the A.S. 
Council anyway, according to Vice 

President Finance Conrad Ohashi . 
"I think what it really comes down 

to. tho~, is this: A.S. is extremely 
poor. while some coUeges are pretty 
self-sufficient," he stated in an e-mail 

While fonner Thurgood Marshall 
College Senior Senator Kate Pillon said 
she neither supported nor opposed 
Khanna's plan, she cautioned the coun· 
cil that major reforms to the budget 
would require close scrutiny. Pillon was 
a staunch supporter of college-council 
funding during her term as senator. 

"The switch from having student 
organizations go to coOege councils to 
the A .S. Council for funding needs to 
be made carefully:' she said. "People 
need to make sure that all the organi-
zations that would have gotten money 
from the colleges get the same from the 
council as a whole." 

In his latest drafts, Khanna also 
created several stipends for staff in 

" 

AS. Council offices. and re-established 
stipends for managers in A.S. services 
such as Student-Run Television. The 
inclusion of such stipends further 
shows Khanna's commitment to his 
own supporters, according to Watts, 
who prornUed to cut stipends during 
both of his unsuccessful campaigns for 
AS. president. 

"It's part of a culture of corruption," 
he said. "Those stipends don't benefit 
any students other than the ones that 
get it." 

Khanna contends that stipends are 
needed to attract strong leadership. 

"Why are all the other UC's A.S:S 
so influential and powerful?" he stated 
in an e-mail. "Because they take it seri-
ously. Because they pay their staff and 
their students like it's serious business."

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MAY 22, 2006 

GSA Wants to Opt Out of Possible Fee Hikes 
~ ATHLETICS, from page 1 
thinks that students should pay the $6 
to $8 per quarter for the scholarships 
because of increased demands on reg· 
istration -fee funding and because the 
program affects student life; accord· 
ing to Academic Senate Chair Jean· 
Bernard Minster. 

Although charging students for 
programs such as athletics is not 
uncommon, Edwards feels that the 

'switch is a step backward in an already 
delayed process. 

"In the [registration] fee proposal, 
you know the money is there; Edwards 
said. "It's done. It's hard money. That 
part is over with. My biggest concern 
is the uncertainty of the funds for the 
scholarships because now we have to 
wait and see how the votes play out 
versus if it were approved the way it 
were proposed, it's done and we<l move 
onto the next chapter:' 

A six-member task force spent the 
summer and fall of 2005 simplifying 
the proposal, ultimately eliminating 
a provision allOWing outside fund -
ing for individual teams - a. provi-
sion that faced opposition from the 
Council of Provosts. 

Aside from that, however, the 
committee had no hand in changing 
the funding mechanism, according 
to biology professor and task force 
member Stuart Brody. 

Instead, the main effort of the 
group was to unite competing ide-
als of faculty members in order to 
gain maximum support, Brody said. 
Rather than confronting the compH-
cated issue of social life, the context of 
the proposal was changed to simply 
comply with the NCAA Division-II 
requirement for athletic scholarships. 

"Every faculty member had their 
own opinion on how to improve stu-
dent morale and that was competing;' 
Brody said. 

On the Sidelines 
During intitial negotiations, the 

Graduate Student Association argued 
that graduate students .should not bear 
a higher fee burden, since they are not 
affected by intercollegiate athletics. 
Some administrators, on the other 
hand, believe otherwise. 

"[ think it's great that [grants· in. 
aid is] going tJuough the students 
because [they] should decide on 
what's going to impact the student 
environment," Edwards said, "But for 
the administration to put on the table 

to have it taken care of and then [for] 
faculty and graduate students to say, 
'Hey wait a minute, that should come 
from students taxing themselves' .. . 
J kind of question whether that's in 
their purview." 

Watson and Edwards said that 
allowing graduate students to be 
exempt from fee increases would set 
a bad precedent, because several ser-
vices funded by the registration fee 
- which graduate students must pay 
- are not used by all students, such 
as psychological counseling, career 
services and residence halls. 

"That whole rationale was very 
disturbing to me;' Edwards said. "Just 
the ability for anyone group to say, 
'I'm not going to pay for that because 
I don't use it: Why do you pick [ath· 
leticsl and say, '[ don't want to pay for 
that'? [ think that's very discrimina· 
tory toward athletics:' 

While the impact of GSAS oppo· 
sition to the proposal is uncertain, 
the fact that NCAA programs ben-

E~ faculty member 
had their own opinion 

on how to improve 
student morale and 
that was competing." 

- Professor Stuart Brody, 
Member, Athletic Scholarship 

Task Force 

efit undergrads more than graduate 
students influenced senate support 
for proposal revamps, according to 
the Senate's Graduate Council Chair 
Robert E. Continetti. 

Administrators are bracing for the 
worst case scenario next year, when 
students may reject funding scholar-
ships with larger fees and the NCAA 
refuses another temporary waiver. 

According to Edwards, the most 
immediate result of not meeting 
the Division· )( requirement would 
be probation, during which UCSD 
would not be eligible ttl compete in 
championships. This would pose even 
more challenges to the struggling 
department. 

"[Probation] is an enormous black 
eye for the campus; Brody said. "It 

_WEBCHAT 

would have huge ramifications in 
. terms of recruiting students here, 
even students who aren't athletes." 

The Wailins Game 
The real impact on the program, 

however, is proper funding for the 
department, according to Edwards. 
While scholarships will place UCSD 
at the level of other 0 · )( teams, most 
of the fee money will go toward the 
operating budget of the department. 

"If students vote against the 
increase in fees, which includes schol-
arships, we'll have to make some 
choices about how to run UCSD ath-
letics;' Edwards said. "We<l have to 
look at potentially eliminating some 
[athletic] opportunities either for 
both genders or one gender. We<l have 
to make some reductions~ 

Regardless of the reasons for 
the switch in the funding method, 
Watson embraces the referendum for 
its symbolism. . 

"Putting [grants-in.aid] in the 
hands of the students to decide is a 
wonderful -way of going, and then 
for the faculty to endorse the student 
position indicates a true partnership 
on the campus," Watson said. 

Decisions about the contents of the 
proposal and the method of funding 
have not yet been fmalized, according 
to Minster. 

"The Senate Council remains 
concerned about some aspects of the 
revised proposal, in particular the 
funding mechanism, but acknowledg-
es the positive aspects of the proposal 
for the campus." Minster stated in an 
e-mail. 

A vote on the proposal was slated 
for this weeJr, but was again delayed 
until June 8. Until then, communica-
tion will continue between members 
of the senate, administrators, faculty 
and the A.S. Council before it is pre-
sented to the faculty's Representative 
Assembly for discussion and voting.

and Choi passed him. Both run-
ners would reach home plate, and 
thanks to pure drunkenness on the 
Koa/Q side, the error went unno-
ticed and both runs were counted. 

ach. As I was doubled over, my 
Guardian teammates came to my 
aid and both teams erupted in a 
commotion in front of home plate. 
After the dust settled down, it was 
decided that a drink-off would fix 
the argument, and the Koala went 
on to win it and counted the cheap 
run. 

The game ended with the Koala 
on top, but bad blood and the 
thirst for revenge prompted some 
Guardian members to return to 
the field with fresh beer and the 
idea to start a new game. However, 
the second game did not last long, 
as the Koala took advantage of an 
unmotivated Guardian squad and 
cruised to a blowout. 

• LAX, from page 16 
"UCSB's prior experience in big 

tournaments gave them the edge in the 
match:' he said. 

The loss meant that UCSD would 
have no shot at the finals. but there 
were still consolation matches to be 
played and the Tritons forged on. 

The team may have been disap-
pointed in its first·round loss but 
it did not show in the next match 
against Northeastern University. 
UCSD pounded the competition and 
the match ended with a 16-7 rout. 

The Tritons started slowly in the 
first quarter, but gained momentum 
after some motivational words. 

·Once we got rolling, we couldn't 
be stopped," he said. 

McCall later filled up the stat 
sheet, scoring six goals and adding 
an assist. Dean was also able to get 
on track, scoring three goals and 
setting up his teammates nicely with 
four assists. 

Babineau said that the Tritons' 
play returned to its usual quality. 

"Once the team got comfortable. 
we played the type of aII·around game 
that we have all season:' he said. 

Northart had his second strong 
matCh in a row, scoring one goal and 
dishing out two assists. The solid 
win enabled the team to regain the 
confidence it had lost in the first 
match and looked to finish the tour· 
nament out strong in its final game 
against the University of Oregon. 

UCSD did playa solid match, but 
the Tritons were unable to overcome 
siI goals by Oregon attacker Julian 

Coffman and lost the match 9·7. 
The contest was close throughout, 
with the Tritons narrowing Oregon's 
lead to only two goals in the final 
quarter, but the Ducks played well 
defenSively and were able to hold on 
for the win. Carter turned in anoth-
er impressive performance. scoring 
two loais and one assist. 

Caner said that, similar to the 
earlier UC Santa Barbara game, the 
Tritons had difficulty In stopping 
the Duclu. A disappointed Babineau 
added that while the Tritons had 
been able to hold their own asainst 
athletic teams all year, Oregon ·just 
played a little better in the match. 
We had trouble coping with their 
athleticism and could not stop 
Coffman's big left· handed shot." 

With the score still close and 
the keg getting lighter, the game 
became heated as both benches 
cleared following a play at the 
plate. News writer Serena Renner 
wu behind the plate when a huge 
Koa/Q player rounded third and 
approached home plate without 
sliding. It appeared Renner tagged 
him out; however, like in the rest 
of the game, the Koa/Q team would 
not accept its fate and immediately 
began arguing. 

I came charging toward the 
Koala baserunner to argue the 
Guardian's side only to be met 
with a fierce sidekick to the stom-

A couple of innings later, the 
Koa/Q remained ahead by a slim 
margin thanJu to some huge hits 
from slugger Dirty Mike. Mike's 
hits kept the Koala on top and 
his drinking habits emptied the 
keg at a fut pace. By the time the 
Guardian ended the top half of the 
inning and was prepared to hit, 
the Koala team started using shady 
tactics to finish off the keg in order 
to officially end the game before 
the Guardian could get a chance to 
come back. 

While the Koa/Q can claim vic-
tories in both games, all partici· 
pants in the annual sloshball com· 
petition know what happened and 
that the Koala team needed to use 
some tricks of the trade to pull off 
the victory. 

Though-S'ome discrepancies are 
to be expected in any slosh ball 
game, we can only hope that next 
year's contest wilL provide a more 
level playing field and a deeper 
keg. 

The Tritons knew they could 
have performed better than the 1-2 
showing in the national champion-
ships, but they are stiD proud of 
their success this season.

Babineau attributed the produc-

tive seuon to the c1osene.. of the 
team. _ 

· We had a lot of team chemistry 
that allowed us to play very w~1I and 
have a lot of fun," he said. 

Carter said that he was optimis-
tic about next season and expects 
the Tritons to improve on this year's 
finish. 

·We are loinl to be young and 
will have to rebuild," he said. "But 
our experience this year will help 
tremendoualy." 

The Tritons finished the season 
with a record of 12·7.

rhythm before the match," she said. 
"[t's more based on your own ability 
and horsemanship because you just 
have to deal with what you get." . 

The competition process' two 
categories, Western and English, 
require different cadences and ways 
of holding the body. In English, 
riders wear UCSD solid-colored 
jacket uniforms, while in Western 
competition, attire consists of fun 
hats and frilly shirts. Within three 
skill levels are different classes 
known as flat - open·ground trot-
ting and cantering - and fences 
- jumping over fences ranging 
from 2 feet, 3 inches to 3 feet, 3 
inches tall. 

The first-place rider down to 
third place receives seven, five and 
four points, respectively, and each 
show has a "point rider:' which is 
chosen in secret by the coach, whose 

points count toward the overall 
team score. Each team must score 
35 points to qualify for the Zones 
Championship competition. 

This year, Western riders junior 
Lindsay Minor and senior Alicia 
Cunningham placed third, sopho· 
more Laura Erickson came in 
fourth, sophomore Monica Wolfe 
placed eighth and one English rider, 
Zaides, hit second at the Zones 
Championship. 

Zaides' subsequent trip to 
nationals represented the culmina· 
tion of the equestrian team's efforts. 
Zaides was the sole Triton rider. 
Knowing she would be facing stiff 
competition, Zaides doubled her 
efforts and endured a rigid training 
regimen . 

After arriving at the competition, 
Zaides was a bit awestruck by her 
surroundings, but was able to quell 
her fears. 

"All these riders had huge ban-
ners, elaborate outfits and lots of 
tUm members for their support, 
and I had my mom, brother and 
boyfriend," she said. "I started to 
get nervous, having never ridden in 
front of so many people before, [but] 
right before it all went away and I 
started tuning in." 

Zaides' focus prevailed with a 
sixth·place finish. well within her 
goal of placing in the top 10. Her 
story reverberated throughout the 
UCSD squad, which hopes that 
mare riders will follow in Zaides' 
footsteps. 

Following her whirlwind expe-
rience at nationals, Zaides offered 
some inspirational words to her 
comrades. 

"Now I know why I sacrificed all 
those Friday nights and put in all 
the work," she said. "[Nationals] was 
one of the best moments of my life."

lacrosse Falls to Galloping G uchos 

BILLY WON G/GUARDIAN 
The Tritons ' regular season win ouer UCLA in February helped earn them a NO. 7 seeding in the national championship tournament. 

B Brellt WestcoLL 
STAff WRITER 

The U SO men's club lacro e team 
looked to put the finishing touches on a 
strong season at the u.s. Intercollegiate 
Associates National Championship in 
Plano, Texas, May 9 through 11 . The 
Tritons were able to garner a No. 7 
seed in the Oivision-A bracket, which 
led them to a matchup with conference 
rival and two-time defending cham-
pion UC anta Barbara in the first 
round. The Tritons had already won 
two close games against the Gauchos, 
once in overtime during the regular 
eason and again in the first round of 

the conference playoffs. 

The focused Tritons had a lot of 
confidence heading into their first-
roUJld match, but they also knew that 
beating a quality team like the Gauchos 
three times in one season would be 
tough. Unfortunately, the Tritons could 
never get it together and fell 9-5 in 
a defensive struggle. Senior midfield-
er Brett Northart contributed three 
goals to the struggling Triton offense. 

econd-Team All We tern Collegiate 
Lacrosse League junior attacker Chris 
McCall helped lead the team with one 
goal and two assists. 

Junior midfielder Tim Carter said 
that adverse weather and UC Santa 
Barbara's strong defensive strategy 
contributed to the loss. 

"We are not a very deep team and 
the extreme heat in Texas got to u :' 
Carter said. " [Thel Gaucho' solid 
defense on AU-American and Western 
Collegiate Lacrosse League Offensive 
Player of the Year attacker ick Dean 
[was also a factor]:, 

The game was still close at the end 
of the first half with the Gauchos lead-
ing 4-3. However, UC Santa Barbara 
was able to clamp down defenSively 
and score five unanswered goals. 

Junior defenseman Jason Babineau 
was very disappointed with his team's 
loss, which he attributed to the 
Gaucho's history.

The UCSD equestrian team is 
definitely not your everyday squad, 
and most would agree that falling off, 
or being fallen on by a 1,500-pound 
horse, is greater than your average 
sport liability. This is a team of strength 
and endurance, not only physically, 
but also in the equestrians' ability to 
continue pursuing their love of horse 
showing despite many challenges. 

Yet in the midst of all its obstacles, 
the Tritons managed a fourth-place 
spot in the Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association's English regionals and 
second in the Western regionals. The 
team sent five riders to West Coast 
Zones Championships in Sacramento, 
Calif., and one to Pennsylvania for 
nationals, where the rider placed sixth 
out of the top 18 riders in the nation. 

Like many other club teams. rec-
ognition is always an issue for the 
equestrians. In fact, mo t students 
don't know that the team exists. 

"I don't think we are really recog-
nized as a sport:' junior English open 
rider Cindy Caron said. "I really think 
that most people think we're ju t a big 
joke:' 

Funding is also problematic. Riding 
lessons can cost $40 or more per ses-
sion, and the costs of caring for horses, 
uniforms and traveling fo r away tour-
naments are huge. In addition, loca lly 
hosted shows require hipping hor es 
from different schools and providing 
food, judges, announcers and pace 
- often adding up to more than the 
average college student can afford. 

The monetary aspect affect many 
other areas of the team, including 
the ability to maintain a coach. Since 
coaches erve on a voluntary ba i 
and are not paid for their instruction, 
the team ha been unable to keep a 
coach for more than a year, a ide from 
their current We tern- tyle coa h Gale

The UCSD equestrian team's impressive performances in the IHSA's English- and Western-
style regionals in early March earned itfourth and second place finishes, respectiuely. 
Willis, who has been with the team for 
two years and also runs her own train-
ing service. 

"The lack of an EngIish[-stylel 
coach this year was a. big deal, so the 
team had to come together to help 
each other out at shows:' this year's 
No. 6 nationals rider sophomore Sarah 
Zaides said. "More experienced girls 
went out of their way to help the new-
bies get on, polish boots and literally 
'coach' from the rail:' 

Also, unlike thei r top competitors 
UCLA and Cal Poly Pomona, which 
have access to horses and stables for 
everyday practices, the less financially 
fortunate UCSD team has a harder 
time arranging and paying for it prac-
tice time. The difficulty in setting up 
carpools and times to fit everyone's 
schedule to drive 25 minutes to the 
barns in Del Mar has made practices 
rare. While other schools have more 
school support, UCSO riders often 
take advantage of local trainer who 
offer les ons in exchange for work at 
their stables. 

Even with all these difficulties, the 
teanl refuses to give up on a deeply 
rooted passion. Caron first started rid-
ing at the age of five in France, and 
started competing in French horse 
shows when she was 10. 

"Coming from my European jump-
er background, 1 tend to control my 
horse through every movement and 
cut turns to go as fast as I can, when the 
point of IHSA horseshows i to look 
pretty and make it seem like riding 
horses is easy:' Caron said. "Because I 
can't ride the way I used to, it give me 
more will to compete.» 

One very different aspect of the 
IHSA competitions is "catch riding:' in 
which-the hosting region provides ran-
domly as igned horses to each rider. 

According to sophomore Laura 
Erick on, this luck-of-the-draw ele-
ment requires a great deal of trust 
between human and animal. 

"Watching your horse warm up is 
key in tryi ng to figure out the horse's
