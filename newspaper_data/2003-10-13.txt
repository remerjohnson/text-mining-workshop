Union strikes following talk breakdown Web site shuts down 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Contributing Writer 

Union representatives of 70,000 
grocery workers broke off contract 
talks for the second time and called a 
strike against Vons srores late on the 
night of OCl. 11 . 

The decision came after United 
Food and Commercial Workers' 
Union leader announced that negoti-
ations with grocery store chains 
Ralphs, Albert nand Vons failed to 
make measurable progress. 

The companies called the strike "a 
bad idea that inflicts economic hardship 
on employees of the companies and 
inconveniences the general public."

Representation by 
advocates in jeopardy 
A.S. opposes change to 
Student Conduct Code 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A. . ouncil adopted a res-
olution oppo ing a proposed 
change to UCSO's Student 
Conduct Code that would prevent 
students from being represented by 
an advocate at judicial hearing . 
The council pa sed the resolution 
by consensus at its Oct. 8 meeting. 

The key change in the code has 
deals wllh the difference between 
parti ipation of advocates and rep-
re entation by advocates. Under 
the proposed rule, advocate 
would be able to indirectly partici-
pate in all proceeding by erving a 
a re ource to the tudents, but such 
advocate would not be allowed to 
directly represent or speak on the 
behalf of the students. 

urrently the code allowed for 
nonattorncy repre emati n. BUI a 

review of the code by the uc 
Office of the General Council con-
cluded that the code could not dif-
ferentiate between attorneys' and 
nonattorneys' ability to represent 
students at hearings. 

ichola Aguilar, director of 
Student Policies and Judicial 
Affair, pro po ed to eliminate rep-
re entation altogether in an effort 
to comply with the request from 
the eneral ouncil. 

"I made the deci ion ... because 
the restriction on attorneys repre-
enring students had already been 

in place for at least two year or 
three years before the current revi-
sion," Aguil r aid. "I am very con-
fident that thi acti n wa in no way 

rbitrary or capricious and in fact 
doe not in any ignificant way 
deprive the student of effective

such as how it can sometimes be a 
very spread-ollt and anti-social 
camplls because peoplc don 't see 
each other or cross paths," Gurdin 
said. "The Web site's purpose is to 
try to improve UCSD by creating a 
venue wherc people can communi-
cate, connect and form a commu-
nity; where you can ~press your-
self, learn more and bc more 
involved with the campus." 

According to the creators of the 
site, they initially informed the 
administration about their idca and 
received no word of any potential 
wrongdoing. 

· Wc kept the administration 
up-to-date in advance of launching 
our site - in advance of us making 
all thc advertisement materials and 
in advance of us working so hard 
on our brand name and getting the 
word out," Gurdin said. 

Flyers advertising the site were 
displayed throughout campus 
beginning z.ero week. 

According to the California 
Education Code Section 9200, no 
srudent organization or business can 
use the name "University of 
California" without permission 
from the UC Board of Regents. The 
name " niver ity of California" is 
therefore owned by the state and no 
person can usc it or its abbreviation 
[Q indicate affiliation [Q organiza-
tions. The code also prohibits the 
use of the name for designation of 
ocial, political, religious and busi-

ness groups. Likewise, the namc 
cannot be used for advertisement 
and promotional purpose . 

Violation of this code counrs as 
a mi demeanor in California. 

"It's kind of heavy-handed," 
Gurdin said. "If you look at the 

California Education Code Section 
9200, it says that no srudent orga-
nization has the right to go out and 
use thc UCSD name as they please, 
which means they're ba ically dis-
enfranchising studcnts from identi-
fying with their universiry." 

The director of Studcnt 
Policies and Judicial Affairs, 

icholas Aguilar, spoke to Gurdin 
on Sept. 26 informing him of the 
code and asked him to remove the 
UCSD initials from the Web site 
and Web address unless he could 
present written authorization from 
the Board of Regents for pennis-

" They're basically

sion. However, when the Web site 
remained unchanged and posters 
were still seen on campus, the site's 
creators were asked in a final notice 
to discontinue its u e of the namc. 

According to Aguilar, the 
Education Code allows for the use 
of the university'S name if written 
permission is obtained from thc 
UC Regents, and that the codc's 
wording anticipates that permis-
sion could be obtained through a 
negation process. 

According to the notice sent by 
guilar, the si te designers' fai lure 

to comply with hi prior request to 
stop the use of the UCS D initials 

in the site name and on advertise-
ments around campus is also a vio-
lation according to the UCSD 
Srudent Conduct Code that could 
result in disciplinary action. 

Although Aguilar is not allowed 
to talk about any specific cases of 
violations that are sti ll in discussion, 
he explained that the code is applied 
to students and nonstudents alike. 

"It 's for anybody and every-
body," Aguilar said. "No one is 
allowed to use the name for com-
mercial purposes. ~ 

Even though the site does not 
generate any profits at present time, 
Gurdin and Mahavuthivanij were 
hoping to eventually become a 
media organization that would gen-
erate revenue through advertise-
ments. 

"We've put in time and energy 
to this site," Mahavuthivanij said. 
"It's mainly a service for students 
and profit is secondary to that." 

According to Mahavuthivanij, 
he has received numerous respons-
es from Web site users. 

"The Web site [http://ucsduncm-
sond.com) is one of few good ways 
for students to have the opportuni-
ty to know more about other sru-
dents and the activities that this 
school offers," said a registered user 
for the Web site, a Warren senior 
registered as "Sonix.» 

Gurdin and Mahavuthivanij 
havc consulted with Student Legal 
Services and are seeking legal 
advice from various sources. 

"Right now we're trying to talk 
to peoplc who havc licensing 
authority to grant some kind of per-
mission," Gurdin said. "Hopefully, 
our first option is to keep our name 
becausc we spent 0 much time, 
effort and money on it."

Student fees at the University of California 
rose 30 percent this year beca use of an eco-
nomic cnSIS under the watch of outgoing Gov. 
Gray DaVl . With state businesses leaving at 
an alarming rate, an energy debacle and a cor-
rupt governor with overall incompetence, VOt-
ers had seen enough Gray. And as Arnold 
chwarz.enegger emerged as the clear winner 

10 this historic recall, California's ousting of 
Davi is not only good for the state, but good 
for UC students as well. 

UC needs a fiscally responsible executive 
who IS willing to curb spending, ensuring 
funds mtended for UC will not be used to 
bankroll the mulotude of wasteful California 
programs; this year's fee hike need not repeat 
IIscif in the future. Of courn!, the budget crisis 
cannot be solved by more taxation - spending 
more to meet the demands of more spending 
IS utterly insane. There mUSt be fiscal restraint, 
which Arnold has said he will bring to 
acramcnto. Furthermore, his ardent support 

of educaoon lends credence to the belief that 
he will act in the interest of UC, not to men-
Don do what's In his power to reign m wayward 
California ICgJslaove spending that brought 
about the fee Increases In the first place. 

It' aboutume a Republacan assumed the 
governor~hlp of California to clean house. 

Arnold intends to do so, but what made rum 
the winning Republican last Tue day' 

There was another fiscally responsible 
conservative on the ballot, State en. Tom 
McClmtock, and Republicans largely pa cd 
him by for the more socially liberal 
Terminator. But even though Arnold easily 
won, should 
McClintock have 
stepped aside prior to 
last week's election?

that could actually win the election and gov-

Shouting buzzwords 
proves nothing 

Loud activists substitute 
propaganda for reason 

Returned 
yank 

Chris Taylor 

Americans are loud, no twO ways about it. It's not that we are necessatily obnox-
ious, though that is often the case. 
No, it is mostly just our basic deci-
bel level. Normal American con-
versations bellow and reverberate 
over conversations of other 
nations' citizens in any public 
place, so that everyone can hear the 
details. 

There is a saying in Ireland that 
you can always hear an American 
before you see him. There is some-
thing to be said for being very loud, 
though. The squeaky wheel always 
gets the oil, as the adage says. The 
louder you are, the more people 
listen to you, whether they want to 
or not. Political groups have picked 
up on this very well. If something is 
shouted long enough, people will 
innately begin to believe it. 

UCS D is no exception to this 
rule. In fact, most political groups 
on campus have but one strategy: 
yell as loudly as possible, insulting 
anyone wh o disagrees with them 
along the way. Walk by any protest 
or politica l student organization 
table on Library Walk and this 

becomes more than apparenr. 
Now, if thiS form of indoctrina-

tion works for a certain political 
group anJ if people are stupid 
enough to buy it, then one CJn only 
congratulate them nn pl<lying poli-
tics well . There is nothing Innately 
wrong with yelling at people to 
convince them of something; how-
ever, it does point to a larger prob-
lem that prevails at UCSD, as well 
as most other universities. 

Universities are supposed to be 
a haven for the intelligent and the 
search ~ r enlightenment. Students 
generally fail to uphold these stan-
dards in terms of expression of 
opinion. Perhaps this is why they 
are till students . One would hope, 
however, they have been accepted 
at UCSD with a pre -existing 
notion of reason. For a place of 
such vast resources and oceans of 
ideas and OPllllOns, the arguments 
that students use tend to come 
down to a few basic insults. 

Mo t politically active students 
resort to a few simple and overused 
attacks for everyone that disagrees 
with them. Here are just a few that 
prevail at UCSD: if YOll are 
opposed to affirmati ve action, 
you're called a racist. If you con-
demn suicide bombil.gs, you're 
called a Zionist apartheid support-
er. If you don't support

most Insignificant difference in 
opinion with an o nslaught of 
II1sults, ranging from imple one-
word snaps, to saying that their 
specific opponent doesn't deserve 
the same freedoms that everyone 
else has. 

\Vlrile most srudent organiza-
tions are more or less careful not 
to be directly responsible for these 
childish insults, the desire to use 
them still permeates the individu-
als in these organizations. A 
notable exception to this rule, of 
course, is the absurd outburst of 
attacks at the A.S. election results 
meeting in spri ng 2002 . 
Unfortunately, sll1ce it was 
Students First! that was responsi-
ble, all the politically active stu-
cjent clubs involved with this 
movement had a lot of answering 
ro do. 

There is an old saying: if your 
opponents resort to threats and 

insults, their argument hu. 
already failed . However, Il does-
n't seem likely that these politi -
cally aware groups are so igno-

resort I insulting. It' more prob-
able that these students have 
merely succumbed to the intense 
anger and hatred that accompa-
Illes ~rolonged yelling and 
protestlng. 

It i n't news that college stu-
dents are an angry bunch . It 
makes sen e actually, because 
when a student let politics satu-
rate their existence, the emotion 
can be overwhelming. I take that 
one from experience. 

Furthermore, if the same stu-
dent then engages in chanting, 
protesting and yelling as forms of 
propaganda, there is even less 
restraint of emotion, and civil 
debate is Hushed down the toilet. 
Even so, there is nothing wrong 
with this anger, except that it's 
extremely hypocritical on a col-
lege campus that is supposed to 
uphold reason and intelligence. 
Such reason would suggest that 
both sides of any issue should be 
weighed before making an educat-
ed decision. This research will 
almost always place the student in 
a state of mind that would not 
require such outbursts. 

Clearly, this is not what regu-
larly occurs on campus. And,

The key he re is that the 
Muslim students are pretending 
to be so concerned about how 
they are portrayed by a joke news-
paper, but they don't con ider 
how their olVn actions reflect 
upon them. 

They have nor helped bring 
criminal element within their 
community to justice. They think 
so little of themselves that they 
view the Koala as a real problem 
and then wonder why they can't 
even stop us. 

It's because they already 
defeated themselves by trying to 
fight something as insignificant as 
a college newspaper. I hope that 
someday they will try to combat 
the real problems. T hat will be 
the day they become productive 
members of our community.

UC orders review of admissions 
Article sparks criticism of UC Berkeley 

By KIM-MAl CULTER 
Daily Californian (U. California-

Berkeley) 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. 

- Deflecting criticism that UC 
Berkeley unfairly admitted hun-
dreds of "marginally qualified" stu-
dents, the University of California 
ordered a systemwide review of its 
new admission policies. 

Although it is unclear what the 
study will cover, it may delve into 
how factors such as race, ethnicity, 
ocioeconomic status and g rade 

point average played out in admis-
sions decisions - topics only 
briefly touched upon in a prelimi-
nary report critical of the UC 
Berkeley admissions policy. 

ommissioned by UC Board 
of Regents Chairman John 
Mo res, the report revealed that 
UC Berkeley accepted 378 stu-
dents with SAT J scores less than 
1000 while turning away hundreds 
more with near-perfect SAT I 

number~. 
U Berkeley Chancellor 

Robert Berdahl blasted coverage 
of the report by the Los Angeles 

Times, writing in a letter to UC 
President Robert C. Dynes that 
the newspaper failed to include 
"essential contextual informa-
tion . 

"While applicants with higher 
test scores are much more likely 
to be admitted than those lVith 
lower test scores, a sma ll number 
with lower scores will be admit-
ted," Berdahl wrote. "This out-
come is not unusual - it is true 
on all UC ca mpuses and at all 
selective institutions across the 
country." 

UC Berkeley officials said a 
va riety of factOrs led to the high-
scoring applicants' rejections. 
More than a quarter withdrew their 
a pplica tions, another third were 
out-of-state students and another 
sizable portion were international 
students or applicants to highly 
competitive engineering majors, 
sa id Richard Black, assistant vice 
chancellor of admissions and 
enrollment. 

The remaining high-scorers -
fewer than ISO students - had a 
lower GPA on average than the 
low-scoring admits, he said. 

"It seems surprising to me that 
people are 0 concerned about 378 
out of more than 10,000 cases -
such a small percentage," Black 
said. 

Berdahl also wrote that not one 
of the admits has left because of 
academic deficiency. 

Still the study has renewed con-
cerns that the comprehensive 
review admissions policy is a poten-
tial backdoor to boost underrepre-
sented student enrollment. 

Out of 378 low-scoring admits, 
238 were underrepresen ted 
minorities. 

A heavy critic of comprehensive 
review and an advocate against 
affirmative action, UC Regent 
Ward Connerly called the study a 
"damning report." 

Put in place after the affirma-
tive action ban, comprehensive 
review takes a holistic look at an 
applicant, taking into considera-
tion personal background along 
with primary academic factors. 
Some 58 numerical dara points 
about test core, cour es and 
background funnel into an admis-
sions decision. 

Power: Author asks for student involvement 
contilllied from page 2 

During her addre , Powers 
recoun ted her own experiences as a 
\Vashingron intern and a freelance 
war correspondent in Yugoslavia 
and eventually executive director of 
the Carr In titute for Iluman 
Rights Policy at Ilarvard University. 

he closed her speech with a plea to 
suldents to have confidence in their 
abilities to make a difference. 

" Don't let your understanding of 
what is possible or reali tic interfere 
with your understa nding of what's 
deslra ble," Powers sa id. " Be, I sup-
po;e, unrca onable. econdly, d n 't 
underestimatc what you have to 
offer. \\'ith the values that brought 
you to CSD, the thinking and 
wriung skills they teach you here, 
you will be equipped to do good." 

ixth College freshman Ru sell 
Peavy, who attended both the con-

vocation and the dinner, said he was 
inspired by her speech. 

"Listening and learning to what 
she sa id about her own experiences, 
I can look ahead in mine and real-
ize that with ju t some faint notion, 
you can achieve whatever you 
wam, be it human rights or world 
domination," he said. 

Getting Power to speak was not 
an easy task. 

.. A massive alllount of work 
(went into putting on this speechl," 
Goodwin said. "There 's been a 
grand opening committee si nce 
early last yea r involving people 
from all over the university. A 
whole bunch of people, a whole 
bunch of work." 

Roosevelt Provost Ann Craig 
described the impact of having 
Power as a speaker. 

"vVc wanted someone with 

whom students could relate , and 
we wanted someone who cou ld 
speak in an engaging manner to an 
audience largely of students , and 
we wanted someone who would 
speak about a topic that reflected 
some of the issues in the world 
today that our n1dents need to be 
thinking about," Craig sa id. 

Power's peech, which was orig-
inally only going to be the convo-
cation for Eleanor Roo evelt 
College, wa part of a larger initia-
tive to rai e student awareness 
regarding global issues. 

"The college provosts are trying 
to create convocations to bring stu-
dents and faculty and community 
tOgether to talk about issues of 
social, political and cultural signifi-
cance," Craig aid . "It's hard to find 
one that's more important than the 
role of the U .. in the world tOday." 

Architect: Sadfie explains building designs 
conrmued from page I 

public pace in COmlllunllies 
throughout history, eventually 
moving to explain how his exten-
sive list of design fit intO an 
"architecture of interaction." 

"The history of urbanism is the 
evolving form of community," 
Safdie aid. "Within building 
types, there are spaces for interac-
tion, which define a building." 

afdie listed the overwhelming 
use of cars, a change in ~ca l e -
meani ng skyscrapers and high-rise 
buildings - and the tendency for 
trip malls to erve as places of 

interaction over librarie or city 
plaza a what has influenced major 
shifts in architecture over the past 
cennlry. The problem for archi-
tects , then, according to Safdie, is 
to "expl re how to craft places 
where people feel good interacting 
with one another." 

afdie's extensive experience is 
hugely centered in universities and 
Iibranes. During the lecturc, he 
covered hiS w rk on ommullity 
57 In lontrcal, a planned City th,1I 
ha\ been the most successful In 
Canada a~ far as rctnllllng reSidents.

Di tn t til Jerusalem and the con-
truCIlon of II cbrew nlOn 
.ollege in Jeru alcm, the Salt Lake 

City Library and the Pcrfonntng 
Arts Center in Kan as ity, Mo. 

Considering universities in par-
ticular, Safdle spoke of the specific 
aims architects have when planning 
a facility for education, noting that 
it required understanding build-
ings as "program spaces, and with-
in them the life of university Stu-
dents can carry on." 

Referring specifically 10 
Hebrew Union College, Safdie 
mentioned the "incorporation of 
landscape and architecture ... which 
was also a concern in San Diego." 

peaking on specific preoccupa-
tions and stra tegie regarding con-
struction on ER ' new campus, 

afdie said that "ER was a place, a 
community, that wanted to pre ent 
itself within another community." 

Preservi ng an individual atmos-
phere within a larger space with its 
own identity was a key concern for 
Safdie, who said that the six-college 
system required an architect to 
"take various facilities and plug 
them into the main public paths .. . 
to ustain and develop tudent life." 

afdie con luded by dl cussll1g 
over-arclung themes f architecture. 

"Value of arehlte ture do nOt 
change, regardless of changes 111

Code: Advocates would no 
longer speak for students 
contin ued from page I 

assistance of counsel, attorney or 
nonattorney. " 

AS. Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeffrey Boyd sees the 
attempt to end representation as an 
attack on student rights. 

"This i JUSt one more option 
for the students to have and this is 
one more option I think that the 
university is trying to crack down 
on," Boyd said. "They're limiting 
the options that you have available 
as a student when you go into a for-
mal hearing." 

Under the current code, stu-
dents can be as isted by attorney 
and nonattorney advocates, but 
only nonarrorneys may directly 
represent students and speak on 
their behalf at hearings. 

Among many points, the resolu-
tion adopted by the A.S. Council 
takes issue with the fact tha t the 
Student Regulations Revisions 
Committee, which convened in fall 
2002 to comment on the conduct 
code overhaul and includes 10 stu-
dent members, had no input on the 
proposed change. 

According to Aguilar, recom-
mendations made by the Office of 
the General Council, which ensure 
compliance with the law and uni-
versity policy, are usually imple-
mented without input from Stu-
dents or faculty. 

"The vice chan-

Code very well ," Boyd said . 
Silva agreed. 
"Not every student at thi 

school is able to present themselves 
as eloquently and zealously a pos-
sible in the contexl of university 
disciplinary action," ilva stated. 
"The goal here is to allow sttldents 
to have an advocate, not necessari-
ly a lawyer, but just someone who 
they can ask to defend them in case 
they're accused of something." 

The resolution also points out 
tl,at UCLA and VC Berkeley both 
allow representation at hearings . 

"Some of the schools tlla t we're 
trying to be better than, i.e. CLA 
and Berkeley, both allow for Stu-
dent advocate and student attor-
ney representation ," Boyd said. 
"And that's omething I think that 
our policies are not being consIs-
tent with ." 

Conversely, the UCSD admin-
istration proposed the p li cy as 
being "very much in the main-
stream of colleges and universities, 
particularly within the UC system, 
of not having attorneys or other 
advocates actually repre ent stu-
dents." 

Aguilar believes the tonc of 
judicial hearing will also be 
severely affected by the end of all 
represemation. 

"In terms of the formal hearing, 
what motivated the change was the 

fact that having 
cellor [of student 
affairs] actually 
took the extraordi-
nary step of inform-
ing the A.S. and 
Graduate tudent 
Association of these 
changes because he 
wanted to give the 
student govern-
ment the opportu-
nity to provide him 
additional com-
ment," Agudar said. 
"Bul this is an 

" 

third parties rep-
resent the accu ed 
... actually was 
creating a com-
munications barri-
er, was ca using 
unnecessary 
dclays in terms of 
chedultng, raising 

the level of the 
hearing process ... 
to the milch more 
fornul and Icgall'-

I t's important to 
remember that 

people are unjustb 
accused sometimes, " 
- Travis Silva, Thurgood 
Marshall College Cl1air 

extraordmary step that is not 
required 111 the procc s of reviSing 
tudent regulations." 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Chair Travis Ilva, co-author of the 
A.S. Council resoluuon, hopes that 
the student "oice WIll be heard. 

"We're loolung forward to 
working with Vice Chancellor [of 
Student Affair Joseph w.] Watson 
to make sure that student input is 
incorporated into this decision," 
Silva said. 

The AS resolution cites the 
U.S. Constitution's guarantee that 
"the accused shall enjoy the right ... 
to have the assistllnce of counsel for 
his defense" as reason to allow tu-
dent representation. 

However, Aguilar aid that this 
did nOt apply, 

"[The resolution] fails to point 
out that the Constitutional right 
to counsel is limited to indiVidual 
subject to criminal prosecution 
and does not apply to lawsuits 
brought in civil courts or before 
admini trative law procedures, 
such as UCSD's procedures for 
processing complaints of alleged 
violation of the university'. sUldent 
conduct regulations," Aguilar aid . 

Aguilar objects to other clauses 
of the resolution as welL 

"The resolution i misleading in 
that it implies that the revisions 
elimiOJlted the ability of students to 
have an advocate assist lhem," 
Aguilar said, "'nle advocate can 
actually accompany the student to 
all the meeting, and participate 
throughout, from the informal 
hearing up throu ,h the formal hear-
ing and even through the appeal ." 

Boyd womes that imple partlc-
'paLJon of an advocate Will not be 
ufficient to en ure an adequale 

defen e f the accu)ed, 
"I think 3 tudell who' hv and 

qUiet I~ not gUing to be Jt the '~allle

the law or poltcy require b) way of 
the procedures and procedural due 
proces that IS to be afforded to Stu-
dents invoh'ed in alleged miscon-
duct," Agtnlar said. 

Boyd, un the other hand , 
believes that having an advocate 
represent accu ed tudents level 
the playing field in the hearing and 
ensures that the university docs not 
have a built-in advantage. 

"If you don't know tile nldent 
Conduct ode, the university can 
walk all over you in the formal 
hearing. I've seen. it happen 
before," Boyd aid. "If you don't 
have an advocate there who's able to 
direccly intervene on your behalf, 
you're at a big loss wtth trying ro 
keep the univer ity playing by the 
rules. ThaIS just the way they oper-
ate." 

The new Student onduct 
ode must have ule approval of 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affm 
Joseph W. ""atson and Acting 
Chancellor Marsha , Chandler 
before taking effect. While Aguilar 
hopes approval might come in the 
nexl week, the A.S. re olutlon 
states that "the Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs ought to indefi-
nitely po tponc implementation of 
the proposed changc to the 
Student Conduct Code in an effort 
to gather further stude III input." 

"The be t - hot scenario 1 would 
like to cc happen is ju l to sec all 
representation allowed," Boyd aid. 
"r think that would be great."

changes, If approved, would not be

Strike: Picketers form lines in front of local Vans, Albertsons, Ralphs 
cominued from page I 

sumers. They targeted Vons because the 
company operated the most srores in 
Southern California . 

The companies said that a strike against 
Vons constituted a strike against all three, 
and promised that both Albertsons and 
Ralphs would lock out employees in what 
they called a "defensive move." 

"We realize that this economy is not the 
greatest and that we have to compete with 
Wal-Mart, but these drastic measures we just 
can't handle," said deli clerk Jennifer Marsh, 
who led the str iking workers at the Von 
store on Regents Drive, 

Early on Oct. 12 , she said the workers were 
not seeing much support from customers. 

"I have not seen a single cu tomer support 
us," Marsh said. "I t's really frustrating, 
because these are the same customers that we 
help and we see every single day. And if 
they're e1Cpecting the same kind of food on 
the shelves and the same kind of customer 
service, they're going ro be disappointed." 

In the afternoon of Oct. 2, picketers in 
front of Ralphs at the LaJolla Village Square 
were discouraging shoppers to cross the pick-
et line to enter the store and encouraging 
passing cars to honk in uppOrt of their cause. 

"I think a lot of people are listening to us 
and going to other stores," said picketer and 
part-time Ralphs casl)ier Heather Rou . 
"People aren 't going to come in as much, and 
(hat will help us." 

Picket captain Rita Ramon, also a pan-
rime Ralphs employee, agrecd. 

"I t's going well here, better than at the 
other stores," Ramon said. "We're clo e to 
our customers. More than anyone knows." 

At approximately 4:30 p.m" the picketers 
stood in front of the entrance to Ralphs deliv-
ery zone in an attempt to keep a Ralphs truck 
from entering. The truck, before getting to 
the loading zone, turned sharply in from the 
meet and hit the side of a La Jolla Village 
Square cu tomer's issan XTerra. 

While picketers speculated the driver was a 
temporary employee, store managers refused 
to comment. 

ome UC D students decided not to 
cross the picket line. 

Words for Joy De La Cruz 

"r refused to cross it, and 1 support the 
union" said Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Daphne Eanash, who herself is part of 
a union for employees of the City of 
Oakland. "I tried to find a place that doesn't 
have a picket line, but they pretty much all 
do, so I ended up going to Henry's." 

Other students went on with shopping as 
usual. 

") have to say I sympath.ized, but at the 
same time it was nice in there, it was emptier 
than I've ever seen it and the lines were 
shorr," said Revelle College junior Kyle 
Witt, who crossed the picket line at Ralphs. 
"I went to the side where there were the least 
amount of picketers, and 1 said 'I have to eat,' 
and they screamed back 'Trader Joe's.' But 

" I think a lot of people are listening to us and going 
to other stores , "

part-time Ralphs cashier 

tempted as ) am to go to Trader Joe's, I'm a 
Ralphs Club shopper." 

Negotiations came to a standstill on Oct. 5, 
after the union's old con met expired and union 
representatives called off further discussion, ask-
ing for a soike vote from members. 

The union returned to the negotiating 
table for a second round of talks with the 
grocers and federal mediators on Oct. 8, the 
same day that 97.4 percent of members from 
seven Southern California union locals voted 
to reject the companies' proposal and autho-
rize a strike. 

Only 65 out of more than 8,000 voting 
members from San Diego's Local 135 voted 
for the contract, totaling a 99 .1 percent sup-
port for a strike, according to the union. 

At issue were plans by the groce!}' chains 
to cut pension and a ttempts to cap wages for 
new employees almost three dollars below

. The latest proposal also asked employees 

to shell out $260 yearly for individual health 
coverage and up to $780 for family plans, 
which was the first time store asked workers 
to pay premiums for their health benefits. 

The chains said they needed cuts to offset 
increasing costs of healthcare and competition 
from nonunion discount chains like Wal-Mart. 

"Our proposal fairly and reasonably 
addresses two important business realities," 
said Ralphs President John Burgon in a state-
ment. "Health care and pension costs are 
skyrocketing and the competitive landscape 
has changed in Southern California." 

According to a Los Angeles-based union 
hotline, the companies "are still se t on shift-
ing a billion dollars in health care costs onto 
members and their families , representing a 
50 percent cut in benefits," 

Vons President Tom Keller issued a press 
release just before midn,ight on Oct. 11 . 

"We put forward a very good offer last 
weekend that the union leadership rejected 
out of hand," Keller stated. "Since then the 
unions have misrepresented our offer, and 
appear to be determined to follow a strike 
path that holds no upside for our people." 

Despite promises by the bakers' and 
Teamster ' unions to honor UFCWs picket 
lines, all three companies said they had plans 
underway to keep stores open. 

However, signs at the usually around-the-
clock Ralphs at La Jolla Village Square said the 
store would not open until 9 a.m. on Oct 12. 

Ralphs produce clerk Anna Phillips, who 
found out about the strike that morning, 
arrived at the store shortly before a.m. to 
find the doors locked. 

"My employers locked me and all of the 
union workers out. All of these people over 
here are probably the scabs, who have come 
to work," said Phillips, motioning to a group

YOU ALWAYS WROTE 
peace.love.joy 

Peace loved joy 
Joy loved hope 

and Peace owes 
You its hand in marriage 
& a carriage to heaven 

I SPEAK my p,ece 
in peaceful pieces 

full of pieces of Joy 
like confetti in the soul 

SHOULD WE be partying? 
I am sure you are 
Should we be parting? 
Dancing away? 
Walking away? 
You say stay 
in that balmy calm 
That was your voice 
'Enjoy the Joy' 

YOU always asked if 
you could be my recess-princess 

[a line from one of your favorite poems of mine] 
I say yes 

Now play in the kingdom 
where grown kids come 

to enOoy) palaces of their dreams 
I will see you there someday 
We will hold hands and play 

Today I will write ... you will play 
and see me in another tomorrow 

LOVERS OF WORD, sister-friend 
I owe kil586 to your forehead 
must return joy you gave 
I WIll fly them to heaven 
in the care of angell

The best on-campus picks that meal points can buy 

U cst) students have tllC privi-lege of enjoying larbucks' freshly-brewed coffee between 
classes, while studying on campus lale at 
night or whenever they wam. t Earl 's 
Place, locaLed in Earl Warren allege, 
srudents have easy acce to coffee from 
9:30 a.m. to I a.m. on weekday and 
from 3 p.m. to I a.m. on weekends. 

T he coffee corner in Earl 's Place 
erves many coffee drinks such as lan es, 

cappuccinos, mochas, mocha biancas, 
milk')' ways and the popular cara mel 
m3cchialO. Every coffee drink that i 
served hot can also be served cold upon 
request. For many students, the best 
part i that all drink can be purchased 
with meal points, and prices range from 
85 cents for a slllall regular coffee to 

4.25 for a large mocha bianca. Most 
students appreciate that E'lrI 's Place 
serves fresh coffee fo, ' meal points. 

"Other places that use meal I oint 
mainly serve regular coffee o r the bot-
tled frappucino ," Thurgood Mar hall 

allege sopholllore auren Ru el 
said. " I like to drink espresso ." 

Earl's Place serves coffee in three 

sizes and offers customer a va riety o f 
syrup hot cho ices that range from 
va nilla and raspberry to cherry and 
coconut. The most common I 
ordered coffee drink is lhe caramel 
macchiato , ; arl 's wo rkers say, but 
during finals some tudellt appreciate 
the "Hammerhead ," which i a hot o f 
espresso fill ed to the tOp with regular 
coffee. 

" I remember coming into Earl ' 
during midtenns and fin al ," \\'arren 
junior Sandy Isaacson said . "You can 
always count on Earl 's to be open. [ 
just rea lly enj y the coffec." 

The staff member at Earl ' Place 
recomlllend the mocha bianc l, a white 
choc late mocha , to weet coffee lovers 
and regular coffee with a shot of mint 
or hazelnut for otller coffee addict5. 

"I love that [the coffee at Earl's] 
wakes me up," V\'arrcn junio r Danielle 
Beck-Ellsworth sa id. " It's accessible 
and the people are friend ly. T he din-
ing halls only have the pump coffee 
and Ea rl 's uses yrups in tead of a 
powder mix. And it's cheape r than cof-
fee shop off-ca mpus."

" I lived in Ma rshall my freshman

Best breakfast 

By VINEESHA MALKANI 
Contributing Writer 

What could po ibly be better 
than a good breakfast in the morn-
ing? The only answer to this ques-
tion is breakfast at night, of 
cour e! 'Vith Ocean View Terrace 
open Wltil I a.m., students can 
devour the best breakfast on cam-
pus even right before bed. 

Whether you choose to have 
that mo t important meal of the 
day as your first or your last meal, 
OW is sure to fill you up with 
more than just ccreal and 
bagels. While the line at the grill 
can get ndiculously long at times, 
you'll probably find the extra 
time useful to decide which of 
their breakfast creations to 
or{}er. 

,~ .. 

For Earl Warren College 
sophomore Daniel Mejia, the 
wait is well worth it. 

"I find it hard to eat good 
breakfast on campus. Although 1 
live in Warren, 1 walk all the way 
to ovr so I can enjoy their 
unique breakfast burrito and 
Bobcat Sandwich," Mejia said. 

Almo t every po ible break-
fast food you can think of is 
served at OW, from pancake to 
their huge breakfast burritos 
stuffed with anything the taste 
buds desire. Bean , hash browns, 
salsa, egg, cheese, an array of 
colorful veggies and, of course, 
the all-important bacon, ausage 
and ham are available to choose 
from as a meat option. 

"A lot of people order break-
fast burritos and those are frus-

The Graduate School of 

trating because they take the 
most prep and I burn myself a 
lot," said Anthony Chen, ovr 
employee. 

However, if you're looking for 
something a little less filling, 
there are the popular Bobcat and 
Wave sandwiches, consisting of 
eggs, meat and cheese on either 
sourdough or a croissant. 

And for those days that you 
miss Mom's morning treats, you 
can order the French toast,

tained salad bar. 

Salad lovers and anyone who 
enjoys a fresh and nourishing 
salad with their meal can please 
their taste buds and boost their 
nutritional intake at Canyon 
Vista's lush salad bar. 

Manager Chris Nelson gives 
credit to the lead staff member of 
cold production, Mary Williams, 
for her dedication to keeping the 
salad bar fresh and clean. 

"Mary Williams is the onc 
that runs the salad bar and 
that's pretty much why it is so 
great. She has high standards 
and provides great training to 
her helpers [whol in turn, also 
have great standard," Nelson 
said. 

Located in Earl Warren 
College, Canyon Vista offers a 
wide variety of vegetables, fruit 
and salad specials. It is not 
uncommon to discover plump 
cherry tomatoes, fresh ro.naine 
and iceberg lettuce, sweet can-
taloupe, honey dew, red grapes 
and much more on a typical 
day. 

"We are very careful about 
providing a good selection of 
healthy and quality foods ," said 
Jane Qin, a Canyon Vista 
employee and third year student 
at Eleanor Roosevelt College. 
"We al 0 are open to requests 
from the students who eat at 
Canyon Vista and are always 
willing to take such requests into 
consideration." 

Williams trains her assis-
tants, showing them the beSt 
way to cut the different vegeta-
bles, perform their tasks and 
maintain the cleanliness and 
presentation of the salad bar. 

Prepared potato, macaroni 
and cucumber salads present a 

"We all work hard to main-
tain its freshness and keep the 
customers happy," Williams 
said. "1 he salad bar is quite. pop-
ular among the students who 
choose to cat at Canyon Ista. 
I'm so surprised that a lot of the 
guys come in and get a salad. We 
hope that we can continue to 
maintain our customer satisfac-
tion."

Best Mexican How do you feel about the recent election? 

By KARLA DeVRIES 
Features Editor 

For a little taste of Mexico in 
John Muir College, visit EI 
Mercado, one of the newest 
campus dining experiences. 
Located under Sierra Summit 
and formerly the home of the 
Rathskeller, this themed resta-
raWlt offers a variety of Mexican 
food, from tacos to tostadas, 
enchiladas to quesadiUa . 

Rather than waiting for the 
taco special to come around at 
the other dining halls, students 
can gct fresh burritos and tacos 
all week long. Unfortunately, El 
Mercado is only open for lunch, 
from 1 I a.m. through 3 p.m., so 
you'll have to satisfy your 
south-of-the-border cravings 
early in the day. 

"It's the Cadillac of on-cam-
pus eating," said Robin 
Friedman, a John Muir College 
junior. "It's like a trip to Tijuana 
without the booze!" 

El Mercado provides a la 
carte options such as burritos 
and nachos, as well as combina-
tion plates with beans and rice. 
Tl1ere are also daily specials that 
provide a little something differ-
ent. Not ollly docs it cover the 
basics, but El Mercado also 
offer other elements that make 
the meal complete. These 
include tortilla and albondogas 
soup, a great salsa bar, hot car-
rots and even horchata. 

If you arc looking for a 
change from the usual pizza-
and-burgers fare of campus din-
ing halls, head to Muir for El 
Mercado's Mexican food . 

Best dessert 
By VlNEESHA MALKANI 

Contributing Writer 

There is no better way to top 
off an unfavorable dining hall 
meal than with your favorite cake 
for dessert. Ocean View Terrace is 
definitely the place to visir if 
you're looking for a way to satisfy 
your craving for something 
sweet. Despite the faCt that it's 
hidden in the corner of the cafe-
teria, snldents never fail to forget 
the selection of tempting desserts 
vr offers. Its glass display 

packed with mouth-watering 
cake make ir U13t much harder ro 
avoid U1C dreaded freshman 15. 

"It's closer to my dorm when I 
want dessert, and the fact that 
ovr is always so pa ked makes 
me want to go to their dessert 
ide even more," Thurgood 

Mar hall College sophomore 
Arwa Kassamali said. 

OW's cheesecake varieties 
are the most popular. 

"[ like to get cheesecake or 
just a smoothie for desert from 
OVT because they have so many 
choices. Just in cheesecakes, they 
have mango cheesecake, raspber-
ry swirl, regular and some other 
ones too," Kassamali said.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN M NDAY, OCTOBER 13,2003 

Water polo: Borso scores a double h at trick 
continued from page :10 

dcred by two consecutive BYU-
Hawaii scores, includi ng a failed 
one-on-one counterattack attempt 
by Ustaszewski, in which the BYU-
Hawaii goa lie intercepted a pass to 
give his team a three-on-two coun-
terattack offen e. 

Counterattacks were the popu-
lar strategy on Oct. 8 as the BYU-
Hawai i defense was not allowing a 
set offense to score. The final two 
goals of regulation were Peterson's 
goal on a three-on-three counter 
and a two-on-two counterattack, 
with 2: 13 on the clock. Hoplcins 
and Borso took off down the pool, 
using a series of q ujck wrist passes 
until Hopkins was fouled inside 
four meters, drawing the penalty 
shot, which he converted. 

T he Tritons were kept alive on a 
crucial block by sophomore goalie 
Colin McElroy with 4.9 seconds 
remaining in the gam e on a deflect-
ed cross-cage shot that would have 
meant certain victory for the 
Seasiders. 

Overtime quickly turned in to 
the Borso talent show. In the first of 
twO three-minute overtime peri-
ods, Borso recovered a Hopki ns 
shot a t two meters in front of the 
cage, drew an ejection and was left 
open for a point-blank leadi ng goal, 
only to see it 10 t on fatigued 
defense. But his ambition would 
not subside, and Borso si lenced the 
BYU-Hawaii bench with a stun-
ning ni ne-meter, high-corner, bar-
in shot for an 11-10 lead going in to 
the final overtime period . 

But that was all that the 
Seasiders could afford. The final 
three minutes were filled with laclc-

luster counterattacks , excessive 
grappling for position and a BYU-
Hawaii shutout. Borso offe red a 
follow-up outside shot, to complete 
his double hat trick, from seven 
meters with barely a minute left to 
play. 

T he highly anticipated game 
agajnst Long Beach State on Oct. 
10 turned into a shelling by the 
UCSD squad as the 4gers were 
s.lowly and steadjly crushed. 

Long Beach State came into the 
match ranked seventh, just one 
place behind the Tri tons, and stood 
to gain much ground from the vic-
tory, espec.ially after an 11 - 10 over-
time loss earlier this season at the 
SoCal Tournament. For a team 
with so much to prove, there was 
little evidence to suggest that Long 
Beach State had the better team. 

U ntil the 4gers scored a goal 
with 12.5 seconds remaining in the 
fi rst quarter, UCSD was proceed-
ing to shut out the 4gers, 3 -0. 

"We jumped o n them early and 
demoraliz.ed them a bit," 
Ustaszewski said . 

T he Tritons shu t down the 
4gers, 2- 1, in the second period, 

with goals by Peterson and Borso, 
putting the ho me team up, 5- 1. 

During the second per iod, the 
4gers' frustra tion was evident when 
Long Beach State goalie Thomas 
Onyshko took hold of UCS D 
junior Steve J endrusina and held 
him underwater by his shoulders, 
even after re ferees stopped play. 
Both players were ejected from the 
game for the confrontation, bur the 
damage was done. 

YAt 5- 1, [Long Beach State] 
didn 't seem at all into it . We 
stopped them ea rly and they knew 
it," Ustaszewslci said. 

By the half, the 4gers were 
through. The Long Beach State 
coaching staff was livid over the 
fact that the visiting team had been 
presented with four man-up oppor-
tunities with no conversio ns and 
had only been able to release fi ve 
shots in the game to that point. 

The UCSD squad fini shed the 
game at a score of 8-2. 

. "That's what we are ca pable of 
whe n everyon e comes out and 
shows devotion ," Ustaszewski said. 
"We play with that kind of intensi-
ty." 

Volleyball: Tritons net two straight win 
contlOl«!d from page :10 

Five lritons - Crandell, 
Dunsmore, H ogan, opposite Lauren 
Mllls, and middle blocker Kendra 
Canape - all reached double-digits 
III kilb. The feat is t:5pecially Impres-
Ive given the match was only three 

games long Wlth the Tritons Wln-
rung 30-24, 30-26, 30-26. 

The . eawolves squad that 
watched UCSD throughout warm-
ups came out slowly agaInst the 
' Ii- nons who !teemed only con-
cerned with them elves. 

"We focus on our side of the 
game. Duncan tells us a few thlllgs 
about the other tcam, but we've 
ju t gOt to focus on our side of the 
net and get the job done no matter 
what the other team does," 
Dunsmore aid. 

The Seawolves recovered their 
poise in game twO, snatchi ng the 
lead from UCSD midway through, 
but the Tritons rallied back due to 
consistcnt hitting and a solid 
defensive unit that racked up 64 
dJgs on the night ver u S U's 56. 

"We 've alway taken pride in 
our defen e, and It's always a goal 
to out-dig the other team," 
Dunsmore said. 

Game three took a familiar 
route as the Seawolves mounted a 
rally, but the Tritons came up with 
points when they needed them 
most to grab the 30-26 victory and 
the sweep. 

While improving their record, 
UCSD was al 0 able to develop 
their depth with 10 different play-
ers seeing time for UCSD over the 

weekend. In rhe lo ng run, 
McFarland feels that his players 
will b well served by oppo rnll1iues 
they havc now. 

"We're always looking to devel-
op ou r depth as much as we can," 
he said. ''The more player we have 
against these teams, the better off 
we are." 

The Triton depth will be further 
bolstered by the returns of opposite 

h1cy Peter on (previously ~vith an 
ankle injury), Illiddle blocker 
Brianna Koche (out due to monOllll-
cleo is), and o utside hitter Bonruc 
Wilson (out with a foot injury). 

The Tritons return to act ion 
Oct. 16 and ct. 17 when they 
travel to Cal State tanislaus and 
Cal State Bakersfield to begin the 
second half of the CM season.

Tritons enjoy tennis success 
Women's team reaches finals in doubles 

BY CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

Four players from rhe UCSD 
women's tenni team competed in 
the presea on Intercollegiate 
Tennis As ociation West Regional 
Tournament on Oct. 2 through 
Oct. 4. UCSD head coach Liz 
LaPlante sent one junior, Jasmin 
Dao, and three sophomores, J enna 
Ishii, Alison Ishii and Leigh 
Roberts, to play singles and dou-
bles. 

Dao, the only seeded Triton in 
ingles, breezed through her first 

three rounds of play before losing 
in the semifinals. Jenna Ishii , 
AJison Ishii and Roberts won two 
rounds each before losing to eed-
ed players. 

"Overall the girls played very 
well ," LaPlante said. "We hadn't 
had an:v workouts yet, but the gi rls 
ca me back in good shape and were 
ready for tough competi cion. 
They had to play twO rounds of 
singles and two rounds of doubles 
each day, so it was very tiring." 

Although the tournament was 
only in the preseason, it deter-
rrunes individual rankings for the 
upcoming season. jenna Ishii was 
victorious in her first twO rounds, 
defeating Amanda Wise of UC 
Davis in straight ers, 6-3 , 6-3 in 
the first round and Renee Paqui llo 
6-4, 6-4 in I he second round. he 
later faced o . 1 seed Kata lin 

agy of Cal State Bakersfield in 
the third round and lost 6-0, 6-2 . 

Alison Ishii soundly defeated 
Brittany Nelson of Western ew 
MeXICO (6- 1, 6-0) advancing her-
self to the second round against 
Elly wetl. of San Francisco State. 
After a fir t set VICtOry, she was 
unable to finish off Swetz, losing 

4 -6, 6-4,6-3. 
Roberts received a bye in the 

first round and faced Nancy Mok 
of UC Davis, whom she defeated 
in straight sets with identical 
scores of 6-3, 6-3, advancing her 
to the third round. Roberts con-
tinued her strong play in the third 
round, defeating Grand Canyon's 
Sa rah Mitchell (6-0, 6- 1) and 
advancing herself to the quarterfi -
nals, where she fe ll to Dehlia Feliz 
of Cal Poly Pomona, 6-4, 6-3 . 

Dao, seeded o. 3, recei ved a 
bye in the first round before 
defeating Yub Otaka ofUC Davis 
with a score of 7-5,6-3 in the sec-
ond round. Dao had mixed feel -
ings about playing Otab, a fellow 
Granada Hills High School gradu-
ate and ex-teammate. 

"It was ha rd to play Yuka 
because I knew her in high school, 
so it brought a menta l factor to the 
match, having to play against a 
former teammate," Dao said. 

Despite the circumstance, 
Dao breezed past Otaka in straight 
sets with a score of 7-5, 6-3 . She 
faced anor DeKcrmenjian of Cal 
Poly Pomona in the third round 
and easi ly won the match with a 
score of 6-0, 6-2 . 

This victory advanced Dao 10 
the quarterfinals against AJly 
Mu ller of U Davis, whom she 
has played close matches against in 
the past. 

"My match against Muller was 
a really big match because our 
matches always turn out so clo e," 
Dao said. "I was nervous but I 
focused harder because r wanted 
to compete well against her. It was 
a long and tiring match but I 
played pretty well." 

Dao indeed played well, edging 
Muller in straight sets with identi-

cal cores of 6-4, 6-4. This win 
advanced Dao to the semifinals 
against Hungarian-born Katalin 

agy of Cal State Bakersfield, the 
No. 1 seed. Dao fell to agy (6- 1, 
6-4), who went on 10 capture the 
ITA West Regional singles title. 
Although disappointed by the loss, 
Dao was happy to be playing com-
petitivelyagain. 

"I played pretty well the first 
three rounds despite being rusty 
because I haven 't been competing 
much lately. But, it all comes back 
together at the end. r was also real-
ly glad to play doubles, that's 
where I have the most fun ,» she 
said. 

The joy Dao has in doubles 
play translated into success for her 
and her partner Roberts, who 
reached the finals in the tourna-
ment. 

Dao and Roberts, the No. 3 
seed, received a bye in the first 
round and defeated Cal Poly 
Pomona's DeKermenjian and 
Jennie Burgraf 8-4 in the second 
round . Dao and Roberts contin-
ued their strong play in the quar-
terfinals and semifinals against 
UC Davis, beating Jan Fong and 
Audrey Wingo, 8-5, and Wise and 
Lehman,8-3 . 

Cal Poly Pomonas Feliz and 
Katrina H olmberg, the No. 4-
seeded doubles pair, proved to be 
tOO much for Dao and Roberts, 
who lost 8-3 in the finals. 

Even though the Tritons had 
not yet held a formal practice, the 
succe es of Dao, Roberts and the 
Ishiis look promisi ng for the 
upcomi ng ea on . 

"The team is looki ng really 
strong with all top players back 
and many strong freshmen joining 
the team," LaPlante said.

Kennedy (85th, 25 :41.8), Meghan 
Bellotti (l09th, 26: I 8.6) and Kate 
Branson ( I 54th, 28:42.3) were the 
remaining Tritons in the fi eld of 
199. 

UCSD's top five runners had a 
solid time gap of 51 seconds in the 
6K. The divisional title won on 
Oct I I was the second one in a 
row for the Triton women in this 
event. 

Many of the top Triton women 
were resting for the upcoming 
CCAA Championships. 

"It's a tough course, but the girls 
stuck through it and had a good 
finish ," Hodgins said. 

The Division II race was com-
posed of NCAA Division IT and 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics programs. 
The Triton women are ranked 17th 
nationally in Division n. UCLA 
won both the overall ream compe-
tition (60 points) and was also top 
of the six Division I programs on 
hand (47 points). Irvna Vashchuk 
of USC ran the course in 21 :56.6 
for the individual title. 

The hilly course is a sandy one, 
but the rain had allowed for greater 
traction for the runners. 

"The gradual ups in the course 
kill you, plus it's usually pretty 
sandy, but the rain sta bilized 
things," Hodgins said. 

The UCSD men had a mixed 
bag performance, since the top 
seven men 's runners were rested to 
prepare for the CCAA 
Champion hips on Oct. 25 . This 
allowed many new runners to 
shine. 

"We worked the course, and I'm

despite missing seven lop runners. 
pretty satisfied with my time, but 
we are a little disappointed with 
our overall team ," sophomore 
Chris Beedey-Hagler saId . 

Beetley-Hagler came in 27th, 
with a time of 26:44.5 . Eric Nilsen 
followed at 43rd, delivering a time 
of 27:22.3 for the Tritons. 

"I did OK, but I didn't run my 
best - we didn't run our top 
squad, however, we finished as a 
group," Nilsen aid . 

The men's race had many strong 
finishes garnered by Orange Coast 
Community College and UCLA. 

The Tritons wi ll be back in 
action next weekend, hosting the 
UC D alumni in an exhibition 
meet beginning at 9 a.m. on the 

orth Campus Course as part of 
UCSD Homecoming 2003 festiVI-
ties. They will then travel to Chico, 
Calif., for the CCi\A 
Championships on ct. 25.

Even the 
world of 

sports needs 
a recall 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

I n honor of the termination of Gray DavIs, the pending in tallation of the 
"GovernatOr" and the recall fever 
that's sweeping the state, I offer 
you the tOP I 0 things in sports that 
need to be recalled. 

10. Ugly San Diego U niforms: 
T he Chargers have the nasty pow-
der blues and the Padres look 
ridiculous in camouflage. Trust me, 
even without ugly uniforms, nei-
ther of the e teams will have any 
trouble looking bad on the field . 

9. The Five Game Divisional 
cries: Does it make any sense for 

baseball team to play 162 regular 
cason games and then skimp out on 

a full seven-game senes in the fir t 
round? True, the poor Ns would 
probably end up winning the first 
three games of a seven-game series 
before cholo ng, but a better system 
I worth a Imle extra heanbreak.

plea~e get t:lus guy off my TV' "He 
could ... go ... all .. . the .. . way" to 
the unemployment office. Then the 
mute button on my remote wouldn't 
be quite so worn out. 

7. Lame tudents at UCSD: All 
of those people who complain about 
the absence of thmgs to do at 
UCSD, then end up sitting home 
on a Saturday night studyi ng their 
cell-bio-chem-bio-chem-chem-bio 
textbook for a midterm that isn't for 
three weeks. ince I know that my 
readers would never do such a 
thing, if you happen to know people 
like thiS, please tell them that 
UC D has one of the tOP athletic 
programs in the naoon, and that the 
volleyball, soccer and water polo 
games that are happerung right now 
are worth their attention. 

6 . The I ew York Yankees: 
Unlike DaVIS, who was recalled for 
excessive incompetence, I'd like to 
recall the Yankees for their exces-
sive excellence. To pur it frankly, 
I'm JUSt Sick of eemg J oe Torre's 
big no e every smgle postseason.

Men's water polo trounces twice at home 
Denny Harper coaches his 400th victory 

By MAnHEW GRANT 
Contributing Writer 

The No.6 Triton men's water 
polo quad defeated both of its 
opponents at home this past week, 
first edging Out No. 15 BYU-
Hawaii 12- 10 in overtime on Oct. 
, then demolishing o. 7 Long 

Beach State 8-2 on ct. 10 at the 
Canyonview Pool. T he Tritons 
lined up against a BYU-Hawaii 
team that had clearly anticipated 
an up Ct. The victory over BYU-
Hawaii wa UCSD head coach 
Denny Harper's 400th career win . 

"We know they're good. Part 
of us may have been looking past 
the [BYU-HawaiiJ game to the 
two other big games that we have 
this week," senior Matthew 
Ustasz.ew ki said. 

UCSD came out strong offen-
sively in the first quarter, deliver-
ing a barrage of hots to BYU-
Hawaii goalie Peter Caley but 
were matched goal-for-goal until 
sophomore Chris Eicholz scored 
with 37. econds remaining in the 
fi rst, putting UCSD up 4-3 . 

The fire on the BYU-Hawaii 
bench was fueled by a rock-solid 
defen e and goals in the third and 
fourth minutes to give them a 5-4 
lead. 

But during what would have 
been their final posse sion of the 
half, the Tmons et the ball to 
Ustaszewslo who rifled a backhand

Holy smokes: UCSD sophomore Kevin Smoker looks to pass the ball to a teammate in the men's water polo game 
against No. 15 BYU-Hawall. The Tritons beat the Seasiders in overtime 12-10 at Canyonvlew Pool on ad. 8. 
from his left across the cage into 
the upper-right crossbar where it 
was recovered by junior Clark 
Peterson . On the recovery, 
U taszew ki's defender illegally 
fouled him in dead time, leading 
to a UCSD man-up offen e and a 
full defensive crash with less than a 
minute remammg m the hal f. A 
pump fake and perfect pass from 

Peterson set junior Brandon Borso 
up for h i second goal of the game 
and a halftime tie. 

The third quarter was a defen-
ive battle on both ends of the 

tank, where both teams managed 
only one goal each. Junior 
Jonathan Hopkin cored with 
3:30 remaining in the quarter on a 
cross pa s to the right wing. where 

he expertly faked twice and deliv-
ered the ball to the back of the net 
for the only score of the third 
quarter.

Top--ranked Tritons win two

Senior Staff Writer 

The top-ranked UCSD 
women 's volleyball team contin -
ued its winning streak, steam-
rolling San Francisco State and 
getting past a scra ppy Sonoma 
State team in three games each. 
The Tritons improved to 16-2 
overall, and retain their share of 
the California Collegiate 
Athleoc As ociation lead with a 
10-1 record in the conference. 

The SFSU Gators came to 
RIMAC on Oct. 10 with a 2-7 
record JI1 the CCAA and were 
expected to have little chance to 
compete . The Tntons' focus 
ensured JUSt that. 

wWe've always been told, and 
my mentality is, to never under-
estimate a team," U SD outside 
hitter Lindsay Crandell said. 
"Teams mow that we're good 
and that we're ranked really high 
and they're going to come in and 
play their best match against us." 

SFSU's best wasn't good 
enough, however, a the Tritons 
took the fi rst game qUickly by a 
score of 30-18 WIth the strength 
of ITiiddle blocker JUoe Hogan' 
seven lolls. U SD came back to 
take game two a well, 30-24. In 
game three, Triton head coach 
Duncan McFarland mixed up hl

to some of the other players, but 
U SD sull took the game easily,
