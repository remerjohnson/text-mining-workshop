SeCOildband Smoke 
RIIk ConfIrmed 
SAN FRANCISCO - Two 
UCSF researchers reported ilt 
this week's Journal of the 
American Medical Association 
that levels of secondhand 
smoke encountered by many 
people are sufficient to 
substantially damage the 
cardiovaScular system. A non-
smoker exposed to secondhand 
tobacco smoke has a 30 
percent increased risk of heart 
disease compared to someone 
who is not exposed, Professor 
of Medicine Stanton A. Glantz 
and Professor of Medicine and 
Cardiology Division Chair 
William W. Parmley wrote in 
their study. According to 
Glantz and Parmley, the 
simplest and most cost-
effective way to limit damage 
from passive smoke is to 
mandate smoke-free work-
places, schools and public 
places.

Local Chancellors Denounce Loan Cuts 
FUNDING: Federal 
proposals would ax $20 
billion in student aid 
By Ben Elaln 
Associate News Editor 

Denouncing federal proposals to 
cut $20 billion in federal student-
loan programs, San Diego's top 
higher-education leaders met to ~is­
cuss possible impacts of the cuts at 
the University of San Diego on Tues-
day. 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 

Atkinson joined the leaders of San 
Diego State University, San Marcos 
State University, the University of 
San Diego, and the San Diego Com-
munity College District (SDCC) to 
speak at the unprecedented confer-
ence. 

While acknowledging the 
government's difficult task of defi-
cit reduction, the administrators 
voiced concern over Congress' bal-
anced-budget efforts coming at the 
expense of affordable higher educa-
tion. 

"The private and public [univer-

HEAD HONCHOS 

sities] are united in our concern," 
said Atkinson. "It is increasingly 
difficult for [students] to come to a 
university ... 

Congressional proposals include 
the elimination of interest-deferred 
loans, Perkins Loans and Supple-
mental Education Opportunity 
Grants. Coupled with possible re-
ductions in the federal work-study 
program, the federal government 
would save close to $20 billion pre-
viously earmarked for financial aid. 

The university leaders said a steep 
decline in state funding has left them 

unprepared to address cuts at the 
federal level, as well. 

"These are not good times for 
universities," said Atkinson. "To 
have something like this come along 
at the federal level really compli-
cates things. 

"We art wave our hands and say 
the quality of higher education has 
not been hurt, but I think it's been 
very hurt," he added. "We are de-
ceiving ourselves if we think that 
we've managed to maintain the qual-
ity of education."

Gym MayBe

FACILmES: Main Gym and

SyM ....... VW· 
AsSOCiate News Editor 

The UCSD Dance Program may gain exclu-
sive use of the Main Gym, causing Recreation 
programs which currently use the space to find 
other facilities. 

The Main Gym and the Natatorium, which 
are currently under the management of Sports 
Facilities, will officially become the responsi-
bility of Academic Affairs as of July 1, 1995. 
The Recreation Gym will remain under the 
management of Student Affairs. The space was 
formerly used by the P.E. Department. 

Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
Marjorie Caserio has proposed that authority 
over the Main Gym should be officially trans-
ferred to the Theatre Department, which admi n-
isters the Dance Program. She has also proposed 
that the Main Gym be renovated to better ac-
commodate dance classes in terms of dimen-
sions, flooring and ventilation. 

Caserio said that other activities could take 
place in the gym, but added that dance would 
have priority in this case.

UCSD Professor Falls Victim to Suspected Drunk Driver 
By Jonna Palmer 
Senior Staff Writer 

A light in the battle to save lives 
was extinguished last Sunday when 
UCSD Clinical Professor Dr. 
Roderick Calverley was killed in an 
auto accident. 

Only a week before the accident, 
Calverley had returned from 
Sarajevo where he helped provide 
medical attention to needy commu-
nities. Calverley's co-worker at the 
UCSD medical center, Dr. Lawrence 
Saidman, said that he and Calverley 
had begun their careers at UCSD on 
the same day in September, 1972. 

He also said Calverley was devas-
tated by what he had seen in Bosnia. 
"[He was] a person who thought a 
great deal about other people, espe-
cially those who were less fortu-
nate," said Saidman. 

Saidman added that Calverley 
had spent much of his life volun-
teering as a doctor in underdevel-
oped countries. Calverley was espe-
cially concerned with assisting prac-
ticing physicians and teaching them 
more advanced medical techniques. 

UCSD Professor and Chief of 
Anesthesiology John Drummond 
said Calverley had been a partici-

pant in numerous "medical mercy 
missions" around the world before 
his death at age 56. 

According to Highway Patrol 
Spokesman Art Athans, Calverley 
was killed while driving on High-
way 78 in Borrego Springs. Athans 
said that Calverley's wife was pre-
paring to make a left-hand tum in 
their VW Vanagon when Leonord 
Dutkiewicz attempted to pass them 
and sm~hed into the rear of the van. 

Dr. Calverley, who had been rest-
ing in the back of the van, was 
ejected out of the rear of the van by 
the force of the impact. He passed 

away before the Highway Patrol 
arrived on the scene. 

His daughter and a friend were 
also in the van at the time of the 
accident, but did not sustain serious 
injuries. 

Athans said that Dutkiewicz was 
suspected of having been driving 
while under the influence of alco-
hol, but that the final blood test 
would not be available for three to 
six weeks. 

Saidman said that he remembered 
Calverley as, "someone who was 
caring beyond that which is nor-
mally found, even in good people.

The San Diego Chapter of the 
National Organization for the Re-

presented its medical marijuana fo-
rum Tuesday night before an audi-
ence of approximately 75 students 

He added that "The only person 
who can't get marijuana right now 
is the person who needs it most, the 
terminally ill patient in the chemo-
therapy room." 

In the wake of 1364's failure, 
NORML is now and community 

members. 
A panel of six 

speakers presented 
information and 
opinions to educate 
students and culti-
vate support for the 
legalization of me-
dicinal marijuana at 
the Solis Hall meet-
ing.

If that biII also

being proposed for

an organization af-
filiated with 
NORML, Califor-
nians for Compas-

According to 
sclerosis patients. 

AccordingtoQliforniaNOtML 
Chair Dennis Peron, "These people 
are struggling to live and marijuana 
is helping them live." 

Despite a national law-enforce-
ment policy which Ippel1S to be 
moving toward stricter penalties for 
marijuana cultivation and traffick-
ing, the number of voices favoring 
the legaliution of marijuana for me-
dicinal purposes is growing. 

Thirty-six states have recently 
passed bills or resolutions support-
ing the legalization of marijuana for 
medical use. 

According to the 1990 Harvard 
study, 46 percent of cancer special-
ists recommended marijuana to 
their patients. 

According to Harvard Professor 
Stephen Jay Gould, marijuana 
helped him to recover from illness 
and prompted him to write, Kit is 
beyond my comprehension that any 
humane person would withhold such 
a beneficial substance from people 
in such great need. " 

Even Republican Representative 
-.Brian Bilbray has voiced support 

for studies into the feasibility of 
medicinal marijuana legalization. In 
1994, State Bill 1364, which legal-
ized the medicinal use of marijuana 
in Califomia, passed in both the 
State Assembly and Senate, but was 
vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson. 

The irony, according to Peron, is 
that "anybody can get marijuana 

panel speaker Mary 
Rathburn, "It isn't about marijuana, 
it's about what this country has be-
come and about what we, as citi-
zens, want it to be." 
, Rathbum, a 71-year-old grand-
mothernicbwned"BrownieMary," 
became well-known when she wu 
arrested for distributing marijuana 
brownies to terminally ill AIDS pa-
tients. 

Following vocal public support 
for her cause, charges against 
"Brownie Mary" were dropped. 

Nearly 411 those involved in the 
legalization debate acknowledge 
that pharmaceutical companies have 
an interest in marijuana reform. 
Members of the panel said they be-
lieve that large pharmaceutical com-
panies are their biggest opponents, 
because they have developed a syn-
thetic alternative to marijuana. 

NORML organizers said that 
they are dedicated to win medicinal 
marijuana legalization. Peron, who 
also runs a "buyer's club" to pur-
chase marijuana for terminally ill 
patients in San Francisco, said, "I've 
been busted by those guys (the p0-
lice] so many times we're on a first-
name basis." He said he hopes me-
dicinal legalization will be the 
begining of general reformation of 
the mariju.na law. 

"It is going to happen in a num-
ber of steps," Peron said, "the first 
step is the legalization of medicinal 
marijuana use."

UCSD Nobel Laureate Dies at Age 86 
Nobel Prize winner and UCSD SenIor Lecturer 

Hannes AIfv6n died Sunday nl&ht at his home in 
SWeden at age 86. 

AIMn was born on May 30, 1908 In Norrt<oping, 
Sweden and was awarded his doctorate at the Univer· 
sIty of Uppsala, Sweden. He served as a senior 
lecturer in UCSO's Department of Applied Physics and 
Infonnatlon Science from 1967 to 1970, spending 
half of each year at the Royal Institute of Technology 
In Sweden. 

Scripps Institution of Oceanography Professor 
Gustaf AntIenlus agreed with the characterization by 
AJfv6n's former associates that he was a "gentle, wild 
man.· "By. 'gentle' it was meant that he avoided the 
llmell&ht and did not forcefully push his ideas. By wild 
it meant that he took no ideaforgranted; he was a bold

UCSD Profeaor finds African 
Meteor May be frGlft ... 

UCSD Professor of Cosmochemistry Kurt Marti 
discovered that a footbalJ-slzed meteorite which 
crashed into NIgeria more than three decades ago 
probably came from Mars. 

"Since recent spacecraft missions to Mars have 
failed, and no new Martian spacecraft data will be 

obtained during the next few years, these samples 
that we have will permit further study of Mars, - said 
Marti. 

-The nice thing about this is that they were deliv-
ered free of charge,· he added. 

The 4~und meteorite is housed at the Geologi-
cal Survey of Nigeria, minus a one-pound sample 
which Is on display at the Smithsonian Museum in 
Washington, D.C., and a few tiny glassy chips which 
were removed by Marti and his co-wor1<ers. 

Study of the glassy chips revealed that the isotopic 
ratios of the nitrogen, argon and xenon trapped in the 
chips compared closely with data sent back from the 
Viking Spacecraft·s 1976 mission to Mars. 

"There were many skepticS, and this skepticism 
was reasonable. But based on the information avail-
able now, the probability that these are both Martian 
is fairly hleh,· said Marti. Marti added that absolute 
proof will require another mission to Mars.

Fee Hikes Up for Vote Next Week 
A.S.: 'I did it in the 
voting booth' condoms 
will be given to voters 
By HI ... IIouIhton 
Staff Writer 
and Huther MeR .. 
Staff Writer 

Students will have an opportu-
nity to vote on issues such as fee 
hikes, a UCSD football team, affir-
mative action and student govern-
mentcandidatesduring theA.S. elec-
tions next week. 

Twenty-one student government 
positions and three fee referenda 
will be on the ballot for students at 
polling sites around campus April 
11-13. 

The first and largest of the fee-
increase proposals, the Campus Life 
Bill, would raise the Student Activ-
ity Fee, currently $13.50 per quar-
ter, by $29.50 per quarter to estab-
lish a football team ($]5), aid inter-
collegiate sports athletes ($ 10) and 
incrust A.S. programming and stu-
dent organization funding ($4.50). 

The second referendum would 
raise the fee by $3 and would go 
solely to recreational sports teams. 

The final fee referendum, pro-
posed by A.S. candidate Naomi Falk, 
would cost students $6.50 per quar-
ter, of which $2 ue earmarked for a 
student-run recruitment and reten- · 
tion program and $4.50 for A.S. 
funds. 

Students will also have the op-
portunity to vote on candidates for 
A.S. and college council positions. 

The two presidential candidates 
are Falk, who is ruMing on the 
"Legalize It" slate, and independent 
John Barnes. 

Falk, who is currently UCSO's 
representative to the UC Student 
Association, and the other members 
of the "Legalize It" slate are cam-
paigning on a platform of "student 
empowerment and advocacy" as well 
as increased A.S. accessibility to stu- . 
dents and improved A.S. program-
ming. 

Barnes, who is the currenl A.S. 
vice president administrative, could 
not be reached for comment. 

The vice president administra-
tive candidates are independent 
Rebecca Clark; "Uniting New Ideas 
Through Experience" (UNITE)slate 
candidate Jennifer Nicoll; "legal-
ize It~ -slate candidate Tom Schmitt; 
and "Great Triumvirate"-slate can-
didate Angelica Leon. 

Nicoll said that while her slate is 
not anti-establishment, it does stand 
in opposition to the status quo. She 
lidded the slate's experience com-
bined with its new ideas makes it the 
best choice. 

"Legalize It" -slate candidate and 
current Koala Editor In Chief Tom 
Schmitt and independent Rebecca 
Clark could not be reached for com-
ment. 

Campus Office Director for the 

A.S. External OffICe Erik Nielsen is 
running for vice president external 
affaiB, unopposed. Nielsen orga-
nized the "Shiris Off Our Backs" 
fee-hike protest held in February. 

Running for the vice president 
finance position are independent 
Joanna Cheng; the "UNITE"-slate 
candidate Edmondo Robinson; and 
"Legalize It" -slate candidate Nelson 
Sun. 

"UNITE" slato candidate 
.Robinson is the current Student Af-
firmative-Action Coalition repre· 
sentative to the A. S. 

According to campaign litera-
ture, as vice president of finance he 
wants to prioritize student organi-
zations and ensure fairness in the 
A.S.-funding process. 

According to Falk, Sun wants to 
cut the finance office bureaucracy 
and give more money to student 
organizations rather than the A.S. 

In the past, voter turnout for A.S. 
elections hu been low. According 
to A.S. Election Manager Mike 
Lindstrom, only 13 percent of the 
student body actually cast ballots 
last year. Lindstrom said his goal is 
to raise election turnout to 20 per-
cent this year . 

Lindstrom said tbe A.S. will of-
fer incentives to bring students to 
the pools, including giving voters 
condoms printed with the message, 
"I did it in the voting booth," hand-
ing out lollipops and offering free 
Colces from Price Center vendon.

I n California, one out of every six students was born outside the United States, and one out of every three speaks a language other than En-
glish. Total enrollment in U.S. public schools in-
creased only 4.9 percent between 1986 and 1991, 
while the number of students with little or no 
knowledge of English increased 50 percent - from

t.S million to 2.3 million - and 
that number is climbing. Today, 
more than 80 percent of immi-
grants arrive here from Asia and 
LalinAmerica, often with minimal, 
if any, education. 

The United States, as it has 
many times in its 2OO-plus-year 
history, is experiencing a massive 
inflow of immigration which many 
.. native" citizens perceive as a 
th..e.tlo education. "Many schools 
with influxes of immigrant chil-
dren with specific educational 
needs weren't coping well to be-
gin with,· says Ira Mehlman ofthe 
Federation for AmeRcan Immigra-
tion Reform, a group which pr0-
motes clamping down on immigra-
tion. ·You can't keep throwing 
these types of children into a 
school system and expect us to 
have an educated population ... in 
thia society."

attorney and a Republican guber-
natorial candidate in Florida, &peel: "Hundreds of 
millions of cIollan are beilllltolen from American 
children who need computers, boob and pards. • 

More subtly, and perhapl even more condemn-

illl in the eyes of the nation, many English-speak-
ing reaidents feel forced out of urban neighbor-
hoods, where most immigrants first reside after 
coming to the United States. These residents often 
think that teachers have less lime to spend witb their 
own children due to the educational demands of 
immigrant students, and perbapI are even intimi-
dated by the diversity of culturea in the classroom. 
All these fears tend to influence American feelings 
against bilingual education. 

Yet, there are several compelJing reasons why 
bilingual education ia favorable over an Engliah-
only education. First, primary school teachers have 
long observed that an EngIish-onJy education works 
fine with younger students, but often proves too 
rigorous for older children, who may grow frus-
trated and subsequently become disintereated in 
school. These older children, whose cultural iden-
lity has 101ll been determined and internalized, must 
now cope with a completely new and alien envi-
ronment. Learning simply to adjust to sucb a trau-
matic change is challenging enough without teach-
ers insisting tbat EngIiab as a Second Language 
(BSL) students immediately learn a new language 
to be integrated into regular classes. Faced with 
such obstacles, how many Englisb-speaking stu-
dents would have made it tbrough school in a non-
Englisb-speaking country? 

With a bilingual education, however, the transi-
tion from one world into another is made gradu-
ally and thus more successfully. In 1993, IS-year-
old Vietnamese immigrant Nguyen Nguyen said, 
-I have to understand in Vietnamese first, so I can 
translate it into Eaaliah. I learn bestthia way.·

The Bilingual Education Act was passed in 1968 
in a fit of governmental compassion and its casual-
ties to date run well into the millions. Like other 
government programs enacted with the best of in-
tentions, it has been corrupted by politics and spe-
cial-interest groups. The purported aim of bilingual 
education was 10 teach students in their own lan-
guage so that they could keep pace with their En-
glish-speaking classmates. In practice, the act has 
become a mechanism of ethnic nar-
ciasism and a bastion of white-Eu-
ropean basbing. 

Commandeered by opportunis-
tic racial agitators from the Left, 
classrooms bsve become trans-
formed into propaganda machines. 
They offer unbalanced accounts of 
Columbus as the harbinger of the 
evi~ pillaging Europeans. Wasbing-
ton, Jefferson and other Founding 
Fathers are depicted as racist, mi-
sogynist oppressors and loser 
pinkos like Abbie Hoffman, 
Patricia Ireland and Malcolm X are 
described as visionaries. 

Funded by the U.S. Department 
of Education (now tbere's a gov-
ernment agency that needs to be de-
molished), entrenched programs in 
places like New Y~rk, New Jersey 
and California often force immi-
grant or non-Englisb speaking stu-
dents to enroll in classes taught in 
their native language - often 
against tbe wishes of the students 
themselves, who know better than

Washington bureaucrats. These students know the 
only ticket out of poverty is a solid aptitude in En-
glish. 

The students, in programs funded by the De-
partment of Education, assimilate into the English-
speaking culture slower than students of traditional 
English as a Second Language (ESL) program. 
Thia is not surprising when one co .. iden that the

REFERENDUM COMMENTARY DISTORTS FACTS 
Editor: 

For the record, the Campus Life 
Referendum would provjde much 
more to students than just a football 
team. Every penny of additional ac-
tivity fees it would generate would 
directly benefit UCSD undergradu-
ate stude'!.ts~ and would not be used 
to balance Willie Brown's legisla-
tive budget for California, as do the 
fee increases the regents have been 
forced 10 implement. 

The actual breakdown of the 
$29.50 is as follows: Fifteen dollars 
would establish and maintain a 
UCSD NCAA Division III football 
team. Ten dollars would increase 
funding for all intercollegiate teams 
other than football, not club and in-
tramural sports as the ever-compe· 
tent Brent Johnson reported (" A.S. 
Football Proposal Should Be 
Benched," March 16). The remain-
ing $4.50 would not only go toward 
improving A.S. programming 
events, it would also increase avail-
able funding for all eligible student 
organizations and for activities 
sponsored by each of the five indio 
Vidual college councils. 

The Guardian editorial board, 
Brent Johnson, Naomi Falk and the 
other three people on campus who 
are actually opposed to the Campus 
Life Referendum (from here on re-
ferred to as "no-lifers") do not seem 
to understand, or care, that the $10 
per-student allocation (to intercol-
legiate teams other than football) 
would substantially increase fund-
ing for our existing teams. UCSD 
currently has over 20 intercollegiate 
athletic teams, all of which are 
underfunded. 

Our student athletes have met 
the same academic standards for . 
admission as non-athletes and none 
are permitted to receive athletic 
scholarships. On top of their aca-
demic demands and the many hours 
they spend training and competing 
eacb week, most of our athletes 
have to spend additional time do-
ing fund-raisers (or payout of their 
own pockets) to cover basic travel 
and equipment costs. Our dedicated 
coaches are drastically underpaid, 
forcing many to find second jobs 
to survive. Although the university 
does provide most of the current 
funding for our teams, more is be-
ing spent on the new "Library 
Walk" than has been spent on our 
entire intercollegiate athletics de-
partment over the last three years 
combined. 

Knowledge of such facts is 
enough to expose the abject igno-
rance conveyed by Brent "Screw 
Our Athletes" Johnson's comments 
such IS " .•• these [athletic) programs 
have been - by design of the uni-
versity - supporting themselves 
successfully for years." So this is 
why our junior-varsity baseball 
team was recently eliminated due to 
lack of funding; it must not have 
been part of the "design of the uni-
versity." If the elimination of the 
Guardian were part of the "design 
of the university," Brent "Brilliant" 
Johnson would probably just snivel 
as he ate his words. 

Speaking of hypocrites, this 
brings me to the leader of the "no-
life" movement, Naomi Falk. As 
one of the most blindly anti-fee ac-
tivists on campus, she was appar-

entty Upset tbat the Campus Life 
Referendum would increase the ac-
tivity fee. To demonstrate her 
strong position against fee in-
creases, Falk proposed her own fee-
increase referendum. Other than a 
tiny amount going to recruitment 
and retention of under-represented 
students at UCSD, the bulk of 
Falk's fee would go to the A.S. bu-
reaucracy, and the students would 
see no impact. 

The Guardi4n never mentioned 
that bit of information. It would 
never dispute a fee increase that 
Falk proposed. The editorial board 
and Falk are ideological soul-mates, 
opposed to anything which cannot 
be found scribbled on the walls of 
the Ch~ Cafe. Since the Guardi4n 

(buck) 

consists of strict "no-lifers," Falk 
will undoubtedly receive its en-
dorsement for A.S. president. 

Establishing a football team, 
whether everyone would enjoys it 
or not, could only benefit the uni-
versity. Harvard, Yale, Stanford, 
Berkeley and most other prestigious 
universities have been able to main-
tain football programs and academic 
excellence. Why can't UCSD? 

To thoroughly correct the inac-
curacies and distortions exuded by 
the Guardian, I would have to write 
a book. We, the students, will de-
cide by casting our votes in the A.S. 
election next week. All I ask is that 
people make their decisions based 
o'n facts - not on tbe fictitious, bi-
ased, playground journalism prac-
ticed by the Guardi4n. Though most 
"no-lifers" have not even read the 
referendum, they nevertheless op-
pose it. Obviously, nobody at the 
Guardian read it, considering they 
made the same substantial errors 
regarding the different destinations 
of the $29.50 in three different ar-
ticles in three different issues. 

Albert Einstein once said, "Great 
spirits have always encountered vio-
lent opposition from mediocre 
minds." Think about it.

UCSD Football Is Not 
War III the Extra Fee 
EdItor: 

I am appalled by the possible 
raise in student fees from the Cam-
pus Life Referendum in next week's 
elections. It should not be this easy 
to sponsor fee increases. If this bill 
does indeed pass, I envision many 
copy-cat bills for the next election. 

Engineering students would have 
a more enjoyable time at UCSD if 
more computing n:soun:es were avail-
able. Therefore, why doesn't the En-
gineering Department sponsor a $30 
fee increase 10 buy a couple hundred 
Sun Spare Workstations? This would 
definitely make the undergraduate en-
gineering experience more satisfying. 

The lack of modem dial-ups 
makes it difficult for students 10 dial 
into the UCSD network. A simple 
$30 fee would let Network Opera-
tions buy a couple thousand 28,800 
BPS modems. Wouldn't this be asu-
per addition 10 campus life? 

But we can't forget thst UCSD 
doesn't hold enough concerts at the 
Price Center. I propose a $30 fee so 
we can have Oingo 8oingo play at 
the Price Center. With a simple fee, 
we can hear them play every Fri-
day. Many students would enjoy this 
addition 10 "campus life." 

I find it hard to believe that stu-
dents would support any fee in-
crease. The Campus Life Bill should 
be a warning that the fee-increase 
process needs to be re-examined.

ENGLISH: 
ContInued ...... ,... 4 
portance of undentanding proper 
Engl ish. EVlde, of COIU5e, is the op-
erative word. Any program whose 
terminal product is I student who 
cannot understand standard English 
damns him to the status of a sec· 
ond-c::lass citizen in our society. Bi· 
lingual education is a postponement 
of the harsh reality that the first step 
toward failure in this country is to 
remain ignorant of good English. 

As a minority Ind In immigrant 
myself, I am in the unique position 
to criticize bilingual education with· 
out suffering the usual hail of vcr· 
biage and accusations of racism -
which, interestingly enough, ilIus· 
trates all too clearly Ihe racially 

• loaded agendas of the supporters of 
bilingual education. When I first 
came to the United States a little 
over 11 years ago, the only English 
word I knew wu "elephant," from 
Sesame Street - a word of limited 
use, even in the vicinity of a zoo. I 
had to learn English quickly or be 
left with lone-word vocabulary 
which would 110 doubt guarantee me 
a slol on the lowest rung of the 
American eCOlpmic food chain -
a fate I wu determined to avoid. Of 
course, in the !art of Kansas, where 
I grew up, there was no bilingual 
teacher. In flet, we were the only 
Asian family in a SOO-mile radius. 
In this trying atmosphere, I was 

forced to learn at an acc:elerated 
pace and eventually graduated high 
sch~1 in California al the only 
Asian at my school to break a 700 
verbal SAT score. 

It wun't coy to struggle along-
side others whose English education 
began a deCide before mine. It 
wun't easy to face the fact that 
much of what I said wu misunder-
stood because of my accent. But to 
say that these experiences were det-
rimental is to ignore the fundamen-
tal purpose of an education. Schools 
are not in the business of making 
people comfortable. They exist to 
teach and prepare young people to 
enter the workforce with founda-
tional skills to make them produc-
tive members of society. Straying 
from this mission, 1$ tempting and 
politically seductive u it may be, is 
catastrophic for the ethnicities we 
purport to help. 

The United States is I melting-
pot nation_ With this unique philoso-
phy of inclusion, there naturally 
needs to be a shared language which 
bridges people of differing nations. 
Pretending that immigrants need not 
know English is the greatest disser-
vice we can offer, and the surest 
guarantee of their failure. 

In I country whose very laws are 
written in English. whose legal 
philosophicil foundations are 
rooted in European traditions. only 
a hardened white·supremacist 
would favor a system of education 

Thunday,April6,199S 

that denies English and Western 
Civilization to immigrants. Yet, in 
an ironic twist of events, this gaunt· 
let is gladly taken up not by nco-
nazis, but by the so-called leaders 
of ethnic groups which bilingual 
education affects. With every gen· 
eration denied English. the disen· 
franchised will be truly truncated 
from the mainstream of society, 
both economically and politically. 
This is unac:c:eptable. In the end, we 
all pay the price of a stratified soci-
ety, because every person below the 
poverty line is supported by some· 
one above it. 

We must insist that children have 
I solid command ofthe English Ian· 
guage before we hand them a di-
ploma. The Bilingual Education Act 
is a worthless feel-good gesture 
which damns the "graduate" to a 
life of menial jobs and sub-par op-
portunities. If a dumb guy like my-
self can assimilate in ~ few years 
just by being thrust into an English· 
only environment, anytme can learn 
the language. given the proper train-
ing. We must demand more of our 
educational system. and deport 
those who cannot assimilate. The 
time has come to end the phony at-
tempt at pretending we are a "mul-
lilingual" society and revive En-
glish u the standard language of 
our country. 

If not, we'd best just pack our 
bags and all move to the non-En-
gHsh speaking country of What.

cation. "It's very simple," says 
Winnie Porter, a bilingual 'teacher at 
the Cesar Chavez Elementary 
School in San Francisco. "You teach 
the children in the language they 
think in; then they understand the 
concepts. Once they understand the 
concepts. they can transfer these 
skills tn.a ICCOnd language_ I know 
it works. I've been doing it for 10 
years and see the results." 

Of all the people complaining 
about immigrants stealing funding 
from "native" children's education. 
it is surprising that the front-liners 
- the teachers and local adminis-
trators handicapped by a lack of 
funds - are often not among them. 
Lorraine McDonnell, a consultant at 
the Rand Corporation and co-author 
of a report on immigrants in school. 
says, "What we found is that. at the 
local level, schools and ind ividuals 
are doing the best they can. The im-

migrant children are easer and 
hardworkins, and teachers love to 
teach them. But they are not geHins 
the assistance they need ... Bilingual 
edUcation, like all other upects of 
American education, is suffering 
from the Isck of funding, but it cer-
tainly is not in itself economically 
or culturally threatening. 

Another consideration is the is-
sue of cultural education. Should 
not the culture of the immigrant stu-
dents also be considered? Main-
stream education in this country is 
decidedly biased - the language 
and the subject matter taught is 
Eurocentric years before schools 
inlroduce other cultures. When 
other cultures are taught. they are 
presented as alternative lifestyles to 
be studied. rather than being rich 
and fulfilling in their own right. By 
teaching from an English-only 
standpoint, we could rob immigrant 
students of the chance 10 study the 
culture from which they come.

against the uniquely American char. 
acter of equal opportunity for all-
regardless of race. religion, sex and 
origin. We must. by law, provide all 
children with an education, whether 
they speak English or not. If chil-
dren of immigrants arc not given an 
equal opponunity to succeed at the 
academic level, their chances of be-
coming successful members of so-
ciety is seriously limiled. We can· 
not forget that most of these students 
who are studying both their indi-
vidual cultures and the " American" 
culture today. will be productive 
citizens of the United States in the 
global market tomorrow. If we are 
in the position to suppon, even in 
the face of dwindling resources, an 
education that is beneficial to all 
who participate in iI, we must pro· 
vide it without hesitation , if not 
without complaint.

Although Atkinson said that 
one-third of all fee increases go 
back into financial aid, the univer-
sity leaders were skeptical that 
higher education would emerge 
from the financial-aid cuts un· 
scathed.

"The middle class is being 
squeezed out of education oppor-
tunities," he added. 

SDSU President Thomas Day 
agreed the cuts would make higher 
education more difficult to attain, 
a shift which he said could under· 
mine U.S. competitiveness. 

"The need for the best minds 
increases all the time," said Day. 
"There is a national interest in 
funding these students, otherwise 
the nation suffers enormously." 

Atkinson agreed the situation 
does not bode well for UCSD stu-
dents. "We have over 7,000 stu-

cuts ... by an average ofS 1 ,000 per 
student, • said Atkinson. "The in-
debtedness that oocurs is really 
qui te significant." 

Over SO,OOO UC students and 
65,000 CSU students had their loan 
interest deferred last year through 
the subsidized Stafford program. 
According to the UC Student As-
sociation, the subsidy elimination 
would cost the average student 
lender an additional $S,35O for a 
four-year education. 

Rep. BobFilner,D-Chula Vista, 
said that eliminating subsidized 
loans would force "many to make 
tough choices between eating and 
keeping their loans current. The 
cuts in financial aid are just the 
latest in a series of attacks on work-
ing families." 

According to Rep. Brian 
Bilbray, R-San Diego, however, 
support for financial aid cuts is not 
a partisan issue. 

"The many so-called' cuts' Re-
publicans are being assailed over 
are cuts endorsed in President 
Clinton's budget," stated Bilbray. 

Bilbray has not taken a specific 
position on the pending financial-
aid proposals.

Loan Cuts Could Affect 
Thousands of Students 

With 75 percent of all financial 
aid provided by the federal aovem-
ment, ~ss' proposed cuts could 
have dire consequences for the UC 
system, according to a recent UC 
Student Association (UCSA) report. 

The UCSA estimates that the pr0-
posed financial aid cuts could affect 
almost one-third of all UC students. 

Eliminating the subsidized 
Stafford Loans would affect more 
than 51,000 students systemwide, 
who receive average loans of $4,100. 
!f this loan is not subsidized, the 
lender would owe an additional 
$5,350 in accrued interest upon 
graduation four years later, the re-
port states. 

Phasing out the College Work-
Study program would affect 10.000 
UC students. 600 of whom are UCSD 
students. With the systemwide aver-
age award standing at $1,700, the 
UCSA wams that lost revenues would 
force more students to take out 
unsubsldized loans. 

Perkins Loans are also jeopar-
dized by Congress' proposals. Cur-
rently. new Perkins Loans are issued 
with the money received from other 
Perkins Loan payments. Congress is 
hoping to reroute that money back 
into the general economy.

Long Beach Mines Triton Gold In Four SLUGGERS: Four out of six wins 
ContInued froM .... 14 
road victory over sec. 

ByJeremyM ......... 
StaffWrlter 

While everyone else was enjoy-
ing a week of rest and relaxation 
over spring break, the UCSD vol-

leyballteam had its 
hands full, traveling 
north for two 
matches against Pa-
cific University and 
the fourth-ranked 
Stanford Cardinal. 

The Tritons 
struggled through 
the weekend 

matches, losing both contests in 
straight sets to drop their record to 

0-14 in league competition - with 
the squad still on the hunt for a 
league victory. 

Friday night's match pitted the 
two teams stuck on bottom of the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
standings, UCSD (1-17, 0-15) and 
the Pacific Tigers (2-13, 6-13). 

UCSD did its best to stay close 
with the Tigers, as Triton setters 
George You and Satao Minami 
spread the ball all over the floor. As 
a result, five different Triton play-
ers tallied double figures in kills. 

Senior floor leader Tyson Kerr, 
the leading vote getter in the MPSF 
ptayer-of-the-year fan balloting, led 

the squad with 17 kiDs, while Jun-
ior Matt Minehan converted on over 
50 percent of his hits. But despite 
the Tritoni' c;fforts, the match turned 
into a showcase for Paciflc:'s Greg 
Wakeham, who notched a career-
high 41 kills to lead his team to a 
IS-8, 15-9, 15-13 victory. 

On Saturday, the Triton 
volleyballen got another shot at 
their nemesis, fourth-ranked 
Stanford. Hoping to put together an-
other miracle upset against the Car-
dinal, as they did earlier in a pre-
season tournament, the Tritons were 
instead taken to school by the highly 
touted squad and its All-American 

Mike Lambert. 
With. match-high 16 kills to go 

along with eight blocks and six digs, 
Lambert led a strong offensive bar-
rage. Stanford dominated the match, 
winning 15-4, IS-3,IS-6. The over-
matched Tritons were outblocked 
16-4, and compiled a hitting per-
centage of only .013 - compared 
to Stanford's .429 mark. 

UCSD returned back to South-
ern California for a league match 
with the Long Beach State 4gers. 
Despite putting in a solid effort and 
battling with the 49crs, UCSD again 
came up short in a four-set defeat, 
IS-S, 13-1S, IS-8, IS-l. 

This time, UCSD pitcher Mike 
Bryant (2-0) wu masterful, giv-
ing up a lone hit in five innings. 

Bryan Mullin came out of the 
bullpen to keep the zeros on the 
scoreboard for the Tritons, pitch-
ing three scoreless innings. Junior 
hurler Ben Mangan put the nail in 
the coffin, pitching a "three up-
three down" ninth. 

Centerfielder Jason Aguilar 
and junior Bobby Arban added 
offense - Aguilar had two hits, 
including a triple, while Arban 
chipped in two hits of his oWL

Men 's Lacrosse 

"We played a 
solid game," Triton 
team member Dave 
Pogrel said. "But 
because of a lack of 
practice over spring 
break, we weren 't 
as polished as we 
normally are." 

Chuck ~/GuMII." 

It was a different 
story for UCSD on 
ils home soil 
against LMU, two 
days later. The Tri-
tons got goals from 
Kappler, Pakter and 
Stewart as well as 
three scores from 
Lee en route to a 
crushing eight-
point win. In addi-
tion, Pogrel 
knocked in two 
goals, with Cook 
and Brent 
Hilsabeck adding

The Triton men's lacrosse team 

experienced mixed fortunes over 
the spring vacation. A superb 19-

11 victory over 

'-

Loyola 
Marymount on 

Saturday came on 
the heels of a surpris-

ing 10-8 defeat at 
Chapman last Thursday. 

Despite a trio of goals from Jae 
Lee, David Pakter and James

from Brad Cook and captain Ben 
Stewart; and • standout perfor-
mance by goalie Shen Oyang, 
UCSD was unable to overcome 
the Panthers. 

one apiec:e. 
"We beat 'em the whole way 

through," Stewart said. "The loss to 
Chapman showed that we had to 
work harder and come together as a 
team. We proved that we could do 
it on Saturday." 

As far as the remainder of the 
regular season is concerned, the Tri-
tons - despite the defeat - look 
likely to garner a play-off berth. 

"We've had a really good season, 
even though we got a little mentally 
relaxed over the break. After this 
victory, we're looking to play the 
rest of the season with a very posi-
tive attitude," Stewart said.

A See-Saw Spring Break 
DOWNED: Men's tennis starts out strong, but wilts in the Arizona heat 
IIJ HIiMy Somers 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
had reason to enjoy its week off dur-
ing finals after demolishing the Uni-
. ... . versity of Den-

ver, 6-1, on 
Mlrch 17, 

Mike Wilson 
teamed up with 
Frank Heeb in 
the number-two 
doubles slot to 
hammer their op-
ponents, 8-4. The 
number-three 
doubles duo of 

Emil Mihet and Ari Markin also 
mopped up an easy 8-2 win. 

UCSD captured every singles 
match of the dlY. Number-three 
Heeb added to the rout with his best 
match of the season, 6-2, 6-3. Mike 
Wilson, playing in the number-four 
spot, recorded a 6-1, 6-1 beating. 

After a short break from compe-
tition for finals, the Tritons were 
back on the courts and ready to play 
during spring break. 

The first battle was an epic, five-
hour affair against Lewis and Clark 
on March 28. When the dust had 
cleared, UCSD walked away with a 
hard-fought 4-3 victory. 

In doubles,Lewis and Clark 
came out running, stealing two of 
the three mltches. UCSD's number-
two tandem of Wilson and Heeb did 
its part, however, winning 8-6. 

The Tritons came up big in 

. 

singles play with 
some unexpected 
heroics. Number-
six Ping Yeh had 
the match of the 
day, winning a 
grueling match 
with a third-set, 
tie-breaker score 
of 10-8. 

Robby Ho 
sealed the victory 
with a 7-5 win at 
the number-one 
slot, while Dan 
Brounstein and 
Heeb won at the 
number-two and 
three slots to con-
tribute for UCSD. 

The men then 
traveled to Ari-
zona last weekend 
to square off 
against the 
nation's toughest 
Division III 
teams. The Tri-
tons were unable to repeat their per-
formances in the SO-degree heat, 
losing to UC Santa Cruz, 7-0, to 
start the weekend. 

Next up for the Tritons was 
Gustavus Adolphus College. Things 
didn't get much better, as they were 
defeated, 6-1. However, Brounstein 
was the man of the day in both 
doubles and singles, winning 8-6 
and 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, respectively. 

The nightmare wasn't quite over 

Julie Munltenn.,,/~ 

for UCSD, since it still had to play 
both Trinity and Cllremont the very 
next day. 

Trinity came out with confi-
dence, steam rolling the tired Tri-
tons, 7-0. The Arizona trip ended 
with. heartbreaking loss against 
Cllremont College. Wilson, Mihet 
and Yeh came up big for UCSD with 
some solid wins, but it WIS not 
enough to compensate for the Tri-
ton losses.

140-slope Coto de 
Cua course - I 
name which Triton 
Head Coach Mike 
Wydra says is 
"Splnish for ' get 
the hell out of here; 

it's too tough for you. '" 
No, the Triton golfers also had 

to worry about dueling 
groundskeepers, who had differ-
ent opinions on where to place the 
holes. With one working in yards, 
and the other dealing strickly in 
feel, the actual holes ended up "on 
top of anthills," according to 
Wydra. 

And if that weren't bad 
enough, because the 18th hole was 
washed out by rain, one hole had 
to be played twice - a dubious 
decision that created an ll-group 
wait It one point in the tourney. 

Nevertheless, UCSD battled 
out. fairly impressive 311-315-
306 total during the two-day af-
fair. Torn Brown, Triton co-cap-
tain, rattled off a fifth-place 70-79-
74 to lead aU UCSD individuals. 

"If [Brown] shot a double-
eagle on a hole, he'd still be dis-
appointed," Wydra said. "That's 
the kind of competitor he is." 

Pete Roberts, the Triton num-
ber-two man, shot an 79-76-77 de-
spite playing with constant pain in 
his ailing wrists. 

"[Roberts I still needs surgery, 
but he's holding out until the end 
of the season," Wydra said. "He's 
the walking wounded. He's a won-
derful athlete for our team." 

The third-place individual fin· 
isher for UCSD was Arnie 
Campbell, who shot an 82-79-78 
on the course. Having a tough 
time, Campbell hit a "hockey 
stick" on one hole- golfing lingo 
for a seven-stroke score. 

"In golf, you can't bear to ut-
ter anything over six, so if you 
shoot a seven, iI's called a ' hockey 
stick, '" Wydra said. "If you shoot 
an eight on a given hole, it's called 
a 'snowman. ,It 

Alex Behrend wa.~ the Tritons' 
fourth fi nisher, notching an 80-84-
77 overall total. Wydra said that 
Behrend, disappointed with his 
early high scores, "lit I fire under-
neath himself at the end." 

Jim O'Grady WIS the final 
scorer for UCSD, grabbing an 87-
81-82 two-day total. 

"We' re coming on strong," 
Wydra said. "lOrn very pleased."

DAN KRAFT 

Hoop Dreams 
In So Cal 

It has come to my allention 
that some students believe this 
column is used simply for the 
expression of personal 
opinions that have absolutely 
no factual basis. Those people 
are absolutely correct. What I 
write in this column goes 
completely unedited. 

Checkmate: State, 11·8 

If I so desired, I could use it 
as a personal platform for 
violent reform, verbal assaults 
or simply talking about weak 
"sports" like ping pong. 

But I won't. Instead, 
today 's column is dedicated to 
the resurgence of basketball in 
southern California. II was 
little more than a year ago that 
the outlook was at its bleakest: 

AZTEC KED: Tritons 
suffer second loss of 
the season to SDSU 
By DM Sweeney 
Senior Staff Writer 

Going into yesterday'S game 
against San Diego State at 
Canyonview, the USA National 

Champion UCSD 
women's water 
polo teantJmew it 
was in for a tough 
battle. 

Head Coach 
Denny Harper's 
crew had already 
faced the Aztecs 
twice this season, 
edging the cross-

town rivals 8-7 in the first contest 
before losing 6-7 in the sequel. 

Nationally ranked UCLA was 
ousted, yet again, in the first 
round of the NCAAs, raising 
serious questions about the 
coaching competency of Jim 
Harrick - a man who was 
compared by many a sports 
writer to the winless coach of 
the Globetrollers pitiful foes, 
the Washington Generals. 

Wednesday, SDSU made it two 
in a row, parlaying strong defense 
with streaky scoring en route to a 
11-8 conquest. 

The Triton offense came up short yestenlay, racld", up elJllt eoals aaainst a touJII SDSU defense. 

Meanwhile, the Lakers 
were wallowing in mediocrity 
and missed the playoffs for the 
first time in recent memory. 
While Harrick was reemed for 
being unable to put together a 
winner with his plethora of 
talent, the Lak#:r coaches had 
no such concerns. Their lineup 
was dotted with such names as 
James "Which team am I on 
now?" Edwards, Anthony 
"slipped on a banana" Peeler 
and James "no longer" Worthy. 
The L.A. hoops tradition 
seemed to be fading at Indy car 
speed. 

Oh, what a difference a year 
makes. With the Bruins' ascent 
to the NCAA pinnacle and the 
Lakers return from the dead in 
the stacked Pacific Division, 
the turnaround has been quick 
and complete. Harrick has 
emerged from the valley of the 
shadow (of big tourney 
chokes) and has stepped into 
the blazing sun of victory. 

The Lakers have properly 
retired the James brothers, and 
youngsters such as Peeler, 
Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones 
have leapt to the forefront , 
leading L.A. back to the 

. promised land that we call the 
NBA playoffs. 

It was the Tritons (8-2) that drew 
first blood when a Julie Swail shot 

found the back of the cage to give 
the home team an early 1-0 advan-
tage. State refused to fold, however, 

rise to the occasion, forcing UCSD 
into consecutive shot clock viola-
tions while the offense produced 
another goal. 

UCSD has lost two of three from the Aztecs. 

countering with 
three quick goals of 
its own, which 
vaulted the team 
ahead, 3-1 - a lead 
which was never re-
linquished. 

After the adver-
saries traded goals, 
the first quarter 
came to a close with 
the Aztecs clinging 
to a 4-2 advantage. 

The beginning 
of the second period 
saw the SDSU 
swarming defense 

Finally, Shawna Caballero broke 
the drought w.ith the second of her 
three goals, a mortar shot from the 
right side which found its way past 
a frozen Aztec goalie. 

However, State matched the goal 
to close the half with a 6-3 edge. 
After some inspirational words from 
Harper, the Tritons came back in the 
third, outscoring their rivals, 4-2. 

Kelly Gilbreth netted the first 
goal, which was followed by a gor-
geous lob shot by Jennifer Payne 
from the right wing. Again, SDSU 
was able to match UCSD with two 
of its own. 

Hawaii 5-0 Squad Hangs 1\vo 
WAVES: Tritons roll over Concordia College and sec 
By Sean Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

The baseball strike is finally over, and the 
real baseball players are coming back to play. 
But who really cares? After all, the UCSD 

~m 
• BRLL~ 

baseball team is on a roll, 
winning four of its last six 
games - including two 
straight shutouts. 

Coming into this week's 
road games versus 
Concordia (on Monday) 
and Southern California 
College (on Wednesday), 
the UCSD sluggers' mo-

during Monday 's game against Concordia 
College. In particular, the UCSD pitching 
staff came through in a biS way with a solid 
5-0 shutout. . 

Starting pitcher Marc Abrams (2-0) be-
gan the game and pitched magnificently to 
pick up his second win of the season. Abrams 
pitched seven scoreless innings, relying on 
his nasty curveball to compliment his blis-
tering fastball. Andy DeGrasse followed in 
Abrams' footsteps, pitching a flawless eighth 
inning, and Theo Robbins cleaned things up 
in the ninth to preserve the Triton victory. 

The Triton pitching perfection did not 
stop there, though. The UCSD hurlers were 
at it again on Wednesday, recording their sec-
ond shutout of the week with another 5-0 

The comeback was far from 
quelled. Swail struck again with a 
powerful "can ' t-touch-this" skip 
shot on a fast break. 

Seconds later, a Coreen 
Lightfoot steal and a Dana Byrd 
goal brought UCSD within one, 8-
7. That would be it, however, as the 
Aztecs went on another three-goal 
run which established a stable, four-
goal lead. A late garbage-time goal 
by Caballero closed out the scoring. 

"We were a little sluggish in the 
first half," Harper said. "We looked 
more like ourselves when we 
brought it back to 8-7, and then we 
made some basic errors. 

"We'll let [SDSUI enjoy their 
little moment in the sun before we 
play them again." 

So boys and girls, today's 
lessons goes as follows: first, 
this column is what I want it to 
be. Second, don 't underesti-
mate the power of tradition 
when it comes to the old, 
Angelian court dynasties.

Eric 
Bogosian 
brings his 
vitriol to 

Playhouse 
n many ways, Eric Bogosian 's 
acerbic work appears to be di-
rected at stereotypes of Ameri-
can culture. He makes fun of 
American infatuations with 
rock 'n ' roll and the '60s in his 
performance pieces "Talk Ra-
dio" (which Oliver Stone 
turned into a film) and "Sex, 
Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll ." But 
during a recent phone inter-

view from his rehearsal studio in 
New York, Bogosian stressed that 
his monologues are not directed at 
cultural issues, but at his own fears 
and desires. Bogosian will present 
his latest piece, "Pouilding Nails 
in the Floor with My Forehead," in 
three performances on Friday and 
Saturday at the La Jolla Playhouse.

Bogosian: It's not really about 
anything. I cover a lot of different 
territory in the course of it, and I 
play differentcharacters. My show 
is high energy. U's stuff that makes 
me laugh, excites me and turns me 
on. Parts of it are kind of violent 
and parts are sexually oriented. I 
walk out on that stage at 8:05, and 
I start to kick ass and I don't stop 
until 9:35. That's what my show 
is. 
Are you •••• for any ..... 
tic:ua. sac:iIII tarpts1 

No. I aim for me-what I'm 
afraid of, what I fantasize about, 
what turns me on, what turns me 
off. The whole idea of being a 
critic or critiquing the world at 
large is kind of dumb. I'll let Gar-
rison Keillor take care of that. I 
make shows about what's going 
on with me. If I'm playing a guy 
who is kind of a biker dope-deaIer, 
then maybe there was some point 
in my life when I wish I could have 
been that. I'm not that, butlliketo 
go visit that place. 

I think everybody has a lot of 
different parts to them. There' 5 the

Grant Lee BaH., wit open for the eranberrle •• 

Grant Lee Buffalo 
Trio focuses its sound on new album 

By Jeff Nlnel 
Hiatus Editor 

When Grant Lee Buffalo released 
its first album, Fuzzy, in 1993, the Los 
Angeles-based trio essentially com-
piled songs it had recorded since 
singer-guitarist Grant lee Phillips 
began working with drummer Joey 
Peters in 1986. On its follow-up al-
bum, Mighty Joe Moon, the band, 
which opens for the CraAber-

less explicitly political than Fuzzy, 
which includes a song about the LA. 
riots. On Mighty Joe Moon, songs 
such as "Mockingbird, "thefirstsingle, 
deal with personal relationships more 
than political issues. 

One constant is Phillips ' soaring 
vocals and the band's folk-inflected 
music, both of which have a distinc-
tive, eerie quality. A certain sadness 

ries Saturday at 8 p.m. at 
RIMAe, sounds more fo-
cused. 

"Mighty Joe Moon is a 
more cohesive record, -bass-
ist Paul Kimble said during a 
recent phone interview. 
Kimble also produced both 
Fuzzy and Mighty. 

MUS I C 
~ ......-:~ 

pervades the songs on 
Mighty, even ,the track en-
titled "Happiness." 

"That ['Happiness'] is 
definitely a sad song. I don't 
know that I've ever liked 
anything that was overtly 
happy," Kimble said. .. ~~ 

"I really like both albums for dif-
ferent reasons. Fuzzy was more all 
over the map stylistically. I think the 
songs fit together okay, but I think the 
identity of the band changed from one 
song to the next I don't think that was 
as apparent on Mighty Joe Moon." 

Although it still draws on refer-
ences to American history, the lyrical 
content of Mighty Joe Moon is also 

"I don't really like Im-
pressionist paintings. They seem kind 
of vacuous to me," he continued. "I 
don't necessarily like films like 
Forrest Gump, either. 

"When you're happy, you spend a 
lot less time thinking about what you're 
doing. When you're depressed or sad 
or don't think things are right, you 
tend to be more analytical. I think that 
state is more of a breeding ground for 
creativity. "

Don Juan DeMarco 
Cast can't save film s muddled mix 

of comedy and romance 
By DI8M Reynol8 
GuardlBn'Reporter 

DonJUIlII de MfUCo, with an all-
starcastwhich includesJohMY Depp, 
Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway, 
is sure to attract audiences based on its 
actors alone. Unfortunately, such tal-
ent fails to save the plot, a potentially 
rich combination of erotic adventure, 
psycho-drama and situation comedy, 
which, in the end, can only be de-
scribed as a jumbled mess. 

The film opens with a young man 

(Depp) bal.nced on a billboard high 
above the street. Dressed in 17th-
century costume, with sword and 
mask, he claims to be Don Juan, the 
world's greatest lover and seducer of 
over a thousand women. In spite of all 
his conquests, however, he has lost 
his one true love and wishes to die. 

As the crowd gathers, the police 
call in Dr. Jack Mickler (Brando), a 
tired, overweight and aging psychia-
trist, who succeeds in bringing the 
jumper down. Don Juan is committed

In his counseling sessions, Don Juan

de MfUCO is fuU of promise 
but fails to deliver. It could 
have been an erotic adven-
IIRmovie, but Ifter a steamy 
(as well as interesting) 
opener, it sinks to the level of 
bedroom comedy with Don 
Juan hiding in cupboards or 

young man from his col-
leagues, who continue to be-

Knowing his colleagues will 
disagree with his evaluation and un-
able to "cure" the delusions, Mickler 
must also arrange a way for Don Juan 
to be released after the 1 O-da y evalu-
ation period.

Along the way, Miclder is forced 
to confront his own life, long void of 

sneaking into bedrooms. 
DonJU/JII also could have been a 

psychlHirama focusing on the inten-
sity of tile relationship between thera-
pist and patient. One scene, in which 
Mickler accuses Don Juan of sup-
pressing knowledge of his mother's

affairs, is particularly effective. The 
problem of Don Juan's delusions, (is 
he really Don Juan, or just a kid from 
Queens who fantasizes about 
centerfold models?) creales a psycho-
logical mystery that Mickler is forced 
10 unravel. 

Finally, the film could have had a 
deeper confrontation with Mickler's 
fear of aging, but seuJes for a sani-
tized rebirth of his libido. In spite of 
a strong performance by Depp, and 
some good moments from Branda 
(who occasionally forgets his psy-
chiatrist role and slips into his tough-
guy lisp), the film suffers from a lack 
of courage to see any ofthese interest-
ing themes through to their culmina-
tion. This weird combination of Prince 
0{ Tides and Beach Blanket Bingo 
tries to do too much.
