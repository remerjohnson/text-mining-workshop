UCB detnonstrates 
against Reagan 

BERKELEY (AP) -
Campus police hauled 
dis idents from the UC 
Berkeley administration 
building last night, 
breaking up a sit· in that 
began as a protest against 
Ronald Reagan but drifted 
into support of several 
campus causes. 

About 70 students and 
non students had been 
threatened with arrest if 
they did not leave 
voluntarily. When they 
made no move, campus 
officers commenced remov· 
ing the dissidents, some of 
whom went limp and were 
dragged down the stairwell 
they had occupied five 
hours. 

Even then, the protestors 
were told they could avoid 
arrest if they would just 
walk away. It was not 
immediately known how 
many elected to be arrested. 

Inside the building, the 
demonstrators chanted 
defiance, but a reporter said 
he observed no violence, 

About 150 demonstra· 
tors, at first reported to be 
protesting a possible draft 
and angered by Reagan 's 
presiden t ial elect ion, 
originally moved into the 
campus administration 
building. But after two 
earlier arrests, some 
dissidents started drifting 
away , 

The building occupation 
began at about 2 pm at a 
campus rally "to build an 
educat ional movement " 
against Reagan, who wa 
elected president Tue. day, 
according to a rally act ivi t. 

Campus spokesman Ray 
Colvig identified the two 
people arrested earlier as 
non student Thomas 
Brunner, 27, Bolina , 

~ked for investigation of 
Interfering with a police 
officer and disturbing the 

peace; and graduate tuoent 
Howard Besser, 28, booked 
on cou nt of delaying a 
policeman and di turbing 
the peace. 

The arrests were made by 
campus police who have full 
law enforcement authority, 
Colvig said. Besser bailed 
himself out immediately. 

A reporter inside the 
building with the dissidents 
said, among other things, 
they were protesting the 
campus ROTC military 
training office and univers· 
ity support of government· 
sponsored nuclear weapons 
research, and were 
supporting campus chi ld 
care and Third World 
studies. 

He said some of the 
demonstrators were pass· 
i n g 0'\J t Com m u n i s t 
literature. 

All were demanding that 
the charges against the two 
arrested men be dropped, he' 
said . 

Student Theresa Clarke, 
among three people who 
spoke with campus vice 
chancellor Robert Kerley in 
the building, said the 
elect ion of Reagan as 
president was the "cata· 
Iyst" that started the 
demonstrat ion. 

The en t ria n c e in to 
California Hall occurred 
after several hundred 
people rallied and marched 
from Sproul Hall - ite of 
many anti·draft rallie in 
the late ]960s and early -
1970s - chanting " Hey hey, 
ho ho, ROTC ha got to go." 

Inside the 'bu i Iding, 
uniformed police and some 
officers in plainclothe ,kept 
an eye on the group. 

Earlier at Sproul Plaza, 
speakers had exhorted the 
crowd to "make ure 
Reagan can do as little as 
possible to hinder human 
rights in the country." 

Kernell offers election outcome 
views in 'Morning After' lecture 

BY JONATHAN KROLL 
The election of Ronald 

Reagan was more an 
expression of the electorate's 
dislike for President Carter's 
performance than it wa an 
approval of Reagan's 
conservative policies, said 
Sam Kernell , UCSD profes· 
sor of political cience 
yesterday. 

In his lecture, " What 
Happened Last Night : A 
Morning·After Look at the 
Elections," Kernell offered 
his explanation of Reagan 's 
landslide victory over the 
President , and told why the 
public polls had not predicted 
it. Sixty students, faculty , 
and staff attended the lecture 
in the stu dent center 
conference room. 

Kernell described tho e 
events of the last week of the 
campaign which he believes 
led to Carter's resounding 
defeat. 

"After the debate the polls 
gave Reagan a three to four 
percent lead , but by the 
weekend the election looked 
like a toss·up," he said. 
"Then on Sunday night 
things began to change 
rapidly," he continued . 

By Monday a poll 
conducted by Carter's 
per onal pollster showed that 
support for the President had 
s lipped by 10%, said Kernell . 

It was apparent to Carter 
at this point that he would 
lose the el tion, Kernell 
added. . 

During the last day ' before 
th e election. Kernell 
hypothesized, the undecided 
electorate weighed President

Carter's dismal record 
against the risks of electing 
Reagan. 

"The voters were in a 
dilemma. They had a choice 
between two unpopular 
candidates," he said. 

They resolved this dilemma 
by repudiating the Carter 
administration, Kernell said. 
Only 2] percent of the 
American pu blic approved of 
Carter's performance prior to 
the election. This percentage 

of pre idential approval i the 
lowest in Gallup poll hi tory, 
even below that recorded for 
President Nixon ju t prior to 
his resignation. 

Fort he pre idential debate, 
the candidates' "liabilities

aid Kernell ." The outcome

Vegetables' needs 
neglected too long 
Editor: 

Regarding an article which 
never appeared in the Oct. 7 
(or any other) issue of The 
Daily Guardian concerning 
the public apathy toward 
affirmative action programs 
for seve rl y mentally 
handicapped persons, 
commonly called "vegeta-
bles" (in collOQuial u e): We 
feel that the elf-actualized 
needs of thi s socia lly 
ostracized and outcasted 
class of mental imcompetent 
have been grossly neglected . 
This sociaJ injustice must be 
att ended to! We feel that 
vegetables have as much 
right to an education a 
anyone else - in fact , they 
probably have greater, if 
more difficult , educational 
needs. 

slmpl:cl!y 01 \o\o hlCh they are 
capable brings them much 
enjoyment. We believe that 
more special programs and 
more federal funding would 
enable these malfort unates 
to xp rience the arne 
benefits of a college education 
as anyone else, benefit s that 
are current ly being subsi -
dized for other classes of 
poor, oppres ed minority

Most people unjus tl y 

assume that vegetables are 
incapable of the joys of

learning) merely 'because 
they are devoid of detectable

certainly unjustified, if not 
false! How many of you really

the government has for so 
long ignored the vegetable 
problem, and why it has been 
kept out of the press. We feel 
that a truly enlightened,

would take action on these 
types of problems. "What can 
I do?" you are probably 
asking yourself. You can

Election analyzed 
t:ontin ued from pa~e 1 

In the debate, Carter tried 
to di s tinguish himself as a 
ma in s tr eam De moc rat 
running against a righi -wing 
Republican , said Kernell . 
The Pres ident suggested that 
the nation's problem s were 
not hi s fault and that there 
are no simple solutions. He 
port ra yed Reagan as a 
dange rous wa rmonge r . 
someone "who shoots from 
the hip," sa id Kernell . 

Cart er hoped the pu blic 
woul d choo. e "an unpleafianl 
kn o wn in s t ea d of a n 
un pleasa nt u nknow n ," 
Kern II added. 

Reagan presen ted himself 
as a s tabl , re pon. ibl man, 
a man who loves peace, not 
war, Kernell said . 

" Reagan's war-li ke image. 
fost e red by t he Ca rt er 
ca mpaign was easier to dispel 
than was Carter' , image of 
incomp tence," 

Kern II ex pl ained that the 
nagging fea r people had 
about Reagan were more 
eas ily alleviated than was the 
dissati s faction people felt for 
Carter' s performance. 

" Publi c di approv al of 
Carter wa so d p- eated 
and long-s tanding that it 
could not be dispelled during 
one and one-hal f hours of 
debate, " explained Kernell . 

Some people had thought 
the near-resolut ion of the 
hostage crisis just before the 
election wou ld generate votes 
for Carter, but thi 
apparently was not the case, 
Kernell added . 

Kernell concluded that the 
election was a rejection of the 
President's administration 
rather than overwhelming 
approval of Reagan. 

''I'm convinced t hat it was 
a negative judgement of 
Carter, a repudiation of his 
performance," he said . "The 
people did not vote for the 
future a much a. they voted 
agai nst the,past." 

Kernell predicted thai 
Reaga n 's elect ion tot he 
presiden cy will provide 
momentum for the Repu blic-
an party, providing "a morale 

booster for Republican offin' 
holders." Aft hough Kern('11 
beliel'es the eleci ion was nOI 
a major a ffi r mat ion 01 
Reaga n 's poli c ies, "t hl' 
magnitude of Ihe land :i lidt, 
will inspire I<onald Reagan 
and his support ers. He wil l 
int erpret it as a mandate and 
vindi cat ion for a ll hi , 
beliefs," said Kernel!. 

During a que: t ion and 
a nswe r p ri od Kernel l 
att acked the primar~' fiyst m 
of ca ndidate selection. 

"Primaries are an art ificl al 
and un fo rt unale' way til 
choose ca ndidates . MllI' l' 
people participated in thl ' 
presidentia l elec tion than 
ev r before and yet I\'e ended 
up with two le:s than optimal 
'hoi 'es," he said. 

Kern ell ca lled for the' 
eli mi nation of the primarie, 
and t he reform of t hl' 
con l'entio n sl'stem. He 
supports a sy~tem in which 
"people and pvl it ical panics 
cou ld choose th most 
acceptable cand idates and 
the ones mos t likely to wi n." 

Professors at haniel Beck 
and Gary j acobson , also 
members of the poli tical 
sc ience department here, 
attended the lecture and 
an wered some que tions. 

jacobson commented on 
the success of t h Repu bllcan 
Party in selecting s trong, 
conservative congre s ion al 
candidates to oppo 'e liberal 
Democratic incumbents. He 
attributed their 'uccess to 
their early selection and 
exten ive campaign fund '. 

Kernell' s lecture was the 
second in a erie titled 
"Adventure in R ~ earch." 
The series, designed to 
acquaint the campus and the 
community with some of the 
research being don e at 
LJCSD. is sponsored by the 
Council of Provosts , Third 
Coll ege and the Publi c 
In format ion Office. 

The next and final lecture 
is "Christma. in November: 
A Light -hearted Look at 
Holida y Ent ertainm e nl 
Through the Centuries, " to 
be given by Drama Professor 
Eric Christmas on No\·. 26.

Lack of business plagues 
General Store, future unsure 

Low prices do not attract patrons 
BY STEVE GOLDSTICK 

After six weeks of 
operation. The General tore 
is not doin~ the kind of 
business it needs to ustain 
itself. 

"We will not be able to stay 
open if bu iness keeps up the 
way it is now." ays General 
Store manager Bob Corlew. 

Corlew understands it 
takes time for a busine 
operation to establi h it elf, 
but doesn't know why people 
buy items that cost less at the 
General Store at more 
eXjlensive local retailers. 

Those customers that do 
walk into the store, though, 
seem pleased with the diverse 
inventory the store offers and 
the prices the store sets, 
Corlew says. The problem is 
making people aware that the 
General Store is here, he 
believes. 

"Some people forget we 
exist and some people just 
plain don't know we exist at 
all," says Corlew. 

Inflation 

One regular customer told 
The Daily Guardiau : "l like 
the Gen ral tore becau 'e it 
offers an alternative to the 
bookstore." 

As to why more people 
don't know or remember the 
existence of the s tore, 
another customer offers an 
explanation: ''This place 
needs omething that people 
can ident ify with .... if they 
need a particular item. they 
will be able to rememberthey 
saw it for s ale in the General 
Store." 

Many of the practical 
necessities required for 
school life can be found in the 
store at considerably reduced 
prices. 

Among the e item are 
pens, which ell for 13<r at the 
General Store and at least 
twice that much at the 
University Bookstore. Also, 
toothbrushes, which sell for 
79¢ at the bookstore, are only 
2l<X at the General Store.

"While we can't buy items

them in small quantity, we 
keep them cheaper t han most

'ay . 

Yet students urpri ' d 
Morey Feldman, general 
advisor to the General Store. 
with a rcaue t for the 
sacrifice of low prices for 
higher quality merchandi 'e, 
'pecifically in tape recorders. 

The f ut ure of the General 
tore. located behind 

A.S.sorted Vinyl in the 
tudent Center, is uncertain 

at this point. Corlew states 
that "we can go on like thi 
for about six more mont hs. 
but if business doesn't pick 
up after that. we will not be 
able to stay open." 

The General Store is open 
from I I am to 4 pm Monday

Khomeini's leader hip. 

Perhap it i po ible. then, 
to account for this unique 
response to Iraqi aggression 
as a pecial case, reflecting 
Iran 's u ' ual degree of 
isolation in the international 
communitiy. 

Sure Khomeini's interna· 
t ional unpopularity is a 
factor. but it is not the whole 
story. The United Slates has 
been moving increasingly. 
since the fall of the hah . 
toward claiming for itself a 
unilateral right to use force to 
sa feguarci the oil lifeline of 
t he West. Such a claim 
underlies the announced 
function of the I{apid 
Deployment Force. In other 
words. even the United 
Stat es - for so long I he great 
champion of alit lawing 
aggres"ion - seems to be 
preparing the grourMI for its 
own fut ure aggressin:' USt' of 
f( )I'll' . 

rr this is so, we are slipping 
back to the dangerous 
diplomacy of the late 19th 
century. when the maneu-
vers of the big powers in the 
Balkans unraveled "the' 
balance" and produced World 
War l. 

But there is oil in the 
foreground, making even 
risk ' of nu lear war seem 
remote and abstract.
