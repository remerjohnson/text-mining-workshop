Fall Orientation Issue 
By the beginning of next week, more than 
10, 000 students will have descended upon 

UCSD, bringing the summer here to an end.

similar to the one that arrived in La jolllllost 
fall. The trodemorks of struknt life - stereos,

Atkinson takes over 

Richard Atkinson, a former 
Stanford psychology profes-
sor and National Science 
Fo~ndation director, took 
over the chancellor's office 
July 1. He replaced William 
McElroy, who was forad 
from office due to a conflict 
with the faculty over 
consultation and penonnel 
changes, 

One of Atkinson', respon-
sibilities is to fill the newly 
created position of Vice 
Chancellor of Planning and 
Budget. This poet is an 
outgrowth of the now-
defunct Vice Chancellor of 
Administration office, 
vacated by Bernard Sisco in 
June.

Student entployees of UC can 
join unions, CSEA discovers 

BY JOHN HONDROS 
Students employed by the 

University of California can 
leplly organize into unions 
and have the right to 
collective bargainin~ the 
president of the California 
State Employees Association 
union, Local 104, recently 
learned. 

And UCSD officers for the 
CSEA are now making an 
"active effort" to organize 
working undergraduates at 
this campus into the union, 
acordine to Marco Li Mandri, 
president of the UCSD 
chapter of CSEA. One 
student has signed up with 
the chapter thus far. 

The implications are 
widespread: for example, 

unionized student cafeteria 
workers who are dissatisfied 
with wages or ·working 
conditions have the right to 
strike. 

This indicates a switch for 
students, who will no longer 
be the ones crossing picket 
lines. 

As part of the chapter's 
effort of "set the pace for (the 
unionization of) UC," Li 
Mandri sent a letter last 
month to CSEA's legal 
oounsel asking if students 
were eligible to join CSEA 
and receive the same benefits 
as staff workers. The counsel 
replied that any working 
student paying the $4 
monthly dues is entitled to 
the same benefits -

including dental, automobile 
and homeowner's benefits, as 
well as the right to grieve 
poor working conditions. 

UC Berkeley is the only 
other campus at which CSEA 
is strongly organized . 

Collective barga i ning 
rights were granted to 90,000 
higher education employees 
in California following the 
passage of Assem bly Bill 
1091- known as the Berman 
BiH - in 1978. Collective 
bargaining allows employees 
to mutually determine.the 
terms and conditions of 
employment with their 
employers.

Cloning prof in double trouble, quits 
Reports suggest Kennedy was 
not mistaken in virus identity 

completely in the clear. why 
didn't he report the calls? 

Since Kennedy attributed 
his resignation Friday to 
"irreconcilable differences" 
with UCSD administr-ation 
and staff. he might never say. 

Another twist to the story 
is that the virus Kennedy 
cloned was approved for such 
research July 29, 1980, and 
Kennedy did his cloning work 
in a lab one level higher in 
security clearance than 

necessary. 
There are still loose ends in 

the case: the Biology 
Department has started its 
own investigation, which 
will be completed "in a week 
or two." 

Dr. S . Ian Kennedy 
resigned his tenured 
professorship here Friday, 
adding another twist to a 
summer of confusion over his 
intentions while working in a 
cloning laboratory atop the 
Basic Biology Building at 
Muir. 

essentially a UCSD house 
report, needed further 
investigation. 

The agency has asked 
Kennedy for an explanation 
which he must submit by 
Sept. 29. The NIH will then 
return its own report. 

Fall enrollment unexpectedly 
rises at UCSD, other schools 

Kennedy started work on 
cloning a virus he told his lab 
assistants was Sindbus, an 
approved virus for such 
research. Sometime between 
September of 1979 and April 
of 1980, Kennedy succeeded 
in cloning a virus, but it was 
Semliki Forest, which was 
restricted by the National 
Institutes of Health. 

No one found out about 
what Kennedy claims was an 
honest mistake until four 
graduate students working 
in his lab resigned and went 
to the campus Institutional 
Biosafety COOlmittee with 
their belief that Kennedy was 
engaging in illegal cloning. 

That report concluded that 
"either Dr. Kennedy had 
knowl. of the source and 
the identity of the material 
used, to clone DNA copies of 
Semliki Forest Virus 
defective, interfering RNA, or 
Dr. Kennedy, due to poor 
record keeping or lapse of 
memory, cloned Semliki 
Forect Virus DNA by 
mistake ..... 

The NIH then decided that 
the mc report, which is 

Speculation on campus 
was that that report, if it had 
concluded tha t Kennedy 
knew what he was doing 
when he cloned the virus, 
could have led to a fight over 
the professor's job. 

The notion that the report 
would not reflect well on 
Kennedy was fueled by an 
incident in August. 

Kennedy had been receiv· 
ing phone calls for several 
months accusing him of 
conducti ng dangerous 
experiments and that the 
caller planned to stop him. 
Kennedy told no one about 
the calls, until a virus was 
stolen from his lab over the 
weekend of the 9th and 10th 
of August . 

The caller, who used a key 
that opened several rooms in 
the building as well as 
Kennedy's restricted P-3lab, 
said he thought he had been 
infected by the virus and 
wanted someone to pick it up 
in the stairs of the building. 

That was done with no 
harm. 

But the question around' 
the university was: If

Local politics on 'up-and-out' 
BY MARK STADLER 
The theme b San 0-. 

politicians these days is u~ 
and-out. But San Diego 
politics we .aiD _inas . 
usual as we enter fhe ninth 
decade of the 20th century. 

The local San Dieaoelected 
offices--the City Council and 
County Board of Supervisors-
·have become steppingstones 
in recent years. This is a new 
trend locally; in the past, 
political posts in the city and 
county were dead-end jobs, as 
far as advancement to higher 
office was ooncerned. 

This year, though, no less 
than three City Council 
members and one Supervisor 
took the plunge. Two Council 
members came out success· 
fully: Larry Stirling, who 
qualified for November's 
general election to the state 
Assembly and Bill Lowery, 
who won a nomination for 
Congress. The other two--
Councilman Fred Schnautielt 
and Supervisor Jim Bates--
weren't quite so lucky. 

Why did t his happen? How 
have city and county offices, 
which an supposedly non-
partisan, become spring-
boards to more powerlul jobs 
on the state and federal 
levels? 

To begin with, the jobs 
now pay more. Up until 1972, 
for example, two Council 
members drew only $5,000 
annually; the job wasn't even 
considered fulltime. This 
meant that only the well-to-
do could afford to take the 
positions; everybody else had 
to work for a livina-

Also, as the pay has 
improved,. the power of the 
~uncif and Board of 
Su,ervisors has increased. In 

·pafticular. the City Council 
used to be a rubberstamp for 
the City Manager's office, a 

Commentary 
body that met once a week to 
ratify decisions made by 
professional staff. Now, 
largely through the efforts of 
Mayor Pete Wilson, himself 
an aspirant to higher office--
namely Governor or US 
Senator--the Council has 
become a full-time job with 
much of the power that 
formerly belonged to the 
Manager's office. 

With increased power and 
increased remuneration, 
local electoral posts have 
drawn a wider circle of jo~ 
seekers. Included in this 
"new breed" of San Diego 
politician are the power-
seekers, those who see the 
Council and Board of 
Supervisors as good 
opportunities to build 
support for future elections 
to higher posts. 

. There is certainly nothing 
wrong wit h polit icians 
seeking higher office. or 
building support, or 
gathering power-o at least, not 
until things get out of hand. 

But many local pols who 
are now going after state and 
federal office campaigned by 
sayir.,o{ they weren't pOliti· 
cians at all. No, they were 
just regular guys, like you 

and me and the dude down 
the street. 

All three of the City 
Council members who were 
in elections this year-·which 
is an off-year for the council--
fit into this category_ All are 
in their first terms. And all 
were elected on campaigns 
based on the theme: We're 
conservative Republicans·· 
Schnaubelt called himself a 
Libertarian, but ran for a 
Repu blican nomination in 
June--who are tight-fisted 
with the dollar and who 
aren't politicians. We just 
want to help out the "people" 
wherever they are. 

Then. three years into 
their first terms, these three 
guys went after better jobs. 
What could be more political, 

' especially since they ran 
campaigns while they were 
supposed to be acting as

political" types.

NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 
1980 - The cocktail wait· 
resses at the Waldorf Astoria 
are busy tonight. 

For the last two days 
conventioneers have been 
arriving - delegates from 
California and the Virgin 
Islands; workers for Edward 
Kennedy (whose headquar-
ters is on the 18th floor), the 
anonymous-looking Secret 
Service men in their dark 
three-piece suits, and of 
course. the correspondents 
and technicians from the 
three networks - and 
tonight convention social 
activities officially btain. 

So·the bar is full, even with 
beers cnsting $2.85 each, and 
a standing-roam·only aowd 
fills the lobby. The botel has 
been booked full for months_ 

The scene is the same at all 
of Manhattan's large, 
expensive hotels: at the 
Sheraton Centre is Carter 
headquarters, along with 
delegations from Louisiana, 
Ohio and· Wisc:xJnsin; at tbe 
Summit Hotel are deIep-

tions from five states; and the 
Statler, across -Seventh 
Avenue from Madison 
Square Garden, has been 
taken over by the Democratic 
National Committee. 

By 8 pm most of the 
caucuses (organizational 
meetings for delegate groups) 
are over and the ground floor 
is at peak congestion, filled 
with grinning delegates 
trying to decide where to 
spend their money. 

The convention activity 
does not go on without some 
complaints from the locals 
offended by the out-of-
towners' siege of the area 
surrounding convention 
headquarters. 

Also among the complaints 
were those of reporters 
whom, it seemed, were 
always in line behind a 
network correspondent.

God's Eye: It looks down 
from above the Garden. down 
at the seats of the delegates 
and the alternates, down at

and the Daily Press section,

Convention, and the_eye is 
not really God's but ABC's -
a remote control camera 
looking down from the steel 
rafters above the middle of 
the arena's floor level. The 
camera was nicknamed by 
ABC's technicians only for 
its panoramic view, but the 
ubiquity and power of the 
three big television networks 
at the convention is also 
awesome. 

Combined, NBC, CBS and . 
ABC have at the Garden 76 
cameras, about ' 1.500 
telephoneS and more than 
2,000 emplQyees. When thelle

People seeking to place a

city ballot are thwarted at 
every turn by the city 
bureaucracy and have had to

Those who want to turn the

need from the City Council. 
Striking workers at Ncrth

some say, were a little 'too

And things don't promise 
to get a whole lot better in the 
future. The two most 
interesting elections for the 
fall match up conservatives. 
In the 43rd Congressional

Union 
continued from pap 4 
entitled to these rights until 
Li Mandri received CSEA's 
letter two weeks ago. 

UC President David Saxon 
has indicated since the 
passage of the Berman biB 
that UC's "edu cation 
mission" is "not well served 
through the collective 
bargaining." 

" The fact that this 
legislation has been passed 
does not mean that the UC 
administration will encour-
age the substitution of 
collective bargaining for our 
present program of employee 
relations." Saxon said in a 
press release i sued after the 
bill 's pas age. 

Saxon, who is in Washing-
ton, wa unavailable for 
comment on students' right 
to collective bargaining. 

Under UC's wage policy, 
employees working less than 
19 hours a week are not 
eligible for paid vacation and 
sick leave benefits. However, 
students are not permitted to 
work for the university for 
more than 19 hours a week 
and cannot enjoy these 
benefits. 

"Why can't students work 
more than 19 hours a week: 
because the university 
doeSn't want them to get the 
benefits," Li Mandri said. 
, Students working 10 hours 
a week wouJd quaJity for 
CsEA's benefits, he said. . 

In order to attract students 
to CSEA, the union plan to: 
educate ~tudents on their 
"working rights"; expose the 
health and safety violations 
on campus; and fight for a· 
cost of living W8R'I! ina-ease 
for both student and staff 
workers. (Although UC . 
w8lleS went up 10 pet·cent 
over the summer, the 
inflation in San Diego rose to 
18 percent.) 

CSEA, the lar~t union at 
UCSD, currently has about 
500 members here. 

Enrollment 
coatinued froaa pqe 5 
seven new students from 
outside the San DitWO area 
were denied on· campus 
housirw this faU and were 
referred to the off-campus 
Housing Office, according to 
Assistant Director of 
Housing and Food Services 
Pat Goodstein. 

"This soort. in housi~ 
is unprecedented at UCSD. ' 
she says. "The ina-easing 
costs of transportation. 
utilities and rent are forcing 
more students to apply for on· 
campus housing. It's just 
beyond our ability to find 
spats {or all of them at this 
point. II she explains. 

Approximately 250 new 
apartment units eest of the 
campus wiD be available to 
married students .and ainaIe 
lI'aduate and undelarmu-
atea next y~. Goodstein 
says. but until then. students 
are on their own. 

Despite the unexpected 
enrollment ina_e. Bowker 
..,. students need not worry 
about limited course 
availHility . 

"Althoulh we literally 
build the fan quarter 
lChedule of cJ.nes prior to 
May, when continuin, 
students estroll. we make 
constant adjustment a. 
needed throu,hout the 
summer," he Sl)'S.

No bank favors here 
on studen ts ' account 

The student checking plan. 
once offered by most major 
banks, seems destined to 
soon become a part of the 
PMt. Bank of America. the 
bank most convenient to 
campus residents. is one of 
the last area banks to cancel 
its student plan . 

Banks had student plans 
for pragmatic rather than 
selfless resaons. It was a 
cheap, attractive plan offered 
in hopes that , due to 
gratitude to the corporate 
body or just plain inertia, the 
student would continue to 
bank at that institution after 
he graduates and is earning 
big buck . 

Then, when a loan is 
needed for a house, car or 
yacht , the former student 

, . 

would naturally turn to the 
place where he has always 
done his banking. It seemed a 
good way for the banks to 
connect with the higher 
income earners before the 
competition had a chance. 

The plan. though, did not 
produce the intended result. 
Student checking plans were 
plagued with lost. stolen and 
forged checks, and the banks 
lost money hand over fist on 
the plans. 

Not only that . but the 
hoped·for corporate loyalty 
did not materialize. The 
primary criterion in bank 
selection turns out to be 
nothing more than simple 
convenience - the bank 
around the corner wins out 
every time.

Public transit offers escape 
This may be UC SanD., 

but in reaiit1, La Jolla is some 
dilt.nee from America's 
"Fineat City" - especially 
without a car: And that's 
when San Die&o Tl'IIlIit Co.

Five SDTC buaeI serve the 
UCSD CXIIIUIlunity and aU

trlftlferina bus. 

Route 21 originates at the 
North County Medical 
Center in Mira Mesa and 
travels west on Miramar 
Road. It stops at the Veterans 
Administration Hospital and 
enten the campus on its 
eouth side. The bus can be 
caUlht at the corner of Myers 
Drive and Gilman Drive on 

.. WII"I'eIl campus (in front of 
·the Bookatore). Transfers 
may be inade here to all other 
routealel'Vil'll UCSD. 

lavina UCSD, the 21 bus 
travels north throulh the 
Sorrento Valley Industrial 
Park, and then to Del Mar, 
where the route terminates 
on Del Mar Heights Road. 
Goina the other way, line 21 
travels past UTC by 
Miramar Naval Air Station 
and terminates at theK·Matt 
store in Mira Mesa. Service 
btgins around 6 am each day 
and ends around 9 pm. 

Route 41 is of particular 

use to studen ts because of the

serves the Mesa Apartments 
and the VA Hospital. 

Students can catch the bus 
on the comer of Myers and 
Gilman. where transfers may 
be made to routes 30, 24 and 
21. Route 41 is also equipped 

with new bikeracks. This 
handy equipment has been 
installed by San Diego 
Transit. Certain bus· stops 
along the route are 
designated as bike-loading 
zones. 

Going north, the. 41 
terminates at Scripps Clinic 
and Research Foundation. 
This is a .recent change, and 
those who previously took 
the 41 to Del Mar should use 
North County Transit line 
301. 

Route 30 . is the only 
express route serving UCSD. 
It begins in downtown San 
Diego. After coming north on 
1·5" it proceeds up Mission 
Boulevard through La Jolla, 
past Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography and to UCSO. 
The 30 bus stops at the 
comer of North Torrey Pines 
Drive and La Jolla Shores 
Drive and also on Warren 
campus. 

Route 50 is another 
express bus that takes 
passengers from the VA

Clairemont down 1--5 to 
downtown San Diego. The 
route has a limited schedule 
and runs only on weekdays. 
Service begins at 5:30 am and 
ends at 6:30 pm. 

• Going north to Del Mar and 
beyond on pti b1ic transit used 
to be quite a chore, but SOTC 
and the North County 
Transit District recently 
announced a plan that will 
greatly simplify transporta' 
tion in that area. 

NCTO line 301 previously 
terminated at 15th Street and 
CaminodelMar, where it met 
SDTC line 41. Now line 301 
extends all the way to the VA 
Hospi tal and line 41 
terminates at Scripps Clinic.

available from the Parking 
Services office, located 
behind the Central Cashier's 
office, Building 400 on 
Wanen campus. T~ permit 
allows free but transporta'

UCSD, includinc to Scripps 
.... titution of Oceenqp-aphy, 
Iftd to Univenity Towne 
Centre and La Jolla Villqe 

Amtrak: ticket to ride Many students coming from the Pacific and Mission Beach areas find the route 30 
bus to be most convenient. 
The bus runs from 5:30 am to 
11 pm Monday through 
Friday. 

The NCTO line stops in 
front of the Bookstore every 
half hour from 6:15 am to 
about 9:45 pm. There it 
connects with all other 
SOTC buses coming on 
campus. Both companies 
honor one another's transfer 
slips. Fare on line 301 is 50 
cents, and the line takes one 
hour and fifteen minutes to 
travel to Tremont and Third 
Streets in Oceanside. 

~ Die&o Tranait also has 
IIIODthiy full service passes, 
but they are ClOItly. The baic 
...... Saverpaa is $22.50 
and the basic Expreas 
SaVel.,.. is $30.

the DUlin routes wbich serve

Need an inexpensive ride 
up the coast? Amtrak is an 
easy and relatively inexpen· 
sive way of traveling to 
UCSD, Los Angeles and 
points beyond. The Del Mar

Street and Camino del Mar,

Beaches and finally to La 
Jolla and UCSO. The 34 bus 
runs through Warren 
campus and also serves the 
Mesa Apartments. The line

Local newspapers 
·link to 'real world' 

Bottled water cotnpanies 
turn students off of tap 

Every year it' the arne 
complaint: students ju t 
don't feel complete with a set 
of physics texts or mediaeval 
literature. What to do? 
Perhaps a subscription to a 
"real world" newspaper will 
perfect the balance. 

On the whole. area 
newspapers are as conserva-
tive as the local politicians 
they report , although more 
liberal, creative publications 
are also available. 

• For the serious news 
reader, the Los Angeles Times . 
offers the most responsible, 
thorough coverage . of 
national and international 
events. The paper recently 
opened a San Diego office, 
and is slowly expanding its 
limited reporting of this area. 

Student can subscribe to 
the Times on a mont hly basis, 
for $5.60 (Monday·Saturday 
issues). $3.60 (Sunday issue), 
or $7.60 (all issues). 

Home and dorm delivery 
are available. as well as 25· 
cent individual copies at 
newsstands on campus and 
throughout San Diego 
County. And with delivery 
between 4 and 6 am. the 
Times is the earliest major 
local daily to hit the streets. 

Subscribers are billed 
every eight weeks. To place a 
subscription, call 231·1433 . 

• The Copley Press strong· 
hold over San Diego is 
reflected in two rival though 
jointly·owned newspaper. 
The San Diego Union and the 
Eveni"g Tribune. 

The first paper, once rated 
amona the ten worst dailies 
nationally, has made a 
gradual comeback from 
slipshod journalism to 
adequate news coverage. 
News reporters at the 
morning Union are younger 
and freslle( than before, but 
the paper appeals best to a 
conservative readership. 

The Trihn, displays 
flashy headlines for a similar 
readership every evening 
except Sunday: Like its 
morning sibling, the paper's 
best quality is its large 
number of stories covering 
event. in San Diego County. 
Both the U"ion and Trib,l1Ie 
rely upon wire services for 
their bational and interna· 
tional news. 

Subscriptions to the Union 
are 16 per month for Sunday 
throueh Saturday issues. ' 
Billing is at the end of ~ch 
month. 

Trit""" subscriptions run 
IS per month for Monday 
through Saturday issues, or 
$6 per month with the 
Sunday U"io" edition . 
Billing can be made on a 
threet, six-, or 12·month 
basis. And both deliver to 
dorms and off-campus 
residences in San Diego 
County. 

The U"ion is on the streets 
by 6:30 am Monday through 
Saturday, and by 7:30 am on 
Sunday. The Trib,,", issues 
are in their stands by 5 pm 
Monday through Saturday. 
Call 299-·4141 for subscrip-
tions to either paper . 

• Undoubtedly die fastest · 
p:owing weekly paper in ~n 
Dieao is the RaIder, which 
offers each Thurseh. an 

assortment of well ·written 
feature s ranging from 
seriou accounts on San 
Diego politics to empathic 

. stories on mellowness and 
beachdom. 

Some of San Diego's most 
impres ively inane Questions 
and letters get prominence in 
the Reader. as does a wide 
collection of arts features . 
And the publication's 
classified section is one of the 
most widely read and most 
extensive in the county. 

Best yet: the Readerdoesn't 
cost a cent. It's distributed 
t hroughou t the coun ty, 
including at UCSD. Check 
with EDNA or one of the 
libraries for a copy. Get them 
early, though : they go fast. 

• 
For students whose 

budgets or lack of interest 
discourage a subscription to 
one of San Diego's newspa-
pers, EDNA and the libraries 
on campus have copies of the 
pulications to browse 
through. Just don't take them 
home. 

It was again t univer-
sity policy, but no one paid 
much attention to the on· 
campus soliciting among 
bottled water companies 
through the years. After 
all, students needed to 
know the options to San 
Diego's undisputedly 
unpalatable water. 

The three major area 
bottled water companies 
had worked under a 
"gentlemen's agreement." 
with each company 
promoting at a different 
dorm or campus apart-
ment. 

But last year. their 
agreement dissolved 
under increasiOJly li'en:e 
campus compedtiQn, atId 
they "had a smaD w.r." 
according to Ritk Bayer, 
Housing and Food Ser-
vices officer. 

That won't happen 
again, Bayer says. Instead, 
Arrowhead Drinking 
Water will have exclusive 
rights to solicit campus 
residents, under a cootract 

agreement with the 
university. 

While students can stiU 
patronize Arrowhead's 
two competitors. Silver 
Springs and Sparkletts, 
only Arrowhead will be 
able to set up displays on 
campus. ' 

All the intensive 
nl'gOtiations that resulted 
in Arrowhead's winning 
bid, of course. are to 
students' benefit. T

What an Amazing Man! 
Versatility a Plus and Minus for Christmas 

BY REBECCA LOWEN 
9tIIII Writer 

"U I've got one real value, 
it's my versatility. I have a 
big, biI ranae," confided an 
unabashed Eric Christmas. 

This versatility has 
brought him involvement in 
everything from teaching 
introductory drama at UCSD 
to acting in the recent film, 
M iddk-Age Crazy, as well as 

Profe8llOr Eric Christmas, Old Globe and movie star, 
in a photo taken when he 8till had a beard 

San Diego's annual Shakes· 
peare Festival. He will also 
direct UCSD's fall produc-
tion of Tobacco RomJ and has 
written a pantomime which 
he hopes to begin producing 
soon. 

Needless to say, Christmas 
is a very busy man. After 
eight days of trying to contact 
him, The Daily Guardill1l 
finally caught up with him in 
his dressing room at the Old 
Globe. one hour before he was 
to go on the stage as Friar 
Lawrence in Romeo and 
Juliet. The diminutive 
British actor was disarming. 
Iy frank about his abilities 
and his career as both an 
actor and teacher. 

"Versatili ty can work 
against you," he explained, 
keeping an ear atuned to the 
PA system so as not to miss 
his cue. "The public doesn 't 
identify you , you know. If I 
say to you, 'Lou Grant, ' you 
know exactly what I'm ' 
talking about. That's a label 
that's instantly identifiable 
by the public." 

Perhaps another reason he 
does not receive such instant 
recognition is that he's never 
played lead romantic roles 
("I'm very short. "). 

Few' people may realize 
that Christmas, who plays 
Bruce Dern's father in 
Middle-Age Crazy, is the 
same man who played the 

• priest in Harold and Maude. 
He was also the apartment 
manager on the Sandy 
Duncan Show and 4id bit

Nobody's Fool 
UCSD Prof Will Direct New Beckett 

BY JEFF 
BERESFORD. HOWE 

An.1IIIt.-
Alan Schneider is nobody's 

fool. 
He knows that the quickest 

way to any journalist's heart 
is an exclusive. So he had one 
when , went to interview him 
last week. . 

"What am I going to be 
doing this year? Well, I really 
shouldn't let this out, but I'm 
going to direct the world 
premiere of a new Samuel 
Beckett play in April, 
Rocltabye. with Irene Worth. 

""m not sure where it's 

Rocltaby. will be part of a 
nationat celebration of 
Bec"~t'.s 75th birthday this 
spring. Beckett is certain to 
win almost universal 
acclaim, but it wasn't always 
so, even when Beckett's best 
known play, Godot, made its 
American debut in Miami, 
Florida. 

Miami? 
"Bert Lahr said it was like 

taking Giselle to Roseland. I 
begged the producers not to 
do it. But Miami was the only 
place they could get a 
guarantee, so that's where 
we opened. Ninety percent of 

'Bert Lahr said it was like 
taking Giselle to Roseland. I 
begged them not to do it ... ' 

Before Beckett beckons, 
the Tony Award·winning 
Schneider will direct a 
"Wilder Evening" at UCSD, 
three one-acts by Thornton 
Wilder. 

"Wilder is one ofthe two or 
three best American 
playwrights," Schneider 
says. (His other favorites are 
O'Neill, Williams, Albee and 
Arthur Miller.) 

"He's just being recognized 
again because he's not 
writing plays about stuff you 
find on page four of the 
newspaper. He's not limited 
by topicality. He presents 
certain truths, and his plays 
are in a sense myths of the 
Americao past and inno-
cence.

Jesus. Thornton Wilder and 
Our Town again.' Well, OIIr 
Town is a major work of art. I . 

going to play; probably the people walked out on the did it in the USSR with the 

parts in the Colombo series. 
But if Christmas has not 

exactly made it "big" in 
Hollywood, he hardly suffers 
from lack of recognition 
locally. He has long been a 
San Diego favorite in the 
annual Shakespeare Festi· 
val, and he offered only the 
mildest protest at the 
suggestion that all his 
performances are greeted 
with glowing reviews. 

He recently performed a 
one· man show at the Globe in 
which he gave the well· 
disposed audience a look at 
past characters he's played. 

While Christmas prides 
himself on his ability to do 
character roles in a variety of 
mediums, he also admits to 

makes him a misfit in the 
UCSD drama department, 
which he readily acknow· 
ledges as being "experiment· 
I .. a . 
"I think my value on 

campus comes from my 
background. There's nothing 
more valuable than being 
able to get on top of classical 
texts. I have respect for the 
challenge that classics brings 
- if you can play Juliet, you 
can play in Charlie's Angels." 

But Christmas is stepping 
outside the classics this fall , 
in what may be yet another 
demonstration of his 
versatility. He will direct

Mother Goose in a show he 
wrote and will direct. 
being "quite a good teacher." 
One reason may be that he 
believes acting and teaching 
require much the same skills. 

"To bore an audience is 
inexcusable; if you bore 
students, it's the same thing. 
I have asenseofaudienceand 
a sense of presentation and I 
apply all those things (in 
teaching). " 

In his classes, Christmas, 
who trained at the Royal 
Academy of Dramatic Art, 
concentrates on the classic. 
But he doesn't think this 

Georgia sharecropper and 
his family. 

"I chose a play that speaks 
for this country - and I 
equate it with Mice and Men. 
It belongs to a period in the 
country's recent history that 
we should be reminded of. We 
talk about how bad things are 
now, but how bad things 
were then is something that 
should be recalled, I think." 

Christmas also hopes to be 
able to direct, as well as 
produce, his own show, a

Real World Theater 
SD Isn't As Bad As You Thought 

BY JILL WUlSE BAZELEY 
special 10 The Dally Guardillll 

Here you are in San Diego ... at loose ends for 
something to do ... going to the movies at 
University Towne Center doesn't have 
enough 'cache: and someone you sharea su ite 
with has already ventured forth a world· 
weary comment that San Diego is the city of 
cultural deprivation .... So you might as well 
forget about any "high class" entertainment 
- it' the UTC 6 and Caddyshack or nothing. 
Got that? Now what do you do? 

Well , you listen to me. While [ was 
compiling t he stacks of notes that went into 
researching thi , my annual ditty . I found 
there are no les than 37 theatre groups in an 
Diego .. . and probably more if you count the 
ones I forgot. That leaves you wi th a few 
alternatives ... and The Daily Guardiml, in it 
infinite sagacity, has entrusted me to tell you 
which alternatives I think are best. 

Now. the very best theatre value in town i 
right here on campus at the UCSD Theatre. 
And in spite of the fact that it 's a lways been a 
forum for testing out the ideas of dramatic 

theorists who've long been in their graves, it 
has its many moments. 

You ' ll see productions at the UCSD Theatre 
that you may never see anywhere again. 
That's because money is no object (thank you, 
taxpayers) and the UCSD people are free to go 
about the bu iness of making art, not bucks. 

Next on my list of best bets is The Old Globe 
Theatre/Carter Center Stage. Here again a 
tudent can make out pretty inexpensively if 

he buys a sea on subscription and goe on 
Sunday afternoon , but single tickets aren't 
prohibitively expensive either. They often 
don ' t cn-;t any more than it costs to go see 
Caddyshack . The price schedules are 
complicated . so call the box offi ce at 239-2255. 

This season The Old Globe Theatre (at the 
Spreckles Theatre downtown) is offeri ng two 
comedies, a drama and a thriller. The first 
comedy, A PemlY for a S01lg, promises you 
"chuckles, guffaw, giggles, chortles and 
howls of laughter." (Someone has a

TIIC "c1l1 ~, S Cpll' IIlIJCI' I (i. I HHO 

BY WILLIAM HAMILTON 
Staff Writer 

Within the last two years 
in the San Diego area, rock 
and roll has been making a 
comeback. Whereas the disco 
craze of the mid and late 
seventies virtually eradi. 
cated all but a handful of 
establishment s which 
catered exclusively to rock 
and roll clien te le, the 
popularity of New Wave in 
loc al nigh ts po ts ha s 
revitalized th e lo ca l 
entertainment industry and 
has made live rock music 
fashionable and lucrative. 

Not all nightspots are alike, 
however, and those within 
the proximity of UCSD cater 
to distinct categories of 
clientele. Your educational 
experience at UCSD must not 
be restricted to academia, as 
this is but one perspective of 
college life. Therefore, you 
are obligated to sample some 
of the variegated perversions 
and delights. 

Armed wi th a modest 
budget to cover drinks and 
admission charges, and a 
large-caliber handgun for 
protection at some of the 
seedier establi shments, I 
embarked on a quest t hrough 
the more popu lar of these 

nightclubs to bring you this 
first-hand report. 
North County 

Dick's at the Beach is an 
established over-21 night 
club which features live rock 
entertainment seven nights a 
week. One of the few bastions 
of rock and roll to hold-out 
against the disco craze and 
survive financially, Dick's 
was the birthplace of the 
popular San Diego group, 
Bratz, which still plays t here 
frequently. 

Dick himself is one of the 

more popular nightclub 
operators in the area . One 
woman I conversed with in 
the establishment who was a 
regular weekend patron told 
me, "r just love Dick"; so you 
can see how his hospitality 
has left an impression upon 
his customers. The drinks 
are moderately priced and the 
$1 cover charge is competi-
tive. Although the facilities 
are somewhat cramped and 
the sound usually garbled 
and intense, this is a regular 
stop for San Diego's bes t rock 
bands, including Bratz, the 
Blitz Brothers, and Fluke_ 

Down the highway from 
Dick's is the Old No. 7 
Dist ille ry, which is a recent

And Roll, But ... 

entrant in to the rock scene by 
San Diego standards. A very 
nice place to take your ' 
g irlfriend or boyfr iend , 
dependi ng on who's after 
Whom, and a low-pres ure 
pick-up spot for singles. The 
stage and dance area are 
intelligently-juxtaposed, the 
volume levels are comfor-
tably-set , inducing conversa-
tion and entertainment 
simultaneously. 

The cover charge is about 
average at $2, but is well 
worth it, considering the 
decor and friend ly people who 
patronize it (predominantly 
23-30 age range). Live music 
is featured Thursday 
through Sunday , with 
recorded music offered 
Monday through Thursday 
for you serious dancers . Wear 
nice clothing or you will bean 
object of derision . 

Also in Solana Beach is the 
Bell y-Up T a vern , which 
caters to a lower-income 
crowd. They sell only beer 

and wine, but it is quite 
possible to do some serious 
drinking at their exceptional-
ly- affordable prices. The 
Belly-Up was one of the first 
local clubs to bring in big. 
name entertainment, and 
routinely showcases some of 
the finest blues artists in the 
business for a reasonable 
cover charge_ Seating is 
usually scarce when the big-
name acts appear, so be sure 
to get there early (unless you 
enjoy sitting on your own 
lap). A minimal amount of 
throwing-up is done around 
the perimeter of the 
premises, which indicates 
that this is a good clientele. 
South of Campus

members of the band were 
turned away because they 
didn't conform to the 
riaorously-enforced dress 
code. 

Mom's is an exception in 
this business, in that it 
brinp down Loa Angeles 
touriq acts and books them 
for a one-week stint. A 
sl.-.tly higher caliber of 
musicianship is ~pP8J'ent, 
and the acts are tilht and 
polished. Like many 
establishments, Mom's 
offers special prices on 
certain drinks on otherwise-
off niPts to _ people in 
there. and seating is 
inevitably a problem on such 

nights. The clu b strikes you 
as a place where men go to 
look at women and visa 
versa. but neither gender 
seems to get together. 

Jerry Herrerra's Spirit, 
located in the Morena district 
of San Dieao. is a showcase 
spot for local bands 
promoting themselves and 
being promoted. Herrerra, a 
former heavy on the local 
promotion scene when he 
owned the popular JJ.'s 
downtown, recently changed 
his format of cover-material 
bands in favor of presenting 
original talent. This is 
perhaps the best spot in town 
to go for live music in San 
Diego, althoueh the arts and 

crowd response are at times 
unpredictable. Audition 
nights are best avoided. 

New Wave enthusiasts will 
find Spirit a veritable 
cornucopia of this type of 
music. However, the 
appearance of the establish-
ment (it looks like and 
probably was an industrial 
operation at one time) leaves 
much to be desired, as do the 
prices of the consistently 
weak drinks. The Rick Elias 
Band, DFX 2, Jerry Rainey 
and the Shames, and the 
Strangers are frequent 
performers there. 

The Bacchanal in Claire-
mont has experimented with 
rock, disco, name acts, and 
has finally returned to rock 
and roll, with some regional 
entertainment being brought 
in by local performers. Rock 

revitalized the place when 
Bratz performed there for an 
unprecented stint. A 
working·class crowd fre-
quents this club. and 
conversation is lively and 
animated between sets. The 
spacious facilities ensure 
seating, and the decorum of 
the crowd is· a pleasant 180 
percent from the Sports 
Arena scum. Mdderately 
expensive, but pleasant 
surroundings. flan to park 
more than your car if you are 
so inclined. 
UCSD

in the way of rock and roll 
than most resident deans 
would care to admit. UEO

thesaurus) It opens Nov. 4. The other comedy is Relalively 
SfJMking, by Alan Ayckbourn - a master of English bedroom 
comedy and always good for a laugh. 

The Carter Center Stage has lined up three dramas and a 
oomedy beginning on Nov. 18 with Sea Marks, a San Diego 
premiere about an Irish fi herman who falls in love with a 
woman by correspondence. Of course that 's no big deal , but it 
turns into a "romantic encounter and a tender, bittersweet 
drama." That changes things, doesn 't it? 

The San DitgO Repertory Theatre is quartered in an old 
mortuary chapel on Sixth Avenue downtown, and although 
its productions are enjoyable and play selection is the best in 
the city, the wood pews that pass for seats are awful. If you 
wem\'t reared religiously and aren't used to this sort of thing, 
tring along a cushion for your back. 

The Rep hal a ... pecial dispensation for student tickets, and 
is hiIh up on my list of theatre values. 

The Marquis Public Theatre on India Street is a source of 
confup. That's because it handles a lot of short· term 
~ions and is actually four theatres in one - The 

--- Marquis Public Theatre, The Marquis Gallery Theatre, The 
Marquis West Broadway Theatre and the After Theatre 
Theatre. Of course, the Marquis West Broadway Theatre 
isn't on India Street at all, it's on West Broadway .. .ln any case 
this IfOUP of four theatres is where you'll find the off· beat 
kinds of aoing-oll6, like Women's Theatre, Insomniacs 
Theatre and Chicano Theatre, as well as new and Innovative 
playa. 

The San Diego Playgoers Series, at the Fox Theatre 
downtown, takes us into the realm of high ticket prices, 
aometimes for low quality shows. These are road shows I'm 
talking about, where the cast has been fattening up for six 
months on a diet of Denny's and McDonald's. A,,,.ie is there 
now, but it's hard to predict what the Playgoers will come up 
with next - it oould be awful. 

If your pocketbook can stand it, the San Diego Opera is 
worth a try. It charltS exorbitant ticket prices and receives a 
ooloual amount of funding, so it caWnport guest stars like 
Beverly Stills, who is ending her career here this fall. 

I've never been to the Fiesta Dinner Theatre, but that ought 
to be aaood place toao, too. And don't forget the Comedy Store 
or The Theatre of the Deaf.

For you under·21ers and 

non·drinkers, Journey is the 
place to venture. Because 
most nightclulE make money 
off of alcohol and can 
therefore demand a modest 
cover charge, expect to pay 
more to get in the door at 
Journey. Here, most of the 
New Wavers congregate to 
listen to their favorite bands, 
including the T·Birds, Snails, 
and hard·core rockers I ike the 
Salty Dogs anc1Air«aft: The 
club cannot be faulted for its 
appearance and administra· 
tion, nor its booking, but the 
clientele should be mention· 
ed. Many of the patrons will 
have difficulty understand· 
ing you if you use multi· 
syllabic words and a general 
high·school mentality 
pervades, despite the fact 
that the ~ range is 17·25. 

Everywhere Else 
Finally, there are many 

ooncert series and theatres 
which offer a potpourri of 
local and national rock 
bands, although these are 
rather sporadically promot· 
ed. The Roxy Theatre in 

Pacific Beach alternately 
shows films and features live 
bands, so check with them 
periodica lly t o ascertain 
which. The Catamaran and, 
more recently , the Bahia 
Hotel , br ing in national acts 
such a B.B. King, but once 
again , there is li tt le 
continuity. 

San Diego State typically 
hosts multiple concert series 
at its Back Door and Open· 
Air Amphitheater, including 
Zappa, Heart, the Kinks, the 
Allman Brothers, and Jeff 
Beck to mention a recent few. 
The heavies (the Rolling 
Stones, Zepplin -T-ul1;-etc.) 
invariably opt for the only 
facility which can accomo-
date throngs of human 

debris, the Sports Arena, 
which is the finest echo 
chamber in town andis oneof 
the ugliest facilities of its 
kind in the non·Stalinist 
worlrl 

When t he oppor t un it y 
presents itself, opt for Golden 
Hall or the Civic Theat er 
downtown, as t he acoustics 
are far superior and the 
seating is restricted and 
limited to a comfortable 
capacity. Plus, hot· selling 
new acts are usually booked 
into these facilities to test· 
market their potential 
concert draw (recall that the 
Beatles, Boston, Tull, 
Trower, the Dead and 
virtually anyone who could 
fill the Sports Arena has 
passed through the Civic at 
least once). 

UEO Plans 
continued from pale 33

In addition, the organiza·

been confirmed at this time.

Alan Schneider 
continued from pale 26 

Schneider chose UCSD for 
the same reason most people 
do - the weather. He likes to 
swim, and he likes the sun. 

But the opportunities in 
the theater were important, 
too. 

"You see that hole in the 
ground, II he said, pointing at 
the' site of the theater under 
construction behind the 
Humanities Library. "That's 
one of the reasons [ came 
here. There ought to be a 
company in repertory there, 
and I think there can be, in 
three to five years. 

"It's like a doctor. They go 
to a university and get their 
degree, and then do their 
internship for two or three 
years. That's what should 

happen here. People s hould 
go to school , then work in 
that theater for awhile as 
playwrights, directors and 
actors . Every university 
should have a theater like 
that," Schneider says. 

Schneider works with six 
graduate student directors -
two are admitted to the three· 
year program every year -
and comes in contact with 
undergraduates only when 
they are in a play he directs. 

While a majority of the 
actors were undergrads in his 
one show last year, Tin Great 
American Quiz Show 
Scandtzl, Schneider acknow· 
ledges that UCSD is not the 
best place for undergraduate 
actors. 

"We're good if you want to 

g(J into technical theater. 
We 're desperately looking for 
people working backstage, 
and I think any actor should 
learn how to do that , but our 
graduate program is 
professionally oriented and 
our undergraduate program 
is academically oriented. 

"If students want to spend 
all of their time acting, I 
think they have some 
legitimate grievances. I guess 
places like Yale and Berkeley 
are better for them ," 
Schneider says. 

Another problem for actors 
here, he says, is a lack of 
actors to watch and study on 
stage. 

"Everyone used to tour

More than one thou and swimmer of all 

ages took part in the 50th Annual La Jolla 
Rough Water Swim two weekends ago at La 
Jolla Cove. As many as 10,000 spectators 
jammed surrounding cliffs, jetties and 
apartment balconies and roofs watching 
the competitors make their way around 
strategically placed buoys in the ocean. 

Junior swimmers went first, kicking off 
the Swim on an overcast Sunday morning. 
All contestants under 12 years of age were 
required only to swim a 150'yard course. 
Most skimmed in under three minutes due 
to the calm surf and relatively warm water 
- a refreshing 68 degrees. 

Entrants in the larger division of the 
compet ition followed a one-mile'route out to 
La olla Shores and back. Included in the

Senior swim were the Ma ter's categories 
for athletes over 25 years old. The men's 
division simultaneously launched 350 
participants, undou btedly oneof the largest 
number ever to hit the Pacific at one time. 

The swim, which began as an annual 
event but which locals now regard as an 
institution. is the largest of its kind in the 
world. The first race took place in 1916 but 
did not resume again until 1923 due to 
World War l. Since 1931 the event has 
become a yearly tradition although the 
annual progression has been interrupted 
three times because of lack of a sponsor, 
polio epidemics and s hark sightings. Every 
contestant who finishes the race receives a 
survivor's ribbon, with the top three 
finalists receivin tro hies.

Spikers start 
optimistic season 

BY SCOTT ALLISON 
Senior Staff Writer 

Potent4al is an overused 
word in sports, as is depth. 
Yet both words are 
appropriatf' in a preview of 
the 1980 UCSD women's 
volleyball team. . 

Strengthened by the 
addition of six freshmen , 
three of whom are possible 
starters, the spikers are now 
deep in every position. Their 
versatility adds depth. 

"Right now it's just a 
matter of who plays well with 
whom and finding the right 
combinations," says outside 
hitter Cheryl Wright. "This 
early in the year we're just 
learning to play together." 

Last year UCSD's Athlete 
of t~e Year, Elaine Bergman, 
domtnated the Triton attack. 
This year the load will not 

fall solely on her shoulders. 
as newcomers Michele 
Whitmore and Liz Burrill 
team with Bergman and 
veteran Sherre Lilley to form 
a hard-hitting offense that 
rivals the men's team in 
talent. 

Freshman Louise (Lulu) 
Schwartz, from Pacific 
Palisades High, is UCSD's 
flashy new setter. An 
effective Schwartz-Bergman 
combination could be the 
club's most devastating 
weapon. 

The squad's only missing 
ingredient is cohesion, which 
will come with time. Their 
first chance to work together 
in the season will occur this 
Thursday, when they face 
New Mexico State .

Serious cases requiring 
hospitalization are referred 
to Scripps Memorial Hospital 
in La 101la. 

The Student Health Center 
gives limited coverage to 
students for such services as 
am bulance, medical and 
surgical, dental injury, 
pregnancy and maternity, 
mental illness, and nervous 
disorder care. The only 
hospital care included in the 
plan is emergency care, and 
first must be referred by the 
Health Center. 

Because the Center does 
not cover non·emergency 
hospital expenses, students 
should be included on a 
separate, more complete 
insurance policy. 

For students not covered 
on another policy, the 
university offers an optional 
insurance plan. At a cost of 
$34.25 per quarter, students 
receive coverage for a variety 
of major medical expenses. 

Anyone interested in using 
the optional plan for all 
quarter must sign up at the 
Health Center during limited 
hours by Nov. 1. For more 
information, contact -La 
Rayne Penny at extension 
3300. 

The Health Center is open 
from 8 am to 11:30 am and 
from 1 pm to 4:30pm Monday 
through Friday. A registered 
nurse is on duty at all other 
times.

Although Bekken and 
SDSP advocate an active, 
visi ble st ance aga i nst 
registration, the university's 
registration counselor favors 
a middle-of·the·road position. 

Even though SDSP 
believes that the Justice 
Department will not 
prosecute unregistered 
eligible men, Mary Virga, 
UCSD's draft registration 
coordinator, reminds 
students that the penalty for 
not registering "is still a 
maximum five-year prison 
term and a $10,000 fine." 

The 93 percent figure "was 
probably high," she says. 
"Nob.ody has definite 
accurate figures, but the anti-
draft organizations figure of 
30 percent appears more 
accurate," Virga says. 

"If the figure is closer to 30 
percent, then it would appear 
that they (the Justice 
Department) probably won't 
do anything," she says. "The 
less percent (of non -
compliance), the more they're 
going to do something." 

Virga notes that students 
can still register, "though 
they may face consequences 
for registering late. ... They 
might end up with some-
thing" such as prosecution. 

"Thegovemment can goat 
any time to the DMV 
(Department of Motor 
Vehicles) or school records to 
get information for prosecu-
tion, Virga says. She notes, 
however, that Social Security 
numbers cannot be u!'\~ . ~

Act of 1974.

do it alone). While the need 
for student participation is 
great, students will not be 
dragged screaming and 
kicking into the Student 
Center. However, we do 
reserve the option of using 
drugged dart guns with 
throw nets and other creative 
methods of gaining AS 
lackeys. 

Each quarter, every 
undergraduate enrolled at 
UC San Diego is obliged to 
pay $247. Four fees make up 
this $247: the education fee of 
$100, the registration fee of 
$131, a Student Center fee of 
$10 and an activity fee of $6. 
The ed fee is used to 
su pplemen t academ ic 
services. 

The Reg Fee Committee 
allocates the ' reg fee to 
student services like the 
Health Center and OASIS. 
The Student Center fee goes 
to the Srudent Center Board 
for, as you might guess, 
maintaining the Student 
Center. The Associated 
Students allocate the six 
dollar Activity Fee. 

The Associated Student 
government is the campus· 
wide student government of 
which every undergraduate 
is a member. The AS has a 
representative style of 
government consisting of a 
president, vice president, and 
the AS. Council. Nine 

commissioners and ~welve 
college representatives sit on 
the council which is chaired 
by the vice president. Each 
commissioner has a title and 
heads a commission with 
specific responsibilities (see 
list of commissioners). All 
twenty·three of the above 
positions are contested in the 
AS elections conducted 

Student organiUltions range 
from cultural, educational, 
social and professional and 
are responsible for a fair, 
percentage of campus 
programming. UCSD has an 
abundance of media group 
providing students with 

'diverse opportunities in 
journalism and giving 
students various forum s to

Associated Students Council as a means of keeping

Council and does not represent ' the opinions of the

each year. 

One of the primary 
responsibilities of the 
Associated Students is the 
judicious allocation of the

good portion of the AS budget 
goes to student organizations 
and to campus media .

in the Student Center 
(inexpensive records). Some 
S)f the student run, on-

its ProgrammiRg Board 
headed by the Commissioner 
of Programming. This board 
puts on TGIF's, dances.

The University recognizes 

that self-perning student 
organizations can and do 
contribute to the educational, 
locial. recreational and 
personal developmen t of 
students_ In many ways, a 
student orpnizati(Jl can do 
it better than a single 
student. Since the university 
does not s~sor or accept 
responsibihty for student 
organizations, you are on 
your own_If you want to form 
an orpnizat,ion, or join an 
existing one, the best place to 
start is with the Student 
Orpnizations' office in the 
Student Center. The 
administrative assistant, 
M.rietta Williams, has a 
complete listing of all 

~«ed orpnizations. If

which you need. 

To become Ul orpDization 
you need a minimum 01 four 
current1y enroUed students. 
The four people listed on the 
ieciettation form will be 
~ible for the operatioo 
01 the orpnizatioo and serve 
as cont-=ts for other students 
interested in the organiza- ' 
tion. 

A11O, you have to complete 
a non-discrimination form 

and a constitution for your 
organization. (The form and 
a sample constitution are 
included in the registration 
packet.) After the paperwork 
is done, the Organizations' 
Advisor must approve it, and 
then the organization 
becomes officiaJly recogni· 
zed. 

As a registered organiza· 
tion, you are eligible for: 
1. Programming and opera-
ting funds from the AS. If you 
need support, talk to your 
college representative. 
2. Use of facilities: con-
ference rooms, auditoriums 
and lecture halls are 
available to organizations at 
no or nominal charge. 
3. Bookkee.ping services 
provided by Josie Hollinger 
and Nora Aust. Get to know 
them, they will prove to be 
invaluable. 
4. Help on special projects: 
The AS and/or the university

ways than just providing

quarter, I appointed over 200 
students to positions of their 
own choosing: Ambassador-
ships and titles of nobility 
were the most popular. 
Bribes ranged from 20 cents 
to a dollar, depending on the 
position requested. I will be 
continuing this practice - I 
need the money. Come by the 
Student Center to receive 
your appointment certificate. 

Recently, I formed the 
Presidential Task Force on 
Increasing Retention and

The entire undergraduate 
student body have been 
appointed to this task force 
and you may all record this 
on your resumes. Duties 
include having a good time 
and , not transfering to 
another schooL (Another ' 
campaign promise out of the 
way.) 

During the coming year, 
the AS will need anum ber of 
AS lackeys. If I'm gOing to get 
into a graduate school, I will 
need ~ recommendations 

stating what an outstanding 
student leader I am. This 
means the AS will have to 
actually do something this 
year. This is where you come 
in. During the next few 
weeks we will appoint over 
one hundred people to 
campuswide committees (see 
committees -section of 
Bulletin). We also need a 
larger number of people to 
serve on AS commissions 
(headed by AS commis-
sioners such as External

researching and acting upon 
a certain issue. 

You can get student 
organizations to love me by 
joining them in vast num bers 
and participating in their 
many fine activities. There 
are over 100 registered 
student organizations 
clamoring for more members

you can start your own. 

There are many other

The Women's Center, located 011 the 

ground Door of the Student Center, is the 
campus headquarters for the feminist 
movement. 

Women's Center 
Group deals with social change 

We are in the middle of a 
period of social change in 
which the concept of the 
female role is changing 
radically. The increase in 
new alternatives also brings 
along with it much confusion 
for women students who 
have traditionally been 
socialized to consider 
marriage and family roles as 
being of primary importance. 
As a result, Women's Centers 
have been created on 
campuses across the country 
in an effort to deal with the 
special needs brought up by 
these changes. We of the 
Women's Center Collective 
are firmly convinced that 
UCSD needs our Women's 

need members, the AS needs 
people to run AS programs 
like SCURI (undergraduate 
research grants) and the AS 
Internship Office, and on and 
on. The more people involved, 
happy and contented, the 
better I look. Please talk to me 
on how you, too, can gain 
experience, friends and 
become a dynamic individual 
like me.

committed to changing the 
present conditions that are 
oppressive to women, and 
want to help women develop 
themselves in ways that 
women are not helped by the 
society to develop. 

We are planning many 
activities and programs this 
year that you can get 
involved in. We will be 
having a Women's Film 
Series, a series of conferences 
and seminars dealing with 
issues facing women in this 
society, brown bag lunches 
with women faculty, an ERA

Women's Video group, as 
well as two concerts by

also open to your ideas for 
new programs and activities.

Coops deal in food, records, books 
The birth of the Recycling 

C(H)J) was the ambitious 
endeavor of several Food Co-
op members who realized the 
vast problems of waste on 
campus. Massive numbers of 
trees are saaificed tach year 
to the computers, class-
rooms, laboratories and the 
administration of the 
University. The Recycling 
Co-op has made a substantial 
dent in the forest of dead 
trees by hard work and 
dedication. Their efforts will 
continue to payoff with the 
openina of the Ecology 
Center this fall located in the 
Student Center. TheEcoiogy 
Center will be the horne of the 
Recyclina Co-op, the At.lone 
Alliance and the Appropriate 
Tec:hnoIoIY Club, as well as a 
library ariCI resource material 
on environmental issues. 

Assorted Vinyl opened 
during the spring of last year 
with the aoal of providing 
recorda and tapes at a <XI8t far 
below that of retail record 
stores in the area. This 
enterpOle was the brainchild 
of last year's AS Council and 
thus the first attempt to build 
a co-op from the clouds down 
rather than the ground up. As 
any "collectively aware" 
person knows, a co-op spring 
from the need of a group, not 
the mandated or an "official 
order." Well. now a lot of 
other people are being 
enliahtened to that fact ... but 
there's still hope! Join 
Assorted Vinyl and keep it 
cmperative, no <»OPted! 

Looking for a break from 
those hectic, bum-out classes 
of yours? Seeking to remove 
the negative influence of the 
institutions that surround 
you? A simple way to do both 
of these is to plant a patch of 

v~ at the UCSD Organic 
Garden site on the north part 
of campus. By growing foods 
organically, one achieves 
independence from the oil 
companie who waste 
precious national gas in the 
making chemical fertilizer.

students 

The Student Center for 
Undergraduate Research and 
Innovation (SCURI) is a

Olga finds joy in cooperation 
Once upon a time, a girl 

named Olga came to UCSD. 
She was fresh from a middle 
class. su burban high school. 
eager and readytotakeon the 
world. One day she was 
walking through the Student 
Center when she aw the 
Food Co-op. A guy named 
Steve was sitting in front, 
and Olga asked him, "What' 
a co-op?" "Well." said Steve. 
"A co-op is a bu iness owned 
and controlled by its 
membership, which enables 
the members to received 
goods and services at prices 
below that which they pay at 
the usual retail stores." 
"That sound great," said 
Olga, stunned at something 
so terrific, "But how does it 
work?" "By working 2-4 
hours a week in the co-op you 
can receive goods or services 
at a great discount. But ro-
op are also meeting places. 
Major decision are decided 
by the membership - the 

workers. Several people are 
usually hired as coordinators 
- elected by the member-
ship. Participation in co-ops 
provides members and others 
with training in bu iness 
principles and community 
issues. The co-op member-
hip develop a great sense of 

community and pride; a real 
familyatmo phere is formed. 
Co-op membership increases 
the dignity of individuals by_ 
giving them a sense of 
owner hip and participation 
in the business that serves." 
"But how do I get involved?" 
asked Olga. "That's easy," 
said Steve, "Just tell someone 
working at the co-op. sign-up 
on the work schedule and 
come to a meeting." "[s there 
only a food co-op?" 
"Goodness, no," exclaimed 
Steve. "At UCSD we have 
many co-ops. Besides the food 
co-op. we have a general 
store. a record co-op. a 
recycling co-op. a Ground-

works Collect ive Bookstore, a 
collective restaurant and 
we're working on a 
coopertive housing project." 
Olga quickly got involved. 
She unloaded boxes at the 
food co-op, learned to do the 
books at the general store, 
ordered record and met 
band at the record store, and 
made omlettes at the Coffee 
Hut Collective. 

This fall when she 
returned to UCSD she felt a 
great deal of belonging. She 
was very happy to see the 
close friends she had made in 
the co-ops. She learned that 
the co-ops had formed a 
network which included the 
new indicator collective 
newspaper, in which workers 
fo the co-op received benefits 
in other co-ops. So Olga spent 
two hours a week working at 
the Coffee Hut and had time 
to take some cia ·ses. She fell 
in love with Steve, and lived 
happily ever after. 

Day care benefit set next month 
Over one and a half years 

ago the ~tudent!; at UC D 
VOICed their approval (in a 
referendum) of partial reg fee 
support of our UC D Day 
Care Center. Since that time. 
our center continues to 
thrive_ 

To help continuing effort 
to support and expand the 
current facili ties, many 
people from many different 
departments and the 
community are coming 
together to produce the first 
annual Day Care Benefit 
Concert on October 26 at 

Mandeville . Wat ' h for 
further notices of their 
e ci t i ng even 109 of entertain-
ment. 

A major concern of the 
growing population of 
st udent parents is the 

~carcity of quality child care. 
This ' ummer ihe state 
legislat ure passed the Seroity 
Bill allocating funds for 
expansion of child care 
facilIties. UC D's Day Care 
Center is applying for money 
for a new infant care center. 
Chancellor Atkinson has 

supported thl~ move by 
granting c pace and encourag-
ing expansion to ~ecure more 
students with quality child 
care. 

Also this year . the parents 
at the Day Care Center 
formed the Association of 
Student Parents. ASP holds 
meetings each month to 
address concerns of parents 
at the Day Care Center and 
lICSD. Everyone is welcome.

Watch for the grand 
opening of the General Store 
this Fall! Here's your chance 
to get in on the grou nd floor of 
the newest in the family of 
coop on campus. 

The Coffee Hut was part of 
the University Food and 
Housing ser ices until it was 
closed in 1979 due to 
inefficiency. Controversey 
s urrounded plans for 
conversion to a faculty club. 
After a long fight a group of 
students that met through 
the Food Coop gained control 
of- the facility to establish a 
collective restaurant there. 
Volunteer hours renovated 
the building at a fraction of 
the original University 
estimate. The Coffee Hut 
Collective , (affectionately 
called "Che Cafe"), opened 
in the spring of 1980 offering • 
organic vegetarian meals at a 
reduced cost. The Coffee Hut 
will open September 22 for 
lunch from 1 t to 2. and 
dinner hour~ will begin the 
following week. The Coffee 
Hut offers an alternative to 
the rna produced institu-
tional tyle food all loo 
readily available on campus. 
Members of the collective 
thrive on the sense of 
community, the rewarding 
work experience. and the 
discount benefit of food and 
educational material collec-
tively shared with the new 
indicator and the Food Co-op. 

The Food Co-op began two 
years ago with one small 
room, a lot of great ideas and 
massive amounts of hard 
work. Our primary goal is 
that of experiencing conlrol 
of a small part of our lives. 
We are, first and foremost, a 
learning experience in 
democratic management and 
collective deci ion making. 
Providing a healthy supply of 
snax, organic produce, and 
dairy products. we have 
grown to olier twice our 
original capacity. enabling us 
to expand our en'ice and 
carry a much larger selection. 
Come and join us this fall. for 
hard work, healthy food and a 
mall sen 'e of _ elf determina-

tion.

Silly president 
too serious? 
continued from pale 11 
innovative to attract student interest in the 
AS." 

Charlton says he will establish a Silly Person 
of the Month contest and run for Assemblyman 
as the silly write·in candidate. 

AS advisor Randy Woodard says he believes 
Charlton will get sillier as the quarter 
progresses, but warns students who merely 
supported him for his silliness that the AS 
president faces many serious duties . 

"It's hard to be silly over the summer. What 
performer performs well without an audience?" 
said Woodard . 

"Jeremy will continue to approach student 
government with a silly attitude, but the nature 
of his job places constraints upon a person," 
Woodard says. "You must have a certain 
amount of decorum when dealing with 
administrators. Students should consider that 
fact before criticizing his seriousness." 

Most Charlton critics contacted by The Daily 
GlUJrdio" agree that the president has good 
intentions and has potential to truly improve the 
AS. 

"Jeremy's main objective as a silly president, 
to be really visible to students and make them 
less isolated from student government, is 
admirable," says Linda Sabo, president of the 
UC Student Body Presidents Council and a 
presidential contender against Charlton last 
spring. "His silly functions on Revelle Plaza.and 
visits to the dorms will hopefully convmce 
students that the AS is not just another 
administrative group in suits and ties." -

Charlton seems optimistic about doing just 
that and insists that "student government just 
isn't that big a deal. If I can do it, anyone can." 

The AS Council will hold its first meeting of 
the fall Sept. 24 at 6 pm in the North Conference 
Room in the Student Center. Serious and silly 
students alike are welcome to .a,ttend council 
meetings. Calf 452·4450 for more information.

Atkinson takes heat in role 
as new chancellor of UCSD 

not expected a cri i over 
Recombinant ·DNA impro· 
prieties. 

Atkinson had just arrived 
here when the story broke in 
July that UCSD's Dr. Ian 
Kennedy had cloned a 
dangerous and restricted 
virus . Atkmson's reaction: 

are prolific writer . She is 
currently consulting on a 
French language translation 
of one of her texts. And 
Atkinson has six texts to his 
name, the same number of

continued from pelle 2 
post - an outgrowth of the 
now-defunct vice chancellor 
of administration's office. 

A nationwide search is 
what the university might 
want, but Atkinson hasn't 
ruled out drawing his new 
staffer from the "many 
talented people" at UCSD. 

And the buildingof support 
doesn't stop with the new 
budget position. Cushioning 
Atkinson 's introduction to 
chancellor's responsibilities 
i John Miles, acting vice 
chancellor of academic 
affairs. Miles replaces Paul 
Saltman . who served a 
colorful and sometimes 
controversial tenure in the 
office and now teaches 
biology here. 

"I have a feeling of great 
security," he ays of his 
working relationship with 
Miles. ''I'm very pleased with 
him. He has a good attitude 
about advising and tough 
academic programs." 
Although Miles has been 
asked to fill the post for on I y a 
year, Atkinson says he.would 
like Miles to stay longer. 

Miles' appointment may be 
temporary I>ut Atkinson 
hopes that the fresh approach 
Miles brings to his job is 
indicative of things to come 
in the organization of his vice 
chancellor staff. 

Atkinson admits that "a 
chancellor can't be expected 
to do all things." To help 
distribute responsibility and 
keep informed, Atkinson has 
enlisted the services of a 
National Science Foundation 
associate - the same tactic 
taken by predecessor 
McElroy, who also dropped 
an NSF directorship to 
become chancellor of UCSD. 

Bruce Darling, an assis· 
tant to the chancellor, who 
served under Atkinson at 
NSF, is "on loan" from 
Washington to serve as 
Atkinson's project director 
and advisor. 

Speculation circulated on 
campus that Darling would 
be the first of a flood of 
Atkinson's Washington 
associates to be brought here 
to radically r·estructure 
UCSD's administration. But 
Atkinson says he will not 
tum the campus into an 
"NSF West." 

In fact, Atkinson says he is 
trying to divorce himself 
completely from the stigma of 
Washington politics - at 
least for six months. "It's 
hard to say no;" he said after 
refusing an invitation from 
Washington to immediately 
"fly , ou t" and work on 
legislation with Sen. Edward 
Kennedy. Such calls are 
typical, he says. 

While confining himself to 
.,miversity affairs for the time 
being, Atkinson has listed a 
number of high priority tasks 
to complete. 

"Fundraising has to be a 
much bigger part of the 
University of California." 
Atkinson stresses. Increas-
ing private donations to the 
univeraity through an 
expanded community 
relat ions program is probably 
his highest priority. 

Atkin!lOn has not neglected 
students in his list of thinp 
to do, althou,t1 direct contact 
with them ~m to be IesII 

important to him than 
administrative and fund 
raising efforts. 

He doesn't have to look far 
to find a student issue that 
needs his attention, though. 

Richard Atkinson 

UCSD's floundering Affirma· 
tive Action program, another 
gift from the McElroy 
administration , requires 
Atkinson's immediate action 

because the university could 
lose governmental funding if 
minority recruitment 
programs are not improved. 

"No one seems to have 
clear lines of responsibility," 
he says of the program. Ana 
since Atkinson concedes that 
his limited experience at 
UCSD hinder his under· 
standing of the situation, he 
has commissioned Third 
College Provostloe Watson to 
"provide an overview" of 
Affirmative Action and 
report back. 

It i best for another 
administrator to set 
Affirmative Action quotas. 
Atkin son ays , because 
"when things don't work , I 
don 't want to be respon j. 
ble." 

Thi being the case, 
Atkinson feels that Affirma· 
tive Action needs attainable 
goals. "I happen to think that 
setting goals is important, 
but they must be realistic; 
they should be realized," he 
says. 

While Atkinson had 
anticipated difficulties with 
Affirmative Action, he had 

"For two days, I thought 
there might have been the 
possibility of a health hazard . 
There wasn't, of course." 

Beyond that, Atkinson 
doesn't like to say much 
about the incident or its 
investigation. However, he 
con cede that UCSD' 
re earch reputation could be 
irreparably damaged. 

• Perhaps the only consola· 
tion for all the headache that 
h;tve come with the chancel· 
lor hip (as ide from the 
$71 ,000 a year paycheck), is 
the fact that Atkinson has 
mo ved into University 
House, a million·dollar estate 
in La Jolla farms overlooking 
the Pacific. 

Atkinson live there wit h 
his wife, Rita, and finds the 
residence somewhat over· 
whelming. ''I'd just as oon 
live in a condominium," he 
says, explaining that he fears 
someday becoming lost in the 
maze of rooms. 

Both Atkinson and his wife 

Prior to his NSF director· 
ship, Atkinson taught 
applied mathematics, 
statistics, and psychology at 
Stanford University and 
UCLA. 

It has been "quite a 
struggle" for the man who is 
now chancellor of what he 
calls "the toughest univer-
ity in the system." But, 

Atkinson ees himself as well 
establi hed , having survived 
a none·too·easy introduction 
to UCSD .

recalla Gabrelcik. 

"Upon returning to the

another intern," she says, "I 
heard the boss' son 
screaming and we ran in and 
there were these guys 
standing there with a real 
gun, threatening to kill us if 
we called the police. None of 
us was hurt but it was really 
a frightening experience, and 
it made me very conscious of 
the crime and danger that 
exists in that city.'" 

Fortunately, Washington, 
DC is noted for a huge supply 
of free activities. Interns 
attended free concerts in 
local parks, visited endless 
art galleries, museums and 
monuments, watched the 
National Symphony on 
Capitol Lawn and absorbed a 
diverse supply of culture.

lecture," says Gabrelcik, who 
handled problems ranging 
from defective consumer

"The work I did made me

Gabrelcik, who has tentative

you realize that there's 
simply no real power in 
Washington - it's all buried 
under the bureaucracy," he 
says. 

Hufnagel, who had 
considered a career in politics 
prior to his internship, now 
thinks he'll avoid the field. 

Intern Bruce NapelJ who 
worked with Congressman 
Allen Ertel from Pensylvan-
ia, was able to visit the Israeli 
Embassy. Ken Krown, who 
interned for Presidential 
hopeful John Anderson, was 
offered a permanent position 
with the National Unity 
Campaign . Krown was 
unable to accept the offer, 
according to Sigler. 

The ASIO program, 
directed by UCSD undergrad-
uate Jim Lofgren is one of 
three internship programs on 
campus that recently 
combined efforts and divided 
up the internship market to 
reduce program overlap and 
confusion. 

ASIO now handles all 
Washington internships and 
positions in political , 
environmental, and city, 
state and federal govern-
mental fields. Career 
Planning and Placement 
offers students paid 
internships in California 
with private, profit-making 
companies and government 
internships of a technical 
nature, with such organiza-
tions as the Department of 
Agriculture. The Academic 
Internship Program at 
Warren Cotlege helps assign 
interns to agencies dealing 
with legal affairs, health 
services, social services, 
business, communications, 
arts, natural sciences, 

- scientific research and 
education. 

Currently placing students 
in internships in Washing-
ton, Sacramento and San 
Diego, the ASIO hopes to 
expand nationwide and 
eventually internationally . 
Yet Lofgren believes more 
basic goals must be reached 
first. 

".our two primary 
objectives this year are to 
find a permanent source of 
funding (ASIO is currently 
supported by Associated 
Students' monies and by 
fundraisers) and to firmly 
establish our San Di~ and 
Sacramento programs, ' says 
Lofgren. 

Students who wish to 
apply for internships should 
stop by ASIO's new office, at 
least one quarter ahead of the 
desired time of internship. 
Approximately 200 intern· 
ship positions are on file. 
Qualifications for admit-
tance to the program include 
junior level status and a 2.0 
GPA, although exceptions to 
both rules are occasionally 
made. 

ASIO helps applicants 
with resume and letter 
writing, housing, transporta-
tion and interviewirur.

outcomes.) 

Print media representa-
tives are concerned by this 
emergence of the networks. 
but they acknowledge that 
there is no way to beat the 
broadcasters at presenting a 
convention with speed and 
intimacy. 

The networks are also 
taking their role seriously, 
perhaps too seriously. 

Tuesday, August 12, 8:25 
pm - Ted Kennedy ascended 
the podium in the Garden to 
speak on his economic 
proposals. In the NBC news 
booth co-anchorman John 
Chancellor leaned back and 
lit his pipe, knowingthat he'd 
be off·camera for awhile. 

r I II ' 1' .11 1\ .11. 11 eli III 

Convention a 'garden party' 
The delegate's response to 

Kennedy's appearance was 
overw helming. The floor 
filled with bobbing blue-and-
white Kennedy signs and the 
applause sounded like a jet 
taking off. After calling for 
quiet several times, Kennedy 
fi'nally began. 

"My fellow Democrats and 
fellow Americans. I have 
come here tonight not to 
argue for a candidacy, but to 
affirm a cause ... " 

Up in the booth, Chancellor 
watched - but not through 
the studio's huge glass wall 
that afforded an almost total 
vista of the Garden and a 
fairly close view of the 
podium. Instead he was 

int~ntly watching Kennedy's 
image flicker on the studio 
monitor in the corner of the 
room. 

When co-anchorman David 
Brinkley, casually smoking a 
cigarette. entered and joined 
him behind the news desk, 
Chancellor looked up 
tentatively and exchanged a 
few words with him, then 
went back to the screen. 
Throughout Kennedy's 
speech - almost 40 minutes 
- Chancellor never once 
looked at the world beyond 
his glass wall. He saw no 
more of the speech, and the 
reaction it drew. than did any 
of NBC 's millions of viewers. 

There was a 45-minute 

demostration after Ken -
nedy 's speech. Amid frenzied 
activit yon the floor. Kennedy 
delegates from California 
uprooted the state signpost. 
formed a roughly single·file 
line and began snaking 
around the delegation area. 
Through New Mexico ' s 
delegation, past the District 
of Columbia and finally to 
Wyoming across the floor. 
the delegates whooped and 
danced. Then the band broke 
into a rousing version of 
"Johnny B. Goode" and the 
giant screen above the 
podium flashed pictures of 
Bella A bzug, doing her best to 
boogie in the aisles. 

Back at NBC. Chancellor, 

51 

after a brief di cus ion on a 
red phone. leaned forward 
with his hands supporting 
his chin. puffing his pipe and 
still watching the monitor. 

Television, for John 
Chancellor anyway, had 
"scooped" real life. 
A trade-off 

The politicians themelves 
had no choice but to take the 
networks' power into 
account . 

On the convention's final 
day, Kennedy and Carter 
forces still bargained over the 
wording of the president's 
appraisal of the party 
platform . Late in the 
afternoon, desperate to buy 
more time. two Kennedy 
aides threatened (in the

As a last resort for food on

contracted a concessions 
company to operate vending 
machines at locations 
throughout campus. loca-

almost everyone had filed out

mostly rookie delegates, 
young reporters and general

remained understood and 
joined in, until there were 
about 500 voices echoing in 
the Garden's rafters. Finally

Cronkite, who had just

Meal card 
continued from page 20 

The meal card allowance 
for smick bars has gone up a 
little from last year, at $1.50 
for breakfast, $2.10 for lunch 
and $2.45 for dinner. Snack 
bars are not open on 
weekends. 

If a meal card (either loaner 
or standard) is lost or 
misplaced, call the meal card 
office first, so that they can 
keep a lookout for it. 
Replacements cost $10, and a 
new picture can be taken in 
the meal card office. 

Prices for "guests" who eat 
in the cafeterias have gone up 
too, and the increase is not 
consistant with the purchase 
power of the cards in the 
snack bars. Breakfasts now 
cost $1.95, lunch is $2.75 ad 
dinner is $4 for a regular mea\.
