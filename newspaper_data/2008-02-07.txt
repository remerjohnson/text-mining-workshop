More than a year has passed since former Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson’s 
report and analysis of the residential security offi-
cer program was released in Fall Quarter 2006, 
but neither his successor nor student leaders 
committed to the issue have made strides toward 
bridging the gap between RSOs and the UCSD 
student body.

Watson’s report — criticized by former A.S. 
President Harry Khanna as largely ornamental — 
indicated that one of the primary grievances that 
students held against RSOs was their enforcement 
of state and university underage drinking policies, 
a role that would normally be handled by resident 
advisers, as seen at other UC campuses. 

The report went on to state that in order to 
reduce on-campus alcohol consumption, and 
thereby improve RSOs’ reputation within the 
student community, an outreach effort would 
have to focus on four primary goals: education, 
communication, consistency and commitment. 
However, Watson’s office, which he vacated upon 
his retirement in June, has not been working on 
the issue this year.

Watson said he was unable to comment on the 
current relationship between RSOs and students. 

“I believe it is inappropriate for me to make 
any comments on the RSO program at this time 
regardless of whether the comments relate to 
events or actions that are pre- or post-June 2007,” 
Watson said in an e-mail. 

Current Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue was also unable to reveal any outreach 
efforts that could have been undertaken following 
the report’s release.

While the process of amending the campus 
advocacy policy is ongoing, University Centers 
officials have defined their own free-speech 
code — limiting the activity of community 

members in Price Center and splicing the rules 
for campus assembly.

After several weeks of meeting with student 
organizations, the three student representatives 
on the committee, charged with revising the 
campus outdoor space and distribution policy, 
submitted their preliminary proposal on Jan. 
31. Unbeknownst to many, however, members

Californians voted en masse to 
oppose Proposition 92 on Feb. 6, a 
controversial initiative that would 
have benefited the state’s community 
colleges by increasing funding and 
lowering fees in an attempt to make 
them more accessible.

If passed, Proposition 92 would 
have implemented a number of 
changes to California’s community 
colleges: gaining independence from 
state politics, lowering unit fees by 
$5 and limiting future increases to 
no more than the cost of living. 

The item’s proponents estimated 
an increase of $300 million in funding 
and maintained this could be done 
without greatly affecting other educa-
tional funding or raising taxes.

The initiative, however, was 
greatly opposed by organizations 
such as the California Taxpayer’s 
Association, California Teachers 
Association and the University of 
California, which believed the prop-
osition would “lock up” the state’s 

general fund and lead to an increase 
in fees or reduction in funding for 
other government services at a time 
when the state is already facing a 
major fiscal deficit.

Proposition 92 was ultimately 
defeated after receiving only 37 per-
cent of the vote, which its supporters 
attributed to bad timing. 

“Obviously, we’re disappointed,” 
said Jennifer Wonnacott, official 
spokeswoman for the group Yes on 
Proposition 92.

However, Wonnacott said she 
finds some consolation in the knowl-
edge that the issue forced communi-
ty college issues to the state’s political 
forefront.

“The whole campaign has made 
one thing clear,” she said. “The story 
has now been told about the mis-
treatment and underfunding of com-
munity colleges.” 

Dian Hasson, director of higher 
education for the California Teachers 
Association and teacher at Butte 
Community College, agreed that 
timing was a factor in the result.

Though she opposed the mea-
sure, Hasson said the state’s project-
ed $14.5-billion budget deficit made 
the item’s timing not “optimal.”

month of his proposed budget for 
the 2009 fiscal year, Gov. Arnold

President George W. Bush released his 
2009 budget proposal on Feb. 4 amid a slew of 
criticisms by college and university officials 
nationwide.

The budget calls for extreme cutbacks in 
appropriations for minority- and low-income-
serving grant programs, completely eliminat-
ing government funding for 47 programs and 
cutting back on many more. The Perkins Loan 
program, Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships 
and the Leveraging Education Assistance 
Partnerships programs have all been com-
pletely removed from the new budget for 
being “duplicative, narrowly focused or unable 
to demonstrate effectiveness.”

A $23-million cut from tribally controlled 
colleges and an $18-million cut from institu-
tions defined as Hispanic-serving under Title 
V of the Higher Education Act — among 
other reductions — have elicited criticism 
from individuals who call the move unfair 
and say it takes money away from the most 
needy students.

“The funds are woefully inadequate to 
ensure that minority students stay in and 
graduate from college,” Selena Singleton, the 
director of policy, advocacy and government 
relations for the National Association for 
Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, said 
in a statement. “With the cost of a college 
education increasing, a looming recession

and an increasingly global economy, [these 
programs] are the only way to ensure that a 
college degree is an attainable goal for more 
students.”

In the past, similar program eliminations 
proposed by Bush have resulted in Congress’s 
declining to fulfill the request.

On the other side, the cuts in these pro-
grams have ensured a $2.6-billion increase 
to the Pell Grant Program, the biggest source 
of financial aid for low-income students. The 
raise would offer $69 more to each student per 
grant awarded, raising the maximum award 
allocation to $4,800.

U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret 
Spellings said in a statement that the presi-
dent’s proposal appropriately addresses the 
priorities of students. 

“I am pleased the budget calls for increased 
funding for Pell Grants, Title I and IDEA,” 
she said. “All of these programs are essential 
to ensuring that our children not only have 
access to a rigorous education, but one suited 
for the global economy.”

However, the maximum Pell Grant award 
still falls $300 short of the sum Bush promised 
to implement in his 2000 presidential cam-
paign, and UC Office of the President spokes-
man in Washington, D.C. Chris Harrington 
said that a $69 increase is not a sufficient 
tradeoff for the cuts to other programs.

POORLY DRAWN LINES

History Professor Named 
New Sixth College Provost 

Science historian Naomi 
Oreskes has been appointed to 
serve as provost of UCSD’s Sixth 
College, effective July 1. 

A professor of history and sci-
ence studies and UCSD faculty 
member since 1998, Oreskes is 
known for her seminal work deal-
ing with the science of climate 
change, specifically on the soci-
etal framing and reception of the 
scientific consensus on global 
warming.

“Professor Oreskes’ exten-
sive interdisciplinary research 
and teaching on issues related 
to science, technology and cul-
ture, along with her administrative 
experience and strong commit-
ment to undergraduate education, 
make her exceptionally well-suit-
ed to lead Sixth College,” Senior 
Vice Chancellor for Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake said in a press 
release. “I am delighted that she 
has accepted this important and 
challenging position.”

Oreskes’ research focuses on 
the historical development of sci-
entific knowledge and methods 
and practices in the earth and 
environmental sciences. Her 2004 
essay, “The Scientific Consensus 
on Climate Change,” led to edito-
rial pieces in publications such 
as the Washington Post and the 
San Francisco Chronicle and was 
cited in the Academy Award-win-
ning film “An Inconvenient Truth.”

“I am very pleased and excited 
to be named provost of Sixth 
College,” Oreskes said in a press 
release. “It’s a privilege to be 

associated with a college that 
is so young and fresh, and the 
college’s theme of culture, art and 
technology resonates with the 
issues I’ve been concerned with 
throughout my academic career.”

UC Awarded $11.5 Million 
in Enron-Related Lawsuit

The University of California 
announced this week that it had 
reached an $11.5-million settle-
ment with Goldman Sachs & Co. on 
behalf of investors who purchased 
the 7 percent Exchangeable 
Notes issued by Enron Corp. The 
plaintiffs had accused Goldman 
Sachs of violating Section 11 of 
the Securities Act of 1933 for mar-
keting the notes through a false 
registration statement. 

The notes were exchangeable 
for Enron Oil and Gas Co. stock. 
The settlement covers purchases 
of the 7 percent Exchangeable 
Notes from the date of their issu-
ance until Dec. 2, 2001, when 
Enron filed for bankruptcy.

The university filed claims 
against Goldman Sachs in the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern 
District of Texas in 2004. The 
settlement has been approved by 
the UC Board of Regents and is 
subject to court approval on Feb. 
29. 

The UC system has obtained 
more than $7.2 billion in settle-
ments for Enron investors to date, 
including $2.4 billion from Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce, $2.2 
billion from JPMorgan Chase, $2 
billion from Citigroup, $222.5 mil-
lion from Lehman Brothers and $69 
million from Bank of America.

at this time,” she said.
During his election campaign last 

year, A.S. President Marco Murillo 
promised to re-evaluate Watson’s 
study and conduct his own in an 
attempt to better understand how 
to bridge the divide between RSOs 
and the student community. Murillo 
said he has plans to follow up on this 
promise, but has not made any prog-
ress so far this year.

“Unfortunately, I have not had any 
time to address this issue just yet,” 
Murillo said. “However, I do intend 
on determining what kind of role an 
evaluation program can play in this 
process and what kinds of new prac-
tices can be put in place.”

Murillo said that a shift in respon-
sibility from RSOs to RAs regarding 
the enforcement of underage drink-
ing would also help the reputation of 
RSOs within the student body.

“The RSOs’ purpose is to ensure 
student safety,” he said. “I think that 
the problem is that a lot of students 
feel that RSOs have overstepped their 
boundaries and have taken on more 
of a parental role. Each building is 
assigned an RA. If students need any-
thing, RAs are there as a guide, and 
if anything is a serious problem, RAs 
need to hear about it.” 

Despite Rue and Murillo’s appar-
ent lack of progress, head university 
spokeswoman Stacie A. Spector said 

the RSO program has actually under-
gone numerous changes since that 
time. 

“RSOs play a critical role in pro-
viding safety and security to our 
residents and yes, significant effort 
has been made to improve relations 
with students,” she said in an e-mail. 
“The coordination and communi-
cation between all parties involved 
in the residential experience will 
continue, as will exploring concerns 
students raise of an overly legalistic 
culture.”

Spector said these changes includ-
ed new RSO uniforms to minimize 
“feelings of intimidation” so that RSOs 
would appear more approachable.

The officers have also participat-
ed in more of the training given to 
RAs and housing advisers, as well 
as campus-specific meetings with 
Residential Life staff.

“Starting fall of 2007, RSOs have 
participated in RA and HA training 
at all six colleges to ensure consis-
tency in customer service throughout 
the RSO program and all six college 
residences,” she said.

UCSD Police Sgt. Yolanda Smith, 
who heads the RSO program along 
with Lt. David Rose, expressed a 
more positive view of the current 
relationship between RSOs and the 
student body. 

“We run the RSO program, so 
maybe we have a bit of a biased 

opinion, but I think most of the stu-
dent body understands why we are 
needed,” Smith said. “We are here 
to protect the student body, and as 
a result of that comes a need for 
enforcement.”

Smith said that the RSO pro-
gram, which is not common among 
University of California campuses, 
attempts to work in unison with 
RAs to ensure that student safety is 
upheld. 

“Our primary responsibility is 
safety, but enforcement is an essential 
part of that responsibility,” she said. 
“I believe the RSO report represents 
only a small percentage of students 
who see RSOs negatively. I feel the 
community as a whole appreciates 
what we do. As far as I am concerned 
that was a very small percentage.” 

Smith also acknowledged the fact 
that those responsible for enforce-
ment of rules and regulations are 
often the ones who most fall under 
criticism and stringent evaluation. 

“I understand that law enforce-
ment gets a bad rep, that there are 
bad apples everywhere, but unfor-
tunately that is the price we have to 
pay for being in this job,” she said. 
“Unfortunately, we have to be part of 
things that are not going to go over 
well with everybody.”

Schwarzenegger outlined his plan 
for drastic budget cuts to nearly all 
state-funded departments and pro-
grams in an attempt to combat the 
declared fiscal emergency. 

These cuts include funding 
reductions for all public educa-
tion institutions within the state, 
encompassing community colleges, 
the UC system and the CSU system. 
The budget suggests a total reduc-
tion of $291.7 million for commu-
nity college general apportionment 
funds.

Hasson said supporters of the 

proposition may not have realized 
the opposition it would face during 
such a financially unstable time.

Nonetheless, Hasson said she is 
optimistic about the future of higher 
education in California, calling it “a 
real economic engine for the state.”

“All higher education needs bet-
ter funding,” she said. “This is my 
main criticism of Prop. 92.”

The UC Board of Regents, who 
openly challenged Proposition 92, 
expressed similar concerns. UC 
Office of the President spokesman 
Ricardo Vazquez said that increased 
teamwork is necessary to improve 

the situation.
“It is important for all higher edu-

cation to work together and present 
one voice to Sacramento,” he said.

Supporters of Proposition 92 
said they remain hopeful despite the 
vote’s outcome.

Wonnacott reassured her support-
ers and students who will be affected 
by the decision, saying that that its 
proponents will continue to fight for 
“accessibility and affordability” in the 
state’s higher education.

Backers Shift Focus to Future of  Higher Education
▶ PROPOSITION, from page 1

Councilmembers confronted two largely unanticipated issues at last night’s meeting. 
An unscheduled presentation peti-
tioned the A.S. Council for some siz-
able funding, while a proposed consti-
tutional amendment met considerable 
resistance and was left unresolved.

Members of the Emerging Leaders 
Program spoke to the council during 
public input to show off plans for their 
final project, despite the fact that their 
request for funding had not yet been 
considered by the finance committee 
and was not on the council’s agenda. 
The impromptu presentation appeared 
to catch most councilmembers off 
guard, as it was complete with pro-
jected budgetary needs, timeline and 
explanatory handouts.

The leaders-in-training walked 
councilmembers through their pro-
spective plans for 
the event they wish 
to host, which curi-
ously focused on a 
theme of “the seven 
vices.” In addition 
to holding a con-
cert and dance on 
May 9, the emer-
gent leaders explained how a prideful 
photo booth and a vain makeup booth 
in Price Center would carry the theme, 
among other vice booths.

Leadership in action doesn’t 
come cheap: The so-called “Night of 
Mayhem” carried an $8,000 price tag. 
The council’s reaction to the request 
was unclear, but the finance committee 
will have to make its own recommen-
dation later.

The surprise funding presentation 
faded into the background later in the 
meeting when an innocuous-sound-
ing amendment to the council’s stand-
ing rules fueled a prolonged discussion 
about political theory.

The amendment specified an action 
plan for handling council elections 
ending in a tie. Under the current vot-
ing system, which was recently updat-
ed to include instant runoff voting, 
TritonLink would randomly select a 
winner between two first-place can-
didates.

The proposed amendment would 
change the rules so that if two candi-
dates tied after a runoff vote, the winner 
would be selected by a majority vote of 
the outgoing council. The similarity 
to the U.S. Constitution was uncanny 
— if two presidential candidates evenly 
split votes in the Electoral College, the 
choice is left to a vote in the House of 
Representatives.

After some councilmembers raised 
objections to the amendment, Price 
Center Ballroom transformed into 
Independence Hall, and the council 
began its own 30-minute version of the 
Philadelphia Convention.

Objections centered primarily 
around the appropriateness of involv-
ing councilmembers in choosing 
their direct successors, a situation 
that would potentially allow “slate 
politics” to persuade councilmem-

bers to unfairly 
pick one candidate 
over another in 
the event of a tied 
runoff election.

“This isn’t the 
federal govern-
ment,” Thurgood 
Marshall College 

Senator Kyle Samia said. “I don’t think 
you can even claim we’re going to be 
impartial.”

All-Campus Senator Meghan Clair 
also cautioned against the council’s 
apparent willingness to act in situations 
demanding impartiality.

“We need to remove ourselves from 
conflicts like these,” she said.

Sixth College Senator John Cressey 
amended the amendment to call for 
unlimited runoff elections, based on 
the improbability of repeated ties. His 
proposal failed.

Biological Sciences Senator Emma 
Sandoe pointed out that the previous 
standing rules never included a provi-
sion for tied elections, an oversight that 
failed to drag the council down into a 
constitutional tailspin.

Ultimately, the council could not 
agree on a way to improve upon James 
Madison’s flawed logic and voted to 
reconsider the matter at a later meet-
ing.

2009] budget proposal to freeze or 
eliminate these vital programs,” he 
said. “UC supports increasing the 
federal investment in student finan-
cial aid programs, such as SEOG, 
Perkins Loans, LEAP, GAANN and 
Javits.” 

The budget does call for major 
increases to graduate aid programs, 
including $24 million allocated to the 
new Advancing America Through 
Foreign Language Partnerships, a 
program that aims to create a more 
comprehensive American educa-
tion. 

Spellings said these increases 
will ease the financial burden on 
students.

“Higher education is more expen-
sive and more necessary for future 
success than ever before,” Spellings 
said. “This budget provides the nec-
essary resources for critical pro-
grams that equip American students 
with the skills they need to compete 
and succeed in the knowledge-based 
economy.”

Harrington echoed Spellings’ 
goal of student success, but he said 
that instead of small increases paired 
with selected cuts, more widespread 

expansion of federal aid programs 
is required in order to maximize 
affordability.

“Almost half the UC student 
body — more than 90,000 students 
— receives federal financial aid,” 
he said. “UC supports significant 
increases in these programs to 
meet students’ needs and to further 
expand access and opportunity for 
low-income students in postsecond-
ary education, as well as for those 
pursuing graduate education.”

UC Officials Oppose President’s Proposed Cuts

Price Center, a key free-speech area on 
campus, months earlier.

According to Carol-Irene 
Southworth, an A.S. Council repre-
sentative to the committee, members 
spent many long hours talking with 
student groups, dissecting current leg-
islation regarding First-Amendment 
rights on college campuses and evalu-
ating the revision released last June 
to lay down the policy principles by 
which the final version must abide.

The current document was inten-
tionally written broadly, Southworth 
said, to protect the campus commu-
nity’s freedoms as much as possible 
before fleshing out all the details.

“We wanted to start where peo-
ple have all their rights all the time,” 
Southworth said. “If there do need to 
be specifications made, we need to be 
careful that it doesn’t get restrictive.”

While the old policy was accused 
of being unconstitutional for ham-
pering student speech and assembly, 
restricting the political activity of 
faculty and staff and separating the 
campus into free-speech zones, the 
current document promises not to 
“infringe the rights of any member 
of the university community or com-
munity at-large.”

However, the rights of commu-
nity members in Price Center could 
come into question under a new Price 
Center Plaza Limited Public Forum 
Policy the University Centers Advisory 
Board approved Nov. 7.

While Price Center has tradition-
ally been managed as a programming 
and dining area, rather than standard 
outdoor space, the existing University 
Centers policy was vague, according 
to UCAB Chair Matthew Bright. The 
committee, comprised mostly of stu-
dents, decided to update the policy, 
having University Centers administra-
tors write it based on UCAB recom-
mendations.

There was much debate within 

Chair: Price Center for Students, Not Nonaffiliates
▶ SPEECH, from page 1 UCAB about allowing people unaf-

filiated with the university to assem-
ble in Price Center, Bright said, but 
the board ultimately agreed that only 
UCSD students, faculty and staff with 
valid identification are allowed to 
engage in public speaking activities 
in the plaza.

The reason driving this restriction is 
safety, according to UCAB Vice Chair 
Lana Blank, who said that the policy 
is intended to protect students from 
being bulldozed by outside groups.

“We felt like a lot of groups who 
have absolutely no affiliation with the 
university have no obligation to follow 

the rules we set up,” Blank said in an 
e-mail. “We feel like the Price Center 
is for UCSD, not just anyone.”

UCAB member Arian Mashhood 
recalled the activity of nonaffiliated 
religious groups who would often 
preach in Price Center last year, set-
ting off complaints from diners and 
facing consequences due to alleged 
free-speech violations.

“I don’t want to be screamed at 
while I’m eating lunch and be told I’m 
going to hell,” Mashhood said.

While the campus community may 
have precedence over outsiders, the 
revision committee wants to eliminate 
the distinction between affiliates and 
nonaffiliates in order to keep the uni-
versity open to the public, Graduate 

Student Association committee repre-
sentative Benjamin Balthaser said.

Balthaser added that the new lim-
ited public forum policy may result in 
confusion amid the revamping of the 
general outdoor-space policy.

“Our intent is that there will be 
one policy covering everything to 
avoid confusion and to avoid back-
door ways to prohibit free speech,” 
Balthaser said. “Most people in the 
university are under the impression 
that there is one policy, not deeper 
policies that the university is implic-
itly or explicitly keeping quiet.”

While Price Center currently 
remains separate from the outdoor-
space policy, the committee is inter-
ested in including it in the new revi-
sion, Southworth said.

Other changes to the policy include 
a nonmandatory reservation system, 
in which a reservation is an optional 
method for student organizations to 
secure a space. There is also a stipu-
lation requiring student representa-
tion for any future revisions of the 
policy and a clause limiting University 
Centers’ authority over Library Walk.

The student representatives are 
awaiting feedback from student 
organizations, the A.S. Council, the 
Foundation for Individual Rights in 
Education and the American Civil 
Liberties Union. The committee plans 
to reunite Feb. 14 to voice opinions 
about the new proposal.

The student leadership in this 
process marks a unique opportunity 
for UCSD, according to Southworth, 
which allows the university to be an 
example for other campuses.

“Eventually we do want to have a 
model free-speech policy,” Southworth 
said. “We want to have something 
that’s groundbreaking, a really solid 
way to write a free-speech policy for 
a university.”

EDITORIAL BOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the University 
of California at San Diego. Contents © 2007. Views expressed 
herein represent the majority vote of the editorial board and are 
not necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD 

or the members of the Guardian staff. 

Although university officials eventually did the right thing by granting the Food 
Co-op full rent abatement last week, 
their decision is nothing more than a 
weakly veiled public-relations move. 
Clearly wanting to prevent a larger 
student backlash, administrators 
agreed to honor the co-op’s master 
space agreement only after mem-
bers brought the issue in person 
before the A.S. Council. University 
Centers Director Paul Terzino said 
that because the amount in question 
was relatively low — just over $1,000 
— campus administrators felt it best 
not to use up everyone’s time by 
allowing the council to form a com-
mittee to investigate and mediate 
the issue.

But if time was really the con-
cern, why did officials waste the last 
year refusing to honor the MSA?

Administrators need to get their 
act together and start advocating 
student rights, instead of work-
ing against them. The Food Co-
op is student-run and nonprofit, 
and its laidback anticommercial 
atmosphere provides one of the last 
sanctuaries for those at UCSD seek-
ing relief from overcrowded Price 
Center. But university-sponsored 
construction has hampered sales, 

and near-extortion from officials 
has only further hurt the co-op over 
this past year. 

But what stings the most about 
the entire debacle is that the 
University Centers Advisory Board 
— which, rather than the A.S. 
Council, is charged with mediat-
ing co-op issues should they arise 
— failed to come to the co-op’s aid. 
Instead, Meghan Clair, all-campus 
senator and student UCAB rep-
resentative, spoke out against the 
Food Co-op at the council’s Jan. 23 
meeting. Who, if not our student 
representatives, will rally for student 
organizations against administrative 
bullying?

At least students can be thank-
ful for representatives like Vice 
President of Student Life Donna 
Bean and Vice President of External 
Affairs Dorothy Young, who both 
spoke out in favor of the co-ops 
when the issue was brought to their 
attention. 

Seeing the council form a com-
mittee to address the situation, offi-
cials must have felt a fire brewing 
and decided to put it out fast by 
finally granting rent abatement. But 
Terzino and his gang should have fol-
lowed the MSA from the start, rather 
than playing unfair — and totally 

inappropriate — power games. The 
co-op should have been granted full 
rent abatement immediately, not 
after a year of struggle that forced its 
members to visit the A.S. Council. 

And while it is good to see justice 
finally served, the amount of arguing 
and effort it took to get the univer-
sity to abide by its own agreement is 
alarming. Officials should be driven 
by more than the threat of bad pub-
licity; let’s hope in the future they 
start acting for, rather than against, 
the students they’re supposed to be 
serving. 

The higher education sphere captured only small victo-ries in President George W. 
Bush’s national budget proposal, 
which is still a grim picture for the 
waning scene of college accessibil-
ity, affordability and quality. 

While horns sounded for the 
biggest of those victories — Bush 
pumping $2.6 billion into federal 
Pell Grant coffers — the overall 
budget resembled a budgetary 
stalemate for college officials.

Where the Pell Grant gained, 
other programs lost. To free up 
funding for the Pell Grant, the 
Perkins Loan, a reduced-interest 
loan for lower-income students, 
was marked for elimination (as 
Bush did last year), along with a 
handful of other programs serving 
poor students.

Patting himself on the back, 
Bush spoke highly of his Pell Grant 
boost, one of the largest and most 
lucrative grants available to low-
income college students. In fact, his 
adoration rung so deeply that he 

jumped at the chance to expand the 
grant into another self-purported 
bright idea: Pell Grant Jr. The pro-
posed program, named Pell Grants 
for Kids, opens up $300 million 
for high achieving children in low 
performing K-12 schools. 

As with the Pell Grant, the chil-
dren will be able to use their awards 
flexibly, and with this new program 
attend any private school of their 
choice.

But how will little ol’ Pell Grant 
Jr. pay for the towering college 
tuition that he will undoubtedly 
want, once he’s done enjoying free 
private school? If Bush is able to 
bypass heavy congressional protest 
over his budget, the Supplemental 
Educational Opportunity Grant 
will be axed. The grant is admin-
istered directly by campus finan-
cial aid offices, as are the Perkins 
Loans. But now, Bush has decidedly 
focused the fiscal spotlight on fed-
eral holdings.

In a call to the national press, 
Secretary of Education Margaret 

Spellings said Bush was sticking to 
his Pell Grant guns, using “tried-
and-true” as a measuring stick to 
tackle problems of college afford-
ability. 

The Pell Grant, she said, was 
tapped as one of the most success-
ful programs, and was budgeted 
as one. Its success was lauded to 

the point that Pell Grant for Kids 
was born. But the award increase 
each student would see from Bush’s 
proposal and the impact Pell Grant 
for Kids could possibly make on 
accessibility are both negligible, 
compared to the chokehold college 
finances already have over today’s 
students.

Win a Little, Lose a Little: A Familiar Fight for College Budgeting

ILLUSTRATIONS BY MICHAEL CAPPARELLI/GUARDIAN

I have lived in La Jolla for almost a year and a half now, but it wasn’t until last weekend that I 
fully felt the magnitude of my new 
abode. Torrey Pines Golf Course 
played host to the Buick Invitational, 
a professional golf tournament that 
drew some of the golf world’s biggest 
names and induced the greater La 
Jolla demographic to cut short their 
monthly trip to Fiji to catch a few 
rounds.

Now don’t get me wrong, I love 
golf. I am by no means even a scratch 
golfer, but whenever I hit the links I 
am guaranteed a good time and can 
hold my own. But for as much golf as 
I have played in my life, I had never 
before gotten the chance to watch the 
world’s best golfers at a professional 
event. So when my cousin called and 
told me that he had two tickets for 
us to watch the invitational, I was 
pumped. 

The morning of the tournament, 
I decided that since this was my 
first pro-golf experience, I wanted 
to try and look like I belonged in 
the crowd. Opening up my closet 
made me realize that my lack of 
pleated khakis and Lacoste polos 
would surely keep me from blend-
ing in with the sleekly dressed and 
high-class spectators. I ended up 
sporting a collared shirt under a 
windbreaker, which I thought was 
classy but not too showy. When my 
cousin greeted my appearance with 
a deep, loud, roaring belly laugh I 
knew that I was going to have a long 
day ahead of me.

Aside from my fears of being 
arrested by the La Jolla fashion 
police, I was really excited as we 
walked up to the entrance to Torrey 
Pines. My excitement turned to con-
fusion when, as we were waiting 
to pick up our tickets, an usher 
approached us and asked to see our

A.S. COUNCIL — With the recent 
development of the Intercollegiate 
Football Feasibility Task Force — a 
group which will analyze both the 
negatives and the positives of found-
ing a campus football team — UCSD 
finally seems to be taking a step 
toward the establishment of a team. 
Students may hope that, with this 
step, the Price Center shirts that jok-
ingly read, “UCSD Tritons football 
— still undefeated!” can become a 
reality. Unfortunately, after all the 
evidence is produced, students will 
be disappointed to find that it would 
be virtually impossible to establish a 
football team due to the budgetary 
constrictions and lack of student 
commitment.

One of the most important issues 
regarding the development of a foot-
ball team stems from its cost. As 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said 
at the Nov. 1 A.S. Council meeting, 
a team would cost more than the 
previous $1-million prediction. For 
example, Division-I program schools 
spend at most about $100 million, 
while according to UC Davis’ pro-
gram site, its Division-II team spent 
approximately $31 million just on a 
stadium. 

With the slated $400-million cut 
in state funding to the UC system, 
it is obvious that the belt-tighten-
ing measures that are now being 
taken by the UC Board of Regents 
would leave no room in the athletics 
department’s budget for a football 
program. With last year’s referen-
dum requiring students to pay for 
some athletic programs, the school 
clearly would not have enough 
money to pay for a team — unless 
another referendum forces students 
to pay for it again.

Even if a referendum were to be 

proposed, having students pay for a 
new football team may not be a piece 
of cake. Although last year’s referen-
dum squeaked out an approval from 
students, the last three attempts to 

pass a referendum to bring back the 
once disbanded 1968 team have all 
failed. With students already paying 
over $300 each year due to last year’s 
fee increases, another supported ref-

erendum seems extremely unlikely. 
But there are even more com-

plications. During the Jan. 20 A.S. 
Council meeting, when asked if she 
was willing to meet with the task 
force, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue agreed but 
warned that there were more hidden 
problems in the establishment of a 
football team than just feasibility.

Incentive is necessary in any 
financial situation. It may be pos-
sible to create and fund a football 
team, but if there is no funding 
incentive, there is no reason for 
the school to invest in it. The vice 
chancellor listed infrequent games 
as one of the apparent problems. An 
average football team plays approxi-
mately 10 to 12 games during the 
regular season, with a few more if 
the team were to make it to the play-
offs. But weak attendance, similar to 
what the existing Triton teams face, 
would prove disastrous. In this situ-

ation, balancing costs and benefits 
is crucial and a team that neither 
generates revenue nor fan support 
hardly carries incentive.

A visit to any one of UCSD’s 
sports games would highlight the 
difficulties in attempting to cre-
ate a football team. Many games 
get less than 10 spectators, which 
clearly reflects the apathetic atti-
tude students have for Triton sports. 
Even mainstream sports like base-
ball — despite being ranked 15th 
in Division II and a favorite to fin-
ish first in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, according to its 
coaches — are not receiving much 
attention from students. This simple 
statistic shows: A developing foot-
ball team wouldn’t get much love 
from students.   

Another problem lies within the 
issue of gender equity. It generally

cell phones. My cell phone — you’re 
kidding me, right?

At first I thought that maybe it 
was a really forward sales pitch for 
T-Mobile or some other tournament 
sponsor, but then, with a stern gri-
mace, he instructed us to go wait in 
another line to check our phones. 
We weren’t just supposed to put our 
phones on silent, but actually check 
them in with the tournament orga-
nizers, rendering us phone-less and 
disconnected for the whole day. But 
I was also without time; since my 
phone doubles as my watch, I can’t 
exactly create a makeshift sundial on 
the course to figure out what time 
it was.

Being the San Francisco rebel 
that I am, I refused to conform to 
the  Man’s demands, and my cousin 
and I quickly snuck past the guards, 
secretly pocketing the portable cel-
lular devices. The adrenaline rush 
that accompanied my contraband 
soon subsided when we entered the 
tournament and were greeted by a 
pristine, beautiful course above the 
Torrey Pines cliffs overlooking the 
ocean. 

For the next few hours we walked 
the course, trying to see as many dif-
ferent golfers and holes as we could 
before our legs tired out. Watching 
Tiger Woods is a thing of beauty and, 
aside from the fact that he looked 

smaller than he does on TV, it was 
amazing being so close to such a 
prominent sports figure. What was 
even more fun than watching Tiger 
was following the no-names for a 
couple of holes. These guys were 
just happy to be on the same course 
as Tiger, Phil Mickelson and Vijay 
Singh, and were able to interact with 
the crowd a whole lot more, exchang-
ing jokes and comments with fans 
between shots.

Being part of the gallery was, 
however, one of the more mixed 
experiences of my life. It was great 
being so close to the action, but I 
just felt damn awkward surrounded 
by the upper echelons of La Jolla 
society. Normally I have no prob-
lem being around different classes 
of people, but that day, the over-
abundance of golf visors, $20 drinks 

takes about 80 players, including 
staff, in order to start a football team 
— just do the math. 

There are 11 players in both the 
offensive and the defensive units, 
along with about seven coaches 
for each position: the head coach, 
offensive coordinator, defensive 
coordinator and special teams coach 
along with about 
two or three 
assistants. So, 
including sec-
ond- and third-
string players, 
the numbers add 
up fast. In almost 
every university 
football team 
— including 
UCLA, USC and 
UC Berkeley, the 
players are over-
whelmingly  male. Title IX, which 
requires schools have an equal 
number of athletic opportunities for 
both genders, would then cause a 
problem. Since statistics show that 
women are less likely to participate 
in football, the school would need 
to accommodate at least three more 
athletic teams that would appeal to 
women. That means more teams 

would need to be funded by the 
already stretched budget. 

The IFFT’s attempt to research 
the feasibility of a football team 
is a remarkable and commendable 
effort, but sadly the evidence will 
only show the obvious: UCSD does 
not have enough money, support or 
incentive to establish a viable foot-
ball team.

Sure, having a 
football team may 
boost spirit and 
facilitate recre-
ational opportu-
nities, but these 
small benefits are 
a long time com-
ing and give little 
to overcome the 
insurmountable 
startup problems. 
So, instead of hop-
ing for a football 

team, the best thing students can 
do is to involve themselves in the 
other numerous existing teams on 
campus. School athletics does not 
start and end with football; sports 
such as rugby offer similar strategy 
and intensity.

and veneers pushed me over the 
edge. I had never been to a sporting 
event where the fans tried as hard as 
they could to look exactly like the 
athletes. I also kept getting weird 
looks from people; maybe my wind-
breaker and jeans combo wasn’t up 
to par with the mandated dress code 
of FootJoy shoes, Titleist shirts and 
Callaway hats. 

Besides feeling suffocated by the 
corporate sponsorships that choked 
every open space on the course, I 
was content with my first pro-golf 
experience. I had spent the afternoon 
watching golf at its best, saw some 
amazing shots and kept my morals 
intact — and I didn’t give in and buy 
the $12 Polish sausage that tempted 
me all day long. Most importantly, 
though, I dodged the ever-watching 
eyes of the tournament security force 
and even slipped my phone out for a 
few minutes to call my mom. 

Apparently my upper-class cos-
tume was better than I thought, and I 
had been able to trick the crowds into 
thinking that I was one of them, thus 
making myself invisible and allow-
ing my illegal phone use. The 2008 
U.S. Open is coming to Torrey Pines 
in June, and maybe I’ll buy myself a 
nice pair of slacks and a golf polo, 
then walk into the tournament with 
a cell phone and a camera hidden on 
me, along with a Philly cheese steak 
or something else yummy to eat.

Sometimes people just stumble into the right

Weber, who in the late 1980s had unprecedented

what would be the trumpeter’s last year alive. 
Weber takes to Baker’s moniker as “the James

in-depth interviews (not just of Baker, but with his

Black Mountain
■ In the Future
JAGJAJAGJAGUWAR

S ee, the trick when paying homage to influenc-es of yesteryear — be it British Invasion, rock-abilly or, in Black Mountain’s case, a hybrid of 
heavy metal (Led Zeppelin/Black Sabbath) and 
prog rock (Emerson, Lake and Palmer) — is not 
just to try to sound like it but, in the most abstract 
sense, become the thunderous guitar chords, 
hammering drums, foreboding keyboard ambi-
ence, shrieking wails and mellow vocal shakes 
that seduce crowds and summon Beelzebub for 
another night of damnation. Labeled as indie 
rockers, Black Mountain probably doesn’t have 
satanic plots in mind, but as sophomore album 
In the Future kicks off with power driven “Stormy In the Future kicks off with power driven “Stormy In the Future
High,” you’re waiting for Ozzy to show up. When 
vocalists Stephen McBean and Amber Webber 
start harmonizing, you’ll think you were sucked 
into a dark basement in 1974, right before your 
then-teenage uncle had his “big epiphany.”

From then on, it’s a wild ride; bluesy rocker 
“Angel” swings through with the right amount of 
sultry guitar and synth accompanying McBean’s sultry guitar and synth accompanying McBean’s 

low-down, almost Tom Petty swagger, “Tyrants” 
pounds and subverts with epic awesomeness, 
and “Stay Free” sounds the most modern without 
sounding out of place.

If this finely crafted album falls anywhere, it’s 
with near-17-minute “Bright Lights,” an old-fash-
ioned stab at extended prog, with long minutes of 
empty organ and punctuations of guitar. Broken 
down, it might’ve worked, but we’re handed 
almost a sitcom’s length worth of indulgence. In 
fact, it’s really their only obstacle — the tunes 
work well, and perhaps a tighter production next 
time will yield something even more cataclys-
mic. Criticisms aside, Black Mountain’s cavernous 
speaker presence holds onto influences while 
carving an individual niche. Like their idols, they 
know that anything but music is blasphemy. It is 
in their blood, and they were born to jam.

Black Mountain will be performing at the 
Casbah, on Thursday, Feb. 7.

H ere’s to cheeky band names that play off of Microsoft Word fonts. Former SF cult-punks the Coachwhips once held the title of 
“most distorted rock band” in my mind, but now 
it’s beginning to look less clear with Times New 
Viking’s newest foray Rip It Off. The DIY trio Rip It Off. The DIY trio Rip It Off
tricks listeners who think they wouldn’t like noise 
music into slowly giving the genre a chance, serv-
ing as an adequate entry — the harsh tones still 
evoke some semblance of rock tradition. In short, 
the production quality matches an indie-pop 
radio station going out of range and fading into 
barely intelligible distortion.

“Teen Drama” kicks it off with sharp arpeg-
gios, super-easy keyboard riffs and a vocal duet 
that doesn’t even try for harmony. Minute-long 
blast “Drop-Out” splits vocal duties between 
singers Jared Phillips and Beth Murphy, the 
guitar mess jabbing the empty space with a 
vengeance. 

If you approach TNV from a straight-up indie 
viewpoint, you’ll be annoyed and disappointed viewpoint, you’ll be annoyed and disappointed 

with the blown-out fuzz coating on every instru-
ment in the mix; if you approach them as a noise 
enthusiast, you’ll be bored with their predictable 
4/4 arrangements and punk aesthetic. 

So the Viking find themselves in a crossbreed 
category, like their contemporary No Age, taking 
cues from the experimental and dousing its two-
minute sing-alongs in atonal style. Of course, you 
can’t tell what they’re singing most of the time, 
but that’s probably what the band wanted. Like 
My Bloody Valentine’s ethos, part of the beauty 
is letting your imagination piece together the 
lyrics. 

The other part is that TNV perfectly docu-
ments the thrill of playing music, giving you the 
drive to write similar songs with a weak practice 
amp and a few power chords. As an inspirational 
tool, they’ve totally succeeded with this record; as 
actual music, it’s not bad either.

YY ou might have never heard of it, but there’s a sleepy town by the name of Bruges making quite a name for itself on the streets of Belgium. The site of ancient cobblestone streets, canals 
and the most authentic medieval architecture north 
of Venice, Bruges is both the muse and backdrop for 
Martin McDonagh’s first feature film, the appropriately 
titled “In Bruges.” The film, inspired by an actual trip 
McDonagh took to Bruges (pronounced Broozh), is a 
darkly comedic caper about death, sightseeing, drugs 
and appreciating pretty buildings; it uses the Gothic 
environment to tell the tale of two hitmen hiding out in 
the cubbyhole city. 

Working from the city forward, McDonagh creates 
vivid protagonists: “While I was first there, about four 
years ago, I had diverging feelings about the place,” 
McDonagh said. “I started thinking of two characters 
who might respond to Bruges in distinct ways, and I 
started writing about them, with specific parts of Bruges 
for them to interact in and around.” These two characters 
became Ray and Ken, played by Irish actors Colin Farrell 

and Brendan Gleeson, who take to the city with some 
nefarious results.

Each assassin comes to Bruges with an entirely differ-
ent agenda. On one hand, who wouldn’t love museums 
chock full of culture and relics filled with Christ’s blood? 
Then again, how much culture can one person take before 
his brain taps out and the next pub crawl begins? This is 
where Ray and Ken diverge. Farrell’s Ray, alternately sav-
age and anguished, is tortured by the boredom of Bruges’ 
provincial pleasures. Meanwhile Gleeson’s Ken, a more 
experienced and affable killer, enjoys his time as a tour-
ist and attempts to share his love of history with his surly 
young friend. McDonagh tinkers with irony as Bruges 
brings out the best in both men, exposing them to some 
shady locals and even an American dwarf. Both become 
more human as the movie rolls along, despite their status 
as hitmen, each one reconsidering his role in life and the 
choices he’s made.

Bruges becomes surreal and beautiful — the perfect

backdrop for a crime caper drenched in dark 
comedy.

“It’s as if somebody built a magnificent 
movie set and said, go shoot,” McDonagh 
said.

But for every dreamy lakeside scenario, a 
scattering of “fuck yous” and gunshots smat-
ter the serenity. Of these, a majority are fired 
off by the film’s other critical character, Harry 
(the malevolently fun Ralph Fiennes), the 
English crime boss who has a major hard-on 
for Bruges and particular four-letter words. 
Fiennes is an arch villain straight out of a Guy 
Ritchie flick, with a sense of humor so dry it’s 
like huffing dust. 

But like all of McDonagh’s characters, 
Harry is driven by a multi-tiered system of 
ethics that is complicated and wicked. He’s a 

guy that will blow you away without a second 
glance, but at least he has his reasons, convo-
luted as they may be.

But the main show in “In Bruges” is the 
witty banter between the gun brawls. Farrell 
woos the audience as he mouths off in a cocky, 
Irish brogue, bashing Bruges at every turn 
with quips like, “If I’d grown up on a farm and 
was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I 
didn’t, so it doesn’t.” McDonagh, a playwright 
and filmmaker, puts his theater background to 
good use with apt dialogue that packs the film 
with line after line of quick-witted cheek. 

The combination of sauciness and Farrell’s 
long-lashed gaze can hardly make the audi-
ence hate Ray, even when he blinds a man 
with blanks. In the rough-and-tumble world 
of hired hits, McDonagh proves that even hit-
men need holidays.

A blonde, a gangster-pimp, ample violence and a shit load of gold. No, not a new 50 Cent video, but director Andy Tennant’s most 
recent silver-screen release, the equally bipolar 
“Fool’s Gold.”

The comedy-romance-action-adventure mess 
focuses on the lives of a married, soon to be 
divorced couple — Tess (Kate Hudson) and Finn 
(Matthew McConaughey). Fed up with Finn’s she-
nanigans, Tess opts to jump ship and chooses to 
follow a more practical path (teaching) rather than 
treasure hunting with her man-child hubby. But 
after the groundbreaking discovery of a rather 
sad-looking plate, Tess is convinced she’s found a 

trail to the jackpot, and decides to join her ex-hus-
band in the hunt for the loot. They team up with 
Hannah Montana look-alike Gemma Honeycutt 
(Alexis Dziena) and rich, ancient-by-comparison 
Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland) to form 
their expert gold-hunting team. Also hot on the 
path of the lost booty, pimp-daddy BiggBunny 
(Kevin Hart) and thug sidekicks Cordell (Malcolm 
Jamal-Warner armed with his best fake-Jamaican 
accent) and Curtis (Brian Hooks) attempt to out-
wit there Anglo-Saxon opponents. Chock one up 
for the race wars: it’s literally Team White versus 
Team Black.

Lenny Kravitz
■ It Is Time For A Love Revolution
VIRGIN

E verything about Lenny Kravitz makes you want to try to like his music. Is it an easy listening quality or generic genre blend? 
Psychedelic funk or rocked out rhythm-and-
blues? More than likely it’s his gorgeous face 
and body, along with that whole peace-lov-
ing-hippy thing he’s got going on. 

But what’s scarier than his eighth album 
title, It Is Time for a Love Revolution, is the 
fact that he’s been eye candy for not just you 
but probably for your mom as well. And that 
might be the problem with the album; it 
doesn’t really speak for any new incarnation 
of Kravitz. He’s got the classic rock funk and 
hokey lyrics down pat, that’s for sure, but 
what else?

With little nuggets of wisdom like “We’re 
gonna fly over the world inside our giant 
eagle/ We do just what we want and don’t care 
if it’s legal” on “Back in Vietnam,” it’s hard not 
to cringe at the gratuitously obvious political 
references and snooze-worthy guitar strums. 
The music hails back to ’60s and ’70s coun-
terculture, attempting to combine it with the 
high energy level of the early ’90s without the 
reinvention. On tracks like “Love Love Love” 
he recreates a Red Hot Chili Peppers’ mish-

mash of rap-rock that sounds exactly like 
“Give It Away Now” without the crisp charm 
of Anthony Kiedis.

The only time the going gets good is when 
Kravitz slows down with jazzy love serenades 
like “This Moment Is All There Is.” Sure the 
lyrics are corny, but the riffs are smooth and 
manipulated into such a sultry rock that you 
get steamed up just listening to it. What “This 
Moment” has is a genuine feeling of newness 
and heartfelt creation; it’s like suddenly find-
ing yourself inside a smoke-filled blues club 
in the 1970s. The thunder of his rock ballads 
pales in comparison to the authentic pull and 
orchestration on his softer tracks.

Upon repeat listens, Love Revolution comes 
together as an aging lovechild’s fist pump 
manifesto of mild intensity. He croons about 
love, whines about a dad who abandoned him 
and decries the U.S. government. Kravitz’s 
album is listenable, like an ambient noise 
machine set to ocean waves or sounds of the 
forest. It’s not difficult to like those noises 
— it’s just hard to remember them.

How to Lose Your Sanity in Two Hours

Zielman’s strives to deliver sympathetic laughter 
and more blows to the head in under two hours 
than “Star Wars” amputates limbs in all six install-
ments. Not to mention a more three-dimensional 
plot than their previous horror marvel.

Any verbal comedy translates the uncomfort-
able on-screen moments most people avoid even 
outside the theater. These comedic scenes are inex-
pertly fused with odd moments between father-
daughter pair Nigel and Gemma, whose asides 
produce the most cringes.

Beyond the forced characterization, the light-
hearted feel established earlier is undermined by 

the buckets of blood pouring out by the finale. 
The movie climaxes with a chaotic fight scene that 
abandons comedy all together, further emphasiz-
ing the notion that the writers wrote two scripts, 
put them together like pieces of two separate jigsaw 
puzzles and called it a movie. 

By now, we’ve seen enough topless action from 
McConaughey to form the next “Boys Gone Wild” 
video, enough blood to film “Saw V,” enough ditzy 
outbursts from Dziena to keep us from procreating 
anytime soon and, of course, enough indecision to 
keep us wary of gold-hunting themed action com-
edies for a very long time. At least until another 
“Pirates” movie comes out.

U pon first listen, the Evangelicals sound like some underground cult of theater-school dropouts, playing broken instru-
ments between laser-tag sessions. It’s fitting, 
then, that they’re a product of Norman, Okla. 
— the same strange prairie grounds famous 
for birthing weirdos like the Flaming Lips and 
horror-glam group Chainsaw Kittens. 

Their album, The Evening Descends, is a 
kitchen sink mash-up that bewilders before 
you realize that every pumping, pulsating bleep 
is in its perfect place. This realization takes 
place somewhere between the 18th and 19th 
repetition, so don’t feel too bad if the flamboy-
ant boys’ genius isn’t immediately apparent. 

Descends’ sequence of symphonics strings’ sequence of symphonics strings’
together clips of borrowed basement leftovers 
with operatic, dazing harmonies. It doesn’t 
matter what the words are — the electrifying 
tremors, cushioned by occasional, echoing air-
plane suctions are compelling enough to stand 
alone, if impossible to classify. 

Every genre-bending track plays like it once 
began with overlapping scribbles of disso-
nance, chiseled here and there to eventually 
forge a sighing psalm of restraint, grieving and 
operatic liberation (the kind you scream off the 
uppermost floor of a city building).

But then again, the words do matter for 
their unpredictability — some words are spo-
ken like the cracked PA announcements of an 

abandoned schoolyard, some are sung like the 
sacred musings of a divine chorus and others 
still are belted out in heartbreaking sincer-
ity. As the scales peel off into howling, you’re 
transported into the nightmarish conscience of 
an institutionalized schizophrenic who believes 
in voices. 

This fluctuation between reality and imagi-
nation is backed by an instrumental overload 
that’s more skill than overkill. On songs like 
“Party Crashing,” the arcade overloads and 
jingles don’t stifle delightfully lurid outpours, 
which pause only for a few lines of B-movie 
dialogue (“Son … you’ve been in an acci-
dent…/ What?/ They’ve severed your legs …”)

But masterpieces like “Bellawood” are what 
make the album unforgettable; the track is 
introduced by the sound of bone chewing 
and the tremble of violins, which gateway 
into African pattering and haunting twists of 
the electro-theramin — and before you can 
question it all, Josh Jones sobs, “Strange things 
keep happening!” and the commotion liquefies 
into the fairy glockenspiel of the next track, 
“Paperback Suicide.” In fact, all the songs seem 
to bleed into a single puddle of fantasy, until 
it’s evaporated into the evening (just in time for 
the next showing of Rocky Horror).

By Jenna Brogan
Staff Writer

M aybe we should call Vince Vaughn a philanthropist, dol-ing out fame to comic friends 
a few rungs down the success ladder. 
His new docu-comedy, “Wild West 
Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights 
— Hollywood to the Heartland,” 
hopes to be a journey to stardom for 
the “Wedding Crashers”’s up-and-
coming comedian pals, disguised as 
blue-collar stand up. But like the 
title and the endless, empty road 
that the tour bus navigates, the film 
drags on painfully. Sharing the bus 
with Vaughn for the solid month of 
shows in 2005 was midwestern fast-
food employee John Caparulo, danc-
ing Guido Bret Ernst, nondescript 
macho Sebastian Maniscalco and the 
token Arab, Ahmed Ahmed. 

Modeling the tour after Buffalo 
Bill’s travelling variety show, Vaughn’s 
goal, which he states within the first 
five minutes, is to demonstrate how 
the inspiration behind a standup 
comedian’s material stems directly 
from his or her own personal life 
and experiences. 

After the first hour you start to 
wonder how on earth the filmmakers 
will be able to stretch out the severe 
lack of substance into the full 100 
minutes. Then you quickly realize 
that they will indeed fail miserably, 
despite tossing in some geographical-
ly relevant rock songs like “Georgia” 
and “Streets of Bakersfield,” which 
only distract between the comedic 
segments. 

Surprisingly, the film’s meat can 
be found in the patriotic filler foot-
age of historical landmarks in all 30 
tour stops, combined with an in-

depth look at each of the comedians’ 
humble beginnings, rather than the 
performances themselves.

While backstage interviews about 
life in the unpredictable industry and 
ma-and-pa introductions attempt to 
tug at the heartstrings, “Wild West” 
can’t maintain a comfortable bal-
ance between the funny and serious 
— like the rocky transitions from 
toilet jokes to anxiety-induced, bor-
derline-suicidal comments. At one 
point, the film jumps from wise-
cracks about racial stereotyping to 
footage of the four comedians hand-
ing out free benefit show tickets 
to Hurricane Katrina evacuees in a 
trailer park. 

All good intentions aside, the 
sporadic shifts are awkwardly abrupt 
and possibly too heavy for the pur-
poses of the film. The few clips of the 
tour we do get to see, however, are 
dominated with cameos by Vaughn’s 
“Swingers” co-star John Favreau 
and Dwight Yoakam, among others, 
making it difficult to tell whether the 
four headliners actually have what it 
takes to make it to the big time, or if 
they are just a backdrop for already 
established talent.

The film’s irony lies in the fact 
that all 30 packed houses embraced 
the four comedians with open arms 
and wall-crumbling laughter, indi-
cating there was either a gigantic 
“applause” sign held off-screen, or 
the filmmakers did a poor job in 
selecting which bits to showcase in 
theaters. For director Ari Sendel, 
the amount of space between laughs 
is about equal to the space between 
this film and any paycheck, big break 
or Oscar.

the last singles match 6-3, 7-5.
The Tritons’ struggles continued 

in doubles as they dropped all three 
matches. UCSD’s top duo of Meister 
and Rubens lost a 9-7 decision. In num-
ber two doubles, Fatkhiev and Weber 
combined to beat Becker and Moallemi, 
8-5. In the third doubles match, Ronald 
Chow and Daniel Moore took down 
Alex Edstrom and his partner Negishi 
also by an 8-5 score.

“Injuries really hurt us, especially 
in our second match against Azusa,” 
Negishi said. “But we can’t let that be 
an excuse, and as we prepare for con-
ference play, it’s important that we get 
back to the level that our team knows 
we are capable of playing at.”

The Tritons took out the frustra-
tions from their Loss to Azusa Pacific 
when it faced Point Loma Nazarene 
on Feb. 6, crushing the Sea Lions  7-
2. Further results were not available 
as of press time. UCSD will look to 
carry its momentum into its home 
opener on Feb. 13 against Cal Poly 
Pomona, who the Tritons beat in 
three meetings last season.

FENCING — Participating in its 
first team meet in nearly a month, 
the UCSD fencing team performed 
very well in what should prove to be 
the most challenging competition of 
the year. After traveling to Atlanta 
for an open individual perfor-
mance meet at the North American 
Cup, the Tritons went to Chicago 
last weekend for the prestigious 
Northwestern Meet. Returning to 
the regular, team-focused style of 
competition was very much a wel-
comed aspect for UCSD, who saw its 
men’s team go 6-4 in dual matches 
while the women’s side posted a 7-5 
mark. 

In Chicago, the Tritons faced off 
against powerhouses such as Notre 
Dame, Ohio State, Northwestern 
and Temple University, all of whom 
are rated in the national top 10 in 
the United States Fencing Coaches 
Association poll. According to assis-
tant coach Josh Runyan, the oppor-
tunity to fence against such premier 
schools was great for the team.

“We went against some of the 
strongest teams in the country,” 
Runyan said. “The competition was 
made up of a large variety of schools, 
from D-I programs who have inter-
national recruiting programs down 

to D-III schools as well.”
One of the highlights from the 

weekend meet was the overall per-
formance of senior Chelsea Ambort, 
whose duals in women’s epee guar-
anteed her a spot in the NCAA 
Regionals and put her in a strong 
position to make an appearance 
at the National Championships in 
Columbus, Ohio in March. 

“I always feel like I could have 
done better but that’s only because I 
am a competitive person and never 
like to lose,” Ambort said. “However, 
some of my wins were against some 
of the best women in the nation and 
I am really proud of that. The wom-
en’s epee team this year is balanced, 
and by that I mean we each have 
certain different talents to bring to 
a meet that helps us win overall, it 
makes us a really strong squad.”

Acting as a humble veteran team 
leader, Ambort chose mostly to 
ignore her own personal accom-
plishments and focus on her team 
as a whole, as it posted a 9-3 over 
the weekend. Ambort looked to the 
versatility and talents of her team-
mates in explaining the team’s suc-
cess in Chicago. Senior Grace Bohn 
won a very impressive bout with 
Northwestern’s Kayley French, an 
internationally ranked fencer who 
placed 14th at Nationals in 2007. 
Junior Heather Stephenson won all 

three of her bouts against North 
Carolina to ensure the UCSD wom-
en’s victory. 

“I was also really proud of Grace 
Bohn who beat All-American 
Justyna Konczalska from Wayne 
State University,” Ambort said. 
“Grace was a walk-on who learned 
how to fence less than four years ago 
when we were freshmen, and now 
she can stand up against top fencers 
like Justyna; I think it is an amaz-
ing achievement. She couldn’t stop 
smiling after her victory and neither 
could we, it was awesome.”

On the men’s side, the epee team 
performed especially well, meriting 
the appropriate praise from sopho-
more Sean Blum.

“I think that my epee squad-
mates all performed very solidly,” 
Blum said. “We supported each 
other on the strip and we all earned 
pretty even results. As a squad, I 
think this was the best performance 
I have seen from us, considering the 
strength of the opposition.”

Next, the Tritons will travel to 
Fullerton, Calif. to do battle with Cal 
State Fullerton, Cal Tech University 
and UC Irvine, a repeat meet from 
when the four teams squared off in 
November.

Clutch Hitting, Solid Bullpen Lead to Win

keeping his team within reach.
Young lasted another 1 2/3 innings 

and didn’t allow any more runs before 
giving way to freshman Tim Shibuya, 
who was masterful in relief, saving the 
rest of the bullpen from work by turn-
ing in 4 1/3 innings of scoreless work 
in which he allowed only two hits and 
a walk and struck out six. 

“The two best things in life are 
good friends and a good bullpen and, 
well, this could be the first year in 
my tenure at UCSD where we have a 
chance to have a lights-out bullpen,” 
O’Brien said.

Shibuya’s gutsy performance kept 
the Wolves’ lead at only two runs until 
the seventh inning, when Saul sent a 
ball deep to left field to tie the game. 

Despite Saul’s heroics, it took some 
more clutch relief pitching and another 
timely hit to give the Tritons the vic-
tory and the series split. After the 
freshman pitchers did all they could 
do, O’Brien went to veterans in the late 
innings, first calling on senior right-
hander Keith Noe to stymie the Wolves 

in the eighth. Noe did just as his coach 
wanted, setting the Western Oregon 
hitters down in order and setting the 
stage for Imeson’s game-winning hit.

Junior third-baseman Justin Bono 
led off the bottom of the eighth inning 
with a single up the middle and 
advanced to second on a bunt single 
by sophomore shortstop Vance Albitz. 
Both runners advanced on a passed 
ball and with no outs the heart of the 
Triton lineup headed to the plate. 

Imeson was the first Triton to get 
a crack at driving in the go-ahead 
run, and he came through, singling to 
center field to send Bono home for a 
3-2 lead. Still with no outs and runners 
at first and third, the Tritons looked 
for some insurance runs but were put 
down and forced to head into the ninth 
clinging to a one-run lead.

New closer, senior Nick Rodieck, 
came in to earn the tough save and had 
no problem, setting the Wolves down 
in order, including a strikeout to open 
the inning. Rodieck has now earned 
saves in both of UCSD’s victories and 
looks comfortable so far in his new 

role as one of the team’s closers, along 
with Noe. 

According to O’Brien, the Tritons 
will need two closers available to get 
through a four-game series, especially 
when the games are close, as they were 
this past week.

“[Those] veterans in the bullpen 
we think are going to be able to fin-
ish games for us,” O’Brien said. “It’s a 
pretty good 1-2 punch and we think it’s 
going to be a successful combination 
throughout the year.”

UCSD also took on Cal State San 
Marcos in a nonleague game on Feb. 6 
and won 10-3 behind four home runs 
but further details were unavailable as 
of press time.

Next, the Tritons will take on 
Grand Canyon University Feb. 8 to 
10 and Barry University Feb. 15 to 17 
with both four-game series serving as 
tuneups before league play begins on 
Feb. 21, when they host Cal State San 
Bernardino in their CCAA opener.

Unlike in the previous two games, when UCSD lost by a total of three runs, the Tritons got clutch hitting throughout the lineup to pull off the 3-2 victory on Feb. 4.



THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  15

for a challenging weekend to say 
the least.

“We hadn’t beaten UC Santa 
Barbara since the 2005-06 season, 
and we had lost to two other teams 
in the tournament, UC Berkeley 
and UC Santa Cruz, in November,” 
senior offensive captain Maclyn Eick 
said. “We’d never beaten Stanford 
University in school history. We 
knew that we were probably the 
worst team as far as Frisbee skills 
are concerned and the best in con-
ditioning.”

According to Eick, the weath-
er was anything but pleasant, with 
severe wind gusts, heavy rain and 
fallen trees. Under these conditions, 
the Air Squids played their first 
contest of the tournament against 
Williams University, a team that the 
Air Squids were unfamiliar with 
coming into the tournament. Still, 
UCSD prevailed, winning by a score 
of 13-8.

The Air Squids’ second game was 
against Stanford, a team UCSD has 
never beaten in the history of its ulti-
mate Frisbee program. UCSD took 
care of business once again, relying 
on strong defense to pull out a 9-7 
victory over the Cardinal. 

UCSD’s next contest was against 
a UC Santa Cruz team that the Air 
Squids had lost to last November. 
The Air Squids fell in a 4-0 hole 
early but, once again, their defense 
stepped up and helped bring UCSD 
back to within one point. However, 
the early deficit was too difficult to 
overcome and UC Santa Cruz was 
able to hand the Tritons an 8-6 loss.

UCSD’s fourth and final game on 
Jan. 26 was against the Air Squids’ 
main rival: UC Santa Barbara. 
With all the recent games ending 
in UCSB’s favor, the Air Squids had 
a lot to prove in their first match 
against the Gauchos. UCSD relied 
on its endurance and conditioning 
to pull off an emotional 9-5 win.

“I’ve never beaten Santa Barbara, 
so it’s pretty exciting beating your 
rival,” sophomore offensive player 
Eric Abhold said.

Continuing the trend of playing 
against teams that the Air Squids 
have struggled with recently, UCSD 
faced UC Berkeley the next morn-
ing in even worse weather condi-
tions than the previous day. The Air 
Squids had also lost to UC Berkeley 
last November and were looking for 
redemption. UCSD’s defense once 
again stepped up in this game with 
sophomore defender Guy Hughes 
shutting down Cal’s deep offensive 
game and leading the team to a 13-
10 victory.

“Guy Hughes played really well 
for us,” Eick said. “He got scored on 
maybe once the whole tournament.”

With a win over Cal and an over-
all tournament record of 5-1, the Air 
Squids advanced to the finals to once 
again play the rival Gauchos. UCSD 
showed that its earlier win was no 
fluke as the Air Squids, backed by a 
strong defense, took an 11-8 victory 
and the tournament.

As if the tournament win wasn’t 
enough good news for the team, the 
Air Squids found out the following 
day that their strong showing had 
earned UCSD the No. 1 rank in the 
nation.

“We were really excited when 
we found out we were ranked No. 
1,” senior defensive captain Mark 
Johnston said. “We were more 
pumped up than we’ve been since 
I’ve been in the program. I’ve never 
seen this team so excited.”

The No. 1 ranking comes during 
a season in which the Air Squids, 
being a very young team, were sup-
posed to be looking to the future. 

“Coming into the season, the gen-
eral outlook was that it was definitely 
going to be a building year,” Abhold 
said. “We are extremely young, with 
our average age being under 20. 
After this tournament win, we’re not 

just looking at this as a building year 
anymore.”

Some of UCSD’s unexpected suc-
cess can be attributed to the new 
workout schedule that has the team 
hitting the gym and running the 
track much more than in previous 
years. The Air Squids have track 
practice every Monday to work on 
endurance and speed and gym work-
outs and Frisbee practices three days 
a week. 

“We got a coach this year specifi-
cally to help us work out,” Johnston 
said. “Our gym and track work has 
really paid off. We’re much faster 
and athletic than every other team 
we faced.”

The tournament win and the No. 
1 ranking not only reflect the extra 
work that UCSD has put in this 
season, but also given the Air Squids 
motivation to work harder and 
improve their game even further. 

“It reinforced everyone’s commit-
ment to get in the weight room and 
on the track,” Eick said. “We knew 
that we won the tournament because 
of our ability to run twice as long 
and twice as hard as the other team, 
not because of our Frisbee skills.”

The Air Squids will take their No. 
1 standing on the road with them this 
weekend to play in an 80-team tour-
nament in Las Vegas on Feb. 8 to 10, 
in which they are the sixth seed. In a 
city that thrives on flashing lights and 
jackpots, the Air Squids hope that 
their own flashy title of Best in the 
Nation will bring them success.

“The way the tournament is set 
up, we start out by playing some 
of the top teams in the tourna-
ment,” Abhold said. “If we do well 
on the first day, we can carry it on 
to the next day. Even if we don’t do 
extremely well, we will be exposed to 
a lot of different play styles which is 
important for a young team.”

CLUB SPORTS — After taking a 
win at its first tournament of the 
young season, the UCSD men’s ulti-
mate Frisbee team is ranked first 
place in the nation and is looking to 
continue its success. The Air Squids 
took first at a Santa Barbara tourna-
ment on Jan. 24 to 26 that was made 
smaller, featuring only the top six 
teams, because of bad weather con-
ditions.

UCSD was ranked five out of the 
six teams and, being unaccustomed

BASEBALL — After a disappointing 
1-2 start, the No. 15 UCSD baseball 
team salvaged a split in the four-game 
season-opening series with Western 
Oregon by completing a comeback 
victory, 3-2, over the Wolves in a Feb. 4 
make-up game.

When rain postponed the finale, 
the Tritons had just played three games, 
winning the opener on Feb. 1 by one 
run and losing both games in a double-
header on Feb. 2 by a total of three 
runs. It was fitting that the finale was 
another one-run game, as the Tritons 
tied the game in the seventh inning 
with a two-run homerun from redshirt 
freshman Kyle Saul and then took the 
lead in the eighth when junior second-
baseman Garrett Imeson drove in the 
game-winning run with a single.

“Considering how poorly we played 
all weekend, we were lucky to get out of 
there with a split,” head coach Dan 
O’Brien said. “But at the same time, 
we found a way to win a game that we 
had absolutely had to win on Monday...
against a team that has a pretty good 
chance to go to a Regional at the end 
of this year.”

The Tritons looked like they were 
in for another loss when the Wolves 
came out swinging to lead off the game. 
Freshman starting pitcher Nick Young 
ran into some trouble in the early 
goings, allowing two runs on three hits 
in the first inning. The young pitcher 
managed to escape without much more 
damage, leaving the bases loaded and KAREN LING/GUARDIAN

Men’s Tennis Starts 
Spring With Split

By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

MEN’S TENNIS — The UCSD men’s 
tennis team began its long-anticipated 
start to the spring season with mixed 
results, going 1-1 over the weekend 
in matches against UC Riverside, a 
Division-I school, and Azusa Pacific, 
one of the best teams in the National 
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
Coming off a school-best appearance 
in the Final Four last year, the Tritons 
have high hopes as the season begins.

The match at Riverside got 
UCSD’s season off to a rousing start, 
in an impressive 6-1 victory over the 
Division-I team. The Tritons took two 
of three doubles matches, then won 
five of six singles matches to walk away 
with a victory. Eric Rubens and Blake 
Meister, UCSD’s powerhouse number-
one doubles team, combined to beat the 
Highlanders top team of Joe Cartledge 
and John Park 8-3. Bijan Moallemi 
and Chad Becker helped secure the 
doubles point with an 8-6 win over 
Sebastian Ko and Gorjan Kovacevic. 
In the third doubles match, Kazumi 
Negishi and Alex Edstrom fell 8-5 to 
the UC Riverside team of Quac Doan 
and Ahmad Shiraz.

In singles play, it was more of the 
same as UCSD blew past overmatched 
UC Riverside in all but one match. 
Moallemi held the top singles spot with 
a 7-5, 6-4 win over Cartledge. At num-
ber two, Rubens made it a perfect day 
on the court with an impressive 6-4, 
6-2 victory over Park. The match of the 

day came at the number three spot as 
Negishi, a junior, prevailed in a tight 
6-4, 4-6, 5-5 match that was decided 
when Negishi’s opponent,  Kovacevic, 
had to retire during the match’s thrill-
ing conclusion. Meister had his own 
three-set encounter, and like Negishi, 
he was able to pull out the victory, win-
ning 6-2, 2-6, 6-1 over Doan at number 
four singles. Vince Nguyen was able to 
win his match at the sixth spot, a 6-4, 
6-4 win over Ko. UCSD’s only loss in 
singles against UC Riverside came at 
the five spot, with Jack Tadevosian tak-
ing out Chad Becker 6-3, 6-1 to earn 
the Highlanders’ only point.

As well as the Tritons season 
started, their fortune took a complete 
turnaround during Saturday’s matchup 
with Azusa Pacific. Winning only one 
match out of nine will certainly give 
the Tritons plenty of bulletin-board 
material as they try to get things going 
again.

Meister was the only Triton to walk 
away victorious, winning his singles 
match at the four spot, 6-2, 6-3 over 
Ronald Chow. Every other singles 
match was a victory for Azusa Pacific, 
with all coming in straight sets. At 
number one singles, Rubens was taken 
down by Matthijs Bolsius 7-5, 6-2. 
Patrick Kur defeated Moallemi at num-
ber two by a 6-1, 6-1 score. Then, at the 
three spot, Negishi was taken down by 
Mathias Weber 6-1, 6-4. Art Fatkhiev 
was able to beat Vincent Nguyen 7-5, 
6-2 at the fifth spot; Jan Friedrich won

SOFTBALL — The Tritons exploded 
out of the gates in their opening week-
end, posting a perfect 4-0 record at the 
Mizuno Best of the West Invitational 
in Turlock, Calif. The Tritons, who 
prior to the tournament were picked 
to finish third in the CCAA coaches 
poll, used the weekend games to estab-
lish their rightful place among softball’s 
elite and to set the tone for the rest of 
their season. UCSD faced off against an 
extremely competitive pool of teams, 
but cruised to an undefeated finish, 
outscoring its opponents 32-8. 

The final day of the tournament 
was rained out, forcing UCSD to forgo 
the final two games, which would have 
included the championship. Although 
the Tritons had gone 4-0, they fell victim 
to tournament rules and were awarded 
second place. Seattle University, which 
had also won four games, was given the 
championship because it had two shut-
outs while the Tritons only posted one.

Going into the opening tournament 
the Tritons knew they had a solid team, 
but made sure to keep their personal 
expectations reasonable.

“I can’t say we planned on coming 
out of the tournament undefeated, but it 
happened and that’s great,” junior first-
baseman Jenni Habib said. “Everyone 
came through in situations when we 
needed them to, and I think that’s 
what helped keep us on top. There was 
never a moment where we didn’t feel 
in control of the game. We came out 
strong and even when the other teams 
answered back with runs, we never lost 
confidence and got the runs back.”

The Tritons started their season 
off in style in the opening games, 
defeating Davis and Elkins 6-2 before 
upsetting No. 6 Humboldt State 5-2 
in the nightcap. As one of UCSD’s 
main rivals, the Lumberjacks’ defeat 
was especially impressive. In the game, 
senior third-baseman Jenny Maze hit 
her second homerun of the day, and 

27th of her career, with junior cen-
ter-fielder Allison May and freshman 
right-fielder Katrin Gabriel each turn-
ing in a multi-hit performance. The 
staff ace, senior Melissa Ward, allowed 
only one earned run on six hits for the 
complete game victory. 

After two relatively close games 
on Feb. 1, the Tritons breezed 
through  games on Feb. 2 against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal 
State Stanislaus. Junior pitcher Lauren 
Chastain paced UCSD with a six-hit 
complete game and drove in three 
RBIs at the plate. In the afternoon 
game, the Tritons faced host Cal State 
Stanislaus and made themselves feel at 
home, easily winning 9-0 against the 
10th-ranked team in the nation. Ward 
threw another gem, this time striking 
out four en route to a one-hit shutout. 
In the top of the first, senior second-
baseman Danielle Lukk connected for 
a grand slam, opening the floodgates 
for UCSD’s 11-hit, nine-run showing.

Speaking to UCSD’s second-place 
finish, Ward was diplomatic in express-
ing the sentiment of the team. 

“It’s a little disappointing to finish 
in second place after going 4-0; I would 
have really liked to have played Seattle 
for the title,” Ward said. “I’m sure we 
will run into them a few times this 
season though, so we’ll have to settle 
the score then.”

Head coach Patti Gerckens was 
proud of her team’s achievements, 
knowing that its veteran leadership 
will continue to produce quality wins 
throughout the season.

“It was a good weekend all around,” 
Gerckens said. “We saw all of the hard 
work that the team has been putting 
in really pay off. The mentality of the 
team this year is that we’re going to the 
postseason and that we’re going to do 
well; the expectations are high.”

Although the Tritons performed 
well up and down the lineup, two play-
ers were singled out for their play, with 
Maze being named the CCAA Player 
of the Week and Ward claiming CCAA 

Pitcher of the Week. Over the four 
games, Maze drove in six runs while 
clubbing two homeruns, one of which 
came against the 2007 West Region 
Pitcher of the Year, Humboldt State’s 
Lizzy Prescott. Ward went the distance 
in both of her wins while striking out 

10 and allowing just one run.
The Tritons will have their home 

opener Feb. 8, starting a four-game 
series against CCAA foe Chico State.
