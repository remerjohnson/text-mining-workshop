After 30 years of remaining rela-
tively untouched, the stagnant facade 
of La Jolla’s Westfield Shoppingtown 
UTC shopping complex has given its 
owners a reason to gear up for a mas-
sive architectural overhaul.

Westfield’s proposed $900-million 
facelift could potentially add 250 hous-
ing units amid its more than 150 new 
retail stores, along with dining and 
entertainment options. UTC is one 
of seven centers owned by Westfield 
Group, an Australian company that 
manages roughly 120 properties 
worldwide, 60 in the United States 
alone. The remodeled mall would 
bring 5,500 construction and design 
jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs to the 
city.

The Web site dedicated to the proj-
ect invites viewers to imagine “a fresh 
outdoor look reflecting the unique 
character of the San Diego lifestyle.”

Part of Westfield’s new proposal 
is providing a “sustainable design,” 
creating environmentally friendly and 
efficient buildings. The designers plan 
to attain a Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design certification 
from the U.S. Green Building Council 
— a non-profit coalition designed to 
promote construction that mitigates 
negative impacts on the environ-
ment — which has already named 
the project a LEED Neighborhood 
Development Pilot Project.

The new design would reduce 
freshwater consumption with the use 
of recycled water for land irrigation, 
and also include solar panels as a 

renewable energy source. An expand-
ed transit system would also push for 
a decreased reliance on automotive 
transportation.

According to Tim Daly, the city’s 
development project manager, a draft 
of the environmental impact report 
was open for public review in early 
August. However, members of the 
University City Planning Group said 
the report still leaves much to be 
desired.

The group issued a response to the 
report on Oct. 9, calling it vague and 
ambiguous among other criticisms.

“The whole problem with their 

plan is they have seven different ver-
sions of it,” UCPG Chairwoman Linda 
Colley said.

The various proposals for the land’s 
use range from a movie theater to a 
35-story high rise that may interfere 
with the airspace of the Marine Corps 
Air Station in Miramar. However, 
none of these proposals are discussed 
in depth within the report — a choice 
implying that the company could 
choose to change its building plans 
without community action, the UCPG 
response said.

UCSD Community Planner Milton 
Phegley said that the community is 

simply being cautious.
“The community’s experience 

has oftentimes been that promised 
improvements either lag behind the 
development which causes the prob-
lems or the improvements are never 
completed,” he said in an e-mail.

Issues with traffic congestion and 
noise in the area are also of paramount 
concern to the community group. 
Westfield’s proposed transportation 
system would include an expanded 
bus transit center, and the San Diego 
Association of Governments is pursu-

The UCSD School of Medicine and 
other medical schools across the coun-
try have begun expanding their class 
sizes to accommodate rising numbers 
of applicants and address the predicted 
shortage of medical professionals.

In response to a call from the 
Association of American Medical 
Colleges to expand enrollment by 30 
percent by 2015, the UCSD School of 
Medicine has increased its class size by 
10 percent this year alone.

Despite a two-year decline in the 
number of students applying to law 
schools, the competitiveness of newly 
admitted classes has either increased 
or remained constant during this 
time — a seeming paradox that may 
nonetheless offer hope to prospective 
law students.

A survey circulated to admissions 
officers at 190 national law schools 
by exam preparation service Kaplan 
Test Prep and Admissions found that 
about half of the queried schools 
reported a drop in applications over

In the wake of the largest fire-
related evacuation in state history, 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue praised the campus’ response to 
the disaster at an Oct. 31 town hall 
meeting, despite some criticism regard-
ing UCSD Medical Center’s decision to 
not pay employees who failed to work 
last week.

After acknowledging the 11 UCSD 
staff and faculty members who lost 
their homes to the fire, Rue directed the 
crowd’s attention to the accomplish-
ments of the campus’ crisis manage-
ment team and emphasized efficient 
communication between UCSD and 
the students and faculty, as well as 
UCSD and local authorities.

Fox praised the university’s emer-
gency notification system, which was 
assembled following April’s Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute and State 
University massacre to keep students

continuously informed with up-to-the-
minute information through personal 
text messages and voice mail. Though 
Fox was overseas on business when the 
fires first broke out, she said she still 
received notification from the system 
and returned to San Diego as quickly 
as possible.

In addition, the Academic Affairs 
Office, Business Affairs Office and 
Housing and Dining Services all 
worked together to keep the university 
functioning for those who remained on 
campus, Fox said. 

Rue also 
addressed the aca-
demic and personal 
issues that students 
may face due to 
the fires, especially 
after canceling the 
week of classes. She 
urged students to 
go to office hours, 
seek tutoring and 
use all available 
campus resources 
to their advantage 
to accommodate the missed week.

“It’s stressful to lose a week out of a 
10-week quarter,” Rue said. “It’s a sign 
of strength to ask for help.”

She added that emergency loans 
are available for those struggling finan-
cially, and those who could not get to 
work.

However, some attendees raised 
concerns about UCSD Medical Center 
employees, who — unlike their UCSD 
staff counterparts — were not paid 
if they were not working during that 
week.

Medical center CEO Richard 

Liekweg argued that the situations 
were different, because while UCSD 
was closed for all nonessential staff 
members, the medical center remained 
opened during the fires and its employ-
ees were expected to go to work.

Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven W. Relyea spoke about measures 
that UCSD took to protect the commu-
nity from similar large-scale disasters. 
He boasted not only of UCSD’s effi-
cient coordination with San Diego city 
officials, but also about the determina-
tion of those who stayed on campus to 

help.
“The only 

problem we 
had was telling 
someone to take 
a break,” Relyea 
said.

UCSD’s cam-
puswide emer-
gency drill, held 
a week before the 
fires, was present-
ed as evidence of 
thorough prepa-
ration.

“We had the same people in the 
same desks doing the same protocols 
last week,” he said.

Relyea echoed Fox’s sentiment, 
stressing the importance of the emer-
gency notification system that UCSD 
modified this past summer.  He admit-
ted that although there is no “silver 
bullet” for communication issues, hav-
ing a multi-pronged approach with text 
messages, voice messages and e-mails 
proved very successful.

ing the extension of the light-rail trol-
ley to connect University City to Old 
Town. Enhancing such forms of public 
transportation could encourage rider-
ship and decrease the traffic impact on 
the renovated shopping center. 

However, the proposal also 
includes a plan that would add more 
parking spaces, which would bring 
an estimated 18,000 car trips per day. 
With traffic already heavy on Genesee 
Avenue, and nearby freeway onramps 
to Interstate 805 and Interstate 5 pro-
viding additional congestion, some 
environmental groups say the propos-
al could strain city roads and threaten 
air quality. 

“This project would drive the 
need for widening Genesee Avenue 
and the Regents Road Bridge proj-
ect,” said environmentalist Debbie 
Knight, president of the Friends of 
Rose Canyon. “To me, this is not a 
green project.” 

Westfield representatives could not 
be reached for comment.

With public review closed as of 
Oct. 10, the company has been left to 
make changes and improve its pro-
posal. 

“The question is, can the commu-
nity legitimize their side to make them 
honor what the community wants?” 
Colley said. 

A date for a final EIR has not been 
determined, Daly said.

After the final draft is submit-
ted and final project issues are set, 
the city’s Planning Commission will 
hold a public hearing in front of City 
Council to approve the project. No 
date has been set for the hearing.

This week’s A.S. Council meet-ing was dominated by a guest appearance from Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox, who addressed the 
council in a way reminiscent of Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue’s recent visit.

Fox presented an overview of the 
progress that’s been made in improv-
ing the undergraduate experience — a 
laundry list that stretched from more 
on-campus hous-
ing to late-night 
bus routes and 
extended library 
hours. According 
to Fox, UCSD 
will have added 
more than 4,000 
beds by 2011, 
growth which she 
described as “the most aggressive in 
the nation.”

Fox explained her goal to eventu-
ally house 50 percent of the student 
population on campus. In her view, 
the philosophy takes into account the 
desires of community residents who 
both dislike the traffic congestion from 
student commuters as well as the con-
struction of new on-campus housing.

However, no discourse about stu-
dent housing would be complete with-
out raising the contentious issue of 
the proposed North Campus transfer 
housing and its impact on the nearby 
gliderport.

Associate Vice President of Local 
Affairs Aida Kuzucan, who’s been 
working with the La Jolla Town 
Council to ameliorate UCSD’s strained 
relationship with the community, com-
mented on the transfer housing at the 
Oct. 10 A.S. Council meeting, saying 
“We should not, not, not, not let this 
happen … We are not the only people 
living in La Jolla. We have to make 
compromises.”

Kuzucan raised the issue to Fox at 

last night’s meeting with some delicate 
phrasing, describing the controversy 
as creating “discomfort” in the La Jolla 
community. Fox brushed ambiguity 
aside and said, “Are you talking about 
the gliderport people?”

“People in the La Jolla community 
are getting behind them,” Kuzucan said. 
“[The] community feels like they’re 
being invaded.”

Fox seemed less than inclined to 
make changes to 
the plan because 
the future high-rise 
buildings will only 
impact fixed-wing 
gliders.

“I think we’ve 
done our best,” Fox 
said. “It’s a prudent 
use of state lands to 

house students at reasonable prices.”
All Campus Senator Meghan 

Clair, citing growing support in a 
Facebook.com group, asked Fox 
about the prospect of a UCSD football 
team. According to Clair, former Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson estimated that it would cost 
$1 million to start a football team.

The ever-nimble Fox had some her 
own statistics waiting at the wings, 
namely the $72-million and $100-
million Division-I football programs 
at Pennsylvania State University and 
Ohio State University, respectively.

“If you’re interested, keep the cards 
and letters coming, but for now we 
don’t have the money,” Fox said.

She also lauded the performance 
of UCSD’s emergency operations cen-
ter during last week’s wildfires and 
emphasized the multiple evacuation 
scenarios that the university was ready 
to execute.

“Or we could bring you all down 
to the beach,” she said. “It probably 
would have been the world’s biggest 
beach party.”

the last two years. Though the num-
bers of applicants have tended to rise 
and fall over the decades the survey 
has been conducted, in the past few 
years the national trend has taken an 
unprecedented downturn.

Steve Marietti, director of Kaplan’s 
pre-law program, said that 2006 saw 
a 4.8-percent decline in applicants. 
For the current year, the number has 
decreased drastically — a staggering 
17.4 percent. 

Since the 1950s, many other options 
have opened for students who instead 
pursue graduate degrees or join the 
work force. The number of students 
pursuing medical, biological or engi-
neering careers has also risen, which 
may contribute to the dwindling num-
bers of law school applicants. 

“The strength of the economy, 
including the availability of jobs, has 
a significant effect in what students 
choose to pursue in their post-under-

grad years,” Marietti said.
Despite the drop in applicants, 

most law schools say that their classes 
are as academically qualified as ever.

Marietti said the reason for the 
high-quality applicant pool in spite 
of the decline in interest is due to the 
fact that qualified students continue 
to apply.

“Others may be discouraged to 
apply because of the competitive 
nature of the application process, 
therefore raising the averages of 
enrolling classes,” he said.

Marietti reported that while 50 per-
cent of admissions offices agreed that 
they were receiving fewer applications, 
79 percent said that their admitted 
classes were not becoming any less 
competitive. 

Contrary to the shrinking applicant 
figures, the number of students actually 
enrolling in law school is on a slow rise. 
According to data from the American 
Bar Association Legal Education 

and Admissions branch released in 
February, the number enrolled has 
risen 0.3 percent, by approximately 
over 800 students.

Although nationally it seems that 
the applicant pool is decreasing, some 
schools have reported climbs in their 
choice of applicants. According to 
Robert Schwartz, assistant dean of 
admissions at the UCLA School of 
Law, numbers increased from 5,834 
to 6,499.

Marietti warned that the current 
statistics should be taken with a grain 
of salt.

“The events we see in place here 
are really relative to the current time 
period,” he said. “These statistics will 
have their ups and downs, just like any 
other sort of statistical graph. What 
this means, though, is that students 
need to take advantage of the stats.”

UCSD School of Medicine, said that 
this year’s class consists of 134 students, 
compared to a past class size of 122. 

In expanding numbers, UCSD 
joined the growing ranks of medical 
schools trying to meet the AAMC’s 
goal. Some schools, such as Michigan 
State University’s College of Human 
Medicine and the University of 
Arizona’s College of Medicine, are even 
adding additional campuses.

However, enrollment has not kept 
up the pace with rising application 
rates. Kelly said UCSD’s School of 
Medicine has witnessed about a 5-per-
cent increase in the number of appli-
cations every year for the past five 
years. This jump in applicants allows 
the school to be more selective and 
increase the academic quality of appli-
cants, she said. 

Nationwide trends mirror those at 
UCSD, with an 8.2-percent increase in 
applications over the past year, com-
pared to only a 2.3-percent rise in 
acceptance rates. 

Medical school admission is becom-
ing more competitive largely due to the 
higher number of applicants. In addi-
tion, this year’s applicant pool was more 
qualified than ever before.

According to the AAMC, appli-
cants for the 2007-08 school year had 
the highest average Medical College 

Admissions Test scores and under-
graduate GPAs on record. Each year, 
students applying to medical school 
also have more experience in pre-medi-
cal activities. 

AAMC officials say that there is no 
obvious reason for the dramatic jump 
in applications, but there are several 
potential causes. The group has been 
pursuing efforts to promote medical 
school, especially to underrepresent-
ed portions of the population. These 
efforts seem to have been at least par-
tially successful, with AAMC report-
ing that black and Latino males both 
applied at rates that were almost 10 
percent higher this year.

While some students join service 
groups and study furiously for the 
MCAT, others find that the hysteria 
about medical school applications may 
be blown out of proportion.

“Some people may find the task 
of applying to medical school diffi-
cult, with the separate applications, 
secondary [supplementary applica-
tions] and interviews,” said Ben Hu, a 
first-year student at the UCSD School 
of Medicine. “But if you’re the type 
who’s prepared and on top of things, it’s 
only marginally worse than the college 
application process.”

The numbers indicate that medical 
school still holds a considerable allure 
for many UCSD students. Kelly said 

that the increase may reflect an rise in 
population size for students in their 20s 
— which therefore leads to an increase 
in the size of the pre-med section of 
that population — and the uncertain 
economy, which can make medicine 
seem a stable and lucrative alternative.

“Ideally, everyone wants to pursue 
medicine to help people,” said Revelle 
College senior Siu-Ling Sit, president of 
the UCSD Pre-Medical Association of 
Students for Service. “Of course, it does 
pay a tremendous amount of money, 
easily six figures, and it’s probably the 
one job that every parent wants their 
child to pursue.”

John Muir College sophomore 
Chelsea Kolander, a second-year 
intern at the Student Services Center, 
decided to pursue a career in medi-
cine after developing ovarian cysts 
at age 14, and started learning about 
women’s issues.

Despite the intense competition, 
many students still say they are opti-
mistic about their future in medi-
cine.

“I’m definitely going to apply [to 
medical school],” Kolander said. “I defi-
nitely want to get in right after college 
but if I don’t get in, I will apply again 
the next year.”

About two weeks ago Stephen Colbert announced his plans to run in the 2008 presidential election. Television-
less, I didn’t find out until the next day, when 
Facebook told me many of my friends had 
already joined the site’s “1,000,000 Strong For 
Stephen T. Colbert” group, and that I too had 
been invited to join. 

I left the invitation unanswered and went 
on with my week; the fires struck, school was 
closed and I soon forgot Colbert completely 
— until today.  

Thanks to Facebook’s stalker-level “news 
feed,” I was notified that two particular friends 

recently joined the group. Now usually I glaze 
right over notices like this, preferring to check 
out recently posted photos or events (don’t 
judge, you do it too!), but this one actually  
caught my attention.

I met the first friend in high school. She 
attends community college near our home-
town and when she introduces herself to 
people she tells them three things: her name, 
that she’s Christian and that she’s pro-life. 
Obviously it’s no surprise that she identifies 
her political views as “very conservative.”

The second friend I met in college. She has 
since graduated and is now in the process of 
joining the Peace Corps. She likes good music, 
getting krunk and doesn’t believe in God. This 
friend identifies her political leanings as “very 
liberal.”

Though both girls are nice, they aren’t 
exactly on the same political team. 

But party loyalties don’t matter to Colbert, 
who said he’s running both as a democrat and 
a republican. So despite severe ideological 
differences, both friends have thrown their 
support his way.

 Just 14 days after he entered the race, 
Colbert’s Facebook support has mushroomed 
to an astounding 1.3 million young people, 
over 4,000 of whom registered to vote after 
hearing of his campaign. 

You’ve got to hand it to Colbert: Certainly 
no candidate in my lifetime has been able 
to capture what political analysts call “the 
youth vote” so well. The “Hillary Clinton 
for President — One Million STRONG” has, 
despite its name, only just over 8,000 mem-
bers. The “Barack Obama (One Million Strong 
for Barack)” group is doing a little better with 
nearly 400,000 members. The “Mitt Romney 
(One Million Strong For Mitt)” has about 
15,000 members. And poor Rudy Guiliani 
has only been able to woo 113 young people 
to his “million strong” group. Keep in mind 
these candidates have been campaigning for 
months.

While Colbert’s campaign isn’t likely to 
actually threaten them, these out-of-touch 
politicians deserve the scare they should be 
feeling. Campy as the sentiment is, we college 
students are the key voting demographic of 
the future. And it certainly wouldn’t hurt to 
give us some attention.

It’s a vicious cycle: Young people can’t con-
nect with detached rhetoric-filled politicians, 
making it hard for them to get excited about 
voting. 

Politicians see that the youth vote is very 
small and don’t take the demographic seri-
ously. So they continue to think they’re safe 
ignoring college students, and college students 
become even further disinterested in the dem-
ocratic process — choosing to focus attention 
on celebrity gossip instead of life-changing 
governmental decisions. 

(Like the Patriot Act, republican Supreme 
Court appointments or jumping into an unjust 
and unprovoked war backed only by scare tac-

With lingering concern regarding the integrity of the campus’ current course withdrawal policy, mem-
bers of the Academic Senate’s Committee on 
Educational Policy have begun to take a closer 
look at what some faculty have deemed a bro-
ken system. 

Although the senate has yet to introduce 
an official proposal on “W” policy changes, 
senate members are discussing procedures to 
restrict abuse and overuse of the system. 

One consideration would implement a 
petition process modeled after UC Berkeley 
and UC Irvine, under which students are 
required to explain their reason for requesting 
withdrawal. 

This suggestion, however, would dramati-
cally increase bureaucracy and paperwork, 
resulting in higher costs for the administra-
tion and reduced accessibility for students 
who value the system’s flexibility. 

While the CEP’s decision to continue 
researching UCSD “W” patterns and frequen-
cies is promising, variables affecting trends 
like drop deadlines and academic terms are 
innumerable and as such, the senate should 
tread lightly when considering any policy 
modifications. 

For example, when comparing UCSD’s 
withdrawal patterns to those of UC Berkeley, 
the senate should account for differences 
between the semester and quarter systems, 
which offer varying degrees of leniency for 
students. 

The drop deadline itself may also con-
tribute to increased withdrawal levels. While 
administrators typically set the drop deadline 
during fourth week, many students don’t have 
midterms until fifth or sixth week and there-
fore cannot foresee possible problems that 

might force them to drop a course. 
Furthermore, without knowing their mid-

term grades, students struggle to judge their 
class standing. This hinders their ability to 
determine if classes match their skills or 
course and extracurricular activity load. 

As administrators consider alterations, 
they must keep these factors, as well as the 
host of others affecting UCSD’s course with-
drawal levels, in mind. 

Given that officials acknowledge the need 

for more insight before an actual decision is 
made, it is perplexing that they nixed CEP 
Chair Kim Griest’s suggestion to form a sub-
committee that would focus on evaluating the 
need for policy updates. Instead, they opted 
to have all CEP members collaborate on an 
effort that will likely be much more difficult 
to coordinate. 

But before members break ground on any 
research, this board has one request — that 
they take a long, hard look at why they feel the 
need to meddle with student affairs. 

Their lofty goal of reducing wasted class-

room space caused by unnecessary with-
drawals underscores a longstanding injustice. 
While students increasingly foot the bill for 
their education, administrators still unfairly 
bereave them of their ability to control how 
their money is spent. 

If it’s student fees that pay for classroom 
space, shouldn’t students be able to use the 
system as they choose without administra-
tive interference? (Assuming they are, in fact, 
abusing it at all.)

Recognitition of inequality by administra-
tors, however, is unlikely, so until students 
regain control over their own education they 
will be left waiting while the Academic Senate 
takes the reigns. Students’ only choice is to hope 
administrators realize something they already 
know — the system is far from broken.

Grove in Desperate Need of Council Oversight
College-Age 

Voters Thirsty 
for Candidate 

With Personality

See SHOES, page 5

What ever happened to the Grove Caffe? After years of neglect, the A.S. Council hired a nonstudent 
manager to handle the cafe’s staggering debt 
and whip the cafe into shape. It’s a sad but 
common story: Frazzled parents throw up 
their hands and farm care-taking responsibili-
ties out to someone more “qualified.”

But in reality, the council abandoned its 
quirky coffee-enterprise child long ago. This 
debt is only symptomatic of chronic com-
munication and oversight failures — prob-
lems that cannot be solved by simply adding 
another step in the bureaucratic ladder, espe-
cially because the Grove’s employees have so 
adamantly advocated student-only leadership. 
After all, the council’s “out of sight, out of 
mind” attitude is what first pushed the cafe 
into debt, when the council’s enterprise office 
left its student employees to run a business 
without any true financial capabilities.

No one can do the enterprise office’s job 
for it, and inserting a nebulous advisory com-
mittee or a manager who doesn’t even report 
to the council will only increase the discon-
nect. 

But blame shouldn’t fall completely on 
councilmembers. The Grove’s own employees 
failed to define their needs as they witnessed 
their beloved cafe’s appalling decline first-
hand. Rather, the council’s long absence from 
the issue has fostered a false sense of impor-
tance in student managers, whose pride now 
makes them uncooperative.

Just as the council needs to take responsi-
bility for its dying enterprise, student employ-
ees need to set aside their arrogance if they 
really want to save the cafe they’re fighting so 
hard to control. 

Frankly, employees had their chance to 
handle the situation, but instead allowed the 
Grove’s financial woes to go unchecked. If 
anything, employees should thank the council 
for finally giving them some attention and 
embrace the new manager with open arms.

So while the cafe remains closed, the coun-
cil shirks its fundamental duties and the 
employees pout over the incoming manager, 
the Grove’s problems remain, and its future 
looks painfully bleak. If those involved really 
want to solve the debt, their first step should 
not be to add more independent figureheads, 
but to unite the council with its enterprise via 
open and clear communication.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

tics, to name a few.)
OK, so Colbert has the support 

of college students, or at least more 
than any other major candidate. The 
question now is: What will he do 
with this support? He’s famous for 
being satirical, and is a master at 
staying in character — that’s why 
people love him. 

He’s brilliant and hilarious, and 
while his gag crusade for president 
is sure to be equally so, perhaps 
this time the joke has gone a little 
too far.

I’m not convinced Colbert’s sup-
porters are in on the joke. Rightfully 
starved for a contender they can 
connect with, his followers see 

Colbert as the light at the end of a 
vapid candidate tunnel and genu-
inely want to see him win. (Hell, 

part of me feels the same way.) 
But in a country desperately in 

need of strong new leadership, he 
has the potential to be a danger-

ous wrench in the democratic gears. 
What happens when millions of 
young people waste their votes on 
a comedic version of Ralph Nader, 
splitting the vote and dooming 
the United States to another four 
years of corruption, environmental 
destruction and constitutional dis-
mantlement?

Though the tremendous support 
Colbert has gained is awesomely 
scary, I guess I might be overreact-
ing. It has only been two weeks, 
and election day is still over a year 
away. 

And while I hope we see this 
joke-campaign’s punch line soon, 
all we can do at this point is sit back 
and let the hilarity ensue.

Article Paints Innacurate 
Picture of Former VC

Dear Editor,
Thank you for the opportunity 

to correct the mischaracterization 
of my position regarding the mis-
sion and program priorities of the 
Office of Academic Support and 
Instructional Services that appeared 
in your Oct. 22 article, “O.A.S.I.S. 
Survives Funding Drought.”

Contrary to the article, I never 
“lost interest in serving a broad 
degree of new freshmen who would 
benefit from services that facilitate 
their transition to UCSD.” In fact, 
I strongly advocated that O.A.S.I.S. 
should focus its academic support 
services on three target populations 
and have objective criteria for evalu-
ating how effectively it was serving 
each population:

1. All new undergraduates 
— both freshmen and junior-level 
transfer students.

2. All new students with “predict-
ed low first year grade point averag-
es” who have a higher relative prob-
ability of not making Satisfactory 
Academic Progress during their first 
quarters at UCSD.

3. First-year students on aca-
demic probation or subject to dis-
missal status.

The above set of priorities 
serves all undergraduates and, most 
importantly, directs extra attention 
and services on a priority basis to 
those students with the greatest aca-
demic support needs. The effective-
ness of such an approach is in part 
demonstrated by the initial success 
of the Student Affairs interdepart-
mental Goals In Action Program 
in assisting students with academic 
difficulty to improve their academic 
performance and return to satisfac-
tory academic status.

Former Vice Chancellor of

GANGSTER S
PARADISE

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writerr

T
he American audience has loved characters like 
Frank Lucas many times over: He is a man of 
principle and precision, anchored by his family 
but driven by his business. Hollywood’s crime-

centric personas are most successful when softened to 
a likable level, where murder is somewhat justifiable 
— and a hell of a lot more cinematic.

The real Frank Lucas? This smalltime Harlemite killed 
his way to the top of the 1960s heroin trade as an innova-
tive businessman, got caught, then dimed out dirty cops 

and criminals to cut his own cell time from 70 years to 
four  — hardly the gallant man Denzel Washington plays 
with velvety guile in “American Gangster,” Ridley Scott’s 
newest jaunt into violence and crime.

“Gangster” is based on a New York Magazine piece 
about Lucas’ rise to power. His transformation from article 
to film — from a starkly gripping page-turner to a murder-
ous urban deity on the silver screen — tells volumes. The 
writing, directing and acting are so crisp and honest that 
the film bestows an alluring flavor upon its every set, from 
crack dens to mansions, from South Asian titty bars to 

Jay-Z
■ American Gangster
ROCK-A-FELLA

T he newest album from Jay-Z, easily the most iconic MC of his day, was magically conceptual-
ized after a sneak-preview screen-
ing of Ridley Scott’s “American 
Gangster.” It has been hailed as one 
of Jay’s best albums, a return to the 
formula that made his first album, 
Reasonable Doubt, a hip-hop classic. 
In fact, his moody concept album is 
almost being toted as Jesus Christ’s 
return.

But this isn’t really a concept 
album — especially when you con-
sider the Jigga man has been rap-
ping about most of its lyrical themes 
since 1996. Instead, this is Jay-Z 
doing what he does best: talking sick 
about moving coke, reflecting on his 
illustrious past and throwing around 

a lot of shit.
Still, the fact that Jay might be 

rehashing tired topics doesn’t sub-
tract from the expertise in execu-
tion. “Fallin,” the album’s climax, 
touches on the same remorse and 
addiction he addressed back in ’96: 
“The irony of selling drugs is sorta 
like you’re using it/ Guess there’s two 
sides to substance abusing.” Still, the 
song is a rare Gangster gem, thanks 
in great part to a haunting beat from 
Jermaine Dupri and equally haunt-
ing hook by Balil.

Not every attempt at revisited 
introspection is as successful. While 
“Pray” and “American Dreaming” 
aren’t necessarily sore thumbs, they 
give little to rave about. Hova’s effort-
less flow often backfires, so smooth 

that its words are easily tuned out. 
For the same reason, the album’s lush 
backdrop doesn’t strike any particu-
lar chords of its own; “Pray” is overly 
dramatic, with hectic strings that 
fade in and out of its simple drum-
beat and spoken-word pieces by 
Beyoncé between verses that create 
a corny mess. “American Dreaming” 
is the equally unexciting counterpart 
to “Pray,” except in this case, the 
drama-attempting instrumentation 
feels underproduced.

Thankfully, Hova’s latest is no 
Kingdom Come, so for every misstep 
— like the drum-machine grinder 
“Hello Brooklyn” — there’s more 
than enough padding to make up

ccording to Steven 
Schick — new 
artistic director 

and conductor for the com-
munity- and student-built 
La Jolla Symphony — just 
about anyone with a musi-
cal sensibility can do the 
things he does before 
the orchestra, back to 
the audience, stenciling 
out swells of sound in 
the open air above the 
conductor’s stand.

“I could teach you to be 
a conductor in ten min-
utes,” he said Monday, 
amid the peaceful 
collection of percus-
sion instruments that 
consume his Warren 
Lecture Hall office. “Not 
even. I could teach you the motion 
in three minutes. I think if you lis-
ten and try to make things better, you 
can be good — even if you’ve never 
conducted before.”

Schick defines a conductor’s 
responsibility as “communication by 
gesture” — a kind of sign language for 
the sonically gifted, if you will — and 
most surely underestimates his rare 
and individual gift for the art of con-
ducting. Rehearsing in Mandeville

THE BEST SONGS

THIS WEEK

Senior Staff Writer

I n the movie biz, everything comes in twos. Last week’s delusion was a man in love with a sex doll, in 
“Lars and the Real Girl” — a film that 
glided through awkward moments 
and tragic humor with the unimped-
ed grace of a ghost through walls.

But this week, we get “Martian 
Child,” a miserably sappy melodrama 
as pointed as a vampire without a 
dental plan. It’s essentially “K-Pax” 
meets “Powder,” minus Kevin Spacey’s 
talent and the original premise of the 

latter: In “Martian,” science-fiction 
writer David Gordon (John Cusack) 
decides to recover from his wife’s 
death by adopting a child convinced 
he’s on a mission from Mars.

Dennis (Bobby Coleman), the odd-
ball orphan, is horribly pale — he 
spends most of his time in a refrig-
erator box — and wears a weighted 

scuba belt to keep from float-

The Polyphonic Spree

THE BELLY-UP TAVERN/ NOV. 1 / 9 P.M. / $22

There’s little you can do to avoid the awe-inspiring stage presence of 
the Polyphonic Spree, Tim DeLaughter’s rock-orchestra brainchild marrying 
a 30-odd ensemble (in multi-colored robes) with hard-driving yet heavily 
melodic tunes. It’s pure emotion channeled via the wall of sound rivaling 
Phil Spector’s past productions, lyrically drifting somewhere between 
spiritual homilies and empowered individualism, all with a glad-to-be-alive 
enthusiasm that occasionally delves into dark introspection and fanfares of 
epiphany. The Polyphonic Spree will be performing along with Rooney and 
the Redwalls. (CM)

Yellow tango. Yola tangle. Yo, let’s tango. Well, you know. 
These folksy indie exotics from Hoboken, New York (new Brooklyn, 
anyone?) debuted in 1986 and, well, haven’t really evolved much 
over the past two decades. But that’s okay — they were years of 
their contemporaries when it came to stringing sad-yet-sardonic 
lyrics from unforgettable acoustic openings. Their appeal is in 
artistry rather than accessibility, arranging instrumentals into 
discordant compositions reminiscent of Blonde Redhead’s. Unlike 
similarly categorized bands like the Postal Service, whose songs 
derive from soulless drum machines and repetitive tune-loops 
— or the Killers, whose lyrical mediocrity leaves little to the 
imagination — Yo La Tengo’s slow-paced, do-it-yourself aesthetic 

belies layers of complex melody.
With a dedicated fan base that somehow manages to outpace 

the pop radar and 11 solid albums under their belts (each with a 
title cheekier than the last), Yo La Tengo has their cake and eats it 
too — soliciting applause from the industry and populace, without 
ever compromising their stubborn racket. (JG)

COURTESY OF MATADOR

Hiatus Editor

I t’s impossible to say whether Ian Curtis — the young, tragic 
voice of Joy Division, 
born of post-punk’s first 
rumblings and gone 
with the close of the 
technicolored ’70s — would have progressed and 
achieved enough in later in life, had he not hung 
himself from the kitchen ceiling, to warrant the 
now-insatiable fascination with the potential 
that shrines his long-dead enigma.

So, though no fan-in-hindsight can help 
but wring the details of Curtis’ short 
life and sudden death for answers, we 
must keep in mind that every nuance in 
his tortured artistry would hold far less 
weight if not for the shadow of its looming 
end. We must consider the possibility that 
his miniature legacy — two haunting albums 
and a handful of shakily videotaped, volatile 
performances — was all he had in him, 
all he was meant to deliver our mortal 
world.

“When I’m up there singing, 
they don’t understand how 
much I give,” narrates Curtis, 

portrayed in “Control” by Sam Riley, during a tour-induced 
breakdown. “How it affects me. I never meant for it to 

grow like this. I’ve no control anymore.”
A recent explosion of interest in the legend of Joy 

Division (especially its suicidal centerpiece) has scat-
tered many an ode to better remember them by: a re-
remastered box set, a prying documentary and now the 

black-and-white biopic known simply as “Control,” 
directed by longtime photog-to-the-rock-stars 

Anton Corbijn and starring spitting-image 
newcomer Sam Riley. But that certain 

haziness in the band’s graspability — 
the mystery that has always pulled 

us closer — seems only to deepen 
with every resurrection’s attempt 

at pinpointing the strength of 
Joy Division’s emotional grip.

It’s not surprising, then, 
that the only criticism this

Ween
■ La Cucaracha
SCHNITZEL

W een are completely insane. As if to prove this, La Cucaracha sounds like Michael Stipe, Boz Scaggs, 
Steven Tyler, Bob Marley, Donovan, New 
Wave, Toby Keith and three hillbillies, all 
fighting to the death over a methadone 
syringe while Dean and Gene Ween shout 
encouragement, masturbate and then 
hold a little pity party.

The album’s only standout is “Learnin’ to 
Love,” a foot-stomping acid-country anthem 
that finds Ween at their best, cruelly decon-
structing every genre they come across, then 
transforming the detritus into an impeccable 
homage and/or sadistic joke. Unfortunately, 
the remainder of Cucaracha is neither mali-
cious nor immaculate. “Friends” is a mid-
dling disco loop — watered down from its 
synthed-out Eurohouse iteration on this 

summer’s Friends EP — and “The Fruit 
Man” is a plodding reggae burner, perhaps 
successful only in its imitation of the shal-
low drudgery churned out by the Marley 
pedigree (read: Ziggy to Damian).  

Ween’s last tour was canceled due to “an 
immediate intervention for the health, wel-
fare and safety of one of its members,” and 
three years later, the addiction still shows — 
Cucaracha smacks of rehab, all dull intro-
spection and slow soberiety, burnt-out and 
bland. Gag-rockers Dean and Gene have 
lost themselves in a convoluted post-mod-
ern maze of parody and technical earnest-
ness; in other words, Ween have become 
the punchline to their own existence.

Band of Horses
■ Cease to Begin
SUB POP

T hroughout their tightly packaged follow-up to 2006’s half-hearted flyaway Everything All the Time, Band of Horses never once break an almost 
intimidatingly naive stargaze, sharpened by a rolling 
indie-pop standard to set even the most closeted 
Brokeback Mountaineer swooning. Each of the 10 
tracks are sold dead-hard to the last breath and lin-
gering minor, an advertising campaign — certainly in 
the best interest of timid pussyrockers the plains over 
— for the magic in keeping a straight face.

No matter how impossibly innocent (“When I 
lived alone/ Is there a ghost in my house?”) or hilari-
ously mushy (“Watch how you treat every living soul”) 
this Southeastern sextet reveals itself to be, snide judg-
ments are much more difficult to aim when up against 
vocalist Ben Bridwell’s droopy puppy-dog eyes, so 
full-mooned that they flash with an unmistakable 
reflection of all our own hidden sappy parts. And 
the longer we’ve stayed quiet, the bigger challenge it 

becomes to hurt his feelings — this strained voice that 
so loves to be sweet, this vulnerable small town cousin 
to happy-sad heroes like the Shins, the Flaming Lips 
and My Morning Jacket — almost like he’d know if 
we said something bad about him; or worse, like we’d 
really be poking fun at our own soft spots.

This year, Horses shrug their shoulders of distor-
tional pretensions for a jangly parade of unabashed emo-
pop, nerdier in all its folky, lovedrunk simplicity but all 
the more relatable for it. “The world is such a wonderful 
place!” Bridwell calls into the “Garden State” canyon, 
without even the faintest trace of sarcasm or self-mock-
ery. It’s an endearing shell he’s been hiding under — one 
we only wish we had the guts to wear in public.

Band of Horses perform live Nov. 26 at the Glass

for it. “Roc Boys,” with its triumphant, celebratory 
horns, perfectly captures all the glam excess that 
reputedly accompanies the success of drug deal-
ing. Jay’s swagger on the track is ridiculous, as he 
spits such dope braggadocio as “Heroin has less 
steps than Britney/ That means it ain’t stepped on, 
dig me?” Black superhero music, indeed.

Overall, Jay shines brightest when he’s in 
celebration’s liveliest throes, and his beats — 
from bigtimers like Diddy, Just Blaze and the 

Neptunes — follow suit. “Party Life” is the 
epitome of late-night smooth, combining a silky 
guitar riff with equally sultry backup vocals, and 
Jay attacks the track like it’s a new-and-improved 
rendition of “Change Clothes.”

Given the nature of the film “American 
Gangster,” Jay isn’t given much room to neglect 
his roots — so along with hints of his new 
kicked-back maturity, the old-timer makes sure 
to include some crap for old-school hip-hoppers. 
“Ignorant Shit” and “Success” will have even the 
most bitter ex-fans bobbing their heads in nos-
talgia, the latter track a paramount lyrical slug-
fest with nemesis-turned-ally Nas. The pair wax 
poetic, lamenting that success and wealth has got 
them jaded. The concept is as well-delivered as it 
is clever, each MC trying to one-up the other with 
his signature style. “I got watches I ain’t seen in 
months, apartment in the Trump I only slept in 
once,” slangs Jay, to which Nas replies, “Old cribs I 
sold y’all drive by like monuments/ Google-Earth 
Nas, I got flats in other continents.”

After relistening to the album a million times, 
I find my inner hip-hop head and critical analyst 
at odds. Overall, this is easily Jay’s best since the 
Black Album — or maybe even the Blueprint. Still, 
the whole “unofficial soundtrack” deal is pretty 
weak, considering its only evidence is some Frank 
Lucas namedrops and overdramatic soundbytes. 
I can’t decide if he’s using the whole motif as a 
poor excuse to be rapping about coke and murder 
while pushing 40 years old (albeit far better than-
most) — perhaps because his attempt at grown-
man rap didn’t pan out — or if this is just the best 
lame-concept album out there.

But all this is almost irrelevant. What matters 
is that 11 years after his debut, Jay-Z is beyond 
relevant; his albums are still talked-about events, 
whether the hype is good or bad; and the music, 
the real heart of it all, is still thumping harder 
than ever.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  13

on Wednesday night for the weekend performances 
that will officially introduce him to UCSD and its 
surrounding community, his intuitive interactions 
with the symphony’s parts were softly intellectual yet 
always firm, settling small complications arising in 
the sea of music stands and instruments (“Let’s get 
the string section to slide back toward the brass”), 
requesting tweaks to performative interpretation 
(“At five, full half notes, so we can really hear the 
release”) and letting each instrument — the harp, 
the oboe, the clarinet — play alone until it’s ready to 
become a perfect part of the sum.

And everything must be perfect. After all, the 
mantelpiece of Schick’s self-welcoming performance 
is also the American premiere of “Cello Concerto,”  
penned by contemporary legend Philip Glass, best 
known for avant-garde minimalism that electro-
cuted the 1970s and most popular for collabora-
tions with public innovators like Brian Eno and 
Aphex Twin. “It’s very interesting about being star-
struck by the people you work with,” Schick said. 
“Immediately, you have to get down to work, and it 
becomes something very, very different.”

Here at UCSD, Schick is a dorm-room name for one 
reason more than others: Up until this year, he’s helmed 
the wildly sought-after Beatles course, which has always 
been more of a stepping stone to 20th-century music 
theory than a character study of the Fab Four. “I don’t 
actually care about the Beatles that much,” he said. 
“Sometimes I don’t even like the Beatles — but the 
spectrum that they cover is so huge.”

Now, after over 20 years of the same stepping 
stone, Schick is moving on to a personal boulder. 
While starring cellist Wendy Sutter jerked and 
sawed through Glass’ surprisingly gorgeous com-
position during rehearsal — a bodily visual of the 
composer’s vigorous repitition — Schick towered 
above, finally putting his lecturer’s countenance and 
percussive background to all-encompassing use.

Steven Schick will debut as music director for the 
La Jolla Symphony on Nov. 3 and 4 at Mandeville 
Auditorium. The symphony will perform John Luther 
Adams’ The Light That Fills the World, Philip Glass’s 
Cello Concerto and Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony. 
Philip Glass is expected to attend.

festival-favorite seems to receive is for its 
inability to explain the method to Curtis 
and the band’s unlikely genius. In timeline 
sequence, the film runs a highly simplis-
tic, unanalytical course between one man’s 
personal and public turmoil (mostly set in 
Macclesfield, England, the no-breathing-
room hometown that Curtis never left). Every 
monumental life decision — marriage, baby, 
mistress — is represented in short, detached 
clips stripped of all unnecessary dialogue and 
score, which does chisel for us all the cold, 
oft-silent beauty of Curtis’ world, but pays for 
its aesthetic with a deficiency in clues as to Joy 
Division’s most buried secret: Where on earth 
did that sound come from? Surely, no arbi-
trary sum of influences could have let loose 
the tumbling, whirring, scraping obsessions 
of their loosened strings, stalked by a percus-
sive hunger, stricken with the untrained voice 
of human isolation itself — all in the most 
minimal, animalistic ways possible, hollow 
and huge and yet so unassuming as to seem 
almost nonmusical in nature. Surely, no acci-
dent?

The singular abstracted scene in “Control” 
is set to the not-yet-existing electro-paranoia 
of remaining-member offspring New Order 
in an unexplained whirl of psychedelic hyp-
nosis performed by bandmate Peter Hook 
(played to bloke-ish perfection by “Across 
the Universe” talent Joe Anderson). We learn 
almost less in taking Corbijn’s filmic journey 
than we could from picking through Curtis’ 
short stock of literal and self-revealing lyr-
ics, used consistently in the film to illustrate 
the author’s inner turbulence. “Asylums with 
doors open wide/ Where people had paid to 
see inside/ For entertainment they watch his 
body twist/ Behind his eyes he says, ‘I still 
exist,’” groans Curtis in “Atrocity Exhibition,” 

what would be the opening track for his 
posthumous sophomore release. And that 
performative march-twist to which he refers 
— essentially an upright, half-controlled sei-
zure to the pulse of his band’s dark form — is 
replicated to a sweaty, convulsive T by the 
talented Riley, so accurate in his embodiment 
of Curtis’ every nuance that we almost feel 
brushed by the star himself. 

So for now, genius — particularly of the 

musical breed — stays safely locked in the 
mysteries of the authorless human blueprint. 
Perhaps without such a frustrating void, it 
would be difficult to even begin to grasp 
Curtis’ depression; “Control” lets us feel that 
it was the lack of answers, the incurable 
and side-effecting epilepsy, an idol’s inevitable 
seclusion — and the goddamn quiet that blan-
keted him into nonexistence. And in quiet, he 
should rest.

14  HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2007

Harlem street corners. 
Surprisingly, the film’s embodi-

ment of blunt-force attraction isn’t 
Washington — whose affinity for 
bad-assery is hardly surprising — but 
Russell Crowe’s Richie Roberts, the 
Jersey narcotics cop trailing Lucas. 
Crowe trudges around his dank scen-
ery like a broad-shouldered bear, 
bubbling with a subsurface brutal-
ity that Scott deftly controls to turn 
every scrap of violence into a gratify-
ing payoff.

Roberts and Lucas form the film’s 
centerpiece, both men acting as com-
mentary on the nation’s standing in 
the ’60s, the decade-long apex of U.S. 
history — when the hippie faced down 
the Man, when the little guy faced 
down the corporation and when all 
Americans had to face mass change. 
The two mainstay characters stand on 
opposing sides, but with similar val-
ues: Lucas touts familial honor while 
Roberts preaches on-the-job morals. 

Neither mindset mixes well with its 
respective milieus. Lucas’ drug trade,  
described in-film like old-school eco-
nomics, imports the product fresh 
Asian opium to Harlem’s customers. 

But even Lucas can’t stop his formerly 
understated, family-run hustle from 
becoming a showy empire. New-school 
flash — including Nicky Barnes, per-
sonified with pimpalicious zest by 
Cuba Gooding Jr. — leaves Lucas wor-
riedly trying to keep his younger rela-
tives (played by T.I., Chiwetel Ejiofor, 
Common and others) in line to ensure 
the whole family’s safety, but it’s like 
playing Whack-A-Mole: family, money 
and business can’t ever jive.

Meanwhile, Roberts’ headstrong 
ethics earn him many enemies. In the 
vein of “Serpico,” Roberts is all but 
exiled by his cop buddies when he 
turns in $1 million in corrupt cash, 
instead of taking a taste for himself. 
Crowe somberly carries the decision 
like a concrete block for the rest of the 
film, never frantically acting out like Al 
Pacino, whose many tirades as Frank 
Serpico made the character impulsively 
entertaining. Instead, Roberts stead-
fastly holds himself to his moral code, 
watching as the rest of his life (wife, 
kid and job) floats away — there’s a 
wonderfully played solemnity to the 
character.

The rest of the cast is made up of 
gangster-genre vets, with the film trans-

planting bit-part actors of every crime 
show and film from “The Sopranos” 
(Robert Funaro) to “The Wire” (Idris 
Elba) to “The Departed” itself (Kevin 
Corrigan). All of gangster-ism’s stars 
have gathered around Washington and 
Crowe, swirling about to tell one of 
the most riveting American tales of 
drugs, family and the law ever put on 
the screen.

And while scribe Steven Zaillian’s 
characterizations are reason enough 
to see “Gangster,” Scott’s direction 
puts the film a cut above most cops-
and-robbers tales. What Martin 
Scorsese did to stylize and beautify 
carnage in “Departed” — the last 
great crime epic — is undone in 
“Gangster,” where Scott preserves 
Harlem’s violent grit and grime. 
Instead of lovemaking to the sounds of 
Pink Floyd, we get crack distribution 
to Sam & Dave. Instead of Howard 
Shore’s guitar-plucking score, we get 
a drum-thumping outing from Marc 
Streitenfeld and an awing rendition 
of “Ave Maria,” played over an end-
sequence’s church setting. “Gangster” 
is on par with “Departed” in all facets, 
but delivers in a more visceral, primi-
tive way.

GANGLAND EPIC SHOOTS FOR MIXED MORALS

ing off our low-gravity planet. David 
begins well enough, embracing this 
love-starved child who copes with oth-
ers about as well as a snail with table 
salt. At first, the surrogate father is 
captivated by what everyone mistakes 
as quirky individuality, only to stumble 
soon after as it becomes painfully clear 
how emotionally disturbed Dennis 
really is. 

Perhaps in the spirit of hallow-
een, this monstrously abnormal child 
was intended to frighten rather than 
endear — but that’s doubtfully the 
case. Where Kevin Spacey’s Prot was 
harmlessly charming and lovable, 
little Dennis is downright disturbing. 
He steals, he lies, he hangs upside 
down — and there’s an unending 
anticipation that, at any minute, his 
head will begin to spin out of its 
socket.

But David’s head is already spin-
ning as he tries to overcome crippling 
grief while dealing with the intro-
duction of an adopted child, and all 
during a scramble to meet his latest 
book’s deadline. But these conflicts 
are merely cursory, further beached 
by a limited cast of rangeless char-
acters that do little else to engage the 
audience than work themselves into 
an emotional mess.

Playing the devil’s advocate to 
David’s starry-eyed idealism is his sister 
Liz, played by Cusack’s real-life sister 
Joan — because, as we know, where 
one goes, the other never fails to fol-
low. Whether out of fierce dedication 
to method acting or simply spineless 
casting, the siblings deliver their pat-
ented squeaky hysterics while Harlee 
(Amanda Peet) fills the generic role of 
best-friend/pseudo-love-interest who 
complicates everything. David and 
Harlee’s moments of accidental inti-
macy are overwrought and easily over-
looked, while their mutual compas-

sion and unflinching understanding for 
Dennis comes too easily to believe.

While the trio struggles to accul-
turate Dennis to the real world, 
menacing adoption-agency rep Mr. 
Lefkowitz (played by the grossly tal-
ented Richard Schiff of TV’s “The 
West Wing”) threatens to take Dennis 
back for almost no discernible reason 
— other than, of course, the script’s 
submission to orphan-story arche-
types. Were it not for such uninspired 
scenes and dialogue, this talented cast 
and unusual plot could have made 
for a heartwarming, even enjoyable, 
story; instead, the movie faceplants 
on a Hollywood slab of banality, with 
the usual tugging of frayed heart-
strings and the endless torture of 
bloodied clichés, with the only excep-
tional performances coming from 
Schiff and the dopey he-Cusack.

Like toddlers swinging waffle 
bats, director Menno Meyjes and his 
screenwriting team attempt to attach 
legitimacy to this unlikely (though 
unabashedly stolen) tale with brutally 
obvious symbolism. From the undis-
guised metaphor of Dennis’ sunlight 
sensitivity to his social anxiety, and 
his fear of floating away to fear of 
abandonment, the film is an endless 
parade of crudely disguised childhood 
alienation commentary. The film’s cre-
ators show not even a hint of serious 
interest in mental disorders — a topic 
much deserving of attention — instead 
keeping the focus as family-safe as 
possible by endlessly entertaining the 
notion that the kid might actually be 
from Mars. Cutesy demonstrations like 
switching on a street light with pure 
force of will and guessing an M&M’s 
flavor while blindfolded — to prove 
Dennis can taste colors (except blue, 
of course) — drive us to the edge.   
We’re much more ready to strangle 
the creepy little albino than see his 
dilemma to its reassuring end.

University and Ching and Sven-David 
Ruff of Saint Mary’s College by identi-
cal scores of 8-3.

In his singles debut, Becker 
faced some quality action in flight 
C of the main draw. After a tough 
6-2, 4-6, 6-1 loss to the University 
of Washington’s Skyler Tateishi, 
Becker notched his first career vic-
tory by beating Silvio Chiba of UC 
Santa Cruz 7-6(6), 6-3. Steidlmayer 
expects Becker to continue making 
strides and help the UCSD tennis 
team as the year progresses.

Becker and the rest of the Tritons 
will look to impress their Division-
I competition at the upcoming 16-
team ITA National Indoor Tennis 
Chamionship on Nov. 1 through Nov. 

4.
Meister is definitely looking to 

improve on his performance in the 
Chandler Cup.

 “I like our chances much bet-
ter in Ohio at the upcoming Indoor 
Championships because the indoor 
courts really suit me and Eric’s game 
well.  The key for us in that tourna-
ment will be our serve; when we’re 
serving well, we are a tough doubles 
team to beat.”

After the ITA Championships 
end, the fall portion of UCSD’s ten-
nis season — considered the indi-
vidual segment — will conclude and 
the team will be out of action for 
four months before its season begins 
again with a trip to UC Riverside to 
face the Highlanders on Feb. 1.

for the final home game of the 2007 
season, with many parents visibly 
— and vocally — in attendance. 

“It was a real good crowd for the 
last game,” Lai said. “We even got 
a better crowd than what the guys’ 
team brought out. It was really nice 
to play in front of my family and 
friends.”

The upcoming CCAA champion-
ships and NCAA regionals will offer 
these Triton veterans the chance to get 
at least a few more games in the Triton 
blue and white. The teammates will 
hopefully achieve their goal since first 
putting on a UCSD jersey: a national 
championship.

with the way we ended and the fact 
that we are going to have a number 
of good players coming back to the 
program next year.”

Edwards did, however, give 
Holohan a vote of confidence based 
on the Tritons’ outstanding finale.

“Paul probably will be one of the 
candidates,” Edwards said. “He did a 
good job at the end of the season. As 
far as being part of the process, I’m 
sure he’ll be one of the top candi-
dates and we’ll see how he compares 
with the rest.”

Holohan said he understood the 
school’s position but added that he 
wants the job.

“I understand that they have to 
do a national search,” Holohan said. 

“I would really love the opportunity. 
On the soccer field, I think it’s shown 
that we did really well on the soccer 
team.”

Holohan certainly has support 
from his former players to continue 
into next season as head coach. 

“He did really exceptional,” Levy 
said. “He took a team that was shocked 
after [Armstrong] retired and lost a 
lot of games. We were kind of getting 
down and he brought us up and we 
won our first game with him. He gave 
us great pre-game speeches. It’s great 
to have a young coach who we can 
relate to. It could be a good thing for 
the program to get fresh faces but Paul 
did a great job. The team is a close-
knit team, so whoever it is it’ll be a 
strong team.”

The UCSD women’s soccer team 
put forth a merciless offensive 
attack against rival Cal State San 
Bernardino on Oct. 30 that yielded 
no immediate results. Despite their 
efforts, the Tritons were unable to 
scratch out a game-winning goal, 
settling for a 0-0 draw. The game 
was the last of the regular season, 
and left the 17th-ranked Tritons 
with a 12-2-2 overall record (9-2-2 
CCAA). 

The team will now travel to 
Carson, Calif. to participate in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship. With 29 
standing points, UCSD ended its 
season as the Southern Division’s 
first-place squad, giving them the 
No. 2 seed in the upcoming champi-
onships. In the first round on Nov. 
2, the Tritons will face off against 
third-ranked Cal State Los Angeles.

Last week’s fires wreaked havoc 
on the soccer schedule, postponing 
the weekend’s games and cutting 
into the pre-playoff downtime. The 
poor air quality forced the Tritons to 
shake up their normal routine.

“All of last week we practiced 
inside the gym and we really only 
got one, maybe two good days out 
on the field,” senior midfielder Ali 
Lai said. “It definitely killed our 
momentum that we have had in the 
last few weeks, but we’ll be fine for 

the playoffs.”
While UCSD was able to play 

against Cal State San Bernardino 
at night, its match against Cal Poly 
Pomona was canceled. Because the 
rescheduled game would have taken 
place during the week, the Cal Poly 
Pomona team was afraid that travel 
would have affected its players’ mid-
terms, instead opting to cancel the 
match.

According to head coach Brian 
McManus, the Tritons would have 
liked the practice.

“The Pomona game was obvi-
ously disappointing not being able 
to get that game in,” McManus said. 
“That will be something that gets 
brought up at the conference meet-
ings this weekend.”

Although Cal Poly Pomona for-
feited its game and UCSD received 
zero standing points, the team’s 
dominance over the first half of the 
year guaranteed their eventual place 
atop the division standings. 

It was clear the Tritons did 
not take the tie against Cal State 
San Bernardino for want of scor-
ing opportunities. UCSD outshot 
its opponents 21-5 and completely 
dominated the time of possession. 
As has been the case in its past few 
matches, the team was unable to 
capitalize on its many chances and 
claw across a goal.

The game started with both 
teams playing at a relatively slower 
pace and merely exchanging pos-

sessions. Toward the end of the first 
half, the Tritons regained their legs 
and started attacking. Despite con-
trolling the ball for the whole game, 
the team seemed unable to create 
open looks near the net and could 
not connect more than a few solid 
passes deep in San Bernardino ter-
ritory.

McManus was proud of his team 
for quickly readjusting after its 
week off and for gaining some good 

momentum heading into playoffs.
“From the last 15 minutes of 

the first half on we really domi-
nated the game,” he said. “The only 
danger was the breakaway, but that 
was only because we were trying 
so hard to win. Give [Cal State San 
Bernardino] credit, they defended 
well with the keeper coming up with 
some pretty big saves. If we had had 
a few better shots in the box we 
would have nicked it.”

Per tradition, the last home game 
of the season was Senior Night, 
when all the graduating seniors are 
honored. Leaving after this season 
will be defenders Stacy Johnson, Alie 
Avina, and Nicole Pepper; midfield-
ers Lai, Chelsey Campbell, Caitlin 
Ryan and Rachel Lindenfel; and for-
wards Kathy Sepulveda and Lauren 
Segars. A large crowd turned out

After a horrible start to the sea-
son, the UCSD men’s soccer team 
has made a remarkable turnaround 
in its second half, which was capped 
off by a 2-1 win against California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
opponent Cal State San Bernardino 
on Oct. 29. 

The win improved the team’s 
overall record to 5-9-3, 4-6-3 in 
CCAA play and extended its unde-
feated streak to four games. 

In their first game back after the 
wildfires, the Tritons took an early 
lead, as senior captain Josh Levy 
scored his first career collegiate goal 
on Senior Day.

Levy had little to say about scor-
ing his only goal on the last game 
of his collegiate career, but it was 
clear that he had been hoping to for 
a while.

“It’s about time,” he said. 
The game was tied 1-1 late into 

the second half and seemed des-
tined for overtime until junior for-
ward Tom Caplan scored after his 
shot deflected off a Cal State San 
Bernardino player and into the goal 
with just under four minutes left in 
the game.

Interim head coach Paul Holohan 
praised the team’s effort during the 
game and throughout the second 
half of the season.

“I thought the team did very well,” 
Holohan said. “Their commitment 
has been excellent and I couldn’t ask 
for any more. The young ones that 
we got playing are all doing really 
well and I just think that there is a 
bright future ahead.”

With the squad eliminated 
from the playoffs last weekend, the 
team tried to make the most of its 
last match by finishing the season 
strong. 

“Obviously we were pretty 
bummed,” Levy said. “We all knew 
that we should have had the playoffs 
in our hands and not rely on other 
teams.”

Holohan echoed his veteran 

defender’s sentiment.
“We knew that we had to win all 

our games,” he said. “It was disap-
pointing at the time but we were 
relying on other people as well.”

Despite posting a sub .500 record 
for the second consecutive season, 
the team still has a positive outlook 
toward next season. 

“We were definitely a lot bet-
ter,” Levy said. “We were a lot more 
focused and had a goal to win as 
many games as we could. It was defi-
nitely a great end of the year and — 
especially for the young guys — they 
should be solid next year.”

With the end of a very tumul-
tuous season that included former 
head coach Derek Armstrong’s sud-
den retirement midway through the 
year, the biggest question going into 

the offseason will be the head coach-
ing vacancy.

Athletic Director Earl Edwards 
said that while Holohan has done 
a good job with the team, the ath-
letic department will still conduct an 
extensive search.

“Paul did a good job as the 
interim head coach and we’re really 
pleased with the way we finished at 
the end of the season, particularly 
for the seniors,” Edwards said. “I’m 
actually really pleased looking at 
the future of our program because 
it’s obvious we have some good ath-
letes, but as far as the head coaching 
position is concerned we will do a 
national search and see how that 
plays out for us. But I’m really happy

The UCSD men’s tennis team took 
the court for the Chandler Cup on the 
weekend of Oct. 26 through Oct. 28, 
a prestigious three-day event featur-
ing Division-I competition that took 
place at UC Berkley. The tourna-
ment was comprised of three separate 
singles and doubles draws, including 
a consolation bracket for each. Head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer sent five of 
his top players to fill the four singles 
and two doubles slots that were allot-
ted to the Tritons; sophomore Bijan 
Moallemi and seniors Eric Rubens 
and Blake Meister each played both 
ways, with sophomore Chad Becker 
making his Triton debut in singles 
and sophomore Alex Placek team-
ing with Moallemi in the doubles 
competition.

Rubens and Meister started the 
season on a roll and looked to con-
tinue their dominance heading into 
the tournament. Seeded fourth in 
flight A of the doubles tournament, 
the seniors were expecting to face 
stiff competition, but the challenge 
came much earlier than expected. 
Rubens and Meister went 0-2 at UC 
Berkley, losing their first match in 
the main draw as well as the con-
solation bracket. Tobi Obenaus and 
Patrick Fisher of the University of 
Washington eliminated them in the 
16th round with an 8-3 score. Then, 
in the first round of consolation, the 
duo fell to Piotr Dilaj and Stanley 
Sarapanic of Boise State University by 
a score of 8-4. 

“I came out a bit rusty in my dou-
bles matches last weekend,” Meister 
said, pointing out that the fires that 
ravaged San Diego prevented many of 
UCSD’s top players from practicing 
leading up to the Chandler Cup.

In singles, Meister was dealt a 
difficult first round matchup with 
fourth-seed Artem Gramma of Pacific 
University who took the doubles 
champ down rather quickly, 6-2, 6-0. 

However, the talented senior won two 
matches in consolation before losing 
a three-set thriller to Stefan Nikolic of 
Loyola Marymount University, 7-5, 
6-7(5), (10-6). 

Rubens, meanwhile, rebounded 
from a 7-6(6), 6-2 first-round loss 
in flight B to take the singles conso-
lation title. After the disappointing 
defeat in his opening match, Rubens 
ran through the losers’ bracket with 
little trouble. Starting with a 6-2, 6-2 
win over Henri Landes of UC Davis, 
Rubens followed up his impressive 
performance with an entertaining 
4-6, 6-3, (10-6) come-from-behind 
victory over Holden Ching from 
Saint Mary’s College of California. 
In the semifinal round, Johan Berhof 
of Loyola Marymount University 
offered little resistance as Rubens dis-
posed of him 6-1, 6-1. In the finals, 
Rubens made amends for Meister’s 
loss by serving up a double bagel in a 
6-0, 6-0 win to dispose of Nikolic. 

Moallemi, designated to flight A 
in singles, started quickly by win-
ning his two singles matches on Oct. 
26. In the first round, he took out 
second-seed Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan 
of the University of Washington by a 
routine score of 6-3, 6-4. In the 16th 
round later that day, Moallemi faced 
a stiff test from Phil Kao of Stanford, 
but fought hard to score an impres-
sive 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 victory. The soph-
omore’s singles run ended the next 
day, however, in a 6-1, 6-1 loss to fifth 
seed and eventual champion of flight 
A, Bo Katsarov of UC Berkley. 

Moallemi and Placek had an 
encouraging run in the flight B dou-
bles tournament, making it to the 
semifinals before falling to the UC 
Santa Cruz duo of Jared Kamel and 
Marc Vartabedian at 8-5. Kamel and 
Vartabedian would go on to take home 
the flight B championship. During 
their run to the final four, Moallemi 
and Placek took out Austin Kakar 
and Vergerd Veskimagi of Pacific
