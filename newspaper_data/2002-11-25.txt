Campus to face challenges 
Dynes delivers State of Campus address 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editor 

Chancellor Robert C Dynes 
spoke of the challenges faci ng a 
maturing UCSD and of how the 
university will come to redefine 
what a research university is in the 
next decade during his annual State 
of the Campus Address on Nov. 22 
in Price Center Ballroom. 

Dynes described UCSD as hav-
ing a "tradition of no tradition" 
that allows the university to inno-
vate. He commended UCSD's rise 
in status among research universi-
ties to among the top half-dozen 
universities in the country since he 
became chancellor in 1996. 

"I don't want us to JUSt follow 
those other schools," Dynes said 
to a lunchtime crowd of about 170 
individuals. "I want us to detine 
what a university is going to look 
like in the next decade." 

Dynes outlined four challenges 
to the university's mission of edu-
cation, research and public ser-

vice. Particularly, he spoke of 
finding the strengths of the cam-
pus' educational institutions, 
increasing diversity across many 
fields, accommodating the 
increasing enrollment and main-
taining research support. On the 
last point, the chancellor noted 
that despite Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography's centennial cele-
bration, the state'!> budget shortfall 
has led to a 10 percent cut in 
research funding as well as some 
employees being laid off. 

To address these four chal-
lc:nges, Dynes announced the 
launch of an institutional cam-
paign to broaden UCSD's base of 
financial support and to increase 
public awareness of the university's 
tripartite mission. The campaign, 
which will support the academic 
mission of UCSD, will increase 
support for student scholarships 
and graduate fellowships, as well 
as increase faculty recruitment and 
retention, new academic programs 
and health care research. 

Marshall Week ends 
with author's lecture 

By GAELLE FAURE 
Staff Writer 

Randall Kennedy, a Harvard 
Law School professor, award-
winning author and former law 
clerk to Justice Thurgood 
Marshall, gave a lecture com-
memorating the former 
Supreme Court justice's career 
to a packed Mandeville 
Auditorium on Nov. 22, wrap-
ping up Thurgood Marshall 
College'S first annual Thurgood 
Marshall Week. 

Kennedy, author of "Race, 
Crime and the Law" and the 

recently published and contro-
versial "Nigger: The Strange 
Career of a Troublesome 
Word," worked closely with 
Marshall in researching cases 
throughout 1983 and 1984. 

The lecture was preceded by 
a dinner reception, during 
which Kennedy spoke with 
Marshall students. Tim Lessler, 
a Marshall freshman, attended 
the dinner. 

"He told really interesting 
stories about Marshall's cases," 
Lessler said. "It made what the

Faculty at the University of 
California praised the university's 
new policy of using comprehensive 
review to evaluate all freshman 
applications, stating in a recent 
report that the new methods 
uphold the academic strength of 
the freshman class. 

"Preserving the University of 
California's high academic standards 
is a top priority for the faculty," said 
Gayle N . Binion, chair of the sys-
tem-wide Academic Senate and a 
professor of political science at 
University of California at Santa 
Barbara. "The faculty conducted a 
very thorough analysis of compre-
hensive review and found that it was 
implemented in accordance with 
Regents' policy and in a manner 
that has maintained consistency in 
UC admissions."

ISO urges resistance to 
war in Iraq at forum 
Community members voice 

concerns over prospects of force 
By MAn SCHRADER 

Senior Staff Writer 

The looming possibility of a new 
war with Iraq compelled the 
International Socialist Organization 
to hold an educational forum Nov. 
21 in Center Hall with the intent of 
boosting campus resistance toward 
another Persian Gulf conflict. 

"I wish there were more people 
there, but I thought the event was 
excellent," said graduate! student 
Carl Sachs. "I thought the speakers 
were very well-spoken and had 

control of the facts ." 
The event, which was attended 

by about 80 individuals, featured 
presentations by members of the 
ISO, the UCSD Peace Coalition 
and Srudents for Justice, all of whom 
wished to express their concerns 
about a new U.S. war with Iraq . 

Though small in size, the event 
did spark good discussion, accord-
ing to UCSD junior Rebecca 
Anshell, who was the master of cer-
emonies of the event.

UC asks state to declare 
C.U.E. talks at impasse 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News-Editor 

Citing " remaining significant 
differences," the University of 
California requested that the state 
Public Employment Relations 
Board declare that an impasse has 
been reached in the negotiations 
between the university and the 
Coalition of University Employees 
union, and that the board appoint a 
third-party mediator. 

The University of California 
released a statement Nov. 18 
declaring an impasse, but the forms 
were not filed until later in the 
week, according to UC spokesman 
Paul Schwartz. On Nov. 14, the 
university asked CU.E. to join in 
declaring a mutual impasse, stating 
the university "had no further 
movement to make" following a 
Nov. 13 proposal by the union.

Part of the process to i(1crease data-trans-
fer speed at SDSC included expanding its disk 
storage capacity, adding new higher-<lensity 
tapes and adding faster tape drives from 
Storage Technology Corp. The center also 
imported new technology, such as switches 
from Brocade Communications Systems, 
fibre channel adapters from Qlogic and end-
tcrend systems from Sun Microsystems. 

SDSC is also replacing its 20-gigabyte-
capacity tape cartridges with 200-glgabyte 
native capacity tape cartridges that are 
manipulated robotically in five silos with a 
total storage capacity of six petabytes. 

The recent and planned improvements 
will enable the center to deliver the 
unprecedented data-management infra-
structure required by the National Science 
Foundation's $88 million TeraGrid Project, 
which will become the world's largest 
fastest distributed infrastructure for open 
scientific research in 2003. Of the five sites 
involved in the TeraGrid project, SDSC is the 
lead site for the National Partnership for

Historian to give ledure on 
gentiles' role in Holocaust 

A free lecture on '1he Righteous Non-
Jews Who Helped Jews During the Second 
World War" will be given by historian Sir 
Martin Gilbert on Dec. 2 at 7 p.m. in Price 
Center Ballroom A. 

In his speech, Gilbert will tell how many 
gentiles risked their careers and lives to con-
ceal and rescue Jewish refugees while the 
Third Reich carried out its program to exter-
minate Eu ropean Jewry. His stories about 
"the righteous' will include those of Raoul 
Wallenberg and Oskar Schindler, as well as 
less-famous historical figures. 

Gilbert, the Herman Wouk Distinguished 
Visiting Professor in Judaic Studies at UCSD, 
is one of the 20th century's foremost histori-
ans of World War II, the Holocaust and the 
founding of modem Israel. He has published 
two comprehensive general histories on both 
world wars. Gilbert has also published '1he 
Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy" and 'Jewish 
History Atlas," and he wrote the script of the 
Academy Award-winning film "Genocide:' 

In addition to these accomplishments, 
Gilbert became Winston Churchill's official 
biographer in 1968 and published six vol-
umes of Churchill's biography.

which IS sponsored by Price Charities and the 
Judaic Studies Program, call (858) 534-

Impasse.: C.U.E. against declaration 
continued from page I 

PERB, a state agency headed by five board 
members appointed by the governor, has five 
business days from the filing date to decide if 
negotiations are at an impasse. If it is deter-
mined that the parties are at an impasse, 
PERB will make a formal declaration and 
State Mediation and Conciliation Service will 
appoint a mediator. 

If progress fails to be made, then the 
groups will enter a fact-finding phase led by a 
neutral arbiter and will prepare a non-binding 
advisory report to help the parties reach a set-
tlement. 

Sally Hampton, local 5 president of 
C.U.E. and a book restorer at Geisel Library, 
said the union does not agree that the negoti-
ations are at an impasse and also said that 
declaring a formal impasse would be unfavor-

able for the union. 
"They can implement anything they want 

to," she said. "We do not agree to an impasse." 
Gayle Cieszkiewiez, executive director of 

UC labor relations, said that the neg!ltiations 
needed to corne to an end. 

"We're offering the best wages possible, 
given the state budget crisis and its impact on 
UC salaries, but the union continues to 
demand wage increases that far exceed avail-
able funding and would amount to preferen-
tial salary treatment for clerical employees," 
Cieszkiewicz aid . 

C.U.E. want the university to offer cleri -
cal workers a IS percent salary increase, 10 
times higher than the 1.5 percent the univer-
sity has offered all its employees. The univer-
sity sa)'ll that the poor state economy and lean 
budget are to blame for low incr~se.

Address: Dynes may be sought for UC pres. 
continued from [lage I 

part mission, including the neuro-
sciences program and the homeland 
security division at UCSD. 

Dynes recalled WII and huw it 
changed the demands made on 
research , o;cholar~hip :10«1 the acad-
eme. He lauded a collaboration 
between San Diego State University 
and UC D to serve as neutral bro-
kers in coordinating a first-response 
to ,I terrorist attack in the San Diego 
region. The collaboration, he said, 
is a model for the coun try. 

Additionally, he stressed the 
need to increase sc holarship and 
under tanding of Arab and Muslim 
culmres and languages. 

The chancellor also defended 
his belief in a need to moderate free 

speech with mutual respect for mh-
ers as outlined in the UCSD 
Principles of Community. He did 
not cite any specific instances or 
groups by name. 

"We have to bend over back-
wards ro be sure that we promme 
tolerance for different opinions and 
allow different opinions to be 
voiced," he said. "But I do not regret 
speaking Out forcefully against pub-
lic speech that is deliberatively hos-
tile to individuals or groups JUSt 
because they are differenr." 

Speaking to university employ-
ees, the chancellor addressed the 
effects of the budget on employees' 
salaries, sharing the sentiments of 
many employees by calling the 1.5 
percent salary increases "lousy." 

\Vhen asked if he wanted to 
become president of the University 
of California, Dynes reiterated his 
affection for UCSD, yet left the 
open possibility of succeeding 
Richard C. Atkinson, who served as 
chancellor ofUCSD before becom-
ing U president in 1995 . 

"Asking me whether I want to 
be the president of the University 
of California is like putting a hock-
ey puck in front or a hockey play-
er," he said to a laughing audience. 
"I'll be genuinely honest with you: 
I'm hopi ng they don't ask." 

The address was the second of 
three - the first taking place on 
Nov. 20 at the UCSD Medical 
Center in Hillcrest and the third to 
take place on ov. 26 at SIO. 

Kennedy: Justice fought for integration 
continued from page I 

college is about seem more rele-
vant. The whole week was a great 
way to bring the college together." 

Kennedy'S lecture traced 
Marshall's long career as a lawyer 
and pioneer for black equality. 

"[Marshall] really has no peer," 
Kennedy said. "No lawyer in 
American history has had a career 
as broad as his." 

Marshall began his career as a 
civil attorney, first privately and 
subsequently as a lead lawyer for 
the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
He brought groundbreaking cases 
to the Supreme Court, including 
the 1954 landmark Br(JWTI v. Board of 
Educatiull case. which led to the 
desegregation of schools in the u.s. 

"Thurgood Marshall worked 
for a long time in the Jim Crow 
regime under the 'separate but 
equal' policies, bur he said, 'Fine, if 

they're separate but equal, then 
let's make sure they're equal, '" 
Kennedy said. 

Marshall was eventually 
appointed as the first black solicitor 
general by President John F. 
Kennedy and first black Supreme 
Court justice by President Lyndon 
B. Johnson. He served as a justice 
for 24 years, during which he com-
piled a distinctive record as a 
defender of freedom of speech, 
organized labor, and minority and 
gender equality. 

Kennedy also pointed out that, 
alongside Marshall's many accom-
plishments, some of his decisions 
must be looked at critically. 

"I think he was a great person, 
but great people in the crucible of 
politics have to face dilemmas and 
make decisions, and some that 
Thurgood Marshall made I think 
were regrettable," Kennedy said. 

This included the 1944 

K07'mlJJtm V. tbr United Stacu case 
in which a divided Supreme Court 
upheld that it was consrimtional for 
the U.s. military to force persons 
of Japanese ancestry to go to 
internment camps. Kennedy point-
ed alit that the NAACP did not file 
a brief on this case. 

Kennedy concluded by high-
lighting the importance of remem-
bering the career of Thurgood 
Marshall College'S namesake. 

"He was a person who had seen 
the darkest, ugliest, dreariest aspects 
of American society, bur was also a 
person who in his own life and 
career saw the promise of American 
life," Kennedy said. 

Thurgood Marshall Week 
included the Marshallpalooza! festi-
val ilnd a preview of the conunemo-
rative T hurgood Marshall stamp, 
which was unveiled by the U.S. 
Postal Service in September and will 
be circulated by January 2003 .

COMPREHENSIVE 

Personal essays provide more 
information on applicants than 

mere GPA and SAT scores 
By CORIN MACFARLANE 

Senior Staff Writer 

o one really enjoyed applying to col-
lege . It's a da \llning task to narrow yourself 
down to a few sheets of paper. Transcripts, a 
hst of extracurricular activities and a letter 
from a bruidance counselor with whom you 
spoke maybe twice - hardly an accurate 
portraY,11 of a complex individual. In such a 
context, every word has to count. 

The words that count the most as far as 
fleshing out an applicant are in the ever-so-
notorious essays. The reason those essays 
are such a cause of anxiety is because of the 
exten to which they fill in the 

has always been that it fails to take into con-
sideration things like a student's back-
ground , personal trials and individual hard-
ships. Amid constant contentions about the 
discriminatory aspects of standardized test-
ing and the inability of GPA to reRcct a stu-
dent 's true academic ability, an essay about 
one's experiences becomes incredibly 
important. 

It 's how you explain a faltering GPA due 
to switching high schools three times in 
three semesters. It's how you discuss the way 
discovering journalism affected your acade-

REVIEW 

Subjective comprehensive review 
process has opened the door to 

potential lies and plagiarism 
By DANIEL WATTS 

Associate'Opinion Editor 

It was nearly a year ago that the UC 
Regents announced the implementation of 
their backdoor affirmative action "compre-
hensive review" scheme. Mere weeks before 
the deadline for freshman applications, the 
new poli cy overhauled the admissions 
process, placing greater emphasis on subjec-
tive personal "hardships" and less on objec-
tive indicators like GPA and SAT scores. 
Various pundits predicted everything from 
an increase in racial diversity to widespread 
embellishment and fraud, since applicants 
scrambled to weave tales of 

ees contacting hundreds of high school 
counselors and family members to veri fy 
every aspect of the applications. 

Scrutinizing all UC applications is logis-
tically impossible. The cost of such an 
undertaking would be far too great, as 
proven by the University of California's 
decision to randomly spot-check onl y a 
small sample of this year's applications. For 
example, UCSD recently examined the self-
reported family income for 137 students and 
checked the honors and extracurricular 
activities of 300 other randomly selected 
students. Only one student was unable to 
provide documentation of honors and 

extracurriculars. This doesn't 
hardship and woe into their 
admissions essays. 

The need to randomly check 
applications for truthfulness 
combined with the relati vely 
stagnant racial composition at 
UCSD indicates that compre-

(ON mean, however, that the rest of the snldents didn 't find a way to lie and then provide verification with the help of a sympathetic high school counselor or a par-
ent concerned with their child 's 

hensive review has failed . It's 
failed both in its implied goal of increasing 
underrepresented students and in its stated 
goal of ensuring a more holistic evaluation 
of applicants. 

Comprehensive review does not evaluate 
applicants holistically; it evaluates their 
applications. On paper, an applicant could 
be an impoverished, dyslexic valedictorian 
with an alcoholic, abusive father. In reality, 
the same applicant could be the wealthy heir 
to a small fortune, with a picture-perfect 
family life. There's no way to know for sure 
unless every application is double-checked 
for accuracy. With tens of thousands of 
applications submitted to the University of 
California each year, this daunting task 
would require an army of new UC employ-

future. 
The UC Oftice of the 

President did its own background check on 40 
personal statements - by far the easiest por-
tion of the application to hlke - and found no 
falsified information . This 5nldy was useless, 
since 4{) personal tatements a~e statistically 
insif,tnificant when one considers the rest of 
the field consists of tens of thousands. 

Every essay needs to be checked for accu-
racy. If only 12 applicants out of every 
12,000 manage to lie on their applications 
and get away with it, that's sti ll 12 truthful 
applicants that have been screwed out of a 
college education.

"Guys' girls" are better 
than "girls' girls" 

Conversation with friend leads to 
discovery of new term 

basically 
Carrie Elizabeth Sklar 

I t's a policy of mine noT to learn new things about myself. Quite frankly, I think I'm dis-
turbing enough already, and I pre-
fer to spend my time pointing out 
why orher ptOplf are so fucked up. 

The other day, however, I was 
sitti ng around with a bunch of peo-
ple, doing absolutely nothing to 
better the condition of the world, 
when my friend Lauren informed 
me that I am a "guys' gi rl. " 

As you can imagine, this raised 
several important questions. What 
is a guys' girl? Is it a compliment or 
an insult? Is it the new politically 
correct term for "lesbian"? Does it 
mean I look like a guy) And per-
haps most important of all : Is this 
going to require me to kick 
Lauren's ass? 

Now, I don't know about you, 
but I don't like to be insulted with 
terms I don't understand. It's just 
rude. But when I asked Lauren if 
being a guys' girl was a good thing 
or a bad thing, she said, "It's not 
good or bad; it's just the way you 
are." 

That is nrofr a good sign. 
So, in what I thought was a mar-

velous display of maturity and edu-
cated inquisitiveness, I repl ied, 

"Oh. OK. Well fuck you, too, 
then." 

In fear of getting a guys' girl 
really pissed off (which 1 assumed 
to be a bad thing), Lauren quickly 
defined the term for me. 

Guys' gi rl : nOlin . A female who 
possesses or shares an affinity with 
men; a woman who enjoys or fre-
quently participates in male-domi-
nated activities or hobbies; the 
opposite of a "girls' girl;" not a les-
bian . 

Well, two things are definitely 
clear: Lauren spends WIJY too much 
time looking shit up in the dictio-
nary, and being a guys' girl is not an 
insult. Glad to have that cleared up. 

But now I have to wonder: What 
is it that makes me a guys' girl? Can 
I still be friends with girls? Do I 
have to grunt a lot and pretend to 
scratch balls I don 't have? Does 
being a guys' girl require some sort 
of government certificate) 

Well, I don't know what the 
answers to any of those questions 
are, really (except that I rffim to 
scratch my crotch - I have my 
principles). But here are some easy 
ways to figure out if you fall under 
the category of "guys' girl" or 
"girls' girl": 

You might be a guys' girl if you 
see yourself as Elaine from 
"Seinfeld." You might be a girls' 
girl if you see yourself as Rachel 
from "Friends." 

You might be a guys' girl if you 
can walk into a sports bar, watch a

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Carter unfairly criticizes Bush 
Ex .. president tries in vain to redeem himself 

By DumN fRELICH 
Staff Writer 

The Democrats are in sham-
bles. And as far as ex-presidents 
go, Jimmy Carter seems bent on 
joining Bill Clinton as another 
modern, can't-get-him-to-just-go-
away, oval office partisan. Ever 
since being named the Nobel 
Peace Prize recipient in October, 
Carter has adopted a persona of 
the hyper- beloved ex-president, 
starting off a media blitz that is no 
doubt tryi ng to help other promi-
nent Democrats do something 
about Bush's resonating power 
with the American people. 

Generally regarded as one of 
our most naive presidents, espe-
cially in foreign affai rs (remember 
the Iran Hostage Crisis?), Carter's 
reputation as a fabulous ex-presi-
dent now hangs in the balance. 
But that's not stopping his full-
fledged assault on the Bush 
ad ministration, leaving many 
wondering if Carter has lost his 
bearings once and for all. 

But this is nothing new for 
President Carrero For example, 
immediately after Bush delivered 
his "axis of evil" speech, Carter 
was quick to criticize. "I think it 
will take years before we can 
repair the damage done by [Bush's 
speech]," he said. But it was dur-
ing Carter's presidency that Iran, 
part of Bush's "axis of evi l," held 
American citizens captive for 
almost a year and a hal f. How eas-
ily Carter forgets. And his 
rhetoric has been increasing late-
ly. 

In an appearance on the 
CNN's "Larry King Live," Carter 
reaffirmed his lack of connection

with sane America, saying that the 
aim of the Carter Center, his 
think-tank for peace, is "to accom-
modate whatever situation we 
have and to try to bring ou t of it 
some resolution." 

The keyword here is "accom-
modate." The prevalence of ideal-
ism on the left - mainly, that we 
can negotiate with those who wish 
us harm - is exactly what caused 
the American people to usher in 
1 2 years of Republican rule start-
ing at the end of Carter's first 
term. And lest we forget Walter 
Mondale, the presidential candi-
date in 1984 and Carter's vice-
president, carried only his home 
state of Minnesota against Ronald 
Reagan, the immensely popular 
Republican candidate. 

Furthermore, an important 
aspect of the left's idealism -
that war is never a solur:on - is 
wholly false . It's completely the 
opposite - the defin ition of 
appeasement. And espeCially 
afrer witnessing ",hat the 
appeasement ideology accom-

WINTER QUARTER 

plished in the 20th century 
(World War II , anyone'), why do 
we constantly feel the need to 
revisit failed policies) As 1 recall, 
it was only after the world, fol -
lowing U .S. lead, turned away 
from isolationism and appease-
ment that Hitler was defeated , to 
the benefit of all. 

Racking up more points with 
liber.lls, Carter also think we 
need "to shift our attenti on to the 
prevention of despair an d hope-
lessness and suffering and anger 
and violence that might lead to 
terrorist acts." 

Funny, I thought our enemy 
was al Qaeda or Saddam Hussei n, 
not hopelessness and despair. And 
this is precisely the class warfare 
that we are expected to buy into as 
part of the blame-America-first 
crowd: Guilt must accompany 
those who aren't downtrodden . 
Last I checked, all of the 9/11 
hijackers were wealthy Saudis; bin 
Laden is a millionaire. I liken it 
more to the inability of others to 
accept our way oflife than Carter's 
preferred explanation . Besides, 
when does America's wealth and 
prosperity infringe on another 
group's ability to achieve their 
own sl ice of a limitless pie ' 

Switching topics to nuclear dis-
armament, Carter said, "The 
major powers need to set an exam-
ple." He goes on, "I think quite 
often the big countries that are 
responsible for the peace of the 
world set a very poor example ... 
we ... have to be willing to make 
some sacrifice on our own part."

Internet vulnerable to terror 
Attack on Web could destabilize economy 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Staff Writer 

Forget the Golden Gate Bridge. 
Forget the pace eedle and the 
White House. Forget the FBI 
Buildi ng. the Washington 
,\l onument and the BrookJyn 
Bridge. These buildings are safer 
froll1 terro rists than we think. 
R.lther than smoke and fire. a 
future terrorist attack is likely to be 
executed in the realm of intellectu-
al property - the anarchistic orgy 
we refer ro as the Internet. 

So sorely regulated that no one 
even has a decent idea of what's 
there, the Internet is a terrorist 
attack wai ting to happen. Thanks to 
Microsoft and the mere nature of 
the beast. it has such g'aping securi-
ry holes that anyone with a few 
minutes o n their hands and a rudi-
menrary knowledge of the Web's 
underpinnings could have a signifi-
cantly destnlctive effect in a few 
huurs. 

Our economy is in a less-than-
ideal state. yet the Internet is a 
hugely lucrative marketplace -
$3 .8 million worth of online sales 
were done in the Uruted States dur-
ing the week ending ov. lB. 
according to comScore Media 
Merrix. These factors are fortuirous 
in the eyes of someone wishing.to 
launch an Internet attack - any 
disruption of Internet conunerce.

it's taken several days to bring

A more creative hacker could 
modify cookies - small snippets of 
code insta lled on individual users' 
computers for traclcing and info 
purposes - for their own malicious 
purposes. Or an e-commerce Web 
site's code could be modified to col-
lect credit card numbers and send 
them to the hacker's computer. 
After the large-scale identiry theft 
that could follow the latter sort of 
attack, it would take years to rebuild 
consumer's confidence in the safety 
of shopping onl ine - remember 
how long it took to build such con-
fidence when e-commerce tirst

ical freedom. An anti-American 
Web nerd could launch an attack 
from literally any corner of the 
earth - thus avoiding the surveil-
lance that American computers are 
put under. Also. in any country but 
the United States. he would most 
likely find a similar group of like-
minded individuals to help rum 
(and possibly have a celebratory 
LAN party with him when the deed 
is done). 

Indeed. an Imernet attack 
wouldn't directly cause any loss of 
life, but the monetary loss would be 
staggering. the brunt of which 
would fall on the V .S. Forrester 
projects that e-commerce will be a 
$64.B billion market in 2003; that\; 
a $64.8 billion weakness. 

Additionally. it would take quite 
a while to identify the problem. 
debug code, assess damage, and 
bring things back to normal. And as 
I mentioned earlier and which was 
illustrated in the case of Sept. II . 
shaken nerves and raw fear can take 
forever to disappear. 

In light of this threat, Anlerica is 
faced with the questions, How 
much Internet surveillance is need-
ed. and how much is too much? 

Here enters the problem of 
jurisdiction. The Imernet reaches 
all corners of the earth. but the 
United States dominates it. and 
we're the ones who'd presumably 
be targeted in a terrorist attack. So 
do we police the world's Internet 
users from OUf soil even though our 
laws don't apply to them. or do we 
create an international organization 
to police everyone in the name of 
protecti ng America? Both options 
are morally and legally shaky; for 

the record. it looks like we're lean-
ing toward the fonner option. 

Recently a National 
Infras tructure Advisory Comrruttee 
was created which, according to its 
press release. "will make recom-
mendations regarding the security 
of the cyber and information sys-
tems of the United States' national 
security and economic critical infra-
structures. The committee will also 
examine ways that partnerships 
between the public and private sec-
tors can be erthanced to improve 
cyber security." The comrruttee is 
staffed by 24 people trom major 
sectors of the economy and is head-
ed by Richard K. Davidson of the 
Uruon Pacific Corporation. 

The "''hite House can create 
committee after committee and 
draft legislation until it turns blue in 
the face. but the Internet will never. 
by its very nature, be a fortress - or 
anything even approaching a 
fortress. 

Thus. protection against such 
an attack cannot come from the 
Internet itself; it must come from 
the U.S. economy. If our economy 
was as strong as it can and should 
be. a terrorist cell of computer 
nerds would have less reason ro 
launch an Internet-based attack 
because the effects of even the 
best-placed attack would be mini-
mal. 

For an analogous situation. 
think of a bridge: Bridges. by their 
very nature. are easy to attac)c. 
B1O\ving up a bridge destroys rrul-
lions of dollars worth of engineer-
ing. but the biggest problem creat-
ed by such an attack is the disrup-
tion of transportation. If the 
destroyed bridge was the sole artery 
between one place and another. its 
destruction would have a huge 
effect on mobility; but if the trans-
portation ~)'Stem was strengthened 
and diversified. the destruction of 
any single bridge wouldn't have 
such a crucial effect. Same with an 
Internet attack - if the American 
economy is strong enough. no sin-
gle attack. even through such a vul-
nerable portal as the Internet. 
would have a big enough effect for 
it to be considered a success from a 
terrorist's point of view. 

In short. the government 
ignores the sad state of the econo-
my. and focuses attention on form-
ing groups such as the National 
Infrastructure Advisory 
Committee. at its own peril. Doing 
whatever we can to improve the 
economy is the most ethically and 
legally sound measure we can take 
against the possibility of an Internet 
terrorist attack - and any sort of 
future attack. for that matter. For 
the moment. though, our weak 
economy and the nature of the 
Internet poses a great threat to 
national security.

The world is a dangerous place; in 
the imminent face of danger only 
the irrational puts down his 
weapon. hoping that the opposition 
won't take advantage. 

But what has caused the increas-
ing number of assaults on Bush's 
policy by Carter? Carter's winning 
of the Nobel Peace Prize wouldn't 
have anything to do with it. would 
it? In October, it was announced 
that Carter would be the latest 
recipient of the prize. the third 
U.S. president to be so named. But 
did Carter receive the prize on 
meri t alone? 

"[The Nobel Peace Prize) can 
and must also be seen as criticism 
of the line the current U.S. adrrun-
istration has taken on Iraq," said

even Yassar Arafat won a Nobel

Iraq: ISO 
advocates 

students to 
rethink war 

conrinued {rom page I 
"I thought th e night was very 

successful ," she said. " I thoughr a 
lot of good ideas were expressed 
and people were educated." 

Anna Bolotnikova, a member of 
the UCSD Peace Coalition, said 
that these educational forum are 
important to students beca use 
many do not understand the truth 
behind the state of the M iddle Ea t. 

"Problems ,Irise because Istu-
dents] are unin formed," she said. 
"Most students on campll don 't 
know enough about the war to 
really take a stand." 

In keeping with the beliefs of 
most of the other participants of 
th e forum, Bolotnikova stressed 
th at there should be no war or 
U .N . sanctions aga inst Iraq. 

"We are trying to build aware-
ness abour this war," she said. 
"This war is not just affectlllg Iraq. 
We are a part of this as well. " 

T.he third 'peaker, Chuck 
Stemke o f th e UCS D Peace 
Coa lition, gave a prest!ntation ahout 
th e Oct. 26 globa l protests over" 
war witll lraq . These rallies, which 
ranged in size from a few thollsand 
in Lo Angeles LO over a millioll in 
Florence, Italy, were prute tlng 
against the nited auons taking 
military actions in Iraq . 

San Francisco itself drew over 
50,000 people. all prntesting 
against "Gulf \Var II." 

''These rail ie. show tha t there i. 
a huge number of pl:ople ,1gainst lhi -
war," Stenlke said. "And thi; IS what 
policy m,lkers have to think about." 

The large number of demon-
strators worldwide felt it particu-
larly importa nt ro protest because 
many believe th at a new war with 
Iraq is immi nent. A rece nt Nrw 
Yod, Time.d"CBS News" po ll 
demonstrates that ove r 70 percent 
of Americans helieve that the 
U nited States wi ll be lighting 
agai nst Iraq in thc nca r future. 

And altho ugh these large nUI11-
bers nf protesters do indicate a 
large resentment toward a new 
war, the maj ority of Americans still 
encourage the United ations to 
take military action. 

The N tW York Timtr/"CBS 
News" poll also demonstrated that 
6 7 percent o f Americans believe 
that the United States should go to 
war with Iraq to end the reign of 
Saddam Hussein. 

Some UCSD students believe 
that these protests, though they 
unitcd thousa nds of peo ple in 
search of a common goal, did not 
accompl is h their objecti ve of 
increasing public support for the 
anuwar movement. 

"They onl y further their own 
propaganda," said undergrad 
attendee Shannon Stark. "They are 
not getting a core representation of 
what the public truly believes." 

Regardless of popular sentiment 
about the war, the forum attempted 
to prove why the war was unjust 
from a socialist point of view. 

Lance Newman, the last pre-
senter of the night, described the 
war effort as fi ghting a battle witll 
a wounded enemy. 

"After 10 years of blockade, 
Iraq doesn 't have pencils for 
schools, let alone nuclear 
weapons," he said . "Most of us 
here believe Bush is lying." 

Newman , a professor at Cal 
State San Marcos and a member of 
ISO, said that antiwar hostility has 
to reach the levels that once 
occurred during the Vietnam War 
protests of the I 960s. 

"We need to make the political 
cost of the war so high that [the 
U .S. government is] no longer 
willing to fight it," he said. "We 
need to fight like hell to stOp this 
war."

Review: UCSD denied 
admission to 24,000 in 2002 

Students share Silk Road travels 
Ambassadors of peace sought for 2003 trip 

continued from page I 
33,000 applicants this year, more 
than any university in the nation . 
UC Berkeley denied 28,000 and 
UCSD rejected 24,000 applicants. 

In accordance with the newly 
implemented comprehensive 
review method , the UC Board of 
Regents stopped requiring each 
campus to admit 50 to 75 percent 
of students based solely on grades 
and test scores. 

Comprehensive review, which 
was approved 15-4 by the UC 
Regents last year, was used when 
admitting the current freshman 
class. As part of the new process, 
instead of considering only SAT 
scores and grade point average, 
additional factors are considered. 

The new procedure is intended 
for applicants to be considered for 
admission based on a broad source 
of academic and personal experi-
ences and qualifications. 

"Our analysis found that acade-
mic achievement is still by far the 
predominant consideration in UC 
admissions and that access to UC 
has been maintained for students 
of all demographic backgrounds," 
said Barbara A. Sawrey, a chem-
istry professor at UCSD and chair 
of the Academic Senate's Board of 
Admissions and Relations with 
Schools, which authored the 
report. "We also expect that the 
process will be fine-tuned each 
year, and we have identified sever-
al issues for further study and dis-
cussion to facilitate that fine-tun-
ing." 

Critics of the current policy are 
concerned that some applicants 
embellish their records in order to 
be given an edge in UC admissions. 
UC Regent Ward Connerly raised 
concerns at a Sept. 19 meeting of 

the Board of Regents, citing sever-
al newspaper articles that ques-
tioned whether the comprehensive 
review process was being adminis-
tered fairly. He also questioned 
whether the policy was a way to 
bring race and ethnicity into the 
admissions process. This, Connerly 
said, would be a way to circumvent 
the California constitution. He 
suggested the university conduct an 
independent, outside audit of the 
policy. 

Responding to potential criti-
cism, twO pilot programs verified 
additional information in the 
application during the first year of 
comprehensive review, and a sys-
temwide verification process will 
begin in the fall 2003 admissions 
process to ensure the reliability of 
information on the application. 

"We want to be able to assure 
people that what we claim - that 
there is little to no falsification -
is the case," Sawrey said. "The 
only way to ensure the highest 
level of public confidence is 
through random verification." 

Two preliminary tests found 
that hardly any students lied on 
applications. Using a sample of 437 
applications, UCSD wanted to ver-
ify either the self-reported family 
income or the portion of the appli-
cation that lists honors, achieve-
ments and community service the 
student claimed. In the end, all but 
one applicant could provide docu-
mentation. 

"[Comprehensive review) has to 
do with economics and experiences, 
not races," said John Muir College 
sophomore Michelle Haft. 
"[Applicants] of lower status who 
aren't racial minorities are also taken 
into account. It's like a racially fair 
version of affinnative action." 

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Staff Writer 

Students and staff from "The 
Silk Road to the Future" program 
spoke about their experiences in 
China at a Nov. 22 presentation , 
informing interested students 
about the opportunity to embark 
on a weeklong trip to China as 
ambassadors of peace . 

Sponsored by the nonprofi t 
cultural organization Legends of 
China, the program will enable 
students to travel to various loca-
tions in Beijing, the country's cap-
ital, as well as other cities in China 
on the optional side trip. The 
organization, based in Los 
Angeles and Beijing, sends up to 
500 Anlerican students from dif-
ferent universities and 500 
Chinese students to visit places 
like the Forbidden City, the Great 
Wall, Tiananmen Square and sev-
eral Chinese universities. 

"I greatly recommend going 
on this journey to experience the 
dynamics of visi ring di fferent 
cities," said sophomore Achim 
Lyon. 

After Lyon and several staff 
members spoke, students were 
encouraged to ask questions about 
the aspects of the program. 
Participants in the program also 
presented pictures and a slide show. 

"I was curious about the trip," 
said Revelle College junior Amy 
Wei, a presentation attendee. "I 
have a more solid idea of the pro-
gram and am highly considering it." 

In addition to traveling to his-
torical sites in China, participants 
will be able to interact with 
Chinese students while they travel 
and learn about the culture. 

"It's one thing to learn about 
the history of a culture in the class-
room, but to actually talk to people 
who live [in China] is a completely 
different educational experience," 
said Melanie Horn, an assistant 
resident dean at El eanor Roosevelt 
College who traveled with the pro-
gram during the summer of 2002. 

In addition to traveling, acade-
mic programs and other cultural 
activities will also be held for the 
students. One activity includes 
designing silk panel s tim will be 
sewn together into a banner to be 
used at the opening ceremony of 
the 2008 Olympics that will be 
held in Beijing. The program also 
provides students the chance to 
look at historical statues, present-
day architecture of China, 
Buddhist temples, restaurants and 
various other sights of the co untry. 

"The trip is more like experi -
ential learning," said Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Educational Advancement Loren 
Thompson. "Learning takes place 
in the street level by observation 
and direct individual contact with 
Chinese people." 

Others also spoke about the 
importance of building relations 
with China through such pro-
grams as "The Silk Road to the 
Future." According to Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Ed Spriggs, China will probably 
be one of the most powerful coun-
tries in the future. Consequently, 
he said, it is important to build 
camaraderie between the United 
States and China, and become 
familiar with their society. 

"It's important to learn more 
about one of the great civiliutions 
in the globe so that we can look

fo rward to being partners in the 
future with greater under tand-
in g," Spriggs sa id. 

The total cost for the weeklong 
trip is $998 per smdent, which 
includes a round-trip ticket, hotel , 
meals, programs, transportation 
and other necessities. There is also 
an optional side trip that costs an 
additional $468 and includes 
exploring other Chinese cities. The 
extended trip will last 10 days, as 
opposed to seven for the main tour. 

Those who are interested in the 
program must turn in a registration 
fonn as soon as possible and place a 
Sioo deposit by April I. This date 
is still tentative and should be 
checked at http://7JfIJlW.ltgmdsofthi-
TlIJ.wm. Registration forms and fur-
ther infonnation can also be found 
at Student Center B 224-225.

languages 
Why is America a multicultural but monolingual society ? 

25 times more languages 
than w untri es in the world, 
it is safe to assume that mul -

tilingualism is a widespread phe-
nomenon. Ln fact, about one-fifth of 
UCSO's freshman class speaks a lan-
guage other than English at home. 
H owever, for much of the United 
States, monolingualism is extremely 
rampant, despite the country's rich 
cul tural and lingui stic diversity. 
Because of the global status which 
the English language has achieved, 
many people do not feel the need to 
learn another language. In addition, 
inuni grants are pressured to give up 
their native languages in favor of 
Engl ish so they can assimilate more 
easily. Oes pi te the fac t that the 
U nited Sta tes has no official lan-
guage, English is seen as a uni fying 
la nguage which holds all Americans 
together. 

Professor O lga Vasq uez of the 
communica t ions de partment is 
currently writing a book on the 
importance of bilingualism. She is 
quick to point Out the dangers of 
the emp has is on monolingualism. 

"In this global context, under 
th e conditio ns of t day, education 
focuses on monoculnlralism and 
Illonolingualislll," she said. "As a 
result, we are squanderi ng the 
resources of bilintrual chi ldren . To 
insist on monoc~ltura l islll means 
that we will hold hack the children 
who are only Engli h-speaking." 

In Vasq uez's class on bilingual 
communica tion , there are about 13 
languages spo ken among her 80 
snl dents . She believes trongly in 
m e importance of bil ingualism and 
the advantages it brings. 

"Kn owin g another language 
o pens up your mind to new poss i-
bilities, ways of understanding 
o ther perspec tives, sensibil ities and 

possibi lit ies," Vasquez said. 
To change a tti tudes towa rd 

bi lingual ism and languages, 
Vasquez feels that there needs to be 
more classes like her bilingual com-
munication class in which snJdents 
are exposed to the issue of lan-
gu age. She is saddened by the idea 
that some people feel that it is not a 
problem cilat immigrants and their 
chil dren lose their native tongues. 

"They haven't had the experience 
and understanding of what it is like 
to lose a language," Vasquez said. 

While some parents, especiall y 
immigrants, feel th at educati ng 
their children in more than one 

language has its benefits, its oppo-
nents have very strong feelings 
against it. upporters argue thar 
educating children in their native 
language keeps them from falling 
behind their peers while they are 
learning English . Those against it, 
however, claim that the practice 
will delay the mastery of English 
and result in a delay of their lea rn-
in g other su bjects as well. In 
Ca li fo rn ia, this was a major issue 
when Propositi on 227 was passed 
in 1998, which eli minated bil ingual 
education. T hose wh o voted in 
favor of the measure believed that 
bil inguali sm contributed to nega-

tive intellectual and emotional 
effects, includillg lack of self-confi-
dence, contempt toward parents 
and poor performance on intelli -
gence tests , 

Monolin gualism has Its conse-
quences not JUSt for mdividuals but 
society as a whole . The United 
Sta tes experienced some of the 
consequences of a shortage of for-
eign language translators in 
September of 2001. On ept. l a, 
u.s. Intell igence had intercepted 
messages in the Arabic language 
warni ng of an attack the next day, 
but they were not translated until 
Sept. 12. Such an occurrence illus-

trates the lack of foreign language 
competency in this country. 

While Am ericans may nut feel 
the need to be bi lingual, it is some-
thing that is important and almost 
natural for Illany Europeans and 
Canadians. In Canada, English and 
French are the two official lan-
guages, and they do not threaten 
each other because they both enjoy 
high prestige in the country. As a 
result, many people are proficient In 
both languages. In Europe, there is a 
great deal of close contact among 
various languages, making it neces-
sary to be able to speak at lea t two 
or three languages. The nitcd 
States, howevcr, is isolated. There i~ 
nor much intt:raction with other I.ln-
guages except at the border" with 
Spanish to the south and French to 
the north. EspeCIally In the IIl1ddl<! 
of the country, far from the borders, 
there is nothing to replenish the 
minority languages. vVithout an 
influx of immigran ts who could 
come in and refurbIsh the 1;III!fU;I!!C, 
people will tart to asslllldatc .lJ1d 
only speak English, the dt: facto offi -
cial language of the nllcd ~t,IlCS. 

Vasquez hopes thar pe()pl e wd l 
under,wnd the need to Icarll ,lI1oth -

Students accuse Costa Verde of mismanagement 
Ways protect yourself in rental agreements 

By SAM WILSON 
Contributing Writer 

Costa Verde Village Aparmlents 
is an extensive apartment complex 
located along La Jolla Village Drive. 
With hundreds of units and a conve-
nient location, it is a major source of 
off-campus - albeit relatively 
expensive - student housing. The 
securiry deposit, which is S 1,200 for 
a two-bedroom apartment with a 
loft, is relatively expensive as well. 
Since the Costa Verde units are new, 
it makes sense mat the owners would 
want to protect their investment, 
and so there is no reason for a renter 
to be suspicious of the deposit policy. 

However, instead of merely using 
the securiry deposit to protect the 
property against tenant damages and 
unreasonable messes, some UCSD 
students allege that Costa Verde 
management seems to embrace a 
rather cavalier policy of using the 
security deposit to generate income 
sometimes violating California 

rental law in the process. 
A security deposi t is not a pay-

ment, but rather money put forward 
by the tenant in case the renter fails 
to pay the rent, damage is done to 
the apartment or if the apartment 
needs to be cleaned. Barring any of 
these occurrences, it is the landlord's 
responsibi lity to renJrn the full 
deposit to the tenant. Civil Code 
1950.5.al limits damages to those 
"exclusive of ordinary wear and tear, 
caused by the tenant or by a guest or 
license of the tenant." 

Obviously, terms like "damage" 
and "reasonable" are up to interpre-
ration, but the California State Web 
site, http://1uW'w.dca.ca.govlkgallland-
Iordbooltlstc-dtpo.rir.hrm. gives advice 
for the application of these terms. 
For example, wear and tear on car-
pets and drapes could include "mod-
erate dirt or spotting," while large 
rips and stains justify a deposit 
deduction. Small dings or marks in 
the paint are also justified as normal 
wear and tear, but larger holes may 

need retouching. 
While the cost of repainting can 

be billed to a tenam in the case of 
damages, the amount that needs to 
be paid is proportional to the life-
time of the product. Hence, if a ten-
ant has lived in an apartment for one 
year, and it was newly painted at 
move-in, then he or she should only 
be charged half the cost of any 
repainting, according to the Web 
site. 

The standard for cleaning is that 
the apartment must be suitably clean 
for an "average" or "reasonable" ten-
ant to move into the apartment. "A 
landlord cannot automatica lly 
charge each tenant for cleaning car-
petS, drapes, wall , or windows in 
order to prepare the rental unit for 
the next tenancy," stated the Web 
site. Acceptable cleaning costs might 
include spraying for fleas , cleaning 
the oven or taking stickers off walls if 
these tasks remained unfinished .

senior, lived in a Costa Verde apart-

ment for one year, and paid his share 
of a $1,200 deposit. When he moved 
Out, the apartment was left, in his 
opinion, well-cleaned, with the only 
damages being two uncaulked holes

had been set into the wall. Costa

Costa Verde: Tenants 
charged for 'strange' repairs crossword 

continued from page I I 

$67 1. 4 3 of the money. Salas was 
charged for exrensive cleaning, 
repainting and ca rpet cleaning. 
When Salas complai ned of these 
charges, he believes he received fa lse 
claims from the management. 

"They said that the oven wasn't 
clean, but my roommate spent two 
hours scrubbing it," Salas said. " I 
cleaned the bathroom myself with 
Ajax, and they said it was dirty." 

Repainting was charged for the 
entire aparm1enr, even though only 
one bedroom was damaged, and that 
would have only required a touch-
up, according to Salas. 

S:llas eventually sued in small 
claims court to recover some of his 
deposit and $6(JO in damages, the 
maximum all owed in security 
depo it disputes. Since no photo 
had been taken be fo re and after 
moving, his claims hinged primari ly 
on statute 1950.5.3 f that sta tes that 
the landlords must deliver an "item-
ized starement indicating the basis 
for, and the amount of, any security 
received." Sala had simply been 
given a bill li sting the costs of paint-
ing, carpet cleani ng and genera l 
cleaning, with no further breakdown 
and no indication of the damages 
that justitied the costs. In addition, 
Sala~ charged that without uch a list 
of damages, the receipt evidenced 
that the managemcnt had charged 
him for routine deaning. 

Duri ng lhe lrial. Costa Verde's 
represe ntatlvt! produced an 
unsigned document ta ti ng thut 
tenants agree to pay for ca rper 
cleaning and repai nti ng when tht'y 
move o ut. Sala re:.ponded that not 
only had he not ~een it, hilt since ir 

wasn't signed, it was not binding. 
Fi nall y, he argued that even if it 
had been signed, it wou ld still not 
be binding because it stipulated 
responsibi lities outside those legal -
ly required of a tenant, and a docu-
ment signed in breach of law is not 
binding. 

Salas lost his case. 
Another Revelle senior, Jason 

Grosz, accompanied his girlfriend 
on a walkthrough. She was relocat-
ing from one unit in Costa Verde to 
another due to safety concerns. The 
walkthrough ended in a screaming 
match when Grosz made o bjections 
and the management's representa-
tive began yelling at him. 

The tenants were charged $60 
for painting, although the list pre-
sented simply said " retouching." 
Grosz also saw a pay sca le that said 
each hour of painting cOSt Costa 
Verde $20. When Grosz spoke to a 
Costa Verde pai nter, he reporredly 
responded that " touch-up painting 
wouldn't be charged by the hour -
more like a half-hour, or maybe 45 
minutes." M ,m y of these charge 
were later dropped at the insistence 
of the tenants, who exercised some 
leverage due to thei r sa fety con-
cerns and the fact that they were 
moving fTOm o ne unit to another. 

To avoid being overcharged for 
cleaning and damages at any apart-
ment complex, tenants should do a 
walkthrough when movi ng OLlt. 
They should take pictures at movc-
in and move-out to establish the 
preexisting state of the property,. 
There ;lrt! also a variety of instinl -
ti011S, such as the Bener BLlsines, 
Bureau, that are interested in bnd-
lord malfeasance and ~hould be 
notified .

Foundation: 
Students work 

alongside 
chancellor 

cominued from page 13 
around campus and is charged with 
the cask of selecting the UCSD 
senior class gift each year. This gifr 
is meant to make a positive change 
by teaching scholars the benefits of 
philanthropy. 

The spirit of philanthropy per-
meates the organization. 

.. All of what we are able to do is 
out of full support and encourage-
ment from many generous UCSD 
alumni who believe in our goals 
and who believe in us," UCSDSF 
President Melissa Tsang said. "As a 
trustee, I have grown more 
attached to my university and feel 
more encouraged to give back to 
UCSD after rea li zing all the 
opportunities that I have received 
as a student here." 

The Student Foundation con-
tributes to many pivotal UCSD 
events throughout the year, includ-
ing donating to the Chancellor's 
5K RunlWalk, which raises money 
for scholarships; running Change 
for Change, a drive that collects 
spare change for charity; and the 
instirution of many other gifts to 
help students around campus. 

Currently, the group is antici-
pating the creation of' the Wall of 
Student Excell ence and 
Philanthropy. a tribute to the 
achievements of UCSD and its 
organizations. The exhibit will be 
placed in the lobby of Price Center 
Theater and wili include a multi-
media display with several moni-
tors located throughout the Price 
Center. in which students will be 
ahle to showcase pe rsonal and 
organization achievements, as well 
as upcoming events for others in 
the UCSD community to see. 

"We feel that this will be a 
notable point in the evolution of the 
Price Center," Vice Chair of 
Communications Brandon Freeman 
said. "It will allow anyone with valu-
able information to convey it at no 
charge [Q the rest of the student pop-
ulace, and it will make the students at 
UCSD better aware of what goes on 
at the university and just what an 
amazing place UCSD really is." 

Aside from the obvious benefi ts 
gained from the cultivation of a 
philanthropic spirit, members say 
that Student Foundation partici-
pants benefit in many 
ways . Interested students have the 
opportuni ty to have a trustee of the -
UCSD Foundation as a mentor. 

"The UCSD Foundation 
trustees are some of the most 
prominent, successfuJ .and interest-
ing people from UCSD and the 
San Diego area," Freeman said. 

In addition, Student 
Foundation members enjoy a rela-

, . tionship with the administration 
th'lt InOH students lack. 

"As a trustee. I have had the priv-
ilege of working with prominent fig-
ures at our university, such as 
Chancellor [Robert C.] Dynes, Vice 
Chancel lor Dames] Langley and our 
generous alumni," Tsang said. 

Ready to join? Although the fall 
nominations drive has closed, 
information about the spring drive 
will be available at hctp:llwww.SlU-

guarding him. We had him guard -
ing at twO meters, and he 's not a 
defender," Harper sa id. "There's 
notlUng more nerve-racking than 
when the conference MVP has a 
shot like that." 

As the clock ran out, H3rper 
was dragged into the pool by hi s 
champion hip team, 

"The thing that was just so cool 
for me was see ing the kids," 
Harper said. "The game was over, 
now I'm in the water and I see how 
happy they arc and that's when it 
really hit that this is really neat." 

To get to the championship 
game on Nov. 23, UCSD had to 
beat both La Verne and the Air 
Force Academy on Nov. 22, 

Against La Verne, the top-seed -
ed Tritons won 9-4, First team AII-
WWPA selection C lark Peterson 
led the Tritons with three goals, 
followed by Travi s Boettner's two , 

In the' ni ghtcap against the 
Falcons of Air Force , fellow all-
conference sel ection Jonathan 
H opkins and Brandon Borso com-
bined for seven of UCSD's 10 
goa ls, and Onken pulled down 10 
saves in the 10-4 victory, 

On cham pionship Saturday, fi ve 
different Tri tons each scored o ne 
goal to secure UCSD's 13 th 
WWPA championship. 

With the win over LMU, 
UCSD is guaranteed a spot in the

Tritons open 2002--03 season 
Women's basketball losses first two games on road 

By ANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball team didn't kick 
off the sc::ason like it wanted to , The Tritons d ropped 
their first two games of the 2002-03 campaign in twO 
away matches against Montana State University-
Billings on Nov, 22 and Nov, 23, 

The first game, which the Yellowjackets won 75-
65, was typical of an early season contest. UCSD 
committed 17 turnovers, which was almost double 
the number of TritOn assists at nine. 

"We have a yo ung team, and I think it was just the 
youth and early season jitters that caused the 
turnovers," said UCSD head coac h Judy Malone. 

MSU-Billings also played a sloppy game, turning 
the ball over 19 times. However, the difference was the 
Yellowjackets' ability to hit shots, In the opening half, 
MSU-Billings shot 50 percent from the floor, wlUle 
UCSD converted on just 32 percent of its attempts, 
and the Yellowjackets rode a 41-30 lead into halftime. 

In the second half, the Tritons began to get more 
comfortable on the offensive end of the court, but 
MSU-Billings prevented UCSD from making any 
kind of run with its barrage of three-pointers, In the 
tlnal 20 minutes, the Yellowjackets hi t five of their 10 
attempts from lung distance, fini shing the game with 
seven three-point~rs, 

Also stopping tile Tritons from pi cking up any 
m omentum to make a comeback were MSU- Billings' 
two shot blockers, J essie Henigman and Rubyn 
Miline, both of whom linished in tht: top 20 in the 
nation last season for blocked shots, Heni gman had 
five rejections in the ga me and Miline had four, 

UCSD was led by junior guard Ali Ginn and 
sophomore center Margaret Johnson, Ginn had 12 
points on 5 - 12 shooting and tluee steals in the game, 
J o hnson , who hit just two of her 14 shot attempts, 
converted on all eight o f her free throws and fini shed 
the game with 12 points and nine rebounds, 

The second game between the two teams was 
played Out differently tllan the contest on Nov, 22, 
but the linal result was the salllC, with MSU -Billings 
coming out on top 62-57 . 

The Tritons' shooting percentage was again low 
at 32 percent for the gamc, bur UCSD took a 32 - 18 
lead after the first half because its defense held the 

Guororon file photo 
Stilileaming: The youthful Tritons couldn't hold onto an 
18-point lead against the more experienced Yeliowjackets, 
Yellowjackets to a Held-goal percentage of just 2 1 
percent in the tirst 20 minutes . 

After pushing their lead to 18 points with 17:56 
left in the second half, th e Tritons let MSU-Billings 
back into th e ga me, A threc- poi nter by the 
Yellowjackets' J oan Langford brought her tea m to 
within cight points with just over 12 minutes left, 
Then, at the 8:33 mark , a shot from Lisa Jellum of 
tVISU-Biliings tied the game at 47. 

T he teams exchanged baskets until the 
Yellowjackets took thc::ir first lead of the game, hitting 
twO free throws with under three minutes remaining. 
MSU-Billings never looked back after another field 
goal with 2:16 left , 

"We lost our composure at the end," M alo ne said, 
"We did self-destruct." 

UCSD was again led by Ginn and Johnson; Ginn 
had a double-double with 12 points and II rebounds. 
Johnson, who conti nued to get to the free- throw line, 
had 13 points and eight boards, 

"I'm not disappointed with our performance," 
Malone said. "Our kids played so well ," 

The Tritons will try to get thei r first win at Grand 
Canyon University o n Dec. 7 before the UCSD pla ys 
its hom e opener against GCU on Dec. 14,

"It's really special," Harper said .

already given out the workout 
schedule and I'm already thinking 
about what the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association match-ups

the middle and keeping the Tritons

"The way it turned out was real-

faster than we did," McFarland said . 

UCS D showed its resiliency in 
game two, batt ling hack for a 30-27 
win, On offense, the Tritons' usual-

dependent on Bonnie Wil son , who 
put down 21 kill s in the match -
more than a third of UCSD's total. 

On the other side of the net, the 
Coyotes were able to use variety to 
better effect, wi th four players in 
double fi gures fo r kills to subdue 
the Tritons 30-24 and 30-23 in tile 
final two games. 

Morohunfola led tile way with a

UCSD's 
water polo 
program 

turns heads 

o Knows 
Owen Main 
he UCSD men's water polo 
team won its 13th Western 
Water Polo Association 

conference championship on Nov. 
23, securing a spot in the NCAA 
tournament in two weeks. For head 
coach Denny Harper, who's been 
the coach of all 13 of those teams, 
thIS should be old hat by now, right? 

"There was a time in my coach-
ing career when I was fired up to 
win these things and it was all about 
me, but now it's just all about 
them," Harper said . "I can't be any 
more proud of how hard they 
pl ayed." 

When the team tried to get him 
into the pool, Harper tried to fight 
it, looking for something to grab on 
to - just like he always does. All he 
found was senior captain Bryon 
Spicer who, despite Harper's best 
efforts , got the coach in the water. 

"I'm not going to make it easy 
[to get me in the pool], " the coach 
said. "I never make it easy. I think 
my record is two minutes holding 
onto a bar." 

However, Harper's record of 
two minutes isn 't the most amazing 
thing about UCSD men's water 
polo. In a school that has only 
recently moved to Division II and 
still doesn't give scholarships to 
athletes , Harper has been able to 
maintain a program that consis-
tently competes on a national level 
with Division I chools, unlike any 
other sport at UCSD. 

Not only do his teams compete, 
but, with the help of the many play-
ers he's coached, Harper has made 
it almost standard for UCSD to 
beat Division I schools. 

In 2000, the Tritons upset USC 
in the national semi-fi nal game 
before losing to UCLA in the 
finals. 

That rear, Harper won the 
National Coach of the Year award, 
and with his 13th WWPA confer-
ence title this season, Harper col-
lected his 14th Coach of the Year 
award in the WWPA. 

Despite his wealth of experience 
and credentials, the coach wasn't 
afraid to fiddle with his team and 
try something new. This season, 
Harper adjusted to his team's youth 
and depth, using an unprecedented 
substitution pattern. Subbing two 
whole squads of six in and out of 
the game and giving 12 players sig-
nificant playing time each game, 
UCSD wore down many bigger 
and stronger opponents. 

With no scholarships to offer 
and high academic standards, 
coaches at UCSD may find it diffi -
cult to entice some top-level ath-
letes to come here. 

But with its program's success 
and consistency agai nst such a high 
level of competi tion, UCSD men's 
water polo seems to make a name 
for itself nationally and turn the 
heads of some top recruits almost 
every year. 

For all but five UCSD players, 
Nov. 2J marked their first confer-
ence championship. In front of 
almost 1.500 spectators, they cele-

"We want to make it to the 
finals and beat LMU," said Triton 
men's water polo team's Kellan 
Hori before last weekend 's 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships at UCSD. 

Hori got his wish on Nov. 2J 
when the Tritons edged Loyola 
Marymount University 5-4 in 
front of 1,456 fans at Canyonview 
Pool. T he win gave UCSD its 
13th conference title and earned 
the Tritons an automatic berth in 
the 2002 ational Collegiate 
Athl etic Association 
Cham pionships, which will be 
held at LMU. 

Last year, UCS D 's season 
ended in the Lions ' pool in the 
WWPA championship game.

this game all year," said senior 
goalkeeper Lance Onken, who

honors while stoppiJ,lg seven 
Lions shots and giving up just

year, I've wanted to beat LMU at 
our pool and go to play NCAA's 
at their pool." 

The win over LMU was the 
Tritons' third this season without 
a loss. Hori, who earned A11-
Conference Honorable Mention, 
was confident after the game. 

"They ca n't beat us at our 
pool," Hori said. "We didn 't lose a 

game in conference all year. T hey 
can't beat liS here; we have the best 
crowd support."

Tritons fall to host CSUSB in semi-final match 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

There was no charm the 
third time around for the UCSD 
women'!; volleyball team when it 
fell short again to Cal State San 
Bernardino - this time in the 
semifinal match of the western 
regional to end its season with a 
26-5 record. BYU Hawaii 
defeated CSUSB in the final. 

UCSD entered the tourna-
ment as the fourth seed after fin-
ishing second in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
to CSUSB, the No. I seed. The 
Tritons opened play in the six-
team tournament Nov. 21 
against fifth-seeded Chaminade 
University of H awaii . 

Despite UCSD head coach 
Duncan McFarland's initial 
concerns about overlooking the 
Silverswords, UCSD came out 
quickly and dominated in three 
games (30-19,30-23,30-17). 

"I thought we were really 
focused," he said. "Before that 
match, I thought we might have 
some trouble looking beyond 
Chaminade." 

T he Wilson sisters, Jennie 
and Bonnie, led the Tritons, 
combining for 22 kills and 17 
digs. Setter Teresa Ohta con-
trolled the offense with 29 kills 
and contributed on defense with 
15 digs. Despite the closeness in 
seeding, UCS D felt no signifi-
cant pressure from Chaminade 
in its dominating victory. 

"We probably could have 
beaten them worse," Jennie 
Wilson said. 

The task the following night 
proved much more difficult; the 
Tritons drew the host Coyotes 
of CSUSB. In their two earlier 
contests this season, the
