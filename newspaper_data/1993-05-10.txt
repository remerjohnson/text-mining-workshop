SANTA BARBARA - UC 
Santa Barbara Chancellor 
Barbara Uehling announced her 
decision to resign her post last 
Thursday after six years as 
chancellor. In an open letter to 
the campus community, 
Uehling expressed her gratitude 
to UC President Jack Peltason 
and the UCSB community. 
Citing "rumors circulating 
about her future plans" and 
"questions about leadership 
continuity," Uehling will 
remain as UCSB Chancellor no 
longer than the 1993-94 
academic year, delaying her 
resignation in light of present 
fiscal difficulties. 

UCLA Will Lose 
VJce.ClumcelIor 
LOS ANGELES - UCLA's 
senior academic affairs vice 
chancellor Richard Sisson will 
return to his alma mater, Ohio 
State University, to become its 
vice-president for Academic 
Affairs and Ptovost starting 
Aug I. Sisson's decision to 
leave his job at UCLA for the 
position at Ohio might mean 
big organizational changes in 
the administration, according to 
UCLA officials. They will 
either reshuffle current staff 
members or search for a 
replacement. Sisson carne to 
UCLA in 1968 as a Political 
Science professor and was 
appointed his present position 
in 1991. 

UCR Election Draws

turnout of 1,721 students, the 
field of33 candidates was 
narrowed down to 20 people 
who will serve on the 1993-94 
UCR Senate. "My goal was 20

Legislation Proposes UC Tuition 
BUDGET: Bill would abandon the 
Master Plan for Higher Education, 
have students pay for instruction 
By Jonna Palmer 
Staff Writer 

Legislation which would allow the state to 
charge UCand CalifomiaState University (CSU) 
students tuition will be reintroduced to the Cali-
fornia State Senate later this month. 

Senate Bill (SB) 1072, authored by Senator 
Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), would make funda-
mental changes to the California Master Plan for 
Higher Education, the guidelines for all Califor-
nia colleges and universities since 1960, by 
charging students JI percentage of the cost of 
their education. 

Currently, the Master Plan stipulates that 
California residents may not be charged fees 
that are used to cover instructional COSts. 

The bill would also make significant changes 
to the Cal Grant program. It would combine 
grant programs administered by the Student Aid 
Commission (SAC) into a single administrative 
body, the California Grants Program. The grant 

money would then be distributed directly to the 
individual campuses of the UC and CSU sys-
tems, who would administer the program. 

In addition, the bill would allow students to 
receive aid longer than the current four-year 
limit and would make the grants available to 
both graduate and undergraduate students. 

Karen Staph-W a1ters,legislative aide to Sena-
tor Killea, said the bill would make the UC 
Regents more accountable to the Legislature 
and more responsible for implementing cost-
saving measures. 

"We are charging tuition now," Staph-
Walters said. "We have t9 look at what the 
reality is ... and go forward from there." 

She added that enrollment will be cut at UC 
and CSU campuses if some type of policy 
change is not made soon. 

"We can't raise fees by 20 percent [every 
year] forever," she said. 

However, critics contend that the bill would 
signal that the state has abandoned the ideal of 
an affordable education for all citizens. 

"The worst thing we see in the bill is [that] it

Weak Affirmative Action Policy Found 
By Dan Krauss 
Senior Staff Writer 

An internal task force created tQ review the 
effectivenessofUCSD's affirmative action pro-
cedures for university employees found racial 
discrimination in hiring and promotion despite 
strong university guidelines against such prac-
tices. The task force's report was submitted to 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson last month. 

The task force was formed following several 
complaints of racial discrimination at the UCSD 
Medical Center last year, but according to Di-
rector of Staff Affirmative Action (SAA) Delia 
Talamantez, a member of the 13-person task 
force, the study was not an investigation of 
individual complaints, but rdther a general re-
view of the university's affirmative action pro-
cedures. 

She added that the goal of the task force was 

to investigate the effectiveness of these anti-
discriminatory procedures, identify issues of ' 
concern and make recommendations to the chan-
cellor. 

According to Talamantez, the task force 
concluded that current policies regarding dis-
crimination need to be strengthened and en-
forced. 

"The procedures that we have in place, while 
they appear very good, in practice aren't effec-
tive," she said. 

Talamantez said that in her own experience, 
SAA often did not have the authority to make 
the necessary changes to improve conditions for 
minority employees. 

''The policies weren't empowered to make 
change," she said. "Things were in effect but 
they weren't working."

DCB Case 
Dismissed 
By Court 
GOVERNMENT: Judge fmds that 
UeB was only an "advisory" 
board. Federal case may be filed 
By Chris Jensen 
Associate News Editor 

A San Diego County Superior Court may 
have pounded the last nail into the coffin of the 
disestablished University Center Board (UCB) 
when it upheld a motion by administration 
attorneys to dismiss former ues Chair Chris 
Burnett's lawsuit against the UC Regents last 
Friday. 

Burnett and the UCB filed suit against the 
UC Regents and members of the UCSD admin-
istration last November in an attempt to secure 
funding for independent legal counsel andcJarify 
the board's relationship with the university. [n 
the case, the board argued that it should have 
auority to issue space agreements to the co-ops 
and other student organizations and hold control 
over money raised by self-assessed fees. 

The legal action led Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph Watson to "disestablish" 
the uca in February, arguing thatthe board was 
an advisory body that had no right to sue the 
university_ Burnett continued with the suit after 
Watson disbanded the board. 

In his ruling, Judge Wayne Peterson sup-
ported the university's claims to control overthe 
board. 

"I don't believe that the University Center 
Board came to establish itself as anything other 
than an advisory board," he said. "I believe the 
university has the ability to disband the organi-
zation, as it created it." 

UCSD Director of Judicial Affairs Nick 
Aguilar, who represented the regents along with 
Jennifer Kelly, said that "it is unusual for a court 
to grant a Motion for Summary Judgement," the 
motion that Peterson approved last Friday. "It is 
only granted when it's clear to the court thatthe 
complaint has no merit," he said. 

Graduate Student Association (GSA) Presi-
dent Patrick Carroll, who was present at the 
hearing, said he did not think the UCB got 
justice from Peterson's ruling, comparing the

CMRR Fuels Computer Revolution 
RESEARCH: Magnetic 
recording center 
celebrates tenth birthday 
By ErIc SchmIdt 
Senior Staff Writer 

Professor of Physics Sheldon 
Schultz laughs when asked if com-
puter memory storage will get five 
times better in the next 15 years, 
matching the rate of improvement 
that has occurred in the last 15 years. 

"The project now is to get 100 
times more storage density by the 
year 2000," said Schultz, who di-
rects UCSD's Center for Magnetic 
Recording Research (CMRR). 

Such an incredible increase in 
hard disk efficiency has profound 
implications for the computer world. 
Book-sized hard disk drives con-
taining 250 megabytes of informa-
tion will soon fit in pocket calcula-
tors. Laptop computers with 10,000 
megabytes ofstorage seem possible. 

And the advances in magnetic 
storage proposed for the near future 
in no way overshadow the leaps of 
the past. A 1983 mM disk drive the 
size of a microwave oven is now as 
small as a ham sandwich. 

The two disk drives were show-
cased at a Tuesday seminar, entitled 
"Magnetic Storage Manufacturing 
by the year 2000," which marked 
CMRR's 10th anniversary. 

In the ten years CMRR has been 
an operating research center, the 
technological advances in magnetic 
storage have been astounding, but 
don't look for too many concrete 
contributions from the group. The 
main purposes of the CMRR fac-

David CIIOI Gu!fan 
Lou Shrlnkel from Conner PerIpherals shows an advanced hard drive. 

ulty are to train students and to con-
duct basic research which can later 
be applied by corporations. 

Schultz holds a 40 megabyte hard 
drive that easily fits in the palm of 
his hand and motions toward the 
bulky 40 megabyte drive in his own 
Macintosh Classic, just a few years 
old. Some of the theoretical work 
behind the tiny drive was performed 
at CMRR laboratories years ago. 

"We tend to work on stuff that 
won't be a product for quite a few 
years," Schultz said. As an example, 
he cited the work of Professor of 
Engineering Neal Benram, who 
found that altering the composition 
of a disk in certain ways would 
improve the disk's capacity. 

"Professor Benram and his stu-
dents showed how you could change 

the medium and improve disk den-
sity. He was acknowledged by mM 
for his contributions," Schultz said. 

Other imponant CMRR projects 
involve the search for more effi-
cient reading of disks. A hard disk 
contains a compact disc-like mag-
netic wheel which rotates under an 
electric ann that looks like a record 
player needle. 

The disks rotate on ball bearings, 
but such simple technology actually 
controls the amount of information 
which can be stored on the disks. 
"That ball bearing is a major limit in 
disk density, since if the disk runs 
crooked, the [electronic ann] will 
jump track," Schultz said. 

A ball bearing must aHow the 
disk to run more smoothly as data

The Unirersi1y if California is in real 
trouble; and the feasible sohdions are 
neither quick, easy nor Ji.entifol 

By Philip Michaels 
Opinion Edilor 

It came to me last night in a sudden flash of understanding, an instantaneous moment of enlightenment - the University of California has become the NBC of higher 
education. Like the much-maligned third-

place network, the UC system is losing money 
hand over fist. An embarrassing series of public 
relations blunders has diminished the 
university's reputation. And as if that weren't 
enough, our most talented faculry are fleeing for 
greener pastures. How long before Conan 
O'Brian is named chancellor ofUC Riverside? 

After three years of hearing about how the 
University of California is on the fiery road to 
annihilation, it 's easy to listen to each budget 
horror story with casual indifference, shrug our 
shoulders and goon about our business. They're 
raising fees again? Ho-hum. Some faculty 
members are retiring early? Gee, that's too 
bad. The Architecture School is closing? 
Ten me something I don't already know. 

We've all heard the analogies about the """III:~C~!iM~' 
university's precarious situation, so much so 
that it 's begun to border on the ridiculous. 
Student fees have gone up a gazillion percent in 
the past two years! Class sizes have skyrocketed 
to a million students per lecture! By 1996, fees 
will be $40,000 per quarter! But don't dismiSS 
the latest news as hyperbole - the UC system 
is on the ropes, and a miracle cure won't be 
coming anytime soon. 

Anyone foolhardy enough to doubt the seri-
ousness of the situation only had to look at last

week's Guardian in or-
der to get a rude awak-
ening. The news last 
week was grim - the 
UCsystem faces another 
$200 million cut in fund-
ing next year, in addi-
tion to the $135 million 
cut that's already been 
proposed. 

Here at UCSD, a 
joint Academic Senate 
and administration task 
force unveiled plans for 
budget cuts ranging 
from six to I 5 percent. 
This means the elimina-
tion of hundreds oflow-
enrollment classes and 
more than 70 teaching 
positions. The UCSD 
School of Architecture 
will be suspended and 
will probably wind up 
going the way of the di-
nosaur in a few years. 
The same can be said of 
several departments in 

the Graduate School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies (lR/PS). The Physical Edu-
cation Depanment is history, and several other 
departments will be scaled back. 

"We are in very serious trouble," Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson told those in attendance at 
last week's state-of-the-campus address. 
As if a public appearance by the chancel-
lor isn't chilling enough, his message 
was positively horrific. Chancel-
lors are usually the people 
who walk about with broad • 
grin on their faces, putting the 
best public relations spin on the worst of events 
and generally trying not to alarm the university 
community. When someone like Atkinson is

By El~' Rabani 
Sta.D' lr'rile, 

T he ides of May are once again upon us, bringing with them the seasonal fiscal massacre which is by now a three-year tradition. In rccent weeks, 
it was revealed that UCSD would 

face a nine percent cut in its total budget. Sadly. 
that's the optimistic story. Most reasonable 
observers expect that the May revise will bring 
a shortfall of over$12 billion in the state budget. 
That's $4 billion more than Governor Pete "Just 
Tuning-Up the State" Wilson's January budget 
proposal projected. 
Let's just say that 
Pete has a habit of 
trying to surprise 
people with the 
worst, even if the 
facts of the matter 
have long been ob-
vious. 

The nine percent 
cut,or $24 million, is 
based on a projected 
cuttothe UC of$135 
million (really over 
$200 million with 
some slick account-
ing). Now the UC 
faces allother $200 
million in cuts be-
yond that. 

Chancellor 
Atkinson has it right 
when he says that 
"the state of Calif or-
nia has walked away 
from supporting the 
University of Cali-
fornia," or at least,

scarier than you 
think. 

mostly right. We must not forget that the state of 
California is not the same as the people of the 
state. The plight of the UC, or even public 
educa\ion in general, hasn't fully registered yet. 

Once again, we have before us an instance of 
a frog in boiling water. If the water is initially 
cool and the temperature is raised gradually, the 
frog will be boiled before noticing the heat. If 
the last several years of cuts had not been 
distributed more or less equally across the sys-
tem (not a bad thing), matters might look quite 
different. Had elliS been absorbed by eliminol-
ing campuses,lhe UC wOllld now be afive. or 
perhaps even fOllr campus system -fee hikes 
included. Had that strategy been chosen, there 
would have been far more outrage as the with-
drawal of contributions that the UC malees to 
communities and to the state became obvious. 

But then, it would be so difficult to build new 
showcase buildings. The Union-rriblllzerecently 
reponed that $35 million in state bonds have 
been sold to fund the construction of new build-
ings right here at UCS D. Hmm. Someone must 
be thinking that if we just build more buildings 
while students, faculty and staff are eliminated, 
maybe, just maybe, no one will notice that 
anything's wrong. This isn 't to say that the 

buildings are useless, but that there's long-
term capital investment being made when 

it's not really clear that there is much 
of a long-term. 

So far, it has been announced 
that the School of Archi-

-. tccture will be suspended 
or eliminated, the Graduate 

School of International Relations and Pa-
cific Studies downsized. the Quantitative Eco-
nomics program closed and the Psychology 
major restructured.

BUDGET: The 
DC system still finds 
itself on the ropes 
ContInued from pap 4 
time to empty the savings account and 
flee the state. 

Andasifthenewscouldn'tgetany 
worse, it appears as if the nine UC 
campuses are beginning to break 
ranks. At UC Berkeley, administra-
tors are pressuring the regents to give 
preferential t:reannent to their campus 
because, as UCB Vice a.aneellor 
John Heilbron said, Berkeley is more 
prestigious than the other UC schools. 
By UCB's logic, since it is the flag-
ship school and its basketball team 
advanced to the NCAA tournament, it 
should be treated to fewer budget cuts 
and a modified early retirement pro-
gram. UCB Chancellor Chang-Lin 
Tien has allegedly threatened to re-
sign unless the regents ease up on his 
school (Tienhas deniedtheserumors). 
The mono of the UC system is no 
longer "Let There Be Light" appar-
ently - the new slogan seems to be 
"Every Man For Himself." 

The Berkeley J-roposal is idiotic, 
of course. Giving preferential treat-
ment to a single campus because it's 
"special," as Daily Californian editor 
Virginia Matzek claims, goes against 
the idea of having a public universiry 
system. 

This distasteful proposal also sug-

gests the Berkeley administrators, fac-
ulry and students should make every 
effon to keep theiranogance in check. 
UC Berkeley has long since been 
surpassed or equaled as a universiry 
by Los Angeles, Davis and, yes, even 
us plebeians at San Diego. Thecil)' of 
Berkeley itself is an urban hellhole 
that should have been shut down by 
the Department of Health years ago. 
In short, Berkeley should cease and 
desist with its self-centered whining 
and prepare to take its lumps like the 
rest of us. 

So after all the budget cuts, depart-
ment closures, faculty departures and 
sniveling from our Berkeley cohorts, 
wberedoes that leave the UC system? 
Unfortunately, in the same dumpster 
we found ourselves before. The most 
depressing fact of this ongoing bud-
get crisis is that there's no solution in 
sight, and the people in charge are as 
equally dumbstruck as you and I. 
When he visited UCSD in February, 
UC President Jack Peltason could 
give no indication of when (or how) 
things would brighten up. Adminis-
trators at UCSD are so immersed in 
dealing with the short-term ramifica-
tionsofthe UCbudget that any thought 
of the long run probably makes their 
heads spin and their palms sweat. 

Solutions are few and far between. 
Certainly, quick-fixes and panaceas 
are completely non existent. To 
weather this particular tempest, the 
university is going to have to take cuts

Aaa .. r ......

Will 
According to University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA) Executive Director Andy 
Shaw, Governor Pete Wilson's 
onglnal budget proposal could 
leave the state with a several 
billion dollar deficit which could 
mean more budget cuts for the 
University of California. Shaw 
predicts two scenarios: 
• Icl...to A: This assumes 
that no additional funding will 
appear in the state budget. It will 
lead to a cut of $200 million 
from the UC budget, in addition 
to the $135 million that Wilson 
originally proposed. 
•• unlrlo I: This assumes 
that the temporary half-cent 
sales tax, scheduled to expire in 
January, 1994, would be 
continued for the next year. It will 
lead to only an additional cut of 
$60 million to the UC budget. 

-A.1CIIIco DeY"" 

across the board if it wants to continue 
to provide a low-cost, high'<luality 
education to the top students in this 
state. In the short run, these cuts are 
going to hurt badly, but unfortunately, 
they may be the only way, short of 
privatization, to keep the university 
afloat. Here are a few obvious sug-
gestions: 

• The Pete Wilson' Conundrum: 
After throe years of Wilson running 
amuck in the Capitol, it's clear that he 
should be voted out of office at the 
voters' earliest convenience, if not for 
the good of higher education, then for 
the good of tile entire state. In each of 
his budgets, Wilson has treated the 
UC and California State Universiry 
systems with the same affection nor-
mally reserved for root canals. 

But if only the problem began and 
ended with Wilson. The sad fact is 
that the state of California has no 
money. According to Peltason, the 
main message from the state legisla-
ture is "'we're sorry, we don't have 
enough money to give you,' not that 
'we don't want to give it to you .... 

• New Sources of Revenue: Since 
the legislature is either unable or un-
willing to finance the UC system like 
it did back in the good old days, the 
OffICe of the PJesident and the re-
gents need to start searching for new 
sources of revenue. The proposed UC 
corporation would be a nice addition, 
though early indications seem to sug-
gest that any revenue generated would 
simply be pumped back into research. 
Peltason must also consider seeking 
outside funding from private citizens 
or corporations - nothing as drastic 
as General Motors/Peterson Hall or 
mM Presents the Biology Depart-
ment, but certainly some I)'pe of pri-
vate sponsorship. 

• AdministrativeCuts: The Guard-

OPINION 5 

ian editorial board has been calling 
forcuts in administrative WIlSlC for so 
long that it's beginning to sound like 
a broken record. UC Berkeley Phys-
ics Professor Emeritus Charles 
Schwartz has issued report after re-
port detailing the millions of dollars 
that are wasted each year by the uni-
versiry administration. Even Peltason 
acknowledged the need to restructure 
the administrative process, although 
he gave no indication of specific cuts. 

QuUe simply, the universiry will 
not survive without cutting down on 
bureaucratic waste or eliminating 
needless positions. Realislically, this 
is an unlikely solution. The adminis-
trators who formulate the UC budget 
probably won't be willing to throw 
their own to the wolves. And even if 
they did - even if every needless 
administrator were summarily ex-
ecuted at dawn - it still would only 
make a dent in the budget shortfall. 

·FoeHikesandFaculryCuts:Shar-
ing the pain means everyone has to 
take a hit, including students and fae-
ulry. But the regents cannot continue 
to gouge students and faculry as they 
have in the past. Any fee hikes, any 
salary cuts and any department slash-
ing can only be considered short-term 
or temporary solutions. Faculry and 
students are what make it possible for 
the Universiry of California to exist. 
Keep balancing the budget on their 
backs, and the universiry is likely to 
lose its most valuable resource . 

GUARDIAN MUST MAKE AMENDS FOR ABORTION INSERT 
Editor: 

Last Monday, we were very dis-
turbed to see appear in your newspa-
per an eight-page full-color insert 
advocating restrictions on women's 
reproductive rights. We do not ques-
tion your right to accept such adver-
tisements, but we do question your 
judgement in choosing to do so. 

The issue of reproductive choice 
is a very serious matter. Prior to the 
1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. 
Wode, thousands of women died each 
year due to illegal abortions. In ac-
cepting $4,000 from groups advocat-
ing a reversal of Roev. Wade, you are 
implicitly endorsing a position that 
we believe the great majoriry of the 
UCSD community fmds morally re-
pugnant The notice stating that the 
eight-page section was an advertise-
ment was in extremely small type, 
making it possible for some readers to 
not even suspect that it was a paid 
advertisement. 

We demand that the Guardian 
make amends for this gross error of 
judgement As you know, groupsseelt-
ing to roll back R~ v. Wade are 
endowed with much greater resources 
than those supporting awoman's right 

, to choose. To demonstrate that the 
views expressed in the advertisement 
do not reflect the views of the Guard-
ian staff, we believe that the Guard-
ian should donate the entire $4,000 
that it received for printing the ad to 
Womancare, a San Diego women's 
center that is independently owned 
and operated and which has operated 
in the San Diego area for well over a 
decade. 

Indeed, as you may be aware, 
Womancare has been the target of 
anti-abortion activists, including per-
haps those who fmanced the adver-
tisement you ran. We can think of no 
better way of making amends than by

How can one take student govem-
ment seriously when the universiry 
officials show such disdain for demo-
cratic process? When the UCB didn't 
go the way the administration wanted, 
what did the administration do? It just 
turned around and said that the UCB 
doesn't exist any more. 

Why should anyone get involved 
in student government (or campus 
affairs, in general) ifthat1s the offICial 
attitude? 

In addition to the outrageous and 
. illegal squashing of the UCB, the 
administration has routinely harassed 
students active in campus causes. Ask 
Ouis Burnett about his experiences. 

In these days when there is atten-
tion paid to endangered coastal spe-
cies, we need a campus preservation 
act to save the endangered civic-
minded individuals who have created . 
a haven of student life and culture in 
the co-op student center and the ~ 
Cafe!. 

There has been a continuous at-
tack on the hard-working and dedi-
cated YO\lng people who have sus-
tained the student co-ops. These indi-
viduals have been almost continu-

ously harassed, questioned about ev-
erything from co-op business prac-
tices (has anyone checked out the 
business practices of the Price Center 
Book Store?)toc<H>phygiene (which

ElyRabani'sspiritedcornmentary 
("Correspondence FromaMulti-front 
War," May 3) was a wonderful sum-
mary of all the mistakes made by the 
multicultural movement He calls, at 
one point, for the reconstruction of 
cultures which have been destroyed 
and the "essential" task of reestab-
lishing certain cultural ~tit~. To 
recreate an historical identiry is to 
engage in multiculturaliSlS' favorite 
pastime: inventing historical fICtion. 
Afrocentrism - what is "Africa?" It 
is a creation of late twentieth-century 
afrocentrists. 

Imperialists consolidated sub-Sa-
haran Africa's tribal holdings into at 
least 30difi'ercnlcountrics (the names 
and numbers vary), which are very 
disunited. There is no "African" cul-
ture. In America, of course, black 
families have no ancestral memories 
of Africa. So they were "robbed of 
their culture." Well, the fU'st genera-
tion was robbed, but the succeeding 
generations have been new people. 
Why be burdened by history, chasing 

ghosts of a mythical Africa because 
years of racism has left academics 
feeling dispossessed? 

I am mostly of German descent 
(mostly, in American terms, means 
around 30 percent, if calculated gen-
erously over throe centuries), but if I 
go to Germany and try to feel Ger-
man,I am clearly engaged in histori-
cal fantasizing. If I grab a pretzel, a 
liter stein of Beck' s, and tum out for 
the Oktoberfest wearing lederhosen, 
[ am playacting. Could I become 
French by sipping old wine, eating 
smelly cheese and wearing a beanie? 
What if I discover that grandma was 
lying and that I'm really 100 percent 
Serb -do I require an identiry crisis? 
So it is with Americans of any sldn 
color; an "identity" is not some 
cobbled-together pack of myths and 
lies which adheres to genetic type, but 
rather it comes from each individual's 
real life experiences. 

Rabani's mention of''white privi-
lege" becomes the excuse for the 
whole nauseating exercise laid out 
above. I have been informed that my 
skin color makes me inherendy inca-
pable of grasping the concept, but I 
have two remarks to make. FU'stofall, 
privilege comes from money, not skin 
color. I try to console myself when 
things go wrong, that I. being white, 
am part of the "establishment" and 
therefore have "power," and I fre-
quently look around for people I can 
oppress (so I can feel better) but it 
doesn't wortc. Sony to burst a bubble. 
Second, all universiry students (espe-
cially at this prestigious universiry) 
are privileged bourgeoisie. Period. 

1 only agree with Rabeni on this 
one point, that it is bizarre for Gregory 
Stephens to try 10 point out that the 
Irish and Slavs were oppressed, too. 1 
haven't seen your passpon, Mr. 
Stephens, but I don't think you're 
Irish. And the Irish, for that matter, 
who seem determined to blow up 
London and wreak revenge on the 
British for not letting them massacre 
Irish Protestants in Belfast, can quit 
their w~ining.

PETE: Welcome 
to Governor WIlson's 
banana republic 
ContInued flam .... 4 

The joint Academic Senate-Ad-
ministration Task Force on the bud-
get (which does not directly consult 
with students) has rqIOncd thai the 
nine percent level of cuts would have 
a devastating effect on most under-
graduate programs. Again, that's 
based on the optimistic story. Fees 
rise as quality dies. 

It's unclear whether the UC will 
ever be able to return to the \evd of 
quality taken for granted only a few . 
years ago. Looking further ahead. 
things gel uglier: 1ecturer and tenured 
faculty layoffs, pay cuts for everyone 
left on the payroll and more fee hikes 
for students. One proposaI before the 
Legislature would compel the univer-
sity to impose tuition and probably 
charge grad students more than 
undergrads. 

In a recent issue of UCSD Tim~s, 
Tom Kuzmic, a senior accountant at 
the UCSD School of Medicine, dis-
passionately asked, "Should the UC 
be a private university?" Based on 
some sober, if a1anning, projections 
of the current disastrous course in 
state budgeting, the UC can expect 
from SO.2 to $2.6 billion from the 
state in 2001-2 to meet its projected 
needs of $3.6 billion. This is, we are 
told, the "handwriting on the wall" 
that argues for privatization. 

Privatization is an admittedly ab-
stract word that I and others have used 
frequently in reference to the present 
course of the university, but Mr. 
Kuzmic gives a striking description: 
"H UC became a private university, 
every student would be charged tu-
ition comparable to that charged at 
Stanford, for example. The 1993-94 
tuition at Stanford will be $17, nL . 
[and UC] tuition in 2001-2 would be 
around $30,000 ... An obvious ques-
tion is, where would students get 
S30,OOOper year to attend the Univer-
sity of California? We may have to 
consult with Stanford students for the 
answer to that question. " 

Without intending to hold this in-
triguing line of questioning against 
Mr. Kuzmic, I think it fair to point out 
that the popUlations that the UC has 
historically served are by definition 

left oul of thai equation. And as usual, 
economic impact is dispropoltionate 
across race and ethnicity. 

The "reality" school of thought 
obscures the very political moves that 
are being made. "How to privatize" 
will soon become the question replac-
ing "how to restore the state's com-
mitment to public education." The 
latter is basically off the table, with 
these changes being characterized as 
"inevitable." But any inevitability in 
this depends on the university com-
munity as well as all of the interests in 
California thai benefit from basic and 
higher education rolling over. 

So far, divide and conquer tactics 
have worted rather wdl, with public 
universitiesandcoIkgesgoingapinst 
K-12 and Berkeley (or at least Chan-
cellor Tien) against the rest of the 
ues for preferential treabnent. But 
when we are at each others' throats, 
we ignore basic issues. 

The state's fiscal crisis is driven 
by structural changes in the economy 
which are not just "the hard economic 
facts of a changing world" but federal 
policy. So far, California has lost over 
one million jobs to Oong overdue) 
defense cuts with another SOO,OOO 
expected in the coming year. 

These are not accidents but politi-
cal policy, and it is a policy decision 
to just pull out of California without 
any commitment to conversion -
military Keynesianism may have been 
all right, butconversion Keynesianism 
hasn't really been considered, to the 
woe of Califomia Meanwhile, Gov-
ernor Pete expects us to believe that 
rolling back one-half percent in sales 
tax will really make the economy go. 

Political problems have political 
solutions. The federal government is 
applying thumb-screws to the Cali-
fornia economy because Californians 
are letting it. The feds have aban-
doned their responsibility to fund the 
costs of the 1986 and 1990 immigra-
tion laws, with Governor Pete left to 
stoke up xenophobia as the state bud-
get is forced to cover these costs. 

Meanwhile, Governor Pete pro-
tects upper-income tax brackets and 
large corporations from paying their 
fair share of the costs of the state's 
budget crisis. And the reason he can 
get away with it is simple: legislators 
are too scared to take him on and raise 
taxes because their constituents 
haven't made it clear that such moves 

Monday, May 10, 1993 

are preferable to dismembering the 
few beneficial things that the state 
does. 

California thus confronts what is 
tantamount to the kinds of interna-
tional Monetary Fund austerity re-
gimes familiar in the Third Workland 
recently introduced in Russia, with 
public services being destroyed. The 
Bear Flag Republic is now a banana 
republic. It's worth noting that West-
ern societies are'unique in consider-
ing education to be an expense rather 
than an essential and integral pan of 
life. We may all pay for this down the 
road. 

H anyone cares about this wretched 
state of affairs, • advise them to edu-
cate themselves and exert political 
pressure. Contact A.S. External or 
attend Thursday's Education Crisis . 
Carnival to find out what you can do, 
or just sit back. and take it with a smile. 

• The regents' motion fordismissal 
of the UCB case was accepted by the 
Superior Court. But the sad part here 
is that few if any of the merits of the 
case were considered by the court, 
with a legal technicality on evidence 
preventing most of the UCB' s argu-
ments from being heard. But the fight 
might not be over. Stay tuned. 

• When the current phase of the 
war between the administration and 
the C<Hlps began, the fonner justified 
its actions with concern over the 
soundness of the co-ops business prac-
tices. The A.S. just recently signed a 
version ofa Memorandum of Under-
standing with the administration that 

i~ far more questionable from the 
perspective of sound business deal-
ings than any co-op practices. 

Beyond the docwnent's ambigu-
ities, at crucial junctures it gives the 
administration a blank check to re-
write the agreement and could forfeit 
various rights to autonomy. For ex-
ample, the administration retains the 
right to more or less unilaterally re-
wrile policies and procedures apply-
ing to the co-ops, with which the 
memorandum would compel them to 
comply. Signing blank checks is not 
sound business practice, and the co-
ops - or any business - would be 
foolish to agree. 

Further, the memorandum con-
cedes administration ownership of the 
University Centers, paid for by stu-
dents. Bad move. Hopefully, clearer 
A.S. thinking prevails on Monday.

U CB: Court rules 
in favor of the

". still think we have a claim. 
[Peterson] dido 't really appear to be 
listening to the point made by Craig 
[Barkus, Burnett's attorney]," 
Carroll said. 

Carroll has actively supported 
the board's legal efforts. Most re-
cently, he signed a non-academic 
grievance against Watson that ac-
cused Watson of violating UCSD 
policy when he disestablished the 
UCB. 

Carroll did nO! rule out the possi-
bility that the case may be tried in a 
federal coun as a violation offourth 
amendment rights, but he said he 
considered the scenario "unlikely." 

"The only way a federal coun

would abandon

charges tuition," says University of 
California Students Association 
(UCSA) Legislative Assistant Felipe 
Bolivar. "The Master Plan is the 
tenant we have lived by since 1960. 
We can live with all the other op-
tions [in the bill) except tuition .... 
We're not going to budge on tu-
ition." 

But Staph-Walters said the bill 
is an attempt to create a predictable 
policy for funding higher educa-

COMPU'IERS: 
Data storage has seen 
technological growth 
Continued from page 3 
becomes more and more compact 
on disks. The technology behind the 
reading arm is also important. 

Schultz ' research deals with the 
actual magnetic particles which store 
the infonnation, that is, individual 
bits of storage. The more knowl-
edge gained on these tiny particles, 
the more dense disks can become. 

Themagnetic particles examined 
by Schultz run computers under a 
principle known as the Faraday ef-
fect - that a small magnet moved 
through a coil of wire will induce a 
voltage. That voltage then becomes 
pan of a larger signal. 

A new type of magnetic record-
ing research being conducted by 
ProfessorofPhysics Ami Berl<owiaz 
may lead to a fantastic 1000fold 
jump in computer storage density. 

Unlike the normal mode of stor-
age relying. on the Faraday effect, 
the storage method researched by 
Berkowitz stems from the reaction 
of some materials to magnetic fields. 

These so-called magnetoresistive 
materials experience a change in 
their resistance when subjected to 
magnetic fields . The resistance 
change would affect the amount of 
current and voltagerunningthrough 
a computer's insides. 

Such magnelOresistive materi-
als would be used in the arms that 
read disk information, potentially 
increasing disk density 100 times. 

Rapid advances in magnetic tor-
age technology have increased the 
capability of computers, causing 
tunnoil in the computer industry 
because of the rapid changes. Ac-
cording to Schultz, the purpose of 

case would work is if the A.S. and 
the GSA would take it together," he 
said. 

At the hearing, Barkus argued 
that the case should go to trial be-
cause certain facts remained un-
clear, such as the advisory status of 
the board and the board's ability to 
issue space agreements . 

Kelly rebutted Barkus' argument, 
telling the court that the UCB only 
hadthepowertomakespacealloca-
tion "recommendations." 

Kelly added that if the ueB's 
claims were true, "Anytime a stu-
dent group had a dispute, it could go 
out, file a lawsuit and bill it to the 
university." 

Peterson's decision to bar a 1984 
A.S. election pamphlet eliminated 
an important piece of Barkus' argu-
ment. The pamphlet contained in-
formation on a ballot measure to 
increase the Student Center fee that, 
according to Carroll, "clearly indi-
cated that students would have con-

tion in California. She added that 
the current state policy limiting fee 
increases to 10 percent per year has 
been ignored for the past several 
years. 

"Everybody knows 10 percent is 
no longer realistic," she said. 

The bill would set tuition at a 
percentage of the actual cost of in-
struction and would include safe-
guards limiting how much that per-
centage could increase. The tuition 
would be phased in over a three-to-
four-year period. 

Staph-Walters added that the bill 
would encourage the UC and CSU 
systems to review how they cur-
rently do business and ask them to 

Tuesday'ssymposium was to deter-
mine whether or not CMRR could 
help in manufacturing research. 

"The question was, 'Can we at 
the university level help the produc-
tivity of American industry by pro-
viding in research and training in 
advanced manufacturing?'" Schultz 
said. "If [there is] an increase in 
density by 100 in five to seven years, 
it's going to require dramatic 
changes in manufacturing." 

Leading manufacturers were 
present at the symposium, includ-
ing IBM/Adstar President Ray 
AbuZayyad. "We have to learn to 
use technology to bring about eco-
nomic advancement, which trans-
lates to better manufacturing," Abu 
Zayyad said. 

According to Schultz, one of the 
key ways to increase manufacturing 
efficiency involves venical integra-
tion, in which one company manu-
factures a product nearly from start 
to finish instead of buying parts 
from other companies. 

Despite Schultz' expressed in-
terest in manufacturing research, 
"Because of the declining resources 
at the university, it's hard to do 
anything new," he said. 

Schultz said the future of the 
center remains unclear, since the 
magnetic recording industry is 
changing quickly. He predicted that 
the maximum storage attainable by 
magnetic methods will probably be 
reached in about 15 years. 

Under that scenario, biological 
or optical infonnation storage sys-
tems would probably attain more 
importance, and some CMRR re-
search could involve such storage. 

"Given the tremendous capital 
and skill that has been put into mag-
netic recording, J think it would be 
foolish not envisioning it as an im-
ponant product," Schultz said.

Aguilar said that the decision 
ended the distraction that the law-
suit created for the University Cen-

was formed to replace the UCB. 

"I feel relieved that a decision 
has been made, and we can hope-
fully go forward with the [manage-
ment] of the university centers," he 
said. 

"It is now clear that advisory 
bodies must conduct themselves in 
the best interest of all service, not 
just special interests," he added. 

Carroll said that the ,case did not 
speak well of the judicial system in 
this state as a whole.

measures proposed by the bill. "It's 
just a lot of compromise," she said. 

Bolivar added that the large num-
ber of amendments added to the bill

Mike Holmes spoke to council. He reported that the board discussed the 
formation of a charter in last Thursday's meeting, but that it will probably not 
be drawn up until this sunmer. In Council Caucus, a straw poll called by Fifth 
College Junior Senator Andrew Clark found that the council supported the 
drawing up of a charter immediately because of the lack of students over 
the summer.

with student issues. The departments will research ways to solve problems 
regarding student autonomy, alternative housing, parking and student 
privacy. She wrote that each department will be headed by an executive 
advocate, and urged new council members to apply for these executive 
advocate positions.

RACE: Report 
critical of UCSD's 
hiring practices 
ContInued from ..... 1 

According to Associate Chan-
cellor Nolan PeM, who was co-
chair of the task force, the repon 
also sends a strong warning to su-
pervisors and employees whodon't 
treat fellow woders fairly. 

'1be message is you~re not go-
ing to get away with it," he said. 
"It's intolerable." 

Penn said that holding supervi-
sors accountable for their behavior 
would help insure fair treatment for 
all workers. For example, affirma-
tive action practices will be reviewed 
before employees eligible for ad-
vancement are promoted. 

"It won't just be a slap on the 
wrist," said PeM. "It will tell people 
we're serious." 

Talamantez added that the Staff 
Sub-Committee of the Chancellor's

Affirmative Action Advisory Com-
mittee will be charged with over-
seeing implementation of the rec-
ommendations and enforcing 
affirmative action policies. 

PeM stressed that maintaining 
communication between co-work-
ers and l1W1Bgers is crucial to elimi-
nating discrimination in the work-
place. 

"We're saying take [your prob-
lems] to your groups and let's talk 
about it," he said. "No one's trying 
to run away, but everyone has to 
participate. " 

According to PeM, the task force 
recomme:1ded that all available re-
sources be used to informally re-
solve conflicts before formal rem-
edies such as a grievance or litiga-
tion are pursued. 

For example, Penn said that to 
resolveadispute, an employee could 
seek a neutral third party to mediate 
a dispute between a co-worker or 
employer before tuming to a griev-
ance officer or taking legal action to

The UCSD Guardian 

resolve a disagreement. 
But according to Talamantez, 

mediation isn't always an option for 
some employees. 

"Some people don't feel com-
fortable with mediation," she said. 
"It's a middle-class process, and it's 
relatively new." 

Talamantez said the fonnation 
of a strong employee relations unit 
would do "much, much more than a 
mediator" because it would provide 
workers with an internal neutral 
party that is familiar with UCSD 
policies. 

She added that SAA is currently 
working on an a1temati ve process to 
mediation. 

If the recommendations to the 
chancellor are implemented, 
Talamantez said she expects SAA 
"will change its thrust." She ex-
pressed hope that the organization 
will become more proactive and 
hold more authority. 

"What we want to do is give the 
staff association a stronger role in

presenting issues on an infonnal 
level," Penn said. 

Medical Center Superintendent 
Jonathan Mathis, one of the em-
ployees who complained of racial 
discrimination, was skeptical of the 
task force's recommendations. 

"The reports look good on paper, 
but there's noenfon:ement, "he said. 

Mathis said that "too many 
people were fed up [with discrimi-
nation] and came together" to voice 
concems to the campus administra-
tion. He cited lack of minority ad-
vancement as one of his main con-
cerns. "The system looks for rea-
sons not to promote minorities," he 
said. 

So far, Penn said, the effon has 
been "dismally unsuccessful" in 
moving minorities into the upper 
echelons of management. 

''11lc 'glass ceiling' is down low 
- into the early managerial posi-
tions," he said. 

Penn added that one of the task 
force's recommendations is to "ex-

Monday, May 10, 1993 

pand the sphere of influence" and 
"stabilize funding" of campus pr0-
motions programs that facilitate 
advancement of minorities. 

The task force, which was fonned 
last December, met with the Afri-
can-American, ChicanolLatino, 
Pan-Asian and Native American 
staff associations to pinpoint issues 
of concern for ethnic minority em-
ployees. 

According to Talamantez, the 
problem exists between co-workers 
as well as with supervisors. 

"People felt impotent," she said. 
"They felt there's nowhere they can 
go to solve their problem." 

Talamantez said that many work-
ers are afraid to speak up for fear of 
losing their jobs. 

"There needs to be a cultural 
change," she added. 

"I think we'll achieve a little bit 
at a time," Penn said. "I think we're 
talking about people's behavior. [ 
think it's possible to tum people's 
behavior in a better direction."

• PeaCe Corps volun-
teers help other coun-
tries adapt to the mod-
ern world 

OR GRADUATING UCSD S11JDENTS, VOL-
unteering with the United States Peace 
Corps has become an attractive op-
tion. Peace Corps veterans report that 
their two years of service is both 
personally rewarding and looks good 
on a resume. And with today's tough 
job market, any kind of competitive 
edge is valuable. 

But residents of the UCSD com-
munity who have volunteered in the 

Peace Corps say the experience has 
enhanced their personal development even more 
than it has their employment opportunities.The 
recession and President Clinton's recent boost 
of support for the program has prompted many 
graduating students to can ider the Corps as an 
altemative to working in the private sector. [n 
fact, recent statistics rank UCSD eleventh in the 
country for the number of alumni who become 
Peace Corps volunteers. "We're pleased to see 
UCSD continue its excellent tradition of pro-
viding an atmosphere that promotes a strong 
sense of social conscience and volunteerism," 
says Arnaldo H. Resendez, Peace Corps area 
manager. "UCSD consistently ranks near the 
top among universities In the number of volun-
teers it fosters." 

The Peace Corps experience is unforget-
table. Just ask Scott Morgenstem, a former 
Peace Corps volunteer and UCSD graduate 
student in political science. He served in West-
ern Samoa from 1985 to 1988. After graduating 
from Occidental College with a double major in 
economics and political science, he sent job 
applications to bank and insurance companies 
until he realized that he "didn't want to sit 
behind a desk." 

Instead, Morgenstem taught math and En-
glish to students in Samoa. He returned with an 
appreciation for Samoan culture and a whole 
new view of many aspects of American life.

CORPs: Many 
volunteers experience 
culture shock 
ContInued from .... 51 
play with makeshift toys like rocks and 
keys, he was shocked upon returning 
by America's consumeristic way of 
life. "We need so many things," 
Morgenstern explains. "[In Samoa]. 
the whole entenainrnent is conversa-
tion and enjoying other people's com-
pany." 

The living conditions, he says, were 
very simple. He lived in the only house 
in the village pan of the time, but also . 
resided in the villagers' quarters -
huts on the beach. The huts had no 
walls, electricity or running water. 
Cooking was done over an open flame 
and utensils for the fire were made 
from coconut husks. "You get used to 
it very, very quickly," says 
Morgenstern. 

"More of a culture shock was com-
ing back [to the United States]. You've 
lived here your whole life, and you 
don't realize all the consumerism, cars 
and television." Although he feels he is 
basically the same type of person that 
he was before he joined the Peace 
Corps, Morgenstern continues to enjoy 
the simple aspects oflife. "I'm not into 
shopping! II he jokes. 

Another aspect of Samoan life that 
affected Morgenstern was the incred-
ible friendliness of the people. "Any-
body that sees you will invite you in for 
dinner, then for the night, then to stay 
for a week." The Samoans are also 
extremely family-oriented. 
Morgenstern recalls that when he asked 
his students what they wanted to do 
when they grew up, they all answered 
that they wanted to get a job to help 
their parents. "Everybody works to-
gether. They call it the 'Samoan way. ' 
I try to ~member that now." 

Morgenstern compares the life of 
the Samoans to the life of American 
settlers on the frontier 100 years ago. 
"Kids helped on the farm and the people 
worked together." Although 
Morgenstern says he doesn't prefer 
the Samoan way of life, he deflllitely 
enjoyed it. "As opposed to sibling ri-
valry, it's very refreshing" he says. 

Because Morgenstern was assigned 
to the most remote part of Samoa. he 
says "there was not a lot of Western 
recreation ... Forexample, Morgenstern 
says that on Sundays, the Samoans 
have a big brunch, attend church, and 
then sleep for the rest of the day. 

The Peace Corps promotes a more 
balanced view of the United States in 
Third World countries and can create 
stronger international ties. Says local 
Peace Corps recruiter SusanAckennan, 
"They begin to see the United States in 
a different light. Two years is a long 
enough period of time to make a good 
impression. II 

Morgenstern says that many Samo-
ans had a warped view of the United 
States. Some oftheir impressions come 
from the action fllms like Rocky and 
Rambo. "Somebody asked me once if 
I had a nuclear bomb in my backyard," 
he remembers. 

As a white American, Morgenstern 
stood out in the crowd. "Every time 
you ride your bike, they yell 'White 
person!' If you laugh with them and 
have a good time, it 's fun." 

The actual process of applying to 
the Peace Corps can last up to nine 
months and requires persistence and 
patience. Applicants must have a 
bachelor's degree orthree to five years 
of experience in specific skills. Al-
though volunteers may request a spe-
ci fic country, they more often are sent 
to the next available position in their 
field of work.. 

The Peace Corps has changed con-

siderably since it was established in 
1961 by Presidentlohn F. Kennedy. 
One difference is the age of a volun-
teer; in 1961, the average age was 22. 
Today, it is 31. Minority panicipation 
has increased, along with female par-
ticipation. In 30 years, the percent of 
women in the Peace Corps has risen 
from 33 to 53 percent. 

The rise in women volunteers 
stems partly from the growing num-
ber of women interested in profes-
sional careers. 'There is a change in 
mentality since opportunities for 
women have increased in the last 30

years," speculates Ackerml\ll. How-
ever, in many of the countries that 
women volpnteers work, women have 
little or no rights. In some cultures, 
women volunteers are very restricted. 
Women stay indoors after dark, and 
are treated as second-class citizens. 
'They know this going in to thecoun-
try." says Ackerman. "But it 's hard 
knowing they 're not going to change 
that. It 's just the way it is." 

Theater Depanment Design fac-
ulty member Ron Ranson spent two 
years in the Peace Corps almost three 
decades ago. He experienced an orga-
nization far different from what it has 
become today. "I am the person [am 
today based on a lot of that experi-

Monday, May 10, 1993 

ence," reflects Ron Ranson about his 
two years spent in Nepal in the mid-
60s. At a time when major develop-
ment was occurring in that pan ofthe 
world, he was with one of the very 
first Peace Corps volunteer groups in 
Nepal. 

Ranson taught English to "ex-
tremely dedicated students," he says. 
His pupils would come to class from 
three in the afternoon until ten at night 
and sleep on the tables afterward. In 
the morning, they would travel back 
to their villages. Most returnees agree 
that the enlightenment of learning 
about another culture is one of the 
greatest rewards of the Peace Corps 
experience. "It 's an eye-opening ex-
perience." credits Morgenstern. 

"What they [the Nepalese] wanted 
out oflife had a tremendou,s influence 
on my ability to have fun today," says 
Ranson, a professor at UCSD since 
1979. Ranson has noticed the change 
in UCSD students over the last 10 
years. 

"In the mid-80s, [ saw a very 'me, 
me, me' attitude at UCSD, where 
students were only looking out for 
themselves. There wasn't any politi-
cal outlet. Now there is a sense of 
students saying to themselves that 
their life is lacking a purpose, and 
they are seeing that the world is get-
ting worse," Ranson says. 

"Americans can really help. We 
do that better than anybody. We still 
teach English better than anybody," 
claims Ranson. The Peace Corps 
achievements in teaching Englishasa 
second language have greatly affected 
the world. According to recently re-
leased agency statistics, over fi ve 
million people have been taught En-
glish by the Peace Corps. More than 
300 English textbooks have been de-
veloped by Peace Corps instructors 
for use in various countries. 

A large factor in the success of 
education by the Peace Corps is the 
fact that all the volunteers leam the 
dialects of the people in the villages, 
rather than just the official language 
of the country. This helps Peace Corps 
volunteers really understand the 
people and their culture. It also cre-
ates closer relationships between vil-
lages and volunteers. 

Looking back, Ranson realizes the 
impact the Peace Corps has had on 
Nepal: 'They would be nowhere with-
outthat kind ofsustainecleffort." He's 
still in touch with many friends he 
made during his two years in Nepal, 
and feels as if he has adopted a coun-
try. "I have Peace Corps friends all 
over the world. We share a common 
bond." 

Although the rewards are worth-
while, the sacrifice is great. " I never 
worked so hard in my life. But don't 
tell that to the Theater Department!" 
jokes Ranson. The tasks required of 
him were tough. "You're on all the 
time, and you ' re representing 
America ... [remember being sick and 
tired, working six days week." Per-
sonal experiences for each volunteer 
vary. because of different assign-
ments. Volunteering projects range 
widely. but the fields most in demand 
are business. math. health, agricul-
ture. forestry and the skilled trades. 

Ranson also faced the po<>{' health 
conditions of Nepal, receiving eight 
or nine vaccination shots every three 
months, and he had to deal with seri-
ous responsibilities. Once, he was 
told that there would be a famine in 
three months and to stock up on food. 
"You learn not to panic. to take things 
as they come, and deal with them," he 
explains. 

But despite the drawbacks, he still 
calls it the best time in his life. "It· s 
what's important. It's at the bottom of

my soul." 

Ranson feels that the Peace Corps 
experience helps a person look in-
ward and think more globally. "I can 't 
imagine living without that experi-
ence. Because of it, my kids think in 
a similar way," he says. 

UCSO's Opportunities Abroad 
Advisor Bill Clabby is another Peace 
Corps veteran. He and his wife volun-
teered in Senegal, West Africa from 
1985 to 1987. Clabby,a 1983 UCSO 
graduate, completed numerous rural 
projects, including organizing a well 
to be dug for a village, teaching cloth 
dying and sewing, irrigation projects, 
giving health talks and arranging ba-
sic medical training for a village man 
to open a small clinic. In the process, 
he also learned two languages and 
gained insight into his own American 
culture. 

'That's when 1 frrst realized that 
most of the world doesn't live the way 
we do," says Clabby. "It showed me 
there are also some things lacking 
here." A major cultural difference 
Clabby noticed was the greeting of a 
stranger. If you went into a post office 
and simply asked for help, they would 
ignore you and walk away. "You have 
to show you care about them more 
than business. That's what's missing 
here. [In the village 1 human beings 
are more important than business." 

Christie Fish, who graduated from 
Revelle in December, will leave next 
month for a two-year Peace Corps 
tour in Poland, where she will teach 
English. Fish learned that she was 
going to Poland only two months ago. 
After requesting to be sent to Eastern 
Europe after studying for a year in 
Cambridge and visiting Europe 
through the Education Abroad Pro-
gram, she becarne fascinated by East-
ern Europe and received a minor in 
Russian history from UCSO, Fish 
also has a history of volunteering. 

"I wanted to take a break, but do 
something worthwhile," Fish said 
When she returns two years later, 
Fish hopes to go to graduate school 
and eventually work for the U.S. for-
eign service. 'The Peace Corps opens 
a lot of doors for you when you come 
back. It prepares you," comments Fish. 
A common misconception about the 
Peace Corps is that workers will fall 
behind on the job ladder because of 
losing two years of job e)(perience, 
but most employers prefer Peace 
Corps veterans.

In the mid-8Os, I saw a very 'me, me, me' 

attitude at UCSD, where studelds were 

only looking out for themselves. Now there 

is a sense of the students saying to 

themselves that their 6fe is lacking of a 

purpose, and they are seeing that the world 

is getting worse. 

RON RANSON 
UCSD professor and former Peace Corps voJunleer 

m 
are already making plans to join the 
Peace Corps. Revelle senior Amy 
Breeze, graduating with a degree in 
psychology, hopes to work in the 
field of deaf education. 

When asked why she wants to join 
the Peace Corps. Breeze says, "I didn't 
know what else to do. Ijust wanted to 
try something new and different. It's 
kind of like an adventure." Breeze 
hopes to go to Africa, but if a different 
country has an earlier available posi-
tion, she says that she is willing to 

serve there as well. 
Another Revelle senior, philoso-

phy major Carrie Cahill also will join 
thePeaceCorps after graduation. Hav-
ing gained experience in an Alaskan 
cannery during her summers, Cahill 
will work in the fisheries program, 
"Hopefully ,I'll bring something help-
ful. I don't want to just westernize the 
world," comments Cahill,

BASEBAI,I4: 
Tritons end the season 
with two wins over 
Biola University 
ContInued from .... 18 

' 'It WlL'ia lot tolhinkabout, but things 
just seemed to work 0lJl," said Miyake. 

Dan O'Brien foUowed with a one-
outsingieroscoreMiyake.AftrrDanock 
singlcd, Oaig Birlc smacked a base hit 
to drive in O'Brien. The hits kept COOl-
ing off Eagle starttt Mike GerliIZ, with 
Buu Aaron picking up an infield hit to 
score Darrock. Adding up the damage, 
UCSD pickod up three runs on five hits 
in the first inning. 

In the third, Biola pickod up a run 
when Miyake threw wildly to first, al-
lowing Marsh to score from second. 
The Eagles continued to claw their way 
back and evened the score in the fifth. 
After Eagle Matt Guinn stroked a 
one-out triple to right, Marsh (5-4) 

sin~led him in. Jordan followed with 
a double down the left field line, 
knotting the score at 3-3. 

UCSD took the lead back in their 
half of the sixth, with the rally start-
ing on a Birk single. Aaron sacri-
ficed him to second, and Pat Hart 
ripped a triple to score Birk. Glenn 
Nahmias stepped up and laid down 
a perfect suicide squeeze bunt, ex-
tending the lead to 5-3. 

UCSD put the game away in the 
eighth, knocking out Gerlitz (2-5) 
in the process. Aaron singled with 
one out, and Hart (2-4) singled as 
well. 

Eagle Bruce Whitney was sum-
moned from the bullpen, but he 
provided no relief, walking Nahmias 
and Abramson back-to-back. 
Miyake sent a sacrifice fly to deep

centerfield, and Arban drove in 
Nahmias with a single to close out 'IIIe SconIIIoenI 
the scoring for UCSD. 

Luhrsen (6-6) kept the Eagle bats 
quiet after the fifth, giving up seven 
hits and two earned runs over nine 
innings for the victory. 

Sean Darrock provided much of 
the punch in the Tritons' lineup 
over the last week, and Coach Lyle 
Yates was quick to credit Darrock 
on his recovery from a season-long 
injury. 

"He was on fire today, and you 
can just see what we've been miss-
ing all year in our lineup," he said. 

The game was the last for 
Magdaleno, Nahmias and Hart, and 
all three seniors went out with a 
bang. Nahmias had the crucial 
squeeze bunt in the second game, as 
well as a couple of walks, and Hart 
had a triple and single in his final 
two at-bats. 

Magdaleno, who had struggled 

UCSD 5 R 

BIOLA 2 3 

through a miserable second-half 
slump, came up as a pinch-hitter in 
the eighth and ripped a blast to the 
wall in center, which was snagged 
for an out. 

"[The slump] really demoralized 
me. I don't know what happened. I 
just got into a rut and couldn't get 
out of it. But I have a lot of good 
memories to look back on," he said. 

Coach Yates saw the double-
header sweep as an important tran-
sition into next season. 

'This is going to plant a good 
feeling into theirminds heading into 
next year's fall program. It was 
very important to finish up this 
way," he said. 

COACHES 
ContInuM from .... 18 
letic department with big bucks. 
UCSD's basketball program would 
be the sole entrant in the 20-20-20 
club. Twenty wins, a top-20 national 
ranking, and 20 rules infractions. And 
the lovable Tarbnian would deny 
every allegation, saying he has "a 
great bunch of kids." 

With Switzer and Tarbnian on 
UCSD'spayroll, why not roll the dice 
and hire Pete Rose as head baseball 
coach? Sure, it might be a bit of a 
gamble, but who knows more about 
baseball that the game's all-tirne hit 
leadet1 

The Tritons would supplant Stan-
ford as the kings of college baseball, 
thanks to Rose. Pete would be a great 
addition to the UCSD coaching fam-
ily. Bet on it. 

Crew Sweeps 
San Luis Obispo 

It' s beginning to sound like a 
broken record. 

For the fifth straight year, the 
UCSD men 's crew team swept all 
three events in a dual meet with Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. 

The varsity-8 boat crossed the 
line five seconds ahead of the Mus-
tangs, 6: 15-6:20, while the novice-
S squad were six seconds better 
than the San Luis team, 6:24-6:30. 
The UCSD B boat was just behind 
at 6:31. 

The Tritons' novice-4 rounded 
out the sweep with a 7: 15-7:20 win 
over SLO. 

- Gregg Wrenn 

SPORTS 11 

Of course, the UCSD athletic de-
partment shouldn't stop there. Track 
and field could get a boost with the 
hiring of Sen Johnson. As a matter of 
fact, Johnson's mere presence would 
be performance-enhancing. 

The soccer program should hire 
Diego Maradona - with Maradona 
as coach. soccer would become the 
most addictive game in town. And 
with John Daly in charge of the golf 
team, the kegs would be a-flowin' at 
Torrey Pines every weekend. 

With the millions - no, billions 
of dollars in revenue generaled by the 
UCSD athletic department - the UC 
budget crisis would become a distant 
memory, the Tritons would field the 
greatest teams in college sports, and 
nobody would look at that sleepy 
campus in La Jolla the same way 
again. I'm buying my season tickets 
today.

UCSD Finishes With a Win 
SUF IBA"o Tritons'find 
offense in final game 
ByGNaWrenn 
Sports Editor 

In a ~ filled with more valleys 
than hills, splitting Satwday' s season-
ending doubleheader with CI"OOS-town 
nemesis USD was a defmite upswing 
for the UCSD softball team. The em-
battled Tritons dropped the first game to 
the T orcras, 4-1, beforedi.scoveringtheir 
offeme and winning the nigltcap 8-5. 

Krib1i McCauley was on the mound 
for UCSD (6-28) for the first game. 
McCauley h9s been the most consistent 
of the Triton pitchers this season, but 
once again she received little offensive 
support to bolster her effort. 

Things brigkened considerably for 
the Tritons in the second game. Lisa 
Gill, who was recently converted to 
pitcher, took the mound for the flfSt four 
innings followed by Calhy O'Connor 
who finished the game. _ 

Gill and teammate Sara Vaplon both 
nailed triples to help lead the UCSD 
offensive onslaught 

"[Gill] carne in and did a super job. 
We finally got a lot of hits and had the 
good fielding," Head Coach Patricia 
Gerckens said 'We ended the season 
on a poSitive note, and it felt good." 

Jason Ritchle/GUMlIan 
cathy o'Connor pitched the tlnal three Innings to help UCSD win. 

Tritons Play the Occidental Tourists 
TRACK II FIELD: UCSD picks up record-breaking ~orrnances at invitational 
By BrIan K. Hutto 
Staff Writer 

In athletics, no one plans to fail, 
but many fail to plan. Expertly 
avoiding this pratfall, the Triton 
coaching staff has prepped both 
men's and women's track and field 
teams to sheer perfection, produc-
ing prime perfonnances under pres-
sure. 

The UCSD coaching coalition of 
Tony SaIemo, Ted Van Arsdale, Wes 
Williams and Roger Kamopp have col-
lectively prepared their athletes espe-
cially for this time of the season, when 
the pressure situations of competing in 
big meets and producing national quali-
fying standards are most conunon. The 
Tritons have certainly proved respon-
sive,judging bytheirperfonnanceatthe 
Occidental College Invitational held last 
Salurday in Los Angeles. 

Only 22 teams made the pilgrimage 
north, but many of those that partici-
pated in the very competitive event set 
new personal records. Several Tritom 
also nailed previously elusive national 
qualifying staridaJlk. 

"This wa<i a fairly high-ca\iber invi-
tational featuring a few elite Divisioo I 
schools [UOA, USCJ," said Salerno. 
"Michaela Monahan had the [opportu-

In the Bleachers 

Jason Anderson 
oity] to nm with Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
in the hunlles. "Monahan finished with 
a time of 65.75, a mere eight seconds 
behind the Olympic champion. 

Wafa Hama paced the women, rac-
ing to a naIionaI <pWifying time of 
10: 16.23 in the 3,lXXl meters. 

Karen Hinkle just missed the stan-
dard in the 1,500 meters, but ran a 
personal recmJ of 4:47.45. Lama Peck 
also ran the 1,500 meters, finishing in 
5:07.3. 

Robyn Herskowitz in the SOOmeters 
(2:20.53) and Renee Sprowl in the 100-
meter high hurdles (15.42) both cel-
ebrated new best times. 

Although the women' s 4x I 00 relay 
of Michelle Domico, Erica Washing-
ton, Sprowl and Monahan notched a 
provisional qualifying mark (49.34), 
they will probably have to run faster to 
make the exclusive national field, ac-
cording to Salemo. 

On the men's side, Pat Foy and 
MarK Yuen both sprinted to personal 
records in the 800 meters with times of 
I :51.65 and I :51.26, respectively. 

"A lot of people in the distance and 
middle distance [events 1 ran well," said 
Salerno. 'This is about the time where 
they should be coming through with 
their best times." 

JeffSchnitz recorded ajavelin mark 
of 179'6" and Jeff Hernandez lowered 
his 3,OOO-meter steeple chase mark 
(9:25.82). 

Stephan Wynn (3:56.50) led the 
Tritonpack,whichincludedManRinger 
(3:58.80)andquickly improvingsopho-
more Scott Leon (3:59.17) in the 1,500 
meters. 

"Everything is pan of a loog-tenn 
plan," said Salerno. "Most of the team 
rested wt weekend [for the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association Cbam-
pionships held this weekend at UCSD]. 
The coaches are very pleased at where 
we are right now."

16 SPORTS 

AlU 

lIT 
Big Names Mean 
Big Bucks 

UCSD's spons department is the 
class of Division m, wiMers of a 
truckload of national titles. The 
Tritons have won championships in 
almost every sport. Yet nobody 
outside of campus seems to know or 
care. I was interviewing for a job the 
other day, and the interviewer asked 
me about my current employment. 
''I'm the associate sports editor for the 
UCSD Guardian," I said. Then came 
the all-too-familiar response. 

"You write spons for UCSD? I 
didn't even know UCSD had any 
spons teams," he said. 

What UCSD's athletic department 
has is an image problem. Who cares if 
Triton athletes compete without 
scholarships, dominate their given 
sporting event and earn their degree 
without the help of shady boosters? 

UCSD could get over its anonym-
ity problem real quickly with a move 
to Division I. With the UC system in 
financially dire straits, is a move to 
Division I such a good idea? Abso-
lutely. That's why UCSD should just 
funnel all that money for piddly 
concerns like cancer research, global 
warming and the supercomputer into 
the athletic department. With such a 
healthy budget, UCSD could hire the 
best coaches in the country. It's a big 
financial risk, but it's an investment 
that would return enormous divi-
dends. Sellout crowds, national 
prominence, shoe contracts, lucrative 
TV deals. And that'sjilst the tip of the 
iceberg. 

First and foremost, UCSD should 
start a football program and hire Barry 
Switzer as head coach. Switzer's 
sparkling reputation would be a public 
relations godsend. With a football 
team under Switzer's reign, UCSD 
athletics would never be the same. 
The Murph would be packed every 
Saturday night, the cross-town game 
against San Diego State would be a 
barnbumer year after year, and the 
Tritons would be lining up against the 
big boys like Miami, Alabama and 
Michigan every New Year's Day. 
With Switzer at the helm, even 
everyday campus life would be more 
exciting. Fully automatic weapons in 
all the dorm rooms - there's nothing 
like a good frrefight before a big game 
or that o-chem midterm. 

Best of all, the Tritons would 
squash hapless UC Riverside by at 
least fifty points in the annual 
homecoming game. 

The next big move would be the 
hiring of Jerry Tarkanian as basketball 
coach. Nodoubtabout it, the gym would 
be rockin' non-stop with "Tark the 
Shark" in charge. Tarkanian's Tritons 
would be a cash cow. The newly built, 
20,000 seat Tark's Tank would sell out 
every game. Souvenir vendors wouldn't 
be able to keep enough of those cute, 
cudd1y shark hand puppets on the 
shelves. And the annual visit to the Final 
Four would overwhelm the UCSD ath-

tion in the People's Republic 
of China, threw out the cer-
emonial frrstpitch to celebrate 
the IO-year anniversary of 
the team 's trip to China. Then

ing a run off Eagle starter 
Sonny Gritftn. Sophomore 
sensation C1uis Miyake, en-
tering the doubleheader with 

a l6-game hitting streak, led off the inning with a 
double. Sean Darrock followed suit with an RBI-
double of his own to give UCSD a 1-0 lead. 

Lefty hurler Steve Height stumbled slightly in the 
third inning. Biola's Scott Blackwell reached on a 
Miyake error and took second when Curtis Marsh 
walked. Scott Jordan followed with a base hit to score 
Blackwell. Then Jordan took off for second, and as he 
stole the bag, Marsh raced from third and snuck into 
home, scoring the Eagle's second run. Those un-
earned runs would be all the Eagles would muster in 
this game. 

In the bottom of the third, UCSD scratched out

the plate on a Bobby Arban fielder's choice. 

After another single run in the fourth, the Tritons 
picked two more runs off Griffin (3-6) in the fifth on 
an RBI-single by Darrock and an RBI-groundout by 
Marcos Magdaleno, giving UCSD a 5-2 lead. Height 
(3-6) was brilliant on the mound, limiting the Eagles 
to three hits over seven innings to pick up the win. 

Miyake's two doubles gave him 18 for the year, 
breaking the club record set last season by Ernie Isola. 

.In the second game, to nobody's surprise, UCSD 
starter Kurt Luhrsen went the distance again in a 8-3 
victory. Miyake drilled a base hit into left field in his 
first at-bat, extending his record hitting streak to 18 
games.
