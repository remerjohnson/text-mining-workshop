A fire in lbe Broadmore Homes Condominiums, just south of the campus, destroyed one 
condominium unit and heavily damaged two others last night around midnight. Nancy Laga, an AS 
Representative, was first to report tbe fire to police, and based on her description of "several small 
Iigbted piles" in the condominium, arson is suspected. Another fire last month in virtually the same 
place fizzled out before any damage could be done. The burning condominiums. still only wooden 
frames. located at the corner of Caminito Vivo and Gilman Dr. were attended to by nine fire 
engines. The fire was extinguisbed in about thirty minutes. 

Theater Planned Here 
UC San Diego will have a new 

theater on campus by the fall 
quarter oT 1_: according fo a 

. report by the Summer Task 
Group on Resource Require-
ments. 

Construction is set to begin in 
July of next year on a three-
acre site at the southern 
extremity of Revelle College. 
The building will be a joint 
project of the UC Regents and 
the Theater and Arts Founda-
tion of San Diego County. 

Michael Addison, a UCSD 
professor of drama, said that 
the theater will seat 500 people. 
He emphasized that it is not 
designed to be "a lavish five-
theater facility, to but will , 
instead, be "bare-bones, to 

supplying the facilities neces-
sary for traininl students in the 
technical aspeCts of theater. 

The main source of funding 
for the project is the Theater 
and Arts Foundation of San 
Diego County, a group that has 
been working towards building 
a theater in this area for the 
past 40 years, but pnly now has 
obtained the necessary funds 
and a location it desired. 
According to the agreement it 
made with the Regents, the 
Foundation will supply a total 
of $2.2 million to be spent in 
erecting and equipping the 
theater. 

For its part, the University is 
obligated to repair and replace 
equipment, and generally 

Honors Requirements 
Toughened ,by Senate 

By Steve Morus 
A resolution passed last May 

by the UCSD AC4ldemic Senate 
will dramatically lower the 
number of graduates receiving 
honors. The resolution will 
change the awarding of honors 
from a fixed GPA base to a 
percentage limit in an attempt 
"to make honors mean some-
thing," said Professor Robert 
Linck. 

According to Linck, last 
year's chairman of the Aca-
demic Senate's Undergraduate 
Scholarship and Honors Com-
mittee, honors will only be 
given to the top 14% of all UCSD 
graduates, down from the 
current 50"10. Under the new 
system, only the top 2% may 
receive highest honors, the next 
4"0 high honors, and the 
following 8% honors. 

automatically received cum 
1aude, summa cum laude, or 
magna cum laude honors 
respectively. 

The change is being made to 
place the percentage of UCSD 
graduates with honors more in 
line with the percentages of the 
other UC campuses, Linck said, 
citing Irvine's 12% honors 
figures as evidence. Ten years 
ago only 20% of UCSD grad-
uates received honors, he adds, 
blaming grade inflation for the 
dramatic rise. 

maintain the building. Summer 
use of the University Theater 

. wID be under the purview of the 
Foundation. 

In the agreement, both the 
University and the Foundation 
commit themselves to pro-
grams in the theater for 
underprivileged and culturally 
deprived children. Addison, for 
his part, says that this may 
involve internships or special 
weekend performances. 

Both Ewart Goodwin, of the 
Theater Arts Foundation, and 
Addison expressed the opinion 
that, upon its completion, the 
theater will be a great asset to 
the student body as well as to 
the general public. They agree 
that the facility is long overdue 
and will benefit tM community 
culturally and socially.

Oak Knoll .Area 
To be Kept for 
Artifact Study? 

By John Hondros 
Community Editor 

Because of its archaeological 
significance, a 25-acre knoll 
located off of La Jolla Shores 
Drive may be retained by the 
University for the purpose of 
excavating Indian artifacts, 
while the University-owned La 
Jolla Farms Racetrack may be 
leased for commercial use, 
according to UCSD Campus 
and Community Planner Pat-
ricia Collum. Ba,sed upon 
research done by the UCSD 
Campus and Community Plan-
ninK Committee (CCPC), the 
Chancellor's Board of Over-
seers made the recommen-
dations concerning the knoll 
and the racetrack located 
between the main campus and 
Scripps Institute of Ocean-
ography at a meeting last 
Thursday. 

During its deliberations, the 
CCPC learned that the knoll is 
an archaeological resource of 
major significance, Collum 
said. The knoll was recorded on 
Malcom Rogers' 1929 survey of 
coastal sites in southern 
California and Northern Baja 
California , fieldwork spon-
sored by the Smithsonian 
Institutir,n . At that time, 
surface examinations and test 
excavation were undertaken. 
R'ogers collected three human 
burials from the sea cliff. This 
finding has been verified by 
archaeologists from the Mu-
seum of Man, the Peabody 
Foundation for Archaeology, 
UCSD, San Diego State Uni-
versity and a private consulting 
firm, Collum added. 

The CCPC and the Board of 
Overseers recoQ1men\:ted to the 

Chancellor that the knoll be 
retained by the University and 
placed in the University of 
California Natural Land and 
Water Reserves System 
(NL WRS), Collum said. The 
objective of the NLWRS is to 
develop and maintain , for 
educational and scientific 
study, a system of natural 
reserves representative of 
California's natural environ-
ment. 

Collum said the CCPC was 
not able to identify, for the 
foreseeable future, any viable 
academic use for the racetrack 
property. Because of the 1975 
Board action recommending 
retention of I)wnership by the 
University , the committee 
recommenaed that the race-
track be sold or leased for 
development of a mixed resi-
dential, recreational and 
services establishment , ex-
plained Collum. 

According to Collum, th 
knoll and racetrack properties 
were acquired by the Regents 
in 1967 for future academic 
uses. " The last campus plan 
was made in 1966, a year before 
the property was acquired, so it 
wasn't included in the plans," 
Collum said. " As a result, the 
university has been under 
pressure, especially by Senator 
Stull, to get rid of the property 
o it can be put back on the tax 

roles , because the University 
doesn' t have to pay property 
tax," she said. 

The University has been 
trying to decide what to do with 
the property since 1975, said 
Collum. The Board advised the 
Chancellor in 1975 to hold on to

Prfup 5 Blasted 
By Ted Navin Burke 

Tbe room. a local bar where people gather after work to have a 
few of their favorite libation while they work orr the pent up 
tensions of the daily grind, is full of cigarette smoke. Cigarettes 
are lit everywhere, from the folks in the secluded corner tables 
waiting for the meals, to the regulars at the bar, who puff intensely 
while they debate the merits of the latest Ali-Spinks fight, 
complain about the dirth of good shows on television, or any other 

. trivia they feel like filling the air with . 
Then one person stands up, shouts "You're busted," and flashes 

a badge that he had secreted under his wind breaker. Some of the 
patrons desperately try to dash their cigarettes in their drinks or 
crush them under their feet, but it's too late. Within seconds, the 
bar is full of uniformed and plain-clothed cops who round every 
offending patron they'd seen and make them lean against the bar 
to be frisked . ' 

T ... O ....... Wed., Oct. 11, 1878 

Admittedly, the above dramatization is a gross exaggeration of 
whatever effects the passage of Proposition 5 (the no-smoking 
initiative) might have, but I think it does illustrate a point. Plainly, 
I don't think that the government. whether on the state or federal 
level, has any business concerning itself with people 's personal 
habits, and I think that those who are pushing the no-smoking 
initiative are serving into the hands of a mentality that demands 

Student Power Unlikely 
that the State make arbitral): decisions about how peopie should' 
conduct their lives. 

I have no argument against those who mount campaigns to get 
others to quit smoking. There are acceptable, non-coercive 
methods in which these groups may propagate their causes, 
jncluding buying time in the media. pubHc education programs, 
and the selting up of effective programs that would help those who 
wanted to quit cease with the habit. But the proponents of 
Proposition 5 want to supersede those avenues and get law 
enforcement into the act. Whatever claims the supporters might 
claim to the contrary, it is clear that they want a legal method by 
which they can tell others what to do. under the threat of legal 
recourse. 

The matter of smoking versus not smoking is a matter best left 
for people themselves to solve. If someone is upset by the smoke 
my cigarette generates , they can conduct themselves like human 
beings with some sense of civility and innate rationality and ask 
me to put it out, or move some distance away from them so that my 
smoke won't " endanger" their health . Owners of private property 
are perfectly within their rights to make decisions concerning 
smoking and not smokinJ;!' But for a non-smoker to depend on legal 
sanctions like punk kid running for his big brother to do his dirty 
work is a repulsive thought. 

Guardian Commended 
We of the Rape Prevention 

Task Force would lik e to 
commend the editors of The 
Guardian for bringing the issue 
of harassment to the attention 
o f the UCSD Community . 
Although we take issue with 
some of the content of the 
article, we are pleased that the 
importance of this problem is 
being recognized and addres-
sed. The Rape Prevention Task 
Force was formed in a n effort 
to create community aware-
ness and responsibility to the 

issue of sexual assault and/ or 
harassment. To meet this end , 
we have designed and are 
offering a workshop intended to 
help women become aware of 
the strengths and skills availa-
ble to them in dealing with this 
very real problem . If you would

UCSD Rape Prevention 
Task Force 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Chancellor William McEl-

roy, who made himself unpop-
ular with a campus full of Day 
Care supporters last spring, 
has at least improved in the 
number of people he has upset 
with his decrees. 

This summer, while students 
were away vacationing or 
working, one of the adminis-
tration ' s favorite times for 
making controversial deci -
sions, the Chancellor offiCially 
delayed the naming of Third 
€ollege for what will probably 
beat leasttwo or three years. In . 
doing so he angered slightly 
less than a quarter of the 
University ' s students, - the 
Third College population . 

However, his rejection of the 
name "Third, " based on 
recommendations he received 
from his Advisory Committee 
on Naming Streets, Buildings, 
Colleges and Facilities is 
probably more serious than the 
Day Care controversy in the 
implications it has for the 
power of students to make and 
influence decisions at UCSD as 
long as McElroy remains 
Chancellor . 

Last spring, Third College 
conducted two mail votes of its 
staff, faculty and students to 
choose a name for the college. 
Both votes were won over· 
whelmingly by the name 
" Third ." After the debacle of 
the Fourth College naming,

made without as much as a 
single vote of even the college's 
student "eli\e," Third's nam-
ing process was properly 
lauded as democratic and fair. 

McElroy, however, looks at 
that vote as merely advisory, 
as binding as any decisions of 
one of his advisory committees. 

The committee, though. 
didn ' t even have a student 
attending its summer meet-
ings, and it is chaired by the 
Muir Provost. It recommended 
the delay of "several years" 
after hearing from "a number 
of persons" requesting that 
delay , requests which con-
firmed reservations that that 
committee had previously 
expressed. 

The elections, on the other 
hand, involved a majority of 
both Third College students and 
staff. It'is these students and 
staff who actually comprise the 
college, and for all the Advisory 
Committee's attempts to rea-
son out what is good for the 
college, Third 's population can 
give the best estimate of what it 
wants and whether it can 
continue a commitment still 
supported after almost ten 
years. 

In rejecting the name, the 
Chancellor argues that " with 
the passage of time, that name 
would lose the significance and 
emotional force that it now has 
for many persons. It might 
even come to seem inappro-
priate or ill-chosen." 

McElroy believes that in five, 
ten or even twenty years , 
Third's commitment to minor-
ities and its unique graduation 
requirements emphasizing 
understanding of social Corces 
will possibly be blunted, or even 
forgotten completely. Under 
those circumstances, he ar-
gues, the name "Third" would 
be inappropriate . 

Future students and staff, 
McElroy says, might be dis-
contented with the name, and 
even try and change it. 

Even if what McElroy pro-
jects as a possibility does come 
to pass, though, the name 

"Third" is still important as a 
reminder of what the College 
tried to do, and it could serve as 
a rallying point to ensure that a 
commitment to the type of 
programs for which it is 
praised is continued . 

Besides , though students 
form the substance of the 
College, the catalysts for 
recruitment and continuation 
of students and programs 
consistent with the Third 
College philosophy are ad-
ministrators. As long as each 
succeeding staff chooses new 
members that subscribe to 
Third 's philosophy, that philo-
sophy will likely continue. 

Since central administration 
'(the Chancellor and his various 
Vice-Chancellors) has a con-
tributing or final say in each of 
these appointments, concern 
over continuation of the col-
lege's philosophy is problem-
aric - the College will continue 
in its present state if central 
administration likes it the way 
it is . 

McElroy also argues that 
once submitted to the Regents, 
it would be impossible for 
future generations of college 
students to go back to the 
Regents and advocate another 
name. Why this is so, however, 
has never been clearly ex-
plained. If a radical change in 
commitment does occur, won't 
the Regents be eager to change 
a college name that reflects a 
philosophy most of them 
probably disagree with? 

McElroy's obvious disregard 
for the Third College popu-
lation, especially stUdents, 
belies any hope that students 
will occupy an important place 
in the decision making at th~ 
University as long as McElroy 
is Chancellor. If he won't Iilten 
to students backed by th, Dean, 
Provost, faculty and .taff, 
opposed by only a few iDIJ~teat 
staff members, what hope 1. 
there that students will be given 
any authority in areas in whidl 
they and the administration 
potentially disaaree?

Twenty-three of the 42 protest-

in their jail cells Sunday.

SALISBURY, Rhodesia (AP) 
- Rhodesia 's interim govern-
ment struck down its segrega-
tion laws Tuesday, clearing the 
way for blacks to live in white 
neighborhoods, attend white 
schools and use white hospitals 
- if they can arrord it. 

The changes were lauded by 
the biracial government as a 
significant breakthrough de-
spite the fact that only the 
wealthiest of the nation's 6.7 
million blacks will be able to 
afford the integration. The 

average earnings of blacks is 
about $830 a year compared to 
$9 ,240 for Rhodesia's 260,000 
whites. . 

The changes were announced 
as white Prime Minister Ian 
Smith and black leader the 
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole were 
in the United States seeking 
backing for their internal 
government, set up to pave the 
way to black majority rule with 
elections. Smith reported no 
headway in the quest.

NORFOLK, Va, (AP) -
Former President Gerald Ford 
took part of the credit Monday 
for the Camp David agree-
ments on a peace plan for Israel 
and Egypt, saying President 
Carter had simply carried out 
"our step-by-step poHcy." 

"Let me remind you that I got 

Israel and the Egyptians to 
agree to Sinai II in 1975," Ford 
said at a new conference. " That 
was a stepping-stone to Camp 
David." 

Ford was in Virginia to 
campaign for the Republican 
candidate for the U.S. Senate, 
John Warner. 

Cardinal Leo Suenens of 
Belgium said in an interview 
with Corriere della Sera of 
Milan, Italy's largest news-
paper: " I don ' t believe that a 
pope should be too young. A 
pontificate which lasts 20 years 
is decidely too long." 

Minister Rowan Cronje said 
schools would remain free on 
black reserva tions, while the 
$72 annual cost of white state 
schools will probably be hiked. 
But it was likely integration of 
white schools would be s lowed 
not just by lack of money, but 
also because black children 
seeking to enroll would have to 
live in the school area, must 
speak English, the minOrity 
language, and be in the proper 
age group. 

" Our conclusions will not 
satisfy the ultra-liberals, nor 
will the extreme right like 
them," said Cronje. " Blacks 
did not get it all their own way. 
We did not get it all our own 
way. But the solutions show our 
willingness to work togeth-
er ... they 're based on pragma-
tism and reality." 

Cronje would not estimate 
when the new laws will be 
passed, but agreed it could take 
until December or January. 

The target date for black rule 
is made more uncertain by the 
escalating six-year war against 
Rhodesia by black nationalist 
guerrillas , who vow to disrupt 
any attempt to get blacks to the 
polls . 

Tuesday ' s a nnounceme nt 
said land laws in white areas -
the suburbs of the seven major 
c ities - will be sc rapped . 
Blacks will be a ble to buy 
homes in a ny s uburb , said 
Cronje. But new la ws tight-
ening up on health and building 
regulations will be effected 
simultaneously.

If you law Sam Hinton

you lmow all about the special 
mu.lcal gifts this Campus 
Director of Relation. with 
Schoo .. brine' to UCSD. If you 
mia.ed him, you milled a 
chance to see a man whose 
folksinging career extends 
back to when he wal a cbild in 
the 208, who has done per-
formances ranging from 
vaudeville to records and 
eventually seen his songs 
placed on the same disk as 
songs sung by Bin, Crosby and 
Rosemary Clooney. 

Hinton's crowded Welcome 
Week concerts during the last 
four or five years have become 
a UCSD tradition. During them 
Hinton stands alone before his 
audience with only his guitar, 
harmonica and intimate knowl· 
of America's musical past to 
help him. With these and his 
broad grin and gentle voice, 
Hinton once again spins the 
same spellbinding tales he has 
professionally told since he won 
his first amateur talent contest 
when he was eight. 

He won the contest in Tulsa, 
Okla. where he was born , 
allhough he spent most of. his 
childhood in the east Texas city 
of Crockett. Arter winning the 
contest, Hinton faced the 
dilemma of whether or not to 
tell his parents the exciting 
news, since he had been 
forbidden to go to the rough 
part of town where the contest 
was held. "I finally told them," 
Hinton remembers with a 
smile, "and they forgave me," 
For his singing and harmonica 
playing Hinton received $2. "In 
those days," Hinton says , " that 
was worth (our Marine band 
harmonicas ... 

But it is in Crockett, not 
Tulsa , where Hinton ' s folk -
singing roots lie buried deep in 
soil richly fertilized by Texan, 
transplanted Oklahoman and 
Louisianian French innuences. 
According to }linton, his 
mother, a native Texan and 
music teacher, unlike most 
instructors of her time "didn't 
scorn the country tunes." When 
at the age of eight Hinton's 
grandfather gave him an 
accordian, he quickly learned a 
repertoire of over 100 country 
songs. 

It was also during his child-
hood in the wild countryside of 
Texas that Hinton developed 
his love for the animal world. 
For a time he earned extra 
money by selling the live 
lizards he caught in his back-
yard to the curator of the 
Museum of Natural History. 
Later, during the two years he 
attended college at Texas 
A&M, Hinton partially sup-
ported himself by selling the 
venom he extracted from 
poisonous snakes. In 1940 he 
graduated from UCLA with 
degrees in zoology and art, 
fulfilling what Hinton says was 
always his "driving interest 
(in) animal study." 

Two years before his gradu-
ation his musical career 
reached its professional zenith 
when Hinton performed at the 
New York City Radio City 
Music Hall as a member of the 
Trans-Continental Revue. For 
many years Hinton travelled in 
various vaudeville companies 
organized by the famous radio 
personality Major Bows. At 
that time, Hinton recalls,

Science 

NASA 
By Doug Campion 

Seleaee E ...... 
On April 12 of this year, NASA 

launched a satellite from Cape 
Canaveral in Florida. Orficially 
dubbed the High Energy Astro-
nomical Observatory (HEAO)-
I, this satellite carried into a 
low altitude orbit an experi-
ment designed by Laurence 
Peterson and James Matteson 
of the UC San Diego phYSics 
department, in conjunction 
with Dr. Walter Lewin of the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 

HEAO-l, the first of three 
such satellites to be launched, 
is designed to "scan" the sky in 
search of sources of X-rays and 
gamma-rays. Some probable 
sources of such high-energy 
radiation are quasars, those 
distant and little understood 
enigmas; pulsars, or rotating 
neutron stars; and the regio.ns 
surrounding black holes. 

During the first three months 
of the mission , the spacecraft 
was involved in what Matteson 
referred to as a " sky survey." 
Every 30 minutes, it would 
gather energy data from one 
section of the sky. Each day, 
the scan plane was moved 
about one degree, so that three 
months after HEAO·1 was 
placed in orbit, it had scruti· 
nized half of the sky. 

"At the end of three months, 
we began to do a certain 
amount of 'pointing' with the 
spacecraft," said Matteson. 
" We stopped the scan and 
pointed the spacecraft at 
selected X-ray targets." This 
directed observation is a more 
efficient means of collecting 
infonnation from known ener· 
gy sources, because in simply 
scanning, the instruments are 
actually focused on a given X· 
ray source for only about one 
hour, total. Altogether, the 
satellite has completely ex· 
amined the sky twice. Con-
tinuing the survey method is of 
relatively low importance, 
according to Matteson, and so 
the studying of specific energy 
sources will become the major 
concern . . 

"Currently, we 'point' HEAO 
10 times a week for durations of 
up to 15 hours," the physiCist 
said. 

"Originally, HEAO-1 was 
designed as a six-month mis-
sion," he explained. "That 
would be enough time to scan 
the sky completely." Ap-
parently, though, NASA and the 
physicists planned well ahead. 
Enough fuel was loaded on 
HEAO-l to power it for a year 
and a half. After the success of 
the early part of the mission, 
the decision was made to keep 
the craft functioning for a full 
year. 

"The spacecraft is expected 
to operate until about April of 
'79," Matteson said, "at which 
time we expect that its control 
system will have depleted its 
fuel, so that it will start to 
tumble. When that happens, the 
solar panels will no longer face 
the sun, the bat1t:ries will 
discharge and the spacecraft 
will die." 

Before that first tumble , 
though, HEAO-l will lain the 
company of HEAO-2, which is 
scheduled to be launched on 
Nov. 7. Tbis second satellite

a plasma , a r ich, gas-li ke 
collection of charged particles, 
and there is a strong magnetic 
field. In order to carry out 
controlled nuclear fusion - a 
source of great energy - on 
earth, these same conditions of 
plasma and magnetic field are 
required. Perhaps by observa-
tion of the naturally occuring 
phenomenon, some insight can 
be gained as to how to use such 
things as plasmas and fusi on 
efficiently. pointing, and it will seek out 

sources of X-rays from the 
energy level of those sought by 
HEAO-I, up to sources of 
several million times that 
energy. As Matteson explained, 
"By combining the observa-
tions of HEAO-l allow energies 
and the observations of HEAO-
2 at high energies, we'll get a 
more complete picture of some 
of the objects we' re studying. " 

The last of the three high-
energy observatories will be 
put into orbit sometime in Sept. 
of next year. Its function will be 
to study the emission of cosmic 
rays in space. Cosmic rays are 
not electromagnetic radiation, 
like X-rays, gamma· rays, and 
visible light. Rather, they are 
composed of highly energetic 
particles. 

"Most of what we' re dOing 
could be called basic research 
in astronomy," said Matteson. 
"That is, trying to understand 
the nature of the universe. In a 
larger context , what we ' re 
investigating is the evolution of 
stars and theories about their 
interiors. " 

One way in which the HEAO 
program will contribute to this 
understanding is in its study of 
X-ray and gamma-ray emis-
sion from pulsars. A pulsar is a 
spinning neutron star with a 
magnetic field associated with 
it, that is purported to be up to 
many million times as strong as 
the earth's magnetic field. For 
each rotation of the neutron 
star , one "pu,lse" can be 
detected in the emission of 
gamma-rays, X-rays, or radio 
waves - and some even pulse 
at all wavelengths . 

Matteson explained that 
neutron stars are important as 
cosmic phenomena because 
they are believed by many 
experts to be "the endpoint of 
stellar evolution for certain 
classes of stars." He said, 
"Stars greater than about five 
times as massive as the sun 
typically end their life with a 
supernova explosion . The 
result of that explosion is a 
fraction of the original star -
say, 10% - is left over as a 
neutron star." 

Although a neutron star is 
only about 6 to 10 miles in 
diameter, it contains as much 
mass as does the sun . Its 
density, then, is comparable to 
that of the nucleus of an atom. 

Some of the X-ray emitting 
pulsars tend to " nare up" 
momentarily, and then die 
back down. In Jan. orthis year, 
HEAO-t ' was pointed at just 
such a pulsar. Matteson: " We 
did a detailed study of the 
energy distribution of the X-
rays with the instrument that 
we built here. What we saw was 
an X-ray absorption similar to 
the optical absorption in the 
lilht from sta ..... We've inter· 
preted it as absorption by a 

tion occurs, ' you can imme-
diately derive the magnetic 
field ... 

The calculations yielded a 
result showing the pulsar' s 
magnetic field to be 1.5 trillion 
gauss (the earth's magnetic 
field is only a fraction of a 
gauss) - seeming at last to 
verify what for so long had been 
mainly theory. 

One question many chemists 
and physicists do not bother 
aSking, because the answer 
involves too much speculation, 
is, " Where did the elements 
come from? " According to 
Matteson, "the most widely 
accepted explanation" is that 
in the interiors of stars, the only 
original elements, hydrogen 
and perhaps deuterium, were 
fused together in a natural 
nuclear reaction to form 
heavier metals. This process, 
however, does not account for 
elements beyond iron (number 
26 out of 103) . The conditions 
necessary for producing the 
remaining elements do seem to 
occur, though, during a super· 
nova . 

Matteson concluded, " So the 
lead that might be in your 
gasoline today, probably was 
made in a supernova explosion 
10 billion years ago." 

know it. 

Black holes , too, can provide 
some information which may 
prove to be usable back on 
earth. For example, the region 
around one supposed black hole 
is believed to reach tempera· 
tures in the billions of degrees. 
The system around this area is 

" Occasionally , you hear 
words about how we might 
solve the energy crisis, and 
maybe someday ... " Matteson 
trailed orr. " It's not that the 
solution will be found , but 
man's understanding of physi· 
cal processes will improve."

Allen Out of Closet 

The Serious Woody Allen 
'Yes' Performs History 

By William Gibson 
Woody Allen likened the 

project of writing and directing 
his first serious motion picture, 
Interiors, to "moving to the 
grown-up's table." The analogy 
is both apt and inapt; as a 
craftsman of films, he proves 
himself at least the equal of 
most of his contemporaries. but 
as a writer. a creator. Allen 
remains a child. who couldn't 
care less for the strictures of 
modern artistic exploitation of 
immorality. a child who ex-
plores rather than teaches, who 
sees and illumines rather than 
denies the paradoxes of modern 
life, a child who is concerned. 
above all. with the agoniZing 
problem of how to live properly 
in a world without easy rules. 

Allen has learned his tech-
nical lessons well . Camera 
angle, scale and depth of field 
are employed in such a way as 
to heighten our sense of the 
effect of circumstance, both 

spatial and emotional, on the 
characters as a group. The 
lighting and sound are ex-
quisite. the editing both smooth 
and abrupt, the scene deallDS 
are sparse and accentuative,

City and Montauk) practically 
inevitable. The film is, I 
believe, meritorious of study in 
the technical realm, but never 
did I get the feeling that he was 
practicing technical expertise 
for its own sake. 

As was implied above. this 
film is not an elaborate Berg-
manesque allegory, nor a 
Truffautian humanist lesson. 
but an honest exploration of the 
human dilemma . Although 
Allen has many thematic 
predecessors, perhaps the most 
important is Leo Tolstoy. This 
film is about the family, the 
essential interactive element of 
any society. Allen sometimes 
succumbs to his self-avowed 
tendency to present characters 
whose lives and characteristics 
may be summed up in one 
sentence . Consequently . his 
characters are somewhat one· 
dimensional. but this problem 
is mitigated by a wise move: 
sticking to persons of which he 
knows something in depth . 
artists, would-be artists . 
parents , children and lovers . 

There is no strict plot-line as 
such ; the characters are 
merely defined and allowed to 
interact.

The actinl is superb. It could 
hardly be otherwise, as all of 
the actors are certainly subject 
to lI)any of the same pressures 
as are the characters they 
portray. The cast does have 
some problems with the lan-
guage; the dialogue is loaded 
with Alien-isms. Snideness 
runs rampant. "or whats" and 
numerous questioning aph-
orisms sometimes give the 
impression that all one is seeing 
is Allen talking to himself. This 
may indeed be the case, but 
deeply sympathetic actlDi by 
the likes of E.G. Marshall and 
Geraldine Pale puts Allellil£ck 
in the background where be 
belongs; the rest of the casting 
is so damned accura&e that one 
realizes that the actors are 
speaking the lines themselves, 
even if they didn't realize it 
before they learned them. 

If you're looking for cheap 
suspense, cynical social com-
mentary , ineffectual but en-
dearing Don Juans or anything 
of that kind . don ' t go to 
Interiors. All one finds here are 
many of the hallmarks of great 
literature : true heroism , 
human agony , jealousy, pride 
and love . The heroism is 
unassuming. the agony largely 
self·induced. the jealousy and 
pride products of familial 
tension . the love scarce . 
Interiors is neither thesis nor 
antithesis : it is a sHce of life.

Hardly a bead-turner as it is,

Good CO Me is stin a nice solo 
album, and blessedly without 
pomp. Unlike most other 
progressive rock albums, the 
rhythms are jazzier, the chord 
progressions more challeng-
ing, the time signatures un-
danceable (hurray!) , and the 
musicianship is no-nonsense. 
Bruford's drumwork is mus-
cular and concise, much better 
integrated into the ensemble 
fabric than a lot of other hot-
shot blowhards. Allan Holds-
worth's guitarwork is intuitive

Harriers Top 
Three, All 
Improve Time 

UCSD's Cross Country squad 
overwhelmed three other 
teams last Saturday to win 
their first quadrangular meet 
of the season. Placing their top 
six in the first ten finishers the 
Tritons with 25 points finished 
ahead of second place Whittier, 
41 , CSU Domin,uez Hills, 86, 
and L.A. Baptist, 100. 

The best word to describe the 
harrier 's performance was 
improvement. Every member 
of the team improved their 
times over last weekend's AII-
Cal Meet. Leading the way was 
Doug Jacobson with a 29:04 
time for the 5 mile course, 
improving his previous per-
formance by 11 seconds. Also 
placing for the Tritons were 
Peter Dolan (29 : 19) , Pat 
Morton (29: 54) , Tim Helms 
(30 : 28) and Jon Halperin 
(30: 38) . Jeff Steinhart, Wayne 
Martin and .Tom Grimm fin· 
ished in a pack, 8th , 9th and 
lOth . Overall winner of the race 
was Whittier's Dennis Fort-
hoifer in 28: 16 . 

Coach Andy Skief was "ex-
tremely pleased " with his 
team's performance . Skief 
mentioned two key things about 
his team: depth and improve· 
ment. (please turn &0 page 10)

against UC Riverside on Friday 
for a berth in the semi·finals. 
Greg Lyons had a hat trick and 
Peter Matz headed in a corner-
kick to romp over Riverside4-2. 

" They scored first and gave 
us a scare," said coach Stewart 
Hayes. "The defense just had 
the jitters in that first game." 
The backs apparently re-
covered. only allowing one 
more late-game goal. 

[n the Saturday semi-finals, 
the Tritons fell to Berkeley 3-1 
after "giving them a scare." 
The Bears scored late in the 
first half to take a l"{) halftime 
lead, but a goal off Pete Malz' 
al'm in the final period tied the 
score at one apiece. The " more 
athletic, physically bigger" 
Berkeley team put UCSD away 
with two more goals in the half. 

More important than the loss. 
said Hayes, "the team had a 
game plan and stuck to it. It 's 
important to carry a tactical 
plan through . The experience 
against stronger teams proves 
we can stay in a game against a 
good team - and maybe even 
win ." 

The Tritons finished their 
Saturday slate by gift wrapping 
a 4~ win for UC Davis in the 
third place game. "The players 

. were just dead . Davis outran 
us," said the Triton coach. 

Weary as the team was, the 
defense wasn' t so tired as to 
lend their opponents a hand. 
Three of the four Davis goals 
were put in by UCSD players on 
defensive blunders.

"Our team has at least 12 

runners who are under 32 
minutes on our home c.ourse. 
With consi!tent improvement 
like we showed against Whittier 
there Is no reason why this 
group of runners can't all be 
under 30 minutes by the end of 
L'Ie Rason," commented Skjef.

Yes Solos 
Help Show 

(CODt from pale 7) 
but well-received. Considering 
the group's (especially Rick 
Wakeman's) attitude toward 
Relayer. it was amazing that 
they played "Gates ... " The 
audience of 18,000 rose to its 
feet during "Starship Troop-
er," still one of the biggest Yes 
rockers. 

Among other high points 
were the solo performances. 

Steve Howe livened the 
audience by playing an acous· 
tic piece that consisted of a 
lengthened version of "the 
Wurm." which appeared on 
The Yes Album . Wakeman 
trudged through his spotlighted 
performance, doing excerpts 
from Six Wives or Henry VIIJ 
a nd Journey to the Centre ofthe 
Earth, dressed in a silver suit 
and cape. Chris Squire offered 
·two solo ventures, the first 
during "Long Distance Run-
around/The Fish" and in a new 
song. "On the Silent Wings of 
Freedom," 

Noticeably absent was any 
material from Going For The 
One until near the end of the set 
when they almost lulled the 
audience asleep with "A-
waken." It was the only 
extended song of the ni,ht, the 
group apparenUy roregoing the 
classic "Close to the Edge." 

The endin& was saved when 
the quintet launched into "Your 
Move/All Good People," cli-
maxing with Anderson's re-
introduction or the band mem-
bers. 

The encore was the pre· 
djctable "Roundabout." per· 
haps one of their best tunes. The 
crowd clapped and sanl along 
in the frenzy that Yes always 
seems to create in their 
audience. 

In all, perrormance was 
good, DOt the best, not the 
wont. Yea presented material

Knoll Key to Past 
(Coal. from "Ie 1) 
the propert}, but was very 
vque in rhJ!ir recommenda-
tions, she said. This year, the 
CbancelloT asked tbe new 
Board to refine the recom-
mendations and to "come up 
witb something specific." 

According to a letter received 
by the University from the 
Museum of Man, W-5 (the 
knoll) is the only, relatively 
undisturbed, sea cliff of its size 
and depth remaining in San 
Diego County. Although other 

such sites exist farther along 
the coast, they occur in dif-
ferent environmental settings 
and can be expected to provide 
different sets of information on 
prebistoric subsistence econo-
mies. Only W-5 has the poten-
tial of telling us why these large 
sites existed on sea cliff 
locations. The museum be-
.lieves that the archaeological 
work which has been conducted 
at the knoll represents only a 
very small sample of the total 
site content. The letter stated 

that burials in particular have 
been encountered throughout 
the site area and acJditional 
human remains can be ex-
pected. 

The racetrack property 
would have no more than a 55 
year lease, "so if in 55 years we 
need the land for academic 
units, we can have it, " ex-
plained Collum. Concerning the 
knoll, she said, "if the campus 
finds a better use for the land, 
the recommendation can be 
withdrawn. " 

Hinton at UC 34 Years 
(CODl. from pale 4) 
and free travel. "I later got the 
job of stage manager," he said, 
"and earned another $10 ." 
About his vaudeville experi-
ences, Hinton vows: • 'I'm going 
to write a book about it 
sometime; the book title will be 
I Helped Kill Vaudeville." 

In 1947 Hinton first began to 
record his songs, starting with 
" Buffalo Boy " and " The 
Barnyard Song." Three years 
later a 78 rpm he did for 
Columbia titled "Old Man 
Atom" received passing in-
terest from the House Un-
American Activities Commit-
tee. Of the more than 19 records 
that Hinton bas recorded over 
the last four decades, one is 

special to him. On it, besides 
the nine songs Hinton sings, is 
RCA-Victor's " How the West 
Was Won " featuring Bing 
Crosby and a duet between Sam 
Hinton and Rosemary Clooney. 
Hinton, however, never met 
Clooney; " our relations were 
solely electronic, " he says. 

While Hinton's relations with 
Clooney may not be personal 
because of the wonders of pre-
recording, his relations with 
the University as an adminis-
trator have been long and 
rewarding, extending back 34 
years. Hinton first worked for 
Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography as director of the 
aquarium, a job he took after a 
stint with the Desert Museum in 

Palm Springs. He came to 
UCSD in 1964 when Revelle 
College first opened. In his 
current post as Campus Direc-
tor of Relations with Schools, 
Hinton foste s cooperation 
between the iversity and the 
Junior colleges and high 
schools of San Diego and 
Imperial Counties. 

Outside of his busy adminis-
. trative schedule and his now 

more infrequent personal 
appearances, Hinton still finds 
time to write a regular Sunday 
feature for the San Diego Union 
called " The Ocean World." 
When he isn 't working, Hinton 
makes his home with his wife of 
38 years in La Jolla .

By Dale Wilkins 
As is evident to most college 

students looking for .. gainful" 
employment, experience 
counts most. Warren College 
offerS an Academic Internship 
Program (AlP) through which 
such experience may be 
gained. 

Open to Warren students of 
junior or senior status, this 
program provides students 
with off-campus field ex -
periences supplementing their 
academic program. Students 
participate in internships 
throughout the county, state 
and country , including work in 
research laboratories. ~ov ­
erument offices, social serv-
ice agencies and newspapers. 

Internships correspond to the 
University quarter system and 
earn academic credit . The 
students are assigned faculty 
advisors to provide guidance 
and an evaluation at the end of 
the students ' work. In addition, 
the students must write an 
analytical report of their 
placement, either of the organi-
zational activities in which they 
served or a particular issue or 
problem their organization 
dealt with. 

Those interested should stop 

by the AlP office at 302 Warren 
Campus. 

••• 
The Warren College Com-

muter Board, established two 
years ago to meet the pro-
gramming and practical needs 
of commuter students at 
Warren, will meet weekly this 
quarter at noon on Fridays in 
405 WC. Among the planned 
events to be discussed are 
Tradition Day and the annual 
semi-formal dance. Meetings 
are open to all interested 
students. 

••• 
In this post-Watergate era, 

renewed interest in the legal 
profession has created an over-
flow of law students. The pre-
law student needs to be aware 
of the different fields open to 
law . The Legal Education 
Advisory Program (LEAP) 
was created to help students 
gain insight into what com-
petencies a student should 
develop in exploring the legal 
profession. 

Throughout the year LEAP 
sponsors lectures featuring 
local attorneys speaking on 
such topics as the juvenile 
crime system an<' environ-
mental, civil, criminal and 
corporate law.
