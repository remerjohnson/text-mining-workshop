Prop. 187 Education 
Ban Blocked 
SAN FRANCISCO -
Enforcement of Proposition 
187's ban on public higher 
education was blocked last 
week by Superior Court Judge 
Stuart Pollack. Pollack, who 
issued a restraining order on 
the proposition the day after it 
was approved by voters, said 
that the recent injunction will 
remain in effect until a lawsuit 
by immigrant rights groups is 
tried in June. Pollack said the 
ban contlicts with a 1982 U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling requiring 
Texas to provide schools for all 
residents. 

Appointment of 
Davis Called 'Flaky' 
DA VIS - Renowned poet 
and former Black Panther 
Angela Davis' appointment to 
the University of California's 
Presidential Chair has drawn 
criticism from Sen. Bill 
Leonard (R-San Bernardino), 
chairman of the Senate 
Republican Caucus. In a letter 
of protest to UC President 
Jack Peltason Leonard wrote, 
" It reminds Americans of 
California's tlaky past at a 
time when we're trying to 
build up our reputation." 
Davis, a UC Santa Cruz 
professor and UCSD alumni, 
was a defendant in the 1972 
Marin County Courthouse 
murder trial , in which she was 
later acquitted. Davis was 
chosen for the position ba ed 
on her ideas about how to 
improve the campus's feminist 
and ethnic studies program.

In both cases, theassailantgained 
entry into the victims' apartments 
by asking to use the phone. Once 
inside, he assaulted them and ran-
sacked their apartments. 

The assaults caused concern for 
some residents in the University City 
area. Many apartment complexes 
circulated fliers alerting residents to 
the situation. 

"We made sure that tenants were 
aware of what was going on and we 
suggested that they always secure 
their windows and doors, especially 
the women," said Shannon Nehus, 
supervisor of the Whispering Pines 
apartment complex on Nobel Drive. 
"We've also been walking the 
grounds more and making sure that 
they are well lit at all times," she 
added. 

The San Diego Police Depart-
ment (SDPD) has identified and ar-
rested a suspect in two hot-prowl 
burglaries and sexual assaults which 
occurred in San Diego county in 
January. The first assault took place 
in the Rancho San Diego area on 
Jan. 16, and the second occurred on 

According to the SDPD, the sus-

Students Swamp Regent Davies' Office 
With Armloads of Anti-Fee-Hike T-Shirts 
Protest: Students callan an 
absent Davies to stop the 
proposed fee increase 
ByTom .... ' 
Associate News Editor 

Approximately 10 students, including several 
members of the Associated Students, tied anti-
fee-hike T-shirts on trees and handed out tliers 
outside of UC Regent John Davies' office in 
downtown San Diego Thursday. 

The protesters said they were sending a signal 
to Davies and other regents that the students will 
not accept the fee increases in Gov. Wilson's 
budget proposal. The regents will discuss the 

budget, which would raise undergraduate student 
fees by at least 10 percent for each of the next four 
years, at this week's meeting at UCSD. 

"We are protesting the fact that fees have gone 
up 135 percent in the past four years," A.S. Lobby 
Director Katie Weatherup said while standing 
outside of Davies' office. "Also, the (mancial aid 
threshold has not been raised, so families that 
probably should quanfy because of rising fees 
cannot qualify now." 

After hanging some of the T-shirts, which were 
collected last week as part of the "Tue the Shirts 
Off Our Backs, But Don't Raise Our Fees" cam-
paign, on trees along Broadway Street, the stu-
dents look three arm loads ofT-shirts to Davies'

A.S. Names 
Wilpitz as 
v.P. External 
APPOINTMENT: Position 
filled following Craig's 
controversial resignation 
By Tom Barkl.y 
Associate News Editor 

Taking on the task of representing UCSD 
students on such volatile issues as the pro-
posed fee hikes and the review of affirma-
tive action, Revelle College junior Damien 
Wilpitz began his job last Monday as the 
new A.S. vice president of external affairs. 

Wilpitz, who was voted in unanimously 
by the A.S. on Feb. 1, fills the position left by 
Jennifer Craig, whose resignation Dec. 15 
was surrounded by controversy over 
unmailed voter-registration cards. 

A.S. Lobby Director Katie Weatherup 
said she was "really delighted" about 
Wilpitz's appointment. "I very strongly sup-
port Damien being in office," she said. "I 
think he is incredibly highly qualified and 
will do a fabulous job, not only in organizing 
the events, but also by being a very positive 
intluence. " 

Weatherup added that Wilpitz will be a 
refreshing change for the office. "There were 
some severe problems with Jennie [Craig), 
one of them being an inability to motivate 
the staff," Weatherup said. "[Wilpitz) is 
great as far as working with people and 
creating a reaJ non-blaming, non-passing-
the-buck atmosphere to work in." 

Wilpitz said he intends to mue. some 
organizational changes in the office. "My 
main goal right now is to get the external 
office up and running at more of an orga-
nized level," he said. "Before it was not very 
organized, and the staff was dwindling." 

Wilpitz added that he would like to in-
crease his staff of 10 to 15 of..20. "The office 
is going through some major reconstruction 
fiaht now. I want to have young staff mem-
bers so that I can have [the changes) passed 
on to next year,Â· he said. 

In addition, Wilpitz said he had a new 
perception of the role the vice president 
should take in the external office. "In the

Scientists Question 
Global Warming Data 
CUMATE: Scripps research finds that clouds 
absorb 15 times more energy than suspected 
By Ben Eleln 
Senior Staff Writer 

Global warming forecasts have 
been based on false climate data, 
according to a new study by UCSD's 
Scripps Institution of Oceanogra-
phy, which found that clouds absorb 
significantly more sunlight than pre-

warming and how their response 
will feed back into the climate sys-

Sponsored by the

before accurate pre-

absorption of uncer-
tain magnitude," the research team 
wrote in Science magazine. "There 
is no obvious explanation for the 
cause of enhanced cloud shortwave 
absorption. " 

After studying satellite and sur-
face measurements of solar radia-
tion at five different geographic lo-
cations, researchers found that 
clouds absorb about 3O-watts-per-
meter-squared of radiation, rather 
than the previous estimate of two-
watts-per-meter-squared. 

This discrepancy could vastly 
change the outcomes of climate re-
search; however, Scripps research-
ers would not speculate on how their 
findings might alter the long-term 
forecasts of global warming. 

"The climate models up to this 
point have not included this effect," 
said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, 
director of the Scripps Center for 
Clouds, Chemistry and Climate. 
"What it means for global warming 
.is still unclear at this time." 

"One of the major uncertainties 
in predicting global warming is how

Scripps researcher Nicholas Gra-
ham. "This process of evaporation 
and precipitation transfers heat from 
the ocean to the atmosphere, caus-
ing global temperatures to rise," 
Graham said. 

The researchers who conducted 
the Scripps study said they are con-
fident that the increase in cloud ab-
sorption is not confined to certain 
geographic regions. "Our finding of 
enhanced cloud shortwave absurp-
tion is also consistent with an earlier 
satellite-surface measurement study 
restricted to the eastern United 
States," the researchers stated in 
Science. 

Scripps scientists were not cer-
tain as to what has caused this in-
crease in sunlight absorption. 

While aerosols are believed to 
increase cloud absorption, research-
ers found that the geographic con-
sistency of this phenomena ruled 
out aerosols as the cause.

EXTERNAL: 
Wilpitz wants staff 
relations to improve 
Continued from pa â¢â¢ 1 ' 
past, the vice president external has 
basically been the overseer and the 
delegator of work, but that has 
clashed with some"f the staff mem-
bers," he.sa.id. "I see [the position) 
as a supervisory role, because the 
working relationship with the staff 
members is really important." 

Wilpitz has worked in the Office 
of External Affairs for the last year. 

,He has been the AS. representative 
to, and vice chairman of, the Stu-
dent Affirmative Action Commit-
tee (SAAC), and will chairthis year's 
University of California Student As-
sociation.(UCSA) Student of Color 
Conference, to be held at UCSD in 
March. 

T-SHIRTS: 
~tudents say, Davies 
IS unresponsIve 
Continued from pal. 1 
office. 

"His secretary went back and 
spoke to 'someone' for five minutes 
and then informed us that he was not 
in," said Weatherup, who added that 
she believes Davies was there. 

On Friday, Davies, who said he 
was in Sacramento during the dem-
onstration, called the T-shirt cam-
paign "clever." "I'm sorry I missed 
[the T-shirt hanging]," he added. 

"We always do as much as we 
can to keep [fees) from rising, of 
course," Davies said. "But the ques-
tion is what can we do? If [the leg-
islature) will give us more money, 
fine." 

"The only thing that students 
make a mistake in thinking is that all 
of the burden of the budget prob-
lems fall on them, and that's just not 
true," Davies said, adding that fac-

UCSD representative to the 
UCSA Naomi Falk said that Wilpitz 
is "more than qualified" forthe post. 
"He is very versed in all the issues 
- he knows affirmative action, he 
knows about the budget," Falk said. 
"He's kind of a newcomer, but he's 
picked up things really fast. I think 
we're really lucky to have gOllen 
him." 

Falk said she believes that given 
his experience in lobbying and or-
ganizing campaigns, Wilpitz will 
make the A.S. more active. She 
added that unlike Craig, whom she 
called "incompetent," Wilpitz is 
highly organized and able. "The of-
fice has been more productive in the 
last few weeks than it has [been) all 
year," Falk said. 

"[Wilpitz) has managed to orga-
nize the staff in a way which had not 
been done previously," Falk added. 
"Everyone at the office is working 

ully and staff have shared the bur-
den. The proposed budget would 
increase faculty salaries by three 
percent this year, 7.S percent below 
average, and seeks to attain the av-
erage salary level in four years. Staff 
salaries would increase 1.5 percent. 

Weatherup said that the regents 
had accepted the fee increase early, 
despite their promise to only raise 
fees as a last resort. "The legislative 
budget has not come out yet, so in 
discussing raising fees at this point 
[the regents) are basically sending a 
message to the legislators that they 
don't need to fund higher educa-
tion," she said. 

The protesters said they were 
also trying to provoke Davies to 
become more responsive as a re-
gent. According to Weatherup, 
Davies never returns students' phone 
calls. 

Naomi Falk, UCSD's represen-
tative to the University of Califor-
niaStudentA5Sociation(UCSA)and 
last year's A.S.lobby director, said 
that she has attempted to meet with 

The UCSD Guardian 

together, and things are running very 
smoothly." 

"I don't want to downplay the 
role other people have played, but 
Damien has been able to oversee 
everything," Falk added. 

Wilpitz's term will last only a 
few months, ending after the AS 
elections in May. "Because it's al-
ready so late in the year, I want to go 
ahead with present projects such as 
the regents forum and the shirt 
drive," he said. 

According to Weatherup, 
Wilpitz's short term will make it 
difficult for him to make his mark. 
"He's stepping in the middle of ev-
erythingall being established, so his 
role is shifting," she said. "I think 
it's going to be difficult for him to 
redefine his role in the middle of the 
quarter. If anyone can do anything 
in that brief amount of time, I think 
Damien can." 

Davies many times in the last two 
years. "He won' t return my calls, he 
won't return my letters," Falk said. 
She added that, in contrast, Regent 
Burgener, who also lives in the San 
Diego area, "has made every effort 
to be accessible." 

"Davies represents a constitu-
encyoflS0,OOOstudents," Falksaid. 
"I would think that to accurately 
represent them, he would need to 
meet with them once in awhile." 

However, Davies denies the ac-
cusation that he has not been re-
sponsive. "If the students have called 
me at my office at the right num-
bers, I've returned any student calls 
I've had," he said. 

The protest was part of a week-
long anli-fee-hike campaign orga-
nized by the A.S. and UCSA, build-
ing up 10 the regents meeting, on 
Thursday. 

The protests will culminate with 
"UCSD Unplugged," an all-night 
anti-fee-hike concert, beginning 
Wednesday evening at 4 p.m. on the 
Price Center lawn.

4 OPINION 

WHAT THE 
EDUCATORS SAY 

Jnteniewsbyinna Yaisman, OPINION EDITOR 
AND Brent Johnson, STAFF WRITER 
Has U.S. education fallen behind that of other 

industrialized nations? The Guardian asks several 
UCSD educators to evaluate the quality of Ameri-
can education. 
AnnCr.., 
PrOYost, EI ....... Roosey.1t CoIl.,. 

Certainly, a number of national studies suggest 
that there are declines [in U.S. education], and that 
those declir.es are reflected in more narrow and 
more limited preparation for our students - less 
knowledge of geography, more limited vo-
cabularies, reduced writing abilities, re-
duced critical thinking skills. And then, 
the studies are less clear [about] 
whether there's been a decline in U.S. 
education or whether .. . we are less 
well-off, comparatively, than we used 
to be .. .. 

Ithink that what seems pretty clear 
from those studies is that if the United 
States, and if students in the United 
States, want to be in a position to com-
pete in a global market, they need to 
adopt different attitudes toward get-
ting their own education. And 
school systems need to think of 
preparing their students to work 
in a world where they will be 
working with people from 
other countries who have 
been prepared in different 
ways than our stu-
dents ... . 

The federal govern-
ment.. . has been wor-
ried about that. [It has] 
tended to be worried 
about it in selective issue 
areas, so that after Sputnik, we 
all worried about science training, 
and now, everyone's worried about 
computer literacy and the informa-
tion superhighway and that kind of 
technological preparation .... 

I think that what the studies have 
shown is that students in other coun-
tries test better than our students do, 
or seem to perform at higher levels than 
our students do, on the measurements that the 
studies are employing. That's not the same thing as 
saying that those educational systems are "better 
than" our educational system, but there are things 
that other educational systems around the world do 
differently than we do. They have often more disci-
plined classrooms. They have fixed curriculum .... 
The total number of student contact hours in school 
in Japan is [much higher] than it is in the United 
States. Some other school systems give less room to 
student development, to experiential learning, to cre-
ative activities that aren't then measured in the same 
way by these tests. I'm not indicating by this listing 
that those are positive features of the other systems, 
but just that they create a different kind of learning 
environment that then tests better [than that of the 
United States] .... 

We [American educators] encourage our students 
to be broadly curious .... And 1'10 committed to en-
couraging young people between the ages of 18-22 
to see that ... there's this marvelous smorgasbord of 
subjects out there that you could learn about in a 
focused way now, and be curious about for the rest 

. of your lifetime. And so we have the possibility of 
producing intellectually broader, more curious and 
more engaged citizens than other school systems 
that start specializing and tracking .. . at an earlier 
time.... . 

At UCSD, we can encourage students to be in-
volved in research projects as undergraduates. We 
require them, through the college system, to get a 
broad liberal arts education and not just a special-

CRISIS 

(And Doesn't Give a Damn) 

WE HAVE LOST OUR EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIES 
BJPeterCbang, CONTRIBUTI NG OPIN ION WR ITER 

"Mom, could you read my diploma to 
me again?" 

This running joke between a friend and 
me surfaces whenever we hear of yet an-
other failure of our education system, and 
it never fails to elicit hearty chortles. Yet, 
beneath our mirth lies the sobering real-
ization that we cannot survive as a soci-
ety if we perpetuate the dismal state of 
affairs which the educational status quo 
has bestowed upon us. 

Damning evidence of educational in-
competence abounds: A 1990 release from 
the National Center for Educational Sta-
tistics (NCES) reported that 16 percent of 
17-year-old students fall below the level 
called "indeterminate" in the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress 
(NAEP) reading test. In most cases, these 
students are functionally illiterate, unable 
to deal with even moderately complex 
documents like instruction manuals. Ac-
cording to the NAEP, fewer than one in 
three of these 17-year-olds could place the 
Civil War in the correct half-century of its 
occurrence. Fewer than 60 percent could 

correctly answer the question: "A hockey 
team won five of its 20 games. What per-
cent of the games did it win?" In addition, 
age does not improve the situation: Fewer 
than 40 percent of 25-year-olds can com-
prehend the main idea of a newspaper ar-
ticle, 44 percent cannot understand a 
"help-wanted" ad well enough to match 
their qualifications with the job require-

ments and 22 percent cannot address a let-
ter well enough to ensure that the post of-
fice can deliver it. Even a college educa-
tion offers no shelter against ignorance: 
Fewer than 30 percent of college gradu-
ates know that John Major is the prime 
minister of England and 78 percent can-
not identify the line of succession to the

UNIVERSITY SHOULD NOT PROMOTE ANY SINGLE RELIGION 
Editor: 

After attending the UCSD gos-
pel choir concert at RIMAC on Jan. 
t 8, we were appalled to see univer-
sity money used to pay for a perfor-
mance that was religious in nature. 
We do not mean to say that the study 
of religiouS music should not be part 
of the curriculum at UCSD. How-
ever, it should be done in a manner 
which does not encourage or pro-
mote religion. 

At the concert, the choir sang 
songs decidedly Christian in nature. 
In the middle. of the concert, there 
was a to-minute sermon by a guest 
singer who belonged to a local con-
gregation. The sermon contained 
many references to Christ and en-
dorsed Christianity as the one and 
only religion which is acceptable.

while you ' re here, through college 
governance and involvement in or-

tage of being at UCSD ... is that it's 
a big university, so your choices are 
greater. We have more courses to 
choose from within departments, 
more departments to choose from 
within the university, more diverse 
students to get to know. So ... by 
class and ethnicity and age, [it is] a 
less specialized kind of student 
body. And in that sense, you have 

If the university really wants to 
promote multiculturalism, would it 
not be better to offer a two-unit class 
each quarter which would study the 
musical heritage of many different 
cultures and races from all parts of 
the world in a secular manner? This 
way, the school would not be pro-
moting anyone religion, which is a 
blatant violation of the First Amend-
ment and a waste of student fees.

In my experience as a professor, 
there really has been no decline [in 
U.S. education]. I once received a 
survey asking me how much, in my 
opinion, had student writing skills 
deteriorated. The choices they gave 
me ranged from "a lot" to "cata-
strophic levels." I really don 't think 
education has deteriorated. For ex-
ample, writing skills, mechanically, 
seem to have remained at about the 
same level as in years before. How-
ever, Ithink the quality of logic and

argument may have risen. Overall, 
I think the quality of education has 
risen. 

My hunch [about why test scores 
are falling] is that there is a change 
in the proportion of people taking 
the test [S.A.T.]. There are probably 
people who are taking the tests who 
would not have taken them in pre-
vious years. I would think this is 
happening because we have made 
college so important in obtaining a 
good life. Those who would be 
farmers [in the past] are now in col-
lege. Also, I'm sure that if you look 
at the top scores of the tests, they 
are probably not much different 
when compared to earlier scores. 
When people talk about lower test 
scores, I think they are looking at 
the mean .... 

scything analysis. 
Allow me to synopsize her article 

for those who did not have the plea-
sure of perusing it. She calls for a 
new paradigm in academic profun-
dity. There should be a higher stan-
dard for the tomes of academia than 
for the plebeian of pedestrian soci-
ety. She would spray fungicide on 
the toad stools of political scientists 
who wallow in the perquisites of the 
old paradigm. Those purveyors of 
obfuscation must be banished from 
their ivory towers before they cover 
the walls with the filth of their own 
lugubrious denunciations. 

These calls for a coup d'etat of 
the old regime have some serious 
flaws. First, she accuses academi-
cians of using eccentric vocable in 
order to be ambiguas in vulgam 

Many nations have a rigid na-
tional exam that determines what 
further education or training a per-
son will receive. I used to think 
these exams were very inflexible. 
When I was in Taiwan, they had 
these wonderful geography books 
that were never opened because ge-
ography wasn ' t on the exam. 1 felt 
that this kind of education stifled 
creativity. Now, I think perhaps ex-
ams motivate people toward social 
advancement, especially when their 
position in society is at stake. People 
really crack down when their futures 
are in question. 

I don ' t think that U.S. schools 
are necessarily beller [than those 
in other countries] , but we do have 
a lot of advantages. U.S. schools 
have more money available to 

spargere voces. This is ludicrous. 
Secondly, Lind claims that these 
platitudinarians are actively stymie-
ing the academic aspirations of the 4 
harbingers of the new paradigm. 
Personally, I consider this attack on 
the moral rectitude of scientists to 
be unconscionable. Finally, how can 
any good American denounce fel-
low citizens for being politically 
active? I find this to be the most fal-
lacious of all her failings. 

II is the actions of these few dis-
gruntled malcontents which is un-
dermining the truly glorious path 
which academia has blazed for all 
mankind to follow. Let us name this 
kind of acrimony the 'Li nd 
Lubriderm' and outlaw it from the 
lugubrious paradigm.

them, and the government supports 
our schools with government re-
search grants. Also, I think our sys-
tem encourages a friendly compe-
tition for quality. All schools want 
the best students and faculty. This 
is not necessarily true in other 
countries. When I was in China, I 
fell that [its] universities were ba-
sically the same throughout the 
country. Of course, this isn 't al-
ways the case for all foreign 
schools. But in general, schools 
outside the [United States] just 
don 't seem as vital. 

I think U.S. schools in general, 
and UCSD in particular, offer great 
educations in major research univer-
sities, whereas sometimes in other 
countries - and even in so me

BULLS EYE TAVERN 
PORTE:R~S PUB 

I have finally reached the pinnacle of journalism, the loftiest of goals sought by all those who toil for this newspa-per: I got paid to drink beer. That's 
right, in its continuing quest to bring UCSD 
students the finest in hard-hitting, investiga-
tive reports, the power.;-that-be at the Guard-
ian have seen fit to send me to our campus' 
two pubs, Bulls Eye and Porter's, so that I 
may enlighten you as to the differences be-
tween the two establishments. 

This was not a responsibility that I took 
lightly. And if this quest for journalistic in-
tegrity forced me to quaff five or six pints al 
each location before I could pass judgement, 
Ihen that was the price I would have to pay. 
Sometimes we reporter.; must be prepared to 
make these kinds of sacrifices. 

With responsibility weighing heavily on 
my mind, my companion and I set out for the 
Bulls Eye Tavern, conveniently located at 
the heart of the Price Center. The Bulls Eye 
also serves as the local Round Table pizza 
outlet so thaI patrons can satiate their gnaw-
ing hunger while quenching their thir.;t. In 
addition to pizza, the establishment serves 
deli sandwiches - turkey, pastrami, meat-
ball and something claiming to be an egg-
plant sandwich. I can honestly say that I have 
never considered eggplant an essential part 
of the delicatessen experience. 

But the sandwiches are beside the point. 
The beer is the poi nt. Aside from some mass-
brewed, pedestrian (read: girlie-man) Ameri-
can beer.;, the Bulls Eye offer.; such delec-
table selections as Samuel Adams Boston 
Lager, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, McNally's

BEER: Strauss' 
Amber Lager is the 
nectar of the gods 
Continued from paCe â¢ 

what was on tap and immediately 
perked up when he announced that 
the pub indeed had Karl Strauss' 
Amber ~&er. 

Strauss' is the golden nectar of 
the gods without which life on this 
planet could not survive. So with 
memories of orgasmic colors 
quickly fading, we sat down and 
started in on the flagons. (Editor's 
note: Bulls Eye has also startedserv-
ing this delectable brew.) 

My friend chose a particularly 
nasty concoction called the Solana 
Beach Brewery Special, which con-
tained, in its tiny little half-pint glass, 
more alcohol than three Liquor 
Barns combined. Apparently, you 
can achieve the same effect, at only 
half the price, by simply asking the 
Porter's bartenders to hit you over 
the head with their baseball bat. The 
half-pint of the Solana Beach cost 
$2.25, while my full pint of Strauss' 
cost the same. The pub had 19 
choices on tap, with prices in the 
$2.00 to $3.00 range. 

pened to buy one. Immediately after our potato 
skins were served, we ordered hot 
wings which arrived much quicker 

Other than the bathroom snafu, 

and went nicely with 
our second beers, a 
Bass Ale and a 
Newcastle Brown 
Ale. 

Of course, by 
now it was lime for 
the all-important 
restroom inspection. 
And what a shock it 
was to find that the 
bathrooms were off 
limits, located in a 
room adjoining the 
pub which some 
graduate students 
had decided to close 
offfortheirown use. 

Frankly, I was 
shocked, and not just 
because Porter's ac-
tually allows gradu-
ate students on its 
premises. As a result, 
bar patrons were 
forced to leave the 
building and conduct 
their business in the 
Student Center bath-
rooms.

Specials and re-
alize that you ' re 
in no danger of 
being crushed by 
falling giant 
darts. But again, 
this wholeambi-
ence thing is 
relative. 

Having sampled the brew, we 
decided to confront the menu, which 
fealured sandwiches with names 
such as the Holey Gobbler (turkey 
and swiss) and the Bigass Bronto 
(deluxe veggie), as well as potato 
skins and hot wi ngs. We ordered the 
skins and were told that they would 
be slow cooked.

bar to sit at and maybe a dozen 
tables scattered around the floor. 
The walls are covered with standard 
beer advertisements as well as some 
artwork that was made either by 
preschool students or some unusu-

ally talented VA majors. 

While waiting for the employees 
to grow the potatoes, we addressed 
the pub's ambience. It was a wel-
come change from Bulls Eye's fake 

And instead of a dart board on 
the ceiling, there's one in the comer,

Tritons 
Spiked By 
L.B., USC 
WINLESS: UCSD stilI 

unabl~ to pick up first 
win of tough season 
By Jeremy Malamed 
Staff Writer 

The rigors of being the only non-
scholarship team in the toughest 
volleyball conference in the nation 

are starting to take 
their toll on the 
UCSD men's vol-
leyball team. 

PUlling in 
hard-fought ef-
forts every week 
against top-notch 
opponents, the 
Tritons have only 
one victory in 
their three seasons 

of competing in Division I play. 
One week after taking on the 

number-two team in the nation, 
Stanford, UCSD had no time to rest. 
Conference powers Long Beach 
State and USC came to town and 
handed the Tritons (0-7,0-6 in con-
ference) their sixth and seventh 
losses of the season. 

Friday night 's match featured the 
Long Beach Slate 4gers (4-1, 3-1) 
at RIMAe. The Tritons received a 
big lift with the return of junior 
blocker Mati Minehann. But even 
with Minchann in the lineup, UCSD 
couldn't match up with the talented 
4ger squad. Long Beach left town 
with a four set victory: 15-10, 15-
to, 11-15,15-5. 

Triton Ed McMahon had an im-
pressive match anyway, spiking 
down a game high 23 kills and re-
cording six digs. Tom Black contin-
ued his strong play with 21 kills. 

Saturday night brought the USC 
Trojans (5-t, 2-1) to town, and the 
game didn't turn out any better for 
the Tritons. They got down early and 
struggled to gain momentum against 
the strengths of the Trojans. 

USC, led by Jason Muholland's 
16 kills, swept the match, 15-5, IS-
5,15-12. The Trojans got strong play 
from outside-hitter Russell Brock, 
who slammed down 11 kills to go 
along with five digs. On the UCSD 
side, Tyson Kerr nailed down a 
game-leading 18 kills in the match. 

SOFTBALL: 
Tritons drop first two 
ContInued from pace 20 
the game at 1-1. It then put the game 
away, tallying two more runs in the 
first extra inning with a double in 
the leftfield alley - all despite an 
amazing grounder grab by 
Stephany. 

In game two, UCSD's other ace, 
Shannon Mounger (0-1), took to the 
mound and provided strong pitch-
ing for two innings before giving up 
a run in the third. 

The Triton offense was lulled to 
sleep by the Regals' Heidi Stevens 
(1-1) and could only manage one 
run, even though Alvies (2-3) and 
Schilling (2-3) continued their hot 
hitting. Cal Lutheran exploded in 
the sixth inning for four runs to 
bump the lead to 5-1, and it proved 
to be too much for UCSD. 

"I feel that this year is definitely 
a continuation from last [year 's late 
success)," Gerkens said.

Tritons Avenge Loss 
To Leopards, 94-74 
PAYBACK: UCSD got a key win against La 
Verne, avenging a loss earlier this season

least . No 
where was 
this more 
evident than 
on Friday 
night, when 
the Tritons 
played an 
average first 
half before 
absolutely 
dismantling 
La Verne. 

"That was the best half of bas-
ketball we've ever played," Head 
Coach Judy Malone said. "Every-
thing was going our way." 

Mter battling to a virtual stale-
mate in the opening half of the 
match-up (La Verne led 42-41), 
UCSD came out in the second and 
blew the Leopards off the court, 
outscoring La Verne by a mon-
strous 20 points. 

Heading up the Triton charge, 
po int guard Cindy Yamasaki 

poured in 22 points including a six 
for 12 evening from beyond the 
three-point arc. UCSD's numbers 
were impressive on all fronts. 

The Tritons shot 57 percent in 
the second half and 48 percent in 
the game from the field and were 
almost as good from three-point 
land, posting a 44 percent mark by 
hitting on 13 of 29 attempts. 

"In the second half they played 
~s in a zone and we ran our zone 
offense to perfection," Malone said. 
"We just kept moving the ball until 
we got an open shot. In the last six 
minutes, we didn't miss I shot." 

Among the statistical leaders for 
UCSD were senior forward Tami 
Oviatt who tallied 15 points and 
pulled down nine rebounds. Guard 
Marcia Jeffries contributed with 11 
points while forward Stacy Patsko 
notched 10 points and 10 rebounds. 

The 94-74 shellacking contin-
ued a UCSD trend of second half 
combacks that has persisted during 
its current six-game winning streak. 

"That was a must win game for 
us and we came through," Malone 
said. "We are starti ng to peak at the 
right time." . 

Highlanders Can't 
Keep Pace with UCSD 
LOW ROAD: Tritons open season on the links 
with 302-311 victory over UC Riverside 
By Tedd Ladd 
Associate Sports Editor 

You know you've got a good 
team when your sixth man is a 
medalist - and you don ' t even 

need your top 
man 's score. 

That's 
what hap-
pened to the 
UCSD golf 
squad at last 
Thursday'S 
dual match 
with UCRiv-
erside. Play-
ing on the 

traditional grounds of the Victoria 
Golf Club, the Tritons crushed the 
Highlanders, 302 to 311. 

"If we shoot 7's individually 
and low 300s as a team, then 
we ' re right where we need to be," 
UCSD Coach Mike Wydra said. 

Sixth man Arnie Campbell and 

Color 99"" Of) Copies ,. 8,,11 

teammate Jim O'Grady led the way 
for the Tritons, each medaling and 
shooting a low 74 - only two ov.~r 
par - on the course. 

On the 15th hole, a 536-yard 
par-five monster, O'Grady showed 
his remarkable strength by pound-
ing a drive 332 yards into the wind. 

"[O'Grady 1 is the longest hiller 
in the nation for Division III right 
now," Wydra said. "He hits 280 
yards on a bad drive - about 330 
on a good one." 

Co-captain Pete Roberts, who 
was ranked fifth in the nation as a 
sophomore, and Alex Behrend also 
doubled up with a pair of solid 77s 
for the UCSD cause. 

Tom Brown, the Tritons' top 
man going into the match, shot a 
respectable 79, while Brian Walter 
wasn't far behind with an 82. How-
ever, both their scores were dis-
counted since each school takes its 
top-four results only.

Pt. Loma Bounces UCSD 
CRUSADERS: Tritons 
unable to continue win 
streak in Pt. Lorna loss

Associate Sports Editor 

One minute you're on top of the 
world, and the next minute some-

BRLL 

neath you. 
That's how 

it was for the 
UCSD men's 
basketball 
team after 
Thursday's 
game against 
Point Loma at 
RIMAC. 

The Tri-
tons (10-12) 
were riding a 

three-game win streak coming into 
the contest against the Crusaders 
(11-13), but left with a 98-88 defeat. 

And with only three more games 
remaining on its schedule, UCSD's 
"Quest for a .500 Record" may be 
stalled, but it's still alive. 

The Crusaders - and particu-
larly Beau Pack (26 points) - had 
the hot hand all night, lighting up 
the scoreboard with a sizzling .571 
shooting percentage for the game. 

Miserable 5-17 (.294) three-
point shooting hurt the Tritons in the 
first half, and their inside shooting 
was also a frigid 18-42 (.428). 

There were some bright spots for 
UCSD, however. Kahlil Allen was 
the most efficient scorer for the Tri-
tons. In only 22 minutes, Allen tal-
li.ed 21 points and five rebounds. 

UCSD center Mall Aune (14 
points, six rebounds) and teammate 
Matt Minehan (13 points, five re-
bounds) also kept the Tritons close, 
with a slim halftime deficit, 49-43. 

In the second half, the Tritons 
narrowed the margin but couldn't 
take the lead. Point Loma hit 10-20 
treys to extend its lead. 

Solid contributions from Todd 
Benelar (11 points) and Jason Jones 
(10 points), still couldn ' t save 
UCSD from the Crusader onslaught. 

When it was over, the Tritons had 
four players in double-digits in the 
"total poi nts" column, but also a 
tough 98-88 loss. Victory was Just out of reach for Brian Capella and the Tritons.

UCSD Masters TMe 
DOUBLED-UP: UCSD swept Master's College on Saturday 
By Sean Rahlml 
Guardian Reporter 

The UCSD baseball' team looked to up its 
record to 4-0 on Saturday afternoon, wilh the 

, help of a couple of soulh-
paw hurlers. Sieve Heighl 
and Ryan Ward came 
Ihrough in a big way, as 
the Tritons swept a 
double-header from Ihe 
Muslangs of Master's 
College, 11-2 and 4-0. 

Steve Height (2-0) 
pitched a terrific game in 
the opener, allowing only 
Ihree hits and two runs, 
while striking out six in 

seven innings of work. 
The 'Triton offense exploded early on with 

seven runs in the first inning to open up an 
insurmountable lead. The Mustang's starter 
Mark Balch, lasted just one-third of an inning. 

Eric Quandt (3-5, 2 RBI) collected three 
hits in his first three al bats, Combined with a 
4-4 performance in the Tritons' previous game 
against Southern California College, Quandt 
connected in seven conseculive plate appear-
ances. 

"[Quandt] is our sparkplug on offense. For 
us to be successful, we need him to be on his 
game. He was definitely on today," Head 
Coach Robert Fletcher said. 

Dan O'Brien was the star of the first game 
for UCSD, going four for five with a double 
and three RBI. His supporting cast included 
Chris Miyaki (2-4, 2 doubles, 3 runs, 2 RBI) 
and AI DelFavero (2 hits; 2 RBI). 

sixth, however, delighting the crowd with a 
towering, opposite-field two-run blast that put 
the Tritons up 10-2. 

"[DelFavero] makes things happen for us," 
Fletcher said. "He is also a big part of our 
defense, which is going to be strong." 

Mike Bryant and David Mullin each came 
out of the pen and pitched a scoreless inning 
to finish off the Mustangs. Miyake ended the 
game in the top of the ninth by snagging a 
hot, infield shot and gunning down the batter 
at first. 

Ryan Ward and Jason Aguilar grabbed the 
headlines in the second game for the Tritons. 
Ward pitched seven scoreless innings, scat-
tering three hits to pick up his second victory 
of the young season. Ward gave up only Ihree 
singles while fanning six and walking just 
one. 

Led by Aguilar (3-3, I run, 1 RBI), the 
Tritons scored four runs and shut down the 
Mustangs offense. 

Aguilar started a firsl-inning rally when 
he got on base wilh a perfect bunt single 
Miyaki then moved him 10 third with a double, 
and DelFavero brought h'im home on a 
blooper which fell between Mustang infield-
ers in shallow right. 

With two outs in the second inning, the . 
Tritons' offense struck again. Quandl and 
Bobby Arban got on base on a walk and an 
error respectively. Aguilar then nailed a blis-
tering single to left that drove Arban in. 
M iyaki 's (2-3, 1 RBI) double to deep left-cen-
ter brought in Quandt to make the score 3-0 
UCSD.

Tritons Topple UC Riverside to Even Season Record at 1-1 
HIGH AND DRY: The UCSD men's tennis team got its inaugural shot at a Division III opponent on Saturday and took full 
advantage, sweeping the doubles matches in its first home contest and knocking off the Highlanders by a score of 5-2 
By Hilary Somers 
Guardian Reporter 

Following two consecutive 
weekends of intense tennis action 
against Division I opponents at the 

University of San 
Diego, the UCsD 
men's tennis team 
was looking for-
ward to playing 
against a fellow 
Division III com-
petitor. 

On Friday, tra-
ditional Triton ri-
val California 

Lutheran University came to town 
and provided just the chance UCSD 
had been eagerly awaiting. 

The Tritons took full advantage, 
playing the part of the rude host and 
earning their first triumph of the 
season by a 5-2 tally to even their 
record at 1-1. 

UCSD looked especially impres-
sive in the doubles matches, win-
ning all three to clinch its initial vic-
tory. 

The number-three tandem of 
Ping Yeh and Ari Marken led the 
way for the Tritons, squashing their 
opponents in a pro set by an 8-2

20 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian Monday, February 13, 1995 

KHHFTV 
DAN KRAFT 

You Want 
Mike who? 

I've never been one to 
suspect that anybody con-
nected to the world of boxing 
was sane. But recently I have 
become even more convinced 
that they should all be locked 
away in some place miles from 
civilization with the words 
"Shady Acres" in its title. 

UCSD Crusade Marches On 

Why? Well, it's really very 
simple. Every heavyweight 
champion and contender 
insists he is waiting for "Iron" 
Mike Tyson to get out of jail so 
he can get his shot at him. 

Now I ask you, who in his 
right mind would want to fight 
"Iron" Mike? To me, this 

T seems to counter every 
survival instinct cultivated in 
the history of man. After all, 
Mike only needs one "shot" to 
ensure that most men will 
nev'er date again. 

How quickly the world has 
forgotten the havoc that Mr. 
Tyson reeked upon the bodies 
- and faces - of his unwor-
thy opponents! So James 
"Blimp" Douglas got lucky. 
Has that bit of quickly 
forgotten luck caused everyone 
on the planet to neglect what 
happened to Leon Spinks or 
Larry Holmes. Indeed, those 
fights could be summed up in 
one word: "Ouch!" 

PERFECT: The Tritons continued their early 
season hot-streak, downing Pt. Lorna, 7-2 
By Dan Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

It 's been that kind of season for 
the UCSD women 's tennis team 
(3-0) - the Tritons prevailed over 

visiting NAIA 
opponent Point 
Loma at the 
Spanos courts on 
Friday, 7-2, and 
the team consid-
ered it to be a 
relatively close 
match. 

"In the past 
. [Point Loma} has 

not been very strong," UCSD 
- Coach Liz laPlante said. "They 

were surprisingly good, and had 
more depth than we expected." 

In the beginning, PI. Lorna 
made things interesting. Its top-
ranked doubles team of Laura 
Mintz and Marni Hunt managed 
to best UCSD's dynamic duo of 
Michelle Malephansakul and Su-
san Drage, 8-4. Point Loma had 
little time to savor the victory, 
however, as the incredibly deep 
Triton lineup then proceeded to 
dismantle the visitors in methodi-
cal fashion . 

Walker and Jamie Esperon. 
In the other doubles contest, 

Morgan Gessford and Hilary 
Somers, playing their first match 
together, beat cara Overstreet and 
Kana Biehl by an identical 8-3 
tally. . 

Malephansakul suffered her 
first singles loss of the year at the 
number-one singles spot, where 
Hunt won 6-1, 6-0. However, the 
Tritons swept the rest of the 
singles matches. 

Number-two Somers pounded 
Mintz 6-3, 6-1, to maintain a per-
sonal undefeated 3-0 record in 
singles for the season. 

Drage, who is dominating at 
the third slot, dismantled Walker 
6-2, 6-1 . The junior transfer has 
impressed this season, garnering 
an undefeated record of her own 
during the young season. 

The most lopsided victory of 
the day came courtesy of 
Kurokawa, who slapped around 
Esperon en route to a 6-0, 6-0 
bageling at the third slot. 

In fact, if you were one.of 
those suckers that paid to sit 
down in the front row, and you 
happened to sneeze as the 
opening bell was rung, you 
may have missed those fights

ROUGH START: UCSD dropped its first two games of the season in a doubleheader with Cal Lu 

man will be the first to have 
his face fed to him via a strong 
right hook. 

So, why is aging icon 
George Foreman so eager to 
give Tyson the chance to retire 
him? This is one match you 
could'n't pay me to watch. I 
love big George, and the last 
thing I want to see is Mike 
Tyson ending his career by 
beating him to a pulp. 

Obviously, this whole "I 
want Mike Tyson" craze is 
strictly a monetary issue, 
because DO human, not even a 
boxer, ,",ould be so looney as 
to step in the ring with that 
man just for the challenge of it. 

I only pray that Mike's 
probation officer prevents him 
from escaping the friendly 
confines of the big house long 
enough for George to retire.

Blistering fastballs, diving 
catches, bullet throws to first, clutch 
hits, carefully fielded short-hops, 

double-steals 
and sneaky hit-
and-run plays. 

And that 
was just the 
first game of 
the UCSD 
softball team's 
doubleheader 
against arch-ri-
val Cal 
Lutheran on 
Sunday. 

When the 
dust had cleared and all marks were 
penciled on the scorprd, the Tri-
tons had dropped two close contests 
to the Regals, 3-1 and 5-1.

played. [Cal Lu] is a tough squad,"

UCSD Coach Patricia Gerckens 
said. "I really think that this is the 
best team I've ever coached." 

In the first game, the Tritons kept 
the score notched at 0-0 for three 
innings. The UCSD infield held 
firm, aided by shortstop Nora 
Stephany'S nifty scoops and leaping 
stretches by Kristin Schueler at first. 

Triton pitcher Lisa Gil (8 IP, 3 
ER, 2 SO) mowed down Regal hit-
ters with ease - at one point retir-
ing six straight batters - with a 
deceptive change-up, fastball and 
sinker combination. 

"I was very happy with the way 
[Gil] pitched," Gerckens said. "She 
is definitely one of our leaders." 

UCSD drew first blood in the 
fourth inning when Clair AIvies (3-
4,5-7 for the series) ripped a double 
to the left field fence. Kristy 
Schilling followed with â¢ rocket 
single through the infield bole. 

The Tritons then executed a 

swinging double-steal with Alvies 
racing home from third to make the 
score 1-0, UCSD. It was the only 
offense. the Tritons could muster, 

however.
