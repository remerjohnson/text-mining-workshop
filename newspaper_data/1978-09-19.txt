Editorial 
This past summer the Executive Board of the TrUe TimeI 

voted to cbange the name of the paper to The Guardiu . 
Tbe paper is entering its twelfth year of publication. and bas 

evolved tremendously since I ts beginnings in 1966. In its first years 
of publication it was a tentative. beweekly publication funded 
largely by student fee . It has grown to a stable. thrice weekly 
paper that is currently providing the vast bulk of its operating 
revenue from advertising sales. 

The scope of the paper and the coverage it provides has grown as 
the University itself has grown. It is the feeling of the Board that 
the name TrUe Times no longer has the intensity it did ten years 
ago. It no longer reflects the approach and nature the paper has 
now. 

We intend to give quality. incisive coverage to newsworthy 
events that affect this campus community. We intend to provide a 
source of information about many facets of the University. and to 
provide a forum for free expression. 

It is to this end we feel the name The Guardian is better suited. 
We stress continuity from the past issues of the paper. It is still. 
and hopefully always will be. a source of accurate. objective news 
about the University and those happenings that affect it. 

Tbis year there will be some new thiDJs in the paper. We will be 
runDiDJ both news and feature stories from the Associated Press 
Wire Service in order to provide more national and state news that 
bean on the campus and interests of those here. Olipbant. the 
political cartoonist. will be featured regularly. . 

A Friday movie guide letting you know wbat movies are playing 
at what theatres. along with reviews of some of the movies is 
planned. Restaurant c tques. too. 

Uyou see something y udon't like in the paper. let us know. W, 
caa and will experime 'l with the pages. 

The Guardian is pu.tJ l~bed at tlle Univenity of California. San 
Diego as an official (!a!npus newspaper. Publication is Monday.

In June the voters of Cali-

For the Universlty's part.

University officials 88y that

made up if the University is to

source of funds available in 
sufficient amounts. they 88y. 
are student fees. 

Student response to these 
sentiments is. becauae of the 
Summer academic break . 
generally unavailable. How-
ever. Kevin Eckery. wbo 
serv .. on the UC Student Body 
Presidents Council as the 
UCSD representative. when 
reacbed for comment said. 
"We will fight an increase." 

Thougb some officials say 
they suspect students will be 
against any increase in fees. 
these officials say they never· 
theless support the idea. 

Reasons given for the need to 
maintain at least the current 
budget level centers around 
several main points. The major 
reason is the need to keep 
academic salaries competitive 
with other universities . ac-
cording to University ofricials . 

Vice-Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage says 
that though he is sympathetic to 
student protes ts a bout fee 
increases. " If you don ' t keep 
academic salaries up then you 
start loosing some of your top 
performers to Cal Tech. MIT 
and Stanford." 

Armitage says he is not 
optimistic about more money 
coming from the state. " You 
always bave to be ready for 
further cuts once you 're in the 
retrenchment model." he 88YS.

Tbe election that resulted in the 
demise of the AS Senate 
produced a 40% turnout. After 
consideriq the problem, the 
admini.tration decided that the 
election results had been one-
sided enough to allow for the 
dissolution of the government 

Reasons for the collapse of 
the AS Senate bave been 
primarily attributed to prob-

In October, 1972, McElroy 
constituted the Advisory Com-
mJttee on Student Life Inter-
ests, usually abbreviated SLIC. 

The SLIC was composed of 
two represeDtatives from each 
of the colleges (then including 
the just opened Third College) , 
one representative from the 
graduate and medicaistudents, 
and one representative from 
each of the various campus 
ethnic organizations. 

The SLIC, said McElroy, 
would be an advisory body to 
the administration, and its 
recommendations would be 
"duly considered " in the 
administrative decision-mak-
ing process.

W88 constituted. Nine senators, 
one of whom was elected 
President by the student body, 
were entirely responsible for 
the conduct of govemmental 
affairs. These students even-
tually came to be elected as 
representatives of their col-
lege, but Revelle was then the 
only college operating. 

When Muir College appeared 
in the fall of 1961, the senators 
began their college representa-

the AS Senate's next to last 
president, Mike Paldc. Palcie 
was accused of providing jobs 
throuidt the AS for two former 
girl friends, a move which 
caused considerable cont~ 
versy. 

Larry Baker. president of the 
Senate from 1964 to 1966, 
predicted the death of the AS 
Senate in 1968: 

"Elections are still beld,

TIle Uadergrad StudeDt CouDcll 

The SLIC gradually meta-
morphized into The Under-

f raduate Student Council TUSC), with basically the 
same personnel as the SLIC but 
with less overt dependence on 
the Cbancellor. With TUSC, 
mandatory activity fees re-
tumed. 

In January of 1974, TUSC 
began a five-month campaign 
to eliminate itself. With the 
sponsorship of a two-day 
student conference In the 
International Center on Janu-
ary 12 and 13 of that year, rosc 
began studying ways of re-
viving independent student . 
govemment at UCSD. 

After months of study, TUSC 
finally formulated a proJ'f)881 
for a new form of student 
govemment. It held its own 
election in May of 1974 on the 
four campuses (Warren Col-
lege having just been added), 
but just a week after those 
electlons, it offiCially dissolved 
itself. 

The ,overnment TUSC chose 
as its successor was as far 
away from the AS Senate as 
wal humanly pouible. and it 
was also the moat controversial 
of all tbe various student 
governments.

need to complete graduation 
requirements. Just prior to the 
inception of the Coop in June, 
197., she rumJnated on the 
potential of the Coop in a Triton 
Times interview. 

"Studenu here aren't into 
electing people and estab-
lishing a heirarchy," Harris 
said, but she was concemed 
about the OpeD nature of the 
Coop system. "Someone could 
bring in an interest group and 
just wipe out everything ... The 
Coop is ,oniy ,oing to work if 
there is a lot of publicity. " 

Harris's predictions were to 
prove prophetic. When the Coop 
was finally dismantled in 1977, 
one of the major objections to it 
was the ease with which 
pressure groups, particularly 
radical leftists, could pack the 
meetings. 

When the Coop was first 
formed, Marco LiMandri. later 
one of those accused of packing 
meetiqs, wasn't concerned 

in the Coop constitution, and 
also of trying to pack the Coop 
with sympathizers. 

The Coop survived the BRG 
controversy, and immediately 
after the conflict refused to 
adopt a proposal which would 
have provided Cor a codified, 
stricter set of rules of opera-
tion. 

In Spring o( 1975, the Coop 
moved to solve one problem, 
and stem off another. Despite 
the TUSC mandate, and despite 
recognizing itself as the official 
student government in October 
of 1974, tl:'e administration still 
didn 't ~ognize the Coop as the 
official representative of the 
students, 

At the s .. me time, the Coop, 
always leftist, was comin,

for Foulks' dismissal was her 
inability to properly manage 
the day-care center. 

Foulks dismissal came in the 
wake of the intense turmoil that 
errupted over the fate of the 
center Winter quarter when 
Chancellor McElroy announc-
ed plans to possibly bid out 
operation of the center to an 
outside agency. The center had 
be.en operated by the Uni-
versity with funding from the 
State Department of Education 
(SDE), student registration 
monies , CETA funds and 
parent fees . 

The day McElroy announced 
his intention to possibly bid out 
operation of the center, 35 day-
care supporters occupied his 
office for what would be first of 
two such sit-ins, the second 
finally ending in the arrest of 21 
students. 

The first sit-in lasted six 
hours, during which time the 
parents confronted McElroy 
with their feelings that fran-
chising out the center would 
substantially decrease the 
quality of day-care. During the 
meeting McElroy said he would 
ask Michetti to send a letter to 
SDE requesting funding for the 
upcoming year. Subsequently 
the (unding was approved . 
Even with the SDE funds and 
the other sources of income 
there would be a deficit of about 
$18,000 in the center's operating 
budget. 

In order for the center to 
remain o()(1n under University 
control the bud~et deficit had to 
be made up. The Bu.ine •• 
9ffice IOUIbt the mouey from 
the Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs. The 
Advisory Committee's charge 
is to recommend to the Chan-
cellor bow $4_4 million in 
student registration fees should 
be allocated. 

On May 3 the Advisory . 
Committee voted nol to fund the 
center. One week later 100 
persons marched into Mc-
Elroy 's office demanding that 
McElroy overruled the Adviso-
ry committee's decision not to 
fund the center. The supporters 
vowed to remain in McElroy 's 
office until adequate funding 
was found to keep the center 
under University operation. It 
would take them three days and 
two nights in McElroy 's office 
and the arrest of 21 students 
before funding would come. 

The Wednesday the pro-
testors first ' occupied McEl-
roy ' s office the Advisory 
Committee met again at the 
Chancellor's request. McElroy 
issued a statement through 
Advisory Committee co-chair 
Rick Whitehill saying McElroy 
felt a $17,000 subsidy to the 
center would be " unconscion-
ably high," but that he would 
approve it if the committee 
voted to allocate that amount. 

The committee voted a 
motion a sking McElroy to 
appear at the next committee 
meeting to present a proposal 
for funding at a level that he 
found conscionable. The next 
meeting was set for the fol-
lowing Monday morning. By 
the time the meeting occurred 

21 students had been hana. 
cuffed and taken to jail and in 
an informal meeting of the 
committee a $25,000 subsidy 
had been promised. 

At 3 pm Friday, after the 
protestors had been in the 
Chancellor 's office for three 
days , Vice-cbancellor of Ad-
ministrative Affa irs Bt'rnard 
Sisco announced that a 5 pm 
deadline had been set. Either 
the protestors vacated or they 
would be arrested _ 

As the 5 pm dp.adline ap-
proached, the AdviSOry Com-
mjt~ met nearby the Chan-
celior's office in an attempt to 
reach a compromise with the 
protestors to prevent the 
arrests . The committee voted 5 
to 4 - five student members 
for, - four administrators a -
gainst - to fund the center at a 
$25,000 for one year. 

Serena Leyon , a spokes-
person for the protestors : 
refused the one year subsidy, 
saying the protestors desired a 
continuing commitment at the 
$25,000 level. 

Five o ' clock arrived and 
twenty -one protestors re -
mained inside the Chancellor's 
office_ Shortly afterwards they 
were arrested and led hand-
cuffed to waiting police paddy-
wagons with a crowd of about 
500 watching and chanting. 

The following Monda y the 
Advisory Committee met and 
voted to fund the center $25,475. 
Later that afternoon the 
Chancellor approved the a llo-
cation. 

At the same meeting the 
committee created a Day-Care

Parking Crisis May Force Fees Up 
By John Hondrot 
Associa~ News Edl&Or 

Dr_ Freeman Gilbert, Chair-
man of the Parking Alternative 
Task Force, calls the situation 
a "crisis"_ 

The crisis referred to is the 
congested parking conditions 
at University Hospital in the 
Hillcrest area of San Diego. 

The parking problem is so 
severe that in order to alleviate 
it the University could be 
forced to build several multi-
million dollar parking struc-
tures, the cost of which would 
come from student, faculty and 
staff parking fees. . 

Next Monday, the task force 
which Gilbert heads will make 
its final report to Chancellor 
McElroy. 

Before forming the task forte 
McElroy had favored an ad-
ministration plan to build a 700-
car garage in Hillcrest. 

"As far. as I've been told, 
we've gone through every 
possible alternative over the 
past three years, and this is the 
plan considered most viable," 
McElroy said at the time be 
came out in favor of the parking 
structure plan. 

But last spring, after the 
ParkiDl Advisory Committee 
recommended that the alter-
natives be considered before 
plana for a garage and a raise in 
the parking fee were approved, 
McElroy formed the Parking 
Altemative Ta.k Force. 

Source. cloee to the ta.k 
force and the Chancellor say, 
however, that the plan most 
likely to be adopted i. and 
always hal been the bulldlq of 
a parktnc.tructure. 

However, Icconlinl to tbese 
sources, the wort or the taak 

force will still be beneficial 
because more than one struc-
ture will be needed to solve the 
hospital parking problem, and 
the alternatives studied by the 
task force can be implemented 
to supplement the structure_ 

recommend the fee level. " 
Schneider said. 

One option discussed at a task 
force work session beld in late 
August was the plan to con-
struct a concrete parking 
structure at the hospital . The 

- subscription bus service 
- remote pal'king (stadium, 

campus) 
-mass transit 
-carpool, vanpool, taxipooL 
Because of Proposition 13, 

San Diego Transit will have to 

" ... the plan most likely to be adopted is and always 
has been .the building of a parkir-aQ structure ... " 
The plan considered last 

spring to build one structure 
would have raised student 
parking fees from $36 per year 
to $45. Faculty fees would have 
been raised from $72 to $96 and 
staff fees would ha ve gone from 
$60 to '72. 

Sources say that if a parking 
structure is approved, there 
should be rate increases of 
approximately this magnitude 
by Winter quarter. . 

But over the Summer the task 
force has been looking into 
parking alternatives, which if 
implemented could forestall 
the building of a second 
structure and keep the rates 
from golni up again. 

The task force will be pre-
pariDi a report this week which 
prioritizes the parking alter-
native. according to financial , 
social, ecological and political 
factors, said Gilbert. 

Then the final report wiU be 
sent to the Chancellor and to the 
Medical Center ' . planning 
commiliion for evaluation, 
said Andy Schneider of the 
ParkiDl AdvllOry Committee. 

"The talk force will recom-
mend optiODl only; the Parkiq 
Advisory Committee will 

proposed structure would cost 
$4.5 million plus an additional 
$200,000 that may be needed for 
the construction of an access 
road. 

Gilbert said the preferred 
site for the structure is in a 
natural canyon located north-
east of the'medical center. 

"People will feel that it's an 
outrage to build a parking 
structure in a natural canyon , 
but no matter where it's built, 
people will still complain," said 
Gilbert_ 

It was mentioned at the 
workshop that if the University 
is required to do extensive 
landscaping and building 
modification due to environ-
mental impact. the total cost of 
the project could run around ,10 
million. 

Gilbert believes the Uni-
versity " can' t get around not 
buildiDl a parkine structure. 

"If a parkinc structure i.n ' t 
built, the parking situation will 
get real bad-in fact, it already 
I .... Gilbert commented. 

Other options dilcUll8d by 
the ta.k force included: 

- reroutinc bus lines to be 
within walkinc distance 

-orbital bUi crui_r 

operate on a reduced budget 
and as a result, will have to cut 
some of its bus lines, according 
to Gilbert. 

"We' re asking San Diego 
Transit to increase the number 
of bus lines to the medica l 
center- San Diego Tra nsit says 
it's a ' pipe dream ', .. sa id 
Gilbert. 

The orbital bus cru iser option 
could be impl e men ted in 
connection with San Dieg o 
Stadium remote parking or 
without it. There are four bus 
stops that are close, but are not 
within easy walking distance to 
the medical center. The orbital 
bus would _take a route which 
would encompass these stops 
and transport employees to the 
hospital. 

In the beginning, only one van 
would be used_ The estimated 
cost for one van per year is 
'10,000. 

There would be three circu-
lations per hour; 12 circulations 
per day_ At maximum use , 
there would be 14 people on six 
runs, which would amount to 90 
people , so the orbital bus 
cruiser would free 90 spaces. 

Task force members aereed 
at the work session that varyine 
Ibilt Ume. would make the 

subscription bus service option 
almost impossible, unless the 
busses made runs down the 
different freeways . 

The cost for an Aztec Line 51-
passenger bus would be $21 an 
hour, which includes driver and 
gas. It would have to be used a 
minimum of four hours a day. 
This would amount to $21 ,840 
per year. 

It was estimated that pos-
sibly 100 parking spaces could 
be saved, tbough this was hard 
to guarantee because of the 
varying shift times in operation 
at the hospital. 

To pay for the service, eithe r 
subscription s o r s ubsidies 
would have to b e use d ; if 
enougb people were interested, 
it could run on subscr iptions 
a lone. If the bus had 50 pas-
sengers, the cha rge ra te would 
be $8 per week, which would be 
more lha n a permit. 

There were two sub-options 
to the option of remote pa rking_ 
The cost for the first , campus 
remote, would be almost the 
same as for the current shuttle . 

It was discussed at the 
session that along with the 
enlarged shuttle, a new parking 
lot would have to be recom-
mended. The campus/ medical 
center shuttle could probably 
service 1,611 people . A sug-
gestion was made to surface a 
lot on the Wet~t side of 1-5, which 
would be a vailable only to 
shuttie users_ It was proposed 
at """ wMr~ tit t .• 
stickers for this new lot would 
cost as much as c mpus 
stickers, but the shuttie servIce 
would be free _ 

The other sub-option would 
be the use of San DleJlo Sta-

tile dean of lI'aduate studies 
and tbe associate dean of 
admissions at the medical 
school. 

Dr. Manual Rotenbu .... dean 
of ,raduate studies. said 
although be expecta no pro-
JI'8lll8tic cbanges. there may 
be psychological effects re-
sulling from the Supreme Court 
decision that ruled racial 
quotas unconstitutional while 
simultaneously allowing race 
to be a factor in admissions. 

"Suddenly it ' s no longer 
affirmative action," said 
Rotenburg. "We're no longer 
bendinl over backward to 
welcome minorities. Tbat may 
bave a dampeniDi effect on 
minority enrollme t.·· 

Dr. Cbarles S, nero asso-
ciate dean of admissions at the 
medical scbool. said the Bakke 
decision bas resulted' in a 
"renewed enthusiasm to con-
tinue the programs we have 
been engaged in. Our ,oal is to 
get many disadvanta,ed stu-
dents into the (medical) 
scbool." Tbe medical school 
bas received a three-year 
Federal grant to increase 
medical school opportunities 
for minOrities, said Spooner. 

Dr. Charles Thomas, pro-

feasor of Urban and Rural 
Studies, pointed to the possible 
l18Iative effect of the Bakke 
case on minority enrollment. 
He KlIye 8S an example an 
article in the San Dlep U .... 
(Aul. 22, 1971) reporting that 
three of · the top students at 
Lincoln Higb School cbole to 
attend Morehouae College, a 
black school in Atlanta. even 
though they had scholarships 
from more prestigious uni-
versities. such as Stanford, UC 
Berkeley and USC. 

"Many young blacks feel 
their needs will not be met there 
(Stanford, UC Berkeley and 
USC)." said Thomas. "They 
are confronted directly or by 
innuendo whether they will be 
will be to 

what they are confronted by." 
Thomas said a cultural 

support system for black and 
other ethnic students is needed, 
mentioning initiating black 
fraternaties and sororities. 
drawing more black speakers, 
and providing more role mod-
els for ethnic students as ways 
of creatin, in the Univenity an 
atmosphere that will attract 
ethnic students. 

Rotenbu.... too, ls not uti. 
fied with the number of minor-
ities at UCSD at the graduate 
level. " We (the office of 
graduate studies and research-
OGSR) take a very active role 
in encouraging the depart-
ments to look at more than 
academic standards." be said. 
• 'But the number of ",ilnl\r~tv 

students is not large enough. It 
would take a tremendous 
amount of money to do signifi-
cantly better." 

Rotenburg did say the OGSR 
is seekiDJ minorities stronler 
than ever and that they have 
more money than in the past to 
support minority ,raduate 
students. 

The eme ... ence of race as a 
positive concept is one outcon)e 
of the Bakke case Thomas sees 
as promising. "It is up to black 
scholars to recognize, develop, 
and exploit it - those are the 
hallmarks of a scientist." he 
said. 

Background Bakke 
Through the development of 

race as a positive concept there 
can be a legitimization of ethnic 
studies. Thomas said. "You're 
talking about achievements, 
accomplishments, struggles -
you're talking about tbe nature 
of oppression" when you speak 
of the content of ethnic studies, 
he said. 

Alan Bakke first applied to 
the UC Davis medical school 
in 1973. He was rejected and 
reapplied again in 1974 to 
Davis and ten other schools. 
He was turned down by all of 
them. While discussing his 
Davis application with 
ICbooI officials he learned 
that his grades and test 
scores were higher than 
some of the students ad-
mitted tbrough the affirma-
tive action program. 

The Davis admissions 
program sets aside 16 oC 100 
spaces for "disadvantaged 
students," a term the Uni-
versity chose to mean 
blacks. chicanos. American 
Indians, and Asian-Ameri-
cans. 

Bakke filed suit. charging 
that he was denied ad-
mission on the basis of his 
race and this violated his 
constitutional rights to equal 
protection under the law. In 
September 1976, the Cali-
Cornia Supreme Court a-
greed with him. The UC 
Regents appealed the case to 
the US Supreme Court. 

In July, 1978 the Supreme 
Court handed down a three-
pronged decision. The Court 
voted 5-4 to admit Bakke to 
medical school. They voted 
by the same margin to 
declare the Davis quota 
system faulty. By the same 
score they said an ap · 

. plicant's race can be con· 
sidered in admissions con-
siderations. -Dr.C .............. _ 

" It is not enough to have 
programs to attract one seg-
ment of society ." he said. 
"Revelle has this concept of 
training the Renaissance man 
- but that's all within the 
context of Western civilization. 
Social sciences put a dis-
claimer on non-European 
accomplishments. " 

"The University must' de-
velop programs that will 

attr~t people from ~ <:'Om-

AS Finally Takes Hold at UCSD· 
(ceaclnHd from ,..e 5) 

ElectioDl on. both questions 
were beld in April of ms. The 
Coop was recopiJed as the 
official student ,overnment in 
a ~ yes vote. aDd Tanana's 
proposal was overwhelmlngly 
defeated. T7% votiDJ to main-
tain the mandatory fee. 

Here. the administration 
returns to the picture. In 1972, 
administrators i,nored tbe 
Re,enU' 5O'fo participation 
requirement. In 1975, tbey 
adhered to it, and sWI refUled 
to recognize the Coop, terming 
i\ tbe "unofficial" repre-
sentative of the student.. 

Antalonism between tbe 
Coop and the UCSD adminis-
tration was pretent all duriDl· 
the Coop's hiatory. One letter to 
the Triton Times publiahed in 
1976. sums up tbe Coop's 
perception of the Coop-Ad-
ministration relationsbip . 
..... (The administration) does 
not want us to be legitimate. 
The Coop represents a threat to 
administration control of the 
student government. The Coop 
repreeents wresting political 
control from the administra-
tion," the letter, written by 
Coop sympathizers. said. 

The Coop's second major 
controversy' involved appoint-
ment of student state-wide 
repreeentatives from UCSD. ln 
May, It'15. the Coop eliminated 
its requirement that members 
attend.. two of the last three 
meetings in order to be eliJible 
to vote. 

Shortly after that, LiMandri 
and Inna Munoz were elected 
u UCSD'I state-wide represen-
tatives. Opponent. charged 
tbat the two bad stacked the 
election, brin,in, in forty 
supporters Just before the vote 
on their appointment. almost 
all of wbom alleledly left after 
the vote wal taken. 

Controveniea of tbil sort 
dOlled the Coop. In addition to 
intereat JfOUP domination and 
adminiltration opposition. the 
Coop w.. aCCUIeCl of being 
radfcally unrepreaentative of 
the student population as a 
whole, by virtue of what critics 
claimed was a far left orien-
tation. -

OtIaers. sucb as Jeff Liefer. 
later to be the first ASUCSD 
President. cha ... ed that the 
Coop was irresponsible, that it 
lacked any authority .tructure 
and system of determined 
respoDlibUitiea. 

Ann Carberry. now ASUCSD 
Vice-President and a former 
Coop member, beUeves that the 
Coop became too strident in 
1176-77, 10lin, some of its 
ideological g081s to mean-
inllell rhetoric. Carberry also 
feels that perhaP8 new entering 
students were be¢)mil1l in-
creasiDily disaffected with the 
non-traditional form of student 
government bere. 

Whatever the reason. the 
Coop came under increasing 
criticism and pressure from 
both student and administra-
tive sources. 

DuriDJ the summer of 1976, a 
task force on developiDi new 
student ,overnment models 
was commiuioned by the 
Chancellor. This student· led 
talk force proposed several 
alternatives to the Coop. none 
of whicb were adopted. Still. 
force. were at work to unseat 
the Student Cooperative Union. 

Those forces continued to 
,ain credence and a following 
until winter of 1977. when a 
referendum was finally called 
by the administration to 
determine the future shape of 
government at UCSD. Students 
were to vote for different 
government models. including 
the Coop, with the top two 
contenders faciDi eacb other in 
a run off. The winner would 
become the officially recog-
nized student government at 
UCSD. 

At first. proposals were not 
forthcomiDl, but finally. three 
models were placed before the 
students: the Coop, the Cabinet 
Assembly (a Mark Sindler. 
first ASUCSD Vice-President. 
proposal whicb combined the 
open assembly of the Coop with 
the cabinet structure of a 
parliament) , and the ASUCSD. 
a traditional student council 
form of government with 
commissioners and defined 
areas of responsibility. 

The election resuits werOJ 
dramatic. The ASUCSD re-
ceIved approximately 5ffo of 
the vote, obvlatiDJ the need for 

further elections. The Cabinet 
Assembly got 32% , and the 
Coop 160/0 . With that. the CooP. 
dependent on student interest, 
died. 

The TranllUon Team . 
Following the election, the 

college governments ,ot 10-
,ether and appointed a four 
man "Transition Team" to 
provide for orderly student 
government and ASUCSD 
elections. 
. It served until May, 1977, 
giving way to the newly elected 
AS, but not without consider-
able difficulty first. 

The student-body-wide elec-
tions in May were the first in 
UCSD history involvin, all four 
colleges . Claims of fraud were 
widespread, and six candidates 
were disqualified before the 
r:unoff. including the leading 
academic affairs contender 
Laura Kerl and the second 
place presidential candJdate 
Steve Grady. 

All six candidates protested 
their disqualification to the 
Transition Team Election 
Board, and a week after the 
first elections. the Election 
Board reversed itself, allowing 
all candidates previously 
removed from the election to be 
reinstated. 

Grady went on to lose to Jeff 
Leifer. in a landslide. but Keri 
won her post, along with 
several others not affected DY 
elections irregularities, in-
cluding Barry Hyman, Student 

Welfare Commissioner, Jim 
Lofgren, Appointments and 
Evaluations . Jim Atkins . 
Activity Fee Board Chair and 
Bob Drapeau. External Af· 
fairs . Tbe MUCSD 

Last year was the ASUCSD's 
first . When asked to reflect on 
the year. most AS Council 
members will say that the first 
year was spent building. 
providing a groundbase for 
future governments. 

The AS was recognized as 
legitimate by the adminis-
tration (the old 50% rule was 
thrown out, replaced. at least 
for the first election. by a 25% 
student esta blished figure), 
and survived its only scandal of 
any major dimension (Bob 
Drapeau was accused of mis-
appropriating External Affairs 
funds to rent luxury c ars . 
instead of the state mandated 
economy cars - charges whicb 
were never proved.

Te'n'ure Process Comes Under Fire 
Can Students Judge Profs? Saltman Says Process 

Test Results Indlcata.- Not Is Best For Everyone 
8yRuA8ber 

New ....... 
. Given tbat students may 
participate in profenor 
evaluatioaa for tenure at some 
poiDt in the future, a queatioD 
remains: Can atudeDts eval-
uate teacbin, effectiveness 
accurately? A study coaducted 
by Miriam Rodin, professor of 
psycboloo at San DieIo State, 
and ber busband, Burton 
Rodin, DOW the Chairman of the 
UC San Dielo Mathematics 
Department, ahedsdoubt on the 

. validity of student ratinp. 
Tbe study, publisbed in 

Seleace ma,aaiDe iD 1'72, 
allowed a neptive correlation 
between the amount learned 
from an iDatnIctor and the 
I!'tudenu' evaluation of bis 
teachiDC performance. In other 
words, students rated most 
biJb1y lnatnIctora from wbom 
they teamed least. 

Tbe RodiDS' study .. as 
conducted on a mathematics 
class taqbt at UCSD by Burton 
Rodin. The inatnJcton rated 
were the T As who met with 
their students for an hour twice 
a week, once to answer 
questions and once to admin-
ister test problema and go over 
previous ones. Care was taken 
not to allow the T As to see the 
teat problems before they were 
administered. It was felt that, 
"if instructors have pr,ior 
fn(ormation about the coDtents 
of tests, they may, intentionally 
or unintentionally, pau it on to 
the students." , 

"It is always good practice to 
eliminate such potential bias 
from testing procedures," 
explained the Rodins. "In thi8 
case it is particularly impor-
taDt since otherwise an 
obtained positive correlation 
(for teachilll effectiveneu vs. 
student ratilll) may merely 
reflect tbe tendency of 
popularity-miDded teachiD, 
auiatants to hint at or 'teach to' 

the teat items." 
In order to determine the 

amount learned by the Au-
dents, eacb section was 
auipeel an initial ability score 

ba~ed on the mean ,rade 
obtained by the students in that 
section in the prece_din, 
quarter. (Tbe study was 
cODducted iD tbe Sprin, 
quarter.) The amount learned 
in each 8eCtion in the quarter 
under study was defmed by the 
avera,e ,rade obtained in that 
section. Since initial ability 
mi,bt bave varied amon, 
sections, a statistical test, 
wbicb in effect beld initial 
ability constant amoDg 
aectiona, wasuaedtodetermine 
the amount learned. 

Tbe T A for eacb section 
received a student evaluation 
score hued on the mean ralinl 
liven to him by his studeDts. 
'!be evaluations were obtained 
duriOl the large lecture at the 
end of the quarter. The question 
uaed in the analysi8 was, "What 
grade would yOU aaaUm to vour 
T A's total teacbilll perform-
ance?" 

The Rodins concluded their 
study stating, "if how much 
students learn is considered to 
be a major component of good 
teaching, it must be concluded 
that good teaching is not validly 
measured by student evalu-
ations in their current form." 

Other studies have also shed 
doubt on the validity of student 
ratin,s . In another Selnce 
article, an en,ineeriDg 
professor suaeated that be 
could manipulate his studeDt 
ratings dowDwards by lec-
turing on material not covered 
in the text, but complimentary 
to the course. 

The .. Dr . Fox" studies 
abowed that a lecturer who 
delivered iDformation iD a 
penonable and entertaining 
manDer was rated highly, 
regardless of tbe lecture 

content . Only in strailht-
forward lectures did content 
itself mate a difference in 
student ratings. Dr. Fox was an 
actor wbo delivered all the 
lectures in various styles, in 
order to eliminate rating biases 
sucb as the inatructor's 
physical appearance 

Miriam Rodin, in a paper 
which appeared in The Center 
Mapzi-e iD 1975, suggested a 
possible explanation for the Dr. 
Fox results: "The students who 
find no excitement or gratifi-
cation in learning and who view 
the educatioDal aspects of 
coUeee as a series of obstacles 
to ,et over, or slide under, as 
painlessly as pouible, natur-
ally value any respite from the 
tedium of acbool and clau-
room. It is perfectly natural 
that a teacher who can deliver 
tbi8, whether communicalinl· 
subject matter or not, would 
possess great value in the eyes 
of these students." 

Rodin feels that eveD 
studeDts who find education 
intellectually exciting may rate 
eDtertaining instructors more 
highly. "I would guess they find 
college on the whole rather 
boring , since intellectual 
stimulation does not come from 
acquiring information in 
painless doses and memorizing 
it. The kind of intellectual 
activity that is stimulating-
or,anizing, integrating , 
criticizing; activity in wbich 
{actuai knowledge is taken for 
granted-is .precisely the kind 
of activity that is de-empba-
sized in deference to the 
lleterogeneous abilities of the 
student body. Hence the good 
students, as bored as the 
others, value equally tbe 
professor who brings theater to 
the classroom." .

Will Wrilbt's "Sex and Vio-

Sprlnl, aocordinl to committee

was asked to Join the Aasoci-
ated Students (AS), and mem-
bera now report to Mar,ot 
Tempereau, AS Commissioner 
of Academic Affairs.

Sabo eJtplained that she first 

poew interested in the com· 
mittee when, to satisfy her 

curiosity, she be,aD iDves-
tilatin, some of Wrigbt's

The more she looked around the

Sabo estimated that about 
•• % of the professora .and 
,raduate students that sbe 
interviewed were afraid to talk. 
They would be willinl to talk 
re,areUn, quasi-Ie,al ocur-
rences at the university only off

of paranoia," Sabo aaid. 

Because of the Cemmittee

_vera I UCSD atudeats, Paul 
Saltman, V~Uor 0(

for the San Die,o Trial Law-
yers Criminal Syllabua. 

Recommendations from 
work colleaeues and contacts 
are also considered extremely 
important in any probation 
report. 

Student interest in Beckley's 
case bas been hi.h. Beckley 
told TIle Guardian Sunday tbat, 

. "I've received quite a large 
number of letters and phone 
calia wanting information or 
expressing support." Beckley 
has also met with groups of 

students over the past few 
weeki to diseuaa bil status,

Saturday. "I feel tbat not

After the Friday meeting 
with Beckley, Annltate told 
Tbe Guardia that be was open 
to all student input, whether for 
or a,ainat Beckley, or just 
informational. . 

Becldey, who plead innocent 
at lUI al'l'llipment laat Tbun-
day, baa been asked by Uni-
versity officials to absent 
bimlelf from the campus, a 
request with which he has 
compUed. He is currently on 
inveati.atory leave without 
pay. Assistant Dean Judith 
Green has been named Muir 
Actin. Dean in Beckley's 
ablence. 

Beckley was arrested while 
aUeJedly trying to cash checks

Richard ' Armita,e, Muir Pro-

Nick Atma met last Friday

Whether Beckley will return 
as Dean between DOW and the

Stewart by ArrnJ.ta,e, to wbom 
Beckley is directly responsible. 
Beckley expects some sort of 
decision this Friday, he told 
Tile Guardian, but Stewart 
refuses to comment, saylna 
that no decision or option was 
contemplated as of Sunday, 
though Armita,e says Stew-
art's options presumably 
include reinstatement, transfer 
to another department, dis-
missal and continuance of his 
current status. 

The next legal step for 
Beckley ia October 24, at the 
Readineaa Conference. That is 
the traditional step ·in the , 
jl.!,dicial system for plea bar-
gaining, a possibility Beckley 
told The GuardJaa be does not 
rule out, but one be will leave to 
his attorney's discretion.

Now there's a Tampax tampon 
designed to lUeet every need 

SUPER PLUS 
Super Plus Tampax tampons are ideal for _ 
heavy flow days because there is no 
tampon that's more absorbent or more 
comfortable. With the extra protection 
Super Plus tampons provide, you may 
never again need the help of a pad. 
When your flow is not as heavy, taper off 
to Super or Regular Tampax tampons . 

SUPER 
Super Tampax tampons are the #1 choice of more women 
than any other tampon in the world. Like all Tampax 
tampon , they're designed to conform naturally to your 
inner contours. You can depend on them to help you 
avoid menstrual bypass and embarrassing accidents like 
leakage and staining. T<nn"C1.lIh""M ~III ... dSI""b W ... 

REGULAR 
Regular Tam pax tam pons are perfect 
for a lighter flow. They're easy to in ert. 
Like Super and Super Plus, the mooth 
container-applicator places the tampon 
correctly nd hygienically. 
Your fingers never touch the tampon. Unlike tampons 
with plastic applicators, both the tampon and applicator 
are flu hable and biodegradable. 
Tampax tampon now give you even more 
freedom of choice.

housing. Due to a housing 
shortage, however, these 
students will remain on waiting 
lists until space is found for 
them in campus dorms or 
apartments, or until they find 
housing o((-campus. 

Off-campus housing is in 
short supply as well . The 
vacancy factor in the San Diego 
area is down from 5 t06 percent 
three years ago, to only 1 
percent this year. 

Larry Barrett, Director of 
UCSD's Food and Housing 
Services, explained that there 
are several reasons for the 
present lack of housing. " No 
one is building new apartments 
o{(-campus because of ProJ)o-
sition 13. If anyone builds now 
they bave to pay current 
property taxes, otherwise they 
would pay 1975 taxes on old 
apartments," he said. 

The new University Towne 
Centre has had some effect on 
the availability of housing in 
the area because of their 
employees, said Barrett. A lot 
of apartments are converting 
into condominiums, he added. 

The housing shortage is 
reflected in the breakage factor 
of housing contracts, noted 
Barrett. Tbe breakage factor is 
the number of contracts which 
are mailed out and not returned 
by prospective dorm occu-
pants. Normally tbis figure 
falls around 20%; this year it 
has dropped to 10%, said 
Barrett. 

Housing Services did not 
anticipate the shortage to be as 
acute as it is, said Barrett. " We 
should have had a waiting list, 
but only for those who live 
witbin 15 miles off-campus," he 
said. 

This year, however, many of 
those on the waiting list are 
transfer students who live

Loveberg Takes Over as . 
Acting Revelle Provost 

By Ran Aabar 
NewsEdI .... 

Rallih Loveber" a Revelle 
physics professor, baa been 
appointed Actine Provost of 
Revelle Collete following June 
Tapp's resignation last June. 

He thUi becomes the fourth 
Revelle Provost in the past 
seven years, expectlq to serve 
only one year and then makinJ 
way for the pennanent prov •. 

Tapp's resllD8tion, already 
in tbe workl during late SPrinc 
Quarter, was a result of her 
hUlband's inability to find an 
academic position in the San 
DieJO area. Wben Tapp atreed 
to leave the University of 
Minnesota and her hUiband to 
become provost in 1978, she 
expected that ber spouse would 
shortly join her. As it became 
clear that such was not to be the 
case late last year, Tapp 
decided that sbe must rejoin 
her busband even if sbe was 
forced to resign her position as 
provost. 

Campus officials were 
shocked by Tapp's decision. "I 
think it's terrible," said Vice-
Chancellor of Academic ACCairs 

Student 
Housing 
Tight 

(conUoIied from pqe I!) 

Paul Saltman. "It was' our 
understanding that both she 
and her hUiband were gojng to 
cope," be explained. 

Unlike ber two predecessors, 
Murray Goodman and Morris 
Friedkin, Tapp wasexpected to 
serve for longer than two years, 
accordin, to Ernie Mort, 
Revelle Dean of Students. 

Saltman feels that the fre-
quent turnover of the Revelle 
Provost's po.ition since he 
served in that capacity from 
1967 to 1972 bas not hanned the 
College as much as it might 
have. "Tbere is a stability 
inherent to Revelle because of 
its faculty and its provost's 
staff," he said. 

It ia the responsibility of the 
VIce-Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs to appoint an acting 
provost. Saltman explained 
that be consulted with the 
senior faculty of Revelle 
College, stu.dents on the Exec· 
utive Committee of Revelle, 

other college provosts and the 
Revelle Provost's orfice staff in 
the process of offering the 
position to Loveberg. 

Loveberg said he was sur-
prised at being asked to fill the 
role because of the low profile 
he has maintained. Afl#r ten 
days of "violent oscillations, " 
Loveberg "felt that in this 
situ-ation, for a year , con-
sidering myself as a veteran 
faculty member on this campus 
with a real interest in the 
undergraduates, in the end I 
was obligated to (accept the 
position) since I was asked." 

In his first two months as 
acting provost, Loveberg has 
not found .. any particular 
difficulty" in being an interim 
provost as opposed to being a 
permanent appointee. " I have 
the distinct advantage of 
having been at Revelle from the 
very first year and letting in the 
first undergraduates," he 
explained. "I am familiar with 

the workings of the college and 
I the issues that it is (acing," he 
said. 

Loveberg has served on the 
Revelle College Executive 
Committee for the past two 
years and has taught phYSics in 
both of the lower division 
science sequences at Revelle as 
well as teaching at the upper-
division and graduate levels.

' ... 13 

A major issue faCing Revelle 
is tbe effect of Proposition 13, 
said Loveberg. He feels that a 
harsh reassesment of priorities 
is necessary, and that such 
discussions should be held at all 
levels of administration. 

Another major activity to be 
dealt with is the ongoing 
curriculum review at Revelle, 

(please tam &0 pa.e It) 

stay at a botel or motel for two 
or three days, stated Gloria 
Spencer, Director of Off-
Campus HOUIine. 

"If you're nexible, williDJ to 
spend $140 for a room to be 
shared with another student, 
you should find bouainJ within 
two or tbree days," said 
Spencer. 

Sove .$1.00 of your record. or tape

Many students take lonaer to 
find housing because they do 
not want to ahare a room, 
because they smoke, or have 
other expectations about their 
housing environment, she said. 

Spencer estimates that 
approximately 5000 students 
seek off-campua housln, each 
year. They may end up paying 
anywhere from $60 a month to 
$250 for an off-campus apart-
ment or studio. 

By next year the bousing 
shortage should be fjlleviated 
with the addition of 250 
additional undergraduate 
spaces, said Barrett. Third and 
Warren ColleJles will be the 
beneficiaries of _ additional 
spaces to be opened for 
students by Fall, 1979. At the 
same time the Mesa under-
graduate apartments will be 
converted to married and 
graduate student apartments, 
eliminating wails of up to two 
years for an on -campus 
apartment (or a slnele grad-
uate student. 

As for tbis year, Barrett 
expects that everyone will be 
settled by the third week of Fall 
quarter. 

One of the few options 
remainln, for tbe Housin, 
Service this year Is to place 
three .tudents Into some rooms 
in the Revelle Unit 2 dorms. 
"This was not well-received by 
tbe students a couple of years 
ago when we tried it," 
commented· Barrett. Such 
action is not planned for this 
year.

BLACK HOLES 
A giant star dies in what 

astronomen call a catastroph-
ic gravatational collapse. The 
matter in the dying star is 
sucked into the stellar center 
and smashes together with 
such force that it compresaes 
itself out of existence and 
becomes a "black hole" in 
space. 

You can't see a black hole, 
bear it or even smell it. And yet 
black holes are the hottest topic 
among astropbysicists today. A 
recent article in the Sept. 4 
edition of Time magazine notes 
that tbese "invisible" holes are 
talked about at cocktail parties 
and large scientific gatherings: 
Hardly a week passes without 
the publication of some new 
insight into black holes and the 
topic is ODe of the favorites on 
the lecture circuits.

Truth In Testing Law Passes 
Landmark legislation, whicb 

for the lint time opens the 
books of standardized testing 
companies to the public, was 
passed uDaDimously by the 

. State Assembly last mODth, 
Approved by a 76-0 vote, 

Senator JohD Dunlap's (D-
Napa) SB 2805 requires pro-
ducen of .standardized tests to 
cUaclOR both detailed binancial 
and "truth-In-telting" informa-
tion to students and indepen-
dent reeearcben. 

Sponsored by the U C Student 
Lobby, SB 2005 requires testing 
corporations to disclose: 

-questions and answers to 
the tests 

-technical data bearing on 
the quality of test items 

-reports of the predicta-
bility and standard error 
of the tests 

-financial data detailing test 
costs and revenues 

-all available "truth-in-
testing" information to 
both students and Cali-
fornia postsecondary insti-
tutions that use the tests. 

"Every higb scbool, college 
and ,raduate student in Cali-
fornia is virtually at the mercy 
of standardized tests," said U C 
Student Lobby Co-Director 
Bret Hewitt. "Our hope is that 
S8 2005 will help botb students 

and the public to understand 
lhe shortcomings of these 
tests." 

As postsecondary institutions 
have become increasingly 
reliant on test scores for 
admission and placement 
purposes, a number of signifi-
cant issues have arisen about 
test validity, reported cultural 
bias, alleged excessive co&' 
and domination of the indust, ,, 
by one testing agency. 

Most of the tests are pro-
duced by the Educational 
Testing Service (ETS) which 
controls about 80% of the 
testing rna rket.

FDA Says Sunscreens Thwart Cancer 
By Doug Campion 

Seleeee Editor 
"Overexposure to the sun 

may lead to premature aging of 
the SkiD and skin cancer." 

So reads the first sentence of 
a warning suggested for the 
labels of' all sunscreen prod- . 
ucll. Tbe recommendation was 
made by an advisory panel 
appointed by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) to 
study the safety and effec-
tiveness of all over-the-counter 
dl'Uis. 

The panel concluded that 
aside from simple sunburns. 
many of the more harmful 
effects caused by exposure to 
the ultraviolet rays emitted by 
the sun may be reduced by the 
application of a sunscreen 
product. The committee rec-
ommended that all such prod-
ucts carry a lable with the 
statement: "The liberal and 
regular use of this product may 
reduce the chance of pre-
mature aging of the skin and 
skin cancer." 

The panel also advised that a 
system be adopted for rating 
the protective abilities of the 
various sunscreens. Similar to 
that already used in the 
European labeling system, the 
rating would range in numbers 
from " 2", for minimal protec-
tion. to "8". the strength 
suggested for people with fair 
complexions and who are easily 
sunburned. 

The rating number. itself, 
would serve as a multiplier 
which could be used by the 
sunbather to approximate the 
amount of time he or she could 
safely spend in the sun. For 
example, a person who nor-
mally can spend only 30 
minutes in the sun without fear 
of a serious burn could bask (or 
two hours (four times the 
usual) while wearing a sun-
screen of strength " 4" . 

Ultraviolet rays stimulate 
the production of melanin. a 
dark pigment. which rises to 
the surface of the skin causing 
the brown tan color so sought 
aCter during the summer 
months. At the surface. the 
melanin acts to shield the cells 
beneath it - a sort of natural 
sunscreen. So, with continued 
exposure to the sun, and with 
the beginning of a good suntan, 
the strength of the sunscreen 
used may be gradually de-
creasC\i so that more and more 
of the sun 's rays are allowed to 
reach the skin directly_ 

Too much ultraviolet radia-
tion can severely damage and 
even destroy the melanin-
producing cells. leaving the 
skin unable to protect itself. A 
sunburn causes an increased 
flow of blood to the outer layers 
of skin for protection and 
healing. This is-what causes the 
blistery . red look after too 
much sun is taken in at one 
time. 

Light of the same wave-
lengths that cause sunburns 
can also affect the DNA 
contained in the nuclei of the 
skin cells . This sometimes 
results in abnormal growth of 
the skin tissue: skin cancer. By 
redirecting (or misdirect-
ing" ) some of the intense rays 
of direct sunlight. sunscreens 
allow a longer exposure to the 
sun without as great a risk of 
development of a burn or skin 
cancer. 

Of course. because sun-
sc reens reflect and refract the 
rays which WGuld otherwise hit 
the skin direc~ly. the develop-
ment of a bronze. Caltrornia tan 
will be slowed l omewha t. The 
tan which will re ult. though, 

will probably be a less painful 
and a longer-lasting one than 
the beet red of a first day on the 
beach after a long winter 
indoors. . 

The FDA panel advised 
consumers to apply the sun-
screen product liberally for 
best results. It should be re-
applied after swimming or 
excessive perspiring. 

For five years the advisory 
committee conducted tests on 
each of the 27 ingredients found 
in a large sample of sunscreen 
products. Of these. 21 were 
classified as being " safe and 
effective_ " Three of the re-
maining six ingredients re-
quired further testing before an 
accurate classification could be 
determined. The other three 
ingredients were labeled " not 
generally recognized as safe 
and effective" . None of those in 
this last group. however, is 
used in sunscreen products 
manufactured in the United 
States. 

The report of the advisory 
committee will be submitted to 
the FDA. which will in turn 
publish its own evaluation of 
the findings . The FDA will then

draw up a new set of re -
quirements for the labeling of 
sunscreen products. In abOut a 
year-perhaps a while longer-
the new label , complete with 
numerical rating , will be 
officially adopted. Soon after. 
consumers will have a uniform 
guideline to follow in the buying 
of sunscreens . 

Tl)is procedure-testing. eval-

uating. reporting-is a pa rt of a 
review by the FDA of a ll over-
the-counter or nonprescr iption 
drugs. There are currently 17 
panels of experts who were 
gathered together from outs ide 
of the government by the FDA. 
It is their task to examine the 
"sa fe ty . e ff ec tiv eness a nd 
labeling" of all nonprescription 
drugs on the ma rket. For the 
past five yea rs this one panel 

has concentrated its research 
on a category o( over-the-
counter drugs known as topical 
analgesics. Th-is classification 
includes any'protective or pain-
relieving cream or ointment 
which is applied externally. 
such as a sunscreen. Other such 
pa nels are examining non-
prescrip tion sedatives , pain 
relievers such as aspirin and 
germ-killing agents.

almost nothing is known about 
how alcohol affects the brain:

- it gives a sense of euphoria

inquiry was more than abstract 
and was feeling for the real 
question. 

Studies show that child 
molesting, particularly incest, 
is far more common than most 
people believe. SFSI volunteers 
find calls about this subject 
most deeply troubling. 

A 15-year-old boy called to 
say his mother and a woman 
friend of hen wanted to have 
sex with him. He was fright-
ened. Wbat could he do? "I 
suggested, 'If it's not agreea ble 
to you, don't do it.' " said' 
Robinson . "Children often 
don 't realize they may have a 
cboice." 

Some of these callers would 
probably never go to anyone 
whom they bad to meet face to 
face. It's the anonymity ofSFSI 
that makes tbe service 
accessible. For many , the 
service can be a psychic life-
line, even for those with much 
simpler problems who are too 
embarassed to ask about things 
they think almost everyone 
knows or does. 

That includes volunteers 
add it helps explain why they 
are willing to pay a $75 fee to be 
trained to staff the phones. The 
fee is what keeps the service 
going. During nine weekly 
sessions and a weekend, 
prospective volunteers hear 
frank discussions, watch films 
made by the National Sex 
Forum and talk personally with 
otber trainees. The Cact that 
they're doing all this to help 
others also makes it possible 
for them to help themselves. 

Among these volunteers are 
many people 'n the helping 
professions who, like the three 
San Francisco women who 
Counded the Service, discov-
ered that sex is a subject 
shunned by many counselors. 

"I work Cor Youth Advo-
cates," said Garry Bassin, 20, 
who was a trainee last month. 
"A lot of people told me if I took 
this I'd know how to talk with 
the kids. And also. I needed to 
get my own stuff straight 
berore talking ~ith them." 

Joe Klaas , a novelist. 
volunteered for a mor 
pragmatic reason. " I found out 
the differen<'1.' between realistic 
sex and pornllgr&.lph ." hl' said . 
"lle&.lml'd I wrole rC4.llisli<:ally

San Diego Sports on 
the Upsurge: A Report 

By Henry J. DeVries 
The revolution has finally 

begun. All San Diego sports 
fans have to lose are their 
inferiority complexes. 

For years San Diego has been 
the doormat of the professional 
sports world. The town had 
great weather, nice beaches , 
and the worst teams in the 
country. Some people pointed 
out that it was only fair. If you 
lived in a place like Pittsburgh 
or Philadelphia you should at 
least get a few good teams to 
root for (what else is there to 
do?). San Diego, on the other 
hand, had so much else going 
for it. 

But San Diego fans, nor their 
hometown teams, are buying 
that anymore . San Diego sports 
franchises have startcd a lo( I 
uprising. For the first time they 
are giving the fans first class 
operations. The hapless and 
inept days appear to be over. 

the punch in the Padre lineup. 
Timely hitting and incredible 
defense from Rookie of the 
Year candidate Ozzie " the 
Wizard of Ahs" Smith have 
contributed greatly to the 
winning cause. 

However, it has been the 
exceptional pitching that has 
carried the team. Gaylord 
Perry (who is pushing 40) and 
mid-season acqUisition Eric 
Rasmussen have both proved to 
be consistent winners. Randy 
Jones is again pitching well , 
although he has experienced 
some tough luck losses. The 
stalwart from the bullpen has 
again been the mustachioed 
All-Star, Rollie Fingers .

FOOTBALL 

After years of fru tration and 
humiliation, the Chargers have 
finally got themselves a 
football team. By utilizing the 
draft Coach Tommy Prothro 
has constructed a team from 
the ruins he inherited five years 
ago. Aided by two astute 
preseason trades, the Chargers 
should enjoy their finest season 
since jOining the NFL. 

The Chargers were much 
better last year than their 7-7 
record indicates. They beat 
Oakland once and narrowly lost 
to New England and Denver 
(twice). The NFL season has 
expanded from 14 to 16 games 
this sea on, yet still runs from 
September to December. San 
Diego will host such powerful 
opponents as Oakland, Denver 
Miami , Cincinnati , an 

Page 23 

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his Los Angeles Laker teammates 
will be here Friday at 6pm for an intra-squad exhibition game. 

The recent vanguard of the 
revolt has to be the local tennis 
and soccer franchises . Both 
finished the 1978 season as 
division c ha mpions . The 
baseball and football clubs are 
both finally putting it all 
together. Each can now be 
labeled as winners, a word not 
often heard in San Diego's past. 
The sports climate is so good 
that pro basketball has 
returned to Am rica's "Finest 
City" . 

The Padres play their home 
games in San Diego Stadium, 
which has a basr LJdll capacity 
of 50,000. The major league 
baseball season runs from 
April until the end of 
September. Padre ticket prices 
are $4 .25, $3.75, $3 .2:> $2.75, and 

Chicago. 
(please tum to page 24) L _____ -;:=========~----..J 

The San Diego spo rt s 
facilities are also first class. 
San Diego Stadium is a clean 
and efficient multi-purpose 
ballpark. It features parking 
for 15,000, easy freeway access, 
and a new $1 million 
sCQreboard. The city was more 
than happy to show of{ the 
'Stadium during the 1978 Major 
League All-Star Game. TheSan 
Diego Sports Arena is a modern 
enclosed arena suitable for 
basketball, hockey, tennis, and 
a host of indoor activities . 
Seating capacity is well over 
13,000 . 

The following is a rundown of 
the pri'nciple pro sports San 
Diego has to offer. 

BASEBALL 

There once was a bumper 
sticker which read , "Support 
Mercy Killings-Eliminate the 
Padres." Nobody took it very 
seriously. Each year the 
Padres were already left for 
dead by the Fourth of July. 
Killing them would just be 
redundant. But 1978 has been a 
different story. 

Perhaps it was the All -Star 
Game which San Diego hosted. 
Or perhaps it was the new 
manager Roger Craig. Or just 
maybe it was the key trades 
made by the front office. 
Whatever the reason, the 
Padres have come alive after 
the All-Star break. 

The Padres have become one 
of the best teams in baseball 
during the season's second hal f. 
Only the poor first half and 
their equally poor showing on 
the road have kept them out of 
contention. This is the best 
team the Padres have ever 
produced. For the first lim in 
the team's hi tory they may 
finish above .500 . 

The bidlclub ha combined 
hiUing. defense. and pitching.

BASKETBALL 

Basketball is back in town. 
When an NBA franchise went 
up for grabs, it was San Diego 
which grabbed the hardest. 

A strong promotional 
campaign and season ticket 
drive convinced the BuCfalo 
Braves to puIJ up stakes and 
become the San Diego Clippers. 

to convince the Brav~ to leave 
Buffalo. This is very easy to 
understand if you have ever 
been to Burralo, pecially 
during the winter. The hard 
part was to convince the Braves 
to move to San Diego. 

The Clippers will play in the 
San Diegoipcn:tl ~rena, which 
has a basketball capacity of 

13,703. The 82 game regular 
NBA season stretches from 
October to March. Ticket 
prices are $4, " , $8, and $9. The 
home opener will be October 15 
against David Thompson and 
the Denver Nuggets. 

Standouts for the Clippers 
are four time All-Star forward 
Sidney Wicks, All-Star MVP 
Randy Smith, big center Swen 
Nater, and the notorious 
Kermit Washington. GeneShue 
will be handling tbe coaching 
duties (or San Diego. Shue is a 
formerNBA Coach of the Year. 
He also led the Philadelphia 
76ers to the 76-77 NBA playoff 
finals, where they were 
defeated by Portland (or the 
Championship. 

TENNIS 

They don't call Rod Laver 
··The Rocket" Cor nothing. 

In his first year as Friar 
player-coach, Rod "rocketed" 
the team into first place and 
never looked back. The Friars 
handily won their division with 
a 30-14 record. Come playoff 
time, though, things went a 
little differently. An injury to 
star Ross Case, aborted the 
Friars playofC try, as they were 
knocked out in the first round 
by a red-hot Seattle team. 

Doubles strength is what 
carried the Friars to victory 
after victory during the regular 
season. Th men's doubles 
team o( Case and Laver were 
third overall in the WTT. The 
women's doubles team of Mona 
Guerrant and Kerry Reid won 
the most sets and posted the 
second best record In WTT

SOCCER 

The San Diego Sockers 
proved that winning isn ' t 
everything. For one thing, it 
sure wasn't attendance. The 
Sockers were consistent 
winners, posting a 18-12 record 
and easily winning the NASL 

Western Di v ision . Yet 
attendance usually averaged 
under 5,000 fans . Many people 
feared that the low attendance 
figures might force the team to 
move once again. 

The Sockers may not have 
box o£fice appeal , but they do 
have a certain front office 
appeal. Their new owners are 
willing to invest time and 
money in building the 

Page 25 

franchise . They have also . 
recruited Marvin Milkes as 
General Manager and Hubert 
Vogelsinger as Head Coach. 

The NASL season runs from 
April to July. The Sockers play 
their home games at San Diego 
Stadium, which has a soccer 
capacity of25.400 . Ticket prices 
are $6. $4 , and $2 (18 years old

Botb were at UCSD this 
lUIIUIler. Both -have an interest 
in JJilIldn. More than that, the 
two are father and 1011. 

Wbile Dr. Benirschke toiled 
in hillaboratory with monkey 
placentas, bia son Rolf sweated 
out weeki of Chal'ler training 
camp at Warren College. As Dr. 
Benirschke was reviewing 
experiments , Rolf was re-
viewing his kick strategy. 

It may seem unusual that the 
son of a medical man would 

.£ ---' WE -
... , ... 

become a profeuional athlete. 
Rolf's formative yean were 
spent on tbe East Coast. The 
wine cellar of his bome had 
been converted into one of the 
first successful artificial breed-
in. grounds for Marmoset 
monkeys. An armadillo and 
dozens of gerbils were in 
another part of the house. Rolf 
used to collect Japanese beetles 
to feed them. It was because of 
this type of upbringing that Rolf 
choose Zoolo.y for his major at 
UC Davis. 

Sports had always been 
regarded as recreation for the 
family: skiing, tennis, hockey 
and soccer.

At La Jolla HiIb, Rolf's sport In bia fint year at Davia, Rolf 
was soccer. La Jolla had an was fint striqidcker. After a 
excellent team but most of his. season he realized that he 
buddies were Into football. really milled the comradery of 

"Yeab, all my friends were soccer and wanted to quit 
playing football and tbey kicking. Tbe football coach 
wanted me to join the team," pointed out to Rolf that none of 
Rolf refiected. But in 10th .rade the lame times confiicted, and 
I was too small, I would bave if be wanted, he could play for 
been trampled. My friends both teams. 
were persistent and in my 
senior year , without my 
knowledge, they asked the 
coach if I could just be the 
kicker. Soccer-style kicking 
was a new thing then and the 
football and soccer coaches 
worked it out so I could go both 
wavs." 

At tbis point Rolf half-
chuckled, " The game times 
didn't confiict, but sometimes 
I'd have to fly from one game in 
L. A. to another game in 
Seattle. It got hectic. And when 
I'd talk to my Dad about the 
games he'd always ask, 'well

lood-but bow are you doin' in 
school?' ." 

RoU sraduated with a B. S. in 
Zoology. That ume year, be 
was drafted to Oakland, then 
the Super Bowl cbamps. 
Sbortly after that he was picked 
up by San Diego. 

Since then Rolf has realized 
how much influence his status 
has given him. In the off-season 
he learned to be a public 
speaker and went to 30 or 40 
schools, Cub Scout meetings 
and other youth groups. 

"Wherever, I went, I always 
stressed the importance of an 
education. It's every young 
man ' s dream to go pro -
fessional, but it's hard work. 
And kids don't realize how very 
few make it, " said Benirschke. 

RoIr enjoys a team err~ "t in 
preference to a str. . • y 
individual sport. Kicking, he 
says, is a team effort. 

"U its's not snapped and 
placed properly, chances are 
the kick won't be good. It 's a 
real challenge. I get l.3 seconds 
to get the ball away-one 
chance. And everyone will 
know if I mess up. " 

Rolf analyzed his personal 
game plan and bow he gets 
ready for a game : "The 
important factor is to feel a part 
of the team, make friends , so 
when I'm out there, I have 44 
guys pulling for me on the side-
lines." 

Another point he stresses is 
the mental attitude toward the 
game. Rolf attests that kicking 
is about 79'Y" mental and only 
30% physical. Mental prepara-
tion-or "visual psycho -
perception" as Rolf tenns it- is 
seeing himself kick the ball 
between the uprights over and 
over again. This repetition 
helps him react to the tremen-
dous pressure of kicking before 
sell-out crowds or in a tie-score 
situation. His mental attitude, 
rather than drugs, is enough to 
get him up for the game. 

"Just thinking about playing 
gets me fired u~and it doesn't 
stop until the game does." 
Benirschke commented. 

At age 23, Rolf Benirschke is 
just beginning his pro ball 
career. The average duration 
for a player is 4.6 years. After 
the fun, the hard work and the 
traveling haVe run their course, 
Rolf has plans to become a 

vet~rinarian, continuing his. 
famJly 's medical tradition.

Smoking'S 
'Cruclal 
Test 

By Jelne BUyak 
Padtir News Serviee 

For many Californians, one 
of the moet crucial measures on 
next month's ballot win be a 
statewide initiative tbat is 
already letting more TV 
advertisiq coverase tban the 
.overnor's race-a propoeed 
ban 011 IIIlOkiq in both public 
aDd private buildings. 

Supporters of the measure, 
known as Proposition 5, say it ia 
not an antl-smoking campaiID. 
but a pro-non-smoking effort 
aimed at protecting the bealath 
of DOD-smoken. 

Jolene Babyak is a freelance 
journalist, who regularly 
contributes to Tbe Kansas City 
Star, TWA Ambassador 
magazine and otber publi-
catioDS. 

Opponents, led by well-
heeled tobacco companies, 
argue such a ban is unenforce-
able, too costly aDd a discrimin-
atory deprivation of personal 
rights. Some also assert that an 
enforced ban could result in 
unhealthy stress among 
smokers aDd a coosequentdrop 
in productivity alllOlll smoking 
worken. 

As one Lou Grant-type 
character in a TV ad sputters, 
as his newsroom is being 
partitioned off to protect the 
non-smoken, "Is this any way 
to run a newspaper?" 

Whatever tbe merits of the 
other oppomtioa arpmeau, 
the issue of strea ia one that 
has concerned a number of 
health experts in reeent yean, 
as smokers bave tried to kick 
the babit and cities haYe passed 
anti-smoking ordinances. Tbe 
California measure raiaes the 
stress question because it 
would severely restrict 
smoking in tbe workplace. All 
people wbo share work rooms 
with two or more otberworkers 
would be probibited from 
smoking. And smoken caught 
ligbting up wbere it is 
prohibited would be subject to a 
mandatory _ fme. 

Wblle there is little agree-
ment amODl the experts, tbere 
is DO evidence to suggest the 
wont-that ball the california 
work force will turn into 
nervous, snarlinl buUt cues 
if the measure passes. 

But Dr. Hans Selye, widely 
recopized as the father of 
stress teatinI, is concerned that 
sucb bans are DOt without risk 
to the 54 million Americans who 
smoke. Selye, pfesident of the 
International Inltitute of 
Stre .. in Montreal, Canada, 
feels that if you deny a cbromc 
smoker a cigarette that person 
is more likely to be inyolved in 
an accident, either on or off the 
job. 

"It's obvious that if someone 
is addicted to smoking aDd he's 
waiUng to smoke an hour aDd a 
half, it will decrease his 
efficiency," Selye said. 

Selye, who smoked for 30 
years before giving it up, 
acknowledged that smokin. is 
clearly harmful. "But so is 
driving a car," be added. 

Selye does not believe that 
cbrome smoken are neces-
sarily more slrel8ed than DOD-
smoken. However, smoken 
have learned to rely on the 
activity of smokiq for relief 
durinl periods of normal 
stress. 

Dr. Brian Danaber, assistant 
profeuor of public bealth at the 
University of California at LM 
ADleles, alreed that smoken 
would "clearly have to learn 
new ways to reduce pressures

Stress Is 
Issue In 
Contest 
on the Job " if they were 
enjoined from smoking. 

But Danaher noted that there 
still is no specific da ta on stress 
and nicotine withdrawal. He 
believes , however, that the 
period of transition , during 
which workers would have to 
learn ways of coping without 
cigrettes, would be temporary. 

On the other hand. some 
evidence suggests that in 
certain stressful situations 
people will continue to smoke 
despite a ban . Dr . Mark 
Sanford. who conducted a 
survey for the Wright Institute 
in Berkeley, Calif., following an 
anti-smoking ordinance passed 
last year, found that despite 70 
percent local approval of the 
ban , certain pockets of 
resistance endured. Notable 
among them were situations 
involving automobile sales , 
funerals and employment lines, 
all situations involving stress. 

Others argue that smokers 
easily become accustomed to 
going several hours without 
smoking. Dr. John W. Far-
quhar, director of Stanford 
University ' s Heart Disease 
Prevention Program, said 
smoking has been prohibited 
for some time in theaters, 
concerts , conferences and 
some public buildings. 

In fact. since 1975 dozens of 
cities and a few states have 
enacted laws aimed · at pro-
tecting non-smokers from 
smokers. Minnesota 's Clear 
Indoor Air Act makes it illegal 
to light up in public anywhere in 
the state except designated 
smoking areas. 

Even some businesses, such 
as the Jobns Manville Corp., 
whicb operates 14 asbestos 
factories, have banned smok-
ing while on the job. 

Farquhar does not agree with 
Selye that efficiency is 
necessarily hindered by such 
bans. " If I were the boss and 
somebody stepped outside 
every 20 minutes for a smoke," 
he said, "itwouldbeaproblem. 
But the number of breaks 
people have during the day 
should be sufficient to accom-
modate the smoker." 

He believes that Americans 
"a re in the middle of a 
fascinating change " with 
regard to smoking, and he cited 
a study showing that 90 percent 
of aU smokers say they would 
like to quit.

All of those questions are

"I wa. feeUn, .tined," 
recalla "maa. "I wu at a 
large acbool and the cIaue8 
were too bit. It Jut wam't 
aeademicaUy cbaUeDJiIIJ. I 
wanted to eet into an area that 
would be atimulatiDJ and to

Beaman'. complainu are

atudenta, lIaliD "71. "Some 
brllbt children feel oat of aync 
with their c1aaamates and their

JUit find claaaea are too large

At Simon's Rock the clalSeS 
are small, usually numbering 
four to 12 students and some-

timea 81 few u tbrfi. All the 
classes are seminars. 

There appean to be mount·

of LaGuardia Community 
College in New York City 
recently told educators at-
tending 1he annual meeting of 
the American Association of 
Higher Education. 

QuotiDJ a Carnegie Founda-

Brown Jr. ill)'ing wheD Brown 
deDi .. ever amokinI pot. 

"He il a product of tbe 
sixties. I doubt if there are very 
few people b1a ale in thiI state 
who bave not tried it." Auem-
blyman Paul Priolo of MaUbu 
said of Brown. 

Priolo told a newl conference 
at the Republican State CeDtral 
Committee convention here 
that be was not offended by the 
Idea that the lovernor had tried 
marijuana. 

"The Iuue iajult the fact that 
he lied for political eXpedi-
ency .... I get so damn mad 
when I hear Brown . getting 
away with tbislie," said Priolo, 
who added, "I've tried It -
more than once and less than 
three times." . 

Priolo said he believed 
Assemblyman Ken Maddy of 
Fresno was destroyed politi-
cally when he admitted during 
his uosuccessful campaign for 
governor laat spring that he had 
smoked marijuana twice. 

It was immediately after 
MaddY'1 disclolure that re-
porters allted Brown if he had 
ever tried marijuana. Tbe 
Democratic governor at first 
replied "I obey all laws of the 
state of Camomia," and later 
flatly denied ever trying 
marijuana. 

Brown was not immediately 
available for comment OD 
Priolo's charle .. 

"I've certainly beard enough 
Democrats in the Legislature 
say they have witnessed it 
(Brown smokilli marijuana) , 
and they just shake their heads 
when he deniel it," Priolo said. 

" I don·'t believe there are 
many people in Sacramento 
who believe Jerry Brown has 
not smoked pot. I don't believe 
it," Priolo said. 

He refused to say whicb 
Democratic legillators told 
bin . they witnessed Brown 
smoking marijuana, but he said 
it was "more than one."

Zevon and Springsteen Shoot It Out 
By Tim MacKenzie 
CoatrtbutiJl. Edllor 

The topic of discussion was rock and roll. It 
concerned, as it often does, tbe state of the art, or if 
there is any art left in rock n' roll to state. 

"I don't know, man. Rock n' roll is kind of like those 
ancient religious rituals. Especially those big 
stadium shows they put on." 

I thougbt about it for a moment, peeling tbe label off 
of my bottle of Miller's as I searched my brain for a 
respqose. 

" I 'm not sure I know what you're getting at," I 
queried, slumping back into an overstuffed pillow 
chair. 

"You know, when natives gathered for those fire 
god rituals or something. They all took some kind of 
drugs and justgot all excited and jumped around." 

" Kind of like a Kiss concert at Anabeim Stadium." 
"Yeab, right." 
It was one of tbose Btoned things that people say on 

the verge of coherency, or is that incoherency? 
Whatever. After a couple of lumbos it doesn't really 
make any difference. Yet Cor some reason it stuck in 
my head. I couldn't figure out if this was a profound 
thought or just an echo of what the older generation 
has been telling their long-haired offspring about rock 
for the past twenty years . 

"You can't think about nuclear 
proliferation, inflation, unem~ 
ployment, your marriage or 
status in life while listening to 
'Cat Scratch Fever.'" 

But thete Is sometbing about rock n' roll, be it the 
laser Iiihts and" nash bombs, the pompous strutting 
and poling of ita advocates, or the fanatical advances 
of faos following their idolized, deified "star". ' that 
lends itself to comparison with a religion. Rock stars 
are gods. 

But the more I thought about it. the less I was able to 
come to terms with myself on the Iisue. I was simply 
not going to write myself off as a mere "Collower" . I 
figured there mUlt be more to rock than this, 
something for people who want more than the usual 
run-of-the-mill three chord shit. 

Loud and redundant, stagnant in its development 

and primitive by its ver, nature, the rock music of the 
Nugents, et al., act as a controlling force in society. 
How can anybody listening to that crap at tbose 

vo~umes concentrate at all on anytbing of 
importance?The answer, of cour~, is t~ey c~n't. 'f ou 
can't think about nuclear proliferatIOn, !DOatIen, 
unemployment, your marriage or status in life while 
listening to "Cat Scratch Fever." But that's what the 
record companies give them, and that's what they 
take. It's enough to make a social worker tum off 
those stereos and shout "get.a job!" 

What rock has so sorely needed is a large dose of 
intelligence . Not necessarily the intelligence 
associated with social protest and consciousness, the 
stuffy high-brow seriousness or t.he egocentric sage 
wisdom oC a Dylan, but intelligent music with a sense 
of humor. 

Something you're not embarrassed to have on the 
stereo when some friends drop by the apartment. 

("Who me, listening to Van Halen? Naw, are you 
kidding? Must have been the neighbors. Fuckin' 
rowdies ... ") 

Something like the music of Warren Zevon or Br ~.;e 
Springsteen. 

Looking back briefly over the rock n' roll summer 
season here in San Diego, there wasn't really much to 
rigbt home about. Most ofthe good shows were booked 
down at the State Amphitheater, which is where the 
Zevon sbootout took place. 

Showcasing music from the LP that made bim 
famous (John Rockwell of the N. Y. Tlmes called 
Excitable Boy "one of the smartest, most exciting 
American rock records oC recent years") , Zevon and 
his rowdy band of gunslingers took State by stonn, 
with a sound that was even more hard-edged and 
rocking than the album. 

Listening to Excitable Boy was far more interesting 
than most political science courses I've taken, and 
contained as much Information and insight as any 
I've ever had. Zevon and his band emulate that 
image, looking like soldiers of fortune in true "Roland 
the Headless Thompson Gunner" style. Maybe they 
should give a seminar here at UCSD. Now that would 
be a IeOre for the poll. sci. department. 

"Zee-Von," the more boisterous (or drunk) in the 
audience are shouting at the furious conclusion of 
•• Lawyers, Guns at Money" . Kind of like how the cries 
were once heard for Dylan. The big difference 
between Zevon and Dylan is that Zevon has a sense of 
bumor, ondhat comes through on both disc and in Ii ve 
performance. 

Intelligent music. Smart music with an underlying 
reason d 'etre. Warren Zevon has heralded its return. 

Still, labeling him as "The Political Scientist" of rock 
music may not strike his fancy . But there's definitely 
more to him than the short streak of Clint Eastwdod; 
the gun lying on his dinner plate may be tbe meat, but 
there's more to a meal than just a piece of meat. 

"Here was another man who could 
write poignant ballads without 
making his audience feel pre-teen in 
mentality. " 
"In the 'SO ' s, " Zevon said, " I couldn' t have 

conceived owning a gun. Now in the '70·s. I feel that 
nobody 's going to mess with me. You go from 
mindlessly believing in peace to arming yourself to 
learn how to have it. The concept," he continued, "of 
Clint Eastwood as the justice-bent dope is more 
important than Richard Dreyfuss as the awestruck 
moron being carted off to Mars where everything will 
be just fine ." 

His violent side is Zevon's more noticeable side, but 
songs like" Accidently Like a Martyr" show another 
side, a romantic one at that. Even gunslingers have 
hearts. 

Sometimes it's hard to believe that beneath the 
tough exterior lies a veritable pussycat. It may be 
true in Zevon's case, and I have a hunch that it also 
holds true for an alleycat like Bruce Springsteen. 

Springsteen' s bash at the Sports Arena was 
unquestionably the rock n' roll event of the summer 
here in San .Diego, especially since Mick & Keith 
decided to shine on America's finest city. 

I found myself captivated by Springsteen's energy 
and-enthusiasm, as did the thousands of others on 
hand. Here was another man who could write 
poignant rock n ' roll ballads without making his 
audience feel pre-teen in mentality. 

With his black outfit and his aggressive Jersey 
strut, Springsteen looked like Sylvester Stallone's 
smaller brother, holding t e same romantic, street-
tough qualities that Sly ro so effectively in Rocky. 

Springsteen didn' t real y appeal to me after Bom 
To Run. but then it's a w~njer be even appealed to 
himself after the Time/ Newsweek debacle. But his 
recent Darkness OR ,1M-F.. eI T__ IAnl 1I ~Ii hUy 
foreboding in its approach, is downright excellent 
music. 

When it comes down to it, in Zevon and ::>pringsteen 
lies the hope that all American rock stars will not Call 
into the L. A. Cocaine Cowboy yndrome, that 
different perspectives will not become lost in th 
shufO Cor uniformity on the AM Top 40.

The GUllrd .. " 

·A Grouch's San Diego.Show Guide 
By JUI LouIse Bueley Coa&ri_" EdI .... 

In this theatre guide 1 do not 
attempt to tell you what 
productions are going to be 
good and what are going to be 
bad. All too often a "but you 
hate everything, Jill," or a 
"who is this Bazeley person 
anyway-she 'never writes a 
positive review," has reached 
my ean. Well, all right, I admit 
it-I do dislike practically 
everything I see. But 1 qualify 
my opinions and seek to 
salvage my credibility by 
suggesting that my dislikes are 
always by degrees, and that I 
am, to begin with, a grouch. 

And so, my preface being 
over, I now present a relative 
value study of the San Diego 
theatre scene-A Grouch's 
Guide. 

and "On the Harmfulness of 
Tobacco", "The Importance of 
Being Earnest", "A Streetcar 
Named Desire" and "Orestes, 
Orestes" (also titled seven 
other things out of which I think 
"Towarda an Oresteia" is the 
most communicative) . 

I recommend buying season 
tickets for the UCSD Theatre. 
This offers you four plays for 
the price of three and assured 
tickets (including extras if you -
pay the regular price) for all 
productions. A student sub-
scription is $9.00. Furthermore, 
if you wish to hobnob with 
actors, directors and other 
members of the elite in the 
UCSD Theatre community, you 
may become a "friend" of the 
theatre for $20.00 if you are a 
student, and $40.00 if you are 
not. Each friend membership 
includes two season sub-
scriptions plus various parties 
and lectures, along with an 
obscure sounding "special 
tour" to some Los Angeles 
theatre production (hopefully 
not the taping of the "Merv 
Griffin Show") . CaU 452-3791 
for more information. 

Robber Bridegroom" I saw 
this musical at the Mark Taper 
Forum and it was excellent), 
Shaw's "Heartbreak House", 
Hellman's "Toys in the Attic", 
"The Front Page" and 
"Equus". 

The Carter Center Stage (in 
Balboa Park) has scheduled 
"Otherwise Engaged" (worth 
seeing if done well) . " The 
Rnchanted" by Jean Giradoux, 
"The Misanthrope", a "to be 
announced ", and Harold 
Pinter's' 'Caretaker". A 
special holiday bonus produc-
tion will be the pantomime 
"Mother . Goose", a magical 

musical extravaganza starring 
Eric Christmas as Ms. Goose. 
Don't miss this, whatever you 
do . (Seriously.) 

The San Diego Repertory 
Theatre is quartered in an old 
mortuary chapel on Sixth 
Avenue , and although its 
productions are generally 
enjoyable, the wood pews are 
not. If )IOU haven ' t had a 
religious upbringing and aren 't 
used to this sort of thing, bring 
along a cushion for your back. 
The first production this season 
will be "Waiting for Godot" and 
student rush tickets can be 
bouglit for $2.00 at 8: 15 on the 

evening of the performance. 
Beyond this, the Rep people 
haven 't mapped out their 
shcedule for the fall, but it is 
almost certain they will present 
their special adaptation of "A 
Christmas Carol" over the 
holidays. I highly recommend 
this show, and I also suggest 
buying reserved seats at the 
regular price since "Christmas 
Carol" is always a sell-out 

California Pacific Theatre's 
(Balboa Park) fare is variable. 
I remember I couldn't bring 
myself to write about one of 
their shows last season because

The very !:>est theatre value in 
town is right here on campus at 
the UCSD Theatre. I have been 
attending since high school, 
and although in the past four 
years there were moments in 
which I was so bored I would, if 
I could, have sent a whole 
school of dramatic thought to 
the everlasting flames of hell, 
these moments were few. At 
least the UCSD drama depart· 
ment is not afraid to experi-
ment, and it is possible to see 
productions in the UCSD 
Theatre that you may .never see 
anywhere again simply 
because they are too artistic 
ever to make any money. And 
the theatre industry, unfor-
tunately, is more concerned 
with making money than with 
creating art. • 

Next on my list of best bets is 
The Old Globe Theatre/Car&er 
Center Stage. Here again a 
student can make out pretty 
inexpensively if he buys a 
season subscription and goes on 
Sunday afternoons, but single 
tickets are not prohibitively 
expensive either, often not 
costing any more than does one 
movie admission. The price 
schedules are complicated, so 
call 231-1941. 

This season The Old Globe

Strip's Declined, 
Says 'Batman' Kane 

By Mark S&adIer 
SpeeIaI .. TIle GunIIaa 

When Bob Kane was a 13-
year-old fIed&liDi cartoonist in 
the Bronx he saw a Leonardo da 
Vinci drawiq of a man with 
bat-winJEa attached to his back. 
Like all arUlts wbo obeerve 
everytbiqfor later use in their 
work, be tucked the "man-bat" 
image away in bis mind, wbere 
it stayed until tbe mid-I930s. 

At that time, Kane was 
working for one of the first 
comic book companies. Wow 
Cotnics. Comic book sales were 
booming, and artists and 
writers were frantically 
creating new characters in an 
effort to keep up witb tbe 
demand. 

Kane, already working on 
severalatrips for: Wow Comics, 
pulled the "man-bat" fra,ment 
from his mind and combined it 
witb other elements, sucb as a 
secret identity and a cave 
hideaway from Zorro and the 
Lone Ranger. 

He named the character the 

Batman. But comics pubUlhers 
didn't realile the Batman's 
appeal immediately. Just as 
two other YOUDI comic book 
creators at the same time were 
haviDl trouble selUq their 
creation, Superman, Kane's 
new bero w,a rejected by 
several companies. 

Then, in 1939, he sold his 
creation to National Period-
icals (now called DC Comics) , 
and tbe rest was bistory. 

In the 39 years since, the 
Batman has starred before four 
generations of Americans in 
comic books and novels, on 
television and movie screens. 

In town over tbe summer at 
tbe San Diego Comic Book 
Convention a~ for the opening 
of an exhibition of bis work at a 
local art gallery, Kane spoke 
about bis superhero, his life in 
comic books, comic art in 
general and his future. 

Looking quite tanned and 
self-assured, Kane, now almost

60, attracted quite a crowd of 
admirers and autograph-
seekers during his viait. 

Kane, wbo worked on the 
Batman comics until the mid-, 
sixties, said be stopped readiDl 
comic books after he dropped 
out of tbe industry. 

"I'm vain," he said. "I didn't 
want to ~ad it after I stopped 

working on it." 
He aJso indicated his disgust 

for people wbo have worked on 
Batman since his departure. He 
called ' tbem · "ghost artists," 
and said tbey are ruining the 
character because they are no 
longer following the direction 
his own work set down. 

• 
"Those .&uys, with one 

exception (Marshall Rogers) , 
are only emulating themselves. 
Any resemblance to Batman in 
their work is purely coinci-
dental," he said. 

Still, Kane said he has bigb 
opinions about comic art. 

"Comic art is the truest and 
first form of fine art," ..be said. 
"It takes us back to the art of 
the cavemen and tbe Egyp-
tians. It is the first form of art-
the linear line of pictures on 
cave walls. 

"Moreover, it also traces the 
mores of our times. By reading 
comic strips since the tum of 
the century you can follow tbe 
morals of each generation, 
their dress and speech pat-
terns." 

It's not hard to understand 
Kane's pride in comic art, and 
his own work, in particular. He 
has worked as a cartoonist 
since his boyhood, when he did 
drawings for bakery ads in the 
Bronx. After that, he worked in 
animation, with the famous 
Fleischer studios, on cartoons 
such as Betty Boop. 

In addition, Kane ' s work 
came primarily in tbe years 
before comics were accepted as 
real works of art. He worked in 
the comic book industry from 
its beginnings, through the 
years when the occupation 
"comic book artist" was 
greeted by scorn and <terision 
from most people, even those 
who avidly read comics in their 
childhoods. 

Then, Kane dropped out of 
comics just before the real 
boom, before art galleries like 
the one now exhibiting Kane's 
work would have ever consid-
ered such an exhibition. 

Now, though, comics are tbe 
vogue, in many different media 
besides comic books them-
selves, and Kane is being hailed 
in most circles as a true 
creator. His powerful and 
highly stylized work is being 
hung and sold-for big bucks-
in galleries across the country. 
People flood to see him at 
conventions such as the San 
Diego Comic-Con. Reporters 
make appointments to inter-
view him, for newspapers and 
television stations. 

In short, Kane, after 40 years, 
is an important person, and 
he's making the most of it. 

And people are listening to 
him, even when he said-as he 
did in one interview here this 
summer-that he considers 
himself a modem American 
version of Picasso or Renoir. 

Yet, just as the Batman Is 
also playboy philanthropist 
Bruce Wayne, there is another, 
less arrogant side to Kane. 

He is also a philanthropist. 
He is currently using his 
artistic talents to aid various 
c haritie s, by selling his 
paintings for the ir rund-raising 
benefits. The first such benefft 
is for UNICEF this month in 
New York .

out value coming acroaa like 
the amartaaa fraternity crudity 
of film maker John Waters 
(Pl .... Flamlalos. Female

sense of humor these days goes 
beyond the intellectually 
justifiable need to poke fun at 
the vacuous materialism 
people surround themselves in 
and lingers upon cbeap-sbot 
vulgarity. He has no points to ' 
make, has no cleverness to 

everyone be ever liked, 
including Bob Dylan, OUI 
RecIcfl .... Van Morrt.on, Bob 
Seger (circa '.). The lack of 
focus causes his songs to sound 
like empty, dramaturlical

Who Are Y 011-Tbe Who (MCA) 

WIIo Are You ia easily the 
best album these guys have 
done in years. Townshends' 
songwriting displays more 
musical variety and lyrical wit 
than it has in some time. He 
seems to have recovered from 
the sourpuss, curmudgeon 
seriousness that ruined his 
work on Quadraphenia and Tbe 
Wbo by Numbers, easily two of 
the most forgettable works 
ever released by a top-rated -
band. Roger Daltry's singing 
has lost all of its nuance, with 
wbat remains of his voice being 
little more than a callous 
bellow, but at least he's offset 
by the generally high quality of 
the material and thus ignor-
able. John EntwhistJe and 
Keith Moon as well play with a 
new found verve , re-t9king 
their place as one of the 
sturdiest bass·drums teams in 
the business. Still, the album in 
general has a feel of despera-
tion to it, as though the Who 
were out to prove that there's 
still life in their middle-aged 
bones. It's doubtful that they' ll 
ever dredge up enough energy 
to put something out like this 
again . They are no doubt 
depleted of their drive and 
motivation to rock ar.d roll. The 
Who have nothing more to 
prove.B plus. 

******** 
Peter Gabriel (Atlantic) 

For reasons known only to 
himself, Peter Gabriel has 
given his second album the 
same self-named title as his 
first. Sadly, the similarities end 
there. Where the first.albums 
had all the superlatives 
worldng overtime in a vain 
attempt to get across how 

genius for harmony, collective 
improvisation, bard rock 
inserts, and strident ensemble 
work that stands beside the best 
of Ornette Coleman. Zappa as 
well reveals a splendid ear for 
the pleasing melody in "Sofa 
No.1", a deceptively simple 
piece that goes through three 
movements, and which amaz-
ingly has a KiDi Curtl.s--style 
sax solo in the middle. 

"Seger's audience is mostly working class wbo 
baven·t the time to delve into the floating crap 
game called abstraction." 

In total, Zappa ia New York is 
a display case of his best 
abilitiea and bls worst ten-
dencies. One prays for the day 
when he won't feel compeUed to 
buttreaa bis efforts witb 
dispensible obscenity. As the 
situation stands, bowever, the 
Zappa fans will bave to 
continue to take the wbeat with 
the chaff. A mia •.

a faintly fetching ballad where 
Seger draws a weak analogy 
between" a gambler's life" and 
ce.rtain procastinating individ-
uals wbo continually hedge 
their beta (and thus remain 
"still the same"). 

"Good Old Rock and Roll" is 
a rather empty bit of Big Beat 
bubris wherein Seger doles out 
the predictable praise for his 
choaen profession. Only on 
"Feel Like a Number" does 
Seger break out of the album's 
banality and connect with 
something his listenen might 
use. In tbis case, Seger 
articulates the alienation of the 
"common folk" over tbeir 
feeling denatured of their 
individuality in a world ruled 
by numbers, from Social 
Security and Internal Revenue,

By Dave Zielinski 
and Ted Burke 

t all started on one of those lethargic Sunday 
evenings when there's nothing more to do 
than listen to the refrigerator buzz, watch 
"Green Acres" reruns and snuff heat-

spawned insects with worn-out rubber bands. (" ... Times 
Square .. .fresh air ... SPLAT ... ") 

Gerry Jarry and Joe Rimbaud were lounging around the 
apartment, lingering over their favorite literary 
fantasies . One of these involved infiltrating an established 
in-group of writers (one of which San Diego must possess, 
they swore) and impressing them with schemes for 
conquering the East Coast publishing world. Another was 
coming across 'a pair of beautiful women who would take 
them home after being smitten with various who-gives-a-
rat's,ass interpretations of obscure dead authors Gerry 
and Joe had never read. 

Despite the recent explosion of estrous-infused Spring!n 
America 's finest city, their luck with women had been ml. 
So they sublimated instead, ranting on about projected 
novels and possible screenplays. 

Eventually, their talk came back around to discovering 
the heart of the Iiterart scene in San Diego. There had to be 
other bright and brilliant scribes in this metropolis, 
writers who could sling words as well as they could, who 
were just as obsessed with Hemingway's ghost and 
Woolf's last gurgle. Where did the purveyors of pungent 
and poignant prose gather to share sensitive renderings of 
a senseless reality with like-minded sorts? S ighing, Gerry opened up last week's Reader to the " Local Events" section. " We've got to do something," he said trailing his finger up and down the columns like the needle on a 
seismograph. " Here we go, how about this? 'Androgynous 
Body Repair workshop for VW Owners and Reader 
Personals Basket Cases.' " 

" Naw," yawned Joe. A rotten rubber band snapped 
against his thumb as he aimed at a fly wandering around 
Ava Gabor's cleavage. 

" We could take in a play," continued Gerry. "Here' s-one 
called 'Waiting For The End of The World.' It's a 
theatrica . interpretation of Spengler's Decline of the West 
in 427 acls accompanied by Elvis Costello albums played 
over and oVer." 

Joe sheok his head. 
Gerry tried again. " This lecture sounds pretty good. 

'Neo-McCarthyism: The PIf~Asures 01 ~ed-Baiting in. ~he 
'70 's.' It'~ followed by a slide show of Cuban war atrOCities 
in Zaire. T is thing's sponsored by the National Enquirer 
and the El(~on Corporation, 10 it mWit be good." J • 

Joe wa ' ipvolved in his own jungle warfare, ~urdenng a 
gaggle 0: tnosquitoes with a flurry of smokIng rubber. 
"Can't d~al with it," he mumbled. 

Gerry could barely contain his delight when he read the 
next announcement. " This is it! This is what we're lookin~ 
for " he cried. "Listen up: The India Street Poetry Th~ater. All local poets are invited to read from their 
work. Every Sunday at seven p.m.' This has to be where all 
the writers congregate." . 

"So who writes peotry?" asked Joe, settine down his 
latex arsenal. 

"You mean you don't have any poems?" Gerry was 
suddenly distraught. "Well, neither do I. But that's not 
going to stop us. Get out our typewriters and lash them 
together back to back. Then load' em up with paper while I 
run out. for a couple of six packs. When I get back we'll 
have just enough time to dash off tonight's poetic opus 
before they get underway at India Street." 

" Whatever you say." 
When Gerry returne": ·.,,;th a ~hopping bag full of Schlitz 

Tall Boys, Joe had moved all the furniture back against 
the walls. In the middle of the room sat a card table 
surrounded by every light. lamp and lantern in the house. 
The two typewriters gleamed with the same reflected 
incandescence one finds in hospital delivery rooms. 

Flinging pop tops skyward and leaping into their chairs, 
Gerry and Joe got right to work. The clatter of the keys 
went non-stop, punctuated by the clang of bells, the 
screech of returned carriages, the peal of extracted pages. 
It wasn't long before they heaped up a stack of primal 
poetics that a young Bukowski would be proud of. 

Bundling up the papers and yanking most of the beers 
out of the fridge, they made ready to leave. "Man, those 

guys aren't going to know what hit 'em," gerry bragged. 
" Calm down, ace." Joe tossed his counterpart another 

can of brew. It tumbled end over end before being caught. 
" We've got to get sufficiently fortified before the. assa~lt. 
If this thing is like any of the other poetry readIngs I ve 
wandered into, we'll need all the grog we can hold down 
just to put up with their cancerous sensitivity." 

Gerry laughed in agreement,~~~~~~~~~ 
ripping open his beer can. A foamy 
white stream spuzzed across the 
bookshelf, soaking a dilapidated 
copy of Man's Fa'e. 

They drank as much as they could 
hold, at the risk of massive internal 
injury, and then trundled out to the 
car. It was a crisp summer night and 
the sun was just slipping below the 
horizon. The retreating orb splashed 
the wisps of lingering stratus clouds 
with bright reddish-orange, much 
the same color as the KGB Chicken's 

tailfeathers. 
Careening out of the driveway, 

sloshing beer across the dashboard, 
they headed for the nearest onramp. 
Lights from the freeway sparkled off 
the bottom of their Tall Boy cans as 
Gerry muscled into the fast lane. 

Their belles-lettres friskiness was complimenfed by a 
hedonistic sense of good will. For this reason Gerry 
stopped to snatch up a hitchhiker near Hotel Circle. Cars 
whooshed past as the newcomer carefully slipped into the 
back seat. He presented an uncommon sight , 
immaculately attired in a European-style tailored suit, 
toying with a gold-tipped cigarette. Politely refusing a 
sample of Schlitz, the hitchhiker proceeded to state his 
business. 

"I'm in the restaurant game," he announced, as Gerry 
rejoined the traffic. "I've just been diaculllDl tbe

prospect of opening a chain of dri~e-through philosophical 
fast food emporiums." 

Gerry and Joe grunted their approval. 
"You gentlemen seem to possess a modicum of 

intelligence. I'd like to get your reaetion to some of our 
ideas." 

Swallowing more suds, they nodded for him to continue. 
"We think San Diego is quite ripe for this gimmick. We 

wallt to serve a tasty array of 'burgers augmented by an 
elaborate salad bar. We're going to call itTheSartreSalad 
Bar adorned with the message: 'How many nauseating nua~ces will you choose to concoct?' " 

"Esoteric, but interesting," Joe acknowledged. 
"Hmmm, yes." He puffed gingerly at his smoke. "We'll 

also offer The Cartesian Burger. 'It's greasy, therefore it's 
good.' And how about the Existential Burger? 
'Subjectively scrumptious.' " 

"Not bad." Gerry changed lanes. . 
"But there's more. Like the 'Dreadfully Delicious 

Heide-Burger.' And of course ou,r Spengler Burger. 'It 
declines in your mouth, not in your hand." He animatedly 
extinguished bll ci,arette. "Com'on, guys. What do you 
think of this? The Hegel Burger. 'Don't try and understand 
it, just eat it.' " 
"Great," Gerry said. "How far you going?" 
"Not far. Near Pt. Lorna ," he sighed. G erry drove out of their way to drop the hitchhiker off at his destination. It turned out he was attellding the red-baiting lecture they had read about earlier. A local elementary 
school was housing the event, which was drawing 
quite a croWd. The parking lot was jammed with RVs and 
four-wheel drive trucks sporting "Sierra Club Go Hike To 
Hell" bumper stickers, ~Iong with a flock of Cadillacs 
bedazzled with "Yes On 13" banners. One reckless 
individual had this message gracing the rear of his 
vehicle: "I'd Rather Be Waging Imperialist Warfare In 
The Jungles of Underdeveloped African Nations." 

"Neo-McCartbylsm: Tbe Pleasures of Red 
Baitinl in tbe '70s. It's foUowed by a slide 
show of Cuban war atrocities in Zaire." 

They quickly doubled back and returned to the ~reeway . 
It was getting close to zero hour. Gerry set down hiS beer to 
point out of the window. " There it ~s, over t~ere," he ~aid, 
motioning toward a COngloJeratJon of brightly paInted 
cottages. 

Joe laughed ... For a minut !thought we were in Mission 
Beach. That looks more Iik Enchantedland at Belmont 
Park." I 

"So if you had a couple of days to put together an 
appealingly unpretentious yet apparently spontaneous art 
colony, what would you make it look like? " 

"I suppose you've got a pOint there." 
The reading was being hel4 in a cute little bungalow just 

behind a row of stores. These shops were decked in a 
multitude of rude colors, establishing pseudo-art deco 
around and across the original facades. 

Gerry and Joe climbed a cement stairway which took 
them deeper into the mysterious depths of the colony. 
They had passed through the street-level barricade of 
shops, but how many mort levels ~ould .they have to 
transcend, how many more byrinthme tWists and turns 
would they have to make, be re encountering what it was 
they so eagerly sought? 

Stumbling onto the porch, the sack of Schlitz 
and the sheaf of poetry, greeted by the resonant 
thump of an acoustic bass, strums of a ten·dollar guitar 
and the lilting e DC a hunt-and-peck flautist. 

O nce inside, they the three musicians seated at the side of a large living room. Most of the was pushed to the walls. In chairs and two overstuffed couches 
sat various folks a determined bohemian 
simulation. Young and old alike, all striving for 
pleasing variations of ~he basic unifo~, wore loose-
fitting Mexican weddmg faded stnng pants and 
sandals or shoes without . Jade and turquoise 
jewelry adorned nearly visible appendage. 
Neglected beards, u mustaches and an 
assortment of earrin cora ted the collective 
countenance, not to profusion of wire-rimmed 
glasses. Much of the neat little folders and 
bulging notebooks as if sacred tomes. 

Gerry and Joe paused, this all in, when a slight 
old man, attired in a gaudy shirt and clamdigger 
trousers approached them, ha~d ~xt,ended. J:le look~d 
like an aged extra from claSSIC 50 s beatmk mOVie, 
Bucke' Of Blood. 

"Welcome," he said. ' 're both new, I believe, so 
why don't you sign in and a seat. Please. And I see 
you're going to read. w" .... r .. I" His voice had the 
brusque tone of a drill tempered with obll,atory 
meUoW1Ml8l. 

"Yeah, we've ,ot some rr here," into~ed Gerry. 
Joe opened up the beer bIIIl'nd offered a TaU Boy to the 

poetllined up OD the was declined with a 
motion that implied the 01 the caD being 
encysted with pia .... 

The GUlirdian 

..... we'll need all the 11'01 we can bold down 
. just &0 put up wltb their cancerous 

&Wensltl"ity." 

The old man continued: "Yes, you're going to read. 
Good, good, v~ry good. I'm very happy to have new poets 
come to our readings. It makes so much more sense to 
what we do here. You'd be surprised how many excellent 
poets there are in this city who feel that they have no public 
outlet for their writings. I'm trying to get their poetry out 
of the closet because, as you know, a poem isn't a poem, it 
isn't art, until it's sounded out in front of other poets . 
Poetry is another form of speech, the highest form of 
speech if you will, because it captures the most private 
parts of the human mind. " He began moving his arms 
about in wider and wider circles, drawing the attention of 
the assembled crowd to his discourse like sweeping a pile 
of dust under the rug. "Yes, the most private parts, in a 
beautiful form that's tangible to anyone who can feel the 
beauty of words structured in a certain special manner. 
And there's no reason to think that anyone who can hear 
and talk won't be able to dig where another poet's coming 
from . ..poets are afraid, man, and I'm trying to show them 
that there's nothing, absolutely nothing, for them to be 
afraid of. I want these poets to sound themselves out, to 
give their all! " He stopped for effect. Seeing that all eyes 
were finally upon him, the old man finished with what he 
hoped would be a flourish. "Yes, give their all . And I hope 
that's why you're here tonight." 

"Yes sir," said Gerry. 
There was scattered applause and the old man bowed 

slightly, stifling a cough. 
Gerry and Joe squeezed into empty places on the 

couches and waited for the show to start. The old man 
signalled for silence and then introduced another old man 
who was hunkered down behind a tattered lampshade. 
Reading Crom a decrepit copy of Vachel Lindsay poems, 
this second geezer wheezed through a lengthy piece, 
something about China and firecrackers. His warbling 
monotone made it seem as if he was receiving a slow, 
orgasm-delaying enema rather than reading poetry. 

Gerry dug out a beer for Joe, tossing it half the length of 
the room. They popped their tops in . tandem, adding an 
interesting percussive effect to the meanderings of the 
jazz accompanists. 

Grandpa was offered polite applause before a plump 
Mexican woman took the stage. She wore huge crescent 
moon earrings as big as cookies, going for the gypsy effect. 
Murmuring something about picking out a book at random 
from her shelf at home, she proceeded to open said book to 
a random page. Gratefully, she read the poem as it was 
written, avoiding the next logical steps of picking out 
words at random, travelling up and down the page , 
realduu! the book dow etc. 

S he was followed by a yawnfest of obscure imagists, non-sequitur moralists and free-form romantics who offered nothing more than wilted word salad. But they were giving 
their aU. Gerry tried to ImaliDe the forlorn closets out of whlcb 
these poems had come. . 

And speaking of forlorn, Joe was ou and out despairing 
when he discovered he had drained off the last drop of 
beer. Under cover of yet another babbling bard, he made 
good his exit and sauntered down to tht! nearest liquor 
store. He returned some time later with a crackling cold 
bottle of aDDle wine. But before he had a chance to oPen it, 
M ~aUIed that the reaellDJ W81 over. Somepae had turned 
on more lights and the musicians were packing up their 
kit. 

Joe sought out his friend. "But Gerry, what about our 
stuff?" 

.. Are you kiddin,? This whole thiDl is a Jest." 
"Yeah, but those poema of oun will never become art 

un1eu we spit 'em out. II 
"DoD't make me laugh," 

,.g. 38 
As would be expected, the poets and the audience began 

mingling and an organic mutual admiration society slowly 
took shape. Constructive criticism wasJimiled to assorted 
cosmic giggles and an occassional "for sure" or " really" . 

Not to be outdone, the old man again took up a position in 
the center of the room. He looked like some ancient farmer 
about to spread around a few handfuls of chicken feed for 
his hungry fowl. " Please, everyone. We're passing the hat 
now, as we do every week . Jfyou'd like to contribute we'd 
certainly appreciate it . Please ." His affected 
"mellowness""was now noticeabh~ absent. . 

As the hat made its rounds, Joe took the old man's spot. 
Clearing his throat and hoisting his bottle high, Joe 
commanded everyone's attention as he loudly started an 
improvisational diatribe: " While the serpent of your 
dreams/Lulls you into evil sleep/ I pluck this barren 
fruit! And consume it on the eve of your destruction. " 

Joe brought his bottle down and drank from it greedily . 
Gerry joined him, ripping the wine from Joe's grasp and 
crying out: " If paradise be lost/Then let us cast 
ourselves/Into the piteous beauty/Of beautiful pity." 

Gerry swilled down a gulletful and then waved the bottle 
around the room like a priest swinging a censer. 

"The beer was declined with a motion tbat 
implied the possibility of tbe can being 
encysted witb plague." 

The startled frowns of the audience soon dissolved into 
'appreciative smiles. Mounting applause was peppered 
with yelps of praise. The audience closed in and 
surrounded Gerry and Joe in thanks. 

B ut this joyous moment was soon eclipsed as th~ old man appeared again, crawling out ' from between someone's legs. He held up the empty hat, brushing off a dusty footprint from 
its brim. The only sound in the room was that of the 
remnants of the apple wine swishing in the bottom of the 
bottle as Gerry continued to swirl it about. 

Calculating, the old man waited for his eyes to fill with 
mounting fury before snatching up the bottle and dashing 
it to the ground. "Get the fuck out of my house!" he 
bellowed. While his words still echoed through the shabby 
abode, Gerry and Joe ~Ieefully hot-footed it out the door. 

Once on the street, they returned to Gerry's car and 
leaned on the hood . They tried their best to imitate restless 
teenage delinquents who were all dressed up with no place 
to go. Gerry reached into the back seat and dug out the 
three remaining Tall Boys. Joe was sprawled across the 
hood, reeling with drunken rapture. His stomach sloshed 
around the unruly rem.ruf!S.of his last meal. Gerry placed a 
can in Joe's open hand and wrapped his fingers around it. 

"Jeez," lamented Gerry, " that whole scene is a 
vacuum. It never ceases to amaze me, the things people 
put up'with in the name of art. All hope for communication 
sacrificied for baroque vagueness." 

" You got it," said Joe , raising himself up, fumbling 
with the Tall Boy ring tab. "For some reason I knew I 
shouldn't expect much more. I guess we're just trying to 
live out somebody else's literary history. But.. ." Joe's 
voice trailed off as he looked to the sky, his gaze eventually 
focusing on the downtown skyline. The rows of office 
windows looked like airholes cut into a shoe box used to 
transport a kid 's pet hamster to second grade show-and-
tell. They glowed in the austere white aura of strategically 
placed floodlights that caused the night sky to appear 
radioactive. 

"The rows of office windows looked like 
airholes cut into a shoe box used to transport 
a kid's pet hamster to second grade sbow-
and-tell. " 

JQ:4t ~P.l!tg~~jt t$!. ~~I!.I!. tt1.4t gl(l ~I ~.9J1~' JIQ~l .. He cal!Jbt 
sight of the outdoor glass elevator that inched towards the 
Sky Room, creeping slowly like a spider making its way up 
a curtain cord. 

"Shit," he said atIast. " We're just on the fringe. I heard 
that a lot a local artists are moving in downtown, taking 
advantage of cheap rents . Why don't we just forget this 
poetry scam and delve deeper into the heart ofthe beast?" 

"We got nothing to lose. " Gerry shredded up his stack of 
poems into .the smallest pieces PQssible. He threw this 
lyric confetti into the air. The bits of paper were dispersed 
by a sudden gust of wind blowing in from the freeway. 

So they got into the car and pointed themselves toward 
the glowing skyline. They agreed that soon they would be 
visiting their Xanadu, their Mt. Olympus MV "me ~ t 
seat of their quest, finally enjoying that pantheon of 
pleasure, Downtown San Diego.

The Scripps Beach Cottage 
has earned a notorious reputa-
tion for its Friday afternoon 
TGIF parties. Use or tbls 
facility for social activities by 
graduate students at SIO was 
reluctantly granted by hesitant 
University . officials before it 
was discovered that a graduate 
student's idea of having a good 
time is participation in a circle 
jerk. Grads tend to tire quickly 
of undergraduates who crash 
their affairs and have in the 
past successfully utilized a 
clever ploy to dispose of them. 
Handbills are printed up and 
distributed amongst the 
partiers to lure them to a 
nonexistent moonlight party on 
Black's Beach, from which 
police statistics confinn it is 
unlikely that anyone will return 
alive. 

Off-campus parties, particu-
larly those in North County, are 
usually too intense for the 
average undergrad , and 
although sporadically through· 
out the year handbills and 
word-of-mouth will advertise 
unlimited free beer, three 
bands and an after-party orgy, 
the sad fact is that such p.arties 
are propagated by those who 
have devoted their lives to two 
principles: that Nirvana can be 
reached through the con -
sumption of near-lethal doses of 
alcohol and that the center of 
one's physical and spiritual 
being lies in the vicinity of the 
crotch. Avoid these affairs and 
their organizers, unless you 
feel that you can establish a 
meaningful rapport with · 
someone who spends 75% of his 
life " steering the porcelain 
wheel". 

Having established the 
inherent pitfalls to be avoided 
when selecting a party site, let 
us examine the last remaining 
recourse available to the 
student for weekend fun, the on-
campus beer bust. Usually 
located in a dormitory lounge 
or a rented room at the student 
center, the primary function of 
these get-togethers is to 
facilitate peaceful coexistence 
between students who will be 
stuck with each other for nine 
months. A secondary purpose, 
of course, is to imbibe toxic 
amounts (If grog, especially an 
effective method of eliciting 
congenial though vacuous 
conversation when augmented 
with loud rock music and an 
asphyxiating quantity of 
cigarette smoke. Naturally , 
there are di.advantages to 
excessive attendance of auch 
affairs, as the probability of 
hangovers, teen-a,e preg-
nancy, arrest, dru, overdoee, 
and venereal disease increases 
logarithmically.

It W81 the first local anes-
thetic discovered. brinlinl a 
great deal of attention to the 
drug, for tbe sur,ical and 
dental uses were obvious. Tbe 
anesthetic action occurs in the 
peripheral nervous system by 
blocltiOi the neurona transient

sodium ions necessary for 
transmission of nerve im-
pullel. The dentist I. still 
dilling through your tooth pulp 
nerve, but the information 
never reaches your brain, so 
you don't feel it. Hence, the 
gummer. 

Tbe more interesting aspect 

mort that can really tell the 
purity of the powder they use. 
Given that the neurochemical 
basis of ampbetamine and 
(.'()(:aine action are quite bard to 
dlItIquIIb, It may be that a 
large portion of the "unique" 
coke bi,b comes from tbe 
anticipations, needs, and 
beUefa of the user.

There's this intense culture 
that g08l aloOl with cocaine. 
Vials, scales, grams, razor 
blades, mirrors, rolled and 
unrolled ,100 bills, tenalon, nose 
doucbes, pie ~s of slick maga-
zine paper tolded to look like 
table footballs . They say 
unfolding, chopping, and Unlng 
up a tram Is as fun as snorliDl 
it. Well, maybe not 81 fun, but 
it's nice. RinI, riDl, rlDi. "Hey 
man, can I score a 'g'? AU 
rlgbt! (click) . He's ,ot some, 
says It's da kine, Peruvian. I'll 
go score it. If Everyone pulls out 
their contribution and you wait. 
Already everyone's hi,h off the 
context. Tbe coke arrives. The 
Van Gogh comes down off the 
wall and the powder spills out 
on the glass. "Looks Uke a ,ood 
,ram, could be point nine." 
Someone takes a blade and 
powders the powder, turns it 
Into Unes wbile everybody elae 
hoven around the table and 
room Ilke animals around a kill. 
Heavy breatbing, sweating, 
some nerves, but the blow wlll 
solve all the bassles. 

.. At first, tooting was a real 
kick in the head. At a party, one 
of those graduate student 
parties, someone would hold 
forth in the bathroom with a 
razor blade and mirror, doUng 
out generous lines for whoever 
wanted to cram a dollar up 
their nose. I'd do about three 
lines of this stuff in succession, 
and' after the usual stuff about 
worrying wbether you're gonna 
get off or not, the snow would 
take bold. The back of my neck 
would tighten, as . though· 

"I'd do about three lines of this stuff in 
succession, and after the usual stuff about 
worrying whether you're gonna get off or not, 
the snow would take hold." 

of cocaine's action, the "high", 
is less well understood. It 
occurs tbrou,b cocaine's 
working in the ·brain, and 
probably by much the same 
mechanism as ampbetamines, 
by .biflinl the chemical brain 
into overdrive. Tbe cate· 
cholamlnes, chemicals used by 
the braID to trsnamit infor-
mation acl'Oll the space be-
tween neuroDS, normally act 
for only a few m1lIiseconda 
before they are inactivated by 
belOl reabsorbed by the nerve 
that releued them. Cocaine 
slows this reuptake mecbanism 
and coDlequently the action of 
the neurotraDllDitter Is poten-
tiated. If the information the 
traDllllltter was Involved in 
proceuiq was "feel hiIh", 
theD the iIlteDlity of the feeling 
wID IDereue. ExplanatioDl of 
tbe action of maDY drugs, 
includlnl cocaiDe, are In large 
part speculative at tbI. point, 
simply becaUM not enoup is 
known aboUt the fUDCtlons and 
IDtrlcacles of the buman brain. 

JUit knowin, that you're 
snorting cocaine can facilitate 
the nature of the high. And it 
doelD't eveD have to be cocaine 
you're snorting. It'l probably a 
smaU percentile of those who 

someone had appUed a clamp 
and were intent on crushing my 
skull like an over-ripe tomato, 
and then tbe back of my throat 
would back up with phlegm and 
other crud. Since coke has a 
propensity to heighten your 
sense., sounds In the room got 
louder, conversation amona the 
grad students became more 
boisterous, and lhe lights 
seemed brighter, stabbing my 
eyes. My mlDd would start 
raclna a mile a minute, and my 
thoughts would become an orgy 
of half-formed ideas and 
promises of future projects I'd 
undertake, such as wrltlna a 
book about a number of topics I 
knew nothln, about. But I 
couldn't wait. I'd get up and 
invade the conversations, 
feellOl Uke the ,realest guy in 
the world, pearls of brilUance 
Ipilling from my mouth like 
saliva. Jesus, whatdIdD" I talk 
about? LIterature, art, poUtlcs, 
philosophy, films, television 
shows, comic boob, musie, 
anythiDi that came to mind. I 
rattled off as much stuff as I 
could remember from a dispa-
rate number of books I'd read 
over the years . For a few 
minutes, I felt like the smartest 
man in lhe world, with a skull 

pulsing and buzzing with 
insl,ht and knowledge that 
could cut through the bullshit 
and get to the meal pf the 
matter. It was as if the wisdom 
of the cosmos had lodged 
themselves inside my head ... 
The blgh began to wane, of 
course, and feeliDi my new 
power and intelUgence drain-
iDI away, I returned to the 
bathroom for a few more lines. 
I wanted to maintain tbe crest I 
was rldiDi.

I did that all night, and the 
par1Y eventually shrank to a 
few people sitting around the 
room in a weird silence while 
the stereo blasted rock and roll 
and a mirror and a dollar bill 
were passed around metho-
dically . We did that until 
sunrise. It was strange. My 
mind had been stripped of all of 
its defenses, with the cocaine 
first removing my inhibitions 
and then working its way down 
to the core of my ego. By 
sunrise, I was beyond talk, 
guilt, self-reOection, despair, 
joy, aDything. It was as though 
I'd reached some Idnd of Zen 
state where all my emotions 
and attitude. towards my life's

felt as though I'd come to an 
acceptance of myself as being a 
fundamentally worthless entity

(e_lla.ell ...... pqe U) 
I bated it 10 mucb I didn't even' 
want to lbink about it. For the 
IIlOIt part. however, it ia the 
choice of material, not the 
acting, that is atrocioua at Cal 
Pac. Unfortunately they bave 
already begun the new season 
on the I8IIIe wrong foot with a 
brilliantly acted, but horribly 
dated play, "Streamers". 
ThiDp milht improve -by the 
end of the season when" Aabea" 
is produced-even if they only 
do it balf as well as TIle Mark 
T .... r ... did it twOlealODl 
bact. StudeDl ruIb ticteta are 
,1.75 011 the eveDiq of the 
performance. 

TIle Eaa Cou&y PerfOl'llliaI 
ArIa Caler is a IODI way off in 
EI Cajon, but it imports a 
variety o( acts-usually only. 
for a night or tw~that are 
often very good . Patricia 
McBride and Jean-Pierre 
Bonnefous o( the New York City 
Ballet will present a "Bal-
anchine Evening," Friday, 
October 6. Watch the papers (or 
other events. 

The Marq •• Public TIIea&re 
on India Street also handles a 
lot of short-term productions, 
and the quality depends on the 
particular group using the 
theatre. This is where you' ll 
find off-beat kinds of going-
ons-Women's theatre (no 
nasty letters, please), Insom-
niac's theatre, Chicano theatre 
and so on. 

Tile SaD Diet. Playpen 
Serle. at tbe Fox Theatre, 
dowDtown, takes us into the 
realm of high ticket prices, 
sometimes for low quality 
shows. These are road shows 
that I am talking about~where 
the cast bas been fattening up 
for tix months on a diet of 
Denny'. and McDonald'., and 
where the star, you discover to 
your chagrin, is only a baa-
been. I used to love "South 
Pacific" before I saw Howard 
Keel sputter aDd stumble 
through the role of Emile. On 
the other hancl, "The Wb" wu 
a delilhtJul surprise. So it'. 
hard to predict what the 
PlaYloers will come up with. I 
refer anyone iDterested in 
making this kind of investment 
to the sale writinCJ of the local 

theatre critics. But read all of 
them, not just one, because 
diacovering the truth of the 
matter ia a dialectical process, 
and sometimes a critic caD be 
dead wrong, or biased, or 
asleep when he "saw" the 
perfonnance . 

There are two rival ballet 
companies in SaD Dieg~ The 
Sa. Dlel. Balle& and the 
Calif ..... Ballet. I am loyal, 
tbouth not necessarily partial, 
to the fonner. Su DieIO Ballet, 
at least, manages to lure guest 
artists, and the first of these 
will be Fernando Bujones of 
ABT and Ann Marie De Angelo 
'of the Joffrey Ballet who will 
give, along with the regular 
company, three perfonnances 
of a program that includes the 
"I.e Corasire" pas de deux 
(movie-goers will remember 
this as the piece de resistance of 
"The Turning Point" .) 

Ballet in San Diego is 
expensive, but not as expensive 
as opera . Besides charging 
exorbitant ticket prices, The 
San Diego Opera receives a 
colossal amount of money from 
Combo, our local lundin'g 
organization. This allows them 
to import guest stars such as 
Beverly Sills and Ilresent some 
pretty jim-crack productions. 
If you decide your pocketbook 
can stand a visit to the Civic 
Center box office, at least read 
the libretto of the opera (if you 
are not familiar with it) before 
you go to the show. That way, 
even if they are singing in 
Italian, you'll remember what 
you read in English, and pretty 
soon the Italian will start 
sounding like Englisb and 
you'll be well 01.\ your way to 
understanding why some 
people actu{llly like to listen to a 
lot of garbled nonsense sung in 
some foreign language that 
might as well be Chinese for all 
the difference you can tell. 

So much forSan Diego. I bave 
twice mentioned The Mark 
Taper Forum in Los Angeles, 
aDd would like to empbasize 
that I bave never regretted the 
drive up there. It II my favorite 
place to go and its productions 
are consiatently excellent. I 
can't imaline ever being a 
Jl'OUcb over a Taper show.
