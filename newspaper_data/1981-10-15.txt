The Problem Roomate 

BY CARMELITA RO AL 
Staff Writer 

Coping with an intense academic load is only a part 
of t he typical student' . I ife. Living wit h roommate' i . 
another. 

Most sl udents have the notion that living away from 
home gi es them the chance to "do their own thing." 
However, some ·tudents lose s ight of the fact that 
responsibility is a vital part of living harmoniously 
with roommate '. 

There will always be the que 'lion, "Do you have a 
problem roommate?" 

Complaints from a sampling of ·tudent · ranged 
from "it's not my sole responsibility to keep the whole 
place clean," to " I rea lly don't want a third 'roommate' 
in my room on weekend nights." 

The most common gripe of students was me siness. 
This problem stems from students' lack of awareness 
and responsibility to maintain the tidiness ofthe place 
they live in . 

Students living in residence halls do not have to 
bother cleaning their residence hall 'uite becau 'e a 

maintenance staff is hired to do thi~ . 
"Our cleaning lady comes here every morning and 

cleans up the mes that we left the night before," 'aid 
one Revelle student. "I feel a sen ' of guilt when I see 
her put thing ' in order. In the morning, our :uite i ' 0 
nice and clean, but later in th aftern n, magazine ' 
are all over the table, half·emptied 'oft drink can~' are 
on the fl r, and the whole place d 'n't look any 
different before it was cleaned." 

However, ·tudents who live in apartment · on 
campu' have no cleaning taff to depend on; they are 
obliged to do the cleaning them 'elve . 

"I never vacuumed my room when I wa livingin the 
dorm last year," said one Warren tudent. "Either my 
roommate or the cleaning lady did it every week. Now 
that I 'hare an apartment on campu with three other 
roommates, I have to alot some time to do my share of 
maintaining the cleanline ' of the apartment," 'he 
explained.

Pacific News Service 

The US role 
in Saudi Arabia 

BY PAUL McCLOSKEY JR. 
P.clfic New. Service 

President Reagan stands at 
the threshold of our greatest , 
and perhaps last, opportunity 
to achieve a lasting peace 
between the Palestinians and 
Israel. Such a peace requires 
recognition of both the 
Palestinians ' right to a 
homeland and the Israelis' 
right to security, within their 
own borders. Until a 
Palestinian homeland is 
defined and recognized, there 
seems little hope of achieve-
ment of a lasting peace in the 
Middle East. 

The only possible place for a 
Palestinian homeland is on the 
West Bank and in Gaza. The 
autonomy of these areas - the 
government by the Palestini· 
ans living there - was the goal 
of Camp · David, to which 
Menachem Begin agreed. With 
the death of Anwar Sadat it 
seems even more im~rtant 
that his courage in inttiating 
the first Arab·Israeli talks, 
which culminated in Camp 
David, be continued toward 
the ultimate peace which he 
envisioned. 

The Camp David negotia· 
tions broke down over a year 
ago because of three factors: 
(1) the intransigence of the 
Begin government in expand· 
ing Israeli settlements, seizing 
East Jerusalem and opposing 
true autonomy in the West 
Bank, (2) the refusal of King 
Hussein of Jordan to 
participate in the process 
begun at Camp David, and (3) 
the continuing unwillingness 
of Vasser Arafat and the PLO 
to recognize publicly Israel's 
right to exist, thus allowing 
the Israelis to continue to 
refuse negotiations with t he 
PLO as spokesman for the 
Palestinians. 

If Begin , Hussein and Arafat 
are to be moved from 
cont inu ed intransigency 
towards compromise, it is 
clear that the United States 
and the Saudis are the keys. 
The US and Saudi Arabia 
must work together if an 
environment for fruitful 
negotiations is to be created . 

The Saudis and the United 
States are natural allies. 
Despite its relatively small 
population of 7 million and 
v uln erable geographic 
position. centered among the 
Soviet armed and advised 
countrie of Iraq, Libya, 
Ethiopia and South Yeman , 
Saudi Arabia is the most 
stabilizing political entity in 
the volatile Persian Gulf area. 
With 25 percent of the world's 
oil reserves, and more than 
$100 billion annually in oil 
revenue ·, th Saudis are a 

. ( ., . , 

giant oconomic and political 
force. 

We should not forget that 
when OPEC wanted to raise 
oil prices, the Saudis voted to 
keep them down , thus 
assisting the United States' 
fight against inflation. When 
the Iran·Iraq war threatened 
US oil supplies, the Saudis 
obliged us by temporarily 
increasing their production 
despite their national policy to 
maintain a regulated flow of 
oil. It was largely the Saudis' 
oil reserve which, in 1980, 
impelled President Carter to 
commit the United States to 
use military force, if 
necessary, to prevent a Soviet 
or other nation's intrusion into 
the Persian Gulf. 

As well as being a crucial 
source of oil and a bulwark 
against Soviet advances into 
the Gulf countries, however, 
Saudi Arabia has the capacity 
and opportunity to advance a 
posture of negotiation rather 
than of military confrontation 
alone. Just as we give Israel 
nearly $2.2 billion a year in 
military and oconomic aid, the 
Saudis are not likely to retreat 
from their annual $1.4 billion 
assistance to Jordon and 
perhaps an equivalent sum in 
support of the Palestinians. 
The late King Faisal of Saudi 
Arabia once told a group of 
touring US business leaders 
that he would spend every 
dollar of his oil revenues, if 
necessary, to insure that he 
could once again worship in 
the great Islamic temple in 
East Jerusalem undisturbed. 

If the United States and 
Saudi Arabia could agree upon 
and promote a joint policy for 
peace among Israel,j ordan and 
the Palestinians, it seems 
highly probable that those 
countries could agree on a 
series of definitive steps for 
the establishment of a 
Palestinian state on the West 
Bank and Gaza . The state 
could be demilitarized and 
perhaps confederated with, 
but not controlled by, Jordan. 
This agreement would require 
the PLO's recognition of Israel 
and Israeli negotiations with 
the PLO. It might also require 
the same kinds of multina· 
tional or U.N. peacekeeping 
force on the West Bank as we 

'envision in the Sinai between 
Israel and Egypt. 

I would be glad to see US 
troops as part of such a 
peacekeeping force if it were 
an es ential ingredient of a 
permanent Palestinian ·lsraeli 
peace. 

Israel has much to gain by

A Different Angle

A view from the outside 
BY JEFFREY LEE 

Being a recent ~aduate from the University 
of California, one s views are not always in tune 
with the rest of the world. In fact, many of the 
students on campus do not participate actively 
in any type of real life situation, but concentrate 
solely on getting t heir advanced science degrees 
which will put them into the mainstream of life 
with the big bucks in their pockets. 

But there are some who are different. There 
are some who take the way of past scholars and 
stay in subjects like literature and humanities 
only to have the doors of reality slamming in 
their faces when they are suddenly put into the 
job market, and quickly become unemployed. In 
fact, some of them never become employed at 
all. 

The question remains then, as to what we 
should be doing in the college of our choice: 
learning or training. Knowledge in this case, 
that is pure knowledge, has little or no practical 
use, save to make us all the more depressed 
when we find out that the position for 
philosopher closed long ago with the death of 
Socrates. We see our comrades in school driving 
themselves into the ground in the ocmpetition 
of the grades and computer programs 
"borrowed" from other classmates who are 
either ahead of them or smarter than they are. 
We humanities students stop and ask 
ourselves, "Why?" Some of us even ask our 
classmates "why" and the answer is usually, "I 
don't know,l just do it." Sometimes the answer 
is "I want to be rich." 

Is that all there is, we ask ourselves. And as 
we go to our classes in medieval literature we 
are smug in our knowledge that we have

somehow avoided the rat race and the calling of 
money . We are s mug until we graduate. 

Diploma in hand, and sometimes even before 
the document actually gets to the door, we are 
all out there looking for a job. Some of us find 
jobs doing clerical work (typing is a skill that all 
liberal arts majors have picked up from doing 
15·20 pages on everything) or working in some 
kind of menial capacity, such as a truck driver 
or short order cook. And we try to make it on the 
money we make, l»;ause money isn't that 
important to us . We take our lunches, ride the 
bus, or better yet, we walk to work, and when 
we get home, we don't watch TV, we read . 

Along the way, (maybe needing a ride from 
the bus stop), we meet some of our classmates 
who are making $20·30,000 a year and showing 
it by wearing the latest in fashion suits and 
driving cars to suit their tastes, not their 
budgets. They ask us how it's going, and say a 
few of the normal "how's it going stuff," and 
they go in a cloud of dust. We are left to think of 
what our future will be like, and whether or not 
our kid s will be able to go to the college of their 
choice. A wave of sudden depression passes, and 
counting the coins left over from the bus, we 
decide to get a milk shake, and splurge a little. 
After all, we think, things could be worse. We 
could be without the knowledge for which 
Socrates chose to die, and was not really forced . 
Maybe a liberal arts degree wasn't paying off in 
those days either.

Fraternities pose a risk 
Editor: 

Evan Hayward's article on 
the possibi lity of fraternities 
coming to UCSD was very 
interesting, and also just the 
least bi t startling. I have been 
aware of the existence of 
several sorority organizations 
here on campus, but I had no 
idea that anyone was serious ly 
thinking about a ll owi ng 
fraternity and sorority houses 
to be built. Well , if this is really 
a valid consideration . I hope 
that someone does some more 
invest igating of the problems 
involved with frat houses. 
Hayword glossed over the few 
he mentioned , s pending more 
time on the gains that will be 
made by both school and 
society. Fine, I'm all for frat 
houses, if they ca n be 
managed. but I'm not at all 
convinc d that, because of the 
nature of UCSD, frat houses 
and their members aren't 
going to cause some damage . 

A few year., ago in the 
, r J' 

"College Papers" edition of 
Rolling Stone magazine, an 
article appeared on just this 
subject: frat houses and the 
troubles they bring. The 
article cited several examples 
of v iolence which was directly 
linked to frat hou ses, 
especially during the pledge 
rushes. 

Furthermore , the area 
directl y around most frat 
houses was s aid to be in total 
disarray, no doubt s imply by 
the nature of the parties that 
they threw. One has only to go 
as far as SDS U to see examples 
of the kind s of problems that 
are indigenous to fraternities. 
The houses directly around 
the college are disheveled, and 
the yards are always full of 
beer bottles. I don 't see how 
anyone can expect miracles, 
like self·res trained . polite. 
community·oriented f raterni · 
ties. just be ausethisis CSO 
and not SDS{ . ThaI';; not jUst 
heing blind. hut abo blatl'llt 

snobbery . Furthermore , I 
honestly don 't see La Jolla 
welcoming frat houses to the 
university up the s treet. The 
people in La Jolla are rich, but 
not nece ss arily stupid . 
Someone's bound to recognize 
the risks involved with frat s, 
like crime and less·than·c1ean 
living quarters, and stop the 
construction of a frat row just 
like they're stopping low 
income housi ng. 

Ob vious l y, s in ce the 
possible frat houses won 't be 
built until after I'm gone, I 
rea lly have no personal reason 
to try and stop them. If the 
students want fraterni ties and 
the kind of unity that they 
bui ld , t h e n they s hould 
definitely be built, once all the 
consequen ces hav e been 
caref u lly looked at. I don't 
think Hayward really took the 
cons seriousl y, and there are 
just too many of them to 
ignore.

Reagan goes after 
food stamp abusers 

Picking on welfare rocipi-
ents has always been one of 
Ronald Reagan 's favorite 
hobbies . Over the years , we've 
heard him endlessly chastise a 
legendary Chicago welfare 
mother for having 12 Social 
Security cards. 

Our favorite story, however, 
was about t he couple who'd 
moved from California to 
Moscow. Reagan used to claim 
"these cheaters" s till managed 
to cash their California 
welfare checks in the Soviet 
Union . Details never seemed to 
bother the t hen·candidate, but 
it's nearly impossible to cash 
ou t·of·sta te checks in the 
United States - let alone 
London , Paris or Moscow. 

After all the old stories, we 
expected the president to move 
agai nst food stamp cheaters 
once he was sworn in. 

As it happened , however, 
President Reagan continued to 
tell stories about food stamp 
abusers. Instead, under the 
guise of cutting waste and 
fraud, he neglected the real 
abusers and just tightened 
eligibility requirements while 
red ucing benefi ts for 
recipients already in the 
program. As for combating 
true waste, the president 
mimicked his predecessors 

and formed another task force 
to investifate the problem. 

Reagan s inaction perplexed 
many waste fighters in 
Congress and the Carter 
a dmini strat ion . They ' d 
a lread y laid the groundwork 
for cleaning up the f d stamp 
program. Long before Reagan 
was elected , for example, 
Congress tightened food 
stamp eligibility requirements 
for students. 

In its last year, the Carter 
administration issued further 
proposals, but ran out of time 
to implement them. The major 
changes included : 

- Requiring recipients to 
carry photo identification 
cards. 

-Tightening procedures 
under which authorization 
cards are mailed and reissued. 

-Disqualifying wholesale 
food stores from the program 
to prevent large amounts of 
money from possible launder· 
ing. 

Finally , just the other day , 
the Reagan administration 
decided to implement several 
of these measures. In 17 urban 
areas, eligible recipients will 
have to show a photo 
identification card to receive 
their monthly benefits. This 
should prove a smart move. In 

Letters to the .Editor 

The Guardian 

Powell 

New York City alone, an 
. estimated 2 ,500 food stamp 
authorization cards are 
"stolen" each month. 

The Agriculture Depart· 
ment also intends to halt 
immediate replacement of 
authorization cards. Under the 
new plan, recipients will be 
out of luck if they lose their 
cards more than twice in a six-
mon th period. There will be no 
further replacements. 

Though the president's men 
didn 't credit their predeces· 
sors, we still raise our glasses 
to the new fraud-fighters. 

After seemingly countless 
congressional studies and 
television investigations, 
reform may be on its way. 

But the administration 
shouldn't stop now. Reagan's 
SWAT team should remove 
wholesale food distributors 
from the food stamp cycle. 
They might also tighten 
verification requirements and 
penalize states with high error 
rates. 

Moreover, the administra· 
tion could follow through on a 
proposal giving states access

to wage and benefit informa· 
tion so they assure that the 
income of food stamp 
recipients is correctly 
recorded. 

We're going to miss Ronald 
Reagan's anecdotes about food 
stamp cheaters. The stories 
never failed to arouse a crowd 
and helped define the way we 
view food stamp abusers in 
America . 

Food stamp abusers may not 
appreciate Reagan's action, 
but they must be awed that 
he's kept his word. 

The Creationism controversy continues 
Editor: 

Two weeks ago I submitted 
a letter to (The UCSD 
Guardian, Oct. 1) entitled "In 
Support of Creation Science." 
Since then, three letters have 
appeared on these pages both 
questioning and challenging 
the validity of my arguments. 
The first centered on my 
contention that evolution 
contradicts the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics. The second 
and most widespread criticism 
concerned whether creation-
ism is science or merely 
re ligious. Here I wish to 
con t inue thi s debate by 
answering the challenges set 
forth in their letters. . 

My second law discussion 
obviously confused one writer 
(Eric]. Wilner, "Comment on 
Religion, The UCSD Guar· 
dian, Oct. 8) and upset another 
(Nathaniel Wander, . "Rock of 
Ages' Author Answer s 
Critics, " The UCSD Guar· 
dian , Oct. 8). While Mr. 
Wander is entitled to his belief 
that thi s law " ... has nothingto 
say one way or another about 
evolution ," the fact is that 
scientific logic disagrees with 
him . 

It is true that a decrease of 
entropy in one system can 
occur, at the expense of 

increased entropy in another 
system. An example of this is 
the massive increase in 
complexity an animal goes 
th rough while developing from 
a mere embryo to a fully 
deve loped adult. This is 
counteracted by the increased 
disorder of the "kindly old 
su n ... sending down new 
packets of energy" (Wander's 
terminology). 

Two characteristic features, 
however , of any su ch localized 
decrease of entropy is that 
there is firs t , a mechanism of 
energy transformation and 
second , a preexisting program 
directing the series of changes 
into more complex forms . In 
the example just cited the 
energy transformation 
mechanisms are photosyn -
thesis and the many processes 
of cellular metabolism. The 
program directing the change 
is always contained within t he 
highly informationa l genetic 
DNA molecule. 

When it comes to describing 
the chemical evolution that 
supposedly preceeded the first 
life forms on earth. evolution· 
ists are totally lacking a 
mechani sm to explain how the 
sun 's energy produced this 
localized entropy reversal . The 
fact is that none exists. 

Photosynthesis, glycolysis, or 
any form of cell ular 
metabolism was yet to be 
invented by nature since there 
sti ll were no cells in existence. 

Also, what program directed 
these upward evolutionary 
trend s once cells began 
thriving? All evolutionists will 
agree that there is no 
evolutionary program con· 
tained within any cell 's DNA. 
In other words, there is no 
nucleotide seq uence which 
"tells" the cell "you and your 
progeny will begin developing 
into new and advanced forms 
of life." 

Their only explanation is 
natural selection, a process 
which begins with accidents 
(ca lled genetic mutations) and 
continued due to chance (if 
environme ntal condition 
make it favorable for the 
organism). Natural selections 
falls far hort of explaining the 
di versit y and complexity of 
even the simple t bacterial 
cell s. 

Dr. Henry Morri s, in his 
book The King of Creation 
(Creation, Life Publishers, San 
Diego, 1980) argues best the 
case against natural select ion. 
He states that even if one·half 
of all mu tations were 
beneficial, the probability of 

forming a 200 component cell 
would be one chance in 1h2OO or 
1060. Even if one considers the 
assumed earth history of.lefs 
say, 10 billion year (or 1018 
seconds) and the surface area 
of the entire earth (1014 square 
feet) with each square foot 
containing a billion organisms 
(109) mutating twice every 
second , the probability of this 
system arising by natural 
means is equal to one out of 
1()60 divided by (1014) (109)(1016) 
or 1021 • This means that the 
chance of a 2oo·component 
integrated functioning 
organism ari ing by mutation 
and natural selection just 
once, anywhere in the world, 
in all the a sumed expanse of 
geologic time, is Ie s than one 
chance out of a billion trillion! 

A 200·component organi m 
is an extremely simple y tem. 
One-celled plants and animals 
may have million of 
molecular "parts" and the 
number of mutation needed 
to evolve a bacterial cell Up to a 
human level is incomprehen-
sively enormous. 

The probability of life being 
created suddenly by natural 
means is equally impo ible. 
There . is then no adequate 
natural explanation for the 
diversity and complexity of life 

here on Earth. Since " cience" 
cannot explain origins, we are 
forced to explain them in other 
ways. Whether omeone 
wi hes to call this creative 
"force" God, Allah, Buddah , or 
something else i trictly a 
personal religiou matter. 

To the evolutionists claim 
that creation is inseparable 
from the religious notion of 
God I unashamedly plead 
guilty. But to try to paint a 
facade that evolution i 
strict ly science while creat ion 
is strictly religion is totally 
false. The fact is that both are 
equally religiou and both are 
equally scientific . The 
difference i that while 
creationist feel there i a 
Designer behind all life (a 
contention that no human ha, 
ever empirically di proven) 
the evolutionists ask that vou 
accept all of life on the faith 
that it created it elf 
(regardles of how improb· 
able). 

When evolutioni t like Mr. 
Wander are confronted with 
ideas that do not conform to 
their preconceived notion of 
what cience hould be. they 
di mi the challenges and 
claim they are not science.

Here's a goodie. I call it the 

"Cheap Shot'.' Place a ball on the 
edge of the corner pocket. Then, 
take a half-dollar and lean it 
against the side rail at the other 
end of the table. (If you don't have 
a half-dollar, you can always write 
home to your parents: they'd love 
to hear from you .) 

Tell your friends you're gonna 
sink the ball in the corner, using 
the half-dollar as a cue ball . It's not 
hard. Hit the COin solidly on the 
edge, just above the center. and it 
wilr roll along the rail knocking the 
ball in the pocket. But don't forget 

to scoff up the half-dollar. Be-
cause you're not supposed to 
lose money dOing trick 

shots -just win Lite Beers. 
TIE C_ TII(I( 

This one drives people nuts . Place 
a ball on the head spot. With the chalk, 
make a circle around it , approximately 
8" in diameter. Then put a quarter or 
half-dollar on top of the ball. (Yes, you 
can use the same one from before , or 
you can write home to your parents 
again .) Place the cue ball behind the 
foot line and have your friends try to 

by Steve Mizerak 
knock the coin out of the circle. 
Chances are , they won't be able 
to (this is a good time to work on 
your Lite Beer and act smug) . 

When you shoot, do one of two 
things : hit the object ball head-on 
with follow-through so the cue ball 
knocks the coin out, or hit the cue 
ball very, very slowly so the coin 
rolls off the object ball . 

'UU~RS 
Now for simple table etiquette. 

After you've "hustled" your 
friends , you gotta keep 'em. So do 
what I call "Clearing the Table:' 
Simply offer to buy the next round 
of lite Beer. They'll all clear the 
table fast and head for the bar (or 
to your room or apartment). Then, 
once they all have Lite (just one 
apiece- you're not too rich, re-
member), tell them with Lite in 
hand and a smirk on your face that 
your shots were no big deal- you 
were just showin' oft

AS Council may vote itself stipends 
Proposal discussed last night; may receive vote next week 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
Associate N e ws Editor 

Would student government 
be more effective if its 
members were paid? AS 
Presi dent Jules Bagn e ri s 
think it would. 

At last night's AS Council 
meeting, Bagneris introduced 
a proposal asking that 
monthly stipends be paid to all 
counci l members, 

The council approved only 
the concept of the stipends. 
Their specific amounts will be 
deliberated later this week and 
a fina lized proposal will be 
submitted for a vote at next 

Wednesday night's meeting. 
Bagneris contends that the 

·tipend proposal is very 
modest. [f instituted, stipends 
would likely con s ume ix 
percent of the AS budget he 
estimated. Thi s rate is 
considerably Ie s than what 
other student government 
officials receive at other UC 
campuses. 

Six percent of this year's 
budget amounts to $15,120, 
which would provide salaries 
the nine months covering 
September 1981 to May 1982. 

In addition to their AS 
wages, college representatives 

will be allowed to s eek 
matching fund from their 
individual colleges , which 
would amount to $675 a year 
per col lege. 

Currently no stipends are 
paid to any council member, 
nor do they receive other 
benefi ts such as parking 
privi leges. In fact he believes 
there is a "di incentive" to 
working fer the AS. 

"It's definitely a good 
experience, but that experi· 
ence does not offset the need 
for a sti pend ," said Bagneris. 

Stipends are needed to 
compensate for the time

ment. which could otherwise 
be devoted to a regular paying 
job elsewhere , he explained. 

" Quite frankly, the AS will 
never be an effective advocate 
for s tudents until the time 
normally given to an out ide 
job is able to be devoted trictly 
toward student advocacy," he 
aid. 

As it stands now, orne 
council members apparently 
put in many long hard hours of 
work, while others reportedly 
are lax and do not even attend 
regular meetings. 

"Flat hone tly , there are a 
lot of individual who have 
poor attendance records. Some 
have legitimate excuses, but 
others just don 't how up, " 
said Bagneris. 

"We've already had a couple 
members who have mi sed 
two council meet ings in the 
last three weeks," he said , 
"and they are only allowed to 
miss three meetings per 
quarter before they are put off 
the council." 

If the stipend propo al i 
approved , however, council 
members will be required to 
hold office hours and to work 
on s pecific project , he sa id. 

T o ensure t hat council 
member fulfill their duties

law was recently added to the 
proposal. It . tates that in the

can be placed on that 
member's stIpend.

T hursd ay, Octo be r 15, 1981 

UC Inust 
slash its 
budget 

As a result of Governor 
Brown's announcement today 
(Friday, October 9) that two 
percent wi ll be cut from the 
current operat ing budget of 
the Univers it y of California, 
UC is seeking ways to reduce 
its budget by about $22 
million. 

"We are already more than 
one·fourth of the way through 
this fiscal year," UC Vice 
President William B. Fretter 
pointed out, "which makes the 
reduction very difficult to 
accom modate. We will be 
consu lti ng with st udents, 
faculty and staff in the next 
few days. In addition, [ expect 
to di scuss the matter with the 
University Board of Regents at 
its regular meeting in Lo 
Angeles next Thursday, " 
Fretter said. 

"The university has already 
su. tained cuts of more than 
$30 million in its current 
budget . Tho. e cuts have hurt 
the universitv and these will 
hurt even more," he said . "I 
am well aware of the St ate's 
difficult fi<.;ca I problems, and 
the uniq'rsity wi ll do its part 
10 aVOId tng a deficit."

AS talks 
about pay 
COlli i ll lll'd II " "l pal4c ;} 
payi ng tipends, said Buck, is 
that students w ho choose to be 
in student government should 
be able to sacr ifice the time to 
do it. 

But not all students can 
afford to be in student 
government wit hout fi nancial 
com pensat ion. T h us, the 
competition for jobs is li mited 
to t hose who can afford it. 

Th is theory holds true on 
the larger political scale as 
well, according to Richard 
Winter , a visiting professor of 
Political Science from 
Dartmouth. "The experience 
in late and local governtrn'nt 
has been that pay make job 
more available to a larger 
number of people, which in 
turn leads to competition 
among more people ," said 
Winters. 

Bagneris also supports the 
stipend propo al bypointingto 
the experience of other UC 
campu'e where stipends are 
paid . 

At UCLA, officer were even 
paid a st ipend throughout the 
summer, so that they could 
work in preparation of the 
coming year. he added, 

The average monthly 
stipend for the president at 
UCLA, ucr, UCSB. UCD, and 
UCB is $315; the average 
stipend for other officers is 
$250. 

Still there is oppo ition to 
the tipend proposal within 
the AS council. Members like 
Pam Gerber fee l that the 
proposal should first be put to 
students in the form of a 
referendum or student poll, 

Roommates 
~'Olllilli ll" I ,,,I pag(' I 
three other roommates. I have 
to alol some time to do my 
share of maintaining the 
cleanliness of the apartment." 
she explai ned. 

Er ic. a Third College 
student, finds it more 
convenient to live by himself. 
He sa id t hat in order Lo avoid 
conflicts, It is best to live with 
someone with a "sense of 
equ ity," 

"r like living alone because I 
like to fix up my place my way, 
I'm a neat, organized person 
and I don ' t need to put up with 
sloppy roommates," Eric 
explained . 

When resident dean were 
asked what triggers roommate 
problem ' , they unanimou ly 
responded that conflicts ari e 
from the students' "varied 
living habits ," 

Pat Danyshy lyn-Adam , 
Muir College Resident Dean, 
said that roommates'lifestyies 
are often different. "Somebody 
may be an early morning 
person and another may be a 
late night person. ft's difficult 
to put their lifestyle s 
together," she said. 

"Nothing surpri es me with

on-campus housing con tracts_ 
By specifical l y s tating 
personal Jivi ng habits, it is 
easier to pair up ideal 
roommates. 

Mark Cunningham, Warren 
College Residence Dean, said 
t h at st udents l iving in 
residence h all s have less 
opportunities to choose their 
roommates. 

Bu t even when students live 
with someone they have 
known, roommate problems 
are not always eliminated . 

When asked about the 
existence of a group living 
code, Cunningham said that it 
cannot be enforced. But , a code 
ca n be implemented by 
residence advisors who can 
assist roommates in e tabli h-
iog "a form of agreement 
about qu iet hours ." 

"My roommate has a 
hearing impairment ," said one 
Muir student. "He says he 
can't hear hiS favorite rock 
and roll mus IC unless hiS 

~tere() Is full blast. I could 
tolenHt' the stereo n(lIse to a 
C{'rtain le\ el , but not when /'m 

sttJd~ing inten~el\' for a 
midterm." -

"One nIght, I had to cram for 
a mind-bending chemlstrv 
midterm the next day" he 
added. "I kindl y asked mv 
roommate to turn down his 
stereo which was cranked 
several decibels. Well, the 
response r got was, 'Vh, why 
don'l you go to the li brary?" '-

Most s tudent s rese n t 
roommates who bring home 
their girl friends or boyfriends 
to spend t he night in their 
room, butt hey appear hesitant 
to talk about this matter. '" 
don't want to create any 
conflict jus t because of leep-
over problem . I want my own 
space, though ," explained one 
junior. 

" My roommate sleeps with 
hi s girlfriend on weekend . I 
don't mind at all if they leep 
together somewhere alse, but 
not in my room. Her presence 
threatens my privacy, " he 
added. 

One sophomore who shares 
an apartment with two other 
friends said, "what bothers me 
is having a third roommate' 
did not even as k for ." 
According to h im, the 
apartment has become his 
roommate's girlfrie n d 's 
habitue whereas she has her 
own place to stay. 

A conflict ar ises when 
roommates want to use the 
phone at the same time. "One 
of t hese days, I will have my 
own phone instalIed ," said one 
inf uriated Muir student. "My 
roommate is too incons iderate 
w hen it comes to phone use. 
I've talked to him about our 
phone situation , but it is still 
unresolved. " 

Unlike other students who 
complain that their room· 
mates pilfer some of their food 
Anne, a sophomore, said that 
she and her roommates do not 
have food and grocery 
arguments. "All four of us 
have different food prefer-
ences, so we don't eat each 
other's foods," she added. 

When asked how to prevent 
roommate conflicts, Danyshy· 
lyo·Adams explained that it is 
important fO(' roommates to 
take some time to discuss 
complaints with each other. 
" Unless you don't let your 
roommate know what bothers 
you, there is a potential for a 

Ii' roommate problem," s said .

UCSD Guardian 
poll results 

By TOM URBACH 

The UCSD Guardian Reader 
Polls are in, and the return 
rate wa s, in a word 
underwhelming. We received 
thirty three replies out of 9.000 
papers . which calculates out to 
a return rate of just over one 
third of one percent. Actually 
this is not so bad . It is. in 
relati ve terms, cons iderably 
higher than the percentage of 
benzoate of soda in your 
average soft drink. 

While the quantity of replies 
was 'mall, their quality more 
than compensated. Many 
reader s offered frank 
criti cis ms and penet rating 
observatIOns. We offer our 
thanks to those of vou who 
took the time to -respond. 
There were. of course, a fe\\ 
pollees who were not en! Irelv 
serious in t heir comments. 
While \\ e ale saddened that 
they did not see fit to grace us 
v,:ith .their constructive input, 
we did get a good laugh. 

A return rate as low as ours 
precludes any sort of 
demolexic conclusion '. We are 
not able to distingui h void' in 
the poll response from voids in 
our readership. We would like 
to think, however, that our 

readership is a little wider 
than the poll returns suggest. 

Several people expressed a 
desire to see more coverage of 
campus activities. There was 
also a call (amid rumors of 
ballot box stuffing) for more 
sports coverage. Discoura-
gingly few people expressed an 
interest in the science section 
though it seems that ou r staff 
does not s hare my concern 
with this catastrohpe. 

Section popularity was 
varied. ews and sports were 
the most widely read sect ions. 
wit h classified ads and science 
the lea st popular. Our 
conclUSIOn is that people who 
like science(l know you an'out 
there) don't like to fill out 
reader poll,;.

We emphasize the fact that 
this poll can hardly be called 
representative, and we do not 
believe that it accurately 
reflects the Guardian 
readership. We feel, in fact , 
that it probably tells us more 
about the people who fill out 
polls than it does about the 
vast majority of our readers. 
Nonetheless, in a show of good 
faith (and in demonstration of 
our sense of humor), we have 
published the results of the 
poll. We thank those of you 
who participated for your time

Hi Th(.' (;ual'dian 

Dick Gregory speaks on nutrition, 
health, fasting and the good life 

In town after completing record 70 day fast 
BY LOTUS 

Here' to the man who ju t 
completed the longest fast in 
recorded history. This past 
week Dick Gregory, whomany 
of us know as a commedian, 
political activist, author, and 
nutritionist, came to San 
Diego to talk about his fast and 
other related current event . 

The evening began with a 
jazz ensemble that performed 
until the crowd became 
restless and start ing chanting 
for Dick Gregory. After a while 
a slender, smartly dressed, 
bright-eyed and youthful man 
walked onto the stage and 
began talking about every· 
thing from current events to 
nutrition. Gregory covered an 
amazing amount of ground in 
the two hours that he 'poke, 
constantly mixing humor with 
the most serious of topics . 

He spoke a great deal about 
the J .F,K , assassination 
conspiracy and other current 
controversies. But, when the 
political topics were pretty 
much exhausted he went on to 
some deep personal and 
spiritual experiences. 

traumatic hock put un Ihe 
body. He said that after a 
certain period of time his body 
began producing morphine 
which was relea 'ed into his 
bloodstream. He also said that 
morphine is found in those 
who overeat as well as those 
who undereat. 

This di covery how how 
the body eases its own pain by 
producing a powerful drug 
uch as morphine into the 

system when put under stress. 
A brief note on Gregory's 

background: He began his 
career a a comedian and 
somewhat radical black figure. 
At the time his diet was pretty 
conventional, consisting of 
most everything and anything 
found in a supermarket. He 
also drank and smoked a great 
deal. H is weigh t was a 
problem, and I guess like many 
people he was looking for a 
way out. 

He hooked up with an herbal 
nutritionist, and -went on a 
long fast to lose his excess 
weight. On ce see ing the 
incredible power of fasting and 
it's healing properties, he 
decided to use it as a political 
tool of protest during the 
Vietnam war. 

and vegetables. One by one he 
gave up all hi . old habit · until 
he wa ' a new man. 

Through periodic fasting 
and much study, he became a 
fruitaria n, livi ng solely on 
fruit and water . A ' an 
experiment he and Victoras 
Kovin 'ka (author of Survival 
into the 21st Century) ran three 
thousand miles across the 
United States on a liquid diet. 

Furthermore he claims that 
what the doctors say about us 
only using ten percent of our 
brain is true, because ninety 
percent of it is involved in 
maintaining the body and 
digesting food . 

Saturday afternoon he gave 
a free lec! ure on nutrition 
which really shed light on 
many questions involving 
health, The lecture was geared 
mainly to how people how 
good , natural , vegetarian food 
is the soundest way to keep a 
healthy and happy body, mind 
and spirit. 

Food ' that were given a star 
were fruits, vegetables and 
seeds, Ca e after ca e have 
been healed of ca ncer, 
arthritis, rheumatism and 
other 'ierious illnesses through 
the simple u e of herbs and 
vegetables.

Smit sparks v- ball team 

Having fun is part of the game 
BY SCOTT ALLISON 

Senior Staff Writer 
Every winning team seems 

to.have a player that it looks to 
for the big play, a player who 
brings the crowd to its feet and 
fires up the entire team with a 
sparkling dive or a rousing 
effort. 

Such a player is Tammy 
Smit, one of the premier 
players on UCSD's unbeaten 
women's volleyball team, and 
- just maybe - one of the top 
female athletes at thi school. 

Although only a sophomore, 
Smit is among the team 
leaders in everal offensive 
and defen s ive categories. 
Going into Tuesday night's 
match against Pt. Lorna, she 
was second on the team with 
97 kill ,and he led t he team 
with a solid .360 hitting 
average, 16 unassisted blocks, 
and 40 service aces. 

And she does it all with a 
smile. 

"Tammy 's a happy 
individual who loves to play 
t he game," says assistant 
coach Mike Hipp. "She's had a 
major impact on how well 
we're doing." 

Head coach Doug Dannev ik 
can't say enough about the 5'9" 
Smit. "She smiles, she's 
bouncy, and she 's happy," 
say Dannevik. "And best of 
all , her enthusiasm rubs off on 

the rest of the team, She sets a 
fine example," 

One reason why Smit looks 
as though she s enjoying 
herself out on the court is 
because she really does love to 
play. She left a four-year 
scholarship at Washington 
State last year primarily 
because volleyball there was 
more a chore than a game. 

" It was like a job there," 
reca lls Smit. " [ came to UCSD 
because they player ' here play 
because they walltto. We have 
a lot of fu n here." 

Currently Dannevik i:, 
touting mit as UCSD's next 
All-American athlete. 

"She's definitely a potential 
All-American. She's our best 
hitter, and perhap our best 
pa ser. And right now I'm 
working with her to become 

more of an all-around player," 
says Dannevik. 

Tomorrow night in the main 
gym Tammy Smit, wearing 
#7, will lead the Tritons on 
against Azusa Pacific College. 
The last time the Tritons 
played Azusa, APC was 
crushed, 15-10, 15-5, 15-1. This 
time Azusa is expected to come 
out fighting for revenge. 

But no matter how close the 
match may be, if you are one of 
those in attendance tomorrow 
night , you wi ll see that the 
Triton wit h the smile on her 
face making the big plays is #7, 
Tammy mit. he'llbetheone 
working hard - and ye, 
having fun. 

" I like playi ng just for the 
fun of it, " Smit say, "becau e 
we do our best when we're 
having fun."

Stick' ent gets stuck in 
a Chocolate City stic~y attack 

BY VALERI S. AN DERS 
Staff Writer 

Intramural men's flag 
football last weekend 'aw 
Chocolate City take on 
Stich'em in AAA action. Both 
teams have a his tory of 
winning s easo n s with 
numerous games in pos t· 
'eason play, and this year 
looks to be no except ion. Both 
teams have high powered 
offenses, and talented players 
that twist and t urn to pick up 
extra yardage, always giving 
100 percen t. 

Chocolate City , (or C.C. as 
they yell toget her in a huddle 
before the start of each half) 
drew first blood, but Stich'em 
(a med student team) came 
r ight back on their fi rst 
possess ion to even things up, 
(6·6). After another C D. T. D. 

Stich 'ems next drive was cut 
s hort by Mark Sharp's 
interception. The half ended 
12·6 in favor of Chocolate City . 

Stich'em started the second 
half with two sensational 
catches by Joel Erickson, one 
for Stich'ems second touch· 
down. The score was 12·all , 
and the momentum of the 
game appeared to have s hifted 
in Stich'ems favor. 

Bu t Chocolate City wou ld 
not be denied. They scored on 
their next po session and held 
defensively on Stich'ems next 
drive fordng them to turn the 
ball over. 

Twice C.C ran nearl y the 
length of the entire fi eld to the 
endzone, on ly to have the plays 
brought back on penalt ies. 
T he thi rd time no whistles 
were blown and Chocolate 

City held a commanding lead 
at 24·12, with relatively little 
t ime left. 

Ron Hayward gave Stich'em 
one more chance, after scoring 
to bring his team to within ,6, 
a nd when they were able to 
hold on defense it looked to be a 
close finis h . But the meds' 
hopes ended when Chris 
Wa 'hington of C.C. caught an 
interception and the team was 
able to eat ·up t he clock. 

The game ended 24·18 in 
fa vor of Chocolate City, with 
crie' of "Sweet Chocolate" 
comi ng from the winners 
cheering sect ion , and I hose of 
" 0 Doctor " coming from 
Stich'em.' fan s'.
