Despite 
Proposal, 
Boycott 
Continues 

Despite a proposal offered 
yeste rd ay by Cha n ce llor 
William McElroy th at con-
ceded some of their dem ands, 
org anize r of thi s week' 
vending machine ay they will 
extend the boycott until next 
Friday . 

The AS .spon ored Vending 
Machine Task Force, which is 
organizing the boycott , has not 
offi c i a ll y r e sponded to 
McElroy's proposals a nd will 
not do so until early next week, 
according to T ask Force 
spokesmen. 

The AS wants to " keepup the 
pressure" on McElroy by 
continuing the boy c ott , 
according to Task Force leader 
Nancy Laga , who also said that 
she didn't think the task force 
would agree to McElroy 's 
proposals. 

McElroy's offer includes 
increasing the funding 
available to UCSD's four 
colleges from vending machine 
revenues and giving the 
Student Center Board the 
a pproximately $4500 in 
revenues from the student 
center veodiaC madUnes. 

The funding to colleges ~ 
though, is still less than last 
ye ar's allocations. This 
summer McElroy announced 
his intention to' transfer 
vending machine revenues , 
traditionally used for student 
activities, from the colleges to 
Housing and Food Services in 
order to make up a debt there. 

~ ·It ' s just not enough," said 
La ga a bout McElroy's 
proposals.

Senator Joseph Biden spok~ before a crowd 
Plaza Wednesday, __ .... St. ....... 

Delaware Senator 

Blden erl.'eIZft .. 
US Leadership 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Associate Managing Editor 
Looking and sounding very 

much like the east coast's 
answer to Jerry Brown. US 
Senator Joseph Biden, 
D-Delaware spent part of his 
day on campus Wednesday. 

Biden, at 36 one of the 
youngest members of the 
Senate, mixed criticism of 
current office holders with his 
hope that American leaders 
show more "style" in the way 
they lead the nation. 

"America 's new Senators 
remind me of middle 
management men at J.C. 
Penny's or dentists; they're 
good J,echnicians and llice 
people, but you don' t want to 
go to them," Biden said. . 

Criticizing President Carter 
in particular for a lack of 
leadership - "though he is 
maki .... g the right policy 
decisions' - he told a 
lunchtime crowd of about SOO 
on Revelle Plaza that the 
" American political leader-
ship has been presenting the 
American public with 
Hobbsian choices , false 
choices." 

American involvement in 
the Vietnam War. which he 
said first led him into politics 
at the University of Delaware 
and Syracuse University, is 
one of the best examples of a 
Hobbsian choice he said, one 
in which none of the 
alternative s presented 
provide any hope of a solution 
that will satisfy most people. 

Blden, who ay!! he will not 
run for President in 1980 
(though he jokes about not 
ruling out 19114) , a lso repeated 
the Brown-like message that 

there are no easy solutions to 
the nation's problems. 

"The SALT talks a re not a 
panacea or a disaster," Biden 
said. " We' re number one 
militarily, absolutely , but. 
sure, the Soviet Union is 
taking advantage in some 
ways of the talks. It's hard to 
say which side is right. " 

Biden also told his audience 
that " the possibility of being 
able to do anything about 
(unequal income distribution) 
is about zero." adding that he 
thought that reforming the tax 
structure should be one of the 
nation's top priorities. 

Biden resembled Brown in 
at least one other way . He told 
an appreciative questioner 
that "we have been short-
sightedd in saying space 
programs are an expendable 
item ... the resources and 
knowledge we can gain from 
space is tremendous ."

Biden addressed a group of 

students from Political

on Revelle Plaza , telling them 
of his background in politics. 

Saying he was pushed by the 
war to get into politics, he told 
the budding politicos , " I 
became more outraged with 
both parties a t their foreign 
policy, but when it came time 
to run ror oHlce, I chose the

Ball,ot Questions 
Pass AS Council 
Violations Charges Rejected 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
and Reed Alpert 

The AS Council voted Wednesday night to include three 
referendum ques tions on its April 25-26 ballot and narrowly voted 
against a controversial fourth question, while earlier that evening 
the AS Election Commission voted to dismiss three campaign , 
violation charges filed in the first two days of the campaigning. 

The three referendum questions to appear on the ballot are 1) 
Should the Coffee Hut be converted to a faculty club or be 
designated for student use ? 2) Should the Regents be elected or 
appointed to their posts? 3) Should a semester or quarter system 
be used in the UC system? 

A fourth question that was narrowly defeated concerned the 
question of when new AS officials should take office. Presentl.y, the 
newly elected AS officials take office six days after the electIOn. A 
bill before the Council Wednesday night proposed to put to the 
students in the referendum the idea of making the delay 13 days. 

"This would allow an extra week for new members to prepare," 
said Nancy Laga, AS Revelle rep and vice presidential candidate. 
She added that it would ease the effects of transition between the 
old and new government and allow the new members to learn their 
duties from the outgoing officials without putting the new 
government behind in its duties. 

Barry Hyman, student welfare commissioner and presidential 
candidate, opposed the bill because he said it would extend the 
tenure of the lame duck government and move the new 
government's work load back· one week, thereby pushing the 
budget and other processes back and possibly into fall quarter. 
Hyman stalled the vote on the bill by leaving the meeting and 
breakiDf quorum three t1rnes befoft he remained to the room for 
the vote. the bfll was defeated 7-5~1 . falUn, the heeded 2/ 3 
majority. 

Hyman explained his breaking quorum, an actioll f()rbidden by 
the Council bylaws. as "civil disobedience" and an attempt to 
increase the discussion time on the bill . Hyman felt the issue had 
not been researched sufficiently. 

CampaIgn Violations 
The Elections Commission ruled that two charges filed against 

Common Sense slate candidates and one against the Question 
Authority slate were not valid. 

The charge against Question Authority, that the members of the 
sl~te had worn buttons supporting their slate before campaigning 
was allowed under the election codes, was dismissed because. a 
commission spokesman said. " It's impossible to tell when they

Reg Fee Backs 
New UEO Position 

University Events Office received a requested ",127 budget 
increase from the R~gistration Fee Committee yesterday to pay a 
full-time clerk. despite a counterproposal from the Committee's 
student members to substitute the money for additional 
programming of actual events. 

"The new help should release the professional staff to give 
attention toward better programming," Annala said. 

The additional funds were provided on a temporary basis. with 
the understanding that an Investigation into all of the 
programming on campus will be made. 

Several of the members of the committee said if the 
investigation was made without living the requested support to 
the office. it would guarantee a negative outcome. Only two 
members voted against the UEO budget increase. 

Annala said the new clerical money Is needed to handle the 
workload created by the master calendar. which coordinates 
programming campuswide. and to allow staff members to spend 
more time advising student organizations in order to help their 
events succeed. 

The committee turned down an additional UEO request for 
"".5711 intended to make two 10111 month positions year-round. but 
Annala will have the option to spend the new clericaJ money for 
this purpose by hiring the clerk at lesa than a full time level. 

The committee also approved an additioaal ..... 0. for the 
Daycare Center. necessitated by the federal government's CETA 
program cutting back fundin; on two staff positions next year. 

The Reg Fee Committee. which is composed of seven tudents 
and five administrators. doe not have final authority to anocate 
funds, but makes recomm~dations to Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage. The committee has con idered each 
section of the budget, and mu t now consider the entire budget to 
ensure that it matches income.

Because of small amounts of

War on Smoking 
Burns Out Early 

Califano Outgunned by Tobacco 
Lobby's Money, Connections 

By Richard Mahler 
Pacific News Service 

T he publication re(!ently of yet another Surgeon General's report, repeating the fact that smoking is 
hazardous to health , raises the question: what ever 

happened to Joseph Califano Jr.'s much·heralded war on the 
cigarette habit? 

More than one year ago, on Jan. 11 , 1978, the Secreta ry of 
Health , Education and Welfare announced what sounded like 
the most ambitious effort yet to get 54 million Americans to quit 
what he ca lled "slow motion suicide." Now it seems the battle 
was doomed from the start. 

Califano outlined a four·pronged $30 million attack to be 
directed from a new Office on Smoking and Health. He 
proposed a joint HEW-Treasury Department task force to 
consider a cigarette tax increase and a new tax based on tar and 
nicotine content. 

Richard Mahler is a free-lance who writes from Santa Monica, 
Ca. 

He called for a $6 million education campaign, directed at 
youth and those especially vulnerable to smoking hazards. He 
said he was asking the Federal Trade Commission to bolster 
warnings against smoking, the Civil Aeronautics Board to 
consider banning all airplane smoking, and insurance 
companies to consider non-smoker discounts, 

By last fall , however, a Treasury Department spokesman for 
the tax review group told an interviewer that "the task force at 
the moment is sleeping - not dead, but sleeping," 

The FTC went along with Califano's request for stronger 
warnings on cigarette packs, but Congress declined to approve 
them. 

The C~B agreed to snuff out pipes and cigars on commercial 
ai rlines, butCew expect the agency to ban smoking on airplanes 
entirely. 

The Food and Drug Administration rejected a request that it 
regulate nicotine as a drug, wbile tobacco lobbyists managed to 
exempt their products from the 197. Toxic Substances Act. 

B ut the underlying problem has been money. The anti-smoking campaign's skeptics conteDded that $30 
million (trimmed later to S26 mlllion) Is laughable in 

the face of the tobacco industry's own $SOC) million annual 
advertising budget. 

"Califano wanted only $30 million for what he termed 'the 
nation's primary preventable cause of death,' " a Washinllon 
pundit lamented, "when $250 million was made available for a 
non-existent disease like swine nu." 

Many critics think that Califano, a three-pack-a-day man·for 
2. years until he quit in 1'75, must have known his attack could 
not get far in the face of the enormous power wielded by the 
tobacco industry. In 1977, the industry claims to have paid 16 
billion in taxes while conducting an estimated $7 billion worth of 
business. Its lobby, according to Sen, Edward Kennedy, 
chairman of the subcommittee on Health, is "probably the most 
effective on Capitol Hill." • 

More than 8 month before Califano announced his war on 
smoking, Kentucky's Democratic Senator Walter- D, 
Huddleston received Carter's perlonal promise that the 
Department of Agriculture's MOO million-a-year tobacco price 
stabilization subsidies would continue, 

The President, native son of a tobacco producing state, has 
long-standing ties to the cigarette industry. He sometimes 
vacations, for example, at the estate of Smith Bagley, heir to 
the R.J. Reynolds fortune. And inside the office of Frank 
Saunders, director of corporate relations for Phillip Morris and 
the only big-business man to work fulltime on the Carter 
campaign, is a photograph of the President's SWearing-in 
inscribed; . 'Your help on my campaign made this day possible 
(signed) Jimmy Carter." ' 

D uring a visit to tobacco-rich North Carolina last March th~ President emp~a~ized in Winston-Salem that twO: 
thlnis of the $30 million pledged against smOking for 

1979 would be spent on research, 
"Nobody need fear the facts about tobacco use," Carter said, 

"Certainly no one need fear the emphasis on research that will 
make the use of tobacco in the future even more safetban it has 
been in the past." 

Recently asked to describe White House reaction to his anti-
smo~ing attack, Califano replied : "The President said 'you're 
on the right track'." ' 

At the .Offlce of Smoking and Health - which has a budget of 
$2.5 million, not the $6 million Califano wanted - director John 
Pinney reports a "steady stream" of non-threatening non-
accusatory educational materials are nowing to schoois and 
others. 

P rivately. though, tobacco industry lobbyists confess they 're less worried about such small government 
efforts than they are about changes in regulations or 

price-supports. (Please turn to page )4)

Surprise: Drugs, Sex the Greatest 
One afternoon, while sitting in 

Cluster Library trying to write a five 
page paper for American History, I 
started to think about my freshman 
year at Wes U., and how I spent most of 
it running around like a chicken 
without a head. I must have had a few 
screws loose upstairs .... 

I ' ll never be able to erase the 
memories of my first few days at old 
Wes. I had a rousing send-off. Mom, 

' Debbie Birman is a junior transfer 
student from Weselyan University and a 
native of New Rochelle, New York. 
Dad and my younger brother drove 
me up to school. It was a tense ride. To 
calm everyone's nerves . Mom 
suggested that we stop on the way at 
McDonald's . After ordering, I politely 
excused myself and threw up in the 
washroom. Mom tried to comfort me 
between bites of hamburger. " Be 
good," she admonished. " Don't make 
a big mess in your room. Study hard. 
Watch your diet. Keep your radio 
down . And , by all means, if you should 
happen to meet any nice boys, don'tdo 
anything. Call me firsC.'We finally left. 

My room was on the second floor of 

the dorm. By the time I got up there 
everyone had taken off for a local bar. 
The Resident Advisor was standing in 
the middle of. a pile of boxes , 
impatiently tapping her foot. 

" Hi, I'm Betty. " She extended her 
arm breathlessly , and we shook 
hands . " I'm your new R.A. I'm a 
senior government major, and I'll be 
living in this room, If you have any 
problems , knock on my door. I'm 
usually in between the hours of five 
and five fifteen , Wednesday 
afternoons, Otherwise by appoint-

· ment. Any questions?" 
I quickly shook my head. She was 

still tapping her foot , and this was 
making me extremely nervous. _ 

With a big gulp of air Betty 
continued, " Now, if you'll excuse me, I 
think I'm going to join the gang at the 
bar. You're the last one here. Help 
yourself to a beer in the fridge. Bye." 
She disappeared. 

I was left standing completely alone 
in the hall. My head was pounding and 
my hands were sticky with sweat. All I 
could think about was that beer in the 
fridge because I had never had a beer 
in my life and for some reason I 

started wishing that I were back home 
again. 

Later that evenihg, after dinner, my 
RA threw a welcoming party in her 
room. I wandered in, immediately 
feeling a tension headache coming on. 
Most of my hall mates were huddled in 
a corner, munching popcorn and 
drinking beer. Someone lit up a joint 
and passed it around. Mom would just 
love this, I thought to myself. It was 
getting pretty hot. 

Suddenly the conversation got 
serious and my RA , looking 
deceptively straightlaced in a 
housedress , started to warn us about 
some of the pitfalls which she had 
encountered in college life. 

" Drugs , sex , alcohol and sugar are 
the greatest things in life, " ' she said, 
grinning the whole while. Nobody 
responded. 

She continued, passing out 
pamphlets on contraception. 

" I'll hang one of these in the toilet, in 
case any oC you are shy." This time she 
giggled. A picture of her boyfriend 
loomed high above the bed. 

There was a moment of total silence. 
You could hear everyone breathing.

We all eyed each other suspiciously. 
Sex? Sugar?? What in the world was I 
getting myself into in the dorms, 
anyway . I had never. Deen drunk in my 
life, and thAAk God the bathrooms 
weren't coed (or so I t:flought), As an 
instinctive reaction, I rushed into the 
bathroom, knocking the bowl of 
M&M's all over the floor on the way 
out. A loud whisper spread throughout 
the room .... 

I didn't have time to stop and worry 
about classes. Social life the lirst few 
days at school was a real whirl . When 
Chi Psi " The Lodge" fraternity hosted 
their annual meet:the-Creshmen beer 
blow-out, attendance, my RA told us, 
was mandatory, I decided to tag along 
with my wild and crazy hall. 

We went to the party. It was very, 
very crowded. I stumbled on some 
empty glass bottles lying on the front 
walk on the way in , It seemed Uke most 
of the freshman class , plus some 
identifiable upperclassmen, in leather 
jackets, was crammed into a room 
about the size of our hall bathroom. 
Everyone was spilling beer on each 
other and trying to smile.

INTERNATIONAL 
Botha Charges US With Spying By· Plane 

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - Prime 
Minister Pieter W. Botha charged Thursday 
that some US Embassy personnel have snooped 
on sensitive areas of South Africa with a 
specially equipped "spy plane, " and he ordered 
them to leave the country within a week. 

The embassy said it would have no comment,

'Blind Men' Acted at Three Mile 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In the midst of the 

cr.isis at the Three Mile Island nuclear power 
plant, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission compared himself and the 
governor of Pennsylvania to "a couple oC blind 
men staggering around making de~isions. " 

NRC Chairman Joseph M. Hendrie, in a 
prolonged meeting of the NRC two days after the 
Pennsylvania reactor broke down threatening 
large releases of radioactivity, complained 

repeatedly of inadequate inCormation about the 
accident and its then·uncertain consequence . 

"I don't have the impression that they have a 
good grip on it," said Hendrie. " We are 
operating totally in the blind. " 

Then , reCerring to Pennsylvania Gov. Dick 
Thornburgh, Hendrie added : "His information 
is ambiguous, Mine is non-existant , and - I 
don't know -' it's fike a couple fo blind men 
staggering around making decisions. "

long section damaged by the twister Tuesday 
night recovered the body oC the 43rd victim 

Thursday. The dead man was identified as 
Arden J . Turner, 33, oC Wichita Falls . 

"Maybe I'm speaking from a standpoint of 
fear rather than knowledge, but we ' re going to

said Mayor Kenneth Hill . 

Storms also struck in nearby communities 
Tuesday night, claiming the lives of another 15 
people.

groups reported yesterday they have filed a 
motion with' the Nuclear Regulatory Comission 
opposing issuance oC fin operating liscence for 
the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant until questions 
about the plant's safety are resolved. 

The special request, filed by the Center for the

'I Flat Out Will 
Not Run, in 1980' 

Sen. Biden Talks With Guardian 
Joseph Biden began as the most 

apartisan of men, a , registered 
"decline 'to state party affiliation" 
Delaware voter. When he was 
asked to run for office, he at first 
refused, saying he was comfortable 
in a law practice that "was just 
beginning to be lucrative." 

Even then, he says he ran only 
because the council to which he 
was elected met across the street 
from his law office. 

From that non · partisan 
background, Biden has become a 
two term Democratic senator from 
Delaware, filling a position that at 
one time was known as the senate 
seat from DuPont. He has been 
mentioned as a 1984 presidential 
candidate ("[flat out will not run in 
1980"), and helped work on the 
Corter primary and general election 
campaign in 1976. 

He currently serves on the 
Senate foreign relations committee, 
as well as committees that have 
jurisdiction ouer the CIA and Drug 
Enforcement Administration. 

What follows are excerpts from 
an exclusive Guardia .. interview 
with Biden and his remarks during

Political Science and student

Wednesday morning.

CIA Competency 
The CIA is competent, but its competence relates to and 

depends upon how involved it is with the host government. We, 
strangely enough, have intelligence that is more reliable on the 
hostile nations than we have with countries that we have a solid 
relationship and/or client-state relationship" .let's take Iran. 
Why is it that the Israelis read this situation and predicted what 
was happening and US intelligence did not? The reason for this is 
because we tend to be less incisive and searching and accept 
more at face value the assertions made by intelligence agencies 
of countries which we have promoted and/or put into place the 
agency. If I make you my head of secret police in a foreign 
country. my tendency is to ask you what's going on rather than to 
question, both in terms of double checking and in terms of beil)g 
generally skeptical. The information base from which the CIA 
made most of its judgments was the Iranian secret police, We 
were in bed with SAVAK for a long time, If you look at where the 
most glaring failures have occurred, that's where they've 
occurred. They have not occurred, for example, with regard to 
the Soviet Union and (Eastern Europe) . 

Jerry Brown 
Your Governor is one of the most imaginitive politicians in 

America, and I think fundamentally correct on most of his 
positions .. .in terms of where Jerry and I come from, we both 
essentially have the same style of politics. But what's Jerry 
doing? He's not exercising the positive leadership which he's 
capable, in my opinion, of doing. He 's appealing to negative 
instincts. He 's not going out and talking about hoping, dreaming 
and believing and caring again and commitm~nt and the way we 
can balance things. He's presenting us with more Hobbesian 
choices, for instance this garbage about a constitutional 
convention .. .it just makes no sense, I can't believe he beli~ves 
it. .. Jerry Brown is getting himself in real trouble, One thing is the 
switch on Proposition 13. It's one thing to make the point, but you 
really get yourself in trouble when the press begins to reinforce, 
on a daily basis, the Image of being a chameleon or opportunistic 
or whatever ... those Images go to the heart of your ability to be 
able to put through your- programs, 
Jerry brought (those problems) on. 

Drug Laws 
(Drug laws) are too strict in some 8Mas and too lenient in 

others, With regard to marijuana, I support decrlmlnallzation. 
Conversely, with relard to the penalties that exist with regard to 
control of dangerous substances. like heroin, cocaine, speed, and 
the penalities attached to the major traffic in there, I think they 
are too lenient. I support Oat time sentenciDl and minimum 
mandatory sentences for drug ofCenders. 

Why Drug Laws Are Needed 
Many d~s are very, very daDlerous. The number of O.D. 's 

from heroan and other dl'l1ls Is siplficant. The societal impact of 
drllls is vast In terms of crl me related problems. You could try to 
argue that if it was all legalized there would be no criminal 
element, and we'd eliminate the problem. But the fact of the 
matter Is even if it were legalized, even If costs were halved, it is 
stili an ~xpensive proposition for sipiCIcant numbers of the drug 
population and could lead to maintenance of their habits by 
Illegal means.

Japanese Housing Agreement Delayed 
By Heatherbell Fong 

Negotiations between UCSD 
and a Japanese student-
sponsoring organization over 
proposed additional housing on 
campus are temporarily at a 
standstill, according to Larry 
Barrett, director of auxiliary 
enterprises. 

Interlang, a corporation that 
provides opport.unities for 
Japanese students to study 
English, offered in January to 
build apartments here 
similar to those under 
construction near Third 
College . In return , the 
university would provide free 
space for Interlang students 

Standstill Due to 'M iSinterpreted' Proposal 
throughout the residence halls 
on campus for nine to ten years. 

Barrett recently said of the 
proposal, "We were hoping it 
would have been taken 
care of by January 
or February." But a "misin-
terpretation" of the proposal on 
the part of Interlang has caused 
a delay, according toBarrett . A 
letter " clarifying this 
misinterpretation" was sent by 
Assistant Vice Chancellor 
David Ernst to Interlang in 
February; Barrett said. but 

Interlang has not yet 
responded. 

Ernst explained that under 
the initial proposition, the $2 
million furnished by Interlang 
for building the housing would 
be considered "prepaid rent in 
the form of dormitory space for 
108 Interlang students." 

However, he added, "Inter-
lang assumed that the rates 
would stay at the 1978-79 level," 
in which case they would get 
fifteen years of free housing for 
their sponsored students. But 

according to projected rent 
raises, "nine to ten years" 
would fulfill the obligations of 
UCSD to Interlang, Ernst 
remarked. 

"We have made our last offer 
to them (I nterlang) , " Ernst 
continued, "but it seems to us 
that they'have put iton the back 
burner." Ernst said that he had 
heard "second hand" (rom an 
Interlang agent in the US that 
Interlang was "not in a position 
to want to commit funds" for 
the housing project. 

, 

Approximately 30 Interlang 
students are enrolled at UCSD 
and are living off campus at La 
Jolla Village Apartments, 
according to Ernst and Barrett. 
Barrett added that "this is not 
in the best interests of the 
program." 

To gain optimal exposure to 
the English language, he said, 
Interlang students should live 
with English-speaking stu-
dents. Housing them all in the 
same complex "defeats the 
purpose of the program," 
Barrett commented. 

Ernst said he "does not know 
if Interlang students will come 
here in the same numbers if the 
deal doesn't work out." 

Undocumented Workers Defended 
By Steve Schneider 

Staff Writer 
Jose Jaques Medina, 

president of the International 
Brotherhood of General 
Workers (Lo Angeles chap-
ter) , criticized the " gov.tm-
ment generated ideology" on 
how undocumented workers 
are viewed in this country in i.I 
FOl'um on Undocumented 
Workers here Tuesday night. 

Medj.na , one of four speakers 
at the well-attended forum , 
discussed the "distortion" of 
facts regarding IIndocumented 
workers, accusing the news 
media of "gearing the news to 
fit the racist ' attitudes of its 
advertisers and readers." 

Medina asserted that 
. President Carter's immigra-
tion policy is designed to 
maximize profit for businesse 
while keeping the workers " in 
the most exploitative state 
possible." 

.In addition to Medina ' s 
speech , talks were given by LQu 
Negrete , professor at Cal State 
Los Angeles : Francisco 
Algendre , member of the 
International Longshoremen's 

-and Warehouseman's Union 
and Tim Barker-. an attorney 
with the Legal Aid Society of 
San Diego. 

Barker, who is involved in 
several cases dealing with the 

constitutional rights of 
undocumented persons , 
cr'iticized the "blatantly racist 
attitudes of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. He 
accused the INS of using 
.. (legally) questionable 
procedures," stating that often 

these procedures involve 
"sheer brutality." 

Negrete, who spoke on the 
organization of undocumented 
workers in the United States, 
expressed a desire to "erase 
the past and start all over with 

regards to immigration 
policy. " 

The forum was sponsored by 
the UCSD chapter of the 
Alliance against Racism and 
Political Oppression, the 
campus-based newspaper Voz 
Fronteriza and MEChA . 

Anti-Nuke Rhetoric Labeled Dangerous 
(Continued from page 2) 

One of the great ironies in the 
anti-nuke rhetoric is that we 
ought to oppose nuclear power 
for the sake of future 
generations. It is thought that 
someday our great-
grandchildren will be beholden 
to us for eliminating the 

nuclear option when we had the 
chance in the late 1970s. What 
will a non-nuclear world 
portend for our descendents? 

Our reliance on undepend-
able and increasingly ex-
pensive energy sources can 
only grow. To the future 
generatio,ns we will beJeaving a 

legacy oC abandoning proven 
technology in favor of our 
primordial fears. As man's 
reach extends ever farther, 
there wiU alway. be those who, 
out of ignorance and Cor 
political reasons, want to limit 
that reach.

with a large distance on Swords

In practice for the upcoming 
Western Intercollegiate 
Championships the UCSD 
cycling team warmed up by 
sweeping the UC Santa 
Barbara Criterium last 
weekend with impressive 
performances by Kurt Sato. 
Steve Smull and Susan 
VanGundy . 

Men's Novice 
Forty riders entered the 

men's novice race, a grueling 
26 mile , 20 lap test of strength 
which includes three sprints 
within the race for earning 
points. Aggressive riding 
marked the event as the 
cyclists attempted to break 
away from the pack in groups of 
two or three in an effort to score 
points. 

Bob Childs of Stanford, Bra d 
Cobb of UCSD and Jeff Borders 
of UCSD initiated some of the 
early action but it was Sato who 
led the way to victory, placing 
second in the second sprint 
portion of the race and first in 
the th ird sprint . UCSD 

strongmen Eric Zentner, Allen 
Vanter and Borders planned 
their races strategically, 
chasing i:lown breaka way 
riders while Sato " sat in" 
preserving energy for the 
sprints. This teamwork allowed 
the Tritons to score three 
cyclists in the top ten positions. 

Women's Race 
The women's race was a 

contest between five break-
away riders including UCSD's 
Susan VanGundy . An average 
pace was maintained through-
out the race as the- riders 
unaggressively jockeyed back 
and forth . saving strength for 
the sprints. 

Kathy Swords of UCSB won 
the first two sprints with 
VanGundy, Lynn Kingsland of 
UCSB and Kim Williams of 
Citrus College picking up 
points. ' 

Swords appeared to have lost 
some of her snap as VanGundy 
came alive to win the last sprint 
with four laps to go. Swords

S'anta Barbara 's riders 
appeared to be stronger and to 
have the most control over the 
race. Rory O'Reilly was 
UCSB's strongest rider , vying 
for position against UCSD's 
Smull. Smull bested O'Reilly in 
the first two sprints, but Santa 
Barbara managed to come 
alive to sweep the last sprint, 
taking all nine points, virtually 
securing the race. 

.The final sprint showed Mesa 
College's Russell Weber 
winning, with O'Reilly second 
and Smull third. Final results

V-ball M~en Lose, 2-3 
Need Sweep of Last 3' Rugby Coach leaves Returns to New Zealand; Team Still Strong 

By Jon Goetz 
Senior SLaff Wriler 

The men's volleyball team 
missed a chance to prove 
its west coast superiority, 
losing to Cal Slate North'-
ridge last Friday. 

The team jumped ahead of 
highly ranked Northridge 
lWO games to none, 15-13 and 
16-14. The final win eluded 
lhe Tritons, though. They 
handed CSUN the next three 
games along with the contest 
victory. 

Coach Doug Da nn evik 
a nalyzed the breakdown as a 
passing problem . " Those 
first two games we made no 
mistakes that allowed them 
to get an easy point," he 
said . "They had to work for 
everything they got." 

" In the next three games 
we weren' t getting aggres-
siveness in our passing. We 
weren't getting the sets we 
needed. Then Northridge 
started blocking everything 
we hit." 

The late collapse by UCSD 
also had psychological roots . 

"Our team is rea lly young." 
said Dannevik. "The guys 
didn 't think they could beat 
Northridge. " 

" Those first games they 
did play well - but not so 
super that they played over 
their heads. But we let the 
momentum change too 
easily. We just couldn ' t grab 

- the momentum back." 
The loss didn 't dim the 

Tritons' shot at the NAIA 
national tonrnament how-
ever. They need to win their 
final three games, starting 
tonight at UC Riverside. The 
last time league cellar 
dweller UCR visited San 
Diego UCSD convincingly 
beat them, three games to 
one . Dannevik expects 
another win tonight , which 
will give the Tritons a second 
place finish in league. 

The next two games , 
against USIU and Cal 
Lu theran , will be the testCor 
the Tritons. Beating these 
opponents requires a 
concerted effort by the key 
UCSD players. 

By Pam Gold 
Dave Phillipson, most recent 

coach of the men ' s and 
women's rugby teams, 
returned recently to hiS native 
country of New Zealand , 
leaving the Tritons in charge of 
themselves . Despite his 
absence, the teams have been 
faring well in competition. 

Last Sunday the women 
destroyed the Eleanors of 
Pasadena , 16-0, displaying the 
uncompromising teamwork 
characteristic of the women's 
play. 

In rugby fifteen players on 
the team (eight forwards and 
seven backs) line up in rows of 
three and move towards each 
other in an effort to gain 
possession of the ball. The ball 
reaches the hooker (center 
player in the front row) who 
heels it back to start an 
offensive maneuver. 

Due to the combative nature 
of the game, casualties during 
Sunday 's match were frequent. 
According to Brown, "numer-
ous injuries were incurred 
because of lengthy pauses in 
between contests."

The women scored four 
touchdowns or " trys." Each try 
is worth 4 points , earned by 
carrying the ball over the 
opposition ' s goal line . 
However, unlike football, the 
ball must be touched on the 
ground . UCSD trys were scored 
by Connie Parker, Beth Karns, 
Ruth McCarty and Brown, 
resulting in the 16 point rout. 

The UCSD women are having 
a successful season, including a 
third place finish at the 
Stanislaus Invitational 
Tournament, beating San Jose 
State and the Aggies of UC 
Davis. 

Men's Rugby 
In the men's action that 

followed , UCSD fell to the Del 
Mar Rugby Club 7-26, in an 
unofficial game, playing three 
30 minute periods Instead of the 
usual two 40 minute bouts. This 
game served as a warm up for 
upcol'11ing competition at UC 
Santa Barbara. . 

The serum played very well 
against the much larger and 
experienced Del Mar club. 
Most notable was the serum's 

running as a pack with the ball 
and winning the ball in loose 
rucks and mauls, situations in 
which the ball is on the ground 
or being carried. 

Jaque Krih's play at serum-
half, the back who stays near 
the serum and receives the ball 
like a split-T quarterback, 
provided for the ball's smooth 
transfer from the serum to the 
backs. 

During the first half UCSD 
scored a field goal on a penalty 
kick by Jones, for three points. 
In second balf play, a try by 
Guy Woodman following a 
superb driving effort by the 
serum added to the seven point 
total. 

Del Mar utilized its Ial'ler 
size in the scrum for a number 
of ill scores. Poor tackling in 
crucial situations plagued the 
men's team. 

The men and women are 
preparing for the upcoming 
event in Santa Barbara. The 
tournament is a two-day 
extravaganza and lheclimax of 
the rugby season.

By Philip Sorensen Bryan Eck of Grand Canyon 
was credited with the victory 
by forfeit in that match. 

With number one seed Paul 
Metsch back in action, and with 
the singles teams completely 
dominating play, the UCSD 
men's tennis team stroked their 
way to a decisive 6-3 win over 
Grand Canyon College 
Wednesday afternoon at UCSD. 

Hein's injury was only one of 
many the Tritons' top players 
have been plagued with lately, 
as Metsch was still nursing a . 
muscle pull in Wednesday's 
match. Return.ing to action 
after missing two matches, 
Metsch combined a strong 
volley shot with excellent ball 
placement to take a two set 
singles victory, 6-3, 6-2. He later 
teamed with Allen Alpar to win 
in doubles over Eck and 

The Triton team took five of 
six singles matches, and 
probably would have taken all 
six had number two seed Bill 
Hein not been forced to pull out 
of his match because of a pulled 
muscle in his right shoulder.

Music /Lynette Tom 

Music Brings Town And Gown Together 
This is the last in a three part 

series on the Music Department 
and musical expression at UCSD. 

The La Joll a Universityl 
-Civic Symphony a nd Choru is 
a unique component of the 
Music 95 program . Not only is 
the organization the olde t of 
the ten group (this ye,u' marks 
its 25th anniver aJ'Y) , but it also 
has members ha iling from both 
UCS D a nd the San Di ego 
co mmunity. 

" The group is one of the few 
things where the universitya nd 
the townspeople can get 
together ," declared symphony 
conductor Thomas Nee. " It' s 
an interesting, coo pera tive 
opportunity for both groups." 

" Individuals who are serious 
at music" is ee's description 
of the 85 musicians which 
constitute his La J o ll a 

niversity /Civic Symphony. 
Every Monday from '7: 00 to 
10: 00 pm and Thursday from 
3: 30 to 5: 00 pm , they 
congregate at B-202 to learn 
and perform c lassica l and 
sy mphonic co mposition from 
the 18th . 19th , and 20th 
Centuri es. Musical experience 
is needed and the group's 
auditions are open to the public. 
In addition. th el'e is no limit to 
membership in the symphony, 
as exe mplified by Ne 's 
co mment of " it's from the 
cra dle to the grave ." 

As the symphony is <.Ilso a 
rep,'esentuti ve of San Diego, 

The La Jolla rsily/Civic Symphony orus is "unique" in 
from both UCSD and the San Diego community, 

the group sponsors severa l 
comm unity-oriented event . 
One of them is the Youth Talent 
Co ntest. Now into its 19th vea r , 
the auditions were held on 
Februa ry 10 and I I. High school 
seniors and college students up 
to 25 yea l's of age floc ked to 
UCSD 's Mandeville Rec ital 
H<.J11 in the hopes of being 
se lected as th e fir L eco nd, or 
third placewinnersinoneofthe 
four followin g categories: 
c ompo s ition , orche tra l 
instruments , piano. or voice. 
Cash awards of 100. 50 a nd 25 

are given to the respective 
winners. In addition, the fir t 
and second place winners 
perform with the symphony in a 
concert on June 2 at 8 : 00 pm. 

Another project is the 
ymphony's frequent trips to 

Tijuana . The group has played 
before capaCity au diences at 
the Jai-alai palace, the 
Fronton, and the University of 
Baja Ca lifornia with what Nee 
ca lls " a mixed bag of Spanish 
a nd Latin marches and popular 
music." 

For the past ten years , the 

ymphony has been actively 
involved in raiSing money for 
its concert ex pe nses and 
operation of both instrumental 
and choral groups. A major 
co ntribution in thi aspect 
comes from Artz-a-poppin, in 
which San Diego artisans 
gather at such location as the 
Salk Institute courtyard and 
Mandeville Center to sell their 
craft while the symphony 
entertains the buyers with 
music. There is an admission 
fee which the ymp hony 
re ce ives , as we ll as a 

percentage of the profits made. 
Residences of prominent La 

Jollans are the sites of the 
symphony's home music tour. 
Refreshments a nd an afternoon 
of music by a small chorus or 
chamber ensemble await those 
who, according to Nee, "like to 
see the homes of the we althy ." 

The La Jolla University/ 
Civic Symphony has a total of 
four to five solo or combined 
concerts each year, all of which 
are performed at the Mande-
ville Auditorium. They are 
scheduled for the weekends: 
Saturday~ at 8: 00 pm and 
Sundays at 3: 00 pm. Tickets are 
four dollars for adults and two 
dollars for students and season 
memberships are available, 
The June 2 concert will be free 
to the public. Every other year, 
the group presents a theatrical 
production. This year's effort is 
Rave l's L'Enfanl Et Les 
Sortileges. It can be seen on 
March 17 and 18 . The concerts 
also feature guest artists. 
James Bonn of USC and 
Edward Harkins of UCSD 
accompanied the symphony's 
performances this season. Also 
included in its itinerary of 
events are mall concerts· at 
University Towne Centre, 

Large orchestral and choral 
music are the specialties of 
David Cha e ' s La Jolla 
University/Civic Chorus . 

" The class consists of pure 
rehearsal ," said Chase of the 
group, which is offered on

Script Follows Novel; Black McMurphy Excellent 

M r. Wasserman'sadap-tation of Cuckoo's Nest was prior to the 
writing of the screen-

play. and is more faithful than 
the screenplay to Kesey's plot 
and characters. The action is. 
in this adaptation as in the 
novel, firmly grounded in 
Nurse Ratched's ward of the 
mental hospital. and the scenes 
leading up to the hero's final 
debacle with and defeat at the 
hands of tile Big Nurse are 
concise. discrete and imagistiC. 
Thus the adaptation was not as 
treacherous as many novel-to-
stage conversions, while at the 
same time it removes just a bit 

of Kesey's tendentiousness. 
making for a less relentless 
work of art, 

The star of Cuekoo's Nesl is 
Randle Patrick McMurphy, a 
swaggering, brawling Irish-
man fresh off the work farm. 
played by Mr, R. Wiley-Pitts. I 
was somewhat taken . aback 
when I saw that McMurphy is 
played by a black man, but 
upon reflection one realizes 
that the choice was excellent. 
Though not nearly so accom-
plished an ' actor as Jack 
Nicholson, Wiley-Pitts ' 
characterization does come 
closer to the mental image of 
R.P. McMurphy formed by this 
reporter. and not until late in 
the production does McMurphy 
the person get swa llowed by 
McMurphy the Hero. 

McMurphy is more than the 
stereotyped Irish trouble-
maker: he establishes this very 
early in the story. by showing 
a n affinity for · one ' of the 
patients. Mr. Harding. Mr. 
Harding is an intellectual , 
which puts him in',the curious 
poSition of knowi~g exactly 
what is wrong with ·him. while 
remaining entirely powerless 
to help himself. ':He and 
McMurphy begin immediately 
trading wit and friendly insults. 
and it is the extent to which 
their cautious friend hip 
develops which al low s 
McMurphy to become inte-
grated with the others. rather 
than rest entirely above them. 
as a aviour. Dill Maass does 
quite well as Hurding in this 
crucial role of intermediary. 

though he is perhaps a shade 
too self-consciously neurotic. 

The rest of the loonies leave 
nothing to be desired. in casting 
or performance (which says 
something. I'm not sure what) . 
are all really hilarious and 
twisted and true to their 
chara cters. 

The finest is David Flint's 
Billy Bibbit t. another crucial 
cha ra cter, the stutteri ng. guilt- . 
ridden , revoltingly horribly 
oedipal young man. a virgin of 
twenty-odd years, whom 
McMurphy tries to help with 
disastrous results. 

The main drawback of this 
production is typified by the 
performance of John C. Orr as 
Chief Bromden. The Marquis is 
definitely fortunate to have

solemn and stilted . He is the 
narrator and a central figure in

Commentary /Beth Accomando 

Os cars Miss Two Calls 
Fonda Obnoxious, Voight Miscast, DeNiro Stunning 

W hen Johnny Carson called the Oscars 
" two hours of spar-

kling entertainment spread out 
over a four-hour show. " he 
summed the Awards up 
precisely. This year. as the 50 
years before. the Oscars prove 
a mix of entertainment and 
monotony, satisfaction and 
frustration. From my sub-
jective viewpOint. the de-
serving winners were Lord 
Laurence Olivier (a special 
Oscar) . Maggie Smith (sup-
porting actress Oscar) and The 
Deer Hunter (best director. 
film . supporting actor. editing 
and sound) : the less pleasing 
winners were Jon Voight and 
Jane Fonda (best actor and 
actress) . 

On the negative side of the 
Oscars stands the frustrating 
wins by Coming Home. Coming 
Home merits a great deal of 
praise for being the one to 
break the silence about the 
Vietnam war, but a a work of 
art it is a disappointment. It 
offers a contri ved story that 
ignores its own potential. In 
Coming Home radicalism is the 
only redemption from war, but 
this limited solution prevents 
the film from really looking at 
the effects of war. 

One of Coming Home's major 
flaws was casting Voight as the 
embittered paraplegic. Voight 
has none of the suppressed 
inner rage that his character 
needs to be believable. He also 
fails to 'give his c haracter a 
subconscious or an inner sense 
of being. (DeNiro's stunning 
performance in The Deer 
Hunter vastly urpasses 
Voight's acting) . Voight. who 
deserved an Oscar for Midnight 
Cowboy. was simply miscast 
and undeserving of this year 's 
Oscar. 

As for Fonda , as an actress 
she is one of the finest. but as a 
person she is becoming an 
obnoxious megalomaniac. 
Fonda's acting deserves an 
Oscar. but her acceptance 
speech was an exercise in 
pretentiousness. Her use of sign 
language seemed too calcu-
lated to be anyt hing but 
distasteful. Additionally her 
remarks in recent interviews ' 
reveal her a an unlikeable 
person. For example. she has 
condemned The Deer Hunter 
und advises that no one should 
see it, yet she has never seen 
the film. Also she has 
proclaimed her dislike of Oscar 
campaigning a she appears on 
all the talk shows saying that 
she wants to win the Oscar. 

Although I am glad that the 
Ilctress Fonda won an Oscar. I 
am upset that the person Fonda 
won. 

The most controversial film 
of the evening as well as the 
best was Michael Cimino's The 
Deer Hunler. The Deer Hunler 
was a mbst worthy winner since 
it is a powerfully effective film 
with an even stronger and 
broader anti-war statement 
than the more narrow-visioned 
Coming Home. 

The criticism levied against 
The Deer Hunler for showing a 
ste reo typical view of the 
Vietnamese as savages is an 
unfair one. Wbereas stereo-
typing is never a virtue. it is not 
always a naw. Cimino using 
stereotyping to show that war 
makes people savage (a 
concept not unfounded) ; he 
could have, however. balanced 
the film by showing Americans 
also behaving savage ly . 
Cimino a lso could not create 
more complex Vietnamese 
characters because of the time 
factor and because he is dealing 
with a story that needs a 
fundamental source of evil. But 
despite controversy The Deer 
Hunter is the most outstanding 
film of the year.

Anti-Smoking Moves 
Made On All Levels 
(Continued from page 2) 

In california. for example, the industry recently poured more 
, than" million into a successful campaign to defeat Proposition 
5. an initiative aimed at tightening public smoking regulations. 
The Tobacco Institute estimates some 200 measures designed 
to limit smoking were introduced in state legislatures alone 
during 1977. Besides funding campaigns against such 
proposals. the Institute ha~ sent more than 3,000 fette rs to police 
chiefs arguing that local smoking ordinances would divert 
police from apprehending " real criminals." 

The industry is also unnerved by an estimate by the Oartnell 
Institute of Dusiness Research that more than three percent of 
all US firms are now actually paylrii their workers to stop 
smoking. The Johns-Manville Corporatian, upon learning its 
asbestos workers who smoked stood a 92 times-higher-than-
average chance of developing lung cancer, banned smoking in 
all 14 of its asbestos plants. 

In San Francisco. attorney Melvin Belli is representing 
leveral children of a woman who died of lung cancer. In what 
could become a precedent-setting case, the lawsuit charges 
major cigarette manufacturers with liability for selling a 
product to the woman that they knew, or should have known , 
causes cancer. 8e1ll argues that advertising " makes" people 
smoke, and that tobacco's addictive components prevent them 
from quitting. 

Freshm.an 
Surprises 
(Coll&laaecl from pail'S) 

While at first turned-off by 
the idea (I was a retiring 
freshman) . guilt finally got to 
me. I had a sincere commit-
ment to ~voidlng freshman 
body-rot. And besides. some of 
the guys on the men 's Varsity 
team were pretty cute. Maybe 
I'd run into one of them in the 
tunnels below the gym .... 

The first practice. twe nty 
girls of va rious heights a nd 
widths crowded a round the 
coach. She pointed to me. " You, 
in the purple s horts - Purple 
Shorts - do a lay-up." What 
was a lay-up??? (I had never 
played bas ke tba ll be fore). 
Shit! My feet glued to the floor. 
I threw the coach a cas ua lly 
puzzled look. She told me to 
ta ke thirty freethrows instead 
a nd I missed them a ll. ' Arter 
that the rest of practice went 
pretty we ll . I was rota ted out. 

I spe nt the res t of the season 
trying to e nd th e c oac h 
casua lly puzzled looks and was 
misdiagnosed as a pace-cadet. 
My teammates ga ve me a kite 
a fter the 1"15t game .

(Continued from page 5) 

Mexican Snub 
We in this country exercise a foreign policy of benign neglect at 

best wi th regard to Mexico and Lati n America genera lIy. a nd the 
president of the United States goes down there .. . so Portillo is in 
real trouble. He wants to cooperate, but how does he 
domestically survive a nd not acknowledge to his people at least 
tha t he's been getting the short end from the US. So Ca rter goes 
down there. and to the world at la rge , Portillo lurns around and 
castigates him publicly. So what 's the president do? He sort of 
stands there and scowls , and says tha nk you .. . My fri ends on the 
right say we should respond build a " Tortilla curta in ." It's 
ridiculous to do tha t . but conversely, the style in which it was 
done reflects a lack of leadership in the minds of third world 
countries. 

The Revolution in Iran 
(The revolution in) Ira n was a tota lly indigenous movement. 

There was nothing we could have done but be better pre pa red for 
wha t was happening i( our CIA hadn 't been so in bed with the 
Ira nia n secret police. But I don ' t know a nyone who knows the 
issues who suggests that that was manipulated from outside. that 
that was a Soviet plot. The Soviets a re attempting to ta ke 
advantage of it. I grant that. But it is not an external movement. 
The President made the right decision. to do nothing. But in the 
process. he made it look like we were so goq-da rned 
accommodating that we had no preference in the matter.

because, the spokesman said , " use of AS facilities is not covered · 
under the elections code. " . 

A compla int against the new indicator, which the Question 
Authority s late said ran articles damaging their campaign, was 
refused by the commission because it was decided that the 
elections codes have no provisions prohibiting pre-campaign
