SURF REPORT

“YOU CAN’T DO WITHOUT
GREAT STUDENTS”

The Guardian sits down with Marye Anne Fox for her 
final interview as chancellor.

By Zev hurwitZ • Associate News Editor

CHANCELLOR

Guardian: So, first of all, 
congratulations on a phenomenal 
tenure.

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox: 
Thank you and I’m glad to hear that 
you feel that way about it.

G: Well I’m a first-year, so from 
what I’ve seen it’s been pretty good (Fox 
laughs). So you’ve been chancellor for 
the better part of a decade, what were 
the biggest issues that you faced when 
you first came here?

F: Well I think the biggest issue 
any new chancellor will face is 
maintaining the quality and reputation 
and enhancing it for the faculty and 
the students of this institution, and 
it becomes particularly difficult to 

do that when we don’t have enough 
money for operations or for financial 
aid for students. So far we’ve been able 
to put together packages that make 
some sense. But we hope that we 
can continue to do so. As you know, 
things are getting tighter and tighter. 
You probably see it in class size and in 
availability of courses.

G: Do you anticipate that the same 
kind of challenges will continue for 
the next chancellor?

F: Yeah, certainly. I think the major 
issue for the next chancellor is how 
to maximize efficiency and minimize 
costs for the operation so that we can 
keep tuition as low as we possibly can.

G: Is there an easy way to 

accomplish that?
F: There is no easy way to 

accomplish it; you know we’re 
operating near the bone already, 
because we’ve had successive cuts for 
three years running and if the ballot 
initiative doesn’t pass in November 
there’s likelier to be a further 
diminishment of what we have.

G: On a broader note, what do you 
think is your biggest accomplishment 
that you’ve had as chancellor at UC 
San Diego?

F: Well I think that the 
construction program we’ve had 
provides the means by which we can 
compete for the very best. So in other 
words, if you’re a world-renowned 

scientist or physician, we have now 
the physical resources to recruit them 
in and give them a laboratory, give 
them a space to do their work. If you’re 
an undergraduate, then you probably 
can’t imagine life without the Price 
Center and we were somehow stuck 
living without it for a while and I think 
that’s had an impact on how students 
can relate to each other and to their 
faculty.

G: I think I read somewhere that 
you’re returning to teaching after this?

F: I’m on administrative leave 
for one year. What that means is: 
That’s what every chancellor gets. 
It’s supposed to be a year to retool 
intellectually, and then to decide 

what kind of tasks you’ll take on for 
the university. So on the one hand 
I might teach organic chemistry 
— it would be the 37th time I’ve 
taught chemistry if I do that — but 
I’m even more impassioned about the 
challenge posed by science and math 
education in schools in the United 
States. We’re getting students, even 
a few of them at UCSD, who aren’t 
adequately prepared in terms of 
science and math skills so I’m going 
to work with some foundations, put 
together some funding for a proposal 
of that sort. We’ll work with the Cal 
Teach program. We’ll work with some

Some undergraduates will take 
their finals in Main Gym next week 
as part of a study administered by 
the Academic Integrity Office and the 
Office of the Registrar. Approximately 
20 classes will participate in the pilot 
project, which is an experiment 
administering final exams in a “large 

common space” in order to meet 
growing classroom needs.

“We are often asked for larger 
spaces than we can provide for finals,” 
University Registrar William Haid said 
in an email.

Main Gym will be furnished 
with eight-foot long tables and three 
chairs per table to accommodate 
approximately 400 students. The 
space is accessible for students with 
disabilities and can meet whatever 
accommodation the individual student 
requested, Haid said. 

Some students have raised concerns 
about taking finals in a non-classroom 
environment, but Haid said students 
should not be alarmed or concerned 
at the change. 

“Finals are routinely given in spaces 
that are not classrooms, such as the 
Price Center Theatre and Mandeville 
Theatre,” Haid said.

Although Price Center Theatre 
is not a traditional lecture hall, 
courses are regularly held there to 
accommodate for larger class sizes.

According to Haid, UCLA, UC 
Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, University 
of Colorado at Boulder, University of 
Toronto and McGill University give 
their final exams in gymnasiums and 
non-classroom spaces.

“We would not schedule an exam 
in a space not appropriate,” Haid said.

Sea Bacterium Compound 
May Help Fight Cancer
BY AYAN KUSARI
Senior Staff Writer

Scientists at the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography have isolated a 
new and potentially cancer-fighting 
compound from a bacterium that has 
recently been making headlines for 
being destroying coral reefs.

The team published a paper 
on its findings in the May 25 
issue of “Chemistry and Biology.” 
The bacterium —  Leptolyngbya 
crossbyana —  forms enormous 
colonies in the ocean that are visible 
with the naked eye. 

The team is excited about the 
discovery of a new class of organic 
molecules the researchers have 
named “honaucins.” They are 
distinguished by the presence of a 
chlorine atom in a primary position 
— at the end of a carbon chain. 
Having a halogen atom at the end 
of a chain makes these compounds 
extremely reactive, and extremely 
unusual.

Researchers in Gerwick’s 
laboratory conducted a variety of 
tests used to determine the function

of the undergraduate instructors to 
make quality teaching, particularly in 
science and math and in engineering, 
become the norm as opposed to the 
exception and I think it is the norm on 
this campus. I think teaching is taken 
pretty seriously by most of our faculty. 

G: So is that all for further down 
the road or is that for next year?

F: Well, next year what I’m going 
to do is try to determine which is 
a more productive route. In other 
words, if I can find external funding 
for the projects that we will do or 
bring together people who share that 
common interest so education studies, 
for example, the interactions we have 
with the Preuss School you know we’ll 

see. What advances we can make and 
whether I spend my life that way if 
that’ll make a difference or not. If not, 
I’ll take up more advanced courses, 
probably graduate classes and teach 
organic [chemistry]— the grad classes 
are easier.

G: What will you miss most about 
being chancellor?

F: The fact that I have access to 
students every day of my life, people 
who are well motivated and interesting 
to be with. You can’t do without great 
students. And that’s one thing we have 
here is great students. Almost equally 
at least, we have great faculty as well.

G: What is the most important 
thing that Chancellor-Designate 
Khosla should know before he takes 
office in the fall?

F: He’s coming from one of the 
world’s best universities in his discipline 
so he is a scholar in his own right so 
he should anticipate being challenged 
by the strong students and strong 
faculty that we have here. We have a 
strong form of shared governance; the 
faculty helps the university analyze 
decisions before decisions are made. 
And they make decisions on their 
own for example the procedures for 
admission, and what degrees are going 
to be offered and what options there 
are, electives… be prepared to have 
terrific colleagues and students and 
provide them with an environment 
where they can simply thrive.

Before the last A.S. meeting of this academic year, the senators congregated in the 
Forum to hold a mini retreat, parts 
of which they referenced through-
out the meeting today.

Some mem-
bers of the 
public came to 
voice their dis-
appointment in 
the dismissal of 
Leah Wong’s 
a p p o i n t m e n t 
as AVP Local 
Affairs.

Another member of the public 
denounced A.S. President Meggie 
Le for going to New York City dur-
ing the A.S. budget meeting.

Le explained that she had gone 
to New York City to attend a con-
ference about racial climate and 
diversity. She felt that with the 
atmosphere that UCSD has had in 
previous years it would be in the 
best interests of herself, the council 
and the campus to go learn relevant 
information and bring it back.

“It’s important that you came in 
and checked in on what I’m doing, 
I’m really grateful that you came in. 
It’s nice to know that students are 
paying attention,” Le said.

Annie Le from the SSC, Susie Kim 
from the Women’s Center and Kevin 
Quirolo a member of the Public 
Education Coalition stopped by the 
council meeting to give concerns and 
suggestions in the molding of an A.S. 
UCSD Human Rights Board.

“One of our main worries is that 
this board could claim a monopoly 
on the legitimacy of human rights 
activism,” one of the presenters said. 
“It has a few shared purposes, but 
not a lot of shared tactics.”

UCSB Human Rights Board 
founder Nicolas Pascal came by to 

voice his support for A.S. UCSD’s 
attempt at creating a similar entity. 
He presented council with the his-
tory behind UCSB’s Human Rights 
Board and the work that it has done 
since then, including raising $50,000 

after the earthquake 
in Haiti in just over 
three weeks.

“This has 
immense poten-
tial and promises 
to extend beyond 
your time on this 
campus and to 

other campuses as well; this could 
become a multi-campus endeavor, 
Pascal said.

Andrew Buselt and Jillian Du 
from the Green Initiative Fund came 
by to discuss the grants they have 
allocated throughout this academic 
year and had recipients from each 
organization — BAAN, Engineers 
for a Sustainable World, Books for 
Prisoners and the Box Art Project 
— came by to explain what they’ve 
done with the money.

Michael Long from the Biofuels 
Action and Awareness Network 
explained that BAAN exists to 
develop the biofuels sector and pro-
vide a means of academic enrich-
ment through real world research. 
He said that BAAN one day hopes 
to provide campus events and fuel 
campus transportation using bio-
fuels.

Council approved AVP Academic 
Affair Sammy Chang’s decision to 
allocate his entire stipend to his staff.

SOVAC gave a presentation 
about their progress this year and 
reported that they’ve registered 
close to 2,000 students which brings 
UCSD from dead last to second 
within the course of a year in terms 
of registered voters among UC cam-
puses.

of biological molecules.
They determined that honaucins 

were lethal to many bacteria and 
could prevent inflammation--a 
biological process in humans that has 
been linked to a variety of immune 
diseases and cancer.

Honaucins are especially unique 
because they prevent other bacteria 
from reaching a certain population 
density, rather than poisoning each 
bacterium individually.

“They’re called anti-quorum 
sensing compounds,” Gerwick said. 
“They represent a completely new 
mechanism for bacteria control. It’s 
believed that it won’t give rise to 
resistance as quickly.”

Gerwick said that the finding 
was important because the effective 
lifetimes of current antibiotics are 
getting shorter and shorter.

“It used to be 10 or 15 years, and 
now it’s just a few,” he said. “Bacteria 
nowadays have built up so many 
resistance mechanisms that they can 

become resistant at an increased rate.”
According to William Gerwick, 

a professor both at Scripps and at 
Skaggs School of Pharmacy and a 
coauthor of the recently published 
paper, the Scripps team had a dual 
purpose in examining the bacteria.

“We certainly wanted to determine 
how the bacteria were killing the 
coral reefs,” he said. “But we also 
wanted to see if we could isolate any 
potentially useful compounds from 
the bacteria.”

The scientists believe the bacteria 
bleach coral reefs by secreting an 
as-yet unidentified poison.

“We don’t know all the 
mechanistic details,” Gerwick said. 
“But we noticed bleaching occurred 
even where bacteria were absent. 
That gave us a clue that it might be a 
toxin that was doing it.”

Leptolyngbya is too new to have a 
common name, but it is closely related 
to “Angel’s hair alga” or Cladophora 
albida. It was first discovered just 
two years ago, causing irreversible 
damage to coral off the Kona coast 

in Hawaii. 
The bacterium is believed to 

be native to Hawaii and is usually 
inconspicuous. But in 2009, an 
enormous bloom, or rapid increase 
in algal population, caused hundred 
of miles of coral reef to “bleach” or 
turn white. Bleaching indicates that 
the organisms making up a coral reef 
have died.

“There’s a kind of irony to all 
this that amazes me,” Gerwick said. 
“Here’s this organism that’s killing 
coral, that has within it the capacity 
to treat a variety of human disease. 
What is it that they say? One man’s 
trash is another man’s treasure.” 

The researchers have isolated 
other compounds from the bacteria, 
but Gerwick says they have yet to 
make determinations about their 
structure and biological activity.

“Some things look really 
promising. But it’s too early to say 
anything for certain yet,” he said.

While the juicy pork serves as an excellent repository 
for the shack’s special aioli, a mayo-corn-tomato-pep-

JUNE 22 – In a move that will make 
history, Pixar is releasing its �rst �lm 
that features a female protagonist this 
summer. “Brave,” fronted by feisty 
ginger tomboy Merida, is set in the 
Scottish highlands during the Middle 
Ages. And Merida will clearly be 
the centerpiece of Pixar’s latest 3-D 
masterpiece — a�er all, the movie’s 
teaser poster is mostly dominated by a 
huge shock of red hair.
     �e story follows the format 
of a traditional fairy tale. Merida 

shuns her society’s 

expectations of her eventual 
transformation into a “lady.” She has 
no intention of becoming a princess; 
instead, she takes pride in her ability 

to �ght and shoot arrows, making 
her the veritable Katniss Everdeen of 

dystopic olde-timey Scotland. A little 
magic in the form of a “wise woman” 
dooms her family and the kingdom, 
and it’s up to Merida to save the day.
     Pixar is sure to deliver a�er its most 
recent �op, “Cars 2.” �e cast features 
“Harry Potter” favorites Emma 
�ompson and Robbie Coltrane. 
And if that isn’t enough to pique 
your interest, the delightful, Oscar-
nominated animated short “La Luna” 
precedes the �lm.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JUNE 7,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9

JUNE 22 – For 
Woody Allen 
devotees and skeptics 
alike, “Midnight In 
Paris” was last year’s 

most delightful comedy, and the 
biggest hit of the proli�c director’s 
career. No doubt cashing in on its 
success, Allen will follow up that 
travelogue comedy with yet another 
travelogue comedy — only this time 
he’s trading France for Italy. Initially 
titled “�e Bop Decameron,” before 
being changed to “Nero Fiddled” 
and, �nally, “To Rome With Love,” 
the �ick is a broad comedy (not a 
romantic comedy, according to Allen) 

composed of four interwoven tales, 
one of which stars the director himself 
— on screen for the �rst time since 
2006’s “Scoop.”
     Since he’s now 
too old to play 
the romantic lead 
himself, the real 
Woody will be 
played by Jesse 
Eisenberg, the 
obvious successor 
to his brand of neurotic comedy. �e 
�lm will also star Allen alums Alec 
Baldwin, Judy Davis and Penelope 
Cruz (who won an Academy 
Award in his 2008 romcom “Vicky 

Cristina Barcelona”) and newcomers 
Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page (who 
incidentally looks a lot like Allen 

mainstay Jessica 
Harper). �ough the 
actual plot remains a 
mystery — much like 
the plot of “Midnight 
In Paris” was before 
its release — there’s no 
one in cinema quite as 
dependable as Woody, 

leading us to believe that “Rome” will 
be yet another hit for the director, 
bolstered by a �awless reputation and 
an intriguing cast.

JULY 3 – Say what you will about 
the “premature” reboot — “�e 
Amazing Spider-Man” will be, as its 
name suggests — amazing. Andrew 
Gar�eld (“�e Social Network”) 
replaces vanilla Tobey McGuire in 
the legendary role of Peter Parker. 
�is time, the �lm will focus on 
Parker’s development in high school 
as he tries to discover the truth 
behind his parents’ disappearance. 
And the main love interest isn’t 
feisty-but-not-the-way-Kristen-
Dunst-played-her MaryJane Watson 
— it’s the little known Gwen Stacey, 
played by Emma Stone (“Easy A,” 
“Zombieland”).
     What is most exciting about this 
movie isn’t the fresh, beautiful cast. 
It’s Andrew Gar�eld’s self-proclaimed 
fanboy excitement about the role. 
When the �lm was teased at Comic 
Con last year, a fan in a Spider-
Man suit walked up expressing his 
excitement about the movie before 

removing his mask to 
reveal that he was, in 
fact, Andrew Gar�eld 
himself. In several 
interviews, Gar�eld 
has told anecdotes 
about reciting the original Spider-
Man’s monologues into a mirror 
when he was younger, only to have 
friends tell him that he could never 
be Spider-Man. �ey must be eating 
their words now.
     �ere are so many rebooted 
changes from the original franchise 
that have been slowly released since 
this past summer — all have been 
rehashed over and over on blogs 
everywhere. But one thing is certain 
— “�e Amazing Spider-Man” is a 
fanboy movie, made by fanboys for 
fanboys. Hopefully, they leave the 
emo-Spidey suit back in “Spider-
Man 3,” where it belongs.

The Amazing Spider-Man

JULY 20 – �ere’s something 
poetic about the timing of “�e Dark 
Knight Rises”— while America’s 
economy spirals downward to 
depressing lows, on screen, director 
Christopher Nolan’s wealthy antihero 
emerges from an eight-year absence 
to save a bedraggled Gotham City 
from a juggernaut. It’s di�cult to 
ignore the real-life parallels — and 
though the boilerplate aspects of an 
action-driven, explosive blockbuster 
are there, the �nal installment of 
the Batman trilogy also promises 
to address all those uncomfortable 
Marxist issues you’ve been sitting on. 
     Proof positive: Stoic and hoarse, 
Bale’s Batman — now with two 
successful installments and an Oscar 
under his utility belt — canoodles 
with a slinky Selina Kyle (Ann 
Hathaway) at a party, while her 

rose-red lips inform him that the 
downfall of Gotham’s upper class 
is imminent. Hated by them but 
beloved by us, Batman’s ongoing 
struggle as the (�lthy rich) underdog 
somehow continues to resonate with 
the (dirt poor) American audiences. 
It’s nothing short 
of “Inception” 
on Nolan’s part, 
who managed to 
turn away from 
historically campy 
representations 
of heroism to a 
dark, gritty and 
bloody adaptation that Americans 
identify with in times of crisis. And 
if that won’t bring in crowds — then 
luckily, Hathaway’s catsuit will.

The Dark Knight Rises

JUNE 8 – A�er working hard to 
disassociate himself from his sci-
� roots, Ridley Scott returns this 
summer to his old stomping ground. 
“Prometheus,” originally developed as 
a ��h entry in the “Alien” franchise, 
retells the favorite fable of the origin 
of mankind: that humans were put 
on Earth by aliens. Before it was cast 
aside in favor of “Alien vs. Predator,” 
Scott was working with James 
Cameron, developing a prequel, set 
before the start of “Alien.” Since its 
reboot, though, the screenplay has 
been rewritten to exist as a stand-
alone �lm — but don’t worry, from 

the looks of it, there will still be plenty 
of face-gnawing extraterrestrials.
     When it was shelved back in 2003, 
it seems Cameron just couldn’t let 
go of his grand sci-� vision, and 
so Avatar was put into production. 
And in keeping with any �lm James 
Cameron has touched, the scale of 
“Prometheus” seems just as gigantic. 
Ridley Scott himself isn’t known for 
his small-scale visions either (think 
of the world he created in “Blade 
Runner”), and with a budget of over 
$120 million, “Prometheus” will be 
anything but unimpressive. It doesn’t 
look like it’ll have quite the emotional 

he� of “Blade Runner or the slow-
building tension of “Alien,” but if it’s a 

summer spectacle you’re looking for, 
“Prometheus” likely won’t disappoint.

JUNE 27 - In the spirit of legend-
ary Italian Neorealists Rosellini and 
De Sica, newcomer writer/director 
Benh Zeitlin gathered a cast of rugged 
non-actors and a humble budget, and 
set off to break every rule in the indie 
filmmaking handbook. 

“When I was in college I was told 
that if you’re going to make movies 
don’t shoot on the water, don’t shoot 
with children and don’t shoot with 
animals,” Zeitlin said in an interview 
for this year’s Sundance Film Festival. 
“Our movie is about children and ani-
mals on boats.”

But “Beasts of the Southern Wild” 
is no desolate true-to-life melo-
drama. The plot follows a young girl, 
Hushpuppy, who lives with her father 
and community members in a flood-
ed southern town called the Bathtub. 
After a series of apocalyptic events 
begins to ravage the town, Hushpuppy 
turns to her father, a mysterious 

beastly magic and her own intuition 
to search for her mother. 

“Beasts” made the festival 
rounds this year, taking home the 
coveted first prize in the Dramatic 

Competition at Sundance, and the 
Camera d’Or prize at Cannes. If the 
goosebump-inducing trailer is any 
indication, “Beasts of the Southern 
Wild” will be a welcome addition to 
this year’s gorgeous childhood fan-
tasy/adventure trend launched by Wes 
Anderson this week.

Usher memorably melted hearts with 1998’s “Nice and Slow,” a song that 
positioned the singer as a soulful 
seducer. His almost 20-year career 
continues with the June 12 release 
of his seventh studio album, 
Looking 4 Myself.

Usher draws from the electronic 
sounds of the international dance 
scene, while staying true to his R&B 
background on the new album that 
Billboard described as “a fusion of 
electro-soul, old-school R&B and 
modern club anthems.”
 �e Diplo-produced 
“Climax,” as the album’s lead single, 
combines Usher’s R&B roots with 

electronic in�uences, keeping him a 
top contender for radio play against 
the newer, electronic and dance-
infused competition.
 �e album also features 
collaborations from producers 
Swedish House Ma�a on 
“Euphoria.”  
Usher’s performance on the May 
12 episode of “Saturday Night Live” 
showed that he is still among the 
strongest performers in popular 
music — the 33-year-old singer isn’t 
slowing down anytime soon.

Twin Shadow’s 2010 debut Forget garnered George Lewis Jr.’s solo venture a cult 
following worthy of its neo-retro-
spective take on the current trend 
of bedroom pop music.  Lewis’s 
strikingly mysterious persona 
and Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear’s 
unorthodox production style made 
for a unique combo of classic shim-
mery guitars and sparse analog 
electronics.  As instantly pleasing 
as Forget was, it appeared likely to 
remain a shot in the dark as the 
project’s creative peak.  

Set for a mid-summer July 
release date, Confess undoubtedly 
will mark a notable departure for 
Lewis and his newly accrued rep-

ertoire.  The record’s first single, 
“Five Seconds” indicates a transi-
tion from insular electro-rock to 
full-fledged power ballad status.  As 
a symptom of the band’s newfound 
strength as a vivacious live act, the 
track boasts prominent 80s guitar 
riffage, glossy synthesizers and 
heavy organic drums.  

Twin Shadow seems prepped to 
shove a serious dose of fleshed-out 
new wave nostalgia in the face of 
their listeners, and Lewis and crew 
may be the most viable candidates 
for delivering on such a road-
worn stereotype with the utmost 
sincerity. Just as they avoided jabs 
of unoriginality on their inau-
gural attempt, Confess may very 

well solidify them as the classiest 
amongst a current generation of 80s 
appropriation.

Over twelve years and four albums, London quintet Hot Chip have established 
themselves as one of the most reliable, 
innovative synth pop bands currently 
operating. From the cheesy bedroom 

funk of 2004’s Coming on Strong to 
One Life Stand’s soft rock pastiches, 
Hot Chip have successfully explored 
diverse genres, all the while forging a 
very unique style, one that combines 
a youthful sense of experimentation 
with the restraint of far more 
experienced musicians. 

The band’s next album (and first 

on an indie label since their debut), 
In Our Heads, promises to be some 
of the band’s best work yet. “Night 
and Day,” the record’s first single, is 
a gleeful house anthem that sports a 
deliciously funky bassline and some 
of Hot Chip’s most forward lyrics to 
date: “the way I feel about you baby, 
in the middle of the night, there’s just 
one thing I could do to feel alright,” 
sneers vocalist Alexis Taylor, “if I 
could be inside you darling...let’s 
sweat.” Elsewhere, the band indulges 
in tasteful vocal sampling (“These 
Chains”), classic techno synth lines 
(“Flutes”) and the kind of smooth 
acoustic guitar playing that would 
sound perfectly at home on a Red Hot 
Chili Peppers album. As a whole, the 
album is very strong, representing 
some of the most skillful songwriting 
and careful production in recent 
memory.

You may not know Audacity yet, but they’re this summer’s band to watch. Although 
this Fullerton-based band has cycled 
through name and lineup changes 
over the years, their roots can be 
traced to the fond days of second 
grade recess. The band members 
grew up together in a city rife with 
music history — from 80s punk to 
the pop-punk leanings of the 90s — 
blossoming at the perfect moment: 
the birth of Orange County’s fledg-
ling surf-rock scene.

Just at the time Burger Records 
— a Fullerton record store that spe-
cializes in producing hand-crafted 
cassette tapes — found its local 

footing, Audacity jumped on board, 
releasing Power Drowning on the 
label in 2009. 

Now, three years have passed; the 
boys are out of high school, they’ve 
been touring like mad and they’ve 
built up enough material to release 
their second LP. Mellow Cruisers’ 
first released track, “Garza Girls,” 
was inspired by the females that 
work at Garza Industries, a place 
guitarist Matt Schmalfeld delivers 
business cards to during his day job. 
It’s poppy, rife with guitar jangle and 
a deliriously catchy hook worthy of 
any summer soirée.

David Longstreth, the pri-mary songwriter and composer behind Dirty 
Projectors, has slowly become one of 
indie rock’s most progressive voices. 
The band’s most recent album, the 
magnificent Bitte Orca, was one of 
those rare albums that manages to 
be both innovative and completely 
accessible (the album’s first single, 
the stomping R’n’B epic “Stillness is 
the Move” is particularly noteworthy 
in this respect). Across the band’s 
extensive catalog — they’ve released 
eight full length albums and several 
miscellaneous releases, like the for-
charity Björk compilation Mount 

Wittenberg Orca — they’ve been 
remarkably consistent, exploring 
everything from sinuous classi-
cal avant-pop (2005’s The Getty 
Address) to punk-inspired afro-
rock (2007’s Black Flag-covering 
Rise Above). 

If early single “Gun Has No 
Trigger” is any indication, this 
summer’s Swing Lo Magellan will 
be just as remarkable: that single 
combines clever guitar work and 
a slo-mo motorik pulse with the 
kind of trademark vocal arranging 
that the group mastered on Bitte 
Orca. Get excited, because Swing Lo 
Magellan might just end up being 

one of this summer’s best albums.

After 15 years as arguably the best rapper alive, Nas is rich, confident and happy 
as ever. On Life Is Good, his 10th 
solo studio album, he seems intent 
on making sure you know just 
how great being Nasir Jones is. On 
“Nasty”, the album’s first single, 
he raps “I come from the will of 
Ezekiel/ to pop thousand dollar 
bottles of scotch/ smoke pot/ and 
heal the people.” The videos for 
“Nasty” and second single “The 
Don,” are comprised mostly of 
shots of Nas getting chauffeured in 
Rolls Royces, smoking expensive 
cigars and wearing finely tailored 
suits. 

But even though his opulent 
lifestyle sounds soft, Nas is as lyri-
cally sharp as ever. His lines have 
always been complex and quick, 

full of internal rhymes and subtle 
word-play, and if these two singles 
are any indication, Life Is Good 
will be another lyrical clinic. On 

“Nasty,” he growls, “Any rebuttal 
to what I utter get box-cuttered/ 
Count how many bad honeys I slut 
its a high number/ Name another 
nigga under the same sky that I’m 
under.” 

Nas’s legendary lyricism alone 
makes any new release of his worth 
buying. But if you need another 
reason to pick up Life is Good, 
Jay Electronica has confirmed a 
guest appearance, and Odd Future 
members Tyler, the Creator, Hodgy 
Beats and Frank Ocean are all 
reported to be recording with Nas. 
If nothing else, just buy the album 
to hear these youngsters get edu-
cated by one of the greatest to ever 
pick up a mic.

It’s been seven years since we heard anything new from Fiona Apple, the queen of angsty, 
female singer-songwriters, known 
for her mood swings, classical piano 
and sultry, one-of-a-kind voice that 
launched her career back in the 
mid 90s. Her first new album since 
2005 is set for release on June 19, 
complete with an extremely long and 
unconventional title (harkening back 
to her sophomore LP, whose epic 
title hit the 90 word mark), The Idler 
Wheel Is Wiser Than The Driver 
Of The Screw And Whipping Cords 
Will Serve You More Than Ropes 

Will Ever Do.
If you’re a cult follower, or just 

looking for a deeper, more lyrically 
complex version of Florence and 
the Machine or Adele, do yourself a 

favor and check out the long awaited 
return of this co-founder of the 
modern alternative singer/song-
writer genre. “Every Single Night,” 
the first single from the new LP, is a 
bit more whimsical than the brood-
ing, multi-instrumental ballads we 
are used to, but it delivers the same 
unbridled creativity and poignant 
relatability that only Apple could 
provide. The Tidal Wave... will arrive 
just in time to be the soundtrack for 
some of the darker, more introspec-
tive days of your summer.

It’s been nearly three years since the behemoth Merriweather Post Pavilion, but Animal 
Collective is finally set to return 
this summer with their anticipated 
ninth studio album, Centipede 
Hz.  During their hiatus, the band 
has been hard at work transform-
ing their sound and style with a 
flurry of highly experimental and 
lucrative solo projects — from Avey 
Tare’s trippy 2010 release Down 
There, to Panda Bear’s triumphant 
Tomboy just last year.  

In a 2011 interview with the 
Baltimore Sun, Avey Tare stated 
that the band wanted a “more 
immediate, hard-hitting set with 
more rhythm” on their next release. 
With the band now back to a four 
piece (founding member Deakin 
returned this year), and Panda Bear 

back behind a full drum kit (some-
thing fans have longed for since 
Here Comes the Indian), Centipede 
Hz is sure to give us the most 
organic, energetic and physical 
Animal Collective record yet.  

The rumored concept behind 
Centipede Hz consists of an alien 
band from another planet sampling 
sounds from Earth — reversing the 
psychedelia cliché of a human band 
attempting to recreate interstellar 
sounds. The band recently released 
pre-album single “Honeycomb” 
to give fans a taste of their new 
aesthetic — a thumping mix of 
pitch-shifting percussion and one 
of the catchiest Animal Collective 
choruses since Feel’s “Grass.”

Ty Segall does not stop. In collaboration with sev-eral OC and SF bands, he’s 
already worked on a dozen albums, 
as well as four excellent solo 
records since 2008. Earlier this year, 
Segall released Hair, a collaboration 
with White Fence, and he plans to 
release another solo album in the 
fall, begging the question: When 
does this guy sleep?

Slaughterhouse is the first album 
under the moniker Ty Segall Band, 
Segall’s full touring band, which 
includes his former University of 
San Francisco classmate Emily 
Rose Epstein on drums, Charlie 
Moothart of the Moonhearts and 
Mikal Cronin, SF native, solo artist 

and long-time Ty collaborator.
From the name alone, it’s clear 

that Slaughterhouse will be harder 
and louder than the previous 
pysch-pop/garage rock endeavors 
Segall is usually associated with. If 
the pre-release track “I Bought My 
Eyes” is any indication, recording 
with friends who are usually only 
present in live settings has amped 
the volume, fuzzed out the riffs and 
left any semblance of restraint at 
the door.

I’ve been in denial that I’m graduating soon. I wonder if I’m where my wide-eyed freshman self wanted to be. I 
feel like I’ve gained a lot of confi-
dence this year alone, but I’m still 
mistaken for being 19 when I’m 
turning 22 next week, and I’m not 
quite sure what the future holds for 
me. 

We’ve all questioned if UCSD 
was the right choice for us — sure, 
the campus gets a bad reputation as 
being ‘socially dead,’ but college is 
really what you make of it. UCSD 
was the right choice for me — I’ve 
met so many great people and I feel 
like I’ve really come into my own 
here.   

It’s hard for me to believe that 
I’m in my last week as an undergrad 
and soon my life won’t involve daily 
trips to PC, meandering through 
the bookstore and staying ten hours 
every Wednesday and Sunday to 
make sure the news is delivered 
to the student body. I admit that I 
worried more about making sure we 

had enough content than studying 
for midterms.

My favorite part of college was 
definitely the last two years, and 
it wasn’t until my junior year that 
I joined the Guardian as a news 
writer and found a new way to learn 
about the campus and interact with 
people I’d never know otherwise. 
Thanks to everyone who made this 
an incredible last year of college, 
and especially to the Guardian staff 
for being a great team to work with.    

To Zev: Thanks for being such a 
great associate. Sometimes I forget 
that you’re only a freshman. The 
section is in great hands with you at 
its helm. NEWS! *high five*

To Angela: Thank you for every-
thing. I really learned this year how 
tough working in news can be, and 
I wouldn’t have rebounded without 
your guidance and your faith in me.

To Margaret: Thanks for always 
helping us out. I’m definitely going 
to miss your sass. Smang it gurl.

To Rachel: Aaliyah forever.
To Rebecca: Horwitz and 

Hurwitz will be unstoppable! Cool 
cool cool.

To Laira: Hunnids, hunnids.
To Arielle: Thank you for always 

making news look so awesome. 
You’re so talented, and I love that 
you know how to tap dance.

To Daniel: I’m so glad to have 
met you this year. You’ve got a really 
good heart.

To the rest of the editors and 
staff: Thank you all for being so 
much fun to work with. Most of you 
are younger than me, and I always 
took inspiration in how mature, 
dedicated, talented and ambitious 
you guys are. 

To my roomies: I love you guys. 
To my Ascension 10-11 family: 

Joining Ascension was one of the 
best decisions I made at UCSD. I 
miss you guys all the time.

To my bookstore crew: You guys 
are cool. I never have to work at 115 
again!

To Cathy: What am I going to do 
without you in my life? I miss you 
already.

This wouldn’t be a real Guardian goodbye if it weren’t deliriously scrawled at the Treehouse 
Lounge. I’ve had 32 ounces of luke-
warm coffee, two Domino’s pizzas, 
and one (1) bag of Doritos. There 
are a few hours until the paper goes 
to print, and a few minutes until my 
phone buzzes with that first check-
in from an editor — one not unlike 
the kind I used to send, but nicer, 
probably, and less riddled with pas-
sive aggression. 

I’ve never been able to say good-
bye. There’s so much expectation 
for wisdom and poignancy  — for 
words that explode with truth, that 
suspend an editor’s instinct to blud-
geon and rearrange with red ink, 
and that make everyone pause to 
say: Fuck. He’s right. (We’re not A.S. 
Council; there will be no finger-
snapping in the reading of these 
farewells).

I don’t know what I can say. I 
don’t have words to move moun-
tains, nor my favorite editor, who 
has never ever cried (except for that 
one time she had shingles). 

What I can tell you is that I’ve 
never felt the same sense of belong-
ing or purpose or frustration or 
anxiety that this paper has made me 
feel. When it’s good, it rains Miller 
High Life and letters to the editor; 
when it’s bad, there are tears and 
sweat and vomit and, invariably, 
carne asada fries.  

And now, without further mop-
ing, the only reason to read on: 
shout-outs.

Alyssa: You taught me early on 
that a campus planning story is 
no place for a “Gossip Girl” refer-
ence, and you never made me stop 
twinking the page, no matter how 

close we were to sunrise. I owe you 
at least another year’s worth of Red 
Bull. 

Simone: I’ll probably never work 
for someone whose vision I respect 
as much as I do yours. More impor-
tantly, I will definitely never work 
for someone as capable/tireless a 
dance partner. 

Kelsey: I still don’t know how 
you’re such a ray of sunshine. One 
day, we will jazzercise.  

Neda: NEDA!!! You’re right. I 
do hate cats. But I love you, and if 
it weren’t already a given, I’m keep-
ing you on call for the rest of our 
adult lives for impromptu front-seat 
dance party. 

Hayley: I have something impor-
tant to tell you, Hayley Martin. I 
accept your proposal on one non-
negotiable condition: lasagna and 
peppermint bark. Which is two 
conditions, really, but they are both 
important ones. Also, hi, I love you. 

Angela: I’m always amazed by 
you. And really: when you run the 
world, please do remember the little 
gingers who knew you way back 
when. I’m grasping for the right 
Robyn lyric, but I can confidently 
say: You ‘n’ me together, Trangie C. 
4-ever. 

Arielle: From the combina-
tion Pizza Hut ‘n’ Taco Bell to 
Whisknladle. I couldn’t be prouder 
of us. See you in the Bay. 

Yelena: Oh, Nana, I can’t count 
all the ways I love you. Was there 
ever a little spoon so perfectly sized 
to my boney torso? Was there ever a 
suga bitch so sweet, and yet so ice-
cold? The answer, obviously, is no. I 
love you like my own child. 

Thanks for everything, 
Guardian. It was a sweet dream and 
a beautiful nightmare.

Alright, Guardian, I forgive you.I forgive you for the 22-hour work days, for the red-bull-and-Plaza-chicken-wings 
diets, for two years of one-day weekends, 
and for stories that fell through at 4 p.m. 
on a Wednesday. I forgive you for Scylla 
and Charybdis, for Hayley Martin, and for 
the move to Google Docs. I even forgive 
you for Ronald Reagan. 

Because even when I look back at the 
worst you had to throw at me, I still can’t 
regret a single thing. The Guardian intro-
duced me to the most fascinating people, 
and taught me to write about them. A 
sink-or-swim ascendency to News Editor 
(where, admittedly, I did sink for a bit) 
taught me to kick ass and take names (and 
colleges, and school years), and occasion-
ally apologize when the ass I kicked was 
the wrong one. This paper has made me 
more capable in ways that nothing else 
ever has.

So much credit goes to the girl who 
was by my side for all this. Angela, light of 
my life. Kaiser of my heart. Official biogra-
pher. We have been through a baptism by 
fire and the Strait of Messina besides, and 
come out stronger than any newspaper 
duo has the right to be. I fully expect you 
to rule the world someday. I adore you.

To my girls: Thank you for sticking 
with me all these years (especially sopho-
more and junior year, where 20-hour work 
days twice a week made me Not Very 
Much Fun to be around). Thank you for 
listening to my ranting, giving me quotes 
when I needed “student input,” and even 

occasionally reading the paper. None of 
this would have been possible without 
your unflagging, if somewhat exasperated, 
support.

And though the people who brought 
me to the Guardian have been gone for 
quite some time now, that doesn’t change 
the fact that they had more to do with who 
I am today than the best professors this 
school has to offer. Thank you guys, truly, 
for everything.

Emku, you will always be my space 
fairy. Neda, Trevor: My ginger brigade. 
Can we just marry each other already? It 
would make Sunday morning Farmer’s 
Market trips so much more convenient. 
Arielle, Margaret: I’m glad the paper is 
in your hands, and I am so unspeakably 
proud of what it is becoming with you to 
guide it. 

All the other beautiful baby Guardians, 
it has been a privilege to get to know such 
talented people, even if most of what I did 
this quarter was sit around the office while 
you were all trying to be productive and 
say things like “Did you know Andrew 
Garfield and Emma Stone are dating 
now?” Which I realize in retrospect may 
not have been helpful. If I had the word 
count, I would thank you all for a mil-
lion pages (but one special mention goes 
to Ren: We survived a kangaroo attack 
together; now I know we can do anything).

And now, the Chilean Sea Bass-
Protector and award winner of “Most 
Comforting Bosoms” is hitting the road. 
Peace, my friends. We’ll always have Anza 
Borrego. ANDREW OH/GUARDIAN



8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JUNE 7,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

I should begin by explaining the photograph. This is a photo-graph of my final art project as a UCSD undergrad. As a VIS 
major, I have been asked to conceive 
the unimaginable and believe in the 
incredible. The prompt for this final 
project was “Apocalypse.” Most envi-
sion “Apocalypse” to be the end of the 
world with zombies, aliens, and the 
obliteration of the human race, but 
my interpretation is a personal apoca-
lypse, the end of a phase in my life.

So this project marks the apoca-
lypse of my academic career at UCSD.

The three years of college have 

been an insane whirlwind for me, and 
I am so proud and somewhat pained 
to say that The Guardian has been the 
center of it all. Being part of this orga-
nization—and family—has caused 
some heartache, but I have loved and 
learned so much that it has made it 
more than worthwhile. I think it takes 
a certain kind of masochist to work in 
journalism, and I respect all the stu-
dents that work so hard to publish this 
newspaper twice a week.

I read in a book once that life 
takes a little time and a lot of relation-
ships. Sure, I’ve learned how to use 
Photoshop and craft a near-perfect 

resume. That’s all important; however, 
I’ve also learned how to help create a 
habitable and inviting environment 
for not only my co-workers but all 
the people in my life. I’m still far from 
perfect—and I’ll never be—but I am 
getting better at it. And I can say that 
The Guardian was my first real crash 
course in being human.

In high school, I adhered to Virgil’s 
words “Fortune favors the bold.” To 
some extent, I still believe that, but 
now I also know that you can’t hurry 
Fortune. So I guess Steinbeck would 
be a little more appropriate now: 
“Don’t worry about losing. If it is 

right, it happens—the main thing is 
not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.” 
It’s frustrating to wait on circum-
stance and most times people, but I’ve 
learned that if you work long and hard 
enough towards a goal and encourage 
those around you to work just as hard, 
things begin to change drastically.

So I want to thank Regina and 
Emily for supporting me through 
my many Guardian endeavors and 
always offering sound advice. Thank 
you to Trevor and Arielle for the best 
illustration ideas ever; Guardian Art 
will never be the same. Thank you to 
Hayley and John for helping me do 

my own job back in the days when 
I didn’t even know how to turn on a 
Mac. Thank you endlessly to Margaret 
for always making time for me, and 
Angela for not only inspiring my best 
work, but also encouraging me on 
my low days. Thank you to Jeffrey 
for stepping up, and I sincerely wish 
you the very best as you boldly take 
on this section. And beyond The 
Guardian, thank you to Trang, Vivian, 
and Alice. There are just no words; 
you’ve become sisters to me.

With that, be fierce in your pas-
sions and ever fiercer in your compas-
sion.

In my first year at UCSD, I was obsessed with “Gilmore Girls”. The fashion, the town, the witty quips; I loved it all — but 
mainly, I really wanted to be Rory 
Gilmore. It was this compulsion (and 
shamefully nothing more intelligent, 
like a Hunter S. Thompson biography) 
that brought me to the glass doors 
of The Guardian the week of the San 
Diego fires.  

I didn’t read many publications at 
all (it showed in my writing) but the 
Hiatus editor at the time — a beautiful 
and Amazonian blonde by the name 
of Simone Wilson — took a chance on 
me.  Half a decade later, I’ve had the 
pleasure of covering Coachella, shak-
ing hands with Oscar winners and 
staying up until 3 a.m. while my brain 
bleeds headlines. So, thanks Guardian 
— for the good times and the bad, 
for the friends and the Pecots, for the 
late nights and the early mornings. 
I’ve learned and loved way more than 
I could ever express in 500 (fucking) 
words.

Forrest, Chelsea, Emma — Do 
werk. You’re stuck with me, until the 
end of time. Simone, Reza, Alyssa, 
Vishal, Kelsey — Thanks for teach-
ing me how to be. It was hard to say 
goodbye to you guys. Trevor, all I 
can say is that I’m glad our friend-
ship has been a reflection of how we 
met — giggly, dorky, loving and full of 
dancing. You are irreplaceable. Yelena, 
mi amor, my Mila, my sugar bitch, the 
best I never had. There ain’t no sun-
shine when you’re gone, baby. Your 
happiness is infectious.

Margaret, blood of my blood 
— I will miss our geek-out sessions 
immensely.  You will always have a 
special place in my heart, as the won-
derful young woman who saw the end 
of a magical era with me in the sum-
mertime. Only you can understand 
the magnitude of such an event. Also: 
Don’t cut your hair. Arielle, PIC.  The 
Abed to my Troy, Bonnie to my Clyde, 
Jekyl to my Hyde. I am so proud of 
your strength. You have a lot of talent, 
so don’t think I’m going to let you get 

away anytime soon. Mina, you are a 
diva in the making. More heels, more 
swag, less fear, all class. Show ‘em how 
we do, homegirl — if anyone is going 
to start changing the way Americans 
see us, it’s you. Angela, I am so 
impressed by you. You are so much 
more than a hardworker and a good 
friend — you’re an inspiration. You 
run this motha, babygirl—and you 
run it well. Hayley, it’s kind of unfair 
that you’re so good at so many things. 
It’s shocking that you haven’t devel-
oped an ego about yourself (lesser 
women have). In fact — you are a 
very kind and genuinely caring person 
— and that’s going to carry you way 
farther in this world than a man ever 
could.  Ren, I’m so glad you came into 
our little Guardian family. Big, awe-
some and weirdly artistic things lie in 
your future. Maddie —You are ASL: 
Artistic, Sugar Mama, Lovely. Laura 
and Kelly — Thank you for holding 
my hand when I needed you most. 
Countdown to graduation begins, and 
I can’t wait to see what’s next for us.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JUNE 7,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 15

Nick Howe finishes his colle-
giate career with two NCAA DII 
National Championships, three All-
American honors and an unparal-
leled streak of four consecutive 
CCAA Championships. Howe was 
chosen as this year’s NCAA West 
Region Field Athlete of the Year.

With his school record of 231’3”, 

or 70.49 m, Howe has qualified for 
the 2012 Olympic Trials in Eugene, 
Ore. His mark there could signifi-
cantly bump up the school record 
and allow him to compete for the 
U.S. in the upcoming 2012 London 
Olympics. Howe’s career was book-
ended by CCAA Freshman of the 
Year honors in 2009 and CCAA Field 
Athlete of the Year in 2012. Howe 
won Cal/Nevada in 2010 and 2011 
and garnered back-to-back Breitbard 
Athletic Hall of Fame Star of the 

Month Awards for June of 2010 and 
2011.

As Head Team Captain this year, 
Howe helped his young event group 
earn 39 points at conference, more 
than Humboldt State’s entire women’s 
team in all events.

After lead-
ing the softball 
team to its first 
ever NCAA 
Division II 
N a t i o n a l 
Championship 
in 2011, Patti 
G e r c k e n s 
came up just 
short in 2012, as the No. 24 Tritons 
finished in second behind No. 1 
Valdosta State.

In her 20th season at the helm, 
Gerckens not only saw the Tritons 

to their second ever College World 
Series, but also steered the squad 
back from the brink. Clinching an 
uncertain last seed in the confer-
ence tournament, the Tritons’ 23-13 
conference record would not be 
enough to qualify for the National 
Tournament. 

In a valiant mid-season turn-
around, Gerckens rallied the team 
to upset in both the West Regionals 
and Super Regionals, before the 
Tritons fell in the title game. 

C o m i n g 
out swing-
ing, freshman 
mid-dis t ance 
sprinter Sabrina 
P i m e n t e l 
knocked more 
than five sec-
onds off her 
personal best at 
Cal/Nevada in the 800m open before 
earning her place on the school-
record-setting All-American 4x400m 
team at the NCAA National Meet. 

Pimentel finished second at the 

CCAA conference meet in the 800m 
while also helping to take the 4x400m 
crown from first-seeded San Francisco 
State. For her performance at the 
CCAAs Pimentel took Freshman of 
the Year honors.

Pimentel is the first freshman to 
earn All-American since Kelly Fogarty 
five years ago, and is now sitting sec-
ond on the UCSD All-Time list for the 
800m with plenty of room to grow.

On their home court, one game 
away from the Elite Eight, the first-
seeded Tritons found themselves 
down by 12 points in the second half 
to second-seed Alaska Anchorage.

In the second half, the Tritons 
found a way to shut down 6’2” 
Anchorage center Hanna Johansson, 
cutting the lead down to one point 
with 10 minutes remaining. The 
match remained close down the 

stretch, but senior sharpshooter 
Daisy Feder collected the ball with 
0:51 seconds remaining, sinking a 
three-pointer to come back to with-
in one point. 

Johansson failed to convert, 
and as the Tritons raced the ball 
back down, sophomore forward 
Erin Dautremont got tied up with 
Johansson. In what should have 
been ruled a jump ball, head referee 

Lisa Ulmer penalized Dautremont, 
sending Johansson to the line to 
sink the game winning free throws.

This year 
the senior 
transfer from 
Hong Kong 
surpassed the 
former UCSD 
school record 
in the triple 
jump four 
times. The 
first time came at the CCAA meet 
against Cal State Los Angeles, where 
the senior won with the first-ever 
leap over 50’ for the Tritons. 

At nationals in Pueblo, Colorado, 
Ng was the only jumper to successfully 
complete his jump without scratching 
due to the forty mile-per hour tail 
wind. Other, less-technical jumpers 
could not keep their form and 
performed poorly, while Ng leapt 
better with every jump, breaking his 
own school record three times on the 
road to second place. Ng lost by only 
one centimeter, but ended his career 
with the best Triton mark ever.

Graduating senior Camille Gaito 
(33-12) — named the Guardian’s best 
female athlete in 2011 — will leave 
with her name all over the Triton 
record books. 

The righthander is a two-time 
All-CCAA first team selection, a two-
time All-West Region selection and a 
two-time Daktronics All-American. 
This season, Gaito pitched 17 whole 
straight games to lead the Tritons in 

the postseason. Gaito finished 2012 
with a 1.18 ERA. 

Gaito 
holds the 
school record 
for innings 
p i t c h e d 
( 8 7 7 . 2 ) , 
s t r i k e o u t s 
(617), wins 
(98), saves (9), 
app earances 
(154).

Junior Emily Adamczyk came to 
UCSD as a transfer from Division I 
UC Santa Barbara in her sophomore 
year. Competing in the breastroke 
and individual medley, Adamczyk 
finished third in the 200 breast 
stroke 400 medley relay at last year’s 
NCAA Division II Championships. 
This season, Adamczyk won the 
program’s only national title, taking 
the crown in the 200m breast stroke 
with a time of 2:13.18.

Adamczyk was also part of the 
400 medley relay squad that placed 

second.
 T h e 

2:13.18 mark 
also stands 
as the school 
record.

With their 23-13 conference 
record, the No. 24 UCSD softball 
team barely clinched the last berth 
into the CCAA playoffs. The Tritons 
outclassed their conference oppo-
nents to capture the tournament 
crown, and the automatic qualifier 
into the NCAA Division II West 
Regionals with the sixth seed. 

From there, the Tritons came 
out on top of the field of four, and 
then took down first-seed Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in three games — 
formerly undefeated on their home

In just their second-ever appear-
