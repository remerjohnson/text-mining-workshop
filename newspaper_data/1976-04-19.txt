Professor Opposed to US, Sp~in Friendship Treaty 
UCSD's Gabriel Jackson Sees Need 

for Aid in Education, Science 
by James G. Soto 

City Editor 

Since the death last year of 
Spain's Francisco Franco, there 
has been considerable 
speculation about what the future 
holds for Spain and what role 
outside forces might have in its 
development. 

One such speculator has been 
UC San Diego History professor 
Gabriel Jackson, a leading ex-
pert in the history and con-
temporary scene of Spain. 

Among the current debates 
surrounding Spain is how the 
relationship between the United 
States and . the controversial 
Spanish regime, which had its 
origins in the bitter and divisive 
civil war of the late 19305, should 
be defined. 

Jackson, who was chairman of 
the UCSD Academic Senate from 
1969 to 1971 and is the author of 
several books on Spanish history, 
last month testified before the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee against a proposed 
treaty of friendship and 

cooperation between Spain and 
the United States. 

According to Jackson, of the 
seven parts of the proposed 
treaty, six sections are related to 
non-military issues while one 
defines the military relationship 
between the Spain of King Juan 
Carlos Borbon and the US. 

Jackson told the committee in 
Washington, "I oppose the treaty 
text presently being considered, 
in large part because its military 
and civilian components are so 
lopsided. In theory bilateral 
milltary cooperation is only one 
of seven complementary 
agreements. In fact $800 million 
are devoted to military ex-
penditure and $35 million to 
educational and scientific aid." 

Executive Agreement 
He also said, "I have always 

favored cultural, educational and 
economic exchanges between the 
United States and Spain. I have 
always opposed the military 
agreements which date from 1953 
and which in updated fonn are to

be included as part of the general 
Treaty of Friendship and 
Cooperation. " 

Jackson told the Triton Times 
recently that the proposed treaty 
is "substantially the same" as 
the executive agreement between 
Franco's and the United

States first made in 1953 and 
renewed every five years since 
then. 

" After Franco died, Ford and 
Kissinger decided it was time to 
make a treaty with Spain - and in 
Spain, there was also the desire 
to conclude a treaty," said 
Jackson. 

The Senate's hearings are to 
decide whether the treaty should 
be ratified. An executive 
agreement-like the current pact 
between the United States and 
Spain-is made between the 
foreign state and the president 
directly and need not be con-
firmed by the Senate. Such 
agreements are generally 
regarded as less f>inding than 
treaties. 

According to Jackson, Sen. 
Dick Clark (D-Iowa) was in-
terested in getting the advice of 
academics who have studied 
Spain. In addition to Jackson, the 
Senate heard, among others, 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology professor William 
Watson, who was a visiting 
professor at UCSD four years 
ago. 

New Ideas 
Although Spain has its 

problems, Jackson said that 
there can be a peaceful transition 
to a democratic regime. He 
contended that there has been 
tremendous economic growth in 
recent years, leading to the 
development of a stronger middle 
class and a class of well-paid 
factory workers who have 

something to lose if violence 
erupts. 

Jackson also believes that 
Spaniards are more sophisticated 
than ever because of the millions 
of tourists who have visited the 
country and the thousands of 
Spaniards who have worked in 
the democracies of Western 
Europe bringing home new ideas. 
He feels these Spaniards, along 
with those who remember the 
bloody civil war, will work hard 
to accomplish peaceful change. 

He said there is always the 
danger the ruling class will not be 
willing to accept change, pointing 
to the civil war as an example. 

Honest elections for a new 
Cortes (legislature) to write a 
new Constitution would be the 
best way to accomplish change, 
argues Jackson. 

He said that if the elections 
were held today it is very 
probable that the results by 
political party, would be: Social 
Democrats, one-quarter to one-
third; Christian Democrats, one-
quarter to one-third; Com-
munists, 10 - 15 percent; and the 
Spanish right (Falangists in-
cl uded), 10 to 15 percent. 

Jackson said the new Cortes

In response to swelling costs of 
operating university housing, 
Chancellor McElroy has set up a 
diverse high-level committee to 
study the long-range prospects of 
UC San Diego's housing program. 

Frost stressed that the com-
mittee will approach the problem 
"with a completely open mind," 
willing to consider many varied 
and perhaps seemingly drastic 
metbods to reduce costs on a long 
run basis.

The Women's Bank of San Diego 
opened its doors for business 
Wednesday with the hope of being 
"a bank where the worth and 
potential of men and women are 
recognized equally," according to 
Rita Mills McCoy, president. 

The bank was incorporated in 
March of 1975 by a small group of 
San Diego men and women. The 
Women's Bank opened witb $1.5 
million in capital, which was 
raised from the sale of stock. 

Over 700 of the 1130 share holders 
attended Share Holders Day at the 
bank last Saturday, which was 
open to accept new charter ac-
counts. 

McCoy stresses that "the 
Women's Bank is not just a bank 
for women. We will provide a full 
range of services for all people and 
business... adding the individual 
consideration and attention which 
will be our trademark." 

The emphasis of the bank, said 
McCoy, will be on bringing San 
Diego's female population, 
representing 48 percent of the 
city's population and 36 percent of 
its work force, into the mainstream 
of economic life. 

In addition to nonnal banking 
services, The Women's Bank offers 
special services, including free 

'- bank-by-mail, extended banking 
hours and a continuing educational 
program that will cover a variety 
of subjects.

The educational programs will 

be offered in a lecture series 
continuing over a five-week period. 
AU-day lectures and seminars will 
educate customers in field~ 
ranginl from managing and in-
vestin, their money to car buying. 
The series will aIIo include a 
course caUed "IRS and the MS."

people under stress following

Is There Life After College?--
Symposium Considers Options 

by Craig Jackson 
Staff writer 

. A four-day symposium asking the question "Is There Life After 
College?" is planned this week by the Career Planning and Placement 
and the Fourth College alumni. 

The symposium will consist of a series of speeches, discussions and 
seminars focusing on the problems of underemployment, deciding on a 
career, and choosing a lifestyle. 

The symposium will begin tonight at 7:30 with a presentation by Dr. 
James O'Toole of the University of Southern California Center for 
Futures Research on " Disparities Between the World of Education and 
the World of Work." O'Toole, a national expert in the field of work and 
education, will give some forecasts on the social and political con-
sequences of underemployment. 

Graduates Return 
Wednesday night, six UCSD graduates will describe what happened to 

them after they left college and entered the world of work. ~e alumni 
will discuss six areas: teaching, self-employment, and the value of 
degrees in natural science, physical science, social science and 
humanities/fine arts. 

After a preliminary presentation from 6:00 to 7:30, students will have 
the opportunity to meet in small groups with the six returning graduates 
and question them on their experiences. The serllinars will be held from 
7:30 to 8:30 and again from 8:30 to 9:30, thus allowing each student to sit 
in on at least two career discussions. 

Tomorrow evening at 7:30 there will be three featured speakers 
representing business (TRW Systems) , education (UC San Diego em-
ployment) aDd the govenunent (civil service ). They will talk about 
jobseeking strategies for their respective . I 

The symposium will end Thursday night at 7: 30 with a panel discussion 
on "Lifestyle Perspectives: Singles and Working Couples." Among the 
participants wtll be Harvey and Sylvia Selventen, each of whom oR 
part-time and rear their children part-time. The discussion will focus on 
the relation between career choice and interpenonal re&ationships. 

The meetinp on Monday, Tuesday and 'I1IInIday will take place in the 
! ourth Colle&e cafeteria; the meetq with the gradutes on Wednaday

STIJDENT COMMITIEE 
AGAINST RIPOFFS 

Restaurant . Ratings Rebuked 
As a resident of San Diego County and paricularly as a medical student 

specifically concerned with public health measures, I have consistently 
pointed out to visitors with pride the San Diego County Department of 
Public Health's commendable inspection program of all public food 
handlers. 

The department grants each restauranteur the " A" - "C" ratings which 
must be conspicuously displayed by every food handler in the county. 
This rating code is intended to serve as an assurance to the consumer of 
proper sanitation and of concern for his well-being in the preparation of 
his meal. 

I was shocked and saddened (not to mention shaken) by recently 
having been served a drink at the Plank house (a steak house near my 
Clairemont home which has an "A" rating) that included a surprise 
bonus- a large piece of glass which I bit down upon. This incident has 
forced me to carefully reconsider my pride and good faith in the depart-
ment's inspections . . J cannot overstate my support for such a program of 
health and safety inspections. 

I appreciate the enonnity of the task faced by the department in light of 
a limited budget, but I would hope that greater public input and increased 
diligence by the department can prevent others from suffering such 
avoidable and potentially serious mishaps, The inspection program is a 
vital service needed by all San Diegans, but it apparently requires some 
revision before we can all point with pride to our favorite restaurant's 
" A" rating. 

LARRY ZWEBEN 
UCSD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE The farm labor act insured free and secret elections for farm workers 

to select a union-either the UFW or the Teamsters-to represent them. 
The ALRB arbitrated charges of unfair labor practices and supervised 
and certified the union elections. 

The board represented a major effort to protect the rights of farm 
workers to choose the union of their choice to represent them. 

SCAR Chapter to Form Here 
And it succeeded, to a surprising degree. The ALRB has decided 327 

elections thus far, with the UFW winning 204 of them. More importantly, 
it brought a halt to the strike-boycotts that divided California agriculture 
in the sixties and early seventies. 

And now the ALRB is in jeopardy, because there was more need for it 
than legislators had expected. The board 's initial funding was exhausted-
-months before its first year ended-because of the overwhelming and 
unexpected number of elections needed. 

Because of this, a handful of state Senators, primarily Republicans and 
rural Democrats, have taken it upon themselves to block further funding 
for the board, which ret ,uIres a two-thirds vote by the Senate. 

The same legislators have also tried to take the board's administrative 
powers from it by ametd~g it in the state Senate finance committee. 

Faced with the possihllity of a reversion to the pre-ALRM situation, the 
UFW has decided, as Cesar Chavez has said, " to hypass the pOliticians in 
Sacra mento and go din'Ctly to the peop1e 

The UFW is circula .lng- petitions to place on a Novem~t Lallot an 
initiative to guarantef' funding for the board, allow union organizers

The National Student Coalition 

Against Racism (SCAR) was 
founded in February 1975 to sup-
port school desegregation and to 
protest racist attacks in Boston. 
There are over 70 individual SCAR 
chapters on college campuses 
across the country. SCAR is a 
multi-racial organization 
dedicated to the defense of third 
world people everywhere. It has 
consistently s upported school 
desegregation, protested 
educational cutbacks, and come to 
the aid of wrongfully accused 
chicanos and blacks such as 
Joanne Little. 

The focal point in the struggle for 
black rights is no longer the deep 
South, but the " Cradle of Liberty," 
Boston, Mass. Racists attacks in 
Boston have taken on an aspect 
that makes the Jim Crow South 
look rather tame by comparison. 
Blacks in Boston have had their 
homes attacked, their lives 
threatened and their children 
beaten by organized gangs of 
racist thugs. Similar treatment 
awaits any white who speaks out 
against these attacks. Last Feb. 15, 
over 1000 raci ts attacked police, 

injuring 70. These attacks were 
coordinated by racist squads ar-
med with mace and tear gas, and 
equipped with walkie-talkies and 
CB raffios. 

The organization condoning, if 
not initiating these activities calls 
itself ROAR (Restore Our 
Alienated Rights), of which many 
city officials are members. ROAR 
attempts to make itself respec-
table by advocating "neighborhood 
schools" and "quality education". 
If we judge by their actions, in-
stead of their rhetoric, their true 
racist motivations shine through. 
ROAR openly works with the John 
Birch SOCiety and the Ku Klux 
Klan. The ROAR symbol, an Irish 
shamrock on an Italian tricolor, 
clearly shows that they are not 
interested in neighborhood schools, 
but on dividing people on the basis 
of race a nd nationality. 

The issue in Boston is not neigh-
borhood schools, the issue is 
racism. Fewer students are bussed 
to school today than before. Judge 
Arthur Garrity ruled that the 
Boston school committee was 
"consciolL'lly maintaining a system 
of segr gat schools. " Black 
students us d to be bussed past 

neighborhood schools into inferior 
schools. White students were 
bussed past neighborhood schools 
into superior "whites only" 
schools. No one complained about 
busing then . No one wanted 
" neighborhood schools" then. 
Today, not a single white student of 
high school age is bussed to 
achieve desegregation . Only 
blacks are bussed. 

For us in San Diego, Boston may 
seem so far a way that events there 
do not relate to us. Attitudes like 
this are a source of encouragement 
to racists everywhere. If the 
Boston racists continue their 
violence unopposed , racists 
throughout the country will be 
tempted to do the same. 

We cannot expect politicians in 
this election year to defend the 
black students in Boston if they see 
no support for such a defense. 
Those candidates running on " law 
and order" platforms seem to have 
forgotten that desegregation is the 
law and that it is not the blacks, but 
a few violent whites who are the 
criminals. 

On April 20, SCAR is calling for 
an organizational meeting to map

Politics: James G. Soto 
, 

Muddlinq Throuqh 
Politics is often discussed over cocktails. (In some circles the cocktails 

are replact;d by some sort of illicit drug, but the effect is the same.) 
Actually, over cocktails politics are decided more than discussed. 

How many manhattans and martinis have eavesdropped on discussions 
of state remains a mystery to those of us in the fourth estate, but if it is 
anywhere near the number of political discussions engaged in by jour-
nalistic hacks at any number of saloons on any particular day, the 
number is phenomenal. 

If, in fact, I had some god-like power to create a more perfect world, I 
might comb the inns of our time in search of the political messiah who 
will sweep away the pressing prohlems of tbe period. 

Too often, the sages of state are preoccupied with protocol, and would 
not think of tapping the rich river of imagination that runs through some 
of our drinking establishments. 

On that rare occasion when I have found myself sipping a very weak 
drink in the most respectable- of course-bistro, I have been possessed 
by that most dangerous of maladies- Potomac fever. 

This ailment has long plagued the United States. In fact , it has long 
plagued me and my cronies. More often than not, our waking hours are 
spent idly thinking of making that grand speech on the floor of the House, 
The ideas proposed during such reveries would amaze the spirits of other 
such idle dreamer&' as Plato, Mill and Marx. But alas, they remain 
reveries. 

AoyOtberJoe 
But I must make my pronouncement to the world of Washington ; " I am 

ready to accept any cabinet post atany time and I will accept a 10 percent 
cut in salary to steal thei.0b away from any other Joe." 

However, it will be my personal policy not to wait up late at night for a 
phone call from Carter, Brown, Ford or Reagan. 

At any rate, the madness Inflicted by Potomac fever has become 
especially rampant in the halls <I Capitol Hill. Some of the old codgers 
who make their living there have long suffered from the ramblings 
associated. with that dread disease. The congressional chamber, not 
usually recognized as a repository of fresh air, has become in recent 
years a monument to stale air and outrageous corruption. 

While the pork-barreling continues at a frenzied pace, the casual 0b-
server perched in a cocktail lounge becomes anesthetized to this sort of 
thing. It has neared the status of a tUn.hooored tradition. 

However, more than one Mai-tai bas heard the anger of those who have 
become infuriated over the madness <I campaign financing. 

The members of Congress, most of whom have latent desires to move to 
the White House, passed a bill that would set up a system of matching, 

dollar-for~Uar, the funds raised for that breed of rodent known as the

greatly increased electoral financing. 

Scandalous 
Early last week a report s released showing every candidate, save

Housing . . 
Ford and Jackson, wallowing in debt. In the space of a few months, the 
top three Democratic candidates have spent more than $15 million. 

Figures from the profligate Wallace campaign are not yet in, but it will 
certainly inflate the above figure even more. 

As more than one observer has noted, there are over 20 primaries to go, 
along with an expensive convention process and an even more costly 
general election. The major growth industry in the American economy 
would appear to be E lectioneering. 

throughout the school, since 
complexes could offer diverse 
service packages. Under this 
system, students would be housed 
according to their preference as to 
location, building and service 
package offered: 

"Scandalous," I might exclaim, iC I didn't have thoseÂ· secret desires 
myself to go out on the campaign trail. . 

Congress in its fever has gone mad like some debutante who has just 
received a charge card for Nieman-Marcus and feels she must break her 
daddy tonight. Arguing over nothing very important and quickly passing 
over the substantial issues, our legislators have not seen fit to quietly die 
orttJe malady. They must infect the nation. 

Buildings offering a Cull range of 
services might appeal to some 
students, while others might prefer 
less service at a lower price. 

Potomac fever is raging out of control. Hundreds of madpersons are 
possessed by its grip and billboards have sprouted up over the land 
proclaiming the superiority of a Mo, Scoop or Ron. 

Muddling through, will the Americans finally take my advice and pass 
that proposed constitutional amendment making the cocktail hour the 
time when all political decisions are made? 

Barrett said this system could 
cut costs by $250,000 a year, 
although it is up the the committee 
to decide whether these savings 
would justify the dissolution of the 
present "small college" 
arrangement of the dorms.

Concert Scene 

Trower, Corea Top Weekend Bill 
Robin Trower, one of England's premier guitarists, spearheads a 

concert at the Sports Arena April 23. 
Trower, formerly of Procol Harum, is rapidly ascending the ladder 

of superstardom. His guitar work forms the core of the Robin Trower 
Band, which also features bassist-vocalist James Dewar and drwn-
mer Reg Isadore. 

His latest LP "Robin Trower Live" contains material from his three 
previous releases, "Twice Removed From Yesterday," "Bridge of 
Sighs" and "For Earth Below." 

Trower states that "live playing is my medium. I enjoy playing my 
music in front of an audience more than anything else. What I want to 
do is to be able to carry that feeling into a studio and just jam, have a 
good blow, and capture it on record. " 

Appearing witb the Robin Trower Band will be Status Quo. 
Return to Forever featuring Chick Corea will be appearing April 24 

at Golden Hall. Corea's reknowned keyboard abilities highlight the 
band's performance. Supporting him will be bassist extraordinaire 
Stanley Clarke, guitarist AI Dimeola and drummer Lenny White. 

Robin Trower 

Other concerts slated for the upcoming weekend are Savoy Brown 
and the <llambers Brothers at Golden Â·Ha11 April 25 and the Elvis 
Presley show at the Sports Arena April 24. 

Noon Concert 

Grace: A Local Band Puts Stress On 
Logical, Melodic Continuity 

I 
by Ted Navin Burke 

Normally, if a city spawns a number of bands with 
inclinations towards original material rather than the 
latest Top Forty mongering, it would be considered 
an indication of that community's personality. San 
Diego, though, has no personality inherent save for 
the general rootlessness born of transient proclivity. 
The creative musiCian, with little substance from the 
environs to feed from, must .ito outside the city's and 
occassionally the country's perimeters for in-
spiritional reference points. 

It becomes a matter of how well a group adopts a 
motif. Horsefeathers go for a Move-King Crimson-
ELO synthesis, Harlequin vie for Gentle Giant, Yes 
and Genesis (with smidgins of Deep Purple thrown in 
due to Rick Hilton's laser beam guitar work), and the 
Trix Band, now United States Monsters, seek to fuse 
the New York Dolls, early Kinks, and Blue Oyster 
Cult for the ultimate heavy metal noise. Eacb of these 
hands succeed to varying degrees. 

Grace, the band that gave the noon concert last 
Wednesday on Muir Commons also has this general 
derivation of style. Unlike the others, however, they 
have mastered the form and produced material that 
is almost the equal of their influences. Even though 
stylizations have been taken from Chick Corea, Yes, 
Gentle Giant, and others, Grace's material takes on 
an identity of its own. More than any other local band, 
their compositions place unconunon stress on logical, 
melodic continuity. 

Grace's intricate style avoids abrupt, intruding 
time changes, preferring instead subtle changes from 
passage to passage, rich hannonic interplay between 
rhythm section and soloist, and a use of repetition 
that precludes redundancy. Coupled with this is the 
band's seemingly unerring sense of knowing when to 
quit. A piece of music goes through its predestined 
and invigorating motions until a symmetrically 
correct conclusion is reached. Nothing is belabored, 
and no amount of riffing overstays its welcome. 

Comprising the band is Bob Schwartz on guitars, 
his brother Danny on bass, Paul Hilker on keyboards, 
Randy Brinton on violin, and John D'Agostino on 
percussion. Like Return to Forever, Grace demon-
strates a sixth sense in communicating its ideas to 
each other. The lead guitar work, though not "hot" in . 
the arbitrarily set criteria of speed, displayed a 
brilliantly rich tone and evocative phrasing, em-
phasizing golden sustains and tonal nuance over 
rapid fire note clumps. There was melancholic 
texturing from the violin, to which the keyboard 
would hammer out light fingered fills and variation 
finding patterns, while the bass and drums would 
probe for complementing off beats and cOntrapuntal 
surges. The same discipline would be maintained no 
matter who the soloist was. 

There are grounds for criticism, though. The 
singing, though strong, lacked a certain assuredness 
that makes an audience f~l welcome, and what

"Little Foxes" at Center Stage 
Pits Old South Against New 

by Alao Russell 
Arts Editor 

Opening night. 
Whether it be a high school or 

Broadway performance, there is 
always something exciting about 
that initial play. Last Tuesday's 
opening of Lillian Hellman's "The 
Little Foxes" at the Carter Centre 
Stage in Balboa Park was no ex-
ception. 

The last of ten plays featured in 
the Globe's American Bicentennial 
Season, "The Little Foxes" five-
week run culminates a season that 
has seen more than 100,000 people 
attend performances. 

The play centers around a family 
conflict between two brothers and 
a sister. Set in a small southern 
town at the turn of the century, 
" Little Foxes" has an underlying 
theme of " old" south versus 
" new," with the family opting for 
money over "white gentility," a 
factory instead of mint juleps. 

With the family consumed by a 
power struggle knowing no bound'!, 
blood seems about as thick as paint 
thinner ; the only thing keeping the 
family together is the fear of 
outsiders moving in and getting a 
" piece of the action. it Between the 

. family and inlaws there is physical 
abuse, mental cruelty , and finally 
murder-in a sense. The last act 
shows the extent to which a 
member of the family would go to 
gain power. 

The first act started slowly, with 
the performers unsure of their 
lines. However, after several 
minutes, the actors seemed to gain 
control of their movements and 
timing. By the third act everything 
was well under control. 

Two ex.cellent performances 
were delivered, one by Nina 
Midlam, the other by Jennifer 
Henn. Midlam, playing the part of 
Birdie Hubbard, a whimsical,. 
semi-alcoholic bubblehead, gave 
believability to this sad person's 
character and her nostalgic 
longing for lost happiness. 

Henn dominated the play as 

Regina Giddens. impressive in her 
statuesque " iceberg" pose and 
manner. Through Regina , 
playwright Hellman proves that 
the female is the more deadly of 
the species. Regina will not allow 
herself to be stopped in her pursuit 
to become something. 

Also doing a good job in their 
small roles as servants were 
Veronica K. Henson and Leonard 
C. Lightfoot. Henson was - solid 
throughout in her role of Addie, the 
faithful and knowing maid. 
Lightfoot delivered comic lines 
which helped to alleviate the 
heaviness ofthe play. 

For those who haven't been to 
the Carter Centre Stage, it's a 
beautiful little theatre in which 
every member of the audience has 
a good view of the stage. The 
theatre consists of four large rows 
situated in a four section rectangle 
around the stage. The sets are 
simple but effective, with the 
audience right on top of the per-
formance. 

College students should avail 
themselves of the opportunity to 
attend a performance. Tickets are 
only $2.75 with student ID, except 
for Frida~ and Saturday plays. 
Tickets should be purchased well 
in advance, as many performances 
are sold out. 

In these days when movies often 
cost four dollars, plays at Balboa 
Park are certainly worth the 
money.

McCoy was one of the few bankers

came to San Diego. 

The Women's Bank also allows 
YOWlg people to open accoWlts 
without a parent's signature,

Also planned for the near future 
is a reception for high school and

familiarize the youth conununity 
with the services of the bank. 

Another special feature at the 
bank is a 6' by 6' "playpit," created 
by La Jolla designer Jain Malkin, 
which is intended to allow people 
with small children to visit the 
bank more conveniently. 

According to McCoy, "The 
Women's Bank is a non-

services to men and women alike, 
encouraging the economic par-

the music's complexity sounded 
like rejects from Yes singer Jon 
Anderson's. Also lacking was 
significant stage presence. A 
musician hiding behind his in-
strument like a scared insect has 
an appeal, but the world doesn't 
need a band full of progressive 
Leonard Cohens.

But that's nit picking. Grace 
shows a potential to grow far 
beyond where they are now. The 
musicianship is first rate, the 
composing and arranging superb, 
and the band seems willing to try 
new things. Grace's potential, if 
audience tastes allow, appears 
stratospheric.

Sports: They Come and Go 
by Phil Hubbard 

Intercollegiate sports have 
beeri born, died out, and been 
resurrected rather frequently at 
UCSD in past years, and 1976 
seems to be continuing the 
tradition. 

Winter quarter marked the 
return of track to the campus 
after an absence of several years, 
but also witnessed the demise of 
wrestling. In addition, at least 
two new women's teams, soccer 
and crew, have begWl com-
petition this season. 

Sports generally disappear 
here from a lack of student 
participation. The wrestling 
team, however, was helped along 
by a number of external cir-
cwnstances. 

" A couple of years ago San 
Diego State, Point Loma, and 
USIU all dropped wrestling, " 
explained Pat Pinkerton, the 
team's former coach. "We were 
the only school left in the area 
and the nearest competition was 
a hundred miles away." 

Pinkerton, who originally came 
to this state from Colorado to 
wrestle steers in rodeos, joined 
the UC8D grounds department in 
1969 and assisted Chuck 
Millenbah with a squad that 
season. The following year he 
took over as head coach. 

The grapplers were fairly 
successful during the next few 
seasons. In 1973 they won the Cal 
Tech Tournament for the fifth 
year in a row. After that season, 
though, things started going 

Special Report 
attendance at practices fell . This, 
coupled with some eligibility 
problems caused Pinkerton and 
athletic director Judy Sweet to 
cancel the remaiuder of the 
season. 

"We're on a very tight budget," 
Sweet explained. " As a team 
dwindles in participation, the 
money goes elsewhere and the 
sport is dropped. " 

Pinkerton hopes the interest 
will revive, however, and is 
willing to coach next year "if we 
can get enough bodies." 

Demonstrating that a sport can 
return after being dropped for 
awhile, the track squad resumed 
competition this winter after an 
absence of several seasons. 

"Some students expressed 
interest, so we thought we'd try 
it again," said the team's coach, 
Andy Skief. 22 men checked out 
equipment, from which he ,hopes 
to build an active team of 12 or so. 

With such a small group, it was 
decided not to schedule any dual 
meets this season. In triangular 
meets and relays, he explained, 
the size of the team isn' t as 
crucial. "We're missing a few 
events," he conceded. As a result 
the squad would have to "give 
away" so many points that it 
would be difficult to make a good 
showing against a solitary op-
ponent. 

And with a return of track, 
women's crew and soccer have 

Golf's Pat Patrick (TT 
photo: Nathan Meyers) 

Many of them are neighborhood 
teams started by women who had 
children playing in the youth 
leagues, and some are sponsored 
by commercial businesses. There 
are no other colleges represented 
at present. 

The women's crew had its first 
taste of competition in the San 
Diego Crew Classic _ April 3. 
Jack Vallarga, who had coached 
a women's national high school 
champion boat before taking over 
the men's team here, began 
training the men and women 
together early this fall . 

" We ran mixed boats during 
the first half of the year," he said. 
"That's kind of a radical ap-
proach for crew." He added that 
this technique seems to be 
working weB, though. 

At present, the women's crew 
has only eight or nine rowers and 
a few coxswains, so they are 
limited to one boat. Vallarga 
hopes to expand in the future, 
however. Ideally, he wants boats 
in the light, heavy, open, and 
frash classes. 

Finding funds for ' these new 
athletic teams is usually a dif-
ficult task, but government 
legislation provided a shot in the 
arm for this year's newcomers. 
"With women's sports we can get 
money through Title IX to sup-
port these types of activities," 
explained Sweet. 

Track's Andy Skeif (TT photo : Sharon Roberts) 
Even money and student In-

terest, though, are not sufficient 
to get a team started. Naturally, 
a coach must be found 
somewhere. Ideally, they come 
from the existing physical 
education staff on a volunteer 
basis, however many are hired 
part time for the position from 
other departments or from the 
outside. 

downhill . Following the Cal Tech 
Tournament this January, the 
remnants of the team officially 
disbanded. 

The final dissolution was ac-
celerated by a District In NAIA 
ruling last November which 
required a wrestler to participate 
in at least three coftference 
matches in order to be eligible for 
the post-season championship 
meets. As the other schools in the 
conference were well to the 
north, and the team was on a 
tight budget , the required 
number of matches could not be 
scheduled. 

With the wrestlers now 
deprived of the opportunity to 
compete in the championships,

already begun their initial season 
of competition and a women's 
softball team is plarmed for later 
in the spring. 

nan Rothmuller, who coached 
men's soccer here until three 
years ago and is scheduled to 
return to that post next fall, has 
directed the women 's team 
through the first half of its 
season. Although winless, the 
squad has three ties to its credit 
and the coach seems pleased with 
the players' progress. 

"Most of them had never 
played before," he said, " but 
they seem to be picking it up 
quickly." 

The group plays in a YMCA 
league with 10 or so other teams. 

Due to the school's low-key 
attitude towa rd competitive 
athletics, finding a coach can 
often prove difficult. The coach 
must understand that academics 
comes first and that class 
scheduling often makes regular 
daily practice impossible. 

" It 's kind of frustrating for 
them," Sweet conceded. "You 
have to be kind of a unique person 
to handle it. ..

Memories Are 
Gone 

My fondest memories of little 
league baseball come in loud and 
clear: the parents arguing in the 
stands, striking out to lose a game, 
getting hit in the ribs by a thrown 
ball and immediately throwing 
up ... 

I also recall the inevitable home 
plate umpire, always in need of a 
shave, about 6 foot a, fat, gruff 
voice, and for some reason never ' 
happy. 

With the help of two UC San 
Diego women, that final memory 
may never be quite the same. 
Kathy McMillen and Geral Nordin 
have become little league umps. 

Two months ago the pair worked 
a UCSD practice game, then went 
on to Bob Moss' umpiring clinic. 

According to Moss, "They both 
were excellent. They didn't have a 
great amoWlt of experience, but 
they were interested and did a good 
job." 

Dave Eisen 

Just two weeks ago McMillen 
and Nordin did their fiI'st games 
for University City Little League, 
and have worked behind the plate 
as well as the bases. 

Geral Nordin, above, and 
Kathy McM illen are U .C . 
Little League ' s newest 
umpires. (TT photos: Bill 
Brooks ) 

" Of the two, McMillen has a litle more confidence because she has 
previously umpired intramural basketball and softball. Nordin keeps 
very good control of the game though, and she's really into umpiring, " 
Moss analyzed. 

I just don 't think that "Steeeerike" will ever sound the way it did in the 
old days ... 

Coming off an easy three-straIght-game win over UC Riverside, the 
Triton men 's volleyball team hosts an eight team field Saturday in their 
League Tournament. 

There will be three UC's (UCSD, UCR, UC Irvine), two Cal Poly's (San 
Luis Obispo and Pomona ) and three Cal State 's (Northridge, Fullerton, 
Dominguez Hills ) scheduled to perform in the main gym from 9 am to 10 
pm. 

For the'Tritons, it will be the last home appearance of the season, as 
well as Jeff Gorrell's last home coaching match. 

Though some momentum will be there, in the form of an easy victory 
Friday night (see Wednesday's TT), the competition will be tough, and 
the spectators should be treated to some high-quality, as well as free , 
volleyball action ... 

Later this year, Dave Horwitt could become the first UCSD student to 
be seeded first , in anything or anywhere, all season. 

The sophomore will be headed to the All-Cal handball tournament at 
Berkeley, and will probably be rated first in the pre-tourney pick~s.

Jackson ... 
would decide between either a 
Republic or a Constitutional 
monarchy on the model of 
Belgium (with slighUy stronger 
powers than the Scandanavian 
and British monarchs have). 

Jackson said the question of 
whether Juan Carlos Borbon 
should be king should rest with 
the Spanish people. 

Even among many monar-
dusts, Juan Carlos is not ac-
ceptable (there are the Carlists 
and partisans for Juan Carlos' 
father, who opposed the in-
vestiture of royal power on Juan 
Carlos). Also. Jackson said the 
real power is concentrated in the 
hands of some of Franco's old 
cronies who occupy the im-
portant ministries. 

SUlll500 PoliUcal Prisoners 
" Personally. I would like to see 

Spain become a democratic 
country - and the chances are 
good with economic aid and 
cooperation," said Jackson. He 
said military aid would probably 
corrupt the government like it 
has wherever American military 
a ssistance has gone (citing 
Korea. and Taiwan as exam-
ples).

Jackson said the economic 
slowdown that hit Spain in late 
1974 (because of the oil crisis) has 
made economic aid necessary in 
order to help maintain good 
conditions for democracy . 

Political freedoms -especially 
freedoms for the press- have 
increased slighUy in the last two 
years, according to Jackson. 
However. he said there are still 
1500 political prisoners and the 
real test for Juan Carlos will be 
whether he declares political 
amnesty. Until then he said any 
changes are merely cosmetic. 

As an example of the relaxing 
press control in Spain. Jackson 
pointed to Historia IDtemacional, 
a magazine which recently 
printed its first article by 
Jackson on a subject other than 
Medieval history, although he 
has published three books on the 
Spanish Civil War-his special 
field of study. 

However, Jackson said the 
editor of the magazine was 
recently mugged by Spanish 
Rightists for his views. He said 
that the only thing encouraging 
about this incident was that it 
was published in the Spanish 

Horwitt was dropped in the 1975 finals by Berkeley's John Wong, who 
has since moved on. This year Horwitt expects some of his competition 
from others at Berkeley and UCLA. 

Coach John Cates is holding-team try-outs to see which three players. 
other than Horwitt, will make the trip in the middle of May. 

In the pros: San Diego's World Team Tennis Friars open up with an 

newsmagazine Camblo 16, while 
in the Franco days the incident 
would have been hushed up. 

Republican emigres still must 
take their chances if they return 
to Spain but most non-
Communists may come back 
freely. However, Jackson said 
the government is trying so far 
unsuccessfully to isolate the 
Communists . from the other 
political opponents. 

Mainstays of ReacUon 

Economically , Jackson 
believes the Spaniards are better t 
off than the Portuguese. before 
Portugal began its political 
turmoil. He said the Spanish 
army does not want to govern 
Spain and will be less of a factor 
than the Portuguese army has 
been in recent months. 

Jackson said that one of the 
most encouraging aspects of the 
Spanish political scene is the 
attitude of the Catholic church. 
which has become far more 
liberalized in recent years than 
the rest of Spain's ruling elite.

He said t:le church has become 
sympathetic to the separatist 
movements and the growing 
trade-union movement. 

The separatist question still 
continues to plague Spain (note 
the recent violence in the Basque 
country and the increased 
agitation in Catalonia). Jackson 
said that the problem can be at 
least temporarily defused if those 
regions were granted autonomy 
similiar to that enjoyed under the 
Republic in the 19305. This would 
probably co-op the terrorists, 
Jackson believes. 

Jackson said that the Foreign 
Relations Committee is generally 
favorable to the proposed treaty. 
Chairman John Sparkman (0 -
Alabama ) wondered why 
hearings were being held at all. 
Sen . Clifford Case (R-New 
Jersey) was aware of the 
problems, according to Jackson. 
but has probably already made 
up his mind on the matter.

Headed by Rod Laver and not much more. the Friars recently sent last 

season's star, Vijay Amritraj, to the Strings, in a deal that few will un-
derstand. Possibly the answer lies in the fact that both teams have, or 
have had for most of the Friars year-and-a-half in existence, the same 
general manager, Bart Christianson. 

So much for credibility ...
