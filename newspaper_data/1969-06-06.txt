a farewell to the 68·69 ACADE~IC school year 

by Steve Landau 
The school year is quickly coming to 

a close now, and as we look back over 
the year we realize what an amazing year 
it was, especially those of us who can 
contrast it with the relatively peaceful 
years of UCSD past. It was a year 
in which a steady stream of issues kept 
the administration worried, the local com-
munity uptight, the committed students 
busy, and the uncommitted in a constant 
quandry. 

This was a year in which such issues 
as military recruitment, minority studies, 
and protest demonstrations became no 
longer a spectacle to be witnessed on 
the evening news as something that hap-
pened at the megaversity but never at 
UCSD, but a real experience to be ob-
served firsthand. 

It could be said that UCSD's issues 
generally followed the national trends; 
some ot the same cliclles were heard. 
However, undoubtedly most issues were 
given a :;pecial UCSD twist. If anything, 
the Lum(\mba- Zapata struggle has shown 
UCSD students the tremQndous opportuni-
ties for relevance embodied in the twelv2-
college plan, where an acade1nic master 
plan that wUl develop as the college 
grows allows innovatlon that would not 
normally be possible. 

We have al$o seen that ~cause UCSD 
is at e. sta~ in which it is not solidified 
and set in its ways, it is possible to 
effect its future course. We have seen 
that it is not inevitable that UCSD will 
follow the well trodden path of other 
American universities. The athletic con-
troversy was characteristic oHbis attempt 

to ~hart a different course than normalr.v 
While other campuses haggle over wne: 

ther ROTC should receive credit, or 
whether it should even be on-campus, 
UCSD has reacoed the point where the 
very presence of even a recruiter for 
the armed forces appearing on campus 
has been challenged. The university com-
munity has polarized over this issue, 
but it cannot be denied by either side 
that the eight students in their defense 
succeeded in raising issues that have 
not been given serious enough considera-
tion in the part, and are crucial to the 
university. 

As this campus followed the escalating 
pattern of confrontations that led, among 
other things, to the first take-over of 
a building on campus, Chancellor McGill 
and Provost Saltman seemed greatly dis-
tressed that their romantic ideal of the 
"community of scholars' had broken 
down. 

However, what appears to have happened 
is that so many issues came to light 
about which so little had been done in 
the past, or at least been cOlnmunicated 
to the students, that the res ult was in-
evitable. If anything. the year was one 
of beginning the tortuous problem ot really 
coming to grips with essential problems, 
and if the stud nts pushed too hard, it 
must be said that a eertain degree of 
pressure ,,<as necessary as a catalyst to 
a somewhat ~eluctant ~ministration. 

In a special section inside the news staff 
of the Triton limes presents a roundup 
of the major news ltealS ot the year, 
attemptini to cover the highlights and 
present some interpretation of their im-
portance.

Mc~r.Positio~ During 
t) eso Strike Challenged 

Ulst quarter, the '!'riton Times Editorial Board 
backed up Chancellor McGill for the most part in 
his handling of the Marcuse matter. It was felt 
at that time that the Chancellor, although not taking 
as hard a line as we would have liked seem him 
take, handled the matter in what perhaps might have 
been the best manner possible, given the circum-
stances. It was also felt that the Chancellor was 
coming unde r criticism at a time during which unity 
was essential and lack of such proved dangerously 
divisive. 

However, in line with our genera!'Policyofgiving 
credit where credit is due and vice versa, regard-
less of who the individual or group happens to be, 
we must now express our extreme disappointment 
with the way in which Chancellor McGill handled 
himself during the recent student strike here. 
We strongly disagree with his opinions, as ex-
pressed at the Academic Senate meetings and 
afterwards. While there is not much that one can 
do if the Chancellor sincerely felt the way he 
did, we do take strong exception at the Chancellor 
expounding his opinions to the press in such a 
manner as to discredit the strikers and distort 
the circumstances of the strike at UCSD. 

Unfortunately, it would appear that McGill, having 
taken a beating in the local papers during the Mar-
cuse debacle, was trying to take as much advan-
tage as possible of an opportunity to get back in 
the public's good graces. Public·relations efforts 
are pragmatically necessary, and may in fact be 
beneficial to the university if they can be accom-
plished without compromising oneself. But it ap-
pears that whatever gains the Chancellor made 
with the public were achieved at the expense ot 
the many students who were sincerely trying to 
make their feelings known to the public. 

What specifically, do we take issue witlthat 
McGill said or did? First, when questioned by news-
men he repeatedly denied that there was a strike, 
or that attempts made to strike were at all effective. 
As a central purpose of the strike was to impress 
upon not only Reagan and the authorities but more 
importantly the general public, the sense of out-
rage felt by the university community, attempts to 
play down the strike undermined these efforts and 
caused the sacrifices of many persons to go for 
naught. 

Secondly, when the Academic Senate responded 
to the situation by asking their colleagues to devote 
Thursday and Friday to a discussion of the issues, 
a respnse which most students considered to be 
the minimal one, McGill called such action "irre-
sonsible'. Later, at a press conference, McGill 
termed such classroom discussions "the basest

form of indoctrination. " This is an incredible 
statement, especially for a.person who opened the 
convocation of Wednesday, Man 21, with a plea (or 
rational • 'discussion' . It also subtly displays a con-
siderable lack of confidence in the faculty members 
of whom he is the nominal leader. 

Hut what is perhaps more indicting than any of 
Mc Gill ' s negative r eactions dur ing the st rike per iod 
was a blatant sin of ommission on his part, namely 
his complete silence and refusal to amake any 
meaningful personal statement deploring the Berke-
ley violence. In failing to do so he failed not so much 
in his role as a Chancellor, but as private citizen 
Willlam McGill.' As one who is supposed to repre-
sent the entire Academic community his words 
could have carred considerabel import. We have 
always heard that Bill McGill is such a liberal, 
but his response to the whole situation actually 
ranged on the conservative side when compared 
to those of the the other UC Chancellors, some of 
whom went as far as supporting a boycott of classes 
or sending telegrams to authorities deploring the 
plice violence. 

During the Marcuse crisis the Chancellor asked 
us to trust him as the leader ofthe academic com-
munity. He told us that he was acting In our be-
half and pleaded with us not to undermine him. 
He said also that in the position of Chancellor, 
he essentially was obligated to express the con-
sensus of opinion of the entire community. It 
would seem, as shown by the fact that student 
support or sympathy for the strike was consider-
able, probably more than 60%, and that a resolution 
which he had condemned was approved by the Se-
nate, that he was not living up to this task. During 
the Marcuse affair, McGill asked us not to under-
mine him even if we didn't understand or agree 
with what he was doing in a specific situation. Why 
didn't you grant the same privilege to the students , 
Chancellor McGill? 

Finally, let us make it clear that this is not a 
call for the resignation of t'he Chancellor ,;not for 
his capitualtion to any list of demands. We rea lize 
that any such formal apologies as have been de-
manded would compromise his position beyound re-
pair with the outside community, giving fuel to 
Reagan and right-wingers who could claim that Mc-
Gill had "given in to the militants '. However, we 
do feel that a reconsideration and perhaps clarifi-
cation of his positon during the strike period might 
be worthwhile. At the least it is necessary that 
disapproval of his actions be expressed. In con-
clusion, we might pose one final question to the 
Chancellor: Was it in fact your refusal to take a 
stand that contributed to the "cycle of escalation" 
on this campus?

The opinions expressed 
in byl1ned articles do not

views of the TIMES. 

tj«e4t EeItttntat 
Chancellor Replies ••• 

The Triton Times has offered me an opportunity to comment on its 
critical editorial. I am very grateful both for the courtesy of the 
gesture and for the chance to state my own views on the UCSD 'strike' 
and the agony in which the University now finds itself. 

The Triton Times engages in a hazardous occupation in attempting 
to speculate on the motives governing the Chancellor's actions. The 
view tbat the Chancellor, having been attacked by powerful elements 
in San Diego for his earlier decision on Professor Marcuse, sought 
then to redre~~, his community position by opposing the strike, has 
elements of p. IIsibility. It is not, however, nearly as plausible as the 
correct analysis. The latter is that the Chancellor sought to maintain an 
entirely consistent position in both circumslances. I am charged with 
the primary r esponsibility for protecting UCSD from the waves of 
irrationality washing over every major campus in the country. Con-
sistent with that responsibility I opposed the San Diego newspapers 
and the American Legion when they sought to fire the Professor uni-
laterally. I understand what the students were feeling out. Consistent 
with my responsibiUty I had to oppose the strike as an intrusion on 
the freedoms and the rights of those students who wished to go to 
class. Consistency seems to require that in the long run the Chancellor 
must alienate almost every pressure center on campus, but I r ecog-
nized long ago that I am no candidate to win a popularity contest. 
The pressures of these times are too severe. 

I hope that the Triton Times is sensitive to the fact that a powerful 
radical leadership evidenced itself both in the organization of the 
strike and during the first campus convocation on Wednesday. March 
21. The Chancellor had to be deeply concerned about the second 
clause of "On strike, shut it down" because of the prejudice to the 
rights of those students who did not want the campus shut down. 
Furthermore, there was the lesson of evolution of such strikes under 
radical leadership at San FranCisco State and Berkeley, moving from 
non-violent pressure to violent disruption. The Chancellor felt that 
he must reflect the integrity of the educational community which he 
sees as tanding in a different domain from the political pressures 
of community at large. The Chancellor must and will resist every 
effort from any quarter to convert the University into a political 
instrument. 

The student body quickly disowned the radical leadership of the 
strike. Many students saw their own participation as a means to 
express their revulsion for the tragic events at Berkeley. The Chan-
cellor fully understood but questioned the use of a means that was 
likely to alienate the very people in the community that the students 
sought to reach. 

I ask the Triton Times whether during the entire affair any grr 
of students came to the Chancellor asking for his help and his lead! -
ship? The tact is that when the crisis arose on Tuesday, March 20, J 
was immediately confronted by a group of 60 people demanding th .• 
I send telegrams denouncing Chancellor Heyns, the Board of Regents, 
and the Governor. I would not do it. I could have done it and then 
called these various agencies asking them to ignore the telegram. 1 
am not, however, made that way. The fact is that for a week I seemed 
to proceed from on confrontation to another dealing always with anger 
and demands. 

Let me now say that the helicopter gassing of the Berkeley Campus 
was an irresponsible and almost barbarous act. The encouragement

What's so ~p-ecial about 
Beechwood Ageing? 

We mUst be bragging too much about 
Beechwood Ageing. 
Because we're starting to get some 
flak about it. Like, "Beechwood, 
Beechwood . .• big deal." Apd "If 

let Budweiser Cerment a second time.

to cling to, helping clarify 
the beer. And since these 
strips are also porous, they 
help absorb beer's natural 
"edge," giving Budweiser 
its finished taste. Or in other 
words, "a taste, a smooth-
ness and a drinkability you 
will find in no other beer at 
any price." 

they practically ran their way 
into the NAIA regional playoffs, 
which was an outstanding feat 
in Use If. The run, run, run 
offense was exciting to watCh, 
and the last minute victories pro-
vided many thr1lls. 

The wrestling team also did 
well, going undefeated at home. 
Talk about last minute victories, 
they had some too. 

One of the biggest highlights 
of the year was our volleyball 
team taking third in the NAIA 
national finals. It is something 
to really be proud of, and I 
believe it is just as important 
as the USC football team was 
to USC. 

But the main point that needs 
to be made is this--the athletic 
program did, in the school year 
1968-69, accomplished its pur-
pose. It provided real challenge 
to participants and gave teams 
the necessary coaching and 
equipment so that they could meet 
thls challenge and be able to 

' participate on even ground with 
opponents. ]t also provided fans 
with the kind of excitement and 
entertainment that is thrilling and 
enjoyable.

team made up of the UC cam-
puses. This team will tour 
Australia during 1970. In aoOl-
tion, it is possible that one or 
two other members, if of out-
standing ability, might be 
selected to make this interesting 
trip. 

On an individual basis, the Tri-
tons qualified one man for the 
nationals in track and fie Id. This 
is the outstanding record holde r 
in both the 100 yard dash and 
the long jump, Tom Wolfe. He 
will trayel to Billings, Montana. 
for the nationals and compete 
in the long jump. 

A presentation was made by all 
campuses of the University of 
the athlete of the year from each 
campus, during the half time of 
the UCLA- Berkeley basketball 
game. Phil Costello from UCSD 
received tbe award for his out-
standing participation on the 
wrestling team. It was noted 
that his grade point average was 
the highe st of the eight student 
athletes who were presented 
awards. 

other highlights of the sports 
year include participation by the 

. UCSD Tritons in thirteen of the 
fifteen All Cal events held during 
the school year. These events 
generally are considered the high 
point of the season and offer 
the opportunity for students to 
visit many of· the other UC cam-
puses. 

All student lockers in the Gym-
nasium must be cleared by 
Thursday, June 12. Personal 
items found in lockers after June 
12 wUl be discarded. All equip-
ment and clothing borrowed from 
the Department of Physical Edu-
cation must be returned ho the 
Equipment Issue Room by that 
date or reimbursement made to 
the department. 

The PE department also must 
be commended for the outstanding 
intramural program which they 
provided- for those students who 
had neither the time or the abi-
lity to compete in a sport on 
the intercollegiate level. The 
challenge was again there, and 
the organization was very tight 
and efficient. 

So I think one can see that 
we are on a good course right 
now. Almost everybody was 
happy with the athletic program 
this year, and I think that more 
people, after hearing about it's ' 
success, will participate next 
year. That is a good goal to 
aim for--a program with maxi-
mum participation and en-
joyment.

to do your own thing, as the cliche goes. We do have certain stand-
ards which we attempt to maintain. but there is plenty of leeway for 
the staff. Furthermore, since we are still in the early stages of our 
growth we are currently in the process of developing a really coherent 
policy. This polley is being formulated by those who take the greates 
part in the paper, so anyone who participates may enter into this en-
deavor. 

Generally speaking we do try to provide several services to the uni-
versity community. First of all, we try to serve as a primary sOU,rce 
of information. While ~objective· is a moot term, we do try to main-
tain a credibility that will enable our reporting to be respected by those 
of widely differing viewpoints. 

Secondly. since a newspaper is a very powerfulforum for the expres-
s ion of ideas, we try to allow responsible spokesmen of any viewpoint 
to express themselves in the paper. The only advantage we have is 
being able to express official newspaper opinion on the Editorial page. 

Beyond this, by lined articles, feature articles, and merely rap articles 
allow a lot of freedom both to our staff members and anyone else who 
might like to contribute. Also, since our paper is typed and pasted up 
on campus a great deal ot creativity can be put into the paper by help-
ing on copy work. 

U you are interested in working for the Triton TImes, please come 
over and discuss with us hat you want to do. For a start, we could use 
reporters and feature writers, sports and fine arts writers, photo-
graphElrs. artists. and copy orkers.
