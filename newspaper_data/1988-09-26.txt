Crabtree 
FreeFrom 
FBI Case 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD student Kristen Crab-
tree, accused of biting an FBI 
agent on the fmF and charged 
with felony assauh in the'case, will 
not be prosecuted by the federal 
,overnment if she doesn'l break 
any laws between now and Sep-
tember, 1989, with the exception 
of minor traffic violations. 

"I think it's a fair resolution for 
Kristen," said Barton Sheela III, 
the student's lawyer. "Kristen wants . 
to get on with her life, and the trial 
is interfering with it.· 

The agreement was made earlier 
this month during bargaining 
between Sheela and the U.S. Dis-
trict Attorney's Office. 

Crabtree could not be reached 
for comment, but she was quoted 
in the Los Angeles nmes as des-
cribing the agreement as "pretty 
much a victory in the total sense. " 

"It's been a stressful experience 
... but I think it's really great 
because we sua:eeded in exposing 
the FBI's role on campUi and their

University Settles Quietly 
Battery Victim Receives $125,000 from School 

By DENISE DADOR 

Sensitive and unUlual circum-
stances surrounding a mis-
demeanor battery case between a 
UCSD research scientist and a 
laboratory technician last fan 
continue to cast a shadow over 
laboratory workers. 

In July, Dr. Michael LOUIS 
Becker, a 32-year-old cancer 
research scientist, pleaded "no 
contest" to charges that he bat-
tered 28-year-old Kelly Ahearn. 

"Obviously there was something 
,oing on between aU the people in 
that research lab," said UCSD 
police officer Tracy M. McLarney, 
who was referring to witness 
testimonies that indicated pro-
fessional strife existed within the 
resean:h center. 

Following Becker's trial, the San 
D~go Tribune learned that UCSD 
discretely paid Ahearn S 125,000 to 
resign from her S2,267-a-month 
job and drop any future claims 
against the university. 

The victim, who was two months 
pregnant at the time, said she 
walked into the lab, a small brown 
stucco building near the University 
Bookstore, and saw Becker chat-
ting with another worker. Ahearn 

said a shoving match ensued 
between her and the doctor after 
he loudly berated her for her job 
performance. 

Ahearn told police that Becker, 
who was aware of her prqnancy, 
shouted at her, poked her in ~ 
chest with his finger and pinned 
her apinst a wall. Ahearn said she 
feU to the ground and struck her 
head on a group of nitrogen tanks 
clustered in the comer of the room. 

Campus police officers arrived 
at the scene and cited Becker for 
misdemeanor battery. Ahearn then 
placed the scientist under citizen's 
arrest. 

Officer McLarney said that dur-
ing the initial confUlion Becker 
stepped forward and acknow-
ledged, "I'm Michael, I'm the one 
you're lookin, for, I did it." 
According to police, Becker ap-
peared to be very calm and re-
mained quiet durin the arrest. 

PoliCe said Ahearn did not 
receive any serious injuries. Officer 
McLarney said she refused medi-
cal aid at the scene, but later 
sought the services of a private 
physician because of fears about 
the health of her unborn child. 

Ahearn was in the process of 
quitting, officer Mclarney said, 

'"the incident jUit speeded thinp 
up. " After the f18ht, police in-
structed Becker to leave the build-
ing while Aheam gathered her 
belongings and vacated the lab.

Chancellor Bans 
Smoking Indoors 

By JOHN SHAW 
Editor in Chief 

Non-smokers can breathe a 
(smoke-free) sigh of relief. UCSD 
too baa jumped on the smoking 
... bsdv..... . 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
re<:ently approved a smoke-free 
policy which prohibits smoking 
in nearly all indoor (and some 
outdoor) areas owned and oper-
ated by UCSD. 

The decision was made this 
summer following a recommen-
dation by an eight-member com-
mittee charged with evaluating 
the wide sweeping smoking ban. 

Last spring, the committee sol-
icited input from faculty, staff 
and students on a proposed 
smokinl policy that would have 
banned the sale of cigarettes and 
even prohibited smoking in out-
door eating facilities. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Develop-
ment John Giebink, who served 
as a ' member of the smoking 
committee, well over 100 com-
ments on the proposed policy 
were received. 

"By land large [the comments 
contained] overwhelmingly sup-
portive statements, ,. Giebink 
said. "Of all the comments re-

ceived, only about half a dOlen 
objected." 

Giebink pointed out that the 
objectors objected only to ele-
ments of the policy and not to the 
policy as a whole. The primary 
objections were to the banning of 
the sale of cigarettes and the pro-
hibiting of smoking in areas adja-
cent to outdoor eating facilities. 

Giebink said that some people 
felt that these two elements of the 
policy were "a bit too heavy. "The 
committee subsequently revised 
the policy to provide for permit-
ted smoking sections at outdoor 
eating areas. The ban on the sale 
of cigarettes was left out of the 
adopted policy altogether . 
Spedftc Area Restricted 

The smoke-free policy, effective 
August IS, 1988, applies to all 
UCSD facilities, owned or leased, 
regardless of location. 

Smoking is not permitted in 
any indoor area, including but 
not limited to: administrative 
offices, private offices, laborato-
ries, classrooms, conference 
rooms, auditoriums, lounges, 
theatres, lobbies, hallways, stair-
wells, rest rooms, libraries, clinics, 
waiting rooms, reception areas, 
University vehicles, machine 
shops, elevators, and food service 
areas. 

Private residential space, such 
as student apartments and dorms, 
are exempt from the policy. 

Also exempt from the policy 
are patients at the UCSD Medical 
'Center who have private rooms 
and have "specific written orders 
from the attendin, physician 
permitting them to smoke."

UCSB Settles Rape Suit 

UC Regents have agreed to pay SI40,OOO to an on-
campus resident hall rape victim who claimed her 
ordeal resulted from a "total absence of reasonable 
security at San Nicolas Hall." The woman was raped 
over the Presidents' Holiday weekend. 

The university did not admit liability for the inci-
dent in the out-of-court settlement on Aug. 5, but 
agreed to pay the sum partly because of "the emo-
tional appeal of a claim of this type," Santa Barbara 
defense attorney Ken Moes said. 
The woman, whose identity the Daily Nexus has 
agreed to keep confidential, was raped. beaten and 
threatened with death for approximately three hours 
in the early morning of Feb. 17. 1987, according to 
the lawsuit. which originally asked for damages in 
excess of 5500,000. - Wade Daniels, Daily Nexus

Vandals Spray Paint Signs 
By DAVID BRooK.S 
Staff Writer 

The war between bikers and 
skateboarders and the adminis-
tration has taken an ugly turn. 
Vandals recently spray painted 
nearly every sign prohibiting skat-
ing and bicycling. according to 
UC police officer Randy Fedak. 

The signs. said Fedak, "are 
very easily fixed . It's just very 

time consuming." 
Skateboarders and bicyclists 

interviewed on the thoroughfare 
between the gym and Revelle plaza 
were unanimous in condemning 
the vandalism. 1The vandalism] 
doesn't make any point for us -
just against us" said Jerry Eck-
hart, a Revelle senior. 

Revelle freshman Ed Kuerner 
agreed that "the vandalism is an 
inappropriate way to express dis-

S_ F.ulb.IMf / C;u."di •• "

cle/skateboard signs by Mandeville Center. 

approval at skateboarding." 
However, most interviewed did 

express disapproval of the no-
skateboarding and bicycling pol-
icy in general. 

Revelle junior Janos Taller 
argued that UCSD's bike and 
skateboard policy should be 
modeled after UCSB. 

Currenti),. UCSB's bicyclers 
and skateboarders travel through 
the campus, not around the cam-
pus, via a series of bike paths. 

Last year, skateboarding and 
bicycling were banned in certain 
well-travelled thoroughfares on 
campus in an attempt to reduce 
accidents between riders and 
pedestrians. In addition, skate-
boarding was banned in on-cam-
pus parking lots. 

Violators can be fined .between 
$25 and $50 by police officers. 

To help with enforcement, the 
UC Police has hired a bicycle 
enforcement officer with author-
ity to write citations. The officer 
will be on a bicycle, but will not 
ride through prohibited areas. 

Officer Fedak pointed out that 
bicycle and skateboard enforce-
ment will only be one of the duties 
of the limited duty peace officer. 

Among other things. the officer 
will assist with campus bicycle 
tours and will also respond to on-
campus situations in which first 
aid may be necessary. 

The new bicycle enforcement 
officer is part of the UC Police 
Department's program to pro-
mote bicycling safety, according 
to Fedak.

Continued from page 1 

Becker's supervisor, Dr. Stephen 
M. Hedrick. said the incident 
temporarily disrupted work 
at thelab and created a"tenseness" 
among workers. especially when 
Ahearn flied suit against Becker. 

Hedrick said the University gave 
Becker a letter of censure indicat-
ing that any more such behavior 
"unbecoming of a scientist" would 
result in termination. Police also 
said a Municipal Court judge sent-
enced Becker to serve a certain 
amount of hours in community 
service. 

According to Hedrick, Becker 
was not known to be a high-strung 
person, although Hedrick believes 
problems existed between Ahearn 
and his assistant. "There was a lot 

of tension between Ahearn and 
everyone in the lab." . 

Hedrick was careful not to diS-
cuss Ahearn's job performance to 
aVOid creating prejudices "in the 
event [Ahearn] wanted to get 
another job in La Jolla." 

McLarney recalled that the 
situation was unusual because 
witnesses were unwilling to talk. 

"Usually. people are just clam-
mering to tell me what happened 
after a fight like that." McLarney 
said, "but the workers just cleared 
the hallways, I had to find some-
one to talk to me." 

The officer has indicated that 
there is a lot more going on in this 
cas: than what is visible. Mclar-
ney attributed the "hush-hush" in 
the laboratory to the strong possi-
bility Ahearn will seek a private 
suit against Becker. 

"It's not over yet," Mclarney 
said.

WATSON: Addresses Issues 
Continued from pile 1 
tion to the campus and the collc-
giate system. One of the inherent 
benefits .. . of the college system is 
that it enables the campus to have 
a variety of approaches to under-
grad uate education." Watson said. 

" I th ink Fifth College is a per-
fect addition to the campus. In 
pan, this is shown by the fact that 
the target for new enrollments for 
Fifth College was 400 freshmen. 
They will open with, \ believe, 
450. That's an indication of tbe 
success and attractiveness of the 
program." 

In response to concern for Fifth 
College general education re-
quirements Watson said that there 
i 'always a question of balance 
and quantity in the general eduCl-
tion; and there was a concern 
about the amount of physical and 
natural science in the GE's. 

"Certainly it's been resolved to 
the point of opening with a stu-
dent body; [but] adjustments have 
to be made," Watson added, 
" .. ,I'm sure that Fifth College, 
over time, based on its experien-
ces, will make adjustments to its 
General Education requirements ... 
A.S. Government 

In keeping with his theme of 
wanting to see variety in under-
graduate education, Watson is 
unconcerned, even somewhat 
pleased, with the status of the 
Associated Students government, 
despite the conflicts that have 
occurred within it. 

"As far as I can tell, the A.S. is 
functioning, and functioning weU. 

"I think any time you bring 
large numbers of people with 
diverse views together, you're 
going to have some differences of 
opinion and controversy," Wat-
son said . "In fact, if there is con-
troversy within ' the A.S., I think 
that 's probably a sign that it is 
functioning effectively, because it 
is a forum for all points of view 
amongst the students to be re-
presented. I think the time to 
really worry is when there seems 
to be no differences of opinion 
within the A.S." 

Watson is not concerned by the 
recent removal of Vaughn Rex as 
UCSA representative by A.S. 
President Maynard Dimmesdale. 
"I had been informed ... [but] it 
was one of many issues," Watson 
said . " \ have felt no particular 
reason to be interesed in it; I 
assume that this is a matter which 
the A.S. would work out within 
itself ... 
Parkin& 

Parking is a major, ongoing 
problem at UCSD. Although 
Watson is not directly involved in 

Crabtree 
Continued from pace I 

link. with the university," Crabtree 
added . 

Scuffle 

In May of 1987, Crabtree was 
taking pictures of an anti-CIA 
demonstration during a career fair 
at the UCSD Career Services Cen-
ter for leftist campus newspaper, 
the New Indicalor, when she 
started photographing FBI agent 
Marene Allison. 

Allison objected, and according 
to court documents, asked Crab-
tree to stop taking pictures when 
she became convinced that Crab-
tree and other students "intended 
to provoke an incident with her 
which Crabtree would capture on 
film ." Crabtree did not stop shoot-
ing, and Allison tried to take the 
camera from Crabtree. During the 
ensuing scuffle, Crabtree bit AlIi-

formulating the campus parking 
policies, he does have some posi-
tions and ideas on the situation. 

"I think parking is an issue 
which the campus is going to have 
to address, and make some diffi-
cult decisions. It either has to 

become much more expensive, or 
there have to be some restrictions 
in terms of who paries on campus." 

In the area of parking and stu-
dent safety, Watson says that a 
new head has been hired for the 
office of student safety and secur-
ity . ..... As the campus becomes 
bigger and the area around the 
campus becomes more urban, we 
want to stay ahead of safety issues 
and crime issue/.' 

"In addition, we have changed 
the name of the Off-campus 
Housing Office to the Commuter 
Student Services Office to em-
phasize that this office now will 
take . . . greater initiatives in serv-
ing the full range of needs of 
commuter students, not just ... 
having a list of off-campus housing 

"We have to recognize that 
roughly two-thirds of our students 
are commuter students. Our goal 
is to house half of our students on 
campus, but still, that means that 
half of our students are commuter 
students. We want to make sure 
that we're doing all we can to have 
a campus circumstance that meets 
the needs of commuter students, 
so we're not biasing our services 
solely toward resident students," 
Watson said. 

Over the summer, last year's 
system of having separated park-
ing spaces for resident and com-
muter students ended. Watson is 
less than complete in his support 
,of the change. 

"As I understand it, lost of con-
cerns were expressed about this. I 
was not directly involved in this 
change. I actually think there were 
some advantages to having desig-

son on the finger. 
In August of 1987,. the Ninth 

Circuit District Court Chief Judge 
Gordon Thompson Jr. dismissed 
the charges against Crabtree after 
concluding that "no reasonable 
juror could find that Crabtree 
assaulted ALlison or that Crabtree 
used unreasonable force." 

While agreeing in principII: with 
Judge Thompson, the Federal 
Appeals court decided last May 
that he had "exceeded [his] author-
ity," and returned the case to 
Thompson. The Appeals Court 
did register its wish, however, that 
the U.S. Attorney's office devote 
time "to more meritorious pro-
secutions. " 

FBI Tactics 

Sheela complained about "the 
tactics that the government has 
used in the case, [including] using 
one UCSD student to investigate 
another student." He was referrin. 

nated resident parking in order to 
facilitate things for commuter 
students. 

Watson cited several programs 
which he has worked on which 
are designed to encourage under-
graduates to become more in-
volved in research on campus, 
and to continue on to graduate 
school. 

"We have established in a more 
formal way the academic enrich-
ment program. This is a program 
which has been designed to en-
courage students to consider going 
on to doctoral programs and to 
consider academic and research 
careers, and do research work 
with the faculty," Watson said. 

Watson cited last spring's first 
annual undergraduate research 
conference as "a success" in this 
area. 

"Related to this is an expanded 
effort to encourage students to 
apply for graduate fellowships," hI 
continued. 

Watson cited a doubling in 
three years in the number of 
National Science Foundation fel-
lowships awarded to UCSD stu-
dents each year as one accomp-
lishment in this area, and ex-
pressed the hope that UCSD will 
soon have its first-ever Rhodes 
Scholar. 
Future P ..... 

Major plans for the future 
include a new recreation, athletics 
and intramurals building, accord-
ing to Watson. He indicated that 
a survey would be taken of stu-
dent opinion on this issue. 

He described the possible new 
building as "a major gym." "I like 
the phrase 'field house'," he said, 
"although it isn't sufficiently des-
criptive ... 

This is "an issue which has been 
discussed for some time, as the 
next major student facility that 
wo.uld come on line. It would, of 
course, require that the students 
approve a referendum, and it 
would therefore have to be some-
thing the students want," Watson 
said. 

If it is approved, the new facil-
ity would be available to "Recrea-
tional Athletics, Intercollegiate 
[Athletics] and the Physical Edu-
cation Department, just like the 
present gym," he said. 

Watson explained that past 
questions which have been raised 
about the structure of these dif-
ferent divisions, and particularly 
Recreational Athletics, have been 
settled. 

"Recreation and Intercollegiate 
Athletics are now two free-
standing departments, if you will, 
in Undergraduate Affairs." 

to a term paper a student intern in 
the U.S. Attorney's office wrote 
concerning his investigation of 
Crabtree's personal life. 

The LA. Times obtained a 
copy of another paper, in which 
the student commented that "ev-
erything that I found was used as 
evidence, which gave me a feeling 
of satisfaction." 

Sheela also claimed the FBI was 
"conducting wholesale investiga-
tions of lots of UCSD students, 
and the FBI was doing this in an 
effort to nail her." 

"She was wiUing to let them 
investigate her, but it's not fair that 
anybody she has lunch with should 
all of a sudden get an FBI ftle 
opened up on them," Sheela added. 

While he wouldn't give exact 
figures, Sheela said that his law 
firm "did the case for about ten 
percent of what we normally 
charF, because we thought she 
was Flting shafted ...

programs are and what they can do. This will be followed by 
an overview of the UNIX system and the use of the '"vi" text 
editor. The course will use a text developed specifically for it.

Chancellor Holds Reception 
By AMANDA DA TNOW 

New students were welcomed to 
UCSD by ChanceUor Richard 
Atkinson during a reception at his 
home. The reception included 
entertainment and a short speech 
by Atkinson. 

The reception was held in 
Atkinson's garden where students 
were left to mingle with one another 
and enjoy refreshments. Upon 
arrival, students were greeted by 
provosts from the different coUeges. 

Atkinson's welcoming speech 
contained some statistics about the 
new entering class. He mentioned 

that there were 20,000 freshman 
applicants, most of whom were in 
the top 12% of their graduating 
classes. 

According to the chancelor, the 
admissions office had to imme-
diately discard 10,000 applicants 
and then choose 2,900 students to 
fill the class. 

Atkinson said the SAT scores of 
the entering class are one of the 
highest in the UC system, second 
only to Berkeley. 

Atkinson also noted that UCSD 
is number one in the nation among 
public universities for medical 
school acceptances. Nationwide, 
UCSD ranks eleventh. 

In addition, he said that UCSD 
is also first in the nation among 
public universities for the number 
of students entering Ph.D. pro-
grams. 

After Atkinson's speech, A.S. 
president Maynard Dimmesdale 
spoke briefly. Dimmesdalestressed 
that while academics are impor-
tant, students should also find time 
to have fun. 

For the remainder of the recep-
tion, students and other guests 
were entertained poolside by • 
Jimmy and Jeanie Cheatham and 
their jazz band. Jimmy Cheatham 
is a music professor and director of 
UCSD's jazz band. 

Jennie Cheetam performs with her husband Jimmy in their four-piece jazz band for guests by the pool.

Smoking 
Continued from pace 1 
University, Chancellor Atkinson 
is quoted as saying that "we have 
a responsibility to ensure the 
health and safety of the UCSD 
community. " 

Atkinson continues,"As a re-
nowned research and educational 
institution, it is appropriate that 
UCSD take a leadership role in 
establishing a smoke-free envir-
onment" 

According to the press release, 
smoking-related diseases cause 
1,000 deaths per day, compared 
to the 350 deaths per day caused 
by alcoholism-related deseases 
and 15 deaths per day caused by 
cocaine, heroin and other drugs. 
Employee Reaction 

Recently, many corporations 
across the United States have 
banned smoking on the job. In 
some cases, employee/ employer 
relations have been strained. 

" It 's just amazing," Wilson 
said . "A couple of people were 
really having a difficulty [quitting 
smoking of the job], but surpris-
ingly there have not been any 
major problems." 

The University is providing 
assistance to employees who wish 
to quit smoking entirely. Smok-
ing cessation programs are held 
by the Faculty and Staff Assist-
ance Program on campus and the 

• Employee Assistance Program at 
the UCSD Medical Center. 

Employee participants who 
complete smoking cessation pro-
grams will receive partial subsidi-
zation of the program cost. 

Students who wish to quit 
smoking can obtain information 
on cessation programs at the Stu-
dent Health Center. 
Economic Facton 

Many businesses and corpora-
tions that have banned smoking 
on the job have done so primarily 
for economic reasons. The theory 
is that by forcing employees to 
quit smoking, workers will 
become more healthy and not be 
forced to miss work due to illness. 
As a result ,prod uctivity will 
increase while health care costs 
decrease. 

Giebink says that economic 
benefits played only a minor role 
in the committee's decision to 
recommend the smoke-free pol-
icy to the chancellor. 

"Those are considerations, but 
I think they were secondary," 
Giebink said. "The major thing is 
the health issue [of second hand 
smoke]. .. we're just concerned 
with a situation where innocent 
people are victims." 
Systemwide Pusb 

The push .. or campuses to 
adopt smoke-free policies appar-
ently came from the top. UC Pres-
ident David Gardner requested 
that all nine chancellors develop 
and adopt smoking policies for 
their respective campuses. 

According to Wilson, UC San 
Francisco has adopted a smoke-
free policy almost identical to the 
one adopted at UCSD. Wilson 
said that the other seven UC 
campuses are in the process of 
evaluating similar policies. Not a 
single campus, Wilson said, had 
indicated that it would refuse to 
adopt a smoke-free policy. 

The eight-member smoking 
committee had representatives 
from a variety of campus units, 
including the Medical Center, 
Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography, Personnel, and Aca 
emic Affairs. According to Gie-
bink, the committee - which 
included at least one smoker -
unanimously voted to recom-
end the smoke-free policy be 
approved.

The Guardian is puhlisht<l twict weekly at the University of California. 
San Diego Con1 enls e 1988. Views expre sed herein aft not necessarily 
those of t he UC Board of Resents. the ASUCSD or the Guardian. 

Atkinson Entombed 
A School of Architecture, yeah, sure. 
It11 be pretty, and prestigious, and real estate 

developers wiII donate money to the school. 
Chancellor Atkinson, entombed in his office, iso-

lated from student contact, continues on his endless 
mission to turn UCSD into a "great university, "i.e., a 
university with lots of professional schools and 
alumni money. 

The architecture school and a downtown annex are 
his two latest brainstorms. 

We can't help noticing that both will, as usual, reap 
o nly incidental benefits for students - an architec-
ture school won't help a campus already uglified 
beyond redemption by the Western Hemisphere's 
largest accumulation of concrete rectangles - and 
that decisions on both were arrived at while the cam-
pus is gawking through an enormous growth period 
with oversized classes, a lack of university services, 
and rapidly increasing fees . 

Atkinson has shown no disposition during his 
tenure to consider the education and support of the 
students who pay the fees that make this university 
run. It's time for Atkinson to make a public and 
important gesture of his support for the students of 
the university. -

How about a serious commitment to a reduction in 
class size and the use ofT.A.s? Or a serious commit-
ment to an amphitheater big enough to lure touring 
bands? How about our chancellor teaching a class in 
university administration or his academic specialty, 
psychology? 

Another idea worth considering is a State of the 
Campus address: Atkinson could take a loudspeaker 
and speak at noon one day on Revelle Plaza about 
where he thinks this campus should be headed and 
how we're going to get there. Accepting questions 
from the crowd after the speech, there would be no 
helicopter around to deflect unpleasant or inconve-
nient inquiries . . 

Whatever Atkinson chooses to do, the time has 
come for him to add flesh to the shadowy figure he 
cuts on campus. 

Smoking Solution

-"I'm II Fool/or II Cil.dt~"

Presented with a series of harsh and moralistic 
solutions to the dilemma of smoki:.g on campus, a 
campus committee did us proud o,'er the summer. 

Banning all smoking everywhere, banning the sale 
of cigarettes and two to five years in prison for those 
with nicotine stains - well, maybe not the last one -
were options considered by the group convened last 
spring. 

After soliciting campus input and getting over 100 
letters, after holding open and public hearings and 
after looking for solutions. that made the campus 
habitable for everyone, the committee came up with 
compromises: no smoking indoors, where second 
hand smoke is both irritating and a danger to health, 
smoking areas at all outdoor eateries, and no ban on 
the sale of something a large percentage of the cam-
pus is clearly interested in buying. 

The brouhaha in the last Del Mar city election, 
over a a ballot initiative which more or less would 
have criminalized smoking, and which resulted in no 
smok.ing plan in place, was the wrong way to do it. 

For both the open way in which the committee 
went about its task. and its consideration of personal 
r ights, the smoking committee was the right way to do 
it . The members deserve co m mendation.

Letters 
Dimmesdale's 
Equanimity 

Editor: 
A number of people have expressed 

concern regarding the latest article in 
the Guardian in which I'm portrayed 
as an insensitive and unyielding 
tyrant. Included in the article is a 
rather colorful metaphor whereby 
I'm likened to a portion of the anat-
omy. Several suggestions have been 
offered as to how I should respond to 
such accusations so as to, hopefully, 
ameliorate my image before the stu-
dent body. 

I can only offer thefoUowing words 
which will apply to this and possibly 
future incidents. 

Being in the position of A.S. Presi-
dent one is subject to criticism for 
everything, everywhere, by everyone. 
Various avenues of attack are readily 
available for those in "discomforting 
positions." The Guardian, for exam-
ple, could use a little livening up and 
what better way than to incorporate a 
little ribaldry (name calling) and 
selective journalism. Even the simp-
lest of publi~tions can become over-

night hits when using such tactics. 
Moreover, nothing is always 

favorable to everyone. There are some 
things, such as vetoed legislation, 
denied funding, program cancel-
lations and yes, removal from office 
that cause a certain amount of ill-will 
betweeen students members and my-
self. Naturally, people become of-
fended when faced with a negative 
situation and we all understand that 
different people have different ways 
of reacting. This explains why some 
things may have been said and why 
it's not necessary or appropriate to 
respond to every issue the Guardian 
manufactures. 

In real life ex-presidential aides 
don't call the presidents silly names 
and the Washington Post doesn't 
print them. It's a matter of respect 
and professionalism. This (UCSD) 
however, isn't "real" life. It's more 
like the training ground. I would ven-
ture to guess that in the future, these 
same individuals when confronted 
with similar situations would respond 
differently. 

The bottom line is this - it's the 
student-at-Iarge that 1 rely upon when 
it comes to discerning news from 
story.

Assorted Vinyl 
Is Special 
Editor: 
I would like to call to your attention a 
detail in the article "University Cen-
ter on Schedule" [Guardian, Sept. 
19]. In this article, it was stated that 
"Retail services will include automatic 
banking machines, a travel service, 
copy center and record store." 

I would like to emphasize the fact 
that this is not just any "record store" 
that will be located in Price Center. 
The "record store" is Assorted Vinyl. 

Please note that Assorted Vinyl is 
more than just another retail service; 
we arc a student-staffed and student-
operated enterprise ofthe Associated 
Students of UCSD. Both the Asso-
ciated Students and Assorted Vinyl 
have invested a great deal of time, 
money, and effort in planning As-
sorted Vinyl's move from its current 
location in the Student Center to the 
Price Center site, and we are disap-
pointed that the Guardian has seem-
ingly ignored this in labeling Assorted 
Vinyl as only a "record store."

This workshop will offer a practical exploration of the 
problems and possibilities of literary translation; theoretical 
considerations will be derived mainly from practice. The 
texts will be brief but representative of French writers from 
the expository prose of Descartes through the prose poems 
of Henri Michaux. Other authors are likely to include 
Rousseau, Stendhal, Proust and Baudelaire. It is hoped that 
the detailed analysis of short texts by means of a search for 
equivalent English will provide illumination for the reading 
of French literature in general. The ultimate aim of the 
course is to evoke an awareness of those aspects of French 
which are not translatable and thus to provide an increased 
awareness of the unique qualities of the language. 
Weekly translations and class participation are required. 
Each student will, in addition, select a somewhat longer text 
to translate as an individual project. This course will be 
conducted in English. A good reading knowledge of French 
is indispensable.

Ninety-nine Won't Do 
"Political campaigns are de-

signedly made into emotional

allention from the real i$Sues 
involved. and they actUIJlly partl-
Iyze what slight powers of cere· 
bration man can normally

is in a panic. There's money to be 
lost. The industry can't afford to 
lose another battle. And maybe it 
won't. 

The detective says that since 
there aren't enough cops to go 
around, he will be forced to spend 
all his time chasing down no good 
cigarette smuggling gang mem-
bers. This means the detective 
won't have any time to protect 
you or your children. 

Well, I think we all know who 
would vote for a law that en-
dangers children - that 's right, 
criminals and godless Commu-
nists. You're not one of them. are 
you? 

As the election draws nearer, I 
imagine the commercials will 
become even more paranoid. 11 
won't be long before that detec-
tive starts warning that if we put a 
tax on cigarettes, then hordes of 
terrorists will descend upon your 
hometown and torture your loved 
ones - even Brownie, your ador-
able puppy. . 

And who would vote for a law 
that condones puppy and loved 
one torture - that's right, crimi-
nals and heartless psychopaths. 

With these commercials, the 
tobacco industry has managed to 
divert your attention from the 
real issue of taxation to tbe more 
emotional (though unrelated) 

issues of gang violence and drug 
abu e. 

Of course this is not the first 
time the tobacco industry has 
misled the American public. They 
used to claim that cigarettes were 
good for you. 

But you can't blame them, 
they're only trying to make a 
buck. And who would distort 
facts and mislead voters just to 
make a buck? That's right, crimi-
nals.

The tobacco industry has come 
up with some very ingenious tele-
vision and radio commercials that 
attempt to convince voters that a 
vote for Prop 99 is a vote for 
something akin to hell on earth. r---------------------------------

By JOHN SHAW 
Editor in Chief 

I guess you can't blame the tobacco industry for trying to 
make a buck. After all, these 

are hard times. In the past 20 
years, the industry has managed 
(rather miraculously) to endure 
some major setbacks. 

The FCC banned cigarette 
commercials on TV. The surgeon 
general said that cigarettes caused 
cancer and required manufactur-
ers to admit it on their packages 
and advertisements. Large num-
bers of people quit smoking. No 
smoking sections were required in 
restaurants and airplanes. Corpo-
rations banned smoking on the 
job. Here at UCSD, Chancellor 
Atkinson has banned smoking 
nearly everywhere indoors. 

For the first time ever, the 
industry was forced to pay dam-
ages to a man whose wife died of 
cancer after smoking for most of 
her adult life. And now, Proposi-
tion 99 threatens to place a tax on 
the sale of cigarettes in California. 

It's no wonderthat the industry 

The commercials use a com-
pelling (though twisted) logic. If 
you make a law, some people are 
bound to break it. Crime is created 
when people break laws. There-
fore, a vote for a new law is a vote 
for increased crime. And who 
wants more crime - that's right, 
criminals. 

Pretty tricky, eh? 
So, the only people who would 

vote for Prop 99 are criminals and 
probably bleeding heart liberals 
who have it in for R.J. Reynolds 
and the .. American" system. 

OK., that's the logic. Now for 
the all important visuals and irre-
levant (but partially accurate) 
facts. 

O n TV you'l see an over-worked cop. He's not in 
uniform, so you assume 

he's some kind of detective. He 
talks straight and he's pissed off. 
He's much like Morton Downey, 
Jr. He's at the scene of a crime. 
Some no good gang members 
have just smuggled a van load of 
cigarettes across state lines. With 
the profits they will make from 
selling untaxed cigarettes, the no 
good gang members will buy lots 
of guns and lots of crack.

'Since the reaents are 
the source of the trou-
ble and the resistance, 
let's chao Ie the 
relents.' 

By BRIAN HILL 

O n the eastern front durinl World War I, poorly 
armed Russian peasants 

characd the German trenches until 
the German machine sunnen 
complained their field of fire was 
blocked by biDs of corpses, 

Is the human usault a bad tac-
tic? It's our tactic:. 

Every protest season students 
with placards me throush Sproul 
Plaza at UC Berkel8y, whcrepolic:e 
knock them down lilce carnival 
ducks. This painful ritual is the 
student substitute for loma to the 
polls, since students are liven little 
or no say in how the university is 
run. 

It works, sort of. 
When the protests reach an 

extreme pitch, when thousands of 
anarY students have been up Disht 
and day for months resistilll at 
every turn, when the media focuses 
in and the nation decries the uni-
venity, the repts live in and 
rnaIte a promise. They promile to 
divest. They promile fRe speech. 

Later, they break the promise. 
AU they have to do is circle a pen 
around some of the ambipities 
they wrote into the promise in the 
first place, and the whole effort of 
students is Iaraely undone. 

They promised divestment, but 
have they sold a single stock? They 
promise free speech, but Stoney 
Burke gets arrested for talkin in 
DwineUe Plaza. The campus "free 
speech zone" exists only on Sproul 
Plaza between 12:00 and 1:00, with 
a permit. 

If the only way we can change 
things is to spend thousands, if not 
millions of peop1e-houn marching 
and sitting around, and getting 
beat up and thrown in jail for a 
promise that is later broken -
then no wonder we can' get any-
thing done. We are inefficient. 

I t's the efficient regents who arc usually the source of 
resistance to the modest 

changes which the majority of 
students, faculty and staff agree 
to. Who are these guys? And I do 
mean SUys. They're apointed to 
12-ycar tenns by the governor. 
That means mostly rich, white 
reactionary, capitalist old men

A Christian Case Against Bush 
'Is the Reagan ad-
ministration doing 
enough for those 
suffering from 
[AIDS}? I think 
the answer is "no. ,,, 

By DERICK SCOVEL 

Well, it all started sometime this 
past spring when I promised myself 
that I would somehow get involved 
with the presidential elections. At 
first , I was uncertain as to what the 
nature of this involvement should 
be. 

However, last Ju!y) , the task on 
which 1 should focus my efforts 
became so evident, it was as if the 
message of Fate had written itself 
on the pages of The Aggie. In fact , 
it did! 

There was a rather lengthy Guest 
Opinion which, among other 
things, claimed that the Reagan-
Bush administration represented a 
"strongly Christian background." 

Now, I have seen this type of 
argument used in favor of Reagan 
on many occasions. Perhaps then, 
to use the proverbial phrase, this 
article was the straw that broke the 
camel's back. 

As a religious studies major and 
a future seminarian, I feci an obli-
gation to address aspects of life 
related to my field of study. Much 
the same, for example, as a wildlife 
and fISheries major misht want to 
comment politicaUy on the ecolog-
ical effects of a certain government 
program. 

This is by far the greatest fallacy 
held by those in connection with 
the present conservative climate in 
America today. 

Let us first take a look at the 
ministry of Jesus Christ. In short, 
it is apparent that the task Jesus 
undertook during his lifetime (we're 
not talking death on the cross or 
resurection, folks) was to bring 
comfort to the afflicted, good news 
to the poor, and peace. 

If you d isagree, try reading the 
Gospels, especially in Luke 4: 16-20 
where Jesus quotes Isaiah in 
announcing his Messiahship. 

Next, it follows that we need a 
definition of a "good" Christian. I 
think, and for my purposes in this 
article, that a "good" Christian is 
someone sensitive to the teachings 
of Christ, who attempts to follow 
those methods of living, and 
believes religiously in the ministry 
of Jesus. 

If this is so, it should be quite 
obvious that the Reagan-Bush 
track record displays that both 
leaders are anything but "good" 
Christians. 

Let us look at Jesus' ministry in 
parts. In terms of "comfort to the 
afflicted," there are many actions 
oft he administration which I could 
criticize, but one of the most dis-
turbing is the treatment of AIDS 
by the leaders in this country. 

Have Reagan and Bush really 
done enough for those suffering 
from one of the most devasting 
diseases in our recent history? I 
think the answer is a resounding 
"'no," 

On the other hand, Jesus healed 
all who were afflicted with diseases 
that came to him. For example, he 
healed the lepers, who were the 
disease-ridden outcasts of his 
society's time. 

The homeless , in great numbers, 
are neglected in the government's 
budget spending on low-income 
housing. 

Numbers of the jobless are 
covered up by the inclusion of mil-
itary in statistical studies, and there 
has been a significant decrease in 
spending on Social Security. 

Next is the point of "peace 
What have Reagan and Bush done 
for peace? Yes, we did have peace 
talks with the Soviet Union, but I 
recall we also had Grenada, Nica-
ragua, the Contra affair, Lebanon 
and the Persian Gulf. 

Last summer, a U.S . ship des-
troyed an Iranian commercial air-
plane, killing 290 people. If we're 
not killing others, we're getting 
killed by deploying soldiers to war 
lones like Lebanon. In the long 
run, ] would hardly call any of 
these actions peaceful. 

]n short, through this series of 
concise examples, I hope to have 
enlightened the reader that 
Reagan-Bus h do not represent 
Christian ideals in the least bit. In 
fact, Reagan and Bushduringtheir 
past administration have provided 
anything but a Christian example. 

Lastly, ] would like to point out 
that Reagan has not worshipped in 
an)' church. 

Actually, I think Reagan's truly 
apathetic and anything-but-tactful 
approach toward Christianity was 
most poignantly expressed in his 
own simplistic excuse for not 
attending church. 

He said in so many words, "I do 
not attend church for fear, if there 
were an attempt on my life, of 
bringing harm to those worshiping 
at the church." 

Well, if you believe that one, 
folks, you might as well vote for 
Bush in November. 

Derick Scovel wrote this com-
mentary for the Cal Age ot UC 
Davis. 

The difference being that my 
field is interested in addressilll the 
socio-relilious ideologies of politi-
cal leaders. Hence, it disturbs me 
when I hear Republicans mention 
the Reagan-Bush administration 
in association with Christianity. 

As for "good news to the poor," 
I think the Reapn-Bush slopn 
should be "good news to the rich."

involved in the defense industry 
or finance who were appointed by 
Ronald Reapn and George Deuk· 
mejian, with one or two liberals 
and space cases thrown in by 
Jerry Brown. 

For years these people have 
been making us fight to keep what 
we already have a right to, which 
channels our energy away from 
more forward thinp. Since the 
regents are the soura: of the trou· 
ble and the resistance, let's change 
the regents. Let's fIX thinp so that 
they have to face elections. 

If the regents had to face an elec· 
tion every four years or so, the 
diversity of the board would radi-
cally increase. The regents would 
be much more representative of 
the state population as a whole, 
and much more responsive to the 
ooaoing needs of an evolving 
university. 

Most students and community 
groups interested in improving the 
university should be able to act 
behind this proposal. It's a lona 
term investment which would 
dmnatically reduce the amount of 
effon, sacriflCle and bloodshed 
required to advlUlClC change. 1be 
benefits of the regents' increased 
responsiveness would accrue to 
every cause. 

How about those weapons labs? 
How about an ethnic studies 
requirement? How about better 
retention of minorities? How about 
a peace studies department? How 
about divestment? how about 
smaller cIaaes for unclerJraduates, 
tauabt by actual profeaors?

who responded to community 
pressure. 

C hanging the way the regents are chosen would appear to mean a change in the 
state constitution, because the 
provisions for appointing the 
regents are written into it . It would 
mean gathering enough signatures 
for a citizens' initiative, and one 
hell ofa campaign (or several suc· 
cessive campaigns) to get the req· 
uisite percentage of the vote. 

In the end, a participatory uni-
versity would give students hands-
on experience in democracy. Cur· 
rently, impressionable young stu-
dents, the supposed future leaders 
of the state, learn a bad lesson 
from a public university run like a 
private reform school. 

It is appropriate that the found-
ers of the University of California 
named our trustees "regents" -
the word means a person appointed 
to rule a monarchy while the sov-
ereign is absent or too youna or 
incapacitated to rule. 

Well, the students and faculty of 
this university, and the people of 
this state, are not children. We 
have the capacity to govern our 
own university.

UCSD Lab Manipulates Fly Genes' 
By DENNIS WOO 
Staff Writer 

The fly had legs growing where 
its antennae should be. 

Scientists found the insect d~ 
veloping that wayan its own, a 
sort of Believ~It-or-Not freak of 
nature. Now, it turns out, they can 
create such a mutation artificially. 

Be afraid. .. be very afraid. 
Molecular geneticist Jim Po-

sakony couldn't be happier. He 
heard news of the mutation at a 
conference of fruit fly researchers. 

"This is an example of how 
powerful an organism drosophila 
(the fruit fly) can be for investigat-
ing developmental questions," he 
said. Each year, Posalcony and 
over a thousand other fly-minded 
scientists meet to discuss such 
findings. 

other types of labs nearby - yeast successive experiment reveals more 
labs, leech labs. frog labs - but about the relationship between 
these hold little attraction for him. bodily growth and genes.

"It's a kind of a prejudice. But, 
in a sense, it's prejudice that I'm 
grateful for." No one has ever 
launched a raid on his lab to set the 
fruit flies free. 

"I think people are more COM-
fortable with using lower orga-
nisms for research purposes." Peo-
ple are less likely to be emotional 
about raising insects for research 
than raising manupals, Posakony 
said. 

Environmentalists. not animal 
rights activists, have been the 
greater critics of fly research. Ten 
years ago, concern about gen~ 
splicing affected work on flies and 
other lab organisms. Posakony 
said. 

Certain experiments were fed-
erally regulated to ensure that 
potentially dangerous results 
wouldn't be released into the 
environment.

fearful notion of mixing AIDS

Guide Dog Exchanges 
Sight for TLC 

By JULIE MUNRO 
Features Editor 

When Vera Saliba was young, 
a black Labrador retriever vic-
iously chased her down and al-
most bit her. thereby initiating in 
her a long-lasting and powerful 
fea r of dogs. Today she spends 
nearly every hour of the day with 
this same breed of dog close by 
her side. 

Saliba spent a busy month this 
summer in San Rafael at training 
camp. She was not, however, 
headed for South Korea. She was 
at Guide Dog for the Blind Inc., 
working out with her new room-
mate, pet, companion, and guide, 
Amaris. 

Saliba began considering a 
guide dog three years ago and, 
althouah "terrified of dOIS," she 
decided last year that she would 
follow through. "Before I was 
able to chanae my mind, 1 wrote 

them a letter," she said. 
There is a long waiting list for 

guide dogs. Saliba had to wait a 
full year for Amaris. The guide 
dog school interviews applicants 
and matches their lifestyle needs 
and personalities to that of the 
dogs. 

The guide dog school where 
Saliba met Amaris is privately 
funded. but individuals and cor-
porations donate the $10,000 cost 
of a dog to five of the twenty-four 
students in each session. 

Saliba was financially sup-
ported in this endeavor by the 
Karl Kirchgessner Foundation. 

"We need to know how to cor-
rect the dog fairly and not be 
cruel." Saliba said of the month-
long training session.

almost as much attention as I 
have with her." It is, however 
nice to know everybody think~ 

Amaris is beautiful," Saliba said. 
Amaris was raised by Beth 

Heine, a Four-H member, for the 
first year and a half of her life. 

Guide dOIS often become tired 
and uncooperative after about 
eight or nine yean. When they are 
retired from duty, they are then 
either kept as pets by their blind 
companion, or given back to the 
school which finds a home for 
them. 

Every year, a representative of 
Guide Dogs for the Blind Inc. 
visit each dog, which is still prop-
erty of the school. They then con-
firm that the guide dogs they have 
trained are being cooperative and 
not botherins other people. 

"The main concern we have is 
the public, we want the public to 
be satisfied," a representative of 
the company said. 

The dop and their new com-
panions are really put to the test 
at the school. They brave such

Posalcony gave as a hyPothetical 
example. 

"The chances are almost zero 
that there would be any effect from 
doing that," said Posakony, but 
such an experiment would be ria-
idly contained. 

Currently, Posalcony isn' intro-
ducing anything new to the flies. 
He's just experimenting with the 
genes they already have. 

A bug is Q bug. Unless it's afly. 
Why flies? Posakony said that 

the public misunderstands why 
particular lcinds of research are 
done. 

"If it's very clinical research 
which is directly addressina an 
issue of therapy for a diIease, I 
think people can understaDd that 

They can relate to that l'IJey've 
been sick themselves." 

Misundentandinp occur about 
scie~for-teience's sake - basic 
research which appean to have no 
intended immediate application.

distant aDd very removed. But 
basic research very frequently is 
the aenesis of the idea for IO~ 
thing that's more clinical. And, 
actually, even if you work in tbe 
field, it takes awhile to appreciate 
that fact." 

This case is made when related 
to AIDS.

ways of dealing with AIDS are 
dependent upon the fact that we

Gaining proficiency in the mys-
terious and often baffling world of 
the almiahty computer can often 
be not only frustrating, but also 
time consuming. 

Unfortunately, not all systems 
and their training manuals are 
user-friendly, which leads to hours 
of inefficient time usaae. Under a 
tight schedule, the delays can be 
devastating.

Imagine havinS a whole super 
computer at your fingertips or 
even several different computer 
systems available for your use.free 
of charge. 

Believe it or not you, a regis-
tered student, have all of this 
available to you through the 
Academic Computin, Center. 
According to Jeny Fitzsimmons, 
manaaer of User Services, the 
center "exists for the sole purpose 
of supporting the educational 
instruction on campUl." 

Fear not, thouah, ye depart-
ment holders of ltand-alone com-
puter Iystems. The UCSD Career 
Services Center has recopized 
your plisht and has created Rent-
A-Tech to aid in solving your 
independent system problems and 
questions. 

Oriainatin& from a plea by the 
Chancellor's oftIce in December, 
1987, for help with traininS on a 
new computer system, coordina-
tor Judi Griffith, working clOldy 
with the Academic Computing 
office, fmally opened the proaram 
in May, 1988. Since the initial 
introduction, the program has 
developed into a multi-faceted 1ICf-
vice group. 

Through Rent-A-Tech, depart-
ment faculty members can com-
mission a qualified student to per-
form computer services ransinB 
from hardware and software in-
stallation and staff trainina to 
manual documentation and the 
desiping of templates. 

They will even assist in moving 
the equipment and malcing minor 
technical adjustments. 

As students, the technicians are 
not authorized for major repairs, 
but are capable of diasnosinS sys-
tem problems and, if the problem 
is beyond their technical capabili-
ties, are able to refer clients to 
other help sources. 

"We are a temporary service 
whose tasks include the training of 
personnel on various hardware 
and software packages," explained 

Griffith. ~e program is set up to 
assist department staff in their 
micro-computer needs." 

The beauty of the Rent-A-Tech 
lies in a number of factors. 

First and foremost, there is no 
actual charge to the UICfS. Rent-A-
Tech is operated on a 100 percent 
recharge basis throuah the d~ 
partment sub3 supplies and ex-
pense accounts. 

Fees are minimal - only SIO.4S 
per hour, of which $9.95 goes 
toward student 'payroll. The ~ 
maining SO cents aoes toward 
administrative COlts.

Use of the program cuts costs, 
and provides on-campus jobs for 
any capable students. 

According to Griffith, many 
departments buy service contracts 
at costs of up to $2.200 per year, 
but often end up needing the ser-
vice only once or twice per year. 

"That amounts to $1,100 per 
hour," she said. For large systems 
which use parts valued at above 
the cost of the service contracts, 
purchase may be beneficial "But," 
continued Griffith, --Cor depart-
ments with inexpensive systems, 
utilization of the on-campus pro-
gram serves III another possibility

Though the service cost is min-

Rent-A-Tech is highly recom-
mended by its previous users. Dr. 
Martin Haas, an associate adjunct 
professor working out of the 
UCSD cancer research center, 
showed great delight with the 
service. 

"I was extremely satisfied," he 
commented. "Like a magician the

accounts on System S UNIX. 
These individual penonal ac-
counts are available to all stu-
dents. All you have to do is apply; 
no faculty approval or recom-
mendation is required. A System 
S account allows students to access 
a computer for electronic mail, 
personal computing, and word

Electronic mail is useful for 
communicatins with people all 
over the nation who use the UNIX 
system. UC Berkeley is one cam-

with on UNIX. Mail can be sent 
instantly from screen to screen. If 
the other account owner is online 
at the time the mail is sent, they 
will receive it immediately; oth-
erwise, their mail is saved for 
them in the computer system. The 
next time they loa on, they will

Basis For Financial 
Aid Diversifies 
By ERIK KNUTZEN 
Stqff Writer 

Fungus scholars with financial 
problems take note - the Myco-
logical Society of America has a 
wad of cash sitting in an office 
begging for use. 

Students can get additional 
information from department 
bulletin boards, and from infor-
mation kiosks located outisde the 
Financial Services Offices. The 
office also offers scholarship 
workshops early in winter quarter. 

All continuing UCSD students 
who have a GPA of at least 3.5 
will receive a scholarship applica-
tion later this fall for the 1989-90 
school year_ Those who have a 
lower GPA may also apply_ 

If, instead, you are a woman 
flyer who prefers helicopters, the 
International Women Helicopter 
Pilots may find you eliaible for a 
$4000 "Whirly Girls Scholarship. " 

With the costs of a college edu-
cation rising each year, many stu-
dents need financial help to make 
ends meet. Fortunately, one need 
not have an interest in fungus or 
helicopters to apply for most 
scholarships. 

Ann Klein, Associate Director of 
Student Financial Services 

"Scholarships are awards that 
are based on merit, academic 
excellence, and future potential," 
Ann Klein, associate director at 
Student Financial Services said. 
"Somebody who's interested in a 
scholarship presumably has a 
strong academic baclcground and 
has the potential to achieve at 
UCSD." 

Three basic types of scholar-
ships are available: those offered 
by the UC system as a whole, 
those offered specifically at 
UCSD, and scholarships pro-
vided by outside organizations, 
individuals, and corporations. 

Most scholarships, but not aU, 
require demonstrating financial 
need . Two notable exceptions are 
the prestigious Regent's Scholar-
ship and Alumni scholarships, 
which are granted solely on the 
basis of academic excellence. 

New this fall is the Ellen and 
Roger Revelle scholarship for dis-
tinguished entering freshmen, a 
four-year scholarship which was 
jointly accepted by two students 
this year. 

The competed applications, due 
Jan. I I, are sent to a panel of 
faculty members who, in Febru-
ary, rank the applicants admidst 
clouds of pipe smoke and fur-
rowed brows. 

For those interested in scholar-
ships from outside sources, Debi 
Fiddler, Assistant Director of 
Student Financial Services, recom-
mends against paying for the 
scholarship search services adver-
tised by private companies in 
glossy junk mail brochures sent to 
many high school and college 
students ... It's not cost effective," 
Fiddler said, "some of them are 
charging S65 and S75 to provide 
information students can fmd on 
their own in the library." 

Student Financial Services pro-
vides a small library for students 
interested in outside scholarships_ 
A comprehensive search of these 
books might tum up scholarships 
for those who do not qualify for 
one of the UC scholarships. 

In addition, or in place of scho-
larships, students may also apply 
for Grants, work-study programs, 
and student loans, aU of which are 
based on need. 

For the desperate, the univer-
sity also has emergency .JO.day . 
and 6O-day loans for cash and 
paying fees. 

Fellowships, specifically the 
P'resident's Undergraduate 
Fellowship and the David Jay 
Gambee Memorial FellOWShips, 
are available in mid-May. 

These feUowships provide funds 

There are other merit-based 
scholarships as well. For out-
standing entering st udents who 
are interested in social sciences, 
for example, there is the Betty 
Ramseyer Scholarship. For those 
who are entering as communica-
tion majors, there is the Clayton 
H. Brace Scholarship. 

All Sad'.II'an/Guordion 
Debi Fiddler. Assistant Director of 
Student Financial Services. 

UCS D Financial Services is 
working to encourage and pro-
mote an increase in the pool of 
solely merit-based scholarships 
awarded to students by outside 
organizations, individuals, and 
corporations. 

Klein recommends that students 
interested in scholarship~ visit the 
F inancial Service Office behind 
the bookstore, which i subdi-
vided into five offices erving each 
of the five colleges, with an addi-
lional office for graduate students. 

for research, which can include 
anything from laboratory work 
for science majors, to travel 
junkets for humanities students, 
to art supplies for artists. 
. The Gambee Fellowship specif-
tcally addresses the esoteric areas 
of "university governance and! or 
ecological values clarification." 

"The key for students is to be 
persistent, follow the directions, 
meet the deadlines, and to stay 
organized," Klein said. "Keep 
track of what you send, where 
you send it, and how you can fol-
low up. The energetic students 
who puts his effort into it will 
hopefully end up with ome sort 
of ~cholar hip," Klein added.

We started out with a very sim· 
pie idea. 

To make electronic typewriters 
and word processors that have lots 
of great features but are very simple 

to use. 
So simple you 

don't have to keep 
one eye on your 
typing and one eye 
on the instruction 
manual. We make 

die simplest 
typewriters 
in memory. 

So simple you 
don't need a degree 
in computer pro· 

gramming to operate them. 
So simple they can even make 

a confinned non·typi t comfortable 
at the keyboard. 

Call it human engineering if you 
like. Or call it ergonomics. Or call it 
plain old inspiration. 

What we came up with is a 
line of remarkable typewriters that 
are sophisticated without being 
complicated. 

In fact, they're unlike any other 
typewriters you've ever seen before ... 
or used before ... or muttered at before. 

Take our new Smith Corona 
SO 700. (Lots of propIe a re going to.) 

We call the 0700 the Memory 
Typewriter. ¥oujustmaycall it the 
simplest typewriter in memory. 

It features a 7.000 character 
editable memory you can access with 
the mere Hip of a switch. 

Combined with the ]6 character 
LCOdisplay, you can proofread. cor· 
rect and make changes before you 
ever put anything down on paper. 

Of course. should you want to 

lIlake changes on paper, we've made 
that simpler than ever loo. 

On the SD 700, as well as on 
every new Smith Corona typewriter, 
}'Oll1l find our new correcting 
cassette. 

It's easy-to-load and you can 
insert it in seconds. 

1nerearenospoolsto 
unwind. No complicated threading. 
No tangles. 

So nowcorrecting misUlkes 
isaseas asmaki~them. 

We've refonned 
die correction system.. 

Add features like a Spell·Right'· 
50.000 word electronic dictionary. 
YlbrdFind: WordEraser; Full Line 
Correction and much more and you've 
got a typewriter that's not just incred-
ibly Simple to use, but simply impoSt 
sible to pass up. 

Of course. the same goes for 
every other Smith Corona typewriter 
and word processor as well. 

Which is why we 
recommend that you 
hurry to your nearest 
store and tryour 
machines yourself. 

Obviously. they 
won't come to you.

I Amaris 
Continued from pap 10 
precarious situations as busy 
streets without sidewalks and down-
town San Francisco. 

Saliba unhesitantly confirmed 
that it was scary to make the 
change from using a cane to trust-
ing a panting, playful canine to 
pick her way through this often 
chaotic world. 

"Especially in Chinatown, I 
thought I was going t.o die there 
... 1 have never seen that many 
people in one place in my whole 
life!" Saliba said. ,,(Amaris] was 
really great, she got excited about 
all the smells." 

The main problem is that when 
Amaris gets distracted, "she's a 
little bit smarter than other dogs, 
but she's stiD a dog and she's still 
interested in everything other dogs 
are," Saliba said. Amaris has even 
taken off after a cat whileon duty. 

Editor s note: The following is a 
letter from Vera Saliba, the Third 
College students who recently 
joinedforces with a guide dog. 

By VERA SALIBA 

New, unique, and exciting on 
campus is a guide dog named 
Amaris. I am sure many of you 
have heard of dogs guiding the 
blind and wondered how they work 
and how effective their work is. 

Well, wonder no more, because 
Amaris' work is very amazing and 
it is my pleasure to be able to share 
my knowledge about guide dogs 
and my experience with Amaris 
with all of you. 

Guide Dogs for the Blind Inc. in 
San Rafael. California, trains dogs 
in a period offour to six months to 
do the following: Walk: in a straight 
line, tum left and right upon 
command, locate steps, curbs, eJe.. 
vators, doorways, etc ... 

The dogs must cross streets in a 
safe manner, protect themselves 
and their masters from obstacles 
on sidewalks, including moving 
obstacles such as pedestrians. 

When this training period is 
completed, the organization as-
signs a guide dog to its new com-
panion based on the person's per-
sonality and physical needs. 

The organization offers indiv-
iduals a four-week: course that 
allows the student and dog to 
establish a good workina relation-
ship and tcaches the blind person 
how to handle, control, and care 
for the dog. 

Amaris and I went through the 
very enjoyable course this summer 
and now we work as a team. 

When Amaris is wearing her 
harness, she is \\<orkingfor me. She 
listcm to my commands and fol-
lows through with them, unless she 
determines it is not safe. if this is 
the case, she shows me the obstacle 
and waits for my commands. 

She is trained to move me 
around pedestrians, so moving out 
of her way is more confusing than 
helpful to bert In addition, if she 
gets used to having pedestrians 
move out of her way, she will learn 
not to clear me from other ollsta-
cles on .idewalks which can be 
daqerous, especially at the speed 
she walh. 

The other threat to her safe-
guide work: is the distraction of 
other dop, pedestrians and other 
intriguil1l temptations. Hence, if 
you are passing by us at some 
point, I would greatly appreciate it 
(and so will Amaris) if you don't 
pet her without asking me first . 

I must correct her with the leash 
when I notice she is distracted, and

that is not at all pleasant for her or 
for me. 

Likewise, please do not offer her 
food, toys or diversions. 

When working, Amaris expects 
me to praise her every time she 
does something right, which will 
keep her happy and reassure her 
that she 's doing the right thing. 
When she is not in harness, how-
ever, I treat her just like a regular 
pet. 

I can honestly say that Amaris 
has given me a lot more independ-
ence than the white cane ever did. 
Having this much independence 
has long been a dream of mine and 
I am delighted to see it become 
reality.

Of course, the program does not 
rely on magic to function - there 
is no need for that . Each of the 
technicians has extensive compu-
ter experience. 

"Each of my employees must 
provide references which I check 
before hirin,," Griffith said. 

The experience of the students 
gives them a decided edge over a 
new computer user when flgurins 
out new programs and software. 

"Due to the vast variety of soft-
ware available, my students may 
not be familiar with every pro-
gram, .. Griffith said. "But it's easier 
for them to figure out a program, 
than for a new user to do so. The 
department would not be charged 
for the time taken by the tech to 
learn the system; only the time in 
which he I she is training others on 
the system." 

This was the case with Angela 
Hawkins, the management service 
officer of anesthesiololY. who 
used the service. 

"Though the student was not 
familiar with our system, he 
leamed rapidly and was able to 
train approximately 20-2S people. 
He provided useable information, 
and I was very pleased with the 
program." 

The Rent-A-Tech program, 
though not open to students, can 
he contacted by department staff 
through Judi Griffith in the Career 
Services Center at S34-4~. A 
technician will then contact the 
client within two days, usually 
sooner.

dents may have only one personal 
computer account during the year. 
No additional time is available. 
Personal accounts are free to stu-
dents. The SSO weekly account 
balance is only used to control the 
amount oftime students spend on 
the system. 

In addition to personal and 
class accounts, students may also 
obtain laser accounts. A laser 
account allows students to use 
university laser printers. Unlike 
personal and class accounts, stu-
dents must pay for laser printer 
use . The minimum amount 
required to open a laser account is 
S 10. Students will find that the 
university charges much less per 
laser printed page than do outside 
companies. 

The Instructional Account 
Office is located in room 115 I of 
the Applied Physics and Mathe-
matics building. Students may 
apply for seneral campus personal 
student accounts at this office.

have a very detailed understanding 
of the basic biology of how the 
virus infects cell and its whole 
developmental cycle. Very basic 
kinds of research led to that, 
involving a lot of detailed molecu-
lar and cell biology that wasn't 
done specifically for the purpose of 
looking for a cure." 

Posakony defends basic re-
search, often the target of budget 
cuts, as the symbiotic companion 
of clinical research. 

The research at the Posakony 
Lab might be considered science-
for-science's sake, but the knowl-
edge acquired may result in medi-
cal applications and advances in 
biotechnology, such as the engi-
neering of biological products like 
improved cereal crops. 

"The two things are just neces-
sarily allied. A healthy medical 
research effort and endeavor, let's 
say in this country, for example, 
depends on also having concur-
rently a healthy and functioning 

and advancing basic research en-
deavor." 

Posakony is concerned about 
the illusions that people, especially 
aspiring science students, have 
about scientists. 

"Science is a very human and, in 
a lot of ways, imperfect endeavor. 
It's not something that is very cut 
and dry and systematic.~ 

Posakony encour-
ages getting involved 
in research. 

One telling human aspect of the 
lab workers is their quirky sense of 
humor. The fly-Iabbers truly seem 
to have a Far Side view of the 
world.

Brother style. On a door, dozens of

"Humor is based a lot on the

the unexpected as well. So I think 
there's kind of a connection there. 
A sort of openness to the ironic 
and the unusual, the ability to 
appreciate that sort of thing is a 
quality that is really .useful for 
someone who is doing research. ~ 

Posakony said that students 
should try to get a perspective on 
science.

Posakony encourages under-

Craft Center Caters 
to Student Creativity 

The Crafts Center, among the eucalyptus trees, is guarded by its mascot, Stella. 

By JUUE MUNRO 
Features Editor 

I n one of UCSD's eucalyptus groves, tucked between the bustling student center and 
towering, scientific Bonner Hall 
rests the UCSD Crafts Center. 

Thanks to this resource on 
campus, UCSD students do not 
have to kiss good-bye to arts and 
crafts just because they have out-
grown summer camp. 

Since the Crafts Center's incep-
tion, over 15 years ago, it has pro-
vided a creative outlet and a retreat 
from academic stress for students 
and community members. The 
center conducts courses in a 
myriad (If mediums, including 

photography, ceramics, jewelry 
making, and stained glass. 

The Crafts Center shares a 
building with the Grove Caffe, 
the Grove Gallery and the gallery's 
store. According to the center's 
director, Ron Carlson, the com-
plex began as a commuter lounge 
in 1972. 

When "some equipment was 
donated to the University, a [pot-
ter's] wheel and a kiln, thatgotthe 
ball rolling," Carlson said. The 
center evolved into a ceramic 
workshop and, in 1977, branched 
out to what it is today. 

The center's facilities now 
include: the Crafts Center/ Gmve 
Gallery building, a darkroom in 
the Student Center, three gas kilns, 
three electric kilns, a crystal k.i1n , . 
and 20 electric pottery wheels.

The Crafts Center's courses can 

not be taken for credit or for a 
grade. The center charges a min-
imal fee for the various courses, 
which pays for instruction, facili-
ties, and, in some cases, basic 
materials. (There are three fee 
categories - the lowest fee is for 
students, the next up is for faculty, 
staff and alumni, and the hi,hest 
fee is for persons not affihated 
with tJCSD.) 

Carlson explained that the 
University Center pays for the 
administrative costs and staff at 
the center, but classes are paid for 
strictly by the student fees. In this 
way, he pointed out, only the 
popular classes survive. 

The studio manager, Paul lins-
ley, said the center is "presented 
by the students for the students." 
Linsley recommends the courses 
as a way to relieve stress. 

In the academic world, Linsley 
said, "you're pressured to do 
something all the time, you've got 
a class that has to be done at cer-
tain times and you have to have 
grades." 

At the center, students get away 
from stressful schedules. They 
come in and work on projects 
when they choose. The ceramic 
facilities, in fact, are available to 
students 24 hours a day. 

Linsley said a lot of medical 
students spend time at the Crafts 
Center because it is so close to the 
Medical School and because, 
"they work on experiments and 
they don't get to see any progress. 
For months and months they 
don't get to see anything. They 
come in here '" they get total 
gratification from making some-
thing right away." 

Some courses scheduled for fan 
quarter are drawing, silkscreen-
ing T-Shirts, and a Torrey Pines 
needle baskets workshop. (Lins-
ley facetiously apologized that the 
center will not be offering under-
water basket weaving this 
quarter). 

Glass blowing classes will be 
offered winter quarter. They are 
taught at a studio in Leucadia. 

In late November, the Crafts 
Center will cover its western room 
and lawn with students' work for 
one of the center's biannual 
ceramics and glass sales. 

Linsley said the center keeps 25 
percent of the profits and the stu-
dents take home the rest. Last 
year's spring sale grossed over 
S7,000. 

C lasses are kept to a maximum 
of 18 people and run for nine 
weeks , beginning the second week 
of the quarter. Fall quarter's reg-
istration will begin Sept. 27 and 
end Oct. J at the Crafts Center / -
Grove Gallery. Classes begin Oct.3.

Three More Victories Keep 
Men's Soccer Undefeated 

By AC. LEE 
Stoff Writer 

In 1969, Neil Armstrong be-
came the first man to walk on the 
moon as millions of people on 
earth eagerly watched the historic 
moment. 

Today another Armstrong, 
Coach Derek Armstrong, begins 
his walk toward winning UCSD's 
National Championship in men's 
soccer while an average crowd of 
75 fans cheer and suppon the 
team's historic effon. 

Yesterday, the Tritons took 
another step in the right direction 
by recording t heir fifth straight 
shutout and their sixth on the 
year as they edged Cal Poly Pom-
ona , 2-0. The win improves 
UCSD's records to a near-perfect 
7-0-1 and has consequently Im-
proved its Division III national 
ranking from No. 13 to 0. 6. 

Granted, it may be a little early 
to stan thinking national cham-
pionship, but these men are doing 
so well that the breaks are also 
falling their way. Yesterday, Cal 
Poly Pomona had four golden 
scoring opportunities in which it 
could have tied the game at the 
very least, but Triton goalie Brian 
Siljander made a handful of saves 
and Cal Poly shots tended to sail 
wide or even over the goal. 

Junior Scott Goodman scored 
the Tritons' first goal of the game 
only 4:45 after it had started when 
he twisted a corner kick right into 
the net. The game remained 1-0 
until there was only 7: 19 left and 
Scott Rommel scored on a penalty 
kick. 

The victory marked the fourth 
consecutive victory in which 
UCSD has beaten a team whose 
players are receiving athletic 
scholarships. Currently, the Tri-
tons are ranked first in the far 

West region. 
Defense has been the key ena-

bling the Tritons to win their pre-
vious contests, and Friday after-
noon's 3-0 drubbing of Southern 
Cal College was no exception. 
The Triton defense kept the ball 
in Southern Cal territory for 
nearly the whole game, allowing 
only two shots on Siljander. 

Captain and All-American 
hopeful Mike Bradley played an 
outstanding game on defense and 
pointed out that the defense acts 
as a catalyst in bringing the offense 
together. 

His comment seemed to be the 
case when Bradley scored the first 
goal of the game on a feed from 
Craig Gross. The Tritons scored 
again before the half ended when 
a wide open Shahin Alavi scored 
on a pass from Mike Alberts.

appeared picture-perfect as Gross

Aztec Invitational: Final 
Tuneup for Cross Country 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and 
women's cross-country team 
prepared for the important 
UCSD invitational next 
weekend when they competed 
in the 46th annual Aztec Invi-
tational Saturday at San 
Diego State. 

It is still difficult to figure 
how the Tritons will stack up 
with competition more its 
own level (Division I II). Each 
of the last two meets the 
cross-country team has com-
peted in were All-Comers 
meets where Division III 
runners run side by side with 
competitors from Division I 
schools as well as unattached 
runners. 

Saturday's meet was won 

by UCLA, with other schools 
such as Northern Arizona 
and UC Irvine both finishing 
well ahead of the UCSD men 
and women. 

For the women, sophomore 
Denise McFayden was the 
top finisher with an 18:37 
time in the 3K race, which 
earned her 48th place. 
Michelle conlay was the next 
Triton finisher with a time of 
18:48 and Tessie Hanmann 
placed 61st with an 18:51 
time. 

The UCSD men were led 
by Merrell Hora who ran the 
five mile race in 26: 16to gain 
43rd place. Junior Roger 
Webb was the next UCSD 
finisher in 83rd place with a 
27:28 time. 

The freshman team, how-
ever, competed well as they

Unbeatable: Women's Soccer Cruising at 9-0 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

When you add two sensational 
freshmen to a team welcoming 
back all of its players from last 
year's playoff team, you expect to 
see ~n even better team the next 
season. But who would have 
thought the UCSD women's soc-
cer team would be this good? 

This past weekend, the Tritons 
proved that they coud not only 
domjnate in the West as they 

defeated both Rochester Univer-
sity and the State University of 
New York (SUNY) in Stonybrook 
by scores of 5-2 and 3-0, respec-
tively, at the SUNY Stonybrook 
tournament. The two victories 
give Brian McManus' squad a 
sterling 9-0 record and the victory 
over SUNY increases their shut-
out total to seven. 

UCSD was forced to challenge 
the tough University of Rochester 
team in the first game of the tour-
nament, a team claiming the Div-
ision III National Title in each of 

the past two seasons. It certainly 
was not easy tor the Tritons, but 
they managed to pull out a 5-2 
ovenime victory as goals from 
Heather Mauro as well as the 
freshman tandem of Katy Dulock 
and Kalyn Shea in the two 15-
minute ovenimes gave UCSDthe 
victory. ' 

Goals from Dulockand Teresa 
Schwaar were the only two tallies 
the Tritons managed in the first 
half, as the Rochester women 
finally broke through the Triton 
defensive cunain and maintained 

Women's VolleybailDominates Pomona-Pitzer 
Tournament and Now Boasts 20-2 Record 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Stoff Wrirer 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team extended its Division HI 
win streak to 40 matches en route 
to claiming another easy cham-
pio nship at the Pomo na-P itzer

the University of LaVerne 15-5, 
15-10. 

In the semifinals, the Tritons 
walked over CSU San Bernar-
dino 15-10, 15-6. Diana Klint-
worth led the Triton attack with 
seven kills. 

Led by Rachel Vetter's seven 
kills and Klintworth's six, UCSD 
easily beal t he University of 
LaVerne in the tournament fina l.

record to 20 wins and two losses 
- and they remain undefeated 
versus Division III opponents this 
year. It also marked the third

the team has captured this year, 
having already won both the 
Fresno Pacific Invitational and 
the University of LaVerne Invi-

a 2-2 tie after regulation play had 
ended. 

Even though the 5-5 win over 
Rochester halted the consecutive 
shutout streak al six games, the 
Tritons began what could be a 
new streak when they whipped 
the Division I team from Stony-
brook by a 3-0 count. 

Felicia Faro poured in UCSD's 
first goal midway in the first half 
on a penalty shot, but then the 
game remained scoreless until 
there were only 16 minutes left. It 
was here where the Tritons put a 
stop to any thoughts SUNY Stc-
nybrook had about coming back, 
when Dulock scored her 14th 
goal of the year in only nine 
games on a pass from Jennifer 
Kingsbury. 

With only three minutes re-
maining, the Tritons struck again 
as freshmen Amy Wayte scored 
to make it 3-0. UCSD goalie Julie 
Friess played an incredible game 
as she collected five saves, some of 
which were of exceptional value 
on hots where she "robbed" 
S UN Y star forward Donna Al-
bano. Dulock, Faro, and Danielle 
Placek were selected to the AIl-
Tournament tea m. 

The Triton extended 
u treak to Ul 0 

nIh 

poundinl them 7-0. Freshman 
scoring machine Katy Dulock 
poured in four loals while the 
other freshman sensation Kalyn 
Shea added a loal of her own. 
Veterans Felicia Faro and Susan 
Kramer also contribuuted with a 
goal and an assist each as UCSD 
had a field day taking shots on the 
shells hocked Occidental loalie. 

For the day, UCSD took a 
total of 26 shots on goal, while no 
Occidental player was even al-
lowed one shot. The ball tended 
to hover around the Occidental 
goal for virtually the entire game.

The TritoucoUected their fifth 
shutout of the year on Wednea-

day when they began the three-

2-0. Goodman led the UCSD 
offensive attack as he scored the 
fint loal on a corner kick and 
contributed heavily to the Tri-
tons' other loa) near the begin-
ninl of the second half. 

Ahhoup it wu offacially JCOrcd 
by Rommel, the loa) did not 
occur until after Goodman had 
bluted the ball far downfield. 
Carrick Brewster headed Good-
man 'slonl pall to Thien Nsuyen, 
who promptly dished the ball off 
to Rommel who pUlhed it put

The win over Irvine wu es~ 
cially sipificant for UCSD be-
cause the Anteaters compete in 
Division I of the NCAA, and had 
recently lost by one loal to San 
Diego State, last year's Division I 
socc:er champs. 

The men's soccer team will

Even though the UCSD men

CommentarY. 

The Best Athletes 
in the World are 
Not in Seoul 

By W. GALBRAITH 
Contributing Writ" 

Figure this one out: A 
minor league baseball player 
in the United States earns a 
salary of $10,000 a year, yet is 
not eligible to compete in the 
Olympics. Okay, fine. 

But why, then, isa Russian 
basketball player allowed to 
accept a considerable salary 
from the government just to 
train for the games? Sounds 
ridiculous? Well, this hap-
pens. 

The Olympics should show-
case the finest athletes in tbe 
world. Imagine the Laken 
taking on the Soviet Union 
National team. Get serious . 
The Laken could play in 
gravity boots and still win by 
twenty points. Think of Mike 
Tyson matched up against 
the Japanese national champ. 
[ron Mike would knock him 
into the parkinl lot with a 
body blow. 

Okay, maybe I'm exager-
atinl a little. But not mueh. 
Let's face it: compared to 
U oited States athletes, tbe 
rest of the world is soup. 

The Olympic Games, it 
seems have faded from beinl 
the premiere spec:tacle of the 
sporting world tbat they once 
were. Would you rather watch 
the Netherlands grovel with 
Egypt in basketball or view 
an NBA game? [ think the 
answer is obvious. 

The reason that we appear 
inferior to East Germany and 
the Soviet Union in the 
Olympics is because tbose 
lovernments put an equal 
financial emphasis on all 
Olympic events. [n the U.S., 
with the majority of media 
attention givep to the big 
three (professional baseball, 
football, and basketball) 
many kids are drawn to tbese 
sports. 

The kids who are athleti-
cally unable to compete at 
the top level of those sports 
are forced to try otber sports 
if they wisb to compete in 
athletics. They will try scul-
ling, judo, or even Greco-

Romanwrestlingandbeco~ 
"America's Best" at those 
sports. 

You do not fmd pictures of 
Greco-Roman wrestlen on 
tbe trading cards that you 
buy at the five and dime. It's 
baseball playen you find, and 
they're making millions, baby. 

It's not every kid's dream 
to hit tbe bull's eye and win 
the gold medal in archery. 
but ratber to bit a home run 
with the team down by three, 
bases loaded, and a 3-2 count 
in the seventh game of tbe 
world series. 

So before people start 
moaninl and whining that 
the U.S. is slipping far below 
the Soviets, remember it's 
their best taking on our 
second best. And I think we 
still hold our own pretty well. 

To look at it from a differ-
ent penpective, maybe the 
rest of tbe world is lucky that 
we don't unleash our best 
athletes upon them, or tbe 
Olympics would never be the 

sa~.
