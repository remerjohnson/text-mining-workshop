The 2,300 UCSD students who 
were offered a total of $13 million 
in Cal Grants next year may not be 
seeing that money anytime soon.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
newest budget revision attempts 
to partially solve California’s $24 
billion budget 
deficit by elim-
inating over 
$800 million 
in funding to 
the University 
of California, 
as well as cut-
ting all new Cal 
Grant awards 
and halting 
future award 
increases for grant renewals.

According to university spokes-
woman Stacie Spector, 7,300 UCSD 
undergraduates — about one third 
of the UCSD student body — cur-
rently receives about $51 million in 
Cal Grants.

Under Schwarzenegger’s plan, 
these students would be eligible 
to continue to receive the grants, 
though the maximum award would 
not be increased to compensate for 
future UC fee hikes. 

Additionally, a public letter 
released by the California Student Aid 
Commission last Thursday warned 
that Cal Grant offers for next year are 
tentative and subject to final approval 
within the 2009-10 state budget.

Construction of the new Student 
Wellness Center has been indef-
initely postponed due to lack of 
funding for the $40 million project.

Originally scheduled for com-
pletion by the 2011-12 academic 
year, the center is meant to con-
solidate the wellness cluster — an 
interdisciplinary group of student 
services that includes Counseling 
and Psychological Services, Student 
Health Services, the Sexual Assault 
Resource Center and the Campus 
Recreation Center — into one all-
encompassing facility.

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Wellness 
Karen Calfas, the center hopes to 
finance construction with private 
donations. 

“Until we have a substantial 
amount of funding, we can’t even 
start construction,” Calfas said. 
“Since the economy is really strug-
gling, that process is not going along 
at the rate we had anticipated. That 
will get better.”

Calfas and Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue said that 
given the unpredictability of fund-
ing, there is no way to set a comple-

million in donations; 
plans to join all student 
health and wellness

Evicted Student Proves Innocence With Drug Test

Two months after an Earl Warren College stu-dent was evicted from 
his Galbraith Hall apartment 
for an alleged marijuana viola-
tion, a judicial board hearing this 
week cleared him of all charges. 
However, administrators have 
indicated no plans to reinstate 
the student’s residency or issue a 
formal apology for the mistake.

At a May 27 hearing before 
the Warren College Council 
Judicial Board, Warren College 
sophomore Cody Born present-
ed hair follicle and urine tests 
confirming that he had not con-
sumed any illicit substances on 
the night that Residential Security 
Officer Michael Roake accused 
Born and his girlfriend — fellow 
Warren College sophomore Kathy 
Chou — of smoking marijuana in 

Chou’s Douglas Hall apartment. 
Born received the eviction 

notice from Warren College 
Residential Life on March 16 — 
the Monday of finals week — a 
few days after Roake confronted 
Born and Chou at Chou’s apart-
ment. 

Born was given 30 days to 
vacate his residence. 

The two students said they 
were watching a movie in Chou’s 
room on the evening of March 
9 when Roake knocked on the 
apartment door at around 11:30 
p.m. When Chou opened the 
door, Roake claimed to detect the 
odor of burnt marijuana from 
inside the apartment.

According to Born and Chou’s 
write-up notices, Roake also said 
the two students had bloodshot 
eyes and flushed faces.

Born and Chou both denied 
the accusations, and after the pair 
received write-up notices two 
days later, Born met with Warren 
College Assistant Residential 
Dean Cesar Figueroa to discuss 
the incident. Figueroa allegedly 
told Born — who, at the time, 
was on nonacademic probation 
for an unrelated alcohol violation 
that had occurred several months 
earlier — that there was a good 
chance he would be evicted from 
his apartment. 

“At first I thought that it was 
just a misunderstanding,” Born

UC President Mark G. Yudof will 
make a 5 percent reduction to his 
annual salary next month, along with 
the salaries of all UC chancellors and 
other top executives, in response to 
deep systemwide budget reductions.

The pay cut, which was announced 
in an internal letter from Yudof last 
week, will shave less than $1 million 

from the salaries of about 30 senior 
administrators, including executive 
and senior vice presidents, execu-
tive vice chancellors and the General 
Counsel (which provides legal ser-
vices to the 10-campus system). 

“Admittedly, this action does not 
have a significant impact on our very 
serious budget deficit, given its mag-
nitude and the fact that UC’s senior 
management group comprises only 
a very small fraction of university 
employees,” Yudof said in the letter. 
“Given the magnitude of the budget 
shortfall, all options need to be con-
sidered, and unfortunately, it is likely 
that every member of the UC com-
munity will be affected negatively.”

See REGENTS��page 3

About 30 UC executives, 
including senior admin., 
will take pay cuts totalling 
almost $1 million to help 
fill $531 million deficit.

By eliminating all new Cal 
Grants, which have already been 
tentatively offered to 80,000 stu-
dents statewide, the state would save 
an estimated $173 million in 2009-
10 and $450 million in 2010-11.

Spector said that if the Legislature 
approves the cuts, the university 
would attempt to spread the impacts 
evenly throughout the student pop-
ulation, decreasing the amount of 
financial aid received by all students 
and “significantly increasing the 
amount that financial-aid students 
would be expected to work and bor-
row.” 

Spector added that financial-aid 
award packages would likely show 
an increase in private loans and a 
growth in unsubsidized PLUS loans.

“We encourage students to bud-
get wisely and make good decisions 
in regard to discretionary spend-
ing,” Spector said. “Additionally, we 
would anticipate that students may 
opt to work more to help meet costs 
… [They] will also have to manage 
work and study time to maintain 
good academic standing and gradu-
ate in a timely manner.”

For some students, though, extra 
shifts at the dining hall won’t be 
enough to fill the gap left by the 
elimination of the Cal Grant pro-
gram.

“I have no parents supporting 
me through college,” Muir College 
freshman Alexandra Chwalik said. 
“Financial aid is the only thing get-
ting me here, and if Cal Grants were 
cut, I would have to take a year off 
of school to work full-time.”

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West expressed 
the same concern.

“If these May revision propos-
als pass, I do not know how myself 
and countless others who depend 
on the Cal Grant will be retained 
at the university,” West said. “As a 
low-income, first-generation college 
student, the detrimental cuts to the 
Cal Grant will place me at a greater 
disadvantage.”

On Monday, UC President Mark 
G. Yudof asked the Joint Legislative 
Conference Committee to reject  
Schwarzenegger’s proposal, describ-
ing the devastating impact that the 
$800 million in budget cuts would 
have on the university.

He said the cuts would force the 
university to further reduce fresh-
man enrollment, revisit fee increas-
es for the 2009-10 academic year 
and implement more furloughs, lay-
offs and salary reductions.

“The effect on families under 
$60,000 is really unbelievable,” 
Yudof said in a statement. “I think 
everything’s going to suffer, but any-
thing we put off, like fixing a leaky 
roof, to keep the basic instructional 
staff in place and allow students to 
graduate on time … [is what] we’re 
going to be working hardest to pre-
serve, and that has to be the highest 
priority.”

Yudof said that students and 
their families need to be given more 
notice before cuts of this severity 
are passed. 

“The long-term solution for our 
economy is to heighten investment 
in UC, the CSU and the community 
colleges,” Yudof said. “In the near 
term, unfortunately, the utter sever-
ity of the cuts proposed leaves us 
only difficult options to consider.”

The final A.S. Council meet-ing of the year was looked a bit too much like budget 
meeting part deux, as the coun-
cil was reminded of budget and 
funding concerns throughout the 
evening. 

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Ed Spriggs gave a 
rather depressing special presen-
tation on the reductions that the 
university - particularly the Student 
Affairs office - faces in the upcom-
ing 2009-10 academic year. 

N e x t , 
T h u r g o o d 
Marshall College 
senior Sun 
Won “Scooter” 
Chung and Sixth 
College junior 
C h r i s t o p h e r 
Datilles lead a presentation detail-
ing the various successes of the 
two-year old Students Promoted 
Access Center for Education and 
Service programs. They also pre-
sented the S.P.A.C.E.S. budget for 
the next academic year.

“Our mission is not to create 
these programs for the sake of 
creating programs, our mission is 
to support access and retention,” 
Chung said. “This is really a center 
that works on the holistic idea of 
improving students’ lives.” 

Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy shared the results of his 
White Board Experiment, during 
which he sat on Library Walk with 
a whiteboard last week to collect 
student input and make A.S. more 
visible.  

Student feedback included: 
thumbs up for baby Sun Gods and 
other smaller-scale events that 
promote campus involvement and 
sociability; thumbs down for the 
Justice For All displays; more ‘S’ 

parking spots; and knowledge of 
when and where the A.S. meetings 
take place each week. 

An idea for a likely ongoing 
senator project that resulted from 
Kenworthy’s experiment is a phone 
line that would direct students to 
a voicemail listing the different 
events taking place throughout the 
week. The line would be updated by 
senators on a daily basis. 

The S.P.A.C.E.S. staff did not 
agree with all of the council revi-
sions to its charter, so stay tuned 

next year for pos-
sible changes to 
the charter. 

After approv-
ing a slew of 
funding requests, 
the coun-
cil approved 

the 2009-10 budget for the 
Sustainability Resource Center, 
before revisiting the topic of the 
criteria for Mandated Reserves, 
which had been tabled last week. 
After some deliberation, the council 
determined that the criteria would 
remain the same. 

Then, it seemed as though 
everyone and their moms tried 
to get items into New Business. 
S.P.A.C.E.S. directors and 
Revelle College Senator Arvind 
Satyanarayan were all appointed 
with little drama. 

Vice President of External 
Affairs Gracelynne West attempt-
ed to submit two resolutions into 
New Business around the time that 
the lights went out in the forum. 
The meeting continued in semi-
darkness for about half an hour 
before Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Jordan Taylor 
humanely made a motion to dis-
charge the resolutions to commit-
tee, putting an end to the evening.

UC Berkeley has already laid off 
over 80 employees since the begin-
ning of the year, and UCSD is slow-
ly moving in the same direction. 
according to UCSD spokeswoman 
Stacie Spector.

“We have had some layoffs in the 
last few months and expect more in 
the next couple of months,” Spector 
said in a statement.

Yudof ’s letter arrives on the 
heels of a legislative proposal draft-
ed by State Senators Leland Yee 
(D-San Francisco/San Mateo) and 
Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield) last 
Wednesday to strip the university of 
immunity from legislative control. 
The senators cited recent pay hikes 
for UC executives as one of the rea-
sons they introduced the measure. 

Yee, however, said the executive 
pay cut is too little, too late. 

“We still need to move forward 
with a ballot measure that will rein 
them in,” Yee said in a statement. “We 
already have people who are being 
furloughed, who are taking pay cuts, 
and [the University of California] 
should have led the way a long time 
ago.”

UC chancellors receive an aver-
age salary of $312,400 a year, and 
Yudof earns a base salary of $591,000 
annually. 

Before the 5 percent cuts, UCSD 
Chancellor Marye Ann Fox received 
$382,416 a year. 

Released late last month, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s revised bud-
get includes a $1.5 billion cut to high-
er education, $531 million of which 
would come from the UC system.

Dear Editor,
In light of the May 31 federal 

court ruling prohibiting the dispersal 
of the harbor seal colony from Casa 
Beach, I would like to encourage 
the UCSD community to express its 
support of the seals’ right to stay 
at their longtime home in La Jolla. 
Last week Superior Court Judge Yuri 
Hoffman ruled for the removal of the 
seals to create a children’s bathing 
pool, demonstrating the unfortunate 

tendency to place relatively unim-
portant human interests above the 
survival needs of another species. 
Deb Saracini of the La Jolla Friends of 
the Seals, a public awareness and seal 
advocacy group, told me that the har-
bor seals — whose community now 
numbers about 200 — have lived here 
since at least the 19th century. She 
explained that if the seals were forced 
off the beach, they would lose their 
place to rest on dry land — which is 
necessary to their survival, especially 
that of the 46 baby seals. 

Now, thanks to the federal court 
ruling, a restraining order to protect 

the seals is in effect. They will not be 
“dispersed” by recorded dog barking 
noises (the originally proposed plan). 
The restraining order is part of a 
bill currently awaiting hearing in the 
State Assembly which would leave the 
City Council to decide the seals’ fate. 
Only councilmember Sherri Lightner 
favors the dispersion of the seals. We 
are lucky to have such spectacular 
wildlife right here in La Jolla. Being 
able to view these wild animals live 
and play in their natural habitat is 
a privilege of which we should all 
take advantage. Please express your 
approval of protecting the seals by 

e-mailing members of the San Diego 
City Council and telling them how 
you feel.

When discussing stu-dent rights, it’s easy to get caught in the flow-
ery rhetoric of concepts like justice, 
equal representation and a slew of 
other democratic buzzwords that 
look damn good on picket signs, 
T-shirts and campaign buttons. 

It’s rare, though, that students get 
the opportunity to feel the burn of 
disenfranchisement. Generally, we’re 
afforded more rights than we even 
know. 

Yet a prime example of injustice 
— real life, stripped-of-your-rights, 
kicked-to-the-curb injustice — has 
been right underneath our noses 
since each of us began our college 
careers here at UCSD. The source: 
our campus housing contract.

Amid four pages of waivers, 
guidelines, regulations and notices, 
the contract contains a single line 
that allows the university to evict its 
campus tenants at any time without 
any formal reason. 

By agreeing to the contract, stu-
dents effectively sign away their 
rights to due process, bestowing 
upon the university complete con-
trol over the status of their residency. 

In a perfect world — where 
administrative mistakes and the 
behavioral shortcomings of bloated 
residential officials are nonexistent 
— this arrangement wouldn’t be too 
troubling. 

Yet administrators make mis-
takes, and sometimes they even — 

gasp! — abuse their power. 
Just last quarter, a student 

was evicted from his Earl Warren 
College apartment based solely 
on the testimony of a Residential 
Security Officer, who claimed the 
student displayed symptoms of mar-
ijuana consumption in an exchange 
between the two. 

At a judicial-board hearing two 
months after his removal from cam-
pus, the student presented drug tests 
proving that he had not engaged in 
the use of any illicit substances. 

It would require a unique stub-
bornness to claim that this incident 
doesn’t indicate a flaw in our hous-
ing system’s infrastructure. Students 

are being evicted without the oppor-
tunity to defend themselves and 
punished without any proof of mis-
conduct.

It doesn’t end there. Write-ups are 
issued based on the same principles: 
convict first, ask questions never. 
And when questions are asked, it’s 
usually too late — as in the case of 
the aforementioned Warren College 
student.

Th is contract must be thoroughly 
reexamined. 

Students deserve the right to 
defend themselves against charges 
that harm their reputations and our 
administrators should be obligated 
to provide this right.

If there’s one thing our iso-lated campus is good for, it’s ignoring the nitty-gritty of the 
real world and drifting off in our 
dreamy collegiate paradise. After 
all, when the only real effects of 
California’s tanking economy visible 
to students are reduced hours at the 
UCSD Bookstore, it’s easy to forget 
the whole billion-dollar state deficit 
thing.

But now that Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger has released a 
budget that will burn a $531 mil-
lion dollar-hole in the University of 
California’s 2009-10 budget, our cozy 
four-year bubbles are finally threat-
ening to burst.

Come fall, when we’re freed from 
our coffee-fetching intern duties to 
make the trek back to UCSD, our 
academic instruction — not to men-
tion practically every other useful 
service or program on campus — 
will be undeniably impacted.

UC President Mark G. Yudof said 
it himself. Schwarzenegger’s budget 
will force the university to raise stu-
dent fees, increase class sizes and cut 
academic offerings.

Your professors will feel it too 

— pay cuts and furloughs for UC 
employees are by no means out of 
the question.

Though major cut decisions will 
have to wait until specifics trickle 
down from the powers that be over 
the next couple of months, some 
departments have already decided 
to shrink class offerings for the 

Summer Sessions and Fall Quarter. 
The Division of Arts and Humanities 
— which relies less on private grants 
than other departments — will 
endure an exceptionally painful bud-
getary burn, and classes with lower 
enrollment (such as language cours-
es) will be especially vulnerable to 
the chopping block.

Until a serious game of telephone 
goes down between Yudof, the UC 
campus chancellors, the academic 
divisions and their departments, the 
severity of the cuts are uncertain. 
But one thing’s for sure: no matter 
how many eucalyptus trees you duck 
under, next year there’s no avoiding 
the apocalypse.

As student fees rise and the American job market crum-bles, it’s easy for environmen-
tal issues to take a backseat in the 
average Triton’s daily routine. But 
fortunately, we can tackle both our 
financial and environmental wor-
ries through everyday conservation 
methods. Individually speaking, the 
behavioral changes are small, but 
when a larger body — such as the 
UCSD community — adopts them, 
they add up. The adjustments I’ve 
made can both fatten your wallet 
and give you a clean environmental 

conscience.
My methods include:
1) Lowering my energy bill by 

conserving energy. Turn off your 
power strip or unplug your cell phone 
and laptop chargers when you’re not 
using them to prevent phantom loads 
(energy consumed when the power 
is turned off). According to the U.S. 
Department of Energy, 75 percent of 
the electricity used to power home 
electronics is consumed while they 
are turned off.

To maximize savings with a 
laptop, put your AC adapter on a 
power strip that can be turned off; 
the transformer in the AC adapter 
draws power continuously, even if the 
laptop is not plugged into the adapter.

If you don’t have them yet, get 
compact fluorescent light bulbs. 
According to Energy Star, a gov-
ernment-backed program that rates 
energy efficiency, a CFL will save 
about $30 over its lifetime and pay 
for itself in about six months. It uses 
75 percent less energy and lasts about 
10 times longer than an incandescent 
bulb.

2) Conserving water — San Diego 
imports 90 percent of its water from 
the Colorado River and Northern 
California. Start by turning off the 
tap when you’re washing dishes or 
soaping up in the shower. And turn 
off the water when you’re brushing 
your teeth or scrubbing your hands. 
According to the San Diego Water 
Authority, it saves about three gallons 
per day.

3) Disposing of bottled water and 
replacing it with a reusable water 
bottle and tap water (or filtered tap 
water). Though a 16-ounce bottle of 
water costs about $1, you can get the 
same amount in tap water for a few 
pennies.

4) Checking my tire pressure. The 
higher it is, the better fuel mileage 
you’ll see — meaning fewer fill-ups 
and more money in your pocket. 
You can also improve mileage by 
clearing out the junk in your trunk, 
because a heavier load leads to lower 
gas mileage. Consuming less gas also 
reduces air pollution (20.8 pounds of 
carbon dioxide are emitted into the 
atmosphere for every gallon of fuel 
consumed). 

Whether financial or environ-
mental, we’re all part of a commu-
nity using the same pool of resources. 
Acknowledging that we have limited 
supplies enables us to consume more 
responsibly while both preserving the 
environment and saving our hard-
earned cash.

We have yet to deal with it in an open and honest way. Every time there’s a 
budget shortfall, the student-fee increase is on the table. We have no choice 
but to raise fees and we sit around, wring our hands and worry about it. I 
don’t think the response ought to be just increase fees and nothing more 
and hope next year will be better. We look at this every year as unique, but 
it’s not unique. Are we giving up on affordability and accessibility?”

said. “I e-mailed Cesar and said, ‘It’s 
just a mistake, right? This is going 
to be taken off? I asked him a bunch 
of questions and he just said ‘No, 
this eviction notice is final, there’s 
nothing I can do about it.’ That’s all 
he said.”

Born attempted to take the 
question up with Warren College 
Residential Dean Claire Palmer. 
However, when he met with Palmer, 
she told him the decision to terminate 
his tenancy would stand.

“She was kind of sympathetic 
toward me,” Born said. “She was like, 
‘Yeah, I’m really upset about this, too, 
but there’s nothing we can do about it.’ 
I was kind of shocked that there are no 
checks and balances. Just because one 
guy is power-tripping, now nobody 
else can fix what his mistake is. I just 
don’t see how that’s right.” 

Additionally, Chou’s roommate 
signed a statement claiming responsi-
bility for the marijuana odor. She said 
that Born and Chou should be cleared 
of any charges.

“Someone actually stepped for-
ward and took responsibility for 
everything that that happened that 
night,” Chou said. 

Despite Chou’s roommate’s tes-
timony, Figueroa told Chou and 
Born that the citations would not be 
revoked.

After opting to appeal the decision, Born and Chou underwent hair-follicle and 
urine tests to prove their innocence. 
According to medical records pro-
vided by the pair, the results of 
the tests came back negative, con-
firming that Born and Chou had 
not consumed marijuana on the 
night that Roake confronted them 
at Chou’s apartment.

Born said he spent over $100 on 
the two tests. The hair-follicle test 
that Born took is regularly used by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation 

and can detect any marajuana con-
sumption that has occurred in the 
three months prior to the test. 

“I specifically went to the drug 
testing place and asked them, ‘What 
is going to prove that I’m innocent?’” 
Born said.

According to the WCC Judicial 
Board’s record of Born’s case, Warren 
College Assistant Residential Dean 
Sean McCarty attended Born’s hear-
ing last week, acting as UCSD’s rep-
resentative and the complainant in 
the case. 

McCarty — who at the time of 
the hearing was unaware that Born 
had undergone the two drug tests 
— accused Born of being under the 
influence of marijuana on the night 
he and Chou were written up by 
Roake. 

Later in the hearing, Roake — also 
unaware of Born’s drug tests — fur-
ther alleged that Born’s breath had 
smelled of marijuana during their 
March 9 encounter. This detail was 
not included in the write-up that 
Roake submitted on March 14 regard-
ing the incident.

“What’s funny is that he didn’t 
know I had the drug test taken,” Born 
said. “So it’s kind of like he’s just try-
ing to go along with the stories and 
kind of make up more just to ensure 
that I’m held responsible, that I’m 
guilty.”

After A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Student Advocacy Frank 
Carroll —who was acting as Born’s 
representative — produced the drug 
test results, McCarty questioned their 
validity.

“He said that the urine test had 
too much variance,” Chou said. “Then 
Cody said, ‘Well, I have a hair test.’ For 
the hair test, he questioned how he 
could tell it was really Cody’s hair in 
the sample.”

Later in the trial, McCarty 
changed his position to claim that 
Born may have been a guilty party 
despite not having consumed any 

illicit substances.
“At the very end of the hearing he 

resorted to saying, ‘Oh, I’m not try-
ing to say that Cody smoked weed,’” 
Chou said. “He said it could be pos-
sible that Cody was aiding someone 
in smoking weed or he was just about 
to light up. They just kind of pointed 
at a bunch of other things that had 
nothing to do with what they were 
charging him with, because the drug 
test pretty much proved that he didn’t 
do anything.”

Born was officially charged for 
violations of the controlled substanc-

es agreement contained in section 
22.16.10.30 of the UCSD Student 
Conduct Regulations and the resi-
dential smoking policy within section 
22.16.10.16 of the same document. 

Though the violations were 
removed from his record, the uni-
versity refuses to reinstate Born’s resi-
dency.

The housing contract all UCSD students sign when moving onto campus contains a clause 
that allows the university to termi-
nate a student’s tenancy at any time, 
without cause, provided the student 
is allowed 30 days to vacate the resi-

dence. 
The contract also gives the univer-

sity the right to terminate a student’s 
residency with only three days’ notice 
“under any circumstances allowed by 
law.”

“That termination has nothing 
to do with whether or not the stu-
dent actually did anything,” Student 
Legal Services attorney Jon Carlos 
Senour said. “That’s really the issue. 
… Because of the fact that the lan-
guage doesn’t require finding a viola-
tion of the legal code, legally speaking 
it’s OK.”

Senour said this type of arrange-
ment is common in most tenant-land-
lord relationships within the commer-
cial housing sector.

“The one concern that students 
typically have is that obviously 
there’s an unequal bargaining power 
between the student and the univer-
sity,” Senour said.

Born said the contract should be 
altered to require more investigation 
into the circumstances surrounding a 
student’s eviction.

“It shouldn’t be up to just one 
person, one person’s opinion, wheth-
er you’re guilty or not, whether you 
should be evicted or not,” Born said.

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Frank Carroll said 
students should be entitled to a fair 
hearing before being evicted.

“There’s no due process,” Carroll 
said. “In our system of values and 
our system of justice, the idea that 
you can get kicked out before you’re 
even given an opportunity to have 
your case heard makes no sense. 
Everything in the student conduct 
code and the housing contract 
should be based on a presumption 
of innocence. That’s a fundamental 
value in the whole American system 
of justice.”

A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena — who himself was evicted 
from his Warren College apartment 
in April — said Born’s case indicates 

a fundamental flaw in the campus 
housing contract.

“There are no ifs, ands or buts,” he 
said. “There’s nothing in this contract 
that requires the university to prove 
anything; it just says the university 
can terminate this contract. What that 
essentially allows for is punishment 
without due process.”

During his bid for a senatorial 
position on the A.S. Council this 
spring, Pena promised to work toward 
a more just housing contract for stu-
dents. He said he will use Born’s case 
as a starting point for this effort. 

“This is a landmark in our fight for 
student rights,” he said. “It shows that 
this is a flawed system that allows for 
unjust punishment.”

However, Associate Director of 
Housing Services Jana Severson said 
the contract is fair in its current form.

“A contract is a contract,” she 
said. “It allows for a series of [condi-
tions] that either can be broken by 
the university or by the resident. … 
Our contracts are fairly standard in 
landlord-tenant law … so I think the 
contract stands as a document and 
serves well.”

Carroll said the university should 
attempt to foster a better relationship 
with students than one based solely 
on contractual obligation.

“You need to have it one way or 
another,” Carroll said. “If you’re going 
to be a landlord, then get the RAs out 
of there, get the RSOs out of there, 
and start trusting people to abide by 
the code of conduct. If you’re going 
to be a parent … then you need to 
start acting that way. ... You’ve got 
people transitioning from structured 
life to independent life … It needs 
to be better than a landlord-tenant 
relationship, because it’s a relation-
ship of student and their institution, 
their school.”

Director of Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs Tony Valladolid said

SOAPBOX 
TRADITION

TAKES A TURN 
FOR THE FUNK 
I fear I have brought great shame upon my ancestors.Traditionally, the Guardian’s 
incoming editor in chief taps out a 
hello/goodbye piece for the strictly 
annual “Editor’s Soapbox” fixture in 
the second-to-last issue of the year, an 

indulgent little guy which everyone 
scans for shout-outs and promptly dis-
regards along with the rest of the Focus 
section (sorry Dave).

Of course, being the shackle-bust-
ing rebel I’ve always been — and seeing 
that I somehow missed the parting 
thunderclouds and completely forgot 
until last night that this sacred torch-
passing ritual existed, and was in fact 
now mine to uphold — my bastardly 
arts-and-entertainment column will 
have to bend its wet ‘n’ wild all-things-
artsy theme to pick up the pieces.

I guess it’s time to admit that 
“Straighter Than Narrow” never really 
had a theme. The first installment was 
more an excuse to cry about losing 
all my music in an external-hard-drive 
catastrophe, alongside a review of a 
John Lennon documentary in which 
I accidentally switched the last names 
of two very important and very hip 
historical figures who will now remain 
unnamed, lest I screw it up again and 
tally a strike two upon their angry

CONCERT PREVIEWS
SUMMER
INDEPENDENCE JAM
FM 94/9

Y eah Yeah Yeahs, Metric, Black Keys and Dead Confederate — all for $30. Say no more. In no place but San Diego and the smallest of desert 
towns could you stumble across a better lineup for a 
few bucks and a handful of change. As flagships of the 
indie scene, each headlining act is known for infectious 
live performance and full-throttle soul dug deep from 
garage-band beginnings. 

YYY, in particular, pretty much seal the deal: the NY 
trio’s latest album, It’s Blitz!, garnered four-star reviews 
across the board and earned major cred for its sensual, 
introspective dance jams set to Karen O’s glam theatrics. 
Metric — promoting their own pitch-perfect Fantasies 
— make a steamy appetizer, busting out a serving of synth-
pop gently soothed by Emily Haines’ crystalline larynx. 
Throw in the bluesy Black Keys and down-home grungers 
Dead Confederate, and you’ve got a bona fide good time. If 
you’re heading to the sold-out show, bring your whole fam-
ily — little ones under three get their music education free. 

FM 94/9 Independence Jam: Coastal Invasion will be 
held at the Oceanside Pier Amphitheater on June 7.

(PROM)ISCUOUS
with Zion I & LAZRtag

CURE NOONTIME BOREDOM WITH NIGHTS OF PUNK POWER CHORDS, LO-FI FOLK AND SOME SWEET PIANO KEYS TO SUGAR YOUR LEMONADE

K ick up your heels and shine them shoes — A.S. is set to round out the year with (insert eyeroll) Senior PROMiscuous. Featuring 
“City of Dope” hero Zion I and lesser-known 
LAZRtag as openers, the campus dance party 
PROMises to be, according to the PEG booklet, 
“that prom you saw in corny teen movies and never 
had.” Silver tinsel, screechy cheerleaders and horny 
jocks? Oh, boy. 

At least Zion I’s slick rhymes and mashup-
military synths burn a brand that’s a little more 
legit. The same can’t be said for the LAZRtag team, 
a house duo as generic as apple pie. Too bad we 
could only afford Girl Talk once. Expect club beats, 
bubble dresses and a whole lotta underage fresh-
meat — if that’s your thing. 

But hey, even if it’s a bit of a limp hand-
shake for soon-to-be alumni, it’s an honest 
effort. Just tag it as a free pre-party for 
finals week, wander on over from the pub 

and get down with your bad side. Next 
week, you can hold your own keg stand.

PROMiscuous will be held at the 
Price Center West Ballroom on June 4.

GRIZZLY BEAR
■ 21st Century Breakdown
REPRISE

I f the little-known genre of steam-punk were as cool as I want it to be — not the medio-cre goth sect it is in real Wikipedia life — 
if steam-punk’s telescopes, time machines and 
open-gear compasses were rubbed with varnish 
and made to glint, the whole scene would belong 
only to Grizzly Bear.

It’s painful to group the Brooklyn quartet 
with the lately overcrowded indie-rock circle of 
church-choir atmospheraholics like Fleet Foxes, 
My Morning Jacket and Bon Iver — though 
they do have plenty of that going on. But where 
Daniel Rossen’s lead vocals may at first seem to 
reverberate like the rest, they are in fact cupped 
and drop-shadowed in the sliver of a bandmate’s 
own rising solo. Discipline and restraint lend an 
inner metal-weight to the band’s antique varnish, 
setting them apart from nervous classmates who 
do gypsy impressions whenever things get slow.

All slowness aside, Grizzly Bear have a new 
nonproblem with likeability. The more nuanced 
and intricate they grow as musicians, the more 
accessible the sum of their parts. If you’re will-
ing to re-imagine your wildest dreams at their 
excruciating pace, there’s no avoiding an addic-
tion to the sparser heartbeat of a perfect machine 
— blooping and churning without a single unin-
tentional groan of wear. The men behind the 
machine, of course, are blistering their fingers 
with tiny gears to keep the beat square and punky 

while preserving the 
steam in the crannies of 
the stained-glass Mother Mary above.

Fortunately, Veckatimest gets its most pain-
fully gorgeous moments over with early on. 
Second-track single “Two Weeks” enters coyly 
on Devotchka piano toes, one grumpy bass 
striking a beat that never warms, bruising a 
boardroom finger-tap that zips across a choice 
chunk of keyboard to lend the song its entire 
sense of orbit. Drizzle on the merciless altar-boy 
peels of Rossen, and the grounded bass and 
pebbly drums are lifted to the slightest of hovers 
— one we’d rather break than bear its prettiness. 

The majority of Veckatimest’s remainder 
is stocked with awkward, seemingly free-jazz 
moments that plod to a formula we have no 
chance of pinning, every other track an “I’ve 
Just Seen a Face” to keep us from suffocating 
on the “Yesterday”s. 

That compositions so embellished in cymbal, 
so hung in light and tinsel, and with a soul to their 
swirl that rivals Shuggie Otis, can still feel so first-
man essential — a single drop of African sweat — 
is a barely-there fruit of the greatest labor.

Grizzly Bear will perform live in Los Angeles 
at the Wiltern on June 19.

RISE AGAINST
S elf-proclaimed hardcore kids Rise Against have already proven they can throw a kick-ass lawn party — they shared Warped’s 
main stage with punk revivalists Billy Talent in 
’06, and raged with Alkaline Trio before that. Now 
returning alongside Talent and veteran screamers 
Rancid on July 10, we can expect the same string-
shredding crunch that made Rise boss on 2006’s 
The Sufferer & the Witness. 

Fair warning: The PETA-loving, anti-estab-
lishment vegans preach and pout about as much 
as they actually play. But when they do get down 
to business, they skid close to Bad Religion’s 
skater genius with no shortage of cymbal crash-

es and amp-rattling power chords. Vocalist Tim 
McIlrath has a beaten-raw voice, and stadium 
choruses chuck any tacit pretention straight into 
the mosh pit. 

Are they the best in the business? Probably not 
— overbrushed Appeal to Reason lacks the depth 
that made Sufferer so beautifully plaintive, and 
some tracks are barely discernible. Still, a night of 
sweaty, animalistic thrashing is worth 35 bucks. 

Rise Against will perform live at the San 
Diego Sports Arena on July 10.

O h, come on. You know Coldplay. “Viva la Vida” of iTunes-exclusive fame? You’ve heard “Yellow,” like, at least 43 times. The 
“alternative” Brit band won the Grammy this 
year for best rock album and snagged the No. 1 
Billboard spot in 2008, despite lukewarm critical 
reviews. And with millions of hysterical fans per-
petually at their feet, it makes sense: Their polite 
yet soaring piano rock (not to mention dreamy 
frontman Chris Martin) makes for a bloody bril-
liant commercial sensation.

Plus, Coldplay’s concerts tend to be a lot like 
Death Cab’s recent surprisingly rockin’ RIMAC 
show. Lush tracks like “The Scientist” unfold 
seizure-inducing lightshows and show-stopping 
gimmicks. Word is, they’ve got confetti butter-
flies. Tons.

Coldplay will perform live at the Cricket 
Wireless Amphitheatre in Chula Vista on July 16.

COLDPLAYGREEN
DAY

H eads up, losers: At a cou-ple secret shows in San Francisco, Green Day pre-
viewed their upcoming tour, play-
ing recent rock opera 21st Century 
Breakdown in its entirety — all 
three epic acts and 18 tracks, from 
start to finish. Any other band near-
ing mid-life crisis might crash and 
burn in dusty glory, but let’s face it: 
Green Day — even with guyliner 
— kick ass. 

They’ve come a long way. 
Pot-smoking “green days” at 
Berkeley and masturbation 
anthems have been treated with 
politically charged variants on 
the Bush-bashing theme. The 
latest streamlined ditties aren’t 
quite Rage Against the Machine, 
but they pack enough punk to 
satisfy enthusiasts. And with 
tracks like “East Jesus Nowhere” 
— decidedly riotous celebrations 
of Bible-bashing — lead sing-
er Billie Joe Armstrong packs 
enough controversy to fuel a 
pumped-up performance. Add 
a killer mosh pit, a hormonally 
charged crowd and a few whiffs 
of Mary Jane, and you’re set to 
thrash out the night. 

Green Day will perform live at 
the Cox Arena on August 20.

graves. Alas, that is the kind of shame 
that amasses when a ditzy and undeserving 
sophomore, still working through the kinks 
of her humble hip-hop writing — rather 
hilariously, considering her nonexistent 
background in rapping/being black or poor 
— gets ditched by a dashing graduating staff 
of aspiring Lester Bangses. Boo.

Then there was the bedazzled install-
ment about the great, empty cultureless-
ness of Las Vegas, in which I reflected 
on the Guardian’s annual weekend of 
sin. Pleasant in theory, until I was struck 
with my 1 a.m. Hiatus-diety obligation to 
spiral into a cussy, big-headed lecture on 
how the Roots are awesome guys with big 
souls and therefore don’t belong perform-
ing in such a soulless pit as Vegas.

OK, most embarrassing moment in 
“Straighter Than Narrow” history: the one 
in which I already said goodbye. There 
is no awkwardness like that of kissing 
everyone in the room a tearful farewell 
— maybe even squeezing a butt cheek 
and admitting you always had a thing 
for them, because you only live once and 
there’s no time like the present — and then 
having to slink back momentarily because 
you forgot your car keys. Especially when 
you catch them all talking shit.

Anyway, I left in a huff at the dawn of 
2008, one year and a quarter into my reign 
as Hiatus editor. Upon not being able to 
recall a single thing I had learned in any 
class or done outside the Guardian office — 
like, hm, get laid while I still had elastic skin 
cells and a spine that could straighten after 
24 hours in a chair, maybe sometime before 
the fluorescents shriveled me into an old 
wrinkled kelp with nothing but my muffy 
comfort-headphones for protection — I 
decided to get the hell out.

Now, apparently, I’m back, far from 
being able to pretend it’s my “basket-weav-
ing” major that’s keeping me here an entire 
fifth year, once again bidding my goodbye to 
the current staff (and to gloomy-ass spring 
quarter, damn it all). Even though there’s a 
whole year left — one that looks to be Cal 
Grant free, woopee, even less bank to feed 

my parking-ticket addiction — it’s definitely 
the end of an era. But hello as well, to all you 
who’ll be around next year to grudgingly 
peruse our mandatory college publication, 
our foldable path-lining literature to test 
against your own wits and educated guesses. 

To stick with at least one tradition, 
I’ll wind this end-of-the-year tissue into 
something (albeit sort of shoddily) enter-
tainment related: My very own dedication 
’graph, FM-style, to all those who have 
led me to where I am today. Consider me 
Delilah if she hadn’t found God.

Chuck Berry to Pop, Graceland to Mom 
on the Indian rug. “Just a Girl” to elemen-
tary school, where I lip-synched it in the 
talent show and realized I had no talent, but 
learned how to love myself some goddamn 
Gwen Stefani. It pains me to say a guy got 
me into hip-hop, and pretty much strips 
me of all street cred (you know, the kind 
I’ve been building at this esteemed institu-
tion), but Nick was it. So “Strawberry” to 
Nick, and all that silly Brother Ali shit too. 
We were cute. My freshman-year dungeon 
was no place for dance party, so fifth-year 
Knife to Sari and Melody, because it was 
to “Heartbeats” on the room’s single floppy 
chair that I learned to dance party. Then 
“She’s having a baby,” to be funny. “Give the 
Drummer Some” to Cody, my first editor, 
and maybe “Strawberry 23,” because for 
the entire world of songs you showed me, it 
felt good to give a couple back. “What You 
Know” to Charles, best managing editor 
ever to touch my reads, an Asian duckling 
born in the ATL in another life. “La Lata” 
to Felipe, who I landed on when I fled to 
Latin America and who still keeps me sane 
on Skype with all the newest and dirti-
est cumbia, and “La Dueña del Swing” to 
Sebastian, the only guy I’ve ever wanted 
to dance with. And to next year’s staff, my 
beautiful little kumquats — I won’t tell you 
your dedication until we go to fucking 
Asian karaoke already.

Sucks. I guess now that I’m editor, there’s 
no one left in the uppermost hierarchal 
rung to prevent me from dedication ’graphs 
like the motherload above. Alyssa and Reza, 
it’s up to you: Please, hold me back.

Marilyn Manson
■ The High End of Low
INTERSCOPE

D ear Marilyn Manson,Please don’t gut me and hang me by my intes-tines for saying I didn’t like your new album.
It’s not that you’ve mellowed with age: “We’re From 

America” drips with contempt, seething with lines like 
“We don’t believe in credibility/ Because we know that 
we’re fucking incredible.” Grinding guitars drench you 
in industrial sludge, and there’s that ice-cold sneer (you 
must’ve spent hours practicing in front of the mirror). 

But then you start repeating yourself on five-minute 
tracks only half-filled with content. “Arma-goddamn-
motherfuckin-geddon,” is a dangerously slow jam, with 
blank-faced delivery feebly stabbing at twisted, aborted 
pop. But while the track isn’t a head-banger, it’ll pass 
for your minions — unlike the video. That cacophony 

of self-indulgent clips of you as a hooded outcast molds 
over faster than a body six feet under. 

“We’re from America” lacks Mechanical Animals’
serial-killer edge, just regurgitated sludge of those firey, 
hot-button controversies you once devoured with such 
irreverence and uncompromising satire.

 Manson you don’t have to scream “FUCK!” to get 
my attention. All I need is some slow, solid head bang-
ing. It’s really too bad the tickets aren’t worth it anymore 
— or the gas it would take to road-trip north.

Marilyn Manson will perform live at the Glen Helen 
Pavillion in San Bernadino on July 12.

Esmee Denters
■ Outta Here
TENMAN, UNIVERSAL NL

N ot since Lonelygirl15 has YouTube birthed a star as eye-catching as Esmee Denters. (Let’s face it: Marie Digby’s Rihanna spiel stopped at one-hit wonder.) 
Aside from the Dutch darling’s toothy, Hannah 

Montana-watt smile, she has the vocal chops to save 
her from little-girl syndrome. It makes sense, then, 
that white knight Justin Timberlake would come to her 
rescue: How gracious, how kind of him to pluck out 
a no-name protege and make her princess of his new 
record label — just like daddy Prince and his long list of 
suckling babes (ahem, Bria Valente). Props to Denters, 
who’s hopped on the pumpkin chariot headfirst — Outta 
Here takes tracks from JT, One Republic frontman Ryan 
Tedder and hitmaker Palow da Don. 

Too bad her vocals take a backseat to primping and 
posing; in her debut, the almost-21-year-old takes care 
to flaunt every curve. The title track and first single is 
the most blatant case in point: Denters rocks the best big 
hair and makeup money can buy. Even without watch-
ing the video clip, we can tell. Perfume oozes from the 

curl-flipping echo “Get me outta here/ Here/ Here.” It’s 
standard procedure, as is JT’s pumped-up guest appear-
ance on a couple flat tracks. 

“Love Dealer” takes uninspiration to the max, eking 
out an overproduced Hilary Duff B-side. And for every 
silky smooth, funkadelic track (“Admit It”), there’s a bal-
lady stepchild lurking in the corner: On “Getting Over 
You,” she wails about failing to do so over the same five-
note sequence.

It’s hard to blame the copycat; she’s unashamed-
ly clutching JT as her guide. But even the prophetic 
Mouseketeer’s ultra-polished production can’t save 
bleached-out harmonies and sinking hooks. While 
skintight autotuning might trounce other wannabes, 
Denters’ Mariah-style vocals need to break free — only 
then will we hear what YouTube’s number-one star is 
really capable of.

“AWAY WE GO”

P ublic Enemies” is set in America’s bullet-holed mobster era, when legends like Al Capone dominated the headlines and an endless stream of devilish gangsters with slick nicknames seized the public’s 
imagination. Against the Great Depression’s slump, “Enemies” paints 
iconic bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in an epic battle of wits 
against federal agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale).

With Depp’s acting chops and Bale’s blockbuster-dazzled past — on 
top of a premise that’s so authentically American it’s almost unpatri-
otic to criticize — “Enemies” is a surefire crowd-pleaser. Although, 
audiences have likely been oversaturated with mobster flicks by now, 
it seems doubtful that gratuitous violence, car chases, sex and period 
costumes will ever grow old.

Staff Writer

“PUBLIC ENEMIES”

Yet another Disney spy flick, “G-Force” softens gun-toting intensity with a bin full of guinea pig fuzz. Commmanding pig Agent Darwin (Sam Rockwell) 
leads a gang of archetypal rodents that includes sexy Latina 
Juarez (Penelope Cruz) and fast-talkin’ thug Agent Blaster 
(Tracy Morgan). Their mission: save the world from one 
billionaire villain’s schemes to rull the planet. 

Of course, there are also robots and fist-sized explosions, 
and probably a joke about pet supplies somewhere in the mix. 
But why watch “G-Force” (in Pixar’s new 3-D technology, no 
less) when you can rent “Spy Kids” and kick back on your 
couch? Save the money and buy a $3 hamster instead.

Staff Writer

“G-FORCE”

O n the arthouse wire, Coppola’s come-back hasn’t exactly been peachy. After his decade-long hiatus, “Youth Without 
Youth” surfaced belly-up; for anyone hop-
ing “Tetro” will be better, Cannes’ consensus 
remains as divided as the Korean peninsula.  

Since flipping off studios and ditching 
Hollywood in the mid ’90s, Coppola has been 
gearing up to personally finance his films — 
growing grapes in Northern California, plant-
ing resort villas in Costa Rica and backing both 
literary-arts magazine “Zoetrope All-Story” and 
production company American Zoetrope. But 
for all his success with capital ventures, the 
Godfather has failed to strike gold with any 
recent blockbusters.

Set in a black-and-white Buenos Aires, 
“Tetro” rings like an amateur screenwright’s first 
shot: a brotherly drama about the dark secrets 
of an immigrant Italian family. Whether or not 
the film can revive Coppola’s crowning glory, 
one thing’s certain — he doesn’t have far to fall.

P erhaps the only shortfall of “Away We Go”— it’s a tad too Whole Foods-wholesome for its own good. A road trip romantic comedy starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph, the film guarantees 
your healthy dose of summer sap in one convenient serving — co-author 
Dave Eggers weilding the heartfelt prose he mastered in 2002’s lightly fic-
tionalized memoir “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.”

For once, it seems “American Beauty” director Sam Mendes has finally 
found a family he can sympathize with. “Go” focuses on a pair of naive 
30-somethings in search of the perfect place to raise their child and, in 
turn, grow up a little themselves. With a solid supporting cast, the comedy 
will likely be what “Juno” couldn’t: a realistic take on unplanned parent-
hood, sans Michael Cera’s awkward overkill.

MOVIE PREVIEWS CONTINUED

I t’s happened: Judd Apatow’s gone deep. He’s no longer writing about awkward 40-year-old virgins, unprotected sex or teenage coitus 
— instead, “Funny People” observes the not-so-
funny lives of everyday goofballs Seth Rogan and 
Adam Sandler.

Sandler plays a seasoned comedian with less than 
a year to live. After being diagnosed with a terminal 
disease, the frowny-faced funnyman copes with his 
looming fate by cracking a slew of death jokes. 

Undoubtedly, some audiences will have trouble 
embracing the film’s darker turns. Apatow told the 
press, “I’m trying to make a very serious movie that 
is twice as funny as my other movies.” We just hope 
the film has enough of the Emmy-winning pro-
ducer’s witty vulgarity to make Sandler as hilarious 
as he deserves to be.

“FUNNY PEOPLE”

I f you’ve ever woken up in a trashed room, lightly speckled with vomit, aching from last night’s debauchery, you’ll probably find the sopho-moric misadventures in “The Hangover” pure comedic genius.
Long ago, some dudes couldn’t find their car — now, they can’t find 

their dude. They’re in Las Vegas for best-pal Doug’s bachelorhood week-
end; only problem is, the bachelor’s gone. The toilet-humor flick is an end-
less train of hijinks, including but not limited to finding a baby in a closet, 
a tiger in a bathroom and a tiny Asian man in the trunk.

With a score of R-rated antics, “The Hangover” has the makings of a frat 
classic. If all else fails, there’s a completely random cameo by Mike Tyson 
that’s sure to snag next year’s Best WTF Moment at the MTV Movie Awards.

“THE HANGOVER”
E ver since “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” went from box-office flop to DVD favorite, Nia Vardalos has 
been sucking the Greek teat dry. But for 
those of you who couldn’t get enough of the 
dizzying family antics and sexual tension 
that started it all, don’t be fooled: “My Life 
in Ruins” is not a sequel. Despite the car-
bon-copy storyline — socially inept Greek 
woman seeks self-fulfillment, finds last-
chance romance with unlikely, ungainly 
suitor and lives happily ever after — Donald 
Petrie’s latest has ditched the innocent indie 
vibe that made the first flick so loveable. 

This time around, Vardalos stars as 
Georgia, an Athens tour guide who suffers 
a midlife crisis while leading an eccentric 
sightseeing group, eventually falling in love 
with her hot bus driver.  

Stuffed with unscrupulous boob jokes 
for your inner third-grader, the date film 
might be good for a few cheap cracks 
(dealt by ignorant tourists and middle-aged 
bitches), but it won’t outweigh its “Big Fat” 
predecessor in genuine humanity.

“MY LIFE IN RUINS”

Q uentin Tarantino is returning to the big screen with his self-proclaimed “ultimate masterpiece”: an epic tribute to spaghet-
ti Westerns, set against the chilling backdrop of 
World War II. Drenched in blood and dripping 
with Tarantino’s signature irreverence, “Inglourious 
Basterds” (it’s spelled that way on purpose) trails a 
group of Jewish soldiers who that sets out to exact 
revenge on the Nazis in occupied France. 

Brad Pitt assumes a starring role as Lt. Aldo 
Raine, a merciless antihero who engages his 
troops in swift retribution. Given the direc-
tor’s previous efforts, the flick could realistically 
set new precedents for buckets of fake blood. 
Tarantino reportedly spent more than a decade 
writing the script, hoping to achieve the same 
delightful balance of gore and humor bubbling 
from “Pulp Fiction.” But whether or not the 
prolific mastermind manages to tap his mojo, 
his penchant for artsy flair and instant, macabre 
gratification is enough to make “Inglourious 
Basterds” worthy of a summer matinee.

“INGLOURIOUS
BASTERDS”

“THE TAKING OF 
PELHAM 1 2 3”

O ne part “Speed” and two parts “Phone Booth,” “The Taking of Pelham 123” will likely amount to 
106 New York minutes of heart-thumping 
melodrama. Revamping the 1974 British 
adaptation of John Godey’s best-selling 
novel, Tony Scott hopes to retain the 
original’s slick cynicism while playing off 
modern-day terrorist fears.

John Travolta, complete with bad-ass 
handlebar mustache, plays a criminal genius 
who hijacks the city subway for a sizable 
ransom. The car’s dispatcher is none other 
than Denzel Washington (plucked by Scott 
for the second time since “Man on Fire”), 
who shines even in previews as hardworking 
blue-collar everyman Walter Garber. 

Tension rattling the rails, Garber must 
find a way to save his terrified hostages 
from gunfire — sure to make audiences 
thankful for San Diego’s shitty public trans-
portation.

tion date for the project.
“We’re working with folks in the 

Development Office and trying to 
develop relationships with donors,” 
Calfas said. “They identify people 
who might have an interest in estab-
lishing a relationship with the uni-
versity and with health and wellness 
issues. [We] meet with them and 
talk about the possibities of what we 
might be able to develop and how 
they can participate in that.”

According to Calfas, services 
provided  the center could be fund-
ed by either a student-fee referen-
dum, current budgetary allocations, 
the implementation of a fee-for-ser-
vice system or as part of the student 
health-insurance plan.

Currently, student registration 
fees provide approximately $5.7 mil-
lion for services and programs in 
the wellness cluster.

Rue said that while the university 
waits to secure funding from indi-
vidual private donors, the Student 
Affairs Office must now focus on 
planning for the center’s future.

“I would love to be optimistic 
and say we can get this going quick-
ly, but people are already overbur-
dened,” Calfas said. “In one sense, 
this is when students need it the 
most, but on the other hand, I don’t 
want this to be a new burden for stu-
dents as well. I know these bad eco-

nomic times do go away. We’re not 
going to just stop our planning. We 
want to be ready to move forward 
when things improve and donations 
are a little more avilalable.”

Calfas said the Student Wellness 
Center, in addition to providing 
room for old services to expand, 
will offer space for the development 
of new services based on student 
interest.

“We want to actually create new 
services for students and provide 
them in a more integrated way,” 
Calfas said. “Once we have funding 
in place, I’m really confident that 
UCSD will be a leader in this area 
of student wellness and that we will 
have programs that are novel and 
cutting-edge.”

Once complete, the four-story 
facility is expected to encompass 
50,000 to 60,000 square feet of space 
north of Main Gymnasium near the 
Student Center. 

 “What we think is unique about 
the center is that the integration of 
services provides a more holistic, 
whole-person approach to health 
and well-being,” Student Wellness 
Director Jerry Phelphs said. 

Phelps said he wants the Wellness 
Center to be a place where experts 
in all areas of health can find the 
appropriate resources to collaborate 
and refer students to the best set of 
available services.

Student Affairs is seeking feed-
back from students to determine 
which services most interest them. 
This has included the development 
of focus groups and consultations 
with student advisory boards. They 
have also monitored a group of 
students for two consecutive years 
to measure their knowledge and 
attitudes about health and to track 
their use of campus wellness pro-
grams. 

“We’re measuring different pro-
grams and health behaviors in gen-
eral to figure out where to best 
direct our activity,” Phelps said. 
“We’re trying to be cost effective.” 

According to Phelps, the sur-
veyed students said they most value 
meditation classes, online tools 
designed to help students manage 
stress and recreation voucher pro-
grams.

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Ed Spriggs said that  
when the Wellness Center is con-
structed and operating, it will still 
be overseen by Calfas and operated 
as part of the wellness cluster. 

“We have not yet determined 
what the Wellness Center’s actual 
operating budget will be,” he said.

cess everybody on the team plays a role 
in molding what the program will look

competition could be a tall task.
“When students say they want 

a football team, they’re thinking 
Division-I USC vs. UCLA,” Grosse said. 
“That just doesn’t seem real feasible.”

While Grosse sees the leap to 
Division-I as more realistic, the move 
comes with a price. The Athletics Fee 
Referendum of 2007 increased athlet-
ics fees from $95 to $329 per year. The 
larger budget was used to comply with 
a then-new Division-II mandate that 
requires all programs to offer $250,000 
in scholarships.

NCAA’s mandate for Division-I 

athletic scholarships is $964,700, 
which may require more money from 
students and donations from UCSD’s 
surrounding community.

Despite the freeze on applications, 
Gupta said the council should start 
planning now for a possible move. 

“We need to start our discussions 
now and take a proactive role in all 
of issues to see what it’s going to cost 
students,” Gupta said. “We need to 
ensure that we’re protecting student 
interest.”

Councilmembers 

voted against 

discontinuing

assumption that 

a two-thirds majo

sary to approve the
 legislation. A.S. 

President Donna B

contested that only
 a simple major-

ity should have bee

Fifteen councilme
mbers voted 

in favor of the legi
slation, while 11 

voted against it. A
 simple-majority 

voting system wou
ld have resulted 

in the  Grove’s clos
ure.

The board reached
 its decision 

after reviewing R
obert’s Rules of 

Order Newly Revis
ed, the council’s 

primary documen
t of parliamen-

tary conduct. Acco
rding to Judicial 

Board Chair Step

vote should have
 depended only 

on a simple majo

has five days from
 its decision on 

Tuesday to release 
its official state-

Although San D
iego County 

health officials anno
unced that more 

confirmed cases of
 swine flu should 

be expected withi
n days, UCSD’s 

Student Health Ser
vices has not yet 

reported any incide
nces.

“We have been te
sting students 

who have flu sym
ptoms as well as 

fever, and all have
 tested negative,” 

SHS Medical Direc
tor Gina Fleming 

said.
On Wednesday, SH

S stopped test-

ing students with m
ild flu symptoms 

in favor of testing o
nly the seriously 

ill. Current precaut
ions include put-

ting students exhibi
ting flu symptoms 

in a separate area in
 the waiting room 

and providing them
 with masks to 

prevent the spread o
f germs. 

“The San Diego C
ounty Health 

Department has m
ade the recom-

mendation that we
 only test people 

who have symptoms
 so severe that we 

are considering ho
spitalizing them,” 

Fleming said early W
ednesday morn-

ing.
SHS’s Urgent Care 

clinic saw an 

average number of
 student visitors 

Monday, but an un
usually high per-

centage reported ha
ving sore throats 

and colds, Fleming 
said.

With five confirmed a
nd 

three suspected cases 
in San Diego County, 
California declares a 
state of emergency.

Don’t hold yo

After two years of p
icking through deta

ils, the commit-

tee tasked with upd
ating UCSD’s 28-ye

ar-old policy on 

“speech, advocacy an
d distribution of liter

ature” has once 

again postponed its 
deadline for complet

ion. 

The committee first 
pushed the release o

f its draft from May 
1 

to seventh week, du
e to lingering disagr

eements about phras
ing. 

Then, earlier this w
eek, vice chancellors

 Steven W. Relyea a
nd 

Penny Rue instructe
d committee chair an

d Associate Controll
er 

Sally Brainerd to ho
ld onto the policy u

ntil fall 2009, when 
a 

public input period w
ill finally commence

. 

Brainerd said the tim
eline would have da

ngerously resem-

bled that of a similar
 scenario in spring 20

07. The speech-polic
y 

committee at the tim
e, chaired by Sports F

acilities Manager Do
n 

Chadwick, released a
 controversial policy 

proposal during fina
ls 

week. The changes 
were sent campusw

ide in an e-mail tit
led 

“Review of PPM 510
-1 Section IX.”

It was met with imm
ediate uproar from s

tudents and faculty 

who felt the admin
istration was trying

 to sneak the restric
tions 

past public review. T
he American Civil L

iberties Union argue
d in a 

letter to the universi
ty that a whopping 1

0 aspects of the polic
y were 

unconstitutional, inc
luding a clause statin

g that any event or ga
thering 

that could “reasonab
ly be expected to att

ract a crowd of 10 o
r more 

people” would requi
re a reservation.

Benjamin Balthaser,
 Graduate Student A

ssociation representa
tive 

on the current com
mittee, was among 

those who participa
ted in an 

emergency rally out
side former Vice C

hancellor of Studen
t Affairs 

Joseph W. Watson’s o
ffice. Second-year Jo

hn Vasquez dedicate
d www.

ucsdfreespeech.com to
 keeping students inf

ormed about the pol
icy.

According to Baltha
ser and committee m

ember and Director
 of 

Student Policies and
 Judicial Affairs Ton

y Valladolid, there h
as been 

speculation that the
 controversial restri

ctions drafted by th
e first 

committee were part
ly in response to cam

pus disruptions at th
e time, 

including antiabortio
n demonstrations an

d protests over chan
ges in 

Thurgood Marshall C
ollege’s Dimensions o

f Culture curriculum
.

Brainerd said the fo
rmer speech-policy 

committee was give
n 

According to the c
urrent draft

of the new speech
 policy, 

the following zone
s would only 

permit electronical
ly ampliﬁ ed 

speech between c
ertain times. 

Otherwise, electron
ic devices 

could be used in a
ny area, as 

long as the the spe
aker is 150 

feet from an occup
ied building. 

No on-campus exp
ression would 

be permitted to ex
ceed 90 

decibels.

Hundreds of students from across the University of California traveled to San Francisco last week to rally for the repeal of 

Proposition 8, a measure that prohibits same-sex marriage in California. Organized in part by UC Santa Barbara senior Urvashi 

Nagrani, the rally drew more than 1,500 demonstrators to Civic Center Plaza to watch a four-hour California Supreme Court 

debate over the constitutionality of the measure, screened on a giant television above the crowd.

CLASS OF 2009
THE GUARDIAN STAFF

GRADUATING EDITORS FINALLY LEAVE PRODUCTION, BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME WISE WORDS AND A HEALTHY DOSE OF NOSTALGIA

Here I am, settling into my writ-
ing nook beside a sticker-cluttered 
file cabinet in the Guardian office for 
the very last time. It’s hard to fight 
nostalgia.

I want to offer you the perfect 
answer, the perfect goodbye. All the 
hundreds of articles, the hours and 

hours of research and interviews and 
A.S. Council meetings, the some-
times tearful fights over word choice 
and design edits, and the late nights 
that turned to mornings — I want 
them to add up to something, some 
insight, more meaningful than their 
parts. But I find my pockets empty. 

I lived the dream. How strange to 
come to the end of something so big 
and hard and wonderful. 

Note that at this point in edits, 
Simone’s rolled eyes are wider than a 
flaxen-haired guide puppy’s as clutch-
es the paper to her chest, red pen in 

hand, and in her most syrup-enchant-
ed voice announces, “Wonderful, guys 
we’re wonderful!” to the production 
room. But that’s the kind of tireless 
criticism (paired with unrivaled syn-
tactical finesse and design skill) the 
Guardian needs. 

And so, as is tradition, to the shout 
outs. 

Most of my time at UCSD has been 
spent stretching to meet the perfection 
I saw in the Guardian’s Golden Age. 
This sendoff seems empty without at 
least a nod to Grant’s sophisticated 
attention to detail, Ian’s indescribable 
knack for everything cool and impor-
tant, Vlad’s fervor for improvement, 
Cody’s shut-up-and-dance style and 
Marianne’s biting wit. I also owe big 
thanks to Charles, who stretched right 

along with me and brought a bumpin’ 
playlist; Nathan, who is a tremendous-
ly thoughtful editor and person; and 
Mike, who keeps this place running 
year after year. 

To Simone: I can’t express how 
proud and excited I am for you; you’re 
going to be the best editor this paper’s 
seen in quite a while. I might have a 
celebrity crush. Just keep your eye on 
the clock next year — it doesn’t mat-
ter how bomb the paper is if no one 
gets to read it. 

To next year’s editors: I know I 
don’t say it enough — or ever — 
but you guys have helped raise the 
Guardian to a new standard of qual-
ity and, if you work for it, things will 

I write long. That’s why it’s 
weird that after spending so many 
years as a sports writer for the 
Guardian and discussing topics 
from Kazaam to Space Jam and 
everything in between (though 
mostly just Kazaam and Space Jam) 
I’m finding it hard to write about 
myself and my time here. Instead, 
I’ll just write a long drawn-out 
thank you that will satisfy my own 
guilt-ridden need to let people 
know that I appreciate them. So 
thank you to everyone who ever 
took the time to read one of my 
columns, no matter how long, 
irrelevant or boring. Thank you to 
everyone who responded with what 
they liked, didn’t like or how useful 
the Guardian was during bowel 
movements. Thank you to every-
one in the office who kept giving 
me space to ramble needlessly and 
was good about cutting out the 
crap, even if some of the crap I 
found hilarious. Thank you to all 
the editors, sports editors, assis-
tant sports editors, etc. who have 
given me so much flexibility to just 
write, despite how crappy I think 
each and everyone of my columns 
is. Thank you to all of the UCSD 
athletes, coaches and anyone that 
ever took the time to answer a 
few questions while I stood with 
a tape recorder acting like I knew 
what I was doing. Thank you to 
anyone who ever sat there with me 
while I was coming up with ideas 
or writing down things that may 
or may not be funny or interest-
ing, gave me a funny suggestion 
or unfunny suggestion that I still 
used anyway. Thank you to the cit-
ies of Philadelphia, Bakersfield and 
Tucson for being so shitty and ripe 
for insult. Thanks to anyone who 
came to a basketball game or any 
sporting event to watch with me 
and keep my company and allow 
me to act like a big deal in front 
of other people when flashing a 
press pass. Most of what I write in 
columns was purely to entertain 
myself, so if anyone else ever was 
an entertained bystander, thank 
you for reading in the right place 
at the right time. Writing about 
the UCSD men’s basketball team or 
any other UCSD sport has always 
been about trying to get out just 

LONGEST-STANDING
SPORTS COLUMNIST
EVER 2005-09

To be cliche, I’m going to start off 
with a word everyone’s probably tired 
of hearing by now: change. Across 
the globe, the future is a big, fat ques-
tion mark — economically, socially, 
personally and I’m sure for some of 
you even academically — that mani-
fests itself very differently for every-
one. For better or for worse, however, 
it is our obligation as young citizens 
to make absolutely sure that we do 
everything in our power to facilitate 
these changes in a positive way when 
at all possible. And that, ladies and 
gentlemen, begins with education.

First off, every single one of you 
should feel lucky to be here: a world-
class university with an outstanding 
scholarly reputation, sunny beach-
side home, thriving social life (gasp, 
did I just defend UCSD?) and, admit-
tedly, enough organic chemistry to 
make even Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox cringe. But that’s what makes 
our campus so special; we’re smart, 
we’re laid back and we know when 

to be serious (adding that last crucial 
graph to our final biology lab report) 
and when to have a raging good time 
(flailing uncontrollably under the 
dance tent during Sun God).

Granted, most of you worked 
very hard to get where you are, and 
I respect that. But soon you’ll be 
where I am right at this very moment 
— about to leave, and ready for a 
steady nine-to-five, top-notch gradu-
ate program or bumming around for 
a year before deciding to make the 
next step. Regardless of your plans, 
though, you must not forget that 
— no matter where you came from 
— you are one of the privileged few 
to make it through an expensive, 
convoluted system and that facili-
tating similar opportunities for the 
next generation using the skills you 
acquired as a Triton will become 
your responsibility.

And it will be a huge respon-
sibility. Student fees have jumped 
nearly $2,000 since I was a freshman, 
enrollment is being slashed substan-
tially, student services are diminish-
ing, everyone from the UC Board of 
Regents to the A.S. Council wants 
more money and state leaders have

���:,5069�:,5+6--:� ;/,�<*:+�.<(9+0(5� ;/<9:+(@��1<5,������� 

There are a lot of words out there 
that haunt me. Usually they are placed 
together so well by people so much 
better at writing than myself that I can’t 
help but cringe. Sometimes they haunt 
me even while I sleep on them, even 
under a bottle of whiskey. 

The Guardian is well stocked with 
the next generation of intimidating 
writers. Nevertheless, some of us are 
going to circle our draining industry 
— probably hung-over. 

As the typical drunk, misanthropic 
writer I aspire to be, I’m eager to circle 
that drain right into the shadow of 
greatness: Hemmingway, Faulkner — 
Tori Spelling. 

But it was the great Hunter S. 
Thompson that inspired me to the 
Guardian’s door. He was a hell’s angel 
for a year, shot to the top ranks of 
Nixon’s enemies list and once dropped 
the still bloody heart of a four-point 
buck on Jack Nicolson’s doorstep to 
spice up a lonely night. It never got 
weird enough for him and I hope it 
never does for me.

It hasn’t gotten weird enough for 
Matt Taibi either, who got himself 
arrested in Russia to uncover corrup-
tion, interviewed John Kerry while 
wearing a gorilla suit — on shrooms — 
and spent time as a young Republican 
to find out what makes the weirdest 
contradiction in politics tick. If only I 
can haunt as well as he does someday.

Literary inspiration aside, it was 
Hadley Mendoza who bantered me 
into actually applying to the paper and 
why I always smiled with genuine love 
through the fog of hate on production 
nights. Matt McArdle welcomed me to 
one of my first news meeting — and 
the quote wall — with a comedy room 
come-on, and he’s been lobbing them 

I submitted one of my first news 
articles to my editor more than 
three years ago, and was silently 
and shamefully humiliated when my 
brutally edited article was published 
in the paper. I honestly thought it 
was clever, but instead, I imagined 
that the six hours I spent writing the 
story only led to behind-my-back 
snickering.

And it was my fault. Not for 
being stupid, but for being big-
headed enough to think I couldn’t 
have an ounce of stupidity in me. I 
didn’t read the Guardian, or news 
in general, as much as I should have 
— I couldn’t even make it to cam-
pus for class — and therefore wasn’t 
completely familiar with the writing 
style. I rarely went to meetings, bare-
ly knew any of the staff members 
and the Cityshuttle article was the 
third one I’d written in a six-month 
period. 

Yes, it was a shitty article because 
I was shitty journalist. And in a bold 
move, I applied for the associate 
news editor position after it was 
published.  

Landing the job forced me to do 

things I wouldn’t have done other-
wise. Like writing more than three 
articles every six months, attending 
meetings twice a week and partici-
pating in Guardian events like Vegas 
and karaoke — all of which resulted 
in my journalism professor, and for-
mer Los Angeles Times writer, telling 
me last month that I had “mastered” 
the basic news writing style. 

So thank you Alyssa for prying 
me off the bed at 9 a.m. Vegas time, 
semi-drunk and slightly functional, 
to do a phone interview for an article 
due the next day, because improve-
ment starts with forcing yourself to 
do things you don’t want to do. 

And that’s one of the most valu-
able things I’ve learned from work-
ing at the Guardian. I never craved 
writing all those Cityshuttle and 
parking articles. But it taught me 
how to be an investigative reporter, 
and it made me a more seasoned 
writer. 

From frat hazing to state budgets, 
the Guardian has taught me all the 
perks of being a journalist — aside 
from hate mail through Facebook 
from Pi Kappa Alpha brother Alan 
Roof — and how those perks will 
help me after graduation. 

Journalists get information faster 
than most people. It’s our job to 
find the answer to any question. 
Journalists are also quick studies, 
constantly learning new subjects 
— such as policies and what an 
elephant walk is — then turning 
around and teaching those things 
to the public. And since we follow 

stories, not nine-to-five schedules, 
journalists have a great work ethic. 
We drop everything for breaking 
news. 

These traits are rooted in all the 
Guardian staffers. My time at the 
paper would have been completely 
unfulfilling had you all been fat, 
fobby, born-again Christians who 
refused alcohol or Bob.

To Matt: I have a confession. 
When I first saw you I thought, 
“Damn, that white boy’s kinda hot.” 
And that’s saying a lot for a former 
darkie-lover. 

To Reza: I’ll never forget your 
thizz face, tulip joint or knife throw-
ing. Damn Persian politician. 

To Jesse: the best gladiator-san-
dal and tie-dyed-shirt clad, Spanish-
speaking hippie I know.

To Alyssa: Vegas baby. You and 
me. 

To Yelena: Good luck next year as 
news editor, and on incorporating a 
pun into a news lead.

To Hadley: I don’t know what 
everyone else is talking about 
because you’ve never been a bitch 
to me.

To Simone: Thanks for always 
improving my articles. I know you’ll 
be an amazing editor in chief.

To Dave: Don’t forget to visit 
Pattaya Beach when you’re in 
Thailand. Remember, sawatikaa 
means “hello,” kop kun kaa means 
“thank you” and beware of the hot 
trannies. 

To the rest of the Guardian staff: 
live it, love it, work it.

how awesome these sports are to as 
many people as possible. Even if just 
one person who did or didn’t attend 
the game read a recap and thought 
about going to the next game, that’s 
enough for me. My time as a student 
at UCSD and with the Guardian has 
allowed me to meet everyone from 
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton 
to Kobe Bryant and Adam Morrison 
(truly the Barack Obama and Hillary 
Clinton of the NBA). I’m not sure 
what comes next, but whatever it is I 
will face it with the same wild-eyed 
confusion and Southern California-
induced composure that has gotten 
me this far. And sorry to everyone 
who’s thank you got cut, cause I’m 
sure this went long too.

Last Winter Quarter I timidly 
stumbled into the Guardian offices 
in the Student Center to attend an 
informational meeting promising free 
pizza. I didn’t know what to expect 
— especially since I was the only 
interested student to show up. As I 
stared at the roundtable of editors and 
senior staffers, I nearly lost my nerve. 
I went back for an interview later at 
my roommate Sarah’s urging. It will 
be worth it, she said, especially if I was 
serious about writing.

I’ve had the pleasure of writing for 
the Focus section, as well as serving as 
the section’s associate editor.  During 
my time at Focus, I’ve met and inter-
viewed some amazing people. From 
a Chilean activist forced to flee her 
homeland after nearly being executed 
for her ideals to a group of pre-med 
students ditching the beach over sum-

mer break to bring much-needed 
medical supplies to small Nicaraguan 
villages, the Guardian has been a won-
derful platform from which to tell 
stories that mattered.

There is also no better place to 
be if you want to learn the random, 
interesting, and controversial minutia 
about campus and the research that 
goes on here — like the significance 
of bioluminescent worms, how the 
UCSD film department actually works 
and the true identity of the guy who 
rides his bike blasting Alicia Keys 
while blowing bubbles around cam-
pus. As a reporter, I became vested in 
this campus and will not leave as clue-
less as I entered.

The Guardian also taught me a 
thing or two about being a true San 
Diegan. Even though I’m a San Diego 
native, Site Seen assignments revealed 
to me a side of San Diego I would 
have never seen otherwise. Are you so 
angry that you need to pay to smash 

shit (Sarah’s Smash Shack)? I’ve done 
it. Want to see the ultimate in drag 
dining (Lips)? I’ve seen it. In the mood 
for drunken Korean karaoke (Min Sok 
Chon)? I’ve done it.

It’s been whirlwind experience 
filled with late nights and frequent 
Burger King soft-serve runs that 
Stephanie and Dave (my fellow page 
editors) and I didn’t think we’d sur-

vive. Now that we have, I want to wish 
Edwin and Aprille the best of luck 
with Focus next year.

Matt, Alyssa and Serena, thanks 
for welcoming an awkward, shy writer 
like me. Dave, Stephanie, and Emily 
— the Focus gang — I’ll miss our in-
depth conversations on sTORI Telling 
by Tori Spelling. 

So, was it all worth it? Hell yes.

It was a dark and stormy night. The 
lights in the Guardian offices flickered 
on with a merciful power surge as edi-
tors clacked blindly on their keys, count-
ing the hours past deadline, crossing 
and re-crossing red lines on bloody first 
pages. Lady Gaga and Milkman took to 
the speakers, technofuzz dampening on 
contact as a high-hat tapped at the brass 
one-two-three-four, a delicious quarter-
beat. And in the midst of the fog, the 
copy editor read and reread the last line, 
wondering what the fuck did that mean 

and then censored all unnecessary com-
mas, shooting down dashes with pitiless 
punches at Delete.

Just kidding. Ridiculousness aside, 
I loved my job(s) at the Guardian. No 
matter how many dark and stormy 
nights, being copy editor was great. 
Being associate hiatus editor was awe-
some. Who wouldn’t love poring over 
AP Stylebook 2007 — props to those 
intensely subtle, brilliant writers — or 
rewriting reviews on indiefucking bands 
I’d never heard of before? It was a learn-
ing experience to the Nth degree, and I 
embraced it with open arms.

So the dirty lies in that sentence

IT’S OUR WAY OF SAYING WE’RE PROUD OF YOU.

It’s June again, and that means yet 
another year has come and gone for 
me at UCSD. Another year of con-
struction and classes, endless library 
hours, crammed schedules, loom-
ing deadlines and three quarter-long 
sprints for “who can set the curve.” 
In years past, as the weather warmed 
and the school year wound down to a 
close, my mind would wander ahead 
to the glorious days of summer. I 
would dream of a time when I’d be 
free from the confines of a rigorous 
schedule and the stress caused by liv-
ing in a community of concrete and 
bureaucracy. Every year until now, 
I’ve looked forward to months six 
through nine as a time to recharge my 
batteries, reconnect with friends and 
to expand personal interests and hob-

bies. However, this year is different. 
This year, I graduate. As the day to 
walk crawls ever closer, I find myself 
in a more pensive mood than usual. 
This year, instead of trying to rush into 
summer sloth, I am reflecting on the 
time I’ve spent here and looking ahead 
with measured caution. 

So much has changed during my 
tenure at UCSD that it’s hard for me to 
even know where to begin. I will spare 
you all the “When I was a freshman, 
Sixth College didn’t even exist” speech. 
I will leave the “as we move forward” 
cliches about taking the next step in 
life to the graduation speakers. Those 
things have all been said before, in 
the pages of this very paper, by people 
who are much better writers than I’ll 
ever be. Instead, I would like to use my 
word count to thank all the people who 
have helped me reach this milestone.

First and foremost, to my family: 
Thank you, a million times over. You 
have supplied me with a bottomless 
well of support and understanding, 
and for that I will be ever grateful. I 
am quite stubborn and have always 
insisted on doing things my way, on 
my terms, in my own time — and 

you’ve always had my back, unques-
tionably, since day one. To my parents 
especially: Your love and patience is 
something that I won’t truly under-
stand until I have a child of my own. 
You have set the standard high and 
I’m doing my best to keep it that way.

To all the engineers I befriended 
during my time here, and especially 
to the S&E crew: Thank you. Without 
you guys to share in the glory that is an 
all-night fluid mechanics homework 
session, or experience the frustration 
of a design project that just never 
works out the way it’s supposed to, I 
would have most likely gone insane. 
I have met some truly intelligent and 
driven people that I am honored to 
call my friends.

A big thank you goes out to all 
bosses, managers and co-workers that 
I have worked with during my time 
here on campus. A special thanks is 
reserved for Bob and Jimmy, who not 
only gave me a chance, but put up with 
my schedule and even recommended 
me for a job at the Guardian.

And finally, to the Guardian itself: 

NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR

Unlike most of the staff, I never 
walked a beat or spent a late night in 
the production room. I never waged 
battle against the Koala in sloshball 
or spent a President’s Day weekend 
in Vegas attempting to eat my way 
through the Bellagio buffet. In fact, 
this is the first and last article that 
I have written for the Guardian. 
There’s a fairly good reason why; 
it takes me ages to write a single 
article, and along the way there are 
long bouts of writer’s block and 
false starts. In fact, this article you’re 

reading is version three or four of 
my many partial rough drafts. My 
inability to pump out articles at a 
moment’s notice also explains why 
I have spent my four years at the 
Guardian as an advertising designer 
instead of a writer. 

Working at the Guardian kept 
me fairly close to the eye of the 
storm and showed me that UCSD 
was not entirely devoid of activity 
as I had been led to believe when 
I first arrived. My hiring came at 
the same time a scandal broke at 
SRTV over porn being aired on a 
student-run television channel. For

are “open arms” and “embraced.” I 
did neither at first; I actually took on 
copy reading because I was a desperate 
freshman in need of a job. And when 
I started writing for Hiatus, my words 
were all wrong. “Good” and “Bad” 
don’t exist on the page, and I was shov-
ing them in left and right. But what did 
I know? All I had to back me up was a 
couple years of high school newspaper; 
a few Quill and Scroll badges. I still had 

the Spice Girls on my iPod. (And now, 
I still do.)

But after two years of fierce battle, 
I clutched my prize: better writing 
and more patience than ever before. It 
sounds cliche, but all those metaphors 
meant something to me. Every time I 
heard music scrape or sigh or orgasm, 
it excited me. Reviewing music means 
you look a little closer than everyone 
else, and you break down why it should 
matter to the world. In copy editing, 

it’s the same: clarity and vivacious-
ness trumps murkiness and placid-
ity. Boring doesn’t click. Write what 
excites you, and guaranteed, you’ll 
excite someone else.

Next year, I’m filling my proverbial 
grab bag with these life lessons, and 
trooping on down to the UCLA School 
and Theatre, Film and Television. 
Maybe a newsroom will show up in 
my first short film. Or maybe, any of 
you will.

over cigarettes ever since. 
Justin Williams convinced me to 

write from Egypt while I was abroad 
— wasn’t that a great idea — and Sonia 
made me never want to leave my office 
unless it was with her. Simone, I can’t 
thank you enough for your snarky 
criticism, I am much better for it. 
Please read that in your mocking voice, 
it’s better than the cutsie one.

Alyssa, thanks for teaching me not 
to mock God-people. Oops. Some 
things never change.

Joanna and Stephanie, I can’t even 
begin. I could go on, but won’t, because 
I hate shout outs.

Now that I’m at the bottom of the 
bottle, I am really looking forward to 

the road and I know I will look back 
at the Guardian and remember that I 
didn’t learn in class, but on the job. I had 
some amazing times, and surprisingly 
enough, I remember most of them. 

I couldn’t have asked for a better 
place to start my repertoire; I’ve pub-
lished ridiculousness in my “Dave in 
Cairo” column, boasted a sick stench 
of Wild Turkey while working and 
driven off with a Koala girl’s car during 
a production night beer run. 

But I’m looking to branch out, and 
there’s really two places I can end up: 
on those pages you can’t stop turning 
or that dumpster over by Muir. Hell, 
maybe I’ll get lucky and have both. 
Either way it’s going to be a fucking 
hazy adventure.

those who missed it, the story hit 
national news, and SRTV was sub-
sequently shut down, in a series of 
rather chaotic events. Other stories 
followed — wildfires, the opening of 
Price Center East, the annual debate 
over the Grove Caffe, and of course 
the annual push to raise student fees 
through one means or another. I leave 
UCSD with the story of a bird dive-
bombing students in Price Center. 

The Guardian is unequivocally 
the best place to work on campus. 
Where else does one get to debate the 
grammatically correct past tense of 
“ghostriding the whip?” Or walking 
in on a Wednesday afternoon to see 
an editor emphatically singing Celine 
Dion while on his knees. I will always 
remember crashing classes on Sun 
God, laughing at the crazy letters to 
the editor that manage to find their 
way to us (one in particular claimed 
Scarlett Johansson was a cloned 
human), and laughing at the market-
ing staff comparing their cute friends 
on Facebook. Oh, and occasionally 
we put out a newspaper issue or two.

A few words of thanks before 

I leave. First, thanks to the busi-
ness staff, the two Mikes (now 
down to one), James the free agent, 
Superman Alfredo and the busi-
ness manager position that turned 
over like a professorship in Defense 
against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts, 
set straight by Anna and currently 
headed by Monica. Thanks also to all 
the other advertising designers who 
have joined me at some point the 
Guardian, including Laura, Jennifer, 
Nick, Kim, Brandon and Jenny, you 
guys are awesome. And finally thanks 
to all four years’ worth of Guardian 
staff, lead by Grant, Heather, Charles 
and Matt, for keeping the Guardian a 
fun place to work.

As I pondered over how to end 
this, I realized that I am severely 
underqualified to leave words of wis-
dom for people to read, but I will just 
say that college isn’t about locking 
yourself in your room and studying 
24/7, nor is it about partying it up 
every night until your liver takes 
you to court for abuse and neglect. 
College is about finding the happy 
medium between the two, and sur-
viving to tell the tale.

▶ CHEN, MYVT�WHNL���

Thank you. Thank you for accept-
ing me in your warm embrace, as if 
this was always my home and I just 
never knew it. Coming into the office 
was always an exciting experience to 
say the least, so thank you to all the 
personalities that made my two years 
on staff the most colorful I’ve experi-
enced on this campus. 

Finally, I’d like to leave all of you 
continuing on at UCSD with a bit of 
advice, one of the most important 
things I learned while here: UCSD is 
as fun as you make it. When I first 
attended this campus as a freshman, 
I absolutely hated it. My classes were 
huge, the campus was outrageously 
large and everybody seemed addicted 
to their cell phones, cramming their 
faces into the dim screens of their next 
digital fix the moment class was dis-
missed. My perception of this campus 
was that of a cold, sterile place where 
thousands of nerds gathered in stag-

nant silence. This was not my idea of 
how college was supposed to be — this 
place sucked. 

Well, the classes are even bigger 
now, the campus is ever stretching, 
and we students no longer wait for the 
end of class to text. So why do I have 
fond memories of this place at all? The 
short answer is that I changed. I found 
that, instead of pointing the finger and 
complaining, doing something about 
it actually made a difference.

If you are tired of this place being 
boring, bring the flavor. If one day a 
year isn’t enough to cut loose, wear 
that crazy Sun God outfit and get 
drunk at the pub before class during 
week three of Fall Quarter. No excus-
es! You aren’t going to be 20-some-
thing and in college forever. We might 
be some of the brightest California has 
to offer, but we are too often locked in 
our own lane, blinders on, during our 
quarterly sprint to a letter grade. Free 
your mind, and your ass will follow!

refused to prioritize higher education 
time and time again. Schwarzenegger 
even wants to eliminate the Cal Grant 
program (can anyone say horrible, 
horrible idea?), in effect telling stu-
dents to simply borrow more (borrow-
ing sure worked great for our econo-
my, awesome advice) to finance their 
educations. Yes, higher education has 
huge obstacles ahead. But obstacles are 
meant to be overcome.

Could you think of your life with-
out college? Sure. Would you want to? 
Hopefully not. So I ask you to please 
consider these final words: Whatever 
you do in the future, don’t forget your 

time at UCSD, and work hard (everyone 
has something to lend) to make sure 
higher education doesn’t become unat-
tainable for others. That way, another 
wide-eyed undergrad will be able to 
live, learn and laugh in your dorm in 10 
years, and the cycle will continue.

OK, I’m done proselytizing. Now 
I must bid farewell to this home away 
from home, the campus newspaper 
offices. It is here that I found my place 
at UCSD, and somehow I made it to 
the top spot, sacrificing my social life 
and tanking more than a few classes 
along the way. But it was worth it. For 
every 4 a.m. night I had — scanning 
PDFs, making last-minute edits and re-

re-writing headlines — seeing just one 
person reading the Guardian the next 
day reminded me why I did this for five 
years. I have met and worked alongside 
incredible people during my time here, 
and it will be strange to think I no lon-
ger need to sacrifice every Wednesday 
and Sunday to the production Gods. 
But, alas, it’s time to go.

To Simone: I don’t have the right 
words to describe how smart, genuine 
and talented you are, but I know you’ll 
do the paper right. To everyone else 
on staff (past, present and future): I 
couldn’t have done it without you. 
Thank you all so much for everything 
— it’s been a pleasure.

only get better next year. My advice 
to you is twofold. First, know that 
complacency is the enemy of progress. 
Second, don’t be too quick to discount 
anyone — Simone was nearly fired for 
designing too slowly and I was rejected 
from every section, including distribu-
tion, before I finally harassed the copy 
editors into giving me a job. You never 
know who’s going to surprise you. 

To General Store Co-op mem-

bers and everyone else at the Student 
Center: There is more humor, passion 
and delicious food in this small, filthy-
floored corner of campus than in the 
whole rest of UCSD. You defined my 
college experience. Thanks for making 
it a good one.

And to the readers who saw this 
thing through to the end: Thank you. 
I guess what I’ve been getting at all 
along is: “If you want to sing out, sing 
out. And if you want to be free, be free.”

that though he was unfamiliar with 
the details of Born’s case, he thought 
Warren College Residential Life offi-
cials’ handling of the case — as 
opposed to the contract language 
— could be the source of the com-
plaints.

“It may very well not be a result 
of a flawed policy,” he said. “The 
policy could have been implement-
ed in a flawed way.”

Valladolid said that if Born’s 
proof of innocence was conclusive, 
some form of restoration for his 
punishment may be suitable.

“If he was found not in viola-
tion of the housing contract, then 
it seems to me that it would be 
appropriate for there to be some 
restorative justice in this sense,” 
Valladolid said. “There should be 
some attempt to ameliorate the con-
sequences.”

Valladolid added that the uni-
versity’s current eviction procedures 
allow for certain checks on adminis-
trative decisions.

“There is review built into that 
process,” he said. “There is review 
up to the provost. Each of them can 
look at the totality of the circum-
stances and weigh in on whether 
or not the decision is a fair one, if 
it followed appropriate due process 
and if there wasn’t something that 
was overlooked. … It is not entirely 
the resident dean and no one else 
that has an opportunity to look at 
this.”

However, Valladolid said that a 
situation such as Born’s — in which 
the case review took place several 
weeks after he had been evicted 
from his campus residence — may 
be unavoidable given the time con-
straints surrounding this process.

“That’s unfortunately just 
because there are specific require-
ments as to timing,” he said. “To set 
up a meeting, to go in, to talk about 
it — in that interim, lots of things 
happen, including a student leaving 
campus upon being evicted.”

Chou’s violations were not removed from her record after her own judicial board 
hearing on April 30, despite the fact 
that her drug test proved she did 
not use any illicit substances on the 
evening that Roake confronted her 
and Born. The board ruled that she 
should be held responsible for the 
actions of her roommate’s guest. 

“My roommate’s coworker 
smoked weed,” Chou said. “I didn’t 
know anything about what was 
going on and I’m being held respon-
sible for it. I don’t think that’s fair. 
… Do I have to set up surveillance 
cameras to make sure nothing out 
of the ordinary is happening while 
I’m not there?”

Chou is now appealing her case 
before Warren College Provost 
Steven Adler. 

Former campuswide senator 
Chris Westling, who serves as the 
A.S. representative to the campus 
housing and dining committee, 
said the clause could be altered if 
the changes were agreed upon by 
the  other committee members and 
Director of Housing and Dining 
Services Mark Cunningham. 

“From my understanding, 
this clause in the contract gives 
the administration a tremendous 
amount of power,” Westling said. 
“We need to scrutinize not only this 
clause, but others that give a dispro-
portional amount of power to one 
entity on campus.”

Severson said the UC General 
Counsel’s office would also have to 
approve any changes to the contract. 

All representatives from the 
Warren College residential life office 
and the Warren College administra-
tion declined to comment for this 
article.

outstanding college. And you did!  And 
now, “4 days” later, you’re graduating. 
Congratulations to a fine young lady, 

we love and are very proud of you. 

Dad & Mom.

I feel like I’ve learned so much since 
I’ve been here.”

Rainwater said that women’s head 
coach Darcy Ahner, a former hep-
tathlete from the University of New 
Mexico, has been very influential 
during her time at UCSD.

“She knows exactly what I’m 
going through,” Rainwater said. 
“She has a lot of insight, not only 
on the physical and technical work, 
but also on the mental aspect of 
keeping your head in the game for 
48 hours.” 

Danielle Thu
While setting personal goals may 

seem critical for some athletes, junior 
hammer thrower Danielle Thu likes 
to keep an open mind and see where 
her throws take her.

“I tend not to set goals for myself, 
because I feel it limits my abilities,” 
Thu said. “I don’t want to say I want 
to throw 190 [feet], then that’s my 
accomplishment for the year so I 
won’t try any harder.” 

The Earl Warren College junior 
had an exceptional season, set-
ting the school record in the 
hammer throw and besting that 
mark twice. Her season culmi-
nated in San Angelo, Texas, with 
the NCAA Division-II National 
Championships. Thu didn’t just win, 
she blew dust at the competition 
on her way to becoming UCSD’s 
first national champion in the event. 
Thu’s mark of 198’8” won the event 
by nearly 14 feet and surpassed her 
own school record by nine feet. It 
was the fifth highest ever recorded 
in Division-II history. 

Thu started throwing shot put 
and discus in elementary school, and 
began hammer throw just before 
high school. Though hammer throw 
is very seldom held in high school 
competitions, she was introduced to 
the event at a UCLA track and field 
camp. Thu excelled at the event and 

was eventually recruited to UCSD’s 
team. 

Her successful season comes 
after years of weight training and 
technique practice, but Thu cites 
her desire to succeed as her great-
est asset. 

“I really compete against myself,” 
Thu said. “I always try to push myself 
to do better, and that’s what I really 
care about.”

are left to live vicariously through the 
team we worship.

People in California are spoiled 
sports fans. The San Francisco 49ers, 
then-Anaheim Angels and Los 
Angeles Lakers have all been crowned 
champions in the past 15 years, giv-
ing us unlimited taunting rights. 

However, in my collegiate years 
(which have been lengthy, as I attempt 
to become the longest tenured politi-
cal science major and Guardian 
sports writer in history), I have been 
unable to watch a 
California profes-
sional sports team 
win it all (sorry 
Los Angelinos, 
the University of 
Southern California 
is not a professional 
team — even if 
some of its players 
get paid).

I have never seen 
a championship cel-
ebration engulf the UCSD campus, 
setting off what I can only assume 
would resemble a hybrid of Welcome 
Week and the Sun God Festival. I 
watched Red Sox fans celebrate the 
end of their drought in 2004 with 
reserved jealousy, but the creases still 
left in their brand new jerseys showed 
that you can’t really have a Boston 
celebration in San Diego.

I yearn for a celebration before 
I leave this campus. Yes, I admit to 
being a spoiled sports fan, and I 
know there are many fans of many 
teams who have waited far, far lon-
ger. Honestly, if I never take part in 
another championship celebration, 
the feeling after the Angels won the 
World Series in 2002 will suffice for 
the rest of my life. Still, when you feel 
such an undying love for sports, it’s 
natural to always want more. It’s why 
we watch. It’s why we care.

The Lakers almost gave us a rea-
son to celebrate last season, and most 
people tricked themselves into think-
ing the Lakers would beat the Boston 
Celtics. We watched. We cared. They 
lost.

This year, the Lakers have been 
a better team than the Orlando 
Magic. They have Kobe Bryant, the 
best player in the series. Their edge 
is experience, particularly because 
much of the same team played in the 
NBA Finals last season. The triangle 
offense provides a much more stable 

structure on both 
sides of the ball — 
if used properly 
— than anything 
the Magic can put 
together. With 
a solid rotation, 
foundation and 
determination, the 
Lakers have all the 
pieces they need 
for a champion-
ship.

Unfortunately, the Magic have a 
few things going for them. They have 
better team chemistry, are far deeper, 
can stretch the floor, swept the Lakers 
in the regular season and, most 
importantly, have been better battle-
tested on their way to the finals. 
Orlando has defeated two of the best 
four teams in the league already, and 
the East has shown this season that it 
can provide playoff battles with the 
likes of LeBron James and Dwayne 
Wade. The up-and-coming Bulls, 
Hawks and Sixers may give rise to 
epic conference playoff battles for 
years to come.

My head tells me the Lakers are 
doomed to repeat failure in the final 
stage. But with the school year com-
ing to a close, my heart tells me 
it’s about time for that just-finished-
your-final kind of feeling.

Joe goes with: Lakers in seven.

MEN’S CREW — It has been a record-
breaking year for the Tritons. UCSD 
trained since the fall with an ulti-
mate goal in mind: qualify for the 
prestigious Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships, the 
national championship equivalent 
for rowing. Now, after a second-place 
finish at the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association Championships, 
that dream becomes a reality as the 
Tritons make their first-ever appear-
ance at the IRAs from June 4 to June 7 
at Lake Natoma in Sacramento. 

“It is a great honor for all of us to be 

a part of something so special,” sopho-
more Justin Gordon said of the IRA 
Championships. “Not only do we get 
to compete against the best collegiate 
crews in America, but we’re now part 

of UCSD crew history.”
In April’s San Diego Crew Classic, 

UCSD was labeled the underdog. 
Although they were seeded lower 
than teams they had  beaten earlier in 

the season, the Tritons  immediately 
squashed preconceptions by taking top 
honors. The varsity eight squad’s first-
place finish earned it a spot in next 
year’s Copley Cup and asserted UCSD 
as one of the premier units in collegiate 
rowing. Their top-25 ranking from the 
U.S. Rowing Collegiate National Polls 
all season long positioned the Tritons 
among rowing’s national elite.

At the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association Championships 
earlier in May, UCSD finished third 
despite only entering five boats. 
Gonzaga University haunts the Tritons, 
inching ahead of UCSD in several 
races. In the Grand Final, the varsity 
eight boat snatched a silver medal for 

their second-place photo finish.
“Going into [that race] we knew 

Gonzaga was going to be fast,” Gordon 
said. “It had been more than a month 
since we had seen them, so we really 
didn’t know what sorts of strides they 
had taken in the interim. We now 
know how fast they are and what we 
have to shoot for — one second over 
the course of six minutes. The IRAs 
are an opportunity for us to take our 
fastest boat and see how it directly 
stacks up against well-established row-
ing powerhouses. Knowing that how 
we train will be directly correlated with 
our national standing is all the motiva-
tion we need to push ourselves harder 
everyday on and off the water.”

Rowing is the oldest intercollegiate 
sport in the United States, and the East 
Coast Ivies have a well rooted rapport 
with the pastime. This year however, 
the West Coast will be hosting the 
107th IRA Championships.

UCSD’s varsity eight squad will 
consist of senior co-captain Ryan 
Andre, junior Karam Badran, senior 
Jeff Collett, sophomore Kris Grey, 
junior Andrew Hilton, junior Jay Dee 
Morgan, sophomore Michael Verdone 
(moving up from the second varsity 
eight boat), junior coxswain Cameran 
Biltucci and Gordon.

Finishing its most successful sea-son in school history, the wom-en’s track and field team placed 
third at nationals May 23. Junior ham-
mer thrower Danielle Thu and junior 
heptathlete Linda Rainwater high-
lighted the meet, winning two of the 
Tritons’ three gold medals.

Linda Rainwater 
Since making the move to Division 

II in 2000, the track and field team has 
won five individual national champi-
onships — with Rainwater earning two 
in as many seasons.

One of the team’s strongest athletes, 
Rainwater won the heptathlon in 2008 
and the high jump in 2009. After plac-

ing third in this year’s heptathlon, she 
took home the high jump title with a 
school record mark of 5’9.75”. But the 
event was not without drama. 

Competitors are given three chanc-
es to clear each bar height, and their 
number of attempts determines tie-
breaks. Rainwater missed her first two 
attempts at 5’5” — putting her at a 
disadvantage — but cleared the next 
three heights on her first attempt, win-
ning the title. 

“After not winning the heptathlon 
I was really motivated to win high 
jump,” she said. “I wanted to win that 
event to keep a title, so it was really just 
pure competitiveness.”  

Her third-place finish in the 2009 
heptathlon was by no means a disap-
pointment, despite losing her repeat 
bid. Her score of 5,303 points was 

nearly 300 points better than her win-
ning score from last year and sur-
passed the school record she set earlier 
this season.

Rainwater began her track and field 
career in fourth grade as a member of 
the Santa Barbara Youth Track Club. 
She competed in several events, par-
ticipating in her first pentathlon in 
eighth grade. In high school, Rainwater 
excelled in the high jump and 100-
meter hurdles but competed in many 
heptathlons as a member of the club. 
She only began to train specifically for 
the event after coming to UCSD.

“Practices [for heptathalons] are 
really long,” she said. “We’ll have 
jumps, then throws, then running 
and sometimes weightlifting too. But

Take a quick look at the University 
of California athletics programs and 
UCSD sticks out like a sore thumb. It’s 
not our lack of a football team that sets 
us apart — only three UCs currently 
offer the sport. What separates UCSD 
is that — with the exception of UC 
Merced, which does not feature inter-
collegiate athletics — the Tritons are 
the only remaining team still compet-
ing in Division II.

UCSD didn’t make its move to 
Division II until 2000 and even then 
the school’s size and prestige hindered 
the Tritons’ ability to schedule match-

es against smaller colleges with less 
resources.

Less than a decade later, the same 
scenario is repeating itself — this time 
at the Division-II level. Currently, most 
of UCSD’s teams compete as the only 
non-CSU members of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association.

“In the CCAA, we’re the lone wolf 
as the only UC and are regularly out-
voted by the state schools who have 
similar interests,” Senior Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse said. 

Because of minor disputes in 
scheduling of matches and the desire 
to compete against like institutions, the 
Athletics Department is seriously con-
sidering moving up a division despite 

the current four-year moratorium on 
Division-I applicants.

“We’re always looking at possibilities 
and thinking about what to do if our 
current situation changes,” Grosse said. 
“[Athletic Director Earl Edwards] has 
talked to the Big West and other confer-
ences so we’re prepared.”

The Big West, the Tritons’ most 
likely D-I destination, is comprised of 
all-former CCAA teams with the excep-
tion of UC Irvine. 

A.S. President Utsav Gupta plans to 
put the D-I debate on the council’s all-
campus student interest poll this fall. 

A similar poll was included with 
this spring’s A.S. election ballot, prob-
ing students about their interest in an 

intercollegiate UCSD football team. Of 
the 24 percent of undergraduates who 
voted, 70 percent expressed support 
for a team, willing to pay an average of 
about $19 per quarter. 

“The students have shown their 
support,” Gupta said. “Now it’s on the 
A.S. council to react.” 

Because of Title IX — a law requir-
ing schools to match the number of 
men’s roster spots with women’s roster 
spots — a new football team would 
require cutting about 80 total male 
Tritons from various squads. Currently, 
neither the Big West nor the CCAA 
offer football programs, so finding 

Walking out of a final, most people are overcome by a certain feeling. No matter 
what happened in the previous 10 
weeks and no matter how well you 
may or may not have done in the 
class, it’s over. If you walk out of that 
final feeling like somehow you were 
able to snag a good grade, that feeling 
is amplified. And if you’re that ques-
tion kid walking out of a final, you 
start crying a little because you have 
so many more questions to ask. But 
nobody likes that kid. So screw you, 
question kid.

For everyone else, the feeling 
that it’s all done is comparable to 
one thing in sports: when your team 
wins a championship. Some people 
feel this sensation often — attaching 
themselves to whatever new team 
catches fire. These people are called 
bandwagoners and are also the only 
group deserving as much concen-
trated hatred as question kids and 
gingers. However, to follow a team 
for a long time and then, one day, 
be rewarded — there’s nothing quite 
like it. Well, being a part of that team 
probably comes close, but most of us 
lack the amazing athletic ability and
