PUTTinG PRfSSURE 
on T~f counCil 
By JAMES Q. GILMORE, Staff Wnler 

OVER the past month , take place within another twelve petitioners have been academic days. circulating the campus, "The Democratic Initiative: 
working to gather 1,800 Proposal for a New Student 
signatures in order to convene a Constitution," enumerates some 
constitutional convention. The specific proposals which the 
concerned students are members members of the Committee for 
of the Committee for the the Democratic Initiative think 
Democratic Initiative, and are will improve the AS. 
working to remedy a number of Constitution. 
the maladies they claim plague eSwit~ >-: the election 
the current Associated Students procedure to a system of 
(A.S.) government. proportional representation . 

eMove the spring elections to 
no earlier than the fourth week 
of the quarter. 

According to Section C; Article 
Vlll of the current AS. 
Constitution, "Upon receipt by 
the preSident of a petition 
Signed by fifteen percent of the 
members of the ASUCSD or 
upon passage of two-thirds of a 
council resolution to the effect 
that a constitutional convention 
be held, then the preSident shall 
schedule one within twelve 
academic days and the preSident 
shall preSide." 

The convention would be 
open to all members of the 
student body; any amendments 
or revisions would be by a 
simple majority of those in 
attendance. Once the 
convention's proposals are 
finalized, they would be placed 
on the ballot of an election to 

eAssure representation for 
historically underrepresented 
groups. 

eMake all registered UCSD 
students non-voting participants 
in both council and committe 
discussions. 

eMake all student mitiatives 
binding policy, and make it 
easier for students to initiate 
legislation by decreasing the 
amount of signatures necessary 
for an initiative and the 
minimum voter turnout. 

eMake expliCit in the 
constitution and Media Board 
Chaner the First Amendment 
rights of the new media. 

ePost and announce all 
student government decisions 
and proceedings so that the 
maximum number of interested 
students have immediate access 
to them. 

According to Greg Wilpen, 
member of the Committee for 
the Democratic Initiative, the 
most imponant issue is not that 
of proportional representation. 

In accordance with the current 
AS. Constitution, students are 
elected to fill the twenty-two A.S. 
offices on a fifty percent plus 
one basis; tile candidate

Cockburn blasts 
"Reagan cult" 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL 

A LEXANDER Cockburn, Regents' lecturer at UCSD and colunmnIst for The NatIOn , In These Tim es, and the Wall Street Journal , spoke m Peterson Hall Wednesday, Feb 18, 
about the "Contra Connection," a free lecture sponsored by the 
Progressive Students AsSOCIation (PSA) and the Assouated Students 
(AS ) 

Cockburn began by thanking the PSA and other campus 
organizations for mvltlng hIm to speak that mght on a tOpiC he 
beheves IS "bigger than Watergate" and IS "a revelation of a Reagan 
coup-d '-etat" 

Cockburn, wearing a green Jacket bearing the mscnptlon "Beat 
the DeVIl" on one sleeve, drew laughter from hiS audIence WIth 
biting coments on Reagan and others Involved In the Iran/Contra 
affair, and by callmg Nov 23,1986, the day the arms sale to Iran deal 
was revealed, "a date we should probably remember and celebrate 
every year for the rest of our hves " 

A major POInt of Cockburn's diSCUSSIon was that the cnsls In the 
Reagan White House IS good news for the Left and IS an 
opponunIty for It to combat the pohclal effects of the "Reagan cult" 

He noted that the Left has been caught by surprIse by the whole 
affair and ItS sheermagnttude "I think the problem IS I thatl the Left 
IS so used to bad news they don't know how to handle good news 
anymore," and he stressed that he was trying to get across "how 
Important the contra scandal IS" to the Left 

Cockburn quoted several articles from the L A TImes. The 
Wall Street Journal , and other penodlcals, that he said made It 
clear that the Reagan Admmlstratlon was prepanng a new 
Nicaraguan offenSive before the secret weapns shipment to Iran 
and the chanelhng of profits from theIr sale to the contras came 
to hght He said that the unfolding scandal brought PreSident 
Reagan's plans for a "mumphant, Vindicated, RambOlsm" to a 
sudden halt 

Cockburn also Cited several coven operations, among them a 
secret weapons drop In NIcaragua from CIA-owned airplanes on 
Apnlll , 1986, and mentloned rumors of other coven activities that 
he beheves are probably true 

"The Reagan system collapsed occause of the very elaborateness 
of ItS maneuvers ," he said later "What happened was that the '60s 
gOt their revenge on RORald Reagan .. 

Afterwards, Cockburn answered questIOns about Schultz' role In 
the arms-for-Iran affair and die "chances" of Impeachmg the 
PreSident Cockburn replied that ' George Schultz has managed to 
sell himself as Innocent of the scandal the truth IS he's a 
hardhner He once said, 'Nicaragua IS acancerthat must be cut 
OUt '" Cockburn also saId that a lot of groups are lookmg for any 
Illegality the PreSident Reagan could have committed that could 
prOVIde grounds for Impeachment ~

Editor's note 
Sensationalized suicide 
By MARK SANDERSON, Associate News Edilor 

Local television news views "sweeps week" as a time to beef up 
ratings by airing sensationalized "investigative" reports on rape, 
prostltution and gambling . Although the New Yom Daily News and 
the National Enquirer rely on gimmicks to secure a substantial 
readership, one wouldn't think the San Diego Union would follow 
this trend . Well, they have . 

In Sunday's San Diego section, a story entitled "Suicide site still 
issue at UCSD" was published which lacked all sense of tone , 
direction and journalistic prose . 

The srory was supposed to address the issue surrounding the 
possible construction of a barrier on the roof of Tioga Hall in order 
to prevent, or at least deter, future suicides. Instead, Gina Lubrano , 
staff writer for the Union , buried the piece under paragraphs of 
verbosity which belonged on the pages of a Harlequin Romance or in 
a scri pt for a television soap opera. 

"Neely faced south as he scaled 
the fourjoot-high wall and jumped. To 
his right, the sun glistened on the Pacific 
and to his left soared the mountains 
beyond East County." 

-San Diego Union 
"Death is pan of life at Tioga Hall," was the first sentence to greet 

the reader. It IS obvtous that most of the Union 's subscribers are 
unaware of the inordinate number of suicides occurring on the 
Muir campus, but Lubrano or her ediror should have framed the 
story in a manner which presented the facts and left OUt Writing 
which glo ri fied suicide. 

Not once, but twice in the first seven paragraphs did she make it 
clear that the four people who have taken thetr lives in the past nine 
years did so by "plunging" off the eleventh floor of Tioga Hall. 

But these examples are trivial compared to Lubrano's ponrayal of 
the most recent suicide of Todd Neely. 

She writes, "On that Saturday, most of the other dorm residents 
were still asleep or spending a lazy morning in their rooms or 
were away for the weekend. No one saw Neely as he penned a 
suicide note , tore it into tiny pieces, cut his wrists and then made 
his way from his third-floor room to the eleventh-floor patio .... 

"Neely faced south as he scaled the four-foot-high wall and 
jumped. To his right, the sun glistened on the Pacific and to his left 
soared the mountains beyond East County." 

I fail to see how anyone can consider suicide a romantic venture, 
as Lubrano's writing seems to imply. The magnificent view Neely 
enjoyed in his last moments of life is irrelevant. 

Several weeks ago, the Union printed an editorial cartoon 
depicting several children in a classroom with a caption reading, 
"Having AIDS in school isn't too bad ... . At least the teachers will 
leave us alone ." Yesterday, the paper sensationalized an issue 
which deserved responsible , thoughtful coverage . 

A house ad at the end of the article read, "Nobody opens your 
mind the way we do. Subscribe today to the San Diego Union . Call 

299-~ 1 ~ 1." Well, Union, you're right No one has opened my mind 
the way you have . 

LeI's try to report the news as news and not make a features piece 
OUt of a serious issue . A little taetgoes along way. Even the Guardian 
knows that ~

"Overextended" UCSA 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to 
the letter of Ted Herzog of 
2/ 19/ 87 regard ing the UCSA 
issue priority system with respect 
to Nicaragua . 

While I am also very 
concerned about what is 
happening in Nicaragua, as are, I 
am sure, many students at UCSD 
circumstances of which students 
should be aware have forced the 
ASUCSD to be realistic and to 

maximize its effectiveness: The 
University of California Student 
AsSOCiation , the UC student 
lobby, of which the ASUCSD is a 
member, is currently several 
thousands of dollars in the "red ," 
staff is overextended, resources 
are extremely low. Furthermore, 
currently and in the near future 
students face many serious 
problems including cuts in 
fi nancial aid and student wages, 
lack of needed improvements in 
affirmative action. 

In effect , Herzog diminishes 
the importance of these issues by 
essentially saying that UCSA 
should concern itself with 
peripheral issues such as 
Nicaragua, eve n if it is to the 
detriment of successful lobbying 
efforts on the "student issues." 
To this I respond that I am 
indeed representative of UCSD 
students when I put financial aid 
and affirmative action at a higher 
priority than Nicaragua. More 
than half of UCSD students are 
on some form of financial aid.

UCSA cannot afford except to 
deal with these issues for nQw. If 
it weren't for successful lobbying 
efforts on these important issues 
many students would not even 
have the opponuity to reap the 
many benefits of attending 
college which Herzog identified. 
Also, despite Herzog's claims I 
have never classified parking or 
beer/ party funding in the same 

category of issue importance as 
the aforementioned issues. 

I fully concur with Herzog's 
assenion that we as students 
have a responsibility to 
panicipate in "free-thinking" and 
to train ourselves to be 
conscientious citizens and 
furthermore, that the Associated 
Students should foster such 
activity. And this is precisely 
what we do. By availing funds 
for and empowering over 150 
student organizations we make it 
possible for virtuaUy every 
student to find his/her own way 
to prepare him/ herself for 
"citizenship." I encourage P.erzog 
to take advantage of the many 
political student organizations 
which in fact share his political 
concerns. With respect to 
Nicaragua, the Associated 
Students have been quite 
generous in funding several 
events dealing with Nicaragua. 
We encourage students to take 
advantage of these opponunities. 

However, in the realm of 

lobbyi ng effons the resources 
simply do not exist to lobby on 
every si ngle important foreign 
policy initiative. In a recent poll 
of a large and random sample of 
students, given UCSA's limited 
resources, significntly more 
students wanted the UCSA lobby 
to focus on student issues such 
as financial aid. Funhermore, 
Nicaragua was near the bOttom 
of the list when polled students 
ranked issues in order of 
importance. Therefore, not only 
have I made the effort to guage 

student opinion , but my 
representation of students has 
not been inappropriate. (Herzog 
implicitly makes the assumption 
that his opinion is that of all 
students.) In addition, I am 
continually in the process of 
soliciting input from dozens of 
different student organizations, 
college councils, and coops about 
their External Affairs concerns. 

In order for UCSA to be 
effective, it must narrow its focus 
and concentrate on the "meat 
and potatoes" issues which affect 
every UC student's very ability to 
even (luI!nd college. 

Herzog's myopic approach to 
the contra aid realistically would 
never be successful in lobbying 
application. The amOl,lnt given to 
the connas is minute in 
comparison with proposed 
education budget cuts. For 
effective lobbying, especially of 
our pro-contra aid San Diego 
Congressmen, it is important to

When arguing with some 
right-wing friends of mine (a 
frequent occurrence) we 
sometimes discuss the effect of 
the media upon the United 
States and Soviet Union. They 
contend that the United States 
is being turned into a helpless 
liberal giant because the 
populous is allowed to view the 
unabashed atrocities of war and 
consequently wants to avoid war 
at aU costs. They add that the 
Soviet Union will not broadcast 
their military operations to the 
people, and even if they did , the 
Soviet populus would be 
helpless in protesting it. 

Unfortunately, they make a 
valid point. There is an 
imbalance where one country's 
military is checked by its people 
and the other is not. It allows the 
Soviet military to work its will 
almost anywhere without 
consequence from the 
homefront, and somewhat 
handicaps the American forces 
in combatting them. I agree there 
have been some acts of Soviet 
imperialism where the people of 
the country in question have lied 
in hoards after the new 
government has begun operation . 
However, the Right suggests a 
solution that, instead of 
empowering the Soviet people 
with the ability to govern their 
military, will simply place all 
Americans in the same 
predicament by giving the 

American military the right to 
"filter" the media. 

Censorship has been used 
effectively in totalitarian and 
fascist nations since the 
beginnings of mass media. South 
Africa continues its racist 
policies ahnost unchecked since 
it ordered censorship of the 
press. The concentration camps 
of Nazi Germany went unnoticed 
by the Allies until the end of the 
war. War rages in Afghanistan 
today, and we, as well as the 
Soviet people, are oblivious to its 
consequences. News from 
Nicaragua is usually secondhand 
and often so politically twisted in 
one direction or the other that it 

-Matt Smiley 

is practically useless to the 
objective observer. Allowing such 
a thing as a new tool for the 
American rnilitary would have 
dire consequences and in effect 
would equal placing complete 
authority in the hands of the 
rnilitary and collaborators, and 
rnake such things as the Iran-
scam trivial in comparison to 
what could happen . 

Some people fail to realize, 
however, that the United States 
is not the only nation in the 
world willing to actively defend 
its monetary or political inte rests 
with military actions, nor is it 
the only nation in the world 

eager to force its beliefs and 
culture onto other countries. 
There are some countries that 
whole-heartedly enjoy the 
prosperity that the American-
style mixture of a slightly 
socialist government and a free 
ente rprise economy brings them, 
such as West Germany, and , 
although they dislike seeing 
American troops in their country, 
they regard them as a neceSSity. 
In other words, the presence of 
such trOops is a true defense of 
the interests of the majority of 
that nation's people and is not 
an act of imperialism, although 
on the surface it may seem that 
way. There are also instances, 
however, when the United States 
defends an oppressive 
government, such as that of 
Pinochet, against a needed 
revolution . Problems arise when 
people are unable to disce rn 
bt:tween such actions and 

Monday, February 23, 1987 5 
OPINIONS 

consider the United States as 
either a tOtaUy righteous global 
savior, or a completely evil 
conqueror. This is due simply to 
lack of unbiased information . 

We do not need censorship. 
On the contrary, what is needed 
is a more powerful news med ia. 
Regardless of what the right says, 
the media as a whole is not an 
organization devoted to bringing 
the American government to its 
knees. Except for politically 
biased publications, and the 
occasional politically biased 
reponed ar editor, the American 
media has, on the average, been 
objective and truthful in its 
reponing. The problem has been , 
in the time of war, that it has 
only been allowed access to one 
side of the fence . People see 
Americans dropping bombs, 
shooting, kiUing and destroying, 
and they see that it is horrid . 
However, this obscures force 
doing similar things a few yards 
away. If this coverage was also 
presented , the people and 
legislators could make an 
informed decision as to whether 
our forces are to continue 
fighting or not. To accomplish 
this, it is necessary to ensure 
that the media is allowed access 
to such countries, and is active 
on each opposing side. Instead 
of simply reporting propaganda , 
the atrocities claimed by an 
opposing side should be 
uncovered and documented, if 
they exist, through underground 
channels if necessary. This is a 
much sar_ " and more realistic 
method of dealing with the 
world's problems and would 
most likely promote needed 
intervention and prohibit 
unnecessary war. ~

an "elected" government - the 
Soviets have "elections" too! Even 
Ferdinand Marcos had an 
"election." 

Once again we were 
threatened with the awful specter 
of another Vietnam - a 
possibility that is all to real. 
When speaking of Vietnam, the 
Left conveniently ignores the fate 
that was suffered by the South 
Vietnamese people because the 
United States abandoned them. 
Perhaps the contras are bad . The 
Left claimed the Thieu Regime 
was corrupt and bad too. Yet, no 
reasonable person acquainted 
with the facts can claim that 
Vietnam is now better off 
because the United States 
withdrew its support. There are • 
thousands of people who should 
hide their heads in shame that 
they once cried "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi 
Minh , NVA is going to win." 
They did, and a country that was 
once relatively prosperous is now 
in misery because of it. But once 
again:the Left wants us to 
abandon the fight against a 
communist revolution . This time , 
however. it's in our own 
backyard . if the contras are 
abandoned and defeated, we can 
expect the Left to continue on 
their merry way, ignoring the 
atrocities of leftist regimes, 
dancing off to doom some other 
country, such as El Salvador or 
Honduras to Marxist rule.

Getting animated in La Jolla 
By DAVE FORMAN. 5rajf Wnrer 

On a drizzly Sunday afternoon 
In February, in front of the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
An. pike Decker, dressed tn an 
oversized black and white 
cowboy outfit, looms in the 
lobby, ready to promote the 1987 
Festival of Animation. His outfit 
complete with whip and what 
must be a thiny gallon hat. 
makes him look larger than life . 
like one of the anoon 
characters flashing across the 
s reen Inside the theater. But 
Spike IS more than a canoon 
character, JUSt as the films being 
shown Inside are more than Just 
cartoons. Rather. they are 
modern works of animation by 
today's premier anIsts. 

The festival has been 
showcasing these anists since 
coming to La Lolla in 1980, 
hoping to show that animation is 
not Simply chlldren's film . but an 
Important visual medium. Spike 
Decker is half of the team of 
Mike and Spike (the other half 
bemg Mike Gribble). whose 
appreciation for animated short 
films began in the early 
seventies. Their story is as 
Interesting as many of the films 
they now show. 

The<)rigins of the Festival of 
Animation lie in a 1950s revue 
style band called "Sterno and the 

Fractions 

Flames" m Rlvcrsldc. California. 
While attcnding River idc Junior 
College. Spike was a mcmber of 
the band. as well as their hief 
promoter. In 1974. Spike met 
Mike. who was at the time 
working at a B. Dalton Bookstore. 
PromOtion Interested them both. 
and soon they began to promOte 
special cvents around the ollege 
circuit. Their interests turned to 
inema toward the late seventies. 

when they began [0 promOte cult 
films, such as Killg of Hearts and 
Slaughrer House FtI'e. Before 
running the feature films they 
would show short animated 
features. serving to warm up the

crowd. These early shorts, such 
as Betty Boop cartoons and 
music videos, quickly became as 
popular as the features 
themselves. In 1979, they put 
together a compilation of shorts 
in Riverside. and it proved {Q be 
very successful. Mike explains: "It 
was a logical progression. We try 
to pay very close artemion to 
what people want to see and 
people wanted to see shorts." 

A year later, in 1980, they 
brought their new Festival to the 
La Jolla Museum of Contemporay 
An, where it has resided since. 
Mike explained the move to San 
Diego simply: "This is the good 

Exposing new layers 
By MONICA SZURMUK-SUSMEL 

T HE fact that Jackie considers me a fairy godmother sometimes 
troubles me. When she talks 
about how much gOing to Peru 
means to her and how some 
· supernatural" force put me 111 
her way to lead her to her 
destiny, I can't help feeling 
uneasy. I feel an Itch In my solar 
plexus, but anyway, that. 
accordmg to Jackie. IS good (It 
would be awful If I felt It In my 
coronary). 

I met her at a New Year's pany 
almost three years ago. Bueno£ 
Aires was as sticky as it can be 
in January and we were 
celebratIng our first year 111 
democracy after even yea rs of 
military dictatorship. The fervor 
of the new freedom pushed us 
Into the now safe streets, the 
cofTee houses and to the 

nverbank. At nme in the 
mornmg, we all said good-bye 
artc r a COpiOUS croissant 
breakfast and Jackic said, "I'll 
phone you." 

She did too. She was very 
lonely. I liked her. She plays 
wonderful musIc and we had a 
lot in common. January is the 
first full summcr month m thc 
southcrn hemisphere. Together 
with the heat and the resolutions 
come new friendships , new loves 
and new attitudes 

In ummer. people arc marc 
prone to thoughtles deCISions 
and maybe that's why Jackie 
deCided to gi ve up the vacations 
m Europe her wealthy father had 
offered her and JOin me and a 
bunch of ,ldventurOu5 fllend~ 
acros~ rhe border, by land to 
Peru and Bohvla 

Jackie's metamorphosis took 
place In Machu Picchu. She had 
already been haunting vegetanan 
places for a long time and she 
had seen naturalist doctors; but 
it was only when faced with the 
glamour, the hugeness and the 
silent cry of the last Inca ruins , 
that her hean opened and he 
gave herself up to her new being. 

Since then , Jackie has been 
trying and discard ing new 
fabncs, new foods. new 
mediCines. new therapies, new 
must cal Instruments and new 
people. It would be very hard to 
dr.lwa picture of what her life IS 
Iikc today. Jackie IS 111 search of 
thc ultimate "natura!." the 
ultimate "healthy " She cats

life." The decision to stage the 
festival in the museum was to 
add validity to the medium. "The 
museum takes [the shorts] out of 
the comext of being just a 
cartoon" Spike suggests. Over the 
last seve ral years, the Festival of 
Animation (which now has a 
sta te copyright on its name) has 
increased in its popularity, 
adding additional dates and 
weekends to the La Jolla run. It 
has also expanded to other 
cities, with shows now in San 
francisco, Santa Barbara and 
Long Beach. Negotiations are 
being worked out now for a 
show in !lostOn, and looking 
ahead to the future . Mike and 
Spike envision shows In 

ew York. Denver. and possibly 
somewhere' in Europe. 

Side by side with the show's 
increasing populanry is its 
increasing respectibihty as a 
legitImate forum for new anlSts 
to get thei r work seen. Mike 
expounds: "My theory is the 
more attractive the festival , th at 
is to say, the more places we go, 
the more interested film makers 
are m having their films shown 

churches; she takes yoga lessons, 
tal chi lessons. shiatzu les ons; 
she sees naturopaths, follows 
lheir directions blindly for 
some time , then abandons rhem . 

Jackie IS al 0 getllng ready for 
the great take-off: the day when 
she will bc able to flee Buenos 
Aires and live lose to nature . 
The day when she Will be able 10 

here." In a shon time they have 
received a reputation of 
excellence through hard work 
and high energy. for every 
sixteen films in a given show, 
almost four hundred are 
considered. Viewing these films 
takes them around the world, 
including a recent trip that Mike 
took to Yugoslavia, where he 
found the Czechoslavakian film 
"Bartakiad ," which is currently 
showing at this year's Festival. 

By expanding the Festival's 
scope, they have been ablc to . 
diverSify their business. They are 
offering a scholarship to the 
most promising new animator at 
Cal Ans in Valencia. which will 
be announced in May. They also 
helped finance this year's crowd 
favorite, "Snookles: which is 
billed as the "Bambi Meets 
Godzilla" of the 1980s. Cal Arts 
Artist Juliet Stroud had run Out of 
money after completing a pencil 
draft of the short. Mike and 
Spike both saw its potential and 
agreed to help finance the 
production costs. "It's good 
business ... and it's a nice way to 
help somebody out," Mike 
comments. "Snookles" was 
subsequently picked up by 
Pyramid films for distribution. 
"Everyone wins in this case," 
Mike adds. After this success, the 
Festival hopes to finance more 
shons in the future . 

The future of the Festival of 
Ammation as a whole is looking 
bnght. In late July and early 
August, they will return to La 
Jolla to.put on a "Best of the 
fest" show; a visual greatest hits 
package from the last several 
Festivals. Though the line-up has 
not yet been finalized. some 
likely candidates may be "C1osed 
Mondays," "The Big Snit ," last 
year's visually stunning 
"Paradise ." and the 1985 
Academy Award winner 
"Charade." A likely candidate 
from this year's show is John

Las eter's "Luxo jr .... which was 
Just nominated for an Oscar. and 
is the first computer generared 
animated shorr to receive such 
an honor. 

This year's show has been 
particularly pleasing to the 
organ izers of the Festival because 
the subject matter covered is so 
diverse; from the CUt out an of 
Jim Bla hfield' Talking Heads 
video "And She Was" to "Pig 
Bird." a hilarious Canadian film 
which pOignantly expresses the 
importance of observing 
Canadian customs' regulations. 
Paul Driesen's film "On Land. At 
Sea and in the Air" is perhaps 
th is year's most innovative film 
(save "Luxo Jr."), as it splits the 

screen into thirds, and 
si multaneously tells three 
different stories before rying 
them together at thc end . 

Despite the dreariness of this 
drizzly La Jolla day, the mood 
inside the museum is 
appropnately festive, with Spike 
prancing around in cowboy 
attire, and Mike advisi ng the 
crowd before the show begins to 
collectively shout "Jeez Louise" to 
all latecomers. The chant is 
heard throughtout the first tWO 
films, as people drift in late. The 
success of the show is due 
largely to this rapport with the 
audicnce. and the fact that Mike 
and Spike are mmivated by the 
crowd and hy the anIsts whose 
works thcy so proudly Jisplay.

Parking Meter Resolution 
Submitted by: Dave Marchick 

1. Whereas. 5000 students, staff. and faculty signed a petition demanding the 
reinstitution of nickel, dime, and quarter meters, and 
2. Whereas, Quarter only meters impede the accessability of short tenn metered 
parking, and 
3. Whereas, Quarter only meters defy customary presumption of use and operations, 
and 
4. Whereas. Quarter only meters promote vehicular traffic by forcing drivers to 
search for unexpired meters, and 
5. Whereas. Quarter only meters burden campus retail outlets by parkers soliciting 
change. and 
6. Whereas. Quarter only meters act in denying public need , and 
7. Whereas, the decision to change the meters from nickel, dime, and quarter to 
quarter. only was not considered by the Parking and Transportation Alternatives AdViSOry 
Committee. 

Therefore let it be resolYui, that the Associated Students urge Vice Chancellor 
Relyea, Police Chief Anderson, Director Umstead. and Members of the Parking and 
Transportation Advisory Committee to reinstate nickel. dime.and quarter parking 
meters on the UniversIty of California, San Diego Campus. 

Campus Shuttle Resolution 
Submitted By: Dave Marchick 

Whereas, Students have shown suppott for an on-campus shuttle system, and 
Whereas, Last Spring. in a referendum question on the ballot, 60 percent of students

Whereas, A shuttle would Significantly reduce travel time for peripheral parking lots 
located on the perimeter of the campus, and 
Whereas, the Strawman Report does not caU for parking structures centrally located 
until 1991. and 
Whereas. Such a shuttle would reduce the current parking problem. and 
Whereas. Such a shuttle would increase safety for students, staff and faculty , and 
Whereas, Such a shuttle is economically feasible . 

Therefore let it be resolved, that the Associated Students urge Vice Chancellor 
Relyea, Police Chief Anderson, Director Umstead , and Director Steindorf, and Members

outlined in the Strawman Repon to be implimented by Fall Quaner, 1987

Baggers -splits weekend BJ's Chicago Pizzeria 
Sports Quiz By KURT BEll 

·We'll juSt forget about this 
one," were the words of baseball 
coach LyLe Yates after being 
blown 19-0 by Cal State Los 
Angeles Friday, their second 
crushing loss in as many days, 
Well , forgotten it was as the 
Tritons c hanged gears and roUed 
all over Cal Sta te Stanislaus, 18-0, 
in a grudge match Saturday. 

Yates said the win was 
"extremely satisfying" because it 
was Stanislaus that knocked 
them out of the playoffs in the 
regional finals last year. "Now the 
NCAA has to respect us: Yeats 
added, "It (the win) really 
increased OUt playoff chances." 

The Triton scoring slump 
ended abruptly when JJ. Fisher 
hit a grand slam in the first 
inning Saturday. Jim Morreen 
and Bobby Natal also homered , 
giving the Tritons a 10 run lead 
after half an inning. 

Rick Nowak (4-0) pitched a 
complete game striking out seven 
and walking JUSt one in the 
process. 

Saturday was a pleasant thaw 
after a cold wind froze Triton 
infielding, hitting and pitching 
the previous day. UCSD 
committed eight errors and gave 
up three runs on wild pitches 
while gaining any six hilS on 
offense. Statting pitcher, Mike 
Morgan, gave up eight runs 
before he was relieved after six 
innings. In the seventh , Cal State 
LA scored II runs, the wind 
picked up blowing over music 
from the T.G. and the entire 
crowd of 60 or so knew there 
was a better place to be. But then 
all of that is forgotten . 

Though the Tritons are 
currently 5-5, playoff hopes are 
optimistic. The most difficult 

part of their season is now over. 

* * * * * 

After Last year's travesty, Yates 
is very pleased with the position 
his team is in. The Tritons are 
off to a good stan with a 5-5 
record, and Yates is nor 
surprised. UCSD only lost two 
starters from Last year's 21-6, 
including the powerhiuing Dan 
DiMascio, who was drafted by 
the Detroit Tigers laSt year. 

The 1987 edition of the UCSD 
baseball team is led by the 
omnipotent Bob Natal, who has 
instilled such fear into opposing 
pitchers this year that teams an' 
taking the bat out of his hands 
instead of having to pitch to 
him. 

"Pitchers are pitching around 
Bobby instead of having to face 
him," said Yates, "so he's only 
getting a couple official at bats 
Bobby's a four year starter ana 
he understands the situation and 
is willing to take walks for the 
team." 

One hitter that has eluded the 
suspicious opposition is Glen 
Turnipseed, who set a couple of 
school records last week with a 
superhuman performance that 
may have big league SCOUtS 
hovering around Olsen Field. 

Turnipseed is the first baseball 
player at UCSD to hit for the 
cycle, which includes, for the 
baseball illiterate, a single, double , 
triple .. and homerun. This 
proli lic production resulted in 
nine rbi's, also a new school 
record . 

In only losing two starters, 
Yates is not worried about the 
offensive production of his team. 
After leading the nation with a 
.964 fielding percentage, Yates 
also isn't worried about his team 
defense. The team's pitching 
was not yet a point of concern, 
and Yates sees his pitching 
having improved from Last year, 
due to some major league help 
from some big league experience.

Players face a big burden 
if they don't play up to par 

After each game for the Crow Point (Ind.) 
High School women's basketball team, the least 
productlve player is forced to pay a heavy price. 
The coach, Tom May, has a proficiency point 
system for the starters, and the girl with the 
lowest point total, win or lose, must carry with 
her a bowling ball the entire next school day. 

The ball is sixteen pounds and IS chained to 
the player's ankle. It is held on with a paq,lock, 
bringing the total weight to about twenty pounds. 

May must know what he's doing, because in 
his seven years as coach he has gone 147-22 
and won TWO state championships. 

Here is Satchel Paige's "Paige's Rules for 
Staying Young:" 

I. AVOId fried meats, whIch angry up the 
blood . 

2 If your stomach disputes you, lie down and 
paci fy It with cool thoughts. 

) . Keep the juices nOWIng by jangling around 
gently as you move. 

4. Go very light on th e vices, such as carrying 
on in society. The social ramble ain't restful. 

5. Avoid running at all times. 
6. Don't look back. Something might be 

gaining on you. 

"Mamie can hIt just as good right-handed as 
he can left-handed. He's just naturally 
amphibious." 

When asked his cap size, he repleid: "How do 
1 know? I'm not In shape yet." 

When asked if he wanted his pizza cut into 
four slices or eight: "Better make it four. I don 't 
think I can eat eight." 

When a lady told him that he looked cool, 
despite the day's warmth: "Thank you, ma'am. 
You don't look so hot yoursclr." 

On a resta urant in New York "/t 's so crowded, 
nobody goes th ere anymore." 

Acknnwledging fa ns on Yogi Berra Day: "\ 
want to thank everybody who made this day 
necessary:' 

Danyl Stra~ny, New York Mets rightfielder, 
has found a way to supplement his meager 
income. Not only did he receive $7,000 to 
appear at a card ollectors' show, but he charged 
$4 for each autograph that he signed. 

Here are some of baseball's most degrading 
nicknames taken from Baseball's Greatesl In sults:

laCrosse 
Triumph 
By MARK PRESSMAN 

U CSD's women La Crosse team played TWO matches Saturday at the super-
computer field , winning both 7-6 
and 8-5. 

Jennifer Cutler (4 goals) ana 
team captain Karen Bergan led 
the Tritons in the first game 
against the University of 
California , Irvine. The playing 
was fierce at times. and always 
quick. Although the women wear 
no pads or protective masks, the 
play is by no means always 
secure. And so the team is 
always alert and on their toes. 
"We try to do the best we can in 
all phases of the game ," said 
Captain Karen Bergan.

PIIbIldty mille poeUbIe by I grant from 
Playing TWO and sometimes 

three or four games in a day is 
no easy feat , as one of the Triton I-------------------------l 
leading scorers remarked, "I'm so 

451-"49 
sore, I could use a massage." 

La Crosse was originated by 
the North American Indians, and 
is now played competitively in 
many parts of the world. The art 
of driving to score, cutting, 
seems to have been better 
mastered by the UCSD women 
than those of UC Irvine. In the 
7 -6 win, UCSD's defense showed 
its strength, too, holding the first 
string squad of UC Irvine to one 
goal before letting the second 
string players have a shot. Often 
UCI had penetration and came 
Ufl- empty-handed. 

Against Claremont, the La 
Crosse women of UCSD worked 
well again with exceUent 
performances turned in by, 
again, Jennifer Cutler and Marty 
Blair. The team is looking 
confidently forward to a multi-
team tournament soon to come. 

Coached by Lytia CaIman, the 
La Crosse women also include, 
Suzy Canada, Dana Crompton, 
Raquel Dobel, Laura Freedman, 
Marcie Goldman, Terrie Rowen, 
Sharon Lutz, T eri Marchetta, Ann 
Moses, Minsook Oh, Debbie 
Page, Tara Pratt, Gail Richardson 
and Tracey Gram. ~

"Tom House, the pitching 
coach of the Texas Rangers, 
asked me if we had an extra 
buUpen to use: explained Yates. 
"He was going to work ~th 
some of the Padres pitchers and 
the situation worked out great 
because in return he worked 

• with our pitching staff." 
YateS was also able to get more 

big league help by getting former 
Philadelphia Phillies' and 
Chicago Cubs' pitcher Warren 
Brusstar to also work with the 
Triton pitchers. 

All this has Yates extremely 
pleased. "I can't see any other 
schools we play getting any 
better pitching instruction than 
we are ," said Yates. 

Leading this year's pitching 
staff is sophomore sensation 
Rick Nowak, who has already 
compiled a 4-0 record . Nowak 
started turning heads Last year as 
a freshmen when he pitched the 
first no-hitter in school's history. 

"OveraU we have a really good 
group," said Yates, "and with the 
nucleus from last year's group 
and a solid core of freshmen, I 
think we1l have a great season 
this year." ~
