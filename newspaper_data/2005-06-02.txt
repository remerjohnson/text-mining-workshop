Tech workers walk out on jobs 
By WlLUAM CHING 

Staff Writer 
The University of California 

will continue negotiating a new 
contract with the University 
Professional Tec hni ca l 
Employees and Communications 
Workers of America union after 
its members walked off the job 
May 26 to protest what the union 
has called the university's unfair 
labor practices. 

Approximately 100 UPTE-
CWA members, faculty members 
and students came out to pro-
test at the Villa La Jolla Drive 
and Scholar's Lane intersection 
and at Hillcrest Medica l Center, 
according to UPTE-CWA San 
Diego Chapter President Carolan 
Buckmaster.

The university said it is dedi-
cated to negotiations, even after 
the strike. 

"Despite the union 's unl awful 
conduct, the university remains 
dedicated to achieving a fair 
contract for its employees, and 
will not allow UPTE's tactics 
to interfere with negotiations," 
the university stated in a press 
release. "The university will con-
tinue to invite UPTE to consider 
the use of a neutral state mediator 
to help facilita te agreement." 

The union rejected a May 
20 university wage offer, which 
Buckmaster said fell below union 
expectations. 

UCSD psychiatry department 

research assistant and UPTE-
CWA California PresidentJelger 
Kalmijn said that the university's 
offer did not include step increas-
es, which are equivalent to merit 
pay, until J anuary 2008. 

"These step increases tell 
people we value you [when) you 
stay," Kalmijn said . "Without 
them, it is a very strong disincen-
tive for people. Two-thirds of my 
co-workers see no future working 
for the University of California ." 

A campus supervisor, who 
spoke on the condition of ano-
nymity, said she came out to 
the trike support her employees, 
whom she said are underserved 
by the university. 

University Centers 
expansion back on track 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

The University Centers 
expansion and renovation, a 
project increasing the size of 
both Student Center and Price 
Center, is progressing accord-
ing to schedule despite weather 
setbacks, according to construc-
tion officials. 

"The construction contrac-
tor is making up time a fter a 

wet winter," University Centers 
Director Gary R. Ratcliff stated 
in an e-mail. 

Expa nsion on Student 
Center broke ground last fall, 
beginning the first phase of a 
two-part project. Phase one is 
expected to finish, as planned, 
within the months of October 
and November of this year, 
according to Ratcliff.

"A starter's wage shouldn't 
stay at the same wage for three 
years ," she said. "We all take 
our work seriously, and turnover 
affects the quality of our work." 

The turnover rate - the rate 
at which employees leave their 
job - has reached "crisis" pro-
portions with an annual rate of 33 
percent, according to the union. 
It takes an average of six months 
to train new research associates, 
the supervisor said. 

She also said that it is get-
ting much more difficult to hire 
experienced research associates 
and other staff as a result of low

Recording compani es charged 
two more unidentified UCSD stu-

work known as Internet2 in a 
second wave of lawsuits filed in 
federal court late last week. 

The new charges bri ng the 
total number of campus defen-
dants accused of file sharing to 27, 
adding to the 25 initial suits that 
were first made public last month. 

Recordi ng Industry Association

students from any single . college 
campus. 

"As long as students continue to

clear that there are consequences

J,Board hears one SRTV 
grievance, rejects others 
Station claims A.S . Council 

violated neutrality policy 
By MADEUNE PHIWPS 

Staff Writer 

A Student-Run Television griev-
ance filed against the AS. Council 
will be heard at an undeternuned 
time next year by the A.S. all-campus 
Judicial Board, according to a state-
ment issued by the board. 

The grievance focuses on an AS. 
resolution approved following the 
February airing of pornographic 
material on the SRTV program 
"Koala TV," prompting multiple 
student complaints to the station. 

SRTV officials claim that the A.S. 
resolution violated the television sta-
tion's charter. 

"Koala TV" is a spin-off of 
the campus publication the Koala, 
which has printed sexually explicit 
and racial material in the past. The 
A.S. Council responded to the air-
ing with a resolution, which was 
passed in March, condemning the 
"broadcast of inappropriate material 
onSRTV." 

The judicial board initially dis-
nUssed SRTV's grievances, which 
also claimed that the resolution vio-
lated a UC Office of the Pres.ident 
policy requiring neutrality in media 
content on the part of the AS. 

Council. 
However, follo\l~ng a meeting 

with staff from SRT I and the Koala 
on May 23 , the b< .lTC1 decided to 
hear the grievance case based on 
the alleged violati n of the SRTV 
charter. 

"I think that all parties were really 
helpful in contributing ideas on what 
they wanted to see," Judicial Board 
C hair Diana Hung said. 

The judicial board did, however, 
dismiss both SRTV's and the Koala's 
respective accusations regarding 
UCOP policy because they were 
outside of the board's jurisdiction, 
Hung said. The judicial board rec-
ommended that SRTV and the Koala 
take their case to the UCOP griev-
ance body. 

SRTV and the Koala fi led multiple 
grievances, including those aga inst 
A.S. Adviser Lauren Weiner, for-
mer AS. Commissioner of Student 
Services Kian Maleki and tr.e COlm -
cil . 

Weiner was accused of "failing to 
advise AS. properly" and "not exer-
cising neutrality" in her position as 
adviser, according to Andrew T ess, 
an SRTV station managcr next year.

Strike: Workers and UC 
to continue negotiations 

continued from page / 
starting wage. 

Because many UC staff mem-
bers do leave, the supervisor said 
that the university's quality of 
research coul d drop. 

"Experience counts for the 
quality of the work," she said. 

Although the university called 
the strike "unlawful," the union 
does not fear legal recourse 
from its actions, according to 
Buckmaster. 

T he university had previ-
ously threatened to file a com-
plaint with the California Public 
Employment Board, but in its 
latest press release, there is no 
IIlention of any forthcoming 
legal action. 

"The university said it before," 
Buckmaster said, regarding legal 
threats. "It is a ' boy who cries 
wolf' situation. Over time, it 
loses its effectiveness." 

The strike was a declaration 
of the situation's magnitude, 
according to Buckmaster. 

"We are hoping that the 
strike will help [the universi-
ty] realize how serious things 

are," Buckmaster said. "It was a 
statement saying that people are 
unhappy." 

Approximately 90 percent of 
union members attending the 
strike were new to walkouts, 
according to Buckmaster. That 
fact showed that the union is dis-
ciplined in its cause, she said. 

"It brought cohesion to our 
members ," Buckmaster said. 
"[The union] covers many job 
tides and a lot of people who 
wouldn 't normally strike came 
out. I was impressed." 

Kalmijn said that low wages 
were creati ng a "slow erosion of 
university research," which ulri-
mately ends up hurting tudents. 

"A prison guard makes 50 
percent more than J do, and I 
have worked for the university 
for 16 years," Kalmijn said. "I 
love my job, and I work hard, but 
there is no pay." 

University and UPTE repre-
sentatives plan to meet in early 
June to continue bargaining.

Grievance: Complaint 
against Weiner dismissed 

continued from page / 
However, the judicial board dis-

IIlissed the case because the board 
ntled that it only has jurisdiction 
over elected officials, and not over 
AS. employees such as Weiner. 

SRTV and the Koala also filed a 
grievance against Maleki for "failing 
to accurately represent the interests 
of SRTV' when he proposed the 
A.S. resolution that condemned 
the broadcast of pornography on 
SRTV, Tess said. SRTV also asked 
for an official apology from Maleki, 
according to the judicial board's 
statement. 

Because Maleki is no longer 
an A.S. officer, he is also outside 
ot the judicial Uoard's jurisdiction, 
!-lung said. 

Maleki said his position this past 
y~a r warranted his decisions. 

"I acted appropriately and with-
in the realm of my office," Maleki 
said. "The [members of dle] Koakl 

should learn to Ijve within the con-
sequences of their actions." 

KDala editor and John Muir 
College senior Steve York dis-
agreed with the judicial board's 
decision to dismiss some of the 
grievances. 

"I certainly feel that our little 
freshman judicial board had no idea 
what they were doing," York said. 
"I'm disappointed [with the deci-
sion] ." 

-me hearing of the grievances 
against the AS. Council will most 
likely take place at the beginning 
of the fall quarter, according to 
Hung. 

"1 was satisfied with the pro-
ceedings," Hung said. "I hope that 
evetyone will be able to accept 
the decision and pursue their own 
goals."

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
Meeting .5 - June 1 

Public Input 
Many students from the 

Academic Success Program spoke 
regarding the A.S . Council's sug-
gestion to reduce the amount 
of money allocated to A.S.P. 
Speakers reminded A.S. coun-
cilmembers of the referendum 
passed in 2001 to fund $1 per 
student per quarter and requested 
that the program be funded the 
full amount. Despite the approval 
of the referendum, there was not 
sufficient voter turnout to lock 
in the amount of money allow-
ing councilmembers to decide the 
allocation amount. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
ItemK 

The council pa sed by con-
sensus an allocation of $333 from 
Student Conference Travel and 
$55 from General Unallocated to 
the College Republicans for their 
summer conference. T he council 
was able to pass the legislation due 
to recent bylaw changes allowing 
funding of summer competitions 

and conferences. 

ltemL 
T he A.S. Council suspend-

ed Finance bylaw Article 8, 
Section E in order to fund the 
Black Student Union and the 
Vietnamese Student Association's 
events during Welcome Week. 
The funding was previously 
excluded due to the timing of the 
events falling between academic 
years, but the suspension passed 
in an 18-0-2 vote. 

Old Business 
Item N 

The council passed a resolu-
tion urging UCSD professors to 
support student services by using 
the Soft Reserves enterprise for 
course readers and requested the 
assistance of the Academic Senate 
to encourage professors to do the 
same. Soft Reserves Task Force 
member Christine Ta reported 
that the task force concluded cer-
tain aspects of A.S. oft Reserves 
and Lecture Notes should be 
combined in the future .

UC pr.am promotes 
education, technology 

A large coalition between the 
University of Califomia and sev-
eral partners, including Gov. Amold 
Schwarzenegger and the Califomia 
State University, aims to cultivate a sci-
entifically sound woncrorce in Califomia 
by providing college students incentive 
to enter the education career path. 

Specifically, the UC system plans 
to establish the "Califomia Teach" pro-
gram, which would increase the the 
yearly production of credentialed sci-
ence and mathematics high school 
teachers, the UC Office of the President 
stated in a press release. Under the 
program, UC undergraduate students 
would receive, in four years, the training 
required for teaching secondary school 
science or math curriculum, as well 
as a bachelo(s degree in fields of sci-
ence, mathematics or engineering. The 
idea to promote science and technol-
0F:f careers, which fuels a large part of 
California's economy, was birthed in the 
govemo( s "compact" with the CSU and 
UC systems in May 2004. 

'11 Califomia is to be a leader in 
tomorrcw's economy, we need to put 
more emphasis on science and math 
instruction," Schwarzenegger stated in 
a press release. 1his science and math 
initiative will expand the efforts of our 
UC and CSU systems, with the goal of 
graduating at least four times as many 
new science and math teachers by the 
year 2010. The California Science and 
Math Initiative is the right investment for 
Califomia's future." 

"California Teach" Vvlll incorporate 
several elements, including loan-for-
giveness pr~rams for partiopants ....tID 
teach extensively after college gradua-
tion and mentoring from professional 
teachers. 

UC Davis invents light 
system for elderlY 

The Califomia Lighting Technology 
Center, a research and development 
program at UC Davis, developed a 
lighting system that will make energy 
use more efficient and improve safety 
conditions for the elderly. 

The ne\N system uses a light-emit-
ting diode night~igf:lt with an orange 

~ow, which prOVldes the necessary 
amount of light to promote sight but 
not enough to disorient the retina. The 
light fIXture uses less than one watt of 
power and is fluorescent according 
to CLTC Director Michael Siminovitch. 
Because the elderly have weak f!:.!e-
sight regular lights that are too strong 
or too dim can severely disorient them, 
Siminovitch said. The new light system, 
however, will provide just the right 

Ben Juwono/Guordion 

amount of light 
The system is expected to cost 

about $200. Davis is currently negotiat-
ing with companies to manufacture 
the product and filing a patent for the 
invention. 

A.S.P. members dispute 
budget cuts 

Several members of the Academic 
Success Program protested the AS. 
Council's plans to divert program 
funding to various other line items in 
the student organization budget at a 
June 1 meeting. Initially, the council 
had planned to move $6,500 from 
A.S.P., claiming that the program had 
more than $15,000 left In its budget 
However, discussion of proposal was 
postponed after A.S. executives found 
that the financial reports thf!:.! were 
provided with were outdated, according 
to AS.P. Executive Director Teny Le. The 
current amount left over in AS.P:s bud-
get is actually approximately $4,000, 
he said. 

'The thing is that the business office 
paperwork is slow," Le said. "The figures 
didn't account for the spending during 
this quarter or the cost of book lending 
during spring~ 

A.S.P. is an A.S. service that provides 
programs such as book lending, men-
toring and exam archives. The service 
is funded by a referendum passed in 
200 1, ....tIich adds a student activity fee 
of $1 per student per quarter. Under 
the referendum's language, the amount 
directed to A.S.P. is under A.S. discre-
tion, according to leo Currently, there is 
$40,000 in the A.S.P. budRet 

During early budget talks, A.S.P. was 
cut by $2,000 in order to add more 
funding to a coI~ festivals line ~em. 
AIthouRh the initial cut was under-
standably necessary, further cuts to 
A.S.P. would be detrimental to the 
program, le said. A.S.P. served about 
300 students per quarter in the past 
year, an A.S.P. annual report stated. 
In order to create more accountability 
in A.S.P. finances and ensure that the 
program's budget will no longer be 
questioned, le said he plans to add line 
items within the AS.P. budget, provide 
frequent reports to the A.S. Council and 
provide statistical data of the program's 
usa8e among students. The AS. Council 
deaded to postpone discussion of the 
debate until the next academic year. 
AS. President Christopher Sweeten said 
that he would focus more attention on 
A.S.P. in the future. 

HI will be working with the director 
on business plans for the service to 
insure that all monf!:.! that is allocated to 
A.S.P. is used in a productive manner: 
he stated in an ~il. We must con-
tinue to support services that provide 
retention to students on this campus~

RIAA: New lawsuits focus 
on student 'i2hub' users 
continued from page / 

ing the new filings. "With the 
multitude of legal music alterna-
tives available to students today, 
there is simply no excuse for this 
ongoing illegal downloadi ng on 
college campuses.» 

Court records listing the IP 
addresses of the new defendants or 
the songs they are accused of shar-
ing were not immediately avail-
able. 

However, RJAA spokeswoman 
Jenni Engebretsen said the newest 
suits target users of the popular 
"i2hub" applica-
tion. 

" 

predict a timeline for proceedings 
in each case. 

Wood did say that ResNet had 
turned over records in early May 
in response to subpoenas issued 
by the Motion Picture Association 
of America, which filed a separate 
federal claim against rwo UCSD 
students for illegally distributing 
movies. 

MPAA's action accuses two 
students, whose IP addresses have 
already been disconnected, of 
uploading the movies "Be Cool" 
and "Hotel Rwanda" in late March 

and early Apri l, 
respectively. 

Recording com-
panies have al ready 
secured out-of-
court settlements 
with approximately 
70 of the 405 stu-
dents charged last 
month. 

While the stu-
dems targeted in 
the ini tial suits 
sha red an aver-
age of 2,300 songs 
each, the two new-
est defendants kept 
far fewer songs on 

[T]here is simply no 
excuse far this 
ongoing illegal 

dmvnloodingon 
college campuses. " 

Engebretsen 
said the RlAA 
suits have been 
effective at reduc-
ing peer-to-peer 
file-sharing, forc-
ing students to 
think rwice before 
engaging in the 
illegal activity. 

"There is no 
doubt that our 
initial round of 
lawsuits has cre-
ated a heightened 
awareness of this

their computer, though the num-
ber was still "egregiously" large, 
Engebretsen said. 

However, UCSD has not yet 
received subpoenas seeking to 
identify the students charged in 
the first wave of suits, according 
to Academic Computing Services 
Director Tony Wood, meaning 
that their exact identities are likely 
still unknown to RIAA. 

Beca.use the suits were among 
hundreds of others filed in dif-

f~rent federal court jurisdictions, 
Engebretsen said it was difficult to 

problem with both students and 
universities," she said. 

The university, however, 
has not made any changes to its 
Internet-lise policies nor has it 
blocked access to peer-to-peer 
software, as the RIM had urged, 
according to Wood . 

"There have been no pol icy 
changes related to this subject and 
I don't know of any in the works," 
he stated in an e-mail.

A.S. business enterprises losing profits 
Iy IENJAMIN IAJn'LfTT 

Senior Staff Writer 

A.S. enterprise revenue carryover 
has decreased significantly from last 
year, according to documents the 
A.S. Council used to draft next year's 
operating budget. The slump has 
raised concerns among current and 
former AS. councilmembers over 
the financial future of student-run 
business enterprises at the campus. 

"On a purely observarionallevel, 
I see us as breaking even or per-
haps even dipping below," 2003-04 
A.S. Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan said. "In 
the management of the enterprises 
there isn't the level of innovation 
necessary to keep these profits." 

To stem the decrease in profits, 
Cogan said the council should take 
a variety of measures to help jump-
s.tart the student-run enterprises. 

"In any business you must keep 
innovating to compete," Cogan 
said. "The first thing that needs to 
happen is to write a full professional 
business plan outlining the progress 
for the next four years." 

However, it is unlikely prof-
it margins will cimtinue to fa ll , 
according to AS. Vice President 
Internal and 2004-05 Commissioner 
of Enterprise Operations Angela 
Fornero. Moreover, Fornero also 
said that much is already being done 
in an attempt to bolster profits. 

"I can guarantee that we have 
been working closely with the 
enterprises this year in implement-
ing changes and maximizing prof-
its," Fornero stated in an e-maiL 

Some of the changes include 
increasing marketing, allowing 
students to reserve their textbooks 
online, altering the pricing struc-
ture and the exchange policy at 
A.S. Soft Reserves and attempting 
to lower overhead costs, according 

Greg Dale/Guordian 
rmllls rush: Students purchase lecture notes from Lecture Notes, an AS: enterprise. 
Executives plan to merge Lecture Notes and Soft Reserves to increase profitability. 
to Fornero. At the center of the 
financial struggle is Soft Reserves, 
which, more than any other busi-
ness, has seen its profi ts eroded by 
greater usage of off-campus ven-
dors and the Internet. Soft Reserves 
sells class readers. 

"The last couple of years 
haven't been so good for us," said 
Soft Reserves Manager Jennifer 
Mancano. "Thanks to the evil 
Internet, lots of professors are now 
doing things online." 

Soft Reserves has also made 
changes to halt profit losses. 

"We have cut back on our stu-
dent staff, we're ordering fewer 
materials, increa ing advertisement 
to professors - we're trying lots of 
different things," Mancano said. 

The success of Soft Reserves 
and other enterprises partly deter-
mines funding for A.S. services 
such as Student-Run Television. If 
business profits contin ue to drop, 
new sources of funding may be 
necessary for student services. 

The A.S. enterprise office 
is working on a task force that

would merge Soft Reserves and A.S. 
Lecture Notes in order to provide a 
more efficient service, according to 
A.S. Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Angela Chen. 

"Our main focus this past year 
and for next year is just to gener-
ate profitability, because we haven't 
been bringing in the neces ary rev-
enue," she stated in an e-mail. 

Despite profit concerns, A.S. 
enterprises provide a unique learn-
ing opportunity for students inter-
ested in business, Mancano said. 

However, it is unclear whether 
UCSD can main!llin viable student-
run businesses. 

"1 think that a business run by 
lazy students is doomed to fail , 
but one run by energetic students 
is bound to produce some of the 
most successful businesse> ever 
seen," Cogan said. "JUSt think of 
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. We've 
got some of that kind of !lllent at 
UCSD."

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the University of California at San Diego. 
Contents ~ 2005. Views expressed herein represent the majority vote of the editOrial board 

and are not necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents. the ASUCSD or the members 01 the 
Guardian staff. 

Students cheated over 
2001 A.S.P. referendum 
n 2001, AS. council members 
asked srudents to increase 
their own fees by nearly 
$60,000 each year to pay for 
the Academic Success pro-
gram, which provides men-
taring and book rental for 
low-income students. And 
srudents agreed. 

Now, four years later, 
AS.P. has seen only a frac-
tion of the money, and a large 
portion has been co-opted by 
the council to p ay for other 
things, like college festivals. 
Last year, senators voted to 
give the program $42,000 

diverting the remaining 
20,000 for other purposes. 

However, AS.P. didn't even 
spend that amount, with as 
much as $4,000 left over at 
the end of this year, according 
to A.S.P. Executive Director 
Terry Le. . 

The students, who thought 
they were voluntarily helptng 
a worthy cause, must receive 
an explanation. The AS. 
financIal controller shoul.d 
carry out an immediate and 

transparent audit, showing 
what almost a quarter of a 
million dollars since 2001 
has been spent on. For its 
part, the A.S. Council must 
oemand accountability by 
requiring AS.P' to submit a 
line-item spending plan each 
spring, pnor to the annual 
budget allocations. 

Students de erve no less: 
They should reject any new 
referenda that do not include 
a detailed spendin,g plan, 
unless they are marketed as 
general fees increase. 

Clearly, somethincr has 
gone wrong. The brea~down 
could be in leadership, with 
the AS.P' executive director 
failing to expand the pro-
gram as students asked. Or 
the problem could be with 
the referendum process itself, 
in which students vote on 
ill-conceived and ill-planned 
measures. 

Either way, students 
deserve an explanation before 
agreein g to vote on any new 
fee increase. 

Morris has the best 
idea for A.S. stipends 

ven as the A.S. Council 
scrambles to find any sem-
blance of money to give back 
to srudents, the issue of its 
own stipends remains a con-
te ted issue. 

Currently, stipends are 
tiered between president, 
vice presidents and commis-
sioners. Thurgood Marshall 
Colleg-e Junior Senator Jason 
Hoski ns proposed during a 
budget meetmg to vary sti-
pend amounts among AS. 
executive officers according 
to the amount of work put 
into respective positions. 
This faulty plan was rightly 
voted down. The time spent 
by each officer in a posi-
tion is ambiguous and vari-
able, and would open doors 
to never-ending debate over 
which commissioner or vice 
president deserves a larger 
stipend. 

Some senators argued that 
staggered stipends would 
represent a step toward a self-
sufficient council by shaping 
the governing body after a 
business mooe!. However, 
CillTent stipends for officers 
are too small to truJy reward 

better performance. Until 
stipends become more than a 
symbolic gesture, any attempt 
to create an autonomous, 
businesslike A.S. Council 
would be wishful thinking. 

Commiss io ner of 
Programming Eric Morris 
provided the wisest sugges-
tion during budget talks, ree-
OInmending the substirution 
of individual-stipend hikes 
and cuts for the creation 
of entire office budgets. A 
"spread-the-wealth" mental-
ity would promote higher 
production from whole areas 
of student government with-
out stirring a bees nest of 
individual stipend disputes. 

As for Morris himself, the 
majority of senators agreed 
that the programming com-
missioner's workload is too 
heavy in proportion to the 
position's current compensa-
tion. Creating a vice presi-
dent position for Morris 
alone would bump the com-
missioner of programming 
up into a higher pay category, 
satisfying bOth councilmem-
bers and the programming 
office.

CONSOLIDATING 
Student Loan Debt 
conSOlida~ionJune ' 30 2005 Deadline: r 

ATTENTION Student & Parent Borrowers 
Act now to lock in low interest rates by consolidating 
your student loan debt. Parent PLUS borrowers may 

consolidate their PLUS loan debt. 

Student loan interest rates are expected to rise from approximately 
2.8% to an estimated 4-5% on July 1. 

Consolidating at a fixed interest rate now may 
result in huge savings to you. 

Borrowers who were recently rejected for loan consolidation 
should contact their lenders again. In school borrowers are now 

able to consolidate based upon recent guidance.

pon for the team would help in the 
upcoming years. 

uThe crowd energizes the team, 
and gives a real home-court advan-

in RlMAC would definitely create 
more energy and buzz. ~

uEveryone tried to change their 
games to work together, ~ Carr said. 
"In the future, we will recruit to the 
style of play.~ 

On the subject of recruiting, and 
on whether he felt that UCSD was 
at a distinct competitive or recruit-
ing disadvantage as the only non-
scholarship Division II university, 
Carr pushed aside any excuses. 

UIn a perfe<.'t world, everyone on 
the team would be able to score 20 
points a game, ~ Carr said. UIf they 
don't have to do that and still, in 
their minds, are able to help, we'll be 
better for it. ~ 

The improvement that the team 
showed was what Carr remembers 
most. 

"All season, this team Ic:ept get-
ting better," he said. "The team 
started to believe. They believed in 
what they were doing, they believed 
in each other and they believed they 
could win." 

Carr exudes an unwavering con-
fidence in how well this ream can do 
and how fiar it can go sooner rather 
than later. 

"In building on the Balc:ersfield 
win" - a 66-60 upset over Cal State 
Bakersfield - "and other games 
like the Bakersfield win, we'll JUSt 
continue improving, [andJ can win 
immediately," Carr said.

"It's not as big of a disadvantage 

as some people make it seem," he 
said. uThere are [soJ many positive 
reasons to come play for this team 
that we don't have to worry [aboutJ 
what we don't have." 

During the season, no player 
averaged double digits in scoring, 
with freshman Clint Allard notching 
a team-leading 9.4 points per game. 
Nor did any player dominate in 
playing time, with freshman Andrew 
Hatch averaging the most per game 
at 29.3 minutes. 

So, how far can this team go' 
Since joining Division II, the Tritons 
have not had a .500 season, and yet, 
Carr says emphatically that the goal 
is not to simply reach that plateau, 
but to win the conference. 

"Otherwise, why play?" he said.

Carr feels that his team serves as 
"great representatives for the stu-

Carr does not want last year's 
Bakersfield victory to remain the 
biggest win in UCSO's Di\~sion II 
history. With every player from the 
team who played 10 minutes or more 
per game eligible to return, added 
talent coming from new recruits and 
team chemistry rising as the players 
spend more time together, there is

Tritons advance all the way to Nationals Coach Carr 

works 
wonders in 
first year 

By MICHAEL NEUSTEDTER 
Staff Writer 

After finishing the 2004 season 
last spring without a playoff berth, 
a postseason appearance in 2005 
would have marked a vast improve-
ment for the UCSD men 's lacrosse 
team. Instead, the team not only 
competed in the league playoAs 
this sea on, but also earned a trip 
[0 Minnesota for a chance to cap-
mre the national championship. 

The Tritons' victory over 
C hapman University on Feb. 12 
made appa rent that the team was 
not the same squad that opposing 
te:II11S had seen in years pa t. The 
PaIHhers had beaten U SD in 
c'lch of the last three season. 

"Beating Chapman at the 
begi nning of the season was huge 
for us," sophomore P.J. Masterson 
said. "We knew that we had a very 
specia l team." 

As the season progressed, the 
Tritons were recognized for team-
work as well as many outstanding 
individual performances. 

Senior Phil mith contributed 
offensively to the "fi iton ' scor-
ing attack as a rnidfiddcr. Smith 
maintained his presen.:e on the 
field even though his goal total 
decrca ed compared to last sea-
son. 

"Phil is clearly the most vocal 
leader on the team because every-
one listens to him," Masterson 
said. "His impact cannot be mea-
su red by sta tis tics. " 

Head couch Jon Hughes echoed 
Ma terson' comments. 

"Phil decided this season [0 
sacri fiee his goals for teamwork," 
Hughes said. "He shifted his con-
centration from coring to leader-
hip." 

Freshman Dave Piccina ti 
also impressed many players and 

coaches with a differem role than 
the one that was expected of him. 
Piccinati went into the season as 
the back-up goaltender, but even-
tually took over the tarting posi-
tion during the regular season. 

"He surprised everybody on 
the team," Masterson said. "He 
really earned hi way to the start-
ing position." 

Piccinati was not the only 
rookie to have a huge impact 
on the team's successful season. 
Freshman midfielder Eric Price 
was ranked in the top 10 for scor-
ing in the Western Collegiate 
Laeros e League and was a valu-
able offensi ve 355et for UCSD. 

"The rookies definitely did a 
great Job for us on the field," 
tlughes said . "Their comributions 
cannot be overlooked." 

o one on the team had a 
grea ter impact than junior attack-
man Nick Dean, however. Dean 
was not only the top scorer for the 
team, but also for the league. 

"If Nick was not specifically 
guarded, we would have blown the 
team out," Masterson said. "He 
always gives us a chance to win ." 

Dean W ;IS also presented wi th 
first team all -league honor as the 
WCLL's Offensive Player of the 
Year, and as the UCSD sports 
club Male Athlete of the Year. He 
received the UCSD award for the 
second straight year. The award 
has been given to a member of 
the lacrosse team for three years 
in a row. 

"Personal recognition is great;" 
Dean said. "But you also have to 
remember that the awards reflect 
the help of my teammates." 

Hughes also stressed the 
importance of Dean's exceptional 
play on the field. 

"He makes everyone out there 
much better," Hughes said. "Nick's

in the national championship aher missing the playoffs altogether in 2003{)4. 
play on the field reminds me a lot 
like the way Barry Bonds can read 
a pitch before it even leaves the 
pitcher's hand because of the fact 
that he can sense what will happen 
before it actually does." 

Dean 's performance has been 
noticed throughout the country. 
He is often recognized by the 
lacrosse world as one of the top 
three attackmen in the United 
States. 

"Nick is notonlya big, tall [and] 
outstanding athlete, but he is also 
well-conditioned," Hughes said. 
"This combination has allowed 
him to be one of the best players I 
have ever coached in my 12 years 
at the collegiate level." 

Mter only losing three games 
during the regular season and being 
ranked as the eighth-best team in 
the nation, the Tritons earned a 
spot in the league pla~·offs . They 
were able to beat Chapman for the 

second time of the season in order 
to earn a spot in the final four in 
Berkeley. 

However, the Tritons were 
beaten by Sonoma State, which 
eventually lost to UC Santa 
Barbara in the championship, but 
fini hed second at Nationals. 

Following its excellent season, 
the team was awarded a trip to 
the national championship tourna-
ment in Blaine, Minn. 

"It was great to go from a non-
playoff team one season to a team 
with a chance to win a national 
championship," Dean said. "We 
owe a great deal of our success to 
the coaching staff." 

In addition to Hughes, the team 
was guided with help from coaches 
Mike Dewan and AJbert Man. 

Ross Stensrud, a former player, 
was also on the sidelines coaching

In head coach Bill Carr's first ca-
son with the UCSD men 's basket-
ball team, he guided the Tritons to 
new Division fl marks, with II wins 
and the teams first winning home 
record since it moved into the divi-
sion. What is he playing for his sec-
ond se;lson in San Diego? Winning 
the California Collegiate Atllietic 
Association, the premier conference

Carr admitted that upon first 
being hired by UCSD, he didn't have 
any real expectations, not knowing 
enough to develop any. 

"When I gOt in, I thought we 
had a chance to win some games," 
Carr said. 

Looking back on the season and 
how the team members did, Carr 
said that he was "satisfied by the 
effort that they gave," adding that 
"for 90 percent of the season, this 
team overachieved." 

\¥lth the arrival of a new coach 
came the arrival of a new offensive 
system - one that emphasized less 
dribbling and more ball movement 
and was more tightly strucmred 
than that of recent Triton basketball 
teams. Carr came to a team that

Title IX • remaInS controversial after 33 years of debate 

eyn City ~) 
Cynthia Blade Chavez 

Former UCSD Director of 
Athletics and current NCM Vice 
Presiclent of Championships and 
Education ervices Judy Sweet 
cri ticized the new Title IX legal 
clarifications in her speech at the 
Association of Women in Sports 
,\IIedia Cunvention on May 28 in 
downtown San Diego. 

Title IX is the ninth part of the 
1972 education amendments and 
prohibits discrimination on the basis 
of sex in any educational program 

recei\~ng federal funclin". AJthough 
UCSD docs not provide athletic 
schobrships, the university must 
provide equal oppormniti es for lTIen 
and women to participate in spurts 
and enforce equal treatment in II 
areas, including equipment, sched-
uling. of practices, coaching and 
recnlltment. 

ince its passage, legi sla tors , 
school administra tors , coaches, ath-
letes and tlle media have cha llenged 
Title lX. 

In 1974, CUligress rejected the 
' rower Amendment to Title IX 
introduced by enator John Tower 
(R- Texas). The proposed amen 1-
ment would have exempted all rev-
enue-produci ng athletic pr grams 
from complyi ng with TItle IX. 

In 1979, the Dcp,lrtmcnt of 
Ilcalth, Education and Welfare 
I\sued a three-prong test for instim-
tions to follow in complying with 

Title DC. The following yea r, the 
Office for Civil Rights was created 
by the Department o f Education 
and held responsible for enforcing 
Title DC. 

In 19 8, Congress overrode 
President Ronald Reagan's vetO and 
pa sed the Civil Rights Restoration 
Act of 1987. The act mandates 
that any university receiving fed-
eral funds for one of its programs 
must comply with Title IX in all its 
programs. 

In 1996, OCR issued a clarifica-
tion of tlle three-prong test, allow-
ing instimtions to select any of the 
three independent tests to ensure 
compliance with Title DC. 

In 2002, the National Wrestling 
Coaches Association fil ed a law-
suit, allebring that Title IX's poli-
cies are unconstitutional and are 
causing mens programs [0 be cut. 
U.S. District Court Judge Emmet 

ullivan later dismis ed the lawsuit. 
From 2002 through 2004, four 

Title D( complaints against Fresno 
State were filed witll OCR. 

The Title DC panel discussion 
addressed important issues sur-
rounding tlle federal statute includ-
ing a new interpretation of the 
three-prong test adopted by OCR 
on March I 7. The new clarification 
declared that institutions may u e a 
'Ncb survey as "an acceptable metll -
od to measure smdcnts' interests 
in participating in sports," accord-
ing to OCR. Sweet called this new 
interpremtion a faulty methodology 
because getting no re ponse from 
~tudents surveyed can be interpreted 
as "lack of interest." 

In re ponse to the clarification, 
CM President Myles Brand said 

that this new clarification "will likely 

stymie the growth of women's ath-
letics and could reverse the progress 
made over the last three decades." 

[n addition, Stanford Athletic 
Director Ted Leland made a public 
statement declaring that Stanford 
will not follow OCR's new inter-
pretation. 

Opposition to Title IX is not lim-
ited to legis.lamres. In a 2003 survey 
of sports editors, the panel found 
that 53 percent believe Title IX 
negatively affects men's programs. 

In 2000, former Fresno State 
women's volleyball coach Lindy Vivas 
walked into the athletic department's 
business office to pick up a check, 
only to run into an "Ugly-Woman 
Athlete Day" party held by Scott 
Johnson, an athletic administrator. 
Fresno Smte President Johl1 Welty 
named Johnson as athletics director 
in January 2002, after he had served 
as interim director since July 200 1. 

.ott is my opinion that Dohnson] 
systematically sta rted to get rid of 
tho e that defencled Title IX," Vivas 
said at the panel discussion. 

Johnson did not renew Vivas' 
contract in 2004. She coached the 
women's volleyball team for 14 years 
\vith a 263-167 record, including 
three CM tournament appear-
ances. Ln May 2004, Vivas filed a 
Title IX complaint against Fre no 
State to OCR. Her complaint is one 
of four Title IX complaints aga inst 
the chool filed sin c November 
2002. 

[n May 2005,Johnson armounced 
his retirement from his position as 
Fresno State athletic director and was 
replaced by tllen Ohio Univer ity 
Athletic Director Thomas Boeh. 

Since the pas age of Title IX, 
UCSD Athletics has complied with 

lbe rules and regulations of Title IX: 
Title IX: 

"No person in the United States 
shall, on the basis of sex, be 
excluded from participation in, 
be denied the benefits of or be 
subjected to discrimination under 
any education program or activity 
receiving federal financial assis-
tance~ 

How Title IX applies to Mh-
letic propams: 
An institution must meet all of 
the following requirements in 
order to be in compliance with 
Title IX 

I. For participation require-
ments, institutions' officials must 
meet one of the following three 
tests. An institution may: 

a' Provide partiCipation oppor-
tunities for women and men that 
are substantially proportionate to 
their respective rates of enroll-
ment of full-time undergraduate 
students; 

the regulations wlder tlle leader-
ship of Sweet and current Athletics 
Director Earl W. Edward . 

"Without question, TItle IX has 
had an extremely positive effect for 
women participJting in intercolle-
giate sports," Edwards stated on the 
UCS D Athletics Web site. 

The new CR interpretation of 
part C of the stamte that allows 
institutions to use Web surveys d s 
not presently apply to UC D . 

According to May, UCSD instead 
meets a requirement of part one of 

b) Demonstrate a history and 
continuing practice of program 
expansion for the underrepresent-
ed sex; 

c) Fully and effectively accom-
modate the interests and abili-
ties of the underrepresented sex; 
and, 

2. Female and male student-
athletes must receive athletics 
scholarship dollars proportional to 
their participation; and, 

s. Equal treatment of female 
and male student athletes in the 
11 provisions: equipment and 
supplies; scheduling of games 
and practice times; travel and 
daily allowance/per diem; access 
to tutoring; coaching, locker 
rooms, practice and competitive 
facilities; medical and training 
facilities and services; housing 
and dining facilities and services; 
publicity and promotions; sup-
port services and recruitment of 
student athletes.

mean both the traditional, canvas 
handled bags hippies use in gro-
cery stores and, more generally, the 
big, open bags with handles - not 

chick in your art class who 
doesn't like the Beatles. Oh, 

sigh - it's just the same main-
streamization of indie culture that 
killed Converse. But seeing as it's 
already becoming unacceptably 
trendy to sport even plain black 
slip-on Vans (especially if you're 
ever unlucky enough to find your-
self at the Irvine Spectrum), we 
trend-seuers will have to move on 
to something new. Where can you 
buy Keds, anyway?

A CASE OF GARDEN STATE SYNDROME 

Garden State Syndrome" is what they are going to call it, and it will happen like this: A big summer love movie will get the college market crying to their Live 
Journals, and the accompanying soundtrack - lush with 
nicely coiffed pseudo-indie tracks - will lure them online 
to get smacked with an RIAA lawsuit. (How many of you 
new Iron & Wine/Shins fans went out and bought the 

G soundtrack? That's what I thought.) Who knows 
what it'll be this summer ... but come next fall, a lucky 

group of perfectly-dirties will moan the 
next heartthrob hit, all due to some boring-
ass onscreen love spiel. Get over it, folks : 
"Eternal Sunshine" was waaaaay better, and 
you can find all that music in the Gum-ditm 
('cause we like it too.)

THE DAWNING OF 
A NEW DVD ERA 

Wen Steven Soderbergh announced last April that he was going to release his next six films in the theaters and on DVD on the same day, it 
shocked many industry insiders. But is Soderbergh's 
decision so surprising considering the recent decline in 
box office receipts since the rise of the DVD? Despite 
the latest "Star Wars" phenomena, Variety reports that 
overall box office sales have been down for the last

CORPORATE ROCK STILL ROCKS 

YoU know the story painfully well: You're shopping with a friend during winter break at Amoeba Music for the first time in 1999, and 
you ask the clerk for some Weezer records. The 
douche laughs at you and buzzes you off. Your 
friend, on the other hand, asks for P ~vement's 
Cnxlktd RHin, Crooked Rnill and gets a golden 
road . 

Is now really the first time in the hi story of rock 
music that this cruel double standard has been 
destroyed) Perhap . It is no question that under-
ground favorites such as Modest Mouse, lnterpol 
and the Pixies have simultaneously pleased their 
underground fan bases and mainstream America. 
If these bands had reached their commercial suc-
cess five years ago, they would've been branded as 

traitors by indie fans everywhere. 
Why? Perhaps their music is 

simply too good to ignore.

c1e. Last year, for the first time in a long time, it 
was A-OK to like Britney Spears' "Toxic;" every 
indie prick dug it. In turn, this year, it 's totally 
A-OK to dig Duff, Clarkson and the like. Whar's 
going on? Perhaps it can be best described by 
previous generations; we're rebell ing against their 
elitism. Most of our parents and older siblings 
listened to the popular music of their day. Thi~ 
means we can go home to Led Zeppelin, Hendrix, 
and, if we're bles ed with a hip family, the MeS, 
Velvet Underground, Bl ack Flag or ubotnick 
records. 

These two groups of "hip" and "not- 'u·hip" 
started a cui tural war as soon as rock music was 
turned into a business strategy by the corporate 
world. The groups that sided with major label 
owned the world, and the groups that stayed 
underground remained iconic for the curious few. 
Siding with corporations is very un-rock 'n' roll , 
so major label bands did poorly with serious music 
fans. But this year, the tides have turned. Witll 
downloading the prime source for music, corpo-
rations no longer dictate our tastes. Fans no lon-
ger emphasize the economic status of a band. The 
combination of such an attitude and the rebelling 
against our previous generations of peeing down 
on successful bands has helped indie bands rise to 
success without losing credibility. Lets hope next 
year we see the rise of Wolf Eyes.

MEAL TICKET TO 
THE MAINSTREAM 

Last year, P. Diddy was the launch pad for all new artists trying to make it big. Now, everybody who's anybody knows that "The O.c." is the surest way to stardom ' year. However, DVD sales and rentals have become one of the industry's biggest money-makers, and movies that go "straight to 
DVO" aren't so bad anymore. DVO sales have been the saving grace of 
films such as "The Bourne Identity," which had less-thall-stellar box office 
results. But does Soderbergh's decision indicate that the DVO will replace 
multiplexes around the country? Hopefully not, because going out to the 
movies is one of the few great American rituals. However, it is hard to 
beat the convenience and cost of recent DVD advents such as Netflix and 
Blockbuster Online. 

in the music business. Puffy who? Case(s) in point - the Killers, KClIne, 
Phantom Planet, Modest Mouse, the Walkmen. Adequate amount of musical 
talent, some pop appeal, but the big mother-ship VIP pass to everybody's ste-
reos is the luck of being featured on the "The O.c." soundtrack. Yeah you've 
got Mischa Banon and her perfect hair, plus lots of plot twists in the mighty 
adventurous California town, but "The O.c." does nothing better than exist 

Maybe the rise of the DVD is due to the f.Ict that many Americans are tOO 
lazy to get up from the couch to go to the movies, or maybe it's because we 
don't want to pay $10 and sit through an hour of previews, just to watch Vin 
Diesel playa nanny. In any case, lets hope Soderbergh's next project is worth 
watching, either in the theaters or on DVD.

as the biggest portal to promoting "the next big thing" and major comebacks 
(think Beck). What's better is that this indie talent hothouse launched not one 
release but four. That~ right, four big fat soundtracks housing opportunities 
for artists that would otherwise go unseen on M1V radar screens. Got a band 
in your garage, some dreams of becoming a rock star and not enough cash to 
do it? "The O.c." is open-armed and waiting for you.

Common 
Be 

Geffen 

***, 

Common has always been an MC able to unite the "backpack rap" crowd 
with the grimy, hip-hop pur-
ists. This reputation as being 
somewhat of a rapper's rap-
per has led many, including 
Common himself, to believe 
that he is one of the crucial 
pieces of the hip-hop puzzle, 
potentially elevating the con-
scious rapper mentality to the 
mainstream. 

Common seems to see this 
prospect as a burden. He even 
goes so far as to compare his 
"sacrifice" to that of Christ 
These spots of self-righteous-
ness, while noteworthy, aren't 

overwhelming, and do not 
detract significantly from the 
overall quality of the album. 

Nine of the II tracks are 
produced by Kanye West, cre-
ating an appropriately soulful 
background for Common's 
inspired lyrics. While West's 
production is always strong, 
he is dead weight as an MC, 
forcing Common to work 
overti me on the four songs on 
which he appears to compen-
sate. Common's lyrical abil-
ity is as versatile from similes 
to storytelling as in previous 
albums, although not quite as 
creative or original. 

It is too early to tell 
whether this album will bring 
together the two halves of 
hip-hop and bring the game 
to a higher level, both musi-
cally and intellectually. The 
inherent contradiction to 
his mission - bringing con-
sciousness to the mainstream 
while striving to keep this 
higher level of consciousness 
esoteric - is the main prob-
lem with this album, but Be is 
a big step toward taking hip-
hop out of the clubs and back 
to the streets. 

Common will perform at 
House of Blues on June 8.

Of Montreal 
The Sunlandic Twins 

Polyvinyl 

**** O 0 you adore the Flaming Lips but think that they don't 
sound enough like Queen? 
Fear not. Of Montreal can 
service your needs - for 
the seventh time. The 
April release of the one-
man-band's newest studio 
album, Tht Sunla7ldic Twins, 
embarks upon another 
magical headphone adven-
ture, sailing the seas of 
indie-pop. This time 
around, the feel is more 
electronic, with throbbing 
beats and snipped-up delay 
loops tickling the far limits 
of perception, all under a 

warm blanket of twee-psy-
chedelic folk smudged with 
the buzzing lo-fi curiosity 
of indie nobility Neutral 
Milk Hotel. 

About half of the tracks 
rely on synth bass and 
fidgety E-drums, building 
layers of guitars, strings, 
vocals and other precious 
music box sounds atop 
them. The voices swoop 
and blend theatrically, like 
early Freddie Mercury 
with LSD in his Lucky 
Charms. Of Montreal is 
the permanent vehicle of 
one Kevin Barnes, and his 
singulaf creativity yields 
such lyrical gems as: "The 
language of the frost lobs 
dead balloons over ruins 
today / In view of wan 
wordless crowds that chase 
waifs to spires with fiery 
plumes" (from the album's 
best song, .. Forecast

Sleater-Kinney 
The Woods 

Sub Pop 

**** Usually when critics praise a band's matu-rity, it's a signal for 
the music fan that the 
music has gone to shit. 
For example, the critical 
acclaim of Red Hot Chili 
Peppers' recent works 
Clllifornicatio71 and By the 
Way was another way of 
saying that the band need-
ed to go back to shooting 
dope. 

Sleater-Kinney are 
the exception to the 
rule. The Woods finds 
the band matured with 
a sophistication that its 
riot grrri counterparts 

never reached. Their 
classic, raw sound still 
roars, however, and will 
undoubtedly piss off local 
Republi cans. But Sleater-
Kinney are more than 
a pissing contest; their 
sound is refined to a level 
that few bands can accom-
plish. Shoot, how many 
bands can you count that 
pis off Republi cans' 

Too many, no doubt. 
Sleater-Kinney have 
instead found on Woods 
the common ground 
between raucous rockin' 
and experimental snob-
bin'. Songs such as "The 
Fox," "The Wilderness" 
and "Modern Girl" arc 
staples of solid rocking. 
On the other end of the 
spectrum, the songs "Let's 
Call It Love" and "Night 
Light" are glorious exper-
imental adventures into 
the realm of improv rock. 
This stelJar combination 
of rock straightforward-
ness with experimental 
zest will surely please a 
diverse crowd, thus mak-
ing The Woods easily one 
of the best releases in 
2005 .

When people are asked to describe the hip-hop sound, most will describe either the 
thumping, Southern Lil' Jon style, 
or they will point to the sped-up 
soul sample. This sound, jacked from 
Ghostface and popularized by Kanye 
West, sounds kind of like Alvin and 
the Chipmunks after the sample is 
sped-up from the S\ving of '60s soul 
to match the faster tempo of hip-hop. 
This sort of chipmunk hook is not 
exclusive to Kanye, as Beanie Sigel. 
the Diplomats and many other East 
Coast acts use this device as a way of 
not having to write a chorus of their 
own. "The East i n't the only side 
of the map relying on the original -
ity of 40 years ago to craft a hit, and 
soul-sampling is lowly creeping into 
Southern and Bay Area rap, softening 
the hard corners of crunk and hyphy, 
respectively. 

Due in large part to the fast-paced editing seen on Tv, America 's attention span now rests some-
where between five and 10 seconds. 
What better way to capitalize on this 
than with the no talgic cli p show, 
helpfully reminding us of shit tharjrot 
happened. VHI loves the '70s, '80s, 
and '90s, and now they also love Last 
Week, because how else wiU you find 
out who Paris Hilton is screwing or 
whos winning the epic Duff-Lohan 
feud ' It is critical that we intimately 
know celebrities with whom we will 
never come into contact, and impor-
tant to learn this material from com-
mercial actors and unsuccessful come-
dians. Vicarious living isn't the only 
option though, as pop culture is now 
also fascinated with the dignity-lack-
ing "regular" people willing to appear 
on reality shows. Miss anything? Fear 
not - somewhere in the diarrhea of 
reality television highlights, the rel-
evant three seconds will be shown.

Clayton Worfolk - Editor in Chief 
One of these days I'm gonna get organizized." I came acros this phrase 
by way of the Clash circa 2000, 18-
some years after they appropriated it 
for ermlbat Rock and almost 25 years 
after Robert De iro immortal-
ized it in "Taxi Driver." It's what 
communication scholars C.lll "reme-
diation" - the repre entation of one 
medium by another - though this 
was urterh' lost on me at the time. 
All r wondered was what the hell Joe 

trummer had gotten out of "Taxi 
Driver" that I had yet ro, and why 
he had begtm to emu late De iro's 
character (in ' hairstyle and eyewear. 
at least) following the release of 
what was to be the band's la t proper 
album. 

My fascination with the pow-
erful, wonderful and de picable 
world of media did not begin here, 
bUl it could well have. Music and 
film have commanded my atten-
tion throughout college, distnlcting 
me incessantly but also exemplifYing 
the heady notions of representa-
tion expounded in my cOllUTIunica-
tion studies and the more practical 
questions of why media - however 
corporately controlled, hopele sly 
biased (though not in ti,e way idi-
ots like Ken ' Iomlinson think) or 
inherentlv undcmocratic - matters. 
This is ~hat come to mind when I 
tllink about mv rime at the Grurrdiall.

ing year as editor in chief, I couldn't 
be happier \\itll our newspaper - or 
joumali 'm, in general.

\ \ 'hlch I ~n't a bad thmg whcn our 
fiwori tc division of Student ffairs 

handles its shit, but which sucks roy-
ally when page counts Start dropping 
as a result of mislTIwaged budgets, 
revenue ho rtfalls and other bureau-
cratic snags that tend to befall non-
student-run enterprises. 

et, in o ur editors' sea rch for 
structural remedies to this crisis, 
I'm happy to say th e Guardian 
has undergone a very self-con-
sciou transformation. After look-
ing closely at a numher of other 
student-run newspapers, we now 
recognize how lucll' we are to 
boast that we have no adviser, for 
example. We realize how fortu-
nate we are to have the opportu-
nity to rise in the paper's editorial 
ranks without the approva l of a 
university department head. vVe 
understand that we are privileged 
to be able to run the newspaper's 
newly forn ed and student-oper-
ated Business Oversight Board, 
wh ich explicitly ties the business 
office's financial functions to the 
Guardian's mi ion - to best serve 
the university cOlTImunity and best 
provide experience for students in 
all facets of journ alism. 

Best of aU, though, we now know 
where we stand. IdentifYing our 
institutional independence has been 
pretty damn empowering; acting in 
our operation's best interest - even 
if, ay, we discover that our univer-
sity thinks it has more of a hand in 
sajd operation's management than 
governing documents state - may 
be even more so. 

10 the 2004-05 executive board, 
who bavt identified exactly what they 
want this papq to be and how they 
want to get it there: It would've been 
unreasonable to ask previous staffs 
(0 convene for emergency meerinb'5 
and the like. ot y'aLi. 

To Grant, who has already begun 
putting my leadership to shame (in 
the good way): You 've picked a damn 
fun year to be Ele. Don't let the 

frustrations of the job get you down. 
Great things are in store for the 
Guardian. 

To Mather, whose ability to bal-
ance the Gllard with the occasional 
film festival amazes me: Sorry for 
my forgetfulness and for the soror-
ity jokes. J hope our work relation-
ship didn 't se t back our friend-
ship too badly; remember th e beer 
pong. 

To the force of nature that is 
Vladimir Kogan: You arc no less 
than the greatest thing that's hap-
pened (0 the Gl.l.nrdian in my rime. 
Trust that we all appreciate it, and 
please consider another year after 
next. 10 Mariarme: Thanks for 
bringing Opinion furthcr into the 
Light; it's looking better and bet-
ter. To Matt: Much grari1;Ude for 
keeping the fridge stocked and the 
Swishers rolled. To Blade: Pota will 
miss you much, Cabengo. To Hans: 
Thanks for stepping up to the plate; 
I'll po' your Chandon any day. To 
Ian: I'll be asking for a job at your 
magazine somewhere down the line, 
so don 't forget who hired you. To 
Travis: Thanks for bringing a little 
professionalism to this office. To 
Andrew: Putting shit on page is as 
thankless as it gets, but your influ-
ence has been marked this year. To 

athan and I-leather: Scratch that; 
copy is /:rilly thankless, but l'Udos for 
making everyone's lives easier and 
their stories better. 

To the business folk, without 
whom the Guardian would cease to 
function: Lori, your truSt in us is 
much valued; Adrienne, your dedi-
cation to the paper and help in those 
initi.al stages (attending 8 p.m. staff 
meetings, ahem) \Va criticdl; oelle, 
your ability to integrate back into a 
very different Guardian til an the one 
you left has been appreciated; Mike 
and Michael, your commionent to 
the paper over the years is what 
makes it possible for me to be writ-

ing this right now. 
And to Emilee: "lmproved rela-

11lURSDAY, JUNE 2. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SENIOR SENOOFF BII 



B 12 SENIOR SENroOFF THE U . 0 GUARDIAN 

Sarah Mak - Associate Hiatus Editor 

I t was on a cold, wi ndy and extremely wet day in Lo nd on las t ummer wh en I fin a lly 
rea lized how much San Diego 
meant to me - after pend ing 
most of my fres hman and sopho-
lIlore yea r refusi ng to call San 
Diego my home, I was actually 
homesick for the place. And it 
wasn't just the sun and the beach I 
missed; it was everything. 

My four years at UCSD have 
gone by far too quickly for my lik-
ing. Knowing I would have to say 
bye to everything that's fam iliar, I 
entered senior year with a plan : to 
live in denial - den ial about th e 
end of my undergradua te career 
and sayi ng goodbye to those clos-
est to me. Of course, my pla n 
di dn 't go quite as planned , and 
as I write this I only have a few 
more days left at UCSD. I've had 
an incrc'dible four yea rs here, so 
you can unde rsta nd why writing 
this is so hard fo r me; 900 words 
is not goi n!l' to do my experie nce 
here jus ti ce. But that 's all I have , 
so here goes - pardon the sappy 
factor ... 

fter a brief summer stin t at 
a local magazine in H ong Kong, 
I decided two things: I ) I needed 
to get a job desperately; 2) Doing 
someth ing you love, like writing , 
fo r a living wasn't that shabby an 
idea. If Carrie Bradshaw could 
make it look so glamorous, r fi g-
ured, why nO! give it a try. So I 
dec ided to see what this whole 
"Guflrdifl n thing" was all about. 
Earl ie r, I use the te rm "living" 
loosely as th ere is no way in hell 
that r could actuall y have lived 
off my GUfl1'difl11 wages alone. But 
that's the thing: Despite the fact 
that th e Vi etnam vets on the corne r 
by th e Mobi l station made more 
money than 1 did per hour, T sti ll 

did it. " 'hy, you ask? T he answer 
is , impl e: D espite the la te- nigh t 
Tuesday producti ons and incessant 
grumbling and moaning to my 
roommate, I realized that what was 
"work" wasn 't reall y work. Work 
mea nt spendin g a day with some of 
UC D's mo t arti culate and dedi-
ca ted people. It's one thing to pick 
up the Gllllrdifl l1 and read it every 
Mond ay and T hursday, bur once 
you're involved in the production 
of it, you see it in a different light 
and appreciate the pa per a lot 
more. T he people I work with are 
not onl y some of the most brilliant 
and intell igent people I know here, 
but they are also some of the most 
committed, and for that r have 
nothing bur the utmost respect for 
them. r spent my fi rst two years 
at U C SD wande ring arou nd aim-
lessly (somethi ng, I've learned , I'm 
quite good at, and something I'm 
sure I will be doing a lot in the 
next year), and had I not decided 
to join the GI/(lrdlfl1l my junior 
year, leaving UCS D wo uld be a 
lot easie r. 

Of course, no G llfI7'di(l1/ seni or 
endoff wo uld be complete without 

a brief menti on o f the Gllm'dlfl l/ 'S 
annual Vegas trip. T here's no thing 
quite like spending six hours hot-
boxing a car, arriving at the garish, 
dazzling city and the neve r- end -
ing cha-ching of slot machines 
to see your coll eagues indulge in 
debauchery. 

So what am I going to miss' 
Sure, I'll miss th e 75-cent (for-
merl y 50-cent) bage ls, S unday 
brunch , Iliatus co ffee breaks at 
the M andeville cart (arguably the 
best co ffee on campus) and walking 
home and catching a g limpse of the 
sun setting over the Paci fic, but it's 
rea lly the people and frie nds I've 
made here that I'll m iss the most. 

To my Hi atus babies: lan , Illy

but everythmg from my physical 
relocation to Suuthern Califo rn ia 
to the at:adclllic dete rmination 
required of me to Illanlre into a 
(qUJ,I -) re~ponsible adu lt was in i-
tiated I'll' the confident advice of 
Bren St;)ric and I lorace Smith -
a duo better known as "Storace," 
because th ey are do er to each 
other than conjoined twi ns. 

Storace left high school a year 
before me, both coming to La 
j o lla to start college. My fu ture 
at the time was vague at be t, 
but it was clear that fl oundering 
grades and a disinterest in the 
co llege application process left me 
behi nd the curve. In N ovember 
1999, while visiting home, both 
suggested that I look into the pos-
sibil ity of transferri ng to UCS D 
after a couple of years e.lsewhere. 
T he idea stuck, and by August of 
2000, el ewhere was an Orange 
County junior co ll ege. 

The plan was for me to get my 
act together so that I could switch 
over to UC D by the fall of 2002 
so the three of us would have a 
sweet place together, and invar i-
ably fo rget about school amid our 
extracurricular activities. 

T hc one- hour drive separa ted 
us more frequently than I would 
have expected . In some ways, I 
remember wa nting to uphold 
my friendship with them, but 
to simultaneous ly keep it id le in 
order to starve mysel f of thei r 
friendship and of Sa n D iego to 
take my goal eriously so I would 
enjoy the reward in the end . 

Later that fa ll , Brett was diag-
nosed with leukemia while he 
was horne visi ting his family. He 
fought valiantly for a year a half, 

but succum bed on J une 3, 2002. 
After lea rn ing of his condition, 
Brett moved home for trea tment, 
while H orace stayed in San Diego 
for a while before ultimately leav-
ing too. 

When I got here that fall , I 
remem ber sitting in my room one 
evening and contemplating my 
position: T his was an achievement 
that would have been impossible 
if not for the unfaltering support 
o f Storace, despite that neither 
of them were present. The goal 
was achieved, but the reward was 
changed. Since then, though I 

Gfeg Dale/Guardian 
don't believe 1 have ever verbal-
ized it this way, I have considered 
th is a shared experience - one 
that Storace started so I could 
finish it. 

Thank you Brett and Horace; 
thi s is as much your accomplish-
ment as it is mine. Thank you 
Mom, Dad, Gabe, Christine and 
Allegra. Your constant support has 
spoiled me to no end. Margaret, 
thank you for putting up with me

Anna MacMurdo -
Associate Photo Editor 

Almost four years ag~, after studyi ng the wonderfully-detailed UCSD map, r made 
my way to the second floor of the 
Snldent Center, found the door 
marked UCSD GUflrdiflll , and as r 
entered, by chance, ran smack into 
the Lyon, then the photo editor. 
With two years on my high schools 
paper under my belt, 1 hoped that I 
could ta lk my way into continuing 
my photojournalism career as part of 
the GIIB/'dian staff. Lucky for me, he 
liked my photographs. 

Over the next four years, r had the 
pleasure of capturing on film events 
including the crowd-shocking, wheat 
grass-puking contestant on MTV's 
"I Bet You Will ," the Koala's goat-
toting invasion of the A.S. Council 
meeting at watergun-point, and the 
wild, drunken debauchery of several 
Sun God festivals (the one day a year 
that UCSD students act like real 
college students, complete with the 
token streaker). And although not 
every assignment contained vomit 
or mayhem, I enjoyed every moment 
spent behind my camera. 

Photography, to me, has always 
been about capturing the moment, 
and I have always found the fast-

paced world of sports to be the 
biggest challenge in capnu'ing th at 
perfect slice of history. Fractions o f 
seconds are all that there arc between 
the image (,f the swea t-laden player 
mid-silent scream, jumping over the 
wa ll of opposition to gracefully place 
the ball into the circlet of the nct, 
and the frame containi ng a residual 
ann and a ball hangi ng in empty ai r. 
Perhap it was this challenge - or 
simply the fact that I was allowed 
closer than anyone elsc not part of 
the game - that drew me to sportS 
photography, bur over the years, I 
caught o n film all the baskets, goals, 
spikes, home nms, hurdle jumps and 
even frisbee c:ttches that passed in 
front of my lens. 

Even now r don't think it has 
quite hit me yet how much I am 
going to miss the assignments, even 
the last-minute phone calls for pho-
tos of various alcoholic mixers or 
election posters. In fact it prob-
ably won't be until basketball season 
begins in the winter that I will truly 
realize how much I will miss being 
part of this publication. 

And as my hunt to find that per-

Lisa Mak 
Associate News Editor 

E De Woods: This is what I need to become to be serious I Old lady at salon: What> 
Practically deformed ' 

Ene: 0, a law student. 
No, my favori te color isn 't pink, 

I'mnota sorori ty gi rl and I don't have 
a dog named Bnriser (in fac t, the dog 
in the photo isn't even mi ne). And 
I'Ill 'ure as hell not going to H arvard 
Law School. But I am going to law 
school come fall , and I'm about as 
excited as any legally not-blonde-at-
all girl could be. 

Graduating a year ea rly does 
make me a little sad, ince college 
is a great time to bum arowld and 
escape responsibilities. Yet in ret-
rospect, I feel completely satisfied 
with my college experiences during 
the past three years. I accomplished 
everything that I wanted to, par-
tied my ass off, studied abroad and 
joined worthwhile organizations. I'll 
even be able to legally buy alcohol, 
which is daunting, but I wouldn 't 
have it any other way. 

Along the way, I learned a few 
important lessons. First, UCSD is 
not in any way "the boring school. " 
We may not have a Westwood or a 
party block or crazy bums haggling 
us for change, but the campus still 
has a lot to offer. 

Join one or sev=JI of the hundreds 
of student groups and organizations. 
Party it up at house panies or even 
across the border. Take a walk during 
the day in gorgeous downtown La 
Jolla. Make a visit to the beach, where 
you can S\vim, study, surf or just stan 
a bonfire to bum books from MMW/ 
DOC/whatever class you hated most. 
And if you need a change of scenery, 
study abroad for a year. Simply pur, if 
you're not having an awesome time in 
college, its your own damn fault. 

Second , life, during and beyond 
coll ege, will always present a eries 
of chall enges. T he trick isn't to avoid 
these challenges, but to fuel them 
into something worthwhile or, at 
the very lea t, to avoid letting them 
divert you from what you really 
want. Relationship problems, fam-
ily issues, the death of a friend or 
relati ve - J've been through them 
and a lot of you out there have or 
will face them as well. Yet adversity 
can be an advantage in some cases, 
and shouldn't serve as an excuse for 
everything else that might suck in 
your life. 

And fi nall y, I'd li ke to pas on an 
easy "formula fo r success" for my 
friends who sti ll have some time left 
at this university - find out what 

you're good at and what you enjoy, 
and work hard at both. Also, a few of 
your favorite "beverages" now and 
then couldn 't hurt either. 

O f course, no journey wOI~d be 
complete or meaningful without the 
people to share it wi th. So here are 
my personal words of thanks, in no 
particular order: 

T he GIIOt'dian staff: Ah , the group 
that consumed a good portion of 
my college years. I'll remember you 
quirky kids, along with the many 
production days, the hilarious quote 
wall and our crazy times in Vegas. 
Thanks for the lessons in journalism, 
poli tics, booze and good music. 

T he folks from FBLA-PBL: 
Props for a great first year I I had 
a blast working with you all , and 
I know you'll take the chapter to 
even greater heights in the upcom-
ing years. 

The folks from HKSA: I'm glad 
we stuck together and splurged the 
club's money. Hope you guys do the 
same next year. 

The Mira Mesa "family" : Lauren 
and his "crew," Nancy, Amy and 
Ricko - you guys all rock I Thanks 
for the good food, good booze and 
even better memories. I can't imag-
ine wanting to live anywhere else 
during college. 

The 2004 MlSH crew: Thanks 
for being the best study-abroad 
group one could ever wish for. I'U 
always remember those drunken 
karaoke nigh ts, jam-packed train 
rides, supermarket runs, getting lost 
while sightseeing and walking home 
from school. Arigatou! 

1'0 the gi rls from Fra nkfurter 
Hall from freshm an year: You gal 
made my fi rst year here absolutely 
awesome. I know we've all gone 
our separate ways since then, but I 
still remember our late- night Earl s 
runs, our "America n fdol " and 
"Smallvi ll e" addictions, our "sntdy-
ing" in the lounge and ttr magncLic 
ability to attract drama. 

1'0 Britt: After ninc yea rs, we' ll 
fi nally be at different schools. Don't 
miss me too mucht 

To Bryan: r feci like the luckiest 
girl to ha ve you in my life. Love you' 

I f I've forgo tten m yonc, its onl y 
because you were too special to lump 
into onc of the spccific groups men-
tioned above, but I sti ll thank you. 
And since I'm ntfUting Out of space 
and words, I'll simply end here and 
bid fa rewell to m )' college years. 
Now out of my way, have to ge t a 
manicure, a haircut and a fluffy pink 
pen before going to law school.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SENIOR SEN DOFF BI 1 

I Travis Ball - Photo Editor 
Let me start this by saying that being the photo editor for the paper, and not a writer 
by nature, I'm not exactly sure what 
these sen doffs are all about, so bear 
wi th me. When 1 quit my job in 
September to become a full -time 
student aga in, I don't thi nk I knew 
what I was getting myself into. r 
knew r was interested in making my 
time five years prior at jun ior col -
lege worth something and finally 
getting my degree, but I also knew 
1 only had a year to get involved . 
Three very di fferent ac tivi ties took 
up the majori ty of my time this year 
and I'd like to briefly address each. 

The GIID I·dian. Being the photo 
editor and rlli1fu ng a sta ff has cer-
tainly been an interesting experi -
ence. r was able to come in with 
how I thought the photo depart-
ment should be run and make what 
changes r deemed necessary. The 
switch from analog to digi tal went 
more or less smoothly, and the sys-
tem that is now in place will hope-
fully live on and evolve into some-
thing streamlined and efficient. To 
the editors, thanks for putting up 
with my scheduling issues and my 
crazy ideas and rants when 1 was 
able to make the meetings. Anna, 
thanks for all the hard work you've 
put in this year and covering me 
when I wasn't able to make it. 
Andrew, Greg, Billy, Kaia, Jessica, 
Johnny and Jason, thanks for stick-
ing it through to the end. I hope 
you all enjoyed yourselves and 1 
thank you for being ca pable and 
dependable photographers. 

Muir Movie. For those of you 
who have no idea what this is, head 
to Hal f Dome Lounge at the Muir 
campus next year on Mo ndays at 9 
p.l11. (or check out brrp:llwunv. ll1llil·-
rIIllfJie.rom ). T his all -campus organi-
zations sole purpose is to create a 
40-minute film over the course of 
lhe year. Let me tell you, it's a blast. 
You get to t.1ke parr in lhe maki ng 
of a feature fi lm - and who doesn'l 
want to do that? T his year r was tile 
producer for " Five the I lard Way," 
and it was no mi nor un dcrtaking. 
Matt and j anice, )'ou guys were 
ama7.ing and put in more work 
than r would have th ught possible 
on this project. Nick and Oakley, I 
only hope you know what you've 
gotten yoursel ves into. YOIt four 

were instrumental in the organiza-
tion and creation of this film and 
I'm thrilled I was a part of it. To all 
of this years leaders, congrantla-
tions on making the best flick th is 
org has seen 0 far, and I wish all of 
next year's leaders good luck in the 
creation f the next in the seri es. 

UC D !lien 's crew. So I get o ne 
of th se generic blanket e-mails in 
September letting me know that if 
['m interested in joining the UCSD 
men's crew team, I should head 
over to a m eeong at RIMAe. I fig-
ure, why no t - I'm already heavily 
involved in two other organi7..ations, 
why not see what else r can get into. 
All T can say is thank god I did. Zach 
J ohnson , thanks for letting me get 
involved to begin with and stay 
involved after I screwed up my foot. 
I only wish I could have made it to 
the later races and been there to 
support the team. Keebler, j eff, J oe 
(buffy), Ryan, Grant, hawn, Jason 
- thanks for keeping in touch an d 
making m e still fee l like part of the 
team even after it was apparent I 
wasn't going to get back on a boat. 1 
have no doubt that next year's team 
will kick ass and take names, and I 
only hope I can be there to see it. 

Because of space constraints I'm 
going to thank a few more people 
but 1 can't say why. Phel, thanks 
for putting up with me and for all 
your help and advice . Sky, Jenna, 
Tamara,Joe, Karen,Juliana, Louise 
and all the PAs on GMW, thank 
you all for getting involved and

of a year. To everyone above and 
anyon e reading tllis I fo rgot to 
mention, please do your best to

pussible effurt to COllle down frum

on what 's going on down here. r 
guess this is where I'm suppo cd 
to give advice I'll keep it to two 
simple points. Firsl, get Ifl\'olved! 
You are here to get an education, 
but that involve getting Out and 
getti ng involved JUSt as much as 
it does going to e1as cs. And try 
somethi ng new. Don't sot:k to your 
religio us/pol i tical/ racia I orga niza-
oon but instead get invol vcd with 
some random group on ca mpus 
if for no other reason than to see 
what it is about. Secondly, try to 
make sure you are ready for life 
after your major. What I mean by 
this is if you're studying biology, 
make sure you are interested in 
the career path that th at major will 
take you to. I have worked, in some 
capacity, for the past 10 years since 
I graduated high school and if there 
is one lesson I can pass on to you it 
is to not get stuck doing something 
you despise. It will suck the life 
right out of you. If you don't like 
what you're currendy studyi ng, get 
out now, or you 'll regret it later. 

Final words: Keep in touch!

I n my life, I have traveled to the far reaches of the globe and seen many strange and exotic 
places. Each had its own air about 
it but none were as mysterious as 
the land of Suc'd. It is a region of 
giant snakes, singing metal trees, 
huge megalithic structures and odd 
deities. 

Its tribal inhabitants are as col-
orful as they are diverse, all prac-
ticing their own unique customs, 
traditions and beliefs. ] came across 
one such tribe while exploring the 
vast "Rumi Woods" of Suc'd. They 
called themselves the lrg{mtillnu, 
and it was they who took me in, 
taught me the ways of their people 
and adopted me as one of their 
own. 

Initially I was an outsider, 
eager to immerse myself in their 
culrure and be accepted by the 
tribal leaders. But to become a 
true Irgandllnu, I had to complete 
the three stages of their sacred 
initiation rite. 

For the first stage of my initia-
tion, J traveled with the IrgandJlnu 
to the sacred city of gold they 
call "Valsegas." On this sojourn, 
I was to become familiar with the 
members of the tribe and prove my 
worthiness to all. I demonstrated 
my manhood by guzzling copious 
amounts of lrgantillnu beer with the 
heaviesr drinkers in the tribe "Ani" 
and "Tat'm." They were excellent

Emilee Schumer Assistant Business Manager 

My last four years have been measured out in Guardians. I didn't rurn 21 on May 
27, but rather on a publication 
Thursday, a cruel fa cr that had me 
crawling in Friday morning, barf 
bag in hand, to ensure the calendar 
was typed. So you can probably 
imagine why, upon the publication 
of my 240th (and final) Guardian 
issue, I'm a little freaked out. 

In place of classes, the Guardian 
has always come first for me, some-
thing I'd love Marye Anne Fox to 
scribble into the margin on my 
transcript, next to my GPA. I spent 

many a lecrure not doodling pic-
rures, but drafting "to do at work" 
lists across the top of my notes. My 
days at school consisted of three 
parts Guardian to every one part 
class, my office serving as home 
base; the Art of Espresso coffee 
cart, a close second. 

This may sound strange from 
only "the business girl," but I 
believe that r cared for my job 
the same way the editorial staff 
did theirs - I just gar paid bet-
ter. And even more importantly, a 
view of publishing from the busi-
ness end of things really broadened 

Kaia Lai/CuarcJian 

my understanding of the industry. 
Trust me, I took my job as assistant 

. business manager very seriously, 
and after next weekend, when the 
postcollege nostalgia phase kicks 
in, my relationship to the school 
will be remembered nor through 
the words "Revelle College" on 
my diploma, but through my role 
at the Guardian. 

My decision to prioritize my 
involvement with the newspa-
per has nor smnted my academic 
growth in any way. In fact, I stand 
firmly behind the declaration that 
the GUIlrdian has taught me more 
about the real world than any 
course at rhis prized university. 
Sure, Roger Revelle showed me 
the differential equation and the 
gravity constant, but I highly doubt 
either will pop up in my furure. 

Two years ago, the Gllilrdian 
found itself without a business 
manager. This siruation, despite 
serious financial repercussions, 
opened up an opporrunity for me 
more challenging than resisting 
a chai on a foggy (yes, foggy) 
La Jolla morning. I was sad to 
see Pam's sunshine disappear, but 
the rest of the business office put 
its confidence and some of Pam's 
leadership inro my hands. 

Now, I'd be lying if I said that 
the job hasn't been stressful. I've 
had to juggle office tensions of 
every kind while making sure the 
checks still roll in . I've had to adapr 
to four different business manag-
ers, five if you count rhe times 
with no ne. Each one has taughr me 
something, though, and for thar I 

Hans: Traveler remembers Irgandanu tribe 
continued from page B 1 4 

competition, and we became quite 
close by the nights end. After the 
tribe and I became fully intoxi-
cated, we migrated to a secret area 
called the 'Jungle of Rum" where 
I engaged in ceremonial dance 
with many beautiful Irganda7lu 
women. Chief "Talnoyc" even 
gran red me the privilege of danc-
ing with his daughter, the lovely 
princess "Rathme." When I left 
"Valsegas," I began to feel a true 
connection to the Irgandanu, hav-
ing made many friends and gain-
ing new insight about their ways. 

The ties I made in "Valsegas" 
were further strengthened during 
the second srage of my initiation; 
"The Festival of the Sun God." 
During this celebration, the tribes 
of Suc'd, including the Irgalldallu, 
congregate to worship the "Sun 
God," their hcad deity. 

Newcomers, such as myself, 
must drink themselves inro a 
trance-like state and embark on 
a distorted "vision quest" of sorts 
where they become one with the 
tribesman and one with the "Sun 
God." Acts of insanity, frivolous 

sexual encounters and even vomit-
ing are encouraged throughout 
the celebration, two of which I 
did with the Irgondanu. It is a very 
unifying experience for the whole 
tribe, but sadly, there are those 
tribesmen who are too timid and 
shelrered to participate in the fes-
tivities, and opt to compensare by 
doing extra "tribal duties." Such 
was the case with poor "Laimdivr," 
the village loser. 

The final stage of my initia-
tion was not done with "beer nor 
cheer," ir was done on the battle-
field. Every year, the Irga/ldanu 
engage in a vicious game called 
"Shloballs" with their evil rival 
tribe, the "Kakaloa." The rules are 
simple. Warriors of either tribe 
must smack a ball with 3 wooden 
cI ub as far as possi ble and reach as 
many of the four outposts as they 
can before the ball is thrown in by 
the opposing tribe. 

The catch is, before a warrior 
can make it pasr the second out-
post, he mu t consume a pint of 
rancid Kakaloan beer made from 
the sweat of their chief "Sevner." 
Kicking, punching, screaming and 

biting are all commonplace during 
the battle. I had a fierce alterca-
tion with a knavish little Kakaloan 
beast named "lmas." He attacked 
me with all his might, bur J struck 
him down amidst the cheers of my 
I rga7ul0111t friend s. 

With this fin al act, I became 
an i1-gandanu . Chief Tailloyc bap-
tized me by pouring (or "po'in" 
in Irgll111ulIIlI dialect) me a cer-
emonial glass of the sweet nectar 
of rhe chanda n flower. After sip-
ping the nectar, the chief and I 
did a celebratory lrgondallu pop' 
where we each grabbed rhe col-
lars of our shirts, pull ed them 
forward and released them in a 
poppi ng motion . (In other words, 
we popped o ur fu ckin ' coll ars

'
) 

Now thar I'm leavi ng the tribe, 
[ will tru ly miss my lrgllndonll 
brethren . My time with them was 
one of the most enriching and 
rewarding experi ences of my life, 
not just because they accepted 
me, bur because they made me 
fecllike I had a famil y in a foreign 
land . I know I will take them with 
me wherever the wind may carry 
me next.

am grateful. Mosr importantly, I've 
learned how to take responsibility 
for something important to mc . 

Ec;hoing Dad 's famous "glass 
half full " mentali ty, I'd say we've 
been able to rurn omerhing bad 
into something good. The strU( -
ture of the business office h:;.s 
never had room for student leader-
ship before, but this year, with the 
help of a staff passionate about sttl-
dent journalism, we've been able 
to delegate more power to those 
of us aspiring to take our ambi -
tions beyond Gilman Drive. This 
has been an incredible experience, 
challenging me ro be more proac-
tive and cultivating a pride in what 
I do. 

Of course, the GUllrdian has 
given me something even more 
powerful. Emily Dickinson once 
said, "My friends are my estate." 
My friends mea n everything to me, 
and those I picked up at tllis school 
can be traced to the Guardial/. r can 
include even my fabulous room-
mates here, for they're as GU01'dia11 
as it gets: Nicole joined us on 
our big Vegas trip last quarter, 
Michelle popped up in the staff box 
this April, and both have shared as 
many cock rails in the office as the 
rest of us. You two are the best and 
I'll miss you terribly. 

As for the others, Mather: You 
werc one of the first smiling faces 
I met in the dorms, and I hope we 
stay friends "4 life." You 're one of 
my favori te people ever, and I ca n't 
wait to kick it in the city with you 
and P.K. next year! Matt, I'm glad 
to have had you around to suffer 

through panish with, helping to 
make those msayos a little more 
bearable. 

G rant, good luck next yea r! T he 
chai will carry you through. True. 
our own Guardilln superman , I'm 
very touched by your compassion. 
Andrew, I want ru mention you 
because you have been one of the 
friend liest people I've met, and [ 
love the way you always come keep 
me company in my lonely frOnt 
office. 

Mike and Michael, I can't thank 
you enough for the trust and sup-
port you have given me and for nor 
sa botaging my tran cript to keep 
me around . I promise ro come back 
ro roast with chai! And of course, 
Clayton : You make me 'happier 
every day for choosing UCSD. I've 
loved the opporrunity to warch 
you inspire rhe rcsr of us with your 
dedication, and I can't wa ir to see 
you bring your "skills" to Berkeley 
and, some day, to Rolling Stone. 

H only 1 could Icaye you wirh 
something inspirational or pro-
found .. . bur all I can say is that 
next week, as I sip my final coffee 
cart chai, I ' ll probably rear lip a lit-
til' . Sure, I'll be sad when rhe straw 
starts making that empty, sucki ng 
sound, but in reality, rhe tears will 
have more to do with ending a 
chapter in my life that tllfned out 
to be every bit as sa ri sfyi ng as [ 
hoped it to be, despite its affiliation 
with a science-loving, party-hating 
school like this one. 

Somehow, I found what I want-
ed, and I don't think ir gets any 
better than tha t.
