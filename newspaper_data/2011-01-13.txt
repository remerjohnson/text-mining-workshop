Donald Glover, who performed at the Sun God Festival last year, will be back on campus 
next month to headline the Winter 
Triton Festival comedy event.

“Donald Glover was our �rst choice,” 
AVP of Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
said. “It just worked out perfectly. He got 
such a great response at Sun God. We re-
ally wanted him back.”

He will be joined at the festival by 
comedian Dat Phan, a San Diego native 
who won the �rst season of NBC’s “Last 
Comic Standing.”

�e festival — currently scheduled 
for Feb. 5 in the Price Center West Ball-
room — will be free to students, who can 
get up to two wristbands with a valid 
UCSD ID at the UCSD box o�ce.  

Although a ticket will be required, it 
does not guarantee entry to ensure that 

the ballroom is at maximum capacity. As 
a result, the show will be oversold. �ose 
who cannot get into the main venue may 
be able to watch a live feed of the show 
at the Lo�.

“It’s called ‘festival’ because we also 
have [programming at] the Lo� on that 
night,” Wong said in an e-mail. “Cur-
rently, [it’s] an over�ow for the ballroom. 
We are looking into a live feed so people 
who couldn’t get into the ballroom can 
still enjoy the show.”

�e event is designed to be an an-
nual complement to FallFest and Sun 
God Festival.  �is is the �rst year of the 
festival, which is funded by A.S. Coun-
cil’s mandated reserves that is composed 
of unused fees from past students. Ac-
cording to Vice President of Student Life 
Kristina Pham, if the event is successful 
and continues beyond this year, orga-

nizers will need to �nd a new source of 
funding.

WTF will not, unlike the Sun God 
Festival, feature student organizations 
or vendors. Artist merchandise will be 
available for purchase.

�e show represents a shi� on the 
part of the A.S. Concerts and Events of-
�ce, as the majority of the shows it puts 
on are concerts. Pham said that other 
shows were considered, but the council 
decided a comedy show would be a good 
event for Winter Quarter.  Pham also 
expressed enthusiasm for the comedians 
that signed on for the show.

For the past several years, Winter 
Quarter has lacked the major social 
events that mark the other academic 
quarters.  Previously, WinterFest pro-

For the first time in the UC system’s 
143-year history, revenue from student fees 
will exceed the state’s contribution to the 
university operating budget. On Jan. 10, Gov. 
Jerry Brown put forward a budget proposal 
that cuts $1.4 billion from California’s higher 
education system — $500 million of which 
will be taken from the UC system. 

The rest of the $1.4 billion will be deducted 
from the CSU system and community 
colleges. Although the UC system has 
experienced major cuts before, the proposed 
$500 million cut would eliminate about one-
sixth of current state funding.

UC Student Association President 
Claudia Magana said the UCSA board is 
working with budget analysts to get an 
understanding of the budget issue before 
deciding what do to next.

“We first have to figure out what we can 
do,” Magana said. “We hope to talk about 
what action plan to take at the Student Lobby

WINTER 
SHUFFLE

After the D.R.E.A.M. Act failed in the U.S. 
Senate last month, proponents who want to 
allow eligible undocumented students to receive 
the same financial aid benefits as residents are 
reintroducing a new version of the act under a 
new governor’s office. 

On Tuesday, Jan. 11, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo 
(D-Los Angeles) — the author of the original 
California D.R.E.A.M. Act — introduced a bill 
to grant illegal immigrants access to community 
colleges’ Board of Governors fee waiver, as well 
as additional financial aid programs.

“The biggest issue is letting people know that 

this not going to take away from the current 
students,” Ceja said. 

Although more students will be eligible to 
receive financial aid, the funds for the aid 
packages will come from a private pool of 
funds, so the change would not place additional 
financial burdens on the state. 

“When we presented the D.R.E.A.M. Act, we 
were very careful to take care of two key issues,” 
Field Deputy Fredy Ceja said. “The first is that 
this will not take any existing resources from 
students. AB 130, which is the new title for 
the bill, is going to allow for institutionalized 
funding, which is fee waivers and scholarships 
from each university.”

These funds from individual institutions 

can draw from sources like alumni associations 
and university scholarship programs, according 
to Ceja.

“There have been a lot of universities 
who wanted to give scholarships out to 
undocumented students,” Ceja said. “But the law 
being the way it is right now, they were scared to 
give money to undocumented students.”

Ceja said the law will help both the students 
and the universities.

This law would actually clarify the 
ambiguities with giving money to undocumented 
students and it would pretty much give them a 
green light to go ahead and allow undocumented

CLOSE QUARTERS By Kat Truong

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee

Conference that will happen at the 
end of February in Sacramento.”

The budget is a move to confront 
California’s estimated $25.4 billion 
deficit. Brown suggested at Monday’s 
press conference that it was time for 
the state to pay its debts, in spite of 
the inevitable difficulties ahead.

Brown suggested a five-year 
extension of higher taxes — a plan 
that requires voter approval — to 
mitigate the damage created by the 
state deficit. Brown plans to maintain 
current funding levels for K-12 
schools. The rest of the $12.5-billion 
in cuts will also reduce funding in 
welfare and social services.

“The president quite clearly has 
said, on more than one occasion, that 
his preference is not to have to raise 
fees,” UCOP spokesperson Peter King 
said. “Unquestionably, there will be 
sacrifices and pain.” 

Although legislators invested an 
extra $370 million in the UC system 
last year, the Regents still hit students 
with an 8-percent fee increase in 
November, in addition to the 32 
percent hike in fees last year.

“The responsible approach is to 
take the governor at his word and 
assume the cuts are coming and 
work hard to decide the right way to 
execute them,” King said. “We are still 
going to be in Sacramento making 
the case that we are tremendously 
important to the future of this state.”

Vice President of External Affairs 
Michael Lam is skeptical about what 
the UC system will do for its students.

“So far, [UC President Mark 
G. Yudof] has been all statement, 
statement, statement — no action,” 
Lam said. “If he hasn’t done anything 
for us in the past, I don’t think he will 
do anything for us now.”

UCSA’s response statement 
critically noted that this historic 
shift in overall contribution to the 
UC system essentially goes against 
the vision of an affordable college 
education outlined in the California 
Master Plan.

“It’s unfair because there has 
never before been such a dependency 
on student fees,” Lam said. 

Whether or not these cuts will 
be an effective long-term solution 
still remains highly contentious, as 

students face the looming probability 
of another fee increase within the 
next year.

“I know we are in debt, but these 
are too drastic of cuts for one year. 
Even if they cut that down by half, 
it would still be too much. We voted 
him in for governor because we 
thought he understood that we could 
barely pay for school,” Lam said.

Lam senses that UCSD will feel 
the impact immediately. 

“Once Fall Quarter [2011] hits, 
when a new generation of students 
enter UCSD, the changes will already 
be taking place … increased tuition 
maybe, but we can’t say for sure,” 
Lam said.

As the UC system strives to 
maintain its position as the nation’s 
best-ranked public higher education 
system, the proposed budget will 
not make the journey any more 
affordable in the near future for 
its most important recipients, the 
students.

“These [budget plans] are good 
for California, but education should 
not be cut because education is what 
we all seek to achieve,” Lam said. “It’s 

like an entity of California. Right now 
is not the time for drastic cuts.”

Last night’s A.S. Council meeting started out amusingly as several councilmembers competed to 
be in the Panhellenic Sorority Kappa 
Alpha Theta’s philanthropic fashion 
show., called KATwalk. 

AVP of College 
Affairs Leonard 
Bobbit walked 
against Sixth 
College Senator 
P a r m i n d e r 
Sandhu. Bobbit’s 
flamboyant walk 
was a clear winner compared to the 
slumped, uneasy walking posture of 
Sandhu — who was pressured by fellow 
members to compete. A.S. President 
Wafa Ben Hassine walked against 
Warren College President Alyssa 
Wing, who stole the show with disco 
hand motions.

The meeting quickly transitioned 
back to business. AVP of Student 
Organizations Carli Thomas said she 
will be attending multiple org meetings 
to get feedback on what organizations 
want from council.

Sixth College Senator Kristian 
Castro and Sandhu repped Sixth 
College’s Semi-Formal, which will be 
held on Jan. 29. The Oz-themed dance 
will have a LED dance floor and shuttle 
transportation. DJ Lisa will spin the 
jams. Sandhu also reminded council 
that applications to be a trustee for the 
Student Foundation, which gives schol-
arships to current students.

Ben Hassine sadly informed coun-
cil that Campuswide Senator Adriana 
Garcia sent in a resignation letter stating 
that she was too overwhelmed to continue.

AVP of Student Advocacy Arohi 
Sharma said a new draft of the revised 
Student Code of Conduct will be 
released within the next few weeks. 
Presentations about the new draft will 
take place all over campus to obtain 
student feedback. 

AVP of Academic Affairs Desiree 
Prevo said the academic senators will be 
meeting with Associate Vice Chancellor 
of Undergraduate Education Barbara 
Sawrey for lunch at the Faculty Club. 
As a social sciences major, Prevo said 

the department 
was poorly repre-
sented at the job 
fair. She plans to 
speak to the Career 
Services Center.

AVP of Local 
Affairs Matthew 

Vu discussed multiple conferences on 
diversity and high school outreach that 
will occur this quarter. He also men-
tioned a pillow fight at Library Walk 
on Friday at 12:50 p.m. to protest the 
governor’s proposed budget cuts.

All-Campus Transfer Association 
Chair Adam Powers is getting more 
information from the Transportation 
Services Director on the removal of 
student parking spaces. 

AVP of Athletic Relations Pauline 
Nuth set up a reward system for stu-
dents who attend basketball games. 
They will receive points for prizes. 

Campuswide Senator Anish 
Bhayani informed council that 
ARSFAB (Athletics,  Recreation and 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board) is 
changing their charter to fit council’s 
and GSA council’s standards to pass 
a referendum fee, which will fund the 
Canyonview Pool facility. 

The new Advocate General is 
David Conant, who represents council 
in hearings at the A.S. Judicial Board. 

The meeting ended in just over 
an hour with an announcement from 
Sandhu that cupcake store Sprinkles 
opens today at La Jolla Village Center. 
The councilmembers broke into 
excited discussions while Executive 
Assistant Heather Belk attempted to 
take roll call over the animated council 
members.

The phrase “dance to the beat” 
is taking on new meaning: Research 
shows that the motor system is stimu-
lated by musical rhythms before any 
movement actually occurs. 

According to Neurosciences 
Institute fellow Aniruddh Patel, clini-
cal observations show a correlation 
between how music and movement 
are processed in the brain even when 
the body is still.

“[We found] activation in what 
looks like the motor areas of the 
brain; even though you are not mov-
ing you are listening to musical 
rhythms, suggesting that the motor 
system is used to analyze sound 
even when you are not moving,” 
Patel said.

Using various brain imaging 
techniques, Patel and colleague 
John Iversen  — whose research 
looks at how humans use sensory 
stimuli to perceive the world — 
found that both the auditory and 
motor system activate in response 
to musical beats. 

For people with Parkinson’s dis-
ease — a degenerative nervous sys-
tem disease that impairs one’s motor 
abilities — listening to musical beats 
can facilitate movement.

“Nobody really understands the 
mechanism by which that works,” 
Patel said. “Ultimately, the research 
could help design better therapies for 
these patients [with nervous system 
diseases].”

To understand the mechanisms 
through which music is processed, 
using a magnetoencephalography 
(MEG) machine, Iversen and Patel 
measured the brain waves generated 
when different individuals listen to a 
particular rhythm.

“If you play different rhythms 
to them, you can see how the brain 
responds to the rhythms,” Iversen 

said. “So it’s 
the same 
sound that’s 
going into the 
person’s ear, 
but what they 
are ‘hearing’ 
[or perceiv-
ing] is differ-
ent because 
they’re hearing 
the beat differ-
ently.”

Correlating 
the rhythm 
with resulting 
brain waves, 
they then look 
at the different 
parts of the 
brain that con-
trol the timing 
of the beat. 

Their research also focuses on the 
correlation of music and language in 
the brain. 

According to Patel, music, lan-
guage and speech are processed 
together and have similar processing 
pathways. What applies to music, 
then, can also be applied to speech 
and movement.

ÒPeople who have stuttering can 
sing beautifully with no problem,Ó 
music professor Steven Schick said. 

To further explore the extent to 
which this overlap occurs, the two 
neuroscientists and Schick will pres-

ent at “Rhythm, the Brain and a 
Drum,” hosted by the Bronowski 
forum. 

The event — part of a series 
of talks designed to unite the arts 
and sciences — will include per-
formances by Schick, a world-
renowned percussionist, and host 
an open forum for discussion on 
the perception of rhythm and how 
it affects speech. 

“This is a convergence of three 
people working on the same topic 
from different perspectives,” Schick 
said. “As musicians, we’re always 
aware of the relationship of musical 
phrases to daily speech.” 

According to Schick, mechanisms 
allowing music processing have not 
been studied, though music is pro-
cessed systematically. 

The forum brings together dif-
ferent perspectives to further under-
stand how language, speech and cul-
ture influence the composition of 
musical beats. 

“Rhythm, the Brain, and a Drum” 
will be held today, Jan. 13, at the 
Neurosciences Institute, located at 
1640 John J. Hopkins Dr. The event is 
free and open to the public.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/OPINIONTHURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 2011

Lots of people compare sorority rush week to speed dating: all fake smiles and designer jeans. 
To me, it was more like a week-long 
marathon of incessant chatter and 
high heels, leaving everyone who 
dared to participate with a hoarse 
voice and often a battered ego. 

Most people don’t really know 
what they’re getting into until they’ve 
found themselves neck deep. I myself 
had no intention of rushing, and 
signed up just before registration 
closed, after my suitemates listed all 
the successful women (like Jennifer 
Garner and Hillary Clinton) who had 
joined sororities. 

While I was just along for the ride, 
some girls take rush very seriously. 
One came armed with a letter of 
recommendation from a sorority girl 
turned businesswoman/soccer mom, 
though that didn’t help her make the 
final cut. Others were devastated by 
“suicide bidding” (only accepting an 
invitation to their specific sorority 
of choice, or none at all), which left 
them crushed, in tears and stilettos at 
Price Center Plaza, by the bitter end. 

Meeting each sorority was 
exhausting. At times I felt it would be 
more productive to just walk in, recite 
my major, college and year, get all of 
that baloney out of the way. We were 
advised by Rho Chi’s (sorority advi-
sors/sheepdogs) to refrain from talk-
ing about three things: “boys, booze 
and bucks.” (They don’t want anyone 
to choose based on what frats they 
hang out with, how hard they party 
or how expensive it is to be a mem-
ber, which varies for each).

 At one party, I asked a girl about 
her experience with fraternities. She 
became uneasy and settled on an 
automated response: “You’ll meet all 
kinds of guys in fraternities!” (I clearly 
had not learned the ‘Three B’s’ yet.)

Not everyone was like a fembot, 
though. On one occasion, a girl and I 
were even able to skip the small talk 
for something I actually care about: 
video games. It was refreshing to 
finally talk to someone I could see 
as a friend. Then the girl’s sorority 
dropped me after that meeting.

And being double rushed — a 
standard practice that pairs one 
sorority girl with two rushers — is 
nothing less than hearing a car alarm 
go off incessantly for hours without 
being able to stop it. 

One sorority girl, after hearing 
that another girl and I had been 
double rushed with several times 
together, thought it would be fun if 
we introduced each other. It sounded 
fine, until my double-rusher started 
talking. She said that I love the beach 
(quite the opposite, actually), I love 
to surf (uh, more like terrified of the 
ocean) and then ran out of material. 
She couldn’t offer anything but flat-
out lies, which made me wonder: Is 
anyone actually listening to me?

After bid day, I was thrilled to 
get my top choice … and get out of 
my heels. Some didn’t, but were still 
happy; others were devastated. So 
what’s my final impression of rush? 
It’s akin to the college process; you 
can be fully qualified and not get in, 
end up somewhere that you never 
expected, experience every emotion, 
and in the end, there will be explana-
tion to why things ended up the way 
they did.

I n Fall 2009, when the Board of Regents approved a 32-percent fee increase, students rioted. When 
they approved another for the wealthi-
est students last fall, students rioted. 
And when a UCSD-specific campus 
technology fee was proposed at the 
end of last quarter, students were little 
more than confused. 

Jeff Henry, Director of Academic 
Computing and Media Services, 
proposed a quarterly per-unit fee for 
maintaining and updating on-campus 
technology in December, though 
there still remain more questions than 

answers. 
Henry explained that UCSD needs 

$1.1 million in startup funds and 
another $4 million per year to main-
tain technology on campus. Right 
now, the university has been footing 
the bill for all our technological needs. 

The confusion begins within the 
ACMS department. While Henry’s 
proposed fee will charge students $5 
per unit each quarter with a cap at 15 
units (or $80 per quarter), Associate  
Director of ACMS Christine Bagwell 
said the fee will be $4 per unit. The 
difference between the two propos-

als is approximately $1.3 million, so 
it’s more than a little important to get 
these facts straightened out.

If the tech fee passes, ours will 
be the first flagship UC campus to 
impose a fee of this kind. 

The per-unit proposal also pres-
ents another campus first; no other 
fee is determined by a student’s course 
load. The assumption here is that a 
student taking more units will be a 
bigger drain on university resources, 
though not all classes, of course, use 

One week after being sworn in as governor, Jerry Brown has released a drastic budget to     
tackle the state’s $20-billion deficit, 
which includes a $1.4 billion cut from 
higher education.

Pending the budget’s approval by 
state congress, the cuts will take a 
painful toll. Although the $500-mil-
lion reduction may not seem as 
severe next to several billion-dollar 
cuts to California’s welfare and health 
care programs, the UC system said 
in a recent statement that the state 
general’s 16.4 percent in funding sup-
port will not suffice. (In other words, 
tuition will continue to rise.)

In the 143-year history of the 
UC system, this is the first time that 
students will pay more for the uni-

versity’s operating budget than the 
state will. What’s more, funding will 
return to 1988 levels, according to a 
statement in response to the proposed 
budget, when there were 69 percent 
fewer students than the current 
235,000.

Coupled with concerns over qual-
ity education and access in addition 
to high demand for a UC education 
(this year’s freshman class witnessed 
the highest application rate in UC 
history), the cutbacks will force the 
UC system to seek undesirable alter-
natives — like offering a UC degree 
online — to make ends meet.

For the higher education sector, 
$1.4 billion will be cut, including 
about $500 million from the CSU sys-
tem and $400 million from commu-

nity colleges. K-12 education funding 
will remain intact. 

The new budget proposes $12.5 
billion in total spending reductions 
statewide, $12 billion in revenue 
extensions and $1.9 billion in other 
solutions to close the gap and provide 
for a $1 billion reserve.

Brown, in fairness, is attempting 
to lead by example. He also made cuts 
to his own office last week, returning 
84 percent of the governor’s transi-
tion fund, making reductions in the 
Governor’s Office budget by cutting 
25 percent, and taking away the 
Office of the Secretary of Education 
to save a total of $7.05 million. The 
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s 
Office said the proposed budget 
“shows great promise.”

Our new governor inherited 
one hell of a mess last week, and 
is accordingly cutting nearly every 
corner of the budget. But that doesn’t 
mean we can afford to take future fee 
hikes lying down. Even those of us 
on this apathetic campus  will have 
to assume more active opposition to 
tuition increases. 

Facing sharp tuition increases, col-
lege students in the UK have staged 
demonstrations that have garnered 
headlines across the globe. They have 
halted bus lines, held 50,000-strong 
protests and occupied various build-
ings, including Oxford’s famed 
Bodleian Library. Nothing short of 
worldwide notice will communicate 
the message that we, the students, will 
refuse to pay more for less.

technologies equally.
Then there’s the issue of calcula-

tion. With Henry’s math, supposing 
that the 23,746 undergrads each take 
four classes a quarter, each student 
would generate $80 for the technol-
ogy fee, translating to about $5.3 
million per year. Even if every stu-
dent only took three classes, the fee 
would still generate $300,000 more 
than what is reportedly needed to 
maintain campus technologies. 

According to Bagwell, if the college 
councils don’t pass the technology fee, 
we are in for a world of hypotheticals. 
We could “suffer from a diminished 
experience in the classroom.” We 

might lose out more course reserves 
online. It’s possible that there will be 
fewer podcasts in the future.

Miscommunication, poor math 
and hypothetical scenarios aside, 
adding a tech fee should be at the 
bottom of our priorities. On a cam-
pus being forced to accept furlough 
days, staff reductions, layoffs and 
fewer classes, the last thing we 
should be trying to fund is keeping 
up with the latest and greatest tech-
nology trends.

While some college council 
members voting on the proposal fee 
may have the luxury of paying an 
additional $240 per year for better 
WiFi, for others it could contribute 

to the choice between a UC school 
and a CSU campus.  

We need to be looking at the big 
picture when it comes to where we 
ask students to put their money. A 
podcast isn’t much of a sacrifice in 
the name of accessibility because 
with every step we move away from 
accessibility, we move further and 
further away from the UC Master 
Plan’s ultimate goal for universal 
access to higher education.

A student-financed technology 
fund might be a workable proposal 
at another time, but with increasing 
budget cuts and tuition hikes, it’s 
just another instance of administra-
tive tone-deafness to student needs. 

Dear Editor,
“This is a sad day for California,” 

UC President Mark Yudof said, sum-
ming up the reaction to Gov. Jerry 
Brown’s proposal Monday to cut $500 
million each from the budgets of the 
UC and CSU systems, and an addi-
tional $400 million from the state’s 
community college system.

The cuts, meant to help close the 
state’s $25 billion budget gap, assume 
voters will agree to extend several 
taxes that raise $10 billion a year for 
the state. If not, cuts to higher educa-
tion could go deeper.

Brown’s proposed 2011-12 budget 
gives the UC system — for the first 
time — less money from the state than 
it gets from student tuition: $2.6 bil-
lion versus $2.8 billion. 

To many, that represents the priva-
tization of the nation’s premier public 
university system and can easily be a 
rallying cry for student protesters.

“The crossing of this threshold 
should be profoundly disturbing to all 
Californians,” Yudof said Monday.  
Student Regent Jesse Cheng called it a 
“dangerous crossroads” for California 
to shift primary support of the UC 
system  from a public to a private 
source — particularly onto middle-
class students whose income is too 
high for public grants but too low for 
the UC system’s rising price tag. 
In November, the UC Regents 
approved an 8-percent tuition increase. 
Tuition will be $11,124 next fall, when 
the full cost to attend will top $30, 000. 

“It’s terrible,” said Claudia 
Magaña, president of the UC Students 
Association, who has seen courses cut 
and library hours reduced at UC Santa 
Cruz.

Yudof joined CSU Chancellor 
Charles Reed and community college 
Chancellor Jack Scott to warn that 

the total proposed cut of $1.4 billion 
to higher education would actually 
undermine the state’s effort to get 
back in good financial shape. “Now is 
not the time to shrink public higher 
education, but to grow it,” the three 
said, calling the three higher education 
systems “the economic engines of the 
state.”

“The road to recovery from this 
recession and prosperity far beyond it 
runs straight through our many cam-
puses,” they said. 

Brown’s budget includes a proposal 
to raise community college fees to $36 
per course unit, from $26.

That would generate enough to 
support an additional 50,000 students 
— but overall budget cuts would still 
close the doors for up to 350,000 stu-
dents at California’s 110 community 
colleges if they are approved, Scott 
said, noting that even small increases 
in the number of graduates translate 
into billions more in tax revenue for 
the state’s economy.

For the UC and CSU systems, a $1 
billion reduction would bring the uni-
versities back to about the same level 
of state funding each received in 1999: 
nearly $2.6 billion for UC, and about 
$2.3 billion for CSU. But CSU, for 
example, enrolls 70,000 more students 
today than in 1999, Reed said. Recent 
budget cuts have forced its 23 cam-
puses to turn away 40, 000 students 
over the last two years.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIANÊ THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 2011Ê NEWS

By Robert Pond
Staff Writer

The International Studies 
Program website — isp.ucsd.edu — 
was hacked on Nov. 11 and has been 
inaccessible from off campus ever 
since.

Currently, visitors can access the 
site from anywhere on campus, as 
the site is protected by the UCSD 
network.

“A compromised system is 
blocked at the campus edge to secure 
the privacy of visitors [like] students, 
staff, faculty,” university spokes-
person Christine Clark said in an 
e-mail. “The compromise is unlikely 
to spread to other machines inside 
the UCSD network.”

Clark said the university is 
addressing the issue and the site will 
be fixed as soon as possible, with no 
financial repercussions. 

The details of how the system 
was hacked will not be revealed due 
to security issues, Clark said.

“That information is not pub-
lic to protect the functionality of 
the site,” Clark said. “There was no 
financial or student information 
hacked or viruses passed.”

International Studies Program 

Director Julie Vitale said the pro-
gram staff sent out course descrip-
tions for this academic year’s winter 
and spring quarters shortly after the 
website’s crash.  

“At this time, it is only viewable 
on campus,” Vitale said. “Hopefully 
it has not been too detrimental.” 

Course descriptions were sent by 
e-mail to all international studies 
majors on Nov. 12.

“I’ve go on it a lot during the 
quarter, but I haven’t been on [over] 
break,” Muir College sophomore 
and international studies major 
Madeline Krieg said. 

According to Vitale, the pro-
gram cannot determine the num-
ber of students who may have been 
deterred from signing up for the 
program’s classes. 

“It’s hard to say, just because we 
have no way of statistically telling,” 
Vitale said.

Students with questions about 
classes who cannot access the web-
site should e-mail the international 
studies program at ERC Admin 
Bldg., Suite 100 for academic advis-
ing.

tinued three years due to poor attendance.
Since his appearance at the Sun God Festival in 2010, 

Glover has been busy.  His TV show, NBC’s “Community,” 
was picked up for a second season, and he received the 
Rising Comedy Star Award at the Just for Laughs Festival 
this past summer.

Dat Phan — who grew up in the San Diego suburbs 
about 20 miles from UCSD — rose to prominence in 2003 
when he won “Last Comic Standing” and has released a 
DVD and a CD of his material.

“It is nice to come home a�er a busy tour to make ev-
eryone laugh,” Phan said. “I really look forward to this up-
coming show.”

Students are excited about the comedians as well.  

“I really like Dat Phan, what I’ve seen of his act is hilari-
ous,” Warren College senior Steven Kennedy said.

Students expressed support for the idea of a com-
edy show rather than another concert. Others, who also 
wished to remain anonymous, felt that given the current 
state of the school’s budget, the event is needless and a 
waste of money.  

While current student fees do not fund the festival — 
which costs $31,980 — some students felt that the money 
could still be better spent elsewhere.

students to compete for those monies.”
Ceja said universities have the 

funds to provide undocumented 
students financial aid.

“There’s a vast pool of private 
money out there, especially coming 
from alumni associations, that 
some students [like] undocumented 
students are unable to access,” he said. 
“This bill allows them to access that 
money [and allows] universities to 
give money to undocumented students 
that is not taking any resources away 
from anybody.”

The second issue Ceja addresses 
in AB 131, a separate bill that allows 
undocumented students who are 
California residents to apply for 
Cal Grants — a program funded by 
the state that provides low-income 
students with maximum of $11,124 
in financial aid per year in the UC 
system.

“If the governor agrees to it, to 
allow the Cal Grants to be competitive, 
[then] now-undocumented students 
would be vying for those Cal Grants 
as well,” Ceja said. 

Cedillo’s bill is based on one he 

originally proposed in 2006, when it 
passed in the state senate and assembly 
but was vetoed four times by former 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

“This is a legislative agenda [Cedillo] 
pursued year after year and, even after 
getting the California D.R.E.A.M. Act 
vetoed by Gov. Schwarzenegger four 
times, he was going to push one more 
time,” Ceja said. 

In the veto message last year, 
Schwarzenegger said it was not the 
right time to pass the act, in light of 
the state’s economy.

 The UC system was supportive of 
AB 450, the first D.R.E.A.M. Act bill.

“We do anticipate that we will once 
again support both of these measures,” 
UCOP spokesperson Steve Montiel said.

Supporters of the D.R.E.A.M. Act 
said they would now have a better 
chance of passing the bill, as Gov. Jerry 
Brown is a Democrat.

“This is [Cedillo’s] last legislative 
year in the legislature so he wants to 
make sure that he goes in there with 
the new administration with Jerry 
Brown, who is a lot friendlier to our 
issues, and keep pushing his agenda,” 
Ceja said.

Right now, Cedillo’s office is 

focused on gathering support for the 
bill.

“The next step is to rally up the 
coalition of labor leaders, businesses, 
college students [and] community 
leaders who have an interest in allowing 
the undocumented population to 
continue their education,” Ceja said. 
“We’ve always said that it doesn’t 
make sense that the state of California 
provides a free public education [for] 
K-12 to undocumented students and 
then drop them in the end.” 

The bill will first go through the 
state assembly, jump to senate and 
then to the governor’s desk. 

“The governor spoke very highly 
of the D.R.E.A.M. act,” Ceja said. 
“He said that he still supports it 100 
percent. Everything looks really good 
for us this year. We do have a governor 
that is very open and candid about 
supporting the D.R.E.A.M. act.”

If the bill is approved, California 
will be the third state, following Texas 
and New Mexico to, offer financial 
aid to undocumented immigrant 
students.

Bromantic Action-Comedy 
Plays Movie Star Roulette. 

By Krystle Wong

The Men Who 
Kicked the 

Hornet’s Nest

L ike its titular hero, “The Green Hornet” is less about defeating bad things than befriending them.  Despite director 
Michel Gondry (“Eternal Sunshine of the 
Spotless Mind”) in the driver’s seat and 
writer/actor Seth Rogen riding shotgun, “The 
Green Hornet”’s original 1930s cohesion is 
lost in a haze of clunky kitsch — choosing to 
follow its own invented premise.

“Hornet”’s Britt Reid is 
the son of wealthy newspaper 
publisher James Reid, who 
dies from an allergic reaction 
to a bee sting. An irrespon-
sible playboy who has little in 
common with his hardwork-
ing father, Reid is unfazed 
by his death (“He was a bit 

of a dick”) and apathetic to the media empire 
left in his incapable hands. Shortly thereaf-
ter, Reid is introduced to Kato — a talented 
Chinese mechanic with high-precision martial 

arts and latte-making skills (played by Jay 
Chou).  

But here’s where “Hornet”’s logic starts 
to sting: Reid unexpectedly decides the duo 
should use its untapped potential to achieve 
his childhood dream of crime fighting. The 
billionaire hopes to rid L.A. of its local bad-

dies by making nice with them — minus, 
thank God, the spandex.

“Green” is one way to describe Rogen’s 
action debut — even trimmed down and 
gussied up, the funnyman is all klutz and 

INTERVIEW

At this point, I’m pretty sure it’s safe to admit that I don’t pay for my music. I can’t remember the last time I bought a 
CD, and the lowly vinyl collection I began 
my sophomore year of high school is most-

ly comprised of my parents’ old records. It 
now sits in my room, collecting dust.

It may not be as cool, but I am a proud 
member of the digital generation. (Of 
course, I support music in other ways, like 
writing columns and wasting half my pay-
checks on concerts).

So when Apple announced last 
November that the Beatles would finally 
be joining the iTunes Store, I was more 
than a little underwhelmed. Are there 
really people who don’t already have the 
Beatles on their iPod? I thought everyone 
grew up with classic rock enthusiasts for 
parents, who had copies of Abbey Road and 
Revolver just waiting to be uploaded to the 
nearest computer. To me, paying money to 
listen to the Beatles, of all bands, is a com-
pletely baffling experience. 

Despite this, Apple launched a massive 
marketing campaign for the store addi-
tion — including front-page ads on the 
company’s site and prominent TV spots 
— because if any band is underrated, it’s 
clearly the Beatles. To my surprise, though, 
the gimmick worked: According to Apple, 
within the first week, more than 450,000 
albums and two million individual tracks 
were sold on iTunes worldwide. 

With such lucrative digital download 
sales, it’s peculiar that the Beatles’ company, 
Apple Corps., even waited. The Beatles 
were the last of the legends holding out on 
Steve Jobs (Led Zeppelin and the Rolling 
Stones were previously apprehensive about 
the iTunes Store). 

Their hesitation had more to do with 
finance than philosophy. According to a 
recent report from Reuters, Apple Corps. 
sealed a special licensing-type deal with 
Apple Inc. (confusing, I know) to get the

Liverpool natives in the store. For the first time in the 
company’s history, Apple Inc. is paying the band directly, 
rather than the traditional royalty setup, through which 
artists take in around 20 to 25 percent of the total revenue. 

Basically, the Fab Four are making bank. Again.
But perhaps there is no better measure of the Beatles’ 

influence on modern music — and no better reasons to 
ignore the Apple hoopla — than to take it from artists 
themselves. If you go to the iTunes front page, you’ll be 
confronted with a special playlist: “Your Favorite Artists, 
Their Favorite Beatles Songs.” Several modern musicians 
have picked their favorite tracks — complete with enlight-
ening explanations. 

Coldplay’s admiration for “Something” reflects the 
tuneful melodies they adapted from the band, while 
Ke$has explanation of her choice — the simple and unde-
niably fun “I Want to Hold Your Hand” — is perfectly 
astute; “It’s what pop music should be,” she suggests (she 
should listen to her own remarks). 

Artists disagreed: Sia called “Blackbird” the best song 
ever written; Rascal Flatts called “Yesterday” the best song 
ever written; Mike Posner opts for “A Day in the Life.”

They’re all great, guys. Duh. 
Trey Songz described “If I Fell” as “such a dope song,” 

explaining that: ““The harmonies are craaaazy!!” — clearly 
the most clever observation ever uttered about the Beatles.

And the teens love ‘em too! “Strawberry Fields 
Forever” apparently makes Selena Gomez “happy and sad 
at the same time,” while her boyfriend Justin Bieber claims 
that “Let It Be” has helped him “accept the hard times in 
life.” 

B.o.B. is best of all: He says his “favorite song on 
Beatles Rock Band” is, hands down, “Paperback Writer.” 

These futile observations are proof that — when an 
artist is as massively important as the Beatles — there 
comes a point when there is simply nothing interesting to 
say about them.

 Everyone knows the Beatles and everyone always 
will. They’ve become engrained in nearly every aspect of 
our popular culture, infiltrating even our most treasured 
childhood memories. So I don’t need the Beatles on 
iTunes. I’m stuck with ‘em forever anyway.

Diaz plays smart femme fatale 
Lenore Case in her perky, 
doe-eyed best, Chou’s broken 
English slows the already-
decelerated action sequences 
and overqualified Christoph 
Waltz plays arch-nemesis 
Chudofsky, a part originally 
meant for Nicholas Cage — 
who demanded the villain 
speak with a Jamaican accent 

(Gondry was reportedly 
relieved when the “National 
Treasure” star abdicated his 
role).

Though Chou’s tongue-
tricks may not be up to speed, 
his fighting style is: Fighting 
sequences are slowed by 
Kato-vision — a 3D-tunnel 
view that follows the actor 
throughout his scenes — 
playing up Chou’s form as he 
high-kicks and jumps with 
exacting timing and precision. 

But with such an incon-
sistent mess on its hands, 
“The Green Hornet” has 
squandered inherent movie 
buzz and marred any cin-
ematographic merits. Still, 
superhero-flick fanatics will 
probably give “Hornet”’s crew 
the box office moneymaker 
that Sony Pictures is betting 
on. To those less devout to 
the world of comic book old-
ies: Wait for a more prolific 
green hero to take the silver 
screen come June.

Since 1993, Dallas rockers Old 97’s have helped pioneer the 
alt-country genre alongside other bar band notables including 
Drive-By Truckers, The Jayhawks and Wilco. Lead man Rhett 
Miller’s smokey, poignant lyrics drive pop-rock anthems such 
as “19” and “Dance With Me” with radio-ready ease. The 
group released their eighth studio album The Grand Theatre, 
Volume One last October. The Belly Up show is scheduled with 
opener Langhorne Slim. (RE)

snapping, pens clicking, sheets rustling 
— is filtered through kaleidoscopic mel-
odies and hip-hop beats. Tracks like the 
hushed and funky “Lovely Bloodflow” 
and vocal-sampling “Maximalist” soar 
and contort with ease. Pepper in some 
Bee Gees falsetto and acoustic instru-
mentation, and the product is a thrill-
ingly modern exploration of a genre.

Baths’ Will Wiesenfeld recently spoke 
with The Guardian about his influences, 
his new music video and the cure-all for 
suburban boredom. 

“Hold on, I’m saving a video game 
right now,” says 21-year-old Wiesenfeld. 
Despite his age, the man is a seasoned 
musician with a serious knack for pro-
duction. “I guess it’s not a widely known 
fact about me, but Cerulean is, like, the 
20th complete album I’ve made in my 
life. Eight years doesn’t seem that long, 
but I’m very productive and I’m making 
music all the time.” 

Yet it is only recently, after being 
invited by fellow L.A. beatmaker 
Daedelus to share a stage with rising 
electronic notables Nosaj Thing and 
Flying Lotus, that Wiesenfeld reached 
the national ear. “I remember the first 
time I was mentioned on [music web 
site] Pitchfork,” he said. “I had been fol-
lowing it for a couple of years, so it was 
just a very cool manifestation of some-
thing more than just me recording in 
my bedroom. It was very, very epic.”

The success wasn’t anticipated. 
“It was definitely a surprise,” says 
Wiesenfeld. “The way I talked to my 

label Anticon about [the album]—we 
both just wanted it to be a mild intro-
duction to my sound. But it got a lot 
more attention than we expected, and 
that was just awesome.” 

Cerulean is dense with sounds and 
samples that are stripped from their 
contexts to create a familiar, though 
exotic, soundscape. “When a rock band 
is writing a song, they use lyrics or 
instruments,” Wiesenfeld says. “Those 
are their tools. In electronic music, the 
entire planet is at your disposal. You 
have a microphone and can record 
whatever you want. But it’s never a 
conscious thing like, ‘Now it’s time for 
scissors!’ It’s just whatever I happen to 
think fits the emotion of the song.” 

The music video for “Lovely 
Bloodflow,” featuring a samurai death 
sequence, is surprisingly cinematic for 
the DIY nature of Wiesenfeld’s sound. 
“I’m very glad it turned out like that. 
The combination was very surreal and 
kind of unnerving.” 

He describes filming as “a very 
involved process. My friends Alex 
Takacs and Joe Nankin made the video, 
and at first I was very nervous about 
it, because I try and maintain a certain 
look for myself. But upon talking to 
them, I realized their ideas and visual 
aesthetic are literally exactly what I’m 
into. It was kind of creepy.”

The artists he is into are notably 
bizarre. “Björk,” insists Wiesenfeld, 
“is more than just an influence on my 
music. She’s a life influence. She’s what 
got me started. It’s this otherworldly, 
majestic experience when you listen 

to her music, and it would be a dream 
come true to eventually maintain a 
career like that.” 

Wiesenfeld also finds inspiration in 
modern art, from the commercial films 
of Christopher Nolan, to the obscurity 
of late-night television. “The best thing 
ever was seeing The Room at the Sunset 
5 in L.A. and that same night Tim and 
Eric [of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, 
Great Job!] were there. It was just the 
most surreal thing. So epic.”

Growing up in Chatsworth, an unre-
markable suburb of L.A., Wiesenfeld’s 
creative pursuits sprung from his desire 
to escape. “It just makes you have that 
mindset, and you try and look for things 
that are more alien and different than 
what you’re used to. There’s just noth-
ing out here, so I had to get everything 
from the Internet or the other parts of 
Los Angeles. It really makes you want to 
create that world for yourself. For me, 
music was the way to do that.” 

Maybe it’s this same explorative drive 
that has crushed any possibility of a 
Cerulean, Pt. 2. 

“It would kill me to make the same 
album again. Cerulean is great and it’s 
its own thing, but I’m definitely mental-
ly and creatively done with it,” he said. 
“The next album I’m going to make is 
going to be almost antithetical to how 
positive Cerulean is. It’s going to be 
completely different.” 

Baths will perform at the Loft on Jan. 
14. $8 with student ID, $10 for non-
students.

As the latest in a recent stream of goth-pop acts that includes 
London’s hugely suc-
cessful the xx, upcoming 
Brooklyn duo Minks aim 
to resurrect the moody 
‘80s charm of legendary 
bands like the Cure and 
Joy Divison. And, like 
the xx, the selling point 
of Minks’ debut, By The 
Hedge, lies almost entirely 
in the time-tested combi-
nation of seductive boy-
girl harmonies and shim-
mering hooks.

The album opens with 
“Kusmi,” a sugary, synth-
drenched soundtrack to an 
autumn make-out session 
under high school bleach-
ers. It’s the perfect sum-
mation of By The Hedge as 
a whole: clanging guitars, 
reverb-heavy vocals, a 
charming chorus and some 
cute lyrics about “walking 
after dark” and “girls with 
broken hearts.” There are 
no musical curveballs here 
— just catchy, lovelorn 
rock songs.

One frustrating aspect 
of the album is the amount 
of raw potential squan-
dered on murky pit stops 
such as drowsy wanderer 
“Out of Tune” and the 
pleasant but lengthy guitar 

interlude “Indian Ocean,” 
which slow the exhilarating 
pace of some of the album’s 
more straightforward 
guitar-pop.

Still, it’s difficult to 
deny the alluring chemis-
try between multi-instru-
mentalists Amalie Brunn 
and Sean Kilfoyle. And, 
when they stick purely to 
tight, focused songwrit-
ing— grooving basslines 
pulsating beneath bone-
dry drums and rousing 
vocals — the duo find its 
niche: paying homage to 
their hair-gelled, pale-
skinned idols. 

“Cemetery Rain” and 
“Juniper” are blissful 
dream-pop gems, and the 
up-tempo “Funeral Song” 
has Kifoyle performing his 
finest Dylan impression 
as he laments, “So long, 
summertime/I’m not com-
ing back.” 

By The Hedge is an 
enjoyable glimpse at 
cloudy teenage angst — 
sometimes compromised 
by the pressure to pro-
duce marketable radio 
anthems — and, if noth-
ing else, a promising and 
occasionally memorable 
debut.

Brooklyn Duo Does Its Best ‘80s
Impression, Sans the Black Lipstick

T here’s something about laid-back guitar riffs and murky vocals that 
capture the essence of 
youth — a sentiment that 
New Jersey natives Real 
Estate have taken to heart. 
On their self-titled 2009 
debut, the band paired its 
hazy lo-fi aesthetic with 
beach-ready pop, crafting 
a record that’s the pinnacle 
of the Beach Boys-gone-
psychedelic trend of the 
moment (See: Panda Bear, 
Beach Fossils). 

Ducktails, the pet 
project of lead guitarist 
Matthew Mondanile, are 
little different. 

Arcade Dynamics is 
all  predictably jangly 
surf-pop, with a few 
experimental instrumental 
tracks sprinkled through-
out. 

Case in point: pre-
release single “Hamilton 
Road” contains much of 
the off-handed charm that 
made Real Estate’s debut so 
pleasant. Mondanile sets 
his fuzzy vocals — which 
describe a summer day 
relaxing in a tree house, 
accompanied by other 
childhood clichés — to 
meandering guitar lines. 
The result’s as catchy as it 
is subtle.

But for every delicately 
crafted gem, there’s a 
synth-heavy complement 
like “The Razor’s Edge,” a 
two-minute instrumental 
track unremarkable in its 
ambience. “Arcade Shift” 
and “Porch Projector” 
both follow in the same 
vein: pleasant at best, 
gratingly sluggish at 
worst. 

One of the album’s 
strongest tracks, the 
upbeat “Killin’ the Vibe” 
defines the Ducktails’ 
aesthetic. Over the multi-
tudinous guitar riffs pres-
ent throughout the album, 
Mondanile pleads that the 
listener “Don’t go killin’/
Killin’ the vibe.” 

It’s a pleasant little 
song, just like the record 
itself. But while Arcade 
Dynamics is definitely 
listenable, it doesn’t 
come close to the kind of 
detailed craftsmanship 
that characterizes similar 
works, like Real Estate’s 
debut or Julian Lynch’s 
Mare. Sure, Ducktails have 
plenty of good, throwback 
vibes — but unfortunately 
the tracks fade into the 
sunshine.

O ur gal Britney has come a long way since her “Oops I Did It Again” glory days. But even after a few kids in the oven, Britney isn’t doing so bad for herself; though sterile as ever, 
her last album Circus was an unabashed return to picture-perfect 
pop form. But for “Hold It Against Me,” the first single of her new 
album, Britney and producers Max Martin and Dr. Luke decide 
to hop on the wagon of the latest dance music trends, throwing 
together David Guetta-style Euro synths with a hint of — wait for 
it — dubstep, and it’s not exactly a winning combination.

 Britney’s voice sounds like her typical fembot self, but when 
layered upon a horribly asthmatic beat, the few charms of its artifi-
ciality are worn thin. The pop star’s voice is so banal that the lyrics 
are irrelevant, even when she’s spouting controversial innuendo (The 
Bellamy Brother claim the song’s lyric “If I said I want your body 
now, would you hold it against me?” comes from their 1978 hit).

‘H.A.M.’
Kanye West & Jay-Z
ROC-A-FELLA

A �er 2010’s chart-topper My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye’s much-anticipated collaboration with Jay-Z on Watch the �rone single “H.A.M” falls far short of the hype. 
“H.A.M.” opens to a scattered robotic beat that builds into a 

melodramatic and frantic crescendo of “O Fortuna” wailers.
Over the clamor, Kanye, followed by Jay-Z’s baritone, raps with 

uncommitted apathy, as the duo spits lack-luster rhymes that fall 
short of even MBDTF’s simple prose. It’s like a “who’s biggest” com-
petition of lyrical duds — with “this a new crack on a new stove” 
(Kanye) and “I swam waters with great whites” (Jay-Z). But the big-
gest lyrical o�ense is courtesy of the song’s title — possibly the worst 
acronym every birthed by the hip-hop genre — “H.A.M.,” which 
we’re supposed to believe stands for HardAsaMotherfucker.  Not 
that Yeezy cares (as usual). “I’m about to go HAM,” Kanye yells — 
go hog wild, you crazy motherfucker.

than a second over Grand Canyon. 
Langland would prove to be an all-

star performer the rest of the day. He 
won the 50 freestyle (21.40) and nar-
rowly won the 100 freestyle (47.55), 
touching the wall .04 seconds sooner 
than his closest opponent. As the 
anchor leg in the 200-yard freestyle 
relay, Langland jumped in a full body 
behind the anchor for GCU, but fin-
ished half a body length ahead.

“Individually, I was very pleased 
with Blake [Langland] today,” 
McGihon said. “After winning the two 
freestyle events, his anchor leg of the 
200-freestyle relay really capped off a 
great day for us. To come from behind 
like he did was really a good swim.”

Korth and junior Matt Herman 
also won two individual events for the 
Tritons. Herman recorded victories in 

the 500- and 1000-yard freestyle races, 
with times of 4:41.95 and 9:41.08, 
respectively. Korth recorded victories 
in the 100- and 200-yard breast stroke 
races, with times of 57.78 and 2:06.49.

The women also came up with 
some impressive performances 
along with Henley’s dominating day. 
Freshman Anji Shakya again proved 
herself to be a star in the making, as 
she won both the 100- and 200-yard 
backstroke events with times of 58.88 
and 2:08.03.

The women will travel to

Fencing Performs Well at West Invitational
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

FENCING — The UCSD fenc-
ing team found modest success 
last weekend, as the squad hosted 
the six-team West Invitational at 
RIMAC Arena. The Tritons racked 
up a 7-3 overall record competing 
against Northwestern, Stanford, 
Cal Tech, Florida and the Air Force 
Academy. 

“Overall it was a solid perfor-
mance,” head coach Heidi Runyan 
said. “It gave us a good idea where 
we are in our training and where 
we need to go.”

On the women’s side, 
Northwestern — one of the top 
programs in the nation — domi-
nated, going 5-0 and dropping only 
one match-up in the foil. 

The Wildcats opened by crush-
ing hosts UCSD 25-2, and went on 
to comfortably beat Florida, Air 

Force, Stanford and Cal Tech — by 
at least 11 match-ups each. 

The Triton women went 4-1 
overall, with their only loss to 
Northwestern. UCSD bounced 
back from its opening loss with two 
close 14-13 victories over Stanford 
and Air Force. The Tritons then 
pounded Cal Tech 23-4 before dis-
patching Florida 16-11. 

Captain Casey Gillcrist was 
instrumental in the Tritons’ vic-
tories, posting a 9-7 record on the 
day. Julia Wu also had a big day as 
she went undefeated against region-
al opponents. 

Wu posted 3-0 performances 
against Air Force and Stanford as 
well as Florida, and women’s sabre 
went 6-3 against Stanford to seal 
the win for the squad.

The men’s team went 3-2 
on the day, with wins against 
Northwestern — whose men’s team 
does not compete on the NCAA 

level — Cal Tech and Florida, 
and losses against Air Force and 
Stanford.

The foil squad led the way for 
the Tritons, with captain Michael 
Fong posting a 9-3 record and 
freshman Brennan Louie putting up 
a 10-2 mark. 

The Triton sabre squad also per-
formed well. 

“Freshmen Bryson Abilay and 
Nicholas Bartuzik are good addi-
tions to men’s sabre,” Runyan 
said. “I was impressed with their 
poise against some strong oppo-
nents.” 

Stanford went 5-0 to win on the 
men’s side.

The top Triton fencers will 
compete in the North American 
Cup from Jan. 14-17 in Dallas, 
Texas.

sibly their only real test during the 
regular season. 

This isn’t to say the Aztecs aren’t 
for real — they just haven’t proven 
themselves yet. It really isn’t their fault 
that they don’t play in the Big East, 
which has eight teams ranked in the 
top 25. So if you have the time, find 
a friend that wants to venture over 
to State with you and see one of the 
nation’s top-ranked basketball teams.

BCS Academics
Cam Newton and Auburn needed 

a last-second field goal, but they still 
came out on top of Oregon on Jan. 
10, 22-19. This handed a fifth-straight 
national championship to an SEC 
school, a maddening fact to anyone 
who lives west of the Mississippi and 
north of the Mason-Dixon line.

But more importantly, two schools 
with outstanding academic records 
won BCS bowls in Stanford and TCU. 

Both are small schools with high 
academic standards — Stanford obvi-
ously more so — and each was never-
theless able to end the season among 
the top five in the country.

It is often said that stringent aca-
demic standards cannot coexist with 
big-time collegiate athletics. This is 
one of the arguments used against 
UCSD moving to Division I, as some 
believe better sports would detract 
from our success in the classroom. 

Yes, there may be some players like 
Cal’s Marshawn Lynch — who boasts 
he’s from Oakland in pregame intro-
ductions rather than citing his alma 
matter — that skate through school, 
don’t earn a degree and get themselves 
into a professional league. But Stanford 
and TCU — each with football gradu-
ation rates over 70 percent — have 
proven that athletics do not necessarily 
compromise academics, and detractors 
should realize success is possible on 
and off the field.

A Little Too Familiar
Last year’s women’s basketball team was one 

of the hottest in the country — until it ran into 
Humboldt State. The squad lost just five times last 
season, but the Lumberjacks brought its confer-
ence and NCAA tournament runs to an abrupt 
end.  The 2009-10 women’s volleyball team lost just 
three times, but also had a short postseason run.

This year, the volleyball team started with high 
expectations, but found itself clawing just to make 
the postseason after an early-season five-game 
losing streak. The basketball team has started 4-7 
and 2-2 in conference, including another loss to 
Humboldt.  

This year’s volleyball team ended up with a 
successful season in part because it won 13 of the 
next 14 matches after the losing streak, and the 
basketball squad looks to be going down that same 
path with four straight wins going into Thursday’s 
matchup with Cal State L.A.

Slow starts appear to be a trend here at UCSD, 
with both the women’s and men’s soccer teams 
getting less-than-stellar results early in the season. 
So the women’s basketball team shouldn’t worry 
if they can turn it around like the volleyball team 
did, or, even better, like this year’s NCAA national 
runner-up women’s soccer team.

Don’t look now, but SDSU men’s basketball is 

18-0 and the sixth-ranked team in the country. 
Riverside native Kawhi Leonard is averaging nearly 
a double-double with 15.9 points and 9.6 rebounds 
per game, and the Aztecs are on the longest win-
ning streak in the program’s history.

But before we get too excited, there should be 
realistic expectations for the Aztecs. Their sched-
ule has been a relative cakewalk so far, with their 
only win over a ranked opponent coming on Nov. 
16 against then-No. 12 Gonzaga. The squad has 
played “tough” non-conference games against Cal 
Poly and Division III Occidental.  

While it might be going too far to say they are 
playing “the Little Sisters of the Poor,” a two-point 
win over IUPUI isn’t exactly convincing. (Just 
for clarification, that’s Indiana University, Purdue 
University, Indianapolis.) 

Their Mountain West Conference schedule isn’t 
terrifying, with Brigham Young the only ranked 
team. The Jan. 26 showdown with Jimmer Fredette 
and the Cougars will be the Aztecs’ first and pos-

TRITONS DOMINATE IN SWIM MEET AGAINST GRAND CANYON AND MESA STATE
By Tyler Nelson
Associate Sports Editor

The day after a narrow loss to rival Loyola Marymount University, the UCSD women’s swim team pulled 
out an outstanding performance on Sunday 
to beat Grand Canyon University and Mesa 
State by scores of 175-87 and 220-40. The 
men’s swim team also beat both GCU and 
Mesa State by scores of 184-74 and 217-39, 
respectively. 

It was the first time the men’s squad 
was competing in the pool since the Arena 
Invitational in Long Beach back on Nov. 
20, but the Tritons showed no signs of rust 
as they picked up right where they left off. 
The women’s team had lost the day before to 
LMU by a 132-130 decision, but picked up 
the pace and blew its opponents out of the 
water.

“I thought our women had a great oppor-
tunity to bounce back from a disappointing 
day yesterday and they did just that,” head 
coach Scott McGihon said. “We didn’t per-

form up to our capabilities against LMU but 
I felt we did today. The team had very good 
focus across the board and it showed in the 
results.”

After claiming three victories against 
LMU, junior captain Alex Henley picked up 
another two victories, winning the 200-yard 
freestyle with a time of 1:55.55 and the 200-
yard butterfly with a time of 2:06.64. She 
swam in different events in the two days and 
showed her versatility, delivering two second-
place finishes and five first-place finishes in 
the two-day stretch, counting relays.

The women’s team got the meet off to a 
fast start, winning the 200-yard medley relay 
and setting a tone for the rest of the day. 
Freshman Anji Shakya, sophomore Michelle 
McCadden, senior Jessica Ferguson and 
senior captain Anju Shimura posted a time of 
1:49.18. The men’s team jumped in next, with 
freshmen Martin Vanek and Nick Korth, 
sophomore Adam Yen, and junior Blake 
Langland posting 1:35.53, winning by less
