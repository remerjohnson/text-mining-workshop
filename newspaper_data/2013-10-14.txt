UCSD health and maintenance 
workers will hold a vote between Oct. 
28 and Oct. 30 to determine whether 
they will go on strike for the second 
time this year over low wages and 
increased pension premiums. 

Service workers represented by the 
American Federation of State, County, 
and Municipal Employees 3299 have 
been negotiating a new contract with 
the UC system since it expired in 
September 2012. 

The healthcare workers’ contract 
expired in January 2013.

AFSCME represents over 22,000 

workers across UC campuses and 
medical centers, including patient care 
workers, maintenance workers and 
other technical workers. 

The union previously went 
on strike in May after giving the 
university a 10-day notice to transfer or 
accommodate their patients. 

The strike lasted two days and 
cost the UC system an estimated $20 
million.

The workers most recently staged 
a demonstration outside of UCSD’s 
administrative complex while banging 
pots and pans, citing concerns over the 
UC system’s push for pension reform.

The administration’s proposed 
changes to benefits include an increase 
in mandatory employee pension 
contributions from 5 percent to 6.5 
percent and administration pension 
contributions from 10 percent to 12 
percent.

UC President Janet 
Napolitano Makes 
First UCSD Visit

Graduate and undergraduate student 
leaders met with Napolitano to voice 

concerns and discuss upcoming plans.

UC President Janet Napolitano met with over 20 undergraduate and graduate student leaders from UCSD at a working lunch held in the Mandell Weiss 
Forum on Thursday, Oct. 10. Napolitano — who succeeded 
former UC President Mark G. Yudof on Sept. 30 — is touring 
all 10 UC campuses and visited UCSD as her second stop on 
her 11th day in office.

Notable attendees included Graduate Student Association 
President Rahul S. Kapadia, and UC Student Regent-Designate 
Sadia Saifuddin. Additionally, UC Provost Aimée Dorr also 
joined the meeting.

Interim Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Alan Houston 
asked participants to come prepared with a question for 
Napolitano, but the conversation shifted to when Napolitano 
expressed interest in giving participants the rare opportunity to 
directly voice their concerns to her.

Associate Vice Chancellor Steps Down
"3"$*1%3'''"22"%0.

A search committee will be launched to replace Jeanne Ferrante, who will leave 
her position on Nov. 1 to resume her duties as a professor of computer science.

UCSD Associate Vice Chancellor 
for Faculty Equity Jeanne Ferrante 
announced this week that she will 
step down on Nov. 1, after serving 
in the position for five years under 
the newly created Office of Vice 
Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and 
Inclusion. 

Ferrante joined UCSD as a 
professor of computer science in 
1994, becoming the department 
chair in 1996. Since then, Ferrante 
has become a Fellow of Association 
for Computing Machinery and a 
Fellow of the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronic Engineers. In 
2006, she received the ACM 
SIGPLAN Programming Languages 
Achievement Award for her work in 
Static Single Assignment form.

As AVC for Faculty Equity, 
Professor Ferrante created 
the first core group of Faculty 
Equity Advisors to foster faculty 
department diversity and began 
multiple initiatives aimed at gender 
equity and women’s leadership.

Ferrante was also involved 
in starting faculty orientation 
programs and creating a UCSD-
hosted round-table discussion 
regarding equity and diversity in 
academics and hiring practices. The 
discussion is slated to take place 
later this month.

“Professor Ferrante has played a 
leading role in advancing [UCSD]’s 
goal of achieving and sustaining 
faculty equity and diversity in 
pursuit of academic excellence,” 
Executive Vice Chancellor Suresh 
Subramani and Vice Chancellor 
for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
Linda S. Greene said in a campus 

release. “She has been integral in 
our efforts to recruit, retain and 
support faculty with demonstrated 
diversity experience and those who 
are willing to make substantial 
contributions in advancing diversity, 
equity and inclusion.”

Following a sabbatical, Ferrante 
will resume her position as professor 
in the UCSD department of 
computer science and engineering.

“It is clear that her work has had 
meaningful impact, for which we 
are deeply grateful,” Subramani and 
Greene said in the release.

The Office of the Vice Chancellor 
for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
will begin a campuswide search 
for a new AVC for Faculty Equity 
following the creation of a search 
committee in the near future.

▶ Hazmat Team Wins Best in 
County: UCSD’s Hazardous 
Materials Response Team won first 
place in the county at the annual 
County of San Diego Department of 
Environmental Health’s Hazardous 
Materials Division “Hazcat” compe-
tition last week. The team competed 
against groups such as the San Diego 
Fire-Rescue Department and Marine 
Corps Base Camp Pendleton to iden-
tify unknown, hazardous chemicals.

“Our team did an outstanding 
job in the Hazcat,” UCSD Director 
of Environment, Healthy and Safety 
Department Garry MacPherson 
said. “All the teams were extremely 
competitive and represent some of 
the county’s brightest minds when 
it comes to responding to hazardous 
materials incidents.”

▶ Governor Signs Domestic 
Violence Bill: Gov. Jerry Brown 
signed Senate Bill 400 last Friday, 
protecting domestic violence victims 
from discrimination or grounds for 
termination in the workplace. The 
bill, spearheaded by San Diego private 

school teacher Carrie Charlesworth, 
was introduced after Charlesworth 
was fired due to a domestic violence 
situation.

“It’s incredibly gratifying to know 
that because SB 400 has been signed 
into law, thousands of domestic 
violence victims won’t have to 
experience what I did,” Charlesworth 
said to NBC San Diego. “By signing 
SB 400, the governor is helping 
victims better their lives without the 
fear of losing their financial security.”

▶ National Engineering Forum: 
UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla 
teamed up with the National 
Engineering Forum  last week to 
host an event discussing engineering 
leadership in the San Diego region 
and UCSD’s continuing engineering 
advancements.

“[UCSD] was proud to host 
this event and have a leadership 
role in this national discussion 
on how we can advance America’s 
interests through engineering,” 
Khosla said. “Universities play an 
important role in addressing the 

National Engineering Forum’s 
3C’s — the capacity, capability and 
competitiveness of our engineering 
workforce.”

▶ Professor Receives Million-
Dollar Grant: Distinguished UCSD 
professor of ophthalmology Robert 
N. Weinreb received a $6.4 million 
grant from the National Eye Institute 
last week, as part of a five-year study 
on the genetics of glaucoma in 
African-Americans.

Using the grant, Weinreb and the 
rest of his team hope to understand 
and identify glaucoma genes to 
create new drug therapies for the 
debilitating optic disease.

“A better understanding of the 
relationship among the stage of 
disease, the rate of change, ancestry 
and other important risk factors 
being tracked in the ongoing African 
Descent and Glaucoma Study will 
allow us to evaluate the relationship 
between genetics, visual loss and 
structural damage in this high-risk 
group,” co-investigator and fellow 
professor Linda Zangwill said.

CORRECTION
In the October 10 issue of the 
Guardian, an article about A.S. 
Council transportation change 
incorrectly stated that part of 
the campaign name was “Let’s

AFSCME President Kathryn 
Lybarger believes that the university’s 
actions amount to illegal intimidation.

“In attacking the collective 
bargaining rights of the biggest union 
in the UC system, UC administrators 
are betting that they can intimidate 
others who would challenge their 
reckless priorities into submission,” 
Lybarger said. “This is not just 
un-American, it is a full frontal 
assault on the students, patients and 

California taxpayers that this system 
is supposed to serve. Californians will 
not be bullied.”

In a press release from the UC 
Newsroom, Vice President for 
Systemwide Human Resources 
Dwaine B. Duckett stated that the 
UC system is issuing its last proposal 
to the union after months of 
disagreement.

“We invited AFSCME back to 
the bargaining table on Sept. 18 to 
try to resolve differences. However, 
despite our best efforts, the two sides 

were not able to reach agreement 
on a mutually acceptable approach 
to pension reform,” Duckett said. 
“Having completed all stages of the 
bargaining process, including state-
assisted mediation and fact finding, 
the university is legally entitled to 
implement its last proposal.”

AFSCME’s last strike was 
approved by 97 percent of union 
members who voted.

The former Arizona governor and 
former U.S. secretary of Homeland 
Security asked attendees what they 
would do if they were the newly elected 
UC President, which led to an hour 
and a half discussion. Participants 
discussed issues such as campus 
climate, concerns for marginalized 
student populations and a lack of 
funding for niche departments, such 
as theater and the Scripps Institution 

of Oceanography. 
The UC Police Department 

provided heavy security for the event 
due to the anticipated presence of 
protesters from the “NapolitaNO” 
campaign against Napolitano, whose 
appointment has been the center of 
political controversy among UC 
students. The event location was kept 
confidential, and no protesters were 
seen at the event site.

 Saifuddin also visited the UCSD 
campus on Thursday, speaking about 

upcoming plans for the year.
“It’s an interesting year, especially 

because we have new leadership,” 
Saifuddin said. “[The regents] said that 
diversity is really important to them, 
and now it’s time to put their money 
where their mouth is.”

Guilt By 
Association 
Gets You 
Out of  Bed

When the young and naive me first learned how to use my phone’s alarm 
clock, I was overjoyed. Instead of 
beeping obnoxiously, the system 
would serenade me with my favorite 
jams. It only took two weeks, though, 
for my happiness to be shattered; I 
started hating my most beloved songs.

For a couple of mornings, I wore 
a self-satisfied grin as I trundled out 
of bed to silence the cheerful music 
blaring in my room. But it wasn’t long 
before my body decided that it didn’t 
in fact wish to rouse itself from that 
perfect warm spot in my bed, even 
with John Lennon’s strident voice 
echoing off the walls. My natural 
instinct to hate waking up started to 
take precedence, and before I knew it, 
I was growling vicious death threats 
at my alarm tunes. These ill-tempered 
sentiments were sadly not confined 
to the morning; every time afterward 
that I heard “Good Day Sunshine” I 
would wrinkle my nose in irritation 
and skip it. I had in effect inadvertent-
ly trained myself to associate that par-
ticular song with the most disagree-
able experience of being woken up.

This veritable tragedy is one of the 
effects of conditioning, the learning 
process by which we develop subcon-
scious reactions to various stimuli. 
Famed Russian physiologist Ivan 
Pavlov, the star of high school psy-
chology class lectures, first illustrated 
the phenomenon in 1901 with the 
help of several canine subjects. Dogs 
were repeatedly presented with fra-
grant food while a bell was being rung 
in the background. In the first few 
trials, they would salivate in anticipa-
tion every time they saw the food. Yet 
the dogs gradually realized that every 
time the bell rang, food would arrive. 
As a result, in later trials the bell could 
be rung without the food also being 
presented, and the dog would start 
salivating as if it were expecting the 
dish to come with the sound.

This associative behavior, sans sali-
vation, is very common. An important 
aspect of the conditioning process is 
that it is intended as a survival mecha-
nism of sorts to help steer us away 
from danger and toward food and 
shelter. If a certain piece of sushi, for 
example, makes you violently ill, you 
will pointedly avoid eating more of 
the same in the future to prevent more 
mishaps. Additionally, you may cringe 
every time you so much as walk near 
The Bistro. Interestingly, some forms 
of conditioning are not solely elicited 
by biological stimuli like sickness; 
you may find yourself uncomfortable 
in Solis Hall because you once had a 
dreadful math midterm there.

However, there’s a bright side. It 
just so happens that we can manipu-
late those hated alarms to make our 
days a little better if we use them spar-
ingly. For example, a unique song can 
be reserved for especially early morn-
ings to galvanize your slumbering self 
into action. Although you may end 
up with a strong dislike of its opening 
chords, your body will associate the 
song with especially early wakeups 
and will be more likely to get out of 
bed feeling refreshed and ready.

Although this might motivate you 
to start your day off with your Top 
10 playlist, be wary. If you happen to 
hurl your phone across the room in 
a sleep-deprived rage to silence the 
alarm, you’ll only have your favorite 
songs to blame.

A popular method of attracting students to the world of science involves show-ing off very loud and visually appealing 
experiments. From the elementary to the high 
school level, we still rely on teachers dropping 
potassium into water for its bright, colorful 
explosion and crushing aluminum cans using 
the magic of air pressure. Efforts to drive the 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Math 
fields involve rudimentary examples of “fun” 
science that completely insulate pupils from 
the real world work that they might do in their 
careers. They start off with very crude under-
standings of what being in their major means, as 
if they expect to dissolve solids in acid or launch 
cannonballs for a living. According to a 2010 
UCLA study, 40 percent of engineering and sci-
ence majors and 60 percent of pre-med majors 
end up changing their minds or dropping alto-
gether, likely due to this very misconception. 
Growing up with a poor grasp of what these 
STEM careers are causes incoming freshmen to 
choose majors that may not really suit them.

The whole purpose of these pseudo-experi-
ments is to engage budding minds and get them 
interested in STEM in an attempt to raise the 
next generation of engineers, chemists and doc-

tors. For the most part, this is actually working. 
Take UCSD for example: The most impacted 
majors are found in the Jacobs School of 
Engineering, specifically within the aerospace, 
bioengineering, bioengineering/biotechnology, 
mechanical and computer engineering depart-
ments. The U.S. Department of Education has 
also noted that the engineering and engineering 
technologies field has increased 21 percent from 
1999–2010. 

However, having some context going into 
the field is what will actually keep these stu-
dents interested. According to Oscar Porter, 
director of the UC academic development 
program Mathematics, Engineering and Science 
Achievement, “Getting students engaged in 
their career path early on through internships 
and lab time is essential to student retention [in 
STEM majors].” Hands-on experiences are what 
solidify interest, creating a permanent and tan-
gible connection to ideas. Professors can discuss 
engineering concepts and proper code structure 
all they want, but what is most valuable is when 
the student sees their knowledge applied, pro-
viding proof that they know what they are doing 
no matter what their grade may be.

A clear goal is also necessary to stay on 

track in the STEM field, an area riddled with 
extremely difficult and unfortunately specific 
coursework. Intelligent as Tritons are, not 
everybody will be prepared for that class on 
fluid dynamics or software engineering once 
they start engaging in major specific courses. 
And when it’s 3 a.m. on test day, many may 
start to question why they do what they chose 
to do. But upon this epiphanic hour, when 
students realize their major isn’t for them and 
they’ve changed their mind, it may be too late. 
By junior year, or upon completion of 90 units, 
UCSD students are expected to declare a major 
despite their prior classes only dealing with 
general education requirements. And now, 
those with a shakily chosen major no longer 
have the option or money to switch. Many are 
stuck unexpectedly finishing — just barely mind 
you — a degree that does not even apply to their 
aspirations anymore. These are very bright indi-
viduals who were not prepared for the course 
load ahead of them. And without a career goal 
in mind, many choose to give up altogether.

It would help students if high schools 
helped facilitate understanding of the fields

:#;7(''4"(%< POPULAR ONLINE DATING WEBSITE OKCUPID.COM HAS INTRODUCED A CONTROVERSIAL NEW FEATURE THAT ALLOWS USERS TO PAY TO FILTER OUT CERTAIN BODY TYPES FROM THEIR SEARCH RESULTS.

By encouraging users to sort through potential dates by body types 
and attractiveness ratings, popular dating website OkCupid fosters 
deception and a sad shallowness all at once.

Considering many people have some physical insecurity, 
OkCupid’s new filter will undoubtedly damage self-esteems that 
are already low while simultaneously promoting dishonesty. 
Research by Dove found that as girls age, their self-confidence 
decreases with heightened pressure to be visually pleasing. 
According to their findings, only 4 percent of women around the 
world believe themselves to be beautiful. 

With most people being their own worst critics, it is not surpris-
ing that many online daters feel the need to embellish their perceived 
image. A study conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
and Cornell University found that a staggering 80 percent of the 
online dating world is dishonest when it comes to weight, age and 
height. OkCupid’s new image filtration system adds extra incentive for 
men and women to portray themselves with misleading profile pic-
tures and inaccurate information.

While it holds true that people may choose whether or not to 
acknowledge certain people based on their looks, they cannot make 
them disappear from real life settings. But with the mere click of a but-
ton, thousands of OkCupid members instantly disappear from a user’s 
search. This is both highly damaging to a person’s sense of self-worth 
and unrepresentative of reality. 

American culture has become obsessed with image, heavily 
emphasizing it in the dating world while often overlooking other 
qualities necessary for a successful relationship. OkCupid perpetuates 
this superficial practice and leaves many without the opportunity to 
see what lies beneath someone’s exterior.

Choosing Potential Partners Based on Physical  
Features Is a Natural Part of  Dating

Appearance-Based Filter Increases User  
Dishonesty and Superficial Judgment

Society dictates that we try to look past others’ appearances, but 
what appeals to us is still defined by biology. OkCupid’s new body-type 
filter simply capitalizes on the very process humans have been using 
for millions of years.

In a 2006 LiveScience article summarizing findings on how 
humans pick mates, University of Texas psychologist Devendra 
Singh explained that body type conveys information about health 
and fertility — information we are evolutionarily adapted to appre-
ciate.  A woman’s waist-to-hip ratio, for example, subconsciously 
tells males all sorts of nice tidbits about her capacity to reproduce 
and care for her children, while broad shoulders in men indicate 
their ability to protect mates and offspring. Body type is not just 
a trivial preference; it is an important factor in selecting potential 
mates from those that might be duds. 

Although social convention usually denounces judging others 
based on looks as unacceptably superficial, it is something we humans 
do very naturally and subconsciously. Try as we might to consider 
personality, what we see dominates our opinions of people. A 1966 
study from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology by Elaine 
Walster, Vera Aronson, Darcy Abrahams and Leon Rottman on the 
“Importance of Physical Attractiveness in Dating Behavior” confirmed 
“the largest determinant of how much [a man] wanted to date the part-
ner again … was simply how attractive the partner was.” 

Dismissing such a dominant part of our evolutionary makeup is 
unrealistic. Similar to the selections in the bar scene, part of the dating 
process will inevitably include picking and choosing the individuals 
that one is most attracted to. You can filter potential dates yourself, 
but if you choose to pay for this option, OkCupid’s CEO Sam Yagan 
explains succinctly: The filter will simply “save everyone some time.”

STEM Needs Strong Roots

Students need mentorship, guidance and real-world experience before 
pursuing majors in STEM fields.

=>'?+1+5''@/6'''

students are interested in. While not 
everybody entering into the STEM 
field needs to know what exact job 
they want with which specific com-
pany, it is necessary for students 
to have some context before they 
choose to dedicate four years to one 
field. Entering freshmen need real 
world examples to help them stay 
focused; searching on the Internet a 
few days before college apps are due 
does not constitute sufficient reason 
to enter into any field.

The solution to this lack of infor-
mation is forgoing the superficial 
experiments in science once we reach 
the high school level in favor of more 
personal assistance. A survey by 

Canadian research company Ipsos 
Reid found that 64 percent of stu-
dents in secondary school wish they 
had a mentor in their lives for career 
advice. High schools need a pro-
gram similar to UCSD’s Mentorship 
Program where students are paired 
with an appropriate faculty member 
for career guidance. 

Many students don’t have the 
advantage of knowing a family mem-
ber or being inherently connected to 
the field they’re interested in. Having 
a mentor helps point students in the 
right direction, informing them of 
the many opportunities they may not 
have noticed before. This would likely 
alleviate many of the pressures associ-
ated with applying to universities, as 
well as lead to a much more reassur-

ing start in college.
While our time here at UCSD 

is certainly meant to explore and 
discover ourselves, time restraints 
require that we start with some 
direction. And in order to find the 
right “general” direction, a better 
connection to the field is necessary, 
whether that be through a personal 
mentor or a program that connects 
with companies and showcases 
the field to students. If we are to 
develop the next generation of sci-
entists and engineers, then we need 
to show these potential candidates 
what it means to work and be proud 
of their job in the STEM field.

humans.  Our study is aimed at understanding and improving the whooping cough 
vaccine and we are looking for healthy volunteers, between the ages of 18 and 65 

that may have recovered from whooping cough or lived with someone that was 
diagnosed with whooping cough and are willing to make blood donation(s). 
Qualified participants will be asked to provide information regarding their 
vaccination history and will be provided compensation for donating blood.

I n today’s competitive job market, the road to employment can be tricky to maneuver. Each step — from the resume to the first day in the office — requires thorough preparation and keen attention to detail. Fear not! Students can turn to the UCSD Career Services Center for some extra help and networking opportunities. This 
Wednesday, Oct. 16, students will be able to engage with employment recruiters at the “Triton Fall Science and 
Technology Job and Internship Fair.” The event will take place from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on Library Walk, 
where over 130 companies in the science and technology fields, such as Apple, Amazon and Boeing, will have 
booths set up along the daunting path to Geisel Library. To help students make the most out of the fair and 
increase their job prospects, the Guardian asked Career Adviser Kathleen Self for some tips on how to approach 
potential employers and make a great first impression.

Keep your resume to one page, unless you have extensive related 
experience.

Organize headings so that the most important points are first.

Keep the formatting clean with sufficient margins, uncluttered copy and 
an easy-to-read classic font.

Proof, proof again and then give it to a friend to proof.

BEFORE THE FAIR
Find out which companies will be there. (Check 
out the company list at career.ucsd.edu.)

Research the companies (i.e. browse the com-
pany websites or visit Port Triton to view what 
jobs they have to offer). A quick Google search 
won’t hurt, either.

Collect information on the specific needs of the 
company. Use this information to make your 
resume and talking points relevant. Market 
yourself appropriately.

Pick the top 10 internships or jobs you are 
interested in, and plan to talk to their respective 
recruiters. Also have a list of “maybes,” in case 
you have extra time.

AT THE FAIR 
Have more copies of your resume on hand than you think you’ll need.

When you introduce yourself, include what you’re studying and your
accomplishments, and talk about what the company needs.

Ask questions that demonstrate interest in the company. Learn and repeat 
the recruiters’ names in conversation, but don’t overdo it.

Keep track of other opportunities to learn about the internships and
companies. Bring a pen and small notebook for notes.

See if the companies you are interested in hold informational sessions. 
These sessions are vital, because they will give you a chance to learn 
about the company and the jobs they have to offer. 

Be prepared for a potential short-notice interview. Some of the companies 
will offer on-campus interviews for their jobs. These employers have a 
strong need for certain students, and they are willing to go a long way to 
find them. They are on the lookout for people to interview soon.

Research the company, and review the job 
description prior to the interview.

Identify your top five skills and experiences that 
are relevant to the position.

Complete a practice/mock interview prior to the 
actual interview. Get your suitemate to help!

Bring additional copies of your resume and 
references to the interview.

Arrive 10 to 15 minutes before the interview, 
turn off your cell phone and go alone.

Be specific, and provide examples in your
responses. This adds credibility to statements 
you make about your qualifications.

Come prepared with two to three questions to 
ask about the position at the end of the inter-
view. 

Collect business cards of the individual(s) who 
interviewed you. 

Always send a handwritten thank-you note to 
the interviewer(s) within 24 hours of the inter-
view. It’s old-fashioned, but it is effective.

PETRA CRUZ AND THE SEXUAL AND RACIAL 
MODALITIES OF PROPERTY RELATIONS –
PC WEST, THURGOOD MARSHALL RM
Professor Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez (UT Austin) will 
deliver a talk entitled: 'Petra Santa Cruz Stevens and 
the Sexual and Racial Modalities of Property Relations 
in the Nineteenth Century Arizona-Sonora Borderlands.' 
By analyzing the unsuccessful murder-suicide attempt 
by ex Congressman Hiram Stevens which failed to kill 
his wife Petra Santa Cruz Stevens on March 23, 1893, 
Dr. Guidotti-Hernandez stages a series of interventions: 
a reassessment of borderlands history as it is currently 
practiced, the ways in which material objects account 
for the affective and social labor of producing legible 
subjects and a feminist critique of social history and 
national formation that shifts our attention to how 
Borderlands negotiations of violence consolidated the 
U.S. nation-state as a whole.

division courses, ANAR 158 'The Inca' and a new 
course, tentatively titled ANAR 159, 'Coexistence and 
Crusade: Origins of the Spanish Conquest'. This new

understanding the late Medieval and early Imperial 
periods, with students writing in reaction to excursions 
to major monuments in the context of readings and 
lectures.

COMPANY—MANDEVILLE AUDITORIUM
From the internationally acclaimed Sydney Dance 
Company comes an exuberant, high-octane fusion of 
dance, sound, language, and light. Artistic Director Rafael 
Bonachla's '2 One Another' is a vivid study of human 
relationships that simultaneously explodes with unbridled 
energy and softens into contemplative gestures. 
Performed by sixteen dancers who possess a distinct 
blend of suppleness, strength, sensuality, and verve, the 
work charts the myriad of actions and reactions, and 
connections and disconnections that make up a life. Set 
against a pulsing, pixelated backdrop with a driving, 
baroque-meets-electronica soundtrack, '2 One Another' is 
an exuberant celebration of movement from a company at 
the height of its powers. Regular $28-$46/Subscriber 
$24-$39/UCSD Student $12.

JUNIP WITH BARBAROSSA—THE LOFT
Formed in 1998 in Sweden, Junip has taken its time in 
releasing its first album in 2010, due in large part to Jose 
Gonzalez's success as a solo artist. Sprawling away from 
the stark folk aesthetic of Gonzalez's solo efforts, Junip 
teems with driving motorik rhythms, psychedelic 
atmosphere, and dense synth textures. Despite its 
differences to Jose's solo work, Junip's powerful 
instrumental interplay reveals itself throughout and with 
nimble players to react to, Gonzalez's picking is carried in 
raggedly virtuosic sublimity. Doors open at 8.
Show starts at 9.

share a love for honest original music and vibrant live 
performances. Cherub's music is a fresh electrified 
take on risque pop music that brings to mind timeless 
artists such as Prince or Zapp and Roger, and more 
contemporary artists like Pharrell and The Dream. With 
a live show that is bouncing with energy, Cherub 
dances their way into the hearts of audiences from the 
first falsetto hook, until the very last delay filters out. 
Catch them at The Loft this Fall!

freestyle.
Some of the younger team 

members also had some incredible 
and exciting races during the event. 
Sophomore Paul Li managed to 
break records in three individual 
races, and freshman Jaimie Bryan 
had a big day, as he managed to 
break the record for the 150 breast-
stroke — one of the oldest intact 
records at the school that was previ-

ously held by eight-time NCAA 
champion Rosanna Delurgio.

Coach Corrie Falcon said she 
was pleased by her team’s perfor-
mance at the event and that the 
team is anxious to go improve their 
!nish at NCAAs from last year. 

"e Tritons placed seventh on 
the men’s side and third on the 
women’s side the previous year. She 
has high hopes for her team this 
year though.

“With 17 new records achieved, 

we are con!dent we are on track 
to have one of our best years ever,” 
Falcon said.

Next up, the team has an alumni 
meet during the UCSD Homecom-
ing on Oct. 19 at 9 a.m. "e Tritons 
open their 2013–14 season a week 
later on Saturday Oct. 26 at 12 p.m., 
hosting Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at

from the Tritons at 20–20 a#er com-
mitting too many errors. 

In the fourth set, "e Tritons 
woke up and ended the match by set-
ting an aggressive tone from the start 
and putting pressure on the Pioneer 
defense with a strong service game. 

"e Tritons were victorious with 
an impressive 25–10 win. 

Even though this game looked 
easy on paper, Luyties explained 
that every team in the conference is 
good.

“I’m very happy we won this 
game,” Luyties said. “"ere were a 
lot of long rallies and good defense 
on both sides. Some of the balls I 
thought hit the $oor, but they dug 
them up. "is was a really fun game 
to watch defensively.” 

On Saturday evening, UCSD was 
back at it again against Cal State 
Monterey Bay. "is match was no 
easy breeze and turned out to be a 
!ve-set thriller. "e teams alternated 
wins during the !rst four sets, but 
the Tritons swept the Otters o% the 
court, winning 15–9 in the !#h. 

“"ere were a lot of ups and 
downs,” Luyties said. “Both teams 
were playing really good defense. We 
struggled with getting good swings 

that killed the ball. Five sets was 
not what I wanted. Again, we played 
close games and let them slip away 
in the end. We get a good lead, but 
then we give away a bunch of points. 
We have to work on that and get bet-
ter.”

Sophomore Danielle Dahle led 
the team with 29 kills and 33 digs for 
the weekend. 

Friday, Dahle was named MVP of 
the Reis Cup. Junior Sara McCutchan 
also had a spectacular weekend with 
22 kills and 10 blocks. 

Senior libero Brittany Lombardi 
led all players with an impressive 51 
digs for the weekend. 

A#er nine matches so far in con-
ference, the Tritons !nd themselves 
in third place. 

“Our goal is to win the confer-
ence,” Luyties said. “To do that, we 
have to win the rest of the games and 
also get some help from other teams. 
Overall we are in a pretty good spot, 
but we it will de!nitely be tough.” 

Next Friday, the Tritons play Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on the road 
and host Cal State Los Angeles at 
RIMAC Arena this Saturday, Oct. 
19.

beginning, laying claim to eight out 
of the top nine spots. Course record 
holder and conference champion Isaac 
Chavez led the Chico pack through 
the !rst mile in 4:51 and through the 
second mile in 5:08. UCSD wasn’t far 
behind, maintaining six of the top 20 
spots by the second mile. UCSD run-
ners Kellen Levy and Scott Acton stuck 
by the Chico pack, staying in the top 
10 through the third and fourth miles.

At the !nish, Chico runners Al-
fonso Cisneros, Johnny Sanchez and 
Isaac Chavez all purposefully tied for 
!rst place, posting a time of 25:40.8. 
Chico !nished with the top !ve posi-
tions, scoring as low as they could with 
15 points. 

Acton !nished !rst for the Tri-
tons and seventh overall with a time 
of 26:05.6, while Chico !nished !ve 
points ahead of UCSD, 55–50. 

Garcia said the Triton Classic will 
serve as a good primer for UCSD’s next 

meet — the CCAA Championships -- 
in two weeks, where UCSD will face 
both Cal Poly Pomona and Chico State.

“Last year, the men !nished third 
and the women !nished fourth, and 
we’re looking to improve on that this 
season,” Garcia said.

Defending champions Chico State 
will host the CCAA Championships 
Oct. 26.

Men’s and women’s cross country 
places second at Triton Classic.

A!er seven straight games on the 
road, fans "ooded RIMAC Arena 
for last weekend’s matches against 
Cal State East Bay and Cal State 

Monterey Bay. #e No. 11 nationally 
ranked UCSD women’s volleyball 
team won both matches to take its 
sixth straight win. 

“I’m really satis$ed with the girls’ 
e%ort this weekend,” UCSD head 
coach Ricci Luyties said. “#e thing 
about this team is that no matter 
what the situation is, they try hard 
on every point, so as a coach you 
can’t be upset about that.”

On Friday night UCSD played 
Cal State East Bay in the $rst annual 
Reis Cup, a game played in remem-

brance of former UCSD volleyball 
player Karen Reis who was tragically 
killed last year in a murder suicide.

A!er what looked like a nervous 
start from both teams, the match 
soon heated up with impressive digs 
and rallies from both sides. How-
ever, the Tritons showed patience at 
the end of the $rst two sets, forcing 
the Pioneers to make mistakes. 

UCSD won the $rst two sets 25–
22, 25–22. #e third set slipped away

UCSD Begins Season 
with Blue vs. Gold Meet

SWIMMING  AND  DIVING

The UCSD Swim and Dive team break 17 school 
records to start the 2013-2014 season at annual meet.

T he UCSD men’s and women’s cross country teams both placed second overall at the 21st An-
nual Triton Classic, last Saturday, Oct. 
12.

Beginning at RIMAC $eld, wind-
ing through the canyon and ending at 
the Triton Track and Field stadium, 
both teams placed second out of eight 
teams, behind 2012 CCAA Champi-
ons Chico State on both sides. 

On the women’s side, UCSD soph-
omore Marie Diaz — the team’s top-
$nisher — led the Triton pack right 
out of the gates. Diaz was closely fol-
lowed by runners from Cal Poly Po-
mona and Chico State. #e women 
passed the $rst mile marker in 5:48. As 
mile two came by, Chico had claimed 
the $rst spot and had eight runners in 
the leading 20, but Marie Diaz and the 
Tritons were right on Chico’s heels. 

“We were really happy with how 
the women performed,” UCSD head 
coach Nate Garcia said. “We knew 
they were capable and they really put 
everything together for this meet. Of 
course we wish we were on the other 
side of that two-point swing, but we’re 
happy to see some good individual 

performances.”
Chico State senior Ayla Granados 

led the race coming onto the track, 
ahead of teammate Sara Mikesell by 
24 seconds. Ayla $nished $rst with a 
time of 22:06.8, and Mikesell $nished 
second with a time of 22:30.1, coming 
in less than $ve seconds a!er Mikesell 
was Marie Diaz. Triton runners Chan-
dler Colquitt, Michelle LeRoux and 
Paige Hughes $nished sixth, seventh 
and eighth respectively. 

#ough the Tritons had more run-
ners in the top pack, Chico’s $rst and 
second $nish was enough for them to 
edge out the Tritons by two points, 
coming in $rst place and beating the 
Tritons 35–33.

#e sun broke through the clouds 
as the men took to the starting line af-
ter the women’s race. #e UCSD men’s 
squad, ranked No. 17 nationally, had 
won the Triton Classic back-to-back 
in 2011 and 2012 but were thwarted 
by CCAA rivals No. 5 Chico State and 
No. 19 Cal Poly Pomona.

Chico State — the 2012 conference 
champion — was dominant from the

#e annual inter-squad Blue vs. 
Gold event between the UCSD men’s 
and women’s swimming and diving 
teams kicked o% the 2013 season 
last Saturday at Canyonview Pool. 
#e Blue squad — featuring UCSD 
standouts Alex Merrill and Anji 
Shakya — came out on top against 
the Gold squad, which featured 
national champions Nicholas Korth 
and Lindsay Oosterhouse, 311–246.

On the men’s side, the Gold team 
won 143–129 while on the women’s 
side, the Blue team won 169—99. 

UCSD head coach Corrie Falcon 
was excited for the annual event, 
which serves as a primer for the 
season ahead.

“[It’s a] fun event that serves as 
a dress rehearsal for our dual meet 
season,” Falcon said. “It gives the 
team an idea of where they are at and 
gets them excited about competing.”

#e teams were selected by 
captains Merrill and Shakya — who 
headed the Blue squad — and Korth 
and Oosterhouse for the Gold team. 
Korth and Shakya, who served as 
team captains in 2012, are also for-

mer national champions. Korth was 
the 2011 NCAA Division II national 
champion in the men’s 200 breast as 
a freshman and Shakya is the current 
national champion in the women’s 
200 freestyle.

During the meet, the Tritons 
broke 17 new school records. Korth 
managed to lower his own 150 
breast record by over four seconds 
while at the same time managing to 
win in three separate events: the 50 
breaststroke, 150 breaststroke, and 
the 50 butter"y. #is Blue vs. Gold 
meet was the second successive year 
that he has managed to win the same 
three events.

Shakya also managed to win 
in three individual events: the 200 
freestyle, 150 backstroke, and 400 
freestyle. She also managed to lower 
her own 200 freestyle record by 
almost three seconds to 1:51.

Merill managed to break his own 
record in the 200 freestyle and also 
beat the four-year-old record in the 
100 free. Merrill repeated his perfor-
mance from last year by winning in 
the both the 100 freestyle and 200
