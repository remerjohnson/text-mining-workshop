Faculty Discusses Division II Issue UCB Approves 
Pub Renovation By Sheryl Wolcott SWfWriter 

In possible contradiction to 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson's 
assenion last week that the fac-
ulty will "vigorously" protest a 
possible move from Division 
ill to Division II for UCSD's 
inrercollegialeathletic program. 
only a small number of faculty 
and staff members attended 
yesterday's Intercollegiate and 
Recreational Athletics Advi-
sory Committee (lRAAC) fo-
rum that centered on the issue. 

The purpose of the fonun 
was to allow the faculty and 
staff to express opinions on the 
future of the UCSD intercol-
legiate athletic program. About 
30 faculty and staff members 
dotted Warren Lecture Hall 
200 1, which was also occupied 
by approximately 20 tudents, 
including members of both the 
men's basketball team and the 
Associated Students. 

This faculty and taff forum 
follows a student-focused fo-
rum held a week ago in the 
continuing effort by IRAAC to 
extract popular opinion regard-
ing the current and future status 
of the intercollegiate athJetic 
program. IRAAC will draft a 
recommendation, which it 
hopes to submit to Vice Chan-

-cellorofUndergraduateAffairs 
Joseph Watson by the end of 
the year. 

"If there were no problems 
with our Division ill affilia-
tion, we would not be having 
this talk right now," Athletic 
DirectorJudithSweetsaid.She 

Dean of Arts and Humanities Stanley Chodorow -
"What kind of Division /I institution do we want to be?" 

defined UCSO's current prob-
lems in being a member of Di-
vision m as "geographical lo-
cation. size, public affiliation, 
and not being in a conference." 

Sweet explained that most 
Division ill schools are located 
in the East and Midwest, and 
that UCSD is one of only 12 
Division ill schools in Califor-
nia 

She also pointed out that 

UCSD has an undergraduate 
population which ranks in the 
top 10 of all Division III 
schools, and that the growing 
enrollment is slated to reach 
26,000 by the 2005. 

In addition, UCSD is one 
of only three Division ill pub-
lic universities in California. 
One of those, Cal State San 
Bernardino, moves to Division

A.S. money to aid GSA 
in funding new venture 
By Rachel Blackburn 
Staff Writer 

By a 7-0-1 vote. a motion to renovate the 
Triton Pub was passed by the University 
Center Board (UCB) Monday. 

TIle motion amends earlier pub renova-
tion plans to include the revised Graduate 
S'· ·::(;nt Association (GSA) proposal for a 
smaller pub pace and to end the plan to 
architect for rendering into blueprint and 
co t estimates for the project. 

According to UCB Vice Chair Paul 
Eykamp.lhe next step will be forthe board to 
get both a plan and cost estimates for the 
project before approving or amending the 
plan. 

Future financial problem with the reno-
vation include unexpected costs and addi-
tional co ts if the university insi ts on heat 
and ventilation in tallalions. According 10 
University Center Director Jim Carruthers. 
the pub will be lucky to break even. Still. the 
overwhelming con. ensus of the board was 
that the propo al should be approved. 

According to UCB Chairman Nick Long. 
the biggest concern that must be considered 
is that the prop<> aI is a ervice for students 
initialed by students. 

"If we make plans and then can' t get the 
money we'll at least have the blueprints to fall 
back on to make it work," Long said. "We 
have a reasonable plan, and despite the unex-
pected costs [of heat and ventilation installa-
tion] ... we should go ahead and start plan-
ning and see where it goes. We have to take 
the first step."

New ISIS System Brings Big Fee and T-Reg Changes 
• Integrated system will combine all university-related fees on one invoice 
By Kerry Hall 
Staff Writer 

Yesterday marked both the be-
ginning of the telephone registra-
tion period for Spring Quarter 1991 
classes and the implementation of a 
new computer system. The new 
system will both drastically change 
that registration system and make 
the processing of student infonna-
tion at UCSD more efficient. 

TIle new computer system - the 
Integrated Student Information 
System (ISIS)-combines various 
student services such as registra-
tion, financial aid, housing, and stu-
dent billing, and coordinates 
UCSD's telephone registration (T-
REG)syslem. 

The program will store all stu-
dent information on one database, 
and will print it out on one invoice. 

"We've gotten all of the student 
user organizations together and c0-
ordinated our efforts," Assistant 
Registrar Sally Hickok said "This 
is a tocally integrated system which 
also includes a student billing sys-
tem. This is the fll'St time we've had 
astudent billing system on our cam-
pus, and we're really excited about 
it" 

According to UCSD Bursar 

Howard Fisher, enrollment, regis-
tration, academic records, billing, 
housing, and financial aid will now 
be combined into one system. 

"It all goes into one database 
bucket," Fisher explained. "infor-
mation I have will be shareable. 
Based on the need to know . .. one 
can extrapolate this infonnation." 

Beginning March I, registration 
invoices will be mailed to all stu-
dents. 

To register, all the student has to 
do ismakeout a check forthe amount 
on the invoice and either mail or 
drop it off at the Central Cashier's 
Office. 

In a concept the Bursar's Office 
has named "One-Stop Shopping," 
the invoice will remind the student 
of all money they owe the univer-
sity, from housing fees to library 
fines. In the past, students hav,: had 
to pay their various campus bills 
separately. 

Forstudents on fmancial aid,ISIS 
will automatically apply their aid 
toward registration fees, and stu-
dents will be registered automati-
cally. 

If the amount of financial aid is 
in excess of the sum of university 
registration and miscellaneous bills, 

Kolaetl Guardian 
UCSD Bursar Howard Fisher helps oversee the new ISIS system. 
the student will be able to pick up 
checks at the Bursar's Office. How-
ever, if financial aid recipients de-
cide not to return to school, they 
must return the top pan of their 
invoice with the back filled out indi-
cating that they will not return. 
Failure to do so will result in auto-
matic registration, and "F' grades 
may result 

Currently, the automatic payment 
for those with financial aid does not 
include those with guaranteed stu-

dent loans because such loan pro-
grams are run through private banks. 

Invoices will be mailed in a 
weekly sequence, determined by the 
student's registration time. Students 
can enroll after March 22 at the 
Central Cashier's Office and will 
receive an on-line student invoice at 
that time.

rolled tudents who have paid their

weeks before the payment stickers 
were ready during previous years. 

Administrators hopclhclong line 
in front of the ticker distribution 
lenl behind the Central Cashier's 
Office will be eliminated by the 
new system. 

"The guiding principle behind 
the planning for the system was to 
do away with lines." Hickok said 

1beBursar'sOfficcplans 10 have 
adequate staff memben available 
in order to erLWltI a hassle-free dis-, 
tribulioo of stickers. according 10 
Fisher. 

Because of ISIS. the format of 
T-REG has been changed. Rather 
than using their eighl-4igit student 
J.D. number. students will use their 

social security number to identify 
themselves when logging inlo lhe 
system. 

To selecl courses. students will 
use a six.-<ligit section l.D. number 
instead of the four-digit code used 
previously. In addition, each com-
ponent of the class (i.e., lectures. 
sections, and labs) must beenroUed 
separately. A course code will be 
entered for each instruction type. 

T-REG wiD check undergradu-
lie students' previous coursework 
to see if all prercquisitecourses have 
been passed. 

Also new is the opportunity pr0-
vided by ISIS to lisl all available 
sections for a class if a panicular 
section in which a student wishes to 
enroU is filled. 

"One of tbe besI new fearures is 
the availability to hear a list of open 
sections." Assistant Registrar Myra 
Wcbbsaid 

Courses can now be added and

dropped. and the pas -no pass grad-
ing option can be changed using T-
REG. A chan in the front of the 
schedule of classes show the times 
and restrictions. 

The system also checks for time 
conflicts among classes. and warns 
the student iftwo regi tered classes 
take place at the same time. 

If there are department tamp 
requirements for courses in which 
students wi h to enroll, that 
department's office wiD have ac-
cess to ISIS-linked enrollment 
screens. and wiD be able to simply 
ovenide the class restriction for 
students. 

In March, students living on-
campus will find their housing 
charges listed on their invoices.

• Untted States needs to find ways 
to reduce its dependence for oil 
By o..g DbIan. AaIOdall ~ EdIrx 

As American troops fight in Iraq. many people in 
America are now calq for III energy policy which will 
free us from the grip of foreign oil ThaI eaersY policy is 
now seen as the miracle cure for American addic:tioo 10 
fomp oil. While this is a great idea. America mUll be 

~ that such a policy is one based in n:ality and not high-
minded idealism. 

An energy policy is a must for the United Statea. In 
1989 President Bush set out to draft a coherent energy 
policy for the 19905. After nearly two years of effon. this 
policy has still not been put into place. or even been 
clearly stated. 

The Bush administration has found that domestic 
energy interest groups have no intention of letting any 
energy policy go into effect which docs DOl protect their 
profitability. and they have spent a great deal of money 
purchasing the favors of congressmen (Democrat and 
Republican) to do their bidding. 

The latest proposal for an enel"lY policy, which is now 
surfacing in Congress. is based on the idea of freeing 
America from foreign oil by increasing domestic 011 
output and by engaging in some token effon to reduce 
consumption. This is the wrong policy for America. 

America must not free itself from foreign oil. it must 
free itself from all oil. The policy which America should 
pursue must be based on freedom from petroleum by the 
year 2020. This dale is sufficieody far in the futun: for 
technological and political factors to allow the elimina-
tion of 011 production dependence. 

America's energy policy must begin by implementing 
ahemate energy production within the next four years. 
There arc two types of alternative energy which are 
technologically and economically feasible today, and 
which can provide relief from oil in the short lenn. 

The fmt is nuclear power. Nuclear power has under-
gone some marvelous advances in recent years. making it 
safer and cleaner than ever. The advent of reactors whicb 
can use spent fuel from existing reactors bas greatly 
reduced the amount of waste which must be disposed of. 
Safety advances which weft! made aftu the Three Mile 
Island incident have also made nuclear power much safer

I've aever liked George Bush. 
1bcn was always IOIIlIIIbiDa about the little weasel thai I just 

couldn'tllUSL I couldn't pur my f'inacr0ll it, though-maybe it was 
theladyeyesorlbalcrookcdsmDe. Ormaybe it was just that be was 
a rich, white, Texa oil mao. 

No. dial wasn't it. 
Even wben the war started, 1 couIdn't figure It out. I mean, sure. 

his obvious undyinJ love for war wu obsc:ene, but I fipnd be was 
just your typic:al RepubIic:ao bucard who go« off on seeins other 
people die. But no, Ihere w .. still somed1ing else there. 

I f'IIItJOl suspicious back ioAupt. Tbe troops aot over 10 Saudi 
Anbia.1iIIIe tooquickJy,. JiUIe too blalamly. Looking back now, 
it's obvious. 

Bush's plan all aIoa& was 10 have them wait Iberc a long time, in 
ORIcrtobuiJd up public support backbome. All tbosepoor, innocent 
soldiers, locked up for an etemity in Ibcir hostile desc:rt purgatory. 
trJI8ically sepanlIcd from their anxious loved ones halfway around 
the world. Who wouldn't sympathize with thai? 

And just when the public was about to either lose interest or get 
so frusII3rcd that they would tum on him, Bush popped the January 
1 S ultimatum. There it was - the hook. was baited. 

Bush knew Saddam would never back out of Kuwait if he had a 
deadline. That would have been political suicide. 

I doubt thai he fooled anyone with that "new world order" crap. 
That's the same tired excuse we've been hearing since World War 
I-which was "The Warto End Wars."Warsdoo·tcreate peace any 
more than taking "one Jut hit" helps a junlcie get off the needle. 

And the "Free Kuwait" shit didn'a fly. either. True, I guess itcould 
be Bush's twisted logic that, liko the soo or so civilians we admil to 
ki11ing in Panama. if the people of Kuwait are dead, • least they're 
not W1der SlIddam's ~ve thumb. 

Thcso were all slimy. u&ly lies, intcoded 10 hide the vile sameness 
that BUlb and Saddam abare: bocb oftbcse bastards are in it for the 
JIoIy. 1 .... for some people, power is more important than 
people', Jive.. but frMkJy tbat maIrIII me puke. . 

Soil WIID't surprising tbat one of the first taIpts inBqbdad was 
their maiD TV ceoICr. This, of COUJIC, wu bombed to "cut off 
cornmuaications between Sad&m and his troops" -I guess be had 
been pIIaoIna to inIcrt secDt coded messages into renms of Ibc 
"Beverly HiDbillies." So it WII just an unfortuDate coincidence that

in his own ego to reali.zc the gigantic PR blunder he was making. 
And so. whether by design or not, the only views of the war 

American audiences got were shots of citizens of Tel Aviv 
mourning Scud damage. Sure, the bombing of Israel is disgust-
ing. but their loss is minimal compared to that of the Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti civilians. who had no more voice in this war than the 
Israelis. But instead of Alab suffering. we get the Pentagon's 
saniti2led version of the war overlraq - "Top Gun"-like scenes 
of "good guy" American pilots celebrating another "successful" 
bombing run over Bapdad. 

How convenienl.lt sw-e would suck if we had to see the people 
we're killing. And then came the clincber: the oil spill. 

Fordays. CNN. anempting to fill 24 hours of news space with 
something more than the cver-excitlng footage of jets taking off, 
bad been parading their fBscioaling collection of Middle East 
"experts" around the studio. &$king them to predict Saddam's 
next move. "Well, he could dwnp all that oil into the gulf and set 
it on fire," one said. And then (whaddya know?) there was 
Saddam. pumping mi1lions of ga1100s of crude straight into the 
salt water (Saddam warchea CNN). 

Oneday passed. The spill was growing. Bush. appearing very 
shoc:ted, issued a stem but exttemely sincere statement, warning 
Saddamthatlhis "environmental terrorism" was a pretty dam bad 
thing 10 do. 

AnoIherday passed. Still later. after sitting on their carriers for 
days while the water around them turned black, allied jets 
suddenly zipped over to the supply valves, bombed them into 
oblivion, then cruised back home, the flow shut off. 

Why the heD didn't we do something earlier? Good question, 
one thai even my devout hawk roommate was asking. 

Saddam Hussein has been broadcasting his moves days before 
he makes them. And even if we badn 't seen itcoming,it's not like 
we didn't know about it when it did stan. With all the "military 
inlelligence" we have over there, somebody had to have a con-
tingency plan for dealing with something like that ... i~ 's n~t like 
there's no oil overtheJe. At the very least, even the gemuses m the 
Pemason should have figured something out in less than a 
weekend. 

So when I saw a cartoon in the LA. Ti~s, it all became clear. 
TItefirst panel showed along-haired protestor toting a "No Blood 
for Oil" sign. 1be rJe1tl showed the same protestor. now holding 
an oil-soaked bird and a "Nuke Saddam" sign. 

Then it hit me. Bush bad been milking this oil spill for every 
dropofpublK:opinionbecould get. No wonder it took so long to 
stop. Saddam Hussein had unwittingly turned the Persian Gulf 
inroa political goldminc for George Bush. Black gold, Texas tea. 

AD Bush had to do to squash theanti-warmovement- which, 
up to thar point had been heavily populated by Sierra Qub. 
etlviJonmentalist types - was to sit on his bands for a couple of 
days.publiclyappcarrealconcemcdaboutallthosepoordefense-
_ bUds and aeaIs Ihat terrorist madman was killing. and the

Wbich be did. And in die meantime, the sinister bastard was

Bush in '88 were slitting their own

And you know Bush is sitting in

there's the resurrection of the witch-

era - "If you don't support the

What's really scary is that in

don't seem to realize that they'n:

behalf of the faction for the pur-
chase of tenn is balls before the chair 
could even ask him to do so. 

"Third college needs tennis balls. 
It seems clear that tennis balls are of 
great use for recreation, and no point 
need be mentioned further on that 
note.

Third College. By the purchase of 
eight tennis balls, Third College 
srudents, and it is the students that 
make this coUege what it is, will 
have an identity to associate them-
sel ves with. Thatidentily is the tennis 
ball. For the bouncing ability of the 
tennis ball alone is an attribute which 
every Third College student will 
undoubtedly strive to emulate and 
achieve. And with this achievement, 
the students of Third College will 
no longer feel like just a number.

rhetoric and their pants, and have 
their penises measured -the whole 
world would have seen thar neither 
baslard had one. 

Even so, there is stiU one big 
thing that separates these sinister 
slugs. Boch are desperately plotting 
to grab some Machiavellian 
stranglehold on world power- but 
George Bush's plans are working. 

And that's what scares me most. 
Looking back at what he's done to 
get where he is - especially COfl.. 
sidering he needed public support to 
get thete-what the hell is he going 
to do with all this power once he 
finally gets it? 

When that happens, it will be us, 
not the people of Iraq or Panama, 
who will be standing in the way of 
his whims. 

So for all you neo-knee-jerk "pa-
triots" out there, remember this: 
Sure, there's a war going on, but 
!hat's no reason to start kissing your 
government's ass. 

That's exactly what they want 
you to do. 

They will believe in themselves, 
and bounce to greater heights than 
they ever imagined. For the love of 
the students that you represent, 
please vote in favor of purchasing 
eight tennis balls." 

After the speech, there was a 
motion to vote on the issue. (t was 
immediately seconded. 

"Okay," said the chairperson, "all 
in favor of purchasing eight tennis 
ba11s?" 

Seven hands were raised. 
"AJJ opposed?" 
Again, seven hands went up. 
A dead tie. 
As the realization that the issue 

was deadlocked swept through the 
room, angry glares were exchanged, 
then tears began to fall, and finally, 
an all-out, relentless screaming 
match commenced. 

To this day, the issue is brought 
up at every council meeting, only to 
remain unresolved again and again 
and again and again .

asked is 'what kind of Division D 
institution do we want to be?" 
Chodorow suggested that a philoso-
phy and guidelines be drawn up for 
the future status of the athletic de-
partment. 

Another facully member agreed, 
saying, "if it is inevitable that this 
[move to Division m will happen, it 
is imponant to find the beSt road 
toward it." 

The discussion then turned to talk 
about special admissions of athletes, 
the issuing of athletic scholarships, 
and funding. With Division II 
standing, a school is allowed to grant 
a limited amount of scholarships. 

Reactions were rnixed on the value 
of scholarships or fmancial aid for 
athletes. While some of the audience 

The UCSD Guardian 

spoke out against scholarships, oth-
ers justified scholarships and fman-
cia! aid, as long as it is need-based. 

"We would be less than enthusias-
tic if we were put in a situation if we 
were competing against schools who 
did give out scholarships, and we 
[did] not," Sweet said, expressing the 
views of the athletic department. 

The faculty expressed concern that 
the quality of students would sufferif 
the school adopted a policy of accept-
ing cenain students on the basis of 
their athletic ability. 

"AJJ athletes oUght to be qualified 
to enter the university," Chodorow 
said. "Special admit students should 
not be allowed to play ball here -
they are not smart enough to give up 
the time it requires to play. I know, 
because I was one." 

10 light of the state budgetary situ-
ation which will leave the UC system 
sorely lacking funds, a clear concem

• A hopeless romantic's guide to 
darning your date on Valentine's Day 
By Mon a....m.n, GUllldlIIII Reportflf 

I f you have a girlfriend, boyfriend, or lust-object-from-afar, you must know that it's Valentine's Day. But today doesn't have to be just another day. Accordin8 to some students, lobster, champagne, or even iridescent confetti can make the 
evening a memorable one. 

Since eating is necessary for survival, many lovebirds choose to 
go out to dinner. Muir senior Ric Lawson described a creative feast 
that he once planned for his girlfriend. 

.. , told her that I was taking berto an elegant restaurant But after 
, pic:ked her up. , drove her to my house," he explained. '" 
transformed the diniRa room into a restaurant. I bought live lobster 
and a bottle of wine for dinner, and my roommates, dressed in coats 
and ties, posed II hosts, waiters. and even as bartenders. I also had 
a friend perfonn a pitar serenade. Unfortunately, the damn stove 
broke, and we are out anyway." 

Lawson's subsequent Valentine's Day experiences improved. 
"1be next year, my girlfriend purchased tickets on Invader 

CI1IiIea, "Lawson explained. "We had a great Mahi Mahi dinner on 
bcwd, plus there wu an open bet, dancing. and entertainment .. 

According to Lawson, one way to give the evening an added

twi t is to rent a limousine forthe drive todinner. "It's a lot of money 
to spend if you want the limo for Ihe whole night , but if you renl it 
for just a couple of hours, it's not that expensive," he said. 

Dominic Andrada, a Revelle senior, is planning a traditional 
Valentine's date. 

"I'm going to give her flowers and a hearl-shaped box of candy. 
Then, I'm going to take her to the Marine Room," he aid. 

The Marine Room is an ocean-front dining spot near La 10lla 
Shores. 

"The view of the cove is terrific, and you can walk around the 
cliffs before or after dinner," Andrada said, adding that after dinner, 
he anticipates sipping champagne from the cenic heights of Torrey 
Pines State Park. 

An inexpensive dinnel can provide as much romance as a night 
on the town. One student suggested either buying take-out food, or 
preparing a meal at home, then driving to a scenic spot, . uch as 
Balboa Park, Mt Soledad, or even the balcony of a building at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. While a blanket will do for a 
tablecloth, there is no need to be simple. A friend could be enlisted 
to set up a romantic table for two. 

There is, however, more to Valentine's Day than dinner. Third 
College junior Carli Kim suggested making it an all-day event. 

"One of the best [times] I had was when [my boyfriend] drove 
here last night," said Kim, who is involved in a long-distance 
relationship. "We stayed in bed until noon, then we grabbed some 
bread. some fruit, and a blanket, and went to Balboa Park, where we 
spent the day watching people and sleeping under a tree." 

Warren sophomore Felicia Caiazzo described how she once 
made a Valentine's Day memorable for her boyfriend. 

"He was very picky about his apartment being clean," she said. 
but "while he was out, I taped hundreds of paper hearts to all his 
walls, scattered iridescent confetti in the shape ofXs and Os on the 
floor, and used thick, red lipstick to draw a big heart and the words 
'I Love You' on his bathroom mirror." 

A Third College junior, who requested anonymity, described a 
date that held surprise as the key element. 

"I told her that we were just going to see a movie. 1 didn't have 
a car at the time, so she had to pick me up. Because she thought we 
were going to the movies, she was dressed in a casual jeans outfit. 
But when she came to my door,. was dressed in a coat and tie," he 
said. "While she was trying to figure out if she was under dressed or 
iff was overdressed,l revealed that we were going to a play. I then 
presented her [with) a black evening gown that I had kidnapped 
from her room, We went to the theater in style." 

Another anonymous student plans to do away with going out on 
a date altogether. After her last class today, she will drive to her 
boyfriend's place in Los Angeles, dressed in an overcoat.. . and 
black lingerie. 

Valentine's Day doesn't have to be boring, or expensive. And an 
overcoat wouldn't hun.

KISS: Spots to smooch in San Diego 
ContInued from .-.8 
of La 1011a Cove, it's easy to un-
derstand why this area has been 
likened to the French Riviera. 
There is an abundance of fasci -
nating reefs, caves, and tidepools 
to explore. The view from these 
vantage points is unrivaled," Brada 
said. 

Another La Jolla beach Brada 
uggested is Wind and Sea. which 
he did not rate, but she com-

mented, ·'This is right out of the 
love cene in ' From Here to Eter-
nity.' Don ' t be surprised if you get 
an irresistible urge to grab your 
loved one and run along the sand 
hand-in-hand, only to fall into the 
urf in a pas ionate embrace. 

" I was so in awe that nature 
could create something so beauti-
ful. It overlooks the ocean and i a 
wonderful to place enjoy the beauty 
of nature," he aid about Torrey 
Pines State Reserve, ranking the 
spot with four kisses. 

Brada al so gave the Top 0' the 
Cove restaurant four kisses. 

According to Brada, "If table 
number six could talk, you would 
hear torie of eternal devotion 
and passionate proposals whis-
pered between savory, mouth-
watering courses." 

Sunset Cliffs in Ocean Beach 
provides another ideal location for 
lips to meet. 

"With nothing but sparkling 
water on all sides, you will feel as 
though you ' re sitting on the edge 
of the world. In amazement you 
will watch as the sky explodes into 
brilliant color, creating a giant 
golden paint stroke across the ice-
blue ocean," he said. 

"With nothing but 
sparkling water on all 
sides, you will feel as 
though you're Sitting 
on the edge of the 
world." 

- Deborah Brada 
Greater San Diego contains a 

wide variety of romantic spots, 
including Balboa Park, which was 
ranked with four kisses. 

" [It) is a romantic adventure 
waiting to happen," Brada said. 

"It's perfect to walk along holding 
hands through pan of the 1,400 
acres of lush tropical greenery 
here." 

While Brada did not rate 
Coronado, she described it as "a 
wonderful romantic getaway. 
There' s something so exciting 
about getting into the ferry, hold-
ing hands, the wind blowing in 
your hair, and watching the water 
sparkle. The peninsula itself is just 
adorable." 

The Britt House, and Corvette 
Diner are two San Diego restau-
rants Brada enjoys, but she ranked 
them completely differently. The 
fonner, a moderately priced res-
taurant which Brada gave four 
kisses, "has a special place in my 
heart. My husband proposed to me 
here, in this Victorian bed and 

breakfast. When I saw the room, 
with the chocolate kisses at the 
bedside and the teddy bear in the 
rocking chair, [cried. That's when 
he dropped to his knees and pro-
posed tome," 

The Corvette Diner, with a 'SO's 
ambience, rated one-and-a-half 
stars, 

"You can nin over meatloaf 
and hold hands to Elvis crooning 
in the background. The only way 
to describe this euphoric atmo-
sphere is to say it's funandcomy," 
Brada said about this inexpensive 
restaurant. 

These are just a few of the many 
places in San Diego to lock lips. 
Whether you spend the day stroll-
ing along the shore or dining out, 
Valentine's Day isn't complete 
without a kiss.

Winning is Nothing 
New to the Lakers 
T HERE ARE A FEW TRENDS IN pro basketball that you can count on every year. 

Michael Jordan averaging 30+ 
points per game is one. The 
Clippers and the Kings burrowed 
deep into the basement of the 
Western Conference is another. 
But there is perhaps nothing -
nothing - more traditional than 
the year in and year out domi-
nance of the Los Angeles Lakers. 

You know, it was really kind 
of funny the way people were 
declaring an "end" to the Laker 
dynasty when they went into a 
veritable tailspin in the early part 
of the season. 

Did the Lakers pay any 
attention to these people? 

Probably not. They were just 
wanning up. Either that, or tbey 
wanted to see how much of a 
challenge they could create for 
themselves to climb back into 
the race. As it was, a huge task 
lay ahead of them. 

T HE PORTLAND Trail Blazers were off to one 
of the best starts in basketball 
history - and with a current 4().. 
9 record and an .816 winning 
percentage, they still hold the 
upper hand on the rest of the 
professional ranks. 

But where are the struggling, 
pitiful Lakers? Where is the sad, 
sorry team that was "through" all 
the way back in October? What 
happened to them? 

Nothing new, really. Nothing 
at all. I mean, they're only three-
and-a-half games behind the 
Blazers. They've only got a .750 
winning percentage. And until 
Tuesday night. they had only 
won 16 games in a row. That's 
all. Big dtal. It's just the regular 
stuff. 

H EY, LOOK! Is that A.C. Green with 15 rebounds? 
Could that be James Worthy 
with 30 points? Is that ... could 
it be ... Magic Johnson with 
another triple double? [ thought [ 
saw that box score in yesterday's 
paper. And in the one from the 
day before. And the day before 
that. And two years before that. 

There's really nothing new 
here. 1be Lakers may not have 
what it takes this year to match 
up with the Blazers. But they'll 
give it their best shot - and you 
can be sure nobody will take 
them lightly. At least not this 
year. 

Or next year. 
Or the year after that. 
And., well., . you get the idea.

Tritons Bury Poets 88 ·70 
• Men's hoop looks sharp in 
win over Whittier; record 
winning streak reaches 12 
By Ken Perlman 
Staff Writer 

There's not a whole lot you can ayaboutthe 
UCSD men's basketball force ... uh, team. With 
the way the Tritons have been playing lately , 
it's easy to get confused. 

To put it literally, the Whittier College Poets 
were decimated by UCSD Tuesday night, 88-
70. 

and number one in the west, ended the game 
before it actually began. 

"The game was no contest afterthe firs t fi ve 
minutes," UCSD Head Coach Tom Marshall 
said. 

Before the Poets could get past their first 
stanza, UCSD had opened up a 10-2 lead and 
was showing no signs of letting up. 

By halftime, the lead had stretched to 49-30. 
"We really played well as a unit," Marshall 

aid. "We came out sharp and ready to play." 
The Tritons were just as sharp in tlte econd 

period, as their quick passing and execution off 
the fast break let them glide easily past Whitt ier 
for their 20th win of the season. 

Guerdlan File Photo 
Tim Rspp led the Tritons with 27 points, 
including five of seven three-pointers. 

The Poet were the most recent in a long line 
of victims to fall to the Tritons, as UCSD 
notched its 12th consecutive victory and ex-
tended the longest winning streak in UCSD 
men's basketball history. 

The Tritons, now ranked fifth in Divi ion III

seven shots from three-point range to lead 
UCSD with 27 points on the evening.

Leopards Fall, but 
Tritons Suffer the Bite 
• Graybill angry over 
sloppy play in men's 
volleyball victory 
By Joel Kurzman 
Staff Writer 

It is not unusual for the UCSD 
men's volleyball team to have to 
match its opponents' skill level to 
remain competitive in a match. 

With a schedule full of power-
ful Division I schools, the Tritons 
usually have to play up to its op-

ponents' level. 
But Tuesday night 's victory 

over the University of La Verne 
Leopards was an ugly example of 
allowing the other (eam 10 set the 
pace, as the Tritons' play sunk to 
the level of an inferior opponent. 

A small crowd and an angry 
head coach, Oscar ·'Digger" 
Graybill , looked on as the Tritons 
won, 15-2, 12-15, 15-10, 15-4.

Lam Takes His Lumps 
• Late-blooming 
sophomore overcomes 
inexperience to start 
By Joel Kurzman 
Staff Writer 

We all know of star high school 
athletes who enter college with 
great credentials only to find 
themselves riding the pine or in the 
stands. But have you ever heard of 
someone sl31ting for the first time 
at the major college level? 

Sophomore Lamson Lam's en-
thusiasm and powerful hitting have 
made him a leading fi gure on the 
UCSD men 's volleyball team, de-
spite his seemingly unglamorous

They're on a Mission, From Janel 
• Softball retums 
eight starters from 
22-16 team 
By HuIher Holtze ... 
Auociate Sports EtItor 

Here's the profile: 
• Thirteen returning players, 

eight of whom started last year. 
• A new coach -the newest 

in a revolving door of coaches 
- who stresses fundamentals 
and buics. 

• A team which finished 22-
16 last year, and missed out on 
the playoffs. 

And here' s the big picture: 
A band of bat-wielding 

women with revenge on theirminds 
are heading to the plate with vi-
sions of regaining the regional 
playoff berth denied them last 
season. 

"Everyone would like to play in 

the national championship, but a 
realistic goal would be to make 
regionals," ftrst-year UCSD soft-
ball Head Coach Melissa Janel 
said "Regionals will be the hard-
est obstacle we face. II 

Janel said that she is empha-
sizing the basics in the Tritons' 
early practices, 

"I'm a very fundamental type 
of coach, " Jarrelexplained. "Basics 
and fundamentals are where suc-
cess is, so that 's what I stress. 

"Everyone should understand 
why we're doing something and 
be able to do it," she said. 

The team's primary strength 
currently lies in its strong defense 
and the team's chemistry, accord-
ing to Jarrel. 

"Defense has always been em-
phasized," Jarrel said in reference 
to UCSD's previous coaches. "We 
have so much experience on the 
field."

mandy denied that his team's 
sloppy play was caused by his lib-
eral use of reserves. 

"I wouldn't call them second-
string," Graybill said after the 
match. 

"Maybe second-night, but not 
second-string." 

The second game of the match 
wasespccially irritating to Graybill 
as the Tritons jumped ahead 7-3 
following an easy 15-2 opener. 

But sloppy play, such as errant 
spikes and miscommunication, 
plagued the UCSO squad. 

La Verne capitalized on 
UCSO's inconsistency, taking the 

• 

lead and eventually winning 15-
12. 

The Tritons, led by Lawrence 
Werner, turned it around in the 
third game, winning 15-10 on the 
strength of several blocks. 

The Tritons outblocked the 
Leopards 21-7 on the nighl, with 
Werner adding four solo blocks 
and six assists. 

The Tritons breezed through the 
founh and final game, 15-4, again 
with frequent lineup changes. 

Allhough Graybill was dis-
pleased with the play of both his 
starters and reserves, he admitted, 
"there were spun of good play 
[from both)." 

He made note of junior Brent 
Couture's playoff the bench. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Couture's nine kills on the evening 
was second only to Gerry 
Goldstein's 14. 

Goldstein' 5 offensive showing 
was instrumental in counteracting 
the effects of Lamson Lam's de-
creased playing time due to a re-
cent ankle injury. 

Lam saw limited action - and 
played tenatively while he was in 
the garne-but Goldstein appeared 
10 have picked up the slack, most 
visibly in the third game. 

Goldstein ripped a devastating 
spike from the backcoun with the 
score 6-5 that appeared to lift the 
Tritons out of their doldrums, after 
the Leopards had made a brief run 
at the Tritons. 

La Verne's play was not im-

pressive, making ucsO's sloppy 
showing even more noticeable. 

The Leopards committed net 
violations and struggled to return 
serve, but they stayed ali ve and 
remained in the game because of 
UCSD's inability to capitalize on 
La Verne errors. 

"The only positive thing I can 
say about tonight is that we won," 
Graybill said. 

According to Graybill, the Tri-
tons lacked "high-level play" 
Tuesday night. 

Part of GraybiU's disappoint-
ment can be attributed to the Tri-
tons having important conference 
games Friday and Saturday against 
Menlo and Santa Clara, respec-
tively.

Rapp and Chris Moore pounded 
the boards for seven apiece. 

Defensively, Tuesday night's 
game was no different from what 
the Tritons have been doing all 
year, as UCSD held Whittier to a 
frigid 36 percent from the floor. 

DarvinJackson led the way with 
four steals, and Gordon McNeill 
added five blocked shots on the. 
evening. 

Corey Hoffert led Whittier with 
23 points. 

"Defensively, we took them out

LAM 
ContInued from pege 11 
in the nation. 

Despite his hometown's en-
thusiasm for volleyball, Lam 
played only occasionally with 
friends on a backyard court, and 
this "picnic-ball" was far from 
competitive. 

In fact, he saw the game as a 
mere pastime until three years into 
high school, when he faced the 
possibility of nolStarting his senior 
year. 

Volleyball became a passion 
during the summer before his fourth 
year, and has been ever since. 

"It became a year-round thing," 
Lam said. 

With a regiment of weight 
training, sand running and jumping, 
and beach volleyball. Lam im-
proved tremendously but fell short 
ofstaning. 

The summer's effort was not 
wasted, however, as Lam turned 
heads with his solid play for the 
prestigious Kamalii Manaloa club 
team. 

Kamalii carne in ninth nation-
ally at the Junior Olympic tourna-
ment that year and fifth the fol-
lowing surnrner. 

The tourneys, though, took 
place too late for college scouts to 
take notice of his talents. 

Lam, however, believes he 
wou1dn'thave been givenachance 
at a big-name volleyball school, 
since his play at that time was 

Lam is by no means di~

be key figures in 1991, larrel said. 

According to Jarrel, Harnack is 
probably the Tritons' best a11-
around athlete. 

Jarrel also noted that she ex-
peeted strong perfonnances from 
pitcher Dianna Moreno and short-
stop Dana Chaiken. . 

"Our strength is ... everybody' s 
played with each other for three or 
four years," Jarrel said. "We have 
the nucleus of the team returning 
from last year ...

Tbunday, February 1.,1991 

"I came for the education and 
liked [the fact] that I could play 
right away," he said. 

In his first year, he saw limited 
playing time as a play set hitter. 

Having to hit from the backcowt 
(beyond the IO-foo line),he found 
that he had to work on a broad 
jump instead of a vertical leap. 

"There wasn't much backcourt 
hitting in high school," recalled 
Lam. "It was never a weapon." 

Lam's biggest lesson was alter-
ing his spectacular. yet ineffective. 
habit of spiking straight down. 

Skilled blockers had an easy 
time rejecting Lam, despite the 
great power of his spikes. 

He adjusted to the college-level 
blocking by hitting "higher and 
smarter," which isadmittedJy "less 
impressive ... 

At this point, Lam is in UCSD's 
starting lineup and is leading the 
team in kills. 

His offensive prowess has 
opened eyes and has pleased Head 
Coach Oscar "Digger" Graybill. 
But Graybill doesn't hesitate to 
point out possible areas for im-
provement in Lam's game. 

Making the analogy of a great 
basketball player who shoots the 
lights out but can't play defense, 
Graybill says Lam "is not a total 
player." 

"My blocking and digging an: 
really bad," Lam admitted. 

But no one seems to doubt that 
Lam will improve. 

"He's really coachable," 
Graybill said. 

"He's really enthusiastic and 
loves the game ... 

anything but an easy season. 1beir 
biggest weakness lies in the game's 
most notable aspect - offense. 

"As eve\)'one knows, you have 
to get on base to score runs and you 
have to score runs to win games," 
Jarrel said. "Hitting is not where I 
want it to be." 

Until it is, the Tritons will have 
to play to their strengths - solid 
defense and pitching. 

"We should be able to beat out 
most of the teams in our di vision," 
larrel said. "It's a matter of playing 
consistently. We have to beat the 
teams we can beat."

Making a Good Impression 
• Preview: Baseball can give the 
Regional Selection Committee 
some earty food for thought with a 
good showing this weekend 
By Rex GreY1*' 
Stslf Writer 

For the UCSD bascba1lleam, this weekend marks 
a crucial step in their 1991 season. 

The Tritons (0-3) begin their Division m compe-
tition Friday as they host rival Occidental. Saturday, 
UCSD faces NAIA foe The Master's College. 

UCSD was denied a spot in last year's Division m 
Western Regional Playoff, largely because of its ho-
hum 10-6-1 record in Division m. 

"We definitely owe Oxy something fierce," Yales 
said. "[Their) head coach is the chainnan of the 
NCAA Weslern Regional Selection Committee, and 
has a say as to whether we earn a bid in the playoffs 
or not 

"We need to make a solid impression on them this 
weekend." 

Brent Hansen, who pitched well in UCSD's loss to 
Cal Lutheran last weekend, will gel the stan against 
Occidental. 

" I have a lot of confidence in Brent," Yates said. 

"I like hi approach on the mound. He has poise, 
and keeps his 'game face' on for the entire ballgame. 
He isn't rattled easily." 

Offensively, the Tritons hope to add a little pop to 
their lineup with the addilion of injured sluggers 
Ernie Isola and Joe DeFranco. 

"They will definitely see some time this weekend, 
but I'm not sure how much," Yates said. " 1 want to 
work them in slowly, bUI we need their bats in our 
lineup," 

On Saturday, UCSD hosts The Master's College 
in a doubleheader. 

In 1990, the Mustangs swepl the Tritol1$ in three 
games, two of which were forced into extra innings. 

''They're always pretty solid," Yates said. "I felt 
that we gave them two of the three wil1$ over us, 
though. This year we can't afford to give them any-
thing." 

Sophomore left-hander Ryan Flanagan, who has 
made three appearances in relief this year, will get his 
first stan in the opener. Junior Bryan lbomason, who 
has sparkled in his last two appearances - both in 
relief - will stan the nightcap, 

"If everything goes as planned, [won't need Ryan 
orBryanfortheOxy game," Yates said. "[But) I'll use 
them iff need them, I'll use the whole squad iff have 
to in order to beal Oxy."

SLEEPING 
WITH THE 

ENEMY 

By Andy Clarke and Simon Hobbs 
Staff Writers 

Hollywood has spoken! The "Fatal 
Attraction" syndrome of encouraging 
people to find marital bliss is seem-
ingly over. Matrimony is under a ttack 
again by the film industry - walk 
down the aisle in J 991 and you could 
be saying "I Do" to a psychotic! 

This, at least, is the premise of the 
new Julia Roberts movie, "Sleeping 
with the Enemy." She plays Laura 
Burney, married for almost four years 
to Martin (Patrick Bergin) who be-
comes increasingly violent and de-
structive in expressing the depths of 
his passion for her. While appearing to 
be the ideal couple on the outside, 
Laura is forced to fake her own death 
to escape the abusive relationship . 

Hiding in the Midwest under an 
assumed identity, Laura fonns a 
friendship with a drama teacher (Kevin 
Anderson) and begins a new life. 
Unfortunately, she gets into all sorts of 
trouble when Martin finaUy tracks her 
down. 

Currently unwilling to even glance 
at a script promising less than a million 
dollars, Julia Roberts has certainly 
come a long way very fast. It is hard to 
believe that not so long ago, the 22-
year old Georgia native's only claim to 
fame was the fact that she was actor 
Eric Roberts' sister. 

At the start of 1990, Roberts was 
just pulling away from the pack, 
gaining an Oscar nomination and the 
Golden Globe award for Best Support-
ing Actress in "Steel Magnolias." 
However, her decision to Page H3

Love, San Diego Style 
Valentine's Day is probably one of the worst 

holidays. It puts a lot of train on everyone, If you 
aren't in love, you are already well aware of this and 
don't need a holiday to remind you. If you are in 
love, every day is Valentine's Day and the holiday 
is just a Hallmark hoax. But we in HiATUS buy into 
it, wholeheartedly. Sometimes the pre sure to have 
a really romantic day or night become overwhelm-
ing, so we have compiled a list of activities and 
mood enhancers for your Valentine ' s Day pleasure.

handy year 'round - filii elate, parents' viiirs, or 
any 01' time. 
• PLACeS TO Go 

• RoIIerrouIer" Million Bay - You gee to 
fall right into the gender roles -the woman acts to

be t to visit this monument at night as the ligbla 
illuminate the sky. 

• Balboa Park- From the lily pond In front of 
the botanical gardens to the aeyser under the wbile 
lights by the Space 'IbeIIIer to the Tirnkin Gallery.

reminded thatthis placecxi .... We all know aboutiC. 
but we forget it's there, ltisbesttoJOoD a clear nigbe 
to take full advantage of the gorgeous view. 

• Seaport Village - This outdoor ~ off_ 
very little excitement in its stores, but the an:biteC-
tureofthe "village" is quite romantic, compJetewida 
bridges, fish ponds, vast lawns, and lots of exodc 
flowers. Seaport Village is a wonderful place 10 
stroll hand- in-hand with someone you love. 
• ReSTAURANTS 

• French Side of the West - Complete with 
real French-speaking natives, authentic hors 
d 'oeuvres, tantalizing entr6es and candle-lit tables,

• MOVIES TO RENT 

• "Love Story" - What can you say about a 20-

year-old movie that lives? Erich Segal's Romeo and 
Juliet-esque tale, de pite its tragic ending, is ideal for 
Valentine's Day with its beautiful. moving, and real-
istic depictions of the love between Oliver and Jenny. 

• "Roxanne" - Inspired by the French clas ic 
"Cyrano De Bergerac" (now playing at the Cove 
Theater), Steve Martin's new classic "Roxanne" takes 
the timeless dilemma of misplaced values in love and 
places the action in a modem setting. The happy and 
didact ic endina reminds us all of the importance of the 
heart and soul- in lead oftbe face and body. 

• "ADDie HaU"- True, he doesn't ptthe girl in

• us., Any thiDa" - This is the movie where 
every girl faDs in love with John CusacIc for the first

• .... dtrac:k from Twin Peaks/Angelo 
Badll~ti - You don't have to watch the show to 
ervoy Ibe album. The hauntingly mystical feel to this 
album transcends sappy love songs and achieves a 
more cerebral sensuality. Julee Cruise's lilting, airy 
vocals combined with the instrumental compositions 
of Badalamehti create a mood of pure serenity. 

• AvaJonIRoxy Music - This is the best mood 
music around. Bryan Ferry's smooth-as-silk voice and 
romantic lyrics will never fail. This, like Ravel's 
Bolero, is good fordinnermusic, or for relaxing by the 
fire. 

• Soundtrack from ''The Hot Spot" - This is the 
best blues compilation ever. Just listening to artists 
like John Lee Hooker, Miles Davis, and Taj Mahal 
playing together is enough to tum anyone on. This is 
very mellow blues, unlike some of Miles Davis' more 
hectic music. A good bet for your Valentine. 

• ... Nothing Like the Sun/Sting - Listening to 
Sting's album is the musical equivalent of listening 10 
beautifully recited poetry. His romantic lyrics elicit 
images of young lovers, starry nights, ITIOOnlit waters, 
slow dances - everything you like to think about on 
Valentine's day .

Martialling the Art of 
Hollywood in Action 
• Movie-star-to-be Jeff Speakman 
demonstrated his methods on campus 
By Mary Betty He.rd 
S8nior Staff Writer 

Studying the martial arts tends 
to make one skeptical of martial 
arts movies. After all, everyone 
knows that those films are glam-
orized. Case in point: the crane 
move used by the Karate Kid. Sorry 
folks, but that move would never 
be used by a real martial artist, 

So when Jeff Speakman, touted 
as the next Steven Segal, appeared 
on campus at the Alex P. Spanos 
facility, people may not have ex-
pected much. After all, he is Hol-
lywood. 

Southern University, it was only 
natural that he began studying 
Japanese Goju-ru Karate under 
10th-degree black belt Lou Angel. 

Under Angel's instruction, 
Speakman achieved his fifth-de-
gree black belt. After receiving his 
Bachelor's Degree in Psychology, 
Angel urged Speakman to go to 
Los Angeles and continue his 
martial arts training with Parker. 

The UCSD Guardian 

According to 
Speakman, the 
movie is the first 
film to showcase 
American Kenpo. 
The scenes were 
tailored to Kenpo by 
Parker, who over-
saw every scene. 
'Tmjust grateful he 
stayed alive long 
enough to see the 
whole film shot," 
Speakman said. 

Seventy percent 
of the film's action 
scenes were done by 
sluntmen, accord-
ing to Speakman . 
"They are incred-
ible," Speakman 
said. But for the 
most dangerou 

Well, not quite. Among 
Speakman's credits are a fourth-
degree black belt in American 
Kenpo and a fifth-degree black belt 
in Japanese Goju-ru Karate, He 
has studied under Grand Master 
Ed Parker, father of American 
Kenpo and trainer for such famous 
people as Bruce Lee and Elvis 
Presley. At one point he had his 
own dojo (martial arts studio) in 
Missouri, called the Academy of 
Self Defense. 

Speakman described himself 
and fellow students under Parker 
as "state of the art." According to 
Speakman, Parker constantly im-
proved upon his own techniques, 
so that the last group of proteges 
before Parker died last December 
received the most advanced train-
ing. 

Jeff Speakman: "The violent nature of Kenpo 
is not violence for the sake of violence." 

cenes, Speakman 
said that he u ed hi 
own black belts. 

When ques-

In an interview after his pre-
sentation, Speak.manexplained that 
as a child he "had a fascination 
with the T.V. series 'Kung Fu'" 
and that he had always been active 
when he was younger, especially 
in high school gymnastics. So when 
he entered college at Missouri 

At his demonstration last 
Monday, Speakman described 
Parker's style as "violent geom-
etry," employing laws of physics 
and geometry to strike an 
opponent's body in a particular 
place to get a result. 

"A great Kenpoist is analogous 
to a great billiards player: one shot 
sets up the next," Speakman said. 
He added that each Kenpoist has 
their own unique style. Once the 
basic moves are leamed, the mar-
tial artist tailors the system to match 
his or her needs. No one's Kenpo 
looks the same, but all are appli-
cable to street fighting. 

One piece of advice he gave the 
audience of martial arts students 
was, "Never kick above the waist. 
We kick to the face, but first we 
pull [the opponent's) face down." 
He then demonstrated a low side 
kick that was intended to break an 
opponent's knee. This move and 
others Speakman demonstrated 
were intended for street fighting 
and not Sludio sparring. 

Speakman advised that one 
should always watch an opponent's 
shoulders. "The opponent's body 
position tells you what is going to 
happen," Speakman said. 

Speakman will be starring in 
the movie "The Perfect Weapon," 
scheduled for release in March.

tioned about the effect of SO vio-
lent a movie on young audience, 
Speakman said, "I think it's ex-
pressed clearly in the movie that 
the violent nature of Kenpo is not 
violence for the sake of violence." 
He felt that since his character, Jeff 
Sanders, matures in his way of 
thinking during the movie, it will 
how audiences that a quick tem-

per and lack of focus are not de-
sired qualitie for a martial artist. 

As for his own temperament, 
Speakman said he has never used 
his Kenpo outsideofthedojo. "But 
I use it in everything I do," 
Speakman said. "I have never used 
it in the physical sense, and I hope 
I never do." 

HIATUS 3 

SLEEPING 
Continued from H1 
go with a medium-budget tale of a 
happy hooker falling for a corpo-
rate raider (with an only-in-Holly-
wood ending) made hera superstar. 
"Pretty Woman" has already 
earned $178.4 million at home and 
$232 million abroad making Julia 
Roberts (and those PVC thigh 
boots) virtually an overnIght sen-
sation. This summer's " Flatliners" 
only cemented her s tatus as 
cinema's hottest new act . 

The role of the leading charac-
ter in "Sleeping with the Enemy" 
offers a potential tour-de-force for 
any actress. In a sense, Robens 
plays two different parts. As Laura, 
she has to literally act for her Ii fe 
- to convince Martin that he 
loves him, i devoted and sexually 
attracted to him, because her 
physical safety depends on it. Yet 
when she stans her new life, her 
new character is more open, pon-
taneous and alive. 

This movie has the actress dis-
playing many of the qualities that 
have endeared her to audiences. 
Julia Roberts is able to combine 
obvious sexuality with sensitivity, 
a combination that few since 
Marilyn Monroe have managed. 
As Monroe demonstrated, this fea-
ture makes her extremely attrac-
tive to both men and women. The 
scenes of mental and physical abuse 
between Patrick Bergin and Julia 
Roberts are painful to witness, since 
Roberts seems fearless in reveal-
ing her feelings. She has to appear 
vulnerable in almost every scene,a 
demand that probably explains the

A Neo-Neo-Classical Tale 
of Love and Vampires 
By Michael Schwartz 
Senior Staff Writer 

"I've always liked vampires." 
Third-year graduate playwright 

Troy Cardenas will see his vam-
pires brought to life in his thesis 
project, "Deadly Calm," at the 
Warren Theatre. 

"They possess relentlessness 
and hedonism. They don't seem to 
care," Cardenas mused before a 
recent rehearsal. "The play uses a 
classical tragic form. Greek trag-
edies are my favorite plays." 

Set in a large city on the water, 
the play examines the triangle of 
relations between two immortals 
and a half-mortal. "It is fixed on 
Earth Standard Location," 
Cardenas added. 

In view of "The Lost Boys" and 
Anne Rice books, the subject of 
vampires is slipping into American 
culture. "For us, the important thing 
that vampire allow u to do is 
create a triangle of relation hip 
and a constant struggle of power," 
aid faculty Director J im Carmody. 

"It's a play about love 
and power. And because 
it's about immortal 
creatures, it puts the play 
on a higher emotional 
pilCh." 

Looking especially at 
the tragedies of France 
and other earlier forms, 
Carmody describes the 
work as a "neo-neo-
classical" tale. And 
while influenced by 
Cardenas' vision of the 
world as "not a nice 
place," the work is not a 
morality play. 

'There's no message 
in the play," Cannody declares. 

"There' a question. How far 
will you go to get power and con-
trol overthe person you love? How 
much doe pas ion control you and 
how much do you control it?"

reported exhaustion Roberts suf-
fered during the filming. 

Although "Sleeping With the 
Enemy" is essentially a star-ve-
hicle, the two actors that share the 
billing with Roberts give very able 
support. The drive for perfection 
demonstrated by Martin Burney is 
essentially an all-American trait. 
Here it is taken to its extreme, 
making the apparently - normal 
man-next-door highly dangerous. 
Patrick Bergin successfully man-
ages to convey both the charm and 
the menace demanded by his role. 
TIle presence he creates during his 
initial scenes with Roberts is so 
intense that it manage to remain 
even when Bergin is off-screen. 

Ben Woodward, played by 
Kevin Anderson, is Martin 
Bumey's alter-ego in the small

trange as the husband Laura has 
escaped from, but the warmth that 
Anderson gives the role makes the 
romantic developments feasible. 
Like Bergin, Kevin Anderson is 
relatively unknown in the indus-
try- but this film is very likely to 
propel them both to a far wider 
audience. 

Screenwriter Ronald Bass, best 
known for his Oscar-winning "Rain 
Man," has certainly come up with 
a novel plot of a man who decides 
that murder is a more satisfactory 
solution to marital trauma than di-
vorce. There is a very strong "Fatal 
Attraction" feel to the plot, how-
ever, and predictable camera work 
undermines too much of the ten-
sion. The screenplay also has just a 
few too many "if only .. . " coinci-
dences. You don't need to be a 
genius to guess the ending, but it is 
executed with considerable style 
and contains one of the best clos-
ing lines in a long time.

The fiJm was obviously going 
to be safe in the hands of Director 
Joseph Ruben. His previous pro-
ductions, ''True Believer" and "The 
Stepfather," all evoke a visceral 
response, and the relentless pursuit 
in this film is no exception. 

Director of Photography John 
Lindley, who also worked with 
Ruben on ''True Believer" and "'The 
Stepfather,", was responsible for 
the stylized feel to the film that 
reflects traits from the main char-
acters' personalities. Martin 
Bumey's house that appears at the 
start of the film is a stunning piece 
of high-tech archi tecture. It reflects 
his calculating, tough, and cold 
persona. Dark marble floors and 
the use of dark: surfaces of water 
become a common thread in the 
early scenes. In contrast, the Iowa 
countryside is warmer which vi-
sually represents Laura's spiritual 

• sanctuary. When Martin catches 
up with her, John LindJey allows 
the darkness to return again. 

This is a movie that makes you 
realize you do not need features 
about knife-fingered killers to be 
scared. Often, there are enough 
frightening things going on next 
door.
