DAVIS - Accusations of 
impropriety within the 
California Aggie Marching 
Band have led officials at the 
UCD Student Programs and 
Activities Center to begin a 
thorough review of the band's 
practices. One former band 
member lodged a complaint 
with the UCD Office of 
Student Judicial Affairs in late 
September, alleging that the 
band's treatment of first-year 
students violates state and 
university policies, including 
what he called, "a psychologi-

and intimidating atmosphere." 
Because of logistical and legal 
complications, the review is 
not expected to be completed 
until later in the year.

Hunger Strikers Fold Up Their Tents 
Five UC Irvine hunger strikers, who have 

been protesting the regents' summer decision 
to end affirmative action, ended their 16-day 
fast Wednesday, citing health concerns. 

The hunger strikers were arrested by UCI 
police Sunday morning after failing to leave 
campus by midnight on Friday, Oct. 27 - the 
date specified in the strikers' contract with the 
university. The'students continued their strike 
in jail and were released that evening. 

On Tuesday, the protesters flew to the state 
capital and met with Sacramento Mayor Joe 
Serna, Jr., who declared his support for their 

cause. The strikers also presented California 
State Senator Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) 
with a list of their demands. The protesters 
then tried to meet with Gov. Pete Wilson, but 
he refused to see them. 

The strikers returned to Irvine yesterday af-
ternoon, where they announced the end of their 
strike. The protesters said they felt the strike was 
successful, pointing to a motion on the Novem-
ber Board of Regents' meeting agenda to suggest 
a re-vote on affirmative action.

Candlelight 
Vigil Backs 
U CI Strikers 
MIDNIGHT: UCSD No Retreat! 
members show support Monday 
in Price Center plaza 
By Suketu V_hnav 
StBff Writer 

No Retreat!, the self-proclaimed UCSD civil-
rights organization, held a midnight vigil in the 
Price Center plaza on Monday, pledging its soli-
darity with the hunger strikers at UCI, who are 
protesting against the elimination of affirmative-
action programs. 

The vigil was attended by 25 UCSD students, 
who performed various activities to affirm their 
support.for the strikers and their goals. 

Despite the low turnout, No Retreat! members 
felt the event was a success. 

"It was not the quantity of the people, but the 
quality," Roosevelt sophomore Alex Tom, a No 
Retreat! member, said. "We have the support and 
passion of the students at UCSD. 

"We are all here in the struggle for affirmative 
action, and we're supporting the hunger strikers," 
he said. "Why must five people go through so much 
mental, emotional and physical pain in order to 
undo such an injustice?" 

AS. Vice President External Brian Dowd agreed, 
saying the purpose of the event was to show UCSD's 
"moral and spiritual" backing for the strikers and 
their cause. 

"We support [the strikers] in their cause for 
social justice, unequivocally," he said. 

The rally began with a moment of silence for the 
protesters, after which the microphone was opened 
up to the public. 

"The reason we are here today is to achieve civil 
rights and social equality for students in Califor-
nia," Marshall junior Coleen Sabatini said. 

Attendees at the vigil wrote letters to the UC 
regents, urging them to support affirmative-action 
programs, and also signed a "UCSD supports the 
UCI hunger strikers" poster, which was then sent to 
the strikers at Irvine. 

"There is a serenity in the situation," Marshall 
sophomore Ingrid Benedict said. "We should ac-
knowledge that the university is at a crossroads, 
and everyone should be educated on the issue of 
affirmative action." 

Tom added that the debate over affirmative 
action will not end anytime soon. 

"This will be an ongoing issue. People doR't 
understand how this will affect the future of-our 
nation and our children," he said.

GEOSAT: Research culminates in Scripps and 
NOM scientists charting topography of sea floor 
By Rebecc. Sn.vely key interest. 
Guardian Reporter 

Using satellite data, scientists at 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanog-
raphy (SID) and the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) have developed the 
most precise mapofthe global ocean 
floor to date. 

Satellite maps also provide in-
formation on areas of the sea which 
are difficult to reach by ship. The 
Geosat data led to the discovery of a 
chain of underwater volcanoes south 
of Easter Island, which previously 
escaped detection because of their 

Construction of 
the map was made 
possible when the 
U.S. Department of 
Defense declassi-
fied data collected 
by the Geosat satel-
lite, which moni-
tored the earth from 
1985 to 1990. 

"We spent years 
polishing our tech-
nique, getting ready 
for the day when the 
satellite data would 
be declassified," 
NOAA Geophysicist 
Walter Smith said.

location as the far-
thest point on earth 
from inhabited 
land. 

"It's nasty down 
there," Williams 
said. "The waves 
reach up to fifty feet 
high." 

Smith developed 
the map with David 
Sandwell, a profes-
sor at SID's Insti-
tute for Geophysics 
and Planetary Phys-
ics.

Satellite maps 
expedite research, 
by pointing out ar-
eas of interest and 
el iminati ng the need 
to scan vast areas of 
ocean by ship. Re-
searchers can now 
go directly to these 
sites and - using 

acousticlOUnd~ 
equipment such as 
SID's Sea Beam-
map them with 10 
times the detail of 
satellite: maps. 

Due to the in-
"This data pro-

vides us with the first overall view of 
70 percent of the Earth in very fine 
detail," Sandwell said. 

Sandwell and Smith used Geosat 
information, as well as data gathered 
by the European ERS-l satellite, to 
construct the map. The satellite infor-
mation dircctJy represents only the 
topography of the ocean's surface. 

Scienlists must then extrapolate 
what the ocean floor looks like by 
measuring the strength and direc-
tion of gravitational fields on the 
ocean's surface, which mark geo-
physical structures on the ocean floor 
- such as volcanoes and trenches. 

An unprecedented breakthrough 
in underwater exploration, the sea 
floor map promises both scientific 
and economic rewards. 

Smith indicated Ihat oil compa-
nies, for example, "clearly have an 
interest" in the ocean mapping. In 
addition, the topography of areas 
with large petroleum reserves are of 

tensive nature of 
shipboard surveys, however, satel-
lites make global ocean floor map-' 
ping much easier. Sandwell esti-
mates that it would take 125 years to 
chart the ocean floor without satel-
lite assistance. • 

The Geosat data was initially 
classified for national security rea-
sons, although the Navy began to 
declassify it in 1990, in response to 
scientific requests and pressure from 
the U.S. Senate. 

ERS-I, a multi-use satellite, was 
launched by the European Commu-
nity in 1990. Its data was released in 
t 994, and the Navy declassified the 
remaining Geosat data in 1995. 

Once both Geosat and ERS-! 
information was available, it took 
only two weeks for Sand well and 
Smith to compile a map of the glo-
bal sea surface. Several more months 
will be required, however, before 
the data is translated into a detailed 
map of the sea floor.

UCSD R .... rchers to Study 
Immigrants In S.D., Japan 

The Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UCSD 
recently received $400,000 in grants fOf research on 
immigrant labor in the economies of San Diego County 
and Hamamatsu, a Japanese industrial city. 

A $200,000 grant from the James Irvine Founda-
tion of California will support the San Diego portion of 
the study, which will develop more comprehensive 
data on the role of immigrant workers in the regional 
economy. 

The Japan Foundation's Center for Global Partner-
ship has awarded the remaining $200,000 to support 
comparable research in Hamamatsu, which has long 
been a magnet for Immigrant workers from Latin 
America and Asian countries. 

The project will compare the ways in which foreign. 
bom workers are being used In similar sectors of the 
U.S. and Japanese economies, placing a special 
emphasis on manufacturina, construction, services 
and agriculture.

A.S. Debates Funding 
COUNCIL: Myriad of 
topics covered in 
weekly meeting 
By Either Yoon 
Staff Writer 

Topics -ranging from the allo-
cation of A.S. fU:ll:s to proposed 
changes . 10 UCSD's 
"Affordability Model" - guide-
lines for fees. undergraduate fi-
nancial aid and the use of gov-
ernment funding - dominated 
the discussion allast night'sA.S. 
Council meeting. 

[n one of the Council's first 
orders of business, A.S. Vice 
President of Finance Edmondo 
Robinson proposed changes to 
UCSD's "Affordability Model," 
including amendments aimed at 
granting more flexibility in work-
study expectations for students 
on financial aid. 

The changes are timed to co-
incide with the UC regents' re-
cent 7.1 percent fee increase pro-
posal for 1996-97, Robinson said. 

Later in the meeting, A.S. 

Vice President of External Af-
fairs Brian Dowd's request for 
funding UCSD membership in 
the United States Siudent Asso-
ciation (USSA) failed 10 pass 
Ihrough council. 

The $900 membership fee, ac-
cording to Dowd,covers USSA's 
operating COSIS. USSA connects 
individual universities and in-
forms student councils aboul 
national issues impacting their 
students. 

Dowd also announced upcom-
ing statewide events sponsored 
by the A.S. Office of External 
Affairs - including a rally for 
the reinstatement of affirmative-
aClion policies. The protest is 
scheduled for Monday, Nov. 6 at 
the office of UC Regent John 
Davies. 

The A.S. Office of External

Student Cafe Reopens With Party 
BASH: Haunted house 
and costume contest 
mark festivities 
By Suketu V.llhuv 
Staff Writer 

Why Not Here?, Revelle 
College's student-run cafe, attracted 
a modest turnout Tuesday for its 
reopening celebration, which fea-
tured a haunted house and costume 
conlest. 

"We looked forward to a large 
crowd of people, and I think we did 
pretty well," Why Not Here? advi-
sor Lucy Holman said. 

Although construction on the 
Plaza Cafe - Anchorview's re-
placement, which is currently under 
construction - has reduced the size 
of Why Not Here? by one-third, the 
smaller cafe now offers prepack-
aged goods at lower prices than other 
campus retailers, as well as various 
coffee drinks from a new espresso 
machine. 

The Why Not Here? staff said it 
will try to preserve last year's ser-
vices and menu.

haunted house was pretty cool, and 
I love Why Not Here?" 

Although last year's soda-foun-

Hunger Sbtkers Wasted 
Away aid wasted Time 

In a pitiful attempt to emulate the late ChC Guevara or 
Mahatma Gandhi, five students - four from UC Irvine and 
one from the aaremont colleges - began a hunger strike 
against the UC regents three weeks ago. Desperately search-
ing for a "cause" in the 19908, no doubt 10 fulfill an obliga-
tion to their forbearers of the 1960s, the strikers issued five 
demands under the penalty of their deaths (or, as it turned 
out, until they decided to start eating). 

The first of these demands was "The reinstatement and 
revision of affirmative action throughout the UC system." 
The hunger strikers and their supporters clearly feel, even 
now, that affirmative action is the Civil Rights battie of this 
decade. That might be true, but they are on the wrong side of 
the war. Bringing back a program which awards points based 
on race is a step toward racial division, not equality. 

The hunger strikers should have focused on the root cause 
of the UC system's lack of diversity: economic circumstance. 
1bey should not have "put Iheir life on the line" for the 
affmnative-action dinosaur - which, at the moment, is 
slowly creeping into extinction across the nation - and 
instead attacked the problem at its source. That is, they 
should have spent their time striving toward better funding 
for low-income primary and secondary schools, or jlfguing 
for an admissions program based on family income. Doing so 
might have made positive progress toward achieving their 
second demand, "Accurate and equal representation of 
California's diverse population within the university." 

1be strikers' third and fourth demands - "A reversal of the 
last five years' fee hikes" and "Additional financial aid propor-
tional to tuition increases" - also dodged the real issue at hand. 
The regents' current structure for funding higher education, the 
"Return to Aid" model, provides that for every increase in fees, 
33 percent of the money must go to financial aid. The strikers' 
two demands, then, were contradictory. Lowering fees would 
have lowered the amount of money given to fmancial aid. 
Raising fmancial aid would have raised fees. 

So, instead of making impossible and pointless demands, 
the hunger strikers should have focused on the rool of the 
problem: the regents' current "Return to Aid" model. 

A completely different higher-education funding proposal, 
the "Affordability Model," is now in the works. It is based on 
the actual costs of going to a UC school, factoring in campus-
specific fees and the increase of financial aid applicants when 
fees rise. The protestors should have channeled their energy 
into fighting for the implementation of this model, instead of 
making foolish demands. 

The hunger strikers' last demand, that "No charges be filed 
against [them)" was the only reasonable one in the bunch. 
Indeed, they should have been permitted to protest without 
hindrance, in accordance with their First Amendment rights. 

However, these students should have also considered the 
consequences of their actions. In their weak attempt to 
blackmail the regents with attempted suicides, the protestors 
directed negati~e publicity upon themselves. After all, the 
very people the hunger strikers aimed to serve were not 
helped by such misguided demands. Furthermore, Ihe stu-
dents obviously weren't too serious about hunger striking-
none of the five demands have been met, and the ragged 
solidarity camp still reeks of empty rhetoric and pointless 
symbolism.

THE MARK OF A MODERN 

MAN 
SADRE: With all the "relationship quizzes" offered in women's 
magazines, like Cosmo and Vogue, here's finally a test for men 

In the race to quantify and 
scrutioize relationships, 
today's women have a great 
advantage over modern men. 
This is especially evident with 
numerous women's magazines 
routinely publishing "relation-
ship quizzes" designed to 
gauge the degree of emotional Pet e r intimacy they have with their

significant others. 
Having recently ended a re-

lationship that 
survived long 
enough to go 
through four 
questionnaires 

- a combination of weakness of 
spirit and a deficiency of will - I 
wondered if a male equivalent of the 
"relationship test" existed. 

c) sell it to whichever creepy, tin-pot dictator of-
fers you the highest bid. 

d) take it apart to see how it works.

so I won't miss what she has to say. ('U just be a 
minute." 

b) Nothing. You mute the television and attempt 
to follow the game while also offering the proper 
relationship noises (e.g. "uh huh, sure, I under-
stand. ") 

c) "Hey! iloid you not to call dur-

d) "Hey! Who the hell recon-

4. Vour choice of uodergar.

a) Briefs 
b) Boxers 
c) Leopard-spotted bikini briefs 
d) Underwear? Who needs under-

The only available "men's" 
magazines seem to be filled with un-
derwear ads, featuring male models 
with low body fat in vaguely seduc-
tive poses. This occasionally stirs 
enough homophobic impulses to en-
courage most sensible men to drop 
the magazine at the first opportunity, 
lest they should be caught looking at 
a male underwear ad.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thunday, November 2, 1995 

COMMENTARY: While retired General Colin Powell seems to have captured the public's fascination without 
taking a stand on major issues, true American leadership is not always based on one's aura 

POWELL'S POPULARITY BASED ON PERSONA 
By Bin GJanzmann 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Colin Powell. The name alone 
has a certain mystique which seems 
to arouse excitement, enthusiasm 
and speculation among a cross-sec-
tion of Americans. 

Powell recently visited a La Jolla 
bookstore, promoting his new au-
tobiography, My AmericQn Journey, 
and - in the process of his nation-
wide publicity tour - he is making 
many Americans drool at the pros-
pect of his candidacy. As a third-
party presidential candidate, Powell 
would possibly be a better sequel to 
Ross Perot 's independent showing 
in 1992. 

But who exactly is this man, and 
why is he so appealing? 

Born in Harlem to a hard-work-
ing family of Jamaican immigrants, 
Powell joined the army early in his 
life and rapidly ascended within its 
ranks. In Vietnam, he worked as a 
military advisor and battalion com-
mander, eventually rising to become 
national security advisor to Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan. Most recently, 
he served as chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff under President 
George Bush, where he played a 
critical role in making the Persain 
Gulf War a success. And when 
Powell retired from the military on 
Sept. 30, 1993, President Clinton 
gave Powell the prestigious Presi-
dential Medal with Distinction. 

In short, Powell's life embodies 
the American dream: I poor boy 

from the ghetto rises to achieve 
greatness and resounding success 
through discipline and determina-
tion. 

Given his life achievements, 
Powell radiates a powerful sense of 
charisma, leadership and trustwor-
thiness, which translates into high 
marks in popularity polls. A self-
proclaimed "fiscal conservative 
with a social conscience," he is the 
best of both worlds to the majority 
of the electorate. 

He appeals to those who distrust 
big-government, tax-and-spend lib-
erals, but who also sympathize with 
the poor and cannot justify the re-
duction of spending for all welfare 
programs simply to reduce the defi-
cit. Powell has further stated that he 
disavows the rigid ideologies of the 
far left and the extreme right, and 
he has said that the time has come 
for a candidate who is in the "sen-
sible center of the American politi-
cal spectrum." 

A self-proclaimed 
Mflscal 
conservative with 
a social 
conscience, "

the majortty of the 
electorate. 

Undoubtedly, no moderate pos- president, who rose from an up-

populace, Ureat popularity by no means trans-

The prospect of having a black lates into political and legislative 

success. Clinton is a prime example. 
In fact, despite his infectious 

optimism and rhetoric, Powell has 
not outlined clear policy goals. 
Rather, he has made vague state-
ments both supporting free enter-
prise and criticizing cunent govern-
ment bureaucracy. 

Furthermore, he has not clearly 
stated his positions on several con-
troversial issues - like prayer in 
schools or doctor-assisted suicide. 
If he decides to run for the presi-
dency, the stands he takes on such 
issues could very well alienate sig-
nificant portions of the electorate. 

Although Powell is currently a 
transcendent political figure, that 
could quickly change if elected to 
office. His aura would soon dissi-
pate before the political realities of 
debate, conference and deal-making 
witb Congress. He will be faced 
with an implacably slow and disap-
pointing process to those expecting 
to pass specific agendas quickly and 
entirely. 

Moreover, one must realize how 
the founding fatben designed the 
U.S. Constitution: The legislative 
process would foster rational de-
bate, deliberation and compromise. 
They greatly feared a system which 
would allow a mob-like, overriding 
majority to seize and monopolize 
power over the legislature. Checks 
and balances, federalism and sepa-
ration of po"en were created to 
keep those fears at bay. 

Nevertheless, certain individu-

als, Ii ke former presidents Dwight 
D. Bisenhower and John F. 
Kennedy, bave such profound cha-
risma that the electorate simply be-
comes enamored with them. Their 
intangible, yet powerful, attributes 
of leadership and authority - much 
like the divine priest-king in primi-
tive cultures - inspire awe and re-
spect in the ~asses. 

In the face of such an individual, 
the public often forgets or overlooks 
the reality of the state's pragmatic 
affairs, as well as the economy IS a 
whole, and instead romanticizes the 
"reign" of this individual. Often, 
people feel as though their personal 
well-being is inextricably bound up 
in the actions and guidance of this 
leader. This situation was perfectly 
articulated during Kennedy's presi-
dency, which is often referred to as 
"Camelot." The power of these 
presidents' legacies lies not so 
much in any actual legislation or 
policy goals they may have pushed 
through Congress, but rather in the 
myth of their charismatic leader-
ship and persona. 

Many perceive Colin Powell to 
have these characteristics, and -
in an often chaotic and confusing 
age - his stature and stability are 
welcomed by a disillusioned elec-
torate. However irrational and un-
reasonable it may be, Colin Powell 
could be elected by the American 
people as their next" great" leader. 
He could become the president of 
the United States.

EdItor: 
The GUIlrdian's recent editorial 

on the Lib.rary Walk, in which you 
blame students for its "alien land-
ing pad" look, has the facts wrong 
("Library Walk: Be Careful What 
You Ask For ... " Oct. 26, 1995). 

The project design was finalized 
in 1994, construction bids were 0b-
tained in February 1995 and construc-
tion was carried out, IS designed, at a 
cost of over $3 miUion. No downgrad-
ing whalsoever occured "amid student 
protest," as the editorial states. These 
protests took place in March 1995, but 
any changes to the project happened 
during the planning process many 
months earlier. 

Thus, the the Librlry Walk's 
"space runway" look is not the stu-
dents' fault, but is precisely what the 
administration planned - without 
student input. If there had been stu-
dent input early on, some sensible 
voices might have suggested that re-
moving an existing 26-foot-wide 
walkway and 270 healthy trees to 
build a 30-foot-wide walkway was 
nonsense. By preserving what was 
already there, one could have had 
an attractive, albeit unstriped, walk-
way surrounded by mature vegeta-
tion at far less cost.

Instead, amid concerns that 
there would be I negative campus 
reaction to the planned project-
as stated in the recorded minutes 
of several meetings - adminis-
trators delayed informing students 
and the general campus commu-
nity about the project until only a 
few days before the start of con-

struction, when it was too late to 
make any changes. 

As anybody can appreciate, the 
Library Walk achieved one of the 
university's intended goals ex-
ceedingly well, as arranged in the 
UCSD Master Plan - to build a 
"view corridor" to the Central li-
brary. Whether the rest of the 
campus community shared with 
architects and administrators the 
conviction that this goal was 
worth $3 million and the death of 
270 trees does not seem to have 
been of much concern. 

And perhaps it is the 
administration's right to do these 
things. However, I am disturbed by 
the misinformation which was dis-
seminated to make the project plau-
sible - that 50 percent of the re-
moved trees were diseased, when 
in fact over 90 percent were healthy. 
And the idea of a view corridor was 
never discussed with the commit-
tees involved with the project. 

Your editorial misstated the facts 
and assigned responsibility to 
where it doesn't belong - on the 
students, rather than the adminis-
tration.

A1TACK: Rep. 
Duncan Hunter 
blasts Voz 
Continued from Pac. 1 
university, Falk said. 

"You don't shut down one of 
the best universities in the country 
because of what a few students are 
writing," FatkSaid. "It's ludicrous, 
and I don't think people in Con-
gress will take Hunter's proposal 
to end federal funding seriously." 

"If we began to monitor the 
content of these' newspapers, we 
would open ourselves up to law-
suits," she added. 

In addition, UCSD administra-
tors contend that Voz Fronteriza 's 
May article - despite being 
deemed "deplorable and offen-
sive" in a university statement re-
leased in July - is nevertheless 
protected under the First Amend-
ment, and that any attempts by the 
university to control the content of 
the A.S.-funded publication would 
be illegal. 

Vice Chancellor of Under-
graduate Affairs Joseph Watson 
cited the importance of the First 
Amendment in this situation. 

"As I understand ii, the First 
Amendment was not designed to 
protect only good and reasoned 
speech, [but] that it was really put 
in to protect unreasonable and fool-
ish speech," Watson said. "II was 
the view of this country that the 
best way to correct foolish speech 
was to have more speech, better 
speech and non-censored speech." 

Humberto Rosales, editor of 
Voz FronterizQ, said that despite 
Hunter's accusations to the con-
trary, the goal ofthe May edilorial 
was not to incite violence. 

"Duncan Hunter tried to equate 
our actions with screaming 'fire' 
in a crowded theater, 'l Rosales said. 

DEBATE: Falk 
proposes amendments 
to committee rules 
Continued from .,.,. 3 
council on the status of UCSO's 
chancellor search committee. Falk 
also announced her intentions to 
propose amendments to current 
search committee policies at the 
UC Regents' November meeting. 

One of Falk's amendments, if 
passed, would allow the students 
on the search committee to vote on . 
chancellor candidates. 

Her second proposal would re-
quire the candidates to spend time 
on campus with a group of students 
selected by the AS. and the Gradu-
ate Student Association Councils. 

"The current committee 
policy denies students an active 
role in the Ippointment of a new 
chancellor," she said. 

"But we're not doing that. We are 
just disclosing historical facts. 

"The purpose of the editorial 
was to bring 10 light the problems 
with the INS [Immigration and 
Naturalization Service], and that 
people need to question [the INS's] 
role, especially in regards to the 
Mexican popUlation," Rosales 
added. 

The current controversy began 
July 5, when Huntersenta letter to 
then UCSO Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson demanding a retraction 
of the article, as well as an apol-
ogy. 

In his letter, Hunter wrote that 
if these measures were not taken, 
"you can expect me to see to it that 
legislation will be immediately in-
troduced aimed at de-funding in-
stitutions whose publications ad-
vocate the killing of American of-
ficers." 

In a letter to Watson dated July 
6 this year, Hunter wrote: 

"To permit the advocacy of kill-
ing federal agents based on racist 
motives distorts the very tenets of 
protected speech and should not 
be tolerated by UCSD or any insti-
tution of higher learning." 

Correspondence between 
UCSO administrators and Hunter 

The UCSD Guardian 

has continued on a steady basis 
throughout the summer and into 
the fall quarter, with UCSD offi-
cials insisting that the VOZ 
Fronttriza's content is protected 
by the First Amendment. 

Stemming, in part, from the 
public outcry over the first article, 
a defense of the May editorial ap-
peared in the alternative-
newspaper's current issue: 

"The writer of this editorial had 
every right to vent his frustrations 
at a system that has proven itself to 
be contradictory in every way -
in terms of its call to justice and its 
equality to all." 

VOZ FronttrizQ and other alter-
native-media publications at 
UCSD are funded by the A.S. with 
money garnered through the 
$13.50 quarterly student activity 
fee. 

Watson stressed that the alter-
native media have no connection 
to the administration, nor do they 
in any way reflect the views of the 
university or the UC Board of Re-
gents. 

"Although we may have our 
own judgment about the quality 
and content of what they say, we 
do not want to get into censoring 
students," Watson said.

SUPPORT:

Continued from PIC. 1 

Prompted by the elimination 
of affirmative-action policies in 
UC admission, hiring and con-
tracting, four UCI students and 
one Claremont college student 
had began fasting on Oct. 17. 

Tbeir demands included the 
reinstatement of previous affir-
mative·action measures, the re-
cruitment and retention of 

underrepresented students, 
destructuring of the fee increase 
of the last five years, financial 
aid increases commensurate with 
tuition increases and that no par-
ticipant in the strike be denied 
their Constitutional right to pro-
test. 

After being arrested and re-
moved from the UCI campus 
Sunday morning, and after un-
successfully tlking tbeir de-
mands to Gov. Pete Wilson in 
Sacramento on Tuesday, the stu-
dents called off the strike yester-
day evening.

Tranc:e-lnducinc: The Master Musicians of Jajouka, who perform on Sunday at Mandeville 
Auditorium. play at ritual ceremonies In their Northern African homeland . 

Music Without Borders 
On their first U.S. iour, Master Musicians of 
lajouka will play at Mandevill~ Auditorium 

By Jeff NIeMI 
Hiatus Editor 

When Rolling Stone Brian Jones 
fitst visited the village of 
Jajouka in 1968, he was 
so mesmerized by the tra-
ditional musicians, he 
decided to record them 

• playingduringoneoftheir 
ritual festivals. Theresull-
ing album, "Brian Jones 
Presents the Pipes of Pan, " 
came out in 1971 -
shortly after Jones 
drowned in a swimming 
pool - and was hai led as one of the 
first world-music albums. 

Just last month, Point Music 
rereleased the album as the band started 
its fitst tour of the Uni ted States. Dur-
ing a recent phone interview, Bachir 
Attar (who was a child when he first 
met Jones) spoke about the future of 
his group and its tour, which includes 
a stop on Sunday at the Mandeville 
Auditorium. 
Guardian: How is the tour 
going? 

Attar: FortheaudienceinAmerica, 
the tour is incredible. Everyonestands 
up for us and is excited about the 
music of Jajouka. It's somethingspe-
cial for the people. Jajouka was the 
tirst world music, and everyone else 
has already got out [from their home-

land and gone on tour], but we are 
going out just now. Our music comes 
from one family, and we've kept it for 

thousands of years. People 
understand our music right 
away. The audience gets 
exciledandhappy. Every-
body stands up and gets in 
a trance. 
Does the Festival of 
Pan stil take place? 

Yes, it's gone on for 
hundreds of thousands of 
yeats. We have one week 
of music during the year 

from the time that Abraham slaugh-
tered the lamb. We start the music in 
the afternoon and play until dinner 
time. We eat our dinner and then go 
back to play until sunrise. We play 
special music only for Sou Jeloud, the 
man who dances inside the goat skin. 
This music - nobody in the world 
can copy this. It's a gift from God to 
us. Only the family can play this. We 
are the lost generation because no 
other children will learn this music. 
So the tradition of Jaiouka wII 
not continue? 

Yes, because there are no other 
kids. Everybody wants to go to school 
to learn English. Wedon 't have young 
people to learn the music because the 
world has changed. I'm upset about 
this. We need someone special who 

will care about the music to keep it 
going. Wedon't make money. I don't 
have money to give to the children. 
We hope the kids will think about 
[carrying in the tradition] after our 
tour. 
What do you remember about 
Brian Jones? 

I met him when I was four-and-a-
half yeats old. He stayed only for one 
night. He was a hippie. He had big hair 
and a coat like goatskin. He looked 
like Sou Jeloud . He was shaking and 
dancing. Everybody loved this guy 
because he was so different. For me, it 
was exciting. I still remember it like it 
was yesterday. 
Are you a fan of rock music? 

Yes. The first timel heard rock 'n' 
roll was The Rolling Stones in 1971 , 
and I loved it. I don't like all rock 'n' 
roll. I like Patti Smith, Van Morrison, 
Aerosmith, some of Guns 'N' Roses, 
some of Peter Gabriel and Stevie 
Wonder. I like only one song from the 
Prince-."Purple Rain." 
What do you plan to do after 
the tcu? 

Point Music asked me to do a new 
album mixed with Western music. 
I' m still not sure about it. I want to 
follow the role of Brian Jones. I keep 
traditional music tirst. It 's not ruined 
because I built a bridge between West-
ern music and Jajouka music.

Bite: Maximillian (Eddie Murphy) threatens Julius (Kadeem Hardison). 

Bloodsucking in the Bronx 
Eddie Murphy's versatile Vampire 

By Dan Okada 
Guardian Reporter 

O>median Eddie Murphy and horror guru 
Wes Craven fonn an unusual alliance 
to create Vampire In Brooldyn, an 
original projecllhal attempts to keep 
audience members both frightened and 
laughing. 

Although vampires and horror are 
nothing new for Craven, and comedy 
is Murphy'strademark- neitherCra-
ven nor Murphy had previously 
stepped outside of his usual genre. 

Murphy portrays the role ofMaximillialf, the 
very last of a particular clan of vampires origi-
nating from Egypt. He must seek out his female 
soulmate so he can create new progeny. In a 
unique twist on traditional vampire tales, Murphy 
- who wrote the story upon which the film is 
based - creates a history line in which all 
vampires originated from Egvpt. According to 
the history presented in the film, most vampires 
migrated to Europe, but Maxi milian belongs to 
a clan which travelled south. 

The role of a vampire is entirely new for 
Murphy, who has typically portrayed comic 
heroes in films such as The Goldell Child. 
Murphy 's role can be likened to his role in 
Comillg To America, as he plays his character 
with a regal quality one might expect from an 
ancient vampire. O>i ncidentally, Vampire pro-
vides Murphy with his tirst opportunity since 
Coming ToAmerica to play multiple roles withi n 

the same film. He plays a memorable scene as 
Preacher Pauly, as well as a small-time Italian 
Mafia hood, Guido. 

Maximillian begins his quest from 
an island in the Caribbean, via a de-
caying freighter. After he arrives in 
Brooklyn, he knows he has found his 
mate when he sees NYPD detective 
Rita Veder (Angela Bassett), who is 
assigned to investigate Maximillian's 
killingspree while also being unaware 
of her ties to his line of vampires. 

Maximillian, however, instantly 
recognizes Rita and uses his overwhelm ing cha-
risma and charm to seduce her into entering an 
eternal existence by his side_ 

Bassett (Whal's Love GollO Do Wilh II?) 
does a tine job of playing the role of Rita, 
showing how her character is torn between 
choosing a life of eternal power versus continu-
ing her current mundane existence. 

To aid in his quest, Maximillian employs 
Julius (!<adeem Hardison) as his ghoul retainer 
(servant). Hardison, best known for his roles in 
White Mell Call '/ Jump and the TV series A 
Differellt World, consistently provides macabre 
laughs as hi body rots away. 

Vampire succeeds in melding theart of com-
edy with horror. I n fact, the movie wi II often 
provoke laughs when revulsion shou ld actually 
be the more appropriate response. 

Vampire ill BrooklYII is playing at theaters 
throughout San Diego.

PHANTOM: Play has 
enough pathos to carry it 
Continued from P81&e H9 
filled and eloquent scenic design. Sure, the 
staircase in the masquerade-ball scene is a 
little more rickety, and the chandelier is a 
little smaller. With the exception of a cav-
ernous space which seems to eat up the 
diction and clarity of much of the dailogue 
and singing, the Civic Theatre production is 
nearly identical to its larger, more expensive 
predecessors. 

Because Lloyd Webber's music keeps 
essential characteristics from each of his 
plays intact, the true differences between 
each work stem from the type of plot. With 
a plotline which has proven to be successful 
many times over, "Phantom" employsa tried-
and-true approach which seems to mirror 
the Disney method. 

The SIOry begs us to idenlify with the 
Phantom - a person destined to live in the 
vaults of the Paris Opera House because he 
does not match sociely ' s definition of beauty . 
II is this audience-characterconnection which 
has added to the play's longevity and profit 
margin. 

Any analysis of the story would reveal a 
weak plot, because it is the spectacle of the 
show which gives it impetus. The main story 
weaves its way in and out of three opera 
productions recreated in spectacular detail. 
These plays are purposely awful, a brilliant 
comedy device exemplified by such instances 
as a fat tenor tottering on a life-sized repro-
duction of an elephant, and a cuckolded 
husband scratching his crotch and chortling 
in the corner. The audience is privy to the 
tirades of the resident diva, as the Phantom 
takes a disliking to her. 

The numerous sets are all well-designed, 
while at the same time, Phantom's transi-
tions are utterly seam less - further empha-
sizing the quality of the production as op-
posed to the plot. 

However, even the set is flawed at one 
crucial point. Uke tbe helicopter in "Miu 
Saigon" or thebUricade in "Lea Miserablea,-
the amount of publicity surrounding the 
chandelier makes its eventual crashing to 
the floor less than a surprise. In facl, the 
ascent of the chandelier from Ihe stage 10 the 
ceiling when the play begins seems more 
amazing than its anti-climactic, overly pub-
licized descent to the floor. 

In examining the different actors from 
production to production, the quality of the 
cast seems to be improving. While Michael 
Crawford had an elegant dignity throughoul 
the show, even after his unmasking, Rick 
Hilsabeck - of the current version - al-
lows himself none of this prolection. 

A life-long dancer, Hilsabeck has an 
athletic approach to his performance, and he 
has a beautiful singing voice which does not 
shortchange anyone, such as his "Music of 
the Night" power ballad. 

Sarah Pfistrer, who portrays Christine in 
the San Diego production, is given many 
beautifu1 songs to sing but not asked to do 
much else. Lawrence Anderson dutifully 
performs the role of Raoul, as he makes the 
best of some bad blocking (walking away 
from Christine on one line only to run back 
into her anns on the next) and carries the 
brunt of Charles Hart's banal lyrics ("Chris-
tine, Christine, / You don't have to, / They 
can't make you "). The rest of the 36-person 
ensemble is strong. 

The show walks a tightrope between 
pathos on one side and bathos on the other; 
it is up to each audience member to decide to 
which side he or she will faiL However, the 
tears shed and the standing ovation given at 
the end of every "Phantom" performance 
reveals that audiences are nol as cynical as 
most theater productions 'assume they are. 

"Phantom of the Opera" runs through 
Dec. 9 at the Civic Theatre. Student rush 
tickets are available prior to curtain at all 
shows except Friday and Saturday nights .

Greta 
This is Greta! 

If this band's name is based upon 
an actual female, she must be a gor-
geous schizophrenic. Greta's prob-
lem is not with producing good 
music; rather, it is its inability to 
stick with any style. The band plays 
beautiful melodies with skill, emo-
tion and driving rock; and the two 
styles often collide head-on in the 
same song. The rhythm-changes 
within the songs aren't necessarily 
bad, but they happen a bit too often. 
The deaths of a close friend and a 

roadie, both of which occurred on 
dates when the band was opening 
for ex-drummer Brad Wilk's Rage 
Against the Machine, may contrib-
ute to this uncertainty. However, 
true to form, the band contrasts trag-
edy with humor: "Can you imagine 
what would happen if we toured 
with Rage?" jokes bassistJosh Gor-
don, "The population of LA. would 
be cut in half by the time we got 
back." (Mercury Records)

Standford Prison Experiment 
The Gato Hunch 

Stanford Prison Experiment's 
second LP is an incendiary collec-
tion of power riffs and hurricane 
rhythms which kicks off with 
~You ' re a Vulgarian," and doesn't 
let up until the last song, "Worst 
Case Scenario." The band, based in 

L.A., has toured with The Jesus 
Lizard and Rage Against the Ma-
chine. Although S.P.E. hasn't 
reached the napalm level of those 
two bands, it can still hold its own.

Pairing David Bowie with Nine

you consider Bowie's career in the 
mid and late '70s. Then, Bowie pushed

Reznor screamed curses at 
the audience. Bowie offered

Reznor pushes rock's boundaries in a 
similar manner, but in a performance 
which featured Nine Inch Nails as the 
opening act (and supporting band on 
four songs) for David Bowie at the 

a mannered "good evening" 
and "good night." In short, Reznor's 
performance was the visceral stuff 
that makes live rock performances 
memorable, and Bowie's set was a 
polite, bland routine that rarely over-

came its self-indulgence. 
NlN began with the griHy "Ter-

level of intensity throughout the 11-

instruments. 

Bowie's old material went over 
the best. With the exception of "We 
Prick You," songs from his latest al-
bum, Outside, didn't generate mu~h 
energy. "Under Pressure" was a 
crowd-pleaser but, coming at the end 
of his set, it was too little, too late.

New Orleans Funk 
Harry Connick, JT. brings his new 

band to RIMAC on Sunday 
By Jeff NIeMI 
Hiatus Editor 

Playing a deranged serial killer in 
the new thriUer Copycat may seem to 
be a stretch for Harry Connick, Jr. 
After all, in his last role, the clean-cut 
piano player from New Orleans felt 
uncomfortable doinga bedroom scene 
in Jodie Foster's LiuJe Man Tale. 

"I think if I had to do that again in 
Little Man Tale, I actually would," 
CoMicksaid. "My coMcience isclean 
knowing that I didn't violate any of 
my standards. It was a completely 
innocent scene, and I didn't do any-
thing [sexual). I have no desir.e to do 
anything sexual on screen. As far as 
the violence goes, if it's non-gratu-
itous, pertaining to the script and done 
in a fairly tasteful way, then I think I 
can handle it. I think it was like that in 
Copycat. I didn't end up shooting 50 
people or anything." 

In addition to his acting career, 
Connick continues to tour and record 
and will play with his funk band at 
RlMAC on Sunday. Often labeled a 
younger Frank Sinatra, Connickstud-
ied piano with jazz musi-
cians like Ellis Marsalis 
and James Booker. He re-
corded with a big band 
for the first time on the 
soundtrack to Rob 
Reiner's romantic com-
edy, When Harry Met 
Sally. 

Connick's latest al-
bum, She, represents a 
departure from his roots, 
particularly in that it sounds more like 
a rock release. But Connick said he 
isn't worried about losing his long-

time fans . 
"I think I'vemaybealienatedsome 

fans, but I think they also 
realize that I'm a musi-
cian; and if they have any 
sense about it, they will 
know that 1 haven't aban-
doned that music. This is 
just another part of my 
personality ," Connick 
said, emphasizing that 
even when he played big-
band music, he drew a 
young, college audience. 

Juggling a movie and music ca-
rcer, as well as finding time for model 
Jill Goodacre, h~s recently pregnant 

wife, may seem like a lot for one 
person to handle. Yet, Connick main-
tains that even though his schedule 
might seem busy, it's really not that 
hectic. 

"It sounds like a lot, but it's nol. 
There's time off in betwcen. I end up 
working less than someone who works 
from nine to five. My marriage comes 
first on my list. We get plenty of time 
to see each other," he said. "I don't 
really have any long-term goals. 1 just 
take it a day at a time and try to 
improve myself as a musician." 

Connick will perform at8 p.m .. on 
Sunday at RIMAe. For more infor-
mation, call 220-TIXS.

Women's Soccer 

The UCSD women '5 club soccer 
team is leaving for Las Vegas today 
to compete in the National Colle-

giate Soccer Associa-Q tion(NCSA) Regional ~)) Toumiment this Fri-~ day and Saturday. 
UCSD earned the 

right to attend this event by finish-
ing second in the NCSA's Western 
Division with an overall record of2-
1-2 Especially encouraging were 
the wins against NCAA Division III 
Concordia (MI) and, most recently, 
cross-town rival SDSU. 

"It was a great experience play-
ing Concordia," team captain Angel 
Lopresti said. "It gave us confidence 
knowing that we dominated against 
an intercollegiate NCAA team." 

After a fruStrating tie in its first 
game against SDSU on Oct. 22, 
UCSD came out S.unday and domi-
nated, DOtching a convincing 5-3

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
win in ill regular-season finale. 
UCSD felt they should have won 
the first game as well, but its many 
great shots were turned away by a 
former Division I (SDSU Aztec) 
goalkeeper. 

Rachel Fogelhut, UCSD's lead-
ing scorer, found the back of the net 
twice in the first showdown with 
SDSU, but her goals were answered 
each time by state. 

In the rematch, UCSD was led 
by the play of forward Christine 
Lee, who knocked in I header for 
the team's third goal, and she as-
sisted on the eventual game winner 
with a beatiful crossing pass to 
Becky Bernard. . 

"We're coming together as a 
team," Coach Keith Michaelis said. 
"Our victory over SDSU showed 
just that. I'm looking forward to 
more wins in Las Vegas." 

In two gamesagains! Long Beach 

SI. (LBSU), UCSD played well 
enough to win but came up short 
both times. In the season opener, 
UCSD dropped I heartbreaker, 2-1. 

In the second meeting, UCSD 
settled for a tie. The San Diegans 
bombed away on goal in the first 
half, but only scored once on a left-
footed 'shot from Karlyn Clifton. 
LBSU answered with two quick 
goals before the end of the half, 
taking a 2-1 lead. Katie Piroutek 
added the tying goal for UCSD dur-
ing a frantic second half. 

UCSD will definitely be tested 
this weekend, as two of its oppo-
nents, Utah St. and last year's NCSA 
champion, Weber, are making the 
jump to Division I next year. 

The top two teams from this 
weekend's regionals will go on to 
nationals on Nov. 19 in Phoenix, 
AZ.

Rugby 

Smll.: Joe "Happy" lange spins a ball out to the back line 
during UCSO's game against North County on Saturday. 

With one tournament win un-
der its belt, the UCSD rugby team 
faced off against a more experi-

enced North County 
men'sclubteam last 
Saturday at Warren 

West Field. How-
ever, UCSD was 

unable to c.ontinue their unde-
feated season, as they lost a see-
saw battle to the North County 
club by a 17-13 score. 

UCSD, suffering from a slow 
start, allowed the North County 
team to charge out to a quick 5-0 
lead, which they maintained un-
til the end of the first period. 

In the second period. however, 
UCSD's enthusiasm and play im-
proved, eventually leading to a 
great run by Jesse Sheibley, which 
evened the score at five apiece 
going into halftime. 

During the secQnd half, the 
UCSD squad put its second team 
into the game, and continued to 
hold its own. 

The North Country team 
struck first in half number two, to 
take a 10-5 lead in the contest. 

But Andrew Wilga stole the 

lead back for the La Jolla squad, 
when he broke away for a scor-
ing run and converted a penalty 
kick to make the score 13-10, 
where it remained until the late 
going. 

UCSD was nearly able to put 
the game away when Chigo 
Uzutowe stole the ball and ap-
peared' to be on his way for a 
score. 

The teams's hopes were 
crushed, however, when a North 
County defender made a game-
saving tackle. The collision was 
enough to knock Uzutowe un-
conscious. 

That great play by the North 
County squad allowed them to 
win the contest with a last-minute 
surge, 17-13. 

UCSD's team fought hard, but 
there is "plenty of room for im-
provement," senior team mem-
ber Mark Bazzett said. 

The men's rugby team will 
next test its skms against the 
club team from Camp Pendleton 
this Saturday at 1 p.m. on War-
ren West field.

[Waltz]. It's always a hard game for 
us against [Cal Lu] because they are 
out to beat us. " 

The half ended with star sweeper 
Diana "Dirty Di" Muchowski clear-
ing dangerous balls which seemed 
to find their way into her zone. 
Pearson came up big again with one 
minute left in the half, when she 
once again stoned Gallegos on an 
open shot from 20 yards out. 
Muchowski and her fellow fullbacks 
played a great game, allowing only 
three shots on goal. 

"There's going to be a lot of 
mistakes out on the field [when the 
conditions are like this J, so we had 
to work as a team more," Muchowski 
said. "Our fullbacks did a great job." 

Cal Lu came out in the second 
half determined to knot the contesl. 
UCSD's forwards, however, kept 
the Regals in check, making counter-
attack runs during most of the half. 
Ele Johnson and Pugh were at the 
heart of the Triton offensive attack, 
setting up their teammates with sev-
eral golden opportunities.

game at five - when junior Chris-

A see-saw battle ensued, with the 
Crusaders holding a slim advantage 
throughout. Point Loma called a

to do the trick, as the Crusaders 
closed out the UCSD team, 15-12.

a great give-and-go play between 
Puah and Lauren Johnson {reed 
"Wheels" (Pugh) down the middle 
of the field, but her shot went wide. 

Trojans Topple Tritons, 14-10 
The Tritons fi nally notched their 

second tally of the game at 64:04, 
increasing their lead to 2-0 on a 
Lauren Johnson goal from the right 
side of the penalty box. 

Amanda Johnson's perfect 
throw-in from the center line led Ele 
streaking down the left side. After 
hurdling a Regal defender, Ele 
crossed a low missile to an awaiting 
Lauren Johnson on the other side of 
the box. Waltz could only watch her 
team's hopes fade, as the ball sailed 
into the back of the nel. 

The rest of the game seemed 
trivial until the last few minutes, 
when Ele Johnson got taken down 
by a Regal defender, and - in the 
process - she twisted her ankle. 
Her status for Saturday's affair in 
Minnesota is not yet known. 

The Tritons could certainly use 
her speed, as they travel to SI. Peter. 
But, UCSD does have experience. 

"We have a lot of girls that have 
been there before; and when you go 
up there, it's a toss of the coin. 
We've had to do it every year, and 
we'll go back and hopefully do it 
again," McManus said.

With a schedule drenched in 
Division I powerhouses, one would 
think that a Division III water polo 

team woufd be over-
matched in most of 
its contests. 

Unless the team 
in question is Head 
Coach Denny's 
Harper's UCSD 
water polo squad. 

Ranked eighth in 
the nation, the Tritons (12-11) met 
number one-ranked USC last night 
at the Canyonview pool in front of 
roughly 100 water-logged fans. In 
a tight contest, the Trojans came 
away with a 14-10 victory. 

"USC has an exhorbatant bud-
get for water polo," Harper said of 
the Trojans' Division I program. 
"They have five full rides to dis-
tribute among those guys." 

The Tritons may notgiveschol-
a",hips, but they too have some 
good players, such as John 
Giulianotti who scored the game's 
first goal, when he launched a two-

poi nter past the Trojans' goalkeeper 
during the first minute of play. 

The lead was not to last, how-
ever, as the visitors garnered one 
goal a minute later, and then went 
up, 3-2, when Simun Cimerman 
put in a two-pointer. 

It was only after another USC 
goal that the Tritons were able to get 
going on offense again. Mike Nalu 
lofted a pass to Adam Bollenbach on 
the left wing, who deposited it past a 
charging Trojan goalie to draw UCSD 
within one, 4-3. 

They were unable to draw any 
closer, though, because USC added 
three more points - a two-point 
lob and another score - to build a 
sizeable 7-3 lead. 

The period ended at 7-4, when 
Nalu poured in his first of four 
goals for the contesl. 

The Tritons managed to draw 
within striking distance during the 
second period, receiving scores 
from Nalu, Doug Cole and Steve 
Hom, while holding their adversar-
ies to a mere two goals - thanks in 
part to netminder Joe Welsh, who 
had seven saves in the game. The

half ended with the Trojans cling-
ing to the tighl9-7 edge. 

'lbe game stayed close through-
out the third period, with each side 
managing three points. UCSD was 
able to break USC's defense by 
passing around the perimeter, look-
ing for the open shot. Carlos De La 
Barra scored the final point of the 
period when he threaded a shot 
between his defender and a stuMed 
goalkeeper, and it appeared the 
holne team might have the mo-
mentum necessary to catch its foe. 

Unfortunately, the Tritons hit a 
dry spell in the fourth, getting shut 
out, while Southern Cal put up two 
more tallies, accounting for the 
14-10 final. 

Despite the defeat, Harper was 
pleased with the way his team per-
formed, both in yesterday's con-
test against USC and Sunday's 
game versus UCLA. 

"If we go out with that kind of 
effort and determination, we'll be 
tough," Harper said, in reference 
to the upcoming conference tour-
nament. "This is the best we've 
been all year."

NCAAs: UCSD hosts 
ftrst step toward soccer title 
ContInued from PIlI. 20 

UCSD begins playoff action this Saturday 
versus unranked University of 51. Thomas 
(MN) It Triton Soccer Stadium. The contest 
begins at 1 p.m. 

" It 's obviously a plus [to be at home]," 
Triton Head Coach Derek Armstrong said. 
"We were prepared to go to Chapman, but it 's 
great to be home. We know the field, and 
we 've got the same shoes on that we' ve been 
wearing all season, instead of changing [be-
cause of different field conditions]." 

"[To play at home] is a huge advantage for 
us," Fong said. "Not having to travel is big, 
and it 's especially important because wedon 't 
have to get used to a new time change." 

The Saturday contest between the Tommies 
and Tritons will be preceded by a showdown 
between seventh-ranked Chapman Univer-
sity and 22nd-ranked Colorado College at II 
a.m. The winners of these opening-round 
games will go at it on Sunday (1 p.m.) to 
crown the regional champ, who will earn a 
trip to the quarterfinals versus the Oreat Lakes 
Regional Champion. 

This year's team boasts a deep bench and 
astingy defense. Any combination of 16 play-
ers has been seen on the field this season, 
adding diversity to the tcam's attack. 

"Off the bench, 'Turbo ' [Minh) Nguyen is 
playing really well," senior midfielder Nick 
Terlecky said. "Shane Ferber is also going to 
have a good playoff for us." 

UCSD has been well-known for its strong 
defense, and the 1995 squad is no differenl.

The UCSD Ouantiln 

Senior Kenny Bums provides the needed lead· 
ership in the sweeper role. He is flanked by 
fellow senior Mati "Chili" Chilton, who is 
well-known for his scoring prowess. Chris 
Siok, Jay Newcomer and Blake Thompson 
solidify the backfield, which prevents shots 
from reaching freshman goalie Jason Reynoso. 

"I think most of our chemistry is in our 
defense," Terlecky said. "There has been a 
consistency in our defense this year. You' ll 
find that [Armstrong) will rotate our forwards 
a lot, but the defense haS stayed the same." 

The Triton offensive attack is also well-
balanced this year. Erik Waldman - the 
Tritons' leading scorer - leads a talented 
group of forwards with seven goals and three 
assists. Ferber, Nguyen, K. Christopher Fuji 
and Chris Braga round out the talented front 
line. Juniors Nate Hetherington, Brian Turner, 
Joel Kosakoff and Fong have controlled the 
middle of the field all season long. 

Hetherington's speed sparked numerous 
goals from the right side. Kodakof and Fong 
use their excellent ball-handling skills to 
spread the ball around in the middle of the 
field. Moreover, Brian Turner has chipped in 
with three goals and four assists, utilizing his 
size and strenght. On the left side, Chilton's 
muscle creates plays for the forwards, making 

of the field. 
"Weare definitely strong from both sides," 

Fong said. "Probably a little bit more power 
on Chili's side, and on [Hetherington's] side, 
we've got more finesse and speed. It's a big 
part of our team to have the scoring balance." 

Advancing through this year's playoff tree 
will be as difficult as it has been in previous 

Thursday, November 2. 1995 

years. No tcam will have an easy go of it. 
"When you look at our bracket, you've got 

tough games all the way through," Armstrong 
said. "The whole damn bracket that we're in 
is tough. Looks like we're on the tougher end, 
but that's the playoffs; you have to play every-
body eventually." 

the Tritons equally dangerous from both sides Scorln, punch: UCSO's Erik Waldman (4) was the Tritons ' leading scorer this year.

Tritons Soak Regals, 2-0 
MOVING ON: UCSD topped rival Cal Lu, 2-0, on a rain-soaked field 
in a first-round NCAA game, earning a trip to regionals in Minnesota 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

Even with sloppy field condi-
tions, a possible chance of contin-
ued rainfall and rival California 
Lutheran University hungry for a 
victory, nothing could stop the 
UCSD women's soccer team. 

The Tritons advanced to the 
NCAA Regionals in St. Peter, Min-
nesota, with a 2-0 de-
cision over the 
Regals of Cal 
Lutheran on Wednes-
day night 

UCSD now trav-
els to the Gustavus 
Adolphus campus 
this weekend to battle 
Washington Univer-
sity (MO) in the re-
gional championship semifinals. 

The rain from the past few days 
created a slippery field during 
Wednesday's contest, which 
forced UCSD to play more of a 
control-type game. 

tions are going to be horrendous, 
but we'll live with it." 

The Regals came out quickly 
in the first half, getting off a shot 
at the Triton net by the 4: 12 mark. 
Senior goaltender Kelly Pearson 
was ready to play, however, snag-
ging the shot from Cal Lu's star 
forward Jill Gallegos to keep the 
contest scoreless. 

The Regals 
would not even 
come close to scor-
ing the rest of the 
half, while UCSD 
went to work on 
garnering its first 
goal. 

Two minutes 
after the 
opposition 's first 

shot attempt, junior forward Ele 
Johnson took the ball down the 
right side of the field. After get-
ting enough room to cross the 
ball, she curved a right-footed 
cross towards the penalty box -
but a streaking Carin Pugh was 
not able to head the incoming 
pass into the net. 

PauInI fancy: UCSO's Ele Johnson (6) centers a ball during the Tritons 
2'() victory. Johnson had an assist but suffered a late game injury. 

"It made foran exciting game," 
Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "This is pure 
heaven [compared] to what we are 
going to play on Saturday. [It's] 
going to 'be a mud-bowl. The ball 
is not going to move. The condi-

Crusaders March . Back For Victory 
COLLAPSE: UCSD started fast against Point 
Lorna but fell in five sets on Wednesday night 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

On Wednesday night, the lone 
senior on the UCSD women"s vol-
leyball team, Angelle Crochet, was 

honored before the 
Tritons' match with 
Point Loma. 

And, for two 
games, UCSD put on 
a show to celebrate 
the all-American's 
departure. However, 
_~a_ in a scenario that has 
become all too familiar to the Tri-
tons, the Crusaders came marching 
in to steal the final three games and 
the match from UCSD. 

In the opening game, Crochet's 
clutch, late-game performance gave 
lJIe Tritons the win. With Point Loma 
closing in on UCSD, who was lead-
ing9-S, Crochet ripped a well-placed 
set from sophomore Sherine Ebadi 
down the heart of the Crusad~r de-

fense, evoking memories of the 
spikes she commonly hit before this 
injury-plagued season. Crochet then 
stepped up to the service line and 
fired off six straight serves, which 
shortly became Triton points, giv-
ing UCSD the victory, 15-5. 

Game two saw UCSD fall be-
hind early before shifting the mo-
mentum in its favor. During an 11-
point stretch, the Tritons captured 
10 scores, highlighted by a vicious 
spike from Mieke Biesheuvel. That 
streak handed the Tritons the vic-
tory, 15-10, and staked UCSD to a 
seemingly secure, 2-0 lead. 

However, games three, four and 
five became yet another painful re-
minder of what the Tritons seem to 
lack: the ability to put teams away. 

"We have a penchant for not be-
ing able to get the job done," UCSD 
Head Coach Doug Dannevik said, 
after his team's second collapse in 
as many home games. "It's that killer

pass toward the goal, but Cal Lu' s 
Amy Waltz used her S'11" frame 
to snag the shot, preventing the 
Tritons' first score. 

UCSD's pressure finally paid 
off at the 18:04 mark, as Carrie 
Peer's individual effort won her 
team a penalty kick. Reaching for 
a ball at the middle circle, Peer 
headed upfield while fending off 
two Regal defenders. Losing her 
balance twice, Peer kept surging 
forward, and as she passed the 
last defender, Waltz came out of 
the pen in an attempt to stop her. 

Peer dribbled around the Cal

out and tripped her in a last-ditch

Hayungs then marched up to the 
awaiting ball - spotted eight 
yards away from the center of the 
goal- and rifled a right-footed

ing UCSD a 1-0 lead.

Becoming a national cham-
pion takes a lot of skill and a bit 
of luck. The Triton men's soccer 

team certainly has 
the skill, and it is 
hoping that some 
luck will come its 
way as the NCAA 
playoffs begin. 

Seventeenth-
ranked UCSD im-
proved its record 

to t 1-4-2 with a dramatic 2-1 
overtime victory against Divi-
sion I rival UC Irvine on Sunday 
afternoon. The Tritons now look 
to carry the momentum from an 
eight-game unbeaten streak into 
this weekend's NCAA West Re-
gional competition. 

"We are going into [NCAAs] 
strong," junior Chris Fong said. 
"Hopefully, we can carry the 
momentum all the way through."
