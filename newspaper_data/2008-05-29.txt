Four Campus Eateries to Close Their Doors
By Christina Homer
Senior Staff Writer 

Beginning this summer and 
extending through next school year, 
Sierra Summit, El Mercado and Plaza 
Cafe will be temporarily shut down 
for extensive renovations, while Club 
Med will close permanently.  

Although UCSD’s Facilities, 
Design and Construction depart-
ment has not yet set a firm date, 
the John Muir College dining halls 
— Sierra Summit and El Mercado — 
will close during the summer so that 
renovations may begin on Stewart 
Commons. Following the comple-
tion of Muir’s renovations, construc-
tion will begin on the Revelle College 
dining hall, Plaza Cafe.

Club Med, the Medical School 
dining facility, will be closed for 
good and torn down at the end of 
August to make space for a new 
medical school building that will be 
erected on the dining hall’s current 
site within the next 22 months. 

“The renovations are needed to 
replace the 40-year-old facilities that 
are becoming costly to continue to 
repair,” Associate Director of Dining 
Services Steve Casad said in an e-
mail.  “Both facilities are also being 
designed for [the Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design] 
certification.”

One of the campus’ key facil-
ity boards unanimously approved 
a resolution protesting new poli-
cies that regulated operations of 
University Centers businesses and 
alcohol sales during the Sun God 
Festival.

Members of the University 
Centers Advisory Board, which 
oversees central campus areas such 
as Price Center and Student Center, 
stated in the resolution that A.S. 
programmers and administrators 
bypassed them when composing 
and implementing policies for the 
festival’s new format. 

Former UCAB Chair Matthew 
Bright, who authored the docu-
ment before he vacated his posi-
tion last week, said that the board 
was never informed of or includ-
ed in discussions regarding new 
policies, which this year included

claim they were grossly 
overlooked in planning of 
new festival.

and restrictions on alcohol sales 
at Porter’s Pub and Round Table 
Pizza.

“It’s upsetting that UCAB was 
not consulted at all about topics 
directly related to its responsi-
bility as the board that manages 
University Centers,” Bright said. 
“It’s not too much for UCAB mem-
bers to expect simple consider-
ation.”

The policies enacted a two-drink 
maximum and prohibited the sale 
of pitchers at the two campus eat-
eries. Bright said he had no qualms 
about the nature of the policies, 
but decided to present the resolu-
tion in protest of how policies were 
implemented.

The Sun God Planning Report, 
which programmers and admin-
istrators used as a touchstone in 
creating the event’s new structure, 
posed a number of recommenda-
tions that included early closure of 
Price Center. 

Bright said that there were sev-
eral instances of non-communi-
cation with UCAB, including one

The University of California has 
filed a request for a temporary restrain-
ing order with the Public Employment 
Relations Board against the union that 
represents the university’s roughly 
20,000 patient-care technical and ser-
vice workers in an attempt to bar a 
two-day strike that employees over-
whelmingly supported in a vote last 
week. 

University officials announced 
Tuesday that the union — the 
American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees — has 
failed to bargain in good faith in the 
last 10 months, and that the workers it 
represents are crucial to public health 
and safety at the university’s five medi-
cal centers.

“The university continues to be 
available for any further discussions 
to achieve an acceptable compromise,” 
said Howard Pripas, UC executive 
director of labor relations. “However, 
we are obligated to take this action to 
protect our patients and the commu-
nities that rely on UC medical centers 
for vital services.”

Nicole Savickas, human resourc-
es and labor coordinator for the UC 
Office of the President, said the strike 
would compromise the hospitals’ level 
of patient safety in case of an emer-
gency. 

“It’s a drain on our resources,” she 
said. “We know how important both 
our patient-care technical and service 
employees are to the functioning of 
the university, and the big concern 
is that if there is some kind of an 
emergency, we’ll need our patient-
care technical employees on site at the 
medical centers.”

AFSCME Local 3299 President 
Lakesha Harrison agreed that patient-
care technical employees play a vital 
role in the university’s workforce, 
but urged university officials to shift 
their focus to the long-term effects of 
below-market wages, which she said 
have produced dangerously low work-
er retention rates.

“It’s interesting how all of a sud-
den we’ve become very important to 
the university,” she said. “If they really 
value our work, they need to give us 
the contract. If they really care about 
patient care, they will try to retain 
workers for the long haul.”

Negotiations between AFSCME 
and the university regarding contracts 
for patient-care technical and service 
staffs have lasted 10 and seven months, 
respectively. UC patient-care techni-
cal employees have been without a 
contract since September 2007, while 
service workers’ contract expired in 
January.

Savickas said the strike will not 
influence contract negotiations.

“The fact of the matter is the strike 

is just going to have negative effects on 
patients and communities,” Savickas 
said. “It’s not going to affect bargain-
ing. In order to effect change in bar-
gaining, we need to continue to meet 
with the union.”

Bargaining teams represent-
ing both worker units met with UC 
officials late last week and AFSCME 
attended a mediation session with the 
university on Monday, but the union 
has still refused to accept any of the 
university’s contract proposals. 

According to Savickas, the uni-
versity’s most recent offer — which 
includes nearly $25 million in com-
bined wage increases in the first year 
of the contracts — would bring wages 
for patient-care technical workers up 
to market-level.

But Harrison questioned this 
calculation, calling the figure insuf-
ficient.

“They neglected to say what $25 
million means,” she said. “It means 
nothing. We’re always ready to talk 
and negotiate, but we’re not going to 
accept anything that’s not going to 
provide what we need to provide for 
the patients, that’s not going to retain 
the workforce, that’s not going to get 
our workers out of poverty. We have 
to have a contract that accomplishes 
these things.”

Harrison cited a May 23 statement 
released by UCOP, which said the uni-
versity has contingency plans in place 

for strikes.
“They said they have the basics 

covered, and they put out information 
saying, ‘We have a plan; it’s going to 
run smoothly,’” she said. “So, do they 
have a plan or not?”

She added that patient-care protec-
tion teams on the strike lines will be 
prepared to enter medical centers if 
additional assistance is required.

“We’re right outside,” she said. “If it’s 
a true emergency, we’ll know about it.”

PERB is expected to respond to the 
university’s request for a restraining 
order by the end of this week.

Two UCSD Graduates 
Found Dead in Home
The bodies of five family mem-

bers were discovered inside their 
San Clemente home this past 
weekend including two UCSD 
graduates, their parents and 
grandmother.

Authorities found twins Grace 
and Margo Ucar, 21, both of 
whom graduated in March with 
bachelor’s degrees in biology, 
and Fransuhi Kesisoglu, 72, in 
the first-floor bedroom.  Manas 
Ucar, 58, and Margrit Ucar, 49, 
were found near two handguns 
and may have been dead for up 
to three weeks, which made the 
bodies difficult to identify, police 
said in a statement.  

Autopsies began this week, but 
officials will not establish a cause 
of death until toxicology test 
results are completed.  Deputies 
found no sign of a struggle inside 
the home, said Lt. Erin Guidice in 
a statement.  

Quitting Smoking May 
Improve Social Health
A new study conducted by 

researchers from UCSD and 
Harvard University suggests that 
cigarette smokers are increas-
ingly left out of social groups, 
and the decision to quit smok-
ing prompts family members and 
friends to collectively give up the 
habit. 

UCSD associate professor of 
political science James Fowler 
and Nicholas Christakis from 

Harvard Medical School analyzed 
changes in smoking behavior from 
1971 to 2003 in a social network 
of 12,067 people. 

The researchers show that 
smoking behaviors are subject to 
social-network effects, and quit-
ting smoking spreads through the 
network like a house of cards 
collapsing.

“When you look at the entire 
network over this 30-year period, 
you see that the average size of 
each particular cluster of smok-
ers remains roughly the same,” 
Fowler said in a statement. “It’s 
just that there are fewer and 
fewer of these clusters as time 
goes on.”

UCSD Extension Director 
Named Regents Adviser

The University of California 
Office of the President has elect-
ed Edward L. Abeyta, the regis-
trar and director of academic ser-
vices at UCSD Extension, as next 
year’s staff adviser-designate.  

The staff adviser position will 
represent campus staff and non-
Senate academic employees by 
participating in open sessions of 
the UC Board of Regents com-
mittees.  

“Given the numerous chal-
lenges currently facing the UC 
system, the staff advisers play 
a critical role,” Abeyta said in a 
statement. “I look forward to serv-
ing as an ambassador between 
the regents and staff as we work 
together to evolve UC to continue 
to serve the needs of the state of 
California.”

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND



Penny Pinching Aside, Council Approves Pool Party

Amatter of social conscience figured prominently in last night’s A.S. Council meet-
ing, although the idealism later gave 
way when attention shifted to the 
grim reality of financial restraint.

The council considered a reso-
lution condemning the May 15 
U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement raids in which federal 
agents detained workers from a local 
bakery and searched a graduate stu-
dent’s on-campus apartment. The lan-
guage of the resolution focused on 
preserving human rights for “all people 
in the San Diego community” and 
urged Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to 
endorse the resolution’s conclusions.

Thurgood Marshall College soph-
omore Yuki Murakami implored the 
council to pass the resolution during 
public input. 

“We need to remember that the 
law doesn’t necessarily represent what 
is best for humanity,” he said. “This is 
just a new form of discrimination.”

The resolution, the first to come 
out of this council’s Committee on 
Campus and Public Affairs, was met 
with strong council support but con-
tained some grammatical barriers that 
needed to be reckoned with first.

After councilmembers sifted 

through botched capital letters and 
rogue quotation marks, they passed 
the resolution to applause. They later 
considered a finance bill, the discus-
sion of which revealed one of what will 
likely be many questions throughout 
their term of funding philosophy.

The council debated the appro-
priateness of allocating a few hun-
dred dollars to partially fund a pool 
party that the Freshmen Council will 
be hosting this weekend. Freshman 
Senator Eli Pessar said the event 
needed additional funding from the 
A.S. Council because college councils 
had been reluctant to each fully fund 
one-seventh of the event. 

The reasoning behind the finan-
cial reluctance of the college coun-
cils was oddly reminiscent of lan-
guage from last week’s budget meet-
ing. According to Pessar, since the 
Freshmen Council is part of the A.S. 
constitution, the college councils 
wanted the A.S. Council to fund a 
larger portion of the event.

Compare that to last week’s meet-
ing, when the council eliminated 
the funding of college festivals, 
down from $21,000 the year before. 
The reason, many councilmembers 
argued, was that college festivals were 
the responsibility of individual col-

leges, and not an A.S. obligation.
Decreased funding to college 

councils will likely make them less 
able to fund events for student orga-
nizations, although the situation at 
last night’s meeting made it clear that 
the A.S. Council itself can also expect  
less in return from the councils.

Whatever the cause, Pessar made 
it clear that the event, with a total 
budget around $1,500, would need 
more support from A.S. That led to 
a surprising amount of debate when 
some councilmembers at last night’s 
meeting donned their cost-reduction 
goggles and searched for unsuspect-
ing hot dogs and beach balls to cut.

“Can we just fund them, please?” 
said an exasperated All-Campus 
Senator David Ritcherson after 
growing weary of the debate. 

The question put the debate in 
perspective and cleared the way to 
the council’s eventual funding of the 
event.

addressed in the past. 
Allen, who proposed the creation 

of the committee, found that matters 
concerning students and alumni rarely 
made it to the regents’ table. He referred 
to the recent student outcry over the 
board’s decision to raise student fees, 
saying that when it came time for bud-
get cuts, issues concerning student lead-
ers and alumni usually sat uncomfort-
ably high on the chopping block. 

“I’m hoping that this committee will 
create an environment where student 
affairs, campus life and student and 
alumni questions are prioritized by the 
regents,” Allen said.

According to Allen, before the com-
mittee was established, students were 
only able to voice their concerns to 
the regents during the public opinion 
phases of the board’s meetings. At such 
forums, students are typically given 
only a limited amount of time to speak 
and interact with the regents. Allen 
said he believes that the introduction 
of the new committee will remedy this 
situation by giving a small group of 
regents the task of handling student 
life and therefore allowing for more 
meaningful interaction between regents 
and students. 

“The committee will provide a less 
antagonistic form of student engage-
ment,” Allen said. “I hope that the com-
mittee will be a way for us to build a 
more healthy student and administra-
tive relationship.” 

UC Committee Founded to 
Facilitate Student Input

▶ COMMITTEE, from page 1 Allen also said that the committee 
will focus on creating a loyal alumni 
base. According to Allen, the universi-
ties that have the most engaging and 
loyal alumni are often the universities 
that have actively dealt with and worked 
to improve the issues concerning stu-
dent life and experience. By engaging 
current students on a more personal 
level, Allen hopes that the commit-
tee’s actions will provide incentives for 
alumni to give back to the university in 
the future.   

Although the committee has yet to 
show whether it can fulfill its goals, UC 
Student Association President Louise 
Hendrickson said she thinks the com-
mittee is a step in the right direction. 

“The goal of the committee is to 
prioritize student issues, such as men-
tal health, academic prep and funding, 
which has always been supported by the 
UCSA,” Hendrickson said. “Someday, I 
hope that the committee will become a 
full standing committee with decision-
making powers.”

The committee is scheduled to con-
vene for two years, during which it will 
serve as an advisory committee with 
the student regent acting as an advisory 
member. After the two-year term has 
passed, the Committee on Governance 
will consider recommending the com-
mittee to be established as a permanent 
body.

weeks before the festival. 
In addition, Bright said he was 

unaware of Price Center’s early clo-
sure until he walked past it the day 
of the festival and found it empty. 
In the planning report, released in 
October, programmers recommend-
ed that the facility close at 6 p.m. to 
improve security management. 

However, Bright said he was 
never contacted about the new poli-
cy or invited to any of the debriefing 
and steering committee meetings 
that followed the report’s release.

Bright said that some UCAB 
members were upset by the poli-
cies’ impact on the pub and gradu-
ate students, who compose a major 
portion of the eatery’s patronage. 

Festival admission for gradu-
ate students was $35 — the same 
charge for alumni, staff and fac-
ulty admission. Combined with 
the restrictions enforced on UCAB 
facilities such as Porter’s Pub, the 
price of festival admission was a 
large deterrent on the pub’s alco-
hol sales further alienated graduate 
students.

Festivals Coordinator Garrett 
Berg did not respond in time for 
comment.

ing dining halls could potentially 
lead to bottlenecking, Casad said 
that the Revelle construction will 
not begin until Muir renovations are 
completed.

“We are very confident that we 
will be able to handle all of the stu-
dents on meal plans’ needs during 
this process,” Casad said. “Dining 
Services went through this same 
process with the renovation of 
OceanView Terrace in 2000.”

Many students are not that wor-
ried about the impact the approach-
ing changes might have on their din-
ing routines, but feel that the effort 

may be better 
directed toward 
other improve-
ments.

“A l t h o u g h 
it’s always a pain 
to be inconve-
nienced by these 
kinds of things, I 
don’t particularly 
mind Summit 
being closed,” 
Muir freshman 
Dan Shapiro said.  
“That being said, 
I wish Housing 
and Dining 

Services would spend more of its 
time and resources restructuring the 
system so that we get food that’s fast-
er, cheaper and, more importantly, 
better.” 

Shapiro added that the pres-
ence of other nearby dining options 
should lessen the strain of losing 
Sierra Summit. 

“Honestly, I don’t think I’m 
going to be that affected,” Shapiro 
said. “Plaza and OVT are still pretty 
close.”

Rating System is a standard used to  
judge the sustainability of a particu-
lar building.  In keeping with UCSD’s 
goal of environmental sustainability, 
the dining halls are being improved 
to meet this standard.  

Muir Provost Susan Smith said 
the Stewart Commons renovation is 
necessary to relieve the area’s prob-
lems with foot traffic during busy 
hours. 

 “My understanding is that the 
principal goal is to ease the conges-
tion that students now experience 
during busy times in the Stewart 
Commons,” Smith 
said. “Without the 
renovation, that 
congestion would 
be expected to 
worsen when the 
new Muir apart-
ments are built, 
adding approxi-
mately 275 resi-
dent students to 
the Muir campus.”

According to 
Casad, the Muir 
renovations will 
take 12 months 
to complete. The 
construction in Revelle is estimated 
to take up to 16 months.  

Casad said he does not foresee 
any major problems with the closure 
of these dining facilities.  

“As in the past, the other residen-
tial dining and retail facilities will 
have the ability to absorb the meals,” 
he said. 

Casad added that dining services 
will also add three temporary retail 
locations during the renovation peri-
od at Foodworx, North Campus, and 
Thurgood Marshall College in order 
to handle increased business.

OPINION
4

University property became the latest hotspot of the national immigration debate, 
after Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement agents stormed the 
apartment of a graduate student pur-
suing a tip that a suspect had fled 
there following an earlier raid of a 
pastry shop in Pacific Beach. 

Authorities came up empty 
handed at graduate student Jorge 
Narvaez’s residence at the nearby 
Mesa Housing complex, but the 
Pacific Beach raid was a small part 
of a bigger picture; the 18 workers 
detained by authorities at French 
Gourmet Bakery were only some of 
the 900 arrests made across the state 
as part of a sweeping, systematic 
crackdown. The three-week I.C.E. 
operation targeted criminals and vio-
lators of court orders, leading to the 
deportation of half of those arrested.

The unwarned intrusion of feder-
al authorities onto campus grounds, 
and subsequent violation of policy 
requiring universities be notified 
with a warrant, speaks to their brash 
fervor in the larger campaign. With 
or without a warrant, the complete 
failure to notify any campus-related 
entities about the raid leaves I.C.E. 
agents at fault for provoking a right-
fully shellshocked and angry commu-
nity. It may be true that the world of 

law enforcement precludes extended 
communication, but not even fed-
eral agencies should be above the 
simple courtesy of advance warn-
ing. Anthony Valladolid, director of 
Student Policies and Judicial Affairs, 
publicly offered a best-case collab-
orative scenario: university police 
could have detained any student sus-
pects before releasing them to I.C.E. 
officials. Valladolid’s example is a far 
cry from the way agents ultimately 
conducted the raid.

The scandal has rousted the 
community, with faculty, students 
and locals uniting in organized pro-
test of federal mistreatment of cam-
pus, student and immigrant rights. 
The debate over U.S. immigration 
policies is a fight to be had another 
time — in this case, the commu-
nity needs to focus on improving 
university oversight and supporting 
student privacy.

As a college campus, UCSD will 
naturally be home to a diverse com-
munity. And if prostitution, fraud and 
drugs are ever substituted for immi-
gration as a nationwide “issue of the 
week,” will federal authorities decide 
to bypass all relevant parties to break 
down the dorm door of alleged class-
by-day, street-by-night prostitutes? 
Or barge into a programming class 
to nab an alleged credit-card scam-

mer? Or launch a raid off a tip that a 
drug dealer is operating on campus? 
Considering the multifaceted I.C.E. 
operation has incited the invasion 
of on-campus property using a false 
lead, Narvaez and his supporters have 
a right to be concerned. 

UCSD officials are thankfully back-
ing on-campus safety and privacy. But 
when they are completely excluded, 
they are useless in representing stu-
dent interests. Federal authorities did 
not offer the least bit of consideration 
to the university in their recent raid, 
a ridiculous affront that damages stu-
dent rights and security.

The A.S. Council has exactly $1.21 worth of breathing room. That amount is what 
was left unallocated by council-
members in an excruciatingly tight 
budget forged from hours of back-
and-forth debate. With many orga-
nizations still clamoring for money, 
councilmembers concluded that 
they will most likely be forced to 
dip into the traditionally untouched 
reserves fund.

It’s a dark day for the council, 
which at this time last year was 
rejoicing in its unexpected discovery 
of a $200,000 surplus. Unfortunately, 
this year’s misfortune seems just 
as unexpected. Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani lauded the ease of the coun-
cil’s new online funding application 
system, which ultimately made the 
process so seamless that the council 
found itself unable to support the 
increased volume of student orga-
nization requests. Lakhani’s budget 
funds only about 30 percent of fund-
ing applications from last quarter 
and cuts $6,800 in funding to stu-
dent organizations.

Programming for student organi-
zation events face some of the most 
damaging cuts. The council’s finance 
office fielded more than $156,000 
total in requests from organizations 
to support their programming. The 
budget ultimately recommended 
spending a total of $65,000, a stag-
geringly smaller figure that does 
irreparable damage to some student 
organizations. The Undergraduate 
Investment Society will receive about 
$800 less than requested, meaning 
they will have to find financial sup-
port for their networking confer-
ences. Student Health Advocates will 
get a whopping $3,000 less than 
requested. The Vietnamese Student 
Association will get over $4,000 less 
than they wanted, the bulk of the 
recommendation weighing on the 
organization’s annual Vietnamese 
Culture Night. In on way or anoth-
er, students will undoubtedly and 
unfortunately feel the effect of the 
council’s financial problems. 

The budget also saw funds for 
college councils shrinking, with 
councilmembers eliminating the 
$21,000 line item for college festi-

vals. This will put even more pres-
sure on the council to support stu-
dent organizations that would have 
otherwise sought support from 
college councils for events such as 
Muirstock. 

Considering the long series of 
cutbacks to student interests, the 
A.S. Council needs to re-evaluate 
the amount of financial dedication 
it pays to staffing positions — funds 

that could have gone to college fes-
tivals were used for a staff program-
mer working through the University 
Events Office (at a $40,000 salary) and 
other increases in staff salaries (cost-
ing $13,500 total). Councilmembers’ 
decision earlier this year to create 
the events manager position is now 
proving rash as they find themselves 
scraping the bottom of their budget-
ary barrel.

Students the Biggest Losers in Council’s Bad Fiscal Picture

ILLUSTRATIONS BY BENJAMIN HOLM/GUARDIAN

After this year’s Sun God Festival, col-umnist Hadley Mendoza chose her most valuable players of the event. 
Now, Guardian staffers join in to offer more  
insight into the highs and lows of the new 
festival.

Best Holdover Tradition from Old Sun 
God Festivals:
Koala slip-and-slide at Sun God Lawn

The last bastion of the Sun God Festival 
took form midday when campus publica-
tion the Koala finally evaded security long 
enough to drag their tarp over Sun God 
Lawn and spray it slippery. Eventually, a 
crowd of wily near-nudes gathered at the 
top of the hill to launch face-first in drunken 
merriment; the heat increased, the group 
grew and more clothes flew off. Clad in a 
camo speedo, Koala member Kris Gregorian 
took great pleasure in spraying down stu-

dents with a hose and shoving wary sliders 
over the edge. Eventually, I relinquished my 
shoes, socks and valuables to the Sun God 
and dove Superman-style in enchanted glee. 
Again and again, dozens of enraptured stu-
dents sprinted up the hill to lose themselves 
to the slosh tarp of joy. To my damp com-
rades, I salute you.

Scariest Account of Bad Security:
Authorities errantly send student to detox

It seems rather pointless to add to the rant 
surrounding the terrible structure of this year’s 
Sun God Festival. Don’t get me wrong — I am 
in full agreement that programmers destroyed 
arguably the only tradition other than study-
ing that we at UCSD hold dear. Something 
more important happened that night, how-
ever, though it went sadly unnoticed.

Enter a friend of mine, a graduate student 
here at UCSD.  He had a good time on Sun 
God, and was even lucky enough to experi-
ence being handcuffed and thrown in detox 
for four hours.

The catch? He wasn’t drunk.
That’s right — there was not a drop 

of alcohol in his system, a fact that he 
repeatedly pointed out to the numerous 
officers present, thrice (thank you, college!) 
demanding a breathalyzer test to prove it. He 
was refused every time.

Now, as a critical reader, you are probably 
wondering why he was detained in the first 
place. According to the resident adviser at 
the Eleanor Roosevelt College dorms who 
called the police, he was “breaking curfew” 
since it was 1 a.m. Excuse me, but … what?

Welcome, friends and neighbors, to our 
new Sun God Festival. Have a good time, just 
remember to check your civil liberties at the 

gate. Oh, and feel free to drink as much as you 
want — you’ll end up in detox anyway.

Best Pre-Festival Rumor:
Tie, pillar of fire and Papa Roachillar of fire and Papa Roachillar

Part of Sun God fun comes before the festi-
val, when countless whispers swirl around cam-
pus about which bands could be possible acts. 
The title of “best” in this category could mean 
the most outrageous, hilarious or outlandish 
rumor spit out of the campus.

Papa Roach at the Sun God Festival proved 
to be one of the few rumors that was outrageous, 
hilarious and outlandish — all at once. Students 
flooded message boards and facebook walls with 
the possibility that the modern-day grungers 
were bringing new-age metal to UCSD.

Festival Planners Need to 
Rethink Programming Ethics
Dear Editor,

I enjoyed the Sun God Festival. 
But I enjoyed it far less than I should 
have. And that’s A.S. Vice President of 
Programming Kevin Highland’s fault.

I ran for A.S. president in 2005 on a 
platform of creating two Sun God festi-
vals. In the process, I learned about the 
festival’s history and the behind-the-
scenes scheming of the administration 
and the student government.  For 25 
years, the upper administrators have 
wanted to shrink the Sun God Festival. 
And for 25 years, the students have 
stood up to them — until 2008, with 
Highland’s heinous reign of terror.

Corralling students like cattle onto 
RIMAC Field, postponing the Junkyard 
Derby, draining the Price Center foun-
tain, selling too few wristbands, alleg-
edly installing radio-frequency identi-
fication chips in the wristbands to track 
our movements (according to one A.S. 
senator), charging some students $35 
to attend a festival they already paid for 
(but putting Highland’s friends on a free 
“guest list”) — these are inexcusable.

Also inexcusable was the $1 fee 
charged for credit card transactions at 
the Price Center Box Office.  Although 
retailers are allowed to offer a discount
for cash purchases, charging a fee for fee for fee
using a credit card is a violation of 
California Civil Code Section 1748.1. 
Highland sent out some half-hearted 
e-mails trying to portray the difference 
in price as a “discount,” but the Web 
site — and the facts — say otherwise.  
I repeatedly explained this to Highland 
and University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino, but they ignored all construc-
tive input, as is the custom at UCSD.

Students are legally entitled to a 
refund of the credit card fee. But they’re 
also morally entitled to their old Sun 
God Festival. I expect the new A.S. 
Council — and the new guy in charge 
of programming, Garrett Berg — to 
remedy both.

But just as outlandish were pro-
grammers’ early plans to install com-
plex pyrotechnics on RIMAC field, 
described to Guardian reporters as a 
“pillar of fire.” When they first pub-
licized the festival’s new format, pro-
grammers were throwing everything 
but the kitchen sink into their plans. 
It was obvious that 
they would not be 
able to include 
all of the features 
due to financial 
and staffing con-
straints, but the 
“pillar of fire” was 
by far the most 
exciting prospect. 
Now that would

Strongest Evidence That the New 
Sun God Still Has Soul:
Living Legends’ performance

If there is to be one act that comes 
to mind when thinking of Sun God 
2008, it most certainly has to be 
Living Legends. As students threw 
their hands up in the air in appre-
ciation, Living Legends tapped into 
the collective spirit of the crowd, 
allowing students to let loose and 

really enjoy their Sun God experi-
ence. The Legends reminded us of 
the uniqueness of any music festi-
val: that there is something power-
ful in the collective experience of 
live music, of bodies moving to a 
singular rhythm and the occasional 
wafts of marijuana smoke that filled 
the air from time to time. With 

few altercations 
in the crowd 
and relatively 
lax security, the 
Legends served 
as a reminder of 
prior Sun God 
festivals, where 
security was 
more relaxed 
and where stu-
dents, indulg-
ing in varying 

degrees of inebriation, could enjoy 
uninhibited fun. 

And so, while the Legends may 
not have been everyone’s top choice 
in terms of who was to play at Sun 
God this year, they certainly knew 
how to get the job done. Students 
dissapointed that their  favorite 
band wasn’t booked for Sun God 
found solace in the Legends’ easy-
going act, where the music — along 
with the good times — can flowed 
so freely.

This year, yours truly will be yet another Triton leaving the sea to pursue endeavors 
outside the comfortable predictabil-
ity of UCSD. Like a fish out of water, 
I will graduate as an anxious junior 
looking forward to ventures outside 
the often narrow-minded walls of 
the college where I have been learn-
ing for the past three years.

Yet I think I would be remiss not 
to reflect on my stay here and arrive 

at some conclusion as to how my 
vaunted “college experience” went. 
So here is my share of most memo-
rable moments; freshmen, you’ve 
been warned.

The collective experience of 
“Aleks as a Triton” started on a 
warm summer day in 2005. It was 
then that I decided to participate 
in the requisite “freshman orienta-
tion.” I seriously considered skip-
ping this summer-shortening event 
altogether but I was persuaded to 
attend nonetheless. And I appreci-
ated my friends for scolding me 
into attending, because it was at 
orientation that I ultimately learned 
that I was in this for the long haul.

My freshman and sophomore 
years were pretty much the same. I 
was cramming in economics class-
es and finishing arduous general-
education garbage, from which I 
gleaned nothing. Yet upon com-
pleting those pesky lower-division 
courses, I felt as if I had finally 
reached the crest of Mount Rundle.

Meanwhile, my summers were 
thrilling experiences; summer 
“vacation” took upon a whole new 

meaning now that I was a student 
at this school.

Starting in the first quarter of 
sophomore year, I couldn’t help but 
wonder why I was still studying 
here. Perhaps it was a result of my 
internship, which dealt with real 
financial issues that I viewed as 
more important in nature than my 
useless study of Francis Bacon’s butt 
in philosophy class. Moreover, I 
felt as though I was a drone taking 

some of my GE courses. I was, in 
essence, a note-copier, a student not 
necessarily learning anything but 
merely reciting information like all 
the rest.

If it weren’t for my fortunate 
preoccupation with the world’s 
economy, more specifically with 
monetary policy and the Gordon 
Growth Model, then I think I might 
have actually felt as if becoming 
a Triton was a complete and utter 
waste of resources.

Although the majority of my 
tenure here was a drab and perhaps 
ruthlessly plain waste of time, the 
fact of the matter is that I have, 
paradoxically, gained more from my 
dull experience here than I could 
have imagined. 

Immediately following my gradu-
ation, I will be employed in an arena 
that I find to be especially chal-
lenging and intellectually reward-
ing. It is a profession that hones in 
on the intricate relationships found 
between the fields of economics and 
the financial markets. Needless to 
say, I am quite excited about this 
endeavor because I will be able to 
do what I passionately love to do.

Nevertheless, for you newer 
Tritons, I wish you the best of luck. 
Though we both attend a rigid edu-
cation system that stifles learning 
and promotes the birth of drones, at 
least some of us emerge out of this 
centrifuge fully knowing what we 
want to do for the rest of our lives.

Swervedriver & Film School 

THE CASBAH / MAY 30 / 9:30 P.M. / $20

For some newfound nostalgia, look to 
the Casbah on Friday night and witness the 
reunion of a hearty dream-pop group from the 
early ’90s that you’ve probably never heard of, 
Swervedriver. 

After capitalizing on their nascent cult 
status by showcasing old tracks at Coachella, 
the pensive Brits have embarked on a full tour. 
Their repertoire ranges from textured shred-
ding with the pop mindset of Pablo Honey-era 

Radiohead (“Ejector Seat Reservation”) to a 
moodier Oasis template (“The Other Jesus”) 
that banks on big chord changes and electric 
thickness.

The comparably youthful Film School 
share the stage with their own derivation 
of Interpol’s modern angles mixed with a 
little California flair. Check out “Lectric,” a 
dark surfing hymn that rides on an ominous 
bassline and indiscernible phrases. (CK)

Filmed in 2006, the notoriously trippy and fantastical 
“The Fall” has finally gotten its big international debut. It 
tells the story of an injured 1920s stuntman spinning myths 
with a little girl, fact and fiction meshing right before their 
eyes. Unsure of how magnificently weird this tale will be?  
Think “The Cell,” the 2000 sci-fi flick that saw J.Lo running 
inside the mind of a schizoid serial killer.

“The Cell” director Tarsem Singh helmed “The Fall,” 
along with R.E.M.’s “Losing My Religion” music video (if 
that counts for anything), and is renown for not giving a 
fuck about story if it gets in the way of showing awe-inspir-
ing images. With finals looming, this mindbender might do 
the decompressing trick. (CM)

LANDMARK HILLCREST / OPENS MAY 30

A s a fan of the first three Grand Theft Auto games, I should have naturally been excited for the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, which promised to outdo previous titles with a more engaging storyline, 
more precise gunplay, better melee combat and more 
interactive environments. Yet I couldn’t get myself hyped, 
no matter how hard I tried. 

Of course, after playing the game I realized that it’s 
probably one of this generation’s best releases. But I was 
bummed. I’ve mentioned before on our weekly Hiatus 
podcast that, similar to the release of GTA IV, I also felt 
little or no excitement about the impending releases of 
the new Metal Gear Solid and Resident Evil, franchises 
that (like GTA) have been very dear to me. I thought that 
maybe as a gamer I’ve become jaded. Perhaps I’ve been 
playing games for so long that I could no longer appreci-

ate the innate joy that accompanies a blockbuster 
release. 

More 

recently, having caught Game Informer’s exclusive story 
on the new Prince of Persia title, I became genuinely 
excited. Although Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time 
is my all-time favorite game, I hated the sequels with a 
burning passion. The latest attempt promises a return to 
what made Sands of Time so special: a charming, mystical 
story and exotic, fresh art direction.

Reading the preview, I suddenly understood what was 
wrong. What got me excited for this new Prince of Persia 
was that, aside from everything that’s attributed to the 
namesake (mainly invigorating platforming mechanics), 
the game stands alone, with a brushstroke art direction 
not unlike Okami and influences of traditional Persian 
folklore to set the tone.

Now I realize that I haven’t become completely jaded, 
I’ve just grown tired of the generic sequelitis that’s plagu-
ing our industry. 

Video games today are not what they were 20 years 
ago. In fact, they’re not what they were five years ago. The 
industry is constantly moving in new and exciting direc-
tions, gradually becoming as engaging as other media, 
like films and graphic novels.

 However, due to the industry’s evolution, it now costs 
about as much to make a next-gen game as it would a film. 
The high cost devoted to game development exposes new 
and dire problems: reliance on existing franchises and the 
deprivation of creativity. With climbing costs, both pub-

lishers and 
d e v e l o p e r s 
have become 
more cau-
tious. Instead 
of taking cre-
ative risks, 
they tend to 
fall back on 
proven fran-
chises with 
t r i e d - a n d -
true mechan-
ics. This boils down 
to an alarming number 
of sequels and blatant copycats. 

Does anyone else find it rather ridiculous that Metal 
Gear Solid is now in its fourth iteration? Or does any-
one recall Dark Sector, the recently released third-per-
son action game that is Gears of War mimicry at its 
worst? Just the other day I saw some videos of a new 
survival-horror franchise called Dead Space that looked 
exactly like Resident Evil 4 in space. If games are merely 
building upon existing concepts, each a carbon copy 
of the last, is there really anything new to play or to be

FLAT FRIGHTS AND LAME LIV MAKE FOR AN ENDLESS
 NIGHT 

COURTESY OF UNIVERSAL

It’s impossible to intellectually critique “The Strangers” since critical analysis of garbage often proves futile. Reviews, in some sense, are supposed to help elevate or debase a film based on its pros and cons.  But when 
you’re already at the bottom rung and swimming in the cel-
luloid sewer, there’s really nowhere to go, not even down.

For the most part, audienc-
es try to remain reasonable. 
Essentially, the film follows a couple 
terrorized by unknown, masked 
assailants. For the first 20 min-
utes, the movie makes a big deal 
of describing the relationship 
between the two victims: James 

(Scott Speedman) has 

proposed to Kristen 
(Liv Tyler), who, not ready for marriage, 
rejects him. Now both are left to spend the night 
together in James’ summer home, where they’re to 
pout until morning. 

Unfortunately, they’re visited by masked crazies 
and are forced to spend the night fending them off. 
That’s about it, really. The rest of the movie is just the 
pair defending themselves. 

At no point does the couple’s relationship become 
a factor. The movie could’ve just as well started right 
before the assailants mount their attack. 

Considering that there’s no significant semblance of 
plot, any rational critique based on the film’s 

storytelling immediately flies out the door. 
Its hollow narrative leaves us to believe 
that any critique of the movie should be 
based on its “oh shit” moments. 

The movie starts out well enough with 
these, managing to genuinely surprise the 

audience a few times with moments of “oh 

shit, I see a guy in a mask in the corner of the house” or “oh 
shit, there’s a masked girl standing randomly on the street.” 

But these moments get old real quick. The first “oh shit” 
instances are shocking because 20 minutes of impossibly 
boring and pointless character development would leave 

anyone craving for any action. 
But once the shock and awe becomes a 

regular affair, the film stops being amusing 
and quickly becomes formulaic, leaving us 

wishing the victims would just die already.
While “Strangers” makes noble efforts to make the vic-

tims relatable, it’s hard to relate to characters too moronic 
for us to root for. If it’s 4 a.m. and you’re alone in the house, 
it would  probably be sensible to lock all the doors. Then 
maybe serial killers, burglars or “strangers” wouldn’t crawl 
in so easily.

THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  7

Also, when do the characters fight 
back? Three unarmed individuals, two of 
whom are frail women, and you have no 
desire whatsoever to attack any of them? 
Really? 

And did I mention the characters 
don’t lock their doors? It becomes rather 
painful to watch when the psychos dig 
through the victims’ garage and start 
to terrorize them with their own axe. 
Oops.

“The Strangers” is supposed to be a 

throwback to early 1970s slasher movies. 
That would be a legitimate statement, 
had the movie actually been a slasher 
flick. 

Any killing that occurs (at least by 
the assailants) happens at the end of the 
film, so throughout the entire duration, 
you’re essentially watching a game of tag 
between three clowns and two screaming 
morons.

It’s supposed to be scary, but it’s not. It’s 
not even campy. The film is “Peek-a-Boo” 
and “Scream” taken all too seriously.

excited for?
It’s this cold real-

ity that makes me 
wish Gears of 
War never exist-
ed. Having 
p o p u l a r i z e d 
the over-the-
shoulder per-
spective and 
cover mechan-

ic, now every-
body and their 

mother thinks it’s 
a good idea to cop 

the same fucking ideas 
in their games. Other 

games are even mimicking 
Gears of War’s drab and depress-

ing art direction; today I see more gray in 
games than I do on the ass of an elephant. 

Thankfully, a few developers still take 
risks, and there are a number of fresh games 
to look forward to. Aside from the aforemen-
tioned Prince of Persia, there’s Mirror’s Edge, a 
title that essentially promises to take the best 
elements of parkour (i.e. urban freerunning) 
and integrate them into a first-person experi-
ence.

Then there’s Left 4 Dead, a zombie-survival 

cooperative game that looks to bring back the 
joys of retro co-op (think Contra) to a whole 
new generation. There’s MadWorld, a myste-
rious game in the works from the creators of 
Viewtiful Joe and Okami. Taking into account 
their divorce with Capcom due to Okami’s 
poor sales, these developers have always been 
more inclined to take creative risks, which is 
reason enough to be excited for any games in 
their lineup.

If there are plenty of games to be excited for, 
why the hell am I bitching?  Unfortunately, the 
games I’ve just mentioned are only a handful 
among the long list of generic MMOs and first-
person shooters. 

Assuming these aforementioned games don’t 
sell well, publishers will no longer attempt to 
create new and exciting intellectual properties; 
it simply costs too much. Instead, what will be 
left is a large number of independent studios 
creating wacky and inventive games, which I 
support completely.

However, if the industry moves toward that 
direction, with big budget games taking less 
risks and smaller studios taking more, will we 
ever have refreshingly epic games like Metal 
Gear Solid was when it was first released? Per-
haps we’re moving in a direction where gaming 
is becoming more engaging, more cinematic, 
and telling better stories, but are we willing to 
see more and more games sacrifice creativity

H aving battled with a lethal bout of bilateral pneumonia in 2005, 
Spiritualized’s frontman Jason 
Pierce (aka Jason Spaceman) 
makes an ethereal recovery with 

Songs in A&E, taking after Pierce’s pro-
longed intensive-care stay in the Accident and 

Emergency ward. 
Throughout the hourlong LP, Spiritualized’s mesh 

of edgy psychedelia, trance rock, gospel tropes and 
ragged blues is powerfully harrowing and an eerily 

authentic impression of the disease-ridden singer on 
his deathbed.

Transcending the subject matter of ill-
n e s s and mortality in “Death Take 

Your Fiddle,” the prescience 
of convalescence opens up with 
slow, heavy, respirator-induced 

breathing — an ingenious 
cognitive trick that imme-

diately triggers images of 
a cold, forsaken hospital 

ward. 
While tackling the 

Herculean task of simple 
breathing, Jason laments, 

“Think I’ll drink myself 
into a coma … death 

take your fiddle/ 
play a song 

for me,” 
evoking a 
certain heavi-
ness as though 
our own blood is 
clogged with “mor-
phine, codeine, whis-
key.”

The acoustic main-
line and backdrop of oth-
erworldly instrumentals in “Sitting 
On Fire” is another beautifully provoca-
tive contemplation of life. 

Most impressively, the string quartet enters 
midsong and soars in contemplation, underscor-
ing Jason’s raw emotion with the line, “There’s an 
old flame that still burns in my heart.” Interspersed 
throughout Songs in A&E are also brief harmonies 
and interludes of driving percussion and gospel sing-
ers that reach into the dark, lonely corners of our 
hearts.

Although Spiritualized may have been inspired 
by heartrending tales of failing potency, Songs in 
A&E is blanketed with a renewed existential 
vigor that combats the mysterious sense of 
spiritual forlornness.

 Death Cab for Cutie
■ Narrow Stairs 
ATLANTIC

 Scarlett Johansson
■ Anywhere I Lay My Head 
ATCO

A fter signing with Atlantic Records, releasing their 2005 album Plans and being shoved into stardom’s spotlight, Death Cab for Cutie was 
keen on shedding the commercially tainted feel of 
their “Soul Meets Body” melodic pop for something 
more meditative. And their latest release is exactly 
that. Swapping earlier tunes of dreamlike croonings 
for sobering songs of empty relationships and a 
restless life, frontman Ben Gibbard drags his pierc-
ing voice across Narrow Stairs with bleak delibera-
tion — but trips over a few steps on the way.

The album’s debut single, “I Will Possess Your 
Heart,” opens with a four-and-a-half minute mid-
tempo section scattered with distorted guitar 
chords before Gibbard teaches an anticlimactic les-
son on patience: “You got to spend some time love/ 
you got to spend some time with me/ I know that 
you will find love/ I will possess your heart.” 

The problem is that Gibbard can’t even pos-
sess our attention, let alone our hearts — after a 
long-winded buildup that misses its energetic peak, 
his droning vocals just blur into the song’s dreary 
remainder. 

But what some songs lack in instrumental 

energy, they make up for with poetic lyrics. In 
“Grapevine Fires” Gibbard’s words wrap through 
somber piano keys and organ whispers to envelop 
listeners in his experience of the 2007 Southern 
California wildfires and invoke a surrendering 
reflection on the ruin’s hollow beauty (“And the 
news reports on the radio/ said it was getting 
worse/ as the ocean air fanned the flames/ But I 
couldn’t think of anywhere I would have rather 
been/ to watch it all burn away”) that reaches a 
powerful emotional ambiance.

While songs like “No Sunlight” and “Long 
Division” still maintain the catchy drum-drenched 
choruses reminiscent of past albums, they bear 
dark undertones that match Narrow Stairs’ affec-
tive maturity and force us to face a Death Cab that’s 
downplayed the cute and pumped up the death. 

Although Narrow Stairs is harder to swallow 
than Death Cab’s past poppy pills, its eloquent 
intricacy is proof that the band has uncovered a 
new depth to its body’s soul after all.

S carlett Johansson’s debut album, Anywhere I Lay My Head, features a medley of lackluster Tom Waits 
covers with what can be presumed to 
be Johansson’s own vocal twist. Despite 
an incredible amount of mockery prior 
to the record’s release, Johansson isn’t a 
total dud behind the mic.

Each song has a slightly eerie, near-
gothic touch, with pleasing melodies 
consisting of twangy guitars and slow 
beats that manage to hold the tracks 
together. The instrumentals fulfill the 
“indie” aspect of a Waits cover without 
too much effort, and with such a dreamy 
sound and a talented backing vocals 
(David Bowie joins on a few songs), 
these chould be hits, but the snag is 
Johansson’s own pipes.

A throaty, deep-voiced Johansson 
plunks through each verse in a manner 
reminiscent of a teenage boy singing 
Britney Spears in the shower, awkward 
and lacking the proper amount of spunk 

to sell itself. Johansson’s dulled voice 
leaves the songs sounding monotonous, 
despite the large amount of effort put 
into the production prior to her vocal 
additions. Waits’ gravely growl certainly 
doesn’t garner the kind of vocal praise 
exhibted toward American Idol contes-
tants, but he brings an essence to his lyr-
ics that Johansson can’t begin to touch.

The major sinker in the collection 
is “I Don’t Want to Grow Up;” having 
been successfully covered once by the 
Ramones, Johansson’s version has quite 
a bit to live up to. Her take imagines the 
track as an ’80s techno-pop throwback, 
with over-synthesized vocals and sounds 
that can only be described as “different.”

The album finishes where it started, 
with a soothing melody and a detached 
Johansson. At the very least, we can be 
thankful she didn’t cover Black Sabbath.

 Usher
■ Here I Stand 
JIVE

M uch was said about Usher’s Confessions four years ago, par-ticularly about the R&B sexpot’s real-life extracurriculars while bedding TLC’s Chilli. The talk helped heat up the 
singer’s now multi-platinum album as the genre’s second coming 
— its success was even credited with turning the tide of flounder-
ing U.S. album sales. 

But now, Usher returns from his four-year hiatus to a R&B 
scene packed with wannabes, where a twittering singer like Ray 
J scores a long-lived hit and Chris Brown runs wild with dancing 
that weak-knees the ladies. So what’s the returning King of R&B to 
do, improve on classic style or one-up the rookies?

Usher’s fifth album Here I Stand does a little of both. What stays 
of classic Usher is his all-encompassing voice, widely tuned to both 
pluck the heartstrings in bouncy ballads like “Something Special” 
and drain the lungs in power anthems like “Moving Mountains.” 
If one thing is certain, it’s that Usher knows love. The trick for the 
new father and husband is to get a handle on life after romance. 
Most of Here I Stand feels like the honeymoon, with Usher staying 
between the sheets to profess all kinds of airy, cuddly adoration. 

But Usher manages to pad down all the fluffiness with classy 
sheen, led by the recently released single “Love In This Club.” The 
two-parter sees Ush and Beyoncé Knowles overcome by their libi-

dos, with Young Jeezy joining in on regally elevated keyboarding. 
Critics have panned the ditty as simplistic, one-note trash, but for 
whatever overproduced club-friendliness hurts Here I Stand, the 
album recoups with smooth R&B authenticity that recalls the good 
ol’ lovin’ of ’90s Babyface. 

Even R&B singers, it seems, have to grow up. The Casanova 
of Crooners has vacated — this all-new Usher is an older, 
wiser softie.

THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

2-3 at the top spot and 8-8 at the No. 
2. His terrific play at the top of the 
Tritons’ lineup helped lead UCSD to 
a third consecutive appearance in the 
Sweet 16 of the Division-II National 
Championship tournament. 

“Our team had to deal with so 
much adversity throughout the season, 
and I’m glad we were able to make it to 
Houston for the team championships,” 
Rubens said. “Every year, my goal is 
for the team to get to nationals and 
have an opportunity to play with the 
best teams in our level. I was so proud 
we were able to do it all four years I 
was here.”

Over the course of his tenure, 
Rubens went 102-57 combined in 
singles and doubles, demonstrating 

his versatility in both formats. Last 
season, Rubens was named an ITA 
All-American for his outstanding 
doubles play, where he went 20-4, 
including 19-4 with Meister, who was 
also named an ITA All-American. 
His graduation will leave a huge hole 
at the top of the singles and doubles 
ladder for the Tritons, something 
head coach Eric Steidlmayer is very 
aware of.

“Eric Rubens will not be replaced,” 
Steidlmayer said. “In his time at 
UCSD, our team made the national 
tournament all four years, he won 
the Division-II doubles National 
Championship and was a fine player.”

of my T-ball days, but with more and 
more games under my belt as a softball 
spectator I realized that it actually made 
the game harder. Whenever playing 
third base in baseball, I was always a 
bit nervous having to play so close in to 
the plate, so I couldn’t imagine playing 
the hot corner in softball where you 
are given zero reaction time to make 
a play. The same goes for the middle 
infielders, and senior second-baseman 
Danielle Lukk, who showed off her best 
Chase Utley impression with a slew of 
diving stops.

Ditto for outfielders, who don’t have 
the luxury of time to track down fly 
balls and camp under them to make 
an easy out with such close fences. So 
when I saw freshman Katrin Gabriel 
slide headfirst into the leftfield fence to 
make an out, it only made me wish that 
ESPN cameras could have been there 
to let her grab some airtime on Baseball 

Tonight’s Web Gems. 
I’ve been told that a 60 mph pitch in 

softball is the equivalent to 90 mph in 
baseball, and as a pitcher who topped 
out in the mid 80s, I was blown away 
by seeing these girls hit off of pitches 
that, would seem to me like 95-mph 
sharp cheddar. Over the course of the 
season I was treated to a hitting clinic 
from the likes of senior Jenny Maze, 
juniors Allison May and Jenni Habib 
and freshman Sarah Woofter. 

In my prime I was known for my 
quality rubber arm and led my team 
in innings pitched, and even then 
the thought of pitching complete 
games on back-to-back days makes 
my elbow throb, forcing me to reach 
for the Icy Hot. It’s not uncommon 
for softball pitchers to throw both 
ends of a doubleheader and take the 
mound numerous times in a weekend 
series. Softball games go quicker than 
baseball, meaning that the pitchers 

have even less recovery time and 
always have a four-game series played 
over two days. For every catcher out 
there, two consecutive doubleheaders 
is beyond a nightmare, yet sophomore 
backstop Nicole Saari showed athleti-
cism that rivals anything in baseball 
by catching all but four innings over 
the whole season. 

Although the Tritons’ season 
ended in the NCAA West Regionals, 
they still had a phenomenal year 
and recruited at least one new fan. 
Whereas the arrival of spring has 
always meant the start of baseball 
season for me, I guess I can now tack 
on one more sport. It is almost cruel 
that by studying abroad in France 
next year, I won’t be able to watch 
the softball team so soon after having 
been introduced to the game. One 
thing’s for sure; next time some jock 
tells me that I throw like a girl, I’ll be 
sure to thank him.

Sportsmanship. Fonte was 12-8 in 
singles and 12-11 in doubles and was 
nearly impossible to beat in conference 
play, going 6-0 in singles and 7-1 in

had a 22-14 record, including 10-5 in

Eric Rubens has made quite a mark in his final season for the UCSD men’s tennis team. As a result, the senior has received many honors since the season 
concluded. 

Rubens was named the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association Senior Player of the Year in the West Region 
as well as the ITA/Arthur Ashe Award for Leadership 
and Sportsmanship. According to ITA, the Arthur Ashe 
Award is given to the player who has exhibited outstand-
ing sportsmanship and leadership as well as scholastic, 
extracurricular and tennis achievements. Rubens was one 
of eight players around the country to be honored.

Entering the 2007-08 season, Rubens was honored as 
the ITA’s Player to Watch in the West Region and responded 
by putting together a banner season in his final one as a 
Triton. He began the year by earning a spot in doubles with 
fellow senior Blake Meister to the ITA Indoor National 
Championships, a prestigious tournament in which Meister 
and Rubens were the only Division-II pair involved. The 
duo qualified by beating out some of the best doubles 
teams in the nation at the ITA Small College Super Bowl 
in October.

“[The season] started off so great,” Rubens said. “I 
mean, making it to the ITA National Championships at 
the start of the year was just so difficult. Beating the D-II, 
D-III and NAIA champions just to get there required a lot 
of luck and required so many tough matches that had to 
go tiebreakers.” 

As recipient of the Arthur Ashe Award, Rubens said he 
will now take pride in the sport for the rest of his life. 

“The sportsmanship award is definitely the one that 
will mean most to me,” Rubens said. “Out there on the 
court, you want to display character to all the other guys on 
the team. Being recognized for that is such a great honor, 
something I will never forget.” 

Rubens served as the captain of the men’s team, which 
recently finished the year No. 18 in the final national rank-
ings. But a humble Rubens gave credit to his teammates 
when asked about his leadership on and off the court. 

“I may have been captain, but other guys like Alex 
Whitmore and Ramesh Thondapu did a wonderful job in 
being good examples for the young kids,” he said. “I try my 
best to just lead by example.”

During the year, Rubens continued his dominance in 
doubles, going 16-7 in that department, while serving as 
the No. 1 or No. 2 singles player for the Tritons in every 
match. While playing singles, he went 10-11 overall, going

WOMEN’S TENNIS — Head coach Liz 
LaPlante has compiled a truly magnif-
icent resume during her 29 years at the 
helm of the women’s tennis program. 
Over the course of her career, she 
has led UCSD to national champion-
ships and incredible winning streaks, 
as well as earning individual hon-
ors. LaPlante added another award 
to her long list after being named 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association’s Coach of the Year for the 
fifth straight year. 

The 2008 season also marked the 
fifth consecutive year UCSD won the 
CCAA title after going undefeated in 
conference play, extending its confer-
ence win streak to 48 matches.

“I am proud of that streak, but it’s 
the NCAA postseason play that has 
the most significance,” LaPlante said. 

LaPlante has had success at that 
level, too, leading UCSD to four 
Division-III National Championships, 
most recently in 1994. The closest the 
Tritons have gotten at the Division II 
level was Elite Eight appearances in 
2002 and 2005. In 2007-08, the Tritons 
put together a 14-10 record before 
succumbing to the best team in D-II, 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii, in 
the tournament’s the second round.

LaPlante wasn’t the only Triton 
to be recognized for an outstanding 
effort this season. UCSD had five 
women make the All-CCAA First or 
Second Team, further demonstrating 
the stranglehold they have over the 
conference. Freshmen Kimmie Dao 
and Natalie Varnay and seniors Justine 

Ang Fonte and Molly Sullens were 
named to All-CCAA First Team, which 
exemplifies the great balance of youth 
and experience LaPlante had this year. 
Freshman Dalya Perelman was named 
to All-CCAA Second Team.

“It has been so great to have Justine 
and Molly on the team all four years,” 
she said. “They have played a sig-
nificant part in our success and I 
will really miss them. Both of them 
are so competitive and have worked 

extremely hard, and been great exam-
ples to this year’s team. Justine was 
team captain and made it her mission 
to make sure the freshmen under-
stood the importance of team unity 
for our success and it all wouldn’t have 
come together without her.” 

LaPlante has just as much to say 
about her young freshmen. 

“I’ve never had a stronger or more 
talented group of freshmen and it’s 
been great to see their progress, their 

improvement, the friendships that 
have evolved and how close they have 
become as a team,” she said. “It was 
challenging in the beginning just get-
ting everyone and get to know one 
another, but it’s amazing how they all 
came together. I’m really looking for-
ward to the coming years to see how 
this group continues to improve.”

Fonte received additional rec-

You throw like a girl!”Every kid who grew up playing baseball is accustomed 
to this playground taunt. Kids are cruel, 
plain and simple, and on the sandlot 
there were always a few players whose 
lack of athleticism and coordination 
never went unnoticed. These young 
ballplayers could not escape the verbal 
wrath of their teammates and had their 
every move mocked, constantly being 
reminded that they played “like a girl.” 

To be honest, I can’t remember 
which type of kid I was. I was a decent 
little slugger from an early age, so 
chances are that I leaned more toward 
the taunting than the receiving end of 
having my skills emasculated. Baseball 
was always a mainstay in my life, mov-
ing from fall ball to the official spring 
season to summer club leagues year 
in and year out. Anyone who has ever 
played baseball as seriously as I did, or 
even anybody who has ever known a 
ballplayer can probably attest to the fact 
that an inflated ego tends to go along 
with playing the sport.

That ego ran parallel to how we 
viewed other sports, thinking that the 
skill and finesse needed to take an out-
side fastball the other way or to chase 
down a sinking line-drive in the gap 
made our sport superior. This meant 
that we couldn’t help but look down 
on the savageness of football and the 
individuality of tennis and golf. And 
yes, this also led us to view our fellow 
diamond comrades, the female softball 
players, in a pretty condescending way. 

So when I received my assignment 
to cover the UCSD women’s softball 
team this winter, I couldn’t help but 
have some of my childhood prejudices 
carry over, regardless of how much I 
think I’ve matured over the years. Still, 
covering the softball team was my first 
choice and I was excited to cover a sport 
so similar to my beloved baseball.

Even then I still had my assump-
tions about softball. The field is so 
small, the base paths are so much 
shorter and, let’s be honest, each team’s 
roster is filled to the brim with women. 
Not to mention the fact that my buddy 
and I play homerun derby on the soft-
ball field left-handed and still knock 
some dingers out of the yard. How hard 
could softball be? 

I learned just how impressive the 
sport is the very first time I watched a 
Triton softball game. As an ex-All-City 
pitcher, offense isn’t exactly what catches 
my eye, and when my first softball game 
ever saw senior southpaw Melissa Ward 
throw a one-run, seven-strikeout com-
plete game against Chico State, I knew 
I hadn’t given softball its due credit. I 
might have shrugged off the sport if 
that first game had been a slugfest, but 
the fact that it was a classic pitcher’s duel 
made me realize that having to time a 
pitcher who is throwing from only 43 
feet away and hitting a ball that is trying 
its hardest to disprove gravity by actu-
ally rising must be pretty damn hard.

As the year went on, I only saw 
more and more reasons to tip my pro-
verbial cap to the hardworking women 
of UCSD softball. The smaller dimen-
sions of the field at first reminded me
