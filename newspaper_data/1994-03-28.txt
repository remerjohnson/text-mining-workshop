entering the fourth year of a state-
wide budget crunch, cutbacks and 
higher fees have begun to affect 
student enrollment. Last Fall, 
UCSD reported its first ever drop 

in enrollment. While all students have been affected, the 
rising costs of higher education have hit students of color 
particularly hard. 

The problem facing UCSD is one of diminishing num-
bers - the percentages of certain ethnic groups are plum-
meting dramatically. African-American students, for ex-
ample, comprised 3.1 percent of the university'S student 
body in 1982. In the span of 10 years, that percentage has 
dropped to 2.5. 

With the percentages falling, more people are beginning 
to examine UCSD's methods of recruiting underrepresented

Students 
Question 
UeAB 
Expenses 
By Alexander ThIesen 
StaffWr;ter 

Several UCSD student leaders 
are questioning expenditures by 
the University Centers Advisory 
Board (UCAB), particularly plans 
to send students and staff to the 
Association of College Unions-
International (ACU-I) conference 
in Hawaii. 

The UCAB, which operates and 
maintains the Price Center and the 
Student Center mostly through the 
use of a student-asses ed Univer-
sity Center Fee, had planned to 
send its chair and vice chair as 
student delegates to the confer-
ence in Hawaii, along with three 
staff members includi ng Univer-
si ty Centers Director Jim 
Carruthers. 

The costs of attending the con-
ference would have come out of 
the UCAB's $3 million budget. 

Accor~ing to Carruthers, the 
two students were to attend the 
conference as part of an informal 
search committee for a new assis-
tant director to the UCAB. The 
students were also going to learn 
more about the workings of stu-
dent unions. 

H.owever, UCAB Vice Chair 
Stacy Rothstein resigned as a del -
egate to the conference, claiming 
that the trip was an inappropriate 
expenditure of student-assessed 
fees. 

In a Feb. 28 letter to the UCAB, 
Rothstein said, "The professional 
side of the conference is neither 
essential nor geared toward the 
student leadership needs of our 
college unions. 

"I went to the regional confer-
ence and most of the stuff was not 
geared toward us," Rothstein later 
added. "I think there are so many 
better 'ways to spend our time. I 
didn't bring back enough to feel it 
was worthwhile."

MTV's Spring Break 
Rates a Mild Success 
EVENT: Local residents complain of crowds and 
traffic, but few are arrested at week-long festivities 
By EIIIlne C.IIIUH 
Associate News Editor 

As MTV folded up its tent after 
a week of taping its "Spring Break 
'94 broadcast at Mission Bay 's 
Mariner 's Point, both network and 
local officials expressed positive, 
if restrained, assessments of the 
event. 

" For an event of 
this size, it ran rela-
tive ly smoothly . 
However, it obvi-
ously had effects on 
th e community," 
said Carolyn 
Wormser, San Diego 
City Special Events 
Administrator. 

of- town college vacationers. The 
result, Accord said, was a less than 
wild atmosphere. 

Although cloudy skies persisted 
for the most of the week, atten-
dance surged to 35,000 over the 
weekend when the sun came oul. 

"When I was there earlier in the 
week it wasn ' t 
very sunny and 
the i e weren't 
many people, but 
once the weather 
got better on the 
weekend it was 
packed," said 
Marshall College 
junior Yanina 
Romero. 

" In the past few 
days we' ve been 
evaluating feedback 
from the community 
and it has spanned a 
huge spectrum, from 

MTV V .... ay Daisy 
Fuentes was In 
attendance for MTV's 
Sprlnc Break event. 

Bill Robinson 
of the San Diego 
Police Media Re-
lations Depart-
ment said the 

residents upset with the traffic and 
noise to businesses pleased with 
the profits it generated," Wormser 
added. 

Mission Beach resident Paula 
Dal mada, a University of San Di-
ego senior, said the event caused 
lrerpendous traffic problems in her 
area. Her neighbors had problems 
wi th vandalism from the crowds 
of people attending the event, and 
the noise from the combination of 
traffic and loitering people proved 
troublesome as well . 

"For people who were down 
here for spring break, I think it was 
really something special, but it 
was an inconvenience for us," 
Dalmada said. 

This year's spring break taping 
in San Diego, held March 8-14, 
marked a change in atmosphere 
from MTV's traditionally wild 
spring break programming, accord-
ing to MTV Publicist Scott Ac-
cord. 

" I think kids are probably a 
little bit more crazy in Daytona, 
because they come from allover 
for their spring break. In San Di-
ego, a lot of the kids were local, so 
they were in their own element," 
Accord said. 

For the past eight years. MTV 
has taped its spring break show in 
Daytona Beach, Florida. However, 
amid concerns that the rowdy 
crowds attracted by MTV were 
hurting the city's tourism indus-
try. Daytona Beach officials 
dropped the event. In search of a 
new location, MTV approached 
San Diego. 

The majority of the San Diego 
crowd was older than what MTV 
anticipated. and most were San 
Diego residents rather than out-

event 's impact on 
criminal activity rates in the area 
was "not that significant.'.' There 
were about a dozen arrests total 
for event-related activities, mostly 
for public drunkenness and mi-
nors in possession of alcohol. 
Robinson attributed the arrests to 
a shortage of police officers. 

"Any time there is a large gath-
ering such as this near the beach, 
extra police are needed. What was 
needed which we didn 't have, plan-
ning this as a one-time thing, were 
more officers to keep the event 
completely under control. How-
ever, if this event happens again 
next year, we will be better pre-
pa.red," Robinson said. 

Despite the few arrests, the 
crowd was fairly tame, accord-
ing to Romero. Restrictions 
against bringing alcohol into the 
event contributed to the more re-
laxed atmosphere, she added. 

"I'm sure people were drunk, 
but it was really controlled," 
Romero said. "There were a lot of 
people there at times, and it could 
have gotten out of control if drink-
ing had been allowed." 

And what about the future of 
M1V in San Diego? "Right now, . 
we don't know, "said Accord, add-
ing that the cable organization is 
now in the process of assessing the 
event. 

"Overall, it was very success-
ful, especially considering the 
large amount of people who at-
tended," Wormser said. "But, in 
evaluating the community feed-
back, we have to ask, 'Is this some-
thing the community wants?' We 
have to come to a balance between 
the benefits and disadvantages in 
order to make a decision about the 
future."

Regents Approve Fifth's New Name 
"t a meeting earlier this month, the UniverSity of 

California Board of Regents approved the renaming of 
Fifth Coilege for Eleanor Roosevelt, in recognition of 
her leadership in international affairs and as a re-
former in the areas of civil rights, human rights, labor 
and youth issues. 

Fifth College, founded in 1988, is distinctive in its 
international perspective and in Its rnission to prepare 
students to understand and function effectively in the 
global community of the 21st century. 

According to Fifth College Provost Jamie Lyon, 
Eleanor Roosevelt was selected for the new name 
because students felt she best embodiad the 
college's humanitarian spIrit and its pioneering, 
international approach. 

·After three years of effort to select a name, we're 
dellChted that the Board of Recents approved the 
name of Eleanor Roosevelt for our college,· Lyon said, 
"Of several excellent candidates, we believe that her 
decades-lq work in the International arena and her 
advocacy of global human rights best exernpllfy the 
Ideals of FIfth College at UCSO .• 

Roosevelt was a national~lzed leader In 
women's reform and national politics even before her 
marriage to Franklin Roosevelt. Durl'll her time as 
First Lady, she continued her political involvement, 
Intervenl~ with the State Department on behalf of 
Europe's .Jewish retucees, and 8I1ul'll .... nst the 
internment of Japanese Americans. 

After the president's death in 1945, Roosevelt 
remained one of the most effective women In Ameri-
can politics and was appointed chair of the U.N. 
Commission on Human Rights. 

The recommendation to name Fifth College In 
honor of Eleanor Roosevelt was the result of a 
lengthy discussion and nomination process that 
spanned more than three years, Approval by the UC 
Regents manes the final step in the renaming pro-
cess.

Performing with a European rock band isn 't the 
usual Wf1i that graduate students come up with ideas 
for their research papers. While enrolled in indepen-
dent study at the University of Barcelona in 1986, 
UCSD graduate student Maria Van Liew found herself 
doing exactly that. 

Van Uew, who speaks fluent German, Spanish and 
catalan, took up performing wtth the "sul>culture" rock 
band Eis Pets (The Farts), in Tarragona, Spain from 
1986 to 1990. She wrote a scholarly article based on 
her experiences titled "The Scent of Catalan Rock: Els 
·Pets' Ideology and the Rock and Roll Industry,· which 
was published In the November 1993 Issue of the 
BrItIsh journal, Popular Music. The article focused on 
the role of Els Pets in the struggle within catalonia to 
preseM the la'lluace and culture of the region.

BROWN: 
Candidate addresses 
higher education plan 
Continued from .... 1 
tion, adding that the University of 
California and the California State 
University systems need to ensure 
quality and accessibility. 

"We must have a system that is 
affordable. If we make higher edu-
cation unaffordableforourstuden1s, 
then we make it inaccessible for all 
but the privileged few," she said. 

Brown assailed the fee hikes 
that have become commonplace 
during Wilson's tenure as gover-
·nor. "We have a law on the books 
in California declaring that stu-
dent fee increases at UC and CSU 
must be moderate and predictable. 
But Pete Wilson has waived that 
law and argued for massive fee 
hikes," Brown said. " I want to 
enforce the law." 

Brown said that she would ex-
pand access to higher education 
through her Cal Loans program, 
which would provide $200 mil-
lion in low-interest loans for 
middle-class families . The Cal 
Loans program has been vetoed 
twice by Wilson. 

The Democratic front-runner 
added that colleges and universi-
ties can no longer operate as "a set 
of contesting fiefdoms" and must 
act more in the public interest.

A week after Rothstein's resig-
nation, UCAB Chair Aaron 
Goodman also resigned as a del-
egate to the conference, a move 
which some attributed to pressure 
from the Associated Students 
Council. 

"[Rotbstein)n:signcd. which was 
the correct thing to do, and she was 
praised forthat, " said AS. President 
Carla Tesak. "I think .. . that is what 
caused [Goodman) to n:sign."

. a reason for his resignation. "I 
didn't feel any pressure from the 
AS. In this particular case, this 
was a worthy conference ...• It wu 

ing to have to change in profound 
ways. They have to become more 
productive," Brown said. 

"There is so much more effi-
ciency that can be achieved," she 
added. "Our high schools ought to 
be a place where advanced place-
ment is used to a far greater de-
gree." Browl) alS'o called for the 
use of intera'Ctive technology in 
the university. 

When pre~sed by reporters 
about how sil.e would fund her 
programs, Brown did not provide 
any specifics. However, she did 
suggest that the salaries of top 
administrators should be cut. 

"I don't think the university 
administration should base com-
pensation on a corporate model," 
Brown said. 

Brown also blasted Wilson for 
his lacJc ofJeadership in higher edu-
cation. "The fmger-pointing and 
blafue-shifting has got to stop. The 

one of those things where the 
money could be used elsewhere, 
and 1 wanted to spend some time at 
home," Goodman said. 

According to Tesak, the AS. 
had been against the conference. 
Prior to Rothstein's and 
Goodman's resignations, thecoun-
cil had planned to vote against 
authorizing expenditures for the 
conference. 

Carruthers, however, defended 
the costs of attending the conven-
tion. "I think any time Hawaii is 
involved, there's a second look 
and 1 think that's unfortunate. 1 
think any time we can educate 
students how to be better decision 
makers, it's a wise investment," 
Carruthers said . 

"I don't look upon it as an ex-
pense. 1 view it as an investment, " 
he added.

STORY BY DOUG ALEXANDER OPINION EDITOR 

I e are not talking about free-dom of expression," said Dr. Robert T.M. PbilJips, 
deputy medical director of 
the American Psychiatric 
Association. "We are talk-
ingaboutprotectionofour 

children from pathology. This is pathology. 
This is a cause-and-effect relationship between 
what we hear and what we see and how people 
react violently in the street." 

These words, spoken last month at Senator 
Moseley-Braun's de facto gansta rap hearings 
("Shaping Our Respones to Violent and De-
meaning Imagery in Popular Music"), capture 
the overall tone of the event: somber, 
grave, apocalyptic, angry , Despite 
sharp dissent from several partici-
pants - perhaps most eloquently by 
Congresswoman Maxine Waters -
f9r many, the verdict on gansta rap is 
guilty as charged, 

Dr. C. Delores Tucker, founder 
and chair of the National Political Con-
gressofBlack Women, offered a similar 
argument for the danger of rap: "Re-
cently we have seen two incidents which 
vividly demonstrate the cause-and-effect 
correlation between what young people 
hear in rap and how they act." Tucker then 
told the tales of the killings, one a stabbing, the 
other a shooting. Both, she said, occurred while 
the assailants listened to America's favorite 
boogie-man: Snoop Doggy Dogg.

simple: violence is bred through popular culture 
- our music, our tiIms, our television shows, 
our books, our magazines. We are breathing our 
own refuse. 

The idea that aspects of popular culture -
expression, speech and ideas - are harmful, 
sometimes fatally so, bas gained a strong foot-
hold in the last several years. Some universi-
ties have banned hate speech, and academics 
like Mari Matsuda argue that such 

speech should not be 
comtitutionally protected. The religious right 
and MacKinnonite feminists continue to fight-
sometimes suc:cessfully - for the ~ of 
pornographic materials. After the "Cop-Killer" 
backlash, Tune-Warner dropped seveml"incen-

Television, whichissec-
ond only to gansta rap as 
the most destructive trans-
mitter of violence, has re-
ceived an extraordinary 
amount of attention in the 
last few years. We all know 
the sbodt statistic which is 
thrown around whenever 
thesubjectsofviolena:and 

of being the victim of "random" and "senseless" 
violence is the new American assumption. 

Though based more 011 image than substance 
(crime rates are high, but 00 more so than last 
year or the year before: or the year before that), 
this heightened awareness of violence bas both 
precipitated a public counterattack against 
America's most violent and a harsh backlash 
against the culture 0{ 1IioktIa. The pera:ption 
of encroaching anarchy demands more a pr0-
found explanation for vio1ence than the tradi-
tional "bad seed" thc:ories can offer, 

television converge: By the age of 12. the aver-
age child witnesleS 100,000 IdS of cathoid 
violena:. At first glance, these figures are as-
toundi... How could such an inundation of 
violent imagery could not affect a child? 

The problem with these figures, however, is 
what counts as "violent. " For example, a recent 
report on television violence from the Univer-
sity r:i Delaware included the 25th anniversary 
show of"uugh-In." How violent could Laugh-
In be? Under the IIIIIIC definition wouldn't we 
a1socharac:terize Bugs Bunny and Road Runner 

c:artoons IS excessively violent? Or what about 
the Three Stooges? 

Studies linking television and violence are 
also commonly invoked. A recent article in 
MOIher Jones, for example, claimed that there 
were "some 3,000 research studies of this is-
sue." Ac:x:ording to Johnatbon Freedman, writ-
ing in Psychological Bulletin, there are a total of 
2.500 studies on television. Of those, only 500 

make referena: to aggres-
sion and only 100 investigate 
the relationship between ag-
gression andtelevision. The ma-
jority of these are lab experi-
ments. All are of limited value. 

Whether we are talking about 
violent television and film, gansta 
rap or pornography, such "cause-and-
effect" questions are inherently diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to answer. How is 
"aggressiveness" defined? How is it quan-
tifled? And what does this ambiguous "ag-
gression" mean in the real world? Though 
we have more knowledge about television . 
than about pornography or rap, we still know 
next to nothing. 

But the question is not whether imagery and 
ideas affc:c:t us, but rather how they affect us. 
Although libertariam might claim that slice 'n' 
dice horror ftic:b, songs about wbac.ting cops 
and S&M 'zinea have no effc:c:t on us, this posi-
tion is almost • simplistic • the claim that slice 
'D' dice flicks, ~kiIlina rhymes and _p shots 
r:i gaaN and bound women cau.rr people to act 
violently. We are not islands of absolutely free, 
iadependent thought. I~ is similarly Hawed Io.y 
we can isolate a single cause-and-efJect for vio-
lent ads. The world is much more complex. 

Culture of violence explanations obscure 
more questions than they answer. By focusing 
011 pop culture as an immediate "cause" of 
violence, more important issues are relegated to 
the background, if not completely ipocecI. The 
kid who drove: a bullet through bia skull while 

listening to Ozzy Ozboumc:'s "Suicide Solu-
tion" wasn't ilL'lpired to pull the trigger because 
ota Ozzy's sensitive croon. He bad psychologi-
cal problems. CUlture of violence explanations 
move us away from understanding and plCvent-
ing violence. 

The "magic bullet" againstviolence becomes 
a matter of "cleansing" television, music, art and 
film. But determining what is "harmful" isnearly 
impossible and almost always dangerous. The 
pressure for regulation foF(%S "incendiary" art-
ists underground and pushes industries to en-
gage in "benign" self-censorsbip. And the push 
for outright a:nsorsbip, most prominently in 
pornography and hate speech, threatens to swal-
low everything in its wake. 

"We need to get away from male-centered 
notions of free speech," Mari Matsuda wrote in 
a recent issue of Ms. Magazine. "'The traditional 
First Amendment analysis ignores the effects of 
power and wealth differentials. Women do not 
oow have access to effective speech. We should ... 
say that pornography, sexual harassment, racist 
speech, gay-bashing. anti-Semitic speech -
speech that assaults and excludes - is not the 
same forms of speec:h deserving protection ... 
[S]ome people can't tell the difference be-
tween dissent and assaultive speech .• think 
we are capable of disoemment, and that is

Can we tell the difference? And tell 
the differenCe between what? What 
qualifies as "speec:b that ISIualts and

SHORING IN SEX OFFENDERS 
By .................. 
Sta" Writer 

The recent parole of serial rapist 
Melvin Carter bas whipped c.Jifor-
nians into a furor over justia: reform 
and the issue of what to do with sex 
offenders. The citizens of Modoc: 
County, where Carter was paroled. 
have been literally up in arms sina: 
his arrival. Carter, who confessed to 
committing over 100 rapes in a 10-
year period, wu convicted on 23 
counts of rape, assault, burglary and 
attempted burglary, and sentenced to 
25 years in prison. However, he was 
paroled after only 12 years bec=ause of 
accumulated credit forworlt and good 
behavior and ended serving less than 
one year in jail for each count on 
which he WIS convicted. 

The citizens of Modoc have little 
faith that jail has done anything to 
change Carter's behavior. The San 
FranciscoChrortickreported, '''Sina: 
yellerday, we've aoId 12 handguns,' 
said Ron Prevette, owner of the Sports 
Hut, where the sale of one pistol a day 
iscoosidered to be brisk busiaess. "In 
addition. there have been massive 
demonsbaIions of pan:nts demand-
ingprotedion from Carter. "Scoreaof 
pcopIe gatbered. •• 10 proIesI Carter's 
parole in their community. A demon-
stration. .. drew l,sol) people - more 
than bait the town," the Chrottick 
continued. 

Despite his jail time, many Cali-
fornians are still afraid that Melvin 
Carter and people like him will strike 
again. Many believe that the Califor-

niac:riminaljustic:esyllembun'tdooe 
its jobtostopcrime. Even tbcIe within 
the jusdce system acknowledge this. 
... quite bonesdy can't imape any 
place in the state that's not going to be 
in an uproar [over the parole of 
Carter)," said TIp KiDdeI of the De-
pertment of Comdions. 

Traditionally, the criminal justia: 
system bas dealt with sex offenders 
simply by incartlerating them for a 
few years. Currently, the average 
length of time a rapist serves is 56 
montm - less than five years. The 
average time a child molester serves 
is 38 months - hardly evefi three 
years. Once released, 63 pera:nt of 
these convicts' return to prisom for 
sexual assaulf within two years. 

Within the last few years, 
Califomia'spoliticianshave discusted 
new strategies fa change these statis-
tics. Lately, they have leaned toward 
giving these criminals even more jail 
time under such programs as "Three 
Strikes and Y ou'reOut. "Using events 
such • the release of Melvin Carter IS 
a polibcal tool, many politicians are 
procI'imingthal~sbouId locbway 
tbcserapislsandtbrow away theay." 

Politicians are DOt the oaIy ones 
with this altitude. Tbere is a statewide 
tendency to consider building more 
jails and being tougher 011 criminals 
as the answer to stoppingcrime. How-
evir, with this attitude, the issue of 
how to deal with sex offenders has 
been reduced to a short-term solution. 
Jailingtbem is Dot the answer. Weare 
spendingprmous time and energy on 

Asthesbde ...... 
to expand our 
prison facilities to 
..... with the Influx 
of lifers, It ..... to 
cut ...... prey •• 1Ion 
by 37 percent. 
a solution that will only protect us 
during the time that the criminal is 
actua1Iy in jail. 

The primary rational bebind"Tbree 
Strikes and You're Out" is the statisti-
cally ungrounded ISsertion that an in-
aease in imprisonment rates will de-
aease crime rates. This ignores the 
fact that California bas experienced a 
fourfold increue in incarceration in 
the pastdec:ade with no corresponding 
demase in crime. 

Fmancially, "Three SIrikes" plam 
are not viable. They wiU definitively 
put our budget priorities on building 
and maintaining peoal institutions at 
the expense of health, education and 
welfare programs that help to deter 

crime. At the same time that the state 
plans to expand our prison facilities to 
deal with the influx of lifers, it plans 
to cut rape prevention by 37 ~ra:nt 
and training for public prosecutors 
and public defenders by 44 percent. It 
also proposes to eliminate three youth 
programs and reduce six additional 
violence program budgets, including 
those for domestic violence, rape cri-
sis and child sexual abuse and exploi-
tation. 

As Caryn Brooks of the National 
OrganizationforWomen(NOW)said, 
"Our own governor is running around 
and proclaiming 'One strike, two 
strikes'likesome hysterical umpire at 
the World Series of Crime. Yet he is 
cutting services that might prevent or 
help the situation ... and ourcommuni-
ties." 

We need to develop a system to 
cope with sex offenders and potential 
sex offenders that are out in the streets. 
Spending our money solely on jails 
doesnotbingto protect us once the sex 
offeOder is out of jail and to help the 
victims of sexual crimes. 

I believe in stiff sentences for sex 
offenders. lenient sentences for the 
horrible crimes like those committed 
by Carter are simply unacceptable. 
However, the criminal justice system 
must also provide rehabilitation. The 
extent to which rehabilitation un' t 
used is astounding. The city of San 
Francisco, forexarnple, is eliminating 
all of its criminal psychiatric treat-
ment for a whopping savings of 
$800,000. 

This state has skewed priorities. 
For example, as part of his parole 
agreement, Carter is monitored at all 
times by three guards. Yet he has 
rea:ived little or no psychiatric treat-
ment. This just doesn't make sense. 
How can we, as taxpayers, justify 
allowing the state to spend so much 
money on guards and none on reha-
bilitation? 

The release of Melvin Carter is 
symbolic. Modoc could be any of our 
communities, Carter is just one ex-
ample of the ~300 sex offenders 
that are released every month on pa-
role in California. These men wander 
our streets, and we don't even know it. 
What will we do once Carter's parole 
is up three years from now? 

Most agree that Carter should never 
have been sentena:d to only 25 years. 
legal insiders know this means only 
one-halfofthesentence will be served. 
This is not only unjust, it is dangerous. 
It is well past time for the legal system 
to come clean about its discrimina-
tory sentencing practices in sexual 
assault. 

Something must be done to stop 
the Melvin Carters of this country , but 
"'Three Strikes and You're Out" poli-
cies are not the answer. As a commu-
nity, we should settle for nothing less 
than a zero-strike policy which fo-
cuses on prevention. We should 
strengthen the effectiveness of our 
prison system. Only by using a multi-
faceted approach to tbiscomplex pr0b-
lem will we ever truly prevent and 
curtail violence in our society.

COM~: Easy targets of political rhetoric get the shaft once again, but the blame game does little to solve any of the basic 
problems facing us. So, the question is, what do we make of fear-mongering politicians? 

THREE FLAIliNG STRIKES, WE'RE HYSTERICAL 
By Ely A.bul 
Staff Writer 

In 1990, Pete Wilson ran pledging 
to tune up California government 
Four budgets later, the Bear Hag Re-
public bears greater resemblance to a 
banana republic. It seems that Pete 's 
preferred tune-up tool is a baseball bat 
- with the occasional ax and cleaver. 
Four strikes, and thaI weasel damn 
well better be oul. 

The sad fact is that one of the 
Democratic contenders, John 
Garimendi, wants to make the death 
penalty the central issue of the pri-
mary campaign. He says it has some-
thing to do with philosophical vision. 
No need to fuss with such messy 
things as real campaign issues, when 
frying a few losers will make things 
all righl. 

The get-tough-on-crime hysteria 
seems to have overcome nearly every 
politician in state government. Five 
different "Three Strilces and You're 
Out" bills were passed by the Assem-
bly in 0fU! day - mob behavior if 
there ever was such a thing; some-
thing like dyslexic lemmings lunging 
for the nearest available cliff. The 
tragic part is that such procrustean 
feel-goodisadistic measures do little, 
if anything. to make the public safer 
and much to strangle funding for the 
few worthwhile things the state still 
does. 
. There are plenty of judges, pr0s-

ecutors and 1aw~nforcement types 
who recognize that "1brce Strikes" 
will undennine what they view as 

efficiency in criminal justice. like 
the mandatory minimum sentencing 

thatl~sIatorsinSacramentoandD.C. 
have been grinding out every time 
they want to look macho, "Three 
Strilces" will make for blinder justice, 
which is to say, more crass and arbi-
trary injustice. 

In particular, "Three Strikes"mea-
sures count property and drug crimes 
among "violent" or serious strikes. 
The result will be 10 i,!1lpact prisons 
beyond the objectively cruel crowd-
ing levels prevailing at present and 
necessitate the building of yet more 
prisons. Needless to say, sensible 
measures like ending the hysteria-
hyped war 00 drugs (no suocess story 
despite all the money thrown at the 
problem, largely through incarcera-
tion) are out of the question. 

Evidently, Pete liUs prisons. Per-
haps the agenda should be M Pete '94: 
Jail "But Pete doeso't like scl1ools-
at least not since be got his law degree 
tIuougb the University of c.Jifomia, 
gratis, as UC degrees were before the 
Gov. Reagan days. Yeah, so what if 
education is the best crime preventioo 
and, by the way, worthwhile in itself. 
Besides, if you can starve scbooIs into 
00IIlJ1Iete ineffectiveness, it becomes 
a simple mllter to convince voters 
that public education baa failed and 
radical-marketeer privatizatioo is the 
only solution-

If politicians were to address any 
of the basic causes of the malaise 
facing CaIifomia, they would find 
themselves at odds with int.ereslS ca-

pable of unseating them at the next 
election. Distractions thus substitute 
for issues, like bow budgets are to be 
balanced wbilestiJl se~vitalneeds. 
Having left the realm of problem-
solving, the goals are no looger really 
ensuring public safety or having a 
populationthatcanreasoo past a sound 
bite. That would, after all, interfere 
witbsaid intereslSand reelcctioo. Since 
simplistic, represaive measures recre-
ate the problem, the same flotsam will 
be a viable distraction during the next 
election, and the same bid medicine 
can be applied again during the next 
term. 

But we shouldn't give Pete more 
aedit than is due. "Three Strikes and 
You're Out" (sequels: 1'wo Strikes 
You're Out," "One Strike You're 
Toat") got its real IIIOIIlenIum DOt 
from Pete but from !bat dallUllibtral

lion bas tied its crime bills to health 
reform. The U.S. Congress (mostly 
squishy liberals again) is also well at 
work at churning out its own "Three 
Strikes" pabulum. 

So Wilson signed the toughest 
Three Strikes We're Broke bill he 
could get his dirty little bands on, 
while California sinks further into the 
red. To understand the full signifi- . 
cance of this move, we must recall 
that his proposed budget assumed 
(yes Toto, we are in California) that 
the federal government would pro-
vide over $2 billion to state and local 
governments to cover costs of immi-
gration. Without that payment, the 
state will very likely go bankrupt -
all before the effects of shoring up our 
title as the higbest-per-capita-incar-
ceratioo-rate-state. 

Unfortunately,ascribingWiIsoo's 
actions to delusion is too generous. 
There is trickery afoot. Pete's fiscal 
&bell game is devised to cast blame OIl 
Democrat Feds and the usual local 
scapegoats. Catoe the May revise,

good bate-mongering. 
The problem neither begins nor 

ends with Pete. Numerous Democrats 
have been quite complicit at many 
steps along the way. Wbile legislators 
were falling allover themselves with 
"Three Strikes," all of them are at 
pains DOt to raise taxes - at least not 
for anyone with enough clout to put 
them out of a job. Ain't none of 'em 
goona do squat to touch the distribu-
tioo of wealth. But Pete bas been a11-

t~r a hatchet-man: his "tuoe-
up" has meant a smaller state govern-
ment that makes fewer collective in-
vestments in the future, strangles 0p-
portunity for anyone DOt already on 
the higher ruogsofthe socioeconomic 
ladder, and is increasingly geared to 
repressive measures. 
. Criminal offenders and undocu-
mented immigrants are easy marks. 
Few want to appear either sympa-
thetic toward or soft OIl criminals. 
There's more than a &bade of rac:ia\ 
and nafionalistic prejudice bebiDdim-

CRITICISM OF IRIPS WAS 
NOT~EDFoRPuBUC 

Editor: 
It has come to my attention that in 

your March 10 issue, ooeof your staff 
writers quoted a private letter which I 
addressed to Professor Chalmers 
Johnson . This writer, Candice 
McFarland, got my university posi-
tion wrQIlg and misspelled my name. 

I am quoted as criticizing the 
School of Jnternational Relations and 
Pacific Studies (IRIPS) for having no 
one arouDdwho knows anything about 
East Asia. The first thing to say is that 
it is none of my business what goes on 
at IRIPS. Second, my private letters 
are nobody's business but my own 
and the person to whom they are ad-
dressed. Professor Johnson told me 
that he showed my letter to another 
faculty member at IRIPS, who chose 
to circulate it without asking me. 

Henry Stimson once said that 
gentlemen should not read other 
people's mail. Perhaps this was be-
cause all of us speak differently in 
private than we do for public con-
sumption. But since you have now so 
wrongly put me on the record con-
cerning IRIPS, let me say this: the 
dean of IRIPS, Peter Gourevitch, is 
one of the finest people I know. I 
believe that from the beginning he 
wanted a balance between scholars 
who know the countrfes they study 
deeply, like John Dower, Peter Evans 
and Chalmers Johnson 00 the one 
hand; and excellent Pacific Rim gen-

and Johnson and some others like 
them chose to leave lR/PS. 

When I received a letter from Pr0-
fessor Johnson announcing his depar-
ture and his replacement by a person 
of the "rational choice" persuasion, I 
wrote him back to say how much this 
distressed me, since for some years 
we liave bad a national pattern in 
which "rational choice" formalists 
have shown hostility to scholars with 
long training in the history, culture 

Andrea Dworkin. Pornography is not 
only inherently sexist, but it causes 
men to abuse and violate women. It 
promotes hate and violence. 

But these assertions are far from 
self~vident. It's not easy to "tell the 
difference" between what is exploit-
ative and what is simply erotica. It's 
subjective. Ten different people will 
offer 10 diffe~nt interpretations. And 
these are libly to diverge from the 
MacKinnon-Dworkin vanguard. (in-
deed, MacKinnon is fond of calling 
feminists who use porn or oppose its 
censorship, "pimps. ") Even if it were 
easy to tell the difference, such "pr0-
gressive" aUempts to cleanse popular 

and lquage of partiaalar countries, 
thus placing under threat (and some-
times virtually eliminating) \be sub-
field of comparative politics in vari-
ous political science departments. 

Recently, departments have also 
sought to fill positions in comparative 
politicsand international relations with 
Mformal modelers, " which is usually a 
euphemism for people with an ab-
stract logic that they think applies to 
any and all peoples of the world -
and therefore, believing it unneces-
sary to know any country deeply. This 
is an inteUectual disaster for a country 
already characterized by woefuUy in-
adequate knowledge and understand-
ing of the rest of the world. 

I know nothing about the candi-
dale chosen to replace Chalmers 
Johnson, but Professor Johnson has 
put his finger on a national trend, and 
in my (private) letter I expressed my 
suppon for his position. l don', mind 
doing that publicly now, but I do mind 
journalists who rifle through my mail 
and publish whatever they find in it 
lhat seems useful to them.

dangerous net. Censorship is a blunt 
instrument. 

But we don't have to imagine the 
resultsofsuchefforts. The MacKinnon 
model of pornography was recently 
applied in Canada. Among the "por-
nographic" contraband caught al the

supress the adjacent."

students, particularly those in 
nearby schools. Just down the free-
way, San Diego State University 
is only a few miles away, but a 
world apart in terms of recruiting 
underrepresented students. 

Though facing many of the 
same budget cutbacks as UCSD, 
SDSU still attracts a greater num-
ber of students of color. 

Why the difference? Certainly, 
a wide variety of factors contrib-
ute to the discrepancy. The two 
universities have varying academic 
standards, different approaches to 
curricula and contrasting campus 
atmospheres. But the difference 
between UCSD and SDSU in mi-
nority enrollment may boil down 
to SDSU's more aggressive ap-
proach to recruitment. 
A , ... of Two ...... 11. 

At UCSD, the main force be-
hind the recruitment of 
underrepresented students is the 
Student Outreach and Recruitment 
(SOAR) program. According to 
Timothy Johnston, associate di-
rector of Student Outreach, the 
program operates under a set of 
priorities established by the office 
of the UC President as well as the 
UCSD campus. 

SOAR recruits undem:presented 
students through various methods 
sudt as individual outreach programs 
in high schools, mailings and etImic 
cooferenccs. The program often 
works in conjunction with certain

on~pus ethnic student organi-
zations in order to coordinate ac-
tivities aimed at attracting pro-
spective minority students. 

SOAR also brings underrep-
resented high school students on 
campus to encourage application 
toUCSD. 

There are several programs that 
minority students can get involved 
in or that have a focus on 
underrepresented students, such as 
Advancement Via Individual De-
termination (AVID), the Minority 
Science Program, or the Take 
UCSD Home program. 

SDSU, which also has an ac-
tive recruitment program for 
underrepresented students, em-
ploys many of the same methods. 

H<5wever, SDSU also works with 
on-campus ethnic student organi-
zations in coordinating certain ac-
tivities, The univeraity actively 
encourages high school students 
to apply through programs like the 
Gompers School Program, in 
which 60 11th graders take three 
classes over a four-week period at 
SDSU. 

Like UCSD, SDSU has devel-
oped a number of programs for 
students of colpr, such as AVID 
and the Minority Science Program.

far more diverse. SDSU has a 
greater percentage of white stu-
dents than UCSD, but it also has a 
higher percentage of students in 
several ethnic groups. 

Chicanos make up 11.98 per-
cent of the population at SDSU, 
compared to 8.S percent at UCSD. 
SDSU also has a greater percent-
age of Mrican-American students 
(5.37 percent to UCSD's 2.S per-
cent) and Filipinos (S.66 percent 
to UCSD's 4.3 percent). Among 
other Asian groups, UCSD has a 
higher concentration, 21.1 percent 
to 7.79 percent. 

Johnston emphasized that the 
underrepresented student recruit-
ment effort is successful in achiev-
ing its established goals at UCSD. 
"It's successful in the sense that it 
encourages students to apply and it 
advertises the university," he said. 

Johnston blames UCSD's 
smaller percentages 10 different 
admissions requirements, adding 
that UCSD has a different appeal 
for applicants. "We've got more 
programs, more staff, we do more," 
said Johnston. 

The numbers seem to speak for 
themselves. Johnston, who previ-
ously worked for SDSU, stressed 
the fact that both campuses have 
different approaches in achieving 
their goals of more ethnically di-
verse campuses. Because each of-
fers a variety of programs and has 
a different environment, it is diffi-
cult to accurately compare their 
approaches. . 

"There is so much difference 
between the environments at 
SDSU and UCSD. Students are 
making a choice. It's more of a 
matter of higher education getting 
a message out to underrepresented 
students. They need to feel they 
are wanted and that there are op-
portunities on both campuses," 
Johnston said, 

Hutchinson agreed that the two 
universities have a different ap-
peal for potential students. "I 
couldn't rate them across the board 
because there is a difference in 

terms of ltudent market, " he said. 
Hutchinson added that he be-

lieves the focus of SDSU's re-
cruitment efforts are more broad-
based while UCSD h. stricter eli-
gibility requirements. 

Although SDSU's academic re-
quirements may not be as strin-
gent as UCSD's,this does not com-
pletely explain the difference in 
enrollment. UC Berkeley and 
UCLA have the same requirements 
as UCSD, yet the enrollment of 
certain underrepresented students 

. at those schools is much higher. 
Berkeley's and UCLA's Mrican-
American enrollment, for ex-
ample, is three times thatofUCSD. 
DoH ..... It....t P., om 

Muir College freshman Sharon 
Apple said she had a very positive 
experience with the UCSD out-
reach program. She attended 
Claremont High School and was 
contacted at an early date by the 
outreach program. "Ever since 
ninth grade, I have been in contact 
with people fro'in UCSD. One of 
the reasons I came to UCSD was 
because I felt like they wanted 
me," Apple said. 

Najda Robinson, a freshman at 
Fifth College, said she chose 
UCSD because of the quality of 
education and the environment, 
not because she felt an overwhelm-
ing support for her ethnicity. 

"I felt like I was more wanted at 
UC Santa Cruz because I began 
getting a lot of detailed propa-
ganda from Santa Cruz concern-
ing underrepresented minorities," 
Robinson said. 

Medea Armstrong, a Muir Col-
lege freshman, agreed that the re-
cruitment program hadn't really 
influenced her decision to come to 
UCSD, but she praised the post-
admittance programs like Sum-
mer Bridge, a summer program 
for underrepresented students. 

Many students agree that part of 
the recruitment problem stems from 
UCSD'satmosphere. According to 
Marshall College junior Everette 
Williams, UCSD's environment 
does not appeal to underrepresented 
students. 

"UCSD is limited in atmo-
sphere. There's not much to offer 
socially. It's not user-friendly ... 
you have to make an effort," Wil-

The UCSD G_rdiaa 

Iiams said. 
UCSD junior Anyoto Fabrough 

said that the surrounding commu-
nity also can play a part in the 
recruitment of underrepresented 
students. According to Fabrough, 
universities like UC Berkeley and 
UCLA reflect the diversity of the 
cities in which they are located. 
"They have more of an urban set-
ting. There are black people there 
to begin with," Fabrough said. 
"San Diego doesn't have that ur-
ban feel." 
PUturePl .. 

While both UCSD and SDSU 
must contend with San Diego's 
perceived atmosphere, a final fac· 
tor also contributes to the differ-
ences in enrollment - SDSU's 
agressive approach 10 recruiting. 

Hutchinson said that minority 
recruitment had inlensified over 
the last five years at SDSU as a 
result of SDSU President Thomas 
Day's belief tha.t a campus should 
represent the composition of the 
surrounding community. 

According to Johnston, there 
are really no plans to change 
underrepresented student recruit-
ment and outreach program at 
UCSD. 

Two post-acceptance programs 
for underrepresented students, a 
peer counseling program and stu-
dent support services, have re-
cently been added through the 
Office of Academic Support and 
Information Services (OASIS). 

But any major changes in the 
pre-acceptance recruitment pro-
cess will not be· so drastic, ac-
cording to Johnston. "We've been 
doing this for quite a few years. 
But it's a continuous effort," he 
said. 

Even if the SOAR does not 
plan for any long-term changes in 
its pre-acceptance recruitment pro-
gram, there is a growing realiza-
tion that more effort is still required 
in order to attract qualified 
underrepresented students. 

"Relatively, we're successful. 
The percentages are small and in 
no way accurately reflect the ac-
tual population percentages. 
We've got a lot of work to do," 
Johnston said.

No Wrist for the Tritons 
RECUPERATION: UCSD embraces break after wins over the South and Claremont 
By IkIan K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's tennis team 
enjoyed its 16-day break from match 
competition after its back·to-back 
victories over University of the 
South (TN) and Claremont College 
on March 11 and 12. For Liz 
LaPlante's walking wounded, the 
breaks haven't always been so kind. 

It seems the Triton women have 
discovered that breaking wrists can 
be as contagious as contracting the 
measles. With Kimberly Takemoto 
nursing a broken wrist suffered ear-

, lier in the season, fellow sophomore 
Anne Hoecker perfected a double 
take of the same feat, falling on her 
left wrist in a battle of sixth·seeds 
against the South. 

Though Hoecker was trouncing 
her foe (6-1, 3-1), she was forced to 
forfeit the match. X-rays showed 
that her left wrist was fractured. Michele Mllephanaakul backhanded Claremont', Ria (lost, &0, &3. 

"Takemoto fractured her wrist 
the same way," LaPlante said. "I 
don't know what's going on. Maybe 
it's contagious. Hopefully we'll get 
[Hoecker] back sometime in April." 

Fortunately, UCSD was able to 
overcome the visitors from Tennes-
see, 5-4, despite the forfeit. 

At number-one singles, Diane 
Chandler survived a scare from 
Kristin Ialac:ci, winning in three sets, 
6-7, 6-3, 6-0. Number three Hilary 
Somers ousted Helen Boehm (6-1, 
6-0), number four Heather Williams 
tore open Elizabeth Lumir (6-2, 6-
3), and fifth-seed Miki Kurokawa 
bandied lee Williams (6-4, 6-0). 

Michele Malepbansakul teamed 
up with Somers at number-two 
doubles to defeat Boehm-Barbour 

SYR.Kl;SE C~IVERSITY 

tandem, 7-5, 6-1 to assure the win. 
The contest witb Claremont 

wasn ' t close by any means, with 
UCSD walking allover the Athenas 
and winning by a final tally of 7-2. 

In the singles battering, onl y top-
seed Cbandlerended up on the wrong 
side of the win-loss column. 

After surviving a marathon match 
tbe day before, Olandler came up 
short against aaremont's top-gun 
Erick Anhood, 6-3, 7-6, in a gruel-
ing three-bour, two-set contest. 

"It was a bad loss for [Chan-
dler]," laPlante said. "She has 
beaten this girl before but it was 
obvious she was tired." 

Number two Malepbansakul, 
who lost a three-set decision to the 
South's Linnie Wheeless, exacted

Somers hammered Vicki Coles 

(6-1,6-0), WilTiams topped Tonya 
Buchanan (6-1, 4-6,6-2), Kurokawa 
outlasted Jodi Ostrow (6-4,3-6,.6-
3) and Michelle Wilbur mopped up 
Stella Ho (6-0, 6-0). 

The number-one doubles duo of 
Kurokawa-Williams turned in their 
best match of the year, unseating 
Anhood-Gost, 6-3, 6-0. 

Takemoto filled in oicely for the 
fatigued Chandler at number-three 
doubles, teaming up with Wilbur to 
demolisb Arocha-Ho, 6-1, 6-1. 

"The girls are playing very well 
right now and we have a lot of team 
deptb. I hope we can put this string 
of broken wrists behind us witb the 
long rest," laPlante said.

Tritons Extend Unbeaten Streak to Seven 
UNBEATABLE: UCSD demolishes University of the South, Williams College 7-2; bagels Southern California College, 9-0, over the break 
By MUNI Moorthy 
Steff Writer 

After beating University of the 
South (TN), 7-2, before finals week, 
the UCSD men's tennis team had a 

comfortable 
four-match 
win streak. 

W hi I e 
spring break 
is a respite for 
most stu-
dents, the Tri-
tons had 
barely enough 
time to set 
down their 
books before 
it was back to 

the courts for a trio of home matches. 
By the end of the break, the win 

streak was up to a record-breaking 
seven, and the team's overall record 
was a healthy 7-2. 

On Monday, the Tritons hosted 
ColoradoCollege in a hastily sched· 
uled match that was added to reo 
place an earlier rainout against 
Emory University. 

to-head match up, number·three 
player Roy Gessford came close with 
a 6-0, 6-1 shellacking. Rob Ho was 
also close, coming .way with a 6-3, 
6-Owin at the numher-fourposition. 

Jeff Young, playing in the num-
ber·fivespot, wuin coDtrol in his 6-
1, 6-1 domination of John Bacon, 
and up-and-comingsopbomore Eric 
Steidlmayer won easily, 6-2,6-1 in 
the sixth spot. 

The three doubles teams were 
near perfect, yielding only 11 games 
in their conquest of all three matches. 

The TritonS could not expect to 
be as fortunate against Williams 
College the following day. The visi-
tors frOm MUsachusetts were ranked 
second in the east region and 13th in 
the nation. 

Coacb Tim Ditzler's worst fears 
appeare~ to be coming true early on 
as Dan Brounstein and Young (num-
bers five and six singles, respec-
tively) lost their first sets while CrOSs 
and Yarnell struggled at the top. 

"We're getting a little lackadai· 
sical," said Ditzler, referring to the 
team's relaxed attitude during the 
win streak. "We're not putting out 
the focused effort that got us to 
where we are." 

Williams two, 
The team finished off the week 

with another sbutout, drubbing 
Southern California College, 9-0. 

In the top two spots, Cross 
struggled but beat sec's Ross Andel 
6-4,7-5, and Yarnell won 6-2, 6-2. 

Gessford and Ho picked up 
singles victories to up their personal 
win streaks to seven, while 
Brounstein dominated in a 6-1, 6-2 
victory in the number·five spot. 

Young bounced back from 
Tuesday 's poor play with a 6-0, 6-3 
victory, as the singles players once 
again were piclure perfect, reliev· 
ing the doubles teams of any undue 
pressure. 

Strong singles play has been a 
key in the win streak, but it has made 
it difficult for Coach Ditzlertoevalu· 
ate his team's doubles play. 

"The press ure isn' t there," 
Ditzler admits. "We haven' t had to 
utilize them 10 their full potential." 

The team 's upcoming road trip 
to Phoenix, AZ, April 1-3 should 
put that worry 10 resl. 

The team did not display any of 
the expected post·finals rustiness, 
crushing the clearly overmatched 
Tigers, 9-0. Although Young eventually fell , 

CrOSS'and Yarnell kept up their end 
of the bargain, triumphing in two 
sets, while Brounstein came from 
behind in a marathon match to win, 
5-7, 6-3, 6-3. 

Senior Roy Genion! remain. unbeaten In his ... t sev.n nultches. 

The Tritons will be facing three 
top·ranked teams, including the 
nation 's top·seed, UC Santa Cruz, 
in a weekend which Ditzler has 
termed a "mini·nationals." 

John Cross jumped all over the 
Tigers' Matt Perdue in his 6-2, 6-1 
victory in the number-one spot. Se· 
nior Vern Yarnell was just as tough, 
dumping his number-two, 6-1 , 6-3.

vaunted "double bagel" in the head·

ber-two doubles tandem ofGessford 
and Ho were also easy winners. 

Brounstein and youngster Anand 
Shah, playing in the number· three 
doubles spot, came oul on the losing 
end of a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 resull to round 
oul the final score - UCSD seven, 

An experienced Yarnell agreed. 
"[The upcoming opponents] are go· 
ing to be a lot belter," said the se· 
nior, contrast ing the upcoming 
matches wilh those during the win 
streak. "It ' ll be a good tune-up for

Triton Duffers 
Win Torrey 
Pines Tourney 
IHGOnNG ACES: 
Hartford rips up Torrey 
Pines, paces UCSD to 
tournament victory 
By Tedd LIdd 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team seems to be 
full of surprises these days. Some 
Ire more welcome than others. Take, 

for example, 
number-two 
golfer Brock 
Shafer's broken 
leg. Mishaps 
like that can re-
sult in devasta-
tion for In 
NCAA defend-
ing National 
Champion. 

Yet other 
surprises, such 
as the emer-

gence of freshman Mike Hartford, 
whose fust-place finisb at. the 44th 
Annual Southern California inter-
collegiate Golf Championships held 
March 11-12,quicklybringsasmile 
to Head Coach Mike Wydra's face. 

Riding Hartford's 77-73, two-
day performance, the Triton golfers 
aced a first-place overall outing in 
the College Division of the champi-
onships, hosted by UCSD at the 
Torrey Pines South Golf Course. 

"[Hartford) is a real level-headed 
player," Wydra said. "He's a fresh-
man phenom." 

The Triton "A" team members 
took advantage early with a solid 
ll-stroke lead (315) after the first 
round. 

UCSD continued to stretch their 
advantage, finishing with a 310 to 
catapult the team total to 625 for the 
toumament. The Triton golfers tow-
ered over sucb opponents as UC 
Riverside, Oaremont College and 
Pomona-Pitzer. 

"A" team members Tom Brown 
(78-79), Dale Abraham (79-79), 
Hunt Cairns (85-79) and Brian 
Walter (81-85) chalked up excep-
tional efforts for the Triton squad. . 

"We're nearing the end of the 
Dale Abraham era," said Wydra. 
"He's a self-made player who has 
worked very hard over his five-year 
career." 

Abraham, a consistently brilliant 
performer for UCSD, is the num-
ber-two ranked golfer in the nation 
for Division III and bas an excellent 
shot at winning an individual na-
tional championship, regardless of 
the team's performance. 

With UCSD able to field two six-
man teams, the Triton "B" squad 
captured third-place overall with a 
score of 656. 

Surprisingly strong perfor-
mances were turned in by "B" team 
golfers Alex Behrend and Arnie 
Campbell, who shot 76-81 and 82-
77, respectively . 

Othersc:oren for the UCSD golf-
ers included Steve Lynn (87-88), 
Rob Brannen (83-88), Peter Alsop 
(85-84), and Matt Nisonger(90-88). 

"We're I very versatile team," 
Wydra said. "But it's going to be 
awfully tougb to win it all this year." 

If Shafer returns u expected in 
six weeks and if Hartford continues 
to dominate his more experienc:cd 
competition, the UCSD golf team 
c:ouJd end up with with the beat 
surprise of them aU by wiODiIli its 
aeconcI-consec:udve national title.

Kenyon (6:51.04) all bit the toucb

(6:51 .10).

UCSD Scorches Spring Rebel Games 
BAmNG .100: Tritons battle to +4 mark at Florida's Invitational Tournament 
By M .... MoorthJ 
Staff Write, 

The 'UCSD women's softball 
team spent its extended spring break 
in balmy Orlando, FL finding itself 

at the Spring 
Rebel Games 
from Marcb 
19-26. 

W h i I e 
most of tbe 
high-powered 
East Coast 
programs 
were just 
bappy to be 
able to play 
outside on 
grass without 

the threat of winter snow. the week-
long toumament was a chance for 
the Tritons to see bow they com-
pared to the big guns of the nation's 
top schools. 

After a .500 showing in eight 
games, Triton Head Coach Patricia 
Gerckens could only be/pleased as 
berwomen upped theirscason record 
to 5-11. 

The TritQns started the week in 
magnificent fashion with a 7-0 sbut-
out over Kalamazoo, MI. 

Shannon Mounger was the star 
of the day, pitcbingthe shutout while 
coming through at the plate with 
two RBI. With UCSD dominating 
play, a seven-run "mercy rule" ended 
the affair after six innings. 

The results were not as promis-
ing in the second game, when Al-
legheny College (PA) trounced the 
Tritona, 8-0. 

After only five innings, the mercy 

rule ended UCSD's upset bid of the 
top-10 ranked Alligators. 

In their contest against Calvin 
College (Ml), the Tritons pulled out 
a wild eltra-innings tbriller by a 
score of 12-11. 

When a time-limit rule ended 
regulation play after five innings, 
UCSD matched Calvin's offenaive 
spurts tit-for-tat through eight in-
nings. Finally, UCSD answered 
C!)vin's two runs in tbe bottom of 
l1fe nintb witb three of its own to 
record the win. 

Shortstop Kelli Connolly, 
Mounger and third baseman Katie 
Galvin each had two RBIs to fuel a 
high-powered offenaive sbow. 

In another close matcbup, UCSD 
was forced into the tiebreaker for-
mat once again agai~t North Adams 
(MA). UCSD wu aided by triples 
from Mounger and Connolly, but 
tbe Massachusetts team proved too 
mucb for the Tritons, who fell 3-2 
after eigbt innings . 

In wbat turned out to be its best 
game of the road trip, UCSD sur-
prised the Nortbeast Region's top-
seeded East Connecticut $quad, 3-2. 
East Connecticut was befuddled by 
Mounger botb on the mound and at 
tbe plate. 

Mounger singled to start the top 
of the eighth and was advanced to 
second on Michelle Courtright's 
sacrifice bunt. Kim Reynick's hard 
single to left center drove in 
Mounger for the game-winner. 

The Tritons had anotber top-10 
opponent, Mount aair (NJ), on the 
ropes early, but let the team slip 
away in the tiebreaker, losing 6-3. 

Junior Emily Rubin's sacrifice 
fly in the·bottom of the second scored 
Connolly and put UCSD on top, 3-
2, but Mount aair tied it in the 
fourth and won the game with three 
runa, including a solo homer, in the 
sixtb. 

"I was happy with the team's 
performance through the first five 
innings," Gerckens said. "But we 
gave [Mount aair) the game in the 
tiebreaker witb mental errors." 

Her team rebounded, bowever, 
in its seventh game of the break to 
pound Carroll CoUege (WI), 7-2. 
Kristin Sbueler led tbe offense, belt-
ing a two-run double in tbe tbird 
inning. 

Junior Lisa Gil kept Carroll 
guessing, mixing in a lethal change-
up and offspeed pitches to record 
her first win of the season. 

In their final game, fatigue played 
a major factor in Illinois Wesleyan '5 
5-1 drubbing of the Tritons. 

Rubin, who started at catcher 
through all eight games, provided 
the only offensive puncb for UCSD, 
going 2-3 with an RBI. 

"We sbouldn't have lost that 
game," Gercltens said. "Maybe we 
just ran out of gas." 

Gerckena was very pleased, how-
ever, with ber group's overall per-
formance. "Courtright and Connolly 
have definitely done a great job for 
us, and Reynick's hitting is coming 
around," she said. 

"The season has changed. We're 
hoping to get back to .500, and the 
team knows that we can win."

Tritons 
Tear Up 
Track Over 
Break 
ON THEIR WAY: Buehler 
and Sleenhof qualify for 
NCMs in field events 
By TecIcI UdcI 
Staff Writer 

Not everybody rests during 
spring break. While some students 
sipped in exotic locales 

or slept in until 
noon, the 
UCSD track 
and field team 
was busy win-
ning meets. 

The Triton 
tracksters be-
gan their break 
by pummeling 
UC Riverside 
and Cal Poly 
Pomona at a 

UCSn-hosted tri-meet on March 12. 
Both the men and women's squads 
clobbered their nearest opponents 
by an average of 21 points. 

"We're still developing as a 
team," Head Coach Tony Salerno 
said. MBut we do havea lotof depth." 

Randy Buehler captured first 
place in both the liammer throw 
(171'7")andthe shot put (39'5.75j. 
He also threw serond-place honors 
in the discus (123'6" behind team-

All-Anlerican: UCSD's Gabe Lawson grabs ninth-
place, All-American honorable mention at NCAAs 

Associate Sports Editor 
UCSD sophomore Gabe Lawson 

went up against the very best in the

During the final round, Lawson 
gained the respect of everyone in 
attendance, competing very well 
against the eventual national run-

mate Marc Sleenhofs 145'1". 
For his efforts, Buehler not only 

qualified for the NCAA Champion-
shi~ but was also named Athlete 
of tli~ Week by the CalifornialNe-
vada Track and Field Association. 

Sleenbof stole first in the javelin 
(157'7") and second in the shot put 
(38'10.25"). 

On the track, JJ. Castner again 
proved unbeatable, speeding to a 
fust-place time of 15:18.02 in the 
5,000 meters. 

. But it wu Michele Domico who 
turned in the most complete perfor-
mance for the Tritons. Competing 
in seven different events, she ac-
counted for over one-third of 
UCSD's point total on the women's 
side. 

Domico jumped to a first place in 
the long jump (16'3") and triple 
jump (34'7.75"), while also helping 
UCSD win the 4x400 relay. 

Other first-place winners for the 
Tritons included Lisa Shepard 

(15.~9 in 100-hurdles), Terri 
Paulauskas (13.23 in lOO-meters), 
Suzie Schmidt (1:12.3 in 400 
hurdles), Tara Monaghan (136'3" 
in hammer) and Krista Poehler (5 '0" 
in high jump). 

Last weekend's1994 UCSD 
Spring Break Open brought in over 
1,500 competitors from such coun-
tries as Canada and Brazil. 

Sleenbofbuded an NCAA quali-
fying mark of 161'6" in the javelin, 
placing him tbirdoveraJI in the meet. 

Notable performances for UCSD 
also included Monapan (third in 
hammer), Creed Stary (fourth in the 
pole vault), Ian Cooke (second in 
the bi&b jump), Damian Coleman 
(fourth in the long jump), Doug 
Olander (fourth in the triple jump), 
and Alan Grant (seoond in the 800 
meters). 

"[Lawson] 
is the ideal athlete," UCSD Head 
Coach Lisa Posthumus said. "He 
displays tremendous sportsmanship, 
he's an outstanding athlete and he' s 
great to coach. " 

Lawson, perhaps in nervous an-
ticipation of the intense competi-
tion he was up against, had a rocky 
start when he just barely qualified to 
advance to the second round by grab-
bing the 24th and final spot. 

"[Lawson] was fencing ner-
vously in round one," Posthumus 
said. "He didn't fence his game." 

Round two was an entirely dif-
ferentstory, though, with Lawson's 
true colors shining through. 

Lawson battled his way to a sec-
ond-place finish in his pool of six to 
advance to the third round with an 
eightb-place seed. 

Sophomore G .... I..8wson placed 
ninth lit NCAA" In Bolton. 
ner-up and taking home ninth. 

The accomplishment is incred-
ible,especiaUy coming from a Divi-
sion III school on the west coast in 
what is considered to be an east 
coast-dominated sport. 

"[Lawson] has got a great future 
ahead of him," Posthumus said. "If 
he trains hard, he could be a con-
tender for the Olympics in 2000." 

First-year coach Posthumus was 
clearly excited by ber star's perfor-
mance. "Our goal was just to reach 
the NCAAs. To have an Ali-Ameri-
can is incredible."

22 SPORTS The UCSD GuardiaD MODoy, March 28,1994 

Story by Brian K. Hutto, Spo rt s Ed t or 

Senior Travis Miller has hac! a star-studded career as a Triton, recording nine national tides 

fier nine Division III indi-
vidual swimming National 
titles, two national records 
and three Triton school 
records, senior Travis 
Miller has finally found a 
home at UCSD. It hasn't 

always been that way. 
"I've changed a lot throughout my four 

years," Miller says. "There was a time when 
the only thing I could think about was quitting 
the team and transferring out of here." 

Fortunately for the Tritons, Miller didn't. 
For Travis MiII~r, Division III swimming 

was supposed to fun . Sure, the Pasadena, CA 
resident received deep-pocketed scholarship 
offers from perennial Division I swimming 
powerhouses USC and UCLA, but "Division 
III offered a lot more enjoyment. 

"I thought that if! went Division I alII would 
do would be to go to classes and swim. It would 
be a job, not college," Miller recalled. 

So Miller beaded soutb to La Jolla. Little 
did he know what he was getting into. 

"I have always taken swimmingseriously," 
Miller said. "I went to a school with a pretty 
good swimming program, so I knew that I was 
going to work hard wherever I went." 

But Miller's carefully laid-out plans didn't 
include one thing-Head Coacb Doug Boyd. 
Just as Miller signeeJ bis national letter of 
intent, Boyd, a former assistant at Indiana 
University, was setting up shop as UCSD's 
new men's and women's swimming coach. 

"Things were very different when I got 
here. I was following what the older guys had 
told me about tbe coach [Bill Morgan] and tbe 
system," Miller said. "But [with Boyd] it was 
a different coach and adifferentsystem. Some 
people bought into his system right away, I 
didn't. We sort of butted heads for a while." 

Miller's high school coach, Burt CaMer, 
had embraced an old-lCbool philosophy of 
swimmina 14-15,000 yards a day with little 
empbaaia 00 weigbt training. 

"(Canner's) proaram really worbd. He bas 
beeD IIOUDd for 25 yean ad his IepUtIIioo 
preceded him. Doua WIa lib dill, .. Miller said. 

Boyd'. wortouta involved abort, speed-

intensive stroke work, with a heavy emphasis 
on weights. Miller had his doubts and dis-
cussed them openly with Boyd. 

"Every time I questioned him, he kicked 
me out of praclice," Miller said. "I was kicked 
out of a lot of workouts my freshman year." 

Despite all the time out of the pool, Miller 
still made the NCAA qualifying mark at the first 
meet of the year and wenl on to win both the 100-
and 200-yard backstrokes at Nationals. 

Miller'. Title. 
After four years swimming for UCSD, 
Travis Miller has finished his career with 
a total of nine national titles and three 
national records. 
(*NatJonal Record) 

"That was the worst thing that could have 
happened to him," Boyd recalled. "He got the 
attitude that he oouId jlllt show up to ~ 
when he wanted to and half ... his training 
because he was a National Champion. He had a 
tenibleattitude towardswimmingand thetelm." 

'" was I Punk," Miller agrees. 
Miller spent tbe summer of his freshman 

year lifeguardina. partyilll and doina every-
tbilll but keeping bimself in sbape. 

-I queationed whether I would evea ao 
back," he said. -I decided to stick it out IIICI 
wait until my junior year to IrIDIfer to UCLA. .. 

Miller retwned to Boyd'. trainin, camp 
out of shape and with an attihMIe to match. 

"I fell I could still swim fast although the 
program didn't work," Miller said. "I was a 
National Cbampion in spite of [Boyd]." 

But Boyd wouldn't tolerate Miller's atti-
tude and kicked him off the squad al Ihe 
beginning of his sophomore year. 

"I told him I didn't want him around. He 
was bad for the team. It was my way or the 
highway," Boyd said. 

"I was naive enough to choose the high-

wly .• thought a lot about what. wanted after 
be booted me," Miller said. "Him ticking me 
off the team made me a betlcr swimmer." 

Miller returned a few weeki later and be-
gan preparing for National .. Hampered by I 
slow start and an injured ankle (inflicted in a 
pickup basketball game). Miller still captured 
the 200 t.ck title in near-rec:ord time. 

"That'. not what I remember," MUler said. 
"I remember pttilll wbooped in the 100 back 
(he finilbed third] and I bew that it was my 
fault. I was extremely motivated after that." 

IDCIeed, Miller was voted team captain 
before bis jllllior year and let an ideal example 
for bis INmmatel in the pool and out. 

"[Miller] had a very different attitude his 
junior year," Boyd said. "He was an excellent 
leader with a focused attitude." . 

Miller's rebirth was rewarded early in the 
swim season when he broke the National 
record in December at the Speedo Cup in the 
200 back (1 :49.4). 

"That helped a lot," Miller recalled. ". 
knew I was ready. " 

Heading into the Nltional meet, 'ready' 
was an understatement. Miller scorched the 
field in the 200 1M, brealring the national 
record (1 :50.1). He continued his torrid pace 
by lowering his own 200 back record (1:48.48) 
and stealing the 100 fly on his way to receiv-
ing Swimmer of the 'tear honors. 

"I felt I deserved it," Miller said. "I worked 
hard and stayed focused all year. (Boyd] knew 
, had it in me, and I guess I finally bought into 
his system of thinking. " 

Miller's senior year was equally success-
ful. He once again dominated the meet, win-
ning his fourtb straight 200 bacIc title in record 
time (1:48.13), and capturing the 200 1M and 
100 back titles for his second consecutive 
Swimmer of the Year accolade . 

But Miller's attitude toward the team buly 
demonstratel how far be baa come since his 
freshman year. Instead of CODCCDtrating on 
his individual maro, Miller decided insteld 
to focus on the team-orieoted relays in an 
attempt to knock defendi. champ Kenyon 
off its championship podeItaI. 

"He made individual aaaificea for tile team

kicking him off the team WII the amarteat thing 
I could ever do. He developod iDeo III exceUent

With his swim career bebiad him. Miller is 
now focuIed on mating it iDeo medical school.
