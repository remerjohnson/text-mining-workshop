UCSD researchers have 
developed a cell-phone applica-
tion to help illegal immigrants 
cross the U.S.-Mexico border 
more safely. The application 
— the Transborder Immigrant 
Tool — is a controversial device 
that some consider a humani-
tarian project and others an ille-
gal aid to smugglers.

The project to create the 
application, led by assistant 
visual-arts professor Ricardo 
Dominguez and coded 
by research theorist Brett 
Stalbaum, is aimed at reducing 
death rates among migrants 
crossing from Mexico into the 
U.S. by directing users to water 
caches and safety beacons via 
inexpensive cell phones. 

“What we’re studying is 
whether very inexpensive 
mobile phones with GPS 
devices can be repurposed as 
an emergency life-saving tool,” 
Stalbaum said. 

The development of the 
application has spanned more 
than a year. The researchers 
described their methods as 
a five-step process: mapping 
out the land surrounding the 
U.S.-Mexico border, research-
ing both dangerous and safe 
communities in the area, test-
ing GPS coordinates and vocal 
instructions, testing the appli-
cation by walking between 
Mexico and the U.S. and let-
ting immigrants in both coun-
tries test the tool for further 
feedback and development.

Director of the California 
Immigration Policy Center 
Reshma Shamasunder said she 
commends the collective effort 
of UCSD researchers.

“There is a human trag-
edy occurring along the 
U.S.-Mexico border, as 
people attempt to cross and 
find themselves lost or aban-
doned by smugglers who care 
little or nothing about them,” 
Shamasunder said. “Efforts 
to provide emergency infor-
mation or assistance that can 
save lives are a compassionate 
response to this situation.”

STUDENTS DEMAND REFUND FOR EXTENSION PROGRAM
By Tanja Fijalkowski
Contributing Writer

A number of UCSD Extension stu-
dents have filed formal grievances against 
the administration, claiming that the 2008 
Digital Arts Center (DAC) program did 
not adequately prepare them for a career 
in Web design, as had been promised.

Students in the year-long program 
released a statement to administrators 
expressing dissatisfaction with the man-

agement of the program and demanding 
monetary compensation in the form of 
half their tuition — or $6,750 per student. 
Twelve of the 19 students enrolled in 
the DAC program signed a statement of 
complaint addressed to the university, and 
seven filed formal grievances.

According to the statement, the 
majority of student complaints revolved 
around the teaching methods of instruc-
tors Harrison Watts and John Lane. The 
students claim that Watts used unclear, 

inadequate modes of teaching and that 
Lane, a lead instructor and DAC faculty 
advisor, left town for 20 days during the 
quarter and sent e-mails that stated the 
class would review old material during 
this time. However, DAC student Kevin 
Root claimed the material was new and 
unfamiliar. 

“The e-mails are not only insulting 
to our intellectual abilities, but untrue,”

Dec. 25 — It’s a bit asinine, even 
obscene, how preoccupied Hollywood 
has been with the number nine this 
year. Off the heels of “9,” “District 9” 
and (triple whammy) “$9.99,” Rob 
Marshall’s latest, “Nine,” loses itself in 
the fray. To be fair, though, it’s better 
than that: This grand girl party is a 
spin-off of a Tony Award-winning 
Broadway musical first produced in 
1982, and the last screenplay of late 
legend Anthony Minghella.

UCSD Reaches ‘Historic Labor Rights Breakthrough’

By Regina Ip
contributing Writer

The Workers Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights organization, 
recognized UCSD on Nov. 18 for its 

efforts in reaching a “historic labor 
rights breakthrough” with the appar-
el manufacturer Russell Athletics, a 
subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom.

Along with nearly 100 universities 
across the nation — including Duke, 
Columbia and Harvard — UCSD 
boycotted Russell Athletics, the larg-
est licensee of retail sales at UCSD, for 
labor rights violations at its factories 
in Honduras, where it serves as the 
largest private-sector company. 

In June, UCSD terminated the 
trademark-licensing contract with 

Russell that authorizes the company 
to use the university’s artwork, pre-
venting Russell from legally apply-
ing UCSD logos to garments. 

The long-time suppliers of 
UCSD logo apparel — including 
sweatshirts, T-shirts and sweatpants 
— agreed to provide workers in 
Honduras fair labor standards and 
working conditions on Nov. 14. 

“We think these are tremendous-
ly positive and indeed historic agree-
ments,” WRC executive director 
Scott Nova said. “We think Russell 

deserves credit for embracing this 
kind of sweeping change. We are 
very optimistic about the ability of 
the company and the union to work 
together to implement the accords.”

The company also agreed to 
open a new factory, rehire workers, 
provide them with economic assis-
tance and establish a joint union-
management training program. 

“The effect on students will be 
satisfaction that products carrying the

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie

TWO COKES SHORT By Sam Pelle

By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin
Associate News Editor

Thousands of panicking, last-
minute UC applicants received a 
nasty shock earlier this week when 
the UC of the President Web site 
experienced a “slowdown” that pre-
vented students from submitting 
their college applications.

“I wouldn’t categorize it as a fail-
ure — it wasn’t,” UCOP spokesman 
Ricardo Vasquez said. “It was a slow-
down — [it’s just] what happened.”

The problem began Sunday night, 
when an unknown computer mal-
function appeared less than a day 
before the Dec. 1 application dead-
line. 

“We haven’t found the source of 
the problem,” Vasquez said. “Each 
year, we do rigorous stress tests on 
the system prior to opening the 
application and filing period, and 
we have planned for a heavy load at 
the end of the filing period. But our 
preliminary analysis indicates that 
this is not a problem of capacity or 
volume.”

Because of the number of stu-
dents affected by the slowdown, 
UCOP Director of Undergraduate 
Admissions Susan Wilbur made the 
decision to extend the deadline by 
two days, to 11:59 p.m. on the night 
of Dec. 2.

The extension came as a relief to 
Miramonte High School senior and 
UC applicant Tucker Kahn, who 
said he tried to submit his applica-
tion on Monday night.

According to Kahn, the Web site 
stalled repeatedly at the eighth step 
of the application process, remain-
ing on the “loading” page for over 
an hour through multiple attempts 
to submit.

“I was pretty pissed off,” Kahn 
said. “I didn’t understand how a 
Web site like Facebook can oper-
ate with millions and millions of 
people, but people try to submit 
stuff to one Web site for one night 
and it crashes. I just don’t get how 
that works.”

Kahn, who was applying exclu-
sively to UC campuses, was finally 
able to submit his application at 2:30 

a.m. — two and a half hours after 
the official deadline. 

Kahn was not the only one to 
take advantage of the extension. 
According to Vasquez, approximate-
ly 2,900 applicants submitted their 
late applications over the course 
of an 11-hour period from 6 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. on Tuesday. These were 
in addition to the roughly 129,000 
students who had already turned in 
their applications before the Web 
site malfunction — and not count-
ing the thousands of students who 
continued to submit their applica-

tions until Wednesday night.
The UCOP took steps to get the 

word out about the extended dead-
line to worried students by posting 
information about the extension on 
its Web site and notifying high-
school counselors.

“This is a very stressful period 
for students — we wouldn’t want to 
do anything to add to that stress,” 
Vasquez said. “We will look into it 
and get to the bottom of it.”

Martin at hbiscegl@ucsd.edu.

The particulars of the language of a Winter Quarter 2010 student survey — as well 
as a prolonged debate over various 
allocations of funds — dominated 
the drawn-out final Fall Quarter A.S. 
council meeting last night. 

An especially lengthy presenta-
tion from Professor Ross Frank of 
the Ethnic Studies 
department 
encouraged the 
council to install 
an impartial direc-
tor within the 
A.S. Local Affairs 
office to review 
American-Indian representation.

Student Kayvan Ghaffari pre-
sented a resolution to make the graffiti 
stairs in Mandeville Hall a legal place 
for free expression. Ghaffari proposed 
Winter and Spring Quarters as a trial 
period for students to tag freely with-
out fear of being prosecuted by police.

President Utsav Gupta updated 
councilmembers on the Fall 2009 
happenings. Gupta successfully cre-
ated new positions within his office, 
obtained ‘B’ parking permits for sena-
tors and college chairs, expanded the 
UCSD football team support group 
on Facebook to 4,000 members and 
cinched lieutenant governor lead 
candidate Janice Hahn to speak on 
campus in March.

During the rest of his term, Gupta 
hopes to increase A.S. visibility efforts 
with weekly video podcasts, create bet-
ter public relations by holding more 
press conferences and town-hall meet-
ings and fight for priority enrollment 
for A.S. councilmembers in spring.

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senator 
Pauline Nuth said that ERC is cur-
rently seeking a new provost and 
looking to revamp the Making of the 
Modern World core program.

The most heated discussion of the 
night began with a debate over $2,160 
allocated to the Center for Student 
Involvement for the annual Martin 

Luther King, Jr. parade. In past years, 
A.S. only funded the parade $1,500. 
Councilmembers were split over the 
amount, but decided to allocate a nice 
median of $1,900 for the event.

AVP Academic Affairs Jordan 
Taylor and VP Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch got into a two-person 
debate over the Course and Professor 

Evaluation stu-
dent-survey funds. 
Benesch wanted 
to protect C.A.P.E. 
by providing 
a “‘necessary” 
Memorandum of 
Understanding 

for funding, but Taylor insisted that it 
would slow the process and hinder the 
program. An allocation of $10,000 was 
approved to move from C.A.P.E. to the 
U.S. grants line item.

As the night dragged on, a num-
ber of councilmembers left, and the 
fourth-floor forum was left with 17 
members — exactly quorum, or the 
minimum number of members need-
ed to be present for a valid vote.

Wording of the Winter Quarter 
student survey posed the biggest time-
hog of the night. Councilmembers 
debated for more than two hours over 
a 16-question survey. 

Vague word choices, such as 
“something other than the above,” 
drove councilmembers into the most 
intense debate of the night. They dis-
cussed wording and potential hidden 
messages behind questions about food 
ideas at the Grove Cafe, the proposed 
A.S. store merchandise and different 
types of Loft events. 

Freshman Senator Kevin Hoang 
accidentally referred to students as 
“children” when discussing whether or 
not students visit the Grove Cafe. 

By 1:15 a.m., councilmembers 
were still dissecting the survey ques-
tions, citing a motion to add questions 
about how much students are willing 
to spend to support a potential foot-
ball team, the Loft and transportation.

Russell label, maybe in the bookstore 
in the future, will be produced under 
much-improved labor conditions,” 
UCSD Bookstore director John Turk 
said. “Some students are acutely aware 
of that and care deeply … [They] will 
feel pretty good about this because their 
actions made a difference, not just on 
this campus but nationwide. There’s a 
lot of power in student activism.” 

Turk is also a member of the 
Committee for the UC Code of 
Conduct for Trademark Licensees, 
which advised the UC Office of the 
President to eliminate contracts with 
Russell Athletics. The committee stat-
ed that the company was not in com-
pliance with the code of conduct, and 
would not be able to retain its license 
until it met the required standards. 

The bookstore requires every one 
of its vendors to join the Fair Labor 
Association so it can be informed of 
any labor-condition violations. 

The bookstore replaced Russell 
with alternate company Wideworld, 
which manufactures spandex-based 
products in the United States.

Since January, Russell faced the 
largest collegiate boycott of an appar-
ell company ever recorded after the 
WRC investigated the closure of the 
factories (due to an attempt by work-
ers to unionize) last October. As more 
student activists and garment workers 
from the unions of the Confederación 
General del Trabajo and Sitrajerzeesh 
campaigned, several members of the 
UC Congress wrote to the Russell CEO. 
Shortly after the Fair Labor Association 
put the company on probation, Russell 
announced it would make concessions.

“They became much more respon-
sive because they were very concerned 
about the impact on these university 
relationships,” Nova said. “The kind 
of action that UCSD took put a huge 
amount of pressure on the company, 
and that made them more interested 
than they were initially in finding a 
resolution.”

The Student Workers Collective of 
UCSD petitioned Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and passed the Resolution for 
Sweatshop Workers’ Right to Associate

As the holidays approach, it’s hard not to worry how you’ll be able to afford everyone 
on your list. If you’re anything like 
How-to Guru, you’re also probably 
wondering how to pick up some stuff 
for yourself in the meantime.

Two words: thrift store.
Here’s how you’ll know you’ve 

found one. It must carry the faint 
smell of a flatulent grandma and con-
stantly play a CD full of ’80s power 
ballads on low volume. Thrift stores 
are full of ugly shit — dresses covered 
in mysterious stains, porcelain clown 
lamps and Bill Cosby sweaters. But 
every once in a while — when the 
stars align mid-Toni Braxton howl — 
you will stumble upon the most awe-
some $5 cocktail dress of all time.

Buffalo Exchange, on the other 
hand, is not a thrift store. It’s full of 
barely worn, mildly priced merchan-
dise. The difference between the two 
is a girl in trendy glasses who’s already 
picked out the hip stuff for you.

You must be hip girl — sort 
through the shit yourself. And doing 
so, young thriftshopper, requires strict 
adherence to the following rules.

Be patient. When you step into 
secondhand world, the rules of 
consumerism change. That sweater 
doesn’t come in a small, customer ser-
vice means a creepy grin from the guy 
at the register and all dressing-room 
surfaces are questionably sticky. If you 
want to find that vibrant sequined 
frock, you must flip through every 
piece of pukey clothing in the store. 
Don’t think of it as a chore — it’s an 
expedition into a world of society’s 
most deject objects.

Make quick judgements. If you 
think that windbreaker might have 
potential, it probably doesn’t. You 
don’t have time to meditate on it 
anyway — there are six more aisles of 
crap you still have to comb through 
before you find your glory item: the 
worn-in shirt with the nonsensical 
saying that you love at first glance. 

Beware of thrift eye (a less serious 
strain of Triton eye). When surround-
ed by mediocrity, your attractiveness 
standards plunge. But much unlike 
your drunken one-night stand with 
a crusty-faced slob, your decision to 
bring home that damp shoulder-pad-
ded blazer may have long-term effects.

Never buy purely out of nostalgia. 
If it reminds you of Grandma, it will 
make you look like Grandma. If it’s a 
pair of high-waisted jeans you’ve seen 
on Full House, slowly back away. If it’s 
something from a Richard Simmons 
work-out video, save it for Halloween.

Always do a stain inspection on 
potential purchases. You’d be sur-

Next quarter, your education is going to cost more. A lot more. A small group of important people in suits made that decision for you last month.
As expected, this made students angry. They protested. They cried. 

They made a lot of Facebook groups. As also expected, the increase 
passed anyway. 

It’s always frustrating to look back on these periods of tumult and real-
ize how futile our efforts sometimes are. No matter how outraged we get, 
how much of a ruckus we make or how often we walk out of class, rarely 
are we able to prevent the passage of major university policy. 

But there are some things we can influence a lot more readily. Starting 
in January, the A.S. Council — your elected student representatives — will 
be debating a series of student-fee referendums. Two of these are designed 
to bail out failing campus enterprises. The other is meant to bring you a 
football team. There might even be a few surprise proposals along the way 
— we’ll just have to wait and see.

The difference between this type of fee increase and the one dealt by 
the UC Board of Regents, however, is that referendums actually afford stu-
dents some say in the matter at hand. You get to vote. You get to decide. 

That doesn’t mean you should wait until Spring Quarter rolls around 
to have your voice heard, though. There’s a lot to be done in the mean-
time.

Most importantly, it will be crucial to ensure that the council comes 
up with referendum language that allows students new degrees of control 
over the operations they would be funding. This concern will be most 
apparent in the council’s discussion of the transportation and Loft refer-
endums — both of which could easily leave students monetarily shafted if 
certain necessary precautions are not taken. 

The Loft, in particular, merits a closer look. This is the second year in 
a row now that campus officials have tried to implement a student fee to 
fund the fledgling nightclub. And, for the second year in a row, many stu-
dents are rightfully skeptical about the proposal. The fact that the univer-
sity built a performance venue without the foresight to secure it a funding 
source should raise all kinds of questions. 

Many councilmembers, unfortunately, appear ready to throw together 
a hasty referendum that would ask students to pay for the Loft without 
gaining any significant degree of control over its operations. Fortunately, 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta has outlined an alternative proposal, one that 
gives students power over the venue’s annual budget and significant over-
sight into Loft spending. Here’s hoping the rest of the council catches on.

The transportation referendum will require the same sort of checks 
and balances — that is, if the council even agrees to sponsor it. Not much 
has been discussed so far, but the core issues remain the same: If we’re 
going to be paying for the campus shuttle service, we better make sure we 
have some say in how it runs. It’s all too easy to buy into the “If you don’t 
fund us, we’re going to cut service” mantra currently being espoused by 
transportation officials. Rather than let panic take hold, let’s make sure 
our councilmembers take a calm, collected approach to this issue while 
maintaining the goal of student empowerment. They need us. We have 
the upper hand.

In general, the university doesn’t like the idea of ceding control to 
students. Our campus officials will likely resist providing us with any real 
sort of governance. With that in mind, be wary of “governing boards” 
and “oversight committees.” These tend to be largely symbolic and almost 
entirely ineffective (see: Athletic, Recreation and Sports Advisory Board). 
The key is to establish a student majority on these boards. Which we now 
have the opportunity to do.

There’s certainly going to be a lot to talk about next quarter, and every 
student would be wise to take part in the discussion. This is your univer-
sity, after all. More importantly, it’s your money.

OPINION� THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Dear Editor,
The Nov. 23 article “Grass with 

No Roots” brought to light several 
issues with sustainability efforts 
on campus. The author’s apparent 
confusion concerning those efforts, 
however, highlights an even more 
pressing matter: the lack of commu-
nication and collaboration regarding 
sustainable endeavors.

When a reporter for the 
Guardian does not even have 
enough information to write an 
informed article about sustainabil-
ity on campus, the community of 
students, staff and faculty dedicated 
to a sustainable campus clearly 
need to outreach more effectively 
to the rest of the UCSD population. 
The Sustainability Resource Center 
(SRC) is that outreach.

The Sustainability Resource 
Center is not a “special interest 
club.” It is a resource center that 
is dedicated to environmental and 
social issues pertinent to the cam-
pus community. Just as the Cross-
Cultural Center, LGBT Resource 
Center and Women’s Center each 
inhabits its own physical space to 
maximize outreach and effective-
ness, so too does the SRC.

Moreover, none of the funding 
for the renovations of the physical 
space came from the $2.34 quar-
terly student fee passed in the last 
referendum. The quarterly fee sup-
ports sustainability programming, 
provides resources to students and 
sustainability-oriented campus 
organizations and provides inno-
vative student projects with grant 
money through the Green Initiative 
Fund.

We agree that UCSD’s shuttle 
system is a critical part of sustain-
ability. Transportation Services cur-

rently needs around $3 million to 
maintain current services. 

We regret that the SRC lacks 
the capacity to make a significant 
impact on this deficit financially, but 
we are working to advance alterna-
tive transportation in other ways.

 For example, the SRC supports 
Biofuels Action and Awareness 
Network, a student-led organiza-
tion that creates fuel from waste 
vegetable oil and researches efficacy 
of biofuels in campus shuttles. The 
SRC budget comes from students 
and goes directly back to the UCSD 
community through student-led 
sustainability efforts.

We also agree that because the 
UCSD undergraduate student body 
has voted to allot a significant 
budget to sustainability on cam-
pus, a permanent position in the 
A.S. Council needs to be created 
to represent the students’ call for a 
sustainable campus and to ensure 
that allocated funds are spent effec-
tively. We have been working with 
the A.S. Council to create an AVP of 
Sustainability that will help oversee 
these efforts.

As students working within 
UCSD’s sustainability community, 
it is often hard for us to step back 
and understand how the rest of 
the school perceives sustainability 
efforts on campus.  

Articles like this help us to re-
evaluate both the work we do and 
the way we relate to the student 
body. We appreciate both the public-
ity and the accountability that the 
Guardian provides and hope to fos-
ter this relationship for the duration 
of the SRC.

We hope that soon students will 
understand that if we are the grass, 
they are the roots.

— Elizabeth Elman
Director, Student 

Sustainability Collective

Dear Editor,
George Skelton’s Nov. 22 article 

in the Los Angeles Times titled 
“California budget’s going to be 
dreadful” claimed, “There’s no use 
getting upset about it. Until long-
term structural issues are fixed, there 
is no way legislators can produce an 
honest spending plan so the state 
lives within its means.” 

 What’s all the fuss about and 
what seems to be the problem? All 
we need to do is charge one penny 
per gallon of water, and/or $1 per 
gallon of gas in taxes to rectify 
California’s budget crisis. 

Such an action, although of little 
financial consequence to most, 
would be the beginning of long-term 
water promotion and gas conserva-
tion. It would also provide more 
incentive to develop truly renewable 
forms of energy. 

Global warming and the loss of 
our excellent educational system will 
affect us all, and we should make 
every effort to do what we can to 
prevent this dreadful disaster. Let’s 
all write to our state officials to pro-
mote a real solution.

Root said. 
Ashley Lewis, one of the stu-

dents who filed a letter of grievance, 
claimed the student complaints nega-
tively affected their grades.

“After my classmates and I sub-
mitted our original letter of com-
plaint, our primary instructor was 
evidently so upset that he docked all 
of our final grades by at least one full 
letter,” Lewis said in her letter.

Assistant Deans of External Affairs 
for UCSD Extension Henry DeVries 
said the circumstantial causes for the 
class’s downfalls were unique.

“There was a change of instruc-
tors,” DeVries said. “It was not cur-
riculum or policy which affected this 
class — it was an unforeseen person-
nel change, and in these circumstanc-
es, there are always chances for things 
to fall through the cracks.”

The university responded to the 
complaints with a formal investiga-
tion lead by Interim Register and 
Director of Student Services Elizabeth 
Silva. She addressed the complaints 
by offering extended opportunities 
free of cost to students. These offers 
included online classes, Saturday 
morning workshops and course 
offerings from Fall Quarter 2009 and 
Winter Quarter 2010. 

According to DeVries, four of 
the seven students who filed griev-
ances accepted the offers of extended 
instruction. 

“We listened to the students’ con-
cerns about their lack of training and 
offered them opportunities for fur-
ther education,” DeVries said. “The 
reparations the students were offered 
were very fair and reasonable.”

However, Root said the offers, 
including online classes at Lynda.com 

— valued at $75 each — were both 
“insulting” and a “slap in the face.” He 
claimed the options were not equal in 
monetary value to the tuition paid by 
students for the classes, and that one 
of the classes offered was taught by an 
instructor who the students claimed 
had admitted that he could not teach 
the material adequately.

“I will be pursuing further appeals,” 
Root said in response to the decision. 
“If those do not work, I will pursue legal 
actions. Along the way, I will continue 
to speak out about the poor quality of 
education from the DAC program.”

Students such as Root demand 
monetary compensation, a motion 
the university has denied per the 
UCSD Extension Refund Policy. The 
policy states that students who with-
draw are refunded 75 percent of the 
tuition if they withdraw by second 
week, 50 percent by third week and 
25 percent by fourth week. Since the 
students filing the complaints did not 
withdraw from the class, university 
associates maintain that a refund is 
not possible.

DeVries said that although mon-
etary compensation is unlikely due 
to the policy, the university is still 
concerned about the grievance com-
plaints. He added that major revi-
sions to the DAC courses are unlikely 
since the change of instructors was a 
one-time occurrence. 

“Complaints are rare occurrenc-
es,” DeVries said. “This is rare, but 
when it happens it’s important. Our 
biggest concern is that students get 
the education they need, and we take 
complaints very seriously.”

has been research money allocated by 
UCSD. The application also received 
funding from the Transnational 
Communities Award given by the 
U.S. Embassy in Mexico. 

However, organizations like the 
Center of Immigration Studies — a 
nonprofit group that researches the 
effects of immigration on the U.S. —
vocally disapprove of the application. 

CIS communications associate 
Bryan Griffith said an application 
to identify an individual’s location 
would be used to promote further 
unsafe activity when in the wrong 
hands.

“Anytime people make a high-
technology tool that will identify 
where a person is, I don’t think it will 
be used only to find water,” Griffith 
said. “The tool will not only help ille-
gal immigrants, but help drug smug-
gling and human smuggling.”

According to the U.S. Immigration 
and Nationality Act, anyone helping 
illegal immigration is subject to Title 
8 of the U.S. Code, Section 1324, 
which states that aiding in the trans-
portation of illegal aliens across the 
border is an offense that can poten-
tially lead to fines or imprisonment. 

Stalbaum said legality should not 
be an issue for a “public safety tool.”

“The technology itself isn’t real-

ly useful for navigating and making 
the whole trip into the United States 
from Mexico,” Stalbaum said. “You 
really have to raise questions as to why 
there’s such criticism over a device that 
is really only useful within an hour of 
time and within a couple kilometers 
of safety sites to help someone who’s 
disoriented to get to a water site.”

Researchers are attempting to 
address some problems before the 
release date, such as cost and life span.

“You can install it on a mobile 
phone that is operable — that some-
body could use in an emergency 
situation in the desert — but after a 
couple weeks, that data is going to 
time out because of the stale data 
problem,” Stalbaum said.

The researchers plan to offer the 
tool to various humanitarian and 
church organizations by the end of 
the year at minimal to no cost.

“We’re making all of the software 
available as open source software,” 
Stalbaum said. “We’re providing our 
services at a public university to the 
larger transglobal community, which 
we’re a part of.”

The application has won two 
Transborder Awards from the UCSD 
Center for the Humanities.

Working alongside United 
Students Against Sweatshops — a 
national organization that advocates 
for worker rights — SWS arranged 
an open forum in which two union 
workers from the Jerzees de Honduras 
factory talked about the conditions 
they worked under and how they lost 
their jobs for unionizing.

“I’m really glad that student soli-
darity efforts really helped to boost 
the momentum … to open the fac-
tory again,” A.S. Vice President of 
External Affairs and SWC member 
Gracelynne West said. 

WRC will now monitor the agree-
ments made between the company 

and the union workers and provide the 
involved universities with a follow-up 
report on the implementation process.

“They recognize that it’s a positive 
step for their company,” Nova said. 
“They’ve said that they’re very com-
mitted to this new partnership with the 
union. We’ve been encouraged by what 
they said, and the initial steps they’ve 
taken to implement the agreement.”

If UCSD receives positive reports 
from the WRC on the implementa-
tion progress, Turk said the deci-
sion to send Russell an application to 
renew its license would be forthcom-
ing early next year.

but it’s been something I’ve enjoyed. 
I enjoyed both being a freshman 
and being a senior, but for totally 
different reasons.”

As a freshman, I had no idea 
what to expect. I had all my goals 
laid out, and every time I had a 
question, I just had to ask some-
body. As a senior, I’ve really enjoyed 
being able to answer a lot of those 
questions when the underclassmen 
have them.”

Wright’s learned leadership 
came into play during his last cross-
country race in a UCSD uniform: 
the 2009 NCAA West Regional 
Championships. About one half-
mile into the race, he noticed that 
nearly all his teammates were run-
ning near each other — but not 
together as a group. 

Wright called for them to stay 
together for about a mile of their 
10K race, after which a smaller 
group broke off and kept together 
for more than half the race, helping 
lead his team to a ninth-place finish. 

Individually, Wright finished 43rd 
overall and second on the team. It 
was his best regional finish ever — 

and a fitting 
way to close 
out his UCSD 
career. 

“I could 
see them run-
ning close to 
each other, 
but I’m not 
sure they 
knew they 
were that 
close,” Wright 
said. “I just 
came up to 
them and said 
‘Hey let’s get 
together,’ and 
we fell into a 
pack. I defi-
nitely think 

that helped calm us down and [got] 
us focused early on in the race.”

Wright said he had great respect 
for the Triton seniors he has run 

with over his years on the team, and 
kept them in mind during his final 
season as a Triton.

“No matter what, regardless of 
ability or anything like that, I’ll 
always look up to the upperclass-
men that I ran with,” he said. “The 
knowledge that they imparted on 
me while they were here is invalu-
able.” 

Wright’s favorite moments in his 
UCSD career include breaking four 
minutes in a 1,500-meter race and 
dressing up as the solar system for 
the UCSD Athletic’s annual costume 
contest. Although his four years as a 
member of the Triton cross-country 
team are over, he said he sees him-
self continuing to run long into the 
future. 

“Once I’m done running for the 
university, I can be more flexible,” 
Wright said. “I’d like to branch out 
and try some half-marathons or 
marathons.”

the imaginar ium
of doctor parnassus

the lovely

bones
Jan. 15 — From Peter Jackson, the same 
epic nerd who brought us “Lord of the Rings,” 
comes the haunting story of 14-your-old Susie 
Salmon. After being raped and murdered, the 
littlest angel observes her greiving family from a 
personal heaven as they attempt to solve the mys-
tery of her death. Based on Alice Sebold’s best-
selling novel, the film follows Susie’s father Jack 
(Mark Wahlberg) as he pores obsessively over the 
case, her emotionally unstable mother Abigail 
(Rachel Weisz) and her younger sister, who is 
determined to find out the truth even if it means 
risking her own life. Highlights include Jackson’s 
psychedelic interpretation of Susie’s heaven with 
fantastical cinematography, lush colors and the 
same out-of-this-world vision that made him 
famous. With Stanley Tucci topping off the creepy 
as Salmon’s next-door neighbor, we’re bound to 
get goosebumps — and not the good kind.

DEC. 25 — Even if you, for whatever rea-
son, don’t like strip-free acid trips or aren’t fan of 
midgets, curiosity alone should be enough to pull 

you into “The Imaginarium of 
Doctor Parnassus.” Not to men-
tion, it’s the last movie Heath 
Ledger — our generation’s James 
Dean — will ever appear in. 
After his tragic and untimely 
death, production was put on 
hold until three of his buddies 
(no-big-deal stars Johnny Depp, 
Jude Law and Colin Farrell) took 
it upon themselves to split the 
role and finish up the film. 

Dr. P, played by the versatile 
Christopher Plummer, makes a 
deal with the devil — an always 
outrageous Tom Waits — to 
trade in his daughter for immor-
tality. Mysterious outsider Tony, 
played by all four sexpots, travels 
through magical parallel worlds 
in order to save the girl. 

Written and directed by Terry 
Gilliam, “Imaginarium” is sure 
to be the hallucinogenic jour-
ney of the year. Come on, even 
Verne Troyer — yes, the freakish 
midget from “Austin Powers” — 
stopped by for a cameo. As if we 
didn’t have reason enough to see 
it twice.

— Amanda Martinek
Staff Writer

But on the real: Jason Reitman 
took the best things about “Juno” 
— its heart-wrenchingly human 
conflicts, its compassion, its 
tongue-in-cheeky dialogue (sans 
the forced quirkiness) — and 
cherry-topped the whole thing 
with George Clooney and a 
handful of other unreasonably 
good-looking actors. A film this 
uplifting, this strangely disarming, 
this relevant and even timeless, 
is enough to make an audience 

cry and laugh at the same time 
(just when you thought happy-sad 
must be a promotional myth), and 
sometimes simply stare in a stupe-
fied hush.

Clooney hits top form as the 
self-assured, no-strings Ryan 
Bingham — in essence, corporate 
America’s dreamy hitman. A “ter-
mination specialist,” he’s paid to 
fire people for bosses too spineless 
to do the deed; indeed, it takes a 
steely soul to bear countless tragic 
pleas of the economically down-

trodden. 
But after wrapping up a day of 

tearful, exasperated, how-could-
you-do-this-to-me breakdowns, 
Bingham clicks his briefcase 
closed with a little satisfied smile 
and heads back to the airport, 
unscathed. Striding through metal 
detectors like the drill were a 
cakewalk, he enjoys an in-flight 
lifestyle 322 days out of the year: 
To know him is to fly with him.

Problem is, we’re still half 
crushed — and that’s what makes 

the movie brilliant. Reitman’s con-
stant push and pull from devastat-
ing reality to a slick utopia of tiny 
cocktails and V.I.P. cards leaves 
us vaguely empty and utterly 
absorbed.

The casting ultimately makes 
it work: No one but Clooney 
could have played white-collar 
jet-hopper so charmingly, and no 
one but real people — who really 
got the boot — could have made

 ser ious
moonlight
DEC. 4 — A romantic comedy with one 
too many revenge plots for comfort, “Serious 
Moonlight” takes “All’s fair in love and war” to 
heart (a la “Intolerable Cruelty”), spelling out all 
the reasons not to date a high-powered attorney 
— as if we needed more than one.

A lip-pumped Meg Ryan plays Louise, super-
woman lawyer who finds out her husband Ian 
is having an affair with a young floozy (Kristen 
Bell). Instead of flying into hysterics, Louise has a 
more novel idea: duct-tape him to the toilet and 
hold him hostage until he loves her. 

Hilarity ensues 
(or doesn’t) as 
she-devil attempts 
to reignite the 
spark through 
a parade of old 
wedding footage 
and truly hor-
rific a capella. 

Desperate for freedom, Ian screams for the atten-
tion of neighbors — only to realize he has alerted 
“bad guy” robbers that they’re in the clear. 

While the storyline may be dubious, the 
cast has potential: Ryan, no longer America’s 
sweetheart, tries her hand at domineering bitch, 
while Bell sets aside sass to do dumb blonde. It 
may not have the merit of screenwriter Adrienne 
Shelley’s early work (read: “Waitress”), but it does 
teach a valuable lesson: Before duct-taping your 
estranged husband to a toilet, lock the door.

As the murderous cult leader Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) 
conspires to destroy London, Holmes and Watson team up once 
again to stop evil from running amuck. But don’t expect the same 
fingerprinting and clue-sniffing that rocked you to sleep as a wee 
one. After all, Sherlock 2.0 comes complete with action-packed 
explosions; a hot, half-naked Rachel McAdams; and Jude Law, the 
embodiment of everything sexy in Britain, in the passenger seat. 
Peppered with cheesy quips and shot in picturesque London, direc-
tor Guy Ritchie’s rendering of this sleuthing superstar will knock 
this classic on its ancient butt — and we can’t wait to see it go down.

leaves
of grass

DEC. 25 — Down to spend this 
year’s break getting high to some-
thing other than “Home Alone”? Cue 
Edward Norton, crossbows, Edward 
Norton, mistaken identities, Edward 
Norton talking in a hick accent and 

um, Edward Norton, and you’ve got Tim Blake Nelson’s “Leaves of Grass.” 
Norton plays two parts: a brilliantly blazed Oklahoman and an eloquent Ivy 
League professor who happens to be the pothead’s twin. Enter Susan Sarandon 
and Richard Dreyfuss, and it’s the perfect stoner comedy that isn’t. 

“Pineapple Express” may have taken itself a tad too seriously, but the dead-
pan faces of Norton and Norton on the black-and-white movie poster have us 
wondering if this comedy truly has a dark side. Sure, the trailer promises hilari-
ous hijinks that only a “pair” of charming twins could cause — using mistaken 
identities to their advantage; paying the price — but we hope this buddy flick 
is more than a couple Mary J. jokes and jabs at the intelligentsia and/or corn-
crunchin’ farmers. But seriously — two Edward Nortons. Now that’s hot.

DEC. 18 — Missed out on “The Queen” 
and “Marie Antoinette”? No need to fret — a 
new royalty introspective produced by Martin 
Scorsese is about to be bestowed upon all the 
girly history buffs and costume-drama lovers of 
the world (with emphasis on the word costume, 
not drama). Apparently, Victoria’s life as a young 
woman lacked any significant degree of sub-
stance, although her budding relationship with 
Prince Albert (the focal point of the film) might 
allow a somewhat endearing romantic yarn. 
Mind you, the couple will hardly pose a chal-
lenge to “Pirates” heartthrobs Elizabeth Swan 
and Will Turner, and there will be no convenient 
vampires to perform neck-piercing love scenes. 
So don’t get too excited. Emily Blunt and Rupert 
Friend are sure to steam things up a bit, but it’s 
rumored to be a show-stealing performance for 
Paul Bettany, who plays Prime Minister Lord 
Melbourne. Cheers, mate!

brothers

the young victor ia

DEC. 4 — Though the tell-all trailer for 
director Jim Sheridan’s latest leaves little 
unanswered, there is something about the 
idea of a supposedly dead soldier return-
ing home that leaves us itching to know 
more. The A-list cast doesn’t look half 
bad either. With Tobey Maguire, Natalie 
Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal leading the 
way, we find out what happens when a 
grieving army widow seeks comfort in 
the arms of her deceased husband’s black-
sheep brother. 

But what begins as a post-mortem ther-
apy session quickly transforms into some-
thing else entirely, when the apparently 
“dead” first husband arrives at the front 
door to discover a blossoming romance 
between his wife and brother. Sound 
familiar? That’s probably because it has the 
same exact plot as “Cider House Rules.” 
And “Pearl Harbor.” Oh, Hollywood.

Though hardly groundbreaking, 
Maguire’s post-traumatic stress meltdown 
and consequential shoot-out with the cops 
does look epic, and will undoubtedly earn 
an Oscar nod or two. To hell with origi-
nality.

This weekend, Conrad Prebys’ neglected ancestor of a 
music hall will play host to one of the most controversial, 
rarely performed pieces by late American composing 
legend Leonard Bernstein. Combining the secular 
and sacred, Berenstein’s “MASS: A Theatre Piece for 
Singers, Players and Dancers” was originally performed 
as an anti-Vietnam War statement in the ’70s. The La 
Jolla Symphony teams up with UCSD music icons Ken 
Anderson (gospel-choir guru) and Steven Schick (young-
at-heart percussionist) to bring a taste of retro rebellion 
and progressive composition to UCSD’s original stage. (JS)

A musical in its own right, “Nine” sings and dances its way 
through the midlife crisis of world-renowned Italian film direc-
tor Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis). Drained of creative 
juices and racked with personal strife, the midlife-crisis victim 
juggles the demands of shooting his next film — for which he 
has no script — and his wife of 20 years (Marion Cotillard), 
who is tiring of his absence. Schizophrenic tendencies warp 
Contini’s mind, and his fugitive imagination soon blurs the line 
between reality and fiction. As if within a mid-‘60s Christmas 

Carol adaptation, Contini revisits women of his past whilst 
contending with those of the present: his mistress (Penélope 
Cruz), costume designer (Judi Dench), film star muse (Nicole 
Kidman) and an American fashion journalist (Kate Hudson).

Much in the same vein as Marshall’s 2002 hit “Chicago,” 
“Nine” leverages from ornate costuming, subdued colors, 
flashy dance numbers and an ensemble cast that collectively 
boasts six Oscars.

those blubbering breakdowns so convincing. 
 “We read from a legal form used to fire people,” Reitman 

said, describing how he prompted reactions from people with 
no prior acting experience. “The second they would hear it, 
their eyes would turn red; their postures would change. If 
someone asked me what the worst part was about getting fired, 
I would have said, ‘Loss of income.’ But it’s not the money — 
it’s the lack of purpose. It’s the reason to get out of bed in the 
morning.” 

But the pink-slip moments of outrage aren’t overwhelming 
or overly sentimental; instead, they’re just sporadic enough to 
generate a kind of lingering unrest, framing Bingham’s mildly 
existential journey and reminding us of catastrophes much 
greater than a guy in his 40s who can’t commit. 

Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) plays the stunning female 
counterpart to Bingham’s effortless cool. “Think of me as your-
self, only with a vagina,” she purrs, admiring in equal parts 
his stolen room-key collection and frequent flyer miles. After 
doing the dirty, both flip open their laptops to arrange another 
domestic booty call. 

But Bingham’s world of hotel sex and complimentary pea-
nuts comes to a slamming halt when he’s introduced to Natalie 
Keener (Anna Kendrick), a fresh-faced graduate with ambi-
tions to fire workers without stepping foot on another plane 
again. Using videoconferencing, one needs only to sit at his or 
her computer and read a carefully designed script to break the 
news, hundreds of miles away. 

Of course, her cost-effective plan threatens Bingham’s rose-
tinted universe. Convinced his job is an art form requiring 
more grace and experience than the equivalent of a text-mes-
sage breakup, he dares the naive overachiever to do the nasty 
job herself, face-to-face with a world outside the Ivy League 
nest. His challenge proves transformative for both — in the end, 
all our expectations are shot in a wedding scene that shifts the 
movie from Bingham’s airbrushed, air-conditioned gaze to a 
softer place where real people live, in all their imperfections and 
insecurities.

The perspective shift mirrors Reitman’s own journey while 
conceiving the film. “When I started making movies seven 
years ago, I was a single guy living in an apartment in my 20s; 
I was a contrarian,” he said, chewing a fish taco thoughtfully. 
“But then I became a father, I got a mortgage … Ryan starts to 
recognize similar things that I was recognizing.” 

But the movie doesn’t set out to villainize Bingham for 
shunning his family or refusing a shot at substantial intimacy; 
if anything, the guy’s just too damn likeable to fault. Nor does 
“Up” blindly applaud the sanctity of marriage and feed us an 
easy ending, just in time for the holidays. Instead, it merely sug-
gests that “life’s better with company.” Whether or not you find 
the right co-pilot or crash and burn, remains, well — you get 
where I’m going here.

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE 
FLOWERY GRAVES
Life in San Francisco Births Brokenhearted Honesty from the Kind of  
Pill-Poppers Who Belong at the Loft. By Chris Kokiousis

CONCERTPREVIEW

C hristopher Owens and Chet “JR” White have hit a vein of melan-choly so deep, it’s hard to listen to 
their debut Album in the wrong mood. 
If you’re bummed, Girls’ retro ballads 
might not help; then again, they also 
could be the perfect remedy. Their syr-
upy brand of Cali-pop quivers under 

Owens’ weathered Costello croons for 
some pure, simple pleasures — friends 
forever, a box of pizza and a bottle of 
wine. Heralded as one of 2009’s most 
profound new records, Album is natural, 
elegant and timeless, borrowing the flair 
of rock from the past four decades, but 
managing it within the mellow and jan-

gling reverb sadness/madness that only a 
particularly lovable kind of weirdo could 
cultivate. 

Much has been written about Owens’ 
tragic and fascinating backstory as a 
boy raised in the Children of God cult, 
where he could only listen to certain 
records approved inside the group — 
mostly praise anthems and songs that 
David Berg (the cult’s founder) enjoyed. 

There’s a lot more to Owens’ story — 
a millionaire mentor in Texas, a drug-
addled San Francisco lifestyle, some girl 
problems (obviously) — but it’s Owens’ 
songwritten honesty that saves this 
band from hype overdose. Forlorn cuts 
like “Laura” ride warm, unadorned 
chords from the desperate first verse 
all the way to the “Reach out and touch 
me I’m right here/ And I don’t wanna 
fight anymore” chorus plea. We also 
get a wishlist of all his ex’s luxuries in 
“Lust for Life,” — like a suntan, a beach 
house and a father, to begin.

There’s no irony here, and while the 
band is Girls and the album is Album — 
bringing to mind so much subpar min-
imalist hipster music from this decade 
— Girls are genuine to a refreshing 
fault. With the songs pouring out and 
another LP on the way next year, 
these Bay burnout heroes will bring 
their twisted peace and love to 
the Loft Friday in search of good 
times. So sing along.

Girls will perform live at the 
Loft with the Morning Benders 
on Dec. 4 at 8:30 p.m.

W arren Beatty and Faye Dunaway may have robbed hearts and banks in the 1967 
film “Bonnie and Clyde,” but the 
La Jolla Playhouse’s world-premiere 
musical — based on the bandits’ 
rip-roarin’ life story — runs off with 
more substance and excitement than 
the Hollywood classic. In an emphatic 
departure from the film’s sensational-
ism, director Jeff Calhoun flawlessly 
exposes the raw personal conflicts 
underlying the iconic pair’s life on 
the lam in the Texas Dustbowl. Even 
a slow first act and misplaced, ironi-
cally upbeat song and dance can’t put 
more than a small dent in this mag-
netic ray of sunshine.

We all know the story of Bonnie 
and Clyde: Robin Hood of the 1930s 
— 24-year-old Clyde Barrow — 
wanders debonairly through the cen-
tral states in stolen Ford V8s, living 
off bank holdups. “Everybody’s got 
dreams,” sure, but he’s “got plans,” an 
escapist mentality that draws aspir-
ing poet and fame-monger Bonnie 
Parker to join his crime spree. 
Clyde’s brother Buck and God-fearin’ 
sister-in-law Blanche tag along, and 
the Barrow gang soon steers its way 
atop the nation’s list of public ene-
mies. In the midst of an otherwise 
notorious plot, the musical injects a 
refreshing dose of realism by giving 
voices to Bonnie and Clyde’s worri-
some parents and Bonnie’s deferred 
suitor Ted, who ultimately spear-
heads the police chase for Clyde.

Under the direction of John 
McDaniel, the live instrumental pit 
injects the onstage action with a sense 
of immediacy, while the musical score 
— composed by Frank Wildhorn 
and set to the evocative lyrics of Don 
Black — jumps from one genre to the 
next, giving life to the stagnant Texas 
setting. The melancholy violin vibra-
tos in Clyde’s opening number, “This 
World Will Remember Me,” melt 
away into the pick-me-up staccato of 
drums and distorted electric guitar in 
the foul-mouthed Sheriff ’s manifesto, 
“Long Arm of the Law.” 

Despite their sparseness, ensemble 
routines resuscitate the production, 
giving it back that life-on-the-run feel 
— especially in the first act, which is 
saturated with forcedly gushy strings. 
The chorus transforms into a calico-
swishing Sunday 
parish in “God’s 
Arms Are Always 
Open,” whoopin’ 
and hollerin’ with 
bibles in hand to 
call-and-response 
gospel blues. 

Michael 
Lanning’s dual 
role as preacher and legal judge is a 
subtle critique of religion and judg-
ment by God — a critique supported 
by the starring duo, who advance 
together in an era where “God’s 
dead” and “freedom is something 
we’ve gotta steal.”

Those murky moral questions 
are the grime behind the glitz that 
Calhoun’s production attempts to 
unearth. Whip-cracking sounds 
of shell fire, followed by clouds of 
musky-smelling smoke and oozing 
bloodiness rev up the second act, 
with design by Tobin Ost and Brian 
Ronan. Instead of reveling in the 
“sensationalized bullshit” that turned 

“criminals into heroes,” the musical 
questions Bonnie and Clyde’s tab-
loid celebritydom. The soundtrack 
achieves this especially in “The 
Devil,” when Bonnie’s mother laments 
behind tears that “Love was served up 
every day/When did the Devil take 
my girl away? ... What changes a rose 
into a thorn/When did my baby doll 
get tossed and torn?”

 The production is still anchored 
by its antiheroes’ bold romance, tug-
ging on all the strings of a sappy chick 
flick — but a damn good one. Clyde 
serenades Bonnie with an endear-
ing love ballad on the ukulele that 
could very well be Jason Mraz’s next 
hit. Add Stark Sands’ striking resem-
blance to Michael Cera, and presto! 
You’ve got yourself an edgy tearjerker.

The award-winning actors chan-
nel a good 
chunk of the 
same celebrity 
that canonized 
Bonnie and 
Clyde. Laura 
Osnes, winner of 
2007 NBC reality 
show “Grease: 
You’re the One 

That I Want,” diligently portrays 
Bonnie, exuding redheaded fieriness 
as inextinguishable from memory 
as her wide range of voice. A Texas 
native himself, Tony Award nominee 
Sands delivers a well-tempered and 
palpable Clyde, who never goes over 
the top with the Southern twang. 
The real show-stoppers, though, are 
Melissa van der Schyff and Mare 
Winningham, who play Blanche 
and Bonnie’s mom, respectively. As 
comic relief, Van der Schyff ’s Lord-
praisin’ Blanche is a needed break 
from the morally heavy production.

The most artistically daring and 
successful ploy, however, is not deliv-

ered by the actors. Designer Aaron 
Rhyne’s backdrop projection screen 
links history to fiction, interpolating 
scenes on stage with actual photos 
from the 1930s, including mug shots 
and Bonnie and Clyde’s facetious 
modeling for the camera. 

Toward the end of the first act, 
bright-eyed Bonnie and ambitious 
Clyde chime in unison, “‘Helluva 
ride’ will be on our epitaph” — and 
indeed, this ride is as wild as their 
stiff musical genre could ever hope 
to become.

WINTER e�MOVIE e PREVIEW

DEC. 25 — Alec Baldwin trades 
in the under-the-breath cynicism of 
“30 Rock’s” Jack Donaghy for far less 
abrasive schemes of chivalry in this 
Christmas day release. Complications 
arise when Baldwin steps into the mid-
dle of a budding relationship between 
two of Hollywood’s other cash cows, 
Meryl Streep and Steve Martin, birth-
ing a star-struck love triangle.

Like all good divorcees with 
three children, Jane (Streep) and 
Jack (Baldwin) have separated ways, 
buried the hatchet and let bygones be 
bygones. Ten years later though, their 
son’s graduation reunites the indepen-

dent-minded baker with her attorney 
ex-husband, who’s by now remarried a 
hot thing of his own (Lake Bell). Any 
other genre would portray the reunion 
as a highly awkward affair, but this is 
a romantic comedy — and a Nancy 
Meyers one, at that. Accordingly, a 
plot twist of family ties ensues à la 
director/ producer/ screenwriter’s 
Nancy Meyers“Something’s Gotta 
Give” and “The Parent Trap.” And 
so, as the divorcees’ innocent dinner 
rekindles romance, it threatens to 
undermine Jack’s marriage and Jane’s 
relationship with Adam (Martin), 
an architect who she’s contracted to 

remodel her kitchen. 
Undoubtedly, the film will, once 

again, laud Streep for the acting cha-
meleon she is and exhibit yet more 
of her recent shift toward less Oscar-
worthy, more commercial blockbuster 
roles. The film will also be a must-see 
for Academy Awards geeks. With 
the male leads, Baldwin and Martin, 
slated to co-host next year’s show, 
think of “It’s Complicated” as a pocket 
guide to the jokes likely to be cracked 
among the silver screen elite, come 
Oscar night.

it's complicated

DEC. 11 — The fashion world’s 
McSteamy, the sunglassed Tom 
Ford, steps behind the camera for 
the first time with “A Single Man,” 
a film that has already generated 
significant Oscar buzz for its “great 

sensitivity” and for leading actor 
Colin Firth’s “moving performance” 
as gay and grieving 52-year-old pro-
fessor George Falconer, suffering in 
a world that cannot make room for 
homosexuality. The story begins as 
Falconer attempts to live out a day 
of his life as normally as possible, 
suppressing the fact that his lover of 
16 years has just died in a car crash. 

Set in LA in the 1960s, it is the 
heyday of Hitchcock, Mad Men and 
Audrey Hepburn. Ford’s world is 
clean-cut, sophisticated and glossy 
in the most precise ways. It will be 

interesting to see if his attempt at 
poetic sensitivity falls short, how-
ever, due to the acclaimed designer’s 
innate need to sweep all the ugliness 
away. We’ll certainly be left with 
something pretty, but the unrealistic 
ideal may not appeal to everyone. 

Ford and Firth may present some 
of the most exquisitely tailored mis-
ery out there, but hopefully we won’t 
find ourselves yearning for a fray — 
after all, it’s in the unraveling that the 
most real unhappiness dwells.

  A SIMPLE

MAN

verge of a mental breakdown or 
starting an on-court fight. Baseball 
might have Milton Bradley’s temper 
tantrums, but the NBA has Chris 
Andersen and his pure insanity.
3. Super Bowl commercials 

Notice, please, that I am not 
including professional football on 
this list. It’s sad but true: The televi-
sion advertisements between plays 
have become more important than 
the game’s championship show-
down. The NFL has become a bas-
tion for overpaid and uncoopera-
tive egos (read: Michael Crabtree, 
Terrel Owens, Chad “Eighty-Five,” 
Jerry Jones and about half the 
Cowboys’ roster). This football 
season will most likely close with 
a classic Peyton Manning-Tom 
Brady matchup at some point, and 
perhaps a game-winning field goal 
somewhere between unnecessary 
clumps of timeouts and official 
breaks. But for what it’s worth, the 
big boys in the NFL have very little 
to offer. 

So feel free to space out until 
the Super Bowl approaches, then 
tune in and gear up for a real slice 
of Americana — normally a toss-up 
between a busty Go-Daddy girl or 
E-Trade’s talking babies.
4. Winter general-manager meetings 

You didn’t expect to actually go 
an entire six months without ever 

thinking about baseball, did you? 
After a few months of withdrawal, 
the winter general-manager meet-
ings is just the fix I need. 

Throw 30 baseball executives 
together in a hotel, let them trade 

players as if 
they were 
corn-stock 
commodities 
and it will 
produce more 
than enough 
headlines to 
keep your 
Google alerts 
working over-
time. 

Thanks to 
the meetings, 
you’ll have 
enough read-
ing to keep 
you busy until 
pitchers and 
catchers report 
for spring 
training. 

Which 
team will Scott Boras swindle into 
signing Jason Bay and Matt “Good 
Thing I Remembered to Wear My 
Cup” Holliday? Will Pedro Martinez 
decide to skip out of the AARP line 
and have another go at being New 
York’s daddy? Personally, I just want 
to see if San Francisco general man-

ager Brian Sabean takes a page out 
of his Cy Young winner’s playbook 
and tokes up at the meeting to cel-
ebrate a blockbuster deal.  
5. March Madness 

Just as baseball’s spring training 
is moving into first gear, college bas-
ketball will be the perfect substitute 
for the stretch run. I’ll never under-
stand it, but year after year, it seems 
that every single March Madness 
game unfailingly ends with a thrill-
ing buzzer-beating shot soaring 
through the air and swishing into 
the net, setting off a swarm of crazed 
college students and creepy mascots. 

Hyperboles aside, the beautiful 
65-team dance is easily the non-
baseball sports highlight of the 
year (No. 5 on this list solely for 
chronological consistency). Who 
will be this year’s 12-5 upset? Can 
the Kansas Jayhawks run the table? 
Just how freakin’ old is Dick Vitale? 
Somehow, Cinderella shows up at 
the big dance every year, and — 
pumped with March Madness spirit 
— never fails to put out.

So there you are: five solid rea-
sons to keep your head above water 
this offseason, and away from a 
Prozac addiction. Life may seem a 
bit more bleak without the joy that 
a 162-game baseball season brings, 
but hang in there, follow up on my 
top five and just remember: only 123 
days until Opening Day, 2010.

Last week, the 2009 baseball season came to an end with the announcement of the 
Most Valuable Player and Cy Young 
awards, marking the start of the six 
longest months of every baseball fan’s 
year: the offseason. For over half a 
year, we watched teams evolve as 
they transitioned from spring train-
ing to the dog days of summer and 
an eventual pennant race. As the 

postseason wound down, we turned 
to our national pastime to keep us 
distracted from the decaying world 
around us. The Yankees’ Evil Empire 
was kind enough to take a break 
from counting their piles of cash to 
let a pair of World Series games slip 
to the Phillies, keeping the baseball 
season on life support for a few more 
moments. 

But — like all good things in life 
— the season came to an end. Now, 
baseball fans have reverted back to 
post-breakup 16-year-old emotional 
states; looking back over old pictures, 
rereading old baseball articles and 
piecing together the previous year to 
see where we went wrong. 

The main difference is that when 
Chelsea Huang broke up with me 
sophomore year in high school, she 
made it pretty clear that we were 
through forever. With baseball, I get 
the satisfaction of knowing that, in 
only six short months, I will form 
a beautiful and compassionate rela-
tionship with the sport all over again.

But what am I supposed to do in 
the meantime? Instead of binging 
on nachos and garlic fries to drown 
my off-season tears, I plan, instead, 
to find solace in the sloppy seconds. 
Here are my five top picks:
1. College football 

Aside from the Florida Gators’ 
run at their second-straight national 
championship, the 2009 season has 
delivered plenty of surprises. If, like 
me, you’re sad that you can no lon-
ger watch baseball rivalries like that 
between the Giants and Dodgers, the 
Civil War Game between Oregon and 
Oregon State on Dec. 3 for the Pac-
10 title and Rose Bowl birth should 
provide enough drama to make 
Ralph Branca jealous. Heated rival-
ries not cutting it? Try your hand 
at guessing how many sweater vests 
Ohio State head coach Jim Tressel 
owns.
2. Chris Andersen

If you ever get a pang of nos-
talgia for baseball’s drama kings 
— or queens, in the case of Manny 
Ramirez — just keep tabs on the 
Denver Nuggets’ unpredictable cen-
ter, Chris “Birdman” Andersen. Once 
a top prospect, Birdman spiraled out 
of the NBA due to a crack addiction. 
Now a celebrated graduate of rehab, 
the oh-so-tatted Andersen is back 
as a successful member of a Nuggets 
squad looking to reach the NBA 
Finals. 

Playing just over 20 minutes a 
game while contributing an average 
5.9 points, 6.3 boards and 1.6 blocks 
a night, Birdman finally has the pro-
ductivity level to match his eccentric 
behavior — he always seems on the

JOSHUA MEADOR/GUARDIAN

Considering the depend-ability and endurance that Warren College senior Mike Wright 
showed during his stellar four-year 
career on the UCSD cross-country 
team, it may come as a surprise 
that he started off as a sprinter.

Wright began his competitive 
running career speeding through 
races measured by hundredths of  
seconds on his junior-high track 
team. After moving on to high 
school, however, he found the fur-
ther he ran, the luckier he got. So 
he tried his legs at cross country.

“I went out for the track team 
with the idea of being a 400-meter 
runner,” Wright said. “But as 
the distances increased, I would 
perform better, [so] I gradually 
became a distance runner.”

After running with the track 
team at Ponderosa High School 
in Shingle Springs, Calif., Wright 
was persuaded by some of the 
long-distance runners on his team 
to join the school’s cross-country 

team. This, he knew, would be a 
crucial step in his future as a run-
ner. 

Wright’s team lacked plans for 
weekend or summer training, so 
he challenged his team to new 
limits by increasing their weekly 
training mileage from about 40 
miles to 100 miles.

As a junior, Wright and class-
mate Dillon Brook began to 
organize runs for the team on off-
days. The team visibly improved 
— as did its top two runners. By 
his senior year, the Ponderosa 
Bruins were in a position to com-
pete for a spot at the California 
Interscholastic Federation state 
championships. In what Wright 
calls the highlight race of his high-
school career, Ponderosa went into 
the San Joaquin section finals with 
a spot in the CIF championship on 
the line. 

 “Our whole high-school 
career, a school called Oak Ridge 
had dominated our league,” Wright 
said. “At section finals my senior 

year, we beat them for the first 
time, and got to take the last spot 
to state championships.”

Once the dust had settled after 
the thrilling finals victory, Wright 
looked for ways to continue his 
cross-country career. After a gru-
eling college search, Wright chose 
UCSD because of its location and 
top-notch academics and athletics. 

Like all cross-country hopefuls, 
Wright arrived on campus more 
than a month before classes  to try 
out for the team. At first, he was 
shocked at the step up in intensity 
of college workouts, but eventu-
ally eased into the routine with the 
help of the UCSD coaching staff.

“The warm-ups we were doing 
for our workouts were as long 
as what I would do for an entire 
workout in high school,” he said.

In the end, Wright survived the 
extra mileage, made the team and 
went on to have a stellar freshman 
season. He competed in almost 
every meet, finishing the season 
at the NCAA Division-II West 

Regional Championships with the 
sixth best time for UCSD. 

After his freshman campaign, 
Wright became an established 
member of the squad, continuing 
to improve through his sophomore 
year. But his breakout perfor-
mance came his junior year, when 
he made an impressive showing 
at the West Regionals, finishing 
third on the team and 45th overall. 
Wright’s achievements did not go 
unnoticed — he was named the 
team’s most-improved runner at 
the end of the season. 

This year, he inherited a sig-
nificant leadership role on the 
team after senior Daniel Anderson 
suffered an early-season injury, 
leaving Wright as the team’s only 
competing senior on the 2009 
roster.

“It’s definitely a different expe-
rience being a senior,” Wright said. 
“There are a lot more responsibili-
ties associated with the seniority,
