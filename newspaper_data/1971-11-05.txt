Mixed reactions from 
faculty to Muir Report 

Amid charges that the Muir 
College Commission has 
exceeded its mandate, the 
faculty was presented with the 
Commission's report Tuesday 
afternoon. 

The late afternoon meeting 
was attended by approximately 
40 faculty membe~s and 100 
students. Provost John Stewart 
turned the meeting over to Dr. 
Manuel Rotenberg, who as 

that the report contained no 
information concerning the 
composition of the student body 
of the college. 

Chairman Rotenberg replied 
that the information Helstrom 
wanted was available but was 
not included in the report 
because much of it was 
confidential. Rotenberg 
explained that the Commission 
made recommendations after 
getting approval from Provost 
itewarl. Stewart explained 
that commission members 
asked to be able to make 
recommendations because they 
feft that the report would have 
more value if the 
commissioners could 
recommend changes in the 
college plan based on the 
knowledge they acquired in 
researching the report. 

Physics Professor Frank 
Halpern said that he felt the 
report's recommendations 
should not be accepted. He saia 
he felt the commission was 
attempting to force a plan upon 
the faculty . 

Several faculty members 
criticised the emphasis on 
procedure. and urged the 
faculty to consider the report 
on its own merits. Commission 
member and student Ian 
Boase, said that studies have 
been made for several years, 
and eventually the faculty 
"will have to consider 
changes." 

After an hour and a half of 
discussion. Stewart asked the 
faculty to decide whether to 
adjourn the meeting or to 
accept the report. Helstrom 
moved that the faculty meet on 
Nov . 16 to discuss the 
philosophy of the college in 
executive ession. Literature

University of California, San Diego· Friday, November 5, 1971 
I. BACKGROUND 

The Aptil 20, 1971, meeting of 
the faculty of John Muir 
College approved the formation 
of a commission " to examine 
the operation of the John Muir 
curriculum" and report to the 
faculty concerning its findings 
early in the Fall of 1971. 

The commission was charged 
with a broad range of tasks. 
Initially, it was to be a fact-
finding board looking into the 
problems of course offerings 
and requirements, and their 
administration . Half-way 
through the summer, it was 
realized that it would be 
difficult to limit the 
commission 's activities to fact-
finding only, and Provost 
Stewart broadened the task to 
include recommendations. 

This report outlines the 
Commission 's findings 
concerning course offerings 
and requirements , and 
concludes with 
recommendations for Muir 
College's future system of 
course requirements and their 
administration. 
II. INFORMATION 

COLLECTION 
In order to collect 

information concerning the 
functioning of the Muir 
curriculum, a variety of 
sources of data were used. 
With the assistance of Jannett 
Klinke , members of the 
commission individually made 
eight visits to different Muir 
houses to discuss informally 
the students ' opinions 
concerning the curriculum. 
Three afternoon sessions Were 
held by the commission in the 
Muir Commons and interested 
off-campus Muir students were 
invited to participate. A simple 
course and teaching evaluation 
questionnaire was distributed 
to students in all Muir lower-
division course . The 
commission also held a joint 
meeting with college advisory 
staff (Hazel Alksnis. Nancy 
Groves. and Mary Avery) . a 
second joint meeting with 
Professors M. Benamou 
(Professor of French 
Literature l, Lola Schwartz 
(Director of InterdiSCiplinary 
Sequences l. and L. Newmark 
(Chairman of the Department 
of Linguistics), and a third 
meeting to discuss admission 
and transfer problems with Mr. 
Harold Temmer. 

III . SOME SUBSTANTIVE 
CONCLUSIONS 

The conclusions we have 
reached are based on a 
reasonably broad spectrum of 
information. Most of these 
conclusions will come as no 
surprise to the college . 
Although members of the 
commission differed somewhat 
in some of their initial views 
about the college curriculum. 
the views expressed here 
emerged as a relatively clear 
consensus by all the members 
of the commission - faculty . 
starr-and student . 

1. In di cussion with 
students. e p cially in informal 
gath ring . we have found 
antipathy toward the existing 
Muir College requir ment . 
Th rea ons for thi antipathy 
range from highl y 
philo ophical arguments 
con rning th student's right 
to complet fr dom . to 
pecific complaints about th 

lack of organization or 
r tiona I for peciflc cour

2. Th mo t commonly tat d

Muir Commission Report 
the lack of any consistently 
articulated philosophy of the 
college. While many of the 
students were attracted to the 
catalog description of Muir 
College , most voiced 
considerable disappointment in 
the discrepancy between the 
philosophy described in the 
catalog and the facts of course-
taking. 

3. Another clearly presented 
objection given by students 
involves the uneven character 
of required college courses. 
While some of the required 
college courses were thought to 
be well taught, many students 
complained with passion .abo~t 
the poor quality of teachmg m 
specific courses. During the 
course of our inquiry, we noted 
that good courses were rarely 
counted as an argument for 
having requirements. while 
bad courses were almost 
always counted as clear 
reasons for Dot having 
requirements. 

4. The major criticisms of 
students tended to be slightly 
different for each of the 
current required areas .

The responsibilities of the 
Board are to: 

a. consult with department 
chairmen and their 
representatives to develop new 
lower division sequences and to 
determine whieh existing 
courses can be arranged into 
lower-division Sequences for 
the Muir College General 
Education scheme. 

b. to assess the functioning 
and integration of the various 
parts of the curriculum. The 

Board would incorporate 
student and faculty evaluations 
in their assessment. 

c. develop administra ti , ,!

students can have a

d. seek ways to improve the 
quality of teaching in the

e. report to the Provost and 
faculty at least once a year. 

We believe this plan for the 
Mu ir College General 
Education requirements not 
only recognizes the faculty :s 
responsiblity to see that MUIr 
students have a certain breadth 
of knowledge. but also allows 
flexibility for each student to 
choose an appropriate program 
of study. The large selection of 
courses provides the 
advantages of the free market 
place in which well-taught 
courses are rewarded by hjgh 
enrollment. It also avoids the 
difficulties which seem always 
to accompany courses with 
captive audiences . The 
creation of the board provides 
a mechan ism for the 
introduction of new course 
and teaching idea , within a 
fixed framework , as well as 
providing a monitor to 
maintain the quality of the 
Gen ral Education program. 



Med scho'ol doctor dies 
Dr. Leonard David Garren, 

43, an internationlllly known 
medical researcher and one of 
the first faculty members of 
the UCSD School of Medicine,

Speaking oC Dr. Garren 's 
death, Clifford Grobstein, dean

hormone action. His research 
work will be carried on by the 

te~m he headed. Dr. Garren 
will be missed by his 
colleagues and his students, 
wbo Cound him stimulating and 
knowledgeable, as well as a 
warm and kind human being."

Carr, Simms, Bradley, detained 
for two days No charges filed 

Three UCSD students were arrested Monday night on 
suspicion of armed robbery and released Wednesday afternoon 
without formal charges being filed . Ken Carr, Herb Bradley 
and Paul Simms were stopped by the police in Pacific Beach 
Monday night for a routine traffic violation, ending up in jail 
for crimes which never occurred. 

An auto driven by Carr was stopped about 10 p.m. and 
according \.0 Carr the police officer said he was driving 38 mph 
in a 35 mph zone. Carr said the (!Olice car had been following 
him for several blocks. The officer then asked to see Carr 's 
license and also identification from the other two students in 
the car. Carr was then told that one of his rear lights did not 
have a red cover and that was a violation of the vehicle code. 

Carr had a gun on the seat of his car which was registered to 
him. The gun was not loaded. but Carr had a clip in his pocket. 
After being frisked the officer told Carr he was being arrested 
on a state narcotics violation for failure to appear on a traffic 
offense and for suspicion of armed robbery. 

Frantic efforts by administrators and students of Third 
College to secure the release of the three were begun 

Budget (onsideralion delayed 

immediately . Several attorneys , including former Superior 
Court Judge Roger Ruffin, attempted to obtain information 
concerning the charges on which the three were being held. 
Wednesday morning the three were scheduled to appear at 
their arraignment. Carr said he was led into the courtroom at9 
a.m. and immediately taken back to jail. 

The courtroom was filled with interested Third College 
students by the 10 a.m. hearing time Wednesday, but Carr, 
Simms and Bradley were never brought in . 

Late Wednesday afternoon the three were finally released 
without any formal charges being brought against them. Third 
College"Dean Pascual Martinez told the TRITON TIMES that 
the police said it is "standard provedure" to arrest persons 
when they are found with a weapon in their possession. San 
Diego Police Department declined to comment on the episode. 

Carr told the TRITON TIMES that he doesn 't know what 
action will be taken by him at this time. He said there has been 
a great deal of harrassment of Black students recently by the 
San Diego Police, and he wants to check into the matter 
further . 

(omm Board lifts (razy Times Suspension 
The CRAZY TIMES won an 

end to its publishing suspension 
as a result of this Wednesday's 
meeting of the 
Communications Board. The 
Board, composed of faculty , 
administration and student 
representatives , recommended 
an end to the suspension that 
was put on the CRAZY TIMES 
last summer. Confirmation of 
the Board's recommendation 
by Chancellor York is 
considered routine. 

Other business before the 
Board, including the funding of 
the TRITON TIMES, was put 

off until next Monday 's 
meeting. Subsidiary media, 
including the Crazy Times and 
DIMENSION, may also be 
considered at that time. 

The meeting was held in an 
atmosphere of acrimony and 
disorder that has come to mark 
the Board 's meetings recently. 
The two-hour session was 
almost entirely taken up with 
consideration of a June, 1971 
issue of the Crazy Times. A 
front-page story in that issue 
called for a " shutting down " of 
a Navy research lab. The story 
went on to say that this

The Politics of Decay 
Kevin Olson 

Somewhere, out in the student world of unreason, one 
Marcus Woersching has risen up and attempted to criticize my 
review of Tile Greenial of America (DIMENSION, Oct. 20 ). 
Excluding the profound nastiness emanating from his pen in 
the form of ad bominem attacks on DIMENSION the 
conservative movement, and its campus proponents, I se~se an 
attempt to arrive at serious intellectual conclusions regarding 
the Ideas of Mr. Cha~les Reich, and thus feel obligated to reply 
to hIS attacks. A pomt - by - point refutation is not the most 
exciting literary style. but is necessa ry in this case. lest the 
reader be left with the erroneous impression that any of Mr. 
Woersching 's criticisms are valid. To begin : 

(1 ) Consciousness III is anti-historical. It is anti-historical 
because it is unswervingly and profoundly anti-intellectual, 
especially to the kind of intellect that deals with the concept of 
rational , linear progress in human events, and that is the stuff 
of history. III would think it heretical to go to the library and 
look up the history of the Vietnam war ; he would prefer to 
listen to an anti-war rock song. 

(2) Consciousness III is an ti-traditional. for more or less the 
same reasons. Indeed, if one set out to deliberately define a 
culture whose standards would be point - by - point in direct 
opposition to the traditions of Western civilization, he could not 
surpass Con Ill. The basis of the West for hundreds of years has 
been the notion of linear progress based on the primacy of 
reason in human events; Con III, with his flowers , bell-
bottoms, and chemical happiness. seems rather oblivious to 
this . 

(3) Consciousness 111 is necessarily nihilist, because it 
believes in (a) "a doctrine which denies any objective ground 
of truth " and (b) " the doctrine that conditions in the social 
organization are so bad as to make destruct ion desirable for its 
own sake. independent of any constructive program" 
(Webster 's New Collegiate. (951 ), Con III is constantly on the 
search for a "new " experience, be it drugs or mysticism or 
perv.ersion. that will allow him an escape from "objective" 
realIty. LIsten to III babble on about how horrible wars and 
hate and violence are. then ask him what should be done about 
the treatment of Jews in Russia. You will get a blank stare. 

(4 ) Consciousness III does reject, at least implicitly, the 
tradition of rational discourse . With typically breathtaking 
superficiality. Mr. Woersching totally missed the point in my 
quote from Reich. My purpose was not to judge the merits of 
Nelson Rockefeller , but to show the idocy of Ill 's 
reason transcending " new knowled e" : 

" ... I1I does not ' know' the facts, but still knows the truth 
that seems hidden from others . .. One of the ways of 
describing this "new knowledge " is to say that it is capable of 
ignoring categories. We are all limited in our thinking by 
artifical\y drawn lines : we cannot get beyond the idea that a 
university is 'private property' or that prose is different from 
poetry. When the category barriers are removed , ' new 
relationships are seen. But the 'new knowledge ' is more than 
this . it is as if everything. from political affairs to esthetics, 
were seen with new eyes: the young people of Consciousness 
III see effortlessly what is phony or dishonest in politics, or 
what is ugly and meretricious in city planning, whereas an 
older person has to go through years of education to make 
himself equally aware. It might take a Con III person twenty 
years of readinll radical literature to know that law is a tool of 
oppression. the young drug user just 'knows ' it. " 

What will it take , Mr. Woersching, to make you realize what 
preposterous nonsense this is? This " new knowledge" is 
nothing more than the simple fact that ignorant prejudice is 
occasionally correct. A distrust of reason is not justified by 
citing. as you do. bad examples of reason used to justify the 
Vietnam war. It used to be that. if one reasoned like Professor 
Reich, they questioned his professional qualifications. now 
they publish him in Tbe New Yorker and at Random House. 

(5 ) With regard to technology. Mr. Woersching shows 
himself to be a master of the cliche and nothing else. Yes. 
technology has done harm to our environment. but our 
problems will not be solved by people grooving on acid and 
working when they feel like it : " ... a Consciousness 1lI person 
could work in a steel mill . provide<! the dehumanizing aspects 
of the work are reduced as much as possible ... a 
Consciousness III person in his off hours would have to take a 
walk in the natural surroundings of a park ... or li sten to some 
music or read some good literature". Oh happy, happy steel 
worker , playing among his Bessemers with his bellbottoms and 
his dope. watching the molten steel make psychedelic patterns 
before his eyes. I do hope. Mr. Woersching. that you do not plan 
to go into medicine. 

16 ) Mr. Woersching does not believe my statement that 
Greening got unfavorable reviews from the literary 
Establishment. and a ks me to be more pecific on what major 
journals published negative reviews. Very well. Tbe Greening 
of America was reviewed unfavorably in Time, Newsweek, 
Tbe New York Times, Commentary, The New York Review of 
Books, The ew Republic, Commonwealtb, America, The 
Nation , Book World, The New Leader , National Review. 
Ramparts, The Village Voice, The Vale Daily News, The ew 
Yorker, and Dimension. 

In Il n ral. Mr. R i h has tar ted wtth a s ri s of vii no one

Letters to the Editor 
Term Papers 

Richard Drom's article 
("50% of Students, TT Oct. 26 ) 
is an interesting analysis of an 
old academic problem -
cheating. " Pressures and the 
Unive rsity structure" a re cited 
as the two main causes for 
cheating among University 
s tudents . I have no quarrel with 
this. 

Having spent some yea rs in 
college and the University I 
would like to express my belief 
that another major source of 
dishonesty in colleges and 
universities is the structuring 
of most classes around the 
term paper, especially in the 
so-called " humanities" or 
" liberal art" subjects. 

Under our Io-week quarter 
sys tem, students have 
insufficient time to prepare 
honest, well-researched papers 
for the several courses usually 
requiring uch paper from 
them. The problem IS 
aggrava ted if the teacher 
assigns topics two or three 
we ks aft r the quarter begms. 
and /or requ st th fini hed 
product two or three weeks 
before the final exammation, 
The con equence i that the 
tud nt fe I forced to use 

so mebod V else 's work with 
,lIttle or 'no foot not crerlir ' i 
the tudent acted honestly he 
would hav to nclose within 
quotation mark practtcally 
th entire paper. bVIOU Iy. 

' thI would-be unacceptabl 
Questton ' I the term paper 

ab 'o lut 1,- nece ary In 

practically every liberal arts 
class to evaluate a student's 
capacity or performance? 

Personally. I believe that 
term paper writing has 
degenerated generally. though 
not in all cases. to little more 
than a test of the student 's 
typing ability.

Sincerely yours, 
Robinson R. Herrera 

Graffiti 
Mr. Hamilton's article on 

graffiti (TT, Fri .. Oct. 29 ) was 
mildly humorous but slightly ' 
misleading. Graffiti is by no 
mean s " a little -known 
subculture." It ha been around 
ever since the Old Testament 
times when God warned a king 
with the words - which 
app ared on the wall - " mene, 
mene. tekel parsin" (rough 
translation ' " You have be n 
weighed in the scales and found 
wanting." I Th very word 
it ell is derived from the 
Greek , meaning " mark ," 
.. write. " or " draw ": 
archeologists have been ustng 
th word for a long tIme 
th m lve to name drawing 
and writing which appear on 
the walls of ancient building .

Santana an atz 
DonSpeliens 

For more !,han two years now I've been an avid Santana fan : 
not the kind who listens to their albums anywhere from 2-5 
times a day when they' re first released. but only once-a.<Jay 
everyday for the next six months. Those of you who like Carlos 
and Group will be able to relate to that, I think. Well , guess 
what folks? They 've just released their third album on 
Columbia Records IKC 30595), so you know what I've been 
listening to lately. The album is entitled, simply, "Santana." 

Side one opens with an instrumental , "8atuka," which segs 
right into what may be the group's AM chart-buster (!), with 
Rolie on vocals, "No One to Depend On." Santana then does a 
very mediocre transition into their sort SpaniSh - sounding 
song. Each of their albums has at least one like that, "Taboo." 
The side ends with a rousing instrumental , "Toussaint 
L'Overture." in which Carlos and Neil Schon each do some 
showing off with some tasty guitar solos. Unfortunately, 
though, the production is horrid, and the music, mostly the 
percussion. almost completely falls apart at the end of the 
piece. U's really too bad, too. becuase this song has perhaps the 
most pleasing melody to listen to on the album . 

When you turn the album over. things change a bit. In the 
first song. " Everybody 's Everything," for the first time on 
record, we hear the Santana band with brass accompaniment. 
The horns are done by the Tower of Power people, an East Bay 
grease band, and finally you can hear all of the instruments 
playing on the song. Next is another traditionally Spanish -
sounding piece. "Guajira ." that contains some surprisingly 
good vocals, and , yes friends . the Santana band CD sing 
harmonies. Another instrumental. "Jungle Strut," follows : a 
song in the true Santana style of heavy percussion and wailing 
guitar. 

'EverytbiDg's Comia' Our Way' 
The next track, " Everything's Comin' Our Way." doesn't 

even sound like Santana until the guitar part takes over. Jose 
Areas, the timbales player. shows his skill on the f1ugelhorn on 
this cut as he does when the Ilroup performs live and this song 
is no doubt the most original and imaginative on the album. 
Carlos wrote it. arranlled it. and plays acoustic and electric 
guitars. Greg Rolie plays a nice organ piece on the song. and 
the vocals are again good. 

Like I said. they can sing harmonies! Unfortunately. though. 
the mix is terrible. and at times the musicianship becomes 
very sloppy. They close the album with an abbreviated jam. 
"Para Los Rumberos." in which Areas. Rolie. and Santana do 
repetitive and relatively unimaginative solos around a wailing 
trompeta. 
The album is average. But you see. Santana's sound 

generates quite a lot of excitement in th listener , and for that 
I like the record. I've alwavs liked the band for that. What 
really upsets me is that tho'ugh the material is all right. the 
engineering stinks. You 'd think that a band that already has 
two gold records would want their n xt product to be as perfect

as possible. This one isn't. It seems to me that. even though it 
was a year belween albums, perhaps they just didn't take 
enough time putting this new one to~ether. Of course. if 
you 're a Santana fan, you'Ulike the album anyway. If you 're 
not or never have been a Santana fan, you still might like the 
album just like a former Santana - hater friend of mine. At any 
rate , at least take a listen to it. Actually, you probably won't be 
able to keep from hearing it : it went on Billboard's charts at 
No. 13, and , in one week, it sold more than $1 million worth. 

See Tllem Live 
The recording medium doesn't usually compliment bands, 

and this album is no exception. The last time I saw Santana 
was a year ago in San Francisco with Dr. John. I can 't even 
begin to say how much better they are in a live setting. They're 
going to be at the Arena on Nov. 5, and 20 if you get the cbance, 
try to see the show. It should be a good one. 

**** 
Another new release on the Columbia label is " Warren 

Schatz Ie 30685) . The protagonist from New York sings. 
writes, and plays guitar and piano. ,\11 of the songs on the 
album are original. though many sound quite a bit alike ... 

pro~ably because he plays in the same key quite frequently. 
His piano is nice, but not anything to rave about. and I'm 
tempted to say the same about his gaitar playing. The words to 
his songs are simple and in places. almost too mundane. And 
his voice, though pleasant to listen to, sounds hauntingly 
familiar. 

But the album isn't that bad to listen to. Some of the 
melodies are nice. The orchestrations are better than average. 
but the highlight to the album is the chorus which sparkles with 
jewels like Clydie King, who has sung with such artists as 
Quincy Jones and Roberta Flack , and another sliver - throat, 
Patrice Holloway. If you like contemporary. "easy listening" 
music. you 'll enjoy Warren Schatz.

What we have in Reich's solution - the lifestyle of 
Consciousness III - is a clear repudiation of the fundamental 
principles, political and philosophic, on which not only the 
gover,lIDent of this country but the entire structure of Western 
demicracy has been erected.I1I is taught to despair of the idea 
of representative government without being given a clear idea 
of what is to replace it, to dismiss entirely the efforts of the 
generations preceding his, to "liberate" the human being by 
loosening those social restraints that make man civilized. That 
is why, wilen ] look at Woodstock - Altamont, ] do not see the 
culture that is going to save us from the apocalypse , but rather 
ocholcracy : the Germanic barbarians overTUning the Ruins of 
Rome. 

Mr. Woershcing does not state what his level of 
Consciousness is . He attempts to use nothing but rationality, 
which would place him in the hated category of a ] or II. Yet he 
has apparently also joined the ranks of those who constantly

Two Nictories 

-Polomen Squeak By 
The ideal flow in any athletic event which a 

team strives for is to work as a uni t, set the 
pace of the game. and in essence, force the 
opposition to adopt a mode of play which is 
unnatural and uncomforta ble to them. A 
clearcut example out of the past are the UCLA 
Basketball teams, fa mous for playing " their" 
game. 

In their last two games. the Triton water polo 
team has come frustratingly close to finding 
" their" pace. But, as the thousands of you who 
watched in person and on closed circuit TV, 
such a complete gam domination has so far 
eluded the Tritons. 

Saturday's game against Occidenta l started 
happily. Excellence permeated the natatorium. 
the highlite being the presence of Shade's and 
O'Connell 's mothers. Under such pressure 
Shade responded by playing his cleanest game. 
including the abs !entation from profane words 
and gestures at the ref. Johnny 0 responded 
with a crowd pleasing backhand, which he must 
have talked the Oxy player into letting him take 
in order to impress mom. 

In the second quarter Oxy got foxy and 
started to swim . It was here that the loca ls 
totally lost " their" pace and "their" control. So 
much so that in the early moments of the 3rd 
quarCer, UCSD was on the undesirable end of a 
5-3 score. At this point goalie Rick Parmer en 
route to making 9 saves, evidently convinced 
the rest of the team that defense consists of 
slightly more than sitting by and yelling 
encouragement to the goalie. The Tritons 
managed to regain enough control to pull out a 
9-6 victory, send coach Fred Becker home 
shaking his head (but with a smile ) and insure 
steak dinners as rewards for O'Connell and 
Shade, 

When things seem to be nearing perfection in 
teamwork, the same thing seems to happen to 
the Tritons as happened to the girl who backed 
into the fan - disaster. So it was with Pomona . 

in a game decidedly a imed a t testing the 
integrity of the coach 's gastric system. Since 
Pomona was thought to be a simple team, the 
game plan was simple - blow them out at the 
start. then methodically shoot for 100 points. 

Unfortunately. certain circumstances arose 
which tended to cramp the local 's style. As you 
may know this was the first played by' 
moonlight this year at UCSD. This. in essence, 
took the place of the eye test of a physical , and 
it was both enlightening and disturbing to learn 
that even the guys on the team that don't wear 
glasses can't see much pasL their noses under 
artific ial light. Possible exception was Pixie 
Mike Norris, who was thoroughly elated at 
being able to stay up past his bedtime. 

Another interesting. but fortunately not as 
critical , fac tor. was the ball that dribbled more 
like on a basketball court than on water. Stoner 
n'oticed the flatness of the ball before the game. 
but since he only shoots shots that bounce , he 
thought better of inform ing the ref. 

After 2 quarters the score was 4-0 UCSD, not 
exactly half a hundred; after 3 periods, 6-1. 
UCSD. Then somehow the Tritons lost their 
pace, not to mention their defense and the score 
and the coach's stomach tightened . Once again, 
the local squad ended up with the bare minimal 
winning margi n, as the score jumped to an 
incredible 8-7 final. 

Looking at the stats it's hard to understand 
why the Tritons shooting percentage was only 30 
per cent: Stoner 1 for 1. Pickle 2 for 2, Turnquist 
1 for 2, Reimer 1 for 1, O'Connell I for 11. 
Ooops! But John had more pressure on him than 
even his mother's presence created. so no 
apologies necessary. 

The Tritons are now 7-2, on the season. wh ich 
exeeds any previous year 's output. After 
Chapman today (Friday ) at 4, and a busy 
weekend, that will hopefully swell on the 
winning side. Coming up : San Diego State, get 
your tickets early. 

Girlsloaf to Mesa loss 
Andy Estabrook 

The UCSD women ' s 
intercollegiate volleyball team. 
playing to an outstanding stay -
away crowd, lost to Mesa 
College of San Diego tast nite. 
by the scores 15-4. 8-15, 11-15. It 
appeared in the first game that 
the Triton girls had really 
come to play, a s th ey 
impressively outclassed the 
Mesa team with their hang -
loose atti tude and organized 
court play. centering on some 
nice sets by Ann Higgins and 
the booming spikes of Elaine 
Simay. 

The second game told a 
different story, however. as the 
Mesa felines clawed and 
scratched their way past the 
Triton six. who suddenly found 
the game of volleyball a ra ther 
boring affair and turned their 
attention to the more feminine 

traits of hair-fixing and clothes 
- straigthtening. Women 's 
intuition being what it is, the 

M~sa girls immediately sensed 
this mental collapse and 
managed to get the ball over 
the net enough times to claim a 
victory. 

The start of the third game 
saw the UCSD girls return to 
their formidable selves as they 
ran to a 7-2 lead, only to forget 
it takes IS points to win the 
game. and fell asleep again , 
snoring their way to an 8-7 
defici t. After a change of sides 
at this score, the Mesa kittens 
began to take advantage of the 
Triton blunders and came away 
with the game and the match, 
neither of which they played 
well enouih to deserve. 

play of Sally Krenn and 
excellent net work of Elame 
Simay. 

According to assitant coach 
Jeff Gorrell . this is the second 
year the girl 's team bas been in 
existence. but this year is the 
first year there has been 
enough organization to actually 
produce a competitive team. 
The team is in a girls' 
volleyball league and will play 
six regular season games 
before competi ng in a fi nal 
tournament to decide a league 
champion. 

PACIFIC 
HONDA-TRIUMPH 

Only mental errors and a 
lack of concentration kept the 
UCSD girls from blowing Mesa 
off the court in straight games. 
There are two bright spots 
that deserve mention, though, 
those being the fine overall 

Gorrell, obviously distraught 
over the evening's defeat. felt 
the girl ~ were "mentally down" 
and expects them to fare better 
against USIU next Thursday 
(7:30 in the gym), possibly 
going on to meet San Diego 
State for the championship in 
t he f'in a l t our name nt. 
Hopefully. the girls will stay 
loose. but put their heads (and 
hands) together when the fi nals 
roll around.

Cheshire, StoDer, O'CoDDel. aDd Reimer. Photo : Eastero 

The infallible computer increased its credibility last week by 
correctly predicting an upset (Miami over L.A.>' However, all 
bets are off on the tie <oakland and K.C.). But even with the 
tie, our record stands at 441. With another good week. our 
computer will become a definite contender for the 
"Predictor's Super BoWl." Now for this week 's games. 

GAME 1 - San Diego vs. New York Giants. John Hadl was 
working to the best of his capabilities last week against the 
Jets, and it looks as if he might have the same kind of fun with 
their Gotham rivals this weekend. If the Giants expect to win 
they 'll have to stop Had!. Unfortunately for the Chargers, 
though, if Hadl is stopped. mark up another loss for the 
hometown gridders. Nevertheless, the Computer picks the 
Chargers to come out on top by 3 points. 

GAME 2 - San Francisco vs. Minnesota - the Game of the 
Week. Both teams need to win this if they want to stay on top of 
their respective divisions. San Francisco's main strength lies 
in its air-gam , and Minnesota 's defensive capabilities are 
second to none. If the 49 'ers want a victory, they'll have to have 
a good day on the ground. But trying to run against the 
Norsemen is at least as difficult as trying to throw the ball over 
their heads. Minnesota should come out on top by 7 points. 

GAME 3 - Baltimore vs. L.A. - watch (are you ready ) for a 
nice wholesome All-American defensive struggle here. Both 
teams are so good that once they get moving offensively, 
they 're both quite difficult to stop. So the name of the game is 
STOP THE OTHER GUY. Most TD 's will probably fall into the 
category known in baseball as unearned runs. but when the 
final gun sounds, the Colts will be in the lead by 6.
