Someone at UDivenlty HaD .... come up wltb a wODderfal Idea: ship

wait %4 bcJunl to one week to let them. 

UCSD Ute)"8&ure professor A ... y Wrigbt-UCSD's represeDtative to the 
statewide c.NaJD1ttees studylag this Idea-bas caDed the proposal a 
"calamitous prospect." 

We agree. 
Wben sbadeDta 10 tbe Ubrary to research a topic, they doD't always 

DOW euctly wbat books they wi1I Deed. They Deed til lee the books, Dot I_ at the titleti aDd take a gueSl at the coateDL 
UCSD chemistry profeuor RUllleU DooUttle, ChairmaD of the UCSD 

Academic SeDate Ubrary COIIIIIlittee, says the prop.-al will save $1110-
mUlion Ia library costs. Wright cbaUeages thlll figure, saying it Is the 
product of "defective research!'We would like to add that any savings in 
costs would certaiDly be offset by the traDSportatioa costa for tht larle 
aamber 01 Ubrary books ordered by studeats everyday. 

Aad besides, did aoyoae ever say that the cost of a quality university 
educatioD would be small? There is DO way that UCSD can become a truly 
world-reDowned ualverslty without a hlgb quaUty library. 

The manner in which Unlvenlty Hall Is attempting to pusb this 
proposal through is also suspect. UCSD received notHication of the 
proposal only the week before last, and must seDd its recommendations 
on the plan back to Berkeley this week. 

It seems the UC Administration Is trying tbe same tactics it used with 
this summer's RegistratioD Fee raise: wait UDtII the students have gone 
bome for vacation or are mired in finals week to make a controversial 
and damaging proposal. 

We urge the administration stroDgly to reject tbis ridiculous proposal. 
Who knows? Mayhe uext someone will decide that aD the faculty should 

be placed in ODe central spot ...

NoPlng But Half the Truth 
I\1artian-Student Contact Foreseen 

b)'RoDAa .... 
OpIDioa EdItor 

A smalJ item which appeared in 
a local non-existent newspaper 
ca~ht my alt'!ntiOll yesterday. 
The article reported that scientists 
are specuiaUng that life on Mars is 
actually very inteUignet and that it 
has been covering up in the past 
two months so that the two Viking 
probes would get no hint of its 
existence. 

A certain scientist who ch(]6e to 
remain anonymous in this article 
claims that he has proof of the 
existence of intelligent life on Mars 
and that it wou~d only be matter of 
weeks before the rest of the people 
on Earth are informed. 

This prediction, if indeed it 
comes to be true, will have far-
reaching implications on our way 
of thinking. To begin with, we will 
have to surrt explaining ourselves 
to these foreign creatures. And I 
suspect that man will find that 
very hard to do. 

But the troubles win start when 
the Martians will try to explain 
themselves to us. Unlike students 
at Revelle, Martians cannot ex-
press 'themselves solely ·by the use 
of advanced mathematics. $Id let 
110 one suggest that the Martians be 
introduced to any of the other 
colleges as it is a well known ract 
that they only speak with the elite 
of new Civilizations. 

I expect, however, that the 
solution to this problem would soon 
be derived and a proper In-
tegration would be perfonned to 
solve it. Unfortunately, this would 
probably get us into deeper vector 
fields still. 

UO>D students, for example, wiD 
lie very eager to hear what kind of 
government the Martians employ 
as this university will soon select a 

Letters to the Editor 

new one of its own. The con-
versatioo might go like this: 
Martian: First of all, we have a 

';:'King. ( 
UCSD student: I suppose we can 
employ that here, although I'm not 
sure if the Chancellor would be 
above or beneath this position. 
Martian: Yes. Then we have the 
subjects. 
UO>D student: You mean you have 
no direct helpers to the Kq? That 
is indeed strange. But if it works 
for you we'd probably be willing to 
give it a try. Do the subjects pay 
taxes to the King? 
Martian: No. Each subject is 
responsible for · the welfare of his 
immediate neighbor. 
UO>D student: Who then is the 
King responsible for? 

Martian: HimseU. The King is the 
one who refuses to be responsible 
for anyone else. Isn't that sort of 
what you have for your leaders? 
UCSD student: I don'tthink so. But 
I'm not sure that this system would 
work for UOID. After all, with the 
competition for grades you can 

~rdly expect that we be kind to 
one another. 
Martian: Who expects? Just 
reward the low grade earners. 
What an obvious solution! Then 
everyone would help everyone else 
study, there would be quiet in the 
donna, and peer pressure would 
compel everyone to aUend cIaaIes. 
What a solution! What a miracle! 
What a hell! 

So that's what thoae Martians

Faculty "Majority" Condemned on Grant Issue 
In a recent letter to the Triton 

Times, Gabriel Jackson (Associate 
Dean of Graduate Studies) denied 
the importance of grant-getting 
ability in the promtltion of faculty 
members and lauded " an over-
whelming majority" of the faculty 
for their commitment to teaching. 

We disagree emphatically with his 
perceptions. 

• fTofessor Jackson's experiences 
in the History Department seem to 
have limited hfm to a liberal 's 
perception of ' the nature of the 
University. 

To be realistic, however, UCSD 

is a federally funded research 
institute. The large science ' 
departments which dominate this 
campus are dependent upon grants 
for survival. Consequently, 
education must be a secondary, if

Cancer: Moving Towards A ,Cure? 
In the last article I briefly 

discussed the three major types of 
cancer therapy, to wit, surgery 
radiation treatment, and 
chemotherapy, and suggested that 
the very limitations of these 
treatments presented what could 
be a significant advance in the 
treatment of cancer. 

Cancerous tissues typically have 
a highly restricted blood flow, in 
the region of 2-15 percent that of 
normal tissue. The reasons for this 
are twofold-blood supply is almost 
entirely capillary in nature, and 
the intercapillary distance tends to 
be greater. This becomes more 
true as the tumor grow older. 

Obviously, with a restricted 
blood flow, chemical agents In-
troduced into the blood stream 
have difficulty in aChieving suf-
ficientl y high concentrations 
within the tumor. If the con-
centration of the chemotherapeutic 
drug is raised to a level where the 
tumor is likely to be affected, the 
host tissues are more likely to 
suffer serious side effects men-
tioned in the previous article. As a 
corallary of this, oxygen con-
centration within tumors also 
tends to be quite low, since with 
less blood actually reaching the 
tumor, less oxygen is delivered. 

For somewhat different reasons, 
glucose concentrations within 
cancerous tissue is Quite low. 

Tumors metabolize ltlucose verv 
readily, since they lack inhibiting 
enzymes found in normal tissue. 
Glucose is in fact broken down by 
tumors faster than they are able to 

~tllize it, and much of the glucose 
IS converted to lactic acid . This is 

glucose level in the blood stream is 
raised, thus stimulathg the 
production of larger amounts of 
lactic acid on the part of the tumor 
while leaving normal tissu~ 
unaffected. This will selectively 
lower the ph of cancerous tissue.

Writings from a Finals' Week Veteran 
"And it came to pass that early 

in the morning of the last day of the 
semester there arose a multitude 
smiting their books and wailing. 
And there was much weeping ano 
gnashing of teeth, for they were 
sore altaid. For they had left un-
done things which they ought to 
have done. And there was no help 
for it." 

"And there were many abiding 
in the dorms who had kept watch 
over their books all night, but it 
naught avail them. And some there 
were who arose smilingly, for they 
had prepared fOT themselves the 
way, and made straight the path of 
knowledge. And those wise ones

not tertiary, priority for the 
overwhelming majority of the 
faculty. 

While it may be true that 
Jackson has never seen a fonnal 
rating of grantsmanship, we 
seriously doubt that he could find a 
single case in which a person with 
a large federal grant was denied a 
relatively small faculty, rates 5th 
in the country in the receipt of 
federal funds. Nor is it an accident 
that 1/3 of the entire UCSD budget 
is derived from federal grants for 
federal projects, while only 20 per 
cent comes from the state for 
undergraduate education. 

Lest Professor Jackson or other 
administrative spokesmen claim 
that this " proves" the quality of 
the faculty, it should be noted that 
POssession of a federal grant. or a 
PhD. for that maUer, is un-
correlated with teaching ability. 
Few, if any, of the U~D faculty 
ha ve received traning in the nature 
or methods of teaching. 

Par~doxically: few, if any, of them 
have the slightest doubt that they 
are excellent teachers. 

This has generated an arrogant 
contempt for the opinions of others 
particularly students. Why else b 
there no forum for open discussion 
between students and faculty about 
the education process? As 
professor Jackson's letter showed 
the perceptions of the vl~ 
(standards) and the perpetrators 
(faculty) of U~D "education" 
diiffer markedly. 

Professor Jackson's defense of 
facu lty practices is weak because 
this forum does not ex ist. But it is 
weaker still because of his own 

were known to some as the burners 
of the midnight oil. But by others 
they were called the curve-Iousers. 
And the mutitude arose and ate a 
hearty breakfast." 

" And they came unto their ap-
pointed place, and their hearts 
were heavy within them. And they 
came to pass, and some passed not, 
but only passed out. And some of 
t~~rn rpnPntPrl of their riotous 
hVlng!.. and bemoaned their fate, 
but they had not a prayer." 

"And at the last hour, there 
came among them one known 

"And at the last hour, there 
came among them one known as 

actions, shich belie his apparent 
concern for education. 

Last summer, Jackson tapped 
the Instructional Improvement 
fund for a one month $3000 salary 
to work on " Improving" the 
courses he teaches. This seems to 
be an unjustified use ofthe limited 
monies in this fund, considering 
theat " Improvement" is one of the 
nonnal duties of a professor, for 
which Professor Jackson had 
already been paid a rather 
adequate $27,000 salary. 

Where is the place where 
students and faculty can iron out 
such perceptual discrepancies in a 
neutral environment? A place 
where discussion can occur eithout 
students fearing grade reprisals 
and shattered careers as the 
penalty for frankness? 

the insturctor, he of the diabolical 
smile, and passed papers among 
them and went his way. A.nd 
many and varied were the answers 

which were given, for some of his 
teachings had fallen among fertile 
minds. Others had fallen fallow 
among the fellows, wnile still 
others had fallen flat. And among 
them some there were who wrote 
for an hour, others wrote for two, 
and some turned away sorrowful." 

. " And of these, many offered up a 
little sacrificial bull, in hopes of 
pacifying the instructor, for these 
were the ones who had not a 
prayer. And when they had 
finished, they gathered up their 

helon.llin~s and went away Quickly. 
each In his own direction. And eac h 
vowing to himself in his manner, I 
shall not pass this way again. But it 
is a long road that has no turn-
ing." 

This IS Just a lJtue someutu\l'; I 
picked up in my struggles at 
Cornell University, but I thought it 
is extremely apropos as a 
universal lament.

method is bacteriologically in-
duced fevers, while a third is the 
use of microwaves. The principle 
here is the same used in a 
microwave oven, except that in-
stead of cooking the entire body, 
the tumor site can be localized. The 
low blood flow of cancerous tissues 
is important in this connection 
since a lower blood flow mea~ 
that less heat is carried off by the 
blood. This allows tumors to be 
heated as much as 5-9 degrees 
above the levels of contigious 
tissue, despite the fact that the 
microwaves must pass through the 
surrounding tissue in order to 
reach the tumor. 

In regards to radiation treat-
ments, the low level of oxygen 
found within cancerous tissue is 
significant, since oxygen combines 
with free-radicals generated by 
irradiation, thus preventing their 
recombination (I.e. it interferes 
with the celluar repair processes). 
Radio sensitizers are available, 
and these, when introduced into the 
tumor, will perform much the 
same function that oxygen would if 
it were present. 

The last consideration here is 
perhaps the most important. All 
cells contain lysosomes, which are 
a package of enzymes capable of 
degrading every known component 

ot ~ cel~ , Including DNA. Foreign 
bodies In the hlood are literally 
consumed by the Iysosomes ot 
white corpuiles. The Iysosomes 

~re normally contained within an 
Intra-celluar membrane. If 
however, this intra-cellua; 
membrane can be weakened or 
broken, the cell will self-<lestruct 
and the lysosomal enzymes will b~ 
releaSed Into the extra celluar 
spaces. Lysosomes are activated 
by an acidic environment. 

In the next article we win take a 
look at the way these charac-
teristics interact therap"tically, 
and also take a look at some of the 
experimental evidence that 
demonstrates the efficacy of what 
has been called the " lysomal 
cytolytic chain reaction"· what we 
will be dealing with ~ an ex-
perimental method for causing a 
rapid release of the lysosomal 
enzymes, resulting in the death of 
the tumor.

[Editor'. note: For three year. Edward Simons entertained UCSD 
students with hi. Immensely popular "Low Blow. and Cheap 
Shots ... Now a writer lor the Senti n el. he returns lrom the dead lor 
another try.] 

Sitting here in front of a nice, wann, crackling television set, finals 
week seems almost invisibly far away. In fact, the more r think about it, 
the less real it seems. 

Fortunately for me, finals week is no longer a reality, if it ever was. I 
went to UCSD for four years and paid my debt to society. Four years at 
that atoll, and I have difficulty recalling a single finals week. 

No, finals week doesn 't really stimulate the old gray cells. What I 
remember most is that wcek before finals. Thoughts of that week crawl 
along my spine like centipedes wearing jackboots. That week was always 
the calm before the storm, the dark before the dawn, like waiting in those 
little anterooms for someone to leave a crowded bathroom so you can get 
~ . 

That week is like a thousand cliches all crammed into seven days of 
agony. Most of all, I just wanted that week to pass as quickly as the eight 
weeks before it. Somehow, I was always disappointed. 

But now it is you who are preparing to brave the maelstrom, some of 
you for the first time. And as I sit here drinking a jelly jar full of some of 
the worst hootch distilled this side of the Mason-Dixon line, I find myself 
confronting your horrid reality with an ocean of .indifference. 

Mter a thorough search into every corner of my soul, I've discovered 
that I just couldn't care less. It's too bad you have to take exams, but 
then, there it is. I doubt many of you forced to enroll at gunpoint. It's 
more likely you were thinking about ways to extort the registrar before 
the letter of acceptance-that baptism by paper-reached your home. 

Now, you might think yourselves part of the 10 per cent, a phrase I'm 
sure you've heard from someone-probably from some administrator 
who's in debt up t.o his throat and who needs your money to maintain a 
positive cash Bow. A real heart rending thought, isn't it? Thatone Qf your 
professors or deans or administrators may have to take out a second 
mortgage on his $70,000 La Jolla or Del Mar cottage to keep the finance 
company from repossessing his Porsche so he can arrive on time to give 
you lectures about capital redistribution? 

It breaks my heart, but back to you. What do you do as your teachers 
gibber and jabber and scratch their armpits and yawn in your faces? Sit 
there? 

I thought so. You' re all alike. There you are among some of the world's 
best learning resources, and you're in class listening to your professors. 

Ah, what the hell . I made the same mistake. 
This Safeway swill is beginning to get a stranglehold on my brainstem. 

It reminds me of a certain concoction we used to drink J>y the river before 
they put in the housing project. It was called several names, some of 
them unrepeatable. Rabid Hummingbird was one of them, I remember. 
Others were Rota-Rooter , Plague of Locusts and, if memory serves me 
right, Sylvia's Revenge. 

What made this drink so good to the survivors was the strange reeling 
effect it had. The drink was made up of equal parts of Scotch, Dr. Pepper 
and Clorox. The problem with this drink, though it was one hell of a pick-
me-up, was the startling effect on the bowels. 

Sylvia's Revenge? Sylvia was a girl most of us knew at one time or

another throughout school. I'll always have a warm place in my heart, if 
nowhere else, for dear old Sylvia. Sylvia-the extracurricular girl. 

Ah, the good 01 ' days! I'm rambling, aren't I? I don't care. I'm not 
getting paid for this. 

1 remember that grand old tradition of depOSiting the luckless birthday 
boy or girl in the Revelle fountain. Bob and I used to have a room in Argo 
overlooking the plaza. I can almost hear those pitiful, pathetic cries from 
the offenders as they were carried to the fountain for having the poor 
taste to celebrate another birthday on campus. 

What fun we used to have on Argo Six! How we shrieked in amusement 
as a water filled balloon enveloped someone's head and burst! 

In particular, I remember Halloween, 1973. Argo that night looked like 
Niagra Falls. What a sight. At the end of hostilities, the bottom of the well 
looked like a proving ground for tropical-colored prophylactics. 

The authorities moved in after that. Someone threw a waterhag of 
rather immodest proportions and succeeded in breaking a window. 
Behind this window was a student watching the fight. Her eye was cut and 
thereafter the resident dean, Rick Bayer, began to take the hard line on 
water fights . 

I'm pretty sure '73 was the year someone blew up the Coke machine, 
too. There used to be one by the elevator at the bottom of Argo. I 
remember hearing the explosion, then hearing someone scream, 
"They've nuked the Coke machine!" They didn't, of course. It was done 
with gasoline. . 

The fire alarm went off and everyone gathered on the balconies to 
watch the Coke machine's death throes. I think the fire lent a rather 
festive air to the general squalor of Argo Hall. 

Then there were the tunnels. They still exist, of course, but now they 
' are locked up very welL In our time ('72-'73) , it was but the work of a 
moment to violate the sanctity of these hallowed halls of conduit. 

It was, perhaps, indiscrete of us to do so, but Bob, Chris and I once led a 
tour through the tWlIlels. This was the opening of the floodgates. After a 
time, it got so you could meet old friends in the tunnels while you were 
trying to expla in the Mysteries to an initiate. 

Like of explorers of old, we had our Northwest Passage. We were 
always trying to find the connection between Muir and Revelle. We never 
did, though I think one now exists. 

Any takers? 
Ah, the age of exploration is just about gone. The office in which I work 

is devoid totally of the pioneer spirit. The stairway to heaven is in a 
serious state of disrepair. It's much too long at any rate . 

If, in your years at UCSD, your schooling seems more like a search for 
the holy grail, be grateful. If a degree were the only reason for going to 
college, it wouldn~t be worth it.

And I pondered the spirit of Christmas, the ideal of giving, the laughter, 
the men in red and their " ho ho ho's," the gifts in colored packages, the 
good cheer of those aU around. .. 

And I sa w that this was a time to be ha ppy, a period to think of others 
first , a season when we are supposed to remember ideals unsurpassed in 
history. A time for soul searching, . . 

And from my vantage point, higher even than the Humamtles and 
Social Science Building, I looked upon the UCSD campus, and saw none of 
this spirit. Done of the happiness, nobody reflecting upon his ~fe. , . 

For locked in their rooms were the students. self-contained In their 
stifling units, unable to interact, to live. They who had become one with 
books and equations, they who mwnbled now instead of talked; could not 
be classified among the living-no, they were the moving zombies of day 
and night, pwnping themselves 'with information easier to forget than 
remember, information they would rather forget than remember. 

And so J asked myself what J could do to appease this anguish, to soothe 
the situation, to make Christmas truly Christmas. And I came upon a 
solution that would at least give partial relief: peace to all in this season. 

And so this is what I'm doing. .

I've beard from women sucb pitiful 
excuses as, "Men should be turned-
off by a women who asked them out 
on a date". Bullshit. I don't know 
any guys who would be "turned-
off" by a forward girl. I have been 
asked out on dates by two girls and 
both times I was terribly flattered 
that the girls overcame their 
inhibitions. And we bad a great 
time, too. Whether women know It 
or not, men have feelings too. They 
like to know that they are needed, 
that someone enjoys going out with 
them. I've seen lots of girls ask 
guys to dance, so why don' t they 
ask guys out? One last thought: 11 
a guy would turn down a girl wbo 
asked him out, he's probably a sch-
muck anyway. This is the twen-
tieth century, girls. It's time to 
wakeup. 

bere 10 North County. FInally, 
some girls wbo are open enough to 
express their feelings about the 
male-female situations at UCSD. 
We feel It's time to donate our 
bodies, and minds, to a sellior 
research project 10 an effort to

he bad .. tall skJnny.aooktng USC 
biology professor wIto pve Ids 
name as Dr. Paul Saltman. Is tlds 
the same Saltman who presently 
lives in lafamy here at UCSD? 

You bet your life! Saltman, who 
is well known on this campus for 
his excellent taste in secretaries, 
appeared on the show during the 
1957-58 season. Although he doesn't 
remember the name of his fellow 
contestant, the two questions he 
missed remain firm in his mind. 
Whe asked how many stomachs a 
cow has, this emmlnent -biology 
professor answered that a cow has 
three stomachs. The correct an-
swer is that a cow has one 
stomach, divided into four parts. 
When asked where linseed oil 
comes from, our quick thinking 
Vice-chancellor of Academic 
Affairs answered that it comes 
from lin seeds, where else? It 
actually comes from flax. He did 

get his name right, though. 
Dear Doc: What Is tile parpole

In respOi se to our request that 

readers se Id us their opinions of 
women ask ing men out on dates we 
have the fo J~ing-

Doc: It sure sounds to me that 
these " four attractive and cbar-
mlng [female ] seniors" are ex-
pecting to be banded husbands 
with their B.A. degrees. ( wouid 
IIR to know wby these four women 
wOB't go out and flDd four at-
tractive and charming men. Why II 
It that the male tradltloaally has to 
ask the female out on a date? Why 
is It that the male muat always be 
the one who must risk rejection? 

Signed A Male for Women's Lib 
Dear Doc: It Is my opinion that if a 
woman finds a male attractive and 
Interesting that she should feel no 
hesitancy in asking him out. 
Whether women's lib ever ocurred 
or not, there are many people I 
know who have asked guys out on 
many occasions. Women's Lib bas 
given mUll} women the courage 
they never thought they possessed, 
however It Is more of an excuse 
than reason for this new found 
power . If a guy feels his 
mascu1talty is being questioned, he 
has the right to say "NO." There 
are some sby males on this camp. 
and some would be deltgbted to be 
asked out GO • date by some at. 
tractive female. By tbe way, "How 
about Friday nlgbt"? 

Dear Doc: In response to the 
letter from the four attractive 
females--Hey-where bave you 
been all oar lives! It's 1000ely up 

Dear Doc: The reluctance of 
men to ask women out on dates is 
an indicator that women are ready 
to have women ask them out on 
dates. Wbat's stopping the women 
from doing so? 

Well, there you have it. UCSD 
seems to be following the national 
trend of changing sex roles. The 
past existence of a double standard 
whereby men are supposed to ask 
women out but women are not 
supposed to ask men out, appears 
to have ended. Woman can, if they 
wantto, but men don't have to. 

Dear Doc: Recently, while 
watchlmt re-runs of Groucho Marx.

We found your strings, and have 
been told by certain" hunters" that 
they serve the same purpose as

inane questions. They also hold the 
bark up. 

Dear Doc: What II tile average

Before answering your question,

Art and Am °bians 
Student, Turtles Find Happiness A weekly newspaper that 

addresses the issues of the day? by Sara J . Lowen Associate News Editor 
" Once upon a time there was a 

man who loved turtles. He was 
obsessed with turtles and made a 
fetish of turtles. He loved the turtle 
image ... " (Peter Phillips, It's so 
Nice to Have a Pet Around the 
House) . 

Peter Phillips says he has loved 
turtles all his life. But it w: 'i:n' t 
until two years ago that Phillips, a 
Visual Arts graduate stud '!nt, 
decided to make turtles the focus of 
his artistic endeavors. He had been 
doing artwork with refrigerators 
and keeping turtles on the side, 
when he realized that the turtles 
were more interesting to him than 
his art projects . 

As he became more and more 
involved in the turtle world, 
Phillips realized that they were a 
rich source of material for art-
work. "The turtle world is a 
metaphor for human life ; the turtle 
world is a paradigm for the human 
world." Phillips said that as he 
became more involved with the 
lives of his turtles, he began to see 
that they contained many of the 
same dramatic and tragic 
elements of human life . 

Phillips illustrates this 
statement with the story of Buck, 
Daisy and Randy, three of his 
turtles who lived together as a 
family. Daisy got loose one day and 
Buck started pining away for her, 
refusing to eat or hibernate. Daisy 
returned several weeks later, and 
Buck perked up considerably. But 
their happiness was short lived. 
Seve ral weeks after Daisy 's 
return, Buck died of a kidney in-
fection. After Buck's death, Daisy 
and Randy contracted respiratory 
infections ; both eventually died of 
pneumonia . Phillips recorded the 
tragedy in a song entitled 'The 
Desert Tortoise Blues. ' 

Songs about turtles are the main 
form of Phillips' work. He has 
composed 20 pop songs about his 
turtles in a variety of musical 
styles: rock , blues, country and 
western, polka and latin. The titles 
of his notable works are : "I'm a 
Hotshot Turtle" and "You Ain't 

othin' but a Softshell." 
Phillips decided to use pop music 

as the main medium for his turtle 
works beca use it lends itself to 
telling storjes about the turtles and 
depicting their characters better 
than other media. He also does 
turtle portraits, photographs, 
stories and films. He eventually 
hopes to present a show of his 
turtle works in a gallery. 

Phillips believes that his turtle 

works constitute a serious art 
f?~. "A~ is finding meanings, 
fmding things out, exploration. I 
find meanings in the turtle world." 
He admits that people often don 't 
take his work seriously " because 
it's playful and comic on the 
surface." But underneath the 

Peter Phillips 

comic veneer of his work lies a 
serious view of turtles. " I think 
people see that I really care about 
turtles," he said. They know that 
I'm not faking it, that I'm really 
into turtles." 

But Phillips' involvement with 
his turtles.is more than an artistic

one. "I'm not just an observer," he 
says, "The turtles make demands 
on me. r must provide a good en-
vironment for the turtles, improve 
their living quarters , protect them 
from other animals, keep them 
healthy, feed them_ , 

In a sense, he feels that the turtle 
world provides an 'adjustment' for 
him, a way of finding meaning in 
the world. " The world is full of 
madness and absurdity. The world 
isn't explained. So people try to 
make sense out of life." Other 
people may find meaning in their 
work, their kids, their hobby in the 
same way that Phillips finds 
meaning in his turtle world.

steps back and realizes that " these 
are turtles" that he is so involved 
with. But it doesn't s top him from 
being involved with turtles because 
they fascinate him.

What will this turtle mania add 
up to? Phillips hopes that if he 
shows his work in a gallery, it will 
lead to a university professorship. 
" But r don't know what will 
happen to my work , maybe it will 
collapse, maybe it's just silly ... but 
it makes me happy. "

The Next Man: Middle East War 
Made Beautifully Idealistic 

by Recd Alpert 
Staff Writer 

The Next Man is a neatly done 
political thriller that keeps 
audiences off-balance more by 
giving the impression that 
something's about to happen than 
by having something happen. 

There are promises of huge 
international resolutions, of 
governments going to appalling 
extremes to protect themselves, 
even a glimpse of real peace 
between the Arabs and Israelis. 
However, the film chooses to let us 
hang with only a certain amount of 
resolution. 

Sean Connery plays a Saudi 
Arabian general turned United 
Nations delegate after the 
assassination of his predecesor and 
two other high ranking Saudi of-
ficials by an unknown group. The 
assassination was due to the Saudi 
orginated oil consortium that 
threatens both U.S. and U.S.S.R. 
interests in the Mid-East. Cornelia 
Sharpe is a beautiful, high-
cheeked, cold-blooded, assassin 
who is sent to get close to Connery 
and wait for the word to strike. 

Connery arrives at the U.N. 
General Assembly and delivers an 
unprecedented, world-shaking and 
beautifully idealistic speech 
calling for peace with Israel and a 
coordinated world effort to end 
famine and war. The speech is not 
surprising in itself, but Connery 
seems to mea;1 it and he even talks 
of the Saudis withdrawing from 
OPEC if needed. 

This provides him with a 
multitude of enemies and the plot 
with a number of ways to go. 
Sharpe, w~ demonstrates her 
nature coeUr assassinating one 
of the Sa udi officials, arouses 
Connery's interest at a cocktail 
party and t.le roman ce is on.

opening scenes secret meetings of 
powerful people (ostensibly th e 
CIA and KGB ) saying they'll take 
"appropriate" action against the 
oil consortium. Sharpe works for 
one of them, or maybe even the 
U.S. oil companies acting on their 
own, but it is never revealed to us 
just for whom she works. An at-
tempt is made to portray the movie 
reality as similar to the world of 
politics we all know. 

With Sharpe having easy access 
to Connery the other plots to kill 
him become just an excuse for 
violent action and the question is: 
will she fall for him or will she 

Record Reviews 

retain her iceberg quality? 
Connery's performance nicely 

shows a man who badly wants to 
end the pain and death of terrorism 
.and war, yet has to contend with 
those tnat *ould kill him; he must 
sadly hear of the violence that his 
own speech in the U.N. caused. 
Sharpe is adequate as a freon-
blooded.assassin; she has few lines 
and few chances to reach the 
depths she has shown herself 
capable of. 

Charles Cioffi as Connery's 
sidekick, Faoud, was superb; the 
perfect aide who tends to 
everything . Everything. 

Be Bop Deluxe Innovat~ve; 
Deep Purple Disappointing 

by Tim Mackenzie 
Arts Editor 

Modern Music-Be Bop Deluxe-
Harvest Records 

A classic example of innovative 
seventies rock can by found with 
this British band's latest LP, 
Modern Music. Paced by 
songwriter-guitarist Bill Nelson, 
Be Bop Deluxe continues to 
produce quality material with 
remarkable consistency. 

As Nelson says, "Change is an 
impOrtant part of this band. We've 
go to keep ahead of the trends." 

That they do, with this fine 
follow-up to last year's Sunburst 
Finish LP. As expected, Nelson's 
guitar playing and his exceptional 
vocal abilities provide the nucleus 
for Modem Music. Bassist Charles 
Tumahai , drummer Simon Fox 
and keyboardist Andrew Clarke 
give excellent support for Nelson. 

Made In Europe - Deep Purple -

Warner Brotners Records 
This disappointing live LP is 

culled from some Deep Purple 
concerts at _the Paris Olympia_ 

Theatre in early 1975. and 
represents Ritchie Blackmore'S 
final contributions to the band. 

Obviously conceived in the 
image of DP's immensely suc-
cessful Made In Japan LP, Europe 
is not nearly as acceptable, nor will 
it be as popular. The material on 
the album comes from a period 
when the band had already passed 

its peak, both artistically and in 
popularity. The selections include 
" Burn," " You Fool No One," and 
"Stormbringer. " 

Remarkably unimpressive is the 
quality of the recording, not to 
mention Blackmore's unbelievably 
self-indulgent solos. But Deep 
Purple is no more , in any·shape or 
form. Rest in peace, guys. I know I 
will .

A Voyage Through Faery Land 
Tennis • Raquetball • Badminton · Squash 

by Alan RUBseD 
News Editor 

It was with great regret that I 
left Middle Earth on a late 
evening. For three hours I had 
journeyed on perilous paths 
similar to the ones that Aragorn, 
Bilbo, Frodo and Gandalf-the 
great characeters from J.R.R. 
Tolkien's imagination--had 
traversed. 

In short, I was high and weD on 
the way to becoming hooked on the 
game, the experience, of Dungeons 
and Dragons. 

Now, how had it aU started ... ? 
He opened the door to the ReveDe 

suite. From behind a pair of 
bifocals dark eyes peered at me. 
"Good evening," he said. 

" Ah, a nazgul!" he exclaims 
excitedly. He looks at me behind 
the thick glasses. "Db, yes, I can 
manipulate anything!" 

Everyone at the table nods. 
" Part of being a Dungeon Master 

is being brilliant," he says. "You 
might encounter vampires, 
barrowwights, ringwraithes , 
scorpions, centipedes, warlocks, 
and only I know what other evils. 
Oh, and yes, most definitely 
nazguls? . " 

His words convince me of the 
necessity to buy weapons. With my 
hard diced gold I have to choose 
from about a hundred items in-
cluding daggers. swords, maces, 
bows, mules, armor, shields, 
spears, silver crosses and holy 
water. 

lAu~ Joe. QI'"I 
'hi J f.)i zo.~ .. . 

And this was just the beginning. 
He is the Dungeon Master. I 

should have known. It is rumored 
that in the daylight hours he's a 
UCSD sfudent named Matt 
Whalley. 
In a matter of minutes ·six players 
magica lly appear around a table. 
The moon is full, but the 
night is dark. The setting is per-
fect. Someone tells me that they 
are planning to paint the suite with 
black dungeons and fiery dragons. 
Even more perfe<;t. 

I look about the table and I see all 
sorts of dice laying about. Here and 
there, in between the Dungeon 
Master's myriad of books entitled 
" Men and Magic", "Monsters and 
Treasure", "The Wilderness and 
Underworld Adventures" are dice 
big and smaD, in shapes of cubes 
and triangles, the colors of 
jellybeans-one die, two dice, green 
dice, blue dice (and pink, yellow, 
red, and white) . Coklrs that would 
make a peacock jealous. 

I am asked whether I want to be 
a man, a dwarf, a hobbit, an elf. or 
a sorcerer. I choose the man 
category, in honor of my hero 
Aragom. 

Then the dice rol11ng begins, and 
I know how Rip Van Winkle felt 
bowling with the funny little men. I 
am told that my rolls wiD deter-
mine my "level." It is good to get a 
high level. I also am told that my 
status in life, the amount of money 
I have, my strength, my in-
telligence, wisdom, constiution, 
dexterity and charisma will be 
determined by the rolls. I score 
weD on everthing but wisdom, but 
I'm only a fairly weD off c0m-
moner (as ooDOted to a lord or 
merchant etc.) who has the 
vocation of fisherman. I hate fish. 
I ask the Dungeon Muter ·about 

the game. "How many people play 
it? How long has It been around?" 

He appears disinterested, 
snorting at the word "game," not 
looking at me. "Several hundred at 
Ua;o play it," he says. "It'. been 
around bout five years." 

I question him about what evils 
lurk in the dungeons. "Are there 
nazi.u1a?" I uk. 

a 

Before the games begin I have to 
stipulate whether I'm lawful, 
llCutral, or chaotic. I pick neutral. 
which means I'm basically a good 
guy, but can be devious here and 
there. 

Everyone purchases their 
provisions, and the game begins. 
Finally. 

It is then that things begin to get 
really hairy. 

Graph paper is produced, and 
the mapping of our dungeon 
begins. The Dungeon Master starts 
to throw the dice ("gonna roll them 
bones") faster than a Las Vegas 
craps table addict. We begin to 
move through a maze of dungeons. 

Then we meet magic users. 
And Cenmipedes. We get ex-
perience points for killing the 
centipedes. Our sorcerr seduces 
the magic users. 

We keep on trucking. Finally we 
get caught in a trpa room. The 
ceinling is moving down on us. Our 
strong dwarf and one of the 
fighters (Marcus and Theodore) 
get shot by orc archers outside. 

They die. 
Inside we await death, but then 

10 and behold, it is a falso trap to 
get those who escape the room. The 
three of us who are left alive ap-
proach a two an a half foot white 
chest, which we split open and find 
immeasurable wealth. 

Things keep happening. I'm still 
alive and wealthy, increasingly so. 
Finally I have to leave so I can 
make it to my night watchman job. 

The Dungeon Master looks at 
me. "You're leaving?" he asks 
incredulously. " It's not even 
midnight." 

" I've got to work," I explain . 
He snorts. It's true , dammit. 
I walk towards the door, and 

reality begins to close in on me. I 
pause a moment under the door-
way and look about the room. a 
larger group is now sitting at the 
table, staring at the Dungeon 
Master and his rolling dice. Those 
who I have seen die are now back 
in the gamE:, with new names and 
identities. Others have joined the 
game during the course of the 
evening. 

I wish I could stay. 
As I leave, someone shouts, "I 

hope a nazgul gets you. " 
I shiver while walking through 

the shadows. The night is cold.

The fall intramural season is over. I think . Due to an early deadline 

most all championship games will go unreported . All championship 
games, save two , hadn 't been played as of press time , so it would be 
foolish for me to speculate on the out come of the games. 

The two championships that have been decided are in the "C" and " B" 
divisions of 3-iln-3 Basketball. The BOUNCERS took the " C" cham-
pionship, while the MICKS captured the "B" title . 

Football 
Looking back on the intramural football season this reporter has a few 

observations to make on the teams, the play and the players. 
For the most part it appeared that everyone had a pretty good time, 

excep,t of course, the time that you got someone else's elbow in your nose, 
or th time your team was called for a penalty that caned back a touch-
down that would have won the game. But at least it se~med like eveyone 
was having fun . After the game, if not during. The. beer always helps 
sooth a loss. And it even makes a victory feel better. 

For some of you that played, the Everyone 's Eligible staff would like to 
bestow some timely, if uncalled for awa rds . 

Most Valuable Team-Charlie Johnson 
Best Looking Team-LAGNA F (not you, P etherbridge) 
Most Improved Team-T.C. (after going scoreless in their first four 

games, they managed a touchdown in their fin al effort. ) ,

I had to do some digging, but I did manage to come up with a few 

awards for the Innertube Water Polo players as well.

women's volleyball team to the 
SWlAC conference and postseason 
tourney titles. 

Beylen, a junior and a regular 
for the past three years, was the 
team's nwnber one hitter. Active 
in all sports, Bey len plans on 
transferring to UC Davis next year 
to pw-sue a degree In physical 
education. 

"This was by far the best team 
we've had since I've been at UC-
SO," she said wilen given 'her 
award. 

Horimoto, oolya sophomore, has 
.been called by volleyball coach, 
Ch\ICk Millenbah. "One of the 
finest players ever at UCSD," she 
has ea[Jled an AA rating in 
amateur volleyball competition, 
the highest ranking In women's 
volleyball. 

"This award," said Horimoto, 
"came as a complete surprise. 
Women don't usually win these 
kinds of 'awards even though they 
often deserve them. Or they're just 
given a 'woman athlete of the 
month award,' as if what they do 
isn't as good as the men." 

Both Beylen and Horimoto ex-
pressed some dissatisfaction with 
the level of competition the Tritons 
faced this year. "It's tough to get 
up for a game when you know that 

Corky Hu" [IT ph oto : C hris 
Sh erman] 
all you have to win Is serve the 
ball," Horimoto said. 

Corky Hull started for four years 
on UCSD's waterpolo team, but it 
took him until this season to finally 
be a part of the victory over San 
Diego State. " It was our most 
important win of the year," said 
Hull, ranking it over the team's 
win in the Riverside Invitational. 
" Everyone contributed," he 
added. 

In his four years here, Hull has 
earned a 3.8 GPA while missing 
just one waterpolo practice. Last 
season he was captain of the team, 
but this year he felt it would be a 
better distribution of leadership 
roles not to take the position. Hull's 
fifty goals this year led the team in 

••• scoring. 
So much for this quarter. Winter Quarter promises to be just as lively. Typifying Hull's team attitude, 

With such sports as Basketball, Soccer, Hawaiian Football, Floor Hockey on receiving his award he said, 
and 1 Pitch Softball, no one should have any problem finding a sport that " I'm not sure if it shouldn't be Bob 
he or she would like to play. . A1ei sitting here."

Hey, wait a minute! What's

qualify for a national playoff 
competition ?

Is the winning-Is-important-but-

I mean, you figure that an 
athletic program that doesn't give 
scholarships, doesn't have enough 
money to pay coaches, and doesn't 
charge spectators to attend games 
because i&6 worried that no one will 
show up, well, you have to figure 
that this kind of operation is not 
going to produce too many 

" It says ' something about the 
desire of the athletes at UCSD," 
says athletic director Judy ,Sweet. 
"Without scholarships, without 
recruited athletes, without the 
benefits provided by bigger 
athletic programs, the athletes do 
it almost completely 011 their own. 
Coaches, are a part of It, too, but so 
much comes from the Individuals 
playing." 

But why so much success dIia 
year? 

"It's herd to attribute it to any 
one thing," says Sweet. 

Yeah, it's hard. Probably im-
possible. It would be reaching to 
use any one theory to explain the 
autwnn exploits of these teams. 

But there must be some con-
nection between a soccer team that 
qualified for the NAIA District III 
playoffs, a waterpolo team that 
won the Riverside Invitational, a 
badminton team that captured a 
league championship, and a 
volleyball team that won both its 
league and post-season tourney 
titles, all during the same quarter. 
Nothing like that has ever ha~ 
pened at UCSD before. And this is 
just a lowly, studies-before-sports 
school, remember? not a UCLA 

, or San Diego State. 

What's happening? 
Has UCSD suddenly turned into 

an intercollegiate athletic power? 

Is the scientific appraisal of 
reality so prevalent on this campus 
becoming more and more com-
patible with the growing 
technostructure in 1970's American 
sports?

studies; and soon, all of whom 
decided to be a part of a sport that 
they had always enjoyed? 

"Help me, Information, give me 
Memphis Tennessee! "-

I don't understand this athletic 
success. I just hope it doesn't go to 
anyone's head. Because it is more 
interesting than losing. 

Besides, it could easily all 
change when this nice weather 
\Ye've been having goes away.

Mortor, Sbaevitz, Director of 

Counseling and Psychological 
Affairs, says that "Finals week 
may be oln appropriate time (for 
studerts) to feel panicked. " To 
cope with the pressure, he urges 
students to use " available 
resources, friends, older students 
and graduate students, and then of 
course there's us." 

"We," the Counseling and 
Psychological Department, "see 
about 7J) percent of the student 
body each year," said Shaevitz. 

. "This is twice as many students as 
other comparable universities." 

Part fl the reason for the large 
turnout is due to the "staff building 
a reputation of competence 
through their high availability and 
expertise ... · However, Shaevi" 
noted that there "wasn't much of a 
response" to the extensive finals 
week program launched last year. 
Efforts this year will be cen-
tralized the Matthews Campus 
office. .

after they come in for an ap-
pointment. Shaevitz said most of 
the students who seek assistance 
during finals week are highly 
motivated and care a great deal 
about their grades. 

• • • 
For those students who have 

waited 10 weeks to begin studying, 
aod for those who are merelv 
gearing themselves for that last 
academic push, the Edna staff at 
the Student Center is hosting their 
quarterly "Burnout Center." 

The Burnout Center will be open 
24 hours each day of finals week 
and will provide donuts, coffee, 
and cokes for students trying to 
stay up aod study. 

In addition, counsellors ' from 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services will be on hand here aod 
at Page 1 to talk to students who 
are feeling overly depressed by the 
pressure of fioals week. 

Besides leaving the IOllBge open 
for food and studying, the North 
Conference room will open for 
students to sit back and watch 
movie horts. Included will be 
Chaplin, W.C. Fields, and nature 
shorts. The side lounges wiU be the 
site of on·going chess and checker 
games. 

For those students really 
desiring to vent their frustrations, 
Wedne ' day night there will be a 
knock·down-drag·out poker game. 
The Edna staff hope these ae-
tiviti s will help ease the pressures 
and depression that traditionally 
accompany finals week at UCSD.

He said the " usual thing" 
students experience is an over· 
whelming anxiety, especially in 
first year students, where the 
enormity of the new experience of 
college has "clogged up." 

Shaevitz explained that his 
department recognizes the 
students' problems and deals with 
them in a realistic fashion. He said, 
" the first step is to help students 
label what's going on, finding out if 
the student is not getting enough 

sleep or not eating. We also 
develop a plan of action, planned 
study and non-study times. The 
non-study times are very im· 
portant, for the student to get away 
from the grind for pizza or tennis. 
Additionally we deal with fears in a 
realistic fashion. If a student has 
gotten a couple of Os in math, he 
should realize that his hopes of 
making a good grade on his final 
may not be realistic." 

Sleep Deprivation 
The most important physical 

problem during finals week is 
"sleep depravation," said 
Shaevitz. " Added to already 
existing panic, when a student 
crams, his sleep decreases ... this 
only feeds into the panic, feeds in 
physiologically, and causes the 
student to get weird. A lack of deep 
sleep causes you to feel unreal" 
weirded out. You are unable to do ! 
things efficiently. You must build 
into your schedule a blow off tinie, 
a time to relax ... sleep time." 

Shaevitz also said he questions 
some studerts' majors. He said 
many people ch~se a field of study 
that they don't care for, are 
unhappy with, and are not doing 
well in. For these students he 
suggests Lifestyle Groups which 
the center runs, which may open a 
student up to a realistic major that 
will make him happy. 

Shaevitz said, " Those are 
legitimate feelings for students to 

~ve at this time. We help them 
find out what not doing well means. 
Okay you screwed up, so now what 
can be done to recover?" He also 
said that they many times refer a 
student to seek out OASIS at the 
beginning of the next Quarter. 
" Tutors often help with subiects." 

Shaevltz added. "There is one 
problem that is not talked about as

often. The end·fl finals, especially 
before Chrlstmas vacation, means 
a reconnection with parents. This 
I'eCOMection usually encounters 
mixed feelings. The idea of going 
home may ' carry negative 
feelings ... a fear of expectations 
and reactions." 

Services helps the student make a 
separation between the student's 
parent's expectations and his Own. 
Shaevitz said the most important 
aspect is to bring the student 
looking at his situation and 
problems, to realistic terms.
