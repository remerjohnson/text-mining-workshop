Beer Compan,y Repl senlatlves Will 
Appear on KSDT Early In Next Quarter 

will attend the forum. whicb 
will be beld Jan. 16. the second 
week of winter quarter. 

A meeting to begin or-
ganWng student participation 
in the program will be held 
tomorrow. 3 pm at the KSDT 
studios in the Student Center. 
Thornburg said all interested 
students are encouraged to 
attend. Coon ~tly IUbmitted a 

seriea of radio PfOlJ'ams to 
KSDT eatitled "Mystery AI My 
Hobby" that were originally 
aired in the ItMOs. Brad Thorn-
burg. KSDT's general mana-
ger. said the station will not run 
the programs if the charges are 
true aDd tbat the forum AI 
intended to determine tbe 
accuracy of the charges. 

Tbe allegations grew out of a 
two-year-old strike at the Coors 
plant in Golden. Colorado, 
wbere the union bas cbarged 
Coors with racial dilcrimina-
tion. 

"I objected to Coors' repu-
tation witb the media," said 
Tbornburg, "They ' ve been 
charged by various labor 
oriented groups with serious 
moral offenses in dealing with 
their employees . Coors has 
never defended themselves 
against these allegations. 

"These allegations produce 
an extremely poor media 
image of Coon wben they're 
not defended. ThAI bas made 
me as a citizen and as a general 
manager of a radio station 
wonder wby they have soch a 
curtain of silence concerning 
these issues," he said. 

If the forum indicates the 
charges are not true, the station 
will air the program, Thorn-
burg said. 

Joe Benites , Coors com-
munity relations manager and 

one of the representatives 
scheduled for the forum. said. 
"We want to respond to some of 
the questions that crop-up on 
the campuses." 

For years . said Benites. 
Coors has paid their repre-
sentatives to say " no com-
ment. " Coors now wishes to 
open up a dialogue with the 
public and this forum will do 
that, he said. 

Benites said that in addition 
to himself, Susan Booker, a 
Coors campus representative, 

Coors is providing the pro-
grams free to a number of 
campus stations, including 
USF, San Francisco State and 
Stanford. Each program con-
ta ins three " public service 
announcements," according to 
Barbara Lawrence , t he J .

handling tbe Coors account.

Berkeley Committee 
Finds Sproul 38 Guilty 

By Trapper 8yne 
........ &lleGur· • 

BerUley - Tblrty-e1lht UC 
Berkeley ltudentl arretted in a 
ut-iD Jut JUDe • PI'Ote8tinl uc 
investment in firms 'operating 
in South Africa were found 
guUty Monday of violating 
University regulations by the 
UC Berkeley Student Conduct 
Committee. 

The studentl, most of whom 
are members of Students For 
Economic and Racial Justice 
(SERJ). are being informed of 
the decision by mail tbiI week. 
Althou,b the students could be 
suspended or expelled, tbe 
Conduct Committee bas recom-
mended that the punisbment be 
no more severe than a repri-
mand. 

Chancellor Albert Bowker 
has the final sayan both the 
verdict and the punishment. 

The dilciplinary heariDls, 
the first held at Berkeley since 
1969, were originally scheduled 
to last only two days, Oct. 30 
and 31. Due to scbeduling 
conflicts witb Committee 

members, lawyers and de-
fendantl, however, the bear-
inga were beld intermitteDtly 
unW NOY.13. 

The delays were a source of 
concern to defense COUD8eAl 
Wayne Collins and Lute Ellis. 
They were particularly upset at 
tbe decision of Committee 
Chairman Henry Ramsey, a 
non-voting member. to post-
pone hearings on Nov. 9 and 10 
so tbat be could attend a 
conference in Ore,on. 

EllAl, wbo had informed the 
committee that he would be 
unable to defend the students 
after Nov. 13, requested that 
Ramsey appoint a substitute 
chairman, a request whicb 
Ramsey denied. In an effort to 
end the heariDls with EllAl 
present, the defense was then 
forced to call fewer witne88e8 
than it bad originally intended. 

Ellil told Ramsey that his 
•• arbitrary decision to cut these 
proceedings off" bad denied the 
students "due process under 
the law and under the rules of 
these bearings." 

Assembly Hearing 
AI UCSD Tomorrow, Friday 

The Assembly Ways and 
Means subcommittee on pOst-
secondary education, cbaired 
by Bay Area legislator John 
VasconcellOl, will hold bear-
ings on interdiscipl)nary 
studies programs in tHe Uni-
versity of CaUfornia tomorrow 
and Friday at UCSD. 

The committee will meet 
with a group of faculty repre-
sentativn Thursday ' afternoon 
from 1: OO-S: 00, and tbat 
eveniDl be bolted by Third 
Colle,e faculty, .taff and 
student.. Tbird College. In 
whicb many of the Interdia-
ciplinary pl"OlJ"amI Vucon-
cellos' committee II Itudying 
reside, has invited 2S .tudentl 
and over 2S faculty to attend the 

cUnner. 
Friday morning, three pro-

fessors who were not able to 
speak last spring at similar 
bearings in Santa Barbara will 
addreu the committee, and in 
the afternoon the committee 
will bear testimony from 
students on maintenance of 
interdisciplinary programs. 

AccordiDl to a Vasconcellos 
aide reached ye.terday, the 
all88lination Monday of San 
Francisco Mayor George 
Moscone almost caused can-
cellation of the .ubcommittee 
bearinp. 

Vasconcellos. a close friend 
of the late Mayor, considered 
staying in San Francisco for 
tomorrow's funeral. 

The bearings grew out of a 
protelt held in Sproul Hall, the 
Berkeley camput admuu.tr .. 
lion buUding, last June, in 
which 51 people, including 38 
current .tudents, were ar-
rested and cbar,ed with unlaw-
ful use of a pubUc building and 
violation of student conduct 
codes after they remained in 
the foyer of Sproul Hall past the 
closing time. 

A similar arrest ordered by 
the University in June 1976 
resulted in not-guilty verdicts 
in Berkeley courts for all 
arrested in another Sproul Hall 
sit-in. No dilcipUnary heariDls 
were convened in that case. 

The June 9 protest was staged 
the day after a special Regents' 
meeting beld on campus con-
cerning the issue of UC divest-
ment failed to produce a 
quorum. 

Carol Bremner, a member of 
SERJ and witness at tbe 
discipllnary hearings, com-
plained that the Regents in 
effect had "boycotted theirown 
meeting." . 
. Sbe added that the demon-
stration was an attempt by the 
students to make UC invest-
ments a public issue, claiming, 
"you can't make a public 
statement at Regents' meet-
ings when they won't allow you 
to .peak." SERJ had attempted 
unsucceufully a number of 
timn to speak before regular 
Regents' meetings. "You can't 
make a public statement wben 
the Regents won't even come 
and discuu the luue with you," 
said Bremmer. 

Bremmer also said that the 
studentl' purpose in sitting-in 
at Sproul Hall was to show 
•• after two yean of working on 
tbiI iuue (divestment) , we 
weren't JUit kidding around. 
They (the Regentl) .bowed 
ablolute disreaard, ablolute 
unaccountablUty to the people 
they are .uppoaecl to be rep-
resenting."

A deep lonciDI and ao aacient, 
recurreDt viaiOD of death He bebiDd the 
story of the People's Temple Cburch. 

To some who Joined it ill earHer 
daYI, it was the commUDity that the 
1 .. bad promiaed and tbeD failed to 
deliver: a clole bi, family tbat 
transcended both race and cia .. 
barriers and Hved ill celebration of 
God while worldn, to transform . 
aociety. 

Thil IdeaUstic alped of the cburcb 
drew not only people who were lost and 
confuaed but alao othen who found it 
spoke to a need that our society Ial'le~ 
iporea. It offered a cbance for a 
coherent life built around spiritual 
practice. 

But to understand what happened 
later, when deeradation and destruc-
tion took over, we must look to the 
past. The People'l Temple Cburch 
ltory II part of a dark and violent 
stream that bas coursed throup the 
West, sweepiDI out from dim recesses 
of the mind and acroll history in times 
that shared many qualities with the 
present. 

Since the Middle Ages, relilious 
leaders have repeatedly risen from 
the people to preach the coming of the 
end. They gathered around them a 
following that was willing to obey 
implicitly, die if asked, and await the 
ultimate confrontation between good 
and evil that would herald a millenium 
during which all would live peacefully 
as children of God. 

In Europe between the 11th and 16th 
century, the salvationist messiahs 
foresaw an imminent final struggle 
between Christ and Antichrist. 

Almost always they arose during 
times of rapid social change when 
many people were uprooted, family 
bonds were weakening and breaking, 
and " the gap between rich and poor 
was becoming a chasm," according to 
historian Norman Cohn. Their 
followers usually came from ur-
banized areas. 

"Then in each of these areas in tum 
a collective sense of impotence and 
anxiety and envy suddenly discharged 
itself In a frantic urge to smite the 
ungodly," Cohn wrote in his book, In 
Punult of the MllIenium. By so doing, 
believers hoped to bring into being, 
• ' out of suffering inflicted and 
suffering endured," the final King-
dom. 

menta iDcluded the Crusades and the 
Flagellants wbo heat tbemlelves 
bloody ill re1iJious fervor. All of them 
bid leaders who called for a renun-
ciation of the world, often for self-
denial and self-torture. UlUally these 
leaders aIao performed bealings, as 
did Jim Jones. 

These movementa led to the first 
pOlroms alainlt Jews and the 
slaqhter , of clefi)', MOldems and 
othera beHeved corrupt. They also led 
to tbe twentieth century totali-
tarianisms, Includinl Nazism in 
Germany. .' 

Jim Jones is linked to this dark 
current, thoup no precedent exista 
for bis people's mass suicide. 

But II was the coupling of the lonling 
for brotberhood and tbe sense of 
imminent doom that helps explain 
wby bis congrelation grew 10 
powerfully before ita preoccupation 
with death turned upon itself. 

In March, 1976 many Sao Fran-
ciscans learned of the temple for the 
fint time wben it came to the aid of 
Kamook Banks, the young wife of 
American Indian Movement leader 
Dennis Banks, who had been forced to 
have a. baby in prilOn because her 
friends could not raise the $20,000 bail. 
She was being beld for trial on a 
cbarge of possessing firearms , of 
whicb she was later found innocent. 

Jim Jones announced that his people 
had voted to put up the churcb 
educational fund, which was spon-
soring 100 members through various 
schools, as bail . Late one evening the 
congregation gathered tQ welcome the 
young mother, her husband who was 
himself a fugitive from a warrant in 
South Dakota, and their lCHiay old 
daughter. 

Tbe threesome stood in the pulpit 
and thanked the church. The con-
gregation responded with a rendering 
of "We shall overcome" as powerful 
as any since the day Martin Luther 
King gave his "I have a dream" 
speech on the steps of the Lincoill 
Memorial. 

Indeed, this congregation seemed to 
embody the civil rights movement of 
the 1960s. It was a mix of blacks and 
whites and included people who spoke 
street jargon and others who were

This student was one of tbe

about the formation of numerous

that the congregation exiated witbin a

PSA Crash Investigation 
Controllers Answe 
SAN DIEGO (AP) -Traffic 

controllers involved In the 
nation's wont air disaster 
insisted yesterday that proper 
steps were taken in decidinl 
not to relay a radar conflict 
alert to the pilot of the doomed 
Pacific Southwest Airlines 
plane. -

Testimony in the first two 
days of a national Transpor-
tation Safety Board hearing 
into the Sept. 25 crash in-
dicated that air traffic con-
trollers at the Federal A via-
tion Administration 's San 
Diego Approach Control 
believed the PSA pilot bad a 
smaller Cessna 172 in sight 
moments before the two 
planes collided. The colHsion 
killed 144 peraons. 

NTSB records showed that a 
alert warnin, in-

tbe two planes were 

dangerously close had 
sounded 17 seconds before the 
crash. 

But both Nelson E. Farwell 
and Abram N. Lehman, the 
Miramar controllers moni-
toring the two planes on 
radar, testified that tbey gave 
no warning to the PSA jet 
because they believed the 
"conflict had been resolVed." 

That was because Capt. 
James McFeron, the PSA 
pilot who died in the crash, 
told controllers he had "traf-
fic in sight" when he was 
advised the Cessna was ahead 
of him. 

Donald W. Ralpb, FAA 
team supervilOr at the Mira-
mar Radar Air Traffic Con-
trol Facility, testified his

White Charged in Dea-ths 
Death Penalty Possible, Workers Mourn 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -

Former San Francilco Super-
vilor Dan White was charged 
Tuelday with the murders of 
Mayor Geor,e Moscone and 
SupervilOr Harvey Milk ill a 

crimi~l complalnt which cites 
a law caIHnl for the death 
penalty . 

District Attorney Joseph 
Freitas, in a brief news con-
ference, revealed that the two-
count complaint had been filed 
in Municipal Court. 

He laid White would be 
arraigned today on the charges 
which cite "special circum-
stances" - a crime covered by 
the death penalty in California. 

Freitas charged that White 
killed Moscone and Milk "in 
retaliation for and to prevent 
the performance of the official 
duties" of the two officials. 

Moscone and Milk were killed 
Monday in City Hall. White 
surrendered to police about 45 
minutes after the lbootings. 

The diltrict attorney refused 
to answer questions and said he 
would make no further com-
ment on the case. 

"I feel very strongly that my 
office may not comment on this 
case in order that there be no 
violation of the rights of this 
defendant, " he said. 

In addition to the two counts 
of murder, White was charged 
with possessing and using a 
firearm, a .38 caliber revolver 
during the assassinations . ' 

Ruhr to 
Strike 

ESSEN, West Germany (AP) 
- For the first time in 50 years 
steelworkers in the industriai 
heartland of West Germany 
went on strike yesterday to 
press their demands for 5 
percent more pay and a 35-hour 
work week. 

Employers of the 37 000 
strikers countered with' the 
announcement that they intend 
to lock out 29,000 workers at 
eight other plants on Friday. A 
spokesman for the employers 
said he anticipated the move 
will cut the strike short. . 

Scores of Dowen and burned 
down candies - placed on the 
steps to City Hall by San 
Franciscans mourning tbe 
deaths of Mayor George MOl-
cone and SupervilOr Harvey 
Milk - met city workers 
yesterday. 

Some workers said their 
offices were operating nor-
mally but the hushed voices and 
IOmber (aces belied the mood 
on the day after the tragedy.

USE ENCARE OVAl: 
Encare Oval- was introduced to Ameri-
can doctors In November 1977. Almost 
immediately, it attracted widespread phy-
sician and patient attenlion. 
Today, Encare Oval is being used by 
hundreds of thousands of women, and 
users surveyed report overwhelming sat-
isfaction. Women using Encare Oval say 
they find it an answer to their problems 
with the pill, IUD's . diaphragms, and aero-

2solfoams. EFFECTIVENESS 
ES1MUSHED IN 
CUNICAL TESTS. 

Encare Oval~ was subjected to one of the 
most rigorous tests ever conducted for a 
vaginal contraceptive. Results were 
excellent-showing that Encare Oval 
provides consistent and exlremely high 
sperm-killing protection. This recent U.S. 
report supports earlier studies in Euro-
pean laboratories and clinics. 
Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
cise. premeasured dose of the potent, 
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol 9. Once 
properly inserted, Encare Oval melts and 
gently effervesces, dispersing the sperm-
killing agent within the vagina. 
The success of any contraceptive 
method depends on consistent and 
accurate use. Encare Oval" is so conve-
nient you won't t e tempted to forget it. 
And so simple to insert, it'si1ard to make 
a mislake. 
If pregnancy poses a special risk for you, 
your contraceptive method should be se-
lected after consultation with your doctor. 

3NO HORMONAL . 
SIDE EFFECTS. 

Encare Oval" is free of hormones. so it 
cannot create hormone-related health 
problems-like strokes and heart 
attacks-that have been linked 10 the pill. 
And, there is no hormonal disruption of 
yourmern.trual cycle. 
Most people find Encare 
Oval completely satisfac-
tory. In a limited number

You can buy Encare Oval whenever you

Women's Center Fights Abortion Suit 
By ~ IIIIffer

In response to a handful of 

.tudentl' letal action aplnat 
University-funded abortiona, 
the Womea'. Ceater la tallylq 
.upport for the current health 
iDlUranee pJ'Oll'8lll at UCSD 
whieb offen abortIona as one of 
Its IIWI7 beaefIta. 

The Cellter la reactinI to the 
efforts of az UC atudents who 
bave flied a formal complaint 
.,ainat the Univenity. The 
plaiNt". bave cbarled that 
their moral beliefs have beeD 
violated by the UDlvenity'. 
flDanciq of abortiona tbrouJb 
atudeat reglatratiOll fees. The 
cue la atIll penclin,lD court. 

"It la the reapoaalbillty of the 
scbool to fund abortiona," one 

member, Vandi Lin,strom, 
aaaerted. "Reatrictinl options 
is not IOmetbiDa .tudents want. 
University-funded abortiona II 
an option that needa to be open 
to women." 

Abortiona are one of many 
healtb-related procedurel 
curreatiy covered by ltudent 
health insurance. Eacb year 
the Univenity mUll renew a 
health 'lnaurance proJl'am for 
.todents, aeeldq a plan which 
beat coven students at the least 
pouible COlt. The lnaurance is 
financed tbrou,b .tudentl' 
reaJ,atration fees. 

Few optiOlll are available 
withlD the inaurance prolJ'8Dl, 
as the University must accept 
the terms of the COdlpany it 
choole •. Becau.e of this, 

Unptrom .. id, "studentl are 
not payinl for abortions -
they're payin, for lnaurance. It 
(the insurance) pay. for a lot of 
tbInp I don't care for. but that 
doesn't mean that it shouldn't 
be covered." . 

Marlene Lerner, anotber 
member of the Women'. Cen-
ter, added that students "are 
not dlrectIy payiDi for any-
tbiq." 

Many members of the Center 
feel that the proteatlnl students 
are avoldial the real issue. 
"Because they are motivated 
by tbe Ri'ht-to-Llfe move-
ment," Lin,.trom said, 
"they're trylna to eliminate 
abortion wherever they can 
and ... hide the Issue. They are 
not 10 mucb concerned with 

Itudents' money as with their 
relilious principles." 

Other members discuaae. the 
dlatributions of Itudent bealth 
in.urance money . Sharon 
Bau!DIarten noted, "If we sat 
and broke down everything 
objectionable to everyone, 
notbinl would be left. Student 
health 1000 for the best plan 
possible. Abortion bappena to 
be one aspect covered."

UCSD I$n't Only a Classroom 
By Jolla Brock 

When .tudent. bave an 
interest In .tueties that reach 
beyond tbe regular UCSD 
curriculum, what can they do? 
Frequently, taking a "Special 
Studies" course is the answer. 

"Eacb .department at UCSD 
offers 199 (individual study), 
198 (IrouP.tudy), and 197 (field 
study) courses every quarter," 
said Nancy Gross of the Revelle 
Provost's Ortice. "However, an 
interested, qualified student 
should cboose a topic and find a 
professor a full quarter before-
hand." 

,. A Special Studies course is a 
superb way to do advanced 
work and really get to know one 
professor well," said Ed 
Lazarus, a Revelle junior. 

Lazarus and fellow student Del 
Powell are workin, on a 
Political Science 191 course 
with Dr. Sam Kernell. " We're 
dolnl a computerized statis-
tical .tudy of the evolution of 
the political career ladder to a 
governorship." Lazarus con-
tinued. "We bypothesize that 
this ladder emerged about the 
same time as a lot of corporate 
trusts, unions, associations like 
the AMA, and .the modern 
Congress; that is , around 
1910." 

"I'm looking forward to the 
biggest reward In our studies to 
come in tbe next few weeks. 
That's when we ' ll get tbe 
statistically organized re-
sults." Lazarus pointedouttbat 
his and Powell's data-,ather-

Probably Won't APPHi 

ing Included a massive com-
puter codification of the 
careers of over 500 governors. 

"I don't really mind all tbe 
work, tbough," he noted, 
"because I feel this is tbe most 

, important learning experience 
I've had. It's great working 
with Dr. Kernell, since in our 
case it's also his project, be's 
learning with us. He keeps in 
touch witb us regularly." 

" Also," Lazarus continued, 
" it's fantastic practical ex-
perience. I'd bad a hunch since 
last year that I wanted to go into 
poJi sci as a career. With this , I 
actually got to see what it was 
like to write a project, to do the 
research, to work closely with 
one professor. Tbat's some-
thing most undergraduates 

don't really get to do. Now, I'm 
certain this is what I want for a 
career." 

Revelle Senior Laura Bloom 
takes a similar outlook on the 
Biology 199 project she is 
working on at Scripps Clinic. 
"There's a lot of rewards in the 
work I'm doing," Bloom said. 
"I'm learning the laboratory 
techniques and researcb 
methods in the field I hope to 
make my career." 

Bloom' s project Involves 
finding out about a special cell 
in mice that can attack virus-
Induced cancer cells . "We 
asked ourselves, 'Why is it we 
can inject our virus into a 
newborn mouse, and it will 
develop an immunity, wbile

relUlation that you can find in

Ellla added that "the .. ddest 
part of tbeae whole proceedlnp 
is that the reai laaue, the real 
criminal conduct, that of South

UC Berkeley Police Chief Ed

Of concern to the Center is the 
possibility that the admlnia-

offensive thrust by the HANDS folks in

The SHIELDERS rely on the guile

Waiting to spoil the party for these

Swlm'mers Should Stroke to Top Year 
By .... Gee&z 

SeIIIIr S&.n w .... 
Witb four returnin. All-

AmerIcan swimmers, and 
three or four more with po-
tentJal to reach the national 
cbampioDlblpa, men'. swim 
coacb Bill Mor,an baa reason 
to be pleased with 'his 1971-79 
squad. 

Hil four NAIA cbampionship 
swimmers, Joe Hernandez, 
Lance Halstead, Mark Allen 
and Jim AJronick, teamed to 
smasb every school record but 
one lut season. 

AlleD, the ' only Junior of tbe 
,roup, holds top marks for the 
100 and 200 year bacbtroke, 
and the 100 breastatroke. Now 
tralninl on the Eut Coast with 
Dartmouth, he will rejoin the 
team after ~e quarter ends. 

Sopbomores Hernandez and 
Halsted own every UCSD 
freestyle record . Sprinter 
Hernandez set the 50, 100 and 
200 free marks, and Halsted 
swam top times in the 500, 1000, 
and 1150 freestyle eventa, along 
with the 100 and 200 butterfly. 

Agronick, along with the 
other three, holds a part in 
record settln, 400 medley, 400 
free and 100 free relays. 

The team's prowess doesn't 
end with those four thou,h. 

Four Returning Ali-Americana 
Breed Optimism In UCSD Pool 

-Diver Brad Olwln, who 
previously qualified for the 
NAIA cbampionships, will add 
pointa to the Triton's dual meet 
efforll with his return. 

-Retu r nin, butterflyer 
Brian Smith, in Mor.an's 
estimation, "has a ,ood chance 
to make the championships if 
he can make the mental 
commitment. He already has it 
physically. " 

- Nelson · Howard and Gre, 
McGary, new to the team, will 
add needed depth. McGary, a ' 
freshman, wiU almost certainly 
eclipse the 200 breastatroke 
record, the only mark that 
failed to be snapped last 
season. As a hi'h school senior 
he bettered the UCSD mark. 

On the basis of these athletes, 
Morgan certainly predicts 
another successful year. "This 
team is considerably better 
than last year's because of our 
relay depth. We should be 
scoring twice as many pointa on 
relays this season." -

"We should be taking seven 
or eight people to the cham. 

pioosbips this year who will 
score points there:" 

Morgan's team has its first 
opportunity to smash some 
records Saturday in the nata· 
torium, whim they face Po-
mona-Pitzer at 3: 30. Though 
hampered by the absence of 
Allen, the UCSD coach still 
predicts a win. 

After this weekend's meet, 
the schedule ,eta tougher. The 

Triton. face three NCAA 
Division I teams, and two 
Division II teams later In the 
year. "With this schedule, 
we're ,oing to be lookin, real 
.ood if we win more than we 
lose," said Morgal). 

. " I'd rather swim against the 
good schools," he said of the 
difficult slate they face . 
"Otherwise, the time is better 
spent working out." 

Mor,an sees his coaching 
role as aidin, his swimmers 
athletically , and motiva-
tionally. And with four hours of 

workout a day, beJinnin, at 
6: 15 in the mornin" they need a 
very stron, drive indeed. 

" It's bard to maintain the 
size of the team at a non· 
scholarship school," said the 
coacb. " But the guys who stick 
it out until the end of the season 
are very motivated." J 

"I can only keep the guys' 
motivation at Ita peak for so 
long, so I try to do it at the end of 
the season. After all , no one 
remembers who won the dual 
meeta. but the national cham-
pionships are another

Spor1I EdI&or 

In tbe past UCSD's JV 
Basketball team has received 
little recolnition In ita own 
right. They've been pushed off 
center stage and into the williS 
by the Varsity . This year. 
however, tbere are a few 
players ready to change this 
Ima,e. 

"We' re going to show UCSD 
somethin, they've never seen 
before," promise team mem-
bers Steve Turner and Dana 
Bedard'. " We're gOing to try to 
pack the om. Our team is bot. " 

"I think it will take some 
time, thoulh." Turner was 
quick to admit. "We're making 
posters and Oyers and putting 
them all around to let people 
know that there is a team and 
when the games are." 

Turner and Bedard, both 
freshmen pards, are memo 
bers of a JV squad that, as 
Coach King Wayman terms It, 
"has a good nucleus." 

"These pys are out here 
because they love basketball 
and want to be members of a 
team. They do it on their own 
time, without scholarsbips and 
with very little fundin&." 

"We've lot the best talent 
that I've bad in the three yean 
I've coached here," Wayman 
remarked. "We have a ,ood 
shot at winninJ a lot of ,aRlel. 
It all depends on bow well we 
play to.ether." 

Fourteen playen make up 
this year's squad, IncludinJll 
freshmen. Amon, the three 
upper classmen are two re-
turnees from lalt year's team, 
Paul Gardner , a starUn. 
forward. and Marty Ruane. 

Good bustle and ,ood shoot-
ing are the strengths Wayman 
feels will help his team win ball 
games this season. 

"Paul Gardner and Steve 
Claiborne have .ood speed," 
Wayman commended. "Tbey 
both get down the court well 
from the front line. ' The coach 
also cited three freshmen , 
Turner, Bedard, and Aaron 
Lampkin, for their accurate 
shooting abilities. 

The billest obstacle facing 
the team at present is time. "It 
is really hard to pinpoint any 
real problem areas," Wayman 
explained. "Our defense inside 
is a little weak right now. Our 
main concern is that we have to 
learn to work together and to 
concentrate more. We need the 
time to get to know each other 
better. " 

Lack of JV teams in the area 
is another problem. "So many 
schools are getting away from 
having JV squads." Wayman 
lamented. " They don't want to 
put the time or money into the 
pro,rams, but instead con-
centrate on building the varsity

Tbacker, bil four yeara at

said. "So, I bad to convince

"It'a more than makinJ a

The main inspirations of

'The Dead' Live On 'Hero' -

Shakedown Street 
- Gratelul Dead 

The Grateful Dead have 
released one heck of an album. 
Shakedown Street contains 
little of the over· produced 
nonsense that muddled Ter. 
rapin Station , Some of the 
Dead's solidest tunes - "Good 
Lovin'," "Fire On the Moun. 
tain," and "New New Mingle-
wood Blues" (originally reo 
corded on the band 's first 
album in '67) are done in true 
rock and roll style. 

Terrapln inarked a half-
hearted stab at the mainstream 
pop market. Fortunately the 
Dead bave decided against 
abetting tbe dollar·compro-
mise madnell and are offerine 

,true fans lOme good old Dead-
ness. The Garcia-Weir IUitar 
spark is alive and well in this 
music, botb mUlicians ex-
hibiting improved abtUtles and 
m .. tery of the chordal and 
melodical explorations that are 
the trademark of the two. Bob 
Weir's vocal ability has im-
proved greatly since the early 
days of acid rock, and he 
emerges basically as a lead 
singer on most of the cuts. 

A short percussion interlude, 
"Serengeti," is indicative of 
drummer Mickey Hart's in-
fluence on the rhythmic direc-
tion of the Dead. Since 1976, 
much of the band's improvisa. 
tions hint at Latin feelings and 
mysterious reggae flavoring . 
Two songs feature some hot 
blues harp solos. markin, the 
firat barmonica muic in the 

'Dead's tunes since ttie tragic 
death of Pig. 

Garcia is still struggling with 
the rambling polyrhythmic 
motif we heard in tbe song 
"Terrapin Station" and on the 
"Cats Under the Stars" album. 

The album lacks the ex-
tended improvisation typical of 
Grateful Dead concerts, but 
such playing is really best done 
live, as anyone who has ever 
experienced a Dead concert 
knows. Thank you, Grateful 
Dead, for a solid re-entry into 
the rock and roll world.

Dear Noel: You 
Aren't Present, 
But Laughter Is 

By Jill Louise Bazeley 
CoalribuUD, Edilor 

Oh, Noel Coward. you-are so 
witty one just can't sit through 
a play of yours without thinking 
how cleverly you master· 
minded it all. Your presence is 
detectable in every quip, every 
snide remark, and your omni· 
potence overwhelms Present 
Laulbter whicb you called "a 
light comedy .. . written with the 
sensible object of providing me 
with a bravura part." 

If you were alive today, I 
think you would be pleased with 
the Old Globe Theatre's pro-
duction of Present Laupter, 
and would alree that actor Ken 
Ruta plays your " bravura" 
role with a certain expertise not 
usually seen in San Diego. , 

It has been forty years -
shall I remind you about the 
plot of Present Laughter? 
Well. it' s not very different 
from scads ol other plays 
produced in tbe same decade. 
Here goes: Garry Essendine. 
actor and well -known per· 
sonality. is ceaselessly tor· 
mented by bis wife Liz; his 
second to last mistress, Daphne 
SUllington; his latest mistress 
Joanna Lypiatt, wire of his 
business associate Hugo, and 
lover of his otber business r 
associate , Morris ; Morris ; 
Hugo; Monica, his secretary 
bird of a rare. sharp-tongued 
strain; and, linalJy, Roland 
Maule. an unusual young 
playwright with questionable 
talent, but certain schizo-
phrenia. From here, things go 
awry just as expected and we 
have another messy, 1930's 

sexual comedy. Need I say 
more? Doesn't really matter -
they're all alike. It's Present 
Laurhter, or what you will . 

Craig Noel has skillfully 
directed this production of the 
play, being performed at the 
Spreckels Theatre . The actors 
are all competent, though you 
might balk at the way some of 
them say " Morris " and 
" Garry" with their Southern 
California accents banging out 
of "standard English" like 
shirttales from tuxedos. But not 
to mind - they do you justice 
even so.

this production, however, is the 
set. If only you could see it. Mr. 
Coward - it is so ricb and 
beautiful with some areas 
lapsing into the sumptuously 
decadent, while others main-
tain the traditional English 
starched collar standards (rom

We complain that UCSD is 8 
lonely place. The retention rate 
is IDcredibly low. UCSD does 
not have a ainlle campus-wide

can a community build an

Maybe we need to talk and 
maybe we sbould set up some

of sperm wbales will fall 
because tbe breeding stock

moratorium on killing tbe 
sperm wbale will "pass the

Moulton also alleged tbat the 
IWC exists only to protest the 
wbaling industry and not 
wba1es. 

The IWC was establlsbed in 

lM7. The Japanese and Rus-
sians are memben of the IWC. 
The 'Ruulana were not present 
at the openiq of the La Jolla 
conference because of visa 
problema, but plan to attend. 

Moulton condemned tbe 
catsup Incident as creating 
problems in establishing good

teams to play games." 

Wayman feels that the ex-
perience of playine on a JV 
squad is more beneficial to an 
athlete than aittiq on the bencb 
as a VaraJty team member. 
"On the JV team we're pre-
pariq playen for the Varsity 
by glviq them playing experi-
ence. Some playen wiU move 
up to the Varsity before the 
year is out, othen will move up 
next year. "Wbatever they do," 
Wayman added, "we will have 
sharpened their skills and 
hopefully built up a little 
pride." 

In their pre-season scrim-
mages the team performed 
well. "We are really strong,"

ourselves between tbe bar-
poons and wbales but don't 
board Soviet ships." 

Eartbforce was formed by 
members of Greenpeace who 
split from tbe group. Jeff 
Moorehead, spokesman for San 
Diego Earthforce and Warren 
College fresbman, said tbe 
group advocales "active con-
frontation" yet doesn't exist to 
cross legal Unes.' , He said there 
are about five to six Earthforce 
members in San Diego and that 
they are planning other "local 
environmental conflicts." 

Greenpeace will be marcblng 
outside Southwest Fisheries for 
tbe duration of the conference. 

Turner commented. In the 
season opener last Tuesday 
nlgbt against Point Lorna the 
Tritons came out on toP. 92-81. 
In sbooting, the Tritons sbot 
62% from the fioor and 75% 
from the freetbrow line to 
defeat their opponents. 

"I substituted a lot," Way-
man explained. "Nine people 
got a cbance to play. I believe in 
substitutinl as often as POI_ 
sible. It keeps the players fresb 
·and it also generates more 
interest in the game." 

Wayman's goal for the sea-
son seems to be a very at-
tainable one: "to win more 
games than we lose. We've got 
a good cbance to do it if we stick 
togetber. "

DIane AImala calla tile fine 
artt.tI performiDI at UCSD for 
the '171-71 year. "the flDeat we 
bave ever bad an opportunity to 
present." Annal a explained 
that New York is the center for 
the performilll arts, and the 
artista tour on a two-year cycle. 
"Really ,ood companies seem 
to tour at the same times -
every other year," she said. 
"This year we bave bad the 
fineat dance companies and 
tbeatre ,roups. We have a 
terrific season this year. Next 
year will be tougher; we will 
bave to work twice as bard to 
get them." 

Accordinl to Annala, tbe 
purpose of University Events is 
to offer quality entertainment

However. the .... of llaode-

"Next year, unl ... Rei Fee 
livea us more .upport, we will 
be forced with the option of 
either ral.inI ticket prices of 
briDlinI in fewer compaDies," 
she added. 

It'. difficult for University 
Evenu to work on a controlled 
buqet, explained Annala. "It'. 
also difficult to determine at 
the belfnniq of the year wbat 
we will pay for events .. . 
because the cost of livilll is 

IOiDI up." BeiDI tbird on the

in fNltration, .tated Anaala. 
"We bave never worked as 
hard to set up rock concerts and 
talk to promoters, a. we have 
tbi. year." Tbe problem? 
Economic.. "Eilht years alO, 
the average price for a lood 
group was around $3,500. At 
that time, it was easy to hold a 
concert in the gym. Everythinl 
we "uied (this year) was .. 
7,500 - this wasn't even the bl. 
ones." 

"Students want to see name 
acta," Annala continued. "The 
gym is so .mall ... and we want

injections in older mice kill 
them? ' You wouldn't believe 
the incredible amount of work 
that stems from such a ques-
tion. Also, the 16 hours a week I 
work here always seems to 
come at times like late-night 
and during the weekend. Tbat 
really cuts into my leisure 
time." 

Bloom then related how she 
worked with a test that assays 
for the presence of killer cells 
tbat destroy the induced cancer 
cells in the mouse's body. " Not 
only do I get to work with a 
cancer-causing 'virus and 
dangerous radioactive cbemi-
cals, but I also bave to be 
careful about little things sl\cb 
as setting the lab on fire with a 
bunsen burner. That's almost 
happened! " 

, . Actually ," Bloom con-
tinued, " it's the people in the 
lab bere that make this project 
worthwbile. I feel really lucky 
that I'm in such a super lab. 
Everyone here is always 

willing to answer questions, 
and they ' re very nice and

Kernell, who is the advisor 
for Lazarus. agreed with both 

student's outlook on the re-
wards of a special studies 
course, but added a word of 
caution. "These courses are not 
easy credit, and it requires 
persistence, self-motivation, 
and a lot of bard work from a 
student."
