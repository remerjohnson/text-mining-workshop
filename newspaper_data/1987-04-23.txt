U.S. warfare tactics discussed There was also concern that ballots may have been ml marked, 
due to Incorrect placement in the-

Mutual Assured Destruction 

(MAD), tactical nuclear warfare 
and the trateglc Defense Initiative 
were discussed by Lawrence 
Freedman, Professor of War 
tudies at King's College. London, 

last Friday In the MUir orth 
Dining Room , dUring the second 
in a three part eries on 
International ecurity. 

Professor Freedman fo used on 
the problem of MAD and the view 
in the early 70 that it contained, 
as Freedman put it, "A number of 
flaws , which were gradually 
believed to be devastating, a the 
seventies went on ... . The basic 
problem of Mutual Assured 
Destru tion wa that It eemed to 

. ffer no gUidelines for what to do If 
deterrence failed ." 

Essentially, then , while A1neri a 
had made promises to initiate 
nuclear war on behalf of her 
European allie , she could not do 
so Without Inviting total 

. de tru tlon of both the Soviet 
Union and the Untted tates. 'The 
U SR, meanwhIle , rejected MAD, 

• Instead relYing on a carryover of 
pre-nu lear strategy Into the 
nuclear age . The resulting 
philo ophy treated nuclearwar not 

taffWnter 
as "Massive attacks upon people, 
places, but conceived of it as an 
additional son of military option, 
in which the objective would be to 
disarm the enemy," Freedman 
said. 

Throughout the '70s, American 
policy evolved to the point where 
tactical nuclear strategy, or what 
Freedman called "the operational 
an," became thinkable. And during 
the early years of the Reagan 
administration, an attempt was 
made to search for the "offensive 
trategy," with the feeling that they 
auld finally create what Freedman 

called "the Ort of nuclear optIon 
that had eluded the previous 
generation of American nuclear 
planners." 

This was the IIrst stage of the 
Reagan admini trJtion' nuclear 
strategy. It came about. according 
to Professor Freedman, becau e 
"the oviet Union eemed to have 
these options [tacti al nuclear 
warfare] too, and It was important 
to disabuse the Soviet Umon of the 
notion that they ould take 
advantage of these options In a 
cnsls or a war. It was, therefore, 
countervailing. because It removed 

OVlet options, r,uher than creared

UCSD admits over 
8,000 new freshmen 

According to recent figures, UC D 
receIved the founh largest amount of 
fre hmen admiSSIon applications (\8.179) 
I n the UC system 

UCLA (23,507), Berkeley (21 ,598), 
and anta Barbara (19,027) received the 
most apphcations. UC Riverside (7,5 -+5 ) 
and UC Santa Cruz had the least 
amount of applications and remain able 
to admit all eligible applicants. 

As of April 10, UC D admitted 8,032 
freshmen ; however, all of those admitted 
arc not expected to accept. UC Santa 
Barbara admitted the most freshmen 
(10,359) of the eight ranked campuses. 

Over 83 per ent of the final 63,055 
applicants for fall 1986 were admitted at 
one of the campuses selected by the 
students. The rest were enher inVIted to 
apply to a UC campus with space still 
available , or were Ineligible for 
admiSSIOn . 

Due to the large number of eligIble 
applicants and limited space in selected 
discipltnes, the maJonty of the 
campuses are olTering numerous 
alternatives to eligible applicants, 
ranging from a change of major to 
deferred admiSSIOn at the same campus 
for the subsequent term. 

Some campuses arc also oITenng 
enrollment in the Umverslty ExtenSIOn 
cla ses or In ommunlt)/ colleges with 
the guarantee of admISSIon to the 
UniverSIty at a later date , provided the 
students successrully complete lower 
dIVISIOn requirements.

National self-definition 
to be addressed in lecture 

Two distinguished scholars will 
address the difficult task of national 
self-definition complicated by ethnic 
and racial diITerences when UCSD 
presents the fourth in a series of six free 
public lectures April 24 honoring the 
Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. 

The lecture, titled "Nationalism," is 
pan of the Clayton H. Brace Memorial 
Lecture Series, one of several events 
including a library exhibit and an 
academic symposium scheduled 
throughout 1987 to honor the U.s. 
Constitution. 

The April 24 lecture will feature 
Professor Richard Beeman of the 
UniverSity of Pennsylvania and Professor 
Ralph L. Woodward , Jr., ufTulane 
University. Professor Woodwrd is an 
expert on the hIstory of Central America 
where an intense and fragmented 
nationalism lies behind many of the 
region's current problems. 

National self-definition was a 
peculiarly dIfficult task for the newly 
independent nations in the Western 
Hemisphere because pf ethnic and

The lecture will be held at 7:30 pm in 
UCSD's Peterson Hall on the Third 
College Campus. For fulther

New bill 
simplifies aid 
By j.w. AKERS-SASSAMAN 

SACRAMENTO, UC W, .. !' - A bill 
slmpltfying the CalifornIa financial aid 
process by making it more closely 
match federal requirements won 
approval from the Senate Education 
Committee last Wednesday, April 8, 

enate Bill 602, by Senator Marian 
Bergeson. R-Orange , would "correct the 
major obstacles confronting students 
seekIng financial aid,"Gary Jerome, one 
of the senator's consultants, said. 

The bill would simplify the 
application process by allowing the 
Student Aid Commission to use 
administrative law process, instead of 
the more "cumbersome" legislative 
process, to change the definition of 
what is a resident for financial aid 
purposes, he said. 

Under the administrative law 
process, the commission would be 
authorized to adopt regulations "with 
appropriate review," rather than by 
petitioning the Legislature for action. 

. SAC officials have indicated that they 
WIll change California requirements to 
mirror federal standards, Jerome said. 
which will case restrictions, 

California residents not only pay a 
lower tuition at the University of 
Calirornia, but are also eligible for a 
Significantly greater amount of state 
financial aid . 

SACs changes would also "grcatly 
reduce the amount of mind-numbing 
paperwork" needed to complete the 
formsJerome said, which will make the 
UC financial aid officials' Jobs 
Significantly less demanding. This will 
benefit students because financial atd 
l:ounselors will be able to process 
applications mote ''''jclrl¥. 

The biD has drawn wide suppOrt, 
including the backing of the university an, ~e UC student Association. 

In other aCllOn of interest to students, 
the committee also approved a Senate 
Bill authorizing the placement of an 
$800 million higher education facilities 
bond proposal on the 1988 baUot.

the "dminlstnltion, terminating it 
on favorable terms, which is a nice 
wa}' of saying winning. 

"The problem with prevailing .. , 
I is] ir (OU talk about it with toO

to sound scary ... . [n the context of 
deteriorating East-West relations, 
landl the development of a protest 
movement in Europe ... it became 

rem,lining strategy would be total 
destruction or the Untted tJtes. 

What IS left, then? Reagan 
expressed the hope that someday 
nuclear weapons would be 
"rendered impotent and obsolete;" 
and only if SDI succeeded at this 
task could it be considered a truly 
radical depa !ture from past nuclear 
stateg}'. Freedman noted that "The 
March 23, 1983 speech marked a 
clear break from the concern with 

" ., ' it is unlikely that SOl will endure much beyond 
its current state, and if it does, it will not have taken us 
away from mutual assured destruction" ,II 

-Lawrence Freedman, professor of war studies 

diflkult for the administration to 
sustam the prevailing line ." In sum, 
said Freedman, 'The climate was 
not conducive to a theory of 
nuclear victory." 

A short time later, President 
Reagan made "the speech which 
opened the second stage, which 
was solving the problem or 
strategic defenses. This was 
advertised as an escape from the 
constraints of MAD, exactly the 
same objective as the initial 
strategy had been suppassed to 
achieve. IWhile this] could come 
to something , coming to 
something is not the same as 
proViding an escape from MAD. If, 
in the end, we deploy (SOl], [this] 
will not take us out of the regime of 
MAD, land] if anything, it could 
reinforce it," Freedman said. 

He explained that ir we denied 
the Soviet Union the options of 
tactical nuclear warfare, their only 

countervailing I nuclear strategyl to 
a concern with prevailing (nuclear 
strategy] ." In other words, instead 
of our nuclear policy consisting of 
knee-jerk responses to the Soviet's, 
we had finally decided to take the 
initiative and create our own - in 
this case, a defensive nuclear 
policy. 

Of course, as Freedman pointed 
out, ir the olTensive use of nuclear 
weapons was also in the back of 
the Reagan planner's minds, SDI 
was not a bad way of going about 
implementing it, too. SOl, then, 
would wholly suppOrt the first 
stage of the Reagan administra-
tion's nuclear strategy, which was, 
as noted before, an attempt to 
implement the theories or tactical 
nuclear warfare. 

However, said Freedman, 501 
was ultimately to be recognized 
more for its ideological 

implications than its technlllogkal. 
ones, which consisted of financial 
boosts ((l Americu's mIlitary-
industrial complex rather than ,In 
actu.II, workable "sp.lce shIeld" 
agaInst nuclear miSSIles. "The 
promise of diminished .. . 
technical and budgetary 
implicatlons ... are looming larger 
and larger, and with the President's 
weaker political position it is 
unlikely that 501 will endure much 
beyond its current state, and if it 
docs, it will not , as some have 
inSisted , taken us away from 
mutual assured destruction, but if 
anything, it will have reinforced 
the status quo." 

We come then to the third stage 
of the Reagan administration's 
nuclear str.ttegy - arms COntrol. 
Once pursued as a sort of hopeless 
quixotic quest, arms control is now 
actively sought as a way to 
diminish the quantity of nuclear 
weapons in the superpowers' 
arsenals, Mutual Assured Survival 
was the new name of the game, 
and , as Freedman said , "[t was 
perfecdy logical for the Soviet, and 
the British, and the French 
governments to make any 
reductions in defensive arms 
contingent upon no strategIc 
defenses .... The logic in strategic 
defense was to reduce the 
offensive threat, to make it 
manageable for the strategl 
defense , but why stop at a midway 
point? If you keep on bringing 
down the offensive threat, you 
don't need strategic defenses at 
all." 

This led Freedman to observe 
that the point of the administra-
tion 's critique was very similar to 
the critique made by the radicals 
on the left in Europe. There is an 
enormous similarity between 

American hawks and European 
doves on these issues. Both of 
them believed that the 
Imernational order depended on 
the n,lture of the triltcgic 
rel.ltionshlp between the Soviet 
Union and the United Sta tes. Both 
or them believed that that strategic 
rel,ltionship was extraordinarily 
delicate, and could be upset by 
technological breakthrough. Both 
of them despaired with traditional 
,Irms comrol as being insulTiciently

That option was the Zero-

which "disarmed the disarmers" by 
taking over their philosophyof"no

had not yet been placed in

made that the Soviet Union would 
never accept th is proposal. 
However, since then the cruise

Elusive reality 

A norion which has contin ually perplexed me as a college senior 
IS rhe repeared reference to rhe "real world ." According to what I've 
been told , I will be entering this unfamiliar territory on June 14 and 
I'd Ii ke to know whal's I n store . Please, someone, allYlHlc, e xpla I n 10 
me what I have been domg these past four years in this "dream 
world" (assuming that dream-like I rhe anmhesls of real). 

The 16-hour days (sometimes 24, as almost every college senior 
has experienced) and the numerous per onas, including full-time 
student, newspaper swff member, fnend and mdividual have been 
quite challenging and fulfilling dunng rhe past four yea rs . The 
courses I have raken , the parties I have anended, the wages I have 
earned, as well as the menwl and emotional maturation these have 
brought, have all been "real," very "real." And every college senior 
has man)' scars and smiles 10 show for 11. 

Ye , the days of makmg one's own schedule Will become a 
memory - no more Tuesday/Thursday 8:30-2 '30 classes; hence, 
no more four day weekends. But the days off were not spent 
vacationing in MeXICO or on Catalina Island as I had hoped . 
Instead, the}' were spent takmg care of business - whether It be 
related to school, the newspaper or my personalli(e. There 11<IS been 
and will always be someth1l1g to take care of. During the past four 
year , I've had some "real ," very "real ," pra tice at honmg rhis skill 
which , I beheve, Will be used frequently m thiS "real world ." 

Humans arc much more adaptable rhan we allow ourselves 10 
belIeve. So many of us fear change to the pOint that we make it into a 
bogeyman. How can people - students, parents and professors 
alike - say that specifiC commitments, sleepless nights, 8:00 am 
classes, and deadlines for papers have nor been reaP They have all 
been Imponant responslblhtles and valuable exercises m 
diSCipline, albeit on a different level 

True, the number of responsiblhlles in rease as we get older and 
thiS process IS ontmuous - fir t J job, then mJ}oile a spouse, a 
child , J house , and so on. Yet, few people conSider a childless 
couple as non-existent m the real world. Onlookers merely Jssum~ 
that the couple has not gotten 10 that step }'e1. 0, tell me , why 
doesn't thi logic apply 10 college students] Why arc our worries 
and obliga tions belittled] True , we arc liv1l1g out an early pan of the 
life cycle, but we are hvmg nevenheless. Every phase ofhfe IS pan of 
one long process which lasts until each of us reaches our last day. 

Each experience is meanmgful and the ImpreSSIOn four or five 
(or more) years of college leaves on a person is almighty and 
1I1dehble. Leaving the UCSD community and aU ItS familiarity will 
be dlfficulr, and I am the first to admit It. I seem to bid farewell to 
every eucalyptus tree I pass by (when bulldozers are nor blocking 
my view). All of a sudden , the groves ofUCSD look different, more 
beautiful and powerful, as If they know something Jbout each of our 
individual experiences here at college - the successes and failures 
(the embarrassments and the laughter. These omnipotent trees are 
a pan of a communlty I have grown to love and where I will 
1I1evltably leave a pan of myself. 

I'd like to know what "real" is , and who IS deflnmg thiS word in 
this pseudo-metaphyslcall}' oriented society of the 1980s. If these 
past four years at UCSD have not been "real ," then why do I feel so 
much more complete , Informed and exhausted] .

Wallwriters' response 

Editor: 
On Monday, April 6, a wallwriter 

was arrested 111 the Humanities 
and ocial ciences build ing and 
charged with the misdemeanor of 
vandalism . Who was arrested in 
this case is nO! important as the 
faCts behmd the occurrence , IIlce 
last eptember, Just after school 
tarred, vanous waUwriters have 

been accosted and verbally 
assaulted by a s mi mad 
protessor who e orr . 

Back in October, a w~_~w.I"'cn 
the stai rwell when rh 
appeared. He (tn. 
asked, "Do you love ,,""lIiI r', .... 'IIM'VI" 
- "Arc you

one writer becal 
verbal attacks orr us 
he tried to approach and talk

manner. The profe r

But people run into us while 
wr\ting and the vast ·oriry 
very friendly towards us d some 
even urge us on . These a 
students, but IIlclude sta 
faculty members as well. Anor 
thing IS that we regulate ourselves. 
We confine any writing to 
staircases in a select few buildings, 
we do nor write what some of us 
refer to as 'bathroom grafiui' (quite 
far from it , I might add), and we 
are , essentially, regular college 
students (meaning we arc not 
outcasts, degenerates, or transients 
wandenng onto campus). 

The writers can trace their 
hisll)ry back to somewhere in the 

mid seventies, and , as far as 
anyone knows, only one professor 
preVIous to our aforementioned 
friend had such malevolent 
feelings toward us. He, too, had 
called the police several times, but 
it IS believed that no arrest ever 
occurred . Unfortunately, they 
never bothered to look at it from 
our side. They neve r took the time 
to ask JUSt why we wnre. 

The attraction to wallwriting by 
those so inclined is enormous.

and post a response to the origin'l! 
writing. In this way, college 
becomes more than JUSt a fa tory 
for turning out graduates, Many 
years ago, a writer remarked, 
"Actually, that's the amazi ng thing 
about wallwrite rs. They 
commun icate across time, Instead 
of space. You have affixed a small 
part of your 'now' to the wall , 
allowing it to intersect with the 
'nows' of all who read." ThiS is a 
velY attractive feeling to those who 
do not want to be lorgotten the day 
aftc r they graduJte 

Some people do not understand 
what we wnre or why we write it. 
The}' ask themselves, "Wh y don 't 
the waiiwriters write letters to 
themselves or something?" Others 
arc conVinced the wa Uwriters Me 
some son of secret police or society 
and that we .Ire OUltO get them . We 
try and explain very patiendy to 
them that the reason wallwritlng is 
so unique is its absolute openness; 
and that, yes, perhaps it is an 
underground society , but that the 

nly entrance requirement IS a pen 
referably pennanent), A Inend of

sometimes we're just not capab le 
yet of laying it all on the line like 
that ". opening up so much. I 
might JUSt come down sometime 
and try those stairwells." 

As it stands now, the stairwells 
are almos t like another world, 
where there arc no rulers, no 
decisions, no government. It is not 
anarc hy, but "a band of true 
individuals grouped in a close and 
friendly way." As another writer 
once pondered - in the end, what

none of it meJns much . We don't

FUN RUN 

By LISA QUINTANA, Staff Wnter 

ALTHOUGH it may not be common knowledge, non-profit fundralsing is a large 
part of the Greek system. The 
fraternity Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) and 
radio station 91X will present the 
rock group "X" in the main UCSD 
gymnasium as a fund raiser to 
support the Feed The Hungry in 
San Diego chanty, known also as 
the Hunger Project. 

Feed the Hungry in San Diego is 
a local conservative church group. 
Although they will appreciate 
lBI's donation , they are a little 
leery of being associated With a 
rock concert. It appears that the 
greater evil in this case is hunger, 
and the manner of raising funds 
becomes less important. Basically, 
what the organization docs is 
proVide food and clothing for the 
people who come into downtown 
San Diego's shelters, many of 
whom are homeless, including 
whole families. Every Sunday, the 
food is prepared and taken to the 
shel ters where It will be served by 
15 to 20 volunteers, According to 
lBT member Gary Tegan, this 
COS tS roughly about $400 to $500, 
and they try to feed aU of the 
people they can, about 200. If the 
concert IS as successful as they 
hope, ZBTs donation will pay for 
quite a few Sundays. 

The reason that lBT chose the 
Hunger Pr0fect as the concert's 
beneficiary, according to Tegan, IS 
because they wanted to fund a San 
Diego group as "there is a greater 
impact ... there is a greater benefit 
to a smaller local organization if we 
give them ~2 ,OOO than if we give 

~2 ,OOO to Multiple Sclerosis." Also, 
the plight of the hungry and the 
homeless has become an 
increasingly important iss ue 
recently to the public, and the 
more visible a need becomes, the 
more h kely it will receive aid . 

Kevin Simon, lBT President and 
President of the Intra-Fraternity 
CouncIl (IK), feels that it is 
important that people know that 
"there's more to fraternities than 
Just parties." Many fraternities arc 
affi lIated to certain charities 
th rough their nallonal chapters, 
but ZBT IS afforded more 
autonomy ilnd picks their own 
philanthro pi C organl za tl ons. 
These range from Multiple 
Sclerosis to SpeCial OlympiCS,

usuaUy dividing their anemion 
between four or five different 
charities a year. The Special 
OlympiCS are a favorite with the 
fraterniry, and the members enjoy 
coaching the panicipants in track 
and basketball. Simon empha-
sized, "This is not something we 
are forced to do. The guys do it 
because they like to." 

This is not the first concert lBT 
has handled for charitable causes. 
Last year's "Untouchables" concen, 
for which the U.c. Regents 
underwrote ~4 ,000, benefitted the 
American Heart Association . "This 
year," Simon sa id , "we wanted to go 
a little bigger." This year's concert 
has an underwrite or~13,ooo . Due 
to a clause in X's contract With lBT, 

no outside sponsors are being 
allowed. Any support from an 
outside organization would have to 
go directly to the charity. Simon 
predicts that $5,000 10 $6,000 will 
be raised for the Hunger Project, 
and ZST hopes to present the 
check to the organization on the 
television show "Sunrise San 
Diego: 

There are three reasons to 
auend Friday night's concert: 1) To 
contribute to a worthy cause, 2) 10 
support the Greek system, and 3) 
10 hear a few ncw songs from X's 
forthcoming album . Everyone 
benefits because all can enJoy a 
great Friday evening of good 
music, and a needy person will 
have something fillIng his slOmach 
on Sunday. ~ 

Prodigious Poet 
Let's Blow this Joint 

And the sky was orange, 
glowing as the streetlights 
reflected to see the stars that 
brightly gleamed. 

And the bars were boring, 
as people said 
''I'm an accountant." 
How far is that from 
"I'm 263-8947" 

And there was no ca ring, 
and the people just walked by 
not seeing nor worrying. 
Tough [0 see the tender souls 
which might not be there.

although the Rockets' regular 
season play has been diS-

third in their diVision behind 
Dallas and Utah, they still have 
quite possibly the greatest ce mer in 
the league, namely , Akeem

of the playoffs, the inside game is 
crucial. With a weapon like 
Olajuwon becoming much more 
potent. So, in the West, look for the 
Laker-Maverick conference 
championship series, with the 
possibility of a Laker-Rocket 
rematch of last year. 

Celtic-Hawk match-up . with and 
outside chance for a good-old 
Celtlc-Sixer series. 

show the young guys. 
You ma y say that the Celtics 

have no bench , but with the 
second be t record In the league, 
can you say that they really need 
one? And with Bill Walton coming 
back to help out 111 the middle, 
Boston will win the East. 

middle regardless of his age. And 
the supporting cast of Worthy, 
Scott, Green ,and Rambis is playing 
as if it had something to prove. 

. With all aue respect to the 
young Hawks in the East, and the 
hungry Mavericks in the West 

. (who have bOth compiled the beSt 
records in their franchises ' 
histories), the Celtics and the 
Lakers are still JUSt tOO tough. 

The consensus around most of 
the sports world is that the Hawks 
and the Mavericks will contend 
this year for the crowns held by the 
Celtics and the Lakers. Many feel 
that this could very well be the year 
that the hierarchies of power are 
usurped; many feel that the day for 
rwo new powers 10 ernerge has 
finaUy come. And I grant you, it 
won't always be the Celtics and the 
Lakers. But let's be honest, there's 
still too much strength there . 

And that's what It comes down 
to. The Celtics-Lakers one more 
time. The Hawks and Mavericks 
will have to wait a lillie longer for 
these "old-ti me" powers 10 step 
aside. Four of the Celtics' statting 
five including Larry Bird and Kevin 
McHale, may be playing "iron-
men" roles of over 37 minutes a 
game, and Kareem may be nearing 
forty, but these guys are tough 
veterans who still have stuff to 

The Lakers on the other hand , 
arc Simply having a tremendous 
year. They're "on a mission" as 
Magic would say. Magic is regularly 
tossing in triple-doubles while 
Kareem , though a bit less 
dominating, is doing it in the 

Perhaps one can envision the 
Rockets or Sixers clawing into the 
conference finals over the 
Mavericks or Hawks, but clearly the 
NBA Championship belongs to the 
Lakers and the Celtics. 

All the marbles? Why, the Lakers 
will W111 it aU this year, of course, 
because the Celtics have no 
bench. ~ 

In the West, it would be hard not 
10 see a Laker-Dallas conference 
championship series emerge. 
Perhaps Portland will surprise a 
few early on in the West , and my 
pick as a Cinderella team would 
have to be the current We tern 
champs, the (did we forget?) 
HouslOn Rockets. The Rockets 
have the ability to take-off in the 
playoffs, as the Lakers will attest 

In the East, one can easily see 
the Celtics and Hawks in the 
conference championship. The 
East has perhaps more challengers 
than the West, with teams like the 
Pistons, Bucks, and 76ers. But 
Milwaukee will again fall because 
they lack a dominant center, while 
the Pistons play too streaky, even 
with Isiah Thomas as their field 
general. And the Sixers haven't 
quite rebounded after trading away 
Moses Malone and their first round 
draft pick (a .k.a Brad Daughetty). 
Although the Slxers are my surprise 
pick in the East, the hurdlers Just 
seem 100 huge to clear in one 
season, even With a fiery Charles 
Barkeleyand the "last house caU" of 
a certain Doctor named Erving. 

So Inok in the East for that

Two Lectures On "Nationalism" As 
Reflected in the Constitutions of 

the United States and Central America 
by Prof. Richard Beeman, 

University of Pennsylvania and 
Ralph L. Woodward, Jr., Tulane University 

The peoples of the Americas believe they have a 
unique history, but national self~definition was a 
peculiarly difficult task because of ethnic and racial 
differences within each of the newly independent 
nations in the hemisphere. How did they come to 
define themselves in the era of revolutionary 
activity, and after? These questions will be 
considered in this pair of lectures by two 
distinguished scholars, Professor Richard Beeman, 
University of Pennsylvania, and Professor Ralph L. 
Woodward, Jr., department of history, Tulane 
University, Professor Woodward is an expert on 
the history of Central America where an intense 
and fragmented nationalism lies behind many of the 
region's current problems,

BUD UGHT TEAM OF THE WEEK 
UC SAN DIEGO ALL-STAR FLOOR HOCKEY TEAM 

This week Spuds would like to salute UC San Diego's All-Star Floor 
Hockey Team that competed in the sixth annual UCSD Roor Hockey 
Invitational Tournament This is the third straight year that UC San Diego 
has taken top honors. 

This year's tournament was extremely exciting. bringing in teams from 
as tar away as Louisiana State UniverSity. The t\M:>-day tourney saw some 
great hockey action. but the home boys outshined the rest, taking the title 
once more. The championship match pitted UC San Diego against a tough 
squad from Cal Poly San lDuis Obispo. This turned out to be an extremely 
physical game, but UCSDoutmusc~ Cal Poly, winning 2-1. Both Felix and 
Sticky Petersen scored in the winning effort. 

Once again, a Spuds MacKenzie-Bud Ught congratulations to the 
champs II

Take a walk 
on the artistic 

by trish brown 
Artwalk has come of age. 

For the third year ,local artists 
and galleries are collaborating 
to give the public a gloriOUS 
glimpse of the vast amount of 
creativity in San Diego. It's a 
combination of an art show 
tha t covers downtown - with 
200 listings, doubled from 
last year:s figure - and a 
street fair. Definitely the place 
to be this weekend. 

To inaugurate Artwalk 
1987, Marjorie Nodelman 
painted "Cubist Pep boys," a 
billboard she describes as 
•• cubist/ futurist / abstract" as 
a take-off on the Pep Boys 
ads. The piece was created by 
Nodelman, assisted by David 
Dye, in one of the quonset 
huts at UCSD, then 
transported downtown, 
where the colorful 10 foot by 
24 foot oil-and-paper art 
work now enlivens the 
northeast corner of Fifth 
Avenue and "G" Street 
downtown. 

Twenty thousand people 
are expected to participate in 
Artwalk Saturday and 
Sunday, including busloads of 
folks from Los Angeles and 
surrounding areas. 

Painter Mario Torero, 
known for his "Eyes of 
Picasso" mural that vanished 
when the building it adorned 
came down to make way for 
Horton Plaza, will be painting 
a new mural on "J" Street 
between Sixth and Seventh 
Avenues on the side of a 
produce warehouse. Using a 
handful of volunteers, he 
plans to finish the new mural 
on Sunday, making this an 
unusual opportunity to watch 
a work in progress. Torero's 
new mural ' will be called 
"Fireda-M," in tribute to 
Mexican artist Frieda Kahlo. 

Of special interest to 
UCSD students and faculty, 
Installation Gallery, a non-
profit space which recently 
expanded from 500 square 
feet to 6,000, is showing "The 
Biennial" - the works of 28 
local artists, more than half of 
whom are either UCSD 

- .; , . 
" 

faculty or graduates. The list 
includes Eleanor Antin, 
Manny Farber, Louis Hock, 
Chip Lord, Patricia Patterson, 
ltalo Scanga, Ernest Silve, and 
Liz Sisco. 

New to Artwalk this year is 
the Avenue of the Arts, 
organized by Carol Dunn, 
owner of Espresso Gallery. 
Located on Island between 
Fourth and Fifth Avenues, 
and running down Fourth 
Avenue to "J" Street, it will 
offer booths for arts and crafts 
people - one will feature 
handcrafted harps - as well 
as exhibitions and demonstra-
tions, including artists doing 
water color, acrylic paintings, 
ceramics, paper art, etched 
glass and wood carving. For 
sustenance, food booths will 
provide sushi, Gelare, soft 
drinks and hot dogs, mineral 
waters, fruit juices, salads and

Issues put to rest 
by Iwie beel and david forman 

Last night in the Revelle 
Cafeteria, the UCSD 
Undergraduate Players 
debuted their production of 
"The Pajama Game." 
Originally designed to unify 
the campus by means of an all-
campus musical, the 
production brought to the 
surface a conflict within the 
Theatre Department, invol-
ving undergraduate drama 
majors and the department's 
administration. The conflict, 
which deals mainly with the 

Theatre Department's lack of 
support for undergraduate 
dramatic endeavors, has been 
taking place for many years 
according to drama majors, 
though the actual controversy 
over tbis particular produc-
tion began in the summer of 
1986. 

The two principal students 
involved are Ira Rubenstein, 
A .S. Vice President of 
Finance, and Clare Hanson, 
drama major. The two wanted 
to do an all-campus musical in 

the same vein as the Revelle 
musical, which has been 
produced for many years. 
Hanson said, "1 felt that the 
university needed to integrate 
more among the four 
schools." The two worked 
out a budget for the 
production, and began to 
search for a theater and 
administrative support. With 
assistance from Dr. Thomas 
Bond, the Revelle Provost, an 
appointment was made with 
Dr. Richard Riddell, the 

Chair of the Theatre 
Department. He initially 
seemed receptive, yet after a 
month their proposal was 
rejected because the 
department felt that the 
musical was not experimental 
enough, and they did not want 
to risk their reputation. 

Hanson and Rubenstein 
then turned to the Chair of the 
Music Department, Cecil 
Lytle. He also was initially 
very supportive, and offered 
Mandeville Auditorium for 
auditions and rehearsals. He 
told them if they acquired the 
funds to hire a faculty advisor, 
he would make the produc-
tion a class, so that the

library and the pub. We, my 
date and I. were dressed in our 
jean jackets and high tops, so I 
must admit. at this point, we 
were a bit skeptical. The (act 
that the play. "Another 
Antigone," was a sketch of 
college life reassured us and 
seemed to set us apart from 
the crowd. And so, with 
mix{'d ('motions. we took our 
seats in the quaint little 

theatre and a'bsorbed 
ourselves in the show. 

Of particular interest to 
students, the plot of 
" Another Antigone," 
revolves primarily aro und a 
young female student trying 
to graduate from college. and 
a rigid old professor who will 
not give her the grade she 
needs until she receives her 
thesis . She lobbies to get her

The only c h arac t er 
portrayal that was less than 
impressive was that of the

the boyfriend, it was an

worked well together. 

" Another Antigone" is the 
effort of playwright A.R. 
Gurney, Jr. Gurney's many 
plays have been presented 
primarily off-Broadway and 
abroad. His most recent play, 
however, "Sweet Sue," was 

performed on-Broadway by 
Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn 
Redgrave. He has also been a 
faculty member of M.LT. for 
25 years. 

"Another Antigone" is a 
very entertaining play which 
lightly explores some 
contemporary issues as well as 
timeless conflicts between 
people. It runs until May 3 at 
the Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage in Balboa Park. Ticket 
prices range from $16.50 to 
$22.50.

Story 
by bryce tillile 

"New Age" is a label that 
Liz Story has some problems 
with. The pianist, an ex-
Windham Hill recording 
artist who now records for 
RCA/Novus, will be 
perfOrming at the La Paloma 
Theatre in Encinitas this 
coming Saturday night at 7:30 
pm. She sees the term as a 
marketing tool that has 
become synonymous with 

ascension, humanisti c 
psychology, light and warmth. 

"It's a cultural pheno-
menon that is hard to justify 
musically. It's interesting that 
it occurs at a time when the 
world, the news, the media, 
everything that we see and 
hear is collapse, is dissent, is 
exactly the opposite of such 
ideas. When you look at the 
condition of the culture, 
there's always somewhere 
where there is a need to 
express a vision that goes 
beyond itself. As we get closer 
to this situation of WWlII, 
BOOM!, the "New Age" 
appears. This is a vision that 
the culture itself needs. " 

Story is not one to ignore

political overtones. All o ne 
has to do is to listen to her 
version of "My Country 'Tis 
of Thee" that she calls "Myth 
America" on her RCA/-
Novus release, "Part of 
Fortune." 

"I wrote that piece because 
I was doing a benefit for 
medical-aide to Nicaragua. 
There was a slide show that 
had pictures of artwork by 
children in Nicaragua which 
was mostly pictures of 
helicopters. soldiers and the 
army. So I did the song with 
that concert in mind, and that 
whole feeling about what's 
going on. If you're making a 
statement about beauty, or 
human value, or human 

worth, it's political at this 
time. The problem with "New 
Age" music is that it is so light 
minded, it totally ignores its 

'own shadow. It's like we're 
either way over here in 'star 
wars' (refering to much of the 
ethereal, electronic music that 
has been lumped into the 
category) or we're way over 
here in harps, and ascension, 
and warmth, and love, and 
blah, blah, blah." 

Musically, Story's compo-
sitions derive from a melting 
of musical influences . 
Classical piano study at 
Julliard and Hunter College in 
New York, combined with 
absorbed radio-rock from her 
teen years and an infatuation 

with the improvisation and 
harmonic voicings of jazz 
pianist, Bill Evans, leads to 
what most choose to label 
"New Age," though such a 
catch word is something Story 
would personally like to avoid 
in .describing .her own music. 
"I'm basically in the category 

of American Popular music -
folk music not in the sense of 
someone standing and singing 
and holding a guitar, but in an 
older sense of that word. I 
have one teacher who is from 
Brazil whosaysmymusichasa 
very American sound, very 
much in the tradition of 
Copeland. He doesn't know 
anything about this 'New Age' 
marketing thing."

participants would earn units 
for their work. After raising 
the funds and hiring Cindy 
Earnest (director of the 
UCSD Wind Ensemble and 
Pep Band) to assemble and 
conduct an orchescra, they 
returned to Cecil Lytle only to 
learn that he had changed his 
mind. His reason was, as 
Hanson put it, "He didn't 
trust us." 

After being "stonewalled" 
by both the Theatre and 
Music Departments, Ruben, 
stein used his Associated 
Students position to attend an 
Honor 's banquet, hoping to 
speak to Chancellor Atkinson 
about the problem. By this 
time, in the winter quarter, 
they had dropped hopes of 
receiving units for their work, 
and concentrated only on 
getting a theater. Rubenstein 
was referred to Robert 
Ritchie, the special assistant 
to the Chancellor, and to 
Provost John Stewart of Muir 
College. Things finally began

to happen, but it was too late 
- the Warren theater had 
been booked by the Theatre 
Department. They decided 
once again to stage the play in 
the Revelle cafeteria. 

Since the decision, Hanson 
and Rubenstein have been 
openly critical of the Theatre 
Department and its role in the 
affair. The department's 
refusal to cooperate forced 
the pair to buy their own 
costumes and props, expenses 
totaling nearly $600. They 
feel that this example merely 
represents an ongoing 
problem in the Undergrad, 
uate Drama Program. 
Rubenstein, a management 
science major himself, 
claimed that there is nothing 
for the undergraduate drama 
major to do in his field, except 
assist grad ua te student 
productions . "They are 
credited slaves to graduate 
student productions," 
Rubenstein assessed . (A 
mandatory two,unit course 
for the major, Drama 100, 
involves constructing sets, 
working with lights , and 
rehearsing with graduate

students for graduate 
productions.) 

One of the problems, as 
Hanson sees it, is that the 
Theatre Department is trying 
to maintain their fine national 
reputation for graduate work. 
The undergraduates are the 
ones who suffer. "It's very 
frustrating knowing that even 

if I auditioned for a play, I 
would never get the lead 
because the plays are pre<ast 
for the graduates." She 
suggests that an undergrad, 
uate hair be created in the 
Theatre Department, so that 
undergraduate concerns are 
more adequately considered. 

Rubenstein was not as 
diplomatic in his assessmen::, 
pinpointing Dr. Riddell as the 
most guilty player in the 
affair. "As a chair," 
Rubenstein stated, "he should 
have the capacity to help 
undergraduates. We weren't 
even asking for funding. We 
just wanted a theater for two 

weeks." With so little 
opportunity for the drama 
major, Rubenstein finds it 
ridiculous that the Theatre 
Department would turn their 
backs on offering their 
students an outlet for their 
craft. Laughing, Rubenstein 
suggested, "We have been 

labeled the rebels (by the 
Theatre Deparment)." 

Though both Rubenstein 
and Hanson are graduating 
this June, they have already 
begun dealing with the 
administrative aspects of next 
year's production, hoping not 
to run into the same problems 
that they did this year. "The 
underlying problem is that 
there's just not enough 
facilities on campus," 
Rubenstein commented. 
They are also in the process of 
turning the "UCSD Under, 
graduate Players" into an 
Associated Students organiza' 
tion. 

This year's musical 
production of "The Pajama 
Game," written originally by' 
Jerry Ross and Richard Adler 
as a stage production that was 
then turned into a 1957 Doris 
Day film, hopes to do well 
despite its rocky beginnings. It 
has as a cast 27 undergraduate ' 
actors from all four colleges. 
The play runs through April 
26. Tickets are $2 at the box 
office and $2.50 at the door. 
All shows start at 8 pm.
