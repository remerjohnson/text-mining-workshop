Volume 42, Number 4 U niver ity of California. San Die~o T hursday, Janua r y 15, 1981 

It is believed that for a man to 
lay down his hfe for the love of 
others is the supreme sacrifice. 
Jesus Christ by his own example 
showed us that there is no 
greater love. For nearly two 
thousand years now we have 

. been, striving to have the 
strength to follow that example. 
Martin Luther King was a man 
who had that strength. He 
showed us, non-violently, a 
better way of life, a way of 
mutual respect, helping us to 
avoid much bitter confrontation 
and inevitable bloodshed. We 
still have a long road to travel 
until we reach the world that 
was his dream. We in the 
United States must not forget 
either his supreme sacrifice or 
that dream. 

I and a growing number of 
people believe that it is time for 
our country to adopt legislation 
that will make January 15, 
Martin Luther King's birthday, 
a national holiday, both in 
recognition of what he ac~ieved 
and as a reminder of the 
distance which still has to· be 
traveled. 

Join me in the observation of 
January 15, 1981 as a national 
holiday.

Auto import analysis flawed 
Editor: 

A recently printed article by Walter Adams 
titled "Import Quotas a Wrong Solution" 
(GlUWdia", Jan. l2) condemns the US auto 
industry for creati~ the problems it is now 
strulllrhng with. I thmk his assessment of the 
problem is superficial and his recommendation 
against import quotas likewise in error .. 

To understand the crux of the issue one 
needs to know a few facts of how the Japanese 
got into the automotive business. I t was by and 
large through their government's interest in 
motorcycles for military use (Military Vehicle 
Subsidy Law of 1922, see Motorcyclist, Nov. 
1980). 

Indeed, the largest selling motorcycle in 
Japan, Harley-Davidson, was banned from 
import. However, American assembly line 
technology and p,.tent rights were bought and 
adopted under government policy. In other 
wontsJ their; motorcycle_ industry. was. 
developed as a government project and was 
totally protected by import laws. 

Americans will buy. 
I feel that many of the facts presented by 

Adams are misleading.in his attempt to point a 
finger at the "Big Three." Car manufacturers, 
like any other business, only make products it 
can sell. There was no moral perogative for 
them to build small cars when gasoline cost 30 
cents per gallon in 1970. At that price the 
average driver would have saved only about 
$150 per year in gasoline in a small car 
compared to a large car. In view of the higher 
death rate among passen~ers with small cars, 
this small savings is dubiOUS at best. 

If a culprit exists for perverting the car 
business in the US, it is the oil companies. 
Harry Truman pointed out in 1951 that we 
were running out of domestic fuel. However, 
the oil (,Xlmpanies and power companies 
encoura~ the pu blic to use more and more 
energy through its advertising. It is no wonder 
that --most Americans did hot believe {hat 
domeStic oil was"beginning to dwindle i"lntil 
some years after the 1973 embargo. 

Their auto industry developed similarly as 
offshoots of other Japanese heavy industries. Until 1970, the American car was a terrific

into the belief that the gun· 
control issue rests" solely on 
the . " lives taken" versus 
"lives saved" aspect. 

As the article s tated , 
"There i no clear evide}lce 
that the possession of guns 
saves more lives than it 
takes . " Since crime s 
involving gun-related 
murders , s uicide s and 
accidents are faithfull y 
recorded by hordes of 
government bureaucrat s , 
there exists an accurate 
source of the "lives taken" 
category (excluding self· 
defense killings). The "lives 
saved" category, to include 
such actions as crimes 
deterred by armed citizens as 
well as self·defense killings, 
can only be estimated. 

It is inevitable that gun-
control advocates grossly 
underestimate these inci-
dents since they, quite 
obviously, do not share the 
experiences that many gun-
owners have had. It is not 
difficult to present events in 
which the very presence of a 
firearm has stopped the 
potential for violence before 
they start - a highly 
desirable characteristic that 
non-lethal weapons such as 
mace and aikido don't 
possess. 

Thus, the very aspect of 
firearms that gun·control 
advocates despise, its ability 
to kill, has a definite 
tendency to save lives by 
permitting the citizen the use 
of an adequate weapon with 
which to deter or, should it be 
necessary, defend himself. 

It is truly unfortunate that 
the e incidents cannot be 
statistically recorded as I am 
confident that they would 
clearl y indi cat e that a 
properly used firearm (and 
nearly all are properly used 
- only those that are 
misused make the headlines) 
can save a tremendous 
number of lives, and usually 
without the need of a shot 
even being fired . 

To sum up my po ition on 
the issue, we cannot afford to 
legislate a gun prohibition, 
even if the decision were 
based soley on a "lives saved-
lives taken" criterion. Of 
course, the right of a citizen 
to an adequate self-defense 
weapon; the legal and 
constitutional implications; 
the desirability of an armed 
citizenry for national defense 
(on the model of Switzerland 
or Israel); the difficulty of 
enforcing a gun prohibition 
(witness drug and alcohol 
prohibition) and so on, all 
haven't even been touched 
upon. 

As much as the govern· 
ment would like the 
authority to make decisions 
for Us concerning gun 
,lwnership, and no matter 
how much gun control 
advocates are willing to trust 
the government with these 
liberties, we, as free people, 
must have the courage and 
conviction to retain these 
rights or face a gradual 
erosion of all of our rights as 
individuals.

Regents vote on 
. '.knoll' land today 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
Executive Editor 

A proposal that would prevent commercial development of 
the university's La Jolla cliffs property due west of campus 
may be approved at the UC Regents meeting in San Francisco 
today or tomorrow. 

The land, known to university planners as . "the knoll. " is 
part of a larger land package that the Re.l!ents are to cons ider 
mduding in a systemwide environmental protect ion 
program, the Scripps Shoreline-Underwater Reserve of the 
Natural Water Reserves sy tern. 

Much controversy has surrounded pre ervation of the 
knoll land. [n the pas t ... some authorities have' ·: suggested 
selling the valuable land in order to raise desparately needed 
funds for university projects and programs. 

But according to one source involved in lobbying and 
educating the Regents in the matter, both UC President David 
Saxon and UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson support the 
idea of preserving the knoll. thus improving the chances that 
the measure will be approved. 

Much of this official support w~s spurred by significant 
archeological finds at the site several years ago, according to 
Student Body President's Council Chairwoman Linda Sabo. 
She feels it is "bigger than a campus-wide issue because of the 
possible archeological implications" there. 

But the proposal may face stiff opposition .from several 
Regents, Sabo said . Regent Edward Carter and others are 
"thinking in terms of how much money we can make from 
selling what we have." she said. 

Sabo feels. however, that the economic beneJits from selling 
the knoll may be minimal as a recent assessment of the land 
was "very low." . . 

University planners have speculated that the bid was well 
below that expected because of "all the hassles" involved in 
developing the land , she said. . . 

Because of its prime location overlooking the ocean, many 
permits and environmental impact investigations would be 
necessary before any building began. 

"Unless 'Someone nail s (proves illegitimate) the 
assessment." Sa~ said, the motion "has a good chance of 
passing. 

"But the Regents are like a big AS ... you really can 't tell how 
they will vote until they actually vote." she added. 

Regents DeWitt Higgs. Joseph Moore. John Rosston. Allan 
Goodman and student Regent Le lie Lurie. all of whom 
recently visited the area covered by the propo al. "are leaning 
to puttJng it Into the reserve." Sabo said .

8 The G!!ardian 

Mix-up excludes women, 
others from PE·classes· 

By .rAul FARWELL 
Misunderstanding and 

. confusion plagued the 
Physical Education depart· 
ment last week as students 
tried to add classes. 

During the first days of 
classes, male and pre-med 
students were given en trance 
priority over all ot her 
students attempting to get 
into the popular jazz and 
aerolic dance classes. 

"Admitting pre-meds and 
malel above everyone else is 
not the department policy," 
oommented Howard Hunt, 
chairman of the PE 
department. "Our (the 
department's) orientation 
apparently didn't get the job 
done with our dance 

. teachers. We made some 
mistakes. We should be 
chewed out," he said. 

Patricia Rincon, dance 
instructor and acting dance 
coordinator during the 
absence of Margret Marshall, 
on sabbet ical, gave priority to 
several males and pre-meds 
trying to enroll in a class. 

"There were three spaces . 
open and I saw these three 
guys standing there, so I let 
them in," said Rincon. "It 
was a gut reaction. I felt sorry 
for them. Later I realized it 
was a mistake." 

. . 

\\ h' 
*** ... wort 

Apparently the pre·med 
situation was a mi under· 
standing. "I meant . to say 
medical. not pre-med," 
comm."ted R.incon. "It 
occured to me after [ had let 
in about six pre·med 
stl!dents. Fortunately, the 
misunderstanding has been 
cle¥ed up," said Rincon, who 
says she will not make the 
same mistake again. 

Aocording to a spokesman 
in the Registrar's Office, the 
PE department can't be 
charged with any wrong· 
doing. Each department is 
allowed to establish its own 
rules concerning the 
add/drop procedure. 

The PE depart men!' s 
policy allows for the 
admittance of PE minors and 
medical school students 
above all others attempting 
to add a class. "The only 
reason we do this is because 
med students are unable to 
pre-enroll in undergraduate 
classes," explained Hunt. 

Only 10 medical school 
students are enrolled in PE 
classes this quarter. 

Once the exceptions have 
been made, a lottery system 
is used to determine which 
students fill the remaining

Josh Cohen. one of the 
three males given priori ty by 
Rincon, also felt Ricon 's 
lottery system was unfair. 
"Even though it was to my' 
advantage, I don't t hink she 
should have done it," said 
Cohen. 

Most other st udent s 
contacted by the Guardian 
thought Rincon was fair in 
what she did . " I think it 's 
great that guys are taking 
jazz dance ," commented 
Debbie Quick, a student now 
in a beginning jazz dance 
class. 

Since there are usually at 
least 20 students trying to 
add dance classes, most PE 
facuty members feel the 
lottery system is the most 
democratic way of deciding 
who gets in. 

"If someone knows a better 
way, I'm willing to listen," 
offered Rincon. 

Miles 
continued from page 6 

"Right now, we're losing 
students to Berkeley and 
other schools because we 
don't have that school. Every 
school in the system is closed 
fo transfer students right 
now, which indicates a real 
demand. 

"Also, the difference is 
important to students. 
Employers are going to 
Berkeley and UCLA before 
they come here because they 
have schools. 

"Where a top Berkeley 
engineering student will get 
five or six job offers, a 
student here will only get two 
or three." Mile argues.

Little rest for swimmers during break 
BY JIM AGRONICK 

The men 's and women's 
swim team rested very little 
during the recent Quarter 
break, continuing with 
j1Tactices and competition. 
With five team members 
preparing for national 
competition, twice·a ·day 
workouts were the norm 
during half of the team's 
vacation. 

The Triton's women's 
team remained idle during 
the break while the men's 
team travelled to Eas t Loo 
Angeles where they faced 
tough competition. The meet 
was dominated by UCSD's 
opponents, Cal State 
Northridge and Cal State San 
Luis Obispo, both NCAA 
Division n schools. Although 
not as strong as their 
opponents. the Division TIl 
Tritons had their share of 
excellent performances, 
especially in the freestyle 
events. Sprinter Kevin Lingle

Last Jan. 7, UCSD hosted 
the University of Wyomingin 
an unofficial dual meet at the 
natatorium. UW is classified 
as an NCAA Division I 
school, and this was apparent 
from their wins in most of the 
events. Despite the strength 
of their opponents, UCSD 
was able to turn in a number 
of strong performance . 

The T~iton swim team spent m~ch of their ,Winter break in the water practicing for meets. 
Coach Bill Mo~gan, sh?wn abov,,: With the men ssquad, has high praise for the team. Amember

time of 2:15.7 and a trong 
third place finish. Groos also 
placed seventh in the 100 fly 
with a time of 1:03.65.· 

Strong time in all of the 
women 's relays contributed 
to the team 's overall finish. 
Relay swimmers included 
Groos, Anne White, Jackie

Other strong performances 
included Lance Halsted's

John Lennon: Living with the memory 
From street punk to house husband 

BY MIKE THOMAS 
If peop-le bring so much 

courage to this world the world 
has to kill them to break them. 
so of course it kills them. The 
world breaks everyone and 
afterward many are strong at 
the broken places . But those 
that will break it kills. It kills 
the very good and the very 
brave impartially. 

- Enu~st Hemi1lgway 

The pain began whenever 
the radiO started playing one 
of Lennon's ongs during 
those fir s t few days, 
particularly) "Starting 
Over." Not that · it is a 
particularly great record. It's 
only that John Lennon had 
just come back after five 
year!! of Greta Garbohood 
and I was looking forward to 
hearing from this long lost 
friend I had grown up with. 

When a friend called up 
that Monday night with the 
news, I was stu nned . of 
course, but it didn't really hit 
me hard for a day or two. No 
tears came , although I 
wished they would. It was 
hard to cry for someone who 
had achieved such content· 
ment and peace of mind . 

If Lennon had bought it 

during adrunken binge in LA 
in 1974, it would have been 
tragic. But his fondest dream 
came true when the great 
love of his .Iife, Yoko Ono, 
bore him a son on his 
birthday in 1975, and he 
devoted the last five years of 

his life to ralsmg the boy 
while his wife concentrated 
on busines . 

I'd always admired Lennon 
for his caustic wit. His 
iconoclastic view matched 
mine and while growing up I 
u ed to practice the sort of 
flip put·down evident in his 
press interviews and movies. 
I guess that's why there were 
no tears; the ort of sappy 
remembrances of him by 
people who never under tood 
him or his music surely 
would have sickened him. 

The Beatles were born 
amid much hype so it only 
follows that they would die 
surrounded by the same. 

So we qu ickly have Lennon 
boo k in drug s t ores, 
medallion of John adverti ed 
in TV Guide and a full color 
cover page photo of John 
Winston Ono Lennon lying in 
the morgue, courtesy of the 
National E'1quirer at your 
local supermarket checkout 
tand. 
John Lennon died becau e 

he was a working class hero. 
and anyone who has read 
Frazer s Golden Bou!{h 
knows that the king must die. 
Elvis was killed by the 

- adulation, Lennon faced 
down the bitch godde of 
s uccess 13 years before 
retiring to become a 
househusband. His influence 
was still felt. There were 
weepy columns by hacks like 
Rolli,lg Slone's Dave Marsh 
imploring Lennon to come 
back and save the world for 
them, wile out in Hawaii a 
ecurity guard taped John' 

name on David Chapman's 
ID. 

Chapman, like Charles 
Man on , like rna t -of u 
act ually , had been pro· 
foundly influenced by 
Lennon and the Beatles. But

UEO artist Ruth Baily. "We 
want to show more foreign 
films that have a good 
reputation and blockbusters 
if we're sure that they'll be 
very popular and people will 
go to them. 

"The series is a kind of 
experiment where we can 
branch out to other series 
associated with a particular 
theme or country," s he says, 
"We cho e fantasies because 
they take in a lot. They're 
broad· based and diverting, 
They give people omething 
interest ing to see." 

The variety of the genre is • 
evident in the list of films to 
be shown in the series. They 
range from the chaotic The 
Bed Sitting Room, to the 
endearing Willy Wonka and 
the Chocolate Factory, to the 
fluid Beauty and the BeIlSt, to 
the mystical Thief of 
Baghdad. In addition to the

uc plays games with 
state budget process 
continued from page 5 
not be out of the minds of most s tate officials in this 
gloomy economic year. 

UC's share of the budget will be considered in the 
As embly by the Ways and Means Subcommittee on 
Education, chaired by Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), and 
in the Senate by the Educational Subcommittee chaired 

. by Walt Stiern (D-Bakersfield). 
There are feelings among c ircles familiar with the 

university that UC may be playing even more of a political 
game than us ual with the .Legislature this year, by 
offering to cut sensitive and potentially controversial 
student program increases in the governor's budget - in 
hopes of winning them back later, as pressure mounts. 

Last month, after it submitted its final proposal for 
1981-82, UC was ordered by the state to come up with 
millions of dollars in cuts when it became obvious the 
state was in wor e financial tate than expected . 

UC Ii ted a its first priority for cuts areas where it 
would incur least harm to existing program: increase 
for affirmative action students, more money for new 
teaching assistants for basic skills and impr?vemenL 
projects and additional funds to upgrade a remedial math 

pro~am and comlJuter training proj ct. 
UC may have set those increases as its lowe t overall 

priority at t he last minute in order to bring "political 
heat" on the Legislature tore torethecut and save other 
programs perhaps less sensitive. 

"The 'university is taking a pretty big g~mble with 
programs important to students thi year - that 's their 
strategy," said Paul Rogers, UC Student Lobby co-
director. 

Roger said that in an ex remely tig,ht budget year (the 
Legislature has squandered pre-Prop. 13 surpluses), all 
state agencies will be competing for tate funds . 

"This is a game we playevpry year with th state," aid 
Bill Eager, UC Vice Pre ident for Budg~t aAd planning. 
"Whenever the state asks us where we'd prefer to be cut, 
we don 't answer, because as soon as we do, we're cut~" 

The univers ity, which i the object of growing 
unpopularity in the Legislature, ha been given a four 

. percent rai e this year, the lowe t since World War II, and 
the state's community and stilte col,leges have been cut to 
the bone.

14 The Guardian Thursday. January ' 15. 1981 

Martin Luther. King ' 
"After finishing my schooling. I 

wei called to a little church doNn in 
Naltgorney, Alabama. I start~d 
peaching tMr~, things were going 
Wldl in that little church, it W5 a 
merwklus expaience. 

a..t one day a ~ later, IS lady by 
the name of Rosa Pn decided that 
she would sit in IS frort seat of a dty 

-bus. And this WlJ5 the beginning of IS 
rnc:Nanef1t ~ fifty thousand 
IIIc:k men IF1d women refused 
IbIoIuteIy to ride city busHs, and 
we vAlllccd together for 381 days. 

~ ~ to ~ to stick 
tICgdhcr, we sent out the call No 
Ne!POeS rode the tJusses. It was one -
'd the most amazing eYtnts I've fNf:I 
*" in rrrl li~. The people of 
NatsomerY aslced me to serve as 
spokesman, and as presicknt of the 
rrew organization. The Montgomery 
Irnpromnent Assod«ion came into 
being to lad the boycott I couldn't 
SlI( no and then we stated our 

Slru99I~ together," 
These lR the wads of Dr. Martin 
~ ICing Jr, speaking iQ retrospect 
of his life-and CNeeI' in 1966. 

MMin luther King Jr. W(J6 a man 
who had hoped to be an inspiring 
preacher in IS small cYld quiet 
community. Instead by the time of 
his death, he had led tens of millions 
in shattering the system of Southern 
segregation, He was, more than any . 
other man, the voice and instrument 
of the ~ond At)'le'ican Revotutio . 

He V\fCIS born Michael luther King 
Jr. to Rev. and 1Ws. Michael luther 
King Sr, on Ja~~ 15, 1929 in 
Atlarta, Georgia. In 1957 he and his 
father had their names changed ITam 
Michael to Martin in an Atlanta 
courthouse. 

The ASUCSO Bulletin is an 
advertisement paid for by the 
AsUCSD to give students an 
opportunity to exchange information 
about meetings, events, ~nd issues 
thl!lt concern the - campus. The 
Bulletin welcomes articles and 
graphics from the general student 
body. Our address: ASUCSO Bulletin, 
B-023 UCSO, Student Center, La Jolla, 
CA 92093. Attn: Diane Bruton, 

He 'V'oIaS a "drum Inaja for justice," 
I!I nonviolence and justice advocate. 
In this pursuit ~ng's accomplish-
ments seem endless: He conducted 
boycotts, sit-ins, and protest 
marches in Birmingham, AJ"bema, 
which influenced the passage of the 
Civil Rights Act d 1964. His march on 
Washington in August of 1963, the 
Selma voter registration aive, and his 
march to Montgomery influenced 
the pa5Sc1ge of the Voting Rights Bill 
of 1965. 'He was Time Magazine's 
Man of the Yur in 1963, The Nobel 
Ptace Prize laureate in 1964, and the 
recipient of (]tier 300 itNi!'Ids and 
honcrsy dtgrees. 

In a sermon delivered shortly 
before his death, King had this to say: 
"If any of you are around when I Mve 
to meet my day, I don't want a long 
speech. I'd like somebody to 
mention that day that Martin luther 
King Jr. tried to IOJe somebody. I 
want yoU to say thM day that I tried to 
be like and walk with them...I ju~ 
want to leave a committed li~ 
behind. Then my living will not be in 
vain." 

On Apnl4, 1968, Dr. Martin luther 
King Jr. was assassinated while 
standing on the balcony of the 
Looai ne Motel. He was a man with a 
dream in his prime at 39· 

Perhaps, this day we wi II resurrect 
the v ibrancy of the biblical passage 
from Genesis 38: 19-roo "As they sai d 
to one another, = beho (j this ' 
dreamer, ,,.let us slay him.,.and we 
shaH see what becomes of his 
dream." . . 

Admittedly, they may have killed 
the dreamer, but they have not ki lied 
the dream. It has been 13 years since 
his death, and " I still have a dream."

Reception to follow. 

_ Si nce 1967 the UCSD campus 
activity fee has been six dollars. 
During the ~me period infll!ltion has 
risen drastically, significantly 
reducing the quantity and quality of 
strVice that the Associated Students 
can provide for its student 
popull!ltion. Few students really 
IcnoIN where their activity fee mon~ 
goes. Although it does fund the 
Associated Students gcNe1'nment in 
its effort to tight tuition, drop date 
changes, and for -other student 
concerns, activity fee mon~ also 
funds the following: the new 
Associated Students Internship 
Office which offers student 
internships in Washington O.c., 
Sacramento, and San Diego; SOJRI, 
the Student Center for Undergra-
duate Research and Innovation ITom 
which students can receive grants for 
their own research projects; 
Committee for World Democracy's 
free political film series; T,G.I.F.'s; 

, Cinco de Mayo festivities; SHI.P., 
The Student Health Information 
Program; KSDT, UCSO's own which 
can be heard all Oller campus; the 
A.S.sorted Vinyl record coop at the 
Student Center; . the Food Coop; 
CAP.E., the valuable Courses and 
Professors EVilluationj over 150 
student organizati.ons and 
recreational clubs and much, much 
more. Yet all of the above are in 
serious jeopardy unless the present 
activity fee -is increased for the first 
time in thirteen years. Therefore, the 
ASUCSD Council would like to 
educate students of the financial 
tension at hand so students will be 
prepared for t!:le up(:oming 
referendum questioo involving 81'1 
activity' fee increase.

Budget 
continued from page H 
agreed to take over complete 
funding of student affirma-
tive action programs for the 
first time next year , which 
would have freed up to $1.1 
million more for student 
financial aid. This money is 
drawn from education fees 
students pay each quarter. 

Earlier, when it was 
rumored that increases for 
affirmative action students 
would probably be denied 
next year, Assemblyman 
John Vasconcellos (D· San 
Jose) had aid that it would be 
a " big mistake." 

Vasconcellos, chairman of 
the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee, former 
chairman of the Fiscal 
Subcommittee on Education 
and often an outspoken critic 
of the Re~ents, said 
affirmative actIOn "should be 
the lasl place cut are made, 
considering that is where the 
university is weakest." 

Still, UC got off fairly 
lightly in the governor's belt-
tightening budget compared 
to California's other two 
higher education systems. 
The state colleges and 
university system and 
community colleges were 
allowed no new increases. 

The governor's bud~et 
marked only the startang 
point in the overall budget 
process,

The EInpft StrIIca IecIc: The 
malevolent Darth Vader is back with a 
plan to lure Luke Sk)walker into the 
Empire's fold in this sequel to George 
Lucas' SW W .... While Sk'ywalker and 
Vader are on a collision course, the 
other good guys - Hans Solo, the 
Princess, the Wookiee and droids - try 
to evade the Empire's net without much 
success. The film is much better 
technically and features a more 
complex stotyIine than its predecessor, 
but its semi-cliffhanger ending sums a 
lot to ask \lllith a three-year wait 
between ...,w ... chapters. Still, even 
though it·s now playing in Carlsbad, at 
the CineI'M ptllZ/I 5, it's still certian/y 
wath the trip .. 

0I'dINIry People: Rooert Redfr:xd 
did a masterful job in putting together 
this film adaptation of the best-selling 
I'lOWI about hard times in suburbia. 
Mary Tyler Mtoae, II sweetheart in. TV 
land fr:x so Ions. plays the bitchy 
mother ina fami Iy that starts to 
disinteg'ate follcming the drowning 
death of a faIIorite sone. Donald 
Sutherland is her S)fTlpathetic husband, 
.Ilying to hold the family together. Both 
are good, but Timothy Gutton, as the 
younger son who blames himselffr:x his 
brother's death, and Judd Hirsch, as the 
psychologist who tries to keep Hutton 
from cracking up completely, are the 
best. In all, this is a satisfying, 
emotionally unflinching look at life. 

The Mirror CNdc'd, A leisurely, 
ICNing adaptation of the Agatha Christie 
murder mystery, featuring Angela 
Lanusbury as the ...enerable Miss Jane 
Marple. The plot concerns an aging 
mCNie QJeen, trying to make a 
comeback in a film shot in England. 
Someone, apparently, tries to poison 
hEr, but the scheme backfires and 
another person dies. "The game," as 
one famous sleuth said, "~afoot." And 
only Miss Marple can solve the case. 
With Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Tflflor, 
Kim NCNak and Torly' Curtis. 

Popeyel Jules Feiffer, a longtime 
IOwtr of the great old comic strips, 
wrote a wonderfully faithful script, 
based on the very early E.C. Sesar 
Popeye stri ps that had the mightiest 
sailO' man of them all on a quest to find 
his father. Robert Altman translated 

Fei~s script Into a m~ that catches 
the right sense cJ bizarre happenings, a 
sense so crucial to the texture of 
Popeye. And Robin Williams and 
ShElley Dwell are perfect as Popeye 
and his lit first ~Iuctant 5'Neetheart, 
Olive Oyl. T osether, this adds up to an 
altogether nice rnc:Me to IMItCh - it's 
uproariously funny, ya moral and 
touching lit the same time. Onewaming 
- If you Mwt little kids, don't * them 
thinldng they'll be able to watch this as if 
it ......e~ a simple-minded cartoon. It 
Isn't.
