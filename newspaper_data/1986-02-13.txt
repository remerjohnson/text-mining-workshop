Scripps accesses 
Supercomputer 

A new computer center that 
links marine and earth scientists 
to the San Diego Supercomputer 
Center, has been established at 
UCSD's Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, according to 
Professor William A Nierenberg, 
Scripps Institution director. ThiS 
is the first remote hookup to the 
supercomputer, 

Scripps Institution is one of 19 
members of the supercomputer 
center's consonium institutions. 
At Scripps, the new Remote User 
Access Center (RUAC) will 
provide the computer capabilities 
necessary for communications 
between individual scientists 
working at their own tenninals 
and the Cray X-MP/48 
supercomputer, located on 
UCSD's main campus. The 
supercomputer center is operated 
by GA Technologies, with major 
funding from the National 
Science Foundation. 

"This new center greatly 
expands the capabilites for all 
rypes of SCientific and research 
computing at Scripps Institution ," 
said Professor Nierenberg. 
"Professors and researchers who 
require the tremendous 
computational capacity of the 
supercomputer now have the 
abiliry for on-hne, interactive 
computing utilizing terminals in 
thei r offices." 

The Scnpps RUAC facility is 
approximately 3,000 square feet 
and is outfitted with about 
$536,000 worth of computer 
equipment. At the heart of the 
system is a Digital EqUIpment 
Corporation VAX 11 /785 
computer, a powerful super 
minicomputer. Linkage with the

supercomputer is accomplished 
through a high-speed 
communication line capable of 

handlin~ 56,000 bits per 
second. As many as M users at 
Scripps could be on the line 
simultaneously. 

The Scripps computer center 
also serves the Southwest 
Fisheries Center of the National 
Manne rlshenes Service in La 
Jolla. 

Among the research projects at 
Scripps with immediate use of 
the supercomputer are 
investigations of global climate, 
the structure of the earth, 
nonlinear dynamiCS and physical 
oceanography. 

New Guinean an 
shown at Gallery 

The UCSD Crafts 
Center/ Grove Gallery will feature 
primitive New Guinea an in its 
upcoming show, 'Contemporary 
Folk Art of New Guinea," from 
Jan . 28 to Feb. 15. 

The pieces selected for this 
show are on loan from the 
private collection of Jim Geisler. 
Geisler collected the artifacts 
during trips to New Guinea for 
his Lakeside, California import 
business. 

The Papua New Guinea 
amfacts offer a glimpse of a 
society highly inOuenced by 
religion. Certain New Guinean 
tribal ceremonies display belief 
in the supernatural. For instance, 
a rare body mask on display was 
once used in ceremonies 
involving taboos. The yam masks 
on exhibit are traditionally 
placed on those vegetables to 
give them human characteristics 
to honor the spirits of deceased 
clan members. Many similar 
objects are sull used in New 
Guinean tribal ceremonies. 

Kidney treatment 
Unit installed 

A unit which represents San 
Diego's first lithotripter arrived at 
UCSD Medical Center last 
Saturday from Germany and was 
lifted by crane to the second-
story site of the new San Diego 
Kidney Stone Treatment Center. 

The equipment, to be installed 
during the next several weeks by 
a special team flown in from the 
Demier Co. of Munich , 
Germany, will form the 
cornerstOne of the new 
Treatment Center. The first 
patient is scheduled for the 
lithotripsy procedure March 5. 

Internships Announced 
at U.c. LObby 

The U.c. Student Lobby is 
gearing up to accept a minimum 
of seven new interns at the 
Lobby office in Sacramento. 
Interns have traditionally worked 
in the area of legislative affairs 
and on special projects such as 
the Women's Desk, the Federal 
legislative Desk and in research. 
The Lobby is defining many 
other areas for student 
involvement. These include 
newsletter design , writing and 
production; public relations 
activities; conference 
coordination and grassroots 
organizing. Students from a 
variety of disciplines (such as 
joumalism, graphic arts, social 
welfare , business administration 
as well as political science) are 
encouraged to apply for Lobby 
internships. Interested students 
can also define their own areas 
of interest and make proposals 
to the Lobby for special 
internship projects. 

Interested students can phone 
the U.c. Student Lobby for more 
detailed information. Students 
can also stop by their on-campus 
Lobby Annex Office for 
information on campus-level 
internship possibilities. The U.c. 
Student Lobby is located at 926 J 
Street, Suite 616, Sacramento. 
The number is (916) 442-3827.

Bottle bill 
• compromIse 

By MARlKO TAKAYASU, Sacramento COrTIspondenl 
SACRAMENTO - After 20 

years of intense conflict over a 
mandatory-deposit law on 
beverage containers, the state's 
beverage industry and 
environmentalists have reached a 
tentative agreement which one 
legislator caned "a major step 
toward recycling, conserving 
resources and cleaning up the 
environment." 

At a capitol press conference, 
a number of legislators and 
members of the beverage 
industry and enviromental 
groups announced that a 
compromise has been made 
between a mandatory five-cent 
bottle deposit and the current 
voluntary system of recycling. 

The beverage industry and 
labor groups strongly opposed 
the former, while 
environmentalists have found the 
Ialler unpalatable. 

The compromise legislation, by 
Assemblyrnember Ben Margolin, 
D-Los Angeles, would place a 
minimum value on aluminum, 
glass and plastic soft drink and 
beer containers sold after Jan. 1. 
1987. 

Under the proposed 
legislation, cons'lmers would pay 
a one-cent depOSit when 
purchasing a container. 
Consumers who return the 
beverage containers to a 
recycling center will receive their 
money back. 

Depending on market factors, 
recycling centers may offer 
additional money from the 
market value of the scrap 
materials. 

"Under the proposal, 
consumers would receive a 
bonus redemption value from 
containers that have not been 
returned to the system," Margolin 
said . 

The bill would also set up a 
state-re~laled recycling

commission which would 
analyze recycling rates, and 
collect and distribute the nearly

the program is expected to 
generate. 

After Dec. 31,1990, containers 
that were recycled less than 65 
percent of the time wouk.l bear a 
two-cent deposit. 

"This consumer 1'eC)'Cling

Supporters of the measure, 
including the 40,000 member-
Californians Against Waste, 
which also supponed past 
mandatory deposit legisladon, 
say the new bill is ~. creative. 
innovative experiment" similar to 
programs of other stateS. 

~We are aU optimistic that the 
new legislation - which calls for 
a goal of at least an 80 percent 
recycling rate for beverage 
containers sold in California -
will achieve results similar to 
those states that have enacted 
depOsit laws," said CAW 
Executive Director Bill 
Shireman. Ten States have 
similar laws, including Oregon 
and Vermont. 

Sen. Rebecca Morgan, R-Los 
AltoS Hills, principal co-author of 
the bill and author of past 
similar legislation said she 
thought the measure would be "a 
major step towards recycling, 
conserving resources and 
cleaning up the environment. 

"The state of my birth ... 
Vermont, has shown me the 
bonle bill works," she said. 
Vermont has had a bottle bill for 
over 13 years, and"the hillsides 
are clean, the roadsides are clean 
and the pastures are clean. I feel 
very strongly that his bottle bill 
will go a long way in cleaning up 
California," Morgan said.

Student accused of lynching 
By MONTE ROSEN, Slaff Writer 

RUSSELL ANDALCIO, UCSD student and a vocal member of the coalition 
for a free South Africa, at a 
meeting Tuesday, informed forty 
students, faculty and community 
members of accusations brought 
against him by the office of the 
sludent conduct coordinator. 

Anclalcio received a letter 
Monday from Beverly Varga , 
dean of Third College. The lcuer 
lists the three violations of the 
UCSD conduct code, and a 
violation of the California penal 
code against lynchings. 

In the letter, Varga states, "On 
January 23, 1986 you (Andalcio) 
were accused of the following 
violations: lynching, prompting 
others to assault university police 
officers, threats of violence or 
conduct that threatens the health 
or safety of any person on 
university property, panicipatlon 
in a disturbance of the peace on 
univerSity property, and failure to 
comply with directions of a 
university official in the 
performance of their duty." 

Chief of UCSD Police John 
Anderson said, 'The officers felt 
that, at the time, the emotions 
were high , there were toO many 
people and the incident was too 
unclear to make an arrest at the 
scene. Since there were more 
demonstrators than police, the . 
situation would have been 
exacerbated by any 
confrontation ." 

The incident occured on Jan. 
23 and took place on the hump 

directly following Bishop 
Desmond Tutu's speech at the 
main gym. 

The police repon, filed four 
hours after the incident occured, 
states, "A small fight broke out 
on the lawn in front of the main 
gym. Three or four people 
appeared to be struggling with a 
large banner on a long pole . 
Officer Ken Hill headed towards 
rwo or three guys who seemed to 
be pulling and swinging at each 
other. The three males were 
pretty much eparated when 
Officer HIll grabbed one of them. 
and some people from the crowd 
seemed to grab the others. We 
believed that the male with 
Officer Hill had instigated or 
possibly aggravated the fight. The 
white, blue-eyed, blond-haired 
male was cooperative and began 
walking away with us. 

"A large, angry black male , 
identified as Russell Adalcio 
(sic), stepped into our pathway 
and began shouting at us to let 
the male go because he was not 
the one who had staned the 
fight. He yelled to the crowd, get 
them. The black male was 
carrying a small male child (who 
appeared to be his son). The 
male had been identified to us 
earlier when he was vernally 
leading the rally as Russell 
Adalcio. 

"Adalcio continued to block 
our pathway out of the crowd 
and began yelling OUt, let him go, 
let him go! They began 
encircling our small group of 

offi ers and pressing against us. 
this would not allow us to move 
from the center of the crowd. 
Sgl. Isley g~ve us the word to let 
the male go since the fight was 
calmed , and we were in a very 
uncomfortable position. We lel 
the male walk away .... ft 

Anderson said, "The officers 
released him because in this 
instance discretion was the 
better pan of valor." 

"When police commit an 
injustice against a particular 
class, for example, slUdents, it is 
fascism and must be confronted 
immediately, not after it becomes 
a system of government which 
we must fight a war to end," 
Andalcio said .

witnesses of the incident,

State budget liDlits UC 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU 

SACRAMENTO - Governor 
George Deukrnejian's proposed 
1986-87 state budget does not 
provide the University of 
California with enough funds to 
cover COSts of staff merit salary 
increases, operating expenses 
and new equipment, according 
to the legislature'S non-partisan 
budget analysl. 

legislative Analyst William 

Hamm told the Senate Budget 
and Fiscal Review Committf'f' 
that the governor's proposed 
budget "needs a lot of work," 
including the UC ponion of 19 
the $36.7 billion budget 
bill . 

DeukmejTan proposed $3.5 
billion in state funds for UC, 
which includes $1.8 billion for 
its operating budget, an 8.8 

percent increase from the current 
fiscal year. 

"The administration proposes 
to hold down expenditures by 
forCing departments to absorb 
the cost of merit salary 
adjustments, as well as higher 
operating costs that are 
attributable to rising prices," 
Hamm said.

Sexual responsibility 
ovenakes 'free love' 

As the dust setdes and our wounded are cared for we search 
for the victor of the sexual revolution. It's been raging for two 
decades, tearing down the sexual roles and mores that have 
stood strong for centuries, and erected in their place the 
responsibilities of sexual freedom . One lesson our baby-
boomed brothers and sisters have taught us is to "be careful." 
We've been left to make our own sexual decisions, accepting 
both pleasures and consequences that accompany them. 
T oday's generation is more sexually aware - and herpes, 
AIDS, unwanted pregnancy and abonion ,are graphic 
reminders of how even our most sincere love or innocent 
relationships can go awry. 

College gives many of us the first opportunity to explore our 
sexual selves, a time to establish our own mores, gaining and 
suffering from our trials. The risks of intercourse have evolved 
with its inhibitions, breeding a more cautious generation of 
sexually active adults. We are no longer in high school and 
must realize that ideals of love, virginity, promiscuity, 
homosexuality and the like cannot be judged as 'right' or 
'wrong.' We have attained the freedom of choice and must 
respect the decisions of others just as we ask them to do of 
ourselves. 

In this post revolutionary period women are not, and should 
not be, taking the brunt of sexual responsibility. It is the 
consistent failure of the males of this generation to assume 
their mutual responsibility for the sharp increase in the 
number of single mothers in this COUntry. Pregnancy is a fact 
of life shared by both sexes. Creating a human life cannot be 
taken lighdy. No one wants to be an unwanted child. 

Birth control, for men and women, is readily available. If 
you choose to be sexually active you owe it to yourself, your 
panner and the rest of society to take precautions. The 
passionate moment has a direct link to conception , and it 
makes no sense to let your momentary desires take control of 
your common sense. 

It's refreshing to see the cruel stereotype of the meek and 
frail female disappearing and being replaced with a stronger 
and more truthful image of women in control of their lives and 
sexual relationships. 

Cohabitation (living with someone) has become a more 
popular and more accepted arrangement in relationships in 
the last ten years. With the nation 's divorce rate reaching 
epidemic proportions it is obvious that couples may want to 
test the waters before jumping into the lake, and as students, 
still in our relative youth , making life-long commitments in a 
time when our lives are changing so rapidly, can be done with 
the strongest intentions, but have the weakest results.

"Fra-;;dl Fraud? Wt don't want to talk about rraudl" 

Philippine elections 
After sixteen years of being subjected to a tyrant's whim, the electoral process finally 

reappeared sixty days ago in the Philippine Islands, to the apparent joy of some 
tWenty-four million citizens who turned out to vote. Being that there are twenty-six 
million Filipinos who are eligible to vote , this percentage of panicipants strongly 
indicates that what is at stake in the Philippines is more than campaign platforms. 
Hanging in the balance is a promise by the present dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos that 
this election would be fair, and that he would step down if challenger Cory Aquino 
garnered more votes than he did. Promises, though, have never meant much to Marcos 
or the members of his KB.L. party - especially if their continuity of power was 
threatened . The snap election, which was called by Marcos at the behest of the Reagan 
Administration (who are clearly wonied that a people's insur~ency led by New People's 
Army might tOpple the Marcos regime and kick the United States off Subic Bay Naval 
Base and Clark Air Base) was never meant to be more than a western pu_blicity ~tun~ 
for Marcos. In fact, Marcos announced the election on ABC-tv. What he did not count 
on was that thousands of Filipinos were ready and willing to defend their votes against 
fraud . Since election day last Friday, private citizens and Aquino party members have 
spent night after night at some 90,000 polling places, trying to legitimate their political 
power. Amidst heavy levels of violence and intimidation, ballot-box stealing, vote 
buying, and public pronouncements by Marcos that he "already won," the supporters of 
Mrs. Aquino held fast. Nearly the entire Filipino nation has cried fraud ; even a US 
obsetver team led by conservative senator Richard Lugar agreed that the electoral count 
"is being shaped to fit the President's needs." Undoubtedly, Marcos will order I\is 
K.B.L. dominated Parliament to declare him the winner in a few days; leaving Ml:$. 
Aquino and her supporters to fight for democracy in the streets. 

Not surprisingly, the only world leader who has seen any poSitive factors coming 
from Marcos' desperate attempt to hold on to power is President Reagan, who has 
viewed the electoral sham as "an exhibition of democracy." From where we are 
standing, it seems as if democratic pledges are sounding more and more like dirty 
clich~s . 

Religious cults creep onto campus 
By MARY WEBB 

ALTHOUGH MY brother had been a follower of Guru Maharaj Ji for 
years, my first introduction to a 
cult in action occurred in 1975. 
In the middle of a celebration of 
Cecil Williams at Glide Memorial 
Church, the doors burst open 
and hundreds of people -
mostly women - rushed down 
the aisles. They crammed 
themselves into the pews beside 
us as if we weren 't [here . They 
were followed by a white man 
with four black bodyguards 
complete with artache cases. 

'30s when Hitler spoke. 
But cult leaders do not always 

present themselves as 
dramatically as Jim Jones did 
that day. In fact , the leaders 
often remain in the background 
and it is the 10Uowers that you 
see - chanting, selling flowers 
on the streets, offering free meals 
on campus. The leaders are 
insidious and low-key. 

utopia (Bhagwan Rajneesh , 
Bubba Free John) social projects 
Oim Jones) or at the very least, 
the opportunity to bring in new 
recruits (the Unification 
Church). 

But how do you define a cult? 
According to psychologist Philip 
Cushman, a cult is a group of 
people coming together under 
the leadership of one person 
who considers him/ herself to 
have the divine aspects of a god. 
It is a group of people with a set 
of internal, inflexible "laws" 
which must be obeyed by all 
members, their labor as well as 
their worldly goods, are at the 
service of the leader at all times. 

tend towards separatism. Not 
only do a cult's "laws" takf 
precedence over social mores. its 
members venture into larger 
society only to reform it, 
denounce it or to snatch 
potential convens. 

Encircled by as many 
bodyguards as Huey Newton or 
Stokely Carmichael used to have 
in the '60s, he introduced 
himself from the podium as Jim 
Jones. His followers shrieked in 
response at utterly inappropriate 
times, in the middle of 
sentences. I knew that it must 
have been like this in the late 

The moonies have a term for 
pOtential converts. They call 
them "prepared people," of 
which they feel there are many 
on a college campus. A "prepared 
person" is someone who is just a 
little disoriented, a little lost, 
more [han usually vulnerable. For 
exzmple, students who feel 
overwhelmed by the size and 
impersonality of a large 
univerSity might join a cult for 
shelter, for a sense of community 
or a sense of social purpose . 

Most cults offer the promise of 

It is ofte n di ITicult to get out of 
a cult, and there is a clear 
dividing line between those who 
are "in" and those who are "out." 
There are no visitors, only 
potential inductees. 

While conventional religions 
have always applied social 
pressure to keep members in 
line, cults try to eliminate 
individual autonomy completely. 
Conventional religions seek the 
sanction of SOCiety, while cults 

But how does a cult member 
move in on an unsuspecting 
"prepared person?" The 
approach is gradual and involves 
deception . The moonies, for 
example, invite the person to a 
free dinner without identifying 
themselves. This invitation is the 
first step - innocent enough 
and appealing if you're shon on 
cash. 

The next step is a weekend 
carefully designed to make 
pOtential i nduLtees feel pan of a 
warm, loving community. Cults 
have very carefully designed 
induction rituals which are often 

di~uised . As far as I know, only

Some observations of life in the Philippines 
By BERNARD YIN 

The story from the Philippines 
looks larger from the air, 
especially from the air inside the 
continental United States. Here , 
the news media varies its stories 
day to day, in an attemrt to 
inform its readership 0 the facts . 
The facts, which could 
potentially affect the outcome of 
the Snap Elections, have proven 
to be slippery characters. 

concerns there. Maybe we better 
not know how nice it can be , or 
everyone would vacation there 
and live like presidents. 

As for presidents, the people I 
met are tired of the routines of 
political oppression, the shiftv 
management of funds, domestic 
industry monopolies of sugar 
cane and coconuts to name a 
few; and ti red of the sweet talk 
rhetoric from a highly dictatorial 

democracy. There is ample 
evidence of dissatisfaction with 
Marcos, from everpresent yellow 
Cory Aquino campaign posters, 
to radical newspapers supporting 
the New People's Army (NPA). 
Political divergence is in full 
operation in the Phillipines. 

One bomb that is exploding 
here is the population bomb. A 
loose estimate and direct 
observation places 50 percent of 

the population below 30. With 
this large youth constituency, 
either Marcos or Aquino will 
have to face the burgeoning 
questions of employment, 
education and social services for 
years to come. With the 
economy shaken by a declining 
gross national product and per 
capita income at 1972 levels, a 
40 percent underemployment of 
the COUntry's 21 milhon-member 

work force , and lastly a $26 
billion foreign debt, the winner 
of the election will head a 
country in the throes of poveny. 
As the Filipino peso devaluates, 
foreign currencies become even 
more powerful. 

One hears much rhetoric from 
the politicians in the media: 
engulfing the topics of the. US 
military bases, of the growmg 
and ever-threatening communist 
insurgency, and of the 
questionable fairness ballot 
counting. In fact, as of this 
writing, three full days following 
the elections there , no winner 
has been officially declared. But 
this fact is of little help in 
forming an opinion, or in 
developing a perspective on the 
realiry which is the Philippines. 

MGA MINAMAHAL KONG KABABAYAN 
HINDI KAYO NAG-liSA 

An interesting speculation was 
shared with me, which asked 
whether or not the foreign mass 
media scared away investment 
here and encouraged wealthy 
Filipinos to invest outside the 
country - interesting, because 
of the fact that Marcos is living 
openly like a king and has 
gargantuan foreign investments 
in the United States, which may 
or may not be from embezzled 
treasury monies or even from 
U.S. aid monies. Regardless of 
the source of his wealth , Imelda 
Marcos, his wife , has her own 
chain of department stores. 

Most people tum to their 
favorite medium when 
confronted with the question: 
"What is really happening in the 
Philippines?'" However, what 
most people fail to realize is that 
the personage of Ferdinand 
Marcos and the search for a 
coherent understanding of the 
Philippines is simply buried 
under issue after issue - lost in 
a maze of information. 

Really what is happening in 
the Philippines cannOt be 
caprured by a single story or in a 
single visit. In fact, after reading 
numerous journals from the 
islands , digging into over 20 
pages of references and then 
into the anicles themselves, 
looking for any coherent analysis 
of Marcos and the Philippines, 
the first-hand accounts were 
what offered the most satisfying 
facts . Aided by a Filipino family 
established on the islands and 
my own Southern California 
perspective, my winter break 
tumed into a college srudent's 
fact-finding adventure. 

The country is rich in 
resources of many types. From 
agriculture to tourism , it is filled 
with friendly people. The food 
was fantastic , the scuba diving 
world-class and the scenerey 
hypertropical. Perhaps this is the 
secret of the United States'

The horror stones of

For example , it was told to me

funds to provide an outlet for 
artistic expression , was 
sometimes used as a generic

but clearly profit motivated . The 
fact is, the Philippines is the 
place where scams abound , 
where entrepreneurs find 
paradise with low labor COStS

The U.S. Navy employs 4,500 
Filipino techniCIans to overhaul 
the ships of the seve nth fleet. 
The workers earn a typIcal wage 
of $1.80 and hour, which is 
approximately one-seventh the 
amount of the average wage in 
the United States for the same 
work. John Deere is here in the

Cults on campus ... ObselVances 
Continued from page .. 
Bhagwan Rajneesh has 
conceded, apparendy without 
embarrassment, that there are 
contradictions between what he 
says and what he does. But 
deception is almost always pall 
and parcel of cult recruitment. 

Although a cult resembles a 
small totalitarian SOCiety, it 
satisfies the basic human need 
for certainty, for structure, for 
comunity, acceptance and 
friends. In some cults, even the 
need for a life partner is 
satisfied . Everything is taken care 
of. The price is simply your 
autonomy. 

It seems unlikely that students 
at a university would be willing 
to relinquish their autonomy. But 
as Cushman points out, the 
person in the United States most 
likely to join a cult is 18-24 years 
old , white and from a middle- to 
upper-class background. The 
leisure to consider alternatives is 
another factor in the statistics. In 
addition, students are often 
idealistic, striving to create for 
themselves a philosophy of life . 
Cults offer one readymade. 

By and large , the educational 
system in this country 
emphasizes memory work and 
regurgitation rather than critical 
thinking. The average first-year-
student has done relatively litde 
thinking independent of family, 
schooling and religion. 
Hopefully, college encourages 
and sometimes teaches critical 
thinkIng, but for some it is toO 
late. 

Many students come to college 

with rigid value systems from 
home. In joining a cult, they 
might feel as if they are rebelling 
but in reality, they are only 
replacing one rigid system with 
another. Others come to college 
with no value system at all , thei r 
parents having substitute0 
materialism for a system of 
ethics. These s[Udents are ripe 
and hungry. They may want a 
group identity more extreme 
than that offered by fraternities 
and sororities. 

In a 1984 study by Arlene 
Noble, patterns of loss were 
found among many cult 
members: parental deaths , 
divorces, broken friendships and 
love affairs. Any of these can 

"prepare" a person to join a cult 
and it is dangerous to assume 
that only "weak minded" people 
are vulnerable to conversion. 

Rece nt estimates indicate that 
there are between 2,000 and 
3,000 cults in the United States. 
Although small, many are 
growing, and the largest claim up 
to 100,000 adherents. 

Many groups such as "Sorting 
it Out" by Susan ROlhbaum and 
Joshua Baran help ex-cult 
members re-enter society. But I 
think the key to limiting the 
spread of cults lies in prevention 
through education, through 
critical thinking. Parents must 
learn to expect independent 
thinking from their children . 
They must learn respect for the 
words and thoughts of their 
children. There is no reason for 
every university not to offer 
courses analyzing the rhetoric of 
god-hustlers and other idea 
merchants. 

The adjustments that lie ahead 
for ex-cult members are slow and 
difficult. But more painful still 
are the lives of parents who have 
not seen or heard from their 
children in five or six years. 
Some have attempted to kidnap 
their children and failed . Others 
inhabit a kind of limbo similar to 
that of relatives of people 
"missing in action." Anyone who 
has seen their faces would 
realize how urgent it is that we 
educate people about cults.

God-Hustlers. This article was

speak. The fact of the matter is 
that these islands clearly 
constitute a colony; thei r 
strategiC importance is secondary 
to their economic importance . 
But commodity producing 
companies are not alone in their 
exploitation of this Pacific 
paradise, 

Entertainment is a huge 
business here. Preying on a 
country that has a great love for 
all music, is the international 
pop music industry. This 
Godzilla allowed me to dance to 
Twisted Sister in a Manila disco, 
and also to hear four blind 
guitarists sing Neil Young songs 
on the island of Cebu. Western 
pop is everywhere and has been 
for c'~cades . However, many of 
these entenainment forms and 
their transmitting media are 
government monitored , if not 
outrighdy government owned . 

Most of the print media is 
under Marcos' weighty thumb , 
but alternative periodicals do 
exist. However, one becomes 
confused over who to believe. 
Facts are even more slippery 
here than in the United States. 
In the media here, facts are a 
dynamic fonn passing from 
paper to paper, given different 
ideological colors - but true 
facts cannot hide from seeing 
eyes. 

Prostitution abounds around

53,200 Filipinos with work. One 
sailor I met , who was on leave, 
described his set-up . For $200 a 
month , he rented a five room 
house with a view of the bay, 
and a live-in "wife" to cook, 
clean and provide for his baser 
needs. Likewise, the Japanese 
company men, longing for a cure 
to civilization , come not to Club 
Med, but to the Philippines. 

Something that struck me in 
my activity, was how a 
hazardous proportion of the 
Philippines' reef environment 
has been dynamited by 
desperate fishermen, after a large 
catch the easy way. They used 
dumped American ammunition 
which lasted decades after World 
War II. It made me wonder how 
many fishermen caught more 
than JUSt fish, 

I saw first-hand just how U.S. 
Imperialism is not merely a 
cliche, but let us not forget the 
beaury of the Philippines and of 
the people in their stru~e for a 
better life . Regardless orthe 
outcome of the elections, Marcos 
will doubtfuUy allow Aquino to 
assume power. And in the words 
of the U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State, Paul Wolfowitz, the 
Philippines is heading toward 
"civil war on a massive scale" 
within three to five years, if the 
insurgency of the NPA continues 
to grow. From the facts I 
witnessed, three years is an 
outside estimation.

Revelle College Semi-Fonnal 
by Barbara W, Steams 

CELEBRATE!! That's not only the theme , but also 
the main idea behind the Revelle College Semi-
Formal, which will be held on Friday night, Feb. 28, 
from 9 p .m. to 1 a.m., at the brand new LaJolla Marriott 
hare!. 

Part of the cost will be subsidized by Revelle college 
funds , so the tickets are only $8 per person, which 
includes the Dj., hors d'oeuvres, and unlimited 
refreshments. The tickets went on sale last week, and 
can be purchased at the Revelle Provost's office, the 
UCSD box office, and on the Revelle Plaza. 

It's been a tradition to have a Revelle College Semi-
Formal for many years, but this year, due to the lack of 
a "special" place to hold it , Revelle was simply going to 
donate funds to the all-campus semi-formal to be held 
in April. However, when the opportunity arose to rent 
the brand new, beautifully decorated , elegant LaJoUa 
Marriott ballroom, Revelle college just couldn't refuse ... 
and the plans aU feU into place! 

Heading the semi-formal committee are RCC 
members Julie Nefkens and Sal Yeas. Both feel that the 
semi-formal will be a huge success, as Yeas comments, 
'The enthusiasm and energy surrounding the semi-
formal , coupled with the location of the new Marriart 
hotel, is bound to make the event a great success!" 

February 28 is rapidly approaching, so everyone is 
encouraged to hurry and purc hase thei r tickets and 
come "CELEBRATE" with Revelle!

DR. MILTON H. SAlERJR., professor of biology at UCSD has been named 
recipient of the Senior U.s. 
Scientist Award from the 
Humboldt Foundation of the 
Federal Republic of Germany. 

This award is given each year 
to American senior scientists 
who are recognized for their 
contributions in research and 
teaching. 

The award, which 
commemorates the 25th 
anniversary of the Marshall Plan , 
is designed to promote scientific 
cooperation between research 
institutions in Germany and the 
United States. 

Saier joined the faculty of 
UCSD in 1972. His current 
research is on the regulation of 
physiological processes in 
bacterial and animal cells. "We 
stUdy mechanisms of molecular 
transmembrane transport - how 

sugars get in and out' of cells -
and how these procesSes are 
regulated," Saier said. 

The Humboldt Foundation has 

"We study 
mechanisms of 
molecular trans-
membrane trans-
port - how sugar 
gets in and out of 
cells ... " 

- Saier 
a 

arranged for him to lecture 
throughout Europe and conduct 
research at the Uni~rsity of 
Freiberg. Working with German 
biologists, he plans to focus on a 
sugar transport system of a 
photosynthetic bacterium called 

Rhodopseudomas capsulata in 
order to explain the system's 
genetic and biochemical 
properties. 

"We should be able to 
determine the structures of the 
proteins and the mechanisms by 
which they function ," Saier said. 
He hopes his work eventually 
will lead to an understanding of 
the process by which enzyme 
systems evolved. 

"We think this enzyme system 
is related to the primordial 
system from which far more 
complex bacterial transport 
systems evolved. Consequently, 
these studies can help us 
understand the process by which 
complex, multifunctional systems 
came to exist in living cells," he 
said . 

Saier is the third faculty 
member of UCSD to receive the 
Humboldt award. Earlier 
recipients are Marcos Intaglieua, 
professor of bioengineering in 
the Department of Applied 
Mechanics and Engineering 
Sciences, in 1982, and Murray 
Goodman , professor of 
chemistry, in 1985. I'a 

Budget 
Continued from page 3 

However, Hamm said this was 
deceptive. State departments and 
agencies, including UC do not 
have the funds to absorb those . 
additional COSts, he said. 

• As a result, they will have to 
cut programs and activities in 
order lO free up the money 
needed for merit salary 
adjustments," Hamm said. UC 
staff merit salary adjustments for 
the upcoming I1scal year would 
amount to about $8 million. 
Merit increases for faculty are 
now included in the proposed 
budget. 

Hamm said the governor's 
budget does not identify what 

uni~rsity programs or activities 
would be affected by the budget 
when the 529 million is 
deducted from the university's 
budget. 

"I'm not sure that, at this 
point, the Department of 
Finance knows where the cuts 
will fall. These are not

insignificant amounts either," 
Hamm said . 

Under the governor's budget 
UC would receive an increase of 
$140.4 million for the next fiscal 
year which begins July 1, but 
"$29 million of. .. the ... 
increase ". will go lO fund the 
unbudgeted costs for merit salary 
adjustments and operating 
expenses and eqUipment," 
Hamm said. 

The projected inDation rate for 
the next fiscal year is 4.' 
percent, which means COsts of 
utilities, library materials and 
instructional supplies will go up 
and there is no-money allocated 
in the governor's budget to cover 
those costs, Hamm said. 

Gardner said he intends to 
work with Gov. Deukmejian and 
the legislature in the next several 
months "in an effort to resolve 
this problem." 

The governor's proposed 
budget will go through a six-
month process of negotiations 
between the Assembly and 
Senate, where it will then be sent 
off the governor for aprroval by 
June 30, the last day 0 the fiscal 
year.

The changing roles of the 'Courting Dance' 
By EVA C. WONG, Contnburing Features Editor 

GLANCING ACROSS the crowded lecture hall you see him. Your eyes meet, 
but instead of looking away 
quickly while an embarrassing 
blush covers your face , you smile 
at him because you reaDy like 
what you see. He smiles back. 
After lecture you approach him 
and Initiate a conver allon " 

This behavior on the part of 
the woman is pretty common 
these days, and IS prctty much a 
pan of what today's society calls 
the "women's movemem," 
a cording to Hugh Pates of 
Psychological Services. "It's a very 
positive movement in that 
women want to take more control 
in their own lives, as well as in 

active with men . Ten years ago, 
men were expected to do all the 
advancing in sexuality. but now 
there's a balance." Therc is now 
the idea of women bein!! able to 
make more choices about what 
kinds of relationships that they 
want , whether it be on a 
friendship level or sexual. 

According to Chns Oakley. a 
health educator at tudent Health 
ervice , "There seems to be a 

shift in thinking about whether 
or not to have sex. And there 
seems to be a lot of thought on 
the pan of the woman before she 
has sex, though there is no real 
data to support this concept." A 
shift in attitude could be that 
today, more women are 

"People are more discri-
minatory of who their 
partners are. " 
-Chris Oakley, student 

health center 

relationships." 
Generally when people are 

attracted to one another, they 
first fall into "lust." Usually, twO 
people feel strong physical 
arrraction towards each other, 
sometimes more on one part 
than the other; one of the two 
will do what is known as the 
"courting dance," by showing 
interest in the other person. The 
' courting dance" as Pates caDs it, 
ean be done simply by being 
attentive to the other's needs. 

In the past when men and 
women went out, the woman 
tended to feel that there was to 
be some SOrt of payback on her 
part, since the man paid for 
everything. Bur one of the main 
changes of sexual attitudes In the 
dating pattern is that women are 
feeling much more independent. 

Says Pa tes, "Women tend to 
want to be able to contribute 
economically, in terms of the 
dating activity , because women 
feel a cenain pressure when the 
guy pays for the dinner, the 
show, or whatever." 

Bur Pates continues, ·Women 
also have been a little more 
aggreSSive in becoming sexually 

considering the consequences of 
sex, be that pregnancy or 
sexually transmined diseases, 
than 10 to IS years ago. 

"UCSD is a very health 
conscious campus, and there is 
an awareness on the pan of 
women of a lot of information 
concerning the consequences of 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
Infertility rates have gone up 
incredibly, due to scarring, and 
women are fearful of this future 
consequence," says Oakley. 

In the past few years, Pates 
maintains "students are a little 
more conservative sexually. 
because there is a growing 
anxiety of venereal diseases, 
such as AIDS and Herpes." Both 
Oakley and Pates agree that there 
is now more discrimination and 
reluctance. to have casual sex 
than in the mid-70s , due to the 
anxiety ewer sexually transmitted 
dIseases more than anything 
else. 

"The number of sexually active 
students has not gone down ," 
according to Oakley, "but reople 
are more discriminatory 0 who 
their panners are ." The statistics 
compiled in recent years of 

sexually a tive college-aged 
students that both Oakley and 
Pates have seen , show that the 
amount of sexually ac tive 
studcms ranges from about 50 
percent to about 80 percem, 
depending on the survey and 
study. Oakley adds, "I don't 
believe there has been a survey 
done at UC D." 

The conscrvativc behavior of 
women and men to have fewer 
partners, has been referred to as 
the "new chastity" or a rebound 
from the widespread sexual 
arritudes of the '60s and 70s. 
According to Pates, "Generally. 
since there is less casual sex, it 
should mean there is more time 
to explore relationships." 

Pates continues, 'Sometimes 
Individuals take flight into 
relationships in order to have 
(sexual) experience, and 
sometimes they don't necessarily 
want sex, but they see that as 
being a way to hang on to a 
relationship. The need for 
relationships and wanting to be 
loved is very high . {king 
attached to one person gives 
securitY. Individuals especially 
those who are feeling the pressure 
of college, sometimes just want to 
be held, to be close to someone, or 
to have someone can up that is 
interestr.d in them. 

The outlook on being a virgin 
has changed in the past few 
years for both male and female 
students. According to a study 
done at Yale , "In the past, both 
males and females were upset 
about being virgins, but now the

trend 'has reversed and being 
'virginal' is okay as a result of the 
de mystification of sex." 

Oakley says that she might see 
a skewed population at the 
Women's Clinic, since most of 
the sexually involved students 
that she sees have generally been 
in relationships for over a time 
span of months or even years. 
She adds that recently, there also 
seems to be a greater existence 
of friendshps between males and 
females. 

Pates and Oakley view the 
concept of "saving yourself ror 
marriage" differently. Oakley 
believes that more women today 

were written out of intrigue to 
find out who had placed the ad . 
Many asked question on the 
lines of, "Who are you? What 

ind of person putS such an 

interesting and provocative ad II, 
the Reader?" 

"Vanessa" rece ived twO times 
more respondents than "Jeff," as 

are comfortable now in not 
having pre-marital sex for 
reasons such as an unwanted 
pregnancy interfering with a 
future career goal. not being in a 
relationship or violating religious 
beliefs. Pates believes that this 
concept isn't held as strongly as 
it was ten years ago. 

"Primarily my experiences 
from counseling is that almost all 
the couples that I work with 
have had intercourse before they 
get married," says Pates. 
Exceptions to the rule are 
individuals who have a very 
strong religious background. 

"For instance," Pates gives as 
an example, "I have a couple in 
couseling who are both 
Mormons, and were very strong 
in terms of not having sex before 
marriage . When they got 
married , the man was not able to 
have an erection . They suffered a 
great deal by not having the 
experience of intercourse before 
marriage." 

The context of sex varies 
according to Pates, "I would say 
sex is probably seen among our 
students more as an opponunity 
of exploration than a recreational 
sexual contact." But generally, 
students are earnest about sex 
and relationships. Pates 
continues, "I think that 
individuals would very much like 
to be in love ; being in love is 
probably one of the most 
important and happiest 
experiences one can have." ~

video dating service, but 
otherwise , respondents to both 
ads seemed genuinely sincere 
about wanting to meet someor".::.

ad placed, then an analysis of 
the person who placed the ad is 
done by the respondent, and 
finaDy the letter is ended with a 
description of the writer in order 
to interest the initial ad-placer. 
The lengths of the letters ranged 
from one line to four pages. 
Women usually sent scented 
cards with flowery replies, and 
the letters from men range from 
being on scraps of tom paper to 
expensive stationary. 

Though the contents of most 
letters showed that romance was 
not dead, it seemed that basically 
most of the people responding 
were lonely. Most letters 
contained the phrase, "maybe 

you're lonely." Such interest in 
loneliness could indicate that the 
respondent is also lonely. 

According to Hugh Pates of 
Psychological Services, "the 
nOlion of personals ads are 
seemingly used by people in 
their late 20s to 30s. Most of the 
people who reply are people of 
post-college age, whose meeting

I 

Swimmers overcome assorted 
ills, still in top five 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, COlltributing Sports Editor 

I T WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT going [0 be a nonnal practice session. Bill Morgan tried to 
address the members of his 
swim team, but he was 
interrupted by a symphony of 
coughs, sniffles and wheezes. 

"Those of you who are still a 
little sick, try and get plenty of 
rest," said a concerned Morgan 
[0 the myriad of swimmers 
bobbing in the Canyonview poll. 

Sickness has ravaged the 
UCSD swim team, especially the 
women's team - various 
maladies such as pneumonia, flu 
and chest infections wiped out 
seven top swimers for the dual 
meet against Claremont and 
Pomona-Pitzer last weekend . 

"Getting sick really set us 
dov.rn," said Morgan about the 
women's team, considered to be 
one of the [Op three teams In 
Division Ill. "We were basically 
swimming with our second string 
and the girls stili performed well . 
This shows the depth of our 
squad." 

Morgan, though , had [0 deal 
with the sagging spirits of the 
women's team. "I'm, gomg to 
have a meeting with the girls to 
tell them that, despite the 
adversities we've faced due to 
illness, we're still a strong team 
and we'll do real well." 

Is the women's team strong 
enough to win the national 
championship? Morgan thinks 
they have a decent shot. "If we 
stay healthy, we'll be right in the 
thick of it." 

The men's team, although not 
as strong as the women's team , 
still is one of the top five teams 
in the nation in DiVIsion Ill. The 
Tntons did lose to C1aremont-
Mudd , considered by many 
coaches as the tOP team in the 

country, but UCSD is still a 
major contender for thr na tional 
championship. 

"We're capable of putting 
some top notch people in the 
pool: said Morgan, "but our one 
weakness may be in depth . We 
have a lot of potential depth 
because there are some good 
young swimmers in the program. 
Up front , though, we have some 
real big guns." 

Sickness had held one of 
Morgan's big guns captive as 
Roger Brisbane, the 1985 200 
flystroke national champion, was 
sidelined with the flu and unable 
to compete in the dual meet with 
Claremont and Pomona Pitzer. 
An admirable performance, 
however, was attained by Butch 
Cramer, as he qualified for the 
Nationals in the 200 freestyle. 

The swim team gets to cravel 
out of state for the second time 
this month to Moscow, Idaho for 
the Pacific West ChampIOnships , 
Feb. 20-22. 

UCSD does not employ full-
time coaches, al though some 
coaches feel going more to full-
time wtll help stengthen the 
UCSD athletic program. Morgan 
is a proponent 'of Tull-time 
coaches, and with the kind of 
schedule he's keeping, it 
wouldn't be such a bad idea. 

Morgan , as pan-time coach, 
also works as aquatic director of 
the Canyonvlew facility. If you 
add up the two-pracuces-a-day 
schedule and the other duties 
that Involve being a coach, 
Morgan easily putS in 12-14 hoUl 
days. And this twO-Job mnerary 
does not help Morgan's yearn [0 
strengthen the swim program. 

"You really can't expect any 
athletic program to improve

Califano was on the losing end 
of last Friday's second game, as 
the TrilOns fell meekly to 
Claremont Mudd 2-0 after 
hammering the Stags 10-2 in the 
first game behind Mark Sloan. It 
marked the second time within a 
week that Califano had pitched 
well enough 10 win but hadn't. A 
week earlier the senior from San 
Pedro lost to Christ College 1-0. 
A week earlier Sloan had opened 
the double-header and received 
11 runs. 

"It's nothing you can really 
explain," Yates said, "we just 
seem to come out with a lot 
more confidence when Sloan is 
on the mound. I do think that 
after blowing OUt the other side 
in both those games we came 
out a little flat. When we start to 
press we discover we're down by 
the first few innings." 

Against Claremont, the Tritons 
exploded for 11 runs in the first 
game, with Dan DiMascio and 
Bob Natal each going 3-4. 
DiMascio hit twO round-trippers 
and knocked in SIX runs, and

went five innings before relievers

"I wanted to give the relievers

thiS early in the season we 're

The second game was termed 
an "embarrassment" by Yates. 
"We gave up twO unearned runs

A CCORDING TO women's basketball coac h Jud y Malone, the Tritons 
played their game against Cal 
Lutheran last Saturday as though 
they "were somewhere else : 
which is unfonunate , because 
they were supposed to be at 
home, where they lost 68-56. 

"They (Cal Lutheran) are a 
good team, but we played very 
badly. We had tOO many 
tumovers," said Malone. Lutheran 
has dual membership in NAIA 
and NCAA Division II, and has 
beaten most of the top Division 
III teams. They dominated play 
against the Tritons, shooting 47 
percent to the Tritons' 31 
percent. 

The loss of point-guard 
Shanda Elzy didn't help the 
Triton cause any, as off-guard 
Sandy Keaton was forced to 
assume the position and 
committed six turnovers. 
"Shanda runs the offense , and 
right now without her we have 
trouble running the offense." 
Elzy, who injured her ankle, 
could be back by the next Tri ton 
game. 

Malone si ngled out Jennifer 
Gregory for her performance 
against Lutheran, as she tied 
with center Heidi Jungling for 
top scoring honors with 12 
points. Despite out-rebounding 
the opposi tion by eight ( 44-36), 
the Tritons' cold shoollng killed 
them. "Our offe nsive production 
was poor, but we're having 
difficulty because we haven't 
been consistent all year," Malone 
said. "We are inconsistent from 
quarter to quaner, and haven't 
been able to put together two 
good games back to back this 
year." 

The Lutheran game was 
evidence of this trait , because 
the night before at Azusa the 

Tritons were blown out by 24. 
Azusa - 21-4 - outclassed 

UCSD in every category, . 
shooting 50 percent from the 
field to the Tritons' J8 percent, 
and 81 percent to the Tritons' 48 
percent. "If we could have made 
some free throws, we might have 
had a fighting chance," said 
Malone. 

The taller Azusa team 
dominated play inside , especially 
6'0" Cindy DeYoung, who scored 
27 points to lead all scorers. "We 
put three players on her and she 
still cOl,lldn't be stopped ," Malone 
said , "but we did manage to hold 
another one of thei r top scorers 
(Denise Duncan) to five field 
goals ." Malone credited Sandy 
Keaton for her defense on 
Duncan. Keaton gave up five 
inches to the 5'10" Duncan. 

"We played well on defense , 
but our offense was poor," said 
Malone. 

The Tritons next take on 
Nonhem Arizona , a strong 
Division I learn . 'The Nonhern 
Arizona game is a scheduling 
jaux pas on my pan, said 
Malone , "They average about six 
inches more in height than our 
team. We'll try to hold them 
under a hundred ." 

Nonhem Arizona beat 
DiVision I USD by 30, so the 
TritOns arc raci ng the strongest 
opponent the)1 will face this yea r. 
"Hopefully it will bring out the 
best in us," Malone said . 

The Tritons travel to San 
Bernardmo on Saturday to 
ave nge an early season loss. 
Smce the TritOns arc not in any 
post-season play, Malone is 
looking forward to next year. 
"We're only losing two players," 
she said, "and If we can get 
some inSide help, we'll really be 
a forc,e next year." ~ 

East

West 

I T'S TIME TO TALK about some things that have gotten under my craw, a montage of 
thin~ about college basketball 
that don't make sense. I've 
procrastinated long enough, so 
here goes. 

First of all, the referees not 
having some kind of national 
association with a common set 
of rules, requirements and 
interpretations is archaic. There 
should be a centralized clearing 
bouse for officials, incolJ>onated 
as pan of the NCAA sturcture, for 
all collegiate spons. 

There would be a number of 
advantages, I think, if this 
national association would do 
some thmgs that have long been 
needed. 

Whenever possible, I feel 
referees should be assigned and 
scheduled as is most convenient, 
with an awareness by the 
national associa tion of thei r 
travel requirements and 
expenses. The ACC is currently 
thinking about going to full-time 
referees, which I think makes for 
an impossible situation, because 
any time an ACC team played 
outside the conlerence, they 
wouldn't be able 10 use the 
permanent refs, because the 
other guys would naturally think 
they would favor the ACe. 

Also , I feel the re should be a 
mandatory retirement 'age set for 
referees, perhaps somewhere 
between 60 and 65, and that 
each half of the new officials 
entering the collegiate ranks in 
all spons should be under 30 
years of age . This would 
maintain a freshness, a rotation, 
and would do away with the 
bride-wife sort of thing between 
some conferences and certain 
officials. That would do away 

with people saying, ·Oh no, nor 
so and so again ," because you 
wouldn't see the same faces 
every time you see a lZame. 

It 's gotten to the point now 
where recruiting is no contest. 
Vou have your 40 schools that 
have acheived star stalUre with 
the excessive exposure, who 
usually sign their high school 
players before the kid 's senior 
year stans in the fall . And then 
you have the also-rans, who fight 
for the crumbs in the spring, like 
desperate robi ns in the snow. 
There are a few exceptions, but 
not too many. 

The last thing I want to dwell 
on is the problem we currently 
have with West Coast basketball. 

First, it shold be noted that 
Coach Wooden was ahead of his 
time, his standard was 
impossible for anyonc to follow. 
But he's been gone now 10 years, 
and UCLA has its fifth coach in 
Walt Hazzard . 

The reasons, I believe, that the 
West coast is soft is because the 
East coast governs all the TV. 
The only team the other twO-
thirds of the country sees is 
UCLA, becuase of the time belt, 
because everything is set for the 
eastern market, to get exposure 
and not interfere with the 
eastem men's block. If a West 
coast team wants lV, they either 
have to play at 11 o'clock in the 
moming, or travel to the 
Midwest. 

What this all means is that the 
good high school players on the 
Pacific side don't see the West 
coast schools on' lV so it affects 
the recruiting. Already, two of the 
beSt players on the West coast ' 
- Steve Thompson of Los 
Angelcs and Earl Duncan of 
Santa Monica - have gone to

Syracuse. The best player -
Scott Williams of Hacienda 
Heights - has signed with 
North Carolina. De Paul has 
cherry-picked its kid , Kevin 
Holland of Cerritos, and Kansas 
has taken a thoroughbred in 
Keith Harris out of Santa Monica . 

Even Bobby Knight has left the 
Rust Belt and gone to Tony 
Bennett-land to get his kid - 6-
10 Dean Garrett. 

All this happens because lV 
exposure does much in 
creating the desires of a 17 -year-
old kid , because he pictures 
himself playing in the Carrier 
Dome, being Pearl , before 28,000 
people; or seeing the Sky Blue of 
Chapel Hill and Dean Smith; or 
feeling the excitement of the 
Second City, where the Channel 
9 superstation has done the 
recruiting for De Paul; or playing 
for Larry Brown, who may be the 
next US Olympic coach. 

A final factor is that weather 
in that part of the country is not 
conducive to basketball. There 
are too may surfboards, shon-
shons. The only time people stay 
indoors is when they get a 
rainstorm. And that there hasn't 
been a PAC-1O team in the Final 
Four in the last six or seven 
years. Also, they seem, out there, 
to have no character coaches, no 
l.eftys, no Lous, no Bobby's. They 
all are buttoned doWn, with their 
hair in place. . 

Thats why the only stars left 
on the West coast today are in 
Hollywood. 

Okay, that's il. I've got it all 
out of my system for a while, but 
when you think about it, it's 
almost as crazy, as insane, as not 
having a jump ball at the start of 
the second half. But that's 
another story.

Golfers 
destroy 
Whittier 
By DAVID TEDROW, StaffWnter 

W ITH THE ANDY Williams Tourney at Torrey Pines this 
weekend , the Tritons decided to 
take their show on the road, so 
they loaded up their clubs, and 
headed [or the links. Golf, that is 
- putting greens, water hazards. 

Their first StOP was the 
Friendly Hills Country Club on 
Friday where they met, played 
and destroyed Whittier College . 
The Tritons beat them by an 
average of over 10 strokes a 
man with Pat Weishan shoaung 
a 73. This made him low man 
for the Tritons as well as 
medaliSt for the match . Mike 
O'laughlin was next with a 75 
fo llowd by Kevin "Wildman" Lea, 
Barry Bariteau, Fritz Reber and 
Brad Sterling, all of whom easily 
defeated their respective cohort 
from hapless Whinier. 

On Monday, UCSD faced a 
much tougher opponent in Cal 
State University at San 
Bernardi no. CSUSB and 
Redlands are usually the toughest 
Division III oppone nts the 
Tritons face on the West Coast , 
but so [~r this year, it has not 
been much of a challenge. Coach 
Mike Wydra said, "San 
Bernardino's new golf coach is 
also their athletic director, so 
he's push ing the sport hard 
there. They've done some 
rec ruiting and have gotten one 
good player (Gary Osc hele), but 
they're still a year or two away." 
This became appare nt a t the end 
of the Tritons' match which had 
UCSD winning easily 401-426. 

Pat Weishan "has to 
be the faVOrite for the 
Individual National 
Championship. " 

-coach Wydra 
Pat W eishan was agai n the 

low man fo r the Tritons with a 
four over par 76. "Pat's playing 
very well right now," commented 
Wydra , "He h it one ball out of 
bound s and th ree-putted fo ur 
times and was s till able to shoot 
a 76. He has to be the favorite 
right now for the Indiv idual 
National C hampionship at the 
end of the year." 

Next for the Tritons was 
"Kevin" Lea with a six over par 
78. However, fi ve of those six 
shots over par came on one 
un fo rtunate hole with a lake on 
it. But please, don't mention the 
word "lake" around Mike 
O 'Laughhn who hi t three ba ll s 
into the lake on one hole, givi ng 
h im and eight-over-par 11 for 
the hole. "It was somethi ng you 
could not imagine ever 
happen ing to you or anyone else 
you know; you o nly read about 
those th ings in fantasy books," 
e xplained a bewildered 
O 'laughli n . 

So the Tritons finished thei r 
weekend trips minus a few ball s, 
but plus a couple of WinS Their 
next matches arc tomorrow and 
a week from tomorrow against 
the San Diego Golf Academy, 
and Lhen in the DGA 
Tournament Both of these 
events Will take place at 
Whlspenng P<1lms. 1GI

Specialty of the house 
by gita reddy 

In the world of movies, everything works out, right? If a bad guy is 
chasing you, you just whip out your handy-dandy, super-deluxe, 
futuristic thingamajig which will (of course) perfectly foil your dastardly 
chaser. Your non-descript duffle bag hides every good-guy-foils-bad-guy-
trick known to man, yet does not hamper your throwing arm even after 
being lugged around on your shoulder for hours at a time. Time does not 
cause you to be hungry, affect your wardrobe or mess up your hair. You 
are a good guy, a hard worker, aman, yes (but more than that) you are ... a 
Special Effects Technician. 

Yes, you are one of the talented people who were behind the illusions of 
Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghastbwters, Nightmare on ELm Street and any other 
movie that contained a space, blood and guts, car chase or equally pseudo-
realistic scene. These guys are the wizards of the cinema. They deserve 
praise and awards, but a movie about them? 

Hollywood seems to be short on ideas when they write scripts about 
themselves. They seem to be wondering out loud: could a special effects 
genius use his trickery knowledge in the real world? Gee, they decide, let's 
made a movie about it! 

Bryan Brown (The Thorn Birds, Breaker Morant) is Rollie Tyler, a famed 
fix (movie jargon for special effects) expert whom the government taps to 
assist them in a job for their Witness Relocation Program. Despite 
meticulous planning, all does not go as expected and Rollie is forced to 
run. Out of the movie world, fake blood mixes with real just as old plots 
mix with new, but through it all, Rollie Tyler stands tall and brave (despite 
no bed, kitchen, or shampoo). 

Our wronged hero's predicaments and solutions are often reminiscent 
of Robert Redford's government employee/ fugitive from the Feds in 
Three Days of the Condor. Brown's gimmick in FIX lies in the illusionary 
skills of his occupation while Redford's advantage was that he read books 
(everything published in the world) for the CIA. Redford's novel-learned, 
bad-guy-foiling techniques appeared more believable than Brown's movie 
magic, though, because the audience knows Brown's are just tricks or 
because FI X has more loose ends. 

Realism is not FI X's strong point, but it is an entertaining film. Brian 
Dennehy (O>eoon) plays a maverick cop who is determined to solve a 
murder despite his superiors blocking his way. Rosebud, one of Rollie's 
creations, is probably the most interesting character, even though he has 
no lines. 

Don't see FIX expecting to learn anything new about the movie 
industry. See it for instructions on how to fake an assassination and for 
what to bring in your duffle bag in case something goes wrong. Or just see 
it, but don't analyze it. As the saying goes, sometimes you just have to let 
art flow over you.

Scared of your closet? 
by ken furie 

Gary Larson is a shy guy. 
He wouldn't grant any 
interviews, not even over the 
phone, and he wouldn't let 
anyone take pictures of him. 

The very first words out of 
his mouth were "I'm scared to 
death." And he was - it was 
obvious. His voice was 
nervous; he paced around just 
a bit behind the podium, and 
he repeatedly needed the 
reinforcement of the glass of 

being a celebrity. And it is this 
very fact about him that 
makes him such a plellsure to 
have around. 

He shared some time with 
the audience. It was very 
informal. very casual, 
sometimes a bit awkward. 
Nothing else would have been 
so wonderful, because it is 
Larson's human aspect - his 
nervousness, his sinceri ty, 
his lack of a stylized delivery, 
his lack of confidence - that 

and opening the door very 
slowly so as to terrorize 
Larson. "I let out a primal 
scream, and my mother came 
running .... " 

I guess you had to be there, 
which is just about the way the 
strip itself operates. Larson is 
intrigued by the many phobias 
of mankind, and his strip is 
constantly reversing existing 
situations, so the readers see 
something that they take for 
granted in a different light. 

Larson has a personal joke 
running with everyone who 
reads his comic strip; they can 
understand the perspective 
Larson is offering, and they 
identify with Larson in 
thinking that this particular 
phobia or condition can really 
be silly, if you see it in a 
certain way. 

One of the most intriguing 
aspects of Larson's informal 
talk and slide presentation 

was the audience reaction to 
the slides. He showed some 
old favorites, in order to talk 
about aspects of them, or to 
tell an ant:cdott: which was 
involved in the conception or 
publication of the particular 
strip, and he showed some 
clips that had been rt:jected by 
the editors. 

It was very interesting to 
watch the audience as the 
strips were presentud . 
Different people laughed 
incredibly at particular ~trips ; 
everyone seemed to have their 
favorite, and no one seemed 
to have any particular favorite 
in common. This shows the 
wide appeal of Larson 's 
humor. 

Larson closed with a 
question and answer period. 
Someone asked him if he 
thought he would ever reach 
the point thar Garry Trudeau 
(Doonesbury) and Tim Downs 
(Downs town ) reached: both of 
these men reached a point 
where they needed to take a 
break from the strip because 
of the pressure and dedication 
involved in producing 

something funny every day 
for a long time. He answered 
yes, he sometimes worried 
about that. He didn't expect 
to be around for a very long 
time. He said, "This isn't the 
kind of thing that anyone 
should spend a lifetime 
doing." 

He said earlier, .. Every day I 
do another strip is one day 
longer than I thought I would 
be doing it. " He feels that 
something like humor cannot 
remain the same. "Humor is 
an evolutionary kind of 
thing . ., 

That is certainly true. 
Larson's own strip is evidence 
of the evolution of humor. He 
draws eartoons dealing with 
dt:ath, the end of the world in 
a nuclear holocaust, violence 
in society and violence in 
nature; he breaks taboos 
constantly. And in our 
modern, evolving world, he is 
very successful because of his 
un co nscious courage in 
approaching the "far side" of 
these grim topics and putting 
them on a It:vel that people 
can grasp and make fun of. 

In a new light 

"Aphldsl Aphids. HenryI ... AphidS are 100 .. In 
the gardenl" 

water he kept in the podium. 
So what was he doing in front 
of so many people in 
Mandeville Auditorium on 
Saturday night? I'm certain he 
was asking himself the same 
question, long before the 
crowd finally let him go. He 
shouldn't have worried. He 
was a great success. 

Larson is a man who seems 
to be harassed by his own 
success. Apparently, although 
The FaT Side, his comic strip, 
has been growing in 
popularity for a while, he has 
not accustomed himself to 

makes him so very charming 
and appealing. This man has a 
great, warm personality, and 
his nervousness was a lovely 
aspect of it. 

He began by telling the 
audience a bit about his 
approach to The Far Side, and 
how it had its roots in his 
family and childhood. "When 
I was a kid," he related, "I had 
this great fear of my closet. 
Everything scary I had ever 
imagined, I believed was in my 
closet." He talked about how 
his brother would scare him, 
one time hiding in his closet,

IN MATION A 

by mikel toomb. 
In order to fully appreciate 

the Bangles, it helps to meet 
them halfway . Now, 
"halfway" doesn't necessarily 
mean 1977, although the 
Bangles' timepiece seems 
permanently locked onto the 
late '60s - tellingly, their 
most prominent flashforward 
into the Naughty '80s, the 
frince-penned "Manic 
Monday," is only super-
ficially successful. 

No, its a rather aimless, 
standing-still quality to their 
music and career that makes 
the Bangles so potentially 
frustrating. On the one hand, 
the band's new album has a 
time-defying feel that, despite 
the obvious faraway reference 
points, makes it sound hardly 
dated; on the other, the 
record, for all its advanced 
musicianship and production 
subtleties, is no better 
(though certainly no worse) 
than the 1981 debut single,

"Getting out of Hand." 
However problematic, 

though, Di//erent Ughi is a 
highly enjoyable effort. 
Featuring fine lead vocals 
from all four members -
sadly, the best singer, 
drummer Debbi Peterson, is 
still criminally underem-
ployed - the record 
complements solid original 
compositions with Jules 
Shear's pretty "If She Knew 
What She Wants." Liam 

and subtle Bangles, but singer 
Susanna Hoffs doesn't have 
enough crude lewdness to pull 
it off. Guitarist Hoffs is more 
in her element on the quietly 
obsessive "Walking Down 
Your Street" - the Bangles' 
loudly obsessive songs, 
notably "Want You" and 
"Silent Treatment," are 
perhaps a thing of the past 
now - and "If She Knew 
What She Wants." 

Sternberg'S sophisticatedly Steele makes the most 
nonsensical "Walle Uke an distinctive vocal effort on the 
Egyptian" and Alex Chilton's acoustic-guitar-backed "Fol-
Big Star classic, "September lowing," a haunting tale of 
Gurls." (Curiously, the group (yes) quiet obsession, but the 
makes what seems a half- best songs belong to lead 
hearted attempt at "Gurls," guitarist Vicki Peterson.

Too close for comfort in the Rec Gym 
by john nee 

Last Saturday, the 
Untouchables played to a 
large and perhaps too 
enthusiastic crowd in the Rec 
Gym for a Dance~a~thon 
sponsored by the ZBT 
fraternity as a benefit for the 
American Red Cross. 
However, the seemingly 
altruistic good intentions of 
ZBT were clouded by the 
actions of its members who 
acted as bouncers during the 
course of the concert. 

by sue peters 
Eight bands, two stages, 

two radio station sponsors, a 
gym full of people and a good 
cause made up the dance~a~ 
thon last Saturday night. 
Funnily enough, the dancing 
itself was not the focus of the 
evening. 

At either end of the 
recreation gym two stages 
were set up - the one with the 
magnificent speakers was 
where the Untoucnables were 
to play later in the evening, 
and the other was where the 
U.E.O. stage (the University 
Events Office having taken 
part in the organization of the 
event) was placed. 

Throughout the night 
bands performed on alternate 
stages in a sort of band 
marathon. While one played, 
the other would set up, so as 
soon as the performance was 
finished, the audience could 
cross the floor and watch the 
following band begin its set. 
From this point of view alone, 
the organization of the event 
was quite a feat. Transporting 
eight bands' worth of 
equipment in and out of the 
one venue could have been 
chaotic, but with the help of 
stage managers and security 
guards no major incidents 
occurred. 

The Dance~a~thon started 
around 5 pm. During the next 
six hours, several bands 
played, some good and some 
bad, while an anxious crowd 
gathered waiting for the 
Untouchables to perform. 
Finally, the Untouchables hit 
the stage and the crowd 
pushed forward as the band 
went into their first song. The 
band had finished their third 
number "Wild Child" when 
one of the bouncers ran on 
stage and told the band to 
stop. For several minutes the 
band stood by and watched as 
a throng of red shirted 
bouncers impotently tried to 
move the crowd away from 
the stage. The band finally 
began to perform again, but 
was interrupted two other 
times during the show by 
members of the fraternity 
who felt that the situation, 
and the crowd, were getting 
too out of hand. By most 
standards, however, the 
Untouchables, and the people 
who like them are a very tame 
group. The problems that 
happened at last week's show 
were not caused by the crowd, 
but were, for the most part, 
created in the minds of those 
in charge of security at the 
event. Bouncers at concerts 
are generally disliked but they 
are there to perform specific 
duties which they are 
expected to carry out in a 
professional manner. This 
was not the case of the 
security at the Dance~a~thon. 

The ZBT bouncers get the best of the Untouchables crowd last SAturda, night. 

With a view to promote 
local amateur talent, seven 
bands from the San Diego area 
were selected to perform that 
evening in a "Battle of the 
Bands. " (Yet sound checks 
were obviously of greater 
importance to the groups than 
any kind of competition.) 
Starting at the U.E.O end 
were the Ducks, who were 
followed by Last Treaty, then 
Fiction, The Subterraneans, 
The Pinstripes, Generic Qand 
Borracho y Loco. 

Clearly, the members of 
ZBT overreacted to very 
normal circumstances and 
their actions served only to 
amplify any problems that 
existed. Commenting as the 
show was stopped for the first 

time, Greg Cometa, the 
Untouchables' road manager, 
said, "This is bullshit! This 
isn't that bad." 

A stage hand for the Dance~ 
a~thon said that nothing out of 
the ordinary happened at the 
concert and that the tendency 
for the audience to push 
forward was "normal crowd 
stuff." He went on to add that 
there were no barricades in 
front of the stage to keep the 
audience back. Having 
barricades would have 
alleviated most of the 
problem. 

The stage security incidents 
were not isolated to the 
Untouchables' performance. 
The two stages used during 

The home of the 

the event were to ensure a 
smooth transition between 
bands . Bouncers were 
stationed in front of both 
stages to keep the crowds 
back. Even on the smaller 
stage the security people were 
too zealous. Bernard Yin, 
guitarist from Limbo Slam, 
said, "There was a really 
healthy crowd of both on~ and 
off~campus people all 
interested in seeing all the 
bands and the Untouchables. 
I think the physical stage 
security was a little 
overplayed.' 

It is surprising that school 
officials allowed ZBT to do 
their own security for the 

Dance~a-thon. This was a 
show by a professional band

and there should have been 
professional security at the 
stage who have had experience 
dealing with crowds. "The 
bouncers were ZBTs and they 
were paranoid," said Todd 
Rippo, drummer for the 
Pinstripes. "They went a little 
overboard. If you're going to a 
concert you've got to expect 
that there will be a pit in front 
of the stage where people are 
dancing. It wasn't that bad, 
though. They were even 
pushing people away from the 
stage when Borracho Y Loco 
were playing." 

Despite the problems with 
the bouncers, the Untouch~ 
abies performed an impeccab~ 
Ie show. Their next record is 
due out inJune. 

The Untouchables were 
obviously a good drawcard -
even Channel 10 stopped by 
for a short interview. And the 
whole concept itself of giving 
local musicians an opportuni~ 
tv to perform for a large 
audience was very commend~ 
able. If nothing else, it was 
very interesting to see what 
shape and form talent is 
taking, and the amount of 
originality involved.

Power 
to the 
People 
by ken furie 

The best thing about Sidney 
Lumet's new film Power 
(playing citywide) is its 
timeliness. The age of media is 
upon us; we rely upon the 
media to keep us informed 
about world events both 
global and domestic. When 
Kennedy defeated Nixon and 
made him look so very tense 
and unsure in the first ever 
televised debate, it convinced 
campaign managers that the 
media could be the best 
weapon and defense of any 
candidate. Their 'look" is of 
ultimate importance. POWL'T 
gives us an unsettling look at 
the people who give our 
candidates their "look" and 
stirs up questions in the 
viewer's mind as to who holds 
the true power. 

The worst thing about 
Power is that it doesn't 
capitalize as well as it should 
upon its potential impact on 
the viewer at the level of the 
characters. There is no one the 
audience can really identify 
with . 

Certainly, it should be 
understood that a character 
study is not the main thrust of 
the film; they are making a 

statemen~ about the big 
business of political 
campaigns. 

It is a good film, but if 
Lumet and associates had 
somehow managed to rope 
the viewer in completely, if 
Pete St. Paul (played by 
Richard Gere) had been more 
vulnerable, the audience 
could identify with him more. 
This alone would have made 
the film great. 

Pete St. Paul's coldness is 
not Richard Gere's fault. For 
the first time, 1 found I really 
like Richard Gere in a role, 

. and 1 think it is because this is 
the first time he has been cast 
for his acting talent rather 
than his good looks. Yes, he 
looks good in this as well, but 
that is irrelevant to the plot, a 
first. 

Gere shows true promise as 
a charismatic actor. It was 
necessary for Peter St. Paul to 
dominate almost every scene 
in which he takes part, and 
Gere rises to the challenge 
with a very natural ease. 

The tone of the film is very 
well crafted. Pete St. Pete, 
zipping all over the world in 
his private jet, marches to the 
beat of his own drummer, 
spending his flights rapping 
away at a practice pad in 
perfect synchronization with 
the big brass bands. The music 
permeates the film, and gets 
into the viewers' spine, and 
the frenzied lifestyle of St. 
Paul can be verified in the 
clenched hands and tense 
necks of the audience. 

Overall, POWl.'T is to be 
highly recommended. The 
topical content and talented 
acting blends to make it a very 
good and important story.
