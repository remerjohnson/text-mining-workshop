Reopening RA process 
not the right answer 

The decision to reopen the application process for 
the Third College RA ha been the subject of an 
ongoing controversy. For the last few year the 
amount of minorities in the RA position ha been 
declining. In 1978 nearly half the RA were people of 
color. This year two of the twelve were. 

Dean Varga' intention is honorable: to preserve 
the ethnic balance of the school. Third College is 
depicted as a school where there are no real minorities 
or majorities. It would not be good policy if the RAs, 
people that are role models for new tudent, 
consi ted of all whites. 

However, this unbalance may be due to the process 
with which the RA were chosen. Of the 66 people 
that took application, , only 35 chose to appl y. Thi. 
could be due to the raising of the minimum grade 
point average requirement to2. 5, but thi " mayonl y be 
speculation. 

The hortening fo the notilication period might be 
another reason for the low turnout. Norm all y the 
' tudent organizations are given two weeks notice. to 
apply for the po ition. This year only four days notice 
was given, 

Perhaps it is the process that is killing the balance. 
If the people don't know, they can't act. M.aking. ure 
the word i out is half the process of selectIOn. With a 
bigger pool. it obviously would be easier to choose 
from it. 

But rechoosing doesn't eem to be the answer. 
Forcing the same 35 applicants on the selection 
committee is not the right way to achieve an ethnic 
balance. 

Dean Varga is right in trying to preserve the ethniC 
balance of Third College. Minority involvement is 
needed in a school that is depicted as non-majority. 
RAs are depended upon by new students for 
everything from a new light bulb to psychological 
counseling. Without a doubt, the job is an important 
one and should not be treated lightly. 

By reopening the process Dean Varga is only 
flogging a dead horse. She herself admitted that the 
process is fair and democratic and that the reason for 
the reopening is that she is unhappy with the results, 
Perhaps more attention shou ld be placed on why only 
half the applicants chose to be interviewed. 

In this case, the intention is honorable, but the 
method is chaos. Finding the right RAs will involve 
more than rechoosing until the right balance is 
achieved,

Wrong. Consum er smarts 
don't necessaril y s harpen 
from generat ion to generat ion. 
And . if our biggest ally 10 
Washington, the Federal 
Trade Commiss ion (FTC), is 
succes, fully strangled this 
year in Congress, some of us 
will be in for the rides of our 
lives. 

Since 1914, the pint'sized 
FTC has been charged with 
the awe ome respon ibilityof 
policing America's market -
place for "unfair" and 
"deceptive" business prac-
tices. Only recently, however, 
has the agency vigilantly 
defended the public interest . 
sendIng consistent signals fo 
advertisers and promoters 
thai Uncle Sam will tolerate 
nothing short of the straight-
and-narrow. 

As it came of age in the mid, 
1970s, t he FTC rid us of some 
of the downright flimflam ads 
we'd grown up with . Now, 
when in doubt. we know 

" bat lenes aren 't lI1c1uded." 
Lal erthi s month {Apnl 21 la 

House subcommittee will hold 
a second round of hearings on 
the much maligned agency's 
budget and aut horit y thai 
cou ld be the harbinger for a 
ret urn 10 t he days of t he 
con ... umer jungle. . 

In ani ir ipat ion. ~ h oppers

r~eaga n 's regulatory cza r. FTC 
chairman James Miller Ill , 
want s to dismantle I he agency 
he directs. And two teams of 
senators have responded with 
"wing'c1ipping" bills popular 
with business leaders ; a third 
bill is in the work . 

Chairman Miller, who i, not 
a lawyer . shocked fellow 
commissioners (as well as 
advertisers) at a enate 
hearing last month when he 
suggested that Congress limit 
t he agency's power to 
prosecute companies for 
"deceptive" acts or practice. 

In an interview with our 
associate, Michael Duffy, FTC 
commissioner Michael 
Pertschuk expla ined that 
Miller sees consumers on ly 
"as the lawyer , the bankers 
and the economists. And he 
thinks everybody else has 
plenty of time to shop 
carefu lIy." 

It was Pertschuk who, as 
chairman from 1977 through 
1980, guided the FTC through 
highly'controversiai probes of 
deceptive used car ~ales, 
unfair funeral service pricing, 
and the well-known Pat Boone· 
Acne Statin case. Despite 

publi c support for such 
investigal inn s. press ure from 
bus iness contribut or!oo ha s 
s ince soured Congress on the 
FTC. 

Yet , a ... Pert srhuk points 
oul , no genera t ion IS immune 
to I he ofl en u Il not ieeabh -
... {'durti n· advert is ing prac-
tIced In the US today. Like 9-
and I ()-vear-old s scru tlll izcd 
by behaviorists, baby·boomers 
understand the dubious merit 
of commercials, yet frequent Iy 
covet - and purchase - the 
product in question . 

"No matter how street ·wise 
people think they are, the 
evidence is overwhelming that 
they'll believe anything a 
salesperson says," laments 
Pertschuk. "And they get 
burned time and time again ." 

But before orne political 
charlatans sell us another 
bottle of budget cuts as a cure 
for "regulatory excess," it's 
worth pointing out that most 
Americans favor government 
intervention in the market-
place to keep advert isers 
honest. Young American 's 
poll s show, they want more 
information about products 
which regularly get them in 
trou ble: automobiles, credit 
cards and banking procedures. 

It makes no sense to turn 
back the clock of consumers. 
Despite wide pread support in 
the private sector, no one in 
the administration - of in 
Congress - has proven that 
unfair practices are. in any 
way, economically efficient.

'Underground Economy': 
an old budget bogeyman 

Third College D an Beverly 
Varga 's decision to reopen the 
Resident Adviser position 
upon completion of an 
equitable and extensive 
selection process is deplorable. 
Having served as an R.A. at 
Third several years ago, [ had 
the opportunity to participate 
first hand in the R.A. selection 
process as a mem ber of the 
selection co mmittee. From 
this experience I can honestly 
say that the selection process, 
rather than being unfair to 
people of color. is actually 
des ig n ed lo fa vo r I heir

For example, dunng the

The notion that certain 
special interest groups on 
campu s feel they s hould 
receive prioritized notification 
of the opening of the R.A. 
position is pure bunk. Among 
other Qualities, an individual 
who proposes to become a good 
R.A. must be especially adept 
at two tasks. The person must 
be aware of what 's happening 
on campus , and he/s he must 
also be able 10 take the

'Underground Economy' ghost 
continued from page 3 
mechanics and piano instruc· 
tor, among others. If we 
haven't indulged in unclaimed 
income ourselve . we all know 
friends who have. Unreported 
moneymaking has been going 
on ever since the Internal 
Revenue Service came into 
existence, and probabl" 
always will. 

It's the moonlighter and 
friendly neighbors who give 
the underground economy its 
romant ic. if rebelliou ~. 
character. Yet. as freewheel · 
ing as they may seem, these 
players are most vulnerable to 
economic swi ngs that those of 
us blessed with s traight 
alaries. rai es and fringe 

benefits are able to escape. 
Thi s uncertainty may 

explain why the monetary 
value of the underground 
economy increased. as Simon 
concedes. only 10 percent per 
year between 1975 and 1980. 
Of the entire Gross National 
Product , its share has widened 
slowly, if at all. Despite the 
ever·present contempt for high 
taxes. most Americans still 
prefer to play by the rules of 
the IRS code. 

Politician s and tax 
collectors may therefore be 
underestimat ing the tenacity 
of the underground economy 
a nd overest imating it 
dimensions, 

At best, predicts Ann Witte.

"t hey may be able to get the 
underground economy down. 
with reasonable policies. by 25 
percent. If you wanted to 
s pend $2 for every $1 in 
revenue. you could obviously 
go further." 

Beyond the obvious need to 
hold every American to the 
s ame fair s tandards of 
taxation, pani c·s tricken 
budget·balancers won't get 
very far by heaping their woes 
on the backs of disadvantaged 
youths and elderly Americans, 
unemployed college graduates 
and millions of illegal a liens 
who. without the underground 
dollar, ot herwise might be on 
the dole or in the st reet s.

A pollan the Reagan 
Admini s tration' s defense 
poltcy brings both good news 
and bad news to the White 
\louse. For t he first time since 
the que~tion was asked in 
1978: "In conducting our 
nat Ion ':-, forcll{n polley dUring 
the pa~t year the US 
gO\ernmcnt's attitude. on 
balance. has been (1)[00 tough, 
(2) too weak. (:~) about right" 
the proport ion of Americans 
part icipatmg in the ForeIgn 
Policy Association's Great 
Deci sion s program who 
selected "too weak" declined 
- and declined precipitously . 
from a high of 69 percent in 
1981 toonl y 36 percent in 1982. 
About 38 percent of the 
respondents described US 
foreign policy as "about 
right. " and 25 percent "too 
tough," A significant ly large 
number - 17 percent - did 
not select any of the three 

Favorites 
at Third 
continued from page 3 
with the highly competItive 
selection of people applying for 
such an important college 
po ition. I find it ironic that 
she has now taken such an 
acute interest. 

Increased minority involve-
men t is u nq ues t ion abl y 
needed at Third, as it is in our 
society as a whole. But this 
in v 0 I vern e n t s h 0 u I d be 
initiated by the minorit y 
s tudent s them elves, who are 
repeatedly accorded opportu· 
nities to further participate in 
the affairs of the college. 
Irrespon sible actions of a 
college dean who alJows 
personal emotions to override 
rationality will do nothing to 
alleviate the long term 
problem of in s ufficient 
minority involvement. It is 
interesting to note th.,t the 
woman who refers to Third as 
"t he college where people 
count" is attempting to create 
a college environment ·in 
which certain people count 
more than others.

While these figures indicate 
a su bs tantial ga in in approval

two Reagan mi litary policies 
appear to be in [rouble: 

Defense spending: Onh

as much mer the next fiye

asked for In hi s original 
request; 33 perecent thought 
the ( 1 should spend more 
than in the past but less than 
President Reagan asked for ; 
and 20 percent wanted to 
spend Ie s than in the past. 

Arm first, negotiate 
later: Only 26 percent agreed 
wit h the Administration that 
the US shou ld concentrate on 
an arms buildup before 
ent ering new arms control 
negotiation; 60 percent 
favored abiding by the terms of 
SALT II as long a the Soviets 
do and resuming arm control 
negotiation . 

On the question of the 
ret urn to the military draft , 
only 45 percent of Great 
Decisions respondents were in

UCSD Medical Center 
warns of poison plants 

When planning your garden 
thi s s pring, keep in mind that 
many common plants can be 
highl y toxic to humans and 
pets , sugg sts Bet ts Wallace of 
the an Diego Regional Poison 
Center, a part of UCSD Medi· 
c al Ce nt e r (U ni ve r s i tv 
Hospital). . 

Tox ic plant s are the third 
most common cau 'e of poison' 
ing in the US, after drugs and 
hou ehold prod ucts, says Wal · 
lace, Mos t of those poisoned 
are children under five, she 
add, . 

Poi o n Ce n ter s t aff 
members also report occa· 
sional call s from ow ners of 
pets and livestock poisoned by 
plant s t hey have ea ten. 

Some pl a nt s, s uch as 
oleander , are so toxic that the 
ingest ion of a si ngle lea f can 
cause dea th, There have been 
reports of deat hs among child· 
ren who used oleander twigs 
a skewers to roas t hot dogs. 
Even smoke from burn ing 
oleander bush s can cause 
illness, says Wallace. 

If young children pl ay in 
your garden, it 's a good idea to 
ch ec k w ith a re put a bl e 
nursery or your local poison 
cent er about t he toxicity of 
plants you are t hinki ng of 
grOW1l1g, There are many you 
can choose for you r garden and 
home t hat are known to be reI · 
atl\ely n,)J1 ·toxIC , including 
dah"a~, dai~ies, ferns, gerani -
um", natal plum, indian haw-
t horne and eugema. 

~emembcr, howevpr, th"t 
an~ plant can callst' unex-
pect ed react ion" 111 cert a 111 

individual s, and always check 
with a poison cent er or your 
physic ian if a pl ant not Ilor-
malh' con ~ idered food has been 
inge·· t ed , 0 pa rt of a n 
unknown plant ever ~ hould be 
eaten or brewed as " tea, add s 
Wa ll ace. 

Certain pl ants, such as wild 
mus hrooms, should be avoided 
altoget her, since ed ible and 
toxic \ ariet ies are diffi cult to 
di sti ng ui s h, evpn by t he 
ex pert s. Folk methods of " tes t-
ing" wild mushrooms have 
been found to be unreliable, as 
membersof a anDiego family 
recent Iy learned , everal peo-
ple, including three children, 
were seri ously poisoned aft er 
they ate some "deat hcap" 
mus hrooms. They firs t had 
"tes ted" the mushrooms by a 
popu lar Laotian method: boil · 
ing them wi th r ice and deem-
ing t hem safe to cat if the rice 
did not turn red. 

If young ch ildren or pets are 
around the yard, be careful 
about the chemicals you use, 
adds Wallace, Snail bait and 
plant foods probably should 
not b used unless you keep 
kids and pets out of t he yard , 
she ad\' ises, • orne pell ets 
resemble cat and dog food, 

I n general, she add'i, it's a 
good idea to ~upef\' ise very 
voung children in your garden

A battle of arlllS 
UCSD's Allen pitches 10 strong 
inning , defeats Biola ace 2-1 

B, BILL FI~II 
. '>"Iff \\' ri1l'1' 

It \\ <I'" a ducllx'l\\t'Cn t\\oarm ... . onedl'l'ei\ ing. the 
olher blll1dlllg. OIW \\ould {'y{'ntuilll\, collap.., l', the 
other endure. Onl' would be {'valuated , Ihl' other 
congratulated. 

Such "'as t he confrontatIon on Saturday \\ hen 
Biola's ace right hander, Todd Worrell : faced 
UCSD\ ace left hander. Bob Allen, in the most 
excit ing pitcher's duel of t he Triton setlson. 

Drawn bv the attraction of Worrell's fastballs 
were SCOU lS- from at lea. t a half·dozen major league 
teams . As the tall speedballer took the mound each 
inning, t he scouts drew t heir radar guns . The 
meters were set down, however, when it was Allen's 
t urn to pitch . The bearded \('leran said l(lter that 
this did n't bother hIm. Mavbe it should have. 

Allen pitched ten inning~, compared to Worrell's 
nine and two-thirds: both pitchers allowed SIX hits 
apiece; Allen fanned nine to Worrell 's thirteen; the 
lefty walked onl y two, th righty five . The most 
important stati stic. however. as it is in any game, 
was t he fin a l core - Uc. D 2. Biola I. 

Worrell s tarted strong. wh iffing eleven batters in 
fi ve innings . but gradually Triton bats found his 
fast ball, clocked early on at 9O-plus miles per hour. 
UCSD had men on in every inning after the fifth . 
Fighting off a 1-0 deficit. the Triton got a clutch 
two-out single from Dana Ostrum int he sixt h, tying 
the score. 

Allen . utilizing his repertoire of varied motions 
and speeds, worked his way out of jam in the 
seventh and ninth . Following his ninth inning 
performance and a slow trip to the dugout. he 
addressed his teammates with a loud sigh . 
declaring, "That's enough. You guys can score 
now." One inning later, Brian Kummer cro sed the 
plate on a passed ball to comply with Allen's wish. 

After the game, couts approached Todd Worrell. 
Winning pitcher Bob Allen "didn't hear a word " 
they said. 

Most of the crowd disappeared with the outcome 
of the pitching extravaganza, perhaps having a 
negative effect on the Tritons for the second gameof 
the double-header. 

The winless Keith Yokomoto started, and once 
again , he was victimized by poor fielding and fluke 
hits. This further demonstrated Coach Lyle Yates's 
theory that teams seem to perform well for ome 
pitchers. and weakly for others. 

Yokomoto needed assistance from relievers Mark 
Cartier and Eric Wood to help subdue the massacre. 
Though UCSD wa pummelled 12-0, Yates had 
already accomplished his goal of winning two of the 
three league games on the schedule last week. 
Predictably, it wa the deceiving arm of Bob Allen 
that won them both.

The UCSD women tallied 92

Sting stung 
by Sockers 
in 1-0 match 

8y ANDREW KEELER 
It took all of the regulation 

lime and three minutes of 
overtime for the San Diego 

ockers to keep their season 
record perfect with a 1-0 
victory Saturday nigh t. 

What was billed as a grudge 
match between the NASL 
outdoor champion (Chicago 
Sting). and the indoor champ 
(San Diego), turned out to be 
an effort in fu tilily by two 
teams who are JUSI now 
getting in shape for the season. 

After a scoreless 90 mmute" 
that saw I he Sting take only 
nine shots on goal as eompan.>d 
to the ockers' 22. it was 
veteran detender Gert 
WI(;'czorkowslu who played a

"The Game of the Week" 

The Associated Students has funded the Sports Activity 
Board to promote intercollegiate and intramural sports on 
campus. This quarter the SAB will be sponsoring the intramural 
game of the week. 

The first game of the week matched men's AA. volleyball 
teams. Kim Duclo and h is Muff the Tragic Fagg took on Jeff Orias' 
Spazzies. Although Muff had only four players, Duclo, Steve 
Stoyanow, Todd Jones, and Jim Lambach, they soundly 
defeated Spazzies 15-7, 15-3, and 11-7. Rumor has it that this 
winning quartet is looking for players. It's hard to imagine why 
but if interested contact the head Muff, Kim.
