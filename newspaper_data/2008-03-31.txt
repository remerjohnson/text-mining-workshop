Marking the second time in less 
than a week the campus has received 
threatening remarks from a self-pur-
ported animal rights activist known 
only as Alf, the UCSD School of 
Medicine complex was evacuated for 
13 hours yesterday after a campus offi-
cial received a text message calling for 
researchers to release all animal sub-
jects or face “dire consequences.”

Biology professor Ching A. Ling 
said that she was heading to her lab-
oratory at the Leichtag Biomedical 
Research Building at about 6:30 a.m. 
when she received the text message, 
which demanded that she release all 
Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly 
research subjects from their cages by 
the end of the day.

Union Calls

Fox Perks

The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
filed for impasse with the University 
of California yesterday after universi-
ty officials rejected a union proposal 
that would have used half the pay-
roll budget for the university’s 11,000 
patient care technical workers to buy 
UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox a 
new desk chair and Dr. Seuss hat.

The dispute arose at the annual 
celebration of Dr. Suess’s birthday 
outside Geisel Library last month 
when, on her 30-minute lunch break 
from giving enemas all morning (and 
the first time she had eaten since her 
14-hour night shift the previous day), 
vocational nurse Juanita Johnson 
could not bear the sight of the clearly 
overworked chancellor with a striped 
top hat on her head, cake smears on 
her cheeks and a Dixie cup of fruit 
punch that left her fingers disgust-
ingly sticky.

demands higher salary 
for struggling chancellor.

Police discovered the body of Trent Jacobs in Price Center Sunday evening. Authorities believe Jacobs was 
murdered in conncetion with UCSD’s fraternity hazing scandal after he was mistaken for a former pledge. 

Frat Hazing Dispute Results in Death at Price Center

By Not Kimberly Cheng
I Swear

A 22-year-old nonaffiliate male 
was found dead in Price Center 
yesterday in what UCSD police are 
calling an apparent homicide relat-
ed to mistaken identity.

Trent Jacobs, a Radio Shack 
cashier from Lakeside, was discov-
ered by a janitor around 2:30 a.m. 
According to the medical examin-
er’s report, Jacobs was bludgeoned 
with a Rossi wine bottle and suf-
focated with the sleeve of a Sigma 
Nu sweatshirt.

Lead university spokeswoman 
Stacie A. Spector said that Jacobs 
was not a student at UCSD, but 
could offer no explanation as to 
how he arrived on campus.

Police noted that Jacobs shared 
his name with the alias used by 
a former Sigma Nu pledge who 
reported instances of hazing within 
the fraternity in November. UCSD 
Police Lt. David Rose said that offi-
cers were investigating the possibil-
ity that the murder was somehow 
related to this report.

“Most of the frat bastards and 
sorority sluts didn’t seem to under-
stand that Trent Jacobs wasn’t really 
the informant’s name,” Rose said. 
“I thought it was pretty obvious 
myself.”

The anonymous Jacobs has 
received multiple death threats on 
popular social networking Web site 
Facebook over the last five months, 
most of which were posted by mem-
bers of the campus’ Greek com-
munity.

“Guys, I’m going to shoot my 
load at Trent Jacobs’ fucking face,” 
read one message, posted in a thread 
called “Let’s Fuck Trenty Boy.”

Pi Kappa Alpha member Alan 
Roof, a vocal advocate of the fra-
ternities’ innocence, said he did not 
understand the definition of “alias.”

“Um, what?” Roof said. “Fuck.”
Authorities are also investigat-

ing a number of pictures posted 
on Facebook that depict a man, 
similar in appearance to Jacobs, 
being beaten by a group of men in 
Sigma Nu sweatshirts. Other pic-
tures depict Jacobs lying in a puddle 
of vomit and being forced to take an 
“elephant walk,” a hazing ritual that 
requires the pledges to walk in a 
circle while holding on to the geni-
talia of the person behind them. A 
third photo album shows the same 
group of men attempting to dig a 
hole in the concrete on top of which 
Jacobs’ body was discovered.

UCSD Student Organizations 
Adviser Marilyn Russell, who works 
with the fraternities and sororities, 
said that she was performing her 
own investigation of the issue.

“I am totally going to do an 
investigation,” Russell said. “And if 
that means soliciting young Sigma 
Nu pledges for sex, then I’ll do it, 
and I’ll do it well.”

Investigative Snitch

In what has been hailed as a 
historic decision, the UC Board of 
Regents approved a proposal that 
will bring a women’s football team 
to UCSD in 2010. The 11th-hour 
decision, which was pushed through 
by pressure from director of athletics 
Earl W. Edwards, aims to improve 
the campus environment and, more 
importantly, embraces women’s 
rights at the notoriously chauvinist 
university.

The athletics department is in 
talks with personnel from the NFL 
about spearheading the NCAA’s 
first all-female football program. 
According to Edwards, UCSD has 
met with NFL and college officials 
about leading the historic new team

She could not comment as to 
what the investigation entailed, 
when it was being performed, or 
who would be involved, but did 
mention that she had the correct 
“equipment.”

Justin Buck, executive director 
at Pi Kappa Alpha’s national head-
quarters, said the issue was largely 
exaggerated by the media.

“I’ve been given no conclusive 
proof that anyone is really dead,” 
Buck said.

A.S. President Marco Murillo 
said that it’s important for people 
like him, who came from the Preuss 
School, to call for increased campus 
diversity.

“Students need to take diversity 
into their own hands and call for 
greater oversight,” he said.

“The fact that these precious crea-
tures are being tortured for so-called 
science is reprehensible,” the message 
read. “I, Alf, will do something fucking 
crazy if you don’t let every single buzz-
ing, bar-bodied beauty go.”

Ling alerted Vice Chancellor of 
Research Arthur B. Ellis, who instruct-
ed her to comply with Alf ’s request, 
and released nearly 100,000 fruit flies. 
Researchers throughout the build-
ing who house D. melanogaster in 
their laboratories emptied their fruit 
fly stocks as well. In total, Ellis esti-
mated that about one million flies were 
released.

UCSD Police Department Chief 
Orville King said that after Ling 
reported the text message, he alerted 
fellow UC officers to stop issuing park-
ing tickets and instead aid FBI officials 
in locking down the medical sector. 
King said that the officers should be 
praised for their swift action in the face 
of such grave danger.

“These brave men and women were 
down on their hands and knees sniff-
ing for potential bombs,” King said. 

Although officers recovered no 
suspicious items, the medical school 
remained shut down as rogue fruit flies 
swarmed the area, limiting visibility.

Ling said that because she was 
forced to release her animal test sub-
jects, her life’s work was ruined. She 
and her colleagues had been studying 
basic fruit fly genetics, including how 
wing and eye shape are affected by 
inbreeding.

“I guess I’ll just have to move on 
to other animals, like endangered 
apes, which don’t have as much sig-
nificance to Alf,” she said, cradling 
a few dead fruit flies in her hands. 
“So much for the advancement of 
science.”

Ling said she did not know if

her $1-million grant from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development would be jeopardized 
now that the research is lost.

Yesterday’s events came on the 
heels of a similar lockdown last week 
after another researcher found a 
handwritten note taped to the build-
ing demanding that all feline research 
subjects — currently housed in only 
one Leichtag laboratory — be released 
immediately. The note indicated that 
a bomb would explode if campus offi-
cials did not comply. 

“Free pussy!” the note read. 
“Keeping pussy all locked up with no 
air is seriously fucked. Also, I’m hun-
gry.”

As in the case of the fruit flies, 
the cats were released. Campus police 
recovered all but one, which was found 
dead with wounds similar to bite marks 
on its face, paws and tail.

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said 
that the university would prevail over 
Alf ’s “despicable actions” even if it 
meant she would have to negotiate 
with Alf personally.

“I’m ready to rumble,” Fox said in a 
statement. “Bitches get stitches.”

Meanwhile, UCSD police are con-
tinuing to investigate reports that a 
large, brown, alien-like creature similar 
to the namesake star of the late 1980s 
television sitcom “Alf” was seen run-
ning away from the Leichtag building 
yesterday morning after the threat was 
reported.

“We don’t think there’s a correla-
tion between the reports and the party 
responsible for the threats,” King said. 

Fox said the medical complex 
would be closed until April 3 to allow 
researchers to properly grieve over 
their losses.

but a final decision has not been 
made out of fears of potential sexual 
harassment suits.

According to Associate Athletic 
Director Kenneth Grosse, numer-
ous calls originating from the Pacific 
Islands expressing interest in the pro-
gram has the athletics department 
rejoicing over the decision to bring an 
all-women’s football team to UCSD.

“All I can is that I’ve been dream-
ing for something like this for a long 
time,” Grosse said. “It will be just like 
‘A League of Their Own.’”

The proposal calls for the construc-
tion of a multimillion-dollar stadium 
complex to be built at the current 
location of Warren Field. The complex 
will also feature a shopping and enter-
tainment center with occupants such 
as Forever 21, off-Broadway’s Vagina 
Monologues and LaShonda Nguyen’s 
Nails and Weaves.

According to Edwards, students 
and La Jolla trophy wives will have 
more on-campus entertainment 
and shopping options, and campus 
life will positively benefit from the 
expansion.

“I is getted eXcited,” he said.
In an effort to minimize the cost to 

students, UCSD has secured private 
funding for the stadium from numer-
ous sponsors including Tampax, Diet 
Coke and Perez Hilton. In fact, in 
the wake of last year’s athletics ref-
erendum, the athletics department 

was careful not to have the students 
bear any further cfee increases, and 
it has secured a majority partnership 
with Luna Bar to offset construction 
costs. Although the final name of 
the stadium has not been confirmed, 
sources close to the negotiations say 
that the complex will be known as 
Luna Sport Stadium.

The proposal will also strength-
en the foundation of the athletics 
department, doubling the number 
of senior associate athletic directors 
and halving the responsibilities of all 
associate athletic directors. In addi-
tion, the proposal calls for the addi-
tion of a “Nutritional Supplements 
Advisor,” and former Olympian 
Marion Jones was rumored to be at 
the top of the list of qualified candi-
dates, for her understanding of the 
new athletes and how to push the 
physiological limits of their bodies. 
Unfortunately, Jones will not be able 
to assume the position until she’s is 
released back into society following 
her stint in prison.

Although there was little opposi-
tion to the final draft of the proposal, 
Edwards admits that some sacrifices 
had to be made to get it approved. 
According to Edwards, a combination 
of Title IX and budgetary require-
ments will necessitate the discontinu-
ation of several teams including, but 
not limited to, softball, women’s bas-
ketball, women’s crew, women’s soccer, 
women’s volleyball and women’s water 

polo. The only women’s sport to be 
spared was fencing.

“In order to keep things equi-
table, some lesser things had to go,” 
Edwards said. 

The usually indifferent student 
body met the news with indifferent 
indifference, but some dissenters did 
question the long-term viability of a 
football team.

“I knew there was interest in get-
ting the school a football team, but I 
think they took this a step too far,” 
Sixth College junior Ethel Marcel 
said, surfacing for air from her engi-
neering textbook. “Who are they 
going to play?”

Grosse said that the athletics 
department is still trying to figure 
out who the Tritons would play, but 
thinks they can find a niche in a 
Division-III conference.

“It’s true that no school has ever 
fielded a women’s football team, but 
we’re determined to make this work,” 
he said. “I would put good money 
on our girls over those squares at 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps any day.”

UCSD kicks off the project with a 
ceremony on April 25, when heralded 
women’s rights advocate Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox will make her first 
and last appearance at an athletics 
event in the history of her term and 
history itself.

Six Women’s Teams Cut to Accommodate Football
▶ FOOTBALL, from page D1

“This woman deserves our help,” 
Johnson told a group of day laborers 
outside the Price Center expansion 
site who still had not received a water 
break. “The ice in her punch melted 
hours ago, and she’s been working 
hard to fake that smile since 9 a.m. 
this morning. The least we can do is 
show a little respect 
for the woman who 
takes such affection-
ate care of us. I mean, 
if we don’t hold the 
umbrella to keep her 
neck shaded in this 
heat, who will?”

“And what about 
those lollipops in the 
jar on her desk?!” 
cried Revelle College 
sophomore Liz 
White. “Last time I 
walked in there, the 
green ones were out, and they all 
seemed pretty gummy.”

Despite pleas from university 
officials apprehensive about the state 
budget crisis, Johnson has also led 
AFSCME in a similar campaign to 
order a new desk chair stuffed with 
peregrine falcon down feathers, a 
“practical utility” that she said will 
enable the chancellor to finally relax, 
and ultimately scrape together her

with greater ease. 
“We’re talking about the bottom 

of the food chain here,” Johnson said. 
“No one knows the noble saga of 
searching for a parking spot in the 
morning like Fox. She has it rough.”

At a recent bargaining session, 
some dotty students, faculty mem-

and retention 
as evidence that

ratory thera-
pists are worth

of day. 
However, the chivalrous Fox is 

always quick to de-escalate poten-
tially career-blemishing dialogues.

“You should see the chair,” Fox 
said. “It’s well worth the retirement 
pensions of 675 nurses. Perhaps even 
1,000.”

Dear Hadley,
It’s sad to see that the Guardian 

runs articles that consist entirely 
of someone complaining about the 
little messages that companies put 
on packaging.  

Do you seriously not have any-
thing better to write about, or do 
you just think that people will find 
your article cute and snarky? 

Did In n Out really set you off 
by putting 10 characters in a diffi-
cult to find place on their soda? 

Do the messages on Dove can-
dies really throw you off so much 
that you go on a hissy fit about it 
in the newspaper? 

I’m hoping the whole thing is 
supposed to be some kind of poor-
ly played joke, but even if it is, no 
one is laughing, except at your 
poor attempt at humor.

Did you make up this article 15 
minutes before your deadline after 
eating a piece of candy? 

Did you really just call dove 
candy a wannabe fortune cookie? 

Did you really just rant about 
one of the few fun, semi-individu-
alized things that these “profit-
driven commercial giants” do?

You embody everything that is 
wrong with the student body at 
UCSD.

Yeah I know it’s 3:35 a.m. on

Also, this time of year after heavy 
winter rainstorms, street pebbles and 
debris get washed to the edges of 
a roadway, making for unsafe con-
ditions for cyclists. That debris is 
something you might not feel given 
the thousands of pounds of mass 
of your car. You must also be really 
barreling down the street at non-
human-scale speeds that obscure 
your ability to even notice the debris 
as you roll along, squandering our 
time–rendered inheritance of about 
51 thousand pounds of ancient phy-
toplankton material deposited on the 
ocean floor for every gallon of fossil 
fuel gasoline burned (see footnote) in 
your ‘green credential’ hybrid car. If 
you really are a cyclist as you profess, 
and you “admit biking’s awesome-
ness. It’s healthy, saves the planet,” 
then shouldn’t you put away your 
thinly veiled “us vs. them” attitude 
and be focused on better facilities 
for cyclists, better street sweeping of 
debris and wider or multiple bicycle 
lanes, car exclusion curbs and bol-
lards, secure bike parking etc...

If your contempt for cyclists and 
car-centric urban planning ethos 
isn’t clear by now to the reader, than 
they too are probably guilty of using 
the mass of their cars to intimidate 
cyclists as you hint at, twice in your 
piece: “…they’re just deepening the 
distrust between cars and bikes, mak-
ing drivers resent them and putting 
themselves in very real danger.” And 
again later in your piece: “…as they 
offend law-abiding drivers and put 
their own safety at risk.”

And what of your implied threats? 
They are mostly a nonissue. Most 
drivers I encounter are courte-
ous and safe around me. You do 
hint at one truth though, a cyclist’s 

plastic- helmeted body is no match 
for the mass and physics of a 3,000 
pound bullet. There will only be more 
cyclists out on the roads as gas prices 
increase and Peak Oil approaches. So 
shouldn’t you be e-mailing your cities 
street sweeping division and working 
for safer facilities generally instead of 
fomenting a war out on the streets?

You want a war, bring it on miss! 
And to anyone who agrees with you 
and also has a command of the laws 
of physics and the power of bul-
lets, the 3,000 pound kind or the 
real kind, I’ll be out on my bicycle 
in top cardio-vascular condition, 
locked, loaded, and ready to stand 
my ground and neutralize any of your 
threats, implied, verbal, or otherwise. 
In general, If I’m attacked in the state 
of California, I don’t have to retreat, 
no matter where I am, even out on 
the side of the street. I can stand my 
ground and defend myself, if neces-
sary with deadly force. You didn’t 
think us bicyclists are all just a bunch 
of granola-eating pacifistic hippies 
did you?

In all likelihood though, instead 
of stopping your coffin-on-wheels, 
and getting out, you and your boy-
friend and his fraternity brothers will 
be gone like a flash in the pan with 
your finest cowardly, knee-jerk reac-
tion: “hit the gas!”

Self-Proclaimed ‘Loser’ 
Still Can’t Get a Date

Dear Hadley et al,
I was really disappointed with 

your blind date contest. Frankly, it 
sucked. It took you a week or so to 
put the site up (even though you 
advertised in the paper). The survey 
itself was horrifyingly superficial 
and lacked depth. In other words, 
I could find a better online quiz 
to tell me which LOLcat I am. Oh 
yeah, thanks for the non-existent 
e-mail with “the results.” I checked 
online for the full story... impressive 
paragraph. For the money you put 
in, you couldn’t even pull a human-
interest story out of it?

In fact, we really have no evi-
dence that this whole thing wasn’t 
just a ploy to hook your own friends 
up on the Guardian’s bill.  And how 
the hell do you determine the “most 
compatible” couples out of a mul-
tiple-choice test which asks such 
romantically-inclined questions as 
“Who would you rather have die, 
yourself or 10,000 people,” anyway?  
Was there ANY work involved 
on the part of the Guardian staff 
besides slapping together a guy and 
a girl who happened to answer all 
the questions identically?

So much for journalistic trans-
parency.

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

If a three-peat defines a sports 
dynasty, Donna Bean is on the tail 
end of a political dynasty — one that 
has often tread into new territory for 
student government. As this year’s 
lone A.S. presidential candidate, the 
Student Voice! leader will presumably 
be the slate’s third consecutive chief 
to occupy the office and continue a 
political period that saw renovations 
of the A.S. constitution, the Sun God 
Festival and Price Center. 

But innovation has stoked uncer-
tainty: As the first councilmembers to 
employ former A.S. President Harry 
Khanna’s constitution, this year’s 
politicians were what Bean called 
“guinea pigs;” complete operational 
reformation of the campus’ flagship 
event has bred caution as it returns 
for its 26th run this May; and protests 
over the campus’ political representa-
tion of students have flared up in 
several communities, from Thurgood 
Marshall College to the RIMAC 
Annex.  Bean will inherit an extended 
history, but also looming problems.

In 2006, Khanna, an Earl Warren 
College alumnus and founding mem-
ber of the SV! slate, molded today’s 
configuration of the A.S. Council, a 
move that drew both relief and criti-
cism. Khanna’s structure downsized 
college senators’ powers and consoli-
dated many of the council’s depart-
ments under a trio of vice presidents. 

This year, Bean was the first 
full-term vice president of student 
life, overseeing the departments 
of programming, diversity affairs 
and athletic relations. Bean’s term 
was lively within those divisions. 
Administrators and student officials 
teamed to re-evaluate and rebuild the 
Sun God Festival. Also, the athletics 
department put to work a windfall 
of referendum money it received the 
previous year by student vote.

UNION 
TALKS

By Reza Farazmand
Associate News Editor

Mark G. Yudof was appointed 
president of the University of 
California last week amid heavy 
praise from members of the UC 
Board of Regents who voted unani-
mously in his favor. 

Yudof was recommended for the 
position earlier this month by the 
regents’ special advisory committee, 
which was commissioned to find can-
didates to replace current President 
Robert C. Dynes after he announced 
his resignation last August. 

Board of Regents Chairman 
Richard Blum, who headed the search 
committee, said that Yudof is the best 
candidate for the job. 

“It’s unusual to find a brilliant 
academic mind who has the vision 
for what a university can be and 
help to grow it, and also has a really 
proven management track record,” 
Blum said at an open-session Board 
of Regents meeting. “I don’t believe 
we could have found one person 
in the United States of America or 
maybe abroad that is better suited for 
the job of president of the University 
of California than Mark Yudof.”

Yudof, whose starting date has 

yet to be determined, currently 
serves as chancellor of the 15-cam-
pus University of Texas system, a 
position he has occupied since 2002. 
Prior to that, he served as president 
of the four-campus University of 
Minnesota system. 

Blum said that Yudof ’s previ-
ous experience managing univer-
sities similar to those in the UC 
system enhances his ability to meet 
the restructuring and financial chal-
lenges now facing the university’s 
administration.

“The choice of a new leader is an 
integral part of our effort to restruc-
ture the administration of the uni-
versity and make it more efficient,” 
Blum said in a statement. “The most 
important part of that restructuring 
is securing a leader to move the effort 
forward. Mark Yudof brings a strong 
commitment to academic values and 
also a strong record of performance 
as a manager.”

Although Yudof has yet to lay 
out any specific plans for how he 
will deal with the challenges of 
his new position, he said he is 
enthusiastic about taking charge 
and espoused his own philosophy 
regarding how a university system 
should be run at a press conference 
after the regents’ meeting during 
which he received approval.

“The role of the system office is 
to facilitate the campuses and what 
they’re trying to accomplish and add 
value,” Yudof said. “If you can’t add 
value you want to get out of the way. 

Officials applaud regents’ 
selection, Mark Yudof, 
from the University of 
Texas system.

The job of the system is to ensure 
that the whole is greater than the sum 
of the parts. It’s to facilitate collabora-
tion, not to erect obstacles, not to be 
one more hurdle to get over when 
you’re waiting to have a great law 
school or a great medical school or 
recruiting a great faculty.”

The regents’ announcement last 
week that Yudof was a leading can-
didate in the selection process, how-
ever, raised speculation over wheth-
er the university would be able to 
afford him. His post at the University 
of Texas paid Yudof a total com-
pensation package valued at nearly 
$800,000, including a base salary of 
$528,860, and made him one of the 
highest-paid officials in higher edu-
cation. 

Yudof ’s position within the UC 
system will afford him a total com-
pensation package of $828,000, 
including a base salary of $591,084.

The California Nurses Association 
announced last week that the 10,000 
registered nurses employed at 
University of California medical cen-
ters have ratified a new three-year con-
tract, marking the end of an 11-month 
bargaining process between CNA and 
the university.

The contract, which expires in 
September 2010, includes a 6-per-
cent wage increase across the board, 
increases of up to 8 percent at student 
health centers and additional raises for 
UCSD and UC Irvine nurses, who are 
the lowest-paid in the UC system.

“Our nurses play a vital role in the 
delivery of excellent health care that 
UC is known for, and this contract 
continues the university’s practice of 
providing competitive, market-based 
increases for the nurses in this bargain-
ing unit throughout the UC system,” 
Howard Pripas, UC executive director 

New contract provides 
salary boosts, staffing 
protections for nurses 
at UC medical centers.

Facing protests from local

recently announced that they will 
halt plans to demolish the historic 
University House.

“The university has decided to 
seek alternative options to demoli-
tion,” Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary 
C. Matthews said. “We will focus 
instead on a renovation, rehabilita-
tion or refurbishment of the existing 
house.”

of labor relations, said in a statement.
In addition to increasing wages, the 

contract limits the use of mandatory 
shift rotations, which force employees 
to switch from day to night shifts, often 
compromising their performance. The 
nurses also rejected a “paid time off” 
program that would combine sick leave 
and vacation days into one pool, argu-
ing that the initiative would encourage 
nurses to go to work ill.

CNA’s UC Director Beth Kean said  
there has been overwhelming opposi-
tion to the PTO program since it was 
first proposed, and that she is relieved 
that the university has acknowledged it.

“[The university] finally realized 
that nurses did not want it,” she said. 
“That was a big victory for us.”

Kean added that the contract’s tech-
nology restrictions — which prevent 
new technology from replacing nurs-
es’ roles in delivering care to patients 
— signify a triumph for patient safety.

“We don’t want some kind of com-
puterized protocol replacing a nurse’s 
judgment,” she said.

Nicole Savickas, human resources 
and labor coordinator for the UC Office 
of the President, said the university was 
disappointed that the nurses refused 
to implement the PTO program, espe-
cially since they rejected the recom-
mendation in the neutral fact-finding 
panel’s report. However, she said that 
overall, she is pleased with the outcome 
of the negotiations.

“Ultimately, UC believed it was 
important to compromise on this issue 
in order to reach agreement for our 
nurses,” she said. “We are absolutely 
satisfied with the agreement.”

Kean said she is excited about the 
university’s willingness to compromise,

Agreement May Add Momentum 
to Other Union Negotiations 

▶ UNION from page 1 but said its timing is interesting, con-
sidering that the Higher Education 
Employer-Employee Relations Act 
would have enabled CNA to begin 
organizing for a vote to strike if an 
agreement had not been reached this 
month. The fact-finding period ended 
on March 10, and the final bargaining 
session took place  March 13-15.

“The fact that UC made no move-
ment in 11 months of bargaining, then 
dramatically changed [its] bargaining 
posture three days after CNA was legal-
ly allowed to start organizing for a strike 
vote is not a coincidence,” she said. 

The threat of strike is a grave one, 
she said, citing a similar situation in the 
Bay Area, where 10,000 nurses at Sutter 
Health facilities are scheduled to today 
conclude a 10-day strike.

Kean said the patient safety issues 
addressed in the nurses’ contract are 
prominent throughout the state, and  
said she hopes to use this success as 
leverage for medical workers battling 
similar initiatives such as the PTO pro-
gram. She said CNA plans to coordinate 
with the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees, 
which has been fighting since August 
2007 to secure a contract for the uni-
versity’s 11,000 patient care technical 
employees.

“UC has a long-term plan to shift 
benefit costs to its employees and to 
resist any increased voice and power of 
the unionized staff in terms of benefit 
protections and other employee pro-
tections,” she said. “If CNA had not 
been successful in fighting off PTO, it 
would have been very difficult for the 
AFSCME units to resist it.”

twice that of the departing Dynes. 
“He’s expensive, but he’s worth it,” 

Blum said. 
Yudof will enter the position of 

UC president at a time when a state 
budget crisis has placed immense 
financial burden on the university. In 
January, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
announced his budget for the 2008-
09 fiscal year, revealing a $409-mil-
lion shortfall in funding for the uni-
versity that signals impending stu-
dent fee increases and extensive pro-
gram cuts. Despite these difficulties, 
however, Yudof retains an optimistic 
outlook for his tenure. 

“Universities are always having 
budget crises,” Yudof said. “In the long 
run, this is a very healthy univer-
sity system with very high standards. 
While there might be some reversals 
in the short run, in the long term, the 
university looks very good.”

Yudof added that one of his 
goals in his new position will be to 
increase state contribution to uni-
versity funding. 

Yudof faced similar pressures 
from state political bodies during 
his time in Texas. Early in his tenure 
as leader of the UT system, he strug-
gled with the state legislature over 
the right to set student tuition, even-
tually gaining control over tuition 
levels and placing a cap on student 
fee increases. Yudof said he will take 
a similar stance in California.

“The closer tuition is to zero the 
happier I am,” Yudof said. “I don’t 
want anyone to be precluded from 
the UC [system] by high fees.”

local groups over what to do with 
the Pueblo Revival-style home and 
surrounding property. Traditionally 
the residence of the UCSD chancel-
lor, the house has since remained 
vacant. Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
currently lives in a rented residence 
off campus.

Although the university had 
planned to demolish and rebuild 
University House, which sits atop 
an ancient Indian 
burial site dating 
back to almost 
10,000 B.C., local 
Indian tribes 
argued that there 
would be no way 
to prevent dam-
age to the remains 
buried beneath 
the residence. 
Historians and 
other activists 
were also opposed 
to a plan that included demolition, 
arguing that University House, which 
was put on the National Register 
of Historical Places last November, 
holds historical and architectural 
importance to La Jolla.

“We are currently looking at 
alternative solutions that will enable 
this property to be used in a way 
that will be productive and accept-
able to all involved,” university 
spokeswoman Pat JaCoby said.

Although opponents to the 
demolition protested the lack of 
open communication and said the 
university was unwilling to con-
sider options other than demolition 
earlier in the year, new university 
plans have taken preservation of the 
house into consideration. 

“We know this is a property

“Our goal is to develop a plan

that the programming phase will be

to even wait for United Nations 
inspectors to conduct a thorough 
search of Iraq for any nuclear 

weapons, instead choosing to 
launch headfirst into a war with-
out the consent of the majority 

On March 19, 2003, President George W. Bush invaded Iraq under 
the banner of national security. 
On that day, the president set in 
motion events that would con-
tinue for over five years, and the 
prospect of another five years 
seems an unbelievably sad possi-
bility. Five years of fighting, five 
years of death and destruction, 
five years of lies and deception. 

While the all-consuming stress 
of finals week was distracting 
UCSD students from reality, the 
five-year anniversary of the war 
in Iraq came and went with rela-
tively little fanfare, save a small 
demonstration in downtown San 
Diego.

With the 2008 presidential 
election drawing near — and 

more importantly, as students 
start to step outside the sheltered 
bubble of the UCSD campus and 
enter the real world — a thor-
ough understanding of the war 
becomes essential. 

Barely a week after declaring 
war, Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld confidently told ABC’s 
“This Week” that the Bush admin-
istration knew the location of 
Iraq’s weapons of mass destruc-
tion: “They’re in the area around 
Tikrit and Baghdad and east, 
west, south and north somewhat.” 
Sounds like he had absolutely no 
idea, right?

The American government 
invaded Iraq under the pretext 
of finding Saddam Hussein’s sup-
posed WMDs and making the 
world a safer place. Bush refused 

of U.S. allies. So much for global 
democracy, huh? To date, not one 
single weapon of any such capa-
bility has been found in Iraq, yet 
the fifth year of the war has given 
way to a sixth.

 On May 1, 2003, not even two 
months into the war, Bush stood 
atop an aircraft carrier in front of 
a banner stating “mission accom-
plished” and told the American 
public and servicemembers: “My 
fellow Americans, major combat 
operations in Iraq have ended.” 
Since that date, a war based on a 
lie has rambled on unsuccessfully 
for five years. 

Fast-forward almost a year to 
April 28, 2004, when photos of 
the Abu Ghraib torture pictures 
were leaked to the press. The 
government tried to act like this 

blatant violation of the Geneva 
Convention was a first-time 
occurrence. Did they really think 
we are ignorant enough to believe 
that? Apparently they did, and 
it makes me sick to think that 
maybe we just might be. 

Aside from sending young 
men and women into a war of 
private self-interest, the Bush 
administration did not provide 
troops with adequate supplies 

A Steep Climb for the PresidentA Steep Climb for the President

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

There is no shortage of optimism in the University of California, 
and Mark G. Yudof ’s appointment last week as the next UC presi-
dent illustrated that systemwide pomp perfectly. The University of 
Texas chancellor was feted to a rain of compliments and cash.

“I don’t believe we could have found one person in the United 
States of America or maybe abroad that is better suited for the job of 
president,” said Board of Regents Chairman Richard Blum, handing 
Yudof his $828,000 compensation package. A high price tag — which 
the San Diego Union-TribuneSan Diego Union-TribuneSan Diego Union-T  reported as twice that of outgoing presi-
dent Robert C. Dynes — but worthy of a global recommendation.

But approached from a different angle, there is also no short-
age of pessimism in the University of California. Yudof ’s entrance 
has sparked a bevy of introspective discussions, ones that regu-
larly expose ugly systemwide truths: student fees are spiking, state 
funds are shrinking and the UC Office of the President is a mess. 
Concerns over those topics have flared up at the end of Dynes’ ten-
ure, leaving Yudof an inheritance of bulky problems.

Yudof has already acknowledged the university’s shortfalls, 
especially at the managerial and financial levels. What might be 
seemingly insurmountable quandaries —  how to fill the system’s 
$400-million budget hole and how to heal the university’s black eye 
from compensation scandals — receive an enjoyably matter-of-fact 
response from Yudof, who admitted the university’s budget crisis, 
but added that “universities are always having budget crises.”

It’s true; no matter what Californians think about the state’s 
projected $14.5-billion deficit, it pales in comparison to the deficit 
at the onset of Dynes’ administration in 2003, when the Legislative 
Analyst’s Office projected a $21.1-billion shortfall. 

Yudof has pledged to make state funding a priority and brings a 
reputation of political wrangling from Texas. It is a welcome attribute; 
after his approval by the regents, Yudof expressed a need to offer all 
UC-eligible students admission. 

“The closer tuition is to zero the happier I am,” Yudof said. It was 
a refreshingly lofty perspective that almost wipes away the dark veil 
that has plagued UC students since fees began their unstoppable rise 
over a decade ago.

As for managing a multicampus system, university officials high-
light Yudof ’s experience with the 15-campus University of Texas system 
as evidence of his capabilities. The two systems are remarkably compa-
rable in size and scope: the number of campuses, undergraduates, 
faculty and staff are relatively similar. The similarities will undoubtedly

Guardian: Do you feel Mark Yudof will benefit from his expe-
rience at the University of Texas system? 
LB: I think that’s a huge advantage. He also has medical centers, 
or academic health science campuses, that report to him as well 
as a Department of Energy lab, so those all have unique issues 
related to them and I think his background will be very helpful 
to help him acclimate to the University of California quickly. 
He was a top candidate from the very beginning because he has 
these unique similarities to our system.
Guardian: So you expect those things to make an easier transi-

a system would have been a huge learning curve.

versity system as opposed to a single 
university system, is it just a larger 
scope to manage?
LB: Well, no, it’s actually more complex 
because you want each campus to have 
a certain amount of autonomy, yet 
there are certain strengths that you can 
harness among the campuses to excel 
the system forward. 
Guardian: How do you feel it’s been 
managed so far?
LB: I think that we have extremely 
qualified and exemplary chancellors 
at all of our campuses. So I think 
they have all done an excellent job at 
moving all their individual campuses 
forward I think that there are a num-
ber of things as we discussed at the 
regents meeting about the office of 
the president that need to be restruc-
tured. I don’t think that’s necessarily 
the fault of any president or adminis-
trative staff. 

I just think its kind of kind of a 
natural evolution, things require over-
sight and reevaluation as they grow.  I 
think this is a time when we’re taking 
a real critical look at the organization. 
Especially if you’ve got an organization 
that’s very dynamic and you’re trying 
to move it forward and there’s a lot 
of growth and a lot of fingers in the 
pie, then it’s easy for things to grow 
and expand to a point that they may 
need to be looked at or moved off 
to somewhere else and I think that’s 

ease the transition in UC manage-
ment. But more importantly, Yudof 
should fully utilize his standing as 
one of the few UC presidents to come 
from outside the 10-campus system, 
bringing freshness and innovation to 
a stagnant, idling administration.

and shrugged off its responsibility 
to protect our soldiers. 

While addressing a crowd of 
ground troops on Dec. 8, 2004, 
Rumsfeld was questioned by very 
discontented soldiers about why 
they lacked armor and supplies. 
The secretary’s response? “You go 
to war with the army you have ... 
not the army you might want or 
wish to have.” Apparently billions 
upon billions can be spent on 
making planes and tankers pro-
duced by Bush’s fishing buddies 
via no-bid contracts, but the funds 
for keeping troops alive just don’t 
exist. 

U.S. weapons inspectors ended 
their search for WMDs on Jan. 12, 
2005, claiming that none could be 
found in Iraq. Yet the war con-
tinues.

Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.) 
called for the withdrawal of troops 
on Nov. 18, 2005, representing 
a growing opposition among 
American senators and congress-
men who see the need for a change 
in direction concerning Iraq, even 
if they were the same politicians 
who originally gave permission 
for Bush to invade the Middle 
Eastern country.

March 19, 2006: Time maga-
zine revealed that U.S. Marines 
killed unarmed Iraqi civilians in 

Haditha the previous November. 
After the U.S. government tried to 
cover up the murders as the result 
of a roadside bomb, the truth came 
out — a group of marines went on 
a murderous rampage, killing 15 
innocent Iraqis, including seven 
women and three children. 

Vice President Dick Cheney 
used the anniversary of the Sept. 

11 attacks to remind the American 
public of the dangers of exercising 
its freedom of expression. While 
giving a speech on Sept. 11, 2006, 
Cheney said criticizing the war 
only serves to aid terrorists and 
encourage their cause.

U.S. ally and former British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair 
announced a plan for the with-
drawal of all UK forces from the 

region on Feb. 21, 2007. Looks 
like we’re in this thing on our 
own. 

On April 26, 2007, the Senate 
passed a bill to withdraw troops 
by a 51-46 vote. A month later, 
Bush vetoed the bill and talk of 
bringing the troops home was 
shelved. Gotta love those checks 
and balances. 

Gen. David Petraeus, the top 
commander in Iraq, told a con-
gressional hearing that he did 
“not know” if the Iraq war makes 
America any safer. 

Dec. 6, 2007: Only 36 percent 
of military families now approve 
of the war. 

March 19, 2008: The five-year 
anniversary of the war is reached, 
but hardly any of Bush’s goals have 
been accomplished. More than 
4,000 Americans have died, along 
with hundreds of thousands of 
Iraqis. Spending for the war eas-
ily exceeds $500 billion and that 
number will only increase. 

The facts and events in this 
timeline are nowhere near com-
plete, but hopefully it will give 
an insight into the atrocities that 
have been committed by our gov-
ernment over the past five years 
and will motivate us to do every-
thing we can to make sure that 
five years from now, a similar 
timeline does not exist.

what’s going to happen in the admin-
istrative restructuring of the office of 
the president. It will be interesting to 
see with the new president coming in. 
You have to leave enough flexibility for 
that person to make some critical deci-
sions too and to allow them to tailor 
the organization to a model that they 
have found to be successful with their 
style in the past.
Guardian: What do you find are the 
most pressing problems right now to 
the common staff member?
LB: I think that we’d be trying to 
avoid talking about the elephant in the 
room if we didn’t say compensation. 
People are concerned and especially 
it’s a tight budget year, so people are 
nervous about whether there will be 
salary increases, they’re worried about 
whether we’ll have to restart contribu-
tions to retirement, they’re worried 
about doing more with less in a tough 
budget year.
Bill Johansen: There’s a lot of uncer-
tainty, including the restructuring of 
the Office of the President, it’s going 
to have impact potentially on cam-
puses if programs are shifted from 
the Office of the President to cam-
puses and likewise in some respects 
it will be a preview of some restruc-
turing efforts that may take place at 
some of the campuses to, so that’s the 
biggest thing there are just a lot of 
unknowns right now. 

You know this budget is not going 
to be easy because you have faculty 
and staff salaries, you have student fees 
and then you have some programs that 
actually need to get an influx of money. 
So any one of those is going to cause 
a lot of heartache to make a decision 
and some of the budget is so bad that 
everything is going to be hit.

W i t h annu-
al expendi-
tures of more 
than $2.2 bil-
lion consuming 
most of its $2.3-
billion yearly rev-
enue, UCSD is often 
forced to sleep with 
one eye on its pock-
etbook. Students typi-
cally confront this reality most directly 
through living and eating on campus, 
where the clash between frugality and 
emerging social movements such as 
fair trade underscores a historic chal-
lenge for UCSD Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality administrators.

Fair trade, a certification process 
that ensures quality living conditions 
for farmers who cultivate products 
such as coffee, tea and cocoa, first 
made an impact on the internation-
al economy in the late 1990s. The 
burgeoning movement at UCSD 
— largely initiated by student groups 
such as environmental-advocacy 
organization One Earth, One Justice 
— began approximately five years ago. 
Since then, the student-led push has 
gradually expanded fair-trade options 
on campus, with a majority of the 
upgrades happening in the last six 
months.

Fair-trade-certified items are paid 
for in advance, guaranteeing farm-
ers at least their country’s minimum 
wage for the products they grow. 
The increased wages are of critical 
importance to impoverished farmers 
in developing countries, said OEOJ 
principal member Rishi Ghosh.

“Right now, the options for farmers 

are either to die of starvation, or ‘Sell 
my coffee for 10 cents and die of a little 
less starvation,’” Ghosh said.

OEOJ took its fair-trade message 
to campus leaders as early as 2005, 
when the A.S. Council passed a reso-
lution encouraging more widespread 
purchase of fair-trade products. The 
council followed up in 2006 with a 
proposal to establish criteria to make 
UCSD a fair-trade university — mean-
ing each campus retailer would need 
to sell two or more fair-trade products 
in order to qualify. 

The council also implored 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to create a 
steering committee for the promotion 
and oversight of the fair-trade label, 
invoking the clause in UCSD’s prin-
ciples of community that expresses a 
commitment to “the highest standards 
of civility and decency toward all.”

However, university spokeswoman 
Pat JaCoby said she could find no evi-
dence that such a committee was ever 
implemented.

OEOJ has been working with cam-
pus administrators, including those 
at HDH, for the last four years. In 
that time, the groups have worked to 

incorporate more 
fair-trade products 
on campus, a pro-
cess both parties 
have described as 

laborious and 
ongoing.

have a 
responsibility 

to offer fair-trade prod-
ucts to socially conscious 

students who are compelled to eat on 
campus but do not wish to spend their 
dining dollars on noncertified food 
and beverages.

“I should be able to buy a product 
which I know wasn’t produced with 
slave labor,” he said. “Otherwise, it’s 
not fair to consumers.”

HDH Associate Director Steven 
Casad said that while the campus 
is committed to human rights and 
making wise environmental choices, 
transitioning UCSD to a complete-
ly fair-trade university is impossible 
because of its dual responsibilities to 
its students and the surrounding com-
munity.

“It’s our responsibility to offer 
choices,” he said. “I know I could go 
outside to Vons and not buy a fair-
trade product because it’s cheaper, so 
we really have to offer both. Since we 
do have fair-trade products that are 
being purchased, we have to look at 
that space on the shelves and say ‘We 
want you to buy fair trade, but if you’re 
not buying fair trade, then something’s 
got to give.’”

While the cost of certified fair-
trade products may be higher than 

their  counterparts, OEOJ principal 
member Daniel Nguyen stressed that 
proliferation of the fair-trade process 
will forge a more sustainable change 
for developing communities.

“A lot of people are skeptical that 
buying fair-trade products will make 
a difference,” Nguyen said. “But it will 
make a difference, because for a coun-
try that only makes a thousand dollars 
a year, buying even 100 of their prod-
uct makes it possible for the commu-
nity to invest in primary education, or 
even a health facility.”

Currently, Oakland-based non-
profit TransFair USA is the only entity 
that can provide a fair-trade certifica-
tion for products imported into the 
United States, limiting the number of 
offerings that meet its strict criteria. 
Consequently, fair-trade products are 
often costly and difficult to obtain in 
the needed quantities, Casad said. 

Despite these setbacks, UCSD has 
increased its selection of fair-trade cof-
fee and chocolate, and in February 
all of the dining halls switched to 
Peet’s fair-trade coffee blend. Varieties 
of certified chocolate are also widely 
available, he said.

While the dining halls require prod-
ucts in varying sizes and packaging 
specifications, which may hinder the 
amount of fair-trade options available 
to them, Casad said that HDH uses 
the convenience-store atmosphere of 
Earl’s Place as a testing ground for new, 
environmentally responsible products. 
As HDH expands, it is planning to sta-
tion a convenience store within each 
dining hall, which will open the door 
to increased product options in the 
future, he said.

Earl’s Place Manager Cathryn 
Fernandez, whom Ghosh and Nguyen 
described as “very progressive,” said 

she finds the fair-trade movement 
invigorating, and frequently visits 
trade fairs with other HDH employees 
in search of newer and more sustain-
able products.

“It’s a good avenue of education as 
far as exercising your power through 
consumerism,” she said. “There are a 
lot of students who don’t know the dif-
ference between fair trade and organic, 
but there are those who do, which is 
exciting because it’s a way to flex your 
power.”

Fernandez said that Earl’s Place 
offers more than 65 fair-trade-certi-
fied products in total, though around 
40 are varieties of tea that rotate based 
on available shelf space. She said that 
while she enjoys attending trade fairs 
to locate new products, she has to be 
cautious of vendors trying to disguise 
uncertified products as fair trade due 
to the movement’s popularity.

For some students, like Earl Warren 
College junior Stephanie Lim, abuse 
of the term has made her somewhat 
skeptical of products claiming to be 
fair-trade certified.

“I’m not saying that the term ‘fair 
trade’ is bad, but it is misleading,” Lim 
said. “The term is much too liberally 
applied and exploited by large compa-
nies to increase their profit margins. 
I believe we should be skeptical and 
discerning when we make a fair-trade 
purchase. If we’re going to make an 
effort to buy something environmen-
tally and socially beneficial, we should 
assure that it is genuine and not just to 
soothe our consciences.”

Ghosh and Nguyen expressed 
a similar attitude toward improper 
labeling, and said that OEOJ is careful 
to watch for these problems, especially 

I t has been a couple of years since the last time I ran in my under-wear. My camera and I were there 
for the first Undie Run event, hosted in 
2005 by “UCSD Students for a Sexier 
Campus.” Its Facebook group is evi-
dence of the fact that I’ve held the title 
of official Undie 
Run photog-
rapher since 
then, though I 
have neglected 
the position for 
all but the first 
couple of runs. 
Last quarter’s 
finals week, however, marked my tri-
umphant, scantily clad return to the 
pastime.

The first Undie Run was a glorious 
response to this campus’ perceived lack 
of sex appeal. A dedicated crowd gath-
ered at midnight near RIMAC Arena 
and began a new UCSD tradition while 
wearing costumes that ran the gamut, 
from (relatively) conservative tights 
with superhero-style underwear worn 

on the outside to the lone drunkard 
running naked. The common desire 
to be sexy and proud united a humble 
swath of students frustrated by their 
peers’ repressive study habits. Strangers 
running in underwear carried away not 
just their clothing in crumpled piles, 

but new friend-
ships as well.

At the latest 
Undie Run, I didn’t 
see many of the old 
faces I remember 
from years past; 
the original group, 
ephemeral to begin 

with, had completely dispersed. I felt 
like an Undie Run veteran, and my role 
as an impartial observer conflicted with 
a vague obligation to pass on the event’s 
culture and show the new class how it’s 
done. The sights were still immediately 
familiar: guys in thongs, lace mixed 
with sneakers, outrageous costumes 
running side by side with sweaty co-
eds in the same boring underwear they 
wear every day. The crowd was also 

larger than I remembered. It appeared 
that the tradition had survived a turn-
over in its constituency. Though I was 
troubled to see a gender ratio that clear-
ly favored males, what the crowd lacked 

in X chromosomes they made up for 
with the eagerness to burn calories in 
various states of undress.

My own vestment was, as it had 
been in past runs, a simple pair of box-

ers. It was a choice I made to balance 
the requirement of taking photos with 
my desire to not expose more than I

▶ The number of students (out of nine) 
running for all-campus senator positions 

under the Student Voice! slate. 

CHRISTINA AUSHANA/GUARDIAN

By Matthew L’Heureux • Senior Staff Writer



MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  7

SV!, Bean lamented bumps the council 
has encountered.

“There are some kinks to be worked 
out,” she said of the constitution.

Some of the problems stem from 
broken links, according to Bean. While 
the installment of academic senators 
allowed students to identify with their 
politicians by areas of study instead of 
by college, the prominence of student 
groups is unbalanced between the divi-
sions. While physical and biological sci-
ence senators have established resources 
such as the Triton Engineering Student 
Council, social science senators lack 
a similar support base. The problem, 
Bean said, illustrates that the discon-
nect between UCSD voters and politi-
cian still exists — one that she would 
like to bridge in her presidency.

And although she lauds the new 
constitution’s benefits, she also 
expressed a strong desire to move past 
its implementation stage. She said she 
plans to revisit the document to “ham-
mer out” lingering constitutional issues 
by fall 2008.

“A lot of times it’s a lot easier for 
organizations to just focus internal-
ly,” she said. “[They] do a lot of revi-
sions and feel like they accomplished 
something when really they didn’t do 
anything but waste time on internal 
revisions.”

Of the three original principles of 
SV! — college accessibility, campus 
climate and student political power 
— Bean is most vehement about stu-
dent representation. Students not only 
lack control over their own resources, 
she said, but wield little political power 
on vital campus committees. The 
majority of the committees have only 
one student representative, and even 
those select few have difficulty staying 
involved because unaccommodating 
staff and administration.

“Students don’t check their e-mails 
every … second,” she said. “There have 

been so many times where I barely get 
an e-mail about scheduling … the next 
hour or two and I have class. That’s a 
critical flaw.”

Student members are often over-
looked within committees, Bean said. 
TMC drew fire this past year when 
students decried the addition of a non-
voting student to a committee selecting 
the college’s next dean. Bean also said 
the Transportation Policy Committee 
was problematic, as only two of the nine 
representatives are undergraduates.

“Students are invited to those com-
mittees but they really have no input,” 
she said. “They allow the students to sit 
on the committees but they don’t ever 
really listen to their input.”

Bean’s SV! slate aims to change 
the campus’ attitude to its students by 
making their collaborative voice heard, 
Bean said.

But if the origins of SV! are any indi-
cation of the slate’s ability to fuse differ-
ent campus communities, Bean will 
absorb support from a wide and varied 
selection of student groups. SV! politi-
cally consolidated two of the previous 
year’s slates, Revolution! and Student 
Empowerment! and united the campus’ 
largest voting bases, the former serving 
Greek constituents and the latter repre-
senting diversity and outreach interests. 
The process of nominating a SV! presi-
dential candidate involves a coalition of 
student officials, including the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee and 
Interfraternity Council. 

The goal, Khanna said, was to 
ensure the slate’s longevity and preserve 
its ideology.

“We wanted, as a slate, to be able to 
a long-term vision and set of principles 
that future slate members could follow,” 
he said.

within UCSD.
For example, they said a student employee 

at one of the dining halls approached them at a 
recent meeting to voice concerns over labeling 
practices she viewed as deceptive. According to 
the employee, the fair-trade coffee decanter was 
filled with nonfair-trade coffee when they had 
run out of the former product.

“From our experience, the dining halls cer-
tainly do not adequately train their employees 
about fair-trade certification, if they do at all,” said 
OEOJ principal member Chris Westling.

Casad disputed the claim, saying the situation 
could not have happened because all coffee on 
campus is now fair-trade certified. In addition, 
he said that the individual facilities’ managers are 
expected to understand the definition of fair trade 
and the basic information necessary to educate 
their employees on the topic.

“We train those people who are doing the 
coffee,” he said. “When you have 700 employees, 

you’re always going to have someone give you a 
different answer.”

Despite these issues, Casad said that HDH’s 
relationship with OEOJ has been largely positive, 
and recommendations made in the group’s most 
recent proposal are either already in place or 
under consideration.

Due to the ongoing nature of the fair-trade 
certification process, Casad said he is optimistic 
about the new opportunities that UCSD will be 
afforded in the future.

“A lot of our focus and the direction we are 
looking for in this coming year is directed by sus-
tainability and fair-trade issues,” he said. “Just as 
a human being, it’s important to want everybody 
to be treated fairly. If there’s anything we can do 
as Americans, or the University of California as 
an entity, to help support that, I think we want to 
make that statement.”

was willing to while doing my job. When I run in 
my underwear, I run around far more than any of 
the other participants in order to get the shots I 
need. If I’m not stopping to crouch for a low angle 
shot, I’m climbing on trashcans to better frame 
the crowd. With so much positioning, I would 
rather worry about taking photos than adjust-
ing my small garment, lest I traumatize innocent 
bystanders.

This latest Undie Run used Price Center as a 
staging area. I spent the last minutes before launch 
figuring out my camera settings and dodging 
drunken students demanding that I take their 
pictures while they make stupid poses. I have no 
use for such photos, and so on top of the challenge 
of taking pictures of fast-moving subjects in the 
dark, I had to focus my lens and take the photo 
before people started to succumb to their seem-

ingly natural instinct to crowd together and make 
faces at the camera.

After an impromptu parade of men in thongs 
above Price Center’s fountain, the flesh-colored 
mass of students gained momentum, climbed the 
steps toward Price Center and made their way 
toward Revelle College. My path ran parallel to the 
group, so I could stop frequently without getting 
trampled. The joy of digital photography allowed 
me to run with my camera on my side, shutter 
clicking away and filling my memory card while 
I dodged eucalyptus trees. Every 50 yards I made 
sure to stop and try some panning shots before 
sprinting ahead of the pack once again.

The group collected itself at Revelle fountain, 
where the SD Board Club awarded free tickets to 
a male and female student, though I have no idea

what the criteria were for selection. Male thongs 
were once again displayed proudly on top of the 
fountain. Shouts of “CLICS!” soon made their 
way through the crowd, and it wound its way up 
to the library’s door. But the shouting had alerted 
security, which successfully blocked the door. The 
mob was resilient, however, and shouts of “Geisel!” 
made their rounds. A sweaty stretch of students 
made their way toward Dr. Seuss’ namesake in a 
weary thin line that took several minutes to pass a 
police car parked in Revelle Plaza.

Geisel Library received the mob openly — there 
wasn’t much the staff could do besides smile at 
the bare-bodied group navigating the first floor. 
Stunned students making last-minute finals prepa-
rations either quietly waited out the deluge or 
whipped out cell phones to take videos. The group 
exited after a few minutes, and students started peel-
ing off the main body amid triumphant shouts.

The run was over, but a third wave of shouts 
halfheartedly suggested OceanView Terrace as the 
next destination. The Undie Run thus gave way to 
an underwear-walk to OVT with a smaller handful 
of students. I got to know Christopher, a student I 
had come to recognize over the course of the night 
from his thong and fanny pack. After 20 minutes 

of running, he had enough fervor left to let a friend 
put out a cigarette on his forearm on the way to the 
dining hall. Once there, his hairy ass visibly ruined 
the appetites of several late-night diners, but still he 
managed to glean an ice cream bar from someone’s 
meal points.

It was a priceless scene, but common in my 
experience with the Undie Run. Some might credit 
the ability to run without shame in your skivvies 
to the security of traveling with a large number 
of like-minded peers, and others might say it’s the 
effect of a drunken fog limiting your inhibitions. 
Whatever the source, the energy always lasts long 
enough for a leisurely walk in public to cool off, 
even when it’s long after everyone else has put 
clothes on and gone home. After parting ways 
with Christopher and his friends, I walked back to 
where I had stashed my car keys. I was still in my 
underwear, and passed a few people as it neared 1 
a.m. By their confused stares, I assumed they had 
no idea what the Undie Run is, and I’m sure they 
wouldn’t entirely understand its appeal until they 
try it themselves.

60.4-percent field goal and 94.4-per-

“The thing that I’ve always felt is 
you have to earn your success, and that’s 
one thing that this group did,” Carlson 
said. “We worked hard in practice, we 
worked hard on the mental side of 
things. [The team was] understanding 
that adversity is going to come, and it’s 
often how you handle that adversity 
that determines how you are going to 
be in the future.”

While obviously pleased with his

is already preparing for next season.

“I’m really proud of our senior

“They all worked extremely hard; a 
very determined group of seniors who 
all wanted to go out on a good note,

SWIM & DIVE — UCSD broke 10 
school records, won three events and 
had a Triton awarded Male Swimmer 
of the Meet at the four-day NCAA 
Division II National Championships 
at the University of Missouri pool. 
Despite having a very small team, 
the Triton women managed to place 
fourth overall and the men, led by 
the meet’s best swimmer, sophomore 
sprinter Daniel Perdew, took seventh.

“This was a great meet for us,” 
junior Aubrey Panis said. “It really 
reflected all the training we did and 
all the work we put into the other 
competitions.”

The first day of nationals set the 
pace with two new school records 
and a win. Perdew won his first event, 
the 50-yard freestyle, and set a new 
school record with a time of 20.07 
seconds. Meanwhile, the women’s 
team set a new school record while 
placing third in the 200-yard medley 
relay. The team of juniors —Panis, 
Kendall Bohn, Jennifer Sims and 
Erinn Deters — will have their names 
in the school record books after their 
combined time of 1:45.12.

The second day of nationals 
showed more of the same, as the 
Tritons set an additional three school 
records. Starting the day off with the 
200-yard freestyle relay, the women 
placed second with a time of 1:34.66 
from a team of freshmen, consisting 
of freshman Anju Shimura, Panis, 
Deters and junior Shannon Simonds. 

The men followed with a third-
place finish and a school record in 
their own 200-yard freestyle relay. 
Sophomore sprinters Perdew and 
Todd Langland teamed up with senior 
Evan Hsiao and freshman Brandon 
Maryatt to finish third with their 
record-breaking time of 1:21.54. 

Junior Steven Hardy, Hsiao, 
Perdew and Langland placed fifth 
in the 400-yard medley with a time 
of 3:22.00 for the men’s team while 
the women’s team placed second and 
raced to a school record in the same 
event behind Shimura, Bohn, sopho-
more Karla Holman and Simonds, 
swimming a 3:48.13. 

Panis placed eighth in the 200-yard 
freestyle in 1:52.47 and the women’s 
100-yard butterfly turned out to be 
an exciting race between Holman and 
Sims, with both swimmers breaking 
the school record. In the end, Holman 
placed fourth, edging out fifth-place 
Sims with her time of 56.02.

Three more school records fell 
on the third day: Shimura placed 
fourth in the 100-yard backstroke 
with 56.53; Bohn raced to fourth 
place in the 100-yard breaststroke 
in 1:04.45; and Sims broke her own 
school record in the 200-yard but-
terfly, dropping 2.23 seconds off her 
previous time to place second with 
a time of 2:01.84. To finish out the 
day, Panis, freshman Ashtyn Douglas, 
Deters and Shimura swam a new 
school record of 7:29.18 in the wom-

Junior forward Henry Patterson scored UCSD’s first points in NCAA Division II Tournament history and 
went on to score 10 points in the Tritons’ 80-60 loss to the Seawolves in Anchorage, Alaska on March 14.

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The great-
est season in the UCSD men’s bas-
ketball team’s Division-II history 
came to an end on March 14 when 
the Tritons fell in the West Regional 
quarterfinals of the NCAA Division 
II Tournament to No. 11 University of 
Alaska, Anchorage by an 80-60 final 
score. The game was hosted by West 
Region top-seed Alaska Anchorage 
at the Wells Fargo Sports Complex 
in Anchorage, Alaska. UCSD ends its 
historic season with an 18-12 record, 
its best since 1998-99 and since mak-
ing the move to Division II.

Junior forward Henry Patterson, 
in his final season at UCSD, opened 
up the Tritons’ first appearance in the 
Division-II tournament with a layup. 
Unfortunately, UCSD scored only once 
more in the next seven minutes as 
Alaska Anchorage opened up an 18-4 
advantage. Sophomore guard Jordan 
Lawley and junior guard Alan Husted 
accounted for five straight Triton 
points that cut into the lead. After the 
Seawolves extended their lead back 
to 14 with 8:24 remaining, Lawley 
again embodied UCSD’s underdog 
determination, scoring nine points 
in a five-minute stretch to pull the 
Tritons within seven. The Seawolves 
responded with a three-point play and 
a three-point field goal, highlighting a 
10-4 run to close out the first half with 
Alaska Anchorage up 39-26. 

“One of the hallmarks of this team 
has been we never give up,” head coach 
Chris Carlson said. “We always com-
pete, all the way up until the final horn, 
which is something I was very proud of 
throughout the year. There have been 

times when we got down big, and we 
didn’t fold, which I appreciate.”

The Tritons would find themselves 
in a big hole after the break. The 
Seawolves were able to extend to a 
20-point advantage early in the second 
half as UCSD went scoreless for the 
first 3:54 coming out of the break. 
Lawley was the first Triton to find the 
basket in the second half, but despite 
back-to-back field goals as part of his 
career-high 24 points, UCSD climbed 
no closer to the Seawolves than 15 
points in the second half. 

“Whenever you go and play on 
the road it’s going to be a difficult 
test, and when you’re playing a No. 
1 seed in their place it’s going to be 
tough,” Carlson said. “Anchorage is 
very deserving of a number one seed. 
They’re very skilled, especially their 
two big guys, Carl Arts and McCade 
Olson. We knew we were going to have 
a tough time guarding them.”

Olson and Arts led the way for 
Alaska Anchorage, with 28 and 21 
points, respectively. Olson also added 
a game-high seven rebounds, while 
guard Luke Cooper was just shy of a 
double-double with nine points and a 
game-high nine assists.

Lawley led UCSD, going 8-of-13 
from the field and 6-of-6 from the 
charity stripe as part of his career-
high-scoring night. Patterson added 
10 points, while junior forward Darryl 
Lawlor grabbed a team-high five 
rebounds. Junior guard Andrew Hatch, 
in his final game for the Tritons, tied 
Lawlor with a team-high three assists. 
As a team, UCSD shot 44.4 percent 
from the field and 76.2 percent from 
the free-throw line, but could not keep

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons struggled in the second half 
after leading for the entire first half of 
their March 15 West Regional semifi-
nal game against No. 2 Seattle Pacific 
University, losing the contest 76-67 
and ending their season with a 25-10 
record. 

The Tritons faced a formidable team 
that had not lost a game all year and, for 
much of the game, it looked like UCSD 
would end the Falcons’ perfect sea-
son. The Tritons scored the first points 
on sophomore forward Erin Noonan’s 
jumper and built a 15-6 lead with 13:03 
left in the half. Backed by a strong half 
from Noonan, UCSD took a 35-29 lead 
into the break.

The Tritons continued to domi-
nate in the second half, taking their 
first double-digit lead of the game with 
15:02 left in regulation off of junior for-
ward Michelle Osier’s layup. With 12:08 
left in the game and the Tritons holding 
onto a 50-40 lead, the Falcons fought 
back with seven unanswered points 
that cut UCSD’s lead down to 50-47.

A converted free throw gave Seattle 
Pacific its first lead with 6:26 left in the 
game, and the Falcons never looked 
back from that point. The Tritons 
struggled to knock down their shots 
and keep possession of the ball in the 
last five minutes of the game, allowing 
the Falcons to steal the win.

Despite losing, the Tritons played a 
tough game against an undefeated team 
that they have never beaten in Seattle. 

“We dominated the game and lost 
it in the last five minutes,” Osier said. 
“It was still fun playing against Seattle 
Pacific, who was 28-0. From start to 
finish, we had them on their heels.” 

Four of UCSD’s five starters had 
double-digit-scoring games while the 
fifth starter, senior point guard Alexis 

Mezzetta, posted 12 assists in addition 
to her nine rebounds. Osier and senior 
forward Meaghan Noud led the scor-
ing for the Tritons with 18 points each. 
Osier also pulled down 12 rebounds for 
UCSD in the losing effort. 

“We didn’t play at our best some of 
the time against Seattle Pacific, but we 
had some standout performances even 
though we lost,” Noud said. 

The first game of the Regional 
Tournament that sent the Tritons to 
the semifinal game pitted them against 
CCAA-rivals Cal State San Bernardino. 
The Tritons posted victories the first 
two times these teams met this season, 
and the third meeting was no different. 

The teams went back and forth 
for most of the first half, with neither 
controlling the game. With the score 
tied 28-28 and 4:28 left in the first half, 
the Tritons used scores from Noud, 
Osier and senior center Alexis Gaskin 
to enter the break with a 35-30 lead. 

The two teams continued to battle, 
and with 9:41 left in the game and 
the Tritons holding onto a 43-40 lead, 
Noud’s three-pointer gave the Tritons a 
six-point lead. UCSD extended its lead, 
outscoring the Coyotes 16-6 in the last 
10 minutes of the contest to win and 
advance to the regional semifinals.

“We shut down their best player and 
held her to far below her average,” Osier 
said. “We dominated the game — they 
never had a chance. Even sometimes 
when the score was close, we were still 
dominating.” 

UCSD held Cal State San Bernardino 
center and CCAA Player of the Year 
Vanessa Wilt to four points and no 
Coyote scored in double digits. Noud 
led the Tritons with 23 points while 
Mezzetta had a game-high 10 assists 
running the point. 

The Tritons ended their season with 
25 wins — the second best in the 
program’s history — but were unable to 
repeat last season’s historic 27-win team 

that was one of the last eight teams 
standing in the NCAA tournament. 

“I expected a lot from our team 
because we have a lot of talent and expe-
rience,” Noud said. “I’m still impressed 

with how far we went — a lot of really 
good teams don’t get as far as we did.”
