second, dubbed the “other approved lender list,” 
contains the remaining five.

The three options on the top-tiered preferred 
lender list include a large financial institution, a 
nonprofit lender and a local lender.

To be considered for either list, loan compa-
nies must fulfill requirements such as providing 
personnel and technology to improve loan pro-
cessing, as well as presenting timely and relevant 
information to staff and students. Companies 
looking to be one of three choices on UCSD’s 
preferred lender list must also provide a special 
electronic service that eliminates paperwork, 
thus expediting loan processing.

De Anda said he sees preferred lender lists as 
a positive component of financial aid, as long as 
they are constructed in the best interests of the 
students. 

“If done correctly, the list helps students avoid 
predatory lenders and ‘fly-by-night’ lenders, who 
get in and get out with quick profits and won’t be 
there when it is time to service the loan,” he said. 
“There has been a marked increase on direct-to-
consumer marketing, especially on the Web, and I

In an effort to curb “deceptive practices” in 
the $85-billion-per-year student loan industry, a 
set of new regulations issued Nov. 1 by the U.S.  
Department of Education requires colleges and 
universities to add a minimum of three unaffiliated 
loan companies to the preferred lender lists they 
provide to students. 

Effective July 2008, these regulations follow an 
inquiry of the college loan industry by New York 
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who conducted 
a nationwide investigation in March into possible 
corrupt relationships between universities and loan 
companies. Cuomo found evidence of questionable  
practices, ranging from stifled competition among 
the lending industry — resulting in a poor range 
of loan terms — to discreet financial arrangements 
between colleges and lenders that enriched loan 
companies at students’ expense.

He then contacted more than 400 colleges and 
universities nationwide, requesting that they end 
relationships with lenders that coerce students into 
entering loan agreements that are not in their best 
interest, or that may have hidden consequences. 
Cuomo argued that universities should ensure that

In response to growing concerns 
about liberal alcohol policies regu-
lating local beaches, the San Diego 
City Council voted Nov. 5 to endorse 
a yearlong ban that would prohibit 
drinking at the city’s beaches, bays 
and coastal parks.

Councilman Kevin Faulconer, 
whose district includes Mission, 
Pacific and Ocean beaches, pressed 
for a permanent ban but was unable 
to rally enough council support. 
City Attorney Michael Aguirre then 
proposed a one-year trial ban; the 
compromise passed in a 5-2 vote. 
Councilman Ben Hueso cast the 
deciding vote when he switched in 
favor of the ban last minute, meeting 
the minimum threshold for passage.

Faulconer began his council ten-
ure opposed to such a regulation, but 
agreed to establish a Beach Alcohol 
Task Force to examine the issue fur-
ther. After eight months, the commit-
tee was united on 21 proposals but 
gridlocked over whether to permit 
drinking on San Diego shores.

Motives changed after Labor Day, 
however, when Pacific Beach faced 
national media attention for a drunk-
en brawl that broke out after a man 
trying to recover an all-terrain police 
vehicle from the surf was arrested. 
Police officers were pelted with beer 
cans and water bottles by the combat-
ive mob, and lifeguards had to shut

San Diego residents Scott Koehler (left) and Jesse Bandle enjoy a keg of beer along the shores of Pacific 
Beach. The San Diego City Council approved a one-year ban of all alcohol at city beaches on Nov. 5.

down four towers and two stations 
to assist in stopping the fray. Mace, 
pepper balls and officers in riot gear 
finally quelled the unruly crowd.

Faulconer called the event “an 
embarrassment and a disgrace,” and 
said he never wanted to see such 
behavior again. He has since been 
pushing to prohibit drinking at local 
beaches.

Councilman Tony Young, one of 
the two councilmembers who voted 
against the ban, called the move “dra-
conian” and an “overreaction” to one 
specific incident.

“Most people want to come to the 
beach, have a good time, have a beer 
or not have a beer and not commit the 
terrible acts that opponents are trying 
to portray,” Young said.

He cited the 350,000 people and 
limited law enforcement present on 
Labor Day as other major factors — 
along with alcohol — that contributed 
to the scuffle.

Though similar measures are in 
place up and down the Southern 
California coast, La Jolla is currently 
the only area in San Diego County 
where alcohol consumption is illegal 
24 hours a day.

Mayor Jerry Sanders took mid-
dle ground on the issue, proposing 
that alcohol be barred only on three 
summer holidays: Memorial Day, the 
Fourth of July and Labor Day, when

Scientists at UCSD’s Jacobs 
School of Engineering have devel-
oped a first-of-its-kind computer 
chip that acts as a powerful minia-
ture electronic version of a satellite 
dish, a discovery that could dramat-
ically improve military applications 
such as radar and missile tracking.

The device, called a phased 
array, is a broadcasting or receiv-
ing mechanism that contains many 
small antennas. The signals sent to 
each of these antennas are delayed, 
and their phase is shifted in a specif-
ic pattern that electronically simu-
lates the signal delay of a physically 
curved satellite dish. 

Phased arrays have an advantage 
over normal antennas because they 
can selectively receive or broad-
cast signals in one particular direc-
tion. This decreases interference 
from other signals and increases the 
speed of data exchange. 

The military, which uses phased 
arrays in radar systems, depends 
heavily on the speed at which a 
phased array can electronically 
“swivel.” While tracking a missile, 
for example, there may be no time 
to manually turn an antenna.

The chip represents a revolution 
in phased array technology with 
its unprecedented complexity and 
small size.

Until now, phased arrays had 
mostly been used for military appli-
cations because their size — which 
can be as large as a highway bill-
board — and million-dollar pricetag 
made them impractical for commer-
cial purposes.

Working for about a year, two 
graduate students in the electrical 
and computer engineering depart-
ment, Jason May and Kwang-Jin 
Koh, fit an entire phased array onto 
a single chip. 

Koh, who researches phased 
arrays for his doctoral thesis, was 
drawn to work with phased arrays 
because of the increasing demand 
for commercial applications, which 
was hampered only by the tradition 
of constructing them with many 
separate chips made from high-cost  
semiconductors.

May said that fitting the phased 
array onto one chip makes the

students and parents understand that repayment 
benefits offered by a “preferred lender” may not 
remain intact if the loan is later sold to a different 
lender.

Cuomo also addressed other problematic rela-
tionships between academic institutions and lend-
ing companies, including financial agreements 
between schools and lenders such as revenue shar-
ing, referral fees or reciprocal benefits that were 
kept secret from potential borrowers.

The UCSD Financial Aid Office offers a list 
with eight suggestions for loan companies. Though 
this type of list has been troublesome in the past, 
UCSD Financial Aid Director Vincent De Anda 
said he believes that the variety of lenders on the 
university’s list keeps options open for students 
seeking loans.

“We have done our best to assemble a list of 
lenders that offer stability and the best terms 
and service in the industry,” he said in an e-mail. 
“Additionally, the list contains a mixture of dif-
ferent kind of lenders, so that our students have 
a choice.”

The lenders recommended by UCSD are 
divided into two categories: “tier one” and “tier 
two.” The first, labeled the “preferred lender list,” 
contains three recommended lenders, while the

Tau Beta Pi Wins Most 
Outstanding Chapter

UCSD’s engineering honor soci-
ety, Tau Beta Pi, was recently pre-
sented with the Robert Clayton 
Matthews Most Outstanding 
Chapter Award for its many service 
activities and social events.

Tau Beta Pi continuously strives 
to bring students together and 
encourages interactions with engi-
neering professors through the 
coordination of both on- and off-
campus events. The award is given 
to one Tau Beta Pi chapter out of 
232 chapters across the nation, 
based on the activities that the 
chapters host.

The UCSD chapter, open to the 
top eighth of juniors and top fifth 
of seniors at the Jacobs School of 
Engineering, initiated 94 new mem-
bers and held about 70 events last 
year, many of which were open to 
the entire campus. 

Its various activities included 
teaching engineering and science 
fundamentals to 75 fifth-grade stu-
dents, tutoring fellow UCSD under-
graduates, cleaning local beaches, 
cooking a Thanksgiving dinner for a 
needy local family and helping with 
trail restoration.  

“We were selected not only 
because we hold many events 
throughout the year but also 
because of the quality of our 
events,” Nadia Cheng, last year’s  
Tau Beta Pi president, said in a 
press release.

from some of these companies they 
know nothing about.”

Though UCSD compiles lists 
detailing lenders that it feels will 
provide students with proper loan 
assistance, the Financial Aid Office 
does emphasize that students can 
choose any loan company they 
desire. Presently, UCSD conducts 
business with more than 30 different 
lenders.

The office distributes a letter 
authored by De Anda that explains 
the process behind constructing 
UCSD’s preferred lender lists, and 
informs students that they have every 
right to choose any lender whether 
or not the lender appears on UCSD’s 
preferred lists.

This process helps to avoid a 
problem Cuomo listed as evident in 
the student loan industry — financial 
kickbacks. 

“Lenders pay financial kickbacks 
to schools based on a percentage 
of the loans that are directed to the 
lenders,” Cuomo said. “The kickbacks 
are designed to be larger if a school 
directs more student loans to the 
lender. And the kickbacks are even 
greater if the schools make the lender 
their ‘exclusive’ preferred lender.”

De Anda said that UCSD has no 
financial contracts with any lend-
ers on the preferred list, receives no 
“kickbacks” and does not share any of 
the profits from student loans. 

The new regulations requires that 
colleges ensure that three unaffiliated 
companies are on their lender list, 
and disclose to students the process 
by which these specific loan compa-
nies were chosen.

alcohol is destroying the coastal town’s 
family atmosphere.

The ban will go into effect one 
month after a second council vote 
slated for next week. But considering 
the past, the council’s word may not 
be final.

In 1991, the council approved a 
one-year trial ban that was revoked 

when opponents gathered ample sig-
natures for a referendum. The city 
settled with  proposal that restricted 
drinking between 8 p.m. and noon.

In 2002, the council attempted to 
impose an 18-month, around-the-
clock ban from South Mission Jetty 
to Felspar Street in Pacific Beach.

heavy drinking and disorderly con-
duct are most excessive. However, 
Sanders said that a yearlong ban is too 
far-reaching.

Fifty-year San Diego County res-
ident Joe Rogers pointed to small 
groups of college-age people — gener-
ally from out of town — as the culprits 
who spoil the fun for all involved. He 
mentioned that the traditional Pacific 
Beach block party was permanently 
shut down due to accounts of disor-
derly conduct and public intoxica-
tion.

“The city council has their heads 
up their butts,” Rogers said. “They’ve 
eliminated everything because of a 
few people and that’s not right. Zero 
tolerance is never right.”

Young and other opponents of 
the ban worry that such a rule will 
infringe on the drinking rights of 
residents and remove the liberties that 
make San Diego’s beaches unique.

“People who for years and years 
have enjoyed the beach and have 
drank alcohol responsibly won’t be 
able to do it anymore,” Young said. 
“Some of those privileges will be 
taken away although they have been 
responsible in their actions.”

Other residents have praised the 
motion for addressing concerns that 

device less expensive and more reli-
able, expanding the potential mili-
tary and commercial applications.

According to Gabriel Rebeiz, the 
UCSD electrical engineering pro-
fessor who proposed and oversaw 
the project, the chip breaks many 
world records in its intricacy and 
compact size. 

“No one has ever been able 
to use silicon … to put 16 chan-
nels at this frequency range, with 

excellent amplitude and phase bal-
ance between the channels, and 
with phase control for each chan-
nel,”  Rebeiz said in an e-mail. “No 
one. Not even Raytheon, Boeing or 
Lockheed. No one. This is a first in 
every aspect.”

The team first created a chip that 
could receive signals, and has since 
completed a transmitter.

Some possible commercial uses 
of the chip include being able to 
beam a movie wirelessly between 

certain projectors and DVD players, 
or using it as a small antenna on 
car roofs that would allow access to 
over 500 television channels. 

Rebeiz said he has received posi-
tive feedback regarding the chip’s 
commercial uses.

“Heaven help us, but everyone 
says that this is a great commercial 
application,” he said.

sneaky about it.”

San Diego residents, beer distributors 
and liquor stores, forcing the measure 
onto the ballot, where it was defeated 
by a margin of 3,000 votes.

Rob Rynearson of Pacific Beach, 
a spokesman of FreePB.org, told the 
San Diego Union-Tribune last week 
that members of his group are prepar-
ing to mount a similar referendum.

Police Chief William Landsowne 
said that prohibiting alcohol on 
beaches would simply push the prob-
lem inland to coastal neighborhoods, 
bars or city streets, which may be 
harder to regulate than beaches.

Sixth College senior and Pacific 
Beach resident Sheila Doshi said 
the city should outlaw kegs or other 
devices that lead to binge drinking, 
but doubted that a ban — either per-
manent nor temporary — would stop 
people from drinking.

“I don’t think it will solve the prob-
lems,” Doshi said. “It just means that 
people are going to be more sneaky 
about it.”

The council will vote next week 
after hearing public input. The mea-
sure does not currently require the 
approval of San Diego residents for 
passage.

Get Real, 
Scripted TV 

is So Last 
Season 

If you ask most people about  reality television, chances are  they hate it. Some may go so 
far as to rant about how reality TV 
is ruining our country, poisoning 
our minds and destroying American 
culture and entertainment as we 
know it.  But the truth is, deep 

down, we all indulge in reality TV. 
And many of us have trouble imag-
ining our lives without its simple 
pleasures. 

So what exactly is it that makes 
reality TV so enjoyably addictive? 
From top chefs to top models, real-
ity TV offers something wonderful 
for all of us no matter how diverse 
our interests may be. Here are just a 
few of the reasons why we love it so 
very much:

1. Reality TV introduces us to 
wildly ridiculous and hilarious char-
acters that we would probably never 
associate with in real life. 

Sure, scripted television shows 
are full of funny, quirky, interesting 
people, but what makes reality TV 
stars so much more lovably humor-
ous is the fact that these people 
actually exist. In life, most of us 
probably wouldn’t have anything to 
do with superficial, glamorous teen 
beauty queens who would rather die 
by eating disorder than give up on 
their dreams of becoming models. 

We likely don’t have many friends 
who are desperate enough to humil-
iate themselves on trashy MTV dat-
ing shows with their best friends 
or — better yet — their parents. 
And sadly, most of us aren’t even 
blessed with the privilege of asso-
ciating with ridiculously spoiled, 
overly dramatic rich kids, who, as 
we all know, have much harder lives 

UC’s Closed-Door Policy Muffles Student Voices

By Marissa Blunschi

STUDENT CENTERS AND 
HEALTH — As the popularity of 
medical school continues to grow, 
the UCSD School of Medicine, fol-
lowing suit with similar institutions 
across the country, is beginning to 
substantially expand its class sizes in 
accordance with requests from the 
Association of American Medical 
Colleges. 

But this isn’t necessarily good 
news for UCSD’s flock of eager pre-
med undergraduates. 

Although UCSD’s medical-
school class sizes will be expanding 
up to 30 percent by the year 2015, 

applicants should not feel encour-
aged just yet. Med-school applicants’ 
chances of admission may be signif-
icantly worse in the coming years, 
despite the expansion, because of 
an increasingly competitive medical 
school applicant pool — meaning 
bad news for applicants, but great 
news for the medical schools to 
which they are applying. 

This year, the School of Medicine 
got a head start on its growth plan 
by increasing its number of graduate 
students by 10 percent — accepting 
a whopping 12 additional applicants 
for a total of 134 enrolled students 
out of over 5,000 highly qualified 
candidates. 

This very slight increase in add-
mission does not make much of 
a difference, considering that the 
number of applicants to the medi-
cal school has increased 5 percent 
each of the past five years — mak-
ing enrollment at UCSD continually 
more selective.

This acceptance selectivity is not 
unique to UCSD: With nationwide 

trends in med-school applications 
soaring, the mere 2.3-percent rise in 
enrollment nationwide cannot keep 
up with the 8.2-percent increase 
in eager applicants throughout the 
country. 

So what does this mean for the 
flood of biology majors, Geisel 
library frequenters and Scripps 
Memorial Hospital volunteers who 
dream of one day becoming sur-
geons, anesthesiologists and pedia-

tricians? If one thing is for sure, it’s 
that achieving those dreams is going 
to be much more difficult if current 
applicant and enrollment trends 
continue, particularly because 
both the quantity and quality of 
applicants is increasing drastically. 
According to AAMC, this year’s 
medical school applicants have the 
highest undergraduate grade point 
averages and medical college admis-
sion test scores on record. 

The negative repercussions are 
obvious for applicants: Since the 
rate of qualified applicants is clearly 
overwhelming enrollment rates for 
medical schools, many hardworking 
students will go to great lengths by 
cramming for MCATs, acing their 
courses, volunteering and research-
ing, but still won’t be guaranteed a 
spot at the graduate school of their 
choice. 

Activities and recommenda-
tions that were once used to one-up 
other applicants are now practically 
requirements. Community service 
and straight As are expectations, not 

recommendations, for most presti-
gious medical schools. 

In order to keep up, undergradu-
ates are expected to work even hard-
er if they wish to remain a cut above 
the competition. The activities these 
schools recommend for students to 
become more competitive seem too 
overwhelming to accomplish in a 
24-hour day. 

Fortunately, there are some win-
ners in these unfortunate circum-
stances: Stringent selectivity has 
definite positive repercussions for 
those picky medical schools, at least. 
Since undergraduates are becoming 
increasingly competitive, applicants 
who do get into medical school are 
often well-prepared, having volun-
teered at hospitals or worked hands-
on in research labs.  

Ideally, this should result in a 
generation of highly committed and 
highly skilled future physicians. 
Selectivity  will weed out students 
who may not be fully committed, 

“Although medical-school class sizes at UCSD will be expanding  ... 
applicants should not 

feel encouraged.”

Inflated Classes Won’t Ebb Competition for Med School Applicants
With admission still as 
cutthroat as ever, future 
medical school applicants 
should not feel comforted 
by rising class sizes.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — 
Amid an ongoing battle to polish its 
tarnished reputation, the University 
of California recently absorbed  
another blow from angered students 
who have raised concerns over the 
school’s policy for naming the next 
UC president. 

This time, the UC blunder empha-
sized the severe need for heightened 
student interaction to prevent a trend 
of careless oversight.

According to the UC Student 
Association, the regents have violated 
guidelines set out in their “Policy on 
Appointment of the President of the 
University” by limiting the Student 
Advisory Committee’s participation 
to one meeting with the final presi-
dential candidate. Despite the UCSA’s 
honorable intentions to amplify stu-
dent voices, the UC policy offers little 
support for their argument.

The policy stipulates that the 
Board of Regents is only obligated 
to “present the nominee or nominees 
to members of the [student advi-
sory committee] at the conclusion 
of the search.” Nowhere does 
it promise multiple meetings 
or handsome student input 
in determining UC President 
Robert C. Dynes’ successor, 
making the student claims 
somewhat unfounded.

Even though the UC Office 
of the President’s minimal  stu-
dent-involvement stance may 
be backed by these inhospi-
table policies, it leaves much 
to be desired from university 
officials. 

The regents would actually 
do well to incorporate addi-
tional student participation, 
given their dismal track record 
for making decisions harmful to 
the student experience. After all, 
their chronic closed-door policy 
has led to some of the system’s 
most embarrassing moments 
— let’s not forget 2005’s pay scan-
dals. 

It was without the students’ 
watchful eye that regents care-
lessly approved thousands of 
dollars in above-base-pay for 
the undeserving high-up univer-
sity officials; soon-to-be-replaced 
President Dynes was among that 
wily rat pack. 

Many of the current regents aided 
in Dynes’ selection when former UC 
President Richard Atkinson retired 
in 2003. And though Dynes entered  
the job with lofty aspirations and 
promises for positive change, he will 
no doubt leave it in a state of disar-
ray when he concludes his term next 
June. 

While some of the entropy can be 
attributed solely to Dynes, much of it 
was also aided by an equally under-
performing Board of Regents that 
failed to keep its disobedient leader 
in check. 

Instead, regents watched quietly 
from the wings as Dynes often made 
a mockery of one of the nation’s 
most esteemed public university 
systems. 

Even with the bane of the system 
leaving, there is little confidence to 
be had that the regents will steer us 
back toward the light.  

In fact, in the wake of such blus-
tering mismanagement by UCOP 
and the regents, it’s absurd to think 
that now, only two years after the 

scandals 

— as they still fumble to pick the piec-
es of their infamous fall from grace 
— that they’re capable of selecting 
a reasonable successor. Between its 
dwindling credibility and incurably 
poor judgment, the Board of Regents 
is doomed if it is to select the presiden-
tial nominee without enough student 
advocates to keep it in line.

And so, despite any policy that 
might say otherwise, the regents 
should for once heed the advice of a 
seasoned student body that has seen 
the chaos spawned from an incom-
petent administration. With under-
graduate and graduate education fees 
rising, students can no longer afford 
to finance bureaucratic inefficien-
cies like the ones caused by UCOP, 
which have even led to a $7 

million study into the department’s 
disorganized activities. 

As Dynes’ reign quickly dies, 
the time for change is now — that 
is, if the regents ever hope to sal-
vage their tattered reputation. For 
once, students deserve the voice that 
they have been so unjustly deprived 
by their overbearing, uninspiring 
administration.

than the rest of us. 
Fortunately, with reality TV, 

these characters become our best 
friends and our worst enemies. We 
can get as involved in their insecuri-
ties, competitiveness and drama as 
we’d like without actually having to 
deal with them 24 hours a day. This 
brings me to my next reason for lov-
ing reality TV. 

2. We’re really bored with our 
own lives. 

Let’s face it: we 
all love to pretend 
that our lives are 
incredibly excit-
ing, but some-
times, our day-
to-day college 
experiences seem 
to lack the flavor 
that only reality 
TV can provide. 
With our favor-
ite programs, we 
can live vicari-
ously through the 
exciting lives of 
affluent Beverly 
Hills residents or travel the world in 
search of clues and fabulous prizes. 
I guess that beats writing papers, 
matching socks or rearranging our 
rock collections to avoid studying 
for midterms. 

3. We love the talent (or lack-
there-of). 

Watching average people sing, 
dance, rap, tell jokes, cook or gener-
ally make fools out of themselves is 
definitely entertaining. When con-
testants do have talent, these shows 
can be intriguing, and even inspir-
ing, to the average Joes that wish 
to some day experience those 15 
minutes of fame. When contestants 
frankly have no talent, it’s equally 
enjoyable to laugh at how embar-

rassingly pitiful they are, and then 
make ourselves feel better about our 
own lack of talent.  

4. On some level, we can all relate 
to people on reality TV. 

Even if we don’t demean our-
selves by looking for love in uncon-
ventional places like TV dating 
shows, we’ve all probably felt like 
we would do anything for love. And 
maybe we don’t live fabulous lives in 
ritzy southern California mansions, 
but even the wealthy reality TV stars 

have issues with 
their parents 
and drama with 
their significant 
other or best 
friends. 

And seri-
ously, who of 
us out there 
doesn’t have 
goals or dreams 
that we haven’t 
worked hard to 
achieve? Maybe 
not everyone 
wants to become 
America’s Next 

Top Model, but perhaps there’s a 
little bit of that Top Model ambition 
in each one of us. 

No matter what draws us into 
the guilty pleasure of reality TV, 
one thing is for sure: It’s not going 
anywhere anytime soon. 

So for all of those who haven’t 
hopped on the band wagon yet: 
there’s really no reason to fight the 
urge any longer — go ahead and 
buy the latest season of American 
Idol and prepare a cozy spot on your 
couch, because chances are, you’ll 
be spending some quality time with 
your remote control as long as we 
have reality TV to protect us from 
the harsh realities of our own mun-
dane lives.

and reward those who have dedi-
cated their undergraduate careers 
to hitting the books and sacrific-
ing Saturday-night fun in order to 
study.  

Not only do these dedicated stu-
dents mean good news for medi-
cal schools, but society should 
also benefit significantly from the 
superior doctors that these medical 
schools produce. 

In spite of the unpromising sta-
tistics and ever-increasing competi-
tion, UCSD pre-meds won’t have to 
give up getting into medical school 
entirely. As long as they do extreme-
ly well academically, get fantastic 
GPAs, obscenely high MCAT scores, 

write impressive personal state-
ments, attain research experience, 
have volunteer experience at hospi-

tals and do well on their interviews, 
admission to medical school is vir-
tually guaranteed. Of course, it also 

helps if in addition to that, they have 
spectacular letters of recommen-
dation, community-service activi-
ties and relatives who chair medical 
school admissions committees. 

But even if these unfortunate 
undergraduates don’t get accepted  
to the graduate schools of their  
dreams, they can still rejoice in the 
fact that their future doctors were 
way more competitive than they 
were in college, which obviously 
makes them more qualified and 
dedicated as well. 

At least that’s what everyone 
hopes for.

T he San Diego Zoo — tourist destination, bastion of endangered species — is a locale I’ve returned to repeatedly when 
I get the photographic itch. Even though I’ve 
navigated its network of pathways and exhib-
its enough times to fix them in my memory, 
there is always something to keep me coming 
back. Little things have the 
power to suddenly change 
a disappointing trip into a 
memorable one. Seeing the 
kiwis, for example, made 
my summertime zoo trip 
worthwhile.

With a camera in hand, 
the formula for a satisfy-
ing picture has varied little from visit to visit. 
It involves a lot of walking, finding animals 
that are awake and framing the photo so that 
there are no reflections off the glass or blurry 
remnants of fence. Anything to suggest I didn’t 
venture into the wild to shoot an elusive tigress 
meant I had failed as a photographer. But after 
so many visits, even the catalog of endangered 
species has grown stale. The problem is that 
photos of animals don’t tell my story. As a 
visual document of my experience, my zoo 
photography was lacking.

It took about five visits for this predicament 
to become unbearable, but it was a slow build-
up. I had known all along that, as a biology 
major, my experience at the zoo was different 
than that of the average tourist. I know enough 

about certain species that seeing them in a zoo 
is anticlimactic; seeing animals fenced in and 
forced out of their ecological context is often 
disappointing. In some cases, however, I’ve 
stopped to appreciate a less-popular animal, 
once I’ve learned of some of its history. I real-
ized on a more recent visit that I resented the 

majority of zoo-goers, who 
ignore the more obscure 
species to head straight for 
the popular ones.

They’re called char-
ismatic species. They’re 
cute, cuddly, furry, color-
ful, big or otherwise iden-
tifiable and memorable to 

the common citizen — at least to the extent 
that they stick in the public consciousness 
long enough for an outcry to erupt should they 
warrant a conservation effort. In that way, cha-
risma can make the difference between saving 
a species and losing it to extinction. Because of 
this I have developed an appreciation for how 
other people perceive wildlife. So when I was 
finally tired of focusing my camera on cute 
pandas and ponderous hippopotamuses, it was 
obvious what prey I should switch to.

I went alone on my latest visit to the zoo in 
order to efficiently hunt my new human sub-
jects: the common visitor. They travel in small 
groups, in most cases, with a stroller in tow,

WW hile many factors contribute to feelings of isolation on campus, the physical design of the school bears some responsibility for how we do (or don’t) interact.
Despite conspiracy theories that administrators plan architecture 

to specifically discourage protests, a combination of missteps, bad 
timing and experimental designs are more likely responsible for the 
anti-social architecture that UCSD students intermingle in today.

In “The UCSD Master Plan Study and its Antecedents,” Patricia 
Aquilar, who was the director of physical planning from 1986 to 1993, 
explained that the 1963 architectural blueprint contained principles 
that were to apply to each college, including physical distinctive-
ness, playfields and housing on perimeters and a central court to be 
the focus, suggesting fixed and small areas in which students would 
interact.

According to Aquilar, the construction sprawl that now defines 
UCSD resulted from administrators’ efforts to secure land when a 
declining birthrate caused the city to consider reclaiming some of the 
campus’ land grant.

Increasing the need for space are the multiple colleges inside a uni-
versity system — a factor that changes student interaction.

The 1989 master plan envisioned the colleges as neighborhoods, a 
cohesive space for students to interact within the growing campus.

“…[T]he intent is to provide understandable, human scale physical 
zones within the larger campus land mass,” Aquilar wrote.

Abraham Shragge, the director of Dimensions of Culture at 
Thurgood Marshall College said in his experience, the separate college 
system does not work throughout students’ time at UCSD.

“The separation of colleges gives [students] a sense of commu-
nity for the first two years but by the time they move on they are

Students who happened to pass 
Geisel Library on Nov. 7 saw quite 
an eyeful: large photographs featur-
ing grotesquely distorted and bloody 
limbs, chopped and cut up in an 
array of tiny legs, arms, heads and 
torsos, befitting of any horror film. 
Accompanying the graphic display 
were chalked phrases littering the 
ground that loudly asserted, “If you’re 
pro-choice, you’re for death,” and “real 
women don’t kill babies — some choic-
es are just wrong.” 

Alongside the disturbing posters 
were students dressed in bright red 
t-shirts, holding signs which proudly 
proclaimed, “Fuck you means no, but 
fuck me means yes!” and “My voice 
is pro-choice,” all the while chanting 
messages like “Stand up for choice!” 
and “Girls heart boys who are pro-
choice!” to both students and faculty. 

The radical anti-abortion group 
Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust 
— an off-campus, religiously unaffili-
ated organization — made its biannual 
trip to campus to hold an informative, 
if not disturbing, protest against the 
legalization of abortion. In an effort to 
persuade passers-by to support their 
cause, group members distributed fly-
ers, brochures and handbooks designed 
to inform readers about abortion’s 
dangers (including diagrams dem-
onstrating exactly how abortions are 
executed) and the alternative options 
available to pregnant women.

But when Stephanie Moody-
Geissler, co-president of the pro-
choice student organization Voices for 
Planned Parenthood (or VOX, which 
is Latin for voice), discovered that 
SAH intended to protest at UCSD, she 
immediately coordinated a counter-

presence at the opposite end of Library 
Walk. 

“We don’t want any fights to break 
out or for there to be confrontations 
between the groups, even if it’s tense,” 
said Vanessa Cooney, grassroots coor-
dinator for Planned Parenthood. “We 
just want to let students know that 
we’re an honest on-campus resource 
and that we’re here for them. Planned 
Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside 
Counties is proud of UCSD VOX for 
being a strong pro-choice presence on 
campus.”

VOX is an on-campus group dedi-
cated to informing students about 
reproductive health and choice, and 
has worked to spread sexual toler-
ance and awareness throughout cam-
pus. VOX regularly organizes sev-
eral events throughout the academic 
year, including information tables on 
Library Walk, free movie screenings 
of reproductive health films and the 
annual Sextravaganza, a fair focused 
on issues of sexual health. The group 
also passes out holiday-themed con-
doms throughout the year and cel-
ebrates the anniversary of Supreme 
Court case Roe v. Wade during the first 
week of January. 

Last year, SAH visited UCSD as 
part of its Southern California college 
and high school campus tour in order 
to sponsor their message. 

“They came last year during spring 
quarter, and we had no idea that they 
would be on campus, but earlier in 
the year we had decided on a plan of 
action in case an anti-abortion group 
decided to show up” Moody-Geissler 
said. “Within minutes of a VOX mem-

more interested in their departments,” 
Shragge said. 

Kim Yu, the senior resident advi-
sor at Revelle, pointed to the conflict-
ing college-oriented architecture and 
a university spirit pushed by athletics 
as factors that pull students in different 
directions.  

“Of course we are failing at having 
a big community but we are also failing 
at small community; we need to decide 
which we are going for,” Yu said.

UCSD came of age in the tumultu-
ous late-’60s culture; which manifested 
itself on campus in the form of stu-
dent protests and shaped how officials 
would view future building projects.

Indeed, Revelle and John Muir 
College designs are the most cohe-
sive and compact campuses of UCSD’s 
six; the two were built first. However, 
according to Aquilar’s book, at the time 
Thurgood Marshall College was con-
structed, its isolated design was based 
on the assumption that the students 
would be difficult to regulate.  

“Believing the college would be 
dominated by radical ‘third world’ stu-
dents, many at UCSD did not want 
it ‘in my backyard’ or in the center of 
campus,” Aquilar wrote.

But beyond issues stemming from 
the university’s design, students are 

isolated in La Jolla due to the lack of 
student-oriented centers in walking 
distance. 

While Price Center attempts to cre-
ate a nonacademic social space for 
students, the suggestion that crowd 
control was a factor in its initial design 
is plausible. The stairs are narrow and 
angled, making it hard for more than 
two students to walk together. The few 
avenues of entry into the plaza are easy 
to block, lead into a lowered area that 
is easily observable and, if needed, con-
trollable from the second floor.

In contrast, Student Center, con-
structed in early 1960s, boasts a design 
more conducive to social activities, 
built without concern of possible stu-
dent gatherings.

Some students are leery of the Price 
Center expansion, but its architect, 
Mehrdad Yazdani, emphasized that 
student representatives have taken a 
very active part in the planning of Price 
Center Expansion. He added that those 
representatives are vocal in making and 
vetoing decisions regarding the archi-
tecture and how the space will be used.

Yazdani said that students’ experi-
ences with Price Center and the rest 
of campus influenced their decisions 
in what was needed in the expansion. 
The indoor atrium, for example, was 
created specifically to give students an 

indoor space when the plaza in Price 
Center gets too cold in the evening. 

Despite persistent rumors of Price 
Center’s design to ease crowd control, 
Yazdani dismissed the notion that the 
expansion was built with those con-
siderations.

“That was never a topic of discus-
sion, and never brought up to me,” 
Yazdani said.

Graduate student Ben Balthasar con-
tended that if crowd control was consid-
ered, it would not have been mentioned.

“Mike Davis [author of “Fortress 
L.A.”] wrote about how architects open-
ly talk about surveillance and crowd 
control for places like Bloomingdales 
but when a very similar design gets 
brought in to campuses they don’t talk 
about it,” Balthasar said. “It would be 
politically problematic to mention it.”

Aside from concerns of secret 
motives, there are other issues raised 
with the construction of a largely 
indoor, metal and glass structure on 
what used to be open spaces with low, 
bungalow-like offices. Adjunct profes-
sor of literature Mike Grattan said 
construction should not substitute for 
real institutional changes.

“It’s the old mantra, ‘if you build 
it they will come,’ but honestly to me 
its like throwing a bright new toy to 
your kid and saying ‘go play with your 

friends,’” Grattan said. 
Alumnus Derek Lomas taught 

“Social Architecture,” a Sixth College 
practicum course that had students cre-
ating art pieces Lomas called “interven-
tional construction.” Three of the stu-
dents constructed the labyrinth housed 
in the Eucalyptus grove last June.

Lomas said the labyrinth space was 
more compact and set up for social 
interactions, compared to the large 
empty spaces peppered throughout the 
campus.

“The library had tons of space, is 
in the center of campus, and no one 
uses it ... more benches and differ-
ent landscapes could make the space 
more sociable,” Lomas said. “The cli-
mate allows for students to be outside 
almost everyday but there are no out-
door central spots.”

Whether the administration has 
ulterior motives in designing a space 
in which UCSD students can’t fully 
interact, the consequences of poor 
design will be felt for the generations 
of students to come.

“The question I would have to ask 
is if you were really trying to create a 
social space, would it really look like 
this?” Balthasar said.

ber noticing [SAH], our plan was put 
into effect and an impromptu counter-
presence occurred,” 

Whether improvised or not, the 
presence of VOX members countering 
normally tense SAH protests did not 
go unnoticed by students. 

“When I saw the disgusting images 
that SAH showed, it was shocking,” 
John Muir College sophomore Lina 
Dajani said. “No one wants to see that. 
But I felt more comfortable with the 
student organization, because their 
information was easier to handle and 
to trust. People were even avoiding 
eye-contact with SAH, but didn’t mind 
approaching VOX.”

Moody-Geissler agreed that SAH’s 
literature and presentation was a little 
hard to swallow. 

“[The posters] serve no purpose 
but to be used for their shock value,” 
she said. “[SAH is] not just content 
with presenting its side of the debate 
over choice, it has decided to falsify 
information or use other material that 
is in no way backed by the scien-
tific community. We were not going 
to stand by idly and let these lies be 
spread on our campus.” 

Kortney Blythe, the SAH campus 
life tour director, believes that the 
posters and images her organization 
used are nothing different from those 
depicted during the Vietnam War. 

“Graphic images have been used 
throughout history to fight injustice,” 
she said. “Civil rights activists used 
pictures. We live in a visual society. 
And for that matter, this is a procedure 
that is legal and happens 4,000 times a 
day in our country. Why do people get 
so offended at pictures of it? If it’s too 
hard to look at, maybe we shouldn’t be 
tolerating it.”

Some students did find the anti-
abortion material to be informative 
and eye-catching.

“I’m against abortion; for me, 
there’s no way to justify sacrificing 
life for one girl’s night of pleasure,” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College freshman 
Sarah Figueroa said. “This group 
wants to spread that message. People 
are entitled to their own opinion, 
though, so the pro-life group can say 
what it wants.”

VOX members alleged that SAH 
broke several campus procedural rules 
during their protest, including their 
location directly in front of the library 
and their use of a table, and contacted 
Judicial Affairs to report the viola-
tions. Although university personnel 
later came to investigate the reports, 
no complaints were officially filed. 

“We understand that the univer-
sity may have its own rules about free 
speech,” Blythe said. “But we follow 
the first amendment, and that states 
that we are allowed to assemble on 
all public spaces. We promote free-
speech advocacy — otherwise, both 
ourselves and the pro-choice groups 
could not demonstrate.”

Blythe said that although SAH 
does assemble at high schools, it pro-
tects the rights of minors by remaining 
on public sidewalks and offcampus. 
She also noted that while she has led 
protests at more than 260 schools dur-
ing her term as director, there have 
only been five arrests due to trespass-
ing charges. 

But Moody-Geissler found the 
groups disregard for campus policies 
to be aggravating, and believes its pres-
ence on campus did little to further 
its cause. 

“It is not appropriate for a non-
affiliated group to disregard policies 
that other groups that are affiliated 
with the campus are required follow,” 
she said. “In the end, [SAH] being 
on campus only brought more people 
over to the VOX counter-presence for 
information and to give us support. 
We almost doubled our e-mail list in 
just one day.”

and are incredibly abundant.
The inside of the zoo hadn’t 

changed much between visits — a 
maze of sloping pathways and simu-
lated habitat, designed to transport 
throngs of stroller-pushing visitors 
to far-away lands and keep the spec-
imens at ease. But with my mind 
off the animals themselves, I was 
more open to my immediate sur-
roundings.

 I took notice of what people 
look for and what they miss. For 
example, in front of an exhibit full 
of beautiful African fish, I watched 
a man blink a few times into the 
murky water and mutter with a 
gloomy Southern twang, “There’s 
nothing in here.”

I wondered what he was looking 

for, and I got hints throughout the 
day. At the gorillas, a female car-
rying its infant spurred a woman 
to gush, “See the mom and the 
baby hugging?” At the reptile house, 
a small boy gleefully announced, 
“There’s a daddy one!” The meer-
kats prompted a mother to ask her 
daughter, “Do you remember them 
from the ‘Lion King’?” An over-
weight woman frowned at the hip-
popotamuses and remarked, “God, 
what a big ol’ butt.”

By the time a woman bluntly rec-
ognized an echidna as a porcupine, 
I got the strong impression that if 
she had known it was an echidna 
beforehand she would have been 
less excited. A thousand little com-
ments like this convinced me how a 
lot of an animal’s appeal comes from 

the visitor drawing on their own 
lives, what’s in their memories and 
what’s important to them.

I appreciated this rather than 
disdained it, because I was treating 
the other visitors the same way they 
were treating the animals. As a pho-
tographer, I don’t know much about 
the strangers I pass, but I can attach 
my own story to them. If a photo-
graph catches something that lets a 
viewer do the same, it’s likely to be 
successful. It was certainly intrigu-
ing to think of how the animals 
function in the same way for a lot of 
people, and how much they are like 
works of art.

in the back of my mind I was hoping 
and praying that the ball would just 
sail past the goal,” Zatarain said. “It was 
heartbreaking, especially for the seniors. 
I can’t even imagine how the seniors 
feel, it’s horrible to think about what it 
means to them. We played a good game 
of soccer but when it comes down to it 
that one moment changes everything 
and after that you don’t get a second 
chance.”

As one of the team’s main veteran 
leaders, the career-ending loss cut espe-
cially deep for midfielder Lai.

“It sucks, especially losing to our big-
gest rivals,” Lai said. “Everybody expects 
us to go farther than the first round and 
so the loss was really hard. It’s good that 

there are so many seniors on our team 
to support each other because we are all 
going through this together.”

In addition to Lai, the Tritons will lose 
seniors Alie Avina, Chelsey Campbell, 
Stacy Johnson, Rachel Lindenfeld, 
Nicole Pepper, Caitlin Ryan, Lauren 
Segars and Kathy Sepulveda. McManus 
expressed his pride and admiration for 
his seniors’ leadership and his team’s 
achievement and determination.

“For what the team has done with 
all of the injuries, no other team in the 
conference or the whole country could 
have done,” McManus said. “This team 
was the probably one of the biggest 
achieving teams that we have ever had 
at UCSD. To do what they did was 
unbelievable.”

and the Seawolves opened up a com-
fortable seven-point advantage and 
cruised to the game three win.

In a do-or-die game four, neither 
team gained any advantage, with 
the largest lead totaling four points. 
UCSD played from behind for the 
game’s first half, capturing its first 
lead at 15-14.

Coming out of a timeout, Schmidt 
served up back-to-back aces to give 
the Tritons a 23-19 advantage. The 
Seawolves wouldn’t go anywhere, 
fighting back to tie the game for the 
11th time — at 25. The two teams 
traded points until UCSD earned a 
game point opportunity. 

Sonoma State promptly called a 
timeout to ice Carpenter on the ser-
vice line, but after a Schmidt kill, 
the Tritons forced game five, their 
fourth consecutive five-game match.

“Black just told us to stay in the 
moment,” senior captain and libero 
Natalie Facchini said. “We were in a 
good position with game point and 
confident that if we made it to a fifth 
game we could win.”

Down 4-1 early, UCSD came 
back from a timeout firing, tying up 
the game at 4-4. Bailey tallied three 
of her game-high 29 kills as the 
Tritons began to pull away from the 
pesky Seawolves, eventually grab-
bing another win.

Following emotional pre-game 
introductions and a cheer by the 
players’ parents on Senior Night, 
UCSD faced off against the Sea 
Otters on Nov. 10 in front of a bois-
terous Triton Tide.

“The night was really emotional 
for me,” senior outside hitter Casey 
Wilson said. “It really started to hit 
me on my way over here and was 
a mix of happy and sad. When the 
crowd started singing the national 
anthem, my emotions really got to 
me but I was ready to play.”

The Tritons were in control from 

the beginning, and their potent 
offense proved too much for the Sea 
Otter defense as Bailey, Schmidt and 
Wilson all finished with double digit 
kills in the three-game rout.

Getting off to a good start was 
something UCSD failed to do in 
previous weeks but wasn’t a problem 
against the Sea Otters. 

“We really put it together tonight 
and during the second half of the sea-

son,” Wilson said. “This team has a 
heart and fire like few others that will 
make us contenders during playoffs.”

With elite competition looming, 
the team plans to work hard on the 
fundamentals that have gotten it this 
far, and the Tritons hope their work 
will pay off when they face sixth-seed 
Northwest Nazarene University on 
Nov. 15 to kick off the NCAA Pacific 
Regional.

team with a winning record in 2006.
While the Chargers should be 

ashamed of their play so far and embar-
rassed to be a division leader, all is not 
lost. They are a far cry from their 2006 
edition that cruised to a 14-2 record, 
but the Chargers can still hold out hope 
that they will turn things around. No 
matter what the quality of their wins 
has been, the Chargers are still one of 
the best teams, talent-wise, of any in 
the NFL. Sure, the Patriots are execut-
ing to perfection, but the Chargers 
still boast a better running back, the 
best tight end in the game, a young 
quarterback that has proven himself 
capable of putting together game-win-
ning drives (although you have to look 
all the way back to last season) and a 
stifling defense. 

The problem so far has been consis-

tency. Whenever L.T. breaks out, Rivers 
negates it with some costly turnovers. 
Or when Rivers starts to get a rhythm 
going, L.T. suddenly finds himself 
swarmed at the line and incapable of 
setting up some long scoring plays. 
If Tomlinson, Rivers, Gates and the 
defense can all start contributing con-
sistently and the Chargers begin run-
ning on all cylinders, they could be a 
dangerous team come playoff time. But 
until Norv Turner sparks something 
in the squad to turn things around, 
this team will remain an inconsistent 
disappointment destined for no more 
than a measly playoff appearance. And 
after last year’s collapse, San Diegans 
are expecting more than just an appear-
ance; they want nothing less than a 
chance to pay the Patriots back for last 
year’s contest on the way to a long-over-
due Super Bowl win.

HOT CORNER

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2007

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

After starting the season 10-0-1, 
an onslaught of injuries blindsided the 
UCSD women’s soccer team, and the 
Tritons were never able to fully recov-
er, culminating in a 2-1 loss to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills at the  NCAA 
Division II National Championship 
regionals on Nov. 8. The heartbreak-
ing overtime defeat ended the Tritons’ 
season, which at one point had UCSD 
ranked as the country’s No. 2 team. 

In a twist of ironic cruelty, it was 
the Cal State Dominguez Hill Toros 
that helped start the Tritons’ late-season 
slide. On Oct. 10, the Toros dealt UCSD 
its first loss, a 1-0 shutout at Triton 
Soccer Stadium. The Tritons would go 
on to win only two of their next five 
games, ending with the regional loss 
in Seattle.

The injuries took an unprecedented 
toll on the Tritons throughout the year, 
even forcing them to start the season 
short a few players. Toward the end of 
the year, more and more players joined 
the ranks on injured reserve, but the 
resilient Tritons pushed through all the 
way to the end.

 “We were probably the only team 
with a starting lineup that had never 
played together for the whole season,” 
head coach Brian McManus said. 
“From the beginning of the season we 
always had at least two injured starters. 
It’s amazing that our planned starting 
11 never played together.” 

During the regular season, CSUDH 
won the series with a 0-0 draw and a 
1-0 victory. Ever since UCSD moved 
to Division II, the in-conference rivalry 
that the Tritons have developed with 
the Toros has reached epic proportions, 

making every meeting between the two 
teams all the more heated.

On Nov. 8, it was again Dominguez 
Hills that drew first blood, with the 
Toros’ senior midfielder Amy Livergood 
netting the game’s first goal in the 20th 
minute. The Tritons, who scored 31 
total goals on the season, were held 
scoreless for the remainder of the first 
half. After regrouping during halftime, 
UCSD came out of the gates strong 
and in the 67th minute, junior forward 
Natasha Belak-Berger scored the equal-
izing goal on a shot that found the upper 
right corner 
of the net. 
The goal was 
Belak-Berger’s 
seventh of the 
year and was 
assisted by 
senior midfielder Ali Lai, her second 
assist this season. 

Neither team was able to push across 
a game-winning goal for the rest of reg-
ulation play, sending the already tense 
game into an exhilarating overtime 
period. With 1:10 left in the first over-
time period, Dominguez Hills junior 
forward Yvonne Vasquez sent a dagger 
through the heart of the Triton faithful 
with a goal that just passed through the 
diving hands of junior keeper Jessica 
McGovern. The goal would prove to 
be the game winner, with the Tritons 
unable to score in the final minute. 

Sophomore midfielder Alexia 
Zatarain was stunned when the game-
winning shot took the air. And when 
it swooshed into the back of the net, 
she became all too aware of the goal’s 
consequences.

“I saw the ball go up in the air and

RIMAC Arena and the Triton 
faithful will bid adieu to the five 
graduating seniors on the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team after two 
must-win games on Nov. 9 and Nov. 
10. UCSD avenged an earlier loss to 
Sonoma State by capturing a five-
game thriller on Nov. 9, 23-30, 30-
22, 22-30, 30-28, 15-11, and the 
team returned Nov. 10 and disposed 
of Cal State Monterey Bay 30-20, 
30-19, 30-19.

UCSD finished the regular sea-
son 19-7 overall and 13-5 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, and with their second-
place finish in the conference, the 
Tritons earned the third seed in 
the NCAA Pacific Regional, which 
begins Nov. 15 at Cal State San 
Bernardino. The Tritons were one of 
five CCAA teams to make the eight-
team regional, showing the depth 
and difficulty of the conference. 

Head coach Tom Black said he 
knows that the playoff competi-
tion is at an even higher level than 
the regular season, but believes the 
momentum the team built during 
its last two home matches will carry 
over.

“This was a big weekend for us,” 
he said. “I’m happy for the seniors 
and I feel like we’re in a good spot 
right now. We’re just going to contin-
ue working on the things we always 
work on.”

Before playoff banter and predic-
tions could start, UCSD had to take 
care of business against conference 
foe Sonoma State. In a contest that 
began similarly to the teams’ Oct. 6 
matchup, the Seawolves took game 
one, with the Tritons bouncing back 
to take game two. However, unlike 
the match in early October in which 

Sonoma State ran away with a 1-3 
win, this time UCSD emerged vic-
toriously.

Junior captain and outside hitter 
Rebecca Bailey admitted that the 
Triton squad underestimated the 
Seawolves during their first meet-
ing, but UCSD looked focused and 
ready to play after a slow start in 
game one.

The Triton defense was deflated 
in the first game, with digs and ser-
vice returns seemingly going every-
where but to the setter. Without 
good passing, senior setter Kim 
Adams and her hitters had difficulty 
finding any offensive rhythm.

A two-point spread was the clos-
est UCSD came in game one, and 
Sonoma State closed out the open-
ing round on three Triton hitting 
errors. 

The Tritons started to find their 
swagger in game two, earning their 
first lead of the match 9-8, following 
a block from junior outside hitter 
Kimberly Carpenter. Carpenter con-
tinued at a torrid pace, giving UCSD 
a 12-9 advantage. 

Sonoma State wouldn’t allow the 
Tritons to pull too far ahead, fighting 
back after every UCSD run. But it 
wasn’t enough down the stretch, and 
the Tritons began to find the offense 
they lacked in game one. Sophomore 
outside hitter Sylvia Schmidt, Bailey 
and senior middle blocker Hannah 
Gary all got in on the action as the 
Tritons tied the match at one game 
apiece.

Down 9-17, UCSD found itself in 
another deep hole in game three and 
promptly called a timeout. Bailey 
rallied the troops with a couple of 
kills as the Tritons moved within 
four points. But slow feet and poor 
defense from game one resurfaced, 

Late Win Streak Lifts UCSD into Playoffs

The San Diego Chargers are perched precariously atop the AFC West with a disappoint-
ing 5-4 record as the team powers into 
the stretch run of the NFL season. 
Although it seems cynical to criticize 
a division-leading team, the Bolts don’t 
deserve to be where they are today. 
With the way the Chargers have been 
playing, they are lucky to even be sniff-
ing the playoffs. But because of the 
appalling play of their division “rivals,” 
the Chargers look destined to repeat 
their last season: a first-round exit at the 
hands of any number of superior teams 
like the Patriots, Steelers or Colts.

I know some of you diehard 
Charger fans out there will point to San 
Diego’s 23-21 win over the defending 
Super Bowl champions in Week 10 as 
evidence of the team’s perseverance 
and ability to contend with some of 
the other conference powerhouses. But 
let me ask you this: If these teams met 
again next week, do you think the 
Chargers could intercept six of Peyton 
Manning’s passes or have their special 
teams unit account for 14 points? The 
obvious answer is no, but without these 
once-in-a-blue-moon, hell freezes over, 
pigs-flying type-moments, the Chargers 
would be 4-5, though amazingly still 
tied for first in the AFC West.

To truly comprehend how improb-
able this latest Charger win was, 
one must understand that Antonio 
Cromartie, the cornerback responsible 
for Manning’s misery — three picks in 
the first half — was making his very 
first NFL start filling in for injured vet-
eran Quentin Jammer. Or consider this: 
The 89-yard opening kickoff return 
touchdown and 45-yard punt return 
touchdown were third-year, third-
string running back Darren Sproles’ 
first and second career touchdowns. It 
was the combination of Cromartie and 
Sproles that vaulted San Diego to a 23-7 
halftime score that remained until the 
final frame, a comfortable fourth-quar-
ter lead for any competitive club.

Instead of coming out in the sec-
ond half and never looking back, the 
Chargers ended up having to nervously 
watch Manning chip their lead away 
with a passing touchdown and a two-
point conversion to bring the Colts 
within another trip to the end-zone and 
two-point conversion. With the best 
running back in the NFL in LaDainian 
Tomlinson, the Chargers should have 
had no problem running the clock out, 
but instead the ball ended up in Phillip 
Rivers’ iron hands, which fumbled the 
rock into the end zone, where it was 
recovered by Indy’s middle linebacker 
Gary Brackett for six more points. The 
two-point conversion failed, leaving 
San Diego clinging to a 23-21 win.

Although there were plenty of 
shocking moments leading up to the 
win, none were more important or 
more improbable then Adam Vinatieri, 
easily the best clutch-kicker of all-time, 
missing a 29-yard field goal that would 
have given the Colts the lead with only 
a minute and a half left in the game. 
Once the ball sailed just a smidge to the 
right of the upright, the Chargers could 
finally celebrate their first victory over a
