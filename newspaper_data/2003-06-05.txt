By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A. . Council approved 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher's 
Executive Budget for the 2003-04 
school year wi th a vote of 17 -0-1 , on 
June 4. 

"I'm happy WIth the way it turned 
out,» Gallagher said after the final 
vote. "I think thi is the stm of 
something that can produce a lot of 
change and really affect the campus. 
I promise to continue doing that." 

Three separate budget meetings, 
totaling over 14 hours in length, pre-
ceded debate on the council floor. 
All budget meetings were open for 
public comment. 

Debate on the council floor cen-
tered on increasing funding for the 
Student-Initiated Outreach and 
Recruitment COlruni ion. 

Nam Bui, theJohn Muir College 
sophomore senator, moved to reallo-
cate $5,000 from the 
Culturall Awareness Program 
Unallocated line item to SIORC. 
The amendment passed, 13-3-2. 

Also, Commissioner of Student 
Serviccs Kelly Vasant reported that a 
sponsorship arrangement for the 
Triton laxi ervice may allow more 
money to be funneled to SIORC. 

At a June 2 budget meeting, 
items of contention included fund-
ing for SIORC, changes in council 
members' lipend, as well as fund-
ing for A.S. programming and the 
Academic ucccss Program. 

At a budget meeting on June 2, 
External Vice- hair of the tudent 
Mfirmative Action 'oalinon Rigo 
Marquez urged the council to 
increase funding for SIORC. 

"Where are our priori lie '" 
Marquez saId. "We're the lea t 
diverse of the Cs. 'fhe programs 
that we're putting on are to increase 
the diverSity of our campus." 

SrORC receivcs funding from 
the state through the Office of 

tudent Affairs. A collibinanon of 
ute-level budget cuts as well as 

dccrea! cd allocations from the vice 
chancellor' office have led to a large 

decrea~e in funds from previolls 
years. 

Marquez and a handful of up-
porte~ requcst thal an additional 
$ 12,1 00 be allocated to I RC to

Publication incites 
reproach from A.S. 
Council, Watson condemn 

'hateful' depiction of muslims 
By GAEW FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

A publication entitled "Jizzlam, 
An Entertainment Magazine For 
the I lamic Man" was distributed 
at UCSD on June 4, eliciting 
strong reactions from the campus 
community, including a letter 
addressed (0 the UCSD communi-
ty from Vice hancellor of tudent 
Affairs Joseph Wats n, calling the 
publication "deplorable," a resolu-
tion pa ed by the A.S. ouncil at 
its meeting late in the evening of 
June 4 condemning the publication 
and other "recreationa.1 hate," and 
numerous reactions from Muslim 
students during the public input 
section of the meeting. 

The 16-page publication, 
which was indicated as "Volume 
63, Issue 2," did not identify the 
authors or the organization 
responsible. 

"Of course that was the Koala," 
said Jeremy Rode, who served as a 
principal member to the Koala last 
year and said he "hangs around the 

office" now that he is a graduate 
student. "It's just another Koala. 
Who else would do that?" 

A first draft of a resolution 
drafted as emergency legislation 
prior to the A.S. Council meeting 
was removed from the agenda after 
being rejected by the internal com-
mittee. This decision prompted 
over a dozen Muslim students and 
members of the Muslim Student 
Association to urge the council to 
reconsider. 

"The woman on the cover, she 
was covered from head to toe just 
the way I am," said MSA member 
Muslema Purmul. "If you !mew 
how hard it is for the Muslim sis-
ters to be walking around campus 
today, you'd be shocked." 

The version of the rcsolution 
was reintroduced to the council 
and passed 13-2-3 after multiple 
amendments to wording pointing 
to a "continuing problem of recre-
ational hate this past academic 
year," reaffirmed the council's

Revelle holds thir~-eighth 
watermelon drop 

The 38th annual watermelon drop will be 
held June 4 to mark the end of the year and 
will be followed by Revelle College Provost F. 
Thomas Bond's retirement party. The event is 
a Revelle College tradition that began in 
1965. Bob Swanson, a professor of physics, 
had as ed hiS Revelle all-freshman class: "If a 
watermelon was dropped from a 7-story 
building. where would the farthest piece 
land! and "What would be the velocity on 
Impact of the watermelon')" Every year, stu-
dents try 0 answer that question by chOOSing 
a 'Watermelon Queen" to drop a watermelon 
from Urey Hall. 

Following the event, Bond will hold hiS 
retirement party, marking the end of 20 years 
as the provost of Revelle College. 

School of Medicine heads 
study on schizophrenia 
A $20 million grant was recently awarded to 

a conSOrbum of seven academiC research cen-
ters, led by the UCSD School of Medicine, to 
study the ~enes that cause specific behavioral 
abnormalities found in schizophrenia patients. 

The grant will be distributed by UCSD 
amongst research centers in HalVard, Mt Sinai 
School of Medicine, UClA, University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center, University of 
Pennsylvania and University of Washington, 
Seattle. 

Research under this grant will focus on 
specific genetic abnormalities that occur in 
schizophreniC patlents, rather than the broad 
area of the disease's genetics. 

The five-year grant, awarded by the 
National Institute of Mental Health, will allow 
researchers to study specific traits or phYSIO-
logical markers distinctive to schizophrenics 
and their family members who are unaffected 
by the disease. 

"Because we'd be able to Identify genes, a 
fundional genetic aprroach and understand 
abnormal funcbon 0 these genes, we'll be 
able to aim treatment to most funcbons areas 
of brain and the receptors it involves: Braff 
said. 'It Will be used to tailor treatments to a 
type of deficit'

Seniors: Soon;to;be graduates take 
steps towards a job or grad school 

continued from page I 
ti"e, and tudents need to understand that its 
competitive." 

The job market has been described as being 
in the wor t slwnp in 20 years. 

Over the past year, the Career ervices 
Center wimessed decreases in on-cam pus 
interviewing as well as a five percent decrease 
in the number of employers participating in job 
fairs and a 15 percent decrease in the number 
of fujI- time job listings. 

For Julia Houck- Whitaker, who graduated 
from Revelle College after Winter 2003, both 
the economy and a frui tlcss job search has 
forced this cognitive science major to declare 
the unexpected - retirement. 

"I've been forced into retirement by the job 
market," she said. 

Houck- Whitaker said that since graduating 
in larch, she has applied to numcrous JObs in 
ficld; ranging from financc to Web develop-
mem. 

"It's a rough job market, l\·c learned o,er 
the pa;t year," she said. 

Average srarung incomes are slighdy less 
than lhose offered to graduates last ycar, 
although Sclunidt noted that thb ycars prelim-
inary numbers reflect incomes offered ro tu-
dents who acovcly sought jobs earl), on, includ-
ing a computer ;Ocnce rudent I'no will be 
starting at Q ALCO,\L\1 for 60,000 a year, 
and another engmeering rudent ,vho will be 
carrung 57,000 as a software engineer. 

ctaviano Rios, a Thurgood Marshall 
College senior, is looking for a management or 
administrative job for local government in Los 
Angeles. Despite ha\~ng mree years worlcing 
experience in government, the political science 
major said mat his job choices are limited by 
the economy. 

"I see differences in opportunities - just 
lower, lower opponunities in the public ec-
tor," Rios said. "That's just based on the 
career." 

Although he used resources at the Career 
Services Center, he said the job offerinl,'s seem 
mainly limited to San Diego. 

"If I want to pursue other opportunities 
outside of [San Diego), I'd have to do that on 
my own," Rios said. "But I'm sti ll eying, so I'm 
going to go back and see what mey can help me 
with." 

For those seniors who applied and were 
accepted to graduate and professional schools, 
prospects inunediately following graduation 
look brighter. Programs in law, business and 
teacher education have become increasingly 
popular since last year, chmidt said. 

Christine Mahfouz, a Revelle College 
enior, is enroll ing in an urban planning and 

law dual-dcgrec program at CL. he sa id 
although she plaruled on postbaccalaurcate 
sttldy, she attempted to brave the job market. 

"My origmal intent was to get into grad 
school or law school , but I wa; worned th'lt [ 
wouldn't gct in," she sa id. "I started trying to 
find johs and ;l11ff, bur I couldn't lind ;I loh

GSA resolution opposes 
USA Patriot Act 

Grad students follow suit of 
112 cities opposing the act 

Unions, UC reach agreement 
Tentative contract ends negotiations 

By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Graduate Student 
Association unanimously passed a 
resolution to oppose the USA 
Patriot Act on June 2. The resolu-
tion, which was authored and 
introduced to the council by GSA 
representative Kenny Burch and 
graduate student Omar Clay, 
opposes the Patriot Act due to the 
impact it has had on the graduate 
and research community at both 
the university and nationwide level. 

The act, passed after 9/ I I , 
sought to broadens the govern-
ment's power to investigate and 
prevent terrorist activities. 

Burch, a GSA representative 
from the physics department, said he 
was motivated to write the resolu-
tion after hearing about instances of 
problems created for international 
srudentS after the passage of the act. 

"A number of foreign students 
in my department have been hav-
ing trouble due to the passage of 
the Patriot Act," Burch said. "For 
example, people have gone home 
for visits of about a week and end 
up getting detained there for as 
long as two months because they 
have trouble getting visas. If you're 
a graduate srudent, that significant-
ly delays your research." 

Burch said he initially 
re earched the information and ser-
vice UCSD offered to students 
regarding the Patriot Act and found 
no information, which concerned 
him because he felt it was "not clear 

how the university is or is not 
responding to the Patriot Act." 

This, he said, prompted him to 
write the resolution, aslcing the uni-
versity administration "engage and 
participate in community dialogue 
on civil liberties issues, in order to 
promote tile safety and well-being 
of the UCSD community," and that 
it "recognize the commitment it 
has to uphold the legal and human 
rights of all UC students." 

The resolution also speaks out 
against portions of the Patriot Act 
that allow for governmental intru-
sion into what was formerly con-
sidered private information, such 
as library and academic records, 
without requiring notification of 
the individual whose records are 
being examined. 

The GSA is not the first organi-
zation to pass a resolution against 
the USA Patriot Act. The resolu-
tion cites "over 112 cities and 
counties from around the country 
... [that) have passed similar reso-
lutions reinforcing local efforts to 
support and defend legal and 
human rights of their residentS." 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Sophomore Senator Max 
Harrington said that he is consid-
ering introducing a similar resolu-
tion to the A.S. Council next year. 

"IBurch) felt that it would get 
the issue on the radar screen and 
open up a dialogue with the admin-
istration," Harrington said. "I 
think that the resolution was great, 
but I'd like to see any A.S. resolu-
tion address specific violations." 

By GAEUE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

After over three years of nego-
tiations with its lecturers and one 
year of negotiations with its pro-
fessional and technical employees, 
the University of California 
announced that tentative contracts 
had been reached wi th both 
employees' unions on May 29. 

According to UC spokesperson 
Paul Schwartz, the University of 
California's current budget diffi -
culties were one factor that led to 
the resolution of the two separate 
agreements at the same time. 

"The unions had come to grips 
with the fact that there was not 
going to be significant change 
with respect to wages at this time," 
Schwartz said. 

The tentative contract between 
the University of California and 
the University Council-American 
Federation of Teachers, which rep-
resents approximately 1,600 UC 
lecturers, raises base salaries for 
lecturers, who have been worlcing 
for less than six years, from the cur-
rent $27,000 to $37,000 by 2005. 

The contract also features bet-
ter wording to the effect of improv-
ing job security for lecrurers with 
six years or more of experience. 

According to local UC-AFT 
President and visual arts professor 
Fred Lonidier, security for lecturers 
below the six-year mark - which is 
when they are up for review by the 
university - has been a problem 
both at UCSD and at a system-wide 
level. Until the six-year review, at 
which time academic departmentS 
have had to decide whether to re-
hire the lecturer with some level of 
increased security, lecturers were 

only guaranteed to be rehired on a 
quarter-by-quarter basis, regardless 
of the number of years they had 
been working or of their perfor-
mance. 

"Some departments ha ve a pol-
icy that basically said that they like 
new blood, so often they would 
only hire lecturers for about two 
years," Lon idier said . "Some 
departments would renew people 
for three of four years but would-
n't renew them for a fifth because 
they would not want them to 
reach that ixth year." 

Lonidier said that while many 
firing cases iJlustratingthis scenario 
were brought against the university 
and won by the union, the issue had 
been brought to the bargaining 
table to avoid having to conti nue 
fighting against this practice. 

"This speaks to the national 
problem, from community colleges 
to high-research institutions, where 
large parts of Faculty are becoming 
employees on a non-tenure track," 
Lonidier said. "Making headway on 
this, we become a model for educa-
tion across the nation." 

According to Lonidier, while 
the new contract wording seems to 
make concessions in favor of 
increased security for both pre-
and post-six-year lecturers, its lan-
guage remains less strong than 
what the union had asked for, and 
while the union feels that the con-
tract points to the university giving 
greater recognition to the impor-
tance of lecturers, its applica tions 
in practice remain to be seen. 

"Our lecturers playa critical role 
in helping UC fulfill its insrrucoon-
al mandate, and we believe this 
agreement helps to recogniz.e the 
valuable contributions they make to

Lecturer~ represent about 12 
percent of the Universiry of 
California 's total faculty. 

The lecturers' contract also 
includes additi onal prohibitions 
against strikes and a cornmmnent 
to review workloads in ta rgeted 
programs. 

T he tentative contract with thc 
University ProfeSSIOnal and 
Technical Employees union, 
which represent appTOXltnarely 
4,400 research su pport profes-
siona l employees and 4,000 tech-
nical employees, addresses the kcy 
issue that the union had been 
protesting through a compromise. 
Where in the past laid-off 
employees were forced by the uni -
versity to choose between sever-
ance pay and preferential re-hir-
ing - with the union aslcing for 
both - the new contract would 
now allow for a third option in the 
form of a "combination" package 
of less-than-full severance pay in 
coordination WIth limited prefer-
ential re-hire rights. 

Research professionals also 
gained steady wage increases, with 
differing forms of merit step 
inc reases across the board for 
union employees. 

Representatives from both 
unions have indicated wider 
acceptance of the new con tracts 
than that displayed by clerical 
union member following the set-
tlement of thclr contract with the 
universi ty in pril , which gave 
worker wage Increases far below 
what the union had ongmally 
demanded.

A year in review invokes pity, pondering and wonder 
Looking back at the inanities and inconsistencies of UCSD 
horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

I t was raining sideways, but my guide and r were walking normally to the panes of glass 
around the seventh fl oor of Geisel 
Library. So really, it was raining 
right side up, or upside down, for 
us, depending on what side of the 
building we were on. 

My guide, a short peppy Asian 
gi rl with one lock of hair bleached 
to burnt sienna stereotype, blath-
ered on to me about the library 
being in some '80s B-movie, but I 
stared at the glass, which reflected 
the seven si ns and virtues lit up in 
neon lights from the Structural 
Engineering building in Warren 
College. 

The next step I took wa not 
o nto another pane of glass; I 
stepped into, right side up, the 
seventh floor of Geisel. Table 
after table after table fill ed the 
room, and in between racks of 
books, zig-zaggi ng along walls, 
suspended from the ceilings, 
coming out of doors, stretching as 
far as the eye could sec, were 
occupied with silently studying 
students. 

We walked silently past them, 
and [ glanced over their shoulders 
at what was written in their text-
book : The charge a socia ted with 
depletion mode . It was the reason 
I majored m electrical engmeer-
mg. It was also because it was one 
of the highest paid majors commg 

out of college. 
T he electrical engineering 

program would not have been 
instituted without federal inter-
vention; at least it's hetter than 
going out into the real world and 
working. Anyway, ['II figure out 
what [ want to do in a couple 
years. 

The most widely u ed differen-
tial stain for bacteria is why do [ 
want to become a doctor? Of 
course, I want to help people. 
Yeah, right - do you think my 
parents would let me do anything 
else? 

My guide walked briskly 
between the tables and the stu-
dents, managing not to mi ss a step 
as [ tripped on backpacks and 
chair legs in a vain attempt to 
keep up. Maybe the guide caught 
a glance of my face contorted in 
disapproval. She stopped for a 
second, raised an eyebrow at me, 
and said pointedly, "Do you think 
you're any better?" and then 
grinned . 

We mad e it to the elevator, 
which deposited us in T ioga Hall, 
where we passed by a freshman 
couple cuddling up on a dorm 
couch, down some suirs into the 
middl e of an A.S . Council meet-
ing in the Price Center Ballroom. 

One of the senators was 
earnestly speaking into the micro-
phone, her face contorted with 
righteous rage at some slight oy 
the administration over parking or 
diversity or lunch meat. We walKed 
around the table behind her as she 
continued her honest tirade, and 
my gUide pointed to her note ; a 
hIghlighted item on the agenda for 
the meeting read, "olutlon on 

parking and housing." 
The sub~cript read "Use thI S 

for my application for law school, 
because it demonstrates my lead -
er~hlp qualities." That part was 
underlined once, 111 red font Jnd 
in perfect ,\1Icrosoft 'Nord anno-
tallon formal. 

" You have done noth, 
ing to enhance the 
material welfare of 
your society by the act 
of learning. Ins tead , 
you swallow resources 
and congratulate 
yourself for grades 
that the university 
assigns as a matter of 
pedagogical incentive , 
rather than as any real 
measure of achieve, 
ment .... " 

As we left the chamber and 
walked down Library Walk past 
Greek organizations that were, of 
course, perfectly III line with the 
mission of education, research and 
service with their prettily painted 
httle wooden booths that demon-
strated exactly the control those 
already in the organization had 
over pledges. We walked past gory 
pIctures of abortions, whIch, of 

course, was a perfect argument 
against abortion - Just like gory 
pictures of open-heart \urgery 
were a great argument that God 
was on your side that medI cal pro-
cedures' were a bad th1l1g. 

\ Ve walked past ,1 group of pro-
testors protesting agaln~t offen-
si,'c race-based humor, because, of 
course, anythIng that would actu -
ally mear. something should not 
be said at all, even (or e pecially) 
in jest - just like God was not on 
the side of anything that produced 
gory pictures. Mo t certainly, 
however, I Ie was on the side of 
Greek organizations. 

It was still raining sideways 
when we got to Center Hall 105 . 
The guide and [ came in through 
the back of the building where a 
lower division math lecture was in 
full swing. 

A rather hapless graduate Stu-
dent was giving the lecture despite 
the fact that in cluster of three or 
four, students throughout the lec-
ture hall were chatting with each 
other. 

The only thing that was audi-
ble was the chatter throughout the 
hall : 

"[ don't understand how he gOt 
that out of the integral. Of course 
what we're talking about is more 
important than respect for our 
instructo rs or the learning of 
everybody else here." 

"Are we going down to PB 
tonight, because I can't stand the 
fact that he JUSt doesn't give us all 
A's'" 

My gUIde tapped me on the 
shoulder. I turned around and I 
was outSIde on RIMAC field at a 
graduation ceremony, where It

A OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

U sing shock over reason 
Debate tactics overly emotional 

By JESSICA LlNCal 
Associate Opinion Editor 

' omerime It isn't the issue 
llsclf, but rather how an is~ue I 
argued that generates dia logue. 
People can be 1110ti"ated to dis-
cus, a subject because they were 
,1I1gered at the methods of 
debate. And most certainly, the 
hock value th at was intended to 

pique in terest in tead incites 
anger. 

In preparing fo r the Supreme 
Court decision on the Ul11ver ity 
of Michigan' affirma tive ac tion 
cases, ollege Republicans at 
UC D orga nized an informauon 
tahle and held a mock ba ke sale 
on ,\1 ay 19. 

The bake sale consisted of 
certificates that would ha\'e been 
redeemable for baked goods (the 
lack of a permit prevented the 
grou p fro m ac tually di tributi ng 
any food). Different prICes were 
set according to various mi nority 
group - minOrity female were 
priced at 15 cents, minority 
mal e al 50 cents, white female 
at one dollar and white males at 
rwo dollars. 

College Republicans admit-
ted that they knew their di play 
was borderline offensive. "The 
111ggest point was to have differ-
ent rankings ba ed on ethnicity 
and gender to show the absurdi-
ty of affirmati \'e action," aid 
College Republicans Vice 
PreSident Amanda Steele. 

But even though their goal 
was to generate discussion on the 
different IS ues urroundi ng 

CAMPUS 

" Much Uke the abortion 
debate is often advanced 
with overblown pictures 
of dead fetuses, using 

shock value to generate 
di cussian only leads to 
overly tainting an issue 

with emotional 
utbur " o sts , .. . 

affi rmative action, the fact 
remains tha t the debate was 
fra med by shock value, 

a t long after they began 
seiling their baked goods, a 
counter-protest was launched by 
disgruntl ed students. A small 
band of protesters made signs 
sayi ng, "D iversity uck , Ban 

Affirmative Action," declaring 
their stance to be a mockery of 
the College Republicans' mock-
ery. 

The debate had become littl e 
more th an an exchange of 
insults, Even if stud ents did 
engage in discussion as a result 
of the display on Library Walk, 
it was discussion founded on tak-
ing offense. 

Perhaps it isn't rea lly the fault 
of th e College Republicans or of 
students who found their bake 
sale offensive. Perhaps th is i 
rea lly the result of years of mud-
linging in the political arena, of 

content over concept, o f looking 
not at what a politician believes 
111 but rather who they've lept 
with . 

Much like the aborti on 
debate is often adva nced through 
overblown pi ctures o f dead 
fetuses, using shock value to 
generate di cussion only leads to 
overly taintin g an i sue with 
emotional outbursts instead of 
informed rea oning. 

Certainly, there IS a place for 
emotion and persona l experience 
in politics. Often, the mo t dri-
ven, committed and inspirational 
activists are those with a personal 
connection or emotional oc to 
their cause, But in the aClllal 
argumentation of social concerns, 
the attempt should be to inrorm 
the curious about different 
aspects of a political issue rather 
than persuasion based on playi ng 
to prejudices or personal pleas.

LmER TO THE EDITOR 
Abortion display was 
not given coverage 

Editor: 
I am appalled that the Guardian 

failed to cover the events concern-
ing abortion that took placc on 
campus May 14 and 15 . 'Nhen an 
event cause so much controversy 
that adm inistra-
tors' offices are 
flooded with 

" 

A woman's fundamental right 
to choose is inextricably linked to 
achievi ng gender equality, 

By using such exaggerated 
graphic displays in an attempt to 
provoke an intense negative reac-
tion to the idea of abortion, J ul tice 
For All does a grave disservice to 
women facing unplanned pregnan-
cies. Behind every choice IS a Story 

antI beca use we ca n-
not know all of 
them, we must leavc complaints, I 

would think that 
the Guardian 
would feel a 
responsibility to 
bring awareness 
lO the eventS tak-
ing place. 

Students not 
only voiced their 
disgust of the 
Justice For All 
anti-choice dis-
play through for-
mal complaints, 
they protested, 
wore pro-choice 
t-shirts and 

Behind every choice 
is a story and 

because we cannot

we must leave a 

a woman the roo l11

ThiS week's ruling comes seven 
years after the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996, a di aster 111 its own 
right , when mergers like America 
Online-Time Warner or Disney-
ABC occured. The 1996 act 
worked III the favor of the global 
media empires, as they snatched up 
as many broadcast, Web and print 
media as allowed in order to remain 
"competitive. " 

As it stands, five companies -
AOL-Time Warner, News 

orporation , Viacom, General 
ElectriC and Disney - own over 90 
percent of the televiSion stations in 
the United State . So whlle the 70-

diverSity of interests, they are real-
ly representative of five companies'

It 's the dnve fo r compeotion 
that has kept the market on a steady 
pa th toward anarchy since the 
19 Os. Under Reagan, the FCC 
worked to disspell "the perception

For exampl e, look at cable news. 
Currently, national network news 
programs, such as programs 
anchored by Tom Brokaw, Peter 
Jenning or Dan Rather, have seen 
a drastic plunge in ratings becau e 
cable news is all the rage these days. 
CNN, Fox News and MSNBC are 
the providers of news these days as 
cable ownership laws were relaxed 
in 1996, stimulating the market. As 
intended, the consumer has polten 
a a result of this increllsed compe-
ution. But the competition did not 
stimu:ate the market by proVldmg a

ratings battle has only resulted in 
producing Fox News imposters 
instead of trying to appeal to the 
taste of everybody else. 

In a recent interview on "The 
Daily Show with Jon Stewart," 
Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's 
"Hardball," announced that his 
network would be revamping their 
programming schedule to compete 
with Fox ews, Would MS BC be

buy the BC properties (includ-
ing their holdings in MSNBC) 
from General Electric after t.he 
FCC loosened the regulations on 
how much of the national audi -
ence a company can reach from 35 
percent to 45 percent. 

In April 2002, a federal appeal 
judge ask.ed that the 35 percent rule 
be reviewed, but it never was very 
enforceable. Both Viacom (owncr 
of CBS and UPN networks among 
others) and News Corp. (manager 
of Fox and all its spin-off) had 
already exceeded the 35 percent 
rule added in the 1996 act.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION A9 

FCC: Domination of broadcasting borders 
of a monopoly of the media market 

continued {rom page A8 
Radio Act of 1927, the federal 
goverrunent expected companies 
to uphold the public interest in 
exchange for the opportunity to 
broadcast exclusively on the scarce 
frequencies. Scarcity seem like a 
concept of the past, but not if you 
consider the rising costs it takes to 
operate a media Olltlet as the mar-
ket becomes more and more con-

centra ted , A diversity of view-
pointS must be available to the 
American public if democracy is to 
be preserved. 

The cozying up to business and 
political partners by "news" sta -
tions such as by News Corp., and 
the conglomeration of such inter-
ests across every medi um from 
book publishing to satellite own-

er hip (oh yeah, News Corp. boss 
Rupert Murdoch is about to fo rk 
over $6.6 bill ion to acqui re 
DirecTV} only serve to dl;tract 
the mass medid's purpose of deliV-
ering varyi ng viewpoi nts, obJec-
tive news and entertainment for 
entertainment's sa ke instead of 
fulfilling their own agenda and 
interests. 

Debate: Affirmative action discussion 
an example of a much bigger problem 
continued {rom page A8 

That was the problem with 
the well -intentioned debates 
began by the College 
Republicans. Yes, they have every 
right to seek attention in order [(1 
garner interest. Yes, they have 
every right to engage in ques-
tionable conduct in order to 
prove a point. But their cause -
indeed, every cause - would be 
better furthered by genuine 
debate rath er than irritated 
pas ersby. 

There is a tempta t ion to 
argue that any political or social 
involvement is better than none 
at all and that the overall cl imate 
of apathy among the younger 
generation (and UCSD in par-
ti cular) is such that any inte rest 
in current events should be 
applauded irrespective of the 
details, 

And, although it IS true that 
therc's a stark lack of involvement 
among American youth, surely the 
answer is not through provoking a 
debate through sca re tactics and 

shock value, but rather through 
fostering a genuine interest in pol-
itics. 

Maybe that seems idea lis tic, 
an unlikely scenari o in which 

" both sides of the debate 
and the debate itself could 

be improved if they 
moved beyond cheap 

shots at emotional 
appeals, into earnest and 

inteUectual debate . " 
everyone wa well-informed , 
everyone was inspired to partici-
pate in the political arena, every-
one was interested in political 
and social concerns. 
Unfortunately, that lund of Ulll-

lateral appreCiati on cannot bc 
expected, although it can be 
hoped fo r. 

\Vhat is perh aps more reason-
able would be to pass Out litera-
ture on the pro's and con's of 
affi rm ati ve action insteau of 
ass igning monetary va lue to dif-
fe rent minority groups as per 
cupca ke and cookies, A petition 
to li mit offensive mJterl,t1 would 
be more effective than a coutner-
protest conSisti ng of sarcastic 
signs. 

T he causes aren't to hlame 111

C/CPC approves new lots 
Four new surface parking lots on east 

campus could provide 975 spaces 
By MAlNOTE FlDE.IS 

Senior Staff Writer 

The Campus/Community Planning 
Committee recently approved a proposal by 
the Transportation Policy Committee to use 
land for the development of four surface 
parking lots on East Campus. The four lots 
will provide approximately 975 new parking 
spaces. 

Allocation of the new parking spots has 
not yet been determined, although discus-
sion is underway for what type of spaces will 
be created. 

"The assumption is that. in these loca-
tions, there would be primarily'S' spaces 
with some staff parking," said Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Campus Planning and TPC-
member Jeff Steindorf. 

Construction is scheduled to begin 
once costs and designs are finalized. Costs 
for construction are approximated at $2 .1 
million. The ClCPC has designated the 
use of two locations in the Science 
Research Park area, an area around 
Thorton Hospital, 'and a section bordered 
by Genesee Avenue, Campus Point Drive 
and Voigt Drive. . 

"We are currently working with the 
UCSD Office of Facilities, Design and 
Construction, who will develop plans, final-
ize cost estimates and award the construc-
tion contracts," said Director of 
Transportation and Parking Services Greg 
Snee. 

According to the proposal submitted to 
the ClCPC, the campus will be unable to 
meet the .41 parking spaces per capita, or 90 
percent occupancy goal for the 2003-04 aca-
demic year. Additionally, it is expected that 
the parking demands will increase for the 
2004-05 academic year due to rises in stu-
dent enrollment and to the recent displace-
ment of parking spaces. 

Three of the four lots will be permanent. 
The third lot, Lot P703, which is the area 
bordered by Genesee Avenue and Campus 
Point Drive, is also the future site for the 
relocation ofUCSD Extended Studies. This 
lot would serve as a temporary space for 
parking and does not stop any future acade-
mic use of the area. 

Meanwhile, the site proposed near 

Thorton Hospital was previously approved 
to be the site of a surface parking lot after 
the completion of the J-5/Gilman Bridge 
Project. However, delays with the bridge 
project prompted the T&PS to push for the 
immediate development of the surface lot. 

The two parking lots in the Science 
Research Park wiU be built consistently to a 
previous plan called the SRP Development 
Concept, which indicates that the surface 
parking lots be built during phase two of its 
development. The Development Concept 
would also allow the lots to be designated 
for campus use in the short tenn. 

According to Snee, the TPC had made 
several recommendations to the Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs, Steven W 
Relyea, after reviewing the proposed park-
ing displacement of 509 parking spaces in 
the next year. Additionally, new student 
enrollment numbers will dictate the need 
for additional parking. 

Other recommendations that were 
made include the improvement of the 
cityshuttle system in 2003 to provide alter-
nate options for students, faculty and staff. 
The TPC also proposed to re-stripe park-
ing staUs within existing parking lots to 
provide supplementary parking spaces and 
suggested postponing the implementation 
of a system that would limit freshman resi-
dent parking in Fall 2003. 

Even with the expectation that the 
demand for parking will be unprecedented 
in the 2003-04 academic year, the TPC has 
suggested that the previous recommenda-
tions would supply adequate parking. 
Finally, the TPC proposed the creation of a 
work group to develop procedures in imple-
menting the limitation of freshman resident 
parking for the 2004-05 year. 

"I don 't necessarily know the intentions 
of the TPC, but it would appear that they 
are actively pursuing rectifying the parking 
situation by adding additional parking lots 
on East Campu ," said A.S. Commissioner 
of Enterpri e Operations Jeremy Cogan, 
who serves as the A.S. representative to the 
ClCPC. "The new parking lots would hope-
fully, as stated at ClCPC, be majority'S' 
parking lots; thus, there would be sufficient 
spaces on East Campus at least to meet a 
growing demand for spaces." 

Talks: Meeting encourages dialogue 
continlled from page I 

its kind, in the level of the people involved on 
the American side and the Korean side as 
well," aid UCSD professor usan Shirk, an 
attendee during the discussions and a special-
ist on Asian politics and international affairs. 

There was also an effort made to keep the 
specifics of the discussion within the room. 

"We all spoke as individuals. not as rep-
resentative~ of our government," aid 
Bradley Babson, a consultant on Asian 
affair and expert on the North Korean 
economy. 

According to hirk, there have been sev-
eral similar discussions between the United 
States and North Korea in the recent past, 
but only one other concentrated specifically 
on the bilateral relations between the two 
nations. 

"The problem is that North Korea feels 
threatened by the U.S., and the U.S. feel 
threatened by North Korea," Shirk said . 

The event was hosted by the UC-wide 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation, which wa founded and is 
based at UC D. 

Bob Einhorn, deputy assistant during the 
Clinton administration, was among the con-
ference's attendees. UCSD professors in 
attendance included Larry Krause and 
Stephan Haggard, both from IRIPS. 

According to Babson, both sides were in 
agreement on the impo"tance of open dia-
logue between the twO ~ountries. 

"The purpose of the discussions was to 
clarify and understand that each side has 
major issues," said IRIPS Dean Peter 
Cowhey. "It is hard to know how to estimate 
what the other side is thinking." 

Among the issues discussed were 
nuclear weapons, security and economic 
reforms. 

"The nuclear issue was really fTont and 
center," hirk said. 

Conference attendees from the United 
States' side will be in communication with 
the government. 

According to Babson, uch talks are a 
good start to improve relations between the 
two nations. 

"Everyone in the meeting had high hopes 
and wanted to make the effort," Babson aid.

Lab to develop security sytem 
Grant aids in developing technology 

Relationship ban passed 
Faculty-student romances restricted 

By MEUSSA BANIQUED 
Staff Writer 

A group of scienti ts at UC D's Computer 
Vision and Robotics Research Laboratory 
recently received a $600,000 award to contin-
ue developing technology for an automated 
system designed to fight terrorism by detect-
ing and tracking faces in a crowd. 

The funding comes from the Technical 
Support 'Norking Group, an interagency that 
provides for the research, developmem and 
prototyping of new technology for the 
• arional Re earch and Development 
Program for Combating Terrori m. The 
organization coordinates interagency and 
international research and developmem 
requirements for fighting terrori m. 

The grant will be geared toward "solving 
outstanding research problems," said Mohan 
Trivedi, CVRR director and electrical and 
computer engineering profes or. Current and 
ongoing research project a socia ted with 
other agencies will aI 0 benefit from the 
grant. The goal is to refine the technical 
aspects of identifying and tracking possible 
terrorists through the use of networks of 
"smart" camera . 

There are two main technical problems 
researchers are trying to solve. First, camera 
systems must be able to automatically recog-
nize Ignificant events within a wide area and 
without human aid. Second, the cameras must 
work in a variety of conditions and environ-
ments. Thi includes functioning in different 
settings such as airports navy bases and air-
craft caITIer~. It also means that they have to 
work With different lighting conditions elunng 
daytime, night and any type of weather. 

''The systems must be smart enough to 
.ldapt," TrivedJ said. "In general, these are 
extremely difficult problems to soh-e." 

Becau e the moner IS coming from 
\ \ 'ash11lgton, D .C., he explained, research will 
focu on national seCUrIty. 

"[The award] gIVes ~s a very Important 
re earch o pportunity," Trivedi said. "On 
another level. it al 0 make our work hJghl)' 

connected to making the community safer." 
He noted that the funding provides the 

resources they need to improve upon projects 
on which they are currently working. 

The project i one of nine winning pro-
posals for public safety and sun'eillance deal -
ing with video technology. TSWG received 
more than 12 ,500 research proposals from 
industry, academic, government and national 
labs responding to a special call for bids after 
the ept. II attacks. 

Proposals went through three layers of 
review, narrowing down the competition to 
600 entrants, and then to a few dozen. 

Two prominent project that the CVRR 
lab has been working on over the last five 
years involve using computer systems and 
"smart" camera to improve traffic and auto-
mobile safety. 

Sponsored mainly by Caltrans, the first 
project uses computer systems to identify road-
way situations uch as accidents and slow traf-
fic . Thi then makes it easier to reach ambu-
lances for help as well as contact family mem-
bers. M u1ti-camera systems called Distributed 
Interactive Video Arrays have already been 
developed to monitor traffic. DIVAS connect 
\'ariou kind of cameras, among which are 
Omnivision panoramic cameras. 

The econd project uses affective analysis 
to interpret human activity anJmake distract-
ed drivers more aware. Researchers have 
worked With car companies like Nissan, 
Volkswagen and Chrysler to develop cooper-
ati\'e cameras that would make cars give ig-
nal to prompt people to pay more attention 
while driving. 

The CVRR Laboratory at UC D, a oci-
ated with the Jacob School of Engineering, 
has been researching the field of sensor-based 
Intelligent s)' terns for eight years. The group 
of approximately 20 researchers involved in 
the CVRR lab i compnsed of undergraduate 
and graduate rudents, faculty members and 
\1S1t1ng scholars. TS'" 'G is an agency over-
seen by the Department of tate's coordina tor

[n an effort to establish a UC-wide pol -
icy, the cademic Senate passed an 
amendment regulating romantic relation-
ships between srudents and faculty on May 
28. 

By a vote of 32-1-3, the senate 
approved an amendment to the Faculty 
Code of Conduct which would "prohibit a 
faculty member from entering into a 
romantic or sexual relationship" with any 
student he or she has or should "reason-
ably expect to have" academic responsibil -
i ty over in the future. 

The proposal would also "prohibit fac-
ulty ftom exercising academic responsibil -
ity for any student with whom a faculty 
member has a romantic or sexual relation-
ship." 

The issue aro e in 2001, when it was 
discovered that the Faculty Code of 
Conduct failed to demarcate sexual rela-
tionship between students and faculty. 

"We simply didn't have a policy 
[regarding this issuel,"UCA Academic 
Senate Chair Gayle Binion said. 

Although individual UC campuses hold 
varying policies in this matter, Binion said 
he believed that a clear, system wide pol-

icy was essential to the "integrity of the 
educational mission." 

"I supported the changes," said 
Lawrence Pitts, senate vice chair. "In aca-
demic ituation there can be 3n unequal 
power structure not appropriate for a con-
sensual relationship - even if the rela-
tionship is going well, it could disadvan-
tage other nldent . They could feel alien-
ated." 

The U Board of Regents will address 
the amendment over summer. With the 
regents' approval, the propo cd changes 
\vill take effect in Fall 2003. 

"I think they'll accept it," Pius aid , 
addIng that the fact that the senate 
passed the amendment should have a 

UCSD Dip,oma nere\ler 
Ad\lance '.Nt to go 

~ou wan 

"tremendous" impact on the Regents' 
decision. 

The proposed changes to the Faculty 
Code of Conduct were modeled after the 
system used at Yale University and cOllSti -
rute a "fairly moderate policy," according 
to UC spokesperson Abby Lummlini. 

Universities vary in the degree to 
which they regulate romantic r.elation-
ship between students and faculty, with 
some schools simply discourabring such 
relationships and others strictly prohibit-
ing them. 

According to Pitts, the amendment 
passed by the senate "strikes a reason-
able balance" between these rwo ideolo-
gies. 

Some members of the UC Academic 
Senate, as well as the CSD Academic 
Senate, had reservations regarding the 
proposed changes. Some representatives 
felt the amendment should have dealt with 
the problems of srudent-faculty relation-
ships instead of prohibiting them altogeth-
er. 

Other members sought greater clarifi-
cation in the amendment. 

"While I agree with the spirit of the 
new regulation, I am sorry about the way 
it is strucnlred," said history professor 
Michael j\10nteon, a senate representa-
tive for Thurgood Marshall College. 
"Faculty members have known for some 
time tllat sexual involvement with any 
student is ri ky behavior 3Jld would prob-
ably invite censure. Thi broad and poor-
ly written plank has more to do with 
lawyers and lawsuits again t the universi-
ty than actually changing campus con-
duct. \Ve should have sent thiS one ha k 
to committee." 

If the changes arc implemented 111 Fall 
2003, facult), caught in \10lallOn of the 
poliC)' could be subject to a range of penal-
ties, from reprimand to complete dis-
missal.

Provost retires after 20 years 
Bond recognized for service to UCSD 

By CHRlmNE PAl 
Staff Writer 

Having served as Revelle 
College provost for 20 years, F. 
Thomas Bond is retiring after set-
ting the record for the longest-
held position as provost in the his-
rory of the Revelle campus, A 
reception in his honor will be held 
at the Revelle lawn shortly after 
the 38th annual Watermelon 
Drop on June 6. 

Prior ro Bond, the longest 
time period in which a provost 
served at Revelle College was five 
years. Throughout UCSD col-
leges, Bond is rivaled only by 
John Stewart, who served as John 
Muir College provost for 22 
years. 

Chancellor Robert C. Dynes as 
well as 400 guests, including mem-
bers of UCSD faculty and Revelle 
Student Council, will be attending 
the reception. 

In addition to acting as 
provost for Revelle College, 
Bond has been a part of UCSD 
for 37 years, serving as an org:ln-
ic chemistry professor and a 
member of the medical school's 
admissions committee. During 
his time as provost, Bond worked 
with six successive vice chancel-
lors. This past spri ng quarter, 
Bond taught a freshman biology 
seminar named "There's 
Chemicals in My Food." 

Revelle College senior and 
Revelle College Council Chair 
Alex Shafgans noted Bond's influ-
ential pre ence in Revelle. 

"I like to consider Dr. Bond as 
the grandfather of Revelle," 

hafgans said. "lIe is the kind of 
guy who is very warm-hearted 
and is incredibly generous in that 
he never hesitates to offer his 
assistance or counsel to stu-
dents ... 

[n a statement, Bond explained 
that being a provost is inevitably 
linked to teaching. 

"I don't think you can be a 
provost without teaching," he 
stated. "I just felt you had to be in 
the trenches, talking to students 
one-on -one." 

Shafgans will be sp'eaking 
brieAy at the reception for Bond. 

"He is an incredibly approach-
able person," Shafgans said. "One 
of the greatest things is that he is 
an advocate of students." 

One of the thing,~ Bond advo-
cated was the Revelle Humanities 
program, a Revelle College gener-
al education requirement that 
consists of hi tory and literature 
of the ancient as well as the mod-
ern Western world. Bond said 
that, since the program's birth in 
the late 1970s, 
he received 
much input 
from Revelle 
students upon 
their comple-
tion of the 
five-quarter 
requirement. 

According 
to Bond, stu-
dents did not 
enjoy taking six 
quarters of a 
general educa-

F. 'ftIonus Bond 
Revelle College 

prOYOSt for 20 
year.; 

tion course, and alterations were 
continually made to accommodate 
the needs of students. 

Even 0, Bond recalled 
moments when he spoke to for-
mer Revelle students who were 
glad that such a general educa-
tional requirement was offered. 

Shafgans echoed the sentiment. 
"He made a big push to save' 

the humanities program, and I 
personally think that it is a defin-
ing program in Revelle," Shafgans 
aid. "You really do appreciate all 

the things you've learned." 
Bond said that upon first arriv-

ing at UCSD in 1967, he was 
accustomed to moving frequently, 
not having spent more than four 
or five years in one place. 

"I moved around a lot and I 
had SOrt of accepted that as the 
norm," Bond said. "But when I 
worked here for a while, I found 
J really enjoyed UCSD. Besides 
having a wonderful office, I've 
worked with a lot of good facul-
ty, staff and students, and J just 
love the people that [ work with . 
Of course, there are a few stu-
dents who cause you grief and 
pain, but you can't expect to have 
20,000 student without having a 
few who feci that they are enti-
tled to private rooms, reserved 
parking and 'A' grades in every 
course." 

Bond said he has encountered 
a lot of positive changes on cam-
pus in the time he's spent at 
UCSD. One improvement in ser-
vices to students that Bond noted 
was the new city shuttle system. 
Bond pointed to the fact that La 
Jolla lacks the typical college 
atmosphere that UCLA's 
Westwood or UC Berkeley's cam-
pus offers. To him, offering the 
city shuttle was a big step in allow-
ing students to explore off-<:ampus 
opportunities. 

") think it's been a big addi-
tion," Bond said. "The partung 
services people should be praised 
for putting it on - just see how 
popular it is now." 

According to Bond, the 
uniqueness of the UCSD campus 
is what most attracted him in 
maintaining his career here. 

"Relative to other college, it 
has a relaxed atmosphere," Bond 
said. "[t's a good campus for peo-
ple who are a little more assertive 
and who want to jump at opportu-
nities." 

Bond's extensive career at 
UCSD will be celebrated by many 
at the reception held in his honor. 

"You never know how appreci-
ated you are until you tell people 
you're going to leave,~ Bond said. 
"I've enjoyed my time at UCSD 
immensely. "

Funding: A.S. allocates money 
bers. 

continued from page 2 
Executive officers, commission-

ers, senators and other AS. assis-
tants currently receive sti pends 
ranging from $10 to $105 per Vleck 
for a varying number of weeks. 

The version of the budget used 
at a June 2 meeting for the budget 
increased stipends for some council 
members, including the president 
and college senators. However, the 
budget approved for next year 
keeps stipends at levels consistent 
wi th previous years and does not 
take into account any voluntary 
reductions that may occur in the 
future. 

Another target for funding was 
the AS. programming line item. 

Sierra Cat ... ott, Thurgood 
Marshall College senior senator and 
senate chair, expressed apprehension 
about the large size of the proposed 
increase in the programming budget 

Alex Kushner, commissioner of 
programming, predicted corporate 
sponsorship of events like the Sun 
God Festival might actually make a 
proS t for the council in the future. In 
order to get to that poin t, Kushner 
said, more money is now needed. 

Catcott said the reduced funds 
would impact smaller programs, like 
lecture series, and T.C.I.F. and 
Nooners concertS, rather than the 
large quarterly festivals. 

"I think SIORC is an excellent 
organization and'they need to be 
protected," Catcott safd . 

The budget .passed by the coun-

cil for 2003-04 increases the pro-
gramming line item by $20,000 
from the previous year for a total of 
$445,000 budgeted. 

Addressing another item of con-
tenrion during the June 2 meeting, 
Chris Murphy, a senior at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, urged the coun-
cil to increase funding for the 
Academic Success Program. 

"We would like funding of$1 per 
student per quarter, in accordance 
with the lock-i n," Murphy said. 
"That one dollar, in my opinion, 
shouldn't even be discussed." 

The draft of the budget used at 
the meeting underfunded the 
required level for ASP by $2,157. 
Council members voiced support for 
Murphy's argument and recoll1-
mended the deficiency be corrected. 

The budget passed by the coun-
cil allocated $38,257.02 for ASp, 
meeting the levels approved by the 
referendum. 

The approved budget anticipates 
19,800 students for the next acade-
mic year with the quarterly AS. 
activity fee gener:lting over $1.2 mil-
lion in revenue. An additional 
$108,060 is expected to be produced 
by AS. Soft Reserves, the Crove 
Caffe an~ AS. Lecture otes. 

Since the approved budget does 
not meet the amount for a mandated 
reserve in the Office of Enterprise 
Operations, the council was 
required to suspend a financial 
bylaw that requires such a reserve. 
The bylaw was suspended WIth a 
vote of 15-0-2.

It also calls for the AS. Council to 
hold an educational dialogue event 
with college councils, UCSD stu-
dent organizations and the San 
Diego community to "begin to work 
toward a more accepting campus," 
before the' end of 2003 . 

Watson's letter echoed the repro-
bation. 

"The paper mocks [slam, its 
beliefs and practices, in a VIle and 
obscene manner," Watson stated.

and because I was familiar with 
him after living in the dorms. 
He not only helped me and my 
parents find a great place, he 
also cares about you, which is 
evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am 
doing. He has been a 

tremendous help and I hope when I'm ready to buy property 
later in life I will have a real estate agent who has been as 
wonderful aslObin! CallinglObin is a no-brainer if you are 
looking for a place to live." -Todd Schrrwin 

·Our son Todd told us 
aboutTobin and we 
immediately called him 
to help us find a place. 
We were extremely 
pleased with his vast 
knowledge of the area 
and his care for safety. 
We sent Tobin out with 
Todd to find a place, 
and Tobin did an awesome job. He has been 
extremely helpful, and is always there for you l We 
trusted him to find a place for our son and so should 
you.· - SMldon" SMa Ann Sc:hrrwin

"I realized I needed to start 
hunting around for a place to 
live, so I gave Tobin a call and 
he hooked me upl After I had 
found a place that 1 liked, he 
fought off other bidders until the 
place was ours. Tobin helped me 
every step of the way. He came 
to my apartment and took the 
forms and delivered them to the 
appropriate places for me. So now I have this property, but 1 won't 
even need it until next year-not a problem! Tobin found renters

SENIOR SENDOFFS 

UCSD swimming will lose five athletes to graduation 
Allison, Brammer leave men's team; women's will miss Watanabe, Wong, and Quon 

By EVA HOFFMAN 
Staff Writer 

With the close of the 2002-03 
season, the UCSD men and 
women's swimming and diving 
teams 10 e five graduating seniors 
who were valuable participants and 
leaders. Thi june, co-captains 
Dagan Allison and Luca Brammer 
say goodbye to the men 's team. 
Capt:lin Jennifer ' Vatanabe, 

amantha Wong and ruver Emily 
Quon leave the women's team. 

Allison' swimming career at 
UCSD got off to a rocky start when 
he accidentally slept through his fin;t 
Saturday morrung workout and 
almOSt got cut from the team as a 
result; but he quickly reversed that 
bad fin;t impression. UCSD head 
coach SCOtt McGihon now says that 
Allison is "a tremendously hard 
worker." 

From start to finish, Allison was a 
stellar swimmer, qualifying for the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships every 
year. Freesryle ~ Allisons fone. 
But beyond earning points for 
UCSD, Allison was an excellent cap-
tain, fostering team spirit and 
encouraging other swimmers. 

"He took it upon himself to lead 
the team in cheers," McGihon said. 
"In doing so, he really motivated a 
lot of people. He's really going to be 
missed both for his leadership and 
his work ethic." 

Allison put everything he had 
into swimming this past season, 
malang it his first prioriry. Even 
though he cannot compete any 
longer, it is dear that his heart is still 
with the team. 

"Leaving UCSD swimming is 
something that 1 wish 1 did not have 
to do. E,'cry time I see my team-
mates, I \,;sh I still had the chances 
they have to Improve and compete 
with such good friends," Allison saId. 

llison's co-captam Branuner, a 
mechanical engmeenng major, also 
started swlOuning as a first-year, but 
experienced a rollcr-coaster rldc of 
Inlury and rccovcry during the rest 
of hi, sport!> career at UC D. 

As a freshman, he dId well s\nm-
ming the 100- and 200-yard butter-

MuIousfive 

fly and the 200-yard individualmed-
ley. During his sophomore year, 
however, Brammer dislocated his 
shoulder seven times and had to 
ha ve a surgery. 

Because his surgeons hit a nerve 
in his shoulder, Brammers arm was 
basically disabled for over a year. In 
the 18 months that he was unable to 
swim, Brammer "was able to give the 
team a lot of guidance and a lot of 
support," McGihon said. 

Derennined to compete in his 
final year, Brammer began working 
out again. He participated on the 
team through December 2002, then 
his doctor told him he had to stop 
swimming pennanently or risk fur-
ther damage to his shoulder. 

Despite the fact that Brammer 
could only race from time to time 
throughout his four years at UCSD, 
he continued to give his support to 
the swimmers and act as an "admin-
istrative captain." His dedication to 
the team will be missed. 

With the departure of Waunabe 
and Wong, the women's swim team 
loses two inspiring leaders. The two 
women started swimming at the 
same time their first year and 
became close frtt;nds. They Ifave 
mutual respect and admiration for 
each other. 

"Shes an All-American swinuner 
in the sense that he can SWIm what-
ever she wants and do really well," 
Wong said of Watanabe. . 

Watanabe, a team captain, dis-
played an abiliry to succeed in many

events. Her best events were the 
100- and 200-yard backstroke, but 
she also had eig~t school records and 
was a nine-time national champion. 
Her individual records include the 
100-yard backstroL::e (56.86), the 
200-yard backstroke (2:00.61), the 
200-yard individual medley 
(2:Q4.41), the 4OO-yard individual 
medley (4:22.68) and the 200-yard 
freestyle (I :49.69). Watanabe 
brought other skills to the pool deck 
besides her namral talenr for swim-
ming. 

"Her contribution to the team 
goes way beyond her swimming 
ability," McGihon said. "Her leader-
ship is what is going to be missed 
most next year. " 

Wong, too, was highly involved 
in the leadership of the athletic com-
munity at UCSD as president of the 
Triton Athletic Council this past 
year. In the water, Wong had a ruf-
ficult and variable swimming career. 
During her freshman and sopho-
more years, her prima.ry events were 
the 200-yard individual medley and 
the 100-yard backstroke. Her 
sophomore year brought a shoulder 
injury that impeded her improve-
ment. In the last twO years, he 
changed her focus and started to 
SWim the 100- and 200-yard 
frecsryle mo t often. McGihon said 
that Wong's greatest trength was 
her ablliry to perform well m a team 
setting. 

"One thing about amantha was 
you could always count on her in a 

relay," he said. 
Wong had three school records 

in the 400- and 8oo-yard freestyle 
relays and in the 400 medley relay. 

The supportive friendships that 
they formed with other members of 
the team seemed to be most impor-
tant to both women. Watanabe 
thanked Wong for "being there" for 
her throughout the past four years. 
Both expressed regret that they will 
be leaving so many close friends 
when they stop swimming after this 
year. 

Watanabe has completed her 
four years of sports eligibiliry, but 
she will remain at UCSD for one 
more year to finish her double major 
in math and computer science. 
Wong will graduate as an interrusci-
plinary computing and arts major 
with a management science minor in 
june. 

Emily Quon, a psychology major, 
participated on the diving team for 
two years. She excelled on the one-
meter board, but was strong on the 
three-meter board as well . 

ccording to diving coach jessica 
Pilger, one of Quon's greatest trait; 
was perseverance. If she had a poor 
entrance on a dive 3Jld smacked the 
water, she would get back up dnd try 
again. Pilger also said that Quon wa~ 
"a great person to coach." 

Entire team participation and 
group activities made diving more 
enjoyable for Quon. 

"Meets that were the funnest 
were the ones when the whole team 

was there," she said. 
Quon also said that when he 

leaves, she will miss the other divers, 
who she has grown close to over the 
past two years. 

All the graduates from the 
swinuning team remarked on the 
camaraderie between the swim-
mers. Unlike other spons or 
schools where the men 's and the 
women's teams are entirely sepa-
rate, the UCSD men and women 
built strong bonds of friendship 
during their shared workouts. 
Several graduates said that their 
experience on the team was like 
being part of a close-knit family. 

"You always had time to be with 
your teammates," Wong said. "You 
cat, you sleep, you swim - it's a big 
cycle and you all JUSt kind of do it 
together." 

Brammer spoke passionately 
about the things that hc IniSSes since 
he has stopped swimming. 

"1 miss how you feel when you 
finish a really hard workout and your 
whole body is sore," Brammer said. 
"I IniSS going home and JUSt passing 
out from being so tired. I miss being 
with people so mllch that you are 
more like siblings than JUSt friend!> . I 
miss seeing people do anl.lzing 
things in praCDCC when you wouldn't 
expect it. Most of all , ( mIss the mcn-
tal struggle that woule! go on every 
day at practice during .1 hard set 
when you want to ju t top and 
throw up, but - for some relson -
you don't."

TRIATHOLON 
The triathlon team is hard at 

work training for their next race. 
Despite having lost some of their 
star athletes to graduation or pro-
fessiomlleagues, UCSD still has a 
solid team. Male athletes Eric 
Mellers andJohn Firu.:e are consis-
tently competitive, while Amy 
Knapp, Natasha Cridler and 
Michelle Wedemeyer support the 
team in the female races. Led by 
captain Chris Richardson, UCSD 
hosted the second annual Dirry 
Dip-N-Dash and placed eighth a 
a team at the Wildflower 
Triathlon. 

Tbe team still has the majority 
of its summer season ahead, with 
races at Camp Pendleton, San 
Jose, Calif., and Los Angeles com-
ing up soon. 

The men's ultimate team had 
another great season, just barely 
missing out on a bid to natiomls. 
Led by Milte Cenzer, the team 
began its season with the annual 
Warm-Up Tournament, veteran 
players were refreshed and new 
members garnered experience. 

At the anta Barbara Invite 
Tournament, UCSD went 5-2 

before losing in the semifinals. At 
the Stanford Invite, UCSD went 
1-3 on the first day, but advanced 
to the finals of the B-bracket 
before losing to Washington 
State. 

Once the playoffs began, 
UCSD kicked it into high gear, 
winning sectionals with a blowout 
over UCSB. UCSD's B-team also 
had a strong showing, winning 
every game before losing to 
UCSB. 

At regionals, UCSD rolled into 
the finals with five straight wins 
against teams like UCLA and 
Arizona . The final was against 
rival 'Colorado, who pulled out a 
double-overtime 16-15 win in a 
marathon match to end UCSD's 
strea k and its dreams of playing at 
nationals. 

WOMEN'S ULTIMATE 
DISC 

Last year's national champi-
onship win over Stanford was a 
hard act to follow, yet the UCSD 
women's ultimate team still per-
formed compeotively. In its first 
event at Santa Barbara, UCSD 
advanced to the fimls before los-
IIlg to Stanford. In February, 
UCSD hosted the annual 
Pre Ident's Day Tournament, 
where the team had several 
notable wins, including a come-
bad over Universiry of British 
Columbia before falling again to 

Stanford in the semifinals. 
At the Stanford Invite 

Tournament, UCSD again per-
formed strongly, led by the 
defense of co-captain Alicia 
White, but still lost to UBC in the 
semifinals. 

After the regular season, 
UCSD stepped up the intensity of 
the gameplay, winning both the 
sectional and regional champi-
onships without losing a single 
game. UCSD entered the 
National Tournament as defend-
ing champions but with a No. 3 
ranking. The team came out 
strong with two wins, but lost to 
their long time rival Colorado and 
to Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology to end its hopes of a 
second-consecutive national title. 

WATERSKI 
Early in the school year, but 

late in the summer season, the 
UCSD waterski team took off to 
its best season in history, placing 
second at the Western Conference 
Regional Championships and 
qualifying the team for the com-
petitive Division 1 A nationals . 
Peter Mehrof and Katie Ambrose 
excelled in the men's and women's 
divisions, with additional upport 
from captains Tim Odell and 
Alicia Adams. The team finished 
eighth at nationals. 

UCSD Waterski also hosted 
and won the annual Dustin 

. " ,.1*' ( ,.",~,.I 

Newell Memorial Oktoberfest 
Event, which is dedicated to the 
memory of the former UCSD 
skier. 

tn the recent months, the 
waterski team has picked it up, fin-
ishing in third place at the 
Paradise Found Competition. 

WRESRING 
In its ina ugural year as a cI u b 

sporn team, the UCSD wrestling 
tum has turned some heads to 
what may be a potential wrestling 
powerhouse. Led by head coach 
Tony Ontiveros and captain Dave 
Hall, the team competed success-
fully against other teams in its 
division. After a slow stan to the 
season, the team emerged at the 
San jose State Dual Meet 
Championsltip. Brent Mori, 
Quiche Roura, Eric Smith and 
Dave full all got crucial pins to 
take a third-place overall firush. 

At the Western Regional 
Championships in Reno, ev., 
UCSD had some solid individual 
showings, inclurung a first-place 
finish by Kyle Kleinschmidt, a sec-
ond-place finish by Smith, and 
two third-place finishes by Roura 
and Wang in their respective 
weight c1as cs. U SD sent several 
wrestlers to the natIOnal champI-
onships, but were unable to place.

CLUB SPORTS 
BADMINTON 

The badminton team finished its 
regular season undefeated and with 
the national title. UCSD began the 
year with a number of impressive 
victories, especially by the women's 
team, which swept both San Diego 
State and UC Santa Barbara. 
Badminton also hosted its 15th 
annual Sun God Badminton 
Tournament in February, winning it 
for the second consecutivc year. In 
April, UCSD got the opportunity 
to host 22 teams in the national 
championship, and the host team 
pulled out a victory over UC Irvine. 
However, UCI got its revenge and 
took the league title. 

The team recogni zed its male 
Player of the Year as Chhay 'r.,ing, 
who worked his way into tlle o. I 
position, and tlle badminton team's 
female Player of the Year is Dede 
Davis. She is a nationally ranked 
player, and this year has been her 
strongest. She reulli led with her 
doubles partner Dara Walsh thIS 
year, and they finished tile season 
undefeatcd in league matches. 

CYCLING 
U D cycling had a competi-

tive team this year and was led by 
captains joe Merlone and Tona 
Rodriquez-Nikl. With Strong per-
formances all year by Geoff 
Rapoport on the men's side and 
Laura Resor and Megan Wemmer 
on the women's side, UCSD fin-
i hed in fifth place at the Western 
Collegiate Cycling Conference, 
qualifying the team for the national 
championships hosted by U 
Berkeley. At the national, UCSD 
finished in II th place, with 
Rodriguez-Nlkl and Rapoport fin-
i hing 27th and 33rd place in the 
men' mce, respectively, and Resor 
finishmg 17th in the female race. 

DANCESPORT 
Led by head coach Peter 

Edwards and captains Lindy Cabot 
and James I (ua, the dancesport team 
took home several trophies over the 
course of the year. The team danced 
its way to a first-place finish at the 
annual Day by the Shores, a UCSD-
hosted event which drew 1,500 
dancers from 22 different schools. 
The team also excelled at Stanford's 
Carrunal Classic, with the pairings 
of Patrick Chen-Tracy Hajkowski 
and Sean Gentry-Abby Wong tak-
ing first-place finishes. Later in the 
year, the dancesport team hosted· A 
Day in Pararuse," a benefit showcase 
in Price Center Ballroom. 

The team is looking forward to 
next year, where it will likely have 
the talent and experience necessary 
to compete nationally. 

DANCE TEAM 
The UCSD dance team, led by 

captain Kanchan Dudani and head 
coach Natalie Adcock, danced this 
year at several national competi-
tions, as well a UCSD sporting 
events, Sun God and Admit Day. 

The highlight of the year was an 
April trip to Daytona, Fla., where 
the team competed in the National 
Cheerleading Association Nationals 
- one of the largest dance compe-
titions in the United States. The 
team finished ranked among the top 
15 tearns in Divi ion n. 

EQUESTRIAN 
The eque trian team had several 

strong performances thi year, with 
several indiVIdual rider competing 
at the national champion hip . The 
team hosted the first competition 
of the year, with UCSD's Lisa 
CalvI no, Linda lbrres and 
Meredith Tosta taking first place in 
individual diviSIOns, while the team 
placed first overall. 

The team hosted another 
English Compeution in February, 
but came m 3 cI~e second place to 
USD. At the Cal Poly Pomona 
Western/English Competition, 

UCSD came out again with many 
individual awards and took home 
the Reserve Champion Team award. 

The team qualified several rid-
ers to compete at the national 
championships in Tennessee, but 
ent only two - Kate McComas 

and Natalie Freeman. For both rid-
ers, it was their first time compet-
ing nationally, but they still had 
notable finishe, with Freeman 
placing ninth in the walk-trot and 
McComas finishing 11th. 

ICE HOCKEY 
The UCSD ice hockey team had 

a successful year, capped by a six-
gamc winning streak in November 
to re-establish their playoff poten-
tial. Lcd by a new head coach, 
UC D alum Reid Hankins, the 
team took some time to get settled. 
But once UCSD found its sync, the 
team was hard to beat. 

After winnmg the lea~lc cham-
pionship three years in a row, the 
Triton were surrounded by high 
expectations. And after starting it 
season 0-3, UCSD \\ as facing an 
uphill battle back to the top. 

. In I ovember, the team traveled 
to Washington state to face four 
schools in four days . Although it 
was a grueling schedule, the Tritons 
responded with inten ity in their 
games. The turning point arrived 
during the game against Walla 
Walla. UCSD came out flat, much 
like they had in the beginning of 
the cason. After an inspiring 
speech by the coaching staff and 
some talk amongst themselves, the 
team re ponded, scoring three 
goals in a IS-second span on the 
way to a 12-6 win. 

The Tritons filushed their regu-
lar eason With a record of 12-6. 
De pite late success, UC D nar-
rowly missed out on a playoff bid. 

MEN'S LACROSSE 
The men's lacrosse team' play-

off dreams ended with a tough bat-
tle and one double-ovcrtime goal by 
Chapman University. Yet the team 
remains proud for its efforts in gain-
ing national attention as an emerg-
ing team with a lot of potential. 

At the start of the season, the 
Tritons quickly realized that they 
had a blend of talent. Senior attack-
man Ross Stensrud was poised for 
competition after struggling with 
past injuries, and UCSD captain 
and defenseman Chris Washington 
had the experience to shutdown 
opponents. The Tritons got a sec-
ond weapon offensively with the 
addition of freshman Nick Dean. 
The team also had a solid backup 
cast, including senior attackman 
Matt LaFiandra, the three midfield 
Bretts (Brett Williams, Bret 
Loughridge, and Brett Northan) 
and goalkeepers Wade Tam, jady 
Hochstein and Matt Etchepare. 

Nationally, UCSD was relative-
ly unknown - unranled in the 
polls and perennial underdogs. 
However, heads quickly turned as 
the upsets began to mount with 
wins over UCLA, Minnesota-
Duluth and Arizona. 

Riding a three-game winning 
streak going into the Western 
Collegiate Lacrosse League quar-
terfinals, UCSD faced Chapman, 
to whom the Triton lost earlier in 
the season by a single goal. History 
would again repeat itself whcn the 
playoff game ended with another 
one-goal win for Chapman, 12-11. 

At the end of the regular season, 
UC D was ranked No.3 in its divi -
sion with a 10-4 record, JUSt behind 
Chapman and national champions 
UCSB. The Tritons were also 
nationally ranked at No. 16, their 
highest fini h ever. 

WOMEN'S LACROSSE 
The women '5 lacrosse team, led 

by captum LlIld ey Reeves, was 
unable to pull out wins this season, 
de pite having a competitIve team. 
UC D finished its season winless 
after everal lose calls again t 

teams Loyola Marymount and 
University of Arizona. UCSD's 
Elaine Lui, Elaine Horowitz and 
Lauren Heintz led the offensive, 
and Amanda Overton, Kim Woo 
a nd Crystal Grover supported the 
team on defense. Despite their sta-
tistical shortfalls, the women's team 
gained experience for the year 
ahead. 

MEN'S RUGBY 
Led by veteran player and cap-

tain Matt Jones, the UCSD men's 
rugby team came Out swinging in 
its first match against UCLA, 
soundly defeating the Bruins 51-II. 
llowever, the season quickly turned 
sour, with several losses to UCSB, 
SDSU and USD. Yet UCSD 
regai ned its con fidence wi th a solid 
36-12 win over Long Beach State 
in February. The Tritons will try to 
rebuild their game in preparation 
for next yea r in the hopes of 
advancing to the playoffs. 

WOMEN'S RUGBY 
It was a memorable year for the 

UCSD women~ rugby team, which 
advanced to the national semifinals 
in 2003 . 

The team, led by captain Abby 
George, finished its regular season 
undefeated. The season began with 
the UCSD-hosted Serum by the 
Sea tournament, where the team 
took first place for the second year 
in a row. Mo t of UCSD's regular 
season games were blowout, 
including an 81-0 win over 
Occidental and a 53-0 win over 
Arizona State. The only team that 
posed a challenge to the Tritons 
was UCSB, in a nail-biting defen-
sive battle that ended with a 5-3 
UCSDwin. 

After a strong regular season, 
UCSD was chosen to host a brack-
et of the national playoffs. In the 
Sweet 16 bracket, solid kicking by 
Kirstin Hartos and a defensive edge 
gave UCSD the win over UNC-
Chapel Hill, 16-10. tn the Elite 
Eight bracket against Dartmouth, 
UCSD was able to pull off its final 
hutout of the year, winning easily 

by a score of 38-0. , 
Yet, the fairy tale year came to 

an end when UCSD suffered two 
losses in the Final Four at tanford, 
losing to Illinois and Penn Srate to 
firu h the year ranked o. 4 in the 
nation . The experience, however, 
will help UC D in the future, and 
one rugby news publication even 
noted that UCSD "is a year away" 
from the national championship. 

SAILING 
The team had its ups and downs 

all eason, but UC D ailing con-
i tently pushed their boating skills 

to the limits. The sea on chedule 
had the team traveling nearly every 
weekend to locations all along the 
California coast, plus one trip to 
Hawaii. Led by captains Chris 
Nilsen, Ryan McDonnell, Jordan 
Meyer and the Var ity -Team of 

ean Anderson and I leather 
Martinelli, UCSD had several 
notable succcsses. Irs highest finish 
came at Y.1I1ejo, Calif., when the 
team took home the third-place 
prize. 

Yet the sailing teams hIghlight 
of the year came not 111 the form of 
a trophy, but rather with the pur-
chase of two new boat> - the first 
fleet addition In o"er five years.

What? 
There's a 
girl sports 

editor? 

Cynthia's 
Corner 

Cynthia Chavez 

I know, I know. What' a girl doing being a sports editor? Well, let me tell you a little 
something. There are many rea-
sons why I think I can do it. When 
I saw UCSD's snappy blue and gold 
uniforms, I just knew I had to be 
sports editor. For example, I love 
going to the beach, so 1 m ow I can 
cover crew and surfing. And after 
watching David Beckham run up 
and down the field during the 2002 
World Cup, I was hooked on soc-
cer too. I would also like to mow if 
I can be an honorary member of 
the women's tennis team, because I 
just have to get my hands on one of 
those adorable skirts they wear; or 
at least learn how to slide and look 
cool doing it, like the softball team 
doe . 

Oh, please. I've heard it all about 
why girls like sports. I'm not some 
hostess who serves fancy appetizers 
during the Super Bowl. I'm one of 
the hardcore fans, glued to the 
couch, yelling and cheering as soon 
as the players run out on the field. I 
watch ESPN, subscribe to Spurts 
Illustrllud and listen to sports radio. I 
grew up playing sports and had Troy 
Aikman, Pete Sampras, Keith 
Tkachuk and David Justice on my 
walls, while other girls had 
Leonardo DICaprio on theirs. I was 
in a March Madness pool this year 
and guess who won? 

Shows like "Dawson's Creek" 
and "The Bachelor" don't even 
hold a candle to "Sportscenter," 
and pretty much any other show 
ESPN has (except for spelling bees 
- not my thing). I live for buzzer-
beaters, tiebreakers, alley-oops, 
suicide squeezes, open-ice checks 
and Hail Mary's. 

I am stoked because being sports 
editOr allows me the opporrunity to 
be surrounded by what I love -
sports. I look forward to standing on 
the sidelines, watching the Tritons in 
both victory and defeat. I think it's 
awesome that over half of the 23 
teams made postseason play - a 
respectable feat for a school that 
doesn't hand out scholarships. Even 
bener, we had 14 teams ranxed 
n nonally, With four 10 the tOP ten 
and a huge Jump for men'~ [enru 
from No. 23 to , o. 13. 

"''Iule It would be great If we had 
scholarsJups, I am glad to be 10 this 
unJque Ituation where the athletes 
play not for the money or presnge, 
but simply beca~ they love Il. And 
these days, nil hard to find athletes 
who are willing to sacrifice uch 
things simply for love of the game. 
And 10 the end it pays. The 
Outstanding Senior Stuelent-Athlete

who are just as successfulm school 
they are in their sport.

UCSD Athletics honor Tritons 
Tritons' Audrey Sung and Kris Chiles shine brightly 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEI 
Staff Writer 

Amidst the rush of studying, review sessions 
and upcoming finals, UCSD athletes took a 
break to attend the UCSD Athletics 
Recognition Night on June 2 at Price Center 
Ballroom. Teams and individual athletes were 
honored for their accomplishments this year. 

The night began with a welcome by 
Director of Athletics Earl W. Edwards. 
Edwards congratulated the athletic program 
and its success in Division II since moving up 
in 2001, saying that UCSD's "excellence in aca-
demics" has translated well to "excellence in 
athletics." He also said he anticipates a top-10 
finish for UCSD in the National Association of 
Collegiate Director of Athletics Sear's 
Director's Cup. 

After Edwards' welcome, Associate Athletic 
Director Ken Grosse handed out the atl-confer-
ence awards. Twenty-five athletes were named [0 
the 2002 -03 All-California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, nine athletes to the 2002-03 Pacific 
Collegiate Swim Conference and two athletes to 
the 2002-03 Western Water Polo Association. 

The men 's and women's swinuning and div-
ing teams had a strong howing in the All-
American selections, taking home 15 of the 26 
awards. Athletes from crew, water polo, cross 
country and track and field also received All-
American awards. In addition, 46 athletes were 
named four-year letterwirUleTS for their four-year 
membership in their respective teams. 

Two NCAA postgraduate scholarships were 
handed Out to cros's country and track and 
field's Audrey ung and to soccer's Kris Chiles

Jordan Cross unveils new athletics plans 
Ne~t A.S. commissioner of athletics steps into office 

ByANU KUMAI 
Sports Editor 

The lack of a school spirit and 
unity is apparent to most Tmons. 
RIMAC Arena is usually as fuJI for 
any sporting event as the campus 
dorms 3re on a long weekend. 
Despite this, the A.S. 
Commissioner of Athletics, 
Jordan Cross, elected In May, is 
continwng the effom of the for-
mer officer, Robm helton, In try-
Ing to change the atutude toward 
sports and Improve the school 
Spirit In m~t of the UCSD tu-

• dent body. 
"'The time to change UCSD 

athletics is now,n Cros saJd . "I'm 
gOing to try to make It more VISi -
ble." 

During ross' one-year term, 
he will focus much of his ume on 
"changing the ambiance" of Triton 
home games. He has been worlong 
with Assistant Athletic DirectOr 

harles Guthrie and DirectOr of 
Sports Faclllues Don ChadWIck to 
mab! the envlfonment of a Tnton 
sportmg event more Intrigumg to 
everyone on campus 

In Just a few weeks of work, 
Cross has organized a UCSD 
cheerleading squad thaI wtll begin 
to attend home games In the fall. 
'There was a team of cheerleader 
on campus, but the group only 
performed 111 competition and 
wouldn 't be seen at RIMA . 

The n w A .. offil..cr Will ~[)(l 

try to make the Triton pcp band, 
which already plays at many 
UCSD games, become more in-
rune with the crowd. Cross said 
the band, wluch usually its on the 
southern ideline at RIMAC, has 
not had enough re ponsibility for 
keeping the Triton fans enthused, 
and he wants to change that. 

Another idea Cross has for 
changll1g the environment of 
UCSD athletic is organiZing the 
~eaung at RIMA Arena . Cross, 
al 0 a JUOlor resident advi or at 
Pepper Canyon Apartment, 
would hke to see a student ecoon 
to aid 10 concentrating the UCSD 
su pporter . [Ie also wan to sepa-
rate the VIsiting and home crowd 
so that each group has a specific 
region of the arena in which to sit. 

Ilowever, in trying to raIse the 
level of spIrit on campus, one 
obstacle that ross WIll face is to 
gather a foundanon of su pporters 
to relay Ius me ~ages. 

"I Ie's going to have to get a 
large base of people," saId 
AssOCIate Athletlc DIrector Ken

ing at the ationals. But as her relationship with Mr. Auster 
grow deeper, ecrets emerge, lea\ing Meg to deal \vitll the real-
ities of life. 

Outlook: "Blue Car" looks to be one of the best films of 
the summer. The plot IS Intere tlllg and it is refreshing to see 
a cOlning-of-age Story thal focuses on somethrng beyond a 
superficial love story. \\'h3t i most appealing about thi film 
is that there appears to be man)' layers; tile meaning isn't im-
pIe. "erall, this film looks beautiful.

is 0pll1lonated and charming, he starts challenging his ideas. 
\\,ith her input, the novel begins to take on a different turn, 
and soon life begins to imitate art. 

Outlook: "Alex and Emma" is set to be the romantic 
comedy of the summer. The actors, especially Luke Wilson,

nitely looks Itke a cute mOVIe, atypical of the usual romantic

Outlook: Every movie season needs its entertaining horror 
film, and "Z Days Later" is set to be the one that rules this 
sununer. The story is inventive, uruquc and is sure to leave 
audiences with a little bit of fear. The filmmakers definitely play 
off humans' fear of the unknown. Tension and suspense are the 
key clements of this film that is sure to be a crowd pleaser.

Madison Lee (Moore), a former ally. 

Outlook: If you enjoyed the first" harlie's Angels," the 
econd one will probably be JUSt as pleasurablc. The plot, 

however, seems to be uninspired. But on the other hand, the 
nlaroal arts sequence as well as the different disguises the 
girls wear Will surely be crowd-pleasmg. And don't forget-
if you're a "Frrends" fan, be sure to look out for Matt

one of the more interesting films of the summer. While 
cri tics have had mixed reactions to tile film overall, no

"there were many things about the first film that were 
unfinished to me."

A metal fan's 
journey into 
the world of 
indie music 

don't pop 
my sheep 

Rinaldo Donnan 

It never fails; I hear about a concert at orne unknown all-ages venue, and, despite my better judgment 
['II find my self knee-deep in a crowd 
of 14- to 16-year-olds. At least this 
time 1 had a somewhat reasonable 
purpo e for howing up : I was going 
for a class. Sparing the details, J 
needed to go with a friend to see a 
show, so we can write about it for a 
literature/writing class. TIlls would 
have been the worst show 1 had ever 
seen if not for the fact that we left 
after the second band. 

Being a heavy metal fan , I have 
relegated myself to the fact that 
there is a lot worth laughing at 
within the metal scene. And like 
any music, when done poorly, 
metal goes very bad. 

Even before I heard a note, all 
signs were pointing toward this 
being a lackluster night. In many 
wa}'S It was, but, since I was with a 
few friends, the experience wasn't a 
total waste as it gave us sometlung to 
laugh at for the rest of the night. 

The show was at J un Java (ever 
a cleverly renamed 'F ucl.: Java' by 

the underage bands that can't get 
any worth whi le venues to play at 
and cons tantly face ge tong barred 
from thei r own or thei r fan 's stupid 
antics), located in a surprisi ngly 
quaint older ection of Chula Vi tao 
As we motored down pas t shops 
and trees decked out In white 
lights, there was a lone crowd of 
young ki ds in black and ratty 
clothe ga thered outside the only 
shop open in an otherwise sleeping 
street. 

Wh at q uickly became clear 
abom this show was the vast major-
i ty of peopl e there were kids from 
C hul a Vista wi th nothing el e to do 
on a Friday mght. There was more 
o a crowd outside at any gi ven 
time than mSlde listemng to the 
musIc - nor that I ca n rea lly blame 
them. Of the th ree bands scheduled 
to play, I only knew about the 
opener, kelator (who [ love to 
hate: the other lime I ~a w kela tor 
at another all-ages venue, the lead 

~lngcr was weanng football che~t 
pads and brandlshll1g a crUSty, 
chipped sword), and thankfully, by 
the lime we arrived we managed to 
nm~ thclr performance entirely. 

Anuther band had Just ~tarted a 
!JdJu~u.:r !oCt, It was a band from 
'liJuJna, \1 c>.Jco, who callcd them-

~ch-cs InfinJlum Obscure for what-
cver reason. The mUSIC was bad, 
un:n.,plfl.:d and way below par. It wa 
the t)l'lcal thmg really - well at 
least as much as I can tell In the 
metal scenc. A band who tn~ to play 
black/dea th and can't do It very well 
Just sound, like mud. 'The band kept 
lna long us laugh with d,eir d(:a th 
metal growb of "check check" every 
LOuple of songs. 

T he next act, evered , I had 
heard about , but never actuall y 
heard . 'The fa ns got way more 
exci ted and the band looked amped 
lO be playm g. Their sound almosl 
gOt me excited but then It qUlcldy 
went Into full suck mode. BOring! 
But I was In a vaSt nunonty as th 
other lads were constantly head-
banging and freaking out as if this 
was the beSt band they had ever 
seen.

Summer music preview: the guide to a rockin' summer 
Ten hot activities to keep your summer months musical 

By BILLY ell 
Staff Writer 

Bad music i all around us, but so is good music. Those blessed with enjoying the 
beautiful weather of Southern 
California this summer will also be 
able to experience some pretty 
amazing musical entertainment. 
Without further ado, here are 10 
music events to ensure your sum-
mer is as rockin' as possible. 

Top Pick - All 
Tomorrow 's 
Parties 

Courtesy at http://hrm.pa~ 
Hot indie : The Breeders Will be one 
among many stellar names to play at 
All Tomorrow's Parties several venues. 

This uberhip annual show has 
recendy been rescheduled to Sept. 
26 to cpt. 28 in three Los Angeles 
venues the Palace , the 
Palladium, and the Henry Fonda 
Theatre. This year's show is curat-
cd by "The Simpsons" crearor 
Matt Groening. Anyone wonder-
ing about his indie credentials 
should remember back to the 
"Hullabalooza" episode of "The 
Simpsons" in which Sonic Youth 
did a noise-rock version of the 
theme song. 

For those not familiar with 
ATP, it started in the United 
Kingdom and has since included 
U.S. shows in recent years. As in 
past years, this year's how features 
a slew of Independent artists both 
new and legendary. 

T he e pt. 26 show mcludes 
trallblaz.i n g punk -poet Paw 

rmth , legendary post- punkers 
The Fall and up-and-coming 
menaces ... And You \.\'ill Know 

s By th e Trail o f D ead . T he 
~epl. 27 show fea tures another 
post-punk legend, Wi re, as well 
as more modern i n dle- rocker~ 
such as The Breeder~, Chlk Chlk 
C hlk and Yo La l engo. NOIse-
ma kers such as Mogwal, The 
Coup and Blonde Red head arc 
featu red on cpt. 28. 

The show's multi-genre, 
multigenerational appeal makes it 
a winner for anyone. Tickets are 
now on sale for $40 for day pass-
es and $ 1 00 for a three-day pass. 

Lollapalooza 
Speaking of Hullabalooza, 

Lollapalooza is back this year 
after a six-year hiatus. The once 
groundbreaking tour, which orig-
inally featured alternative artists 
like Sonic Youth and Smashing 
Pumpkins, ended on a sour note 
as it degraded into a metal-heavy, 
awkwardly organized, bas-
tardized version of the original. 

Well , it's not what it once was, 
but this year's Lollapalooza looks 
like it will at least be a more enter-
taining bastardized version. 

A Perfect Circle, Audioslave, 
Jurassic 5, the Distillers, and 
more join returning headliners 
Jane 's Addiction. The show takes 
place at Coors Amphitheatre on 
August 17.

'Spellbound' synonymous with dramaturgic 
Documentary will bind you to the dictionary 

By BILLY ell 
Staff Writer 

JUSt like at the beginning of any ummer, the movie 
theaters arc currently overrun by "films" sporting little 
more than flashy special effects and cheap laughs. 
Believe it or not, there is a film out there that gener-
ates more genuine excitement than "The Matrix: 
Reloaded," only with more heart and no special effects 
whatsoever. And it's about spelling bees. 

"Spellbound" is just what the doctor ordered for 
those summertime movie blues. Director Jeff Blitz lets 
the audience into the worlds of eight very cool adoles-
cents - some of the best spellers in the nation - as 
they struggle with the pressures of both studying for 
the annllal National Spelling Bee and entering their 
tecnage years. From the first frame of the film where 
motormollth Harry Altman struggles with the word 
"banns," you root for them the whole way. 

Each child brings their own unique story to the 
film , from East Indian eil Kadakia's privileged house-
hold in San Clemente, Calif., to Ashley White's life in 
the black Washington, D .C. projects. The storie are 
told in succession to make up the first portion of the 
film until it's time for the big spelling bee in 
Washington, D .C. Each vignette is artfully told and 
takes up just enough time for the audience to grow 
attached but not become bored. 

Although each child lives in vastly different circum-
stances, they share the [[erculean determination and 
work ethic necessary to complete the daunting tasl.: of 
learning every word they can in the English language. 
The methodology is fascinating, from studying ety-
mologies and language of origin to Kadakia's father 's 
method of researching words used in other competi-
tions and studying in particular the ones that gave oth-

Arenlvar famous for mastenng the lost art of spelling. 

~~---=F~ilm iJE!l REVIEW 
ers problems. 

Even more interesting, of course, arc the individual 
circumstances of each participant. Angela Arenivar, for 
example, didn't learn English until kindergarten (her 
parents arc Mexican immigrants living in Texas). She 
began snldying spelling of her own volition, inventing 
word games and studying with a teacher. 

"At the time, I didn 't understand that excelling in 
the competition meant a great deal to my family," 
Arenivar said . The bee took place in 1999, and 
Arenivar, now a high school student who hopes to go 
to Texas A&M to study medicine, has become some-
what of a celebrity. Looking back on the old footage, 
she first fclt awkward about seeing her eighth grade 
self onscreen but oon realized the importance of her 
own story. 

The excitement builds as each speller's story leads 
them to the national finals where they go head to head 
in an open competition of over 200 finalists . As each 
day progresses, the competitors, including the eight 
introduced in the beginning, are eliminated one by one 
as they face words like "zwieback" and "heleoplank-
ton." It all leads to the final day of competition, where 
the finalists face "championship words" that are seem-
ingly unheard or. 

The competition is genuinely engrossing and ee-
ing each child face the crowd, knowing that the show 
is televised nationally on ESP ,will have audiences on 
the edge of their seats. Rooting for your favorite com-
petitor is omething which Arenivar understands, 
likening the competition to a sporting event. But she 
also reaHzes the deeper truth that the film hints at: 
striving against the odds to meet one's goals. 

"At the time," Arenivar reflects , "I didn't gras p the 
concept that I was living the American dream."

Angelina Jolie is back playing

action hero Lara Croft in the sec-
ond installation of the "Tomb

tionship between violence in 
movies/video games and violence 
in chi ldren? 

Angelina J o lie : Well, as a 

mother, I am very aware of it. 
T here arc certain subtleties to the 
story that 1 try to make sure were 
included. For example, I wanted to 
make sure that the only time she 
ever !cilled anyone was out of self-
defense or to protect a loved one. 

G: Describe your work with the 
United Nations. 

N : It's completely changed me. 
lt's changed my outlook, and it has

To the U.C.S.D. Community: 
I would like to offer my deepest apologies to 

everyone offended by the rush flyers containing KKK 
imagery that appeared around campus during week two 
of this Spring Quarter. This act was in no way associated 
with nor condoned by ANY UCSD fraternity. I 
participated in this heinous prank which was never 
intended to be construed as hateful or threatening toward 
any member of the U.C.S.D. community. However, the 
protests and reactions that ensued after the distribution 
of the fliers vividly illustrated my ignorance and the 
lack of judgment I exercised before partaking in this 
act. Upon realizing that my actions affected a great 
number of individuals on this campus, I have confessed 
my involvement and been held accountable by the 
appropriate UC D administrators. 

Often times, white students who do not experience 
racism directly, such as myself, are oblivious or disregard 
the intolerance many students of color must endure. 
Currently, I am doing my best to remedy the wrongs of 
my actions and I am taking the necessary steps to further 
educate myself on the everyday struggles people of color 
must undergo within our society. Though I wish to 
remain anonymous, please accept my deepest apologies 
for the distress I have caused this campus.

'(.iuberge Espagnole' brilliantly 
mixes culture and diversion 
Lovely French film delights 

audiences with touching story 
By RICHIE LAURIDSEN 

Contributing Writer 

The Amencan college movie has 
become a stereotypical staple of our 
culrure. Full of lewd comments, 
prai sing a party population and 
rebelling against sexual conser-
vati m, the college film attempts to 
embody the . unending festivities 
accompanying higher education. 
Internationally, however, the scene 
seems to be a bit different. 

"L'auberge Espagnole" is a bril-
liant internallonal twiSt to the 
Amencan perception of college lifc.

for answers to questions of trusr,

The title, which translates to 
"The Spanish Inn," is a French 
slang term associared with the mix 
of cultures. The movie epitomizes 
thi multiculrural idea when . avier, 
played by Romain Duris, find 
refuge in tile chaos of a Barcelona, 
Spam, apartment with even room-
mates. Each of the roommates IS of

Column: 
Indie show 

. . . inspires Wise 
words 

conrinued from page B4 
So we did the kvl t~ (metal for 

"cult") thing I could think of doing. 
We left. 

\¥hat was by far the mQst inter-
esting thing about this show was tile 
people at it: this was a .Iike a scene 
from a bad movie where they want to 
make fun of the metal scene. There 
were so many pimply- faced little 
white boys wea'ring b lack meta l 
shi rts, standing around looking like 
they were sufferi ng from scoliosis, 
pot-beUied lecherous men in their 
thirties wi th long hair, big sideburns 
and balding spots, couples lip-locked 
next to the bathroom for the entire 
night. There was even the one cou-
ple where the girl looked about 14 
and the guy about 19. 15-year-old 
boys dressed in aU leather outfits, 
trying so hard to look masculine and 
fai ling. That night I saw the lead 
singer and bassist of Cattle 
Decapitation along with some peo-
ple [ know by face from pictures 
posted on a local metal site, 
http://www.sd71ltlal.org. The guy 
from Cattle looked sufficiently 
bored out of the skulls to make me 
feel like J wasn't the only one not 
enjoying the music. J realized tint 
this how nad very little to do with 
the actual music and had everything 
to do witll creating 3 scene. 

At least I was able to laugh about 
it aU, but when I went and checked 
http://www.sdmeral.org, I saw a forum 
devoted to how cool everyone 
thought the show was, which goes to 
show that hanging around with too 
many minors will just warp your 
sense of a good time. 

On the topic of minors, I've 
learned something, something that 
most everyone should know, but 
apparently some people don't. Sure, 
sex is practically our national past-
time, and Americans spend tons of 
money and ann power on it, but sex 
wi th a minor carries harsh penalties 
behind it. It isn 't worth it. 

I don 't like getti ng letters in 
the mai l from my ex-girlfriend 
beca use she's bei ng accused of 
molesting a minor under the age 
of 14. For some reason, it tends to 
ruin my day. So let me reiterate 
for all t he potentia l mincing 
chi ld-h ung ry pedoph iles out 
there: Sure the lifestyle was glam-
orized by c haracters like Dr. 
Smith and Will Robinson, but in 
rea lity, jail time and bei ng a regi s-
tered sex offender far ourweigh 
any benefits. Trust me.

t he things I've "learned" in col-leg/! ... Revelle College sucks (to 
be fa ir, I would 've said that about 
any college that I'm enrolled in). 
Maximize utility. I don't agree with 
Michael. Perfect way to annoy your 
roommate: the Hampster Dance. 
Vnles you have a predilection for 
food poisoning, never eat at 
Summit." ever slap the Donkey." 

Work hard, play hard. 
Friends come and go, but you 

only got one family. 1y Mom and 
Dad have always been there for me 
since the beginning, giving me sup-
port and hope when J needed it. My 
sister Michel le has always given me 
insight, humanity and a compas-
sionate ear. To my family: Thank 
}'ou for the unconditional love you 
have always given me. 

By the way, it's 101, not the 101. 
And I don't care what you say 
becau e I'm hell a right on this one. 

"'Three's Company' is the best 
show ever!" Don't have a "Fight 
Club" matCh with a guy almost twO 
feet taller than you. Joe Watson 
sucks. Theres nothing better til an 
the Broken Yolk Cafe in the morn-
ing.Jazz is heaven on Earth. Where's 
your Head at? Robert DeNiro is a 
god. All your base are belong to us. 
Robertos carne asada fries are the 
best food to have while inebriated. 

Achieve a Pareto efficient out-
come. In other words, do what you 
have to do to survive, but make sure 
you're not hurting others in the 
process. We all need friendship, e1f-
purpo e and companionship. 
Everyone of us leaves the Earth in 
the sa me manner, so there's much 
more common ground between us 
than we realize. 

SWl God is the most wonderful 
time of the year; don't miss it. My 
gratirude goes to those who come 
out of their shell, party like rock starS 
and aren't afraid to embarrass them-
selves. JUSt wondering, where arc all 
of you the other 364 days of the 
year? Best Sun God memory: 
"aving a guy yell out" ice ratio!" 
to me as three of my female friends 
help me walk back to my aparonent. 

Generally, the term "SoCal 
sports fans" is an oxymoron; these 
bandwagoners show up late, leave 
early and you only see them when 
"their" team happens to make the 
playofli . 

Ilitting the keg in s:o hball is an 
automatic kegstand. 

n a certain day in September, I 
was scared to my bones for the first 
time in my life. 1 10 t some of my 
innocence that day, and I'll never 
be quite the same. 

Margina l cost equals marginal 
revenue. Les Mis is the best musical 
ever. We need a universal health care 
system; every human being deserves 
the inalienable right of life. I don't 
care what people say, I still think 
"Epi ode II" is a good movie. 
"'Marmalade' inevitably leads to 
Paddington Bear." Go (0 the opera 
at least once in your life. 

Mr. Jack Daruel i my best (and 
worst) friend. 

Vegas, baby! Vegas! Al though 
these trip have been a blur at 
time, I've had some of the beSt

n ights of my life in this city of 
esca pism. T he neon lights, the 
flashy shows and the noise emanat-
ing from the slot machines is the 
college equivalent of a kid being in 
a candy store. I wi ll always cherish 
the time spent with my friends 
gambling, drinking and being com-
pletely carefree for a weekend. 
Some Vegas tips: the Aladdin sucks, 
always bel on black, let it ride, don't 
go into the Bellagio if you're 17, 
watch the fountains "all night long" 
and O'Sheas is your top for $1 
"food" if you gambled all your 
money away. Penny slots! 

You must be the change you 
wish to see in the world . How is it 
that Adam Sandler in "Punch-
Drunk Love" has such a profound 
effect on me? "The Simpsons" is 
the be t television show ever 
(except for the new seasons) . 
"\¥hats another word for miscon-
ception? A stillborn." Generally, 
the only thing AS. Council mem-
bers care about is themselves. 

Love is the best of all emotions. 
Love is the worst of all emotions. 

Have one thing you love and put 
all your heart into it. College can 
be a roller coaster of emotions, and 
yet through it all, I still have one 
constant love: the GUIlrdian. I have 
never been associated wi th such a 
group of ambitious, fun, caring and 
thoughtful human bei ngs until I 
joined the GUIlrdian. People ask me 
how I can absorb all the stress and 
hand le the sacrifices that I've made . 
Am I glutton for pain? Why do I 
put up with it? 

It's for the love. It's the love of 
not only disseminating news to 
UCSD, but it's also the love of the 
people you work with. \Vhen you 
have a group of peQple who really 
care about the work they do, every-
thing that happens at the office isn 't 
work - it's something much 
grander and more fulfilling. From 
being maliciously attacked at an 
A.S. meeting to staying until dawn 
because of a computer crash, it's the 
devotion of what we love that keeps 
us going. For all the people I've 
worked with the past four years, I 
wouldn't nave it any other way. 
Thank you for putting up with me 
and I will always cherish the mem-
ories that we had together. It is the 
love of what we call the Guardian 
that ha kept me going these past 
four years. 

"Sapere aude" i Latin for "dare 
to know." And de pite my be t 
attempts to ignore my humanitie 
courses, it's the one thing that I've 
gotten out of them t hat I wi ll 
remember. It's funny how I entered 
UCSD: Believing that I knew 
exactly everything about myself 
and what I wa nted to do. But as a 
grad uate, I only know o ne thing: I 
know nothing about myself and 
about thi world. No one ever said 
life was easy, but you wake up 
everyday, take in everything and 
you make one small step further 
down that journey we call life, nd 
that's the beauty of life, you don't 
know where you're going, but you 
go on discovering wha t it's all 
about and, hopefully, the best is yet 
to come. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

•••••• •• 
f or the last six years, I've lived the life of a journalist, ever striving toward the ideal of tile 
naked man on top of a mountain far 
above everything else, shouting 
only what he see and adding no 
commentary. 

Some may question adding the 
nudity qualification to the life of a 
journalist, but if there is one thing 
that I've learned over the past six 
years, it is that a journalist is as 
naked as they come. Wearing no 
clothes for fear of a brand name 
being construed as bias. Wearing no 
clothes to leave ones proverbial 
junk floating in the breeze, ope n 
and exposed to anyone wanting to 
take a hack. A journalist finds him-
self ever cold because nobody ever 
offers him a blanket when he suc-
ceeds at his job. The only feedback 
the journalist gets comes in the 
form of a vicious machete swipe at 
his junk when he messes something 
up. 1lUs is the life I have chosen to 
lead the past six years . 

Whoa, hold the fuckin ' phone! 
Have I gotten bitter or what? I 
haven't always been this cynical, 
have I? It must have been the 
blood-sucking savages this year, 
shouting for my head on a pike for 
telling the truth. Ignorant bastards. 
Ah well, freedom of speech and all . 
But deep-seeded ranting comes 
from somewhere deeper than JUSt 
letting the Mob get me down. I 
wonder where it came from ... 

Cue flashback. 
I was a bright-eyed 16-year-old 

looking for an easy job. The Turlock 
JOlln1l11 was hiring a sports writer. 
"Me know spons. Me know writ-
ing," I thought. 1lUs job was made 
for me. Two years and 10,000 Little 
League games later (yes, that 
includes dealing with parents at 
10,000 Little Le:tgue games-<lon't 
get me started), I was a full-fledged 

news writer for the paper lovingly 
nicknamed the Turlock UriTIIJI. 

Suddenly I had responsibility, 
which sucked. I tried to fake my 
way through most of it, but I unin-
tentionally started to learn sruff, 
both about the profession and 
myself. Ain't that a bitCh? 

In addition to covering sporting 
events, I also got to cover orne 
mind-blowing shit that has sruck 
with me throughout my young life. 
I was at the scene of a fatal accident 
and watched a woman breathe her 
last breath. I interviewed a 6-vear-
old girl with cancer who gave ~Ie a 
hug when I left. he died hortly

a s much a I like to talk about myself, you might be surprised to learn that I 
hate writing abou t myself. 
Perhap , it would be easier to do 
right now if I knew where I was 
going, but as it turns out, 1 find 
my elf in an utter tate of limbo. 
Thi mayor may not make for 
good journalism, but indulge me. 

I am surrounded by a group of 
exrremely ucce ful individuals 
who arc either off to further 
their education or t:lke a job in 
their field of tudy. As for the

news writer, became news editor

anyway). My work at the Guardiall

• n the grand tradition of three 

I facets of a end-off, I will be tackling the sacred trinity of 
advice, saying thank-you and 
remembering, but be forewarned: 
The holSIC problem with almost 
anything that is gOIng to be aid in 

the~e end-offs is that the humor 
\l'tll not mean anythlllg to you as 
the general UC D reader, since 
we are essentiall), writing to our-
sel"e~, our friends and the other 
GilaI'd/OIl geeks. 

Quite frankly you are the 
problem with this campus. 
Rather then seizing upon the 
opportunity to live like a jackass 
and make the most of your rime 
in college, you end up forgetting 
about life and blindly plunging 
inro your school work for four 
straight years. Being in school 
means that you hould treat your 
grades as the most important 
thing in your life right now, but 
not the only thing. \Vhy squan-
der away your adole cence with a 
bio or econ book' But that is 
another tirade, one that I have 
alread)' partially gone into. 

The thing about any school, 
e\'en UCSD, is that it is only as 
mteresting or boring as you make 
ir. \ Vhat J most appreciate now, 
fi,'c rears after tarttng here, is 
gening tnvolved (f've been with 
the Guardian for three years) and 
ha"ing left an impression, howe,'-

Do yourself a fa"or and )Olll a

\,ourself another fa"or at the same

for that later.

so it comes down to this. For the past year and a half, I've been able to do my best to 
cover spons both at UCSD and in 

an Diego. Maybe it sounds like 
I'm bragging or something, but 
during my short time here I've 
had the opportunity to participate 
in and cover so many sports and 
events. 

I learned so much about sports 
like crew and water polo at 
UCSD. For the GU8rdian, I even 
gOt a chance to interview video 
game heroe like Mat I loffrnan 
and Andy MacDonald. 

In San Diego, I got an oppor-
tunity to live dreams. Working at 
XTRA Spons 690, I got a chance 
to meet most of my favorite radio 
and sports personalities and even 
be on the radio once a week. 
Interning with the San Diego 
Gull, I not only got a chance to 
walch hockey games for free from 
the press box, but also learned 
about how professional teams are 
run. 

When r got to school and real-
ized I wouldn't be playing any 
intercollegiate sports, I turned to 
intramurals. Three years ago, 
myself, Kurt and Todd started a 3-

like this is pretty typical of me. It is 
weIrd to Sit down and write an arti-
cle to be publi hed in the UCSD 
Guarditm, even though I've worked 
here for nearly four full years. In all 
that time, the only thing I have writ-
ten for the GuardilnJ was a two-para-
graph concert review of the Jack 
Johnson concen at USD in October 
2001, for the hiatus section. Even 
then, I had a hard time writing it 
(mostly because the space they gave 
me was so damn small). It was prcl-
ty cool though, because tile concert

the photo editor of this little news-
paper. 

Being a photographer has given 
me some amazingly good times. It is 
a trip to thinlc. that when you take a 
picture for the Guardian, you arc 
going to be shOwing that image to 
11,000 people. You are making it so 
clut people who couldn't go to the 
Sun God concert, that protest or a 
championship soccer match get a 
frOnt row image of what it was like 
to be there. 

When you go to cover an assign-
ment, you get to see and be places 
most people would never get to be. 
I've been in the security pit of COll-
eens more times then I can count 
I've seen athletes that give it all they 
have for 12 people in the stands. 

Through it all, I have taken 
photos for the love of it. I till 
remember when r first applied to 
be a photographer at the GUIlrdlan, 
I didn't even know we got paid. 
Regardless, what little money they 
pay us here ha been nice, but the 
real payment wa being able to ee 
and be places that I'd never have 
the opportunity to be otherwl e. 

These 'senior send-offs' amuse 
me. They arc always a mix betweel1 
advice, thanks, shout-outs, rants 
and sheer recycling of what other 
editors have aId In previous senior

THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPECIAL GRADUATION I UE Bli 

....,~~..... I' ••• , • 
Crouse: Graduating editor in chief reflects and says goodbye to UCSD 

continued from page B9 
Gena taught me how to look at the 
whole story and relate it to the read-
er. Mikey taught me not to take shit 
from anyone, no matter how much 
bigger they are than you. Donny ... 
well, he taught me that there are 
some sites on the Internet that I wish 
I could erase from memory. 
Coincidenrally, he was recently 
pinched on charges of attempting to 
bed a l4-year-old honey from 
online. Go figure. 

Fast-forward to freshman year at 
UCSD. The setting? None other 
than the illu trious Guardian office. 

I walked into the office as the 
cockiest bastard you'd ever want to 
meet. To me, the GIIllrditm would be 
lucky to have me on staff. I was such 
a prick. 

Fortunately, the first person that 
I met on the paper was even more of 
a cocky prick, so when he introduced 
me to everyone else, I seemed nor-
mal by comparison. It was in that 
fate-fi lled moment that I encoun-
tered Jessica "No, I'm not a femi-
na7.i and I'm definitely not high on 
crack" Scheppmann. She hired me 
out of desperation, and I wanted to 
ravage her sexy body out of despera-

tion. It was a match made in the 
G1IIIrditm, a phrase that would come 
up surprisingly often for me over the 
following four years. 

To my great shock, the lesson 
in life didn't end in the Urinal. 
T he Guardian arguably had more 
of an impact on my life than 
Adolphus, Pete, Jack, Jose and 
Johnny (the lords of liquor for the 
un.initiated). It was during my 
four-year sti nt at the G that I 
found love, lost it, learned to 
loathe the ignorant, laughed my 
ass off and was raid that roll ing 
bread down a hallway while spray-
ing shaving cream on the walls of 
the Aladdi n hotel was unaccept-
able behavior, even in Las Vegas. 

The actual work that I did at the 
G (the amount of which is currently 
up for debate) was surprisingly ful-
filling. To be perfectly honest, I did-
n't expect much when I applied. It 
was just something that I was good at 
and could get me some extra coin. 
Despite being the arrogant pricle. 
that he was, Marc was extraordinari-
ly good at what he did. I've learned a 
lot from the head honchos since him 
as well.

showed me that you didn't have to 
be a prick to be good at what you 
do. Ali No-No taught me not only 
that sometimes you have to detach 
yourself from work, but that you 
can't tru ly judge who a person is 
unti l you talk to them outside of 
work. Jeff taught me that busting 
gear is a true art form . The four of 
you have had more of an impact 
on me than you know, both who I 
am as an editor and who I am as a 
person. Thanks. 

One of the most surprising things 
that I learned during my sentence at 
the G was that work could be fun. 
Not only was the actual paper satis-
fying, but the social scene and tight-
knit community of co-workers wa 
truly an inspiration. I truly consider 
a lot of you to be family. Yes, I am 
getting sappy, but bear with me. 
Even when I was super-stressed and 
a giant asshole of a boss, y'alJ kept 
me grounded and lovin' life and 
work. Thank you. 

Fade back to present ... 
I guess, things haven't been so bad 

over the years. On the whole, there 
have been way more good times than 
bad. Unfortunately, the bad ones just 
seem to stand out a little more.

Before I end this Homer-esque 
odyssey, there are some personal 
shout-outs that need to be made 
lest I be remiss in my duties. 

First and foremost, to the man 
known simply as Bill. You've been 
a great friend and mentor. I must 
thank you for leading me through 
the most insane quarter of my 
entire life. To this day, I'm not 
sure how we (or our livers, for that 
matter) survived. You've also been 
there with me to see the sun rise 
in Vegas (you know it's sad when 
people are calling you degenerates 
in Vegas). You're living proof that 
a guy can work hard and pla y 
hard . You've also helped me 
through some rough times . 
Thanks for always being there. 

To Sir Charles and Princess 
Lauren, y'aU have been awesome this 
year. I can't imagine getting through 
the year without you two. Charlie, 
you've been a great friend and co-
worker over the years. You've been 
the voice of reason that has kept me 
alive and a free man on several occa-
sions. I 'IJ try not to oppress you tOO 
much. Lauren, you've been the 
bright spot in many of my days. 
Thanlc.s. 

Evan, the paper is in your 
hands now. We've had some good 
times over the past couple of 
years. Don't forget to pass those 
times on to the new kids. Don 't lct 
them forget that some things are 
more important than work. 

While work has been at the 
forefront of my life for the past, I 
couldn't have gotten through the 
last four years without the love 
and suppOrt of my family. 

Mom and Dad, you twO have 
always been there when I needed 
you and even when I didn'r. I love 
you guys with all my heart, and 
thank you with all my hean and 
then some. Ashly, what's crack-a-
lackin' g-funk? I love you, dawg. 
You've had my back from day one. 
I guess havin' a sister ain't so bad 
after all. I love you and am very 
proud of you. 

So, that's just about it. It's time 
for me to grab a suit, tuck my 
proverbial junk into the relative 
safety of my boxers and bid this 
life of journalism adieu. It's a lot 
harder than I thought it would be, 
but we'll always have Vegas. 

P.S . To everyone else that 1'lIl

B 12 SPECIAL GRADUATION ISSUE THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2(0) 

• • , wt"-.HWI 

••••••••••••••••• maryam banihashemi 
O K, OK. I know what you're all thinking: The UCSD GUIlrdian? What a friggin' 
nerd convention. And it's true. 
There is an unhealthy amount of 
nerdiness that exi t within the 
Guardian offices. I, however, am 
entitled to make thi judgment 
since I am the nerdiest of them all 
(mirror, mirror, on the walli) 

Hi, my name is Maryam, and I 
was a UC D Gllal'd,an copy editOr. 

I left the G b t year, 0 I'm not 
going to ramble abom how won-
derful the paper 15 and how I ca n 't 

~tand to hve wIthout It - because 
whIle It wa~ a great opportumty 
for me, I've moved on and I'm 
happier for it. 0 in the following, 
you will find random thoughts on 
my time as a TritOn . For tho e 
who are lactOse intOlerant, you 
may want to Stop reading. There's 
a pretty huge amount of cheese 
headed your way. 

There are three importanr 
Ie son r have learned in the past 
four years: 

I . I 0 matter where you go, you 
are going to meet people who suck 
and who WIll screw you over if you 
let them. Don't let them.

haIr erum will cut your hair-
stralghtentng time in half, guaran-
teed. 

3. All problems can be solved 
through a VIewing of "Cluele s." It 
ha erved as my ocial bible and 
gotten me out of many soc~'Y situa-
tions. Thanks, Cher. 

LIke most seniors I know, I am 

totally trippin' about our impend-
ing graduation. It's not that I'm 
afraid that I will wind up on the 
streets hungry or that I feel I have 
wasted my time here. Actually, 
quite the opposite. I know that I 
will find happiness in my field 
(thank you, communication 
department) and I know that I 
have squeezed all I can out of my 
UCSD experience. This is pre-
CIsely why I am so sad to leave. 

" I strongly urge younger 
readers of the 'I hate 
UCSD' persuasion to 

realize the paradise you 
live in, and weU quit 
whining ... I feel so 

privileged to have spent 
the last four years here." 

I know how lucky I am to be a 
UCSD student. I went from a 
tragicall y insecure freshman to 
copy editor at the G and a UCSD 
tour guide, selling the school to 
prospective students every day. 
Friends always ask how I can tand 
to lie to people all the time about 
how wonderful our campus is . 

The fact is I'm not lying. I have 
truly come to love this university, 
and I am sad to be sayin g goodbye 
to it. 

I had my "San Diego rocks" 
epiphany during my time a an 
intern at Walt Disney World ea rli -
er this year. It was a great experi-
ence, but one day I found myself in 
Orlando standing by a swamp 
(they're like Starbucks down there 
- one on every corner), caught in 
the rain, sticky with humidity and 
willing to give my left ann for an 
In- -Out burger, I rcali2.ed just 
how good we all have it in SD. I'm 
glad that I had this realization 
before r become a bitter, unfash-
ionable graduate student, and I 
strongly urge younger readers of 
the "I hate UCSD" persuasion to 
realize the paradise you live in, and, 
well, quit whining. There are peo-
ple in Eas t Armpit, Iowa, who 
would drop their potato sacks in a 
second to be where you are. I feel 
so privileged to have spent the last 
four years here. 

I hate to make this an Academy 
Award acceptance speech, but we 
all know that's where it's headed . 
Mom and Dad, you have made me 
who I am today and I am proud to 
be your daughter. Thank you for 
your patience, your sacrifices and 
for not being the typical Persian 
parents and actually letting me 
study something other than engi -
neering or biology. And my sister 
Fatemeh, you are the most gener-
ou per on I know. Thank you for 
all of your kindness, support and

thing out there for you and a way 
to meet people and make this way-
too-massive campus a little small -
er and more personable. Of 
course, the easiest way \Iould be 
to S" Itch majors to something 
where the average class SI2.C is less 
then 100. 

Anyway, now that I've gotten 
that out of the way, let me shift 
gears and talk about something 
much closer to all our hearts: Las 
Vegas. 

Vegas. I t always comes back to 
Vegas, espeCIally with the 
GuardIan. After all the many de~­
unations I 've gone to WIth all the 
dIfferent people I 've traveled 
WIth, the one we've all gone to, 
the place that gets the largest 
crowds and the most interesting 
memori es is that odd city In thl! 
middle of fuckin ' nowhere. 

Las Vegas is the proving 
grounds for new members of our 
staff, all are welcome, but only 
those with a future ever really 
come. After five hours or so in a 
car with a handful of people and 
then spending a weekend trying to 

look of age In the caSInOS (or per-
haps, like Vince, evading "the bad 
men"), Vegas has a way of creating 
la ting bonds between people. I 
mean there was nothing like the 
ome I sat around with Jessica and 
Greg, who I only really met hours 
before, making endless dead 
hooker jokes. 

" Vegas. It always comes 
back to Vegas, especially 
with the Guardian ... 

Las Vegas is the proving 
grounds far new 

members of our staff. " 
Of the several Vegas trips I've 

gone to, there are many infa-
mous and greatly talleed about 
events: the time I passed out next 
to the bathtub and almost mus-
tered enough to make it to din-

ner; the time we woke to find 
Josh cuddling a bottle of 
Windex; and many more inter-
esting dealings that I don't feel 
like making up pseudonyms for. 
It's always fun - well mostly-
bur it is always something to 
remember. 

Lastly, I'd like to take to 
opportunity to thank everyone 
who has made my lengthy five 
years here worth so much: mom, 
dad, grandma, those gun-toting-
rednecle-wannabes that [ went to 
hjgh school with and their girl -
friends otherwise known as "the 
Group" (even you who aren't red-
necks, but just own swords) and 
everyone at the GuardIan for 
putting up with me for the last few 
years. 

There really are too many peo-
ple to thank and tOO many memo-
ries to talk about, but let me just 
say this: Don't screw this up 
because now all you have to loole 
forward to is a job. 

Crap! I need to get a job. 
Well, fuck me gently with a 
chai nsaw, time to apply to grad 
school.

Many students find them -
selves counting their last few dol-
lars as school winds down , so they 
seek out summer jobs and 
intern hips to gain money 
and experience. 

Unlike the good 
days where summer 
was meant only for 
play and not work, 
during college 
many are deter-
mined to rid 
themselves of the 
title "starving stu-
dent." 

"I think that 
once you've got-
ten to college I_"~_"'" 
you realize how L~~~1I1 
far dollar 
doesn't go," said 
Revelle College 
freshman 
Stephanie 
Tsukamoto. "I 
will therefore be 
working 40 hour a week 
again this summer. I hate 
my job but it pays decently, so I 
can't complain tOO much ." 

Along with a paycheck, sum-
mer jobs also provide students 
with work experience that can 
boost a resume and also teach 
valuable skills. 

"Last summer, I worked at 
Nordstrom. They really ~tres~ 
the importance o f customer ser-
vice, so r had really good training 
in customer relations," said Earl 
Warrren College sopho m ore 

C arri e Lew. 
Certain job or internships 

also give students academic 
credi t for working, which i~ 
another plus to

summer Jobs are, 

obta inmg one IS not 
easy. 
"There are lim ited 

opportunities nowadays 
and it makes it morc diffi-
cult now to find a summer 
job. Because of how our 
economy is now, em ploy-
ers cannot afford to hire 
someone temporarily and 
retrain someone else to 
take their sPOt," did 
Employment 
Development Department 
employee Dora Luna . 

Resources for tinding 
summer jobs are fairly 

plentiful, despite limited job 
opportunities. UCSD's Career

"I'd advise other students to ask 

around and see if thcrc arc any 
openings. The key is action. If you 
don't take the initiative, then you're 
stuck in a rut," Lew aid. 

Many employers start accept-
ing applications even before thc 
school year ends. Luna suggests 
that students starr looki ng before 
they're cven Out of school to meet 
deadllllcs that the employer rna)' 
have. 

After findmg that perfect Job, 
one needs ule ski lls and qualities to

For those determined to find 
summer employment in the field of 
their interest, certain guidelines 
should be followed . 

"Assertiveness and energy arc 
important. Direct contact with 
employers of interest, regardless of 
seeing posted openings, i highly 
advisable in tough economic 
nmes," Roberts said. 

"Also, smart job seekers spend a 
lot of time networking, asking 
those they know for advice and job 
leads." 

Lew agrees, recounting her own 

Internships make It easier for 
students to find Jobs related to their 
interest and arc often geared 
toward students. 

The Web site. brrp:llmtrnl-
SblpS.wftfut.co7ll , is a valuable 
resource based purel}' on intern-
ship, paid and non paid, III a vanety 
of fields. 

Inroads, at 
bttp://w=.mroads.org, is a nonprof-
it organization that trains and 
develops talented young people of 
color for professional careers in 
business and industry by placing 
them in internships. 

So while some students hit the 
books or hit the waves this summer, 
others will get a taste of the "real 
world" by ecuring a summer job or 
internship.
