UCSD engineer wins 
presidential award 

Frieder Seible, assistant 
professor of applied mechanics 
and engineering sciences at 
UCSD since 1983. has been 
named a winner of a Presidential 
Young Investigator Award by the 
National Science Foundation 
( SF). 

The awards. which can be up 
to $100 ,000 per year for a five 
year period. were given to 100 of 
the most promising young 
scientists and engineers around 
the country. Seible was the only 
UCSD fa culry member to win the 
award this year and one of the 
only three winners in the UC 
system 

Seible. a srructural engineer. is 
one of the deSigners of the 
Charles Lee Powell Structural 
Testing Laboratroy that recently 
opened on the Warren Campus. 
The laboratroy provides 
researchers with a unique faciliry 
capable of testi ng eanhquake 
resistance in buildings up to five 
stories tall . 

The Young Investigators 
Awards are used to fund 
reserachers near the beginning of 
their careers and to help 
uni versities attract and retam 
outstanding young Ph.D.'s who 
might otherwise pursue non-
teaching careers. according to 
the NSF. 

Dean appointed for 
Pacific Rim school 

Peter A. Gourevltch. professor 
of political science at UCSD has 
been named acting dean of the 
campus' new Graduate School of 
International Relations and 
Pacific Studies, until a permanent 
dean is named. 

Gourevitch chaIred the

campus steering committee 
which prepared the academic 
fo undations for the new shcool, 
approved by the UC Board of 
Regents at their January meeting. 
The school is the first in the 
country to focus on the Pacific 
Basin. 

Gourevitch, whose field of 
research includes international 
relations and comparative 
politics, has been a member of 
the UCSD faculty since 1979. He 
holds a Ph.D. in political sCIence 
from Harvard Universiry and was 
on the faculties at McGill 
Universiry in Montreal and at 
Harvard before coming to UCSD. 

Opening in the fall of 1987. 
the school will train students for 
professional careers in public-
and private-sector organizations 
that deal with the rapidly 
developing Pacific region . Such 
careers include diplomacy, policy 

an~lysis and communications. 

Blumenthal discusses 
the life of Maimonides 

Dr. David R. Blumenthal, 
holder of the endowed chair in 
JudaiC Studies at Emory 
Universiry, will deliver the 
second of the three Maimonides 
lectures sponsored by the Judaic 
Studies Program at UCSD on 
Tues., May 6. 

Blumenthal, chairperson of the 
department of religion at Emory, 
will speak on "Maimonides -
Astrophysicist, Philosopher and 
Mystic" at 7:30 pm in Liewbow 
Auditorium at the School of 
Medicine. AdmIssion IS free . 

The senes honors the 850th 
anniversary of the birth of one of 
the greatest Jewish intellectuals, 
Moses Maimonides. Although 
Maimonides, who lived from 
1135-1204, is best known as a 
rabbinical scholar, he was also a 

phYSician, philosopher, mystic, 
writer and an astrophysiCISt. The 
lecture series examines these Ie s 
well-known aspects of his life . 

UCSD to commemorate 
Holocaust victims 

The Union of Jewish Students 
and the Israeli Action Committee 
are celebrating Holocaust 
Memorial Day on Tuesday. May 
6 at Revelle Plaza by honoring 
the II million who died . 

From sunrise to sunset, a 
partial list of the victims will be 
read. A reading of the entire list 
would take 200 days. Professors, 
srudents and representatives 
from student organizations will 
read the names and make 
speeches between 12 and 1 pm. 

SDSU fraternity 
punished for rape 

Twenty-nine members of Pi 
Kappa Alpha fraterniry have been 
punished for offenses stemming 
from a November party at which 
a sororiry pledge claimed she 
was raped , San Diego State 
Universiry announced Friday. 
anctions against the 29 men 

included letters of censure, 
probation terms, expulsion from 
SDSU and permanent 
banishment from all California 
State U niversiry campuses. But 
universiry officials refused to say 
how many men received each 
penalry. 

After an invesrigation, campus 
police said they believed three 
men had sexually assaulted the 
Delta Gamma sororiry member 
while other men watched 
through a window or from places 
in the room. Fraterniry members 
maintained that the woman 
voluntarily had sex after drinking 
alcohol and smoking marijuana. 

In the wake of the scandal, 
which brought SDSU national 
notoriery, the universiry's 16 
remaining fraternities voted for 
policies establishing a non-
alcoholic recruitment or "rush" 
week and limiting panies that 
are open to all students.

Earthquake lab dedicated r---- .er vo contr o l I.d hydraul Ie a c tuatora 
By CHERYL CARTWRIGHT. Staff Writer 

At a ceremony yesterday, the materials such as steel, concrete 
new $4 million Structural Systems or wood. Computers including 
Laboratory at UCSD used for UCSD's Cray X-MP/48 
earthquake studies, was Supercomputer, will model all 
dedicated to Charles Lee Powell. these parameters, according to 

It is the only such facility in 
the United States and the largest 
of only two in the world. 

Presently only scale models are 
tested in the United States. At 
UC Berkeley, a one-story 
building can be tested, but the 
Powell st ructure will begin testing 
one-story buildings and work up 
to five story structure s. The 
results of a full-scale earthquake 
will not be Simulated for another 
one and one-half to 2 years. 

"The testing is like a first /light 
test for buildings. Eanhquakes 
come in frequently, they are not 
contro:led environments," said 
Dr. Gilbert Hegemier, director of 
the laboratory and U~SD 
professor of applied mechanics 
and engineering sciences, in a 
press conference Thursday. 
"Because there are many 
different kinds of eanhquakes, 
we will be able to select a sui te 
of representative eanhquakes," 
he said . 

Many variables must be 
examined in eanhquake studies. 
Building with different shapes 
will suffer different damages 
during an earthquake. 
Earthquakes also diversely affect 
building made of various 

Hegemier. 
The testing cemer consists of 

a reaction wall 50 feet in height 
and 30 feet in width on a test 
Door of 120x50xJ with a 
maximum moment capacity of 
135,000,000 feet per pound. 
Structures to be tested will be 
attached to the reaction strong 
wall by 15 hydraulic actuators , 
each having a capacity of 
220,000 pounds. 

"With our lab we can actually 
get the behavior of the building 
as it reacts to a simulated 
earthquake over time . That is the 
key point. This type of 
information is extremely dlfTicult 
to obtain from scaled-down 
model tests ," Dr. Freider Seible . 
associate director of the lab and 
assistant AMES professor, said. 

The results of the full -scale 
testing of repair techniques will 
be especially helpful in deciding 
if old buildings, considered safe 
under the seismic codes of a 
decade ago but which may not 
be deemed earthquake proof 
under today's standards. can be 
rectified or should be tom down. 
In the Powell laboratory, the test 
building will be stressed, 
repaired and then restressed and 
repaired several times 

The facility will not only test 
the actual building, but will also 

analyze the design and the 
method. ' We have very little data 
to go on to tell us whether our 
theoretical computer modeling is 
doing the job or not," Hegemier 
said. "These big tests are 
intended to validate our 
theoretical procedures. The 
question is , how are these 
simulation models doing? Are 
they doing a good job or are 
they totally off the mark?"

"The kind of large-scale tesu ng 
we will be able to do here just 
can't be done in this country 
right now," Hegemier said. "To 
find a similar facility , one has to 
go aU the way to Tsukuba City in 
Japan." [ill Schemallc drawin~ oj the Charles L. Powell StYUClural restin)! Laboratory.

Inheriting anger, 
looking for peace 

When we begin to see violent peace-actions we must 
question whether or not we have forgotten our ultimate 
goals. Last week, a student protestor hurled red paint at 
an ROTC recruiting table to symbolize the viscious, war-
making, blood-shedding and discriminatory policies of 
the military establishment. His action was supposed to 
raise the consciousness of the student body to the ills of 
military actions. He says that he wants peace and 
freedom for oppressed groups, and, in order to attain it, 
he infringed upon the rights of seve real students sitting 
in Revelle Plaza. He damaged their clothing without ever 
attempting to communicate to them constructively the 
meaning and purpose of his cause. His was anger 
expressed carelessly and thoughtlessly. His was an 
action without a vision of the future . 

Thus far, the university administration has refused to 
respond to a particular moral issue: removing recruiters 
and research for war-making agencies from the campus. 
According to Joe Watson , student referenda are merely 
"advisory," and the administration's primary call is to 
enforce the university's rules and poliCies. Such 
thinking has compelled student action against 
univerSity functions. It seems that the regents will 
answer students concerns about changing the 
university'S political agenda only if the daily activities of 
its many administrators are disrupted. 

Protesting increases the possibility for student 
awareness about important political and moral 
questions. Without publicity of some sort, many of us 
forget to concern ourselves with those questions. 
Daycare for children of students did not become 
available on this campus until mass demonstrations 
encouraged all students to become involved in the issue. 
Democracy is founded on popular participation in 
government, and civil disobedience, a disruption of 
daily practices, forces the whole populace to actively 
take a stand on the issues of the day. We must never 
forget our interest in the policies of our government. 

Civil disobedience is a peaceful means to elicit 
change, but it should not be, as it seems to be now, an 
action in and for itself. Unfortunately, the protests we 
have recently seen on this campus have muddied rather 
than cleared the way for' critical political thought by the 
populace. 

When we substitute ideological stances for moral 
' righteousness, our thinking and actions become 
dangerous. Everyone of us has a particular moral 
agenda, but in order to correctly assess and change the 
ills of our society, we must be prepared to fit our idyllic 
plans to the problems of the real world. Separatism and 
separatist thinking have no place in working for social 
change. There are many different ways to express 
awareness and participate protest. Rallies are art 
immediate answer, but we all must learn to integrate our 
work for justice into our work in the world. Our own 
administrators have proven to us that it is easy to 
become uncaring and ignorant of social ills once we 
have settled into our work, but we must make a 
concentrated effort to address social and political 
problems through our work. And we must learn to 
accept the lasting, less dramatic works of others in the 
effort to raise consciousness. 

We must avoid dictating the form of perfect SOciety. 
Creating a society is a collective effort. It is one of 
cooperation .in the highest sense. We cannot merely 
create another clique with a new set of ideals. Creating 
good society is understanding the needs and 
constructive works of others. It is the product of mutual 
correction. It is the result of conscientious effons to 
work with and for each other. If the cause is truly just , 
there is no need to convince others by dictating ideals to 
them . Patient education will bring about true changes in 
th inking. DogmatiC violence only builds walls against 
the truth .

Jumbling justice 
Editor. 

I once believed in the land of 
freedom . the land of justice , the 
land of human rights. I once 
believed that America was right 
even when it was wrong. I once 
was like Schnaubelt (author of 
the letter "Questioning the 
Truth ," April 28). quick to rattle 
off unethical arguments, quick to 
defend America when critical 
analysis was needed. I once was 
a child. 

I am nOt a democrat, a 
conservative . or some left- or 
right-wing advocate. But I am a 
proponent of truth and the 
admission of ignorance of the 
truth when the presentation 01 
facts are so jumbled we cannot 
possibly know what is going on. 
I once stood blindly on the 
pages of newspapers printing 
empty rhethoric. I once believed 
in standing behind a smile of 
patriorism and I had pride to be 
in a land that promotes freedom 
and justice for all. I once thought 
my truth was the "real" truth as 
does Schnaubelt. I once was 
young. 

Questions appear time and 
time again; Why Libya? Why nOt 
Syria . Iran or some other 
deserving candidate for anti-
terrorist action? And why during 
the debate on the Nicaraguan -
Contra issue? Why now? And 
the question in my mind most of 
all . why the Libyan people who 
have no control over their stand-
in psychopath / vigilante Mr. 
Kadafi? I guess we showed them 
Mr. Schnaubelt. Yes. "They 
counted wrong." Not even I 
suspected we would kill innocent 
civilians in promoting 'Justice" 
for all . But that was when I was 
short-sighted . 

I feel sad. Now we blow up 
innocent targets, innocent 
people. Innocent children. 
Innocent people do get killed 
during wa r. Schnaubelt. I gather . 
says It'S a necessary evil ; fight 
te rrori sm with terrori m. I guess 
Schnaubelt doesn't mind being 
man ipulated by an incredible 
campaign of pro paganda by an 
admi nistra ti on who has lost Sight 
of wh o they work fo r and the 
motto of our Amencan 
Constitution whic h says "Liberty 
and Ju. tice for All " I hought that 

included al! people throughout 
the world, including the libyan 
people who are completely 
innocent with respect to Kadafi 's 
terrorist campaign. I thought that 
meant justice and life for them 
as well. But that was when I was 
ignorant. 

Maybe you can live with your 
"Truth ," Mr Schnaubelt, with 
blood on your conscience; 
children's blood, aunt's and 
uncle's, mom's and dad's, sister's 
brother's. Those people are 
people like you, like me . They 
have hearts, arms, legs. They 
love, they cry, they have 
children. They are JUSt as 
innocent as the people killed in 
West Germany and elsewhere. 
Their only crime is living within 
Libyan walls; not something they 
can finanCially control. They are 
human beings! They are innocent 
human beings! They have 
birthdays! They have weddings! 
They go to school! They go to 
work! They have picnicS! They 
have family reunions! They have 
families! 

Who, Mr. Schnaubelt '" who 
are the terrorist now?

Editor: 

Affirmative action, alternative 
media, financial aid, students' 
rights ... these are some of the 
issues that POTLUCK supposedly 
rallies behind . Throughout the 
1985-86 school year . a few of the 
individuals on the present AS. 
who also hold candidate 
positions on the POTLUCK slate 
have not upheld the rights of 
students via financial aid . 
alternative media and important 
issues that concern affirmative 
action const ituencies. 

For example, when the vote 
came up to support alte rnative 

Leuers to the tdUDr should 
Ix double- or ,.-spllced 
and dddrcsSld to the 
Opinions Editor, the UCSD 
Guardian 8-016, La Jolla

number and signaturl:'. The

media . only 2-3 council members 
voted for it, none of which were 
on the POTLUCK slate. When 
the second vote came up, more 
councilmembers voted in support 
of alternative media, 1-2 of 
which were on the POTLUCK 
slate . However. it is important to 
note that the second vote 
occurred near the time of 
elections. In addition , if they 
really stood for affirmative action . 
they would inform themselves by 
attending the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee meetings and 
especially meetings held by BSU 
(Black Students Union). MEChA 
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan) . APSA (Asian Pacific 
Student Alliance). AlSC 
(American Indian Student 
Council), WRC (Women's 
Resource Center) as well as the 
Black Students Science 
Organization. Students Ac tive 
Toward Community Health . 
Chinese Students Association. 
Korean American Student 
Association and the Vietnamese 
Student Association . However, 
there has been no effort of the 
sort by POTLUCK candidates. 

So you ask why POTLUCK is 
addreSSing the aforementioned 
issues? One, by giving "lip 
service" to affirmative action. 
alternative media. etc. they're 
trying to attract the "minority" 
vote and in fact cop-opt 
concerns of students. Secondly, 
S.U.D.S. was formed to not only 
take a positive stand on various 
issues but by representing them 
they can ensure they are met. 
Third , I think that POTLUCK 
has no genuine concern for 
students' daily struggles such as 
having no money for textbooks , 
changing the book reserve policy 
to serve the majoriry of students. 
more child care for single 
mothers/ parents and improving 
tutorial services for afrirmative 
action students to retain them 
and actually see that they 
graduate. Lastly, but not 
ex hausti ve ly, il they are not "in 
touch" With concerns of the 
majority of students. then the 
only motive they have to be on 
the AS i to fatten their re sume I 

In light of my opinions , il will 
be up to you ( the students) to 
make )'our own Judgement. Will 
you want an A that increases 
parking spaces or one that gives 
them elves parking permits?

Star Wars and SDI 
By REP. ROBERT J. MRAZEK 

In the three years since the 
president announced his dream 
of making nuclear weapons 
"impotent and obsolete," the 
Stra tegiC Defense Initiative has 
become all things to all people. 

To true believers. Star Wars is 
the ultimate fantasy . in which a 
blizzard of Soviet missiles 
provides nothing more serious 
than an entertaining aerial light 
show as American families stand 
on their front lawns and cheer 
the pinball wizards of SOl to 
victory. 

To the aerospace industry and 
our cooperative allies, Star Wars 
is a jobs program. An investment 
analyst for the aerospace 
industry recently published an 
SOl newsletter entitled "Money 
from Heaven." 

To some of academia, the 
program represents a windfall in 
a time of dwindling grants and 
tight budgets. To others, such as 
Nobel physicist Sheldon L 
G1ascow of Harvard , Star Wars 
earns a '0 ' because "it is a 
danger to peace, a disinclination 
to arms control, deleterious to 
American science and it is 
destablizing, dumb and damned 
expensive." 

To the Pentagon, which has 
struggled since day one to make 
the president's dream 

correspond to some semblance 
of physical and fiscal reality, 501 

i~ rapidly becoming the largest 
major weapons system ever, with 
a $5.42 billion (not $4.8 biltion, 
as some have reported) 
requested for the program in 
fiscal year 1987 alone. 

And to Lt. Gen. James 
Abrahamson, the administration's 
polished 501 salesman, Star Wars 
is an anti-crime program. 

An anti -crime program? Well , 
Gen. Abrahamson recently told 
the Futurist magazine that a 
possible spinoff from SOl might 
involve "terrestrial illumination, 
including street lighting with 
space-based mirrors." Indeed .. .. 

But whatever SOl might be , in 
its current incarnation . it is 
certainly not the "peace shield" 
of President Reagan's 
imagination and right-wing 
advenising. Every rational 
observer of SOl's evolution agrees 
here. 

The overriding problem with 
501 as it celebrates its third 
birthday, turns out to be the 
same lack of clarity which has 
characterized the entire Reagan 
defense buildup of the past five 
years. Sure, we can spend 
mounds of money on military 
hardward. But, once developed, 
what ends do we hope to

PICK THE "CHICKEN' KIEV:' 
accomplish with it? 

The preSident first described 
SOl as a means to rid the earth 
of nuclear weapons . asking 
technology to accomplish what 
his administration showed little 
appetite for pursuing through 
diplomatic methods. But 
criticism of the plan from many 
of our most distinguished 
scientists was both immediate 
and persistent, on technical and 
strategic grounds. 

At first, critics were dismissed 
with the fatuOus reply that we 
put men on the moon and , by 
God, we can do this. But as time 
has gone along, ·the critics of SOl 
have done as much as the 
Pentagon to reshape the program 
into its current form. The 

evolution has been striking: now 
we talk of protecting silos and 
limiting damage , nor of peace 
shields. 

While the president has 
maintained the political 
advantage on this issue, the SDi 
graVy train continues to roll. Now 
the Pentagon wants a 78 percent 
funding increase for Star Wars, 
though the program itself 
continues to lurch from one 
architecture study to the next. 
Gen. Abrahamson recently 
defended the funding increase 
by telling a House anned services 
subcommittee that "the 
Manhattan and Apollo prograrns 
both eKperienced. funding growth 
in excess of (501)." 

Very well, general. But the 

Manhattan program merely 
involved the irnmediate 
geopolitical balance of power 
and the possibility of a certified 
madrnan holding the nuclear 
trump card. The Apollo program 
was. of course, peaceful, and 
bears comparison to 501 only in 
that a popular president made it 
a national goal. 

Three years later. we have 
little, if any, agreement in 
Congress about what Star Wars 
ultimately means - to us. our 
adversaries or our allies. We 
have threatened the existence of 
both the ABM Treaty and the 
Outer Space Treaty, two rnodest 
achievements of diplomacy in 
the post-war wasteland of chilly

will attempt to suppress this 
desire in the name of civilized

editorial attack I will attempt to . 
get my point across in a non-
name calling manner. 
. Stem wrote an article on 
scamming, which appeared in 
the April 28th issue of the 
Guardian . Sociology professor 

Bennett Berger, the alleged 
resident expert on scam strategy, 
backs Stem's as<:l'rtions 
co ncerning the subject. The 
claims they both make are 
nothing more than harmfully 
simplistic, stereotypical portrayals 
of what's going on when one 
student looks at another. 

Stem's pathetically cliche 
observations lead her to the 
following conclusion. When 
people look at each other, 
"they're just looking." I'm not 
sure if that statement is 
supposed to be impressive, but it

isn't. Next Stem enlightens us 
about the true meaning of the 
word "looking." "Looking" really 
means scamming, and Ms.Stem 
really wishes guys would be more 
discreet. The discussion aboUt 
guys ends before it begins, and 
Stem rotates to address the 
entire male/ female courtship 
process, more scientifically 
known as "scamming" in the 
Stem/ Berger vocabulary. One 
wonders if we have finally 
arrived at the main point of the 
piece. From "looking" to make 
indiscretion, to scamming . .. 

yes, we must be here since half 
the article is over. 

Girls have their own tactics, 
reports Stem. These include 
"short skirts, sunglasses, make-up 
or whatever we can use ." 
Professor Berger agrees ... 
"students are not able to use 
assets or social statuS to impress 
others simply because they don't 
have these things." Here is a 
UCSO prof telling us we have no 
assets except short skins and red 
lipstick. Mr. Berger, your attitude 
is a disgrace to the campus. Is it 
revolutionary to suggest that 
things such as intelligence, wit, 
humor, and sensitivity are assets? 
1 would argue that many students 
have these, and that yes, they are 
assets. 

The "three distinct stages in 
the process of scamming" that 
Stem lists , are not even worth 
reprodcuing here. 

What are real assets, Ms. Stem 
might ask. To answer that 
inquiry, 1 cenainly would not 
recommend contacting Bennett 
Berger. His opinion is 
unacceptably primitive and only 
serves to perpetuate ideas we are 
laboring to discourage. The level 
of consciousness demonstrated 
by both Stem and Berger, 
indicates to me that they are 
both in social comas.

We've seen SOl zealots hatCh 
plans to employ a new

What's new about protecting

Midgetman? Do we really intend 
to share it with the Soviets,

Recent studies have even 
suggested that space-based lasers 
(or ground-based lasers using 
orbiting mirrors) could serve an 
offensive role . R&O Associates, a

"in a matter of hours, a laser 
defense system powerful enough 
to cope with the ballistic missile 
threat can also destroy the

added to the fiscal year 1987 SOl

planners who have shown a

the arms-control community to 
curtail SOl.

an irresistable force, it might be 
wise to stop and ponder the 
implications of the program. We

Whitehead predicts '86 recession in Mexico 
By BRYAN HARRIS 

ONE HUNDRED percent inflation, hardcore unemployment and 
minus .2 percent growth plagued 
the Mexican economy in 1982. 
but between 1983 and 1984. 
Mexico was hailed as a fine 
model , showing international 
observers the best way to recover 
from a smothering foreign debt. 

In 1986, however, Mexico's 
exemplary image is deteriorating 
rapidly. Or. Laurence Whitehead 
of the Center for United States 
and Mexican Studies said , "I fear 
they (Mexicans) will not escape 

1986 without a severe recession ." 
Many factors have contributed 

to Mexico's falling economy 
including a lack of non-
traditional exportS, a waning 
agricultural system, a high 
number of imports, disappearing 
capital and an ever-increasing 
population. The primary source 
of frustration , however, is the 
fluctuating oil market. 

Since the 70s Mexico has 
worked diligently to increase 
exploitation of its petroleum 
reserves. Last year 45 percent of 
the government's revenue 

resulted from the oil industry. It 
is this dependency on the 
petroleum market that threatens 
to bury Mexico in an economic 
pit. 

' Of aU the oil-exporting 
countries, Mexico and Nigeria 
are the hardest hit by the fall in 
oil prices," Whitehead said . 

While many nations expon 
more oil than Mexico, they are 
not so adversely affected . Mexico 
is deemed a "high absorber," 
which means that a great 
percentage of their oil income 
goes to support a large 

population. Very little revenue is 
left over to cush ion Mexico 
against harmful dives in 
worldwide oil prices. Low 
absorber nations like Saudi 
Arabia are able to save much of 
their oil income as insurance 
against hard times. 

Massive petrolem reserves 
were discovered in the 1970s 
and Mexico was viewed 
internationally as "a very strong 
borrower." Nations felt secure 
lending money to Mexico 
because Its potential as a major 
oil supplier was being realized , 

Whitehead said. 
The government made some 

poor economic decision at that 
point. More and more goods 
were imponed , including a great 
deal of food . 

"From 1940-1970 Mexico was 
o ne of the more successful 
countries agriculturally ," 
Whitehead said . 

Mexico's small farms which 
had benefitted from a largescale 
irrigation project were still 
inefficient. The rise in food 
imports brought a decline in

Ruffina Juarez. of MEChA, c/alms that Cinco de Mayo IS mainly 
celebmt£d in the United States, 

Cinco de Mayo more 
of an American festival 
By EVA WONG, CO,lInbuting EdilOr 

In southern California, in grade school, you probably panicirated in Mexican food fests ,in celebration 
of Cinco de Mayo, and you were probably told that the fifth 0 May was the day of MeXICO s 
independence from Spanish rule , In addition , you were probably told that all parts of MeXICO held 
fiestas 111 honor of this day, 

The celebration of Cinco de 
Mayo In America has been 
perceived by many as a 
celebration of Mexico's 
independence day, but actually 
Cinco de Mayo is the day when 
the Mexican army. with its 
somewhat primitive weapons was 
victorious over the Fre nch army, 
with their advanced weapons, in 
a small battle at Puebla, in 1862. 
According to RufTina juarez of 

_ MEChA (Movimie nto Estudiantil 
~ Chicano de Aztilan), "In Mexico , 
.s Cinco de Mayo is not celebrated 

~ because it \vas not a big battle." 
'&: Says juarez, "Cinco de Mayo is 

celebrated in some of the border 
cities like Tijuana and Mexicali . 
which could be due to tourism, 

ProfessorJ eny Griswold 
kids around in his class 
By KEN FURIE, Feat ures Editor 

P ROFESSORjERRY Gnswold is teaching adolescent literarure, 
Lit/Gen l65 He has taught 
Ltt/ Gen 164 (affectionately 
known as "kiddie lit") at UCSD 
for the past two fall quarters, and 
the popularity of his classes is 
growi ng phenomenally, 

"I went through e~ry 
evaluation from the fall quarter 
Children's Lit. class," said 
Barbara Harron , Literarure 
Department Program 
Representative , "and the 
responses were JUSt glOWing, I've 
never seen so many great 
evaluations for one professor." 

Griswold's book choices could 
be one reason for the enormous 

popularity of hiS classes, He 
chooses real favorItes , In the 

Children '~ Lit. class, some of the 
required readings included Hans 
Christian Anderson 's Fairy Tales, 
Mark Twain's The Adventures of 
Tom 5a~er, Kenneth Graham's 
The Wind in the Willows, and an 
in depth look at Maurice 
Sendak's work, Where che Wild 
Things Are, In Lit/ Gen 165, the 
reading list includes classic 
literature like Hu ckleberry Finn 
and The Pnnce and the Pauper, by 
Mark TwaIn , Heidi , Litclf Womm, 
Tarzan of thf ApfS and Golding's 
Lord of thf Flifs, 

"What is children's literature?" 
is a question frequently asked , 
and Griswold likes to answer 

that by saying that books 
normally classified as "children's 
literature" are JUSt books that are 
usually read during childhood, 
and are favorites, but are not 
necessarily written for children. 

"What we're talki ng about is a 
body of works that children 
particularly like." Griswold said, 

Professor Gnswold, visitingfrom 
SDSU, tfac hes Lit/ Gen 165, or 
adolescent lit , thiS quarter. 

"and if you thtn k about It , they're 
really some of the mo t exci ting, 
Interesting adventure books , , 
When children look at the 
bookshelf, they don't pull down 
Henry james, and they don 't pull 
down TS ElIott , but they do pull 
down Roben Louis Stevenson , 
and they pull down Mark 
Twain ." 

Griswold choo e b oks that

border." She continues that "it is

celebration, because it is mainly 
celebrated in the United States: 

In Mexico, a Chicano is slang 
for a clumsy person, whereas to 
Mexican-Americans, a Chicano is 
a Mexican-American political 
term with a positive meaning 
that suggests racial and cultural 
pride. Says Juarez, "A Chicano is 
someone that is born here , but 
there is more than that: it refers 
to a person of Latin background 
who accepts it, and it is 
someone who knows that he or 
she can't be totally assimilated 

,g, into bei ng an American." 
<xl According to juarez, people 

~ who are aware of their 
<xl backgrounds know the 
£ differences between the 
] celebration held for Cinco de 

~ Mayo and the grander scale 
celebration for Mexico's day of 
independence held on 
September 16, Juarez co ntinues, 
'People who are LOtally 
assimilated - those that rrefer 
to be called joe instead 0 Jose 
- don't really care and don't 
really know because they re fuse 
to identify with the ir 
backgrounds," Juarez adds that 
these people will tend to believe 
what the media presents to 
them, 

Children can be greatly 
affected by the distortIOn of 
hbtory presented to them 
because they are so open to 
behevin,g what i t Id to them , 

Says Juarez, "I think that children 
that are small can easilv be 
confused , but as you get older, 
you come to realize what you 
were told wasn 't necessarily so 
true ," In a conve rsation with 
Milton, a sixth grader of Mexican 
descent from Lowell Elementary, 
he says of the significance of 
Cinco de Mayo, "It's something 
about the Mexican 
independence ," though he knew 
Mexico's independence was in 
September, 

Says Juarez, "You want the 
public to remain apolitical to a 
certain extent, so it's easier to 
trick the public into thinking 
Cinco de Mayo is JUSt a 
celebration , but it's not , there 's 
more behind it" Juarez 
co ntinues, "CinCO de Mayo is 
probably one of the most 
distorted celebrations, LO the 
point that many think it 's a 
celebration for independence. 

"The true cdebra tion for 
independence on September 16, 
is the biggest celebration held in 
Mexi co," says juarez, He add s, 
"We also try to celebrate it here , 
but it i impOSSible with the UC 
system because of the qua ncr 
sy tern and the fact that chool 
staltS late ," The celebra llon of 
independence goes on all mght 
long and is more of an eve nt 
than Cinco de Mayo , in Mexico 
and here LOO, accord ing to 
juarez,

Professor Griswold 
ontinucd from P,I.l:C 12 

classes, bur there IS one other 
li itena to answer to. 

"There arc children 's books 
that I know, and I hke, but I 
can't teach them ," Griswold said . 
"That's one of the eXC iting things 
about the field too, Really until 
Bruno Bettelheim sorr of started 

suggesting ways of interpreting 
fairy tale, I cou ldn 't teach faIry 
tales, I didn't quite know what to 
do, You read 'Hansel and Grerel' 
or you read 'Uttle Red Riding 
Hood : and then, what do you

"The picture book, now, is

the art work!. back and forth 
between words and piCtures, so 
that you bring not only literary 
critici sm to it , you've also got to 
bring art criticism to it at the

Griswold earned his degree at 
the UniverSity of Connecticut. 
How did he end up In San 
Diego? He related his story to hiS

"I came out here one time. 
during the winter," he satd, "and

Perhaps another factor 
contnbutlng to Gnswold 's 
populanty IS what a lot of the 
students mentioned 111 their 
evaluations of Gnswold, that he 
is very humorous, that he 
incorporates humor Into hiS 
lectures, Griswold admitted that 
he tries to use humor to keep 
the attention of the students, 
since the only classes he teaches 
here are one day a week, and 
three hours long.

will be so interesting you'll want 
to repeat it to your 
grandchildren." 

But Griswold takes his field 
seriously. despite his tongue-in-
cheek approach. While going 
over the class syllabus. he told 
the class generally what they 
would be doing and looking for: 
analyzing themes and motifs in 
adolescent literature; looking for 
patterns and trends; and perhaps 
discussing the sexual dichotomy 
of children's books. how some 
books are generaUy associated as 
being "girls' books" as opposed 
to "boys' books." 

"It's interesting that girls can 
read boys' books." he' said. "but 
boys will hesitate 10 read girls' 
books. though . Boys are son of 

bashful about reading lillie 
Women . So that's son of 
interesting. but there are general 
differences between the books. 
Often times girls' books tend to 
stay indoors, and boys' books 
take place outdoors. this kind of 
thing. The interest is really family 
life with girls' books. and the 
rugged individual with boys' 
books. these general types of 
themes." 

When talking about the 
popularity of the classes, one 
common suspicion can be ruled 
out , as far as Griswold is 
concerned. This is the suspicion 
that if the books are written for 
children or loved by children. 
then somehow they are easier. If 
people take Griswold's class 
because they think it will be 
easy. then they are soon 
disappointed. 

"In this class." Griswold said.

"we approach our books with the 
same SOil of intellectual stigma as 
we would adult literature . People 
have this feeling that if it's 
popular. it's worthless. But there's 
an analogy that I really like: a

One pallicularly noticeable

deals with Allison Lurie's

Tritons record a record split, 5-3, 28-10 
Playoff mess 

plagues picks 

By JOHN SCHACHT and 
GUS SANTOYO 

Y 'OU MAY NOT have heard it down here , but they sure heard it in laVerne. 
What sounded a little like Mount 
Saint Helens was in fact the 
UCSD baseball team exploding 
for a school-record 28 runs and 
27 hits in the second game of 
the season-ending double-
header. The win avenged a first 
game case of jitters when 
laVerne parlayed 12 'Judy-hits" 
into a 5-3 win . UCSD won the 
nightcap 28-10. More 
importantly, it launched the 
Tritons into a probable playolT 
date against Claremont Mudd , 
the winner of the best-of-five 
series, traveling to Marietta, Ohio 
and the College World Series. 

The 28-run outburst against 
laVerne was the combination of 
several key factors . "They've gOt a 
small ball park," said Triton 
coach Lyle Yales, "and not much 
pitching, but the number one 
incentive was, we felr, that we 
had a message to deli ver - a 
message to deliver to the coach 
of laVerne , one of the committee 
coaches for the playolT picks, a 
message to deliver to the learn 
that beat them in the opener and 
a message to themselves: "We 
can beat them ." 

"We were just really tense 
because our backs were up 
against the wall ," said the club 
leader in home runs (15) and 
RBIs (56), Bob Natal. "You could 
see it at the plaLe," said Yates, 
"We were making the strike zone 
real fat for their pitcher, and our 
pilcher (Rick Nowak) JUSI 
couldn 't find the plate." 

After the fi rst mning of the 
second game , some of the 
players asked Yates if they could 
stan talking from the rally bench . 
They had kept kind of quiet 
because they didn 't want to look 
bad in front of Owen Wright 
(laVerne's coach), but I told 
them that iT they want to talk 
now, talk aD you want. It really 
seemed to help. It was the most 
vocal I've heard the them all 
year." The Tritons responded in 
a big way, scori ng one in the 
first, six in the second , five in 
the third , two in the founh , four 
in the fifth , one in the SIXth and 
topping it 01T with nine in the 
seventh. 

"We weren 't playing bush 
league ball either," said Yates. 
"After the second inning we were 
playing it one base at a time. It's 
true that you just can't help it if 
you keep hitting it over the 
fence." It was something they did 
a lot of during the day. In the 
first game, lead·-off hitter David 
Sranovich hit a pair of solo 
shots. For an encore, he hit a 
pair in the second game, a solo 
shot and a three-run job, setting 
a new school record for dingers 
(4) in a double-header. His 
teammate Natal was impressed . 
"Dave has hit the ball well aU 
year, and he really was swinging 
well Saturday." 

He was not alone, either, as 
three other Tritons, including 
Natal, Gary Fessia and Brian 
Rude, pounded seven laVerne 
p itchers for twO home runs each. 

Brian Rude swings, he connects, he homers, he accepts congratulations. Rade hit two home runs in Ihe Tritons ' 28-10 laugher. 

Yates singled out Stanovich 
(three for four, three RBIs), D.H. 
Mitch Tuker (three for five , three 
RBis) and Jim Nicolaisen (three 
for four, on RBI) for their effons. 
On the day, only one staner did 
not record at least twO hits. 

Yates was even pleased with 
the work of staner Mark Sloan, 
who gave up seven runs (five 
earned ) in five innings. Last 
week was the first time Sloan 
had pitched in a month after 
being diagnosed as having 
mononucleosis. ' Mark is still a 
little rusty with his mechanics, 
but it was encouraging :0 see 
him out on the mound again . 
He's been here all four years , so 
we felt he deserved a shot at 
pitching in the biggest game of 
the year," said his coach, Yates. 
Dave Adomson, called "the most 
improved pitcher of the year" by 
Yates, pitched the last four 
innings to close out LaVerne. 

The Tritons were in the best 
position of the four teams 
competing for the two playoff 
spots available in the Western 
region. The Tritons' (22- 16-2) 
main competition came from 
Claremont (22-18) a team the 
Tritons split with in four games 
this year. laVerne at 23-20-l, 
had an outside shot at the 
playoffs, as did Cal State 
Stanislaus (16-17-1) with three 
games left. 

"This is the pinnacle of my 
career: said Yates, 'This is the 
best group of athletes we have 
ever had here. This is right 
where we wanted to be in our 
five-year plan." 

Natal echoed Yates' optimism: 
"This is definitely the highlight 
of my collegiate career so far." 

All of the Tntons are looking 
forward to bigger and better 
things. laVerne is just glad they 
left town . ~ 

The Pirates:. perennial harbingers 
of bad (Padre) baseball 

By JOHN SCHACHT, Sports Editor 

LAST YEAR the Padres cruised into Pittsburgh for a simple , little six-
game series, leading the NL West 
by five games in July and feeling 
pretty good about their chances 
of repeating. After losing the first 
game of that series, the Bucos 
went on to burst the Padres' 
bubble - exposing the thin 
bullpen S.D. had - and win the 
next five games to send the local 
nine on a tailspin that would 
have made A'11elia Earhan proud . 

This year the new and slightly 
improved Pirates came to tOwn 
and have once again served 
notice that all is not well in Big 
Mac land . The message in two 
Pirate wins - before Sunday's 
finale - was a simple one: ' Ring 
OUt some of the old, Bud, and 
bring in some of the new. Not 
only that, get yourself a real lead-
01T hiner and then pop off." 
Thank you, Pinsburgh . Thank 
God it's only April , this year. 

This past homestand was a 
curious one for the Pads. On 
Monday they lost a game to the 
Cubbies that they had no 
business losing, when an aging 
and rattled Goose gave up a twO-
run double to heavy-hitting 
Bobby Dernier after the Rubbles 
had made five errors during the 
course of the game, in a galla,lt 
attempt to give San Diego the 
ball game. Another highlight was 
the performance of the Garv, 
whose love of the low and 
outside slider is suc h thaI he has 
no intention of ever hitting it 
with the bat. 

Tuesday, the Padres won a 
game they had no business 
winning. After eight over-
powering innings from Rick 
Sutcliffe, Terry Kennedy took a 
Ray Fontenot slider deep for a 
three·run "big-fly" that gave the 
Padres a 4-3 win in the ninth . 

Luckily for San Diego, the 
team that currently most 
resembles a dead fish - the 
Cardinals - came into town for 
a quick two losses before the 
Bucos came in over the 
weekend . The Padres WJ~ two 
gutsy staning performances from 
Thurmond and Show, but it was 
the Cardinals' impressive team 
average of .210 that got all of us 
excited . 

Friday night, the Pirates got a . 
shut out from some dude named 
Bielecki and two relievers, and 
Saturday, the Goose convened a 
5·3 lead in the eighth into a 7·6 
loss in the nimh. "Yes," the 
Goose assured us last Monday, 
"I'm not tired'" Just aging. 

The Buc series and the 
home stand in general exposed 
some of the weaknesses that will 

plague the Padres the rest <>f the 
year unless Trader Jack can 
engineer a trade. (No, Rick 
Rhoden is an incorrect answer.) 
As the Pirates usher the Pads out 
on their upcoming lO-game road 
trip, ponder these thoughts, 
Padre management. Your first-
baseman and clean-up hitter is 
hitting a tOrrid .220, speciaiizes 
in the Special "K" and 
meaningless solo shots. and 
clutch-hits about as often as the 
Cubs and Padres get together for 
the National League Pennant. 
Your left-fielder is a talented 
hitter stuck in a position where 
the only problem he has is with 
"fly baDs." You have no lead-off 
hiner, which, one would 
speculate, is not good for the 
running game that manager Steve 
Boros spent all spring perfecting, 
and the Padres have spent all 
season undoing. 

But until the loggetjam at first 
breaks and the Padres can put a 
true lead-off hitter in left , things 
will undoubtedly remain the 
same. At least until the Bucos 
come to town again . ~

The five distinct missions, 
each including camera-equipped 
instruments aboard the space 
crafts, were the Vega 1 and 2 
from the Soviet Union , the 
Giollo instrument from France 
(and eight other European 
nations) and the Suisei (comet) 
and Sakagake (explorer) from 

Japan , although Mendis was not 
associated with the Japanese 
mission. 

AU missions were pan of the 
Imer-Agency Consulting Group, 
where Mendis played mostly an 
interpretive role. Despite rumors 
that Mendis was the only 
American invited to collaborate 
in the mission, Mendis stated 
that about five Americans were 
involved with the Soviet mission 
and many more were involved 
with the European mission.

The space missions were a 
collaborated effort, 
·complimentary, rather than 
co mpetitive," Mendis said . Each 
of the five space crafts flew by 
the comet at dilTerent times and 
speeds. The infonnation 
collected on the space craft was 
transferred to the investigators 
within four hours. 

At th e Space Reserach Institute 
in Moscow, the Soviet mi ssion 
reported encounters of Halley'S 
co met on Marc h 6 and 9. Their 
three-channel spectrometer, a 
joint elTon of the Soviet Union, 
France and Bulgaria , was used to 
view cometry molecules. 

In Darnstadt, Germany, Mendis 
then spent four days at the 
European Space Operations 
Center (ESOC), where he worked 
on the plasma, electrons and 
cometry ions detected by the 
GiOllO. -

The 13th histroical recording 
of Halley's cornet (the first made 
by the Chinese), dispelled 
existing scientific beliefs of the 
comet's composition. "The early 
concpetion of Halley's comet was 
that it was a dirty snowball, but 
we are seeing an outer crust 
which hides the snow," Mendis

said. 

Mendis, origina lly f;om Sri 
Lanka, was part of the five-year 
planning process conducted by 
[he National Academy of Science 
(NAS) in the Soviet Union, 

Mexican economy 
which awaited the return of 

. Halley's comet. Mendis' 
knowledge and background were 
valuable to the mission and 
motivated the NAS to confer with 
him about the "baseline model of 
the mission ," Mendis said . 

According to a repon co· 
written by Mendis titled, "The 
Spacecraft Encounters of Comet 
Halley," the United States, which 
did not send a spacecraft to 
Halley, did help calculate 
spacecraft trajectoreis, assess 
potential dust damage and track 
the spacecraft with NASA's Deep 
Space Network. 

"The totality of th e five 
missions constitute an 
o utstanding scientific success 
with the findings of each 
complimenting those of 
international scientific 
collaboration, with scientists 
from many nations taking pan in 
each of the missions," Mendis

domestic agriculture that many 
would soon regret. 

Inflation rose steadily after the 
oil boom causing the value of the 
peso to drop rapidly in 
comparison to the U.S. dollar. In 
anticipation of funher 
devaluations, people began 
sending money out of Mexico to 
invest in the United States, 
whose currency was more stable . 
This "money flight" occurred 
both legally and criminally, but 
the overall effect was crippling. 
Whitehead estimates that "about 
50 percent of the money loaned 
to Mexico leaked out of the 
COUntry.' 

Thi s unpatriotic financial 
injury contributes to the lack of 
credibility that is being 
associated with President de la 
Madrid's government. The 
Camarena narcotics ca.se which 
uncovered widespread police 
corruption, and the government's 
poor response to the recent

Whitehead sees a bleak future 
for Mexico if it continues on its 
present course , which many 
other e xperts feel will not change

projections that should be

technology developing in 
California is being considered

Education is also one of Mexico's 
highest priorities, second only to 
the interest payments on foreign
