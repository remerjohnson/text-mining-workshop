Inferhall Council 
Consiaers Cafeteria 

The Interhall council met in 
emergency session two weeks ago 
Tuesday night to consider the sta-
tus of the Revelle cafeteria. 

That afternoon a group of stu-
dents had attempted to enter the 
cafeteria after a rally protesting 
the "closing" of that facillty. At 
present only resident students or 
those purchasing a complete meal 
are allowed to eat there. 

with an open facility. 
However, they also considered 

the inevitability of cheating occur-
ring, for which the resident stu-
dents and the university must foot 
the bill. Last year there were 
numerous incidents of resident 
students feeding commuters, and 
of commuters helping themselves

dents' contract states the Prophet 
Company may assess the students

YR' 5 Go for Flagpole 
A flagpole to fly the American 

flag in Revelle College Plaza w1ll 
be bunt during Christmas vaca-
tion, Charles Booth, president of 
Young Republicans of UCSD, an-
nounced last week. 

The project, which has been 
deemed a "university project" by 
Chancellor Galbraith, was initiated 
by YR's one and a half weeks ago 
as a reaction to the celebration of 
the Bolshevik Revolution of 7 No-
vember, staged by the students -<>f 
the Independent Left. 

"We have already obtained 500 
signatures on our petition," Booth 
said, "and almost $100 in contri-
butions from UCSD students, facul-
ty and staff." 

According to Dean Murphy, many 
people outside the university com-
munity have offered to donate 
money and flags. 

"This flagpole and flag," the 
dean said in a television interview 
last week, "will serve as a per-
manent reminder that it is under 
the flag that would fly from that 
pole that free speech is indeed 
possible. " 

The flagpole will be placed in 
the grassy plot in the northeast 
corner of Revelle Plaza, and wlll 
be made out of pre-stressed con-
crete, according to Booth, who is 
seeking a contractor to build the 

Representatives from the council 
were sent to speak to Barry Sha-
piro, a leader in the open cafe-
teria campaign, and to present 
their views at the rally the next 
day. 

It was decided that until some 
plan could be divised that would 
satisfy everyone it wa. necessary 
to protect the rights of the resi-
dent students. The Deans stated 
that they would continue taking the 
names of infractors, and received 
the endorsement of the council.

pole at cost or below. 
"Our primary concern," he 

said, "is that the students and 
everyone else on campus is in 
favor of this project. We didn't 
need petitions, but it was the only 
way we could sample campus opin-
ion. It doesn't have to be said that 
the response has been overwhelm-
ing." 

(All day Friday UCSD was called 
by people from all over Southern 
California who wanted to know why 
there were no flags at UCSD. 
McKinney apparently did not know 
that US flags fly in Matthews, 
Scripps and the Revelle Post Of-
fice.) 

Offers of flags came from 
widows, congressmen, YMCA's, 
and other organizations. Rep. Bob 
Wilson and Lionel Van Deerlin, 
Republican and Democrat con-
gressmen from San Diego, jointly 
promised a flag that has flown over 
the Capitol in Washington. 

According to Booth, Young Re-
publicans raise money for flag-
poles as each success ive college 
is built at UCSD. 

"When the University Center is 
completed," he suggested, "we 
may sponsor a drive to have flag-
poles erected to fly the flags of 
every nation repre ented by for-
eign students on campus." 

Ron Karenga, at podium, speaks to the UCSD community on his conception of tilt future 
of the black peoples in America. Karenga is reputed to be the most progressive black 

nationalist in the country. His appearance on November 14 in the Revelle Cafeteria was 
sponsored by the Black students CooDcll, Guest-in- Residence program and the A.S.

"Thanksgiving." the student 
said to me disgustedly. "What's 
there to be thankful for?" 

Much. But at the day's end 
one's spirIts can sag. The trag-
edy of \'iet Nam lurches on, 
baffling all but the simple and 
self-righteous with its ironies and 
involutions. Humorless men, with 
no understanding of a university 
and no respect for the moral 
commitments of its younger mem-
bers, seek to establish political 
bases for the mselves by de:nanding 
that we foreswear the values and 
precepts without which no univer-
sity can maintain its nature or 
its being. Fretted by the time 
it has taken to work out a sensible 
policy tor the cafeterias, some 
have deliberately put themselves 
above the rules, though only under 
rules -- which we can change, 
albeit slowly -- can we stand 
against those on the outside who 
would have us flout them and deny 
the rights of our students. All 
of us worry lest diminished support 
impair the excellence USCD has 
attained with such astonishing 
swiftness. And many -- par-
ticularly the newcomers -- are 
disappointed that even that excel-
lence see ms to fall short of what 
they hoped for. 

Still, there is much. On the 
national" scene no demagogue has 
come forward to concentrate the 
rears and furies or an anxious 
people. The white backlash is so 
much less than was expected that 
no real candidate for high office 
outside the South is likely to try 
to manipulate it for gain. Critics 
of the government's policies speak 
in louder chorus than ever with 
no expectation that they will be 
silenced. Considering the coun-
try's mood we are doing well 
at respecting another' s right to 
speak his mind, however we may 
detest his views. 

At UCSD the new academic year 
has brought much to be thankful 
for. The Chancellor has rea!-
tirmed with clarity, dignity. and 
force his determination to uphold 
liberty under law. Challenged by 
men of passionate convictions on 
matters of the most profound con-
cern, Dean Murphy has responded 
with his own affirmation of liberty 
in words that show an exceptional 
integrity and eloquence. Even 
those who disagree with him can 
only hold the man himself in higher 
regard. Revelle College has found 
in Paul Saltman a superb and 
resourceful leader whose sense of 
humor cuts through all cant. A 
plan for Third College, utterly 
different from the fir st two and 
challenging the imagination with 
its fresh approach to undergrad-
uate education, is taking shape 
under the ebullient direction of 
Armin Rappaport. John Muir 
college has made a good beginning 
with only a few stumbles. And 
after looking us over for several 
days. an accreditatlon team made 
up of high-ranking officers of sis-
ter institutions praised the dyna-
mism, the creativity, and the en-
thusiasm of this campus. To them, 
anyway, we seemed more hopeful 
than harrassed. 

One could cite many things, but 
these suffice. Without forgetting 
the violence and brutality around 
and amidst us, we can be thankful 
that those institutions, such as 
our universities, which in the slow 
crawl of history men have devised 
against violence and brutality, are 
holding firm, and will as long as 
we ourselves to not pull away 
the piers in the name of some 
transcentant, monochromatic vi-
sion that justifies all -- that those 
institutions are strong and have 
their strong defenders. Let us 
speak out for and with them.

MUIR FRESHMA 

From East Berlin: Duty Over All 
Editor, he Triton Times 

It was my good fortune this last 
year to study in West Berlin and 
through frequent visits to East 
Berlin was able to make friends 
in the eastern part of the city. 
One of my East Berlin friends, 
a medical student, does not want 
to flee to the West. The follow-
ing is his response to my ques-
tion of why he does not want to 
leave East Ge rmany. 

"Newton said that people build 
too many walls and not enough 
bridges. If this is true, then 
we need people who are ready 
for other people or who are there 
(Dasein) for others. How would 
it be if everyone wanted to get 
to the other side and abandon 
the others? 

It's easier to worry about 1000 
people than to be there for just 
one person. We are not helped 
by people who pity us, It only 
helps when one person is there 
(or another. I know (rom my 
friends in the West that they are 
not able to withdraw themselves 
from the standards of society to 
realize what reality actually 
means. They pity us, but I think 
we can pity ourselves well enough 
without their help. Freedom is 
not a gift added to what we already 
have, but rather is a job at which 
we work. It is a responsibility. 
I want to be here (or my neighbor 
in order to be useful in this my 
job, and in this way to be (ree 
and carry responsibility. And 
[ want to be where I am, for 
the people, and not where l wou Id 
like to be because certain things 
there (in the West) happen to 
please me more. 

'Wenn man das Dasein als eine 
Aufgabe betrachtet. dano vermag 
man es immer zu ertragen' 
(Eschenbach). (If you view your 
presence in a given circumstance 
as your duty or job or work, 
then you \'OJ.! I find the strength 
to carry through that presence.) 
This is 3 powerful sentence. Ou r 
job is exactly that which lets 
us come to the help of our neigh-
bor. One could say: If I con-
sider my being in East Ge rmany 

as my job, Le. to stay and help 
the people here, then I will always 
find the strength to carry that 
job ou t. 

I do not want to live in the West, 
for East Ge rmany is my home, 
my duties are here. Jim, I hope 
this lette r has made my stand 
clearer to you. Please realize 
how much you r visits have meant 
to me."--Winfried .

College students considering ca-

reers as research scientists are 
invited to become better acquainted 
with the challenge ot research in 
the many disciplines which are In-
volved in oral biology or dental 
research. 

The American Dental Associa-
tion and the American Association 
of Dental Schools sponsor a pro-
gram wbich provides the oppor-
tunity for pre-baccalaureate col-
lege students to spend a period ot 
at least ten weeks during the sum-
mer in the laboratories ot dental 
scientists throughout the United 
States. Research experience and 
an orientation to dental research 
are offered in such fields as anat-
omy, anthropology, the behavioral 
and social sciences, biochemistry, 
cancer research, crystallography, 
electron microscopy, embryology, 
genetics, metallurgy, microbiol-
ogy, pathology, pharmacology, 
physiology, polymer chemistry, 
radlation biology, and others. 

The program has tour objec-
tives: to select promising college 
science students for participation 
in dental research; to acquaint se-
lected students with the challeng-
ing scientific problems in oral 
health research; to supplement 
the education and training of se-
lected students in the environment 
of dental research laboratories at 
recognized educational and re-
search institutions; and to pro-
vide an appreciation of the prob-
lems in dental research for those 
students who eventually choose 
other areas of science for a ca-
reer. 

Adhering to the philosophy that 
education and training in scien-
tific research should be "custom-
tailored" to the needs, interests 
and competence of each individual 
as nearly as possible, no fixed 
research program is required. 
Emphasis is placed on providing 
experience in scientUic investiga-
tion and orientation toward dental 
research. Seminars or lectures 
of interest may be attended, but 
the student may not take formal 
courses for college credit. 

Selected pre-baccalaureate col-
lege students are placed in the 
laboratories of prominent dental 
scientists for a period of at least 
ten weeks during the summer. 
These students may have specific 
research projects which they wish 
to explore, or they may assist in 
current projects which are being 
conducted in the laboratory of 'the 
host scientist. Upon completion of 
the program, each research par-
ticipant is invited to a conference 
at which informal reports on the 
summer activities are presented 
and discussed. Each participant 
is asked to provide the re earch 
program director with a resume 
of his activities for the summer at 
that time. To acquaint those .stu-
dents selected with the depth and 
breadth of dental research each 
participant will also receive a sub-
scription to the "Journal otDental 
Research" or to the "Archives of 
Oral Biology". 

Thirty students w1ll be selected 
for the 1968 program and fifteen 
students will be designated as al-
ternates. The selection will be 
made by a committee ot scientists 
and educators on the basis of scho-
lastic ability, lnterest in a scien-
tific career, scientif1c aptitude, 
and demonstrated initiative and 
leadership. Interested -students 
should submit a completed applica-
tion form and college transcripts 
to the Council of Dental Research 
o! the American Dental Associa-
tion by February 15, 1968. 

If a selected student has a spe-
cil1c research interest or research 
problem he would lUte to pursue,

every attempt will be made to place 
him in a laboratory in which that 
type of research is currently being 
conducted. More broadly, if the 
student indicates an interest in a 
general field of research such as 
anatomy or biochemistr~, he will 
be placed in a laboratory in this 
field without regard to the specifiC 
type of research being conducted. 

The student may be placed in a 

research facility anywhere in the 
United States. If there are reasons 
why the student must be located in 
a particular geographic area, these 
reasons must be stated in the ap-
plication. 

Each research participant will 
receive a stipend of $700 tor the 
period of his participation. In ad-
dition he will receive expenses for 
transportation as necessary from

sponsible for developing a stimu-

Muir Sets Up Claymore 
Recently what appears to be a 

new word has been drUting in 
occasionally during Muir campus 
conversations. 

However, a little research shows 
that 'Claymore' is really not such 
a new word after all, but just a 
novelty to this campus. Its origins 
can be traced back to the ancient 
Scots (who are as everyone knows 
part of the great Muir heritage). 
To the m it s ignified a type of 
sword. 

But in what way does this re-
juvenated word pertain to Muir? 
A little more research uncovered 
a new society being formed at 
Muir, a society whose name is 
derived from the traditional Scot-
Ish sword-- The Anonymous So-
ciety of the Claymore. 

At the first Muir College Pro-
visional Council meeting a com-
mittee was formed to establish 
the Anonymous Societyof the Clay-
more. They were charged to "form 
a society of live anonymous mem-
bers." These members would con-
sist of "two men, two women, and 
one of the following: Provost, Busi-
ness Manager, College Dean, Resi-
dent Dean, Resident Follow, Resi-
dent Advisor, Faculty ," All those 
finally chosen would 1>e sworn to 
secrecy about their nembership 
to the Claymore . Afh'r the initial 
choice of five membe s the Clay-
more would become a "private, 
self-perpetuating grO'lP of fiv~" 
that are supposedly free of all 
hinderances in the fO! m of faculty 
or administration. 

The Society of th3 Claymore 
presents a strange pl(ture bydes-
crlbing itself with su:h words as: 
"anonymous, private, self-per-
petuating". Muir s tudents have be-
gun to wonder just what the exact 
purpose of the Claymore is, for so 
far this purpose has only been hint-
ed at in vague phrases. It is main-
tained that the society wUl not be 
a "watchdog" neither wUl it "en-
fringe on individual rights." It has 
also been stated that the Ciay-
more' s principal objective w11l be 
" to expose farces, organizations 

detrimental to the college, bin-
Jrances and even administrative 
weaknesses." However, how far 
their power will reach and in what 
ways it wlll manUest itself has 

not yet been established. 

The Muir College Community is 
awaiting the first demonstrations 
of the Claymore's power and/or 
usefulne ss.

Q-Hut Land Plots B-B-Q 
An interesting situation is oc-

curring currently atthe beauteous, 
temporary tacilltles of Muir Col-
lege at Matthews Campus. In the 
gentle surroundings of trees, rab-

I 
bits, quonset huts, and a one-to-
one boy-girl ratio, the students 
of Jolm Muir's namesake college 
have undertaken to geaerale a 
working student government. 

The representatives of the Muir 
College government, having hearts 

of gold (and minds to match), have 
undertaken to produceaChristmas 
supper - bar - b - que and festival. 
The students of Quonset Hut Land 
will take turns watching a side 
of beet beIng bar-b-~ed on an 
open tire all night. An addition 
al brigade of mean old Murians 
has been commissioned to keep 
the Innocent Revelle students at 
a distance. Pity the poor stu-
dents of Revelle! 

Student Government 

Offers Involvement 
In many colleges in the United 

states there is a traditional lack 
of student participation and in-
volvement in the important de-
cision-making processes of the 
college. Muir College student gov-
ernment will change this pattern. 
n will offer the student a chance 
to become involved responsibly 
and to use his classroom educa-
tion in a definite way participating 
in activities in the college com-
munity and in lUe. It will in-
sure the student of a positive 
means of expressing opinions and 
concerns about the future of the 
college . in this way the college 
will renect the spirit and the as-
pirations of the enUre college com-
munity. 

With these ideas in mind the 
Muir College students and admin-
istration have begun to buUd a 
student government. The first step 
in this structure is the "Pro-
visional Muir College Govern-
ment." 

The Provisional Government 
consists of two representatives 
elected by each dorm, commutor 
representatives, and administra-
tive advisors. 'l'he representatives 
are as follows: Kenneth Patric and 
Robert Constance, Behring Hall; 
Laura Stokes and Janice Thomp-
son, Cabr1ll0 Hall; Lynne Yar-
borough and Sue Milton, Dana 
Hall; Barry Reder and Philip De-
mosthenes, DeAnza Hall; J eanne 
Schraud and Susan Halfon, Drake

The Provisional Government has 

already begun planning and organ-
izing. Eight committees have been 
formed thus far. These commit-
tees are concerned with a variety 
of things such as: representation 
in the U.S. Senate; a Muir College 
Committee On Student Affairs; the 
planning and the uses of the future 
Muir Student Center; the financ-
ing of the Muir Student Govern-
ment; a permanent constitution; 
and Residence Halls Affairs. These 
committees offer other students , 
besides the representatives, a 
chance to become actively involved 
in the Muir College Community 
We. 

Another way to voice opinions 
on the comming issues offered 
to the students is the Muir Col-
lege General Meetings. At these 
meetings the different committees 
report on their progress. Their 
progress and goals are topics for 
a group discussion in which every-
one can participate. 

The First Muir College General 
Meeting was held October 24. Com-
mittee reports were given and a 
lively discussion on the formation 
of a permanent government fol-
lowed. 

Matthews Campus Gets 
New Student Center 

By Spring quarter Muir students 
may have their own student center 
at Matthews campus. Originall} 
intended for completion this Fall, 
the facility has been delayed by 
architectural decis ions and mount-
ing expense. The Center will cost 
an estimated $60,000, and should 
be completed this spring. 

The two story building wUl 
house a photographer's dark r oom, 
a carpeted study lounge , a pri-
vate TV lounge, and several game 
decks. The game room will con-
tain ping-pong and bUllard tables. 
There wlll be a storage area tor 
students' use and a resident man-
ager. The oUlces of radio station 
KSDT will also be located in the 
bIIllding. 

An exclusive vending machine 
complex rather than a snack bar 
will cater to the hungry student. 

An uncommitted, large meeting 
room will also be available for 
use by all student organizations. 

The Center wlll be useful to 
commuters and residents outside 
for a "commuter bridge" stretch-
es from the Matthews student 
parking lot through the second 
noor of the building. 

Dean Murphy also hopes to pro-
vide lockers and bicycles for com-
muter use. This student center 
will be the nucleus of a cluster 
of similar facilities which will 
eventually comprise the Matthews 
Student Union.

A&E T ells of Proiects 
In an exclusive Interview Bob 

Messmer in the department of 
Architects and Engineers told the 
"Triton Times" last week that 
the Matthews Surge Lab, Student 
Center, Provost ' s Office and other 
projects were under way. 

The Surge Lab, said Messmer, 
will provide Muir and the following 
UCSD colleges with temporary lab 
facilities, since Revelle's labora-
torie s are being pressed for space 
at the present. 

The building is under construc-
tion on the old site of the amphi-
theatre in Matthews Campus, a-
cross from Building 250 (Student 
Affairs Office). 

"The top floor will provide the 
faculty with six research labs, 
Messmer said. "The undergrads 
will use the two teaching labs on 
the gr ound n oor, and the rest of 
the building will be made up of of-
fices, service faCilities, and ad-
ministrative space ." 

"While the Basic Sciences 
BuH1ing in the Medical School 
will cost about $45 per square 
foot, the Surge Lab is only $13 .30 
a square foot. This savings is 
naturally timely in this economy 
year ." 

The buUding is expected to last 
at least 25 year s, Messmer ex-
plained, but ''It may be obsolete 
long before it wears out. In 25 
years students might be learning 
lab techniques far from a labora-
tory. " 

Turning to the just-completed 
Provost's Office in Matthews, 
Messmer said that this building 
across from the cafeteria wlll be-
come the temporary headquarters 
for each provos t as each college 
.moves to the Matthews s taging 

area. 

"After Provost Stewart moves 
to his Muir headauarters in two 
years, Armin Rappaport (Provost 
of Third College) WIlt move into 
Stewart's offices. The rest of the 
building will soon become faculty 
offices." 

The Matthews Student Center, on 
the other hand, will remain, along 
with the Provost's office and dorms 
until Twelfth College is built about 
1995. 

"The Center," Messmer said, 
"will provide Matthews students 
with a type of student union--pool 
hall, study rooms, etc. The radio 
station (KSDT) will occupy the en-
tire top Cloor when it is com-
pleted about mid-March, 1968." 

This building will be located 
across the canyon between the 
Matthews dorm s and student park-
Ing lot. 

Soon, according to A & E, a 
road will be built from Gllman 
Drive into the Matthews area to 
accomodate the Medical School 
and staging area colleges. 

"The PE Department moves out 
at the end of the academic year, 
the Student Affairs Office is de-
molished in two years, and this 
road wlll become the main thor-
oughfare," says campus architect 
Bob Kason. 

"The red strips of material on 
the eucalyptus trees mark the 
road's position," Kason explained, 
, 'And since it will go right past 
A & E, we felt some kind of 
decoration was in order." 

That explains the strange piece 
of sculpture in front otthe building. 

"We took the fiberglass that we 
have been using for the capltals 
on the Cluster I gymnasium and 

Student, center, graces southwest corner of Muir' s res idence area. 
--Staff photo 

placed it in front of our building. 
The contractor has agreed to pour 
the concrete for nothing, and soon 
Matthews will have its first out-
side sculpture." 

Kason hopes UCSD can obtain 
more aesthetic beauty by using 
such unordinary objects. 

Such use of discarded materials 
has been used to decorate the gar-
den behind the A & E building. 

"We have used the handball 
courts for flower boxes and a con-
crete wall," he said. "Claus von 
Wendel, a German architect, has 
used discarded plumbing outside, 
and we have painted iron forms 
orange and arranged them in a 
row until we are ready to bulld 
more offices." 

C.O.S.A . 
The relationship between the stu-

dent and the faculty and adminis-
tration is an all important one. Ef-
fective, clear communications be-
tween these levels can alleviate 
many of the problems that plague 
the college community. The Muir 
College Committee on Student Af-
fairs (M.C.C .D.S.A.) has been 
formed so that this type of commu-
nication can become a reality. 

The M.C.C.D.S.A. will discuss all 
facets of college life that affect the 
well-being of the students. To quote 
a memo from the Provost's Office, 
this includes: "instruction, advis-
ing, studying, recreation, conduct, 
morale, rights , facilities, re la-
tions with the community, the 'feel 
of life in the college ' .... In short, 
this committee is the guardian of 
character and excellence of John 
Muir College." 

The M.C.C.O.S.A. consists of 
representatives from the college 
administration, faculty members, 
and students . The students on this 
committee were chosen by the Pro-
visional Gove rnment. Theyapplied 
for these positions and were inter-
viewed before being nominated. 
The administratlon is anon-voting 
part of the committee. The facul-
ty members of this committee and 
the students each have a vote. How-
ever, the students hold the major-
ity of the votes. 

The policy of the UCSD college 
system is to let each college be-
come a somewhat private com-
munityand manage its own affairs. 
In many ways the Indlvidualls held 
more responsible for himself than 
in other institutes of learning.

New A S Problems 
Stem from Colleges 

The relationship between the 
AS and Muir College has become 
a matter of money. ' 

"What we most need," says 
BUl Stlles, Muir's AS Senator, "is 
money for dances and other col-
lege-oriented activities. Right now 
the Senate has control ot all the 
money students pay each quarter. 
What should be done is each col-
lege should receive a percentage 
of those funds for its own individual 
needs." 

This year the AS has had to deal 
with the actual existence of col-
leges at UCSD. For three years, of 
course, the AS was essentially 
Revelle College. AU activities 
were Revelle-oriented. Everything 
took place in the first college's 
cafeteria, lecture hall s, or free 
speech areas. 

With the appearance of J ohn 
Muir, however, the Senate has 
come face to tace with the proble m 
no one knows how to solve: how to 
separate college activities from 
AS functions and still preserve the 
overall unity of the univer s ity. 

Fortunately Muirians have re-
sponded with typical UCSD initia-
tive. Jus t as Revellians organized 
the AS during the summer of 1964 
before the college opened, students 
at the second college have worked 
hard in getting their government 
off the ground. The ir provis iona l 
council i s setting policy and guide-
lines for the gove rnment which 
will be formalized before the 
Spring quarter. All this has been 
accomplis bed without AS leader-
ship. 

This neglect, unfortunately, has 
led to a false impr ession amongst 
Muir s tudents of the role of the 
AS Senate. "They' r e just Reve lle," 
one hears trom eve r y dorm. We 
havp fo forge it alone ." 

stiles puts it this way: " The AS 
really has to be more receptive to 
each college's needs . or course, 
I'm the only senator from Muir, 
and that's only because I trans -
ferred there this year." 

According to the ASConst itution 
ot 1966, Muir and Revelle each 
will have three senators elected at 
large in the Winte r quarter's e lec-
tions . 

But the Senate has tried to patch 
up the s ituation by recognizing two 
ex officio members from Muir 
until that election. Bob Constanzt 
and Warren Benjamin can aid St iles 
in presenting the AS with Muir' s 
proble ms. 

Bes ides this friendly move , the 
Senate has also appropriated $50 
to Muir's unique Commuter As-
sociation. 

Still, Stiles says , the Senate has 
not solved the question of AS- Col-
lege relationships. To what extent 
Is the Senate r esponsible fo r col-
lege functions? How should college 
activities be funded? Should clubs 
be campus or college wide? 

stiles believes that the consti-
tution will have to be revised in 
the end. 

"The AS should definitely keep 
its hands on the pur se strings," he 
says, " bu t colleges should be 
guar anteed of some revenue each 
quarte r ." 

The var ious groups on campus 
should have real representation, he 
says. 

"Per haps the commuters can 
have their own Senator. They, after 
all, compr ise the largest segment 
of UCSD 's student population. 

"There just has to be a greater 
voice from the colleges in the 
Senate ," Stiles concludes. It All 
we want to know is who should'be 
what for whom."

Biola Invites;

~, DAVE STE.IMS 
Biola College, our basketball op-

ponents last night, were hosts last 
week for the eighth annual Biola 
Cross Country Invitational at La 
Mirada. 

There were 18 schools represent 
ed at the meet, including most of 
the smaller colleges in Southern 
California. UCSD fini shed 13th with 
347 points; Westmont, the fir st 
place finisher in 1965, repeated 
its performance by narrowly out-
pointing last year's champion Red-
lands. 

utes from his usual times for the 
mile, Z mile, and such. 

Warren Kum lev continues to im-
prove over a mediocre start early 
in the season, and Wilson was much 
pleased over his and Gillette's 
continued progress. 

"All in all," said Wilson, "our 
fini sh shows the good conditioning 
that the tea m has. " 

The schools in the Invitational 
included Westmont, Biola, Red-
lands, Fullerton, UC Riverside, 
Whittier, Pomona, Azusa PacifiC, 
Pasadena, Cal Poly, Cal Western, 
Cal Tech, UCSD, Southern Cal 
La Verne , Chapman, Cal Baptist, 
and Cal Lutheran. Most of these 

Peckham was the fir st man for 
the Tritons , completing the 4.25 
mile course in 25.48, good for 
45th in the field. Gillette was se-
cond in the time 27:04, withKumley 
a half minute back at 27:32. Lind-
sey and Farrar brought it in for 
the team in 27: 39 and 29: 06 r e-
sptctively.

Just seconds off the course record 
of 22:13. 

With conditions quite hot, and 
with a sight smog that irritated 
the many chest COlds, Coach Bob

well as could be expected. First 
man Bob Segal was out with the

in his overall loss of two min-

Water Polo Ends 

The UCSD water polo team clos-
ed out its 1967 season with an 
imprOving, if not winning effort. 
Coach Mike Gerry praised his 
team, the majority of which is 
freshmen and have not played in 
the organized sport before. 

In their last two meets against 
Irvine on Nov. 3 and San Diego 
State on the 4th, the Tritons showed 
marked improvement over their 
first meetings with those two 
schools. The Friday game against 
UC Irvine ended up Irvine 9, UCSD 
3 , but when one considers that 
the previous ti me saw Irvine beat 
the locals 15 to I, praise can be 
given. 

San Diego State, a perennial 
aquatics power, thumped the Tri-
tons 10- 5 in the first meet of 
the season, but had to fight to win 
their second meeting from a de-
termined UCSD squad 8-6. 

Gerry lauded Goalie Jerry Kude-
son for his fine work throughout 
the season. He also felt that Andy 
Eliot and Byron King, the top 
scorers for the Tritons, dese rved 
merit for their effort. Rob Ken-
nelly was cited for defensive work.

Swimmers Prepare " 
for Opening 

Coach Mike Gerry oC the UCSD 
swimming team expressed cau-
tious optimism last week about the 
up-coming first season. With 20 
swimmers out so far, and the 
first meet Dec . 2 against UC 
Santa Barbara, Gerry hopes that 
all students who are interested 
will join the squad. 

Practices as well as all home 
meets are he ld in the newly com-
pleted natatorium. Gerry said that 
the team is tentatively scheduled 
for 8 or 9 meets over the season, 

averagmg one a week through A:' 
pri!. There will be approximate ly 
four home meets. 

Coach Gerry claimed that he 
has no idea at all what kind of 

Season 
talent he has , except those men 
of his water polo team, which 
flas just recently finished its first 
season with a 0-6 mark. 

"There ar e two r eal tough duel 
meets this year," Gerry said, 
"with schools out of ou r class . 
Those are UC Irvine, NCAA col-
lege division champs, and San 
Diego State." State, Gerry' s al-
ma mater, was NCAA runner-up. 
The team is nearly all freshmen , 
so youth is abundant. 

The hope has been raised that 
UCSD will be able to partiCipate 
in a tri- meet with the Univer-
sity of San Diego, and Cal Western, 
both of which are also just start-
ing their swimming programs.

Women's Flag Football is about 
to wind up its season with just 
three games left to make up. So 
far, Janet Albin's "Letcher Lltch's 
LUlies" have dominated the league 
with 6 wins and 0 losses, all six 
of which were shutouts. 

Bob Litchfield has done a tre-
mendous job of keeping the girls 
going with an Albin k> Kohler

Judo Club 
PrepstoMeet 
Competition 

The Judo Club is currently work-
ing out during two scheduled work-
outs, Tuesday 8:30 A.M. - 11:00 
A.M. and Wednesday evenings 7: 30 
P.M. - 9:00 P.M. in N269 Gym. We 
find approximately 10 Judoka going 
through a series of grunts and fall s 
which shake the entire wrestling 
loom. Coach Gary R. Schiller (San 
Kyu) said he Is well pleased with 
the talent exhibited by the graded 
(experienced) Judoka and feels that 
the Club will be able to instruct 
beginners in the near future. Also, 
after an 8 week period of intensive 
training, the U.C.S.D. Judo Club 
will be ready to play against other 
competitive clubs in the San Diego 
area. 

When asked to explain a bit about 
Judo, Sch1ller had this to say: 
"Judo means literally 'the gentle 
way.' Its purpose is to disarm or 
disable your opponent and not to 
injure or marne. Judo (Jiu-Jitsu) 
has been practiced by royal fami-
lies of Japan for over 2000 year s. 
In 1882, Dr. Jigoro Kano, after 
studying three eminent masters of 
Jiu-Jitsu, founded a school of his 
own called Kodokwon, meaning 
'school for studying the way.' He 
used the knowledge he had gained 
to consolidate the best parts of 
all the old clan exercises in Jiu-
Jitsu into one enct SCience, to 
which he gave the name of Judo," 

Schiller says that for exercise, 
self-defense, ofCense, or pure 
sport, Judo has no equal. 11 is 
probably the most fascinating and 
most useful form of physical edu-
cation in the world. Unlike many 
of our sports, Judo develops the 
whole body evenly and without 
strain - not just a portion of it. It 
perhaps has no equal indeveloping 
poise of body and mind. It substi-
tutes skill for brute strength to 
such an extent that it is not at all 
unusual to see a one-hundred-
twenty pound expert reduce a less 
accomplished adversary, weighing 
one-hundred-elghty pounds or 
more, to a helpless and exasper-
ated wreck, all with an astonish-
ingly small amount of effort.

Generally, Judo is suitable for 
all ages and both sexes, from six 
to sixty. Dr. Kano himself actively 
practiced Judo until his death at 
the age of 78, and some ofits most 
ardent devotees are none other than 
the ladies.

The sports program at the Uni-

versity of Call1ornia, San Diego 
has taken a giant step forward this 
year with the gift of a racing she 11 
from UCSO's sister campus to the 
north, UC LA . 

Eight-oar racing shells cost 
more than $3,000 new and are not 
easy for a young campus with a 
growing sports program to acquire 
or afford. 

According to Dr. Ted Forbes , 
Chairman of the Department of 
Physical Education at UCSD, the 
gUt of the shell from UC LA has 
allowed the San Diego campus to 
get into the water and enter into 
competition this year. Without the 
gUt, rowing could not have been 
offered at UCSD for at least an-
other year or two, he said. 

The gift is a 60-foot, eight-oar 
racing shell, ot the type used in 
international, collegiate arid Olym-
pic competition. It Is named the 
"Ben Wall1s", an oarsman and 
coach at Yale UniverSity who later 
started the rowing programs at the 
University of California, Berke ley 
and at UCLA. 

The shell was brought to UCSD 
through the efforts of Mr. Tom 
Ha.m, owner of the BaU Hal Res-
tauunt and a rowing enthuslut. 

ets UCLA Sltell 
It was presented to Dr. Forbes 
and John Slaybaugh, crew coach at 
UCSD, by JOM Bisset, crew coach 
at UCLA. The ceremony took place 
at the UCSD boat house on Santa 
Clara Point in Mission Bay. 

According to Slaybaugh, who is 
a graduate student in Aerospace 

Engineering in addition to crew 
coach. UCSO has 23 varsity and 
freshmen oarsmen working out 
each morning at 6:00 a.m. in Mis-
Sion Bay. Slaybaugh served for 
three years as cOJ(swa.in for the 
Princeton University varsity crew 
and came to UCSD as a graduate 
student last fall.

Radio KSDT Needs Help 
Radio KSDT, the campus radio 

station Is now in a critical phase 
01 development. The stall that is 
now being formed wUl determine 
the quality and content of the sta-
tion as well as future policy. Since 
Radio KSDT is a student owned and 
and operated station, its staff must 
be made entirely ot student volun-
teers. A large staff is necessary 
to operate the station and includes 
many assorted fields ranglngfrom 
artists for publicity to computer 
programers to develop a record 
classification system. Radio KSDT 
has openings for just about every-
one with any kind of interest. 

The two main aspects of the radio 
station are engineering and pro-
graming. Under the direction of 
Dave Geren an efficient engineer-
Ing stalf is being formed. This 
staff Is necessary now to complete 
the carrier current system as soon 
as possible. Also the station's 
transmitter must be built and the 

training studio must be constructed 
and wired. A secretary who has in-
terest In this area is desperately 
needed. 

Program director Jon Collins 
has seperated programming into 
tour phases, Muslc,SpeclalEvents 
News, and Sports. Besides the nor-
malvariety of musical shows, this 
section Includes the formation of 
special musical presentations. The 
development of these shows is open 
tor suggestions. 

The special events phase, led by 
steve Clark, is dedicated to pre-
senting its listeners with Intrigu-
ing programs to provide greater 
awarness of the surrounding world 
and ofler viewpoints not otherwise 
easily avallable. Ideas and sources 
for this type of programming are 
needed along with the manpower 
to research such ideas. Live and 
remote broadcasts are also a part 
ot this phase. 

The news and sports phases are 

closely related. They would cover 
and report mostly campus events. 
Live coverage would also be a in-
tegral part of news and sports. 
This stalf would be required to 
jockey their own programs. 

Aproduction staff would be re-
quired to help produce all pro-
grams and to make spots and an-
nouncements for the staUon. 

Help in other areas is also need-
ed. Secretaries, who can put in 
two hours a week, are needed to 
help with the large volumes of 
correspondence. Artists, record 
librarianS, composers and just 
about any other facets you van 
think of are needed. 

For radio KSDT to be a suc-
cessful communications link on 
campus, the students MUST active-
ly participate. Informal interviews 
will be conducted over the next 
few weeks. To arrange for an ap-
pointment, please contact Marc 
Rothman at 755-3837 or ext. 1918.

"Reflections in a Golden Eye", 
is a tense, gripping and extremely 
unusual new tum, which will pri-

audience and will be no doubt 
lauded by a greater percentage of 
critics than general public. 

This is in no way derogatory

Carson McCullers' eerie novel, it 
is a fine film with truly marvelous 
acting from Marlon Brando and

For many years, O'Hara and his

with homosexual tendancies whose 
solitary trenzy of fear and anger 
is awesome as it approaches in-
sanity. His arrogant, cruel, and 
promiscuous wife is played by 
Elizabeth Taylor, who once again 
proves herself one of the few con-
sistently fine actresses in the film 
industry. Her role is at times 
reminiscent oC "Cat on a Hot Tin 
Roof". 

Brando, an instructor In war 
strategy with many already strange 
habits, eventually becomes more 
and more oblivious to events sur-
rounding him, including his wife's 
unfaithfulness. When, during a 
thrilling horseback sequence, he 
fails in an irrational attempt to 
prove that he Is a man, he ex-
presses childish fury. Brando gra-
dually becomes conscious only of 
an attraction he has for his hired 
gardner, an enllsted man who is 
quite abnormally obsessed with 
his wife. This leads to a powerful 
and pxplosive climax. 

Director John Huston's handling 
of the film was excellent and he 
adeptly develops a sense of vul-
garity and ennui. Julle Harris is 
also quite effective as the III wife 
of Taylor's illicit lover. 

The haunting musical score Is 
perfect and the art direction is 
very unusual indeed. The film was 
shot in severely muted technlcolor, 

which appears black and white with 
tinges of red appearing at various 
Intervals: a sweater, a rose, the 
bruises on Brando's face. 

It is true that there is a definite 
lack of plot, and one may complain 
that the spirit of the McCuller s' 
novel has been lost. It can also be 
argued that the conclusion is abrupt 
and unsatisfactory considering the 
intricate development of the char-
acters and of a feeling of gross 
degeneration beneath a surface of 
seeming nor malty. However, the 
characterizations are shattering; 
although the film-goer will perhaps 
be disappointed, "Reflections in a 
Golden Eye" is well worth con-
sidering.

TheatreS Forms Workshop 

Theatre Five, the avant garde 
theatre group in Pacific Beach, 
is in the process of staging Fer-
nando Arrabal's two one-act plays, 
"Orizon II and "Fando and Lis." 
With an emphasis on the experi-
mental and the production of un-
published material the theatre 
group hopes to widen its stance 
and is proposing three methods 
to accomplish this. 

On November 19 there was an 
organizational meeting for the for-
mation of a theatre workshop, 
consisting of eight Sunday meetings 
to be held from 2:00 to 5:00 

at the Pacidic Beach theatre, 751 
Turquoise Street. There w1l1 be 
instruction in acting, mime, and 
direction taught by the theatre 
group' s director Robert Glaudini. 
The workshop wilf arso 00 iriteres-
ted in instructing art students ' 
who would work in set designing. 
The workshop wUl cost $10 for the 
eight meetings and will aim to-
ward the integration of the work-
shop members into the Theatre 
Five group itself. 

Another form which the broaden-
ing will take is the forthcoming 
casting for the company's next 

production. Reading for the parts 
in the Italian play "The Three 
Cuckolds" was he ld last night 
at 7:30 in the company's theatre. 
The play is an anonymous piece 
in the Comedia Del Arte style 
and supports a large cast. 

Consistent with their emphasis 
on giving voice to as yet unpub-
lished material the group wUl 
caB upon the community when they 
consider their third production. 

It is the intention of the group 
to put out a request for material 
by local playwrights and to pro-
duce one of the works. 

An enthusiastic group,"Up With People," returns to San Diego today. UC Opens Greelc Center 
'Up With People' Group 
Returns to Civic Theatre 

Edited b y Chris Pendleton 

New plans for the 1968 opening 
of the University of California 
study Center for Classical Drama 
in Greece were announced today by 
Hugh Gray, UCLA Theatre Arts 
professor and director of the pro-
gram. The 1968 program will in-
clude a number of course changes 
and innovations of significance. 
The project takes place during the 
spring and summer quarters with 
students of the theatre living and 
studying first in Athens and some-
what later in historic Delphi, where 

the Greek drama was born. Some 
twenty-five students will partici-
pate, according to Professor Gray. 
They will include a smaB number 
of European and non-California 
American students. 

New features of the program in-
clude a greater emphasis on the 
classics during the initial stages 
of enrollment, more freedom in 
housing arrangements for graduate 
students, as weH as a heightened 
emphasIs on directing and acting. 
The study of Classical or Modern 

Greek wUl no longer be a standard 
course requirement, but all stu-
dents will still be obliged to take 
a crash course in Modern Greek 
for the first two weeks of the pro-
gram. Also new efforts will be 
made to introduce all students to 
both ancient and modern aspects of 
Greek cultural life. 

"Up With People," the inter-
nationally acclaimed Sing-Out 
traveillng group who performed 
at UCSD and three other colleges, 
six high schools, the Naval Train-
ing Center, MCRD and 3 nights 
in the Civic Theater last year 
are slated for a return three-
night run at the Civic Theater, 
Friday, November 24th through 
26th. This unique production 
features a cast of 200 high school 
and college students from every 
race and background representing 
all 50 states and 21 countries. 
"Up With People" entertains its 
audiences with musical and 
choreographic selections featuring 
33 original songs. 

with this and down with that." 
Paul got the idea of Up With People 
to help create a positive rather 
than negative attitude. Although 
the music is written and sung 
by young people in Up With People, 
it is enjoyed by old and young 
alike. Their songs are born out 
of the need of the age we live 
in--they stir the imagination of 
a generation which is searching 
for meaning in life. Their Up With

by a writer: "a combination of 
old time revival, choir concert--
all set to a folk-rock beat." 

AMES Gets $2 Million 

The Study Center in Classical 
Drama Is a part of the University-
wide Education Abroad Program. 
Unl1ke the other Study Centers 
throughout the world, the program 
in Greece is highly specialized in 
one specific field. However, ac-
cording to Professor Gray, other 
students who have a special in-
terest In history or the classics 
combined with the desire to work 
with the theatre, are urged to 
apply. 

Their fast paced two-hour show 
demonstrates in mus ic a positive 
dynamic idea that has enthralled 
audiences wherever it is seen. 
The theme song of the show "Up 
With People" is one of the most 
popular numbers and has been 
sung on and off stage by thou-
sands in at least nine languages. 
The hit was written by Paul Col-
well, one of the members of the 
three national travelling casts of 
"Up With People" because as he 
said, "People are saying down 

"Up Wih People" will arrive 
in San Diego today, Wednesday, 
at 4:00 pm. Mayor Curran and 
members of the City Council will 
officially greet the troupe in the 
Community Concourse Plaza. Ma-
rine Gunnery Sgt. J. E. Howard, 
Congressional Medalot Honor hero 
Cor whom the cast gave a special 
showing in September in Chicago 
will be on hand to greet them. 
San Diego's local group of 'Up 
With People,' "Let's Go San Di-
ego" will be Singing in the Plaza 
when the Up With People cast 
arrive and will greet the members 
of the cast

Department has acquired a two 
mUlion dollar analog computer. 
The new computer is a huge sys-
tem that takes up approximately 
2500 square feet of space In USB

The computer solves problems 
by simulating a system, integrating 
and solving differential equations. 
The computer has eight consoles

"What does IBM offer a 
Ph.D? I'd say diversity. But 
judge for you rse lf when 
they' re here December 4th 
t hrough December 5th." 
"I think IBM's worth listening to because the advantages 
that attracted me are even stronger today. (This is Gary 
Kozak , Ph.D . in Analytical·Physical Chemistry, an IBM 
Development Chemist and Project Manager.) 

"At IBM you're constantly working with people doing 
advanced work in many different fields. That's a great asset 
to any scientist because today's problems are often 
interdisciplinary. You can't solve them with one kind of 
background. You need inputs from three or four different 
kinds of people. 

"A good example is the solid logic technology used in 
building the IBM System/360. The EE tells you how many 
conductors you'll have, where they go, and what should be 
at the terminals. An ME designs fixturing and automatic 
processes. A Polymer Chemist formulates insulators 
and says how they should be used. The Metallurgist 
specifies alloy compositions. The Physicist decides how to 
optimize a process for producing transistors and diodes. 
And all these people have to talk with each other and 
help each other. 

"It's a stimulating environment, and it keeps you tech· 
nologically sharp. Of course, to do all this interfacing with 
other disciplines, you need a free and informal atmosphere, 
and IBM has it. It's a good place for a scientist to work." 

There's more to the IBM story than Gary has mentioned , 
You can get all the facts when we interview Ph.D:s on 
campus. Make an appointment at your placement office, 
even If you're headed fOT military service. 
Or if you can't make a campus interview, send an outline 
of your interests and educational background to 
Mr. L. H. Covert, IBM, Armonk, il rn ~ 
N.Y. 10504. We're an equal 0

Heidi Ho, Where are You? The 
Post Office is looking for you (to 
deliver your man). 

Mr. Roy Nelson, one man looking 
for Heidi Ho, is the manbehindthe 
counter in the Revelle College Post

is sent with their box number on 
it but with no reference to the 
school. Mail delivery will be de-
layed if this reference is made be-
cause it will then be sent to the 
UCSD mail r oom. 

The Young Republicans are cir-
culating petitions in order to sup-

This is 
the "something good" 

you've been 
looking for. 

When you go shopping for "something really good" In stereo 
equipment, you usually have to pay more than you expected, 
or settle for something less than you expected. 

The KLH ' ModelTwenty-Four changes that situation radically. 
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete stereo music system. 

Its performance and sound quality are close-very close-to 
that of the best equipment that KLH , or anyone else, makes. 
But it costs only a fraction of what it sounds like. And it fits 
gracefully into any living room. 

There's nothing missing from the Model Twenty-Four. It 
has a sensitive, drift·free FM stereo tuner, a custom·made 
Garrard record changer with Pickering cartridge and diamond 
stylus, plus jacks for external equipment and for making tape 
recordings. The solid-state circuitry is powerful enough for 
any living room, and the unobtrusive speaker cabinets contain 
a pair of full -range, two-speaker systems. 

The modest size and price of the Twenty-Four are the result 
of advanced engineering instead of corner-cutting. Everything 
from its components to its oiled-walnut cabinetry is designed 
to provide a genuine surprise rather than that "nice for the 
money" feeling. 

Come see and hear how little it can cost for something 
really good.
