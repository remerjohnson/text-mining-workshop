THE UCSD 

UC SAN DIEGO 

Governor proposes 
mixed UC 'budget 

Plan includes money for modest 
enrollment, salary increases 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
proposed a modest increase in state 
funding for the University of 
California to cover student enroIl-
ment growth and higher salaries in 
an annual state budget unveiled on 
Jan. 10. 

If approved by the state 
Legislature, the plan would fulfill 
the terms of a multiyear funding 
compact the governor signed with 
the state's higher education leaders 
in 2004. 

"The governor's overall budget 
proposal for UC is very welcome 
after years of cuts," UC President 
Roben C. Dynes stated in a univer-
sity announcement released several 
hours after Schwarzenegger's pre-
sentation. "The governor has ful-
filled his commitments under the 
compact, providing many of the 
basic resources we need to begin 
rebuilding our programs and to 
sustain our contributions to 
California's economic competitive-
ness and quality of life." 

Under the proposed plan, the 
university will receive approxi-
mately $2.8 billion of state doIlars, 
an increase of $97.5 million or 3.6 
percent from the year before. 
However, the money would restore 
roughly half of the cuts the univer-
sity absorbed in the current fiscal 
year, and is more than S500 miIlion 
below what it received in 2001-02 . 

"This budget is not everything 
that I want, but the fact is , it's a 
budget forced on us by a broken 
system," Schwarzenegger said at 
the budget announcement. "There 
is great virtue in providing services 
to the people. But it is also virtuous 
to be wise and responsible with the 
hard-earned tax money the people 
pay to their government." -

Included in the university'S 
increase is $14 miIlion in one-time 
funding to allow for the opening of 
UC Merced in fall 2005. Under the 
plan, the university will enroll 
1,000 students in its first year, 600 
of them freshmen.

Symposium celebrates Revelle 
Global warming talk part of anniversary 

By USAMAK 
Associate News Editor 

As a tribute to the late Roger 
Revelle, who was one of the first 
scientists to recognize the effects 
of atmospheric carbon dioxide on 
global warming, several UCSD 
scientists gathered on Jan. 11 in 
York HaIl to speak about the 
human impacts on climate change. 

The panel of speakers com-
prised the first of several global 
warming symposia scheduled as a 
part of the 40th anniversary of 
Revelle College. 

The event began with a look 
back at Revelle's life and scientific 
work. ReveIle first made contribu-
tions to oceanography as a gradu-
ate student at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. 
Later, he become director of SIO 
and also served as one of the 
founding forces of UCSD in 1960. 

"Roger was a father of UCSD, 
but he was also a father of global 
warming research," Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox said. "This sym-
posium is, I believe, a fitting trib-
ute to [his] impact on U.S. science 
and U .S. higher education." 

Throughout his lifetime, 
Revelle also gave expert advice on 
issues including the environment, 
agriculture and human popula-
tions. In addition to serving as sci-
ence adviser to the Secretary of 
the Interior, he received the

spoke on the effects of global warming at a Jan. 11 symposium in York Hall. 
National Medal of Science from 
President George Bush in 1990. 

"Most of us saw Roger to be an 
inspirational, charismatic col -
league - not an organized admin-
istrator," said Hugh Bradner, pro-
fessor emeritus of mechanical and 
aerospace engineering and of the 
Institute of Geophysics and 
Planetary Physics. "He was some-
times likened to a juggler with too 
many objects in the air. Just before 
one would crash on the floor, 
Roger would catch it with his size-
15 shoe and restore things up to 
their proper order." 

During the second half of the 

event, faculty members made brief 
presentations on the various bio-
logical impacts of global warming 
and other human activities. 

According to biology professor 
Milton Saier, the world's current 
population of 6.3 bill ion people is 
still rapidly expanding at a rate of 
about 250,000 new births per day. 
Human activities add six billion 
tons of carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere every year, while only 
1 percent of that amount can be 
recycled by the photosynthetic 
capacity of the Earth, he said.

Dining halls to end tomato rationing 
Storms, hurricanes cause of produce shortage 

By SHANNON EUOT 
Senior Staff Writer 

Restaurateurs and sandwich 
aficionados can rest easy as the 
worst stage of a two-month 
national tomato shortage has 
passed. Attributed to unexpected 
and severe weather conditions 
that damaged tomato crops, the 
national shortage prompted 
UCSD dining halls and other 
food businesses to serve the fruit 
only upon request or eliminate it 
from menus altogether. 

Florida and California, which 
constitute the top two fresh toma-
to-producing states in the nation, 
both suffered unusually harsh 
weather conditions this fall, which 
resulted in high prices. 

In Florida, the state that pro-
duces virtually all of the fresh-
market, field-grown tomatoes in 
the country during the winter, 
hurricanes damaged 65 percent of 
the state's usual crop, according to 
the Florida Tomato Committee. 

A severe storm hitting central 
California on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20 
aho damaged a portion of the 
state's fall tomato crop and tem-
porarily suspended harvest. Just 
one week later, a second storm 

descended on central and south-
ern portions of the state, affecting 
nearly all of the remaining tomato 
yield. 

Signs stating that tomatoes 
would not be served unless 
requested appeared in some din-
ing hall windows. 

California's tomatoes come 
primarily from Baja California in 
the summer, and from other parts 
of Mexico during the winter. 
However, there is often a six-week 

gap between the two crop cycles 
that Florida typicall y covers. 
Because Florida's crop was 
destroyed by various storms, 
tomato prices increased and 
UCSD chose to forego buyi ng it 
usual quantities, accordi ng to 
Housing and Dining Services 
Associate Director Brian Klippel. 

"Florida is usually the interim 
producer, but their entire first

Staff Writer 

After a dramatic 71-70 over-
time victory over Cal State 
Stanislaus gave the UCSD men's 
basketball team its first winning 
streak of the season on Jan. 7, a 
horrid shooting night against 
Chico State ended that strealc. 
The Tritons now find themselves 
5-5 overall and 2-2 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play. 

After giving up a five-point 
lead in the final twO minutes at 
Warrior Arena to allow the Cal 
State Stanislaus to force overtime, 
the Tritons got to the line on two 
separate occasions in the final 
minute, with junior guard/forward 
David Retzlaff providing the win-
ning margin after converting one 
of two from the line with five sec-
onds left. 

A three-point attempt by 
Warrior sophomore Marcus 
Martinez bounced off the rim as 
the game ended. 

UCSD had double-digit scor-
ing from four players, including 
Retzlaff and freshman guard Clint 
Allard, who paced the team with 
14 each, and freshman guard 
Andrew Hatch, who put in 13 
while collecting a game-high nine 
rebounds and recording two 
steals. 

Sophomore forward Parker 
Berling filled up a stat line with 
nine points, seven rebounds, two 
steals and a game-high two 
blocks. 

Junior forward Kaving Young 
led the Warriors, scoring a 
game-high 21 points on 9-of-14 
shooting from the field . Junior 
guard Jesse Sa tterfield added 14 
points on 4-of-7 shooting and 

.junior forward Joel Stallworth 
came off the bench to give six 
points and seven rebounds in 11 
minuees. 

Cal State Stanislaus senior Rid 

Fretter had 11 points, sinlcing 2-
of-5 three-point attempts, includ-
ing the long-range shot with three 
seconds left that sent the game 
into overtime. 

The Tritons persevered due in 
large pan to a .510 field goal per-
centage and a .444 percentage 
from behind the three-point arc. 

The Warriors, still winless in 
CCAA play, shot a dismal .410 
from the field and a frustrating 
.214 from three-point range. 

The Tritons were the ones suf-
fering from poor shooting on the 
evening of Jan. 8 when they fell, 
80-54, to Chico State at Aclcer 
Gymnasium. 

The Wildcats went on a 17-4 
run in the first half to push the 
score to 25-12. The Tritons 
refused to go down early, climb-
ing at one point to within six, 
before heading into halftime 
down nine. 

However, the Wildcats, who 
forced 2 I turnovers and outre-
bounded the Tritons, 39-28, 
clamped down in the second half, 
allowing only one field goal 
through the first \3 minutes of the 
second half as they built a 25-point 
lead that the Tritons could never 
significantly dent. 

Chico State was led by 15 
points each from senior guard 
Scott Land and reserve senior 
guard Colin Carr, who connected 
on 4-of-8 three-point attempts 
coming off the bench. Senior 
point guard Tim Haley was solid, 
handing out nine assists to go

steals.

Tritons deliver against Berkeley, · then drop straight sets to Lancers 
Defending NAIA champs stifle men's volleyball squad at regular season home opener 

By RAEL ENnEN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD followed an easy exhibi-
tion win over Cal on Jan. 7 with a 
loss in straight sets to California 
Baptist on Jan. 8 at RIMAC Arena 
in the team's regular season opener. 

With the 3-0 loss to the 
Lancers, the Tritons fell to 0-1 on 
the season, while Cal Baptist 
improved to 2-0. The Tritons made 
every set close, with 30-23, 30-22 
and 30-25 losses, but the Lancers 
dominated throughout. Three Cal 
Baptist players had double-digit kill 
stats, including junior Seidu 
Ajanako, who had 18 kills and 19 
points. 

Across the net, UCSD junior 
Lulce Honnette hit .393 and led the 
Tritons with 13 kills and 14.5 
points. As a tcam, however, the 
Tritons were outhit, .442 to .124. 
The abysmal percentage was a huge 
factor in the Tritons' loss. 

Cal Baptist - which in 2004 
won its third National Association 
of Intercollegiate Athletics title in 
the program's six year existence-
outplayed the Tritons in every 
aspect of the game. UCSD was 
outblocked, 11-6, and out1cilled, 
56-37. 

If these perfonnances continue, 
the Tritons could be looking at 

another disappointing season. Last 
year, UCSD finished with an 8-21 
record and was far from a postsea-
son berth. 

While the straight-set loss was 
not what the Tritons were loolcing 
for, several UCSD athletes played 
exceptional games. 

In addition to Honnette's 
impressive stats, junior Adam 
Rusch had seven kills and fresh-
man Mike Reuter contributed five . 
Also, junior Nate Jones tallied 18 
assists and freshman Broolcs 
Dierdorff helped out with 17 
assists. Both Jones and Dierdorff 
are Triton setters and shared time 
in the game. 

The Lancers had their fair share 
of stars, too, as senior Shaun Dylc 
and sophomore Shamsu Awudu 
shone with 14 and II kills, respec-
tively. Meanwhile, the Lancer set-
ter, senior Trevor Johnson, 
upstaged the Jones-Dierdorff duo 
with 49 assists. 

Despite the team's disappoint-
ing performance against Cal 
Baptist, the game against Berkeley 
painted a far different picture. 

The Tritons annihilated the 
Bears in three straight sets, 30-15, 
30-24 and 30-23, providing fans 
with a hopeful oudook for the reg-
ular season. 

The Tritons' dominance was 

obvious throughout the game as 
they outhit their opponents, .457-
.366, more than three times better 
than their performance against Cal 
Baptist. 

Honnette was the star for the 
Tritons again with 12 kills and a 
.526 hitting percentage. Rusch 
helped out with seven kills and a 
superb .875 attack percentage. 

Redshirt John Mark Wendler, 
freshman Russ Hardy and Reuter 
had five lcills each. As a team, 
UCSD outbloclced Berkeley, 14.5-
0, with Wendler, Honnette and 
Reuter shutting Cal down four 
times each. 

The Jones-Dierdorff team 
worked well in the match, with 
Jones playing. games one and three 
and Dierdorff setting in game two. 
lones had 23 assists and Dierdorff 
had 11 in his one game. 

Cal played well during parts of 
the match, especially games two 
and three. Jeff Sause led the Bears 
with 11 kills while teammate Kris 
Kuchenbecker was close behind 
with 10 kills. 

Although the Tritons would 
prefer to remember the Cal game

Lancers, the exhibition win means

Governor proposes 
mixed UC budget 

Plan includes money for modest

By VLADIMIR KOGAN

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
proposed a modest increase in state 
funding for the University of 
California to cover student enroll-
ment growth and higher salaries in 
an annual state budget unveiled on 
Jan. 10. 

If approved by the state 
Legislature, the plan would fulfill 
the terms of a multiyear funding 
compact the governor signed with 
the state's higher education leaders 
in 2004. 

"The governor's overall budget

filled his commitments under the 
compact, providing many of the 
basic resources we need to begin 
rebuilding our programs and to 
sustain our contributions to

Under the proposed plan, the 
university will receive approxi-
mately 52.8 billion of state dollars, 
an increase of $97.5 million or 3.6 
percent from the year before. 
However, the money would restore 
roughly half of the cuts the univer-
sity absorbed in the current fiscal 
year, and is more than $500 million 
below what it received in 200 1-02. 

"This budget is not everything

Included in the university'S 
increase is $14 million in one-time 
funding to allow for the opening of

plan, the university will enroll 
1,000 students in its first year, 600 
of them freshmen.

would help smooth the way for a democratic 
transition in Iraq. 

Speaking in what he called an "intellectual 
and academic discussion" that did not reflect 
official government policy or views, Eyre 
described his experience as an interagency 
coordinator for the Office of Iraqi 
Reconstruction. 

"The best I can say is that we have not lost 
ye~" Eyre said, citinS an armed insurgency in 
the country that continues to grow in numbers. 

In addition, American troops and Iraqi offi-
cials continue to struggle to provide essential 
services for the populace, he said, even as the 
emerging Iraqi security forces struggle from 
attrition rates as high as 30 percent. 

Despite continued violence in the cC\Jntry, 
Eyre said peaceful elections remained one of 
few options to try to improve the lives of Iraqis 
and prevent the emergence of a new terrorist 
threat 

"There was not a link between Saddam 
Hussein and al-Qaida,' he said. 'However, if 
we do not resolve these issues ... it will be a 
problem in the global war on terrorism:' 

Study: Tobacco-sponsored 
parties target students 

College students may be particularly vulnera-
ble to a widespread tobacco industry marketing 
strategy that involves the sponsorship of social 
events and parties, a new national study by the 
Harvard School of Public Health has found. 

Students at all but one university in the 
country reported attending a tobacco-industry-
sponsored even~ it reported. Though numbers 
differed on various campuses, 8.5 percent of 
students overall said they had attended a party 
where free cigarettes were distributed, most 
often at bars and nightclubs. 

"By distributing cigarettes and sponsoring 
these events in bars and on college campuses, 
the tobacco industry promotes the idea that 
cigarettes are an essential part of young adults' 
social lives,' said Nancy Rigotti, director of the 
Tobacco Research and Treatment Center of 
Massachusetts General Hospital. 

The study came out just a week after 
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer 
announced an $11.4 million settlement with 
cigarette maker RJ. Reynolds. 

Filed in the San Diego Superior Court, the 
lawsuit alleged that the company placed 
tobacco advertisements in magazines with 
large teen readership, in violation of a 1998 
national settlement the industry reached with 
states. 

Under the deal, the company will be pro-
hibited from advertising in publications with 
audiences made up of at least 15 percent teen 
readers.

Victor Devore addressed the council on 

behalf of the California Public Interest 
Research Group. According to Devore, 
there will be a meeting to discuss possible 
philanthropic fund~ in order (0 P':0-
vide aid to the tsurutrrtivictims. The meeon, 
will be held in the Senate Chambers on the 
third floor of Price Center onJan. 17. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item A 

The council appoimedJohn Muir College 
senior Steve York for the position of AS. 
Elections Manager. York ran in a failed inde-
pendent bid for the A.S. presidency last spring 
and also competed lmsuccessfuly for the posi-
tion of vice president internal in 2003 . He is 
currendy the editor of the Koala. The 
appoinonent passed with a vote of 15-3-2 . 

Reports 
PresidentJenn Pae 

Pae reported that there will be a Martin 
Luther King Jr. Parade on Jan. 15 from 10 
a.m. to I p.m. Free transportation to and 
from the parade and free food will be pro-
vided at the Sun God parking lot at 8 a.m. 

Vice President External KilO Marquez 
Marquez reported that the UC Student 

Association saw a large number of problems 
with the proposed stue budget. The biggest 
problem, according to Marquez, is the lack 
of funding set aside for university outreach. 

UCSA has planned a campaign to send 
postcards to students. The cards will be 
designed as blank checks, and students will 
be asked to till in the amount of college debt 
they will have incurred by the time they 

graduate. The postcards will then be pre-
sented to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

Security Advisory Committee 
Representative Steven Lei 

Lei reported that the Security Advisory 
Committee l13s discussed the problems of 
car burglaries and the rising bike theft on 
campus. According to the UCSD Police

reported. 

Bookstore Advisory Committee 
Representative Victor Devore 

Devore reported that the Bookstore 
Advisory Committee examined the price of 
textbooks sold at UC D Bookstore. 
According to the committee chair. David K. 
Jordan, the textbook publisher are known 
for increasing the price of textbooks when 
they are bundled with other materials . 

As a result, the committee has proposed 
the creation of a centralized communica-
tion structure between professors. The 
bookstore would help professors to be 
informed of book prices when submitting 
textbook requirements, which would allow 
them to order only the necessary materials, 
he said. 

UCSD Closed Circuit 1V Stations 
Governance Committee Representative 
Chelsea Welch : 

Welch reported tltat the w'!lmittee 
rejected a proposal for campuswide guide-
lines governing student-run television by a 
vote of nine to one. Instead, the committee 
recommended that rules for each college 
station be drafted separately.

' T~lk: Professors fear impact of climate changes 
~~2I . Phyllis Marinesi ~ Multi-Million in Sales M'lho" conrinued from paRe 1 "Environmental issues are more important to mankind in the bios-

phere than terrorism, war or indi-
vidual human life," aier said. 
"Many of our environmental prob-
lems can be traced to our excessive 
human population, yet the United 
States spends hundreds of billions of 
dollars on 'home security' and the 
military, while spending virtually 
nothing for human population con-
trol and environmental protection." 

Director of the Center for 
Marine Biotechnology and 

Biomedicine Bill Fcnical discussed 
the costs of biodiver i ty loss due to 
climate modification, with an 
emphasis on the possible loss of 
natural drug breakthroughs used to 
treat human diseases. 

"Fifty percent of all of the phar-
maceutical products that we have 
today are natural products, and 
many of those that are not natural 
were acnlally synthesized based on 
natural products," Fenical said. 
"Now people look for concrete, 
commercial and economic reasons 
why global warming is important, 

and one of the areas that they cer-
tainly undersrand is their own 
health and their own survival." 

Other professors presented 
information about the impact of 
global warming on animal species 
and the oceans, as well as the impor-
tance of conservation biology. 

The next symposium in the 
series will be held on Jan. 18 and 
will focus on the environmental 
effects of climate change.

crop was ruined," KJippel said. 
"We had to wait for the second 
crops to come in [before we could 
start serving normal quantities]." 

Because tomatoes are funda-
mental to so many dishes prepared 
in the dining halls, KJippel said 
dining facilities could not eliminate 
them altogether in order to save 
money. While certain types of pro-
duce can be replaced, tomatoes had 
no alternative. 

"This happens with other pro-
duce as well, such as melons. The 
cOSt is offset because there's other 
food you can choose from," Klippel 
said. "However, there is no alterna-
tive for tomatoes . We couldn't 
completely eliminate them because 
they are essential to so many things. 
You can 't have lasagna or a BLT 
without tomatoes." 

He estimated that Housing and 
Dining Services normally pays any-
where from $10 to $12 per case of 
tomatoes, with prices always slight-
ly higher in the winter. Dining 
facilities currently pay around $15 
to $18 per casei by contrast, during 

the peak in November, the produce 
cos ted more than $60 per case. 

"There were three things we 
could have done," KJippeJ said. 
"First, we could have simply taken 
the tomatoes off the market. Second, 
we could raise prices. Or third, we 
could try a combination [of buying 
fewer tomatoes and not offering as 
many], which is what we did." 

Klippel said students and cus-
tomers have been very supportive 
during the shortage, and that he has 
gotten no word of any complaints. 

"We generally try to keep cus-
tomers informed and ask for sup-
port," Klippel said. "Many students 
said they could live without [toma-
toes]. Those who wanted them got 
them, while those who could go 
without did so. We never want to 
raise prices if we don't have to." 

Students who were aware of the 
shortage said they understood the 
situation. 

"I had no problem acquiring 
tomatoes during the shortage. 1 gOt 
them when I wanted them," said 
Revelle junior David Parkinson. "I 
didn't think it was that widespread 

because 1 didn't see the effects." 
Revelle junior Gillian Siddall 

said she was also aware of the 
change in policy. 

"1 was a bit bemused because I 
didn't see the tomato shortage 
signs in all the dining halls on cam-
pUSi I only saw them in Cafe 
Ventanas," Siddall said. 

The highest prices and greatest 
shortage came in December, when 
school was out of session, Klippel 
said. After school resumed, tomato 
prices fell significandy as a result of 
suonger tomato shipments ITom 
Florida and Mexico. 

"We did not break even by 
reducing the amount we bought, 
but it wasn't as bad as it could have 
been," K1i ppe! said. 

Fresh-tomato wholesale prices 
averaged 99 cents per pound in 
November, 225 percent above prices 
for the same period a year earlier, 
and the highest level since January 
1990, according to the National 
Agricultural Statistics Service.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the University of Califomia at San Diego. Contents (c) 2005. Views 
expressed herein represent the majority vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily those of the UC Board of 

Regents. the ASUCSD or the members of the wordian staff. 

Enrollment should take priority 
T he ~overnor's budget has left UC administrators with a very tough choice: They 
must pick between expanded uni-
versity access for prospective stu-
dents and increased summer ser-
vices for current students. 

Included in Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's budget is money 
to bring just 3,500 new students to 
UC ca mpuses - no t the originally 
proposed 5,000. To make matters 
worse, that money will bring in 
even fewer students if th e universi-
ty proceeds with its plan to add full 
ummel' school quarters at the four 

re mai ning campuses without 
them. 

If the university moves ahead 

with an expanded summer program 
at UCSD, state funding for the 
program would be deducted from 
the money for enrollment growth 
offered in the budget. 

Clearly, universi ty access for 
qualified students should take pri-
ority over increased university 
operations. Even if all the appropri-
ated money for enrollment growth 
is used to pay for new students, the 
student population would only 
return to its 2003 levels, so divert-
ing these funds for summer instruc-
tion would be irresponsible. 

With the state facing such dire 
financial challenges, now is not the 
time to invest these precious few 
dollars in new programs. 

Students' burden shouldn't rise 
Adetail that might easily be lost in the funding plan for the University of California in 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
recent state budget proposal is that 
the percentage of the cost of educa-
tion that students must pay would 
increase from 32.9 percent to 34.2 
percent. While seemingly innocu-
ous, putting more of the burden on 
students is a move in the wrong 
direction for the state. By increasing 
the burden on students while failing 
to increase taxes, Schwarzenegger 
has essentially decided to tax stu-
dents for going to college while let-
ting the general population off the 
hook, wllich, if anything, is the 

opposite of what he should be 
domg. Even more troubling is the 
university's refusal to publish the 
calculations it uses to derive the 
34.2 percent number in light of a 
recent study alleging tnat UC 
undergraduates actually pay 95 per-
cent of the cost of their education. 

In addition, the increase would 
push the University of California 
closer to the de facto private model 
proposed by the University of 
Virginia. A decrease in the state's 
financial responsibility toward the 
university should come with a com-
mensurate increase in the school's 
autonomy, which at this point is not 
on the horizon. 

Prop. 98 breach made in bad faith 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's decision to default on the $2. 2 billion he promised to 
public schools last year IS not simply 
evidence of poor budgeting, but a 
disheartening indication that our 
deal-making governor's word is not 
as good as some hoped. 

Educators accepted unexpected 
budget reductions last year at 
Schwarzenegger's urging, with the 
understanding that puolic schools 
would be protected from further 
cuts in the near future. By failing to 
restore this funding, the governor's 
budget proposal may renege on 
another guarantee: Proposition 98, 
which ties 40 percent of state spend-
ing to education. 

Whether or not faHing to pay 
back schools is a legal break from the 

initiative, it is a bad show of Faith for 
the states public education system, 
which receIves less funding per pupil 
than the national average, according 
to a recent report by the Rand Corp. 
For children in the nation's richest 
state to be shown such low priority is 
inexcusable, as future Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate and State 
Treasurer Phil Angelides has been 
quick to argue. Even former Govs. 
Pete 'Wilson and Ronald Reagan 
instituted temporary tax hikes when 
in need of a fiscal quick fix. 

Schwarzenegger's strategy of 
closed-door wneelings and dealings 
with state leaders only holds political 
capital if the governor keeps his 
promises - something those with a 
stake in the UC "compact" agree-
ment will be watching closely.

Why Americans need to care 
about world poverty 

Lines in 
the sand 

Ian s. Port 

A s 2005 begins with a host of solemn headlines from just about every-where, you, the American citizen and 
member of the so-called "ownership society," 
need not worry. Your future is safe. 

(Not those of you in the military. My 
advice: Be worried.) 

But as for the rest of us, if the world's cur-
rent problems are any indication, we'll most 
likely be fine - at least for a while. 

You see, there's one gigantic problem in the 
world today. It's causing (or exacerbating) the 
issues behind virtually aJl the sour headlines 
you pass on your way to the Entertainment 
page every morning. Relatively few people in 
this country uffer from it, and if you're read-
ing this, you're probably not one of them. 

It's called poverty. 
This is something a little bit different 

from what you may think. It's not what we call 
the state of not being able to afford an iPod. 
It's more like not being able to afford food . At 
all. Approximately 24,000 people worldwide 
die every day of starvation. Three-fourths of 
them are children under the age of five. 

Hunger often takes lives by weakening 
people so they can't fight off diseases that you 
and I would sneeze at. T hat's also how pover-
ty works. It doesn't kill people outright. It 
just weakens them, so that when something 
- like a war, disease or tsunami - comes 
along, they're defenseless. Or desperate. 

That's pretty much the story behind every 
major conflict today, from the horrors of the 
Boxing Day tsunami and the myriad crises in 
Africa to our own tragic war in the Middle 

East. If you want to know why things are so 
bad, look at how poor everyone is. 

The worst victims of the tsunami disaster 
are the most destitute. inhabitants of coastal 
and island areas, who live in the least pro-
tected areas. Since they have little contact 
with the outside world, many had to wait 
days for relief efforts to reach them. 

Now, those who survived the waves are 
dying because of wounds that were minor a 
week ago. Their cOnuTInnities, already impov-
erished, are now hotbeds for disease, fueled by 
rampant sewage, garbage and debris. 

So while earthquakes aren't exactly pre-
ventable, the apocalyptic scope of the tsunami's 
damage was due largely to the extremely poor 
living conditions of those whom it struck. 
There's one tragedy fueled by poverty. 
Unfortunately, we've still got a world of them. 

Africa, the only continent to get poorer 
over the last 25 years, now has over 28 mil-
lion people infected with AID or HIV 
Though the region holds less than 10 per-
cem of the world's population, it has more 
than 60 percent of all those living with HIV. 

Not at all by coincidence, the world's most 
AIDS-affected region, sub-Saharan Africa, is 
also the world's poorest. It's also one of the 
world's most war-torn . While the tsunami and 
our tragic misadvenrure in Iraq hog headlines 
these days, the world forgets about an unfor-
givable tragedy in Sudan. 

Secretary of State Colin Powell bbeled 
the murder of Darfur residents by a govern-
ment-led Arab force "genocide," the first use 
of that word by a government official to 
describe a situation still occurring. 

That hasn't inspired anyone to do any-
thing about it, even as a film released this 
week, "Hotel Rwanda," reminds us of what 
horrors occurred the last time the world 
ignored genocide in Africa .

V\'hat's behind the genocide in 
Darfur and the civil wars that have 
erupted on and off throughout 
Africa for as long as can be remem-
bered? It's local tribes fighting cor-
rupt governments (and other tribes) 
for land to grow crops on. Food. 

I was wrong when I said earlier 
that we, Americans. need not 
worry. We need to be very worried. 
Because what, really, is the motiva-
tion behind al-Qaida and the ter-
rorists who slaughter our troops 
every day in Iraq? What drives sui-
cide bombers to spend their lives 
killing a few American kids?

Whatever their ideological rea-

He and his teammates return to action at home this week, taking 
on Cal State San Bernardino Wednesday night and Cal State 
Monterey Bay Friday evening. Both games are slated to begin at 
7:30 p.m. 

So as we quietly rack up casual-
ties in Iraq, and as the number of 
people in Africa affected by AIDS 
continues to rise, we Americans 
would do well to remember the stag-
gering number of people who live in 
poverty around the world, those to

While it may first crash upon dis-

poverty will eventually drown us all.

THURSDAY, JANUARY I). Z005 

Budget: University to 
lobby lawmakers for funds 

continued from page I 
which includes next year's 8-per-
cent tuition fee increase already 
approved by the UC Board of 
Regents - would aJso fund a 1.5-
percent general salary increase for 
university employees, the first pay 
hike in several years. 

Including new students at the 
Merced campus, the budget pro-
vides for 2.S-percent enrollment 
growth, expected to account for to 
approximately 5,000 additional 
full -time students. However, under 
the plan, the university will need to 
choose how to split this money to 
pay for new freshman admits and 
the cost of providing full summer 
sessions at the four undergraduate 
campuses that do not currently 
offer complete summer instruction. 

Part of the money could be used 
to pay for a lO-week quarter that 
administrarors have planned to 
introduce at UCSD this summer. 

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Brad Hayward said the 
university has not yet decided how 
much of the enrollment-growth 
funds it will use to pay for summer 
instruction for current students. 

If approved, the governor's plan 
would also force the university to 
return $17.3 million that legislators 
approved last summer to fund pre-
viously deferred incoming fresh-
man. To make up for the loss, the 
budget allows UC officials to use 
money currently sla ted for K-12 
academic "outreach" program or 
student enrollments. The universi-
ty will lobby lawmakers to restore 
the money, Dynes stated. If unsuc-
cessful, the cuts will not affect 
admissions for next fall, but may 
reduce admission in winter and 
spring 2006. 

"We're glad at least that it's not 
worse," UC Student Association 
President Jennifer Lilla said, 
promising that the organization 
would work alongside administra -

tors to try to secure concessions for 
the university during budget nego-
tiations. "I think any budget that 
relies on increases in student fees 
means we sti ll have work ahead ." 

Last summer, UCSA officers 
ran an around-the-clock marathon 
at the state's capital as the July 31 
budget deadline approached, 
anempting to increase pubbc visi-
bility for their cause. 

"It may turn out that we do 
something equally drastic this 
year," Lilla said. 

In its current form, the budget 
proposal would also increase the por-
tion of instructional costs covered by 
student fees by about 1.5 percent -
from slightly under one third of the 
toral funding to 34.2 percent. 

" It's certainly not something 
that anyone welcomes," Hayward 
said. "But it's a function of the fact 
that the state has had some very 
difficult budget years and higher 
education is one of the areas in 
which they have made some signif-
icant cuts over that time ." 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides 
and State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Jack O'Connell , two 
Democrats, both criticized the 
governor's proposal, which includ-
ed moderate funding mcrea e for 
all levels of public educatlon. 

"This budget is wrong for 
California, wrong for our children 
and wrong for our future ," Angelides 
said in a Sacramento press confer-
ence caJled less than two hours after 
Schwarzeneggers announcement. 

Last summer, Ange lide worked 
with UCSA to unveil a radio spot 
featuri ng "American Idol" judge 
Randy Jackson calling on lawmak-
ers to increase higher education 
funding. Angelides is widely 
expected to run for governor in 
2006.

We're aJmost done with the second week of classes and still trying to get into the rhytlun of college life. Some of us have 
returned from studying abroad, some from 
traveling over winter break and others from 
spending time at our homes. Now that 
everyone is back, it becomes increasingly 
impossible for me to ignore the complaint 
repeatedly heard from different students: It 

of things to check out around San 
Diego when you feel as if there is no 

escape from the monotony of campus life. 

CULTURE AND COCKTAILS: 
Don't get put off by the fancy name -

the night is reaJly all about having a few 
drinks and enjoying interesting art. You don't 
have to pretend to be the arty type, either, as 
you will run into aJl kinds of people at this 
event. As part of its Sundown Series. every 
few months the San Diego Museum of Art 
(SOMA) hosts an evening art walk, usually 
featuring its current big exhibition. The 
museum opens its rotunda for a mingling of 
no-host spirits at 6 p.m . Enjoy a refreshing 
martini, or for those under 21, sip on a sweet

Museum admission is $9, and a bar will be 
set up for cocktail purchase. For more infor-

album . reviews 

With rival Jay-Z busy touting his so-called retirement, it's do-or-die time for Nas. Not that 
retirement was ever an option for the 
31-year-old rapper, who has spent 
the last decade trying to meet the 
overblown expectations that fol-
lowed his 1994 debut il/mIlt;e. 

Given the mediocrity of most of 
his recent work, Nas' new double 
album, Sma's Disciple, could have

Streefs Disciple 

Sony 

been the last 
nai I in the cof-
fin. 

Instead, it 
becomes obvi-
ous within the 
first ten min-
***~ utes of disc one 

that Nas has 
finally realized 
his strengths. 

What follows is a well-laid trek 
through Nas' world, past and pre-
sent, where the graphic violence and 
explicit sex is overshadowed by smart 
production and even smarter lyrics. 
Nas has always been a bener lyricist 
than songwriter, but co-producer 
Salaam Remi smartly weaves sam-
ples from George Clinton, Barry 
White and James Brown into the 
album's soul fabric to keep the 25-

song set interesting (this is a true 
double album; no Swtat and Suit 
here). 

The songs run the gamut from 
the aggressive DMX-type beats of 
"Disciple" and "Suicide Bounce" to 
the old-school funk of "No One Else 
in the Room" and " ekou StOry." 
Low points are present but well dis-
persed; "Virgo" isn't helped by its 
lame beat boxing and underwhelm-
ing Ludacris spot. And though Kelis' 
vocals malce "American Way" sizzle, 
the tracks about Kelis get old. (Go 
figure, the two were hitched last 
Saturday.) On the whole, though, 
Strut's Disciplt is proof that Nas can 
still put out a good album. Let's just 
hope we don't have to wait 10 years 
for the next one.

CAFE 976: 
This place is perfect for study-

ing or just hanging out with friends 
over a good cup of coffee and deli-
cious food. The cafe, which is hid-
den in a corner of one of San 
Diego's oldest neighborhoods in 
Pacific Beach, is a charming 1920s 
beach house with a deck and gar-
den. One of the first buildings in 
the area, it was originally a home, 
then used as a school and then an 
antique store before it was turned 
into the coffeehouse bistro it is 
today. A large, impeccably main-
tained garden with tables and chairs 
installed throughom surrounds the 
cafe's wooden deck and patio. This 
place is one of my favorites because 
of its casual, relaxed atmosphere, 
and it is a great escape from 
UCSD. It has wirde s Internet as 
well, which makes getting work 
done even easier. Nibbl e on pas-
tries or indulge in a great selection 
of moderately priced food - from 
soups to pizzas - at lunch time 
while enjoying the latest artwork 

from a featured local artist on the 
walls. For directions and hours, call 
(858) 272-0976. 

THURSDAY NIGHT THING (TNT): 
Hosted by the Museum of 

Contemporary Art (MCA) every 
first Thursday of the month, TNT 
offers the perfect opportunity for 
anyone to get involved in the San 
Diego art community. This free 
event is designed to keep pace with 
the rapid turnover of contemporary 
art in the museum; it is a fresh, up-
to-the-minute view of an that is 
unfamiliar to Southern California. 
It will always feature something 
new, relating to the arr on display 
or the cutting-edge artists present 
for the event. Don't expect to qui-
etly sip a drink and walk through 
galleries - TNT is meant to 
actively engage everyone present. 
The wide variety of events that 
have been offered in the past, from 
DJs and break-dancing lessons to 
poetry readings, does the job. This 
is a very trendy event attended by 
hipsters in the San Diego area - in 
short, a cool place to see and be 
seen. For more information , call

Judy Malone captures 400th

Coach reaps rewards of 29-year dedication to Triton basketball 

By KEW PRAKASH 
Staff Writer 

UCSD women's basketball coach 
Judy Malone gained her 400th career 
win when the Tritons defeated 
Western ew Mexico for the second 
time in the 2004-05 season, during 
the Triton Invitational on Dec. 29. 
The career milestone makes her one 
of the top-20 ranked members of all 
Division.IT coaches in the country. As 
of Jan. 12, her career record is an 
impressive 401-320. 

Malone has proved to be a power-
ful leader throughout her 29 years at 
UCSD. She was one of the founding 
members of the women's basketball 
program at the school when she 
attended the university in the 1970s. 

"I was mad that there was a men 's 
program," Malone said . "So me and a 
few friends rounded up some kids 
who were interested and started the 
program." 

Malone played three seasons with 
UCS D and finished with an all-time 
fourth-ranked record of 1,001 points. 

After graduating with her bache-
lor 's degree in biology in 1974, she 
began her career as the assistant 
coach for the women's team. After 
only two years, she was promoted to 
head coach for the Tritons. 

"The first few years were rough," 
Malone said. "I didn't know what I 
was doing. I thought I knew the 
game but it's so different when you're 
on the [coaching] side. " 

Most coaches have more experi-

ence in assisting before they are pro-
moted to the head position, and 
Malone certainly felt the pressure. 

"After only a few years of coach-
ing, we were playing in one of the 
strongest conferences in our division 
in the nation," she said. 

Despite the challenges, Malone 
worked hard to help the Tritons gain 
national recognition as a Division III 
squad, and UCSD managed to quali-
fy for playoffs five times in six years. 
When UCSD moved up to Division 
II, the program took off and so did 
Malone's career. 

Malone discloses that much of her 
success as a ceach is a result of the 
highly motivated and driven students 
that UCSD attracts. 

"Kids that go to UCSD are driven 
in general to succeed," she said. 
"Anybody with a degree from UCSD 
is sought after for job openings, and 
the kids that go here know that." 

That drive for success extends to 
their performance on the court. One 
of the proudest moments in Malone's 
career is an academic success story of 
a player. A recruit from a junior col-
lege came to play for the Tritons and 
was struggling to keep up in school. 
However, thanks to the support of 
her teammates and coach, by the end 
of her career at UCSD, she was 
doing well both on the court and in 
the classroom, enabling her to grad-
uate, according to Malone. "One of 
the reasons Malone has stayed at 
UCSD so long is because of the 
highly competitive nature of the stu-

dent-athletes. 
Malone's favorite part of coaching 

in this environment is that UCSD 
does not give scholarships; but 
instead promotes strong academics. 
Because there is no money involved, 
Malone knows that every player on 
her coun is playing because she 
wants to, and not for monetary 
rewards. In addition, because athletes 
must be admitted to the school in 
order to play on an athletic team, she 
does not have to worry about "baby-
sitting" her players to make sure that 
they are getting the grades they need 
to remain on the team. 

"They're all smart kids," she said. 
"They stay motivated and do well 
without me forcing them to go to 
study hours or get tutors." 

While Malone loves the fact that 
UCSD attracts great players without 
offering scholarships, she admits that 
it's difficult to compete with other 
schools that offer such advantages. 

The coach is impressed with how 
far her team has come over the years 
and expects a solid season from this 
year's crop of players. 

"We'll probably finish fourth in 
[the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association], behind Chico, Pomona 
and Bakersfield," she said. 

Malone's tireless efforts and pas-
sion for the program placed UCSD 
on the women's basketball map. No 
doubt there is a strong future for 
this team under such an accom-
plished and consistent coach as 
Malone.

Riding the momentum of a hot start to 
its season, the UCSD fencing squad 
wrapped up another strong performance 
at the San Diego Division Open, held at 
Mission Bay High School onJan. 9, and is 
now preparing to enter the heart of its 
schedule as the competition heats up. 

Both the Tritons' men's and women's 
teams are currently ranked first in the 
Intercollegiate Fencing Conference of 
Southern California, and they came out 
eager to show it. In the unique mixed 
competition, men and women faced off 
against one another, rather than in differ-
ent groups. The competition featured 
participants between the ages of 10 and 
50. Despite facing opponents who were 
much older and more experienced than 
themselves, Triton fencers placed in the 
top eight in all three events: epee, sabre 
and foil. 

"Competing at the local level gives us 
the chance to compete against people in the 
San Diego Division," freshman foilist 
Laurel Yianilas said. "All these events also 
give us a chance to bond as a team and sup-
port one another. We all need confidence 
to perform, and our teammates help pro-
vide that when we're out on the strip." 

In mixed epee, freshman Chelsea 
Ambort finished third and senior SCOtt 
Carey eighth. In sabre, freshman Jason 
Runyan took second, junior Bret Martin 
third, senior Adam Qwan seventh and 
sophomore Ashok Pathi eighth. Finally, 
in foil, freshman Cameron Sprowles 
placed sixth, junior Dave Elgroth seventh 
and Yianilos eighth. 

"One of the coolest things about fenc-
ing is that it's really a coed sport," Ambort 
said. "At lower levels, men and women 

can practice and compete together. Basic 
gender stereotypes don't apply in fencing. 
Not only can we compete against one 
another, but we beat each 'other all the 
time, too. This weekend was just a great 
example of that. It was a blast." 

Next up for a select handful of UCSD 
fencers is a trip to Overland Park, Kan., 
where the North American Cup will be 
held from Jan. 14 to Jan. 17. Joining 
Arnbort, Martin, Runyan, Sprowles and 
Yianilos is team captain and epeeist 
Timothy Tibbs. The tournament is a tOp-
tier competition, and only fencers with 
high classifications are eligible to com-
pete. According to head coach Heidi 
Runyan, the competition will be stiff and 
likely to include members of the 2004 
U.S. Olympic Team. 

"Our goal is not only to achieve strong 
results, but also to gain some valuable expe-
rience," said Runyan, who added that she is 
excited that four of the six representatives 
are freshmen, an indication that the team as 
a whole will have a strong core for years to 
come. "I am hoping they return with their 
skills and competitive edge fine-tuned so 
they will be able to excel against their col-
legiate-league opponents." 

Ambort said that also at stake are 
national points that help determine a 
fencer's standing in the U .S. Fencing 
Association. 

"The more you compete and do well 
at these national events, the more points 
you get," she said. "It helps your chances 
down the road, because when they select 
the World Cup and Olympic teams, a big 
factor are these USFA point standings." 

These freshmen aren't the only new 
members playing important roles. 
Runyan herself became head coach of the 
team just this year, after serving two years 
as an assistant under former head coach 

Stuart Lee. 
While this may be Runyan's first year 

as head coach, she is definitely not a 
newcomer to the sport. Boasting over 25 
years of fencing experience, Runyan 
brings quite a resume. An active fencer 
who continues to compete herself, 
Runyan began fencing in college in both 
foil and sabre. Through the years, she 
has compiled a number of impressive 
finishes, including a Pacific Coast 
Championship in sabre as well as silver 
in foil and bronze at the U.S . Nationals 
Team Foil event. Most recently, she 
took silver at the Veteran's Sabre 
Nationals in 2003. 

"[Coach Runyan] has gotten us involved 
in a lot of community activities and events 
like the San Diego Open that get the team 
exposure 10 the community at large," Tibbs 
said. "This has helped us get some more 
respect and recognition, because it estab-
lishes us as more of a foundation. Plus, the 
team gets more fencing experience, which 
is always good." 

Other events on the horizon include 
the Northwestern Duals on Jan. 22, 
which will be held in Chicago. Following 
that, fans will have an opportunity to see 
the Tritons host their second home meet 
of the season on Feb. 5 against Stanford, 
Air Force, Northwestern and Cal Tech. 
The Tritons will send a contingent to the 
Junior Olympics in Arlington, Texas, 
from Feb. 18 through Feb. 21 to test their 
skills against the nation's best. 

In addition to participating in tourna-
ments, the team practices between three 
and four hours a day, four days a week. 
Several team members also train on their 
own time. 

"Fencing is a unique sport that helps 
set UCSD apart from everybody else," 
Yianilos said.
