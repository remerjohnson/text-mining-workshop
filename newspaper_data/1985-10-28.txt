Chancellor's Associates 
honor UCSD faculty 

Three faculty members at 
uc 0 have been recognized by 
the han ellor's AsSOC Iates for 
outstanding teaching, research 
and public service. 

The th rec honorees , David 
Luft, associatc profe or of 
history, John O'Brie n, professor 
of neurosclenccs. and Sa nford 
Lakoff, professor of poli tical 
scie nce, each rece Ived a 
ce rtificate and a $1,000 award 
from the Chancellor's Associates. 

Luft was elected as the 
outstanding rpacher for 1985 . H is 
CIta tion read in part: "He has 
conSis tently earned enthusiastic 
reviews on his tcach ing. 
Whether in large undergraduate 
lectures or graduate ·sem inars he 
challenges students' curiosity 
about histOry. They app reciate 
hIS humorous. enthusiastic 
approach . In the words of one of 
hIS students 'he makes histoty 
come vety much alive .'" 

O' BrIen, a School of MedIcine 
scientist who IS a pIOneer In the 
study of the molecular basis of 
neurologic disorders. was give n 
the award for outstanding 
research. 

"His work in a variety of 
inherited diseases has already 
led to the development of tests 
to identify affected individuals 
and to the prenatal diagnoses of 
several diseases. Dr. O'Brien's 
studies of the genes which 
produced recessive inherited 
neurologic disorders not only 
proVided a basis for 
understanding how gene 
mutations affect the nervous 
system, but also a basis for future 
therapy of affl icted c hildren," 
according to the Associates' 
cita tion . 

Lakoff. the fo unde r of the 
UCSD politi cal science 
depanment , was honored for 
outstanding community service. 
"He has consistently tried to 
enhance public discussion of 
political affai rs," according to his 
citation . "He developed a series 
of se mina rs on international 
security which attracted the 
leading e xperts as well as the 
interested public to examine 

Issues of global survIval. He has 
cons istently tried to provide the 
pub li with knowledge necessaty 
to form JudicIous opinions about 
VItal political subjects." 

Professor home-loan 
program renewed 

A UC loan program whic h 
assists eligible faculty in buying a 
new home has ItS goals of 
helping to recruit and retain key 
professors, UC Rege nts were told 
dUrIng theIr meeting October 18. 

In the 15 months since It has 
been in eXIstence. the UC 
MOl1gage Origination Program 
has closed on 66 loans, with 
more than half of those loans 
going to recruIt new faculty 
members, said teven Mathews, 
director of faculty housing 
programs. 

"I've talked to o ffi cia ls at 
several campuses who say the 
ability to offer suc h loans has 
made the d iffe rence between 
someone coming to their campus 
or going elsewhere ," Mathews 
said. 

In addillon, he saId , several 
amp uses were able to offer the 

loans to faculty who had been 
considering offers from other 
school . "a nd It made the 
dIfference in keeping them 
here," he said . 

Besides hearing the status 
repon . the Regents voted to 
continue funding fo r the 
program, for up to $1 5 mIllion a 
year, once current funding runs 
out in July 1986. 

The program was first funded 
in July 1984 for two years with 
$30 million from unrestricted 
portio;1s of the University's Shon 
Term Investment Pool. The 
University program helps faculty 
save on the cost of buying a 
home by not charging 
application fees and by paying 
many of the one-lime closing 
costs. Such costs. on a $150.000 
home, can range between $3000-
$4000 . Mathews said . 

In addition, he saId , the 
progra m offers mo re liberal 
underwriting of loans, allowing 
fac ulty to allocate up to 40 
percent of their income tOwards 
the home purchase. To be 
eligible, faculty must be 
nominated fo r the loan program 
through their depa nment. 

The average amount of a loan 
was $150,600, and the average 
home price was $222,000. UCSD 
received seven of the 66 loans, 
Mathews said .

Anuro Cruz Porras is a long time member oi the 
Nicaraguan Conservative Parry and an economist 
trained at Georgetown University in the United 
States, according to an Institute of Americas release. 
He jOint;d the Sandinistas in opposition to the 
dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who jailed Cruz 
on twO occasions. FollOWing the revolution against 
Somoza, Cruz served as President of the Central 
Bank, then as a member of the governing junta, and 
later as Nicaragua's ambassador to the United States 
until his resignation in December 1984 in protest 
over Sandinista policies. Cruz was the presidential 
candidate of the Nicaraguan unified oppOsition, the 
Coordinadora , in the November 1984 elections but 
withdrew his candidacy claiming that the electoral 
process was not free. -Dennis Woo

"The demonstracors did 
themselves a disservice." said 
Joseph Grunwald, president of 
the lOA "They made the people 
of the audience more 
sympathetic to Cruz because he 
couldn't be heard ." 

Cruz, who is a leader of the

According to Grunwald . Cruz

Alejandro Maninez, minister of

November 25 . 

Originally both Cruz and 
Maninez were to speak together 
at a panel discussion , but 
Maninez refused to be on the 
same panel as Cruz, Grunwald 
said . 

Protestors chanted, shouted 
and beat drums. making it 
difficult for the a udience to hear 
what Cruz had to say. It was also 
a "d ifficult situation for both 
Cruz and myself to speak under," 
Grunwald said . 

"We hear the contras' side talk 
all the time and it is purposeful 
disinformation by the Reagan 
Administration, the CIA and 
Cruz , who is a puppet," said 
Byron Monon , one of the student 
protestors.

~ALVARADO PARKWAY INSTITUTE 465-4411 
7050 Parkway Drive, La Mesa: CA 92041 



SaY'hello to UCSD, Senor Cruz 
enor Arturo Cruz visited the Institute 01 the Americas last 

Wednesday afternoon around sunset in the hope of convincing a largely 
partisan crowd of academics and wealthy community members that his 
position on the present situation in Nicaragua is a viable one. 

en or Cruz, the recognized spokesman for UNO (United Nicaraguan 
Opposition), has had a rather tumultuous political .career. Some co~sider 
him to be a hearty, moderate diplomat who has ahgned himself with 
those who seek the overthrow of the Sandinista government because 
he truly believes that certain powerful leaders within the rulin.8 parry are 
fermenting a dictatorship of the proletariat, which he, a wealthy banker, 
considers detrimental to state progress. Others believe him to be an 
opportunistic huckster who, when cast into the very undesirable role of 

icaraguan ambassador to the United States in 1980, felt that his 
leadership position in post-revolutionary icaragua as on of the 10 
deSignated member of the pre-election andinista ruling junta, was 
bemg stolen from by men like present President Daniel Ortega and 
Secretary of the Interior Tomas Borges. There are those , too, who believe 
him to be a "facisto ," a "cochino" and a CIA pawn , and it was this 
group who turned out in the greatest numbers to greet him as he 
stepped up to the podium just before dark. 

While Cruz sweated and stalked his way through 30 minutes of 
boring allegations directed against the Sandinistas, up to one hundred 
demonstrators screamed accusations at him 15 feet away from the 
plastiC, transparent tent where the paying audience sat. One could 
barely hear Cruz unless stationed next to a speaker in the back. You 
could, however, hear the drumbeats and chants of the protestors quite 
well. For those folks who had thought that the six-dollar entrance fee 
only inf:luded wme, cheese, crackers and Cruz, the show of force of 
conviction exhibited by the demonstrators came as quite a shock. 
Instead of being treated to a clear, articulate barrage of manipulative 
misinformation by Cruz (the speech turned-out to be a muddled, confused 
barrage of manipulative misinformation for those who could hear it) , the 
audience confronted Sandinistism; by definition, those people who are 
thoroughly enamored with the reformist-revolutionary government in 
Nicaragua. 

Most of the folks we spoke with after Cruz sped away from the 
Institute had mixed feelings about what took place. Although many were 
sympathetic with the demonstrators' cause, (that is, to boot the United 
States and the contras out of Nicaragua), not one of them could 
assimilate what appeared to be a protest for democracy and what they 
felt the protest act contradicted: the first Amendment and Cruz's right to 
free speech without being subjecl to harassment. 

Without further ado, perhaps we can clear up the matter for those 
institutions who are enraged over what happened , namely the Institute 
of the Americas, the San Diego Union, the San Diego Tribune, the federal 
government, the UC Regents and of course, UNO. 

Primarily, Arturo Cruz and his cohorts are not exactly what one would 
call "a stifled voice." In fact, the contras, which Cruz is an integral part 
of, have received $27 million in direct, "humanitarian" aid from the u.s. 

government and upwards of $25 million from "private" sources in the 
United States with which to do whatever they please. Cruz himself is a 
frequent contributor to the New Republic, a widely-read, vaguely liberal 
publication out 01 Washington with a unique abhorence for anything 
that has been labeled "Marxist." The Reagan Administration is launching 
one of the 20th Century's most overt crusades to overthrow the 
Sandinistas - and anyone who has heard his "totalitarian dungeon" 
speeches describing the relatively free society of Nicaragua, knows that 
his rhetorical analogies praising the contras as "freedom fighters" 
borders on the licentious. The CIA. consistent with their other historical 
acts of repression, is conducting an all-out war inside Nicaragua, as 
witnessed by the mass distribution of the "Freedom Fighters Manual," 

whi~h baSically encourages Nicaraguan citizens to destroy their 
economic infrastructure. The mass media, which is very qUickly 
becoming a bastion of nimbleness, has quickly forgotten its lessons on 
colonialism and is now intent on dissolving their reputation as being 
more enlighten~d than the common man . The media's meager coverage 
of the amazing progress made by Nicaraguans under the Sandinistas 
(before the contras and the CIA became organized enough to stagnate 
the economy) can be viewed as blatantly discretionary and very possibly 
directed from above. 

So then , it may not be spokesmen like Arturo Cruz who are having 
their free-speech rights violated , but it may very well be spokespeople 
for the icaraguan people, namely the Sandinistas. It is very rare indeed 
to locate an objective analysis of political movements in and around 
Nicaragua. How frequently do you hear facts such as this one: forty-eight 
out of the 50 commanders of the FDN (the largest contra group) are 
former ational Guardsmen under the deposed dictator,' Anastasio 
Somoza. Who, may we ask Senor Cruz and his supporters, do these 
murdering henchmen represent among the Nicaraguan people? They 
certainly do not represent the campesino, nor the student, nor the 
worker nor most of the business community. They do represent, 
however, Cruz, who ts • wealthy banker, the Reagan Administration, the 
conservative flock and, moreover, further oppression for Nicaragua. 

Now that is what the demonstrators were trying to put across last 
Wednesday much to the chagrin of those who attended to pat Cruz on 
the back. They informed him that he cannot deceive the entire 
American public by dreSSing-up in well-tailored suits and parroting 
Ronald Reagan. If Senor Cruz did not know this before he came to 
UCSD, he does now: when you align yourself with historical brutality 
and desire to convince educated people that you speak in the name of 
democracy, you better arrive well-prepared with facts about those you 
condemn - not pretty phrases. Senor Arturo Cruz did nothing of the 
sort. His talk did little to improve the stature of the contra movement, 
but did quite a bit in the way of strengthening the visibility of the pro-
Sandinista movement here at home. 

At least now the American public here in La Jolla is aware that there 
are two sides to every issue, and that the less frequently heard viewpOint 
will not be silenced so easily, -MjC 

A friend among foes farewell 
By DAVE RICHARD, StaffWnter 

Editor's Note : This is the 
conclusion of an article begun 
Monday by Mr. Richards describing 
his views on selective protest. 

Artashes asked me if I would 
meet with him later that 
afternoon , to discuss life in the 
West. "I want to talk very briefly," 
1 remember him saying, ~just an 
hour or so. I want to learn about 
your country." 1 agreed to the 
meeting and at 6 o'clock that 
night, myself and a friend , met 
with Artashes and his friend 
Sasha outside my hotel. For two 
hours we talked on a bench in a 
park in Leningrad. Sasha sat 
opposite us on another bench to 
make sure we were not being 
watched by the KGB. This type 
of back-up would become 
commonplace as our friendship 
grew. 

Without simply.dictating the 
history of our friendship, let me 
leave you with a very honest 

observation. Artashes was and is 
a scared man. He learned 
English by himself, trudging 
through used and worn novels to 
learn syntax. He did so in fear 
that the knowledge, by the KGB, 
of his interest in the West may 
cost him bOlh professionally and 
physically. The KGB is not very 
sympathetic to the West. He 
listened to international BBC 
broadcasts on a radio he kept in 
his bedroom. Once a KGB 
captain, who was surveying his 
apartment, asked why he had a 
radio and books wrinen in 
Enldish. Artashes replied , matter-
of-facdy, that the books were his 
cousin's and that he was a radio 
hobbyist Artashes never again 
heard from the KGB captain, his 
ploys must have worked -
somehow. 

I have lost contact with 
Artashes. On my last day in the 
Soviet Union before returning 
home I asked him for his 
address. He politely declined. It 

seems that it is common 
knowledge among Russian . 
people that all mail enteri ng the 
Soviet Union from foreign 

countries' is conveniently 
examined by the KGB. He did 
not want to take the risk. I 

agreed that it would not be in 
his best interest. I could see this 
hurt him, we had become good 
friends. To know with such final 
ceruinty that the two of us 
would never again meet was a 

. tremendous blow. As a friend, I 
could not ask him to put himself 
at risk simply to maintain 
contact. I had to understand . 

On the last evening we were 
to see each other, we walked 
around Leningrad and talked 
about what we might do with our 
lives. I said I would like to come 
back to Leningrad some day and 
perhaps we might meet once 
again . He simply smiled. We 
laughed about a few things, 
mostly the Russian slang I sciU 
remember to this day. I tried to 
explain the concept of 
McDonald's to him which was 
utterly hopeless. But, as I 
boarded the subway train back to 
my hotel, Artashes had only one 
thing to say: "Don't forget about 
me." 

How could I? He was a true 
friend. 

I guess it is, in pan, because 
of Artashes that I have mixed 
feelings about the South African 
protest movement. It's not an 
objection through analysis, it 's an 
objection from the gut. We have 
forgotten about the Russian 
people, haven't we? Maybe it is 
naive of me to expect (or anyone 
to care, after aU it's been close to 
70 years since the October 
Revolution . But, if we care for all 
people, on the basis of human 
rights, then let's not forget those 
people throughout the world that 
are denied the opportunities 
which we so often take for 
granted. Let us protest the South 
African government, because in 
the interest of morality, we 
should. But let us not forget the 
many millions who don't even 
have the chance to express their 
opposition. Let us not forget that 
when the Curtain fell, life went 
on. ~

OPINIONS 

The third world: ·profits overtake people 
By JOE WAINIO 

There has been a certain 
conservative backlash to my last 
contribution to The Guardian 
titled "Ignoring the Third World ." 
Part of the article's central theme, 
that President Reagan's plan 10 
spend untold billions of dollars 
on the illusion of a "Star Wars" 
defense is tragically misguided , 
was misinterpreted, however, 
when it was put forth that the 
article called for those billions of 
dollars to instead be "given to 
the Third World as a solution for 
poverty and hunger." 

Part of the reason for the 
misunderstanding, I believe , was 
the article's generally 
presumptuous message. It did 
not really suggest how the United 
States could help the Third 
World acqUire the technology we 
daily take for granted but which, 
in vast regions of the world , is 
beyond the means of most 
people. Rather than delving into 
theories on the causes of 
underdevelopment and what the 
United States could do to foment 
economic development - which 
are highly charged political 
themes and necessarily spark 
disagreement - I attempted to 
point out objective inequalities in 
the global distribution of wealth 
and thereby provoke in students 
some inner questioning on how 
this insanity is allowed to 
continue. 

to the United States as a result of 
capitalism's dynamism, which 
conveniently overlooks that 
economic system's darker side. 
Also, in urging the Third World 
to adopt economies based more 
heavily on free-market principles 
to spur economic development, 
they ignore many fundamental 
realities facing these nations 
today. Armed with information 
from Global Rift by historian L.S. 
Stavrianos of UCSD, I will now 
examine some of these ideas. 

It is no coincidence that most 
Third World countries were once 
colonies of the European 
capitalist powers. The 
mercantilist theory (which 
gUided the colonial powers in 
their treatment of their colonies) 
held that the purpose of the 
colonies was to serve as markets 
for the manufactured goods of 
the colonial powers and sources 
of raw materials for European 
industry. The people, their labor 
and the natural resources of the 
colonies existed for the greater 
good of the European mother 
country. The economies of the 
colonies were designed with the 
idea of meeting the demands of 
the European market; the needs 
of the local economy Simply did 
not matter. The colonial 
economies that developed were 
geared , usually, tOward the 

Third World nations are now in 
debt to the tune of $865 billion , 
according to John SeweD of the 
Overseas Development Council. 
Efforts to develop internally 
integrated economies are almost 
impossible because of the 
onerous burden of that debt. If 
your country's main priority is to 
generate enough dollars to pay 
your huge monthly debt 
payment, and the internal market 
and industry of your economy 
are both very weak, your only 
choice is to endlessly increase 
the export of your natural 
resources or primary products to 
raise the necessary cash. That 
cyclical process contributes 
nothing to the economic 
development of the Third World. 
In the past when the few natural 
resources have run out, or a 
drought or disease has ruined an 
agncultural export crop , Third 
World nations (such as those in 
Cenrral Africa) have experienced 
massive waves of starvallon. 

The idea that free enterprise 
system can somehow lead these 
nations into economic 
development is ludicrous. It is 
ludicrous because the sole 
objective of the capitalist is to 
turn a profit. nOl to feed the 
people. Foreign capitalists do not 
perceive it to be their Job [0 
assure that their actions are 
favorable to the economic 
development of the country in 
which they invest. Some 
domestic capitalists, spurred by 
nationalist sentiment, rnay weD 

I think the misunderstanding 
was caused by a common 
conservative predisposition to 
view the world in a very selective 
way. The central pomt of the 
conserva tives, that "personal 
freedom and property rights 
encourage the hard work and 
creativity" that have provided us 
with our privileged pOSition in 
the world , is certainly nOl a

economIes were largely self·

portrayal of capitalism (which is 
critically flawed) praises the

export crop was useful in 
Europe, however, to which it was 
shipped in order to meet the 
demands of the market economy 
there . The colonies then served 
their purpose as a market for 
European manufactured goods 
and now even had to import 

food . Thus developed a vicious 
cycle of dependency into which 
Third World nations still seek to 
escape. 

The capitalist system inevitably 
led to this colonial expansion;

By KATHY BECKETf 

The recent CongreSSIOnal 
approval of a btll allocating 27 
million dollars for "non-military" 
supplies [or the Nicaraguan 
rebels , commonly known as "the 
omras," was a surpnsi ng and 

significam VICIOI)' for the Reagan 
Administration. The IntensIty of 
the public and CongreSSIOnal 
outrage generated by Reagan's 
mfamous and Illegal deCISIOn III 
mine the Nicaraguan harbors in 
1984 seemed 10 indicate that the 
Administration's use of force In 
Nicaragua had reached 
unacceptable proportions. and 
that any further attempt to use 
military solutions in contending 
with the social and political 
problems in Nicaragua would be 
thwal1ed by Congress. Instead, 
partly as a result of an appeal to 
the public in which Reagan 
equated the contras with the 
freedom fighters of the American 
Revolution, Congress has 
approved the funding of the 
contras for fiscal '85-'86 - a 
decision that will mean another 
year of bloodshed and violence 
for the people of Nicaragua. 

The Reagan Administration's 
desire to fund the connas in 
their fight against the freely 
elected andinista government i 

part of a foreign polky which 
c1allns to "Coster democracy for 
hOlh praCllcal and moral 
reasons." Practically. the 
President feels that we hould 
prevent countries in Central 
America "Crom becommg part of 
the Soviet EmpIre ." ThIS policy 
of intervention, then, is based on 
a perception of communIsm as a 
universally destrucnve anel 
coherent force In modern 
socIety. The Administration has 
chosen to ignore many facts that 
would dispel thIS mispercertlon: 
that communism tS In itsel 
complex and fragmented, that 
there are no known Soviet 
advisors in Nicaragua, that the 
Sandinista government wishes to 
remain unaligned with both 
superpowers, and that the 
Sandinista government is the 
result 'of both a popular 
revolution and a popular 
election. 

The Reagan Administration 
also claims that we have a moral 
responsibility to foster 
democracy because "democracy 
is the best and only condition in 
which human rights can 
flourish." Authoritarian, military 
regimes are seen as more 
desirable than lefti t regimes 

because "they can be changed to 
democracy" and "they stick to 
their own borders. " For thIS 
reason, the United tares 
recognized and supported the 
oppressIve and murderous 
regIme of Somoza In NIcaragua 
,IS well as the violent. right·wing 
faCllon oC the alvadoran 
government led by Robeno 
O'Aubulsson. 

Although there is a Significant 
amount of evidence (of which 
Reagan and the CIA had 
knowledge) pOinting to 
D'Abuisson 's leadership of right-
wing death squads which have 
murdered thousands of innocent 
Salvadorians, the Administration 
professed to "be stumped" by the 
question of who was responsible 
for the killings. 

Congressional requests for 
human rights certification before 
provision of more military aid, 
were ignored while countless 
murders of Salvadorans went unin-
vestigated, unpunished and almost 
unnoticed until the violence 
that had reached an aU-time 
high was brought to the public 's 
attention by the U.S. news 
media. "Fostering democracy" in 
El Salvador, then , consisted of 
three and a half years of active 

explOitation. The economic 
development of the few came at 
the cost of underdevelopment of 
the many. Now the Third World 
faces such an overwhelming 
disadvantage to the developed 
world that any Significant 
progress IS very, very difficult. 

if the government does nOl 
direct the activity in its country 
toward economic development, 
certainly the capitalists will tend 
to do what will bring them the 
greatest return on their 
Investment. not what will 
develop the country. ~

suppOrt for a violent, authoritarian 
regime that had no regard for 
the Ideals and nghts that our

that authoritarian, milital)'

claim that supporting

Unable 10 defeat the 
revolutionaries in EI Salvador, the 
United States has turned its 
attention to the contras. These so· 
called "freedom-fighters" are 
recruited, equipped and paid 
only by the CIA to wage a war 
against the government of 
Nicaragua in which over 60,000 
civilians have been killed. As 
part of this battle against 
Nicaragua, Reagan, in violation 
with international law, directed the 
secret mining of the Nicaraguan 
harbors. This decision was made 
without Congressional approval; 
thus, this attempt to "foster 
democracy" in Nicaragua was 
made througlnm illegal and 
undemocratic process. 

The policy of using 
undemo ratlc means ro "secure

secretly bomb North Vietnamese 
troops and supplies on the 
Cambodian border If the United 
States conunues 10 employ these 
undemocratic processes, the 
legitimacy of democracy itself 
will be called into question. 

But [he Reagan Administration 
has shown no sign of tempering 
its foreign policy in Centra~ 
America. In fact , the United 
States recently declared that it 
will not abide by the World 
Court jurisdiction regarding its 
policy towards Nicaragua. 
President Reagan also withheld 
approval from a bill that would 
require human rights certification 
and impose conditions on 
military assistance in El Salvador, 
claiming that such requirements 
would "distort our effons to 
promote human rights in that 
area." The President did not 
explain how this distonion 
would occur.

OPINIONS 

Those fickled fraternities of foolishness 
By JAMIE OLIFF 

B IFF SPOON HEAD'S big sister Beuphora realized the dim realitY that 
she was not sorority material 
when , much to her surprise, she 
was rejected . 

"But Beuphora," BiIT offered for 
consoling purposes, "the world is 
full of so many opportUnities. 
Don't just sit home eating dried 
apricots! Like my best friend 
Merf says, you are significant 
only insofar as you assen 
yourself1" And with that, 
Beuphora Spoonhead put on her 
favorite pink blouse her Aunt 
Mini had given her on her 17th 
binhday and set out to become 
the next best thing to a Delta Phi 
Epsilon - a Little Sister. 

Beuphora met her good friend 
Grezda at school and told her of 
her plans with much glee and 
excitement Suddenly, from 
across the plaza they sported 
Dreynold Facto, the president of 
Sigma Cow Delta , who quickly 
approached them. 

"Hey Beuphora, you've got 
lipstick on your teeth !" he 
remarked. Grezda then oITered 
Beuphora her compact_mirror. 

"0 be still my hean! You're 
right! I didn't realize it. It is just 
so difficult to see anything 
through these double-adhesive 
fake eyelashes. I must go home 
and re-do it. Excuse me." So they 
excused her. Dreynold then 
turned to Grezda, "I here you 
and Beuphora want to become 
Sigma Cow Delta Little Sisters." 

Listen Grezda, the Sigma 
Cow Deltas are having 
their annual Pumpkin Dance 
on Thursday and a car 
wash tomorrow. We expect you 
and Beuphora to show up for 
both and promote that 
undefeating Delta spirit." 

The Pumpkin Dance turned 
out to be a success, as Beuphora 
got 52 dates and Grezda won the 
Pumpkin Pie eating contest and 
thus earned a dance with 
President Dreynold as a prize. 
Beuphora missed the car wash 
because she "absolutely had to 
wash (her) hair ... ," but Grezda 
attended. 

"Oh Dreynold! You are sooo 
strong!" she sighed as she 
watched him scrub down a red 
Volvo. 

"How'd you like that Little 
Sister Cow meeting held laSt 
night? Hope you got much out of 
it. Beuphora looked very nice, 
didn't she?" 

Grezda faked a smile, 
"Absolutely, but that is only 
because she washed her hair 
eight times beforehand. 1 
personaUy thought it was 
extremely informative and I 
better get in, Dreynold!" she 
shook her fist wildly, very unlike 
the Grezda to which he was 
accustomed. 

"Then show up at the Delta 
meeting tomorrow. And be sure 
to tell Beuphora about it." 

All eyes turned as Beuphora 
sauntered into the Sigma Cow 
Delta meeting room. Grezda W!lS 
with her but that did nor matter 
much to anyone. Suddenly, a 
Delta jumped up and took their 
picture , while another handed a 
slip of paper to each prospective 
Little Sister Cow. 

"Name, class rank, GPA, and 
please write a one-page thesis on 
your contributing factors to the 
Little Sister program. Also, State 
wht:ther you wish to panicipate 

in linear be-be gunning 
intramurals as a Little Cow." 
President Dreynold instructed 
with much authority. 

FinaUy the notorious Sigma 
Cow Delta secret meeting 
occurred whereby cenain Little 
Sister potentials were rejected 
and others eagerly accepted . 
Dreynold held up a photo of 
Liffena Mopp. The masses of 
Deltas looked quickly away. 

"But she's got a high 
GPA ... she's good at sports!" he 
offered on her behalf. 

"Look at the way she does her 
makeup!" a Delta inte~ected , 
"Bright turquoise shadow JUSt 
isn't in anymore. Remember, we 
do 'have a reputation to live up 
to ." 

So Dreynold scrapped her 
existence as a Little Sister Cow 
and held up Beuphora 
Spoon head's photo. The crowd 
cheered and w;n;ed flags, staring 
at her photo, which was 
manufactured by Kodak. 

"Definitely, Dreyold! She is 
great for our image! Who cares if 
she cannot do athletics or 
anything intellectual. Her mere

presence will undoubtedly build 
Delta Status," said Taurus Limbo, 
a prominent Delta senior. 

"But what about Grezda Ippen, 
. her friend? If we don't include 
her, Beuphora might not go 
through with it." The Deltas 
pondered this most delicate 
situation. 

"I think," staned Dreynold's 
roommate Nordan, "that Grezda 
should be a Little Sister Cow. She 
has got that Cow spirit, you 
know." 

And so it went with each 
prospective until at last the 
voting was completed and the 
Deltas had a new batch of Little 
Sister Cows. 

"0 my god! We made it, 
Grezda! That was undoubtedly 
the most exhaustive week I've 
ever had . Imagine! I went 
through twelve packs of Acutrim 
just from sheer nervousness!" 

"Isn't it simply wondrous, 
Beuphora? And Dreynold is such 
a dreamboat! I cannot wait until 
the first linear be-be gunning. 
can you?" 

"You must be kidding. I have 
go to do my laundry. After all, we 
are Little Sister Cows and that 
means responsibility to our 
Deltas!" 

"Well put! It's like my Delta 
big brother Ollen said, we must 
maintain our reputations to 
maintain theirs. How patriotiC! 
Are you planning to be a Little 
Cow winter quarter, too?" 

And with much thought, 
Beuphora slowly and seriously 
replied with much deliberation, 
"Only if I can get a cofor portrait 
made by then . I absolutely could 
not bear their passing around 
that disgusting picture they took 
of me at that meeting. I'd simply 
have to transfer schools if that 
picture circulated again. One of 
my beautiful locks of hair was 
three centimeters out of place!" 
And with that, she ran home, 
fearful that yet another lock of 
hair was out of place. 

"So how'd the Little Sister 
business go?" Biff asked 
Beuphora that evening. 

"Splendid! Piece of cake! I 
suppose I just happen to have 
exactly what those Deltas were 
looking for, which does not 
surprise me in the least, since I 
know I'm everything to 
everybody. It just goes to show, 
BiIT, how much I can do with 
myself that no other girl could 
possibly come close to 
achieving."

California education needs big changes 
By RACHEL FREIFELDER 

Senior Staff Writer 

C ALIFORNlA'S educational system needs drastic changes, according to a 
report by the Assembly 
Subcommittee on Higher 
Education entitled "California 
Higher Education: the Challenge 
of the 21st Century." 

Assemblyman Tom Hayden, 
the report's author, feels the most 
important problems are: (1) the 
overall lack of basic educational 
competency (e.g. literacy), (2) the 
even greater deficiencies in the 
black and Hispanic ropulations 
and (3) the potentia loss of 
American leadership in world 
markets. 

The repon begins with a 
discussion of technological and 
economic competition with 
Pacific Rim nations. Japan, by 
emphasizing math and science 
education, is producing highly 
competent engineers and 
business executives, and may 
soon Leave the United States far 
behind. says Hayden . The 
average IQ and "average level of 
ability" have increased in Japan. 
He describes, in contrast, the 
recession in Silicon Valley, center 
of California's computer industry, 
and the lack of space for 
engineering students in the 
Califomia State University 
sy tern. There is a shortage of 
professors because trained 
engineers do not pursue careers 
in teaching due to salaries far 
lower than those in industry. 

Hayden finds it equally 

distressing that fewer native 
Califomian students study the 
Pacific Rim than the number of 
exchange students from those 
countries. He feels such study is 
necessary to understand the 
cultures and econmics of these 
nations whose intemational 
imponance is increasing. UCSD 
is currently being considered as 
a site for the first graduate 
school of Pacific Basin studies. 

The education of California 
public school students is. in 
general, inadequate, the report 
states. Most workers are panially 
unqualified for their jobs, which 
he says require more training 
than did comparable jobs in the 
pa~t. Because of the 25 percent 
illiteracy rate and the shortage of 
skilled labor, many companies 
train employees in basic skills. 
Hayden describes company 
schools such as Burger King 
University in Rorida, run at the 
enrollment and funding level of 
standard universities , which 
meet with public approval but, 
he says, are less than ideal; they 
"minimize liberal education," are 
funded through tax deductions 
and compete with community 
colleges for vocational students. 

Hayden cites statistics on high 
school and state university 
enrollment and graduation to 
suppon his point that the 
"educational success' is low for 
all students but especially poor 
for non-Asian minorities. 
Seventy-eight percent of white 
ninth graders, 66 percent of both 

. black and Hispanic ninth 

graders and 100 percent of Asian 
ninth graders are expected to 
finish high school; 7.3 percent of 
all students will graduate from a 
UC or state university. These 
statistics make California look 
even worse, Hayden feels. due to 
the burgeoning minority 
populaiton. 

Many school administrators 
attempt to improve education 
through the imposition of 
"higher standards": emphasis on 
basic skiDs, stricter discipline, 
increased graduation 
requirements. Hayden questions 
the value of this:. he says it may 
serve to further discourage 
already low-proficiency students, 
especially those for whom 
English is a second language. "If 
stude nts cannot succeed in 
diluted educational tasks, there is 
little reason to believe they will 
succeed at more rigorous ones," 
says the repon. 

Hayden ascribes pan of the 
problem to a shortage of 
adequately trained and 
enthusiastic teachers, especially 
at the elementary level. 

The changing structure of the 
American family also may change 
the functioning of public schools. 
Only 7 percent of families now 
fit the traditional stereotype of 
father at work, mother at home 
and twO or more children at 
school. The number of single-
parent households is increasing, 
with 23 percent of families now 
consisting of a woman and her 
children. A majority of families 
have no non-working parent. 

t 

Meanwhile, claims Hayden , 
American society is seeing the 
demise of the melting pOI , 
replaced by "cultural 
fragmentation" into discrete 
social classes. 

Since parents have less time to 
socialize their children. the task 
is increasingly left to the public 
schools. 

As solutions, Hayden proposes 
. increasing the "availability" of 
technological and intercultural 
education , in the interest of 
maintaining a competetive 
economy and "increasing quality 
of life ." while improving the 
liberal education of the "well-
rounded" person. Funher. he 
advocates increasing the training 
of aD "human capital" (potential 
workers) and studying the imer-
relationship of aD sectors of 
education (1<-12, community 
colleges, state universities and 
UCs) to determine how they can 
beSt help one another. 

Hayden's report is one in a 
series reviewing the Master Plan 
for Higher Education written in 
the early 1960s by a State 
Assembly subcommittee. It 
planned growth and 
development of the California 
schools for the next 20 years, 
based upon projected population 
growth and demographics. 

A 1973 review showed the 
need for massive revisions due 
to decreased birth rate , increased 
housing costs and the collapse of 
the aerospace industry, all of 
which slowed the growth of 
California's population . ~

P OUCE SAID that despite "a good number of caDs and potential leads which 
haven't gone tOO far," they are 
still searching for the man who 
attacked and raped a UCSD staff 
member on October 16. 

Sergeant Roben Jones said that 
they are che.cking any possible 
leads regarding the rape which 
occurred on the par-course 
fitness track north of the Central 
library in the afternoon. 

Jones also indicated that a 
search of the area where the 
victim was attacked yielded a 
piece of evidence which is not a 
conclusive lead , but should be 
helpful in the investigaton. 

The demand for on-campus 
escorts by the Community 
Service Officers (CSO's) has 
increased since the rape 
incident. 

"The victim," according to 
Sergeant Jones, "is in okay 
condi tion despite the obvious 
trauma of the violent act."

The inside line 
on long distance · 
By BARBARA SOBEL 

AT&rT CLAIMS to pride itself on its service and quality. Mel offers 
lower rates AT&rT, but restricted 
international service. Sprint 
offers the lowest rates but with 
the most restricted service of the 
"big three" long distance 
companies. 

There are several features 
which all three companies share. 
These features include 24 hour 

NOTICE 

seven-day-a-week service, no 
minimum or maximum number 
of calls, no installation or 
monthly service fees, and 
calculated rates on the 
conventional (daytime, evening, 
nightime/weekend) system. All 
three long-distance services offer 
a feature that allows the user to 
charge his or her long-distance 
phone calls when he or she is 
away from home.

Long 
distance 
Continued from page 9 
three companies will have 
adopted an equal access sysrem. 
ThiS means that a subscriber no 
longer has to dial a long string of 
numbers to reach their long-
distance services. Under equal 
access. the subscriber can caU 
from either a dial or tou htone 
phone and will only need to dial 
1 plus the area code and number 
he or she wishes to call. 

AT&T sets the price bases 
upon which MCI and Sprint set 
their respective rates . AT&T 
offers betwee n 40-60 percent off 
the standard phone company 
long-distance rate (Pacillc Bell ). 
During the daytime period, 8am-
5pm, the percentage saved by 
AT& T long-distance phone 
setvice depends on where and 
whe n the user is calling. AT&T 
users that caU berween 5p m and 
I l pm can expect to save 40 
percent over standard long-
distance rates . Berween llpm 
and 8am and all day SatUrday 
and Sunday. AT&T users will 
receive a 60 percent discount 
below standard rates; MCI claims 
to save users 5-35 percent over 
AT&T's discount. In fact, MCi 
users will only save 35 percent 
over AT&T in the first minute of 
a caU. Sprint users can expect to 
get 15 and 5 percent discounts 
over AT&T and MCI respectively. 
Both MCI and Sprint offer 
volume discounts for customers 
whose long-distance bills are 
over $20.00 per month. 
Depending on the time of the 
call , MCi users can save an 
additional 2-9 percent while 
Spri nt subscribers receive 3-15 
percent in additonal savings. 
AT&T has no such service. 

AT&T. a govemment-regulated 
corporation, has the base 
discount price for long distance 
phone services. In the last year, 
AT&T has lowered their rates by 
11 percent. MCl's policy is to 
fluctuate its rates with AT&T's. 
Sprint's long distance rates have 
remained stable with no increase 
or decrease in the last year. 
Recently, AT&T asked the 
government if it could lower its 
rates again. If appproved . this 
rate decrease will occur within 
the next few months . MCI, in 
keeping with their policy to 
mirror AT&T's policy changes, 
will probably decrease their long-
distance rates . Sprint has no 
plans to change their rates in the 
ncar future . 

MCI offers long-distance 
phone service to 34 different 
countries. Sprint, however, only 
offers service to 18 different 
countries. Calling from anywhere 
with a calling card or travel code 
presents several differences 
berween each of the three phone 
services. An AT&T customer who 
resides in California, for 
example, and uses his or her 
calling card from another City in 
Califomia. will see a .50¢ 
surchage added to his or her bill 
for each call. The surcharge 
added to a bill for using an 
AT&T calling card in a state 
other than Californ ia in this 
instance would be $1.05 . MCI 
subscribers who use their calling 
cards will be charged .55¢ 
regardless of where the call was 
made from. Sprint subscribers 
who use their travcl codes will 
not be charged for doi ng so. 
However, although Sprint users 
can call anyone in the US, they 
can o nly use their travel codes in 
370 ci ties. ~

Uncorking reactions to new alcohol policy 
By MEUSSA WEINS"FEIN 

The remnants of last Saturday 
night lay tossed aside in the 
shadow of a eucalyptus tree. An 
empry bottle of Smirnoff looked 
almost lonely as I kic ked it 
further down towards Central 
Library. I wondered how it got 
there. A bottle like that had no 
place on a campus like this. 

It's bad enough there 's little 
social life here, I thought; but 
now that they've changed the 
alcohol policy, it seems they've 
taken away any partying 
potential this school might have 
had . However, curiosiry arose, 
and I had to discover just exactly 
how much life at UCSD has 
changed since the initiation of 
this infamous alcohol policy, 

Although the legal California 
drinking age is 21 , the old 
alcohol policy at UCSD 
implemented in August of 1981 , 
states that one could drink in an 
individual residence or one's 
private space. While another 
section of the old policy states 
that whenever alcoholic 
beverages exist, Other non-
alcoholic beverages must be made 
available; I don't recall ever going 
to a TKE party at the gym where 
there was a Pepsi stand next 10 
the kegs. 

Also, the earher pohcy 
evidently prohIbited Individuals 
from bringing their own 
alcoholic beverages to any 
function . All I know is that it was 
not apple juice in everyone's cup 
at Tioga Hall. After years of 
condoning, the universiry came 
to the conclusion that It was 
responsible for acting as a 
guardian over the new 
population of freshmen and 
sophomores who were not of 
legal dnnking age. 

The new alcohol policy 
prohibits the consumption of 
alcohol in all publIc areas of 
campus housing facHllies. fn 
addition, the campus reSIdent is 
now no longer allowed to 
consume in hIS or her own 
private hving space. 

UCSD's polIce Sergeant Roben 
Jones believes that the new 
policy "will have a pOSItive effect 
on the student res1dents and the 
comrpuniry at large . The 
universiry is dOIng thiS to 
enhance a safe campus 
communiry, to protect people 
from injury and to avoid any 
problems in the future ." 

However, this WIll not deter 
people who are going to drink 
"no matter what." "People who 
find a need to dnnk WIll go 
elsewhere," Jones admits. 

In terms of Iiabiliry, Jones 
rhetorically inquired , "Huw can 
you justify to a parent a kid who 
has had toO much 10 drink and 
goes off Tioga Hall? You can 't " 

Jones explains that one of the 
events that led to the change 10 
the old policy about th ree and a 
half years ago was the annual 
Fogcutter event - a competitive 
drinking contest to see who 
could drink the most without 
passing out. As a result, there 
were passed-out bodies all over 
the place, he said. This evidently 
caused problems and was 
therefore banned. 

Jones added, "If you want to 
go to Arizona or Nevada where 
the drinking age is 18, then fine . 
But right now as we sit here , the 
legal age is 21. We can't 
condone it." 

Jones reported that his 
Monday mornings have been 
quieter since the change in the 
policy, although it is still too 
early to tell if it is a significant 
change. 

There is some fear among 
students and Resident Advisers 
that there will be a change in the 
relationship berween the RAs 

always there available, it passes 
out of their mind; they don't find 
a need for it." 

However, Loren th inks that 
what students do in their own 
private space i their business. "I 
think it's unrealistic of Joe 
Watson to thin k that students 
are not going to drink. I gOt the 
impression when he came to talk 

DR'i 
CAnpUS 

and the dorm reSidents. Chns 
Moore , Muir House adviser, 
agrees, "The relatlonshlp has 
become more formal. People are 
avoiding me, and I'm avoid ing 
them when I walk down the hall 
on Fnday nights You get the 
door closed In your face." 

Moore explaIned that you can't 
stOp people from drinking. "It 's 
almost like dUring prohibition . 
They tOok alcohol away because 
they felt tt would stop a lot of 
problems, but 11 Just caused more 
... 1 can see it now: a UC 
Speakeasy" 

However, Revelle Resident Hall 
Dean,Judlth Edwm, doesn 't 
think that the relationship wIll 
change. ·Students relate to 
students. They interact JUSt as 
they would in any mher 
situation. A good RA should be 
able to balance bemg an enforcer 
and a friend ." 

Revelle RA Stephan Loren also 
agrees that the policy does not 
th reaten his relationship with the 
residents. "In my opinion, 
students don't spend most of 
their time drinking. For the 99 
percent of the time that they're 
not drinking, it's no different. 
For the time they are drinking, 
they go in their rooms and avoid 
me." 

Dean Edwin suggests, "I don't 
think the students will try harder 
to get it. It's like if you put the 
candy jar on the table, it's more 
accessible to the person. The 
person won't have to use other 
means to find it. But if It'S not 

to the RAs that he thought the 
residents were not going to 
dnnk." 

Vice Chancellor Joseph 
Watson states, "There is this idea 
that the only way to have a good 
time IS If there is alcohol 
present We all agree , RAs In 
particular, ,hat the uOlverslry has 
an obligation to proVide 
alternative activities Without 
alcohol .. we don't want alcohol 
to be a pnmary concern ." 

Loren adds, ·People are getting 
out and meeting people without 
the alcohol. Sometimes it 's a 
shock for freshmen because they 
use alcohol as a crutch ." 

MUIr ReSident Dean Pat 
DanylyshaYn-Adams find s it 
particularly difficult to enforce 
the part of the policy that takes 
away the freedom of drinking in 
one'; own private space. "You, as 
a student, have to fo llow the 
state law. If you are under 21 , 
yo u cannot drink." I think we're 
doing the best we can in 
enforcing the policy." 
Danylyshayn -Adams also does 
not think it Will impose much of 
a change on the RA-residem 
relationship. 

It it makes one feel better to 
know that we are not alone , we 
are not alone. The UC Davis 
campus policy does not aUow 
alcohol except in its bar and 
restaurant, which cards its 
customers. However, one may 
have an alcoholic-beverage on 
campus if a certain percentage of 
gue;ts have proper 10. HOL dogs 

and soda are served in place of 
alcohol at TGs. UC Santa Barbara 
has no wri tten policy set on 
campus yet. The UCSB 
newspaper, The Daily Nexus, 
expects that they will have one 
outlined by winter quarter. There 
goes Santa Barbara's reputation , 
UCLA does not allow alcohol on 
campus, but the fraternities 
across the street have plenty of 
it. 

There appears to be a growth 
in the UCSD Greek system this 
year as a result of the change in 
the alcohol policy. The ZBT 
fraterniry preSident, Todd 
Haines, estimated a 25 percent 
rise in rushees. "Last year, only 
15 people showed up at the 

information meeting with the 
IFC (Intra Fraterniry Council), 
This year there were 85. It is 
most likely attributed to the 
change in the alcohol policy." 

As for avoiding cars wrapped 
around rrees; the solution would 
be to drink responsibly. 
According to Danylyshayn-
Adams, ·Students are going to go 
out and find their own alcohol 
whether they go off-campus or 
not. That's something they are 
choosing to do. I'm hoping when 
they do choose to do that, they 
are going to act responsibly. For 
instance, if a group is going to 
go off campus to a party, 
someone is designated to drive 
who will not drink." ~ 

Dr. Richard Whitehill, Counstling and Psychological Services 
dirtctor - the alcohol proposal was interpreted as "one of those 
policies which gets instituted withoUi student inpUl." 

On the origins 
of alcohol policy 
By MARGOT GERBER 

In the earty 1960s when UCSD first opened the doors ro Its 
domlltories, student protell Fneratrd by a strictly enforced "no 
alcohol on the piCmises" policy was umhinkable. AI. this time, 
campuses across the United States were $liD followina the social 
standards carried over from the previous conservative decades. 

In compliance with the moralS of this pre-civil rights, liOCial-
awareness era, studentS generally accepted the university's in loco 
pClrtntis position, which allowed college officals to dictate and 
enforce rules regarding curfews, dormroom visiti"8 hours and 
sexual behaviour. H~ver, the fast moving decade that it was, the 
'60s quicldy became marked by youth's heightened CONCiowncss

Policy Origins 
Continued from page 14 
drinking issue , was the resurrection of alcohol, which replaced 
marijuana as the drug of choice amongst college students, when the 
latter was found less benign than was once thought. 

With this new trend towards alcohol, the university 
administration became concerned about the inconsistency of 
alcohol policy across the campus, especiaDy considering the shift 
in the conceptiorl of thl" university's legal responsibiliry for the 
students' wtll being. AnOther prominent voice urging restructunng 
of the alcohol pohcy came from the community, which was 
experiencing a period of increased awareness of the alarming 
proportion of the population that suffered from alcohol addiction 
and its related crises. 

The policy that was deVised ro accomodate the above mentioned 
problems of the mid-70s, or rather what was left of it nearly ten 
years later, is the policy that returning UCSD StudentS have 
wimesscd wax and wane in srrength qf enforcement in the past 
several years. Recently there has.in been university recoanition 
that expeccations ofbdaavioual standalds and implemeruadons of

committee recommended the inltiaakm of an educational 
program on alcohol abuse, lind also ft establishment of a 
committee which would look iaro the current procedures and 
policy on alcohol to see what revisons weR necessary. 

In April of 1984, Dr. Warson asked Dr. Richard Whitehill, the 
present clinical director of Counseling and Psychological Services, 
and fo rmer assistant and associate vice chancellor for Students 
Affairs from 1973-79 (a position which heavily involved him in the 
formation of general campus policy, including alcohol policy in the 
L970s), to chair a second committee to make recommendations for 
change in the alcohol policy, 

This committee gathered an ad hoc committee which consisred 
of seven senior student development professionals, and asked 
them to draft an initial policy for committee consideration. This 
draft was submitted to Dr. Warson, and pnor to any plans for formal 
publication, Dr. Whitehill says that by circumstances unknown to 
him, the proposal somehow \ovent publit and was interpreted as 
·one of those policies that gets instituted without student input." 

The AS promptly responded to the reform by starting a group 
caKed "Students for Responsible Drinking,"and recommended an 
educatIOnal program on alcohol which Dr. Watson accepted. The 
policy was altered somewhat as a result of AS input, and it went Into 
effect thiS faU , L985, primarily shocking and disheanening resident 
advisers and students who had resided in on-campus housing 
under the old policy.

New religion anticipates space brothers landing

style couch of an old, motherly 
woman, dressed in a white robe, 
Standing in a dOOlway, giving a 
somewhat quizzical smile. The 
walls behind her were paimed a

strange, ctystal-looking castle, 
and eerie lighrs ringing a blue 
checkerboard walkway, winding 
down from the castle to where 
the woman was standing. 

On a corree table , were a few

Religion looks to 
space brothers 

planet Orion )3,000 years ago. 
Th my-three thousand "Space 
Brothers·' scattered to other 
planets, and for a time fought 
"cosmic battles." Uriel and her 
followers were stuck on Earth . 
On her home planet, she was a 
space princess fo r many 
generations; on Earth, she claims 
to have been Cleopatra, the 
Virgin Mary, Mona Lisa and 

claim to recieve transmissions 
from the Space Brothers, which 
have been published in 55 
books. Steven has a couple of the 
books, but he says that they're 
"hard to read ." They even have a 
weekend television show, 
broadcast from "Star Center #1." 

The idea of "the forcc" reaDy 
affected some of these groups . As 
a result, paganisrs even believe in 
a force of some sort. 

Steven thinks that there may 
be "an emerging rnonoitth, an 
emerging mythology, for the 21 St 
Century." He says, "There is this 
combi nation of a reaDy, rcally 
new belief in UfOs, in the force, 
and in life, not necessarily in our 
solar system ... but in other star 
systems and other galaxIes." 
These people believe "that our 
destination is to move away from 
the Eanh and into space, 
however long it may take," says 
Steven.

Jolla , concerning a child needing 
a tutor. He looked into it , and 
soon it turned into a business. 
He figures that he'D be domg it 
for the rest of h is life. 

Steven reaDy enJoys his job. 
"It's a nice feeling ," he says. 
"Each person has something very 
unique inSIde , and if that an be 
brought out, in a pOSitive way, 
they can really give a lot to other 
people," Just recently, he has 
become involved with a State 
enate public Awareness 

Committee for the 
developmentally handIcapped , as 
pan of his commitment to what 
he terms, "the underdog." 

With the rest of his time , 
teven researches what he calls 

·· new religlOns." He has wriuen a 
few articles on the subject for 
foreign magazines, and he is 
currently working on his first 
book, Shopping for God. He has 
also given several lectures on 
new religions. He tries to take an 
objective standpOint , but he says 
it's hard . He hasn't seen 
anything magical; the religions 
he's researched claim such 
things exist, but he's never seen 
an y evidence that proves these 
allegations. 

Four and a half years ago, at a 
La Jolla coffee shop, Steven and 
his photographer, Scott Sothern 
gOt involved with new religions. 

'These twO people came 
walking in , like they were from 
Star Trek. They were dress ed in 
blue capes and tights, and they 
carried posters which pictured 
the Eanh and flymg saucers. 
"Scott asked , 'What planet are 
you guys from?' One of them 
said Orion , and the other said 
Venus, without blinking an eye." 

Steven and SCOtt chuckled as 
the twO people began to talk 
seriously about a "third world 
convocation of light." Steven 
received a poster, about an 
"interplanetary con ference 
celebra ting Earth's Joining the JJ 
planets from the fourth 
dimension ." 

teven was interested , so he 
looked into these people that 
caDed themselves the "U narius" 
group . They were founded in 
1852 in the south , and soon 
after, based themsleves in EI 
Cajon . People came from as far 
away as Canada to attend their 
conference, and it was clear that 
the group was pretty serious 
about their beliefs. 

An old woman named Uriel 
(an acronym for Universal 
Radiant Infinite Eternal Light) , 
the one in the picture above his 
couch, runs the group. In the 
picture, the painting on the waD 
behind her is supposed to be 
her home planet. 

According to Steven, her 
I=ivilization was attacked by the 

Isaac Newton . 
In Steven's words, she believes 

that " ... wc hcre o n Earth have 
heen corrupted by the Orionites, 
and the Space Brothers are 
coming to save us." The Space 
BrOthers are upposedly in 

Steven categorizes many new 
religions under the name 
"paganism." The people in these 
groups, which are organized into 
very small sects, tend 10 come 
from deprived backgrounds and 
are usually between the ages of 
40 and 45 . There are as many 
men as women , but few children , 
because the people in these

but are unable 10 land because 
there is 100 much "negative 
polarized energy." U riel believes 
that "positive thoughts will 
repolanze the tanh's energy, so 
the Space Brothers can land." 
Then, the Space Brothers are 
supposed to conven their 
spaceshi ps into great 
universities. 

Uriel and her followers are 
serious about their beliefs. They 

groups tend not to have families. 
Steven has met some of these "pa-
ganisrs" and he says that they are 
"basicaUy vety sweet people who 
are into very idiosyncratic religious 
beliefs." Many of them hold 
regular services, and the majority 
believe in ESP, UFOs and 
astro-projection (which has to do 
with the mind leaving the body). 

Steven thinks the movie Star 
Wars is somewhat responsible for 
all the new religious movements.

New religions are more 
accepted today than they were 
during earlier times. "Fort)' years 
ago, they would have been 
considered crackpQ{s by the 
majority of the population :' says 
Steven. He thinks that there has 
been a splintering of religIOUS 
beliefs since 1960, and now, 
religIOUS sects are more 
numerous than ever before .

I asked him what new 
religions had to do with 
counseling, and ho: said that they 
both deal with alienated people . 
He counsels people who aren't 
sure about sehool. a nd he studies 
people who aren't sure about 
society; both are trying to escape

The Tritons of '68: will 
gridiron glory return to UCSD? 
By GUS SANTOYO, Stllff Writer 

W HEN MOST people think of the late 1960's, several things 
come to mind - Viemam, 
drugs, the Olympics, the 
Beatles, Richard Nixon, 
The Graduate and the 
Flintstones to name a few. But in 
these pans, old timers will tell you 
that one other recollection of this 
time period is especially 
memorable - this was the era of 
the UCSD Football Team. 

It would have been great to 
hear the old timers reminisce 
about the tradition of Triton 
football: 

--"Remember Blanchard and 
Davis? Well, they would've been 
cut from that great Triton team 
of '68. 

--"We had one quanerback 
that made Dan Marino look like 
BiUy Kilmer." 

--"On our team, Dick Butkus 
would have been a smurf." 

Unfortunately the team never 
quite reached those glorious 
heights. The sad truth is that the 
team lasted one season, lost 
every game and had the 

faculry supponed such a move , 
having come from universities 
like UCLA and Michigan -
schools with strong football 
traditions. Ted Forbes, chair of 
the PE Department at the time, 
had been a football coach at UC 
Davis, and was intrigued by the 
idea of a team on campus. 
Forbes, along with support from 
students an faculry, preSented 
their their case to the chancellor 
and dean of student affairs. The 
decision was to approve the 
development of a football 
program at UCSD, but no 
scholarships were to be allowed. 
Fifty thousand dollars was 
allocated for funding of the team. 
Excitement spread through the 
university as visions of a football 
powerhouse , albeit at the small 
school level, became popular. 

Coaches began salivating 
when they heard that a head 
coach was needed to start a 
football program at UCSD. The 
general consensus among m'my 
coaches was that although UCSD 
was Just an infant in the football 
world , with big brothers like 

"No other sport can generate all that 
excitement, school spirit and unity." 

infamous distinction of losing to 
a Cal Tech team that hadn't won 
a game in five years. Although 
this team never made anyone 
forget about Notre Dame, a quitk 
look back on the rise and fall of 
the UCSD football team provides 
an interesting perspective on the 
benefitS and harsh realities of 
resurrecting another 
intercollegiate football team at 
UCSD. 

In the late '60s, some students 
expressed an interest in staning 
a team on campus. Many in the

UCLA and Cal (Berkeley), it was 
Just a mattter of time before the 
Rose Bowl committee would be 
knocking at the door. If one 
were to look at the Warren Field 
now - the place where all the 
games were then played - it's 
very hard to ever fathom the 
concept of Rose Bowl. 
Nevertheless, coaches from all 
over the contry were interviewed , 
Including Chuck Fairbanks -
who would later become head 
coach of the NFL's New England 
Patriots - all of them wanting 

the chance to develop this blue-
chip football prospect. The 
school chose Walt Hackett, 
defensive coordinator of the San 
Diego Chargers. Hackett chose a 
staff and although no full 
requirement of student athletes 
could take place because the 
program was just starting, a 
football team was assembled for 
the '68 season. 

The team proceeded to playa 
winless season, including the 
embarrassing loss to Cal Tech. 
Yet the team was enthusiastically 
supponed by the students. "It 
was exciting seeing all the 
students cheering at the games: 
said Ben Kobayashi , presently 
the Director of Recreation, who 
at the time was a graduate 
student and the timekeeper for 
the home games. "There were 
500 to 600 students in the 
Stands, which was a lot 
considering there were probably 
a thousand students at the 
schoo!." 

After the season ended, 
Hackett, his coaching staff and 
many of the players decided that 
the only way to improve the 
team was to provide scholarships 
to the players. The faculty 
dissented on this suggestion, so 
the issue was to be solved by 
student vote. The students voted 
down the referendum to provide 
the players with scholarships by 
a vote of 4 to 1. 

This is where the demise 
began. Hackett, seeing his "Rosy" 
dreams of a Division I program 
go kaput, fled to Pittsburgh to 
work for the Steelers under his 
old coach at San Diego, Chuck 
Noll. Many in the coaching staff 
left for other jobs while players 
began transferring to other 
schools. 

This abandonment of players 
and coaches struck a fatal blow 
to the football program. "We 
wanted to continue the program

Taller, quicker Tritons hope to raise 
ladies basketball to new heights 
By FUP HARRISON 

T HE TRITON womens' basketball team is more than enthusiastic about its 
upcoming season. Watching the 
women in practice, you get the 
feeling they all just finished 
reading l. Ron Hubard's 
Dyanfiics. If only Pee-Wee 
Herman had this much energy. 

Head coach Judy Malone is 
not one to hide her excitement, 
either. "I'm extremely excited 
about this year's group and I 
think we have a lot to look 
forward to," says Malone. 
Including seven returning 
players, a good group of recruits, 
and a taller. faster club, pre-
season enthusiasm may not be 
misplaced. 

With a 10-12 overall record -
7-4 in Division UI play last year 
- this year's Triton squad hopes 
to bener both marks. "This year 
we're going to be the best and 
well definitely be in the 
playoffs," predicts confident 
returning sophomore Counney 
Simpson. And this enthusiasm 
comes after a grueling 1W0-hour 
practice. Wow. 

Also returning are last year's 
third leading scorer and leading 
rebounder in seniors, Lynne 
Mclevie and Jennifer Gregory, 
respectively. Malone expects a lot 
from both , in addition to great 
productivity, "leadership, both on 
and off the court," says Malone. 

Coach Malone is also 
expecting excellent performances 
from third-year player Heidi 
Jungling; 6-foot-1 junior-college 
transfer Beth Coplan; prospective 
staning guard Sandy Keaton; 
and, freshman Shellie Velie, a 
member of laSt year's Colorado 
statt! champions. Thus, with the 
mixed group of improved 
veterans and incoming players, 
the team has improved in the 
areas of height, qukkness and 
athletic ability. 

Improvement in these areas 
will help create an overpowering 
defense which coach Malone 
anticipates will be the teams 
fone. She also expects a 
controlled fast break and 
aggressive rebounding to be 
amongst the squad's strengths. 
About the team's strategies, 

Malone says, "we are looking to 
dominate teams defensively and 
from good defensive play we 
hope to key our fast break." 

These and other strategies will 
be used to combat the variety of 
foes on the Triton's mixed 
schedule. Amongst the opposing 
teams are powerful clubs such as 
Northern Arizona and USD, as 
well as the less than fearsome 
teams of Point lorna and La 
Verne. The Tritons open their 
season at home on November 26 
against Azusa. 

Excited as she is about the 
new season, however, Malone 
offers no predictions as to how 
the team will fare against the 
opposition. She believes it is 
better to take one game at a 
time, although she does include 
amongst her goals an above .500 
record. Winning all its games 
hardly seems to be the teams 
primary goal, however. More 
important to the players, it 
seems, is that they enjoy 
themselves, sustain their 
enthusiasm and keep intact the 
club's "tight-knit" quality. ~ 

Senior Phil Kenney dribbles past an opponent. The Tritons are 18-1. 

Black Wednesday; UCSD 
loses at Claremont 
By AUCIA AGOS 

I T WAS a tough week for the UCSD men's soccer team. The Tritons were the proud 
owners of a 16-0 record 
when Wednesday rolled 
around and it came time 
to play Claremont. Bad 
things happen in Claremont, 
around Claremont, and when 
UCSD even thinks of Claremont. 
Yes, the winning streak was 
snapped , but with IWO victories 
since, the team has shown that 
the spirit is still willing. 

Claremont is synonomous with 
frustration . By all accounts , the 
Stags are no better taknt-wise 
than UCSD, but the Tritons have 
had much trouble breaking 
through the Claremont jinx, 
particularly at the Stags' home 
field . The 2-1 score was the 
first time this year that more 
than one goal per game has 
gotten past Goalie. A1bertto 
Gomez. Robert Paterson's goal 
keeps him at the head of the 
Tritons in goals scored, with his 
14th of the season. 

The Tritons chances were also 
dealt a severe blow when Scon 
Strom mer was ejected for 
throwing a punch at one of the 
Stag players. "It's tough enough 
to win up there with the sides 
even," coach Derek Armstrong 
said, "and when its 1I-lO and 
you're down that one man -
well, that's a bit much to 
overcome." 

Until that point, the Tritons 
had dominated Claremont after 
tying the match ten minutes into 
tqe game. UCSD took 17 shots 
on goal and limited the Mudd to 

nine at the final whisde. But the 
jinx seemed to be in full force. 
Joe Giaclone broke free on the 
right wing and passed the ball to 
John Wingate who scored from 
in front of the net. Unfortunately 
for the Tritons, the goal was 
nullified by an offsides and the 
teams went into the half still tied 
at one. The Tritons also had one 
shot hit the side bar and one hit 
the crossbar in the fi rst half. 

Josh Quinones scored the 
decisive goal with only 13 
minutes to go in the half after 
the Tritons had stifled Claremont 
for 20 minutes despite the man 
disadvantage. It was the first 
time an season that the Tritons 
had allowed more than one goal 
in any match. 

Despite the outcome, the 
Tritons and Claremont will meet 
again in the championship 
rounds - the only question 
remaining is where that match 
will be played. "Well, we didn't 
help ourselves any, " said 
Armstrong of the Triton's hosting 
chances, "and ['ve been tOld that 
the home field advantage doesn't 
necessarily hinge on the best 
record - whatever that means." 

The Tritons showed their 
metde twO days later when they 
got back to the basics and beat 
Division I USD 2-0 on Friday. 
"We played a vety committed, 
aggressive game. You could teU 
the lads Wclnted to redeem 
themselves and play a good 
game - the Claremont game 
really hun everyone," said the 
coach

for a second year," said Howard 
Hunt. chair of the PE 
Depanment who was the athletic 
director at the time, "but aU this 
disenchantment caused our 
program to come to a screeching 
halt. Another coach offered to 
continue the team, but by that 
time, there were not enough 
players to field a team, so we 
cancelled the program 
altogether. " 

So after the kssons learned 
with the football team in the late 
'60s, is there a possibility that 
UCSD could once again have a 
footbaU team? "There is always 
the possibility of having a 
football program again," said 
Hunt. "If there is enough student 
interest and if the students are 
willing to pay for it, we will 
support the football program. A 
variety of things are necessary, 
but student interest and support 
are essential to get this sort of 
thing off the ground ." 

One who would whole-
heartedly agree with Hunt is 
Mike Warren, head coach of the 
UC Santa Barbara football team. 
What started off as a friendly 
game between students, and then 
as a friendly game between the 
alumni, grew into a club team 
that plays a schedule comprised 
of schools from Divisions II and 
!II, and also semi-pro club teams. 
Although still considered a club 
team, the football program at 
UCSB is under the auspices of 
the Athletic Departmetn and 
hopes to become a full fledged 

intercollegiate program by next 
year. "The students were 
instrumental in starting the 
team ," said Warren, "Without 
their efforts, this team would not 
exist." 

UCSB Athletic Director Ken 
Droscher remains cautious about 
the football team going 
intercollegiate. "We are presently 

interest in the team has already 
been evidenced by the approval 
of a student referendum which 
provided funds of approximately 
$65,000 for the football program. 
Another major factor is that the 
program does not affect the 
funding of other sports. Yet 
Droscher remains optimistiC. 
"This was initiated entirely by 

of an sports," said Kobayashi , 
who will become the chair of the 
PE Department. "The equipment 
is very expensive; coaches 
demand salaries, travel costs 
become heavy and, on top of 
that, you still have to pay the 
officials. You need to have 
enough money so you don't take 
away funds from other sports. It 

Cheerleaders? What cheerleaders? 
> 

By ROBERT LEONE. Stllff Writer 

U CsD ONCE HAD a cheerleading squad, but tracing it through time is a difficult task. Few remember that there was a cheerleading squad, none seem to remember the names of the cheerleaders; but only twO short years ago, there they were. 
According to laurel Den , an assistant recreation supervisor, "We used to have one." Dean, who 

started working at UCsD three years ago, remembers that there was a cheerleading squad during 
her first twO years, but the cheerleaders seem to have faded away last year. The squad, which was 
organized as a recreation club, seems to have suffered the fate of many such clubs by failing to 
auract new members. Dean also mentioned that UCSD did not seem to respond well to the 
traditional cheerleader style. Also, the cheerleaders were handicapped because there was no pep 
band to play for them. Dean pointed out that this year UCSD does have a pep band, which will 
debut at the October 30 volleyball game against USIU. The Sun God mascot will also be present. 

Recreation program instructor Judy Malone was rather more blunt than Dean, saying that "They 
just kinda died ."Malone, who said that one of the problems with the cheerleaders was that they 
were very quiet, echoed Dean's statement that sports spectators didn't seem to respond to the 
cheerleaders. "We would like a bunch of rowdy people to lead cheers," said Malone, who then 
referred to the cheerleading on Oct. 19 of the men's basketball team, led by Greg Kaminsky, 
during the women's volleyball game. 

Malone mentioned that such less traditional. but enthusiastic cheerleading seems to rouse UCsD 
students more than more traditional cheerleaders. As an example, Malone mentioned the guys who 
sit in the bleachers and form their arms into U, C, 5 and D shapes while yelling a "U-C-S-D" 
cheer. 

However, neither Dean nor Malone predicted a resurgence of traditional cheerleading. ~ 

re-evaluating the football team

by the institution are met, then

spons. "If a program is not 
subsidized, you run into a 
number of problems," said Hunt, 
"look what happened to San 
Diego State . Their football team 
relies heavily on gate receipts 
and if they don't get a certain 
amount of people in the stadium, 
money is taken from other 
athletiC programs. 

Even if a football team doesn't 
become a Michigan or 
Oklahoma, most would agree that 
football is beneficial to a school. 
"No other sport can generate all 
that excitement, school spirit 
and unity. These benefits also 
slop over to other sports because 
people are more aWclre of the 
athletic programs," said 
Kobayashi . 

In the United States, football is 
the most glamorous and 
attractive spon a university can 
have. No other sport can lure 
105,000 people into Wolverine 
Stadium in Michigan evety week, 
for example. No other sport can 
make an Arkansas crowd of 
60,000 scream "Whoo, pig, 
sooie!" to inspire their "Hogs." 
No other spon can make a man 
trade in his house for tickets to 
the Texas-Oklahoma game. Now 
it's doubtful anyone will trade in 
his house for tickets to the 
UCSD-Biola. football game or that 
crowds will make Triton noises 
- whatever those may be - to 
inspire play on the gridiron. But 
a football team at UCSD could be 
the foundation for better school 
spirit and unity - something 
that could use improvement at 
UCSD. The key to football here 
is in the hands of the students. 
But a football team should be on 
campus for one more reason: to 
beat Cal Tech and avenge the 
reputation of the '68 Tritons. ~

Cyclists gear up 
for new season 

Weeldy Spons Calendar 

By ERICA GLENNON 

I F YOU think being a member of the UCSD qt:ling dub is as easy as riding a bike, 
perhaps you should stop 
in at the UCSD bike shop 
and have a few words 
with manager and cycling coach, 
Tom Colley. He'd be the first to 
let you know that c)ding is both 
phYSIcally and meraly 
demanding. Though the cycling 
season doesn 't officialy start 
until March. the Tri£Ons are 
already pedalling into vigorous 
workouts. 

Pre-season or winter training 
I sn't easy. The riders average one 
hundred miles per week , riding 
five Out of seve n days from seven 
am to nine am. Yet compared to 
the speed traInIng workouts that 
begm m January. Tom Colley 
call the workouts "fun _" 

"Speed tramIng is where 
people fInd out what they are 
made of It's when your body 
wants to quit J nd your brain sull 

wantS to go. It's bein,\!, able to 
push yourself a little farther. so 
that when you do stop it's 
because you want to, not your 
body," says Coley. During speed 
training, the mileage the team 
puts in doubles, and what was 
once a fun winter ride becomes 
an intense training session. In 
addition to riding, tlie team 
works out on weights bi-weekly. 
All this . plus an occasional 
training party, helps the Tritons 
prepare for tOugh competition 
including top teams like UC 
Santa Barbara and Stanford. 

Cycle racing competes on 
three different levels. The 
women's team competes in a 
separate class. and the men are 
divided into an expert and a 
novice class. Expert ncers are 
requIred to be licensed by the 
United States Cycling Federation . 
Expert riders also must be 
ranked as a number three nder. 
Riders are ranked on a scale 
from four to one, with the 
number one racers including

many nanonal team racers. 
Colley feels this will be a big 

year for the team. Last year's 
team finished fourth out of 22 
schools in California. In addition 

Ito their impressive overall fimsh . 
they received an overall 
indIVIdual expert win and an 
overall men's novice WIn. But 
where the team hopes to improve 
thIS year is in their women's com-
petition. Coach Colley is 'stilliook-
ing for a few good women" to add 
depth to his team. Triton nder 

Regatta 

Anne Kline returns to race for 
UCSD after spending some time 
in Italy and racing on a team 
there . She will be offering some 
coaching help in addition to 
being a promising rider. 

Freshman Doug Grose looks to 
be a significant rider for the 
men's team. Grose comes to the 
club with an already impressive 
record as he was ranked as a 
junior state racer. The Tritons get 
some extra coaching help from 
number one ranked rider Matt 

Pedro 

Newberry, 
The cyclers race a variety of 

distan ces. depending on what 
type of race they are involved in. 
Road racing averages from 40 to 
70 miles. criterions are between 
25 a nd 50 mles, time trials are 
generally 10 mile races. and track 
or velodrome races are generally 
3000-meter pursuits. The club 
races on a velodrome when they 
travel to Dominguez HtlIs.

All-Campus 
Tennis Tourney 
Results 
T HE ANNUAL UCSD Singles Tennis Tournament recently 
concluded with three eXCiting 
final matches at the Muir courts. 
It represented the climax to two 
full days of tennis, which saw 
the participation of over 100 
UCSD students staff and faculty 
members. 

The men's Open Divison saw 
Dave Souter emerge as a 6-2. 6-2 
winner over FranCOIS Monnar. 
Both players displayed 
impressive tennis skills 
throughout the champIonsh Ip, 
bur in the end Souter's patience 
and steadiness made the 
difference in the match . The 21-
year-old Junior relied on over six 
years of experience to 
systematically frustrate Monnar. 

Still, it seems like a bright future 
lies ahead for the IS-year-old 
Muir freshman from Pt. Lorna. . 
After only two years of playing 
the game. he seems intent on 
competing at the intercollegiate 
level, an ambition he seems 
likely to fulfill . 

In the Men 's Intermediate 
Division, Doug KadamOlo battled 
Stephan Matthaei for over 90 
minures before emerging with a 
6-3, 6-4 victory. Both players 
relied on steady baseline play in 
a final that was ultimately 
decided by a si ngle service break 
in each set. 

The women 's field , less 
numerous than the men 's draw, 
ended in a very competitive final 
between twO graduate slUdents. 
Julie Phillipson . a founh year 
medical student formerly ranked 
in the top 10 female juniors in 
Southern CalifornIa, used an 
impressive attacking style of 
game to beat Anne Schwanz.

Armstrong was pleased with 
the turnout for the La Verne 
game two weeks ago Wednesday. 
a game that he felt had to show 
that UCSD had the community 
support and playing conditions 
necessary to host a 
championship. "For a mid-week 
game, the turnout was 
marvelous: he said . "and the 
field was in excellent shape -
that won 't be a problem at aU ." 
Renovations on the field were 
made days before to lengthen the 
field to the same size as 
Claremont's. the Tritons' stiffest 
competition for hosting the 
games.

it, and now finishes up the 
season against Pomana-Pitzer 
before awaiting the news about 
the playoff sights. ·We should 
know by Wednesday. I imagine: 
said Armstrong, "because for 
organizational purposes you've 
got to have a little time to get 
things ready." 

But Armstrong admits that its 
difficult to stop thinking about 
the monkey on their backs 
named Claremont Mudd. "We're 
focusing our attention on the 
next Claremont game: the coach 
said. "We are very committed to 
beating them the next time ." The 
Tritons can now only wait and 
see whe,..e the next time will be . 
Rod Cramblit, who scored one of 
the goals in Saturday's game 
thinks that the Claremont loss 
"was a positive thing actually. It 
brought us together as a team. 
Well be ready to tear them apart 
in the playoffs." ~

years, pre-season was often spent
