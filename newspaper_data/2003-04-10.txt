Independent A. . presidential candidate Bryan 
Barton has been forbidden to continue any form of 
campaigning for the la t 1:\\0 days of the elections 
period. The decision made by the elections com-
miuee came as a result of a grievance brought 
agaillst Barton by Michael Zank, John Muir 

The A. . elections committee has ruled that all 
Smdents Firstl slate posters mu t be taken down by 
II :59 p.m. on April 9 after the commmee found the 
slate to have violated the election bylaws by provid-
ing materials to a student organization to make 
po ters th:lt served to ave spots for the la teo 

ollege representative to the elections committee, 
who accu ed Barton of handing our campaign flyers

Slate members were seen removing the posters 
during the late hours of April 9. Posters stating the 
endorsement of Students Fir t! candidates by the 
Asian Pacific-Islander tudent Alliance were subse-
quently hung at about midnight. Daniel Gonzales, 
who argued on behalf of the Students First slate 
during the grievance was seen hanging the APSA 
endor ement posters in the Student Center, and 
would not comment. 

The elections comminee report given on April 8 
found Barton guilty of campaigning in the class-
room, which is in diren violation of A.S. election 
bylaws.

Low turnout expected for elections 
Shelton cites uncontested races as reason 

By STEVEN win 
Staff Writer 

Voter turnout for the 2003 
A. . elections i predicted to fall 
short of last year's turnout due to 
a lack of student interest and a 
high number of ca ndidates run-
ning unopposed. 

"I am going to expect [voter 
turnout) unfortunately to be a 
little less than last year," said 
A.S. elections manager Robin 
Shelton. 

In last year's election, 4,750 
students, or 27 .6 percent of the 
tudent body, voted. TIllS was up 

from about 3,700 students, or 24 
percent, that turned Out for the 
200 I election. 

"Because we had the athletics 
referendum last year and ,III the 
commi sinners running unop-
posed thiS year, the interest to 
vote or the need to vote isn't as 
high as it wa last year," helton 
said . 

The 2002 election had an 
unusu~lIy high voter turnout, 
which many attributed to the 
athletic referendum that was on 
the ballot, which required 3,700 
tudents to vote in order for it to 

pa .. s. In addition, last year there 
was a largc number of highly 
contested po Ilions, which can-
not be said for thl year's elec-
lion.

te~ted races to seven out of a 
total of 12 .S. Council POSI -
tions. 

Despite a consistently low 
voter turnout and the high num-
ber of unopposed andidates this 
year, many students stili feel a 
desire to come out and vote. 

"I feel that it is Illlportant to 
leave the chool in good hands," 
said senior adeem Rajani , 
while at the ame time expre~s ­
ing his dis,lppointillent in the 
low number of conte ted r. ce~ . 
"I like the referendum where 
they have a certain mount of 
po itions be elected by the coun-
ci l Itself. I think that It'S a good 

idea. It's IU t kind of worthies to 
have all thiS clutter around cam-
pus, wa ting money for people 
that aren't even going to be 
opposed." 

Rajani was referring to a ref-
erendum on thl~ year's ballot, 
which, if pa sed, would change 
the A.S. commissioner from 
elected to A.S. ouncil -appoint-
ed posi tions.

UC pitches contract to 
clerical workers' union 

Proposed wage increase 
falls short of C.U.E. hopes 

By CiAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

The University of California 
has approved a propo ed settle-
ment with the Coalition of 
Univer ity Employees that would 
include raising wage of UC cleri-
cal workers by 2.5 percent. The 
union will decide this month 
whether to accept or reject the pro-
posed agreement. 

C.U.E., which represents over 
18,000 clerical workers from the 
nine UC campuses, had originally 
asked for a 15 percent increa e in 
wages. 

The union will be a king its 
members to vote this month on 
whether or nm to accept this pro-
po al; if accepted, the new contract 
will take effect immediately and 
end in September 2004. If C.U.E. 
mcmbers decide not to accept it, 
however, both partie will re ume 
bargaining and will have to decide 
whether or not to declare an 
impa se. 

"The truth is the propo al has-
n't changed one penny from the 

original propo al two years ago, so 
we expect our member to take a 
pretty harsh look at it," said 
statewide president of C. U.E . 
Claudia Horning. "It only amounts 
to average about $1 .30 a day per 
employee, with which they can get 
maybe a cup of coffee." 

The Univer ity of California, 
which has not yet made details of 
the proposal public, will give 
C.U.E. until April 30 to corne to a 
decision . 

"We want to give the union and 
UC employees plenty of time to 
discuss the proposal amongst 
themselves," said spoke man 
Paul chwarrz. 

According to ally Hampton, 
president of C.U.E.'s an Diego 
chapter and book re torer at 
Gei el Library, accepnng this con-
tract Will not signify the end of 

confllct~ between the Ulllvcr~ lry

Independent Kevin Hsu acquitted of grievance 
Elections committee upholds legitimacy of candidate's statement 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. elections committee 
recently decided in favor of inde-
pendent presidential candidate 
Kevin IIsu in the grievance filed 
against him by Vice President 
Finance candidate Harish 
Nandagopal. 

andagopal filed the grievance 
claiming that Hsu falsified infor-
lnation in his candidate statement. 
Hsu's candidate statement declared 
that his past experiences include 
chairman of the H.E.AR. cam-
paign, chairman of the "No on 
CRE 0" campaign, A.S. vice 
president internal and Warren 
freshman and sophomore senator. 
Nandagopal said that I !sus infor-
mation misled voters and therefore 
violates an election bylaw stating 
that candidates may not falsify 
information "on Election 

Candidacy forms or campaign 
materials." 

According to the written deci-
sion by the elections committee, 
Hsu did not violate any bylaws. 
Hsu's qualifications listed in his 
candidate statements were posi-
tions created by the StudentS Firstl 
club. The club is registered in the 
S.O.L.O. office and has a 
Can titution which states that the 
president and conmlander-in-chief 
can create any position he or she 
desires. Hsu's po itions, cteated by 
the club's president and com man-
der-in-chief Phil Pali oul, are then 
valid under the Constitution. 

"We're enthralled that the 
committee made the correct deci-
sion, strictly adhering to the elec-
tion bylaws," said Palisoul, Hsu's 
campaign manager and spokesper-
on. 

However, the committee did 
acknowledge Nandagopal' claims, 

saying that Il su's use of eleclion 
bylaws served to "mock the process 
that selects student leaders" on 
campus. Even though the elections 
committee has recogni7.ed that 
Hsu's statementS might mislead 
students, the bylaws do not include 
specific rules against ambiguous 
credentials. 

"1 disagree with the decision," 
Nandagopal said. "I just feel that 
the committee really disempow-
ered themselves with it. r sti ll 
respect the committee, but r JUSt 
don'l agree with their decision." 

The committee points out that 
the case shows its limitations and 
how it must only adhere to what 
the bylaws state. According to the 
committee's written decision, itS 
obligation is to the bylaws and not 
to its member own moral views. 

"We are dismayed that our 
opponents tried to get us disquali-
fied through legal means as 

opposed to letting voters decide," 
Palisoul said. 

Jeff Le, the A.S. representative 
for the committee, wrote a dissent-
ing opinion. According to Lcs dis-
sent, Hsu should be disqualified 
due to his "ulterior motives and 
spiteful ethics" displayed in his 
campaign. Additionally, he stated 
that Hsu's statement to "Vote for 
the REAL Kevin I Isu" implies that 
presidential candidate Kevin 
hawn Hsu is false. Le also points 

Out that the similar qualifications 
of the two Kevin Hsu's only serves 
to confuse voters. 

Le wri tes tha t the case is an 
example of how the elections com-
mittee should be able to go further 
than the text of the bylaws and 
"make a stand again t utmost 
shadiness and questionable 
moti'/es and morality." Le also sug-

Posters: Students First! slate charged; Unity acquitted 
conrinued from page I 

Action Parking Wave Slate slate 
protested the replacement of stu-
dent organization posters by 
Students First! and Unity po ters 
at the very opening of campaign 
season on March 30. The ruling 
did not include any penalties for 
the Unity Slate. 

Students First! will lose 2 days 
of poster usage, after the slate's 
candidate for Commissioner of 
Programming Rishi Shah admit-
ted that materials used to make 
the K DT posters that held the 
hanging spots for Students First! 
were donated by the slate. 

"Once the material is givcn to 

an A.S. enterprise/service, it 
becomcs the property of that 
enterprise/service," States the text 
of the decision. "The elections 
committee feel that this action 
constitutes a violation of Article 
V Section B umber 1 j, which 
states: 'It shall be a violation of 
the Election Bylaws for any can-
didate and/or slate to use 
ASUC D offices, services, enter-
prISes or equipment including 
computer, paints, stationery 
andlor logo for avocation of a 
candidate or slate at any time. '" 

The club holding poster spots 
for the Unity slate, 703 
Producti ns, was nor shown to 

have given material benefit to the 
slate during the April 4 hearing. 

"The elections committee 
strongly feels that the actions of 
'saving spaces' are against the 
intent of the bylaws and the elec-
tion," the elections committee 
said in their resolution. "But there 
is no bylaw that is clearly in 
breach of the action." 

Uiga, the petitioner, was ome-
what satisfied \vith the outcome. 

"I thought if you broke the 
bylaws, you were kicked out," Uiga 
said. "I'm happy as long as the issue 
is being add res ed. Its nor what the 
elections should be all about." 

Jeremy Paul ,allagher, the

presidential candidate for the 
Unity slate, said that he did not 
expect any action against his slate 
because of this electoral grievance. 

"I hope this will set forth ome 
sort of precedent that no other 
slate will do this again," 
Gallagher said. 

Gallagher admitted that his 
slate's action played a role in the 
poster-switching tactics that he 
considers a problem. 

"We had a lot of reservation 
and hesitation," Gallagher said. 
"We didn't want to do it but we felt 
we had to ... to compete."

albeit small " advantage in the elec-
tions. 

The committee's findings also 
argued that Barton, who has filed a 
police report against Zank for theft, 
had not tried to retrieve the flyer in 
class, and that the exchange of the 
flyer was "not as much as a taking as it 
was a giving." 

"1f Mr. Barton felt that it \vas taken 
or stolen, it is reasonable to believe that 
the respondent would have made some 
anempt, verbal or otherwise, to retrieve 
it at the time," the report tated. 

UCSD police are not following the 
charges against Zank criminally and 
have instead referred the case to a stu-
dent conduct coordinator, according 
to detective Douglas O'Dell . 

Barton said that he would cam-
paign until his \Vednesday 11 :59 p.m. 
deadline. 

"I'm going to try to get my mes-
sage out as much as I possibly can, and 
on Thursday and Friday I'll just be 
trying to get people to get out the 
vote," Barton said . "And for the con-
cern of the people, I'll encourage 
them to vote for parking-friendly can-
didates." 

ccording to Barton, he is also 
looking into appealing the decision 
and "impeaching every single member 
of the committee for political crony-
ism," with the exception of elections 
manager Robin helton. 

The report also found Barton's 
claims of the proceedings being taint-

Election bylaws 
need reform to 

prevent postergate 
Thjs year's election season has been 

marred by allegations and charges of foul 
play and unfair campaigning. With all of 
this going on, it is good to Know that A.S. 
elections manager Robin helton has done 
a great job in applrin~ the rules and issu-
ing fair judgments for mfractions based on 
the election bylaws. However, the 
Guardian would like to see the bylaws 
amended to outlaw the practice of saving 
space fO.r posters before the campaign sea-
son begInS. 

As far as this year's infractions are con-
cerned, Shelton has been fair in his punish-
ments. For A.S. presidential candidate 
Bryan. Ba~on, who broke ?ylaws by cam-
pa!gnmg In class, not allowrng him to cam-
paIgn past Wednesday was a fitting punish-
ment. 

It would have been extreme to disqual-
ify him, but it al a sent a clear message to 
current and future candidates that not 
following the bylaws is a punishable 
offense. 

We also agree with helton's take on 
the /frievance filed against the tudent 
First. slate. In this ca e, by supplying 
KSDT with suppHe to make posters that 
saved space for the Students First! slate, 
the slate wa essentially campaigning 
before the elections began. 

For this, the punishment of not being 
able to ~ave posters up after Wednesday is 
also fittIng. It would not have been fair to 
disqualify an entire slate, nor would it 
have been fair to cut all campaigning that 
that slate could do. 

While this year's rul es were enforced 
faithfully, they do n~t add ress the prob-
lem that poster- avJO~ pre ents. This 
practice i not onl y agaInst the nature of 
the election bylaws, which eek to foster a 
com petiti e spI rit, but can al 0 hurt indi-
vidua l c~n.dldates. n?t running on a slate. 
By coal ItIOn-buddIng before elections 

~egin"to "find candidates to fill slate posi-
tIons, slate can make contact with tu-
dent organizations that could save space 
for the slates' po!>ter before the cam-
paigning period commences. 

If an independent candidate 
approached a student organization to save 

spa~e ror him, or even POH posters him-
self, that would easily - and correctly -
be c~>n trued as campaigning before the 
e l e~tlOn ea on got underway. 

Shelton and the re t of the c1ectiom 
commi.ttee ha~e done a great job in en forc-
lI1g thl year s bylaws, but the Guardian 
would like to see llext year's bylaws amend-
ed to add~e the problem of space-saving 
for campaIgn posters. 

This will onl), serve to improve the tone 
of next year's elections, and give all c:lOdl-
dates an equal shot at A.S . office.

What a difference a year makes. 
Last April , I was shooting the breeze in 
fifth-period physics with hris, who 
sat next to me, both of US second-
semester high school seniors impatient 
to graduate. This April, I'm in the rel-
ative safery of college while he fights 
with the Army in Iraq. I heard of this 
news during spring break, and Chris 
isn 't the only one - at least three other 
young men from my high school are 
stationed in Iraq as part of their mili -
tary semce.

And even if dis ent is harming

no chance we can lose this conflict;

Indian sovereignty has limits 
All parties must be equal before law 

Iy JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Supreme Court heard 
arguments on a landmark case in 
Indian tribal overeignty in the 
United States on March 31 . The 
ruling will seck to draw the line as 
to how much authority state offi -
cials have on tribal property. A 
ruling 011 the matter is not expect-
ed until April or May. 

The issue at stake is whether 
or not states have the authority to 
serve search warrant on Indian 
reservations. The Ninth ircuit 
Court of Appeals, in siding with 
the tribes, ruled that a 1953 act of 
Congress gave states jurisdiction 
on Amcrican Indian land with 
respect to individual tribal mem-
bers, but not tribal governments. 
Because Lndian casino are a tribal 
enterprise, the judge ruled that it 
was immune to local warrants, 
searches and seizures. What the 
court failed to realize in their 
opinion was that this grants the 
tribes too much power. 

The current case before the 
Supreme Court is a perfect exam-
ple of how the appellate court'S 
deCision could give the tribes too 
much power. Inyo County sheriA's 
investigatcd three tribal members 
in 1999 who were u pected of 
welfare fraud for collecting bene-
fits whi le working at the tribe's 
Paiute Palace casino in Bishop, 
Calif. The county got a search 
warrant for the employee' pay 
records, but the eri be refused to 
hand them over. The district 
attorney obtained a search warrant 
in 2000 and seized the record hy 
force after the tri be refused to 
honor the search warrant. When 
the county tried to serve another 
warrant thrce months later, the 
tribe filed sui t in court. 

By allowing the tribes to balk at 
official warrants and not cooperate 

, 

-.... ~---

NATIONAL 
with state investigators. the Court 
gives the tribes freedom that goes 
beyond what the 1953 decision 
intended. It could very easily turn 
into a situation where a fugitive 
could seek refuge on tribal land. If 
a murder suspect were to book a 
room at a tribal hotel/casino, then, 
under the appellate court's ruling, 
the tribe would be well within its 
right to not allow authorities to 
search rooms for the fugitive. 

Tribal upporters argue that the 
tribe has an interest in maintaining 
the peace and would not allow 
criminals to be harbored. But that 
argument depends entirely on the 
costs and benefits of every siulation 
- far too subjective and fluid to 
constirute a long-term policy. 

How would tribal supporters 
react to a tribal member who mur-
dered someone out ide of the 
reservation for raping his daugh-
ter? The tribe might have an 
interest in not seeing this man go 
to jail for a crime of passion. He 
may even be an important tribal 
elder. The tribe could easily har-
bor that man in a tribal enterprise, 
such as a hotel or casino. While 
the law does give state authorities 
the right to prosecute individual 
members of tribes, the ruling has 

explicitly said that warrants cannot 
be served on tribal enterprises. 

In other words, the police 
could arrest a tribal suspect if he 
were at his home on the reserva-
tion or walking around it, but they 
could not enter a casino or hotel 
on a reservation without tribal 
consent. Again, if it werc in the 
lIibc's interest not to consent, then 
tribal enterprises could rurn into 
safe havens for criminal activity. 

Ultimately, this is an issue of 
sovereignty. Tqe question is 
whether American Indians should 
be allowed to fully govern thcm-
selves on their own land and be 
treated a5 a separate government, 
or whether they are subordinate 
to state law. 

While proponents of tribal 
sovereignty maintain that tribes 
should be dealt with like other 
governments, the fact remains that 
they are not [ike other govern-
ments. These are sovereign states 
that were established by a govern-
ment loolang to atone for one of 
the biggest thefts in history. 

The purpose of sovereignty 
was to allow the American Indians 
to maintain their way of life. That 
included keeping tribal laws and 
allowing enterprises like casinos 
to generate capital for the tribal 
governments. Somewhere along 
that line, the sovereignry was 
taken too far. 

As of the latest appellate court 
ruling, the power of tribes was 
expanded to being able to block 
investigations of crilJ1Jnals at the 
discretion of the tribe and allow-
ing corporate America to profit 
off of the sovereignry of the tribes 
(Harrah's casino in orth County 
is a perfect example of what can 
happen). These power are no 
longer being used to protect a way 
of life, but to assert power on sur-
rounding people that must abide 
by state law. 

OPINION S 

A.S. eledions a far cry 
from democratic 

Slates not the solution to 
creating an even election 
horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

Regime change starts at home. Well, most unforru-nately for the srudents of 
UCSD, the happy event that is 
regime change happens every year, 
and with each successive A.S. 
Council election, regime change 
looks less and less like democracy 
and more and more like a three-
ring circus. 

Even without multiple Kevin 
Hsu's running, reading the election 
news stories of a certain non-A.S. 
funded publication sounds like 
farce more apt for a certain Muir-
based quarterly. 

All right, take away all of the 
candidates espousing free parking, 
and the election looks more serious 
- except for the fact that nine 
positions are uncontested, and 
more are effectively so after the cir-
cu - like elements of t11e ballot are 
removed. It is patently absurd to 
call a system a democracy when all 
the srudents have is one choice. 

After sitting in on interviews 
with nearly every candidat~ for 
campus-wide positions last year, it 
wa.s a disappoinonent to this writer 
that by and large, the morc incom-
petent candidates were chosen due 
to their association with the 
Srudents First! slate. Regardless of 
the mechanies of how candidates 
ended up on a slate, why certain 
slates sweep elections or the validi -
ty of slates as free speech and asso-
ciation, the effects are clear and 
chilling: competent srudents with 

good ideas are not running hecause 
they know they stand no chance of 
winning, and thus even their con-
tributions of healthy discour e are 
lost. 

[f banning slates is iIIcgal under 
the protection of free associa tion, 
then there must be some mcans to 
reorganize the system such that 
minoriry voices stand a decent 
chance of bcing represented in a 
suitable number of oftlccs on the 
A.S. CouncIl. Pcrhaps subjecting 
slate members to proportional rcp-
resentaoon across all their offices is 
one olution . 

And in pite of the ham that the 
election process has become, the 
AS Council sti ll dares to ruminate 
about financial autonomy. 
Furthermore, the performance of 
the srudent government in the past 
four years is atrocious in nearly 
every other arena. Several failed fee 
referendums show that the "govern-
ing eltte" has lost sight of what the 
srudent body wants and needs (i.e. J 
no-frills expansion WIthout 80 J 
quarter worth of pork barrehng). 

The external office has spent all 
the last three yea rs leadi ng other 
campuses in state and nationwide 
movements for various idealistic 
issues about access to education, 
but has done little for UCSD rela-
tions with the San Diego commu-
nity. The academic affairs office, 
under the utter incompetence of 
slate-elected Halle Beitollahi , has 
managed to leave students voiceless 
on the issues that matter the most 
to them (passing periods, curricu-
lum, admissions, etc.) by not filling 
tudcnt appointments on fdculty 

committees, the one place where

Professors must be impartial regardless of politics 
Administration obliged to keep classroom fair for both sides 

By DUSTIN FRELICH 
Staff Writer 

\ Ve have gone to war, but how 
Profe~sor Ro alyn Kahn of CitruS 
College used her classroom a a tool 
to advance her leftist agenda prior to 
President Bush's deci ion Illay shock 
some readers - then again, maybe 
not. Kahn, an adjtU1ct professor at 
the California school, assigned to 
her students the extra credit task of 
writing letters to President Bush, 
weighing 111 on the then potential 
war with Iraq. The only problem 
was that he made it explicitly clear 
that letter Illust only be fJgnmSl a 
pos ible war; no letters upporting 
the war would be gtven credit. 

Extra credit assignments such as 
these have a sort of tradition in the 
Speech 106 course taught by 
Professor Kahn, a required course 
for srudents wishing to lIansfcr to a 
California State Univcrslty hool. 
In another uniform-thought exper-
iment, Kahil madc it clear that 
credit would only be givcn to Slll-

dent~ that c pre sed the unportJnce 
of adjunct faculty II hen writing to 
Cahforllla Legl ~lJlOr Jack SCOlt. 

Ilowcvcr, cracking down on 
univerSIty absurdilles \eClm r.He. 
In recent memory, we at U .SD 
had Ihe QlIlI1ty Troul)C ,c'llldal, 
where the admini tratlOiI 's unwill -
ingness to fire Professor -Iroupe 
l)ccdu c of appllcJtion fudgmg for -
tunJtcly cnded m hIS resignation. 

But if you're looking for aCtlOIl, 
the emu College case need~ a ht-
tic outSide pres.ure - a little 

F.I.R.E., so to speak - (0 warm the 
administration's bchillds. 

The Foundation for Inthvidual 
RIghts in ' ducation, a watchdog 
gr up dedica ted to a ademic free-
dom IIJ higher ed ucation, has 
responded to the ca ll of duty to pro-
tect chsscnting smdcnts in Kahn's 
class and to cnsure her actions do 
not go unpunished. Before thei r 
Joming, KalUl would havc received 
only a slap on the wri t, followed by 
a recital of the ever-popular JI1antra, 
"I'll nevcr do it again," and pushed 
on her mcrry little way to "teach" in 
more discrect ways. 

According [0 U nited Press 
International, Samuel Lec, the 
associate dcan for Language Arts 
and Forcign Language at itrus 
College, has said that the school 
dId attempt something along these 
lines to remedy the iruation. An,1 
if remedying the siruation means 
doing nOthing, they were wcll on 
their wa}' to wrapping it up! 

EI.R .E.. jOllled the fight against 
Professor Kahn after being 
approached by a student In Knhn'~ 
~peech cia,s. Chri Stevens contact-
cd Ef.R.E .• Ibout the qllc~tionJble 

cla ~s aeUVllIes and furthcr charged 
the professor WIth devoting "the 

fir~t 10 1Illl1utes of every c1J~ ... to 
her politica l agenda," reported 711( 
Cbrolllcit of IlIghrr EdIlCIlIlOII . 
F.I.R.E., armed with Mr. Stevel1s' 
II1formatlon, notified the admtnt -
trators and arc now pushing for :I 
more ~atisfacLOry condu~lon to the 
cpi,ode in thought ontrol. And the 
colleg definitely needed ome 

STATE 
nudging in the right direction . 

Aftcr being cont:lcted by EI.R.E., 
Louis E. Zeller, pre~ident and 
superintendent of itrUS ollege, 
wrote a lctter conceding the charges 
brought against K:rhn by her sru-
dents as true, and aid that the col-
lege would "sanction Profcs or 
KaJu1 in an appropriate maimer." 

"Professor Kahn gave srudent 
an extra crcdit assignmcnt to writc a 
letter to President George W. Bush 
protesting the possible war with 
Iraq." Zeller wrote . "Students 
were clear in thcir understandmg 
that they would only receive credit 
J.f they wrote 'prote,t' lett ers. 
Students were told that thme who 
wrote letters cxpre'~tng alternate 
views (including support for thc 
war) would not receIve crctllt." 

[t seems El.R.E. ~ quest is tart -
mg to pay off. B ~lck whcn the tory 
brol.e in early March, a slap on the 
WrISt would be all Kahil would 

receive from the admim tration . 
But as time surely rolls on, so docs 
justice. Kahn is now on administra-
tive leave from Citrus College. And 
with F.I.R.E. chasing her, we can be 
sure she does not do her smdents 
the intellectual injustice of creating 
a uniform class code of thought at 
Citrus, or any other institution of 
higher learning. 

Rosalyn Kahn still doesn 't get It, 
however. With the allcgatlons 
affirmed by both EI.R.E. and the 
president of the school, among 
others, she called the accu ations 
"untrue" and still sees her elf as 
innocent. In what can only be 
described as childish spin, Kahn 
crie "wol r." one more ti me. 

Forcing others to falsely espouse 
beliefs they do not hold is inconsi -
tCnt wi th my practices a an instruc-
tor," she said. "I would not, and did 
not, penalize tudel\ts who expressed 
Vlew contrary to my own." 

Possibly she 's trying to parse 
words. Indeed. the assignments 
were extra credit, therefore she can 
be said to have not pmoll':.td sru-
dents with di senting oplllions, but 
rather rtwurdtd those with accept -
able o nes. However, Profes or 
Kahn's problem I~ much bIgger 
th.m a ~i rnpl e parsi ng of word~, It IS 
one of whether she WIshes to obey 
the merica n SOClatlon of 

J1lVer i ty Profc sors Jcatienllc

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

War: Troops must be brought home 
continued from page 4 

simple truth is rarely pure and 
never simple," and our troops 
must see this everyday. It is not 
our duty or our right, as American 
civilians, to dictate what they 
should be thinking while on the 
front line, or that their morale 
hould autOmatically be high 

because the purpose for this war is 
fuzzy at beSt, but no fuzzier than 
in the minds of the soldiers on the 
front line . 

\Mth the true motive of this 
war more than a little hazy -
everyone in America has a di ffer -
ent opinion of why, exactly, we're 
doing this, and every ingle media 
source has di fferent report a to 
what 's tran plring - peculation 
is rampant. The media spews 
forth differing accounts of what 's 
happening with blatant contra-
dicoons and wide pread retrac-
tions. 

Take the case of J ess ica 

Lynch, the V. . Army supply 
clerk who was taken prisoner 
March 23 and rescued April I. 
Conflicting reports came from 
the As ociated Press regarding 
the number and nature of the 
injuries she u tained while 
imprjsoned - was she shot? 
Stabbed? Starved? Forced to 
watch the executions of other 
members of her unit? 

American newspapers are 
understl\ndably eager to play up 
the alleged mistreatment of V. . 
prisoner of war when it remains 
to be seen whether any mistreat-
ment is occurring at all. According 
to the Associated Pres, her father 
denied, for example, that she was 
released with gun hot and stab 
wounds after American newspa-
pers reporred that she had sus-
tained such wound . 

Sadly, as illustrated by this 
case, the real truth about what IS 
going on in Iraq will only corne 

when our troops come back 
because they are the true eyes and 
ears of this conflict - not our 
chummy embedded reporters, not 
our smug TV news talking heads 
and certainly no government 
cheerleaders like Donal d 
Rumsfeld, all of which are simply 
in the business of making the war 
seem, at once, dramatic and suc-
cessful. 

Our mission is clear: our 
troops must be brought home 
expeditiously for only when they 
are safely home, can we discern 
the true nature of this war; our 
troops are the only one who are 
in any position at all to extract any 
truth from this conRict and to 
provide insight intO why, rea lly, 
we are pouring human lives and 
billions of dollars into tlle physical 
destruction of Iraq. Thus, in the 
name of truth, justice and peace, 
bring our boys - and girls -

Irish protests growing 
increasingly violent 

Pint perspective provides 
a new look at patriotism 
though~ 
over a pint 

Chris Taylor 

A s the war passes a fortnight in length, much of the atti-tude in Europe has 
changed. The majority of Europe 
is still staunchly against the war, 
but also has rejected much of the 
anti-American sentiment roused by 
the extremist . Meanwhile, the 
extremists, who now are back in 
their previous category of fringe 
groups, have become desperate for 
the attention they held for several 
weeks. The protests and acts of 
civil disobedience have become 
increasingly violent, anti-American 
and initiated by the usual suspect 
of European protests: mostly stu-
dents and radical left wing organi-
zations. 

For example, instead of the rep-
etitious and woefully tired anti-
Bush slogans, French protesters 
have taken to desecrating a British 
cemetery with many ignorant and 
despicable slogans, one demanding 
the British dig up their filth, "It's 
polluting our soil." Never lnind the 
thousands of British soldiers that 
died so that these radical students 
could speak French instead of 
German - they're mad now, 
damlnit! 

Of cour e, France is the 
Western world's epicenter of every-
thing opposed to American policy. 
This SOrt of action is not terribly 
surpris1l1g. Germany has main -
tained much of iL~ dignity through-
out the laSt months and if anyone, 
will emerge a the heroes of the 
anti-war movement over France 
and Belgium. However, the 
German fringe groups still push 
furth er into absurdity. 

Several doctor have posted 
signs refusing the treatment of any 
Americans, Briti h or nationals of 
any country upporting the war. 
There ha been increa ing suppOrt 
for complete boyconing of 
American imports. In their self-
righteous indignation, the boy-
cotters have forgotten lhat it will 
be Germans who will lose their 
jobs because it is they who run the 
American companies' factones 111 

ermany. 
Ireland i no exception. Though 

protests have decreased significant-

Iy, the Gardai are more often seen 
in riot gear. Usually unarmed, 
these approachable law enforce-
ment agents are now often een 
carrying large rifles. Even the 
politicians have become desperate. 
Humorously mi sguided Labour 
foreign policy spokesperson 
Michael Higgins, who wrote that 
the V.S . foreign policy wa "hate-
filled," was dragged away by 
Gardai when he. refused to allow 
another enator into the Dail. 

Most of these new incidents and 
polls are completely logical and 
expected . Protests have declined 
because the anti-war moderates 
and the politically unaffiliated have 
already voiced their opinion and 
saw it rejected. As \vith any organi-
zation vau lted to sudden limelight 
only to have it stripped away with-
in weeks, fringe groups have had to 
re orr to hock tactics and increas-
ingly violent rhetoric to spike the 
interest of the masses, who have 
largely become contented to 
denounce the United States but 
still hope for their wift victory. 

However, Ireland has shown a 
very interesting trcnd in the la t 
few weeks. A now-infamous poll 
conducted by the Sunday 
Independent showed that, as 
expected, over 70 percent of the 
Irish public did not Uust Pre idem 
Bush. Also, as expected, 63 percent 
were opposed to the war in gener-
al. However, the unexpected result 
was with regard to the u e of 
Shannon airport as a refueling base 
for the V.S. military headed for the 
Middle East. The country was split 
nearl y in half ovcr whether 
Taoiseach Berrie Ahern was correct 
in allowing the .. to use the air-
POrt de pite the con ~ t1tut1onally 
protected Irish neutrality. 

This has been A tonny tOpiC 
over the last IX months. 1any pro-
testers were not e\'en as angry 0 
much about .S. disregard for i~ 

. . opponents, but rather that 
their government \Va allow1l1g 
V.S. war planes to refuel in their 
country, which they argue was a 
breach of neutrality. 

ow, the country ha explici tly 
voiced Its opposition to the war and 
to Bush, but is largel y divided on 
whether their neutrality was 
breached. In fact, there are several 
prominent anti -war commentator 
who vehemently argue for tlle ., 
use of Shannon airport.

THURSDAY, APRIL 10,2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Finding yourself a good 
reason to go to colJege 

Editor: 
I share imilar sentiments with 

Jessica Lingel's features piece 
"Wait, I thought we were all in col-
lege to learn'" (April 7,2003). I am 
surrounded by students who are 
here for two reasons, either ro 
obtain monetary prosperity (using 
education as a venue to getting rich) 
or to anain GPA superiority (educa-
tion as a means to getting the A). 

I seldom hear students striving 
to learn knowledge for knowledge 
sake, or even for the advancement 
of knowledge. I also rarely hear SUI-
dents wanting to share or discus 
the wealth of knowledge, rather 
di cussing what monetary wealth 
their future job will get them or 
that they need an A in the cia s to 
get into medical or a graduate 
school. I las the value of education 
been reduced to two numbers, the 
amount of money on a paycheck. 
and GPA? I sure hope nor. 

However, I must disagree with 
you on students using college as a 
medium for becoming "better 
acquainted with themselves." The 
whole reason I came to a university 
of this magnitude was because of the 
choices of disciplines. Some of us 
know e)(acdy what we want to do 
with our liv~, yet others of us do 
not. We are expected ro pick one 
major, develop and acquire skills and 
knowledge for that major, and make 
a career out of that particular major. 
I t is frowned upon if we do not uti-
lize the degree of which we obtained. 

I for one do nor believe in 
restricting myself to one major nor 
one area of study. Higher education 
offers individuals the flexibility, 
tools and ule venue to evaluate and 
think critically, regardless of disci-
pline. It is up ro the person to take 
that opportuniry. 

Viewing college primarily as a 
means for "developing interests 

you already have" is JUSt as shallow 
as using college as a venue for mon-
etary or GPA gain. It is like saying, 
"I only like Thai cuisine, so I can-
not eat anything else." Why l10t 
sample other foods? Why not peek 
into other disciplines? To be trite, 
college open a multiulde of doors. 
Why not develop intcrests you do 
not already have? You never know, 
it may turn into a keen interest.

Endorsements, coverage 
of Hsus were lacking 

Editor: 
I'm writing this letter as a con-

cerned UCSD student in regards to 
the recent coverage given to the 
A.S . elections process. 1 believe the 
Guardian to be a greatly respected 
and circulated newspaper among 
the sUldents and staff of the UCSD 
campus and was thus all the more 
disappointed to read the content of 
your election coverage to this point. 

In regards to your endorsements, 
I completely re peet your choices, as 
everyone has their individual prefer-
ences, but I do nor agree \vith the 
way in which the candidates were 
deSCribed. Your presidential 
endorsement was one with which I 
had a disagreement, even 3S I under-
stand that it is your choice as the staff 
members of the newspaper to choo e 
whom you see fit. However, in 
describing the other candidates, 
there was a lack of thorough clarifi-
cation which disturbed me. The 
work and extensive experience of 
Kevin Shawn Hsu was dismissed as 
though it was insignificant to the 
position for which he was running. 
You have chosen to withhold 
endorsements from those candidates 
without enough experience, and yet 
you choose to write off the know-
how of a truly qualified candidate as 
inconsequential. If your readers base 

their votes solely on the candidate 
statements and your reporting, they 
will fi nd little-to-no differential 
between Kevin Shawn Hsu and 
Kevin Hsu; yet only the most mini-
mal amount of coverage has been 
allocated to expose these most press-
ing and crucial differences. 

Ln addition, the entire episode 
involving the independently running 
Kevin Hsu has not been clearly 
exposed to your readers. Kevin I Isu, 
a candidate whose supporters have 
admitted that his supposed positions 
were created all in one night, is 
wholly unqualified for any po irion 
in Associated Students, much less 
the office of president. I Iowever, 
your coverage of the elections makes 
him appear as a potential equal to 
Kevin Shawn Hsu. Absolutely noth-
ing Kevin IIsu has done during the 
campaign has been admirable or 
amusing, and r believe something of 
more consequence than what has 
been covered should be wri rten for 
the benefit of informing the readers 
of your newspaper before they vote 
in the elections. To state that "his 
[Kevin I-Isus) candidacy is not to be 
taken seriously" is absolutely ludi-
crous as the confusion hi place on 
the ballot will create will undoubted-
ly mi lead orne supporters of the 
Kevin Shawn Hsu to vote incorrect-
ly. Kevin I Isu is being played as a 
puppet whose sole purpose is to cre-
ate confusion amongst the upport-
ers of Kevin Shawn Hsu. 

Politics is certainly expected to 
involve some ugly aspects, but the 
attempts of some individuals to 
split the votes of Kevin Shawn Hsu 
by finding a pawn with the ame 
name to run against him are atro-
cious. The gross mani pulation of 
the election bylaws by the support-
ers of Kevin Hsu should be exposed 
as JUSt that - a manipulation of the 
students of UCSD.

Pint: Public incensed by current events

is so divided means that the public 
must be giving the situation a lot of 
thought, especially considering 
how many are so fi rmly against the 
war. It is a large boost for Irish 
thought proce s independent of 
left-wing rhetoric tha t saturates the 
streets. 

Ireland is quite economically 
dependent on U.S. business. The 
large majority of Ireland's recent 
pro perity i due, if not to 
American tourism, to American 
inve tmen!. Taoi each Ahern said a 
drastic move to eliminate the use of 
Shannon to U.S. military, which 
has been availa ble since the first 
.ulf War, would not only be cen 

as a hostile sanction-e que move, It 
would also decimate the economy 
of the airport itself. Ireland has 
used many different word to 
oppose the U.S. military interven-
tion, but Ireland is also clearly 
looking Ollt for its best interests by 
continuing the trend of economic 
success fueled by American invc t-
menl. 

For once, many people are lis-
tening to logic rather than sound 
bites. The left-wing parties, 
Labour, Green and Sinn Fein, have 
made fiery attaclts on the Taoiseach 
about the imJllorality of his actions, 
but are often ignored. In fa t, mo t 
of the opposition to Shannon' usc 
is due not to the morality of the 
war, but fueled by the desire to 
repair the devastated EU common 

foreign policy. This is exacerbated 
by the intriguing fact that the rotat-
ing presidency of the EU is slated 
to be fi lled next by Lreland who will 
have a prime opportunity to be 
considered the uniting country of a 
divided Europe. 

This evidence of public opinion 
spawned of intelligence rather than 
emotion is unexpected considering 
the number of Irish politicians and 

" In fact, most of the 
opposition to Shannon's 

use is due not to the 
morality of the war, but 
fueled by the desire to 

repair the devastated EU 
common foreign policy. " 
public speakers with less than 
rema rkable intellectual platform 
and opinions. Numerous V .. mil-
itary strategists and low-level 
diplomats have recently been 
hown that their mediocre debating 

skills are stel lar again t many lri h 
journalists. 

Last week, Newt Gingrich 
dominated an Irish TV interview 
with an anti -war journali t as she 

embarrassingly read from a script 
with a painfully obvious plan of 
attack. The British editor of The 
Economist calmly dismantled the 
arguments of two visibly furious 
Irish anti-war professors and the 
frusrrated mediator, who was 
forced to take sides with the pro-
fessors because they b.:gan resort-
ing to vague allusions to Irish 
domestic problem and name-call-
ing. 

Despite the sad state of mallY of 
Lrcland' commentators, the recent 
polls have given immense credibili-
ty to the intelligence and decision -
making skills of the average lrish 
citizen. The rational rea ons for 
both oppo ition and support actu-
ally serves to make the majority of 
Ireland's political elite appear silly. 
It also suips naked the obvious and 
simple-minded rhetoric by the 
fringe groups. Regardless of the 
outcome of public opinion, which 
will be shown largely through the 
length of time that Bertie Ahern 
stays in office, the majority of 
Ireland' citizens have uccessfully 
shown the distinction between 
politically re pectable anti-war 
advocates and the anti-American 
scourge that everyone ha been 
talking about but few have been 
able to pinpoint.

O lympic bronze medal -win -
ning snow boarder hri s K1ug vis-
ited the Price Center on April 8 to 
promote organ dona ti on to the 
UCS D community. 

KJug appeared as part of lhe 
event to share hIS experience as 
an orga n transplan t recipient. 
Three yea r ago, he received a 
11\ er transplant, wh ic h beca me 
necessary when his cond ition of 
Primary chlerosing C ho langi tis 
worsened. Less than six months 
after the transplant, Klug won a 
World Cup race ill Italy, and JUSt 
18 month after the transplant he 
won the bronze medal in the 
Olympic alpine snowboard com-
petition at the Salt Lake City 
Olympics. 

According to Klug, organ 
donation allowed him to regain hi 
life and spend time with his family. 
He said it has given him a new 
lease on life and he has since made 
it his goal to share with others the 
necessity of organ donation.KJug 
travels through the nacon speak-
ing at different events, including a 
conference with President George 
W. Bush, in order to spread the 
message of donation. 

The April 8 visit is one of the 
first such events on the West 
Coast and the very fir t at UC D , 

Tyler Huff/Guardian 
Donor dudes: Bronze medal-winning O1ris K1ug (right) talks to Eleanor Roosevelt 
College lunior Justin Chen (left) and event organizer Alex Quick (center). 
according to Donor Dudes orga-
nizer Alex Quick. This is the first 
year of Donor Dudes, which was 
formed to promote awareness in 
the UCSD community of the need 
for organ, tissue , marrow and 
blood donations. They hope to 
have many more such eventS 
because the group feels this is an 
important message to get out to 
people. 

According to statistics provid-
ed by Lifesharing Community 

Organ and Tissue, more than 
80,000 men, women and children 
are curtently waiting for organ 
donation in the nation. 

Last year, about 22,000 trans-
plants were performed, but this 
falls short of those in need and so 
about 17 people a day die waiting 
for organs. T he organs and tis-
sues that are needed and can be 
donated include : heart, kidneys, 
lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, 
corneas, skin, tendons, bone, 

heart valves and veins. The dona -
tions made by one person can 
save the lives of more than 50 
people, promoters said . 

The event included booths 
from Lifesharing Communit), 

rgan and Tissue D onation, the 
National Kidncy Foundation and 
the Blood Bank: all of which work 
to increase aware ncss about bo th 
living and non-living donatio n. 
Lifesharing offered snldents the 
chance to fill out donor cards and 
receive a pink sticker to pl:tce on 
their driver license , which indi -
cates willingness to donate. KlUg 
traded signanlres for the place-
ment of the pink dOts. 

"It is so simple and it seems like 
the right thing to do," said student 

ick Thaler about signing up as 
he received his pink dot to put on 
his driver's license. 

However, all groups involved 
stressed the need to not only have 
the sticker, but a lso to speak to 
family and friends so that they are 
aware of thi wish. Without this 
knowledge, a family member 
could refuse to donate when con-
sulted after the death. 

Students had various reasons 
for signing the donation cards, but 
all agreed that it was a good effort 
to support.

WIth fewer srudents, t11e Regents 
were denying ~ruden ts access to the

"I think there', been a lot of anti-
war protests in San FranCISCO, so 
that wouldn 't be a logica l leap," 
Kl said. "I wo uldn 't cormect it to 
t11e war. I think [the Regents) have 
been fru rl y clear about it bemg to 
get less srudents that mi ght disrupt 
the meeting." 

The relocati on is just one other 
war-re lated con Ideration the

ll1c management and buslIlcss 
structure changes t11at occurred at 
the Los Al amo ational

meeting. Eighteen posJlions at the 
labs have been terminated, along 
with employees screened for theft 
and misuse of funds. The number of 
1000di vendor agreements has been 
reduced from 35 to 17, and investi-

SurveIllance of delivery si tes, called 
"drop si tes," ensures that laboratory

THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2003 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Regents: Concerns over fee increase voiced 
continued from page 8 

advance of Oct. I to provide for an 
orde rly transition between 
President Atkinson and his succes-
sor," 

The Committee on Finance also 
presented a budget update. T he 
r)resentarion emphasized that the 
university should not expect 
increased federal or private funds to 
solve the state's budget cuts, due to 
the state of the economy and the 
stock market. 

The budget crisis is occurring in 
a period of rapid enrollment 
growth . The general campus 
enrollment rate is expected to 
increase by 17.6 percent in the 
2003-04 year, while at the same 
rime, the state budget is expected to 
decrease by 5.6 percent. 
Suggestions to cut enrollment fig-

• 't[l , ~ .. , I 

ures were discussed, such as a plan 
that would enable students to 
attend an agreed-upon UC campus 
after first attending a community 
college. 

"The problem of restricting 
enrollment is that we made a 
promise to the state to enroll the 
top 12.5 percent of high school stu-
dents," Atkinson said. Atkinson also 
expressed concerns over the loss of 
diversity in entering classes if 
enrollment rates were decreased. 

An increase in student fees is 
part of the university\; solution to 
addressing the budget cuts. The 
Regents have already approved an 
increase of $405 in undergraduatc 
srudent fees , and $13 5 of this 
amOlUlt was implemented starting 
this quarter. This would raise fees 
by $1,200 over 18 months, or by 35 

percent. Although financial aid will 
also increase accordingly, the 
Regents voiced concerns at the 
meeting about helping needy mid-
dle-income students. 

In a speech presented to the 
Regents at the meeting, Klass 
stressed that students are sensitive 
to the changes in the costs of edu-
cation. According to Klass, current-
ly over 50 percent of students use 
loans to pay for their education, and. 
nearly 60 percent work at a part-
time job. 

"We are making unprecedented 
UC and higher education budget 
cuts ... and we need to think about 
things like raising fees and halting 
salary increa es," Klass said. 

A further presentation of the 
budget will be presented at the next 
general Regents meeting in May.

C.U.E.: Several local union 
leaders critical of UC offer 

continued from page 8 
by the Public Employee Relations 
Board, union-led protests on UC 
campuses and fin ally state-medi -
ated negotiations between the two 
parties. 

The San Diego C.U .E. chapter 
had joined forces with other local 
unions on Feb. 27 to march in 
protes t down Library Walk. 

According to !lampton, e.U.E. 
membership has been growing in 
San Diego. 

"What the un iverSIty doesn 't 
seem to reali ze is that every 
month since this has been going 
on, we've been gain ing in mem-
bership ," IIampton said . "Our 
coalition has just now sta rted 
working together this yea r and 
becoming stronger." 

The union, which currently rep-
re ents over 18,000 UC clerical 
employees, has been urging new 

members to join in time for the vote. 
According to Hampton , the 

over 12 percent diffe rence in the 
wage increase asked for by e.U.E. 
and the one agreed 0 11 by the uni -
versity came as no surprise. 

"[U C] President [Richard CJ 
Atkin on needs to s tart taking 
under consideration that he has 
singl e parents worktng here for 
$28,000 a yea r. T hey arc eligible 
fo r federal hou ~ ing assIsta nce. 
Some of them are even eligIble fo r 
food stamps," I Tampto n said. 

If C.U.E. members deCIde not 
to approve the contract , I lornmg 
said that she believes that UC offi-
cials would li kely decla re an 
impasse, and that the next few 
months wo uld be spent in fact-
finding, with pOSSIble outcomes 
including the university offering 
the union their last best option o r 
e.U. E. going into strikes. 

Turnout: Unopposed races 
may deter turnout 

contmued from page I 
not to vote in the A.S . elections. 

"I don 't really care. I am not 
very involved in the school ," said 
junior Karina Amezcua. Amezcua 
expressed th e sentiments of many 
students who do not feel affected 
one way or the other in regard to 
the outcome of the election . 

Such student apathy toward 
the election is the main focus of 
one A.S . presidential cand idate. 

"If I am nOt e lected, I don't

'Anger Management' had potential 
Despite a great cast, Sandler's new film is still a letdown 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

"A nger Management" is cer-
tainly a film with five-star 
potential. Ca ring a film 

that has Adam andler and Jack 
I icholson (both hot off of the 
awards show circuits) already 
signed on [0 play the leads proves a 
simple task. A film of thi stature 
can command cameo from Roger 
Clemens and Derek Jeter to 
Heather Graham and Rudolph 
Giulrani . Maris:! Tomei, \\foody 
I larrelson, John Turrurro and Lws 
Guzman round out the acting cast 
of a film that finds andler deallllg 
,dth an anger problem that seem-
ingly doesn't exist. 

After a few accidental anger 
incidents, andler finds Ilimself at a 
court hearing "~th an inept anor-
ney (Ke'~n ;-.1ealon). Unable to 
convlllcc the court that he is the 
nice guy that the audience already 
knows he is, andler finds himself 
in the hands of either a genius or a 
madman, or maybe a little of both. 

The film's biggest disappoint-
ment may ha"e been that its big 
name stars, both coming off career 
performances III "Punch-Drunk 
Love" and "About chmidt," cre-
ated expectations that freshman 
screenwriter David Dorfman 's 
script couldn't live up to. \ \'lrile 
both actors took their roles to the 
creative limit, they couldn't avoid 
taking step backward from the 
brilliance of their recent projects.

Nice guy: Adam Sandler IS an obVIOUS nice guy who's forced to take anger 
management therapy from a mad genius played by Jack Nicholson. 

Film 
REVIEW 

Sandler's character seems to be 
some hodgepodge of hi role 111 
"Punchdrunk Love" and, to some 
degree, the same "Billy Madison" 
character that he plays in almost 
every other film. He plays a quiet 
and sane indi~dual who eventually 
goes the way of a more traditional 
Sandler character \lith the help of a 
little anger therapy. \"hile this nUx 
olillds like it nught be uccessful, it 

puts andler nght 111 the rruddle of 

a specoum where he finds success 
on both extremes. The middle 
ground leaves him feeling like the 
generic romantic comedy male, 
trading in the hysterical perfor-
mances he ha previously offered 
for smaller chuckles and an ' , list 
actress (fomei) to play opposite 
him. 

While the depth of icholson's 
character was linuted in his perfor-
mance, good old Jack was able to 
bring a crucial pinch of brilliance to 
a character who has to switch back 
and forth between being friend and 
foe to Sandler throughout the film.

Neil Jordan proves to be 
'Good Thief' with remake 
This update of a classic has everything for 

an enjoyable movie-going time 
By CLINTON HAYCRAfT 

Contributing writer 

"T he Good Thief," a remake 
of Jean-Pierre Mel~lIe's 
1955 "Bob Le Flal11beur," 

is the story of Bob Monagnet 
ick olte), a veteran 

gambler/junkie on a losing streak 
in icc, France. He saves the life 
of a detective, Roger (Tcheky 
Karyo), who unsuccessfully and 
blunderingly chases him through-
out the film, and meets Anne 
(Nutsa Kukhianidze), a sexy 17-
year-old prostitute/junkie, whom 
Bob takes in to save from her 
lifestyle. An old colleague of Bob's, 
Raoul (Gerard Darmon), propose 
a massive casino heist in Monte 
Carlo, and in hopes of changing 
his luck, Bob detoxe off junk by 
handcuffing himself to the bed for 
three days because, as he later 
decrees, "gambling and dope don't 
nux." 

The plan has two aspects -
one, to be leaked to authorities by 
a "Judas" from the heist crew, in 
which they are to steal priceless 
works of art from an elaborate 
casino vault, and the other, to be 
secretly executed, in which they 
steal money from the casino afe. 
Paulo (Said Taghmaoui), Bob's 
errand boy, complicates thing 
with hi feelings for Anne, who is 
getting drugs from Said (Ouassini 
Embarek), a shifty, informant and 
dealer. 

The elaborate web of colorful 
characters acting according to their 
own mouves is exactly what Bob 
counts on in his big gamble. 

Nolte shines brighter than ever 
in this role, aided especially by his 

Film 
REVIEW 

on-screen chemistry with both 
Karyo, the quirky cop, and 
Kukhianidze, tile seductive damsel 
in distress . olte makes the char-
acter of Bob strangely loveable 111 
his demise. Bob docs not make any 
promises to reform after this caper 
or pretend to not love the Ii festyle 
of the big gamble. 

He loves to tell the story of hiS 
succe sful bet on a bullfight with 
Pablo Picasso, whom he looks up 
to as the grea test thief ever, steal-
ing from other ~rtists to achieve 
his signature style of cubism. Bob 
sees gambling as an art, and the 
connection to art is made even 
clearer by Chris Menges' stylistic 
freeze-frame camera work and pic-
turesque depi tion of the Monte 
Carlo landscape. 

eil Jordan's remake of "The 
Good Thier' is an all-around 
enjoyable movie-going expericnce 
with a great soundtrack, including 
Leonard Cohen and Bono. Its only 
drawback is its modern relevance 
since it eems only a great escape, 
but that is why we go to the 
movies after all.

Music t~kes on new importance 
during times of turmoil 

In times of war, music becomes vehicle for ideas and 
the Internet is a new way to disseminate them 

don't pop 
my sheep 

Clayton Worfolk 

Dissent has always been one of the key ingredients in the melting pot that is rock 'n' roll, so it comes as no surprise 
that during times of war - particularly dur-
ing times of such a questionable and popular-
ly contested war - rock has that much more 
meaning. 

From Bob Dylan to the Beatles, the Clash 
to Public Enemy, protest music has helped 
define countless armed conflicts over the last 
four decades, and thanks to a slew of artists 
contributing new music to the public dis-
course on the current war, it's poised to do 
the 'arne this year. What's more, artists this 
time around are, for the first time, using the 
Internet to distribute their llIusicalmcssages, 
even in the midst of warume censorship. 

In the months preceding the Coalition 
invasion of Iraq, and in these early weeks of 
the Bush administration's 

" 

witl1 the internet-only release of "The Final 
Straw." "We had to send something out there 
now," writes R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe 
on the band's Web page 
(bup:llunuw.rembq.com), and despite the 
track' rough studio mix, you can easily hear 
the urgency in his voice. 

R&B songstress Meshell Ndegeocello roo 
has recently dropped a topically themed 
track on her Web site 
(bup:II7JJ7JIW.mesbtll.cum). dcgeocello wrote 
"Forgiveness & Love," a funky, reggae-
tinged piece immediately following Sept. II, 
but chose to release it only weeks ago in 
response to the "present worldwide mobi -
lization for peace." 

Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day is the 
latest to tap the internet's mass distribution 
potential, posting a solo acoustic rendition of 
" Life During Wartime," a song written by 
his side band, Pinhead Gunpowder. 
Prese nted on the band's home page 
(http://www.grttndlly.com) "in protest of the 
war," the song features Armstrong's trade-
mark snot and sounds a bit familiar, but it 
gets the point across. 

Singer/songwriter Stephan Smith

else in contemporary rock.

Bragg croons in the "The Price of Oil," a 
low and somber acoustic number available 

on Bragg's Web itc 
(hrrp:llwww. b'/lybragg. co. 11K). 

American roots rocker John Mellencamp 
followed in March '~lh the release of "To

Beasties ' early day of three M s and one DJ 
(minus the politics), is me band's first release 
in years and will be featured on their upcom-
ing 2004 album. 

Former Rage Against the Machine lyricist 
2ach de la Rocha and turntablist OJ Shadow 
recently posted a sllnilarly-themed track on 
htfp:II7JJ7JIW.morcbofdrlllb.com, a ite dedicated 
exclusively to their newest collaboration of

THURSDAY, APRIL 10,2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 15 

The joys of Taste of Uptown/Hillcrest 
30 delectable delights in one lovely and food-tacular afternoon 
By llNALDO DORMAN 

Hiatus Editor 

It is almost inevitable; you arc tryi ng to decide where to eat and end up frozen ei ther by 
your unfamilia ri ty with the 
restaurants or the si mple lack of 
knowledge of wh at there is to 
cat. What if you're m the mood 
for pizza or T hai ? Where can 
you go? If only there were some 
way to sample several of the 
restaurants in an area in a conve-
nient and inexpensive manor. To 
your rescue is the Taste of 
Uptown/Hillcre t, which offers 
over 30 different restaurants, 
specialty coffee shops and this 
year, a beer garden sponsored by 
Green Flash Brewery. 

Of the many restaurants, there 
arc several well known eateries, 
such as Corvette Diner, Bronx 
Pizza, Whole Foods, Chipotle, La 
Salsa, Pizza Nova, Ben & Jerrys, 
Cold Stone Creamery, Baja Fresh 
and Jamba Juice, but these are just 
a teaser. 

The registration area is next to 
the beer garden, where you can 
sample two delights of hops and 
fermentation : the rich ruby red 
and the crisp extra pale ale. 

This self guided walking tour 
of Hillcrest's restaurants begins 
with the exquisite Hash House A 
Go-Go, mown for their fabulous 
breakfasts. The Hash House 
serves as a fitting start for such a 
delicious romp through Uptown. 

Among the many other tastes 
to sample are diverse selections 
of fare ranging from the simple 
to the artistic, and from the-
hearty to the delicate. 

Tyler Huff/Guordion 
Paved with food: Visit Hillcrest on April 12 to try out a huge selection of food 
including Thai, sushi, plua, Indian, ice cream and much more. 

Hamburger Mary's is known for 
their lively atmosphere, delec-
table traditional burgers and 
drinks. Kemo Sabe fean1l'es fiery 
and exciting modern food, which 
matches taste with presentation 
for a unique and amazing din-
ning experience. For authentic 
Indian, find your way to the 
Bombay Exotic, which has a fine 
smattering of curries, nan and 
many other Indian dishes . For 
Thai, there is the triple threat of 
Taste of Thai , Celadon Royalty 
Thai and Lotus Thai Cuisine, 
and a three-peat of Ono Sushi , 
Sushi Ino and Nami Sushi . If you 
feel like moving on to something 
more of the dessert persuasion, 
there is Finest Donuts and 
Bakery to satiate your sweet 
tooth. 

There is, in short, too much 
food to be written about ade-
quately; rather then continue to 
torture my own taste buds, let us 
say that you had better bring 
your appetite and your curiosity 
to Hillcrest. 

Parking is located on 5th 
Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue; 
from there you can take the free 
shuttle to different locations 
throughout the Hillcrest neighbor-
hood. For more information and 
tickets call (619) 233-5008, or you 
can purchase directly from several 
of the participating restaurants. 
Prices are StS in advance and S20 
the day of, but remember, sales are 
limited. The event takes place April 
12 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Don't 
miss this opporrunity to eat to your 
stomach's content-

icholson was well-cast for the role

the job done, but fails to deliver the 
fireworks most would expect out of 
such a monumental pairing. 

At its heart, «Anger 
Management" could have been 
more than the average romantic 
comedy, and maybe even more 
than the traditional Sandler come-
dy, but the overt presentation of 
what was a brilliant subtext during 
the film's finale turned masterpiece 
into, well , just a pieee_ While the 

film does a good job of combining 
geniuses of two separate genera-

more than a few laughs. "Anger

more than anything, for bringing

The excess of the eight-min ute-
plus opener "Big Picture," which 
ends in abruptly cut-off cathartic 
moaning, might deter the uninitiat-
ed listener. A closer listen reveals 
more tightly constructed pop songs 
such as the dark but upbeat "Lover 
I Don't Have to Love" and indie 
poppish "Bowl of Oranges." He 
still tries to pack a surprise even 
when burdened by structure, such 
as the self-aware instrumental 
break when he sings "mistake" on 
the waltzy "False Advertising," 
which will make you laugh, grate 
on your nerves, or both. Oberst's 
songs are full of self-deprecating 

humor, and occasionally, they are 
also inspirational. A line like "Love 
is real! it's not just in long-distance 
commercials" is at once hilarious, 
heartbreaking and painfully real 
when rendered by Oberst and his 
capable backing band. conci~d /rom page '3 

"Have You Forgotten" and "I Raq

country charts of late. But person-

What I find really disturbing, 
however, is corporate radio and

wartime music, pro and against, 
alike. Clear Channel

our local FM 94.9'5 a.d campaigns, 
has recently denied allegations 
that since Sept. II .it has urged 
programmers to curb political 
songs from station playlists. 
Furthermore, MTV Europe 
issued an internal memo last 
month recommending the censor-
ship of videos containing "sensi-
tive material," according to a 
recent Nrw York Timtr article. 
Videos blocked reportedly range 
from System of a Down's afore-
mentioned "Boom l " to anything 
by retro-poppers the B-52s. 

Obviously something is wrong 
with this picture. 

There is no more important a 
time for ideas to be exchanged 
than during times of war, and 
artists have long been among SOCI-
ety's most expressive voices in this 
regard. While the protest music 
during these first weeks of war 
probably won't surpass that of the 
oft-invoked '60s in terms of time-
lessness, it just might usher in a 
new era of political song. After all , 
even if the message falls on deaf 
ears, protest music sure roclcs. 

It is a mown fact that people 
cry at Bright Eyes shows. Fans 
have all the dedication of 
Dashboard Confessional fans with-
out the annoying campfire sing-a-
longs. Maybe it's because Oberst 
takes himself so seriously, saying 
things in interviews like "It almost 
hurts to love things because they 
have to stop being that." What) 
No matter. Bright Eyes is indelibly 
effecting, so bring your tissue 
when Bright Eyes visit the Scene 
on April 12.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2003 

An infusion of flavor at RIMAe Arena 
MASt\s annual dance competition produces great results 

By nM SPULECKI 
Contributing Writer 

On April 6, RIMAC Arena hosted the fourth annual Fusion, a hip-hop dance 
competition. If you simply walked 
up to RIMAe, the lines to get in 
rivaled that of Fall Fest and 
WinterFest, and the entertain-
ment was just as good. Two 
UC D organizations, MASA and 
220 (pronounced Second To 
None), once again put on the 
show in order to "present the uni-
versal appeal of hip-hop dance," 
plus demonstrate the influence of 
the music on the Asian-American 
communiry. Clubs represented 
this year's Fusion from both 

orthern and Southern 
California, all to the delight of the 
hundreds in attendance. In total, 
there were 13 performances, each 
with about 10 mjnutes of intricate 
choreography, with 15 to 25 
dancers all on stage at one point or 
another. 

The Californja colleges were 
well represented as UCSD, 
Stanford, CSU Long Beach, UC 
Riverside, CSU Fresno, UC Irvine 
and UCLA were all in attendance 
to showcase their best dance pro-
ductions for the past year. Some 
were strictly dance, while other's 
seemed to tell a story, which 
included dancers acting along to 
the words played over the speakers. 
It seemed like every set had a justin 
Timberlake song played, but the 
varied dance approaches eased the 
feelings of being wimess to a bro-
ken record. 

The highlight of the entire 
night involved an exhjbition per-
formance with minjmal dancing, 
at best. Clean-up Crew, which is 
best described 3 the Blue l3n 
Group without the blue paint, got 
early and frequent praise from the 
crowd as they beat away on metal 
and pia tic trash bins, construc-
tion signs and empry soup cans. 
Their unmatched crowd interac-
tion was also a plus, as each took a 
trash can lid and played in uni on 
with one another as they traversed 
the noor. 

Another organization that 
stOod out from the rest was the 

an Diego-based Formality. A 
young dancer, who looked like he 
was barely in middle school, front-
ed the all-male team. 'vVhenever he 
got up to perform part of the et, 
he got the loudest cheers of the 
night , yet he remained incredibly 
focused , staying with the rest of 
the much older dancers step for 
step. 

Of the 13 acts, eight competed 
for first-, second- and third-place 
trophies. A panel of fi ve Judge , all 
of who had extensive background 
In the performing arts, scored 
them. KABA Irvine wok the top 
pm.e of the night, while Team 
Millenia Fullerton and FormalJry 
San Diego took hOlne econd and 
third places, respecLively. It was 
nice to see, however, that teams 
who didn't place as high, were very 
respectful of those who won, and 
the same could be said for the win-
ners. They all recognized the hard 
work each person put In, and the 
great results that the whole show 
produced. 

Jes~ Hol1on/Guor60n 
Dedialted dJncers: Top: The dancers from f>:I5 (which stands for Across 
Between Stylez) put a lot of effort Into a strenuous dance routme. 
Middle: The dancers from 909, shown above, are lost In the moment. 
Bottom: Team Millenia from Cal State Fullerton put on a great performance and 
took home second pnze for I~ whICh they shared with formality from San Diego.

The Blood 
Brothers 

Burn Piano Island. Burn 
Artist Direct Records 

****1 
"Do you remember 

us?" shouts co-front man 
Johnny Whitney, opening 
the Blood Brothers' third 
full -length album, 811n! 
Piano Islond, BU17I . By the 
chaotic blast of guitar and 
drums, infused with an 
immediate vocal assault, 
it's safe to say that the 
unique style of the Blood 
Brothers is something 
impossible to forget. 

The band, hailing from 
Seattle, consists of five 
members. Mark Ganjadhar 
plays drums, Mcrrgan 
Henderson plays ba sand 
keyboard, Cody VOtolalo 
plays guitar and Whitney 
shares the spotlight with 
vocalist jordan Billie. 
'vVhile Ganjadhar and 
Ilenderson create low, 

polyrhythmic foundations 
for every track, Votolato 
controls the melodies with 
blisteringly high metallic 
guitar parts, laced with 
soft, crisp distortion and a 
wide range of other effects. 
llowever, the band is dri-
ven by the hyperactive 
dueling vocalists, each 
packing both energy and 
spirit. 

'vVhimey's high, snotty 
voice is effectively foiled 
by Billie's low-end sass and 
murderous scream. The 
difference in voice not only 
changes the dynamic of the 
music's presenta tion, but 
helps extenuate every 
change In every lme 
throughout the record. 
The dueling vocal pattern 
facilitates tracks like" USA 
Nails," detailing continu-
ing exchange between an 
operator and a prisoner. 

Throughout the album, 
the lyrics seem to address 
the unplea ant aspects of 
sociery through obscure, 
stream-of-consciousness 
metaphorical statements. 

Burn PiaTUJ IsImuJ, Burn 
has itall - musical mastery, 
lyrical genius and terrific 
album art. The Blood 
Brothers redefine the hard-
core mind with this release. 
Its a must-own album for 
any fan of music.

Gus Bla(k 
Uncivil ized love 

Immergent Records 

**** 
Gus Black is a breath of 

fresh air in a stale, suffocat-
ing industry. Today's pop 
music producers are 
scrambling to become 
more "authentic," as they 
flood the sound waves with 
the likes of Michelle 
Branch and John Mayer, 
while quietly shelving 
Brimey Spears and those 
Backstreet Boys. Gus 
Black's album Uncivilized 
Love, however, strides into 
this circus of second-rate 
talent and first-rate greed 
to show the public what it 
has been missing for so 
many years. 

With a voice reminis-
cent of the likes of Cat 

tevens and hjs contempo-
raries, Black's rich, husk')' 
vocal lend a nostalgic and 
authentic feel to his 
album. 

• 

reviews 
In addition to the 

potent blend of his ardent 
voice and strong acoustic 
guitar, Black incorporates 
drums, maracas, even elec-
tric guitar. The artist fol -
lows his own advice that he 
sings in the econd track of 
his album; you must "be 
who you wanna be." With 
the introduction of an 
eclectic and varied range of 
musical surprises in this 
album, Black creates a 
truly unique and innova-
tive sound. 

At times equally sooth-
ing and intense, Black pos-
sesses a deep enough 
understanding of his craft 
that experimentation with-
in his music is refreshing 
rather than cliched. 
Additionally, Uncivilized 
Love epitomizes risk itself, 
with tracks embracing folk, 
blues and even jazz roots, 
rather than limiting itself 
to one genre of (pop) 
music. 

The lyrics contained 
within Black's soaring 
vocals and potent 
melodies add to the twist 
that makes his music so 
refreshing. Black takes the 
unspoken need to be a 
depend a ble singer and 
embraces it, something 
that has been missing 
from music for far too 
long.

Ms. Jade might be the 

first mainstream female 
rapper to not try and sell

instead wants you to judge 
her on what she is saying. 
The Philadelphia native

embraces her style as if 
she's been flowing for just 
as long as the more estab-

her track, "Step Up," and 
won't be making any

best in the business, by 
making each track sound 
fresh and different from 
anything we've heard 
before. Her club song, 
"Ching, Ching," featuring 
Nelly Furtado, is catchy, 
and Furtado has found a 
niche III the Timbabnd-
produced, hip-hop genre. 
In other songs, jade tackl es 
th e issuc of a deadbeat 
boyfriend and frustrations 
she's gone through while 
growing up. Jay-Z, Nate 
Dogg and Missy Elliot arc 
a few big-name stars that 
show up on different tracks 
throughout the album as 
well. 

The worst track, as 
weird as it sounds, is "The 
Come Up," produced by 
the Neptunes. The beats 
seem like a rerun of an old 
Neptunes track, and every 
two seconds throu~hout 
the track, Pharrell 
Williams gives an annoy-
ing exhale, making you 
stop listening to Jade, 
instead wondering if 
Pharrell is hyperventilat-
ing. Also, Timbaland 
seems to like to include 
loud guitars on tracks like 
"Jade's the Champ," but 
when he mixed it, he for-
got to lower their sound, 
because Jade's voice IS 
drowned out each time.

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team com-
peted in the Point Lorna 

azarene Invitational amidst a 
field of eight teams on April 6 and 
April 7 at the inging Hills Golf 
Course in San Diego. 

As a team, the Tritons took third 
overall, but posted an impressive 
first-round score of 286, twO under 
par. For the April 6 afternoon 
round, UC D hot a 294, and fin-
ished on April 7 with a round score 
of 304, giving them an 8 4 overall 
for the tournament, 20 over par. 

"[Singing Hills] is a local 
course that we play often, but they 
tried to trick it up a little for the 
tournament," said UCSD head 
coach Mike \Nydra . "After the 
first day, because the cores were a 
!tttle low, they hid the pinS a little 
more, and the wind picked up as 
well, making it tougher." 

Point Lorna took first place 
overall with rounds of 1 3, 294 
and 292, giving them a total of 69 
for the tournament, five over par. 
Master's College took the num-

ber-two pot for the tournament, 
hooting rounds of 293, 290 and 

295 to give them a total of 878 
overall, 14 over par. 

C U Monterey Bay came in 
fourth overall, shooting 301, 302 
and 296 for a final score of 899, 35 
over par. Mt. Vernon azarene 
took fifth place by shooting 
round of 3 II , 302 and 296 for a 
total of 909. Point Loma's B team 
followed in sixth \vith rounds of 
305, 193 and 313 to give them 911 
for the tourney. 

Holy Names College took the 
number-seven pot With rounds of 
306, 29 and 311 for a total of 
914. Northwest Nazarene round-
ed out the eight teams with rounds 
of 309, 302 and 304 for a final 
core of9 15 . 

Individually, UCSD was once 
again led by junior Alan cheer, 
who po ted a 21 on the tourna-
ment, twO over par, putting him in 
a tie fo r fifth place overall. His 
round scores were 73,7 1 and 74. 

Sophomore Joe Dolby fol-
lowed up Scheer, also placing in 
the top 10, tying for seventh place 
with a core of 219, three over par. 

Dolby shot round of 72, 71 and 
76. Freshman Robbie Kramer 
took third for the Tritons, shoot-
ing a 224 for the tournament with 
rounds of 69, 76 and 79, putting 
him at eight over par and in a tie 
for 16th place. 

"""e've been having a lot more 
consistency in our game lately," 
Wydra said. "A1an,Joe and Robbie 
are a very solid three for us, and 
we're looking for the remaining 
golfers for our upcoming tourna-
ments." 

Sophomore Eugene Itkin 
placed fou rth on UC D's team 
\\~th rounds of 74, 76 and 77, to 
give him a 227, II over par, and a 
21 st-place finish . enior Blake 
Schneider rounded out the 
Triton's squad, shooti ng rounds of 
72,79 and 77 for a total of 228,12 
over par, and in a tie for 22 nd 
place. 

The Tritons will be competing 
at the CSU Stanislaus Buzzini 
Invitational next week, on April 14 
and Apnl 15. The invitational will 
rake place at the Turlock Country 
Club, a cour e which has tradi-
tionally been short and tight, 

according to Wydra, but which 
has recently had its greens dug up 
and redone. 

"We're just going to have to try 
out the new greens and see how 
they play," Wydra said.

Masters: 
Johnson 

stands firm 
. 

on issue 
cominl<cd from page ::I 4 

which Johnson belongs, and fur-
thermore, it is only one of count-
less elite social clubs that dot the 
country. So why has the debate 
closed in on this quiet Georgia 
town? Why on this club? Why 
now' 

. Burk's role in the ongoing battle 
has been that of the aggressor, 
launching a barrage of equal rights 
claims at the Augusta member hip 
huddled in a bunker fortified bv 
the freedom of association. While 
all-male and all-female country 
clubs are not common, they exist in 
noteworthy numbers. The chances 
are, however, that unless you 
belong to one, you can't name any 
of these other clubs. Four national -
ly televised days in April, each year, 
give Augusta National something 
most other place don't have -
visibi lity. That in turn gives Burk 
something she desperately needs 
- publicity. 

The national media has fixed 
this iconocla tic cia hand nlrned 
the leader of an obscure D. . 
political lobby into a household 
name. It has also brought gender 
struggles to the forefront of the 
national conscience. Were it 110t 
for the war, Augusta would likely 
have claimed front-page attention 
in many media markets. Burk has 
brought notoriety to herself and 
the cause with significant effect. 

Burlc asked CBS - who owns 
the broadcast rights to The 
Masters - not to broadcast the 
event. They refu ed, but not 
before Johnson "fired" the pon-
sors, not wi hing them to endure 
scorn for hiS club's policies and 
chose to do it alone. The result is a 
del ightfully commercial-free tele-
cast, but a constam reminder of the 
controversy. Stir has also been 
caused by Burk's plan to protest 
outside the club during the tourna-
ment. The changing of a city coun-
cil ordinance, and protest permi t 
procedures have cau 'ed the poten-
tial impact of the demonstration to 
be lessened, and a federal judge'S 
ruling on April 7 that prevents 
protests from being held outside 
the club's front gate further mar-
ginalizes the effect of the protest-
ers. (Burk appealed the decision .) 

T hese ordinances have 1101 pre-
vented others from applying to 
protest. Reverend JesseJaekson ha 
applied to bring a group to speak 
out against Augusta ational's pol-
icy, and a one-man offshoot of the 
Klu KJux Klan has promi ed to 
come in order to protest Jackson's 
protesting. 

While the legal powers that eem 
to side with Augusta National's tra-
ditional decision not to admit 
women (the club has no fonnal pol-
ICY excluding women from becom-
ing member ), the ocial stigma 
associated with the discriminaoon is 
having an effect. Several members 
have resigned from the club and 
others have inti 1113 teel they would 
decline an invitaoon to jom were It 
offered . The war of amition has 
claimed ca unIties on either ide, but 
both Burk and Johnson are resolute-
ly stubborn and neit her appear 
willing 10 back down. 

And so it stands. A drama and a 
comedy unfold in the beautifully 
tai lored land ca pe of Augusta's 
pri 7.e landmark. The extreme 
reformists square off with the 
stuffy traditionalist in a duel for 
the age, and just because thi ver-
ion of the story includes everyone 

chasi ng after a Tiger, in tead of a 
gopher, it doesn't make It any Ie 
outrageous. 

The actor, the bUild-up, the 
~tory line ." all Igns point to a 
memorable weekend. And oh yeah, 
they'll be playing golf too. 

THURSDAY. APRIL 10.2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 19 

'CLUB SPORTS Toumey: 
MEN'S LACROSSE 

After the Tritons upset the 18th-
ranked Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs 
8-7 on March 23, the UCSD men!> 
lacrosse team began a string of 
home games on April 8 against 
crosstown rival SDSU. The Tritons 
haven't lost to SDSU in their last six 
meetings, and continued the win-
ning streak in a game that was dom-
inated by UCSD's offense. 

The Tritons quickly got a 5-0 
lead at the end of the first quarter, 
led primarily by Nick Dean and 
Matt Lafiandra . The UCSD 
offense seemed to score at will, 
keepihg the ball in Aztec territory 
for most of the quarter. 

SDSU regrouped in the econd 
with three goals, although UC D 
quickly re ponded to each, keep-
ing the score weighted in their 
favor at 8-3, by the half. 

UCSD was also plagued in the 
second half by penalties, with 
SDSU scoring on many of their 
man-up opportunities. 

UCSD's Ross Stensrud stepped 
up in the third quarter with three 
quick goals to boo t UC D's lead. 
The Aztecs could never fully over-
come their grO\ving deficit, and 
UCSD played a solid second half 
to finish the game 17-10. 

UCSD is hosting Arizona on 
April II at 7p.m. at RIMAC fi eld, 
and Arizona tate on April 14 at I 
p.m. at Warren Field. The team 
will be having a free BBQ for the 
fans at their April II game. UCSD 
and Arizona are currently tied in 
the \Vestern Collegiate Lacrosse 
League Southern Divi Ion. 

WATER SKI 
At the Northwest Conference 

Waterski season opener hosted by 
UC Davis at Bel Acqua, UCSD 
was once again in championship 
form. UCSD's Peter Mehrhoff 
rerurned froni France less than a 
week before, only [0 lead his 
Tritons to the team slalom title, 
edging the Chico State Wildcats 
by 40 points. Mehrhoff bettered 
his personal best jump by one foot 
to lead the Triton men to a clean 
sweep of the men S team events. 

UCSD head coach Bill 
Schneiderwind said Mehrhoff is a 
phenomenal athlete. He had not 
been on the water due to his quarter 
abroad, and yet comes back to win 
overall in the tournament. The rest 
of the gang worked hard in spring 
training to get ready, and it paid off. 

Tim Odell, Jeff Orr and new-
comer freshman Ian Ford added 
significa nt performances to join 
Mehrhoff in leading UCSD. 

In women's trick, SDSU picked 
up where it left off last fall with 
solid showings in slalom and again 
edged Out UCSD. UCSD fresh-
man Lindsay Baxters performance 
was second-best in Triton history. 

UCSD's Katie Ambrose and 
Mehrhofflead the Tritons back into 
Pacific Conference action next 
weekend as SDSU and UCLA co-
host their tournament at Honons 
Lake in Newberry prings.

Baseball: Tritons win two 
in four ... game home series 

continued {rom page 24 
In the seven-inning third game, 

the second of the doubleheader. 
UCSD freshman pitcher Byron 
Grubman gave another stellar per-
formance, striking Out four batters 
and giving up just one run on five 
hits. He leads the Triton pitching 
staff with a perfect 7 -0 record. 

UCSD put up three runs in the 
third inning of the game. Fante 
doubled down the left field line, 
driving in two runs. Keith Albrecht 
drove in the third run of the inning 
with a single. 

The Tritons also scored single 
runs in the fourth and fifth irUlings. 
Brett Burton stole home plate in 
the fourth to put UCSD ahead 4-1 . 

F ante went a perfect 3 -for-3 
with a double, while catcher Man 
Kennison went 2-for-3. 

Though not apparent to most, 
the Tritons have sustained some 
injuries. keeping some players from 
being able to function in their nor-
mal roles. Reshuffling both the 
batting lineup and defensive posi-
tions has presented UC D head 
coach Dan O'Brien and the team 
with some difficulty. 

"We have suffered some big 
losses lately. but we will just use it 
as an opportunity for us to get 
better as a team and prove that we 
are very good at reacting to adver-
sity,n O'Brien said. 

In game four, UCSD was 
unable to muster up any runs as 
they lost the series fi nale 6-0 to 
San Francisco State. 

The Gators scored three runs 
in the second inning, two in the 
fourth , and an additional run in 
the fifth to seal their victory. 

In his second start, UCSD 
freshman pitcher Justin Suarez 
gave up five runs in 3.1 innings. 
Suarez. picked up the loss and fell 
to 0-1 on the season. 

UCSD remains atop the 
CCAA with a record of 18-10, 24-
16 overall. 

The Tritons travel north to take 
on Chico State in a four-game 
series this weekend, beginning on 
April II . Chico is currently in third 
place in the CCM with a record of 
14-10. 

"It should be a weekend that 
will be a match up of two very 
similar team ,n O'Brien said.

"The Valdosta match came 
down to No. 3 Tara Siddiqui's 
third se t to determine the win-
ner," LaPlante said. "Tara played 
one of the best matches I've seen, 
and although she lost, she played 
a fantastic match and never quit." 

The last game UC D played 
was against West Florida . 
However. the Tritons were only 
able to finish four matches before 
pulling out to get to the airport. 

At the No. I singles court,

Westerman 6-1, 6-1. t O. 4,

"All tlle teams were tough,n 
LaPlante said. "West Florida, 
which we didn't fini h, is ranked 
No. 4 nationally, North Florida 
[is] ranked No. II and Valdosta 
[is] No. 15. We're No. 13. The

With only one more game 
IlIltil the post season, LaPlante is 
proud of what the team was able 
to accomplish in Florida. 

"All the teams have mosdy for-

LaPlante said. "Their top players 
are very good. but we compete 
fairly evenly at the lower end of the 
line up because of our depth." 

The Tritons next face Point

At No. I , Swatt and Chopra had 
a tall order, facing the top-ranked 
doubles team in the nation, Jan 
Krejci and Peter Madrassy, who 
defeated them 8-3. The Tritons 
secured a victory at No. 2, with the 
doubles pair of Wilson and Tomas 
Novak edging out Hong Tae Kim 
and Jong-Woong Yoon in a close 
one, 9-8. At No. 3, Nagel and

Singles proved to be difficult for 
the Tritons, losing five of the six 
matches. Chopra lost to their top-
ranked singles player Krejci in 
straight sets 6-4, 6-2. Swatt played 
the No. 12 singles player and lost 
in three sets. 4-6, 6-4, 6-1. Meyer 
lost to Yoon 6-2, 6-4, and Wilson-
Hayden lost 6-3, 7-5. Wilson also 
lost 6-3,6-2 to Chang. Emil Novak 
tallied the only singles victory for 
UCSD, defeating Leon So'onalole 
7-5.6-4. 

"We competed well for the 
most part [against West Florida 
and BYU HawaiiJ . I think we were 
struggling a bit with our doubles 
play for some reason, and not real-
ly making enough service returns. 
Mentally, we were not able to con-
tinue to be as strong in the second 
set as we were in the first set in sev-
eral matches against West Florida 
but that improved against BYU," 
Steidl mayer said. 

The 10 ses to the 0.2 and o.

will because they came out in full 
force against Armstrong Atlantic 
on AprilS, with a resounding 7-2

Doubles play proved to be 
stronger with the Tritons winning 
two of the three matches, taking an

With a o. 20 ranking, the top 
spot in the California Collegiate 
Athletic As ociation and a success-
ful 6-1 homestand , the UCSD 
men's tennis team eagerly packed 
their bags and flew to Pensacola, 
Fla., on April 2 to play their tough-
est matches of the season against 
the No.2, No. 3 and o. 12 teams 
in the country. 

"Our attitude was like a young 
fighter wanting to get in the ring 
with the champions. We wanted to 
prove what we could do," said 
UCSD head coach Eric 
Steidl mayer. "Our . expectations 
were to have tough matches. We 
didn't really know the level our 
opponents would bring and so we 
only expected tough, competitive 
matche ." 

The opposition was tough 
indeed as the Tritons dropped their 
first two matches against o. 3 
West Florida and o. 2 BYU 
Hawaii, but managed to resurge 
and defeat o. 12 Armstrong 
Atlantic to finish off the West 
Florida Tournament 1-2. 

UCSD played its first match of 
the tournament against West 
Florida on April 3 and lost 7-2. In 
doubles, the Tritons found them-
elves in a 3 -0 hole, as the Argos 

swept early on. Bryan Swart and 
Sameer Chopra lost to o. 13 pair 
of Radovan Chrz. and Daniel 
Steinhilber 8-6. Jeff Wilson and 
Tommy ovak lost to Fernando 
Damus and Guillaume Deverbizier 

-6. And ean agel and Mike 
Meyer lost to Paulius Jurkenas and 
Mario Vergara by a score of -6. 

The TritOns did nor fare any 
bener in singles, losing four 
matches in straight sets, while only 
tallying a couple of singles victo-
ric . At 0.1 singles, Chrz, ranked 

0.14 nalionally, dcfeated hopra 
6-4, 6-3 . At No. 2, watt 10 t to 
Deverbizier 6-2, 6-1 and at o. 3,

si ngles, in which Emil ovak 
defeated Mario Vergara, and 
Wilson defeated yen Glaser with 
scores of 7-6, 6-3 and 6-2, 6-3, 
respectively. 

"Our performance against West 
Florida was OK. I don't think we 
played well by any means, but not 
bad either, Just somewhere in the 
rruddle. [The Argos] are talented 
all the way through, and probably 
didn't let us playas well as we 
could," Steidl mayer said. 

UC D next faced off agamst 
another top-ranking team, playing 

0.2 BYU llawali on April 4, and 
lost 7-2 for the second day in a 
row. 

"Again t BYU, we were pretty 
poor in doubles in all the matches 
and fairly good in singles in nearly 
all the matches. Again, a decent 
performance, With nothing toO

Crew Classic 

UCSD races in 
four events at 
Mission Bay 

By CHRlsnNE LIM 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's crew has 
been steadily climbing the ladder 
toward becoming one of the best col-
legiate crews in the country. The 
Tritons lightweight eight crew I 
ranked No. 13 nationally. The var tty 
eIght IS ranked fourth in 'ational 
CollegIate Athlenc Assoclallon 
DIVI Ion n. Under head coach PattI 
Pinkerton's rrail1lng, the team has 
competiove JUniors and emors for the 
first ome. 

"The JUl1Ior and el1lors on the 
team are good for the first orne lin my 
coachll1g time here l," Pinkerton said. 
"It takes about three years to perfect 
kills." 

On April 5 and April 6, UCSD 
competed In the an Diego Crew 
Classic at Mission Bay, against some of 
the tOP crew teams in the country, 
including Princeton, Stanford and UC 
Berkeley, as well as local rivals USD 
and SDSU. The Crew Classic was the 
bigge t regatta of the season and one 
of the last regattas before a compeo-
tive post-season. 

On April 5, UCSD competed in 
four races and qualified for races the 
next day. 

In the collegiate lightweight heat 
B, UC D finished last with a time of 
8: 17.27 . Stanford's A boat finished 
first with 7:35.8, Villanova at 7:38.99, 
Cal at 7:53.58 and CSU Long Beach

A big, prestigiou country club i rocked by an outsider who challenges Its member-ship and traditions and causes a sti r in the 
surrounding community. This isn't another 
"Caddyshack" sequel. This is Augusta 

ational. 
The Masters, arguably the most presti-

gious golf tournament in the world, runs April 
10-13 . A top field is assembled and the 
defending champion returns in pursuit of a 
tbreepeat, but most of the discussion revolves 
around climate. 

The weather report calls for light showers 
early in the week, but clearing as the weekend 

progresses. The report concerning the politi -
cal climate paints a far stormier picture. 

Just less than 10 months ago, the chair of 
the adonal Council of Women's 
Organizations, Martha Burk, wrote a letter to 
the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, 
Hootie Johnson. Burk's letter urged Johnson 
to add a woman to the rolls of Augusta's mem-
bership.Johnson's reply stated in no uncer tai n 
terms that the club did not intend to be bul-
lied and that any decision on the subject would 
be made on the club's timetable, "and not at 
the point of a bayonet." 

The seemingly knee-jerk reaction paints a 

stereotypical picture of thi man called 
l lootie: a rich, whIte , old South, racist, seu t 
male as stubborn as he is old. 1 Iootie's past 
paints quite a different picture. This is the 
same man who lobbied for the removal of the 
Confederate flag from the ollth Carolina 
capitol building, was a driving force in admit-
ting a black member to Augusta and was pres-
ident of the fi rst statewide bank to put a 
woman on its board of directors. 

T he e public endeavors aside, Augusta 
National is not the only exclusive club to

UCSD baseball hosted
