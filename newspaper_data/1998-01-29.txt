Food Poisoning 
Vaccine Developed 
LlNCOL , Neh.-
Researchers at the University 
of Nebraska - Lincoln are lead-
ing an effort to create vaccines 
against hotulism bombs which 
carry the severe type of food 
poisoning caused by the 
microorganism Clostridillfll 
bOllllilltll1l . Botulism can kill 
an unprotected person within 
days. Three years ago, the U.S. 
Anny signed a $690,000 con-
tract with UNL to develop the 
vaccines. Mike Meagher, asso-
ciate professor of food science 
and technology, said that his 
team developed a vaccine for 
one strain and is work ing to 
lind a vaccine lor the others. 
Meagher said pressure to linish 
the vaccines has risen because 
of growing tensions between 
the United Nations and Iraq .

Survey' Finds Freshmen Apathetic 
STUDY: A record number of 
fir t-year students plan to 
attend graduate school 
By Sula Kim 
Guardian Reporter 

According to a recent study conducted by 
the Higher Education Research Institute at 
UCLA's Graduate School of Education and 
Information Studies, today 's college freshmen 
are less intere ted in academics and po litics 
than any other class of the past 32 years. 

Out of the 348,465 students surveyed at 665 
of the nation's two- and four-year colleges, a 
record-high 36 percent of freshmen said they 
were often bored in class during their last year 
of high school, compared with a low of 26.4 
percent in 1985. 

This year, 34.5 percent of 'tudent said they 

overslept and missed class, while only 18.8 per-
cent did so in 1968. However, an all -time high 
of 15.3 percent of freshmen said they plan to 
pursue doctoral degrees. 

"Academic credentials, rather than a love of 
learning, seem to be therr moti va tion," sa id 
Linda Sax, survey director and visiting assis-
tant professor of education at UCLA. "These 
trends suggest that while students' level of 
involvement in their studies is down, they real -
ize the need to be successful in college in order 
to remain competitive ror graduate school 
admissions." 

Daniel Kim, a Revelle freshmen, said hi s 
peers arc not enthusiastic about school. 

"People around me, even my uitemates, iile 
biggest thing I see is intense boredom," he said. 

Revelle freshmen Sandra Zipperer said that 
as long as ~tudents are in college, the reason as

Crime Rates 
Decrease 
STATISTICS: N umber of auto 
thefts and violent crimes in 
1997 is lower than in 1996 
By Christine Velarde 
Staff Writer 

U SO is a safer <.:ampus than it was last 
year, according to the 1997 crime statisti cs 
released by the campus police department this 
week. 

Al:cording to Crime Prevention Officer Alan 
Jenkins, there were a total of 33 vehicle theft s 
and attempted vehicle thefts in 1997. This was 
substantially lower than the 1996 total of 62 
vehicle thefts and attempted thefts, and the 
lowest number since 1985. 

"Vehicle theft is the closest thing to a crime 
problem we have," Jenkins said. "The lower 
rates are due to a combination of the police 
department and car owners being safer. More 
people have alarms and are taking more pre-
cautions. " 

San Diego was dubbed an auto-theft capi tal 
in recent years, but Jenkins sa id he believes thl! 
lower crime rate on campus rellects overall 
lower crime rates in San Diego. 

City and <.:ounty administrators have devel-
oped a regional auto theft task force in re<.:elll 
years that specialiLes in investigating and 
arresting of career auto thieves. 

"Anytime you have a football field -s ized 
parking lot, theri will be theft," Jenkins said. 
"We'd like to have zeros, but it 's nice to have 
trends going down." 

The recovery rate of stolen vehicle has 
been estimated at 60 to 65 percent. Most 'lolen 
cars are stripped for parts or arc sent to another 
<.:ountry. 

The vehicle crime report showed that more 
vehicles are stolen arou nd the holiday season 
than at any other time. 

Moreover, Hondas, Toyotas and Fords are 
the most frequently siolen vehicles. Jenkins 
said that Ihis may be because lhese cars art' Ihe

Ex-5kinhead T.J. Leyden Visits 
UCSD and Speaks About Hate _ ~19) ~~0630j 
DISCUSSION: Former 
Neo-Nazi reflects on 
how he became a racist 
By Aileen Delacruz 
Guardian Repo r ter 

With the number of reponed 
hate crimes on Ihe ri se nationwide, 
ex -Nco-Nazi skinhead T.J . Leyden 
addressed a gathering of w ncerm:d 
sludents in Pelerson Hall on 
Tuesday evening. 

Leyden offered hi s violenl hi '-
tory not only as a vehicle to lend 
insight into the etiology of racism. 
but also to prov ide a deterrent 
against the entire lifesty le. 

Raised Iri sh-Ca tho lic in an 
upper-middle c lass soulhern-
Californian suburb, Leyden l:harac-
teri zed hi5 youth as one immersed 
in drinking, fighting and Oi, an 
ascetic brand of punk music. 

Citing music and comics as the 
chi ef too ls utilized 10 spread 
derogatory stereo types of rac ial-
minorit y groups, Leyden l: redited 
the punk-rock movement of the late 
1970s for the rapid proliferati on of 
skinhead acti vity. 

Though his mother and father 
never expressed animosity towards 
other ethni cities, Leyden adhered 
to the tenets imposed by his grand-
father: "Never bring darki es home 
to our house," "Jews were the 
kill ers of Chri st," and " If you ever 
wear orange on St. Patrick 's Day,

For Leyden, the "glory hi gh" he 

gained through brutalizing African 
Americans, Hispanics and Asian 
A mericans served as sufficienl jus-
ti f ication 10 adopt his grandfather'S 
philosoph ies. 

Leyden said he reveled in " boot 
panics." assaults in which he and 
hi s fri ends rendered their victims 
irreparably disfigured or para lyzed. 
Despile being an'ested and spend-
ing time at the San Bernardino 
County jai l, Leyden has no felony 
convictions on his record . 

By shedding light on the elabo-
rale tactics racist facti ons employ 
to entice new members, Leyden 
alerted his audience to methods of 
manipulal ion. 

According to Leyden, recruil ers 
prirnari Iy target adolescent males 
between the ages or 13 and 15. 
Materi als distributed to these ado-
It:scents carry images and themes 
intended to vilify cultural groups 
olher than Iheir own . 

Leyden said his service in the 
U.S. Marine Corps sharpened his 
skill as a soldier, disciplining him 
in the ans of weaponry, survi val 
and loyalty. 

"The military made me a beller 
racist," Leyden said. 

Upon receiving an other-than-
honorable discharge, not for his 
openly racist beliefs, but for refusing 
lreatment for alcohol abuse, Leyden 
became a recruiter himself, advising 

young men to enter the armed forces 
10 prepare them for what he 
descri hcs as an ongoing race war. 

Leyden orchestrated all,ll:ks on 
minority groups, often in conj um:-
lion with the leaders of ri va l, sepa-
ra tist-minded gangs, for the sole 
purpose of cultivating a fresh stock 
of incensed individuals. 

His brother's dec ision 10 work as ' 
a police ofllcer marked the incep-
lion or a new influence on Leyden. ' 
Leyden said that watching Ihe night-
ly news and the report of yel anoth-
er onicer killed in the line of duty I 
made hi m start to reconsider his I 
ideas. The game lost its allure. 

Ultimately, Leyden said his chil-
dren incited him to denounce his alle-
giance to skinhC:lds altogether. 

Leydcn recalled his three-year-
old sun announcing, " Daddy, we , 
don' t watch shows with niggers in 
this house," and promptly cl icking 
off the lelevi sion. 

Alanned by the remark, Leyden 
envisioned his son's future. He said 
he pictured a bleak ex istence, 
marred by apparitions of those sacri -
fi ced in the name of " white pride." 
His pictured his son, twi ce as hard 
and cruel as he had ever been. 

Leyden sa id the poss ibilily dev-
astated him. He severed his tic ' 
with the hate movement. 

Leyden urged hi s audience 10 
lead by example, encouraging par-
ents to take their children to a wide 
speclrum of cultural evenl s.

The World Turns While 
America Stands StUI 

Enough already! We are about to bomb a country 
off the face of the earth and all the media is focusing 
on is President Clinton 's alleged affair with a White 
House intern. We should let Clinton attempt to keep 
this country out of war instead of di stracting him 
with stories that aren't necessarily true. 

Iraq. although not exactly one of our best fri ends, 
is hardly deserving of oblivion as a result of presi -
dential distraction. 

If Clinton was anyone else, his alleged affair with 
Monica Lewinsky would not even be a blip on our 
national radar screen. He is the president . however, 
so we hold him to a higher standard. 

Moral issues aside, did Clinton ask Lewinsky to 
lie about their relationship? H is previous troubles 
have all centered on issues of questionable legality or 
morality, but this particular si tuation may be grounds 
for impeachment. 

If he didn't do it, the American people have seen 
their president dragged Ihrough the mud on yet 
another of Kennelh Starr's groundless fishing expe-
ditions . If he did do it. then perhaps he should resign 
- but until this is sellled, one way or the other, the 
mediu should focus on other pertinent national issues. 

[I' he asked Lewinsky to lie. then he has broken the 
law and he should be held accountable for it. 
Otherwise, let's just ull forget about it and let him get 
back to work . 

Super Bowl Couldn't Have 
aeen Better for San Diego 

Th(.: Denver Broncos may have defealed the Green 
Bay Packers last Sunday in Super Bowl XXXll, but 
the City of San Diego was th (.: real winner. 

"America's Finesl City" pUI on a show for Ihe ages 
and did itself a greal service by ex pertl y managing 
one of Ihe biggest hoopla-media events thi s side of 
the Olympics. 

Tourism in San Dil!go reached an all -time high , 
and local businesses were well -prepared for the 
spl!nding frenzy. Thl! San Diego Convention & 
Visitors Bureau has projected that the city ilself 
earned a cool $232.7 million. That 's a big deal. 

Not only did Super Bowl XXXII provide jobs, bUI 
il gave the cit V a much-needed eeo hoost. For om: 

" '-' .. 

weekend, San Diego was the center of the world and 
all eyes were focused upon it. For once, the game 
wasn ' t bad, either. 

Barring a few negatives - noise complaints from 
Mission Valley and Midtown residents regarding air traf-
fic noise; trolley technical difficulties attributed to the 
4O,OOO-plus passengers packing trains on Super Sunday; 
and a few instances of unruliness in the Gaslamp Quaner 
- Super Bowl XXXll will be remembered as one of the 
greate 't events this city has ever seen. 

Good luck to Ihe city in its NFL-endorsed bid to 
host the big game again in 2002.

CLINTON SCANDALS RESULT OF 
UCSD STUDENT'S CONSPIRACY 

COMMENTARY: The recent Lewinsky scandal is actually a conspiracy contrived 
by a right-wing UCSD student et on impeaching the ethically challenged president 

C H R I 5 rl~l SCHREIBER 
My Biased Opinion 

They figured it oul. I\fter all my 
yea r, uf ca reful preparali on, Ihey 
finally caught on. 

I donncd the di;gui,c of a not -so-
mild-mannercd co llege ,Iude nt in 
sleepy. old La Jolla . I even immersed 
myself in the quagmire thai passes for 
the UCSD soc ial scene for years in 
order to execute my pernicious plol. 

Howeller, now it is all for naughl 
because the president, lirst lady and 
the sharpest Friends of Bill (hereafter 
icfcrcnccd ~s FO.B.) !:~ve di sCGY'D il:d 
my far-flung conspiracy to ruin Bill 
Clinlon 's presidency. 

That's right , boys and girls, you did 
read that correctly. It was me all along. 

When Hiltary Clinton refers 10 the 
" far-flung , right -wing conspiracy" 
against her husband from "the day he 
announced hc was running for presi -
dent," she refers to me. 

When James Carville rants on in his 
Cajun accent about forces of the radieal 
right and big tobacco industries working 
against Clinton, he rants about mc. 

They were destined to discoller me 
just as my plans were coming to 
fruition, too. All Ihe wonderful chaos I 
wroughl was finally building steam 
toward a Clinlon impeachment, but 
once word of the cunspiracy gets out, 
that plan will certainly be derailed . 
Thc F.O.B. are just too good . 

In order to execute an impeachment, 
I plotted a careful and detailed plan. 

First, I orchestrated the whole 
Whitewater fiasco. 

Making key documents disappear to 
creak! a shady place for the first couple 

W~ eny. MatIng tho e dOCuments 

It seemed the final 
laugh would be mine, 
however, with the 
latest blowup. Yt:~, I 
was responsible for 
the Big lewinsky (the 
scandal, not the 
woman). 
reappear months, and ellen years, later 
10 make it appear as if the Clinlons were 
hiding evidence and obstructing justice 
was a bit tougher, but nothing too difli-
cult for a far-flung, right·wing conspira-
cy to accompli h. 

Then I orchestrated the Paula 
Corbin-Jones sexual-harassment law-
suil and trial , including the Supreme 
Court vote allowing the suit to go to 
trhil while Clinton held office. 

It shou Id halle been obllious that 
extremely careful planning and flawless 
excculion - rather than Clinton's unre-
strained libido, disrespect for his high 
gOllemment office and for women -
led to the whole sordid affair. 

I mean, would Clinton, then-gollernor 
of Arkans:lS, halle the unmitigated gall to 
call the then-Miss Comin up to a hoIeI 
suite, and when she go« there, unzip his' 
'ny' aixI is\'1ief to 'kisS "Liltle Willie' ''1 ' , 

Who cares if he has a long hi story 
of such philanderin g, or that Arkansas 
state troopl!rs have teslified Ih at th ey 
were ;,sked to prOl:ure women for hi m 
on numerous occasions'} The result , 
were c lcarly dfecls of my influcnce. 

Another one of my schemes wa, 
Hiltary's alTair with the callie futures. 

It may sccm implausi bl e, but mar· 
ring the first lady's reputation was not 
all that difficu lt. I merely had to usc 
my far-flung influence to manipulate 
the entire futures market so that the 
ups and downs coincided exactl y with 
Hillary's trades. Then, I brihed the reg· 
ulat ors so that Ihe movements in 
Hill ary's accounts , too large for legal 
limits, were ignored. 

Come an l :idrrdi iL Thai's a far 
more plausible than the other, more 
commonly accepted explanation. You 
know, the one where the commodities 
broker manipulated open contracts so 
Mrs. Clinton always came out on the 
up side as a cOllert way to bribe the 
Clintons for gubernatorial favors. 

Politicians taking bribes for influ -
ence, especia ll y those who meet 
Clinton's impeccable moral standards, 
is just too unlikely. 

1be feather in my cap was supposed 
to be the so-called "Filegate" scandal. 
Gelling thousands of confidential FBI 
files into the possession of the 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) 
and the White House was no easy task. 

When Nixon was impeached, t.he 
scandal revolved around stealing some 
psychologists ' files from thc DNe 
offices, and then fabricating the cOller-
up. They discovered thousands of clas-
sitied FBI files, but Bill was once 
again just a hair too slick for such an 
obllious scandal. 

Abuse of presidential power by using 
the FBI for campaign information, you 
'Say? At least some petty theft for pilfer-

Written by German 
playwright 
Ferdinand 

Brnckner and first 
produced in 
Hamburg, 

Germany, (Pains 
of Youth JJ reflects 

troubles that plague 
students of today. 

Story by Ilona Fass, 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

spi ral you can' t stop." 

tanding at the threshold of adulthood, a group of 
yo ung frie nd s do everything they can to spit in the face 

of res ponsibilit y, ultimately going down in a fiery blaze 
or sex, drugs and power. These fri ends create a world 

within which the characters are victims of bot h them-
selves and each other. 

This is the premise for Ferdinand Bruckner 's 
play, "Pains of Youth ," direc ted by UCS D gradu ate 
student Steve Cosson and presented by UCSD The-

atre and Dance. 
In a recent int erv iew with the Guardian, Cos son 

said "IThe play is] a shock to th e system; it 's a downward 

To fully enjoy "Pains of Youth," one should understand the hi storical context of 
the play. Originally created in response to the politi cal climate of pos t-war Germany. 
" Pai ns of Youth" is relevant to issues of today's university students . The drama 
points to the disturbing reality that we are all just a millimeter away from stepping 
ove r the precipice of insanity. 

Cusson compared the era out of which "Pains of Youth" emerged to Tile Greal 
Ga lsby set in an econom ically devastated world . It was also a time in which great 
precedence was given tu Freudi an and Nietzche philosophy. Especia ll y the laller 
because he spearheaded the idea of a st rong, ruthless individuaL" 

Such were the qualities admired by the Germans at the time the play is set in . This 
context makes understandable the motives of the lead characters. 

One Icad female character. Marie (played by Mary Catheri ne Garrison), is a 
woman who has it all. She is headed on a path toward a successful ca reer in medi -
cine, and is engaged to Petrell (Michael Bakkensen), a writer she has been finan -
cially supporting for the past two years. When Petrell leaves her high and dry for 
Irene (Lori Yeghiayan) , Marie snaps like a piece of briUle wood. 

Marie's ca refully mapped-out path takes a violent. detour as she heads straight for

Stealin'The Spotlight 
Overshadowed dancers puton a good show 
By Naomi Walker 
51aff Wrirer 

You know ahout tap dance: 
you've heard about Iri sh dancc; 
now meet the "Lord of the Dance." 

In a tantali zing combination of 
tap . line dancing and Irish rh ythm 
and funk , th is group comhined the 
best of dance-foot work to creat~ 
one show-stomping ex travaganza. 
The dancers jigged. tapped. 
jum ped, ki cked and turned with a 
speed and prec ision that poumk d 
out a rhythm and a form that was 
all their own. It was 

"Lord of the 

re maic dalll;er, stage- right. It W:lS 
ohvious that Flatley wanted to 
es tah lish himselr as the hero of 
th e show, as we ll as the bes t 
dancer in it. 

The truth i, that all of the 
dancers were very talented, yet 
Flatley obscured their hard work hy 
jumping and gyrating in rront of 
them. This i ~ parl i~ ula rly rcprehen-
sihle as a show i, onl y as strong as 
the ~Ull1 of its parl;.

obvious that 
Flatley 
wanted to 
establish 

the produ ction and 
the hi gh caliher of the 
dancing. 

The foot work was 
unparall e led. a:, the 
da ncers employed 
the rhythm of thei r 
hodic; in exprc"ion, 
and created mus ic 

and even magic himself as 
tricks. 

Unfonu n:llely, the the hero of

and everythin g e lse revo lved

Flatley insisted on dancing in 
front of the line of dancers. He 
made sure that the spotlights sin-
gled him out and that the television 
screens showed hi s face only. 

While the dancers were bu sy 
pou nding out rh yt hm and move-
ment , Flatley was pawing a 

the singing and the di:,appcaring 
ac t ~. however, ~cre a fct:hle 
attempt 10 augment the perfo r-
mance. 

While the effects added some 
spi cc, they were also reminiscent 
of a clHlap Las Vegas show. Ha v-
ing two women parade around the 
stage as plastic imitations of the 
virg in and the whore did nothing 
to display their talent , rather it 
was a comment on Flatley's poor 
taste and choreographin g ability. 
All of the ta lent was there, it was 
just the manner in which it was 
presented lhatleft someth ing to be 
desired.

AJ1jani Is the Spice of India Stars Shine At Super Jam 
UCSD event brought Eastern culture, fun to campus Superstars put on a good how at hip-hop fe tival 

By Jennifer Feldman 
Staff Writer 

Many CSD student!> hav.: a miscon-
ception that all cent s and pcrforman 'cs 
on ca mpu s arc boring and unevcnt ful. 
Howeve r. Anjani' s Kathak Dance of India 
on Jan . 24 at Mandeville Auditorium 
proved to be exc iting, innovative and mes-
meri l in g. 

ot onl y did the performance incorpo-
rate six beautiful women dancing seduc-
tively to the sounds of pounding tabla 
drums and a graceful sitar, but it also 
includcd hilari ou ' commentary by the 
director and a classical Indian si nger who 
just recently starred in a Will mith rap 
video. 

Each of the dance. performed was not 
only elegant and beauliful to watch, but was 
also deeply rooted in spiritual and reli gious 
Indian beliefs. 

Kathak dance, whi ch arose from Indian 
religious trad itions aboul 4.000 years ago, 
aLtempts to embellish beautiful slOri es 
th rough dance. 

Over much of Indian hi , tnry, KlIthllk was 
maintained by a few dancer, and music ian, . 
Since the independ~nce of In lia . however, 
arts have been restored, and Karlwk danci ng 
i now considered a significant classical 
dance of India. 

Anjani Ambegaokar trai ned in all styles 
of Katlrak dance for over 20 years, receiv-
ing a Masler 's degree in Katlwk from the 
University of Baroda in India . 

Ambegaokar, founder anti teacher of 
her own dance sc hool, has also travelcJ all 
over the world. Her company has toured 
lhrough many citie ), and states throughout 
the United States. Anjani's Katlwk Dance 
of lndia is both intriguing and ncw. 
Although Ambegaokar llI ay not hc back in 
San Diego fo r a long time to come. there 
arc tabla and si lar pcrformances every 
quarter on campus.

Venues , uch as 4th & Band rhe Belly Up 
Tavern arc the only source of hip-hop and 
R&B in San Diego. In a coml11unity . 0 starved, 
San Diego's own JalJlmin ' Z90 attcmpted tu 
quench the city's appctile with The Super Bowl 
Supcr Jam Friday ni ght at the SpOIlS Arena. 

Arter hcav promOlion, the concert 's 
lineup contained the likes of Dru Hill , K-Ci 
ancl Jojo, D'stiny 's hild, Bam Jamerican)', 
Total, H-Town, ext. We. the legendary 
Run DM and LL Cool 1. 

Hungry hip-h(lp heads and R&B enlhusi-
asts showed up in full force LO suppon this rar!! 
musical evenl. Most of the acts were able to 
move th ' crowd and leave it screaming for 
morc. Newcomer li ke Destiny 's Child and 
Bom JallleJicans deserve an honorable men-
ti on for lhcir effons to get the pany staned. 

Other highlighls of the night included a 
good healthy dosage of hip-hop from WC of 
The Westside Connection, who gave one of 
the night's heller performances. WC per-
formed a medley of his Westside Connection 

and Madd Circle songs, and was !>lll prising-
Iy ~ t rnng withuut Ice Cube and Mack 10. 

Hun DMC was nice to 'ee as a reminder 
of how rar hip-hop has come. These pio-
neers of rap erved up many old favorites 
:II d concluded with their lasl successful hit , 
"Down Wit ' The King." 

The headlining act was none olher than 
the world-renowned LL Cool J. Uncle L per-
formed an impressive med ley of his own, 
covering songs like "Boomin' System," 
"Mama Said Knock You Out" and others 
wilhout any long breaks or pauses for 
brealh. 

The energetic LL also performed '" Need 
Love," a favorit e of all the ladies. Despite 
hi s giving a strong performance, LL was a 
bit disappointing as he did not perform other 
hits such as "4, 3, 2, I" and " I Shot Ya." 

LL did finish the nighl off with a positive 
message via hi s latest si ngle, "Father," 
which featured a li ve gospel choir. The song 
tell s LL's true story of growing up with an 
abusive fa ther, whi le conveying the moral of 
the importance of bei ng a good father.

Following an opening perror-
mance at last year 's Sun God Fe~ti ­
val and a win at the Belly Up Tav-
ern 's quarterly Bailie of the Bands 
competition, the release or C lyde 's 
Ride 's self-titl ed deb ul album 
marks anolher signifi cant step for 
th e band, which was founded by 
UCSD alumni Hugh Perk in and 
Jon Monahan. 

The albu m sw.:cessfully cap-
tures the band 's funkIR&B style, 
ranging from a bouncy, upbent 
groove in "B lue Dots" to a Jaid-
back, lounge-act feel in ''(' m Not 
Through Wilh You." 

The lalter ' how~ olT some of the 
group 's more pensive lyri cs -
"The way the rain dances on my 
skinllt makes my tea rs feel like 
they ' ve found their kin ," eroons 
one of the band's two vocalists, 
Derek Sapieo. 

"Biller" marks a hi gh point in 
the reco rd , working in a snaky, 
slilhering groove between intense 
choruses which. from the stand-
poinl of the dumped lover. angri ly 
denounce the dumpee. 

The harmonics and trade-offs 
between Sapko and the band 's 
other vucalisl , Lani Ludwig, keep 
the voca ls fresh and interesling. 
The rest of the band, comprised of 
drummer Johnny Fong, saxophon-
iSI Brian Yaspan, bassist Perkin and 
guitari sl Monahan, create a dance-
able vibe throughout. 

Taken individually, each of Ihe 
album's nine songs can definitely 
hold ils own. However, in the scope 
of the entire record , all of the tunes 
begin to sound similar. 

Nevertheless, Clyde's Ride 
shou Id be commended because, 
although their lineup consisls of 
singers, drummers, bass, guilar and 
horns, Ihey have avo ided go ing 
down the all-too- fami liar ska path 
in exchange ror a more timeless 
musical style emhod ied in Ihi s 
solid debut effort.

M 's Critical Beare/own changed 
the music and broughl hip·hop to

The absence or Eric B. does nOI 
ha ve mUl:h impact on this latest 
album since he had taken a hack 
sea t for quite some time, Wi lh 
Large Professor, Marley Marl and 
ol hers, producing th e bulk or the 
tracks. On The /8th Leller, Rakim 
reI urns with his nea rl y untouchab le 
lyrical style and delivery to show 
the world that New York hip-hup is 
nOI ahout run-of-the-mill pop rap-
ping and recycled tral:ks. 

Rakim 's lirst recording for Uni -
versa l linds him cnli sling DJ Pre-
mier, Pete Rock, DJ Clark Kent and 
o thers to prov ide the beals. 

Only "Slay Awhile" and "Show 
Me Love" mi ght ha ve listeners 
reaching for the fast forward, as the 
female choruses come across as 
rather generic. 

The tracks "Guess Who's Back" 
and "New York (Ya OUI There)" 
display the slrengths expected from 
Rakim. 

Anyone who is unfamiliar wilh 
Rakim 's earlier work can pick up

ICE HOCKEY 
When someone mentions "ice 

hockey," San Diego, due 10 its 
lack of an NHL team, probably 
does nOI eo me to mind. UCSD 
would be even more unlikely 10 
be thought of. 

However, afler its 6-2 victory 
Friday night against Cal State 
Northridge, iI's now valid 10 asso-
ciate "UCSD" wilh "ice hockey." 

After a miserable showing two 
weeks ago, when UCSD was 
completely shuldown by . 
Northridge 6-0, Ihe pueksters had 
revenge on Iheir minds. 

Erik Borman came up big wilh 
two goals, while Lawrence Chan 
and Jean Beattie also contributed 
goals to the cause. 

After Ihe lough loss IWO weeks 
ago, playoff hopes didn't look ter-
ribly bright. The playoffs are sti ll 
a reality though, but nOI an easy 
one, as UCSD will have to win 
six of its remaining eight games. 

"We work hard , skale hard and 
have a solid defense," Geier said. 

- John Maynard 

Many de erving players 
were snubbed because some 
sub-20-year-olds dunk their way 
onto every highlighl film. 

Fans today just want high-
lights. No one seems to appreci-
ate the players who are funda-
mentally sound and do the little 
lhings that help a team win. 

Rebounds and assists don't 
mailer. Fans want half-courl 
shots for a million dollars and 
dunks from the free-throw line. 

Some might say the All-Star 
game is showcase for the 
game 's most exciling players. 1 
believe it's a reward for the 
players that deserve to be named 
Ihe best in basketball . 

['m nOI walching the AII-Slar 
game this year; the popularity 
contesl has just gone too far. 

It's too bad that Latrell 
Sprewell isn'l an All-Star. They 
could gel rid of 2-Ball and just 
have a coach-slrangling conlest.

Greed Destroys 
NBA All-Star Game 

Lesson 2: More on Greed 
The la. t time I wrote ahout 

the BA, I mentioned that Kohe 
Bryant and Kevin Garnell arc 
some of the greedi est players in 
the game. 

ow people, I didn ' l neces-
saril y mean Ihal they arc Ihe 
hest players in the game. 

)' m nOI quite sure whal hap-
pened in the BA All-Star vot-
ing process th is year, hut some-
Ihing obviously went wrong. I 
think it ha to do wi lh the loca-
ti ons of the voting booths. 

Millions of people must have 
neen Sluffing the nallOI boxes 
while stuffing their faces with 
Big Macs at McDonald 's. I' m 
afraid that some of them got 
special sauce in their eyes and 
checked the wrong box . It is 
either that or these people are 
MORONS. 

Let me try to get through to 
some of the people who voted. 
Just pretend thai I' m yelli ng 
very slowly in your car: KOBE 
BRYANT DOES NOT STA RT 
FOR THE LAKERS SO HE 
SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT 
START FOR THE ALL- TA R 
TEAM . 

I must not have been notified 
when dunking hecame the only 
criteria for being in Ihe All-Star 
game. 

The fac t that Kobe and Kevin 
can both jump over a Ford 
Ex plorer and dunk the hall with 
Iheir teeth doesn' t mean they 
should be playing with the best 
players in the NBA. 

Well, after the fans screwed 
up, the coaches couldn 't stop 
the bleeding. There just wasn' t 
enough room on the All -Star 
roster for players Ihat actually 
deserved 10 be there 

What happened to Rod 
Strickland? I guess he just was-
n't good enough. He's leading 
the NBA in assists with 10 per 
game, hut , sorry Rod, you can 
only be an All-Star if you forget 
those assists and start dunking 
10 times a game. 

" seems the fans don't like 
league leaders, because the 
league's leading rebounder, 
Dennis Rodman, also isn't an 
All-Star. 

What about poor Tom 
Gugliotta? He is leading the 
Timberwolves in poi nt s and 
rebounds, yet it is Garnell that 
will represent the T' wo lves as 
an AII -Slar. I gue .. ~ Googs can 
take solace in the lact that he 
actually went to college. 

There also must be a stipula-
tion in the NBA AII - tar "man-
ual" that you have to play for a 
good learn to get nominated, So 
scratch Glenn Robinson off the 
li st. He" fourth in the league in 
coring, but he plays for the

BRING 'EM ON: The Tritons, who have been swimming very well lately again t Division I team , 
with a . olid meet at Arizona State and a win at USD, look ahead to Saturday ' big home meet 

By Jacob Gordon 
Staff Writer 

Di vision [II , the li llie di vision with the big hearl. 
The UCS D swimming team wi ll wage water-war th i ~ 
Saturday in the Di vision II[ hallenge here at 
Canyo nview Poo l. The Challenge is a huge evenl 
'involving all the lOp teams in Division Ill , incl udi ng 
Claremont and Pomona-Pilzer. 

CSD comes into thi s weekend 's meet on quite a 
ro ll. After a close meet against 
Ari zona Slate last weekend, the Triton 
swimmers brought it strong at the 
University of San Diego last Satu rday. 

The men fini shed first, while the 
women's team made a huge second-
half effort to take second. 

One of the reasons the UCSD 
women were down at the beginning of 
the second half was because they only 

have one di ver, Heather Willey. She perfo rmed va lianl-
Iy in the meet, however, placing third against the tough 
Division I competiti on. 

[n the 50- and lOO-yard freestyle and IOO-yard but-
tern y, Shawna Caba llero recorded the fastest times ever 
hy an unshaven swimmer in UCS D hislory. Kell y 
Byrne placed lirst in two events. the 200-yard freestyle 
and 200-yard breaststroke. Rebecca Arnold li nished a 
close second in the 200 hreastslroke and also fi nished 
second in the 100-yard hreastslroke. 

In the lina l evenl, the 200-yard freestyle relay, 
SO was behind when ahallero, Ihe anchor leg of 

Ihe relay, entered the poo l. She domi naled the race, 
placing the Tritons a close second behind USD. 

The men won eas ily in their meel against Cal State 
North ridge, a Di vision I program in transiti on. Overall , 
the Trilons swam very well hecause of their excell ent 
condit ioning. 

" II was great to see our swimmers fin ish as strong as 
they did," co-captain Lainie Hilaiel said. "We 've j usl 
made the transiti on in our trai ning from di stance to 
spri nts and all our hard work is obviously paying off."

Now Take a Deep Breath: Sophomore Rebecca Arnold is cruis ing through anothe r 
successful race , this one at a meet in Canyonview Pool earl ier th is season . 

The Challenge Ih is Saturday is the most exci ting 
meet of the year and will even include some other 
Tri ton athletes gelling their feet weI. There wi II he 
some inleresting pre-game festi vities, so come out and 
have a great time at the pool while you support your 
school.

doubleheader aga inst 

S Lo Angeles. 
That ' ri ght, the hardballers 

are back, armed with a new 
coach, a new attitude, some new 
recruits and definite postseason 

hopes. Dan 0 ' Brien has 
replaced Robert Fletcher al the 
helll) , and has instilled a differ-
ent attitude in hi s leam. 

"There's a 101 more energy on 
Ihe fi eld," O' Brien said , 
"[The players and r I 
have bonded togelher. 
We have great chem-
iSlry." 

First baseman Eri c 
Pangelinan ; second 
baseman Ken Fluharty; 
third baseman Rya n 
Hill ; 'hort stop Mark 

Mason; outfielders George 
Escanuelas David Myers, Jon 
Goldsmith and Eric Schramm ; 
catcher Gu lati ; and pitchers 
Michael Bedar, David Takehara, 

Theo Robins, Eddie Ishak and 
Yoshayah Gold fa rb were all very 
import ant cogs in lasl year's 
squad and are return ing to the 
field looking for a strong 19911 . 

This year, Ihe boys have a 
couple new additions: freshman 
Billy MacDougall , a promising 
out fie lder who wi ll get some at-
bals at designated hitter; teve 
Pelletier, a lransfer student who 
will 'ee time at both catcher and 
designated hitter; coil Jensen, a 
right-handed transfer from UC 
Davis who will get his innings; 
Jess Warrington, a redshirt 
catcher; and Mark Basterretche, 
a redshirt last season, who will 
be the team's only left-handed 
hurler.
