AS Presidential Candidates Each 
Find Opponent Unsatisfactory 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Writer 

"If he's just off-the-wall all the 
time, and if he wears his robe and 
party hat into the Chancellor's office 
to make a major decision, the AS 
could suffer a severe loss of 
credibility with the administration 
and especially the students . .. 
- Linda Sabo on Jeremy Charlton 

"I suppose if Linda's elected, 
she'll continue doing a lot of good 
things in Sacramento, like she did 
this year as External Affairs 
Commissioner. But the AS has a lot 
of problems I don't think Unda can 
correct. " 

- Ouu-Iton on Sabo 
The choice between the 

presidential candidates in tomorrow's 
AS nm-off election is as clear ~ it has 
ever been. Students can either choose 
Linda Sabo,linked by experience and 

politics to the current AS structure; or 
Jeremy Charlton, who wants to bribe 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu to 
keep Proposition 9 off the ballot. 

While "Very Silly Students" slate 
candidate Charlton dismisses 
disparity between his and Sabo's 
philosophies as "different priorities," 
Sabo, heading the "Student Interests 
Not Special Interests" slate, thinks it's 
a lot more than that. 

"The philosophies of Jeremy and 
. most of the other dedicated AS 
Council members are so widely 
different that if he gets elected, he 
might have a mass resignation on his 
hands," she threatens. 

Charlton maintains that "although 
I'D be quite silly at times, I won't 
ignore the traditional responsibilities"

'Unsupported Fund Transfers' 
Taint System; None at UCSD 

BY SAM GOOCH 
~te Newt Editor 

The University of California 
has been aaked to return $1.5 
million in federal grant money 
81 a result of a recent audit by 
the US Deparbnent of Health, 
Education and Welfare. 

HEW auditors had charged 
several UC campuses with 
unauthorized Ihuffling of 
research funds - including 
laiarieS - from one grant to 
another duri"8 the two-year 
period ending June 30, 1978. 

"UCSD W81 not cited by the 
HEW for any violationl in 
grant funding loHcy or 
procedure," sai campul 
Accounting Officer Frank 
Cvar. 

UCSD received an 
estimated $80 to $90 miUion 
in federal research allocationl 
duri"8 the two year audit 
p?riod, according to Harry 
Moore, UCSD Director of 
Contracts and Grants. 

"Even though there was not 
one instance of illegal funds 
transfeu at the San Diego 
campuI," said Moore, "the 
HEW charges severely 
discredit the university grant 
system as a whole." 

.. Although we can't .peak 
officially for the other 
campules," Cvar said, "we're 
pretty sure that fraud il not 
involved - no one is getting 
rich from federal grants." 

Rather, the alleged 
"unsupported fundi transferl" 
are probably due to 
ambivalent regulationl, 
inconclulive documentation 
and arbitrarily enforced or 
non- specific deadli nel, 
explained Moore. 

"Transfer of charges from 
one grant to another il 
common practice," said 
Moore. "Many projects are 
cloae.Iy related and, in general, 
criteria for tranlfeu il 
dependent on whether the 
tranlfer benefits the grant." 

According to Moore, 
probleml arise because of the 
enormous amonts of grant 
monies to be accounted for 
combined with the complexi-
ties of governmental 
regulations and documenta-
tion requirements. 

" And there is no indication 
that the auditors are trying to

Looking Into AS For Ourselves 
Editor: 

Well, it'. student election time again and 
... !dents .e gOing around trying 10 get people 
informed and then hopefuDy motivated enough 
to v.. It's funny how 10 many .tudents. 
whatever their motiviation, are willing to 
become candidates and go through four weeks =ping. Let's _, this year some 
elM are "progressive," some are out for 
"student interests" vs "colege interests" and 
aome are just plain "siDy." But what I can't 
fitan out is why they are all willing to go 
throuah with it. 

I mean really! What malces a "Linda Saba" 
type want to go through the dorms talking with 

students 'til I o'clock in the morning? Or a 
"Jeremy Charlton" type walk around in his bath 
robe or a "Warren Wheeler" type spend six 
weeks making sure that students get registered 
to vote? Well, a bunch of us decided to look into 
this AS stuff we've heard and read 10 much 
about. 

Here are a few of the things we found out: 
Let'. start from the beginning - the vote. As it 
turns out, for the past four years, UCSD has 
had the highest voter turnout in the entire UC 
.]stem, averaging between 25 and 33 percent 
(the 33 percent in 1978 being the second 
highest turnout in UC history).

T Wo statistical milestones were passed by U.S. prisons between 1975 and 1980. For the first time in the nation's

Write In Tambuzi 
Editor: 

During the recent AS'elections, the Progressive Coalition 
consistently brought before students our positions on the 
ilSues - and we are pleased that so strong a response was 
received. We thank those who supported us, and urge all 
students to vote for Progres.ive candidates in the run.off 
elections. 

In . addition, we ar~ urging stu~ent. to write·in Robert 
Cunrungham.TambUZI for AS President. Tambuzi waged a 
strong progressive compaign, and missed the run·offll by only 
2S votes - not bad in such a crowded race. 

It is important that progressives hold positions on the AS 
- especially with the dangers of Proposition 9 and the new 
Chancellor. We can not afford to risk our futures on a Silly 
Student, too much is at stake. 

Robert Cunningham.Tambuzi has strong experience with 
SAAC, with student organizations, and in organizing - skills 
that are necessary to resolve the problems that confront 
students. He was on of two progressive candidates in the 
recent elections - support him on May 6th. 

We also urge support for the Progresllive Coalition and 
Constructive Action Candidates remaining in the elections, as 
well as Bill T Qpkis. 

PROGRESSIVE COALITION 

Bekken Endorses 
Editor: 

With AS elections once more upon us, it is important that 
students concerned about ltudent issues - students who 
have a history of working in behalf of students - be elected. 
JuI~ ,Bagneris is such ~ person. I am. endorsing Jules for 
ActiVIty Fee Board Ch8JJ' because of hiS work with student 
organizations, and because of hill concern for their needs. 
Jules has the ability and experience necessary to make a good ' 
Activity Fee Board Chair. 

Reggie Williamll ill another candidate wOrthy of support. 
Over the past year I have worked with Reggie, who is running 
for ComrnilSioner of Student Welfare, on the Student 
Advocate Program. Reggie is concerned about the problem. 
that confront students -:- about the unfair grades, the 
bureaucratic harraument, the racism and sexism that are a 
part of the UCSD experience for 10 many students - and he 
has been working to resolve them. As Commiuioner 01 
Student Welfare, Reggie would advocate for ltudents both 
individuaiJlI and collectively. 

I lIro y urge all students to vote for Jules ris and 
Reggie i11iam., as wellas Alma Key (PubI~tions), 
Juan Torres (External Affiara), Bill Topkis (Vice President) 
and Robert Cunningham.Tambuzi (President - write.in).

Four Shot by Nat'} Guard at Kent State 
What Was It Like? What Does It Mean? Does Anyone Remember? Does Anyone Care? 

BY RICK GREENE 
Monday, May 4. 1970 

Allison Beth Krause felt warm sweat roll off her forehead and onto 
the oillow. She lay 

it few momerils, thinking about 
a nightmare, before she lazily 
swung her arm up and slapped 
at the clock-radio. The alarm 
stopped. A news announcer 
was speaking in a high, urgent 
voice . 

" . . . that c1as.es are 
scheduled as normal today. 
Governor Rhoades warned 
that all students are required to 
attend classes. The National 
Guard .. " 

Rick Greene aI/ended Kent 
State University from 1975· 
1.977 and is a Daily Guardian 
arts writer. Today marks the 
10th anniversary of the killing 
01 four students at Kent State. 

A1~son flipped the tuner and 
caught The Beatles in the 
midst of "Let It Be" which 
seemed to satisfy her. She lay 
on her back, stared at the 
ceiling and lilltened to a voice 
sing about his hour of 
darkness. She thought about 
the events of the past weekend 
and couldn't believe what a 
hole the campus had become. 
Nixon. Cambodia. That's 
what started it. 'They had to 
protest. 1bey had 10. If Nixon 
and Congress want to invade 
Cambodia, then let them go. 
Thi. is our country too. We 

have rights and we want 
peace. We don't want to kill 
and we11say so. We have the 
right to say 10. . 

But it went beyond that. 
Friday night lOme students 
rioted on Water Street. They 
broke store windows, ruined 
cars and fought in the middle 
of the street. Some gang had 
started it. Hundredl of 
lltudents, screaming, swearing 
and destroying. Because of 
Nixon. Because of Cambodia. 
1hen on Saturday they burned 
the ROTC building on 
campu •. When the fire was put 

out, IOmeone started it again 
and the building burned to the 
ground. Allison had watched it 
burn. 

Sunday the National Guard 
was caBed in. They read the 
riot ael over and over. Nixon 
and Cambodia were forgotten. 
Now it was the Guard. Get the 
Guard off campus! 'They 
clubbed the students with rifle 
butts and cut them with 
bayonets. They bombed them 
with tear gas and told them 
what to do and where to go. 
And the students rallied and 
protested and chanted. Allison

said. 

A1~son and Barry Levine 
had walked about the campus 
that Sunday, talking with 
friends about the Guard and 
the rally planned for noon on 
Monday. Governor Rhoades 
said the ltudents were worse 
than the Brown Shirts and that 
any means of force would be 
used to prevent the students 
from damaging the campus .

The National Guard Md

downtown Kent and back onlo 
campus. The many who 
violated the nine o'clock

gassed. AIliIOll and Barry, in 
an effort to see what wa 
happening, got caught in 'the 
mass of students and rushed 
for refuge in T rio Towers. She 
hated the tear gas. It stung and 
choked her. It was painful and 
unbearable. She vowed she 
would never gel involved in 
anything again where tear sa 
was used. Locked in the Tri· 
Towers lobby aU night, the 
students sat and ciscussed 
means of getting the Guard 08

The game began a bit 

unsteadily . Although UCSD 
allowed no runs in the first 
inning, they showed signs of 
confusion; the infielders 
bobbled routine grounders and 
were unable to get their throws 
off in time. 

In the bottom of the inning, 
UCSD shortsl<>p Sue Weinsoff 
was the first Triton to readi 
base safely , drawing a base on 
balls. She then began the 
profusion of Triton stolen 
bases - 16 in all - stealing 
second and third only to be left 
stranded as Betz flied out to 
end the inning. 

When the Tritons took the 
field for the second time, they 
retired Cal Lutheran's side in 
order. Their play turned very 
aggressive and it held for the

With still no ouls , Stacy 
McEvoy took the bat for 
UCSD, attempting to keep the 
on-base streak alive. She 
ripped a sland.up double 
which brought in two more 
UCSD runs. Jane Nowell drew 
a base-on-balls as WeinlOff 
stole home on a bad pitch. 
Betz then sacrificed to bring 
McEvoy home. 

For the second time in the 
inning, Herbert reached base 
safely and Nowell stole horne 
for the seventh and final run of 
the seemingly endless inning.

Although the intercollegiate 
season hal dosed, mo.t riders

race under USCF. Their next 
competition is in the Camp 

Pendleton Road Race next 
weekent. This race is 125, 75 
or 50 miles long, depending 
upon four different categories 
of riders. 

UCSD's Neil Bankston, 
Ben Young and coach Dean 
PalterlOn are all in the elite 
Category I. Most Triton 
cyclers are in Category II. 

The cydint team placed 
third in the We.tern Divi.ion 
Intercollegiate Championlhips 
laat weekend, marking the end 
of the intercoDelJiate seaaon. 
The athletes are now gearing 
up for state and national 
championships to be held later 
thi. month. 

The team waa able to take 
third place delpite being 
di.qualified from the time trials 
for drafting, a lactic of riding 
just behind lead racen and 
catching their .lipstream so 
they won't have to work as 
hard. 

Triton Audrey Thornton 
turned out the best 
performance, winning the 
women'l time trial by 45 
secondl. She left Kathy 
Swartz, a skilled rider from a 
strong Sanla Barbara team, 
behind in second place. 

This Week in Sports 

Although three teams were 
involved in what the officials 
term unfair play, UCSD wa. 
the only team to be 
di.qualified. 

Based on this latest effort, 
Thornton ihinks she hal a 
good chance of -plaCing in the 
national races in a few monthl,

Doinel is stiD a child and wiD

artistry has achieved a level of 
maturity and cohesiveness not 
apparent in other films. His 
skill as a narrator is 
extraordinary here, as he 
attempts to weave his various 
Doinels into a coherent story. 
The devices he used to this end 
often involve outlandish 
coincidence (his old flame 
Colette (Piaier) just happens to 
be a lawyer present at Doinel's 
divorce, just happens to be 
travdling on the same train), 
but never do the characters 
lose their own identities or lives 
to suit the plot.

Minorities More Likely Sabo 
To Get Put In Prison Serious 
Con'inued from 1Xl!le 2 
criminologist Erik Olin Wright 
estimated that 25 to 30 
percent of Black men in their 
early Twenties will spend time 
in prison. The rate for White 
men in that same age group is 
approximately seven percent. 

But, maintains, criminolo· 
gist Michael Hindelang, "Too 
many people for too long have 
said that the only thing that 

. accounts for the higher arresl 
rate of Blacks is discrimina· 
tion. Hindelang believes that 
Blacks simply commit more 
oHenaea - and he hili 
completed a study of more 
than eight million incidenta of 
robbery, rape and . assault 
which showl them to be 
di.proportionately involved in 
nearly all categories of 
personal crime. 

Other. claim diacrimination 
is central to that very problem. 
"Crime il a matter of 
opportunity , " ob.erves 
William Nagel, a former 
prison official who heads the 
American Foundation 
Institute of Corrections. 
"Bankers and people with 
large expense accounts do not 
commit street crimes. The 
opportunity for Blacks in 
crime is more limited and they 
commit ones for which they 
are more likely to be 
prosecuted, convicted, and 
sent to jail." 

"There's a greater 
likelihood that you'll go to 

prison if you have a juvenile 
record," adds Michigan State 
Appellate Defender Jim 
Newhard. "And thanks to the 
economic and social problems 
which cause their families to 
deteriorate around them , 
many young Blacks get into 
trouble when they are kids . 
Later on they simply graduate 
into the felony system. When 
they become adults, they are 
apt to be written off as 
unsalvageable, given harsh 
sentences, and put on the shelf 
. . " In prrson. 

Many studies support 
Newhard's charge . In 
Georgia, the number of Blacks ' 
serving more than 30 years is 
more than double the number 
of Whites. An anaIysi. of 
lentence lengths in Michigan 
last year .howed that in mo.t 
categories of oHenaea, Blacks 
conaistently received longer 
lentences. A lUl'Vey 01 six 
southern states turned up 
evidence of similar sentencing 
differences. 

According to Newhard, the 
same problems which mean 
stiff sentences for non·whites 
reduce their chances for early 
release. "Parole boards ask 
whether or not an app~cant 
was raised in a fatherless 
home, if he had a job, a stable 
marriage or a marketable skill. 
From beginning to end, the 
criminal justice system favors 
articulate, well-educated, well-
groomed - and White -
defendanta."

Body President's Council, 
Linda has worked with 
students on all UC campuses 
to inform the legislature of 
student disapproval of this 
proposition and suggest 
alternatives. 

In recent testimony before 
the Regenta, Linda pointed out 
that, "To tear down a 112· 
year·old traditioo of tuition-
free higher education in 
Califomia would be gro .. ly 
irrespon.ibly, unless all other 
options for filling the revenue 
gap created by financial

examined, tested, and 
rejected. " 

While aerving on the AS

many on-campua cootrover·

wasting their energies on petty

Linda could continue to lead

Checking Out AS 
Shows Real Needs 
Continued from page 2 

The second thing we looked 
at was why are 10 many 
people voting? Well , 

for starters, the AS COuncil is 
responsible for allocating dose 
to $200,000 in Activitiy Fee 
monies. This year, dose to 75 
percent of those monie. went 
to student orga.nizations , 
student media (KSDT, New 
'ndicator, Hemist>here, Voz 
Fronteriza) and student 
programs (SCURI, ASIO· 
SHIP), Oh, and the co-opa too 
(Record Co-op, Food Co-op), 
but don't get excited, there was 
a time when "lludent leaders" 
(lie) used to tpend monies on 
.iOy thing. like 'P8fh~tti 
dinnera (1975) and hiring 
three girIfrienda for secretaries 
(l971). Check it out! b'. all in 
the files. Juat spend a few 
hour. IooImg it up in the 
Student AHaira &lea - it'. all 
there, but we figwe moat 01 
you .-e too buay to do that. 
And that'. cool becauae we 
know that moat 01 UI are juat 
here to get into Meet School. 
So we thought we'd look some 
of this atuH over. 

A few more things: the 
Student Center Board haa a . 
$300,000 budget, pays for 
EDNA'., Co-ap's, allocates 
space to organizations, helped 
get the pub on campus, etc. 
Well, anyway, the AS 
appoints the .tudenta who ait 
on that board. Again, it didn't 
need to be like that. We didn't 
even have a Student Center 

until 1974 and it W8I run by 
administrators until 1977 
when the .tudents took it over . 

But that'. no big deal , 
.tudents at UCLA, Be-keley, 
Davis, Santa Barbara run the 
bookstore.! (Which i. 
probably why their profit 
margins are lower than ours.) 

O.K. So much for the put, 
how about the future? There'. 
a good chance we" have a 
$1,500 a year tuition plus 
program cuta next year. 

- There'. a new chancelor 
coming in who's going to 
reorganize the whole place. 
Thi. could benefit studenta, 
maybe not. 

- There'. a d ... ·action 
luit against UC for not 
meeting federal Affirmative 
Action requirernenta. 

- Three .tudenh 
commiHed auicide lut. year. 
Next year a new record? 

- We have a 70 percent 
attrition rate. 

- We've had food poi. 
soning in the cafeterias. 

- We've had .tudenta 
"arrested" (or is it molested?) 
for posting student organiza. 
tion advertisements. 

I guess what we're trying to 
get acroll is that it appears 
thai it does make a diHerence 
who gets elected and who 
doesn't. 

There wiD be some very 
critical illues facing students 
next year - more than ever

Tri-Tower. before the Guard cornered them with 
more tear .... Her hair was dirty and it ameIIed bad 
from the gas but there wasn't time to wash it~ust 
enouch to Jrab a quick lunch and meet Barry. Then 
they would proceed to the Victory Bell for the noon 
rally_ A,.uy which would protest .trongly agaillit the 
Gu.rd. But it wouldbe"peaceful. Peace was the only " 
way to get rid of the Guard. 

More than one thouaand .tudenll, perhaps fifteen 
hundred, covered the commons in the vicinity of the 
Victory BeD. The bell was ringing. The lOund 
brought more .tudenll. They were the interested,the 
curioua, the protesting and the angry. The troop. and 
police, auernbled with gal mask. and rifles nearby, 
made no move to prevent the gathering. The crowd 
acreamed and jeered. They apit and awore and 
chanted and grew larger. 

AIlilOn and Barry .tood and waited for IOmeone to 
Itart apeaking, to bring order to the-crowd. They 
were surrounded, in the thick of the studenll. 

"Thi. it incredible!" shouted Allison. " 
"Damn right" laid Barry. 
The aun was bright and warm, a beautiful spring 

day. The National Guard stood off to the left and 
watched. The" jult watched. 

"Co home!' IOmeone .houted. 
The Guard moved. They had been ordered to 

break up the crowd. It was getting too large. The rally 
had been prohibited, anyway. Didn't the.e kid. know 
the)' were under Martial Law? 

An officer read the riot act. .. Attention. This i. an 
order. Desperae immediately. Thi. i. an order. Leave 
thia area immediately. Thi. i. an order." Nobody

n.e Guard planned to aemi-aurround the .tudenll 
and drive them back acrOil the common. and over 
Blanket Hill. Then they would maneuver the .tudenll 
back into a practice football field, pelt them with tear 
gal and break them up. The Guard moved. It was 
noon. 

Cani.ler. of tear ga. were IIhot into the hoard of 
ltudenll and they ran toward Blanket Hal. The 
troops advanced in one long, .ingle-file line. Allison

. near a fence, out of tear gas. The aun beat down, 
cursing and screaming. The Guard began to regroup. 
They started to ascend Blanket Hill. One squad 
dropped on one knee, riflea in the ready position. 
More rocks. Sweat, anger, Cambodia, riot, rifles . 

AmlOn saw the Guard kneeling. Not real, she 
tho~ht. 

"They won't fire" said Barry. 
They fired. 
First, there was a single ahot. 1he precise, sound-

slicing crack of the shot momentarily saenced the 
ltudents. Two full seconds PUsel, then the volley 
began. For eight seconds the National Guard shot 
into the roup of studenll on Blanket Hill. 

"They re .hootina'" lCI'eamed Barry as he dove 
onto the asphalt near a parked car. AIIi~n ran, 
hearing again and again the nearby explo.ions from 
the rines and not believing what she heard. Why 
would they shoot at u.? We're just .tudenll. Why 
would anyone shoot at Iludents of Kent State 
University? 

AllilOn felt a warm hot .hove at her left side which 
crathed her onto the gravel of the parkins lot. 
Something hard had burned into her ribs and chest, 
and her heart was raw and cracked. She lay on her 
back, silend), breathing fast and feeling hot white and

Peace. Echos of explosions. Stop it' 
"An ambulance will be here lOOn" said somebody 

far away. 
The Guard had retreated. Some were appalled. 

Some surrounded fallen bodies. One student jumped 
up and down in blood. There was shock, outrage, 
IOrrow. Some screamed . Most were quiet. 

Allison opened her eyes but didn't see. Her lungs 
slowed, the ache too much, the pain too terrible. She 
was twisted and mushed. Her lips were cold and 
dark. She trembled. Barry held her hand as she died. 
Allison Beth Krause died in a parking lot. 

Part Two 
Wednesday, May 1977 

A light drizzle leaked acro.. the Kent State 
University campus and a mild wind whipped the 
drizzle through the trees and acro .. the dulf orange 
buildings. Everything was wet and soft and dirty. The 
rain, combined with the typical iron-gray Ohio sky, 
made the day seem especially dreary but the date on 
the calendar held a special significance to each 
person on campus which filled that Wednesday with 
a quiet and old horror. It was seven years to the day 
that four KSU studenll were slain and nine wounded 
in what had become widely known as "The Kent 
State Tragedy". 

Somewhere around eleven o'clock that morning I 
pushed away my blankets, scowled at the rain dotlina 
my window and got dressed. I was interested to 
observe the mood of the people on campus. For 
weeks all anyone talked about was the May 4th 
Coalition, their plans to honor the dead on May 4th, 
the big protest about tearing down Blanket Hill to put 
up a new gym and the way all the Coalition members 
set up tents on the hill and wouldn't budge for weeks. 

I wasn't really sure just how I felt about the Kent 
State tragedy. I didn't understand it and I wasn't 
really sure what had happened that day. Some say 
that the National Guard was justified in sho~ng,

There are no detectable

the most sophisticated ana ..

Here's why: Some years ago, 
as part of a continuing effort 
to make the best beer possible, 
we instituted an unconven ..

Coors has a tradition of

Kent State: Sad 
Memories Remain 

Continued (rom page 16 
It bothered me that four 

innocent students had been 
killed for nothing . Four 
students who once attended 
classes I did, walked around 
the campu. I belonged to, 
~ved in the dorm. I tived in, ate 
and slept and learned and 
laughed in the same places 
that I did all those things. But 
they were dead and I wasn't. 
This I couldn't understand or 
accept. 

I couldn't understand their 
world. A world of protests and 
violence, of demonstrations 
and sit.ins, of peace signs and 
Viet.Nam. I never knew the 
students or their families or 
histories. I don't know what 
ther thought about or believed 
in. only knew they were dead. 
They were murdered on my 
campus seven years earlier in 
a parkinll lot I croued every 
day. And'thi. made me angry. 

Senselell death alway, 
makes me anwy, but this 
really scared and haunted me. 
Who were they? Why did they 
die? What was the reason? 
Somewhere were four graves 
which read JeHery Glenn 
Miller; Allison Beth Krause, 
William K. Schroeder and 
Sandra Lee -SCheuer. Graves 
which should have been 
empty . 

I walked' through the T ri-
Towers lobby and out into the 
drizzle . There weren't many 
people around. The May 4th 
Coalition had tried to get 
daslel cancelled for the day to 
honor the dead but the 
admini.tration wouldn't do it. 
Most of the students didn't 
care so much. It was a long 
time ago. 

The 
like . cold drOps felt 

. my 

face . I could see the thick 
pmars of Taylor Hailioorning 
up in the di,tance, defying the 
cold and the rain. There were 
people in the parking lot in 
front of Taylor. As I walked 
nearer I could see they weren't 
students. These were old, very 
old people. 

ground. I felt their pain and I 
felt their loss, but more that 
anything, I felt anger. 

They were standing inside 
of small, roped off sections. 
These were isolated people, 
unmoving and unspeaking. 
All was silent. Only the rain 
made noise, quietly striking 
earth . The people were 
dressed i.l black and gray. 
They wore hats and held dark, 
wet umbrellas. I walked into 
the middle of the parking lot 
and stared_ Who were they? 

I approached one group. 
There was a man, perhaps in 
his fifties . He looked sad. Next 
to him stood a woman, 
clutching his arm with her 
black gloves , staring at the 
ground. They stood behind the 
ropes and waited. "I11ere was a 
.ign on the rope. It read 
'Altison Krause'. 

Allison Krause died on that 
spot. The man was her father . 

His shoulder. were sagged 
and the rain battered hi. face 
yet he didn't move and he 
didn't see. I looked into his 
eyes, brown eyes, and law a 
deep and old pain, a pain 
reaching back seven year.. I 
saw him crying. Why does 
death have to hurt 10 much for 
so long? He didn't have a 
daughter anymore. His 
da~h~ was dead. 

He stood and wept and 
remembered his Allison. His 
wife just clutched and sighed. 
The rain made the ink in the

There were others. Parents , 
brothers and sisters of victims, 
standing a one day vigil. So 
many had forgotten , but not 
them. They would never 
forget. Nor would I. 

The rain kept falling and still 
nobody moved or spoke and I 
knew they would be back next 
year and the year after thaI. I 
felt myself crying and I was 
glad I was crying_ It was 
important. What had 
happened at Kent state was 10 
important. A glistening wet 
parking lot full of people 
standing on the spots where 
their sons and daughters had 
died was important. 

Inside each roped off death 
spot was a candle. A buming 
candle. It amazed me that , 
even in the rain, the four 
candles were still burning. 
Even in the rain, the candles 
would not go out. I hope they 
never go out. 

As I left the parking lot that 
afternoon I brought with me a 
pain and an anger I can still 
feel . And, perhaps, a hope. A 
hope that, as tragic and 
agonizing as it was, that it 
wasn't for nothing . A 
realization that I know and 
love tho~ four people. I am 
those four people. We all are. 
And tho.e who cannot 
recognize this are the real Kent 
State tragedy. 

There is leamin, in pain.
