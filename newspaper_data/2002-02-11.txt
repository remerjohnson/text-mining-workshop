. The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraterni-
ty hosted its first Hunger Banquet 
in the Price C enter Ba ll room on 
Thursday night to ask for the sup-
port o f the Jewish. commu nity 
outside UCSD. 

Last week, the fra tern ity spon-
sored the Hunger Relief campaign 
on campus, which included a 56-
hour bike-a-thon. 

The combined effort of both 
events raised money for Mazon, 
an organization t hat allocates 
donations from the Jewish com-
lIlunity to nonprofit organizations 
providing food and help to hungry 
people of all fait hs and back-
~round s. 
, This year, the banquet and the 
bike-a-thon raised about $7 ,000, 
IllOTe t han double what the frater -
niry ra ised last yea r. 

The se mi -fo rmal banquet 

included a kosher catered dinner 
and seve ral speakers, with 
addresses by California State Sen. 
Dede Alpert and U .S. 
Congresswoman Susan Davis . 

About 75 people attended the 
event. Tickets were $65 for adu lts 
and $40 fo r child ren . All of the 
proceeds benefited Mazon . 

Davis, who spoke via video 
message, said that the fraternity's 
efforts have dual importance. 

"Not o nl y are yo u rais ing 
money, but you are also sending a 
message of compassio n and action 
to others," she said. 

Alpha Epsi lon Pi President 
Lance Miller echoed her senti-
ments. 

"More than the money [we 
raise), how we get things done and 
the awareness it provides is just as 
- if not m ore - importa nt," he 
·aid. "For four days the center o f 
UCSD is focused on philanthropy

A imilar referendum at 
Eleanor Roosevelt College that 
would have c reated a Roosevelt 
student fee of $5 per quarter 
recen tl y failed by eight votes . 

The referendums were put on 
the ballot to expand the pro-
gramming offered at each col-
lege, according to each college 's 
council chair. 

i\-luir's referendum, which was 
voted on two weeks ago and will 
double Muir College Council's 

budget, will rake etTen in fall 
2002. Roosevelt's referendum 
was voted on three weeks ago. 

ulThe referendum's failure] 
defi nitely limits the amount of 
programming we can do and type

Roosevelt College Council C hair 
D avid Goodwin . " [Srudents] 
potentially were not aware o f the

. "The money would go to thc

stated. "Right now, we are just

III determine what students want, 
>0 not hi ng is set in stone yet." 

But not all colleges arc consid-
crlng sponsoring fcc referendums. 

\\'arren College Counci l Chair 
Jesse Coward said the idea of a 
\ \'arrcn referendum had nOI come 
lip. 

"'''e've actually had almost 
extra money at the end of the year 
that wc need to spend," Coward 
s:lid . " \Vc haven't traditionall y 
done I a rgcr-scal e programs." 

' Varren students pay 11'0 activity 
fcc, so ,,v3rren programming is 
funded cntirely by vending 
lIlacl11nC profits and the A.S. 
Coullcil, according to Coward. 

"' Ve generally put on a lot of 
programs throughout the year," 
'oward said. " I think part of [the 

reason there is not a Warren refer-
endulll] may be that we're the 
largest col lege, so first of all, we 
get Inure ITl oney." 

Each college counci l receives 
IIlllncy from the A.S. Counci l pro-
portional to each college'S popula-
tion, and each council also receives 
a portion of vending machine prof-
its. 

''''arren Coll ege Council 
Treasurer Marcus Lee said that the 
A.S. Council allocated $14,478 to 
the \Varrcn council this academic 
year. By contrast, Muir received 
$11,950 frolll A.S. 

Luw voter turnout has charac-
terized m;II1Y past college elections 
hut both Muir and Roosevelt were 
able to breach the 15 percent 
mark, which va lidates an election. 

Voter tllfnout for Roosevelt's 
referendum, which was done elec-
tronica lly th rough StudentLink, 
was over 20 percent according to 
Roosevelt Dcan of Student Affairs 
Patricia eott. It failed, 210-202. 

The Muir referendum had a 
turnout of "roughly 18 percent of 
Muir College's winter quarter 
enrollmcnt," with 434 students VOt-
ing for the fee increase and 223 5111-
dents voting against it, according to 
Muir Dean Charles Dreilinger.

BRIEFLY 
Anthropology professor honored by NAS 

Roy D'Andrade of the anthropology department 
was recently honored by National Aci4demy of 
Sciences for his contributions to science over the last 
10 years. 

Awarded for excellence in scientific reviewing. 
D'Andrade was selected by the NAS for his work merg-
ing the fields of anthropoloS}' and psychology. He was 
also cited for his "insightful Interpretations of historical 
trends shaping the future goals of anthropology." 

D'Andrade, who received a $10,000 prize for his 
contributions. was one of 14 individuals selected by 
NAS for honors. NAS has presented the award, which 
was established by Annual Reviews Inc., the Institute 
for Scientific Information, and the Scientist :n Honor of 
J. Murray Luck, annually since 1979. 

D'Andrade has been a professor at UCSD for 22 
years. 

UCSD biologists find first genetic 
evidence of animal evolution 

The first genetic evidence showing major changes 
to the body shapes and body plans of animals has 
been discovered by UCSD biologists. 

The research, which is scheduled to be published 
in the journal Nature, shows how mutations in the 
genes of crustaceans and fruit flies arose from aquat-
ic crustacean-like arthropods that ended up growing 
limbs. Thus, over 400 million years, sea creatures 
developed into six-legged insects. 

Biology professor William McGinnis led the project, 
which counters the creationist argument that evolu-
tion is a fallacy because the lack of a genetic mecha-
nism could not allow for animals to evolve with vastly 
different body plans. 

Matthew Ronshaugen and Nadine McGinnis con-
tributed to the research. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development funded the research. 

UCSD speech and debate team 
reaches final in tournament 

Eddy Shyu and Philip Littlewood took fifth place in 
the novice division at the 2002 Sunset Cliffs Classic 
Speech and Debate Tournament held last weekend at 
Point Loma Nazarene University. 

The duo won four of six preliminary debates to 
advance to the final round. which included eight 
teams. In the finals round they defeated Vanguard 
University and Carleton College by judges' decisions 
of 2-1. • 

Their run ended against the Air Force Academy 
with a 3-0 defeat while debating "Justice Delayed is 
Justice Denied~ 

Six teams from the speech and debate club partic-
ipated in the tournament, which served as preparation 
for nationals held to be next month in Colorado. 

UCSD undergraduates to show 
research in state capital 

UCSD undergraduate students Timothy Barder and 
Etienne Pelaprap were recently selected to present 
their research at a UC Day luncheon in Sacramento 
next month. 

Barder, of the chemistry department, will present 
"Synthesis and Fluorescence Studies of Aryl-
Substituted Bipyridines and Terpyridines:' 

Pelaprap of the co~nitive science department will 
present 'User ActiVity Histories and Multiscale 
Visualizations.' Their respective faculty advis.ers will co-
present the research with them. 

The UC Office of Research sponsors the competi-
tion to highlight undergraduate research efforts 
throughout the UC system. 

UC Day, held March 19, seeks to prepare UC stu-
dents for future careers in California's high-tech econ-
omy.

The commercialization of 

campus eateries stultifies the masses 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The readers who are aware of Illy Italian 
ancestry may think thar my dismay at the 
openi ng of :1 Rubio's Baja Grill in the Price 
Center has purely culinary origins. 

This, I must say, is not true. Ir is true 
that Rubio's belongs to that class of so-
ca lled re taurant - with an altogether 
roo liberal use of the term - the food 
quality of which varies from the bland to 
the inedible, being usually closer ro rhe 
latter than to the former. 

An establishment IIsi ng the slogan "True 
Baja" should not give its customers "burri-
tos" (they are an American ill\'ention, never 
found in any Mexican kitchen outside Cabo 
or CaJleon), while neglecting typical Baja 
California treats such . a eoctel de 
camarones or tile delicious ceviche. 

[ tried a Rubio's restaurant once, and 
since then, I'd ratller skip lunch than go 
there again - a choice made fortunately 
unnece saty on campus by the good soups 
of the Grove Caffe and the sambousas of the 
Food Co-op. 

While all these things are true, they are 
not the reasons I believe that Rubio's, 
Wendy's or ubway hould disappear from 

the Price Center. After all, if people want to 
spend their lunch hO\l!" eating bad-tasting, 
loul-smelling food, they should be free t" 
do so. 

What worries me is that opcnin" an(lrh-
er franchise in tllt: already heavily curporate.: 
Price Center is but a si gn of how Illuch the 
llniver'ity culture has disappeared. [(1 be.: 
replaced by yet another mirror of the dom-
inant business culture. 

The collUSIon between un iversity and 
corporate interests is particularly evidcnt at 
a campus like UCSD , but it is by no means 
restricted to this ca III pus. 

Our cuuntry h3;, emhracl!d the I(le't tlur 
the bu iness world is an ethical model for 
society to which all other mndcb should 
conform or be crushed. These days, one 
hears even religious authorities spe:iking in 
terms of m:trkets :Ind market pportunities. 
The only po sible relation between the citi-
zens and the organizations that decide so 
much of their lives is liS employees or as cus-
tomers. 

Once we acknowledge that lIniversiti (!s 
have abided to the market as an ethical 
model, it follows logically that they will 
direct their efforts to train the next gener-

I.i Let me just say first 
that the Arabs are differ-
ent from the Persians, 
but they're all Osama 
bin Laden people:' 

I flinch ed as if I had been 
punched when I heard this at the 
San Di ego Investig:ltor meeting 
nearly tluee weeks ago. 

I was speechless because the per-
son who said it was an FBI agent. It 
wasn't just an ordinary FBI agent, 
but a special agent in charge of the 
San Diego Division of the FBI, one 
who has overseen 500 other agents 
in the continued investigation into 
the Scpr. II rerrorist attacks. 

Almost i Illmcdi a tely, my 
snlll ncd, speechless disbelief turned 
into OllU"age as the man's hateful 
words sunk in. 

All Anbs and Persians are 
"0 ama bin Laden people"? 

,\1y father is Persian, and some of 
my friends are Arab and Persian. 
Thus we all must be, without a 
doubt, a part of Osama bin Laden's 
nerwork of terrorists. 

Apparently, no proof or hard evi-
dence is required; just take :l look at 
a person's etl1l1ic background, and 
tllat should be enough to convict 
entire races of being terrorists and 
traitors. 

As ll1uch as tile FBI special :tgenl 
helicved he was stating a fact, he was 
not. It was hate, fear ancl raci m 
speaking. Yct because of tile respect-
ed sranlre of this FBI special agent. H 
tatement as racist and erroneous as 

the one he made can have horrible 
ami far-re:lChing consequences.

ation of employees and cus-
tomers - we have seen that, in 
business ethics, these are the 
only two categories of being for a 
person. I n this framework, open-
ing fas t-food franchises in the 
Price Center makes sense from at 
least (hree angles. 

First, it is a profitable business 
move - a fast-food chain can pay 
a rent that a student co-op cannot 
- and as such, it consolidates the 
role of the university as a player in 
the business arena, though this is 
further removed from any pre-
tense of fostering scholarship and 
culmre. 

Second, it marginalizes stu-
dents and helps affirm that stu-
dent co-ops should be eliminat-
ed, not only becausc they repre-
sent a poli tical space out of uni -
versity control , bur also because 
they ~epresent a dangerous alter-

an extremely lefti st, highly politi-
cal society of ga rden -growing 
activists that protest the construc-
tion of storage sheds while fight-
ing for dozens of progressive caus-
es - which is perfectly fine, 
except that it calls itself a cafe. 
Cafes usually serve food more 
often than protesting for living 
wages for janitors. As a result, the

native to the university's business 
model. The various attempts by 
the administration to shut down 
student co-ops while offering 
generous advantages to food 
chains should be read in this con-
text. 

Finally, the presence of fast-
food chains in the heart ofUCSD 
is instrumental to training Snt-
dents in the "fast food culture," a 
term that is not limited to food, 
but that describes a culture of 
quantity over quality and of con-
formity over individuality. 

Fast-food chains are the epito-
me of this culture, not only in 
their relations with the ir cus-
tomers - characterized by large 
quantities of poor-quality food -
but also in the relations with their 
employees: underpaid, easily 
replaceable, and prevented by the 
laws of corporate image 10 show 
any hint of individuality. 

"''hat can one do' Recent his-
tory has shown that traditional 
means of political action arc inef-
fective against market ethics 
because the market will only 
assimilate the action and use it for 

Che Cafe cannot ' be accurately 
described as a restaurant in the 
conventional sense. 

The Food Co-op actually con-
centrates on selling good food, if 
you like nuts, berries and tig bars, 
which I do. However, like practi-
cally every co-op in the Student 
Center, it does not take TritonPlus 
or credit cards, which is exceed-
ingly annoying (or on-campus res-
idents and those who do not carry 
cash everywhere. Most co-ops, 
witll the exception of the Genera I 
Store, do not accept credit cards 
beouse of the fees associated with 
their use. 

According to sources within 
the co-ops, they don 't honor 
TritonPlus because of moral 
objections to the heg-emonic 

its own purposes. 
The only option is to reject the 

our role as consumers. Refuse to 
patronize fast food chains at 
UCSD. Bring your food from 
home; if nothing else, it will be 
much better for your health than 
the bundles of preservatives that 
these restaurants throw at you, 
and in the long run, your ta te 
buds might even revive. 

If you don't want to do that, go 
to a student co-op and buy some 
decent food - you will be sur-
prised how different it is - or go 
to Porter's Pub to drink a good 
beer instead of gulping down bub-
bly, brownish sodas. 

If you don't want to go to a co-
op because you believe that those 
guys are just a bunch of commies, 
fine. Patronize capitalism the way 
it is supposed to be done: Buy 
from a small business, a place you 
can walk into and talk to the 
owner rather than an underpaid 
employee without any decisional 
power. Buy frolll a placc in which 
individuality still wins over the 
uniformity of the large chains. Be 
a good capitalist and favor people 

administration and the difficulties 
students have in withdrawing 
funds from TritonPlus accounts. 

Although the reasoni ng behind 
that policy is understandable, it is 
nevertheless an inconvenience. 
The co-ops operate at their own 
pace, without the managerial hier-
archy found in for-prolit corpora-
tions. 

Without the hi erarchy, things 
tend to move lowly. The lo ng 
lines at Groundwork Books and 
the inadequate se rvice at the 
Food Co-op are side d"fects of 
the student cooperative,' strong-
Illindedness and high sense of 
11100'ali ty. 

The co-ops hav" li ttle to fear

\Nhat worries lIle is that the 
battle against the cOll1merciali z.l-
tion at UCSD is fought on a con-
stantly retreating front. Now wc 
are debating what should go into 
the Price Center, qnd we aren't 
even remembering the promises 
of a cuI tural center or of mure Snt-
dent pace that were Imde when 
the center was built. Students 
come and go and have little hi;lUr-
ical memory, while the admini,-
tration remains. 

We Illust rejcct this wave 01 
oblivion and have the cOllrag-e to 
bring back the discourse to where 
it should be: to the nurturing role 
of the university in a democratic 
society. 

The opening of Rubiu 's in tht: 
Price Center is not, of course, [he 
ca use of any of these probkms. It 
is, howc, cr, a symptom a nd as a 
s}'l11prom it should be fought. It i~ 
al\\'ays the S~~llpIOI1l S that ulti-
matel y cause de.nh. 

from the food sold by Price 
Center businesses that th~ two arc 
not really in competition. 
Discerning students wanting an 
on-campus job still appreciate the 
flexible hours and relatively high 
pay rates of tile student co-ops, 
despite the prcsence of corporate 
chains on campus. 

The only threat to the Cll-UPS

Column: 
FBI agent's comments 
might encourage racism 
Continued from page 5 

The worst of mose consequences 
would be if others believed him. 
Beca use of his impressive creden-
tials and the leadership role he plays, 
it is not too far-fetched to mink tha t 
he could be believed. 

Racism breeds fear and hysteria. 
It is conceivable mat what follows 
\\'ould resemble me Salem witch 
hu nts or me days preceding the 
Japanese-Americans' internment 
duri ng World War fl. 

What followed scared m e, 
sturU1ed me and turned my stomach 
completely. In a chain reaction, the 
agent's statement prompted the oth-
ers participants - who belonged to 
the FBI, CIA, law enforcement and 
militaty - to share meir racist sto-
ries and suspicions of anyone of 
Arab or Persian descent, and how 
the agents immediately reported 
them to the FBI. As I listened, I 
could find no basis in fact or truth . 
Their comments were fueled by 
nothing more man racist belie!;; and 
fears . 

Some might argue mat the agent 
just spoke without minking, or that 
his quote was taken Out of context. 
Let me refute any doubts so that 
there can be no question mat racism 
lives inside the FBI, especially with-
in the. investigation into the Sept. II 
terrorist attacks. 

That all Persians and rabs are 
.. sama bin Laden people" was th e 
agents preface to his update on the 
investigation into the Sept. I I 
attacks. 

To be fair, the special agent 
immediately made the following 
statement after his first one: "No 
offense. to those of that back-
ground." Then the agent cO.ntinued 
to debrief th e other member about 
the ranis of the investigation: which 
religious organiz:Jtions in San Diego 
are funneling mOlley to ,\lu~lillls 
and to Afghanistan . 

I have no doubt mat the r.leist 
statement was completely genuine 
and utterly serious. It was spoken as 
fact and was accepted as fact by the 
law enforcement officials at the 
meeting . 

There is a problem in the FBI if 
one of its specia l agents is blatandy 
racist. It brings up the question as to 
whether me FBI is conducting a 
witch hunt, completely disregarding 
me human rights of d1e people of 
Middle Eastern descent. 

Some might say that what one 
agent thinks or believes will not 
have mu~h of an impact on me FBI 
or its investigations. I so'ongly dis-
agree. 

A special agent in charge has 
enormous control over the leads 
mat are investigated, me decisions 
concerning whom people to arrest, 
detain and deport, and the direction 
of the investigation. 

I fear that the investigation into 
terrorist activities by the an 
Diego branch of the FBf has been 
compromised , and the investiga-
tion has turned into nou1ing morc 
thari a witch hunt fo r people of 
Arab and Persian de cem. I t is 
clear to me that fairness and 
impartiality have been compro-
mised by u1e raci st beliefs of mat 
particular FBI agent. . 

Something even carier: 
Consider how many FBI agellts 
have si miL~r beliefs to that special 
agem. It is il1lpos~ihlc to know lil(" 
ccrtai n, because racism is not, IIlC-
thing to which most people will 
readily admit. 

The fact U1at this agent dldn 'ttr)" 
to eli guise or hide his rHcist beliefs 
scares tile further. ""hat is in store 
for those of Middle Eastern 
descent? Will we be t1u'OI n inro 
internment camps like the Japanese 
during World War D, or will we JUSt 
be thrown into prisons, detained 
indefinitely? 
. Look at the news: lnc roundup

The intent behind changes to 
the resolution was to embracc the 
di\'ers ity of opi ni on of UC D Stu-
dents. Regardless of politi cs, the 
011L: thing on which we all agree is 
that we give our love and support 
to those who are fighting and to 
those who died in the tragedy of 
Sept. II . [n this resolution, we 
promi se th e men and women who 
di ed that they did not do so in 
vain and that we will never forget 
the Ie sons we have lea rned. The 
resollilion is not a "waste of 
paper," but rather a heartfelt con-
dolence and support for American 
\·icti ms. 

T he origi nal version of the res-
olution did not serve the interests 
of the student body. After taking a 
vote among the senators who 
would pass it in its ori ginal form , it 
was de:lr mat th e resolution would 
not pass, bec:llIse it did not serve to 
unite us. 

r am proud of m e A.S . Council 
for bei ng so a [tuned to the stu-

Americans who died and who arc 
Eghting is both hypocritical and

th:n one supports America and 
unity in the country. and then to 
rip Jpart o ne's fellow students, 
who are doing everything they 
can [0 suppOrt the causes of unity 
and pride. 

\Vhen I ran for oHice on the

that we care about. As· a leader o n

in every possible way. The amend-

As a student , I am proud that 
our student govern ment takes all 
sides into account. I am proud 
that our student government cares 
about all students on our campus 
and works every day to represent 
as many interests as possible. I am

that many statements were repeats 
of old state ments with only a few 
words ~ h a nged around, many of 
them were simply offensive and 
inflammatory. 

A couple of ideas that were 
parti cularl y offensive to me ran 
along the lines of, "Freshm en are 
not ready for the responsibility of 

living in an apartmcnt atmos-
phere, " and ",\1 antiatOry IIIcal 
plan are good for freshmen 
because they cannot cook for 
thcmselvcs." .

couldn't consider myself more 
lucky. My roommates 'and I dele-
gate chores, cook nutritious mcals 
on a regular basis and are overall 
generally happy, as well as abou t 
$3,000 richer. 

As for the comment tha t most 
freshmen aren 't read y for th e 
responsibility of living on their 
own, I say: What the hell are they 
doing in college? T he entire point 
of college, for a lot of people, is 
le'lrni ng to be independent. A lot of 
freshmen aren't ready for th e 
responsibility o f midterms, finals 
and bills, but that doesn't stop the 
universi ty from adminis tering 
mem.

"My specialty is giving a deep-

J ackson said. 

One of Jackson's major contri-
butions is his srudy of Chesapeake 
Bay. 

'''Without historical perspec-

he was recognized for his work in

Assistant professor of psychol-

her graduate teaching award for, . 
according to her students, her 
"contagious enthusiasm." 

"Education is teaching them 
how to learn," Dobkins said. "A 
trick is to see the faces out there

Associate biology professor

life. 
"Students are in the business 

of delivering answers and they are 
extremely good at it, but science 
is about questions," Hampton 
said. "There are a [at of things we 
don't know. That is why biology is 
so vital, because we don't know 
everything. " 

Hampton's technique for 
teaching is to make [earning 
interesting for students. 

"You have to make it global, 
make it relevant," Hampton said. 

Professor of pediatrics Vivian 
M . Reznik received the award for 
her community service. Reznik 
has created partnerships between 
the campus and the San Diego 
community through initiatives, 
including sehoo[ violence preven-
tion, K-12 reform, health and 
nutrition programs in elementary 
schools, and science and art pro-
grams for youth . 

As a pediatrician, Reznik 
attributes her desire to focus on 
youth enrichment programs to 
seei ng problems arise in her 
patients' lives as they reached ado-
lescence. 

" 'I'Ve began to look at the com-
muni ty in which these children 
were living," Reznik said . "The 
community drove us. I would like 
to see us spend more money pre-
venting problems ra ther than 
locking kids up." 

Burnham cOllcl uded the 
evening by voicing hi hopes for 
UCSD. 

"Perhaps more things will be 
learned or discovered in the next

Hunger: 
San Diego couple donates 
$5,000 to fraternity's cause 
Continued from page 1 
and charity." 

A highlight of the evening was 
when San Diego Jewish Heritage 
editor Don Harrison presen ted 
me fraternity 'with a check for 
$5,000 on behalf of an elderly 
Jewish couple who are Ho[ocaust 
survivors. 

According to Harrison, the 
couple wanted to make sure that 
no one feels the pains of hunger as 
they had . 

The donated money will be 
combined with the funds raised by 
the fraternity and donated in full 
to Mazon. 

In her address, Alpert compli-
mented the fraternity's efforts and 
stressed the lack of contributions 
to local food banks since the Sept. 
11 attacks . 

The focal point of the fund-
raising activities was the 56-hour 
bike-a-thon for hunger relief. 

The fraternity had a booth on 
Library Walk with a stationary 
bicycle. Members of the fra te rnity 
switched off riding the bike at all 
times for the three-day event. 

The event started at a. m. 
Wednesday and finished at 5 p.m. 
Fripay. 

About 130 people rode the bike 
over three days . Most of the fra-
ternity members put one hour in, 
and a couple rode for two. 

They sold raffle tickers for 
prizes donated by the community. 
They also sold donated pizza , 
doughnuts and soda. 

The goal of the ' bike-a-thon 
~vas to promote campus awareness 

MONDAY, FEBRUARY II, 2002 

of hunger problems across the 
world. 

By being visible and active on 
campus, the fraternity hoped to 
make people stop and think about 
hunger and what they could do to 
help. 

Meyers said the biggest chal -
lenge the bike-a-thon faced was 
trying to turn people's reactions 
from skepticism to awan:ness. 

"People walk by and don't take 
us seriously, thinking it's pointless 
and random," Meyers said. 

"We really want people to just 
stop and think about why we are 
here because there are an infinite 
number of causes, but hunger is a 
universal problem," he said 

The fraternity also wanted to 
create a positive image for Greek 
organizations on campus. 

"We are a fraterni ty, and most 
people don't think fraternities do 
anything good," Meyers sa id . " But 
we are trying to change that 
ste reotype. " 

Th e fraternity 'li sa got support 
from several sororities that came 
Ollt at night, raking shi fts on the 
bike and bringing cookies. 

There were at least three peo-
ple awake at all times. Meyer aid 
that at night, "the only ound was 
the sound f the bike, which was 
kind of surreal. " 

This is the third yea r the fra-
terniry has held the biking 
marathon on campus. lr srarred a 
few years ago when David Altman 
rode his bike across the country to 
raise awareness of hunger in the 
world . 

That year, the fraternity orga-
nized the first campus event to 
coincide with his arrival in San 
Diego, and it has been held every 
year since.

I t's 6:45 on Friday nighr, and in the Price Center Thearer, a guy in a cheerleader's uniform is adjusting his 
brassiere. 

He looks downstage at one of his similarly attired friends and 
asks g ravely, "Arc my boobs bigger than yours, Tpdd?" 

A girl in bo:.'Y' mannish clothes leers, "Yeah, I want to go Ollt 
with 70dd - he has bettt:J tits." She laughs, and adds, "Sorry, I'm 
being a hctcrosexualmale. " 

Divas in Denial, the UCSD Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual , 
Transgender Association's seventh-annual drag show, would-
n't start until 8 p.m., but the gender-bending was already 
well under way. 

Drag, cross-dressing, transvestism - under any 
name, the practice of wearing the clothes of the oppo-
site sex and often attempting to "pass" as a gender not 
your own - is nothing new; remember that only 
men were allowed to perform on stage in ancient 

Greek theater and in Shakespearian England.

Marshall's graduation policy fosters unrest 
Students from households without two parents face challenges 
By ALISON M. NORRIS 
Editor in Chief 

Thurgood Marshal l Co llege, 
high on its horse of self-pro-
claimed multi cultural se nsiti vity 
and diversity appre cia ti on, is 
guilty of fraud aga inst its stu-
dents. 

According to its Web ite, 
,\1 arsha ll coll ege aims to challenge 
students to "develop an informed 
sensitivity to the many cultural 
perspectives that have shaped 
mudern American socicty." The 
collt:gc also claims ro help studenr.~ 
crit ically exa minc the state of life 
\I'ithin "our divcrse Amcrican soci-
elY." 

. Politicall\', I feci that both arc 
extremely i;nportant and worth)' 
!!(Jals - bur Marshall collc!!c has 
~arelc~sl)' trampled over e;ch of 
the111 with it, dll'i"ve, insen$itivc 
and naive plans for the June com-
menccment cercmon\'. 

Marshall college allows Its 
gradua tes to invite twO individual, 
(rcad: tlVO parents) to cross the 
stage with them as they receive 
their diplomas. This concept 
seems, at first , to be a thoughtful 
gesture through which '1 student 
ma y "thank" twO people (read : 
twO parents) for the support , 
encouragement and fin ancial con-
tributions they lent to his under-

gr~ldu ate education . However, 
Marshall college's ce remonial 
"thank you" blatantly ignores the 
diversity that is tOday associated 
with family life in America . 

Imagine all the Marshall stu-
dents who come from divorced or 
never-married fami lies, whercin 
the parents no longer speak peace-
fu ll y (remember, 50 perccnt of all 
marriages end in divorce these 
days and many co uplcs nevcr 
marry). I imagine these students 
will now approach graduation day 
with anxiety and added stress , 
since 1a rsh~1I administrators h:1I'1: 
created a series of awkward situa-
tions for them: They mu,t choose 
to bring ncither parent in order to 
'lI'oid a te nse situation, effectivel" 
disappointing both parcnts, o'r 
the)' 111 list furce their parent,' 
interaction and dema nd that it be 
peaceful. 

I' or these students, choosi ng to 
bring neither parent across thc 
stage in hopes of avoidi ng a diffi-
cu lt situation opcns a ho. t of other 
conflicts - will parents be insult-
ed as they watch other student, 
being ha ppily accompanied to the 
stage, realizing that their child 
deliberately chose not to be 
escorted' 

Students f-rolll hostil e, "broken" 
or nontradit ional fami lies are 
unlikely ro be pleased that 

Marshall coll ege is forcing thcm 
iI1lo such clumsy situations on a 
day that is intended to be one of 
joy, celebration and reflection. In 
fact, I al ready know one studcnt 
who is so anxious about the 
prospect o f his unpeaceful parents 
bei ng ncar each other during grad-

All the Marshall 
students who come 

from divorced or never· 
married families, 

wherein the parents no

must force their 
parents' interaction and 

demand that it be

uation that he has opted to take his 
sis ter across the stage with hi m 
instead. He knows his parents will 
be disappointed, but tlle cost of an 
uncomfortable environment as he 
crosses tll e stage is far outweighed 

by the risk of offending them wi th 
this dccision. 

Therc 's anutller segment of the 
student population seemingl ), dis-
regardcd by the escort policy -
those who have lost OIlC or both 
parents. These students will 
already be sadly reminded or that 
absence on such a specia l day, and 
forcing cveryone elsc's parents 
onto the stage for the audicnce to 
rccogni ze and celebratr is simply a 
method of rubbing salt into 
wounos.

Kaufman interrupted, "Oh, [hi, 
is not what a girl feels like ..... and 
they continued, overlapping: 

"[ shaved my legs last night, amI 
it was hell'" 

"". Well, what it feels like for a 
girl to ge t ready and go out so me-
where, and be considered a woman 

" 

"Ri ght. Not like, givi ng birth

" .. . Not that you'd be consid-
ered a woman." 

" .. . [Bur] all dle crap that sociery 
makes you go through and snIff." 

"Yeah." 
Kaufman returned to the task-at 

ha nd, saying, "Open. You don't 
have much eyelids." 

Outside, LaPerruque looked for 
the girl who was supposed to finish 
his makeup; she was missing. 

"J've never even worn a dress 
before," he confessed, visibly ner-
vous. "It's really weird. Never done 
the makeup and all that before. It's 
a lot of work'. " 

So was obtaining the costumes, 
according to most of the m:lle per-
fo rmers. Procuring appropri ate 
clothing meant borrowing from 
friends, fi nding a lVay to try on 
items in stores with women-only 
dressing rooms, and occasionally 
s~wing from cratch. 

The finished product, Latham 
said, can be eerie. 

"When I first put on the wig and 
the makeup a couple weeks ago 
when we were rehearsing, [ looked 
in the mirror and I thought I looked 
like my older sister and it scared thc 
hell Ollt of me," he sa id, luughing.

When performers had been 

hurried behi nd the cu rtain and 
rehearsals had been finished or 
nixed due to lack of time, the fl ood-
ga tes fina lly opened and the audi-
ence, many of which had been wait-
ing outside the duors already, 
entered the theater. i\ nearly full 
house roared for tile MCs, who 
were member of the San Diego 
Kings Club, a semi-professional 
group of drag kings. 

The performers - UCS D 5nl-
dents; the so-called "Asian drag 
diva" Bl ack China; and Kings club 
performers Tommy Salami, Drake 
Bottoms, Pan T Slickers, Al 
Pachuco and Johnny O. - chal-
lenged gender ideas agai nst a back-
ground of pop music and careful 
choreography. The audience, for its 
part, seemed to love it, applauding 
and cheeri ng at every lIml. 

As the audience filed Out aftcr IllC 
show, me performers also filtered 
into the lobby to confer with friends 
and each other about the show. 

LaPern'que said he had "a 
blast," and hopes to participate 
again next year in a bigger rolc . 

But others worried about their 
onstage mistakes. 

"l fucked up so many times'" 
LGBTA principal member \Ves 
Fujimoto said. 

Elean r Roosevelt College fresh-
man and "Divas in Den.ial" mher 
Kara Desert consoled him: "But you

UCSD drops to 4-8 
Tritons now 11 th in CCAA 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team continued its recent stnrggles, 
dropping games to California State 
Un.iversity teams from Stanislaus 
and Bakersfield tlus weekend . 

The Tri tons started the 
Central Valley swing with a disap· 
pointing 67 -63 loss to the 
Warriors of Cal State Stanislaus 
Friday night. 

Going into the half leadi ng 
35-25, UCSD seemed poised to 
grab its fifth California Collegiate 
Athletic Association win, but the 
Tritons ' lack of depth and lack of 
inside presence was too much to 
overcome. 

Reserve Casey Harrington, 
who was averaging three minutes 
a game, came off the bench in the 
second stanza, leading Stanislaus 
to a 14-point turnaround and the 
t\ 7 -63 victory. 

Reasons for the second· hal f 
collapse abound . Besides insert· 
ing llarring ton, th e Warri ors 
shot a sizzling 45.2 percent from 
the fi eld (14-3 1) in the second 
half while the Tritons fi'oze inside 
and out, shooting 32.4 percent 
(1 1-H), f':lr bel ow thei r cason 
average of 41 .5 percent. 

The Tri tons fell short on 
rt.!hounds ·B -37. While the starting 
UCSD fron tlinc of J odv 1" oods, 
Ryan Swed and .!orda l; Watkins 
added 25 rehounds in total, tile 
11'lIon g"uards and rcserves b rled to 
pull down their share of rehoumb. 

T he starting hackcourt for the 
\ \ 'arrinrs pu ll ed down :1 C0111 -
hined 13 rebound" b ut rheir 
Triton counterparts only pull ed 

down four, providing the key ele· 
ment in the rebound column. 

Freshman center Watkins led 
tlle Tritons in scoring with 14 
points while Woods chipped in 13. 
Woods and Swed both led the 
team in rebowlds with nine apiece. 

Saturday night, the Tritons fell 
to the Roadrunners of Cal State 
Bakersfield , 89-82, in a difficult 
match agai nst the nation's No. 23 
team. 

T he Tritons again relied on 
outside shooting to keep the 
game close but could not contain 
the Roadrunners' guard pl ay. 

It would be an understatement 
to say the Tritons live and die by 
the three: T hey decis ively lead 
the California Collegiate Atllletic 
Association in three·point fie.ld 
goal attempts. This game was the 
perfect example of why that strat· 
egy has no t produced many wins. 

UCSD missed its first eight 
three.point attempts and trailed by 
10 during the first half. The 
Tritons made II of their next 12 
threc·point attempt and ' took 
tll eir only lead early in the second 
half after Swed scored the team's 
final tluee·pointer. 

The Tri tons then missed theil' 
fin al three attempts from beyond 
the arc wlule watching Baker field 
pull aw,IY for the victory. 

Aga in , rei ounds played a pi v. 
131 ro le in thi s ga me when 

UCS D - the worst rehoun ti ine 
team in the CCAA - managed t~ 
Pli ll down only 27 bOllnls agai nst 
the Ro), drul1 ncrs' 35. 

\Voods led the Trito ns, pour-
ing in a scawil-high 19 points :l nd 
:1 tca lll . high nine rebou nds. Swed 
added I ' points and six rebounds.

felt good about the way her club 
stacked up against Davis. 

"They didn't impress me tlla t 
much. [ think wc're a better team," 
she said. 

The Tritons were given an oppor· 
tunity to prove tllcmseives when they 
took on the Wildcats of Chico State 
on Sa tuTda y. 

"Chico tate is not somebody we 
should ever lose to," Harlan said . 

('!arlan allowed only two hits in 
seven ilmings for the complete game 
shutout. Mettee walked in tlle first 
inning, was sacrificed to second, 
went to third on a groundout and 
scored on a wild pitch for the game's 
only run. 

In the second game, pitcher 
Martinelli sparkled, strilcing out 14 
Wildcats in the 2- t victory. 
Martinelli also picked up an RBf in 
the sixth inning against Wildcat 
pitcher Katie Stokx. 

After five·and·a·half scoreless 
innings, UCS D capita lized un a 
Wildcat mistake to get its half of the 
inning started. Anderson reached 
base because Chico shortStop 
Megan Farnham could not handle a 
sharply hit grounder. Anderson 
moved to second when [tarl an laid

UCSD splits on road Water polo hosts invitational 
Tritons beat Indiana, lose to. University of Hawaii Women's basketball now 7-9 

By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

After suffering the most disap-
poinung losses of the season the 
previous weekend , the UCSD 
women', basketball team traveled 
to Central \ :,lIey this weekend, 
splitting ~all1cs with California 
St.lte niversities Stanislaus and 
Ba kersficld . 

Friday night the Tritons 
Ir:J "ded to Turlock w take o n 
Ih~ Warriors of CSUS, picking 
up :t 75-63 \'iewry. 

The Tri tons used hot three-
poillt shooting (6 for 8) in the 
first half to build a 36-25 lead . 

UCSD !;ooled off in the sec-
ond half but managed to add 
.Inuther poi nt to the margin of 
vIctory. 

In ' a balanced attack. Ali 
Ginn led the tealll In scofl ng 
with 1<) points. Nl3ya Fok added 
14, while i\largaret Johnson and 
, icholle Bromley added 12. 
Bromley led the team In 
rebounds, picking up eight. 

Center Shannon Donnley 
added 25 points and eight 
rebounds for the Warriors, but 
her inside dominance was not 
enough to keep the home side 
close. 

The l 'j' itons traveled south 
to take o n the Ng. 2 1 
RO:l<lrunners of CSU13 Saturday 
night. Unfortunately, UCS D 
COline: up on the losing end and 
was never close to knocking off 
the California Collegi:tte 
Athleti c Association's econd-
plJce tealll. 

Up 9-8 in the first half, the 
Tritons fell victim to a 15 -0 run 
that saw the lead jump to 14. 

UCSD never came within 12 
points for the rest of the game. 

During that fLlIl, 
Bakersfield's Diane Dittbprner 
shot her 76th three-point field 
goa I of the season, tyi ng the 
CCM record . Dittburner 
added two more before the 
game ended to give her the 
record, with six games left to 
play. 

UCSD did manage to contain 
dle nation's leading scorer, center 
Heather Garay, to 16 points, but 
Dittburner 's 23 were too much 
for the Tritons to handle. 

ByANUKUMAR 
Staff Writer 

After winning over Hartwick 
College to kick off the season, the 
UCSD women's water polo team 
hosted the UCSD NoGrip 
Invitational this past weekend. 

The Tritons' division included 
University of Hawaii and Indiana. 
On Saturday, each team played two 
games, one against each of the other 
two teams in the same division. 

In their first game, the Tritons fell 
to the Rainbows, 8-4. The TritOns 
managed to keep the game close 
throughout the first half. At halftime, 
Hawaii led by only one goal, 4-3. The TritOns were hindered 

by poor team shooting going 
20-63 (3 1.7 percent) from the 
field. well below their season 
average of 36.7 percent. 

However, UCSD struggled in 
the linal two quarters. The 
Rainbows played a more aggressive 
style of defense and allowed just one 
goal in the second half. On the other 
end of the pool , the TritOns could 
not contain the Rainbows, who were 
able to earn and capitalize on open 
looks at the goal. 

Sam ScoufosiGuardian 

South-paw: UCSD's Danielle Boyle <#2) looks to pass against a defender. 

Ginn led the TritOns in scor-
ing with 13 and in rebounds with 
six. Sand hal Nelson. in her mo t 
minutes of play this season, 
added six boards and five points. 

This road tri p came on the 
heels o f last week's heartbreak-
ing losses to San Francisco State 
University and Sonoma State 
University. Entering those 
matches, the Tritons were 
ranked o. lOin the west widl 
an outside chance of making the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association tOurnament. Their 
losses to San Francisco, Sonoma 
and Bakersfield all but ended 
any chance the Tritons had to 
compete in post-season play. 
UCSD is now 7-9 in the CCAA 
and 11 - 10 overall. 

The Tritons return to action 
Friday nighr against California 
State University Dominguez 
Hill s. The annual UCSD Spirit 
Night game tips off at 5:3 0 p.m. 

Junior Dana Tucker led the 
Tritons, scoring two goals in the 
game. Team captain Emma 
Kudritzki and freshman Lindsay 
Grossman had one goal each. 

Playing against Indiana in its sec-
ond game, UCSD jwnped out into 

Softball: 
Tritons go 3-1 over 
weekend 
Continued from page 20 
moved the nmners to second and 
third with one out. Harlan reached 
on a fielder's choice, scoring Cope 
with. the tying run and moving 
Mettee to third. Aggabao then 

an early lead and never let the game 
get close in its' 9-5 victory over 
Indiana. 

In the first half, UCSD scored 
two goals in the opening quarter, 
and added four more in the second. 
Indiana could not establish its 
offense and only managed to score 
once in the entire first half, which 
ended with the Tritons leading 6-1. 

UCSD maintained its advantage 
in the second half of the game. 
Indiana never made a threatening 

picked up her first hit of the day, 
bringing in Mettee and winning the 
opener for the Tritons. 

"We didn't play our best but we 
played as a team," head coach Patti 
Gerckens said afterward. "When we 
playas a team, we will win games." 

The team effort was less success-
ful in the second game because the 
TritOns lacked big hits and played 
somewhat suspect defense en route 
to a 3-1 loss.

Kudritzki had four goals in the 
Tritons' second game of the tourna-
ment. giving her a total of five on the 
day. Tucker and junior Elizabeth 
Keesey contributed two goals each, 
while junior Daniel Boyle scored 
once. 

After the first day of il1l~tational, 
the Tritons were 2- 1 in the early sea-

White hit her second home run of 
the afternoon, this one a two-nUl shoe 
that was enough to provide a lead the 
Aggies would not relinquish. 

The lone Triton run came in the 
sixth when .I-Iarlan and Martinelli 
each doubled. Davis pitcher Amy 
Rosson was so-ong, allowing only six 
hits over seven innings for the win.

Tennis: 
Men start season off strong with 2-0 
record, next play Alliant International 
Continued from p,!ge 20 

Haydcn-Wilson pl:lycd an impressive match, easily 
takinE! dle first set 6-1 . However, Desert's Danicl Briseno 
rallied to take the second set 6-3, and the twO played to 
a tie-breaker that Wilson-Hayden won 7-6 (6). 

On Saturday, the Tritons lInished off' a demanding 
week with a 6-3 victory over visiting Cal Poly Pomona. 
This time, the "ll'iton won twO of three doubles 
matches when the Brian SwattlSameer Chopra and 
Michael Meyer/Everett Schroeter teams tallied win. 
They were followed with a repeat of the previous day 
- singles wins by Meyer, ""ilson, Wilson-Hayden 
and Novak. 

"II tl was a good win over a good team," head coach 
Eric Steidlmaycr said on the team's Web site. "We 
knew it was going to be tough and it certainly was. [ 
think this match also highlighted a few things we ca n 
improve all .. . Our doubles play 1I1USt get better, and 
our readines to begin the matche must impreve if we 
arc to be a very good team." 

T he SW:lttlChopnl team pbyed the nail-biter of the 
day, since they were down fOllr match points against Cal 
Polys Ryan Terty and Andy Roland before rallying to 
force a tie-breaker and ,vin the match 9-8 (2). 

"It was tOward the end when we were down," Swatt 
sa id . "1 have a tendency to be more up-and-down in 
my emotions, but Sameer isn't. I looked to him. Both 
tllO"e guys were really good players " . I t worked out 
for us, but Sameer really came through for us today." 

Meyer had a long weekend, with both of his 
matches going to three sets. On Friday against 
Desert. he played Rye Kashawabara to a 6-~, 4-6, 6-
1 victory. On Saturday, he played another grueling 
match that wcnt the distance. This time, Cal Poly 
Pomona 's Rya n Terry fell , ~-6 , 7-6 (3). 6-1, in anoth-
er lengthy battle - a common occurrence for the 
li'itolls this season. 

"We've \Von a lot of three-set matches," Swatt sa id. 
"[For examplel, Mike \Vas in better shape against a 
really good guy and came out on top. Our condition-
ing helps us win a lot of third-set matches, and I think 
tlmt will payoff in the later matches of the season." 

The teams conditioning is not rl1..:ir most important 
asset, however, because Swact said its the Ttitons' com-
petitive nalllre is what has drivcn them so far tllis season. 

"That we have a competitive attitude is our biggest 
thing," Swatt said. "Nobody wants to lose; everybody's

fighting. Physically, we have a lot of talent, but it takes 
dlat unwillingness to lose - that fighting attitude has 
helped us in ollr matches so far." 

Last season, tile lritons lost to thc Roadrunners 6-3, 
and follo\ving two rainouts, the Tritons fell to Cal Poly 
Pomona 5-4 in their meeting last season. The Tritons 
also defeated Azusa Pacific University 6-3 earlier in dle 
week after losing to dlem by the same score last season. 

"We lost to all of those teams last year. so to come 
back, we feci the team is a lot deeper and we're 
improved," Swatt said. "We proved this week d,at 
we're a much better team than we were last year ... \Ve 
still have a ways to improve, but we're llefinitcly on the 
right track. " 

The week had its share of ' ucccss stories, but the 
team had a care last weekend at the Cal Poly 
Individual ' Iournament when Swatt suffered from heat 
exhaustion during his draining third-round, tllrce-set 
victory over College of the Desert's Kunia M inata. 

Swart said he started cramping during the second 
set but played through it, and as a result, (he cramping 
worsened after the match. He went to a hospital, 
where several precautionary tests were conducted 
before his release.

Volleyball 
drops two 
to Warriors 
Undefeated 
Hawaii too 
strong at home 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The men's vollel'ball team had 
the tough assignment of traveling 
to Honolulu last weekend for a 
two-gamc serics agai nst the 

\Varrior~ of the . University of 
Hawaii. 

Playing in front of :l hostilc 
crowd of 4,759, the li'i tons fell to 
the third -ranked \Narriors in 
trai(!ht se ts, 30-23, 30-20 and 0-

1 R. It was a tough match for UCS D 
because Hawaii 's Kimo Tuyny had 
22 assists and Jose Delgado led all 
players with II ki lls. 

[n the fir t set, hitting percent-
age told the story, since the Tritons 
hit .024 while University of l lawaii 
finis hed the game with 'a .2R6 per-
centage and a 1-0 lead on the 
Tritons. 

T he next set wa. similar, with 
UCS D managi ng only 10 kills rel -
ative to 15 errors, fini hing with a 
-. 114 attack percentage in the sec-
ond set. UCSD head coach Ron 
Larsen earned a yellow c.lnl during 
the game while the Tritons slipped 
behind the Warriors 0-2 . 

UCSD saved the be t set for 
last, smacking 16 kills and tlnishing 
with a .394 percentage in the third 
set. However, the Warriors were 
too much, hi tti ng an astounding 
.704 to close out the match . 

The Tritons were led by Jim 
Waller, who fini shed with nine 
kills, and Jordan Hove, who con-
tributed 33 assists to the UCSD 
effort. 

The next day was more of the 
same for the Tritons when they 
dropped their second -s trai ght 
ga me to the Warriors. 

T he Warriors began the game 
by ga rnering 16 kill s in the first er, 
whil e CS D was only able to pick 
up six. T he Tritons committed 
nine errors en route to the 1.--30 
loss. 

[n the econd set, the Tritons 
bounced back for their best se t of 
the trip, playing tough before 
fa lling 26-30. T he UCS D defense 
held H awai i to 12 kills and lowest 
hitting percentage of the game , 
ye t was unable to take advantage 
due to the vVarrior defense, which 
held the Tritons to a .206 per-
centage. 

The la t gam e of tl,e set was 
agai n close for UCSD, but in the 
end it was tagged with the 24-30 
loss. 

The Trirons were led by Eric 
Perrine, who ended with a m atc h-
high 16 kills . The Warriors tln-
ished with three players in dou-
ble- digits for kills, led by 
Delgado's 13 . 

With the two losses, the 
Warriors improve to 9-2 overall 
and remain perfect in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation with a 6-0 record. The 

, Tritons drop to 1-9 overall and at 
0-8 are still seeking their first 
MPSF victory of the season .
