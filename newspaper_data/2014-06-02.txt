The Civic Leadership Fund’s 
new UCSD chapter, a division of the 
national nonprofit organization, hosted 
its first leadership panel on Tuesday, 
May 27, in Price Center Theater. The 
panel included five total incoming and 
outgoing members of A.S. Council 
who hope to foster civic engagement 
and interdisciplinary discussions.

The cofounders of CLF UCSD 
invited former Associate Vice-
President of Enterprise Operations 
Irene Chang, Associate Vice-President 
of Environmental and Social Justice 
Sierra Donaldson, Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Igor Geyn, 
former Sixth College Senator Allison 
Bagnol and former Campuswide 
Senator Jehoan Espinoza to speak at 
the panel. The organization’s Executive 
Director Anuj Kommareddy asked the 
panel questions that focused on A.S. 
Council’s finances and communication.

Kommareddy began by pointing 
out the various budget difficulties 
that the previous and current Council 
encountered — including the large 
mandate reserve withdrawal to fund 
cultural, graduation-related events 
— and asked what reevaluations or 
changes were made to prevent any 
future crises in the coming year.

Geyn explained that the Council 
would pay particular attention to 
student organization funding, which 
currently receives one of the largest 
allocations from the A.S. budget. 

“We’re looking at the existing 
policies and looking at ways we can 
be more transparent,” Geyn said. 
“Obviously only some of us are in A.S. 
Council, but almost all of us here at 
UCSD are in some kind of student org, 
so we want to make sure that students 
have the ability to put on events and 
programs, as well as looking at ways 
to boost our enterprises and services.”

Donaldson added how pivotal 
it was for A.S. Council to have 
recognized that overspending was a 
real issue, thus leading to discussions 
about possible long-term solutions. 
Geyn acknowledged the difficulty in 
prioritizing certain programs over 
others, but said that gaining input from 
students was an important first step. 
He further noted that college councils 
were a great, alternative source of 
student organization funding.

Kommareddy later asked about 
the panel’s view on past A.S. Council 
relations with college councils, as well 
as ways to better facilitate cooperation 
between them. 

Espinoza said that communication 
was not always adequate, especially 
due to tensions arising from last year’s 
budget constraints. He suggested that 
A.S. Council and college councils 
collaborate on campuswide projects

UC Reaches Agreement 
with Postdoctoral Union

The University of California and the postdoctoral union, United Auto Workers Local 5810 reached a settlement on May 
28 after two years of negotiations regarding the 
University’s alleged overcharging or altogether 
exclusion of post doctorates’ (or postdocs) health 
benefits guaranteed in their union contract.

The settlement included $140,000 in 
retroactive compensation to those affected by the 
mismanagement and preventative stipulations. It 
also guaranteed that union members will be 
given up-to-the-minute information about their 
plans. The settlement accounts for union alumni 
as well.

“We’ve been discussing settlements for over 
a year,” Local 5810 President Neal Sweeney, 
representative of  over 6,000 union workers, said. 
“Working together, we presented a strong argument 
to the University and were able to demand fairness.”

According to Sweeney, some of the people being 
paid back are no longer in their postdoc positions. 
He said that there are effectively 121 people sharing 
the $140,000.

Normally, UC health benefits for postdocs 
are contracted at $10 to $50 per month for 
health coverage. After the union filed grievances 
against the management last year, it was made 
apparent that the contract was broken by the 
Uuniversity. One of the grievances, according to 
Sweeney, detailed the UC system telling a group 
of postdocs they had to pay the UC’s share of 
the health plan, at times up to $1,300 a month. 
The union — made up predominantly of recent 
immigrants with work visas and employed at 
the university labs, earning an average salary of 
$46,000 in 2012 — began a petition in February 
2013 to provide equal access and fair payment 
plans to all of its members.

The Office of the Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management and 
Planning proposed to implement the 
UC Regent’s Policy on Non-Affiliate 
Access at UCSD, which would limit 
the rights and access of non-university 
affiliates while on campus. 

The policy defines non-affiliates 
as “any person who is not any of the 
following: a student, officer, official 
volunteer, employee, regent or emeri-
tus of the University of California or a 
member of a household authorized to 
reside in university property.”

The policy includes a curfew 
for non-affiliates from 12 a.m. to 
6 a.m. but this rule does not apply 

to “university-housing residents or 
their invited guests, invited guests of 
university faculty, emeritus or staff, 
persons possessing valid, written 

authorization from the designated 
university official or those on legiti-

Proposed Rules Would Set New Curfew
Non-affiliates would be barred between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. under new guidelines.

According to two new studies 
conducted by the American 
Urological Association, physical 
activity may be associated with a 
decreased risk in bladder cancer 
mortality and how women may be 
subject to worse outcomes from 
bladder cancer. These findings were 
presented at the annual meeting 
of the American Urological 
Association, held in Orlando, 
Florida from May 16 to 21.

The National Health Information 
Survey, with the aid of UCSD’s 
clinical instructor for the Society of 
Urological Oncology Fellow Michael 
Liss, conducted the experiment by 
gathering information from 1998 

to 2004 on 222,163 individuals. 
Participants were asked questions 
about their health, such as whether 
they “did no exercise” versus “light, 
moderate or vigorous exercises.”

Individuals who reported “any 
physical activity” were 53 percent 
less likely to die of general bladder 
cancer than those who do not 
exercise. Former smokers were three 
times as likely to die of bladder 
cancer, and current smokers were 
over four times as likely as well.

The researchers identified 83 
bladder cancer-specific deaths and 
found that bladder cancer mortality 
was not associated with being 
overweight or obesity compared 
with normal weight.

From the Vanderbilt University 
in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Jeffrey 
Bassett and other colleagues 

aided in the examination of 9,220 
Medicare A and B beneficiaries to 
determine the relationship between 
gender, race and the completeness 
of hematuria evaluation.

These studies found that women 
are less likely to undergo a hematuria 
evaluation, which may lead to worse 
outcomes for women who would 
be later diagnosed with cancerous 
tumors in the bladder. Hematuria is 
the presence of blood in the urine and 
is the most common sign of bladder 
cancer. A hematuria evaluation 
entails a full physical examination of 
the patient that includes laboratory 
and imaging studies.

Conducted in a multivariable 
analysis, the results reported that 
females are less likely than males to 
be seen by an urologist and undergo 
diagnostic procedures or imaging. 

Females were also less likely to have 
an in-depth assessment in the form 
of a workup. A complete workup of 
a patient’s blood by a physician can 
identify if certain red blood cells 
exist within the urine. 

Inadequate hematuria evaluations 
might be a contributing factor to a 
worse outcome for females diagnosed 
with bladder cancer. 

“Our data demonstrates that 
female Medicare beneficiaries are 
less likely to undergo a hematuria 
evaluation,” Bassett and other 
colleagues said in the evaluation of 
the data. “[Females] may therefore 
be less likely to receive a definitive 
urologic diagnosis, even when one 
is present.”

Fewer Bladder Problems for the Active, AUA Study Says

BY  m eryl  press

▶ Coalition of Scholars Calls for 
Worldwide Endorsement of Data 
Citation Principles

A global coalition of professors, 
researchers and other scholars, 
including UCSD affiliates, endorsed 
the proposed “The Joint Declaration 
of Data Citation Principles.” The Data 
Citation Synthesis Group, which 
wrote the proposal, aims to create 
an overarching guideline for citing 
digital data for scholarly research. 

The Data Citation Synthesis 
Group is comprised of 40 
individuals representing more than 
25 organizations worldwide. UCSD 
neuroscience professor Maryann 
Martone is the group’s Executive 
Director and principal investigator.

“Scholars don’t just produce 
written text, they produce software 
code, workflows, data and 
databases,” Martone said. “These 
things are all scholarship themselves 
but there’s not currently a consistent 
way of citing them in academic 
literature.”

Force 11, a UCSD division of the 
Qualcomm Institute — a California 
Institute for telecommunications 
and Information Technology — was 
one of the groups that endorsed the 
proposal.

▶ Chancellor Expands Educational 
Opportunities Available to 
Students in Imperial Valley

UCSD Chancellor Pradeep 
K. Khosla announced the addition 

of Imperial Valley College to the 
Chancellor’s Associates Scholars 
program at a reception held on May 
24. 

The Chancellor’s Associates 
Scholars program aims to provide 
scholarships to members of historically 
underserved and disadvantaged 
communities by giving them access to 
college educations. Each recipient will 
receive $10,000 annually to cover fees 
for supplies and transportation, as well 
as living expenses.

Scholarship recipients were 
required to be eligible under 
the University’s Blue and Gold 
Opportunity Plan. The Blue and 
Gold Opportunity Plan also helps 
undergraduate students by covering 
costs for tuition and fees for families 
that make an annual income of less 
than $80,000. 

According to a UCSD News 
Center article, the program began 
in Fall 2013 and was only open to 
students from Gompers Preparatory 
Academy, Lincoln High School and 
The Preuss School. UCSD provided 
an annual $10,000 scholarship for 
four years to 45 individuals. High 
school graduates were also required 
to have eligibility under the Blue 
and Gold Opportunity Plan as well 
as an acceptance to UCSD.

The program will be open to 
transfer students from San Diego 
City College, Southwestern College 
and Imperial Valley College starting 
Fall 2014.

“The University has been doing 
this practice where they’re treating 
different people differently based on 
what kind of funding source you have,” 
Sweeney said. 

Sweeney also said that the recent 
settlement has shown the union’s 
perseverance has guaranteed “equal 
benefits for everyone at affordable rates 
and they won’t be treated differently 
based on what kind of funding they 
have for their research.”

At press time, the UC Office of the 
President had not issued a statement 
regarding the settlement or the 
allegations against the University.

mate, university-related business or 
attending a specific university-spon-
sored event.” It also does not apply to 
“people proceeding directly across a 
roadway or path that has been des-
ignated by the designated university 
official as open to the public during 
curfew hours.”

Other mandates of the policy 
include guidelines on non-affiliate 
usage of alcohol, fire, nudity, gath-
erings and demonstrations, on-
campus camping, storage of per-
sonal belongings and solicitation. 
The policy also includes stipulations 
against non-affiliates bringing ani-
mals to campus; it states that unau-
thorized animals must “remain on a 

leash or under the hand control of a 
responsible person at all times.”

Those wishing to comment on 
the proposal may submit written 
responses to Director of Policy 
and Records Administration Paula 
Johnson before June 30.

to restore relations and interactions. 
Chang said she thought that the high 
turnover rate of all councilmembers 
made it difficult to transfer knowledge 
and perspectives, which hampered 
relations between councils. Bagnol 
added that the associate vice-president 
of college affairs would need to step 
up and make sure all seven governing 
bodies were on the same page.

As for relations with administrators, 
most of the panel agreed that they had 
multiple avenues of contact due to 
their student government positions, 
including sitting on campuswide 
committees. Unlike the other members, 
however, Chang held more negative 
views on her committee interactions.

“Certainly, there are committees 
and commissions for everything you 
can possibly think of, but it’s hard 
to follow up and follow through,” 
she said. “At the end of the day, the 
administration has its own choice 

in terms of what it wants … Some 
of them are really helpful and really 
beneficial, but they can put their foot 
down in some aspects.”

Continuing with views on student 
body relations, Donaldson said that 
although Council has been reaching out 
to a more diverse constituency, there 
is still a large portion of the student 
population that is not actively involved 
or aware of its operations. Geyn and 
Bagnol added how fundamental it 
is for A.S. representatives to remain 
involved and informative with 
students, especially with transportation 
and other relevant issues.

Kommareddy closed the discussion 
by asking the panel’s experience 
working alongside organizations 
outside UCSD. The speakers 
unanimously said it is important to 
expand outside of the UCSD “bubble” 
and to become civically involved with 
specific San Diego community issues. 

After the event, Kommareddy 
and his fellow CLF UCSD cofounders 

told the UCSD Guardian that the 
Leadership Panel was a success. They 
thought it was effective to focus on a 
large governing body like ASUCSD, 
including its flaws and possible 
solutions, to promote greater student 
involvement. CLF UCSD hopes to 
hold regular, publicized panels with 
other student speakers in the future, 
including an annual discussion 
between outgoing and incoming A.S. 
Council officials. 

Publicized panels are only one of 
several long-term projects, the largest 
of which will be a Youth Leadership 
Conference held in October that plans 
to hold seminars presented by various 
guest organizations, like Launch 
Progress. The CLF UCSD’s hope is that 
this will give young people a yearly 
“avenue to form new relationships and 
come up with exciting new ideas” to 
directly affect the San Diego area.

Incumbent Toni Atkins represents a number of firsts for the California legislature. She’s the first 
Speaker of the House to represent San Diego (and thus, the 78th district that includes UCSD). She’s 
only the third woman to hold the job and the first openly gay woman to lead the assembly. Atkins 
has our district’s best interests at heart and now has the opportunity to employ her leadership skills 
to make great legislation for the 78th.

As speaker of the Democratic-controlled assembly, Atkins controls votes and passage of legisla-
tion — a power that has been, until now, reserved for leaders from upstate. As the face of the assem-
bly, Atkins gives a newfound attention to America’s Finest City on a statewide level. A proponent 
of veterans’ services, job creation for San Diego and, of course, education, we hope that Atkins can 
continue her work beyond November’s election.

As Edmund “Jerry” Brown runs for his unprecedented fourth term in the 
governor’s office, we don’t see any reason not to keep him in Sacramento. 
During his current term, Brown has been a champion for University of 
California education, providing the system with more money than the previ-
ous administration had. Under Brown’s watch, California’s higher education 
now receives more funding than prisons do, tuition has been stable for nearly 
four years at UC campuses and the governor’s pet, Proposition 30, prevented 
millions of cuts to the UC system that would have spiked tuition by nearly 
$2,500.

Brown’s biggest challengers are right-wing Tea Party ally Tim Donnelly and 
former bank-bailout chief Neel Kashkari. Both are running on platforms that 
appear to drain funding away from critical services for the state. Donnelly has 
radicalized views on immigration reform, and Kashkari hasn’t proven himself 
an effective leader as Brown has. With either of these Republican challengers 
at the helm, the UC system, and the state, would be worse off.

Brown’s frugality and plans for expanding California’s rainy-day fund protocol 
are the responsible policies we need for 2015 and beyond. The UCSD Guardian 
fully endorses the governor’s re-election campaign and looks forward to the posi-
tive changes Brown can bring for the UC system into his next term.

The State  
of  Veteran
Care Is a
Disgrace

Veterans Affairs Deputy Inspector General Richard Griffin released a preliminary 
report in the wake of Memorial Day 
that confirmed allegations of miscon-
duct at VA hospitals. According to the 
report, hospital staff covered up long 
wait times and cooked the books at 
the expense of their patients in order 
to excel in performance reviews. 
Employees were instructed to enter 
false patient data and were reportedly 
threatened if they didn’t alter data to 
favor their supervisors. Patients were 
booked at non-existent clinics or put 
on unofficial waiting lists to improve 
clinic availability data, putting vet-
erans with serious conditions at risk 
and reportedly causing deaths because 
patients were not seen in time. The 
dishonesty within the current VA 
system is completely disgraceful and 
does not show the proper respect for 
veterans and their sacrifices.

Griffin reports that the problem 
is systemic throughout the VA health 
care system. In Phoenix, veterans were 
forced to wait an average of 115 days 
before their first medical appoint-
ment, which is five times longer than 
what was reported by the hospital. 
Furthermore, 1,700 veterans waiting 
for medical care never appeared on 
any official waiting list and may never 
have received treatment. 

There are two reasons for the poor 
quality of service: a shortage of prima-
ry-care physicians and the high num-
ber of veterans and service members 
from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
According to VA department statis-
tics, in the last three years primary-
care appointments have soared by 
50 percent while the number of 
primary-care doctors has grown by 
only 9 percent. Each of those doc-
tors treats 60 percent more patients 
than they should be responsible for, 
said J. David Cox Sr., president of the 
American Federation of Government 
Employees. This is because the 
department is spending too much 
money hiring administrators and not 
enough on doctors and nurses. Cox 
also mentions a culture of fear at VA 
hospitals that prevents whistleblowers 
from reporting dishonest actions.

The current state of VA hospitals 
warrants nationwide changes, which 
are difficult to implement because 
of the lack of a standardized orga-
nization among medical centers. 
Traditionally, VA hospitals have fol-
lowed the motto: “All health care is 
local,” but this results in confusion 
over the local implementation of 
actions required by national direc-
tives, such as the tracking and trend-
ing of patient complaints. 

Moving forward, a key political 
question is whether the VA system 
should expand or move toward 
privatization to cope with physician 
shortages and crippling wait times 
compounded by several thousands 
of service members’ return from Iraq 
and Afghanistan. While some believe 
that veterans should be sent to pri-
vate physicians if they wait for more 
than 30 days for care, others want to 
increase funding, create new VA facil-
ities and draw more physicians to VA 
hospitals by offering loan forgiveness 
programs to medical students. 

Regardless of specific reform, we 
are all hoping that policymakers can 
unite around caring for our veterans 
and that these events will draw atten-
tion to the crisis of primary care 
throughout our healthcare system.

Primary Elections Endorsements

Jerry Brown, Governor
State of California

When the Guardian sat down with Peters in 
November, we were impressed to see the ambitious 
number of projects the freshman Democratic congress-
man was working on. More impressive, however, is the 
frequency with which Peters travels to the UCSD campus 
to meet with students. Peters has time and time again 
indicated that he is dedicated to improving our educa-
tion and has the track record to prove it.

While the 52nd district election will probably draw 
Peters and Republican former city councilman Carl DeMaio 
into a November runoff, Peters is the better of the two for 
the UCSD community. We rest easy knowing that UCSD 
students are represented by Scott Peters, a La Jolla resident 
and a former advisor to the UCSD Chancellor’s Community 
Advisory Board, who shows that students come first.

Gavin Newsom is a tested and true champion for California. As the incum-
bent lieutenant governor, Newsom has worked to improve healthcare, expand 
access to higher education and create jobs throughout the state. Though the 
position isn’t typically an influential one (it mainly exists to provide a clear suc-
cession plan for the departure of a sitting governor), Newsom still finds ways to 
have a meaningful impact on the state — whether as an advocate for a fiscally 
responsible UC system or as a leader for marriage equality.

The incumbent has promising re-election prospects as his experience and 
leadership potential that seem to far outpace that of his opponents. Facing a 
field of underqualified challengers, Newsom will likely take the Guardian’s sup-
port into another four years in Sacramento. Where he ends up in the years that 
follow remains to be seen. Regardless of his final political destination, Newsom 
is a fighter for a stronger California and has firm ownership of the Guardian 
endorsement.

In an age where everything will 
live forever on the internet, some 
people are asking for their private 
history back. Privacy is an indi-
vidual liberty, and it is within every 
person’s best interest to keep this 
right. If past, and often irrelevant, 
information on the internet is not 
removed, citizens can be disadvan-
taged and constantly judged for 
their outdated decisions.

Take the 2014 resignation of 
Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, who 
was pressured to step down based 
on his support for the Proposition 
8 ballot from 2008. How he voted 
six years ago should not affect 
his job. When Eich was forced 
to resign this year, it was for the 
wrong reasons. 

The decision was not based on 
an ability to lead or on his mastery 
of the field — relevant concerns 
about a CEO — but rather an unre-
lated political stance. 

Eich is not alone here. In the 
case of Costeja Gonzalez, the man 
who brought the court case against 
Google to the European Union, his 
sense of responsibility was being 
judged based on his prior debts. 
Although Gonzalez had once been 
in debt, he was able to recover 
from his experience and now lives 
debt free. Factoring old informa-
tion about Gonzalez’s financial 
capabilities mistakenly disregards 
his current abilities for the sake of 
irrelevant decisions.

Wanting to keep something 
in the past should not be seen as 
censorship. Citizens are liable to be 
wrongly judged in the present for 
irrelevant actions from the past. 
Factoring such information out of 
the equation is not only necessary 
but beneficial to the public, and the 
EU should be applauded for real-
izing this.

Access to Individuals’ 
Internet Backgrounds Is a 
Useful Safeguard

Overreaching Decision 
Could Compromise Public 
“Right to Know”

Ruling Protects Citizens’ 
Natural Rights to Privacy 
and Second Chances

While the supporters of the 
European court’s decisions praise the 
“right to be forgotten,” the case sets a 
precedent for unfounded censorship 
and irresponsible internet usage that 
should not spread to the United States.

According to the Washington Post, 
European citizens can now request the 
removal of personally relevant infor-
mation that they deem “inadequate, 
irrelevant or excessive.” However, the 
entire premise of the internet is that 
it provides unfettered, global access 
to information that others post and 
share. Search engines, like Google, 
operate with the goal of safeguarding 
the general public’s “right to know.”

Although moderate regulation 
keeps the web safe and efficient, forc-
ing Google to cater to an individual’s 
whim removes an unsettling amount 
of power from the populace. If noth-
ing else, we deserve to see important 
details about someone’s past, like 
criminal records and business associa-
tions. In addition, search engines now 
risk being bombarded with trivial 
removal requests.

Furthermore, Eric Tornoe, a com-
puter expert at the University of St. 
Thomas, points out that most online 
data is “nearly impossible to get rid 
of” and stays on the web indefinitely. 
Removing links from Google search 
results does not remedy this issue nor 
should it try to. Posting compromis-
ing information is both reckless and 
foolhardy, and people ultimately must 
remain accountable for their actions 
both offline and online. 

Compelling Google to remove 
legitimate information from the 
public domain has worrisome impli-
cations that could limit freedom of 
expression in the future. The court 
decision might have been made with 
good intentions, but it unfairly tasks 
search engines with cleaning up after 
our own digital mistakes.

The use of social media has 
increasingly become a means of 
record keeping, essentially leaving 
an indelible imprint of one’s own 
actions. Society has become infatu-
ated with the convenience and fun of 
communicating via Facebook or sat-
isfying one’s deepest, darkest conun-
drums via Google. However, many 
don’t realize the permanence of the 
posts that they share. Although it 
may compromise privacy, having 
access to one’s history of misconduct 
or crime could provide useful pre-
cautions for society. 

As with several other search 
engines, Google is permitted to 
collect information about its users 
upon their consent; individuals can 
also be searched on Google with 
any associations they have to social 
media. Therefore, if someone posts 
inappropriate comments online, his 
or her identity will remain associ-
ated with the comment as Google 
can easily scavenge and present it in 
a search result. In many cases, it is a 
service that could be well utilized by 
prospective employers.  According to 
the New York Times, there were 57 
accusations of sexual misconduct in 
New York City schools, and several 
of those accused were found to have 
been accountable for previous cases. 
So long as these individuals appear 
on the news for committing such 
behavior, their names and past 
transgressions are easily search-
able on Google. Comprehensive 
internet results have the potential 
to prevent problems by giving 
employers more background on 
their prospective hires. 

Thus, access to this kind of infor-
mation can help detect potential 
social hazards. Despite the privacy 
implications, it’s better to avoid 
exposing other employees, students 
and society in general to harm.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Today, concerns about global 

warming have spiked. We have been 
affected by high or capricious tem-
perature change in San Diego. How 
can we reduce some causes of global 
warming? 

This is a serious matter. Some of 
the areas around the world are hav-
ing imminent threats from global 
warming, such as rising sea levels, 
extreme changes of weather or fre-
quent wild fires. However, we can 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
that cause global warming. Most of 
San Diego’s greenhouse gas emis-
sion comes from transportation.

Our school has a high propor-
tion of student commuters, and 
many students live off-campus. 
Recently, I heard free bus stickers 
will require fees for next quarter. I 
personally think the school should 
cover free bus stickers for students. 
The mass transportation around 
the school is not great, but it is 
essential for those who live off-
campus. Providing free bus stickers 
will definitely drop the greenhouse 
gas emission from transportation

Secondly, we should change our 
school buses to be more eco-friend-
ly. The shuttle buses that loop our 
school are a bit old and are diesel-
powered buses.

To make the air cleaner and 
clearer, we need to change our 
buses to natural gas-powered or 
electric-powered to sustain our 
clean environment. Also, increas-
ing the price of parking permits is 
a way to reduce single-occupancy 
vehicles to school. 

As the number of single-occu-
pancy vehicles rises, the greenhouse 
emissions spike as well. The school 
should promote car pools and mass 
transportation system.

Other UC universities like 
Irvine earned accolades for its 
eco-friendly measures. UC Irvine 
promoted green initiatives through 
student groups that promote envi-
ronmentally friendly measures. 
As a student of UCSD, I think our 
school should also heavily pro-
mote its pro-environment student 
groups. If our student groups do 
not have enough budget and power, 
it will definitely lead to a lack of 
interest for the students.

arren College senior Kirsten 
Koa’s childhood was filled with 
various Nintendo and com-
puter games. A kid at heart, 
Koa’s interests in gaming led 

her toward choosing computer science as 
her major. After several 
internships, a number 
of corgi gaming appli-
cations and four years 
of hard work, Koa’s 
passions have resulted 
in a full-time starting 
position at Google and 
department recognition 
for her work in com-
puter science. This year, 
Koa has been selected 
as the recipient of the 
Computer Science 
and Engineering 
Department’s 2014 
Excellence Award.

The recipient of the 
annual award, a mem-
ber of the UCSD gradu-
ating class, is selected 
by computer science 
advising counselors and 
faculty. Koa will receive 
the award at the Ring 
Ceremony on Saturday, 
June 14 at 8:15 p.m. in 
Warren Mall.

Koa’s resume boasts 
extensive experience 
with internships, vary-
ing from unpaid research positions to spots 
on teams in larger companies like Qualcomm 
and Microsoft. In summer 2012, she worked 
at Qualcomm on gesture commands, and in 
2013, she worked at Irvine-based company 

MobilityWare on mobile game features and 
animations. Before landing her full-time posi-
tion at Google last November, Koa spent her 
summer in Seattle working for Microsoft on 
technical projects. 

The award marks Koa’s four-year long 
journey in computer 
science that all began 
with her first pro-
gramming course at 
UCSD, CSE 8A with 
professor Rick Ord. 
She recounts that 
jumping into com-
puter science had not 
been the smoothest of 
introductions. 

“I remember get-
ting a ‘C’ on my first 
midterm, and it real-
ly challenged me to 
step up my game,” 
Koa said. “I realized 
I really had to start 
reading the book, and 
I even starting doing 
some programming 
problems and tutori-
als online.” 

This opened her 
eyes to the problem-
solving side of com-
puter science and how 
that requires both 
knowledge and cre-
ativity from the pro-
grammer. 

“What I love about computer science is 
that I can make things,” Koa said. “It’s creative, 
and now I feel capable of building things I 
want to build.”

For Koa, app-building started with class

On any warm, sunny afternoon, while strolling through the Student Services Center court-yard, one can look up and see flags depicting famous UCSD 
alumni and where their dreams and education 
have led them. For many of UCSD’s current 
students, making a comparable impact on 
society can seem like an attractive but daunt-
ing goal. For junior transfer student Allen 
Theweny, a political science major from Muir 
College and mayoral candidate for the city of 
El Cajon, a quote he looks to for inspiration 
came from Harriet Tubman: “Every great 
dream begins with a dreamer. Always remem-
ber that you have within you the strength, the 
patience and the passion to reach for the stars 
to change the world.”

Theweny was born and raised in El 
Cajon, home to the second largest Chaldean-
American population in our country. His par-
ents emigrated from Iraq in 1991 in the midst 
of the Gulf War bombings, and Theweny 
admires the foundation they established 
despite coming to America with very little to 
start with. Once a math teacher, his father now 
owns several small businesses in El Cajon, 
including a gas station and convenience store. 

Theweny said that his father’s hard work and 
the way he shaped Theweny’s childhood was 
a significant influence on his own character.

“He made me learn what hard work is,” 
Theweny said. “He’d send me to work every 
day after school and during breaks, changing 
oil in a mechanic shop, picking up the floors, 
mopping at the convenience stores.”

It was Theweny’s dedication and love 
for his community, which has faced racial 
opposition for being a minority in El Cajon, 
that drove the 21-year-old to run for city 
council office.

“I remember growing up … hear[ing] 
people complain, and when they’d go to city 
council they’d be shut down … and, you know, 
I notice a lot of anger toward that,” Theweny 
said. “What actually happened last May was 
[mayor Mark Lewis] made some disparaging 
remarks against our community as well as 
other minority communities, like Latinos and 
African-Americans ... I think El Cajon doesn’t 
have room for ignorance like that anymore. It’s 
a big thing that needs to change.”

From a well-informed citizen’s perspec-
tive, Theweny explained the issues he sees in 
El Cajon and the solutions he would like to 
set in action. Encouraging small businesses

projects before jumping into apps made purely for fun. 
In her CSE 110 class, Software Engineering, her team 
designed a nutrition app to help her professor with his 
Zone diet. Using those tools she learned from the class, 
she was inspired to create “Hungry Corgis” and “Corgi 
Memory” — two free Android and iOS apps featuring her 
Instagram-famous dog, Ventus the Corgi. Now, shxe and 
a group of friends are currently developing an app named 
“Selfie Showdown,” designed to help users take selfies. 

Koa believes that the UCSD computer science and 
engineering department is very supportive and stresses 
having a supportive community. Koa explained that the 
encouragement she received from her tutors while taking 
introductory classes is a major reason why she has contin-
ued to tutor for Ord’s classes for the past three years. 

“Rick [Ord] always says to form study groups, so one 
day in 8A, I looked to the person on my left and the person 
on my right, and I asked them, ‘Hey, do you want to study 
for the quiz next week?’” Koa said. “And now we have taken 
a lot of our computer science classes together, and it’s really 
impacted my experience here. Just because Rick said to 
form study groups, we ended up just being like, ‘Hey you’re 
really cool,’ and we’ve been best friends ever since.”

Koa believes that UCSD’s greater emphasis on expe-
riential learning than most schools has shaped her as an 
engineer. At UCSD, “apply to internships” is almost like a 
mantra, Koa explained, with faculty members repeatedly 
encouraging students to apply and to attend job fairs despite 
rejections or difficulties landing that first internship. 

“I learned so much from my internships,” Koa said. 
“Not just about engineering but about what kind of work 
do I want to do [and] what makes me happy. I learned 

more stuff about myself and where I want to be, and those 
kinds of things you wouldn’t just learn from going to class 
all the time.”

Those different work environments opened her eyes 
to the importance of team dynamics. Being a woman was 
never an obstacle for Koa; however, she did note a dispar-
ity in gender participation. Though she never faced any 
outright discrimination for being a woman in computer 
science, in two of her internships, she was the only female 
on the team. 

“I’ve learned that you shouldn’t be discouraged that 
there aren’t that many women in the field,” Koa said. “It 
makes you stand out and feel special, but being a woman 
should not feel like a handicap.” 

Through a Facebook-sponsored scholarship, Koa was 
able to attend the Grace Hopper Convention, an annual 
event held for female engineers. 

Koa said she wished she could have attended the annual 
convention every year and advises other women to take 
advantage of the convention and the UCSD student orga-
nization, Women in Computing, for opportunities to feel 
empowered as well as to network with other women in 
the field. 

After graduation, Koa is excited to return home to the 
Bay Area and join Google as a software engineer in the fall. 
Meanwhile, in between sleeping and relaxing, computer 
science will continue to be a part of Koa’s life.

“I’m excited to have this summer to relax and wake up 
not knowing what day of the week it is,” Koa said laughing. 
“It’ll be great, but I also plan to work on another corgi game 
and some other applications for fun.”

Award Winner Believes that Being a Woman Should Not Be an 
Obstacle for Aspiring Female Computer Scientists and Engineers

to spring up in the notoriously quiet 
town is one way Theweny wants to 
battle unemployment. His other con-
cern is the high sales tax which he 
believes damages the local economy. 

“You can’t discourage small busi-
ness,” Theweny said. “That’s how you 
create jobs. El Cajon has a 10-per-
cent unemployment rate — very high 
unemployment rate. So [when] you 
have a high unemployment rate and 
a high sales tax, it makes it really dif-
ficult for people to live there.”

Theweny also values his education 
and holds that he would like to see 
more opportunities for the children 
in El Cajon. He asserts that UCSD 
provided a unique chance for him to 
grasp an understanding of perspec-
tives different from his own, spe-
cifically through the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion course requirement. 

“I wouldn’t say that before I was 
ignorant or anything like that, but it 
just kind of taught you to be more 
accepting of other people, whether 
it be their race, their gender, their 
sexual orientation or anything like 
that,” Theweny said. “You really get a 
sense of who they are and why they 
choose to be the way they [are], and 
it’s a really good class.”

For other students seeking a path 
into local government, Theweny says 
it doesn’t take more than a bit of asser-
tion: anyone is welcome to attend the 
city council meetings in their town 
and express their ideas and concerns. 
He obtained his past internships with 
previous mayoral candidate Nathan 
Fletcher and Congressman Duncan 
Hunter (R-California) by sending an 
email to their coordinators express-
ing his interest in their campaigns.

“Find a project in your city that 
you really want to do,” Theweny 
said. “If there’s something that[’s] 
not being done, go to city council, 
tell them, ‘What are you guys doing 
about it?’ Find something you’re pas-
sionate about.”

No dream is out of reach for 
Theweny, who smiled during the 
interview when declaring that his 
ultimate goal is to eliminate racism 
entirely from the community.

“I know it’s a huge goal, [but] you 
can have individuals that can really 
make a huge difference like Martin 
Luther King [Jr.],” Theweny said. “My 
hope is just to lead by example and 
hopefully, over the years people will 
follow that example.”

The 2013 Gatorade Alaska 
Basketball Player of the Year took no 
time making an impact on the men’s 
basketball team in his first year as 
a Triton. Klie immediately found 
himself in the rotation, starting in 
half of the season’s contests and 

averaging 28 minutes per game. 
Klie ended the season with the 
third highest point total with 262, 
behind senior James McCann and 
sophomore Drew Dyer, averaging 
10.1 points per game off a team-
best .492 field-goal percentage. 
Outside of offense, Klie averaged 3.7 
rebounds per game, dished out 38 
assists and picked off 23 steals. To 
top it all off, Klie earned the CCAA’s 
Freshman of the Year award to 

highlight a stellar rookie year. With 
senior James McCann graduating, 
Klie looks poised to take over for 
the Triton basketball program and 
take it to new territory over the next 
three years.

every graduating Triton. Lizotte racks 
up the goals, but she also serves as 
the core voice and heart of one of the 

best water polo teams in the nation. 
In short, she knows the game and she 
knows how to lead. Lizotte told the 
Guardian she chose UCSD above a 
host of Division I universities because 
she wanted to make a lasting impact. 
In four short years, she has not only 
made an impact but has shaped the 
face of the Triton program.

WE ARE ADIVASIS: ASPIRATION IN AN INDIAN 
SCHEDULED TRIBE – SOCIAL SCIENCES BUILDING, 
ROOM 107
We Were Adivasis is an ethnography of collective aspiration 
among a marginalized urban community known as the Dhanka 
in Jaipur City, Rajasthan, India. The Dhanka are a Scheduled 
Tribe, that is, a group recognized by the Constitution of India as 
original inhabitants (often referred to as “Adivasis”) of the 
subcontinent who are entitled to affirmative action quotas in 
legislatures, educational institutions, and government 
employment by virtue of their unique cultural practices and in 
recognition of centuries of oppression at the hands of 
non-tribals. We Were Adivasis argues that the Dhanka, like 
other tribal communities in India, must undertake a great deal 
of imaginative work to occupy the tribal role through which 
they are recognized as worthy and needy of affirmative action 
benefits. This ethnography brings the reader into that 
imaginative work by exploring a range of settings, from 
intimate household interactions to tribal council meetings to 
historical narratives to group wedding festivals, and highlights 
what Dhanka women and men hope and strive for in each. 
Moodie argues that collective aspiration is a highly gendered 
process requiring very different dreams and dispositions for 
men and women, both of which are essential to the 
community’s ability to invent and articulate alternative visions 
for the future and to move away from the stigma of 
Adivasi-ness, a state that becomes tentatively relegated to the 
past: we were Adivasis. Megan Moodie is Assistant Professor 
of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, 
where she studies the sociality engendered by legal and 
economic projects for uplift and empowerment, including 
affirmative action, microfinance, and gender-based rights 
assertions. Her forthcoming book, We Were Adivasis: 
Aspiration in an Indian Scheduled Tribe, will appear in the 
South Asia Across the Disciplines Series with the University of 
Chicago Press in 2015.

Of the hundreds of contests throughout the 2013–
14 UCSD athletic year, it speaks volumes when our 
choice for the Game of the Year was a Triton loss. 
Despite the bitter outcome of the women’s basketball 
team’s 68–67 overtime loss to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, the game was a classic. On Spirit Night, the 
Tritons found themselves down 17 points with just 
over 11 minutes remaining. However, UCSD crafted a 
miraculous comeback, going on a 22–5 run, to knot the 
game up at 55. The Toros retook the lead with a layup, 
and the Tritons were once again down a score with only 
0.4 seconds remaining. With less than a half second, 
Stephanie Yano inbounded the ball to Megan Perry, 
who nailed a 10-foot jumper to send the game into extra 
time and send the jam-packed arena into a frenzy. The 
Tritons failed to win in overtime, but the game was one 
for the record books.

OUTSTANDING TEAM

MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR GAME OF THE YEAR

FEMALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR

The Triton baseball team claimed its sixth California 
Collegiate Athletic Association title in 2014 after achieving 
a regular season record of 38–16. The team further 
distinguished itself by advancing to the final round of 
the Division II NCAA Western Regionals before being 
narrowly ousted by Chico State. On the field, the bullpen 
produced a 3.23 ERA compared to opponents’ 6.29 ERA, 
while Triton bats averaged .294 at the plate over their 
opponents’ average of .253 at bat. Outside of collective 
success, individual players were recognized on local, 

regional and national levels for their talents on the field and 
in the classroom, as several Tritons qualified for numerous 
First Team selection honors. In a season full of ups and 
downs, the Tritons consistently came up in the clutch and 
stood out as the best squad in the past year for UCSD.

BEST CHAMPIONSHIP PERFORMANCE

For the 
s e c o n d 
straight year, 
the UCSD 
Guardian has 
chosen Sarah 
Lizotte as 
the Female 
Athlete of 
the Year, but 
the repeated 
honor comes with good reason. The 
senior utility of the women’s water 
polo squad led the Tritons yet again in 
goals (84), tied for most in assists (51) 
and topped a number of other statisti-

cal categories. She was Western Water 
Polo Association Player of the Year 
for the second season in a row, lift-
ing UCSD to its third straight NCAA 
Championship Finals appearance. 
Early in her final year as a Triton, 
Lizotte netted her 246th goal to shat-
ter the UCSD all-time scoring record, 
previously held by former Olympic 
silver medalist and U.S. national team 
captain Julie Ertel. Ever since Lizotte 
arrived at UCSD, she has distin-
guished herself athletically from the 
rest, and this year was no different.  

THE BEST OF
TRITON ATHLETICS

2013 – 2014 THE GUARDIAN HONORS 

In the final year of his amazing 
Triton career, Korth went out with 
a bang, taking the NCAA Division 
II, national-champion title in the 
200-meter breaststroke in March. 
His time of 1 minute, 54.45 seconds 
shattered the Division II national and 
UCSD school record. As for the rest 
of his national performances, Korth 
took third in the 100 breaststroke, 
breaking his own school record; he 
swam in a school record-breaking, 
fourth place-finish in the 200 free 
relay; he and his relay team broke 

the school record in the 200 medley 
relay; and he ended with five All-
American performances to make him 
an 18-time All-American. For his 
elite efforts in the water, Korth is 
not only a national champion on the 
podium but also our pick for Male 
Athlete of the Year.

BASEBALL IN THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP

Despite falling short of qualifying 
for the NCAA Nationals, the baseball 
team’s clutch and memorable games in the 
CCAA Tournament gets our nod for the 
Best Championship Performance. Coming 
in as the No. 3 seed, the Tritons were 5–3 
victors in their opener against Chico State 
with the help of a late double by senior 
Garrett Tuck. The Tritons would come 
through the clutch again in the following 
game against Cal Poly Pomona. Senior 
catcher Nick La Face hit a walk-off, two-
out runs batted in double in the 11th to 
bring in Eric Lewis with the dramatic 
slide at home for the walk-off victory. The 
championship game was another classic 
rematch against Chico State. With the 
scores tied 7–7 in the seventh, the Tritons 
capitalized on the Wildcats’ errors and 
had two RBIs from Lewis and freshman 
Jack Larsen to reclaim their fifth CCAA 
Championship Banner in six years.

SWIMMING AND DIVING

The best coaches come out with 
the best results, and for the 2013–14 
season, Falcon and Macedo pushed 
the UCSD 
swimming and 
diving team 
to achieve 
incredible feats. 
The men’s 
and women’s 
squads both 
finished first 
overall at the Pacific Coast Super Cup 
league championships before moving 
onto the NCAAs, where the women 
finished fifth in the nation while the 
men earned the seventh best results 
in the country. In total, the Tritons 
had a whopping 41 All-American 
distinctions at nationals and broke 
seven school records. And, perhaps 

most admirable of all, two national 
champions and seniors Nicholas 
Korth (200-meter breaststroke) and 

Anji Shakya (500 
freestyle) swam 
under Falcon 
and Macedo’s 
guidance this 
season. The past 
campaign was 
only the third 
coaching year 

for both Falcon and Macedo, and 
their expertise and mentorship will 
only continue to elevate the Triton
