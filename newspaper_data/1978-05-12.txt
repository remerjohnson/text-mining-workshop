John Jenkel yesterday 
overcame a narrow deficit in 
last week's first round of the AS 
presidential elections to beat 
his opponent Gary Moser and 
capture the presidency. 

Jenkel emphasized during 
the campaign that he would 
promote a serious government 
concentrating on academic 
issues, while Moser spoke often 
about the need for a Beer Pub 
and a better "quality of life" on 
campus. The students bought 
Jenkel's argument, as they 
ga ve him 744 votes or 53 .7 
percent in yesterday's runoff 
election. 

According to his supporters, 
Jenkel was at the Bratskellar 
last night, presumably cele-
brating his victory, and he was 
unavailable for comment. 

In the vice-presidential 
runoff Jenkel's running mate . 
Ann Carberry held on to her 
first round lead to defeat Bill 
Silva. Carberry picked up 60.5 
percent of the vote to Silva's 
39.4. 

In winning the Commis ioner 
of Communications post, Bill 
Friedman took 52.6 percent of 
the vote to James Montgom-
ery's 47.3 percent. 

In the race for the Commis-
sioner of Appointments and 
Evaluations position, Marlene 

Peterson edged out Bill Topkis 
with Peterson taking 51.8 
percent and Topkis getting 48.1 
percent. 

The results were announced 
last night at 8 o ' clock by 
Elections Commissioner Lori 
Dority. According to Dority the 
voting yesterday went smooth-
ly, with an 18.6 percent turnout., 

Happiness and respect 
Carberry said last niJ.ht she 

was very " happy" With the 
results . 

"The students have shown 
that they are interested in a 
serious government ," said 
Carberry. 

Moser said last night, " I 

full y . I support Joh n a nd I 
support the AS." 

Clean sweep 
With Jenkel and Carberry's 

victories yesterday coupled 
with Commissioner of Aca-
demic Affairs-elect Margot 
Tempereau's in the first round 
last week, Jenkel 's slate took :l 
clean sweep. 

In addition to his own slate, 
Jenkel, along with Friedman

The · tales of an election 
Spicer charged 

by Eric Jaye 
Staff Writer . 

Student Organizations Advisor Scot Spicer 
has been charged by a group of AS leaders 
and a Student Affairs employee with covertly 
supporting former AS Presidential candidate 
Gary Moser's campaign. 

Both Moser and Spicer have denied the 
charges. 

AS officers met with Acting Vice-
chancellor of Student Affairs Howard Hunt 
and Spicer Wednesday afternoon to discuss 
the charges and agreed not to reveal what 
had taken place there. However, many of the 
participants had spoken to the Triton Times 
beforehand, giving some information about 
the charges being levelled against Spicer. 

AS President Jeff Leifer said Tuesday he 
helped organize the meeting because he was 
"concerned" about the way Spicer was 
handlin, the elections. 

"I think there have been some serious 
indicators that would suggest a strong Spicer-
Moeer link," said Leifer. . 

However, Leifer was careful to warn that 
he would not make a Judlment until there W88 
lOme "substantiation." 

C.trol 
Leifer said that lOme of his "concern" 

came as a reault of certain statements Spicer 
had made to personnel of the Student Affairs 
Office. 

One employee of the Student Affairs Office 
told the Triton Times that Spicer had made

Lofgren s9rry' 
by Mark Stadler 

Senior Editor 
A letter appeared on page two of last 

Wednesday's Triton Times endorsing Jim 
Lofgren's candidacy for AS Commissioner of 
External Affairs. The letter was signed by, 
among other people, AS Muir College 
Representative Kevin Eckery. 

No big deal. After all, a whole lot of 
endorsement letters have appeared recently 
in the Triton Times. 

Except that Eckery's signature on the 
Lofgren letter was forged . 

And within the confines of this controversy, 
which some would call the result of 
carelessness and others of minor league 
chicanery, lies an .example of what can 
happen in a political campaign. Wrapped in 
the scenario are such factors as political 
maneuverin" shifting alliances and the 
importance 0 timing. 

The Lofgren endorsement letter merely 
served as a focal point for one of the many 
such vignettes of the just-concluded AS 
campailn.

This story was written by 
Senior Editor Mark Stadler, 
with information compiled by 
himself, Eric Jaye and Andy 
Schneider. 

Day Care supporters believe 
such a move will cause a 
lowering in the quality of the 
day care program here, and 
will also cause a hike in 
parents' fees, which are now 
$150 a month. Day Care parents 
have instead offered to pay $20

They then prepared for the

Mark Stadle 
Dr. l' ompson 

It was 8: 15 pm last Tuesday evening at the San Diego Airport. 
We - my.elf, a TT photograpber and two students from 
University Events - were waiting (or the 8: 30 plane that was to 
bring us Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, the famed gonzo journalist 
scheduled to speak at UCSD that night. 

Then we got the phone call: Dr. Thompson will not be here until 
7:55. . 

We knew it we muttered to ourselves. He missed his plane. The 
twisted. unreliable geek is going to live up to his image and stand 
us up. With 700 howling students waiting at the Revelle Cafeteria 
(or him. 

As it turned out, o( course. Thompson's 6: 30 plane was 
cancelled. So it wasn't his (ault - I guess. The rest, as we all know 
now. is history. 

••••• 
Regardless o( what anyone who saw him last Tuesday may think 

- and I don't blame them for feeling that way, after paying $2.50 to 
hear a wasted lunatic rave for less than an hour. although he was 
jut responding to the crowd's tone - Thompson does have two 
redeeming qualities. First, he is a very good writer, who tries to 
tell the truth about things as he views them. Anyone who has read 
his work will surely attest to this judgment. 

Second. Thompson is a man of rare courage. He has made a 
literal profession of delving into what we fear most in life. then 
r,esting the sources of those fears to find the limits of his courage. 
.-Ie rode with the Hell's Angels off-and-on for over a year'. was 
stomped at one point. yet lived to write about it. He went to Las 
Vegas. and broke all the accepted/rules of conduct- basically just 
to see what would happen - and survived. There are many more 
examples of this type of testing. scattered throughout his writing. 

••••• 
One of the main questions I wanted answered during my 

interview and subsequent contact with Thompson was whether he 
is for real? - does he possibly act in real life the way he acts in his 
writing? After a short interview. it's impossible to really say, but it 
does appear as if the answer to the question is a hesitant yes. 

He does talk just like he writes. The session with the students 
would be a " fucking King Kong nutkicker. " he had predicted 
before we arrived on campus. He had to return immediately to LA 
because Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner is going to run for 
president with Jack Ford. and "it's too weird to miss ." 

He does drink Wild Turkey on stage . He does do a lotof drugs. or 
at least he talks and acts that way . In short. either he isn' t putting 
on an act for the public. or he has been putting people on for such a 
long time - acting the way he thinks people want him to act - that 
the public character has become part of the private man.

Letters to the editor 
Criticism of te_aching necessary 

Dr. Bebar: prematurely will adversely affect the readi", . 
After class, Monday. May 8, I complained about 

your babit of divul,in, tbe endln,s of novels, 
prematurely. Your first res~e was. " I assume 

• everyone has rud the book.' When I dared to press 
the discussion, you completely lost control of yourself 

The first day you lectured on Tess of the 
D'Urbervllles, you told us that at the end sbe was to be 
•••. It was a little unreasonable to assume that 
everyone had read 330 pa,es in two days. Any ,limmer 
of hope that Tess and An,el would ...... was 
meaningless because we already knew the outcome. and further discussion was impossible. D.H. Lawrence's Women In Love is reserved for the 
end of the course, but you told us how it was to end on 
tbe very first day of c1as •. Is it reasonable to assume 
we had read a book nine weeks before it was to be 
assil!ned? 

If you assumed we bad already read Conrad's Tbe 
Secret A,ent , wby did you advise us to read it slowly, 
carefully, and to underline passa,es pertaining to 
darkness? The fact that Verloc was to be •••• at the 
end, was not relevant to your lectures and undermined 
the power of the novel . An anecdote I once heard in a 
folklore class may help illustrate my point about 

You argue that my complaint is unimportant. 
Therefore, it follows that reading novels in a logical 
order, enjoying the eCCect the author worked so hard to 
create, and derivini a little more pleasure from the 
course are all unimportant. Even if that were the case, 
(and I believe I have shown that it is not) the 
complaint. at the very least, has some bearing on 
teaching style. Acknowledging that complaint would 
help you avoid oCCending students and would make 
your lectures both better integrated and more 

relevance: . 
" A man was lecturing at a convention. The subject 

was about solar heating and he wanted to fit in the only joke be knew .. . about shotguns. So. in the middle of the 
lecture, he shouted, 'BANG!! Did someone hear a 
shot? Oh! incidentaly , that reminds me of a joke .. . '" 

The point is obvious, so I will go on. 
Endinis are important. not only as surprises. but as 

resolutions, solutions and summaries. Endings are 
placed at the end for a reason. and knowing tbe end

Day care issues tossed around 
Editor: 

As a parent and a student, I must 
respond to the fictions presented by 
R. Whitehill in the TT of 5/5/78. In 
fact: 

I. Palo Alto franchise educational 
" program" is analogous to getting 
a mail order PhD. It is legal, but not 
recognized or accredited as 
educational by the State Dept. of 
Education, and is far below the 
standards at eight other UC Day 
Care Centers. 

2. Fees with the franchise would 
increase for most parents. The bid 
received by the Chancellor's Office 
would raise infant care from 
$150/ mo . to $225/mo . Whitehill 
characterized infant care as the 
most pressing need for student 
parents, yet he promotes pricing it 
out of the range of students while 
decreasing staff. In addition, there 
are increased fees for all the half-
time chil dren , whose parents 
sought to minimize their child·care 
exoenses. 

3. In the proposed budget using 
the present model , 30 student / 
parent fees would be subsidized by 

the State Dept. of Education, in 
recognition of the quality of the 
model. 

R. Whitehill, in effect, prefers to 
deny 30 students outside funding . 
and to deny services offered at 
other UC camp\lses . Instead , 
minimal babysitting is offered at up 
to a 50 percent increase in fees , and 

for those students who qualify for 
fuJI state subsidy this represents a 
greater than 50 percent decrease in 
service for a 150 percent increase in 
cost . I

Teaching •.• 
(Continued from page 2) 

An open-minded professor can learn as much from 
his studentsas they should learn from him. (IdeaJly, at 
any rate.) But when communication finally breaks 
down to the point that a student'S suggestion is termed 
"stupid", when it disintegrates so far that the student 
remains calm and objective while it is the instructor 
who resorts to anger and shouting, when it falls to the 
point that a complaint which would help the 
IDstructor's lectures, if heeded, is taken as a personal 
affront , then teaching becomes one -sided and 
frustrating. 

I have voiced my opinion and that of several, if not 
many of my classmates. The fact that only I have had 
the effrontery to approach you dpes not mean the 

problem is nonexistant. For instance, when you 
divulged the ending of Women In Love, a sirl sitting 
beside me whispered, " I feel lOrry for anyone who has 
not read the book. He just ruined it ." And when you 
gave away Tess's fate, the disgusted groans were 
audible all over the room. Perhaps no one has 
approached you because of the feared consequences: 
harsher grading, unwanted attentlon ... even delayed 
graduation . Whatever the reason for the silence, you 
do weaken your lecture with this unfortunate habit, 
s tudents are unhappy, and therefore there Is a 
problem. As you well know, you have the prerogative 
to resolve the problem, or ignore it. My responsibility 
is to make you aware of that problem and I was a little 
surprised at being called "stupid" for fulfilling that 
responsibility. "Thank you" would have been more

Netmen' battle for District III title

fos the men's tennis team 
travels to Redlands for the 
NAJA District III finals this 
weekend their sights seem to be 
set more towards the upcoming 
NCAA National Championships 
May 17-20. It 's no wonder . 
Triton chances for doing well at 
the national tourney , to be held 
at Wesleyan College in Dela-
ware, Ohio are good. 

Both doubles teams, Heinl 
Broudy and Metsch/Gerdsen, ' 
have a good shot at the doubles 
crown, For the season, Heinl 
Broudy have an 11-9 record. 
"These two really play well · 
together. Bill Hein is very 
tenacious, he really hangs in 
there, " complimented Yama-
guchi. Metsch/Gerdsen have 
compiled a 5-6 record together. 

top position , Including Red-
lands, La Verne , Pomona -
Pitzer, Occidental and Whit-

The team has compiled an 
overall season record of 12 wins 
and 10 losses, with the bulk of 
the competition being against 
NCAA Division J and II schools.

In order for the entire team to 
advance to the NAJA Nationals, 
they will have to win the whole 
thing this weekend. Chanc~s of 
winning, thou~h, are margmal. 
" We won't fiDlsh below third," 
predicted Yamaguchi . There 
are twelve teams vying for the 

If an individual wins the 
singles title and he is not from 
the school that wins the overall 
finals , he is entitled to go to the 
nationals . The same is also true 
for doubles. With three players 
seeded in the top ten, Metsch, 
Gerdsen and Hein, the outlook 
is favorable. Add to this the fact 
that UCSD hasn't lost to any 
NAJA school this year, except 
Redlands . With the team 's 
talent and a little bit of luck this 
may be the year for UCSD's 
men's tennis.

Alei , Bob Owsley and Tom 
Hughes rowed their way to a

"The heavywdght had to 
borrow a boat so they were

De onstrators take 
McElroy's office ... 

(Continued rom page 1) 
sleeping ags. boa rd games 
and a big pot of spalhettL They 
also took up a collection of 
money for more food. 

A campus police officer was 
stationed at one entrance to the 
office, and refused entrance to 
any person who showed up after 
5:00 pm. 

Campus police chief Hugh 
French said yesterday he 
"understood" McElroy wants 
the demonstrators moved out of 
his office by 5: 00 this afternoon. 

After - calling the advisory 
committee into its emergency 
meeting Wednesday, McElroy 
left his office at about 11: 45 am, 
apparently to go to lunch . 
However, he did not return to 
his office all afternoon. 

At 12: 45 pm, the Triton Times 
contacted McElroy at his 
home, where he said he would 
not return to his office that day. 
He said he had another office on 
campus where he could move to 
while the demonstrators 
occupied his office. 

" I'm not going to come back 
(to my office). That's the 
'eason I have a police force 
wer there," McElroy said. 

McElroy 's absence from 
!ampus Monday caused 
!onsternation for both the 
ldvisory committee and the )ay Care supporters . The 
mpporters said McElroy had 
;old them that he would go 
lefore the advisory committee 
;0 support the Reg Fee funding 
:or Day Care. 

The supporters also said 
McElroy told them he would 
iirect the advisory committee 
to hold its meeting at the 
Chancellor'S office, before the 
demonstrators themselves. 

When the advisory commit-
tee met Wednesday afternoon, 
committee co-chair Rick 
Whitehill , the deputy student 
affairs vice-chancellor, said 
McElroy did not indicate where 
the meeting should ~ h~ld . The 
meeting was held ID the 
committee 's usual meeting 
place, the Vice-chancellor 's 
conference room in Building B 
of the Student Center, with ten 
committee members and about 
25 spectators present. 

Asked why the meeting was 
not held in McElroy's office, 
Whitehill said the demonstra-
tors could come to the meetinll 
if they desired. 

Several committee members 
:laid they were not happy' that 
McElroy would call an emer-

. gency committee meeting then 
not attend the meeting. 

Whitehill read a statement 
from McElroy about the day 
care issue, which said in part 
that McElroy considers a 
budget request of $17 ,000 
" unconscionably high", but if 
the committee approves such 
an allocation he would accept 
it. 

IC the committee chooses to 
reject the allocation, McElroy 
said he will accept that 
decision, also. 

In response to this, Third 
College Provost Joseph 
Watson, a committee member, 
said McElroy's statement was 
no different than his past 

position on Day Care funding . 
He a dded tha t the $17 ,000 
budget request came from the 
Budget Office, which, since it is 
an administrative office, works 
for McElroy. 

"What else can we do, except 
the same thing as last week 
(when the committee rejected 
the fundin~) , or not even hold a 
vote at all, ' Watson said. 

Student member Kenzie 
Nicoll said the committee 
should make its own suggestion 
on the level of funding for the 
Day Care Center. 

Whitehill disagreed with this, 
saying the committee had not 
tried to set a fee level for any 
other campus group, but had 
always worked from budget 
recommendations they were 
given by the groups and the 
Business Office. 

Watson then proposed that 
the committee ask McElroy to 
come to its next meeting, next 
Monday morning at 8: 00 

and give the committee a 
-day care budget request he 
finds "conscionable." . 

After approving Watson's 
motion, Whitehill and student 
co-chair Marsha Harris went to 
McElroy's office to explain 
what the committee did and to 
talk with the demonstrators. 
While they were at McElroy's 
office, a dialogue ensued, with 
the demonstrators shouting 
questions and comments at 
Whitehill and Harris, who 
answered them in level tones. 

Day Care parent Mike Gibbs 
asked if McElroy has the power 
to override the advisory 
committee, if the Chancellor 
could on his own allocate 
$25,000 of reg fee money to the 
Day Care Center? 

Harris replied that McElroy 
does have that power, and 
added that the demonstrators 
should be angry at McElroy, 
not at the committee. McElroy 
told Day Care supporters he 
was seeking alternative form~ 
of funding all this year, when in 
reality he wasn't putting much 
effort into the search, Harris 
said. 

"McElroy told us it was all 
the committee's fault, and you 
tell us it's all his fault," one 
demonstrator said in reply to 
Harris. 

The demonstrator s also 
asked Whitehill and Harris if 
they had consi dered the 
petitions, in support of day care 
on campus, which, they said, 
were signed by 4000 students. 

Harris answered that the 
positions did not i nform 
students their Reg Fees. might 
be raised if the Day Care Center 
was funded . She said she had 
offered to have a referendum 
item placed on yesterday's AS 
election ballot, to solicit student 
opinion ()n the question, with 
the knowledge that their Reg 
Fee might be raised because of 
such a move. 

But Day Care supporters 
refused to go along with this 
idea, Harris said. 

To this , the demonstrators 
replied that allocation of $25,000 
for the center is hardly enough 
in itself to cause a hike in Reg 
Fees.

Tales of ·the election ... 
Spicer. .. 
(Continued from page 1) 
statements indicating thai he supported 
Moser's candidacy. 

This employee said, " One person asked 
Scot who he would like to see win the election 
and he said that he thought Gary Moser 
because he thought Gary would be easier to 
control. " 

Invalidation? 
Elections Commissioner Lori Dority said 

that she also had some complaints about 
Spicer's involvement in the election. 

Dority said, "Scot told me flat out that 
Moser was his top priority." 

In addition to Spicer's alleged partisonship, 
Dority said that she took issue with Spicer's 
attempts to " interfere" with her job. 

" Instead of acting as an advisor, he was 
attempting to act as a supervisor. He didn't 
actually interfere in my job only because I 
wouldn't let him," said Dority. 

Dority continued, " If it can be proven that 
he (Spicer) aided Gary enough to help Gary 
win the election, then the elections could be 
invalidated.' , 

Confidential info 
According to Activity Fee Board Chair Jim 

Atkins, Spicer and Moser had talked about 
(" confidential" campaign information. 

Atkins told the Triton Times, " I 've heard 
Moser and Spicer talking about the campaign 
and strategies in Scot's office. I've heard 
them talking abn confidential campaign 
info that I assume he got from Dority's desk. 
Expenditures and violations and the like." 

Said Atkins, " Scot told me several times 
that he wanted to see Gary win." 

According to Lobbv Annex Director Phil 
Isaac, Spicer told him several times that 
Moser should win the election. 

" Spicer said that he felt Moser had 
something over the Jenkel slate and because 
of that he deserved to win. 

" In my opinion, it is quite irresponsible for 
an administrator so closely tied to -the 
government to be supporting a candidate," 
Issac said. 

After the meeting Wednesday, Hunt said 
that he would meet again with Spicer and the 
students . 

Spicer refused to comment on the meeting, 
citing the agreement made not to talk to the 
press. 

Some of the students present Wednesday 
said, however, that the administrators at the 
meeting had not been" receptive ." One 
student said, " Nothing was resolved." 

According to the students, they plan to go 
back to Hunt after they have gathered more 
information. 

Denials 
Spicer said Tuesday, " I have pot supported 

anyone's campaign." 
According to Spicer, he had encouraged 

many people to " get out and campaign," but 
this, he said, was only to ensure a high voter 
turnout. 

About the chanzes that he had come out and 
supported Moser, Spicer said, " I don 't think 
I've ever told anyone that Gary Moser should 
be president. " 

Spice': did say, " Gary and I have talked 
about his campaign in very general terms. " 
But, according to Spicer, he will talk about 
the election with "anyone who asks." 

Some sources inside the AS government 
who wished not to be identified have said that 
the c harges against Spicer could be 
.. politically motivated." 

These sources point out that all of those who 
have come forward and accused Spicer of 
partisanship are known Jenkel supporters. 

Spicer commented that, "I really don't 
know about people's motivations when they 
go to the press before they come to me. Bltt I 
don 't think that anyone here would want to 
hurt someone at someone else's expense." 

Those students who have spoken out 
against Spicer deny that they are politically 
motivated. 

Though many of the participants in the 
situation are upholding their pledges not to 
talk to the press, and those who do talk often 

. offer contradictory statements, all seem to 
agree that the conflict over Spicer's alleged 
interference in the campaign will continue. 

Lofgren ... 
(Continued from page 1) . 
letter. And Lofgren said Eckery's actions are 
politically motivated , since last week 
Lofgren was suppor:ting John Jenkel - who 
Eckery supported for AS President - and 
this week he switched to Jenkel 's rival , Gary 
Moser. 

The signing of Eckery's name on his letter 
"was an unfortunate mistake. No harm was 
intended," Lofgren said. 

Lofgren, this year ' s Commissioner of 
Appointments and Evaluations, said the use 
of Eckery 's name resulted from a 
misunderstanding in the heat and confusion 
of his campaign. He said he and his campaign 
manager, Peter Vanderwaal, talked to a lot 
of AS officials about possible endorsements. 
When they got around to adding signatures 
to the endorsement letter, Vanderwaal 
mistook Eckery's name for that of Vice-
president Mark Sindler, who, Lofgren said. 
told them they could sign his name to the 
endorsement. 

So Lofgren signed Eckery's name to the 
letter . Eckery was upset with this 
development but accepted his apology last 
week, according to both Lofgren and Eckery. 
Yet this week, Eckery continued to express 
his displeasure, and Lofgren said he is doing 

I so because of the presidential campaign. 
Eckery admitted this , in part, yet said he 

didn't believe Lofgren's statement that the 
use of Eckery's name was a mistake. 

"Jim waffles too much. I just don 't believe 
him," Eckery said. 

Two levels 
Eckery said he pressed the matter on two 

levels - personal and political. On the 
personal level, Eckery said he felt he was 
" screwed" by Lofgren's use of his name on 
the letter, and that he didn't like the feeling. 

On the politicalleYel, Eckery said LoC,ren 
had tried throughout this year, and espeCially 
t)-}iS year's campaign, to "get concessions 
f.-om both sides. He's been playing both sides 
of the fence. He's supported everyone at one 
time or another." 

Eckery also said Lofgren had used the 
name of President Jeff Leifer without 
permission as a signature for another 
endorsement letter, whIch also appeared in 
last Wednesday's Triton Times. 

To this , Loflren said Leifer orilinally 
approved of the idea that LoflTe,. would write 
an endorsement letter, sign Leifer's name to 
it and submit it to the Triton Time . 

"Now," Lofgren said , "Leifer's upset, 
too." 

Leifer, who al80 strongly supported Jenkel 
(or president, refused to comment on the 
issue.
