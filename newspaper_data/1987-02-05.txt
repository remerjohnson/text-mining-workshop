view of Afnca with the lecture . 
"The Africans' A VIew from

University of Cahfornla , San

UCLA offers 
AIDS course 

For the fIrSt time . UCLA IS 
offering a course about AIDS and 
other sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs) whIch WIll 
discuss a wide range of issues. 
including medical , ethical. 
economIC, CIVIl righ ts, SOCIal and 
legal Issues. 

The class, entitled "BIology of 
Sexually Transmitted DIseases." IS 
offered to undergraduates thIS 
quaner 

It is Important for students, as 
educated persons, to be able to 
deal WIth problems that will 
confront them as adults. 
according to Richard W. Sigel, 
UCLA biology professor who 
specializes in genetics. The 
knowledge of AIDS and its 
related diseases is cri ti cal to both 
the mdivid ual and the society 
today, he added . 

Sigel said much research and 
teaching must be done to make 
clear what is known and what IS 
not known. 

Students WIll pamc when 
confronted by these issues, he 
said . because they cannot 
explain the situation . They need 
to get the information that WIll 
make them behave as individuals 
and as members of society 10 the 
most useful way. he added . 

The new class is not a public 

health course nor is it a !>eX 
education course . It will not 
teach students how to avoid 
AIDS or other STDs, but IS a 
liberal arts education coming not 
from a doctor or an expert on 
STDs but from a humamst. 

igel saId that "this class is 
unique in the respect that both 
reachers and "rudents show 
e nth usiasm." 

igel said It was suggested to 
him by his children and 
undergraduate student in his 
genencs courses that he teach a 
whole course on the 
controversIal issues of AIDS and 
other STDs instead of the 
significance of reproduction and 
genencs.

Riley discusses 
'State of Campus' 
By LETICIA CRUZ VILLARREAL 

A potcntial change in the UCSD alcohol policy and thc recent 
loss of student parking spaces to the new faculty lounge under 
construcoon were the major topics discussed by Associated 
Students (AS.) PreSIdent Joh)1 Rile), in his "State of the Campus" 
spee h held Tuesday afternoon at Revelle Plaza. 

Riley SaId that "a small minority on campus, panicularly faculty 
and adm1l1lstrdtors" support a ban on sponsorship of campus 
activltles, such as the un God Festival, by alcoholIC beverage 
companies. uch a ban would also include [he serving of beer at 
T.G 's . 

"By banning alcohol we would baSically see an end to T.G.'s and 
that would be detrimental to the school," Rileysald . He pOinted out 
that most of the funds for the up omingSun God Festival will come 
from alcoholic beverage companies, and added that an increase in 
student fees will be the admil1lstration's first response to the 
absence of funds such a ban would crea te . "Let's not raise student 
fees," Riley stressed, "to satisfy someone's philosophical 
considerations." He then urged the student body to sign the AS. 
petition against a ban on alcoholic beverage company sponsorshi p 
and the serving ofbeeratT.G.'s. The A.S. hasalread ycollected about 
3,000 Signatures. 

The elimination of student parking spaces in the parking lor at 
Mandeville to make way for a new faculty lounge in the face of a 
student parking shonage seemed "planned" and "ludicrous" to 
Riley. who said that a committee was formed by the A.S. whIch is 
"trying to regain Mandeville parking SPOtS lost to the new faculty 
building." Riley also noted that 70 percent ofUCSD parking fees are 
paid by students. 

Riley also announced that a locanon had finally been secured for 
the Sun God Festival (the site of the Sun God statue could not be 
used because of the construction of the faculty lounge). The Sun 
God Festival will be held on Urey Hall field , May 8. ProfeSSIOnal 
game booths will be set up and the A.5. is trying to book "a bIg-name 
band ," RIley said . !ill

Student proposal seeks new 
direction for Third College 
By JOHN SHAW, Scmelr SIlIJj \.linin 

A proposal designed to 
"revitalize" ThIrd College was 
ubmitted to the Third College 

Student Council , last Monday, by 
rwo Third College Student 
JudIcial Board members. The 
proposal submitted on behalf of 
Third College students, faculty 
and staff comes in the wake of 
Third's "Back to the Basics" 
program held a week ago last 
Monday. 

The proposal addresses the 
direction ThIrd College will take 
in the future, an aspect that 
some feel was not addressed by 
the program. 

The three part proposal calls 
for a pamphlet 10 be produced 
that would summarize Third's 
history from its inception to the 
present. The pamphlet would 
also include a Third College 
student and faculty survey of 
matters such as: .curriculum, 
recruitment and retention, 
strengths and weaknesses of 
Third, ideals of the college, and 
the future of Third . The 
questions would be obtained 
from the Curriculum Committee, 
Academic Advising, the Resident 
Dean's Offi'ce and the Dean's 
Office, 

The seco nd portion of the 
proposal calls for the 
coordination of EOP, AARC, and 
Third 's recruitment programs to 
meet the student and faculry 
needs indicated in their surveys. 

The retention of ThIrd College 
students through coordination, 
consultation and support of 
OASIS, the Academic Honors 
Program, Peer Counseling, 
Summer Bridge. the Black 
Student Union (BSU), the 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan (MEChA), and the 
Asian Paci fic Stud ent Alliance 
(APSA) is also addressed by the 
proposal. 

The rroposal also calls for the 
Counci to publicize and assist 
the "Undergraduate for a Day" 
program. The highly successful 
four year old program recruits "At 
Risk" students (usually 
economically disadvantaged 
minorities) by inviting Third 
College applicants to spend the 
night at the Third College 
apartments with a student and 
go to dasses the following day. 
The program has an over 90 
percent success ratio of 
recruiti ng participating high 
sc hool students, but is nor widely 
known and receives little 
funding. 

The final ponion of the 
proposal calls the curriculum to 
reflect the ideal" of faculty and 
students. The proposal 
emphasizes the need for 
strengthening the Third World

Erik Basil and Erik Nielsen , 
who submitted the proposal , 
were gIven rwo mll1utes to 
explain it to the ounci!. The 
proposal has been added to next 
Monday's Council agenda, 
however BaSIl and NIelsen will 
be unable to attend as they will 
be in Sacramento working on 
behalf of the Ul11Verslty of 
CalifornIa Student Alliance 
(UCSA). 

The proposal has received the 
co nditional approval of Acting 
Third College ProVOSt Gerald 
Stem, however he wants the 
Council to come to him with the 
proposal. If the council comes to 
him and the survey meets the 
needs of students, Stem said the 
Provost's Office would be willing 
to fund it, according to Basil. 

Third's new direction was also 
addressed at the Council 
meeting by Kim Kelso , who 
suggested that a speaker such as 
Angela Davis be asked to speak 
at the quarterly Third College 
Forum this spring. 

Third College Council 
meetings are open to the public 
and concerned students are 
encouraged to attend . The 
meetings are held in the 
conference room of the Dean's 
Office on Mond ays at 6:30 pm,

Part one 

An open letter to the UC Regents 
By JON J. READ 

An Open Letter To The 
Regents of The Untver It)' of 
California, JanualY is , 1987 

There was a bnef moment 
during the mlnt -SUmmll at 
Reykjavic when the pOSSibility of 
a major breakthrough on 
disarmament nickered and was 
glimpscd around the world . I do 
not remember exactly when and 
how it hit me, or how to 
describe lhe sensation Just ler 
me say that I believe it hit you 
too It was neetlng. but for a 
moment we were allowed the 
thrill of behevmg, -My God it's 
actually possible ." 

larls. Even where leaders of a 
household want peace . they 
ofren fall. How reahsnc IS Il then 
to expect more of leadel~ of 
countries antagoOlstlc toward 
each other, espe tally when the 
I sues are so complex and where 
huge mlhtaty Industrial 
bureaucracies stand to bencHt, at 
least In the shorr run , from a 
continUing arms race? 

The University of California 
could do mu h to obVlme what 
amounts to a blackout. Inviting 
one of the leaders as a 
commencement speaker IS :1 
possibihty, but the urgency of the 
situation (see the latest I ue of 
The Defellse Momtor) demands 
that we focus les, on ceremonial 
opportunlt1e~ and more on 
Involvment on a substantive 
level. 

The Group of IX has been 
aided considerdbly by 
Parliamentarians Global Action, 
an international organization of 
over 600 parliamentarians and 

congressmembers from 36 
countrie . I spoke with their 
ecretary-General, icholas 

Dunlop. shortly after Reykjavic 
and he said . "If there had been a 
constructive third party in those 
talks thcn it all might nOt be 
unravelling now " 

My suggestion. which Will of 
course requi re world-WIde 
suppOrt and pressure. is that at a 
minimum, the Group of Six, 
supporteaby the 101 on-
aligned Nations, and assisted by 
Parliamentarians Global Action 
should serve as rcsource and ' 
safety net to the present 

armament talks. 
If this fa il s to yield substantial 

and rapid results then the Group 
of ix , assisted by several 
hundred scientists, negotiators, 
<Ind mtllraty experts from various 
countries but org<lOlzed as a 
tcam , would attempt to mediate 
arms reductions agreeable to 
both parties [Q 

This letter. released by / he ASUC 
in Berkeley, Itas been published tltls 
week th roughout the UC system. Due 
to SfXIce constraints, Ihe second half 
will appear in the Monday issue of lite 
Guardian. 

In the weeks that have 
followed, I do not believe we are 
alone in wondering how to cope 
WIth that moment. Gorng on as 
though nothrng ha happened IS 
Impossible, but who can we talk 
to and what can we say that 
means anything7 What 
commentator has laid hold of 
our predlcament7 

An alternative strategy lhat 
spn ngs to mind is for some third 
party to aid in the negotiating 
process. Granted, there are no 
truly unbIased thIrd parTIes, but I 
was in Mexico City this summer 
when the Group of Six was 
meenng In Ixtapa. The Group of 
ix IS also know for (and as) the 

hve Continent Peace Initiative 
and IS composed, as you are no 
doubt awa it' . of Argentrna. 
Greece . IndIa, MeXICO. Sweden 
and T anzanta 

State of the euphemism 
For centuries It has been 

beheved that universal 
disarmament was a least 
pOSSible, but that travel to the 
moon was an absurd notion . 
Why did the latter prove feasible 
and the former not? 

In Simpler terms. it may be 
that we contflved a winning 
strategy for the one. but not the 
other. 

What then is the naw in our

.... 'as JUSt a few weeks ago that it

their concern \'.'as far deeper 
than making points for

haranguing the twO major

serious and are an important 
resource that should be admmed 
when addressing the problem of 
arms control Unforrunately. their 
concern and efforts are largely 
unrealized in thiS country. The 
only mentIOn I could Hnd of this

its grip since the Iran debacle 
first broke in mid-November. 
Rarely have Americans seen a 
more chipper Gipper. In fact, 
Representative Leon Panetta, D-
Momerrey, described Reagan's 
most recent speech thusly: "It's 
almost as if he landed in Oz and 
everyone else was in Kansas." 

Unfortunately. just as the 
Wizard of Oz was eventually 
exposed as the charlatan he 
most cenainly \'.'as, President 
Reagan too has unWittingly 
revealed himself as a man both 
untrusrwonhy and unqualified to 
hold the highest office in the 
land. Untrusrworthy, because he 
failed to avail the opportunity to 
redeem himself - that is, 
apologize - to the American 
people for condoning (or at least 
sleeping through) the most 
dishonest White House scheme 
since Watergate . Incompetent, 
because of his present inaction 
in dealing with subordinates who 
masterminded the Contragate 
fiasco. 

Instead, Reagan, as in the past. 
chose to substitute euphemisms 
and rhetoric for substance and 
accountabili ry. He again spoke of 

the neccesity to catch up with 
the Russians, to aid the Contras, 
and a Star Wars defense system 
in every driveway. He poke 
again of a drug free society while 
his administration conti nues 
cutti ng funds to the drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation programs 
he once endorsed. He called for 
a recommitment to academics, 
while he further slashed federal 
aid to education. He demanded 
a balanced budget amendment 
and the line item vew to control 
the astonomiocal budget defiCit, 
which he himself has more than 
doubled from $750 billion in 
1981 to over $2.2 trillion in 
1986. In short, the President 
persists in giving Americans a 
placebo in place of the harsh 
medicine needed to restore 
America's vitaliry while he goes 
about hiding under a public 
relations camouflage. 

As the day of reckoning fast 
approaches. the President will 
need to come up with new ideas 
and answers instead of relyi ng on 
the smoke and mirrors approach 
that has worked so well in the past.

Notes from the Underground 
The executive's junta 
W ITH a great amount of inspiration from Theodore Draper's analysis of the Reagan Junta. I beheve it is time to make a spirited 
run at deciphering the implications of the lranamuck-
Contragate-Terrorscam problematic that has besieged 
our nation for the past three months. Let us begin with 
a few solid assumptions that have nOt been frequently 
discussed in the mass media. 

President Reagan had, since the time of his election 
in 1980, appointed an imperial military junta to run the 
foreign policy apparatus of the United States. This junta 
was lead by presidentialliason and former director of 
the National Security Council Vice Adm. John 
Poindexter. and was soldered by a disinformative variety 
of scapegoats: Lt. Col. Roben McFarlane, Lt. Col. Oliver 
North, Lt. Col. Raben Earle, and Lt. Col. Jim Stark. The 
colonels were aided General Richard Secord. and ex-CIA 
director William Casey, who explained in December 
that his agency had put itself in a "suppon mode" to 
Poindexter for the lran-Contras arms deal. Before that , 
the colonels and the CIA had been given license to 
break both domestic and international laws all over the 
,globe in order to aid the Reagan Administration's 
favorite cold war projects. 

The list of these lawless atrocities is endless: from the 
invasion of Grenada. to the bombing of Libya without 

cons ulting Congress; the contrnuous breaking of the 
Boland Amendment by evading a Congre sional band 
on supplying arms to the comras and to Jonas Savimbl 's 
South Africa backed Unita forces terroristic war against 
the Angolan government; the selling of armaments 
through second entities (most Qotably Isreal) to oth~r 
militaty juntas, like those in Guatemala and EI Salvador; 
and the sa nctioning of CIA-NSC covert operations in 
over 50 locations o n the planet earth (see Zimbabwe, 
Chad, Zambia, Honduras. COSta Rica and Algeria just to 
name a few). . 

On January 17, 1986. President Reagan signed a 
secret intelligence "finding" authorizing the sale of 
weapons and spare pans to Iran. This -finding" 
supposedly discovered some "moderau! elements" in 
Iran who were willing to help free American hostages 
being held in Lebanon in exchange for wanime goodies 
(Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger still denies the 

. existence of such elements). The real discovery was, 
however, the willingness of a couple of Saudi Arabian 
bill-changers to help funnel the profits from the Iran ian 
sales to the contras. 

This "finding: authored by Poindexter and the 
colonels, qUickly turned into a presidential directive. 
Part of the content of th e directive - that it would nor 
be made known to Congress - was very much in the 
character of the junta . Another component of the

Matthew J. Cronin 
directive was quite remarkable though . as it stipula ted 
that only four members of the atlonal Security Council 
would be informed of the deal. Those who were left 
dumbfounded when the scandal broke out were: 
Secretary of Defense Weinberger. Secretary of State 
Schultz, Secretary of the Treasuty Baker, and the 
Chairma n of the JOint Chiefs of Staff Wilham j. Crave Jr. 
Those who were told were : CIA Director Casey. Vice 
President Bush , Attorney General Edwin Meese, and 
Presidential Chief of Staff and Reagan Adminstration 
overlord Donald Regan. 

To say that Reagan did not know what he was 
signing is to ignore the fact that intensive discussions 
had taken place in the NSC for six weeks before Reagan 
signed the directive. As Schultz himself said in his 
testimony before Congress on December 8 1986, he was 
in favor of engaging "in a dialogue if they release our 
hostages but that we would not sell them arms." Schultz 
confirmed that he and then National Security Advisor 
McFarlane had been considering the idea of an arrns-
for-hostages swap since June of 1985. Both of them 
evenrually opposed the swap, along with Crave and 
Baker. but did little later to investigate how exactly all 
this new money appeared in a bank account waiting fo r 
a contra mercenary team to pick it up. Neither 
Weinberger, Crave , Schultz nor Baker, told Congress of

theIr suspIcIons. they aIded in the cover-up not onl)' 
because of their loyalty to the Gipper, but because all of 
them support the Idea of laundenng money to the 
contl'as. 

Many political pundits and ideologues, along with 
many members of Congress, have rallied around the 
declaration that the institution of the presiden y must 
be preserved at all costs. They have stated that a strong 
executive branch is necessary 10 the maintenance of a 
democratic system, most espeCially because a freely 
elected president IS the only person in government who 
can truly act in accordance with the will of the country's 
maJority. Although In theol)' thIS Idea may be a 
salvagable one, 10 practice most U .. preSIdents have 
scorned the df'mocratic publi WIll 10 order to pursue 
the more ambillous goals of the chief of a superpower. 

Arthur Schles10ger Jr. , In hiS book The Imperial 

Pre idel1cy dates the "presidenllal breakaway" from 
Congress and the cit izenry after the econd World War. 
He writes. "the po twar preSidents, though Eisenhower 
and Kennedy markedly less than Truman , John on , and 
Nixon, almost came to see the sha ring of power with 
Congress 1Il foreign pOltC)1 as a derogallon of the 
PreslJen 'y " Theodore Draper add to his analysis by 
say1Og, "the Imperial presidency, then, IS one that acts 
autocratically. It does so f·u more in foreIgn than in 
domestic affaIrs. Yet it was not always so. As long as the 
Isolationist tradition was still strong, pre Idents had less 
III emive or opportumry to act alone . Once the so-called 
Truman Doctrine of 1947 seemed to provide a license tei 
IIltervene evel)'\vhere in the world , presidents were far 
less mclined to reo tralll themselves, espeCIally in periods 
of ongressional compliance." I would assen that thIS 
tradition hails back to the Monroe Doctri ne, which 
enabled Impenal preSidents of the 19th century to 

onsistently 10terfere in the affairs of Latin American 
nations 

PlaCIng the Idea of an lIlstitution worth saving' in the 

Constitutional context, I[ would be safe to say that a 
presiden y th at has become lawless, imperial, and 
indifferent to democratic ideals is nOl wonh saving as it 
stands today. For If executive power now enables the 
administration to ignore the mandates of a supp sedly 
free and open SOCIety, and at the same time pursue the 
greed)' aspIrations of an errant superpower, [han the 
in ti(Ution it. elf should be put under the thumb of the 
more publically accountable legIslative branch . The 
Reagan Adminstration. even if it now claims tha t it 
de ires, "full coopera tion" with Congre~s in selting 
foreig n policy, has not ye t galie n what it deserves by 
urinating all over public tru I. Just because Reagan is sti ll 
cast as a popular president by th ose who agree with his 
poliCIes, and merely because he is still Ii ked by those 
citizens who arc unaware of his admini tra tion's canny 
manipulation of truth does not mean tha l he and his 
juma should nor be impeached . For if there is one 
vestige of this system that is worth saving, it is the right 
of the people's representatives to tty. convict . and 
remove from oOke an autocratic Executive branch . [a:J

Local artists promote art for AIDS sake 
By DEBBIE LOWE 

W HEN a San Diego artist recently died of AIDS, Larry Baza 
knew that something needed [0 
be done . For Baza, bmh the 
Associate Director of Sushi 
Gallery and a professional 
actor/ producer, the loss was a 
very personal one . 

"I've been feeling for a very 
long time that I wanted to do 
something about AIDS." Baza 
said, "I am also gay, so the issue 
meant a lot to me. When a local 
artist died, I thought that I had 
to make a statement in some 
way. So I came up with the idea 
of putting together a show." 

When Baza began circulating_ 
his idea to other San DIego 
artists, the response was much 
stronger than he expected. Baza 
was soon overwlielmed with calls 
from artists . People he had never 
heard of before approached him, 
offenng [0 volunteer theIr nme. 

This enthusiasm evolved Into 
Anists for Aids AsSIstance 
(AAA), a major reVlew, vanety 
benefil which will be held at [he 
Lyceum Theatre on February 20 
at 8 pm. The show wIll Include 
local performIng groups from the 
San DIego Repenory Theater, the 

Old Globe, and dance 
perfonnances from Three's 
Company, perfonnance artists 
Eleanor and David Antin, Alan 
Kaprow and Berne among other 
representatives from the artistic 
community. 

Although organizing such a 
large event with so many 
different types of performers 
would normally be an 
intimidating challenge, Baza was 
encouraged by the cooperation 
he received from the generally 
temperamental entourage of 
artists. 

Because all the artists and 
support people are donating 
their time, there will be no debts 
[0 payoff at the end of the 
show. Unlike many fundraisers, 
100 percent of the money raised 
at the benefit will go directly to 
the victims of AIDS. Rather than 
going to medical research, the 
money will go to local patients 
for housing, food, and , other 
necessines for Immediate

In addition to raising money 
for the victims, the orgamzers of 
thIS event hope that their benefit 
will inspire other San Diego 
groups to begin fund raisers for 
AIDS. Ci ting the example of

believe that it IS time for an

raising even!. It is time for [he 
world to realize that somebody 
beSIdes famous e ntertainers have 
to get together to do omethmg 
about serious issues. This is nor 
like icaragua. Ihis is nor like 
Eth iopia. You cannot. sit down 
and write a check and forget 
about it. This (issue) is banging 
on everyone's doorstep in the 
city." 

"I am openly gay and I am 
very impressed because the 

'majority of the performers in the 
show are nor gay," Baza 
commented. "Art is my iife and 
that is where I put my energy. 
My family . the art community, 
might want to tear each other's 
hair OUt at nmes, but here we 
have found a unifying factOT. If 
they can put forth the effort and 
they're not gay people, then it's 
time for everybody else to stan." 

"We see this benefit as a 
catalyst," Best said . "We're givi ng 
an example to oth er groups in 
this town . This should not be a 
one time thing. There are a lot of 
professionals in this town who 
haven't done anything. They can 
essentially raise a lot more 
doUars because they have access 
to a lot more people with 
money." 

Baza emphasized , "AIDS isnOl 
going to stop. The amount of 
victims is not goi ng to stop." 

Unlike many causes that might 
seem distant to most people, 
AIDS is a disease that will have 
important consequences for the 
entire population , not just the 
gay community. The organizers 
of AAA. believe that these 
consequences caU for 
involvement from everyone. 

Although Baza concedes that 
this benefit will probably be the 
largest they will organize, he and 
Best stressed that they have 
plans for many more fundmisers 
and shows in the future. With 
the suppOrt and enthusiasm they 
have received from the artists, 
they are confident that fighting 
against AID can be an ongoi ng 
commitment rather than a one 
time thing.

it "is as difficult to recover from 
relationship dependency (or 
loving too much) as it is to 
recover from alcoh olism. And for 
those sufferi ng from either 
di sease, that recovery can make 
the difference berween life and 
death ." 

In the final chapter of the 
book, Norwood offers ten steps 
to recovery. She stresses, 
however, that me steps are 
simple , bur not easy, and that 
women who follow these steps 
will get well . 

Finding a peer support group 
is one of the steps to recovery 
for several reasons. "As others 
share their stoties, you will be 
able to identify with them and 
their experiences. They will help 
you to remember what you have 
bl ked from your awareness -
both eve nts and feeli ngs."

Coyotes skinned in OT 
Saintignon's three-pointer beats CSUSB 

By GUST AVO SANTOYO, porlS Edllor 

U CSD guard John Samtignon hit a three pomt shot with four 
seconds left in ovemme to lead 
the Tritons over Cal-State San 
Bernardino 100-99 in a wild 
bamburner before 200 boisterous 
fans in the "Coyotes' Den." 

"It Vias just an amazing game," 
said UCSD assistant coach Mark 
Aumann. "We're exhausted, but 
reheved ." 

Sainngnon's shot capped off 
an incredible senes of events at 
the end of regulation and 
overtime. UCSD had kept a 
seven to eight point lead through 
most of the game when CSUSB 
staged a vicious comeback. 

The Coyotes, down 90-87 , 
with one second remaining in 
regulation, had the ball 
underneath their basket. Coyote 
guard Zach Bose , who had gone 
I for 18 shooting from the field , 
took the inbounds pass on the 

.., left baseline and swished a 
"- three-painter at the buzzer, tying 

Triton forward Andy Jedynak might be rejected, but UCSD playoff hopes aren't. the game at 90-90, and sending 
the game into overtime. 

Doing the 'dirty' work 
By LYNNE MCLEVIE 

SANDY Keaton is on a team which doesn't get much recognition and in a 
position which doesn 't get much 
recogniuon. But she doesn't 
mind - that's nor what she 
plays for. Sandy Keaton plays 
basketball on the Triton team for 
the love of the game. 
- She started playi ng, when she 

was m seventh grade but her real 
career began in high school on a 
team that did a lor of losing. 
Entering in at the ground level , 
Keaton learned that basketball 
was played for fun and she 
commues thaI behef even today. 
This 'happy go lucky' atulude 
has worked well for Keaton . She 
says that she plays because she 
"jUSt likes the game ." 

When one thinks of Keaton's 
contribution to the team. most 
people say that defense is her 
primary role as the off-guard . BUI 
upon watching a game, it is 
obvious that her role on the team 
is much more than that. 
Although she may not shoot very 

often, she is a major offensive 
threat. She can get the ball to the 
Tmon frontline players and 
exploit the middle. 

"She doesn't like to be flashy," 
said teammate Beth Copeland , 
"She just likes to do her Job." 
And what a Job she does. 

Her 'Job" consists of getting 
the ball inSIde , playing tough 
defense and being the team's 
"stabilizer." Keaton runs the plays 
and keeps the team organized. 
She also has the unenviable task 
of keeping the other team's best 
offensive players fro!11 sconng. 
Although Keaton IS not the 
team's high scorer, she has 
become a team leader. 

Keaton leads by example . She 
is a mad scrambler on the floor 
going for loose balls and steals. 
"My favorIte aspect of the game 
is being able to go for it m a 
structural realm ," saId Keaton , 
"and being able to run your guts 
out." As Heidi ]ungling, a forward 
on the team explams, 'Sandy 
would give everything for a game." 

Sports Calendar 

The proof of this can be seen 
by the fact that she is playing 
with two injuries this year. One 
mjury carried over from last year 
IS a loose shoulder, the othe r 
feels like a shin splint. 
Nevertheless, she says that It 
really isn't a problem when she 
plays. 

In addition to basketball , 
Keaton works in the Sports 
Information Department and 
takes a full load of classes. As a 
communications major, she will 
graduate this June. When she is 
dune with this, her final season , 
she will continue to play in 
women's leagues as well as bike 
and run In what's left of her 
spare time , when It Isn 't too 
cold , she can be found catching 
the waves on her surfboard. 

"Sandy does all the dirty work ," 
saId UCSD head coach Judy 
Malone . ·She's not flashy, but she's 
willing to do anything ugly - like 
dIve for loose balls. She's a grea t 
competitor." fi:i)

The craziness gOt worsc In

95-94 and 35 seconds left , 
CSUSB Mike BUJnovsky canned a 
three-pOinter making the score 
97-95 in the Coyotes' favor. 

"We are without a 
a doubt, one of the 
top-20 division III 
teams in the nation," 

-10m Marshall 

UCSD's Brian Backens hit a 
Jumper to tie the score a t 97-97, 
but then CSUSB countered when · 
center Elroy Moses scored in the 
key off a rebound, giving CSUSB 
a 99-97 lead, with 14 seconds 
left in ovenime. 

UCSD took the ball out right 
away, and in the confusion did 
not see head coach Tom 
Marshall scream for a timeout. 
Nevenheless, Saintignon brought 
the ball down the court, saw a 
gap at the top of the key. and, 
with four seconds left , hit the 
bottom of the net, making the 
final score 100-99. 

CSUS B tried one last 
desperation shot that was way 
off the mark, netting the victory 
for th e T ri tons. 

Backens led all scorers with 26 
points. Saintignon hit for 22 
points , including the game 
winning three-pointer. Greg 
Kamansky added 23 points for 
the Tritons, 15 of them in the 
first half. 

The win was especially 
important because it came 
against a division III school and 
thus kept the Tri tons' playoff 
hopes very alive . 

"A loss would not have 
eliminated us from any chance at 
the playoffs ," said Aumann , "but 
it would sure have made things 
more difTicult." 

• • • 
San Diego is great if you're 

into the America's Cup, but it's 
not exac tly a choice locale if 
you're trying to make the NCAA 
division III playoffs. Just ask 
UCSD head coach Tom Marshall. 
UCSD, closing in on a 20-win 
season should be a strong 
contender for a Spot in the poSt-
season tourname nt. 

However, beca use of th e 
pecuhar alignment of regions the 
NCAA has set-up, the Tritons are 
111 jeopa rdy of not making the 
playofls at all , and this has 
Marshall concemed. 

"We are, without a doubt, one 
of the tOp-20 division 1Il teams 
In the nallons," said Marshall. 
"but because of political things, 
we can't seem to break thc 
stigma of being a West Coast 
tcam, and most of Ihe people 
who make the decisions on who 
goes whcre do not think hIghly 
of the the basketball out here ." 

The way the playoffs are set 
up are simple enough: the 
country IS split up into eight 
regions , and four teams from 
each region qualify for the 32-
team tOurnament. 

But for an independent in the 
West, like UCSD, things get a 
httle sticky. The West, for some 
reason, mclude::. everything west 
of the MIS issiPPI River. Out of 
the possible playoff SpotS, three 
of them are automatic be rths for 
the champions of the Iowa , 
Minnoesota and SClAC (LA) 
conferences. 

eventeen of the possible 32 
playoff Spots are automatic 
berths, leaving 15 at-large SpOts, 
which theoretically gives UCSD a 
good chance of making the 
tOurnament. But according to 
Marshall, polities a rc reducing 
the Triton chances at post-
season play. 

"There are 15 at-large Spots, 
but regions are very 
autonomous," said Marshall, "and 
they rea lly do not like to go out 
of the region to pick an at-large 
benh." 

This means that UCSD is 
fighting for that one Spot in the 
West with virtually half the 
country. Nevenheless, Marshall 
sees a silvcr lIning amongst the 
tamished toumament selection 
process. 

"There are some good things 
we have done this season that 
should have us considered for 
the playoffs," saId Marshall . "We 
have a c hance at 20 wms and 
we have won some key games 
over the best division 1II tcams 
in the country. 

UCSD has not on ly beaten 
3rd-ranked Clark Uni versity 
(Mass.) and 7th-ra nked Nazare th 
College (New York), but Marshall 
feels the Tritons' win agai nst 
Wheaton College of Illinois 
should also have an effect on 
their playoff selection . 

"That win shows the people in 
Midwest that we can play," said 
Marshall . 

Yet as far as Marshall's 
concerned , winning thei r last 
four games are of the utmost 
importance. which includes twO 
c rucial games with division III 
opponents Menlo and Pomona 
Pitzer, as well as a grudge match 
with diviSIOn USIU , who UCSD 
upset early in the season. 

"At this point. we have to win 
every game," said Marshall , "and 
then hope for the best." fi:i)

Radio 
Days 
by phil macgovern 

Everyone knows who Woody Allen is. Ewn 
the most casual movie-goer has seen at lea$: one of 
his movies. So, I won't go into his style or 
technique. The facts: Woody Allen has written 
and directed a new movie called Radio Days. It 
stars Mia Farrow, Seth Green, Julie Kavner, josh 
Mostel, Michael Tucker and Dianne Wiest; other 
Woody Allen regulars such as Diane Keaton, jeff 
Daniels, and Tony Roberts have bit parts. 

The movie is narrated by Allen, who tells 
assorted stories about "his" jewish family in 
Rockaway, New jersey, during the early forties 
when Radio was "king," He tells how radio 
affected everyone's lives, giving them an outlet (or 
perhaps a beginning) for their various fantasies. 

The main character is a red-haired little boy 
named joe (Seth Green). He is at the precious age 
to which us rookie post-teens sometimes wish we 
could return. joe doesn't have any cares or 
worries - not when there's always the Masked 
Avenger to protect him with his Secret Decoder 
Ring and not with Biff Baxter capturing evil-doers 
everywhere. 

Green is probably the best child actor I have 
ever seen_ He is perfectly cast in the role, and 1 

. could swear that he is going to look like Woody 
Allen in thirty years. But Green is not the only one 
who is perfectly cast in his role. Mother Oulie 
Kavner), and Father ( Michael Tucker) are also 
perfect. Both give off the aura of parents that live 
with what they have and make the most of it. Both 
are very funny and the characters grow on you 
quickly. 

josh Mostel has perhaps the most hilarious role 
as Uncle Abe (the family is very extended). Uncle 
Abe is what everyone remembers their uncles 
being; that makes him wonderful. Uncle Abe has a 
thing for fish . He brings home all sorts from the 
docks, and the family thus becomes the flsh 
experts of all Northern New jersey. Dianne Wiest 
plays Mother's unmacried sister, .Bea, who is 
always in search of her Prince Charming. 

Lastly, but not at all least, is Mia Farrow. She 
has been in five previous Woody Allen movies, 
including the movie that Radio Days is going to get 
compared to the most, Hannah a'l'i her Sisters. She 
plays a character that is not related tC\loe's family, 
a cigarette girl in a' posh Manhattan nightclub. 
She, too, is affected by radio; she would die to be a 
radio star, Through Farrow's character, we get to 
see behind the speaker of the radio, and into the 
lives of the radio stars. 

There are two other things that make this movie 
wonderful , One is that it is a simply beautiful 
movie to watch, The interiors of the New Yark 

ni~ht clubs are exquisite, covered with' gild and

From 
the Hip 

bv marla hellman and eva wong 
Besides the low pay, long hours and widespread 

criticism that comes from being an arts editor on a 
college newspaper, there are also those e\le1lts that 
seem to make it all worthwhile. One such 
highlight . was meeting judd Nelson after the 
screening of the comedy-thriller FTOm the Hip, his 
new movie which opens in San Diego theaters 
tomorrow. 

The screening of From the Hip was at ten in the 
morning in Los Angeles, so we got up bright and 
early (6:00 am, or so) one cold Saturday morning 
in January to road-trip up to DeLaurentiis 
Studios. After a few mishaps such as getting a little 
bit lost in Oceanside (after dropping off a 
"friend" of Nina's, one of our photographers, and 
then running over a Christmas tree by the railroad 
tracks), Deonne finally got us on our way to DEG 
Studios on Wilshire Boulevard_ 

Getting there just in time to have a cup of coffee 
and a donut, we managed to pull ourselves 
together before we were ushered in to the private 
screening room. Along with other college editors 
and photographers, we sa t in the very plush seats 
of DEG's " mini-theater" to view From the Hip_ 

In From the Hip, Nelson makes his debut in an 
"adult" role , He plays Robin "Stormy" 
Weathers, a brash young lawyer just out of law 
school chomping at the bit to try his first case_ Bya 
stroke of luck and some very clever finagling, he 
gets his chance with a "no-win case." Through 
pranks, dramatics and sharp wit, Weathers turns 
the courtroom into his own public theater, where 
his fans help cheer him to victory. 

The publicity from the media coverage lands 
him his second case - to defend the incredibly 
strange, bizarre and spooky Professor Bennoit, 
played convincingly by john Hurt (The Elephant 
Man and 1984). Bennoit hils been accused of a 
prostitute's grisly murder, and the case strains 
Weathers, because he feels that he is not living up 
to the acclaim that he garnered from his first case. 
He also wrestles with the moral dilemma of 
defending certain clients. Luckily, he has support 
from his actress / schoolteacher girl friend , JoAnn, 
played by Elizabeth Perkins ( , . ,AbcNc La.st Night). 
The film is also filled with old-favorites such as 
Allan Arbus (M"'A "'S"'H's Dr. Sydney Freedman), 
Ray Walston (M, Fawrite Martian), and Dan 
Menahan (Park, ',).

Oliver Stone's searing drama of the Vietnam 
War, Plaroon, quite simply demands to be seen. 
Yet it is not a movie for those easily disturbed by 
violence or blunt language; for this is, by Stone's 
own account, about Vietnam the way it really was. 

Or, at least, the way he remembers it_ There 
have been rumblings among factions of Viernam 
veterans that the war really wasn't as horrible as all 
this, that they are sick of films portraying them as 
child-killers and village-burners_ Maybe these 
soldiers didn't perform these atrocities, but 
someone did_ And Platoon, in its own way, sheds 
some light on why these frustrated men did what 
they d id. 

Platoon begins with a quote from Ecclesiastes: 
" Rejoice, 0 young man, in thy youth. II It is about 
as reassuring as the film gets. From here we see the 
war through the eyes of a young recruit, C hris 
Taylor (Charlie Sheen). 

Producer Derek Gibson terms director Stone a 
" visual writer, " and he is certainly accurate on 
that count, Platoon only manages to seem trivial 
when it resorts to using a voice-over to allow 
Chris to explain the horrors Stone has shown so 

- graphically. But the voice-over far from ruins the 
experience, and, in fact, brings us quietly back to 
earth as the film draws to a close, By the end, we 
are at least glad to hear Chris' reassuring, soothing 
voice. 

Platoon is excellent on all other levels. Most 
notably, the acting by the three principals, Sheen, 
Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger (who last werl( 
earned, along with Stone and the film itself, ' 
Golden Globe award for his performance), " 
intense and affecting_ Berenger's Sergt!aAt Barn 
is such a completely crazed and evil man that he 
becomes entirely too human. Dafoe, countering 
Barnes with the more humane Sergeant Elias, is 
the film's tragic center_ They both are father 
figures for Sheen's wide-eyed, regretful Chris. 

Once again with Platoon, screenwriter-director 
Stone shows an abnormal fondness for a certain 
four-letter word, but thankfully is never 
restrained by it the way he was with Scarface and 8

Beasties cance 
The Beastie Boys ' February 8 show ing the UCSD gym, has 

been cancelled. The Boys, which originally formed together as a 
punk band in the early part of the eighties, only did a few 
rapping songs as a joke, But they revamped their style to strictly 
rap, sounding like a cross between AC/ OC and Run-DMC. 
Their album "Licensed to Ill," (originally titled " Don't Be A 
Faggot," but Columbia Records refused to use the name) is 
already number nine on Billboards Top 100, number seven on 
the College Records chart, and on the upswing in both. 

The University Events Office (UEO) feared that the damage 
caused by The Boys in other concert halls would carry over to 
UCSDgym. Suchactsasspraypaintingthelockerrooms,kicking 
bouncers in the heads, and breakingbottlesonstageareafewofthe

Million Ways to Die. Nor is the 
violence as repulsive as we 
might have been led to believe 
with all the pre-opening 
publicity Platoon has received. 

Never is it sickening; o nly 
mind numbing. Stone 
performs well the job of 
getting us to become at once 
accustomed to and tired of the 
all-too-real physical and 
emotional casualties .

Y a screwballs 
bV kenneth calhoun 

If you're like me, then you 
know what a bowling ball is. 
You probably know all about 
baseballs, walruses, banana 
peels, coins and octopuses, 
too. Even if you don't know 
all about these things, be 
assured that you know 
enough. After all, it doesn't 
take much. You've had to do 
things like live on Earth, or 
you could pick it up just by 
watching TV. So there, you 
know enough. Enough to get 
by on Earth in 1987 and, 
more importantly (here's 
sOlnething you probably 
didn't know), to be a part of 
the paintings and scupltures 
of Steve Brooks. 

Brooks, a graduate student 
here at UCSD, knows what 

you know. His art, on exhibit 
as "Screwball Works," 
demonstrates that. Images so 
familiar, things well known 
like baseballs and banana 
peels, pull the viewer in close 
and comfortable. Same with 
the titles. Phrases that refuse 
to die, such as " Play it by 
Ear," "Hard Pill to Swallow" 
or "Tip of the Iceberg," 
caption each piece. They're so 
cliche and so purposely that 
way, one can easily match 
images with the words . But, 
not Brooks' images and that's 
where the twist is, the 
"screwball. " 

What you know, demand-
ing to be recognized, is what 
Brooks' art thrives on. He 
ca lls this recognition "a point

of departure." From there, 
the viewer explores on his 
own. He expects to see things 
but, to his amusement, sees 
others (things Brooks 
substitutes for the expected). 
However, these substitutes 
aren't completely random and 
often they almost connect 
with what's anticipated . 
Strangely, the tension created 
by the struggle to make 
connections tickles like the 
tension between a feather and 
a toe. 

Brooks works with this 
tension. "When I'm painting, 
I'm aware of what's expected 
but I work against it," hesays. 
" That tension of being right 
where it's most thin in being 
connected (with the cliche)

tension, the energy, is held in 
each piece and Brooks 
recognizes it as potential to 
amuse the audience. In his 
work he sets it up as they did 
within the plots of old TV 
comedy, like Abbott and 
Costello. Brooks talked about 
his admiration "Of such 
comedy for it is the aspects of 
that humor that makes his art 
alive. Thanks to those old 
shows, (the pies in the face, 
the slips on the banana peel 
["a convention of slapstick"] 
and the laugh tracks) the 
audience now knows what is 
funny because it's been 
established. Brooks, however, 
plays with the establishment.

say, and I think you already 
know it if you stuck it out this 
far. I really liked this movie; if 
I may be so bold, I have to say 
Radio Days is better than 
Allen's movie, Hannah and Her 
Sisters. The story is funny, 
with one very sad part (I 
cried) included at the perfect 
moment. Go see this movie! ' 
When will I get to go see a 
movie that I don't like?

Hip 
Continued from page I 
incredibly funny scenes as 
well as moments of sheer 
terror, Judd Nelson came in 
for a question and answer 
session. Unlike many of the 
characters he has played, he 
seemed to be a very down,to, 
earth and sincere person. He 
.spoke at length about his 
family, politics, previous film 
-ventures, college, dreams of 
being a basketball star (he's 
5'10", though we thought he 
looked much taller), and of 
course about From the Hip. 
Nelson said he tho. ughly 
enjoyed working on it and 

learned a lot from the many 
veteran actors in the cast. 
From the Hip is also a "loving 
one to Dad, It a lawyer in 
Maine where Nelson grew up. 

When we re~ntered the 
lobby of DeLaurentiis, we saw 
the publicity poster for the 
movie, which was a picture of 
Nelson with a dog bone in his 
mouth; it threw us because it 
didn't seem representative of 
the movie. Don't let the 
poster throw you - From the 
Hip is well worth seeing.
