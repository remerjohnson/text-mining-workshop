Bookstore: Maybe Yes, Maybe No 
by Ron Green 

Thl' UCSD Bookstore is, at ItS 
llP t, a ( onv nlent pia e to buy 
textbook , paper products, and 
\u ndrles At Its worst, it IS a 
( rowded and understocked 
e tabli hment which always 

indicate that no real com-
petition for the bookstore IS 
Ilk'ely to exist Except for such 
a ual endeavors as th Used

need 

Large ly Ignored by th e 
qudent population ex ept 
during th quart rly rush , the 
Bookstore remains virtually the 
on ly store in the area where 
tex tbooks andsuppleln entary 
material can be purchased. 
Be aus of this responsibility, 
the Bookstore i forced to cram 
an entire quarter 's worth of 
reading matC'rial Into an ex-
tr mely small spa e. 

Ac ording to Paul Mare , 
Book store manager, t he 
ove r rowding situation , 
compounded by the lack of 
available warehouse space, 
re ult In frequent shortages of 
books whl h are needed for the 
next quarter' s classes . The 
management is attempting to 
alleviate this problem by in-
creasing communication with 
the Registrar and various 
departments as to the number 
of students requiring books. But 
the orderi ng process sti ll 
remains, largely, a guessing 
gamt', a game which the 
students oftE'n lo:;e. 

Nn competition 
Campus realities seem to 

time retail outlet, leaVing the 
Bookstore in a quite com-
fortable position . 

While technically owned by 
the Regents (they provided the 
initial capital as well as the 
$250,000 urrently outstanding 
loans), the Bookstore i run 
almo t complet Iy independent 
of Rege ntal supervi Ion . 
A lthough a II of the store's 25 fu ll 
tinte personnel are Ca lifornia 
tate mployee, the Regent's 

sale concern IS that the loan 
payments are made on time. 

This unusual bu iness etup 
leaves U SD with more of an 
autonomous profit making 
venture rather than the non-
profit tudent-own d tares 
larger campuses may enjoy. Yet 
while the Bookstore is above all 
operated as a " busine ", and a 
very efficient one at that, all of 
the profits are directed ba k 
Into the store and never 
dIstributed However, all profit 
are used for expanding in-
ventory and clearing out -
tanding debts, in thi respect 

the operatIon IS completely self-
uft IClf'nt. Howev r, ome

not only for stud nts' con-

1" order, Ihen, thaI this ~ind of mis/Q~e nefJer happe1ls again, J 

commissioned a fnimd of mi1le, Clarence Narrow, to wn'te a 
definitive opinion IIP01l ihe matter. His article follows. 

How to Reild A Newsp~per 

It has probably never occurred to you, dear readers, but there is a 
knack to reading a newspaper that makes it somewhat different from 
other printed material. A novel, for example, deals with a certain set 
of characters and defines its story in terms of those characters. There 
are generally subplots, but these are used to further develop either 
the characters or the story. 

A newspaper, on the other hand, has no single story line to follow. 
It possesses a myriad of stories. Last Friday's issue of the Triton Times 
is a good example of this . On the front page are stories about 
Revelle's new resident dean , pre-law seminars, UCSD's methadone 
,clinic, and a couple of political candidates. 

Nowhere is there a sentence stating "this is news ." However, one 
usually gets the idea. After all, this is the most important function of 
a newspaper. What other functions does a newspaper have? Let's 
open an issue of the L.A. Times and see what we find . 

Turning through it, we find a comic page. None of these comics are 
labeled " humor" but, again, we get the idea. Along the way to the 
comics page we've seen what looks suspiciously like comics but since 
they are not on the comic page, we could probably assume they 
belong to the pages and departments in which they are found. Here 
again, though, some mysterious force is at work compelling us to 
think of them as just comics . 

What is thiS mystic presence? No one seems to know. 

Now, let's examine this column . 
First, there is the title, "Low Blows and Cheap Shots ." Then there is 

the logo, a picture of Porky Pig . 
Take your time, class, this is a tc.ugh one . 
YOll first, Billy . No, it is not a news column. Maria? No, it is .Qat a 

political column . Okay, loh nny, what is it? No, it is not a social 
column . 

The answer is it is a humor column . It's not always humorous and 
not always calumnous, but that's the correct answer. 

Class dismissed .

Alternatives~ 

by MilrI! Woebler 
Revelle's new provost, Morris 

Friedkin, has the time to deal with 
student" problems. Dr. Friedkin, 

Milrk Woebler is the Auoc:iate 
City Editor for Revelle Colleae. 

who took over this summer from 
former provost Murray Goodman, 
describes his position as the 
"interface" between faculty and 
students, where the vital ex-
changes of new ideas and 
creative learning takes place. " It 
all starts with the 'student," says' 
Friedkin, "that's what it's all 
about." On the other hand, he 
points out, the student needs to 
understand the need for a basic 
educational process, without 
which new information cannot 

develop ~ 
Friedkin has a "gut feeling" that 

a background in the humanities is 
a necessary adjunct to a suc-
cessful career in any of the 
sciences and participation in the 
world community . Over-
specialization is a danger where it 
tends to cut off flexibility and 
empathy. Referring to the trend 
toward mass education, and 
computer-aided education in 
particular, Friedkin feels that 
computerized learning 
techniques alone are not enough 
to fulfill a persons' basic social 
needs as they are expressed 
through the learning process. 
"Human nature is such that 
students don 't like to go into 
cubicles," says Friedkin,"although 
computer-aided education is 
worth looking into." 

Friedkin says that he's " still 
learning" about his new post, but 
does have definite aims regarding 
maintenance of Revelle's " high 
standards ." Among problems he 
will be attending to, Friedkin 
wants to do whatever possible to 

i nt~ate Revelle with the rest of 
the university. This includes 
bringing department heads and 
members of the Provosts' 
Committee together to insure a 
free flow of ideas and avoid the 
tendency toward parochialism 
which seems to be extant at 
Revelle. Friedkin is interested in 
seeing the earth sciences, with its 
speCial potential for developing a 
persO'nal sense of global 
awareness, expanded . Earth 
sciences encompas~ a broad 
range of disciplines, including 
biological, physical, and other 
technical sciences, as well as 
such fields as nutrition and social 
science. 

Another area of concern to 
Friedkin is over-large classes. This

issue is a ticklish nightmare to 
most college administrators, and 
some actually approve of it, but 
Friedkin stands squarely against 
mass education; rather, he en-
courages plenty of student-
facu Ity dialogue. The in-
timidation some students feel 
when approaching profs for 
advice shouldn't exist, he says . 

The new Provost would like to 
see more "coherence" in the 
natural science sequence on 
Revelle and is also examining the 
popular problem of how to 
provid flexibility within a rigid 
curriculum. The disparity be-
tween the Track One and Track 
Two math and science sequences 
is a matter of concern as well; 
Friedkin wonders, "What is a 
meaningful sequence?" Anyone 
involved in these programs knows 
the tracks aren' t. despite their 

-, 

claimed intention, equivalent . 
Friedkin is also aware of more 

specialized problems, such as the 
plight of the handicapped at 
UCSD, a campus especially 
difficult to get around on . 

Friedkin came to his present 
position from the Biology 
Department, where he served 
since 1969. Prior to that, he was 
Chairman of the Department of 
Pharmacology at Tufts University, 
1958-1969, and on the staff at 
Washington University from 1949 
to 1958. He's the father of three 
girls who've gone through 
college, wh ieh, h~ emphasizes, 
gives him a particular awareness 
of a college kid's problems . In 
addition to his duties as Provost, 
Friedkin hopes to continlJe his 
work in cancer research. But his 
prinCiple area of concern will 
remain the student.

Handicapped: A Forgotten Minority 
The next few months at UCSD will show whether 

the University has fallen into the apathetic tradition 
of its students or whether a definite and sllstained 
effort will be undertaken on behalf of a forgotten 
minority. UCSD has been in existence for almost 
ten years and a need to observe the present level of 
help which is given to the disabled students here is 
necessary. 

While other UC campuses, notably Berkeley and 
Riverside, have committed themselves to a full-
scale program to assist the disabled, there is ab, 
solutely no program or hint of a program here. 
There is no assistance for the blind student to find 
readers or persons to tape the books needed for 
classes . There is no assistance for the deaf student 
to find notetakers. There is no orientation program 
for the blind student , or for that matter, the student 
in a wheelchair, so that they know the routes to 
their classes. 

Try, in your mind, to picture the correct and 
fastest route to USB 2622 which does not require 
going up or down stairs or curbs; or the correct 
route to Matthew's Campus from Revelle; or the 
route to the Chancellor'S off ice from Matthew's-
Third College cafeteria. Or try to reach the Provost 
of Third College; this is impossible unless he comes 
down to get you. 

require easy access by the handicapped. 
The problems exist in the present buildings. Some 

of the problems are the following: door handles on 
the washrooms in 2A are much too high, trapping 
anyone in a wheelchair until someone comes to let 
them out ; many buildings have rises at the door-
ways; there are places where curb-cuts or slopes 
should be provided; there is no guard rail on the 
loading dock of USB to prevent a wheelchair or 
blind student from going off the edge; and there are 
no signs on washrooms which can be used by the 
handicapped which indicate this. Most of these 
problems have been pointed out and corrections 
are being sought. The advance preparation is nearly 
complete , that is, the study aspect of this. The real 
problem lies in the lack of money. 

The student government should be concerned 
with all students. Yet, only the Revelle Council has 
done anything to help . Has any student 
organization even recommended that from all the 
money that student government controls, all the 
money available for entertainment and printing 
flyers , that some of the money be used to help pay 
for signs on the washroom s, for braille indicators on 
the elevators or classroom doors, for ramps or curb-
cuts to enable the disabled student to move around 
on this campus? 

I read through the article in the Triton Times 
about the UC Budget and I did not find one 
mention of money set aside for any of the im-
provements mentioned. Possibly, no one felt that 
this was an important area - either in setting money 
aside or in mention ing the fact that some was set 
aside . EH&S is spending some money on these 
Improvements. but it is doing so at the expense of 
other projects because their budget is about the 
same as three years ago. 

Th ere is no deliberate attempt to avoid 
corrections on this campus. That the opposite is 
true is r flected in the attempts of the Chancellor 
and Mr. Lance Beizer to raise money for the pur-
chase of equipment for the blind . It is also reflected 
in the survey undertaken by Environmental Health 
and Safety to point out the problem areas on 
campus and look for their corrections. It is refle'cted 
in the interest of Mr. Ernest Mort, Dean of Revelle, 
and Dr . Morry Friedkin. Revelle Provost, who is 
disabled also, in organizing the disabled students 
on campus. Friends of the library could possibly begin a r-----------------------project to get a large collection of braille or large I 

print books to help students. The Braille Transcriber I 
Guild will donate their time, but where can the I 
students go for money and equipment? Hopefully, I 
someone who reads this will have some ideas of I 
outside funds and will let us know. I 

._-, 
But a coup le of years have passed since the 

money was collected and spent . And a previous 
survey about the faci lities for th e handicapped did 
not receive enough funds in the budget to make its 
recommended changes . There no longer seems to 
be any strong University comm ittment . to find 
sources of money for these improvements, outside 
of the money the state will give. The result is that 
there is little money to work with at all. 

The facilities on campus are not that prohibitory 
for the disabled student. There are ways to get to 
most of the buildings on campus, with the ex-
ceptions of Matthew's Campus and some of the 
dorms. There are 16 washrooms that have been 
modified for use by wheelchair users. There are 
dorm facilities in Tioga and Tenaya, in Argo and 
Blake There are tar slopes at many, t.~ough not all 
curbs. 
. New bUildings will not present any difficulties 

since they must conform to state regulations that 

In the past, the administration tried to help by 
hiring students to study the problems. Several 
studies have resulted from this practice. Enough 
study has been done on the problems. The ' 
knowledge has been accumulated and what is 
needed now is to form some type of liason for the 
disabled student, to get the disabled students 
organized into a committee that can push for the 
results, but what is needed most is a way to finance 
the results . Until the various sources of money 
available, on campus and off, become aware of the 
need and are willing to help, nothing can be done. 
A complete committment on the part of this 

Unive~sity must be made. •

Academia Should Tolerate Expression 
In responding to Wesley Everest's article (Sept . 

30, Triton Times) which was in response to Daniel 
Orr' s letter to the Los Anleles Times, I am not 
attempting to defend Dr. Orr, but rather am ad-
dreSSing myself to a personal concern over Everest's 
statement : "We students of UCSD are expected to 
take courses from such as Mr. Orr. This is an insult 
that should not be tolerated." 

The freedom of expression enjoyed by every 
member of our faculty and student body must be 
tolerated by members of our academic community; 
for it is only in such an environment that truth can 
be sorted from falsehood and free and open 
examination of human values can take place . 

The personal right to freedom of expression as 
demonstarted in the appointment of a former UCSD 
student, Angela Davis, at UCLA some years ago 
must not just be to lerated but should be recogn ized 
as a fundamental part of our university system . 
Whether someone agrees with an individual's 
politics or not should not be considered important. 

I have been personally insulted by Everest's 
statement because I find in it the same f law as in 
the proposition that books should be burned and 
ideas suppressed in order to achieve " truth" in a 
society .

CoIICfII'tS: April HOl/ue 

Freddie Hubbard/Stanley Turrentine 

Music: 

Admirers of jazz donned their 
latest fashions and filled the San 
Diego Civic Theater to near 
capacity last Saturday night. Tht!y 
came to see two dominant figures 
in jazz. Stanley Turrentine and 
Freddie Hubbard and were given 
a performance of striking con-
trasts. 

Stanley Turrentine opened the 
evening 45 minutes late and 
immediately took control of a 
fidgeting audience. HIS mastery 
of the tenor sax is superb and was 
further enhanced by an excellent 
back-up. Chuck Ratney on bass. 
Sonny Burke on keyboards and 
Spider Webb on drum s. 
Turrentine was only tacitly the 

leader of the group. never leaving 
the others behind. At intervals he 
left the stage to let them 
demonstrate a remarkable 
togetherness . Then back he came 
just like he slipped out -
smoothly. The transitions were so 
fine that they frequently would 
evoke spontaneous applause and 
cat ca lls of approval from the 
audience. 

The contrasts in Turrentine's 
performance were between good 
music and more good music. The 
sounds were at tim s mellow to 
almost melancholy and at others 
hard and driving, but always 
refin d. One element othPr than 
Turrentine's sax which did stand 

out was Burke's finesse on the 
keyboards . The prevailing 
characteristic of this set was 
taste . Even when doing such 
emotional things as cryipg blues, 
the musicians never lost control. 

Which brings us to another 
contrast in the evening . Freddie 
Hubbard and his back-up were 
anything but together. Not to say 
there was no talent in their 
performance. but it was un-
deniably disjointed. The first song 
warmed up the audience to 
Hubbard 's trumpet only to 
change radically to heavy em-
phasiS on the percussionists In the 
next tune and the set continued

The Great La Jolla Chamber Battle 
The great La lolla Chamber battle comm nced last Friday and 

Saturday with the La Jolla Chamber Orchestra. Hot on their h els thi 
weekend will be the La Jolla Sinfonia . Both are groups of professional 
musicians that ' perfQTm in Sherwood Hall In La Jolla Both usually 
perform well-planned toncerts with a number of very good oloists 
But differences w i ll certainly develop, and assimilation of greater 
diversity will probably occur. Rafael Druian (who is on the muSIC 
faculty here at UCSD) led the La Jolla Chamber Orchestra and piano 
soloist Rudolph Firkusny in a program of Corel Ii . Mozart, Copland, 
and Haydn 

Archangelo Corelli (1653-1713) was famous as both a composer 
and performer on the violin . The orchestra played one of the won-
derful twelve concerti grossi of Op. o. Extensively using the Idea of a 
small concerti no, consisting of two solo violins and a cello, playing 
against a larger body of strings and continuo. the ripleno. Corelli 
introduced techniques of using sequences and treating several solo 
instruments that were to be used by the later Ital ians and German 
masters well until the end of the Baroque Era. Corelli sometimes used 
the concertina to elaborate upon. and more often to imitate the 
melody presented In the ripleno. also providing differ nces of timber 
and dynamics. including many echo effects. 

Mr. Druian led the orchestra in a tastefu! p rformance that in-
cluded some nice solo work . P rhaps som of the ontrasts men-
tioned above could have been made clear r by the fairly

Musical Notes 
PUSSYCATS· H;any Nilsson_ RCA Records 

Harry Nilsson's latest LP is going to be a disap-
pointment to his fans, and I lay the major part of 
the blame on the co-star of the record cover, 
Producer JohlT lennon. What seems to have 
happ ned (as we glean from the Ijner notes) is that 
Harry and John formed a deep friendship . And from 
that friendship, eventually came the partnership 
which produced this album . 

I thin" the mistake was naming the album 
Pussycats . It would have been far more r alistic to 
call it The Plastic Nilsson Band. The two opening 
cuts for example. were arranged by John and' sound 
so much like him that one wonders what Harry 
Nilsson 's voice is doing in them . I don 't necessarily 
dislike Lennon's work, but I picked up this album to 
hear the old Schmillson at work . 

rhe album isn't a total disaster . It's a mixed bag 
of nE:'W and old tunes, and some of Harry's 
arrangement work is evidenced in tunes he wrote. 
HIS power to find the most chilling choice of words 

a IS eVidenced 10 songs like "Don't rorg t M e" 
("When we'r old r / full of an er") . 

In ess nce, the album has its ups and down 
which correspond startlngly to the amount Nt! son 
and Lennon r sp tively have to do with ea h cut , 
and If you Ignor rtain tune, the oth r make up 
for It and th album manages to slavage Itself 

Moral . Best of friends don't necessarily "lake th 
best of albums. I think Nilsson even tou hes on the 
Pl'oblem precisely in lyriCS to "All My life": " And 
I've had my sh~re of IIOOd times/I've been moving 

Larry Decke/ 

around/living uptown/ Laughing my ass off/ Almost 
every night/ But I' m so sore from laughing/ I haven't 
got the wi II to fi ght."

In the 18 album history of Zappa and his amoeba-
like grouP. The Mothers [of Invention]. he has 
passed through phase after phase of musical ex-
perimentation . In late 1971, with the departure of 
Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (the Phlorescent 
Leech and Eddie). Zappa began to experiment with 
big band rock. 

Frankly. ragai n. no pun) Zappa fans have been 
moderately disappointed in the efforts which h

Winners Announced 
by P.au' W.alner 

Frisbee enthusiasts congregated last Saturday on the Muir field 
to compete and to put on a display of their talents . Several 
hundred persons swarmed over the field throughout the af-
ternoon , guiding their frisbees through the various events and 
games. 

Once the field had been cleared and the scores totaled, four 
persons had been selected as the champions from the different 
colleges, and one of the college champions was declared to be 
the overall UCSD champion . Rick Shaw was the Revelle champ, 
Jon Alesso carried the honors for Muir, Ray Arkin was victorious 
in the Third College bracket, and Steve Van Horn was high point 
man for Fourth College. Later, by virtue of a tie-breaker, Van 
Horn was declared tile overall UCSD champion . The cham-
pionship was decided solely upon the total amount of points 
accumulated throughout the six events . 

The afternoon was not entirely reserved for the contest. Tom 
Boda, currently ranked third in world Frisbee competition, made 
a special guest appearance. Soda gave a small talk on his 
background and then proceeded to give a demonstration of his 
talents. It was an afternoon of fun for all and, even a dog got in 
on the action .

Women's Center 
Continued from Pqe 1 

Muir and SSOO from Revelle, are 
left over from last year and 
Women's Center will operate on 
them until a new proposal is 
presented to the Student 
cooperative. 

One of the major difficulties 
confronting Women's Center is 
a lack of involvement. Mills says 
the center "is having a problem 
getting people to participate in 
and lead projects ." The center 
needs people to instigate ac-
t ivities as well as join in . To 
open communication channels, 
bulletin boards are located in 
t he Women's Center on which 
activities are listed and sign-up 
sheets are available. 

The Women's Center is also 
building its own library . 
Everyone is encouraged to come 
in and browse. Each Wednesday,

because although there was merit 
in the performance, the overall 
impression was dull . 

rile conclUSion ot the concert 
appeared to be a vague attempt 
to reunite the e\lening . Hubbard
