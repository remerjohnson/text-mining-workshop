Nighttime Parking 
Proposal Passes 

By YURI WON 
Contributing Writer 

The Parking Advisory Com-
mittee has passed a proposal to 
expand parking enforcement 
hours to II p.m., which will bring 
about the need for nighttime 
parking permits. The propo al 
will go into effect July I. 

Whether this measure will pro-
d uce an increase in the cost of 
parking permits is, as yet, un-

~ lown, according to Cleo Philips 
â€¢ J m UCS D parking services. 

lillips maintained that those 
dent and faculty who already 

have permits will not be signifi-
cantly affected, a their permits 
will still be valid through the 
extended hours. 

Furthermore, it has not yet 
been determined which parking 
lots will enforce this new measure, 
or how. 

Campus Pol ice Chief John 
Anderson speculated that there 
may be machines to dispense 

. parking permits for the evening 
"like the ones in downtown [San 
Diego]," and that the Informa-
tion Booth on the Gilman entrance 
may ell evening parking permits 
for approximately one dollar. 

He added that this measure has 
been on the Parking Advisory 
Committee's "back burner for 
many years," and is only material-
izing now as the result of a direct 
order from Steven Relyea, vice 
chancellor of busine s affairs. 
Relyea could not be reached for 
comment. 

The main reason for this mea-
sure , according to Anderson, is to 
keep the "[parking] system bal-
anced ... to keep from having just 
a few people pay to maintain the 
parking lots." He added that 
UCS D is the "only campus in the 
UC system not charging for park-
ing permits at night." 

A.S. President Maynard Dim-
mesdale called the balanced park-
ing argument U a cover up to sway 
popular opinion'" into thinking it 
is legitimate to charge everyone 
for a permit. 

According to Dimmesdale, thi 
measure is being enacted mainly 
to generate revenues. He pointed 
out that the Student Services 
Building that is being built will 
have a parking structure that will 
not be funded by the state, as the 
state only funds academic build-
ings, "and surely [UC administra-
tors] need to generate revenues 
for this parking structure." 

Dimmesdale added that every 
programming organization is 
against this mea ure because it 
"would mean a tremendous set-
back as far as programming for 
the community, because who 
would want to come into UCSD 
and have to pay for a one night 
permit or for a one night use?" 

In addition, Dimme dale ques-
tions the feasibility of charging 
for nighttime permits. 

"There are too many complica-
tions , and once the community 
gets a flavor of that, they wouldn't 
want to attend events on cam-
pus, n he said. 

In an effort to obtain a greater 
under tanding of student needs, 
Vice Chancellor Joe Watson, 
along with several members of the 
A.S. Council, toured the campus 
offering free cupcakes to tudents 
willing to express their thoughts 
about UCSD on Monday between 
noon and 2 p.m. 

According to Watson, the aim 
of the event was to hear random 
perspective a nd seek out tudent 
opinion. 

Some other issues raised includ-
ed the increa e in registration 
fees, improvement of campus 
recreation facilitie and a lack of 
pecial events and overa ll spirit. 

everal commuter suggested 
bringing back noon-time concert 
or holding T.G.' lightly earlier. 
Many on-campu residents com-
plained that there are not enough 
evening activities on weekends.

The A.S. Council has unanim-
ously approved a re olution by 
Bard-Alan Finlan "ind icating 
[that it is] adamantly oppo ed to 
nighttime parking permits," 
Dimmesdale aid. The resolution 
will be forwarded "with a two or

to the Parking Advi ory Com-
mittee. Mordeci Potash, A . . vice 

president external, who helped 
organize the event with A.S . Spe-
cial Projects Director Sunil Ba-

lor Tommy Tucker. said that 
students expressed opinions about 
i !lues ranging from the lack of 
social acti itie to flaws in specific

The most commo n topic 
brought up by the student inter-
viewed was the lack of parking on 
campus. Pota h said that those 
interviewed were a lmo t unanim-

However, the Dean' officei giv-

Vietnam DJ Teaches Radio and Film 
Announcing at V CLA Extension 

LO A GELES - A disc jockey on the original 
"Good Morning Vietnam" radio show in Saigon, 
Vietnam is teaching radio and film announcing skills 
for a UCLA Extension course this quarter. 

Don Burns, a colleague of the disc jockey featured 
in the movie "Good Morning Vietnam," is teaching 
uccessful voice-over techniques, and offering class 

and studio performance experience. 
According to Burns the disc jockeys in Saigon had 

an ongoing competition to see who could hold the 
"good" the longest in the phrase "Good Morning 
Vietnam!" In tbe movie of the same name, Burns' col-
league was depicted as a rebel against censorship. but 
according to Burns, thi is inaccurate. 

"It couldn't have happened . Disc jockeys were not 
allowed to make derogatory comments about the war. 
Everything had to be approved before it was aired," 
Burns said . 

Burns said that he knows "lots of veterans who are 
glad they went to Vietnam." He explained that many 
people learned much from their army experience. For 
example, he gained radio and television broadcasting 
skills that led to a professional career. 

In his voice-over class, Burns teaches students from 
the experience he has gained through various jobs in 
the media.

AS V CSB Sponsors Bm to Recognize 
Contributions of Women and Minorities 

SA TA BARBARA - A bill urging professors to 
"alter their classes to more adequately reflect and rec-
ognize the many contributions of women and people 
of color" was discussed at a Feb. I Associated Stu-
dents Legislative Council meeting. 

Explaining the motivation for the creation of the 
bill, Off-Campus Representative Jill Frandsen sai~ 
students often have no recourse when they see their 
courses unfairly representing women and minorities. 

"Hopefully, professors will be more open to [a 
racially and sexually balanced viewpoint], and they'J 
think about what they're saying when they lecture," 
said Frandsen, who seconded the legislation.

Appointment of New University 
Editor in Chief Spawns Conflict 

IRVI E After approving Tom tarne a editor 
in chief of the New University by a 3-1 vote last week, 
the Media Board revoked its decision only to have the 
vote recast 2-2. 

The board recast its vote when ASUCI President 
David Hurwitz rai ed que tions about the balloting 
procedure. 

In the econd ballot, ASUCI representative Mar-
celia Missirian, who had initially voted for Starnes, 
changed her decision, tying the vote. 

ASUCI appointed Missirian to the Media Board 
after she was forced to resign her post as editor in 
chief of the New University last quarter. 

Board Chair Darryl Low said, "My big question is 
why Marcella changed her vote. The question here is 
Marcella's credi bility as an ASUCI representative 
becau e of her ties with the paper. Is she voting her 
conscience or [is he] merely Hurwitz's puppet?" 

"I told her to change her vote," Hurwitz said. 
According to Low, Hurwitz said, "If she doesn't 

vote the way I want her to 111 just take her off the 
board and appoint myself." 

Hurwitz said he voted against Starnes because "the ' 
Media Board has the power to do that ." The Media 
Board has been "passive' in dealing with the news-
paper, he added. 

"The New U has gotten away with a lot of things it 
shouldn't have," Hurwitz said. 

Hurwitz is referring to a recent threatening of an 
alternative newspaper, Â£os/- West Ties, by the ASUCI 
due to a controversial racial ad that offended many 
students. The A.S. is threatening to cut the funds of 
the paper. 

"A.S. thinks it's not timely. Timeliness is not the 
issue." Starnes added that students should be aware of 
ASUCI's threats to change editorial content. 

" Hurwitz is trying to control media on campus," 
Starnes stated.

Davis Radio Station Receives Bomb 
Threat From V nidentified Woman 

DA VIS - An unidentified caller phoned in a 
bomb threat on UCD's campus late Friday morning, 
Jan . 27, according to campus police. 

Officer Bill Davisson of the UC Davis Police 
Department said that an unknown female caller 
phoned KDVS radio station at approximately 10:55 
Friday morning, claiming there was a bomb in the 
station. 

According to Henry Habra, the disc jockey who 
received the phone call, the woman said a bomb was 

by Berke Breathed 
r-:::::=:::::=-----, 

cheduled to go off in five minute, and that the ta-
tion should be evacuated. 

Ha bra said he cleared out those in the tat ion, shut 
the outer doors to the radio station and called 911 . 

Campus police responded immediately to the call, 
but found no evidence of a bomb. Those at KDVS, 
the Women's Resources and Resea rch Center and 
U niver ity Haircutters were asked to evacuate. 

Davisson said the caller's location and motives were 
unknown. 

This is the second bomb threat made this academic 
year. In December, an unidentified caller claimed that 
a bomb was et to explode in Wellman Hall . 

Pretrial Preceedings Begin for 
UCSB Student for Riot Charges 

SANTA BARBARA - Pretrial proceedings will 
begin Wednesday Feb. I for UCSB freshperson Tom 
Kessler, who faces misdemeanor charges for failing to 
disperse and assaulting a police officer last May dur-
ing the Memorial Day weekend riot in Isla Vista . 

Twenty-three arrests were made during the riot, the 
most severe confrontation between police and local 
students since April 1986, when a riot erupted during 
the weekend of the annual UCSB rugby tournament. 

Although most of the 23 arrests made during the 
riot have been resolved, Kessler's case, scheduled for a 
jury trial on Feb. 22, has taken more than eight 
months to reach the courtroom. 

Ken Moore a cameraman for local station KEYT 
whose footage' of the riot was used as evidence leading 
to disciplinary action against three of the more than 
30 police officers involved in quelling the riot, spe-
culated that the case has taken a long time to reach 
trial because Kessler "didn't plead guilty. Most of the 
other guys were let off easy by pleading guilty." 

He also noted that Kessler's additional charge of 
assaulting an officer may have contributed to the 
delay, as many of the other defendants on who~e 
behalf Moore has testified were charged only With 
failure to disperse from the riot scene.

VCLA Law School Graduate 
Charged With Forging Transcripts 

LOS ANGELES - An arraignment was post-
poned Fridav Jan. 20, for a law school graduate 
accused of forging his academic transc ripts and misre-
porting his grades' on a resume. . . 

The case continues Feb. 17, when Michael LoUIS 
Dmowski, 28, will plea in Los Angeles County 
Municipal Court to charges of altering a certified 
copy of an official record, forging seals, and grand 
theft. 

Dmowski's private lawyer asked a court commis-
sioner for the delay, said Deputy City Attorney Teddy 
Eden. 

Charges were brought to coun after his former 
employer, the prestigious law firm Gibson, Dunn, & 
Crutcher, discovered that Dmowski may have lied 
about his grades to recruiters. 

The discovery came months after Dmowski was 
hired and paid $5,000, money he is now accused of 
stealing. 

A police investigation alleges that Dmowski raised 
his cumulative grade point average from a C to an A 
on a transcript faked with a computer. 

"He was using that to gain money and gain 
employment, both in bad faith," Sgt. Phil Baguiao 
said. 

Dmowski misreported his grades first in a resume 
when he was hired as an attorney in December 1987, 
and then with the transcript just before he was sche-
duled to take the state Bar exam in July 1988, police 
said. 

After he was fired and a warrant was issued for his 
arrest, Dmowski turned himself in Dec. I .

F ear and Loathing 
I Letters I ~~J? 

I T WA JUST before noon when I walked Into Ricci's down on J treet In Sacramento The lunch crowd was not in yet. but a bunch 
of the boys were whooping it up down at the dark end of the bar. 

where they appeared to have a woman cornered In a big leather booth . 
It would ha\e pa ed for a yuppie lunch club anywhere else in the 

Â·valley. but Sacramento IS a political town, and I could see at a glance 
that Ricci'~ was a full-on political bar. Most of the gents mauling that 
woman down there in the booth were wearing neckties, but they had a 
vaguely seedy look a bout them, as if they had lept in their suits on a 
musty couch in some lobbyist's condo with a condom machine in the 
lobby and rubber palm trees in the elevators .... They were unemployed 
lawyers, pimps and stockbrokers: Politicians in a word ... 

I tried to Ignore them, but the shrieks and cries of the woman they 
were passing around like a cheerleader made me jittery. 

I watched for a while, then I stood up and eased down the bar to have 
a better look. The bartender eyed me, but said nothing .... None of the 
wild boys noticed me at first , but when I passed closer to the booth on 
my way to the men's room the girl suddenly quit everything else she was 
doing and locked her eyes on me. 

lt was dark back there, or at least dim, but in the green glow of the 
"EXIT" light she seemed to smile like she recognized me, and was 
about to cry out my name. . 

At first glance, she was a stunningly beautiful woman - red hair and 
lang legs in a tight-fitting business suit that looked almost prim, except 
that the front of her linen skirt was slit straight up to her groin. 

Hands were grasping and groping at her; and suddenly, she kicked 
off her high-heeled Capezios and jumped up on the red leather seat, 
shrieking and kicking at her tormentors. She looked like a very 
expensive lady lawyer gone wild for some reason in a sleazy downtown 
lunch joint . I T WAS ALL in good fun; they were all laughing - but there was a strange high edge on the laughter that made me uneasy ... or 

maybe it's just me, I thought. I had just averaged 88.26 miles an 
hour between the Bay Bridge and the Sacramento River in a custom-
built 1969 mandarin red V-8 427 Chevy convertible with a Turbo-
Latham supercharger, and it had left me a little tense. My forearms 
were still vi brating crazily from the rolling vise grip I'd been keeping on 
the wheel. My fingers were so numb that 1 had to flex my whole hand a 
few times before I could lift the margarita glass to my lips 

" Bad business." I said to the bartender. "What'S happening down 
there? A gang rape?" 

He flinched , then he smiled professionally and said , "Naw, that'sjust 
a bunch of the local hustlers havin'a birthday party. Sorry, I'll tell 'em 
to hold it down." 

"Nonsense," I said. "There's all kinds of rape going on these days. It's 
normal. We'd be craz)' to complain about it. "Then I seized him firmly 
by both shoulders. "But let me ask you something," I said. "Do you 
remember Kitty Genovese?" 

"Not reall)." he said. "Did she work hereT' 
I stared at him for a moment. "They sta bbed her 47 times," I said. "It 

was in a public place, like thIS, and many people watched her being 
killed by a gang of street thugs .... But nobody tried to help her. They 
just watched. They said they didn't want to interfere in her personal 
life .... Some of them said she looked like she was havinga good time." 

He shook his head sadly. W Jesus!"he said. "I'm really sorry. "Then he 
nodded at my glass. "Are you ready for another one?" 

"Sure," I said. "This violence is making me sick." 
Just then we heard a burst of wild laughter and breaking glass from 

inside the ladies room. The red leather booth was empty. 
"You crazy bitch!" the bartender screamed as he ran back and 

kicked the door open .. .. Seconds later he emerged, dragging the 
red-headed woman by one arm. "You slut'" he was yelling. "You're 
fi nished in this place. Get out, and stay out!"

Fire Fighters 
Rude 

'Editor: 
On Feb. 5, at 2:45 a .m. there 

was a false fire alarm in Building 
One in the Warren apartments. I 
believe that the San Diego Fire 
Department responded with out-
rageous behavior. 

The fire captain wanted the 
students to be good citizens. So 
the firefighters rounded us up 
after we had been outside for half 
an hour in 50-degree weather, and 
lectured for five minutes . We were 
sorry that they had to come to 
investigate a false alarm, but that 
is no excuse for making sleepy 
students stay outside for longer 
than necessary. 

The most irritating part of the 
whole incident is the fact that the 
fire department told us that they 
would punish us every time there 
was a false alarm, by keeping us 
out longer and longer. Also, the 
captain accused our building's 
students of pulling alarms in other

In the future a simple angry

Answers Exist 
Editor: 

In response to Joseph McKin-
ley's letter (Guardian, Feb. 6), I 
would like to share a few thoughts 
that I jotted down. 

When I read the letter, it was 
obvious that this person had 
absolutely no idea of the problem 
of parking on campus. To find 
actually who this person was, I 
looked him up in the student 
directory and a few things st ruck 
me: I) he lives at Warren apart-
ments on campus, 2) he is a 
fres hman, and 3) he is a Pre-
Ames major. 

Not to knock the writing abili-
ties of Pre-Ames majors, but the 
logic of Mr. McKinley'S essay is 
baffling. To make a connection 
between the high price of parking 

At Home ... 

permits and the benefits of walk-
ing to class (both physica lly and 
mentally) is asinine. Obviously, 
Mr. McKinley hasn't had the 
opportunity of waking up hours 
before class just to find a parking 
space that is nearly as far as the 
commute to school. He is a 
freshman who ' ITves on cam-
pus !lnd therefore has no right 
to trivialize the sheer hell of the 
parking problem; after all , he 
only has to walk to his classes a 
few minutes away. 

Furthermore, to suggest that 
students be glad that the permits 
are high priced is beyond com-
prehension. Yes, it is true that the 
law of demand will eliminate those 
who refuse to pay the high price 
of permits, but there will always 
be those whu will , and at UCSD 
the "those who will " crowd 
numbers over 10,000. 

To be "glad" to pay $144 for 
abysmal parking and inadequate 
dayt ime security is a phrase I 
thought I would never hear uttered 
by another UCSD student. I'm 
sure in Mr. Mc Kinley's sopho-
more year (if he moves off cam-
pus), he will come to appreciate 
the problem we have. True, walk-
ing does have its virtues, but to 
waste two full hours to and from 
school each day when one could 
be studying is no solution.

But there are some: I) riding 
your bicycle to school lessens the 
commute and is good for you 
(both physically and mentally, 
Joe), and there is no price for 
permits, 2) the cost of a permit for 
a scooter or motorcycle is only 
$60; pretty cheap if you have one 
of these, and 3) the school offers 
free bus passes which are availa-
ble at the parking office. The best 
alternative is parking your car atÂ·

The next time you feel the urge

make sure you have some know-

about, or at least some sort of

Suddenly she reached over and 

snatched the traffic ticket off my 
lap. " Don't worry about this

will take care of it," and she 
stuffed it into het briefcase. 

"Wonderful," I said . " He must 
be a nice guy." 

" He is," she chirped. wHe's a 
very powerful man in the Capitol." 

I glanced across at her. We 
were still rumbling along J Street 
in first gear, coughing up fuel mist 
and occasionally backfiring long 
blasts of flame out ofthe tail pipe. 

"I like this car," she said, as we 
screeched onto the freeway and 

the supercharger kicked in. 
"Yeah, "she said dreamily. "This

slid across the seat and grasped 
my leg. Then she sat up higher, 
and her hair blew slraight back in

under a big green sign that said

AttaLlah Shabazz was a child when she witnessed 
the assasination of her father Malcolm X. 

As the eldest of Malcolm X's six daughters, she was the one 
who was most affected by the anguish that followed, and she is 

the one who now confronts and tries to correct the world's

Attallah Shabazz has dedicated herself to "intra-cultural and

which personal hardship can be "transformed into

Sports-Related Injuries: Going Under the Knife 
By DAVID POTICHA 
lajf Wriler 

Editor:S note: This is the second 
part of this article, the first of 
which was run in the Feh. J issue 
of the Guardian. 

Q: What surgerie have you had? 

Fouts - I hale been real for-
tunate to avoid major surgeries. I 
have only had some "scope ." 
(Arth roscopic surgery i a micro-

surgery where the surgeon enters 
the joint through a small inci ion. 
The surgeon u es a probe that is 
remarkably ver 'atile, and can 
stitch. cut . push. and pull \\ ha-
tever is injured in the joint in 
question .) So far . I have not deve-
loped arthriti in my knees from 
the surgerie . 

Winslow - On Oct. 2 1. 19 4 I 
had major surgery to repair the 
medial collateral and posterior 
cruciate ligaments in my knee. 
Since that time I have only had 
two copes for remova l of scar

tissue. I already have art hritis in 
my knee. 

Siljander - None. It was my 
choice to refuse urgery ... This 
[shoulder separation] was a mid-
dle grade separa tion, between first 
and third degree, and I decided 
not to ha ve the urgery done. It 
could've gone either way, so I 
decided I could live with the 
problem. 

Gerlach This wa my only 
surger . I had no choice, I saw the 
doctor and the next day 1 was in 
surgery. I had no time to think 
about it. 

Meier - I had arthroscopic 
surgery for for a torn miniscus in 
my knee, and that was the only 
urgery 1 had . 

Q: Do most players end up 
injured and needi ng surgery? 

Fouts - You can't avoid inju-
ries ... the biggest factoT i bad 
luck.

Winslow - Quite a few players 
get injured , and a t least 80 percent 
of the players in the FL have 
surgery at one time or another in 
their careers. 

Siljander - I don't know 
anyone at this school who has had 
career-ending injuries. There have 
been a lot of injuries at UCSD, 

but none that even kept players 
out for the season, at least no one 
I know. I do know some people 
who have had knee surgeries, 
though.

Reed Takes A Walk 
On The 

bYdOnOvanp. roCh:~e:"~~~liillliiiiil~~ 
assistant hiatus edito~' __ ., 

Perhaps best known for his overtly sexual "Walk On The Wild Side," Lou 
,~~~~~~!~'~~:~~ to confronting contemporary issues head on. While others 
iii steering clear of the controversial, Reed succeeds by immers-~~i:l~ij~lf in it. 

ake his new album New York for instance. A concept album in every sense 
of the word, New York deals with the rotting condition of the Big Apple - as 
seen, of course, through Lou Reed's perceptive eyes. 

In "Dirty Blvd," when Reed sings, "No one here dreams of being a doctor or a 
lawyer or anything/They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard," you believe 
him. His lyrics jump out at you from the perspective of actually walking with 
Reed through a city swelling with poverty, homelessness, disease , racial viaÂ· 
lence and drugs. 

"Busload of Faith," one of three live tracks on the album, gives Reed the 
oppbrt).mity to reveal his most pessimistic side. He sings, "You can't depend on 
no miracle/You can't depend on tl;te..~i!l'{!l4.s:an't depend on a wise man/You 
can't find them because they're not'thij;:e: ~:':":' 

In a' more humorous vein.Reed~eals.~th onea5pe-ct of parenting - why to 
become one. :~~~:~::~;;::/ .:, .. ::,:." ;.: .' .. 

The j~zzy "Beginning of a G~ MV4!l:!hsrÂ¢' has Reed planning an unusual 
adventure: "I'd breed a little:libelal~rmY i" th~WQOds/Just like these redneck 
lunatics/ I see at the local bar:llNitti Â·Â·t~eir trine' 0f mutant inbred piglets with 
cloven hooves." . '.' . '-".::' 

But such humor is relatively rare on: Nau Y oT~ Re~d is careful not to injure 
his material with the wrong.~oacb.-::. : ..... ::.::::. '. ::::" 

In "Endless Cycle," Re~i:t;Â·r6I16ws .. ~ Â·.path ofÂ· an infinitely more serious 
parenting problem - child abuse. But his approach this. time is more compas-
sionate: "The man if he marries wiU batter his child/and have endless ex-
ctJses.ffhe woman sadly will do much the same/ thinking that it's right and it's 
proper." 

But Reed's impassioned account of human decadence would not be com-
plete without his own rebuttal to politicians and their politics. 

While "Good Evening Mr. Waldheim" attacks Jesse Jackson's "Common 
speech made last summer at the Democratic National Convention, 
;\~~~~~~No Time" (another powerful live track) finds little reason for the 
~ surrounding government appointments. 

much of the success New York can look forward to will undoubtedly be 
to the simplicity of the arrangements. "I was after minimalism with all 

high-tech advantages - not cleanliness but controlled leakage," Reed says. 
, Reed was able to capture this high-tech minimalism with the help of co-
. and drummer Fred Maher, Rob Wasserman on upright sixÂ·string 

arid Mike Rathke on second guitar. 
New York is about the city after which it is named -from Christopher 

, to Tompkins Square and Howard Beach; from Central Park to the 
of Bigotry (as Reed calls it) - it is Reed's intention for us to see the 

similarities in our own communities. ,1m~~Â£~t ~:1~~' 
He may not offer any solutions to our perilous condition, but he ~ 

to take a look. He shows us a slice of America that many Anlerica~lig:~J:jr:!~~m

"I'm writing stuff you have to listen to," Reed says. "That's not my cdi~~~i..

tStupidity In Government' 
Inspection of die new fast paced UCSD theatre production, 

The yOllernment lnspector, is required. It is a sly and satiric comedy 
lambasting corruption and stupIdity in government. Nikoli Go-
gol's comic masterpiece will be presented in the Weiss Studio, 
located In the Mandell Weiss Theatre. The production wIll run 
Feb. 8-12 and 15-18. 

The GOliernmL'Tl[ Inspector is considered by many to be one of the 
greatest Russian comedIes of the 1830's. The play satirizes the 
corrupt city officials of a small town. The officials panic when 
they hear of the arrival of a government inspector intent on 
examining their unscrupulous affairs. 
. Mistaking a stranger for the inspector, the townspeople clums-
Ily try to bribe him. The stranger is no fool and proceeds to take 
them for all they' re worth! 

Tickets for Th~ Government Inspector are available at the UCSD 
Theatre Ticket Office, TicketMaster, the UCSD box office and 
ArtsTix. Tickets are $8 for general admission, $5 for students and 
$6 for UCSD faculty, staff and senior citizens on weeknights. Call

International Talent 
Celebrates New 

School of Architecture I 

by jean suzuki 
hiatus writer 

The Mandeville Gallery is now 
featuring an exhibit of the drawi ngs 
and models of four internationally 
renowned architects in celebration 
of the founding of a School of 
Architecture at UCSD. 

Titled "Architecture/Shaping 
the Future," the exhibit showcases 
the works of Ricardo Legorreta of 
Mexico, Fumihiko Maki of japan, 
Richard Meier of the United 
State, and Richard Rogers of 
England. 

A symposium was held in con-
junction with this exhibit at Man-
deville Auditorium on Feb. 4 . It 
was a day-long event where ea h 
architect held an illustrated lec-
ture of his past works and future 
plans. There was also a panel dis-
cussion that addressed questions 
on the topic of education in 
architecture. 

The symposium was held to 
bring together members of the 
community and UCSD with a 
group of distinguished architects 
to promote awareness about the 
role of the new School of 
Architecture. 

Richard Meier's 

Axonometric in 

Context, 1986, 

located in The 

Hague, 

Netherlands 

As a part of the exhibit, there 
are rough sketches of concepts 
and ideas, along with minutely 
detailed drawings, photographs, 
models and an audio-visual pres-
entation relating to the architects' 
ideas. There are also many exam-
ples of the architects' progression 
from sketch to finished work. 

Legorreta is known as "Mexico's 
Mexican Architect" because he 
utilizes his knowledge of tradi-
tional Mexican architecture in his 
works. The models and photo-
graphs displayed at the Gallery 
illustrate Legorreta's use of vibrant 
colors and geometric shapes, as 
well as the buildings' overall har-
mony with their surroundings. 
Legorretr. uses the different land-
scapes to enhance his deSigns, such 
as the Camino Real Hotel where 
the oceanic backdrop is a good 
contrast to the geometric shape of 
the hotel. He is currently working 
on designing the International 
Student Center at UCLA, as well 
as the High-tech Museum of Sil-
icon Valley in San jose. 

Maki's works use elements of 
advanced technology . He focuses 
on the use of different materials, 
such as granite and stainless steel, 

to achirve a futuristlc look. In his 
model of the Tokyo Science 
Museum, Maki tries to achieve 
visual harmony from all angles. 

He states that, "Art should be 
enjoyed, even while having tea," 
meaning that a project should be 
pleasing to the eyes no matter 
what one is doing. The unusual 
roof design of the Tokyo Metro-
politan Gymnasium was influ-
enced by pictures of old japanese 
temrles and shrines, a great con-
trast to its otherwise modern look 
created through Maki's use of 
stainless steel. Maki blends ideas 
of old with advanced technology 
design and materials to achieve his 
own unique style. 

Meier stresses the importance 
of light, space, and form in his 
works, while also being concerned 
with the social impact of architec-
ture. His most important and most 
recent project is designing the 1Â· 
Paul Getty Center in Brentwood, 
California. The rr.odel of this cen-
ter shown at the Gallery reveals 
how he considers the total sur-
rounding landscape when decid-
ing on his designs. He prefers sim-
plistic styles to complement the 
surroundings. 

Rogers is noted for his empha-
sis on urban projects. One of his 
exhibits at the Gallery is his view 
of London as it could be if he 
renovated certain aspects of the 
city. Rogers believes that art, 
science, history, politics, and eco-
nomics are all essential aspects of 
architecture. But innovation is 
most important because it results 
in new designs . 

One of Rogers' most innovative 
projects was the Pompidou Cen-
ter in Paris, where he mixed bright 
colors with a tangle of pipes and 
beams. In the 'Gallery exhibit, 
Rogers is represented by his visions 
of "London As It Could Be," 
Alcazar (a clothing and textile cen-
ter in France), and the Double-
ment Amont du Pont d'Auster-
litz, which is a suspension bridge 
over the Seine river. 

The common thread between 
these four architects is their vision 
of looking toward the future 
through their progressive designs. 

This exhibit will run until Feb. 
26 at the Mandeville Art Gallery. 
The Gallery is open from noon to 
5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, 
and there is no admission charge.

Vernon Fisher is on view at the La 
jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art until April 2. 

Fisher combines drawing, paint-
ing, photography, sculpture, text, 
and objects he has found in works 
that range from room-size installa-
tions to small diptychs and trip-
tychs to free-standing sculpture. 

Night Watch, 1985 
pieces that were characterized by a 
witty fusion of language and visual 
imagery. Until 1985 Fisher com-
bineJ images and text in individ-
ual and sequential panels. 

Later his work expanded into 
multi paneled assemblages, includ-
ing sections painted directly on 
walls. These also incorporate 
objects he has found - ranging 
from comic strip images to porce-
lain urinals - and sculptural ele-
ments that give the works a sur-
realistic overtone . 

Fisher's images anJ anecdotes 
center on everyday events gone 
awry and reflect the artist's strong 
ties to the Southwestern literary 
tradition. 

Instead of trying to investigate 

and copy so-called reality like 
some art does, Fisher's work is 
more about the nature of percep-
tion. For Fisher, the world is a 
huge network of artificial signs 
that structure "real life" as we 
know it . 

Recu rring imagery such as 
globes, blackboards, navigational 
charts, and cartoon characters 
reiterate Fisher's focus on ways of 
perceiving and receiving infor-
mation. 

Fisher, who has received nation-
al and inrernational recognition, 
promises to be one of the most 
exciting artists shown in San Diego 
this year. Don't miss this mid-
career retrospective.

DRAGON CHOW IS THE STORY OF CHINESE RESTAURANT, HE BECOMF.~ 

Though you can catch him in polyester, his h air is not greasy. It's well ... very, vl:ry long 
Bur it's not his looks that make LJavid Lindley unique, it' his incredible talent as a musician. 

Tonight at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach (long may it live) you can treat yourself to 
hearmg Lindley perform with his band, El Rayo-X. 

Eccentric as it is, describing Undley's appearance is easier than trying to categorIze hi. 
musIc. Although he play~ almost every strin&~d instrument imaelnable duringliw ptÂ·rfor-
man es, he sticks primanly to the e1 ... ctnc gUItar and the bouzouki (A TurkIsh Insrrument). 

Most of his mUSIC IS labeled either reggae or rock 'n' roll, but It'S more of a crazy quilt of 
differ,'nt Influ ... nces - from Middle Eastern melodIes and rhythm and blues, to folk, 
flamenco, country and bluegras . 

"Everything I've ever hea rd that I have bt!en inspired by, o r infl uenced by in some way, has 
become a part of my music," says LIndley. " It has never mattered to me that these influences 
and different styles of musIc have come from opposite ends of this tiny planet ." 

Very Greasy, his fifth album with EI Rayo-X , reflects all of these influences. Despite 
Li ndley's p ro wess as a musician, the album is somewhat disappo inting in its i~consiste~cl es. 
Only the first and last two songs are outstanding. The rest are competent, enjoyable plece.s, 
but not up to the standards he se t with h is first two albums. StIli, the album as a whole IS 
defi nitely worth listening to, especially if you need a change from the likes of 91X's 
techno-pop or KGB's pounding fo ur-four time. 

The first song, "Gimme Da' Ting," comes from the Trinidadian calypso songbook of Lord 
Richter (which is enough in itself to make the song intriguing). It does what Lindley's m1,lsic

'True Believer' Offers Suspense 
by julie sonntag 

hiatus writer 

A Golden Globe Award Nominee for his role as a cop-killer 
in The Onion Field, James Woods is currently o n the other side 
ofrhe law, starring in Columbia Pictures' True Believer. W oods 
plays , Eddie Dodd, a cy nical defense attorney, known for his 
loopho le tactics in acquitting drug dealers. 

The murder mystery begins as Dodd unwillingly takes on a 
murder case at the insistence of his new associate, Roger Baron, 
played by Robert Downey, Jr. 

Downey, Jr., best known for his role in The Pick-Up Artist, 
plays an ideal istic law school graduate who remembers Dodd in 
his former days as a champion of the underdog and civil 
liberties. 

This unlikely pair takes on the case of Shu Kai Kim, a Sing 
Sing prison convict, who is accused of kill ing a fellow prisoner. Behind bars in True Believ~rs 
KIm is portrayed by Yuji Okumoto. 

The m ystery unfolds as Dodd and Baron investigate Kim's original crimei the murder of a Chinese 
gang leader in New York's Chinatown. After uncovering facts indicating a possible cover up, the 
attorneys risk their lives trying to find evidence to prove their claim. 

Woods and Downey both put in excellent performances, effectively carrying the suspense of the 
movie as well as adding a touch of comedy to this drama. .. . . 

The most unrealistic part of the film is a character flaw in the convict, Shu Kal KIm. KIm magIcally 
changes from a hardened criminal to a clean-cut young American by the end of the film. 

The cinematography is very innovative, displaying creative use of black and white film to comple-
ment the scenes in color. 

The last key component of the story is the pace of the film . Without boring the audience, the timing 
allows for a large amount of action to be packed into two hours . 

Overall, I would recommend this movie to those adventurous moviegoers who enjoy the suspense 
and intrigue of a good mystery drama.

by christina huizar 
hiatus writer 

An image pops into my head 
when I think of rhe dance com-
pany's name, Ballet Hispanico. I 
picture the folkloric quality of 
beautiful young men and women 
swaying to the sound and vibra-
tions of their heri rage. 

They click their heels rogether 
in unison with castanets snapping 
vigorously above their heads. The 
women swing their hips. their 
beautiful dresses gracefully swirl-
ing to the festivity. 

This image of a Hispanic folk-
loric dance materializes with a 
dancing style that is passionate 
and complex, a style that ventures 
into other cultures, other historic 
areas and choreography. 

The Ballet Hispanico, a 12-
member professional touring 
dance company from New York, 
will give a one-night only perfor-
mance Saturday, Feb. 11 at the 
Mandeville Center Auditorium. 

"Their seemingly expansive 
arms and legs evoke images of the 
straightforward, celebrated sen-
suality typically associated with 
the Caribbean drums," according 
to dance critic Judith Smith. 

Dancer Maria Mackerui will 

Passionate Pride 
perform a solo with her articulate 
hands expressing both grand and 
subtle emotion. Her body exhibits 
the freedom found in the arena of 
serious discipline. 

All of the dancers in Ballet His-
panico have received wide acclaim 
for their ability to express beauty 
in dance. 

The choreography of the pieces 
to be performed Saturday night, 
along with the costumes, lighting 
and music, should prove to be a 
very wonderful and powerful 
surprise. 

The Ballet Hispanico of New 
York was established 19 years ago 
when minority children had little 
hope for careers in the performing 
arts and when there was consider-
able prejudice against the rapidly 
growing Hispanic community. The 
Ballet Hispanico was established 
by Tina Ramirez, one woman who 
recognized these problems and the 
need for the company. 

Ramirez began the Ballet His-
panico after she promised to take 
over her reti ring Spanish dance 
teacher's studio. 

Since it started in the small stu-
dio in New York City, the Ballet 
Hispanico has moved inro two 
historic buildings and has given 
performances in Italy, France, 

Venezuela and rhe Virgin Islands. 
The Ballet Hispanico is not just 

a touring dance company. It also 
has provided low cost profeSSional 
dance instruction to over 900 
people, and administers over 60 
scholarships to qualified dancers. 

The Ballet Hispanico has one 
main goal that it tries to fulfill 
within every aspect of the dance 
company. The aim is to promote a 

deeper understanding and appre-
ciation of America's Hispanic 
culture. 

In doing so the company is able 
to strengthen Hispanic Americans' 
pride in their own cultura I heritage. 

Saturday's performance should 
excite audiences not only through 
dance, but through the com pany's 
costumes, music, choreography, 
rhythm and pride. 

The fact that Lindley doesn't 
play large auditoriums is not be-
cause he is unable to draw a big 
enough crowd, but because he 
relies on his skill, not volume, to 
create an exciting concert. In be-
tween the extremes of harsh and 
muted notes , Lindley explores an 
incredible range of sounds - his 
is not stereotypical, cookie-cutter 
music. 

As o ne musician friend put it, 
"His concerts ca n be a revelation 
in terms of the subtlety of sound 
that can arise from a rock 'n ' roll 
band. II

Injury 
Continued from page 11 
bone popped up, a nd now it won'L 
ever go back down. The ligaments 
that held the bone down, 1 think 
there were three or four of them, 
are torn. 

Gerlach - The ankle is sup-
posed to be stronger than before, 
when it's compleLely healed, which 
will be in another eight to ten 
months - it will probably be 
longer now that I've been playing 
on it when I shouldn't have been. 
Other than that , I'm fine. Basket-
ball has helped me out, and has 
kept me in great shape. Football 
players, however, have especially 
bad knees. I played in high school 
at wide receiver and could feel 
[my playing] taking its toll . 

Meier - 111 probably have 
sore knees when I'm older. My 
dad plays a lot of tennis and his 
knees and back are going. Shoul-
ders go too ... tennis gets pretty 
much everything ... it includes 
Slopping and starting, and add 
the twisting and turningin serving 
and other strokes. The main thing 
is in terms of my knees and 
ankles. 

Editor's note: The third and 
final portion of this article will be 
concluded in the Monda)' issue of

Thursday, February 9, /989 

Fisher, Ross light up the Superstar, 
Well, folks It s over for another 

ear You know That Superstars thing 
ey run every year down at the 1M 

Department And frankty. they oughta 
hang that baby up forever I mean 
after last weekend 's recordÂ· splitting 
resulls. who would ever want to try It 
again? I mean, reallyl 

The numbers that got rung up were 
Incredible And right where everyone 
pictured them, at the head of the 
class, were JJ Fisher and Linda Ross 
Now these two youngsters know how 
to play sports 

Thai was prelly much eVident last 
Sunday as Fisher and Ross, a couple 
of very QUiet. unassuming athletiC ' 
oriented dynamos ran away and hid 
from the field In the 14th UCSD 
Superstars AllÂ· Sports Compelilion 

Running away and hiding was only 
half of It. believe me These two Just 
plain dominated from the opening 
gun In the 60Â·yard dash, all the way 
through the grueling, weatherÂ· plagued 
fourÂ·day event that finished With a 
oneÂ· mile run In the biller cold of an 
arCIiC Sunday afternoon 

The overall champion was Flshe~ 

With a phenomenal 6501 pOint total 
that goes begging for CritiCism Let's 
face It, th iS guy can do It all HIs two 
throwaway scores (In the best 8 of 1 0 
event competition) were 600+ scores 
In sWimming and field goal kicking 
that most others In the competltton 
would have killed for 

And then there s Ross, who had 
qUite a weekend herself Her 6487 
total pushed Fisher to the limit and 
was a huge 584, polnt Improvement 
over last years recordÂ· seiling WOÂ° 
mens total 

To show you how close she came 
to being the first women's overall 
champion In Superstars history, lust 
conSider that one more free throw In 
the basketbdll shooting event would 
have given her the necessary t 5 
POints needed to Win It all But she 
dldnt. and that's Superstars There's 
always next year 

And that's the scary part Both 
Fisher and Ross Will probably be 
back for more next year, and believe 
It or not, thEY stili have more potential 
In some of the events 

After watching them thiS year that s 

hard to believe. Fisher established 
two new Individual event marks With a 
375-lb bench press and a 314-ft 
laser beam throw In the softball 
thrOWing event Ross maxed out the 
1000' polnt tables In three eventsÂ·Â· 
welg Iftlng (175-lbs), field goal kickÂ· 
Ing (5-for-5/1 07 total yds ), and basÂ· 
ketball shooting With 40 POints In a 
oneÂ· minute time trial 

When everything was over said, 
and done with. Fisher had become 
the fourth twoÂ· tlme champion In the 
event (tle also won as a sophomore), 
the new c areer Superstars pOint 
recordholder (24, 456), and the class 
recordholder for seniors, JUniors and 
sophomores 

Ross had eclipsed every prevIous 
mark In the book, man or woman, With 
her 6487 total and seemed perfectly 
content WIth her secondÂ·placefintsh when 
we saw her the next day 

Content baloney'We'li be hearÂ· 
Ing from Linda about Ihls time next 
year and I have a feehng that second 
place Will not be qUite good enoughl

MID-SEASON 

REPORT 
ThiS has been one of the most 

competrtlve seasons In recent memory 
The NFL has partty, and so does 
UCSD Intramural Basketball As we 
sWing Into the final three weeks of play 
most of the league titles are stili up for 
grabs It s time to get sertous and 
make those final adJustments to fine 
tune your team for a run at the title 
Here IS a took at each diVISion to date 
With an eye on the upcoming games 
that may make or break a season 

The talent In Men', AlIA has been 
spread evenly over several contendÂ· 
Ing teams Courtslde observers fell 
that the Wednesday night Pistons 
league was much tougher than the 
Sunday Lakers league, but as the seaÂ· 
son has progressed the difference 
between the Iwo has started to fade 
The topÂ·ranked Pub lic Enemy from

In Wednesday Feb 22 Netter,AIIlrm-

alive Action, a nd Dell Gun. Will bat 
tie for the 3rd and 4th playoff SPOts In 
The Pistons league 

In the LaKerS Ledgue Icemen looKs 
to be the cream olthe crop At 4 0 they 
are alone atop the standings The 
knock against Dan Mulvllie s crew IS 
that they don t playas a team If Dan 
can keep all the role players happy 
while Tim Rapp (who steped up 10 
Intra murals for thiS season) runs the 
show they could figure In the cham 
plonshlp game Others In the Lakers 
League who have shown flashes of 
greatness Include Ral.,. "" , Super. wo". and Penetrate and Shoot. 
One of Ihese could prOVide a formid-
able opponent In the playoffs The Clip-

records In futility The" average marÂ· 
gin of loss IS 79 pOints, but they are 
leading 1M 's In 3, polnt shoohng With 
an average of 42 attempts a game 
(unfortunately they are only shooting 
3% from the field ) 

In Ihe Men'. M diVISion we see a 
Wide diverSIty of style Several teams 
employ the upÂ· tempo fullÂ·tIIt style that 
has become popular In the NCAA, 
while others are winning With a more 
panerned structure I.aIt Chance For 
The Or.am has gone through some 
personnel changes from last year but 
remains the top pOint scorer In AA With 
310 At thiS pOint In the season they 
are the BudMan's chOice to finally get 
the monkey off their back and Win It all 
thiS year Shott lui Slow and Rim Rld-
er. are both undefeated ,n the Hawks 
league but are not blOWing anyone out, 
winning games by an average of 7 and 
9 pOints respectively (they meet,pos, 
slbly for the league title, on March 7) 
Stay Out Of Our Houle IS leading the 
Rockets league but Dinner I, Served 
and EatIng Raoul are not far behind 
Look for House to be there on ChamÂ·

Cock8cl has a big reputallon for chokÂ·

Will do Just that again thiS year The

UCS(J Superstars '89 

Records fall in bunches 
Either the moon was aligned Just perfectly In the universe thiS past 

weekend, or UCSD studentÂ· athletes are ttred of their academlcsÂ·only 
Image In the world 

In reality both Wpr'l and are probably true, Based on results from the 
Superstars competition, athletiC achievement was Indeed a very cool 
and "In" thing thiS past weekend, 

In an event that turns over new records on the average of 2 or 3 per 
year, Superstars '89 left all prevIous years in stardust With an amazing 
10 new records-seven of them coming In IndiVidual events 

And It wasn't iust the JJ and Linda show as you might expect There 
were plenty of other super athletes out there thiS past weekend 
plugging away at those ugly pOint tables. and vOilal - a bunch of them 
came through With some amazing performances Here's a recap, 
Alamaworl Young Tobin ... thiS powerfully bUilt Nigerian exchange 
student did what comes natural to someone of hiS size and bUild He 
benched the whole rack (375 Ibs )In the welghtllft lng event and had 
more to give We Just didn 't have enough extra weight for '-obln Thank 
goodness, he might have made the eXisting pOint tables look like a 
loke 
Tim Andre ... little Tim IS heir apparent to the Superstars title If Fisher 
and Ross ever graduate from thiS place Right now he's marking hiS 
lime paliently till hiS day In Ihe sun. The third place finisher overa ll 
(6054) had a career day In the field goal kicking event With a perfect 
5-for-5 from 40 yards out (200 total yds .) Tim's 1000 POints In the 
event broke Ihe old record by 125 
Carin Crawford/ Terrie Pleva .. . after watching the women's 50Â·yd 
freestyle sWimming record (28,10 by Linda Buchanon) survive for 13 
years, the tM Superstars staff was beginning to believe thiS was some 
kind of mystical mark But then Carne and Teme came along last 
Friday evening to put some new teeth Into the 50Â·free record Carin 
won the event In an excellent 26.77 With Teme right behind In 27 75 
BOlh picked up 900+ POints for thetr efforts 
Matt laldefston â€¢ .. thiS sophomore rugby player wasn 't haVing the 
grealest of compelilions unlil Sunday's high Jump event showed up on 
the schedule But when It did, he took full advantage of the opportunity 
After almost missing three limes at 5-10, Matt cleared 6-0, 6-2 and 
6.3

"
, on hiS first aHempts to establish a new Superstars record for the 

event
