Former Congressman 

Lowenstein calls for Nixon defeat 
Allard Lowenstein. lead r of 

th e 1968 " Dump LBJ" 
campaign and organi zer of the 
1972 " Dump Nixon ' 
movement. spoke to a crowd of 
about ISO students Tue.day. on 
R velie Plaza . at an ' AS-
sponsored .. register to vot 
rally. " 

The mam pomt of his addr ss 
was that "Nixon has not kept 
his campaign promises" and 
therefore " he should be 
replaced " Lowenstein . a 
former congre man from :'-lew 
York . began his talk by 
outlining the "obvlou 
problems of the country" 
Among them he included the 
continuing war In VietNam. the 
economy. racial tensIOns. and 
tax ineqUities. Lowenstein 
went on to accu e the ixon 
Administration of deceiving 
the American people with " lies 
in place of social justice and 
peace. " 

Lowen stein sternly 
condemned these dlscrepancle' 
in Amertcan Ideals. but QUickly 

Students to have voice in Dem 
delegate selection next week 

Students who are registered 
Democrats have an opportunity 
to become delegates to the 
pa rty's national convention in 
Miami under rules adopted last 
year . The rules. which are 
designed to encourage more 
active participation by 
ord inary Democrats. have the 
force of law in California since 
they were adopted by the State 
Legislature. 

Under the new system any 
Democrat actively supporting 
a particular candidate has the 
opportunity to be a delegate . 
District caucuses will be held 
m each Congressional district 
for the purpose of proposing the 
na mes of registered 
Democrats as delegates and 
al ternates pledged to each 
candidate for Presidential 
nominee. 

The caucuses will be held on 
reb , 12. which is next 
Saturday. Separate caucuses 
will be held by each candidate 
commencing at \0 a .m. on that 
da te . A registered Democra t 
from each district will be 
designated by each candidate 
to preside oyer his caucus. 

Caucuses are open to all 
registered Democrats. Only 
registered Democrats who 
have signed a statement of 
support for the candidate for 
whom the meeting is being held 
may participa te in the 
proceedings of the caucus. 
Persons who are not now 
registered as Democrats may 
register before next Saturday 
by coming to the TRITON 
TIMES office. and registering 
with one of the deputy 
Registrar of Voters there. 
Persons may also register with 
any deputy registrar of voters 
in San Diego County, 

The first order of business at 
each caucus will be the 
ratification of a registered 
Democrat designated from the 
district to serve on the 
can didate ' s statewide 

organization committee. Each 
caucus shall recommend to the 
candidate ' s statewide 
organizing committee names 
of registered Democrats 
residing in the congressional 
district not to exceed twice the 
minimum allocated to the 
district. The allocation to each 
district will be computed by a 
special formula based on past 
democratic voting patterns in 
the district and the population 
of the district. Alternates will 
also be selected on the same 
basis. 

After consultation with the 
candidate or his 
representatives , and after 
giving due consideration to the 
names recommended by the 
district caucuses . the 
statewide organizing 
committee shall select 88 
percent of the delegates and 88 
percent of the alternates. 

The remaining members of 
the delegation will be selected 
at a statewide meeting of the 
delegation of the winning 
candidate following the 
presidential primary on June 6. 
Each delegate mu t pledge to 
support his candidate until 
released by him or until he fails 
to receive 'at least IS percent of 
the vote on an ballot a t the 
convention in ' Miami Beach 
from July 10-13. 

Below are the locations of the 
San Diego caucuses for each 
Democratic candidate who has 
announced a caucus. Persons 
who are not sure which 
Congressional district they 
reside in should call the County 
Registrar of Voters at 278-9400'.

Lowenstein, a Democrat,

In response to a student

Former Chancellor interviewed 

"Hi, I'm Bill McGill" 
(Graduate 01 UCSD in 1970, 

Roger Sbowley was news editor 
of the Triton Times for two 
years . He now works at the 
Republican National 
Committee in Washington, 
operating tbe Washington 
Campus News Service for 
college newspapers and radio 
stations.) 

W ASHINGTO - It had been 
over 16 months since I last met 
William J . McGill. This time he 
was on my territory of 
Washington. D.C. - where one 
is free of the relatively stirJing 
climate of New York City. But 
UCSD 's one-time chancellor 
and now president of Columbia 
University has changed very 
little. 

He still bounces up steps. 
shakes hands vigorously and 
introduces himself With a " H), 
I'm Bill McGill ." 

Wilham J McGill has now 
presided over the affairs of one 
of America 's (former? ) great 
universities for three 
semesters . He and his family 
occupy a large Victorian 
mansion of 1912 vintage 
nearby. And he hobnobs With 
New York VIPs - from its 
ambitious. though ineffectual. 
mayor. to its accomplished but 
tired governor. and to the 
bigWigs that occupy the eastern 
half of the country. especially 
in the nation 's capital. 

When our Chancellor McGill 
left UCSD in August 1970. I was 
sure he left because of a 
personal ambll10n to move up 

to a big university 
presidency. then to a cabinet 
post. then to the head of a 
government agency or 
education Institution. where 
power. politics and posillon 
would mean that he HAD 
MADE IT 

Well . Bill McGill fooled me. 
and has probably fooled others 
who knew him 'two years ago 
when . in February 1970. he 
announced his (already 
rumored I decision to leave the 
groves of La Jolla academia 
[or the concrete jungle of ew 
York 

all got their wish : Da vis stayed 
on. Marcuse kept his contract. 
and Murphy moved from dean 
to vice chancellor. And McGill 
got his job in NYC. 

But at Columbia. where the 
" little war" of 1968 lingered on 
in his maiden tour of the 
student scene - he spent an 
hour fending off charges and 
demands at a " welcoming tea " 

he met political 
professionals . ot the phony 
Washington types who have 
only themselves to deal with. 
but the seasoned 
conlrontationeers. Especially 
the professors. who let a would· 
be power-broker know his 
place. or at least think they do . 

Bill McGill sharpened his 
tactics, refined his political 
acumen. and met radicals 
directly . Take a recent 
encounter with Puerto Rican 
and Latin students who 
occupied a university building. 
"The pohce would never have 
done it in San Diego." he 
recalls. " but in New York I 
made an agreement with the 
police to oust the 
demonstrators but not arrest 
them." Consequently, he called 
in the cops when the 
demonstrators - some 40 of 
them - refused to vacate the 
premises . and had them 
eVicted one by one. " They 
expected to be paraded out as 
martyrs. But once outside. the 

MDrap 

police locked the doors on them 
and they were out in the cold." 
How humiliating for one's ego. 
much less his machismo! 

Bill McGill has retained his 
sense of perspective for two 
reasons . One. already 
suggested. stems from this 
training as an academician. 
who is supposed to have 
learned that a cool eye and 
tolerant attitude conquer all 
prejudice and mistrust. 

But the real reason is that 
our former chancellor is from 
the very area which he now 
governs. He grew up in New 
York. not from the aristocratic 
ingredients of a Kennedy or 
Lindsay . but from the 
fountainhead of an Irish 
immigrant family. hopeful that 
a move to America meant a 
new life and new opportunity. 
McGill weathered the 
challenge of an upward climb. 
And he made it to Columbia 's 

• faculty. only to find that what 
he had achieved was the 
realization that academic 
freedom meant li ttle more than 
keeping pace with the 
publishing rat race . " When I 
saw the little old professor 
stumbling along in front 01 
me. " he likes to recall.'" knew 
that I didn 't want to go down 
with Columbia." 

Second Act. Scene. UCSD. 
Time. 1969. The record is there 
(in the Tnton Times. if you 

will ) for those few interested 
enough to investigate the 
traumas of Bill McGill as he 
competed with regents. AS 
presidents and nearsighted 
frauds of professors. "1 really 
went to San Diego . because I 
thought it was a paradise. " he 
said at our meeting. " I could 
not have been more wrong. The 
events I went through gave me 
the scare of my life ... 

Then why return to a campus 
that had at least ten times the 
magnitude of problems that our 
now eight year old campus 
faced in 1970? 

McGill explained in that 
February press conference 23 
months ago that it was a 
feeling that he could have more 
impact in the "real world" of 
Columbia, stuck in the middle 
of a black ghetto - "a white. 
elite paradise to blacks." 
Perhaps he really did feel the 
need for greater challenge. 

But I think that the 
fundamental reason for Bill 
McGill 's departure was the 
need to return to the paSt and 
test himself against the cruel . 
competitive, sophisticated 
world that is New York . 
Afterall. he was now returning 
with a black belt in handling 
one of the most astute 
politicians in the country. Gov . 
Ronald Reagan . He would tell 
Columbia where its head 
should be. 

The Sauna Mystique 
By V. Robert Allen. M.D. 

Query: Our gym contains a sauna. 
Medically. wbat are its proper uses, benefits , 
and dangers? In short, I'm looking for some 
factual info to guide me in using the facility . 
I suspect otbers might be interested In this 
information. 

5 minutes is recommended for beginners. 
Stay within these limits and you will 
probably survive. 

Considerable research has been done on 
the physiologic effects of the sauna . There is 
a temporary rise in body temperature. blood 
pressure. pulse rate. basal metabolism, and 
depth of breathing. Urine output decreases 
and an average weight loss of 500 grams 
occurs. (The weight loss is all water and is 
rapidly regained over the next couple of 
days I. None of these effects should trouble 
normal healthy people. 

Bill McGill is still 
prpfessor . 

Moreover. he IS a professor 
of psvchology . who continues to 
view the world around him 
through scientific spectacles. 

Answer : Bathing is said to be man 's oldest 
custom. Whether for ritual purification . 
restoration of health. pure pleasure. or even 
removal of dirt. the bath has been around a 
long time and is here to stay . The sauna . or 
Finnish bath. IS a combinatIOn dry and wet 

a heat bath which . once you 've tried it . you 
either love or hate . Its origin is lost in Viking 
history. 

The'ideal sauna IS made of wood to prevent 
condensation of water and should be well 
insulated To avoid increases in humidity. 
there are supposed to be 2 to 2''2 square 
meters of space per person and the room 
should never be packed with wall-to-wall 
bodies. 

Newcomers to sauna may occasionally feel 
slight light-headedness. rapid heart beat. and 
shortness of breath. The same sensations 
may occur With prolonged bathing . These 
appear to be transient. 

Columbia IS a more 
sophisticated place than UCSD. 
he said over drinks at my pad 
In southeast Washmgton . 
Whereas the radicals at UCSO 
ran causes up the flagpote and 
professors scrambled for a 
piece of the political pie that 
umversity communities seem 
to ba ·ke . Columbia ' s 
establishment knew how to 
mampulate would·be power 
brokers Like Bill McGdl. 

Take the radicals. At UCSD 
j,lLGill wa s conlronted 
repeatedly with " non -
negotiable demands " by 
radical and raCial groups . He 
met face to fa ce With outraged 
San Diego citizens who 
demanded the ouster of the 
hkes of Angela Davis. Herbert 
Marcuse and - yes - George 
Murphy. What happened? They 

I can 't tell you what goes on in our sauna. 
but the way the Finns use it IS simple. 
Essentially . you enter. find a comfortable 
spot on the lauteet, a platform of graded 
steps. and then you sit and sweat. After 
everyone In the room is sweating. someone 
pours water on a pile of hot stones and you 
get a "steam dip" of loyly. You go through 
this 2 or 3 times. accompanied. at least in 
Finland. by vi~orous beating of each other 
with dry leafy birch branches. or vihta. 
You 're supposed to start at the top and finish 
with the soles. Sauna etiquette requires that 
you offer to wash and whisk your neighbor's 
back. After that. you scrub up and take a cold 
shower. 

The dry bulb temperature in a sauna is 
usually kept between 55 and 85 degrees C. 
C13()'185 degrees Fl . The whole experience 
shouldn 't take more than 10 to 20 minutes and 

You shouldn 't take a sauna bath right after 
eating. and contra-indications to saunas are 
any of the following : heart trouble, high 
blood pressure. acute kidney disease. eye 
trouble. acute infections, or epilepsy. It is 
apparently all right during normal 
pregnancy . 

You can get emotional about sau na . 
Empirical claims made by proponents 
Include relief from muscular aches and pains 
after exercise. hardening of the body and 
increased resistance . increased 
accomplishment. prevention of colds. an 
answer to modern stresses. enhanced skin 
ca re . and general cleanliness. People who 
like sauna baths reall y like them. They claim 
to exper ience a pleasantly relaxed feeling of 
well being as well as feeling " squeaky 
clean ." It 's hard to judge whether some 
people are partly experienCing a sense of 
hedonistic pleasure in playing a sado-
masochistic game and " letting it all hang 
out." or are experiencing a variation of the 
old routine of hitting your head with a 
hammer. "because it feel s so good when you 
SLOp."

"EXTRAORDINARY" 
"'EL TOPO ' is an extraordinary movie! A phan-
tasmagoric allegory of Western civilization . The 
film is superior for Jodorowsky's impulse to sa-
tire and surrealism entertains while it slakes the 
popular thirst for blood!" 

- Paul D. Zimmerman , Newsweek 

"UNFORGE'ITABLE" 
"'EL TOPO' is a unique and unforgettable ex-
perience l It is just about everything that has been 
said of it. Because it IS all things to all people. its 
story is a multi·layered ink-blot tesl of references 
and implica tions ." - Martin Mitchell. After Dark 

"MONUMENTAL" 
"' EL TOPO ' is simply a monumental work of filmic 
arl. One is astonished each tIme by patterns and 
shades of meaning never noticed before. It de-
mands to be seen more than once!" 

-Peter Sch,e'dahl In the New York Times 

"MASTERPIECE" 
"' EL TOPO ' (s a masterpiece as much as It IS a 
testament to one man 's genius l A work of incom-
prehensible depth . It IS a 'roadmap to the soulT'

Moon. .. (Continued from page IJ 
"On this basis." said Allven. " we should expect a normal 

satellite of Earth to be something like 100 times smaller than 
our present Moon . For this reason. we believe it highly unlikely 
that the Moon could have accreted. or come together. near the 
Earth." 

Allven and Arrhenius argued that it would be inconsistent to 
advance one theory for the evolution of satellite systems 
elsewhere in the solar system while supporting a different 
theory for the Earth-Moon system. 

" We feel that to regard Earth as a special case is not 
justified." they said. 

If Earth and its satellites had evolved in a normal pattern. 
our planet once could have had between five and 10 satellites. 
according to the UCSD scientists . They said Earth also may 
have had a ring. like Saturn 's ring. comprised of boulder-sized 
particles of matter. 

The possibility that Earth once had satellites in orbit around 
it has long been the ubjcct of speculation But the UCSD 
scientists are the first to predict their number . size and orbits 
as the result of systematic investigation

Dr. Gustaf Arrhenius 
space occupied by these ongmal satellites. either cOllldtng 
With them or forcmg them from their normal orbits In the 
latter ca e. the sa telhtes would ei ther have collided with 
Earth. or been ejected into remote space 

"The large Circular or shghtlv elltpllca l basins on the Moon 
would eem to be features which could mark the resting places 
of these ongmal Earth satellites. Nine such ba SinS. each one 
exceed 109 300 miles In diameter. occur on the Moon Five or 

ix of the e contain mascons. which might well be the 
embedded . spread-out rematns of these mailer bodies. There 
are also Immense Impact areas on our own ~Iobe which might 
have been caused bv colh Ions With these satelhles. ThiS 
possibihty can be expiored sClenl1fically . 

Alfven and Arrhemus argue that the planets satellites. 
comets and asterOIds m our solar system were formed by the 
accreting. or coming together . of sohd parllcles of matter 
formmg "Jet streams. " 

Accordmg to their theory. these jet·stream particles colltded 
and eventually bonded together to form the pnmary bodv In a 
planet·satelhte system . 

" When the solar sy tem itself was formed . most of the mass 
of parllcles came together to lorm the Sun." Alfven said .. The 
remnants formed jet streams. and these eventually co ndensed 
to form the Sun's mne planets. Includmg Earth. Remnants of 
jet streams shll exist m the form of the asterOid belt between 
Jupiter and Mars." 

The same process was repeated. on a miniature scale. to 
form the satelhtes around the planets. the UCSD sclenllsts 
argue. 

Had an observer been present on Earth in those early epocs 
when the satelhtes still Circled our planet. he could have seen 
them clearly , day or night , as miniature moons. accordmg to 
Alfven and Arrhenius . 

In size. Earth 's ancient satelhtes would have measured 
something like 50 to 100 miles 10 diameter The Moon. by 
comparison. has a diameter of 2.160 miles. The mlni·moons 
would have circled much closer to Earth. the scientists said. 
the closest some 12.000 miles away and the larthest some 40.000 
miles. The Moon 's present distance from Earth is about 238.000 
miles 

In shape. said Alfven. Earth 's satellttes probably would have 
been Irregular . hke Phobos and Delmos. the jagged moons of 
Mars. 

Would these satelhtes have been able to evolve and support 
life forms ? 

" We think not," said Arrhemus. "Thev would have been too 
small to hold onto an atmosphere ." . 

Could a crater like the one at Canyon Diablo. Arizona have 
been formed by the impact of an early Earth satellite? 

" No," he said . "The Amona crater IS much too small. There 
is a possibility that one or more of the satelhte hit Earth. but 
we cannot come to any conclUSIOns on thiS before makmg 
certam rather comphcated calculatlons. ThiS IS a matter 
which. however . can be clanhed by computers."

T 0 Hi z Z 0 n e r - By Richard Robinson 

" What Paul really wants to be is prom 
queen ." - Dave Shaw 

Happiness IS being a member of the 
Associated Students' Government. Happme s 
IS, to be more specific. bemg able to retire 
from the high and augu t duties of the AS 
President mto a qUiet smecure as a bus driver. 
It IS being able to mamtaln one's glrlfirend bv 
sending her on tripS to the tune of several 
hundred dollars - without pending a penny of 
one's own money It IS dlscretlOnarv travel 
fu nds. Coffee Hu t jobs. and many. many other 
things I haven 't time to recount here. No 
doubt. there are quite a few that neither I nor 
anyone else outside of the halls of government 
know about. 

ew Vistas 
Actually. the AS doe provide many 

services. some of them quite remarkable In an 
mstltutlon of ItS cale. It ha followed in the 
footstep of the CIty of San Diego In exploring 
new vistas In ineffiCient rapid transit ervlce 
Like ItS splfltual mentor. the San Diego 
Tran It System. the Coast Cruiser proVides an 
excellent drainage channel for excess money. 
while at the same time suffenng from a 
regrettable shortage of patrons. For those who 
like figures . the expenses of the Cruiser dUring 
the Fall Quarter were $2051. ItS income $582 
Of the expenses. 1I01 went for salaries 
What s m store for us with respect to thl 
marvel of mass tran port I a real. true·to-l!\'e

wonder would have set u back S20.000 
Perhaps after we got It Kaufman and 
Compam would have gone to Lake Havasu and 

bou~ht London Bridge to make a matchlllg set 
Once you start spending other people 's mone\. 
Its awfulll hard to stop Part of the " other 
people s monel' . bemg flushed down Into the 
Coast Crul er IS S5G 's from the Regents Fund 
By and large. I am glad to ee The Regents 
spending money for a change. but surely we 
could hnd better things to do With It 

Pa sing "Go" 
Even tho,e services whIch do from tIme to 

tIme actualll get prOVIded , seem to also 
prOVIde a pleasantl~ soft cushIOn In AS 
pockets The ca e of Program Board 
ChaIrman Wallace IS an excellent example. 
ThiS worthy succeeded In absorbing an extra 
$100 last quarter bv becoming chaIrman of one 
of the film senes . We WIll no doubt hear that 
he deserved all thiS money because headmg 
the film group was hard work. espeCially on 
top of hi other dUlles . To thIS . we might replv 
that the work Invohed was not so verI' hard 
that hc could not find time to do It - pa smg 
'Go and collecuni! hiS bread m the process 

Or we might humbl~' uggest that someone 
else ('ould ha\~ i!olten the film Job - someone 
who. haVing more time. ('ould do a more 
thorough Job 

Then there IS the mdtlcr of the Coffee Hut 
Jobs for Paul and Sue A letter bv Steven 
Gnffln m the Jan 28 edition 01 the TT asked an 

interesting qu estIOn : "Why didn 't Kaufman 
simply steal the money if he' a crook. instead 
of getting himself a job for it?" I do not 
believe that Kaufman is an out-and-out crook; 
he is merely employing th ancient political 
privilige of cumshaw If it's acceptible in 

ewark . I suppose I ought not to compla in 
about it at UCSD. 

Hams and Geese 
It would be qUIte a unfaIr to diSCUSS the 

matter of the ASUCSD without contemplating 
for a moment at least that most expensIve of 
ham radIO statIOns, KSDT From my room in 
Argo Hall this communicatIOn medium sounds 
exactly like a station In Los Angeles . the 
statIOn Itself carrie famtly through a 
fascinating as ortment of whi ties and 
rumbles The worth of that feeble , far-off 
SIgnal IS scarcely worth the 22 thousand 
dollars . or thereabouts that has been fed into it 
on a dIrect current line from student monies. 
A member of KSDT gave a ringing defen e of 
It last quarter , dlscussmg the costs of moving 
Mount Soledad or covering It With geese so 
that the signal could reach PB. His point was 
that the.v were domg the best they could. No 
doubt they are, but there best IS not dOing most 
of us much good. Why. then. doe the Big " K" 
go on ItS merry. maudible way through life? 
The reason. of course. IS that the KSDT 
management is among the good ole' boys who 
fast on AS whlskev and rye 

Wa~ing Rich 
There are other Interesting points. of 

course There IS as a last example. the 
Anomalv Fastorv. which waxes nch whl!e the 
hara sed UCSD Drama Dept. stai!gers along 
Just thIS SIde of foundenng In turn for the 
money It gets . the Factorv doesn t even suppl\' 
ch er-Ieaders at the basbetball games any 
more The point IS not that the Factor\' ~hould 
be abolished It shouldn 't - but that If It IS 
gOing to be a qua i-pnvate ex penmental 
group. It should 't be propelled WIth such 
massIve student funding 

All In all . our great leaders have some 
explaining to do . or thev WIll have no one but 
themselves to blame If the coming 
referendum makes the AS go voluntary. ThiS 
of course would have the effect of killing the 
AS com pletel\' - as happened at San DIego 
State a few years ago. Neither I nor most 
other students want this to happen . but it IS 
what happens m the end to all InstItutIOns 
whIch go on too long serving themselves 
In tead of the people they were designed to 
serve. If the student government continues 
spending Its mone:; on sala n es. Junket s. 
Inaudible radiO stations and empty buses. 
Instead of on better flIcks and concerts. and 
other thmgs of use .to us. It may Wind up 
without an,· monel' to spend 

To Kaufman and the Comm Board' There 
are many way's of solVIng the present problem. 
but trVlng to shut up the TRITON TIMES With 
vel!ed threats won 't work Threats and 
censorship are Invanably a sign of weakn ss

"I'm Gonna Shout All 
Reflections on Women's Liberation 

Ry David Kri slofferson 

Most of the people who attended Gloria 
Steinem 's talk last weekend were undoubtedly 
impressed, both by her fine speech and the 
large turnout. Maybe even a few male 
chauvinist pigs were converted during the 
meeting! However, a few points arose in my 
mind which were not adequately covered at 
the talk. After ruminating over them with 

. some friends, both male and female, I have 
decided to serve them up here for the digestion 
and edification of others. 

Unless the poor audio system in the 
cafeteria deceived me. I think I'm correct in 
paraphrasing Gloria 's goal as follows . She 
desires a completely humanistic society in 
which discrimination . especially by physical 
characteristics. does not exist. In simpler 
terms, in such a society every person. 
irregardless of her/ his sex. skin color. etc" 
would have an equal opportunity of developing 
his/ her personality and abilities to the utmost. 
One could hardly ask for a nobler goal. 

Concentrating on the special case of women, 
the necessary means to this ideal society 
consists of overthrowing the myths [a few of 
which GlOria discussed ) that have subjugated 
woman to her present inferior second-class 
ci tizen status, con equently damaging her own 
self-image and chaining her to a life of 
drudgework , i.e" " feminine tasks ". those 
whIch nobody else wants to do .. 

Quite a Hunk of Tradition 

There can be no doubt that these myths of 
femmme inferiOrity have caused tremendous 
psychological damage. But there is one point 
here to remember. These myths which have 
resulted in the male and female roles have 
been psychologica ll ~ ingrained into human 
beings for five thousa nd years. That's quite a 
hunk of tradition to revolt against. Therefore 
If Women 's Lib cannot reverse the tide in a 
fe w years or a generation. It is no cause for 
despair. The movement has started moving. 
That 's what's important. In other words. the 
movement amounts to a p ychological 
revolution again t an extremely strong and 
tubborn habit Such tasks are rarely 

accomplished In a lIfetime. However. mass 
communicatIOn may prove me wrong. 

How then can these myths be most 
effectively dispelled~ How can the image of 
inferiority be destroyed so that it no longer 
causes a woman to look down on herself. or 
subjects her to the scorn of self-proclaimed 
"superiors?" Gloria was correct when she 
said it was a group problem. The chams must 
be cast off Woman. not only a few individual 
women. But how is this done? By legislation? 
Employment quotas for employers? Hardly. If 
women are forced into the system it will only 
serve to perpetuate the myths. They will still 
be considered infeflor because, to anticipate a

highly probable reaction, they had to "stoop" 
to using "devious" means to " inveigle" their 
way into a job which they probably "stole" 
from someone " more qualified." 

" But." one might reply, " who cares what 
the male chauvinist pigs think , just as long as 
we get our jobs !" The rebuttal is quite simple. 
Women might get their jobs, but that in itself 
won 't repair a damaged self-image or 
alleviate male harrassment. The only method 
to repair woman 's self-image is SUCCESS. 
Until she can get in with the best of those 
bastards and give 'em hell in their own terms 
and on their own level, she will not really 
respect herself nor will they respect her. 

Stereotypes Cause Group Harrassment 
If this is the case, then how can Women 's 

Lib be considered a group problem? It is a 
group problem because individuals are 
stereotyped by association wilh the group. 
Relevant to this was the female grad tudent's 
complaint at the meeting about being 
constantly harrassed by snide remarks about 
her presence in law school I" Why don't you 
get married, etc.?" I and by employers 
(" What kind of birth control do you use?",. 
The individual IS harrassed because of the 
stereotype of the group. But the group is 
evaluated by its individuals; each individual is 
a representative. Therefore in order to break 
down the inferiority surrounding Woman. a 
mass effort is necessary by individuals to gain 
the respect of others and THEMSELVES by 
succeeding in unhampered competition. 

I believe this was also the point that the 
woman from Romania was trying to make 
when she was booed and hissed by the peanut 
gallery on the floor. That disgraceful incident, 
one that might be expected from immature 
high school freshmen, not rational adults. 
marred an otherwise informative and well-
conducted meeting . If people had stopped and 
thought (nasty word, "think "). they would 
have discovered that both the Romanian and 
the law student were correct, as I have 
demonstrated here. 

Only by her own individual success can a 
woman restore her self-image and that of her 
group. J[ her sex is the reason that she is 
turned down or paid less than a man for the 
same work by an employer, she has a 
legitimate lawsuit. But the law or other 
political influences and changes in the system 
cannot by themselves restore a woman 's self-
respect. Only she can control that by being 
successful m her own activities . 

In the final ana lysis. even humanism does 
not promise an easy road to success. It can 
only grant ~ual opportunity and some 
assistance. If an individual . regardless of sex 
or race, decides not to work , all the humanism 
in the world won 't make her/him success ful 
and respected.

Night G-I-o-r-i-a!" 
aOOO Years of Humanism 

By Kevin Olson 
It is one-thirty in the afternoon, and I am 

sitting in the Revelle cafeteria waiting for 
Gloria Steinem, reportedly the world's most 
erotic feminist , to make her appearance. The 
cafe is filled to overflowing, the crowd is 
abuzz with excitement. and the temperature is 
increasing exponentially with time. What 
looks like a cross between a faggot and a 
lesbian gets up on the stage and announces 
that Gloria will be late, because her plan~ is 
late, and in the meantime we will be 
entertained by Lynn McClure and Barbara 
Bentwood si nging folk songs. Fair enough, one 
thinks - except that it's getting very hot, and 
no one can hear them sing, and maybe Gloria 
won't come after all . 

After about 20 minutes, she does come - but 
first we must suffer through a sputteringly 
incoherent introduction by one Grazia de Pick, 
who is proud of the fact that she didn 't change 
her name after getting married and doesn 't 
mind telling everybody about it three or four 
times ; then a second introduction by Betty 
Harris, the publisher of Ms. magazine ; and a 
distinguished-looking lady whose major 
intellectual revelation to us is "Oh, wow!" 

But they both yield to the silent audience 
pressure, and finally Gloria Steinem walks to 
the microphone. She is indeed, as I have been 
told . stunning : a perfect body tantalizingly 
hidden in sweater and corduroys, long brown 
hair cascading just so over each breast, 
sinfully sinuous legs , an aristocratic high-
cheekboned face accentuated by blue-tinted 
sunglasses. 

A wistful si~h emanates audibly from some 
of the less (or maybe more ) liberated males in 
the audience as Gloria begins to speak, her 
fingers clenching, now caressing the 
microphone ; for she is, probably against her 
wishes , the very phenomenon her movement 
seeks to destroy : the sex object desired by all 
men ; the sensuous slice of erotica whose sole 
function in life is to rip the thin veneer of 
civilization from the most stalwart of men and 
subordinate him to the whims of his libido. 
Gloria Steinem is It ; the creature of carnal 
knowledge. the secret promise of libertlnism 
masked by just the right amount of Eastern 
seaboard sophistica ted reserve. 

Tbe Bubble Burst s 
Ms. Steinem could. if she so desired. keep 

such thoughts churning in men 's minds 
indefinitely ; but the bubble bursts, the dream 
collapses.when she opens her mouth and 
begins to speak . For Gloria , although she is 
very nice and very pretty, cannot think her 
way out of a paper bag. Even her sultry voice 
cannot mask the ubiquitous irratIOnality, the 
plethora of distortions and inanities that make 
up the " phIlosophy" of Women 's Liberation. 
As I listen to her speak. I am struck by the 
contrast between Gloria 's ultra-sophisticated 
appearance and the barbaric street-culture 
Incoherence of her speech - and wonder If 
they are really so incongruous. 

For about a half-hour she rambles on. from 
sexism to racism, back to sexism. over to 
humanism - all the necessary leftist cliches. 
One could pick at random . and not fail to find 
something embarrassing even to the most

\ , 

sympathetic anti~hauvinist. Gloria says she 
has been studying history, and has arrived at 
the conclusion that for the past 5000 years 
women have been oppressed and subjugated 
by men. The Steinem school of historical 
analysis apparently does not distinguish 
between, say, a tribal society in which women 
are marketable slaves, and the Christianity of 
a Victorian England in which women are 
exalted to the highest ideal of romantic love. 

011 Racism 
On the matter of race relations , Gloria tells 

us that Harvard sociologist Pat Moynihan is a 
racist because he believes that many of the 
things that are wrong with the Black 
community have their causes in the Black 
community itself. Shame on him! We all 
know. of course. that "white racism" is the 
sole cause of all racial strife , and that Blacks 
are not responsible for anything. Gloria then 
gives us a quote from Mr. Bobby Seale of the 
Black Panthers to show us how womens-libbed 
Blacks are : " In a Panther house, everyone 
does the di shes and the housework ." Real 
manhood is not the subjugation of anybody." 
Unfortunately, Gloria does not know that Mr . 
Seale has said a lot of much less liberated 
things about women. among them : " In the 
upcoming Black revolution , the best position 
women can have is prone." 

I quickly tire of Ms. Steinem's oration, and 
examine the audience. They are fairly 
advanced radical~hic . but a little scrawny 
and peaked-looking. The shag haircuts. the 
leather and dirt and scruff are all there . but 
the romantic spontaneity is gone, and the 
people show signs of the dysphoria that has 
affected the movement in recent years. But 
they are all there - aging hippies and nervous 
teeny-bops. neurotic dropouts and alienated 
professors - and they seem at least 
temporarily content. for Gloria is saying what 
they want to hear. regardless of its 
relationship to reality . They are eating it up. 

Gloria is winding up now and concludes her 
di ssertation with a definitely unique 
summation of world history: (11 For the first 
5000 years of civilization. women were in a 
superior and god-like position in ociety. [ 2 ) 
For the past 5000 years. women have been in 
an oppressed and inferior position in society. 
Therefore. through some strange Hegelian 
dialectiC , it follows that (3) for the next 5000 
years we will have " total humamsm." I.e. a 
society where no one is oppressed or superior 
to anyone else. End of speech. 

Upon hearing this. I conclude that [ 1 ) Gloria 
Steinem is hopeless. and of no intellectual 
consequence. [2) If she is a princi pal force in 
the movement. then the movemen t is of no 
intellectual or political consequence and i 
nothing to worry about, and (3) There is 
something seriou Iy wrong with a society 
where so many people get so excited over such 
despicable nonsense. 

Gloria thanks everyone for listening to her 
speech. and says that there will now be a 
dIscussion group. followed by a meeting with 
Somebody-or-other Liberation Front and 
similar groups. I do not stay around for these 
events.

Warning 
Editor. 

There IS a ChlOe e-Lalln 
revolutionary wandering on 
various campuses gelling 
draft-age men stoned and 
counseling them to make the 
wrong chOices concerning their 
draft commitment. He then 
proceeds to screw the guy In 
the arse. and sometimes in the 
process nps him off for all he 's 
worth. mind . soul. and bodv 

For instance . he got' one 
UCLA student who was on a 2-S 
deferment to give up his 2-S. 
calling it a cop-out The guy 
gave up his 2-S when he dug 
that it was a cop-out. and 
proceeded to try to deCIde 
whether to go in the service or 
turn in his card . The Chinese 
dude got the cat stoned again a 
couple of weeks later and 
convinced him to take a 1-Y 
psychiatric classification. The 
student paid $200 to a doctor 
and got his 1-Y. Then the 
counselor got him ripped on 
grass and acid. told hIm he had 
to deserve his 1-Y to keep It , 
and commenced to put the dude 
on the super-bummer tl)at 1) 
guaranteed him a permanent 1-
Y: 2) npped him off for all his 

bread . his clothes, hiS 
apartment. his car. and his 
chick: and 3) convinced the guy 
to drop out of school and 
become an ascetic. 

The guy complied I while 
stoned) ; and then the Chinese 
"revolutionar\," deCided he 
should be the teacher of thIS 
new ascetic and screwed the 
guy m the head so that he IS 
still wandering around looking 
for himself (ha-ha) three years 
later 

In addlllon. the cat IS 
convinced he's going to die In a 
few months and IS desparately 

tr~'lng to come down to hIS bodl' 
Just to say good-bye to It. 

Just thought I'd send the 
message along.

The engineering department is in charge of 

keeping KSDT on the air. We are now on 
carrier current transmission which means 
that our transmitter, instead of feeding power 
to an antennae and radiating energy over the 
airwaves, feeds power through the power lines 
in the dorms. The signal unfortunately has a 
buzz characteristic of carrier current 
operation but experimenting with the 
poSitioning of the radio in a room can improve 
reception of KSDT (tip the radio on its side for 
instance). If the FCC approves our FM 
application. of course we can transmit a better 
signal in stereo to a larger audience . 

John Clarke 
17: It appears the 60 cycle 
humm has become a topic of 
controversy in the last few 
days. What exactly is it? 
KSDT : These factors create 
distortion which results in the 
infamous 60 cycle humm that is 
audible over the air. Once we 
go FM there will be no 60 cycle 
humm because we will have a 
real live radio station with a 
real live transmitter. 
17: Just when will KSDT be a 
"real live radio sta tIOn"? 
KSDT : Well . that is a looong 
story . It all began about 
November 1. At that tim~ 
KSDT had completed the FCC 
application to go FM. [t 
consisted of 6 copies. about 250 
pages each. and included such 
little known facts as the State 
of California's constitution. the 
by-laws of the Untversity of 
California. aerial maps. the 
financial holdings of all the 
Regents. and all sorts of other 
garbage. 
Once the application was filled 
out we left it with Dean 
Murphy. He decided that the 
applicatIOns should be bound in 
hardback. The gIrl who was 
supposed to bind them got sick 
after gelting about half-way 
through the first copy I in the 
middle of November I At the 
beginmng of Wmter quarter [ 
went In to see If the 
applications had been sent out 
and found them 10 a half·bound 
state . After recovenng from 
the IOi1Iai shock of fmding the 
applicatIOns sllll silting on the 
desk . the partia I bindings were 
removed and the appllcalions

The copies were sent to the 
Regents. who techmcally own 
the stalton. to sign and from 
there It has been forwarded to 
the FCC Barring any more 
unforseen difficulties. we 
should have our construcllon 
permit by this Spring. At that 
time we will begin the AM-FM 
technical changeover when 

Page 6 Triton Times February 4, 1972 

that 's done. we'll be on the air. 
17: Will we still be KSDT? 
KSDT : Well . it seems the 
KSDT call letters have already 
been spoken for by a radio 
station m South Dakota. Why 
would anyone want the call 
letters KSDT? Well , the 
answer is, there is .10 reason at 
all . Some people have perverse 
imaginations. Speaking of 
perverse imaginations ... 
having no FM call letters we 
found ourselves launched on a 
epical quest for a name 
befitting our illustrious almost-
a-radio station KELP was one 
idea but it turned out another 
station had it. KILO was 
another suggestion but

station in EI Paso Texas beat 
us to it. KRUD. KIEF. KZWE

so possibilities of sharing a studio convention to record the events 
that take place. 

TT: How do you view KSDT, 
and soon KZWE. as a part of 
our community? 
KSDT : We are trying to 
provide an alternative media 
for our comm unity. An 
alternative to the tin voice 
which has been imbedded in the 
ears of the people for so many 
years. anet hsitiz ing and 
poisoning so many minds . We 
thmk we provide some sort of 
an alternative to Jack-in-the-
Box radio. We want to 
stimulate. educate. inform. 
captivate, arouse, embrace the 
community. 
TT: Will you be broadcasting 

over the summer and during 
the Repu blican Convention? 
KSDT : We are currently in the 
middle of negotiati ng ' a plan 
which would enable KSDT to 
continue broadcasting over the 
summer. We have been in 
contact with the executives of a 
radio station in LA about the 

for the convention period. At 
this time, we don 't know the 
time period which would be 
involved, but it may possibly 
extend all summer. I n the 
event that this arrangement 
works out. we would share our 
facilities with the other station 
and they would give us 
information and foo t the 
operating costs. 

The Pacific Coast Radio 
Network presents an 
alternative solution. It is an 
organization of Western college 
radios stations. They include 
among others the UC. Statl!. 
and Stanford stations. PCRN 
wants to set up a mobile unit in 

San Diego during the 
conve nti on . There is a 
possibility that they may want 
to work out of the UCSD 
station. 
We are also exploring a 
number of other alternative 
solution which would enable us 
to be on the air during the 

TT: Have you made any 
attempt to procure press 
passes that would allow on-the-
spot-coverage? 
KSDT : KSDT's former news 
director wr ote to the 
Republican Convention 
Committee In Washington DC 
asking for info about the 
conditions under which medias 
were granted press passes. 
When the quarter ended, we 
still had no reply . We called up 
Joseph McGaffney in 
Washington , . DC , the 
Republican Press credentials 
man, and he said he "didn 't 
know anything about college 
media ." McGaffney told us to 
call his superior in Kansas who 
would know what was 
happening. The man in Kansas 
told the news director to write 
him a letter. and that has been 
done . Besid es official 
Republican press passes we 
are also '!xploring other 
possible alternatives one of 
which is obtaining press passes 
as member of PCRN. Also the 
station is still trying to obtain 
SDPD approval for CHP press 
passes. 
TT: In the event of any trouble, 
do you think that the press 
passes will be effective in 
wa ylayi ng po ssi ble 
harassment? 
KSDT : All a press pass does is 
identify you as a member of the 
media. If you are going to get 
arrested. you are going to get 
arrested. Having long hair 
brings the possibilities of 
arrest up. so does having a 
tape-recorder. and a camera. 
Press passes ostensibly serve 
to admit a reporter to news 
events taking place (ie. a 
caucus. a demonstration. a 
nominating session). But f 
don 't think we have any 
illusions as to the omnipotence 
of the passes. Our reporters 
have had bona fide credentials 
torn up and discarded more 
than once in the past.

Marc Shore 
The production department 

will explore the artistic and 
creative use of the radio as a 
creative medium. All art is 
essentially information, while 
not all information is art, 
unless it is realized within the 
context of a truly innovative 
and creative atmosphere. The 
pursui ts of the production 
department will extend beyond 
making station IDs and Public 
Service Announcements to 
become an important factor 
in KSDT's total programming. 
The department can exploit the 
potential of radio broadcast 
equipment to its fullest. 
Through such techniques as 
recording, splicing. editing. 
dubbing. etc. tskills which are 
all easily acqUired) certain 
effects can be achieved which 
cannot be achieved in a live 
broadcast. Adaptive and 
original radio drama , comedy , 
satire, poetry. in fact. anything 
that makes radio a more 
interesting entity to listen to 
can be produced. Material 
generated by the production 
department will be inserted 
freely into the broadcast day on 
a non-scheduled basis. This 
department can always use 
creative input, so if you are 
interested contact me (Marc 
Shore) at the radio station.

Fencing team near 
end of fine season 

8y Mark Young 
UCSD's fine fencing congregation travelled all the way to 

sunny (cough. cough ) UCLA last weekend to add their presence 
to the All-Cal Tournament. Unfortunately. they were plagued 
by inconsistency, home sickness, and a strange scoring 
system, and didn't place as well as expected. That is not to say 
they played poorly. but rather they should have, or could have, 
done better. 

In the tournament, the Tritons took third in the women's foil 
with the team of Diane Naffke. Susan Hillary. Terri Breshini, 
Lynn Smith. and Mindy Scott. Men's saber and epee managed 
to take second place in each of their respective categories. 
Placing well were Richard Sax (fourth) and Stan Robinson 
(fifth ) in saber, and John Helmich (third) in epee. The epee 
event was probably the most exciting and well-fenced for the 
Triton team, as Howard Eno. Jim Miller, and Tom Black 
helped Helmich with the fine team finish . Men's foil failed to 
place any contestants in the finals, but the team of Stan 
Robinson , John Helmich. Mike Jones, and John Myers are 
improving with every match. 

Over-all . the Tritons were not as consistent as they have 
been in the past, fencing brilliantly one time but mediocrely at 
another point. One of the reasons for this might be attributed to 
the absence of Patty eal. the vivacious young thing who is 
constantly in motion watching, hoping, and rooting. 

This weekend the team will have a chance to rest their weary 
bones and get some well-deserved rest. On Feb. 11 they 'll 
travel to Long Beach for a dual meet. This meet will be the last 
dual contest of the season. and has the Tritons' 20-meet 
unbeaten, untied streak at stake. ThiS is not the last of fencing 
for this year. however. as coach White has volunteered UCSD 
to host the Western Intercollegiate Conference Championships 
March 3, 4. ~ . For anyone interested In watching some 
extremely good swordsmanship. you might put that date on 
your calendar With a team this good they deserve a little 
backmg.

Triton defense does OK 
The Triton basketballers hit the road last week as they 

boogied up to the country for a pair of games against UC Davis 
and Sonoma State. 

The Saturday night game between Davis and the Tritons was 
a near-rematch of their previous game, which saw Davis 
coming out on top with the identical score, 7~. The refs were 
in rare form , as usual , demonstrating to all their dearth of 
mental awareness. The game was highlighted by bad calls, 
turnovers (what else), and aggressive defense (which, 
incidentally, is a facet of the game that our boys seem to be 
becoming increasingly proficient at). 

Tall Paul Trainer was high man for the La Jolla creatures, 
with 18. This prince of a lad is destined to become the leading 
scorer in UCSD history I girls, take note) and if he stays on the 

Ruggers sneak by 
Loyola 6 to 3 

Each year the UCSD rugby 
team encounters Loyola on the 
field of battle, with Loyola 
usually coming out on top. But 
this year our ruggers finally 
beat them on their home field 
(which must have been used as 
an artillery range in WWII ). 
despite being severely 
hampered by a malady 
common to all UCSD teams : 
" butterfingers." Both teams 
had problems, though , the 
biggest one being how to 
score-as UCSD came out on 
top 6-3. 

Loyola jumped into an early 
3-0 lead on a penally kick as 
rugger Dugger was called for 
head-hunting (you'd think he'd 
be satisfied with a butterfly 
collection J. The e were the 
only points of the first half, 
which was highlIghted by great 
defense bv both teams (or 
maybe great ineptness? ). Most 
of the first hal f was spent 
equally on both team's five-
yard line. but because of the 
stoutnes of such scrummies as 
Don " the Hulk " Reordan. 
Jaguar Mic ((he team's 
hookerl. Butterball Bill Gates 
and Peter " the man 
Waasdorp. Loyola didn't stand 
a chance of scoring . 

. The man ". besides playing 
a great defenSive game. could 
not be contained on offense. as 
he beer· barrelled hiS way over 
the touchline for what 'might 
have been the fIrst score of his 
career But. alas. there was a 
whistle to nulllfl' It. (Oh well . 
better luck next lIme l. 

But even WIth all thiS great 
playmg by our heroes. we wer 
down 3-0 as the econd half 
began. WIth the start of the 
second half. Dick Duncan 
finally realized the game had 
started and trotted down the 
field for the only try of the 

game. And with Peter "over 
the hill " Sertic 's kick the game 
was 6-3 in favor of UCSD. 

With a little breathing room 
now, our ruggers played their 
hearts out as they bottled up 
the Loyola runners. There was 
only one problem : Loyola 
bottled up ou r runners too. So 
the remainder of the game was 
spent in vicious scrum battles 
and leaping contests between 
Kangaroo Beanan and their 
answer to Wilt the Sti lt. The 
game was almost thrown into 
overtime as another rugger 
wa called for head hunting 
(c·mon. guys. if not butterflies. 
how about stamps?), and 
Loyola was awarded a penalty 
kick. But as luck and lessons 
from Bill Gates would have it. 
his kick was " a bit" off . This 
was the last threat to either 
team and the game ended 
UCSD 6 and Loyola 3. 

The UCSD II team also found 
action last weekend. probably 
more than they wanted , as they 
met a bone-crushing 33-3 defeat 
at the hands of our "always 
good for a game" UDT-Seal 
team. Our only points came 
from a penalty kick by Skip. 
while two of our newer ruggers 
were initiated into the game. 
One received a broken bender 
hand and the other a busted bob 
collar bone. The loss of these 
two meats will hurt the 
strength of the UCSD II team. 

Yel. this weekend both teams 
Will fmd action as the UCSD I' s 
travel to Pasadena to frolic 
With the smog and Ca l Tech, 
and the JI 's host Indian RC. 
ThIS IS our last "away" game, 
so this is the last chance for all 
those who want a free trip to 
the armpit of Cali fornia. 

case, he will undoubtedly emerge as a superstar. David Wright 
and Jon "Frenchy" LeLevier were also able to put a few down 
on the chumps from Davis as they threw in 13 apiece. 

The Triton cause was hampered, however, by the loss of 
guard Dave Gregory . who saw his entire front tooth go flying 
across the floor after receiving an elbow from one of the 
cowboys. Typically, Dave was called for the foul as the homer 
job was worked to perfection. 

The Tritons took out their frustration on Sonoma State 
Monday night with an exhilirating 76-~1 victory. Defense again 
was the deciding factor , with Sonoma displaying virtually none 
of it and UCSD playing tenaciously and well . The card game at 
the Motel Alto in Mill Valley after the game was reputed to be 
a rare affair. Fuqua and Neuf ended up " in their eye" while the 
Roadrunner was rumored to have dropped a few big bills. 

The Tritons entertain Southern Cal College and Cal State 
Bakersfield this weekend with the sec game tonight at 8 p.m. 
and the Cal State game tomorrow night at the same time. 

Both games will be preceded by performances by UCSD's 
Blackhawks. On Friday the game starts at 5 : 4~ and will feature 
as opponents the Southeast San Diego YMCA "Judges." On 
Saturday, in a move to promote conformity, the game also 
starts at 5 : 4~ , and the opposing forces will consist of famous 
rubber-bam team of yesteryear. 

Exciting action is in store for those of you who are 
experiencing the malaise that comes with midterms. See you 
at the games. 

Bog Paul Trainer puts up two in game against Cbico State last 
Friday which the Tritons lost, 72-'5.

Tritons trounce 
Azusa-Pacific 

The powerful Triton wrestlers flexed their muscles last 
Thursday nite as they trounced Azusa-Pacific by a score of 51-
O. The grapplers accounted for seven "pi ns" and three 
decisions (the " pins" included three fo rfeited matches ) on 
their way to racking up their third meet without a loss. The 
lCSD mat men were led by John Hayes , Leroy McNair, Curtis 
Tome, and big man John State, each pinning his opponent 
handi ly. 

After the match, the spectators I mostly Azusa-Pacific fa ns, 
ironically) were treated to an exhibition wrestling meet 
featuring John Knapp, Randy Ziegler, Jorge Correa. John P. 
Gressard and assistant coach Bob Wilson. as they showed their 
skills on the mat against somewhat tougher " foes ." 

The next meet will be Thursday. Feb. 3, against Pasadena 
City College in Pasadena. (Yup, you 're right. that was 
yesterday .) The next meet will be agai nst powerful USIU, 
sometime next week at USIU . That's it for the wrestling world 
th is time, kidd ies . 

Program on Black 
athletes scheduled 

Next Wed nesday. Feb. 9. the black students of UCSD in 
conjunction with the UCSD PE Department will present the 
ftrst in a series of workshops : "The Black Athlete : A New 
Image." 

The workshop, which will begin at 6 p.m. in the Humanties

amateur athletes : coaches ; school administrators; students, 
newsmen ; recrea tion specialists' counselors and teachers. 

Discus ion of relevant issues must be thoroughl y aired by

Golf article termed inaccurate 
Dear Sir : 

I would like to call your 
attention to page SIX of your 
Feb. 1 issue. where you will 
find an article entitled "The 
Power Elite of Golfdom" by a 
certain Rocky Halfon. 

I would like to help you 
realize that this is a poor 
art icle. It was intended , I 
believe. as an account of the 
San Diego Open. Unfortunately 
the nitwit who wrote the 
goddam piece wrote an 
EDITORIAL instead of an 
article. 

His artic le begins. you will 
note . with a 110-word 
paragraph composed of 
bullshil. 

He then devotes 110 words to 
the San Diego Open in general. 

He follows with a 300-word 
account of his experiences in 
the 1968 Pro-Am, as a caddy. 
(In case the fact has slipped 
your mind. as it slipped the 
mind of Mr Halfon . this was an 
account of the 1972 golf 
tournament at Torrey Pines! 

He follows with 180 words on 
"my Income tax and C. Write 
Mills (sic I". and concludes 
with a big 40 words on the 1972 
Open Every statement he 
makes about this event is 
erroneous. To quote : 

" ... the fellow who won last 
Sunday is only a part·time pro_ 
He comes out onlv when the 
sun IS out . Ho Hum .-" 

Paul Harney was a full-time 
touring pro for 10 years before 
he se ttled down in 
Massachusetts in a club job 
which. naturally. only lets him 
tour during the winter. He is of 
course a full ·time pro If Mr. 
Halfon had been present dUring 
the first round of play he would 
also have noted that it was so 

cold Lee Trevino made a slink 
about it in the papers. !The 
newspapers, the ones whIch 
covered the event.) 

In sun, Mr. Harney is not a 
part-time pro. he does not 
come out only when the sun is 
shining, and the sun was not 
shining. 

Mr. Halfon also spends 300 
words bitching about the 
" fact" that he got paid $\0 for 
"carrying (some doctor 's) bag 
for eight hours. " This is not 
true . Mr . Halfon spent 
somewhere between three and 
five hours dlcking around the 
clubhouse waiting for someone 
to show up and hire him. He 
actually worked about four and 
a half hours, at a rate over two 
dollars per hour. For unskilled 
labor. this is not precisely 
tragic . 

Finally . let us broach the 
central 'thesis of Mr. Halfon 's 
editorial He says, "For those 
who don 't know. AWSDO 
stands for All Wasp Sport for 
Demagogues Only." 

As usual. Mr. Halfon is 
Halfaccurate. It js Singularly 
unfortunate that he couldn 't 
have found a word to make 
se nse wh ere he used 
"demagogues," which makes 
none . !Duffers? Dimwits? 
DIl et t antes? Dildos ? 
Demigo ds?) But . more 
important than his lack of wit 
or his unerring sense of 
maccuracv. he asserts that 
everyone playing out there was 
a Wasp. and was the son of a La 
Jolla doctor. or some such 
garbage. His as ertion is that 
those who have bundles of 
money play pro golf and win

An Experience 
of 

The only concept I ever halfway understood 
In high school mathematics was that of the 
fulcrum - I was intrigued with the notion of 
moving the seesaw back and forth in order to 
balance the entire arrangement. I experienced 
this sense of equalizatIOn once again when I 
learned how to drive a stick shift automobile : 
accelerate - clutch . brake - deccelerate . 
clutch. My most recent experience with 
balance was 10 vieWing Sam Peckinpah 's 
"Straw Dogs." 

"Straw Dogs". whether due to Peckinpah 's 
request or the prerogative exercised by the 
theatre-owner. has an Intermission during a 
very tense moment of the film . Since the film 
IS only about an hour and forty minutes long, I 
was rather surprised at the inclusion of the 
intermission. but . as I saw the whole him 
unfold. r realized why the theatre had placed 
the intermission In the film to heighten 
Peckmpah 's perfectlv balanced filmiC line 
Before the IntermiSSion. the viewer IS acutel v

presumably inherited from her father . The 
house is in an isolated part of a small , obscure, 
Scottish village, a village replete with its 
bullies and its saviors. 

The content of "Straw Dogs" has been 
discussed in the editorial sections of various 
newspapers. the features departments , and 
even the ladies' sections of many publications. 
The subject of contention was a rape scene 
that some people felt was too graphic for a 
him . that others hold to be a reinforcement of 
the concept that rape is entirely the woman 's 
fault. and that I maintain is Peckinpah 's 
CYnical view of the fashion people use others 
to achieve revenge against certa in people. 
Clea rly, Susan George in her role as Amy 
Sumner was a seductive looking young woman 
whose unashamedness about her body left 
some men hoping to get In Dust in Hoffman 's 
bed [interpreted the rape scene as the wife 's

game better than most men - she cuckolded

The gnsllness of the clOSing scenes of 
"Straw Dogs" need not be reiterated here 
The directIOn IS nothing short of incredible as 
the tension mounts and as David Sumner. now

five men who have become the symbol of

but doubtlessly a better nowhere than the 
somewhere they have just been.

"Its not what I say 
v 

.. it's what I mean" 
"Men don't understand they shouldn 't listen 

to what I say- they should listen to what I 
mean!" So protests the flashy Lydia , 
maintaining that men should see past her 
black body stocking and red hot pants to the 
fragile lyric poetry of her sensitive soul. 
Bernard, by contrast, is clean-cut, naive and 
lovable. and wants desperately to be a part of 
the hip in-group. "What I wouldn 't give to be a 
nonconformist like all those others ," he 
yearns. And there is the he-man Huey and a 
Ruth Buzzy type who can find no takers for ber 
frenetic "innocent love." 

Followers of Jules Feiffer will recognize 
these cartoon characters, and many others , 
who are currently being projected on the stage 
in a revue entitled " Feiffer's People" at the 
Old Globe Theater 's Cassius Carter Center 
Stage. Although it has been produced before on 
Broadway and elsewhere. Charles Vernon of 
the USIU School of Performing Arts has 
adapted and updated this eries of sketches in 
" Iaugh·in" style. He has added, for example, 
one of the most successful episodes of the lot. 
" Manly Woman vs . Hostile Man." as well as a 
poke at the University of California , and 
included original lyrics by Wayne Smith and 
Gloria Brendle. 

Some of Feiffer's many targets for satire 
include the U.S. Army (" we marched to and 
from the church of our choice thi s morning," 
Bernard writes his mother ), hippies. the 
bomb, Superman (sexually suspect in hiS 
skintight leotards)' and the movie star (John 
Wayne) who runs for office on his past 
political record from roles in WWII films . 

"The attempt has been to stress Feiffer 's 
freewheeling humor , to make him 
lighthearted and gay with a sense of the 
ridiculous without destroying the bite," says 
Vernon, who sees him ' as a "frustrated 
romantic ." While this may be true of the 
political gibes. the Jewish mother and 

Christmas season humor, a bleak vision of 
sexual relationships intrudes to offer a 
disturbing note . Here the laughter is uneasy 
and cold , for sex is always coarse and only 
really fun when it 's understood to be dirty. 
This is the Jules Feiffer of Carnal Knowledge, 
not the cartoonist of the " New Republic" and 
" Village Voice." 

Vernon has exploited the Cassius Carter 
Center Stage, a charming, intimate theater in 
the round. to its fullest advantage. All four of 
the aisles and the spotlight pivots at the top 01 
them are used by the uncountable characters 
who come and go at a fast pace. The small 
center stage is cleverly designed of black and 
white cubes, recalling a chess board, several 
of which open to reveal props- a typewriter . a 
telephone. The basic costumes carry out this 
two·dimensional theme : the girls are all in 
black, the men in white . 

The cast of seven. all drama students from 
USIU or San Diego State with the exception of 
Wayne Smith. performs with energy and 
enthusiasm. Three I found particularly good : 
Julie Kavner. David Russell Leisure, and 
Wayne Smith . Together with Lee Murphy. 
Michael Weil. Kathy Arntzen, and Michael 
Hall . they work well as a unit. 

Although some of the material has been 
revised to bring it into the seventies, the result 
is more a retrospective show of the past ten 
years of Feiffer than an up·!o-{late , topical 
revue. There is , at best, more nostalgia than 
hilarity. Perhaps one of the reasons for this IS 
the inherent difficulty of dramatizing the 
comic strip. We read rapidly, giving the punch 
line the chance to surprise us , but on the stage 
we recognize in advance as a cliche. The 
laughter is thus programmed rather than 
spontaneous, and often it is reduced to a smile. 
"Feiffer's People" does, however, provide a 
diverting evening of entertainment. 
Performances are scheduled through Feb. 13.

The hype says. "Traffic Is Back." I don 't 
know where they went. but I can say that if 
they did go away, then they are indeed 
"Back." Steve Win wood, leader of Traffic. 
produced "Low Spark," and the music is much 
in the style of "John Barleycorn Must Die." 
Quite a bit of the music is very jazzy. due 
mostly to Chris Wood's sax and flute playing. 
But the group hasn't lost its talent for putting 
together good rock'n' roll. 

"Low Spark" is Traffic 's first LP on the 
Island label which is distributed in this 
country by Capitol Records. Having met their 
contractual agreements with United Artists 
amid a din of hassles, Winwood changed over 
to Island . The personnel on "Low Spark" 
remains unchanged from that on "Welcome 10 

TRAFFIC 

Spark" are Rick Grecb on bass, Jim GordoD 
on drums. Jim Capaldi on organ and 
percussion, Chris Wood playing sax, flute, 
piano and organ. " Reebop" Kwabu Baab on 
congas, bongos and timbales. Winwood plays 
guitar , organ and piano, and sings some sweel 
vocals. 

Collectively, the whole album is quite good 
and hangs together very well . There are some 
high spots . The title track, which takes up 
twelve minutes on side one, is a jazz tune on 
which Chris Wood on sax and Winwood on 
piano collaborate to lay down some very tasty 
licks. Pick just about any instrument and 
Winwood can probably play it well and with a 
very high level of creativity. "Rock & Roll 
Stew", which was written by Grech and 

Tr 10 " <fl(;' k d high h€'eled boy~ 

the Canteen," their last release on UA . With 
the exception of Dave Mason who left the 
group to record and perform on his own. but 
did play with them at the Oz Ben fit Concert 
from whIch " Welcome to the Canteen" was 
taken 

Winwood is still the drIVing force behind 
TraffiC. HaVing begun In the music business 
With the Spencer Davis Group at the age of 18, 
his mUSical ability and talent for creativity 
became well known very fa st. HIS own album , 
" Winwood " /United Artists·UAS 9950 ), which 
is now a collector's item because of his lawsuit 
agamst UA (who was subsequently forced to 
remove the album from the stores), attests to 
his abilities as a musician. With him on " Low 

Gordon , IS mUSIC with a beal. Reebop keeps It 
together with his timbales while Winwood 
again stands out. but thi s time on guitar 
"Many a Mile 10 Freedom" exhibits just how 
pleasing Traffic can be to listen to. Winwood 's 
vocals are great. he has an excellent voice; 
and his guitar leads are well executed . ChrIS 
Wood 's flute gives the tune a haunting sort of 
feelIng . 

"The Low Spark of Higb Heeled Boys" is a 
good album. That's a very simple way of 
putting it, but it's a fact. I've liked listening to 
Traffic for a long time, and whether or not 
you're a Traffic fan , if you like creative and 
well-performed music, you will not be 
disappointed.
