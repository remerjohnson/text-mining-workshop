Atkinson Warns Faculty of Budget Cuts 
.• In speech to faculty, chancellor also praises UCSD's academic record 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Staff Writer 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson presented 
his annual campus update to members of the 
Representative Assembly of the Academic 
Senate on Tuesday, emphasizing the expected 
effects of budget cuts for next year. 

Atkinson told Academic Senate members 
thatthe state's University of Califomia (UC) 
operating budget for 1990-91 , which requires 
a seven percent increase to maintain the cur-
rent level of programs, was assigned an in-
crease of only two percent from last year's 
budget. 

As a result, the UC system will experience 
a five percent cut in funding for research, 
public service, and institutional support. At 
UCSD, the cut will reflect a $1.8 million loss 
in revenue. 

"[The mandated cut] is going to put tre-
mendous pressure on the University of Cali-
fornia and particular pressure on the campus," 
Atkinson said, noting that the already rela-
tively small UCSD administrative depart-

ment will probably face severe problems re-
sulting from the reduced budget. 

Atkinson also warned that the university 
may undergo further budget cuts next year, 
and that "it 's possible that next year's budget 
will be worse." 

In addition, the recent failure of Proposi-
tion 143 - which would have given 
California's state-funded colleges $450 mil-
lion - also results in a fiscal setback for the 
university. 

'The defeat of Prop. 143 isarealdisaster," 
Atkinson said. "How our priorities will shift 
and change is not yet decided. " 

According to Atkin on, the defeat of the 
proposition will affect roughly 100 capital 
projects, such as the construction of planned 
academic facilities. 

On a more positive note, Atkinson re-
ported a slight increase in outside funding -
support from governmental agencies and pri-
vate donations. UCSD ranked third in the UC 
system, behind the Los Angeles and Berkeley

Atkinson's RIMAe Decision Gets Mixed Reactions 
• Committee chair is "disappointed," while Edson applauds chancellor 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Staff Writer 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson's decision 
last week to continue with the current plans 
for the Recreational/lntramural/ Athletics and 
Events Center (RIMAC) has been received 
with mixed reactions. 

While Associated Students President John 
Edson expressed reliefconcemingAtkinson' s 
decision, Dr. Frieder Seible, chairman of the 
Academic Senate's Committee on Campus 
and Community Environment, described the 
feelings of the Academic Senate as "disap-
pointed." 

The chancellor's decision follows a reso-
lution submitted by the Academic Senate 
which requests that certain structural changes, 
including a reduction in the facility's size, be 
considered due to concem that the structure 
may have a negati ve affect on other academic 
facilities. 

"I think that [Atkinson] did the right thing," 
Edson said. 

Edson had earlier sent a letter to Atkinson 
urging him not to consider the Academic 
Senate resolution, on the basis ~t it tampers 

with - and, if accepted, would nUllify - the 
Spring 1990 RIMAC referendum, which has 
been approved by both the students and the 
chancellor. 

Edson called the resolution "unprecedented 
and inappropriate involvement of the Aca-
demic Senate in the planning and program-
matic control over student-fee funded facili-
ties." 

In explaining the intention behind its 
resolution, Seible emphasized the Academic 
Senate's opposition to the events component 
- which allows the RIMAC facility to be 
used for non-athletic events until a permanent 
events facility is built east of Interstate 5. 

"We are very disappointed with the 
chancellor's decision. 1 still think we would 
be much better without the events arena," 
Seible stated. 

However. he consented, "I think that the 
chancellor did the only thing he could legally 
do." 

Seible indicated that the Academic Senate 
would not be satisfied with RIMAC until the 
separate events facility is constructed. 

The A.S., although "happy that Atkinson 

rejected the Academic Senate re olution, still 
wants our grievances looked at," Edson said, 
referring to questions that the A.S. had raised 
regarding voting procedure and the possibil-
ity of biased voting information for last 
winter's RIMAC referendum. 

In October, the A.S. passed a resolution 
asking Atkinson to look into their grievances. 

In response, "[Atkinson] told me specifi-
cally that he read the grievances and was not 
willing to meet on them. He said that he didn't 
care if it was brought up to the regents, or to 
a court outside of the [UC] sy tern," Edson 
explained. 

As a result of the controversy urrounding 
the voting on the RIMAC referendum, the 
University of California Students Associa-
tion (UCSA) i working on a propo 'al which 
will clarify the i ue of the control of the 
voting and the control of the facility, should 
similar ituations arise in the future regarding 
tucient-fee funded facHitie ' among the UC 
ystem. 

"Any question about grievances will be 
addressed in the UCSA proposal," Edson 
concluded.

Psychologist Finds Link Between 
Music Perception and Speech 

How a person hears music may be influenced by hi s or 
her language or dialect, according to Diana Deutsch, 
professor of Psychology here at UCSD. Deutsch recently 
completed research which shows that people who grew up 
in California and people from the south of England 
perceive the identical musical pattern in opposite ways. 

Recognized as one of the country's top authorities on 
musical perception, Deutsch, who delivered her findi ngs 
at aNov . 29 meeting in San Diego, is the first researcher 
in the field to establish a direct relationship between music 
perception and the production of speech and language. 

Her research inel uded two studies: one that revealed a 
correlation between the way a musical pauem was per· 
ceived and the pitch rangeofLhe listener' speaking voice; 
and one that exantined how two groups of listeners - 24 
fromCalifomiaand 1 2 from southem England-perceived 
musical pallems. 

According to Deutsch, when most of the Californians 
heard a musical pattern as ascending, the English heard it 
as descending. And conversely, when the Californians 
heard the pattern as descending, the English heard it as 
ascending. 

'The pattern, together with its properties, is known as 
the tritone paradox . Two specially synthesized tones are 
presented in succession, which are related by a half· 
octave, or tritone.. . !hi pattern bas two paradoxical 
properties. First , for any given listener it is heard as 
ascending when played in one key, but as descending 
when played in a different key. Second, when the pattern 
is pll!yed in one key, it is heard as ascending by some 
listeners but as descending by others," Deutsch said. 

In previous work., Deutsch has created other musical 
illusions which are heard quite differently by different 

liste~rs. For example, she has found that these differ· 
ences can be related to whether the listeners are left-
handed or right-handed, indicating that such differences 
are biological in origin.

Her most recent findings show that striking differences in 
a listener's perception, which are based on cultural factors, 
can also exist. 

UCSD Scientists Link Breast Cancer 
Mortality Rates to Solar Exposure 

Scientists here at UCSD have linked breast cancer death 
rates in specific geographic areas of the United States to levels 
of daily sunlight exposure in those areas. They have discov-
ered that areas receiving high levels of ultraviolet sunlight 
have lower mortality rates for breast cancer. 

In a paper that appeared in the Nov. 13 issue of Prevelllive 
Medicine, the UCSD researchers said that Vitamin D from 
sunlight exposure may be associated with low risk of breast 
cancer mortality, and that the difference in ultraviolet light 
reaching the U .S. population may account for striking regional 
differences in breast cancer death rates. 

Exposure to sunlight accounts for approximately 75 per-
cent of the vitamin D in the lxxly, and researchers think 
adequate blood levels of vitamin D may protect women 
against breast cancer. 

Vitamin D deficiency has previously been Linked to in-
creased risk for colon cancer by research.ers at UCSD and 
John Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. In 
general, populations found to be at high risk for colon cancer 
are also at high risk for breast cancer, and conversely, those at 
low risk for colon cancer are at low risk for breast cancer. 

Researchers said that geographic differences in breast 
cancer death rates found in the study were probably related 10 
sunlight exposure rather than to amounts of vitamin D con-
sumed, as vitamin D is relatively uncommon in the diets of 
U.S . adults. The most common source of vi tamin Dis fortified 
milk, whiCh most adults in the U.S. do not consume. 

Dr. Cedric Garland, associate professor of Community 
andFamily Medicineat UCSD, noted that the study should 001 
be interpreted as a recommendation to take Jarge supplements 
of vitamin D, as the vitamin can be toxic in high doses. 

Rather, he suggests that people increase theirconsumption 
of milk and foods rich in vitamin D. . 

"Fortified milk. products and surface dwelling fish, for 
example tuna and salmon, are good sources," Garland said. 

He also said there must be a balance between excessive sun 
exposure, which can increase the risk of skin cancer, an9- the 
amount of exposure needed for the lxxly to produce adequate 
levels of vitamin D in the skin. 

"In Southern California, about 10 minutes per day of 
exposure without sunscreen in enough; in New York City, 15 
minutes are needed because of the difference in latitude," he 
said 

.Weather outlook: 

Expect extreme high and low tides due to a 
rare proxigee. A proxigee is when the Earth 
lines up with the sun and the moon, with the 
moon at its nearest distance to the Earth. 

Average temperature for sea/air 
is 61 degrees.

New Third, Revelle College Requirement 
Changes Approved by Academic Senate 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Staff Writer 

Following recommendations by 
the Senate's Committee on Educa-
tional Policy (CEP), the Represen-
tative Assembly of the Academic 
Senate approved the proposed 
changes to the general education 
requirements of Third and Revelle 
Colleges. 

The renovated Third College 
general education requirements 
center on the consolidation of the 
current writing and societal analysis 
courses into the a "diversity ,justice, 
and imagination" series. Revelle 
College will introduce an "Ameri-
cancultures" componentto i ts three-
course social science requirement, 
prompted by a CEP suggestion that 
colJege general education require-
ments include the study of ethnic 
groups. 

'The new requirements, which 
will take effect during Fall Quarter 
1991 for entering fre~hmen and Fall 
Quarter 1994 for transfer students, 
will reflect a complete revision of 
Third's requirements, and a change 
of only one class at Revelle . 

'The new Third College series 
consists of one four-unit class and 
two six-unit classes which. offer in-

tensive writing. These core courses 
are deSigned to create a "common 
experience among Third students," 
according to Third College Provost 
Cecil Lytle. 

Another principal c hange in the 
Third College requirements is the 
replacement of the three non-con-
tiguous upper-division courses by 

the four-course "disciplinary 
breadth" component. 

The courses, which must be non-
contiguous to the student's major, 
must include one writing-intensive 
class, and two upper-division 
classes.

COMMENTARY 

1990: The Year of the War Pigs 
• In spite of all the flag-waving and rhetoric, Americans should fear a war in the Gulf 
By Jeff Pitman 
Politicians hide themselves 
away 
They only started the war 
Why should they go out to fight? 
They leave that up to the poor 

- Black Sabbath, War Pigs 

Ozzy Osbourne, that horrible 
demon, wrote these words 20 years 
ago, while watching the sacrificial 
offering of 50,000 lambs for the 
slaughter in Vietnam. Ironically, 
Faith No More chose this year to 
release an albwn covering the song: 
A testament to the sad truth that 
hwnans are really stupid, brutal 
creatures, no more capable of self· 
preservation or learning from mis· 
takes than the dumbheaded bena 
fish that, seeing a r~flection of it-
self in a mirror, promptly beats 
itself to death. 

So war pigs are back in style. 
And as we speak they are crawling 
out of the muck they've been wal· 
lowing in for so long, shaking their 
fists and waving flags; a parade led 
by the dim· witted yet exalted Por-
cine Commander himself, George 
Bush. 

was on 

Arabia four months ago, ready to 
ovemm it as he did Kuw~t. Sup-
posedly to prevent this, we sent in 

been under tremendous pressure, 
for he is still having to prove daily 
that he is no longer a wimp. 

So, despite his incredible in-
competence, I guess you still have 
to feel sorry for the poor bastard. 

There he was, plugging away 
for eight years, in the supporting 
actor role. Sure, from time to time 
he'd fly off to some foreign funer-
als, but mostly he was stuck 
watching his brain-dead boss par-
rot a few choice phrases for the 
cameras, sending the ignorant 
masses into fervent patriotic fits. 

"Oh, if only that were me," 
George thought wistfully. 

It must have been torture, after 
losing to Reagan in the '80 prima-
ries, to be forced to see the senile 
oldman bumble througheighl years 
of gaffes and indictments, refusing 
to die from assassin's bullets and 
various cancers, while inexplica· 

bly inspiring the undying love and 
support of the frothing throngs. 

But, somehow, Bush weathered 
the tempest, carefully concealed 
his record as CrA chief, and wan-
dered into the spotlight as succes-
sor to the throne in '88. The heir 
apparent, King George IV. 

"Man, this is gonna be great," 
he thought at first. "I'll sleep 
through a few cabinet meetings, 
parade the family pets out for the 
press, sprinkle some sound bites in 
for good measure, then lie back 
and let the accolades roll in." 

So Hussein's invasion of Ku· 
wait must have come as a nasty 
shock. 

Or was it a welcome one? 
After all that talk last summer 

about defense cutbacks and the 
"peace dividend," maybe the Iraqi 
invasion was exactly the godsend 
George had been looking for. 

Those dry months of June and 
July must have sucked. Every 
morning George would be rudely 
awakened at 0400 by a phone call 
from some surly, mouth-breathing 
Pentagon thug , screaming, 
"Goddammit, sir! Congress is go-
ing to start cutting into my pension 
plan soon! If you're not going to do 
something about this, maybe we' ll 
have to go start some action on our 
own!" 

No wonder George jumped into 
action , mobilizing every man , 
woman, tank, warship, fighter, and 
Swiss Anny knife available before 
the rest of the world even had a 
chance to figure out where the hell 
Kuwait was . 

Old George must have been 
pissing his pants in glee when 
Saddam Hussein thundered his 
tanks into that sandy little hellhole. 
Bush sure seemed to be grinning 

about something as he s trolled 
around the golf course and fi shed 
offhis yacht during those first few 
weeks of the crisis. 

At first , George did seem to 
mistake it for another one o f those 
Panama deals: toss a few thousand 
troops at it, and it ' ll go away. 

But then the whole thing just 
':>Iew up in Bush's face , like your 
average Acme product in the hands 
of Wile E. Coyote. 

All of a sudden, Bush 's polls 
were plummeting, o il prices were 
spurting up, and the whole world 
seemed to have launched into the 
ad- lib phase, abandoning the 
Reagan script entirely. Which -
being an oil man - Bush saw as at 
least one good thing out of three. 

Still , he was stuck with the other 
two. Damn, he thought. This isn ' t 
what was supposed to happen!

UCSD BOOKSTORE~) 
ANNUAL . So what is Bush doing? Goo<! 

question. 
Apparently nobody knows, 

from the soldiers mired in the sand 
to the Great Liar himself (which, 
since h\s predecessor was the Great 
Communicator, would be !lush). 

One day we hear, "We must not 
allow naked aggression." The next 
it's, "But let us get our troops over 
there first, and perhaps curry a little 
Arab favor in the process." 

Sudderuycomes, "Give up now I 
Baghdad will be rubble!" followed 
swiftly by, "Once, of course, we 
can get some other countries to 
back us up, first." 

As a generous Thanksgiving 
gift, the troops are told, "Don't 
worry, you'll get your chance to go 
in and do what you came here for 
soon enough."Everyoneelse hears, 
.. Assuming, naturally, that the Se-
curity Council gives us a strong 
vote of confidence." 

Whi£h is all well and good. The 
only problem is at least until the 
White House grudgingly goes 
ahead and seeks the approval of 
Congress and the U.N., half a mil-
lion (and probably more) Ameri· 
cans lives lie prey to the whims of 
George Herbert Walker Bush, who, 
as Swine- in-Chief, can do with 
them as he damn well pleases. 

And, as he so masterfully dem-
onstrated with his amazingly acro-
batic position changes during the 
recent budget squabble, not even 
the King Pig himself has any idea 
wbat the hell that is. 

Call me crazy, but why do I get 
the impression that this guy has 
been flipping his lucky penny for 
every major governmental deci· 
sion he's made so far? True, he has

Continued from page 5 
What am [ supposed to do now? 

Well, for a while he heeded the 
advice of the sane portion of the 
globe, and waited for the economic 
sanctions against Iraq to take ef-
fect (at least until his U.N. goons 
blackmailed a "do or die" deadline 
out of the other Security Council 
members). 

He could, of course, opt for the 
humane alternative to war, fly over 
to Baghdad, and simply er.gage in 
a fistfight with Saddam over Ku-
wait. (George would probably lose, 
of course, which may explain why 
this hasn't happened yet.) 

But alas, George Bush remains 
a pig-headed fool - but not a 
wimp, damnit! - who is unable to 
face up to reality. Obviously, he 
willonJy withdraw his troops when 
they're in body bags (pawns can't 
move backward), so his only other 

option is war. Which, if we're go-
ing to disprove all the prophets and 
actually live to see the next century, 
is not an option. 

In all his "macho" bravado, 
dangling the giant carrot of a U.S. 
military offensive in front of 
Saddam's face, Bush seems to have 
implanted his head firmly up his 
ass. If he's having so many prob-
lems getting our supposed "allies" 
to allow him to kill off half a mil-
lion of his own soldiers, when does 
he think everyone else is going to 
start blithely tossing their young 
people into the carnage - or does 
he care? 

Margaret Thatcher wanted no 
part of it. Seeing the mess Bush 
had gotten her into, and sensing 
her own party's misgivings, she 
promptly abandoned her 11 years 
of bludgeoning the British people 
with an iron fist, allowing some 
other stooge to take the fall for 
what lies ahead.

And in what is perhaps Bush's 
most grievious miscalculation, he 
seems to be completely blind to 
just how important the brother-
hood of Islam is to the Arab 
countries who , nervous that 
Saddarn may have had designs on 
their land, have grudgingly toler-
ated Bush's blustering thus far. 

But already the Saudis are 
growing weary of the sight of us, 
and are hoping to get our troops off 
their soil as soon as possible, before 
our corrupting presence inspires 
any more of their women to drive 
cars (although that act has now 
been officially made illegal). 

And iffora moment you thought 
that Iran, Syria, Jordan, or Egypt 
harbored any great love for us (es-
pecially considering the tons of 
arms and money we pour into Is-
rael), think again. 

No, the Iranians haven 't been

But if U.S. forces ever start

ing desire 10 launch a strike on 
Baghdad all the more frightening, 
especially if it is jusl American 
(and perhaps British) forces doing 
the shooting. 

Maybe we can hold our own, 
turning only a few hundred thou-
sand of our troops into cadavers 
against Iraq alone, but if any of 
these Arab countries switch sides, 
we will be buried up to our necks in 
the sands. Over our heads, even. 

George Bush is happily danc-
ing over a minefield, a scary 
thought when you realize what an 
utter buffoon he is. 

Then again, the prospect of 
President Quayle being only six 
yt:ars away should cheer you right 
up.

He also noted an increase in fresh-

man retention rates from 80 percent in 
1982 to 92 percent in 1989. 

Atkinson had praise for the gradu-

the absence of state funding.

According to Finnecy, no 
convenient method was found to 
alert the entire student body of the 
new policy, which went into ef-
fect during the summer of 1990. 

"It's very difficult with the 
kind of public we serve to an-
nounce anything to everybody," 
he said. 

thus were not sent notification 
leners, Finnecy added. 

The new policy evolved from 
a 1989 plan to extend enforce-
ment at the meters until II p.m. 
That regUlation was printed on 
the back of UCSD parking per-
mits. 

For one reason or another, 
however, students were not 
reading the back of their permits 
and were getting ticketed often, 
Finnecy said. 

Because of the excessive 
Faculty members were not ticketing, parking officials re-

given preferential treatment and versed the earlier decision.

ERRATA 
Some incorrect statements were 

made in the article "Sludcnt Artist 
Sets Out in Search of Her Stolen 
Fruit of Delight" in the Nov. 14 is-
sue of the GUiJrdian. 

The article slated that Andrea 
Leigh was the first student allist to 
have her work displaye(\ in the Price 
Center. In fact, she is the first under-
graduate anist 10 have her art on 
long· term disi'!ay. 

TIle name of some of Leigh's 
other works were incorrect. Her 
pieces are titled Grand Mother, 
Madame BUlfeTjly, and Whine. They 
will be displayed at a reception on 
the 10th floor of Symphony Towers 
in downtown San Diego on Dec. 7. 

A reward is being offered for 
infonnation leading to the recovery 
of Leigh's work. Leigh can be con-
tacted at 270-2977. 

In the anicle"FifthColi ege l'I ans 
to Find a Name by Spring of 1992" 
in the Nov. 12 issue of the GUiJrd-
ian, itwas erroneously reported that 
students, staff, and faculty of Fifth 
College would receive a packet of 
materials in the mail regarding the 
naming process. In fact, the mate-
rial and fonns can be picked up in 
the Fifth College Provost's Office 
or the Fifth College Resident Life 
Office. 

The Guardian regrets the errors.

• A glimpse at the 
history of dance 
By John Steckert 
Staff Writer 

They are story tellers, but say not a word. 
They are the creators of art, but paint not a 
stroke. Their canvas is the stage and it is through 
their movements tJlat they express themselves. 
They are the inheritors of a great and long tradition as 
old as mankind itself. They are the dancers. 

The art of dancing has its roots embedded wjthin 
the development of prehistoric humans. As they began 
to gain an awareness of the forces of nature around 
themselves, humans looked for new ways 10 apPease 
these forces and bring themselves into their favor. 
'They turned to their bodies 10 accomplish this, using 
movements as a 100110 COIlvey thoughts and emotions. 
It was in this form that dance first appeared. 

Emphasizing rhythm, the primitive dances, 
according to Agnes De Mille, author of The Book of 
Dance, consisted mainly of stamping movements 
while crouching in imitation of animals. There was 
little or no contact with others, with the dancers 
contributing their own styles. 

Dance later became less dependent on the use of 
rhythm and concentrated more on the pleasure 
obIained through visual beauty. Clenched tists were 
now opened, and fingers sculpted the air.in graceful 
gestures. Simple stamping became lost 10 techniques 
of leaping and gliding while the once singular drum

• Dance clubs offer 
grooves, music, 
and escape 
By Gavin Christy 
Staff Writer 

It's Friday night , the evil work and 
school week are over, and you want to blow 

off some steam and have some fun. Knowing 
that dinner and a movie won't satisfy your 

restless need to lose your inhibitions and go crazy, 
you opt for an excursion to your favorite dance club. 

While each dance club is different from the others. 
there are some similarities among all of them. The 
lights are dim, the music is loud, the bartenders are 
busy. Numerous energetic men and women are in the 
mood to meet one another and share some space on 
the dance floor bumping, grinding, gyrating, stomp-
ing, and twirling the night away. 

Senior Terry Allen speculated that "dance clubs are 
places to escape and let go of your inhibitions." 

Allen added that being in a crowd of people on the 
dance floor facilitates lhe ability to express yourself 
freeJy. 

''1be atmosphere helps the idea of losing yourself 
and being anonymous. [Dance clubs] are different 
from any daytime experience," Allen said. 

Pan of the attraction of dance clubs is the allure of 
the music itself. Granted, the music may be loud and 
fast, but it may also be therapeutic. 

"More evidence is accumulating each year to 
support the contention that music may be one of 

the most powerful forces to affect mankind," 
stated Arthur Harvey, executive director of 

the Music for Health Services Foundation.

DANCE 
Continued from page 9 

This fascination with visual beauty led 
traditional dancing slightly away from its 
original purpose and more towardsaniche 
in the field of entertainment. According to 
De Mille. the first professional dancer 
appeared in ancient Egypt. Mostly mem-
bers of the lower class, these dancers were 
owned and maintained by the royal court 
forthepurpo eofentertaining thePharoah. 

The Greeks also used dances for simi-
lar purpose . Within their plays and trag-
edies,co turned performers, accompanied 
by music or choral chants, danced in 
competitions before pectators. Greeks also 
used dance to please the gods. The Greeks, 
according to De Mille, even went so far as 
to place dancing on the same level as epic 
poetry and music by worshipping the Muse 
of Dance. 

Withthe comingofChristianity,dance 
was looked upon as a Simple harmless 
game. Religiou rituals were replaced by 
quaint dances like skipping around the 
maypole, and appeasing the gods was 
forsaken for contemporary heroes such as 
Robin Hood. 

However. in the 12th century, accord-
ing to De Mille, theologians began to fee! 
that the practice of dancing was distracting 
and communicated impious ideas. It was 
taken out of holy ritual entirely and has 
remained that way for 800 years. 

While its religious ties seemed to be 
cut, dance still flourished. When Christi-
anity drove the Moors from their strong-
hold in Spain, the meshing of the two 
cultures led to the birth of the Spanish 
dance, or flamenco. 

A combination of heel and toe rhythms, 
encircling arms and undulating hips, this 
dance,deMillesaid, was primarily used in 
bull fights and as a ritual of courtship; it has 
become one of the most well known styles 
of dancing today. 

Perhaps the most important develop-
ment during this period was the creation of 
a simple sweeping motion. Called the 
"volta," it was a means by which a lady 
could be swooped up into the air and be 
placed upon the man's knee. This mere 
motion, according to De Mille, became in 
the 18th century what is now called the 
waltz. Ballroom dancing was born. 

Originally throught to be indecent, the 
impact ofthe volta was soon doused by the 
formal, delicate social dances of the 19th 
century. Usually consisting of intricate 
motions, this method of dancing involved 
fancy floor work, as partners interlaced 

each other's arms and moved through pat-
terns that required momentary separation 
and interchanging. 

According to Lance Lones, a student of 
this form, "Ballroom dancing takes skill, 
knowledge. and physical prowess, much 
more than modem dances. It uses intellect. 
You have to think and then respond. It 's not 
just pure motion." 

It is a simplified version of these 18th 
century dances that has come to character-
ize the baUroomdancingoftoday. Ranging 
from the slow liquid movements of the 
waltz to the quick steps of the fox-trot, they 
resemble the older forms in their intricate 
patterns and interlacing steps. 

According to Lones, 'They make me 
actually look graceful. Grace is inherent in 
all of the dances." 

The medieval royal courts also brought 
about another form of dancing, one which 
has remained, according to De Mille, a long 
unbroken tradition of Western theater: bal-
let. The year was 1581 and though per-
formed,in Paris, the ballet was actually the 
brainchild of an Italian, Baldassarino de 
Belgiojoso. 

According to Jack Anderson, author of 
Dance, Belgiojoso's aid was sought by 
Catherine de Medici when her sister was to 
be married. De Medici wanted to make the 
impending wedding spectacular, so she 
called upon Belgiojoso to devise some sort 
of entertainment. 

What De Medici got was the first at-
tempt at a choreographed staged ballet. The 
queen was pleased with the end result, and

the form began to catch on at other royal 
courts. 

With the corning of the 17th century, 
ballet began to look more like it does today. 
It was transposed from the courts to the 
stage, thus allowing the audience to face the 
dancers straight on. This permittedchoreog-
raphers not only to emphasize ensembles 
but also lo take liberties with the individuals 
as well. 

The professionalism of ballet continued 
through the l700s and in the 19th century it 
was heightened by twofurtherdevelopments, 
both finally bringing it to where it remains 
today. These were the use of tights as a 
costume piece, and of wires to lower a 
ballerina to the floor so that she seemed to be 
posed upon her toe. 

Both ballet and ballroom dancing have 
helped to continue the tradition of dance 
with the transferral of some of their steps to 
rnodemdance. They have helped bring about 
tap, jazz, and countless others. And it is 
interesting to note that some of the sporadic 
movements we find within these dances 
remotely resemble those of the drum beat-
ing primitives oflong agr-. 

It seems that dance has, in a way, come 
full circle. And it has taught us a lot about 
ourselves and the feelings within us. 

As one l3-year veteran of the ballet said, 
"It's overwhelming when you are on stage 
and you are someone else like Princess 
Aurora or the Gold Fairy. It doesn't matter 
who you are in life because for those few 
minutes you are beautiful - truly beauti-
ful."

"Music may stimulate the production of 
endorphins in the brain, thus helping to reduce 
the perception of pain and create a positive 
state of mind," Harvey explained. 

The pulsating effect of the music may 
have these healing powers, but it can also 
curtail the amount of conversation two indi-
viduals may have on the dance floor. The 
solution, then, is to communicate with your 
bodies. 

"Dance is a fonn of communication ex-
pressing that which cannot be expressed in 
words," said Paul Spencer, in his book Soci· 
ety and the Dance. 

Spencer also said that dance and music 
should be considered as mode of human 
communication "on a continuum from the 
nonverbal to the verbal ." Thus, although 
people may steal funive glances from one 
another, the real communication lies in the 
dancing. 

The subdued atmosphere in dance clubs 
makes it difficult for people to judge others in 
terms of physical appearance and disposition, 
according to senior Johnny Gogo. 

'The flashing lights suggest a provocative 
atmosphere, and there is an equalizing factor 
in that people are less apprehensive to judge 
by looks because of the dim lighting," Gogo 
said. 

Gogo also commented that loud music 
acts as a good defense mechanism if you're 
annoyed by someone. 

"You canjust act like you can't hear them 
and they'll get the hintandleave," said Gogo. 

The set-up of dance clubs is designed to 
meet the needs and comfons of their patrons. 
There is an area for dancing, another for 
mingling and resting, and waiters and wait-
resses are always coming around wishing to 
refresh their customers with beverages and 
snacks. 

"It's the ideal situation for single people," 
remarked one bartender of a Pacific Beach 
dance club. "There's energetic available 
people dressed up, looking for a good time. 
And plenty of alcohol to get rid of your , 
insecurities. " 

The dance clubs in this county can be 
cortsidereda melting pot of diverse individu-
als, where one can go to meet different types 
of people. 

As one woman said, "One minute I can be 
dancing with a sophisticated yuppie and the 
next I'll be with a redneck. What a variety." 

Because of the the excitement of a night of 
dancing, the music, and a bounty of potential .

LETTERS of LOVE 
• Play explores mail/fe-mail relationships at the Old Globe 
By Amy Knoke 
Staff Writer 

... Scott - there)s nothing in all the lPorld I 
want but you - and your precious love - all the 
material things are nothing. Pd just hate to live 
a sordid) colorless existence - because you)d soon 
love me less - and less - and Pd do any thing-
anything - to keep your heart for my own - I 
dort)t wa1lt to live - I want to love first) and live 
incidentally .... 

- Letter from Zelda Fitzgerald to 
F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1919 

The love letter is definitely the most personal 
combination of words that the human soul can 
yield. Using the word "soul" seems appropriate 
because almost anyone who has made an at-
tempt at a love letter knows that the contents do 
not flow exclusively from the heart. More accu-
rately, the words come from all that is rational 
and irrational within the body. These letters are 
unique in that they can be a defiant form of 
declaration to a lover, but a love letter's emi-
nent purpose is to document the growth of a 
relationship - which is exactly the case in A.R. 
Gurney's popular drama, "Love Letters." 

Having enjoyed the immense success of his 
first play, "The Cocktail Hour," Gurney fol-
lowed it up with the acclaimed "Love Letters," 
garnering a flurry of great reviews in New York, 

Los Angeles, and presently in San Diego. The 
p~enomenal audience response to the play's no-
frills scenery and two-person cast persuaded the 
Old Globe Theater in Balboa Park to grant it all 
extended set of showings. 
. Although a majority of the show's popularity 
IS due to the story-line, credit must also be given 
to the minimalistic stage, the W1iqueness of the 
script's delivery, and to the two solitary actors on 
whom all attention is focused. 

Although the stage designs of "Cats " and "Les 
Miserables" are known for pumping adrenalin 
into the imaginations of some audiences, other 

~eat~r~oers may be pleasan~y surprised by the 
sunplicny of Gurney's chotce of design. An 
unobtrusive table, two chairs, two reading stands 
for the letters, and two glasses of water, appear as 
the only objects that could possibly distract from 
the dialogue. The absence of set changes aids the 
effectiveness of the letter readings; all of the 
play's energy rides on the power of the spoken 
word. 

The premise of "Love Letters" at first can 
seem vacuous and unimaginative : how exciting 
can it be to watch and listen to two people read 
aloud their ~etters to one another? Fortunately, 
Gurney realized that when the written word has 
a perfectly-timed delivery and is skillfully ex-
ecuted, the result can be overwhelming for those 
on the receiving end. Page H9

Elgian Marbles is one of San Diego' s most recent 
and energetic young bands who are just starting to 
make a name for themselves on the local scene. The 
quartet's bright and invigorating guitar-driven 
melodies, reminiscent of the pop bands coming out 
of the 1960's, are refreshing in a

Muses and Miracle Legion. However, Elgian Marbles 
create a very complex sound that can't really be pinned 
down to a certain band or musical category. and that's 
one of the reasons their songs seem so fresh . When 
asked to describe their sound, Dirkes explained. "We're

into a blender. tum it on. pour it out. and that 's us." 

to be the undisputed heavy-
weight champion of the airwaves. fII'::-~-~~~~~~~~~~ 

Their music itself is prob-
ably best described as a hybrid 
of the guitar-driven power pop 
that came out of the 1980's. 
mixed with the new They Might 
Be Giants-style sound that is 

Elgian Marbles is comprised 1l~~~~~~J;~-'~~~~ 
of guitarist Jorge Taylor, drum-
mer Jeff Dirkes, lead vocalist Quinton Huckeby, and 
bassist Mark Daugherty, who is a senior at UCSD. 
Prior to the formation of the band, Taylor, Dirkes. 
and Daugherty had been playing in a band called 
Peruvian Mutt, which performed a good number of 
gigs around the San Diego area. but broke up after 
the lead singer left the group last summer·. The three 
remaining band members then uecided to start over 
with a new name, and more importantly, a steady 
lead singer. While at The Bacchanal one night a few 
months ago. Taylor, Dirkes. and Daugherty were 
immediately impressed with the stage-presence of 
Huckeby. who at the time was singing for another 
local San Diego band. Granfloonbus. 

''The instant we saw Quinton, we knew right 
away that he'd be the perfect front-man for our 
band., "Dirkes stated.. They met Huckeby. and worked 
very quickly to pull him into the group. By the end 
of the summer the band was complete, but one thing 
left undecided was the band's name. According to 
Dirkes, "Mark just walked in one day and threw out 
the name 'Elgian Marbles · ... and it stuck." 

While listening to the band it is easy to hear the 
wide range of POP. progressive. and hard-edged 
rock influences in their music. This is due in a large 
part to the highly diversified tastes of all four band 
members. whose personal influences range all the 
way from John Cage and The Smiths to Throwing 

starling to come out of the nineties. But there is also a 
strong 1960's undercurrent in their music. Taylor's 
guitar riffs do a particularly nice job of taking the 
classic folk-rock qualities of early 1960's songs like 
the Beatles' "She Loves You." and adding a sped up 
and highly 1990's feel to them. 

But call Elgian Marbles "another 60's retro-band," 
and Taylor might very well hit you over the head with 
his vintage Gibson electric guitar. Although the band 
does have a good deal of early-rock influences. they 
also have a very modem groove concept that forms the 
basis of many of their songs. For instance. "Word of 
the Day" is a screaming. distorted Hawaii 5-0 classic 
tbat shines with modernity. This is probably the kind 
of song that would be produced if B ill Haley. R.E.M., 
and Metallica got together to jam for a few hours. 

Huckeby served as the voice of Elgian Marbles, 
but it seemed as if when the music stopped playing. so 
did his flow of words. But when asked if we could look 
at his lyric sheet, he wryly quipped. "You might as well 
smell my underwear - they're not that impre~sive." 

As for the band's immediate plans, they are going 
to work on fine-tuning the technical aspects of their 
sound and. at the same time. anempt to get a few good 
gigs under their bell. They will be performing at 
Megalopolis on Dec. 1 at 9 p.m .• and they will also be 
performing with Miniature and Doppleganger at Mira 
Mesa parle. on Dec. 9.

Cocteau Twins: Touring and Talking Again 
By Paul Bishop 
Staff Writer 

There was a slight pause as he pondered 
the question. A second later he responded in 
his thick London accent: 

"Well, I don't think there was anything 
wrong at the time, really. The last show went 
quite well, actually. I think that we just 
wanted to spend more time recording,that's 
all." 

This was the seemingly simple explana-
tion bassist Simon Raymonde gave as to 
why the Cocteau Twins stopped touring. 
After all, up to that last show, the British trio 
had been doing quite well in Europe. And 
thanks to a liberal contract with the indepen-
dent label, 4AD, the Cocteau Twins were 
preny much in control of what they wanted 
to do, so why not take a break? 

ing live, Raymonde is quite happy to be on 
tour. The Cocteau Twins are comprised of 
Raymonde, founder Robin Guthrie, and vo-
calist Elizabeth Fraser. In addition, two ex-
tra guitarists will be assisting them in con-
cert. 

Those going to a Cocteau Twins show 
can expect a wonderful blending of satu-
rated, hypnotic guitarand keyboards. played 

In the early to mid-eighties Europe had 
discovered the Cocteau Twins ' sound, and 
was so impressed that one writer for NME 
dared to describe them as "the voice of 
God." Agitated with this statement, the band 
never forgave the writer. 

"People think that since we make music 
like this. that our personalities are the same," 
Raymonde said. "We always get these inter-

different ways of expressing our aggres-
sions in the music now. Things have 
changed." 

The most dramatic change within the 
band might be the new child. Fraser, who 
has had a relationship with Guthrie since the 
beginning of the Cocteau Twins, recently 
had her first child with him. In fact, Lucy 
wasbom right in the middle of recording the 
album. which certainly makes her one of the 
major changes within the band. 

"Before Lucy had come. Liz had a hard 
time with doing the vocal tracks," said 
Raymonde. "Things slowed down towards 
the time she was due. But after Lucy was 
born. things were a lot easier. And Liz 
would be in the studio, recording the vocals 
with Lucy in her arms. It was great!" 

Evidently, it was Lucy that inspired the 
lyric for the song "Iceblink Luck," the first 
single off the album. 

As for music, what does Raymonde lis-
ten to outside the Cocteau Twins? 

Well, theCocteau Twins' break from the 
public eye ended up lasting over four years, 
evading all publicity, save the rave reviews 
of their albums. With a reputation to produce 
the most consistently beautiful music of the 
1980s, they were not in fear of losing their 
popularity. 

Cocteau Twins from (/ to r) Robin Guthrie. Elizabeth Fraser, and Simon Raymonde "r really don't listen much to any music 
really." he said. "Idon't know, maybe Dee-
Lite or something. But, I mean. when you 
spend a day in the studio listening to music 
all day, the last thing you want to do is go 
home and listen to more music. I actually see 
all this as a hobby." 

And in those last fou r years, many a 
journalist and fan has wanted a closer look at 
the elusive band. And it seems that fmally 
many will get their chance, as they are 
touring again ... and talking. 

In the interview, Raymonde explained 
their break from the press: 

"It came to be that we would become 
quite irritable in interviews. We'd be put in 
a room for eight hours, and the journalists 
would come in and out, all asking the same 
questions. By the end of the day you'd be 
sick of your own voice." He laughed, "We're 
actually very happy people, it 's just that you 
journalists fucked us off!" 

Now that they have returned to perform-

by Guthrie, reinforced by mesmorizing drum 
machine rhythms and lurid basslines from 
Raymonde. Floating over this is singer 
Fraser's voice. singing usually indecipher-
able lyrics (which she chooses for phonetic 
beauty. not meaning). Raymonde elucidated 
how theirs is not music to be interpreted. 

"After doing an album. I'm asked the 
strangest questions about the music. Al-
though I did it. it doesn't mean I know 
exactly what it's about. The process of writ-
ing a song is a drawn out thing that has many 
feelings going into it on different days. And 
those feelings woo't help explain the reac-
tion others get from the music, so why even 
try to explain the music at all, is what I 
wonder."

... Here Comes Mary's Danish, Dude 
By Jason Dulde 
Staff Writer 

"It's a sexual innuendo" i all 
vocalist Gretchen Seager cared to 
say regarding the derivations of 
her band's name - Mary's Dan-
ish. Referral to the band as "hers:' 
however, is a claim that would be 
rebuffed not only due to her incli -
nation towards unobtrusiveness 
(seemingly incongruous with her 
raucous tage presence), but out of 
justice to the equitable relation hip 
among the band members. 

Beyond the role of a song's 
original presentation by it writer 
10 the rest of the band, there are no 
actual leaders. 

The product of this collective 
creativity is a funky and ebullient 
musical form , showcasing the 
boldly facetious , mock-country 
hick, frenzied. intertwining vocal 
of Seager and Julie Ritter. Due to 
the captivating vivacity of the 
music, the sincere pointedness of 
Seager's and Riner's lyric will 
remain to some forever undi cov-
ered. 

This boisterous form is so 
plainly powered by pure, spirited 

Spirits

St. Germain 

caprice that one wonder wheth ' r 
this i not a pervasive characteris-
tic of the band a a whole. 

And, indeed, it is just thi type 
of whimsicality that forms the soul 
of Mary 's Danish. "Things take 
about five to 10 minute to figure 
out in this band," guitarist David 
King aid, referring to the band' 
ways of making democratic deci-

" We opened up for 
Jane's Addict ion in 
Santa Barbara and 
some girl lifted up her 
shirt, and she had no 
bra on, so all the guys 
signed her boobs." 

- Gretchen Seager 

sions. 
"We've always done things off-

the-cuff,"heconlinued. This policy 
is manifest in such songs as "Can I 
Have A Smoke, Dude?" and 
"D.V.B ." from their 1989 debut 

San Diego's Most Unique Liquor Store 
3251 Holiday Court, Suite 101 • La Jolla • 455-1414 

album .. . there goes the the New Music Festival in the ir 
lI'ollderll'llck. 

Regarding the genesis of "Can I 
Have A Smoke, Dude?" Seager 
explained, "Wag rChris Wagner, 
bassist] wrote that song , and Julie 
and I were like 'Okay, Wag, what' 
the title?' In the meantime ome-
one in the room asked, 'Hey man, 
can I have a smoke, dude?,' and 
Wag goes 'It's a song called 'Can 
I Have A Smoke, Dude ... ' Ritter 
and Seager then proceeded to cre-
ate the lyrics around the title. 

With respect to "D.V.B.," 
Seager continued, "Wag made it 
up; it's a fictional Distorted Vagi-
nal Bib, whatever that it. It 's just 
Wag's insanity; he just made it up 
from his lewd, morbid, wonderful 
sen e of humor. " 

Thi off-the-wall atmopshere is 
also found in their live perfor-
mances, a fact to which Seager 
alludes: "We opened up for Jane's 
Addiction in Santa Barbara and 
some girl lifted up her shirt, and 
he had no bra on, so all the guys 

signed her boobs." 
The whimsicality of Mary 's 

Danish was a factor last spring at 

impromptu rendition of "Sweet 
Home Alabama" in response to 
reque t from a member of the 
audience. 

Having a knowledge of the 
ong ex tending carcely further 

than that of anyone owning a ra-
dio,Mary 's Danish spontaneously 
broke into the tune, lyrics beyond 
the title limited to " ... where the 
skies are so blue" and "Lord, I'm 
comin' home to you." 

Not only does the band rely 
heavi ly upon crowd input fortheir 
sets, but for their studio record-
ings as well . 

Referring to their studio cover 
of Jimi Hendrix's "Foxy Lady" 
on their live EP Experience, King 
claimed, "'Foxy Lady' was a re-
hearsal jam thaI sounded pretty 
good so we decided to play illive, 
and the crowd dug it. It was the 
vibes we got from the crowds 
playing it live [that made us de-
cide to record it]. 

"[The EP] was basically put 
oul to the fans we already had, as 
a taste of where we're at and of 
what's to come," King continued, 

alluding 10 Ihei r 
forthcoming LP, due 
out in mid-January. 

Chameleon 
Record s touts 
Mary 's Danish as 
being "a drug that hits 
you right in the 
bloodstream and 
leaves you begging 
for more." 

King prefers real-
ism to metaphors of 
dubious accuracy , 
stating simply, "We 
take the music very 
seriously, but it 's all 
about fun , and that's

Talking With a Budding Star 
By Richard Crepeau 
Staff Writer 

Say the name a couple of times; 
look at it until all meaning is lost. 
That 's one thing I like abou t the Dar-
ling Buds, they have a cute name that 
easily loses its meaning. II doesn't 
always work - justtry saying "Faster 
Pussycat. " 

I was looking forward to meeting 
the band, wondering what's behind 
the flowers and junk that MTV is 
feeding me. Waiting in the lobby of a 
local hotel I spied Harley, Chris, and 
Jimmy walking in,lookinglikedeath-
cargo on a trans-Atlantic flight. I was 
really looking forward to the inter-
view then, and I'm sure they felt the 
same way. I was trying to get things 
straight in my mind: Harley's the 
guitarist, Chris is on bass,and Jimmy 
is their new drummer from a band 
called Black. San Diego is Iheir first 
stop on their first American tour. 

thing was missing, also. Something 
female. It was then that I felt a tap on 
my shoulder and turned around: it 
was their label's representative, let-
ting me know that Andrea, the Dar-
ling Buds' singer, was ready to talk 
with me up in her room. What about 
the rest of the band? I turned around. 
They had disappeared.! walked with 
the representative to Andrea's room, 
all the whiletryingto match the band's 
image with its sound. The label's 
press release is soaked with "flower-
power" and ·'psychedelic." 

Get this: "Their explosive mix of 
brazen honesty and guileless hedo-
nism has made them a walking, talk-
ingevent: a post-Warhol ian pet, wet-
dream." 

knocked on the door and the Buds' 
manager opened up and ushered us 
into the sui te. Andrea was on the bed, 
talking on the phone,looking younger 
I han the press pholos make her appear. 
I gotthe impression she was a teenage 
girl, lying on the hed, legs twisting 
around each other while she spoke 
into the receiver. Her eyes roved the 
ceiling until she noticed me, then she 
scrunched her face to say hello and 
moved on. 

Andrea got off the phone and the 
introductions began. I asked her about 
her band-mates and she said they just 
arrived from England. She, on the 
other hand, had been in the Statl's all 
weekend - no wonder she looked so 
fresh. She brushed her blonde hairout 
of her eyes and sat down in front of 
me. She was wearing black spandex 
biking shorts with a mini skirt over it 
and a finely panemed shirt. 

Shouldn' t they have been exci ted, 
"Their explosive mix of brazen honesty and guileless hedonism has made them a walking, talking event. H or was I expecting too much? Some-

Huh? It all went over my head -
the band's new album Crawdaddy is 
anything but psychedelic. To me, its 
good old power pop that reminded 
me of Paul Collins' Beat and the 
Plimsouls. 

So we got 10 Andrea's room, 

She was really excited about tour-
ing in America. " We're not sure ex-

actly how its going to be, butwc' ve 
really been looking forward to it. A 
lot of the groups we know come 
back and tell us how great it is out 
here,"Andrea gushed. 

Thc band booked themselve in 
a lot of small c lubs on this tour. "In 
a sense," she said , "its like we're 
starting out all over again." What 
sort of venues are they used to 
playing? 

"It all depends on what part of 
England we ' re touring. In Wales, 
where we ' re from, we'll playa 
2,000 seat theater. Same thing in 
Manchester. Other places will be 
the smaller halls and clubs." This 
definitely is a band that won't be 
caught lip-syncing. 

The Buds have been playing 
together for about four years now 
and they made the jump from their 
independent label, Darling, to Co-
lumbia over a year ago. 

"Thcre's not that much differ-
ence, really, when you get down to 

, it," she said. "At least in England. 
I get the impression that the indie 
scene out here isn't as extensive. 

" Now and again we come up 
against the impression that because 
we 're on a major label, we must 
have sold out somewhere, but I 
feel the band still has control over 
itself and is still able to sound the 
way we want," she explained. 

Does she like the business of 
rock and roll? 

"It's got its good and bad sides. 
I don't mind the after-gig parties 
and all that, but I could do without 
the videos and promotion. I just 
like playing the music, really," she 
claimed. The new album Craw-
daddy was produced by Stephen 
Street, who has worked with the 
Smiths and Morrissey. 

Andrea explained that his style 
of working was similar to Pat 
Collier (of the Vibrators) who pro-
duced their first album P op Said. 

"They were both great. We liked 
their styles. Both let us be our-
selves and they didn't try to force 
any changes on us. Their sounds, 
of course, are different and the 
guitars are more dirty with Stephen 
on the second album - which we 
like,"Andrea said. 

"We do have an EP coming ou[ 
which we produced oursel ves," she 
continued. "The people who have 
listened to it say that it comes 
closest to the way we sound live." 

Rolling the band 's name around 
my mind a few times, I a ked how 
they came up with it. Andrea smiled 
in amu em em. 

"Harley came up with it. It 's a 
Shakespeare so~net , you know. It 's 
really beautiful. Also, it's the title 
of a book by H .E. Bates - The 
Darling Buds of May. It's a hys-
terical story about a mad English 
family."We were straying, and the 
manager knew it - one more 
glance at her watch. It was about 
time I wrapped things up. 

We bid our farewells and I 
wa lked away impressed with 
Andrea's abili ty to communicate 
without singing; she seems to work 
just a well off the album as she 
does on it. 

After playing their gig Tue day 
nightallheSportsArena with Wire 
Train, and long after the interview, 
I'm sure the Darling Buds have 
begun to settle in to the grind of 
touring. 

Because everyone kn~s that 
" ... Rough winds do shake the dar-
ling buds of May / And ummer's 
lease hath all too hort a date." 
(Bill Shake peare).

Eno/cal. 
Wrong Way Up 
Opal 

If you enjoy hypnotic, relaxing 
music but are reluctant to buy 
crystals and listen to Windham Hill 
records, perhaps you should listen 
to this collaboration by Brian Eno 
and John Cale.The fusion on Wrong 
Way Up provides for some stimu-
lating meditation. Although this is 
jointly produced and written, Eno 
comes off as the dominant partner. 
The layered production is remi-
niscent ofEno's Before and After 
Science days and his characteristic 
lush harmonies are readily appar-
ent. However, the songs on which 
Cale sings are the darker tracks, 
both beautiful and disturbing at the 
same time. It is the Cale that brought 
us ArtiJiciallntelligence, not the 
Velvet Underground that comes 
through. 

Many styles come together in 
this work and each song is unique. 
Surprisingly, the album feels uni-
fied, not contrived and fractured. 
"One Word" is a very upbeat and 

danceable song with an afro-pop 
flavor. Also, "Spinning Away" is 
equally danceable, but would nOI 
be found in th~ typical dance club. 
What is enchanting about these 
songs in particular, and the whole 
album in general, is the lack of an 
overpowering drum track. Eno 
refers to this as a "rhythm bed." 

On the other end of the spec-
trum are songs such as "In the 
Backroom" and "Footsteps."These 
songs have slow, expected rhythms 
and melody lines that take odd 
turns that could only be creations 
of John Cale.This album is nicely 
woven and meticulously produced; 
there really isn ' t a bad song on it. 
Although it isn ' tan album that will 
garner much attention, any effort 
put into looking for it and listening 
will be greatly rewarded.

Wartime 
Fast Food For Thought 
Chrysalis Records 

The best word to describe 
Wartime 's sound is heavy. Heavy, 

Thc UCSD Guardian 

like Deep Purple meeting Rick 
James. Relying solely on bass and 
programmed drums, Wartime 
crawls forth from the darkest cor-
ners of the industrial cavern. Bass 
is the foundation upon which 
Wartime's music is built. Low-
end bass lines work as part of the 
rhythm section while fuzzy high-
end distorted bass fills in the guitar 
parts. Needless to say, bass play-
ing is what Wartime is all about 
and the musician responsible is 
Andrew Weiss, bassrnaster for 
Henry Rollins Band. Weiss and 
Rollins Band sound man Theo Van 
Rock co-produce Wartime. Henry 
Rollins. singer for the now defunct 
Black Flag, is along for the ride 
providing mystical raps and raspy 
vocals for a cover of "Franklin's 
Tower" by The Grateful Dead. 

Fast Food For Thought, as the 
title suggests, has five songs that 
hit in the head and the guts at the 
same time. The fir st track, 
"Minefield," assaults your ears 
with samples of Apocalypse Now 
and gunshots to prepare the listener 
for the layers of funky bass lines 
and piles of drumbeats . Rollins ' 
words are as focused and powerful 
as they are when he sings with his 
band or gives a poetry reading. For 
him it's all just an extension of the 
Rollins Experience. 

The best song on the record is 
'The Whole Truth," which begins 
sounding like a sinister monster 
movie themeand then breaks into a 
minimalist funk groove that is 
danceable enough to be played in 
clubs. This funky number is 
shocking in contrast to Rollins 

Band's grungy rock. It featured a 
rap about how. "you can stay at 
arms-length/away from life!but it 
takes strength/to get up close/and 
goaU the way live." While most of 
the lyrics deal with life being Ii 
battle, this record is the first major 
label release from Rollins and Co., 
and hopefully that will mean that 
they won't have to struggle as hard 
to bring their battle to turntables 
and CD players across the country.

Anthrax 
Persistence of Time 
Island Records 

Anthrax is back and better than 
ever after a two-year hiatus since 
their 1988 album State of Eupho· 
ria. With their new album, Per-
sistence of Time, Anthrax shows 
that they are evolving into a more 
serious and consistent band. 

On their previous two albums, 
Among the Living and State of 
Euphoria, Anthrax displayed ex-
treme talent on about half of each 
album. The other half failed to 
show the band's full potential and 
turned out 10 be rather disappoint-
ing. However, from beginning to 

HIATUS 7 

end, the new album is filled with 
hard rhythms and intell igent lyrics. 

Perhaps the biggest standout on 
the album is the instrumental , "Intro 
to Reality." Although it eventually 
leads right into the next song, it 
could easily stand on its own, and 
is definitely oneofthe better heavy 
metal instrumentals. 

Persistence of Time will defi-
nitely solidify Anthrax as one of 
the top of the heavy metal giants 
for a long time to come.

Bridge Over 
Troubled Waters 
By Karla D.Stange 
Staff Writer 

Anyone who enjoys looking at 
oldfamilyalbums hould seeJames 
Ivory's new movie "Mr & Mrs. 
Bridge." The film itself is like a 
collection of snapshot , and the 
pictures are reminders that all 
families have problems. 

Bridge, a couple who begin to 
question their love and con unit-
ment to each other after their chil-
dren have grow up and moved 
away. 

The UCSD Guardian Friday, November 30,1990 

Ivory i most noted for direct-
ing the award-winning "Room 
With A View," and the more re-
cent "New York Stories." His new 
film is adapted from two novels by 
Evan S. Connel, Mr. Bridge and 
Mrs. Bridge. It is a movie about the 
complex web of relationships 
within an American middle-class 
family set in Kansas in the 1930s. 
Paul Newm an and Joanne 
Woodward co-star as Mr. and Mrs. 

The gaps between genders and 
generations are trong themes in 
the film, and they both inspire sad-
ness and humor. Another theme 
concerns a hunger for love, and an 
inability to communicate this need. 
There is also a fight for indepen-
dence and self-expression as the 
Bridge's three children struggle to 
escape a cramped lifestyle in sub-
urbia. 

Mr. Bridge (Paul Newman) and Mrs. Bridge (Joanne Woodward) wishing their daughter well 

Woodward and Newman, who 
are married in real life, make a 
wonderful and exasperatingly re-
alisti couple. ewman proves 
again that he is aver atile actor in 

his portrayal of a stubborn, moral-
istic patriarch. 

Through his silence and his stiff 
facial expressions, he conveys a 
character who is confused and bit -
ter about the changing values of 
his country-club haven. 

He delivers a sermon to his 
skeptical daughter: "Love, respect, 

human decency - those things 
never change." 

The stoic Walter Bridge makes 
a wonderful contrast to his teary-
eyed, compassionate wife. 
Woodward is perfect as India 
Dridge, an embarrassingly proud 
and over -protecti ve mother. In one 
scene, she is elated when her

youngest son Douglas (Robert Sean 
Leonard) visits her on leave from 
the army. Her sloppy kisses a nd 
near-hysterical babbling in this 
scene are right on the mark. 

Woodward succeeds increating 
a character worthy of empathy. 
She expresses a desperate longing 
for love from her callous husband 
and children. 

This sad and powerful longing 
is poignantly exempified during a 
final scene where she is trapped in 
a locked car in the snow, crying,: 
" Is anyone there?" 

Blythe Danner does an fine job 
as Grace Barron, M rs. Bridge ' s 
restless friend who is suffocated 
by her boring lifestyle. The 
Bridge's children, Ruth, (Kyra 
Sedgwick) Carolyn, (Margret 
Welsh) and Do'uglas , also manage 
to capture this fierce need to es-
cape the narrow confines of middle-
class life. 

The cinematography in "Mr.& 
Mrs. Bridge" is elegant and crisp, 
with sweeping views of the Kan-
sas countryside. There is an em-
phasis on the changes of the season 
that suggests the alternating 
warmth and frigidity of relation-
ships within the family. One ex-
ample of this is a frightening and 
funny scene where the Bridges 
refuse to leave a restaurant during 
a violent tornado. 

The film borrows a style that 
creates a series of impressions 
about human relationships, like 
" Driving Miss Daisy," and the 
more recent "Avalon," where the 
focus is on characterization instead 
of a cohesive, action-packed plot. 

But for anyone who has ever 
suffered from the thorny tangles of 
family conflicts, it is a relief to see 
that no family is perfect, even those 
with affluence and security. 

This movie is like a bridge be-
tween all American families. It 
links us together through common 
experiences, and places all of our 
snapshots into one huge, over-
stuffed photo album.

turns throughout. 

Whether he's singing about the 
need for a little honesty (''Tell Me 
the Truth") or the secret desire to 
be close to a loved one ("AU [want 
To Do"), the music really seems to 
come from the heart. 

The album is somewhat remi-
niscent of the styles of Richard 
Marx. the Beatles, Glen Frey, and 
the Eagles. 

The result? Timothy B. Schmit 
emerges as a wonderful musician 
who's sharing his emotions with-
out holding back a thing.

LOVE 
Continued from H1 

In the realm of the senses, eye-
s ight assumes a minority role 
having only (he facial express ions 
of the actono concentrate on, while 
the audience's hearing takes on a 
dominant position. For two hours, 
the ears search for the tinges of 
disappointment and excitement 
that sometimes cling to the end-
ings of words, hoping to get some 
sort of clue as to what will happen 
next. 

Rarely is there a moment of 
silence, but when there is, it serves 
as a clear signal that one of the 
characters has stopped writing for 

various reasons. The sight of one of 
the players stoicall y looking 
traightahead with their lips tightly 

pursed produces an uncomfortable 
stillness that pierces through to a 
cenain part of the memory. Un-
willingly you recall the many con-
secutive days of rushing home, 
bursting through the front door, 
and screaming at the top of your 
lungs, "Did] get any mail?" only to 
find that your letter had remained 
unanswered for yet another day. 

Besides enabling the audience 
to remember almost every emo-
tionalletter-writingexrerience that 
they have ever had, "Love Letters" 
seems to ignite a spark for the art of 
letter writing. To be a witness of a

the unpredictable Melissa. than she

between them, they are able to 
accept that what they do have is a 
unique and exclusionary relation-

10 HIATUS 

LETTERS 
Continued from H9 
and at times Melissa and Andy 
believe that their relationship is 
capable of withstanding ome of 
society's mo t difficult problems. 
Their sense of trust flourishes in 
their letters as Andy struggle to 
deal with Meli sa' personal trag-
edie of divorce. :I\cohol abuse, 
and depre s ion. Andy constantly 
urges Melissa to return to her pro-
fession as an artist and although 
she does venture back to her work 
on several occasions, her ability to 
express herself through her an i 
not enough to make her life com-
plete and satisfying. 

There is a single. memorable 
instance in the play in which Mel -
issacan truthfully express content-
menl over the fulfillment of a par-
ticular void in her life. This hap-
pens a Melis a and Andy, ap-
proaching their mid-forties, em-
bark on a whirlwind sexual affair. 
Melissa suddenly develops into a 
vibrant. energetic individual, anx-
iou for continued excursion with 
Andy - she even proposes ideas 
of marriage to him. 

Her life, for a moment, seems 
asifit'son the upswing, but Andy's 
refusals 10 divorce his wife, to 

, "Love Letters' hon-
estly examines the 
scope and boundaries 
of mature love and 
friendship. " 
abandon his family responsibili-
ties, and perhaps put his political 
career in jeopardy, are enough to 
shatter Meli ssa. Theiraffaircomes 
to an abrupt end as they are faced 
with the realities of their relation-
ship. They become acutely aware 
that love does indeed have certain 
limitations. 

The most poignant aspect of 
"Love Letters" is that it honestly 
examines the scope and bound-
aries of mature love and friend-
ship. Although it is clearly under-
stood by the audience thata genuine 
relationship had developed be-
tween Andy and Melilosa. it is also 
apparent that love b not capable of 
dissolving :III the constraints that 
are put upon us and those that we 
impoloe upon ourselves. 

For no matter how many timelo 
or how much an individual i able 
to penetrate and looolhe the emo-
tional wounds of a loved one, it is 
often nOlenough. Melissa Gardner 
carried certain incredible burdens 
within her for her entire life -
exact copies ofthe burdens carried 
by our mothers , our sisters, and our 
friends. 

Although we may feel far re-
moved from those people, Gurney 

make~ u~ realize that it is not the 
stationery, northe penmanship, nor 
the length of the letterthat matters; 
it is the words them elves that lay 
forever in the memories of the 
people that we love.

O'Brien. 
Where : Old Globe Theater,

• Hang 'Em Up: Find a 
Space for All the Banners 

Been inthe UCSD Main Gym lately? 
Have you noticed all the banners 

announcing UCSD's athletic prowess? 
Have you also noticed that there's vir-
tually no room to hang the new one for 
sixth women's volleyball title, much 
less the five from last season that are 
waiting to be unfurled? 

UCSD teams have accomplished so 
mucb in the past 10 years - including 
capturing at least one national title seven 
years running - that the five first or 
second place national finishes last year 
are not even posted on the gym wall. 

One might be led to believe that the 
women's soccer team has never won a 
national title, or that the women' s water 
polo tearn has captured only one cham-
pionship. Wrong on both counts. 

Three second place finishes from last 
season, by the men's and women's 
swimming teams, and the women's 
tennis team, also go unacknowledged 
due to an apparent lack of space. 

The banners have already been made, 
as seen at last year's awards banquet. 
Wouldn't it be a much-deserved holiday 
gift to those teams to flOally fmd some 
space on the wan for their accollades1

Women's Hoop On 
Out-of-state Spree 
Over Winter Break 
• Preview: After two games in 
Northern California this weekend, the 
Tritons don't play another Califomia-
based team until January, beginning 
with a trip to Minnesota after finals 
By Les Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women 's basketball team is hoping to 
have a truly happy holiday season, though not so much 
spreading cheer around the country as creating some for 
itself. The Tritons stall a string of five straight road 
games tonight at UC Santa Cruz. 

The Banana Slugs never prove to be much of an 
obstacle to the Tritons, as UCSD has a history of gamer-
ing playing time for all in these matchups, winning each 
of the 17 previous meetings against UCSC. 

The Tritons head into this evening's contest having 
split their first two games, falling 85-54 at Poim Lorna 
Nazarene two weeks ago, then rebounding to hammer 
visiting Occidental 75-59 the next night . 

After a probable win over the Slugs, UCSD will drive 
about 50 miles nonh to face the College of Notre Dame 
in Belmont. Though the teams did not face each other last 
season, the Tritons are historically 4-0 against their 
small-school competitor. 

• In a game that only 
counts to advance in the 
Redlands Tourney, every 
Triton scored in an 87-69 
victory over Norton AFB 
By Dana Chaiken 
Sports Editor 

In the first round of the University of 
Redlands Tournament last night, the 
UCSD men's basketball team got half of 
its wishes. 

Head Coach Tom Marshall said before 
the tournament that he hoped for an "easy" 
game with Norton Air Force Base so that 
he could use several different players 
and rest his starters. 

That wish was fulfilled in an 87-69 
UCSD triumph, after the Tritons led by 
as many as 44 before the military men 
got a break, trailing 52-22 at halftime. 
Not only was Marshall able to use every 
one of his players, but all 12 Tritons 
posted points. 

Well, kinda. 
Since Nonon is not an NCAA team, 

the win does not count toward UCSD's 
current 4-0 record, and the statistics for 
the game are not official. 

So don't chalk up 17 points for 
UCSD's leading scorer Tim Rapp. Gor-
don McNeill's 14, Rick Batt's 13, and 
Tom Shawcroft's II can also be written 
in the books in pencil. 

Marshall'sotherwish was that UCSD 
would not face Menlo College in the 
tournament semifinal - but not every-
thing can go according to plan. Or can it? 

Marshall said he expected Menlo to 
engage in a "war" with Cal Baptist in its 
opener, and that apparently happened as 
the Oaks pulled off a 72-69 win. 

See M. HOOP, Page 17 

Things don ' t get any easier for the Tritons after finals 
See W. HOOP, Page 17 Sophomore Michelle DiGuilio has assumed the startingpointguardspot. 

Friday, November 30, 1990 

M. HOOP 
Continued from page 16 

In the semifinal of the same 
tournament last season, Menlo 
edged UCSD on a last-second shot 
in double ovenime. 

Marshall thinks his team has 
the advantage this time around for 
two reasons . 

"With all of our players back, I 
think we have probably gelled 
faster than they have this early in 
the season," Marshall said. 

Additionally, the energy edge 
in the 6 p.m. game will probably 
fall to the Tritons, as they cruised 
last night while the Oaks remained 
unbeaten in a much closer matchup 
with the Lancers. 

Still, Marshall claimed Menlo, 
"is one of the top two Division III 
teams in California." The Oaks 
return all but two guards from a 
tearn that captured two of three 
from UCSD last season. 

After the final round at Redlands 
tomorrow, the Tritons break for 
finals, and resume December 12 
by hosting Division ill Universi ty 
of La Verne. 

Three days later. UCSD ven-

tures to Newhall to face off with 
The Master 's in a game that 
Marshall predicted will be " brutal , 
especiaUy if we see them in the 
final game of the Redlands tourna-
ment. " 

The Triton have two days to 
recover from that before a rematch 
with Christian Heritage at home. 
UCSD edged the NAIA Hawks 
60-56 in the season opener. 

Redlands. which UCSD could 
potentially see in the final game of 
the Bulldogs ' tournament this 
weekend, comes to town Decem-
ber 22 . 

UCSD closes out 1990 with a 
trip to Pullman, Washington for its 
only Division [competition of the 
season. The Tritons face the Pac-
10 Cougars on December 28. 

The new year opens at home in 
a doubleheader with the UCSD 
women's team, as both Triton 
teams challenge Nazareth College 
(NY) on January 2. 

The La Jolla Classic, in which 
UCSD split two games last season, 
is scheduled for the first weekend 
of Winter quaner, as Bethany. 
Pomona-Pitzer, and La Verne will 
compete. 

The UCSD Guardian

ContInued from page 16 
week. though. as they fly off to 
Minnesota to play HamJine Uni-
versity on December 12, Bethel 
College on the 14th, and former 
Division m National Champion 
College of SI. Thomas the follow-
ing day. 

UCSD has never beaten 
Hamline orSt. Thomas, and Bethel 
provides afresh face for the Tritons. 

The Tritons' spree of out-of-
state competition continues when 
they open a crucial eight-game 
homestand, beginning December 
28 with their three-day UCSD 
Tournament. 

St. Thomas and another former 
national champion, Scranton (PA), 
are possible tournament opponents 
for the Tritons. 

Other teams expected to com-
pete are William Smith (NY), 
Smith (MA), Wheaton (MA), 
Carroll (WI), and Millikin (1L). 

On January 2, UCSD will try to 
prove itself against Nazareth Col-
lege,.which edged out the Tritons 
for a NCAA regional slot two years 
ago, when UCSD finished 19-6.

ROSE Washington *10 Iowa 
COPPER California *1 Wyoming 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... Because this is the last Guardian of the quarter, I thought I'd 
leave you with a little something to mull over for the holidays: more specifically, my 
uncanny expertise on three bowl games. This year's Orange Bowl is clearly the most 
important, as it usually is. And after Notre Dame's victory last year, Colorado has seen 
enough and will get some revenge this year_ The Rose Bowl would have been a10t more 
significant had Washington not lost to UCLA, but either way, the Huskies are still one 
of the nation's best. It seemed like every time I looked, they had scored another 50 
points - and that may happen again against Iowa, a team that impresses nobody. The 
Copper Bowl is particularly significant this year, primarily because of the controversy 
surrounding the state of Arizona's refusal to recognize the Martin Luther King lr. 
holiday, but also because Cal is playing in it. And why is that significant? Come on, 
people_ I'm from Berkeley. That's reason enough_ PHIl.. SAYS ...

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... I could go on and on about all the college bow I games, but after 
the year is over, nobody can ever r~member who won any of the bowls except the 
Orange Bowl anyway, so why bother? Besides, Monday night's matchup between 
these two NFL monsters is far more important than most of the piddly bowls - that 
is, of course, until these two teams meet again in the NFC Championship game, which 
is quite likely to occur. The question is, where will that game occur? A lot depends on 
Monday's game. Both teams are coming off losses, so both teams are equaUy furious. 
Giants' Head Coach Bill Parcells says he doesn't think this game is a important as 
everybody else does_ I think he's nuts. With this kind of attitude, the Niners are going 
to steamroll the Giants and run them straight out of town- which could easily happen, 
especially after a loss to the LA. Lambs, of all teams. But to tell you the truth , this one: 
probably gonna be clo e, but, of course, PHIl.. ADVISES thal you ...

OVER·THE·LlNE WRAPS UP YEAR TWO 
Even though Over-the-Line is perhaps the laziest sport in America, that fact alone did 

nothing to deter many fine athletes from coming out to Pryatel field recen~y to show off their 
talent. The event was the 2nd Annual 1M Over-The-Une Championships. And it was anything 
but dull. 

And the laziness, don't let that fool you. OTl requires intense concentration, great hand-
eye coordination and loads of athlelic talent. And ~ also helps to have a little baseball 
experience. As everyone knows baseball players (w~h the exception of pitchers) are the best 
of all athletes. 

IntramuralOTl finished the year with a double elimination tournament, divided into AA and 
A brackets, all of which was completfid in one fun-filled and hassle-free afternoon. 

In theAA Championships, the finesse of The Studs overcame the slumping Le Trois squad 
to finish the year with an unblemished 1 Hl record. And satisfied they are oot. Brian Andrews, 
Pat Saeger and Greg Wismew, all Delta Sigma Pnis, claim that no IFC team can touch them 
and have ISSued a stiff challenge to all comers. 

"I think we are ready for a run at the OMBAC circuit." team captain Andrews boasted. As 
for le TroIs, It was yet another near miss, and the last hurrahJor Ken "I hope they have Swedish 
girts at Poly· Golovco. 

In the Adivision, Sasquatch Bigfoot and I triumphed over Smell the Glove in a great finish. 
John Pruett. Dan Tyvoll and Mark Murray led the way, each hoPing to move up to the Delfs 
parent club. 

Congratulations to the winners and all the participants. Now its time to hit the beaches over 
the summer and come out swinging next year, as The Studs have promised to come back and 
defend their tiIJe. 

BADMINTON CHAMPS CROWNED 
The AII-Campus Badminton Toumament held Saturday Nov. 17, sent three of UCSD's 

finest players home for Thanksgiving toting brand new sPOrt bags , probably full of dirty laundry. 
The day's first prize- winner emerged form the intermediate division as Tony Rondonuwu 
capped off his undefeated day w~h a t5-4, 15-9 victory over Outer Schwarz. 

The women of the day entered into an eight person division w~h Laura Cummins and 
Jacqueline Huysman facing off In the final. TtJe two women, who hail from the same high 
school, not so coincidentally displayed similar technique, but Cummins squeezed out an 11 -
8, 11 -9 victory to claim the title. 

A full group turned out for the tightly matched Men's Open DiVision. The 13 man field 
included Tom Kao and Defending Champion Jean Marie Roch as the number one & two 
seeds. As expected these two met in the semi-finals of the winners bracket. KaC' ?Utfinessed 
Roch in this initial meeting to annex a t t-6, 10-12, 11-5 VICtOry. 

The double elimination tournament format allowed Roch a chance to fight his way through 
the losers bracket, beating Nghiep Quan in that final (a match that included the 'Play of the 
Day' when Quan used a between the legs shot to save a point), to earn another shot at Kao 
for the cha~nship. The gutty Roch reached back to outlast Kao in the rematch 18-13, t 5-
7, and gain an unprecedented back-ta-back championship. 

With a record number of participants in this event ~ is obvious that UCSO's shuttleheads 
can't get enough action. There may even be a doubles tournament in the future if Interest 
continues to grow.

The season long leader in AA looks like a lock, 
bu1 we're st~1 wondering about their backrow 
defense. Walt and the boys do aI kinds of 
death-<lefying things back there ... proving that 
they'lI do anything to get the ball up. We mean 
anything! It's kind 01 funny to watch. 

2 CHEERS TO ADOLF (17-8)

decided to get serious come play-off line. Now 
that they are, they ain' bad.Bobby (I will play

cases.

Here's another muck-around team that finished 
third in th8lr league. Hey, where have I heard 

Tube Polo Champions Crowned 
AM - SWill FAGS 

Last spring these under-seied cfowns barely 
squeaked out a championship, and they almost 
didn' get the job done this time around. Leading 
at halftime, they coula,1 take advantage oltheir 
scoring opportunities in the second half, while 
TUBESTEAK's J.J. Rsher began to find some 
of the many holes in the FAGS delense. 

The game ended tied at 8. As the overtime 
cfockwounddown, Christy Parker dug a ball out 
01 the comer, gelt fouled, and found Melinda 
Hawley in front of a wide open goal. Hawtey 
finished n off for a 10-8 SWIM FAGS win. 

Good news for the rest of the Tube-Polo 
world, Captn. Daniels says that was probably 
the last Championship for his legendary SCJlad. 
Graduation, old age and loss of brain cells 
should bring this dynasty to an end. FIVe con-
secutive titles, and a 42~ record are both marks 
that are unequaled in Tube-Polo, or 1M history. 
This Bud's lor you! 
AA - FLOATING HIGH ONES 

This veteran squad was seeded third as the 
playoffs began, bu1 reallytumedupthe heat and 
impressively advanced to the finals giving up an 
average of only three goals per game. 

Also reaching the finals was the number four 
seed, WE GOT JACKED. Behind the scoring of 
Wendy Bronson, HIGH ONES jumped out to an 
8-4 halftime lead. Stephanie Vantress woke up 
and tossed in a couple 01 second half goals to 
get JACKED back into the baIIgame, bu1 it was 
six goals Irom Jeff Rector that brought horne the 
title lor HIGH ONES. The final tally 0114-12 
represented the most goals either team had 
given up all season. 
A - TOUCH MY MONKEY

the S4ITl8 league who did not meet during the 
regular season, bu1 who both posted Impressive 
season marks. Touch My IIonIIIy and Bug. 
on Druga leatured offenses designed Iround 
one main scorer. 

l)nfol1Unately, BUGS ON DRUGS had lillie 
else to oI!er except hole-man Adam Stiles. Sure 
he scored seven of their 12 points, bu1 only two 
other players scored for BUGS. Val Kelly led 
everyone with fourteen points for MONKEY, but 
they also had five other players score at least 
one goal. This one was no conIest with a final 
score 01 28-12.

Chris Bass, T m Sutton and the boys are rock 'n 
rolling right now. Aad ... 1hey can make n aI the

45 PISTONS AND A HOllIE (17-8) 
Here's another season long sleeper. Where 
have all these guys been? The Sons of Detroit 
(a bril~ant fourth place league fin-
ish behind them) pulled 011 the year's biggest 
upset Tuesday by waxing the Box Mowers in a 
quick two-setter. By the looks of things, this 
Division will probably be won by 1O-game loser.

3 HOlIER SA YS (20-3) 
'iave only to worry about Weebils to the Net in 
their bracket, and that one could be interesting, 
but we see them giving the Bio-Eng Nerds a real

We'll see how it all shakes out.

The go-karters were slow sta1ers this season 
and when they finIIIy got their entire 181m to 
show up, they illllld out to be pretty good. Ill! 
not awesome, like they shoufd be. Klintworth,

Doug's 1990 Nat'l Champs. But only W they 
show up. H they do, and they're motivated, we

There's only one !lam st~1 out there, that 
hang ~ KART and that's these ladies. 
Kuehne and her talented and tall six t e t 
played the match of their lives fast Monday 
knocking 011 previously undefeated Set, Spike,

match up with KART in the semi, this reallymight 
be the championship match.

Ra:heI SMdweiss and hili dynamne <liggin' 
lIammates' play nasty delense and refuse to 
give in to big attack-oriented teams. That's why 
they rarely lose. But, there's two sides to this

a fillle short on the offensive 8fld.

INTRAIIUIIAL FOO1'ULL WIIANIP 
It was a great season with some great thrills and spills (right Prabs). But it's all over and 

Ws history in the books. . 
The Men's 'AAA' finals should have been billed as the Scoop Troy show. Why for? 

Because 01' Scoop scored four touchdowns in the finals to lead Yortl Hunt Club to semi-
thrilling victory over the SAE', 3.1-30. 

It was a great game of no defense w~h both teams racing up and down the field. OB Bob 
Knee had a great game forthe SAE's but he just couldn't get away from Scoop when the chips 
were down. 

In the Men's 'M ' final (Get-A-GrIpdel. Too Dru"I! to Score 13-6), we had both usual and 
unusual occurences. The unusual occurrence? Get-A-Grip b it playing splendidly. Why 
so unusual? Because they won the 'A' championship last year the same way. And it makes 
us wonder why they played 'A' last year. Get-A-Grip, sandbagging again? Nah! 

The usual? The awesomely talented Bushmen losing agaio in the semi-finals. A move 
to 'AAA' next year on their part and maybe they can eliminate their el-gaggo tendencies. 

The 'A' final featured a big, big upset. The New England Patriots over the San Francisco 
498rs would be less of an upset than DIed er.w over the almighty SIcIdIm'l FIyIrI. 
Saddam's Flyers had ~all;speed, size and smarts. But Breit Egusaand his Dead Crew mates 
were just too rruch for Saddam's Gaggers. Dead Crew won H 16-6. 

The Coed 'M' final was arguably the bes1 football game ever played at UCSD. It would 
take pages to define the drama that unfolded and unfortunately we've only got one. 

You want great catches. Try Allison HensIeit catching a touchdown pass between her 
knees. You want great passes. Try Gina Lomontia drilling a two point conversion to Kevin 
Gelbardwith no time remaining to win ~40-39. You want great defense. Try tricky Rick Nowak 
playing the whol!) fiiekj but just not having enough speed to cover up for every one else's 
shortcomings. All in all, n was wen worth freezing our you-know-whats offwak:hing this game. 

TheCoed 'A'finalwasanotherupset.thI~KIdIR_totileoccasionand 
winning the chafT1lionship over U c.n1 RullI UI, 2G-14. The Kids should have been called 
the Cardiac Kids Instead because atl of their games leading up to the finals were won by one 
point. Obviously, they clutched up when they had to. 

The Women's final was another classic defensive bailie with c.olyn Who? pulling a mild 
upset by defeating LoIt In Till Fogg 13-6 in the final. led by superstar Deekla Marsha" and 
super stelKly Nicole Morita, CW was just a lillie bit better than lost In The Fogg when It 
counted.
