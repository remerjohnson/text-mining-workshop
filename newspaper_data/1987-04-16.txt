Asian 
~ourses 
offered 
By JAMES PINPIN, 'I~U Wnll'f 

An A ian-American stud ies 
course under UC Berkeley 
associate professor Ling-chi Wang 
is ' being offered at UC D this 
spring quarter. The course, 
"Comparative Hi tOry of Asian 
Experience in America" (HIST 
191), is in a probationary status 
because the administration is 
testing the need, intere t and 
support of UC D students for such 
a class. 

Professor Wang and Professor 
James Lin, a member of the UCSD 
math depanment and the teacher 
of last spring's Asian-American 
studies course, hope that this 
course will pave the way for a 
permanent Asian-American 
studies program here in San Diego. 
Wang and Lin both pointed out 
that except for U an Francisco 
(which i ' bdsically a medical 
school), UCSD is the only other 
universIty tn the UC system 
without d tenured Asian-American 
studies faculty member. 

"T here is a large enough A ian 
population to warmnt the class," 
Lin saId. He pointed out that Asian 
students are the largest growing 

. (about 20 percent incoming), 
e~pecially in the UC system. Lin 
also added that support for the 
class IS not only coming from 
tudents and teachers, but from 

other members of thc community.

Re-elections 1987 
Continued from page 1 
formu la was Chetyl Monblau, a 
candidate for Reve lle Se nior 
Senator, who won both Ihe original 
COUI1l and the recount. Referri ng to 
the Reve lle College Council's 
decision to not take part in the 
second election because the results 
of the recount and the original 
count were the same, Mo nblatt felt 
the Electi on Committee should 
have done the same in her case , 

"I won fair and square," said 
Monblatt , and wh ile displaying 
good g.-ace in accepting the 
Committee's verdict she said she 
felt the decision was "inconsis-
tent." "I don't agree with what they 

did ... Ibut l I'm going to go ahead 
and run , and I feci confident I can 
win again ," 

Ironicall y, it was Monblatt's 
opponent, Claire Mollard , who 
'called lor the recount. and she was 
the only candidate in the three 
close races tha t lost clgain . 

The MuirJunior Scnatorcontest. 
between Stacey Bowman and 
Jeanne Gobby. was reversed after 
the reco~nt , Initially Bowman h~d 
won by lour votes. but she was later 
lound to have lost by two. Because 
this is well within the five percent 
limit set by the Election 
Committee. the candid.lIes will 

Presidential candidates, March ck (top I.) , Weiss (top r.), Friend 
(bot. \.) and Morton (bOt. r.) start over due to invalid results , 

once more run for ollice. 
A drastic turndround tn the 

Presidential race was the cause or 
Eric WeIss's distress. R'\ther than 
slipping past Dave Friend \l) gain a 
spot in the run-oil election, he 
dropped to third place and it was 
Friend who was eligible for the 
fi nal wntest. 

WClSS said he "lound it a bit odd 
that they arc not doing evctythlllg 
over." and fci t it was the "very least" 
the Commi ttee could do. However. 
he feels Ih,1[ everything that has 
occured has benefitted him in the 
long run . and people will 
undersland what he called his 
" h o ne s t , s traightforward 
ampaign ." 

The second highest vote getteri n 
the recount, Dave Friend declared 
he was very happy with the 
outcome . "I have very little 
resources and very little time. but I 
feci my chances arc good. 

"I ran an unaurJctive campaign 
Ithe first lime !. but I'll have a more 
coherent campaIgn this time." 
Friend said . 

While Marchick gathered 
approximately 25 percent more 
votes than his opponents, he mUSt 
still run in next week's election. He 
feels this is unfair. "I think I got the 
worse 01 the whole thing. cxcept 
for Cheryl Monblatt," Marchick 
contends. 

Mdrchick i s the o nl y 
Presidcntidl candidate who is not 
changing hi s ca mpaign and 
believes he IS the "tdrget of "II three 
candidates I Friend . WeIss and 
WrltC-1Il Byron Monon l." 

While the reelection will nOt 
neccesitate the allocation ot runds 
lor ballOt printing and tabul.ltIon,lt 
will require some reve nue III cover 
publi ity and the Election 
Commlttee's extended duucs. ~

when at the same time it is gearing 
itself for a graduate school of 
international relations and pacific 
studies (Pacific Rim Studies), 
Wang stressed the need for such 
courses dealing with Asian -
Americans since It is these people 
who will most likely bndge the u.s. 
to Asia and the Pacific, 

"Ten years ago. I would not have 
emphaSized an Asian-American 
studies program ," Wang said, But 
because of the new wave of 
immigrants and th e fluidity 
(movemem to and from Asia) of 
th ese people. Wang feels that such 
a program is now a neceSSIty, 

" Caltfornia is c rUCial to 
International trade and Asian trade 
IS the fastest growing." Wang said. 
Wang emphaSized the importance 
of deViating from a totally 
eurocentric c urriculum . He 
questioned the quality of the 
prevailing undergraduate 
education being given , which is 
predominantly Anglo -S axon 
oriented. Therefore , Wang believes 
that Asian studies should also be 
included as a general education 
requirement and that these classes 
should not only be for Asians but 
for all students, regardless of race 
or ethnlcity. 

Wang feels thaI such classes Will 
also be th e answer to th e 
"movement away from dealing 
with racial problems: such as the 
60 percent increase of Violence 
agalilst Asians. "In her hiStory. 
America has always had racism 
having a major role in her society." 
Wang said. Through ASlan -

Notes from the underground 
Notes (& asides) of Buckley 

Dear William F.: 
! have been told by a couple 

university representatIves that 
your agent tried ferociou ly hard to 
dbcourage your UC 0 pursuants 
from upping the ,\nte for your 
appearance here [Onlghl. You did 
not exactly WIggle in your loafers 
when your were offered your 
normal five-figure sum LO come 
and preach to San DIego the 
wonders of Anglophilta - or is 
that Western Clvlltzatton? I can 
understand your hesitance Mr. 
Buckley, for if It was I who pnnted 
dlsinforrnation about the lUdent 
populatton of the univerSIty for 
whom I was requested to speak LO, 
reflecttng on current comenuons I 
suppose, then I mIght be apt to 
hIghtail to a more cordial 
atmosphere. 

orne mIght say that your 
bravery IS half-baked, Bill, tha t 
merely repnnttng false informatton 
from the Accuracy in Academia 
(AlA) propaganda manual, Campus 
Report , about twO conOlctua! 
incidems that occurred at UCSD in 
1985 between political actiVIsts 
and a couple puppet figures from 
the RIght In a eptember Issue of 
your bab}' rag, Natwnal ReVIew 
(, R). IS not enough LO nle up a 
h ISlOrtcally gullible Southern 
Caltfornla audIence . I WIll dissent 
from thIS opInion, though , BIll. For 
t[ IS my expenence as a Journaltst , 
and as an occaSIOnal publtc 
speaker. that when you offend an 
enltre host co mmuntl}' b; 
publtshlng elaborate falsehood 
dbout twO of theIr most memorable 
e"ems - the UCSD appearances 
o f South Afn cdn ArchbIshop 
Desmond Tutu and former contra 
fIgurehead Anuro Cruz - you run 
the rtsk of beIng publtcdlly 
S orned. 

Mr. Buckle y, since you are 
worldly renowned for both your WIt 
,.II1d hdughty ego, I gather that you 
wouldn't mind If [ tndulge our 
dudlence In a recapitulation of 
NatIOnal ReVIew 's and AlA's 
desCrt ptton of those two events at 
UCSD, and also LO highlight some 
of the more notable viewpOints 
printed in your magazIne, along 
with citing a few moments from 
your pamally forgotten past. 

NalLonal Re\~ew, back tn theIr 
September "campus" issue, saw It 
as thei r duty LO take a number of 
ha teful SWIpeS at "leftist" student 
agitators attendIng many 

cherished tn titutlOn!> 01 hIgher 
learn Ing. Dc cribll1g the DesmonJ 
Tutu II1cldent - where the 
Llnattcal, pro-"pJltheld , el'.lI1geitst 
minister Brother Jed -mock b,lIted 
community members eXIting from 
Tutu's highl}' insplratton.ll talk 
wtth such racIst 51 g.lns .IS "bl" ks 
In Afnca have shown th.lt they .Ire 
not capable of ruitng themselve "; a 
s uffie ensued between jed and an 
enraged off-campus man - the 
NR, using AlA mdterial provided [0 
them by the California Review, 
described jed as " "anti -
divestment activist , who was 
kIcked, sLOmped , and beaten ," by a 
large crowd of pro-dIvestment 
student actiVIsts. This completely 
contradicts nearly a ll the 
eyewitness accounts of the 
incident that were taken by the 
former Dean ofThlrd College, and 
much of what was contained in the 
twO poltce re ports fI led for the 
purpose of prosecuting a student 
on the charge of "lynching," which 
was la ter dropped. 

The second incident that gained 
nattonal prominence counesy of 
the NR was the extremely vocal 
opposition to Arturo Cruz's 
activities as contra dupe and 
parrot of the Reagan Adminsltnl-
lion's poltcy toward NIcaragua. 
Cruz , speaktng inSIde of a l.lrge 
tent outSIde of the Institute of the 
Am e rt cas , heard }'ells and 
drumbeats from a crowd tandtng 
100 feet outSIde of the pavl!ton 
eveI'}' time he uttered one of hIS 
confused postllons on the Central 
Amencan connic!. Cruz gave his 
entire speech however, and also 
took questions from the dudlence 
for one-half hour follOWing hIS talk. 
But the AlA report in the NR 
claImed that -Cruz was shouted 
do I'm and drowned out by a crowd 
of pro- andll1lSta symp.lthlzers." 
That IS SImply manure. for .Ill those 
InSIde the tent, except for those 
WIth heanng problemns, were able 
to hear Cruz's sweaty speech. I was 
standing in the very back and was 
able to catch everything Cruz said. 
The only time a problem arose was 
when the audience, who were 
without mIcrophones, began to 
drill h im WIth questions. It was at 
that time the protesters were made 
aware of Cruz's difficulty with 
heari ng the questions, and q'uickly 
pIped down . 

Alas, Bill, your magazine didn't 
care to check the facts, dnd ended

A few William F. Buckleyisms 
By passing Congressional sanctions against the South African apanheid 

regime: "We have almost guaranteed that the anti-apartheid movement within South 
Afri ca will now slow down . We have got to keep reminding ourselves that we live in an 
age where Kamikaze devotion to the state is quite common. " 

.... 
"The democracy of universal suffrage is not a bad form of govern ment; it is simply not 

necessalily nor inevitably a good form of government. Democracy must be justified by its 
works, not by doctrinaire affinnations of an intrinsic goodness that no mere method can 
{egitimately lay claim to . .. The commitment by the Liberals to democracy has proved 
obsessive, even fetishistic." 

.... 
"Aid given to famili es with dependent children can be considered philanthropiC, but 

we should know that the average annual payment to mother-and-child in cash is about 
$4,000. Th e creation oj one illegitimate child followed by a trip to the AFDC office is at 
the federal level alone is an imposition of $4,000 on one's neighbors." 

Concerning the controversy th:f"a!sf during Senate hearings over Judge 
William Rehnquist's nomination for chief justice of the US Supreme Court -
Rehnquist was alleged to have unlawfully harassed black voters in Arizona 
during the early sixties by demanding that they take literacy tests before voting: 
"For absolutely unfathomable reasons, we have not seen Mr. Rehnquist 's champions 
make the paint, nor has he himself made it, that up until we discovered Pure Democracy 
in 1964, we used to insist that people who voted should also be able to read and write. 
Under the circumstances, it was not an act of harassment to hold up a piece of paper 
with , let us say, }oh n hit the baseball' written on it, and to ask the aspirant voter what 
was written on that piece of paper. "

religion and individu,lli sm" in the 
unlvc rs lty. You wanted Ame rica t(1 
return to traditiollal, Chrlsttan 
values. and went so 1M as to Join 
the CIA la te r on to prove th.lt 
Christian values even have a place 
in an agency of murder. 

By co ndemning all libe ra ls and 
communists to hell fo r theIr 
despoiling of America, you were 
promptly assailed by scores of 
critics. Your written assassination 
of Itberdl fJcuIty teaching method 
at YJle, Jnd your demJnd for a 
tr.ldlli onal curri culum to be 
re m muted there, were sa id by 
Robert Hatch to be "precIsely those 
that arc employed In Genn.lny, 
Ita ly and Russia_ An eli te shall 
establtsh the truth by ukase, and no 
basic clt sagreemem shan ever be 
mle rated ." That beltcf was likewise 
fbr your hero McCarthy. and his 
verbal hltman. lawless lawyer Roy 
Cohn. Mr Cohn , it is commonly 
said , personally destroyed more 
lives in his lifetime than the IRS 
does in a century_ That isn't a giant 
concern for you. though , is it. Mr. 
Buckley] For in an obituarial 
tribute thaI you paid to Cohn last 
August. you assured the world that 
"the probability is high that, after 
due monification, he will make it 
through those I Pearly I gates _ .. . " So 
y('u read the mind of God , Bill; why 
thar's qUite a tale nr. 

Let us go on, WiUial.1,tosee how 
you apply your godly knowledge. It 
has been said that you view 
communism as the ami-christ and 
its supposed representatives as 
"incarnations of evil." For example, 
an NR editorial had th is to say 
about Nicaraguan President Daniel 
Ortega's last trip to New York, "For 
obvious reasons, political and 
theological, Cardinal O'Connor 
refused to meet with the most 
recent avatar of old 666." That 
seems JUSt a teensy bit overboard 
for the President of a nation that 
just recently inscribed God into its 
constitution. That kind of 
'language, however, is quintessen-
tial Buckley and National Review. 

I must close soon, Bill, which I 
regret very much. for I haven't the 
space to discuss your work for 
Ri chard Nixon a nd Ronald 
Reagan . Nor have we had a chance 
to expound upon your back pats to 
members of thejohn Bireh Society 
during the 60s, or your support for 
various right-wing military regimes 
,Icross the globe. But since we have 
discussed the anti -semitism of one 
of yo ur NR editors, j oseph Sobran, 
in these pages before , let me close 
by citing his opinions on the 
Howard Beach scandal and Afro-
Americans in general, "Bill Buckley 
tries to restore perspective by 
pointing out that a c!,)untry whose 
favorite T.V. program is The Cosby 
Show' can hardly be called ·mcist.' 
I'd go further. Cosby appeals to 
white America's noswlgic affection 
for an endangered species - the 
vJ nishll1g Negro. He's what we 
thought we were going to get by 
pass ing CIVIl-rights laws, and wh,1t 
we WIsh to hell we'd gOllen ."

Cola-corne-lately tastes 
the sweetness of success 
By ROr ... r LEONE, Staff Wnter 

T HE way C). Rapp tells it, he was going to be a marketing major in college , but his 65 
page dissertation on the 
distribution and marketing of a 
new softdrink received an F. He 
switched to political science, but 
his thesis generated the plans for 
the creation of Jolt Cola, which is 
currently "in some markets the 
third best- elling soda," according 
to Rapp. Even in a market where 83 
percent of an sales are for Coca-
Cola or Pepsi Cola products, Rapp 
says that the company "cannot 
keep up with the demand: 

In a recent interview, Rapp said 
that there were three reasons why 
Jolt is so easy to sell . In pan, It'S the 
I slogan: "All the sugar and rwlce the 
ca ffeine ." It's a qualiry product and 
competitively priced in a market 
that is seeing the end of product 
loyalties, according to Rapp. He 
also said that "sodas aren't meant 
to be a health food " This is a rather 
surpnsmg statement in an industry 
that grew from the os tensible 
"health-gi Ving" properties of 

carbonated spnng W,Hers 
What'~ 111 Jolt , any\Vd; ] rhe cans 

dnd pIa tic bottles that sa)" "All the 
sug,lr and rW lce the caffemc" 
cOn t,lln thc 111,I XIITIU m leg,t1 
amount of carieinc. Jolt Col" 
worked for years With the FDA on 

the composition of the soda whl h 
is sweetened entIrely by cane 
sugar, not the "less expensive corn 
sweeteners," Rapp said . The high 
caffeine levels (71 .2 milligrams per 
can) are Ie s than you'd find in an 
over-the-counter caffeine tablet, 
whi ch weights in at 100 
milligrams. Rapp also said that 114 
flavor formulati ons were tested 
before the one In the bottles was 
chosen. 

The most interesting pall of the 

Jolt stolY IS the jolt company Ilsclf. 
Accordmg to advice by orne 
Industry profc slOn..\ls which Rapp 
so ltCHcd before statting jolt, the 
comp,m>' should not have been 
successful. Even now Jolt employs 
only fi ve people: beSides Rapp 
there tS ,I vlce-prcstdent In charge 
of operati ons. t\\'o salesmen and an 
o ffl e manager. All f the 
cmplo)'ees are long-time friends of 
Rapp. The soda is bottled b)' 
Independetll bottlers in the United 
tates and i distributed in -+3 

states and several Candadian 
provi nces by Independent 
beverage di mburors . Jolt IS 
distributed by Coast Distributing 
m San Diego, which also delivers 
Miller beer. jolt thus enjoys low 
starting and low capt tal costs and 
benefits from the pre-existing 
marketing contacts of rhe 
distributors. This has helped Jolt's 
rapid spread. However, this I scheme means that Jolt is usually 
sold only in stores. There are not 
Jolt machIncs or soda fountain 
d istribuLOrs - yet. 

Jolt does a lot of its advertising 
ovcr the radio, SInce thc product IS 
targetcd towards a young age 
group. The advcTTlsing focuses on 
the fun of soda. Rapp staled that 
pall of his purpose in introdUCing 
Jolt was "getting back to fun with 
soft drinks." Rapp is also working 
on a diet versIOn of jolt, where 
most (but not aU) of the sugar is 
replaced by allificial sweeteners. 

Another intcresting pall of the 
business, according to Rapp, is 
consumer feedback. It was this 
information that convinced him to 
sell jolt outside of Rochester, New 
York, where Rapp hvcs. Through 

Inc. 

the pleading of bar operdtors for 
massive supplies ofJolt, he learncd 
that peoplc were miXIng it with 
rum and calling the result 'Jumper 
cables." 

And how well docs Jolt live up to 
its name? In a deliberately 
unsupervised tesl, a 150 lb. non-
caffeine-drinking volunteer drank 
rwo cans ofJolt In the space of an 
hour and was still wired six hours 
later, collapsing only after typing 
the bibliography of a 30 page term 
paper. Cj. Rapp should be proud. 
By the way, his dissellation, the 
one that got an F, is framed in his 
offIcc. ~

Rugby 
season a 
success 
By ALICIA AGOS 

BEFORE anyone really reahzed what was going on, the UCSD men's rugby club 
turned IntO a winning team. 
Sh\lffied out to nowhere, to an arca 
known to virtually no one as Mile 
High Ficld , the team won their 
championship and , with only thc 
Afumni game and the Montererry 
Tournament still to llay, has

Padres in 
need of 
pitching 
By MIKE MARTINEZ 

Irdn has got nothing on Sdn 
Diego. It's the Padres who Me 
desperately It1 need of drms. 
Fun c tioning, major league 
pitching .IrITIS. 

Coach Tom Butler admits that 
the secret of his team's success has 

be~n , In pan, "our conditioning 
program. It has been much harder 
this year and our players have been 
pushed to a better level physically." 
A surprisingly low .number of 
injuries enabled UCSD to beat 
some of the top contenders, 
namely the perennial league 
champion, Loyola. 

The Rugby Club was tough on its opponents this year, winning the league championship. 

On Monday night at the 
Stadium, Padre pitching arms were 
thrdshed by the San Fmncisco 
Giants 13-6. An anxIOus opening 
night crowd of ovcr 48,000 saw the 
Pads stall the game wi th a major 
league rccord three consecutive 
home runs. but thc shots were in 
vain as bdd pttching surrendered 
thc gamc. 

Last weekend, the Tritons 
travelled nonh for the infamous 
Santa Barbara Tournament; a 
weekend whIch was, according to 
Buder, "anti -climactic after we won 
league . Our la t game, a makeup 

against Irvine, took a lot out of us." 
2-3 for thc lOurndment, UCSD's 
highpoint came with Sunday'S 
victOry over powerhouse UCLA 

This year Butler worked with a 
team whose personalities "mcshed 
well. They were a lot tighter on and 
off the field, SOCializing together, 
more so than in past years." 
Assistant coach Paul jackson, new 
thiS year, proved to be an asset in 
terms of his extensive work with 
the backl inc. Club president Josh 

Weil "did a lotofdinywork on and 
off the field," said Butler. "Our 
whole season was definitely a team 
effort, but josh contributed a lot, as 
did Adam Ledkoff (Troll ), 
especlaly to the backline." 

The field dealt to the team is an 
obscurc one. Mile High Field is 
shrouded in secrccy way out by the 
Super Computer. Butler has plans 
for his program 's furure , pdn of 
which Includes a move back to 

Muir Field . "!t's sad that after 18 
successful tntercollegiate years, 
rugby was dropped . We got the 
lights taken out from under us. I'd 
like to sec more monetary support. 
The thing is thatwc're dealing with 
student athletes, emphasis on 
athlete. We could do a lot of 
fund raisers and all that stuff, but 
that cuts into srudy time. I'm 
hoping that the administration can 
come through for us because I know 
the money IS there ." !ill 

After tryoutS in San Francisco 
and Cinclnnatti , new manager 
Larry Bowd premicred his baseball 
rcvue for the homc fans. Americas 
Cup righthander Dennis Conner 
threw OUt the first pitch - and 
should have stayed in the game. 
Pddrcs Andy Hawkins, Dave 
Dmvecky and Tom Gorman were 
culled for 9 earned runs in all. Only 
Crdtg LclTersts pitched well , for I 
dnd 1/3 innings. Then Bowa was

SPORTS 

A.L. West 
Continued from page 9 
fini shes second last ycar. And whilt 
scares me is that this is a young baU 
club. They just might stay like this 
for a long time! First, the pitching 
staff. Three young staner namcd 
Bobby Witt, Ed Correa and jose 
Guzman were 33-28 with 174, 189 
and 87 strikeouts respectively, but 
had a big problem with a little thing 
called control (41 wild pitches by 
Witt and Correa a lo ne . ) 
OITensively, they have another 
swingin' rookie of the batch of 
1986, Perc Incaviglia. With a little 
more experience , the young 
Ranger staff will be a definite threat 
in rhe American League West. 

The Chicago Wh ite ox bombed 
out last yea r. They JUSt didn 't have 
the power or the pitching. Bur Jim 
Fe rgosi , the Whire Sox manager, 
plans to change aU of that. He still 
has veteran talent to work with. 
Harold Baines, Ozzie GuUen and 
Greg Walker aU ha~ poteillial for 
very good years. The pitching staff 
can rhrow very weU , much better 
than their tell-tale record of 72-90 
gives them credit for. As for their 
youth movement, rhei r greatest 
hope is in Ron I<arkovlce. He has 
all the 10015 for beeomlllg a 
successful catcher, both offensively 
and defenSively. A little expenence 
will help him make contact more 
often. If the littlc devil called injUry 
misses this team, the Whire Sox 
could be in it as well [his yedr. 

The Oakland A's, I mean, [he 
Duhlalld Athletics, under the new 
omm,lOd Tony LaRussa , arc 

hopmg for a real turnaround thiS 
year. They've broughl back Vida 
Blue and Reggie Jackson from 

yesteryear 1 hey've brough t 
Dwayne Murphy dnd Jdy HOlVell 
from the disabled list. And they've 
brought Roy Hobbs olT the Silver 
Screen as th e 1986 rookie-of-the-
year j ose Canseco. They are 
hoplngjoaquin AnduJdr dwdes to 
be wonh whatthey arc paying him. 
They also hope Cun Young is as 
ctrcctive a staner as la st year after 
being called up in May. As lor 
youth, weQ, we alreddy know about 
Canseco. This year, the Athletics 
have found infielders Rob Nelson 
and Mark McGuire. Both showed 
good power in the minors but still 
necd thc expe rience . If everything 
goes according . to plan, the 
turnaround from thw 76-86 1986 
season may ju~t ~in Sight. 

The Minnesota Twins wcre 
. supposcd to be thc team to bet on 

thiS decade . Yet somchow, they 
haven't managed to get near a .500 
season since 1979. All the potential 
is still around . They were second in 
home runs behind the Detroit 
Tigers. And they earned two Gold 
Gloves form Gary Gactti at third 
and Kirby Pucke t in the outfield. 
Then again, their bullpen needs a 
definite overhaul and they need 
somc help behind the plate. Take a 
look at the numbe rs for the 
relievers: 5.84 ERA and a 
whopping 24 saves total! jeff 
Reardon from the Expos might 
give the TWinS a bit of a boost, but 
the bullpen is still a mess. The 
Twins will necd repeat seasons 
from Gae!!l , who, besides his 
Golden Glove, had career highs In 
homeruns (34), RBI's (l08) and 
avemge ( 287) and their latest star, 
Kirby Pucket (31 H R's, 96 RBI's and 
.328 batllng avemge), as well as a 
comebdck from Kent Hrbek plus 
mdJor renOVdllons With thelT 

pltchcrs to be a threat thiS yeM. 
Once Jg,un , thc Seattle Mariners 

should nor be ,\ threat in the 
division. Thc}' have ncver finished 
even ncar a .500 record . They have 
been rcb uildll1g since they beg,lI1 , 
without luck They traded aU thcir 
yo ung phcnomcnd aWdy. Do the 
names Danny Tandbull, D,lVe 
Henderson nr Spike Owen ring 
any bells.? Their pitching staff won 
d tlllal 01 67 games with an ERA 01 
4.65, 27 saves (13 belonged 10 the 
Los Angeles-bound Matt Young) 
Jnd 585 wdlks In the proccss. Mark 
Langston was the staff's only bright 
Spot with a leaguc leading 245 
strikeoul. Then again , he also hdd a 
4.85 ERA and 123 walks "" jim 
Presley supplied much of the 
lacking oncnse last year, as did the 
only decem remaining outfielder, 
Phil Bmdley (after Henderson and 
T anabull were kt out to greener 
pasture s) . In thc meamimc , 
anyone wanna buy a team? Ii]

will soar on the fortunes III Its arms. 
Gooo pitching cure s a ll)t of other 
ills. The Padres lInn 'r have it. The 
lack of .\ consistent power hiller 
also hurts, b~ause they CJny 
teams on their backs and deliver 
titles (Schll'lidt in '83, Guerrero In 
'85 arc recent examples). Outside 
of these factors , the prospects 
aren 't bad, and in some CdseS, very 
promiSing. 

The new guys - Kevin Mitchell 
(38), joey Cord (2 B), Stanley 
jefferson (OF), BenilO Samiago (C) 
- arc going to all be finc everyday 
players . Cora will hit .250,

BUD UGHT TEAM OF THE WEEK 
JEFF BABCOCK AND USA HUDSON 

This past weekend saw the 5th Annual Sunlite Beach 
Volleyball Classic put on by the UCSD Rec Department. After 
some relocation problems, the tournament was a great 
success as Jeff Babcock and Usa Hudson spiked their way to a 
convincing victory. It was an exciting day of volleyball as the 
32 participants waged battle on the sand courts of Del Mar. 
The competition was tierce. but Babcock and Hudson rose 
above the rest to capture the championship' 

Spuds and the rest of the Rec Department would like to 
thank all those who participated and made this year's 
tournament one of the best ever' 

range 
of 

·talent 

What a difference a year 
can make, especially if you're 
Bruce Hornsby and th e 
Range. Last April , when "The 
W ay It Is" was released, they 
were unknown. It took them 
six months to sell a half 
million copies before being 
discovered, and just one 
month to sell another half 
million. Now, after a year, a 
Grammy, a platinum album 
and a number one Single, they 
ha ve become one of the 
hottest ba nds of 1987, 
peadlining their own U.S. 
tour. Last Sunday night they 
made a stop at the SDSU 
Qpen Air Theater, playing to 
a near capacity crowd. 

The 90-minute show 
featured all but one song off 
"The Way It Is," as well as 
covers of old Dylan and 
Grateful Dead tunes. The 
beauty of the performance 
was in its simplicity. Nothing 
about the show was grand. 
The stage was barren and the 
lighting was soft. Hornsby 
himself was amiable with the 
audience without being 
overbearing. The tone of the 
show was light, and the crowd 
responded warmly to the 
small, simple sound. This 
style is perhaps what has made 
Hornsby, the 32 year-old 
Southerner, a su cess, earning 
him a Grammy for Best New 
Artist of 1986. 

In a time when music has 

taken a political turn, and 
artists have settled for nothing 
less than making grandiose 
social commentaries concer-
ning the horror of the world 
around them, Bruce Hornsby 
has kept things simple and 
basic. Born and raised in 
Willi a m burg, Virginia, 
Hornsby has brought to his 
music a smalltown feel and an 
optimism that is so sorely 
needed in rock and roll. In 
"The Long Race," a song 
about attaining one's goals, he 
sings: Ie's a long race/ If 1 try 1 
will surely finish / Ie 's a long 
race / If I ery I will surely win it. 

His optimism is innocent, 
but clearly not naive, as the 
songs off his debut album 
show. Raised in a town of 
increasing tourism , Hornsby'S 
songs reflect a transition in 
thought, a changing of 
attitude between the small 
town and the big city. His 
themes are fairly common 
(lost loves, growing up, etc.), 
but the honesty and 
straigh tforwa rd ness wi th 
which he portrays them is 
refreshing. In "Down the 
Road Tonight," he speaks 
starkly of his first experience 
with sex: They'd lau~h and 
point oue / this roadside erailer/ 
and say somerhin~ wild 's ~oin~ 
ovcr thl.'Te/ thtry said ",)hae ehey're 
doing/ Don 'e mean n()(hin~ to 
you now/ hut someday ie'll mean 
l.·"I..'ryehin~ . 

bv david forman 

He brought his wide-eyed 
optimism to the stage from 
the beginning of the show, 
when he opened with "Jacob's 
Ladder, " a song made famous 
by Huey Lewis, After a few 
songs, he joked, " If you're 
wondering why we opened 
with a Huey Lewis song, it 's 
because we wrote it, so we can 
sing it too." In Hornsby 'S 
hands, "Jacob's Ladder" rung 
with perseverance and hope 
without being lost in rock and 
roll: AliI want from tomoTT01.4'j 
is that it be better than today. He 
followed it up with "The Long 
Race," one of three songs tha t 
Lewis produced on Hornsby 's 
album. He then stepped awa y 
from his piano, picked up his 
accordian, and assumed 
center stage. Through a few 
faster songs, he struck some 
classic guitar poses that 
looked silly, hidden behind 
his accordion but it was all in 
fun, as he jumped on the 
drummer's block and waved 
the back side of his 6'4" 
stocky frame to the crowd. He 
pranced around stage, 
seeming to be in awe of the 
space that he had to work 
with. 

The strength of the show 
and of the band itself is its 
music. Though not yet as tight 
as several more accomplished 
bands, the Range played their 
own blend of jazz, blues and 
country, headed by Hornsby's 

mas terful piano work . 
Hornsby has said, " If we're 
trying to do anything with our 
music, it 's to crea te our own 
sort of area that we write tn , 
ou r own little world o r 
microcosm." Their work has 
paid off, and thei r sounJ is 
wonderfully distinct. Their 
instrumentals arc reminiscent 
of artists from Windham Hill, 
the first label to offer them a 
contract, and fittingly so, as 
new age music might be the 
most accurate description of 
thei r style. It 's definitely a 
sound for th e yuppie 
generation, who grew up with 
the piano-oriented rock of 
Elton John and Billy Joel. 
How many bands in the '80s 
can claim to have an acoustic 
piano as a lead instrument? In 
a way, it's a resurgence of an 
era gone by, but in an exciting 
sense their sound is new and 
filled with the hope of the 
future. 

The highlight of the show 
was their energetic version of 
"The Way It Is." While the 
rest of the band took a break , 
Hornsby entranced the crowd 
with a stirring jazz piano solo. 
The drummer returned to the 
stage to form a musical duet 
with Ho rnsby, purposely 
losing his sticks and using his 
head and hands to keep the 
beat. Hornsby con luded the 
five-minute introductio n with 
the familiar vamp that sent the 

crowd to their feet. The rest of 
the band joined in and did a 
rousing cover of the song. 
which made the album 
version sound pale by 
comparison. 

They kept the pact' up With 
"The Wild Frontler," <! small 
towner's impression of Los 
Angeles, and ended with "On 
the Western Sky," wi rh 
Hornsby returning to the 
accordion, jumping off stage, 
and walking amongst the 
people in the first few rows. 
Each member of the Range 
had his own solo: George 
Marinelli on guitar,Joe Puerta 
on bass, Peter Harris on 
guitar, and John Molo on 
drums, and they concluded 
with a masterful mix of jazz 
and rock. 

By the end of the show, 
with the audience cheering 
" Brooce, Brooce," they had 
estab lished themselves as a 
legitimate force in music. 
They showed that acoustic 
and electric instruments could 
play in harmo ny. and the 
audien e wa the o ne to reap 
the rewards. Perhaps their 
approach is more suited for a 
smaller club setting, but losing 
some of the intimacy is a small 
price to pay for b ringing su h 
energy and optimism to large 
publi attention. In their own 
way, Bruce Horn by and the 
Range reddine music a 
si mply music.

A dramatic taste 
If you need a change of 

cenery and you want to see a 
good play, try "A Taste of 
Honey" at the Deane Theatre 
in downtown ,an Diego. 

urrendy presented by the 
Gaslamp Qua rter Thea tre 
Compa ny, "A Taste of 
Honey" is an award-wi nn ing 
play by Shelagh Delany, 
written in 1956 when the 
author was 17 years old. 

The play, set in England, is 
about a young woman namt!d 
josephine and her relation-
ships with her mother Helen, 
Helen's husband Peter, a 
sai lor, and an artist. The play 
begins as Helen and Jo move 
into a new apartment in an 
impoverished neighborhood. 
The audience quickly 
be omes aware of the distance 
between mother and daughter 
as the two constantly bicker, 
first about the apartment and 
then about jo's ch ildhood. In 
the course of the pIay, Helen 

by nancy muntner 
marries her seedy, ri h 
boyfriend Peter Smith, and 
leaves josephine alone to fare 
for herself. 

Meanwhile, 10 had met and 
gotten engaged to a sailor 
named Jimmy. Jimmy is black, 
which Jo knows would upset 
Helen, and this becomes an 
even greater problem when 
she discovers she is pregnant. 
This all sets the stage for the 
young Josephine being forced 
to grow up fast. 

Rosina Widowson Rey-
nolds is excellent as Helen, 
always domineering and 
selfish as she tries to escape 
poverty regardless of her 
daughter's fate. Reynolds's 
performance was so strong 
that at one point, when she 
returns to seeJosephine after a 
period of months, there was 
an audible reaction from the 
audience in anticipa tion of the 
upcoming conflict. Nicole 
Bonsall also gave a very good

performan e as Josephine, an 
18 year-okl girl left alont! and 
pregnant in a slum. 

Two of the male characters, 
Walter Murray as jimmy and 
Don Loper as Geoffrey, Jo's 
close friend and roommate, 
were also portrayed well. Both 
men were able to exchange 
quick-witted dia logue withlo, 
and both were very likable 
characters. 

There wt!re, however, two 
problems with the play. The 
first had to do with the 
s tagi ng. Josephine spent ten 
minutes of the second act and 
other short periods of time 
throughout the play with her 
back to the audience as he 
talked to Geoffrey. It was 
realistic but also annoying. 

The second glaring problem 
was with j effrey Zerg, who 
playt!d Helen's husband, Peter 
Smith. He seemed less than 
professional next to the other

tried to upholJ an English 
accent throughout the play, he 
didn't come close. A far as I 
could tell, he was French-
I ri s h -English~Amcrican. He 
should have spent more time 
I istening to the other actors 
practice. 

Despite these two prob-
lems, the play was very 
entertaining, as we saw both 

humor and despair spanning a 
year of Josephine's life. The 
play opened April 9 and will 
run through May 30. 
Performances are Wednesday

Sunday at 2 pm. Tickets are 
$12 for Wednesday,

Meree unningham, a 
horeographer, i invariably 

linked with the word 
inn va tion and QfJant-,garJe. 
He ha made a nam' ~ r 
him elf through the year by 
exploring the boundarie of 
dan e; he ha redefined 
movement in dan e, and 
through this has been a major 
influen e on dance in the 
W estern world. 

Innovative · dance 

Martha Graham once said, 
" Merce wa made for the air." 
It wa in her mpany that 

unningham first began 
performing. He left in 1947 to 
begin perf rming a a oloist. 
It wa during thi time that he 
began his ollaboration with 
compo er John Cage. Hi 
company, having grown from 
ix to 15 dan er in it 34-year 

history , includes orne of the 
best modern dan er in the 
country. 

Cunningham has reshaped 
the whole notion of dance, as 
well as the public's 
expectations of what dance is 
supposed to be. He feels 
interpretation should be left 
to each individual. He is not 
inspired by music, as many 

horeographer are, but 
in tead reate his pie e in 
silen e. His dan ers may not 
even be expo ed to the ore 
until the a -tual pening 
performan e. The result at 
times is a strange en e of 
fragmentation, with no 
apparent onnecti n between 
the dan e and the und 

ore. His dan es ontain n 
narrative and no psy ho-
logical state, a nece sa ry 
element in previous modern 
dan e. 

unningham' collabo-
rati n with compo er has 
c ntinued to grow. He still 
collaborate with age and 
has added the names of 
compo ers su h as Takehi a 
Ko ugi and David Tudor; 
works of both men will be 
heard in the upcoming 
performance. Robert Rausch-
enberg, Jasper Johns and 
Andy Warhol are a few of his 
past costume and set 
designers. 

Cunningham no longer 

dan es in his old roles. He i 
now largely a choreographer, 
yet he still uses many of his 
earlier works in per-
formances. He hanges each 
of the various pieces in 
different ways, so that each 
performance takes on new 
aspects and images. He 
experiments with dance 
further by running two dances 

together, perf rming parts of 
one and then parts of another. 
When he does perform with 
his company, he is usually set 
apart, playing a fool or a sage. 

His upcoming performace 
in San Diego consists of two 
programs. The first show will 
consist of "Duets," 
"Channels/Inserts" and 
•• Pictures ." The second
