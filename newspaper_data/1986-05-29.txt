Why can'tJoe 
College write? 
By WENDY STERN, Staff Writer 

H ERE'S THE situation: It is Sunday night, and you poli sci term paper is due in precisely 14 hours. You sit, Walkman on one side of you and sunflower seeds 
on the other. You read the question. 

You read the question again , and the blank page on your 
typewriter stares back at you. "Well, what were the theories?" 
you ask yourself, beginning to flip frantically through your poli 
sci books for some shred of information that will help you to 
begin. 

Suddenly, you here a voice from inside, reminding you of 
something you had forgotten temporarily. "You are taking the 
class P/ NP, dope," the voice says. "Why worry about the 
theories? You only have to get a C- to pass." 

So on goes the Walkman, out come the sunflower seeds and 
just like that, you're in business. 

This situation should not come as a surprise; many students 
don't seem willing to put in the work required to produce an A 
paper. To stay up all night is for most, a common occurence, 
but a whole quaner's wonh of work can't often be done in one 
night The surprise usually comes when the paper comes back. 
The entire night was spent slaving over a C+ paper; to some 
this brings joy and to others, sorrow or anger. Either way, it 
makes no difference whether you are a poli sci major or a 
student taking the class P/NP for a GE requirement. The 

,/ standards of writing are definitely not "A" material these days.

Lessons in literacy 
A Los Angeles Times survey has now told us what we 

have kn0wn all along. On the whole, we UCSD students 
don't really care to know how to write. 

Our writing programs have demonstrated painful 
rigor in their grading standards, but the fear of poor 
marks has not produced precise written discourse, We 
continue to seek marketable skills, ones which will 
eventually afford us the greatest material benefits and 
social status, rather than learning those which will allow 
us to communicate and solve the tensions that exist 
within the world community. 

The drive to literacy is seemingly a thing of the past. 
Whatever prestige we formerly ascribed to the masters 
of written language has now been eclipsed by EFHutton 
advenising campaigns, evening Wheel-of-Fortune 
episodes and lockheed recruitment. We can balance 
our checkbooks, pick out simple words and manipulate 
electrical circuiuy, but we haven't any idea how to 
analyze the effects of our actions. 

This university is full of talented scientists. Anyone 
who has taken a Friday morning physics quiz knows 
that our young scientists have the golden bough in 
regurgitating facts and formulas. Unfortunately, those 
same bright physics and chemisuy majors haven't the 
slightest idea how to carefully and thoroughly criticize 
the ramifications of their own and their colleagues 
theories. By the time we finish a science class at this 
university, we know what works, we know what is true 
and what is possible, but we don't know how to choose 
what is best. 

Making decisions about the world necessarily 
depends on the ability to communicate. We must value 
communication and strive to develop its many forms . 
Clear thinking comes through mental challenge. And 
our best answers come from asking ourselves those 
questions which have no absolute answers. 

The burden for improving our writing and analytical 
skills lies with ourselves and with our teachers. It may be 
a long time before our economy appreCiates the value of 
rigorously studying the exchange of ideas, but as we are 
at the forefront of experimentation and invention, we 
must be responsible for making prudent judgments 
about the information we receive and the use we make 
of that knowledge. 

-Lauren Fresh 

It's now or never 
By PHIL WlLLON 

I 1'5 THE year 2001 - my 25th class reunion - and the UCSD Alumni Association is 
throwing a party. 

We come from near and far, 
arnving in our new BMW deluxe 
stationwagons and "classic" 1980 
Toyotas. In the new gym, on the 
new cam pus, we stand, sit, talk 
and drink amid blue and gold 
balloons and streamers. Archaic 
sounds of Bruce Spri ngsteen and 
the Police play in the 
background. 

The school's new chancellor 
bids us a warm welcome and 
asks us for money. He hands the 
microphone over to an agi ng 
woman in a navy-blue power 
suit. Why. that's Mary Rose 
Alexander, our old AS president. 
Remember her? She's a successful 
lawyer in some big eaS(em town 
and has three kids. We've come 
a long way, she says. The world 
is a bener place because of us, 
she says. let'S make it even 

YOU MAKE 
THE CALL! 
If you have an 
opinion we want to 
hear it. Call the 
Guardian at 452-

better, she says. Then she steps 
down . 

"I'll have another gin ," I tell a 
young student behind the bar. 

"Yes, sir," he says. 
"So tell me ." I ask, "what's it 

like being a student nowadays?" 
"It's all right I guess," he says. 

"A lot of drinking and studying 
and that sort of thing. How 'bout 
back then?" 

"Oh , gosh ," 1 l 0:: ply, "' can 
remember when ... " 

Remembering when. It makes 
me think about what our aging 
minds will remember about this 
place. AI Shenk7 TGs? A Tijuana 
jail? 

When you're pushing 50 and 
you Dump into an old college 
buddy, or you tell your kids (or 
grandkids) how it was in the 
good 01' days, what will UCSD 
mean to you then? It won't be 
the grades, or (he finals, or the 
papers - it11 be the times you 
had. That road trip to Las Vegas, 

your 21st birthday, ,Ieeping on 
the patio of Winnie Mandcla 
library and eating those special 
brownies. 

Much 01 the time we forget 
that. We forget that we're young. 
We're so busy working to get 
ahead that we lose what we 
already have. Before we know it, 
another year has come and gone. 

Twenty-live years trom now, 
I'll be 47, and I'll probably have a 
tamily and a steady job. When 
my life gets rough or boring 
I'll look back at the times I had 
here. 1 might not be a doCtor or 
a genius physicist or anything 
remotely respectable - but I'll 
always have the memory of t11ese 
paS( four years. 

So while I qUietly get drunk at 
my 25th reunion, 1 may nOt have 
the niceS( car or the most 
prestigious job - but rn 
definitely have a smile on my 
face. ~ 

Last Tuesday, the Guardian printed an opinion jrom Mary Rose 
Alexander and the UCSD Judicial Board. This submission was actually

Joe College can't write 
Continued from page J 

Why is it that when you think 
you have done well, you actually 
only did average, and vice-versa? 
You are in college and you would 
think that you have the 
necessary skilli to write a poli sci 
paper; you did graduate from 
high school with an "A" in 
English. 

The sad truth is that most of 
the college students don't know 
how to construct a term paper, 
and moreover, professors are 
reluctant to assign them because 
they know the pieces of work 
that are handed in will be 
pathetic. 

According to a study done 
here at UCSD in the 1981-82 
and the 1983-84 academic year, 
"more than half of the instructors 
aSSigned no writing." 
Furthermore , "only a small 
proportion assigned extended 
essays and only four research 
reports were assigned ." 

How can students leam to 
write well? For each college at 
UCSD there is a writing program. 
All four are constructed 
differently, but are designed to 
teach the same thing - how to 
write and express your ideas 
clearly. According to Jim 
Crosswhite of the Warren 
Writing program, the problem 
lies not in the structure of a 
paper; but "in having something 
to say." 

Students need to Originate 

their own ideas and analyze. 
This is the basis for the Warren 
Writing program, which is 
deSigned to encourage the 
students to take more risks in 
their writi ng. The reason the 
Warren Program is offered on a 
P/ NP only, according to 
Crosswhite, "is to encourage risk-
taking without the competitive 
worry of getting an A" It enables 
the student to experiment with 
their writing and to develop their 
&yle through a revision process. 

The Revelle Writing program 
is more severe. It is a six-course 
sequence 
designed to 
olTer 
"Intensive 
writing in 
university 
level 
expository 
prose." But 
the question 
is, are Revelle 
students 
learning more 
than those 
from the 
Warren 
Writing 
program, or 
for that 
matter, from 
Muir or Third 
as well? 

According 
to political 

science professor Donald Chisholm, 
the grades are about the same, 
regardless of the college writing 
program. "There seems 10 be a 
drift to the B-/C+ range, and it 
is due mainly to the fact that the 
students do not have the 
incentive to write." To add to 
this problem is that professors 
are also not mOlivated to assign 
papers. Chisholm said, "The 
incentive to grade papers is not 
there: This laek of incentive on 
the parts of both the students 
and the professors is the core of 
the writing dilemma. 

Of the four programs, the Muir 
Writing program is the one most 
troubled, and is undergoing 
structural changes. Its paS( 
structure consisted of T As 
teaching the class, with the ':lid 

01 undergraduate tutors, who 
assisted ill grOl~p discussions 
and conferencing. Over the 
summer in 1985, changes were 
made which essentially placed 
more of the teaching 
responsibility on the shoulders of 
the T As and less on the tutors. 
Recently, the tutor program has 
been terminated. 

The tutor-tutor' program 
(LitlWriting 195) was being 
taught by Ken Mendoza of the 
Muir program, in addition to 
being a TA for the required 
classes. Originally, this class was 
funded by the Muir Writing 
program since it was the 
program requiring the tutors . But 
every quarter the enrollment was 
under average and the funds for 
the program had to be cut. 

According 
to Michael 
Davidson of 
the 
LitIWriting 
department, 
"The 
administration 
decided that 
if courses 
were to be 
offered 
through the 
literature 
department, 
then the 
literature 
department 
would have to 
pay. Since it 
had been 
relying on the 
writing 
program to 

Thursday, May 29, 1986 5 

teach the course, it would cost the 
literature department 
approximately SI5,OOO to 
$20,000 more for people to teach 
the course." 

Lack of incentive and abilities 
on the parts of students has 
reached the point of desperation . 
Students are getting discouraged 
with slaving over papers which 
are destined to earn only a C+, 
no matter how much time is 

' spent on them. From this 
frustration stems the greedy need 
to gain an A. rather than to learn 
how to earn an A This greed 
includes plagiarism, a rising 
problem, which can not oAly fail 
a student from a class, but is also 
cause to terminate a student's 
education at this and most other 
universities. The trend towards 
plagiarism includes copying from 
books, as well as stealing 
another'S paper, making a new 
cover page and handing it in as 
your own . 

Do students want to leam to 
write? According to Chisholm, 
there is a definite percentage 
breakdown . "The students pick 
the courses for definite reasons. 
Fifty percent don't want to work; 
they are close to the beach and 
don't want to be in the class (i n 
Spring quarter). 30 percent take 
the class because the time is 
convenient and the laS( 20 
percent want [Q take the class, 
but don't have the skills [Q do 
well." 

Whether it is lack of incentive, 
lack of funds, or lack of interest, 
writing is stiD one of the most 
tools that one can have. ~

Deuces wild as UCSD golf 
and Weishan finish second 
By GUS SANTOYO. Cutl tl1butmg Eel,tor 

T HE GOLF GOO at the 'CM DIVISIOn III championships serm !O have an omnipresent frown wh en UCSD's Pat 
Weishan is concerned . Last year, Weishan tied 
Bnan Goldsworthy of Pella , Iowa after the 
regulation 72 holes, but lost out on the national 
tide in a sudden death playoff. Weishan was this 
year's favori te to win the championships held at 
the Fox Hill Country Club in Wilkes Barre, 
Pennsylvania. 

But in a match ma rked with controversy, 
Weishan lost the title once again to Eric 
Meerback of the Worcester (Massachusetts) 
Polytechnic Institute by one stroke. UCSO as a 
team also came in second behind Cal State 
Stanislaus. a pe rennial golf powe rhouse that has 
won nine out of the last twelve team titles in 
Division III . 

But for Weishan, any hopes of winning the 
tournament may have been dashed on the 
seventeenth hole of the last day. The vociferous 
Meerback had antagon ized the other golfers in 
the tourney by statIng to the press that he was 
the best golfer in the field and that his under par 
scores would easily win the tournament, and 
accordIng to Golf coach Michael Wydra, 
Meerback had become the "laughing stock of the 
whole tournament." 

Although Mee rback led the field , his scores 
were steadily above par, and Weishan was wcll 
Within striking distance , only down by twO when 
the Silcnt Putt at Seventeen occured. NCAA rules 
state that if a player grounds his putter behind 
the ball and the ball changes pos it ion, even If 
the ball isn't touched, then it counts as a stroke. 

r-------------, 
Student Specials 

Meerbnck wa putt ing fo r bogc)' when thiS 
happened. 

"I saw the ball move," sa id Weishan . 'You 
could sec the Tides! label on hiS baU and then it 
moved to 'the side. The baU dclinitely changed 
positions." 

Wydra was also there when it happened. but 
no am ials saw the incident. "I saw it happen, 
Stanislaus' golfer, Pat, and three other kids saw it 
happen," sa id Wydra. "Golf enique tte is set up so 
that if something of this nature happens, you 
penalize yourself. After the e ighteenth hole, he 
denied it happened and he signed his card. At 
this point if anything was proven, then Meerback 
would have 10 be disqualified. The Stanis laus 
coach told his kid to keep qu iet because it 
wouldn't look good after they had won it all. It 
was one persons's word against another's and we 
lost out. " 

Ironically, the same th ing happened to UCSO's 
Brad Ste rl ing, who ended up chargi ng himself 
with an extra stroke. 

The team scores as a whole resembled a 
rollercoaster ride. They we nt from being fifth on 
the fi rst day 10 second in the 2nd round, back 
down to fi fth after the th ird round, and then 
with a fi nal surge finished ten strokes behind 
only Stani slaus. Besides Weishan, JOOSt 
Steenkamer. a fre shman from Holland ended up 
as the 10th best player in the nation and second 
team All -American. Wydra had high praise for 
Mike O'Laughlin , senior caption of the tcam, 
"Mike played real strong and worked real hard 
and there 's no way we would have done as we ll 
as we did without him." ~

What is the Budman's 
True Identity? 

Have you ever wondered who.that all-
knowing ommpotent Budman is? The guy 
is just amazing. How he can know so much 
and never be seen or heard by anyone 
befuddles rhe masses My goodness, righr 
here on the UC D campus we have our 
own version of upennan-C1ark Kent. The 
most asked quesllon on campu is, "Who 
is the Budman?" 

Well all you fairhful Budman followers, 
th day you have been wailing for ha finally 
arrived. It's time that rhe most loved and 
cherished characrer on campus graces his 
presence [0 UCSD. 0 much of a 
commotion has been made over rhe 
Identity of rhe Budman that we JUSt can't 
rorrure you aU anymore . 

ext Fnday, the day of the big T.C., 
yours truly wtll Visit his favome 
establishment and drink a cold brew wilh 
all of you. Thar's right, the Pub is the place 
to be . Dnnk a brew. shoot the breeze , rell 
the Budman how great your team really is. 
He won'r bite. He may even buy you a beer. 

But always remember The Budman is

Can you remember when 
you were a kidr You say you

entitled "Dr. Seuss, Then and 
Now," and until you see it,

Dr. Seuss will revitalize

Perhaps the most amazing 
thing about the Dr. Seuss 
exhibit, is that you can go, and 
I ok at all of tht: different 

The people who come to 
see the exhibit look like your 
typical museum frequenters . 
They're dressed up fairly 
nicely, and they all have an 
intellectual, analytical air 
about them. But when you are 
drawn over to whe\'e the 
exhibit is scn:eni ng some clips 
from the Scuss television

critics is sitting in a ring on the 
floor, laughing out toud and 
pointing, smiling at their 
favorite characters. 

However charming the 
works of Dr. Seuss may be, a 
careless observer might label 
them "kid's stuff" or just 
plain silly. But there is, as they 
say, "a method to his 
madness." 

Theodor (Dr. Seuss) Geisel 
said : "Nonsense wake up the 

brain cells. And it helps 
develop a sense of humor, 
which is very important in this 
day and age. Humor has 
tremendous place in a sordid 
world. It's more than just a 
matter of laughing. If you can 
see things out of whack, you 
can see how things can be in 
whack." 

Seuss' style breaks from 
most 20th century cartoon-
ing. "Out of whack" is a good 

o 

way to describe it. Everything 
he draws is unmistakeably 
fantastic, but even the mos\

anything about cats that a cat

statements of the obvious run

such a book because of their

it becomes obvious that when 
our culture gained a Pulitzer 
prize-winning children's 
cartoonists, we lost what 
could have been a hugely 
influential political cartoon ist. 

The San Diego Museum of 
Art did a fine job of capturing 
a Seussian atmosphere. The 
path through the exhibit 
winds and dawdles, and is 
interspersed with strange, 
cloud-like arches. The walls 
arc occasionally painted with 
odd plants and strange, Seuss-
terrain . Flags and banners 
decorate what feels like a 
Who-ville parade as you walk 
through, and some of them 
have quotes which are vital to 
the understanding of the man 
behind the Sneetches. 

Further along the path, but 
still in the "Then" part, are 
displays of his children's 
books. And even though you 
still see the little history 
blurbs beside the displays, 
you can forget about your 
intellectual pretenses. 

You read the fi rst phrases 
"And to think that I saw it on 
Mulberry Street," and you've 
lost it. You read the words a nd 
say the rhymes and remember 
what you learned by rote as a 
kid, and suddenly, you ' re 
runni ng to see Hor ton and his 
egg. You see the Lorax, who 
an hour ago you couldn' t 

recall, and you smile, and then 
grin, 'cause you remember it 
all! You remember the 
Sneetches, and rare Who-
Roast-Beast, so you laugh and 
you oggle; you don't care in 
the least. 

Dr. Seuss' inimitable charm 
carries you away, and before 
you realize it, time has drifted. 
The exhibit isn't remarkably 
long, but it takes a while to 
savor each of the books which 
were special to you as a child, 
and it is hard to bring yourself 

. back to the adult world: the 
"Now" of Dr. Seuss. 

His latest book You're Only 
Old Once (for obsolete children) 
is a response of 81 ~year-old 
Theodor Geisel to old age and 
the physical deterioration that 
com es with it . While he was in 
the hospital, he drew a lot of

the book to amuse him elf. 

He sketched what was 
happening to him (through 
the Seuss astigmatism, of 
course) and what fe ll together 
was a gloomy and convoluted 
(but not hopeless) portrayal 
of hospital examinations. The 
display of You're Only Old 
Once leverly leads you 
through the pro ess of making 
a book. And Dr. Seuss is 
there, explaining all of the 
stages and introducing you to 
a different world. 

You file out past the 
boutique where they are 
sell ing poster and probably 
all of the books Seuss has 
authored, and pass through 
the door into the bright 
sunlight. After being in Who-
ville for so long, it takes a 
minute to adjust your vision 
to the real world , and you 
realize with a sigh that you 
o nly have until July 13 to 
come back and see it again.
