UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO 

Panel Discusses the 
Role of Abortion in 
American Politics 
By CHRIS STEINS 
Staff Writer 

"The New Politics of Abortion" 
was the subject of the first in a 
series of public policy forums to 
be held at UCSD this spring. 

The panel was moderated by 
UCSD Political Science Professor 
Samuel Popkin and included Kath-
leen Francovic, director of public 
opinion surveys and a producer for 
CBS News, and William Schnei-
der, a political columnist whose 
syndicated columns appear in the 
National Journal and the Los An-
geles Times. 

The forum examined the role " 
that abortion issues may play in 
local, state, and national politics in 
the next two years in light of recent 
Supreme Court rulings. Panel 
members said the Supreme Court's 
decision in the Webster case last 
year, which effectively left the is-
sue of the legality of abortion to 
the state legislatures, has particu-
lar bearing on politics in years to 
come. 

The abortion issue's move to 
the forefront of politics means that, 
"for the first time in a very long 
time, the American public has to 
confront the abortion issue," Sch-
neider said. 

"Politicians hate the abortion 
issue. They don 't want to deal with 
it; they don't want to hear about it. 

They don't want people thru ting 
rusty coat hangers and bloody fe-
tuses in their offices," Schneider 
said. 

According to Schneider, politi-
cians "were praying the Supreme 
Court would reach a decision 
[which WOUld] take abortion off 
the political agendas so that politi-
cians would not have to deal with 
it." 

Instead, politicians are being 
forced to take a stand on the abor-
tion issue, and no matter which 
side they take, they suffer politi-
cally , he said. If politicians take 
the pro-choice side, they anger the 
right-to-li fe voters, and if they 
come out on the right-to-life side, 
they anger the pro-choice voters, 
he aid. 

"And if they try to waiver, or 
come out in the middle, or change 
their position ... then it becomes a 
character issue, and their oppo-
nents gang up on them and say, 
'What kind of person is this that 
listens to the polls and changes his 
views on a fundamental issue of 
moral principles?' So they're going 
to get in trouble no matter what 
they do," Schneider said. 

For the first time in a number of 
years, pro-choice voters feel threat-
ened. As a result, there i an 
"organized, threatened, angry 
constituency on the pro-choice side

Suspect Still at Large in Third 
Clairemont Slaying This Year 

Police urge residents to keep doors locked 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

As Clairemont residents locked 
their doors in fear of a possible 
serial killer, the San Diego Police 
Department said yesterday that the 
stabbing death of a young woman 
in Clairemont on Tuesday may be 
related to the similar murders of a 
UCSD student and a San Diego 
State student in the same neigh-

borhood earlier this year. 
The San Diego Police Depart-

ment (SDPD) identified the woman 
killed Tuesday as Holly Tarr, 18, a 
high school senior from Okemos, 
Michigan. She died from at least 
one stab wound to the chest, the 
coroner's office said. 

apartment complex with a friend 
Tuesday morning and returned to 
her brother's apartment at approxi-
mately noon, police spokesman 
Dorothy Powell said. Tarr' friend 
followed about 10 minutes later. 

The friend found the door 
locked, and apparently a resident 
called the apartment complex's 
maintenance man to let her in, 
Powell said. 

Revelle Proposes American Cultures 

The SDPD is searching for a 
suspect seen running from the apart-
ment where Tarr' body was found. 
A witness described the suspect as 
a5'S"blackmale in his late teens to 
twenties wearing a red T-shirt and 
black Levi's jeans. The suspect has 
short hair and is of medium build. 

The maintenance man, 58-year-
old Richard Williams, told the 
Guardian that he received a calion 
his beeper Tuesday afternoon re-
porting a problem in one of the 
apartments. " I thought it was a 
plumbing problem," he said. By PHIL GRUEN 

Senior StflllWrittr 
Revelle College's proposal 

for an American cultures 1"0-
quiremenl was approved by a 
23-6 vote at a Revelle faculty 
meeting last month. The pro-
posed requimnent now ~ 
the approval of the Committee 
on Educational Policy and the 
UCSD AcademiC Senate. 

The proposal, as approved 
by the ReveUe College execu-
tive Committee - consisting 
of students. faculty, and ataff-
states that "students will be 
required to take at least one 
course that studie$ ... the his-
torical , political, social, and 
economic forces that have 
haped the emergence of col-

lective identities in the United 
States." 

According to the proposal, 
the required courses would in-
corporate material des ribing 
and comparing two or more 
cultural group . 

The proposal !>tatcs that the 

cultural groups studied would 
··oot necessarily" all be in the 
United States. 

The courses would also be 
theoretical in nature, encour-
aging an "intellectual frame.. 
work" in order to analyze is-
sues of ethnicity beyond the 
specific exarriples of the class, 
accordina to the proposal. 

If implemented, the course 
would be required for all in-
coming first-year students in 
Fall Quarter 1991, and of all 
mfer Students beginning in 

Fall~l~.~riam 
Cultures would faU under 
Revelle's social science re-
quirement. In addition, all 
Revelle students would be 
required to take two courses in 
a social science sequence and 
one in American Cultures. 

According to Revelle Pro-
vo t Thomas Bond, the course 
will not add to the number of 
ocial science requirement at 

Revelle, but neverthele s will 
limit the student's flexibiltty 
in course "election. 

Bond, who has been push-
ing for the requirement, noted 
that it is important for students 
to learn how different cultures 
interact with one another. 

"There is a lot of ignorance 
about cultures out there ... .1 
want students to learn about 
cultures other than their own," 
be said. 

Though Bond admitted that 
rile requirement is not going to 
solve any global problems in 
itself, be described it as "a first 
step" ira that diroctioo. 

Reql.lirements similar to the 
Revelle proposal either exist 
or have been approved at other 
UC campuses including 
Berkeley, Riverside, Santa 
Cruz, Irvine, and Santa Bar-
bara. 

Berteley requires that ev-
ery student pa s a course fo-
cu ing on three different eth-
ni group chosen from a list 
that include the frican 
American, A ian American,

The knife used in the killing and 
a T-shirt the suspect wore over his 
head as he fled the scene have been 
recovered by police, SDPD Repre-
sentative Dorothy Powell said. 

The SDPD has given the mur-
ders "top priority," Powell said, 
noting that "the Homicide Depart-
ment has been given carte blanche 
to get investigators from any de-
partment they want." 

Powell added that detectives 
have aid there are " unmistakable 
imilarities" between the murderof 

Tarr and two other fatal tabbings 
of young women in the arne area, 
about five miles outh of UCSD, 
earlier thi year. 

The similaritie between the 
murder include the age. sex. and 
raceofthe victim, the proximity of

occurred (the afternoon). Powell

When he arrived at the cene, 
Williams saw the victim's friend 
trying to get into the apartment. He

behind the door. 
Williams unlocked the door 

with his passkey, and broke the 
drawn chain-lock by pushing on 
the door. 

"As I took a few teps in ide, 
someone with what eemed to be a

came to a point and appeared to be 
harpened on both side ," he said. 

William said he could only ee

UCSD, IBM Scientists Make New 
Advances in Information Storage 

Work by IBM scientists and theoretical modeling by 
researchers at ucsO's Center for Magnetic Recording 
Re earch (CMRR) ha contributed to a breakthrough in 
magnetic data storage density. 

IBM cientists and engineers announced in December 
that they had set a world record by successfully packing 
a billion bits of information onto a single square inch of 
magnetic di k urface, an infomlation density 15 to 30 
times greater than Ihe storage capacity of currently avail-
able computer hard disk drives. 

One of the advanced components required to achieve 
this storage den ity is a disk coating made of a low-noise 
metallic thin film. The development of these films played 
a key role in Ihe theoretical groundwork laid by Profes or 
H. Neal Bertram and postdoctoral fellow Jian-Gang Zhu 
al UCSO's CMRR. 

"We were producing interesting results in the lab, 
making progress on lower noise films ," said Ian Sanders, 
manager of recording materials at IBM's Almaden Re-
search Center in San Jose, Calif. "But we didn't have a 
really clear idea of what was going on in the structure of 
Ihe materials to give us the effects we were getting. Then, 
in about 1987. we came acro s the published work of 
Bertram and Zhu. It focused our ideas and, most of all, 
gave us confidence in Ihe direction we were going. We 
believe we would still have reached the goal. but our 
progress would have been slower without models to help 
explain what we were eeing and that began to predict 
what we were going to get if we altered our process. 

"Timing was the key." Sander continued. "Usually 
theorists are either behind or too far ahead to sync well 
with current experimental work. BUI Bertram and Zhu 
made good assumptions and good implifications in their 
modeling and came up with something very useful at just 
the right lime." 

CMRR was established at UCSO in 1983 as the first 
joint industry-university research effort outside Japan 
devoted solely 10 improving magnetic recording technol-
ogy. Bertram, a professor of electrical engineering and 
holder of an endowed chair at CMRR, believes the center's

A.S. Votes to Fund Recycling Program 
By MARY BETTY HEARO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S . Council unanimou Iy 
passed a bill requesting $ 1,000 in 
funding for the University Center 
Recycle Program last night. 

According to Evan Weisenfeld, 
marketing coordinator for the 
University Center Board, " UCSO 
uses 10,000 paper cups per week, 
and that's filling up land fills and 
usi ng up trees. Our solution is 
Precyc le Mugs [which are mugs 
thaI] will be sold from the Sun-
shine Store at $ 1.49 plus tax with a 

drink included ... Students will be 
able to get 10¢ off refills." 

Of the $1,000 funded,$500will 
subsidize the mugs and $500 will 
subsidize a Recycle Program. 

According to Weisenfeld, the 
program will increase recycling of 
aluminum, glass, and newspapers 
on campus. Recycling bins will be 
placed in the Price Center and more 
will be purchased for the Student 
Center. 

"The bulk. of the money we need 
is for the bins, and for getting the 
information [about the program] 
out," Wei enfeld sa id. 

The plan will also involve of-
fering the Precycle Mugs as an in-
centive to save on paper products. 
The mugs will be sponsored by the 
A.S., the University Center Board, 
and the University Bookstore; 
logos from each will be printed on 
the mugs. 

"What I'm asking for from the 
A.S. is co-sponsorship on the pro-
gram. By asking for help from the 
A.S., the University Center Board, 
and the bookstore, we want to bring 
down the cost of the mugs for the 
students, so that people will want 
to buy them," Wei senfeld said. 

ABORTION: Panel Discusses Issue's Effect 
Contin ued from page 1 
thaI is communicating their views 
quite effectively," Schneider con-
tinued . 

According to Francov ic, during 
gubernatorial campaigns in Vir-
ginia and in New Jersey, abortion 
became a major issue in 1989. 

About 10 percent of the Ameri-
can public describe them-
selves as single-issue 

approve of abortion, Schneider 
aid. 

According to Francovic, about 
20 percent of the American public 
think that women u e abortion as 
the primary means of birth control. 
and over 50 percent think that at 
least some American women prac-
tice abortion' as a means of birth 
control. Over 40 percent of the 

and is very sensitive to human 
rights. For the last 15 years abor-
tion has been defined for Ameri-
cans as a fundamental right, and 
many people now object to Ihe 
possible limitation of what they 
see as a constitutionally protected 
right, he sa id. At the same time, 
however, the United State is also 
one of the most religious societies 

in the world. 
voters - voters who 
would vote for a candi-
date based solely on the 
candidate 's position on 
abortion, she said. 

"Clearly, one out of 
every 10 voters can mat-

'Politicians ... don 't want people 
thrusting rusty coat hangers and 
bloody fetuses in their offices. ' 

" This is, essen-
tially , a conflict be-
tween faith and rea-
son .... The reason 
why it is so intense 
here, it seems to me, 
is that the culture of 
faith is very powerful 

-William Schneider 
ter in an election, and this 
public could decide a 
rather sizable number of elections 
down the road," Francovic said. 

The abortion controv ersy 
reaches the highes t levels of poli-
tics; not even President George 
Bush is immune. In January of 
1990, when Bush's approval rat-
ing was in the 70 percent range, his 
rating on how he was handling the 
abort ion issue was at 41 percent, 
Francovic said. 

According to Francovic, abor-
tion is an issue that makes people 
uncomfortable, and raises complex 
issues that are difficult for most 
Americans todeal with. Using data 
collected from national surveys by 
CBS television in the last year, 
Francovic said that most Ameri-
cans find the idea of abortion dis-
tasteful. 

According to Francovic, the 
largest determining factor in indi-
viduals' po itions on abortion is 
their"religiosity," orhow intensely 
the individual is committed to their 
religion. The religious denomina-
tion does not seem to matter so 
much as the intensity of the 
person's belief in the religion. 

Younger people, and those 
highly educated, are more likely to 

American public feel that abortion 
is murder, and about an equal per-
centage feel that abortion is not 
murder because the fetus is not yet 
developed. 

Vast majorities of the Ameri-
can public, however, think that 
there are acceptable reasons for 
abortion. Most people support 
abortion in particular cases, such 
as when a women's life is in dan-
ger or in cases of rape or incest, 
according to Francovic. 

Yet even for people who feel 
that abortion is always murder, 
about half of them feel that it is 
sometimes the best option in a bad 
situation, she said. 

"So what we have here is a 
general dislike of abortion, par-
ticular reasons that justify abor-
tion, and on a personal level, a 
number of people who will make 
an individual exception for the use 
of abortion," Francovic said. 

Questions were raised during 
the discussion as to why Ameri-
cans are unique in their under-
standing of the abortion issue. 

According to Schneider, the 
United States is one of the best-
educated countries in the world,

Lithuanian Independence 

Challenging Reforms 
The future of perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's restructuring 

of the Soviet political system, is hanging in the balance as the 
tension mounts daily in the Baltic republic of Lithuania. The 
development in Lithuania will cenainly not help "Gorby-ma-
nia." Clearly, Gorbachev is faced with a difficult decision. If he 
uses military force to bring Lithuania back into the union , he will 
shatter his global popularity and credibility as a icon of demo-
cratic refonns. If he does not, he faces the wrath of hard-line 
conservatives within his own government, who have been wait-
ing for an opportunity such as this one to force Gorbachev out. 

The secession of Lithuania provides a perfect example of just 
how ungovernable the Soviet Union has become. Soviet econo-
mi t Andranik Migranian wrote in a recent Los Angeles Times 
editorial that Gorbachev's attempts to modernize the stagnant 
Soviet system have succeeded only in "calling into question the 
legitimacy ofthe existing system," thus turning the Soviet people 
against their own government and rendering the present gOY rn-
ment unable to lead. 

Gorbachev's hopes to maintain and improve communism 
through democratic refonn were flawed from the beginning. 
Perestroika served only to complicate matters for Gorbachev by 
delegitimizing 70 years of Soviet political, social, and ideologi-
cal institutions without establishing new, legitimate institutions 
in their place. 

Lithuania's declaration of independence is proof that when 
people subjected to totalitarian rule are suddenly introduced to 
democracy, they will choose democracy and all of its freedoms, 
including the right to reject the government offering that free-
dom. 

Lithuania did just that, and, much to Gorbachev's dismay, 
many other Soviet republics threaten to do the same. Even now, 
Latvia and Estonia, Lithuania's Baltic neighbors, are considering 
motions in their parliaments to declare independence. 

The Ukraine, Soviet Georgia, and Annenia have expressed 
their discontent with Soviet rule for some time as well. It is only 
a matter of time before those republics go through the motions of 
secession. 

But the Ukraine is the breadbasket of the Soviet Union. Losing 
it would be an intolerable embarrassment. But if Lithuania is seen 
as the first domino, the first in a mass exodus of disgruntled ethnic 
republics, Gorbachev could be in serious trouble. 

Some people, including President Bush, would say that it is in 
the best interest of pragmatism to support Gorbachev in this 
critical hour of need - that, in the long tenn, supporting 
Gorbachev in his efforts to maintain the Soviet Union will bring 
positive results in U.S-Soviet relations. That may be true, but 
what is the purpose of being pragmatic if one does not have a 
vision of what the world should be? Apparently, Gorbachev's 
vision is not as clear as he thought. But even more apparent is the 
vision of the Lithuanian people to govern themselves. 

Whereas Gorbachev's refonns lack legitimacy in the eyes of 
the Soviet people, Lithuanian independence clearly has legiti-
macy in the eyes ofthose who count: the Lithuanians themselves. 

The Lithuanian people deserve our pragmatic support. That is, 
we must support Lithuanian goals while maintaining the voice of 
reason. 

Migranian writes in his analysis that, "in Lithuania, as well as 
in the West, there is often a desire to do too much too soon." Haste 
can often lead to an outcome directly opposite of that which is 
desired. Migranian wams that the entire Soviet Union, not just 
Lithuania, could end up "losing everything achieved by per-
estroika" if democratic refonns are reversed by this situation. 

The future of democracy is at stake in the Soviet Union. This 
is clearly Gorbachev's greatest test in his five years as the head 
of the Soviet stale. But for democratic refonn to truly mean 
anything, Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet, and the United States 
are going to have to accept the fact that Lithuanian independence 
is a reality. 

Women Face Discrimination From TAs 
Editor: 

We all know that there are 
complaints far and wide about this 
"in titurion" caned the Engineer-
ing Department. The issue at hand 
is that a lot of the complaints I 
have been hearing come from fe-
males. 

Their gripes mainly concern 
the TAs, although some profes-
sors have come up on occasion. I 
will not mention these names, 
since doing , 0 would jeopardize 
some of the individuals involved. 

Thecomplaint consist mainly 
of the prejudice they enCOlll1ter 
every time they go to class, sec-
tion, and lab. T As often doubt the 
integrity of the programs they 
write, questioning the ability of 
the student to write the program. I 
heard of one T A purposely de-
stroying a program with tests that 
the female program writers could 

have never guarded against be-
cause uch safeguards were never 
taught. 

Questions are discouraged, and, 
if a female looks, dresses, and 
speaks like a woman, then the rea-
soning behind her being in the 
engineering major is questioned. 
And this is not variable! It hap-
pens to a lot of the women in the 
department, and not just those I 
associate with. 

I don't have a clue as to the rea-
soning behind the bias. If women 
want to pursue the engineering 
major they should not be down-
trodden. lfthe men feel like their 
own positions are being threat-
ened, then the reasoning must lie 
in their own impotence. 

I'm not an engineering major, 
but I have lots of friends who are 
(who doesn't at UCSD?). I'm a 
biochemistry major, but seeing 

these people who are interested in 
pursuing a difficult, yet rewarding 
di cipline being stereotyped or 
biased against really pains me. 
What is the malter with these 
people (TAs and professors) that 
makes them think that God de-
signed only men to be engineers? 
Both men and women came from 
the same evolutionary lines, 
people! Allometry didn't nece -
sarily leave men with larger brains. 

To test this theory, I attended 
some of my friend's classes and 
labs. I was appalled! A sarcastic 
smile here, a mocking tone there, 
and that's all r needed to know. 
And a lot of the programs I saw 
that the women had written were 
as good as, if not sometimes better 
than, programs written by males. 

Gun Control Hypocrisy 

I'm not saying that all TAs and 
all professors carry this prejudice 
wi th them. All I'm saying is that 
there are enough of them that do. 
If microchips and structural de-
sign are your fantasy, and women 
make you feel the need to defend 
yourself, there is definitely some-
thing wrong with you. If you're 
not rounded out enough to include 
socializing along with your disci-
plines, then you need to think your 
life out because you will have to 
interact with those of the opposite 
sex, possibly more than you inter-
face with a silicon-laden, regurgi-
tation machine (your computer). 

Editor: 
The terrible tragedy in New 

York in which 87 innocent people 
lost their lives at the hands of a 
man armed with nothing more than 
matches and flammable liquid il-
lustrates rather forcibly that 
California's "assault gun law" has 
not reduced a person's chances of 
being killed by a crazed fanatic. 

Indeed, matches, cigarette 
lighters, gasoline, and other flam-
mable liquids are available across 
the counter to anyone with cash in 
hand, and without any waiting 
period or license! Yet a killer 
armed with these ordinary sub-
stances killed more people than 
all of the killers armed with as-
sault rifles combined! 

However, we have yet to hear 
from Handgun Control Inc. or the 
National Coalition to Ban Hand-
guns. Certainly, if they were as 
concerned with preserving inno-
cent lives as they are with having 
big government confiscate the 
guns of law-abiding citizens, 
wouldn't they be calling for the 
registration of cigarette lighters, 
banning the sale of matches ex-
cept to military or police, and li-
censing all buyers of flammable 
liquids? 

BENSON 

When will Senator Roberti and 
Assembly Member Roos intro-
duce legislation to "protect" u 
from crazies anned with matches 
and flammable liquid ? When will 
President Bush ban the importa-
tion of these substances? 

When will ordinary citizens 
wake up to the hypocrisy of all of 
these pressure groups, bureaucrats, 
and professional politicians who 
are so preoccupied with " protect-
ing" us at the expense of our con-
stitutional rights?

Article'Misquoted Howard 
Editor: 

In your article about my March 1 letter to the California Leg-
islature, you represented that I am seeking legislation to limit 
student fee-funded facilities. 

This is totally inaccuratt>. 
In fact. I am seeking to increase student control over the assess-

ment and use of student fees. 
I realize that your organization, and in particular the writer of 

the article which misquoted me, has been very supportive of the 
administration-initiated RIMAe facility, so 1 don't expect high 
standards of critical reporting from you on this issue. But I do not 
think it unreasonable lur me to ask that you do not put words in my 
mouth. PLease be more careful in the future.

Commentary 

The Associated Students: Inefficiency Does not Serve Constituents 
By MARY BElfY HEARD, Senior Staff Writer 

A student government like the 
ASUCSDCouncil houldworkin 
council meetings as any other 
group of adults working together 
to create a healthy, educational, 
and fair atmosphere: with objec-
tivity. efficiency, and respect for 
others. 

Unfortunately, the A.S. often 
lacks these qualities. Instead, they 
can be a collection of bickering 
students who refuse to listen to 
each other. 

Any group of elected officers 
is expected to have diversity in 
focus and background, causing 
debate. Fine; that is one of the re-
quirements of democracy. How-
ever, the debate should remain 
objective, or in other words, de-
void of personal feelings and preju-
dices. 

The present A.S. Council does 
not have this level of objectivity. 
Often times debate has been 
lengthened because of members 
bringing personal opinion and 
viewpoint into the discussion. This 
leads to anger and frustration, and 
nothing is accomplished. A favor-
ite phrase within the council is, "I 
am representing my constituents." 
Sometimes whether they are trying 
to or not is questionable. 

For example, debate over the 
appointment of Vanness Harris to 

a programming board became 
heated because some council 
members were concel'!'ed about a 
previous conflict between Harris 
and Programming Commissioner 
Matt Schnurer. Debate should 
have been based on whether or not 
Harris was qualified for the ap-
pointment and whether he could 
perform his duties in a fair and 
reasonable manner. Instead, the 
main concern was Harris' person-
ality, since he upset Schnurer. 

There is also a level of com-
petitiveness in the council , in that 
some of the members like to get 
the last word in. Bills and amend-
ments have been prevented from 
going to a vote (and thus delaying 
the discussion of other bills) be-
cause one or two members haven ' t 
had a chance to say what they 
wanted to, even though it may be 
repetitive or unrelated to the topic 
of debate. 

Unfortunately, some members 
display a general lack of respect 
for others both within and outside 
the council. There have been cases 
of racism and sexism; A.S. Presi-
dent John Ramirez once had to 
stand up and yell at the council 
because one member repeatedly 
recei ved notes with sexist remarks 
and written sexual attacks. There 
is also simple rudeness: interrup-

tions, speaking out ortum, ignor-
ing the meeting's chairman, and 
angry outbursts from frustrated 
members. 

The result of these problems is 
a poorly-functioning student gov-
ernment. The council is often slow 
moving because debates can go 
on for hours, meaning that other, 
possibly more important bills are 
cheated of the consideration they 
deserve. 

The council also seems to lack 
forethought. For example, after 
allotting $2,000 to the Sun God 
Festival Committee for fireworks 
without question, the cou ncil real-
ized that the budget was dwin-
dling and that they could not af-
ford much more. So when the 
Culture Quest Festival Commit-
tee wanted only $1,000 for fire-
works, the council denied the 
request. 

While the Sun God Festival is 
a tradition and always has fire-
works, the Culture Quest Festival 
could have benefited from the extra 
excitement fireworks would have 
added, because the festival is a 
new one. 

If the council had taken its 
budget into consideration a little 
earlier, the Sun God Festival would 
also have been denied the allot-
ment, because the council really

couldn't afford it. This would have 
simplified the decision of whether 
or not to allot money to the Cul-
ture Quest Festival for fireworks. 

These problems wi th in the 
council are not simply abstract 
ideas to which we can shake our 
heads at and say, "Oh well." They 
affect us. If the student govern-
ment does not function well, that 
means that many of the decisions 
are poorly made. Rather than 
benefiting us, the decisions are 
hurting us. 

Please understand, not all the 
A.S. members are like this; some 
are trying their best to work with 
the others. And the council has 
done some good things during its 

term. But the problems are there, 
and they do reduce the council's 
effectiveness. We are all adults, 
and yet, some of the council 
members do not act like they are. 

I can remember last spring, 
when the elections not paying any 
attention to the speeches, glanc-
ing over the flyers, and avoiding 
the front page articles about the 
candidates. I realize now that I am 
to blame, as is anyone who did not 
pay attention to the elections or 
did not vote, for the state of the 
campus government this year. 

This year, let' s pay attention to 
what the candidates say, to how 
they act during their campaigns, 
and make next year a better one.

Cowley Way on Jan. 12. 

Schultz, clad only in her under-

50 times, according to a coroner's 
report. Schultz's boyfriend, Jon 
Bums, 28. was arrested in connec-
tion with that crime but was later 
released due to lack of evidence. 

A Mesa College student, wait-

for Tarr's body to be removed from 
the apartment Tuesday night, said 
the third murder made her more 

angry than did the previous ones. 
"When the first murder hap-

it was a nude dancer, and it was 
easy to write it off. [After) the 
second one] was more frightened. 
Now, I'm past frightened. I'm just

can cultures. 

Bond indicated that although 
the course material has not been 
detennined, Revelle's American 
Cultures course will probably 
include these ethnic groups, but 
"may not be limited to them." 

BecauseofUCSD's IO-week 
quaner system, Bond explained 
that Revelle's American Cul-
tures requirement would only 

focus on two ethnic groups instead 
of three. 

Though the American Cultures 
requirement is not yet a reality, 
Bond is confident about its pas-
sage through the Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP) and the 
Academic Senate in late May. 

"There's really not going to be 
any objection to it," he said. 

CEP Chair Steve Cox., a Revelle 
faculty member, did not comment 
on the American Cultures proposal, 

but said that he had vOled in 
favor of it at the March meeting. 

Lynn Harris, Academic Sen-
ate manager, explained that there 
is "no guarantee" that the meas-
ure would pass, but said it is 
likely that it will. 

"Most colleges, when they 
make a recommendation . .. it 
usually passes. Occasionally , it 
happens [that a faculty recom-
mendation is voted down), but it 
is very rare," she said.

GING BILLS 
For Some, Credit Use Can Get Out of Hand 
• Story By James Collier 
Features Editor 

A few years ago il was next to impossible 
for college students 10 get credit cards. 
Currently, it seems that I here isn ' t a student 
who can't obtain one. Previously, credit 
card companies catered to juniors and sen-
iors - now, companies like Visa, Master-
card, and American Express even try to 
recruit first-year students into being credit 
card users. 

According to the Consumer Credit Coun-
seling Service (CCCS), a non-profit organi-
zation that offers free credit counseling, 
more college students have credit cards today 
than ever before. The group reported that 
students are often using the cards beyond 
their means, and as a resu It are getting into 
serious debt. 

"It's real easy to go overboard," said Dan 
Marx. program associate for the consumer 
group Bankcard Holders of America. "Credit 
card companies are basically giving a card 
to people who have no experience." 

Marx said many students are letting their 
credit card use gel out of hand. and he 
commented that " it reflects in the incredible 
rise in bankruptcy. 

"Students buy this, buy that, and find 
themselves $3.000 in debt." he said. . 

Pan of the problem, Marx said, is that 
credit card companies lower their require-
ments for college students. 

" It can be a real problem," he said. "In 
many cases, in a special college-type deal, 
they will lower their requirements because it 
is a good way to get lifetime users." 

Paul Greer, president of the CCCS branch 
in San Diego, agrees with Marx about card 
"loyally." Greer added that college students 
are good risks for credit-card companies. 

" [They know thatJthe last resort is the 
student 's parents," Greer commented. 
"Creditors figure that this is going to save 
them loss-wise." 

Greer said that credit cards are basically 
"blank checks." The CCCS emphasizes that 
credit can be a tremendous asset - when 
handled prudently. 

Gregory Lew is a Revelle sophomore. 
He has four credil cards: Visa, Master Card, 
American Express, and a Sears card. He 
obtained three of the cards while he was a 
first-year student. 

"The first one I gOI was a Visa," Lew 
said. "I got a Sears card because they were 
giving away free glasses." 

Lew said he feels it is very simple to get 
a card. 

"It 's really easy," Lew said. "They trust 
you more because you're a college student." 

Does Lew feel he has too many credit 
cards? 

"Yeah, probably," he said, "but you just 
have to make sure to keep track of what 
you're spending." 

Greer said he lells college students: 
"Don'l get five credit cards - get one, If a 
student gets too many cards, it can be dan-
gerous." 

One occasional practice Lew has when 
he can't pay a credil bill is to get a cash 
advance from another credit card to pay for 
it. Once, when Lew had a monthly $400 

, It can be a real prob-
lem. In many cases, in a 
special college-type deal 
they wi II lower their 
requirements because it 
is a good way to get 
lifetime users.' 

-Dan Marx, program associate, 
Bonkcard Holders of America 

credil card bill that he couldn 't pay, he "paid 
half through a cash advance." 

Greer said that Lew's practice of using a 
cash advance from one credit card to pay a 
bill for another is common. He said studenls 
should just "try your best to pay [your bill] 
up monthly." 

He said that students' practice of paying 
credit card bills using cash advances is 
" throwing away money," and that "they're 
multiplying their trouble." 

Many credit counselors advise consum-
ers to spend no more than 20 percent of thei r 
monthly net income on credit. Lew said he 
spends "about 90 percent" of his monthly in-
come on credit. 

Lew, on the average, said he spends about 
$200 a month. 

"Most of the money I spend is on credit,"

Xenakis 
Thrns Math 
Into Music 
By CHRISTINA HUIZAR 
Senior SfaffWriler 

To crawl inside the head of 
lannis Xenakis and wander among 
the though Is would be a frightening 
experience. The sounds of scream-
ing voices and terrible cries would 
bounce around the inner walls only 
10 gain unstoppable momentum. 
Acute, sharp angles would project 
upward, punctuating his cerebel-
lum, into infinity. Then silence 
would suddenly fall upon the 
muffled shrieks like a wet blanket, 
suffocating those underneath. 
Chaos once again. 

Xenakis' thoughts and memories 
alone could drive a nonnal person 
insane. But Xenakis encapsulates 
these thoughts and emotions into 
tiny explosive packages thai unfold 
before your eyes and ears, in the 
fonus of composed music and 
architeclural design. 

UCSD has the unique experi-
ence of having Xenakis in resi-
dency at the Music Departmenl this 
week. The residency offers local 
audiences a rare opponunity to 
learn about a man whom many con-
sider one of the world's greatest 
living composers. 

lanais Xenakis was born in 
Romania of Greek parentage in 
1922. In 1932 his family moved 
back to Greece. When he reached 
college age, Xenakis entered the 
Athens Polytechnic, intending to 
betOme an engineer. 

.But the war that shook the 
world's frail nerves also shook his. 
Soon after World War II began, 
Greece was invaded. Xenakis rose 
from the shrieking voices and 
played an active role in the anned 
struggle for liberation. His was a 
mind yearning to be unleashed, to 
exist in open freedom. As a result, 
he soon became secretary to the 
resistance groups in the polytechnic 
institution. Bul on New Year's Day 
in 1945, Xenakis was bad!y 
wounded in the face, losing sight in 
one eye. Scars left behind from the 
blazing flames still mar one side of 
his face. 

Shortly thereafter, Xenakis was 
captured and condemned to death. 
His music expresses the human di-
mensions known only 10 one 
sentenced to die. Xenakis managed 
10 escape from his captors and 
finally settled in Paris in 1947, 
where he eventually took on French 
nationality, 

Since those early war years of 
unyielding despair, Xenakis has 
gone on to succeed in everything he 
has heartily auempted, admirers 
say. After the war he studied music 
and architecture in Paris and 
designed Ihe Philips Pavilion for 
the 1958 Brussels Exposition. 

Xenakis has a history of connect-
ing art and science in his works. As 

See XENAKIS, page 9

Continued from page 8 

he has explained, "For far too long. 
artists have suffered from the mis-
conceplion thai science was an in-
human pursuit proceeding meticu-
lously step by step, quite divorced 
from any such faculty as imagina-
lion. 

"Whereas in fact, the brilliant 
intuitive hypothesis is no less cen-
ttal to scientific advance than it is 
to artistic creation. Musicians have 
failed for 100 long to take tbeir 
rightful place in the inleLleclual 
vanguard of human thought." 

Through his work in musical 
composition, Xenakis has intro-
duced the tenn "stochastic music." 
Simply, such music is composed 
from extremely complex mathe-
matical calculations. 

Xenakis will perfonn a concert 
at UCSO on April 7. For a fuU 
calendar of events involving 
Xenakis, contact the Music De-
partrnent at 534-3230. 

Cohen Creates Miniature Rooms 
in Hair Dryer, Towel Dispenser 

An old Rayette hair dryer, a 
bathroom towel dispenser, a 
roasler. a waste can, and a plastic 
poodle purse have become, for 
artist Helen Cohen, the exteriors 
for detailed miniature interior 
roomscapes. 

1bese ilems, and more, will be 
on display until April 21 in an ex-
hibition at UCSO's Grove Gallery. 

'There will be a reception forthe 
artist from 6-8 p.m. on April 6 at 
the gallery. 

Cohen takes ordinary items, 
some which have a kilschy or fk:a 
marlc:et flavor, aodcrcalcsremarb-
bly realistic settings imide of them. 
'The viewer looks through conven-
iently placed peepholes to see 

perfectly normal-looking scenes. 
A 1950s pink and turquoise 

beauty parlor, a public bathroom 
with recently "used" paper lowels 
discarded on the floor, a kilchen 
with an ironing board set up near 
the sink - aU extremely Lillipu-
tian in size, and exact in detail -
are some of the interiors in the 
exhibition. 

"The insides of Cohen's pieces 
are not like doU houses, said Kevin 
Sloan, assistant director of the 
BraunsteinlQuay Gallery in San 
Francisco that handles Cohen's 
wort.. "These interiors look real, 
as if you were a giant peering into

he said, " if I can use credit - I will." 

Ken Scott, a spokesman for CCCS, said 
that for a person with Lew's spending habits 
"i t is very easy to get into trouble." Students 
usually don 't have full-time jobs, he said, 
and that limits how much of their monthly 
net income they can pend on credit. 

Greer saidfor tho e with credit sooner or 
later "there comes a day of reckoning - 30 
days later."

avoid credit problems:

want to be financially in two years, five 
years, and 10 years. Do your current spend-

Baseball 
Mishandles 
5-run Lead; 
Loses 7-5 
By MATTHEW RASBAND 
Staff Writer 

Five errors - which led to seven un-
earned runs - hun the UCSD baseball team 
as it let a 5-0 lead slip away and lost to Red-
lands on Tuesday, 7-5. 

The Tritons, ranked II th in the nation, 
now have a 14-9-2 record and drop to 9-3-1 
against Division ill competition. 

Losing on account of the defense, which 
to this point has the second-best fielding 
percentage of any UCS D team in the school's 
history, has not occurred often this year. 

I The UCSD women's eight will be among 80 rowing squads competing in the San Diego Crew Classic this weekend. 

"Our defense has been solid up to this 
point,"UCSD Head Coach Lyle Yates said. 
"We just had a defensive letdown which is 
bound to happen in a season." 

Early on, the Tritons appeared to be on 
their way to an easy victory, building a 5-0 
lead after six innings. It's Showtime for UCSD Crew Bulldog errors in the third and the fifth innings accounted for the first two UCSD 
runs. The S.D. Crew Classic Has Grown Into a World Cup Rowing Event In the sixth inning, UCSD pushed across 
three more runs, stringing together four hits 
and a walk. By SRINATH SANDA

watching, you may be surprised by the 
answer.

Odds are they will be watching the 
UCSD men 's and women 's crew teams 
compete, along with over4Oothercolleges 
and a host of international teams, in the 
17th annual San Diego Crew Classic this 

The Classic is one of only five races, and 
the only non-European race, in the first-ever 
World Cup in rowing. 

Like all crew regattas, this one is not di-
vided into Division 1. II, or ill. Instead,

Stottern Leads 
UCSD to 13th Place 
at UCI Invitational 
By ERIC BROSIO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team faced one of its toughest 
tests of the year on Monday when it headed to the UC 
Irvine Anteater Invitational at Big Canyon Country 
Club to compete against a mixture of Division I 
powerhouses and Division ill rivals. 

Although UCSD' s total of 650 (325-325) in the 
one-day, 36-hole event was 25 strokes better than last 
year's total, it was only good enough for 13th place, 
due primarily to the presence of 13 non-Division ill 
teams. 

The Tritons finished 40 strokes off the pace set by 
Division I San Diego State, which shot an impressive 
610 (307-303). 

UCSD might have finished even worse if not for 
the play of junior Matt Stottern, who filled in for Mike 
Reinhardt. The latter is normally a traveling squad 
regular, but he injured his foot and was unable to 
make the trip. 

The only distinctions in the Classic are 
that West Coast schools, including UCSD, 
compete for the Cal Cup. All East Coast 
schools, on the other hand, row for the 
men's Copley and women's Whittier Cups. 

Shortstop John Meyers singled to start 
off the innning and scored on a triple by third 
baseman Dave Ligerman. 

The colleges are separated from the in-
ternational teams, which will race against 
each other in the Elite Division. Interna-
tional teams scheduled to compete include 
squads from the United States, Canada, 
West Germany, and the Soviet Union. 

Designated hiner Karl Friedl, who went 
two for three with a walk, then pushed a bunt 
between the mound and first base against a 
drawn-in infield. 

Nobody covered first base, allowing 
Friedl to beat it out for an infield singl!!. 

All levels of competition at the Classic 
are operated similar to swim meets, with 

See CREW, page 15 

With runners on first and third, first t ase-
man Ted White singled in Ligerman as 
Friedl advanced to second.

LMU Teaches Us All How 
Dreams Must Continue 

UNL V captured the NCAA 
Basketball Championship Mon-
day. 

0 .1 the way, they opened and 
closed one of the most touching 
stories we've seen in a long time. 

They opened it with a win over 
Loyola Marymount, a team that 
had already captured the imagina-

BRIANITOW 
tion of the nation with its run-and-
gun, score and be scored upon style 
of play. They closed it three months 
later with another win. 

But, in between, these LMU 
Lions captured our hearts. 

They showed us how we can all 
come together in the face ofadver-
sity and work through it. 

[t almost seemed like one of 
those Afterschool Specials. 

leading a tiny parochial school to 
prominence and, perhaps, a berth 
in the NCAA Final Four. 

Until a month ago, it seemed 
they were well on their way. 

The Lions ran their way to 23-
5 record and ranked among the 
nation ' s Top 25. 

With Hank and Bo, they felt 
they had a legitimate shot at a 
National Championship. 

Yet, before they could make 
their run, Hank was gone, the vic-
tim of a weak heart. 

But his spirit neverleft. At least 
not on the basketball court, it didn ' \. 

On the court, he was every-
where: on placards, shoes,jerseys, 
and in the hearts and minds of 
everyone around. 

Stottern responded to his unexpected opportunity 
by shooting a team-low 159 (80-79). The 79 was 
impressive, but it could have easily been a 75 had 
Stottern not double-bogeyed the last two holes. 

Bob Knee had a 162 (78-84) at the UCI Tourney. Only it wasn't. 
Entering the season, the Lions 

were looking forward to a Cinder-
ella type of year. 

Seeded eleventh in their region, 
the overmatched Lions ran past 
sixth-seeded New Mexico State, 
and dismantled defendi ng National 
Champion Michigan. 

Normally, a 159 would not be considered a low 
score for the UCSD squad. 

Big Canyon, however, is regarded as one of the 
longest and mo t challenging course in Southern 

California. As a result, Triton golfers cumulatively 
managed only three sub-80 rounds. 

UCSD's number one player Devin Thoma fin-
ished right behind Stottern, improving on his first-
round ~core by six strokes for a total of 160 (83-77). 

See GOLF, page 15 

You know, two tars called 
Hank and Bo, and a coach who 
seemed to care more about 
Shakespeare than X's and O's 

And all the while, Hank was by 
their side. Watching over them. 

Off the coun. they had only 
each other as they fought to tay 
together and keep from fighting

preliminary heats Friday and the 
finals raced Saturday. 

The UCSD women's varsity 
eight team comes into the Classic 
with several big wins under its 
belt, including victories over USC, 
Cal Poly, and UC Santa Barbara. 

1bese wins are all the more 
notable in that the team is still in 
the early stages of rebuilding. 

"We are still a young team this 
year, with mostly second-year 
people. But, we' re physically bet-
ter than last year's record-setting 
team," Triton women's Head 
Coach Jack Vallerga said. 

Accord ing to Vallerga, the 
Tritons'main competition should 
come from USC, UCSB, Cal State 
Long Beach, and Mills College. 

UCSD would appear to have an 
edge, however, as it has already 
beaten both USC and UCSB in the

each other. 

But on it, they were playing his 
game. 

In the regional semifinals, they 
staved off a determined Alabama 
team, winning when one last Tide 
attempt bounced softly off the rim. 

It was almost as if Hank had 
been there to swat it away and 
preserve the Loyola dream: a berth 
in the regional final against the 
ever so talented Runnin' Rebels. 

There, not even Hank himself 
could have saved the Lions. 

There, the dream ended. 
At least the Rebels made it 

quick. 
"Today was the way the last 

three should have been," the Coach 
said afterward, "proof that the last 
three were unexplainable. 

"111ey were examples of hu-
man spirit rising above occasions. 
But we' re no angels and we can't 
always rise above." 

Maybe not, but they will al-
ways have an angel watching over 
them. 

Every time any of these Lions 
steps on the court, Hank will be 
there. 

But for now, the tournament is 
over_ For now. there is no more 
basketball, and no more Hank. 

This is no Afterschool Special 
where triumph emerges from trag-
edy and the story ends_ 

This story will go on.. 
And so will the Lions.

"Right now we are now in the 

middle of our season. We have 
been working hard, and I believe 
that our improvement has been 
constant," Vallerga said. 

100 men's varsity eightteam is 
having perhaps the most surpris-
ing year of any team in the Triton 
program. Though generally not 
considered a crew powerhouse,the 
Tritons are 5-0 on the year.

building for the last few years, 
posted victories over UC Davis, 
USC, Cal Poly, and UCSB. 

TIle UCD win last Saturday was 
the closest and most exciting so 
far, as the Tritons edged the Ag-
gies by just one second. 

"Previously we had been con-
sidered slow, but we've been re-
building for the past three years 
and have been worKing very hard," 
Varsity Captain Dave Barry said.

Another traveling-squad main-
stay,Bob Knee, reversed Thomas' 
feats as he shot an impressi ve first 
round 78, but fell off six strokes for 
a second round 84 enroute to a 36-
hole total of 162, the Tritons' third 
highest score on the day. 

Rounding out the traveling 
team, which frequently changes 
according to individual perform-
ance, was Bob Meyerson with a 
169 (84-85) and Campbell Wal-
drop, who had a 170 (85-85). 

Waldrop is only a first-year 
player, but according to Wydra, he 
is regarded as the brightest young 
prospect on the team based on his 
past perfonnances. 

Wydra was particularly pleased 
with the fiU-in performance or Stot-
tern. 

"Matt is usually competi ng 
closely with a rew other guys for 
the last spot on the traveling squad.

thing to prove." 
1be men's preliminary heat will 

feature the Tritons racing again t 
UCSB, Sacramento State, Santa 
Clara, UC Irvine, and CSU Long 
Beach. 

UCS D men 's Head Coach Mike 
Shannon believes that the Tritons' 
main oppos ition should come from 
UCSB and UCD, as both are ex-
peeted to bounce back after their 
losses to UCSD. 

Shannon pointed out, "all the 
crews in this field are good. TIle 
quality of crew on the West Coast 
has risen overthe past few years." 

The men's heat is scheduled for 
Friday at 5:45 p.m., and the finals 
for the men's Cal Cup will be held 
on Saturday at 10:30 a.m. 

The women's qualifying heat 
will take place Friday at6: 15 p.m. 
The women's Cal Cup fimJs will 
be held Saturday at I :55 p.m. 

NeitherTriton varsity squad has 
claimed the cup in the last 10 years. 

But he really came through this 
week," Wydra said. "He has got 
the ability to be consistently in the 
top five ." 

Perhaps the most discouraging 
aspeet of the toumament for UCSD 
was the fact that the Tritons fin-
ished 31 strokes behind Division 
ill rival Cal State San Bernardino, 
which finished fourth. 

"San Bernardino played very 
well for them. But when they came 
to Torrey Pines, we mashed them. 

"Now we have to go to Arrow-
head to play them at their home 
course. It is going to be an impor-
lant match," Wydra said regarding 
CSUSB's performance. 

The Tritons will first host UC 
Riverside and Pomona-Pitzer on 
Monday, April 9, at Torrey Pines 
South before traveling to Arrow-
head for their showdown with 
CSUSB on April 16. 

Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer 
will also compete in the laner four-
team matchup.

BASEBALL 
Continued from page 14 

A walk to catcher Anthony 
Sanchez, who was three for three 
including adouble, loaded the bases 
with no outs. 

To the dismay of Yates, the 
Tritons were only able to produce 
one more run in Ihe inning. 

The Tritons Ihreatened twice 
more, in the seventh and ninth 
innings, but were unable to push 
across another run. 

While the offense was produc-
ing runs, the pitchingofDann Eaton 
was silencing the Bulldogs ' bats. 

He breezed through the first four 
innings, allowing only one hit. 

Bad igns, however, started to 
appear in the fifth inning as Eaton 
began to tire. 

He allowed three singles, but 
got out of the inning with the help 
of a double play and a nice relay 
from rightfielder Ernie Isola to 
second baseman Erikk Aldridge to 
Sanchez at the plate. 

Redlands scored three runs, all 
unearned, on three hits and three 
crucial errors. 

With Eaton losing his control, 
Yates turned to Mike Morgan, who 
is nonnally a starter. 

The seventh inning started off 
on a bad note, as Sanchez was 
called for catcher's interference. 

After a strikeout, the next three 
Bulldogs reached base on an error 
and two Singles. 

Before the inning was over, 
Redlands had scored four more 
unearned runs to take a 7-5 lead. 

"Our pitching was fine and we 
had 12 hits on the day. We felt five 
runs was enough, but our defense 
didn ' t do the job," Yate said. 

UCSD is off until Salurday at 
12 p.m. when it plays a double-
header against Claremont College. 

The rivalry between these two 
teams is big, with UCSD holding a 
16-14 series lead over Ihe Stags. 

Greg Benes/Guardian 
First-year player Doran Yount was part of a Triton squad that blew a five-run lead at Redlands. 

The sixth inning was the be-
ginning of the end for Eaton and 
the Triton defense. 

"We have always had trouble 
with Claremont," Yates said. "We 
always seem to split (doublehead-
ers) with them. This time we need 
a sweep."

The Go-Go's Reunite: 

Story by Helena Leng Loh 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

If the Go-Go's had announced that they were doing a benefit gig back in 
the early punk days of the band, they would have been laughed right out of 
tinsel town. Not anymore. Benefit concerts like Live Aid and Amnesty 
International changed all that - now it is cool to be a rocker with a cause. 

The post-punk party band, which broke up in 1985, reunited last week 
for a sold-out environmental benefit concert at the Universal Amphithea-
ter in their hometown Los Angeles. 

The Go-Go's have come a long way from their teenaged Day-Glo punkl 
new wave beginnings. The band that once screamed out "We will overrun! 
The city! The country! The world!" now admonishes its fans to register to 
vote. 

"It was kind of hard to make political statements in the early eighties," 

Music News: 
Depeche Mode fans turn in-store 
promo into a riot. P3 

guitarist Jane Wiedlin explained in a recent phone interview, "becau e 
everyone just wanted to party." 

And party the Oo-Go's did. 
Many saw the group as a light pop band that churned out ummer car 

stereo hits like "Our Lips Are Sealed," "Head Over Heels," and of course, 
"Vacation. " 

Yet there was another side to the band - what Wiedlin called "the seedy 
underside of the Go-Go's." 

Wiedlin was drawn into the underground punk scene in the late '70s 
through her studies in fashion design. "It was teenage rebellion," Wiedlin 
said. "Every teenager needs some way to rebel and freak out the parents. 
Punk seemed to be the perfect way." See GO-GO'S, page 6

The last major independently-owned record 

label, Geffen Records, was sold to MeA Inc. for 
an estimated $545 million. The deal included 
MCA Inc. giving owner David Geffen one million 
newly issued shares of preferred stock that can be 
converted into 10 million shares of common 
stock. TIle deal also calls for Geffen to receive 
dividends equating to at least $6.8 million each 
year. This was a urprise move, for at the time 
Geffen was seriously considering a buyout offer by 
Thom-EMI for a reported $700 million in both 
cash and stock. The MCA Inc. pure stock deal 
may have been more advantageous to Geffen, as 
it was tax-free . The deal, which only took 48 
hours to complete, calls for Geffen Records (0 
operate autonomously within the MCA struc-
ture. The move is scheduled to happen after the 
Dec. 31 expiration of Geffen's current distribu-
tion deal with WEA . . . On the issue of parental 
warning stickers ... the major record labels re-
cently agreed to the National Association of 
Recording Merchandisers' demand for a uniform 
stickering pol icy . The agreement was reached at 
the March 10 meeting of the executives from 
NARM and the Recording Industry Associa, 
tion of America in Los Angeles. The major labels 
are expected to agree on the sticker's specifica-
tions sometime within the next couplc weeks. 
The proposed design will be about the size of a 
postage stamp. In contrast to the lengthy list of 
offensive topics proposed in the state bills, this 
sticker would be more to the point: "Parental 
warning - explicit lyrics." This move is the 
industry's at tempt to tell both consumers and the 
legislators that they don't need government inter-
venrion in the music business. But this evidence 
of good faith may not defuse the current state 
legislative push for labeling albums. It is possible, 
and quite probable, that one or more of the 
stickering bills currently proposed in 10 states 
could pass. If this occurs, as many as eight other 
states are thought to introduce simi liar bills within 
the next two years. If this happens, many retailers 
will nor carry the product of artists whom state 
officials claim to be "offensive." This would be a 
blow not only to the rap and heavy metal catego-
ries, but also to pop and alternative groups ... A 
Florida judge has ruled that record retailers in the 
local area could be arrested for selling the 2 Live 
Crew album As Nasty As They Wanna Be. This is 
the second time that this ruling has been sup-
ported in the area. As of March 9, law enforce-
ment officials notified retailers that, under the 
opinion of circuit court judge Mel! Grossman, the 

s 
album may be considered obscene under current 
srate law. Because of the ruling, retailers could 
face a misdemeanor charge for selling the album 
to an adult and a felony charge for selling it to a 
minor. The album, featuring the controversial 
cut "Me So Horny," contains graphic descrip-
tions of sexual activity. Skyywalker Records has 
released an alternate version of the record ex-
cluding this single. At press time, the original 
release sold 1.3 million copies, while the toned-
down version has only sold 200,000 
copies ... Danny Bonaduce, who played Danny 
in the "Parridge Family" and is now a late-night 
disc jockey on Philadephia's WEGX, was ar-
rested March 9 for crack possession in Daytona 
Beach, Florida. Bonaduce, who was filming an 
episode of the USA Network show"Youthquake," 
has been suspended from WEGX while he seeks 
treatment . . .singer Boy George has become the 
president of the U.K. independent dance music 
label More Protein Records . His interest was 
piqued in early 1989 when Jeremy Healy, for· 
merly of Haysi Fanrayzee, wrote several songs 
George thought to be potential hits. When his 
label, Virgin Records, failed to provide support, 
George used his own money to produce the songs. 
The resulting track, "Everything Begins with an 
E" by Ezee Posse, has sold over 32,000 copies in 
the U.K. and the U .S. Virgin Records recently 
agreed to distribute More Protein product in 
Europe. Another act on the label is Jesus Loves 
You, George's own project which united the 
vocalist with former Culture Club drummer Jon 
Moss for the house track "After the Love" ... After 
a decade of working in the music business, Peter 
Murphy finally broke into the top 40 with the 
single "Cuts You Up." The single has been No. 1 
for seven straight weeks on the Modem Rock 
T racks charts .. . Upcoming album releases: Behind 
the Mask, the first studio album from Fleetwood 
Mac since Tango in the Night, is scheduled to be 
out April 10; Madonna 's Sire successor to Like a 
Prayer, I'm Breathless, is tenatively set for May 15; 
Welcome [0 the Terrordome, Public Enemy's next 
Def Jam release, will be out mid-April; Shut Up 
and Dance, a collection of Paula Abdul's remixed 
singles, will arrive sometime this 
spring .. . Midnight Oil is currently on the road. 
The tour, in support of their latest Columbia 
release, Blue Sky Mining, will stop in Southern 
California for four consecutive nights: 6/19-6/20 
in Los Angeles, 6/21 in San Diego, and 6/22 in

Fans Just Can't Get Enough 

Oepeche Mode In-Store 
Signing Cause Riot 

By Patricia Jettie 
Hiatus Editor 

In Los Angeles recently, a large 
group of fans displayed the typical 
reac tion of mass hysteria often seen 
in the presence of rock stars: 
screaming girls fainting on the 
sidewalk and boys, emulating their 
idols' physical apparel, throwing 
themselves onto a limousine. 

But this was not in reaction to 
Paul McCartney's recent Southern 
California visit. Rather, the 
estimated 15,000 frantic fans that 
filled the 15 blocks surrounding 
Where house Records on Third and 
La Cienega on March 20 were 
clamoring to catch a glimpse of 
the techno-pop groL!p Depeche 
Mode. 

Coming from as far as Arizona, 
some fans had been waiting in line 
for over 48 hours. "The reason why 
I love Depeche Mode is [because] 
they're all gorgeous," one older 
woman giggled. "My husband is 
right here. and he's going to kill 
me." 

The event, sponsored by 
Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. 
and KROQ-FM, was designed to 
help promote the band's latest Sire 
Records release, Violator: The 

British quartet arrived at the 
autograph signing intending to 
remain for three hours . But 
everyone, including the band, was 
surprised at the turn-out. "We 
thought there was going to be about 
30 people," synthesist Andrew 
Fletcher said during the signing. 

As soon as the group entered 
the building, the fans began 
pushing forward, climbing trees 
and cars in an attempt to peer 
through the record store's windows. 
Fletcher and fellow band members 
Martin Gore, Alan Wilder, and 
David Gahan were whisked away 
after only an hour as the previously 
calm crowd teetered on the edge of 
rioting. 

One teenage girl was trampled 
and seven other youths injured as 
the crowd excitedly pushed up 
against the front of the store. As 
the band left, the human grid-lock 
that filled the street became 
uncontrollable. Los Angeles police 
said although no one was seriously 
hurt, there were several reports of 
broken windows caused by thrown 
bottles. 

"Things got out of hand," a Los 

Ange les Po lice Department 
sergeant, who wished to remain 
anonymous , said . " It 's their 
company's fau It . They should have 
known that this was going to 
happen, with those people being 
[outside the store] that long. They 
should have told us before." 

The day after the incident, the 
band flew to Mexico to attend a 
previously-scheduled press 
conference. Fletcher called 
KROQ-FM and apologized on the 
air to the band's fans for leaving 
the store early. "We've done many 
in-store's in our career," he said. 
"That amount of people have never 
turned up." 

The LAPD, in addition to 
several city officials, called for the 
band, the record store, KROQ-
FM, and Warner Bros. Records to 
pay the $25,000 the band 's 
appearance cost the city in police 
time, paramedics, and clean-up. 
Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc. 
has agreed to pay the damages. 

Yet Los Angeles City City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky felt 
that the responsibility for the mini-
riot should be distributed between 
the four parties. The day after the 
event, KCAL-TV news (Channel 
9) televised a live debate between 
Yaroslavsky and KROQ.FM disc 
jockey Richard Blade, promoter of 
the event for the radio station. 

"Wherehouse Records, and to 
the extent that KROQ radio was 
involved, is responsible for one of 
the most incredibly poor 
judgement calls that I have ever 
seen," Yaroslavsky said. "This was 
not a demonstration to free Nelson 
Mandela. This was a commercial 

Oepeche Mode, techno-pop stars with a depressing messFlge. 
promotio n on the part of 
Wherehouse Records. 

"When I arrived there at 11 
p.m .. . . there were six paramedic 
ambulances stat io ned there . I 
wonder how many heart attacks 
went unanswered because we had 
six ambulances par~ed at Third 
and La Cienega." 

Blade responded that the radio 
station was not responsible for 
aggravating the situation. "We are 
the vehicle which lets people know 
what's happening ... Our job is to 
play music, not to arbitrate only a 
certain amount of people who can 
go [and attend such events]." 

Blade further claimed that the 
rioting was not expected. 
"Altho ugh it wasn' t a 
demonstration, it really wasn't a 
commercial enrerprise, either," he 
explained. "The people who wai ted 

in line for two days were going to 
buy the record whether or nor 
Depeche Mode were there ... To 
say it wasjustacommercial venture 
on behalf of the Wherehouse is 
wrong. It was just the venue [the 
band] was at." 

I t is natural for people to want 
to point the finger of blame, but in 
the case of this specific incident, 
no one is completely responsible. 
Depeche Mode's personal 
promotions are handled by a 
private company; likemanyarrists, 
they felt that theirrecord label was 
too bogged down wi th other artists 
to direct enough attention to their 
work. The problem was that these 
pri vate promoters fa i led to see that 
fans, who had been waiting over 
4 8 hours, could become 
uncontrollably excited when

The Goings-On of KSDT 
By Walter Bius 

Staff Writer 
I've often heard people a k 

inquisitively, "What is KSDP" 
Others think they know what 
KSDT is: a weird group of kids 
interested only in clothes and hair-
cuts who play an ensemble of bois-
terous, drug-induced music out of 
a Tim Leary nightmare. 

but anarchy is just freedom . 
"This sense of freedom does not 

mean coming into the station and 
tearing it apart, rather being able 
to express your views the way you 
want to. What is life without it?" 

Frank l um/Guardiall 

Inside KSDT there exists a 
medium for student expression, as 
well a ' the responsibility of oper-
ating a student-run college radio 
station. The place has an eclecti-
cal make-up where students are in 
contro!' 

KSDT was founded in the 1960s 
as a student-run organization and 
that format has continued to the 
present. One important goal of 
KSDT is to acquire an FCC li-
cense that will allow broadcasting 
on FM radio. Deejay Kevin Glickman communicates nonverbally with a crowd on the hump outside KSDT. 

El Ghazalli, resident OJ and 
philospher explam KSDT as, 
"Pure freedom, and about as close 
as you can get to pure anarchy." 
Anarchy is an important concept 
- a lot of people are afraid of it, 

The UniverSity has been trying 
to acquire an FCC license for three 
years, and has moved closer to that 
goal by soliciting the help of talk-
show radio KSDO. 

"Due to a previous agreement, 
the Communications Department 
would have Jurisdiction over the 

license, but that does not mean 
KSDT will not be a part of it," 
KSDT's General Manager Steve 
Branin said. "There is a committee 
who is overseeing this procedure, 
and I am trying to keep in close 
contact with them. There are 
members on the committee who 

IBM 
announces 

believe a student-run station is a 
good thing." 

Ghazalli expressed his dissatis-
faction with the amount of time it 
has taken to get the license. "We 
should be getting first priority as a 
public institution as opposed to 
those born-again radio networks,"

Ghazalli said. "If we get a license it 
might be taken out of student 
control. College radio should al-
ways be in the control of the stu-
dents because students pay for this 
schoo!." Right now KSDT is re-
stricted to a one-hour hump show 
and is available in some of the 
dorms. The move right now is to 
try and get the station heard in all 
of the dorms as well as being 
hooked up to the Price Center 
sound system. Students then, in-
stead of listening to a random sta-
tion, would be able to hear their 
own student-run station. 

About 90 percent of the KSDT 
format is music-based and includes 
a diversity of styles - rap, metal, 
blues, jazz, and punk all have a 
home at KSDT. The station is also 
broadcasting UCSD news and 
sports, as well as providing a forum 
for the A.S. president to keep 
students updated in the abyssal 
happenings of student govern-
ment. 

KSDT is a station that is made 
up of all volunteers. Program Di-
rector Vicky Kim said, "I spend 30 
hours a week organizing and lis-
tening to music that will be played 
on the station. We receive records 
from all over the country, from 
both independent as well as major 
record labels. In commercial radio 
they control their playlists, but 
KSDT's play lists are shaped by 
what the DJ's are playing." 

College music stations are the 
front line of new music, and what 
is being olayed on them today will 
be played on commercial radio 
tomorrow. Kim went on to say, 
"Commercial radio is designed for 
whatever sells; it's all money in-
volved.It's a good thing to have a 
place like college radio that is not 
being driven by money." 

Bands such as REM, T he Pixies, 
Sugarcubes, and even U2 can 
attribute their success to being 
exposed first to the public on 
college radio. 

KSDT has started working with 
other student groups to provide 
entertainment and diversity for the 
campus community. According to 
DJ Ted Tarris, "More student 
support is needed. We try to work 
with otherorganizations, but some 
such as Assorted Vinyl have not 
been very cooperative. To get 
student suppOrt, we need to be 
able to reach them." 

Students and KSDT are 
synonymous. The station is run by 
students ~ r students. So the next 
time you walk by KSDT, top in 
and take a look and listen. 

'Lord of the Flies' is a 
Hidden Treasure 

By Scott Casmer 
Staff Writer 

I t seems that every so often 
there is a desire in Hollywood to 
tum a great book into a great movie. 
It's difficult to say why, but the 
spark that appears in the book 
rarely manifests itself in the cin-
ema production. The new Harry 
Hook film "Lord of the Flies," is 
one of the few truly successful at-
tempts at making such a transla-
tion. 

True to Sir William Golding's 
novel, the movie starts out with 
the plane crash and stranding of 
twenty-four young men on a small 
island. 

These military academy stu-
dents, all played by unknown ac-
tors between the ages of eight and 
13, proceed to set up a society that 
will hopefully keep them alive long 
enough to be rescued. 

Like the book, the beginning is 
dull, but it gives the viewer a good 
idea of the background which will 
explain many of their future ac-
tions. After taking into account 
their expected naivete, these young 
men do an exceptional job of set-
ting up living arrangements. 

Soon a power struggle breaks 
out between the original leader, 
Ralph (Balthazar Getty, the great-
grandson of oil magnate J. Paul 
Getty), and Jack (Chris Furrh) . 

While both actors portray their 
characters with skill beyond their 
years, Furrh seems to be a natural 
for the rebellious powermonger, 
Jack. His performance allows the 
audience to follow the Jack's sav-
age emotions. 

One other character worthy of 
strong praise is actor Danuel 
Pipoly, who plays Piggy. In real 
life, the Orange County youth is 
involved in the Boy.Scouts, which 
helps validate his role. He por-

Go~Go's 
Continued from page 1 

She gave up her academic ca-
reer for a musical career, forming 
the Go-Go's with lead singer Be-
linda Carlisle, bassist MargotOlav-
erra, and drummer Elissa Bello -
none of whom knew how to play 
their in truments. 

They didn't kn w how to plug 
in their amps, either - so they 
asked Charlotte Caffey, former bas-
sist of the Eye (whose drummer 
D.J. Bonebrake went on tojoinX), 
to help out. Caffey eventually 
joined the band as guitarist -
even though she'd never actually 
played lead guitar before. 

Their first gig, opening for the 
Dickies, consisted oftwo ong -
or, actually, one and a half. Half-
way through "Robert Hilburn" (an 
attack on the L.A. Times music 
critic), Wiedlin forgot her chords, 
so they repeated "Overrun" as an 
encore. 

There was nowhere else to go 
bur up. The band, with veteran 
drummer Gina Schock and guitar-
ist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine 
replacing Bello and Olaverra, was 
signed by I.R.S. Records in 1981. 
Their debut album Beaut)' and the 
Beat stayed at number one on the 
Billboard charts for six consecu-
tive weeks. 

In its 10th anniversary edition, 
the college / alternative rock-ori-
ented CMJ magazine rated Beaut)' 
and the Beat the top album of the 
1979-89 decade, beating out such 
powerful acts as the Police, R. E.M. , 

Talking Heads, and the Clash. The 
magazi ne noted, "Think of it what 
you may [now]. but without it, you 
may not be Ii tening to much of 
what you do today." 

"Female mu icians are no big 
deal now, " an Diego Reader Mu-
sic Editor John D'Agostino re-
cently commented. "Ten years ago 
they were. The Go-Go's made the 
music industry see that all-women 
bands can make money." 

A for today' woman rockers, 
Wiedlin remarked, "I think we did 
influence some female 
musicians, although no 
one really wants ro 
come right ou( and 
admit it!" 

So what's it like to 
be a woman in an all-
female band? The Go-
Go's often joke that 
because they've never 
been men, they really 
wouldn't know. 

Wiedlin pointed 
out, though, that the 
band did share a special 
female camaraderie: 
they claimed that their 
"girl talk" would shock 

the band-certainly not with my 
husband, and not really with my 
other girl friends either," Wiedlin 
continued. 

"With the Go-Go's, there's so 
much history: we pent so many 
years on the road together, being 
with each other twenty-four hours 
aday, haringhotelrooms ... lthink 
maybe it's like guys who've been 
through a war together - that 
kind of bonding." 

Tho e clo e bonds carried the 
band through a tough period be-

anyone - especially The Go-Go's Turn To You in 1984. 
guys. 

"You know, male bands are 
supposed to get real raunchy, but I 
think we're worse," Wiedlin de-
clared. "When we're together, 
we're always trying to outdo each 
other with our remarks. It's funny 
how I just fell back into that mode 
of behavior with the girls when we 
all saw each other again last year, 
since I hadn't had a chance to talk 
like that with anyone since' left 

tween 1982's Vacation album and 
1984's Talk Show, during which 
guitarist Caffey suffered numbness 
in her left arm, and drummer 
Schock underwent surgery for a 
congenital heart defect. 

There were other health prob-
leins too. "It was kind of inevitable 
that the band got involved in 
drugs," Wiedlin said, "since it was 
all around us in the Ufestyle we 

lived .. .l felt pretty shitty about 
that. I wish it hadn't happened, 
but I think everyone's come out 
tranger because of it." 

Yet the strain did get to the 
band. Wiedlin left the Go-Go's in 
late 1984 to pursue her own career 
as a solo singer/songwriter; the 
band officially broke up half a year 
later. 

Carlisle, assisted by Caffey, went 
on to a solo career with three Top 
40 albums. Wiedlin has also just 
completed her third 010 album, 

Tangled, with the title 
song featured in the 
movie "Pretty 
Woman." And while 
Schock (House of 
Schock) and Caffey 
(the Graces) have each 
released one post-Go-
Go's album with new 
bands, Valentine has 
yet to sign on with a 
record company. 

"We've all worked 
really hard to make it 
on our own, apart from 
the Go-Go's," Wiedlin 
commented. 

N ot only did the for-
mer Go-Go's pursue 
their musical projects 

individually; they also pursued 
their political projects unaware of 
their mU[tial interest in environ-
mental issues. When Carlisle's 
manager Danny Goldberg sug-
gested a benefit for the California 
Enviornmental Protection Initia-
tive planned for the November 
1990state ballot, the band jumped 
at the opportunity. 

Wiedlin explained that they 

thought a benefit show would be 
perfect for a reunion. "We tltdn't 
want pe pie to think that we were 
reunitingjust forthe money, which 
is what a lot of bands do." 

How about the MEGO - My 
EyesGlazeOver - Effect, in which 
the public is deluged with exces-
sive environmental hype? 
"There've been a lot of endorse-
ments by celebrities in the past few 
years, which is good to an extent," 
Wiedlinsaid. "But it's also danger-
ous because it might lead people to 
think that they can just sit back 
and let the celebrities save the 
world we live in. There's so much 
that you can do jll t by yourself-
recycle, don 'teat at fast food joints, 
don't eat meat, don't wear fur." 
She paused, then giggled . "That's 
my lecture ." 

Onstage, the Go-Go's contin-
ued to "lecture" their audience, 
combining seriousness with fun as 
they repeatedly reminded the 
crowd to sign the Initiative peti-
tion. "Without a clean environ-
ment, there'd be no surfing!" they 
added as they splashed into an 
extended jam of their catchy in-
strumental "Surfing & Spying," 
which was featured on the "Fast 
Times at Ridgemont High" sound-
track. 

The hour-and-a-half set proved 
that the Go-Go's can rock-with 
both spit and polish. 

Their encore rendition of the 
Shangri- las'''Walkingin the Sand" 
was one of very few songs that the 
crowd couldn't - and didn't -
sing along to. The cover, which 
the Go-Go's used to play in their

nita Tikaram 
The Sweet Keeper 
Reprise Records 

The husky voiced singer/song-
writer born in Germany is back 
with her second album which was 
written during her last world 
concert tour. While Tanita Ti-
karam has reached European suc-
cess with her debut, Ancient Hear!, 
she has yet to conquer the Ameri-
can market. 

Tikaram's latest release, The 
Sweet Keeper, lacks the soft b:end 
of mellow music she used on her 
first album. Instead of capturing 
the listener with catchy lyrics and 
dramatic melodies, her new album 
is full of flat, unmemorable songs. 

Tikaram tries to cover up her 
sultry voice by usingastringquartet 
and a mesmerizing piano score. In 
addition, the music drowns out 
her voice, making most of the lyr-
ics incomprehensible. 

It is unfortunate that Tikaram 
failed to grow musically from her 
debut. She has a limited vocal 

range, whileherfortc issoft,croon-
ing soft love songs. If Reprise both-
ers to renew her comract, perhaps 
Tikaram will have developed a 
sense of style strong enough to 
eparate her from thecompetition.

Jive Bunny & the Mastermixer' 
The Album 
ATCO/Music Factory 

A London-based group 
comprised of eight talented men, 
The Mastermixers, recently com-
!Jiled a forty-two minute mix of 
traditional fifties rock-and-roll, 
with some other classical styles of 
music. The variety of sty Ie they 
have stuffed onto the album is 
phenomenal. The group has cuts 
from all kinds of classic artists such 
as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry,little 
Richard, Chubby Checker, and 
Paul Anka. 

Even though most of the music 
. is 50's style, they have managed to 

break the music down into eight 
distinct "songs," each having its 
own theme or mood. 

They have traditional rock 
mixes, a love song, and a strange 
combination including Hawaii 
Five-O tunes. In addition, they 
delve into a Glenn Miller medley. 
Overall, there are cuts from nearly 
seventy songs and almost as many 
artists. There's definitel y no repe-
tition here. 

One of the most amazing as-
pects of this album is the sound 
quality. With the exception of a 
couple cuts, there is absolutely no 
surface noise, tape hiss,or any other 
annoying sounds from old 
recordings. This may not be a 
concern to most people, but to the 
true audiophile, it is a pleasant 
surprise. 

Ministry 

By Scott Casmer 
Staff Writer 

The Mind is a Terrible Thing 
to Taste 
Sire Records 

It can be called nothing short 
of a musical assault. The Mina is a 
Terrible Thing to Taste, the latest 
from the Chicago-based Ministry 

is a blend of chaos and anarchy, 
the kind of stuff that makes the 
Chili Peppcrssound like Barry Ma-
nilow. 

The lyrics are unintelligible 
except for an occasion;,l "kill!" or 
"death" escaping from the heavy 
percussion and guitar. There is the 
occasional sampling of such quips 
of wisdom as "I kill to show that 
I'm alive." 

Yet, one does not listen to this 
band for the lyrics. The appeal is in 
the intensity of the beat and the 
feeling of extremities. 

This music, filled with images 
of war and death, makes you want 
to trash your room and light some-
thing on fire . The skull on the 
cover is not just an ad agency's 
campaign. 

If this is the attitude you enjoy 
gleaning from your music, Minis-
try is the choice for you. Soaring 
far above the rest of the industrial 
and garage band scene, there actu-
ally is a stylistic difference from 
one song to the next. Truly tran-
scending the medium, Ministry 
even manages to throw in a glimpse 
of the fact that they possess some 
musical talent. 

Labeled progressive by those 
who swear by it and awful noise by 
those who do not, this music may 
be on its way to future top 40, 
judging by the current escalation 
of angst and violence in the art 
world. 

If this is the case, then Ministry 
surely will be leading the pack, a 
Mozart of the medium.

Serban to Direct 'Our Country's Good' 
If you are looking for something to do this 

weekend, you may want to check out" ur 
Country's Good." The UCSD Theatre Depart-
ment is currently performing Timberlake 
Wertenbaker's contemporary play is about the 
first pri on ship arriving at Au tralia's Botany Bay 
Colony in 1789. 

"[It is] about physical and psychological tor-
ture. We are invaded with new plays which are 
mirroring our life from a grim point of view. It is 
refreshing to see a play that is intelligent and 
hopeful and presents the message of the story in an 
uplifting way." 

P.M. in the room ~ from the Guardian offices (directly 
I above the food co-op), 2nd floor of the Student center. I L ___________________ ~ 

Th performance, which opened lastnightand 
will run through next Sunday, is directed by 
Andrei Serban, a world-renowned director. 

"Our Country's Good" is a voyage into th 
complex and often painful relationship between 
the prisoner and their captors. Adapted from the 
Thomas Keneally novel The Playmakers, the play 
open with English prisoners arriving in Botany 
Bay after a physically and mentally difficult voyage. 

The convicts, aided by the soldiers who are 
their captors, are forced to perform a production of 
the Farquar play, "The Recruiting Officer." While 
preparing for the performance, they search within 
them elves and eventually retrieve a portion of 
their 10 t dignity. 

''What attracted me to this play is that it is a 
play about freedom and lack of freedom, slavery, 
and social injustice," Serban said. 

A native Romanian, Serban received his tech-
nical training in theater at the University of 
Bucharest. His most recent works include a pro-
duction of "Twelfth Night" at the American 
Repertory Theatre and the opera "Prince Igor" at 
the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. 

Last spring, Serhan lecured at UCSD, instruct-
ing students on a variety of acting methods. Well 
known for his training methods, he enjoyed the 
experience of working with tudent actors. 

"Students approach a material freshly," he 
explained. "Enthusiasm, curiosity, and their state 
of active questioning is much more important 
than the deadly professional attitude of an actor 
stubbornly repeating yesterday's success."

Theatre, pm through Saturday, 7 pm on unday. $6 for tudenrs, $8

meeting their idols. 

The British pop stars are 
immensely popular both in Europe 
and Asia. On the whole, the U.S. 
reaction, although positive in such 
cities as New York, Houston, and 
Chicago, has been fairly lukewarm. 
But for some reason. the band has 
been embraced by the Los Angeles 
music scene. 

The band attributes radio 
backing. especially the constant 
uppert of the alternative rock 

format of KROQ-FM, as a major 
factor in coalescing the group's 
Southern California popularity. 
"It's radio," Gore told the Los 
Angeles Times in a recent interview.

OPENS FRIDAY, APRIL 6TH AT A THEATRE NEAR YOU. 
8 HIATUS APRIL 5, 1990 

"We get much stronger radio 
support here [in Los Angeles] than 
anywhere else." 

The reason that this event has 
caused such a stir, besides the 
obvious fact that riots tend to 
attract the media's attention, is 
because Depeche Mode is not a 
superpower in the music business. 
Out of the 10 albums and 23 singles 
the group has relea ed in the past 
nine years, only "Personal Jesus," 
the initial single off of Violator, has 
gone gold in the U.S. 

Regardless of reason, Depeche 
Mode is obvi usly creating a stir. 
The publicity from the 
Wherehou e incident, albeit 
unintentional, can only help alert 
the rest of the country to the band's 
growing st&tus. 

Go--Go's 
continued from page 6 
Go-Go's used to play in their early 
shows, paid homage to both their 
female predecessors and their punk 
beginnings with its wailing "oh no 
no no's" and howling guitar riffs. 

The Go-Go's showed that, 
unlike the girl groups of the sixties, 
they are not just pretty faces but 
talented musicians with still 
untapped potential. It was apparent 
from the band's energizing raw 
power that the five-year hiatus had 
improved their musicianship. 

Rather than j ust sticking to the 
basic three-minute song format. 
the Go-Go's varied th~ 
arrangements of some songs, 
throwing in surprises here and 
there for the audience. "You can 
keep the beat on this one," Wiedlin 
demurely advised the crowd -
leading everyone to think that they 
were about to break into their 
Billboard No. 2 hit "We Got the 
Beat." 

But instead the band started 
playing an acoustic version of their 
normally upbeat "Vacation." 

Schock eventually ran back to 
her drum set, leaving the rest of 
the band at the front of the stage to 
deal with the beach balls that the 
crowd kept tossing about. When 
Carlisle kicked a ball out to the 
audience, her 'hoe flew off and 
landed at Rob Lowe's feet. 

Backstag after the concert, 
Lowe (who wa featured in the 
Go-Go's 1984 video "Tum To 
You") remarked thatwhi le the Go-
Go's were till a band that wa all 
about having fun, they were also 
helping to create an awareness of 
urgent is ues such as the 
environment. 

Given the succe s of the 
concert , the band announced 
afterwards that they plan to tour 
together in the fall. Carlis le 
explained, "We took a vote to see 
if we had enough fun to do 
something together gain, and we 
decid d yeah. We will." 

Lo k like we an expect to be 
beat head over heel with more 
cau es aft r our vacati n.
