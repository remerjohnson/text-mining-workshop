Editor In Chief 

An expert witness testified on 
autopsy findings in the continuing 
murder trial of former UCSD 
medical student Charlie 
Richardson. The defendent 
pleaded not guilty to murdering 
his wife. 

Yesterday 's proceedings were 
marked by the testimony of expert 
witness former Chief Medical Ex-
aminer for the San Diego County 
Coroner's office Ronald L. Rivers. 

The prosecution asked Rivers 
to link physical injuries found on 
the body of Maria Richardson in a 
December 1988 autopsy to those 
found on the defendant on the day 
of his wife's death. 

Rivers explained that Maria 
Richardson "was asphyxiated due 
to ligature strangulation" in what 
his autopsy report officially cate-
gorized as a homicide. 

Maria Richardson 's body, 
which was found at her work place 
in the 200 block of West Washing-
ton Street in El Cajon on Dec. 20, 

Police Find No Evidence To 
Connect Clairemont Murders 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staf!Writer 

The investigation continues into 
the fatal stabbing of Warren Col-
lege senior Janene Weinhold, but 
San Diego Police homicide detec-
tives have not found a definite link 
between Weinhold's murder and 
last month's stabbing of a San Di-
ego State University student in the 
same Clairemont neighborhood. 

bors, hoping that somebody saw 
something," Petrick said. 

On Jan. 12, Tiffany Schultz, a 
20-year-old SDSU student, was 
found stabbed to death at her apart-
ment on Cowley Way in Claire-
mont, a few blocks from the site of 
Weinhold's death. 

Schultz, who worked as a nude 
dancer at the Les Girls nightclub in 
Point Lorna, was an English major 
who planned to become a profes-

on guard, even in familiar areas, to 
prevent similar crimes. 

"I think I'd just be aware of 
your surroundings. Anyone who is 
going to attack you is going to give 
you some waming," Petrick said. 

Noting that there was no sign 
that Weinhold's assailant forced 
his way into her apartment, Petrick 
said: "You just can't walk around 
in oblivion. Know who you let into 
your house." 

1988, exhibited what Rivers said 
were the signs of a violent death. 

The now retired medical exam-
iner read detailed descriptions and 
pecific dimensions of the "linear 

abrasions" he found on Maria 
Richardson 's neck and chin and 
commented that "the abrasions 
over the chin would indicate that 
there was a struggle." 

Questions from attorneys on 
both sides of the case centered on 
whether or not the injuries found 

on Maria Richardson's neck and 
those discovered by police on the 
defendant's pinky fingers could 
have been produced by a long tele-
phone cord of the type found near 
her body. 

Under cross examination by 
defense attorney Rick Siref, Riv-
ers acknowledged that the neck 
wounds could have been caused 
by a clothesline, or any other wire-
like object of dimensions corre-

National Groups Review 
'Fighting Words' Policy 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

Although the UC Fighting 
Words Policy is receiving upport 
from several national minority 
groups, the American Civil Liber-
tie Union has declared the policy 
"unconstitutional. " 

The Fighting Words Policy, 
implemented by the UC in Sep-
tember 1989, threaten student 
with possible uspension for the 
u e of words that are "widely rec-
ognized to be derogatory references 
to race, ethnicity, religion, sex, 
sexual orientation, disability, and 
other personal characteristics." 

Several state and national or-
ganizations are supporting the 
UC's position on "fighting words," 
including the Jewish Anti-Defa-
mation League, the National As-
sociation for the Advancement of 
Colored People (NAACP), and the 
National Organization of Women 
(N.O.W.). 

Linda Joplin, state coordinator 
for N.O.W., believes the Fighting 
Words Policy would "create a 

positive influence" on the UC 
campuses. 

"There are instances on college 
campuses when certain words are 
u ed against women and certain 
words are critical of lesbians and 
gays. N.O.W. opposes discrimina-
tion on a basis of sexual orienta-
tion, race, creed, and gender. I ee 
[the Fighting Words Policy] as a 
way of implementing a positive 
learning atmo phere," Joplin said. 

According to Joplin, the lack of 
a policy prohibiting the use of 
derogatory epithets makes it "seem 
as though it is socially acceptable 
for people to u e word such as 
these." 

Esther Nelson, public relations 
director for the NAACP, said the 
NAACP is supportive of the UC's 
implementation of the Fighting 
Words Policy, as part of its oppo-
sition to racial slurs. 

"I think that tolerating the use 
of racial slurs sends out the mes-
sage that it's all right to be ugly and 
unkind to people who are differ-
ent," Nelson said.

Last Friday at 8:30 p.m., 

Weinhold's body was found by 
her roommate in their apartment 
on Clairemont Drive. Weinhold 
had been stabbed at least twice in 
the chest. 

Schultz's boyfriend and room-
mate, Christopher Bums, was ar-
rested in connection with the crime, 
but later released due to lack of 
evidence. 

UC Fights To Keep Files Secret 
Weinhold, 21, a history and 

political science double major, had 
planned to go to law school in 
California or Arizona after gradu-
ating in June. She was from 
Scottsdale, Arizona. 

Police initially reported that 
drawers had been ransacked at the 
residence, but later said Weinhoid 
herself had apparently been going 
through her financial aid and tax 
papers. 

"We're speculating atthis point, 
but I would say robbery was not 
the motive," Detective Sgt. Ed 
Petrick aid. 

According to Petrick, Weinhold 
had apparent! y been killed between 
11 :30 a.m. and 2 p.m. Friday, and 
there was no sign of forced entry at 
the residence. 

"We're still talking to neigh-

However, Bums remains the 
only suspect in the crime, accord-
ing to Detective Sgt. Ray Sigwalt. 

"So far we have found nothing 
to link the cases, other than that 
they were both female college 
students," Petrick said. 

Petrick noted that the two vic-
tims did not know each other and 
were very different people. 

"One is a straight-A student, 
and the other is a nude dancer .... 
The UCSD student kept very much 
to her elf and studied hard, and the 
other girl was obviously a little 
different," Petrick said. 

Despite the lack of evidence 
linking both murders, homicide 
detectives are continuing to inves-
tigate the two ca es in conjunction 
with each other. 

Petrick warned students to be

StajfWrJw 

A recent Supreme Court rul-
ing on the standard university 
practice of keeping faculty files 
secret may influence a len-year 
legal battle to open UC faculty 
biring and tenure files. 

On Jao. 9, the Supreme Coun 
ruled. in the case of University of 
Pennsylvania v. the EqllQl Em-
ployment Opportunity Commis-
sion, that the University could 
not hide behind confidentiality 
and must disclose faculty files. 

This case, in whicb a female 
faculty member made allegations 
of sex discrimination after being 
denied tenure, has a direct effect 
on the appeal case in California. 
University procedures currently 
do not allow her to see informa-

HIATUS 

tion in her files based on peer re-
views that disqualified her. 

Gary Adest. executive director 
of the University Council-Ameri-
can Federation of Teachers (UC-
AFT), believes that the recent Su-
preme Court decision will help aid 
the legal battle to open files in 
California. 

"I think the University of Penn-
sylvania Supreme Coun decision 
[dctennines) that academic insti-
tutions will have to bebave," he 
said. , 

According to Adest, the Su-
preme Court case Peter SchDrf et 
al v. the Regellls of tile University 
of California was originally filed 
10 years ago on behalf of academ-
ics and one admioistrator who were 
denied tenure by the peer review 
process and believed tbat there 
were things in their files they could 

have rebutted had they been 
given access. 

'1be intent of [Scharf v. UC 
Regents] was to get the Univer-
sity to comply with the Infonna-
tiODS Practices Act, the Califor-
nia Education Code (section 
92612), and the due process 
requirement of the United States 
Constitution," Adest said. 

In the initial trial, the judge 
ruled in favor of the University, 
saying that it was allowed to 
keep the information in question 
confidential. 

Schar/v. UC Regenrs is now 
under the jurisdiction of the Cal i-
fomia Court of AppealS. Ac-
cording to Adest, the appeal is 
based on the California 
Constitution's guaranteed right 
to privacy, the constitutional

ietnam Memorial Photographs 

Will Be Displayed at Price Center 
Sixty-three photographs in an exhibition titled, "The 

Vietnam Veterans Memorial Photographed by Sal Lopes" 
will be on.display at the Price Center, in Galleries A and 
B, until March II. 

The exhibition is open to the public Saturdays and 
Sundays, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. There is no admission 
fee. 

Lopes, a photojournalist, spent many hours at the 
memorial since it was dedicated on Nov. II, 1982, 
photographing veterans and their families as they came 
to look, touch, and experience the two black granite, V-
shaped walls bearing the names of 58,156 Vietnam 
casualties. 

Lopes's work captures people in acts of mourning. 
Some leave behind artifacts from the dead person 's life: 
a teddy bear, medals, photographs, a wedding ring. Often 
visitors leave letters to their loved ones. People come 
with paper and crayon to make rubbings of the names; 
others photograph them. 

Theexhibition was originally organized by the Chrys-
ler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia. Participation fees were 
funded by UCSD's University Center Board. 

Latin American Studies Center 
Receives $550,000 Mellon Grant 

UCSD's Center for Iberian and Latin American Stud-
ies (Cll.AS) has received a grant for $550,000 from the 
Andrew W. Mellon foundation to promote the study of 
Latin America from a global, comparative perspective. 

"This generous grant from the Mellon Foundation 
will make a powerful contribution to the field of Latin 
American studies at UCSD," said Peter H. Smith, the 
director of CILAS. "And it will enable us to search for 
new ways of understanding Latin America's role in the 
changing world arena." 

Implementation of the Mellon grant will begin with 
the development of three major streams of new research 
on Latin America: political democratization amid socio-
economic crises, the breakdown and transformation of 
one-party regimes, and Latin America's emerging rela-
tionship with the Pacific Rim. 

According to Smith, the funds from the five-year

In addition to CILAS, several other on-campus aca-
demic re ources for Latin American studies will be 
involved in activities under the Mellon Program. They 
include: the Graduate School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies (IR/PS), the Center for U.S.-Mexi-
can Studies, and the Institute of the Americas, a private 
organization that works closely with the University.

Committee For World Democracy 
To Show Three Films On Friday 

The Commillee for World Democracy political film 
series will show " Hopi: Songs of the Foulth World" on 
Friday at TLH 110 at 7 p.m. The film explores the Hopi 
and their philosophy of living life in balance with nature. 
The film is a study that captures the Hopi 's deep spiritu-
ality and reveals their integration of art and daily life. 
Amidst images of Hopi land and life, a variety of Hopi 
speak about the preservation of the Hopi way. 

Two other films will also be shown. "An Acquired 
Taste" is about a filmaker who turns 40 and casts a wry 
look back at the influences which have shaped his life 
(and all of our lives) through four decades. 

"Inside Life Outside," follows a group of homeless 
people living in a shantytown on New York's lower East 
Side.

New Berkeley Chancellor Selected 

54 year-old Chinese-born Chang-Lin Tien, an inter-
nationally recognized engineer, scientist, research scholar 
and award-winning teacher, has been selected by the UC 
Regents as the seventh chancellor to head UC Berkeley's 
campus. 

The Regents confJmled UC President David Gardner's 
recommendation on Feb. IS at their business meeting at 
UCSF's Laurel Heights campus. 

Tien, who is in his second year as executive vice 
Chancellor at UC Irvine, will take over administration of 
UCB on July I, succeeding Ira Michael Heyman, who 
announced his intent to resign last fall after 10 years as 
Chancellor. 

Tien was selected after a six-month national search 
that resulted in more than 250 applicants and nominees. 
He is believed to be the first person of Asian ancestry to 
be chosen to head a major research university in the 
United States. 

"I can imagine no greater honor than to serve as the 
Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley," 
Tien said. "This appointment is an expression of com-
mittment to the Berkeley faculty and to the University 's 
increasingly multicultural population." 

While at Berkeley, Tien served for three years (1983-
86) as vice chancellor of research, and during that time 
the campus' yearly tOLal for government and private 
support of research grew 10 over $1 00 million for the fust 
time. He was chair for seven years (1974-81) of 
Berkeley 's Department of Mechanical Engineering. 

Born in China, Tien studied at a private school in 
Shanghai and graduated in mechanical engineering from 
National Taiwan University in 1955, later becoming a 
naturalized United States citizen.

Affirmative Action Research 
Program Seeks Undergraduates 

The ninth Summer Undergraduate Affinnative Ac-
tion Research Program (SUAARP) will be held at UC 
Davis from June 18 to Aug. 10. This program provides 
students with research opponunities in the biological, 
agricultural, and resource sciences. While SUAARP is 
open to all qualified students, it is primarily intended for 
minorities, women and other disadvantaged students 
who have completed their junior year in college. 

Students spend eight weeks on the UCD campus 
working under the supervision of a faculty mentor on a 
research project of mutual interest. Each student will be 
treated as an integral member of the research team , 
panicipating in all lab-related activities. 

In addition to receiving five quarter units of independ-
ent research credit and a $2,000 stipend, each student 
will receive a scholarship to cover all travel expenses, 
room, and board. Applicants are limited to U.S. ci tizens 
and permanent immigrants. Students will be selected on 
the basis of their academic record, letter of recommen-
dation and a statement of interest. 

The appl ication deadline for the program is March I.

Bum-like injuries of the type 
found on the defendant' s fingers, 
Rivers testified, could have been 
produced either by contact or fric -

pains to underscore- and could, 
conceivably, have been the result 
of strangling someone with a phone 
cord. 

Rivers said, in respon e to que-
ries by Assistant District Attorney

on the decedent 's neck was one-

on the hand of an attacker.

According to testimony given

Department detective who interro-
gated Richardson, the defendant 
said he dropped Marie Richardson 
off at work on Dec. 20 and then 
went to a UCSD library to study 
for an exam before returning to El 
Cajon close to noon. 

According to Rooney , 
Richardson was on academic pro-
bation at the time for having failed 
the medical clerkship exam he was 
scheduled to re-take on Dec. 21. 
Richard on also had an outstand-

A main point of contention 
during the meeting concerned a

ment to "respect international law" 
and "terminate all intervention" in 
Latin American countries. 

Third College SenalOr Larry

he could not support it because it 
did not necessarily represent the 
opinions of his constituents.

A.S. Follies 

The Death Of TGs? 
Some people in the administration consider TGs an anachro-

nism. Fifteen times a year, students get together, drink free beer 
and sit on the hump, talking to friends and watching a band. This 
is unique, says Assistant Vice Chancellor Tom Tucker. 

There's two ways to look at that: Either TGs are unique 
because other universities would never consider staging such 
foolish events, or - perhaps, just perhaps - we may have a real 
tradition here. UCSD is a young, growing university, so it isn't 
surprising that it is short on tradition and long on "progress." But 
TGs are a genuine tradition, and repre ent a ingular unifying 
element on a diverse campus. 

Butnow-to review for those of you who haven't been paying 
attention - a new problem threatens the existence of TGs. That 
was not the purpo e in the beginning; ironically, Associate 

Students President John Ramirez's 
original purpose was to have TOs 
reflect the diversity of UCSD. But 
he went about it in the wrong way, 
trying to set a quota of "cultural" 
TGs. and, in the end, running rough-
shod over another elected official , 
A.S. Commissioner of Programming 
Matt Schnurer. 

John Ramirez 

Controversy about TOs certainJy 
puts them at risk. Now, however, 
Ramirez has made matters even 

worse. Tucker, who is responsible for signing the forms to allow 
TGs to take place, has indicated he will not sign if the TO does 
not meet Ramirez's criteria, and one source has said Tucker may 
even halt TGs until the issue is resolved. 

The frightening element in all of this is that it may spell the end 
of TGs all together. There are some 
who would use any excuse to put a 
stop to them, a panicularly heart-
breaking notion in a year where the 
TGs have been exceptionally good. 
TGs are one of the few genuine 
campus-wtde social events. 

Ramirez has set a dangerous prece-
dent by running to an administrator 
to help him circumvent another 
elected student representative. But 
the real problem is that he may have Matt Schnurer 

let a fox into the chickenhouse, and the interests of the students 
will be subverted. 

This issue has festered, and has become a focus for a large 
amount of divisiveness on the A.S. Council. Hate-filled com-
ments have flown, with one programming committee member 
allegedly saying another was out of touch with her race. This sort 
of verbal abuse has no place in the Associated Students. 

If groups want to program culturally diverse events, they 
should go to the A.S. and ask for funds. Then they should do the 
work in organizing the event. But they apparently don't want to 
work; they want Schnurer to somehow bring big name ethnic 
musical groups to the campus, and they seem oblivious to the fact 
that Schnurer was elected to program for all the students. not just 
a vocal few. 111ese groups have been unresponsive to requests to 
suggest bands, and the suggestions they do make are big-name 
bands that are far too expensive. 

By trying to tum TGs into educational events that serve their 
political ends, they may be killing the golden goose. And ifTGs 
do die, on the death certificate under "cause of death" they can 
write "A.S. President John Ramirez." 

Printing Suicide Story Was Irresponsible 
Editor: 

I was deeply infuriated when I 
read about the Revelle student ' s 
suicide (Revelle Senior Commits 
Suicide Off Bridge," Feb. 15) 
What upset me wasn't the fact 
that he committed suicide, it was 
the fact that you had the audacity 
to print it. 

who is severely depressed doesn't 
know that. They, at this point, 
can' t even think straight. They see 
no other way out. 

What gives you the right, just 
because of your First Amendment 
"rights to freedom of speech," to 
play around wi th people's lives 
like that? The answer is that you 
don't. 

I have several severely de-
pressed friends who have already 
either tried or have talked about 

committing uicide. Although they 
are seeking help professionally, it 
only takes a small thing like th is 
article to push them back to the 
edge or even over it. 

The printing of this article, es-
pecial ly placing it on the front 
page, was a careless act on the part 
of Guardian editors. If anything 
happens to my friends, I hold the 
members of the Guardian com-
pletely responsible. 

Gregory Mathiews 

It is a proven fact that ruJUling 
articles on suicides leads to a rip-
pling effect. This has been cited 
in several articles on suicide, 
appearing in a variety of publica-
tions from newspapers and psy-
chological magazines to Seven-
teen magazine. 

Enough Parking Gripes 
An already severely depressed 

individual who reads an article 
such as the one you've printed 
could find that it romanticizes the 
idea of suicide and will most likely 
take his or her own life. 

Although there is nothing ro-
mantic about suicide, a person

flipping through back issues of 
The Guardian (saved for recy-

In the course of my seemingly 
innocent leafing, I, using my keen 
powers of observation, noticed an 
annoying, yet repetitive feature in 

Responsibility is the Answer 
Editor: 

Tracy Powell is right in her commentary ("It Can Be Tough To Be 
Black at UCSD," Feb. 12) when she points out that "someone else's 
altitude problem" should not be allowed to interfere with one's personal 
goals. And yet, there lurks a far more inhibiting source of attitude 
problems, a source more damaging than the collective or individual 
prejudices of onlookers. That source is oneself. 

The example of the black freshman (used in Ms. Powell's commen-
tary) who, upon entering the filled lecture hall, utters the poignant 
words, "Dang, I'm the only one in here!" illustrates the point. What 
attitude problem does this exclamation reveal? The problem is this: One 
human being stands within a roomful of many human beings and yet 
willfully, emotionally, remains outside. The student sees only "them," 
a body foreign to "one's own kind." In a world of such diverse material , 
intellectual, and spiritual origins, yet so alike in the qualities that make 
people people, how lonely this must be! How circumscribed, how 
isolating, how self-defeating a life! Where does the more influential 
"attitude problem"begin - outside or inside? Which is the more inhib-
iting factor? The freshman's primary alienation arises not from others' 
attitudes, but from having not, instinctively, placed his/her humanity 
first - first before the sub-category of race, first before the secondary, 
external rhythms of cultural history and background. 

The commentator is right when she implies that each individual must 
take responsibility for self-advancement by not letting others' ignorance 
deter one's pace. But let each one carry this wisdom further. Let each 
rout out his or her own personal ignorance, thereby doffing the colorful 
bull's-eye labelled "victim." IfI am not a target, the arrows of another's 
stupidity will miss their mark. If 1 do not stand apart (by my own 
separative attitudes) from my fellow humankind, my fellow humankind 
will be more likely to embrace me.

the Opinion section: UCSD stu-
dents complaining about the park-
ing "problem." 

Too little student parking, too 
much faculty parking, lower fees , 
raised parking structures, etc., ad 
nauseum. quid pro (Latin, the 
languageofscholars- addscredi-
bility to any paper). 

Let us review the complaints 
together. The main gripe is that 
there's not enough student park-
ing. I drove around campus today 
and observed the parking situation 
first hand (It's not a hobby of 
mine, really). 

It was difficult to find empty 
spaces in all the "prime spots," 
i.e., any parking space one can 
park in 13.5 seconds before class 
starts and still make it in time. 
Sure there's plenty of parking in 
lot 504 (that's northeast of War-
ren for those of you not up on 
parking lot numerology), but how 
could anyone park out there and 
possibly expect to get to class in 
time? 

Easily. I live at Warren and, 
granted, it is located, distance-
wise, somewhere on Jupiter (that's 
northeast of Mars forthose of you 
not up on astronomy), but I still 
manage, by: 

a. some miracle 
b. an unexplained act of Ood

structor wraps up lecture. Okay, 
so you can't find parking right on 
the doorstep of your class. Then 
you have two options: plan for 
extra time to park further away or 

tunity, park your car in a parking 
spot quite close to your dorm/ 
apartment, lock your keys in it, 
and leave the cursed beast there 
until summertime, voila! No more 
trouble finding that elusive close, 
safe spot. When summervacation 
rolls around, have your parental

skip class (the latter is the better 
option, but you didn' t hear it from 
me). 

The danger of walking long 
distances at night (where there are 
no lights, no people for miles, 
plenty of hiding places for evil 
types, parking waving money and 
shouting "I'm alone, assaultme!") 
is a real issue to be concerned 
with. 

Even though UCSD is the saf-
est area in San Diego, the students 
still don't feel safe. Should we 
offer people that are less able to 
defend themselves special park-
ing that is very close to the dorms/ 
apartments, say, right next to the 
handicapped spots? 

Nab, probably wouldn' t work, 
we would have to beat up every~ 
body in order to determine who 
deserved the "helpless" parking 
spots. 

My advice: at your next oppor-

units bring you a spare set of keys. 
"But, how will I get any-

where?" Let someone else drive 
(takes the ozone off of your con-
science). In all seriousness, just 
don ' t go out alone at night, withor 
without a car, and the Noid will 
never get you. 

Vou think the facul ty has all 
the best spots on campus? Do you 
feel that the Regents are taking 
student spaces and giving them to 
teachers? "Call [protester Arnie] 
Schoenberg! Call his lawyers! We 
are being repressed!" 

Whoa, put the phone down a 
second. Relax and take a look at 
your professors. I have a few who 
have trouble making it up lecture 
halI stairs. much less walking any 
substantial distance to get to their 
car, so give 'em a break.

with me. Not to mention having to 
put up with you. Pursuing Diversity at UCSD 

So there's not enough close 
parking. Big deal! I think it's about 
time that UCSD students wake up 
and take a good look around. Most 
colleges across the country do not 
allow any underclassmen to have 
cars on campus at all. Feel lucky, 
not restricted. 

For you who feel the fees are 
too high, follow these simple in-
structions. Determine how much 
you are willing to pay for parking. 
Put the money in a bank and leave 
your car at home. 

In short, pull that damn silver 
spoon out of your mouth and stick 
it somewhere else. Realize, UCSD, 
that we have it better than most 
other students in America.

Ed itor: 
Last week several letters came 

out defending the A .S. Council in 
its pursuit of creating culturally 
diverse TOs. T commend the ef-
fort of the council in creating 
diverse social events, but I would 
also like to assert that they are 
merely scratching the surface 
while at the same time focusing 
their attention on the wrong per-
son, i.e. Matt Schnurer. 

UCSD professes to be an insti-
tution of higher education, yet 
there is no campus-wide ethnic or 
gender studies requirement.Now, 
there are those who would say 
that if I wanted diversity I should 
go to Third. But that is entirely 
wrong. 

For too long now the curricu-
lum at Third has stood as an ear-

mark for this university. Third lets 
them off the hook. The admini-
stration can say: "Look, we have 
diversity -look at Third." 

But Third students are not the 
only ones who need to be taught 
about cultural sensitivity. Anyone 
who wants to function in this 
society, this multi-racial Ameri-
can society, must understand the 
people around them. For too long, 
students have been taught courses 
from thepointofviewofthedomi-
nant society. If the goal of this 
institution is to educate and pre-
pare us forthe "real world," then it 
is imperitive that we are taughtthe 
basics of understanding and ac-
cepting the different cultures that 
exist in the world. 

This brings me to the A.S. The 
leiter from Vanness Harris (" A.S. 
Council Should Control Program-
ing," Feb .. IS) persecutes Mati for 
not providing a di versity of TOs 
to all of the students. 

While it is important to have 
diverse social events, it is even 
more important to have cultural 
understanding/sensitivity. Ra-
cism/sexism/cultural misunder-
standings stem from ignorance. 
Ignorance can be cured with edu-
cation. 

In 10 years, Matt Schnurer and 
the TOs will be gone. But racism 
and sexism will remain. If it is the 
intent of this A.S. to leave behind 
a legacy ,letitbeone in which they 
were the first to demand from the 
administration a campus-wide 
ethnic/gender studies requirement 
for all students.

GROUPS 
Continued from page 1 

According to Nelson, people in 
leadership positions should be held 
especially responsible for their 
actions, because students who use 
racial slurs are imitating behavior 
learned from their mentors. 

The message the Fighting Word 
Policy sends, according to Nelson, 
"is that we have other ways of 
expressing anger without taking it 
out on other people." 

Nelson feels that when students 
see their leaders punished for us-
ing fighting words they will "be-
come aware of this message." 

She pointed to the recent sus-
pension of CBS New commenta-
tor Andy Rooney, for alleged de-
rogatory comments against gays 
and blacks, as evidence that soci-
ety is tolerating the use of racial 
slurs less and less. 

"This message that the use 
derogatory comments is 
able is for everyone,

tion League aplplaluds 
ties' efforts to eXI)enme 
proper mechanism to deal wlltrnll_ll:J; 
issue," Casu to said. 

According to Casuto, the 
League feels that verbal attacks 
can lead to conflicts in some cir-
cumstances. 

"There are people who believe 
that Jewish American Princess 
(JAP) jokes are protected under 
the Constitution. These people 
don't think that these jokes hann 
anyone; we don', see this so 
benignly. We have sccn these types 
of jokes lead to conflicts," he said. 

Casuto said the Jewish Anti-
Defamation League is as yet un-
cenain of its position on the fight-
ing words question, but is advocat-
ing education of students on racial 
and gender issues. 

"If it sounds like we are not sure 
how to approach this, you are right. 
This is not a simple issue, and there 
are no simple solutions," Casuto 

said. 
The American Civil Liberties 

Union, though acknowledging 
what it views as a need for UC 
actions aimed at ending discrimi-
nation, is decrying the Fighting 
Words Policy as a violation of 
students' First Amendment free 
speech rights. 

According to Betty Wheeler, 
the legal director for a local office 
of the ACLU, the organization has 
reviewed the Fighting Words Pol-
icy and has deemed it "unconstitu-
tional because it infringes on free-
dom of speech rights guaranteed 
by the First Amendment." 

"We are trying to get the policy 
changed," Wheeler said. 

The ACLU is concerned that 
the policy will limit students' p0-
litical speech. It has also expressed 
apprehension over the wording of 
the section of the policy stating 

ili~ ~ 

ally do so. 
Wheelersaid there is still a fight-

ing words doctrine in the Ameri-
can legal system, under which "an 

immedi~e threat of inciting vio-
lence" is forbidden. Wheeler be· 
lieves that the UC's attempt to 
implement a fighting words policy 
stems from the " University's Ie· 
gitimate concern for students' 
educational atmosphere" so that 
all students will have an equal 
opponunity to succeed in the insti-
tution. 

Wheeler said the ACLU advo-
cates "affmnative steps to elimi-
nate racist, gender-biased speech 
on campus." 

"There are lots of ways the 
University can take affinnative 
steps so that all students can have 

The UCSD Guardian 

equal education without respect to 
their race," she said. 

Wheeler said that such steps 
can be taken without recourse to a 
disciplinary policy and said the 
ACLU is calling on campus ad-
minislrators to "speak. out against 
such derogatory speech, and call 
for multicultural diversity on 
campuses. " 

So far, there is no indication 
that this is a problem on UC cam-
puses, Wheeler said. 

She added that administrators 
should promote additions of core 
curriculum classes which will leach 
students about the histories and 
struggles of various ethnic groups 
represented in the United Stales. 
She also suggested the encourage-
ment of extracurricular activities 
"which teach about racism, the 
history of racism, sexism, and 
group-based racism." 

"We think this will change

neeci to take a close look. at all

described in the Fighting Words 
Policy to contact the ACLU," she 
said. 

Wheeler emphasized her view 
that, even thougb steps need to be 
taken to alleviate the problem of 
racial, gender, and sexual bias on 
college campuses, those steps 
should not include punishing stu-
dents for exercising their free 
speech rights under the First 
Amendment. 

"There has been a real rise in 
racist incidents, and that is a very 
real problem. Equal educational 
opportunities for all students is a 
very serious issue, but these issues 
need to be resolved by affinnative 
measures," she said.

Margarita, Candy 
and CigareHe Vendor 
Q: What do you think. of American tourists? 
A: Well, you get all types, like the one just a moment ago who tried 
to take a lighter without paying for it. Some behave well, some 
don't. One has to pay attention. 
Q: How does the V.S. Border Patrol affect you? 
A: It doesn't really affect me at all. 
Q: How long do you work? 
A: On the weekends, } open at 11 :00 a.m. and close at 3:00 a.m. 
Q: Is it diffiCUlt? 
A: Yes. I get very little sleep, but if I only work during the day, I 
wouldn 't make enough money. 
Q: Do you make enough to live on? 
A: Yes, luckily, I do well enough. I have no complaints. 
Q: What is the difference between day and night visitors? 
A: Well, at night one has to be careful because quite a few of them 
have been drinking and some don't stay in control. 
Q: What have YOII heard about Mexicans' probLems ill the U.S . with 
regards to violence and racism? 
A: I bave heard how they treat them through the news or through 
newspapers. 
Q: Do YOll (hink they're treated well or poorly? 
A: Well, in terms of racism I hear they're treated poorly, but my 
experience has been that people treat you the way you treat them. If 
you behave well, they will treat you well. I don't understand why 
they would treat the Mexican workers differently. 
Q: How does tile Immigratioll alld Naturalization Service treat 
Mexicans? 
A: They treat them poorly. You hear about assaults and exton ion all 
the time. 
Q: Do you think there are racist morivatiollS behind those actiollS? 
A: Maybe there are, but to be fair, one doesn't know how the 
Mexicans were behaving at the time. Some definitely give good 
reason to be treated poorly. Some might be racist. 
Q: Have you ever thought of living in the U.S.? 
A: No, because I have a problem: I'm missing a leg and I have to 
walk on crutches and my position here is at least stable. If I had a 
clear opportunity 1 would live there, but otherwise it is too uncer-
tain. 
Q: Do you have any comments or questiollS? 
A: } have a Mexican passpon which enables me to visit. If I wanted 
to live there permanently, how would I be able to obtain the 
papers? 
Q: I wouldn' ( be able TO answer you . 
A: What would I work as in the U.S.? That is why I have never 
thought of going there. 
Q: How do they treat you in Ihe U.S.? 
A: They treat me well. The places where I shop know me by now 
and they treat me quite well. I've been crossing the border for 10 
years now. 
Q: Have the tourists changed over the years? 
A: No, they're the same as everywhere else. You see all sorts of 
personalities. It's the same for Mexicans, Americans, EngJish-
everybody's the same.

Revoluci6n Comments 
The following are excerpts from various interviews on 

Tijuana's Avenida de Revoluci6n: 

Riverside Construction Worker, AIJe 25 
"We came down here to get really drunk, you know. And 

hopefully find some nice girls and start from there .... We' re 
getting drunk to g~t our attitudes up .... 

"It reminds me of some kind of Third World country. Like, 
I've been allover. You guys want a beer? We're buying. I've 
been all over the world so this is nothing new to me. It reminds 
me of L.A. because there are so many Americans. 

"When I go down to Baja, I bring my 4x4, and my din bike. 
Kick back on the beach and ride back, camp out, ya know. We 
usually get about 50 friends. We all have bikes, motorcycles, 
lot of beer, a lot of firewood, a lot of good food. Party! 

"I think that they should tear down the border and make 
Mexico a part of the United States. Make it one world." 

Should it all be America or a neutral country? 
"All be America. All freedom. We' ll kill all the commies. 

Go down to Honduras. You know. And, just do it. America's 
Number One and we know it. It's the best fuckin ' place in the 
world." 

Tijuana T-Shirt Salesman 
What is your impressioll of life ill San Diego ? 
"I really couldn't say becaue I've neverlived there. I don't 

have a passpon." 
How does the proximity of the US. affect you:' 
"It affects me becau e the majority of our shoppers are 

American." 
What is YOllr affill/de towards the people that come to the 

bars? 
"Well, I think most ofthem are minors because the drinking 

age is lower." 
How do they behave? 
"Frankly, a lot of them come down here to raise hell." 

Point Loma College Student, A{Je 20 
"As far as the cleanliness in Tijuana, I don't think it's too 

clean. It's diny. Streets are dirty. Foul air. It's just filthy as far 
as dirt .... There are too many aliens in San Diego and L.A., 
period. megal aliens. Just allover the place. Working. Bums. 

"They come and just take jobs from the American public." 

Sailor, ". 20 
"I play V-ball and get drunk. Basically, that's about it. It 

gives people who are under 21 something to do." 

Canadian Retiree 
"The trouble 'with U.S. and Canada is that people won 't 

shine shoes. While here you can still come here and get a good 
shoeshine for a dollar. At home we can't get a good $1 shine 
because people get unemployment insurance. And why should 
they shine shoes? Here everyone's still doing it because they 
don't have those benefits. Everyone's an entrepeneur." 

Anaheim College Student, Aee 19 
"We have to recognize it is necessary to protect our borders. 

We have to keep America strong. " 
What's the first word that comes to your mind when I say 

TijuafUJ? 
"Freedom. You can do whatever you want down here."

Headaches: 
A Common Source of Pain 
By PAUL REYNOLDS 
UCSB Daily Nexus 

After hunger and fatigue, head-
ache is the most common discom-
fort experienced by Americans, and 
ranks among the top five com-
plaints heard by family doctors. 

In a study of 1,000 worker, 77 
percent complained of some kind 
of regular or occasional head pain, 
with 22 percent stating that it was 
severe enough to interfere with 
their work, However, of those af-
fected just 11 percent sought pro-
fessional treatment for it. 

There are two major types of 
headache: the migraine and the 
tension, or muscle-contraction 
headache. 

The migraine, which is more 
common in women than men, 
usually involves a recurring, throb-
bing, unilateral head pain, often 
accompanied by vomiting, irrita-
bility and neura-motor dysfunc-
tions. Sufferers also often experi-
ence a severe sensitivity to light. 

The classical migraine often 
begins with sensory and visual 
symptoms which can take the form 
of flashing lights, tingling sensa-
tions, mood swings, loss of sight, 
loss of speech or paralyzation. The 
symptoms generally disappear 
within 30 minutes and the head-
ache sets in. 

Although they usually pass 
within a few hours, a classical 

migraine can last up to one day. 
In the common migraine the 

presymptoms are absent, the head-
ache is more frequent and longer, 
often lasting for days at a time. It 
commonly sets in while the victim 
is sleeping, and intensi fies through-
out the day. Like the classical 
migraine, the common migraine is 
accompanied by nausea and vom-
iting. 

There are three other, rarer, 
types of migraines: the Basilar 
Artery, Ophthalmologic , and 
Hemiplegic Migraines. 

Migraines are generally be-
lieved to be caused by a narrowing 
and then dilation of the blood ves-
sels in the head. "There is general 
agreement that cranial vasodilata-
tion (blood vessel expansion) is a 
. .. state that is necessary for occur-
rence of the migraine headache 
anack," according to The Common 
Headache, by Dr. Adrian M. 
Ostfeld. 

Attacks may be aggravated by 
hypertension, hunger, alcohol,lack 
or excess of sleep, caffeine with-
drawal, and noise, and often occur 
more frequently during allergy 
season, according to Doctor Cyn-
thiaBowers, an intemist at UCSB's 
Student Health Services. 

There also appears to be a con-
nection between migraines and 
hormonal fluctuations in the 
sufferer's body, as witnessed by

Headache 
Continued from page 10 
the fact that many women experi-
ence migraines as a part of their 
menstrual cycle. These often de-
crease or disappear initially during 
pregnancy which could also be due 
to hormonal changes, OrlO unchar-
acteristic relaxation during this 
time. 

It has been found that migraine 
sufferers often have personalities 
tending toward perfectionism, ri-
gidity, and sustained emotional 
stress. A 1977 study found that 
migraine patients maintain a con-
tinuously high level of muscle 
contraction in their head muscles. 
Yet not all people with these quali-
ties suffer from migraines, and not 
all suffers have these characteris-
tics. 

Treatment for migraines varies, 
with a wide range of drugs being 
used successfully. The most effec-
tive drug is ergotamine tartrate, a 
fungus derivative, which must be 
taken immediately after the first 
symptoms. It is not effective on 
other types of headache. 

Other drugs, such as beta- and 
calcium~hannel blockers and anti-
depressants can be taken to hel p 
prevent the occurrence, but often 
have unwanted side effects. 

Migraine treatment methods, 
which don't involve medication, 
include psychotherapy and behav-
ior modification. Autogenic bio-
feedback training has also received 
extensive use. In a study of 413 
AS-trained migraine sufferers, 90 
percent said they felt they had been 
helped to relax, 32 percent thought 
that their headaches had ben helped 
for a limited period of time, and 3 
percent felt that they had been 
helped permanently. 

Acupuncture has been found 
helpful as both a pain killer and as 
therapy . According to some 
sources, as many as one-third of all 
acupuncture patients seek treat-
ment for headaches. 

In addition to migraim:s, other 
types of vasodilating headaches 
exist, including the cluster head-
ache, histamine cephalalgia, 
Horton's headache, and atypical 
facial neuralgia. These headaches 
begin in middle age, and are more 
common in men than women. The 
attacks come in clusters of one or 
more per day for several days, and 
are followed by long symptom-
free periods. The cycle continues 
for years, with attacks getting pro-
gressively longer, and the inter-
vals shorter. The pain is always 
unilateral, and occurs on the same 
side of the face within a given 
cluster. These headaches are treated 
with various drugs. 

The tension headache is by far . 
the most common headache of all. 
Fewer than 10 percent of Ameri-
cans have never felt a tension head-
ache. 

Symptoms of a tension head-
ache are a dull steady ache, a feel-
ing of tightness, pain that does not 
pulsate, and is bilateral through the 
head, occasionally accompanied by 
sore muscles in the neck, face,jaw, 
temple, or shoulders. These usu-
ally occur at times of psychologi-
cal tension, intense concentration 
or physical strain, andean be caused 
by muscle strain, poor posture, 
anxiety, or stress. 

Treatments include: aspirin and 
other analgesics, physical therapy 

such as heat and massage, exer-
cises, posture correction, biofeed-
back, acupuncture, electrical stimu-
lation, and in extreme conditions, 
injections of anesthetic or corti-
sone. 

Many people also experience a 
type oftension headache which is 
exercise-related. This is very com-
mon, and is believed to be caused 
by sustained muscular tension in 
the head and neck, occurring from 
such acti vities as hanging the head 
down during bicycling. The best 
treatment for this is massage, or 
application of ice. To prevent this 
type of headache, doctors recom-
mend bui lding up the neck muscles. 

At UCSB, headaches are com-
mon. During her two years at Stu-
dent Health Services, Cynthia 
Bowers has found that most people 
who come in fortreatrnent ofhead-
aches have a "combination" head-
ache, incorporating parts of both 
the migraine and tension varieties. 

It is uncommon to find a stu-
dent who does not have occasional 
headaches, she said, but there is a 
smaller percentage of the campus 
for which these are chronic. 

Bowers said that 90 percent of 

The UCSD Guardian 

her diagnoses are based upon the 
patient's history. People with 
unusual answers to her diagnostic 
questions are referred on to further 
testing. While headaches with se-
rious cases such as brain tumors 
are rare in young people, they can 
occur. 

In treating headaches, Bowers 
said she tries to find the largest 
single factor contributing to the 
headache, or current precipitating 
problem. If this problem can be 
fixed, it is likely that the headache 
will go away. In 30 to 40 percent of 
patients, a fixable cause can be 
found. 

If the problem is psychological 
or stress, the patient is sent to 
counselling or stress management. 
If nothing else is found, treatment 
is started with intermittent analge-
sics, or other drugs. 

Bowers said she is seriously 
concerned, however, with people 
who freq uently take analgesics for 
headaches, because even a small 
dosage can cause kidney damage. 

"Too many people in this day 
and age think that they can get 
away from taking care of them-
selves by taking a pill," Bowers 

FEATURES II 

said. 
No one should avoid seeing a 

doctor for fear that theirquestion is 
trivial or that they will sound para-

noid or stupid, she said, and people 
cannot be expected to diagnose 
themselves.

A Postseason Berth 
For Men's Basketball? 
Don't Count On It 

Somehow. it seems like every-
thing gets screwed up in the East. 
Whole political systems are over-
thrown, charges of bribery in gov-
ernment are rampant, and West 
Coast powers are left off Division 
ill postseason invitation lists. 

With all the politics involved, it 
won't be difficult to believe if the 
East Coast powers that be leave the 

BRIAN ITOW 
Triton men's basketball team off 
their list of 40 invitees to their 
Grand Ball. 

On Sunday night or Monday 
morning, the team will find out if it 
has been selected to this Grand 
Ball - the 4O-team NCAA Na-
tional Tournament - the first 
round of which begins on the 
weekend of March 2. All signs 
would seem to point towards 
postseason play for the Tritons. 

At 20-5, the UCSDmen's bas-
ketball team is having the best year 
in its history. The Tritons. ranked 
15th in the nation. are one of only 
two West Region teams currently 
ranked in the top 20. 

Yet somehow, they are only 
tied for second in the region with 
Menlo College and Nebraska 
Wesleyan. 

Tho e signs which appeared to 
be leading the Tritons towards the 
promised land may actually be 
directing them down a one-way 
street with a banicade. 

Four teams from the region are 
guaranteed a place in the tourna-
ment. The Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
(SCIAC) champion, and the win-
ners of leagues in Minnesota and 
Iowa will each get an automatic 
benh. That leaves one guaranteed 
benh to an independent school. 

History shows us that Nebraska 
Wesleyan is one of the few West-
ern Region teams with success in 
the national tournament. Combine 
that with the fact that its coach sits 
on the West Region selection com-
mittee, and a berth for Nebraska 
Wesleyan is probably in the bag. 

DIVISION I 
Continued from page 15 
come from in so small a budget. 

The third problem - that there 
is no long tenn plan in the works 
for an eventual change - is most 
disheartening. The administration 
and staff are still committed to a 
Division ill program and see no 
reason to move. They speak of the 
intrinsic reward the tudent par-
ticipants receive from our present 
system. 

Although they don 't entirely 
rule out the possibility of UCSD 
becoming a Division I program in 
the future, they are careful not to 
raise any cain. 

Here is where lies the duty of 
the UCSD community. As a uni-
versity, we must want our athletic 
program to change. We need to 
organize as a group so that we may 
lobby effectively for Division I 
spon s at our school. 

ButIdon'tknow if we have it in 

There is a possibility that the 
region ('ould secure one - or even 
two - more benhs in the tourna-
ment. If two more are selected, 
then both the Tritons and Menlo 
College will probably make it. 
However, it is more likely that 
only one of them will. 

That will leave the selection 
committee with an extremely tough 
decision between the two well-
qualified schools. To make its 
choice, the committee will enlist 
three main criteria: strength of 
schedu Ie, overall record. and head-
to-head competition. 

Despite playing one of the 
toughest schedules in Divis ion ill, 
the 20-5 Tritons still boast a better 
record than the 19-7 Menlo Oaks. 
However, they lost two of three 
games to Menlo this year, a factor 
that could loom large in the final 
selection. Another factor which 
may loom would be a loss to Divi-
sion I USIU on Saturday. 

The center of power in Division 
ill sports is in the east. 252 of the 
286 schools participating in Divi-
sion ill athletics are located east of 
the Mississippi or in Texas. The 
few teams left in the We t are 
given little respect. This notion has 
been illustrated time and again. 

In 1986-87, the Tritons, despite 
finishing 18-8 and posting wins 
over national finalist Clark Col-
lege and Division I U.S. Interna-
tional University, were not invited 
to the tournament. 

In 1988, Cal State San Bernar-
dino beat just about everyone who 
knocked on its door. At 20-4, they 
finished with one of the best rec-
ords in the nation. Yet they still 
couldn ' t buy a bid. 

"If the purpose of the to urna-
ment is to select the best teams, 
then we will definitely be in." 
UCSD Head Coach Tom Marshall 
said. "But sometimes I question 
whether that really is its purpose." 

Whatever the reasoning, don't 
be surprised if this year's men's 
basketball team fi nds out that it 
will be spending the rest of W inter 
Quarter al home. 

us to mount the necessary support 
for our athletic program, as wit-
nessed by the RIMAC election. 
That is even more disheartening. 

A change to big-time college 
athletics will undoubtably be a long 
and arduous process, as )Ve will 
probably have to move to Division 
n before we can go higher. But we 
need to stan sometime. and we 
need to find a place somewhere ... 
so why not here and now?! 

We can look to schools like 
Stanford and Duke: universities 
oursize that haven ' tsacrificed edu-
cational standards for accomplish-
ments in the gym or the field. Even 
Cal State Nonhridge. which has 
developed a program dedicated 10 
making the change from Division 
n to Division I. presents itself to us 
as a fine example. 

From examples like the e, we 
can start the ball rolling in the 
direction ofa more exciting spons 
program that doesn't compromise 
academics in the name of athletics.

for women's tennis, both our soc-
cer teams each won a national title 
over the last two seasons, our swim 
teams consistently finish among 
the top three SPOIS in the nation, 
and our golf, track and field, cross 
country, and men's tennis teams 
are on the rise. Other spons, such 
as baseball and softball. are main-
stays at regional competition. and 
our unheralded men 's water polo 
team reached theDivisionl NCAA 
tournament this year. 

Though we usually beat up on 
small schools of one to five thou-
sand students, we have proven 
ourselves to be competitive with 
larger programs. 

What does this success mean? 
According to Bill Gannon.UCSD's 
Sports Infonnation Director, win-
ning in this dominant fashion 
greatly enhances the possibility of 
an eventual move to a higher divi-
sion. 

But winning is not the only 
element necessary to generate the 
fervor we need for Ihe move up, 
which brings me to another point. 

Money. 
The funds required for a suc-

cessful Division I athletic program 
would be at least 20 times more 
than what we havenow. Stanford's 
budget for its athletic program, 
which I consider a successful one, 
is somewhere in the neighborhood 
of 20 million dollars per year. 

Athletic Director Judith Sweet 
infonned me that UCSD 's budget 
has increased almost tenfold (from 
$90,000 to $800,(00) since she 
began working here fifteen years 
ago. 

Yet, this figure is a mere pit-
tance even for a Di vision ill school. 
Gannon estimates that our athletes 
operate under a budget that puts us 
in the bottom 20 percent of all Di-
vision ill programs. 

O ne needs to question where 
the money for scholarships would

significant contributions in 1990. 

This new infusion of talent will 
primarily be visible in the outfield. 
First-year players Melissa Mazanet 
and Cindi Murphy possess strong 
defensive abilities, and will most 
likely see a majority of time in left 
and right field, respectively. 

Sophomore Lisa Mora, who 
shifts to center after starting in left 
all last season, is the sole returnee 
in the starting outfield. Coats is 
depending on Mora 's aggressive-
ness to lead the outfield. 

Offensively, Coats intends to 
employ a "Billy Martin" type of at-
tack. This includes bunts and slaps 
by all members of the team, espe-
cially from the left side of the plate. 

Placing pressure on opposing 
defenses will be the ultimate objec-
tive, as Coats plans to utilize the 
squad's speed by attempting steals 
and by making things happen on the 
basepaths. 

The Tritons promise to be an 
aggressive, hard-nosed team in 1990. 
How far they go, however, will proba-
bly depend on the development of 
the new talent combined with the 
veteran nucleus.

Men's Tennis Shot Tritons on TV: 
What's Keeping 
UCSD Athletics 
From Moving to 
Divison I? 

What a surprise it was! 
Last Tuesday night , while whip-

ping through the channel , I hap-
pened upon UCSD's men's vol-
leyball team playing San Diego 
State on cable's Prime Ticker. 

"Unbelievable! " 1 thought out 
loud. 

Yes, it was true, I wasn' t imag-
ining it. Our Tritons were actually 
gracing the air wave. 

My mind raced to calculate the 

MATIHEW ROCHIOS 
implications of the whole thing. 
Mo t of California and pans of 
Arizona were receiving this broad-
cast. UCSD might even be getting 
some badly needed revenue for the 
athletic department. 

There, right there in the stands, 
were people I recognized. "Unbe-
lievable!" , had to say it again. 

, couldn't help myself, , was 
overcome by the urge to giggle. 
Then, an even stronger feeling 
came over me - one of pride. 

I was proud that UCSD was 
being looked at, promoted, even 
admired on blue screens around 
the southwesr. ' honestly felt proud 
aboutthis chool. A notion that has I 
rarely, if ever. entered my mind. 

But seeing them on TV also left 
me feeling unsatisfied - in the I 
sense that now, I want more Triton 
games covered by the networks. r 
want big-time athletics on our 
campus. 

, want our school to compete on 
the Division 'level. 

This isn ' t an unreasonable re-
quest, is i t1 I know that this is not 
the first time readers have heard 
this cry. 

Sincelhelate 1960's, there have 
been several articles on the topic of 
UCSD and big-time intercollegiate 
athletics. Obviously, the literary 
call has not been effective in the 
pasr. 

Nevertheless, I think it is time 
to assess what stands in the way of 
this university becoming competi-
tiveon the Division I athletic level. 

First, we must understand that 
this school is only 30 years old. 
Realizing this, we must further 
understand that - from its begin-
nings - UCSD has maintained a 
Division ill philosophy. 

This philosophy emphasizes 
broad participation in athletics by 
the students. It's a philosophy that 
doesn't prioritize spons and ed u-
cation, but see both as working to-
gether to benefit the student body. 
This philosophy does not include 
ath letic scholarships. 

However, as UCSD has grown, 
so has its success on the Division 
1IJ level. Five NCAA champion-
ship for women's volleyball, three

Down By Air Force 
By DANA CHAIKEN 
Associate Sports Editor 

It may have rained enough to 
postpone the UCSD men's tennis 
match against Air Force on Sun-
day, but the real storm hit yeste r-
day as the Falcons returned and 
bombed the Tritons 6-3. 

UCSD, which had opened the 
season 0-3, but bounced back with 
two victories last weekend, 10 t it 
shot at an even .500 record. 

Air Force, a Division J team 
that beat the Tritons badly last 
eason, swept the three doubles 

matche en route to victory. 
All but one of the si ngles con-

tests were decided in straight sets, 
as the match was tied 3-3 heading 
into doubles play. 

UCSD's Francoi Monnarcap-
tured a 6-3,7-6 victory in number 
one singles. 

Triton Chris Belloli , filling in 
formjuredSig Huber atthe econd 
singles spot, also won in straight 

sets, 6-3, 6-4. 
Tim Ditzler recorded the Tri-

tons' other ingles round win, 7-6, 
6-2, in the number five slot. 

Only Mike Rimala's number 
four match proved a battle, as he 
won the first set 6-4, but lost the 
final two 6-3, 6-1. 

The doubles round proved to be 
the Tritons ' downfall in their bid 
for a third consecutive victory, as 
o nly the number one match went 
the full three sets. 

Monnar and Ditzler fell 7-6, 2-
6, 6-3 to Tony Kravitz and Dan 
Oosterhou , the Falcons' number 
one and four singles players, re-
spectively.

Softball Attempts to Better Best Season Ever 
Tritons return eight players in shot at third consecutive regional appearance 

By JOHN ASUNCION 
Staff Writer 

Last season the UCSD softball 
team posted its best season ever-
finishing with a school record 35 
victories and achieving the highest 
rankings in the program 's history. 

Despite closing out the regular 
season 34-7, ranked atop the West 
Region and second in the nalion, 
the Tritons were unable to advance 
past the NCAA Regionals for the 
second year in a row. 

Even with the addition of nine 
first-yearplayers,two new coaches, 
and numerous early-season inju-
ries, this year's group of 17 intends 
to improve on that fin ish in 1990. 

This may be an execeptionally 
difficult task , as last year 's team 
may have been the most talented 
ever, personel-wise, even though 
it was unsuccessful on its mission 
to capture the national title. 

But, with the loss of only three 
players (two staners) from last 
year's squad, new Head Coach Sal 
Coats inheri ts a core of veterans 
that , coupled with the host of new-
comers , is capable of exceeding 
last season's record success. 

"Our team goals thi season 
include repeating to regionals, 
winning regionals, and advancing 
to nationals," Coats said. " If we 
can stay united as a team, these 
things are po sible." 

A primary key to succes will 
be the pitching staff. The Triton 
boast a number of strong pitchers 
- possibly the best slaffin the Di-
vision m West Region - and will 
stan the season with a three-per-
son rotation. 

Juniors Kathy Fogg and Lynn 

Moreno, the latter of whom was 
honored as an All-West Region 
utility player after transferring last 
season from Division I Texas-Ar-
lington, comprise two-thirds of the 
rotation. 

Fogg, a junior college transfer 
last season, posted a 9-3 record, 
while Moreno chalked up a 4-1 
mark in limited mound action. Both 
suffered knee injuries at one point. 

First-yearplayer Kim Stutzman 

from Northern California 's Beni-
cia High School gets the nod as the 
third starter. 

Sophomore Diarma Moreno, the 
program's first All-American, 

Pin. \ II- \\ 
pitched to a 13-4 record against 
mostly Division II competition last 
year. She is, however, recovering 
from off-season shoulder surgery 
in herthrowing arm. Coats expects

Special Delivery - Junior Kathy Fogg, who went 9-3 last 
season, returns to lead a strong rotation of four Triton pitchers. 

the younger Moreno, who was also 
voted the team's most valuable 
player last season, to return to the 
line-up during the course of the 
season. 

Primary catching duties belong 
to senior Tracey Kehr, who also 
puts in time as an outfielder. Last 
year's team captain and an All-
West Region honoree, Kehr rang 
up a .323 average with a late-sea-
son surge. Her aggressiveness and 
ability to run the team on defense 
will be an impo!1ant factor for 
success this season, according to 
Coats. 

Anotherstrength for UCSD will 
be the infield, which is solidified 
by two juniors who have started all 
the games over the last two sea-
sons. At sho!1stop will be Dana 
Chaiken, who posted a team-high 
.366 average in the lead-off pot, 
and led the team in several offen-
sive categories including stolen 
bases with 29. 

Starting at first base will be 
Pam Harnack, an outstanding de-
fensi ve player who committed only 
three errors last year. She has been 
voted the team's most valuable 
defensive player in both her sea-
sons as a Triton. 

The situation at second base has 
yet to be decided for opening day. 
StephanieMolina, who moved over 
from third base, figures to be one 
of the top contender for the job, 
according to Coats. 

The hot comer chores at third 
base will probably be inherited by 
first-year players Kris Melican and 
Michelle Leschhom. Both are part 
of a large group of talented new-
comers that will be counted on for

Blow Pong: Boot Factor 4 
Blow Pong is the only beer g--..me that should be considered 

for Olympic competition. few games are as well-suited for 
settling heated rivalries: frat against frat. boys against girls. 
communists against capitalists. 

The object of Blow Pong is to blow a Ping-Pong ball off the 
side of a table guarded by another team, thus forcing them to 
drink. 

The first step in Blow Pong is to prepare the equipment. 
Preferably, you should remove thenetona Ping-Pong table and 
tape the table's seam in order to proVide a uniform rolling 
surface. Otherwise, use any fairly large table. Next, get a supply 
of Ping-Pong balls, and choose two teams. Each team claims a 
long and short end of the table to defend and kneels down 
around It accordingly. The ball is then dropped from a few 
inches above the center of the table. and blowing ensues. The 
team which blows the ball off its opponents' side scoreS a point. 
The scored-upon team must drink a specified amount. A single 
game is played to 21. and a match is the best of 3 (or 5).

Dresher' 5 POlNer Failure 
Succeeds Minimalistically 

The Feb. 16 and 17 perform-
ances of the "rock" opera Power 
Failure at the Spreckles Theatre 
allowed the Paul Dresher Ensemble 
to express its own form of minimal-
ism while conveying an intricate 
set of contemporary themes . 
Dresher him elf calls Power Failure 
a "morality tale." 

A the opening scene of the first 
act is slowly revealed. three of the 
four characters become visible; 
covered in plastic, they sit com-
pletely still, forming the three points 
of a tnangle. Enter the fourth-a 
tall, imposing figure clad in trench-
coat and hat, wielding a flashligh. 
He is a security guard. 

He speaks the first words of the 
opera: "Why do people put plastic 
covers on their furniture?" 

The question is comical and ab-
surd, but its answer carries strong 
overtones: the covering is an at-
tempt to preserve. 

In a mixture of speakihg and 
singing, the guard continues his 
oration: "The pyramids buried the 
Egyptians who wanted to take their 
furniture with them." 

By Mark Bubien 
Staff Writer 

Here, the guard reveals a key 
to one of the opera's many inter-
twined themes with the ancient 
Egyptian imagery permeating the 
work. The Egyptians are known 
for their skill at mUlll.lnification-
the attempt to preserve the body 
throughout eternity, an attempt 
at immortality. 

"Why do people 
put plastic 
covers on their 
furniture?" 

The security guard, Merle 
Townsend, is played by Iibrerri t 
Rinde Eckert. Eckert co-wrote 
Power Failure with composer Paul 
Dresher, a UCSD alumnus. 

Within the story, Delta 
Chemical CEO Charles Smith-
son (John Duykers) receives no-
tice from his chief scientist, Ruth 
Lehman (Stephanie Friedman). 
that a virus which cures all dis-
eases has been developed in the 

labs. 
Smithson and his biographer, 

Judith Niles (Thomasa Eckert), 
accompanied by Townsend, de-
scend into the depths of the Delta 
Chemical building, burying them-
selves in the bowels of a modem 
pyramid. Once the four are united, 
a mysterious power outage traps 
them within the lab. 

The performers are supported 
by four musicians: Dresher on bass, 
keyboard. and digital effects; 
Miguel Frasconi, also on keyboard; 
Gene Reffkin on percussion; and 
Ned Rothenberg on woodwinds. 
The instrumentation seems ex-
tremely bare-but this is, after all, 
minimalism. 

And it is nor just instrumenta-
tion that is minimized. Melodic 
forms are reduced to their most 
basic rhythms. structured by key-
boards with percussion accompa-
niment and transitions marked by 
the woodwinds. 

Though slated as "rock opera," 
the musical style falls short of the 
rock tradition. The sound carries a

structure is too limited to approach

influence (the building block of 
rock and roll) is audible. 

Dresher denies that his work is

industrialist: materialistic, selfish,

from a soap-box (a truncated pyra-
mid), he reveals his intent to keep 
the virus for his own ends. 

Niles dreams of her job as a 
biographer, and of her Ill1fulfilled 
aspirations to becrnne a famous

Townsend, whose daughter was 
killed by Smithson's corrupt prac-
tie<'S, reveals his desire to destroy 
Smithson. 

Lehman's dream is an unex-
pected torment, contrasting pure 
science with pure religion. She is 
tom between religiOUS idealism and 
scientific development. Yet, she is 
also caught in greed; the virus is 
"my creation," she says, trying to 
lay her claim. 

For each character, there is an 
aspect of selfishness, an attempt 
for some aspect of worldly stature, 
be it money. power, or fame. 

scene. Dresher is able to establish 
an emotional context while allow-
ing the audience to remain atten-
tive to vocalizations. This is con-
sistent with his intent: "It is im-
portant that the audience follows 
the story," Dresher said. 

Throughout the dream se-
quences, the performers move 
around a control panel where the 
miracle virus resides. Strewn across 
the panel's front is an intricate 
design of hieroglyphics. Here, the 
virus is associated directly with 
Egypt. The virus is not just a pana-
cea; it is immortality.

After the power outage, 
Townsend comforts the others and 
lulls them to sleep. While they 
sleep, he is able to probe into their 
dreams, revealing different aspects 
of each person. 

Smithson is the stereotypical 

The desires of each character, 
and the symbolic importance of 
the virus, is expressed most effec-
tively through the scientist. And, 
a primary aspect of Ruth Lehman's 
persona is her name. 

The archetypal character Ruth 
was a biblical judge ("Ruth, Chap-
ter 2," cries Townsend), suggest-
ing moral judgement.

Deeming her "Lehman" links 
her with the common or lay man . 
This aspect of her name calls to 
mind the medieval morality play 
Everyman. 

Everyman is assisted through 
life by his resources (intelligence, 
knowledge, strength) but, when 
finally confronted with death, he 
realizes that he can take nothing 
with him but his good deeds.

UCSD Cabsret 

Theater in the Rough 
By Pierre de Gaillande 

Guardian Reporter 

At a school where weekend 
entertainment seems to be non-
existent, it is time that people take 
notice of the UCSD Cabaret. An 
experimental theater, music, and 
performance art club that puts on 
free weekend shows, the Cabaret 
allows undergraduate as well as 
graduate and non-student actors, 
writers, and directors to showcase 
their talent. 

Priding itself on its experimen-
tal nature and lack of thematic 
rcqwrements, it is precisely the 
raw, low·l,udget feeling that gives 
the Cabaret Il<>energy and unpre-
dictability. 

The club 's artistic director, 
Mary Coleman, a visual arts gr.,du-
ate student, explained that the 
Cabaret does not limit itself to one 
specific medium of performance. 
"It starred out more musically ori-
ented several years ago", accord-
ing to Coleman. However, as 
people in the last few years realized 
that it is "a great forum in which to 
try anything, a reaHy wide range of 
things have been done." 

For example, there have been 
improv nights when "the audience 

comes and shouts out suggestions, 
and the actors and actresses pick it 
up and make a play out of it," 
Coleman explained. 

Or, in the same vein, pieces of 
paper are passed out to audience 
members, who "write down adjec-
tives and nouns. almost like Mad 
Libs, and the performers have to 
put together a play from that." 

In other words, all you can 
expect from the Cabaret is the 
unexpected. 

Because of the Cabaret's inde-
pendence from the UCSD theater 
department, it has complete free-
dom to express itself in whatever 
manner it chooses. Most Cabaret 
performances so far has had ele-
ments of gaudy and shocking un-
exp.>ctedness, sometimes to the 
point ot', .. unchiness. 

In a rectnt production of 
"Women Behind "S:u:s," themes 
like lesbianism and SUIcide were 
addressed with such no-holds-
barred immodesty that the audi-
ence, when it was done, felt both a 
bit disturbed and strangely uplifted. 

The only limitations for the 
Cabaret are time and space. The 

shows cannot be more than an 
hour long to allow a break for the 
actors between the 9:00 p.m. and 
11 :00 p.m: shows, and the set must 
be simple and easy to set up. 

Co le man emphasized that 
shows must be "very flexible" be-
cause the set has to be taken down 
for classes on Saturday and recon-
structed for the shows that nigh t. 
"It's a very open-form thing," she 
said. "We're not trying to put on 
full-scale , high-tech productions." 

Along the lines of this free-
form idea, the Cabaret put on a 
performance art night during the 
weekend oOan. 26 and 27, titled 
"The Captain Vince Experience 
Carnival." 

Among the highlights of the 
night of what could be called "do-
it-yourself art" were a cake walk, a 
fortune teller, a living nude statue 
model posing to be painted, and a 
bilingual performance with acous-
tic guitar of an original composi-
tion titled "Sensitive Guy." 

Coleman, in addition to organ-
izing shows for Winter Quarter, 
also directed "Pink Toilet," which 
appeared the weekend of Feb. 9 
and 10. 

Written by UCSD graduate 
student Karen Ulrich, the surreal-
istic piece about dominance, the 
struggle for freedom, and house-
cleaning was at the same time 
deeply disturbing. thought provok-
ing' and emotionally draining. 

The drama of a spiritually en-
slaved 16-year-old housecleaner 
and her semi-deranged employer! 
mistress tookplaceemirelyaround 
a single, shiny toilet. Because., as 

Coleman explained, the Cabaret 
is rather scamily funded by the 
A.S, the cast and crew of "Pink 
Toilet" al\ chipped in to buy this 
very necessary prop. 

Once again, the acting here 
was brilliant and feverishly intense, 
and its interpretation was the topic 
of many conversations and debates 
between those who had seen it. 

Cabaret is virtually booked up 
forthe rest of the quarter, with the 
exception of one yet-to-be-an-
nounced improvisation night. 

Upcoming productions include 
"Tango Palace," written by New 
York playwright Irene Fornes and 

directed by UCSD graduate stu-
dent Lisa Portes, from Feb. 22-23. 

"Womyn's Herstory," a play by 
critically-acclaimed undergraduate 
Josephina Lopez, will appear March 
16-17. Performances are at 9:00 
p.m. and 11:00 p.m. at Revelle's 
409 small theater. 

Cabaret is open to new ideas, 
and Coleman encourages people 
to inquire at the theater depart-
ment about proposal applications 
for next quarter. 

Whether you want to perform 
or just enjoy a free show by UCSD 
students, the Cabaret is the place 
to be.

Grammys Receive High 'Raitt' ... ings 
LOS ANGELES-Last night at 
the Shrine Auditorium an abun-
dance of sequins, leather, hairspray, 
sunglasses, spike heels, tuxedo , 
and attitudes made their annual 
appearance at the Nationa I Acad-
emy of Recording Arts & Sci-
ences' 32nd Grammy Awards. 

Host Garry Shand ling wan :ed 
up the audience wi th his wry. witty 
observations about the rise in the 
median age of rockers receiving 
awards. 

Veteran rocker Bonnie Raitt 
swept all four of her nominated 
categories: Best Album, Best Pop 
Female Vocal, Best Rock Female 
Vocal, and Best Traditional Blues 
Recording (with John Lee 
Hooker). 

"For those of you who're keep-
ing track, the current score is 
Bonnie Raitt-4, Denver Broncos-
0," Shand ling quipped. 

An energetic and flustered 
Raitt exclaimed backstage, "I'm so 
overwhelmed and honored. To be 
able to get away with doing this 
[recording music) for twenty years, 
with or without a hit record-that 
is true success to me."

were not present at the ceremo-
nies. 

McCartney further squelched 
hopeful rumors of a Bearles reun-
ion, explaining, "We could never 
regroup without John." 

Other seasoned performers re-
ceiving accolades were Don Hen, 
ley (Record of the Year and Best 

Rock Male Vocal), Peter Gabriel 
(Best New Age Performance) , 
Stevie Ray Vaughn (Best Con-

The ageless wonder Dick Clark 
also received the Life time 
Achievement Award for his con-
tribu tions to the popu lar music 
world. 

After receivinghis award, Clark 
spoke to the press about the re-
cording industry's controversial 
censorship/labeling policies. 

"Parents should censor their 
kids themselves," Clark said. "The 
government shouldn't have to do 
it for them." 

Record stickering was not the 
only political issue broughtto light 
last night. 

Members of the Guardian An-
gels picketed outside, protesting 
the nominations of Guns 'N' 
Roses and Public Enemy. Both 
bands have recently received at-

te~tion for alleged racist lyrics and 
remarks. 

"I don't think we should reward 
these people for what they've done. 
It's giving them notoriety ," Guard-
ian Angels Regional Coordinator 
Paul Barrera said. 

While the Guardian Angels 
claimed that the NARAS may 
have neglected its social responsi-
bility, others felt that the academy

had made strides in the right di-
rection. 

Rapper Young M.C., who won 
Best Rap Performance , com-
mented tllat rap artists were treated 
better this year. 

However, he continued, "We 
have to crawl before we walk. 
We've still got a long way to go." 

Legendary rocker Lou Reed 
added his opinion on the new 
musicians that are emerging onto 
the rock scene. 

"I don't like the bigotry of some 
of the younger bands,but people 
should be able to express them-
selves," Reed commented. 

Still more advances from the 
academy included the separation 
of Heavy Metal and Hard Rock 
into twodifferentcategories. Met, 
allica took the Best Heavy Metal 
Performance honors. Observers 
expressed surprise when Guns 'N' 
Roses did not receive the expected 
Hard Rock award. Instead, 
newcomers Living Colour took 
the category. 

Best New Artist, Milli Vanilli, 
explained theirphilosophyofstar-
dom: "We knew that we had to 
change something if we wanted to 
be pop stars. So we changed our 
hair." 

Although the Indigo Girls 
failed to garner the Best New Art-
ist award, they received acclaim 
with the Best Contemporary Folk 
Recording. 

"Our main concern is to be-
come better songwriters," Indigo 
Girl Amy Ray commented after-
wards. "We don't have any formu-
lated plans for the future-we just

Last night's ceremony was an-
other predictable Grammy show-
case, with largely expected safe 
and sound winners walking away 
with many of the awards. 

One obvious exception to this 
rule, Bonnie Raitt, summed up the 
evening perfectly: "I can only take
