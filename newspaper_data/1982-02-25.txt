Glen and Shearer 
Editor: 

It seems that todays college 
tudents believe that there i 

an 11th commandment which 
states, " Thou shall be a college 
graduate." I believe that we 
mu t earn the right to be 
educated. College students 
today have this malformed 
idea that they are some special 
brand of people whom society 
must support. 

an easy thing to do, i.e., sell 
your car, stereo (and 
accompanying record collec· 
tion), tamp collection, etc. 

Personally, working and 
going to school at the same 
time has enhanced my tayat 
UCSD, I have improved my 
GPA. I budget my time much 
better, so I have found I 
actually do more now. My job 
pays well, therefore my 
standard of living is quite 
comfortable. I have to admit 
my work relates to my tudies 
(which is certainly a bonus), 
but I would be working 
anyway. 

Selective Service registration 

I am referring to a letter to 
the Editor (UCSD Guardian, 
Feb. 18) written by a "bio· 
engineering student" who is 
trying to get through chool. 
He complained about Reagan 's 
trimming of financial aid; he 
a ked, "What is a UCSD 
student going to do?" My 
an. wer: get a job! 

I am not commenting on 
Reagan' , budget cuts, What I 
am saying is that anyone can 
put himself through college. It 
really isn't hard . A typical 
budget for a 9 month academic 
year is $5 ,500 . Earning 
$4.60/ hour (the cafeteria pay 
$4.94) at 20 hours/week 
equates to $3,312 for 9 month . 
Working in the summer, one 
can easily earn $1,500. Finally, 
your parents should be able to 
afford the $700 balance. 

If the idea of working and go-
ing to school at the same time 
doesn't appeal to you, here are 
some other suggestion. Why 
don 't you try working and not 
going to school? On the other 
side, you could go to the local 
college near your home and 
li ve with your parent s. 
Liquidating assets is always 

I used to be on financial aid 
and I found that it was one big 
hass le: waiting in lines, filling 
out forms, getting forms 
signed (by everyone from your 
mother to your fir ·t grade 
teacher), etc. After a year of 
trou ble , I decided to 
completely di savow myself 
from student financial aid, 

I had signed up for aid this 
year and decided to cancel it, so 
I went down to the financial 
aid office. I explained to the 
counselor that I was going to 
earn too much money and I 
didn't want to accept any more 
aid . Her reply was, "Why don't 
you apply for a budget 
extension to increase your 
allowable earnings?" Another 
hassle, [ thought (I had gone 
through that process before), 
so I said that I didn't want to. 
She then asked me, "Why 
don't you stop working?" I told 
her that [ enjoyed working and

The Bottom Line 

When Thomas K Turnage 
had to tell his 25·year·old son 
last year that he needn't 
register for a possible draft, 
the Selective Service System 
director must have seen the 
writing on the wall. 

"I know a general officer 
with three sons, of whom two 
had registered," Maj. Gen. 
Turnage recalled last Tuesday 
in an interview. "He found out 
over the (Christmas) holidays 
that the other hadn't. (The 
third on) is registered now." 

For Turnage, however, 
convincing a many as 1 
million other young non· 
registrants to follow uit is an 
immediate and much bigger 
problem. He's not ure how 
many of those nameless young 
recalcitrant will have signed 
up when President Reagan's 
even·week "grace period" 

ends Sunday, Feb. 28. but he 
is, if anything, optimistic. 

" I 'm excited about the 
response to the grace period, 
said Turnage, who wouldn't 
offer specific numbers . " All I 
can say is that the last two 
inputs (from post offices) are 
the best two we've had since 
registration was rei nstitu · 
ted. " 

If Turnage is right, that's 
good news for the administra· 
tion. When President Reagan 
renewed draft registration 
Jan. 7, White House aides 

worried that his break from a 
campaign pledge would only 
further undermine popularity 
of a peacetime sign·up. Indeed, 
the President's characteriza· 
tion, then, of the world as "a 
dangerous place" didn't 
negate the fact that merely 75 
percent of males born in 1963 
had registered at post office 
windows last year. 

But Turnage, a 59·year·old 
veteran of World War II and 
Korea, has had no choice but to 
be optimistic. As conciliatory 
as the "grace period" seemed, 
the gesture wa the only card 
the administration could play. 
Should the general clemency 
fail to yield anything Ie s than 
90 percent of outstanding non· 
registrants, an overvv'helmed 
Ju tice Department will 
probably throw up its hands. 
What does the US attorney 
general do with 100,000 non· 
registrants? 

Turnage's task is to worry 
less about no·shows than 
future registrants. "We just 
don't see this 'registration 
resistance' that a lot of people 
think exists," he said. "Based 
on our perceptions, it's just a 
matter of getting the word 
out." The general, for the 
record, added that he hasn't 
decided whet her to track down 
non·registrants this spring 
with the help of government 
computer files. 

Yet, in his recent public 
relations efforts, Turnage has 
been hard pressed to hurdle all 
the obstacles that led, in part , 
to hi own son's confusion 
over registration require ' 
ments. As much as this 
military man takes pride in the 
"efficacy" of his agency's 
work, the last·minute 
publicity campaign has had to 
contend with inherent 
problems of execution and 
credibility. 

Seven weeks ago, the 
Selective Service Sy tern 
rushed into product ion four 
pu blic service announcements 
for television and radio. The 
10.,30- and 6O·second spot, 
some of which feature 
country·and·western singer 
Jerry Reed, have been q ueezed 
out of a Selective Service 
budget that doesn't afford 
pre s relea es. Given the 
targeting difficulties of the 
non· registrant "market," the 
effectiveness of this campaign 
may never be determined , 

Much of the grace period's 
success, Turnage admits, will 
have relied on the good will of 
the news media. Invokingcivic 
responsibility, his agency has 
counted heavily on contacts 
with commercial and college 
out let , The affable general 
believes few editor will shirk 
their duty.

Choice is an issue for everyone today 
By BARBARA GALLIOS 

One of the mo~t cogent rea ons for encouraging 
women to enter the work force and to seek career 
training is simply because our input is a valuable 
resource that has heretofore been overlooked or 
repressed . The full participation of women working 
at the peak of their abilities would bring an influx of 
talent and skill into a society that sorely seems to 
need it. Women have not shunned their 
responsibility to society, but have had to demand, 
piece by piece, their right to participate. Their right 
to vote, to hold a job, to earn a salary, to raise a 
family in the most responsible manner, requires 
that women be free of oppressive forces that prohibit 
their participation . 

Oppre sion may be dire t as when the laws used 
to say wh never a woman conceives she must bear a 
child. or it may be insidious a when an employer 
refu es to hire a woman because she has the 
capacity to conceive. Unl ss a woman has control 
over her life, sh will perceived as one who can not 
participate in a responSIble manner, even if he has 
the capability to do so, The right to a safe and legal 
abortion is a sial recognition that a woman has th 
ultimate control over her own body. 

At UCSD if you choo. c to terminate a pregnancy, 
you may find yourself in a financial bind. The health 
insurance offered through the university is willing 
to pay your bills if you choose to continue the 
pregnancy to full·term, but will not pay for the 
cheaper and safer alternative, an elective abortion. 
There was a fund dispersed through the Student 
Health Center whereby you could obtain the means 
for your abortion, but this fund may soon be cut. 

If you choose to bear the child you must pay. too, 
but in a more lasting manner, It is a struggle to raise 
a chi ld in a society that has not learned to cooperate 
with the parenting role, that does not offer flexible 
work hours, does not encourage maternity or 
·paternity leaves, and does not have adequate child 
care facilities, If true choice is to be established, then 
providing these service is equally important as the 
right to choose abortion, 

Recently there has been an anti·abortion bill 
propo!>ed in the US Senate, the Senate Joint 
Resolution 110 or a "human·life amendment." 
which r verts the ability to pass abortion restrictive 
laws back to the states. The result of such a policy 
has already n suffered by women in the US before 
the 1973 Roe v. Wade d ision , Before this decision, 

forty·six of the fitty states had anti·abortion laws. 
Forced motherhood is a serious violation of basic 

human rights. Many women died tryi ng to obtain 
illegal abortions or died at their own hands by self· 
induced abortions. Other women had chi ldren 
against their will which hindered their careers, 
made them dependent on men, and made the very act 
of sex a threatening phenomena . 

Women are not the reproductive in truments of 
the state. Only by asserting our right to choose can 
we retain our human dignity, our natural right to 
self ·determ inat ion ,

Pacific News Service The administration 
US should stay in the UN of draft registration 

By A. M. BABU 
Pacific News Service 

The rising chorus of 
demands for US withdrawal 
from the United Nations 
ignores one fundamental fact: 
The United States is 
inextricably enmeshed in the 
world, whether it likes it or 
not, and the UN is a reasonably 
accurate reflection of that 
world, For the same reasons 
that this country cannot 
withdraw from the real world, 
it would be senseless - even 
di a trous - to withdraw 
from the UN . 

Yet it i no wonder that US 
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpa · 
tri ck , whose voice is among 
those threatening withdrawal, 
find s her job frus trating. It is 
not an ea y task to accomodate 
one ' elf to a pos ition of 
shrinking influence, especially 
when this nation so recently 
dominated the world body. 

For two decades after World 
War II, the Third World was 
effecti\rely blocked from 
taking any significant action 
on world events through the 
UN. It either toed the Western 
line or retreated into isolation. 
India was the only major 
Third World country that 
challenged the We t on critical 
events that confronted the 
world community. China wa 
barred from the organization 
by the con istent US vetoes in 
the ecurity Council, as well 
a by an aggressive diplomacy 
of arm·twisting on Third 
World countries. 

The UN was used, in effect. 
as a Western instrument in 
the Cold War. 

It wasn't until the 1955 
Bandung conference in 
Indonesia that the new 
emerging countries came 
together with China and the 
Third World to review the 
world situation collectively. 
Hencefort h. the non·a ligned 
concept was transformed from 
a passive to a positive po ture. 

The non·aligned position on 
key major international issues 
became so assertive and 
independent at the United 
Nations that the lat e lohn 
Fos ter Dulles described it as 
"non ·aligned again s t the 
United States. " 

As the process of decoloni "a· 
tion gained momentum in the 
1960:;, every new country that 
joined the UN took the non· 
aligned position, leading to the 
greater eros ion of Western 
influence in the world body . 
Now, with the Third World 
dominant at the UN General 
Assembly, . the United tates 
finds it elf consistently on the 
defensive, just as the Soviet 
Union u ed to be, and forced to 
resort to the use of the veto at 
the Security Council. 

It is impossible to return to 
the good old day when the 
world followed meekly in the 
United State' foot tep . The 
United States is increas ingly 
moving in a direction tha t goes 
against the main currents of 
world events , The way to 
regain some of its influence at 

the UN, or at least credibility, 
is not to threaten to leave the 
organization, but to try and 
understand thi new direction 
in which the world is heading. 
For whether the UN survives 
or not, the importance and 
influence of the Third World 
will only continue to grow, 

In fact, the dilemma the 
United States faces at the UN 
is only the tip of the iceberg. 
The more fundamental crisis, 
of which the UN i only a 
reflection, is the worldwide 
challenge to the Western · 
imposed world order - a 
s ystem which is s tru cturally 
inca pable of resolving t he most 
vital chall enge fac mg t he 
world today, that of the Widen· 
109 gap between t he develop· 
ing and developed countries. 

In assess ing the nature of 
thiS challenge, the re IS no more 
useful barometer tha n the U~ 
General Assembl y. In It self. as 
a barometer, it is neither good 
nor evil. It only reflect s what IS 
going on in the real world . One 
of the major follies of the 
superpower has been to 
ass ume that , by controlling 
the barometer, they could 
influence world event . They 
cannol. The y c an only 
postpone them or give them a 
temporary twist. World events 
ultimately res pond to fact ors 
other than UN resolutions, 
such as bank rate , crop 
f ai lur es, int e rn at io n a l 
liquidity , commodit y pnces, 
et c.

"From what we've found, 33 

of 36 editorial coments 
(compiled from around the 
nation) were favorable," said 
Turnage. "I like those odds." 

From his perspective, 
however, Turnage only needs 
to win over a respectable share 
of the population. His chief 
re ponsibility is to keep the 
registration cards coming at 
levels that don ' t weaken US

United 
Nations 
<.:ontillll l' cI fn UIl Jla~c : ~ 

But the UN also is more than 
a baro meter. Apart from 
subjecting all nations to public 
a ccou n tabi lit y, it s mo re 
important fun ction is to 
provide an arena where world 
conflicts can be aired and 
brought out without reverting 
to armed conflict. The onl y 
ri sk for nations is some loss of 
national prestige_ We all 
remember how the com bined 
effort · of the United States 
and the Soviet Union at the UN 
helped prevent the 1956 Suez 
cri i from esca la ting, and 
forced Britain and France to 
\ ithdraw (rum their dj:,a:,' 

trous adventure. As long as it 
exists, the UN can and does 
provide a peaceful alternative 
to international confl agration. 

It would be a grave blow 
both to US interests and to 
world peace generally for a 
superpower like the United 

tates to withdraw from the 
UN. Only the mayor of ew 
York can afford to talk serious 
about uch a folly, for he has 
not hing to lose and votes to 
gai n. But t he United States 
has much to lose.

University of Ca li fornia 
President David S. Saxon 
reports that federal budget 
cuts and policy change 
relating to higher education 
have placed "an intolerable

meeting in San Francisco of 
February 19, that the cuts are 
expected to reduce student aid 
to UC students from $]30 
milhon received In 1981 to$30 
million in 1984, a cut of 75 
percent. "It will reduce or 
eliminate thousands of awards 
and fellowships, not only for 
mIddle income students but 
for low income and minority 
students as well," axon. aid. 

UC students WIll not be the

tressed . "Students in the 
high schools must decide on a 
timely ba i, whether the 
federal budget is ready or not, 
about where - and if - they 
are going to carry their 
education further. Similarly , 

tudent at the undergraduate

UC Vet benefits 
not rising enough 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
li8C'ramento Corre5pondent 

ACRAMENTO . During 
the past decade, University of 
California fees have increased 
nearly $400. At the ame time. 
GI benefit for veterans have 
not increased at all and 
inflation has continued at a 
steady pace . 

Several CaliforOla legisla· 
tor have Indicated the 
combinat ion of these three 
factors has made It increasing· 
Iy diffi cult for veterans, 
e pecially from the Vietnam 
era, to continue theIr 
education, which was 
di rupted by their military 
stint. 

That, according to Assem· 
bly member Tom Hannigan , 
(D·Fairfield). is the reason he 
introduced AB 2650, a bill 
which would roll back and 
freeze at theJanuary 1981 level 
the amount veteran under the 
GI bill mu t pay in UC fees. 

Vietnam veterans receIve 
about $3,100 each academic 
year in GI benefits, while UC 
fees have increased from $7 
in January 1981 to roughly 
$1,100 for t he 1982·&3 chaol 

year. 
Michael Lea\eck, staff 

consultant to the lew lature ' 
Joint Committee on Veteran: 
AffaIrs, 'aid ye terday the 
mcreased fees take a larget 
bite from nefit otherwi'e 
planned for food and hou mg. 

Leaveck aid the fee rollback 
and freeze is neces an' 
becau e the military "took 
four vear out of the live of 
people who could have made 
progress m the Job market .. 

The committee estimates 
about 1.100 veteran - one 
percent of the entire LTC 
enrollment state\\ ide - would 
be eligible for the rollback . The 
bill stipulate the_ tudent

The bill would cost the

Brown signs bills 
to speed funding 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacramento Corresponde nt 

SACRAMENTO - Governor 
Brown this week completed 
his budget balancing act by 
signing bills held over from 
last year's special session, 
speeding collection of sal es 
taxes, conforming the stat e to 
federal welfare laws and 
furt her cutt ing the budget . 

Ot her effor t by the 
gove rnor to co nform to 
California 's balanced budget 
law included speedu p in 
payroll t axes, higher tax 
interest penalties and budget 
reductions including a $70 
mill ion cut in University of 
California spending. 

Brown predicted Wednes-
day that, barring economic 
downturns in California, the 
state will end this fiscal year in 
June with a $100 mill ion 
sllrplus. Is the un iver ity, 
already riddled with budget 
reductions, breathing a sigh of 
relief? 

"Absolutely not," said UC 
budget specialist Jesse Shaw. 
"My guess is we could have 
another round of cuts." 

News Analysis 
Last month, after State 

Controller Ken Cory warned 
the state may have to i sue 
rubber checks to avoid a 
budget deficit, Brown told 
reporters if his tax speedups 
weren't approved, he might 
ask the Legislat ure to let him 
make additional across-the-
board reduction . 

Why, then , does Shaw fear 
more cutbacks despite the 
approval of Brown' s propos· 
al ? 

Becau se, he s aid . th e 
effectiven e s of reve nu e 

enhancements such as tax 
speedup depend upon a good 
eco no m ic pe rfo r mance. 
Although Brown maintains 
every economic forecast shows 
recovery this spring, the 
un iversity tends to agree with 
Repub lica n clai ms t hat 
eco nomic fore ca s t s are 
undependable. 

State Republican leaders 
chide Brown's revenue 
measure as tax increases in 
disguise. and have called for 
budget reduction to alleviate 
the $900 million shortfall 
accrued this year. 

If the economy fail , and 
Brow n heeds Repu bl ican 
advice to bring back the oft-
used budget axe, UC officials 
may have to rewrite it s 
spending plan. 

As for student , Shaw said , 
the university cannot rule out 
the possibi lity of yet another 
fee increase thi s academic 
year, perhaps a doubling oft he 
spring quarter surcharge to 
$50. 

"It' awfully late in the year 
to change the fees again ," 
Shaw said , adding "It 's not a 
reasonable thing to do. We 
don't like the alternative of 
increasing fee . The increa ed 
fee we've already done are not 
fair, but it's not very fair for 
the state to come along and cut 
our budget either." 

In this post-Propos it ion 13 
era , it i apparent the word 
"perennial" can best describe 
the state budget proce s. 
While further adju tments are 
currently feared for 1981 -82, 
the 1982-83 budget is waiting 
in the wings.

Social consciousness in 
the sciences and industry 

B Y RANDY USHIYAMA use IS not bad for the health of the user. 
The recent explosion in technica l knowledge 

ha caused many to wonder wh ther or not the 
public is sufficiently protected against the 
health and environmental hazards associat ed 
with such growth. While there exist certain 
federal and tate regulatory agencies organized 
to handle these areas, cutbacks by the fed eral 
gov ernment ma y oon redu ce t h eir 
enforcement effectiveness. As a result of the e 
curr e nt deve lopmen ts, co ns id erable 
respon!' ibility is now placed on industry and 
research organi zations to self· police their 
act ivites. 

The record of technology ex ploitation by 
major U.S. corporations is filled with case 
hi s tori es invo lving th e q ues ti ona bl e 
application of techonolgy. These practices vary 
from industry to industry, and usually short 
range profit is the primary motivating force. 
The seriou ne s of these actions varies from 
the improper disposal of bioagents to the 
indiscriminate distribution of antibiotics in 
th" underdeveloped countries . 

Some indus try spokesmen argue that these 
so-called hea lth hazards a re a natu ral 
byproduct of livi ng in a technological age; 
others question whether such hazards need 
exis t at all. The American automobile industry 
points to the cost of emiss ion controls as one of 
the reason for the pre ent inviability of the 
industry. Yet , Japane e car manufacturer 
seem to be able to incorporate these devices 
while retaining the perfomance capabilities 
neces ary for competitivene s in the world 
market. 

Indu try ha freq uentl y taken the position 
that a particular chemica l, product. or form of 
radiat ion is sa fe unt il proven da ngerous. For 
example, industrial limits of acceptable short 
term and long term radiation exposure depend 
upon the existence of a "threshold li mit" on 
radiat ion damage. Proponents of thi radiat ion 
"t hreshold" claim that below a certain 
" threshold" there is no long term damage to 
the human body. This argument has virtually 
no supporting evidence. Yet the lack of 
disproving evidence makes the argument a 
popular one for those advocating the raising of 
fede ral limits on rad iat ion exposure. Often, it is 
this type of uncertainty that makes it diff;cult 
to police violators of health and environmental 
standards. 

The danger of certai n products need not be 
an ambiguous quantity in order that 
production proceed. The tabacco industry is an 
interesting example. The evidence pointing 
towards the hazardous nature of cigarette 
smoking has been accumulating for the last 60 
years. Few people would contend that cigarette 

[n terestingl y. tobacco sales seem just as trong 
as ever, and the industry continues its slick 
advertis ing campaign aimed at the young 
con umer. Si nce the average smoker can 
consume an extremely large number of 
cigarett s in 30 years time, it is not surpri sing 
that the young adult market is highly coveted . 

The government has been very hypocritical 
on the issue of cigarette smoking. While much 
of the research supporti ng the contention that 
cigarettes are harm ful has been federall y 
funded , t he government continues to operate 
laboratories where the var ious strai ns of 
tobacco are manipulated to. produce greater 
viabi lity and yield . T his is e peciallyappalling 
when one considers the cos t in lost 
product ivi ty due to smoking related health 
problem . Here we have an example in which 
there seems to be no expressed social concern 
on the part of govern ment or ind ustry . We have 
one large organization feedi ng another as a 
part of a vicious cycle. [n Japan , cigarette 
moking is actually su bsidized by the 

government because the nicotine content of the 
cigarett e increases product ivi ty. 

T he previous example have been directed 
towards large industrial concerns. However, 
t he smaller and harder to police industrie po e 
an even greater potential danger to health and 
t he environment. This is becau. e their 
.. ocial" behavior is to a large extent dependent 
upon the social concern of the owner of the 
busine s in question . The small concerns have 
the large. t ca h flow problems, and are the 
least able to absorb the costs of the equipment 
necessary to protect the health of employees 
and the public . It i within thi framework that 
many fee l a potentially dangerous substance 
cou ld be unleashed . 

For example. one could easily visualize a 
sce nar io in which recombinant DNA 
technology becomes so prevalent that "mom 
and pop" bioi ndustries develop . Such 
en terprises would be likely candidates for the 
release of dangerou pathological species 
unless strict guidelines are enforced. 

Industry has been the main area of interest, 
but what about the potential danger arising 
from scientific research? What is the level of 
social concern in the lab? 

Research is generally an entirely different 
ball game compared to industrial product ion. 
In industry , it is very difficult to pinpoint the 
responsible party for a given hazard becau e of 
the largeness of many corporations. When one 
is at the production phase, the "potentia l 
hazard" has pa ed so many government te ts. 
committees, and reports that the responsibi lity

New analysis technique developed 
An innovative new tech-

nique for eparating and 
analyzing elements has been 
announced by researchers at 
Los Alamos National Labora-
tory. The method uses a 
traditional ma spectrometer 
and an off-the-shelf laser and 
has implications for energy. 
indu try, wa te treatment, 
and defense. 

Four scientists in t he 
Laboratory' s Chemistry -
Nuclear Chemistry Divison 
say they have successfully 
separated elements whose 
chemical behavior is so close 
as to be almo t identical. This 
technique can be u ed for 
analysis of materials, to detect 
impurities that might affect 
strength and integrity, for 
analysis of minute quantities 
of elements in nuclear and 
chemical waste, to produce 
ultra·high-purity material. 
and to va tly improve 
measurement techniques in 
defense programs involving 
nuclear weapons. 

Principal investigators are 
Alexander ]. Gancarz, Jr .. 
Charles M. Miller, Nicholas S. 
Nogar, and William R. Shield. 

Laboratory experiments 
have been conducted success-
fully on two elements that are 
notoriously hard to separate-
lutetium and ytterbium. 
Lutetium i often added to a 
nuclear weapon a a 
"detector," to help determine 
the weapon's performance. 
The problem is that lutetium 
and another element whose 
chemical behavior is almost 

identical, ytterbium, are 
naturlly occurring "ra:'e 
earth" elements found in soi l. 
After a weapon detonates in 
underground tests, the 
radioactive lutetium in 
amples collected from the 

debris can give a measurement 
of the weapon's energy yield 
and performance. However, 
ytterbium is also present in 
the sample, and its isotopes are 
identica l in mass to the 
radioactive lutetium isotopes 
and in addition, are millions of 
times more abundant. 

This complication means 
ytterbium interferes with 
mass analysis of lutetium and 
must be removed before the 
detector element can yield 
information about the nuclear 
device . Until now, the 
chemical separation of 
lutetium and ytterbium has 
been tediou , time-consuming, 
and complicated. 

"With this new technique, 
we can selectively separate 
lutetium from ytterbium right 
in the mas spectrometer and 
can greatly improve the speed 
and integrity of energy-yield 
measurements," Gancarz 
says. 

The techniq ue is capable of 
measuring minute amounts of 
radioactive elements in 
nuclear waste, which may 
greatly simplify monitoring 
compliance with federal 
requirements on disposal and 
storage. It also has the 
potential for characterizing 
elements present in chemical 
waste. The selectivity of the 

proces may allow industry to 
produce ultra-pure materials 
for applications where purity 
really counts, such as 
manufacture of si licon for 
semicondu ctors. Another 
potential industrial applica-
tion could be analysis of 
materials to precisely 
determine ratios of elements 
that are present. Often, 
s tructural integrity is 
dependen t on a correct ratio of 
various elements. 

Nick Nogar explains that 
mass spectrometry is a well-
known and successful way of 
separating and measuring the 
ratio of isotopes of various 
elements. The mas spectro-
meter is a machine used to 
KIt:nttiy and measure isotope . 
Samples are placed on a 
filament in the machine, 
heated to high temperature to 
produce charged (or ionized) 
particles which are then 
separated by mas in the 
machine's magnetic field. In 
thi technique, all element in 
the sample form charged 
particles. 

What Los Alamos has 
acmmplished is an innovative 
application of what is called 
"res onance ionization 
spectroscopy. " 

In the new technique, 
samples are heated gently . 
Low heat allows researchers to 
produce a cloud of atoms, 
rather than charged particles. 
When the atomic cloud is hit 
by a laser that is tuned to the 
characteristic wavelength of

Findings show ancestors ate meat 
New fo sil evidence from 

East Africa suggests an 
important role for meat in the 
diet of early human-like 
creatures. 

Providing perhaps the first 
solid evidence of food choices 
in primeval human life, the 
findings will affect the debate 
over the role of women versus 
men in shaping the evolution 
of the human diet. 

The new findings, dealing 
with distinctive cut marks on 
fossil animal bones, were 
reported last month at the 
annual meeting of the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science in 
Washington, D.C. by Glynn 
Isaac, professor of anthropo· 
logy at the University of 
California in Berkeley, Henry 
Bunn, a UC Berkeley graduate 
student and Richard Potts, a 
lecturer at Yale University. 

Isaac said "a situation of 
confusion and legitimate 
dou bt has arisen regarding the 
place of meat in the long-tenn 
histo'J of evolving human 
diets.' The classic picture, he 
said, gives male hunting a 
central role in shaping diet. 

In recent years, anthropo· 
logists such as Professor 
Nancy Tanner of UC Santa 
Cruz have argued that the 
gathering of edible vegetation 
by females was the most 
important factor in determin· 
ing the hominid diet. 

Isaac pointed out that 
neither theory was based on 
archaeological evidence but, 
instead, on s pec ulative 
thinking. The new findings do 
show that the meat of large 
animal such a elephant and 
hippos was being cut up and 
almo t certainly eaten by early 
human-like creatures. one-
and-a·half to two million years 
ago, he said. 

The bones bearing the cut 

marks were found in areas 
that may be campsites and 
also in isolated places where 
stones and stone tools are rare, 
suggesting that the cutting 
tools may have been carried to 
these sites and then taken 
away again, just as modern 
workers take their tools with 
them. 

"What we don't know," the 
UC Berkeley anthropologist 
said, "is whether the 
butchering of a carcass 
occurred once in a lifetime, 
once a year, once a month or 
once a week. From the present 
findings, we can't say how 
central this was in the life of 
these hominids, or under what 
social arrangements it was 
done. These questions are now 
under active study." 

The fo il bones bearing the 
cut marks come from the well-
known archaeological ites of 
Olduvai and Koobi Fora in 
East Africa's Rift Valley. The 
Koobi Fora studies are part of a 
research project undertaken 
jointly by UC Berkeley, 
Richard Leakey and the Kenya 
National Mu se um . The 
Olduvai excavations were 
directed by Mary Leakey. 

The actual bone studies 
were carried out by UC' Bunn 
and lecturer Potts of Yale. 
Although they used different 
methods - Potts studied his 
bone with an electron 
canning microscope, and 

Bunn relied on the unaided eye 
and conventional microscopes 
- both reached si milar 
conclusions. 

Bunn reported finding" a 
serie of very fine linear 
groove on bone surfaces." 
The e grooves, he said, are 
u ually distinguishable from 
carnivore tooth marks, rodent 
gnaw marks, grooves formed 
over time by pressu re from 
root and from grooves cau ed 

by abrasive sediments. 
Moreover, he said, the grooves 
found are indi tingui hable 
from known butchery marks 
on bones from more recent 
periods. 

The real importance of the 
new evidence, Isaac pointed 
out, is what it implies for the 
beginnings of social organiza-
tion. 

"Most of us who study early 
pre-history," he said, "are 
firmly convinced that fruits , 
nuts and perhaps tubers, dug 
up with simple tools, were the 
mainstay of life. The interest 
in confinning that meat, too, 
had become more important 
than it was for monkeys and 
apes is that this may have 
helped produce a situation in 
which collective social 
acquisition of food was more 
advantageous than the 
individuali tic feeding 
..:haracteristic of our primate 
relatives. 

"Collective acquisition of 
food may in turn have 
stimulated the development of 
language ability and of 
intricate social patterns." 

The work of Isaac and Bunn 
is supported in part by a grant 
from the National Science 
Foundation.

Men swamp Cal Baptist

Tue day evening, the men's 
basketball team buried a five 
game losing streak by sticking

It was the cu lmination of a 
1981·82 year which saw the 
Tritons drop from an original 
13 man roster to only eight 
players and manage to grind 
out a playoff berth with a 5-8 
league record. The night did 
not elapse without notice.

Wight brought the home fans 
to their feet with ] 7 minutes 
remaining by breaking the all -
time season coring record. 
The former mark, set by Brian 

Todd in the 1970-7l season, 
was 537 points. Wight 's 26 
points against Ca l Baptist

required to compete in eight 
out of the ten possible sports, 
(volleyball and tennis dou bles 
are excluded. for obvious 
reasons, from individual 
competition). Teams must 
have at lea t twenty entries, 
with no more than two team 

members for each sport. 
Team must also have no more 
than five people, at lea.,t one of 
whom must be a member of 
the opposite sex. 

In the past, individuals and 
teams have set some fairly tall 
record, but the RecreatIOn

"Thi means that it i

reponsibilities and, most of all, 
to provide guidance for our 
students as t hey try to plan for

"Let me assure you," Saxon

"Any essential sorting out of

would cut into the university's

the decrea ed revenue may 
have to be compensated by

"T hi s unique way of

on that group of element

ultraviolet light. Rare earths 
are the primary source of 
pigment used in such varied 
areas as fluorescent bulbs and 
color television tubes. The 
choice of elements for the 
current experiments was 
largely dictated by the

has been diffused over a large number of 
people. In research, however, much of the 
burden of responsibility lies with the 
individual researcher(s). This directed 
responsibility has the affect of raising the level 
of social concern over that of the production 
line. We note with great satisfaction the high 
marks that most labs get for compliance with 
voluntary NIH guideline for recombinant 
DNA work. 

Unfortunately, errors in judgement or other 
human failings can mitigate this overall higher 
level of ocial con ciousne . At the bottom of 
the scale. we have the rare elfish and 
thoughtless researcher who conducts 
experiments without proper authorization and 
without regard for the potential dangers to 
fellow workers and the public as a whole. 

While the researcher is indeed responsible 
for the safety of those involved in the actual 
experimental procedure, in addition, the 
researcher has a certain degree of 

responsibility for all future outcomes and 
applications arising from his iesearch. Often. 
the future ramification of a scientific project 
are hard to predict and one would not expect 
social respon ibility to be an issue. At other 
times, the implication are quite clear. For 
example, those that have worked towards the 
creation of nuclear weapons must also accept 
ome of the responsibility for their use. Recent 

government altempts to suppress reserach 
information for national security reasons 
demonstrate the high degree of responsibility 
involved here. 

We have made certain connection between 
the researcher and industry, and we have 
delegated a certain degree of re ponsibility in 
each case. Whether or not we ,meet the 
challenge of this re pon 'ibility remains to be 
seen but the future depend s upon it . One easily 
sees t~e path from the laboratory to the 
production line, but it is an entirely different 
matter when one appreciates the responsiblity 
involved.

Visiting lecturer, Gina 

Val de's' ThereAre No Madmen 
Here is a book composed of 
three short tories and a novel 
that together recreate the 
Mexican-Chicano urban 
experience in the US from an 
unprecedented feminist-
Chicana per pective. 

The central charact er, and 
one of the greater strengths of 
this book, is Maria' Portillo. A 
resourceful Mexican woman, 
who for economic rea ons 
leave Mexico with her three 
daughters . Portillo not only 
continues truggling in the US 
but also determinedly seeks 
alternatives to their oppres-
sive existence 

Though independent. 
Portillo is also a unifying force 
for her large family . Once 
sett led in Los Angeles. she 
soon becomes the light to 
which a com munit y of 
M ex ican and Chicano 
relatives are drawn. The many 
brothers, uncles, aunts and 
cousin that make up the 
Portillo family encompass 
three generation of Mexican-
Chicanos. creating a tension 
between traditional and 
progressive lifestyles.

Gina Valdes' new novel i a 
compelling story on the life 
and times of a Chicano famil y. 

pleasurable to read that it 
seem horter than its 151 
pages. 

Though there is a strong 
and direct depiction of 
oppres ion, there is a thread of 
humor interwoven throughout 
the whole work with both 

element balancing one 
another. This book i s 
significant aesthetically ' ince 
the simple use of language is 
strengt hened by the lyrical 
quality of the writing and by 
the subtle u e of Aztec 
symbo ls . It is important 
historically as one of the few 
novels written by a Chicana, 
and socially as a moving, 
authentic depiction of the 
second largest group of peopl 
living in California.

Atotnicafe deiiver another 
interesting perfortllance 

T uesday nigh t's show is a rollercoaster of emotions 
BY GFREGORY CHAPELLE 

Tuesday night 's Atomicafe 
concert did it to me again. 
While giving food for thought 
on its different kind of format, 
it also became, as the program 
described, "a confrontation 
with the listener's psycho-
acoustical threshold." Quite 
frankly , my thre hold was not 
only confronted , but overpow· 
ered into submission . 

The piece that sums up mos t 
of my' fru trations is I.M. 
Ta kum ei no's " Pi ece for 
Audience and Locomotive." It 
con i ted enti rely of slips of 
paper bei ng passed out to the 
audience w hich humorous ly 
described an imaginary train 
travelling aero s the stage. 

Whle rather funny, it left 
the audience and myself with a 
"what' s going on?' attitude 
that kept us glu ed to ou r seat s 
duri n g th e i n te rmi ssion 
imm ed iate l y a ft e r war d , 
apparent ly afraid that the 
interm is ion too wa not really 
happening! 

In fact , the entire program 
be for e t he intermi s ion 
seemed to be absurdl y leadin,g 

the audience toward the 
macabre. The introductory 
piece "Man Ought to Sit 
Quiet" by Bob Willey was one 
of the few sane pieces that [ 
could grasp with any sureness, 
but it brevity seemed almost 
to reflect the audience's 
disinterest with it so near the 
beginning of the concert. 

Steven Knopoff's "Exempl· 
ar and Variations for Clarinet "

fol lowed , with it Gustav 
Mah ler·like approach to the 
mu ic. [t jutted and jar red the

and although t he tec hmcal 
aspect of creat ing the ounds 
was exacting, it pre ented 
itself to the audience with the 
poignancy of practicing scales. 

After t he intermission Lynn 
Becker performed a beautifu l 
rendition of Carlo Landioni's 
"Sonat a Per Flauto" on flute. 
Its fi ve sections maintained 
mu ch of t he trad it ion of 

Sonatas except -that it was 
written for solo flute instead of 
for flute and accompanyuing 
instrument. The piece didn't 
claim to be avant·guarde, as 
the listener could tell, but 
neither did it try to claim itself 
a a classical work. 

The final piece, Catherine 
Schieve's "Tiger's Eye," at 
firs t did much to revive my 
notion that absurdity was 
lurking nearby as it had in the 
first half of the program. Her 
piece for s ix clarinets de lved 
on the extreme limits of new 
darincl playing technique , 
much more so than Knopoff 's 
work. 

However, Faculty Clarinet 
is! William Powell, on solo 
clarinet seemed som ehow to 
ins till some magic into the 
ot her members of the UCSD 
Clarnet Quintet and make the 
piece a learning exper ience in 
lis tening. 

He also managed to squelch 
my fears t hat momentarily a 
train reall y would bust 100 e 
upon the stage and allow me to 
at least wave to the engineer as 
it chugged by. 

In a world of _I assassins, 
there is no room for an amateur. 

At 29, Charles Heller was 
a mC:!thematician without equal. 
At the CIA, he was 
a computer expert 
without peer. 
But when terrorists 
murdered the most 
important woman 
in his life, he became 
an assassin without 
experience. 
To avenge her death, 
the CIA trained him, 
briefed him, armed him, 
and then .. . 
they abandoned him. 
The first 11 minutes will absoiutely 
shock you . 
The last 11 minutes will rivet you 
to your seat.

The Au tralian film is rather 
different from American films 
in its rich cinematography and 
character portrayal. It's 
unfortunate that uch a fine 
collection of films are going to 
be shown while UCSD

for final . Still, this festival 
may be the ideal study break 
from last minute cramming 
for finals this quarter.
