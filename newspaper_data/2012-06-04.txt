Two associate vice president 
appointments were blocked at A.S. 
Council’s 10.5-hour meeting last 
week. 

Last Wednesday, March 30, A.S. 
Council approved new appointments 
to the open AVP positions based on 
recommendations by AVP selection 
committees. AVPs are responsible for 
overseeing various departments that 
focus on specific services. While they 
are not voting members of council, 
they receive a compensation package 
of around $3,500.

The selection committees are 
made of senators and an ex-officio 
representative that provide recom-
mendations to the executive in charge 
of the AVP’s office. At the last coun-
cil meeting, two candidates for AVP 
positions received recommendations 
from their respective committees, but 
were blocked by the respective vice 
president.

The AVP Local Affairs selection 
committee unanimously selected 
2011-12 Muir Senator Leah Wong for 
the position.

But when her appointment was 
put to a vote, an objection was 
raised and council closed its meet-
ing to the public for the next two 
hours. After doors re-opened, coun-
cil put the appointment to a second 
vote that failed. Council will not 
be able to appoint someone to the 
position until the beginning of Fall 
Quarter 2012.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Olamide Noah, who ultimately 
appoints the AVP Local Affairs posi-
tion, expressed concerns that Wong 
was not the most qualified candidate.

“I tried my absolute best to high-
light the fact that I’m doing every-
thing I’m doing according to the 
bylaws, and the rules enforced by 
council,” Noah said. 

AVP College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt said that council acted inap-
propriately and that it was crucial for 
someone to be appointed ASAP.

“I don’t doubt the intentions of the 
VP External, she just doesn’t believe 
Leah fits her vision but if the office 
is unfilled, not much can come out 
of it,” Bobbitt said. “Having these 
positions during summer is the most 
important time to have them, because 
with the students gone there needs to 
be someone who continues to advo-
cate on their behalf.”

It’s been a long wait for sociol-ogy professor Richard Biernacki. After fighting in court for two 
years —  and taking out a second 
mortgage to fund the attorney fees — 
Biernacki’s formerly banned manu-
script has finally been published. The 
work, titled Reinventing Evidence in 
Social Inquiry, was released for sale 

by Paul Grave Macmillan publishers 
this Sunday, June 3.

It has been over three years 
since the UCSD Social Sciences 
department placed a gag order on 
Biernacki’s manuscript, which is 
about peer review in the social sci-
ences. The order, written by Dean 
of Social Sciences Jeff Elman, asked 
Biernacki to stop “harassing” a col-
league within the UCSD Sociology 
Department whose research meth-
ods Biernacki critiqued in his book. 

The gag order also stated that 
Biernacki could be fired if he request-
ed data from the National Science 
Foundation. In response, Biernacki

UCSD Receives $100K Gates Grant

Staff Writer

UCSD’s Jacobs School of 
Engineering has received a grant 
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation for its “pregnancy tattoo” 
device used to monitor premature 
pregnancies. The Grand Challenges 
Explorations grant will provide 
$100,000 to the project’s first phase.

The project, called “Epidermal 
Electronics for Continuous 

Pregnancy Monitoring,” is headed 
by bioengineering professor Todd 
Coleman and University of Illinois 
Urbana-Champaign material science 
and engineering professor John A. 
Rogers. 

“The system provides an ultra-
thin, ultra-light, non intrusive 
platform for sensing physiological 
signals,” Coleman said. “It can be 
laminated onto the skin using a tem-
porary tattoo.” 

According to a May 9 UCSD press 

release, the scientists will use the 
device to monitor contractions, fetal 
heart rate and oxygen. The technolo-
gy has the potential to allow wireless 
and continuous pregnancy monitor-
ing of at-risk patients. 

The device consists of a flexible 
tattoo-like electronic system that is 
mounted on the skin. It is a patch 
made of circuits, sensors and wireless 
transmitters that can stick to the skin 
like an electronic tattoo. The monitor 
can flex and stretch with the skin as 

well as overcome problems of sweat-
ing and continuous cell turnover of 
the skin. 

The tattoo electronics are lami-
nated onto the belly of the mom and 
will continuously measure uterine 
contractions, EKG heart signals of 
the mom and fetus, body tempera-
ture and blood oxygenation of the 
mom. The measured signals will 
then be transmitted wirelessly on a

“It is the result of cutting edge 

research at the intersection of mate-
rials science, electrical engineer-
ing and biomedical engineering,” 
Coleman said.

The Grand Challenges 
Explorations grant program focuses 
on overcoming the most persistent 
challenges in global health. The Bill 
and Melinda Gates Foundation has 
donated $100 million to the grant. 
More than 700 grants have been 
awarded to early stage projects in 45 
different countries since the grant’s 
inception in 2008. 

“We have won the first phase of 
the Grand Challenge Grant, which 
is $100,000 over 18 months starting 
May 2012,” Coleman said. “A second 

round of funding for $1 million is 
available from the foundation pro-
vided we satisfactorily achieve our 
goals in the first phase.”

Coleman said that in the first 
phase, the researchers will test the 
device in UCSD hospitals while preg-
nant mothers are in labor. In the 
second phase, they will deploy the 
devices worldwide. 

“With the advance of epidermal 
electronics, we imagine that the 
boundaries between human bodies 
and electronics will continue to be 
blurred,” Coleman said. “New tech-
nology will enable us to interact with 
each other as well as with comput-

hired an attorney and took the case 
to court.  After two years of conflict, 
both in and out of court, the admin-
istration retracted its order last June.  
Biernacki said that the university 
administration’s misinterpretation 
of his work as a personal attack on 
another faculty member was both a 
personal and professional setback. 

“My salary was kept artificially 
low, because I wasn’t promoted,” he 
said. “The recognition that I would 
have received in my field two years 
ago did not come my way. I had to 
pay a steep attorney’s fee to fight the 
UC legal team in Oakland. Being on 
a level playing field is costly. If you 
have to bankrupt yourself to protect 
your academic freedom, then aca-
demic freedom is dead.”

Biernacki’s book states that peer 
review is frequently less thorough in 

the social sciences than in the natu-
ral sciences. Biernacki argues that 
this lack of peer review in his field 
has led to the widespread generation 
of data that is ambiguously valid and 
non-replicable. He said that his book 
was intended to be a methodological 
critique, not a personal attack.

“All the examples in the book 
are about problems that come along 
with trying to interpret the meaning 
of primary texts,” he said.

One of the book’s chapters 
appraises the reasoning used by 
sociologists to classify the state-
ments made in the autobiographies 
of Nazis. Another chapter critiques 
sociologists’ attempts to classify 
book reviews as positive or negative.

“I can see why people feel 
uncomfortable, because I’m cri-
tiquing methods that are so widely 
used,” he said. “But I’m not exempt. 
I’m critiquing my own use of these 

methods as well, because I have used 
them myself. I think social scientists 
treat each other with kid gloves, 
because we’re so unsure of what 
we’re doing.”

Biernacki said that a written 
order from the administration was 
the wrong avenue to use in handling 
his case. 

“If someone had a complaint 
about my critique, it’s the academ-
ic senate they should have gone 
through,” he said. “We have a fac-
ulty-run legal court on campus. We 
don’t need the administration to get 
involved.”

Diane Hamann, Director of the 
UCSD Academic Senate, could not 
be reached as of press time. Social 
Sciences Dean Jeff Elman is on  
sabbatical and could not be reached.

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU/GUARDIAN

THE ISSUE: Effective August 2012, the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services is requiring all new health 
insurance plans to cover women’s health services such as birth control, emergency contraceptives and abortion medications.

Under Control
Animal sacrifices are made every day in order to find new cures for diseases in 
biomedical science. Somehow, I 
have managed not to sacrifice many 
rodents; I’d rather study humans.

In science, we are told that the 
killing of animals is a “necessary 
evil” in order to model the types of 
diseases that we are trying to cure. It’s 

true. Most of what we know about 
the human body, even basic things 
like blood flow, comes from studying 
animals. The polio vaccine, discovered 
by Jonas Salk, harvested this virus 
from animal brains, then tested it on 
monkeys. However, he didn’t receive 
the 1954 Physiology and Medicine 
Nobel Prize (although many people 
feel he should have). Instead, it went 
to three scientists that cultivated it in 
human skin-muscle tissue, making it 
capable for mass production without 
being extracted from animal brains. 

Although much of what we learn 
in medical and pharmaceutical 
science comes from animal models, 
we can’t immediately translate our 
results to humans. For example, Ron 
Evans’s group at the Salk Institute 
famously discovered an “exercise 
pill” (AICAR) that improved the 
endurance of mice, but failed to ever 
work in humans.

It’s also difficult to generate 
animal models of complex psychiatric 
disorders, like schizophrenia. 
Researchers try to emulate 
schizophrenia in mice by giving 
them high doses of ketamine, an 
animal tranquilizer that doubles as a 
raver drug among humans. Another 
new schizophrenia model recently 
published in 2011 gives mice chronic 
doses of LSD. 

Over the past few years, a 
technology has emerged that 
could help us learn more about 
schizophrenia. In 2007, Shinya 
Yamanaka’s group (Kyoto University, 
Japan) successfully made the first 
human pluripotent stem cells from 
human adult skin cells, and many 
scientists believe that he will receive 
the Nobel Prize for it. Utilizing this 
technology, “Rusty” Gage’s group 
(Brennand et al.) at the Salk Institute 
published the 2011 paper: “Modeling 
schizophrenia using human IPS 
cells.” Essentially, they took skin cells 
from schizophrenic patients, turned 
them into neurons, and compared 
them to neurons that were derived 
the same way from people without 
schizophrenia. Then they were treated 
with an antipsychotic to see what the 
effect would be. The major novelty 
was that the neurons came from the 
skin of a person with schizophrenia, 
instead of the brain of a mouse that 
had been frying on ketamine or LSD. 

The San Diego community seems 
supportive of this type of research. 
Right by Gliderport stands the newly 
erected Sanford Consortium for 
Regenerative Medicine, a collaborative 
effort between UCSD and four other 
world class institutions. This center 
will focus on developing these types 
of technologies for translational 
medicine. Kudos.

QUICK TAKES

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act mandates that all health insurance plans 
provided by employers and universities must 
cover “women’s health services,” including 
birth control and Plan B with no co-pay. This 
has created a political firestorm for the Obama 
Administration, as religious universities 
strongly oppose this measure on religious and 
moral grounds. These universities have valid 
arguments, as it is not a university’s obligation to 
cover birth control and students are competent 
enough to find contraceptive solutions 
themselves.

While schools should not be required to offer 
emergency contraceptives carte blanche, they can 
take steps to ensure students have the knowledge 
of where and how they can acquire birth control 
or emergency contraceptives.

 In a May 2012 study by Eszter Hargittai 
and Heather Young of Northwestern University, 
one in three students could not find any 
relevant information regarding emergency 
contraceptives online, and a majority could not 
find an efficient way to obtain contraception in 
general. Universities can at the very least provide 
pamphlets that give the locations of pharmacies 
or clinics within a reasonable radius that offer 
such services.

The problem becomes murkier for students 
who attend college in rural areas — where 
pharmacies and clinics are not as bountiful. It is 
then up to the university to advocate the building 
of clinics nearby,  or arranging transportation to 
such places if they are located far away.

It is not a learning institution’s responsibility 
to provide birth control, but it is their 
responsibility to give students the tools that they 
need to find birth control at a clinic or pharmacy 
near them. Though schools should solve this 
problem without violating their own religious 
standards, the schools should do so with 
minimal invasiveness to the privacy of students 
and allow students to retain their dignity while 
seeking medical services.

— ALEKS LEVIN
Staff Writer

This past January, the White House Department 
of Health and Human Services announced that 
under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act, all employers must fully cover women’s health 
services including such contraceptive medications 
as the “morning after” pill. Since then, a slew of 
Catholic colleges and universities have sued the 
department over the mandate. As understandable 
as their aversion to contraceptives may be, 
administrators at religious and secular universities 
alike should meet the need for birth control that 
exists on their campuses. 

Around 77 percent of pregnancies in college 
are unplanned, according to a 2008 report 
published by the National Campaign to End Teen 
and Unplanned Pregnancy. The study found no 
significant difference in pregnancy rates between 
students at religious and public universities. 
Given these statistics, it is unrealistic for Catholic 
universities to expect — as they currently do — 
that their students engage in abstinence, and that 
they therefore do not need contraceptives. 

According to statistics released in 2011 by the 
Guttmacher Institute, a NYC and Washington 
DC based non-profit organization that conducts 
reproductive health research, 98 percent of sexually 
active Catholic women aged 15 to 44 have used 
contraception. Eighty-one percent of students at 
Catholic universities are Catholic. Moreover, 58 
percent of Catholics — higher than the national 
average of 55 percent — say that religiously 
affiliated colleges should be required to cover birth 
control as part of student health insurance. 

The National Campaign’s report found that 
the abortion rate was higher in regions where 
contraceptives were not readily available. This 
makes sense, given the stigma surrounding 
contraception at religious universities. 

Sexual activity is a reality at all college 
campuses, including religious ones. To avoid 
unplanned pregnancies and abortions among 
university students, contraception should be made 
available, regardless of a university’s religious 
affiliation.  

— AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

Under President Obama’s new Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, all health 
insurance plans will be required to include 
women’s health services including contraception, 
sterilization and abortion-inducing medications. 
Although this mandate will benefit a great 
number of women, the law ultimately infringes on 
the First Amendment rights of private religious 
groups to oppose contraception.

Notre Dame University, a well-known 
Catholic school, is one of many groups that are 
filing lawsuits against the legislation. Notre Dame 
Student Health Services will now have to offer 
birth control pills to students without charge, 
which goes against the religious beliefs that the 
university was founded upon and still follows. 
Universities like Notre Dame should not have to 
violate their own rights to express their religious 
views in order to abide by the law.

Due to this act, a few religious universities 
including Ave Maria University have shut down 
student health centers and decided not to offer 
health services for their students. The college will 
still require students to have health insurance, 
but the cost of an insurance plan outside the 
university is undoubtedly much higher. The 
school is choosing to put the convenience of its 
students aside to uphold its religious values.

The PPAC act should accommodate the 
values of religious groups by softening the 
requirement instead of enforcing this legislation 
on ‘all health insurance plans. The act specifically 
allows churches to opt out but does not lift the 
requirement for religious nonprofits including 
universities and hospitals. These religious 
establishments should receive the same treatment 
as houses of worship because both are founded on 
age-old religious principles.

Even if religious universities claim exemption 
from this law, students will still have a wide 
variety of resources off campus to obtain 
contraception, and this is a much better 
alternative to students having no access to health 
services on campus.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Chancellor Khosla,
I am an Associate Professor in the 

Department of Literature as well as an 
affiliated faculty of Ethnic Studies and 
the Critical Gender Studies Program. 
I am also the Vice President of the 
San Diego Faculty Association, a local 
chapter of the American Association 
of University Professors. I am also one 

of the faculty members who joined 
the Black Student Union, Mecha and 
other student organizations to protest 
the racist, homophobic, sexist and 
classist incidents that occurred on 
our campus in 2010. Finally, I am a 
supporter of labor groups on campus, 
especially AFSCME. While you look 
forward to a six digit salary and many 
other perks, our brothers and sisters 
from AFSCME are being asked to 
work more hours for the same or less 
money while putting their health at 
severe risk. 

I’m not telling you all of this to 
legitimize myself or to speak for 
any of these groups.  I am letting 
you know who I am and who I have 
been in contact with for the past 
seven years — years in which I have 
listened and heard many concerns.  I 
am writing this letter to express one 
concern that is shared by many. Like 
many students, faculty  and workers, 
I never had the opportunity to ask 
you questions in an open, unscripted 
forum when you were a candidate 
(hint: organize such a forum. It is 

never too late). I read with curiosity 
and attention your interview in the 
Guardian, and I have some doubts, 
questions and comments about your 
responses.  

In response to a question about 
the future direction of the university, 
you said that UCSD “has achieved 
a lot in the last 50 years. And it has 
achieved that partly because of the 
entrepreneurial nature of the faculty, 
partly because of strong leadership

Promises Have Substance

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JUNE 4,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

and partly because of both.” My 
Translation: you are mostly concerned 
about the profit-making centers of the 
university, mainly the hospitals and 
research centers that are connected to 
federal grants and corporate interests. 
Many of us are not surprised that you 
see the university as a corporation 
and yourself as a CEO. We know that 
you managed a $50 million portfolio 
for DARPA (a military agency) 
and that you served as a consultant 
for several companies and venture 
capitalists.  However, we are also 
part of this public university, and we 
ask you: Do those of us who are not 
entrepreneurs or revenue generators 
have a place at UCSD?  Do those who 
work in academic fields that promote 
the public good over profit motives 
have a future at UCSD? 

The typical response to this 
concern is that UCSD development 
teams are working on raising funds 
for the Humanities and those fields 
that cannot support themselves. 
It is always so interesting how 
administrators label the things 
they like to expend money on (i.e. 
chancellor’s salaries) as “investments,” 
while the things they don’t like to 
expend money on (i.e. humanities 
departments) are labeled as “costs.” 
The problem, however, is that even 
accepting your philanthropic logic, 
there are entire fields of knowledge 
and disciplines that “do not get 
donors excited.” Are we condemned, 
then, to sacrifice entire fields of 
knowledge on the altar of corporate 
interests? 

When you were asked about the 
possibility of increasing student fees 
6 percent in the fall, you said you 
wished there was a magic bullet to 
avoid tuition increases. You added 
that without this magic bullet the 
way to fix the lack of funds “is over 
time, to raise more money for student 

scholarships, for undergraduate 
scholarships. But that is a process 
that can take one, two, three decades, 
to get to a point where everybody 
can go to school for free, it’s nearly 
impossible.”  My Translation: You will 
support any tuition increases in the 
near future regardless of the effect 
that it may have on the students and 
their families.  You appear to be a 
supporter of the so-called “Michigan 
Model” of high tuition with high aid 
— that is to say, passing the “cost” of 
education to the “student/consumer.”  

Do you know that this model 
generates astronomical student 
debt and that it disproportionately 
affects working class students and 
students of color? In this regard, 
Bob Meister, a Professor of UC 
Santa Cruz, writes that, “the price 
of public higher education has 
been growing at twice the rate of 
the economy, twice as fast as health 
insurance, and three to four times 
more quickly than consumer prices 
in general” (“Debt and Taxes: Can 
the Financial Industry Save Public 
Universities? Privatization Is Now 
the Problem—Not the Solution”). 
Are you going to participate in the 
expansion and consolidation of the 
student debt bubble or will you make 
a firm commitment to consider other 
options? 

Finally, you were asked about 
the future of diversity initiatives on 
campus and you responded: “clearly I 
have a goal of increasing enrollment, 
but I have to work with my senior 
staff, the faculty and students, because 
I’m sure there are many good ideas 
floating around that I am unaware 
of.” My Translation: Like Chancellor 
Fox and the UCSD administration, 
you think that racism and lack of 
diversity at UCSD have been resolved, 
so you plan on taking a dangerously 
passive approach that has been the 
modus operandi of administrators. 
The problem is that there are signs of 

continued deterioration, because the 
problem is structural. The so-called 
“Compton Cookout” emerged from 
a long history of structural inequality 
at UCSD. Because of the brave 
actions of students, especially the 
groups previously mentioned, the 
administration had to face some of 
these problems. Yet, they addressed 
the issue only superficially, never 
getting at the roots or systemic 
problems. They put a band-aid on 
things, and then used the students’ 
struggles in their slick marketing 
campaigns to promote “campus 
diversity.” Contrary to that fantasy 
of campus, UCSD continues to 
be a toxic space for historically 
underrepresented minorities on 
campus, especially Muslim and Arab 
American students. I don’t have a 

quantitative study to substantiate 
this claim, but I have eyes, ears, and 
a heart. At the very least, Chancellor 
Khosla, you should commit the 
funding for the BSU resource center 
out of UCSD money. Do not wait for 
private donations. Your support for 
this effort would be a step in the right 
direction and a sign of good faith.

I realize that many members 
of the community may think it is 
too soon to raise these criticisms. 
Unfortunately, after seven years at 
this institution I have learned to 
expect nothing but empty words 
from the administration. Perhaps 
you can prove me wrong. Perhaps 
you can show me and the UCSD 
community that there was a deeper 
substance behind your words in the 
recent interview. Then, I would be 

the first to admit that I was “lost in 
translation.” Prove me wrong, and I’d 
be happy to sit down there with you 
and the people. We could talk, listen, 
and imagine new ways of opening the 
doors of the university to everybody 
in the state of California, regardless 
of class, race, gender or ethnicity and 
honor the heritage of the California 
Master Plan. If this sounds too much 
like fiction to you, then I guess I 
will see you at the next protest in 
the Chancellor Office Complex, or 
at the next building reclamation, 
or wherever there are good people 
opposing the full privatization of the 
UC system.

For the first time since I created my Facebook over five years ago, I have chosen not to list 
anything under my “Political Views.” 
Until now, I’ve attempted to sum-
marize my beliefs in a concise little 
textbox with a one-word descriptive 
like “liberal,” “moderate” or the cliché 
YouTube link to the idealistic and 
inspiring “The Greatest Speech Ever 
Made” by Charlie Chaplin. I even 
went through a phase when I was 
disenchanted by the politics, and all 
I wanted to do in life was become 
an Impressionist painter. Even then, 
I still didn’t want to leave the box 
blank. So I listed my political views as 
“Gustav Klimt.”

But now I’m finally acknowledg-
ing my life-long identity crisis. After 
20 years, it’s just now that I realize 
how little I know, and how unquali-
fied I am to imply a certain correct-
ness in a one-worded political ideol-
ogy by listing it under my “political 
views.” By admitting that, and con-
sequently deleting that part of my 
profile, I’m accepting that I don’t have 
all the answers.

As editor of the Focus section, 
I’ve found that my section mirrors 
this realization. It’s been over 20 years 
since Focus (which used to go by 
“Perspective”) was created. It’s been 
loosely defined as a “features” sec-
tion, running articles that are longer, 

less time sensitive and written with a 
lighter voice than news pieces.

But after the two-plus decades 
since its nascence, Focus still begs 
for an identity, often referred to as a 
“catch-all” or “filler.”  Being the Focus 
editor has been a unique struggle. 
Aside from the universal challenges 
of a newspaper editor, like meeting 
deadlines, grappling with typos and 
AP style errors and trying not to mess 
up photo and art credits, it’s hard to 
determine what role Focus should 
play in the Guardian. I feel like I’ve 
been in charge of raising a bright, but 
shy teenager uncertain of his role in 
the world.

It’s a struggle that resonates with 
all of us.

As college students, we fear the 
looming future. We squirm uncom-
fortably when people ask us, “What 
are you doing after graduation?” As 
we grapple with our own undevel-
oped sense of purpose, we are also at a 
uniquely challenging moment in time 
as we face a stagnant economy, lack-
luster job market and ever-growing 
student debt. If only there were a one-
word answer to all of these challenges 
that could fit into your Facebook pro-
file and provide the solutions. 

But during crises and hardships, 
we have the opportunity to look at

In the battle against cancer, researchers at the San Diego Supercomputer Center are shed-
ding new light on the mysteries of 
the human cell that might unlock 
possibilities for anti-cancer drugs. 
These new findings about a copper 
transporting “pump” within cellular 
membranes might give scientists a 
new means of understanding cancer-
ous cells.

The team — composed of San 
Diego Supercomputer Center 
research scientists Igor Tsigelny, Yuriy 
Sharikov, Jerry P. Greenberg, Mark 
A. Miller, Valentina L. Kouzentsova, 
Christopher A. Larson and Professor 
Stephen B. Howell of the UCSD 
School of Medicine — recently pub-
lished their findings in journal Cell 
Biochemistry and Biophysics on May 
9.

Cancer is the second leading 
cause of death in the United States 
behind heart disease, and accounts for 
almost one of every four deaths in the 
nation. According to statistics gath-
ered by The American Cancer Society, 
1,638,910 new cases are expected for 
2012.

Traditionally, one of the great-
est challenges of cancer treatment is 
finding a way to deliver the effective 
medicines to the cancerous cells in a 
person’s body. There have been mul-
tiple medicines that destroy cancer 
cells, but over time are found to have 
less and less of an effect during can-
cerous relapses.

But what the team of researchers 
recently discovered is the importance 
of one element: copper.

The human copper transporter 1 
protein (hTCR1) is a critical pump 

located in the membranes of human 
cells that allows for copper atoms to 
pass into the cell cytoplasm. While 
the body needs only a small amount 
of copper, it’s a vital component in 
creating cellular enzymes and used 
in the performance of other bodily 
functions.

 In addition, the protein is also 
used to transport cisplatin, one of 
the most commonly used anti-cancer 
drugs. Unfortunately, most anti-can-
cer drugs lose their effectiveness over 
time. Some researchers have theo-
rized that this diminishment could be 
caused by the cancerous cells some-
how warping the gateway into the cell.

In order to study this elusive 
phenomenon of diminishment, the 
research team created a complete 3D 
model of the transporter protein to 
find answers and better understand 
how the pump works. Tsigelny’s team 
invented a brand new programming 
tool named METBIND for their 
experiment. METBIND scoured the 
transporter protein samples for traces 
of any atom that could potentially be 
a copper ion.

According to the 3D model, the 
copper transport protein forms a tri-
mer  — a structure composed of three 
proteins — within the cell’s mem-
brane, with the top end sticking out-
side of the cell and the bottom end 
extending into the cell’s cytoplasm. 
This structure, including six receptor 
sites that signal the cell’s interactions, 
and nine negatively charged amino 
acids that latch onto copper ions com-
bine to create a pumping system that 
allows copper to enter and exit the 
cell.

“This model is instrumental in 

understanding the structural compo-
sition of the protein,” Stephen Howell 
said. Howell, a professor of medicine 
at the UCSD School of Medicine and 
associate director of clinical research 
at the UC San Diego Moores Cancer 
Center, specializes in research that 
focuses heavily on the interactions of 
cisplatin and the DNA of tumor cells.

“This has helped us to understand 
how the transporter uses its compo-
nents to bring different material into 
the cell,” Howell said.

These findings could allow 
researchers to begin mapping out 
potential blue prints for enhanced 

anti-cancer drugs that use the hTCR1 
and can better travel through the 
transporter without losing any poten-
cy. However, there is still much work 
to be done.

“It is important to note that we 
have to be careful that it is only a 
model,” Howell said. “There are still 
many different tests and experiments 
that have to be run.”

“The next steps would be addi-
tional mutations in the protein, and 
see if this inhibits or increases the 
hTCR1’s capacity to transport copper,” 
Howell said. “For example, we should 
predict that if X protein or acid is 

altered, then it will change the ability 
to transport copper.”

A stronger version of cisplatin or a 
new drug in the battle against cancer 
is still a long time away. However, 
the findings of Tsigelny and his team 
provide a new platform from which 
scientists can explore. Thanks to their 
efforts, cancer patients in the future 
may have the possibility of a chemo-
therapy treatment that lasts longer 
and acts stronger against a disease that 
has plagued people around the world.

At a time when classic book-binding is challenged by the advent of Kindles and com-
puters, contemporary artists are find-
ing ways to turn the age-old book 
into new works of design. At the San 
Diego Book Arts Fourth National 
Juried Exhibition held in Geisel 
Library and co-sponsored by UCSD’s 
Mandeville Special Collections 
Library, these old books can be found 
transformed by innovative combi-
nations of images, text and format, 
revealing both the creative process 
and the soul of the book artists.

From the images of approximately 
200 artists’ books submitted electron-
ically from across the country, 60 that 
demonstrated creative typography 
and binding skills have been selected 
to be featured in the exhibition run-
ning until July 8, 2012. Examples of 
transformations include making the 
iTouch into the future book, rolling 
up papers of the book into threads 
for knitting and forming beeswaxes 
into fortune cookies with narrative 
teabag tags. 

As the director of the Mandeville 
Special Collections Library and a 
board member of San Diego Book 
Arts, Lynda Claassen has been play-
ing a significant role in this biannual 
exhibition as a head coordinator.  

“Geisel is a perfect place to hold 
the exhibition because here in the 
Special Collections, we already have 
a very significant collection of art-
ists’ books as part of the permanent 
collection and we have a national 

reputation for that,” Claassen said.
Book artists convey their ideas 

through a myriad of elements — 
images, words, materials, forms, col-
ors and shapes — instead of just text, 
to create their narratives in some 
kind of a book form. 

“Book art is a synthesis of form 
and content that provides us a bridge 
between the traditional book and 
contemporary art,” Claassen said. 
“The creative opportunity to struc-
ture, format and interpret book art 
is endless – dreams and imagination 
has not gone wanting here.”

Time dedicated to book arts var-
ies from book artist to book artist. 
According to Claassen, some book 
artists spend years finding inspira-
tion and completing their pieces, but 
others are stricken with an idea and 
finish in a couple months. 

The opening reception was held 
on June 2. As the juror of this year, 
the book artist and the sole propri-
etor of Ninja Press, Carolee Campbell 
came to decide the winner of the 
exhibition, a new rule that has been 
introduced this year. 

“I’m not sure how I feel about 
selecting a winner for the prize,” 
Campbell said. “There shouldn’t be 
a standard at which a juror is to 
judge the quality of art works. Who 
is to judge the amount of time and 
effort the book artists put into their 
works?”

the underlying forces, the mechanics 
of the institutions that not only con-
trol our lives, but that we often are in 
control of. It’s when we struggle with 
finding the answers that we realize 
how little we’ve known all along.

Ending the year, I’m still not sure 
how to describe Focus. But I think I’m 
onto something. There’s decisiveness 
to indecisiveness. The blank “political 
views” on my Facebook implies an 
explorative state. The lack of a belief 
system defines me perfectly well—it 
reflects my eagerness to learn, and 
my continued dedication to finding 
truth. 

And Focus may not provide the 
answers, but acknowledges the ques-
tion, and seeks to explore. And I 
believe the right questions are much 
more important than haphazard 
answers.

With this knowledge, or lack 
thereof, I’m optimistic about Focus’s 
role as we end this year and begin the 
next. We plan on linking Focus with 
news, and running even more inves-
tigative articles taking a closer look 
at the issues covered briefly in news. 
And by keeping around the pro-
files, science features and InFocuses, 
we plan on giving students a small 
glimpse of the enormous and vibrant 
culture at UCSD.

I’m one confused 20-year-old, 
but with every Lady music session 
with Editor-in-Chief and good friend 
Angela Chen, my young soul grows 
wiser (I recommend “Yankin’” and 
“Teach Y’all” if you seek some good 
old fashioned female empowerment). 
With the year to come, I’m excited to 
witness Focus’s own soul search.

PATRICK WATSON AT THE LOFT - THE LOFT 
Patrick Watson first broke through to audiences in 
2006 with his album Close to Paradise. Watson's 
latest offering, entitled Adventures in Your Own 
Backyard, is in his own words, an effort on the 
band's part to 'make the kind of music we would 
want to listen to at home'. The album's title is both a 
nod to this sentiment, and to the fact that it was 
recorded almost entirely in Watson's apartment in 
Montreal. Both Close to Paradise and Wooden Arms 
were recorded over long periods of time, in many 
different places. Wooden Arms is especially scattered 
in its geography, with a number of the songs having 
been informed by the band's extensive travels in the 
wake of the success of Close to Paradise.

Networks (MTN) from a transnational perspective. 
Religion, paisanaje, bounded solidarity, and enforceable 
trust are among the social mechanisms that influence 
the behavior of network participants to act collectively, 
trust one another, and offer mutual support in the 
challenges of migration. Assisting fellow migrants is 
expected of MTN members, while reciprocating the 
assistance is not. Instead, a form of risk pooling occurs 
in which migrants 'return' favors by helping future 
migrants. Nadia Y. Flores-Yeffal is an Assistant Professor

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JUNE 4,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

to first-seed Loyola Marymount.
Regardless, the UCSD Women’s 

Water Polo team finished the season 
with a 21–14 overall record, tallying 
the most wins in a single season since 
2003. 

UCSD ended the regular season in 
second place, behind No. 7 nationally 
ranked Loyola, much to the credit of 
the Tritons’ five graduating seniors 
— Kirsten Bates, Katherine Biehle, 
Jessica Tran, Natalie Peng and 
Allie Taylor — along with WWPA 
newcomer of the year Rachel Brooks 
and sophomore standout Sarah 
Lizotte. 

In 2013: The 2013 squad will 
certainly look much different from 
the team fielded in 2012. 

A lot will be riding on the 
incoming class of recruits, as the 
Tritons will lose five of their seven 
starters. 

UCSD has plenty of talent on the 
bench. Sophomores Lizotte, center 
Melissa Bartow and utility Leah 
Gonzales will likely be tasked with 
stepping into leadership positions in 
the coming season. 

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL
Record: 21-5

Despite finishing regular season 
play with a 21–5 overall record, 
17–5 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, the 2012 season counts as 
one of the men’s volleyball team’s best 
finishes in program history.

As the only Division-II team in 
their conference, amongst perennial 
powerhouses UCLA, Stanford and 
BYU, the Tritons have always been 
considered the underdogs. 

Coupled with the loss of two of 
the Tritons’ best players — setter Phil 
Bannan and middle blocker Calvin 
Ross — UCSD came into 2012 leaning 
heavily on their underclassmen.

The Tritons’ younger players 

stepped up. Junior outside hitter Carl 
Eberts and freshman Chase Frishman 
both garnered All-MPSF honors, 
while sophomores Vaun Lennon and 
Sebastian Brady both had breakout 
seasons.

In 2013: Looking to improve on 
2012’s 21-5 record, the Tritons will 
return their entire roster to the court 
next season. 

And with an extra year of 
experience under their belt, a new 
set of incoming recruits and the same 
coaching staff, UCSD is sure to look 
dangerous in 2013.

MEN’S TENNIS
Record: 13-10

The men’s tennis team won 12 
of its first 14 matches, before falling 
off and out of the national rankings 
by stringing together eight straight 
losses. 

The Tritons finished with a 13–10 
overall record, although a bad end to 
the season killed any hope for NCAA 
qualification. 

The doubles team of junior Austin 
West and sophomore Devon Sousa 
had an exceptional start. 

The pair took the title at the 
USTA/ITA West Regionals to qualify 
for the National Small College 
Championships. 

West and Sousa also won the UC 
Santa Barbara Doubles title. The duo 
was unable to sustain their success 
down the stretch.

In singles competition, freshman 
Max Jiganti proved to be the Tritons’ 
most consistent performer, winning 
19 of his 22 matches in the No. 3 or 4 
singles spot. 

In 2013: The Tritons will continue 
into 2013 without graduating seniors 
Chapman Chan, Sam Ling and Jason 
Wall — three of UCSD’s strongest 
singles players.

However, this season’s 
underclassmen — particularly Jiganti 

and No. 4 singles Kona Luu, along 
with junior Junya Yoshida have 
shown promise.

The Tritons are also likely to 
remain strong in doubles competition.

WOMEN’S TENNIS

Record: 8-15
The women’s tennis team finished 

2012 well under .500 with an 8–15 
record — far worse than 2011’s 13–10 
overall record. 

No player on the Triton roster 
is over .500 in individual matches, 
although seniors Katie Mulloy and 
Krystal Mizugochi are both 9–8 in 
their singles matches. Sophomore 
Tara Vanooteghem and senior 
Samantha Yeung are both 10–12.

In 2013: The Tritons have a lot 
of room for improvement. Although 
they will lose Mulloy, Mizuguchi 
and Yeung, UCSD will retain 
their No. 1 doubles pair of juniors 
Melissa Breisacher and Jacquelyn 
Davis. 

GOLF
 Even with the loss of Triton Keith 

Okasaki — likely the best golfer to 
come through the program since 
UCSD’s move to Division II — the 
UCSD Golf team had one of its best 
seasons to date. 

In 2012, the Tritons earned a 
team-qualifying berth to the NCAA 
Regionals, after collecting four top-
five finishes throughout the season.

In 2013: UCSD finished 14th at 
the Super Regional, but the Tritons 
look to be in good shape going into 
the next season.

UCSD will return its entire roster, 
which includes standouts freshmen 
Jay Lim and Marc Herrmann and 
sophomore Lewis Simon.

SPRING SPORTS 
WRAP UP

BY RACHEL UDA •  SportS Editor

SOFTBALL
Record: 23-13

The UCSD softball team’s 
postseason run counts as one of the 
most remarkable in the program’s 
history. After finishing season play 
with a 23–13 record to just barely 
qualify for the CCAA tournament 
with the fourth-seed, the nationally 
unranked Tritons upset their CCAA 
opponents to clinch a spot in the 
West Regionals.

The sixth-seeded Tritons fought 
their way through eight games, going 
6–2 to enter the College World Series 
as the lowest ranked squad. But 
pitching just one arm — two-time 
All-American Camille Gaito — the 
Tritons fell short in the title game 
to No. 1 nationally ranked Valdosta 
State in the title game.

In 2013: UCSD will return all but 
four of its roster, but head coach Patti 
Gerckens will have some holes to fill.

The Tritons graduate Gaito — 
arguably the best pitcher in Division 
II — as well as senior centerfielder 
Kris Lesovsky. All-American 
Lesovsky currently leads the team in 
batting average, slugging percentage, 
on-base percentage, runs and hits. 
The four-time letter winner has also 
served as the Tritons’ leadoff hitter 
for the past four seasons.

Still, UCSD will retain the likes 
of All-CCAA selections sophomores 
Caitlin Brown, Kirsten Willmon and 
Charly Swanberg, to continue strong 
into 2013.

BASEBALL
Record: 33-24

The 2012 season could have been 
dismissed as a rebuilding year. 

After the Tritons graduated their 
ace Tim Shibuya — now playing 
for the Minnesota Twins’ farms 
system — and long-time coach Dan 
O’Brien left his post for a position at 
Division-I Santa Clara University, no 

one expected much from the Triton 
Baseball team. 

But with a new coaching staff that 
included head coach Dan O’Brien 
and former MLB All-Star Morgan 
Ensberg, the 2012 squad refused to 

lie down.
The Tritons logged a tough start 

to the beginning of the season, but 
rebounded midway in the year to 
capture the regular season title and the 
CCAA tournament championship.

Unfortunately, the Tritons’ end-
of-season momentum wasn’t enough 
to pull the squad through the four-
team West Region finals.

In 2013: Despite losing for the 
second straight time in the West 
Regional round, the Tritons will come 
into 2013 with only one Triton — 
Gregg Ringold — missing from their 
batting order.

All West Region selection 
centerfielder Danny Susdorf will 
return to leadoff along with the 
CCAA’s Most Outstanding Player 
Nick La Face.

The UCSD bullpen, on the other 
hand, will graduate five of its best 
arms — Justin Burns, Jeff Rauh, Greg 
Selarz, Elias Tuma and Tony York. 
The Tritons will retain junior right-
hander Ryan Goodbrand (11–0), who 

garnered All-CCAA and All West 
Region honors. The junior, who 
hasn’t seen much time on the mound 
in his previous seasons, has grown to 
become UCSD’s most reliable starter.

TRACK & FIELD
 The UCSD Men’s Track and 

Field team finished the regular 
season in third place behind CSU 
Chico and CSU Los Angeles in the 
CCAA tournament, while the women 
finished second behind Chico for the 
third straight year.

Both the men’s and women’s teams 
relied on the performances of their 
underclassmen, in lieu of several 
graduated perennial senior podium-
winners. Freshman Sabrina Pimentel 
won the 800m in dramatic fashion 
while fellow freshman Nash Howe 
came in second in the javelin. 

Pimentel — a member of the All-
American 4x4 team of Irish, Roberson 
and Rose — is the first freshman to 
get to nationals on the women’s side 
since six-time All-American Kelly 
Fogarty did way back in 2008.

Keith Rose, another freshman, 
broke the 200m school record at the 
CCAA meet and is now training 
as a guide for blind athletes in the 
upcoming London Paralympics. 

Rose is the first Triton male 
sprinter to have a shot at an All-
American title at the Division-II 
level. Next year the team has another 
faster sprinter, incoming freshman 
Chad Smith. A graduating senior of 
El Capitan High School, Smith has 
already run faster than Rose in both 
the 200m and the 100m.

This year’s top-performing 
seniors included Deyna Roberson, 
who provisionally qualified for the 
400m hurdles and was a member 
of the 4x400 team. Caitlin Meagher 
provisionally qualified in the 400m 
hurdles, and finished 2nd at CCAAs 
in the 100m hurdles.

Jacqueline Rose, team sprint 

captain, won the 400m, 200m, 
4x1 and 4x400 at the CCAA meet 
and then continued to garner All-
American status in both the 400m 
and 4x4 at NCAAs.

On the men’s side, Senior Ka Wai 
Ng finished second at NCAAs after 
winning the conference meet. Team 
captain Nick Howe won his fourth 
consecutive CCAA title and finished 
5th at NCAAs. 

Donnie Douangchak is also 
graduating after breaking the 150’ 
barrier in the hammer at CCAAs.

Graduating so few seniors means 
the team, with an incoming freshman 
class of more than twenty females 
and ten males, will be in serious 
contention for a CCAA crown.

“We had a great 2012 season, both 
men and women,” head women’s 
coach Darcy Ahner said. “They were 
able to overcome some gaps in depth 
by really stepping it up elsewhere and 
competing great.”

Record: 21-14

The Tritons’ season came to a 
close after narrowly missing out on a 
NCAA playoff berth with a 7–6 loss 

See SPRING, page 11

The No. 24 UCSD Women’s Softball team made their second consecutive appearance at the College World Series. The No. 24 Tritons fell in the title match to No. 1 Valdosta State.

Perception  
and the
Athlete’s 
Performance

I n the world of sports, the influence of perception plays a vital role in the performance of 
athletes. Whether it is an individual 
sport such as track and field or a 

team sport like soccer, how athletes 
feel about the space in which they’re 
competing has a profound impact on 
their performance.

Boiling things down: If you look 
good and feel good, you play well. 
In that order. If a place is designed 
to make you feel good, you will 
perform well there. Certainly, many 
things come into play in creating an 
atmosphere beyond just the buildings 
and landscaping, namely; memories 
of past victories or losses make a 
difference in the mental state for 
positive or negative reactions. 

The latest instances I have 
experienced were at NCAAs in 
Pueblo, CO and at the recent UCLA 
meet at Drake Stadium.

In Pueblo, the throwing fields 
were still being laid as we arrived for 
practice on Wednesday afternoon. 
The discus field was made out of 
dirt rather than grass, something our 
coaches have never seen at an NCAA 
National meet in their combined 
50-plus years of coaching across the 
country. The end of that field went 
straight into a ditch 30 feet deep. 

Lined up next to this field was the 
javelin runway, which was a narrowly 
defined patch of grass that ended 
abruptly at 230’ in dirt and another 
ditch.

Despite these conditions, however, 
several throwers had personal best 
throws while other choked (like 
myself). Those athletes weren’t 
concerned with the conditions, I was.

The banquet dinner, with the blue 
NCAA logo painted across the newly 
laid grass, put them in a perceived 
location above the actual dusty, 
40-miles per hour wind. 

Those athletes transcended their 
surroundings to achieve their goals. 
This self-reality, this dreamland 
created by those athletes is needed 
when visiting teams visit hostile 
environments in foreign trips. 

This past Saturday, June 2nd, the 
sun was out and dispersing 78-degree 
heat evenly across the runway, was 
a perfect day. The state of mind on 
that day, and the perfect conditions, 
while not producing a great mark for 
any of us, still set us all up with the 
confidence needed to really put it all 
on the line this coming Saturday, June 
9 at the Olympic Training Center in 
Chula Vista. 

While the stage is not the entire 
play, it does help that the actors know 
their role better and it can make 
a huge difference in the emotions 
perceived and expected from a 
situation. For us, the perceived and 
real often combine to either help us 
turn a poor situation into a dream, 
or a great situation into an even 
better one. Then again, it can be 
your downfall and lead to some of us 
choking.
