Revamped language program working 
Some problems surround student proficiency, though 

BY RALPH RAINWATER 
When the literature and 

linguistics programs were 
overhauled last year, with 
Language 5 and 6 cancelled, 
department administrators 
expected that there would be 
a few problems with class 
overcrowding. 

What they didn't expect 
were all the difficulties that 
accompany reclassifying 
displaced students in ability 
levels. 

According to Professor 
James Lyon, literature 
department chairman, 
foreign language literature 
classes that in the past had 

focused on reading and 
comprehension now empha· 
size grammar because 
enrolled students have lower 
language proficiencies. 

This problem arose 

rrimaril y because the iterature department 
absorbed many of the 
students displaced from the 
upper levels of the linguistics 
language program. 

Many students complained 
that the "prognostic" exams 
that were given to classify 
them did not successfully 
estimate their grammatical 
ability. 

But Lyons says, "Under no

circumstances when we gave 
tho e te ts did we force 
students to go to different 
levels. We only advised 
them." 

Another problem encount· 
ered in the first hectic weeks 
of the reorganization process 
was a lack of teaching 
assistancts and an over· 
crowding of sections. 
Although the num~r of 
sections in French, German 
and Spanish Literature 10 
classes was doubled from two 
to four each, French 
overflowed with enough 
students for a fifth section. 

Lyon expects that this 
problem will be ironed out by 
next year. "After one year we 
will be able to predict almost 
precisely how many students 
we will have (for the 
quarter)," he says. 

Although TAs were needed 
to teach the added sections, 
funds to hire them were 
scarce, After some soliciting, 
m was riated 

from the Council of Provosts, 
and qualified persons were 
hired to teach sections. 
Additionally, rooms and 
books had to be found at the 
last minute to accomodate 
the new sections. 

As Lyons and others noted, 
much of the credit for the 
resolving of these difficulties 
goes to assistant professor 
Catherine Lowe, who Lyon 
says "turned herself inside 
::>ut" in dealing with each 
difficulty. She talked to 
students continually, 
restructured the program to 
fit changed conditions, and 
visited classes to gauge their 
effectiveness, he says. "The 
courses as they were 
originally conceived no 
longer met students needs," 
says Lowe, who only arrived 
at UCSD this year. 

Based on her work, the 
Literature sequences have 
been al tered to fi t new 
conditions. Literature 10 has 
now become . , 

review of grammar, Litera· 
ture 25 a combinatjon of 
grammar, composition, and 
discussion of short stories, 
and Literature 50 an analysis 
of the language's' literature. 
Under the new program, 
Lowe feels that "with very 
few exceptions, everybody 
was happy with the way 
things worked out." 

The catalyst for these 
changes came when the 
Progress Review Committee 
and Council of Provosts 
decided last year to reduce 
Linguistic T A funding. Skill 
acquisition courses -

. Languages 1-4 - are TA 
intensive, usually with a 15:1 
ratio. Since language levels 5 
and 6 had a relative 
"handful" of students due to 
many moving on to Litera-
ture after level 4, they could 
not be sustained without 
affecting the more basic 
courses, For that reason it 

decided to drop them 
turn to 12

Reagan: a metaphor of a deteriorating America 

Editor: 
With the coming of another . 

cold damr autumn, the 
citizens 0 America must · 
once again somberly consider 
the Presidential election. 
This season, however, the old 
adage that a nation gets the 
leaders that it deserves will 
not be true. Not even 
America, that insipid land of 
uninspired Troglodytes. 
deserves the wretched 
mmbination of incompetence 
and buffoonery that 
mmprises the selection of 
Presidential candidates. 

favorite, the San Francisco 
Chronicle - that sensational· 
ist, Hearst rag which carries 
on the finest traditions of 
America yellow journalism. 

The former Governor also 
has a healthy respect for 
other peoples' opinions . 
When anyone disagrees with 
his ideas, he has them fired . 
When the Governor didn't 
like Professor Marcuse's 
ideas, the old philosopher 
was forced by Ronny to 
retire; little matter that the 
professor had one of the 
greatest minds of the 
twentieth century. Not since 1933, when the 

German voters had to decide 
between Hindenburg (a fossil 
who at the time was even 
older than Reagan is now) 
and Adolf Hitler. has any 
electorate been faced with so 
grim a decision. 

One wonders whether the 
i"eatest of these three evils, 
!(eagan. is truly evil. Perhaps 
Ronny, with his rapidly 
deteriorating mind and body, 
is merely a metaphor of 
America. However, if one 
considers Hannah Arendt's 
presumption that evil is 
banal, then Reagan can 
certainly be considered evil 
because he is the avatar of 
ba!!.ality. 

- How can anyone vote for a 
man who is so senile or (and?) 
80 stupid as to say that the 
Klan was founded in 
AIabam .. ? Didn't he pause to 
consider that with such a 
statement he might very well 
have lost all the electoral 
votes of that state? 

lust think what a 
tmnendous historian Ronny 
would make. Why, with that 
fine analytical mind, he could 
make up a whole new field in 
the dlseipline: creative 
history. He would simply 
think up a thesis and then 
write up the supporting 
documents. 

Like Ronny says, some 
people find the facts that they 
are using and others simply 
make them up. Of murse 
when Reagan does bother to 
find the facts, he uses the 
very best sources, like his 

Ronald Reagan's political 
philosophy is in a way 
analagous to George Allen's 
sports ideology. Allen 
typically trades early draft 
round choices for established 
veterans. Thus, the future is 
sacrificed for the present. 

Similarly, Reagan sacri-
fices the future for political 
expediency. Under the 
Reagan administration, stat.e 
aid to education was cut on 
all levels. from the 
elementary school to the 
University of California. 

The niyopic Governor 
traded in the quality of 
education, the most impor-
tant aspect of human capital, 
so that he could cut taxes 
(and he still raised taxes 
several times during his 

. administration). He showed a 
callous disregard for future 
generations in dealing with 
the environmental issues. 

Ronny (if-rou've-see-one- .. 
Redwood-you ve-seen-them-
all) Reagan said, Quoting US 
government statistics. that 
we had enough coal for our 
energy needs for 200 years. 
What he did not say is that he 
w0l!ld mmpl~tely ruin the 
environment 10 the process. 

His jingoistic saber· 
rattling is also a threat to 
future gener~tions. Ap· 
parently , Reagan would 
think nothing of killing off a 
good proportion of America's 
}Toung men in a foriegn war. 
This total disregard for the 
future leads one to believe 

AS plans to picket

Select members 'Of the 
UCSD Associated Students

President David S. Saxon to

demands for campus 
visitations by the final 
candidates for Chancellor 
and disclosures of the criteria 
used in the selection process 
were not met. 

Furthermore, David 
Saxon, acting as spokes· 
person for the Search 
Committee, made it clear 
that the demands of the 
students were unimportant. 

that Ronny is 0 old and 0 
reactionary that he has no 
consciousne of the future .

unreali tic . He offers 
platitudes as solutions to

incredible inflation. The dark 
Dionysian appeals to "make 
America strong again" are 
similar to the aesthetic 
politics of Adolf Hitler. 

Which brings us back to 
the question of Reagan 's 
evilnes . His McCarthyite 
hysterics in front of the 
House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee in the 1950s 
certainly attest to the dark 
side of Reagan. But I think an 
even better illustration of his 
inhumanity was his expul-

One of Reagan's campaign 
aides, Don Blackwell, said 
recently that "He (Reagan) is 
human just like everybody 
else." Indeed, so was Hitler.

Immigration policy is given 
the short shrift by candidates 

BY ROBERT MIllIKEN 
With five million Mexicans entering the US 

illegally each y.ear and pr~jeftions of 
HispaOlcs becommg the nabon ,s lar~t 
minority in the near future, one might thmk 
that the issue of immigration would warrant 
some substantive, clear-cut proposals from 
this year's presidential contenders. 

Instead, voters are being offered ' 
ambigu~s statements about "guest worker" 
programs that failed in Europe five years ago, 
identification and classification procedures 
that have long drawn the wrath of human 
rights advocates, and implied thr~ts to crack 
down on US employers of illegal aliens. 

Ronald Reagan probably came closer than 
anyone to touching.t:he raw nerve of the issue 
when he issued calls in Texas for open 
borders between the US and Mexico and for 
allowing Mexican workers to enter the 
country "for whatever length of time they 
want to stay." 

That, at least, sounded like a policy - good 
or bad. -

But that wasn't what the former California 
governor really meant, said Ed Gray, 
Reagan's 'director of policy communication, 
who hastened to wrap Reagan 's statement in 
politically safe qualifi~,~tions. . 

Reagan, said Gray, IS not suggestmg any 
wholesale and massive kind of exodus across 
the border. The fact is, the status quo simply 
is not working and we should be more 
realistic about our policies of admitting for 
specific periods of time more people than now 
legally across the border." . 

from across the border. 
But the ~st worker idea is also stron~ly' 

opposecl tiy orner in .erest. groups whlctr-
Reagan is also courtlOg, mcludlng. many 
Mexican-Americans who fear for their own 
jobs, and blue-collar w~ite Y'orkers who 
oppose any increase of Hlspamcs because of 
presumed overloads on the welfare system. 

Thus Reagan is forced to delicately bala~ce 
his much-vaunted Friedmanesque economics 
of free trade against blue-collar fears of 
unbridled immigration. 

Spokesman Gray handles the act with 
aplomb: "We are not talki~g about the kinds 
of jobs that replace Amencans. That would 
not be acceptable. We are talking about people 
who want to come on a temporary basis to 
take jobs that go unfilled." 

As for those undocumented workers 
alrt>.ady here, Reagan would favor some sort of 
amnesty for workers who had demonstrB:t'ed 
"good citizenship" over a 10 to I~ year pe~lOd, 
said Gray. He would oppose heaVier sanctions 
on employers who s~nti~ue to, hire 
undocumented workers. It IS Impractical to 
try to put the burden of proof on an employer 
in deciding who is an illegal alien," said Gray. 

In any case, he added, . a Reagan 
administration would do nothmg on the 
immigration issue until it could review a 
report, due on . Ma r~h 1., 1981, ~y a select 
commission on ImmigratIOn appolOted three

students to join the picket. 
Please meet at the gym steps 
at 3:45j)Ol tomorrow, or call

Gray added that the Reagan "concept" is to 
admit Mexican workers for between three 
and six months as "guest workers" with 
work permits - a plan already proposed by

Gas prices-

LOS ANGELES - A 
leading oil industry analyst 
says results of a new survey 
show a steady decline in 
gasoline prices nationwide -

an indication that American 
consumers are having a 
bigger impact than the Iraq, 
Iran war on the US energy 
:.ituation. 

"J'm a little bit stunned," 
Dan Lundberg, publisher of 
the weekly Lundberg Letter, 
said yesterday 

He said the survey shows a 

decline in gas prices over the 
past month in each of the 26 
cit ies analyzed. 

And a recent management 
audit by Theodore Barry & 
Associates contended that 
Unit I, the reactor that 
escaped damage in the 
accident, must reopen if Met 
Ed is to avoid bankruptcy.

take their medicine." 

The label on the bottle may 

say thtee times a day. but 
which three time ? A k your 
doctor exactly when you 
s hould take 'a drug. If the 
an wer is "before meals, " 
how long before? Doe "with 
meals" mean immediately 
after you sit down, mid·way 
through or wit h desert? 
Never take any drug without 
checking possible side effects 
and reactions. 

The Food a nd Drug 
Administration also warns 
that certain food and drugs 
can be dangerous when taken 
together. "In general," say 

an FDA fact sheet, "it is 
unwise to take drugs with 
soda pop or acid fruit or 
vegetable juices unless you 
check with your doctor first. 
These beverages can result in 
excess acidity that may cause 
some dr ugs to dissolve 
quickly in t h e stomach 
instead of in t he intestines 
where they can be more 
readily ah!;orbed into the 
bloodstream ... 

Another com bination to 
avoid is tetracycli ne - an 
antibiotic - a nd dair y 
products.

Sopholnore places second 
in national \Valking lneet 

BY BARBARA HAAS 
POrlS Editor 

Kuro h Hojabri, a Revelle 
sophomore, is one of only a 
handful 0 competitive race 
walkers in San Diego. His 
regular work-outs in Balboa 
Park helped him to place 
second in the Junior Olympic 
National Competition thi 
summer in the 1500 meter 
race-walk event. 

Race walking as a 
competitive s port is 
unknown co mpared to 
runn ing. Although the sports 
appears similar to an average 
observer. they actually have 
little in common. Running 
com petition have been 
around since people dis· 
covered the use 'of legs, but 
competitive race walking just 
began in the early part of this 
century. 

Most people in the San 
Diego area are acquainted 
with the sport only if they 've 
seen athletes in Balboa Park 
training. The athletes are the 
object of many stares. as race 
walking isn't quite running 
but is certainly more 
advanced than a leisurely 
stroll. 

Hojabri arrived in the US 
from Germany two years ago. 
His father. a professor in the 
field of medicine, decided to 
bring his family here to spend 
his sabbatical. Hojabri 
enrolled in La Jolla High 
School as a senior, and- after 
graduation attended UCSD

- when he wa on ly 16year 
old. He chose to follow a rigid 
cour e a a bio·engineering 
major. but after he fini he 
thi s year he intends to return 
to Germany to finish school. 

He isn't overly fond of 
UCSD's curriculum , "r don 't 
really like it here," he said, 
"I'm not used to studying, 
a nd I really have to work to 
get good grades. I ha ve to stay 
here for two years so that 
when I go back to Germany I 
won't have to go back to high 
school a~ain . In Germany 
they don t care what school 
you go to. I could ha ve gone to 
Mesa College for two years 
and it would have been 
okay." 

He had no real motivation 
for choosing UCSD over 
other schools, but he does like 
the San Diego area. His 
father 's role with the medical 
school also affected his 
decision. 

Hojabri first started race 
walking when he was at a 
German high school in Iran 
three years ago. At a dual 
meet with an American 
school, he competed in a 
400m walk just to have 
something to do. He liked the 
sport immediately, but had 
few other opportunities for 
practice until coming to the 
US. 

At La Jolla High he 
competed in high hurdles 
because no race walking 
event existed on the track 

team, He was s till intere ted 
in the port. however, and 
last Augu t entered the 
district competition for the 
Junior OlympiCS in the 
summer after hi graduation. 
One other competitor showed 
up for the race. ' so both 
qualified for the regional '. 
Hojabri was the ingle 
entrant in regional competi , 
tion and thus proceeded 
easily to national competition 
in Nebraska, where he 
fini hedadi appointing190f 
23. 

Despite his low finish at 
Nebra ka, he decided to begin 
seriou training for race 
walking. The start of another 
sc hool year halted hi s 
endeavor, and he did not 
actually begin working out 
again until this summer. 

At the start of his training 
in Balboa Park this year, 
Hojabri met Dale Sutton and 
Ron Laird, both experienced 
race walkers (Laird is a four-
time Olympian) who taught 
him some techniques and 
gave him his firs t formal 
training. When mid·August 
and Jr, Olympic trials came 
around again, Hojabri 
entered with confidence and 
a goal to better his previou 
time of eight minutes in the 
1500 meter. 

Two primary rules govern 
the race walking events. 
Unbroken contact with the 
ground must be maintained

UCSD surf team wipes ou t 
USD and Pt. Lorna ·squads 

The surf team easily wOn 
its tri-meet Saturday. as 
Point Lorna College and the' 
University of San Diego each 
gained only 2B points to the 
Triton's 77, The competition 
was held at Ocean Beach. 
Mark Adams. a Triton stand· 
up board athlete, said "this 
_was probably our easiest 
match the whole year." 

UCSD took first place in 
seven of eight heats, losing 
one in the regulation stand-
up competition_ Dave Atkins, 
Norman Garcia, John Stenke. 
Hugh Minetree and Craig 
Schieber all took top honors 
in each of their six-man 
heats, In the women's 
division, Sandy Groos out· 
maneuvered the Torero and 
Cougar opposition to sweep 
fir t place. Bill Lerner took 
the kneeboard division. 

Points are distributed on 
the basis of an individual's 

Race walking 
continued from page 9 
(an infraction of this is called 
floating) and the leg must be 
completely straightened 
before the foot comes off the 
pavement . Race walking 
differs from running in that 
in running the feet and legs 
push the body forward. and 
In race walking different 
muscles are used to pull the 
body along the course. 

"Your legs can get really 
sore after you haven't been 
working out." said Hojabri. 
"Every time I start training 
again after I quit for a while I 
have to get used to it allover 
again." 

Hojabri's persistence with 
his trainings paid off well 
this summer. He advanced 
again to national competi-
tion, and placed a photo-
finish second behind the 
national champion. 

"Our times, they were the 
same." said Hojabri. "Hewas 
leaning forward just as I 
straightened to take a step, so 
he was ahead at the tape_ He 
got the first place. and I got 
second. SeCond's okay, I 
guess_" 

His time for the 1500 meter 
_I e,e~t jWJlS 6:26.? min~tes. 

~~ bettered hiS prevIous 
mark more and one and 

finish in the separate heats, 
Six points are awarded for 
first place. The number of 
points given each athlete 
decreases by one for each 
decreasing place in final 
standings, Two athletes from 
each team compete in the 
heats involving stand· up 
competition (regular surf-
ing)_ Three athletes are 
entered in both the women's 

and kneeboard divisions. 
"The surf was two to four 

feet in fair condition," said 
Adams. "The weather was 
miserabte, as anyone knows 
who's been out the past three 
weeks." 

The team travels to 
Newport Beach n ex t

contest. 

Spikers beat Point Loma 
BY SAMANTHA ROBY 

In an exhibition of athletic prowess, the women's volleyball 
team swept a Tuesday night home match aga!nst Pt. Lorna 
College 15-4. 15-13. 15-6, This victory kept the Tritons still 
undefeated in league play. 

Although the Tritons' general game strategy is based on 
team effort. two of the players gave exceptional individual 
performances. Lulu Schwartz played an outstanding game at 
setter. and outside hitter Sherre Lilley put out several 
impressive net plays. 

Point Loma isn't traditionally a strong team. so the win 
came as no shock. 

The Tritons took the first game effortlessly. In the second 
game. they were down 11·3 due to some careless passing and 
general lack of concentration, 

Doug Dannevik. coach of the squad said. "The team was 
able to come back because of their confidence in themselves as 
players. They built up their concentration and passed the ball 
well in the second half of the game," After the Tritons had 
regrouped . they allowed Point Lorna only two points and went 
on to win the game 15-13. 

The third game was even easier than the first, 
"We got ahead early 6-2 and just kept the pressure on, "said

Pope praises 
'self-control' 

VA TICAN CITY - Pope 
John Paul II celebrated a 
special Ma for all the 
world 's families yesterday 
and praised couples who 
practice sexual "self-
control. " 

Engaged and married 
couples from all over the 
world made personal 
statements about the joys 
and problems of their 
relationship during cere-
monies to highlight a current 
meeting of bishops to discuss 
birth control. divorce and 
other family i ue. 

"In the midst of so many 
voices in our permi s ive 
ociet y that exalt so-called 

sexual liberty as a part of 
human fulfillment , it s right 
for those to raise their voice 
who. in their day-to-day 
experience of a serene and 
generous self-control, have 
been able to discover a new 
source of reciprocal acquaint-
ance. deeper understanding 
and authentic liberty." the 
60-year-old pontiff said. 

Earlier, at an outdoor 
Mass, the pope emphasized 
the religious side of love and 
marriage after drawing 
criticism for saying four days 
ago that a man should not feel 
excessive sexual desire even 
for his wife.

Financial aid is adequate 
at UCSD; not so elsewhere 

BY JANE GILBERT 
A greater number of UCSD 

students are receiving some 
type of financial assistance 
says campus Deputy Director 
of Student Financial Services 
Fred Hessinger. 

"The UCSD Student 
Financial Services Office is 
able to provide adequate 
funding for all qualified 
needy students. Not all 
colleges and universities can 
make that claim," Hessinger 
sa~s. 

The marked increase in 
funding results from the 
establishment of more liberal 
guidelines which allow a 
greater number of students 
to qualify for financial aids he 
says. With the passage of the 

New Higher Education Bill 
did not provide adequate aids 
to meet their finanacial 
needs. 

Currently-, about 40 
percent of the students at 
UCSD receive some type of 
financial aid, and perhaps 75 
percent of the student 
population here will use 
UCSD's financial aid serives 
last week, more resources are 
available to all students, 
Hessinger says, especially 
those in the middle income 
bracket. 

The new bill was passed in 
response to increasing 
pressure from parents and 
students who felt that the 
Middle Income Assistance 
Act, passed several years ago, 

in applying for guaranteed 
bank loans, veterans services 
and work study programs. 

Between $22·25 million 
will be given to students for 
financial aid this year in the 
UC system, Hessinger 
estimates. The system 
receives more federal dollars 
than many other institutions 
of similar size. "Better 

~rained staffs" which are 
more skilled in soliciting 
financial aid funds generate 
more money for the UC 
system, Hessinger says. 

The UCSD Financial Aid 
Service program operate on 
a budget composed of stat~, 
federal, private and system· 
wide funding.

Language program ch.anges 
continued from page 1 
from the list of course 
offerings. 

Ironically, according to 
Linguistics Department 
Chairman Leonard New· 
mark funding levels are 
much the same as last year's 
after all. Every year when 
allocations are made, 
departments are told that 
that will be all the money 
alloted. And each year more 
money is actually give~ tha.n 
expected . But plannmg IS 
necessitated on a "wor t· 
case" basis, he say, so the 
course had to be cut for 

afety. 
Linguistic also took the 

opportunity to reorganize 
their program ub tantially. 
A Newmark outlined it, in 
the pa t languag cia se 
were in two-hour block , 
with two separat objective 
taught. 

The fir t part dealt with 
conversational abilities, 
taught in tutorial sections by 
graduate tudents. The 
second half of the clas dealt 
with analysis, taught in 
conferences by graduate 
students in Linguistics. 

The major complaint by 
student about the old 
system, was that only the 
grade was given for the two· 
part course. Thus a student 
could have achieved an "A" 
in conversational ability, a 
"C" in analy i , and end with 
an averaged grade of "B". In 
order to accurately portray 
their trengths and weak-
nes e, many tudent 
preferred epa rate grades on 
their tran cript . 

Now the Lingui stic Dept. 
i organized to better 
ac omodate tudent' 
wi he , Lowe ay . Level 1 
through 4 in language have 

been divided into two classes. 
As an example, French 1 is 
now French 31 (conversation) 
and French 51 (analysis). 
Both classe mu t be taken 
concurrently, but are on 
different days . Thi 
separates the two compo· 
nents into normal 50 minute 
time block , with individual 
grade for each. 

As Newmark tre ed, the 
department 's goal is to 
prepare tudent s for 
Literature cour s e : he 
doe n't believe in learning a 
language purely for the ake 
of doing so. "It' unu ual in 
that mo t department try to 
attract tudent. - here we 
are giving stud nt away," 
he commented . 

Lowe admit that r fine· 
rr ..:nts in Literature mU. t 
till be mad , and thet "onl 

way to do that i 0 -g t 
f dback from the stud nt s."
