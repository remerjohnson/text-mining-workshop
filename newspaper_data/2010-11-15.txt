Calling upon the spirit of protests past, students from 
the UC campuses have declared Nov. 16 to be the UC 
Unity Day of Action against a proposed 8-percent tuition 
increase. 

Students from various UC campuses will unite at the 
UC Board of Regents meeting held from Nov. 16 and 18 to 
lobby against the fee increases proposed in UC President 
Mark G. Yudof ’s Nov. 8 open letter to California. If  passed, 
the fees will go into effect during  the 2011-12 school year. 

Nov. 16 marks the start of a three-day meeting for the 
UC Board of Regents held at UC San Francisco, where offi-
cials will propose actions such as decreasing pensions and 
raising fees to stabilize the UC budget deficit.  According 
to A.S. Vice President of External Affairs Michael Lam, the 
board will vote on the 8-percent fee hikes on Nov. 18, the 
last day of the meeting.  

Delegations of students from various UC campuses  —
mainly those geographically closer to UCSF — will travel 
to the Regents meeting on Nov. 17 and 18 to lobby and 
protest against the fee hike. 

Lam said that there is not a delegation representing 
UCSD students going to UCSF.

“We are not sending a delegation because that Thursday 
— the Thursday when the fee hike will be proposed and 
voted on — is Founders’ Day here at UCSD,” Lam said. 
“The administration that we want to reach will be here 
at UCSD.”

Distance and unfamiliarity with the UCSF campus also 
made traveling to lobby unlikely. 

“Last year the Regents’ meeting was at UCLA,” Lam 
said. “This year it’s at UCSF, a graduate school that is much 
farther away and much less accessible.”

He added that the A.S. External Affairs office plans 
to broadcast the Regents meeting live on Thursday on 
Library Walk so students can hear the proposal for the 
fee hike.  

“We will broadcast the proposal to inform the students 
about the fee increase, “ Lam said. “We do stand in solidar-
ity with the other UC campuses that are going.” 

UC Berkeley and UC Davis are two of the campuses that 
will send students to UCSF to lobby against the fee hikes. 

The 8-percent increase will occur on top of the 32-per-
cent increase that passed during the Regents’ meeting last 
November.  

If implemented, tuition and student fees will increase 
by $822 next year, resulting in a total annual fee of $12,150.  

After the meeting next week, the Regents will meet 
on the UCSD campus from Jan. 18 to Jan. 20. Since more 
people will be informed about the fee hikes by then, Lam 
said that A.S. External Affairs office is planning a rally. 

“The fee hikes will most likely pass [this November],” 
said Lam.  “ We are planning something big for when the 
UC Board of Regents comes down here [for there next 
meeting].”

Day of Action Called to Protest Fee Increase

By Justin Kauker
Staff Writer

The California State University system 
announced that it will raise tuition fees by 
15 percent next year to sustain enrollment, 
classes and services for current students. 
This decision comes on the heels of an 
8-percent UC fee increase proposed by UC 
President Mark G. Yudof on Nov. 8. 

In a statement released last Wednesday, 

Nov. 10, the CSU Board of Trustees voted 
to charge an additional 5 percent — or 
$105 — for the spring semester for full-time 
undergraduate students, who currently pay 
$2,115 per semester. In addition, a 10-per-
cent increase, which is $444, will go into 
effect for the 2011-12 academic year. 

Students will pay an estimated $549 
more for classes by Fall 2011, and tuition 
will rise from $4,440 to $4,884 a year. 

According to the Board of Trustees, this 
mid-year tuition increase will allow the 
CSU system to add about 3,000 courses for 
winter and spring 2011. The course number 
is expected to double next academic year.

OFF CAMPUS                    ANGELA CHEN
The penultimate installment of the epic fantasy saga hits theaters 
this Friday (look for our film review on Nov. 18) and for that, you 
definitely need the best seats in the house. Watching the magical trio 
— Harry, Ron and Hermione — hunt for Horcruxes just wouldn’t 
be the same in a tiny theatre, sans IMAX. Luckily, Edwards Mira 
Mesa — located 21 minutes from campus — has a massive, magic-
worthy screen and plush seating to keep you comfortable throughout 
the midnight premiere. Not a diehard? Only 17 minutes away from 
UCSD is Fashion Valley mall, with a wide selection of goodies to 
snack on. Post show, head outside the theatre and indulge in a wide 
selection of after-movie shopping to work through your frustration 
at having to wait six months for the last installment (Louis Vuitton 
for those looking to spend, and H&M for students on a tighter bud-
get). If popcorn and Dibs just made you work up an appetite, step 
outside for restaurant-favorites like The Cheesecake Factory, which 
is open late.

First Human Cellular Model Created to Test Autism Drugs
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Regina Ip
Associate News Editor

Scientists are now using stem cells 
to study autism, instead of the old prac-
tice of studying psychological condi-
tions using mice. This new human cel-
lular model could be used to diagnose, 
drug screen and treat autism. 

“We always wanted to understand 
psychiatric disorders such as autism, 
but it’s hard because we have two 
options,” pediatrics assistant profes-
sor Alysson R. Muotri said. “One is 
to go for a mouse model, but [it’s] 
limited, especially in cases such as 
autism where there’s impaired social 
communication so animals don’t talk 
[and] they don’t have human language 
so it’s hard to do this study on animal 
models.”

Muotri said another way to analyze 
the effects of autism was by using brain 
tissue from someone who has died.

“However, when you have a post-
mortem brain, the damage is already 
there so you don’t understand how 
you get the disease because you have 

the endpoint,” Muotri said.
The stem cells came from con-

nective skin tissue cells called fibro-
blasts in adult patients who had Rett 
syndrome. Rett syndrome is a severe 
neurodevelopment disorder similar to 
autism where motor functions and 
social skills are impaired.

The researchers worked with Salk 
Institute for Biological Studies and 
Pennsylvania State University to trans-
form the cells into embryonic stem 
cells — specifically, induced pluripo-
tent stem cells, which can artificially 
generate into different cell types — to 
turn them into neurons, which are 
signaling cells in the nervous system.

The neurons made up an autistic 
neuron model that researchers used to 
test drugs and therapies to study how 
they affect autism.

“The dream was to have a very 
naïve cell that you can drive the cells 
to become neurons and to express the 
autistic features,” Muotri said. “One 
way to do that is to use human embry-
onic stem cells.”

The researchers then saw symp-

toms of Rett syndrome in abnormal 
neurons — which were smaller than 
healthy ones, had fewer synapses and 
had communication failures. These 
are similar to the effects observed in 
mouse models.

Scientists then used the drugs used 
in mice to treat signs of autism and 
found that the abnormalities in the 
neurons were reversed.

“Because we can see the difference, 
then we can use a drug treatment to 
see if we can reverse the autistic phe-
notype back to normal,” Muotri said. 
“We did that using two different drugs 
[which] made the autistic cells grow 
into normal ones. 

Muotri said one of the drugs he 
tested was in clinical trials for Rett 
syndrome and was only tested on 
mouse models. The other drug target-
ed a mutation associated with autism.

Since the researchers could see the 
reversal effects of the drug, they found 
that autism does not remain in a per-
manent state.

“This will indicate the cells were not 
frozen in this autistic state but they can 

be reverted back to normal,” Muotri 
said. “That points to a future drug 
screening platform where [one can test] 
thousands at the same time and will 
find one that’s very specific [and] very 
suitable for this conversion.”

Currently, the research group is 
using their autistic neuron model to 
screen more specific drugs to target 
neurons of people with autism.

NEWSÊ MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

President Grant Mack said that although stu-
dents are upset at the increase, it hasn’t caused 
much public outcry.

“Everyone feels helpless,” Mack said. “What 
are we going to do? The state just says ‘Here’s 
how much money CSU gets. Figure it out.”

Approximately 180,000 students — which 
makes up half of undergraduates at the 23-cam-
pus system — will be covered by financial aid. 
About one third of revenue from the tuition 
increase will be set aside for financial aid in the 
form of State University grants, Cal Grants and 
fee waivers.

Students who are not fully covered by finan-
cial aid can use expanded federal tax cred-
its, which are available for those with family 
incomes of up to $180,000.

“Students are really getting less for more,” 
CSU’s Executive Vice Chancellor of Business 
and Finance Benjamin Quillian said in a state-
ment. “But these are hard times for California. 
While we appreciate the funding that we did 
receive in this year’s budget, the reality is our 
state support is roughly the same as it was five 
years ago and we have 25,000 more students.” 

In January, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
proposed state budget for 2010-11 assumed a 
10-percent increase in CSU tuition. In June, the 
CSU trustees adopted a 5-percent increase since 
they could not fund the remaining 5 percent.  

Despite an approved October budget that 
restored $105 million in one-time federal stim-
ulus funds, the CSU system is still about $64 
million short.

The CSU system froze admission last year 
for spring applicants and,  when comparing 
admissions figures for the CSU and UC systems 

between 2008 and 2009, CSU lost 3,954 students 
while UC gained 5,813. But the CSU system 
still enrolls more students overall. Last year, the 
system enrolled 433,054 students at all of their 
campuses, more than double the amount of reg-
istered students in the UC system. 

Though UC tuition is still more expensive 
than CSU tuition, CSU costs have nearly tripled 
since 2002; in these past eight years CSU fees  
remained consistent only in 2007. In the state-
ment, CSU representatives said they are already 
planning to raise fees again next year. 

UC Office of the 
President spokesperson 
Lynn Tierney said she 
doesn’t think differences 
in UC and CSU tuitions 
will affect new applicants.

“It isn’t money that 
makes you decide on a 
school,” Tierney said. 
“It’s based on the career 
you want. Students don’t 
choose a school based on 
how much it costs.”

Mack disagreed.
“I like SDSU a lot, but 

one of the primary rea-
sons I decided to go here 
was because it’s cheaper,” 
he said.

CSU officials said that 
if the governor approves 

adequate funding for the next budget, they will 
rescind the tuition increase.

Naps in Class 
Aren’t Just for
First Graders
In retrospect, maybe signing up for that 8 a.m. upper-div biol-ogy lecture wasn’t the brightest 
idea — sure, it seemed doable at the 
beginning of the year, but after a 
month or two of all-nighters and your 
professor’s frequent rants about which 
scientist really developed the Keeling 
Curve, it becomes impossible to fight 
your drooping eyelids. You know that 
the healing powers of a five-minute 
cat nap will keep you from glaring 
down every well-rested student you 
encounter during the day, but taking 
it outside and away from the suspi-
cious eyes of the professor makes 
you every bit as awkward as that girl 
you saw last Friday, dead asleep in a 
corner booth at Round Table with a 
still-warm bread stick in her hands. 
Don’t worry: The How-to Guru is 

here to help you master the fine art of 
napping during class.

To pull off an inconspicuous 
classroom nap, an open laptop or 
large textbook is your first line of 
defense. Dim the brightness set-
ting on your makeshift barricade to 
maximize your chemistry formula-
infused dreams.

And remember: Lean forward. 
Leaning backwards ends in a gently 
snoring, mouth-agape posture that 
signals the professor that you’re not 
just daydreaming — you’re complete-
ly passed out. Tilt your head forward, 
brace your elbows on the desk, and 
rest your chin on your hand; you’re 
now a “Thinker”-inspired college 
student apparently engrossed in the 
stages of mitosis and ready to catch 
up on some Z’s. The hand strategy is 
especially choice if you’re a known 
drooler. Your gobs of drool will no 
longer be hanging off your chin like 
drippy stalactites, but will instead 
be contained in one central location 
(your palm).

 Another option is to turn to 
the greatest built-in pillow a college 
lecture hall has to offer: the wall. Be 
careful: You have no way of knowing 
what sort of infestations have under-
gone the head-to-wall transfer. But 
if your neighbor is cramping your 
style (and space), and your drooping 
eyelids are winning out over your 
need-to-know about the Krebs Cycle, 
pull up your hood, relax and lean. 
Beggars can’t be choosers.

Sometimes, you’re lucky enough 
to have signed up for a class with 
a friend or two — use this to your 
advantage. Sandwich yourself 
between trustworthy lookouts who’ll 
warn you when your snoring is reach-
ing critical volume and won’t mind if 
you use their shoulder as a headrest. 
Make sure they don’t fall asleep as 
well, though — nothing gives away 
your in-class slumber as easily as a 
row of gently lolling heads. 

Above all, vigilance is of the utmost 
importance. This separates the ama-
teur nappers (who are oblivious to 
threats like earthquakes, fires and irate 
professors) from the pros (who use 
their freaky sixth sense to sound the 
alarm before danger strikes).

Regardless of whether you are 
a dedicated slacker or a straight-A 
student, sometimes — despite those 
four shots of espresso — last night’s 
rager catches up with you mid-lec-
ture. There’s no shame in it. We’ve all 
been there. But at least you’ll be able 
to sleep a little sounder with How-to 
Guru on your side.

Paying for Grades is More Complicated than A, B, C
PERFORMANCE-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS ARE WELL-INTENTIONED, BUT SCHOOLS 

NEED TO BE WARY OF MOTIVATING STUDENTS FOR THE WRONG REASONS. 
BY MADELINE MANN 

QUICKTAKES

Four Loko became a public health issue when 
it began consistently putting Americans in hospi-
tals and the government is obligated to take action 
against it. College students are notorious for sub-
jecting themselves to high levels of alcohol (read: 
“Animal House”), and according to a Columbia 
University study, the mix of alcohol and caffeine 
is more dangerous than alcohol alone because the 
“caffeine’s stimulating effect can make people less 
aware of the effects of alcohol” — which can cause 
them make decisions they might not otherwise risk. 

When people started abusing cocaine in the 
early 1900s, we banned it. When people started 
abusing meth, we banned it. So we shouldn’t be 
surprised or horrified that, after 23 New Jersey stu-
dents and nine Washington students were rushed 
to the hospital because of Four Loko, several state 
governments passed legislation to protect their 
constituents. It’s too easy to paint Michigan and 
Washington’s bans as unfair or ineffective. While 
individuals are responsible for their actions, if 
people are getting hurt because they can’t con-
duct themselves responsibly, it’s the government’s 
obligation to step in — even if that means passing 
unpopular legislation.

Four Loko is dangerous if not taken in mod-
eration, and if people aren’t informed enough to 
moderate themselves, we should be grateful that our 
government is looking out.

Alcoholic Energy Drink Ban

Michigan and Washington have banned Four 
Loko, claiming that it is a serious health risk to the 
American youth. According to the FDA, the $3 price 
tag on each can of liquid shitshow makes it a dan-
gerously cheap bargain for a deceptively powerful 
beverage. Nine college students in Washington and 
23 in New Jersey have been hospitalized for alcohol 
poisoning after a night with Four Loko — some 
mistakenly believed that the caffeine “counteracts” 
the alcohol, and others simply didn’t realize that two 
of those 20-proof candy-sweet drinks contain more 
alcohol than a six-pack of beer. But while it’s true 
that Four Loko is dangerous in excess, banning Four 
Loko is incredibly ineffective.

With this legislation, Michigan misses the core 
danger behind drinking Four Loko: the health 
risks of mixing energy drinks with alcohol. When 
the state targeted Four Loko, it did not ban simi-
lar drinks like Joose, which is a 24-proof option 
that also contains caffeine. Additionally, alcohol is 
already accessible to Four Loko’s drinkers, law or 
no, so it’s still impossible to stop college students 
from mixing up a homemade version of Four Loko, 
like Redbull with vodka (appropriately named the 
“Vod-Bomb”) or good ol’ Irish coffee. Though the 
Michigan government’s wish to protect its young 
constituents is admirable, this ineffective ban does 
little to reduce risks, removing only a name brand 
and leaving the product untouched.

— Bridgétt Rangel-Rexford
Staff Writer

Michigan and Washington have passed bans 
outlawing the Jolly-Rancher flavored energy drink, 
Four Loko. Don’t be fooled by its kid flavors — its 
12-percent alcohol (combined with a hefty dose of 
caffeine) packs the punch of five light beers and a cup 
of coffee. It can be more dangerous than hard liquor, 
because college students underestimate the amount it 
takes to get life-threateningly drunk. But the problem 
is that these poor decisions are made by students 
looking to let loose for cheap, and a ban won’t teach 
self restraint.

It seems that the states’ legislation aims to protect 
young drinkers from the dangers of a beverage that 
has a stronger effect than kids suspect. The problem 
is that if we outlawed everything college students use 
to make stupid and hazardous decisions, there would 
be no end to the list of banned substances.

Meanwhile, the list of legal things that can kill you 
— from cigarettes to Big Macs — rely on consumer 
responsibility. If the individual doesn’t moderate his 
or her usage, the personal consequences are severe. 
Banning every potential danger, however, will cre-
ate superfluous laws that diminish the value of the 
important ones.  Instead, the state should focus on 
education (work with the FDA, for example, to dis-
play prominent warning labels). College students 
may be low on common sense sometimes, but part of 
growing up is taking responsibility for your actions, 
rather than having the state baby you.

When all else fails, the parents of some lucky kids turn to an allow-ance boost in exchange for good 
grades — we all hated the middle-school 
delinquent who raked in $20 for every “B” on 
his report card. But bribing your student isn’t 
just for desperate parents anymore: The state 
of Ohio decided to take a page out of desper-
ate parents’ books in hopes of increasing per-
formance at its community colleges.

Starting next year, Ohio’s state legislature 
will select three community colleges to test a 
program that gives performance-based schol-
arships to low-income student-parents at the 
school — an effective plan in theory, given 
that money is a powerful motivator. But the 
standards for reward money are so low they’re 
less “performance based” and more based on 
whether or not the student showed up. 

The high “performance” standards man-
dated are that the scholarship students main-
tain a “C” average while taking 12 or more 

units; similar programs are in the works 
for community colleges in California, New 
Mexico and New York. While the scholar-
ships might be well-intentioned, they’re 
spoiling the students with short-term gain 
and rewarding them for standards that show 
no exemplary work.

Ohio used Louisiana as its model in 
the state’s attempt to spend the welfare 
surplus (the unallocated funding for the 
state’s welfare projects). Almost a decade 
ago, Louisiana started a performance-based 
scholarship program from its own surplus 
money. The state legislature found the pro-
gram “promising,” but 10 years later, there are 
no statistically significant improvements in 
graduation rates.

Ohio’s scholarships give up to $1,800 a 
year to those students that earn at least a 
“C” in 12 credits — a grant that covers most 
of the average $2,076 community college 
tuition. But the students receive no bonus 

for the extra effort of achieving higher than 
a “C” because the goal of the program is to 
motivate students to improve, and then get 
them out the door as quickly as possible. But 
without a tiered system of reward, the incen-
tive only motivates students to scrape by with 
a passing grade. If the schools really wanted 
a motivational scholarship, they should set 
the standard higher than just “average,” and 
reward different levels of performance.

Additionally, the 12-credit requirement 
could hurt the quality of education students 
receive, since the terms of the grant encour-
age students to take more classes that require 
minimal effort. And 12 credits is the bare 
minimum to begin with. A study by the New 
York-based non-profit research organization 
MRDC showed that, on average, students in 
the experimental scholarship group didn’t 
earn even one credit more than those in the 
control group.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
After entering UCSD as freshman 

about a month ago, it has come to 
my senses that there are a lot of bik-
ers (bicycles, not motorbikes) around 
here. Given the fact that, when com-
pared to other universities, UCSD is 
exceptionally large (literally, of course) 
and there aren’t many hills that block 
the easy access to riding bikes, I, just 
like many others, have become an avid 
bike lover at this university.

However, when compared to the 
number of bike lovers, it seems to me 
that UCSD could afford more space 
for riding bicycles. I have frequently 
witnessed that there aren’t enough 
biking spaces in front of res-life halls 
and buildings in which popular 
classes are taken, and some bike lanes 
are somewhat far from university 
buildings, making students bump 
uncomfortably on the stairs while rid-
ing bikes from one place to another. 
Given that riding bikes is, without any 
doubt, way better than driving cars 
when compared in an environment-
friendly view, and given that there 
are numerous bike lovers at UCSD, 
I would like to suggest that UCSD 
could also become a bike-friendlier 
place than the current state. With a 
small effort and dedication, UCSD 
could become a better place for both 
saving the environment and those 
who use bikes more than walking on 
foot to commute inside and around.

Dear Editor,
Food at this school is incredibly 

overpriced.  Just a few weeks ago, I 
spent almost six of my dining dollars 
on a hot dog, which was not of very 
high quality. 

I can get a bigger (and better) hot 
dog at Costco for only two dollars, 
and it comes with a drink. Costco, of 
course, does not accept dining dollars, 
so I am forced to purchase my inferior 
dinner at the dining halls. 

If this school would adjust the 
price of food, I would save at least 
three dollars a day. That means $21 per 
week, over $200 per quarter, and $600 
in a year. The $600 I could save on 
food could be used to purchase other 
things, such as a parking permit for the 
year, study guides for textbooks, extra 
walking shoes, or to open up a bank 
account. 

In sum, since dining dollars are 
forced upon me, I would prefer bet-
ter quality food, or at least food that is 
priced adequately.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre

Despite its high rewards — and due 
to its low standards — this program is 
hardly making a dif-
ference.These scholar-
ships are encouraging 
students to take the 
easy way out. If a stu-
dent needs to make 
C’s to pay the rent, 
then he’ll be driven to 
enroll in less challeng-
ing courses just for 
the cash. This makes 
students less ambitious toward taking 
challenging classes that will ultimately 
be more beneficial.

Instead of pulling out the check-
book every time a student comes along 
with a “C” average, colleges could 
raise the GPA threshold for monetary 

reward, encouraging them to continue 
improving. For the students who no 
longer receive an award for their 2.0 

GPA, the left-
over money 
could go toward 
something 
that directly 
improves the 
quality of 
higher educa-
tion, such as 
additional 
tutoring pro-

grams for low-income students. That 
way, the state can work towards its goal 
of improving grades and all students 
will benefit from the funds — not just 
those that make the grade.

In the long run, this form of 
extrinsic motivation will not help 

students perform better. And once 
the money stops flowing from Ohio’s 
welfare surplus, students may be less 
motivated to maintain their grades. 
The best thing that can be done for 
these students is to instill in them a 
desire for life-long learning through 
quality education, and to educate 
them on the long-term benefits of 
doing well in college. While we all 
wish we could clock in the hours we 
spend studying for our midterms, 
this new system would spoil us and 
encourage learning only as much as 
we need to get by. Honest, hard work 
is a critical expectation for getting 
into college; that shouldn’t change 
once you’re there.

Readers can contact Madeline Mann 
at memann@ucsd.edu.

The leftover money 
could go toward
something that directly 
improves the quality of 
higher education.

As those who make the weekly trek from Warren College 
to HSS know, UCSD is built on a lot of hilly land — 
which makes it prime longboarding territory. The 
paths and inclines that make walking from one part 
of campus to another a hassle for normal people are 
a blessing for those on urethane wheels. 
For those looking for one of the most exhilarat-
ing rides on campus (and are feeling a bit daring), 
check out the hill on Voigt Drive that dips down past 
Hopkins Parking Structure into Warren Canyon. It’s 
arguably the steepest hill on campus, and you’re treated 
to a view of Geisel Library and glimpses of the startled Warren 
rabbits as you speed by. Just be sure to keep an eye out for oncoming 
traffic and the cops (who don’t need an excuse to write you a ticket).

It may have hijacked its logo from “The

make Muir Woods’s offerings any less bomb. 

Forget Cinnabon — to get your gooey and sugary

find this shop nestled between Pines and Half Dome. 
Once there, throw down $1.50 for the chance to stuff 

your face with a warm, flaky, fresh-baked pastry, topped with 
sweet brown sugar. But you better get there early — since they 

only make a finite amount each morning, the early bird gets the worm 
(or cinnamon roll) and once they’re gone, you’ll have t o 

wait until tomorrow for a second chance.  When you need 
a late- night sugar fix, don’t worry about trekking off campus; 
instead, grab your flip flops and make your way to this sugary puff-pastry paradise 
that isn’t too bad at making cookies, muffins and scones, either.

First dates are exciting, nerve-racking and the setting you choose 
can make or break the night. Ice skating at UTC shopping mall’s 
Ice Town, located a scant seven minutes away from campus and 
open every day of the week, is your best bet for breaking the ice 
(pun intended). Rink time only costs $11, and skate rentals are 
an additional $2. Most SoCal kids haven’t done much ice skating, 
which will work in your favor — if your date isn’t very good at 
it, you can Michelle Kwan it up and down the rink and help your 
partner find his/her balance. If the ice is getting the better of your 
balance too, you can both have fun stumbling all over the place 

(and, coincidentally, holding hands to keep yourselves upright). 
There are more opportunities to chat than at the movies, you get 

points for creativity and you can avoid the 
formal pressures of a sit-down dinner.

Hidden in an ill-lit corner on the bottom floor of the UCSD Bookstore is Perks, the best coffee shop on 
campus to turn to when you are desperately craving that extra hot nonfat half-caf hazelnut latte with a 
double shot of espresso. 

All of Perks’s teas and coffees are both organic and fair trade, and — with 
four coffee blends daily, three types of hot chocolate and eight flavored syr-
ups (French vanilla, caramel, raspberry, peppermint, Irish creme, hazelnut, 
almond and chocolate) — there is something here to satisfy every craving. 

Prices can get steep as specifications pile up ($1 for every added espresso shot and $0.50 for extra flavoring) but 
a standard small white chocolate mocha will set you back only about three bucks. For $1 off cappuccinos, cubanos, 
café cacao and spicy maya hot chocolate, go on Wednesdays between 2 and 4 p.m. 

As for finding the place, don’t worry— navigating through Imprints’s rows of copiers and the bookstore’s entire fic-

There is one experience that is the bane of a vegan’s existence, guaranteed to inspire

Sipz in Clairemont 
Mesa, a 12-minute 
drive from UCSD, is a 
place vegans and non-vegans 
alike can enjoy. Everything is strictly 

vegetarian and nearly every item on the menu is vegan, though a few have cheese or mayo. Sipz has mastered the 
art of disguising soy protein, and even the most seasoned carnivores are unable to distinguish it from real meat. 
Traditional dishes such as orange “chicken” and “beef” and broccoli, priced at $7.95 each, are fan favorites, 
but mock meats are by no means needed for a good meal. For dessert, their Thai sweet rice with mango 
is a perfect mix of tanginess and sugary rice milk. With great prices to match, Sipz is the best place to

All good bathrooms have one thing in common: No one goes to them. UCSD’s best pisspots aren’t the centrally located, 
high-traffic rooms in PC, but the out-of-the-way toilets in Warren and the Old Student Center.

Girls can’t do better than the restroom on the second floor of the Engineering Building Unit 3 (EBU3), located 
in Warren's School of Engineering. It’s spotless, well-stocked and usually empty — which speaks volumes about the 
number of female engineers. It even sports a clever environmentally friendly dryer you put your hands into (instead 
of under). For the boys, the bathroom on the first floor of the Old Student Center (next to the bike shop) is always 
open, always available and always clean. Its motion-activated light sensors might make the pitch-dark interior daunting 
on first glance, but wait a split second and marvel at the amount of excess space. It's almost like peeing in the comfort 

and privacy of your own home. But bigger and cleaner.

of the PC West ballrooms, over the bookstore 
entrance. It’s relatively quiet, if you’re not count-

subdued anyway). The bathrooms are close by, and there’s food downstairs for when the just-woke-up munchies hit. 
If all the couches are taken, no worries — grab two chairs and push them together to make a crib. It’s much more

absurdly large variety of American, European and Mexican breakfast 
dishes that are probably too expensive for you to eat when mom and 
dad aren’t paying. Their coffee is fantastic, the atmosphere is serene 
and the bathrooms are never too far away.  The restaurant is only 
a couple of blocks away from La Jolla Cove, so you can take 
your parents for a walk once you’ve recovered a bit. Be sure 
to try the French toast (complete with powdered sugar and 
blueberry purée) — it’s probably the best you’ll ever have, 
regardless of how badly your head hurts.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIANÊ MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2010Ê FOCUS

OFF CAMPUS           ÑREN EBEL

Holden Caulfield, thrift stores, skinny jeans — all of the 
things we hipsters once held dear are becoming popular, 

and worthless. It’s time to bring out the big guns. 
The Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla 
is a gold mine of sculptures and paintings 

that can really only be described as avant-
garde.  Just walking in the door makes you 

feel like a part of the effortlessly cool, 
independent counterculture. But make 

sure to plan out how you’ll translate 
your thoughts into insightful criti-
cism. Here are a couple to get you 
started: The noncommittal “This 
has lots of colors” becomes “I 
really like the narrative here,” 
while “Does this represent 
something?” turns into “This 
represents the war in Iraq.”

If all else fails, just stare 
intently at the art, nodding your 

head in agreement as if it were 
giving you directions to the nearest 

vegan shoe store.
Living off the grid? No problem. If 

you’re under 25, admission is free. So pre-
pare yourself for an outing as rich and intel-

lectually satisfying as a cup of fair trade double 
espresso from the museum cafe (because Starbucks 

just never gets it right).

The Social Sciences Building rests 
between RIMAC and Goody’s, 
though most people only run 
through there long enough 
to turn in a couple of MMW 
papers. Free from prying eyes, it 
makes for a “Footloose”-inspired 
rage dance tribute to Kevin 
Bacon himself. The view from the 
fourth floor is beautiful at night, 
(at least, it’s about as amazing as it 
can get for an on-campus student). 
The John Hopkins structure glows a soft 
and phosphorescent yellow, and in the distance, 
the La Jolla city skyline seems to glitter as the lights from the buildings flicker 
on and off. It’s the perfect place for a conversation to let your anger out, or for 
giving you a break from noisy suitemates and tedious reading assignments.

OFF CAMPUS                ÑMICHELLE ZHOU
Across the street from Stonehenge and the La Jolla Playhouse 
area is Torrey Pines Road, a windy street that leads to down-
town La Jolla. Near its intersection with North Torrey Pines 
Road, there’s a 200-meter haven of free parking on both sides 
of the street. It’s only a five-minute walk to Revelle, and you 
can park your ride there for an unlimited amount of time (cars 
have been there, unmoving, for weeks). The only downside is 
that it’s often full, and you may have to circle around a couple 
times before a spot opens up. For more short-term parking, 
there are plenty of two-hour spots along La Jolla Shores Drive, 
across from Pacific Hall and Urey Hall in Revelle. 

BEST PARKING OFF CAMPUS

ON CAMPUS  ÑARIELLE SALLAI
Tucked away behind the Warren res halls, the 
Warren canyon meets all the requirements to find 
your spirit animal — no RSO disturbances, plenty 
of fresh air and a slight sensation of otherworldli-
ness. Explore it deeply enough, and you might 
stumble across the perfect clearing to circle up and 
feel enlightened. When you’re done laughing at 
your friends’ discoveries that they are sea turtles, 
arctic wolves and — we aren’t shitting you — race 
cars, Earl’s Place is just around the bend to satisfy 
your munchies. Just don’t get lost on your way.

OFF CAMPUS  
     ÑREGINA IP

It’s easy for the bus-bound 
undergrad to lurch into Ralphs 
when the need for Honey 
Bunches of Oats becomes too 
strong — it’s the closest off-
campus grocery store and has 
everything from Twinkies to 
trail mix, even if the parking lot 
is a nightmare. But the conve-
nience comes at a price incom-
parable to the supposed benefits 
— sure, it’s open 24 hours, but 
the food isn’t always healthy. 
And though the organic label 
on Trader Joe’s and Whole 
Foods products is alluring, the 
price tag puts them out of the 
broke college student’s reach. 

If you’re aiming for some-
thing that’s healthy and rea-
sonably priced, then head to 
Henry’s Farmers Market — a 
natural foods store that’s remi-
niscent of old-fashioned pro-
duce stands and neighborhood 
butchers. 

The closest store is located 
at 3358 Governor Dr. which is a 
10-minute car ride from UCSD. 
For those without personal 
four-wheeled transport, the 41 
bus route goes to the second-
closest Henry’s, on Genesee 
Avenue.

As famous for its world-class surf as for its nude sunbathers, Black’s Beach 
is five minutes from campus and offers something for every beachgoer. 

Within this mile-long stretch of coastline there is hiking, hang-gliding, 
surfing, boogie-boarding, legal skinny-dipping and even late-night 

bonfires. There are Porta-Potties at the top of the cliffs, a small dining 
facility and even a nice table to sit and eat at while watching hang-
gliders drift by on a gentle breeze. If you aren’t frightened by the 

old naked man with a backpack and tennis shoes who spends his 
mornings striding confidently up and down the beach, then join 
him in spirit by going for an au naturel swim. For the faint of 
heart, steer clear by hanging a left once you hike down to the 
beach — there is a designated place for those in swimsuits too. 
The only downside is the hike back up the cliffs from sea level 
to city level (a problem made easier by a healthy helping of 
Captain Mo).

OFF CAMPUS                    ÑIMRAN MANJI
With dozens of Mexican joints offering carne asada fries in La Jolla 

alone, the competition is fierce, but Lolita’s is clearly the best 
spot in San Diego to chow down on this SoCal classic. The 

Clairemont location serves up a gigantic, sumptuous 
plate of tender carne asada meat and crispy fries 

smothered in cheese and sour cream for $7.50. 
The salsa bar offers excellent variety and a spicy 

kick for those with more fiery cravings, while 
generous helpings of guacamole balance out 

the flavors. Make sure to bring a friend, 
since conquering this behemoth solo is 

impossible. 
The only knock on the dish is 

Lolita’s 9 p.m. closing time, which 
has prevented this all-around 

excellent Mexican establish-
ment from gaining as much 

recognition as legend-
ary late-night spots like 
Rigoberto’s and Vallarta 
that capitalize on the 
drunken college crowd. 
It’s a shame: These fries 
are so tasty, you don’t 
need to be hammered 

to find yourself suffering 
from late-night cravings.

If you’re a tormented sports fan and your team has finally done something that doesn’t 
make you want to tear your hair out, there is really only one place on campus you should go 
to: Round Table Pizza. For one, they have food and, more importantly, beer. If you’re under 
21, grab a friend who isn’t, make ‘em buy a cheap pitcher of Bud and ask for a water cup so 
you can mooch (just don’t get caught or you’ll look like a chump). Secondly, they have huge 
TVs so you won’t have to squint to see your favorite beard or freak in action. Located in the 
corner of Price Center Plaza next to Jamba Juice, the pizza chain is usually empty enough 
come game time that you won’t have a problem finding a seat. But you better hope that your 
team wins, or else the combination of beer, anger and a public place could get embarrass-
ing.  Rangers fan? Round Table delivers to your dorms so you can sustain your own pity party.

Two-for-one drinks from 4 to 8 p.m., followed by two-for-one drinks from 
10 p.m. to close. No cover charge, ever. Endless sliders on Mondays and 
Thursdays. Nachos the size of the ones in your dreams. Five dol-
lars for all-you-can-eat tacos on Tuesdays. PB’s Cabo Cantina 
is the Valhalla of alcoholism — it’s a Chargers bar that has 
been the source of many blackout nights for San Diego’s 
drunken finest. It’s a tiny place, crammed in between 
Bub’s Dive Bar and Sinbad’s on Garnet Avenue, with 
sports decor straight out of Mexico — murals of half-
naked women cover the walls, neon Mexican beer 
signs provide the mood lighting and the fake palm tree 
pillars add to the atmosphere. The bouncers are large 
and intimidating at first glance, but talk to them and 
they’ll end up on your Facebook like any other drinking 
buddy. The bartenders are always friendly and attentive, and 
if you don’t feel like wading through people to get to the bar, 
there are plenty of waitresses to help get you liquored up. The 
bar’s few drawbacks — which boil down to a grand total of two 
bathrooms to share amongst seal-breaking patrons and a midnight 
closing time — are hardly deal-breakers when you can get blasted for 
half the price of other bars and stumble next door when Cabo shuts down.

whistle blew.”

The win moved UCSD into the 
second round of the NCAA tourna-
ment, where the team faced No. 2 seed 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii.

The game’s lone goal came early 
in the match when the defensive pair-
ing of Wilson and Johnson combined 
for their third game-winning goal of 
the season. In the 15th minute of the 
match, Johnson lined up to take what 
would be one of her 15 corner kicks of 
the night. Johnson sent the ball into 
the box to find the head of Wilson, 
and the sophomore was able to beat 
her defender to put the Tritons up 1-0.  

The goal marked the ninth assist for 
Johnson — who was recently awarded 
all-conference honorable mention — 
and Wilson’s third goal of the season.

From then on, Wilson and 
Johnson, along with junior defender 
Sara Spaventa and senior midfielder 
Lisa Bradley, effectively shut out the 
BYU attack to preserve the Tritons’ 1-0 
lead. The Seasiders, who had only one 
loss this season coming into the match, 
were allowed only seven shots on goal, 
none of which were on frame.  

“Our entire team had a solid week-
end,” Wilson said. “Defensively, we 

were able to shut down BYU’s threats 
because of our cover for each other. 
Our players coming off the bench also 
made huge impacts on the game and 
raised our level of play.” 

UCSD will advance to the Sweet 16 
to make its second consecutive appear-
ance in the third round of the national 
tournament. The Tritons will face No. 
1 seed Seattle Pacific University next 
Thursday in Texas on the campus of 
St. Edward’s University.

The Tritons will find a tough oppo-
nent in ninth-ranked Seattle Pacific. 
The Falcons are 16-1-2 overall and 
have won their past nine matches. 
Seattle Pacific also boasts a recent 
national championship, winning the 
national tournament in 2008 after 
defeating the Tritons in the first round 
of the West Regionals.  

But Wilson said the Triton squad is 
feeling strong and will be ready for its 
next challenge.

“Our team is confident going into 
the next round, and we’re ready to 
work hard to get the job done,” Wilson 
said. “With our season having been 
cut short last year in the Sweet 16 by 
[Cal State Dominguez Hills], we are 
especially motivated to advance.”

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Nearly 
a month ago, women’s volleyball 
head coach Ricci Luyties said that 
his team would need to win every 
single one of its remaining matches 
to stay in postseason contention. 
The Tritons were on track until the 
last day of the regular season, but 
a loss in their final game didn’t 
stop the team from getting into the 
NCAA tournament.

The Tritons needed five sets to 
complete a comeback against Cal 
Poly Pomona on Friday, as UCSD 
extended its winning streak to 11 
matches despite dropping the first 
two sets. That winning streak was 
abruptly halted on Saturday, when 
No. 6 Cal State San Bernardino swept 
the Tritons to complete its fifth con-
secutive CCAA Championship. 

Despite the loss, the Tritons 
still earned a berth into the NCAA 
Division II tournament for the fifth 
year in a row. The squad was given 
the fourth seed in the West Region, 
and will face conference rival 
Sonoma State on Nov. 18. 

Against Pomona, the Tritons lost 
both of the first two sets 25-22, but 
came back to win the next three by 
scores of 25-15, 25-19 and 15-11.  
Junior Katie Condon had a game-

high 15 kills and 23 digs, junior 
Hilary Williamson added 12 kills 
and 20 digs and the Tritons pulled 
out of the hole they created for 
themselves early in the match. 

Even after rallying to force a fifth 
set, the Tritons nearly let the match 
slip away in the final game as the 
Broncos took a 9-5 lead. But they 
refused to go away and scored 5 
straight points to make the score 
10-9. With the set score tied at 
11-11, the Tritons went on a 4-0 run 
to seal the win.

“Everything was going wrong for 
us the first two games,” Luyties said. 
“To overcome all that I thought was 
really good.”

But on Saturday, the Tritons suf-
fered their worst defeat of the sea-
son as they lost 3-0 to nationally 
sixth-ranked San Bernardino. The 
Coyotes never trailed on their way 
to winning their first two sets 25-14 
and 25-19, and emphatically ral-
lied to take the third set 25-18. The 
Tritons hit just .120 on the match 
as the Coyotes cruised to their 12th 
straight victory. 

“They really don’t have much of 
a weakness with their team,” Luyties 
said. “With that, we have to play a 
really good match, and we did not. 
We had a couple players play pretty 
well, but I thought that, all around, 
it wasn’t one of the best matches 

for quite a few of our starters — 
although I’m glad it happened this 
weekend instead of next weekend.”

The Tritons finished the regular 
season 18-8 overall and 15-7 in the 
CCAA.

UCSD will face Sonoma State 
for the third time this season on 
Nov. 19. The Tritons swept the first 
match on Sept. 11, but were pushed 
to a tiebreaking fifth set in their 
second meeting on Oct. 15. The 
Seawolves have won five of their last 
six matches, and the team is looking 
for its first tournament win in the 
school’s history.

Luyties said his players will be 
wary of Sonoma State, despite the 
success they’ve had against the 
Seawolves this season.

“That’s a tricky thing,” Luyties 
said. “Sonoma is a good team, and 
I think the times they’ve played us 
they haven’t played their best. It’s 
happened in the past with teams I’ve 
coached, where we beat a team twice 
in a season, then lost to them the 
third time for whatever reason; they 
play better, you’re overconfident or 
you think you’re going to win, and 
that scares me. If we play well, we 
can beat them, but it still worries 
me.”

HAWAIIAN 
HEROICS

UCSD Soccer rolled to two  
victories in Hawaii last week, 

sending the squad into the third 
round of the NCAA tournament.

The No. 12 women’s soccer team will advance to the third round  of the NCAA national tournament, after defeating first-round 
opponents San Francisco State 3-1 and second-round opponents 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii 1-0 on Saturday.

After losing to San Francisco State last week in the first round of 
conference playoffs, UCSD got the better of the Gators in the open-
ing match of the national tournament last Thursday, Nov. 11. The 
3-1 victory marked the Tritons’ 11th win in their past 12 matches, as 
well as head coach Brian McManus’s 400th career win.

The Gators opened up the scoring in the 50th minute when San 
Francisco State forward Kara Cunningham collected a pass and slot-
ted the ball past junior Triton goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong, putting 
the Gators up 1-0.  

San Francisco State’s lead was shortlived, as a goal just two min-
utes later from junior midfielder Shelby Wong tied the game at 1-1. 
In the 52nd minute, junior forward and conference second team 
selection Sarah McTigue sparked the Triton offense when she got 
around her defender to get inside the Gator goalbox. McTigue found 
senior forward Annette Ilg, who fired a shot that was deflected to the 
feet of Wong, and the junior midfielder easily put the ball away to 
score her third goal of the season.

The Tritons captured the lead in the 65th minute when sopho-
more defender Ellen Wilson scored off a corner kick from fellow 
sophomore defender Hayley Johnson. The Tritons outshot the 
Gators 4 to 23, and secured the win in the 83rd minute with an unas-
sisted goal from junior midfielder Courtney Capobianco.

“I think we went into the second half with a lot of energy and 
confidence,” Wong said. “When we went down early, we responded 
really well to get the tying goal, and then another two to take the 
lead. After playing San Francisco earlier, we knew we had the abil-
ity to take it to them, and when it really counted, we did what we had

The Tritons’ next opponent will be Seattle Pacific University, who is the 
top-ranked team in the West Region and ranked ninth nationally. The Falcons have 
just one loss this season, on Sept. 30 against Western Washington University. The 
two squads shared common opponents this season in Humboldt State and BYU-
Hawaii. Seattle Pacific easily beat Humboldt 3-0, but played to a scoreless draw with 
BYU-H. The Tritons suffered one of their two losses this season against Humboldt 
on Sept. 17, but beat BYU-H 1-0 to advance to play against Seattle Pacific. However, 
Seattle Pacific played both these opponents back in the first week of the season, and 
it is impossible to gauge how each team has grown since. The Falcons have scored 
more goals per game and allowed fewer goals per game than the Tritons, but the 
Tritons play in a tougher conference than Seattle Pacific. The Falcons field a bal-
anced attack with six players scoring four goals or more, but so do the Tritons, with 
seven players with at least three goals on the season. In total, this leads to a match 
between two very good teams that are not familiar with each other, and whichever 
squad does better at taking its chances and limiting mistakes will emerge as the win-
ner.
