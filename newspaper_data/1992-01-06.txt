Groundwork, Administration Draft Proposal 
• Co-op reopens after Dec. 19 closing due to agreement to negotiate university's vendor contract 
.,...,aetty ...... 
News Editor 

Despite a tumultuous fall quarter 
and winter break, the university and 
Groundwork Books worked to-
gether to draft a proposal in which 
they ~ to negotiare "in good 
faith" over a contract offered to the 
bookstore by the university. 

extension is requested, could affect 
the other UCSDco-ops, which have 
been ordered to choose either out-
side vendor status or to become 
auxiliary accounts of the university. 

Carruthers would not speculate 
as to whether the resulting Ground-
work contract will set a precedent 
for other C<H>ps. 

The proposal. dated Dec. 20 and 
signed by two representali ves from 
Groundwor~ Books, University 
Center Director Jim Carruthers, and 
Political Science professor Peter 
Irons. states that Groundwork will 
negotiale with the university over 
the tenns of the university's con-
tract vendor agreement. 

The signing of the Dec. 20 pro-
posal means that Groundwork has 
accepted the status of a non-univer-
sity entity, or "contract vendor," 
and will negotiate the terms of a 
contract appropriate to thai status. 

The Groundwork Collective ini-
tially wished only to negotiate with 
the university regarding contract 
vendor status, and even suggested a

Mother Teresa 
Improving in 
La Jolla Clinic 
By Jason Snell 
Senior Staff Writer 

Doctors at Scripps Clinic in La 10lla said 
yesterday that the health of Nobel Peace Prize 
winner Mother Teresa of Calcutta is improv-
ing, and indicated that she may be moved out 
of the clinic's intensive care unit soon. 

1be world-renowned humanitarian was 
admitted to Scripps Clinic, located just north 
of the UCSD Campus on North Torrey Pines 
Road, on Dec. 26. 

She was in the San Diego area to visit the 
Missionaries of Charity in Tijuana, her last 
stop on a worldwide tour. 

Doctors initially diagnosed her with bac-
terial pneumonia, but an inadequate blood 
supply to her heart caused a brief episode of 
heart failure on Dec. 28. D9ctors performed 
angioplasty, a procedure that clears block-
ages in arteries, on Dec. 29. 

On Friday, doctors upgraded Mother 
Teresa's condition from serious to fair, and 
said that her heartbeat was regular and her 
pneumonia showed signs of improvement.

VIsual Arts Department Breaks Ground for New Buildings 
• Insufficient classroom and studio space have long warranted an upgrade, Y.A. professor says 
By-.,Betty ...... 
News Editor. 

Afterenduring over 20 years of whal a former 
department chair calls inadequate office, class-
room and studio space, the Visual Arts Depart-
ment broke ground Dec. 13 on a new 70,000 
square-foot facility. 

1be site, which will soon grow into a series of 
one and two· story buildings with counyards, is 

. localCd on the Matthews Campus, where the 
Physical Plant Service buildings and the daycare 
center trailers once stood. The project is expected 
to be completed by the fall of 1993. 

1be facility will have SO,OOO square feet of 
assignable space to house faculty and department 
offices, SO graduate studios, 20 faculty studios, 
assemblylperformance space, an exhibit gallery, 
wood, metal and frame shops and laboraJories for 
photography, computing, electronics and media. 

Visual Arts Professor and fonner Visual Arts 
Department 0Wr David Antin emphasized the 
need for the new facility, saying that the depart-
IDCd had originally objected to the design of 
Mandeville Center, the central location of the 
depanmed. 

"Mandeville Center is probably the worst-
designed building in history. The building was 
senseless in every aspect... grim, foreboding, 
crude and ugly," Antin said 

"Ideally it should have been a building for 
undergraduares, but it was so inhospitable that 
we figured that only graduates could deal with 
it," Antin added. Undergraduate classes are cur-
rently taught in the quonset huts on the Matthews 
Campus, and also in vacant spaces in various 
buildings around campus. 

"We are considered one of the best art depart-
ments in the country [and we] have the most 
shocking physical situation," Antin said. 

He added that the university would have left 
thedepartrnent in its present location because the 
department does not have as much pull as, for 
example, science departments, which bring 
money to the university in the form of research 
grants. 

According to Antin, the department lacked 
adequate studio space for faculty members, and 
studios once occupying a Physical Plant Ser-
vices garage area were moved to a building at the 
School of Medicine on Gilman Drive. 

The site of the new Visual Arts facility. 
Antin said he feels that the department would 

not have received funding for the new facility, 
were it not for the fact that the School of Medi-
cine wants to build where the Visual Arts faculty 
currently have their tudios. 

The majority of the funding for the project 
comes from the state of Cali fomi a, with an added

to negotiate in good faith and h0pe-

tract that is accepcable to us." said

wOIt 10 agree to negotiare acontract 
vendor II8J"CI1leOt or be eliminated 
as a retail entity on campus. 

Just prior 10 S pm., Groundwork 
held a press conference in which 
they expressed their grievances with 
the university and listed actions taken 
in the paSt few months. 

Grievances included the eslab-
lislunent by the university of the 
Dec. 19 deadline, which Ground-
work says violates its space agree-
ment with the UCB. According to 
Groundwork, the administration 
failed to provide specific citations 
of Groundwork's violations of 
PPMs. 

Groundwork membersalso cited 
Carruthers' decision to ignore a Dec. 
2 resolution by the UCB intended to 
freeze action taken against Ground-
work until after the winter break. 

According to Carruthers, he did 
not follow the UCB resoIuIion be-
cause "it wasn't within the purview 
of the UCB. Groundwork Boob 
was vio1ating university policy. not 
UCB policy." 

At the press conference, which 
was attended by reporters from 
KNSD, TM San Diego Union. The 
San Diego Tribune, as wen as The 

UCSD GlMlrdian. Groundwork 
member SIeve Dubb, UCB OIair 
Molly McKay, and Co-op Repro-

readswanents. Groundwork mem-
bers also packed up boxes and 
cleared shelves. 

" They have been employ-
if1 people illegci1/y. 

Period. 

" JIM CARRUTHERS 
University Center Director 

At oS p.m., Carruthers posted a 
notice at Groundwork saying that 
the collective did not accept the 
university's offer to become a con-
tract vendor prior to the university's 
deadline, thus, Groundwork Books 
was pennanentlyclosed and the text-
books the store stocks would be 
available at the General Store Co-
op or at the University Bookstore. 

Carruthers' notice also stated that 
the collective confinued on Nov. 6 
that it would not follow the univer-
sity Policy and Procedure Manual 
(PPM). 

On Nov. 6, Groundwork had sent 
fmancial infonnation to the univer-
sity which included the fact that 
Groundwork routed its payroll 
through the United Cooperative 
Association Incorporated (UCA), a 
leasing company. 

According to Patel and Betsy 
Olsen. also of Groundwork, the 
bookstore's employees are actually 
contract workers employed by UCA. 
which processes the student work-
ers'paychecb.GroundworkBooks 

The UCSD Guardian 

then reimburses UCA for the wages 
paid. 

According 10 Olsen. for the last 
15 years Groundwork paid its em-
ployees as independent contractors. 
But, Patel said, .. It was bad .. , be-
cause we had to pay self~mploy­
ment tax of 15 percent instead of 
[the'normal) seven percent." 

Both Olsen and Patel contend ' 
thal the PPM does not'specify that 
using a leasing company is a Viola-
tion, and the Groundwork Collec-
tiveona whole insists that Canuthers 
has not yet stated which PPMs the 
co-op violated . 

Carruthers, however, simply 
said, "They have been employing 
people illegally. Period." 

On Dec. 20, after some Ground-
work Collective members had spent 
the night in the store and the elec-
tricity had been hut off, Carruthers 
visited the store. 

Irons said he arrived at the store 
soon after to see what was going on, 
He said Carruthers and Groundwork 
collective-member Lorna Lueker 
were in an argument over 
Groundwork's tatus: 

Patel and Olsen credit Irons with 
intervening and beginning negotia-
tions. 

"'They were all standing outside 
arguing vehemently about this. My 
majorconcem was getting Ground-
work open for the quarter," Irons 
said 

Irons said he took an interest in 
Groundwork because he is inter-
ested in student-run businesses, and 
because his students buy their books 
from the store. 

As a volunteer, Irons negotiated 
with Canuthers and Groundwork 
Books representatives until they 
came up with the proposal.

SPECIAL COMMENTARY SECTION 

A Fight on 
Hands ... 

Only a few short months ago, the American news 

media were reporting that President Bush 
would walle all over any Democrat who 

dared to challenge him in the '92 
election. Riding high on the U.S. 
victory in the Persian Gulf War, 

it looked as if nothin$ could 
bring Bush down. Olants of 
''four more years,,: CQUld be 
heard across the countty as 

war veterans paraded down 
the streets of every city in . 

America Then reality settled 

• 

back in, and so did a recession. 

And before long, the chanters fell 

silent, and what looked like a blowout 

turned irito a presidential race . 
See page 06 & 07 

A Bleak Economic Outlookr 
We have been given witch doctor solutions to the recession: "tie a chicken around your 

neck, dance in circles, cut credit card interest rates to 15 percenL" These solutions, 

offered from across the political spectrum, would be funny if ~y weren't so damaging . 
When the economy is suffering a crisis of confidence,. we need stability and ... prudence.

Oh, grow up. The Left has been

Sure, we're having some rain, but

RECESSION 
ContInued from pace 04 

federal government should do 
nothing major to "fax" the reces-
sion. In fact, recessions are good 
for the country. Not all the time, 
certainly, and DOl with the fre-
quency we would have with a 
Democrat in the White House, but 
occasionally. It i, depressing to 
watch the lay-offs at General Mo-
tors, but as an auto worker union 
leader pointed out, the country 
has been lelling GM to clean up its 
act for a long time. If it didn't, 
many more jobs would be lost. A 
little more bard times, and the GM 
executi ves might actually cut their 
outrageous salaries and pensions. 

Moreover, it seems a lillie 
hypocritical for the averago· 
American to scream about the idi-
ots who inhabit Washington, then 
ellpect them to save the economy. 
Do you really want the economy 
to be in the hands of the peoplo 
who brought us midnight pay

fiasco of the Thomas hearings?

finances? Then why expect them 
to handle an enormous U.S. 
economy? 

Recessions can have a cleans-
ing effect on the economy, and 
they are inevitable. Conservative 

economists had been trying to ex-
plain this to the followers of 
Keynes for a long time. But the 
Liberals maintained that fiscal 
policy was the answer to every-
thing. Then after the Federal Re-
serve policies in the early '80s, 
combined with tax cuts,led to the 
longest peacetime expansion in 
U.S. history, conservatives have 
forgotten this lesson. They seem 
to believe that monetary policy 
and tax cuts can always save the 
economy. 

Tax cuts arc wonderful things. 
and we should have more of them 
(along with large spending cuts) 
when this recession is over. And 
the policies of Alan Greenspan 
and the governors of the Fed have 
been exactly right-<:ut intere t 
rates to the bone, but keep a tight 
grip on inflation. But no policy 
can stop recessions. We will have 
to simply weather the storm.ln 
this case, it would be best if the 
politicians neither talked much 
about the economy nor did any-
thing about it.

Mel MarceIoiGuanfian 

Bush is looking less like 'Iron George' 
and more like George Foreman 
By Ben ao,chuk 
Opinion Edilor 

Only a few sbon months ago, the American news 
media were reporting that President Bush would 
walk. allover any Democrat who dared to cballenge 
him in the '92 election. The Democrats were running 
scared; many potential candidates rumored to be 
consjdering a run, like Dick Gepbardt and AI Gore. 
held press conferences to announce that they would 
nol be running. 

The Bush Juggernaut has faltered, and the glori-
ous military triumph in the Persian Gulf has lost 
much of its appeal in the few months since our victory 
there. The president's approval has plummeted in the 

or two to get what he waDIS.

to declare his candidacy was some 
unknown ex-Senator from Massachu-

on the U.S. victory in the Persian Gulf 
War, it looIccdas if nothing could bring 
Bush down. You could hear jubilant 
chants of "four more years" reverber-

Not only did the Democrats muster

More intriguing. though. is thechal-
lenge to Bush which comes from COI15ervanve col-
umnist and "Crossfire" ctHlost Pauick J. Buchanan. 
In the 1980s, the cardinal Nle of politics under 
Ronald Reagan ("the Eleventh Commandment. .. as it 
was known) was that no Repubtican shall speak evil 
of another Republiam. But extreme circumstances 
often call for extreme measures. 

Formanyconservatives, Bush has commiued one 
too many heresies. In his anJJOUJX:emeIlt, Buchanan 
said of the president: "George Bush ... is a man of 
graciousness, honor and integrity who bas given balf 
a).ifetime to his nation's service. But the differences 
between us are now too deep. He is yesterday and we 
are tomonow." 

Buchanan represents the feeling of many Ameri-
cans - and especially the middle-class - that 
Gecrge Bush and government in general bas put the 
squeeze OIl them for far too long. They ~ tired of 
being taxed day in and day out. Taxes on the middle 
class have increased while incomes have fallen. They 
are tired of being told that they need to accept 
responsibility for every social ill in America today. 
They arc tired of the political doublespeak ofincum-
bent politicians, which is why many states (including 
California) have passed tenn-limit laws in the last 
two years. 

For many Americans, Buchanan represents the 
bare-knuckle brawling poHtician who would have no 
problem with lticking the bell out of a Congressman 

Pany's nomination, lei alone win 
in a general election. Deep down, even IrL probMIIy 
knows it. 

Strangely, Bush and the Republican NaIiooaI

08 OPINION Monday, January 6, 1992 

Lead Us Not Into 
National Health Insurance 

The American voter has fallen in love with an impossible ~ 
By Matt Robinson 
Associate Opinion Editor 

What can one safely say about the 
1992 election? 

With so many pundits. savants and 
"experts" running around as if they have 
something constructive 10 say I think the 
correcl answer i realJy, "nothing." What 
elections tell us on various level is 
usually not clear because the voter is a 

strange animal and a politician is geared to find the voter's weak 
point and exploit il to the hilt. 

Thi might make one cynical. even misanthropic, but it i the 
way of the world. Politician are a fairly uncommined. cowardly 
lot. 1be statesman, the individual willing to stick to his gun • is 
rare, indeed. 

But what election do deliver i an interesting in ight into 
human nature. Voters motivated by unresttained self-interest 
with political pied pipers all too happy to play their tempting 
songs combine to leave onJy the rats in control. Invariably we 
find what is tickling the voter's funny bone at election time. And 
apparently this time national health insurance is the pied piper's 
tune. 

Of course, the rhetoric is the same. "Vote for me and I'll 
conven those votes into free heal'" insurance for every man, 
woman and child in America." With the victory of Harris 
Wofford in Pennsylvania over former Anorney General Dick 
Thornburgh, Democratic ranks have been wild with exultation. 
His secret weapon? National health insurance. Wofford's upset 
over a close friend of Bush and a two-time governor has shot the 
issue into the public spotlight. 

Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, a longtime supporter of 
national health insurance. has played it up and has made it one of 
his main campaign pledge. But what makes this funny is that 
these demands come in the trough of a recession and the wake of 
rectlrd national deficits. The Los Angeles Times unconsciously 
made the whole dilemma quite clear. It had a front-page story 
which reported thaI some economic experts saw the economy 
growing slowly throughout the decade of the '90s. The story 
cited excessive spending as a major cause. 

Ironically, next to this story was another headline that said 
Democratic candidates support national health insurance, the 
cost of which is estimated in the hundreds of billions. One 
article was decrying excessive spending, the other described 
policies guaranteed to add to that deficit. The American voter 
has falJen in love with big government. 

Of course, we have political candidates who are trying to 
convince us that we really need it. And aU of the hot air and 
moralistic crusading is being done in the face of facts. 

First, the United States pends more per capita on the health 
of its citizens than any other COWltry. Great Britain. with its 
National Health Service, spends the lowest. While there are 
those who wish to declaim the U.S. sy tern, the United States is 
the most efficient and technologically advanced in the world. 

For instance, compared to Canada. the U.S. has eight times

radiation therapy units, six times more lithoptripsy units (used for 
nonsurgical removal of kidney stones) and about three times 
more open-hean surgery units and cardiac-catheterization units 
per capita. 

Secondly, some contend that with a national based health 
system, health care will become more accessible. nus is 
simply false. Both Britain and New Zealand have hospital 
services which are completely paid for by the government. 
Unfonunatcly, out of a population of 55 million, Britain's 
waiting list for surgery is 800,000. at: the three million New 
Zealanders, 50,000 are waiting for surgery. 

What is truly tnIgic is that one can all too easily forget that 
this cry for national health care is being made by the same people 
who brought you the lines at the Post OffIC:C and the $100 toilet 
seats at the Pentagon. This is not said for levity, but as a grim 
reminder that so much of what we invite the govenunent to do 
when there is a lesitimate need soon becomes abused and 
increasingly expensive. 

The evidence cited above indicates that national health 
insurance will only, literally, bring more pain and suffering. The 
inefficiency of government bureaucracies hu forced patients in 
Britain to have to wait up to two years for hip replacements and 
the Canadian press often repons patients mquiring bean surgeI)' 
dying in their wait for attention. 

"But perhaps we can make it work this time!" is the cry often 
heard. 

If the experiences of other countries are any indicalion. this is 
highly unlikely. In the last ten years the inefficiency of the 
system in Britain has caused privare insurance to double. The 
waiting lines in Britain and Canada continue to grow because the 
governments there ~fuse to spend more. But wbal this indicates 
is not an unwillingness but aenuine inability of the government 
to supply the insatiable demand. It stands to reason that '1'm: 
supply" means grearer demand. 

Of course, political oppoItUnists are pIqJIIJ'Cd to quoee bow 
many people need health ~ independent of the fICt dull 
someone must pay for their delusions of grandeur. But do we 
have a right to it and must the government supply it? 

I doubt anyone would wish to deny health to a feUow hwnan 
being. But the riaht to life and be8Itb does not translaIe to a . 
govClilmenl pcaoplive.1f it does, thea Joe Six-pack is going to 
demand via the accond amendment thal everyone be outfitted 
with a 12-puae shotgun. He mighl even contend, if he is 
running for office. thal this is cheaper than national health 
insurance. 

But the pIinfu1 reality is that national beaIth insunn:e is DOC 
free. It just seems thIt way when the tupeycr fools the bill. 
Remember thal the most COIIICrVaaive ad" .. of the au 
illac.e. required to pay for this "free service" an: in the 
neighborhood of $235 billion. 

Of course. the claims of OW' politicians continue to feed oft' of

Men's Bask~ball Takes Toomey Title 
• UCSD beats Redlands 
on Friday and Southern 
California College on 
Saturday to take first 
place in the La JoUa 
Oassic Tournament 
By Ken PerImen 
Sports Editor 

1bere's a new breed of Triton 
basketball player. 

While the UCSD men's basket-
ball teams of the past seasons have 
beenquick,outside shootin& threats, 
the 1991-92 squad bas the bulk and 
strength to take the game inside the 
paint. 

This weekend's La Jolla Clas-
sic showed just how effective that 
new sayle is proving to be as the 
Tritons came away with two wins 
in two games and made • lasting 
impression on some powerful divi-
sion rivals. 

UCSD opened the four-team 
weekend tournament with a 115-80 
troWlCing of lhe University of 
Redlands. 

1be Bulldogs, a team nocorious 
fortheirOUlSideshooring,presSured 
the Tritons early, especially from 
the lhrce-point line. Redlands fin-
ished the evening 10 of 20 from 
downtown. 

1be bigger Tritons were also 
ready forsomescoringaslhcynailed 
44 of 78 shots, 56 percent, from the 
floor. 20 of those points came from 
center Rick Ban, who also pulled 
down 12 rebounds.

out the Triton's attack dishing off a

Crusaders Capitalize on Frigid Triton Offense 
• Despite defensive 
effort, low shooting 
percentage hurts UCSD; 
Point Lorna wins by 22, 
By Greu Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor 

With the number of bricks the 
UCSD women's basketball team 
threw up on Saturday night, it was 
hard to tell whether they were play-
ing on a court or in a construclion 
ite. Despite a solid defensive ef-

fort, the Tritons shot a paltry 37per-
cenl from the floor on their way 10 a 
66-44 loss to Point Lorna Nazarene 
College. 

The UCSD offense goc off 10 a 
bad start and went downhill from 
there. The Tritons, now 64 on the 
year, missed their first fourshOlS, all 
of them layups, and the Crusaders 
jumped out to a 10-0 lead. 

"It was a totalJy off night, we jusl 
couldn' l hit," said UCSD Head 
Coach Judy Malone. 1be Tritons, 
in addition to their 19 for 52 field 
goal perfonnance, shot a frigid six 
for 23 from the free throw line. 

Lisa Beaver led UCSD with 12 
points and 13 rebounds. helping 
UCSD 10 take a 43-40 edge on the 
boards. 

Despile their offensive woes, 
Malone was happy with her team's 

defensive effort. The Tritons held 
PLNC's top scorer, Rochelle light-
ner, 10 jusl five for 12 shooting and 
14 points overall. Poinl Lorna's 
ChrisI)' Stevens topped all scorers 
with 18 points. 

"We did what we needed to do 
defensively," said Malone. "We 
comp1etely shut down lheiroffense, 
so that they had to start free-lancing 
and driving in." 

UCSD did have anocher bright 
spot, the return of senior forward 
Carl Young to the lineup. Young, 
who underwent surgery on her knee 
for 10m cartilage three weeks ago, 
scored six points for the Tritons. 

Overall, it was noc a complete 
disaster for Malone and her tearn. 
"It was just one of those nighls. We 
contrI>lled them well on defense. It 
was just our shooting thal killed us. 
Hopefully, we've got this night out 
of our syslem and we' ll be back for 
our next game." 

A week ago, the Tritons hosted 
the UCSD Invitational Tournament, . 
featuring seven tearns, including 
UCSDnemesis Gustavus Adolphus. 
Hoping for a Shol at the Golden 
Gusties, the Tritonsopened the tour-
nament with a win over Norwich. 
But UCSD couldn't gCl around its 
nextopponent, Concordia, who went 
on 10 beat GustaVUS Adolphus in the QIID ~ 
finals. UCSOforward Molly Jonnwn Is doubkHeamed as she prepares to shoot.
