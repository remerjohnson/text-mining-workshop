Who is next? 
It is no fun being a world leader any longer. 
Last week's assasination of Egyptian President 

Anwar Sadat drives home how vulnerable public 
figures are to senseless violence. 

The death of Sadat, and the attempts upon 
President Reagan and John Paul II were all motivated 
for different reasons, But whereas the intents of their 
a~sasms wereunalike, the intended final result was 
the same: to change a political situation by 
eliminating the most important actor. 

Saturday's funeral for Sadat was a closed affair. 
The Egyptian public was kept away. Neither Reagan 
nor Vice President George Bush attended . The reason 
for all this: security, Both the Egyptian and American 
governments felt, and rightly so, that the funeral 
represented a serious threat to those in attendance, 

It is truly sad that world leaders must live in the 
con ·tant fear of as 'asination. The terrorism that 
pervades world politics is a fact that we must live 
with, but not accept. One does not have to agree with 
or admire Anwar Sadat to feel anger and 'orrow over 
the circumstances of his death . One can only hope 
that someday nations such as Egypt will settle their 
political differences with votes and words, not guns. 

And a person cannot help but ask, " Who will be the 
next victim?" 

Letter to the Editor 

More on anorexia 
Editor: 

While I appreciate your 
attention to an issue which 
affects a number of men and 
women - and your ability to 
inform students about our 
services - your recent article, 
Anorexia: a crisis on the 
campuses (UCSD Guardian. 
Oct. 8), contains a number of 
inaccuracies. Moreover, I am 
concerned about the sensa· 
tionalistic tone of presentation 
which I fear will discourage 
people from openness about 
their own difficulties, a 
concern which [ voiced clearly 
to the reporter. My concern . 
are: 

- Our group , which 
provides therapy for persons 
with eating problems, is not for 
those persons who know or are 
concerned about someone with 
these issues. If you know 
s omeone who has these 
problems, we would be glad to 
talk with you about suggesting 
to them where they can get 
help , but he group is for people 
who have self ·identified eating 
a a problem and are seeking 
to change their behavior. 

- Both anorexia and 
bulimia are associated with 
ph ysica l problem s, but 

obviously the death that can 
result for an anorexic i a more 
final outcome than the serious 
phys ical consequences of 
bulimia, However, short of 
death, there are debilitating 
physical problems which may 
or may not be reversible 
(dependi ng on a variety of 
factors) for a person who 
starves themself. 

- In the last paragraph the 
word "cure" was used . I prefer 
not to use the medical model of 
"ill ness" and "cure" and did 
not use these terms with the 
reporter. People use food to 
solve problems and the food 
problems, the eating problems, 
that result begin to be resolved 
when other ways of dealing 
with life are discovered and 
integrated . 

Both group and 'individual 
counseling are available at 
Counseling and Psychological 

ervices for persons on 
campus who feel their eating 
may be problematic, Each 
person brings a unique way of 
dealing with the world and 
g neralizat ions can often 
mis leading. Thi s uniquenegg 
will be resp ted.

Oliphant 

The Middle East after Sadat 
BY ARTHUR HERTZBERG 

Pacific News Service 
Anwar Sadat was a gallant, 

wise. courageous, proud and 
gracious man. He was also 
wily, imperious and con· 
temptuous of those in the Arab 
world who opposed him. We do 
not know yet who was behind 
his murder, but one thing is 
instantly clear: he was the 
victim of those who hated his 
better nature. 

Sadat stood above and 
beyond his contemporaries 
because his vision of peace, 
and even of the Arab interest, 
was not bounded by cliche. He 
regained the Sinai by making 
peace with Israel while all the 
other Arab leaders have failed 
to win an inch back by talk of 
eternal war with the Zionists, 
Not since the days of Saladin 
have Egypt and its ruler been 
held in such respect in the 
world, Yet, few among those 
who knew him and who have 
some sense of Egypt in recent 
years can be surprised at this 
murder. 

Sadat was clearly not 
himself a few weeks ago in an 
angry televi ed press 
conference that he gave to the 
Western press after he had 
clapped some 1,500 dissidents 
into jail. He was angry at the 
Western journalists for 
reporting the growing unrest 
being created by the 
Kh o meini · type Muslim 
brotherhood and the left-wing 
intelligensia, both of which 
wanted to undermine his 
orientation on America and 
the peace with Israel. It was 
the anger of a great prince who 
did not want the world to 
know that he was surrounded 
by too many jackals. 

For months, many Western 
analysts have been thinking 
that Sadat's regime was in 
trouble. The economy was in 
shambles, for no messianic 
redemption had come to the 
fore as a result of the peace 
\' ith Israel. M.:tny women a· 
mung the university s tudent s 
nov. are weari ng t he chador 
and many among the intelli · 
gem,ia say quite openly thaI 
I hey prefer t heir jobs or con· 
s ultant s hips in the oi l shiek· 
doms 10 the wisdom and glory 
of Sildal's foreign policy 

The immediate result of the 
as assination is obvious: 
Egypt i now un ·table, and ils 
immediate future is now in the 
hands of th army . How united 
its officer corps is or will 
remain is highly questionable. 
Ho ni Mubarak, the Vi ce 
Presid nt who survived the 

shooting, may very well serve 
for a while, but it is obvious 
that he has inherited neither 
Sadat's authority nor 
charisma. 

The Israelis will not, quite 
properly, be reluctant to 
complete the process of 
withdrawal from the Sinai, 
For their greatest and most 
persistent fear has now been 
realized, The question is now 
open: will the peace that Begin 
made with Sadat be honored 
by an Egypt which soon may 
well be controlled by Sadat's 
assassins? 

A bloody and time· honored 
tradition in the Arab world of 
shooting moderates and 
installing extremists contino 
ues. Israel certainly is even 
more likely to be confirmed in 
its opposition to territorial 
autonomy on the West Bank , 
for it cannot trust any 
moderate leaders there to 
survive. How indeed can one 
continue the Camp David 
process after its indispensible 
central figure has been slain? 

In American politics, the 
pressure of the Reagan 
administration to se ll Saudi 
Arabia A WACS and all kinds 
of other sophisticated military 
hardware may have been dealt 
an irreparable setback, The 
royal family in Mecca and 
Riyadh is no more proof 
against a machine gun or a 
hand grenade than was Sadat. 

On the day of Sad at 's 
murder, President Reagan 
may be driven to understand 
that the congressional 
opponents of the A WACS deal 
are trying to save America 
from possible and even 
probable debacle. On one 
murderous day in the future, 
they fear , American weapons 
of the most sophistical ed kind 
may fall into the hands of the 
most irresponsi ble of our 
enemies. 

Before some ultimate bar of 
history , President Reagan and 
even Richard Milhouse Nixon 
will one day have to answer for 
trying to se ll the United States 
this bad idea, while using 
thinly veiled anti ·Semitism a ' 
a tool. 

There remain the funda· 
mental que tion of what 
America is to do with the 
Middle East and for that 
matter the Third World . 

upporting di cta t o r s hips , 
from Baptis ta in Cuba in the 
1950s to the Shah in Iran in the 
1970s, onl y to have them fall to 
revolution , ha s failed 
disas trous ly again and again . 
Sadat was the very model of a 

moderate dictator, but even 
his leadership did not solve the 
internal problems of Egypt or 
quiet down the ultra · 
nationalists, 

It is easy and tempting to 
think of changing tactics and 
trying to protect America's 
interests in the Middle East by 
introducing our own military 
forces and by strengthening 
our military ties with Israel 
even further. Israel is stable, 
well·rooted and powerful. But 
even in concert with it, 
America cannot simply sit on 
the lid in the Middle East 
indefinitely. The problems of 
poverty, social change and the 
transformation of Arab 
nationalism from its present 
parochial angers will have to 
be faced . 

So long as oil matters to the 
industrial world, and so long 
as people matter to the 
Western conscience, America 
cannot afford either the Shah 
or Khomeini as the only 
alternatives in the Middle 
East. Sadat was the third 
option and he has now fallen. 

Only in the case of Israel 
have we found a pro· American 
government based on a pro· 
American people, The problem 
in the Arab world is that we 
have not yet approached the 
Arab people. We have dealt 
with the ruling circles and the 
wealthy - not the masses. No 
Arab society feels itself in a 
positive contact with America 
or with its government. 

The task of American and 
world statesmanship now is to 
find forces within the Arab 
world which want neither 
dictatorships of the left nor of 
the right - and then support 
them.

'We don't speak 
foreign languages' 

Vietname e is a tough 
language to learn. Spoken in 
s ix tonal level s, most word 
can have a ' many different 
meanings. 

When former Defense 
Secretary Robert S. McNa· 
mara visited Vietnam during 
the mid·1960s, he often 
proclaimed publically, in 
Vietnamese, " Vietnam for 
1,000 year !" Locals always 
I aughed at McNamara's 
inflections . They heard him 
say: "The duck wants to lie 
down!" 

Most of us have enough 
trouble with popular foreign 
languages such as French . An 
uncomfortable Ronald Reagan 
whispered to French Pre ident 
Francois Mitterrand at last 
month's Ottawa summit, 'Tm 
sorry, I only learned a few 
words of French in school." 

Recently some of the 
n atio n 's most prestigious 
school - Harvard, Yale and 
Stanford, among others -
have tried to crack down on 
such incompetency by 
reinstat ing foreign language 
requirements. But that may be 
the wrong approach. 

Tell most American 
student s that learning French 
or German is good for them 
a nd they'll probably say, 
"Drop dead!" 

rt 's not that other classes 
are more interest ing, but 
tudents find verb drills 

tedious and language teachers 
boring, if not eccentri . And if 
you study under a native 
speaker of, say, French, 
they're likely to worship 
croissa nt s more than 
conjugation. 

Meanwhile, language lab i ' 
the pits. Most college friends 
spent their lab hour sleeping 
off hangover . And those lab 
workbooks! They 're filled 
with convers ation you ' ll 
never have: 

"Good day, Pierre. Ha ve you 
been to the zoo?" 

"No, Marie , not today." 
Who need s this? America -

and English - "rule the 
world ," right? Why bother 
with the "subjunctive mood" 
when surveys show so few 
Americans ever travel abroad? 

Language requirements 
only e ncourage career· 
conscious students to cheat on 
tests and despise something 
that could be fun. 

Educators have been 
struggling to overcome 
America's aversion to foreign 
language stud y for yea r s. The 
debate intensified last year 
after a presidential commis· 
sian reported that only 8 
percent of America's colleges 
required foreign langu age 
competency for graduat ion . 

Rep. Paul Simon (D·IlI. ) held 
hearings lastJuly on a bill that 
wo uld encourage foreign 
language ins truct ion in the

United States. His plan would 
cost money, but cou ld win 
s upporters of all s tripes. 
Simon believes that foreign 
language proficiency would be 
the best educational contribu· 
tion to our national ecurity 
since Sputnik woke us up, and 
would help business overseas 
as well. 

"We should erect a s ign at 
each point of entry into the 
United States; 'Welcome to the 
US - we cannot speak your 
language,'" wri te Simon in 
his recent book, The Tongue· 
Tied At11ericall: Confronting 
the Foreign Language Crisis. 
He adds, "The question is not 
one of national resources . The 
question is one of national 
will. .. 

Simon 's bill. aptly called the

Education Department to give 
schools and colleges $30 for

also receive grants for tarting 
programs. 

Bu t, Mr. Simon, your plan

s ufficient incentive. 

To begin with, elementary 
school t udents hould be 
familiarized with a number of 
languages w hen the ubject i 
fre s h , unexpl o red and 
unpressured . At seven, kids 
can learn the basics and 
overcome their fears before the 
serious work begins. The best 
incentive that can be offered to 
young students is to make 
languages fun to learn .

done to attract young people to

AWACS Sale: another Gulf of Tonkin 
BYFRANZSCHURMANN 

Pacific News Service 
President Reagan's recent 

commitment to defend Saudi 
Arabia against all external and 
internal attack has turned 
the debate over AWACS into a 
Middle East version of the 
Gulf of Tonkin re olution 17 
years ago. 

For the first nine months of 
the Johnson administration, 
world tensions were mounting 
in the Tonkin Gulf region of 
Vietnam and the United States 
was being drawn in. For the 
first nine months of the 
Reagan adminstration the 
same has been happening in 
the Persian Gulf region. 
President Johnson argued that 
vital US interests were at 
stake, and now President 
Reagan argues likewise. 

But if US interests never 
were all that clear in the Far 
East, in the Middle East they 
are ~ystal clear: Saudi Arabia 
is not only the world 's greatest 
source of exported oil, but the 
magnitude of its production 
has enabled the Saudis to 
cont:ol and hold down the 
world price of oil. Thus, one 
might say that the president's 
entire economic program is 
hostage to who holds power in 
the Saudi capital. The 
president now has vowed that 
the L'nited tates nevcr will 
allow the Saudi ruling dynasty 
to be overthrown as the shah 
was in Iran. 

W hat is &1 v i n g the 
president's remarks a note of 
urgency is the growing 
evidence that events in and 
affecting Iran are coming to 
the most decisive turning 
point since the Islamic 
revolution. Opponents of the 

ayatollah, notably ousted 
President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr, are convinced that the 
Teheran regime is about to 
fall. Yet at the same time the 
Islamic regime, despite the 
unbelievable 10 s of leader 
during the last month, show 
few signs of collapse. Foreign 
ob ervers till believe that the 
population as a whole support 
the regime. 

But an alarming trend has 
been the reheating of the war 
with Iraq. With no correspon-
dents to report on either side, 
there is little public knowledge 
of what actually is going on. 
Iraq has admitted to a retreat 
from the territory it held north 
of the Karun River, and both 
sides claim heavy casualties 
inflicted on the other. 
However, much more alarm-
ing is the apparent resumption 
of attacks by the Iranian on 
Iraqi oil fields. 

Either way the war 
proceeds, the peace and 
stability of all the Middle East 
could be gravely threatened. If 
Iran falls apart , there could be 
a scramble for power, with a 
good chance that the United 
States and ,the Soviet Union 
would be directly drawn in. If 
Iran holds together and the 
war wor 'ens, it could spell 
extreme danger for Iraq 's 
dictator, Saddam Hussein . 
When the Iran-Iraq war broke 
out, audi Arabia and jordan 
made a pledge to addam 
Hus ein simi lar to the one 
President Reagan made to the 
Saudi royal family. What will 
they do if the Iraqi dictator 
should fall and a regime 
representa tive of Iran ' 
majority Shi 'a Arab popula· 

tion comes to power in 
Baghdad? 

The success of the 
president's policy to restore 
health to the American 
economy depend on peace in 
the Middle East. If his 
economic plan finally takes 
hold, then the United States, 
as the locomotive of the world 
economy, will stimulate a 
wider economic recovery. 
That will mean a rise in the 
demand for oil from the 
present slump. If peace and the 
status quo prevail , the Saudis 
will be able to manipulate 
OPEC production to keep 
prices stable. Stable oil and 
food prices and a money su pply 
kept in check are the three 
foundat ions of Reagani te 
economic recovery, But if an 
even wider war engulfs the 
Middle East, that would mean 
raging inflation along with a 
deep slump - in short, the 
crash in the world economy so 
many leaders have feared . 

The president's thinly veil-
ed warning to Israel regarding 
the AWACS sale to the Saudis 
can easily be translated as an 
accusation that it and its 
friends in the United States 
are helping bring about 
another conflagration in the 
Middle East and another 
"Iran" in audi Arabia . 

I rael has no interest in any 
peace and stabi lit y in the 
Middle Ea ·t that does not go 
through the Camp David 
proce ' and thus involve Israel 
directly. It also has not made 
any ecret of it preference for 
an Iranian victory in the war. 
Many I raeli believe that a 
Saudi Arabia torn by 
revolutionary turmoil would 
be preferable to a powerful

Saudi Arabia which could 
become the leader of the Arab 
world. 

Pro-I raeli sentiment is the 
mo t powerful factor in 
opposition to the A WACS sale 
in the US Senate. Yet there 
also is the fear of again getting 
involved in a foreign conflict as 
we did in Indochina. In this 
en e the AWACS issue is a lot 

like the Gulf of Tonkin 
re olution formally submitted 
to the Senate by President 
johnson. Approving the sale 
would amount to a tacit signal 
to the president to go ahead, 
even with military forces, to 
protect US oil· related interests 
in the region, Rejecting it 
would be a no-confidence vote 
in the president's Middle 
Eastern policies, 

What we are beginning to 
see more and more clearly in 
the A WACS debate are the 
three dominant lines of foreign 
policy thinking that recently 
have emerged in the United 
States. There is neo · 
isolationist sentiment that 
developed over the Indochina 
war and continues today in 
oppo ition to dependency on 
foreign sources of oil. There is 
the nco-con ervative line that 
holds tliat t h on I y \\ ay to keep 

the oil lifeline open is to deploy 
military power in the region 
and rely on countries that are 
stable and friendly to the 
United tates, notably Israel 
and then Egypt. And then 
there is the official line which 
has evolved over the last 
decades which holds that in 
the end there is no su bstitute 
for complex political arrange· 
ments among the power 
involved. That has taken the 
form of a new alliance policy 
that knits China, Pakistan, 
Saudi Arabia and Egypt along 
with the older NATO powers

AS votes-to boycott 'inauguration 
Council urges students to join them in the protest 

BY PAUL FARWELL 
Siall Wril er 

Chancellor Richard At kin-
:on will be formally 
inaugurated this month, bLit 
AS council members will not 
attend the ceremonie '. 

At a council meeting last 
Wednesdav, the ASUCSD 
voted 11 :3 in favor of 
boycotting the inauguration to 
protest the decision making 
pro ce ' whi ch br ought 
Atkinson to this campus. 

Eyer since Atki n:>on was 
chosen in April, 1980, A ' 
cou ncil have complained that 
the opinions of UC ' 0 5t udents 
were not considered in the 
final deci ·ion. 

" We haven't forgotten that 
we were left out of any 
meaningful role in the 

L.ONGSNO~( 
T"'NSPOU 

rlllEt 
1£& 1: 104 

selection of our chancellor," 
said A pr es id en t Jule s 
Bagneris. "What we're doing 
with the boycott is 'aying to 
(University President David) 
Saxon: We don't like the 
manner that you handled the 
whole proces '. You didn't give 
the students enough input," 
he added . 
A n 'atrocious' selection 
process 

When a search committee, 
headed by Pre ident Saxon 
re viewed candidate for 
chancellor two years ago, only 
two UCSD students were 
invoh'ed in t he process. Linda 
Sabo, one of those two 
tudent, aid, "The proce 's 

wasn't real good and the 
ending was atrocious," But. 
she added, "When people 

stand up (10 the AS) and say 
th ere wa s no studcnt 
representa ti on, thi isn't 
ent irely accurate. What we 
wanted was for the candidates 
- 'lay three finali sts - to 
come to campus and for a 
bunch of us (student ) to meet 
them and a 'k them questions 
and for us to have an input in 
the final decision ." 

Instead of ·several candi-
dates coming to campus, on ly 
one did - Richard Atkinson. 

"We could have made a 
stink about it, if we really 
didn't like him (Atkin ·on). But 
there was nothing like: 'Here 
are three people, who do you 
like?' That part wa 'crewcd 
up," said Sabo. 

Sabo speculate that the 
searc h committee dldn't 

announce the name" of the 
candidat e~ publically lx.'Cau~e 
pubhcity wou ld have pu the 
candidat e. ' job" 10 jeopard) . 

Jo~ ce jU'itus, A_sIstan t \ 'ice 
Chancellor, who last year was 
a candidate for Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs said students were not 
the onlv one: left out of the 
select ion proces.. "A. a 
faculty per 'on I had probably 
il!> much input in the deci-;ion 
mak ing process as a ,t udent 
had . The faculty memb r!> in 
the committee dldn't 
pubhcally consult with faculty 
mt'mbers on campuo.,," said 
Ju tus. 

Pam Gerber, AS Comml'>' 
' ioner of External Relation , 
said "How can the uni"eritv 
administration make a 

de<.'l~:ol1 abclut 'iomething that 
affect student" so much, and 
not take student mput into 
l'on-.lderation?" 
Effects of the b(l~'cott 

How will the - university 
administration react to the 
boycott? Will i haveanyeffect 
on President axon? 

"If it's ju t a boycott 
v.. ithollt a demon!>tration - if 
people ju"t don't show up - it 
will pretty much of a non· 
reaction from the university," 
said Sabo. 

About the Oct. 22 inaugura· 
tlOn Sabo added. "I will bet no 
one \\ ill stand up and !:oay: 'I 
not Ice that the A ' Isn't here. 
Will '>omeone plea e explam 
thi to me.' But If you ha\'e a 
pre - relea e or you have a 
pokes person who will explain 

why you're boYCOttlO~ then It 
will make an impact. ' 

Cranston visits Del Mar; 
talks on coastal issues 

The AS council does, in fact, 
plan to send a spoke person to 
the inauguration. 

However, Reggie Williams, 
AS Commissioner of Student 
Welfare, believes that simply 
not attending the inaugura-
tion ceremonies will be 
effective in itself. "When 
you're invited to an inaugura-
tion, you're invited to add 
legitimacy to the whole 
function . From the chancel-
lor ' 'POint of vie\\ he needs 
that ," said William". Wtlliams 
added that high level 
univer. IIY officials uch a 
RegenL and Over"eers will be 
at tendlOg the mauguration.

Sen. Alan Cranston (0-
Calif) was in town Friday, 
surveying North County's 
eroding coastline and li stening 
to t he concerns of local 
government officials, busines 
leaders and residents. 

Cranston's day began in 
Oceanside with an aftrrnoon 
meeting of t he city council 
there and ended with an 
evening public forum in Del 
Mar's Seagrove Park. 

In bet ween, Cranston took a 
ride down the North County 
coast on one of NCTD 's new 
wheel -chair equipped bus . 
During the trip, North County 
Transit officials, a spoke man 
for the Air Pollution Control 
District and cientists from 
Scripp In stitution of 
Oceanography talked to 

Cranston and other passen-
gers about problems threaten· 
ing North County land and 
inhabitants. 

And Cranston could not 
resist the opportunity for a 
brisk run along the beach. The 
avid runner set out for a fi'-e-
mile jog down the Del Mar 
coa~t v.. ith city counCilmen 
and t he vice-mayor while the 
press and bewildered 
neighbors looked on. 

At a reception after hi s run, 
Cranston "pre!>sed the flesh" 
wit h more loca l leaders. He 
also answered severa l 
questions about impending 
budget cuts to ·tudent 
financial aid. 

"The main battle is to keep' 
them from cutting more,' 
Cranston said . "We're lighting

"If we see enough student 
interest. a task force will be 
established to look into these 
matters," said Dye. 

Unti l then, the fraternities 
and sororities must continue 
to register as tudent 
organizations. 

Joshua Harri , President of 
Phi Delta , seems to think that 
Dye's fears may be unfounded. 

"Fraternities here will be 
nothing like the ones at (Sa n 
Diego) State," said Harris, 
"Just by the nature of the 
school. " 

He believes that fraternities 
wi ll do nothing but improve 
the campus. Socially, for 
instance. he says that Phi 
Delta will give people the 
opportunity to meet others 
from all parts of the school. 

More specifically, he said, "In 
about three weeks we will be 
having a big party, it will be 
our first all·campus event." 

Dennis Perry, Director of 
Chapter Development for 
TKE, has similar ambitions. 

"I hope to build a good 
fraternity that will include all 
fou r colleges," he said. 

He added that member. 
would not be labeled Muir or 
Third students, but would 
simply be people who are 
proud of the fact that they are 
UCSD student . 

Roland E. Buck, Student 
Center Director, agrees that a 
Greek sys t em would do 
nothing but add to the range of 
'oe ial activities and offer 
students addit ional options. 

For this reason, he said, the

system might improve the

increased ease in traveling by 
bus. In separate letters to the 
San Diego Transit board of 
directors, Gotch and Golding 

cited that the half-hour policy, 
which has been in effect s ince 
July, was working a hardship 
on bus riders, particularly 
sen ior citizens. 

According to San Diego 
Tran si t general manager 
Roger Snol)le. "From 1972 
until last July, we allowed 
three hours for transfers, and 
people were able to get off the 
bus, shop or do bu 's iness, and 
then reboard then reboard the 
same bus going in the same 
direction.

attrition rate which has been a 
problem for years at UCSD. 

Perry offered some numbers 
to support this conclusion. 

"The chance of graduating 
go up 10 percent when you join 
a fraternity," he said. 

Dye admitted that this was a 
possibility. He also said that 
there wa a chance that a 
Greek system might attract 
·tudents to UCSD. 

Another problem which a 
Greek ystem might help 
resolve is the housing 
shortage. At some colleges 
over half of the student body 
resides in fraternity and 
sorority houses. 

According to Woodard , 
when the campu plans were 
layed out 25 years ago, the area 
leadi ng out from Central 
Library towards Genesee wa 
considered a a possible ite 
for a future "frat row." Now 
that ha all changed. 

There may be ot her 
pos ibilit ies however. 

"There are everal areas on 
campus 'et a ide for student 
housing." said Senior Campus 
Planner, Beverly uckles . 
"When someone come ' up 
with a specific suggestion for 
building a fraternity or 
sorority house we will 
consider it at that time." [f a 
frat row does develop, 
according to Harri ,it won't be 
in the near future, perhaps not 
for five years. 

The establishment of a 
Greek system might prove 
beneficial to the community as 
well a to the school.

involved with," said Gilbert. 
She feels that thi ' volunteer 
work is one of the most 
important functions of the 
sororitie '. 

Harri s has plans for Phi 
Della to work closely with the 
youth of La Jolla. 

But a major concern of some 
might be the negative effect a 
Greek system might have on 
the academic atmosphere. 

On the other hand three are 
those who might agree With 
Harris , who belIeves that 
academics would improve 

" He explained that Ph i 
Delta's Big Brother Program 
will insure that new members 
keep up their grades. 

"I think t here are a lot of 
people on campu~ who wl'ih 
they \vould haw had someone 
\\ atching ()\'er their frbhman 
ear," he added. 
Dye said that academiCS 

would not neccssanh be 
affected . He pointf'Ci out that 
many top academic schools 
ha vc strong Greek systems. He 
also :aid that mam fraterm· 
tie have mmim'um GPA 
r eq u ire men t s f () r n e \\ 
member . 

Another concern might be a 
financial one. Although Harris 
says that fraternity funds are 
generated mternally, umver· 
ity money would probably be 

needed to hire a Greek ad\'i or 
and al 0 for office space. 

But according to Gilbert, the 
services a Greek system could 
provide would more than pay 
for the funds it would require. 

Harri and Perry agree that 

the future of fraternities and 
sororities depends on the 
succes", of the fir t organiza· 
tions to establish themselve~. 
They both ~aid they hope to 
correct misgivings about 
fraternity life.

meets every Thursday. 7pm, Revelle 
Informal Lounge. The Club shows movies, 
talks about science fiction, puts out 
regular newsletters and is in the process of 
putting together science fielion short

In order to fully establish KSDT as a viable 
orrcampus media the AS CounCil has 
established a Task Force to investigate 
different methods for broadcasting on the 
UCSD campus and surrounding 
communities. Four alternatives were 
proposed by the Task Force: 

First. the improvement of the AM carrier 
current which Is In service now. The carrier 
current availab;e on Revelle and Muir 
campuses has onty limited efficiency, 
hampered by the fluorescent lights and 
ceiling mounted heating coils. 

The second alternative would be the 
Installation of a closed-loop antenna. This 
system. similar to that employed at Los 
Angeles International Airport, consists of a 
series of clover-leaf antennas buried in the 
ground Estimates are yet to be 
completed but preliminary reports 
indicate thiS to be cost prohibitive. 

The third alternallvewould be connecting 
individual buildings to a campus-wide 
cable system. This method appears to be 
the least desirable as it would necessitate 
connecting each individual receiver to 
the cable 

The ASUCSD Bulletin is published each

Male contraceptive explored 

By LESLIE FOOT 

The development of a safe. reliable and 
practical male contraceptive has been a long 
and arduous task. For many decades the male 
has had very limited choice when it came to 
practicing any type of birth control. There was 
nothing as sophisticated as the female oral 
contraceptive. However. with the wide pread 
intere t in better form of birth control and 
sharing of re ponsibility, researchers are now 
intently studying the possibility of a "pill" for 
men. 

The reasons for delay are not just social. 
Numerous obstacle are encountered in trying 
to understand the mechanisms of male 
hormone action. A contraceptive. when 
developed. must not only be efficient and 
reliable, but it must be free of side effects. 

Among the problems faced are the effects of 
altering the level of testosterone, the male sex 
hormone. Tampering with the hormonal 
balance of the male could cause an alteration in 
the male secondary sexual characteri tics and 
libido which are dependent upon testosterone. 
These side effects would make any pill hard to 
swallow. 

In addition, re earchers have had a difficult 
time finding an appropriate target for 
hormonal regulation. Hormone levels in the 
male are rather constant, while female 
hormone secretions vary cyclically. The rise in 
female hormone secretion preceeding 
ovulation (rupture of egg into fallopian tubes) 
is a convenient point of control. 

Recently, an article in the New Eng/and 
Journal of Medicine described the efforts of 
researchers working with LHRH agonists . 
LHRH (leutinizing hormone releasing 
hormone) is a ten amino acid compound that 
has been recently isolated from a region of the 
brain called the hypothalmus, Its secretion 
causes a neighboring organ, the pituitary 
gland. to secrete other hormones called FSH 
(follicle stimulating hormone) and LH 
(leutinizing hormone). In the testes, FSH 
induces production of sperm while LH prompts 
the production of testosterone, But LHRH doe 
not neces arily have to work through the 
pituitary gland. A very unexpected observation 
was that LHRH had a direct influence on 
spermatogenesis (sperm development) and 
testosterone synthes is in the testes. There 
were two hypotheses. One was that the LHRH 
receptors were evolutionary remnants. The 
other was that perhaps the teste ' secrete their 
own form of LHRH. 

What the researchers did was create an 
LHRH agonist. An agonist is a compound 
similar to the original hormone but its potency 
is much greater. When this agonist is 
administered it acts not to increase LH and 
FSH secretion but rather to desensitize 
receptors in the pituitary gland and very likely 
in the testes as well. This paradoxical effect is 
not completely understood. Spermatogenesis 
and testo ·terone levels. as a result, drop 
because no FSH or LH can be ecreted by the 
pituitary gland . 

This agonist was tested on nine male 
~ ubjects. They w r given the LHRH agoni s t 
regularly and their testo ·terone levels and 
sperm count were observed over a period of 
time. The levels of testosterone dropped to 
below normal by the eighth week. Likewise. 
perm count dropped drastically. The level of 

FSH and LH were al 0 ob erved to drop, 
indicating that the pituitary gland had been 
desensitized . When administration of the 
agonist was stopped. the hormone levels 
returned to normal. although a "rebound" 
effect was observed. During this period, 
hormone levels were far greater than normal 
but soon returned to their original levels. 
Sperm density recovery took a little longer 
because of the two months necessary for 
perm production . 

Although this may seem one step away from 
the real thing, improvements are needed. A few 
of the subjects had to stop treatment because of 
impotence. This condition ended two weeks 
after they stopped receiving the agonist. Other 
ubjects also reported heat flashes. 
There is also the concern regarding 

sustained desensitization of the pituitary 
gland. What is the effect of desensitization in 
the long run? Also, the depressed testosterone 
levels could not make this form of the 
contraceptive acceptable. Extended periods of 
depressed levels would effect libido and 
secondary sexual characteristics. I t is possible. 
however, to administer the agonist with 
'upplementary testo terone to re tore 
testosterone level in the bloodstream. Only 
s permatogenesis would be effectively 
suppre 'sed this way. 

There ti ll remains a great deal of work to 
done in perfecting a contraceptive that will be 
widely accepted . Our outlook on birth control 
has changed and will change further with such 
a contraceptive.

Extension expeditions Summer at NIH 
An expedition to the 

Mexica n tropics, a study of 
the cultural traditions "I of 
Indic c"ivi li zations, and whale 
watching from aboard ship 
and onshore will be the 
features of three UCSD 
Extension study tours for the 
public . 

Study tours spon:ored by 
UC D Extension offer 
participants both the 
adventure of travel and the 
opportunity to study 
countries, cultures and 
inhabitants with experienced 
educators. 

The study tour "An 
Expedition to t he Tropic ." ib 
sc heduled · for Nov . 30 
through Dec. 6 and i . a we k· 
long natural his tory sea 
voyage to isolated tropical 
ba ys, bea c he s, river 
channels, remote fishing 
village ' and islands in 
western Mexico. 

The program offers 
part icipants a chance to 
observe, photograph , and 
experience the coco nut 
palms, orchids, bromeliads 
and other lu~h vegetation, as 
well as the rich birdlife 
including boobies , frigate 
birds , the mot-mot, trogons 
and terns of the Mexican 
state of Nayarit. The fee is 
$795. 

Scheduled for jan . 30 
through Feb. 7 will be the 
whale watching study tour, 
which is titled "California 
Gray Whale." In its ninth 
year at UCSD Extension, this 
field ·t udy tour is conducted 

aboard ship and onshore, and 
includes exploration of some 
of the mo t beautiful wild 
place ' in North America , 
including San Martin and 
Cedros Islands, the an 
Benito ' Islands, Isla Todos 
Santos, and San ' Ignacio 
Lagoon . 

The 95· foot "Searcher" 
travels primarily at night, 
with daily excursions on each 
of the i"land '. A high light of 
the night travel is the 
opportunity to observe 
common and Pacific white· 
sided dolphins through the 
bioluminescenceof the ocean. 
Led by biologists Larry ]. 
Hobbs and Ron Le Valley, 
this study tour co ·t · $795, 
not including airfare. 

Two San Diego county 
residents wi ll le ad a n 
Extension study tour Dec. 19· 
Jan. 16 to 'ome of the most 
beautiful areas of ub· 
tropical 'outhern Asia. 

Different from the u 'ual 
travel agency tours to Asia, 
this trip features Professor 
Willard John son and Mrs. 
Su sa n Chamberlain as 
leaders for a tour to out-of-
the-way areas of Tamilnadu 
(old Madras State) in south 
India , and then on to Sri 
Lanka (old Ceylon), the 
s plendid isle of gems and 
Buddhist monuments. 

"In this way," says 
Johnson, "we wi ll be able to 
observe at close range and 
con trast the two great 
religion ' of lndie civilization, 
Hinduism in Tamilnadu and 

Buddhism of the Theravada 
variety in Sri Lanka. 

"They are very different 
religions, yet exist in close 
geographica l proximity 
which wi ll give us a fantastic 
oporlunity to under ·tand the 
two great strea ms of I ndic 
spirituality," j ohn 'on says. 

Chamberlain. a world 
traveller and tour leader for 
more than 20 years, noted 
that this study tour will "not 
just go rapidly through the 
big cities, as most tours do, 
picking a few highpoints and 
really missing the details and 
the meaning of the experi· 
ence of travelling to such 
areas. VVe go into the 
country ' ide, to rarely vi 'ited 
places of special importance, 
tryi ng to find t he local 
festivals, the livi ng temples, 
the centers of dance and s till 
living crafts and culture. 
Many of these, with the 
sweep of change and 
modernization, are fast 
disappearing. " 

Their winter UCSD 
Extension study tour is titled 
"The Glorious Orient : India, 
Sri Lanka and Singapore -
Dec. 19, 1981·Jan. ]6,1982. " 

The fee for the ·tudy tour 
is $3 ,540, including escort,' 
visa fees, airport taxes, 
airfare and lodging. For more

has gi ven me a greater 
appreciation of Chemistry and 
why it is necessary. I was able 
to work with Dr. Constanta-
poulos on a project which lead 
to my learning about a disease 
called Muccopolysacchari · 
doses, which is a heritable 
metabolic storage di sease 
caused by an enzyme 
deficiency which allows 
particular glyco aminglycans 
to build up in and deteriorate 
different areas of the brain. 
The project we worked on 
involved two patients, siblings 
who exhibited ymptoms 
of Muccopolysaccharido 'es. 
However, our research showed 
that the glycosaminoglycans 
present were in normal 

amounts. What we did find 
was that these children 
exhibited another su bstance 
which was not a common 
element in Muccopolysaccha-
ridoses. 

This work will hopefully be 
. published sometime in the 
comi ng year. In addition to 
laboratory research, I was 
g iven the opportunity to 
obtain c linical exposure 
through going on rounds, and 
learning to do patien t histories 
and physicals. The kinds of 
diseases and people that I saw 
has had a great impact on how 
I view the field of medicine and 
also how I veiw life. 

There are other educational 
programs at NIH. The Clinical 
Electives Program allows 
third year medical students to 
do clinical electives at NIH. 
The Clinical Associates 
program is for people who have 
completed two years of a 
residency program and can go 
to NTH as a Clinical Associate 
and work in the area of their 
choice. There are also Post· 
Doctoral and Staff Fellow 
positions. In order to make 
more information available,

The program provides one 
month of training in Indian 
languages and backgrou nd 
instruction on the su beon li-
nent 's civilization. Also 
included are round-trip air 
fare , medical care, a living 
allowance and research· 
related travel expenses.

John Klemtner dazzles crowd 
with old and n ew jazz styles 

BY TIM AUGUST 
John Klemmer has been 

called "the most important 
white jazz musi c ian in 
America ,. and hi . performance 
Saturday night at USD's 
Camino Theater certainly 
added credibility to that 

~tatement. 
Backed by an exceptionally 

tight band, Klemmer provided 
a dazzling display of virt uosity 
on the tenor sax. Hi rhyt hm 
sect ion, most notably bassist 
David William s and the 
newest member of the band, 
multi·percussionist Efram 
Toro made for an excellent 
backdrop to Klemmer 's 
fantastic horn playing . 
Kevboardist Russell Ferat e 
also contributed several very 
admirable solos as well as a 
good melodic counterpart to 
Klemmer's phenomenal style. 

Klemmer opened his 75 
minute et with the title tack 
of hi s new album Hush. He 
soon had the audience 
captivated with a dreamlike 
solo modified by an echoplex (a 
tape delay device), which has 
long been a Kl emmer 
trademark. 

At one point in the show, 
Klemmer played a m'bira (an 
obscure african instrument) 
through the echoplex. creating 
a complex layered rhythm, 

where he then began to play 
hi s sax simu ltaneously with 
the m'bira contributing to a 
mind·bending effect. He then 
stepped away from the mic and 
wal ked to the front of t he s tage 
to fill the hall. unamplified . 
with a wai ling , almo'[ 
maniacal solo that had mo ·t of 
the audience gaping blankl y at 
his sheer brilliance with the 
instrument. 

The concert focused mostly 
on Klemmer' . newer material 
inel uding some of hi s better 

concerts 

known songs "Heart" and 
"Taboo," a well as a few of his 
old standards. 

Although he only returned 
for one encore. the crowd was 
not disappointed in his all 
around dynamic performance. 

Even though John Klemmer 
tu rned in an exceptional set , 
the opening band, featuring 
sou l singer Carl Anderson, 
a lso gave an in ' piring 
performance. Anderso n' 
capt ivating, energet ic. and 
highly expressive singing had 
the audience clapping, inging 
along and even 'creaming for 
more at the end of his et . 

An Evening of 
Pinter an 

Backed by the Gerry 
Manfredi Band, Anderson's 
mu s ic delved into soulful 
ballads, reggae, funk. R&B , 
and some tas ty rock. They 
opened t heir hour-long s t 
with a lat in tinged rock 
instrumental replete with 
superb indi\' idual solo~ . 

Guitari st Charle~ John~on 
wowed the audience with 
incredible 'io los and duets with 
Anderson's vocals, particular· 
lyon John son 's rock-edged 
song "Drive All Night." 

A funk·rock tune by bassist 
Manfredi, "If (There's Room 
At the Top I Want To Be 
There"), feat ured Santana like 
guitar riffs as well as highly 
energet ic vocals by Anderson. 

Although they only had time 
for one encore, the band 
returned to a standingo\,ation 
to do poss ibly their best 
number of the night. ., ilver 
City" was an exuberantly 
funky tune that s howed 
Ander on to hi s best 
advantage. 

The energy level attained by 
Anderson's band left man y in 
the audience doubtful that 
Klemmer could surpa 's it. But 
Klemmer did provide a great 
performance, and in addition 
to Anderson' s opening set, the 
evening was unqu : tionably 
beyond all expectations .

Tokyo String Quartet praised Filmex '81 
BY GORDON HOWARD 

The Tokyo String Quartet, acclaimed 
as one of the best quartets in the world, 
lived up to its reputation last Saturday 
with an excellent performance before a 
full hou e in the Mandeville Auditorium. 
The group's technique triumphed over 
excellent and difficult quartets by Mozart 
and Schubert, along with a lackluster 
modern piece by Japanese composer Toru 
Takemit u. 

bowing. Above all the music must be 
played in moderation, without the 
towering heights and sunken depths 
needed to play the music of later romantic 
composers. The Tokyo group handled 
this problem with the aplomb befitting 
their world status, playing the Quartet 
flawlessly and with the needed 
craftmanship. 

The next piece played was "A way a 
lone". by Japanese composer Takemit u. 
The title comes from a line in James 
Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, the substance of 
which is an apt analogy to the content of 
thi s composition. The playing brought to 
mind the work of Alban Berg, and the 
outraged riots in early 20th century 
Vienna concert houses which were 
provoked by their playing. The opening 
lines sounded much like an out·of·wne 
accordion , and the rest of the piece had all 
the artistry of a migraine headache, 
giving the listener a cramped and stuffy 
feeling. 

Given the excellence of the group's 
playing during the rest of the program, 
and the comment in the program notes 
that the heavily notated score left no 
room for improvisation, one cannot blame 
them for playing poorly. The blame that 
they can shoulder involves including this 
piece on the program. 

Intermission was followed by 
Schubert's Quartet No. 14 in D minor. 
Schubert wrote this piece forty years 
after Mozart had written his Quartet No. 
21, but the time interval was one of the 
most important in musical history, as the 
intervening years had been the province 
of one Ludwig von Beethoven. This piece 
from its opening chords is lodged firmly 
in the po t·Beethoven romantic era. The 
group played the piece with the gusto and 
sweep it needed, having problems only 
with the first violin part in the first 
movement. The highlight came in a 
beautifully-played cello-viola duet in the 

Films are now being 
accepted for the 1982 Los 
Angeles International Film 
Exposition (Filmex). Garry 
Essert, Filmex Director , 
today announced that the 
Selection Committee will 
consider a broad spectrum 
of productions for the 
annual Exposition to be 
held March 17-April 2, 
1982, at Plitt Century Plaza 
Theatre in Century City. 
Filmex 82 will include 
features, documentaries, 
shorts, animation, st udcn t 
work . experimental and 
Super-8mm films. 

The program began with Mozart 's 
Quartet No. 21 in D Major, written during 
the composer's mos t trying time 
personally. However as is usual none of 
Mozart's moods at this time are reflected 
in the Quartet, which has a plethora oft he 
gentle and sprightly melodies and 
accompaniments abundant in all of his 
work. 

Mozart 's music may not require the 
pyrotechnic displays prevalent in the 
score of other composers, but instead it 
requires an unusually high level of 
attention paid to details of intonation and

Harness Racing Returns To Del Mar 
In a little Ie s than three 

weeks - Wednesday, October 
2Hth to be exact - the Del Mar 
racetrack wlil comc alive with 
I he color . exci tement and 
action of the area'" newe:t 
sport. Harness racing ret urn" 
to the San Diego sports scene 
after a three decade absence. 

The beauty and grace of 
trotters and pacers around the 
hi storic Del Mar racetrack 
afford spectators the chance to 
catch some glorious breath-
taking sport action and art. 
The backstretch colony of 
horses and humans will 
number into the thousands. 

The last major harness 
racing meet at Del Mar was 
back in 1949. A lot has changed 
ince then. John McGregor, 

president of Del Mar Harnes , 
expects the richest season ever 
to hit the turf in 1981. The 
richest horse race in the world 
is for harness hor es, and of 
the top ten money-winning 
racehorses this year, six are 
harness horses. 

Another interesting side-

lIght to harnes - racing i!-o In the 
size of the driver. Possibly 
you've heard all the stories of 
thoroughbred jockies starving 
themi'>elves to meet a good 
weight for riding. Harness 
rider. on the other hand . mav 
surprise you with their weigh"t 
and sIze (many times tipping 
t hp scales at well over two 
hundred pounds). The hor~es 
are also much larger than their 
thoroughbred cousins. 
averaging a hcfty 1000 pounds_ 

Harness horses begin every 
race behind an automobile 
with long metal wings. In ide 
the car is the official starter 
with the responsibility of 
getting every race started 
fairly. The car also stays in 
fron t of all of the horses 
throughout the race, with a 
patrol judge making sure that 
none of the rules are violated 
during the race. 

Harness racing defint ely is 
a spectator sport. It is said to 
be twice as dangerous as 
thoroughbred racing, simply 
because of the width of the 
"racing team." One of the 

legends of harncs~ racmg will 
come to the Del Mar lurf on 
November 7. " Ram bling

November showing at Del Mar 
will conclude a 21 city tour for 
the horse. 

The inaugural harness 
season is scheduled on a 
Tuesday through Saturday

days _ Each program will 
consist of nine races with a

GUIlrdian game of the week_ Payne would yell intensely to 
AA players on the whole" try to psyche up his team but 
display. more talent and they were just no match for 
better plays than single A and In Your Face. In the second 
all AA teams should look out half Face continued to score. 
in the playoffs for In Your Davenport made another

quarterback Kolk, receiver 
Ken Davenport and end Dan

13-0 halftime lead. 

Both touchdowns were 
caught by Davenport, the

expect from Charlie Joiner. 
Study Breakers did move the 
ball but had a bad break when 
an inadvertent whistle 
brought back a touchdown. 
Unfortunately after that they 
didn't do much except for a 

good defense by Walters and 
the rest of the team put the 
game away. Rodney Davis 
ended the scoring in the game 
with a touchdown catch to 
make the final score 31-0. 

Study breakers dropped to 
0-2 while In Your Face rai ed

waterpolo returns to UCSD pool to defeat 
Los Angeles in rough match, 20-8 

Cal 

By TIM PICKWE LL 
Staff Wriler 

There were enough 
mugging , elbowing, body 
blocks and ejections in 
Friday's water polo match to 
fill a hockey game. 

The rough play and short 
tempers were re ults of 
frustration felt by UC D 
players and t heir Cal tate 
University Lo: Angeles 
opponents. 

many of these talents and the 
San Diegans were forced intoa 
watery ver ' ion of trench 
warfare. 

Referee tos 'ed out 16 
swimmers during the course 
of the game. UC D coach 
Denny Harper blamed the 
jections on "heavy hands." 

At time: the area in front of 
the goal mouth resembled the 

the Golden Eagles managed to 
score. 

UCSD was up 6-3 early in 
the second quarter, wit h LA 
tenaciou sly hanging on when 
Triton Greg Buchanan staged 
a one-man polo clinic. 

He slid under a charging 
opponent at mid·pool. ~tripped 
him of the ball , drove half the 
pool . faked a defender in front 
of the goal. and though double-

steal, Buchanan confiscat ed 
another ball. and assisted a 
wide·open tephen Ecclas for 
an 8-3 advam age. 

The rout was on a, thegamc 
rapidly d terioratcd into a 
rowdy collect ion of garbage-
lime goals. There were more 
ha lf-nel so ns and bony elbows 
than legitImate d e fen : i\ 'e 
plays. and it was every man for 
hImself on offense. 

stuck in the corner with the 
ball. \Vlth nowhere to go but 
up, Crane scis or-kicked hi ' 
way out of the water, took a 
perfect a lley-oop pass from 
Loedel. twisted in midair and 
jammed t he ball in . 

With ~ix for seven shooting 
Crane led all scorers . A total ul 
nine Tritons contributed 
goals. Buchanan had four 
assists ,md Loedel and Crane 
three each. The Tritons werefru trated 

by the close confines of the 30-
meter, campus natatorium . 

The Cal State Golden Eagles 
were simply frustrated . They 
were on t he los ing end of a 20-8 
blowout. 

It was the founh straight 
San Diego victory, their record 
now approaching .500 at 6-7- \. 

Accusto'med to their new home U'ateriHg hole at the 
i'vIiramar Naval Air station, the Tritons were hemmed 
in at the campus natatorium on Friday. However, when 
all was settled UCSD came out on top 0/ CSULA. 

lmmed iately aft er the ga me, 
UCSD l oo k its L8 -point 
October scoring average and 
left for a weekend tournament 
in San Luis Obispo. The 
schedule calls for the team to 
compete against San Francis-

mount aturdav , with a 
cha ll enging game against 
powerfu I Fre<.; n o tate 
\lI1day. 

Thi afternoon's melee was 
not as pretty as most UCSD 
games. The Tritons have 
played five home conte,·t · in 
the large Miramar pool where 
they are able to exploit their 
team peed, conditioning and 
superior passing skills. The 
campu bathtub restricted

on their offense and took State

The Tritons also had the 
opportunity to tryout their 
new zone defense, and player 
Scott Allison said, "It worked 

great. We looked awe orne out

It's the same old story: you're studying Literature 
and the only hero you can think of is a sandwich. 

C'mon - give yourself a break. 
Sometimes the only way to refresh your memory and 

your bod is with food and a tall, cold glass of milk. 
Really. It's easier to face the Great White Whale when you're armed. 

Milk and a snack does it. 

theres nothing like something
