Environmental Groups Work To Color UCSD Green 
PROPOSAL: Round 
table discussion 
tonight part of week 
By Julia Kull.Made, 
Co-News EdItor 

Although most students proba-
hly don't know it, UCSD is cur-
rently in the midM of Et:o-Week. 

The Environmental Coalilion at 
UCSD and UCSD Recycling have 
joined together to ~pend thi s week 
educating students, faculty and 

~ta lf about environmental i~sue~. 
Environmental Coalition 

President Tony Barrett, a Muir 
jUnior, said he modeled Eco-Week 
after a similar, uccessful program 
at Tulane University. 

TOnight, the two organil-ations 
will lead a roundtable di~cussion 
entitled, "The Greening of UCSD." 

Recycling Coordinator Kri sta 
Henkels said ~he sent out invita-
tions to A.S. members, professors, 
environmental groups, students and 
Chancellor Roben Dynes, Henkels 

said the chancellor has not yet said 
whether he wi II attend, 

At the meeting, Ihey will discuss 
Barrett 's "Green UCSD" proposal. 

The proposal makes seven rec-
ommendations. One of the major 
ones is to create an Eco-Center on 
campus. 

The center would be run by a 
paid Eco-Coordinator who, accord-
ing to the proposal, would oversee 
an enVIronmental audit of UCSD, 
Institute pilot programs and orga-
nize volunteers. 

At:eording to Barrett, the center 
would especially benefit students 
who care ahout the environment 
but don't have the time to volunteer 
activities outSide t:ampus. 

Barrett also stressctl that the 
Eco-Center would help UCSD 
remain environmentally responsi-
ble as students graduate through the 
years. 

"We don't want to reinvent the 
wheel each time stutlents cycle in 
and out," he said. "We want to t:re-

Bursar Clears Confusion Regarding New I.D. Card 
PLANS: Students can 
pick up Triton Plus at 
the end of the month 
By Leena Shankar 
Assoc,ate News EdItor 

Though many (;ominuing SIU-
dents cry OUI in l:onfusion regard-
ing the purpose and dislribution of 
the new UCSD I.D. cards, Ihe 
Bursar's Oflice has clear-Cui rea-
sons and plans for Ihe changes. 

The cards were dislribuled to all 
new students Sept. 20 Ihrough 25. 

UCSD Bursar Howard Fisher 
revealed plans to dislribute ~ards 
to ~ontinuing students during the 
last week of O(;tober and the firsl 
week of November al a localion 
Ihat has nOI yel been decided. His 
office will notify sludents of exaci 
details Ihrough ads in the 
Guardian. 

"We were very pleased with the 
firsl phase. We had 4,000 entering 
students pick up cards. and 2,000 
continuing studenls picked up 
cards as well," he said. 

Despite the faci Ihal continuing 

studel1ls had thei r pictures laken 
last quarter, Iheir new 1.0. cards 
were not meant to be di.trihuted at 
Ihe bcginning of Ihe quaner. 
According 10 Fisher, the old I.D. 
cards arc valid until the end of Fall 
4uarter. 

"II was jusl by chance that somc 
continuing students gOI their cilrds 
bccau.e things were running so 
well, " he said. 

In order to facililale the massive 
distribulion of I.D. cards. the 
Bursar's Office will give out 
appoinlment cards with one-hour 
time slots. These appointment 
cards can be picked up in lhe morn-
ing during Ihe days of dislribution, 
and sludenls can pick up a card for 
a time slol on that day only. 

"We gi ve out the appointment 
cards for one day only bel:ause if 
we give cards on Monday, say, for 
appoinlments on Thursday, Ihen 
Ihey won ' t show up." he said. " We 
can process nearly Ihree sludents a 
minute and will probably pro(;ess 
150 siudents an hour." 

During spring quarter, over 
16.000 people - including Slu-

"All laminations and 
embossing are gone. 
And, this .. d says

at It."

dents, fat:ulty and slaff - had their 
pictures taken. Pictures will only be 
retaken if the individual requcsls 10 
do so. Since then, several new fea-
ture ' have been added 10 Ihe I. D. 
cards. 

"What we did not have al that 
lime was the AT&T calling card 
feature." Fisher said. 'The calling 
card is completely optional. bUI 
even I'm going to sign up for il 
because Ihere is no downside 10 it 
al all." 

Studenls who sign up for the 
AT&T calling card will receive a 
discounl card as well. This card is 
good for purchases ranging from 
CDs al Tower Records 10 Amlrak 
tickets.

inprovelllents over Ihe old design . 

" All laminations and emoossing

said. "The people who came up 
with the design, Meredith While 
and Yvonne MUllY. pUI a 101 of 
work into it." 

Fisher also expressed satisfac-
lion wilh the quick turn-around 
lime to produce the cards. 

"Students can come in, take 
their picture and walk out wilh 
Iheir cards in a mailer of ten min-
utes," he said. 

Fisher added that the new ~ard 
is a move toward Slicker-less I.D. 
cards. 

"There are only a couple of 
spaces on this card for stickers 
because we want to do away with 
Slickers," he sa id. "Stickers arc no

hopes 10 include banking on Ihe

"The banks wan led exclusive

one would have 10 be a member of 
Bank of America," he said. " But,

GOY. Wilson Should Sign 
Much-Needed Tuition Bill 

One can only wonder what is keeping Gov. Pete 
Wilson from signing state bill AB 1318. Under the 
measure introduc~ this past year, the first tuition-fee 
cuts in 13 years - $190 to be e)(act- would be enact-
ed for UC and CS U students duri ng the 1998-99 school 
year. In addition, per-unit fees for students at 
California's community colleges would be reduced 
from $13to$12. 

Much to the chagrin of UC students, fees increased 
134 percent between 1990 and 1995 - making it 
increasingly difficult for students (0 continue their edu-
cations, [t is time for Gov. Wilson to cut UC students, 
and other students in the California higher-education 
sysll.:m, a break, 

President Clinton wants ewry American student to 
have an equal opportunity to acquire a college educa-
tion. [f we as a society really want to make higher edu-
cation a reasonable goal, it is time for California to lead 
by e)(ample, 

[f Wilson signs lhe bill, it would be a huge step for-
ward in making college a reasonable and realistic goal 
for anyone interested in furthering their education. It is 
time, Gov. Wilson, to put your signature on the dotted 
line, 

Task Force Commended 
For Outreach Proposal 

As we enter the post-affinnative-action era, the 
Guardian commends UCSD's K-12 Outreach Ta~k 
Force for working hard all summer to creale an e)(cep-
tional plan for improving UCSD's outreach programs, 

[n July 1995, the UC Board of Regents voted to ban 
all preferences based on race or ethnicity in UC admis-
sions. SP-I first impacted the last cycle of graduate-
admissions decisions, and the results were devastating 
- especially for UCSD. 

The UCSD School of Medicine failed to admit any 
African-American or Native American applicanls. 
Admissions numbers significantly decreas~ for Latino 
and Chicano students, as well. 

These results are a[anning. What is even more wor-
risome is the effect SP-I will have on students applying 
for fall 1998, when the new rules first affect under-
graduate admissions. 

We maintain that having a diverse student body is 
very much a worthy and nt!cessary goal for the UC sys-
tem. Funhennore, we are concemt!d that UCS D -
with its already tiny population of African-American 
students - will be hit especially hard by SP-I. 

[n light of the recent backlash against affinnative 
action, we support the Outreach Task Force for devis-
ing new ways to increase the numbers of racia[-minor-
ity students on campus. 

The proposed modd school, only one of the task 
force's live recommendations, bears a striking resem-
blance to the onetime UCSD Chm1er High School. 
That proposal was killed last 'June, when the Academic 
Senate voted 362 to 293 against creating a charter 
school on campus. 

The task force's also recommended partnering with 
K-12 schools, stronger outreach and recruitment 
efforts, new faculty research positions, and expanded 
teacher education and development programs. 

1be task force's recommendations will soon go 
before the Academic Senate, Because the report pre-
sents a comprehensive outreach blueprint, a necessary 
creature in the waite of SP-I, we urge UCSD's faculty 
mcmbeB to give it their wholehearted support.

FROM DIAPERS To PULL-UPS 
To THE REAL THING, AGAIN 

COMMENTARY: Although eager to take on the 'real world,' one graduating 
senior has trepidations about leaving the pampered existence of undergraduate life 
8y OrllCe JIIIIC 
C().MBnaging Editor 

As I sat in the lecture hall, strug-
gling to extrapolate the instructor's 
poinl from the discursive spiel, which 
I should probably call a lecture (theo-
retically, anyhow), it hit me: I'm grad-
uating this year! 

The prospect of leaving this cursed 
institution measurably lightened my 
mood. Suddenly, I felt kindlier toward 
the neophyte whose voice was barely 
audible above the sound of exasperat-
ed students shufiling papers and bags, 
hufling and pufling, desperate to no 
longer witness the instructor's embar-
rassingly confused and elementary 
style, I really should stop criticizing 
the inmuctor. Who am I to condemn 
another for a task in which I probably 
would not fare much beller'! 

Plat:ated by the thought of gradua-
tion,l decided to forgive the guy in front 
of l11e for failing to shower. Besides, 
those creepy-craw lies sleeping in his 
hair did not fall onto my backpack nor 
my lap, as [ had feared all throughout 
class. And if I managed to breathe 
through my mouth, the noisome stench 
was not as offensive. But why did he 
keep picking his ear and examining lhe 
pit:ked contents'! Maybe he had an car 
infection. Okay. understandable enough 
(but he really should havc stopped nick-
ing the findings behind him after I had 
said "ahem" three times). 

I began to feel more beneficent 
toward the freshman next to me. II was 
not her fault that Volkswagen has a 
catchy commercial tune; everyone 
,ings "da-da-da," while tapping her 
platform-heeled fool' and bopping her 
head from side to side. I am sure that 
she did not intend to !lip her heavily-
moussed hair in my face after curling a 
strand or it around her linger. Oh, and 
thlt bubble-gum-popping thing'! A

nervous condition, I'm sure. 

I swallowed the bitler taste len in 
Illy mouth when a Jehovah's Witness 
practically accosted me earlier and 
called me "orientaL" Instead of storm-
ing away, I probably should have 
taken a minute to explain to her that 
the term is as disparaging as "nigger" 
is to African-Americans. 

Yes, at that moment, the world 
could do no wrong. i am on my way, I 
thought excitedly. I will receive my 
bachelor 's degrees, move to New 
York, earn my Ph.D. and actually 
begin to do whal I love - research, 
read and write (this may sound neurot-

ic to some, but it is an indescribable 
passion history butTs share). 

I sat up straighter in my chair and 
resumed taking notes with a renewed 
fervor, fueled by the prospect of grad-
uation and graduate school. (l decided 
I could probably find the instructor:S 
argument upon reviewing my notes 
later; I could dig through the layers of 
intellectual garble for the point, which 
was something, at that moment, I was 
not too sure she had.) 

I looked down at my watch to 
check the time. Then it hit me again: 
I'm graduating this year. A lump in my 
throat replaced the elation. 

My roommate had given me the 
watch on my birthday. When I gradu-
ate and move away, I will not see her 
anymore, save the occasional holiday 
and birthday when Illy down. 

She will not be there, reminding me 
to cat, anchoring me during my 
moments of sheer insanity and telling 
me to laugh when I take life too seri-
ously, 

I will no longer be there to embar-
rass her during my hyper-act ive spells, 
to tell her she cannot improve upon 
perfection, nor to scare her every 
morning when I lirst tumble out of 
bcd, looking like something from 
"Night of the Living Dead." 

When I graduate from UCSD, I 
know I will miss my profcssors, rrom 
whom I have learned so much. It will 
be hard to leave those who have been 
so kind as to set aside time from teach-
ing and researching to mentor me and 
patiently answer my importunate 
questions. It is not everyday you meet 
truly caring professors who are gen-
uinely interested in your personal and 
audemic growth a~ development; 
when you find one, it is hard to say 
good-bye.

COMMENTARY: A simple task such as recycling proves to be an extraordinarily difficult task in San Diego; attempting to 
contribute to the environmental cause actually hinders progress, wasting energy and gas to drive to the nearest facility 

RECYCLING DIWICULT IN AMERICA'S FiNEST CITY 
By Megan Klein 
Opinion Editor 

For the few of you who read the 
Guardian regularly, and the even 
fewer of you who read the opinion 
section regularly, you may remem-
ber a column I wrote last spring. 

In it, I lamented the tragedy of 
my housing si tuation. I was home-
less and desperate. It looked as 
though I was heading toward a 
school year with a sleeping bag and 
tent in hand, aiming to establish my 
own campground in the eucalyptus 
groves. 

Yet, my outdoor adventure was 
not to be. Toward the middle of 
July, I found a place to live off-
campus. At last my housing prob-
lem was solved. 

Happy to be living at an actual 
address and not the third tree up 
from Library Walk, I moved in the 
second weekend of September. 

Oh, the tragedy of moving off-
campus! 

I guess it usually is not so bad, 
but in my situation, moving in was

a bigger deal than I expected . 
You see, the people who had 

lived there previously had not 
quite moved out yet. Well. they 
thought they had, but there were 
still piles and piles of their trash 
left behind. 

The refrigerator was full of their 
unidentifiable food, the patio was 
lillered with boules, cans and 
boxes, and there was junk every-
where. 

I had expected to lind a beauti-
ful, clean apartment, throw all my 
stuff into my room and relax. 
Instead, I ended up clearing out 
someone else's mess for the next 
week. 

My roommates and I filled our 
black "City of San Diego 
Environmental Refuse Collection" 
garbage can to overnowing with 
the old food and other assorted 
trash. Then, as the good reduce-
reuse-recycle person that I am, I 
gathered up all of our cardboard, 
aluminum cans, bottles and other 
recyclable stuff into a pile to be,

recycling effort •• 
well, recycled. 

But this is when it got weird. I 
could not for the life of me find a 

"Ci ty of San Diego Environmental 
Refuse Collection" recycling bin. 
Sure there was a big black trash 
can, but not a recycling bin in 
sight. 

Perplexed, I asked my room-
mate Annie, who had li ved in San 
Diego over the summer. wh~re the 
recycl ing hin was. 1 was absolutely 
shocked to lind that the City of San 
Diego docs not supply everyone 
with recycling hins , 

Now, I would not say that I am 
gung-ho about saving the environ-
ment. Sure, I think that companies 
who pour industrial waste into 
rivers should be punishcd and peo-
ple who throw their trash out of car 
windows should be pulled over and 
ticketed. But who docsn ' t'! 

Recent efforts to save the Earth 
have influenced a lot of people. 
Doing your part has almost become 
second nature. a part of life - you 
clean the bathroom, take out the 
trash and plal.:e the recycling bins at 
the curb. 

I have been completely taken 

with this notion as well. I have 
found myself picking up someone 
else's trash at a park. I try to wn-
serve wllter and electricity to some 
extent. One summer, I cven found 
my self spray-painting "Do Not 
Dump: Drains to River" on 32 
storm drains around my city. 

None of these things seem 
unusual 10 me. I think that for the 
most part, people lind themselves 
trying to save the Earth without 
heing militant environmenlalists 
out to save cvery endangered 
species and wearing used trash 
bags as clothing. 

When most people drink Cllke, 
they usually do not simply to~s the 
can into the garbage - they throw 
it into a recyding bin. Committees 
and organizations on this campus 
have designated recycling areas for 
everything from cardboard to col-
ored glass, 

So when I lind that the city of 
San Diego, "America 's Finest 
City," docs not have a comprehen-

Latino Task Force Presents 
Findings to Berkeley Campus 
PLAN: Group 
recommends dropping 
SATs as one option 
By Rachel GoIcIbtenner 
The Daily Californian (U-Wire) 

BERKELEY, Calif. 
Concluding five years of re~ean;h 
on how to improve Lalino admi~­

~ions in the UC system, Ihe Lalino 
EligihililY Task force pre~enled il~ 
final report al a lorum TueMlay 
;afternoon. 

The task force , chaired hy 
Eugene Garcia, dean or UC 
Berkeley', Graduate School of 
Education , ha\ allracted recent 
media allentlon due 10 it~ rewm-
mendal ion to Ihe UC Board or 

Regenl~ to eliminat e Ihe 
ScllOlastic Assessment Test (SAT) 
a.'> an eligibility requirement to 
apply to the univerMty. 

Garcia addre •• ed the media 
allention at Ihe meeting. 

"II's nol the only recommenda-
tion we made," he said. "Only one 
of ahout 20 was ahout the SATs." 

However, he did highlight the 
task force's motivations and rea-
sons for opposing the SAT require-
ment. 

Protesting thai the UC admis-

sions commillee uses the SATs in 
"what we call a high-stakes, for-
mulaic manner," Garcia explained 
that Latino students frequently do 
nol take the standardiz.ed lest. 

"They're meeling every other 
requirement (for UC admission. 
eligibility), but they're not taking 
the SAT," Gan:ia said. "They can't 
even apply." 

The ta.,k force repon deter-
mined Ihat el iminating a mandato-
ry SAT requirement would 
merea,e the number of Latmo . tu-
dent. eligihle for application by 60 
percent. Overall eligibi lity for all 
ethnic group. would abo n .. e, but 
unly hy 30 percent. 

Garcia acknowledged that 
implementing the la. k force\ rec-
ommendation would decrea.e 

~electivene~s in eligihility. 
However, he argued Ihal Ihe pool 
of eligihlc applicanb would be 
more fairly selected. 

In response to the problem pre-
senled by a larger applicant pool, 
the task force's report recommend-
ed a variety of criteria by which 
the admissions commillee could 
detenmine acceptance. 

As an alternative to the SAT, 
Garcia pointed to other types of 
standardiz.ed exams like 

California's Golden Gate Exams. 
These exams would establi~h a 
uniform California curriculum that 
cou Id be assessed by the test. 

" I am againsl any tesl that i ~ 
biased." Garcia ~aid. ''I' m not 
totally against the SAT; we're just 
asking that the University of 
California take a look at the SAT, 
given its problem ... " 

He suggeMed that using an 
exa m ,uch a, the Goldcn Gale 
would produce re,ult, which arc 
Ie,s differential aL:ros~ racial and 
cthnic lincs. 

One audience memher, Rachel 
Moran, a profes\or at the Boalt 
Schuol of Law ami a fonm:r 
mcmher of the ta~k force. chal -
Icnged Garcia on thi .. pOI nl. 
Moran pointed to existing raCial 
and ethniC disparities In thc ew 
York St ate Regents ' Exam,. a 
tesli ng system similar to Ihc 
Golden Gate Exams. 

"The competency tests them-
selves mighl very well lead to 
racial and ethnic disparities in out -
come," Moran said. " Presumably, 
one would wanlto get some sort of 
validity data on the competency of 
these lests (before substituting 
them for the SATs in admissions 
criteria)."

Story by Ilona Pass, Co-Hiatus Editor 

Greyboy AI/stars Get In Gear Page 19 

II! mos' successful musical in his--I ~ry, i.e. the longest running, 
Andrew Lloyd Weber's "Cats" does 
for theater what caffeine does for 
coffee: It picks you up and makes 
you feel good. 

While most people have heard of 
"Cats," almost nobody knows what 
it is about. Admittedly, the plot line 
is a bit thin: Every year the Jellicle 
Cats gather under the Jellicle moon 
in order for Iheir leader, 
Deuteronomy, to choose a 1ellicle 
Cat to come back for a new 1ellicle 
life. lust what that new life enlails is 
never fully explained. 

The place where "Cats" excels is 
the complex and non-stop dancing 
in which the cast of 21 dancers leap 
and twirl with moves that scoff at 
tbe face of gravity and laugh at the 
slightest notion of fatigue. Gillian 
Lynne choreographs the moves with 
an impeccable sense of riming and a 
mastery of the spatial possibilities 
of the stage . 

Slinking on stage with sultry 
sophistication, the dancers have 
meticulous control over their body 
movements and facial expressions. 
So successful is the illusion that 
there really are cats on the stage, it's 
easy to replace the dancers with a 
real cal in one's mind 's eye. 
Everything's there, from the split-
second flick of the head to the rub-
bing against onc another to show 
affection. Designer John Napier is 
the creator behind this eerie effect 
of pan human , part feline creatures. 

Like a sublime species moving 
through the shadows of the night, 
the Iellicle Cats prowl on a stage 
made to look like an abandoned 
alley. The black walls and looming 
moon contribute to the mysterious 
world of the Jelliele Cats. The 
props, three-and-a-half times their 
normal size, give the audience a 
feline view or rusted trash cans, car 
tires and shocs. 

1ellicle Cats, the audience learns, 
are not unlike people. They suffer 
from lingering memories of success 
and happiness that can never be 
dupli cated in their old age. Hence 
the particular poignancy of the song 
"Memories," sung by Natalie Toro 
as Grizabella, the "Glamour Cat." 

The producers want the audience 
on the West Coast to see the perfor-
mance the way it would be seen on 
Broadway, so the costume each cat 
wears is an exact replica of 1M one

Sherlock Facts ' 
• Created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance in 1887. 

• Proof that publishers don't know when they've struck gold, Doyle's creation was turned down 
for being too long for a short story and too short for a novel. After half a year of peddling the 
script he wrote in less than two months. Doyle received an offer from 8 firm specializing in 
'cheap and often sensational literature.' 

• Doyle 's success stemmed from the Holmes short stories published in The Strand Magazine, 
Ironically. Doyle hated being known only as the creator of Sherlock Holmes as he considered 
his other writings to be much more important.

RoIllnc on: Come have a coffee and a cigarette with Lagwagon . The Santa Barbara-based quintet 
brought its sonic attack to SOMA last Tuesday night along with No Use For A Name . 

Jump on the Lagwagon 
On the strength of a "Double Plaidinum" album, band 

rolls into San Diego to conquer SOMA 
By Scott Vac" 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

[t used to be that punk bands 
were fonned by an~ry kids with 
nothing to do and very lillie musi-
cal talent. Those type of bands still 
c)(ist today, but many punk bands 
are abandoning the formula of blis-
tering speed and howling vocals 
and turning to a combination of 
typical hardcore ami smooth pop 
sensibilities, peppered with 
moments of great mu~idanship . 

One such band. S nta Barbara's 
own Lagwagon. ha, been perfe<.:l-
ing this craft since 1'i'l0. One of the 
hardest touring bUIl(h around . 
Ligwagon has com pie-ted two tours 
with NOFX, as well ,IS thw own 
tour~ of Japan, Europe, Austra lia 
and thl! United Statl!~ . 

The hand also appeared on last 
year\ Warpl!d Tour with 
Pennywise. NOFX and Fi~hbone . 

Last Tuesday night , Lagwagon 
brought their perwnul hlend of pop 
and hardcore to SOMA in support 
of their fourth Fat Wreck Chords 
release, Double Plaitlinum. 

Amidsl resounding cheer~, 
Lagwagon took the ~rage wilhout a 
word, and proceeded to deliver a 
lackluster performance. 

Vocalist Joey Cape faccd Ihe 
hack of the stage a large portion of 
Ihe time, and the audience had 10 
endure long lull , between song~, 
during which there was no interac· 
ti on between the hand and the 

crowd. Cape also fail ed to 
announce the names of the songs, 
so those who weren ' t familiar with 
Double Plaidinum had no idea 
what was being played. 

Aftcr about si x songs, the mood 
changed. Lagwagon launched into 
lhe crowd favorite "Violins" with 
renewed vigor and animation. A 
bond was forged bet ween the band 
and Ihe audience, replacing the dis-
tance that previously separated 
them. 

In all , Lagwagon played 18 
songs from their four releases, pri -
marily In blocks according to 
alhum. 

Songs from Lagwagon's second 
alhum, Trashed, elicited the largest 
crowd 1'C,pon~e, and were ~ome of 
the he, t of thl! scI. "Island of Shame" 
featured imprc~,ive guitar work ,et 
to a Ilawle~~ , quick-paced rhYlhm. 

Another highlight of the 
evening occurred when Lagwagon 

,hrought out Chris, lead si nger of 
opening band The Ataris, to sing 
"Whipping Boy." Chri s filled in 
admirahly. running maniaca lly 
around the stage and catapulting 
himself into the audience at the 
song', end. 

Perhap' the brightcst moment of 
the sct came in Ihe form of 
Lagwagon's obligatory cover of 
Van Morri son's "Brown Eyed 
Girl," a cranked-up version of the 
old che,tnut that threw the crowd 
i nlo a frenlY. 

Lagwagon played a number of 
songs from Double Plaidinum , 
including "Making Friends," "One 
Thing To Love" and 
"Unfurnished." 

Despite the band's recovery 
after an abysmal start, it left the 
stage following ilS last song .)Yith-
out a word of thanks or farewell , 
leaving the audience puzzled and 
di sappointed. 

Joining Lagwagon on tour is 
label male No Use For A Name, 
another melodic hardcore band oul 
of Sunnyvale, Calif. The band is 
touring to promote its fifth full-
Icngth rc l ea~c, Makillg Fr;el/ds. 

No Usc For A Name proved to 
be a local favorile . evoking a thun-
derous respon!>e after being 
announced. The band kicked it oIl 
wi th "The Answer b Still No," the 
li rst track on Makin g Frierld.L 

No U,e For A Name roared 
through 16 ~ongs, featuring pitch-
perfect vocal harmonies, slick gui-
tar riffs and a throbbing rhYlhm 
seclion. The hand displayed a large 
amount of energy, and front man 
Tony Sly maintained a great rap-
pon wilh the audience. 

Highlights from Making 
friel/ds induded "Invincible," "On 
The Outside" and the frenetic "A 
Postcard Would Be Nice." No Use 
For A Name also played a variety 
of old favorites, such as "Justifi ed 
Black Eye" and their closing num-
ber, "Feeding The Fire: '
