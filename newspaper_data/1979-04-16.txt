Twice a Week 

Campus Crusaders for Krishna

Clad in pink heet , s<lndals 

and bells, member of the 
Hare Krishna movement have 
been vi iting CSD twice a 
week since the beginning of 
spring quarter to " attract the 
students to ' Go~ conscious-
ness,'" according to Visva 
Mohan Das. 

The Krishnas came to 
ucsb from their Pacific 
Beach center to "influence 
students to wake up to the 
spiritual reality," said Mohan 
Das. 

Mohan Das explained that 
the goal of the Krishna 
movement is to teach another 
nature beyond the "material " 

world. " Thi whole ampu 
deal with material knowl-
dge .. . in their tudies. Th 
tudent · neglect the pir-

itual ," he ommented. 
" True knowledge," Mohan 

Da continued, " is to know 
what is material and what is 
pi ritual and who the 

controlle'r is of both ." He 
believes that .. a harmoniou 
ituation will come about" 

when everyone understands 
this "knowledge." 

Other Krishnas referred all -
que tions to Mohan Das, 
citing his superior knowledge. 

The group has received " no 
major personal complaints " 
while at UCSD. " Some sma ll 
complaints came to the front 

offi e, but we worked them 
out right away," he aid. 

" We ' v e had no bad 
re ponse," remark d fohan 
Sas. " Most of the tudents 
have een us here before. " He 
added that 80 percent of the 
students on campus have 
received Krishna literature. 

Mohan Das believes that 
much can be accomplished for 
the movement if students 
become aware of " Krishna 
consciousness.' , 

"We come to the campus 
twice a week because we 
understand that the student 
population in this country has 
a direct and popular influence 
on the cu lture," he said .

Edelman Appealing His Tenure Denial 
By Katherine Hafner 

Staff Writer 
Assistant Profes or of 

History, Robett Edelman, who 
recently received a negative 
recommendation for tenure 
from hi department, has 
ubmitted a rebuttal to the 

Committee on Acad mi 
P ronnel ( AP) , in the hope 
of overturning the depart-

Profe or Allan Mitchell ,

department, met with a group 
of approximatel y thirt y 
students who were up et at the

on March 1. to discu s 
Edelman' case. 

Mitch II told The Guardian 
that the mo t he could ay at th~

majorit of the 'enior facalt 
memb r vo. d n gativcl , and 
that it wa ' not a unanimous 

Popular Professor's Book Is In Question 
vote. For legal reasons , he aid. 
he could not state specific 
criticisms of Edelman ' work . 

Mitchell believe that there 
hould be a better means for 

having student input into th 
tenure process . It i not

Mitchell , " and on th quality

Opinion 
Letters to the Editor 

The Guardian. Is 
Electioneering 

Editor: 
This letter is written in 

response to the blatant 
electioneering you engaged in 
In your editorial of Wed., April 
11. In that editorial you printed 
allegations that were not 
factual, to put it kindly. 

First, you state that both 
Robert East and Charles A. 
Patterson are psuedonyms for 
my writing. As I stated in an 
earlier letter, the Robert East 
article was indeed written by 
me . Charles A. Patterson, 
however, is not my psuedonym, 
but a collective byline used 
primarily for a regular new 
IndlClMor column (the fictitious 
nature of Patterson can easily 
be ascertained by his picture) . I 
used the byline Robert East for 
two reasons: out of habit (it's 
been 59 long since I've been 
signing anything but letters) 
and out of a desire to avoid 
charges of premature cam-
paigning (by latching onto the 
credibility of the article) . 

The use of the adjectives in 
your editorial aside, the three . 
articles on the AS as well as the 
piece on the Advocate Program 
were all accurate Cactual 
articles. If the subjects oC the 
article disagree with the 
articles they are free to 
respond, and have been invited 
on many occasions to do sO. And 
the major story, on Carlos 
Montalvo and SOAP , was 
identified as a "Report &I 
Commentary, " thus your 
criticism is irrelevant. 

This is not to say that I, or the 

new Indicator collective, am 
totally satisfied with the front 
page of the last nl. Rather, 
many collective members 
object to the preponderance oC 
the stories, and the net front 
page effect. It was not a 
decision based on strategy , but 
on necessity, for reasons I will 
not go into now. 

However, it should be noted 
that I was exonerated, by the 
Elections Committee, of 
violations of the Election 
Codes , based upon a violation 
filed by a member of the 
" Question Authority" slate, the 
committee Cound that the 
articles in question were not 
examples of improper cam-
paign practices . 

And it is indeed curious to 
note the not-50-subtle biases 
contained in your article and 
editorial. An appeal to integrity 
is strange Cor a paper which 
endorsed a friend Cor AS 
President after filling its paper 
with his pearls ' oC wisdom all 
year, and then gave him a job 
as editor a fter he lost. Or for a 
paper which last year endorsed 
a candidate for Commissioner 
oC Communications, a person 
utterly without qualiCicatioJ)s, 
for the stated reason that he 
would leave you completely 
a lone. Or for a paper Which, in 
the s ame issue that you 
chastized me , featured , Cor no 
apparent reas on, rema rks by a 
candida te for Commissioner of 
Communications on page I , 
making him look like a fri end of 
s tudents. Are you objective? 
Wha t is your objective ? 

Jon Bekken 

"Bekken ni Report: 
. Political Shot 

Editor: 
The 6 April issue of The 

GuardIan ran an arrogant 
letter from Jon Bekken. 
Bekken admitted that he had 
written an article entiti.:d, 
" SOAP Comes Clean ", 
featured in the April 3-16 issue 
of the new Indlutor under the 
general heading of Report &I 
Commentary. In this ,arne 
letter, Bekken confirmed that 
he was a candidate Cor office in 
the AS. However, he tells us, 
" Campaigning is not allowed 
until next week." 

This guy must feel that he is 
some fonn of superior being-
able to speak and write with a 
subtlety having subliminal 
meanings beyond the per-
ception of the poor dumb UCSD 
undergrad. 

What does he call that article 
in the new Indicator? Does he 
really believe we all saw that as 
an example of investigative 
reporting? Clearly, the writer 
w;lS taking a political shot at 
thl. cat, Montalvo. Why this 
fellow Montalvo waa a target 
wa. not apparent, The 
connection was not obvious 
when the Dew I .... ell&or article 
fir.t appeared because the 
writer was byllned aa Robert 
East - complete with 
bIographIcal .nap8bot • a nI 
staffer. But, now that we know 

that Robert East is Jon Bekken, 
a candidate for AS olfice, whose 
views oppose those of Carlos 
Montalvo, we can begin to see 
through the smoke. The article 
was a political move - in clear 
violation ofthecampalgn rules. 
The attempt to camouflage the 
political assault on Montalvo 
and disguise it as "Report &I 
Comment~ry ," complete with 
a phony byline, illustrates the 
unprincipled character of both 
the writer of the article and the 
editorial stafC of the new 
indicator. 

The editors of new indicator 
went far beyond the protection 
of a source in the true 
journalistic traditions. Instead, 
the nl fabricated a fictitious 
character to permit him to 
carry out a political action in 
flagrant violation of the tenets 
we, the students of UCSD, have 
set. forth to govern elections . . ' 

The new uidlcHLur ana ttoben. 
East, or Jon Bekken, or 
whatever else he may be 
calling himself this week are 
treating us like mushrooms. 
They are trying to keep us In the 
dark and feed us bullshit! They 
may call It Journalism, but it 
smells like something else. It 
looks as though while trying to 
smear Montalvo, BPkken gave 
us a good look at his own twisted 
psyche. He did us all a favor.

of what could be a measles 
outbrea k," said Donald 
Ramras, M.D., Health Officer 
for San Diego County. 

"We want to nip this in the 
bud through education and 
immunization. We are trying to 
get all schools to check student 
health records to assure that all 
children have been immunized 
since this is what California 

state law speciries." He added, 
" We are also urging the schools 
to notify the parents oC 
unimmunized children in the 
hopes of getting everyone 
vaccinated ... 

High school and college 
students, Ramras indicated, 
are almost 90% immunized. 
However, he pointed out that 
many children immunized 
before 1968 received a 
non protective vaccine. " Such 
people who have not since 
gotten measles and who are not 
pregnant should get them-
selves vaccinated." 

"Measles cycles occur about 
every other year," noted 

Ramras .• 'In the first 13 weeks 
oC 1977, Cor example, 190 cases 
were reported, compared to 
only 22 in 1978 in the same time 
period. We received 62 reports 
in the first 13 weeks of 1979, so 
we are not as high as two years 
ago, but it is still something we 
want to watch carefully." 

Ramras stressed that this is 
" plain old measles" nol 
German measles. " Our biggest 
worry, therefore, is not the 
measles themselves but the 
complications they can lead 
to." He mentioned that five to 
ten percent oC the people who 
catch measles develop middle

them Ive so thinly ," aid 
Bond. " It would be better to 
zero in on a rea onable course 
load." 

An earlier drop dea dline 
could encourage students to be 
more careful in choosing 
classes, according to Bond . 

Other 'ludents , Bond said, 
register for courses with the 
intention of dropping if th y 
cannot earn a high grade in the 
clas . Many of the e tudents 
will regi ter for the cia s at a 
later quarter and have an 
advantage over those who 
"can't aCCord that luxury," he 
commented. 

"They take up the time oC the 
instructors, TAs, graders and 
space," Bond said of such 
students. By reducing the drop 
deadline to the fourth week, 
they would be deterred from 
" fishing around" for classes, 
Bond remarked. 

He said that students would 
still be able to drop a class 
beyond the Courth week if "they 
were really blowing the 
course," a dding that "most 
seriou students would run into 
that maybe once in their 
academic career." 

A Courth week drop deadline 
cou ld also " decou pie" 
aca demic motiv from 
dropping cia s s, Bond said. If 
implemented , ihe deadline 
policy would not require 
instructors to provide tudent 
with an indication oC their

Another "decoupling" factor

Unaffected by- Ruling

The recent United State 

Supreme Court decision that 
the government dpes not have 
the power to give the public free

will not affect Public Acce s

UCSD students take an active 
part in the production of PACE 
programs . Michael Real , 
Assistant Professor in 
Communications and PACE 
coordinator, said the ruling will 
not affect PACE but it will 
affect other public access 
groups. The reason Cor this 
being he added, " The ruling 
applies to only FCC (Federal 
Communications Commission) 
requirements and leaves 
standing local requirements." 

The ruling struck down a set 
oC rules adopted by the F C in 
1976 for ing cable TV to ullow 
the public use of their channels. 
The court ruled that ongress

to take away editorial Creedom 
of cable broa dca tel' s by 
allowing acces to outsiders. 

The cable compunie 
c hallenged that the FCC went 
beyond it authority with its

a ddition. the ruling violated the 
constitutional gua ra ntee of

Nuclear Power: How ~ It Really Works 
By Doul Campion 

Sdenre Editor 
In the midst of all the 

argument over the benefits and 
potential dangers of nuclear 
power generators, the agitated 

nuclear planL is not drawn 
directly from nature, though. 
Instead, water is heated and 
turned to steam, as is done in 
coal-burning electric genera-
tors . The steam spins the

members of both sides often 
assume. perhaps incorrectly, 
that their audience knows and 
understands the mechanism of 
electricity generation using 
nuclear power. That mech-
anism is. in fact, a relatively 
easy one to comprehend. 

The manner in which a 
nuclear power plant generates 
electricity is essentially the 
same as in most other types of 
power plants. As in a hydraulic 
plant where trapped water 
flows down the spillway of a 
dam , a constant current is used 
to spin plant turbines which 
turn the electric generators. 

The current of water in a

turbine a nd then is cooled and 
condenses to water again, 
returning to repeat the cycle. It 
is the mechani m used in 
heating the water th a t 
distingui shes nuclear power 
electric generators from all . 
others. 

Uranium of a tomic weight 
235 (that is. 235 tim s as heavy 
as a hydrogen atom) is able to 
absorb one neutron and thell' 
"split" to form lighter 
elements such as strontium and 
iodine. This nuclear " fission " 
al 0 releases more neutrons 
which can be a bsorbed by 
neighboring atoms of urantum-
235, and a sort of chain reaction

results. In the process of this 
reaction, so much heat is 
released that the fission of one 
ounce ·of uranium -235 is 
equivalent to the burning of 100 
tons of coa I. 

Allowed to proceed in a n 
uncontrolled ma nner. this was 
the mechanism used in the 
explosion of the atomic bomb . 
However, when controlled a in 
a nuclea r power pl ant, the heat 
of the reaction can be captured 
and used to produce th e steam 
needed to spi n the plant 's 
turbines. 

In one form of nuclear power 
pl ant, call ed a pressurized 
water reactor, the water supply 
that i heated directly by th e 
radioactive fuel , a nd thus 
becomes radioactive itself, is 
under ex treme pressure which 
prevents it from boiling even 
though it often reaches a 
temperature of 600 degrees F. 
This super-heated radioactive 
water is pumped in pipes 
through a cha mber adjacent to 
the reaction vessel. It is thc 
heat radiating from the e 
pipes, then, which causes water 
in the second chamber to turn to 
team. So in a pressurized 

water ractor, the stea m used to 
s pin the turbin es is not 
radioactive. 

Water from a third source is 
pumped through another set of 
pipes to cool a nd condense the 
steam to water again after it 
has passed the turbines. 

In a boiling water reactor, the 
water hea ted directly by the 
nuclear reaction is under much 
less pres ure. It i a llowed to 
boil and the radioactive s team

produced is what powers the 
generator turbines . 

In both pressurized a nd 
boiling water reactors , the 
water which comes in direct 
contact with the radioactive 

though , the rods may partially 
melt and fuse together, making 
it impo sible to slide them into 
place. When this is the ca<;e . the 
temperature continues to

fuel rods is compl etely seJf-
contained and isolated from the 
environment. Th e d a nger 
occurs when , as in the ca e of 
the Three Mile Is land plant. the 
pumping system and its backup 
systems do not function . 

When tha t happens, the heat 
built up in the system is not 
"carried of[" by the cooling 
water and the reaction must be 
slowed or stopped. This is done 
by inserti ng neutron-a bsorbing 
rods between the fuel rods , 
denying the uranium-235 the 
neutrons it needs to undergo 
fission . 

If the temperature becomes 
too high before this can be done, 

also due to the buildup of stea m , 
and in order to avoid an 
unco ntroll ed burs t in the 
syste m. some steam must be 
carefully released. At Thre 
Mile I s l<l nd thi r e lease 
consistcd of radioactive tca m. 

l[ so much steam is I'eleased 
that the reactor core dries , a 
system engages which flood 
the core with water to prevent it 
from becoming so hot that it 
melts through its ca ing. 

Through its a bility to prod uce 
tremendous amounts of energy 
from relati vely little fuel. 
nuclea r power ha become a 
popular means of generating 
electricity.

On Friday the 13th 

UCR Spoils .V ... ball Hopes 
By Jon Goetz 

Senior Staff Wrller 
UCR's volleyball team calls 

the day "Good Friday." To 
IUCSD volleyball players it's 
known as "Friday the 13th." 

That day , April 13, was 
unlucky for UCSD because: 
-They lost to Riverside three 
games to two, after beating 
them three to one earlier in the 
season. 
- The loss to last place 

I Riverside dropped the Tritons 
from second to third place in 

I 
the Calirornia Collegiate 
Volleyball Conference. 
- The loss all but ruled out a 
shot at going to the national 
tournament in Indiana for the 
team. 

That day was good for 
Riverside because : 
-They played "way over their 
heads ... about ten limes better 

than they were capable of 
playing," according to losing 
coach Doug Dannevik. 
- They had a Wild, cheering, 
chanting crowd that rooted 
their home team to a .. uper 
high." 

The lead see-sawed through· 
out the match. UCSD jumped . 
ahead with a 15-6 win, but UCR 
retaliated in a 15-7 victory. The 
teams split the next two games, 
sending the match into a fifth 
game. Riverside snapped a 7-7 
tie, and went on to win it 15-11. 

Triton players finished the 
match tired and discouraged 
after losing to the last place in 
their league. Yet the los . 
according to Dannevik, was 
due to an outstanding effort by 
Riverside rather than poor 
UCSD play . • 

" ot one facet of our game 
wa n ' t good," he sai d .

Two UC Riverside shots down the third base line sunk the UCSD 
softball team 3-0 Thursday. Jill Keene picked up the loss for the 
Tritons. Tracy Weisneheimer slugged two hits and stole two 
bases, but coulda't make it across the plate. Several putouts at 
home plate and foiled stolen bases by the UCSD defense pleased

By Wayne Hunt 

Stair Writer 
Triton golfers easily notched 

another lopsided victory in 
disposing o( Pomona Pitzer, 42-
12, at the Redhill Country Club 
in Pomona. 

Tim Sullivan and £irst time 
competitor Scott Tapper red the 
romp with rounds of 80 and 83 . 

"It was an important dual 
match," said Owens. Pomona 
Pitzer, a rivalNAIAdivisionIlI 
opponent, "was certainly not 
that strong." 

Harris Frankel. Jim Miller 
and Dave Wernik, three Triton 
stalwarts, were "golfed out" 
according to Owens. 

"We did not really have our 
strongest team there. We gave 

the other golfers a chance while 
others were taking a break," 
commented Owens. 

There were not any hand outs 
when UCSD went up against 
Grand Canyon College from 
Arizona last Tuesday. . 

Caught two men short. the 
Tritons lacked depth in losing 
31(}-320, in straight stroke play . 
GCC was able to post its Cour 
lowest scores (rom its six 
strongest golfers. 

"It was not a strong 
showing," said Owens. The 
Tritons again failed to break 80. 
Jim Miller carded an 80 for the 
low team score. 

"We will be out for a little 
revenge," warned Owens when

" We want to gel them off

Garfunkel's "Sound of Silence" 
in a mere 50 seconds. The 
Monkee's song "She" has now 
been reproduced at 78rpm. 

then went into the slowest song 
of the set. 

The Dickies, in an offstage 
conversation said they weren't 
into " political shit" nor out to 
make dynamic social state-
ments. (They were drinking 
Coors beer .) They aren't 
disgusted with 'Society or the 
world by any means . Their 
music is pure fun . They say 
what started as ajoke is getting 
to be expensive with recog-
nition. Now they have to buy 
props. 

Besides rehearsing in the 
garage, the boys spend time 
watching movies. T .V., and 

playing electronic games . They 
say they can even get into golf 
'and bowling that way. An 
interest in, science fiction 
became the instigation for their 
album title , the Incredible 
Shrinking Dickies. 

Though much of the Dickies' 
sound is from previously 
recorded artists of punk [ame, 
it remains fresh under their 
control. Their version is with 
the potency that hasn't been 
captured in many of the groups 
oC recent. To see the Dickies is 
best described in their terms, 
" It's for fad, for fun, or 
whatever." 

'was the reply of Sta n 
Lee. member or the Dickies, 
wben I asked bim if he was 
,oilll to plan one before the 
show. He looked out onto the 5 
filled rows at the Roxy with 
doubt on his face to a successful 
show at their San Diego debut. 
He told me earlier the ability to 
play good punk depends o~ the 
audience. "It is their adrenelin 
tbat combines with· the 
perfonners oDltage to create a 
biJb energy show. " But those 5 
rows eaded up producing 10 
much adreneUn, the group had 
to come up with 3 encores to 
please their estatic fans . 

Back in 1977. the Dickies 
started playing punk as a satire 
to the new phase of music. They 
rehearsed three weeks then 
appeared at the Whiskey and 
Masque in L.A. Their cult grew 
exponentially aad they are now 
contracted to A6M records and 
doiq tours in England. 

must be watched to be fully 
appreciated. All ofthem use the 
entire stage for moving , 
(excluding the drummer of 
course). Lead singer, Leonard 
Phillips, bends , twists , and 
jumps to each chord in many of 
the' songs. Appropriate props 
accompanied selected cuts. 
Phillips took a dog mask in 
hand and had it sing " Poodle 
Party ." Mask , snorkel, and 
pulverizing a plastic blow up 
fish went along with "Water-
slide." A white skull cap a nd a 
pair of sunglasses with built-in 
eyes were used for " Menta l 
Ward ." Full visual a ppreci-
a tion was at a climax in the fans 
when Phillips took the head of 
Chuck Wagon , sax a nd

pleasure and began dancing

within the department. 

" There are," said Edelman, 
" methodological , political and 
affirmative action overtones. 
This is not to say that 
personality clash doesn 't have 
a basis in something, which 
might in fact be politics. We 
can't be certain." 

Mitchell claimed that " the 
real issue here is how much 
weight should be given to 
outside letters." He feels it is 
unjustifiedly asserted that no 
one in the department is 
capable of judging a spe-
cializeJi manuscript. 

" Who are you going to 
believe? " said Edelman. 

Center 
Deficit 
(Continued from page 1) 

According to Moser, the 
Ch,lOcellor didn 't raise the fee 
" until two quarters after ... 0 
we lost out." 

Said Moser, " The Chancellor 
told (the board) he would make 
up the loss if we needed it, and 
we did , but he could only afford 
to give us $20,000." 

Carberry said the $20,000 
Crom the Chancellor is to be 
used to extend the patio at 
Building C (presently Future 
Foodsl in the Student Center. 

Due to the loss in fees, the 
Student Center Board was 
forced to revise the 1978-79 
budget recently, said Carberry.

About student participation 
in the judgment of a 
manuscript. Mitchell stated, 
" in order to judge scholarly 
work one must be a scholar. We 
cannot put this into the hands oC 
amateurs without encouraging 
amateurism. " 

[n addition to his rebuttal to 
CAP, Edelman is petitioning 
Cor reconsideration in the Fall 
of 1979, based on a revision oC 
his book ma nuscript and new 
work. 

Edelman's academic file, 
containing articles, letters, 
book reviews , a nd CAPE 
evaluations, goes next to the 
Revelle College Pl'ovoSt and 
Dean of Graduate Students. 

It then goes totheCAP, which 
recommends to Paul Saltman, 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs. members to sit on an 
Ad Hoc Committee. The Ad Hoc 
then makes a recom mendation 
to CAP, which may sustain or 
counterman the department's 
decision . 

Saltman h<ls the final 
juri sdiction . According to 
Saltman, his decision is ba ed 
on "everything that is included 
in the candidates file, Crom the

" In borderl ine s ituations,"

receive app roval from the 
Academic Senate, according to 
Bond, but was instead made by 
the four college provosts . 
Because drop policies a re a 
faculty responsibility , the 
present drop deadline is not 
" legitimate," according to 
Bond. 

However. Bond comm nted 
that if a student's petition was 
turned down after the sixt h 
week of the quarter and he 
c hose to take legal action, "a 
court of law would probably 
rule that the provosts had no 
legal right" to make the policy 
rule. 

Harold Temmer, assistant 
vice chancellor of adminis-
tration, said that " it doesn't 
matter" that the drop policy 
was not made by the CEP, 
although .. from an educational 
point of view , CEP is quite 
i1l"tifiP<i in looking into it ." 

" Anything Lhat' published in 
a cata logue is legally binding," 
Temmer explained. Hecause 
the sixth week drop policy i 
included in the university 's 
catalogue, the deadline can be 
enforced, according to 
Temmer. 

He added that "when 
students read the catalogue, 
it's legally considered a 
contract." If the CEP does not 
take action on the drop policy, 
the sixth week deadline would 
remain enforced, Temmer 
said. Bond said that the CEP first 

found out about the rule's 
history last fall and had 
previously assumed that the 
faculty had approved the drop 
policy . As a result , the 
committee decided to " le-
gitimize" the university's drop 
deadline, he aid,

"Theoretically they should 
not do that ," Bond said of the 
provosts' d ecision, " but it 
doesn't make it illegal."

Krishnas Proselytize 
(Continurd from page I) 

According to Mohan Das , 
member ' of the Krishan 
movement are allowed to 
dress as they please but that 
the " most devoted" of them 
choose to wear the robe . 

"O ur c lothes are our 
uniforms," he said . 
"When you ee a pOliceman, 
you know by the uniform that 
that is where you can go to get 
help Crom the law; if you want 
to know about God, you know 
where to inquire by the 
uniform." 

Mol)an Das said that the 

current women's fashions are 
" not appropriate for those 
who practice (Krishna) COII-
ciou ne s because it puts 
them ... in the frame oC mind 
that 'I am a material body.' " 

Mohan Das stressed that the 
Krishnas are "not soliciting 
on campu - our Iiteratul'e i 
free." 

In addition to their public

efforts, the Pacific Beach
