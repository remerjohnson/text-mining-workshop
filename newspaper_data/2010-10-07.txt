Thousands of students, profes-
sors and parents are mobilizing 
across the nation to rally in today’s 
National Day of Action to Defend 
Public Education — a movement 
initially sparked by last year’s bud-
get cuts, increase in tuition fees and 
layoffs. 

According to the UCSD Coalition 
for Educational Justice, the Day of 
Action is to remind students and 
state legislature that the resistance 
will remain as long as accessibility of 
education remains an issue.

While the original walkout was 

staged at UC campuses on Sept. 24, 
2009, the movement has now spread 
nationwide. 

At least 31 states have called 
for actions to continue the move-
ment to defend public education, 
and continue the movement which 
gained momentum on March 4. 
March 4 was the day of the first rally 
to speak out against budget cuts to 
education.

UCSD Coalition organizer and 
ethnic studies graduate student 
Rashne Limki said that today’s rally 
is to carry forward from where the 
March 4 rally left off in an attempt 
to make education affordable avail-
able again.

The $813 million budget cut 
from the UC system has caused fac-
ulty furloughs, layoffs, fee hikes and 
reduced course offerings. 

The rallies, according to the 
coalition, are a way to bring atten-

tion to these detrimen-
tal effects, though they 
cannot be reversed 
immediately.

“While the ral-
lies are not necessar-
ily where demands get 

met, they are definitely the platform 
to get that to happen — the rallies 
set up visibility to get the powers to 
pay attention,” Limki said.

She said that the movement 

needs support from students, fac-
ulty and professors alike, in order to 
show the administration and state 
legislature that education is a pri-
ority.

The rally at UCSD will begin 
with a walkout at 11:30 a.m. 
Protesters are encouraged to wear 
black to signify a funeral procession 
for accessibility to the UC system. 

At 12 p.m., the gatherers will 
meet at the Silent Tree outside 
Geisel and begin marching.

The rally will continue with 
teach-outs at 12:40 p.m., and an 
open mic event. 

From there, the rally and march 
will move to downtown San Diego 

and meet support from rallies host-
ed at SDSU, other community col-
leges and various K-12 schools.

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue said that dem-
onstrations will attract some of the 
awareness organizers are looking 
for.

“The rallies are definitely a vis-
ible way to draw attention and sup-
port for the pressing issue,” Rue 
said.

Since this is a peaceful dem-
onstration, Rue said the adminis-
tration supports the students’ First 
Amendment rights to occupy the 

CAMPUS PREPARES FOR OCT. 7 RALLY FOR EDUCATION

By Aimly Sirisarnsombat

Three years after the opening of 
Price Center East,  its empty spac-
es are finally occupied by Chase 
Bank, Kaplan Prep Center and The 
Zone, a wellness studio sponsored 
by the UCSD Health and Services 
Department.

Chase Bank, located next to 
Sunshine Market, and Kaplan Test 
Center, located near Library Walk, 
opened at the start of Fall Quarter 
on Sept. 20. The Zone opened on 
Sept. 24. 

The Zone, the third of the new 
spaces, is an extension of the UCSD 
Wellness Cluster. It offers free 
healthy cooking demonstrations, 
yoga classes, fitness workshops and 
other services. The Zone can be 
found next to Jamba Juice in the 
plaza of the Price Center. 

Its daily schedule is based on 
the concept of “snack-sized” pro-
gramming because each program 
typically runs less than an hour. All 
events are drop-in and require no 
contractual agreements. 

Zone programming intern Sarah 
Raifsnider said The Zone is an 
effective way to sample wellness 
resources without having to commit 
to quarter-long recreation classes. 

“For instance, we have two types 
of yoga every week,” Raifsnider 
said. “They’re only a half an hour 
long, so it’s a good way to try 
yoga… without having to commit 
to a quarter long class. [But] if 
you decide you like it, we can pro-
vide you with the resources to get 
into a recreation class [through] 
papers and flyers from the Wellness 
Cluster in our resource center.” 

The integration of these new 
Price Center fixtures is a response 
to the most popular suggestions in

Last week, when nobody was looking, UCSD officials put an end to a three-year free speech saga that spawned 
websites, walkouts and student protests.

On Sept. 30, the administration finally put 
into place the university’s new free speech 
policy, which initially sparked outcry for its 
“draconian” measures when first introduced 
during finals week of Spring 2007. 

Speech policy changes have been met 
with controversy in the past, like in Spring 
2007, when a committee chaired by sports 
facilities manager Don Chadwick was 
released during finals week. 

Students and faculty, feeling that they 
did not have enough time to review and 
comment on the policy, staged a series of 
protests and met with then-Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Joseph Watson to discuss 
their concerns. 

After the American Civil Liberties Union 
wrote an eight-page letter outlining how the 
policy violated the First Amendment, the 

administration created a new free 
speech committee that included 
more students. 

According to Brainerd, the 
most important change is the rule 
allowing for student involvement. 

The policy states that stu-
dents from the A.S. Council and 
Graduate Student Association 
will have an active role when 
reassessing the speech policy, if 
future need arises.

A draft was finalized on Oct. 1, 2009 with 
comments continuing until Dec. 1.

The draft was finalized during May 2010, 
but since it was the end of the quarter, offi-
cials decided to put the policies into effect 
on Monday, Oct. 4.

The new policy stresses that free expres-
sion on campus is allowed on all grounds at 
all times, but the rules for amplified sounds

ProcedureÊAllowsÊSurgeonsÊtoÊAccessÊBrainÊThroughÊEyes
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Jonathan Chan
Staff Writer

UCSD surgeons, in collaboration 
with the University of Washington 
Medical Center, have developed a 
new technique in minimally inva-
sive surgery that consists of sur-
geons inserting probes through tiny 
slits in the patient’s body and com-
pleting the operation in that way.

Head and neck surgeons from 
both university medical centers 
have  spent the past 10 years con-
ducting research and fine-tuning 
the technique, which can now be 
safely used on patients.

The procedure, called TONES 
(transorbital neuroendoscopic sur-
gery), allows surgeons to access the 
brain and skull base through the 
eye socket instead of the traditional 
method of removing the top of the 
skull.

Previously, surgeons also oper-
ated on patients through the nose, 
in between the eyes. But, due to its 
position, going through the nose 

restricts access to parts of the brain 
above and lateral to the eyes.

“Usually for procedures which 
require access to those parts, we 
would cut across the head from ear 
to ear, peel the face down and lift the 
brain,” Assistant Professor of Head 
and Neck Surgery Chris Bergeron 
said. “Using this new technique, we 
can avoid making incisions from 
ear to ear.”

Accessing the brain through the 
eye socket also avoids potentially 
harmful contact with the optic nerves 
(for eyesight), the olfactory nerves 
(for smell), and the carotid and oph-
thalmic arteries, which supply the 
head, neck and eyes with blood. 

In addition, using a TONES pro-
cedure means a less crowded operat-
ing room, as just two surgeons can 
complete it.

The new procedure uses the fun-
damentals of traditional surgery. 
Endoscopes, a long surgical tool 
with a camera on the end, are widely 
used in sinus and brain surgery and 
are also part of the basic equipment 

used in TONES. 
Surgeons use endoscopes to see 

inside the patient via a camera with-
out making wide incisions. 

Bergeron and his colleagues have 
safely performed the procedure on a 
series of 20 patients. 

“The implications of mini-
mally invasive procedures, such as 
TONES, include minimal morbidity 
with as little side effects as possible,” 
Bergeron said. “There is less distur-
bance of the surrounding tissue and 
structure.”

Patients with procedures per-
formed using TONES reported 
fewer post-operative days in the 
hospital, less pain, and minimal or 
non-visible scarring.

Using TONES, cerebral spinal 
fluid leaks and tumors both inside 
and outside of the brain can be 
accessed and treated. 

Surgical procedures on the optic 
nerves can also be performed using 
this technique, as well as fracture 
repairs on the cranial skull base.

“This procedure also holds 

promise for trauma cases,” Bergeron 
noted. “We can attempt to fix a leak 
from the top without a big incision. 
It is also a new way of approaching 
anterior skull base lesions.”

With further research, surgeons 
hope to make TONES applicable 
to tumors in the pituitary gland, 
tumors on the meninge — also 
known as meningiomas — and vas-
cular malformations, or abnormali-
ties of the blood vessels near the 
head.

a survey issued by the Department 
of Student Life five years ago, which 
asked undergraduate students what 
services or vendors they would like 
to see installed on campus. 

“[Because] it takes a lot of 
time and money to put on a sur-
vey, we usually use past surveys,” 
University Centers Advisory Board 
Chair Nicole Metildi said. “We also 
have six college representatives, so 
they’re supposed to go to their con-
stituencies to ask what the general 
feeling is about it.”

Once this information was col-
lected, University Centers Advisory 
Board, — which University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino called a 
“sounding board” for student opin-
ion — investigated the proposals in 
greater detail to choose and approve 
vendors that would fit into Price 
Center’s vacant lots.

When UCAB approves a con-
cept, University Centers issues a 
Request for Proposal out to the 
public, at which point interested 
vendors who offer the service in 
question can reply to be considered 
by UCAB to fill in a vacant space.

A hair salon, which was includ-
ed in University Center officials’ 
plans for Price Center East follow-
ing its May 2008 grand opening, 
is currently in the process of being 
approved for an RFP.

“The hair salon was already 
approved by a committee of the 

UCAB,” Terzino said. “We’ll prob-
ably issue the RFP for the hair salon 
this quarter, hopefully sometime in 
November or within the next two 
months. We hope to have it open by 
the beginning of Fall Quarter 2011.”

Additionally, whereas The Zone 
approached UCAB 12 months ago, 
the process towards constructing 
and opening new businesses not 
associated with the campus can take 
between 18 to 24 months. 

Terzino said the choice to place a 
test center on campus was made by 
UCAB about 18 months ago, based 
on survey results and the observa-
tion that many undergraduates seek 
test preparation services to gain a 
competitive edge on exams like the 
LSAT or the MCAT. 

As far back as 2006, it was decid-
ed that a bank would fill one of the 
spaces. 

Terzino said choosing the par-
ticular banking corporation and 
testing center was a decision made 
by a committee of UCAB, who 
voted for Chase and Kaplan over 
other similar vendors willing to 
accept the vacant lots. 

In addition to changes in Price 
Center, Shogun, the Japanese res-
taurant located on the second floor, 
will be expanding by renovating a 
portion of its location into “Noodle 
Café,” an extension UCAB offices 
hope will be open to the public in 
late October.

Terzino also said University 

Centers considered replacing one 
of the vacant lots with a new cof-
fee shop in Price Center East. 
However, they decided to renovate 
Espresso Roma because there are 
already many coffee vendors on 
campus. 

A store called “Triton Outfitters,” 
where students can find apparel 
branded by students on campus, is 
set to claim the space next to Sun 
God Lounge on the second level of 
Price Center.

Vendors gain revenue from the 
UCSD student body. This revenue 
pays their rent for the tenant spaces, 
and these bills contribute to the 
University Centers’ operation and 
maintenance costs, which are fund-
ed by the University Center fees all 
students pay. 

Less vendors equate to less rent 
collected from vendors, a situation 
that would force University Centers 
to raise student fees. 

“All students pay University 
Center fees, which help with the 
maintenance of University Center 
buildings,” Metildi said. “That’s 
why it’s good for PC to have ven-
dors. Not only do vendors make 
[Price Center] a good place to visit, 
the rent they pay helps University 
Centers not have to raise University 
Center fees.”

— such as speakers or bullhorns — 
have been clarified.

Students can use amplified sound 
without prior reservation 
from the school in select 
places, including Student 
Center Plaza, Revelle’s 
Grassy Knoll and the 
Muir College Quad. 
The times available are 
typically 11:30 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Monday through 
Friday, and from 4 p.m. 
to 10 p.m. Saturday and 
Sunday.

“The previous policy 
had not been revised 
for nearly 20 years and 
gave the impression 
[that] speech activity 
was restricted to certain 
‘zones’ on campus,” PPM 
510 Committee Chair Sally Brainerd 
said. “This policy clarifies that, in 
general, all UC San Diego grounds 
are available for expressive activi-
ties.”

Brainerd said the policy changes 
were already decided before last 
year and thus have nothing to do 
with the racial incidents and fund-
ing freezes that occurred last Spring 
Quarter

One new rule also notifies peo-
ple who are exercising free speech 
rights, but who may be on the edge 

of violating city or state ordinanc-
es, instead of the previous system 
where such a warning system did 
not exist. 

The police will 
advise students who 
are close to violating 
local and state laws, at 
which point they will 
be responsible for their 
legal actions.

Chalking is now per-
mitted only on grounds 
exposed to the weather 
and not in sheltered 
areas protected by roofs, 
overhangs and under-
passes.

These changes clari-
fy rules as well as elimi-
nate the misconception 
of free speech zones on 
campus, according to 

Brainerd. 
The new rules will have no effect 

on non-affiliates who will still be 
governed through the UC speech 
policy, which states that all speech 
by non-affiliates must be approved 
by the administration.   

According to UC policy, affiliates 
include students, employees, volun-
teers, officers, Regents and emeritus 
of the university.

READ UCSDHoping for a repeat of last week’s record 42-minute meeting, I took my seat 
amongst the crowd sitting in on this 
A.S. Council’s meeting. Do wishes real-
ly come true? Tonight, I would find out.

Public input was dominated by a 
speech from Vice Chancellor Penny 
Rue, who thanked council for its work 
on campus.   She urged members to 
visit the Campus Climate website to 
stay informed on 
topics regard-
ing the effort to 
improve campus 
climate, and called 
for the council to 
become involved 
in the 50th anni-
versary events.  

Rue also called attention to an ini-
tiative coming to campus called the 
Global Clinton Initiative.  She empha-
sized how UCSD was chosen out of 
three other elite California universities 
to host this initiative, which will invite 
1,000 college students from over 80 
countries. 

A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
took a part in public input by introduc-
ing her staff, which included Michael 
Bowlus as her External Press Secretary 
and Elizabeth Garcia as her Chief of 
Staff.

During a special presentation, 
Triton Television made a lengthy pre-
sentation. To begin the talk, which 
ultimately ended in a request for more 
funds, TTV showed highlights of the 
water polo game last week. 

Their two big purchases — equip-
ment and a server to store their pro-
duction material — would amount to 
almost $60,000, from andate Reserves. 
TTV also presented three advisers who 
they would like to bring on as faculty 
advisor, business manager and market-
ing consultant.     One of the ultimate 
goals of TTV is to become a revenue-

making A.S. enterprise rather than an 
A.S. organization, according to station 
manager Tom Dadourian.

VP Finance and Resources Andrew 
Ang made the daunting announce-
ment that next week will be the unveil-
ing of the executive budget. He sug-
gested bringing snacks and a way to 
stay hydrated (an ominous warning 
indeed).  

AVP Athletic Relations Pauline 
Nuth announced 
that there will be 
a homecoming 
dance at RIMAC 
Arena, which will 
take place on Oct. 
23.   One more 
way to show our 

school spirit — we’re almost there, 
UCSD. 

AVP Local Affairs Matthew Vu 
reminded council that Oct. 7 is the 
nationwide Day of Action.  There is a 
walkout planned for 11:30 a.m., lead-
ing to a meeting at the Silent Tree.  

AVP Concerts and Events Brian 
Wong announced the 2011 Sun God 
Festival date will be held May 13, the 
Friday during Week Seven of Spring 
Quarter. Let the excitement and 
rumors of potential headliners begin!

Council voted on the proposal 
that Warren College Senator Maclen 
Zilber and Transfer Senator Adam 
Powers brought to council last week 
regarding amending the constitu-
tion to include two transfer sena-
tors rather than one. After a sur-
prisingly calm debate regarding the 
consequences, the amendment was 
approved. Pending approval by four 
of the six college councils, two trans-
fer senators will be added to the 
council roster.

So, I believe my wish did come true. 
We were out before 9 p.m. However, 
nothing is free in this world. Budget 
week, here I come.

campus for the rally
“I support people to exercise the right to 

free expression,” Rue said.
According to organizer and Marshall 

College sophomore Huma Waseem, the rally is 
also a way to bring light to students’ perssonal 
stories. For her, the enrollment in a four-year 
university was harder than expected.

“I’m an immigrant, and my expectation 
about [education in the U.S.] was not met,” 
Waseem said. “[The rally] is a way to get the 
word out, and hopefully change things.”

In order to initiate change, Limki stat-
ed that massive support from the public is 
needed. 

“The movement is largely volunteer-
based; and there is no centralized planning 
organization,” Limki said. “It requires a com-
munity effort.”

The next major statewide conference 
to continue the movement will take place 
on Oct. 30 and 31 at San Francisco State 
University. There, the coalition will vote on 
how to move forward the movement. 

The conference is open to anyone who 
wishes to volunteer and take a larger active 
role in future demonstrations like March 4 
and Oct. 7.

I’m hungry. It’s 6 a.m. and I would trade my left hand for some pollo asado fries.  

Last week I read that Bill Clinton 
— the notoriously cheeseburger-loving 
head of state — decided to cut all 
meat, dairy, processed sugars and pre-
servatives from his diet. This from the 
man who ordered a double hamburg-
er, an order of fries and onion rings, 
and an apple-pie flavored milkshake 
in between speeches at the Center for 
Disease Control’s 2009 Conference on 
Obesity Prevention and Control. 

Only five years after his quadruple 
heart bypass, Clinton’s eating habits 
had again clogged his veins. Four 
months into his new diet, he lost 24 
pounds and is healthier than ever. 

I’ll admit it, my college diet of 
“whatever is easiest and closest to 
me” probably isn’t the healthiest. But 
if someone who was considered a 
regular at his local Micky D’s could go 
vegan, how hard could it be? 

I figured I’d go big or go home: I 
chose to join the ranks of B. Clinton 
and go vegan: essentially the badass 
version of being a vegetarian. My 
future held no meat, no dairy, no any-
thing from animals. 

I hopped online beforehand to 
see if there’d be any negative side 
effects. Most vegans don’t get enough 
B12, vitamin D, calcium, iodine and 
omega-3 fatty acids, and after an 
expensive trip to CVS I had picked up 
the supplements in pill form. Yum. 

And so it began.
I love fruits and (most) veggies. 

Apples and orange juice for break-
fast? No problem. A Greek salad — 
hold the feta — for lunch? A cinch. 
Chipotle salad bowl with grilled veg-
gies for dinner? Awesome. 

But let’s be honest: There are 
only so many days you can walk into 
Chipotle and order the slightly soggy 
veggies while the grilled chicken stares 
up at you. And there are only so many 
times you can open your fridge and 
ignore the pepper jack, begging to 
become sourdough grilled cheese.

It didn’t help that the weather was 
acting like a poorly designed roller-
coaster. Blistering hot on Wednesday. 
Ice cream, anyone? Freezing rain on 
Thursday. Doesn’t pho sound good? 
Clear skies Friday meant I could 
resume checking the “Nutritional 
Facts” for anything animal. 

A week into it, I had lost five 
pounds, but I also couldn’t do much 
aside from thinking about food. 
Simple things like bread was off the 
menu. Even my bird could eat bread. 

My goal was to be healthier, but 
jumping onto the vegan train cold 
turkey — pun intended — was too 
intense. Whoever said “moderation 
is key” was onto something. If you’re 
animal friendly, or just want to try to 
something new, start slow, and con-
sult a doctor before doing anything 
drastic. Jumping into a strict “fruits 
and veggies” diet might have worked 
for Bill — but then again, this was the 
man who got Israel and Palestine to 
sign the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration 
of Principles peace treaty. So why 
shouldn’t he be able to tackle the hard-
est diet known to mankind? Good for 
you Mr. President, you’ve once again 
proved that you’re cooler than me.

It’s taken $2,500, national scrutiny and 
a little outside help, but with today’s Day 
of Action, it looks like UCSD has finally 
found a cause it’s ready to plant its flag on. 
Oct. 7 is the hopeful sequel to last spring’s 
March 4 Day of Action, which made head-
lines as a national event to defend educa-
tion and mobilized 1,000 UCSD students.

Event organizers are determined that 
newcomers will not forget the need to 
make higher education affordable. That’s 
the good news. Now, if only those fired up 
about the zeros at the end of our tuition 
bills could figure out what we’re actually 
supposed to do to help. The Facebook 
event page – the only publicized indica-
tion that this demonstration is even taking 
place – is regrettably quiet on the matter.

Of course, the student leaders that 
put together the Oct. 7 Day of Action 
deserve mad props for finding the time 
to organize in the middle of Week One 
madness. Pulling students away from 
recruitment and free Korean barbeque to 
make sure that this issue doesn’t fade into 
the background (cancer cluster, anyone?) 
is no easy task. And while we have yet to 
see results from Sacramento, these Days 
of Action provide opportunity to yell our-
selves hoarse and show some outrage over 
the now-infamous 32-percent fee increase 
enacted last November. 

That’s not including the chance to do 
some yelling in cyberspace. This year’s 
student-led virtual sit-in — where students 
logged into a program that accessed the 
UC Office of the President website until 
the server overloaded — is a worthy hom-
age to the sit-in’s creator, visual arts profes-
sor Ricardo Dominguez. Dominguez, now 

facing internal inquiries after orchestrat-
ing the act of electronic disobedience last 
year, will have to sit this one out until 
the administrative dust settles. Carrying 
it out anyway is still a fitting tribute to a 
professor who is currently wrapped up in 
the irony of being penalized for doing the 
work he was hired to do.  

So, congratulations on keeping the 
digitized dream alive, but virtual protest or 
not — everything leading up to this event 
promises a smaller turnout than last year, 
from the last-minute advertising to the 
mellowed-out student body.

Last spring, March 4 was perfectly 
timed. It was the culmination of weeks 
of moral outrage and unrest that began 
with one racially themed party. After three 
protests that put the campus in a “state of 
emergency” and attracted national atten-
tion, those 12 hours of rallies and speeches 
were the cathartic end of the most explo-
sive two weeks UCSD has had for years. 

The response was inspiring; students 
and teachers alike took over the school. 
They made fiery speeches at Price Center. 
They congregated at Balboa Park. All over 
the campus and then — as the demonstra-
tion left UCSD — all over San Diego, they 
declared the unfairness of budget cuts and 
fee increases. 

One spring break later, it seemed 
like all was forgotten; the big question 
on everybody’s mind wasn’t whether 
Sacramento would hear our plea, it was 
whether we’d be able to cinch Ludacris for 
Sun God (if only, Drake. If only). While 
the cost of education is still a headline 
issue, without a major catalyst, it looks 
like this time around, few students will 

When a Day of Action gets buried 
under bad timing — and bad 
advertising — it’s hard to hold out 
hope for a new round of crusaders.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre

Dear Editor,
I must bring to attention the 

topic of rain couture. This past 
Monday it rained. I would assume 
the individuals who attend UCSD 
would at least look outside their 
windows before they left for class, 
yet I stand corrected. 

I was amazed to see girls in high 
heels strutting on the wet payment 
in the rain as if it were a catwalk. 
I will not even mention the other 
garments people wore that do not 
suffice for rain like weather. What 
are girls thinking?! It is honestly 
ridiculous that there is some type of 
female population on campus that 
feels the need to wear high heels in 
the rain! 

School is for learning; it is not 
a fashion show. I understand want-
ing to look good at school. UCSD 
is a social place and no matter what 
people say, you are judged by your 
looks. I do understand this too. My 
freshman year I was on an athletic 
team here at UCSD. My clothing 
consisted of sweats, Underarmour, 
workout clothes, spandex, sneak-
ers, etc. I did not wear makeup and 
almost always had my hair up. I did 
not care about how I looked, I cared 
about my sport. 

The following year I did not 
participate in athletics at UCSD 
and found myself confused about 
what to wear exactly. I backtracked 
a little and wore some things from 
high school: the typical jeans and a 
UCSD pullover. 

My third year I evolved some-

what and found myself buying better 
clothes. 

I started to transform the way my 
body looked and started the daily 
routine of makeup in the morning 
before school. I started to like buy-
ing clothes again because it made 
me feel good about myself. I knew 
my confidence was growing and that 
as long as I felt good, that was all 
that mattered.

 And now I find myself as a 
fourth year. I have come a long way 
from those days of sweats. I actually 
don’t even think I own a pair as of 
now. 

My closet is full of items that I 
love, and I would not have it any 
other way. 

If you are one of my friends, you 
know about the shoe collection.

 I have finally grown up and 
accepted that I am a woman and 
that I need to dress like one. So, 
when I see girls in high heels in the 
rain, I understand where they are 
coming from, even if it is a little bit 
extreme in my book. 

I figure, as long as you are happy 
and feel good, then fine, wear heels 
in the rain. I just hope it is for you.

have much to say. 
Oct. 7 has the same noble cause, 

but last year’s demonstrations snow-
balled off the momentum of the pro-
tests and the excitement of admin-
istrators finally bowing to student 
demands. Now, a group of student 
leaders has graduated, replaced by 
freshmen who can’t tell “Real Pain” 
from a stubbed toe. 

Mobilizing early in the year is 
important to keeping the issue in 
everyone’s minds, but having this 
event two weeks into the school year 
doesn’t give the apathetic much rea-
son to turn out. Instead, the stress of 
getting off the MATH 10A waitlist 
or working out the kinks in that 
roommate situation take precedence 
over fighting for affordability. Three 
lectures into the year, the average 
student won’t suffer an absence to 
rally when there’s seemingly nothing 
wrong. 

Then there’re the people who 
don’t even know this is happening 
— and, by the looks of the public-

ity campaign, that includes most of 
the student body. The sole Facebook 
group announcing the event (with 
537 currently confirmed) is a far 
cry from the fliers that papered the 
school, the graffiti that adorned stop 
signs and the chalk that had students 
literally walking on the message to 
speak out.

Last year, there were teach-
ins explaining the purpose of the 
March 4 Day of Action. Fliers 
spelled out the need for a nation-
wide protest, highlighting the 
unprecedented prices of higher 
education. Teachers took time out 
of their day to mention the event 
and offer open discussion. Even if 
you didn’t know what the stink was 
about, if you so much as set foot on 
campus in the weeks leading up to 
the rally, you knew something was 
going down. 

Now, instead of massive and 
widespread outreach, a message 
went out asking people to help flier 
at 6 p.m. the night before the event. 
Instead of blogs, announcements 

during class and TAs speaking 
out, there will be fliering at a time 
when the school shuts down, the 
off-campus kids head home and 
everyone who managed to avoid the 
dreaded 6-9 p.m. classes has better 
places to be.

The Facebook group itself isn’t 
much help. There’s a snazzy poster 
and an event description with a 
long-winded speech about the state 
of education today, invoking exam-
ples from Arizona to New York City.  

But it’s missing some key compo-
nents: an agenda, a schedule, poster 
suggestions, a meeting place, even a 
“How-To” of defending education. 
Various Internet resources claim that 
there’s supposed to be a walkout, 
downtown rally and march, but the 
group includes nary a word about 
times, transportation, or meeting 
spots. For an event where every par-
ticipant is crucial, people can’t speak 
out when they don’t know how to 
find the megaphones.

Some say Fox is where television shows go to die (or die and be resurrected, if youre Family Guy). Its easy to jump 
on this bandwagon  especially if you are 
a fan of such fallen favorites as Arrested 

Development and Firefly. But not all Fox 
shows meet an unfortunately early end. 
Remember those two agents that spent 
nine seasons dealing with strange and 
inexplicable events or the troubled teens 
whose lives in Orange County had audi-
ences mesmerized for four wildly popular 
seasons? These are only two of Foxs many 
successful shows, but because of a few can-
celled programs that developed cult fol-
lowings, people think the terms Fox and 
early grave are synonymous. In fact, the 
fall lineup demonstrates that Fox has kept 
some shows running well past any reason-
able end point, just like any other network.

To see the channels current array 
of living hits and misses, one must look 
to Thursday night primetime. This slot 
usually houses the crown jewels of cable 
television (yes, Thursdays are why they 
invented TiVo), and Fox is no exception 
with Bones clocking in at 8 p.m. and 
Fringe right after 9. 

With Bones in its sixth season, the 
shows initial intrigue is beginning to 
dwindle. When the show first premiered, 
viewers were entranced by the shows 
quirky non-couple  detective Seeley 
Booth and forensic anthropologist Dr. 
Temperance Bones Brennan  and the 
potential for a romance developed over 
bloodstained corpses. By season two, the 
foundation of friendship was solidly in 
place, and we were all itching for them to 
go on a date, make out, something.

The couple finally shared their first 
(albeit forced) kiss in season three, but the 
lip lock seemed awkward. In season four, 
one started to wonder what Wendall the 
Intern looked like shirtless. And by season 
five, my thoughts during the show were 
punctuated grocery store lists or what 
I might have for tomorrows breakfast. 
Bones started out strong with its likeable 
cast, but five seasons of unresolved sexual

Not a Funny Story
Hangover Star Is the Only Spark in Laughless 

Indie Comedy. By Leila Haghighat

FILMREVIEW&INTERVIEW

Its Kind of a Funny Story has a problem-atic title. Between the 
watercolor cityscapes that 
ornament the trailer and the films cast of 
teenage misfits, Funny Story promises 
the snark and irony of Juno, but strays  
despite well-meaning attempts, its not very 
funny at all. 

Written and directed by the Half 
Nelson duo of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, 
the film profiles a suicidal teenager named 
Craig (Keir Gilchrist) and the oddballs he 

meets at a psychi-
atric hospital. Once 
behind the hospitals 
promising doors, 

however, the shallowness of its characters 
and the predictable plot leaves us reach-
ing for a capsule of Zoloft faster than its 
depressed protagonist.

Funny Story chronicles Craigs mental 
collapse when the pressure at his elite high

INTERVIEW

D irector Davis Guggenheim is exhausted. After long hours on the road, the education crusader is ready for the trip home and an opportunity to spend time with his children, who just saw their fathers [most recent film] Waiting For 
Superman, in theaters a few weeks ago.  

My kids are lucky, they won the lottery, Guggenheim said. I 
want every kid to win the lottery. My children are asking about the 
other kids, they want them to be okay. Before they saw the movie, 
they took what they had for granted  what every kid takes for 
granted.

If anyone was going to convince the world that learning is hip, 
Guggenheim may be the man to do it. Hes spent time with U2 and 
has an Oscar resting on his mantle-piece. He is the poster boy for 
unpracticed cool  he breathes it. 

This one was particularly hard, he admits. We filmed in 
Harlem, Washington, East L.A. We also filmed in New Orleans  a 
bunch of other places. The lotteries [to get into charter schools] 
were all happening the same week. We couldnt go to all of them  I 
couldnt go to all of them.

He explains that his colleagues had a wall with every scene in the

tension is enough. By the time season 
six rolled around, any lingering hope for 
Booth and Brennan to be a couple was 
destroyed by my now firmly cemented 
idea of them as friends. By dragging out a 
two-season romance for six years, Bones 
squandered the spark that made it popu-
lar in the first place. Couldnt they have 
just gotten together at the end of season 
three, solved a few crimes and ended the 
series with an adorable baby giggling at his 
moms dancing phalanges? 

On the other end of Foxs spectrum is 
Fringe, a sci-fi drama straight from the 
unfathomable depths of J.J. Abrams mind. 
With Fringes followers there are gener-
ally two groups. First, the fans who have 
improved their level of brain function-
ing simply by trying to wrap their heads 
around the abstract plot twists of each epi-
sode. Then, there are the skeptics  those 
who have seen clips, and cannot under-
stand why anyone would invest an hour a 
week in a show where one of the charac-
ters is a guy who looks like he should be 
playing bingo with Great-Aunt Ethel.

Despite these factions, most would 
agree Fringe requires serious dedication. 
However, the mysteriously intertwined 
nature of the main characters pasts and 
their relationships make it an overall 
rewarding experience. Feelings develop 
between Peter and ice queen Olivia 
(Booth, Bones, feel free to take the hint), 
and the father-son relationship between 
Peter and Walter takes on a new dimen-
sion (literally) in the second season. So, if 
you think you can handle all that Fringe 
has to offer, pop a couple Advil and get 
comfy on the couch, because its going to 
be one hell of a Thursday night. 

If anyone tries to tell you Fox is the 
worst network because it cancelled her 
favorite show, tell them about its Thursday 
lineup, where they arent afraid to let one 
show drag on past its prime and where 
mind-bending stories unravel; that is, 
unless your opponents favorite show is 
Firefly, in which case you should drop 
the issue immediately, as hardcore Firefly 
fans are likely to go River Tam on your ass if 
you insult their favorite space cowboys.

Easy Come Easy GoOscar Winner Exposes the Flaws In American Education System 
film taped to it, connecting them. Very John 
Nash of him.

“Except no genius involved,” he laughs.
Critics seem to disagree. “‘Superman,’” 

which opens this Friday, follows the story of 
five children and their families as they battle 
through public school bureaucracy in hopes 
of securing a spot at a coveted charter school. 
No child depicted is the same, except for the 
enthusiasm about having a richer, more ful-
filling education. Some are wealthy, others are 
poor — all go to terrible schools. 

As the film progresses, the children’s 
stories intertwine with the adults that 
Guggenheim introduces as the children’s 
champions, the ones attempting to incite 
change in the American school system. The 
struggle is futile, tragically so, and though 
Guggenheim dices in animation in an attempt 
to make the film more “fun” and less of an 
informational burden, the effect the children 
imparts on the audience is never diminished. 

As a director, Guggenheim has parted 
ways with his rebellious youth (he was fired 
from his first project). Now, he’s polished. It’s 
odd to describe a man who’s nearing mid-life 
with an Academy Award under his belt as 
“growing,” but the “Inconvenient Truth” direc-
tor has fully embraced it. He’s coming into his 
own, he explains, after a long time. 

“I don’t feel more confident, but I feel like 
I have more tools,” Guggenheim said. “There’s 
a feeling you get when you start a movie, like 
a pit in your stomach. You know when they 
work, when they don’t. Every time it’s like, 
‘God, how am I going to pull this off again?’”

Out of the four documentaries he’s 
made thus far, Guggenheim admits that 
“‘Superman’” is his favorite. For one, 
“‘Superman”’ has demanded much more of 
him — both as a director and as a parent — 
than any other past project. The process was 
frequently exhaustive, involving collecting 
data, names and interviewing a number of 
sources.  Though Guggenheim had originally 
met with 20 families before cutting it down 
to the handful featured in the film — he said 
that choosing which families to feature was 
surprisingly unchallenging. 

“You start with 20, knowing you’re going 
to end up with around five,” he explains. “[It 
wasn’t really hard] because 20 became seven 
really quickly.”

For Guggenheim, the deciding factor was 
how well families could captivate his — and 
the audience’s — attention. 

“All the kids I met really cared,” he said, 
“But, you know, [when] you’re a journalist, 
sometimes you interview people and they’re 
boring or they’re not articulate.” 

He pauses.  
“Boring is too strong of a word. Don’t use 

boring. But when you make a movie, you 
want people to be able to express themselves.” 

Though severing those ties was easy, 
Guggenheim has made it clear that he intends 
to follow the progression of each of the chil-
dren who made it into the film, to help them 
achieve their dreams and assist them in any 
way possible. 

For the youth of America whose hands he 
can’t hold through the uncertainty, he hopes 
his film can do what he can’t by forcing adults 
to act.

“You have to be able to ask tough ques-
tions, especially as a documentary,” he said. 
“There is a revolution happening. I’m more 
hopeful now. We have the ingredients for suc-
cess.” 

We can only hope. But for now, superman 
is going on holiday.

 “I’m going to take a break and be a dad.”

“ZACH GALIFIANAKIS
IS A REVELATION!”

– SCOTT MANTZ

T he concept of being buried alive is unpleas-
ant for most folks, 
and though being 
accompanied by the 
ever-charming Ryan 
Reynolds may sweeten the 
trauma, claustrophobic film-
goers may want to give this 
flick a pass. 

If you can’t decide 
whether “Buried” is the film 
for you, ask yourself (except 
you, Scarlett Johansson. We 
already know how you feel 
on the matter): Does being 
trapped in a cramped space 
in the dark for over an hour 
with Reynolds seem like a 
blast? 

There isn’t much else 
to the film — what you 
see is what you get. Here’s 
the rundown: Paul Conroy 
(Ryan Reynolds) has been 
buried alive and only has at 
his disposal a lighter, a cell 
phone and a quickly dimin-
ishing amount of air. With 
these few items, you expect 
the rest of the film’s plot to 
unravel predictably. Paul 
screams for help as hordes 
of special teams units panic 
and his wife and young son 
dissolve into tears when 
they hear his voice over the 

phone. But refreshingly — 
delightfully, even — those 
assumptions are wrong. 

Spanish director Rodrigo 
Cortés didn’t concern him-
self at all with the standard 
thriller formula in the mak-
ing of “Buried.” He deter-
mined that the only way to 
put us into Paul’s mindset 
as he struggles for life in his 
wooden box was, essentially, 
to put us in the box — for 
the entire 95 minutes of 
the film. When Paul is in 
the dark, the audience is, 
quite literally, in the dark 
with him. There is no night 
vision camera to show us 
what he is doing, and some-
times the darkness lasts for 
unprecedented lengths of 
time. The audience’s dis-
comfort is palpable.

But perhaps this is a 
good thing. Paul Conroy 
certainly isn’t comfortable. 
He is sweating and breath-
less and bleeding — and we 
can see it all at an unnerv-
ingly close distance. The 
camera, also confined to 

the coffin, is hell-bent on 
examining every inch of the 
terror and pain shooting 
through his body. 

For the film’s only actor, 
the pressure is on. Ryan 
Reynolds, of washboard 
abs and pearly whites fame, 
dives into the restricted role 
surprisingly well — a real 
shocker considering he is 
best known for comedies 
such as “Van Wilder” and 
“The Proposal.” However, in 
“Buried,” Reynolds is out to 
prove that he isn’t just the 
funny man with a hot body. 
Fortunately, Reynolds sweats 
and curses with the best of 
them and carries the film’s 
colossal weight on his own. 
True, voices can be heard on 
the phone, but for all intents 
and purposes, this is a one-
man movie.

Some people will 
be unhappy about this. 
Watching one man cope 
with the possibility of his 
own death so realistically 
is not your typical nachos-
and-Icee fare. At no point 
is the film enjoyable to look 
at, but with suspense that 
sticks with you long after 
the lights have come back 
up, that doesn’t mean it isn’t 
worth watching. 

Stuck 
With Him.

ELEKTRA

Hawaiian Crooner Journeys From Elvis Jig To Soulful Pop-Soul

F or the few who have seen 1992’s “Honeymoon in Vegas” — a daft roman-tic comedy starring third-rate Coppola 
Nicolas Cage and pre-“Sex” Sarah Jessica 
Parker — a certain croon may strike a chord 
in your well-trained ears. Amidst the legions 
of Elvis impersonators that breeze through 
the mostly forgettable movie, there is a sneak 
peek of six-year-old Bruno Mars — the man 
behind the hooks of this summer’s “Nothin’ 
On You” and “Billionaire,” as well as his own 
monster hit “Just the Way You Are.”  

Get on YouTube and witness the phe-
nomenon: Dressed like the King in a blue 
jumpsuit, baby-Mars sings “I Can’t Help 
Falling In Love With You,” all while flaunting 
Elvis’ signature hip-shake and snarl. Given 
this get-up, it’s hard to believe this kid would 
grow up to coin 2010’s biggest earworms (Or 
get arrested for cocaine possession in Las 
Vegas, of all places), but man… rocking a 
pompadour before he hit double digits, he’s 
already a freakin’ star.

If his terrifying childhood stage presence 
isn’t any indication, the Hawaiian native 
(with his production team the Smeezingtons) 
has been responsible for gems like Cee Lo 
Green’s Internet hit “Fuck You” and last 
year’s infectious “Right Round” by Flo Rida. 
On top of that, on his debut album Doo-
Wops & Hooligans, Mars tries on every genre 
for size, proving he’s got the chops to be a 

versatile singer and songwriter.
Looking at Mars’ resumé, you’d expect 

a certain kind of album: hip-hop beats, 
smooth vocals, lots of soul. Those elements 
are certainly all there, but Mars goes big on 
his debut, giving every kind of sound at least 
a small share of the spotlight. There’s reggae 
in the Damian Marley collaboration “Liquor 
Store Blues,” Sade-like sex in the unsubtly 
titled “Our First Time” and Jason Mraz 
pluckiness in “The Lazy Song” — a track 
that dares to rhyme “snuggie” and “dougie,” a 
lyrical morsel that could be totally awesome, 
or as it turns out, awesomely bad.  

As expected, some experiments work bet-
ter than others. Mars’ forays into melodically 
sweet ballads are excruciating and melodra-
matic (namely “Talking to the Moon” and 
the droning first single “Just the Way You 
Are”). Yet when he stops raving about how 
wonderful his girlfriend is and mans up a 
bit, his smooth voice goes down a lot more 
easily. 

So while the album is a bit hit-or-miss, 
by offering at least a little something for 
everyone, Doo-Wops & Hooligans makes for 
a perfect pop debut with plenty of room for 
development. 

Check out Bruno Mars when he performs  
at Price Center on Nov. 19.

school proves too much. Craig’s commitment to 
his family — composed of a workaholic father, 
“fragile” mother and bespectacled “child genius” 
sister — later foils his attempt at suicide and 
prompts him to check into Argenon Hospital 
instead.  

There, amongst the psychiatric ward’s array 
of crackpots, Craig finds the answer to all his 
adolescent woes. He falls in love with chronic 
cutter Noelle (Emma Roberts) and befriends 
cleft-lipped Humble (Matthew Maher), all while 
sharing nights with his roommate, a middle-
aged Egyptian recluse named Muqtada (Bernard 
White).

Equally neurotic patients that populate 
Argenon include a post-Patriot Act schizo-
phrenic and Solomon (Daniel London), a 
Hasidic Jew who can no longer tolerate noise 
after an ill-fated acid trip. 

One side effect of this madcap ensemble is 
that the film only has time to glibly skim over 
these characters. In crafting “Funny Story,” 
Boden and Fleck sought to avoid the cynicism 
and sarcasm of modern teenage films and to 
instead pay tribute to the idyllic John Hughes 
films of yore (namely “The Breakfast Club”). 
But, while the characters in those ‘80s films 
are so well-developed that they render the plot 
inconsequential, “Funny Story” brings together 
half-developed characters and a half-developed 
plot that, in the end, amount to a half-hearted 
coming-of-age tale.

The only believable and sympathetic patient 
that Craig befriends is Zach Galifianakis’ (“The 
Hangover”) Bobby. A self-described Doogie 
Howser in his own right, Bobby steers Craig 

clear from his depression, just as Craig unin-
tentionally returns the favor as the two become 
friends. In lieu of Bobby’s green sweater that 
“smells like a hobo’s Band-Aid,” Craig donates 
his uppity dad’s collared shirt and preps Bobby 
for a group home interview. 

That two-way mentorship did not carry 
over off-screen. “There was no really, like, 
‘Keir, alright I’m going to teach you the ropes 
now,’” Gilchrist said of his relationship with 
Galifianakis. “There were a lot of people who 

were mentors on the 
set, and Zach was 
just one of them.” 

To be sure, 
Keir’s placid look of 
naiveté does a lot 
for his character. A 
Justin Long look-
a-like, the young 
actor maintains 
a bored, deadpan 
face throughout 
the film that was 
probably intended 
to resemble angst. 
If we’re supposed 
to interpret him as 
being emblematic of 

the everyday teenager, it serves Craig well. The 
teenage tendency to punctuate spoken sentences 
with “ums,” “you knows,” and “sort ofs,” shows 
that Keir still has a ways to go before reaching 
the thespian fluency of his veteran counterparts. 

Galifianakis, on the other hand, proves to be 
the redeeming factor in this otherwise manic 
disorder of a film. What drew the screwball 

comedian toward the dark side of drama was 
Bobby’s complex temperament. “He’s fragile and 
a little bit on the edge,” Galifianakis said. “And 
also, he has the capacity to be angry, so it wasn’t 
really a departure from real life.” 

Full-bearded as ever in “Funny Story,” 
Galifianakis insists — teasingly of course — that 
he can’t shave off his mane of fame. 

“I have a terrible skin affliction,” he said. 
“I have a port wine stain in the shape of India. 
No, I don’t know why the beard is such a thing. 
People are so focused on it. I’ve had it for 20 
years. You save 15 more minutes of sleep if 
you’re a man and you don’t have to shave it. It’s 
kind of from laziness.” 

The film is equipped with the right cast, 
including the sadly forgettable Viola Davis, yet it 

squanders any potentially brilliant performances 
in search of a middle ground between comedy 
and drama that it never quite finds.  

At the very least, the message of “Funny 
Story” — to stay grounded, to not internalize 
our problems and to seek consolation in those 
around us — strikes a chord with college stu-
dents. Galifianakis himself can empathize. 

“I think the pressure of the college student is 
ridiculous,” he said. “It’s crazy and hard. When 
I was in school, there was a lot of pressure — 
more pressure than any other time in my life, 
which is why I never really liked school. This 
‘keeping up with the Joneses’ kind of mentality 
that Western society has adopted — it’s bad. It’s 
good for people who work with ulcers. Chillout, 
young ones. Chill out.” “He’s fragile and a little bit on edge. 

And also, he has 
the capacity to 
be angry, so it 
wasn’t really a 
departure from 
real life.

by sending a header past Bronco goal-
keeper Sarah Rohman off a free kick 
by Johnson. The goal was Ilg’s fifth 
of the season, making the graduate 
student the team’s top scorer.

Going into the second half, the 
Tritons maintained their 2-0 lead. This 
was quickly cut down, however, by a 
singular effort from substitute Valerie 
Strawn, who shot a lofted ball into 
the far post to beat Triton junior goal-
keeper Kristin Armstrong.  

 Momentum swung to the Broncos 
with the goal, as they frustrated the 
Tritons in possession and continued to 
outshoot UCSD. Twelve minutes later, 
Pomona forward Jennifer Rivera col-
lected the equalizer when she capital-
ized on a missed clearance within the 
Triton goal box.

With the score now tied and a little 
over 15 minutes left in the match, head 
coach Brian McManus looked to his 

bench for offense, putting McTigue 
and Ilg back on the pitch.  However, 
it was the defensive pairing of Wilson 
and Johnson that would put in the 
winning goal in the overtime period.  

“With 20 seconds left in overtime, 
[McManus] called for a hero,” Johnson 
said, regarding her seventh assist of the 
season. “But I was more like the Robin 
to [Wilson’s] Batman.”  

In the dying moments of the match, 
Johnson swung a corner kick into the 
goal box, where senior midfielder Lisa 
Bradley received it. Bradley fired a 
hard shot, which was blocked by the 
Pomona goalkeeper. Wilson picked up 
the deflection and buried a sure strike 
to end the game.

“My first goal of this season could 
not have come at a better time,” Wilson 
said. “Scoring the game-winning goal 
was relieving more than anything after 
we let Pomona come back into the 
game second half. I was just in the 

right place at the right time to rebound 
the ball into the back of the net.” 

The Tritons came out of the two-
game campaign 4-2-2 in conference 
play, moving them up to the third spot 
in the CCAA South Division. The 
squad is now unbeaten in their last 
five matches. 

This weekend UCSD will take on 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal 
State Los Angeles — two Southern 
California rivals.

“It’s the biggest weekend of the 
season,” Johnson said. “I think we’re 
ready. We’re finally getting our groove 
on.”

UCSD will be taking a road trip to 
challenge Cal State Dominguez Hills 
on Friday, and on Sunday will look 
forward to a match against nationally-
ranked Cal State Los Angeles.

was very rewarding and made the

Morton followed up his record-
breaking 21 saves in the win over 
Concordia on Oct. 2 with six saves 
over Pepperdine and 12 saves over 
LMU. 

“It’s always important that we 
play really well as a team,” Harper 
said. “We’re generally not even near-
ly as big as a lot of the other teams 
— we’re actually relatively small 
compared to most of our oppo-
nents. That being said, obviously 
our goalie, David Morton, had a

take on No. 8 Long Beach State. The 
game will be on Friday, Oct. 8 at

“We’ve won three in a row and 
we’re now going to play a very, very 
large and good Long Beach State 
team,” Harper said. “It’s going to 
be huge for us. You’re looking at a 
Long Beach team that only lost to 
Stanford by a goal, and so it’s going 
to be an opportunity for us to hope-
fully play a really, really good game 
in front of a really, really big crowd 
again.”

Tritons Move to Third in CCAA South Division With Pair of Weekend Wins
By Rachel Uda
Staff Writer

The women’s soccer team collected two 
more hard-fought wins this weekend, shutting 
out Cal State San Bernardino for a 2-0 victory 
and rallying for a dramatic 3-2 win over Cal 
Poly Pomona in overtime.

The Tritons dominated the run of play 
against the Cal State San Bernardino Coyotes 
in their first conference home game of the 
season, picking up an important win that 
pushed them past the Coyotes in the confer-
ence rankings.

Playing in front of a packed crowd, the 
Tritons set the tone from the beginning of the 
match.  In just the third minute of play, sopho-
more defender Hayley Johnson sent a corner 
kick into the goal box, where junior midfielder 
Annie Wethe sent a well-placed header past 
Coyote goalkeeper Tiffany Mallick. The goal 
was Wethe’s second of the season, and marked 
Johnson’s fifth assist.

Johnson said she had anticipated being 
relied upon to consistently provide effective 
free kicks.

“Coming into the season, I knew I would 

have a big role in set plays, and I have practiced 
hard over the summer to try and get them 
right,” Johnson said.  

Johnson went on to rack up two more 
assists over the weekend, both of which result-
ed from set play opportunities.  

UCSD’s early strike deflated the Coyote 
play, setting the stage for another Triton goal, 
this time from junior forward Sarah McTigue.  
McTigue capitalized on a botched clearance 
from the Coyote defense, scoring from six 
yards out in the 23rd minute.

The goal from McTigue secured the Triton 
victory, moving UCSD to 3-2-2 in conference 
play.

“Our luck finally took a turn and we were 
able to put the ball in the back of the net to 
win the game,” sophomore defender Ellen 
Wilson said.

The Tritons carried the momentum from 
Friday’s win into their match against the Cal 
Poly Pomona Broncos on Sunday, converting 
their first goal just five minutes into the game.  
McTigue, recently named the CCAA Player 
of the Week, gave the Tritons a 1-0 lead as she 
flicked a deflection off a rebound from a hard 
shot by senior forward Annette Ilg into the net.

The Tritons maintained the majority of 
possession throughout the half, although they 
were outshot 7-3. However, UCSD made the 
most out of their limited opportunities, and 
Ilg doubled the Triton lead in the 19th minute

The UCSD golf team left behind the rain and 
disappointing overall team results in Washington, 
but returned with high hopes for the team’s prom-
ising newcomers. 

The Tritons competed at the Western 
Washington Invitational on Sept. 27-28, with 
UCSD coming in 11th out of 15 schools compet-
ing. Freshman Jacob Williams led the Tritons 
individually — placing 7th overall — while senior 
captain Keith Okasaki finished tied for 45th.The 
team ended with a score of 891 in the three-round 
tournament.

“It rained the entire time we were there, and 
we had a few bad breaks in the rain,” coach Mike 
Wydra said. “But with Keith [Okasaki] playing so 
well and Jacob [Williams] coming through, we 
just need to find a few other people who are on 
their game at the same time.”

Williams finished the first round with a total 
of 69, shooting par on the back nine, then catch-
ing fire when he moved to the front nine. He fin-
ished with four birdies and an eagle on the round. 
The freshman scored a 76 in the second round 
and a 70 in the third round. Williams ended with 
a one-under-par 215 for the tournament — good 
enough to place seventh.

 “He has potential,” Okasaki said. “It’s a good 
place to start.”

Okasaki had the second best score for UCSD, 
finishing 10 strokes behind Williams with a score 
of 225. He won the Northern California Golf 
Association Valley Amateur Championship on 
Sept. 20-21 and said he was expecting to do better 
in the tournament. 

“I didn’t have the game I needed to compete 
up there,” Okasaki said.

The top individuals for the tournament were 
Western Washington’s Brian Barhanovich and 
Sonoma State’s Patrick Bauer, who each scored a 
9-under par 207.

For the Tritons, sophomore Justin Gabbert 
finished one stroke behind Okasaki with a 226, 
while freshman David Smith carded a score of 
228.

Although the Tritons are off to a rocky start, 
Okasaki has high hopes for the rest of the season.

“We’re pretty young, but we did bring in 
a group of pretty good guys,” Okasaki said. “I 
expect us to do better than the last couple years. I 
think we have a chance to do something well and 
hopefully we can take advantage of that.” 

The Tritons will return to action for the 
InterWest Wildcat Classic on Oct. 11-12.

Triton Water Polo Gets Huge Wins Over Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount
By Hanna Rahimi
Contributing Writer

WATER POLO — The UCSD men’s 
water polo team finished strong in 
last weekend’s SoCal Tournament, 
with two wins in close matches 
against perennial powerhouses 
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount 
Universities. 

“Pepperdine, of course, is annu-
ally a very, very strong team, fully-
funded scholarship program, and 
they’re generally very, very good,” 
UCSD head coach Denny Harper 
said. “We obviously had some good 
momentum still going from the pre-
vious day and we played great.”

Senior driver Bryce Madsen and 
sophomore utility Brian Donohoe 
gave the team a strong start in the 
Sunday morning Pepperdine game, 
scoring two goals each for the 
Tritons. Although UCSD led 3-1 
at halftime, the Pepperdine Waves 
made a comeback in the third quar-

ter and scored five goals to bring the 
match to 6-5 in favor of the Waves at 
the end of the quarter. 

The final minute in regulation, 
the scoreboard showed the teams 
tied at 7-7. 

“Brian Donohoe got a huge goal 
that put us up by two with 51 sec-
onds left,” Harper said. “After that, 
Pepperdine called a time out and it 
was just all about making sure that 
Pepperdine did not get a quick goal.”

The Tritons were able to hold 
Pepperdine off in the final minutes 
of the match, and UCSD took the 
victory. 

“Pepperdine has some outstand-
ing players and we just did a great 
job defensively,” Harper said. “We 
got some key goals and some key 
moments, and it was really, for the 
most part, a one-goal game the 
entire way.” 

The evening match with Loyola 
Marymount progressed in a similar 
manner, with a 3-3 tally at the end 

of the first quarter. Despite a 5-4 
Triton lead entering halftime, the 
teams found themselves stuck in a 
6-6 tie entering the fourth quarter. 

In an excellent show of defense, 
UCSD prevented Loyola from scor-
ing the entire fourth quarter. Senior 
driver Ryan Allred brought the 
Tritons ahead, and his goal ended 
up being the game-winner. 

“The theme for the entire 
day was just playing outstanding 
defense,” Harper said. “Obviously it 
was a little concerning to start the 
tournament giving up 22 goals to 
Stanford on [Saturday], but we got 
our defense in check.”

The SoCal Tournament, hosted 
by UCLA, featured some of the top 
programs in the nation.

“It was more of a thrill and way 
more fun to play really close games 
with teams that were ranked higher,” 
junior goalie David Morton said. “It
