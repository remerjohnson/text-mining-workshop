"A Message To 
The Grass Roots~~ 

By Malcolrn X 
Ediled "ilh a I) refacc b) 
"ike and haron lI aney 

We are presentiDg tbis message from Malcolm to tbe readers 
of tbe TRITON TIMES iD tbe bopes of broadeDiDg tbe 
understaDdiDg of tbe Black maD's burdeD iD America aDd all 
over tbe world. It is aD off·tbe-cuff cbat, Dot to be scrutiDized 
for grammatical perfectioD, Dor to be taken as an attempt to 
wideD tbe gap bet weeD black aDd wblte, but ratber to be read 
witb iDtellectual curiousity and empatby. It is furtber hoped 
tbat you members of the majority can see tbe plight of tbe 
minority aDd provoke yourselves sometime in your lives to pay 
Abe LiDcolD's debt of forty acres and two mul es; we also bope 
tbat tbe members of tbe minority will cease to be a 
maoifestatioD of "a bouse divided ... caDDol staDd." So read 
along wltb us for the next few issues and get mad, laugh, or 
cry, but foremost... THINK aDd FEEL. 

Mike & SharoD 
PART I OD Unity 

And during the few moments that we have left. we want to 
have just an off-the-cuff chat between you and me, us. We want 
to talk right down to earth in a language everybody here can 
easily understaand . 

We all agree tonight (all of the speakers have agreed ) that 
America has a very serious problem. Not only does Amenca 
have a serious problem. but our people have a serious problem. 
Amenca 's problem is us. We're her problem . The only reason 
she has a problem is that she doesn 't want us here. And every 
time you look at yourself, be you black , brown , red . or yellow, 
a "so-called egro." you represent a person who poses such a 
senous problem. for America. you 're not one Once you face 
thIS as a fact . then you can start plotting a course that will 
make you appear intelligent instead of unintelligent. 

What you and I need to do is to learn how to forget our 
differences . When we come together . we don 't come together 
as Baptists or MethodIsts . You don 't catch hell because you 're 
a Baptist , and you don 't catch hell because you're a Methodist. 
You don 't catch hell because vou 're a Democrat or a 
Republican You don't catch hell because you're a Mason or an 
Elk. and you sure don 't catch hell because you 're an Amencan. 
cause If you were an Amencan . vou wouldn ', catch no hell. 

You catch hell because you 're a black man . you catch hell I all 
of us ca tch hell 1 for the same reason . 

So we are all black people , so-called Negroes . second·class 
cllIzens. ex·slaves You 're nothing but an ex-slave! You don t 
like to b told that. but what else are vou? You are ex-slaves' 
You dldn 't come here on the Mavflo~;er . You ca me here on a 
slave ship In chains. like a horse. 'or cow. or a chicken: and vou 
were brought here by the people who came here on 'the 
Mayflower You were brought here by the so-called Pilgnms 
or .. foundmg Fathers." They were the ones who brought ~·ou 
here 

We have a common enemv . we have thIS in common We 
havl' a common oppressor. a common explOIter. and a common 
dlscnmlnator So once we all realm' that we have thIS common 
enemy. then we umte on the basis of what we have 10 common 
And what we have foremost in common, is that enem y. the 
white' man He 's an enemy to all of us I know some of yOU all 
thlOk that some of them ar n't en mies Time WIll tell . 

In Bandung. back in . I think . t954. was the first unit~, meeting 
10 centuries of black people and once you tudy what happened 
at the Bandung Conference. and the results of the Bandung 
Confcrencc It actuallv serves as a model for thc same 
pr<x'cdure you and I can use to get our problcms solved At 
Bandung all the allons came together . they were dark 
nations from Africa and ASia . Some uf them were Buddhists. 
some of them were Muslim . some 01 them were Christians. 
SU IlIC of them were ConfUCIanist. some were atheist. DespIte 
their religiOUS dIfferences. they came together . Some were 
commuOlsts. SOCialists . capIta li sts . despite their economic and 
politIcal dllferences . they came together . All of them were 
black. brown . red . or yellow. The number one tiling that wasn 't

man ; he couldn 't come. Once they exc luded the white man 
found that they could get together ; once they kept him 
everybody else fell right in and fell in line. 

This is the thing that you and I have to understand : 
people who came together didn 't have all of the 
armaments that the white man has; but they had unity . 
were able to submerge their little petty differences and 
on one thing : that one African came from Kenya and was 
colonized by the Englishman ; and another African came 
the Congo and was being colonized by the Belgian ; and another 
African came from Guinea and was being colonized by the 
French ; and another came from Angola and was being 
coloni zed by the Portuguese. 

When they came to the Bandung Conference. they looked at 
the Portuguese, the Frenchmen , the Englishmen. the Outd. 
and realized that they all had one thing in common : the\, 
were all from Europe, blond, blue-eyed , and white skin. Thei' 
began to recognize who their enemy was . The same man wa 
colonizing our people in Kenya, the Congo, in South Africa . In 
Southern Rhodesia, in Burma, in India . in Afghanistan, and in 
Pakistan ; they realized that all over the world where a da rk 
man was being oppressed. he was being oppressed by the white 
man. Where the dark man was being exploited. he was beIng 
exploited by the white man 

So they got Logether under this basis that they had a common 
enemy. And when you and I here In America who have b en 
awakened today. look around us , we too realize, here In 
America , we all have a common enemy , 

Whether he 's in Georgia or Michigan. whether he's In 
Ca lifornia or New York, he's the same man ; blue eyes , bl ond 
hair. and pale skin ; the same man. So what we have to do IS 
what they did , stop quarreling among ourselves. Any little spat 
that they had, they settled it among themselves . Go into a 
huddle ; don 't let the enemy know you have a disagreement 
Instead of airing our differences in public, we have to reali ze 
we're all the same family . And when you have a famll" 
squabble you don't get out on the sidewalk . If you do. 
everybody calls you uncouth. unrefined , uncivilized, savage If 
you don 't make it at home, you settle it at home : you get in the 
closet . argue It out behind closed doors. and then when YOU 
come out on the street you pose a united front. . 

And this is what we need to do, in the community , and in the 
city and in the state. We need to stop airing our differences In 
front of the white man . Put the white man out of our meeting. 
number one, and then sit down and talk "shop" with each 
other. that's all we gotta do. 

PART II On RevolutioD 
. I would like to make a few comments concerning the 

dIfference between the black revolution and the egro 
revolution. There 's a difference! Are they both the same, and If 
they 're not. what IS the difference? First. what is a revolution " 
Sometimes I'm inclined to believe that many of our people are 
UStng thIS word revolution loosely without taking careful 
con ideration what this word actually means. and what it 
historic characteristics are. When you study lhe histOriC 
nature of revolutIOns. the motIves of a revolution . the 
objectives of a revolution . the result of a revolution . and the 
methods used in a revolution . you may change words . you may 
devise another program ; you may change your goal and you 
may change your mind 

Look at the American Revolution In 1776 : That revolution 
was for what' For land! Why did thev want land' 
Independence! How was it car ried out ? Bloodshed ! umber 
one. it was based on land , the baSIS of independence. And the 
only way they could get I\. was bloodshed . 

The French Revolution . Wi:u was it based on? The landless 
againstlhe landlord . What was it for? Land ! How did they get 
It? Bloodshed I 'Twas no love lost. was no compromise, was no 
negotiation. I'm telling you. you don 't know what a revolution 
is. 'cause when you find out what It is . ~'ou ' lI get back in the 
alley : you 'lI get out of the way. 

The RUSSian Revolution : What was it based on' Land~ The 
landless against the landlord . How did they bnng it about ' 
Bloodshed ! You haven 't gOI a revolution WIthout bloodshed . 
and you 're afraid to believe. I say YOU 're afraid to believe. 

A long as the white man sent YOU to Korea - vou bled. He 
sent YOU to Germanv - vou bled . He sent you to the South 
PacifiC to fight the Japa nese - ~'ou bled. You bleed for while 
people. but when ,You see your own churches bemg bombed . and 
!tttle black gIrls being murdered. you haven 't got any blood 
You bleed when the white man sal's ble('d : vou bite when the 
white man says bite. and you bark when the white man savs 
bark . I hate to say this about us. but it 's tru e

' 
How 're you going 

to be non·violent in MIssissippi . as violent as vou were in 
Korea ? How ca n yOU justif~' being non-VIOlent in MississiPPI 
and Alabama when your churches are being bombed. and vour 
little girls are beIng murdered. and at the same time you golO~ 
to get violent with Hitler and To)o and somebody else that ~' ou 
don 't even know ' 

If VIolence IS wrong In Amenca. vio lence is wrong abroad. If 
It 'S wrong to be VIOlent. defending black women. children. 
babies. and men. then It'S wrong for Amenca to draft us and 
make us VIOlent abroad in defense of her . And If II IS nght for 
Amenca to draft us. and teach us how to be \-lOlent in defense 
of her. then it is right for yOU and me. to do whatever IS

necessary. to defend our own people, right here in Amenca. 
The Chinese Revolution - they wanted land . They threw the 

British out, along with the " Uncle Tom " Chinese. Yeah they 
did - they set a good example. When I was in prison, I read an 
article in .... (don't be shocked when I say I was in prison -
you stin in prison- that's whaL America means. prison ): when 
I was In prISon, I read an article in Life magazine showing a 
little Chmese gIrl . mne years old ; her father was on his hands 
and knees and she was pulling the trigger. 'cause he was an 
.. Uncle Tom " Ch inese. When they had the revolution over 
there . they took a whole generation of " Uncle Toms" - )U t 
WIped them out. And within 10 years, that little girl became a 
full-grown woman - no more " Toms" in China . And today it's 
one of the roughest , roughest, most feared countries on thIS 
ea rth - by the white man. 'cause there are no " Uncle Toms" 
over there .... 

Of all our studies. history is best qualified to reward all 
research: and when you see that you've got problems . all vou 
have to do is examine the historic method used all over 'the 
wor ld by others who had problems similar to yours . And oncp 
you've seen how they got theirs straight. then you know you can 
get yours straight. There's been a black revolution going on in 
Afnca. In Kenya the Mau Mau were revolutionanes . The\ 
were the ones who coined the word UH URU - lhey were the 
ones who brought it to the fore - the Mau Mau - they were 
revo lutionaries - they believed in scorched earth ':" they 
knocked everything aside that got in their path. and thei'r 
revolution also was based on land. 

In Algeria a revolution took place. The Algerians were 
revolutionists - they wanted land . France offered to let them 
become integrated into France . They told France to hell wilh 
France! The~' wanted some land , not some France. And they 
engaged in a bloody battle. 

So I cite these various revolutions, brothers and sisters. to 
show you - you don 't have a peaceful revolution : you don 't 
have a turn·the-other-cheek revolution. There 's no such lhing 
as a non-vlolenl revolutton. The only kind of revolution that is 
non-violent. is the Negro Revolution. The only revolution ba ed 
on lOVIng your enemy, is the Negro Revolution. The only 
revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter. a 
d('segregated theater . a desegregated park . a desegregated 
public toilet Iyou can sit down next to white folks on the toilet ) 

that's no revolution - revolution is based on land - land is 
the basis of all independence, freedom , ju tice and equality 
The white man knows what a revolutIOn IS : he knows that the 
black revolution is world wide in scope and nature. The black 
rcvolution is sweeping Africa and Asia . It's raising its head in 
LJlIn America . The Cuban Revolution Revolution - that's a 
revolutIOn! They overturned the system. 

Hevolulton IS in Asia , in Africa , and the white man is 
srreaming because he sees revolution in Latin America . How 
do I'OU think he will react to you when you learn what a real 
rt'volution is? You don 't know what a revolution is - if you did 
vuu wouldn 't use that word. A revolutIOn IS bloody, revolutIOn 
j, hostile, revolution knows no compromIse, revolution 
overturns and destroys everyt hing that gets in ItS way. and you 
nting around here like a knot on the wall say 109 I'm going to 

101'1' these folks no matter how much they hate me. No. YOU 
n('ed a revolution' 

Who ever heard of a revolution where they lock arms singing 
we hall overcome"? You just don 't do that in a revolution -

IOU don't do any singlOg. you 're too bu y winging. 
It 's based on land! A revolutionary wants land 0 he can set 

up hIS own nalion . an independent nallon. These Negroes 
aren't asking for any nation . they 're tryi ng to crawl back on the 
plantation. When you want a nation , that's called nationalism 
When the white man became involved tn revolution in this 
country against England . what was it for ? He wanted this land 

~o he could set up another white nation. That 's white 
n,j tlonalism : the American Revolution was white nationalism 

~, was the French . The Russian Revolution too - yes . it was 
~hite nationalism - YOU don 't think so, wh y do you think 
Khruschev and Mao could never get their heads together ? All 
the revolullons that are taking place in Africa and Asia are 
L.tsed on what? Black natIOnalism. Those revolutionaries are 
hl,lck natIOnalists. A black nationali t wants a nation. If you 're 
afraId of black nallonali m. vou're afraid of revolulion , and If 
IIIU love revolutIon , YOU love black nationalism .

STUDENT : 
What would your reaction be If someone asked you to help out 

in a tutoring program for grade-school kids down to La JoUa? 
" Whal? Me, tutor a bunch of nch La Jolla kids . for notbing? 

With my work load? You 're not sertous
'
" Is that your 

reaclion ? 
Well. let's explore the facts: in the first place. these are not 

"rich La Jolla kIds" : thev're mlnonty kIds. almost all realll' 
eager to learn. Sure. there's no money in It: but people from 
high school through old age are dOing it. just the same Why? 
Well . it's worthwhile, emotionally rewarding, productIve. and 
fun. and if an hour 's the only time you have to gIve lof course . 
if you want to volunteer more, we won 't dI ssuade YOU I 
Anybody who got into thIS place shculd have premo fair 
competence in reading . arithmetIC. geography, etc. and as 
for the .. too busy " line - well. yOU don 't HAVE lime. I'OU 
MAKE lime for something worthwhile. All these kid need IS a 
little personal attentIOn , a IILtie encouragement there 's 
nothing dumb about any of them 

And when you hear that the child you 're about to tutor IS a 
problem child in arithmetic then watch hIm. WIth a lillie 
encouragement. rip through fraction and long-diVISion 
problems that would 've made you pause : or take a problem 
reader and watch him enthusiastically tear through SIX 
chapters of a reading text - well . that's a feeling of personal 
accomplishment and prtde that 's hard to descnbe 

We believe that what we're dOing IS good and wortbwhile 
and the more volunteers we get. the better and more 
productIve the program will be Try and ht some lime mto 
your schedule to help out . you won't regret It

I am amazed that the

obVIOusly only trYing to POint

Ms London has succeeded In 
bringing to the surface another

SDPD Interview ... 
Continued from Page I 

WR: So t~ e n the agreement the UniverSity 
had with th ' previous chief is no longer in 
effect. 

CHIEF : V. ell , I wouldn 't say that it doesn't 
hold. Certainly my people have been abiding 
bvi t. 
. WR: Do yeu perceive any problems wi th the 

campus community? 
CHIEF : No. 

Informants 
WR : Another issue of concern to students 

throughout the nited States. has been thp use 
of informa nts. What IS the SDPD's policy in 
regard to the use of undercover agents? 

CHIEF : Well, I'll answer in this way. we are 
as effective a our source of informatio n. Now 
vou sav undercover officer , what is an 
informant? It could be a housewife . it could be 
a doctor. it could be a professor. 

WR: Do you actively recruit paid 
lOformants' 

CHIEF : We don 't recruit and hire 
informants. I am not aware of any I paid 
informants on college and high school 
campusesl . and If I was I wouldn 't tell you .. 

WR: Do vou ever pay informants for 
information' 

CHIEF: You have to recognize many 
thmgs the Federal Government can pay up to 
580.000 10 mugglmg cases. and certaInlv my 
budget prohibit my becommg Involved In that 

t~pe of expenditure We have on occa Ion . and 
";" e do when the opportuOity presents Itself. 
prOVide ome subsistence for mformallon 

Convention 
WR: RegardlOg the Republican :'>atlonal 

Convention . Your department made a reque t 
to the Federal Government for $900.000 for 
equipment and traIning That request was 
denIed and vou have SlOce made a 1m lIar 
request for 'several hundred thousand less 
\Vh\' do I'OU feel \'ou r OrIginal reque t wa 
denied . and do you 'thlnk I'our new request Will 
be granted ' 

CIII EF : 1m hopeful that It Will be accepted 
but >ou must realize somethlDg that we did not 

know at the time of the request was that the 
government had only provided a $1 million 
fund for both conventions, and Miami was 
given $400 thousand, which left us with less 
than our original request . . . 

WR: What reductions did you make In your 
new request? 

CHIEF: Just reduced some of the overtime, 
some of the travel, and contingency funds. 
WR: Have you met with groups planning 
demonstrations? 

CHIEF: I personally have not met with 
them. 

WR: What plans are the police making? 
CHIEF: Well . we' re making lots of plans. 

We are in phase two at the present time. 
WR : What was phase one? 

CHIEF : The SellIng up of va rious 
subcommittees tu asses thei r particular area 
of responsibility and come back and report to 
use what their 'overall needs would be. These 
plans are now being refined and by May 1 we 
should have our tota l planning scenario ready 
to go . 
WR : Can vou tell us any plans which are being 
made? . 

CHIEF : I can·t. I can speqk in generalities . 
It would be fool hardy of me to discuss plans in 
depth . 

WR : What po LUre IS the police department 
taking as far as attitudes towards any 
demonstrator who might come to the city? 

"Abiding Responsibility" 
CHIEF: Well. I think the posture we have to 

take IS that I have an abiding responsibility to 
protect the communit)'. I am not gOIng to turn 
the city over to demonstrators . You see. 
thev 're'going to be here for a short period of 
turie I hope to be here for many years . The 
reSidents of thiS commUnIt\' are entitled to 
protection. 
WR : Do vou antlticpate makIng any requests 
to other police agencies for additIOnal 
manpower' 

CHIEF : I really can 't tell yOU at this time. 
We don 't know what kInd of a gathering we are 
gOing to have . We are a participant 10 a mutual

SDPD Interview . . . 
CoDtlDued from Pale 6 

aid pact statewide and if necessary we can call 
upon these agencies to assist us. 

WR: How do you expect your response to be 
different from that of, say the Chicago police 
department in handling demonstrators? 

CHIEF : I am not going to criticize or 
second-guess any other police agency. 
Hindsight is phenomenal. I think our problems 
are going to be different than Chicago·s. 
Times are different, attitudes have changed. 

WR: Then you believe people will be cooler 
in San Diego? 

CHIEF: I think there is ample indication 
that people will be. 

WR: Will you be making efforts to keep 
people out of San Diego? 

CHIEF: Constitu tionally I can not preclude 
people from entering the city. 
WR: Have you offered to allow demonstratar~ 
to camp anywhere? 

No Offers Made 
CHIEF: We have not made any offers The 

permits can be issued six months in advance. 
We are not going to issue any permits for 
anything, if permits are issued, unti l probably 
J une. 

WR: Permits may not be issued? 
CHIEF: It 's a decision we haven 't made yet. 
WR: Why are you waiting unt il June to issue 

permits? 
CHIEF: There are many reasons We do not 

know what the present status of the political 
atmosphere might be . . . assume, just 
assume, that violence erupts nationwide Then 
certainly we are not going to encourage 
hundreds of thousands of people to come into 
San Diego. We are not going to make any 
determinations until that point 10 time. 

WR: Have you had any contact with 
citizens' groups such as the American Civil 
Liberties Union concerning the convention? 

CHIEF: I haven't, my staff has. There is 
close liaison with different groups 

WR: There are reports that the police are 
picking up persons in the beach areas on minor 
violations so that they will be out of the way 
for the convention. Is that true? 

CHIEF: Thatis pure hokum. 
WR : What are your feeli ngs concerning field 

interrogation? That IS, the policy of 
questioning suspicious persons routinely? 

" Oae of The Greatest Tools" 
CHIEF: Field InterrogatIOns are probably 

one of the greatest tools law enforcement has 
at its hands if used properly . You can look at 
any statistical data you want and as field 
interrogations go down the crime of burglary 
goes up. It IS quite obvious a man who is bent 
on committing a CrIme, once he has been 
stopped by a police officer and hiS name is 
taken he sure as heck IS not gOIng to contInue 
that criminal endeavor, at least in that 
location. because we have got him pInned 
there 

WR : Are field interrogation forms used to 
compile dossiers on citizens? 

CHIEF : If the man has a crImmal record we 
have a dossier on him . 

WR : What is your opinIon of law 
prohibiting the use of marijuana' 

CHIEF : Well , I look alit thiS wa\'; If the law 
is on the statutes I'll enforce it. If It'S not on 
the statutes it's not up to me to wonder why 

WR : Do you have any personal feelIngs on 
the matter. one way or the other' 

CHIEF : I feel the use of narcotics shou Id not 
be condoned. I would not agree With the 
legalIzation of it But I don 't legislate 

WR : What IS the policy of the SDPD 
regarding the use and posseSSIOn of 

, 

marijuana? 
CHIEF: We arrest everybody that has 

marijuana. it's as simple as that. 
WR: The marijuana laws seem to be 

selec llvely enforced at limes, for mstance at 
large gatherIngs of youth 

CHIEF: Well , you have to be realistiC. If I 
were to go to a rock festival and there's ten 
thousand people and I'm there by my elf. you 
know I'm not stupid . and I'm not gomg to go In 
and make an arrest for fear of starling a 
major rIOt. But I do not condone It I marIjuana 
use I. 

WR: If the use of marIjuana IS so prel'alent 
that you do not have the manpoy;er to enlorce 
the law rIgorously. what do you thInk the 
solutIOn shou ld be . Increasing the size of the 
force to cope with the problem or some other 
solution? 

CHIEF: Well, I would hope that the 
communIt> and the publIc y;ould become wise 
enough that they wouldn 't fInd 11 npees. an' to 
use narcotics. You see. preventIOn IS much 
better than apprehenSion and pro ecullon 
Educallon I thmk , IS the an y; r 

Interrogation of Higb School Studenls 
WR : Is It the policy 01 the OPD to 

Interrogate high school student. at school' 
CHI EF: You 're obvlousl)' approachmg the 
legality of it , It certaml\ IS y;ell Within the 
confm d of the educallondl code And I 
support It wholeheartedlv 

WR: Is It ethical for the SDPO to 
Interrogate student essenllallv b(>hInd the 
parents back? 

CHIEF: Yes. It'S ethical 
WR: You don 't see anythIng unethical about 

questIOnIng a mmor behind hiS parents' back" 
CHIEF : We're not gOIng behmd the parents' 

back we re gomg to the school where he 
happens to be at that pOint 10 tlmt' 

WR : Why couldn t th~ questIOning bt 

conducted at the home m the presence of the 
parents? 

CHI EF: Because when th( officers receive 
their case they go to work In the daytime and 
the youngster Just happens to be at school We 
do nolifv the parents dUrIng t~.e mterVICY; 

WR: Do you think thIS IS Important enough
