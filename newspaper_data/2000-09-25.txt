Activist Group Destroys 
Genetically AHered Plants 
Mexican group calling itself "Children of the Com" brag on 
Web about wreaking havoc at a UCSD greenhouse 
By BRIAN WEllES 
Senior Staff Writer 

Researchers and lab workers are busy 
replanting after sabateurs raided a green-
house at a UCSD biology field station last 
month, causing $100,000 in damage. 

An activist group from Mexico known as 
"Los Ninos del Maize" or "Children of the 
Corn; took credit for the act on its Web 
site. 

The vandals hopped a fence and broke 
into the campus facility on the night of Aug. 
25, causing major damage to genetically 
modified maize, stalks of sorghum, oak 
seedlings and several other native plants. 

Vandals overturned poned plants and 
pulled pollinatiQn bags from their proper 
locations in an effort to mix up test results. 

They also spray-painted ~Los Ninos del 
Maize" on the window of the building. Also

and the universal anarchist symbol, a cir-

A night security guard has been hired to 
deter any further intruders with intentions 
to disrupt the facility'S research. 

"It's too bad that we're locking the barn 
door after the horse is gone," said Wayne 
Hewitt, a lab technician at the field station 
who reported the incident to police. 

According to Hewitt, the direct action 
group did not appear to target a specific

ones were uprooted, and the damaged 
plants were chosen arbitrarily. 

Most disheartening for Hewitt was the

Health Insurance 
to be Required 
for Admission 
uc Regents respond to 
dropout statistics with new rule 
and accompanying health plan 
., LAURIN I. COAIITNEY 
News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents made a prece-
dent-setting authorization for UC President 
Richard C. Atkinson to make health insur-
ance a new undergraduate admissions 
requirement starting fall 2001 . 

The decision comes in response to 
growing numbers of health-related 
dropouts. 

According to a report presented at a July 
UC Regents meeting, about 40 percent of 
undergr.tduates do not carry health insur-
ance or are currerltly uninsured, and 25 per-
cent of dropouts occur due to health-relat-
ed issues. 

The University of California loses almost 
9 percent of its incoming freshmen during 
their first two years due to illness. 

. The leading reason for this, according to 
the report, is lack of health insurance. 

All graduate and international students 
in the UC system are already required to 
carry health insurance, and undergraduates 
at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz must 
meet the same requirements. The new deci-
sion will force the other seven UC campus-
es to follow suit. 

While the requirement will be waived for 
those presenting evidence' of adequate 
health insurance, a new health insurance 
plan offered by each campus will fulfill the 
requirement for students who have previ-
ously chosen to go without it. 

The regents have provided a model plan, 
but according to regents spokeswoman 
Mary Spletter, it will be up to each campus 
to come up with its own plan that will tit the 
needs of its students. 

"The campuses will have to design their 
own plan. We are not handing one Ollt. Each 
campus needs to perform studies and analy-
ses to determine what they need for their 
students," Spletter said. 

The model plan provided by the regents 
is estimated to cost students between $400

Davis Signs Bill Giving More Money to Deserving Students 
Governor claims new legislation wiU allow most students to go to college regardless of finandal situation 
ASSOCiate News Editor 

Gov. Gray Davis signed new 
Cal Grant legislation Sept. 12, 
guaranteeing financial aid to any 
high school $tudent with a cumu-
lative grade point average of at 
least 2.0 money to anend colles,e. 

"We are ecstatic over this bIll: 
said UCSD's Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joe Watson. ·We 
felt a passion for this bill and it 
was clear everyone felt a deep per-
sonal commitment to it: 

Watson is also the Chairman 
of the State Student Aid 

Commission. 
According to the commission, 

over 130,000 students are sharing 
$503 million this year from Cal 
Grants A and B, while funding is 
expected to increase to $1 .3 bil-
lion. Over 250,000 students are 
expected to receive Cal Grants by 
2006. 

·This will eliminate the argu-
ment that students can't afford to 
go to college: Watson said. ·AII 
they need to do is get a B or a C 
and they will have expenses 
paid ." 

Cal Grant A is designed for stu-
dents with a minimum GPA of 3.0 

and whose parents make less than 
$64,100 per year. Students who fit 
such criteria will be guaranteed 
over $1,428 for California State 
University campuses, $3,429 for 
University ot California schools 
and up to $9,708 for private uni-
versities. 

Those . students with a mini-
mum C average and a family 
income of less than $33,700 will 
be guaranteed Sl,551 to anend a 
community college and be eligible 
later for aid to a four-year univer-
sity if they wish to transfer. 

college, some believe it will not 
significantly impact the enro ll -
ment at UCSD. 

"It seems like the demanding 
requirements to get into UC San 
Diego would prohibit these new 
students from attending this 
school: said Muir sophomore 
Jesse Brand. "Even though they 
have the grades to get the money, 
they still need a 4.0 to get into

ContInued from ,... 1 

of the grants will be attending schools 
with less stringent admission require-
ments. 

·Where you will see the biggest 
jump will be in the state and commu-
nity colleges: he said. "UC students 
already have the GPA needed to 
receive a Cal Grant." 

The new Cal Grant program rep-
resents a substantial change from 
last year 's policy under which the 
number of students receiving money 
was based on student grades and the 
amount of money available for the 
program. 

Now all students who qualify will 
receive money, regardless of how 
many others received similar grants. 

"I like how the unfair competition 
has been taken out of applying for the 
grants: said Marshall sophomore Eric 
Robin . "Students who come from 
schools where getting good grades is 
easier were more likely to get money 
than those who went to a harder and 
better school." 
: Last year, over 40 percent of the 
applicants who fulfilled the require-
ments and applied for one of the 
grants did not receive one due to the 
lack of money allocated to the pro-
gram. Such problems have apparently 
been eliminated. 

"This is a landmark change," 
Watson said. "[t speaks to the state's 
commitment to facilitate and assist all 
students to obtain a college degree." 

The governor believes that about 
one out of three high school graduates 
will now qualify for a new Cal Grant 
and attend college. 

"The money for this program will 
be committed if students choose to 
take advantage of it," Watson said. 
"The state of Cal iforn ia is saying to 
people that education is imponant." 

The new Cal Grants are espeCially 
imponant for those entering the job 
market. As the boom of the economy 
increases, salaries rise dramatically for 
those who have graduated from col-
lege. 

Thirty years ago, individuals who 
had a college degree earned about 50 
percent more than someone with just 
a high school degree, while the per-
centage today has ballooned to over 
70 percent. 

Watson said the implementation of 
the new Cal Grants will directly affect 
and improve the u.s. unemployment 
rate while continuing to help grant 
recipients make good salaries. 

"There is a need to go to college 
for earning power, and the data sup-
ports [the ideal that people have 
greater economic success with a col-
fege degree," Watson said. "College 
degrees will also make an individual 
more employable." 

One reason Davis decided to allo-
cate funds for the new Cal Grants was 
data concerning the amount the state 
spends on building state penitentiaries 
each· year. 

According to Watson, over twice 
as much is spent building prisons 
each year than is curren tly given to 
students to attend a school of higher 

learn i n~ . 
"Th iS money [for the new Cal 

Grantsl is well spent," he said. " [t is a 
good social policy as well as a good 
individual economic pol icy."

percent of top students from each high school to 
attend a UC school. 

The plan is in accordance with the Master

Nudity Proves to Be 
Fiscally Fit 
Getting the most satisfaction for very little cash 

Stop 
That! 

BERTRAND FAN 

It has recently become a goal 
of mine to discover an activity 
that is free, entertaining, satisfying 
and productive. [f for an episode 
of "Family Feud" I were to survey 
100 people, [ suspect they would 
come up with the following 

_responses: sex, walks along the 
beach, masturba-

Since we are on top of the sub-
ject and have it spread out before 
us, let us take a closer look at sex 
and see if it is a good fit for these 
requirements : Entertaining? 
Unquestionably. Satisfying? 
Quite. Productive? A qUick VIStt 
to a maternity ward would answer 
that one. 

As far as blowing your wad is 
concerned, though, sex is one of 
the most expensive activities you 
can get into. Quite frankly, you 
are going to be whipping out your 
hard-earned cash for more than 
you can shake a stick at: contra-

ception, lubrica-
tion, reading in a 
bookstore or a 
library, and beating

There(ore all of these activities

Unfortunately, state and feder-

along most beaches naked and 
reading books at a bookstore or

will have to give those the shaft. 

masturbation is

PLUR Mantra Abounds at Raves 
Parties offer a haven of friendship and respect, ..not an orgy of drugs 
By JACQUEUNE CHEUNG 
Staff Writer 

[ have received varying 
responses when [ tell people 
that [ am a raver. . 

Some, usually open-minded. 
fun-loving, young people, are 
cool with it, citing the merits of 
trance, light shows and the 
ever-present PLUR (peace, love, 
unity and respect), which is the 
mantra of all ravers. Others 
cannot disguise the twinge of 
disgust in their vO.ices as they 
say, "Oh, you 're a raver?" 

Now, [ was not born a glow-
stick queen. [ am an average 
UCSD student. [ love the beach 
and loathe midterm season . [ 
like to go chtbbing and am 
counting the days until [ turn 
21. 

[ fell into raving about six 
months ago when a friend 
encouraged me to go to a rave 
in Los Angeles just to check it 
out. I went with many reserva-
tions and found. to my surprise. 
that I loved the carefree haven 
of lights. music, people. atmos-
phere and everything it stood 
for, 

My world expanded because 
of the raves themselves. the 
people I never would have met 
otherwise, and the bond.s [ 
secured with my close friends 
through raving. 

As a result, I kept going. I 
learned how to use glowsticks 
and photon lights. [ bought 
raver gear and purchased glow-
sticks en masse. [ got into 
trance, looked up raver Web 
sites and chatted with fellow 
ravers online. 

[ will admit it is much more 

than just a hobby for me. It is a 
way of life. People often treat 
me with derision when I tell 
them this. 

Ravers are often stereotyped 
to be young people with an 
altered fashion sense and mis-
placed ideals, looking for trou-
ble. 

Raves are stereotyped to be 
drug-infested parties. the epito-
me of all that is wrong with 
today's youth . 

Those who denounce 
raves may not realize 
that it is not just a fad 
or something to do. 
Simply speaking, rave 
culture is a part of 
youth culture. 

[ make no apologies for 
being a raver. and here are my 
reasons, 

Raves are said to be danger-
ous. yet we can find more men-
aces to society at the top of the 
corporate ladder, in the minds 
of many of our nation's leaders 
and in the police force. Ravers 
are said to be disillusioned. 
unfocused. immoral drug 
addicts who wear funny clothes. 

I beg to differ. 
F.irst of all, the striking out-

fits are merely a form of expres-
sion. [n terms of the troubled 
youth. [ consider myself to be 
reasonably normal and have 
many fellow raver' friends who 
lead normal lives. Many are 
already established in their 
vocations or are headed toward 

promising careers as doctors 
and lawyers. Some of them. in 
fact. do no t touch drugs such as 
ecstasy. 

I th ink the con troversy sur-
rounding raves has partly to do 
with the fac t that ecstasy is usu-
ally associated with raves. 
Ecstasy is viewed by hardcore 
ravers as an optional method of 
enhanci ng the experience. 

Composed of va rio us phar-
maceut ica ls. ecstasy produces 
enhanced se nsa tions and 
peaceful. em pat hetic and ener-
getic fee lings. Lig hts flow 
together. massages feel like 
heaven. you feel loved when 
surrounded by your fri ends. and 
for the most part, all of your 
problems seem miles away. 

I am not promoting nor 
denouncing ecstasy. [ merely 
want to say two things. First. 
ecstasy is viewed as a mere 
enhancement of the rave expe-
rience and the PLUR that 
comes with it. Second. not all 
ravers take ecstasy. and it is very 
possible to enjoy the lights. 
music and atmosphere without 
ever touching drugs. 

Raves can be thought of as 
the modern-day. new-age 
branch of the "living in harmo-
ny· and "peace and love" hippie 
scene from the ' 60s. 

Those who denounce raves 
may not realize they are not just 
a fad . Simply speaking. rave cul-
ture is a part of youth culture. It 
has gone global , spread ing 
everywhere from the United 
Kingdom to Japan to America. [t

tures, fusing with the hip-hop

C .................. 
opinion. This practice goes 
beyond abortion and [he death of 
the fetus and touches on defiling 
the dead f~tus. Was it not enough 
that the fetus was aborted, a sad 
process in itself? Now it has to be 
used for an experiment? 

This is an issue similar to the 
use of the organs of people who 
died in car accidents for trans-
plants. For public notice, I did not 
put that little sticker on my driver's 
license allowing my body to be cut 
apart for transplants. 

The main difference between 
these two issues is that in one case 
a choice is involved, in the other it 
is not. While the adult driver 
could choose to allow his organs 
to be used, the fetus did not 
choose to be aborted, and as an 
ultimate insult, did not choose to 
be experimented on. 

Choosing to abort the fetus is in 
the full right of the woman, but 
choosing to use the fetus for exper-
iments is a privilege that belongs to 
no one. 

To answer the next two ques-
tions of protecting the mother and 
the holTtndous possibility of actu-
ally harvesting fetuses, some recent 
news should be looked at. 

Over the summer, the Clinton 
administration unveiled guidelines 
that would not only make th~ prac-
tice .of using fetuses for research 
legal, but also federally funded. 

While I am against this, it also 
means that U.S. scientists are also 
bound by law to remove stem cells 
from the fetuses using only feder-
al funds and to enact the research 
in an acceptable way, whatever 
that may mean. To do otherwise 
would mean going to prison. 

While Roe v. Wade and, to some 

extent, Planned Parenthood pro-
teet the right of a woman to hav~ 
an abonion, these niles estab-
lished by the administration can-
not fully protect women. They 
cannot proteet women from the 

p~pect of money. 
What these embtyonic expeti-

ments crea te. besides a possible 
panacea, is a black market for fetus-
es. It is very possible that some 
deranged women would be willing 
to get pregnant for the sole purpose 
of selhng their fetuses to corpora-
tions and scientists. The law would 
prohibit such despicable actions. 
but there are still ways. 

Some would argue that no sane 
biotech corporation would be wiU-
ing to accept an aboned fetus 
through the black market. Note, 
however, that this law applies only 
to companies in the United States. 

. Dozens of foreign nations are cur-
rently looking into embryonic stem 
cell research. 

Because of such constraints, 
companies will obviously be hard 
pressed to find an adequate supply. 
Consider the possibility of actually 
harvesting fetuses for research , 
which brings out even more moral 
and ethical questions. This sounds 
more like an uX-Files" episode than 
an actual possibility, but a possibil-
°ity it is. 

Using aborted fetuses is one 
thing. Growing them en masse is 
simply appalling. most likely even 
to propon~nts of embryonic stem 
cell research. Though this writer is 
not a religious person. let me use 
an old cliche: The scientists would 
be playing God. Creating organs 
and test tube babies is far different 
than creating life in mass quantities 
only to destroy it for research. 

As Dr. Anton-Lewis Usala tes-
tified before a Senate subcommit-
tee on September 15, "science is 
an all-consuming fire: 

tlsala, who works for Encelle, a 
company which studies treatments 
for type I diabetes. said that 

Monday, September 25, 2000 

embryos will eventually be created 
for research purposes. 

Mit will happen. There is no 
doubt. It cannot be legislated: he 
told the subcommittee. 

This leaves the scientific com-
munity in a quandary. Embryonic 
stem cell research is an exciting and 
very promising field. It offm so 
much in terms of finding cures for 
Parkinson's disease. Alzheimer 's. 
multiple sclerosis and other dis-
eases. The main question IS 
whether to abandon this promising 
field. What is more important, the 
preservation of the sadly aborted 
fetus or the possibility of savmg a 
person's life? 

Admittedly, stem cells from 
fetuses are optimal to use because 
they. are in tile earliest stages of 
development. However, the possi-
bility of using adult stem cells still 
exists, only it is more difficult to do. 

Dr. Darwin Prockop, director 
of Tulane Univc;rsity's center for 
gene therapy, told the Senate sub-
comminee that, while his research 
on usmg adult stem cells has been 
promising, the actual trials will 
not be performed for at least 
another two years. 

From a moral point of view. this 
seems like a much more acceptable 
solution than harvesting fetuses 
like some type of agriculture. 

George Bernard Shaw once 
said, "You do not senle whether 
an experiment is justified or not 
by merely showing that it is of 
some use. The distinction is not 
between useful and useless exper-
iments, but between ~arbarous 
and civilized behavior." 

Though inevitably linked to 
abonion and a woman's right to 
choose, embryonic stem cell 
research stretches funher into the 
morality of scientific research . 
Even though abonion is a neces-
sary evil , it certainly does not 
mean the aboned fetus should 
simply be tossed away and used 
for research in a laboratory.

Being a raver is not about

In Underwhelming Turnout, Frelich Voters 
Cut Their Country'. Presidential Term 

PARIS - A referendum to cut 
the French president's term of 
office from seven to f'i ve years was 

. overwhelmingly approved Sunday 
,though a record number of voters 
did not bother to cast a baUot. 

The shonened term, the most 
radical change to France's con-
stitution in 40 years, was 
approved by 73.2 percent of 
those who cast a ballot for or 
against, according to provisional 
results. But only 30 percent af 
those eligible voted, the lowest 
turnout ever,_ 

A low turnout had been 
expected as surveys in recen t 
weeks showed that the issue had 
failed ro capture the interest of 
many voters. Some said the issue 
was too complex. But others said 
they wert being asked to vote on 
an issue that was of interest only • 
to politicians, far afield from 
pressing concerns like high taxes 
and the cost of fuel. 

Indeed , even some who voted 

went out of their way to express 
disdain for the referendum. 
Eighteen percent of those who 
showed up, more than 1.8 mil-
lion voters, did not vote but 

A low turnout had 
been expected as 
surveys in recent weeks 
show that the issue has 
failed to capture the 
interest 'of many voter. 

instead returned empty 
envelopes or envelopes stuffed 
with a ripped-up ballot. 

The shoner term - which 
will put parliamentary and presi-
dential elections on the same 
five-year schedule - ' has been 
debated in France for nearly 30 
years, Supporters have argued 

that the seven-year term is too 
long in a fast-changing world. 
Some also say it will cut down or 
eliminate awkward periods of 
"co-habitation" like the one 
France is experiencing now, with 
a president and prime minister 
from different parties, often 
working at cross-purposes, 

Many of those who showed 
up to vote Sunday said they felt 
used by politicians, who were 
asking them about something 
that seemed irrelevant. 

Eric Stern hac, an editor who 
lives in Paris, said he returned a 
blank envelope. 

"There are so many ques-
tions that are more important to 
us - taxes, the state of educa-

Dreamworks Entertainment Company 
Scales Back its Once-Grand Vision 

As described in October 1994, 
the dream was a new-style enter-
tainment company in which 
three of the most successful peo-
ple in the business would have 
total freedom to create films, TV 
shows and music albums. while 
also developing new-media 
enterprises. 

So bold and exciting were the 
plans laid out by Steven 
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and 
David Geffen that many publica-
tions put articles about them on 
page 1. The "dream team," as 
they called themselves, named 
their company DreamWorks 
SKG. 

But after six years that saw the 
rise of the World Wide Web, the 
proliferation of digital music and 
the advent of digital television, 
the bold DreamWorks trio has 
found true success only in 
Hollywood's oldest and financial -
ly riskiest profession - making 
movies. 

To be sure, what DreamWorks 
does well, it does exceedingly 
well. Through early September, 
the 20 films it had released since 
1997 had averaged 578.7 million 
at the box office, a batting aver-
age some 15 percent ahead of any 
other studio, according to the 
research firm ACNielsen EDt. 
And those hits included two mul-

"This is not the best 
arena for us to make 
money. But it is the best 
arena for us to do what 
we do with the least 
amount of interference. " 

-o.vkI a.rt., 
Co-founder of Dreamworks 

tiple Academy Award winners: 
1998's "Saving Private Ryan" and 
1999's "American Beauty: 

Yet, in creative fields other 
than films, the dream team has 
worked little magic. ABC's · Spin 
City" is the only TV hit to have 
emerged from DreamWorks. 

In music, the industry where 
Geffen made his name and 
money, DreamWorks expects 
revenue of $1 00 million this year, 
which he said was ahead of the 
pace his former company 
achieved in its early years, Still, 
DreamWorks has but one album, 
Papa Roche's "Infest," among 
Soundscan's top SO. 

As for new media, the 
DreamWorks trio has had to 
learn the meaning of a word pre-
viously unfamiliar to them: flop. 
Last month, after spending at 
least 57 million to develop 

http://Pop.com, an entertainment 
Web site, DreamWorks and its 
panner in the venture, Imagine 
Entertainment, terminated the 
business before the Web site had 
even opened. 

And so, for better or worse, 
these days "we're essentially in 
the movie business," Geffen said. 

While acknowledging that 
they had scaled back the original 
DreamWorks plan, Dreamworks 
executives betray little disap-
pointment over their curbed 
ambitions. 

"[ would say that [ wish we 
were more lucky or better," 
Katzenberg said of DreamWorks' 
limited success in network televi-
sion. But like Geffen, he spoke 
not of failure but of changed 
business circumstances. 

And the founders note that 
DreamWorks would not be the 
kind of company to stan if the 
point was a huge payoff. "If we 
were simply about where is the 
most amount of money for us to 
make, we wouldn't be in this 
area," Geffen said. "This is not 
the best arena for us to make 
money. But it is the best arena for 
us to do what we do with the 
least amount of interference. '

ment did not constitute a binding 
commitment, but financial offi-
cials presented it as tangible 
progress before the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
holds a meeting in Caracas, 
Venezuela, this week. 

"The committee is concerned 
that current oil prices, if sus-
tained , could hamper global 
growth, add to inflationary pres-
sures and adversely affect 
prospects for many countries,· its 
communique said . 

Finance min isters gathered 
, here for the annual meetings of 

the monetary fund and the World 
Bank hope that their sustained 
oratorical campaign against" a 
530-plus barrel price for oil will 
have a marked impact on a 
volatile cOfTImodity market that is 
sometimes moved by psychology 
and speculation. 

But they have so far been 
unable to announce concrete 

meet. 
Samuel W. Lewis, who was 

ambassador to [srael between the 
years of 1977 and 1985, said : 
"There are scores of us, hundreds 
of us who have done similar

way to do your job."

ered important· to the Middle East

acknowledged to lawmakers that 
the handling of classified material 
was a problem with many ambas-
sadors, 

"Ambassadors ought to be able 
to work with classified materials 
in their residence," he said, 

[n [srael , the treatment of 
[ndyk, the first Jewish-American 
ambassador there, was greeted 
with disbelief. A senior Labor 
Party politician, Eitan Haber, said 
that if similar violations were 
investigated in Israel , "half the 
government would be in jail right 
now." 

Investigators have made clear 
that Indyk's case does not involve 
espionage or the compromise of 
any confidential material.

steps that would lead to a grea ter 
supply of oil by winter. Sunday's 
communique, like one released 
Saturday, praised the United 
States' decision last week 10 tap 
its substantial strategic oil 
reserves to help dampen prices. 
But though the statement noted 
that othe~ nations would also 
consider using emergency 
reserves to increase supply, none 
had made such a commitment by 
Sunday. 

As expected, the nations that 
control the fund backed a plan to 
provide debt relief to 20 nations 
by the end of this year, up from 10 
that have already been' granted 
relief. 

The effort, intended at least in 
part to head off demands from 
protesters, requires that the mon-
etary fund and the World Bank 
ease some conditions they have 
imposed on debt relief in the past. 

The nations also approved 
changes to the fund 's lending 
programs designed to preserve th~ 
fund 's capital for crises and wean 
it away from some long-term 
lending to more financially stable 
nations. The overhaul was pushed 
by U.S, Treasury Secretary

Some See Politics Behind Clinton's Decision to Release Oil 
HOOKSETT, N.H. - The first 

twinges of orange and red had 
already ap~rcd in the woods 
when Arlelgh Greene and John 
Noone gathered with their wives. ' 
children and some friends on 
Sunday for what they called a 
wood pany. 

The men traded off a chain saw 
and an ax while the women and 
children tossed split logs into the 
bucket of a bulldozer, ready to 
dump the load into a truck. 
Concerned about the rising cost 
and limited supply of heating oil, 
they Wert hoping to .tore a larger 
supply of firewood this year than 
tast. 

-I'm scared of not 'getting 

deliveries," said Greene, a used-
truck dealer from Hampton Falls, 
N .H. who heats his house with oil 
and wood, about eight cords a 
winter .• , want to keep the house 
warm SO the pipes don't freeze." 

Even though he has heard that 
some local fuel suppliers are 
already running low on oil, 
Greene scoffed at President 
Clinton's decision to release 30 
million barrel. of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum ' Reserve, 
which was established in 1975 
after the Arab oil embargo. 

-I'm totally against it," he said, 
adding that he suppona. Gov. 
Georsc W. Bush for president. "'

political. There's no doubt in my 
mind . I'm for everything that 
makes it easier for the poor, and 
especially the elderly. But they 
had I chance to do this a year ago 
and they didn't." 

In I state where the presiden-
tial race is too close to call and 
where most residents heat their 

homes with oil, strong opinions 
like Greene's are not difficult to 
find . 

Of more than two dozen peo-
ple intervi~wed Sunday about 
Clinton's move, nearly all had a 
firm opinion on this issue. But 
few said the decision would sway 
their vote. 

Like Greene, many voters here 
called it pure politics when, ·so 
close to Election . Day, .vice 
President Al Gore said last week 
that oil from the reserve should 
be used to increase supply and 
reduce prices, and Clinton fol -
lowed through, ordering the 
release of 30 million barrels of the 
570 million barrels of crude oil in 

the national reserve. But many 
considered the use of the reserves 
as a necessary and practical mea-
sure. 

New Hampshire consumers 
have reason to be concerned 
about a possible oil shortage, In 
New England, there are only six 
million barrels of heating oil in 
commercial inventories, com-
pared with 16,3 million barrels 
last year, according to the 
American Petroleum Institute. 
The six million barrels are less 
than a 10-day supply under nor-
mal usage.

UCSD to Recognize Disability 
Awareness with Celebration ': . 
People with disabilities will perform and entertain in an effort to raise 
conscienceness about people with visible disabilities and other handicaps 
I, .IICCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

An annual three-day celebra-
tion of abilities will be held start-
ing Oct. 10 to observe disability 
awareness at UCSD. 

The events will begin at 11 :30 
a.m. and continue until 1 :30 p.m. 
in the Price Center Plaza, where 
guitarists and vocalists will per-
form . 

There will also be a question-
and-answer discussion with the 
entertainers .about disabilities and 
drawings for prizes. 

Barry Niman, the manager of 
the employment rehabilitation 
program and coordinator for the 
.Acmericans with Disabilities Act, 
said the events will "showcase 
the talents of people with disabil-
ities and influence people's 
awareness of those with disabili-
ties." 

Niman said he hopes that the 
events will change the attitudes 

and behaviors of people with and 
without disabilities. 

The events will also involve 
people with nonvisible disabilities, 
such as depression and attention 
deficit disorder. 

The Disabled Student Union 
and the Community Advocates 
for Disability Rights and 
Education will host infonnation 
booths, and Mama's Kitchen will 
be collecting food for people 
affected by AIDS. 

More musical performances, 
prizes, give-a ways and infonna-
tion table sessions will occur Oct. 
11 from 11 :30 a.m. to 1 :30 p.m. in 
the grassy area between Torrey 
Pines Center North and Torrey 
Pines Center South on North 
Torrey Pines Road. 

On Oct. 12 the movie 
"Compensation" will be featured 
in the Price Cente'Theatre. The 
movie is about the life of a deaf 
African-American woman in the 
early 1900s, paralleling another 

woman living in the 199Os. The 
movie is free with :t valid ID card 
and will be shown at 7 p.m. and 10 
p.m. 

Niman said the events are 
intended to help educate the pub-
lic about visible and nonvisible 
disabilities and to help disabled 
students feel more comfortable at 
school. 

He said it is also an opportuni-
ty for disabled students, staff and 
faculty to get their needs 
addressed and infonn the univer-
sity of what their needs are. 

The disability awareness 
events are sponsored by Business 
Affairs Vice Chancellor Steven 
Relyea, UCSD's Employee 
Rehabilitation Program, the 
Office for Students with 
Disabilities, the Community 
Advocates for Disability Rights 
and Education, and the Disabled 
Student Union, with the support 
of the University Centers 
Advisory Board.

Collegiate: 
Students gave no reason 
for burning flag 
CoIItIn •• , ......... 1 
painted in yellow across the front. 

The men encourdged students 
to follow them to the fountain in 
front of Dodson Auditorium, where 
they cut the flag into four strips. 
doused each strip with lighter fluid 
and set them on fire, as they stood 
on the rim of the fountain. 

The men held the burning 
pieces in the air, dropped them to 
the ground, and then left the quad, 
without saying a word or giving a 
reason. 

They later refused to provide 
their names or give a purpose for 
buming the flag. saying they will 
make a statement after they see 
student reactions. 

About SO students gathered for 
the demonstration, which they 
watched with mixed reactions. 
Some clapped and cheered, while 
others just walked by. 

Many students- who gathered 
said they were surprised to see the 
flag-burning take place and they 
had differenJ i~eas as to why the 
men would bum the flag. 

LSU's Student Senate decided 
last November to pass a bill sup-
porting the (;SU administration's 
decision not to endorK a purple 
and gold Confederate flag. 

However, senators amended the 
original bill, which called for the 
Senate to deny support for the flag, 
which many students said they 
considered controversial and 
offensive. Some said the Senate 
watered down the bill.

LOS ANGELES - With televi-
sion continuing to be the public's 
most powerful influence and 
source of news, many local activist 
groups are working to unite view-
ers and improve television for this 
and future generations. 

A meeting of such groups on 
the University of Southern 
California campus Thursday 
focused on what they and the gen-
eral public can do to influence the 
government's decisions on how to 
regulate the rules of the Federal 
Communications Commission, 
especially with the move toward 
digital television. 

As television moves from analog 
to digital, there will be more ways 
to communicate through the air-
waves, said Mark Lloyd, an advo-
cate for civil rights in communica-
tion policy. 

However, the media giants are 
instead focusing their attention on 
convincing Congress to allow them 
to use this new digital tuhnolottY for 
free. according to literature from 
The People for Better Tv. Despite 
the movement toward digital televi-
sion, broadcasters are still narrow in 
their spectrum of presentatio!ls. 
speakers said. Areas of major con-
cern are representations of cultural 
diversity and presentations that are 
mindful of children's best interest. 
With broadcasters spending about 
$10 million on lobbying io 
Washington in nearly one year, citi-
zens need to have a voice in deter-
mining what is aired, speakers said. 

Since broadcasters do not pay 
for television licenses, they almost 
always choose to use television for 
purposes other than the improve-
ment of society, they said. 

At the meeting, there was a con-
sensus that minorities and women 
are-<under-represented in television. 
which often focuses on specific 
subgroups within cultures and dif-
ferent generations rather than pro-

a nation in East Africa. 

Los Ninos del Maize argue 
. that genetically altered plants are 
a threat to earth's biodiversity. 

However, last month's break-
in did not appear to constitute 
an effort to support such a 
cause. 

On its Web site, the Mexican 
group released a communique in 
which it claimed to have 
destroyed more plants than were 
actually found ruined. 

-They show a remarkable 
amount of ignorance in that they 
can't tell one plant from anoth-
er; Hewitt said. 

In its Web site manifesto, the 
group called UCSD biology pro-
fessor Robert Schmidt a "bio-
imperialist; and accused him of, 
working to clone and identify 
$enes in floral maize in order to 
Increase profits for multinational 
corporations. 

The Web site also gave an 
exaggerated explanation of what i 
group claimed to have done The 
authors also indicated their con-
cern for gene crossing in maize 

due to its possible threat to the 
agricultural diversity of the 
members' native country. 

The reasons for protesting 
UCSD's research was evident 
through the members' claim that 
only 20 percent of maize once 
grown in Mexico is still .in exis-
tence. due to the hybridization 
and genetically engineered 
replacements of the crop'.

monoculture and plants are only 
part of their experiment; the 
group stated on its Web site. 

In addition, it attacked 
UCSD's California Sea Grant-
sponsored work in the area of 
genetically modified marine 
invertebrates and the university's 
efforts to use transgenics in its 
mouse lab. 

The group claims it strongly 
believes in sparing ecological 
health at the expense of advances 
in biotechnology and potential 
profits for large corporations. 

Attacks on biofacilities began

in Europe before they spread to 
the United States. where an esti-
mated 18 cases were reported in 
1999. 

These "special interest terror-
ists" have struck 11 times in the 
United States so far this year. 

One episode occurred last 
June in Canby. Ohio. wh~n a 
group calling itself the Anarchist 
Golfing Association destroyed 
experimental plots of grass. caus-
ing $300.000 in damage. 

What was similar between the 
two episodes was the response of 
those whose work was 
destroyed. 

Pure-Seed Testing, the com-
pany funding the genetic modifi-
cation of creeping bentgrass. said 
it was trying to assess the pre-
cautionary measures of produc-
ing a new grass. 

Likewise, it explained that 
experimenters were not trying to 
come up with a new product of 
maize, but rather attempting to 
study its cell function and 
growth under genetically altered 
conditions. 

"We are using transgenics as a 
tool for learning about plant 
cells: Schmidt said . "This was a 
very cowardly act. IThe groupl 
could have come and discussed 
this with me, or if they pi'cketed

about this research."

Cutler Selected to 
Lead CONNECT 
San Diego entrepreneur will serve as director for 
UCSD program that encourages local growth 
If ALIX J. UI 
Associate News Editor 

Fred G. Cutler, a local entrepre-
neur. was named director of UCSD 
CONNECT Sept. 13. CON ECT 
is a partnership between UCSD 
and San Diego industry to acceler-
ate the creation and growth of local 
high-technology companies. 

Cutler succeeds the late Bill 
Otterson, UCSD CONNECT's 
founding director. Ouerson devel-
oped CONNECT from a consor-
tium of 28 spon-
sors and compa-
nies to a network 
of more than 800 
members and 
sponsors. 

CO NEtT is 
now nationally r~c ­
ognized as the best 
of its kind in fuel-
ing business 
growth. It has been 
replicated 
throughout the 
world in countries 
including Sweden 
and Scotland. 

According to 
Cutler, UCSD students WIll be 
affe.cted in ways that may not be 
immediately obvious. For instance, 
CONNECT will work with 
UCSD's Irwin tll1d Joan Jacobs 
School of Engineering by assisting 
with the commercialization of 
research and technology. 

UCSD Chancellor Robert 
Dynes believes Cutler is qualified 
for the job. 

"Fred Cutler is an outstanding 
choice to lead this pivotal regional 
program: Dynes said. "His acade-
mic background and his extraordi-
nary track record as 3 high-tech 
entrepreneur will serve him well in 

setting the future course of CON-
NECT." 

Cutler holds a doctorate in mar-
keting research and social psychol-
ogy from the ~niversity of 
Southern California. A founder of 
Web software start-up DigitalStyle 
Corporation, he later worked in 
new business development for 
Netscape Communications after 
the two merged. 

Throughout his career, he has 
been an active board member and 
private investor in various San 

Diego-based start-
ups and CO -<II c: 

o 
.~ ECT companies. 

He has also served .11 § 
E as ~ntreprenellr in

=> ment center. 
'0 "I am excited by 

~ this unique oppor-
~ tunity to help drive 
U the San Diego 

region into the 
national forefront 
of high-technology 
business growth: 

Cutler said. "UCSD CONNECT 
has done a superb job over its 15-
year history. I look forward to 
working with the CONNECT team 
to move this great organization for-
ward." 

Cutler credits UCSD CON-
ECT with acting as a catalyst for 

San Diego's emergence as a center 
for a variety of technology industries. 

"UCSD has the opportunity to 
be even more proactive in driving 
start-ups forward; Cutler said. 
"We've done a great job in the past, 
but I just think there's room to be 
more aggressive in commercializa-
tion ."

Catch a in San Diego 
San Diego beaches offer a little something for everyone 

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 

UCSD is fast becoming one of the most popu-
lar UCs in the system. It was recently ranked No. 
31 in U.S. News and World Report's survey of the 
top 50 colleges in the nation . Although a school's 

. impressive academic ·reputation is a big factor in 
people's choices to attend the school. it is only one 
of the major selling points. As it is with most 
things, location is everything. 

Had this school been in the middle of the desert 
or in the Sierra Nevadas, it is unlikely that it would 
have so many applicants year after year. As it is, the 
many beaches in the area have raised UCSD to 
among the top UCs in the system in terms of 
applications received. 

San Diego is famous for its many beaches that 
attract visitors from all around the world. With so 
many bea<;hes concentrated in one area, it is not 
hard to find one that fits every individual's desires. 

There are 15 major bellChes in the area, each 
with its own appeal. 
........... 

This beach is one of the most popular in the 
San Diego area, as evident by the constant sea of 
beachgoers that flood its sands daily. Mission 
Beach also offers one of the widest ranges of activ-
ities of any beach in the area. 

Mission Beach was the home of MTV's SoCal 
Summer beach house, attracting thousands of 
music fans daily to the already crowded beach. 

The south end of the beach is home to some of 
the most famous volleyball courts in San Diego. 
On most days, professional volleyball players can 
be seen practicing their drills. There are also sever-

al basketball courts available on the south end of 
the beach. 

The north end is usually swamped with beach-
goers, who range from those content with lying in 
the sun to those who toss Frisbees and footballs 
throughout the day. 

A large grassy area complete with picnic tables 
is located directly east of the beach, offering a great 
place to relax and enjoy the day. 

There are generally decent waves on the south 
side of Mission Beach that attract surfers and boo-
gie boarders. The water on the south end of the 
beach has many swimmers as well. 

Mission Beach is also home to Belmont Park, 
which offers a myriad binis to do for the young 
and old. For those intI! tea in cruising along the 
boardwalk, inline skates and bikes are available for 
rent. For children, there is an arcade that sits adja-
cent to a large wooden roller coaster, one of the 
most famous sites on Mission Beach. Other rides 
at Belmont Park include a merry-go-round and 
bumper boats. 

Numerous restaurants at Mission Beach offer a 

wide variety of food, from the fast food of 
McDonald's to the more expensive Canes. 

Mission Beach is located down Mission 
Boulevard, south of UCSD. Belmont Park is locat-
ed at 3146 Mission Blvd . 
'.lfIe ..... 

Pacific Beach, another very popular site, is 
located just to the north of Mission Beach. It is 
home to many popular restaurants, bars and other 
hot spots that are frequented by young people. 

While there is no boardwalk like there is at 
Mission Beach, there are bike paths and picnic 
tables. 

The pier at Pacific Beach is a popular place to 
go for a great view of the sunset. Many also fis h at 
the end of the pier. 

As far as beaches to go to at night, Pacific Beach 
ranks among ihe best. The many fire pits that line 
the beach are usually kept burning into the wee 
hours of the morning. 

T hose interested in gathering around a bonfire 
at Pacific Beach should be sure to arrive early, as 
the spots tend to fill before sunset. 

Pacific Beach is located just north of Mission 
Beach off Mission Boulevard.

This beach is a local favorite among college stu-

The Editor's Soapbox · 
An editor recounts the difficulty ofbeing a commuter at a college that seems to cater to on-campus dwellers . 
., LAURIN I. COMTNIY 
News Editor 

Everybody knows there's some-
thing wrong at UCSD. We have 
excellent research facilities, highly 
distinguished faculty and some of 
the smartest students in the nation. 
However, we also have extremely 
low alumni support. 

The A.S. Council has admitted 
that there is little sense of campus 
community, and many UCSD stu-
dents report dissatisfaction regard-
ing their social lives. 

These sentiments can ring 
especially true for the commuter 
student who goes home every 
night and not only misses the 
after-hours activities, but also 
sometimes feels more like a visitor 
rather than a student here at 
UCSD. 

Commuter students make up 
an estimated two-thirds of the 
entire UCSD community. Many 
of these are transfer students or 
students who have lived on cam-
pus and -have since moved on. 
However, I suspect that many of 
these students are like me, won-
dering where they fit into the sys-
tem that is seemingly geared 
toward those who live on campus. 

When I came to UCSD as a 
freshman, having lived in San 
Diego previously, I opted out of liv-
ing in a residence hall for what I felt 
to be a few simple reasons; the first 
being that I did not want to live in 
a closet-sized room with someone I 
did not know and who could be an 
ax murderer, or worse yet, someone 
who didn't bathe. The second rea-
son was that I was not thrilled 

about sharing a bathroom with 10 
perfect strangers. 

I spent an evening .in the resi-
dence halls during orientation. 1 
went to take a shower the next 
morning and was horrified to see 
a shower stall with two shower 
heads. At that point, I decided that 
I would not be submitting my 
housing contract. 

That was a decision I have 
regretted ever since . . 

Instantly, people treated me dif-
ferently. It seemed like other people 
just knew each other, and I had no 
idea why it didn't work the same 
way for me. 

Welcome Week, I soon learned, 
was not about me. I attended 
events that were mandatory for the 
students in my college and felt like 
an outsider. 

Feelillg this way, I to~k the 
proactive approach and went to 
one of my college's Commuter 
Student Association meetings. I left 
my name, number and e-mail 
address to be contacted about 
upcoming commuter events. I'm 
sure they have perfectly lovely 
events, but to this day I've never 
been informed of them. 

Once the school year got into 
full swing, my feelings of separa-
tion from the rest of the campus 
and what happened within it were 
reinforced by many incidents. 

The most memorable of these 
was in a class that was required at 

'my college. Having been unable to 
attend a section right before the 
midterm - for legitimate reasons, 
I might add - I e-mailed my 
teaching assistant, asking if I 
missed any important announce-

Being a commuter has

nothing to do and 
nowhere to go while other 
students return to their 
residence halls and 
campus apartments to 
nap quietly until their 
next classes. 
ments. He replied in the negative 
and reminded me to keep up with 
the required reading. At the next 
section, I learned that there had 
been an extra review session 
scheduled. I asked my TA why I 
had not been informed, and he 
said that he was sure one of my 
"dorm-mates" would have told 
me. 

Incidents like this have continu-
ally made me feel like I don't really 
belong here because I do, in fact, go 
somewhere else to sl~ep at night. I 

might be oversensitive about these 
issues, but it's difficult not to over-
react to issues a commuter 'student 
faces here, such as parking and 
enduring long hours between 
classes. 

Being a commuter has some-
times meant spending long days 
with nothing to do and nowhere to 
go while other students return to 
their residence halls and campus 
apartments to nap quietly until 
their next classes. 

If a quarter passes where I can 't 
schedule my classes efficiently 
enough, it can mean a lot of list-
less waiting on my part. I can hang 
out with friends or study, but this 
mostly turns out to be unproduc-
tive time. There's always the 
option of leaving and coming 
back, but we all know about the 
cost of gas and how trying to 
locate a parking spot at 1 :30 in the 
afternoon can be an exercise in 
futility. 

. Parking is ' an entirely different 
matter. I cringe when I hear cam-
pus residents complaining because 
they choose to take the bus or ride 
with friends occasionally for fear of 
"losing their parking space." You 
mean you actually have a parking 
space? Must be nice. Every day I 
arrive at school with uncertainty 
about being able to park, and if I 
can't find a space, I can't go to 
class. Enough said. 

I don't want to complain too 
much. UCSD is a wonderful uni-
versity that actually does care about 
its commuters. However, learning 
about the commuter services 
offered can be difficult. The univer-
sity is doing things to make the

Rest, Marshall offers the Center 
for the People, Warren has the 
Shuttle Stop and Roosevelt has an 
area for commuters in its adm in is-
trative offices. 

In addition to finding a place to 
go, getting involved is an exce llent 
way for commuting students to 
ease the isolation . While it's sim-
ple and obvious, it is the best 
advice I can- offer. Not only does it 
allow you to meet more peopl e, 
but it helps fill time between class-
es and can sometim es provide 
another place to go during that 
time. 

Friends of mine who also com-
mute have found working on cam -
pus especially helpful , beca use 
most campus jobs will work 
around your class schedule while 
allowing you to earn money doing 
so. 

Joining a sorority or fratern ity 
and joining clubs are also options 
for commuters to get involved. As 
far as clubs go, there really is some-
thing here for everybody. 

As a commuter student , it has 
taken patience and work to make 
the most of my time and experi-
ence at UCSD. I'm finally begin -
ning to feel that living off campus 
makes me no less of a student than 
those who live here.

Students not Immune to Sun's Dangers 
The threat of skin cancer is ever ... present among youths 
By MALAViKA GANGOLLY 
Associate Features Editor 

Although the summer has offi-
cially ended, millions of Americans 
will continue to spend countless 
hours at the beach in search of the 
"perfect tan: In San Diego, stu-
dents are no exception. 

For UCSD students, living close 
to the beach provides prime 
opportunities to take in the sun's 
powerful rays. What sunbathers 
often fail to take into consideration 
is that such activities may have 
deadly conseq uences. 

According to the American 
Cancer Society, over 10,000 
Americans die annually as a result 
of skin cancer, and many might 
have survived had they taken prop-
er precautions. 

David Causier, M.D., chairman 
of the department of dermatology 
for the Talbert Medical Group, 
debunked some common miscon-
ceptions of the disease in Talbert 
Medical Group press release from 
the month of June. 

"Most people assume that if 
they limit their exposure to the sun 
to short, regulated intervals, the 
dangers and ill effects are greatly 
reduced," Causier stated. 
"Unfortunately, this is.not the case. 
Even exposure in five-minute 
intervals can lead to many health 
and dermatological-related prob-
lems over the years. In fact, expo-
sure to sunlight is defined by a 
cumulative effect, and precautions 
should be taken , no ma ner how 
short the exposure: 
WhIIt I. SkIn CMcer? 

Recognized as' the most com-
mon form of cancer in the United 
States, skin cancer is a disease in 
which cancerous cells are found in 

the outer layers of the skin . 
The most common types of 

skin cancer are basal cell cancer 
and squamous cell cancer. 

A more serious type of skin 
cancer is melanoma, which is 
found in pigment cells that color 
the skin . Melanoma is most often 
found in adults but is also occa-
sionally found in children and 
young adults. 

According to the Center for 

According to the 
American Cancer 
Society, over 10,000 
Americans die annually 

. as a result of skin cancer, 
and many might have 
survived had they taken 
proper precautions. 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
malignant melanoma is the most 
rapidly increasing form of cancer 
in the United States, causing more 
than 75 percent of all deaths from 
skin cancer. 

If malignant melanoma is diag-
nosed at an early stage, it can usu-
ally be cured. However, if detected 
at a late stage, the cancer is more 
likely to spread to the lungs or 
liver, often resulting in death. 

Skin cancer can occur any-
where on the body, but it is most 
common in areas that have been 
exposed to more sunlight. The 
CDC states that the most common 
indicator of skin cancer is a change 
on the skin, such as a growth or a 
sore that will not heal. Often, a 
small lump appears, but all 

changes in skin texture or color 
should be regarded as possible 
signs of skin cancer. 
c.u .. of IIdn c.c. 

Sunburn and ultraviolet light 
can damage the skin, ultimately 
leading to skin cancer. Heredity 
and living environment can also 
affect one's chances of getting skin 
cancer. . 

The CDC states that most peo-
ple receive 80 percent of their life-
time exposure to the sun by the 
time they reach the age of 18. 

Those with a history of skin 
cancer ir: their families are proba-
bly at a higher risk. People with fair 
skin or Northern Euro~n her-
itage are known to be the most 
susceptible to the disease. 

A common misconception 
about tanning is that it prevents 
skin cancer. Tanning is the skin's 
response to UV light, and it does 
not prevent skin cancer. 

The CDC has released infor-
mation suggesting that the level of 
UV light today is higher than it was 
100 years ago (the reduction of 
ozone in the earth's atmosphere 
has resulted in extremely high lev-
els of UV light). 

A United Nations World 
Meteorological Organization press 
release indicates that this year's 
ozone hole showed uthe most rapid 
depletion on record.n 

Since the ozone serves as a filter 
to reduce the amount of UV light 
to which we are exposed, the 
depletion of the ozone layer results 
in a higher level of cancer-inducing 
UV light that reaches the earth's 
surface.

Monday will bring new chal-

lenges. Face them head on . 
Tuesday through Thursday 
should be spent reflecting on your 
inner self. Friday night should be 
set aside for recreation. Let loose 
on Saturday before buckling 
down to get work done on 
Sunday. 

T .... (Aprll20-May 20) 
Being that you are a broke col-

lege student, you will miss out on 
yet another investment opportu-
nity on Monday. Not to worry, as 
Tuesday will bring new financial 
success. You should concentrate 
on classes from Wednesday 
through Friday so that you can 
have some fun on the weekend. 
Don't pass up' any opportunities 
to have a good time on Saturday 
or Sunday. . 

8elllinJ (May 21·June 21) 
The week will seem to drag on 

forever. Classes will keep you busy 
during the . week. Don't try to 
make up for it all on Friday night. 
Take things slowly. Enjoy the 
entire weekend. Remember, good

Cue ... (June 22-July 22) 
Although classes have started, 

don 't pass up an opportunity to 
have a good time earlier in the 
week. You can afford one night of 
fun before Thursday. The week-
end should be spe nt with close 
friends. They are the most impor-
tant thing to you this week. There 
will be plenty of time to meet new 
people next week. 

Leo (July 23·Aug. 22) 
You ' re beginning to miss 

someone a lot this week . No mat-
ter how hard you try, you can't 
stop thinking about them . A sim-
ple phone call will go a long way 
in easing your feelings. Take some 
time later in the week' to go out 
with friends and forget about that 
person for a night. Don't feel 
gUilty about it. They would want 
you to have fun . 

VI .... (Aug. 23·Sept. 22) 
This week you will find that 

you can easily manage your class 
schedule. Challenge yourself by 
taking on new responsibilities. A 
part- time job might be a great way 
to put some extra money in your 
pocket. Be looking early in the 
week. Later in the week is a good 
time to seek employment. 

Ultra (Sept. 23·0ct. 23) 
Love is in the ai r this week. 

You can't stop thinking about that 
special someone. If they don't 
already know how yo u feel, take a 
chance by Wednesday. Let them 
know how you feel. If you do, 
you're weekend will be filled with 
good times. If not, an impending

Beach: 
Local beaches suit the 
interests of students

One reason La Jolla Shores has 
become popular is that it is not as 
crowded as other beaches such as 
Mission Beach and Pacific Beach. 

La Jolla Shores also offers large 
grassy areas equipped with barbe-
cues, and there is a playground as 
well. 

Another reason La Jolla Shores 
has become popular is its proxim-

ed on nice days. It is a popular 
spot for many people, from sun 
bathers to volleyball players and 
surfers. . 

However, parking can be a 
problem at Del Mar Beach. Those 
interested in getting a good spot-
should arrive early, especially on 
weekends. 

Del Mar Beach is located off 
Camino Del Mar in Del Mar. 
Torrey Pines Road turns into

north from UCSD.

Sun: 
Identifying those at the 
greatest risk 
ContInIIed from ..... 20 
cancer, but those with ccruin char-
acteristics have a higher chance of 
developing the disease. 

The CDC data suggests that 
possible risk factors include fair to 
light skin complexion, family histo-
ry of skin cancer, personal history of 
skin cancer, chronic exposure to the 
sun or history of sunburns early in 
life. 

Atypical moles, a large number 
of moles. and freckles - an indica-
tion of sun damage - are also 

.;. : potential signS' of skin cancer. 
Skin type is an imporunt factor 

: .. in eValuating one's risk of skin can-
cer, as well. 
" Skin is typically classified into 
six groups according to its tenden-
cy to sunburn. The National Skin 

. Cancer Organization identifies six 
types. 

Type 1: Someone who always 
bums, never tans and is very fair, 
with red or blond hair and freckles. 

Type 11 : Someone who burns 
-easily and ~ns minimally. This per-
son is usually fair-skinned . 

Type Ill: Someone who some-
times burns and gradually tans. 

. Type IV: Someone who has min-
imal burning and always tans. 

Type V: Someone who very sel-
dom burns. always tans and has 
medium to heavy pigmentation. 

Type VI: Someone who never 
burns but tans darkly. This includes 
those of African descent and others 
with heavy pigmentation. 

The National Skin Cancer 
Organization states that those at the 
greatest risk for skin cancer always 
burn, or burn easily, especially if 
they have blond, red or light brown 
hair, and blue, green or gray eyes. 

In addition, people who have an 
outdoor occupation are at 
increased risk, due to the coAiider-
able amount of time they spend in 
the sun.

routinely used sunscrten lotion. 

Causier stressed the imponance 
of sunscreen use but warns that it 
does not always protect against skin 
cancer. 

"People must realize that sun-
screens are simply filters against the 
effects of the sun: Causier 
explained. "They do not act as a sun 
blocker; therefore they only reduce 
but do not eliminate the long-term. 
cumulative effects of sunlight to the 
skin." 

Causier offered some advise for 
those spending The American 

Academy of 
Dermatology and 
the Skin Cancer 
Foundation suggest 
some simple pre-
cautions that peo-
ple can take to 
red uce their risks of 
skin cancer. 

First. minimize 
exposure to the sun

of 10 a.m. and 3

sun protection factor of 1 5 or high-
er to all areas of the body that are 
exposed to the sun. 

Third. reapply sunscreen every 
two hours. even on cloudy days. and 
reapply after swimming or perspir-
ing. 

Founh. wear clothing that covers 
your body and shades your face. 

Finally. avoid exposure to LN 
radiation from sun lamps or tanning 
parlors. 

Skin cancer is largely preventable 
when these precautions are taken. 
The CDC reports that about 70 per-
cent of American adults do not pro-
tect themselves from the sun's rays. 

According to the results of the 
CDC's 1992 National Health 
Interview Survey. only 30 percent of 
adults sought shade. 28 percent 

r.tr ......... 
Anyone who develops any skin 

abnormality should contact his 
physician immediately. The majority 
of skin cancers, when detected at an 
early stage. can be treated and effec-
tively cured. 

The WMO estimates that over 
14 percent of Americans will devel-
op some form of this cancer during 
their lifetimes. 

One serious sunburn can 
increase the risk by as much as 50 
percent. Therefore. it is imperative 
that all people educate themselves 
about the risks of skin cancer. 

"The key to controlling skin can-
cer is early detection,~ Causier stat-
ed. "With early detection. today's 
treatments are quite effective. When 
undetected. the effects can be fatal."

Thriving Bacteria Taints Many Foods 
Campywbacteriosis can cause illness ifprecautions are not taken 
Associate Features Editor 

Summer provides the perfect 
weather for a day of surfing. 
lounging in the sun and those 
famous beach barbecues. But. if 
you and your friends are planning 
to do a little cooking on the beach 
any time soon. you may want to 
postpone your outing. 

An infection known as campy-
lobacteriosis is becoming increas-
ingly common. especially during 
the summer season. The infec-
tion, which is caused by the spi-
ral-shaped bacterium campy-
lobacter. is transmitted by con-
suming undercooked chickFn. 
unpasteurized milk and untreated 
drinking water. 

The organisms causing the 
infection can also be passed 
from raw meats or raw meat 
drippings to the mouth, by con-
tact with infected dogs and cats. 
from contact with another per-
son with the infection. through 
bacteria passed in the stool of an 
infected person. or handling live 
poultry. 

The disease can infect people 
of all ages. especially those with 
weakened immune systems. 

Stanislaus County Health 
Services Agency officials recently 
received reports of 90 cases of 
campylobacteriosis between 
January and June. 

The National Center for 
Infectious Diseases has found that 
campylobacter is the most com-
mon bacterial cause of diarrheal 
illness in the United States. 

Roselyn Cunningham. com-
municable disease nurse for the 
Stanislaus County Health 

Services Agency, stated in a June 
press release, 
"Campylobacteriosis is an infec-
tion primarily caused when peo-

I pIe eat undercooked food that 
contains the campylobacter bac-
teria." 

Common sources for the bac-
teria include turkey and raw 
milk. but the most common 
source of campylobacter infec-
tions is contaminated poultry 
meat. 

The National Center for 
Infectious Diseases has 
found that 
campylobacter is the 
most common bacterial 
cause of diarrheal illness 
in the United States. 

According to the Stanislaus 
County Health Services Agency. 
one-third to one-half of all raw 
chicken in the market contains 
campylobacter organisms. 

Following exposure to the bac-
teria, Infected individuals may 
notice a number of symptoms, 
including diarrhea or loose stools, 
abdominal pain. nausea, vomiting. 
fever and headaches. 

Symptoms can last for up to 10 
days after the initial infection. An 
infected person can spread the 
disease to others while displaying 
symptoms. and also up to seven 
weeks after the symptoms disap-
pear. 

Stanislaus County officials 
suggest that people avoid con-

suming unpasteurized milk and 
untreated water, wash raw fruits 
and vegetables. cook all poultry 
thoroughly. wash kitchen utensils 
well with hot. soapy water after 
each use. and wash hands after 
contact with pet feces. 

It is also Imperative that food 
handlers. health and child care 
workers not work if they have 
diarrhea. 

Health officials also suggest 
that those who are planning to 
travel outside of the country con-
sult with the health department 
about precautions to take regard-
ing food and water. 

There is no treatment for the 
campylobacteriosis infection 
except the repla~ment of water 
and salts. Physicians recommend 
that those who are infected 
increase their fluid intake in order 
to prevent dehydration. 

. I n more severe cases. physicians 
sometimes prescribe antibiotics. 

According to health officials. 
the infection affects approximate-
ly 2 to 4 million Americans (Very 
year. 

Although the illness is 
uncomfortable. and in some 
cases. causes the infected person 
to be unable to work for several 
days. deaths due to the infection 
are rare. 

It is advised that all people take 
preventative measures to ensure 
that they are not infected. 

People should wash their 
hands regularly after handling raw 
mtet and take extra precautions 
when cooking meat. . 

So if you're still planning that 
beach barbecue. make sure that 
chicken is really cooked before 
you chow down.

Review 

Monday, September 25,2000 

Athlete: 
Hard work paying off 
for Tritons' Boettner 
ConUnueli froaI ..... 31 
had only a six-day break during the 
winter between the end of water 
polo and the beginning of swi~­
ming, and he had to show up tn 
August to start train ing for the 
water polo team. 

Needless to say, the task of bal-
ancing academics and two sports 
can be quite daunting. . 

"It is a challenge to find the time 
to do both school and spend the 
hours in the pool that I need to," 
Boettner said. 

However, at' the end of winter 
quarter, Boettn~r will be g~aduating 
with a degree tn economics and a 
minor in communications. 

When the water polo season 
ends in December, Boettner will 
have a free winter break and an 
open fall quaner to look forward to 
for the first time in four years. Not 
surprisingly, his plans consist of a 
whole lot of nothing. 

"I just want to take a break and 
relax, no exercise for a while; he 
said. 

After four years of standou t per-
formances in swimming and water 
polo, Boettner's break is well 
deserved. 

Column:

gives a damn? There are dozens of 
sports with thousand of athletes, 
and you're telling me about thiS 
guy's popcorn-making skills? 

NBC's announcing crew, other 
than Costas, is unbearable. More 
specifically, Bill Walton and Jim 
Grey ate unbearable. 

I can't stand listening to 
Walton comment on a game. I 
could barely tolerate him talkil1i 
about basketball, a sport he 
knows. But women's water polo? 
His observations such as "They 
must make shots to win the 
game" are so blatantly obvious, 
it's ridiculous. 

I haven't liked Grey since last 
year's World Series, in which. he 
berated Pete Rose during a speci;!1 
moment. Grey is intrusive and his 
questions are mind-numbing. 

"Does it feel good to win the 
gold?W this genius will ask. What is 
the athlete going to say? "No, I 
don't like it, you can have it." No. 
Grey needs to take a little bit m~:m: 
' time in his question phraSing 
before they let him go in front of 
the camera. 

Despite how hard NBC tries to 
make me want to turn it off, I still 
love the Olympics. The idea of the 
world competing for the brother-
hood and sisterhood of mankind, 
getting together for some friendly 
competition, makes me feel good 
inside. 

The other day I overheard a guy 
at high school football game say 
that he was boycotting the 
Olympics because they have grown 
too political. 1i'ue. they are too 
political. If you want' to get any-
thing done, a nice . bribe to. the 
International OlympiC Committee 
will do it, and that is wrong. Only 
greased palms will get anything 
done with those people sitting on 
their thrones. 

But to boycott the Olympics, 
not to watch at all because of this is 
also wrong. It is not the athletes' 
fault . They have a dream and are 
working hard to realize it. 

Seeing Americans stand on the 
podium and receive their gold 
medals and then hearing the 
national anthem is a site to behold. 
The tear in the athletes ' eyes are 
shared with everyone, because the 
summer games are truly special.

Men and women give average showings, but beginners do it job in outperforming lesser opponents 
Sports Editor 

In an early season with a young 
bunch of runners, it is tough to say 
where a 'team is. 

Nonetheless, The UCSD cross 
country team has an idea of its 
place. and it is just fine. 

On Saturday, the . Tritons 
marched up to Riverside to take 
part in the UC Riverside 
Invitational. 

The Riverside Invitational is a

The men run 8,000 meters and 

. the women must finish 5,000 
meters. 

A number of California teams 
were there. ranging from National 
Association of Intercolegiate 
Athletics schools to Division I uni-
versities to club teams. 

The Triton men held their own 
and finished eighth out of 21 teams 
with 256 points. 

The women were not quite as 
successful, but not embarrassed in

USC came out firing in the sec-

With S5 seconds left in the

finishing 14th out of 20 with 374 
points. 

On paper, it looks to be an aver-
age outing for the guys, but a sec-
ond glance at the seven teams 
ahead of them in the standings tells 
a different story. 

University of Southern 
California, University of San 
Diego, Riverside and others of 
comparable skill were ahead of 
the Tritons. All of these schools 
are either Division I or indepen-
dent clubs, racing on a much 
higher level. Cal Coast was first 
with 31 points. • 

UCSD was the top finisher for 
all Division II schools. 

USD placed sixth and San 
Diego's Point Loma Nazaren~ 
came in 11 th o 

The top Triton finisher was 
Neil Kalra , who came in 32nd 
with a time of 26:49.0. John

er, coming in 46th with a time of 
27:06.0.

With 3:36 left in the founh 
quarter. the Tritons were granted a 
huge opportunity. On a great 
counterattack by UCSD off a USC 
man advantage, the Trojan goalie 
was given a 20-second ejection . 
With a fresh goalie in the net and 
down 4-S, UCSD had a chance to 
even the score. 

USC set up a wall of defenders 
to help out its new keeper and 
presented the ~CSD attack with a 
wall of anns that was difficult to 
penetrate. 

The Thtons moved the ball back 
and forth, and then the shot just 
missed over the top post. 

On the counterattack USC 

formances: Van Arsdale said. 
"John Wong lead the pack for quite 
some time. The art of racing that 
long is th-at you have to concen-
trate on the task at hand.w 

Nik Bringleson finished in 
27:39.9 and Mike Wangler in 
28:05.1. To round out the top five, 
Jason Stone ran a 28:06.0. 

The strong point of the men's 
run was their pack time of 77 sec-
onds, mc:aning UCSD's top five 
finishers all finished within 1:1 7 of 
each other. 

"The tighter you are, the better 
you'll do: Van Arsdale said. 

UCSD women are a young 
bunch and are just honing their 
skills. 

The top woman Triton finisher 
was Julie Pope, who finished in 
59th with a time of 20:29.4. 

The second Triton to come 
across the line was Laurel Casey, 
with a time of 20:44.90 . Next was 
Bridget Bertino in 20:52.10 and 
Carol Schweichler in 21 :44.9. 
Erin Uyeshima brought in the 

scored to go up 6-4, with 2:57 left. 
Harper had this to say about the 

play. 
"The fact of the matter is that 

we had oj 6 on 5 and we did every-
thing perfectly, except that we 
threw the ball out: he said. 
·Otherwise, that would have tied 
the game and the crowd would 
have gone ballistic." 

The game could have 'gone 
either way. 

"Instead we throw the ball out. 
they come down and score and 
that's a two-point turnaround and 
we're kind of out of it; Harper 
said. 

Even thouih UCSD lost the 

last qualifying time with a 
21 :47 ,0. 

"The women are making some 
adaptations after a particular style 
of training: Van Arsdale said. "We 
saw much better attention to 
technical aspects of racing. It's not 
always who runs fastest, but who 
puts together a better strategy." 

Other local women finishers 
were Point Lorna Nazarene in 
fourth and SDSU in eighth. 

Next up for UCSD is the NCAA 
Preview Meet at Chino this 
Saturday at 8:30 a.m. This will give 
the Tritons a good idea of where 
they stand among other schools of 
their stature. It is also, a long race, 
with the men required to travel 
10,000 meters and the women 
6,000 meters. 

"It's an unusual year for us; 
Van Arsdale said. "Not only is it 
Ithe NCAA Preview Meetl out 
west, it's at a course we've run 
before. The previews give you a 
chance to see who is coming 
down." 

game, it should be plenty happy 
with its performance. 

USC is a Division I powerhouse 
in every sport and offers scholar-
ships. Despite the fact that water 
polo is an open conference, mean-
ing all teams play one another, it 
still makes a huge difference -
games with scholarship teams play-
ing nonscholarship ,teams usually 
favor the former. 

Seven of the players on the USC 
squad are from Europe. 

Against competition like that , 
UCSD has every right to be 
proud of the way it performed. 
Harper is certainly satisfied with 
his players.

Women's VolleybaIl Comes flome After 1-1 Road Trip 
On Div. II trip Tritons pick up a big 3-1 win at Cal State University 
Stanislaus, fall to Cal State Bakersfield 1-3 after grabbing an early lead 
By aeon BURROUGIII 
Staff Writer 

UCSD came out with arms 
swinging Saturday night, an.d 
most of its blows found their 
mark as the team bludgeoned 
California State University 
Stanislaus 3-1 in Division II vol-
leyball action. 

The match, held at the 
Stanislaus Warrior Arena, saw 

'/ heavy-hitting performances from 
.many of the Tritons' key perform-
e'rs. 

Some of the Triton standouts 
were Laura Santerre, whose 15 kills 
led the squad; Leslie Punelli, who 
chipped in 13; and Jennie Wilson, 
who knocked down a not-too-
shabby total of 10 for the victorious 
blue and gold. 

UCSD established its presence 
early in the match, winning the first 
two games handily by scores of 15-
7 and 15-4, and went into the third 
looking for the sweep. 

Looking to make a quick night 
of. things, the Tritons stumbled. 
The Warriors regrouped and edged 
out the visitors in extra points, 17-
15. 

That was the only taste of victo-
ry the Warriors would have that 
night, as the Tritons fired back in 
the founh game. It also went into 
extra points, but the ending was a 
little different. This time, it was 
UCSD that emerged with the 17-
15 tally to take the game and the 
match. 

UCSD performed strongly in 
this match as many facets of the 
team meshed smoothly, which is 
nO'doubt a result of the diligent 
Triton practice regimen. 

As a collective, the team had a 
superb match. It notched 66 kills, 
with an average attack percentage 
of .211, while picking up five 
blocks . 

With the victory, the Tritons 

UCSD performed

continued their great season to 
date. The team sailed to an 11 -2 
overall record, with five victories 
and one loss in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
division play, while Stanislaus fell 
to 1-5 in the division . 

The Tritons are picking up 
steam at just the right time, as 

many important divisional show-
·downs are fast approaching. 

Crucial matches against Chico 
State, UC Davis and Sonoma State 
will all have an impact on what 
direction the Triton season will be 
heading. 

In earlier action this weekend, 
UCSD fell to Cal State Bakersfield 
3-1 on Friday night. 

The Tritons jumped out early 
to a 1-0 lead after taking the first 
set 15-9 and looked to be in con-
trol. 

Bakersfield rebounded, 
though, and won the next three 
sets, all by the close score of 15-
10. 

Santerre led the way for UCSD 
against Bakersfield with 17 kills in 
the losing effort. 

This Wednesday the teall) will 
face Grand Canyon University in 
another very important CCAA 
match at RIMAC Arena. Game 
time is 7 p.m., so start drinking 
around 2 p.m., purchase the face 
paint and floppy "We're Number 
One" hand at 6 p.m ., get all 
decked out in your finest blue and

Even NBC 
Can't Ruin 
the Olympics 

ROBERT FULTON 

T he greatest event in sports is currently taking place in Australia . Yes, the 
Olympics. 

The Summer Olympics are 
bigger than any other sporting 
event in the world. The World 
Series and Super Bowl are huge, 
but they come every year. Plus, 
even though they are broadcast 
everywhere, they are more or less 
strictly American . Tennis and golf 
are international events but are 
not popular enough to create a 
stir. Hockey, basketball and all 
those other sports are just blips 
on the SpOrts radar. Even soccer's 
World Cup, in which countries go 
crazy about every four years, can't 
match the Olympics. 

The summer games are unique 
in themselves. 

Unfortunately for us, good ai' 
NBC is the angle that brings us 
such excellent coverage. 

HA! 
Before I rant about NBC, 

though, let me make it clear that 
Bob Costas is one of the greatest 
announcers in sports. I would 
watch grass growing if he was 
doing the commentary. 

The first problem with NBC is 
not really its fault. It's the fact that 
Australia is 18 hours ahead of us, 
meaning everything that happens is 
happening tomorrow. And when 
tomorrow comes, it has al ready 
happened yesterday. Or something 
like that. 

All I know is that I flip open 
the morning paper and I see the 
results. Then I watch the news, 
and it shows the results. Then, 
that evening I watch the event, 
already knowing the outcome. 
Whoopee! 

BC does not really try to help 
the cause. Yes, the big events are 
on at odd hours for U.S. viewers. 
What does BC do? It shows the 
same events at odd hours the next 
day. 

The other night it showed the 
men's and women's 1 DO-meter 
dash. That is one of the premiere 
events at the Olympics, yet it was 
on around midnight. I don't under-
stand. 

Another thing is that NBC 
doesn't show the entire event. It is 
all on tape. Watching a basketball 
game the other evening, NBC went 
to a commercial after about five 
minutes of play. When we 
returned, 10 more minutes of 
game time disappeared. What hap-
pened during that time? Nothing 
important, I guess, as dictated by 
NBC. 

Also, I can't stand how NBC 
makes a special story out of every 
single athlete. 

"Jim was a garbage man in New 
York: the voice-over says. "He 
overcame the inner turmoil of car-
rying trash bags to become the 
greatest swimmer ever!" 

Seriously, I was watching a story 
about an equestrian couple. The 
narrator went on about how the 
woman can cook well and the guy 
can make good popcorn. Who

PORTS 
I Water Polo Splits A' Pair 

Tritons make quick work of Loyola Marymount narrowly fall to No. 1 USC 
By TAIT MIW R 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team coasted to a win at home 
last Friday night, beating Loyola 
Marymount University by a score 
of 12-7. 

The Tritons exploded out of 
the blocks, scoring three goals in 
the first quarter while holding the 
Lions of Loyola Marymount 
scoreless. 

With a boisterous, frenzied 
crowd of 825 people behind it, 
the UCSD team did not let up, 
scoring three more goals in the 
second quarter to go up 6-1 . 

LMU looked intimidated by 
the UCSD crowd. 

Distributed among the fans 
were what can only be described 

. as Triton wands. Long and yel-
low, the crowd used them to 
their full effect, cheering and 
beating them to the tunes of the 
pep band and the chants of 
"Tritons, Tritons· and "UCSD, 

· UCSD." 
In the third quarter, the Lions 

mounted a mini-comeback, but 
only in the respect that they 
were not outscored by the 
Tritons. 

Both teams managed four 
goals for the third quarter. 

The final quarter was more of 
the same, as UCSD and LMU 
each posted two goals. 

During the last two quarters, 
it seemed as if the Tritons were 
just keeping up with the Joneses. 
Each time LMU scored a goal, 
the Tritons would come a-
knocking with a goal of their 
own. 

"Any time when you are in a 
scenario where you're playing a 

conference team like LMU that 
you kind of own, they have never 
beaten us, well we just lost some 
intensity," said Head Coach 
Denny Harper. "I was trying to 
rotate some people in, get them 
some minutes: 

Standouts in the game were 
Jason Boettner and Vladimir 
Djapic, each with three goals. 
Andrew Mesic and Jonathan 
Samuels threw in two goals 
apiece, and Kenny Woodruff 
posted a goal to round out the 
scoring for the Tritons. 

LMU was led by Tamas Szego 
and Kevin Witt, who scored two 
points apiece. 

The second game of the week-
end was played on Sunday after-
noon at Canyonview Pool. It pit-

.ted top-ranked USC against the 
Tritons. 

The game was a doozy and 
was not decided until the final 
few minutes of play. When the 
dust settled, the Trojans emerged 
with a narrow 7-5 victory. 

In this hard-fought battle USC 
drew first blood with a goal 3:10 
into the first quarter. UCSD 
clawed its way into the lead with 
two goals by Matthew Ellis: one 
in the first quarter and one in the 
second. 

The first half ended with 
UCSD up 2-1. Part of the reason 
for the Trojans' first-half lead and 
overall excellent performance was 
their great defense. Whenever 
USC had a man advantage, 
UCSD was able to put the defen-
sive clamps on. 

"We played great 5-6 defenst': 
Harper said. "They only went 1 
for 5 against us."

Water Polo's Jason Boettner Having Stellar Year 
All-American swimmer and team captain is making a splash by helping the Tritons to an 8-3 start 
ByTAlT MIW R 
Staff Writer 

Jason Boettner has been a spec-
tacular swimmer and water polo 
player par excellence for the 
Tritons. In his fifth year at UCSD, 
Boettner is as strong as ever. 

Although his swimming eligi-
bility is now used up, after four 
superlative years during which he 
was an All-American, Boettner is 
still in the pool for the Triton 
water polo team. 

Last year Boettner played 115 
quarters, a tie for second on the 
team, and scored 27 goals while 
dishing out 21 assists. 

This season Boettner . has 
picked up right where he left off 
and has helped lead the Tritons to 
an 8-3 start. 

Being a captain this year, 
Boettner's leadership role has 
increased. The position brings 
with it added responsibilities. 
Players look to captains for advice 
and leadership in and out of the 
pool. 

Boettner bears this burden 
well. He forms an integral link on

the season in eighth place. 

A week ago, this very closely 
knit team beat UC Berkeley, 
which at that time was ranked 
No. 1 in the nation . It was the 
first time UCSD had beaten Cal 
in 21 previous tries. Boettner

Boettner started swimming 

year-round when he was 8 years 
old. 

"I guess my mom kind of 
signed me up for lessons and then 
it just went from there: said

"There is a lot more bonding in water polo. The 
guys have to be in .rync with one another to succeed." 

"It felt really great to beat Cal," 
Boettner said. "It has been a let-
down before, because we have 
been so close to beating them so 
many times. This time we really 
stepped up, and all our hard work 
paid off. It just brought the team 
together.· 

Individually, Boettner's goals 
for the season coincide with what

concentrate on swimming. 

Being an All-American swjm-

what would happen if he swam 
year-round. 

"I just wanted to see if I could 
go faster," Boettner said. "I am 
happy I did it. Now there are no 
'what ifs:"

ly. Many schools, whether it be the 
because of coach conflicts or play-
er conflicts, make 5tudents choose 
one or the other. 

Because of the Triton policy, 
Boettner was able to experience 
two sports that, are both played in 
a pool but are inherently different 
in the approaches athletes must 
take to train for them. 

"Swimming is an individual 
sport: Boettner said. "You are 
competing on the team, and for 
the team to win, but it is just you 
in the pool in your event: 

Friendship is also important to 
success. . 

"There is a lot more bonding in 
water polo,· Boettner said. "The 
guys have to be in sync with one 
another to succeed." 

Boettner's dedication to his 
sports has caused him to be an 
almost year-around UCSD stu-
dent. For the past four years, with 
the exception of his junior year 
when he swam year round, he has
