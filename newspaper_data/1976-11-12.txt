The date for the referendum to 
choose UCSD's official student 
government-originally planned 
for late fall or early winter 
quarter-has tentatively been ' set 
for the seventh week of winter 
quarter. 

The UCSD Elections Board is 
still in the process of deliberating 
over such items as the open 
referendum hearings, a voters' 
pamphiet,and the actual balloting 
and financing of the referendum. A 
cost analysis is currently being 
prepared. 

The content of the ballot will deal 
with governmental models and 
comprehensive questions. Among 
the models that will appear on the 
ballot are three that were designed 
by the UCSD Task Force on 
Student Governance last sununer. 
The guidelines for placing ad-
ditional models on · the ballot 
require 250 signatures on a 
petition, a short, one-page 
statement on the model's struc-
ture, purpose and products, and a 
major statement on the model. 

Questions on the Balloi 
Comprehensive questions must 

have 250 signatures on a petition, a 
short, one-page statement of the 
issue, the action to be mandated 
and mechanisms for im-
plementation, and a research 
paper which documents a short 
paper. The name, address and 
telephone number of a person who 
the Elections Board can contact 
with any questions that might arise 
in regard to the proposal must also 
be included. 

The guidelines also require that 
petitions accompanying ballot 

. proposals adhere to the following 
format: name, ID number, and 
signature. Petitions must be in ink 
and have the name of the cir-
culator and the dates of circulation 
on each page. 

All ballot proposals must be 
turned in to Sandy Sterling at the 
Student Organizations Office tm 
the second floor of the Student 
Center. Proposals will be accepted 
through Dec. 2 at • pm. 

Elections Board meetings are 
open to all students. The next 
meeting will be held Monday, in 
the student organizations con-
ference room. 

A marked jmnp baa occurred in 
the amount of students continuing 
at UCSD, reault1ng in an actual fall 
enrollment ol8606 undersraduates. 

According to one UCSD senior 
planning analyst, students are just 
not leaving as fast as estimates 
predicted. The result is that UCSD 
has 290 more students than the T175 
predicted in this year's budget. 

According to analyst Tom 
Robinson, the reason for the jmnp 
is not certain, but a few theories 
exist. One is that the rate of 
students staying in school is 
connected with · the economy. The 
higher the unemployment rate, the 
longer students choose to remain in 
school. 

Another ~eory is that Muir and 
Revelle Colleges have been coming 
down in enrollment, even though 
Third and Fourth colleges have 
continued to grow. This allows for 
more intimacy and less tension, 
according to Robinson, because 
additional help and counseling are 
available for students. With a more 
positive attitude, students tend to 
stay longer. 

UCSD will have to wait until next 
year to see whether this is a 
temporary fluctuation or a trend, 
said Robinson. If it is a trend, 
further steps will have to be taken 
to discover its cause.

Erratum 
In our article Wednesday 

about poet Amiri Baraka's 
appearances at UCSD, we said 
that Baraka will lecture tonight 
at 7: 30 in the Third College 
Lecture Hall 104. This is not 
true. Baraka is scheduled to 
lecture on black revolutionary 
art Saturday night at 7:30 in 
TLHI04. 

Tonight Baraka will instead 
be giving a reading at 7:30 at 
the educational Cultural Center, 
at 4343 Oceanview Blvd. The 
rest of the information in the 
article is correct.

Pal· I 

Ecltor 
Group Formed 

There Is an excitin.iJ~mpus organization being formed at UCSD and I 
want to let you know bout It. For the time beq, it's being called the 
STUDENT PERFOR' CE COOP. 

The COOP Is a brUn child of two highly enthusiastic artists, namely 
Larry SwenDove and Leo DeJohn. 

The COOP will address itself to the needs of undergraduates (but not 
exclusively) wbo want to do more In the way of performance than they 
might be able to do through the auspices of the theatre, music, visual 
arts conununicaUons departments, etc. In a very beneficial way, the 
coOP will be a much needed extension of the work already going 011 here 
alUCSD. 

As conceived by Swerdlove and DeJohn, the STUDENT PER· 
FORMANCE CX>OP will serve the student comnumity as a production 
organization. If. say. Jody or Joe Student wantto put on a play they wrote 
for tit. 113, well, they take their play and a proposal for the production to 
the COOP board for consideration. The CX>OP board then helps them by 
scheduling space, aUocaUng funds, and organizing others to "'.orit on the 
production. Jody or Joe then go ahead with their play, and voila! We all 
get to see a new play several weeks down the road. 

Everyone benefits-Jody or Joe because their play gets ~ced, 
student perfonners because they bave one more show under. t~U' ~lts, 
the drama and lit deparbnents because students are practicmg things 
they learned in classes, and the corrununity in general because of the 
experience of seeing a new play. . 

The COOP is just now organizing. The first meetinl OCcurred. last 
Friday. The next meeting-and this is the one that eve~one ~ho IS in-
terested should attend-will be today 1%:. NOOII. The meeting WiU be held

Students with identity crises are often In-

becoming sPlattered against the waUs of f"ility. To 
answer this, the Student Cooperative Union (SCU) 
was founded. IronicaUy, its first years were ac·

Research vs. Teaching Time: 
UCSD Faculty Defended 

Don Strebel's letter of November 
S contains two gross exaggerations 
which I would like to correct for the 
sake of general good un-
derstanding of what actually <goes 
on at UCSD. I quote Mr. Strebel: 
" ... the current faculty is hired for 
its grant getting (and spending) 
ability, and is cprnml.Ued to 
research. Only grudgingly will 
they sacrifice a few hours a week 
to teach even one cOll1'!e per 
quarter. " 

and one-half give much more time, 
30-40 hours per week, to their in-
structional responsibilities while 
hoping to do a little research at 
night or on weekend'!.

Except for Jhe few who are lucky 
enough to be conducting ex·

writing in the very same area as 
their undergraduate teaching, 
most faculty members do the 
greater part of their research

when on leave.

With regard to the second sen-
tence, I trust that the whole UCSD 
community IUIderstands that the 
faculty of any first rate university 
is committed simultaneously to 
teaching and research. To some 
extent the two interests are 
complementary, and to some 
extent they compete for the in-
dividual's time. In the general 
campus faculty of over four 
hundred members there are 
probably several dozen for whom 
the balance falls too heavily on <----=~ 
research. For the overwhelming 
majority I would estimate that 
about one-half can make a fruitful 
adjustment in which reseal:ch and 
teaching complement each other,

BOUILLABAISSE 
sara j. lowen 

The combination of seeing Jimmy Carter win the presidency and 
"Gone with the Wind" In the same week is too strong to keep me from 
thinking about tbe South, reaUty versus image. 

"Gone with the Wind" has to be the most powerful mytp ever created 
about the South. Moonlight and Magnolia. Mint juleps served outside 
white porticoed mansions. Southern ladies in frothy white dresses, with 
parasols to protect their fair complexions from the sun. Southern gen-
tlemen, raising gaUantry and chivalry to heights not seen since medieval 
times. 

But "Gone with the Wind" is only one image of southerners that 
HollywoQd hal! given to that district. Southern character,s are always 
larger than life. Colonel Sanders, Gom~r Pyle, the Hatf~el~ and the 
McCoys, Miz Ruby, Loretta Lynn. No region has been the VJ~un of more 
stereotypes, many of them unflattering. If Southerners aren t portr~yed 
as living in a feudal plantation SOCiety, they are made to look stupid or 
degenerate. ' 

There was the Southern redneck sheriff, palUlchy, stupid and a 
generally mean son4-a·bitch. He enforced his own law, with the help of 
his shotgun·anned "boys." "We're gonna Nn you out oftown boy, ... " 

Then there are the 'Southern hillbillys, generaUy portrayed as 
lackadaisical and stupid, suffering from hookworm and in-breeding. Any 
energy they do have Is channeled into feuds with the~ enemies. 

And, finally, the image of the Southerner as a racISt. It was e~y in the 
sixties to believe that Southerners were racists and all racISts were 
Southerners. 

But this image is changing, partly because of the South's prosperitr, 
partly because of the Carter presidency. It's not that Carter ~Ill 
singularly dispel all the myths about Southerners. But because Carter IS a 
Southerner, the media is taking a look at the New South, and people are 
discovering that it's not really like its HoUywOO<l image. 

Anyway, people are going to be hearing a lot more Southern accents on 
television in the next four years. As Jimmy Carter says," It's time to put 
someone in the White House who doesn't have an accent."

Coop. They are organic In the sense 
they share the same viewpoint, but 
they never get together to take an 
official stance on scmetbing.· 

"A caucus is to me a group of 
people orga.niZed into a formal 
faction to express .. coUective 
viewpoint. They have identified 
themselves as an organization, and 
they advocate that point. There is 
nothing wrong with this (a~ 
vocating a viewpoint) and this is 
what the Marxist Caucus Is doing 
in the Coop," he said. 

That there Is riotlilng inheri'ntly 
wrong with factions was stressed

religions. 

One of the Baha' i teachings that 
relates to the social conditions of 
our society is the belief In the 
equality of men and women. They 
view humanity as a bird, with 
women as one wing and men as the 
other. Unless each wing develops 
to its fu U potential, the bird will not 
be able to fly. Functioning in its 
most ideal form, this bird would 
bring forth a society of such ex· 
cellence that it cannot be 
imagined. 

The Baha'is bave their own 
calendar. The year is composed of 
19 months with 19' days to each' 
month. Four Intercalary days are 
set aside for the giving of gifts and 
charitable acts. Several holy days 
are celebrated during the oourse of 
the year, including the birthday of 
Baha'II' llah, which is today.

Be.t Albuma 

1. Station to StaUoo-Oavid Bowie 
(RCA) Despite his own insistence 
that he's " rocked his roll," David 
Bowie has once again reached the 
pinnacle of rock music with this 
innovative, superbly crafted LP. 

Station to Station marks a 
comeback of sorts to Bowie after 
the critical panning of his dlsc()-
soul Young Americans LP. 
Perhaps he realized this himself, 
as the ominous opening chords to 
the title track herald " the return of 
the thin white duke. " 

The variety of the cuts is indeed, 
excellent, and prevents the albwn 
from getting bogged down. From 
rockers like "Station to Station" to 
" Stay" to the disco-oriented 
"Golden Years" and " 'I'VC IS" to 
the romantic ballads " Wild is the 
Wind" and "Word on a Wing," 
Bowie succeeds with seeming ease. 
The man(?) just gets better and 
better as time goes by. And just 
listen to that voice. (TM) 

2. Dreamboat Annie-Heart 
(Mushroom) I didn't think it was 
possible for a new band to create 
such an excellent LP. But that just 
shows how wrong I can be. 

Dreamboat Annie is a success on 
all COWlts. The material by Ann 
and Nancy Wilson is absolll.tely 
top-notch, including the hit singles 

UCSD Theater " Magic Man" and " Crazy On You." But unlike many new bands, 
Opens With 
Chekhov Play 

'Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry 
Orchard," first performed in 
Moscow in 1904 less than six 
months before the playwright'~ 
death, will be performed tliTh 
weekend in the UCSD Theatre as 
the opening of the UCSD Theatre's 
1976-77 season. Perfonnances of 
"The Cherry Orchard" cor.tinue 
Nov. 16-21. Showtime is at 8 pm. 

The cast is composed of un-
dergraduate and graduate 
students and one drama depart-
ment faculty member, associate 
professor of voice Mary Corrigan, 
who portrays Ranevskaya. Susan 
Lewis is Ana; John Wesley 
Houston, Jr : Yepihodov; David 
Jensen : Lopakhin ; and Gerry 
Edwards as Gayev. Costwne 
design is by Deborah Dryden, 
scenic design is by Dan Dryden 
and the lighting design is - by 
Amarante Lucero. 

Heart did not settle for a "com-
mercial" oriented albwn with one 
or two hit singles. Dreamboat 
ADnle succeeds because of the 
musical theme within it ; a totally 
satisfying albwn from opening to 
closing. The individual per-
fonnances, paced by Ann Wilson 
on lead vocals, Nancy Wilson on 
acoustic guitar and Roger Fisher 
on lead guitar, appear to be 
flawless . It will be interesting to 
see if their next LP can improve 
upon this one. It will not be easy. 
TM. 

3. All ThIngs In Tlme·Lou Rawls 
(Philadelphia International) With 
this album, Lou Rawls has made a 
startling " comeback" into the 
forefront of the music scene. " AU 
Things In Time" transcends all 
barriers to provide an LP with a 
seemingly universal market. 

All Things In Time features 
some fine upbeat material 
("You're The One" "Groovy 
People" "From Now On" ) as well 
as a selection of ballads ("Time" 
" Need You Forever" " Pure 
Imagination") and a delightful 
light disco composition (the hit

Best Albums 
1. Red Card-Streetwalkers 
(Mercury ) This comprises some of 
the best and least pretentious hard 
rock of the year. The songs are 
hard nosed, the arrangements 
intelligently constructed, the lyrics 

display street level menace better 
than anyone since The Stones, and 
Roger Chapman's vocals grate like 
a chainsaw buzz. Great stuff for 
the insatiable heavy metal addict. 
(TB.) 

2. The RomanUc Warrior-Return 
to Forever (Columbia) Though the 
notion of jazz rack "fusion music" 
has run its course of innovation, 
the latest (and last) RTF albwn 
pumps needed energy and c0m-
positional imagination for an In-
vigorating outing. Chick Corea's 

Heart: 
Albums 

Best Shots 
keyboard work maintains an al>-
stracted dazzle, Al DiMeola con-
tinues to blaze inspiredly in the 
McLaughlin guitar bag, and the 
rhythm section of bassist Stanley 
Clarke and drummer Lenny Clarke 
continue to defy description. 
Romantic Warrior is the quin-
tessential jazz rock product, 
elevated above the rest. (TB. ) 

3. Wlred-JeH Beck (Columbia) 
Without doubt, the guitar'albwn of 
the year. Hard rocker Beck is 
biting, applying his eccentric fret 
work against a funk-jazz backdrop. 
His duets with keyboardist Jan 

Hammer combine power, grace, 
and virtuosity in a breath-taking 
per formance. Especially out-
standing is " Blue Wind", which is 
the best jazz rock rave up since 
Mahavishnu Orchestra's "Vital 
Transformation" . TB.

The advertisements referred to "a world gone mad." Now I've heard of 
truth in advertising, but this was positively ridiculous, because anyone 
who enjoys Black Sabbath would have to be mad. 

Their concert last week at the Sports Arena had to be the worst, most 
annoying show seen in this area since Slade bothered to show up last 
spring. And 'goddamit, I tried my very best to be objective , but my 01>-
jectivity was blown away with the very first chords. 

Now let's get something straight. I've listened to Sabotage, Sabbath 
Bloody Sabbath, and Technical Ecstasy, and was actually able to 
stomach it all. The single " Iron Man" has to be one of the most primitive 
cuts ever released by the record industry, and I thought it was rather 
catchy. But that was still not nearly enough to prepare me for what I was 
to see at the Sports Arena. 

Bob Seger 

I had a premonition of what the concert might be like when I saw 
countless numbers of individuals vomiting in the Sports Arena parking 
lot. I was to find out that the number of sickies would increase tenfold 
once I stepped into the Arena itself. And by the time I left the show I felt 
like joining them. ' 

TJ.le problem with ~Iack Sabbat~ lies beyond their basic lack of talent . 
BeSides the thunderm~, very baSIC guitar playing, the most disturbing 
element of BS IS vocalist Ozzy Osb~rne. Not only is his voice extremely 
annoYlOg,. but hiS m?v.eme~ts and his tirades to the audience wotild lead 
one to beheve that hiS mtelltgence level lies somewhere between idiot and 
moron. 

It was actually tragic that a great rock 'n roller like Bob Seger would 
have to open the show for the likes of Black Sabbath. The man from 
Detroit really knocked 'em dead, and was called back for encore after 
encore. Maybe, just maybe, the audience knew its evening might be 
ruined after his Silver Bullet Band left. 

This is a big year for Seger, who is finally becoming a popular a t-
traction na~ion-wide after years of success in the mid-west. He performed 
much of the material from his big-selling Uve Bullet LP, including 
"Hamblin' Gamblin' Man," "Beautiful Loser," "Nutbush City Limits" 
and " Katmandu." 

His band, paced by Drew Abbott on lead guitar, Alto Reed on 
saxophone, Robyn Robbins on keyboards, Chris Campbell on bass and 
Charlie Allen Martin on drums, was indeed excellent. There is no 
question that Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band show their true colors 
in concert. I mean that to be a flattering corrunent, despite the fact that 
Black Sabbath also shows its true colors in concert. 

Bob Seger is a great, sure·fire rock 'n roller, an artist with power and 
dynamism as ~ell as a hell of a lot of talent. Why they put him on the bill 
with Black Sabbath I'll never know. 

Capitol Records has announced the pending release of three albums, 
the Beach Boys Uve In London, The Best of George Harrison and The 
Best From Lou Rawls. 

The Beach Boys albwn was recorded in 1969. Released here for the first 
time, it contains a dozen songs including such hits as "Good Vibrations," 
"Barbara Ann," "God Only Knows," "Do It Again," " California Girls," 
"Sloop Jolm B" and "Darlin' " . 

The Best of George Harrison is the first collection bringing together the 
top material from the ex-Beatie. The 13 songs are divided so that the first 
side covers his Beatie days ("Something," " Here Comes The Sun" and 
"While My Guitar Gently Weeps" among others) and the second side 
encompas~s his solo career ("My Sweet Lord," "Give Me Love" and 
"You" are included). ' 

The Best From Lou Rawls is a tw()-record set outlining his career_ The 
twenty tunes include " Dead End Street," "Love Is a Hurttn' Thing" and 
"Your Good Thing."

Soccer Team 
Defeated In 
f?layoffs 

After "~ the hell" out of 
westmont College for ooe half of 
action, the UCSD soccer team was 
defeated by injuries and the 
hometeam 3-1, Wednesday, in the 
opening round of the NAIA District 
III playoffs. 

The loss brought an end to the 
Tritons' soccer season. 

With goalie Hans Landell 
making several good saves and his 
reanunates working hard and 
playing smart, controlled soccer, 
uam led after the first half 1~. 

Jairo Marin chipped a short pass 
to the Tritons' leading scorer, 
Alfonso Gonzales, who headed the 
ball into the nets for UCSD's only 
goal of the contest. 

In the second half the Tritons 
suffered a rash of injuries that 
reQuced nearly half their players 
into a group of walking wounded 
Westmont, on the other hand, had 
enough players to field several 
teams and finally wore down the 
visitors. 

When Allen Cox, the first Triton 
to get hurt, left the game with a 
pulled muscle, Westmont sent in 
five fresh players. · 

Besides Cox, UCSD players 
perfonning below physical par by 
the end of the game were Russ 
Crane (pulled muscle), Carlos 
Ponte (under doctor's orders to 
rest), Fernando Padilla (muscle 
pull and cramp) and Mark Self 
(cramp, bad knee and hernia) . 
Defensive standout Al Turkin 
missed the contest because of an 
upcoming exam. 

" Despite all the injuries, we still 
played even with them," said 
UCSD coach IlarrRothmuller after 
the game. "We scared the hell out 
of them for awhile. The players 
had this self-pride thing going 
when it looked like the injuries 
would allow Westmont to walk 
away with the game. We did not let 
them." 

"I guess," added Rothmuller, 
" the line is something like, 'we 
lost, but. we were not beaten."

At 7:00 last Saturday, 1 wmied in the gymnuium parldng lot for my 
ride to the annual University ~ California, Irvtne Rugby tournament. 
The sun was shining and already warm. It .... a fine 1DOI'IlIng. 

I leaned on my car and listened to the players OIl the ucm rugby team 
talk. They spoke of the nJglj before. Tbere .... much lauglhr. One 
player wore a shirt that had the words "Give Blood, Play Rugby" printed 
on it. 

My ride arrived. The driver was Kevin SapiD, a rqby player 'or'many 
years, now, 01\ the UCSD team. With him .... a blond, curly-bldred beast 
named Stuart Altemus, once a member of the UCSD team,..IJut DOW 
playing for the Del Mar Rugby Club. Stuart got out ~ the ~ to go look for 
a jockstrap. I took lU place In the front seal When be retumed and 
climbed into the back be called me a fucker. 

We arrived at the tournament. The UCSD team gathered under a tree 
alongside one of the playing fields. They put'on spiked shoes. There was 
more talk. Some talked about the free beer being given out. Some talked 
of possible injuries. Some talked about rugby. They all talked about the 
young, healthy woman in the white hothot pants and undersized tubHop 
that walked by. It wasa team preparing to play rugby. 

The action on the fields began. I did not watch the games. I watched 
athletes performing. I watched them run with the ball. I watched them 
kick the ball . I watched them strike and batter one another. I watched 
their exertion, their pain, their sweat, their spirit, their feeling and the.ir 
style. I watched men playing rugby. I watched them because I had never 
before seen a rugby game and I had no idea what the hell was going on. It 
was good. 

I sat in the stands. I drank a beer. I took off my shirt to get a suntan, A 
woman sitting next to me took off her sweater to brown her shoulders. I 
offered her some beer. She already had some. 

We were rugby fans. 
UCSD played UC Irvine and won. Captain Dan Dworsky scored the try. 

Sapin kicked the extra point. The defense was tight. I saw Stuart. He was 
too. 

The woman in the hotbots reappeared She threw a football back and 
forth with aman. She threw it well. ' 

"She throws like a guy," a rugby player said. 
He was wrong. She thre.like a woman. 
The tournament continued. The sun and competition were intense. As 

the long day wore, many players were injured. They did not complain. 
They took pain with the game. They took beer with the pain. They were 
rugby players. 

UCSD won another contest. Jeff Domein ran long and hard for two 
scores. He waS good 

I left the stands. As I walked towards the other field a pretty young girl 
asked me if I played rugby. Suddenly it all became clear to me. Rugby! 
OhRugby! Rugby! Rugby! Rugby! So this is whStit is all about! 

"Yes,"1 said to her,lying. 
She smiled .•• Are you in this tournament?" 
"Yes." 
"00 you play for UCLA?" 
" Yes." 
"00 you start?" 
"Yes." Yes, yes,Yes, yes. 
" Well I think you and your Bruins are terrible for coming here and 

beating up on these small schools that are out here for fun just to feed 
your big fat egos." 

She turned and walked away. 
1 watched UCLA defeat UCSD by a score of 22-0. It was a rugby match 

played by rubgy players. 
It was good.
