The earthquake that hit the 
Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince 
on Jan. 12 — claiming an estimated 
200,000 lives, according to the Pan 
American Health Organization — 
also took the life 
of 24-year-old 
UCSD gradu-
ate and Arizona 
native Daniel 
Ryan Kloos.

Ryan, who 
went by his mid-
dle name, was in 
Haiti visiting his 
sister Erin Kloos, 
age 27. She was 
one of four 
Americans volunteering at Friends of 
the Orphans, a subset of the children’s 
charity Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos.

At the time of his death, Ryan was 
at the Father Wasson Center, a chil-
dren’s hospital where his sister worked. 
When the 7.0 magnitude earthquake 
hit, five of the hospital’s seven sto-
ries collapsed, killing both Ryan and 
another volunteer, Molly Hightower, 
age 22.  

Ryan graduated from Muir 
College in 2008 with a double major 
in Sociology and Biochemistry/ 
General Biology, and had just been 
accepted to two schools of osteopath-
ic medicine, according to close friend 
and classmate Liz Costa.

On Jan. 11, the California State 
Assembly Committee passed a bill 
aimed at allocating more funds to 
higher education with five affirma-
tive votes and two negative votes. Bill 
AB 656, authored by Assemblyman 
Alberto Torrico (D–Fremont), will 
impose an excise tax on oil com-
panies that extract oil and natural 
gas from the state’s land and water 
sources.

If passed by the California State 
Legislature, the bill would create 
the California Higher Education 
Endowment Corporation. The cor-
poration would be run by represen-

tatives from the 
California State 
University system, 
the University of 
California and 
community col-
leges and would 
be responsible 
for allocating the 
money each year.

Earlier this 
month, the bill 
was amended to 
incur a 12.5-per-
cent severance 
tax, as opposed to 

the previously proposed 9.9-percent 
tax. According to an analysis by the 
Assembly Committee on Revenue 
and Taxation, the tax will now be 
expected to raise $1.8 billion in 2010 
and $2 billion in 2011. 

Prior to recent amendments, 
the bill would have sent 60 per-
cent of revenue to the CSU sys-
tem, 30 percent to the UC system 
and just 10 percent to community 
colleges. After the urging of the 
Faculty Association of California 
Community Colleges, however, the 
bill was rewritten and now directs 
50 percent of its revenue to the CSU 
system, 25 percent to the UC sys-
tem and 25 percent to community 
colleges.

“We have allowed oil companies 
in California to extract oil from our 
ground and we have failed to charge

A fter the grand opening of the Sustainability Resource Center last November, members of the Student Sustainability Collective and Campus 
Sustainability administrators have not yet come 
to an agreement over how to share the space.�

According to SSC student director Rishi 
Ghosh, the center was conceived two years ago 
when students approached university adminis-
trators with hopes to begin the project. When 
student activity fees were raised last Spring 
Quarter — providing the SSC with an addi-
tional $2.34 per-student per-quarter for proj-
ects and staff — SSC members were under the 
impression their new efforts would be housed 
by the collaborative space.

Since then, however, university staff and 
student leaders have disagreed on the role of 
students in the center — leaving the SSC with-
out the opportunity to utilize the SRC on a 
consistent basis.

“The spirit of the referendum, the way we 
advertised it, was that the funding was for 
students working right in the new SRC,” A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta said. “That was the con-
text in which we had all these discussions with 

the administration — until it 
totally flipped. It was a bait-and-
switch.”�

According to the SRC’s Web 
site, its original intention was 

to “house UCSD’s sustainability staff and the 
student-funded and -run SSC.”

As no form has yet been signed indicating 
an understanding of the two groups’ control of 
the center, however, only the CSS currently has 
full access the space.

In the months following the student-fee 
referendum, plans for the center were arranged 
verbally between students and staff. University 

UCSD graduate Daniel 
Ryan Kloos was killed 
while volunteering for a 
children’s hospital.

After more than six hours of debate, the A.S. 
Council voted 20-7-1 late Wednesday night to 
place the Loft referendum on the Spring Quarter 
election ballot. If approved by the student body, 
the proposal would raise student fees by $3.82 per 
student per quarter. The money would go toward 
art and music programming at the Loft.

The referendum requires that at least 29 per-
cent of the fees go to financial aid, that at least 80 
percent of all events at the Loft be “pay as you can” 
for UCSD students and that undergraduates rep-
resent at least 60 percent of the venue’s hiring staff. 

During yesterday’s meeting, the council dis-
cussed two models of the referendum — one 
sponsored by A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs and chair of the University 
Centers Advisory Board Jordan Taylor, and one 
sponsored by A.S. President Utsav Gupta. 

The primary difference between the two 
proposals was the intensity of A.S. Council 
oversight. 

Under Gupta’s proposal, the A.S. Council 
would create a student-majority Loft Governance 
Board to regulate the venue’s budget allocation.  
This board would include various members of

Researchers from UCSD have developed a 
“baby robot” to simulate the growth and develop-
ment of a one-year-old child.

Named Diego-San, the robot is used to conduct 
research on the brain development of children. It is 
part of the Machine Perception Laboratory — part 
of UCSD’s division of Calit2 and the Institute for 
Neural Computation at UCSD — whose mission is 
to create a robot that can learn and develop senso-
ry-motor and communicative skills of infants. 

Dr. Javier Movellan, principal investigator and 
founder of MPL, created Diego-San in order to 
study how babies acquire problem-solving skills 
that are, traditionally, difficult to reproduce with 
robots. 

“The idea came from the fact that many prob-
lems in robotics and artificial intelligence have been 
very difficult to solve with classic A.I. approaches,” 
Movellan said. “Yet babies solve, within one year of 
life, the most complicated problems effortlessly.”

Movellan said he created the project to under-
stand the complex brain development of a baby 
when it learns the motor and social skills necessary 
to survive.

The four-foot, 66-pound humanoid robot is 
equipped with a head that houses 20 moving parts 
that make facial expressions without speaking, two 
high-definition cameras for eyes, an audio speaker 
for a mouth and a six-axis accelerometer for ears, to 
detect orientation and movement. 

The robot also has five-fingered hands that can 
hold objects like water bottles. It has sensors that 
detect the pressure points placed on different joints 
in its body, and can stand up from a chair.

The main goal, according to Movellan, is for the 
robot to carry out all these functions independently 
by integrating motor control functions in social 
interactions with only the help of its sensors and 
activators. 

MPL is currently in its second phase of the proj-
ect — which includes developing the control elec-

tronics and software — and is trying to replicate 
the way babies learn motor movements.

Specifically, the researchers want the robot to 
be able to recognize facial expressions, learn and 
recognize the appearance of its caregivers, reach 
objects on its own without human aid and use ges-
tures like pointing, reaching and grasping for items. 

 To do so, researchers are currently working 
on an algorithm that integrates a multidisciplinary 
approach of bringing together the fields of physics, 
electronics and psychology.

 “The robot really is an instrument for research 
and our goal is to push the limits of robot control,” 
Movellan said. We want it to have similar proper-
ties to that of a human being and the level of com-
plexity similar to that of a human being.”

The robot has already been publicized in a 
newsletter published by Kokoro, a company in the 
Sanrio Group that specializes in animated robots 
and automated machinery. It has also been featured 
in several tech blogs, such as www.gizmodo.com, to 
mostly negative responses on the baby’s appearance. 

Of the responses from blogs, Movellan said, 
“One of my students told me about this. I was sur-
prised that this made it through the Internet.”  

He said did not expect the newsletter to reach 
the Internet. But now, he said he sees the feed-
back as an opportunity to improve the robot’s 
design. For example, he plans to change the 
aesthetics of the face by working with Hanson 
Robotics, who collaborated with MPL on the 
Einstein robot.

Movellan responded to some of the blogs, clari-
fying that researchers were still in the initial phase 
of developing the robot’s body (which was con-
structed by Kokoro, along with the head).

After the developmental phase, MPL is planning 
to train the robot.

“It’s been great [because it’s] such a challenging 
project that tests you in so many different ways,” 
Movellan said. “What I expect from the project is a 
better understanding of the nature of human intel-
ligence.”

The research began in September 2008. Diego-

San is part of Project One, funded by the National 
Science Foundation.

As far as a projected date for completion, 
Movellan said that — though the funding will be 
cut off in 2013 — work on Diego-San is likely to 
continue much longer.

“The project is part of an ongoing effort to 
understand the development of intelligence in 
infants from a computational point of view,” 
Movellan said. “The effort is likely to continue for 
as long as I am alive.”

NEWS� THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

Centers designated a space for it in 
Price Center.�

The administration agreed to 
fund renovations to the space while 
students and staff negotiated the 
terms of how the space was to be 
shared between advocates. The 
agreement was to be authenticated 
with the signing of a Memorium of 
Understanding by the SSC and CSS, 
to establish the presence of each 
group in the space.�

According to Ghosh, SSC mem-
bers hoped to have the MOU signed 
prior to the center’s opening last 
November. �

“We were of the opinion all the 
hard work was done,” Ghosh said. 
“We just needed to sign the MOU.”�

However, the SCC has failed to 

come to an agreement with Campus 
Sustainability Coordinator Margaret 
Souder since then; as a conse-
quence, Souder has not allowed stu-
dents to use the space freely.

According to Souder, the two 
groups have been unable to reach a 
final agreement because represen-
tatives from the SSC continue to 
change their stance on the details of 
the MOU.�

“We’ve had several meetings and 
were all in agreement,” Souder said. 
“But then the SSC would have come 
back with new ideas and wouldn’t 
agree anymore.”�

New changes were proposed 
over multiple meetings, according 
to Souder.�

“In the details is where it falls 
through,” Souder said. “We come 

up with an agreement and everyone 
is happy. Then, a few people want 
changes, and we begin discussions 
again and come to a new agreement. 
In the last few meetings, though, an 
agreement hasn’t been reached.”�

Members of the SSC have 
expressed frustration with the dis-
cussions. Ghosh said that Souder 
has recently retracted promises she 
outlined verbally in original discus-
sions of the MOU.�

“It actually was worked out ear-
lier,” Ghosh said. “It’s just that it was 
worked out verbally. We were made 
specific promises. [Souder] had 
consistently told us her supervisors 
were on board. It was not as if we 
just stormed in. We had gone through

Awet Wednesday night and a leaking fourth-floor forum didn’t hinder the A.S. 
Council from finally deciding the fate 
of the Loft Referendum. 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue first addressed 
the council. She discussed planning 
for the next fiscal 
year, and warned 
councilmembers 
that Student 
Affairs programs 
will be cut further 
due to the grow-
ing state deficit.

But Rue’s pre-
sentation wasn’t entirely filled with 
depressing statistics — she spoke of 
UCSD’s coming 50th anniversary 
during the 2010-11 academic year, 
and the festivities and flair surround-
ing the anticipated yearlong celebra-
tion. 

About two of the six total hours 
the council dedicated to the Loft dis-
cussion consisted of debate between 
two different proposals for Loft 
oversight. The council discussed 
President Utsav Gupta’s suggestion 
to create a Loft Governance Board, 
as well as University Center Advisory 
Board Chair Jordan Taylor’s recom-
mendation that the existing commit-
tee continue regulating the Loft. 

The council voted 16-11 in favor 
of Taylor’s proposal over Gupta’s. 
Once the governing body proposal 
was finalized, the council amended 
the referendum line by line.

Once the language of the Loft 
Referendum was passed a few hours 
later, the council took to debate 
over whether or not the referendum 
should appear on the Spring 2010 
ballot.

Strong arguments were heard 
from both sides. 

“The Loft is a part of student life,” 

Taylor said. “We saw 1,500 student 
signatures in support, and if that’s 
not enough to convince you that this 
needs to go to a student vote, then I 
don’t know what is.”

AVP Enterprise Operations Rishi 
Ghosh was a vocal opponent against 
the referendum. 

“When educa-
tion funds have 
gone down dra-
matically, why are 
we entertaining 
the idea of fund-
ing entertain-
ment?” Ghosh 
said. “It’s frivolous 

to what I think is our core function 
as a governing body.”

Muir College Senator Lynne 
Swerhone summed up the arguments 
nicely: “I feel like no one’s going to 
read this proposal,” she said, and the 
room filled with snaps in agreement.

After three more hours of debate 
and a 20-7-1 vote, the council 
decided that the Loft referendum will 
appear on the Spring Quarter 2010 
ballot. A round of applause followed 
— the decision was made just past 
1 a.m.

During question time, Sixth 
College Senator Kevin Nguyen 
and Warren College Senator Alyssa 
Wing appeared before the council, 
armed with a colorful poster that 
read, “Associated Students, will you 
go to Spirit Night with me?” Nguyen 
and Wing, in a continuation of their 
senator project, insisted on A.S. 
Council support at the Jan. 30 bas-
ketball game against Cal State San 
Bernardino.

After a long eight hours, the 
council retired for the night, and 
Marshall Chair Tanvir Dhillon gra-
ciously offered a ride so fellow coun-
cilmembers wouldn’t have to walk 
home in the rain.

4WN\�;IOI�+WUM[�\W�I�+TW[M them an extraction fee, as every 

other state in the country currently 
does,” Torrico said. “AB 656 will 
address that problem directly.” 

According to CEO of the 
California Independent Petroleum 
Association Rock Zierman, one 
common objection to this bill is that 
it would cause an increase in gas 
prices — something Californians 
in today’s economic crisis can ill 
afford.

Torrico, however, said that AB 
656 wouldn’t allow for such a price 
jump.

“The bill specifically prohibits oil 
companies from passing along the 
severance fee to consumers at the 
pump,” Torrico said.

The text of AB 656 states that 
not only are gas companies forbid-
den from “using the tax as a pretext 
to materially raise the price of oil,” 
but also that the State Board of 
Equalization is licensed to investi-

gate any producers that they sus-
pect of doing so. However, Zierman 
doubts the bill’s ability to realisti-
cally restrain gas prices, despite its 
strong wording. 

“[Torrico’s claim] is true and it’s 
not true,” Zierman said. “The only 
companies that [the investigation] 
would affect are the fully integrated 
companies that extract crude oil 
from the ground and take it all the 
way to their gas stations. What this 
bill can’t stop is an increase in gas 
prices. You can’t completely prohibit 
an increase in the price of gas — 
that’s a global market.”

The bill is backed by the 
California Federation of Teachers, 
the Service Employees International 
Union and the UC Student 
Association. 

“I think 656 will provide us with 
an important alternative source 
of revenue to allow education to 
be prioritized in this state,” UCSA 
President Victor Sanchez said. “It’s 

the solution that’s out there, the one 
that’s the most tangible and it’s the 
one that has the most backing and 
is moving forward. We’re waiting to 
see what’s going to happen.” 

While Sanchez is uncertain about 
the fiscal effects that the bill would 
have on oil companies and oil-
dependent industries, he stressed 
the need for additional funding for 
universities and colleges.

“We don’t know what the impli-
cations would be [for consumers], 
but we do know what it would mean 
for higher education in California,” 
Sanchez said.

Having passed out of commit-
tee, the bill must now face both 
houses of the legislature. Since AB 
656 pertains to revenue and budget-
ary issues, it requires a two-thirds 
majority from the state senate and 
assembly.

WILL
YOU

TUNE IN
TO SRTV 

THIS
WEEK?

Flops to John Freshwater, an eighth-grade teacher in 
Ohio, for burning a cross onto two students’ arms in an 

attempt to force his religious beliefs onto them.

Props to President Obama for asking lawmakers to 
approve an additional $1.3 billion education initiative 
intended to spur innovation in schools.

Attendance doesn’t usually count in college. Your biol-ogy professor won’t notice if 
you don’t show up to your 300-person 
lecture, and there’s little consequence 
to ditching a dorm meeting besides 
missing out on a free slice of pizza. 

But when you’re an A.S. coun-
cilmember who earned the student 
body’s vote on enthusiastic promises 
of change and visibility, the very least 
you can do is make an appearance at 
your own weekly meeting. 

Showing up is a minimum 
requirement that — according to 
A.S. Advocate General Parminder 
Sandhu — many A.S. councilmem-
bers have been struggling to meet. 
Four members are one absence away 
from the council’s three-absence 
maximum, and six have surpassed it. 
Sandhu now plans to nominate them 
for impeachment at the A.S. Council 
meeting during Week Four. 

And rightfully so. In a perfect 
world, the councilmembers we elect-
ed last year would gauge their peers’ 
perspectives, then vote accordingly at 
meetings. But if members aren’t even 
showing up for meetings, it’s likely 
they’re not surveying the general pub-
lic. And if they’re not surveying the 
general public, they’re probably not 
doing much else.

True, a handful of councilmem-
bers have still been productive out-

side of weekly meetings. But their 
absence also slows the council’s prog-
ress on collaborative initiatives by 
necessitating repeat information.

We understand that discussing 
referenda language for six hours isn’t 
the most stimulating way to spend a 
Wednesday night, but there’s more to 
being a student representative than 
making posters and designing bear 
paraphernalia. All A.S. councilmem-
bers knew what they were signing up 
for when they ran for election, and if 
they aren’t honoring their commit-
ment, they don’t deserve to buffer 
their resume with some official-
sounding position any longer. 

According to Sandhu, excus-
ing an absence prior to a meet-
ing is as simple as saying “I 
have a class.” You’d think the 
impeachable councilmembers 
would at least care enough to lie 
about why they’re ditching. 

Problem is, the council 
threatens to impeach no-shows 
almost every year, but never 
does. In 2008-09, Campuswide 
Senator Henry David 
Ritcherson missed 
the vast majority of 
meetings, but no one 
noticed. By the time 
his absences finally 
came up in Spring 
Quarter, there was so 

little time left that no one wanted to 
impeach him.

Maybe this year it’ll be differ-
ent, but — despite the fact that A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta’s supports 
Sondhu’s impeachment nomina-
tions — the A.S. General Advocate 
still needs two-thirds of council’s 
approval to move the process along. 
Considering a majority of members 
don’t want to upset their cushy, non-
committal community or endanger 
their own right to ditch out, it’s 
unlikely anyone will be 
voted off the island. 

Furthermore, even the nonvoting 
members — who have accumulated a 
good amount of absences themselves 
— have submitted an amendment 
to the council’s Standing Rules that 
would eliminate their obligation to 
come to meetings altogether.

What can we say that’s not pains-
takingly obvious? Don’t run for office 
if you’re not planning on showing up 
to meetings. Make the impeachment 
of voting councilmembers who’ve 
exceeded the limit a more execu-

tive decision. Maybe then they 
might show enough commit-

ment to lie and say they’re 
having car troubles. It’s 

the least our representa-
tives can do to show one 

of their only obligations 
some scrap of respect.

At the risk of being branded a crazed cat lady, I’ll confess: Anything involving those 
lethargic lumps of fluff I’ve called pets 
all my life is of great fascination to me. 

So when I came across this online 
scandal starring an especially press-
worthy kitty, I was all ears. Turns out 
a couple from Boston thought it’d be 
funny to include their furry “son” on 
a census, identifying the animal as Sal 
Esposito. 

Though the pair explicitly stated 
Sal’s status as a non-Homo sapien 
(read: cat), that minor detail still slid 
under the rug of the Suffolk court-
house, and the feline was summoned 
to jury duty. Then, when the Espositos 
attempted to disqualify the feline, the 
jury commissioner decided the house-
cat still had to show.

Without trying to stereotype, 

I’ll be frank: Anyone who fills out a 
census and includes the names of his 
or her pets is a freak. One can safely 
assume that Mrs. E knew the pet 
police wouldn’t come pounding on 
her door had she not included little 
Sal — but she had to list the smallest 
family member anyway.

As a cat enthusiast who’s owned 
a geriatric, obese Siamese monster 
for 14 years, I nonetheless must dis-
tance myself from the likes of Mrs. E. 
Prematurely aging your cat by naming 
him after an old Italian dude is one 
thing (Sal, please pass the prunes), 
but bringing the troublemaker to the 
courthouse, as if he’d otherwise get 
arrested? Listen, Lady — I know you 
love Sal, but he is not your son. Nor 
does he give a crap about human 
justice.

Admittedly, my family isn’t much 
better. I’ve witnessed human-feline 
interaction evolve from a simple 
pet-and-purr exchange to my mom 
asking my sister if she wouldn’t 
mind sleeping on the couch because 
Spanky was used to taking her bed. 
See, Mom didn’t want the change of 
environs to excite poor Spank into a 
heart attack.

Now our bedrooms are hand-me-
down lounges for the exclusive breed-
ing of fleas. Cool. Thanks, Mom.

Cat lovers everywhere cater to 
their companions like children, but 
kicking your firstborn onto the couch 
for a kitty’s sake? Too much. There’s a 
reason that Garfield and Jon Arbuckle 
could never talk shit on Odie to each 
other: There’s a respected division 
between species.

My mom and Mrs. E have crossed 
the line. And they’re not alone. Take 
a walk in your neighborhood on a 
breezy Sunday, and you can bet your 
bottom dollar that at least one visored 
Betty will be walking a sweater-cozied 
bulldog named Horace, with whom 
she will be having a full-fledged con-
versation.

I can only hope that womankind 
will revert back to the good days, 
when best-friend cats were distanced 
to the appropriate middle ground: 
beloved playthings, but clear-cut 
inferiors (sorry, PETA). But as Mrs. 
E has demonstrated, America is only 
becoming more pet obsessed. Any 
attempt to undo Paris Hilton damage 
on pet relations would be futile.  It’s 
2010, baby, and what Fluffy wants, 
Fluffy gets.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2010. Views expressed herein represent the majority 

vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 

the members of the Guardian staff. 

Despite decades of evidence to the contrary, there’s always something we want to trust in the goobery handshakes of student-life 
administrators, spectacles a-sparkle, promising us the 
world.

Two years ago, the promise was a space for the sole 
purpose of streamlining sustainability efforts on campus: 

a snazzy center where both the Student Sustainability 
Collective and university officials could combine their scat-

tered, homeless initiatives under one roof; a lean, 
green, tree-hugging machine.

The Sustainability Resource Center — now 
located next door to Price Center Theater, in 
what used to be the EDNA info booth — was 
originally a brainchild of the SSC. The organiza-
tion offered to pay for it through student activ-
ity fees, allotted quarterly by the A.S. Council.

That’s when university officials kindly stepped in, offering 
to pay all construction and rent costs, so that A.S. funds — 
which now abound, since student activity fees were inflated last 
year, with a special line for the SSC — could go 100 percent 
toward the projects themselves.

Surely student leaders must have felt, for a moment, that 
they might just be on the same team as the Man, all money and 
power aside — especially for the sake of something so blatantly 
common-good as slowing the gassy death of our dear planet 
Earth.

The center’s Web site is still taglined with its startup mis-
sion: to “house” both university staff and SSC representatives in 
a “collaborative space” to realize “common goals.”

Despite this noble goal, now that construction rubble has 
cleared and recycled-material furniture been pushed into 
its right place, the SSC can hardly call the center a home. 
Simple initiatives like a campuswide bike-rental program and 
electronic-waste bins are having trouble getting off the ground, 
as they have no central place to exist: Campus Sustainability 
Coordinator Maggie Souder won’t allow students to set up any 
additional fixtures inside the SRC.

In fact, according to SSC student director Rishi Ghosh, they 
aren’t even allowed to put anything on the shelves or the walls. 
Students can only use the meeting space by appointment — 
and even those can be overridden by administrative agenda.

They don’t hold keys to the building.
Souder blames the student shutout 

on their own inability to present her 
with an agreeable right-to-use form, 
which would lay out the guidelines 
for their presence in the center. But 
ultimately, it’s up to Souder’s discre-
tion whether students should be able 
come and go in the interim. The space 
“rules” she’s set up are clearly arbitrary 
hurdles, serving to shut the strewn 
backpacks and collegiate commotion 
out of her pristine new office as long 
as possible.

Meanwhile, the student vision of 
a bustling community lounge has lost 
the good fight to UCSD’s token taste 
for anal feng shui. Seems administra-

tors will never stop trying to convince 
us we like Ikea ottomans and white 
space as much as they do. Green, chilly 
and spotless, the SRC looks and feels 
not unlike music/art venue the Loft a 
few chain restaurants down — nice-
looking and new-smelling, but not us. 
Not college. So from here on out, let’s 
at least get our promises in writing.

(Granted, the Loft wasn’t created 
under the same pretense that students 
were going to get some say in its 
goings-on. We weren’t even asked to 
pay — not directly, at least. Although 
now that the Loft is going on the A.S. 
referendum as a potential student 
cost, what do you say we bulldoze 
that UFO lamp and graffiti over the 
olive-puke wall paint?) 

The entire SRC lobby area is dedi-
cated to bragging about the center’s 
uber-progressive building materials 
— vintage wood flooring; translucent 
window panes and Polygal walls to 
maximize daylight (even though the 
ceiling is riddled with light fixtures); 
furniture shaped so sustainably your 
body enters a state of absolute space-
age efficiency. 

It reeks of public relations, not 
progress. And all the while, the SSC 
is sitting on a budget the size of the 
ozone hole. Not to be dramatic, but 
trees are dying. Glaciers are melting. 
Polar-bear cubs are crying. It’s the 
kind of sadness that warrants a clut-
tered bulletin board and the sacrifice 
of personal desk space.

EXPIRES 2/15/10

Dear Editor,
I wish to bring more coverage to 

the clicker technology being used 
in classrooms. You might already be 
familiar with it; however, I did notice 
that only a handful of classes at UCSD 
use this system, so I’ll provide a short 
background from my perspective.

Certain classes require each stu-
dent to buy a wireless clicker device 
that works as a remote control. Each 
student’s clicker communicates with a 
wireless hub that the professor brings 
to class, and this serves as a wireless 
voting system. 

Professor of molecular biology 
Susan Golden uses this system for 
BILD 1 to track students’ participa-
tion, and can thus objectively award 
points toward their final grades. She 
generally asks a multiple-choice ques-
tion and opens up the poll for those 
of us in class to choose an answer. She 
then discusses the right answer and 
has real-time results of the poll to see 
how the entire class is doing in under-
standing the subject matter that she 
just taught. 

This has several advantages — it 
allows students an opportunity to 
think critically during lectures, and it 
allows the professor to gauge students’ 
understanding of the material in real-
time. It also allows the entire class to 
participate without feeling bad about 
selecting an incorrect answer. I think 
it’s fair, useful and I like the system.

However, I would like to bring 
serious attention to two facts: First, 
the clicker device is extremely expen-
sive! In addition to requiring a $180 
textbook for the class, students are 
now required to spend upward of $40 
for a clicker. Secondly, it appears that 
there are three to four different clicker 
devices from different manufacturers 
that are all incompatible with each 
other, and some professors use one 
system and others use the other. 

This is a serious oversight on the 
part of the professors and the univer-
sity to not have one system so that 
students do not incur multiple costs 
for different systems that provide 
the same service. Not to mention, 
students have to carry multiple bulky 
clickers around (although this, in 
principle, is insignificant to the larger 
issue). 

My hope is that students will stand 
up against what seems like a broken 
system which only burdens them with 
higher costs.

Rain got you down? Head over to 
Porter’s Pub at 7 p.m. and laugh your 
ass off to the comedic stylings of the 
Dan Simmons Comedy Club of Higher 
Learning. It’s going to be free, fun 
and freaking hilarious.

HiATUS

T he anthem of vola-tile youth, Kubrick’s adaptation of 
Anthony Burgess’ dark, 
violent novel is equally 
offbeat and haunt-
ing. Set in futuristic 
London, the film cen-
ters on Alex (Malcolm 
McDowell), A psycho-
pathic gang leader who 
settles down for a nice 
glass of milk and some 
Beethoven after rip-
ping open young girls’ 
throats.

When Alex is arrest-
ed for rape and murder, 
he undergoes behavior 
therapy to purge his 
violent tendencies — 
only the therapy itself 
is brutal and sadistic. It 
can be quite a sobering 
surprise if you go in 
unaware, but “Orange” 
remains a horrific 
favorite for its exhila-
rating pace, perversity 
and harsh honesty. So 
if you and the droogs 
can’t make up your ras-
soodocks about what 
do to for the evening, 
head to Kensington 
for the bets kind of 
violence. 

J eff Bridges is the Dude — a bathrobe wearing, White 
Russian-drinking 
bowler who keeps to 
himself. That is, until 
two porn-industry 
gangsters invade his 
home in a case of mis-
taken identity, and soil 
one very important 
rug that really tied his 
living room together. 
Seeking retribution for 
his prized carpet, el 
Duderino locates the 
perpetrator: Lebowski. 
During their meeting, 
Lebowski commissions 
the Dude to rescue his 
kidnapped trophy wife. 
Throw in ultra-feminist 
daughter Maude, a 
Vietnam vet with anger 
issues, a handful of 
nihilists and a very wet 
ferret, and you’ve got 
“The Big Lebowski” — 
it never disappoints. 
The Dude always draws 
a large slippered crowd, 
mostly belligerent, so 
grab a Russian, pour it 
in a discrete thermos 
and get there early.

W ith the tagline “Man is the warmest place to 
hide,” how could this 
film go wrong? “The 
Thing” details the story 
of a research team in 
the Antarctic that dis-
covers a parasitic alien 
presence. 

Aside from being 
the biggest sausage fest 
in the known universe 
(even the dog is male), 
“Thing” is an excel-
lent horror movie that 
exploits the classic 
thriller theme of mys-
terious rabid disease. 
Though you might 
have seen it done since 
in “The Invasion” and 
“The Faculty,” the idea 
originated from this 
fresh take on claustro-
phobic paranoia. It’s 
an enjoyably tense ride 
on which no one and 
nowhere is safe. 

T hough most of us can’t remember the 1982 release of 
this cutesy alien flick, 
only the unborn have 
never heard E.T’s heart-
wrenching request to 
“phone home.” What 
childhood would be 
complete without the 
story of Elliot (Henry 
Thomas) and Gertie 
(Drew Barrymore), two 
siblings who discover a 
pint-sized alien in their 
backyard? They teach 
their wrinkly visitor 
everything about Earth 
culture, from basic 
language to Halloween 
dressup. In return, 
E.T. eats all of their 
candy and establishes 
a psychic connection 
with Elliot that makes 
everyone think he’s psy-
chotic. Before Spielberg 
developed a bad habit 
of throwing money into 
terrible Shia Labeouf 
films, he invented the 
warm, fuzzy feeling 
with golden-age “E.T.” 

T his classic made QT’s last name a verb (Tarantino: 
to upset a film’s time 
sequence so severely 
that all heads in the 
audience cock to one 
side in confusion and 
awe). If you’re unfa-
miliar with Tarantino’s 
particular blend of 
blood and verbal lyri-
cism, this is the perfect 
introduction. In 1994, 
he had just enough 
popularity to garner 
a decent budget, but 
not so much that it 
clouded his judg-
ment (see “Kill Bill, 
Part Douche”). Three 
seemingly unrelated 
stories cross each other 
unexpectedly in this 
masterly woven tale 
of a mob boss and his 
heroin-addicted wife, 
the boxer he paid to 
throw a match and 
two very Travolta and 
Jackson hitmen. 

W hat happens when Jim Henson aban-
dons his Muppet fam-
ily to team up with 
David Bowie for an 
’80s fantasy film about 
a Goblin King? 

Pure magic. In a 
style characteristic 
of the time (think 
“Gremlins,” “Big 
Trouble in Little 
China” and “Legend”), 
a caterpillar-eye-
browed Jennifer 
Connelly has to tra-
verse a magical laby-
rinth to retrieve her 
baby brother from the 
clutches of Jareth the 
Goblin King — com-
plete with fairy dust 
and an embarrassingly 
large codpiece. You’ll 
love this film (if you 
don’t already) for its 
unabashed camp and 
knee-slapping puppet-
ry. After all, Henson 
isn’t happy unless his 
hand is up the skirt 
of one character or 
another.

J ust a little less than two weeks until the premiere of “Lost”’s final season, and I’m getting 
antsy. Think about all the questions 
we need answered: Is John Locke 
really dead, and is that mysterious 
Man in Black possessing him? What 
caused the statue of Tawaret to be 
destroyed, leaving only a foot behind? 
What happened when the hydrogen 
bomb exploded and everything went 
white — did Oceanic 815 land in Los 
Angeles? 

Judging by the newly confirmed 
title of season six’s first episode, “LA 
X,” it’s still up for debate. The “X” in 
the acronym is deliberately separated 
from “LA” by a space, conjuring up 
images of Los Angeles International 
but also hinting that “X” is a variable. 

As Faraday clearly explains in season 
five’s “The Variable”: “Whatever hap-
pened, happened. All right? But then I 
finally realized ... I had been spending 
so much time focused on the con-
stants, I forgot about the variables. Do 
you know what the variables in these 
equations are, Jack?”

In essence, Faraday is saying that 
Jack, Kate and company have the 
power to mess with time and the 
universe if they use big enough tools 
— the hydrogen bomb being the 
boulder in the proverbial river. So 
it’s clear they can change the course 
of history, but that doesn’t answer 
anything. We’re left waiting for the 
last episodes like crack connoisseurs 
who’ve invested lots of time, money 
and energy in their crack hobby — 
which is why I’ve decided to provide 
my own all-encompassing theory 
that explains every single answer to 
LOST …wait for it: lizards. Seven-
foot-tall, bloodthirsty, shape-shifting 
lizards.

In truth, these past few weeks 
I’ve been reading conspiracy theo-
ries on the Interwebs — you know, 
the Bilderberg Group, the 9/11 
Conspiracy, mind control, etc.— 
and I stumbled on the Godfather 
of them all: David Icke. His dense 
New Age book “The Biggest Secret” 
spends over 500 pages weaving trans-
lated ancient texts and secondhand 
accounts of lizard man sightings all 
to conclude that the world’s elite are 
really a disguised alien race called the 
Annunaki planning global domina-
tion. So in honor of Mr. Icke, I’m 
going to transpose his fairly insane 
yet compelling theories onto the 
world of “Lost” speculation.

Here we go:
Jacob and the Man in Black are 

both highly evolved reptilians; one 
embraces humans and leads them 
to the island’s secrets, and the other 
has no faith in humanity. They have 
existed on Earth since ancient times, 
at least dating back to the Egyptians, 
but have never reached out openly 
to humans until the fateful day that 
Jacob calls the Black Rock (a 19th 
century slave ship) to the Island. 
One of the passengers on this ship 
is the mysterious Richard Alpert, 
still unfamiliar with the Island’s 
magic, but Jacob takes him under his 
wing and teaches him about eternal 
life. Richard becomes Jacob’s pri-

F or the next six weeks, Landmark Ken Cinema on Adam’s Ave. is showing $7.25 classics every Saturday at midnight. That’s right: one big steaming pile of nostalgia for the price of a decent 
hamburger. Though the Ken may be a couple miles more distant than 
our local La Jolla Village Cinemas, the newly made-over “Midnight 
Madness” series is well worth the trek — and what its film selection 
has lost in subversive overtones, it’s gained in cult cred.

D o you enjoy blasts of white noise? How about harnessed feed-
back anarchy, when instru-
ments turn incoherent? 

At first, HEALTH 
might not seem like your 
sonic bag. The LA four-
some culls power-tronics 
and abrasive beats from 
bashing experimentalists 
like Liars and manage to 
cram in post-punk, hard-
core and techno sheen. But 
get this: no screaming. Just 

Jake Duzsik’s ghost-in-the-
machine monotone sylla-
bles, a lulling counterpoint 
to the madness behind him. 

Not as immediately 
tasty as last week’s Vampire 
Weekend expose, but you 
need bands like HEALTH 
to yank your mind in dis-
parate directions with gui-
tar stabs and tempo shifts.

Dip your toes into the 
great, murky pool that is 
HEALTH’s alienation with 
new single “Die Slow,” 

and watch the morphing 
chords and ’90s rap-speed 
beat grab you. Intrigued? 
Wade further with “We 
Are Water,” a hardcore drill 
sergeant wrapped in dance 
gauze, to keep the head 
nodding and tease at some-
thing more visceral. 

Finally, to prepare your 
body for the show this 
Saturday, try “Triceratops” 
off their self-titled debut. 
A feedback swirl and crash 
cymbals lead into a robo-

strobe beat, riding in like a 
freak train, barely waiting 
for you to hop on before 
devolving into A.D.D. 
squalor. The last third of the 
track reaches ambient trem-
olo bliss as BJ Miller slams 
the shit out of his toms until 
they fade to paced drums. 
HEALTH proves rock can 
still shock — it hasn’t all 
been done before.  

Weirdo-poppers Tape 
Deck Mountain open for 
HEALTH.

INTERVIEW

Guardian: What did you guys try 
to do on Get Color to branch out 
from the first record? In what ways 
have you succeeded? 
John Famiglietti: More repetition, 
making everything more “song-
based” and more grooves. I think 
we mostly succeeded in evolving 
and progressing our sound, but 
we’d like to go much farther. 
G: Do you see the band moving 
toward a more dance-oriented 
sound on the next release? Where

HIATUS� THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�7

are your heads at right now in your 
vision of HEALTH for this year? 
JF: Well, yes actually, because 
our next release is DISCO2, the 
sequel to our remix album, which 
is naturally dancey. But for future 
HEALTH projects, yes with an ‘and,’ 
and if with a ‘but,’ not gonna make 
an album of dance beats, but defi-
nitely want to keep streamlining the 
“groove” aspect and produce things 
in a way that is more electronic 
bassy. 
G: How do you engage the audi-
ence in spaces that might not be as 
conducive to your frantic live show? 
The Loft is a fairly upscale bar and 
lounge, for example. What’s your 
mentality when getting ready to play 
at a space like that? 
JF: We just do it. We’ve really con-
ditioned ourselves from years of 
playing; We can do it anywhere. 
Also for college shows, it’s par for 
the course. 
G: What band is inspiring you guys 
most right now in what you’re doing 
with your own music, and why? Any 
new bands from LA you want to 
shout out? 
JF: No one really, and I’m not being 
a dick. We do keep taking influence 
from other music, but it’s mostly 
just song concepts or musical 
tricks. At the moment we’re listen-
ing to Top-40 radio … really dying 
for a good new record to listen to 
at the moment. There’s a new band 
in LA called TEARIST, which I 
think is pretty cool. Also, I’d love 
to shout out Pictureplane from 
Denver — his 2009 album Dark Rift 
is amazing. 
G: After the SD show, you guys are 
going to quickly tour Canada and 
then it’s off to New Zealand and 
Australia. What was it like getting 
that tour booked? 
JF: Well, there’s never really much 
of an adventure of getting a tour 
booked, its just some e-mails, and 
you cross your fingers.
G: Do you have any vacation plans 
while you’re there, aside from play-
ing music? 
JF: Totally. We’ve never been, so 
we’re taking days off to hang (which 
we rarely do on most tours). Hoping 
to hit up the black sand beaches and 
see some countryside. 
G: What’s HEALTH’s dream collabo-
ration? If you could do a song with 
any artist working now, who would 
you pick and why? 
JF: We’ve always wanted to do a song 
with Johnny Jewel of Glass Candy.  
G: P.S. My funny HEALTH fact: 
Way back when, there was a post 
on Craigslist wanting a vocalist for 
a band based in LA, listing influ-
ences like Liars and the Locust ... 
it was you dudes. My hometown 
is Thousand Oaks, a suburb about 
45 minutes north of Los Angeles, 
but I answered the post because I 
was looking to join a new band and 
I loved all the influences you had 
put down. At the time, it bummed 
me out that I couldn’t join (I think 
I was still in high school). Just 
thought I’d share that, take it easy 
guys. 
JF (laughing): I forgot about that. We 
never used anyone from the ad by 
the way.

“Waltz with Bashir” is an award-winning Israeli documen-

soldier who fought with the Israel Defense Forces in 
1982 — oh, and it’s animated. The film depicts Folman 
in search of his lost memories from the Lebanon War.  
While a friend whom he fought alongside during his 
years of service is still haunted by nightmares connected 
to their experience in combat, Folman can remember 
nothing. Find out why this provocative tale was consid-

‘We Can Do It
Anywhere’

T he newest album from Brit-rockers Editors should serve as a poster child for 
the grim side of taking a risk, 
when ambition goes awry and 
experiments turn ugly. Perhaps 
seeking to deviate from their 
formulaic yet wildly successful 
UK chart-topping imitation of 
similarly dark alt-rock groups 
like Interpol and U2, In This 
Light and On This Evening 
jettisons glitzy guitar riffs 
for monotonous synthesizers 

scrubbed of the edgy pizzazz 
that characterized their earlier 
work. 

Lead singer Tom Smith’s 
lyrics, delivered in a crystal-
clear drone that only heightens 
its banality, achieves torturous 
levels of incoherence on nearly 
all nine interminable tracks. 
Long stretches of bland synth-
bass noodles underline both 
the poor editing and conspicu-
ous underuse of guitars that 
made Editors’ previous two 
albums a pleasurable, if rather 
predictable, listen. The soar-
ing emotional power present 
in bygone Editors classics like 
“Smokers Outside The Hospital 
Doors” and “Munich” is lack-

ing in wannabe anthems like 
“You Don’t Know Love” — a 
static and mechanical cut that 
personifies everything subpar 
about Evening. There are a 
handful of bright spots, like 
“Papillon” — Smith’s stand-
and-deliver hook paired with 
slickly up-tempo drums and 
synthesizers to make it a stand-
out track — but these flashes of 
brilliance are obscured under 
the rest of the album’s sludge. 
Editors tried to change the 
game with Evening, but all they 
come up with is 45 minutes of 
depressing gunk.

The Remnants of  a 
UK Synth-periment
Go Awry

Ringo Starr
Y Not
HIP-O

10

R ingo Starr is too damn busy to write you an autograph.He’s got too much on his 
plate — peace and love, folks. He’s 
busy singing indie-soft over a col-
lection of wannabe chart-toppers. 
Stuffed with disco synths and sweet, 
meaningless nothings, it’s hard to tell 
whether Y Not is a revitalizing sound 
for the 70-year-old former Beatle or a 
delayed midlife crisis.

Take duet “Walk With You.” It’s 
an airy love song with fellow Beatle 
Paul shoved ignominiously into 
the background, muddling through 
predictable rhymes and gimme-an-
Emmy sentimentality. After that, 
we’re in for a barrage of tracks like 
“Everyone Wins” — peacenick 
anthems, bizarrely set to Alanis 
Morissette melodies. 

If you can stomach that sug-
ary stupidity, though, Ringo comes 
through with ZZ Top blues like 

“The Other Side of Liverpool.” This 
streetwise track is vintage blues-rock, 
matching down-on-your-luck lyrics 
with a wobbly guitar with a wailing 
organ. It’s a refreshing change, and 
you can hear Ringo’s smile as he lays 
down some catchy blues. The ridicu-
lously named “Who’s Your Daddy” 
is a tongue-in-cheek throwback to 
“R.E.S.P.E.C.T.,” with soul singer 
Joss Stone guest-starring as the had-
enough liberated woman kicking a 
deadbeat Starr to the curb.

There are only four blues num-
bers, though, and Y Not sinks with 
Ringo’s attempt at the fame game. 
The clock’s ticking for the septua-
genarian, and unless he cranks out 
more like “The Other Side,” he’d have 
been better off sticking with Thomas 
the Tank Engine.

5iLTife Crisis Drowns in S]perÅKiaT Sentiment
I t seemed like the Minneapolis boys of Motion City Soundtrack were finally on the verge of some 
serious radio play: They moved to a 
fancy label, snagged a veteran pow-
er-chord virtuoso Mark Hoppus as 
co-producer and cranked their Moog 
synthesizer to a nearly unbearable 
blast. 

Unfortunately, the bubblegum 
pop on My Dinosaur Life is little 
more than an overproduced rehash 
of the band’s limited repertoire: 
fast-paced, hyper-lyrical storytelling, 
climaxing in butter-smooth cries 
of self-loathing and forced irony. 
With a hotshot producer on board, 
you’d think they’d ease up on the 
high-school poetry (“There’s a buzz/ 
There’s a buzz/ There’s a buzzing of 
bugs”) and indulge in the kind of 
melodic simplicity that made their 
first efforts — “Feels Like Rain,” 
“The Future Freaks Me Out” — so 
freewheeling. 

Instead, we get a haggard Justin 
Pierre bitching about pharmaceutical 
evils, something about a tourniquet, 
dinosaurs and dreams. Notable 
exceptions to their nonsensical bab-
bling are “Skin and Bones,” which 
employs jumpy repetition to rival 
Fall Out Boy, and “Stand Too Close,” 
paring down every song’s obnoxious 
synth layers and cutting to recall a 
bit of their original simplicity. 

By far the stupidest track is 
“@!#?@!” (Did I get that right? Am 
I missing an octothorpe?), which is 
apparently what Pierre was thinking 
of when he described the album as 
“edgy”: “You all need to go away, you 
motherfuckers/ You all need to leave 
me and my homeboys alone.” Really. 
And the rest is so forgettable that it’s 
better left as background music to 
the next episode of “Gossip Girl.”

ALBUMREVIEW

T his Florida band’s name might sound like a late-night B-movie, but the debut album from Surfer Blood is just as velvet-soft and vox-dominated 
as anything by the Shins or the Smiths. These indie-
rockers are so new, they don’t even have a Wikipedia 
page (I admit it, I looked), but they’re already knee-
deep in dust — covered in such a film that five min-
utes after you turn off your iPod, you’ve forgotten 
everything but a five-second lick.

Linchpin of their sudden popularity “Swim” 
starts off with a catchy hook and Benatar-esque 
power chords, but the riffs start rambling halfway 
through, and the track drowns in distortion. The 
vocals echo so long, it’s like bad karaoke: The chorus 
is the only time we can make out the words.

Astro Coast does serve up a few clean cuts, 
especially “Neighbour Riffs,” an instrumental with 
ringing guitars much like Eric Johnson’s “Cliffs of 
Dover.” Other than that, though, the only bright 
sides are “Take It Easy” and closer “Catholic 
Pagans.” We can hear the lyrics, but they still don’t 
make much sense: “Please don’t padlock/ Your 
parents’ bomb shelter/” It’s ridiculous, but “Easy”’s 
tropical toe-tapping groove mesmerizes us into not 
caring about even the most terrible lyrics.

“Easy” and “Pagans” might get the fuzz-meter 
right, but they can’t save Coast. Surfer Blood did 
record the album in a dorm room, so a little pro-
fessional mixing might make all the difference. For 
now, if we want to spend almost an hour wonder-
ing what’s going on, we’d be better off in the last 
row of o-chem.

I f I wanted to listen to generically crappy indie alt-rock, I’d cue up Hoobastank. But Spoon is a group we expect a little more out of. Or a lot more. From the same men who 
brought us the awesomely catchy and peculiar Ga Ga Ga Ga 
Ga in 2007, seventh studio record Transference should have 
been, at the very least, a rung above mediocre.

But Transference doesn’t transcend anything. It’s like Spoon 
went into the indie-rock handbook and followed a step-by-step 
formula on how to write a semi-hit. Each cut has an unwaver-
ing, steady pace, plodding along without any variety before 
coming to an abrupt end.

But this isn’t as bothersome as the fact that they all run at 
least a minute too long. This is the A.D.D. Twitter generation; 
how do you expect us to pay attention for an extra minute of 
bass drum and guitar strums when we get impatient waiting 
for a Web page to load? 

In its journey to experiment with new genre trends, Spoon 
dabbles with odd echoic Auto-Tune on “Is Love Forever?” and 
“Who Makes Your Money.” As a result, the album’s overall aes-
thetic is awfully inconsistent, jumping abruptly from fast-paced 
feel-good melody “The Mystery Zone” to “Written in Reverse,”  
a chugging number with somber piano plunks and raw, aggro 
vocals. 

The LP’s saving grace is “I Saw the Light,” which weaves 
smooth vocals and blown-out riffs with calmer ones, and an 
epic buildup with some “Fuck yeah!” strumming that com-
pletely shifts gears mid-song, keeping our attention spans in 
check.

For the most part, Spoon plays a crappy version of their 
garage-rock facade, resulting in 11 run-of-the-mill tunes that 
aren’t terrible, but definitely aren’t anything we’ll put on repeat. 
Guess it’s time to switch to sporks.

to follow a man later identified as 
Harold Fullmer (Frank Wood) on a 
train from Chicago to Los Angeles.

Like the average college kid, 
Rosow survives on alcohol and cof-
fee, minimal sleep and grudgingly 
does what he is told. So naturally, he 
embarks on the cross-county jour-
ney without question. On the way, 
he uncovers Fullmer’s identity as 
a missing person; one of the thou-
sands presumed dead after the 9/11 
terrorist attacks. 

Tempted by a $500,000 reward, 
he must decide whether or not to 
bring the missing guy back to his 
wife in New York City against his 
will. 

The discovery prompts Rosow to 
explore his own painful memories 
of the 9/11 tragedy — a dramatic 
tale of love, loss and moral ambigu-
ity — with the help of his assistant 
and love interest (Amy Ryan), a 
process that allows him to better 
understand the reason for Fullmer’s 
purposefully long absence.

Imbued with black silhouettes 
against a cityscape, a score chock 
full of jazz and a whole heap of 
cigarette smoke, Buschel’s work 
is sure to receive more than a few 
accolades for its triumph in cinema-
tography, despite its lack in script 
development. Shannon’s pained 
and effortlessly cool performance 
succeeds in earning a few nods and 
smoothing out the film’s occasional 

plot fallacies.
The awkwardly sewn together 

9/11 reference is diced with a rather 
sluggish and anti-climactic plot, 
leaving Buschel’s creation with a 
distinct Frankenstein-esque feel: 
lumbering through with occasion-
ally charming characters before fad-
ing into smoky, ashen darkness.

While it thankfully strays from 
the normal decorum of a 9/11 
script, witty dialogue regarding 
Chinese food and misunderstood 
jokes only creates an awkward 
dichotomy — a film that is unsure 
about its identity and moral convic-
tion.

Buschel’s repeated hurrahs to 
New York locals, while humorous, 
begs the impression that the direc-
tor will, at any moment, burst on 
to the screen and scream “Where 
my homeboys at?” Likewise, half-
hearted attempts at comedy like 
Segway riding cops only provide 
brief moments of relief in an other-
wise dull film. 

Buschel’s script is hopelessly 
tame, lacking the action and bone-
chilling mystery we have come to 
expect from a neo-noir film of the 
last decade.

Nonetheless, “The Missing 
Person” makes a tremendous effort 
to walk the perilous line between 
old and new, making it an interest-
ing — if largely unsuccessful —
addition to the long list of noir that 
precedes it.

mary messenger and assistant for the 
human world, taking leadership of 
the others (the rest of the people on 
the ship) and overseeing them as they 
adapt to the island.

More than a century later, Jack, 
Locke, Kate and all the rest of the 
important players receive a special 
visit by Jacob, who pushes them in 
the direction of the island, ensur-
ing their fate on the Oceanic flight. 
It’s unclear what Jacob intends for 
these humans — perhaps they have 

more potential 
than the rest 
of human-
ity, or maybe 
they’re part 
lizard and they 
don’t even real-
ize it — but he 
guides them to 
the event-chain 
plane crash that 
begins “Lost.”

Going with 
the lizard motif, 
what if Jack and 
John’s fathers 

were also part of this reptilian blood-
line, hiding out as civilians in human 
disguises and having children with 
human females? It would explain a 
lot about the fathers’ self-destructive, 
manipulative behavior and why both 
Christian Shephard and Anthony 
Cooper (Locke’s dad) can never seem 
to relate to their children (heck, 
Anthony even does malicious things 
like steal Locke’s kidney and push 
him out of a window). It would also 
answer why Christian and Anthony 
both appear on the island as if out 
of thin air, and why Christian guides 
Locke to push the underground 
wheel that stops all the wacky time 
travel.

Ultimately, the “Lost” writers have 
an absurd undertaking here. Trying 
to wrap up all these loose ends and 
plot holes, they just might need an 
ancient lizard conspiracy. Yes, it 
sounds so crazy that I’m not sure 
I even believe it. But come May, I 
might be having the last laugh.

the correct avenues. We are well aware of how 
to work with the administration.”�

As it stands, only Souder and Campus 
Sustainability Analyst Kristin Hansen hold a 
permanent office in the center. Students and 
community members alike are permitted to 
schedule meetings or events in the center, 
but are not allowed occupy the space as joint 
directors.

“I would love to make sure there is really 
good access for anyone that doesn’t exclude 
everybody,” Souder said. “We want a space 
where anyone and everyone feels welcome. 
Ultimately, we’re running it by my bosses; I 
want to make sure they’re comfortable. The 
administration has committed a lot of money 
and effort, and I want to make sure the uni-
versity is happy.”�

While SSC members are able to reserve the 
SRC for weekly meetings, they are unable to 
use the center as a main office.�

“We have no functional office space or 
meeting place,” Ghosh said. “There is no pub-
lic space where we can display our projects. 
We can’t put anything on the shelves [in the 
SRC]. We can’t put anything on the walls. 
We can only be there at certain hours. We’re 
forced to run our programs with no central 
locations.”�

Various programs the SSC is attempting 
to house in the SRC include an extension of 
the TritonBikes rental program, along with an 
e-waste drop-off center that would properly 
dispose of broken electronics.�

“We want to set up an e-waste center,” 
Ghosh said. “We can’t do that project right 
now, though, since we have no space to pub-
licize to students. We aren’t even allowed to 
enter the space.”�

Ghosh said that the SSC feels there is even 
difficulty setting up meetings under the cur-
rent arrangements.�

“We don’t get preference in the scheduling 
process,” Ghosh said. “[Souder] can schedule 
over us if she finds out when our meetings 
are. She’s treating us as a non-involved third 
party who she just lets use the space.”�

Souder holds that the center has been very 
productive and useful during the time it has 
been open, despite the SSC’s lack of a role in 
managing the center.�

“It’s already proven to be great,” Souder 
said. “The space is already being well-utilized 
by many, including students, faculty and staff.”�

The SSC is currently working with the A.S. 
Council to expedite the process to reach an 
MOU.�

“We’ve decided we need to stop negotiat-
ing with [Souder] directly,” Ghosh said. “Our 
talks weren’t productive. We were going back-
wards. She kept rescinding promises. Now 
we’re working through A.S. and various vice 
chancellors, who are her supervisors. They 
can make it clear an anti-student activity will 

not be tolerated at 
UCSD. If things 
don’t go well, we 
won’t hesitate to 
meet with the chan-
cellor herself.”�

Gupta said he 
supports the SSC’s 
efforts to attain a 
physical place in the 
SRC.�

“The SRC is part 
of A.S.,” Ghosh said. 
“The students in the 
SSC are employees 
of A.S., which is a 
department of the 
university. We’re 

going to make sure they’re treated with respect 
— the same respect any administrator would 
receive. It should be two departments working 
together.”�

Gupta said he intends to re-open discus-
sions between the SSC and CSS, bringing 
in higher administrators including Souder’s 
supervisor Assistant Vice Chancellor Russell 
Thackston. Gupta said he also plans on meet-
ing with the University Centers Advisory 
Board to discuss the current state of the SRC, 
along with its intended purpose.�

“We had met with the University Centers 
Advisory Board,” Gupta said. “They reviewed 
the space agreement with the intent that stu-
dents were to share in the space. I’ve spoken 
with the UCAB chair. We’ll be presenting to 
them sometime in the next few weeks.”

in Arizona and decided he wanted to take some 
time and travel, see the world, volunteer… He 
had just gotten there on Sunday and was sup-
posed to stay for a little while before the earth-
quake hit.” 

Ryan was a member of the UCSD swim team 
and swam breaststroke for four years, despite 
recurring knee injuries. 

“He fought through a lot of injuries while 
he swam, but he never once thought about not 
swimming,” Costa said. “The team really meant 
the world to him, and I think it’s been really hard 
for a lot of the alumni that swam with him for 
years.”  

 In addition to his involvement with the 
swim team, Ryan was also a writer for the Muir 
Quarterly, a satirical newspaper that, according 
to Costa, allowed him to showcase his sense of 
humor. 

“He had this sarcastic humor that was really 
quick — really witty,” Costa said. “When we 
were freshmen, he and a few of the other swim 

guys used to sneak into our apartment while we 
were at dinner and invert all of our furniture. 
This happened a few times before we actually 
figured out who it was.” 

The Kloos family has asked that any dona-
tions in Ryan’s memory be made to Friends of the 
Orphans at 1-888-201-8880 or www.friendsoft-
heorphans.org, in honor of Erin and Ryan Kloos.

“Ryan just showed a lot of love to everyone 
around him,” Costa said. “He loved his family, 
he loved his school, he loved his chosen career 
path and he showed that every day; it’s kind of 
that feel for life that we’re all hanging on to.” 

Ryan’s family is currently at a Miami hospital 
with his sister Erin, who was also injured in the 
quake. She is now in stable condition.

“Knowing my son, Ryan, for only 24 years is 
so much better than never having known him at 
all,” John Kloos said. “No son has ever made his 
family prouder.”

the council — including VP Student Life, VP 
Finance and AVP Concerts and Events — as well 
as the Graduate Student Association president 
and UCAB chair. 

In contrast, Taylor’s version allowed for the 
current UCAB governing board — composed of 
members of the six college councils, as well as 
administrators and alumni — to review the funds 
appropriated to the Loft. 

Gupta said he was pushing for the maximum 
amount of student oversight, especially because 
UCAB is known for being under the administra-
tive thumb.

“When you’re deciding where to place hun-
dreds of thousands of student fees collected 
every quarter every year, you better put it in a 
place that can perform effective and real over-
sight,” he said. “I do not feel comfortable in 
placing these fees with the University Centers 
Advisory Board.” 

Taylor said that UCAB was capable of reg-
ulating the Loft’s finances because members 
had experience dealing with student fees — 

as opposed to the as-of-yet nonexistent Loft 
Governance Board. 

“UCAB is a fully functioning board, not a 
committee,” he said. “We control a $10 million 
budget, most of it in student fees.”

The UCAB model of the referendum passed 
by a vote of 16-11-3, due to concerns that the 
oversight provided by Gupta’s model was excessive. 

Loft Director Martin Wollesen said the night’s 
debate was valuable, and praised the council’s deci-
sion to place the referendum on the ballot. 

“There was comparable evidence — from 
attendance records to signatures to A.S.’s own 
surveys — that the students want to be able to 
vote,” Wollesen said. “I would have been disap-
pointed if A.S. didn’t listen to the student voice.”

If passed, the fee would go into effect Fall 
Quarter 2010 and be charged every quarter until 
Spring Quarter 2014 — at which point it would 
terminate unless renewed by a majority A.S. 
Council vote.

Reach Higher

Neither team was able to gain a 
firm hold on proceedings, especially 
early on, as evidenced by the 33 ties in 
the match — eight of which occurred 
in the first set. The Tritons trailed 
behind 3-0, but quickly turned things 
around to take the lead 8-7 with a 
kill from Kiani. UCSD and UCSB 
went back and forth until the Tritons 
ultimately claimed the first set 27-23, 
due to a Gaucho error. Junior middle 
blocker Adrian Guthals’ kill sealed 
the set at 30-26.

In the second set, the Gauchos 
jumped out to an 11-6 lead, until 
the Tritons fought back to 12-10. 
However, UCSB was able to stave off 
the comeback attampt, and ultimately 
claimed the second set with a 30-24 
victory.

The Tritons started out on top in 
the third set with a 10-6 lead, thanks 

to a block from Fritsch and junior 
middle blocker Calvin Ross. UCSB 
fought back to tie the set at 
18-18 until UCSD scored 
four straight points topped 
off with an ace from Ross to 
lead 22-18.

But the Gauchos fought 
on, and tied the set at 
27-27. Fortunately for the 
Tritons, two errors from 
UCSB and a Ross kill were 
enough to hand them the 
set at 27-30.

In the fourth set, UCSB 
broke the 11-11 tie to take 
a 20-15 lead. The Tritons 
worked to bring the score 
to 25-24, minimizing the 
Gaucho’s lead to only one 
point. Despite the Tritons’ best 
efforts, they lost the set 30-27.

In the fifth and final set, the 

Tritons started off with a 9-8 lead, 
but could not improve on their .095 

attack percentage as the 
Gauchos hit at a .316 clip. 
UCSB eventually sealed 
a 15-13 win, ending the 
match in its favor.

“In the match [against 
UCSB], we were better 
at passing,” head coach 
Kevin Ring said. “Due 
to that, we played better 
offensively and [kept] a 
more balanced attack.”

The loss against 
UCSB followed UCSD’s 
Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation sea-
son opener at No. 2 
Cal State Northridge 

on Wednesday, Jan. 13. There, 
the Tritons were defeated 30-24, 
30-26 and 30-28 at the hands of 

the Matadors, extending their win-
less streak against Northridge to 35 
matches.

The Tritons were outhit by the 
Matadors .320 to .174. Fritsch led the 
way for the Tritons with 16 kills on 
.33 hitting. Spangler had seven kills. 
Bannan offered 29 assists, five digs 
and four kills in the game. Guthals 
led the team with six blocks and five 
kills on .625 hitting. Freshman libero 
Chase Frishman had a team-high 
eight digs in the game.

Fritsch tied the first set at 16-16 
with a kill. However, Cal State 
Northridge won the first set with a 
score of 30-24.

The Tritons scored the first three 
points of the second set. With the 
score tied 14-14, both teams battled 
until the Matadors topped the Tritons 
and won the set 30-26.

In the closely fought third set, 

Bannan sent a kill to tie the set at 
23-23. After the Matadors cruised to 
a two-point lead, the Tritons retied 
the set at 26-26 through an ace from 
Spangler. Moments later, Fritsch sent 
down a kill to again tie the set at 
28-28. At the end of the dramatic 
set, Cal State Northridge claimed 
the set victory at 30-28 with a kill 
and block.

“For the next match, we need 
to continue passing well,” Ring said. 
“In order for us to be competitive, 
we need to sideout with more con-
sistency.”

The Tritons will return to action on 
Jan. 20 against Pepperdine University 
before heading to Los Angeles to play 
University of Southern California on 
Jan. 22.

Evans is shining for a Kings team 
that is, as Charles Barkley would say, 
“turrible” beyond belief. If there is any

San Jose rumors, Evans might be play-

Honorable Mention: the Warrior’s 
Stephen Curry.

Monta Ellis said it couldn’t be 
done, but he and Stephen Curry have 
been tearing up the backcourt for the 
Warriors lately — even if the rest of 
the team is struggling to bring Golden 
State out from the cellar. But seriously, 
what were the Warriors thinking, let-
ting Ellis answer questions about Curry 
without prepping him first? Have you 
heard the man talk? He can run faster 
than most of the league, but put him 
in front of a mic and he’s slower than 
Bengie Molina rounding first base.

 Still, Monta came around once 
Stephen Curry got in the rhythm of 
things. On Monday against the Bulls, 
Curry had 26 points, 10 rebounds and 
six assists. And his outside shot that 
brought him to stardom in college 
is starting to show up in the pros — 
Curry hit five tres against the Bulls.

I just realized I got through this 
whole NBA column without men-
tioning everyone’s favorite star: Kobe 
Bryant.

There. Now I still have a shot at 
becoming a professional sports jour-
nalist in Southern California.

need to prove ourselves.”
In last year’s historic season, the 

Tritons posted a 27-9 overall record, 
including a perfect 16-0 record at 
home during conference play. The 
stretch included a four-game sweep 
of then-No. 1 Cal State Stanislaus.

UCSD claimed its second 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association championship and won 
the CCAA tournament, defeating 
Sonoma State University. The victo-
ries vaulted the team to No. 2 in the 
country in Division-II.  

After advancing past the NCAA 
West Regional, the Tritons reached 
the D-II College World Series in 
Cary, North Carolina for the first 
time ever, where they won two 
games before bowing out in the 
National Semifinal against Emporia 
State University.

After playing an underdog role 
for much of last season, being on 
top of the the preseason rankings 
this year gives the Tritons a new 
perspective.

“We like to say that our oppo-
nents are nameless and faceless,” 
Rossman said. “We’re not worried 
about who we’re playing or what 
they’re ranked.  Everyone is going to 
be gunning for us this year.”

Hoisting a target on their back, 
UCSD is looking to replace key 
cogs from last year’s squad. The 
Tritons lost the program’s all-time 
hits leader Garrett Imeson, all-time 
home-runs leader Matt Cantele and 
all-time wins leader Trevor Decker 
to graduation.

The team will also have to replace 
now assistant coach Josh Tanner, a 
.419 career hitter.

An influx of younger players and 
transfers will fill the voids, leaving it 
up to the returnees to keep the fresh 
faces grounded despite the hype.

“There will be times that we 
will have to deal with adversity 
and how we respond will be big,” 
senior shortstop and preseason All-
America Vance Albitz said. “Losses 
will definitely happen, and how we 
deal with them will come down to 
how the older guys act. We have 
been around a couple years and have 
seen it.”

Junior pitcher and All-American 
Tim Shibuya believes that the pre-
season accolades will help the team.

“Psychological warfare: It’s an 
honor that I don’t take lightly,” he 
said. We can use it against other 
teams. When teams come to play us, 
we have an advantage.”

According to Shibuya, success in 
the new season won’t be so much 
about talent and fundamentals, but 
will depend more on the players’ 
ability to gel as a team and conquer 
the often overlooked mental aspects 
of baseball.

“Last year we came together so 
much as a team that we were playing 
as a unit,” Shibuya said. “Every team 
hits and pitches; mental things are 
going to separate us.”

UCSD will open the season with 
18-straight home games at Triton 
Field, where the team lost only 
three times last season. The stretch 
includes a pair of preseason ranked 
opponents: No. 18 Western Oregon 
in non-conference play, and No. 22 
Chico State to open up the CCAA.

TRITON FENCERS TAKE ON NORTH AMERICA’S ELITE

By Jessy Jahangir
Contributing Writer

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 
11-ranked UCSD men’s volleyball 
team traveled to UC Santa Barbara 
on Saturday, Jan. 16, to play its second 
match this season in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation campaign. 
The Tritons were unsuccessful in 
securing their first victory in a very 
close seesaw match against the No. 
14-ranked Gauchos. UCSD lost with 
a final score of 26-30, 30-24, 27-30, 
30-27 and 15-13.

This was the fourth consecutive 
meeting between the two teams where 
the winner was decided in five sets. 
However, it was the first time that 
the Gauchos were victorious in the 
matches. The loss dropped the Tritons 
to 0-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation and 1-4 overall.

Leading the way for UCSD was

It’s mid-January, and even San Diego has shown some signs of “winter,” leaving its residents 
comically unprepared for the rain. 
So it’s time to talk football, right? 
Well, I’ve never been one to follow 
trends — heck, I’ve been a Warriors 
fan since before their “We Believe” 
days — and I refused to jump on the 
Chargers’ bandwagon this year. Let’s 
face it, after Nate Kaeding’s glorious 
suck-fest on Sunday, the last thing 
you want to hear is predictions for an 
AFC Championship game to which 
the Chargers so brilliantly botched 
their ticket.

So instead, here are a few of my 
midseason NBA awards. We’ll see if 
they have any relevance by the time 
summer rolls around.

Guy that screwed over his team the 
most: the Wizard’s Gilbert Arenas 

To be fair, Agent Zero’s biggest 
crime was being too serious a practi-
cal joker. In fact, we should applaud 
how committed he is to punking his 
teammates. I’m talking, of course, 
about bringing unloaded guns into 
the locker room and, alongside Javaris 
Crittenton, pointing them at each 
other. Maybe bringing in the guns and 
then joking about it later (Arenas and 
his teammates drew more attention 
to the scandal by making guns out of 
their hands on the sidelines) wasn’t as 
hilarious as they thought.

One thing I’ve learned from all 
of this: If I ever see a professional 
athlete out on the streets, I’m gonna 
make sure to be extra careful about 
what I say. Arenas was by no means 
packing light — accompanying his 
.50 caliber gold-plated semiautomatic 
was a .500 magnum revolver, a .45 
mm semiautomatic and a 9 mm. Who 
knows what would happen if he went 
all Plaxico Burress on us and loaded 
all his guns into his sweatpants? Four 
shots in the leg and indefinite sus-
pension wouldn’t have been the only 
thing that ruined his season.

Surprise Team of the (Mid) Year: 
Oklahoma City Thunder

Loyal readers know that I dedi-
cated my last column to picking apart 
the Sonicsgate fiasco from a couple 
of years ago that sent the Sonics to 
Oklahoma City. But the Thunder has 
really stepped up its game, thanks to 
third-year forward Kevin Durant. The 
former Rookie of the Year has led the 
team to 23 wins this season in half the 
time it took all its players combined 
last year. Durant has exceeded already 
high expectations for the year, aver-
aging 29.1 points per game and 7.1 
rebounds. Second-year point guard 
Russell Westbrook isn’t too shabby 
either, putting up 16.1 points and 7.5 
assists per game.

The Thunder is definitely not 
perfect — the team ranks in the top 
five in turnovers. But considering the 
nucleus of young players, they should 
start handling the ball better soon — 
hopefully in time to make a push for 
the playoffs this season.

Rookie of the (Mid) Year: the King’s 
Tyreke Evans.

It’s a close tie with Brandon 
Jennings’ ghetto ass, but Evans has 
been playing well of late and looks to 
be getting even better. The 20-year-old 
is averaging 20.8 points per game for 
the Kings, and has all the qualities of a

BIG CLEATS TO FILL

By Yvonne Chow
Staff Writer

FENCING — The best fencers on the western 
North American coast — from Canada to San 
Diego — gathered in San Jose from Jan. 15 to Jan. 
18 to compete for continental supremacy in the 
North American Cup.

The tournament featured over 260 competitors, 
and presented a wide range of competition for the 
UCSD fencers.

“This tournament really served to challenge and 
expose our athletes with world-class level fencing,” 
head coach Heidi Runyan said.

However, Runyan felt the timing of the tourna-
ment was not favorable for the team, since it’s prox-

imity to the recent BladeRunner tournament didn’t 
give the team enough time to recover or adjust their 
techniques. 

“We would have preferred if it came longer after 
the Christmas break,” Runyan said.

The tournament — structured in knock-out 
format — pitted players into groups of six or seven. 
Then, the competitors faced each other for top 
spots in the group. The group’s highest scorers were 
then placed into direct elimination rounds.

Despite the tournament’s inopportune timing and 
stiff competition, the UCSD fencers performed well.

Triton sophomore Michael Fong continued to 
find success in only his second year fencing, and 
placed 22nd out of 195 participants in the junior 
men’s foil. Fong has already placed second at the UC 

Irvine Collegiate Open and 5th at the BladeRunner 
Tournament this year. His finish marks a 22-spot 
improvement over his performance at last year’s 
NAC, where he placed 44th out of 188. 

Fong said that fencers come from all over North 
America to compete at NACs and the quality of the 
field is incredible.

“The competition is always fierce at NAC,” he 
said.  “It’s typical to fence against Olympians and 
world team members.  

UCSD now looks ahead to the Northwestern 
Duals that will take place in Evanston from Jan. 
30 to Jan. 31.

Men still looking for first 
win in conference play 
after showdown with
No. 14 UCSB.

By Vishal Natarajan� Sports Editor

BASEBALL — The UCSD baseball team is entering 
the upcoming 2009-10 season ranked as the No. 1 
team in the nation in Division-II by Ping!Baseball, 
and No. 3 by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper.

The team also boasts three Division-II preseason 
All-Americans — designations given to the best 
players in the country in their respective positions — 
as voted by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers 
Association.

All this, on the heels of a record-breaking 2008-
09 season.

In spite of the preseason praise and high expecta-
tions, however, the team is taking a workman’s atti-
tude to the upcoming season.

“Last season was arguably one of the best seasons 
in UCSD history,” senior pitcher and preseason 
All-American Matt Rossman said.  “As for this year, 
it doesn’t mean much.  All the preseason rankings 
are based on last year’s results — who’s coming in 
this year and the talent that’s returning. But we still
