'The 5th of May is celebrated as a 

national holiday in Mexico every year . 
Technically, it is the day com-
memorating the victory of the Mexican 
community over the invading French 
troops . When the Southwest became 
part of the United States, the Mexican 
people who lived and remained in the 
Southwest continued to celebrate this 
event-Cinco' de Mayo-as a tradition and 
as a symbol of their Mexican heritage. 

Pre.>ently, by celebrating Cinco de 
Mayo, we, as descendants of the 
original Southwest Mexican settlers, are 
able to present vital aspeCts of the 
contemporary Chicano cu lture. The 
Mexican experience, without doubt, is 
tied to that of the Chicano; thus 
bringing to the University community, 
and the community in general, a 
consciousness of the important on-
tributions which the M xican and 
Chicano people have giv n to orth 
America . 

Cinco de Mayo es celebrado 
anualmente como un dia de fiesta 
nadonal en Mexico. Tecnicamente, es 
el dia en que reconocemos la victoria 
del pueblo Mexicano contra la invacion 
de las tropas Francesas. Cuando el 
Suroeste [Aztlan] lIego a ser parte de los 
Estados Unidos, la gent~ Mexicana 
quienes vivian en el Suroeste [Aztlan J 
continuaron a celebrar est a ocasion-
Cinco de Mayo-como tradicion y 
simbolo de su cultura Mexicana. 

Actualmente, en celebrar el Cinco de 
Mayo, nosotros como descendientes de 
los originales habitantes Mexicanos del . 
Suroeste, podemos expresar im- ' 
port antes aspectos de la cultura 
contemporal Chicana. La exp~iencia 
Mexicana , sin duda , esta inex-
tricablemente ligada a la del Chicano; 
asi lIevando a la Universidad y com-
munidades locales conocimientos 
acerca de la importancia de las con-
tribuciones que han hecho los 
Mexicanos y Chicanos a Nortf'america.

As embly man John

"arrogant, litist attitude,"

" The Univer ity doesn't

With the real problems we 
are facing, as individuals 
and as a society," he said . 
"W have to change the

He noted that the state of 
alifor~ia funds the 

University to the tune of 
$400 million a year . "I don't 
think we should give it to a 
group of people who seem 
to be arrogant ."

Univ r ity admini tration : 
"Why should we give you 
any money? " forces it " to 
ask itself the right kinds of 
questions," he argued . The 
basic question that needs to 
be asked is : "What are 
ociety ' s educational 

needs?" 
The legislature, by " trying 

to build more student input 
into the decision-mak ing 
structure" and trying to 
speed up the im-
plementation of Affirmative

those needs, he claimed.

UC Ranks 43rd 
by Roberta Rehm 

Despite pay and benefit increases of 14.5 percent in 
the past two years, compensations for faculty at the 
University of California is ranked 43rd in the nation. 

The American Association of University Professors 
released a report this week revealing that while the 
average American professor received raises in salar and 
fringe fenefits amounting to 5979 during 1973·74, his 
buying power dropped 5271 short of last year's buying 
power because of inflation . This was the first time in 16 
years that faculty members lost ground economically, 
said the report . 

The average compensation of U.c. faculty members is 
521 ,900 this year. Full professors receive 527,200 in total 
compensations, associate professors, 518,800; a istant 
professors, 515,600; and instructors, S10,100. 

Once ranked in the top 10 nationally, com pen ations 
for U.c. faculty members fell to 78th place two ear 
ago. Increases in faculty pay of 9 percent last year and 
5.4 percent this year raised the lanking to 42nd lut year 
and held fairly constant at 43rd this year. 

"The experience of the year ' an be characterized by 
saying th~t institutions on the whole moderatel in-
creased their efforts to improve fhe economic situations 
of their faculties, but were OVErwhelmed by that old 

bug·a-be~r, inflation," stated th _ report . 
The City University of New York Graduate Center 

pays the hilhest compensation in the country at 
532,090, followed by City Colette, .......... CUNY unit ~t 
526,209. 

Besides the City university of New York and State 
University of New YorI!, public in titutions th:!' rank 
above U.c. are University of Michigan, 522,431 ; ant! 
Nassau Community CoIlqe, Lona Island, 526,2OCt. 

Hilhest ranllinl campuses in the Califomi.1 State 
University and Colletes system ~re San Francisco St"'e

OPINION York Speaks on Rockets-

Professor Herbert York of the physics 
department gave an open lecture 
Wednesday evening on the history of 
rockets and their connections with the 
arms race. Dr . York is a former 
presidential adviser and renowned expert 
on the arms race. 

Dr. York began with the three in-
ventors of the rocket. They worked in-
dependently (and without knowledge) of 
each other; Tsiolokovski in the U.S.S.R., 
Robert Goddard in the U.S.A ., and 
Herman Oberth in Germany and 
Rumania . In the U.S., rocket study was 
continued mainly by a group of scientists 
headed by Von Karman, working at what 
later became Cal Tech . The Jet 
PropulSion Lab (J PL ) was set up in 
Pasadena to study rockets, and the word 
" let" was used, since no one (including 
the government) took rockets seriously 
then . 

Attitudes changed. of course, with 
Germany's deployment of the V2 in 1944. 
(The Vl was not a rocket , but a pilotless 
plane) The German rocket research 
began 10 th e arly 1930's (before Hitler) 
under the leadership of Von Braun and 
Dornb rg r The German military en-
couraged rocket tudy because the 
Versa tlles Treaty did not prohibit their 
manufactur . a It did prohibit the 
manufacture of airplanes . In World War 
II, th rocket actually turned out to be a 
qUite minor component in the death and 
destru ction . The V2 's ca rri ed one 
(metric) ton of explosive, and by the nd 
of the war airplanes were carrying up to 
twenty tons The V2's were hard to hoot 
down because they were supersonic, and 
could not be heard coming (The " V" 
stood for "vengeance" and not "rocket" ). 

After the war, most of the rocket 
experts (Including Von Braun and 
Dornberger) defected to the U .S., rather 
tha n to the RUSSians . Several hundred 
technical experts were brought here, of 
which a.bout 130 were rocket experts . 

The U.S A . began with small (by 
today's standard s) programs Hermes 
used the V-2 for research, with the aid of 
General Electric and JPL. The Corporal-
Sargeant program led to the develop-
ment of the Polaris missiles . The Navaho 
program never came to fruition , though 

I t~ engines found their way to the Apollo 
rockets. Convair (of San Diego) was 
prime contractor for MX-774 , which later 
bt;'came Atlas . All of this was post war, 
bt;'gi nnlng about 1945. 

After 1945, satellites began to be taken 
wflous ly The Rand Corporation, a think 
tank In anta Moni a, was established in 
1946, and its fir t project was to study the 
ron ept of an experimental world-
(,I rcling space ship. The Rand Cor-
poration also studied possible uses for 
satellites, and concluded they were good 
for : guiding long range missiles, 
scientific purposes, and weather 
prediction . They also held out a 
possibility of incidental use as recon-
naissance, since they thought our 

cameras were inadequate . Today, of 
course, reconnaissance is by far the 
major use of satellites. Rand also thought 
it was essential to demonstrate the 
superiority of American technology by 
launching the first satellite. They wrote : 
" Imagine what it would be like if 
someone else put up first. " 

In fact Sputnik, the first 'satellite, was 
launched by the Russians in October 
1957. Its name translates as "fellow 
traveler. " The U.S. was tartled, but Dr . 
York pointed out that it should not have 
been . There was ample evidence to 
predict this action of the Russians, who 
had not even kept it secret . They had 
announced their intention to launch a 
satellite and our experts had believed 
them . The New York Times and Pravda 
had reported it . What made the im-
pending launch secret, Or. York ex-
plained, was the severe lack of general 
interest. 

For about ten years, the Russians 
stayed well ahead of the U.S. in space 
technology . The same reason that made 
them first in space, however, made it 
impossible for them to get to the moon . 
What the RUSSians did was to cluster 
about twenty of the (relatively) small V-2 
engines, insteao of building one big 
engine, as the Ameri cans did . This gave 
them a "dead-end technology" and short-
term gai ns by mortgaging the future . 

The U.S., however, according to Dr 
York, only paid attention to the Soviet's 
results and Kruschev's vague clai ms, such 
as "We are turning out rockets like 
sausages." In response to Russ ia's fa lse 
c laim of big missi les, we began our huge 
programs' Atlas, Titan, Minuteman, 
Polaris and Poseidon . (The last two are 
submarine launched) . 

The U.S. quickly built up a five year 
lead, and Russia has caught up only very 
re ently. Dr. York concluded there never 
was a "missile gap" for the U.S., and 
there always was for Russia, until 
recently . To give us an idea of the current 
magnitude of the U.S. capability, Dr. 
York pointed out that the U .S. has forty-
one submarines that carry 656 Polaris 
and Po ei don mi i les, and each missile 
has ten warhead s. That is, we have 6,560 
warheads on our submarines alone . (Each 
warhead is three time as destructive as 
the bomb used on Hiroshima). 

After the talk , slid s were shown, and 
then there was a di scussion period . Only 
fourteen peopl e attended the talk , 
lending credence to Dr York's theSIS that 
secrecy is best maintained by a severe 
lack of Simple intere t. Dr . York's next 
talk will be Wednesday, May 1, at 7:00 
p.m . on the second floor of Bldg 2A, 
Muir . He will speak on the various 
treaties, including the SALT talks, which 
deal with the arms race, and possibly 
comment on the new "counterforce" 
proposals that have been the topic of the 
press releases from the oHice of lames 
Schlesinger, spokesman for the Pen-
tagon, and our Secretary of " Defense."

Open Letter 
Editor ' 

It has come to my at-
tention that this campus is 
plagued by a series of 
scandals, some of them 
exposed and most of them 
not . I n reflecting on them, 
there seems to be a 
common basis for them all 
this is the general ' student 
'apathy ' and the idea shared 
by those people in power 
that they can do anything 
they like because the 
gener al student body is 
'apathetic .' I charge those 
people who think that this 
student body is 'apathetic' 
to ask themselves why. I 
believe it is because there IS 
a very limited area of ex-
pression ; that the students 
are repeatedly toid that 
they are apathetic ; that the 
official media on campus, 
except, thank the stars, on 
the editorial page, is very 
short on student news 
especially 10 what is ; oing 
on in student govern me . . , 
which I Will get to later, and 
lacks decent coverage of 
campus, loca l, state, and 
national news and opinion ; 
that areas of student 
congregation on campus is 
limited ; that the average 
student 's work load is 
ridiculously large 

On the subject of student 
government on campus, I 
wish to make a number of 
indictments : 
First, student government 

is too distant from the 
students and appar'i!ntly 
wished to remain so . 

Second, because there is 
'apathy, the students as 
'power' believe they can do 
as they wish, as some do .. 

Third, many in one body 
of student government do 
not know what another 
body does, presupposing 
they even know of that 
body, which some do not. 

Fourth, most students do 
not know there is a student 
government, what it does, 
who funds it , or what it 
offers . 

Fifth, if there is a student 
government, who gives it its 
right to exist, the ad-
ministration? The students 
certainly do not . 

Sixth, where is the 
student control of their own 
government? Where are the 
elections for any of the 
offices? 

Am I therefore to sup-
pose that students in 
general do not care what is 
going onr Who or what 
determines apathy? If a 
student has a problem, or 

wants to do )omNhlnl!, 
c h a n ge something , 
anythlng l where does he 
gol he does not know, how 
does he find out' he does 
not know; and neither does 
anybody else ThiS has to 
change. Still, they tell me 
that the students are 
apathetiC. but of course 
they would be If they did 
not know or could not flOd 
out

Renaissance 
Conferance 
UCLA's Center for 

Medieyal and Renaissance 
Studies, in conjunction with 
the major institutions of Los 
Angeles, is sponsoring an 
international conference of 
distinguished American and 
European scholars . The 
conference theme, " First 
Images of America . The 
Impact of the New World 
on the Old ," IS very 
promising, for the various 
topics are aim d at the 
study of a subject that has 
not been comprehensively 
investigated before. 

Recently , a number , of 
scholars have shown a 
lively interest concerning 
the multiple ways in which 
the discovery of the New 
World affected the thought , 
modes of life, and in-
stitutions of the Old . The 
results of these various 
aven ues of research 
resulting in the Conference 
will also be the object of a 
two-volume publication, 
presenting a full panorama 
of the social and political 
changes occasioned by the 
ell covery of Ameri ca 

The conference, set for

Amid much speculation about the possibili y of a 
Beatles-Reunion-tour and-Qr album soon, the L·.A . music 
scene's generated an all-new newsworthy rumor, this 
time concerning the upcoming Crosby, Stills, Nash & 
Young tour. Supposedly, in certain venues along t~e 
group's projected twelve·dty schedule, CSN&Y will 
share the bill with ..... "the Band." 

The re-formt>d Electric nag, still with no firm label 
commitment , spent the past week in San I-rancisco 
rehearSing material for their next album. And ... . 
COinciding with the release of his latest album " Walking 
Man," james Taylor begin a 22-city college and concert 
hall tour April 30. This time out his back-up band 
features David Spinozza and Hugh McCracken, guitars; 
Don Grolnick, piano ; Andy Muson, bass; and Rick 
Marotta, drums. 

A documentarv entitled " ~Iton john and Bernie 
Taupin Say Goodbye to orma jean and Other Things" 
will be televised May 17 at 11 :30 p .m . by ABC-TV . The 
Bryon r orbes produced film was first televi sed over BSC 
Idst fall. 

And , lust in case you haven'l heard 
"Cal ifornia jam," that day-long outdoor concert held 

at Ontario Motor Speedway on April 0, ha officially 
become the most financially successful rock concert in 
history . The event drew over 175,000 people and 
grossed nearly $2 million for its promoters, ABC ~n­
lertainment . The previous box-Qrfice high was the $1 5 
million gross by promoters of last year's Watkin Glen-
"Summer jam." 

And lastly, Mike Oldfield is set to make his national 
television debut on the pre-taped May 11 segment of 
"Don Kirshner 's Rock Concert ." The show features 
Oldfield performing h is lengthy composition, "Tubular 
Hells, " on which he plays more than fifteen different 
Instruments . 

The Evolution or COlUies 
With today 's problems and 

pressures, more and more people 
are turning to comics for en-
tertainment and diversion. Comics 
provide a link With the past , a time 
when one's problems were small 
and life was generally un-
complicated. 

Early comic book pion were 
simple, but with the increasing 
awareness of the average in-
dividual. and the complexity of 
today's life-style, comics have 
become more philosophical and 
relevant to the times. 

The last decade's gift to fandom 
was the resurrection of the 
costu m ed .uper-hero who 
originally faded into obscurity 
during the early 1950's to make way 
for the horror comics. It should be 
pointed out here that the majority 
of comic book readers are children, 
and it is their decision, basically, 
that spells success or failure for a 
comic. The change from super-hero 
to hdrror comics couldn't have 
been made without the acceptance 
of the children. 

The same holds true for the other 
trends that comics have been 
through . Publi hers of comics, like 

by Blake Shira 

politicians, must judge the public's 
mood before commitlng them-
selves. Although the children are a 
major influence on comicdom, 
they, too, are subject to the in-
fluence of pressure groups 
specifically parents. How many 
people, wh ile in their youth, have 
been told by their parents that 
comics were for the illiterate? - and 
if still reading them in later years 
were humiliated in ()ne way or 
another? The comic co llector 
learns to put up with humbling 
himself in public in order to buy 
the new issues of his favorite titles . 

A good example of parental 
di sgust was the E C. comics of the 
1950'.s. They were the company 
which initiated the horror comics 
that were soon imitated by many 
others . The stories were extremely 
gory and dealt with death and 
violence, but every story had the 
peculiar twist-ending that made 
them so popular. 

In 1954, parents became con-
cerned over what their children 
were reading. They launched a 
"movement" which was joined by 
psychologists and the U.S. Senate. 
One famous p ychologist, Dr. 

Frederic Wertham, in his book 
Seduction of the Innocent attacked 
comics by stating that they " burnt- • 
out the mental tastebuds" of young 
chi Idren so that they were unable 
to appreciate the subtler tones of 
more acceptable literature. 

E.C. attempted to remain in 
business during this official on-
slaught by producing new titles, 
specifically the "New Direction" 
comics. These retained the same 
outstanding artwork but com-
promised on their story content . 
Subjects such as piracy, King 
Arthur 's Court , psycho-analysis and 
the medical profession were ex-
plored . All of these, however, 
lacked someth ing that the older 
stories had: the writers had tried to 
maintain their famous twist -
ending, but the new ones failed to 
shock their readers . Even their 
p-ride and joy of this period, " In-
credible Science Fiction," was duly 
hampered by the Comics Code 
Authority . 

E. C. comics finally went under 
in late 1955. The only survivor was 
MAD, which changed from a comic 
book to a magazine with issue 
number 24 . So great was th.e 

broad range of ' interests,

Christmas-With Strings Attached 
About a year ago Eric Christmas, 

Theatre Director at the University of 
California, San Diego, heard a 
remarkable musical group playing a 
concert he found electrifying. Mr. 
Christmas believes that this is one of the 
most exciting ensembles of profeSSional 
calibre to be heard In Southern 
Californ ia, and that it should be shared 
with the UCSD community . Con-
sequently, a special concert is being 
presented this Thursday, May 2, in the 
UCSD Theatre at 8 .00 p.m" at which 
Christmas will, in a light-hearted vein, be 
Master of Ceremonies for "Christmas --
With Strings Attached ." 

The group being presented are young 
people ranging from the ages of 4 to 14 
under the tutelage of Mr Margarito 
Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez has achieved 
remarkable results with students of string 
instruments by use of the Suzuki violin' 
method This method, which Dr. Suzuki 
calls the "Mother Tongue" method, relies 
heavily upon the young child's ability to 
absorb differences in sounds. The old 
methods were based primarily upon a 
mastery of physical techniques and note 
reading . Dr. Suzuki's method is based 
upon the co ncept that young, 
discriminating ears will find their way 
musically as they do with the spoken 
language. It is only after a period of 

batiks. 

training the ears that they then begin to 
read mUSIc and to Int rpret what th y ~ee 
on a printed page, similar to the way In 
which children first learn to speak by 
Imitation . and later learn to read thE' 
printed word 

One of the thrilling a pects of tht> 
ensemble is the very positive, optlml ~ tl c 
nature they exude l3ecause they have 
learned to hear the differences between 
tones, they also learn to plav With " t> r~ 
precise intonation . and be( a u~e th!'\ drl' 
not primarily concE'rnpd Wi th lhl'

minister, taught hiS children musIC Upon 
leaving his home In TampICO, ME'xl(o.

from the ational Conservatory In 
Mexico City. He graduated ,\ Ith a 
Bachelor 's Degree from I fl e n d'~ 
University '" Kansas and With a Master s 
Degree from the University of Kan as 
The majority of students in the ensemble 
have had their entire musical education 
under his tutelage.

Tricycle Racers 
Make Big Splash 

by Tracy Bertolucci 

Saturday afternoon the (Jowds on Muir Commons 
were gathered to view the first annual UCSD trike races. 
These consisted of eleven heats with finals around a 
very hairy obstacle course. 

The trikers started off at the signal of a water pi tol to 
first tackle the slalom. After crossing a street. these brave 
ouls were taken through a sand pit and water obstacle. 

Halfway through the course, the riders and the pusher 
traded positions and coasted down .a hill into a hay 
stack. From there they triked around Muir Commons, 
past the Five & Dime, over two wooden ramps and 
finally to the finish line. 

This relatively easy course proved to be the grounds 
upon which 44 teams literally demolished 9 dozen 
tricycles . -The vehicles in the final s possessed few of 
their original parts, due toa couple of crafty mechani

Mike Duran & Rick Ragsdale 
Tim San kay & Don Strebel 

Lon Burford & Bruce Lazarus 
Mark Olson & Bruce Matzner 
Hank Webster & Mitch Canak 

Bill Zorn & Jeff Sieder 

The finalists were put to even harder test in the 
crucia l race of the day . Even though the a tual course 
was shorter, it entai led more rigorous obstacles . These 
sta lwart fellows had to stop at the "pi t stop", sit on the 
ant ique toi lets provided and each down one chocolate 
cream pie, without the aid of their hands. Then, the 
home ~etch was flavored with a little horse manure, 
and, of course, the spectators atop Tioga Hall did their 
best to drench. the contestants with water balloons . 

Dick Duncan & Dave Geshwend placed fourth . Mark 
Olson & Bruce Matzn r placed third, Tim Sankay & Don 
Strebel placed second, and Lon Burford & Bruce Lazarus 
took first with a spectacular time of 1:48. The victorious 
duo were awarded flowers , champagne and kisses from 
a lovely PSA stewardess along with four tickets to the 
Dave Mason concert in May.

Obscure Sports Dept. 

Golfers Bogeying 
by Kirl Robinson 

In what is now becoming So far this year John 
a biweekly column the Janone and Mike Wydra, 
Obscure Sports Dept. once last years NAIA District III 
again returns after another champion, have lead the 
well deserved vacation . As Triton Golfers. The team, at 
a result the OSD staff will the time Patrick was 
b discussing a vacation contacted, has a match play 
sport that i s also included in record of 3-6. 
th UCSD intercollegiate 
program, golf. 

Unfortunately not all of 
the teams at UCSD win all 
the games, matches, meets 
that they compete in . In 
fact some teams aren 't too 
successful at all, lOSi ng 
more games, matches, 
meets than they actually 
win . One such team here at 
UCSD is the Golf team 

In talking to Coach Pat 
Patrtck I found out that the 
Triton golf \quad has a 
(ouplt' of (' (('lIent golfer~, 
but lack~ tht' depth th~t I~ 
n(' t'~~ary to wtn mat he, 
on t.I (onSI\t('nt basis 

The team plays all of its 
home matches at the Camp 
Pendleton Golf Course . In a 
given match there are 
several singles matches as 
well as a couple team best 
ball matches. All matches 
are played over 16 holes 
and are played on the 
match play principle, not 
total score of the team . 

Patrick is presently 
looking to next season, as 
his two top golfers. Janone 
and Wydra , will be 
rC'turn Ing . Patrtck also has 
sC'vpral top transfer ~tudents 
coming to UCSD next year 
that \hould strpngthen the
