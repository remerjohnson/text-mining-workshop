Illnesses May Not 
Be Food Poisoning 
PHILADELPHIA, Penn . -
When more than 80 
University of Pennsylvania 
students came down with a 
mysterious illness last week, 
the students said they blamed 
the cafeteria f cd while 
administrators blamed an 
inl1uenza-like virus. 
Preliminary results from labo-
ratory tests of stool samples 
from the sick students turned 
up no evidence of bacterial 
contamination. However, 
these results do not conclu-
sively eliminate the possibility 
of food poisoning. Doctors at 
Student Health said that sever-
al more students came in over 
the weekend reponing similar 
symptoms of nausea. vomi t-
ing, diarrhea and fevers.

Faculty Member 
Under Investigation 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. -
Professor of Geology and 
Geophysics Antonio Lasaga, a 
former Yale Residence Hall 
Master. resigned suddenly 
from his position last Friday 
and is now the subject of a 
federal child-pornography 
investigation, television sta-
tion WFSB-TV reported on 
Tuesday. When the FBI 
searched Lasaga's room, they 
found several pornographic 
pictures of chi ldren and two 
computers that were used to 
download, store and print 
chi ld pornography. La~aga is 
also a rnember of Yale's 
tenured faculty. On suflicient 
moral grounds, Yale could 
revoke his tenure in a univer-
sity tribunal. However, Yale 
Provost Alison Richards said 
this process is rare and that 
there are no discussions about 
invoking it at this time. No 
criminal charges had been 
filed as of Tuesday evening.

Police Sweep 
Campus for 
Old Bicycles 
TA~GING: UCSD Bike Shop 
manager ay unused bike 
take valuable rack space 
By Jacob Schechter 
Staff Writer 

Parking ervices, working with the UC 
San Diego Police Department, tagged 150 
abandoned bikes f r removal throughout 
campus during a bike sweep yesterday. 
Parking Services and the Poli ce Department 
will return nex t Wednesday and take away 
all the tagged bikes that are still left. 

"This is the first time thi s has been done 
ror a couple or years, but we just wanted to 
help ou l and fi x Ihis imporlanl problem," 
Officer AI Jenkins said. 

Jenkins said that they had an easy time 
finding the bikes to tag. 

"There's probably 400 or so abandoned 
bikes on campus, but our storage is limited 
so we could only tag tht: 150 worst ones," 
Jenkins said. "We even found them so 
quickly that we didn ' t get to all the areas or 
campus that we had origi nally planned." 

UCSD Bike Shop Manager Dan Rock 
said that the sweep is necessary because the 
old and unu 'ed bikes take up valuable bike 
rack space. 

"Abandoned bikes arc probably taking 
up hundreds of bicycle parking pots," Rock 
said. "So many of them have just deteriorat · 
ed over time and are now just garbage. So [ 
don't think that IParking Services and the 
U SD Poli ce] arc trying to cause a I t of 
problems, [ just think that they're trying to 
clean up the campus." 

Rock sa id that owner graduation from 
college may be the cause of some of the 
unwanted bikes parked around campu~. 

"A lot of times kids graduate, and then 
they feel thei r bikes aren' t worth anything to 
them," Rock said. "They feel it's not worth

Construction Generates Complaints 
MUIR: Building of 
phone receptor generates 
irritates students 
KI-Mln Sung 
Senior Staff Writer 

Due to the high levels of noise 
that construction companies creat· 
ed while building wireless commu-
nication ite on top of Muir ' 
Tioga Residence Hall, ninth· and 
10th-noor Resident Advisor Sean 
Edgett and Erica Hannickel fi led a 
letter of complaint on Oct. 30 on 
behalf of their fioor residents to 
Hou iog and Dining Service . 

To increase the quality of cellu-
lar reception, four wireless campa· 
nie - Pacific Bell Mobi le 
Sy ·tems, GTE Mobi lnet, Nextel 
and Cox California P S - set out 
to build their receptor sites on the 
II -story Tioga Hall. After negotia-
tions that spanned four years, cun· 
struction began in August and will 
continue until the end of this month. 

The drilling that led to com-
plaint from the resident advisors 
stopped approximately two weeks 
ago. Currently, con truction work-
er are fini hing the project by 
working on the wiring for the 
receptor . The wiring has :lot creat· 

ed the noise that drew the origi nal 
compl ai nts. 

Director of Housing and Dining 
Services Larry Barrett said that the 
disruption that initially occurred at 
the beginning of the academic year 
was unexpected. 

"We weren' t aware of the fact 
that it would be this di sruptive," he 
saill . 

The letter of complaint present-
ed to Barrett on Oct. 30 stated that 
the noise cau id by drilling and 
hammering wa detrimental to the 
student ' well· being and academic 
performance. In additi n, Edgett 
said construction, which started at 8 

a.m. and continued until 4 p.m., 
caused inconvenience to the tu· 
dents. 

"We had to leave during the day 
or just sit here and become very 
frustrated with them," Edgett said. 
"There were time [when) it was so 
loud that my friend and I couldn't 
even talk in my room." , 

An ther student al 0 said she 
wa bothered by the noi e.

Mushrooms May Fight Cancer The Original 
RESEARCH: Scientists find that toxic compounds could be used as treatment 1-5 and Clairemont Drive 
By Marjorie Montemayor 
Guardian Reporter 

The poisonous jack-o-Iantern 
mushroom may sound unlikely to 
offer any benefit Lo humans, bUI the 
research of two UCSD scienti sts 
has recently revealed that this wild 
fungus could be the next hope in 
the fight against cancer. 

UCSD Professor of Chemistry 
Trevor McMorris. along with 
UCSD Professor of Palhology 
Michael Kelner, has successfully 
conducted promising research on 
the mushroom 's toxic compounds. 

The jack-o-Iantern mushroom. 
named for its yellow-orange color, 
normally grows on rOlling wood. It 
grows in regions of the United 
States, Japan , Canada and Europe. 
This fungus has also been seen in 
areas within San Diego, such as 
Balboa Park . 

McMorris began his studies on 
the jack-o-Iantern mushroom in 
1960 when he joined the New York 
Botanical Garden research slaff. 
Through his studies, McMorris was 
able to determine the chemical 
structure of the mushroom's toxic 
compounds. one of which is 
illudin-S. IIIudin-S is toxic to both 
normal and cancer cells. 

With hi s students, McMorris 
made modifications to illudin-S to 
create new analogs. These mole-
cu les are si mi lar in structure to 
illudin-S , but are less toxic and 
more elective in targeting cancer 
cells. Of the many analogs. hydrox -
ymethylacylfulvene proved 10 
exhibit the best activity. 

Hyd rox y methy I acy I ful vene, 
also referred to as MGI- 114. was 
tested by Kelner in 1990 on "nude 
mice" - mice that lack an immune 
system. Cancerous tumor cells 
were implanted in these mice and 
allowed to grow for a certain peri -
od of time. Results showed that 
when MGI-114 was injected into 
the mice, either a significant halt in 
tumor growth or regression 
occurred. 

Various studies of the drug's 
effect on humans have also taken 
place. Phase I clinical trials for 

"We are making new 
analogs hoping to 
find better antl-can-
cer agents. The 
other big proJect Is 
to find out more 
about the mecha-
nism of action. How 
exactly do these 
compounds act 
when they're Inject· 
ed Into the body? 
It's very satisfying 
to have worked on 
this project and 
actually made a new 
cancer drug right 
here at UCSD. ,y 

- Trevor McMorris 
UCSD Chemistry Professor 

MGI- 114, which began in 1995, 
will be near completion this year. 
The main objective of the Phase I 
trials centers on determining the 
maximum tolerated dose of MGI-
114 that can be administered to 
humans. These investigations have 
resulted in the identification of 
toxic effecls which occur when the 
maximum-tolerated doses are 
exceeded. Some of these effects 
include bone marrow suppression, 
reversible kidney effects, nausea, 
vomiting, phlebitis (venous innam-

mation), fatigue and facial flu~hing . 
In August 1993. MGI Pharma, 

Inc .. a pharmaceutical company 
based in Minneapolis. acquired the 
rights from the University of 
California to all illudin-S analogs. 
which includes hyd roxymcthy la-
cylfulvene. The drug 's name 
change to MGI- 114 came as a 
result of this acquisition. 

MGI Pharma. Inc. is already in 
the process of conducting Phase II 
clinical studies with MGI· 114. In 
addition to the wmpany's efforts, 
the Nalional Cancer Institutc (NCI) 
is taking part in Phase II ~rial s via 
studies regarding co lon cancer and 
non-small cell lung and renal can -
cer. 

NCI is also working in a Phase I 
clinical study pcnaining to pedi -
atric cancer patients. By the end of 
this year, MGI Pharma, Inc. plans 
to cm'ry out additional rcsearch 
relating to the drug 's effcci on 
ovarian and pancreatic cancer. 
Overall. many major cancers will 
be studied in II to 13 cancer cen-
ters nationwide, within a six to 24 
month time frame. 

With MGI Pharma. Inc. and the 
National Cancer Institute conduct -
ing Phase Il trials, McMorris and 
Kelner plan on continuing their 
investigations with the illudin-S 
analogs as well . 

" We arc making new analogs 
hoping 10 find heller anti ·cancer 
agents. " McMorris said. "The olher 
big project is to tlnd out more 
about the mechani sm of action. 
How exactly do these compounds 
act when they' re injecled into the 
body'!" 

The answer to this question and 
the other outcomes or these ~tudies 
will eventually lead to a better 
understanding or Ihe cancer light-
ing agents. For now, though, 
McMorri s said hI! is content wilh 
the wntributions his laboratory has 
made in fueling the elTons toward 
c.:ombating c.:ancer. 

" It 's very satisfying to have 
worked on this project and actually 
made a new cancer drug right here 
at UCSD," McMorris said.

A.S. Handles T.A. Union 
Item With a Swift Hand 

Last week, the A.S. Council approved the remain-
ing item on the University of California Student 
Association 's (UCSA) Advocacy Agenda. This arm 
of the plan dea lt with s upporting the recognition of 
TA unioni zation on UC campuses. 

The council he ld o ut on voti ng on thi s seventh 
agenda item until last week, so that counci l members 
could have time to do more research on the maller. 

The A.S . Council should be commended for its 
handling of this potentially divi sive situation . The 
subject of TA unioniza tion is a sensitive topic to 
many students, graduate s tudents, and professor and 
if the council had not approached the issue with cau-
tion, problems could have resulted that mi ght have 
harmed the counci l for the rest of its administration . 

The counci l members took the appropria te steps 
with thi s situation . By ho lding out on voti ng on the 
subject for a week, they allowed themselves the time 
to get the needed information to cast an educated 
vote. For an issue of thi s significance, it is imponant 
that council members make themselves available to 
students a nd the pertine nt informati on. 

The A.S . Council exerc ised good judgment in 
addressing this topic immediately and swiftl y. It did 
not allow the issue to drag on for weeks and po ' ibly 
divide the council. Dealing with the issue qui klyand 
efficiently allowed the council to move on to othe r 
significanl issues at UCSD.

day of the lockout and (he re is no end in sight. 

The NBA season, which was supposed to start on 
Nov. 3, has been postponed inde finite ly because the 
league and p layers can't agree on how to divide up $2 
bi llion in annual revenues . The players, who received 
57 percent of the revenues last season, are determined 
to receive 60 percent this season. The league, howev-
er, is offering a 50-50 split. 

Frankly, the NBA fans collectively don ' t give a 
damn. To the average fan , the lockout seems petty 
and irrelevant. 

What isn't irrelevant, however, is the players and 
owners neg lecting the fan s, as they proceed with end-
less negotiati ons. We may " love thi s game," but we 
sure don ' t love this bicke ring. It" time for owners 
and players to pur their diffe rences aside for the good 
of the fan s, and starr the season before it's too late.

IMITATION FOODS NEITHER 
HEALTHY NOR NATURAL 

ANALYSIS: 
Vegetable patties, plastic 
cigarettes and fake sugar 
are poor substitutes 
By Shannon Castle 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Sugar-frce l:andy. Olestra. icotine 
inhalers. 

In the grand quest for healthy liv-
ing, the American public has taken 
everything that is good. pure and tasty 
in thi s world and found less-than-ade-
quate substitutes. People arc running 
from fat, sugar, meat, caffeine and 
ak:ohol and into the arms or a bunch of 
chemical concoct.ions. This not only 
makes for a bland existence, void of 
sensual pleasure, but also poses a def-
inite threat to one's health. 

One of the scariest of these "fake" 
pr ducts is also the most overlooked: 
the veggie burger. I'm not talking 
about those grainy "garden burgers" 
that don' t daim 10 taste like. or even 
vaguely resemble. hamburgers. I'm 
talking about products that cla im to 
taste like meat, cook like meat and 
look like meat , but arc instead com-
prised of something called "texturilcd 
vegetable protei n." 

Vegetarians everywhere defend the 
hurg..:r, along wi th the helov..:d "tofu-
dog," as- mon.: natural , and therefore 
hea lthier. than meat. But what exactl y 
is "natu ral?" An animal. alive ( r dead, 
is about as natural as it geb. A veggic 
hurger, on the other hand, contains 
things like "maltndextrin. hcxam-
elaphosPale and natural and artificia l 
m lors." one of thc~c chemica l addi -
lives can he found in the illl ·naturJI, 
all-beef burger. 

Much more · widely abu\ed than 
fake llIeat is fake sugar: sugar-free 
candy and diet soda. II seems t hat peo-
ple want all the bcnelib of ~ugar with-
out any of the l:onsequenl:e~ . They can

o 0 0 0 
It seems that people 
want all the benefits 
of sugar without any 
of the consequences. 
They can satisfy their 
sweet tooth without 
compromising any 
diets. Unfortunately, 
people who take 
advantage of the wide 
range of sugar-free 
products on the 
market are just 
kidding themselves. 
promising any diets. Unfortunately, 
people who take advantage of the wide 
range or ~ugar-free produl:ts on the 
market arc jUM kitlding themselves. 

Do they rea lly reap any benelits? 
Do they re~llly avoid any neg,Hive con-
,eqm; nl:e~ '! On hoth l:ou nts , an 
emphatic " 0." SUlwrks, l:and y docs-
n't lU~tc quite like thl! real thing, and it 

tentl~ to leave an unpleasant afterta~te . 
Diet Dr. Pepper tasles absolutely noth -
ing like regular Dr. Pepper. 

,partalllc, thc chemi l:u l most 
l:olllmonly used in the place of sugar, 
ha not been sh wn to have any harm-

ful side effects, bu t neither has it been 
proven tOlally safe. Saccharin , a 
sweetener used primarily in gum, is 
carcinogenic in lab rats. The rats, how-
ever, show no adverse effects from nat-
urally oCl:urring sugars . 

On the shelf of any trul y health-
conscious American, right alongside 
the sugarless chowlat\:, is a selection 
of fat-free foods. With the advent of 
Oleslra, the fat-that 's-not-rea li y-a-fat, 
even traditionally greasy foods like 
potato chips can be fat-free. 
Unfortunately for the consumer, 
though, Olestra is so new thal no one 
rea lly knows what long-term health 
con equenccs it may have. Many peo-
ple, however, do experience digestive 
problems after eating Olestra products. 
The risks and consequences associated 
with this product outweigh the benefit 
of a few less calories. Stick wi th lhe 
real fat. 

The newest and most expensive of 
the fake products for the hea lLhy w n-
sumcr is the nicotine inhaler. This 
device, marketed as an aid for those 
who are trying to quit smoking, is 
made 10 look and feel like a cigarette. 
The recovering smoker can take nico-
tine- fill ed drags from the inhal er just 
as i I' it were a ciga relle. 

I've been told that the fake cigareltc 
has psycho logical benefits for the 
recovering nicotine addi ~ t , sinl:e it 
feels almost like smoking. Frankly, I 
don't get it. The addict is not on ly try -
ing to break an addil:tion to nicotine, 
hut also the habit of ,moking. Inhaling 
niwtine and pretending to s rnokl: 
won't help either one of these proh-
lems.

however, i)' the final l:ategory of take 

rroduct~ : decalfeinated cortee and

DRESS-UP AND DISPLAY REAL-SIZED WOMEN 
ANALYSIS: 
Magazi nes shun plu -
si ze women and 
encourage them to diet 
By Angie Brunk 
Indiana Dally Student (Indiana U.J 

BLOOMINGTO . Ind . 
"What Ilre you doing ~illing like 
Venus'l You 're turning on all the 
men ." 

I was sitti ng on a wuch in the 
library when a friend of mine 
made that remark . I was sitti ng 
with my back to the room. using 
the back of the coul:h to hold up 
the magazine I was reading and 
givi ng everyone in the room a 
dear view of my vo luptuous bal:k-
side. I found myself responding to 
the comment in a way that still 
amazes me. 

' 'I'm more likely to frighten 
men than turn them on," I said. I 
was quite astonished that I had fall-
en back into an old pattem of self-
deprecation I thought I had aban-
doned sometime during my under-
graduate days. 

I wondered short Iy after if the 
fact that I was reading 
Cosmopolitall at the time was a 
mere coincidence. I didn 't think 
about it much until I rcad an article 
in the November issue of Glalllollr 
that made Ille abso lutely li vid. 
" Why magazines don' t show 
clothes on Illore reltl -sized women" 

wa yet another pathetic attempt to 
justify the l:ontinued use of model> 
who arc all cast from the same 
mold. 

The editors claimed tht:y l:ou ld 
not usc models not tltting the tradi -
tional mold for ~everal reasons. 
They said they rely on designers' 
samples for most of their fa~hion 
layou ts and that those samples arc 
made only in sile 6 or H. They said 
readers think thei r cover designs 
with plus-size models are unattrac-
tive. Fashion is more about fantasy 
than showing average women how 
to look good. The cd itor~ 01 
Glalllour must think their readers 
are idiots. 

If Glamour actually wanted to 
change the fashion press, it has 
enough clout to do so. Designers 
and clothing manufacturers count 
on the main tream fashion maga-
zines to sell their clothes. The edi -
tor could insist that designers pro-
duce garments in various sizes for 
fashion shoots and simply refuse to 
work with designers who will not 
do so. 

Still , the article might have 
retained a shred of credibi lity if a 
plus-size model had been featured 
somewhere in the magazine. Even 
in the unlikely event that the maga-
zi nes l:an' t persuade designers to 
be more reasonable about sample 
ga rment s, magaz ines could still 
feature plus-size women in makeup 
spreads or in many shots that deco-

I do not expect 
fashion magazines 
to abandon their old 
habits overnight, nor 
do I expect to see 
only plus-size 
models in the 
magazines. Thin 
women, as Calista 
Flockhart knows, 
get as much grief as 
large women. 
rate other articles. That thcy do not 
do so says a lot. 

I do not expect fashion maga-
zi nes to abandon their old habits 
overnight, nor do I expcl:t to sec 
only plus-size models in the maga-
l ines. Thin women, as Ca li sta 
Flockhan knows, get as mUl:h grief 
as large women. Fashion maga-

zines shoultl shm women or all 
shapes and s il.c~ , even sitc 2, in 
l:urrent fashions. When I look at 
clothing catalogs, it is to see what 
might look good on me. nm what 
looks good on the rashion indus-
try's ideal of feminine heauty. 

The Gil/Illour editors' l: laim that 
readers of all shapes and siles pre-
ferred the covers featuring thin 
women is laughahle. If they don ' t 
know how to create a tastcl'u I covcr 
featuring larger women. they 
should take lessons from the edi -

IOr~ of Mode and BBW (Big 
Beautiful Woman). The ovember 
cover of Mode featuring Kathy 
Najimy is absolutely beautiful. I 
would much rather see a pi l:ture or 
an attral:t ive woman wearing rea lis-
tic dot hes than a size 6 model 
wcari ng a spandex dress that barcly 
covers her hreasts. 

I know that as a size 16, I will 
always have 10 rely on magazines 
like Mode and BBW for fashion 
layouts in my size. Still , I don't 
think it's too much to ask the main-
stream magazines to use a models 
with ditferent body shapes and 
sizes. They would serve their read-
ers and the designers much more 
e llecti ve ly if they showed 
women's fashions that might al:tu-
ally look good on various body 
types. 

Whcther these editors r~a l ize it 
or not, largc-sizc women m: tually 
do pay attention to our ~ppear-

al1l:cs . Many of the women m my 
rami Iy arc plus sile. We all take 
pride in our appearance and eh 0 'C 
our clOlhes carefUlly. My mother 
and my aunt arc both e pert scam-
stresscs. My aunt mudc several 
heautiful suits. which she recentl~' 
handetl down to me. My mother 
has made onc of my formal dresses 
and the beautiful slate hlue wool 
wat that I wcar. My little sister, 
who is about my sile, is majoring 
in apparel and textile marketing. 
Even though we arc ull very savvy. 
we have a dinicuh time linding 
l: lothes. 

Seeing on ly one type of female 
b dy in the fashion press doesn ' t 
help any of us. My aunt used the 
cont roversial diet drug w mbina-
ti on phen-fen , and my little sister 
went on the allegedly safer of the 
two drugs. Both of them lost 
weight but did not keep it off. I'll 
always wonder how the main-
stream fashion press innuenced 
thei r del:isions to diet. 

I thought I had developed a 
more secure body image and could 
withstand the assaults of the main-
stream fashion press. The maga-
zines arc great nutTy fun and good 
escape reading. That I l:an slip so 
casi Iy back into an old pattern 
means I' m not as strong as I 
thought. Looks as if it's time to 
banish Glalllour and CIISlllopolitall 
from my life until they change their 
attitudes.

A.S. LOSES TOUCH WITH COMMON STUDENT 
Editor: 

I suppon the view made by The 
Ullin Guardian concerning the 
action of the A.S. Counci I. 
Alt hough Pat Ru , in hiS Leller to 
the Editor (" Guardian Exploi ts 
News," GLlardian, Oct. 5, 1998), 
complained that the GLlardian 
neglected to present the positi ve 
accompli hments of the A~soc lated 

Student~ , I muM remind him that 
the negative aspect~ of the counci l 
can be the most telling. Althuugh 

Pre~ ident Clinton has made 
progre\~ while in onice, tiny detaib 
like hb committing perjury while 
under oath do indeed detral.: t from 
his character and hi s accountability 
as pre~ ide nt. Li kewi~o;, the A.S. 

ound l must abo be wi lling to be 
watched under the scrutiniling eye 
of its public. 

While it is undeniahle that 
progress has been made by t h i ~ 
year's A.S. Counci l, I must rei terate 
the fact that I lind it reprehensible 
that members of the Associated 
Students be lieve that they should 
be exempt fro m the day-to-day 
inconve niences of the "common 
student." It shoufd be known lhat 
the Associated Students is receiv-
ing its Soft Reserves products at a 
di scount , AGAJNST the wishes of 
the people who actually work at 
Soft Re erves. Yes, uur elected 
council members demanded that 
they receive A.S. Lecture Notes for 
free and A. S. Soft Reserves prod-
ucts cheaper because they I) own 
the facilities and therefore should 
be able to get their papers for free. 
and 2) work for the students. The 
council members are not gelling, 
say. minutes to A.S. meetings pho-
tocopied for them for free - no -
they are getting notes for their per-
sonal classes. Taking classes at 

UCSD is an academic respunsibili -
ty, not a student body responsibili-
ty: therefore. gelling lecture notes 
and soft re erves for free is beyond 
ludicrous. Even A.S. President Joe 
Leventhal has been quoted in the 
Guardiall as having emphasized 
Ihat the first respon~ ibilit y of A.S. 
ollicers i ~ their role as a sludent 
("A.S. Ollicer Resigns From Post," 
Guurdian, Oct. 22, 1998). 
Additionally. money spenl hy the 
s tudcnt ~ at these f aci liti e~ gO\!~ to 
fund A.S. program~ for th\! \tu-
dcnt~. nOl the ofl i<.:ers, and any 
money thai Soft Re~erve.. or 
Lecture otes loses from paper~ 
given 10 A.S. officers is money that 
is taken away from the students. I 
do not helieve that the arguments of 
the Associated Students for fn!e 
notes b va lid . 

Additionally, the fact that. the 
A.S. offi cers receive "A" parking 
permits has me seeing RED . 
Faculty parking spots are, by de fin-
ition. just that - FACULTY. park-
ing spots. 'Even TAs and GAs, who 
spend an enormous amount of time 
prov iding direct, individual, dai ly 
academic services to students (as 
opposed to the indirect beneli ts we 
receive from A.S. acti vi ty) do not 
receive red permits. Frankly, I think 
that the perks that the A.S. Council 
is receivi ng are in excess and are 
the spoils of power. You guy are 
not gods. I repeal. you guys are not 
gods. You are students, just like the 
rest of us. Until you have to physi -

Records Clerks Help 
Campus Police 
Editor: 

Elea nor Kay 's article titled 
"UCSD Police Release Statistics 
on Crime," (Guardian, Nov. 9, 
1998) was a very well wri tten and 
researched piece on a subjec t 
importan t to the safcty of everyone 
on campus. Hopefu lly the students, 
staff and fac ulty of UCSD now 
have a much better understanding 
of the many diverse resources they 
have in Ihe areas of campus securi-
ty. crime prevention and safety 
awareness. 

It wasn't unti l after 1 was inter-
viewed that I realized J had forgot-
ten to mention a group of individu-
als without whom the Crime 
Statis tic Report would even be 
possible: the UCSD Police 
Department 's Records Diyision. 
Staffed by two UCS D students, 
Lauren Carr and Marissa Guidolin, 
and their supervisor, Records 
Manager Mary Cabandi ng, the 
Records Division is re ponsible for 

compili ng all of the cri me stat ist ic ~ 
from the actual case reports wri tten 
by tlie officers. 

On top of this humongous task. 
the records clerks are also responsi-
ble for the department's "Lost & 
Found" and fingerpri nti ng duties. 
Above all else, these very hard-
working and dedicated employees 
hould get the recognition they 

deserve for the exce llent work that 
they do and the services that they 
provide to thc UCSD I;ommunity. 
It 's important for everyone to rea l-
ize that whi le police officer~, RSO, 
and CSOs provide a vi~ible and 
uni formed front aga inst crime in 
the fie ld . there arc equally impor-
tant people working just as hard

beer for its alcohol. Take away the 
caffeine and the alcohol, and you're

"However, lJ minou, changes

What a patho" what a draillatic

OK. enoughjnkcs. 1 don ' t want 
to refuse anybody the right to feel 
proud of his or her own armed 

fo rces. If that is the aspect of your 
country t hat makes you proud, so 
be il. But I am quite sad, seeing an 
article so empty of content and 
fu ll of cheap emotional and propa-
gandistic undertones. Armet!

empty fanfare to militari sm and to 
a quite empty notion of indepen-

more rrofound historica l wrrenh

courtesy of 20th Century Fox 
Washington: Agent Hub, (Denzel Washington) , squares off with General Devereaux, 
(Bruce Willis) in the controversial action adventure, "The Siege ." 

PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM 
(The Siege ' poorly addresses its controversial issues 

By Dave Yen 
Guardian Reporter 

There is a touching moment halfway 
through "The Siege," when Dcnzel Washing-
ton 's charal:ter. Hub, is making a speech in 
from of fellow agents fol -
lowing a terrorist bomb-
ing. As he cundemns the 
vi ll ains and their actions, 
his nose starts to bleed and 
the blood drips to the noor. 
But Hub does not relent. His fierce detcrmi -
nation and quest for justice only lead him to 
become angrier and more excited about the 
prospect of nailing these monsters. All in all , 
it was a moving scene - too bad it was one 
of the only such scenes in the film . 

Movie-goers nowadays often compluin of 
the lack of quality lilms that provide a mean -
ingful message. Instcad , they uffer through 
mindless, "shoot-em-up, action bloodfests" 
that propel the audience through one special 
effeets sequence after another. "The Siege" 
definitely appears as one of thc former, a 
complicated melodrama that deals with the 
contemporary issue of individual liberties vs. 
the best interests of a nation. 

Maybe it sounds good on the surface. but 
whilc the lilm makes a valiant a!tempt to 
explore complex issues and move audicn t:cs, 
the result is a befuddled ll1 e~s full of typical 
Hollywood c1it:hcs and forced sYlllpathy. Per-
haps it wou Id have been beller to make an 
action lilm Ollt of Ihi~ "Sit.:ge ." 

When Arah terrorists blow up a busloatl of 
people in New York City. federal agent Hub 
tea ms up with a mysterious CIA agent 
(Annelle Bening) to investigate the heinou~ 
act and swif'tly bring the perpetrator~ to jus-
tice. Things heat lip 'ubstantially when anoth -
er bombing is committed. and then another. 
With the death toll ris ing and the citizens of 
New York in a panic, the president takes dec i-
sive action, imposing a statc of martial law on 
the city. 

Under the command of the intimidating 
Genera l Devereaux, portrayed keenly by 
Bruce Willis. the army takes over the t:ity and 
herds Arab Americans into inspection and 
contai nment camps, reminiscent of the Japan-
ese intemment camps of World War II. Their . 
mission : to lind the enemies - at all costs. 
But has thi s search gone too far? Does one 
have to become a monster to catch one') 

There are three problems with this film, 
the foremost of which is it s lacks of character 
development and intelligent interaction . 
WashinglOn and Bening never click. They 
play the typical bil:kering profo: ssionals 

thrown toge ther under 
unll ~ ual circumstances. At 
lirst , th cy light and threaten 
each other. As the lilm pro-
gresses, they actually start to 
like each other (ncv(!r saw 

. that one coming). 
Washington 's character is intcresting, but 

is vi rtually the same roll: he portrayed in 
"Crimson Tide" and "Courage Under Fire." 
He's the moral , law-abiding good Samaritan, 
who cha ll enges au thority and gives long 
speeches about justice. freedom and the pur-
suit of the truth (i .e. Patrick Henry's "Give 
me liberty or give me death!"). Willis is 
elTective as a hard-line general who has his 
own agenda, but the role is so underwriuen 
that his talents arc mostly wasted. He just 
struts around with a mean look on his face. 
Bening 's performance is not even worth di s-
cllssing. 

The lilm 's second probl em is lack of a ' 
cohesive scrip!. In the heg inning, the pacing 
of the tilm is sharp and fast; scene, fly hy. 
depicting people constantly on the mo ve. 
Once Bening and Washington join forces, 
howeve r. the pacing fall s apart. Investi gation 
and deliberation ~I:enc~ drag on, a, do I:on-
tri ved convcrsatiom IImt con,i, t lIIainly of 
one person saying, "you can ' t Jo thi ~." und 
another say ing. "yes, I can ." 

The third and linal prohlel1l 01 thl! Ii 1111 i, 
the incorporation of elellll.:nts typical to any 
terroris t film . T(.!rrori~ts bomb huilding. 
agents react. terrorists e~pou~e views about 
their struggle for indepe ndence and dignity. 
agents display sy mpathy. and in the end, 
agents blow away terrorists and everyone is 
happy (except the terrori sts, of course). 

If the point of' "The Siege" is to show 
how individual liberties call he ~lIrpressed 
during times of c ri sis , forget it, we already 
know it. If the point is to demon,tratc the 
government 's capabilities for a quick and 
calcu lated re ponse to crisis , we know that 
LOO. Jf, however, the point is to provide audi -
ences with two hours of suspense- filled 
entertainment, the film succeeds on some 
leve ls.

Comet: "Lloyd " is one of the feature films in "Spike and Mike 's 
Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation ." 
This co mputer animat ed film 
stars onl y Lewinsky an d a 

banana , though 
much can be 
inferred . Robert s 
c laims that thi s 
piece plays 
homage to Andy 

Warhol's short. ex perimental film 
"Mario Banana." Interestingly, it 
was made before Clinton's admis· 
sion. 

Of spec ial note are two classic 
cult features from Mall Stone and 
Trey Parker, the nea tors of South 
Park . "Frosty," the first rare ly 
see n episode, is bad ly dubbed but 
wonderfu ll y sacrilegious. All fans 
can see Kenny ki lled for the firsl 
time by a vicious snowman . And 
the uncensored ve rsion of "The 
Spirit of Chri stmas," in 35 mm , 
brings the infamous duel between 
Jesus and Santa Clau ' to the bi g 
,cn:cn. Be prepared for blood-

~tained snow and a rowd y audi -
ence. 

True, th ird·grade humor is liber-
ating , hut not all of the ti lms are 
funny. Steven Fonti 's "Sick and 
Twisted Special Games" is a paro-

dy of handicapped children thai 
c~ossed the line of sarcasm and left 
the audience silent. We all know 
that little boys with no arms or legs 
can' t play basketball, and that see· 
ing-eye dogs can probably run a 
race faster than their owners. But 
the timing of the jokes was slower 
than the charaC lers. 

Despite their occasional degen· 
erate an, Spike and Mike have 
exposed otherwi se ignored anima· 
tion without the help of corporate 
sponso rship for over 20 years. 
"Beavis and BUllhead" and "Wal · 
lace and Gromit" made their Amer-
ican debuts with the help of Spike 
and Mike. They si ngle-handedly 
keep the world of animated anarchy 
alive. 

The festival is held at The

GHOST: 
Clowes captures true 
human character 
Contlnu_ from INIge 9 
that is wrong with alternative 
comics: the narrative is a pseudo· 
story where nothing ever actually 
happens and most of the action is 
told in flashbacks, the characters 
are irritating when they aren' t mak · 
ing the reader cringe by hitting to 
close to home, the panel layouts are 
consistently three tiers of panels 
stacked on top of each other (a 
design that has remained 
unchanged since before World War 
II) and the characters are rendered 
sickly without any sense of motion. 

The difference between Chost 
World and most alternative comics 
is that Clowes manages to pull it 
off bri lIiantly. 

Chost World is an 80-page 
nove ll a (originally seriali zed in 
Clowes' long running series Eight-

ball) that tells the Story of twO 
friends who recently graduated 
from high school. The story opens 
with Enid and Rebecca watching 
TV, idolizing kitsch pop-culture 
ephemera, making fun of everyone 
different from them and complain· 
ing that everyone makes fun of 
them for being different. 

The first half of Ghost World is a 
series of barely connected episodes, 
in which Enid and Rebecca go to 
restaurants, follow a couple they 
think are Satani ts, make crank 
phone calls. talk about sex, and do 
whatever 18-year·old self-described 
"hipsters" do in whateve r town they 
live. The town itself is fascinating; il 
has many elemems of a big city -
porn shops, homelessness. weirdos 
in diners - but nothing fun for the 
characters to do. Even when Clowes 
shows a passerby or two. there i ' an 
eerie loneliness to the city. 

The "Ghost World" of the tit le 
seems to refer to thi s phenomenon, 
though in the comic it 's a direcl ref·

erence to graffiti written all over 
the town . At lirst the reader isn ' t 
sure that the gramti is even "real" 
in the context of t he story, but even· 
tually the graftitist himse lf is seen. 
The title plays on the idea of a 
"ghost town,'" and this theme of 
abandonment becomes central to 
the narralive's second half. 

It is in the second half of Ghost 
World that the story itself takes 
shape. Enid, it lurns out, might be 
goi ng to eo liege - a facl she has-
n't told Rebecca. 

The charat:ters' motivations are 
as hidden from the reader as they 
are from each ot her - and from 
themselves. They act naturally, but 
the reader isn' t given any insight to 
their Ihoughts. other than through 
actions and words that rare ly lit 
together. The charactt!rs li e to each 
other. to themse lves and to the 
reader; Clowes ex pertly uses these 
lies to show Ihe ambiguity of life 
on the cdge of adulthood. 

Clowes' drawings are slick and 

ca refull y construcled. The face of 
each passerby is a hideous carica-
ture; every physical defect becomes 
monumental, just as the main char-
acters see them. Enid and Rebecca 
themselves. while not exactly 
supermodels, don't suffer the same 
fate . This depiction ties in with the 
story, as each constantly accuses 
the other of being more attractive. 

Clowes' paci ng is <llso well 
done. Cuts between scenes occur 
unexpectedly, hut not confusingly. 

ilenl panels are well used. But 
here lies Clowes' biggest fault : 
aside from surface details like the 
ugly faces, there is nothing here that 
couldn't have been done just as well 
in another medium. The film ve r· 
sion of thi s (;Quid be as well paced 
and have as good a script; there i. 
nothing about the pages themselves 
th,ll is inherently comics. 

The book rcads more like a 
novel. down to the three-tier layo ut. 
The reader reads left 10 right . down 
a tier and repeal. shIrt again on the 

HIATUS 13 

next page. This might seem obvi-
ous - ye , that is how we read -
but the fact is that thi s layout 
requires Ihe reader to pretend he or 
she can't see the next panel, or the 
next page. Surprises can occur in 
novels because it ' easy to not read 
words on the right-hand page when 
one is reading on the left ·hand side. 
In comics, though, it 's nearly 
impossible to not see a picture on 
the right. 

Comics, especially alternative 
comi cs, have ignored this fact for 
decades. For comics to truly break 
out as their own anistic medium, 
creators muSI take inlo aC(;Qul1l the 
physical considerations of comics 
themselves. not bury their heads in 
the sand and make comics that 
emulate other, more respected, 
media. 

These hard·core comics theory 
ravings aside, Ghost World is a bril · 
liant and insightful work by one of 
the 1110st talented and important 
arti sts working in any medium.

TIGHT LEATHER PANTS AND TATTOOS 
(Velvet Goldmine ) delves into the rise and fall of glam rock ) 

By Jenna Barclay 
Guardian Reporter 

"Velvet Goldmi ne" is as sump-
tuous and extravagant as the ti tle 
suggests. The fi lm traces the evolu· 
tion and dClnlse of "glam rock," 
giving the viewer nashbacks of the 
carly '70s. 

Memorable sounds and My les 
fill the movie's twisted, chaotic 
puth - p,linting a vcry striking 
and palpable portrait of the 
dc(;ade'~ carly rock ~ce ne for even 
the mo~t . unknowlcdgeable of 
viewers. In a ~ense, "Velvct Gold-
mine" seems to be more of a trib-
ute to the short-lived era rather 
than an actual story. Evcn so, it is 
certainly a cu ltural document that 
stands alone. 

' 'Velvet Goldminc" was writtcn 
and directed by Todd Haynes. 
Glum rock as a subjc(;t for a movie 
is a relative ly new one. The era 
itself is often understated and for-
gotten. As a result, Haynes nur-
tured the idea and production of the 
movie for some ti me. He spent 
many months researching the sub-
ject and selecting actors for the 
ro les. Finally. he settled on the very 
apt cast of Jonathan Rhys Meyers 
("The Guverness"). Ewan McGreg-
gor ("Trai nspott ing"), Toni Collelle 
("Muri al's Weddi ng") and Christ-
ian Bale ("Little Women"). The 

Cour tesy of Miramax 
Izz.d: Edd ie Izzard (above) brings back the "retro " fashion of the early '70s in Todd Haynes' 
portraya l of the "glam rock" period in "Ve lvet Goldmine." 

The film embraces numerou~ 
genres. It is a love story, a musical , 
a th ri ller and foremost a period 

fi lming took 
place over nine 
weeks on loca-
tion in London 
during the spring 
of 1997. 

Ie -mOYie = . e'view 
ex tr avaganza 
that plunges into 
the thick of 
'ga lam Roa k' 
(English accent) 

The film 's principle sClling is in 
a vivacious-looking London in the 
early '70s. Intermittently, the story 
hops over to a semi -lictional mid-
'80s New York - bleak and 
Orwellian. Reporter Arthur Stuart 
(Bale) journeys back into the past 
on an assignment to unfold the 
murder myslCry of "Glam God" 
Brian Slade (Rhys). 

While following Slade's ri e to 
·tardom and his complicated rela-
tionships with his wife, Mandy 
(Collette). and hi s American inspi-
ration, Curt Wild (McGreggor), 
Stuart seems to revisit hi s own 
youthful days as a star-struck fan 
on the fringes of the glam scenc. As 
the story progresses, the paths of 
the four characters inextricably 
intertwine.

ish pastel bubble letters in the 
opening credi ts immediately hau l 
the viewer off into the arti licial 
world of superflu ous makeup. body 
glitter, paten leather boots and plat-
form shoes. It is world where any-
thing fli es: drugs, homosexuality, 
deception, immodesty and exorbi-
tance. 

Off course. "Velvet Goldmine" 
is a visual feast as well . Not only 
is the audience exposed to the 
retro age of the late '80s, they are 
see ing a future projected from the 
'70s, an "Orwellian vision" rather 
than the actual decade that has 
already passed. Therefore. the cos-
tumes of "Velvet Gold mine" 
brings about a sy nthesis of early 
'70s and "projected" '80s fas hion.

The setting of "Velvet Gold-
mine" continuall y changes, bound-
ing from the opu lence of the 17th-
century aristocracy, to the glamour 
of Holl ywood in the '30s and '40s 
and on into the forebodingly deco-
rated prophecies of a futurist ic 
society. The ever-changing scenery 
embodies the spirit or the era: the 
constant reinvention of one's self. 
Each scene presents a sort of per-
verted version of history. 

Sladc's li fes tyle is fill ed with 
aris tocrati c furniture and clothes, 
and hi relati onships are almost 
reminiscent of Late Antiquity -
complete with a set of advisors, a 
wife and an array of conso rts and 
concubines. The viewer is left 
with a sense of the absurdity of 
societal norms and conventions. 
The hedonism and artificiality of 
the glam era see ms almost legit-

The film uses historical poetry 
as a sort of sub-narrati ve. The prose 
reveals glam roc k as more than just

a froth y feast, but as an actu al 
movement that wa nted to a.:hi eve 
something - to communicate to 
the world the way it 's poetic prede-
cessors did . The glam culture itself, 
as port rayed by the movie, appears 
to be a reaction to hi story, society 
and basic entertainment norms as 
we know them. 

The characters are as rich and 
ornate as the film 's visuals and 
sounds. Each role reveals a differ-
ent facet of the era - be it the 
fringes of the glam rock scene or 
the very heart of it. £t is an incredi -
bly deep movie. Its creat ivity and 
inventiveness hark back to the sur-
realism and fanta sy of "Clockwork 
Orange," "Cabaret," and "Willy 
Wonka." 

Nevertheless. the casual movie-
goer should not be delerred by the 
film 's weighty complexities and 
retlection. The surface is very fun 
and froth y with it 's outrageous 
scenery, costumes, and music. This 
movie is recommended to most 
audiences. Howevcr, the kiddi es 
and the weak at heart should prob-
ably Slay at home for this one.

***** 
For those readers with the ten-

dency to play an album until they are 
so sick of it they never want to hear 
it agai n - look into getting your 
hands on a copy or the new 764-
Hero Album. , have been listeni ng to 
this alhum incessanlly ror thc past 
Ihree weeks and' am still not tired 
of it. In fact , thc more Gel Here and 
Sta)' is played, the better it gcts. 

This appeal is due moslly to the 
addition or bass player James 
Bcnram, who adds a fullness of 
sound that the band lacked until now. 
On Get Here alld Stay, the band goes 
from a cute, two-member pop band to 
a mature, three-piece group that has 
the industry buzzing. 

On Ihe second full length album, 
the Scallic band's vocalist John Atkins 
sings about a variety of subjects, such 
as dropping out ("Ottawa Dropout"), 
relationships ("Calendar Pages") and 
running away from home ("Stained 
Glass"). The only downside to this 
alhum, sure to restore li steners' faith in 
rock, is that it isn' t long cnough.

*** 
The popularity of swing has 

intensified in recent years, with the 
introduction or movies such as 
"Swingers" and those clever Gap 
Khakis ads. This resurgence result-
ed in the proliferation of modem 
swing bands, such as the Brian Set-
zer Orchestra and Big Bad Voodoo 
Daddy. Now, the Cigar Store Indi-
ans have released their new CD EI 
BaiLe De La Cobra, and presented 
America with a new offering to lay 
upon thc alter of swing music. 

Rather than being a mediocre 
band intent on jumping on the swing 
bandwagon. this Atlanta, Ga. based 
"dance band" adds its own distinctly 
Southern style to songs such as 
"Tassin' & Turnin'" and "Big Girl 
Blouse." The band's work brings to 
mind such performers as Jell)' Lee 
Lewis and Elvis Presley, and another 
national craze: rock 'n' roll. 

The Cigar Store Indians have a 
good beat and you can dance to them 
(if you'vc mastcred the Lindy Hop), 
but today, you need more than a good 
beat. - Kathryn Swtsher

ICE HOCKEY 
UCSD's ice hockey game apinst Santa 

Clara last Friday did DOt follow the expect-
ed script. The stick-wielders from La Jolla 
went undefeated last year against Santa 
Clara. posting a J-Q.} RCOrd. A blemish 
on that record wu the last thing UCSD 
had in mind. lbose expectations were 
dashed, bowevel, when 
Slinta Clara pulled 
off a 2·' upset at 
the San Diego 
Sports Arena 

UCSD bid a new 
look as it took the 
ice, with Jessica 
Bm making her fllSt 
start in goal Barr per-
formed well between 
the pipes, limiting 
Santa Clara to two 
goals in her two peri-
ods of work. but the 
offense just could not 
provide enough support. 

Derek Stainer relieved Barr in the third 
period, keeping the team in contention 
until the very end. shutting out Santa Clara 
for the rest of the game. Larry Chan's 
goal, with less than a second left, served as 
UCSD's lone goal of the night. 

Tho loss to Santa Clara dropped UCSD 
to Q.3 for the year with two games left this 
quarter. If it is able to sweep those games 
in the Bay Area, the pucksters' still have a 
chance to make it to the postseason.

WOMEN'S 
RUGBY ' 

Women's rugby got rained on 
twice last Sunday. Once by Mother 

NIIUre, once by Occidental. 
Actually, Occidental only 
lpriDtIed on UCSD, but 

once you are wet, it really 
does DOl make a differ-
eJICC by how much. 

On Sunday, not 
only did Mother 

Nature not cooper-
ate as she soaked 
the women's rugby 

squad with her 
relentless downpour, Occidental 

did Dot either, as the opposing squad went 
on to defeat'UCSD, 3-1. 

Thougb UCSD won against Occidental 
last year. thiDgs did not go the way it had 
hoped for on Sunday, making this loss its 
third in a row. 

But Sunday's defeat was not a com-
plete loss. The squad, with its predominant 
contingent of freshmen and rookies, 
noticed substantial improvement. 

"Our overall team performance 
improved," Staphanie Coogler said. 'There 
was some strong rocking and mauling. The 
forwards were great at doing crash plays ." 

The rugby squad will have an opportu-
nify 10 put this new-found improvemenllO 
test when it hosts its annual women' rugby 
tournament this Saturday and Sunday at 
Warren West field The squad will also get 
a chance to avenge previous losses as it will 
play not only Occidental, but also Stanford 
and CJairemont - squads that beat UCSD 
earlier this season.

he hopes will instill swecping changes in 
ycars to come. 

In hi s quest for Triton support, G rdon is 
attempiing to creale a greater involvement 
with UCSD athletics and the local businesses 
and community. While a game with over 600 
screaming fans might be fun , imagine that 
scene with 8.000 crazed Tritons fans . 

If this ever happens at UCSD. Gordon said 
that it wi ll rely heavily on student interest and 
participation both now and in the fu ture. 

"The program is in its infancy right now 
and we need a core group of student that wi ll 
help make thi vision a reality," Gordon said. 
"With the interest and effort of the student 
body. I be lieve in five yea rs, we can have a 
level of support here that is unlike anyth ing 
thi s university has seen before." 

Onc of the Iir'lthings the program needs

Rec Gym Hosts Floor Hockey PlayoHs 
Another chapter in the long and storied history of the Rec Gym will be written 

over the next week. The '98 Coed Floor Hockey Ptayoffs get under way tonight 
with Coed A and Coed AAA. By next Wednesday nighl the Rec Gym will have 
~ 1_ claimed a couple dozen teams and the strong will have survived to go into the

Coed AAA gets under way tonight and continues on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and finish on Wednesday. 

That's a tot of hockey. Winning by way of the losers bracket won't be easy, but the champions probably won'l 
have to go that route. PUUUUUCKI has only been challenged by Mr. BtGGLESWORTH In league play. They 
can get goats from many diflerent sources including 'The Human Siapshot' Leigh Hsu. He's been clocked at 
about 100 MPH and goalies start sweating when they see him walk In the Ree Gym door. Med School hasn'l 
slowed Raj Patel and his SLICK STICKS should get to the finals as wetl. Look for Deb Finucane to be the 
difference in the championship game and put PUUUUUCK! over the lop lor '98. 

The most competitive levet of play wllllikety be the Coed AA. The teams in this division aillinished lirst or 
second In their league to advance up into intermediale play. The top two seeds HANSON BROTHERS and 
TOP SHELF look to be the class of the field , but don't count out ASPHYXIATORS. They choked out a Sunday 
night league thatlell apart hall way through the season. The question though is can they get more scoring out 
01 their number I line? BONESTORM tost to the top seed by onty 1 and Heten Mitchell can light the lantern. 
Combine that with stingy defense and you may have a winning comba. 

It's easy to fIgure out the Coed A division. There Is no doubt about III EXTRA CRISPY CHICKEN williry

W. Soccer: History 
in the Making 

It 's time for a hi tory lesson. 
Our three-time defending 

National Champion women 's 
soccer squad was ranked o. 2 
in the nation going into this 
year's NCAA Division III 
National Championship tourna-
ment and it wa hosting the 
West Regionals. Its first oppo-
nent: unranked College of St. 
Benedict from Minnesota. 

On paper it was a UCSD 
blowout. On the tield it was pos-
sibly the biggest upset in 
women's collegiate soccer histo-
ry, with St. Benedict 's defeating 
the Tritons on a Iluke goal, 1-0. 

eedless to say. it was one of 
the most painful nights in years 
for U SD. Even more needless 
to say, a lot of tears were flow-
ing on UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus' sideline. 

But none came from the eyes 
of the Triton soccer guru. o. 
McManus calmly addressed hi s 
players. congratulated them on a 
fine season. and strode off the 
field with a strange smirk on hi s 

colti sh face . Like he knew 
omething the rest or the bro-

ken-hearted Triton fans and 
players did not. He did. 

He was on the U SD side-
line in 1994, when the Tritons 
lost 4-3 in triple overtime in the 
National hampionship game to 
Trenton tate. That game and 
that season bear many similari -
ties to thi s year's squad. 

First or all , McManu ' had 
nine freshme'n on hi ' team. One 
of the starters was an outstand-
ing blond-headed defender. 
Beth Freeburg. In the champi-
onship match. it was Freeburg 
who was in on the defensive 
lapse that led to Trenton State 's 
game-winning goal. That game 
was one of the most devastating 
losses ever for UCSD. 

HOWEVER. that match was 
the motivation for the next sea-
son. a season that UCSD domi-
nated with its group of sopho-
more sensations. They won the 
National hampionship. And 
the nex t one. And the next one. 

The similarities hetween 
then and now are striking. 
McManus had nine promising 
freshmen in 1998. A great 
blond-headed freshman defend-
er, Erika Alfredson, was in on 
the defensive lapse that ended 
up being the game-winning goal 
for St. Ben's. This, like '94. was 
a low point for the team. 

On Monday, though. th 
Tritons eemed upbeat. They 
seemed to have a trange look in 
their eye. They were talking 
about h w they could not wait 
for next year. 

Want to know why 
McManus had a curious look a 
he left the field '! He knows that

Tritons Get A.S. Support 
DIRECTOR: A.S. creates a new pO ition to improve tudent-athlete relation 
By Jacob Gordon 
Sports Editor 

Last Saturday. the U D 
women 's soccer team played a 
home NCAA playoff game in front 
of a crowd of over 600 fan . This 
represents about 4 percent of the 
oodergraduate enrollment at 
UCSD. yet the crowd at Triton 

occer Stadium was one of the 
largest all year. 

With the upcoming m ve to 
Division II , UC D students and 
faculty alike have been concerned 
about the lack of support ror the 
Triton . To address this need, the 
Associated Students Council has 
created the position of director of 

athlet iC relations on Oct. 21. This 
position was designed to be a li ai-
son between C San Diego 
Athletics and the Associated 
Students oun(;il. with its main 
objective to increase attendance at 
UCSD sporting events. 

Senior Robert Gordon was 
appointed director and has been 
working feveri shly to layout a plan 
that will fundamentally change stu-
dents ' social Ii fe at the university. 

At most other large 'ch ols. 
collegiate athletics are the focus of 
student life. At C D, however. 
athletic contest are almost always 
on the back burner. G rdon 'aid 
that hi mis ion is to bring the 

sporting events that occur every 
day here into the minds or the stu-
dents. 

"The idea that an increase in 
support for our athletic teams 
would somehow take away from 
the a(;ademi(; environment at 
U D is ludicrous," Gordon said . 
"Highly regarded academic univer-
sities comparable in size to UCSD, 
such as UCLA, Michigan, Stanford 
and ai, put a high value on athlet-
ics because they realize that a good 
athletic program can both benefit 
student 's social live as well as 
b st a chool's reputation." 

Gord n said that a ucce sful

though. UCSD's only home loss 
came at the hands of Washington 
Uni versity (Mo.) - a perenni al 

ational Champion 'hip contender. 
Thi s year's tournament conti n-
gency is equally strong, induding 
the troops from Hayward, Linfield
