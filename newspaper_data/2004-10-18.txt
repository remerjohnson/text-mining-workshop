Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee members are reconsid-
ering a plan to remodel their fee-
based stipends, as the university may 
have given them an unintended pay 
raise by increasing tuition fees in 
response to state budget cuts. 

The committee, consisting of 
faculty, representatives from 
Associated Students and students 
from all six colleges, advises Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 

registration and education fees, 
totaling SI,662 per academic year 
for work they do during the last 
two quarters of the year. The 
RFAC vice chair receives money 
totaling two quarters' worth of reg-
istration and education fees, or 
S3,324 per academic year for two 
quarters of work, while the RFAC 
chair, who works during aU three 
quarters, earns a stipend equal to 
three quarters worth of the fees, 
totaling S4,986 per academic year. 

Peters has represented the first 
district, which includes La Jolla, 
on the council or four years. He is 
the first city council incumbent to 
be forced into a runoff election in 
13 years, after he fell just short of 
the 50 percent of votes required to 
win in March's three-candidate 
March primary. 

More than 40 people attended 
the informal debate, hosted by the 
UCSD Institute for Continued 
Learning. The center invited the 
candidates as a part of its forum 
prognms.

, Joseph W. Watson on matters con-
cerning the use of registration fee 
funds. These funds, paid by stu-
dents in addition to regular tuition, 
subsidize a large number of student 
service programs across campus, 
including the Student Health 
Center and the Psychological 
Services Department. 

Student members first began 
receiving stipends last year. Faculty 
members do not get additional 
money for their work. 

According to Watson, the origi-
nal decision to base RFAC stipends 
on student fees stemmed from the 
committee's desire to set payments 
at a known number to attract 
potential members. 

A common concern among the 
attendees was San Diego traffic 
congestion, which was repeatedly 
addressed in the question-and-
answer section of the debate. 

"It's like San Diego is getting 
more people than it can build 
roads for," Cannel Valley resident 

Marietta Blake said of a 677 -home 
development approved by the city 
council last month, despite con-
cerns over impending traffic con-
gestion in neighboring areas. "We 
really have to do something about 
traffic before it gets worse." 

In response to such com-
pkints, Thalheimer outlined his 
intentions to overhaul a traffic

Appellate court throws out 
city's 'house party' ban 

By BENJAMIN IAIILETT 
Contributill8 Writer 

In a controversial decision, the 
San Diego Superior Court's 
Appellate Division struck down the 
city's "Social Host Ordinance" -
also called the "house party" ordi-
nance - as unconstitutionally 
broad in an Oct. 7 ruling. 

The law, enacted uoanimousJy by 
the city council in March 2003, was 
designed to curb underage drinking 
by making it illegal for hosts to sup-
ply alcohol to their underage guests. 

H convicted of the misdemeanor 
under the provision, violators faced 
up to a Sl,OOO fine and six months 
in county jail. . 

The appellate court struck 
down the law for its lack of speci-

ficity in defining what constitutes 
an infraction of the provision, call-
ing on lawmakers to revise it. 

"No criminal intent, knowledge 
or criminal negligence is required 
to establish a violation of the ordi-
nance," stated Judge Louis 
Hanoian, who chaired the three-
judge appellate panel. "The city 
council, if it wishes, knows how to 
express its intent that knowledge be 
an element of an offense." 

Proponents of the statute 
described it as an important step in 
combating illegal drinking. 

"This was a great tool for law 
enforcement," said Patty DriesJein, a 
community crime prevention adv0-
cate who supported the ordinance.

Police: Bike t~eft continues to grow 
Number stolen increased by five times since 2002 

By WlWAM CHING 
Contributing Writer 

Campus bike theft has climbed 
steadily, with the number of bicy-
cles stolen in 2004 expected to 
match or exceed last year's losses 
despite safety measures taken by 
students, according to campus 
police. 

Bike theft on campus has 
increased five-fold since 2002 
and more than seven-fold since 
2000, according to recent statis-
tics compiled by the UCSD 
Police Department. In 2003 
alone, the department received 
reports of more than 100 stolen 
bikes, a total loss valued in 
excess of $30,000. 

Thieves took more than 23 
bicycles in September, compared 
to eight during the same month 
last year. 

Bike theft is nothing new and 
continues to be a problem 
despite students' preventadve 
measures, Bicycle Enforcement 
Officer Ian Happle said, with 95 
percent of stolen bikes on cam-
pus having been originally pro-
tected with cable locks. 

-All cable locks, no matter 
what size, are braided," Happle 
said. -me tools) are 10 strong 
that they will cut through any 
tbicknell. " 

Despite reports of thieves 
using the backs of Bie ball-point 
pens to open lock-maker 
Kryptonite's tubular cylinder 
locks, this has not been a prob-
lem on campus, according to 
Happle. Breaking into a 
Kryptonite lock with a pen is 
much more cumbersome and 
time-consuming than simply cut-
ting a cable lock, he said. 

The main problem with bike 
theft, according to Happle, is that 
most students lock their bikes 

improperly. 
"A lot of it is not having the 

knowledge of locking it up," 
Happle said. 

Bicyclists should lock the bike's 
frame, rather than the wheel or 
the handlebars, to the bike rack, 
he said. • 

He also advised students to 
register their bikes.

Too much secrecy in biosafety 
. oversight. report finds 

less than five percent of committees 
responsible for oversight of potentially danger-
ous scientific researd, provide an "adequate" 
level of public oversight, according to a new 
survey. 

Performed by the Sunshine Project, an 
independent group opposed to weapons pro-
liferation, the study looked at compliance with 
information requests by 439 institutional 
biosafety committees at universities. institutes 
and companies. Under federal regulations. 
groups receiving federal research grants from 
the National Institutes of Health must maintain 
an IBC and make their records available to the 
public. 

Though originally created to address ethical 
concerns associated with recombinant DNA 
research, earlier reforms in 2004 have delegat-
ed to the committees the responsibility to 
monitor "dual-use' projects - projects that, if 
used b~ hostile groups, could threaten national 
security. 

Avanir Pharmaceuticals and four other San 
Diego companies failed to maintain an Lnsti-
tutional committee. despite government 
funding for grants that included the keyword 
"bioterrorismH and involved recombinant 
DNA. 

Though regulations require the commit-
tees to include independent community rep-
resentatives, "unaffiliated" IBC members at 
UC Davis include a biosafety officer from UC 
Berkeley and an employee of a local biotech-
nology company, the Sunshine Project 
found. 

While most UC campuses have committees 
that ' appear to operate, which is more than can 
be said of some state university systems: the 
university was "heavy-handed and inconsistent" 
in editing out potenlially proprietary information 
in response to the group's request, the report 
stated. 

"Some ue minutes so frequently refer to 
other documents that the committee's activities 
are obscured, greatly lessening the minutes' 
value: the group stated in the report . 

The study also char~ed the University of 
Texas Southwester with the most blatant eva-
sion of public accountability' for creating fake 
committees to hide IBe documenation. 

Presidential candidates 
favor financial aid reform 
President George W. Bush, Sen. John 

Kerry CD-Mass.) and Ralph Nader said they 
supported at least partial reform of the law 
that currently excludes students convicted of 
drug possession from receiving federal finan-
cial ald.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY. OCTOBER 18. 2004 

In response to questions compiled by the 
New Voters Project, Kerry said he did not 
believe that past nonviolent drug convictions 
should prevent students from applying for stu' 
dent aid. 

"Education is perhaps the best way for 
someone who has been involved with drugs or 
crime to tum their life around: Kerry said. 

Bush, too, said he supported partial reform, 
pointing to his 2005 budget request made to 
Congress that called on lawmakers to change 
the law and not target students for old viola· 
tions. 

However, Nader criticized the promises of a 
partial "fix," which he said would fail "to address 
the fundamental problems with the law.' 
Instead, he called for a full repeal of "this mis· 
guided law~ 

The question followed criticism from Rep. 
Mark Souder CR-Ind.), the author of the original 
exclusion. who has complained that the 
Department of Education has interpreted his 
law too broadly. 

Civilian pilot killed in

Sean DeRosier, the civilian pilot of a cus-

Miramar Air Show. 

In a release, the Marine Corps station said 
that the crash, which occurred at approximate-
ly 10: 15 a.m. on Oct 15, was under investiga-
tion. The crash caused no injuries on the 
ground. 

Though officials immediately suspended the 
air show after the crash, they restored flight 
operations approximately two hours later. . 

Professor wins Packard 
Foundation fellowship 

The David and lucile Packard Foundation 
has named assistant professor Trey Ideker, from 
UeSD's Jacobs School of Engineering, as one 
of 16 recipients of its 2004 Packard 
Fellowships for Science and Engineering. 

He will receive $625,000 in unrestricted 
research grants over a fIVe-year period. 

As a researcher in the relatively new field of 
systems biology, which attempts to model cel-
lular behavior as a complex network of inter· 
acting senes, proteins and other components, 
Ideker IS working on a computational model to 
explain diseases like cancer and develop tech-
niques for earlier diagnosis and better treat-
ment methods .. 

Established in 1988, the fellowship pro-
gram attempts to support "unusually creative'

F~s: Watson to make final call on stipend 
continued from page I 

A.S. Representative Charles 
Dahan said he believes RFAC 
stipends are a major factor in the 
quality of committee members. 

"Considering this is the most 
important committee on campus. 
as it relates to students. you need to 
have an applicable stipend to draw 
in the best students," he said. "The 
stipend isn't merely paying for the 
number of hours of work, its an 
award to the most qualified sru-
dents on campus to apply for this 
position." 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Edward J. Spriggs 
said the committee also justifies its 
stipends by the amount of worlt 

. accomplished. 
" [Committee members] worlt 

into the ninth or 10th weelt of 
spring quarter and have to cover a 
lot of business outside of the com-
mittee," he said. "They put a lot of 
time and effort into what they do." 

The committee's charter states 
that stipends "are intended to 
encourage srudent participation in 
the committee process and to 
unburden student members from 
having to worlt in order to pay fees 
because of their commitment of 
time and energy in worlcing for the 
RFAC." 

Lulu Ge, a John Muir College 
sophomore and RFAC member, 
proposed last year that committee 
members take a 10- to 15- percent 
pay cut. She also suggested that 
the stipend be made independent 
of changes in student fees, an 
amendment which would have 
talten effect for this years' stipends. 

According to' Ge, the value of 
the RFAC stipends should reflect 
the cuts made to units within stu-
dent affairs organizations. 

"I thought our stipends were 
high, " she said. "I thought it should 

reflect more of what other srudent 
groups were receiving." 

Ge's proposal for pay cuts was 
pushed baclt, however, as many 
committee members had conflicts 
with its timing late in the year. 

While Ge's proposal elicited 
questions concerning the stipends 
of RFAC committee members, it 
would not have any direct effect, 

" As a general principle, . it's not wise to give the 
committee power over its 

own stipends. " 
- Joseph W. WaIson. vice 

chancelfor of student affairs 
as their pay is at Watson's discre-
tion. The committee may only 
make recommendations to the 
vice chancellor. 

Watson, however, said he does 
not see any conflict if committee 
members recommend a cut in their 
own pay. 

. "As a general principle, it's wise 
not to give the committee power 
over its own stipends," he said. 
"But I don't see any difficulty if 
they want to take a pay cut." 

Watson and Spriggs also said 
that, for now, RFAC's stipends 
will remain fixed at the fall 2003 
level, although a pay raise in the 
future due to additional fee infla-
tion may be possible. If Watson 
decides to distribute stipends at 
the fall 2004 fee level, RFAC gen-
eral members would receive a 
raise of $233 each. 

Because of budget procedures, 
money saved by keeping the 
stipends at a fixed vaJue may not go 
directly to other student programs, 
but Rahaghi believes that any funds 
saved may be a benefit in the long 
run. 

"Its not like our salary takes 
away from appropriated funds," he 
said. "But obviously, if there is 
more money in the main pool, then 
it can go other places." 

The RFAC will examine Ges 
proposal for pay cuts more com-
prehensively when it reconvenes 
next quarter. 

Ge said that a reconsideration of 
her proposal may yield better results 
than the previous introduction. 

"The idea was rushed, so I think 
it was best that it didn't pass 
before," she said. "But 1 think it's 
important that we look at the issue 
again."

uc workers fight for living wage 
Cost--of--living more important than continued construction 

Everyone wants a piece of the pie. During boom years gone by, there was more than' 
enough to go around at the 
University of California, with 
administrators, faculty and staff 
well-compensated and students 
enjoying lower and lower fees. 
However, since the turn of the cen-
tury, the pie has shrunk and the 
various factions on campuses are 
left to fight over the scraps: 
Student's are calling for an end to 
fee hikes, administrators are doing 
rain dances for more funding and a 
union of university service workers 
represented by the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees are rallying 
for a cost-of-living adjustment. 
The current university budget 
doesn't include funds for cost-of-
living increases. The universi ty-
backed compact with the governor 
does provide funds for increases in 
future years, but the state legisla-
ture has yet to approve it. 

In the meantime, and despite 
the university'S precarious financial 
situation, leaving out these service 
workers - the people who serve 
our food, maintain our buildings 
and clean up after us -leaves a bad 
taste in one's mouth. After all, 
who's more deserving of a little 
pu blic help: students attending the 
best u1liversity system in the world, 

faculty with the opporrunity to 
conduct research with someone 
else's money, or the people actually 
getting their hands dirty and keep-
ing students fed and bathrooms 
usable. 

Despite the university's cries of 
poverty, it recently reached an 
agreement with UC patient-care 
workers that provides lO-per-
cent raises over the next three 
years. So we mow that the uni-
versity recognizes workers' 
plight - just not these 
workers. Because the ser-
vice workers are already 
among the worst paid 
university employees on 
campus at approxi-
mately $10 an hour, 
they are probably the J 
most deserving - and 
most in need - of a coSt- ~ 
of-living adjustment, espe-
cially in the day of S5 5 -a-bar-
rel oil and in an area like La 
Jolla. Yet, because the university 
has implicitly deemed them easily 
replaceable, they get the shaft. 

In light of these workers' plight, 
it seems very hypocritical of the 
university to undertake a multimil-
lion-dollar Price Center expansion 
project when it will be staffed by 
workers being paid near-poverty 
wages. In fact, despite the budget 
situation, UCSD in particular is 

Huerta .contrasts 
regents' inaccessibility 

By KELLY GILBERT 
Staff Writer 

The UC Student Association has 
called on Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger to appoint Delores 
Huerta to serve a full 12-year term 
as a regent, following her successful 
six-month stint as interim regent 
The seat of former regent Hailn 
Saban, open because he resigned 
after his poor attendence record at 
UC Board of Regents meetings was 
exposed, would be filled most appro-
priately by Huerta. 

The UC Board of Regent,<; -
that nebulous collection of powers-
that-be to whom we write all our 
checks, and whose mandates rule 
our calendars, course selections and 
pocketbooks - is composed of 26 
voting members. Eighteen regents 
are appointed by the California 
governor to 12 -year terms; one stu-
clent regent serves for a year; and 
several state officials, among others, 
serve as ex-oficio regents. 

Prior to her temporary appoint-
ment to the board, Huerta, who for-
mer Gov. Gray Davis appointed to 
temporarily fill an empty seat, was 
best known for her activist work with 
Cesar Chavez; together, the rwo 
founded the United Farm Workers 
Union. During her time on the 
board, Huerta was known for her 
support of students and minorities. 

"I'll bring the perspective of 
working people, women and people 
of color to the board," Huerta said 
in September 2003, upon her 
appointment as a temporary regent. 
"[t may be a perspective that hasn 't 
been widely represented." 

Huerta has charmed the UCSA 
by revealing ideals remarkably simi-
lar to those of students attending 
UC schools. For example, Huerta 
supported student protests during 
the budget cuts. She has been vocal 

about her disapproval of turning 
back applications from qualified 
junior college transfers, remarking 
that accepting in-state applications 
should be a uc priority. 

Perhaps Huerta's sympathy 
sterns from her background, for she 
is one of very few regents to have 
a ttended a UC school. Additionally. 
Huerta is one of very few regents to 
come from an underprivileged 
background. Saban, in contrast, is 
the father of Fox Family Worldwide 
and Saban Entertainment, whose 
brainchild was "Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers." Regent Sherry 
Lansing worlcs with the university 
in her spare time; generally, she's 
busy with her position as the chair-
man and CEO of Paramount 
Pictures. RegentJohn Moores owns 
the San Diego Padres. Financially, 
the vast majority of the regents are 
eons away from the average UC stu-
dent. The fate of a public education 
system should not rest solely in the 
hands of individuals who have so Iit-
de in common with those they 
serve. 

Huerta's official appointment 
would be a big step in opening the 
process of selecting regents and 
making the regents more accessible. 

"Traditionally, the regent 
appointment process is closed, and 
that is something we'd like to see 
changed," said J eruu fer Lilla, UCSA 
president. "[With a] more balanced 
process ... it could be a very different 
Board of Regents." 

If Schwarzenegger chooses to 
appoint Huerta to serve a full term, 
a clear message will be sent to the 
public: The government has the stu-
dents' concerns and best interests in 
mind and is open to feedback 
regarding public education. In so 
doing, he will also take a critical step 
toward building diversity on the UC 
Board of Regents.

continuing with a number of ambi-
tious construction projects. 
According to UCSD's 2003 uUlual 
financial report, UCSD booked 
SI.8 billion in revenue last year 
against only SI.6 billion in expen-
ditures, with the balance being 
spent on debt service, construc-
tion and capital improvements, 
according to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Business 
MEairs Margaret F. Pryatel. 
Granted, the university also 
needs to improve its stu-

_dI dent an~ research ~acilities 
~ to conunue attracung stu-

dents and faculty, but 
achieving that goal 

shouldn't preclude fairly 
paying its employees, who 

make the day-to-day opera-
tion of the university run 

smoothly. 
Despite the budget situa-

tion, the university has still 
managed to open a new campus 

at Merced for graduate students 
and hire three new chancellors. 

Why can't the university find it in 
its heart (or more relevantly, its 
budget) to help out the people who 
do the dishes? And if the university 
can't even afford to pay its staffers a 
reasonable salary, one should won-

der whether it should even be 
opening any new campuses. 

Also included in UCSD's long -
term plans are a new and improved 
Price Center, a new housing devel-
opment for Sixth College and an 
opera house to be built near Price 
Center. With all those big plans in 
store, it's probably easy to forget 
about campus workers. After all, if 
they do their job well, no one's even 
supposed,ro notice them. 

As a public institution, the 
University of California has an 
obligation to treat its workers fair-
ly, even workers that serve food 
and clean bathrooms. Having tens 
of thousands of university employ-
ees - essentially state employees 
- earning near poverty wages is 
not a good thing for the state and 
is a black eye for the universi ty. [n 
the grand scheme of things, the 
money necessary to implement 
such an agreement would be rela-
tively small compared to UCSD's 
total resources - or even the 
money the university spends to 
beautify its campus. That's why the 
University of California should 
bite the bullet and extend cost-of-
living adjusunents to all UC work-
ers, even if it means holding up 
plans for shiny new buildings.

Where have all the virtues gone? 
The death of the 'public good' illlusion 

living 
Delioerate 

Robin Averbeck 

YOU don't hear much about the public good these days. In the modern political mar-
ket, votes are bought and sold with 
the currency of personal promises 
and appeals, and any image of a 
larger purpose fades into the back-
ground of rhetorical appeals to the 
"American Dream." If a politician 
gave so much as a five-second 
sound bite asking individuals to sac-
rifice for the public good, the audi-
ence would blink a few times and 
ponder what exactly this guy means 
by "the public good." 

But [ judge too quickly. The 
public good is actually being dis-
cussed in the political forum today; 
it just so happens that it always 
equates to your personal good. 
What is good for you is, of course, 
good for everyone, and each politi-
cal party would like us to believe 
that it owns the public good. That~ 
why you have to vote for its candi-
date, after all : The other guy is 
going to destroy the American 
Dream! 

But before we get carried away, 
might we ask ourselves, does a pub-
lic good actually exist' Considering 
th.at political science theory has 
proven that such a thing is pure 
fantasy, we might conclude that our 
discussion ends here. But like many 
things in society, the effects of col-
lective cultural belief can be consid-
erable. A popular belief in a public 
good seems preferable to aclcnowl-
edging rampant shortsightedness 

that now characterizes our democ-
racy. 

The symptoms of this disease 
are right in front of us: Both the 
demonstration last year against 
higher fees for students and the 
current rally by UCSD staff are 
examples of the "this democracy is 
made to serve me" mentality. 
While everyone can probably agree 
that both of these events revolve 
around legitimate issues and com-
plaints, let's look at it from a more 
comparative view, focusing on the 
student protest last year. [n every 
government, there are limited 
resources - and the state of things 
in California could not exactly be 
described as abundance. Former 
Gov. Gray Davis was just booted 
out of office in the fallout of a huge 
budget crisis with resources tapped 
to the limit. Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger came in!o office 
on a premise of balancing things 
out, mowing he'd have to cut some 
places and raise others. While it is 
unfortunate that student fees were 
raised, can we honestly claim to be 
one of the most desperate sectors of 
the population? While protesting 
students stopped traffic and dis-
played their extreme poverty in the 
streets of La Jolla - of all places-
they would have you believe that 
they are some of the most destitute 
and neglected victims of the state. 
Poor UCSD students, attending 
one of the top universities in the 
country. 

But no one needs to worry -
our politicians are going to give 
you anything and everything. The 
list of promises supplied by presi-
dential candidate John Keny so far 
is quite impressive. Vice 
Presidential candidate John 
Edwards let me know the other day 
that he is fighting for me, the aver-
age American, and what is impor-

tant to me. I was very touched, so I 
decided to send !um a little list. 
First, I find it really annoying that 
everything closes in La Jolla as 
soon as the sun sets. Second, my 
landlord won't let me keep a dog 
- it makes me awfully lonely and 
some dog somewhere has died in a 
shelter because of him. And finally, 
could you please get rid of "The 
Surreal Life" on VH P That show 
is just so damn annoying. 

The problem may not be so bad 
at the moment, but it's only gerting 
worse. The main question is: Does 
democracy mean everyone gerting 
everything they want at the stan-
dard they feel they are entitled to' 
And even if th.e answer could possi-
bly be yes, what does that say about 
our national character? Today's pol-
itics have taught us to be self-inter-
ested - the original American 
ideal of citizens making decisions 
based on the greater good is buried 
under 230 years of dirt, where it 
apparently belongs. 

It seems to me that there are 
clearly a few pressing issues that 
should be considered before' all 
else, yet nearly none of the protest 
you'll see in the streets or on cam-
puses these days have to do with 
them. Medicare and Social 
Security can be saved, but only if 
everyone is willing to engage in a 
little self-sacrifice, whether it is 
through higher taxes or cuts in 
programs. But that is a breadth of 
vision totally lacking in our coun-
try today. Perhaps that's only nat-
ural; I suppose the public good 
cannot coexist with private inter-
ests - but I guess I'm just a little 
nostalgic for when we at least pre-
tended to be virtuous.

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Administration in 
support of co-ops 

Dear Editor: 
Over the last few weeks, there 

have been several articles and opin-
ion pieces in the Gutlrditm regard-
ing the status of the UCSD co-ops. 

As the assistant vice chancellor of 
student life, I have been involved in 
the negotiations for a 'new agree-
ment with the co-ops and can assure 
you that UCSD supports the contin-
ued oo-campus presence of the stu-
dent-run co-ops, and we are hopeful 
that we can soon arrive at a mutually 
acceptable agreement. The co-ops 
provide students with a valuable 
educational, student development, 
and co-curticular experience and 
service to the UCSD community. 

Since fall 2003, UCSD Student 
Affairs representatives have been 
engaged in negotiations with repre-
sentatives from the co-ops, 
Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association to 
develop a new set of agreements to 
guide the future operation of the co-
ops. At the end of the 2004 spring 
quarter and just as the negotiations 
on one of the agreements was to be 
mutually agreed upon by all parties, 
an attorney on behalf of the co-ops 
asserted that the prior agreements 
were intended to exist in perpetuity. 
As a resul t, the administrative review 
and negotiations process berween 
Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association, the 
co-ops and Student Affairs represen-
tatives shifted int~ the legal arena. 

The university chose to negoti-
ate direcdy with the co-ops and 
their attorney. Under the proposed 
new agreements, the university 
would continue to provide the co-
ops with discounted rental rates as 

well as long-term leases. 
Over the last year, there have 

been several significant health and 
safety code violations at the co-ops. 
It would be irresponsible of the 
university to overlook these viola-
tions. To ensure that health and 
safety standards are maintained and 
that university policies and sound 
financial practices are followed, it is 
essential tha t the co-ops be held 
directly accountable for their oper-
ations. We believe this is in the best 
interests of all UCSD srudents and 
the campus community. 

We value the involvement of 
Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association as 
advocates for student interests. 
However, University Centers has 
the staffing, expertise and ",andate 
to provide such oversight.

Race: Voters probe contenders at debate 
continued from pa(t J 

During the debate, Thalheimer 
also ~ the introduction of 
reversible lanes as a solution to traffic 
problelllS. Such lanes, which are used 
to serve heavy traffic in one direction 
during the morning and the other 
direction during the afternoon, are 
currendy used on the Coronado Bay 
Bridge and Interstate 15. 

"Reversible lanes are a very inex-
pensive solution," he said. "It's mil-
lions less than some of the other 
proposals. " 
. Peters also discussed congestion 

solutions at the debate, including 
the "Super Loop" city project. He 
described the plan as "an internal 
circulation element that will use 
'flex-trolleys' to connect key points 
in University City, including the 
future Nobel Coaster Station, 
[University Towne Center], busi-
nesses, residential areas and 
UCSD." The system would reduce 
traffic flow by providing the option 
of public transportation. 

Peters, a member of the 
California Coastal Commission 
and the Land Use and Housing 
Conunittee, oversaw the comple-
tion of State Route 56, which 

opened in July and connects 
Interstates 5 and IS. Construction 
of the S220-million, four-lane 
highway began in 1999, but was 
delayed by multiple financial and 
environmenciJ concerns. 

"J was so happy to finally see 
(SR 56) finished," Del Mar resident 
Larry Porter said. "I use that route 
a lot now, and it's something this 
council should be very proud of." 

However, Thalheimer argued 
that the route is much less conve-
nient for North County residents 
than Peters had expected. 

Thalheimer also said he was told 
by city engineers prior to the open-
ing of the interstate that they were 
"deeply concerned that once [SR 
56] opens, traffic will flow into these 
neighborhoods." Thalheimer also 
said that the engineers' suggestions 
for mitigating traffic were ignored. 

Some SR 56 commuters agreed 
that the route, which was planned 
with no direct connecting ramps 
eastward off southbound Interstate 
5, or north to Interstate 5, was not 
as practical as it once seemed. 

"I thought it was an amazing 
idea at first," La Jolla resident Julia 
Thompson said. "But when you use 

it, it doesn't really go to major 
places you want, and the traffic gets 
really bad during peak hours. " . 

Thalheimer also said he 
believed his experience with both 
financial and information city sys-
tems would give him the knowl-
edge to serve the district well . . 

"I've interfaced with every 
department within the city of San 
Diego," he said during the debate. 
"I have the relationships. I under-
stand the bureaucracy. I know what 
works and what does not work." 

While traffic congestion was the 
biggest concern among the older 
attendees of the debate, Peters said 
the problem also involves universi-
ty students. 

"One of the challenges we have 
is UCSD, which is going to go 
from a population of 31,000 total 
students and administration up to 
61,000 in a decade," Peters said. 
"I have no control over that, but 
wllat I'm trying to do is to use the 
community planning process to 
make sure we have good trans~ 
portation. "

Party: Law unco~stitutional, la~yer argued 
continued from page I 

"Police were going to these houses 
with underage drinJdng but nothing 
really happened to the host .... This 
gets at the root of the problem." 

Opponents said the biU placed an 
unfair burden on party hosts. 

"If you throw a party, how are 
you going to control all the people 
who come?" Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Heetae Kim said. "I 
can't be held responsible for every-
body. It should be t/;\eir responsibil-
ity to drink or not ... 

Despite the ruling, the court did 
uphold the spirit of the law. 

"Attempting to decrease the 
incidence of underage consump-
tion is a proper and laudable gov-
ernment purpose," the court's 

opinion stated. 
The case was filed when Derek 

Blithe, a student at San Diego 
State, was arrested after two under-
age girls were found drinking at a 
fraternity party at his home in 
Mission Beach. 

Blithe and his attorney, Patrick 
Dudley, challenged the law in 
court. Although the court found in 
favor of the city, Blithe and his 
attorney appealed the ruling. The 
appellate panel that overseas mis-
demeanor appeals overruled the 
Superior Court's decision. 

"It was a fantastic ruling," 
Dudley said. "[This law) has seri-
ous impacts on the freedom to 
assemble .... You should be able to 
have those folks over without con-

standy monitoring everybody, 
making sure nobody slips some 
rum into their Coke. It's a really 
good decisio!l for college stu-
dents." 

However, the decision may not 
be the final ruling in the case. The 
city is planning to appeal the 
court's decision, according to 
Maria Velasquez, press secretary _ 
for the city attorney's office. 

Though she said the case was 
"very important," City Counsel 
Simon Silva declined to comment 
on the merits of the decision until 
after the appeal. Silva helped to 
write the original ordinance.

Thefts: Most stolen bikes 
secured with cable locks 

continued from pa,e I 
your bike registered," Happle said. 
"If anything, [registering) shows 
ownership. " 

The chance of recovery increas-
es significantly if a person registers 
a bike, he said. Authorities cannot 
always press charges against a thief 
with an unregistered bike because 
there is no concrete proof of origi-
nal ownership. 

One of the reasons biJce theft 
keeps rising is the growing campus 
student population, Crime 
Prevention Officer Kri 5 teen 
McCollough said. 

Bike thieves are able to steal 
bikes in the middle of the day 
because students are not paying 
much attention to suspicious activ-
ity, and most thieves are able to 
blend into the campus community, 
making catching them much more 
difficult, she said. 

"J ust the fact that someone is 
looking at you, makes the (thief] 
feel uncomfortable," McCollough 
said. "If the community paid more 
attention we might be able to 
make them move somewhere 
else." 

Students should remain vigilant, 
keep an eye on their belongings on 

a day-to-day basis and report suspi-
cious activity immediately to the 
campus police department. 
Students should also report any 
theft within 48 hours to improve 
the chances of catching the suspect, 
McCollough said. 

Some of the more popular 
locations for bicycle theft include 
Price Center, Geisel Library and 
Library Walk. Most thefts in these 
areas occur between 9 a.m. and 5 
p.m. on Fridays, Tuesdays and 
Sundays, according to recent sta-
tistics. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Roland Chang said his 
bike was stolen the day after he 
moved in. Chang said he is still 
angry because the bilce had senti-
mental value for him, and he now 
uses two locks to secure his new one. 

John Muir College freshman 
Charles Yi, whose bike went miss-
ing in early October, said the expe-
rience was a very frustrating one. 

"T.1e recent rise of bike theft is 
ridiculous," Yi said. "I think the 
thieves should find a new profes-
sion."

Isla Vista throws the biggest, drunken Halloween bash in California 

I t'S that magical time of year again: costume superstores are in full swing and seem to have 
appeared on every corner, girls 
begin to plan their cosrumes around 
the least amount of clothmg possi-
ble, and every srudent at UCSD 
asks the same question - what am 
I going to do for Halloween? While 
no one would dispute that UCSD is 
a great academic university, few 
would say that our campus supports 
great partying. 

If handing out miniarure 
Snickers to trick-or-treaters is 
your idea of a great time, then 
UCSD is the place for you; howev-
er, for those who want to party on 
Halloween, a trip up to UC Santa 
Barbara, home of the largest 
Halloween celebration in 
California, may be called for. 

Del Playa Drive - the main 
street in the srudent-friendly Isla 
Vista community in which UC Santa 
Barbara is situated - is ground zero 
for partying. Sometimes referred to 
as Bourbon Street West, Del Playa is 
filled to the brim with masses of 
drunk, costumed college srudents 
from all over the state and county 
during] IalJoween. Last year 40,000 
peopLe flocked to Isla Vista; this year 
police estimate that even more will 
come for a weekend-long celebra-
tion. While the biggest party is on 
the street, every house on Del Playa 
seems to have a party ranging from 
20 people gathered around a keg to 
huge, SOD-people parties with live 
music. Sixth College Junior arah 
Green describes it as "[San Diego] 
State with more people and less 
clothes." 

Since Halloween falls on a 
Sunday this year, you have every 
reason to start celebrating at Isla 
Vista on Friday night;. However, 
before the celebration begins, you 
have to get to UC Slint'd Barbara. 
The college is about 200 miles 
away, and without traffic would 
probably take three hours to reach. 
However, commute traffic may 
double that time. Once in Santa 
Barbara, you'll need a place to stay. 
Whether it be a friend's off-campus 

'house or a cheap motel a couple 
miles away (you will be spending 
very little time there), make sure to 
have some place to go in the early 
morning. If you have friends who 
live on campus, do not try to stay 
with them: UC Santa Barbara is 
forbidding any visitors at the dorms 
over Halloween weekend. 

For those not staying within 
walkillg distance of Del Playa, the 
best way to get there is either by taxi 
or by bus. However, remember there 
is going to be a huge demand fOr 
taxis, so there may be a bit of a wait. 

Every year Santa Barbara police 
say that they will crack down on the 
annual celebration. However, last 
year, in a crowd of 40,000 belligerent 
people, only 260 citations or arrests 

were made, so the odds of avoidillg a 
run-in with the police are good. 
Avoid doing anything blatantly sru-
pid. For example, do not walk 
around the streets with an open con-
tainer; instead, invest in a flask. And 
guys, avoid public urination: If 
caught, you will face a S I ,000 fine. 

"I saw some cops come on a 
couple occasions, but only for seri-
ous things," Revelle SOphomore 
Omar Nassar said. "The ratio of 
people to cops was ridiculous. 
Everyone was drunk and JUSt 
walked the streets up and down 
checking out costumes, sOcializing, 
and having fun." 

Once on Del Playa; prepare for 
chaos. There are parries in many 
houses on Del Playa, so practice 

Isla Vista's trick-or-treating tradi-
tion: Walk to a house that's parry-
ing and ask, "Got a keg?" Showing 
a little skin won't hurt either; most 
of the time you will be invited in to 
partake in the festivities. Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Junior Brittany 
Bendix described her favorite Isla 
Vista experience. 

"My most memorable experience 
in Santa Barbara was at a party that 
set up a table to dance on," Bendix 
said. "There were so many people 
that it came crashing down, but no 
one noticed and lcept dancing." 

Revelle Junior Jill Bardakos 
described moving around Del Playa, 
saying, "It's harder to wa1k through 
Del Playa than to [find] a party in La 
Jolla." 

Last year, creative and minimal-
clothing costumes ruled; Playboy 
bunnies and Hugh Hefuers roamed 
the streets in mass; larger-than-life 
tinfoil penises and sperm swam 
through crowd; pirates "sailed" 
down Del Playa on their wheeled 
ships; sex fairies promised great sex 
for all; and Party Boy, clad only in a 
Speedo, greeted partyers all night. 

"I would tell anyone to go to N 
for HallQw~en," John Muir College 
Junior Jeff Kemper said. "It's an 
insane all-weekend, a11-night-and-
day party. You'll have the time of 
your life." 

But he cautions, "You won't 
remember any of it." Be sure to 
bring a camera, a costume and 
endurance. 

J on Stewart and 'The Daily Show' write off 'America' 
Comical textbook pokes fun at our country's questionable political past 
By MARIANNE MADDEN 

Senior Staff Writer 

A merica (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction" is a 
thick, hardback tome that looks 
and feels like a government text-
book, yet is so engaging (and 
sometimes nonfacrual) that it suc-
ceeds much better than most text-
books currently being used in 
schools. 

Written by Jon Stewart and the 
rest of the crew behind Comedy 
Central's immensely popular 
mock-newscast "The DaiLy 
Show," the book marks thei r brave 
foray into comedy in written 
form. Using standard textbook 
conventions, the book jumps nim-
bly between discussions of 
" Democracy Before America ," the 
three branches of government, the 
American media, elections, the 
future of democracy and a dash of 
world srudies. 

After suffering through many 

rounds of history, social studies . 
and civics classes, reading preten-
tious , boring textbooks, 
"America" is a tremendously 
rewarding breath of fresh air. The 
very textbook conventions real 
schoolbooks drive into the ground 
(footnotes, classroom activities, 
discussion questions, and factoids 
under the heading, "Did You 
Know?") are the very fearures that 
"America" simultaneously mocks 
and uses to great effect. 

Except, as the book notes, the 
phrase "Did You Know?" is trade-
marked by a rival publisher, so 
"America" uses the heading 
"Were You Aware?" instead. 

For what it's worth, "America" 
varies its formats more, and to 
much better effect, than real text-
books, with th<:ir huge, continu-
ous blocks of dry text. Certainly 
no traditional history textbooks 
have dedicated space to "Ranking 
the Presidents" or "The Brain of 
the Pundit," or dared to repro-
duce a menu from the 

Congressional cafeteria or to have 
a game entitled "Dress the 
Supreme Court," which fea~res 
computer-assembled images of aLI 
nine justices buck-naked. 

"America" is peppered with 
short first-person perspectives 
written by "The Daily Show" cor-
respondents Rob CQrddry, 
Stephen Colbert, Ed Helms, and 
Samantha Bee, but generally these 
fall flat (except for Colbert's 
"Warren G. Harding: Our Worst 
President," which is brilliant). 
Weak as they are, they succeed in 
providing a welcome and effective 
change in the book's tone and 
point of view - something not 
even real textbooks have managed 
to accomplish with t1ieir use of 
first-person essays. 

Paradoxically, a book which 
uses as jumping-off points the 
most stultifying features of our 
history, textbooks, news broad-
casts and political campaigns is a 
sharply intelligent and incredibly 
entertaining work. Its writers have 

a better grasp of America's history, 
political process, and struggles 
than do most journalists, politi-
cians and textbook writers. 
Perhaps the "!unerica" writing 
team sbould give up the comedic 
genre and write a true textbook-
students the country over would 
rejoice. 

But the irony is that "America" 
succeeds as a true reference book 
and an informative complement 
to any high school . graduate's 
existing knowledge of history and 
government. Its treatments of 
early philosophers, the founding 
fathers and the presidents are 
especially good. They're incredi-
bly colorful, and they inform 
while they entertain with all man-
ners of quips, jabs and outright 
jokes ("Though Ronald Reagan 
was not considered 
Kennedyesque, many historians 
believe he was among our most 
Reaganesque commanders in

America: Book's critiques 
unflinchingly accurate 

continued from page 8 
chiet"). 

The book does contain a fair 
amount of outright fiction, but 
who wouldn't argue that the 
made-up quote by Nixon, "The 
power was nice, but franlc1y I 
could've used more power," 
nonetheless strikes a t the heart of 
Nixon's presidency? It's these 
underlying truths, disguised as 
absurdly made-up quotes and 
facts , that make the book so 
artestingly. hilariously intelligent. 
The authors aren't afraid to make 
fun of historical figures and 
events. the writers of convention-
al textbooks, the educational sys-
tem. the American media, readers' 
own biases and prejudices and 
themselves - sometimes all at the 
same time. 

And they aren 't afraid to com-
bine highbrow humor with politi-
cal incorrectness. One "Were You 
Aware?" box informs us that 
"96%" of congressional incum-
bents are re-elected - which 
means the other 4% must really 
suck." A caption on a photo o~ 
George W. Bush reads. "This 
Connecticut-born, Yale- and 
Harvard-educated multimillion-
aire son of a former president ran 
as an outsider in 2000. Many 
experts still wonder how the fuck 
he pulled that off." And in the 
middle o f being ta ught about the 
voting process we're told, "Before 
1920. women used to call Election 
Day 'Stay Home and Cook D ay.' 
Though they wo n 't admit it , 
women were much happier when 
all they had to do was bake shit 
and pump out kids." 

The beaury is all are skewered 
equally in "America" - even · 
women and minorities (and. in 

turn, bigots are given a sound 
trouncing). The ultimate message is 
that every group in America has its 
foibles - foibles that, if exposed in 
just the right manner. as the book 
usually manages to do, are scream-
ingly funny. 

The wisdom in "America" lies 
in the way it promotes a more 
accurate picture of our nation and 
our history than most real text-
books. We're a nation at odds 
with ourselves - so complacent 
that we don 't bother to vote, 
xenophobic and ignorant in many 
respects, given over to selfishness 
and greed. glued to our TVs. des-
tined for a furore that's most like-
ly bleak. "America " could be 
interpreted as a call to arms. It 
could be interpreted as a work 
born out of cynicism and anti-
Americanism. Or it could be 
interpreted as a bunch of on-air 
comedians simply taking humor 
in strange, uncharted directions. 

But for those of us who mea-
sure America's worth by our 
capaciry to laugh at ourselves. the 
book is a valuable and poignant 
add ition to our national con-
sciousness.

athletes down played the impor-
tance of the milestone, it is critical 
for the UCSD athletics program. 
With the win, Armstrong joins 
women's soccer coach Brian 

McManus in the 300-club, making 
the pair the only two active coach-
es in NCAA soccer history to 
record 300 victories at the same 
school. 

"I'm not into all that stuff," 
Armstrong said after the game and 
a brief celebration with his players. 
"But obviously this win is a won-
derful achievement for our pro-
gram. Hopefully we can get a few 
more." 

The Tritons have five more 
chances after the Chico State game 
to garner more wins before the 
playoffs, including an Oct. 17 
match against Cal State Stanislaus.

another sweep. UCSD toole. an 
early 4-0 lead in game three and 
never looked back despite efforts 
by Cal State Los Angeles' ~enior 
middle blocker Te'Ara Epps and 
sophomore outside hitter Ashley 
Hardwick to keep their team in 
the match. The Golden Eagles 
could not contain the UCSD 
offense, completing the sweep by 
taking game three. 

Epps and Hardwick recorded 
15 and 12 Ic.ills, respectively, but it 
was not enough to earn the 
Golden Eagles any games as they 
were punished for having com-
mitted seven service errors and 
coming up with only 34 digs com-
pared to the Tritons' 55. 

The Tritons are currently 21-1 
overall and 9-1 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
Over the course of the season, the 

Triton starters have solidly con-
tributed to the team while also get-
ting help from the bench when 
needed. The rookie Facchini was a 
defensive staple for UCSD, leading 
the team in digs on at least five 
occasions. 

"This is the best experience," 
Facchini said. "It's so much fun and 
competitive at the same time. 
Every single person has energy that 
I feed off of and [my teammates] 
are so helpful. I feel so comfortable 
to be a part of them." 

The Tritons have seven regular 
season matches left, including an 
upcoming five-game home stand. 

"We have a five-game home 
stand and that's good," Ohta said. 
"It's exciting to be back at home. 
But we still have seven games left 
and we're not getting ahead of our-
selves." 

The next home match is Oct. 22 
against Chico State at RIMAe 
Arena. Game time is 7 p.m.

Women's soccer records 1,1 
deadlock with Chico State 

Battle between CCAA North and South 
leaders proves indecisive' after overtime 

By CYNIHIA BLADE 
CHAVEl 

Associate Sports Editor 
It was billed to be the epic 

battle of North vs. South as 
the UCSD women's soccer 
team, the South Division 
leaders of the California 
Collegiate Athletic 
Association, faced off against 
North Division leaders Chico 
State in an important confer-
ence match on Oct. 15 at 
RIMAC Field. 

It proved to be an even-
handed match, with the 
injury-riddled Tritons playing 
the Wildcats to a 1-1 tie. The 
Tritons had to contend with 
injuries as junior defender 
Heather Sufraniec played on 
an ankle she hurt while prac-
ticing and senior goalie Jarnie 
LautenschJeger coped with a 
hand imparement from the 
previous match. 

"We're the top team in the 
south and [Chico State) is the 
top team in the north," head 
coach Brian McManus said. 
"We've got a couple of people 
playing with injuries tonight 
Heather Sufraniec at the 
bacle. was playing [hurt). But 
that's the way it goes. [Chico 
State) is a good team. They're 
more experienced ' than us, 
they're older than us. But I'll 
taIc.e it. It's a good result" 

UCSD strucle. first in the 
opening half, scoring in the 
eighth minute. The Tritons 
had three consecutive comer 

kiclc.s and capitalized on their 
third try. Junior defender 
Kristina De La Rosa sent in 
the shot that sophomore mid-
fielder Megan Dicle.ey headed 
home, putting the Tritons 
ahead, 1-0. UCSD continued 
to pressure Chico State's 
defense, outshooting them 5-
2 in the first period. 

In the second half, the 
Wildcats regrouped and 
scored in the 52nd minute to 
tie the match at 1-1. 
Sophomore midfielder Jessica 
Parker passed the ball to 
freshman forward Courtney 
Quan, who beat the last 
Triton to go one-on-one with 
Lautenschleger. Quan polc.ed 
the ball past her to record her 
first goal of tbe season. 

Play became tighter after 
the game-tying goal and both 
teams traded scoring chances, 
with the Tritons threatening 
the Wildcats' defense toward 
the end. With a few minutes 
left in the match, UCSD 
sophomore forward Kelly 
Cochran fliclc.ed the ball with 
the outside of her foot to 
onrushing freshman forward 
Ali Lai, who was chopped 
down by Wildcat sophomore 
defender Jennifer Hogans. 
Hogans was penalized with a 
yellow card and UCSD was 
awarded a free kicle. with less 
than two minutes remaining, 
but was unable to score. The 
Tritons Ie.ept things exciting in 
the final minute when their 
comer Ic.iclc. was headed out of 

the way by Chico State, but 
Ic.icked back by UCSD, caus-
ing a mad scramble in the box. 
The Chico State goalkeeper 
was Ic.noclc.ed down, leaving 
the net open, but the Wildcats 
cleared the ball, sending the 
match intO overtime. 

Dickey toole. a free kicle. for 
UCSD in the first overtime 
period that sophomore mid-
fielder Heather Sugg headed 
wide of the net. A few minutes 
later, De La Rosa had a free 
Ic.icle. at the edge of the box 
that just sailed over the upper-
left comer of the net. Play 
remained even in double 
ovenime, and the Tritons 
almost scored the game-win-
ner when Cochran got a shot 
off that nearly skipped under 
a diving Wildcat's goalie with 
four minutes left. After close 
calls for both teams, the 
Tritons and Wildcats settled 
for a 1-1 tie. 

"I think. we played really 
well," Sufraniec said. "It's just 
one of those games where it 
doesn't go your way. We tried 
hard and did almost every-
thing right and just didn't 
have the lucie.." 

McManus was pleased 
with his team's efforts and says 
the team just needs to keep up 
its play for the next match 
against Cal State Stanislaus. 

"We're going to bounce 
baclc. from it," McManus said. 
"We just have to Ie.eep the ball 
and capitalize on our chances 
a little more."

Men's soccer busts slump, downs Chico State 
Coach Annstrong earns 300th career victory as Triton 

By RAEL ENTEEN 
Contributing Writer 

With a 1-0 win over the Chico 
State Wildcats on Oct. 15 at 
RIMAC Field, the UCSD men's 
soccer team put an end to a frus-
trating losing streak and picked up 
career win number 300 for head 
coach Derek Armstrong, the cor-
nerstone of the Triton soccer pro-
gram for 22 years. 

Following two losses on the 
road to .Cal State San Bernardino 
and Cal' State Monterey Bay, the 
Tritons were in desperate need of a 
win to keep their playoff hopes 
alive. 

Every player on the team knew 
the importance of this game, not 
only because of the milestone for 
Armstrong and the UCSD athlet-
ics department, but also for the 
team's confidence and momentum 
going into the final five games of 
the regular season. 

"This win was awesome, and it 
was something we needed," junior 
dcfenseman Kevin Murray said. 
"H opefully it wiJl be a turning 
point for the rest of the season." 

If M urray's postseason perfor-
mance is anything like his play 
against Chico State, the T ritons 
will be in a great position going 
into the playoffs. Murray was 
responsible fo r the only goal of 
the game, his fi rst of the season, 
which came in the 7 1 st minute, 

following a spectacular defensive 
showing in the first half by both 
teams. The assist came from 
senior defenseman/midfielder 

. Nick Marquand, who dribbled 
the ball down the left sideline 
before his cross pass found 
Murray six yards out for the 
score. The slim lead electrified 
the crowd and returned to the 
Tritons the once-abundant confi-
dence they had at the beginning 
of the season. 

With a defense that had domi-
nated throughout the first half, the 
Tritons were able to trust senior 
goalkeeper Edward Ruhland to 
keep the ball out of the net. 
Ruhland did just that and picked 
up the shutout win, his first of the 
season. 

The Wildcats had several scor-
ing opportunities, but failed to 
convert on all of them because of 
Ruhland's four saves and the 
Tritons' stingy defense. Chico 
State goalie Brian Linne topped 
Ruhland with eight saves but let 
through what turned out to be the 
crucial shot. 

Threl! of Linne's saves came 
during the 56th minute, when the 
Tritons had three textbook scoring 
chances. Junior mid fielder 
Matthew Davey lined a direct pass 
in front of the net, setting the 
!! tage for back-to-back Triton 
headers that Linne batted away to 
keep the Wildcats in the game.

However, with UCSD outshoot-
ing Chico State 13-5, it was no 
wonder that the Tritons walk.ed 
away with a victory. 

The win upped UCSD's 
record to 6-2-3 overall and 5-2-2 
in league play, making the 
Tritons contenders for the 

California Collegiate Athletic 
Association championship and 
increasing thier chances of mak-
ing the NCAA Division II play-
offs.

No.6 men's water polo upset by No.7 LMU 
Nearly 1,800 on hand as WWPA rival silences Tritons at homecoming 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

T he deck of Canyonview Pool 
came to life in the hQur before the 
N o. 6 UCSD men's water polo 
team's home game on Oct. 15 
against No. 7 Loyola Marymount. 
The aluminum bleachers filled , the 
pep band blared, the beer gardens 
swarmed and the pool rocked 
tumultuously as the teams prepared 
to square off against one another in 
a rematch of the 2003 and 2004 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championship Finals. Despite the 
roaring, sellout crowd of 1,779, 
UCSD fell to the Lions, 8-4. 

The Tritons came out strong, 
winning the opening sprint to go 
first onto offense. After losing the 
ball on a deflected shot, Triton 
junior goalie Colin McElroy 
denjed the Lions' first attempt. 

Then came the first signs of 
trouble for UCSD. A quick 
turnover resulted in a Loyola 
Marymount counterattack and 
shot, which was tipped on its way 
out by a Triton. Armed with a fresh 
35-second shot clock, the Lions 
mustered their first goal just more 
than three minutes into the game. 

But defense was not where 
UCSD fell . On the next posses-
sion, the Tritons set up their 
offense and took a shot only to see 
it blocked; however, a dead-time 
ejection led to the first of eight, 
six-on- five opportunities for 
UCSD. The Tritons failed to con-
vert seven of those chances into 
goals, costing the usually effective 
Tritons the potential victory. 

Freshman driver Adnan 
Jerkovic scored the only man-up 
goal with one minute, 25 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter on 
the second UCSD man-up play.

right post and past the Loyola

Marymount goalie'S head, was his 
only score of the match. 

"We were one-for-eight on our 
six-on-fives," Jerkovic said. "That 
in itself was the worst thing we 
could have done." 

To the credit of Loyola 
Marymount, this game was destined 
to be a battle between rivals. While 
the Tritons faltered offensively, the 
Lions played exceptionally on both 
ends of the tank. Throughout the 
game, while the Tritons set up their 
offense and tried to work the ball 
into ' two-meters, Loyola 
Marymount was crashing hard md 
fast to force either a shot or a 
turnover. While on defense, the 
Tritons tried to do the same thing, 

but the Lions were still getting 
effective shots off, despite double 
coverage. 

On offense, even though two-
meters was not always the safest 
place to play the ball, UCSD was 
struggling to make decent shots 
from the outside. 

"We weren't shooting well on 
the outside," Jerkovic said. "So we 
kept trying to work it in, but they 
play a crash defense and have a 
really good goalie." 

That said, it's easy to see why the 
Triton offense never found its 
rhythm: Two of the team's four 
goals were scored on shots IlIken 
&om the perimeter, while only one 
was scored &om two-meters on a 

sweep shot by junior two-meter 
man Chris Finegold. With outside 
shooters off their mark, two-meters 
covered and the · 'six-on-five 
jammed, UCSD might have been 
lucky to have managed even four 
goals. 

Junior driver Chris Eichholz 
netted his only goal of the match 
with 2:20 remaining in the first half 
on a skip shot that scored in the 
upper-right corner of the cage. 

The Tritons fa)] to 18-8 with 
the loss, while the Lions move up 
to 12-5 Taking this week off, 
UCSD will return to action at 
Canyonview Pool on Oct. 24 for a 
noon match against No. 1 

S~ford.

secures WIn 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

Ask any member of the No. 1 
UCSD women's volleyball team if 
they monitor their individulll 
achievements and they will tell 
you that such things are not of 
much concern. Senior setter and 
all-time assists leader (4,344) 
Teresa Ohta added another mile-
stone to her career in the 3-0 
sweep over No. 3 Cal State Los 
Angeles on Oct. 15 by recording 
her thousandth dig, making her 
the fourth Triton to accomplish 
the feat. She now has 1,006 career 
digs. Ohta said she was unaware 
that she was on pace to reach the 
1,000-mark. 

"I had no idea," Ohta said. 
"One of my friends in one of ~y 
classes mentioned it to me before 
the match. I didn't really know 
about it. None of the girls really 
focus on [individual records]. We 
have much bigger goals." 

Indeed, UCSD continues to 
focus on its team goals, posting its 
12th straight win and seventh 
straight sweep over the Golden 
Eagles at their home court. Cal 
State Los Angeles head coach Bill 
Lawler, unable to find any weak-
nesses in the Tritons, came up with 
a ploy to try to distract the Tritons, 
according to Ohta and freshman 
libero Natalie Facchini - he had 
the Golden Eagles wipe down the 
court with towels after almost 
every point. 

"Their coach pulled out some 
tricks," Ohta said. "He would have 
his players wipe out the floor when 
we were starting to go on a bunch 
of runs. It would mess with us. But 
if anything, those tricks made us 
play better." 

The undeterred Tritons 
answered with a remarkable 
offensive effort against the 
Golden Eagles, hitting .442 in its 
three-game victory, 30-22, 30-18, 
30-19. Ohta engineered the 
offense with 42 assists and four 
kills of her own, while defensively 
adding 11 digs. Senior outside 
hitter Bonnie Wilson pouJlded 
Cal State Los Angeles witli 15 
kills and eight digs while junior 
outside hitter Lindsay Crandel1 
notched 10 kills and no errors to 
hit for. 769. Senior middle block-
er Katie Hogan also had no errors 
and nine kills, adding an ace and a 
solo block. Senior middle blocker 
Kendra Canape and senior out-
side hitter Stacy' Dunsmore also 
contributed with six kills each. 
Facchini also had a huge night, 
recording 18 digs in the win. 

"We actually · played much bet-
ter last night than we have in a long 
time," Ohta said. "We were more 
relaxed and after the match, we 
were happy with the way we 
played." 

UCSD came out ahead early in 
all three games, capitalizing on 
Cal State Los Angeles' service 
errors in game one to ettend its 
lead to 22-12 and shutting down 
any chance of a comeback by the 
Golden Eagles. In game two, 
Ohta guided her teammates in 
putting away 24 kills in 3 S 
attempts with no errors to hit 
.686. Crandell sealed the win for 

&e VOLLIYIMI. Pa,e '.
