Vijay Prasad, a fencing instructor affiliated with the UCSD recreation department, is under investigation for sexually 
abusing a 15-year-old student in 2005.

The student — now 21 — came forward 
on March 18 regarding the alleged sexual 
abuse that happened five years ago. In a search 
warrant document, she was quoted as saying 
she “began to feel guilty that Prasad may have 
victimized other students,” and was experiencing 

depression, anxiety and nightmares. The student, 
who was attending La Jolla Country Day School 
at the time of alleged sexual abuse, told local 
police Prasad sexually assaulted her about 50 to 
70 times in his black BMW sedan. 

She took fencing classes from Prasad, who is 
now 49 years old. According to the CBS Channel 
8 News, Prasad is currently on leave. 

Prasad was her coach in an extracurricular 
fencing club at La Jolla Country Day School 
and would often drive her to fencing classes at 
UCSD’s  Main Gym after club activities. 

According to the warrant, the student said 
that, during these trips, he would stop the car at 
a parking garage underneath the La Jolla Village 
Square shopping mall and engage in sexual 
activities with her. 

A statement released by La Jolla Country Day 

School to CBS Channel 8 News said that Prasad 
worked for the school’s fencing club, La Jolla 
Golden Blades, from 2002 to 2007.

“Country Day policy prohibits coaches from 
transporting individual students for school 
events,” the statement read. “However, club 
programs operate independently of the school 
and may allow different arrangements at the 
parents’ discretion.”

Prasad was not a university employee, but 
worked within an after-school club program 
funded by participating families, using Country 
Day and UCSD facilities.

“We can confirm that Prasad was a volunteer 
at UC San Diego and is no longer a volunteer,” 
UCSD spokesperson Christine Clark wrote in a 
statement.

Two weeks ago, the police seized a black 

BMW sedan owned by Prasad while searching 
his house in Carmel Valley. Kerry Steigerwalt, 
Prasad’s defense attorney, said in a telephone 
interview with CBS that there is no evidence to 
support the allegations.

Forensic DNA expert Mary Pierson told 
Channel 8 News that it could still be possible to 
find evidence supporting the allegations. 

“This is in a vehicle so [bodily fluids are] 
dried on the seat, and I understand there were 
many episodes of sexual activity, so there may be 
a great chance to find DNA on that seat cover,” 
Pierson said.

Prasad has not yet been charged, but 
investigations are ongoing.

Campus to See More Green Certified Buildings 
By Nicole Chan
Staff Writer

As part of the campus commitment to sustainability, UCSD is 
currently planning and constructing 19 buildings to qualify for 
Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design certification. 

“All-new construction on the UCSD campus will meet, at 
minimum, LEED Silver certification, which encourages and 
accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and 
development practices,” UCSD spokesperson Rex Graham wrote in 
an email. 

Because of this, Graham said the campuswide per-square-foot 
consumption of water has decreased over the past four years from 
56 to 53 gallons per square foot.

To acquire LEED certification, projects are evaluated on standards 
such as water efficiency — for example, water-efficient landscaping 
must reduce water usage by 50 percent. Other credits include bicycle 
storage and storm water quality control. 

According to Graham, most projects will be completed by the 
2012-13 academic year, though some will not be completed until the 
2015-16 academic year. The total cost for the 19 projects is estimated 
at $1.47 billion.

On April 19, McCarthy Building Companies started construction 
for LEED-platinum-certified Health Sciences Biomedical Research 
Facility in the School of Medicine. 

The facility will be used as a research laboratory and support 
space for new faculty in departments such as pediatrics, medical 
genomics and neurosciences. Construction, which costs $179.6 
million, is scheduled for completion in April 2013. 

Other recent LEED projects include the $42.5-million Muir 
College and $10.3-million Revelle College apartments — both 
to be completed Summer 2011 — and they already completed 
$97.7-million Village II residing north of Eleanor Roosevelt College. 

External financing and UC bonds funded $95 million of the cost 
while university housing reserves will fund the remaining $2 million. 

“On-campus housing furthers the university’s sustainability 
goals,” Graham said. “New construction incorporates the latest 

energy and water conservation technologies.”
The UC system had a $520 million state-funded facilities 

program in the 2007-08 academic year. The next year, state bond 
funding fell to $261 million and many of these funds have been 
suspended because of the budget crisis.

“More than $400 million of the $781 million in approved bond 
projects over those two fiscal years have been put on hold because 
they are dependent upon the state’s ability to obtain financing or 
sell bonds,” Graham said. “Once the state can access the market 
again, many previously approved campus facilities will resume 
construction.”

But Graham said lowered costs of construction make this an 
optimal time for development. The current cost of construction is 
possibly 30 percent lower than it was before the economic slowdown.

Study Abroad Office 
Aims to Double 
Participants to 
120,000 by 2013
By Alison Gilchrist
Contributing Writer

UCSD’s Programs Abroad Office is 
implementing an outreach plan, first begun in Fall 
2008, to increase the proportion of students who 
choose to study abroad from about 21.6 percent 
to 50 percent of the student body — more than 
doubling the number of participating students to 
approximately 12,000 in the next five years.

But despite increased advertising and emphasis 
on research and scholarship opportunities available, 
the percentage UCSD students who study abroad 
has hovered at approximately 22 percent. 

Programs Abroad Office Director Kim Burton 
said she still felt the 50-percent mark is a realistic 
goal. She cited the general decline in the economy as 
the reason these percentages have stayed constant.

“Considering the budget cuts that UC has had 
to impose, and the increased cost for students 
of attending a UC school, the fact that we are 
maintaining that percentage of students going 
abroad each year is a huge success, and validates all 
of our new efforts,” Burton said. 

According to the Programs Abroad Office, 70 
percent of students who go abroad take courses

School of  Medicine Conducts First HIV “Test and Treat” Model
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Sarah Kang
Staff Writer

Researchers from the UCSD 
School of Medicine are conducting 
the first “test and treat” model of 
HIV prevention in its “Lead the 
Way” campaign — a nine-month 
project to test adults living in the 
92103 and 92104 zip codes, which 
include Hillcrest and North Park.

The campaign is part of a project 
to demonstrate that testing and 
treating for HIV will help control 
it within a community, Medicine 
Professor Susan Little said. 

She said that if people are 
encouraged to test for HIV, HIV-
positive patients are offered 
treatment and high-risk individuals 
are tested annually, the risks 
associated with acquiring and 
transmitted HIV can be reduced. 

On June 6, researchers will 
launch a campaign in which testers 
from UCSD’s Antiviral Research 
Center will visit randomly-selected 
residential areas and offer finger-

prick testing either in people’s 
homes or in mobile testing rooms. 
The results will be delivered on the 
spot. There will also be tests at a 
center in Hillcrest. People who don’t 
want to be tested can take a survey. 

Researchers will ask everyone 
— regardless of whether they are 
likely to contract HIV— to see if 
they will test for HIV if the test is 
made readily available. Those who 
are HIV positive will be treated with 
antiretroviral medications, which 
treat retroviruses like HIV. 

“What we’re trying to do is 
move HIV testing out of a high-risk 
environment in which people get 
tested only if they think they’re in 
a high-risk category,” Little said, 
“[Then we] figure out a way to make 
HIV testing generally acceptable 
within the communities we live 
in independent of risk, so that 
we can help identify people who 
are infected and unaware of their 
infection status.”

Little hopes the information 
will reveal the biggest barriers and 

motivators that make people get 
tested for HIV.

These barriers to testing include 
inefficient programs, unaffordable 
treatment and concerns over fear 
and discrimination. 

Potential motivators for people 
to get tested include easier testing 
strategies that reduce the anxiety 
caused by waiting for results, or 
home-testing to promote anonymity 
and security. 

“The goal is to try and have 
a representative sample within 
the community from which we 
can generalize HIV statistics and 
willingness to participate in this 
community,” Little said.

The current phase of the one-
year “test-and-treat” study focuses 
on encouraging people to get 
tested, and treatment will follow 
after researchers learn about the 
motivators and barriers to HIV 
testing.

“We want everyone represented 
in this study so that we can make 
predictable estimates of what the 

HIV prevalence and incidence are in 
the 92103 [and] 92104 community,” 
Little said. 

She added that the progress in 
developing a vaccine is slow, so 
researchers want to demonstrate 
that they can slow the spread 
of HIV without a vaccine.

Office Wants to Increase Study Abroad Scholarships
in their major and most expect to 
receive major credit for these classes. 
About 51.4 percent of the 1,010 
alumni that the Programs Abroad 
Office surveyed between 2008 and 
2010 felt that studying abroad was 
influential in their career choice, and 
39 percent felt that the experience 
was beneficial in obtaining their first 
job. 

“After studying and interning 
abroad in London, I learned that I 
would like to work in an international 
company after I graduate,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior Christine 
Lai wrote in an email. “I hope to be 
back in London.”

But some students have not yet 
seriously looked into studying abroad 
due to financial decisions or other 
factors.

“I feel that I don’t have the time or 
money to look into studying abroad,” 

Thurgood Marshall College junior 
Hanna Nakamura said. “I already 
have my hands full studying here.”

The Programs Abroad Office 
also wants to increase the pool of 
dedicated study abroad scholarship 
funds from both Pell Grants and 
private scholarships, such as the 
Benjamin Gilman Study Abroad 
Scholarship. 

“The scholarship pool has held 
steady, but there are more students 
going abroad,” Burton said. “So it’s 
therefore more competitive.”

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has 
publicly supported the plan. 

“It is an ambitious goal and an 
important one,” UCSD spokesperson 
Christine Clark said. “We have 
always encouraged students to study 
abroad because it fosters knowledge, 
skills, cultural awareness and global 
citizenship.”

In addition to encouraging 50 
percent of the student body to study 

abroad, Fox wants to increase the 
interaction of returning students with 
students who have not yet studied 
abroad. A plan proposed by the 
PAO, called “Internationalization 
at Home,” would encourage 
communication among returning 
international students who are 
interested in studying internationally 
and professors. 

For example, students will be 
asked to share their experiences in 
various classes throughout the year.

“Some of the strategies would 
include working with faculty and 
other partners throughout the 
campus to encourage them to tap 
into the global knowledge and 
experiences of the international 
students,” Burton said. “We want 
to weave their experiences into the 
classroom experience.”

Economist Kenneth Simonson, 
San Diego lost more than 26,000 
construction jobs in the past 
three years. The county’s current 
unemployment rate is above 10 
percent. 

“These projects will bring much-
needed work to a suffering industry 
while creating structures that will 
deliver value for decades,” Simonson 
said.

certified.

There are 28 LEED projects at 

UCSD, five of which are certified 
buildings. 

Across all universities in the 
United States, there are 4,115 LEED 
projects and 999 are certified.

The Sustainability Resource 
Center is the fifth building at UCSD 
to achieve LEED certification by the

I’m used to saying ‘no’ on Library Walk. To Kripsy Kremes for Haiti, to undercover Christian 
pizza parties, to Spring rush (though 
frat boys don’t often ask in the first 
place), to marsupial-hatted bros ped-
dling the worst in college journalism 
since 1981 and, most frequently, to 
an indignant troupe of twentysome-
things who want to know why I — of 
all people! — don’t have five minutes 
for gay marriage. 

So last week, in approaching the 
mobile blood bank stationed just 
outside the Student Health Center, 
I had my standard responses at 
the ready: “Sorry,” I might say to 
the flock of sorority girls boasting 
“Party with Pi Phi” tank tops and a 
hand-drawn “Donate YOUR Tiger 
Blood” poster, “still gay.” Or I might, 
in a gesture of greater friendliness, 
slow down to offer a polite grin. (I 
am, after all, still gunning for one of 
those tank tops.)

In any case, I was spared the 
decision. Behind the table were no 
philanthropy-loving sorority girls/
Charlie Sheen interns to behold, and 
in place of the Tiger Blood poster 
was one that read, in giant black let-
tering: “Know Your Status — Free 
HIV Rapid Testing.” 

There were, unsurprisingly, vir-
tually no takers at the time that I 
passed by. I’m not sure whether to 
chalk that up to a general culture of 
avoidance on Library Walk or to the 
popular belief that HIV is only an 
issue in the developing world and 
the gay community. 

Maybe I’m assuming too much, 
and those passing were no more 
cognizant of the blood bank than of 
student orgs hawking Jamba Juice 
fliers or fried rice. Maybe for some, 
it only takes a quarter’s practice to 
tune out all solicitors, no matter how 
colorful the banner or aggressive the 
plea for attention. 

Still, I can’t help but think that 
in this case, they should take notice. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, one in four 
Americans living with HIV doesn’t 
know he’s infected. And at the risk 
of echoing one of a thousand public 
service announcements, it’s a helluva 
lot scarier to live with the virus 
without knowing than to be aware 
of it; while many infected people go 
years before requiring medication, 
early treatment is crucial in keeping 
healthy. 

Of course, there are plenty of 
reasons people don’t get tested in the 
first place, not the least of which is 
the stigma of being perceived as the 
kind of person who requires testing. 
It’s a ridiculous designation, because 
in reality, everyone who’s ever had 
sex — whether in a frat-house closet 
with an acquaintance of 20 minutes 
or in blissful union with a high 
school sweetheart in the backseat 
— is exactly the kind of person who 
should get tested.

Plus, the rapid test offered on 
Library Walk last week takes the 
anxiety out of waiting for results:

The City University of  New York’s faculty may worry that its new transfer policy 
will sacrifice quality, but efficiency doesn’t necessarily come at the cost of  excellence.

By Madeline Mann 
Associate Opinion Editor

In order to streamline the transfer process, the City University of New York has proposed a plan to 
make more community college credits 
transferable by limiting its general 
education offerings (which vary by 
campus). 

The plan consists of cutting general 
education requirements from 51 to 36 
hours (the equivalent of about 76.5 
and 54 UC quarter units, respectively), 
with an additional six GE hours left 
to be taken at the four-year university. 
The proposed plan hopes to improve 
transfer graduation rates and prevents 
transfer students from squandering 
undue sums of state funding. 

Their plans to allow more GE 
requirements to cross over from com-
munity colleges to four year colleges 
will likely be successful in boosting 
transfer graduation rates. 

Under current circumstances, 51.7 
percent of CUNY transfer students in 
2009 graduated within five years — a 
result of varying graduation require-
ments within the CUNY system. 

Helping students make a smooth 
transition from community college to 
a four-year university is a challenge for 
all state university systems. According 
to October 2010 CUNY reports, 
transfer students spend approximately 
$72 million in tax dollars annually on 
courses that eventually lead them to 
far exceed the 120 units necessary for 
graduation.

California addressed this problem 
by instituting a Transfer Admission 
Guarantee between all California 
community colleges and California 
public universities. To transfer to 
UCSD, for instance, students must 
meet the required 3.5 GPA minimum 
and complete the required UC English 
and math courses by the spring of 
their transfer year. Most UC transfer 
students enter at the junior level after 
completing 60 semester units and GE 

requirements. 
Though the general requirements 

for UC transfer students are straight-
forward, they don’t address the main 
issue for CUNY transfers — taking 
non-GE courses that will transfer and 
help them finish a degree in time. The 
California government helps students 
determine which classes to take through 
an interactive website found at http://
www.assist.org, which allows students to 
check their com-
munity college 
courses to see if 
they are accepted 
for credit at each 
of the CSU and 
UC campuses. 
The website 
allows students to 
input their cam-
pus and major 
to help decide 
which classes to 
take — and, more 
importantly, what 
is transferable to 
other universities. 

At UCSD, 
71 percent of 
transfer students are able to take all of 
the classes they need to earn a degree 
in three years or less, according to the 
UCSD Spring 2010 Transfer Update. 

Despite the apparent boon to effi-
ciency, however, the CUNY proposal 
has been met with criticism. CUNY 
professors, such as Scott D. Dexter and 
Emily S. Tai, of the Computer Science 
and History departments, respectively, 
claim that because the faculty won’t 
have enough say in the required cur-
riculum, the quality of education is 
likely to suffer. Some administrators 
also say that CUNY is running the risk 
of becoming a degree mill, with the 
goal of sparing state funding outweigh-
ing that of educating its students.

In response, the CUNY faculty sen-

ate proposed an alternate plan to allow 
for 30 credits of general education and 
an additional 16 credits from four-year 
universities, which will add nearly a 
semester to students’ general education 
requirements. This plan will address 
the faculty’s worry that community 
college classes will fail to adequately 
prepare students for university, which 
may lead to poor grades and a devalued 
degree. However, this alternate plan 

makes it difficult for stu-
dents to focus on their 
major requirements — 
and almost impossible 
to double major.

But according to the 
UCSD Student Research 
and Information Office, 
53.2 percent of the 
transfer students who 
graduated in 2010 
had a GPA of 3.0 or 
higher. The fact that 
the majority of UC 
transfer students were 
able to handle the uni-
versity course rigor and 
maintain a high GPA 
suggests that CUNY 

students may well be able to manage 
the same.

Transfer students and the state 
are currently overspending on classes 
that, in the end, are not recognized by 
their transfer universities. Clearly, it is 
essential for a clear dialogue to exist 
between community colleges and four-
year universities.

It is the state’s responsibility to 
ensure efficiency in public higher 
education; there’s little point in a com-
munity college system that doesn’t 
adequately prepare students for the 
classes required of them at a four-year 
university.

Bridging the Gap

According to October 
2010 CUny reports, 
transfer students 
spend $72 million in 
tax dollars annually 
on courses that 
eventually lead them 
to far exceed the 120 
units necessary for 
graduation.

Dear Editor,
   Last month, four individuals were 
pulled into the ocean, and one of them 
has yet to be found. He happened to 
be a UCSD student, someone I was 
very close to. He was also my room-
mate. His name is Bovey Zhang.

I put aside a reoccurring impres-
sion to check up on him, and tell him 
to be safe around the water. Eventually 
I texted Bovey. But I was too late, for 
the ocean had taken him in hours 
earlier that morning. My hesitation 
has caused me much regret. A few 
days later, I told some friends, “I do 
not know how I could handle the loss 
of another friend. Not now anyway. It 
would be devastating to me.” The fol-
lowing morning, a colleague of mine 
took his life. His name was Louis 
Nguyen. I cannot describe to you the 
pain that had been tearing me apart. 
But my purpose in this message is not 
to receive sympathy, but to express a 
brief message that I hope you take to 
heart.

You don’t realize how much some-
one means to you until after they are 
literally robbed from you. So often I 
see friendships ruined by arguments 
instigated over the most inconsequen-
tial matters. I see people sorrowing 
over unsatisfactory grades or other 
unachieved worthwhile pursuits. I do 
not mean to marginalize such tribula-
tions. But I’ve come to understand 
that however ostensibly beneficial or 
essential such points of disagreements, 
academics or other admirable aspira-
tions may appear to be, and neces-
sary to suit our immediate desires, 
frequently they are irrelevant in the 
eternal perspective, and merely details 
in the pursuit of happiness. Once they 
encumber our ability to enjoy the 
fruits of our friendships, our progress 
towards the ultimate goal becomes 

meaningless. And that ultimate goal is 
happiness.

Someone once said, “The today 
you spent so wastefully away, is the 
tomorrow that the friend who died 
yesterday wanted so desperately 
to have.” Life is short and slippery. 
Don’t waste your time being angry 
or offended, for although such emo-
tions can be provoked by others, their 
development lies entirely within the 
discretion of each individual. Anger is, 
in a sense, the cousin to resentment; 
the only energy-draining and time-
wasting emotion equivalent to culti-
vating anger is that of taking offense. 
For these emotions don’t build any-
thing, nor do they solve anything, 
but they have the capacity to destroy 
everything. 

Let your friends and families know 
how much they mean to you today. 
Because if some tragic accident hap-
pens, no amount of sorrow or tears 
can bring a loved one back once death 
has taken its bitter toll.

UCSD has suffered a loss of two 
great individuals. If you could search 
all of UCSD, perhaps you could only 
find a handful that are as kind and 
selfless as Bovey Zhang. If Bovey 
could tell me one last thing, he would 
tell me to be happy. And if I could tell 
him one last thing, it would be that I 
loved him.

Bovey Zhang, I love you.

—Austin Kim

HIV Stigma Overshadows Widespread Need for Testing
tors offer counseling if necessary,

sex ed review), the 
whole process lasts 
no longer than the

As long as 
that stigma exists, 
though, the blood 
bank line won’t be able to hold a 
candle to Burger King’s. I get it: The 
fear of being spotted underneath a 
“Know Your Status” banner by a frat 

brother or a professor or — God 
forbid, with the kind of bad luck 

that’s meant only to 
strike on hour-long 
TV dramas, a love 
interest — is prob-
ably enough to keep 
anyone away. 

The School of 
Medicine’s trying to 
work around that 
stigma. 

UCSD research-
ers have launched 
the “Lead the Way” 

campaign — a nine-month effort 
targeting residents of Hillcrest and 
North Park. The initiative aims to 
offer confidential HIV testing to 

as many in the 92103 and 92104 
zip codes as possible; starting in 
June, the campaign will even offer 
an option for door-to-door mobile 
testing, allowing those interested 
to take a 10-minute rapid test in 
the privacy of their own home. (In 
other words: No risk of a chance 
run-in with the babe who sits three 
rows ahead of you in MMW). 

Until then, the Student Health 
Center offers confidential HIV test-
ing for free for all covered under 
SHIP; for those without coverage, 
it’s around $10. 

There’s no need to divulge why 
you’re there: Just walk into the 
nurse’s clinic and request “counsel-
ing.”

QUICKTAKES  Los Angeles Police Department Truancy Sweeps
Truancy Sweeps Detract from Education

The LAPD is reforming its procedure of ticketing stu-dents who are en route to school. 
Police will now abstain from “truancy sweeps” for the 

first hour of school and will begin to ask students why 
they are running late to class, instead of ticketing them 
without question.

While the now-banned policy had the right intentions 
— the idea was that ticketing students would scare them 
straight — it lost all merit in practice. 

Tickets, starting at around $200 and escalating dra-
matically for repeat offenders, cost students steep fines. 
Some students reported that the ticketing process itself 
could even take up another estimated 45 minutes of lost 
class time. 

As if those delays weren’t enough, the students who 
had to attend traffic court also missed a full day of 
school for the proceedings. Clearly, the ticketing process 
detracted from the overall intention of the program: to 
get kids back in school.

If safety and crime is truly the biggest issue, police 
should be more concerned with being a safe escort to 
school for students. 

Jorge Villegas, assistant to the LAPD Chief, said that 
police are directed to take students not involved in crime 
to their school or to the nearest Attendance Improvement 
Center.

Juvenile crime most often occurs in the daylight 
hours, so keeping youth in school should be a top prior-
ity.

 By asking students if they have legitimate excuses and 
only conducting curfew sweeps in high-crime areas, the 
LAPD is making its truancy policy both fairer and more 
narrowly targeted.

— Alex Pakzad
Staff Writer

The LAPD has prudently altered its truancy policy, which has overwhelmingly affected students of color in the 
past. A full 88 percent of the 47,000 tickets issued from 2004 
to 2009 were issued to Latinos or blacks — and of the 13,000 
curfew tickets issued on school grounds, not one went to a 
white student. 

Instead of ticketing those students who are late to class, 
officers will now ask students if 
they have a legitimate reason for 
not being in class and focus more 
on getting students to school on 
time. Furthermore, police will no 
longer target students once they are 
on school grounds — leaving it up 
to school authorities to take appro-
priate action.

Understandably, students should 
get to school on time, but the for-
mer method (truancy sweeps lead-
ing to expensive tickets) was based 
on fear of police. 

African American and Latino 
students make up 74 percent of 
the population in the LAUSD, but 
received 85 percent of the truancy 
violation tickets from 2005-2009. 

Of course, this new policy is 
not perfect — it could benefit from 
an additional school-based program that addresses the root 
causes of truancy — but that doesn’t concern the LAPD. For 
now, having the LAPD cut back on ticketing students for tar-
diness is the best possible solution. 

— Saad Asad
Senior Staff Writer

While the LAPD’s scaled-back efforts certainly make for fairer policy, neither system addresses the root cause. 
The original strategy wasn’t merely intended to encourage 

school attendance in the Los Angeles Unified School District; it 
was pitched as a way to keep students from committing crimes 
during the school day. 

Supporters of the new policy introduce indicators that the 
crime rates increase when there are no sweeps. 

Both policies do little to address the 
root cause of truancy. The problem runs 
far deeper than a few disengaged stu-
dents — it’s a public education system 
that falls short in offering guidance to 
those that need it most at a young age. 

Targeting truants when they’re 
already 16 or 17 probably does little to 
address those shortcomings. Mentoring 
programs are necessary, as students need 
support rather than discouragement. 

Los Angeles Unified School District 
is currently using a three-tiered strategy 
to combat truancy by working at the 
base level . They’re working to provide 
a more positive climate at schools by 
creating alternative education pro-
grams such as the national “Big Picture 
Learning” approach, and launching a 
media campaign to encourage kids to 

improve their attendance and stress to the parents the destructive 
effects of truancy on their student’s education. 

As of 2011, the LAUSD dropout rate stands at 30 percent. 
Clearly the best possible solution to this pressing issue is to focus 
on school mentorship — not LAPD arrests.

We all know La Jolla is no college town. Among the beachside mansions and six-figure 
car dealers, it’s hard to find a place on a student budget — not to mention somewhere to 

satisfy our thirst for entertainment (plus, you know, booze). 
Enter Pacific Beach, La Jolla’s beach bum neighbor — just 15 minutes down the I-5 south 

from campus. For the price of a Costa Verde single (most places cost around $1,300 for two 
bedrooms, though prices rise closer to the ocean) you can find a place just steps from the sand. 

You may be guzzling gas up and down the I-5 every day, but that’s the price you pay for some of the best nightlife 
in San Diego. Thrift shops and bars litter the main drag, Garnet Avenue. Whether you want to chug tequila shots with 
frat boys at Typhoon Saloon or invest in a new bong, everything is only a few minutes away — and for the morning-
after hangover, Broken Yolk is just a short stagger down the street. 

If tribal-tatted bros and hippies are too much for you, opt for a place in the quieter areas of Crown Point or north-
ern Pacific Beach. Mission Bay may not have the same allure, but prices are cheaper, and you’ll hear a whole lot less 
Pitbull from passing car stereos.

Regents La Jolla is quite different from 
its high end La Jollan counterparts. Unlike at the 
other fancier complexes that sit on Regents Road, hosting par-
ties at Regents La Jolla is doable, but frustrating — non-UCSD 
student tenants complain of the loud frat parties, which paper 
thin walls don’t do a very good job of muffling. And safety is an 
issue, as tenants often leave gates open, inviting burglary and 
vandalism. Management is sluggish, and the apartments are in 
dire need of renovation. But Regents La Jolla isn’t completely 
a lost cause. Located close to 201, 30 and 101 bus stops, living 
at the complex will give you easy access to pretty much every-
where. Starting at $1450 for the one-bedroom apartments, and 
$1850 for the two-bedroom ones, the apartments come with 
useful amenities such as microwaves and dishwashers. And for 
those of you that are attached to your furry pals, residents can 
register up to two pets, cats or dogs, per apartment.

The classic community amenities are also there — a movie 
theater, pool, a spa and a gym with free recreational classes will 
give you something to do if the halls are filled with the noise of 
that frat party you weren’t invited to.

Chances are, Regents La Jolla won’t be your first choice. But 
if you find yourself with nowhere else to go, lock your car, bring 
some earplugs, and don’t expect luxury.

Not for nothing is Costa Verde often the default go-to for students 
looking to live off campus — the complex offers convenience (though 
not much else). Located a few minutes from the Arriba shuttle and 
various bus stops, and a short bike ride — or 30-minute walk — from 
campus, these student-filled apartments are perfect for the carless coed 
who just wants to get to class on time. 

In fact, for those living at Costa Verde, it might be better to be 
carless. 

The complex is notoriously stingy about parking spots; 
even those lucky enough to duke it out with three room-
mates over one spot have to brave a winding underground 
garage like the seventh level of hell, complete with enor-
mous pillars at every corner that make maneuvering a 
nightmare. (And there’s barely any street parking either. 
Expect tickets that will offset any rent “deal” you wrangle.)

The prices are average — expect to pay about $1700 for a 
two-room or around $1400 for the one-room-plus-loft combo 

— and the barebones residence also features creaky old elevators 
and high trash bills. 

But the complex does include a gym, pool and sauna, and is rela-
tively party-friendly, thanks to the fact that almost all the other resi-
dents are UCSD students too. 

— ANGELA CHEN 
EDITOR IN cHIEf

Trieste, located on Mahlia Avenue between 
a luxury retirement home and a few quaint 
condos, isn’t the showiest complex on the block.  
Despite a fairly new kitchen that’s nice for the 
budding chef and in-house washer and dryer, 
it’s difficult to furnish rooms because they are 
bordered by oddly-shaped polygonal walls so 
thin that you can hear which song your neigh-
bors are playing Guitar Hero with. 

Even more annoying is the complex’s park-
ing: Tandem parking lots (people parking one 
in front of the other) lock you in, and the 
shoddy automatic gate doesn’t help. 

The complex sports a pool, Jacuzzi and gym, 
but little can make up for the price, which runs 
upwards of $2,200 for a two bedroom/one loft 
apartment, with rent increasing every time you 
extend your lease. 

Ultimately, Trieste isn’t worth the money for 
a small space that you can’t even tour when you 
make your visit.  

Though the complex is close to both the 
Arriba and Nobel, you might just find out 
that living along La Jolla Village Drive, where 
you can hear ambulances and large trucks 
vibrating the floors of your room, isn’t all it’s 
cracked up to be.

LA JOLLA 

REgENTS ROADCosta Verde’s quieter and lesser-
known cousin, La Regencia — located 

10 minutes from campus by shuttle — 
isn’t exactly party central.  Community 

events are for children and senior citizens, so 
the atmosphere is generally akin to a Geisel-esque 
calm. 

If the old home vibe doesn’t deter you, La 
Regencia has spacious rooms that come with a 
washer, dryer and a furnished kitchen, complete 
with fridge and microwave. Amenities include a 
small gym, a racquetball court and two pools. 

Unfortunately, living here can get a bit pricey 
— a double will cost you just under $500, and 
though La Regencia provides each apartment with 
two parking spaces, you’ll need to apply for a $25 
sticker.

What you lose in price you make up for in 
convenience — La Regencia is near the last Arriba 
shuttle stop, which is best to grab at the half hour 
mark to avoid the pre-classes rush.   

It’s also right besides Vons, so there’s never an 
excuse not to whip up a batch of brownies on a 
particularly boring day in the complex.

Pitched as a modern, uptown alternative to the endless succession of cookie-cutter UTC complexes, La Jolla Crossroads purports to deliver 
big where its neighbors fall short: in ambiance, in amenities — and, according to the leasing office website, in contemporary art (of which it 

is said to possess an “unprecedented collection”). 
In reality, Crossroads isn’t so much a hedonist’s haven as a massive, character-free expanse of tract buildings right next to the I-805 — 

though it’s also both newer and more affordable than most of the competition. And while there may be no free-flowing vino and fresh 
strawberries out at the pool, there are plenty of creature comforts to behold: in-unit washers and dryers, new appliances and more than 
enough walk-in closet space for all the modern art that just won’t suit the living room walls.

There are, however, a couple steep drawbacks. Commuting to campus is all but out of the question without a car, unless you don’t 
mind the 25-minute trek to the bus stops at the far end of Westfield Mall. You can also forget about having guests for your housewarming 

rager — there’s no street parking, and guest spots are a rare commodity on the weekends. But even if $700 a month can’t buy the decadent 
Mediterranean lifestyle that the management’s trying to peddle, it still gets you a single in one of the cleaner, better-appointed complexes 

near campus.

North Park is a college hipster’s wet 
dream — indie dive bars sans Pacific 

Beach’s juicehead frat boys (Live 
Wire’s bartenders are a particularly 

jovial bunch), cross-hatched with 
uppercrust restaurants, uptempo 
gay clubs and hole-in-the-wall 
diner gems. 

Best of all, University Avenue 
— North Park’s main drive 

— is shared with sibling ‘hood 
Hillcrest, which is home to a simi-

lar mix of late-night eateries (Jimmy 
Wong’s Golden Dragon is a great 3 a.m. 
find) and bars — giving locals two awesome 
nearby boroughs to choose from for the 
price of one.

Not that the plethora of options comes 
cheap — inexpensive housing is hard to 
find (though you’ll have better luck than in 
Hillcrest, where the UCSD Medical Center 
has upped rent prices considerably) with 
rooms costing upwards of $700 a pop. And 
you’ll have to search to find a pad south 
of University Avenue — the last couple of 
blocks near Landis are a bit sketchy.

Commuting is a bigger hassle — unless 
you make the ambitious daily trek to the 
Hillcrest shuttle stop, public transport is a 
non-option, leaving a substantial 20-minute 
drive between you and your 8 a.m. physics 
class at Center Hall. If you don’t mind the 
early start, then take a pass on the Pacific 
Beach’s wifebeaters and opt for North Park’s 
horn-rimmed glasses — the lack of fist-
pumping bros alone will be worth it.

NORTH 
pARk 

Odds are you haven’t heard of Pines La Jolla, since most UCSD students live in Costa Verde, 
International Gardens and Crossroads. 

But it’s more than worth taking a look: Situated on the corner of Regents Road and Nobel Drive, 
Pines is conveniently located right next to the first Arriba stop, ensuring that its residents rarely 
have to wait for the next shuttle because the last was overpacked with sweaty coeds. The Superloop 
also makes a stop there and with the seven-minute drive to campus, residents are spoiled for 
transportation choice.  While residents wait, they can take a five-minute stroll to Vons and Tapioca 
Express down the street to grab some grub.

Felling stressed? The complex has two pools, hot tubs and a sauna to get you through your 
midterm blues. Apartments are privately owned and priced, which means you can find a pad to fit 
most pocket books — for anywhere from $1,300 to $1,700.

But Pines isn’t without its faults — most of the people living at the complex are families and 
senior citizens who don’t kindly to late-night ragers. And having friends over is a pain —

residents have to physically let friends’ cars into guest parking, which is practically non-existent. 
Worse, the thin walls also let neighbors know when your girlfriend’s over, making the walk of 

shame to the parking lot seem longer than the trek from ERC to Sixth College.

LA JOLLA

REgENTS ROAD

Located on the corner of 
Lebon and Nobel Drives, rough-
ly 10 minutes from campus, La 
Scala boasts pool and spa access 
(quite publicly in the center of 
the complex), a small gym (look 
forward to waiting around 15 
minutes for one of six machines) 
and free printing (if the error 
button isn’t lit up, anyway). 

Shove two people in a spa-
cious room and you’ll pay around 
$400 a month, or otherwise opt 
for a luxuriously sized single for 
about $750. But while La Scala 
does offer plenty of creature com-
forts, these one-to-two- bedroom 
pads lack good air ventilation; 
carpets feel perpetually damp, 
and small black dots of mold 
creep onto the bathroom ceiling 
after a hot shower.

Luckily, the parking situa-
tion helps make up for the wear 
and tear. Each apartment gets 
two reserved spots, and there are 
hoards of green visitor spaces for 
friends, who can be buzzed in 
easily. Best of all, Ralphs, Trader 
Joe’s, Whole Foods and Vons are 
all a five-minute drive away.

But the complex, apparently 
most popular among antisocial 
bookworms, crazy cat ladies and 
creepy guys that never speak, 
is devoid of any social life — 
unless you count sporadic beer 
pong tournaments downstairs 
(Los Primos is close enough for 
a drunchies-sating stumble, and 
open ’til 1 a.m.).

Conveniently located near 
the Lebon and Nobel Drive 
shuttle stop, Nobel Court resi-
dents are within walking dis-
tance of La Jolla Village Square, 
which houses Cost Plus World 
Market, Trader Joe’s, Ralphs and 
the AMC Movie Theater, as well 
as Shops at La Jolla Village, 
which boasts such bourgeois 
delights as Sprinkles Cupcakes 
and Whole Foods. 

The complex is a great 
choice for those without cars. 
Commuting to campus via 
shuttle takes a scant 10 minutes, 
and because the shuttle stop by 
Nobel Court is the first on the 
Nobel shuttle, you don’t  need 
to wait long for a seat. MTS Bus 
Routes 201 and 202 also stop 
close by, offering easy access 
to the expansive Westfield 
Shopping Center and a host of 
neighboring complexes along 
the way. 

Rent is a bit high relative to 
others nearby. A two-bedroom, 
two-bathroom apartment goes 
for around $1875 monthly plus 
utilities, but you get what you 
pay for: Each unit includes 
access to a pool, volleyball 
court, gym and also has an in-
unit washer and dryer. 

The complex offers clean 
spaces, reliable and friendly 
staff and affable neighbors, 
which to some, are worth the 
steep cost of living. 

Many tenants are students, 
though there are also plenty of 
small families and retired cou-
ples. As a result, the complex 
stays quiet most of the time — a 
comfortable alternative to the 
library, yes, but not much of a 
host for a Friday-night kick-
back.

Mention La Jolla Southpointe to most and you’ll get a blank stare — a fitting 
response, given the hidden mystique of the Southpointe townhouse complex 

located off of Via Mallorca, nearly a mile from Ralphs. 
The area is a bizarre mixture of UCSD students, families with children and 

uppity retirees, which makes throwing parties a little dicey, though the loca-
tion still has its perks: The complex is a 10- to 15- minute walk from La Jolla 
Village Square and its plethora of dining options, ideal for a late-night trip 
to Ralphs or a stumble home from TGI Friday’s or El Torito. The townhomes 

themselves are spacious and well-kept — although a tad on the expensive side, 
with a three-bedroom unit likely to cost $2200 a month or more.

 If you’re unwilling to drive or bike the necessary 15 minutes to campus, com-

muting can be touch-and-go — especially since the closest bus stop (located nearly 
a mile away, off Gilman Drive) is the last stop on the Superloop route before campus 
and is notorious for being passed over by overflowing buses at peak hours, dooming 
long lines of students to being late for class.

Another major drawback is the uptight homeowners association, which takes 
quick offense to cars temporarily parked in the street in front of townhouses. The 
board also is known to impose the kind of frivolous, image-conscious restrictions 
typical to high-strung suburbia. (Word to the wise: Don’t leave your surfboard out 
on the balcony.)

If you’re des-
perate to escape the 
over-sanitized La Jolla bubble, 
downtown San Diego has enough 
grime and crazy homeless dudes 
to turn any pampered princess 
into a Minaj-esque hood rat. 

At the heart of the Gaslamp 
district, concert venues (both 
18+ and 21+) and theatres are 
(seemingly) on every street cor-
ner, with bars diced conveniently 
in between. Make the most of it: 
Before hitting up a Wu Tang con-
cert at the ghetto fabulous 4th and 
B, knock back a couple (or five) 
$1 sake bombs during RA Sushi’s 
happy hour from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.

But hood (ironically) comes 
with a price and you’ll need a 
heap of green and gold to back 
your new swagger — a studio 
apartment will set you back a 
staggering $1,500 (though feel 
free to rage like a rap star once 
you’ve nailed down your apart-
ment — most tenants aren’t fussy 
about noise levels.) The com-
mute won’t help your pocketbook 
either — downtown is a grueling 
20-minute drive from campus, 
and public transport is an unre-
alistic option (it takes nearly an 
hour and a half to get to school 
by bus.)  And say goodbye to 
late-night food runs —what La 
Jolla lacks in character it makes 
up for in an abundance of safe, 
nearby food joints to satisfy an 
onset of ravenous munchies — a 
convenience that downtown is 
sadly devoid of.

But if you’ve got the dough 
to blow — and any real pimp 
would — then do it big in Little 
Italy, where quaint coffee shops 
and eateries are more likely to be 
dorky college-kid friendly — at 
least until your backhand builds 
up a little muscle.

Coming home to your apartment in La 
Jolla’s International Gardens can be like 

coming home to a resort. It’s equipped 
with a heated pool, bubbly Jacuzzi 
and an Internet café that serves 
complimentary coffee while you 
furiously finish writing that narra-
tive for your LTWR100 class. The 

facilities also include a well-sized 
fitness center and a billiard-equipped 

clubhouse.  
One-bedroom apartments start at 

$1295, two-bedroom ones at  $1785. However, 
International Garden’s management demands 
financial preparedness; if you don’t make three 
times the rent per month, you have to pay six 
months rent in advance — not the friendliest of 
measures for penny-pinched college students 
that don’t have the luxury of daddy’s credit 
card.

Like most places in La Jolla, International 
Gardens will not be where you decide to hold 
a raging kickback for your friends due to the 
paper-thin walls and the regular demands for 
quiet (try not to sneeze after 10 p.m.), but for 
the studious, the place ideal.

International Garden’s location on Lebon 
makes it close to both bus routes; Vons and 
Whole Foods nearby are a convenient plus for 
the student that’s adjusting to life without din-
ing dollars. 

Top it off with the helpful maintenance, and 
students that have somewhere else to go on a 
Friday night could find plenty to like about 
International Gardens.           — MINA NILCHIAN

BaseBall roundup — eight straight Wins

April 22
UC San Diego 15, Academy of Art 1

In his first game in over three weeks, first baseman KC 
Rentfro led an offensive barrage that saw 10 Tritons get hits. 

Rentfro went three-for-three with four RBI, redshirt 
freshman Nick La Face was three-for-six with four runs and 
two RBI, as the Tritons dominated the Urban Knights from 
start to finish. La Face and Rentfro each went deep in the 
game. The damage could have been worse, as UCSD left 
nine runners on base in the game.

Senior Triton ace Tim Shibuya (8-3) was perfect through 
four innings, and pitched five innings to pick up the win. 
Academy of Art had just three hits in the game. 

April 23
UC San Diego 12, Academy of Art 2

The Tritons continued their bombardment of the Urban 
Knights to win their ninth straight game. 

Academy of Art put up a run in the top of the first to take 
a surprise lead, but UCSD responded right away with a run 
in the bottom half and five more in the second. Senior Grant 
Bauer was three-for-four with three RBI, and redshirt fresh-

man Scott Liske went two-for-three with two RBI. Liske and 
senior catcher Michael Benton launched their first home 
runs of the season in the game. 

With the game comfortably in hand, the Triton used 22 
players in the game, and used every pitcher on the roster 
over the two-game series. Senior Guido Knudson (6-3) was 
credited with the win, despite pitching only three innings as 
the Tritons gave innings to their bullpen. 

The Tritons are now 30-12 overall, and remain in second 
place in the conference after two non-league games.

“I can’t say enough about the job our guys did that 
haven’t been getting a lot of playing time,” head coach Dan 
O’Brien said. “They’ve been working their tails off in prac-
tice. In a short two games we got a lot done, and a lot of that 
is from the guys coming off the bench.”

 The Tritons have scored 45 runs in their last three 
games. 

“I think our guys have been playing great baseball,” 
O’Brien said. “Our practices have been very intense, but also 
very short and to the point. We’re getting our work in and 
staying fresh.” 

The Tritons will head north to face conference leader 
Chico State next weekend in a four-game series starting on

a solo home run by UCSD freshman 
catcher Caitlin Brown in the fourth.

The Tritons put the game out of 
reach in the seventh, registering six 
runs on four hits, with seniors Woofter 
and Rhiannon Ousley both recording 
two RBI.

April 22 (GAme 2)
UC San Diego 2, Cal State East Bay 1

With help from around the confer-
ence, the Tritons clinched their first-
ever CCAA regular season title with 
a narrow win in the second game of 
the series.

UCSD came into the series needing 
to win three of four games to clinch 
the title. The second- and third-place 
teams, however, dropped a game apiece 
in their doubleheaders, and the 2-1 win 
gave the top spot to the Tritons.

Neither team got on board until 
the fourth inning, when Cal State East 
Bay pitcher Heidi McAllister hit a solo 
home run to centerfield.  

Down 1-0, the Tritons rallied in the 
sixth inning to pull out the win. With 
two outs and Romero on third and 
freshman Emily McQuaid — pinch-
running for Brown — on second, fresh-
man Charly Swanberg singled to right 
center for two RBI.

Triton freshman starter Jennifer 
Manuel pitched four and two-third 
innings and gave up one run on four 
hits, but Gaito (24-2) got the win with 
two and one-third innings of two-hit 
relief.

April 23 (GAme 1)
Cal State East Bay 11, UC San Diego 
3 (6 innings)

The Pioneers recorded four home 
runs in the 3-11 victory over the 
Tritons.  

Cal State East Bay recorded four 
runs off a pair of two-run home runs 
within the first two innings. The 
Tritons brought the score to 4-3 with 
RBI from Romero and Swanberg, as 
seniors Katrin Gabriel and Lesovsky 
came across to score. But the Pioneers 
put the game away in the fourth, with a 
grand slam by Nikki Freiberg.

Manuel (2-4) took a tough loss, 
allowing 11 hits — although only six of 
her charged 11 runs were earned.  

April 23 (GAme 2)
UC San Diego 4, Cal State East Bay 
1 (9 innings)

The Tritons went to extra innings to 
get the win in their last regular season 
game.  

Down 1-0 in the sixth inning with 
two outs, Lesovsky homered to center-
field to tie the game.  

Gaito (25-2) went the distance, 
recording a career-high 12 strikeouts. 
The UCSD ace allowed only two hits in 
the remaining innings.

Both sides struggled in the box in 
extra innings. But the Tritons found 
a way to win, scoring their winning 
run off of a pair of errors made by 
Cal State East Bay infield. Swanberg 
homered to left field to cement the 
Triton win.

The No. 10 Tritons clinched the 
program’s first CCAA title after their 
pair of wins on Friday. With a 22-9 
CCAA record, the Tritons matched a 
school record for number of confer-
ence victories. UCSD’s .710 win per-
centage is also the best in the program’s 
history since joining Division II.  

The top-seeded Tritons will head 
into the CCAA Championships in 
Stockton this Friday, April 29, and 
will take on fourth-seeded Cal State 
Dominguez Hills.

Historic Regular Season for Tritons
▶ SOFTBALL, from page 16 4x100 team, and picked up an NCAA provisional 

qualifier with a time of 46.68. Brazil won with a time of 
44.78, and conference rivals Cal State Dominguez Hills 
finished just .02 ahead of UCSD, landing in third place. 

One week after setting a Lebanese national record, 
AB Shaheen — a Lebanese dual citizen and UCSD 
junior — improved on his mark with a throw of 186’5”. 
The mark was nearly three feet better than last week’s 
throw, and landed him in sixth in the event behind five 
Division-I athletes.

Junior Ka Wai Ng had one of the better perfor-
mances of the day, with a third-place finish in the 
triple jump. His mark of 48’0.75” is good for second-
best all-time at UCSD and a provisional qualifier, as 
Ryan Swafford of UC Riverside won the event with a 
mark of 50’7.25”.

The biggest stars of the meet were in the throwing 
events, highlighted by Canada’s Dylan Armstrong, 
who set a new national record in the shot put with a 
mark of 71’3.25”. The throw was over 12 feet farther 

than the second-place finisher from the University of 
Arizona. 

Nadine Kleinert, who won the silver medal for 
Germany in the 2004 Olympic Games, won the wom-
en’s shot put with a toss of 62’10”. The top-three finish-
ers produced the three best marks in the world so far 
this year. 

Holland’s Erik Cadee won the discus throw with 
a mark of 213’2”, which is good for fifth-best in the 
world this year. The discus ring is oriented with the 
ocean so that there is a good chance of favorable wind.

“It’s become a thing where everyone knows this is 
the place to be to throw discus on this date,” Salerno 
said. “Once you have some of the top people compet-
ing, they’re bound to throw far, on top of the condi-
tions being really helpful.”

UCSD will have next week to prepare for the 
CCAA Championships, which will be held on May 5 
through May 7 at Cal State Stanislaus.

Tritons Hold Their Own Against Elite Competition

Okasaki Moving on After Tournament
By Jessica Traynor
Staff Writer

GOLF — The UCSD golf team completed its season last 
week at the CCAA Championships, finishing sixth out 
of eight in the tournament held in Paso Robles on April 
18 to April 19. 

“Our particular conference is so strong that we have 
perennial college powers — Sonoma State, Chico State 
[and] Cal State Monterey Bay,” head coach Mike Wydra 
said.

Cal State Monterey Bay won the conference title by 
two strokes over Chico State. The Otters’ Scott Yeakel 
won the individual title by shooting 210 over the three-
round tournament. 

Senior Keith Okasaki led the Tritons, finishing in a 
tie for 11th place overall with one-over 217. Okasaki was 
four strokes back going into the final round, but had a 
rough final round score of 75 to fall back.

Lewis Simon finished 13th overall with a plus two, 
missing Super-Regional qualification by a few strokes.

On his first day, Okasaki putted extremely well. 
During the second round, strong putting continued to 
keep his score around even par. The last round went less 
smoothly, but Okasaki was able to recover overall for a 

70-72-75. 
“In this particular tournament, he putted extremely 

well, and he’s been working on his putting for the last 
couple of years even, but sometimes you just happen 
upon something that makes a big difference,” Wydra 
said. “We’re hoping that serves him well in the tourna-
ment in Albuquerque.” 

Okasaki said he was happy that he played at even 
par for all three rounds through an “impossibly tough” 
four-hole stretch. 

Making it to Super Regionals isn’t new for Okasaki. 
“I’ve been there the last couple of years, so I know 

what to expect,” Okasaki said. “I just need to put some 
more work in and prepare for it.”   

In his sophomore year, Okasaki placed 31st with a 
226 overall, and last year he shot 232. 

Okasaki’s game plan includes working on overall 
consistency and short game.  

“[I’ve] just got to chip and putt better, if I don’t hit 
the ball well,” Okasaki said. “I got to keep myself in it 
somehow.” 

Okasaki hits the green next on May 2 in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico at the NCAA Super Regional.

for wins and winning

April 22 (GAme 1)
UC San Diego 12, Cal State East Bay 2

 In the last of their regular season matchups, the 
No. 10 Tritons clinched the series opener with a 12-2 
rout over Cal State East Bay.

 With help from Pioneer pitcher Talia Ferrari — 
who threw three illegal pitches in UCSD’s first time 
at plate to get the Tritons around the bases — the 
Tritons went up 2-0 in the first, though the Pioneers 
responded with a two-run home run in their half of 

the inning.
UCSD loaded the bases after senior Sarah Woofter 

was hit by a pitch in the second inning.  With fresh-
man Taylor Sepulveda on third and senior Kris 
Lesovsky on first, freshman Mya Romero singled 
down the left-field line for two RBI. Woofter was 
brought home to score on a single by Esther Strom.

In her 23rd win, junior pitcher Camile Gaito (23-

TRACK & FIELD — San Diego’s weather 
draws more than just tourists. Past Olympians, 
Olympic hopefuls, world-record holders and 
Division-I track and field athletes from across 
the country flocked to UCSD on Saturday for 
the 2011 Triton Invitational. 

The annual event regularly draws some of 
the world’s best in the throwing events for the 
conditions favorable to getting a strong mark. 

In addition to several world-class throwers, the 
U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, 
Calif. sent several athletes, and a handful of 
female sprinters from the Brazilian and British 
national teams were also there to compete.

“It’s nice to have people want to come to 
your place,” men’s head coach Tony Salerno 
said. “They come here because they know the 
performances are going to be good, and they’re 
going to get some good marks out of it.”

Among all the star power, UCSD’s own 
athletes held their own, collecting two events 

victories and a number of competitive marks. 
Senior Jesse Morrill came out on top in the 

3000-meter steeplechase with a time of 9:20.69.
The women’s 4x400 team — consisting of 

freshman Lauren Irish and juniors Jacqueline 
Rose, Deyna Roberson and Caitlin Meagher 
— edged out UC Santa Barbara’s squad to take 
first in 3:47.12. 

The Brazilians dominated the women’s 
sprinting events, winning the 100- and 200-
meter dash as well as the 4x100 relay. Ana 
Claudia Lemos Silva won both the 100 and 200, 

with times of 11.48 and 23.44, respectively.
UCSD’s senior star sprinter Kelly Fogarty 

wasn’t far behind in both events. Fogarty ran 
11.94 in the 100 meters, finishing in fourth 
behind two Brazilian competitors and Consuella 
Moore of the U.S. Olympic Training Center. 
Fogarty finished in 23.69 in the 200-meter dash, 
taking second behind Lemos Silva. 

Fogarty was joined by Rose and sophomores 
Kathleen Hitchens and Bailey Weaver on the

Senior Kelly Fogarty took fourth and second, respectively, in the 100- and 200-meter dash while competing against several members of the Brazilian national team. Saturday’s Triton Invitational attracted many international athletes, as well as top collegians.
