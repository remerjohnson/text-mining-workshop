Calif. Republicans Will 
Try to Block Trigger Cuts

BY ZEV HURWITZ
News Editor

Republicans in California’s State 
Assembly announced last week that 
they would try to stop trigger cuts 
to California’s public universities 
if Proposition 30 fails on Tuesday. 
Proposition 30’s failure would auto-
matically cut $250 million to both 
the UC and CSU systems as well as 
additional cuts to California’s com-
munity colleges.

UC tuition is expected to jump 
$2,400 in January 2013 if failed 
Proposition 30’s trigger cuts go into 
effect, and students could expect 
annual increases —potentially around 
15 percent—for the next three years.

Assembly Minority Leader Connie 
Conway told Capital Public Radio 
Oct. 30 that while no specifics are 
yet available, Republicans in the leg-
islature would try to find alternative 
ways to fill a budget hole that Prop. 
30’s failure would create.

“I’m not saying it’s gonna be easy, 
but that’s our job,” Conway said dur-
ing a CPR broadcast. “We need to do 
some soul-searching and look around 
and figure out what we can do.”

Gov. Jerry Brown has said that 
he will veto any attempt to block the 
trigger cuts — in doing so, he hopes 
to encourage more California vot-
ers to support the ballot measure, 
which raises income taxes on house-

Courses are already available to UC students and will open to 
the public in Spring 2013.

By SARAH MOON • Contributing Writer

University of California campuses have launched a new program that will allow students to receive UC credit through online courses. The program, UC Online, is available to all UC students now and to a wider audience this spring.
The UC Office of the President hosted a teleconference regarding UC Online last 

Wednesday, Oct. 31. 
According to interim Director of UC Online Education and UC Davis faculty member 

Keith Williams, the first online course, Pre-calculus, was offered at UC Merced in Spring 2012. 
Five more courses had been made available by the end of spring: three at UCLA, one at UC 
Santa Cruz and one at UC Davis. 

Last summer UC Irvine offered another four new courses, prep for general 
chemistry, classical physics, and preparatory calculus 1A and 1B. Four new courses 
are being offered this fall quarter. UC Berkeley is offering “Beauty and Joy of 
Computing and Introduction to Information, UCSB is offering Maps and Spatial 
Reasoning” and UCR is offering “Dance: Cultures and Contexts.” 

A total of about 1,700 UC students, not including students from UCSD, have 
taken UC Online classes so far. UC online is currently developing 35 new courses.

By the Spring 2013 quarter, UC Online plans to enroll non-matriculated stu-
dents from outside the UC system. UC Online is currently working with the faculty 
and departments to provide these students with information regarding offered 
courses, and determine how many students can enroll in the program.

“We hope this will be a way to enhance access to UCs by giving these students a chance to 
enroll,” Williams said.

Williams said the program will offer a diverse selection of courses with an emphasis on 
lower division high-enrollment courses that are usually impacted and limited on campus.

“The hope is that by offering some of these courses online, it will give students an opportu-
nity to take a class that they’d otherwise have to wait a quarter or semester to get into,” Williams 
said. “That’s one of the founding principles that was based in this.”

Each online class will use several learning elements and techniques. Many professors post 

Gov. Brown has vowed that he will uphold cuts to 
education if Prop. 30 fails in Tuesday’s election.

BSU currently shares 
an office space with 
MECHA in the Student 
Services Center.

Black Student Union Will Move to 
New Office in Old Student Center

CAMPUS ClIMATE

BY DANIEL SONG
Staff Writer

UCSD has designated the space 
directly above the General Store in 
the Old Student Center as the location 
for its new Black Resource Center. 
University officials have already refur-
bished the site and will open it to 
students once they choose a director.

The new space is meant to create 
a comfortable work environment for 
black students who as of Fall 2011 
composed 1.9 percent of UCSD’s pop-
ulation. Additionally, the center will 
create a system that facilitates black 
students’ matriculation into higher 

education by providing access and 
retention programs for high school 
students and undergraduates.

The resource center will have a 
library, tutoring resources for high 
school students and workshops for law 
school, medical school and other grad-
uate programs. The newly appointed 

Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion, Linda Greene, will be 
responsible for allocating the proper 
resources and overseeing these pro-
grams.

▶ Campus — The UCSD Athletics 
Department announced that a major-
ity of its men’s basketball games will 
be broadcast live by ESPN Radio 1700 
AM. 18 preseason and regular sea-
son games will air, beginning with an 
exhibition game at San Diego State on 
Monday, Nov. 5. Craig Elsten, voice of 
Triton basketball’s online broadcasts 
for its past three seasons, will serve as 
the play-by-play announcer, with color 
commentary — expert analysis and 
background information — by other 
individuals, including former UCSD 
players. In addition, for the second 
year in a row, UCSD Men’s Basketball 
Head Coach Chris Carlson will join 
host John Kentera every Tuesday night 
for a weekly segment on XX Sports 
1090’s “Coach” Kentera Show. 

“We’re extremely happy to be part-
nering once again with ESPN Radio,” 
Carlson said.

▶ UC System — UCLA announced 
it will go tobacco-free beginning April 

22, which is also Earth Day. UCLA will 
be the first University of California 
campus to completely ban all forms of 
smoking and tobacco, including elec-
tronic cigarettes. The move follows 
UC president Mark G. Yudof ’s request 
that all 10 campuses be tobacco-free 
by 2014. UCLA professor Linda Sarna 
hopes the policy will help students to 
quit smoking. 

“We know the combination of both 
using some medicine and social sup-
port is the gold standard,” Sarna told 
NBC Los Angeles.

▶ San Diego — Three men wearing 
skeleton masks attacked and pepper-
sprayed a group of five trick-or-treat-
ers on Halloween night in Mira Mesa. 
One suffered a knife wound to the 
arm. The victims, all teenagers, were 
trick-or-treating on Zapata Avenue 
shortly after 8 p.m. when the men 
started to pursue them. One of the 
group members told the men to stop, 
and a chase and fight ensued. Police 
say the incident may be gang-related.

▶ San Diego — Dozens of El Cajon 
residents called the police after seeing 
strange lights floating in the sky above 
their neighborhood. People congre-
gated in parking lots, staring at the 
non-moving lights thousands of feet 
in the air. Police later discovered that 
the lights belonged to a neighbor who 
had spent $300 on balloons, helium, 
and lights and had attached them to a 
fishing line that he launched 4,000 feet 
into the air.

▶ UC System —UC Berkeley frater-
nity Theta Delta Chi has been strongly 
criticized after hanging a gray-headed 
fake body from a noose outside its 
chapter’s house on Durant Avenue. 
The body was part of the fraternity’s 
haunted house decorations and was 
quickly taken down after a picture of 
the decorations sparked accusations 
of racism on Facebook. Many critics 
on campus likened the decoration to 
racially charged public hangings. The 
haunted house is one of the fraternity’s 
biggest charity events, with proceeds 

going to Autism Speaks and Green 
Stampede. Theta Delta Chi’s philan-
thropy chair Devin Shoop apologized 
for the mix up soon afterward.

students regardless of political affilia-
tion or culturally black identity,” BSU 
Co-Chair Grant White said.

According to White and BSU co-
chair Bijon Robinson, the plan for the 
center began in the summer of 2009. 

In 2009, the BSU board wrote a 
report entitled “Do U C Us?” which 
compiled testimonies and statistics 
about the state of diversity at UCSD 
and emphasized the lack of resources 
available to black students.

When racially charged events 
stirred the campus in the winter of 
2010, the BSU included the resource 
center in a list of demands that it 
believed were necessary to address the 
poor climate on campus.

White and Robinson sat on the 
hiring committee and worked exten-
sively with university officials to hire a 
director for the center.  BSU’s endeav-
or gained momentum once former 
UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
approved the project.

The former chancellor brought 

in a team of experienced administra-
tors like Kathleen Johnson and Gary 
Radcliff to form a hiring committee.

“Once we convinced administra-
tion like the chancellor that this was 
important, it all just fell into place,” 
Robinson said.

The center will likely open some-
time during winter quarter, after the 
Vice Chair of Equity, Diversity and 
Inclusion assumes her role on Jan. 2.

holds earning over $250,000 for seven 
years and increases sales tax by one-
quarter-of-one-percent for four years. 
Proposition 30 is particularly impor-
tant to Brown, as the enacted 2012 
state budget assumes the measure will 
pass and uses the new funding to close 
budget holes.

“I will veto any bill that attempts to 
undo the trigger cuts,” Brown said in 
a recent interview with Capital Public 
Radio. “We have to balance our bud-
get.”

In September, the governor 
signed AB 970, a law that requires the 
California college systems to give stu-
dents and their families more advance 
warning before enacting a fee hike. 
University systems will now have to 
tell affected parties at least 30 days 
prior to passing a tuition hike.

Despite the new law, UCSD Vice 
President of External Affairs Olamide 
Noah sent an email to councilmem-
bers on Nov. 1 clarifying that although, 
under the new law, UC Regents would 
need to announce potential increases 
at least 10 days before a meeting, the 

law does not take effect until January.
“Today, [UC Student Regent 

Jonathan Stein] told me that AB 970 
goes into effect Jan. 1, and thus, unfor-
tunately, won’t apply to a November 
tuition increase,” she  wrote.

Even if Prop. 30 passes, UC stu-
dents will not be clear from more 
fee increases. A potential tuition hike 
of around five percent is likely for 
2013-2014 even if Proposition 30 is 
successful.

introductory videos along with the 
class syllabus and a calendar with 
assignment due dates. Professors post 
lectures in various mediums, includ-
ing videos, podcasts and PowerPoints.  
Most classes have activities, such as 
blog posts and interactive data tables, 
which count toward participation 
and assignment grades, and some 
also have the option to participate in 
online study groups with other stu-
dents enrolled in the course.

UC Online classes will be covered 
by class tuition costs for UC students. 
Students matriculated to one UC 
campus have the option of enrolling 
in courses at another UC campuses 
but may face difficulties regarding 
financial aid and major credit due to 
the differing campus systems.

UCSD will offer its first UC 
Online course, Acoustics and Digital 
Music Creation, in Winter or Spring 
2013.

According to Associate Vice 
President of Academic Affairs 

Sammy Chang, UCSD faculty and 
department members have expressed 
concerns regarding the effects of 
offering systemwide courses and 
allowing students outside of the UC 
system access to UC curricula.

“UCSD’s online education plan 
should focus first on serving UCSD’s 
own students,” Chang said. “I believe 
online courses work if it’s within the 
campus, not the entire UC system.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

In a move to increase the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) majors, a task force created by Florida Gov. Rick Scott recommended that tuition be kept lower 
for certain majors. Despite the benevolent intentions of the governor’s 
team, this proposal is a poor way to incite interest in 
the sciences. The task force specifically recommends 
that tuition be lower for “strategic areas of emphasis.” 
This term is defined by the legislature and considers 
STEM and health-related majors as focus areas. Over the 
next three years, students enrolled in these majors will 
not face tuition increases. If there is lost revenue from 
stable tuition rates, the tuition for students in majors 
like political science, anthropology and psychology will 
increase.

The trend of differential tuitions at universities began 
in the ‘80s, and the number of institutions doing so has 
swiftly increased over the past two decades. According to a study from 
the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute, 143 universities 
charge some form of differential tuition. Of these 143, 29 percent are 
bachelor’s institutions and 41 percent are doctoral institutions. The 
University of Maine, for example, charges an additional $75 for each 
engineering course. Another study by the Advisory Board Company 
found that roughly one-third of public research universities use some 

form of differential pricing to make their business and engineering 
programs more expensive. This analysis considered the additional 
program and equipment fees as a de facto higher tuition. On average, 
business programs have tuition 20-25 percent higher than the base 

rate, and engineering 25-30 percent higher. Despite this 
pricing, the number of STEM graduates has remained 
steady over the past 30 years.

Florida, then, would be bucking the trend by making 
engineering programs cheaper than other majors. This 
is why this proposal is quite puzzling. Part of the reason 
universities charge higher tuitions for these majors is 
because they are in higher demand. Students flock to 
these majors knowing they will receive a job with a 
high salary once they graduate. The median starting 
salary in the U.S. for engineers is $58,581, compared to 
$42,569 for all graduates. And the unemployment rate 

for engineers is under 2 percent, compared to 7.9 percent for other 
occupations. If job prospects for these majors were poor, it might 
make sense to lower tuition rates. For the most part, though, these 
students will graduate with well-paying jobs and be able to pay off 
student loans.

Come at a Price

Winding my clock back one hour this past Sunday felt like taking a Sharpie and 
willfully changing the expiration date 
on a carton of milk. I have realized 
that by simply changing a label, I can 
be deceived into believing anything 
that better aligns with my interests, 
whether that be gaining an extra hour 

of daylight or an extra day of eating 
my Cheerios with milk. Twice a year, 
Daylight Saving Time makes me 
question my intelligence. One, because 
I still mistakenly call it Daylight 
Savings, with an extra “s” in “savings” 
— no matter how many times AP style 
corrects me — and two, it gives me 
the feeling that I am feeding myself a 
convenient fiction.

The sun now appears to rise and 
set earlier than it did 24 hours ago. 
This time change is agreeable with my 
schedule, as I no longer have to bump 
into my fridge every morning and 
solemnly eat breakfast in the dark. But 
of course this is no coincidence — the 
measurement of time is largely a man-
made construct and has been tailored 
to accommodate to man himself.

During World War I, people 
realized that they could simply change 
the time in spring to get an extra 
hour of sunlight and save energy for 
wartime production. Between wars 
and after World War II, Daylight 
Saving was practiced on a state-by-
state basis until it became nationally 
standardized in 1966. In 2007, the time 
period between moving the clocks 
forward in spring and backward in fall 
was lengthened by four weeks, due to 
environmentalist cries that 100,000 
barrels of oil could be saved per each 
extended day.

It disconcerts me to know that 
while the national government can 
regulate mundane issues, such as 
the sale of defective items at garage 
sales, it can also change how an entire 
nation (aside from the rebel states 
Hawaii and Arizona) perceives time. 
Moving a clock’s hour hand back 
does not literally alter the course of 
time. If Congress suddenly declared 
this month to be December and not 
November, I would not be surprised if 
people unhesitatingly concurred while 
exalting in Christmas’ quicker arrival.

When it comes down to it, 
Daylight Saving is basically a lie that 
we tell ourselves to better suit our 
needs. An extra hour of daylight in the 
springtime is pleasant, and helps us cut 
down our electricity bills. No one likes 
to commute in the darkness every fall 
morning, and it’s a hassle to stumble 
over bushes in the dark while walking 
home in the spring evenings. Since 
the practice is advantageous and has 
been as regular an occurrence as the 
changing of the leaves every autumn, 
people don’t think twice about it 
actually being a falsehood.

Whether we questioned the 
validity of turning our clocks back, 
we all benefited from the extra hour 
last weekend. Most certainly, Barack 
Obama and Mitt Romney must be 
cheering for the extra 60 minutes they 
get to vie for votes before Election Day 
tomorrow.

Daylight 
Saving is a 
Convenient 
Falsehood

Die-hard “Star Wars” fans were aghast when 
Blu-Ray versions of the six films arrived in 2011 
with random modifications, such as a shiny R2-D2 
and edited dialogue. Recent history indicates that 
the upcoming seventh “Star Wars” episode is sure to 
be another ill-conceived departure from the original 
trilogy, diluting the appeal of the franchise. 

After a computer graphics-heavy prequel trilogy, 
the critically maligned animated television series 
“The Clone Wars,” and various Blu-Ray re-releases, 
it is disconcerting that anybody will be taking the 
reins for yet another spinoff, much less Disney. 
As online commenters rightly note, the iconic 
Han Solo will be a crotchety septuagenarian, and 
Princess Leia will be added to the stable of generic 
Disney princesses. In comparison to the three origi-
nal films, everyone from film critic Roger Ebert to 
Tumblr bloggers panned the three prequel episodes 
for the poor acting and the irritating presence of the 
creature Jar-Jar Binks. Following a string of unfavor-
able receptions, the producers should learn from 
their mistakes and realize that a seventh addition 
would only be a step in the wrong direction.

Alienating the franchise’s most ardent support-
ers is certainly not the way to build upon the “Star 
Wars” legend. The historic success of the films has, 
in part, depended on avid fans at Comic-Con tot-
ing Darth Vader masks and wielding lightsabers 
— this latest attempt at a cash grab will only please 
five-year old kids whose allegiances are likely too 
ephemeral to spawn lifelong Star Wars addictions.

franchise, Disney. While Lucas’ decision to 
create a prequel to the original series in 1999 
has been criticized, these new films will answer 
fans’ calls for more “Star Wars” and expose a new 
generation to a groundbreaking series that began 
in 1977. 

Many fans on Tumblr have labeled Lucas 
a sell-out, believing that creating even more 
movies will ruin the series. But by continuing 
“Star Wars,” Disney and Lucas will be satisfying 
many die-hard fans’ need for more. Disney Chief 
Executive Robert A. Iger stated that the release 
of the latest film in 2005 had created “pent-up 
demand.” 

The “Star Wars” hype appears to be 
ever- present. Two summers ago, Disneyland  
revamped Star Tours, a virtual attraction that 
garnered a two-hour long wait at its opening. The 
Cartoon Network series “Star Wars: the Clone 
Wars” aired in 2008, and with three million 
total viewers, set the record as the network’s 
most-watched series premiere. It is currently 
completing its 5th season. Additionally, there 
are 64,684 “Jawas” who follow the Star Wars 
subreddit. 

Star Wars is not a dying fad. By continuing the 
series, many new fans will be able to “discover the 
force” and share in Yoda’s wisdom.

New Trilogy Is Answering Fan Demand
Last Tuesday, Disney announced that Lucasfilm 

Ltd. is joining the Disney family, and that a new 
Star Wars trilogy is in the works. The $4.05 billion 
deal gives Disney creative control of both the “Star 
Wars” and “Indiana Jones” franchises, as well as 
the production companies Industrial Light & 
Magic and Industrial Sound. While the new films 
show promise, this deal is just another example of 
corporate conglomeration.

A decade ago, Disney was a groundbreaking 
animation studio, but now it is becoming obsessed 
with commercialization. With this deal, Lucasfilm 
joins a long list of acquired Disney properties: Pixar, 
Marvel, ABC and ESPN, to name a few. The new 
“Star Wars” venture seems like an attempt to reel in 
any last profits from an old franchise.

Disney traditionally releases a few films a year 
that are of great quality, but in recent years, it seems 
like Disney has been sacrificing quality for quantity. 
In 2011 alone, Disney and its subsidiary Touchstone 
Pictures released an astounding 14 films, with only 
three of these being commercial hits. In 1995, Walt 
Disney Pictures released far fewer films, two of 
which grossed over $40 million dollars and two 
more that had high “fresh” ratings on the film critic 
website Rottentomatoes.com. 

While fans are hopeful the new “Star Wars” 
films will show merit, the purchase of Lucasfilm is 
further evidence that Disney has transformed from 
a family-friendly animation studio into a faceless 
$40-billion-a-year empire.

Solve FoR X By Philip Jia

The state is wrong to subsidize 
tuitions based on job market needs. 
As economist Alex Tabarrok explains, 
wages already reflect their needs. 
Engineer salaries are high because 
firms highly demand them. Tuition 
rates are not the reason students do 
not become STEM majors, but rather 
it is a lack of desire to study STEM 
fields. A study by the Business-Higher 
Education Forum in 2011 showed 
that only 17 percent of high school 
seniors were both proficient in math 
and interested in STEM fields. This 
corresponds closely with the 16 
percent of all college graduates who 
major in these programs.

Making tuition lower will not 

motivate students who don’t like math 
to suddenly become physicists or 
engineers. Nor should we encourage 
students who would perform better 
in other majors to enter the STEM 
fields unmotivated and unprepared. 
To resolve the problem of a lack of 
STEM graduates, the public education 
system needs to be overhauled to 
adequately teach students in science 
and math. For example, students with 
an interest in these fields should be 
integrated into the workforce as soon 
as possible with an apprenticeship-
type program. 

At UCSD, for example, the Society 
of Women Engineers hosts an event 
where high school girls can tour 
engineering labs and become familiar 
with the engineering career. This 

teaches students to enjoy math and 
science early and removes any stigma 
these subjects may have.

While the goal of increasing STEM 
graduates is noble, altering tuition 
rates are an ineffective means to do so. 
No dance major will suddenly become 
interested in computer science 
because the degree is cheaper. Trying 
to coordinate tuition rates with the 
market simply will not compensate 
for the failure of the public education 
system. We should be vigilant against 
any palliatives like this and instead 
work towards comprehensive school 
reform in order to actually increase 
the number of STEM students.

Stigma of  STEM Majors Must be Removed

Dear editor,
As I write this letter (Oct. 24) 

the academic year is in full swing 
here in the U.S., but half a world 
away, in southern Israel, classes 
have been cancelled for the second 
day and  millions of  Israeli resi-
dents have been instructed to stay 
near public shelters or the forti-
fied rooms in their houses. Life in 
southern Israel has been shut down 
by a hail of rockets coming from 
nearby Gaza. Hamas, the funda-
mentalist Islamic terrorist organi-
zation that rules Gaza and openly 
dedicates itself to eradicating Israel, 
has admitted launching the rockets. 
Thus far, the barrage has injured 
six civilians, two of them critically. 
This is a not a new situation for 
Israelis; 800 rockets have been fired 
into Israel from Gaza so far this 
year. An exasperated Israeli woman 
whose neighborhood has been 
struck by five rockets lamented to 
a New York Times reporter, “It is 
absurd that we live like this.”   

Yet most UCSD students are not 
cognizant of these frequent rocket 
attacks on Israel because awareness 
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
on campus is primarily driven by   
MSA and SJP, whose agenda is, I 
feel, to convince their fellow stu-
dents that the conflict is a straight-
forward case of egregious behavior 
by Israel perpetuated upon blame-
less and powerless Palestinians. 
They have no desire, therefore, to 
raise awareness of events, like the 
current unfolding spasm, which 
involve Palestinians inflicting 
deadly violence upon innocent 
Israeli citizens and which reveals 
a much more complex conflict 
dynamic then the narrative they are 

promoting. Instead their preferred 
modus operandi is to wait until 
Israel is pushed to respond in some 
highly dramatic fashion, like build-
ing security barriers or launching 
military operations to root out ter-
rorists. When that happens they go 
wild with righteous indignation, 
bemoaning the inevitable impact 
on Palestinian civilians while 
assiduously sterilizing the narrative 
they serve up to the campus com-
munity so it contains no hint of the 
Palestinian provocations. 

So far the current episode of 
violence has offered no grist for 
the Israel-obsession mill because 
Israel’s military response, as widely 
reported by the press, has been 
tempered and precise, using air 
strikes to eliminate several rocket-
launching squads without inflicting 
civilian casualties inside Gaza. As 
long as this remains the case, the 
Israel demonizing contingent on 
campus will ignore the situation. 
However, Israeli leaders are warn-
ing that if the rocket fire doesn’t 
relent, they may be forced to launch 
a larger military response as they 
were in 2008 when Israel invaded 
Gaza. If that happens, there is 
bound to be Palestinian civilian 
casualties and then we will witness 
the Israel demonizing machine 
vociferously come to life on our 
campus. Either way, we can be sure 
this year the same anti-Israel crowd 
will, once again, launch the usual 
obscenely disingenuous campaign 
to cajole A.S. into adopting a reso-
lution calling for UCSD to divest 
in companies like General Electric 
because they supply Israel’s Air 
Force with the very technology that 
allows it to surgically target ter-
rorists while avoiding Palestinian 
civilians.

UCSD Should Not

Admitting 
the Facts 
About Low 
Admit Rates
Over the past decade, under-graduate admission rates have fallen across the coun-
try. And while a report released by 
the Registrar’s Office on Oct. 23 may 
suggest that UCSD is bucking the 
trend with a slightly higher accep-
tance rate for 2012-13 (37.7 percent), 
the rankings-obsessed should relax 
and remember that we are still far 
more selective than we were in 2000, 

when we had an admission rate of 
55.7 percent.

More importantly, perhaps, they 
should remember that a lower admis-
sion rate does not translate directly to 
a better education. There are many 
other factors at play.

For one thing, the world is a more 
competitive place than it used to be. 
Whether it’s getting a minimum-
wage job at McDonald’s for a sum-
mer, or an unpaid internship at a 
research firm for a quarter, the lists of 
candidates for positions seem to get 
bigger with every year.  

According to a long-overdue 
report published Sept. 22 by job 
search engine “Simply Hired”, it is no 
illusion. In 1991, there was an average 
of four applicants per available job—
though this figure varied widely by 
the industry and level of the position. 
By January 2012, that number had 
risen to 23. In the language of admis-
sion rates, that’s a drop from 25 per-
cent to 4.3 percent. To put that into 
perspective, it is now harder to get a 
salaried job than it is to be accepted 
to Harvard, which had a 5.9 percent 
overall acceptance rate this year.

It’s counterintuitive. But it makes 
more sense when you take the mech-
anisms into account, which is what 
James Rosenbaum did in his 1996 
paper, “Gatekeeping in an Era of 
More Open Gates.” In a nutshell, he 
proposed that panic about jobs leads 
people to apply to more places, which 
leads to lower admission rates, which 
leads to more panic, and so on. The 
cycle only stops when job seekers (or 
college applicants) grow discouraged 
or complacent, and cease to apply. 
Back when UCSD had a 55.7 percent 
acceptance rate, its admitted students 
applied to a median of six other col-
leges, according to statistics released 
by the UC Office of the registrar. For 
the 2012-13 batch of freshmen, that 
median has shot up to 13.

It’s a cycle that has very little to 
do with the quality of education 
offered by a university. Take Oxford 
and Cambridge, the top universities 
in the U.K. Their admissions rates 
have actually increased over the past 
decade: They admitted 18.4 percent 
of their applicants in 2002, but nearly 
26 percent last year. 

The finding is consistent with 
a trend called “discouragement” 
observed by the economist Raquel 
Fernandez in a 1996 paper, “On 
the Political Economy of Education 
Subsidies:” As students get discour-
aged by the prospect of social mobil-
ity in poor economic times, the trend

With this year’s launch of UC Online, a program that allows UC students to take courses for aca-demic credit online, the University of California 
is jumping on a bandwagon with some very prominent 
riders.

Pundits, columnists and techies alike have raved that 
online course offerings have the potential to transform 
higher education for students, faculty and casual learn-
ers.  Because we are following in the footsteps of popular 
online education websites — MIT’s Open Courseware 
Suite, Stanford’s Coursera, UC Berkeley’s webcast.berkeley, 
Academic Earth, and Khan Academy, just to name a few — 
UCSD is in a unique position to reap the benefits.

While the online education programs mentioned above 
are catered toward their respective universities, UC Online 
aims to implement a program of courses across all UC cam-
puses. Several UC campuses currently offer courses through 
the site, all of which are covered by students’ class tuition 
costs. The program’s focus is on impacted, lower-division 
courses: the idea is to make it easier for students to enroll in 
their required general education and major classes, which 
are normally more difficult to get into. 

UCSD will be making its debut on UC Online this win-
ter or spring, depending on the instructors’ availability. Its 
first offering will be a course titled Acoustics and Digital 
Music Creation.

Eventually, UC Online hopes to extend its program to 
non-UC students. But as of now, UC Online is open to 
all UC students, who are also allowed to enroll in courses 
offered by other UCs. However, transferring credits and 
recieving financial aid for classes offered by other UC cam-
puses will not be a simple process, according to a page on 
the website for UC Online. 

It’s a concern that’s been voiced before. In an interview 
with The Week in August 2012, Jason Wingard, a vice 

dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business 
School, expressed the concern that online courses can lower 
the perceived value of an institution. 

“You run the risk of potentially diluting your brand,” he 
wrote.

However, some of the most successful online course 
offerings, such as Open Yale Courses and Carnegie Mellon’s 
Open Learning Initiative, have been launched without any 
significant brand depreciation. Carnegie Mellon received a 
record high of 26,431 applications last year, and Yale has not 
faced any significant changes in its admissions numbers. 

“Our purpose is to create and disseminate knowledge 
to a broad range of people,” Director of Open Yale Courses 
Diana Kleiner said.  “It is great that we can harness the 
power of the internet.” 

Carnegie Mellon University’s Open Learning Initiative 
offers online courses and collects real-time data about 
student activity, which allows students to spend more time 
with difficult concepts via a collection of freely available 
videos.   

“OLI courses run in combination with the classroom 
setting to create the best possible education for our stu-
dents,” OLI director Candace Thille said.

By contrast, UC Online is designed for students who 
can’t get into popular classes. Although courses offered 
through UC Online do have instructors, students are not 
expected to go into a physical classroom to learn.

In 2007, researchers at Carnegie Mellon conducted a 
study that showed that students taking an OLI introductory 
statistics course with minimal instructor contact performed 
as well as, or better than, students in traditional classes. This 
comes as good news for students who find themselves in the 
position of having to take an in-demand course through

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  moNDAy, NovEmbER 5,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG 7

A Different Type of Evangelist
BY AYAn KusAri
Features Editor

Most mornings, there are only 
five or six of them, scattered across 
Library Walk and Warren Mall, 
standing next to cardboard boxes 
of pocket Bibles and rubbing their 
palms together to keep warm. They 
come early, before the sun rises, and 
wait patiently for UCSD students to 
wake.  

The Gideons of San Diego first 
came to the UCSD campus Oct. 15, 
and are here to stay for the rest of 
the quarter. On many mornings, they 
share their space with the more vocal 
evangelists on Library Walk, who 
hold large neon posters and preach 
about fire and brimstone. Unlike 
these other Christian activists, the 
Gideons declined to be photographed 
for The Guardian. 

“We don’t like drawing attention. 
And we don’t tell people they’re going 
to hell,” said Aaron, a Gideon who is 
63 years old and retired. He refused 
to provide his last name. “We’re just 
worried they might not make it to 
heaven.”

This is the group’s first year at 
UCSD, but they have campaigned at 
San Diego State in previous years. 
Wherever they go, their task is sim-
ple: hand out Bibles and ask people 
if they think they’re going to Heaven.

“I wasn’t always saved,” Aaron 
said. “I wasn’t very religious at all, 
when I was young.”

Aaron said his wife had been 
more religious than he had been, at 
first: “But things changed when I lost 
my job. Those were hard times.”

Another Gideon named Dan 
identified himself as a UCSD gradu-
ate: class of ‘76 with a degree in 

mechanical engineering.
“I became a Christian right here. 

Well not exactly here — it was in 
Plaza Cafe.”

Dan said he was inspired to take 
religion more seriously after an inter-
action with the college Christian 
group, Campus Crusades. They were 
holding a recruitment event in the 
dining hall around lunchtime.

“I was eating a cheeseburger when 

one of them, a girl wearing a CC shirt 
came up to me and asked me, quite 
simply, if I knew whether I was going 
to Heaven or not.”

Dan said that when he confided 
that he wasn’t sure, the girl invited 
him to join CC, beginning what he 
calls half a lifetime of religious ser-
vice.

Another Gideon named Samuel 
said he joined the Gideons when he 
was 33, when he moved to the San 

Diego area and faced work problems.
“We preach the same thing any 

other denomination,” Samuel said. 
“We just take preaching more seri-
ously than most others.”

When they are campaigning 
simultaneously, the Gideons keep 
their distance from the other, more 
vocal Christian activists on cam-
pus. One such activist, a man who 
identified himself only as “Neil the 
Christian”, and who is pictured in 
the photograph for this article, said 
that the Gideons are unlike any other 
evangelical group he has encoun-
tered. 

“It’s a very passive approach,” he 
said. “All the Gideons do is pass out 
the book — which is good — but it’s 
all they do. It allows them to avoid 
some of the confrontation that we 
have to put up with on a regular basis. 
When Jesus said to go out to the 
highways and the hedges, he didn’t 
mean for it to be that easy.” 

However, various members of the 
Gideons group said they face sig-
nificant opposition from students, in 
spite of the relative passivity of their 
approach. 

“It’s unusual,” Aaron said about 
being asked for an interview. He 
expected harsh criticism, not ques-
tions. “Students don’t like us, nor-
mally. They shout things at us. Tell 
us to leave”

He said, however, that things had 
not always been difficult for Christian 
groups visiting the UCSD campus.

“When I was here, everyone was 
excited to learn about the Good 
News. But I guess things are differ-
ent now.”

Soon after the first reports came about the occupation of

Cairo, where he stayed amidst the evergrowing masses 
for weeks. His film introduces us to young Egyptians who 
spend all day and night talking, shouting, singing, and 
finally expressing everything they were forbidden to say 
until now. As the protests grow in intensity, the regime’s 
repression becomes more violent, with the terrifying 
potential for massacre never far away. Tahrir is a film 
written in the faces and voices of those who experienced 
this period in the square. It is a day-to-day account of the 
revolution, capturing the anger, fear, resolve, and finally 
elation of those who made it happen.

Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder Records, he made his 
production debut in the late 2000s with a series of 
EPs. Born William Benjamin Bensussen, he originally 
comes from San Diego, CA, whose downtown Gaslamp 
District’s bar scene inspired him to name himself the 
Gaslamp Killer in disgust for much of the patronage. 
Upon relocating to Los Angeles, he found a niche for 
himself amid the city’s massive underground party 
sceneand ultimately found a home for himself as a 
resident DJ at the club Low End Theory, which resulted 
in a series of club-sponsored podcasts. He has 
released his latest album 'Breakthrough' in 2012, for 
which he is currently touring.

of lower admissions rates in dif-
ficult economic times begins to 
reverse. Considering that the UC 
system admitted a lower fraction of 
students overall, it’s highly unlikely 
that discouragement is to blame for 
UCSD’s slightly increased admis-
sion rate this year. But it’s still 
something to keep an eye out for in 
the upcoming years.  

There’s another factor that can 
have a strong impact on admis-
sions rates: population. And while 
it’s often overlooked, it can some-
times play the most significant role 
of all. In India, which has fewer 
than 400 universities for its 1.2 bil-
lion citizens, admissions rates for 
the Indian Institute of Technology 
have hovered around 2 percent in 
good economic times and bad, for 
over 30 years. The most significant 
contributor to the depressed over-

all admissions rate in India is the 
country’s population.

California’s population of 13 to 
18 year olds has been growing at 
a rate of about 4 percent per year 
for the past 10 years, meaning that 
things will get more competitive 
in terms of sheer number of appli-
cants. However, evidence from the 
National Bureau of Labor suggests 
that the economy won’t improve 
significantly anytime soon, no mat-
ter who is elected. This may mean 
more high school students will 
grow discouraged, making it easier 
for those who continue to struggle 
to be admitted. 

But that’s speculation. The 
admissions game — for universities 
and jobs alike — is a lot more com-
plex than it seems. What this means 
for us is that as much as we’d like it 
to, a 37.7 percent admissions rate 
doesn’t say much on its own. 

Selectivity Doesn’t Mean Quality
▶ admission, from page 6

UC Online. 
Advocates of OLI and other exper-

imental online university education 
programs point to their ability to 
increase the accessibility to education. 

“Higher education can raise grad-
uation rates and lower costs to sup-
port a greater number of students 
earning a higher quality education,” 
Thille said.  “We are being asked to 
educate not just more students, but a 
much greater diversity [of them].  We 
need to use all our available tools to 
extend this reach.”

Still, Thille does not believe a 
website can fully replace instructor-
student learning.

“Though the classroom setting 
is expensive, I don’t think it can 

be replaced,” she said.  “In terms 
of undergraduate education, noth-
ing beats the experience of going 
to school and learning life skills on 
top of academics. For now, Open 
Learning Initiative works in combi-
nation with the classroom setting in 
order to create the best education for 
our students.”

But others, such as Kleiner, dis-
agree. She sees the advent of online 
course offerings as just the beginning 
of a larger trend. 

“What we are seeing is an online 
movement towards shared education 
for all and more opportunities for 
higher education.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
Men’s Basketball team has been 
picked to finish second to last in 
the annual CCAA preseason coaches’ 
poll, released last Wednesday, Oct. 
31.

In 2011, the Tritons were picked 
to finish 10th in the 12-team confer-
ence. UCSD proved to over perform 
at the beginning of the season, going 
5-1 to start, eventually closing the 
campaign out with a 6-16 CCAA 
record, good for 11th place.

Chico State, the defending CCAA 
regular season champion, tops the 
preseason poll for the second season 
in a row, while Cal Poly Pomona 
was ranked second, and CSU San 
Bernardino came in at third.

“This season, we should definitely 
show some improvement,” starting 
forward Justin Brue said. “[Coach 

Carlson’s] made some changes, that 
will let us play to our strengths and 
hopefully help us out a bit.”

The Tritons have one notable gap 
in the roster, left by the departures of 
6’8” starting center Christian Hatch 
and his relief 6’10” Ryan Wheeler. 
Hatch served as UCSD’s leading scor-
er, averaging 12.5 points per game, 
while also leading in rebounds with 
7.3 per game.

This season, UCSD Head Coach 
Chris Carlson adds five new fresh-
men to his 14-player roster, although 
only one of his newcomers is report-
ed to be a center.

“I think that [Carlson] recruited 
some really good players,” Brue said. 
“I think a few of them are definitely 
going to be getting some playing 
time, and I really like the chemistry 
that the team has now.”

UCSD opens up the 2012-2013 
season with an exhibition match, 
scheduled for today, Monday, Nov. 5, 
at 7:05 p.m. against No. 20 San Diego 
State, at Aztec Stadium.

Tritons Win Eighth CCAA Title, 
Clain Automatic NCAA Bid

From there the Tritons hun-
kered down to protect their nar-
row 1-0 lead. True freshman goal-
keeper Kelcie Brodsky registered an 
impressive nine saves, protecting 
the net from a Sonoma attack that 
recorded 27 shots to UCSD’s 11.

The Triton backline, made up of 
all-CCAA selections Ellen Wilson 
and Hayley Johnson, did well to 
shut down one of the most danger-
ous offenses in the conference for 
44 minutes. In the last 45 seconds of 
the match, Seawolf forward Margi 
Osmundson found her way into the 
UCSD goal box, lifting a shot over 
Brodsky to send the game into over-
time.

Spent from 90 minutes of play, 
neither team seemed to seriously 
consider a golden goal victory, with 
both UCSD and Sonoma State reg-
istering just two shots in the second 
overtime period.

Both teams began the shootout 
with two solid finishes. Hernandez 

finished her penalty to give UCSD 
a brief 2-1 lead, which held through 
the next three opportunities, all 
missed. Wilson and Johnson both 
finished their chances to lift the 
Tritons to the win. 

“This is what UCSD soccer 
is all about and I’m so happy to 
finally win the CCAA Tournament,” 
Johnson said. “We’ve been working 
hard and starting to play really well 
and are all honored to join the best 
teams that have come through the 
program as league champions.”

With the conference title, the 
Tritons earn the automatic bid to 
the NCAA Division II National 
Championship. The NCAA Selection 
Show, where the NCAA seedings 
will be announced, is scheduled for 
today at 4:30 p.m., available to be 
streamed live at NCAA.com. UCSD 
will be making its 12th appearance 
in their 13 years since moving to 
Division II.

The Student-Athelete Struggle

depleted energy, and the near-incon-
ceivable stress, the question remains: 
If we aren’t going to make money off 
it someday, why do we do it?

Obviously, the answer is different 
for every athlete. For some, it’s that 
sense of belonging to a community 
that “gets” them — a community that 
knows what excruciating yet self-
inflicted physical exhaustion feels 
like, or that near-familial bond that 
forms between teammates. For oth-

ers, it’s to stay in peak shape. While 
still others are addicted to it — the 
floods of endorphins, the surges of 
adrenaline, the unbelievable rush that 
follows a big win or even the soul-
crushing despair that comes with a 
big loss. And, as one of my friends 
ever-so-eloquently put it, some do it 
for “the chicks.”

But what it all comes down to 
is actually pretty simple: we do it 
because we can’t imagine what our 
lives would be like without it.

▶ ANDErSON, from page 12

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL —Despite 
going 30-3 in the regular season and 
21-1 in conference last season, the 
UCSD Women’s Basketball team goes 
into 2012 picked to finish third in 
the CCAA. In the annual preseason 
coaches’ poll, the Tritons were ranked 
behind first place CSU Monterey Bay 
as well as Cal State Los Angeles. 

Granted, not much is left of the 
core of the 2011-2012 team that set 
the program record for number of 
wins in a single season. This season’s 
squad will go without forward Lauren 
Freidenberg — a three-time All-CCAA 
selection — as well as UCSD’s all-time 
assist leader, guard Chelsea Carlisle. 
Although Carlisle will remain with the 
program as an assistant coach, the 
Tritons will certainly miss her impact 
on the court, as she has been UCSD’s 
leading scorer for the past three sea-
sons. 

Rounding out the departures is 
former head coach Charity Elliott, 
who left her post at UCSD for a 

position at Loyola 
Marymount. 
Fortunately, the 
UCSD Athletics 
Department has 
found a more 
than qualified 
replacement in 
Heidi Vanderveer, 
whose background 
includes experi-
ence at the WNBA 
and national 
levels.

The Tritons 
retain guards, 
fifth-year 
Daisy Feder 
and senior 
Emily Osga, 
both 
2011-

2012 All CCAA-First team selections. 
The Tritons also return junior forward 
Erin Dautremont, a CCAA Second 
team selection.

UCSD’s first game is scheduled for 
Friday, Nov. 9 at the Disney Tip-Off 
Classic, held in Anaheim, California, 
where the Tritons will look to protect 
their title.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Finally First

Historically, The UCSD Women’s Soccer team has performed poorly in penalty shootouts. In the past two seasons, the Tritons have been elimi-
nated in the semifinal round by penalty kicks.

This season, UCSD broke the curse of the semifinal 
stumbling block, sinking CSU Stanislaus 1-0 in the first 
round before beating No. 7 nationally ranked Sonoma 
State 4-2 in penalty kicks.

It may have been the maturity of a team that’s been 
to the CCAA tournament four times in the past four 
seasons and the NCAA Division II Tournament twice, 
or the fact that the Tritons needed a conference title to 
assure a national tournament berth, but either way, No. 
13 UCSD took the CCAA title over No. 7 Sonoma State 
in penalties.

“It was a great feeling to finally win the CCAA tourna-
ment after coming up short for three years,” Wilson said. 
“Both games were battles, but I think we kept our com-
posure and put in a lot of work and definitely deserved 
to come out on top.”

The Tritons advanced to the title match after taking 
down CSU Stanislaus, a team that defeated UCSD 1-0 
just two weeks prior.

Yesterday, Nov. 4, senior forward Gabi Hernandez 
broke the 0-0 gridlock in the 24th second of the second 
half. Hernandez — named the CCAA Tournament MVP 
— sent a high, arching shot into the top corner to put 
UCSD up 1-0.

Hurdles to
Clear: The 
Student 
Athlete
I’ve gotten this question more than once.It’s always carefully worded, 
with the asker’s head tilted in curios-
ity: “So, if you don’t plan on going 
pro, then why spend so much time 
and energy doing a sport?”

I don’t harbor any fantasy of 
becoming a professional runner. It 

takes an immense amount of dedi-
cation, training, natural talent and 
luck — and honestly, I’m just not 
speedy enough to cut it in the pro 
circuit. But I do college track. The 
same is true for a large percentage of 
college athletes: We don’t lay down 
plans for future Olympic gold, but we 
dedicate twenty or more hours a week 
to training, competing, rehabilitat-
ing, and preparing for more training, 
competing and rehabilitating. And 
sometimes, it’s difficult.

Probably the most common issue 
that athletes run into is the sheer 
lack of time and energy needed to do 
much of anything other than classes, 
studying and competition. For some 
reason or another, UCSD athletes 
tend to have a reputation as wild par-
tiers on an otherwise relatively quiet 
campus. Although parties and other 
outings certainly do happen, a lot of 
athletes I know, even at notorious 
party school UC Santa Barbara, are so 
wiped out from a long week of classes 
and training that their ideal Friday 
night involves some tea, a warm bed 
and Netflix Instant.

The lack of free time can also 
restrict athletes’ abilities to accept job 
and internship opportunities. I’m one 
of the lucky ones, with a job I love 
and a supervisor who understands 
and tries her best to work around my 
schedule. Others are not so lucky. An 
old friend and competitor of mine, 
who now runs for the University of 
Miami, is one of those people whom 
one envies and kind of wants to hate, 
but can’t. She is beautiful, extremely 
talented, has a 3.8 GPA, and is one 
of the most selfless people I’ve ever 
met. But despite her intelligence and 
work ethic, she can’t hold down a job 
because she just doesn’t have enough 
time with a sport in her schedule.

Now, add onto that the stress 
that comes with collegiate competi-
tion. Athletes train five or six days a 
week all year, with maybe two weeks 
to one month for rest during the 
off-season. But the average college 
athlete can anticipate a whole year’s 
worth of pain, sweat, scrapes, bruises, 
pulled muscles, broken bones, com-
parisons to better athletes, articles on 
how to improve performance, sac-
rificed dates or even sacrificed boy-
friends and girlfriends — all of that 
comes down to a 10-second race. A 
40-minute game. A two-hour match. 
Coaches are watching, families are 
watching, friends are watching as that 
athlete tries to apply a year’s worth of 
all of that crap into one moment.

That gets pretty darn stressful.
So with the lack of time, the

CROSS COUNTRY  — The UCSD 
Men’s and Women’s Cross Country 
teams competed at the 2012 NCAA 
Division II West Regionals in 
Kuhuku, Hawaii on Saturday, Nov. 
3. The UCSD Men’s team finished 
their 10k race in 10th place with a 
team score of 266, while the women 
finished their 6k race in 12th place 
with a team score of 384.

Junior Kellen Levy led the UCSD

Scott Acton in 68th place with a 
time of 34:53 and Eddie Carrillo, 
who placed 79th with a time of 
35:12.

Chico State, ranked third in the 
nation, won the title with a team 
score of 38, placing three runners 
in the top five slots and all their 
remaining runners placing in the 
top 20. Alaska Anchorage, hoping 
to win a third straight regional title, 
finished second with a cumulative 
score of 46. Western Washington, 
San Francisco State and Humboldt 

State teams placed 
third, fourth and fifth, respec-
tively, to advance to the NCAA 

Championships with Chico State 
and Alaska Anchorage.

In the women’s 6k race, junior 

Chia Chang led the Tritons with 
a time of 22:48 to place 30th. In 
68th place, UCSD freshman Marie 
Diaz came in with a time of 23:37, 
while freshman Carolina Guzman 
finished with a time of 24:09 to 
place 84th. Senior Elena Inouye fol-
lowed in 95th place with a time of 
24:30 and sophomore Michelle Le 
Roux clocked in at 25:04 to finish 
in 117th place, allowing the UCSD 
team to place 12th out of 25 teams.

The Chico State women also 
won their race with a team score 
of 51 to beat Sonoma State with 56 
points as well as preventing Alaska 
Anchorage from obtaining a fourth 
consecutive regional title.

While UCSD will not be in atten-
dance this year, the 2012 NCAA 
Championships will take place on 
Saturday, Nov. 17th at Missouri 
Southern State in Joplin, Missouri.

The Tritons will graduate senior 
Elena Inouye from the women’s 
cross country team, while all the 
runners from the men’s team will be 
continuing at UCSD, allowing for a 
strong roster in next year’s competi-
tive season.
