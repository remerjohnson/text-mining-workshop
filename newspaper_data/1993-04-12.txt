DAVIS - Women students and 
faculty worked over spring 
break to convince UC Davis 
administrators not to follow 
through with their proposal to 
drastically cut funding to the 
Women's Resources and 
Research Center. Vice Chancel-
lor of Student Affairs Frank 
Rincon announced March 12 
that the center's funding would 
be substantially reduced and its 
duties reassigned to other 
Student Affairs units. Student 
Affairs has proposed a 49 
percent cut to the $127,000 it 
currently allocates to the center. 

UCR Offers Ph.D. 
In Dance IIstory 
RIVERSroE - UC Riverside 
is dancing on the cutting edge 
with the nation's first doctorate 
in dance history. The program 
begins next fall and is an 
extension of the presently 
existing intercampus master of 
ans degree in dance history. 
Dance Depanment Chair Susan 
Foster has high aspirations for 
the program, which she hopes 
will establish UCR as an 
international center for dance 
research. "It 's the first doctor-
ate level program in the 
country to address issues of 
dance's significance," Foster 
said.

Graffiti is spreading beyond the

Plaza expression board and 
the administration is paying 
heavy costs. Known as "tags," 
these spray paint designs are 
making their way onto steps 
and walls, as well as walls at 
other parts of campus. Accord-
ing to UCSB Facilities 
Management employee John 
Zordano, the amount of graffiti 
correlates with current events. 
Campus police are urging the 
public to keep an eye out for 
spray paint cans and to report 
"tags" in progress.

Siwabessy Elected President in Landslide 
ELEC1ION: 'Student Action Now!' slate sweeps; five 
percent voter turnout is the lowest in UCSD history 

Also winning under the Student 
Action Now slate were Vice Presi-

didate Neena Malik, Vice President 
External candidate Nicholas Endres, 
Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
candidate John Barnes, Commis-
sioner of Communications candi-

Operations candidate Greg Bakken 
and Commissioner of Student Ad-
vocacy candidate Matthew Winter. 

By francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

All eight candidates running un-
der the "Student Action Now!" slate 
were elected in last week's Associ-
ated Students general election. 

Turnout for the three-day elec-
tion fell just short of fi ve percent, or 
740 out of the more than 14,800 
undergraduates. 

Current Vice President Admin-
istrative Randolph Siwabessy beat 
Third College Council Chair James 
Hill and Revelle Senior Senator D.A. 
Bartolotta by capturing 59.3 per-
cent of the vote. Hill placed second 
with 22.9 percent, and Bartolotta 
finished third with 17.9 percent. 

Siwabessy said he was pleased 

with the slate's clean sweep. He 
referred to a unified council as key 
to the quick implementation of many 
of his proposals when the new coun-
cil takes power in two weeks. 

"The link is established early 
on ... we're going to have a headstart 
[over previous boards]," he said. 

The first priorities of the new 
administration are to meet with stu-
dent groups and to familiarize new 
council members with the system, 
according to Siwabessy. He added 
that the executive budget is also 
taking a top spot on the agenda.

TAS1EBUD: UCSD researchers may have stumbled upon the fIrst 
inorganic tongue, silicon that can taste the difference between chemicals 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

U CSD chemists have con-structed tiny "inorganic tongues n of silicon which may lead to wristwatch-sized chemical sensors to 
detect everything from alcohol on 
the breath to carcinogens in gaso-
line. 

If UCSD Chemistry l'rofessor 
Michael Sailor's postulate is right, 
wafer-thin pieces of silicon the size 
of microchips would be able to 
sense chemicals much the way 
human tongues taste chemicals in 
food. 

Such microchips could then be 
installed in watch-sized, dispos-
able detectors. Although much 
more sensitive detectors are cur-
rently on the market, Sailor said 
they are generally too large and 
expensive for general use. 

The cheaper silicon sensors 
could be used by police in place of 
the Breathalyzer, by miners to de-

tect poison gases and by those 
interested in detecting toxins in 
their environment. 

The inorganic tongue originates 
from a recently discovered prop-

~rty of silicon - that etched, p0-
rous silicon glows reddish-orange 
under the influence of ultraviolet 
light. The unexplained glow could 
revolutionize the computer indus-
tries dependent on silicon. 

In the case of the inorganic 
tongue, the glow is dimmed by the 
presence of certain chemicals, in-
dicating that the color and bright-
ness of the glow could be used to 
detec t those chemicals. Jeff 
Lauerhaas, a graduate student in 
Sailor's lab, has found that ilicon' s 
response to chemicals can be pre-
dicted. 

"The idea was, [to] do chemis-
try on [silicon] surfaces and ma-
nipUlate the response of the sur-
face by manipulating the chemis-
try of the surface," Sailor said. If 
the surface proves too difficult to

CAMPUS: Discussion centers on 
budget crisis and fee hikes 
By Chris .Jensen 
Associate News Editor 

Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate Affairs 
Joseph Watson and representatives from Career 
Services and Student Financial Services held an 
open forum to discuss fee increases with stu-
dents last Thursday at the Price Center. 

Watson said the meeting was designed to 
alleviate some of the anxiety that the higher fees 
have caused for students. 

While the fee increases will be a heavy 
burden on students, "the university clearly has 
an obligation to students to meet that burden," 
Watson said. 

He stressed that one-third of the money 
raised by the fee increases will be returned to 
students as financial aid. 

Maura Robbins and Ann Klein of Student 
Financial Services and Neil Murray of Career 
Services discussed changes in the financial aid 
system. 

Klein said that home equity will no longer be 
considered in the formula for evaluating finan-
cial need, alJowing many middle-class students 
to receive aid next year. 

'Students who might not be eligible [for 
financial aid] this year may be eligible next 
year," Klein said. 

She also mentioned UCSD's deferred pay-
tnent plan, which was instituted last quarter. The 
plan allows students to pay their registration 
fees in three installments per quarter. 

Robbins said student loans not based on need 
will also be available next year, although the 
federal government will not pay the interest on 
such loans. 

She stressed that students should not assume 
that they are ineligible for financial assistance 
and instead work with the financial aid office on 
an individual basis . 

Murray, who heads Career Services, said em-
ployment will continue to be an important source 
of financial aid for students. 

He said 60 percent of UCSD students work 
during the school year, making the university 
second among UC campuses in percentage of 
students employed.

Gesson said that because of rising 
student fees and other crucial issues, 
students "have come to the point 
where they feel they have absolutely 
no control within the UC system." 
. Gesson said that while she can-
not change student apathy ,she plans 
to begin altering the A.S. election 
bylaws. 

Citing the current structure as 

needlessly confining and geared to-
ward a school with a much smaller 
student !>ody, Gesson said an ex-
tended campaign period. issue-ori-
ented debates and more flexiblecam-
paign restrictions would lead to a 
more dynamic election process. 

However, she noted that the pro-
cess, if successful, may take up to a

By Ben Lavine, Staff Writer 
o many of Bill Clinton's 
conservative critics, govern-
ment "investment in 
America's economy" is just a 
euphemism for more tax-and-
spend welfare policies, a 
notorious label that has stuck 
with the Democratic Party for 
many years now. But part of 
the president's overall 
stimulus package to bolster' 

the economy is a plan 10 boost industrial productivity. 
Clinton hopes to introduce to the American economy its 
flTSt industrial policy to increase such productivity. His 
efforts to put his foot in the water should be com-
mended, but what America needs is a comprehensive 
industrial policy that reflects and meets America's size 
and invesunent demand. 

As the world's economies become more integrated 
in a global market, microeconomic management is 
becoming less sufficient to guarantee our competitive-
ness in the marketplace. Both Germany and Japan have 
created successful industrial policies. where the 
government participates not only in research and 
development of new technologies, but also in ensuring 
smooth relations between business leaders and labor. 

We already have policies that reflect the 
government's participation in the industrial sector: 
subsidies to businesses, research grants, defense 
contracts and tax deductions. But these policies lack 
coordination and are constantly subject to special 
interests. Somehow, Clinton needs to not only form 
new policies to encourage technological advances in 
promising industries, but also coordinate and establish a 
coherent policy on existing programs. 

Critics of industrial policy have attacked 
government's participation in encouraging investment 
and productivity. Their main argument is the classical 
expression of laissez{aire, where the private forces in

the market know what is best for the economy. They 
cite previous unsuccessful attempts to regulate and 
nationalize certain industries. For instance, Britain's 
attempt in the '70s to invest in supersonic transpolt was 
a fiscal failure. 

Given this sobering experience, how does govem-
ment know which industries to subsidize and which to 
let die out? And if a comprehensive industrial policy 
were formed, how can the government ensure its 
coordination without turning into another bloated, 
inefficient bureaucratic entity? 

As it stands, the recovery from this recession hasn't 
even matched previous growth cycles. Over the past si)( 
recessions, average growth over the seven following 
quarters has been five percent. In contrast, average 
growth for this recovery has been a stagnant 2.3 percent 
while factory capacity is still only at 79 percent. 
Leading indicatQrs for this quarter are also pretty slim. 
With the economy in such a bad stale, the United States 
not only has to shore up its debts so that it may , 
establish adequate credit, but it needs to provide a kick-
start to the economy in the form of provided capital to 
get businesses going again. 

But America is having a hard time meeting its 
investment demand right now. A recurring trend in a 
recession is the rise in a nation's savings rate as both 
consumers and businesses look to save money and cut 
waste. But according to the Wall Street Joul7Ull, 
America's savings rate has been an abysmal 4.8 
percent, not much of an increase as America creeps out 
of this receSsion. 

In macroeconomic termS, savings has a large impact 
on long-term investment. Money needed for investment 
is now not only spent on high rates of consumption, but 
also on our huge national debt. As it is, America has not 
reached its steady-state potential in capital growth, 
meaning we are lagging behind in technological 
advances and growth in the key sectors of industry and 
the economy. More troubling, America is nor reaching

FORGET THE PICKS-How ABOUT SOME RESPONSmLE JOURNAIJSM? 
Editor: 

[ am deeply upset by the incred-
ibly biased article written on the A.S. 
Elections ("Battle of the Ballot," April 
5). As the main newspaper on cam-
pus, you should concern yourselves 
on practicing responsible journalism. 
Giving your "picks" was in no way 
necessary or pertinent to the article. 
To go on, you provided a very one-
sided perspective on each of your 
picks. I trust you not to report just the 
facts you would like to include, but all 
the facts - unbiasedly. This you did 
not do. There is a pattem of strong 
support for "Student Action Now!" 
throughout your picks. A more ap-
propriate article should have been 
about "Student Action Now!" and 
what this group could bring to the 
A.S. Council. 

I am very tired of seeing journal-
ism and all the media throw their 
weight around in ordertocontrol poli-
tics at every level. Are we so stupid 
that we cannot form our own opin-
ions? Next time, leave out your cute 
little pictures of who you would like 
to win, and try not to dress up your 
picks while you tear down any quali-
fications of their opposition. Please, 
clean up your act!

Editor's Note: The "anicle" that 

has raised Mr. Schecter's jre is, in 
actuality, a commentmy and clearly 
labeled as such. A commentalY rep-
resents the viewpoints of the writer, 
or in this case,the views of the Guard-
ian editorial board. The editorial 
hoard is made lip of the editor in chief, 
managing editor, news editor and 

opinion edilor.lncluding our opinion 
in a commentary is perfectly within 
the boundm-ies of "responsible jour-
nalism." 

Tum It Off, Matt 
Editor: 

If Matt Robinson is so disgusted 
by what he sees on television (''These 
Days, [t'sAllTaik and No Suhstance," 
April I), then why doesn't he just 
change the damn channel and watch 
Rush Limbaugh? God was thinking 
of nit-pickers like Mr. Robinson when 
he created the cable-ready television 
and the remote control. 

The "low level of moronic and 
lascivious programming that goes into 
the modem talk show" is the result of 
market research indicating the desire 
for such a program. It is obviously 
true that the majority of Geraldo' s 
programs can be less than intelligible. 
Butifnobodyappreciatedsuchashow, 
or simply if nobody watched it, then it 
would be cut from the air immedi-
ately. If the viewing audience didn't 
applaud such blockheads as Sally 
Jessy, Oprah and Rush, then they 
wouldn't be on the air. 

Furthermore, this kind of deviant-
promoting talk show is American 
media at its finest. How would one 
know that "lesbian sex clubs" exist 
unless Oprah was eager to parade 
tlJem on national television? The value 
of knowing that such a group exists is 
probably miniscule, but that is de-
cided by each viewer, not the great 
overseer of intelligent programming, 
Mr. Robinson.

Mr. Robinson's commentary re-
minds me of a complaint often made 
by my mother. She is shocked by 
each week's new National Enquirer 
because, in her view, the press vio-
lates some over-exposed celebrity's 
right to privacy by printing a picture 
of the celebrity naked, drunk or na-
ked and drunk. But, I will tell Mr. 
Robinson just as I tell M.s>mmy, if no 
one read or watched that crap, then 
the exploitative tabloid press would 
have no reason for its existence.

fonowing phrases written on it: "2nd 
Amendment special," "Cult .45" and 
"PraisetiJe Lord and Pass the Ammo. " 
The caption below the picture, which 
was most disturbing, read "Another 
wacko to thank the NRA for." 

To blame the NRA or Colt for this 
person's actions in Waco, Texas is 
absolutely ridiculous. The NRA does 
not advise Mr. Koresh's cult, and il 
did not tell him to kill people. The 
NRA supports American values and 
law and order. II does not condone 
illegal action or resistance 10 law en-
forcement. Mr. Spong seems to think 
that the NRA is responsible for Mr. 
Koresh'scull, the Branch Davidians, 
firing upon BATF agents. Why not 
blame George Washington, Thomas 
Jefferson or some of the other found-
ing fathers? After a1llhey're the ones 
who wrote the Second Amendment 
into the U.S. Constitution. 

The NRA makes sure that law-
abiding citizens are not denied their 
constitutional right to keep and bear 
arms. MilIionsoflaw-abidingAmeri-
can citizens use guns for recreational 
purposes like target shooting, sport-
ing clays and hunting. There are, of 
course, people that use guns in crimes 
to hurt people, however, there are 
also many more peop'le who drink 
alcohol and use their cars to kill the 
innocent. Do we ban Budwei~r or 
sue the automakers? Of course not! 
We blame the individual who failed 
to usecommon sense and drove while 
under the influence. 

[ am further disturbed by the way 
in which the cartoon presents guns. 
Mr. Spong would have you think that 
only crazy and dangerous people own 
them, and this is completely untrue. 
While we do hear about little children 
who accidentally shoot themselves or 
gangscomminingdrive-by shootings, 
guns also save a lot of lives. 

The right 10 bear arms is a vital 
part of our American heritage. Any-
one who has researched the record of 
gun control will see that the highest 
crime rates occur in states with the 
strictest firearm laws. Twenty-five 

states allow anyone to buy a gun, 
strap it on and walk down the street 
with no permit of any kind. Some say 
it's crazy. However, four out of five 
U.S. murders are committed in tIJe 
other 25 states. So who is crazy? 
People like you, Mr. Spong.

UnfaIr Rap on Cops 
Editor: 

Gaye Johmon has unjustly claimed 
that tIJe investigation of the recenl kid-
nap of an African-American female 
(who escaped unharmed hours later) is 
a prime example of discrimination on 
the part of the UCSD Police Depart-
ment (''The Case oftlJe Missing Cops." 
March 3). To support her allegation of 
racism, Johnson compared this incident 
with the recent rape of the woman on 
Gihnan Drive: "'There was more infor-
mation released and publicized aboul 
the crime of an African-American male 
in an off-campus incident than tlJere was 
about a white male perpetralor on-cam-
pus." Cou\d this be because rape is a 
muchmoreseriouscrimethanthephysi-
cally harmless kidnapping that oc-
curred? 

Johnson also brought up an inci-
dent involving an African-American 
Third student and a parking officer. 
When tIJe student attempted to escape 
the consequences of his unintelligent 
decision to park illegally, the officer 
called for backup. Johnson believes 
that the arrival of six police cars on 
the scene was clearly racist. She fails, 
however, to understand that the park-
ing officer probably just called for 
"police assistance." He did not say, 
"It's a black guy, so you'd better send 
extra cars!" 

Johnson's claim that the UCSD 
Police Department discriminates be-
tween "cases involving white victims 
and cases involving b1ack victims" is an 
unfair, unproven and incorrect accusa-
tion against the law enforcement com-
munity and a feeble attempt at riding on 
the wake of the Rodney King trial.

POLICY: The 
United States needs to 
bolster its economy 
ContInued frGm .... 4 
its full efficient potential The credit 
crunch consumers and businesses face 
today along with a low rate of savings 
has effectively cut off mucb-needed 
capital to meet investment demands. 

If America is to grow in the long-
term, it must meet its investment de-
mand of capital and must boost its 
long-tenn productivity. A compre-
hensive industrial policy can accom-
plish both while meeting its critics' 
demands for efficient management. 

First. it would not necessarily be 
the government operating the policy 
because its authority would be del-
egatedtonon-govenunent operatives: 
business and labor leaders, as well as 
top economists. 

Industrial policy advocate Felix 
Rohatyn would call this a "tripartite 
Economic Development Board" 
whose representatives from business, 
labor and government would be ap-
pointed by the president. 

A similar working relationship 
already exists in Gennany, where 
business and labor leaders work with 
the government to help determine 
policies. Regional representatives can 
also be appointed to decentralize op-
erations in decision-making. 

Second, the policy wouldn't en-
compass the whole business sector 
right away. America can certainly 
dabble and experiment in certain in-
dustries without being a huge burden. 
Plus cuts in the defense sector. capital 
and resources can be concentrated 
into this program. 

Although many argue about the 
kinds of returns from a peace divi-
dend,theconversion wiU have to come 
about sooner or later. And there is 
plenty of waste in government spend-
ing that could otherwise be saved or 
used more efficiently. Disregarding 
the option of making these savings, 
the money can be reallocated toward 
industries' investment demands. 

The days of welfare spending, 
nationalization and inflated union 
wages are over. America must now 
realize that it is competing in a global 
trading environment which is grow-
ing increasingly hostile. If we are to 
remain on top, we must put behind 
our outdated convictions of 
micromanagement and entrust the 
govenunent to work with industry.

For unknown 
reasons, the sili-

Chemistry Professor 
Michael Sailor 
seems to prefer

Washington. 
• Areas where the 
light hits "rusts" and 
falls off into the 
solution, leaving flat 
layers. The depth of 
the layers depends 
on the brightness of 
the light. 
The image can then 
be seen on the 
silicon in the form of 
patterns of color. 
The picture looks 
oily because its color 
is derived the same 
way that soap 
bubbles and oil 

Rent Brucknel/GuMUl slicks are colored. 

ense 
The extremely flat 
layers allow light to 
interfere with itself, 
producing the color 
patterns. 

Silicon may prove to be instrumental in revolutionizing everything from Breathalyzers to computers 
ContInued from pee. 1 
manipulate, the sensor will not work commer-
cially. 

The focus of Sailor's group, though, is basic 
research, rather than commercial development. 
"We try to keep our heads above the trees and 
see where [our discoveries] might have an 
impact, but our focus is not to develop some 
widgetto use in bars or something," Sailor said. 

The development of the inorganic tongue 
began in 1991, when Sailor and a colleague 
found that the way images are etched into 
silicon affects what sort of light it will emit in 
c~trollable ways. 

Thus, by engraving a certain type of picture 
onto a silicon wafer, lhecoloroflightemitted by 
silicon can be manipulated. Sailor said. 

Using the discovery, Sailor and colleagues 
. began imprinting photographic images of Elvis 

Presley' and George Washington into tiny wa-
fers of silicon. The "photoetching" process was 
used to construct theories and practical applica-
tions of silicon's glow. 

Then, in a serendipitous find in Sailor's 
laboratory, graduate student COl)' Curtis 
watched the glowing silicon dull in the presence 
of alcohol. 

The unexpected dimming fascinated Sailor 
not only because of its potential applications, 
but also because it altered theories about why 
silicon g]ows. 

"If we splash some solvent on [silicon) like 
ethanol or benzene or other types of molecules, 
the luminescence goes away - the orange 
color goes black, or it will just dim slightly," 
Sailor said 

Sailor, Lauerhaas and graduate studentJulie 
Heiruich began conducting resean:h on the 
neWfound effect. They discovered that silicon 

luminescence is affected differently depend-
ing on which chemicals are used and in what 
concentration, a realization which led to the 
concept of the inorganic tongue. 

The more profound result of the discovel)' 
sheds light on the mysterious mechanism be-
hind silicon luminescence. The chemicals 
which dim silicon's reddish-orange light inter-
act only with the surface of the silicon without 
affecting the silicon's basic structure in any 
way. 

Therefore, the researchers reason,lumines-
cence happens at the surface of silicon. 

The theol)' which Sailor likes best involves 
the basic behavior of electrons in Cl)'stals such 
as the silicon network. 

Nonnal silicon is similar to graphite in 
pencil lead, since both have vel)' flat, shiny 
Cl)'stal structures. When silicon is subjected to 
an electric current in solution and then exposed 
to light, it "rusts" where the light hits it 

The rust falls off,leaving "trees" of porous 
silicon between two flat layers. "It's kind of 
like a forest of silicon trees where the floor of 
the forest is the tenninating end and the tops of 
the trees are also vel)' flat," Sailor said. 

When silicon is etched with images like 
Elvis Presley, its nonnal, interconnected crys-
raJ structure is intelTUpted by tiny pieces of cut 
silicon. 

It is the tiny pieces that cause the silicon to 
glow under ultraviolet light, according to 
Sailor's favorite theol)'. Electrons which are 
nOlmally free-ranging over the entire Cl)'stal of 
silicon become restricted into the tiny silicon 
boxes. 

In the "boxes," the electronS act more like 
waves than particles, and ~ waves of ultra-
violet light shone On those electron waves 

cause the silicon to glow. 
According to the 

theOl)', in the inorganic 
tongue, certain mol-
ecules become tempo-
rarily affixed to the sili-
con surface, altering the 
wave-like properties of 
the substance. 

Armed with both 
theol)' and experimen-
tal results, Sailorandcol-
leagues hope to control 
the reaction of silicon to 
light. Such reactions 
have potential applica-
tionsrangingfarbeyond ChemIstry ProfeIIor MIchael SaIlor (rfCht) 
the inorganic tongue. talks with student Jell l.8ueIhus. 

For example, Sailor said silicon could be 
used as a cheap, lightweight computer moni-
tor. Because silicon is already used extensively 
in computer microchips, silicon made to glow 
could be used in conjunction with fiber optics 
to make faster computers. 

Silicon could store infonnation in comput-
ers by the manipulation of its surface chemis-
ny,engraved toemitvarious wavelengths which 
can represent encoded infonnation. 

Sailor said the mechanism must first be 
fully understood before such- technology can 
be realized. In addition, the silicon tongue may 
be no 1flore than a glimmer in the eyes of the 
UCSD chemists. Unless the sensors can be 
made much more sensitive to different types of 
chemicals, the tongue may not worle. at all. 

"The main thing is to focus [on) a mecha-
nism that will allow us to make predictions 
about how to use the stuff and how to manipu-
late it," he said 

.. Under ultraviolet 
light, the image 
glows reddish-
orange and no longer 
looks oily. The glow 
swprised scientists 
and is still unex-
plained. 
• The dual colors 
produced by the 
ultraviolet light and 
interference patterns 
have many potential 
applications, includ-
ing improving 
computer effICiency.

BY ELAINE CAMUSO. STAFF WRITER 

OU 00 HAVE RIGIfTS," PROCLAIMS THE 
brochure in earnest and sincere tones as 
it describes UCSD's Associated Students 
Office of the Student Advocate. Warren 
sophomore Carla Tesak and the other 
champions of justice in the student 
advocate office want all students to know 
that they also have a protector of these 
individual rights - and that the Student 
Advocate, "the only campus agency 
which can actively represent student 

cases to the administration," is that protector. 
Although the Student Advocate has existed since the 

implementation of the current A.S. structure in 1977, Tesak 
believes that most students are'unaware of its power and 
accessibility. This is unfonunate, she says, because for some 
students, it has been a life·saver. 

"[ think the main role for the student advocate office is to 
be a liason berween the students and the staff and facUlty." 
explains Tesak, "because in such a big school, students get 
very overwhelmed by the bureaucracy. [just think students 
get lost in such a large number of classes, and so many 
students feel like just a number. so the Student Advocate 
OffICe is there to defend student rights. The students need to 
know that there is someone there who can help them ... 

The primary function of the Student Advocate is to 
represent students in their appeals and complaints against the 
university administration. They have represented students in

RIGHTS: Student 
Advocate helps 
students fight back 
ContInued from ... S1 
a range of cases, including grade 
appeals, charges of discrimination 
and harassment. financial aid 
bungles and questions regarding 
faculty responsibility. 

The services offered by the Stu-
dent Advocate have kept some stu-
dents from academic ruin. Lisa, a 
Muir senior, claims, "I would not be 
graduating this year if not for the 
Student Advocate." Lisa asked to be 
identified only by her first name be-
cause some details of her case are still 
being worked out. 

Last Spring Quarter, Lisa was un-
able to complete a final examination, 
which counted for 60 percent of the 
course grade, because of illness. Her 
professor allowed her to take a make-
up exam over the summer. To Lisa's 
astonishment, the professor later de-
cided to give her a failing grade rather 
than allow the make-up test to count. 
"I felt devastated," recalls Lisa. " I 
was really upset. I didn't think that it 
was fair that I should get an 'F'."

Lisa heard about the Student Advo-
cate through a friend and decided to 
approach the office with her problem. 
According to Lisa. "the professor was 
not going to change her mind" But 
the Student Advocate met with the 
Muir College provost and dean and 
the chair of the department in which 
Lisa took the class, until the professor 
finally backed down and decided to 
allow the summer make-up exam to 
count toward a passing grade. 

Lisa says that if she had attempted 
to argue the grade change herself, she 
feels that her provost and other ad-
ministrators would have been unre-
ceptive and less willing to act on her 
case. "Carla saved my life," she says. 
"I urge students to utilize the student 
advocate." 

The Student Advocate helped 
Warren junior Janice Morrow cut 
through the mounds of administrative 
red tape that threatened her status as a 
full-time student. As a new transfer 
student last quarter, she found herself 
unaccustomed to UCSD bureaucratic 
rituals. Morrow was "kind of clueless" 
about the stringent rules on adding 
and dropping classes, and six weeks 
into the quarter she still hadn't offi-
cially enrolled in two of the fourclasses 
she had been attending. Not only had

she missed the regular deadline for 
adding classes, she had also 
inadvertantly missed the fmal day to 
petition to add her classes at the last 
minute. 

At that point, she says, Warren 
College administrators curtly in-
fonned her that it was too late to add 
the classes, despite the fact that her 
professors were more than willing to 
let her in. If she did not enroll in the 
classes, the distraught Morrow knew 
she would be disqualified from re-
ceiving her financial aid and would 
also be unable to take the upper-<livi-
sion courses she would need to com-
plete her major in time. 

Upon the urging of a friend. she 
approached the Student Advocate with 
her problem. The office immediately 
took over the situation, writing letters 
to the Warren administration and 
scheduling meetings with advisors. "I 
was very impressed," says Morrow. 
"The Student Advocate called me al-
most daily to let me know what was 
happening. They can plead your case 
in a lot more of a professional manner 
than you can." 

Eventually, Warren College al-
lowed her to add the classes. "I had no 
idea I could fight it," says Morrow. "I 
understand Warren 's point of view 

SPECTACLE S3 

- they don't want you to be flalcey, 
but this was an honest mistake. The 
Student Advocate helped me so 
much." 

In addition to T esak, four assis-
tant student advocates round out the 
staff. 

"We can go from just telling stu-
dents what office they need to go to, to 
completely representing them in a 
hearing," Tesak says. "When some-
one comes to us, though, we see if we 
can refer them. We provide represen-
tation, or just infonnation or research. 
We can do a lot of the leg work for 
students. That's why our office is 
there. Many students don't have the 
time to look up all these things and do 
the research on their cases, and I have 
my assistants for that." 

Litigation for many of the office's 
cases runs through various on-cam-
pus courts, including the college judi-
cial boards, the college councils and 
the CEP Sub-Comminee on Grade 
Appeals, a board which reviews grade 
appeals based on non-academic crite-
ria. 

Tesale. says that the administration 
listens to the Office of the Student 
Advocate more than it would an indi-
vidual student.

"Many professors, ormany people 
that we deal with, won't listen to a 
student very much, but when a com-
plaint comes on A.S. letterhead, they 
pay attention," says Tesak. "We have 

a very good working relationship with 
all the provosts and deans. so we 
coordinate our efforts, and that's 
something that a lot of students don't 
have the time to establish." 

Tesak was appointed to her lead-
ership position in November, 1992, 
after serving last year as an assistant 
student advocate. During the remain-
der of that quarter, the office handled

ter. Since returning to school this quar-
ter' the staff has already committed to 
at least two cases. Tesak divides the 
workload between herself and her 
assistants, and the issues coordinator 
takes care of research for the rest of 
the staff. 

The Student Advocate has to ac-
cept all cases submitted, whether or 
not the staff bel ieves a particular case 
is valid. So far, Tesale says, all of her 
cases have been built on solid ground. 
and she emphasizes the necessity for 
complete honesty between the office 
and the students it represents. 

"I try to impress upon students that 
they need to be honest with me be-
cause if we have people lying to us 
and we fmd these things out, it jeop-
ardizes the integrity and tbe reputa-
tion oftheoffice,"Tesale says, adding 
that the only way she CaJI drop a case 
is if the student is caught lying to the 
office about the facts of the case. 

"If someone has lied to me greatly, 
and I feel that they're putting the 
name of the office in jeopardy -
which puts the other students who 
come to us in jeopardy - I will say, 
'You lied to me. I will not represent 
you anymore.' But that hasn't hap-
pened yet," Tesak continues.

"The year before I was an assis-

dent was saying that a professor had 
harassed her, and they asked her, 'Has 
this ever happened to you before?' 
She was filing some sort of appeal, 
and it turned out she had filed, in one 
year, seven appeals like that one. This 
was why they weren't listening to her 
anymore. The appeals were found to 
be unfounded and hearsay, but she 
failed to mention that," recalls Tesak.

from wrongful accusations of student

The amount of time it takes to 
senle each case depends upon its indi-
vidual circumstances, and whether or 
not the Student Advocate can suc-
cessfully negotiate the case without a 
formal hearing or trial. An agreement 
can be reached in as linle a few days 
or as long as several months, reports 
Tesak. 

In a recent example, the Student 
Advocate Office itself filed and pur-
sued a complaint against the univer-
sity. Citing what it deemed an ex-
ample of the wasteful administrative 
bureaucracy, the office condemned 
the practice of sending students a 
"bill" which lists their balance as zero 
after they have already paid their fees. 

Last quarter, a student filed a c1ean-
liness complaint against Dining Ser-
vices, and the Student Advocate Of-
fice arranged to conduct a surprise 
inspection of the campus dining fa-
cilities with eight A.S. council mem-
bers. The group was relieved to dis-
cover that university-operated dining 
facilities are inspected monthly and 
are kept clean. Butto their dismay , the 
self-appointed inspectors found that 
the restaurants in the Price Center are 
officially inspected only once a year, 
if that often. 

"The student came in thinking, 
'This whole system is gross and I hate 
the food and it's sick and you shou Id 
look into it,''' Tesak says. "We did, 
and he came along on these inspec-
tions. and he saw these repons they 
gave us [from the health inspector]. I 
still consider this case a success be-
cause the student was pleased with 
what he found, and we also got him 
this position on the committee, where 
he is making changes. " 

PARTICIPANTS NEEDED. "We have some cases that have taken many months. They're very 
complicated because we're very per-
sistent. Sometimes the first answer is 
'No way,' and we keep at it, we keep 
at it, we keep at it. So we defmitely 
fight for students ... a student gets in-
timidated very easily."

"All I can say is we do try to work 
very efficiently and diligently. The 
cases that take long are the cases 
where we keep hearing 'No! No!' and

LECTURE: 
Litigators discuss 
government abuse 
ContInued from pace 3 
apartment. 

Bivens filed a lawsuit charging 
the agents with search and arrest 
without a warrant and excessive use 
offorce. In the high court's prece-
dent-setting decision, the officers 
were held personally responsible 
for violating Bivens' constitutional 
rights. 

Until the case reached the Su-
preme Court, Bivens represented 
himself without the aid of an attor-
ney. 

Bivens took a harsh stand against 
law-enforcement organizations in 
his speech. 

"Seventy-five percent of all p0-
lice forces in the country take prop-
erty to fmance their organizations," 
he said. 

''They take your property be-
cause they can. 1bere's no way to 
fight back." 

Bivens, now 65, plans to enter 
law school in the fall in order to 
"learn the ways oflawyers from the 
inside." 

He promised never to quit his 
struggle against the government. 

"I'll fight the government until 
they say 'Uncle, .. ' he said. 

Rider fought a successful legal 
battle to repeal the one-half cent 
"jail tax" approved by San Diego 
County in 1987. The money from 
the tax, which was intended to fund 
the construction of new prison fa-
cilities that Rider considered unnec-
essary, was instead diverted to in-
crease the salaries of county em-
ployees. 

Rider's controversial victory 
saved San Diego County taxpayers 
$1.2 billion. However, Rider is still 
attempting to force the county to 
repay the $380 million that was 
collected before the decision. 

A bill that is now up for approval 
in the state legislature is a,n attempt 
to redressRider's grievance through 
a combination of refunds andathree-
quarters of a percent reduction in 
the state sales tax. 

Rider closed his speech with an 
attack against asset forfeiture, which 
he called "the scariest part of the 
Americanjudicial system." 

"Everybody in America today 
faces the prospect of having their 
assets taken away without due pro-
cess, without conviction," he said. 

"Police realized that this would 
be a tremendous opportunity. This 
is an opportunity to fund their orga-
nizations like they've never funded 
them before."

Lancers Boil UCSD, 14-4 
BUFB" , • Tritons' four 
game win streak ends 
By Jeff PnIught 
St8ff Writer 

In a disappointing fmish to an other-
wise encouraging week, the UCSD 
baseball team ttaveled north to face Cal 
Baptist on Thursday, only 10 get 
slammed, 144, ending the Trilon win-
ning streak at four games. 

Although the Tritons (10-11-1) had 
come off back-to-back victories over 
the University of Redlands, they looked 
physically and emotionally spent dur-
ing their game against the Lancers, their 
third in three days. UCSD sent fresh-
man Ben Mangan to the hill, where he 
got into trouble eMly and often. 

Cal Baptist batted around in the first 
irming, putting together four lUllS on 
four hits, including a two-run single by 
Man Mussleman. Mangan was touched 

Ben Mangan w. up. 
for another run in the second, and two 
m<Xe in the fourth, when Marc Abrams 
took over. 

Freshman Abrams was ripped for 
six lUllS in two-thirds of an irming. Cal 
Baptist batted around again, with the 
rally fueled by alWO-run blast off the bat 
of DH Sean Boissiere, and a bases-

loaded double by Mussleman. 
Offensively, UCSDwasledbyOuis 

Miyake, who had a pair of doubles in 
fourat-bals, and Pat Hart. UCSO'sfll'St 
run was generared by a solo home run 
off the bel of GIeM Nahmias in the 
second inning. In the fifth, Han singled 
to score Miyake. UCSO made the score 
144 in the ninth when three Lancer 
errors allowed Jason Aguilar to score, 
and Hart foUowedwitha two-oot single, 
scoring Miyake. 

Mangan took the loss for UCSD, 
dropping his!'eCQlti to I-I. Cal B8JXist 
ace Scott Gratt picked up the victory, 
tossing a complete game and allowing 
only two earned runs, fanning six. 

Head Coach Lyle Yates was not 
surprised by the outcome. 'They had 
Grant going, who earlier in the year 
a1most threw a no-hitter against lIS, so 
we knew it might be a long day. He may 
be the bestpitcherin NAIA." said Y aleS.

But It's a ReaDy 
Nice Bus ••• 

In a surprise move yesrerday, the 
Padres announced that !hey traded all-
star first baseman Fred MdJriff to the 
MonIreal Expos for a bus. 

"Look, it's a really, really good 
bus," explained exasperated Padres 
owner Tom Wentc'. '11 gets good 
miles-pcr-gallon and handles well. 
Besides, paying McGriff is just too 
dam expensive. Why throw money 
hand over fist at quality ballplayers 
when we can get a bus and save a 
couple of million in.stead?" 

Actually, the troubles in Padreland 
are yet to reach a point where top 
players are being dealt away for buses 
(team planes, maybe, but not buses). 
McGriff will be around for awhile, or 
at least until Padre brass decide that a 
player who can hit 30 home runs isn't 
worth $2 million. But it is safe to say 
that with their off-season fu-esale, the 
Padres have become the laughingstock 
of baseball. It will take a stellar effort 
from the Pads just to keep ahead of the 
expansion Colorado Rockies. 

What exactly happened here? The 
Padres were an exciting, competitive 
team last year, staying with the Atlanta 
Braves until August Then, manage-
ment decreed that the team payroll had 
to be cut, and if that meant fielding a 
team of little leaguers, then so be it 

Pitcher Craig Lefferts was traded. 
while the Padres were still in conten-
tion no less. All-star Tony Fernandez 
was shipped off to the Mets for future 
Hall-of-Famers Wally Whitehurst and 
DJ. Dozier (according to several 
scouting reports, the only way Dozier 
will see action in the major leagues is if 
he starts saving up for season tickets). 
Benito Santiago, Randy Myers and 
Damn Jackson - they're all gone too, 
either through more bonehead trades or 
free agency. And that leaves the Padres 
with a group of second-stringers in the 
starting lineup and an almost guaran-
teed finish in the second division. 

Naturally, somebody is to blame 
for this fiasco, and nonnally it would 
be General Manager Joe Mclllvaine. 
But listen carefully to McDlvaine 
during his interviews - he absolutely 
hates making these trades. He cries 
himself to sleep each night, yearning 
for the sweet release of death rather 
than face another day laboring aboard 

thePadres' deathship.Mcruv~ 
would have loved to keep Jackson, 
Fernandez and the adler guys (or at 
least gotten something in return for 
them), but he has no choice in the 
matter - the owners are practically 
holding a gun to his head. 

So the blame rests squarely on the 
shoulders of Tom Werner, the principal 
player among the 15 Padre owners. 
Werner claims to be acting in the best 
interests of the team, publicly wnnging 
his hands, shrugging his shoulders and 
saying, "Nothing! can do about it, folks." 
Werner believes that the Padres, being a 
small-market tearn, are unable to swim 
with the big fishes, and have to cut their

Tritons Shaft UCI in Four 
\IOUDBALL: UCSD Colleds FJI'St 
Divisioo I win in two years 
By Blair Rlcley 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's volleyball team won its second 
match of the year on Friday night, defeating the 
visiting UC Irvine Anteaters in four games, 15-7, 15-
10,2-15, 15-9. The victory was the team's second in 
its last three matches. 

Steve Kremser led the way for the Tritons with a 
team-high 20 kills. 

UCSD looked strong from the beginning, using 
strong defense and excellent hitting to capture the flJ'St 
game easily, 15-7. 

The Anteaters picked up their game in the Second, 
but could not outlast the more powerful Tritons who 
claimed the game, 15-\0. Toward the end of the game, 
players from both squads began to lose their cool and 
argued under the net. . 

The altercation seemed to hW1 the Tritons, dimin-
ishing their concentration and slowing their momen-
tum. They lost, 15-2. 

UCSD Head Coach Rod Wilde used the inter-
game timeout wisely and made sure his team was 
ready for the next game. 

The Tritons responded with a 15-9 victory in the 
fourth game, clinching the match. 

Matt Minehan also had a strong match, compiling 
a team-hgh .364 rutting percentage. He also added 6 
kills. 

The win upped UCSD's season record to 2-21 
overnU, and 1-14 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federa-
tior -.latches. UeI dropped to 2-17 overall and 1-15 in 
th \i1PSF. 

Wilde was very pleased with his squad's effort on 
Friday. "This was the fIrSt time we put together a 

Steve Kremser had 20 kills for UCSD. 
complete complement on the court and played a 
complete match. It's a big breakthrough for us. I'm 
really happy for the guys," Wilde said. 

The Triton victory was the first Division I victory 
for the men's volleyball team in two years. 

The Tritons will finish off the season with four 
road matches. They will travel to Honolulu to take on 
the Rainbows of the University of Hawaii on April 16-
17. After that, the team will travel nonh to face the 
University of the Pacific on April 23 and Stanford 
University on April 24. 

Wilde made it clear that the UOP match will be a 
big one for UCSD since a victory against the Tigers 
would ensure a fmish out of the cellar. The coach 
would like his team to fInish as the best of the bottom 
three tearns in the MPSF, ua, UOP and UCSD.
