In the midst of California’s 
worst drought crisis in decades, 
UCSD departments are taking 
steps to reduce the campus’s water 
consumption.

Through the implementation of 
the comprehensive California Water 
Action Plan that began in December 
2013, UCSD has been attempting to 
reduce campuswide potable -water 
use by 20 percent. Several projects 
that will begin in the months ahead 
include installation of high-efficiency 
fixtures, low-flow devices and 
artificial turf at Muir Field. These 
changes also extend to the greater 
San Diego area with the installation 

of laminar water-flow devices at the 
Hillcrest Medical Center.

In April 2014, Chancellor Pradeep 
K. Khosla announced a water 
-conservation theme to UCSD’s 
annual Earth Week.

“Changes in our daily habits are 
essential if we are to successfully 
face the water challenges ahead,” 
Khosla said in an April 2014 campus 
notice sent via email. “Sustainability 
is an integral part of UC San Diego’s 
education, research and campus 
operations.”

The UCSD Water Action Plan also 
includes the use of recycled -water 
irrigation, xeriscaping (planting 
greenery that requires low water), 
storm-water management and eco-
friendly cleaning products.

Changes instituted to help curb 

UCSD’s water consumption are in 
compliance with local law regarding 
the “wasting” of water. According 
to Section 67.3803 of the San Diego 
Municipal Code, wasting water is 
illegal at all times, even when drought 
response levels are not in effect. 
Continual water wasting can result 
in an increase in penalties and a 
complete shutoff of water service. 

Since Governor Jerry Brown’s 
announcement of the drought in 
January 2014, he has signed three 
bills that will “create the framework 
for sustainable, local groundwater 
management for the first time in 
California history,” according to a 
statement released by the governor’s 
office Sept. 16.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill last 
week that will allow for the temporary 
removal of firearms from individuals 
who are judged to be at risk of 
committing violent acts. 

The provisions of the bill stipulate 
a “Gun Violence Restraining 
Order” to be placed on individuals 
when there is clear and convincing 
evidence that firearm owners are at 
risk of committing violence against 
themselves or others. 

The bill, AB 1014, was authored 
by California Assemblymembers Das 
Williams and Nancy Skinner and 
passed the Senate floor and Assembly 
on Aug. 27 and Aug. 29, respectively. 

“The bill will not be able to 
eliminate gun violence,” Williams told 
the UCSD Guardian. “But many more 
lives will be saved as a result of it.”

Immediate family members and 
individuals who have lived with a 
person for more than six months may 
petition a judge to issue a GVRO, 
which inhibits individuals from 
possessing, selling or purchasing a 
firearm for 21 days. 

“If an individual has lived with 
the person behaving in a concerning 
manner for less than six months, they 
cannot present evidence,” Williams 
said. “However, they can ask a police 
officer to examine the evidence and 
present it to a judge.”

After the 21-day period, the GVRO 
can be removed or extended up to 
one year after a court hearing. Upon 
expiration or revocation of a GVRO, 
an individual regains his or her right to 
purchase or possess a firearm.

The law also states that utilizing 
false evidence to petition a GVRO 
is a misdemeanor. If an individual 
knowingly violates a GVRO, they 
will be charged with a misdemeanor 
and another GVRO will be placed on 
them for a 5-year period, following the 
expiration of the existing GVRO.

Law enforcement officers may 
request that a judge place an immediate 
21-day GVRO on any person after 
investigating a report on that person 
from any citizen concerned about 
threats or suspicious behavior.

Although Williams and Skinner 
brought the bill to the California 
Senate five days after Santa Barbara 
City College student Elliot Rodger 
shot and killed six people at Isla Vista 
in May  2014, the bill had originally 
been introduced in February 2013. 
According to Williams, Rodger’s 
roommates noticed suspicious 
behavior but failed to report it.

UC  SYSTEM

Napolitano: Regents May 
Discuss Tuition Hikes

University of California President Janet Napolitano held a press conference with student journalists from UC campuses 
on Tuesday, Sept. 30, to commemorate the first 
anniversary of her start date as president.

Student media representatives from across the 
nine undergraduate campus system, including 
UCSD Guardian reporters, attended the 
conference in Oakland, CA. UC Office of the 
President officials called the conference to allow 
Napolitano to answer questions about the current 
state of the UC System.

Napolitano spoke to reporters for over 40 
minutes and addressed a variety of their concerns. 
In regards to potential tuition increases, she said 
that during the November Regents’ meeting, they 

are going to have to look at a variety of options 
since state aid has decreased over the years. 

“The state is putting a little bit in but it’s by an 
eye dropper,” Napolitano said. “Realistically, at a 
certain point, we may have to look at tuition again; 
it’s just the arithmetic and the math.”

Napolitano and the Regents faced criticism 
in recent weeks for proposing an increase in 
chancellor salaries across the UCs. She addressed 
the issue by stating there is never a good time to 
increase salaries and that, if the UC is to remain a 
competitive institution, it is necessary to properly 
compensate the chancellors since many have taken 
salary cuts to come to the UC system.

“I think one of the good reasons for the 
timing is because [the Regents] were looking to

A recent study at UCSD found 
isotopic anomalies in sulfate 
molecules in Antarctic snow that 
has allowed scientists to examine 
Earth’s climate from billions of 
years ago prior to the accumulation 
of greenhouse gases.

Two separate natural occurrences 
— the El Nino Southern Oscillation 
and the eruption of the Pinatubo 
and Cerro Hudson volcanoes — led 
UCSD project scientist in chemistry 
Robina Shaheen to collect and study 
samples of the Antarctic snow over 
the last decade, which contained 
atmospheric deposits of sulfur that 
resulted from these two events.

The eruptions of Pinatubo and 
Cerro Hudson both occurred in 
1991 and caused a large amount 
of sulfate to shoot up into the 
stratosphere, far above our ozone 

layer. This sulfur-containing air 
mass then descended and settled 
on both the north and south poles. 
The sulfur can thus be found in the 
snow of the poles.

Sulfur occurs in four stable 
isotopes and behaves like a 
fingerprint for molecules. 

Each sulfur-containing molecule 
has its own unique isotopic 
signature. Occasionally, sulfur 
reactions divide differently from 
each other, which can cause the 
relative ratios of the isotopes to 
become anomalous.

“We observed huge signals in 
1998 from ENSO-driven changes, 
like extreme dry weather and 
ensuing biomass burning, which 
surprised me,” Shaheen said. 
“[However], I don’t think they’re 
related with each other [because] 
volcanic eruptions are caused by 
changes in pressure deep [within] 
the interior of the earth, [whereas] 
ENSO events are caused by changes 
in the sea’s surface temperature, 

which causes changes in wind 
patterns.”

Shaheen and her colleagues were 
able to collect and measure the 
direction and degree of the isotopic 
anomalies for individual layers of 
snow by studying each layer of ice 
with the highest possible resolution 
of sulfur between the years 1984 
and 2001. 

The team determined that the 
sulfur anomalies that occurred 
from the ENSO cyclical patterns 
and the volcanic eruptions resulted 
from photochemistry of sulfur 
compounds in the presence of  
ultraviolet light.

The ozone layer usually absorbs 
shortwave UV light radiation, 
which is impossible to see with the 
naked eye. 

However, because the protective 
ozone layer had not yet formed 
billions of years ago, the earth was 
bathed in shortwave UV light. 

The collected isotopic anomaly 
indicates a reaction with the UV 

light that has never occurred before 
and, according to Shaheen, is very 
important for interpreting Earth’s 
history.

Scientists also collected billion-
year-old rocks and analyzed the 
sulfate isotope signatures within 
them, and found that they formed in 
environments with minimal amounts 
of oxygen and high amounts of 
shortwave UV light as well. 

The current atmospheric 
reactions from ENSO and volcanic 
eruptions yielded a sulfur isotopic 
signal that closely matched those 
found in these ancient rocks.  

Shaheen later explained that due 
to the isotopic signature and simple 
mass balance,11 gigagrams (a 
gigagram is equal to 1,000,000,000 
grams) of sulfuric gas are currently 
entering the stratosphere from 
different types of anthropogenic 
activity, such as coal and petroleum.

wisely water, energy, land and our 
investments,” Gov. Brown said in the 
statement regarding the signed bills. 
“That’s why this is important.”

A bipartisan effort in the 
statehouse this summer yielded the 
California November election-ballot 
measure Proposition 1, which, if 
passed, would allow the state to raise 
$7.12 billion in new bonds to improve 

water infrastructure and purchase 
more water for local water agencies.

Meanwhile, efforts to accumulate 
data on water usage across the state 
that took place over the summer 
yielded responses from only 276 
of the 440 water agencies in the 
state, according to the Los Angeles 
Times. The San Diego County 
Water Authority formally refused 
the request to provide water -usage 
data, citing concerns for how the data 

would be used.
Compared to San Diego’s water 

usage in 2013, water usage between 
January and May of 2014 increased 
by 10 percent. However, the overall 
increase from 2013 to 2014 was 
much smaller. As annual rainfall 
decreases, agricultural companies 
must compensate as well.

AB 1014 provides for judicial 
discretion but specifies what 
kind of proof is required to deem 
somebody unfit for possessing a 
firearm. Substance and alcohol abuse 
evidence may be considered, but is not 
mandatory. Additionally, if someone 
under the age of 21 is found to be 
in  possession of alcohol through the 

investigation of a GVRO claim, they 
will be cited for underage drinking.

The law’s effect on UCSD affiliates, 
if any, is yet to be determined as 
existing campus laws ban most guns 
from campus. According to section 
22.16.10.33. of the UCSD Standards 
of Conduct, “possession, use or 
manufacture of a firearm or other 
dangerous weapons” is prohibited on 
campus unless an individual obtains 

written approval from the UCSD 
Chief of Police. Additionally, UC 
system policy prohibits possession of 
firearms and weapons. However, if 
there are circumstances in which the 
Chancellor, in collaboration with the 
campus police department, may deem 
it appropriate to possess a firearm.

approve the package for the new UC 
Irvine Chancellor,” said Napolitano. 
“[Chancellors] come, but they’re still 
way above where the chancellors are 
who have been with us a long time 
so then you get that kind of disparity 
there, so the notion is … we compete 
for the best all over the United States 
and we just got way off scale.”

Napolitano also addressed last 
year’s graduate student teaching 
assistant protests by saying she will 
look to invest funds in student faculty 
and student teaching assistant ratios. 

“I think that one of the reasons 

I would like some more funding 
for the academic missions on the 
campus is for exactly that sort of 
thing,” Napolitano said. “How do we 
improve the student faculty ratio, the 
TA number, class sizes there; that 
actually goes into time of graduation.” 

In regards to UCSD housing issues 
Napolitano told the Guardian that 
the issues will be resolved through 
individual UC capital plans.

“[UCSD] does undoubtedly have 
a capital plan and construction in 
vision and that would be handled 
under our executive vice president 
and with the chancellors,” Napolitano 

said. “That’s kind of on a campus-by-
campus basis.”

During her first year as UC 
President, Napolitano increased 
funding and aid for undocumented 
students and said Tuesday that she 
will continue working to improve the 
quality of those students’ experience 
at UC campuses. Part of her plan, 
she said, includes equalizing the 
college experience and financial 
resources for them, regardless of 
their immigration status.

Let’s Keep
the Crotch
Grabbing to
a Minimum

lauren  koa  lkoa@ucsd.edu
technically
 speaking

Iwould say that I’m a major supporter of social media campaigns, typically when 
they involve winning free swag, but 
especially when they raise awareness 
for a good cause. You can almost 
always count on me as the friend who 
will use your hashtags, like your page, 
join your event and repost your photo. 
But after watching a recent video of 
Hugh Jackman grabbing his crotch in 
slow motion to increase awareness for 
testicular cancer, I was left weirded 
out and stumped. Fifteen minutes 
passed before I reluctantly decided 
that I’d still support the campaign, 
so long as I don’t have to see an 
abundance of weird crotch-grabbing 
photos while it runs its course.

Now one of the latest Twitter 
trends, the “Feeling Nuts Challenge” 
hopes to encourage more men to 
self-examine themselves for testicular 
cancer, a disease that mostly affects 
young and middle-aged men. 
Similar to breast cancer for women, 
it’s recommended for men to 
self-examine monthly after hitting 
puberty. Though a rare disease, the 
American Cancer Society predicts 
that about 380 men will die of 
testicular cancer and 8,820 cases of 
testicular cancer will be diagnosed in 
2014 alone.

People are already predicting that 
the Feeling Nuts Challenge will be the 
next Ice Bucket Challenge because 
participants are encouraged to also 
challenge three friends to post their 
own photo, but this might just be a 
false sense of optimism. While its 
mission to increase awareness for 
testicular cancer is no less important 
than awareness for amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, the bolder concept of 
the #feelingnuts campaign may end 
up being its very downfall. Because 
of the more provocative nature of its 
campaign, I’m a little less convinced 
that it will draw the same viral 
response or level of participation. 
Celebrities will likely follow suit to 
support the campaign and people 
will still talk about them doing it, but 
most people will probably think twice 
before posting their own crotch-
grabbing photo online.

This summer, the success of the 
Ice Bucket Challenge was so popular 
on social media that you had to be 
living under a rock to avoid seeing 
videos of people dumping ice buckets 
on themselves for charity. Celebrities 
were doing it, sports teams were 
doing it and even several Instagram 
corgis did it too. The campaign saw 
a response of over 2.4 million videos 
posted online and over $100 million 
in donations. For a lot of people, 
myself included, the campaign was 
also responsible for the brand new 
knowledge that amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis is a disease that even exists.

Likewise, testicular cancer 
awareness is an important cause, so 
my hopes are high that the Feeling 
Nuts Campaign can and will make 
a difference. But, you can’t exactly 
hate me for hoping that my dad, 
uncles and cousins will decide to 
skip on this challenge and keep the 
crotch-grabbing private. And as a 
public service announcement to you 
all, if you’re going to post a photo of 
yourself grabbing your crotch, don’t 
forget to mention it’s for testicular 
cancer awareness; otherwise, people 
might mistake you as a douche or 
worse, a Nick Jonas wannabe.

At long last, universities will finally have the 
tools to stamp out rape culture. Sen. Kevin de Leon’s 
“Yes Means Yes” bill holds promise to improve the 
way colleges act to prevent and deal with sexual 
assault. Most importantly, the bill provides much-
needed clarification to the standards of consent. 

The bill reaches far and considers dozens of 
circumstances under a definitive interpretation 
of consent. The bill also further defines “lack 
of affirmative consent” in an impressively 
comprehensive list of situations where a victim 
may have been unconcious, intoxicated or 
otherwise unable to consent. Covering such an 
extensive set of cases will invalidate excuses 
by accused persons and rightfully places 
responsibility on assailants. 

Beyond this long-awaited guideline for what 
constitutes consent, SB 967  also mandates steps 
toward more “victim-centered” programs in a 
refreshing reversal of victim-blaming culture. 
The bill calls for “the development of a victim 
interview protocol,” which will hopefully foster 
a more sensitive and responsive environment 
for trauma victims. Other portions discuss more 
hands-on involvement of campus officials like 
training programs, referral systems and prevention 
and outreach programs — many programs that 
universities should already have in place but will 
hopefully be initiated now with the added pressure 
from the state. 

It’s been a long time coming, but this bill marks 
a major breakthrough. With California leading 
the way, the future looks bright for nationwide 
campaigns to make universities safer places and to 
redefine how our culture handles sexual violence 
and its aftermath.

Empty Bill Will Fall Short in 
Solving Sexual Assault Problem

New Bill Should Only Be the Begin-
ning of  More Educational Campaigns

“Yes Means Yes” Redefines Consent 
and Will Improve College Environment

According to the University of California 
system’s annual crime reports, cases of sexual 
assault have risen by nearly 50 percent from 
2012 to 2013. Gov. Jerry Brown has attempted 
to assuage this problem through the “Yes 
Means Yes” bill, but the legislation alone won’t 
solve the ubiquitous issue of sexual assault on 
college campuses. While the bill is a step in the 
right direction, there’s still a long way to go in 
preventing sexual assault.

The bill mandates certain protocols and some 
resources for dealing with sexual assault cases, 
but the legislation alone won’t change the culture 
of sex crimes on college campuses. In an Oct. 1 
CNN report, University of Washington sociology 
professor Pepper Schwartz explained that there 
should be more funding toward education about 
sexual assault and its causes because most sex 
crimes occur when students are intoxicated. This 
“Yes Means Yes” initiative will not be effective unless 
campuses are properly educated and make use of 
the resources this law mandates. 

UC president Janet Napolitano announced her 
advocacy of the bill and says she “will voluntarily 
establish an independent advocate to support 
sexual assault victims on every campus.” While 
her support is crucial, it’s more important to see 
actual change on our campuses. Campuses will be 
required to offer resources and establish protocol 
for sexual assault cases, but it is equally necessary 
that these resources will be easily accessible to 
students in order to prevent future sexual crimes. 
The “Yes Means Yes” law is important in increasing 
awareness, but more can always be done to support 
sexual assault victims and decrease offenses on 
college campuses. 

—  ROSINA GARCIA
Staff Writer

The recently signed “Yes Means Yes” bill for 
defining consent on California college campuses 
may be seen as a victory for sexual assault victims, 
but, in reality, the bill does little to help such 
victims at all. The law does not change how a 
university handles the aftermath of a sexual assault 
case or make any realistic attempt to prevent them. 
Instead of rewriting a definition, state legislators 
and campus administrators should work on 
instituting meaningful reforms that can actually 
prevent sex crimes and better support victims.

The language of the bill attempts to fine tune 
what is considered as consent, but the law will do 
little to change the motives, methods or mindsets 
of sexual predators and rapists on campus. The 
much bigger issue with sexual misconduct, assault 
and rape on campuses is how university systems 
actually investigate and handle such issues. In an 
era where 68 California colleges and universities 
are under investigation for allegedly violating Title 
IX through mishandling campus rape cases, it’s 
more than apparent that more needs to be done 
to help victims and improve prevention initiatives. 
Short of installing enforcement officers in students’ 
bedrooms, by only attempting to change the 
definition of consent, the new law won’t have any 
tangible effect on addressing the growing issue that 
is campus rape. 

Vetoing a bill like SB 967 could have proven 
disastrous for Gov. Brown in an election year. 
However, the real demonstration of Brown and 
the state legislature’s commitment to curb sexual 
assault on campuses will come when the state 
issues new laws that force our administrations 
to actually investigate, prosecute and prevent sex 
crimes on campus.

Four Year Degree Program Will Revitalize California Economy 

Life as a community college stu-
dent can be difficult. For the students 
who have academic ambition to pur-
sue further education, transferring to 
a four-year university is usually the 
main goal. But with our struggling 
economy and increased competition 
and overcrowding at both community 
colleges and state universities, this 
goal is often hard to attain. A recently 
signed bill in California will hopefully 
take some of the pressure off these 
students by providing a viable alterna-
tive: pursuing four-year Bachelor’s 
degrees offered at their own local 
community colleges. 

Last month, Governor Jerry 
Brown signed SB 850, which will 
allow up to 15 California com-
munity colleges to offer four-year 
baccalaureate degrees. The bill is 
aimed toward students who may 
want to increase their earning 
potential but either cannot afford 
a heftier tuition or commit to 
attending a traditional four-year 
university. 

The only caveat is that com-
munity colleges that are chosen 
to offer the programs will only be 
able to do so if the area of study is 
not offered at a nearby University 
of California or California State 
University campus, so as not to 
trivialize enrollment at UC or CSU 
schools. Programs will instead offer 

a variety of majors that are more 
appropriate for helping to remedy 
the lack of college graduates who 
are trained for more vocational 
and technical careers. The state 
hopes that the bill will help create 
an additional 1 million Bachelor’s 
degree jobholders by 2025 and fill a 
growing hole in California’s boom-
ing economy. 

The creation of the program is 
a much needed, welcomed remedy 
for some of the problems that have 
plagued California’s public higher 
education system in the past by 
improving both the affordability of 
and accessibility to four-year degrees. 
For students who did not have a 
strong academic record in high 
school, community colleges, which are 

less selective by nature, offering the 
program will represent a previously 
unavailable opportunity to better their 
future career prospects. 

And for students who are 
attending community colleges in 
hopes of transferring to a UC or 
a CSU, the bill effectively creates 
an alternative that will allow them 
to finish out a four-year degree 
without the undue interruption 
of switching schools and strug-
gling to get their footing in a more 
rigorous academic environment. 
Additionally, for students who 
might not be able to relocate from 
their homes to a town with a UC or 
a CSU, the programs will become

more accessible geographically. 
With the implementation of the 

four-year degree program at com-
munity colleges, affordability will 
also increase greatly. With the cur-
rent tuition of $12,192 per year at 
UCSD, the average student taking 
16 units of upper-division course-
work a quarter pays approximately 
$254 a unit and then miscellaneous 
university fees and textbook costs 
on top of that. Compare that to the 
current tuition per credit unit at 
community colleges, which hovers 
just under $50. 

The bill sets the cost per unit of 
upper-division coursework within 
the new four-year programs at $130 

a unit, which is close to 50 percent 
less expensive than UCSD. Factor 
in the costs of relocating, housing 
and transportation, and it will be 
decidedly more affordable for a 
student to attend the new four-year 
programs if they are interested in 
the offered majors. 

The program will also create a 
better, competitive alternative for 
students who might be interested in 
the vocational and technical train-
ing programs that are currently 
only offered, for the most part, by 
for-profit career schools with ques-
tionable motives. For those who are 
interested in pursuing career paths 
like dental hygiene and auto repair, 
for example, a four-year Bachelor’s 
program at a community col-

lege will be very attractive, if only 
because of the safeguard provided 
by being in a program funded and 
regulated by the state. 

The hope is that these degree 
programs can produce more college 
graduates who are more qualified than 
workers with high-school diplomas 
but not compete with their counter-
parts at traditional four-year universi-
ties like UCs and CSUs for higher 
paying jobs. Bachelor’s degrees will 
be more affordable, more accessible 
and will help revitalize the California 
economy as the state heads into a 
future that will demand a better-quali-
fied, skilled middle class.

After many reports of campus sexual assaults, on 
Sept. 19, President Obama declared the “It’s On Us” 
campaign that aims to end sexual assault on college 

campuses. The campaign advocates that instead of being a bystander to the problem, “it’s 
on us” to take an active role in becoming the solution. Students and staff members inter-
ested in taking a pledge to curb sexual assault can do so by visiting ItsOnUs.org.

One important step in standing against sexual assault is understanding the tools and 
resources available on campus. The Sexual Assault & Violence Prevention Resource Cen-
ter, located on the fifth floor of the Student Services Center in Room 555, offers numer-
ous resources for students to learn more about sexual assault and the protocols of report-

ing sexual assault whether you are the victim or a 
friend and to explore a myriad of reporting options, 
among other services.

“[SARC] provides education to all students,” 
Wahlig said. “We are the ones who accompany the 
victim of the crime to the police and follow up ex-
ams with the detective. We are also the ones who 
accompany the student to the hearing process if 
that is the way he or she wants the case to go. We 
also provide counseling and crisis intervention. We 
have comprehensive services here for our students.”

In accordance with the Clery Act, which man-
dates that universities publish an annual security 
report, UCSD’s 2014 Annual Security Report de-
tails sexual assault and harassment, domestic and 
dating violence and stalking policies. This report 
also reflects the updated definitions of consent as 
they appear in the “Yes Means Yes” bill. Students 
interested in reading about these policies, as well as 
sexual violence prevention and awareness programs 
available or required for students, staff and UCSD 
police, can visit police.ucsd.edu.

Wahlig notes that all UCSD police have received 
extensive training on sensitivity to victims of trau-
matic situations in response to a notable lack of 

such in the past.
“Before, police would ask a question of a victim of crime that would be insensitive,” 

Wahlig said. “They didn’t understand how distressed the victim could be.”
University of California mandates that even students who have been assaulted or af-

On Sept. 4, 2014, a woman was assaulted on La Jolla Village Drive, across from the Westfield Shoppingtown UTC. The victim 
reported that she was walking toward the pedestrian bridge on La Jolla Village Drive when 
the suspect attempted to drag her into nearby bushes. Bystanders witnessed the attack and 
chased the suspect away. 

This is not an uncommon occurrence across the nation, as forcible sexual assaults have 
been on the rise since 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Post-
secondary Education. Since sexual assault is clearly still a prevalent issue on and near our 
campus, as well as nationwide, lawmakers have worked in recent years to enact legislation 
to better protect victims and improve their resources.

Laws aimed at curbing sexual violence on campus 
first came into effect in 1990 when President George 
H. W. Bush signed the Clery Act. The Clery Act’s 
provisions enforced, for the first time, sexual crime 
awareness, victim rights and campus security, among 
other measures. On Sept. 28, 2014, Senate Bill No. 
967, dubbed the “Yes Means Yes” bill, was approved 
by California governor Jerry Brown. First proposed 
in February 2014 by California state Sens. Kevin de 
Leon and Hannah-Beth Jackson, the “Yes Means Yes” 
bill gained public support from University of Califor-
nia president Janet Napolitano in August.

“Every student deserves a learning environment 
that is safe and healthy,” de Leon, the Senate’s incom-
ing president pro tem, said in a statement on Sept. 
28. “The state of California will not allow schools to 
sweep rape cases under the rug. We’ve shifted the 
conversation regarding sexual assault to one of pre-
vention, justice and healing.”

Before last month’s “Yes Means Yes” legislation, 
there was an absence of explicit requirements for 
colleges and universities to administer services and 
support for victims of sexual assault. As a result, “Yes 
Means Yes” reinforces protection for such victims by 
requiring outreach and prevention programs against assault, dating violence and stalking 
as well as greater availability of services that can assist victims, such as counseling, victim 
advocacy and legal assistance. It also requires campuses to adopt a more uniform affirmative 
consent standard. “‘Affirmative consent’ means affirmative, conscious and voluntary agree-

Whereas the United Kingdom 
has made computer programming 
classes mandatory in primary and 
elementary schools, the United States 
still lags behind as many schools do 
not offer such courses. This is what 
inspired UCSD graduate students 
Stephen Foster, Lindsey Handley and 
Sarah Esper to create ThoughtSTEM, 
a start-up company that focuses on 
teaching kids how to code. Thought-
STEM has launched a Kickstarter 
campaign for its newest educational 
tool, “Codespells,” a game in which 
players create magical spells by creat-
ing their own codes.

From Sept. 2 to Oct. 3, the 
ThoughtSTEM team’s Kickstarter 
campaign drew the support of more 
than 5,000 backers and raised over 
$160,000 — over three times the orig-
inal goal.

With the extra funds, the team 
will try to introduce some more 

features to a desktop version of the 
game, which is scheduled to come 
out in September 2015. Handley esti-
mates that the game will cost around 
$25 to $30, though ThoughtSTEM is 
considering making the game avail-
able to schools for free. 

The game itself is similar to 
“Minecraft”, a popular virtual world 
game developed by Markus Persson 
in 2009. While “Minecraft” has two 
modes — a creative and a survival 
mode —  “Codespells” only has a cre-
ative mode that is essentially a sand-
box experience. In this open world, 
users can interact with the environ-
ment and play around with the dif-
ferent elements, including water, fire, 
air and earth. For instance, users can 
do things such as lift boulders, make 
waterfalls and change the weather. 
The team hopes to eventually imple-
ment a survival mode that will cater 
more to the entertainment side of the 
game and allow multiplayer duels and 
mini-games. 

Players create their spells through 

a drag and drop coding language 
called Blockly, which is similar to the 
Scratch computer program that some 
elementary schools use to teach their 
students. The point of Blockly is to al-
low even children who are still unable 
to type to understand the logic and 
key concepts behind programming. 
There is also another option that al-
lows users to code in Javascript, as 
well.

The idea for “Codespells” came 
from Foster’s experiences as a com-
puter science major at Southwestern 
University. Foster, the project lead 
for “Codespells” created an early 
prototype of the game called “Open 
Metagame.” He came to UCSD to 
pursue a Master’s degree in comput-
er science but was also interested in 
teaching youth about computer pro-
gramming. Handley, a Biochemistry 
Ph.D. student at UCSD, and Esper, a 
recent computer science Ph.D. gradu-
ate, came together to found Thought-
STEM in 2012.

“Young kids think of coding as 

something that is really, really dif-
ficult,” Handley said. “And we want 
kids to realize that coding is some-
thing that you can do and is really 
fun and really creative. We wanted to 
raise awareness among kids to realize 
that this is a really cool avenue to pur-
sue in the future.”

In the past two years, Thought-
STEM has branched out from pro-
viding after-school programs and 
summer camps to creating games like 
“Codespells.” Planning for the game 
started in 2011, and a working pro-
totype was ready in 2012. Thought-
STEM tested its game at Spreckles El-
ementary in San Diego. Currently, the 
team is working on making the game 
more appealing and fun for kids.

Handley, who heads business and 
marketing for the project, remembers 
that the children at Spreckles who 
tested “Codespells” were fascinated 
by the game. In fact, San Diego’s pub-
lic radio and TV program KPBS even 
featured “Codespells” in a special epi-
sode in 2013.

“The kids were smiling, laughing 
and working together on these pro-
ects,” Handley said. “The kids really 
took to the projects well, and when 
[Esper] was running these studies, 
they would ask the teacher, ‘When 
is [Esper] coming back? We want to 
play Codespells!’”

Handley notes the importance of 
an early computer science education 
that ThoughtSTEM promotes, as she 
herself regrets that she did not learn 
to code until she came to graduate 
school at UCSD.

“I found that [coding] was a really 
useful ability that could have saved 
me a lot of time,” Handley said. “I’m a 
biochemist by training and analyzing 
my data by coding programs has been 
a huge timesaver and has changed the 
way I do science sometimes. If people 
realized that they have this capabil-
ity, it could make the world a better 
place.”

ment to engage in sexual activity,” the 
text of the bill reads.

When regarding affirmative con-
sent standards, the “Yes Means Yes” 
bill states that the “lack of protest 
or resistance,” silence, the pre-exis-
tence of any sort of relationship, in-
capacitation due to drugs or alcohol 
or unconsciousness are all invalid 
excuses for affirmative consent to 
sexual activity. The bill also states 
that consent can be revoked at any 
time and that intoxication, reckless-
ness or assumption of consent with-

out proper investigation on the per-
petrator’s part are not valid excuses 
for failure to attain consent.

Students interested in reading the 
bill in its entirety can visit leginfo.leg-
islature.ca.gov.

Consequently, updated UCSD 
sexual assault policy includes the 
same provisions as does the “Yes 
Means Yes” legislation, according 
to Nancy Wahlig, director of 
UCSD’s Sexual Assault and Violence 
Prevention Center.

fected at a location off campus will be 
helped.

“If an individual reports to the 
university that the individual has 
been a victim of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault or 
stalking, s/he shall be provided 
with a written explanation of the 
individual’s rights and options 
whether the offense occurred on- 
or off-campus or on any university 
location,” the University of 
California Sexual Harassment and 
Sexual Violence Policy states.

In any case that a UCSD student 
has been sexually assaulted, there 
are numerous options that students 
can pursue when reporting the in-
cident with the assistance of SARC: 
criminal, civil, administrative or 
non-reporting.

If a victim chooses to report the 

crime, calling 911 would deliver the 
quickest response. They can also 
choose to report at a later time, and 
can do so anonymously by calling 
the UCSD Police Department at 
858-534-4357.

For civil reporting, victims have 
two options: filing a civil suit, which 
allows the victim the opportunity 
to recover damages whether or not 
criminal charges have been filed, or 
obtaining a protective/restraining 
order. If a victim chooses to report to 
UCSD Campus Administration, the 
Office for the Prevention of Harass-
ment and Discrimination will inter-
vene to determine whether or not 
a UCSD policy has been breached.  
Those interested can learn more 
about administrative procedures by 
contacting OPHD at 858-534-8298. 
Student victims can also choose to 
record administrative complaints by 
contacting Office of Student Con-

duct at 858-534-6225.
Lastly, victims can choose to 

pursue the non-reporting option, 
in which he or she can receive emo-
tional support and individual and 
group counseling through SARC, 
Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices or the Faculty Staff Assistance 
Program. The victim also has the op-
tion to have a non-investigative re-
port filed by taking a Sexual Assault 
Forensic Exam, commonly known 
as a “rape exam,” without filing a 
police report. SARC will help those 
interested through this process.

For UCSD registered students 
who have been affected by sexual as-
sault, relationship violence or stalk-
ing, SARC offers free and confiden-
tial services. SARC is open Monday 
to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
and is on call 24 hours a day.

spark plugs, new battery, and it comes with

backyard. Has racing mods to make the jet 
ski go to 65mph. It almost turns over, but 
it won’t catch, it looks like the wrong air to 
gas ratio and it probably just needs a tune-

Bernardino’s middles tonight,” 
Luyties said. “They were doing any-
thing they wanted to against our 
defense.” 

Although the match turned 
out to be close, the numbers show 
that the Tritons were struggling all 
night, hitting the second-lowest 
attack percentage of the season with 
a subpar 0.094 (49–33–170). It was 
also only the second time that they 
hit less than 0.100 this season. 

While UCSD struggled to 
find consistency, Cal State San 

Bernardino was able to find its 
offensive groove as it finished the 
night hitting 0.265 (60–20–151). 
The Coyotes also managed to hold 
the advantage in blocks (13.5 to 9) 
and digs (72 to 65).

Among the Tritons who played 
that night, Dahle led with 17 kills 
in an inefficient 0.090 (17–11–67). 
Brenton came out with a double-
double, posting 11 kills and 11 digs. 
Freshman outside hitter Amanda 
Colla rose to the occasion with a 
team-best 14 digs, while juniors set-
ter Heidi Sierks and middle blocker 
Kameron Cooper tied for six blocks.

The Tritons finally return to 
RIMAC Arena after four consecutive 
road matches for a two-game home-
stand against Cal State Monterey Bay 
on Oct. 10 and Cal State East Bay on 
Oct. 11. The match against Cal State 
Monterey Bay is the annual Reis Cup, 
named in remembrance for the tragic 
death of former Triton Karen Reis in 
2012. The following day, the match 
against Cal State East Bay will feature 
the unveiling of the UCSD Athletics 
Hall of Fame Class of 2014 banners.

Water Polo Will Head Next to UCLA for SoCal Tournament

tage in the first quarter. 
The Tritons continued to add 

to their point tally throughout the 
match, finishing with a grand total 
of 17 scores to the Air Force’s seven. 

UCSD senior utility Josh Stiling 
had a game-high of four goals, while 
Cockerill had a hat trick himself. 

Ravanach gave another impressive 
performance at the defensive end, 
tying a season high 15 saves.

“All in all, a classic team effort, 
and Cameron was excellent in the 
goal,” Harper told the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “We knew this would be 
a real test, coming off of Wednesday’s 
win over LMU and playing on the 
same day as traveling.”

With the two wins, UCSD 
remains at the top of the Western 
Water Polo Association standings 
with a perfect 3–0 record. The 
Tritons travel next to UCLA on Oct. 
11 for the SoCal Invitational, hoping 
to improve to a winning record.

Get Hyped:
The Triton 
Season Is
Upon Us

Full Court Press

While thousands of UCSD stu-
dents have only just begun attending 
(or skipping) their courses for the 
new school year, Triton athletes have 
already been hard at work for months. 
With Triton sports seasons in full 
throttle, there is quite a bit to be excit-
ed about. Contrary to the misconcep-
tion that UCSD athletics have little to 
root for, this year, like any other year, 
has me ready to cheer on the blue and 
gold. While I am obviously pumped 
for the teams themselves, here are five 
other awesome things, in no particu-
lar order, that have me ready for the 
new sports year. 

#1 Jordyn McNutt: The San Diego 
native and midfielder of the women’s 
soccer team has already recorded 11 
points (three goals, five assists) in just 
eight games. McNutt is far and away 
the scoring leader and offensive core 
of the Tritons — but the real kicker, 
pun intended, is that she is only a 
freshman. The eight games in which 
McNutt has shredded up the field are 
the only eight games of her entire col-
legiate career thus far. To say the least, 
the future is bright for her and for the 
UCSD women’s soccer squad

#2 New Triton Ballpark: This 
spring, the men’s baseball team will 
trot onto the field of a brand-new 
Triton Ballpark. Everything is being 
redone, from the dugouts to the press 
box—they are even building an area 
for food trucks. And of course, the 
team itself has an incredibly talented 
lineup primed to leave a legacy on a 
new field. With this state-of-the-art 
ballpark on its way, the coming season 
will be unforgettable. 

#3 NCAAs water polo: This 
December,  Canyonview Pool will 
host the 2014 NCAA men’s water polo 
championship for the third time in 
UCSD history. The No. 8 Tritons, who 
are projected to win their conference 
and earn their ticket to nationals, will 
have a tough time in the tournament 
if they qualify. Regardless, the event 
should be a sight to see, as the very 
best teams in the nation will battle for 
the national crown in UCSD waters. 
The Tritons will have their eyes set on 
a strong NCAAs showing in front of a 
sellout home crowd. 

 #4 Spirit Night: Last year’s Spirit 
Night was insane. With only 0.4 
seconds remaining in the women’s 
basketball game, senior guard Megan 
Perry caught an inbound pass and 
tossed up a buzzer-beating shot to 
send the game into overtime. In the 
men’s game, freshman forward Adam 
Klie soared for a high-flying alley-oop 
in UCSD’s blowout win. And these 
moments, among many other great 
ones, occurred in front of RIMAC 
Arena’s second largest crowd ever. 
This year, I expect Spirit Night to be 
even bigger and better. 

#5 Women’s basketball vs. 
Stanford: In the Tritons’ first game 
of the year, UCSD will travel to 
play Stanford in a Nov. 8 exhibi-
tion match. Aside from this being 
a great matchup of schools, the real 
excitement is in the face-off on the 
sidelines. UCSD’s head coach Heidi 
VanDerveer will bring her Tritons 
to Stanford to play her older sister, 
longtime Cardinal head coach, 
Tara VanDerveer. With a dominant 
Cardinal squad, Tara may have the 
upper hand in this sibling rivalry, 
but Heidi’s Tritons will surely put up 
a fierce fight.

Tritons Perfect in WWPA Play
The No. 8 Tritons recorded two impressive victories over No. 17 LMU 
and No. 15 Air Force to bring them up to 6–6 overall on the season.

WOMEN'S  VOLLEYBALL

UCSD Splits Pair of  Road Games, Sits Third in CCAA
Volleyball comes from behind against Humboldt State, falls in tough five-set loss to Cal State San Bernardino. 

The No. 8 UCSD men’s water polo team recorded two impressive wins with a 7–2 victory over No. 17 Loyola Marymount 
University at a sold-out Canyonview Aquatics 
Center on Wednesday, followed by a 17–7 routing 
of No. 15 Air Force on the road on Friday. The 
pair of wins puts UCSD on a three-game winning 
streak to even out its record at 6–6.

The Tritons struggled offensively against 
LMU early on, converting only one goal in the 
first half. LMU struck first at four minutes in the 
first quarter with a goal from sophomore Matt 
Cuozzo. UCSD was granted a penalty shot in the 
following possession but was unable to capital-
ize as the goalkeeper narrowly corralled the ball 
before it passed the goal line.

Despite the missed opportunities, the Tritons 
were able to tie the game right before the end of 
the quarter, as senior 2M Matt Michalko scored 
the equalizer with 27 seconds left in the first half. 

The Lions continued their physical play on 
defense and scored once more to close out the 
first half at a 2–1 score. 

“I don’t think we shot particularly well [in the 
first half], and overall it’s a good lesson for our 
guys,” UCSD head coach Denny Harper said. “We 
had a lot of counterattack opportunities, [but] we 
just weren’t converting, so we addressed that.” 

Towards the end of the third quarter, the 
Tritons finally broke loose, scoring six unan-
swered goals to take the runaway with the win. 
Senior utility David Higginson finished with a 
hat trick, with all three of his goals coming in the 
final quarter. 

“[We] made a few adjustments and I think that 
was the key,” Harper said. “We got our counterat-
tacks going. Obviously, we got the crowd into it.” 

The Tritons seized that momentum and, with 
the help of their home pool advantage, blew the 
game out of the water in front of 1,704 fans. 

“They were loud all game,” junior utility 
Chase Cockerill said. “It’s so easy to play in this 
environment. Everyone comes out, and as loud as 
they were, it was just fantastic.”  

UCSD senior goalkeeper Cameron Ravanbach 
played a crucial role in the Tritons’ victory, mak-
ing 13 saves and shutting the Lions out for the 
entire second half. 

“Cameron is the best goalie in our confer-
ence by far and away,” Cockerill said. “When you 
have that presence in the game, you can kind of 
do whatever you want defensively. It allows us 
to have more faith in the outside shot, counter 
harder and run a bit of a zone.” 

On Friday, the Tritons traveled to Colorado 
to take on No. 15 Air Force. Unlike Wednesday 
night, UCSD wasted no time in getting its offense 
up and running, building up a quick 5–1 advan-

This past week, the UCSD wom-
en’s volleyball team split a pair of 
matches, with a comeback 3–2 vic-
tory over Humboldt State and a 
hard-fought 3–2 loss against No. 
8 Cal State San Bernardino. The 
Tritons are now 8–5 overall and 6–3 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

The Tritons extended their per-
fect record against Humboldt State 
Thursday, Oct. 2 to 20–0, winning 
three straight sets after falling in the 
first two, pulling off the comeback 
victory in a dominating fashion.

The Tritons struggled early on, 
hitting only 0.182 in the opening set 
and a measly 0.162 in the second. 

“[In] the first two sets we were a 
step slow but still competed hard, so 
I knew we could win some games,” 

UCSD head coach Ricci Luyties told 
the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“We came out in the third and cut 
down on the errors, were more alert 
on defense and blocked well.” 

The third set marked a turning 
point for UCSD, as the team was  able 
to dramatically improve its hitting to 
0.317 in the third and 0.500 in the 
fourth and fifth to finish the game 
with a season-best 0.311 attack per-
centage despite the early woes. 

Leading the charge was senior 
opposite hitter Caitlin Brenton, who 
racked up 20 kills, closely followed 
by junior outside hitter standout 
Danielle Dahle, who converted on 
18 kills.

In a nail-biting back-and-
forth match at No. 8 Cal State San 
Bernardino, the Tritons ultimately 
exited with a bitter 3–2 loss this 
past Saturday night. The match was 
tightly contested throughout, going 

to five sets with scores of 25–23, 
22–25, 25–12, 17–25 and 15–6. 

The opening two sets were also 
close, until the final three sets, 
which were essentially one-sided 
affairs. Despite an easy victory 
in the fourth set, the Tritons fell 

behind early in the fifth and final set 
and ultimately failed to contain the 
Coyotes’ outburst.
