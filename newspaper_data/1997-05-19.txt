MONEY: Diallo and Fiori's 
budget also propo e giving 
enator ' pay to executive 

By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Slaff Writer 

As another school year draws to a close. the 
n w A.S. ouncil i ' faced with the sizable task 
of deciding how to allocate ne t year's 
$675,000 budget. 

The A.S. ouncil Finance ommillee met 
Thursday to review the executive budget pro-
posed by President Sou ley Diallo and Vice 
President Finance Tony Fiori . I 

The commillee will make it s recommenda-
tion on the propo ed budget to the entire A. . 

ouncil. which must either ratify or alllend it. 
At its meeting last Thursday. the commillee 

approved 34 of 36 budget items. After meeting 
for about six hours, committee members decid-
ed to reconvene Monday at 6:30 p.m. tu vote on 
the two remaining items - stipend allocations 
and member fees for the Univer~ity of 
California Student Association. 

Oiallo and Fiori have proposed eliminating 
senator stipends and using the money to boost 
executives' pay. The proposed budget docs nol 
include membership fees in the U.S. Siudent 
Association , but new A. . Vice President 
External Arzo Mansury is expected to lobby for 
their inclusion in the linal budget. 

"We have a presentation ready for Itoday '!. l 
meeting." said Man ·ury. "[ just want to make 
sure that Ihe council knows why USSA is 0 
important." 

The finance com millee approved a 20-per-
cent increase in programming funding and a 
15-percent increase in studen t-organi/.atlon 
funding . 

Oiallo said he wanted 10 increa 'e the pro-
gram ming and Mudent-organil.alion hudgets 
because he believes these services alfect Ihe 
largest number of students. 

"There lareltwo areas In Ihe budget where I 
fundamentally helieve student:, receive the 
most impact from their money," Olallo said . 
"One is programming and the other one IS stu-
dent organil.ati ons." 

Oiallo said Ihe 33.02lJ increase in the pro-
gramming budget appears to be more dramatic 
than it aClually IS. 

"One of the things we talked ahout during 
Ihe campaign. for exa mple. IS that we wanted to

Bursar Will Replace Old Photo IDs This 
Fall With New 'Triton Plus' Smart Cards 
TECHNOLOGY: 
Fisher hopes to link 
parking to new card 
By Eric Brace 
Sta(( Writer 

The Bursar's Oflice is preparing 
to meet the march or technology 
head-on this fall wi th a new student 
ID card that wi ll inc.:lude several 
enhanced features in addition to the 
standard meal plan and Plus 
account access. 

Future student s may also be 
able to replace their curren t tele-
phone and photocopy cards wi lh 
the Triton Plus card. and UCSD 

Bur~a r Howa rd Fisher s,lId he 
hopes siudents will he ahle to use 
the card for parking purposes once 
the lechno logy hecomes avai lahle . 

Fisher 'aid readers in campus 
rarklng lots would deduct the cost 
of parki ng from the ~tudent s' 
accoun ts. 

"This would help those ~tudents 
who on ly come to t:ampus a few 
days a week or for onl y a limited 

time," Fisher said. 
Fisher added that he and his co l-

leagues seriously considered stu -
dents' daily live when developing 
the card . 

"The team was very student -ori-
ented," Fisher said. " We have 
looked to benefit the students and 
not to place outside interests above 
them." 

T he Triton Plus card is based 
on the Integra ted Student 
Informati on Systcm (IS IS). a 
ca mpu database thut coordinates 
Offices of Admissions and 
Registrar, Housing, Parkin g. 
Bur ar and Student Financia l 
Services records. 

According to the repan. Triton 
Plus would gradually reduce - or 
ideally eliminate - Ihe myriad of 
registrati on. bu . meal plan. Plu~ 
Card and other sti ckers lIsed on the 
present IDs. 

"To the greatest extent pos,ihle. 
the campus card shou ld he 'sticker-
less,'" the repon states . "Card vcn-
dors have been asked to present 
proposals to UCSD ... I includingi 

the use of co lored bars. hack-
ground. grid, etc." 

Fisher 'aid future Tri ton Plus 
goals int:lude eli minating the use of 
l egistration sti ckers or identitica-
tion numbers through card readers 
at RIMAe. the Student Hea lth 

ervice. the Career Services Center 
and other offi ces requil ing access 
to student records. 

Fisher added that any services 
provided on the card would pay for 
themselves. 

"The card is self- ustaining," he 
said. "Rates and fees should not be 
used to generate surplus revenues 
for uses elscwhere on tht: campus, 
bu t rather any rates or revenues 
should only ensure the campus-
ca rd system is ,clf-supporting." 

The operators of any ncw Triton 
Plus service, wou ld be required to 
pay all necessary startu p cosb.

OPINION 
COMMENTARY: Engineers at IBM managed to develop a machine that outwitted the greatest player in the 

history of chess, but the fact remains that humans will always be able to do things that computers cannot 

GARRY KASPAROV LOST A CHESS MATCH TO A 
SUPERCOMPUTER: So WHAT? 

By Ry .... Olson 
Staff Writer 

Eight days ago, the ches, world 
reeled with the new~ that intema-
tional champion Garry Kasparov 
had lost hi~ mat~h agai nst I BM '~ 
supercomputer, Deep Blue. 
ReSigning atter only 19 move~, 
Ka~parov left the hoard visihly dl~­
tressed, wavmg his arms at hiS assi~­
tants. 

Newspapers and television ~ta­
tions worldwide called Deep Blue'~ 
victory the delillltive tnumph ot 
madllne ovcr man. 

The chess match, whose I. I 
million purse was underwritten hy 
IBM, was actually a rematch. Thc 
trusty pair of chess fiends lirst faced 
each other last year, with Ka, parov 

soundly defeating Deep Blue in 
five games. There wa~ one 
major difference between the 
two matches: Deep Blue was 
upgraded during the interim 
- Garry Kasparov was 

not. 
Kasparov - ~ome-
tlme~ called "thc 

Mi~hael Jordan of 
ches~" - has been a 
horrihly sore loser 
since last week 's 

Joe Ang,ulo/ Guarown a s ton ish i n g 

defeat. He accused the IBM team of 
programming the computer speci fi -
cally to heat him. He also com-
plained that he really didn 't feel like 
playmg, and thu, was an easy target 
lor any opponl.!nt - not just Dl:ep 
Blue. 

Quite honestl y, if a computer 
kicked my tarkw" I'd prohahly react 
the same way. However, to hl ame 
the computer lilr such a poor show-
IIlg wasn ' t the hCM way lor 

Ka~parov til ~avc face. 
HI ~ rea<:llon IS one that I~ totally 

human. It I ~ !>()methmg we ~h()uld 
undeNanei . Computer, elo not have 
an ego, an Id or a ~uperego. Instead 
of controlling their own desuny, 
computers' "thoughls" arc di ctated 
hy programmer~ and u ~ers. 
Kasparov, like everyone else. shou ld 
rea li ze there IS no shame in belllg 
defeated by a maehin~ that wa~ [1m-
grammed hy other human bcing~ . 
Besides, how many 01 u, arc 
ashamed that computers can do 
hasic arithmetic much faster than we 
can? 

Computers arc merely t(Xlb. -
terrilically powerful toob, hut tool, 
nonetheless. Many of us u,e the 
computer more than any other type 
of machine. At the offi ce, people 
mock me for using the computer for 

everything - from writing a paper 
to searching the Internet for how 
many licks it takes to get to the cen-
ter of a Tootsie Roll pop. (By the 
way, it takes three licks.) 

However. people who talk about 
how much more intelligent comput-
er arc than human, arc making a 
fundament al mistake. One member 
of the Dee[1 Blue team of program-
mers said. "We on the IBM Deep 
Blue team are Indeed vcry proud that 
wc 've played a rolc in IhlS historic 
event." 

Walt a minut e. an Illstorical 
even!') What was ,0 Iw.torical ahout 
thl' event '! To ~ay that computer'. arc 
now ~uperior to people I, ,Imrl> 
lucl lcrou.,. A comruter can casil} 
beat me in chl.:s.,. even when the [1m-
gram I., set in ultra-beginner mode. 
Doc, that mean that the computer IS 
better at lile than I am? Of cou r~e not 
- It Ju,t l11~an~ that It has been rm-
grammed to execute all the move~ 
and rule~ 01 ch..:s~ fla wb,sly, ~omc­
thing I ca ll never hope to do. 

Deep Blue\ greatest advantage 
was that It wa~ rrogramm..:d to recall 
a lmo~t In,tantly any posslhk move 
I rom any pOSition on the board. It 
abo had the knowledge of several 
che~s grandmasters in it~ data banks.

UNIONS HELP BALANCE COMPETING INTERESTS 
Editor: 

Natu re i~ a halance of conlliulIlg 
interc ts. One such confli ·t solved h) 
nature is the balance hctween individ-
ual nghts and the general we lfare. 
Hi~tory has convilll.: ingly demon,trat -
ed that colk:ction, of individual, arc 
an ama/ingly elkctl ve solution to this 
trade-oil' pmblem. 

In the specilic in,t<1m;e of worker 
rights vs. husiness welfare. unions 
have demonstr,lIcd many time, their 
erlic iency in protecting worker ri ghts. 
How? First. busines~ welfare. while it 
Illay Include worker rights, is often at 
odd. with these righl~ . Busi nesses 
want to use workers to make l11oney. 

Second. and more importantly, a 
hu~incss is by delinition a w llcction. 
As SUch. a business can utili!.e a pool 
or re~()urces toward a common goal. 
On the other hand. a worker is hy def-
inition an individual. To effectively 
make individual needs known to a 
husiness, a collection of workers IS 
necessary. 

Rece ntly, we have experienced 
this conflict in the form fTA rights 
vs. university welfare. Arc unions an 
effective solution to the trade-olT 
problem in this instance" The answer 
to this question is not quite as simple 
as in the I.:ase of the preceding para-
graph. 

TIle reason our panlcular situation 
IS 0 comrie ' is that the husiness we 
arc involved in is cducation. TIle uni -
versi ty udmlllistration, In deciding the

quality of education and TA right,. 
Thai I" the uni versity must balance 
lhesc th ree confl icting goals in any 
decision it makes. 

If the university endanger, its 
monetary well-being. who suITcr;,! 
MOM likely the administrJtors will

The committee also approved a

Fiori sa id t hat last year, the 
council a llocaled money for alter-
native papers - suc h as Tire Koala 
- in a lump su m at the beginning 
of Ihl.! school year, H owever, a lot 
of thi s muney wen t unused. 

" I n the past , media has been

Ithe Commi tt ee for World

said. "We ' re going to move 10 a

if they're no t u sing Ihe m o ney i l

BAN: UCSD 
officials favor 
granting favors 
Continued from paCe 3 
that the propo al would retum in 
the fall after the Academic Senate 
had a chance to review it. 

The University of Cali fomi a has 
been grappling with the issue of 
how to answer donors who request 
admissions favors since la t year, 
when the long-standing practice 
first came to light. 

Although a review by Provost 
Judson King showed that fewer 
than 12 freshmen per year receive 
any sort of special treatment 
because of VIP connections. 
Connerly - who led the charge 
agai nst affirmative action - 'aid 
that even one case is too many. 

"Philosophically, the University 
of California shouldn ' t be admit-
ting anyone based on who they 
know or how much money they 
have," he said. 

Bravin added that the practice 
of tyi ng admissions to donation, 
even in a just a few instances. 
"rea lly .cheapens the intentions of 
all our donors." 

Last year 's uproar led the board 
to pass a lukewann resolution that 
prohibited regents and other elect-
ed officials from attempting to 
"influence inappropriately" admis-

~ions decisions. as well as a similar 
state Senate resolution that urged 
the regents to eliminate favoriti sm 
from the admissions process. 

Richard Backer, UCSD assis-
tant vicc chancellor for enrollment 
management/registrar said that hi s-
torica ll y, UCSD hasn't had to deal 
with VI Ps seeking admiss ions pref-
erence. 

"When IAtkinsonl was on thi ~ 
campu ~, he wouldn' t tolerate it. "

Parking 
Blues 

-

Parking at UCSD - I'm nOI 
~ur~ such a phenomenon truly 
eXIMs. I can directly attribute a 
large portion of the fru slrati on and 
anxiety Ihat I ~xperience on a daily 
bam to my attempls at parkmg Illy 
ca r In whal Iran~po rt ation scn' ic~s 
cidilm i~ still "on" campus (de~plle 
the fact thai ,in entire shuttle s) , -
tem I, firmly in place to IranSpOI'l 
~ tudt:nl, 10 and from ~uch relllllle 
Im:auol1s). Go ligurc. Thi~ is clear-
ly a ca e or nothing less than purc. 
sweet parking 101 hell. 

During the three years I Iw\c 
been a sludenl al thi~ acadellllC 
institution, the parking si lualion 
hu, ,erved as a source of con~tant 
and unnecessary stress. not to men-
tion temporary insanity. 

The horror hegins to take shape 
as hundreds of dollars are handed 
over to obtain a mandatory parking 
permit, which guarantees ... well , to 
be completely honest. absolutely 
nothing. 

Then the occasion arises when I 
decide I would like to attend one of 
my lectures. I end up conning 
myself into believing Ihat if I leave 
a good 45 minutes to an hour 
before my class is scheduled to 
begin. , miglll be rewarded for my 
moti vation with a parking spot -
which is almost as far away from 
campus as my off-campus apart-
ment. Of course, th is is merely a 
ligment of my imagination. 

The reality of parking lot pur-
gatory can be appropriately equat -
ed with the mad-capped slapstick 
round in scenes of ';Nalional 
Lampoon's European Vacation." 
Clark W. Griswold verges on 
delirium as he signals to change 
lanes, but just "can ' t get left." His 
fami ly must witness hi s mental 
stability lapse, as he is instead 
forced to dri ve around and around 
the same turnabout , maniaca lly 
exclaiming, "Look kids, Big Ben , 
Parliament I" 

Much of the same pathos comes 
into play each and every time I 
come to campus. , just can't get a 
damn space! I drive up and down 
one row, and then up and down 
another and then another. , occa-
sionally fall victim to those cars 
that pull up just far enough for-
ward so that it looks like an avail-
able space when, of course, there is 
no such luck. At this point, my san-
ity is about to be pushed over-
board. , find myself ready to shout 
"Look kids, medical center, Triton 
field!" 

I begin plotting the demise of 
any prospective parking opportuni-
tics that my fellow tudents may 
have in mind. It is c learly no longer 
a politc game. Instead. finding 
somewhere - anywhere - to park 
has become my mission. The sim-
ple task of parking one's car has 
been elevated to the complexity of 
national -security issues. 

On top of this realization. I also 
delightfully di scover that I am 
already more than 15 minutes late 
to my clas .

Passion for 
lssues, respect 
for fellow 
UCSD 
students and 
dedication to 
the campus first 
drove Marshall 
senior Coleen 
Sabatini to run 
for the 1996-
1997 A.S. 
Presidency. 
Upon 
graduation, 
Sabatini hopes 

. 

to conttnue 
her efforts on

communtty. 

ELL DONE 

"My problem is ' al11 passion-
ate about too many issues," 
UCSD's 1996- 1997 A.S. 
President oleen Sabatini said. 
"I am kind of like a freak. I'm 
out of state , science-oriented -
not usually what you ec in A.S." 
Passing the Torch 

After passing her title on to 
Sou ley Diallo during fifth week, 
Sabatini had more time to pursue 
her numerous olher inlNC ts and 
enjoy a lillie time off. However, 
Sabatini says her schedule is as 
hectic as ever; the past two 
weeks have not given her much 
time to reflect. 

'" am still in that 
recoveryllransilion period so I 
haven ' t necessari ly had as much 
time to reflect on this past year 
as I'd like to," Sabatini said . "I 
could probably answer that ques-
tion beller in two months." 

Sabatini says she is trying to 
break her habit of relegating her 
time and energy, as she has done 
all year. 

" It' hard for me right now in 
general to pass things on." she 
said . "J'm not in the habit of 
leaving things unfinished. I do 
genuinely care about UCSD and 
the student here, so it's hard for 
me to walk away when I 'ee 

Ihings that need to be done." 
Not Your Regular 9 • 5 

It is that respe~ and affection 
for her fellow students that ha ' 
guided Sabatini through the ups 
and downs of the past year. 

" 't really meant a lot to me 
that people approached me all ut. 
running and wanted me to be 
Ihelr representative," she said . "I 
decided to run because I thought 
my experience. commitmenl and 
dedication could be effective in 
the position of AS. president. 

"But, when it got a lillie over-
whelming at times, I would kind 
of sit down and remind myself of 
the students, specifica lly the 
ones that rcally inspired you to 
run . You ' re here for a year, and 
you h a~e to put as much into it 
as you possibly can in that one 
year time, and fight the good 
light." 

However. the duties of her 
office demanded almost of all of 
Sabatini 's time and energy. 

'" dedicated a tremendous 
amount of time to A.S. over the 
past year, working 40-50 hours 
up in AS. and al the same time 
being a full -time student," 
Sabatini said. "On the personal 
side of things , , definitely sacri-
ficed my personal time, my 

Zakl Rubenstein/Guardian 

social time with my fri ends and I 
guess Ihat since thi s is my last 
year, I have some regrets about 
that , but , wanted to. do a good 
job as president, so I put every-
thing I had into the posilion. 

"A.S. became my number 
one pri rity, academics a close 
second, and everything else kind 
of took the back seat for the rest 
of the year - and personally. , 
don' t think that was a healthy 
prioritization. I'd sleep on four 
hours a night to get all this stuff 
done. but' was able to maintain 
my sanity." 

Sabatini's personable leader-
ship . tyle allowed her to keep 
both her personal and collective 
A.S. goals in focu . One or her 
definitive priorities was in mak-
ing "'.S. avai lable to everyone, 
in the attempt to address all stu-
dents' needs and concerns. 

"I came from more the grass 
root ac ti vism side of things. and 
I think that we really tried to 
make A.S. a more welcoming 
environment, profe sional, but 
not bureaucratic," Sabatini said. 
" It was very open and friendly, 
yet eflicient and I think that Ihat 
is a balance that needs to be 
made - people need to be able

At the Women's Center: Former A.S. President Coleen Sabatini (cente r) discusses issues with Women's 
Center director Nancy Loevinger (left ) and staff member Patty Chol (right ). 

SABATINI: 
Being a woman 
leader was not easy 
Continued from page 13 
10 co m..: III and feci thai they are 
welcome. 

"IA.S.I is really striving to find 
Ihat halancc. and I think thai we 
wen:: ahle 10 do that hecau~e we 
didn't like the bureaucracy oJ' it all. 
We were really trying 10 keep order 
but al th ..: same lime, open it ur and 
make it fr iendly." 
A learnIng Experience 

Despite Sabatim 's allempt to 
represent the entire UCSD student 
body th rough A.S., she says that 
the criticism that comes wilh any 
politi cal posilion was one oJ' her 
biggest obstacles to running A.S. 
effect i ve ly. 

"Looking back I detinitely have 
thicker skin now," she said. "You 
have to be able to take reactionary 
blows. and when someone has a 
legitimate concern , be able 10 sit 
down and discuss it with them and 
al least agree to di sagree. I defi nite-
ly took some per onal hilS Ihis 
year, but I guess it just made me a 
sironger person." 

Sabatini says thai one of Ihe 
sirengths of her council was thai its 
members were willing 10 work with 
each other on a personal level. 

"1 think Ihat we weren' t afraid

Issues of Race and Gender 

During her tenure a\ A.S. 
Pre~ident, Saballni rut a lot of 
effort into various social causes. In 
h..:r work against Proposillon 209. 
Sahatini demanded a more elhni-
call y di ver,c student body. con-
trihuled to the Women 's Cenler and 
made time for communily ~ervicc, 
as we ll. 

Her passion for soc ial work has 
mOli vated not onl y her ac tions at 
UCSD for thc past four yea rs. but 
her career choice. as well. 

"I Ihink I will be gelling my 
master's Ideg reel in puhlic health 
and work in policy and education 
in under-served and tradilionally 
marginali zcd comm unil ies," 
Sahatini said. "I want to work wilh 
low-income co mmunities. The 
Ihings I feel reall y passion ale for 
are ocial justi ce issues, and puhlic 
health is kind of a bridge bet ween 
Ihe sciences. which I have a pas-
sion for, and the social service 
whidl I definilely have a passion 
for and so publi c health is a logical 
Ihing for me 10 get in lo." 

During her stay at UCSD, 
Sabatin i worked with issues con-
cerning women and people of 
color. She currently se rves as one 
of six undergraduate women on the 
Chance llor's Advisory Commitlee 
on the tatus of Women. 

"We' re looking al a courle of

"My .::xperiem:e was il1lere~ t ­

rourth in a line of CSD female 
president5. but I was the onl y 
woman presidenl throughoul the

Ihat was brought up a 101. I th ink 
that there were times I felt that I 
was being queMioned, not because ' 
of any reason. other than that t was 
a woman. 

Sabatini's concern about 
UCS D's treatment of people of 
co lor is an eX lension or her interest 
in women 's issues. 

"I Ihink thai deli nitely we arc 
severe ly underrepresented in 

regard~ to some ethnic groups and 
thai is somelhing I Iried 10 addres, 
as A.S. president and during my 
entire time at UCSD." she said. 
"We have a rrohIcm al UCSD in 
terms of rec ruiting students or 
color and low-income students 
onto the campus and somelh ing 
needs to be done 10 reach out 10 
Ihese cOl11munities to let them 
know w.e want them to come." 

She plans 10 continue her 
activism in Ihese area, Ihrough 
ex tensive community service nex t

SABATINI: 
Presidency required

Continued from page 1S 

" I feel like I have given a 101 lu 
the U SD communi ty in the last 
four years, but I really wan t to do 
some work in southeast San Diego 
working with the communities of 
color," she said. 

Sabatini firmly believes that 
UCSD students should give com-
munity service more imponance. 
H owever, she doe~ reali7.e Ihat 
"being in La Jolla it is very hard to 
enti ce student ~ to do community 

~ervice becau~e you don ' t see a lot 
that necd~ to happen. But we need 
to come up with ,0111e kind of 

l11echant~m to get Mudcnts in to 
downtown an Diego, which needs 
to havc [!Cople working dall y in 
Ihe~e area~." 

Sahallnl ~ay' thai making com-
munity ~crvi(,;e more acceh~lhlc tu 

SD , tuden t, could change the 
perception that CSD ,tudcnts arc 
more apathetic and les, aclive than 
average college ~tudenb . She 
encourages i nd i vidua I ,earches for 
an apprupriate balance belween 
acadcmics and sucial activities. 
UCSD Is Not Entirely Apathetic 

" I don't think II 'S that CSD 
studenls arc apathetic," she said. "I 
think academically we are the 11105t 
un-apathetic student body probahly 
in the nlted States. Becau,e we 
are \0 academit.:ally unapathetic. II 
kind of nece" itales le\\ Intere,t III

dent body should he commended

and wcial opportunitie s augment 
an education and that needs to hap-
pen. So, J think to a degree we are 
apathetic in a socia l and political 
sen e and I think that needs to 
change, but I don't think we are 
apatheti c in genera!." 

Sahatini, while maintaining 
high prai se for UCSD' stellar aca-
demic reputatiOn, raises common 
concerns of consequent ly stagnant 
and neglected social lives. 

" I think that the siudent .budy uf 
SD is an amating population -

highly intelligen t and very dedicat -
ed to Ihei r education," Sabatini 
\aid. " And yeah. I would like to ~ee 
a better halance hctween the acade-
miC ,Ide o f thing, and the ,ocial 
"de of thing s. Our learning ,hould-
n' t ull take place in a cla~sruom 
with a book. but we need tu be able 
to apply ou r knowledgc now." 

Sahatlni ,ay" CSD studenh 
need 10 auopt a more a~tive role in 
ex pre"ing their belieb and thclr 

c()n~crn~ . 

"1 think that all college sllIdents 
need to reali/c their placc in ~oci­

" Although we arc here gcttlllg our

coupled with interest and oneern. 
is the key. 

" 1 would hope that every UC D 
student would take it upon them-
selves to become socia ll y active 
and politically aware, to be 
involved in the politi cal process 
and have their voice heard because 
it is our future thai is being decided 
right now," she said. 

Despite the pressure, crit icism, 
and sacrillces her job as A.S . presi -
dent entailed , Sabatini is quick to 
point out that the positive aspects 
far outweighed any negative con -
siderati ons. Despite her at UCSD 
over the past four year, Sabatini 
believes the fight is far from over, 
and hands over her position in the 
hopes that her work will be contin -
ued. 

" I love UCSD with the adden-
dum that there arc problems here 
Ihat -need to be IIxed," Sabatini 
,a id. "I am proud to be a student 
here. Ihi s an academically amallng 
insli tuti on, and we should all I'cel 
pridc for being studen ts here. But 
there arc things that need tu be 
changed here for it to be a sc hool 
for students to love. I love It, but 
with the understanding that a lot of 
things need to be changed."

" We kind of underachieved a bit. 
We just didn ' t come through.

Continued from pace 20 
week. 

Coach of the year was a toss-up 
but the final nod goes to the men and 
women's volleyball coaeh, Duncan 
McFarland. While cases can be made 
for any number of coaches in the 
department, McFarland, during his 
first year in both positions, led the 
women to the NCAA Quan erllnals 
and a season record of 24-7. 

On the men's side, McFarland led 
a Tri ton squad that had been a peren-
nial doonnat in the Division I Moun-
tain Pacific Sports Federation to upset 
victoriesothertwotop- IOsquads. The 
Tritons also received the No. I rank-
ing in Division III. Moreover, 
McFarland put together the most alii-
letic perfonnance by a coach. as thc 
fonner national team member com-
peted in the inaugural Chancellor's 
5K and linished just behind the host.

MVPofthe Year 
I'm pulling my hair out trying to 

determine the MVP of the year. I 
could make a ea e for any numberof 
athletes, but I guess we all ha \Ie to 
make tough decisions. So here it 
goes. For the women, ) have to go 
with the soccer duo of Ele Johnson 
and Lauren John on. 

These two garnered the fall award 
after leadi ng the Tritons to their 
second consecutive national title . 
The Johnson and Johnson combo 
led UCSD to a record of 2 1- \ and 
provided the most potent offensive 
attack in the nation. Ele was named 
a 1997 All -American while, in the 
award forhiggest slight. Lauren was 
left olT the squad.

Methodist 
Takes Title 
GOLF: The Monarchs 
crui ed to victory at the 
Divi ion III Nationals 

By Sean Rahimi 
Sports Editor 

It wa n' t enough that Methodist 
College took a 24-stroke lead in the 
last two days of competition at the 

NCAA Divi sion 
III Championships 
i n West ervi lle , 
Ohio. Mother a· 
ture had 10 get in-
volved, too. 

Playing amid 
40-50 mph winds 

at the Medallion Club, the UCSD 
golf squad could not mount a late 
charge to get into the top five. They 
sl ipped instead to eighth-p lace over-
all. 

The fourth-seated Tritons were 
not the only team to see it cores 
skyrocket. After seven suh-300 
scores through the first two round~ , 
host Onerhein College hot the low-
est tcam-total of 318. On Friday, 
Mother ature cased up a hit, and 
the Monarchs cruised to their sixlh 
title in seven years, with a four-day 
LOtal of I 191 - 35 trokes ahcad of 
the nearesl competitor, Greensboro 
College. 

For seniors Amie Campbcll and 
Brian Bazzel , the tournament was a 
disappointing end to their Triton 
career . 

'" think they were di appointed 
more on the last day, when we 
weren' t able to move up," Greg 

beruaga sa id. "There were only 
five or six trokes that separated us 
from fourth or fifth place, and we 
weren't able to move up to the top 
five ." 

UCSD fini ~hed in eighth place, 
with am pbell posting the lowc,t 
individual Triton score - 309, good 
for 19th place. Along with Greg 

heruaga, Bal/.el finished one 
~troke hack with a 3 10. leremy 
Byrd's 318 was good enough for 
fourth on the squad, and freshman 
lame~ Donahoe rounded out the fivc 
with a four-day total of 328 . 

" That second day wa, very Iln-
