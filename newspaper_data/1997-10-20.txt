"Megan's Law" is unfair and 
puts the lives and safety of 
released criminals in danger 
By Jenny Nicholson 
Staff Writer 

Neighborhoods throughout 
California arc in massive turmoil 
from thc implemcntalion of 
"Megan's Law," a new law 
dcsigned to curh scx offenders. 

Megan's Law is a three-pari 
statute: I . Police can notify indi -
viduals and affeclcd community 
groups about Ihe pre~ence of a 
scx offcndcr in their cOlllmunity. 
2. Policc may advcrtise to an 
entire community, in any way 
they see fit , that a high-risk scx 
offender has movcd into thcir 
ncighborhood. 3. Thc "Megan's 
Law" CD-ROM, which li sts Ihe 
photos and stati st ics of scx 
offenders, is available al police 
stations across the state. 

Megan'S Law is unconstitution-
al as well as ineffectivc. The statutc 
denies convicted sex offenders 
their constitutional right to privacy, 
puts their lives in danger and wi II 
succeed only at driving registered 
offenders underground rather than 
acting as an effective means of 
keeping an eye on them. 

Our judicial system and 
Constitution were designed to pro-
tect the rights of each and every 
American- and that includes sex 
offenders. Privacy is one of those 
rights and is one to which sex 
offenders, like all Americans, are 
entitled. One might argue that 
when the sex offender commiucd 
his crime, he forfeited his claim to 
those rights. That may sound good, • 
but our judicia.1 syslem tells us oth-
erwise. 

A sex offender goes 10 lrial, is 
given ajail sentence, fulfills his sen-
tenCe and is paroled. By the stan-
dards of the judicial system, the 
offender has paid his debito society, 

and is now a free man. As free men, 
paroled olfl!nders should be entitled 
to the pri vacy thai all free men 
enjoy. When an offender's nl!lgh-
bors can go down to their local 
police department and acces~ his 
record .... how much freedom I ~ that? 

Murder is no less of a crimI!, 
but 187 CD-ROM doc~ nol ex i,t. 
Drunk driving is a fe lon y, hut I 
have yet to sec conviclcd drunk 
drivers, I!vl!n those whose reck -
lessness was murderous, forced 10 
drive around with red flags on 
their cars. 

If we arc going to brand one 
kind of cri minal for Ihe rest of hi s 
life, then we should br..lIld thelll 
all. Telling a man that he has paid 
his tillle and then forcing him to 
wear Ihe co mputerized version of 
a scarlet leller is not freedom . 

The most unfair aspect of lhe 
CD-ROM is the fact thaI convict-
ed sex offenders arc not allowed 
to view their own records. Why 
can their neighbors,· Ihe grocer, 
the milkman and the pool man an 
offender's record, but he himself 
cannot look at his own files'! If a 
man's privacy is to be denied, it is 
ridiculous to tell him thll he can-
not look at the "private" propeny 
of the police department. 

Megan's Law also puts the ' 
lives of offenders in danger. Even 
though these people have com-
milled the most heinous of 
crimes, they are still entitled 10 
safety. What good will Megan's 
Law really do'! If someone sees 
that the man who lives two doors 
down is a sex offender, are they 
going to leave it at that and just 
tell their kids not to walk past Mr. 
Smith's house? I think not , 

Consider the case of oonvictcd

Informing the public about sex offenders will 
prevent recidivism and protect our children 
By Megan Klein 
Opinion Editor 

In May of 1995, Jesse 
Timmcndequas was found guilty 
for the brulal kidnapping, rape and 
murder of 7-year-old Megan 
Kanka. Timmendequas, a twice-
convicted sex offender, lured 
Megan into his house across the 
street from her own, raped her, beal 
her and killed her in an aHempt to 
silem:e the only witness lo his 
vicious crime. 

This brutal assault on an inno-
cent child galvanized President Bill 
Clinton. overwhelmingly suppon-
ed by Ihe House, to sign "Megan 's 
Law." The law aims to place the 
safety of America's children as the 
number one priority and requires 
statcs to notify communities when 
a se1\: offender moves into neigh-
borhoods. Parenls living in such 
neighborhoods would now Ix: able 
to defend their children from such 
tragic ends as Megan's , 

Megan 's father, Richard Kanka , 
felt that "we had a responsibilily as 
parents to protect her from harm 
and feel thaI we have failed her." 
Her mother, Maureen Kanka, felt 

thai if "Megan's Law" had been 
effected whcn her daughter' s vio-
lenl death occurred, Megan would 
be alive today. 

Yet, thi s law has come under 
attack by both politicians and citi -
zens alike. Many feel that this law 
is a violation of the crimi nal 's right 
to privacy and that il will cause 
thcm to live in fear of scared and 
vigilanl neighbors. 

"Megan's Law" will create 
more good than harm and will actu-
ally prevent sex offender recidi -
vism while prioritizing the safety 
of our children above the privacy of 
dangerous criminals. 

Pri sons arc hardly an effective 
way of preventing felons from 
repeating criminal activity once 
released. There arc not many reha-
bilitation programs and the existing 
ones seem to be incapable of 
changing convicted felons' ways. 
Furthermore, many criminals are 
given the oplion to enter these pro-
grams. 

Sex offenders arc an extreme 
case in this recurring trend. 
Numerous studies have proven that 
sex offenders are more likely to 

repcat crimes once relcascd from 
jail than other convicted felons. 
This high rale of rccidi visill must 
be controlled to keep children and 
other defenseless people safe. An 
effective way to contain this 
appalling statistic is to make those 
who are responsible for these help-
less people aware of the dangers 
that may be living next door. 

There is no question that publi -
cizing the addresses and photos of 
sex offenders will cause their lives 
to be harder than that of a law-abid-
ing cilizen. Yet this awareness of 
their presence will help to keep sex 
offenders from recommitting 
cnmes. 

Raul Meza was convicted for 
attempted murder in 1975 in Texas, 
served five years, and released on 
parole. He then tortured, raped and 
strangled third-grader Kendra Page 
in 1982, served prison time until 
1993, and was again released. 

Meza's release was heavily pub-
licized heavily in newspapers and 
on television in an elTon to keep 
him from offending again. And it 
worked, The watchful eyes of the

Two days after a neighbor realized 
he was an offender. his car was fire-
bombed. Or. to a lesser extent, the 
case of Sidney Landau? 

When he was paroled, officers 
walked door to door in his new 
neighborhood with nyers announc-
ing his arrival. People protested on 
his front lawn and some even called 
the police every time he left his 
home. These cases simply highlight 
the fact that the destructive aspects 
of the law outweigh the modicum of 
merit it actually holds. 

Even if neighbors do not react to 
such an extent, would a sex offend-
er, even if reformed, ever be able to

Many people argue that offenders 
should not be able to lead a normal 
life because of the high rate of recidi -
vism in sell offense cases. It seems to 
me that the best way to drive a sex 
offender to recommit his crime is 10 
constantly, ceaselessly remind him 
that he is a sex offender and never 
allow him to be anything else. 

In this light, Megan 's Law is nol 
an effective means of keeping 
walch over sex offenders. Rather, I 
believe that the law will only suc-
ceed in driving sex offenders 
underground and back to Ihe 
lifestyle that put them on the list in 
the fi rst place. 

Furthermore. consider what 
would happen if a paranoid neighbor

It is this kind of social responsi-
bility that will prevent convicted 
sex offenders not only from com-
milling crinles again, but from 
commilling Ihem in the first place. 

If this public awareness is the pun-
ishment for committing sex crime . 
then the threat of it may prevent some 
people for committing them in the 
lir,t place. Today the threat of serving 
half of a IS-year senlence is hardly 
ngid enough to prevent crimes. 
Tough punishment is needed to lessen 
Ihe appeal of ~uch homfic action~.

sex offender. It is entirely possihle, 
cspecially when there is inaccurate 
information about 2/3 of the offend-
crs on the CD-ROM. Basically, citi-
zens arc going to their local police 
departments, looking at inaccurate 
infomlation and trying to dig up dirt 
on their neighbors. 

Now old ladies don 'l have to 
peek through their venetian blinds 
to get in on the action. they can just 
cruise down to thc police depart-
ment and try to see if any of their 
neighbors resemble a sex offender. 

Those sex offenders on the CD-
ROM are essentially cooperating 
with the authorities. Police are paid 
to keep the bad guys in check. and 
we should let them do Iheir jobs. 
Spend the money that is used on 
the CD-ROMs for preventive pro-
grams or police salaries. Megan 's 
Law is si mply a waste of public 
funds that allows cilizens to satisfy 

pri on to anyone who uses regis-
tered sex offender informal ion to 
commit a felony. And while this 
still may occur in a few isolated 
incidences. most parents are more 
interested in protecling their chi 1-
dren than committing a felon Ihem-
se lves. 

Kelly Clanlon wrote to Tire 
Bakersfield Californian , "I have no 
desire to 'hound ' these offenders or 
be a ·vigilante· ... Uustj give me the 
information I need 10 prolect my 
kIds." 

And mo~t peoplc [lut thi~ Infor-
mation to good usc. Thc nelghbor~

felon in Wa,hington D.C .. were far

their morbid curiosities. 
I readily admit to the reality of 

sex offcnder recidivism. However, 
I do not think that Megan's Law is 
Ihe best way to curb this problem. 
If one wants to do something about 
it, she should look to the justice 
system that paroles offenders. 

I believe that the best way to 
stop recidivism is to hit offenders 
hard on the first offense. Phase out 
pica bargains for first offenders , 
give them hard time and, perhaps, 
they will think twice about recom-
milling. 

We. as citizens. need to let our 
lawmakers know Ihat we have no 
tolerance for sex offenders. If our 
justice system can dole out much 
stiffer sentences, Ihen maybe mea-
sures like Megan 's Law will not 
even need to be considered. 

While in prison sex offenders 
also need to be given intense thera-

Elsworth credits Ihem for helping 
himlo keep his record clean. While 
a few neighbors avoided him, many 
aided him in finding ajob and giv-
ing him the aUention he needed to 
stay in line. 

Not only can citi zens with the 
knowledge of the whereahoulS of 
convicted sex offenders help crimi-
nals to start over while kceping the 
citizens safe themselves, they can 
also aid policc in locating wanled

py. Rather than locking offenders 
up and forgelling about them, there 
should be programs designed to get 
to the root of what drives them to 
commit. If the underlying force 
behind sex offenders can be found , 
then perhaps we can phase out mul -
tiple offenses entirely. 

Whether or not we like it, sex 
offenders are as human as we are, 
and are thus entitled to the same 
rights we have. Singling them out 
for harassment, possible violence 
and a definite cold shoulder from 
the entire community will do lillie 
more than to make them act like the 
criminals whom we are so intent on 
reminding them that they are.

"We came from such different 
ends, me being an actiVIst and him 
being someone from the past who 
tri ed to crush student protests, but 
we both respected each other and I 
really learned a lot," Falk said. "We 
each recognized that we had some-
thing to learn from the otner."

STUDENTS EXPLORINC ALTERNATIVE WAYS 
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES CAN TURN TO 
UCSO's RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS 

In 1994 Studenl Run Tclevi~ion (SRTV) hit the airwaves. Variety is Ihe key to thb stalion in which the programming, direction and lal-
en l is drawn exc lusively from the UCSD student 
body. Another on-campus stallon which also 
focuses on diverslly in programming is KSDT -
only it is for the airwaves. 

The shows on SRTV reneci an eclecti c view-
pOInt , with programming including bits from 
Koala TV, news stories and a punk video show. 
The station has even reL:enlly aired a dating 
game. During Ihe lag ti me when there is no pro-
gramming available, a billboard containing infor-
mation on the Siallon is po"ed wi th music play-
ing in the background. 

Typi cal mainstream musical selections and 
,hows are not a p;ut of the regularly slated pro-
gramming for these I wo alternati ve campus sta-
tions . rf il is a regu lar se lection on MTV or Star, 
the chances that it wi ll be played on KSDT or 
SRTV are s li m. The~e stations provide exposure 
for music, shows and ideas that are not regularly 
a part of pop culture. 

SRTV volunleers say Iheir goal is to empha-
size a diverse display of arti sti c mediums. 
Miguel Rui z, the KSDT station manager, who is 
also fami li ar with SRTV productions, says that 
the shows are a va luab le commodi ty to UC San

V A Department Broadens Media Major 
By Dinah Chol 
Guardian Reporter 

Except fo r the random "art 
projects" scattered around campus 
that raise a few eyebrows and pro-
voke confused glancL:s, UCSD 's 
Visual Arls departmenl here al 
UCSD i~ oflen unnoli ced and 
unappreciated. 

The simulation of a crashed 
airplane thai sudde nly appeared 
one day on Ihe Warren Mall last 
year is but one examp le. 
Accordi ng to media major, Alvin 
Tsang, Ihe Visual Arts (VA) 
department has remained hidden 
from mainstream student life, but 
has made ils prescnce known 
more subtl y around campus. 

"We ' re like a part of Ihe under-
ground ... it's around, bUI no one 
really takes notice thai iI 'S here ; 
it's almost a whole separate pari 
of UCSD," said Tsang. 

But, like a diamond in the 
rough , th e UCSD vi sual art~ 
department has evolved wi th cur-
ren! Irends, absorbed the new 
innuences, and polished ils pro-
gram. 

The VA deparlment has recent -
ly expanded through a long-awai t-
ed addilion to their undergraduate 
majors. Now st udents L:an pursue 
a degree in art hI sto ry/theory/crit -
icism, ~tudio arl or media, and 
further focus their studies with 
three differenl emphases within 
the media major: pholography, 
fi 1m/video, and Ihe latesl addi tion, 

computer art. 
The lechnica l emphasis is new 

to the departmenl thi s year, and 
Ihe visual arts depart men! 
believes il has the pOlenlial 10 ~ 
open lucralive cureer doors for 
st uden ts, by keeping Ihern up 10 
speed wilh Ihe lutes l Irends in Ihe 
"industry" digital med ia and 
computer art. 

When asked whit'h direction 
Ihe VA department is headed, and 
how it wi ll adapt to Ihe rapidly-
changi ng industry, Megan 
Cunningham, Ihe undergraduale 
slaff advisor, said thallhe lechnol-
ogy of the fUl ure demands an 
ex lensi ve computer-arl part ner-
ship, and Ihat the VA departmenl 
desires to meet the demand 
accordingly. 

Along with the introduClion of 
Ihe new computer emphasis in the 
media major, the department i~ 
hiring new facully to bnng va lu-
ahle computer art skills 10 UCSD. 
Among the~e is Adriene Jcnik, a 
media artisl and former associale 
engi neer al Disney Online, whose 
previous work led her 10 hecome a

Jeremy Paul Cole, born on August 
24, 1976, came to UCSD from 
Venlura, California. A senior at Muir 
College, he is a Political Science major 
with a double minor in History and 
Tbealer. 
Ca.InI to hme 

Cole has been the station mallller 
of Muir TV, on Channel 20, for the lUI 
two )'OII'S. 

"Muir TV was just started my 
sophomore year. It kind of started 
my freshman year a little bit, but not 
really. I just went to meetings 
because I wanted to do TV - ['m an 
actor. So, 1 got involved and became 
friends with all the people. There 
were only four of us at the time, 

They said, 'okay we need a stalion 
manager. ' I looked around the room, 
and no one [volunteered). I said "I'll 
do it' . And that was it , ] was station 
manager. 

"I've got two shows on Muir TV. 
One of them is 'The Joiot'and that's on 
Monday niJhts. That's skctch-comedy. 
The way thIl ataI1ed was my IIOpbo-
more ye., my roomma&cs, my neip. 
bor, and [ would get really tanked -
we'd have the camert and just make 
stuff up. Everything we ever did was 
ad-Jibbed. 

"Actually, they wouldn't air the 
first show. The first sbow gOl censored 
becaUiC we portrayed illelll druls and 
alcohol in the Muir apartments. We 
pretended 10 smoke weed and drink

Whiskey. Oh. and I had a bong too. No 
one believes me, bul we really didn't 
do it because we didn't have any. 

'1'he other show I have is called the

Student-Run Programmi-ng Offers Alternatives 
Local and unconventional music are given voice at KSDT, UCSD's radio station 

By Nikki Lee 
Guardian Reporter 

Thirty years ago, K SDT, Ihe 
UCSD student radio station, was 
fanned in a gardge al Pacific Beach, 

Today. il is broadcasl from with· 
in the old Siudent Center, and boaslS 
an eclectic variety of programming, 
music, and radio personalities to 
~erve the UCSD communily. 

Caro lyn Fang i~ one of KSOT's 
newest DJ's and remembers her firsl 
episode on air earlier Ihis year. 

" I just kind of gal lost and there 
was a lut of dead air, hUI people 
came in and helped me OUI," said 
Fong, 

When asked whal had prompted 
her 10 joi n Ihe completely student· 
nm organization, Fang said, " \'m in 
Ill y ~econd year at Muir, and I 
haven'l dec ided what I want to do, I 
wanted to do something fun with Ihe 
extra time on my hand~ - some· 
thing different, unconventional." 

So far, she has had no regrets -
Fong often mentioned Ihe amicabili· 
ty of her co-worker~ and the relaxing 
environment of the stalion as some 
of the mosl positive aspects of her 
new job. Her only complall1t was the 
lack of callers who respond to her 
show. 

"Call in," she said , 'Talk 10 me. I 
have lots of free Sluff 10 give away." 

KSDT often ha..~ movie passes, 
posters, and T·shirts fClr devoted lis· 
teners. Occasionally, lucky callers 
can even win concert tickets. a~ 
KSDT works in conjunction with 
loca l venues like SOM A , the 
Cashah, and the Soul Kitchen . 

On one wall of the KSOT studio 
is a color·coded chan indicating the 
different music genre, avai lahle in 
Ihe studio, The SI:IIIO" plays ja7l, 

fo lk , power pop. country, punk. reg·

Does the media affect 

you? If so, in what way? 
Interviews by Marc Comer 

Photography by Dave Lubitz 

"Yeah, the media affects 
me. The media control s 
what people think by por-
traying events in ways that 
suit their needs . When 
news is broadcasted, peo-
ple believe the news to be 
true, regardless of whether 
or not it's biased." 

Wayne Chen 
Revelle Senior 

"It affects me but only 
when it's personal, when 
it's a human interest story. 
Princess Diana 's death 
really affected me. I don 't 
really think about the big 
things going on interna-
tionall y becau se we' re 
enclosed in our own little 
UCSD world ." 

Desir •• Howard 
Roosevelt Sophomore 

"I don ' t know if l'm 
affected by the media but I 
believe everything they tell 
me." 

Mlk. Giancola 
Muir Junior 

"Personally, I don ' t 
think the media affects me 
too much because I'm 
trapped in my own little 
world. t don't get the 
newspaper and I don 't 
watch that much T. Y. So 
I'm totally oblivious to 
whatever happens around, 
me." 

Laurel Cliff 

"It affects you because it 
shows you what's outside 
of your little world. Being a 
college student it's hard to 
pay attention and see 
what's going on around 
you. You can totally be 
unaffected if you don't pay 
attention but if you do pay 
attention, you are affected,"

Women Take Two More 
THE BEAT GOES ON: With victories against Chapman College and 
Division I University of Hawaii, the womenhad a nice weekend at home 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

Weekends in beautiful San 
Diego are meant to be enjoyed. 
Warm wcather and blue skies pro-

vide the best 
backdrop for a lit-
tle R&R. You can 
get a lillie sun at 
the beach or make 
it a night out on 
thc town. For 
members of the 
UCSD women 's 
soccer squad , 

however, this past weekend wasn't 
quite what they had in mind. 

What a dumb question. 
After two shutout wins, includ-

ing a 3-0 drubbing of Hawaii on 
Sunday, it's safe to say the Tritons 
don ' t need anyone second-guessing 
their ability. After defeating a 
pesky Panther squad 1-0 Friday 
night on a late first half goal, 
UCSD returned to the field yestcr-
day afternoon and once again took 
care of business, notching its 12th 
shutout of the season. 

"They played exceptionally 
wcll," Hawaii Head Coach 
Pinsoom Tenzing said. "We didn't 
deserve to be a Division I team out 
there today. Our transition game 
was temble. We 've been decimated 
by injuries in the backfield and it 's 
tough to stick in freshman back 
there." 

attack every t I me. Defenders Janine 
Harispe, Maricela Oceguera, Lisa 
Wlikin on and Alison Hurley kept 
their cool and prevented Hawaii 
from notching a goal . 

"It took us 15 minutes to get 
into the game," Triton Head Coach 
Brian McManus said. "We played 
all the starters in the Chapman 
game Friday night so it took a 
while for us to get the legs going. I 
was really pleased with our attitude 
today. We came In here not wanting 
to lose to anybody - whether it 's 
Divsion I or III. We played Ivery] 
well today."

school - ~ignaling the subsequent 
onset of midterms - thc Tritons 
played a hungry Chapman squad 
Friday night and thc Divi~ion I

~omc people's minds was whcther 
thc two-timc defc!'\ding champion~

Hawaii started Sunday 's contest 
with a Ourry of action, pres~uring 
the Triton defense. UCSD, howev-

After Wilkinson made a great 
save at the goal line on a comer 
kick rebound, UCSD began to gain 
momcntum. Twenty-two minutes 
into the IIrst half, senior forward 
Lauren Johnson bent a comer kick

where Freeburg got up in the air for 
a header directed at the Hawaii 
goalkeeper. Rainbow Wahine nel-

,aid Van Arsdale. 

Thi , week is all the time the 
team has left for adjustments, as 
conkrcnce IInals arc this weekend 
in Pomona. The California College 
Athlctic Association is made up of 
Division II teams (asidc from 
UCSD) though the Tritons have 
had little trouble dealing with that 
level of opposition this year. The 
womcn face some stiff competi-
tion, but both mcn and women havc 
comc to ex peet success. 

''The women have a real tough 
race coming up. Their region is 
more competitivc," said Klinger.

all of that practice to work. 

So here is all of the important 
information : the race is on Fri., 
Oct. 24 at high noon and it starts on 
the North Campus Field, which is 
right next to RIMAe. If you want 
to be sure that you get your hands 
on onc of the T-shirts, you need to 
registcr early, as in not on the day 
of the race. So grab an entry form, 
five dollars and go to the Athletic 
Department on the fourth noor of 
RIMAe. 

Be sure to wave to Chancellor 
Dynes, he'll be the middle-aged 
man that you'll be blowing by.

LET'S PLAY TWO: Playing a couple of night games before the home crowd at RIMAe Field, the men's soccer team shut

That's right. 
It 's not all fasl

here. We're dealing With a senou, 
i ssue - our department was 
informed thaI thi s would be an ofT-
year ror the UCSD men', soccer 
team and, obviously, Ihat was not 
the truth. 

After Saturday night'> 3-0 wi n 
against UC Santa Cru t and Fnday 
night 's 2-0 victory againsl 
Chapman University, the Tritons 
are now 10-2-2 in thi s supposed 
" rebuilding" year.

home g,lIm:~ agam,t Div"ion iii 
nval Chapnian on Frida) and then 
UC Santa Crul the vel) next night, 
but the Triton .. took care of busi -

n c~s . The \\:hcdule sounds lOugh, 
but the Triton, knew that if they 
(;ou ld j u ~t get by Chapman, the 
Banana Slug~ from Sanla Cruz 
were not gOlllg to be much of a 
threat. 

The Panthers came to town wi th 
a 10·3-1 record . and were ready to 
go to any length to beat the Tritons. 
They played an ex tremely phYSical 
game, which evenlually deteriorat -
ed into dirty hacking. 

The Tritons responded with 
some aggressive play of their own; 
all told , there were nine cards 
divvied out among the two rival s. 

" It 's been one hell of a ride so 
far," Triton Assistant Coach Ted 
Przyby lek said. " We're so young 
and we just didn ' t expect to have 
this type of a record. Now we're in 
good shape." 

The Tritons got their two goals 
in the first half, the firsl being a 
heautiful one by forward Anthony 
Funicello. He took a cross from 
forward Brady Bernard and 
slammcd i t homc. The second was 
a penall y kick goal, easily put away 
by the Tritons' leading scorer, mid· 
fielder Cameron Adams. 

Claire Schne'der/Guardlan 
Hang Time: Freshman midfielder Dana Cariss (22) battles for a ball in the air with a pesky Chapman 
Panther. The Panthers gave the Tritons a battle on Friday, but UCSD was able to win the war, 2-0. 

The second half was entertain-
ing for the rowdy crowd of ovcr 
400, hut that was j ust because the 
game ha,ically turned inlo a street 
fight. With the UCSD Pep Band 
and even the UCSD cheerl eaders in 
attendance, the fans tried to wi ll the 
Triton~ to another goal; what thcy 

got, though. was a superhuman per-
formance from Triton goaltender 
Lucas CUrlolo. 

Panthers should have scored at 
least Iwo goals. but Curtolo's acro-
batics and reflexes preserved the 
shutout. 

Ihat this would he an easy game 
even before the conte,t hegan. Firsl 
or all, the Banana Slugs sported a 
2- 11 rel:ord. Second of all, their 
uniforms didn't even match. Some 
Slugs had dark blue shorts, others 
had lighter ones. Some S lugs had

How To Beat Your 
Chancellor's Butt 

Hey, It\' that time 01 thc ycar 
again. No, I'm not talking ahout 
pro footha II , hasehall or any of 
that other stuff that nobody 
wants to read about. It 's time for 
something important. That 's 
right - II 'S time for the 2nd 
Annual Chancellor's Challengc 
5K on Oct. 24. 

Now before you break down 
in tears over the thought of trav-
eling three miles without the usc 
of a motor, let me tell you some 
of the great things involved in 
this race. 

First, and most importantly, 
you get to go head to head with 
Chancellor Rohert Dynes in a 

no- hold~-bafred da~h to thc fin -
ish line. Pondcr thi ~ : what heller 
way to shoIN him what you real-
ly think ahout tUiti on, cla~s 
~chedullng or how much heller 
you look In running \horts than 
he doe, than hy \urging ri ght 
past him and ki cking a lillie dust 
up in hiS face'!

The Triton defense also began to

also began to pay ofT, with redshirt 
freshman Jamie Hackleman and 
sophomore Jen McLain each ~park ­

With the score ti ed at three in

behind the servil:e line and fired off
