Members of the Warren College 
Council voted yesterday to hold 
a joint music festival with Sixth 
College instead of staging the 
annual Warren Live! concert. Sixth 
College’s fifth annual Kuncocshun 
festival will take place on May 8 in 
the Sixth College Quad. 

Earlier this quarter, WCC 
President Colin Scholtz and 
members of the Warren Concert 
Commission decided to postpone 
Warren Live! until next fall after 
realizing the May 8 date was prob-
lematic.

“We discovered that the day 
before was Warren Semiformal, and 
the day after was Transfer Admit 
Day,” Warren Senator Katie Buzas 
said. “The staffing would have been 
shorthanded to do three events 

three days in a row. The Warren 
Concert Commission was under the 
impression that they would try to 
get a later date and that the contract 
wasn’t binding yet.”

However, because Associate Vice 
President of Programming Garrett 
Berg had already extended a formal 
offer to the headlining musical acts 
after being given the go-ahead by 
Warren Concert Commission Chair 
Eric Mendoza, A.S. programming 
was no longer willing to renegotiate 
the date of the festival.

“We had actually outbid another 
venue in San Diego to get an artist, 
and felt obliged to book the commit-
ments,” AVP of Athletic Relations 
Peter Benesch said. “It became an 
issue of reputation. One of the rea-
sons A.S. was helping out the college 
councils was to improve its reputa-
tion, but Warren was taking actions 
that would hurt that reputation. 
[The decisions] were made behind 
closed doors. We didn’t know this 
was happening; only the Warren 
president and concert commissioner 
knew.”

John Muir College dining facili-
ties Sierra Summit and El Mercado 
will shut their doors for renovation 
this summer, and will remain closed 
until 2010.

Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Director Steve Casad is currently 
settling logistics for the renovation 
of Summit and the relocation of 
Mercado. Casad’s vision for the eat-
eries includes more seating space in 
Summit — one of the most trafficked 
dining halls on campus — and a new 
restaurant to replace the Mexican-
themed Mercado.

Summit and Mercado are the only 
two dining facilities in John Muir 
College that accept students’ residen-
tial dining dollars.

Although Summit will not 
be relocated, a new dining facility 
called Goodies is set to open in the 

Thurgood Marshall Academic Center 
by fall 2009. Unlike Summit, which 
closes at 8 p.m., Goodies will remain 
open until 1 a.m. 

The upper level of Goodies will 
feature a coffee area, sushi bar and 
Whole Foods-style self-service area. 
The lower level is designed as a retail 
market, similar to Earl’s Place in Earl 
Warren College.

Upon the closure of Mercado, a 
new restaurant will open in Eleanor 

Roosevelt College near Cafe Ventanas. 
According to Dolores Ramirez, lead 
food-service worker at Mercado, the 
new menu will feature Central and 
South American fare, including tra-
ditional Salvadoran and Ecuadorian 
dishes.

During renovations, employees 
from both facilities will be reassigned 
to other HDH locations on campus. 

Marshall College will 
house additional dining 
facility featuring sushi 
bar, coffee.

An attempt to economize campus 
transportation services may result in 
new student fees or the elimination of 
the campus-loop shuttle next year. 

The Transportation Policy 
Committee met last week to consider 
new ways of funding campus tran-
sit services — including the Arriba, 

Regents and campus-loop shuttle lines 
— while taking into account the results 
of a campuswide survey of students, 
staff and faculty conducted by Parking 
and Transportation Services which 
indicated that most people would like 
to see the services continued. 

The committee will make a rec-
ommendation to the transportation 
department next month to either enact 
a $50 user fee, implement a campus-
wide $15 student transportation fee or 
to simply reduce campus transporta-
tion services.

The user fee would function as a 
monthly or quarterly pass, and would 
be paid for by those who chose to 
utilize transportation services. A cam-
puswide student transportation fee, 

which would be decided by a student 
referendum, could be either a specific 
quarterly fee or added on to current 
registration fees.

All three options would help 
offset budget shortfalls, as well as a 
recent increase in ridership for the 
Metropolitan Transportation System, 
according to last year’s A.S. represen-
tative on the Transportation Policy 
Committee Peter Benesch. He added 
that public transportation is a self-sus-
taining system, and student fees have 
never been used to fund the depart-
ment. Parking citations and permit 
revenues fund the majority of shuttle 
and transit services, which cost more 

JOSEPH HO/GUARDIAN
Due to financial constraints and the rising cost of UCSD’s partnership with the San Diego Municipal Transit System, the campus transportation department is 
reviewing several options to gather additional funding for shuttle services. One suggestion is a new campuswide student fee.

;]UUQ\��5MZKILW�\W�+TW[M�NWZ�:MVW^I\QWV[

Transportation officials 
seek new funding source 
for shuttle services,
consider eliminating

Miscommunication 
leads A.S. Programming 
to book Warren Live! 
acts ahead of schedule.

than $7 million annually.
The university currently pays just 

over $1 per day for each student who 
utilizes MTS, which is also facing 
budget constraints from state funding 
reductions. Ridership costs are expect-
ed to increase by 25 percent next year.

Director of Parking and 
Transportation Services Brian 
d’Autremont said the burden of fund-
ing public transportation unfairly lies 
on those who pay for parking permits 
and citations, not on those who use 
shuttle services.

“We have to try to figure out how 
to do some cost sharing,” d’Autremont 
said. “My biggest concern at this point 
is that we are fair. My second big-
gest concern is that we are supporting 
public transportation because it is so 
important to pollution [control] and 
sustainability.”

Two studies currently under way— 
one conducted by Transportation 
Services and the other by manage-
ment consulting firm Sundstrom and 
Associates — seek to identify the most 
efficient funding strategies for public 

transportation through focus groups 
and forums, in order to help reduce 
congestion around campus and lower 
greenhouse-gas emissions into the 
atmosphere.

Although d’Autremont said the 

department is “trying to make sure the 
decision is made by the people that are 
affected by it,” Benesch countered that 
the focus group involved in one of the 
studies is comprised mostly of faculty, 
and favors student fees over the elimi-

nation of the campus-loop shuttle. 
A.S. undergraduate representa-

tive for TPC and campuswide Senator 
Emily Chi said she thinks the all-
student transportation fee is the most 
feasible option of the three. While 
the user fee would give students the 
option to decline public transporta-
tion, the student transportation fee 
would require all students to pay for 
the services.

“Even if you don’t take the shuttle 
and you are charged an x-amount fee, 
it is for the greater good,” she said. 

Chi said another option would be 
to completely cut the campus-loop sys-
tem, though she said there is “strong 
support against reduction in service” 
among members of the committee.

D’Autremont said that Parking and 
Transportation Services is constantly 
evaluating and seeking to improve 
campus transportation services.

“We are in a very solid financial 
situation, but we are trying to econo-
mize,” he said.

Scholtz said the heart of the 
problem was miscommunication.

“Given the information present-
ed, we came to the decision that 
we could postpone it, and we were 
under the impression that there 
would be no financial repercussion,” 
Scholtz said. “As much as I have to 
reiterate this, there was bad com-
munication on all sides.”

Late last month, Berg contact-
ed Sixth College Coordinator of 
Student Activities 
Jenelle Dean to sug-
gest that the Sixth 
College Council 
co-sponsor the 
event with Warren, 
since Kuncocshun 
had been planned 
for the same date.

“[The Sixth 
College Council] 
reached out to 
Warren council-
members a couple 
of times and asked 
if they would like 
to do a joint event,” 
Sixth Senator John Cressey said. 
“We were denied at all times.”

Unsure of whether the Warren 
College Council was still opposed 
to combining the two festivals, 
A.S. councilmembers voted last 
Wednesday to allocate $13,671.26 
from their mandate reserves to pay 
the headliners they had booked for 
Warren Live!. 

The lineup has not yet been 
released to the public.

“When A.S. funded the money 
for Sixth on Wednesday, it became 
completely obvious that most of 
WCC didn’t know what was going 

on, and they hadn’t been offered the 
opportunity to decide,” Cressey said. 
“They said ‘no’ initially under false 
pretenses, and due to lack of knowl-
edge about what was going on.”

Buzas and Warren College 
Senator Pam Sran called for an 
informal meeting with Berg, Sholtz 
and AVP of Student Advocacy 
Frank Carroll on April 24. There, 
they decided that Warren College 
should combine its festival with the 
Sixth College festival.

“It was a really 
messy situation,” 
Sran said. “It was 
kind of a major 
lack of communi-
cation on all three 
parties’ parts.”

In accordance 
with yesterday’s 
vote, the Warren 
College Council 
will reimburse the 
A.S. Council for 
the money used 
to pay for the 
bands, as well as 
pay for upgraded 

stage and security costs. 
The Sixth College Council had 

already booked several musical acts 
before the decision to merge with 
the Warren College festival, all of 
which will still be performing at 
Kuncocshun next month.

“Sixth planned the entire event,” 
Cressey said. “We were offered the 
opportunity to take those bands 
and tack them onto the event. We 
wouldn’t have the budget regularly 
to put those bands on.”

They will have the option of either 
reapplying to other dining halls with 
priority over incoming freshman can-
didates, or waiting until the comple-
tion of Sierra Summit’s renovations to 
resume their positions.

Ramirez, who has served HDH 
for 12 years and has 
worked at Mercado 
since its opening 
over five years ago, 
said she is disap-
pointed to see the 
restaurant go.

“I love work-
ing here,” she said. 
“Most of us have 
worked together for 
years, and we are 
very comfortable 
with each other.”

Sierra Summit 
Student Manager 
Laura Comstock said there is cur-
rently excessive traffic in the dining 
hall. During its peak hours, up to 300 
students flood the restaurant. 

Comstock said the remodeling will 
make Summit’s interior less cramped.

Its building frame will not change, 
but the redesigned floor plan puts the 
entrance near the stir-fry area and 

expands the dining area to accommo-
date more students. 

Mercado will be completely 
removed from campus. In the absence 
of its carne-asada tacos and notori-
ous shrimp burrito — a recipe cre-
ated by Ramirez — Comstock said 
she believes that traffic will increase at 

Price Center eater-
ies such as Rubio’s, 
as will business for 
the other dining 
halls.

Muir College 
freshman Susan 
Park said she will 
be inconvenienced 
by the removal of 
both of her college’s 
dining halls. 

“It’s going to be 
pretty sad because 
I’ll have to walk 
farther,” she said. 

“[Compared to other dining halls], 
Summit food is pretty good.”

Sierra Summit is featured on the 
online restaurant guide Yelp.com, with 
many reviews ranking it among the 
best dining halls on campus.

ACADEMICS — The senior-seminar 
program, in place since Fall Quarter 
2006, was designed to facilitate 
closer contact between faculty and 
students through more intimate, less 
academically taxing courses — but 
like so many other student services, 
it now faces extinction.

Rather than cut funding and 
leave the rest up to faculty and their 
respective departments, the Office 
of Academic Affairs should create 
other incentives for professors to 

offer these courses.
According to Barbara Sawrey, 

associate vice chancellor of under-
graduate education, the senior semi-
nars were a small 
casualty within 
the shrinking bud-
get. All budgetary 
decisions concern-
ing instructional 
allocations are 
made by Senior 
Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs 
Paul Drake. Drake 
confers every 
month with a pro-
gram review com-
mittee comprised 
of administrators, 
faculty and two student representa-
tives from Associated Students and 
the Graduate Student Association. 
The committee works with the 

senior vice chancellor and his office 
to recommend how to best organize 
funds and maximize educational 
value for students, and saw elimi-

nating money for 
senior seminars 
as relatively insig-
nificant, given that 
the severity of the 
budget crisis put 
47 faculty position 
searches on hold. 
But freshman sem-
inars retain full 
funding.

“The goal was 
to maintain the 
academic core 
mission,” Sawrey 
said, referring to 

the need to maintain the lectur-
ers, teaching assistants and other 
bare-bones faculty and staff posi-
tions that make it possible to offer 

a wide range of classes at the uni-
versity. Normally, 40 to 50 senior 
seminars are offered annually, with 
each participating professor receiv-
ing a $1,500 stipend that usually 
goes toward research. 

But the elimination of the senior-
seminar program only widens the 
disconnect between professors and 
students. Senior seminars offer the 
rare chance to interact with profes-
sors in a close environment without 
having to stress over a grade — an 
asset for a reccommendation-thirsty 
senior. Seminars also allow profes-
sors to present material they may 
not be able to tackle in a traditional 
four-unit class. In Spring Quarter 
2009, 16 departments and a few 
colleges offered a total of 27 senior 
seminars, with topics ranging from 
“Sex and Democracy” to “Induced

A college student’s first les-son is that capitalism has us by a short conformist leash. 
Of course our natural instinct is 
to deny this completely, citing our 
thick-rimmed glasses and experi-
mental music as markers of unique-
ness. Only problem is, even the 
things we consider alternative are 
usually fabricated by suit-clad men 
who are dedicated to encouraging 
anticonsumerists to consume.

It sounds bad, but we’re used to 
it. I didn’t mind when marketers 
hinted that Gap was too commercial, 
mostly because Urban Outfitters — 
its up-and-coming alternative — 
seemed more stylish anyway. I was a 
little perturbed when Death Cab for 
Cutie’s “Soul Meets Body” became 
part of every store’s Christmas shop-
ping soundtrack, despite the band’s 
self-proclaimed indie image. But 
marketers’ most recent scheme is 
taking anti-consumerist consumer-
ism too far. They’ve commercialized 
our clothes and music, and now 
they’re after our fruit.

Let me explain. This weekend 
I found myself in Costa Mesa at a 
place called the “anti-mall” — a col-
lection of expensive, antimainstream 
stores (including Urban Outfitters) 
that appeal to identity-hankering 
college students. Ignoring that I was, 
in fact, at a mall, I sat down in 
the Gypsy Den — a cafe decorated 
with haphazard thrift-store finds — 
and glanced at the drink menu. 
Unsurprisingly, the menu offered 
a collection of pomegranate- and 
acai-berry-infused beverages.

Which is cool. I like pomegran-
ate and acai berry. They’re yummy 
and they might even be good for 
you or something. But clever mar-
keters have turned them into celeb-
rity fruits that serve as some sort of 
status-marker. You consume them 
if you are 1) bored and disgusted 
with mainstream orange/apple juice, 
2) vaguely concerned about global 
warming or 3) a wealthy, middle-
aged MILF who shops at Whole 
Foods (sorry mom). 

Now that these fruits have 
earned a hip reputation, they’re 
being “infused” in practically 
everything. Celebrities are photo-
graphed with POM teas, magazines 
are plugging acai juice and swanky 
restaurants are adding the pair to 
dishes. They’re even being shoved 
into other random products, just 
to appeal to a certain demographic. 
Häagen-Dazs sells a Brazilian acai 
berry sorbet and Burt’s Bees offers 
a whole line of pomegranate beauty 
products. All the while these com-
panies brag about their products’ 
high antioxidant value and we eat it 
up, though few of us actually know 
what that means or live healthy-
enough lifestyles to feel the differ-
ence.

But there’s really no use in learn-
ing — pretty soon there will be 
a new superingredient to consume 
and we’ll forget all about boring old 
pomegranates and acai berries. I’m 
banking on ginger or horned melon, 
but you never know what our crazy 
capitalist society has up its sleeve.

than scholarships. It’s equally decep-
tive that NSCS does not release these 
two figures in its annual report to 
members. The absence of these fig-
ures is especially evident on the 
poorly explained finance page — a 
half-hearted effort to create trans-
parency. The only chance to see 
any value for the membership fee 
would be directly through individu-
al chapters — which have the largest 
amount of funding — though not all 
chapters receive an equal cut.

UCSD chapter President Brittany 
Boswell said NSCS provided $1,600 
for the chapter’s annual budget. 
This highlights the haphazard and 
alarming way money is distributed 
by the national office, and is baf-
fling considering 300 new members 
were inducted at UCSD this year. 
Meanwhile, NSCS charges addition-
al fees to attend an annual confer-
ence where members discuss ideas 
on leadership; the group asks chap-
ters to subsidize the cost. Despite 
obvious student interest to join the 
organization, NSCS offers little aid 
to members who wish to participate 
in NSCS-sponsored events. 

The chapter does, however, pro-
vide community service in the form 
of a tutoring program at University 
City High School and participation 
in cancer walks such as Relay for 
Life. Past projects included visits 
to an orphanage in Tijuana, which 
UCSD’s chapter paid for without 
soliciting additional member fees. 
The chapter also provides its mem-
bers with free presentations from 
test-prep companies which end 
up advertising — instead of dis-
cussing — test-taking strategies. 
NSCS encourages the sale by pro-
vide members discounted test-prep 
courses.

If NSCS were to allow more of 
the money generated by students’

STUDENT LIFE — “It’s nearly May 
and high time you were recognized 
for your great achievements,” reads 
the National Society of Collegiate 
Scholars recruitment letter. 

These messages are sent to 
high-achieving freshmen and 
sophomores, congratulating them 
and offering admission to an elite-
sounding club. 

Soon, letters will flood campus 
mailboxes, appealing to these stu-
dents’ academic egos and asking 
for their membership. While the 
first letters offer friendly congratu-
lations, hasty followups come with 
an ultimatum: Pay us $75 or this 
coveted offer will never be yours to 
treasure. 

But don’t shell out for the honor 
club — in actuality, NSCS can only 
be politely described as an exceed-
ingly bad bargain for those who join. 

Founded in 1994, NSCS has 
chapters at 228 colleges and univer-
sities nationwide. Its one-time $75 
lifetime membership fee promises 
access to scholarships, special dis-
counts and opportunities to help the 
local community. Though it sounds 
promising, a closer look at how 
NSCS spends its money throws the 
value of membership into question.

NSCS literature brags of offering 
more in undergraduate scholarship 
dollars than any other honor society 
in the country, with awards ranging 
from $250 to $7,000. According to 
tax documentation filed in 2007, 
NSCS paid $115,020 in scholar-
ships — a significant number at first 
glance. However, in the same year 
NSCS had a total revenue of $6.2 
million, nearly 80 percent of which 
came from membership dues. It’s 
troubling that this supposed soci-
ety of scholars would charge such 
a steep entry fee in exchange for a 
handful of scholarships amounting 
to about 2 percent of the organiza-

tion’s entire revenue — especially 
given that scholarship access is its 
main selling point. 

Compare that amount to other 
scholarship-offering honor societies 
at UCSD. Tau Beta Pi — the old-
est engineering honor society in the 
country — indicates that 9 percent of 
its 2007 revenue went to scholarships. 
The psychology honors society, Psi 
Chi, allotted 14 percent of its earnings. 

There is no reason to pay NSCS 
for access to special scholarships 
when there are organizations on 
campus that devote more income 
to their members. And some of 
the most lucrative scholarships on 
NSCS’s Web site are offered by com-
panies that do not require NSCS 
membership, making for an expen-
sive Google search. 

NSCS also lists membership-fee 
waivers as “scholarships.” Though it’s 
admirable that NSCS understands it 
solicits people who may be unable 
to pay the membership fee and is 
willing to let them join, it’s insult-
ing that NSCS considers financial 
need synonymous with academic 
ability. Obtaining a fee waiver does 
not require more academic quali-
fications, so using these waivers to 
pad (by a hefty $4,200, in 2006) the 
total amount of scholarship money 
awarded to members is deceptive. 
Not only does the true amount of 
scholarship money shrink, members 
are not informed of this distinction 
in NSCS’s annual finance report. No 
one should be part of an organiza-
tion that is so misleading, much less 

one that allegedly considers integ-
rity a part of its mission. 

As a nonprofit organization, 
NSCS literature reports that “all 
income is used for the develop-
ment and operation of the society.” 
With the relatively small amount 
of money devoted to scholarships, 
a significant amount would have 
to be spent on the various addi-
tional programs to make this state-
ment true. According to the same 
tax documents, $4.8 million was 
spent on program services such as 
community-service opportunities 
and educational seminars, but these 
vague terms do nothing to detail 
to a potential member just what 
their money would be used for. 
If the NSCS can’t explain what it 
spends its money on to the IRS, 
students shouldn’t expect explicit 
details either. 

NSCS spends close to $2 mil-
lion on day-to-day operations alone. 
While the organization certainly 
returns more to its chapters in total, 
it’s disconcerting how little is dedi-
cated to scholarships. NSCS’s pushy 
letters asking you to pay up and join 
are part of about $700,000 spent on 
mailings. The list of current employ-
ees shows that while eight out of 
the nine board members receive 
no compensation, the founder and 
executive director of NSCS, Stephen 
Loflin, was paid $123,600 for his 
services in 2007.

There is no value in paying $75 
to an organization that spends more 
on its mailings and founder’s salary See NSCS� page 5

membership dues to be reinvested 
on campus, joining the organiza-
tion could become 
worthwhile. NSCS 
should give the 
chapter funding to 
hold test-prep sem-
inars with actual 
information about 
test strategies, or 
create a truly dis-
tinct volunteer 
program within the 
UCSD community. 
But as it stands, 
the entrance fee 
is unjustifiable 
when other student 
organizations can 
provide alterna-
tives at lesser costs. 
The A.S. Council 
Volunteer Connection and UCSD’s 
Center for Student Involvement 
both provide ample opportunities to 
help the community, without a high 

membership fee. 
NSCS has too many misleading 

qualities to be worth joining. An 
honor society that 
calls itself selec-
tive while recruit-
ing members with 
an academic record 
only one quarter 
long is a sign that 
something’s awry. 
Not only does NSCS 
misrepresent how it 
awards students for 
academic achieve-
ment, it doesn’t offer 
enough support to 
individual chapters. 
While NSCS claims 
it can offer the 
world for a few dol-
lars, UCSD students 
already have at their 

fingertips — for free.

Pluripotent Stem Cells: Science Hit 
or Science Hype?”

Though faculty members can 
still work with their departments to 
present a proposal for a senior-sem-
inar course, the associated $1,500 
research stipend will be eliminated. 

While many faculty members teach 
these seminars out of the goodness of 
their hearts, students can expect a drop 
in course offerings.

At a research-focused university 
with merit reviews coming every few 
years, the limited incentive to teach 
an extra class without compensation 
will likely convince professors to opt 
out of the program. One solution is 

to convince faculty that teaching a 
senior seminar without receiving a 
stipend would be looked upon nicely 
by merit-review personnel. Reviews 
are based on teaching, research and 
service — no doubt teaching a semi-
nar course. Sawrey said the Office 
of Academic Affairs recognizes that 
every professor teaching a senior 
seminar is doing so on top of his or 
her normal workload. 

According to Sawrey, Academic 
Affairs is currently considering four 
senior-seminar proposals for Fall 
Quarter 2009 and she said there is 
likely to be some reduction in the 
number of courses offered. Rather 
than eliminate all funding for senior 

seminars, perhaps the Office of 
Academic Affairs could reduce sti-
pends while eliminating some funding 
for the freshman program. According 
to Sawrey, the freshman seminar 
course offerings outnumber senior 
seminars by three to one annually. 

Instituting creative funding com-

Dear Editor, 
The April 23 Guardian editorial 

incorrectly suggested that Student 
Affairs was proposing to redistribute 
registration fees from their intend-
ed purpose of supporting student 
co-curricular services to “academic 
components such as admissions.” The 
opposite is the case.   

In these difficult budgetary times, 
indeed for many decades, Student 
Affairs has sought to preserve the 
distinction between the registration 
fee and its co-curricular uses on one 
hand, and state general funds and 
education fee funds and their mainly 
academic uses on the other. 

Student Affairs, it should be 
noted, is made up of units that utilize 
state general funds and other units 
that use registration fee funds as well 
as campus-based fees in some cases.  
Each unit offers campus programs 
and services appropriate to its fund-
ing sources.   

At UCSD, the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee plays a major 
role in the allocation of registration 
fees.  RFAC has 14 voting members, 
10 of whom are students represent-
ing the colleges, the A.S. Council and 
the Graduate Student Association. In 
addition there is a nonvoting chair, 
who must be a student elected by the 
members. The other RFAC members 
are staff and faculty. 

RFAC, with the consent of the 
vice chancellor of Student Affairs 
many years ago, adopted and con-
tinues to adhere to the UC Council 
on Student Fees’ Standing Policy on 
the Appropriate Use of the University 
Registration Fee, which lists the stu-
dent service units that are inappro-
priate for registration fee funding.  
Included on this list are “enrollment/
registrar/admissions services.” 

UCSD students may rest assured 

that any ideas regarding the pos-
sible allocation of registration fees by 
Student Affairs to departments not 
usually considered for such funding 
under the CSF guidelines would first 
be vetted thoroughly by the RFAC.

Dear Editor,
The Guardian news article (“Pay 

Cuts, Furloughs Likely for UC 
Workers,” April 16) and editorial (“It’s 
Time UC Execs Put Their Mouths 
Where Their Money Is,” April 16) raise 
some important issues, but both miss 
the central issue: the state’s responsi-
bility to adequately support the UC 
system.

First, the actions referenced in the 
news story were not salary increases. 
These were appointments for critical 
positions. In one instance, an individ-
ual is filling two roles for the salary of 
one, saving the University of California 
roughly $320,000 per year. Another 
concerns the appointment of a chief 
financial officer at a salary well below 
the going rate for CFOs to ensure 
strong financial management and to 
identify more ways for the UC sys-
tem to save money. A third individual 
was promoted to fill a vacancy in our 
Washington office, which is a critical 
place for the UC system and California 
to be represented.

Second, the editorial ignores what 
is being done to limit executive pay 
and control costs, and suggests that a 
potential furlough might apply only to 
staff. Here are the facts:

The UC system has instituted a 
systemwide freeze on senior managers’ 
salaries, cut bonuses and incentive pay, 
and reduced the budget at the Office 
of the President in Oakland by $67 
million and the staff by 628 employees 

over the last two years.
UC campuses are curtailing fac-

ulty recruitment, in many cases by 50 
percent or more. This reduces hiring 
of nonteaching staff; severely limits 
spending on nonessential costs such as 
travel; consolidates or eliminates pro-
grams and looks for efficiencies, while 
working to minimize cuts to student 
programs.

If a furlough were to be implement-
ed, it would not apply just to line staff 
— managers would also be included.

Salaries for senior managers repre-
sent less than 1 percent of the universi-
ty’s annual payroll. Reducing executive 
salaries or not filling senior positions 
would have very little impact on the 
budget deficit the UC system is faced 
with.

In the current economic environ-
ment, it is understandable and appro-
priate to be concerned about every 
institutional expenditure, and we wel-
come scrutiny of how the university 
is being managed. It is also important 
that people view financial decisions 
in the proper context, and that the 
public receives a balanced presentation 
of the facts. There are many questions 
and some misconceptions about the 
university’s budget and why state sup-
port is so critical. Guardian readers 
are encouraged to get the facts about 
these issues at universityofcalifornia.
edu/news/budgetmyths.pdf.

The bottom line is that the state’s 
under-funding of the university has 
put the UC system in an impossible 
position: We’re expected to keep the 
university running smoothly, accept a 
growing student population, graduate 
tomorrow’s leaders, hire the best peo-
ple, produce cutting-edge research and 
life-improving innovations and more 
— all with fewer and fewer state dol-
lars. That’s an unrealistic expectation.

The state has a responsibility to its 
citizens to adequately support public 
higher education, and we encourage 
all UC stakeholders, including stu-
dents and student-run media, to help 

us deliver this message to our state 
leaders.

Dear Editor,
The bureaucratic system that has 

plagued our institution has made stu-
dents suffer enough. So why is the 
Parking and Transportation Services 
Office contributing to students’ 
bureaucratic nightmare?

It’s obvious that finding undergrad-
uate student parking on West Campus 
is like striking gold. Desperate stu-
dents unwittingly waste an enormous 
amount of time and gas going from 
one lot to the next, passing by the 
abundance of open “B” and “A” spots 
in order to get a parking spot nearer 
to the center of campus. This is unfor-
tunate because many students miss 
portions of their classes, which may be 
vital for an exam, just because Parking 
and Transportation Services wants to 
make an additional buck with “B” and 
“A” spots. On a daily basis, a number of 
students spend more than 30 minutes 
in Gilman Parking Structure waiting 
on the half floor dedicated to “S” spots. 
That’s right, in a six-floor parking 
garage, there is only half a floor with 
“S” spots and it’s at the very top! For 
a student population of over 20,000 
this seems like an entirely thought-
less arrangement by Parking and 
Transportation Services. The response 
is simply, “Use Regents!”

Telling students to park in the 
Regents parking lot, although valid 
due to the abundance of available 
“S” spots, also shows how much this 
institution cares about its students — 
by pushing us back and making us 
park entirely away from the center of 
campus. This seems contradictory to 
the original purpose of any university, 

which is to serve its students. Faculty 
and staff have a much easier time 
trying to find parking. Almost five of 
Gilman’s floors are dedicated to them, 
in addition to three and a half floors 
in Hopkins Parking Structure, three 
floors in Pangea Parking Structure, 
Lot 207, Lot 206, half of Lot 406, Lot 
510, Lot 502 and more. The worst part 
is the amount of available “A” and “B” 
spots within these lots. Students pass 
by empty spots and floors in Hopkins 
trying to reach the top floor. Similarly 
with Gilman, students have to drive up 
five floors passing many empty spots 
to reach the half floor that is dedicated 
to us. Why are the undergraduate stu-
dent spaces consistently more difficult 
to reach?

This is not an issue of creating more 
“S” spots, but simply an issue of fair 
reorganization of currently available 
spaces. Parking and Transportation 
Services should consider changing 
many of the consistently empty “B” 
and “A” spots at the various structures 
to “S” spots. This would enable stu-
dents to park nearer to a campus that is 
supposed to serve the students, instead 
of having students drive to campus an 
hour earlier just to wait for a parking 
spot, or take the shuttle in from East 
Campus, which doesn’t allow students 
to maximize their time! This would be 
a small gesture in support of UCSD’s 
next generation of scholars.

A new study from 
Scripps Institute of 

Oceanography is
shining a light on
bioluminescent 

worms off the San 
Diego coast.

H ow much control do you have over your own love life? According to Dr. Robert Epstein, former editor in chief of Psychology Today 
and current visiting scholar at UCSD, love doesn’t 
have to wait for Cupid to strike. 

In PSYC 158, an upper-division course on the 
psychology of interpersonal relationships, students 
are learning what exactly makes our heads spin 
and knees weaken when the object of our affection 
is nearby. During each lecture, Epstein leads his 
students through a 15-minute relationship-building 
exercise. And, according to Epstein, nearly every stu-
dent has used one of the techniques from the course 
to improve a relationship outside of class.

“Soul gazing” is a favorite among students, he 
said. During the first lecture, several students volun-
teered to stand in front of the class and gaze into each 
other’s eyes for two minutes.

Gazing is a form of mutual vulnerability that is 
not to be confused with staring, Epstein said. To stare 
is to look at someone intently without permission. 

When two people gaze at each other, they lower their 
defenses and create a bond. 

The class reported finding a 45 percent increase 
in closeness after the gazing experiment.

“[Soul gazing] is the one experiment we’ve done 
so far this quarter that I can actually do outside of 
class,” Thurgood Marshall senior Jeffrey Jair said. “I 
can’t fall backwards into someone’s arms or hold up 
my palm to someone else’s to feel their body heat, but 
I can look into someone’s eyes.”

Epstein’s idea that love can be learned was origi-
nally derived from his research on the practice of 
arranged marriages in Asia. Partners don’t necessar-
ily love or even know each other at the start of the 
marriage, but Epstein found that in many cases, both 
man and wife fell in love over time.

“In the Western world, we tend to believe that 
love is something we entrust to chance,” Epstein said. 
“We leave it up to Hollywood producers to tell us the 

S
hortly after the sun dips below the horizon, puffs of 
sparkling green light glow beneath the ocean’s surface. 
This alluring spectacle, which occurs two days before 
the quarter moon and lasts from 20 to 30 minutes, has 

long mesmerized voyaging sailors. What they may not know, 
however, is that the source of this radiance is a tiny worm, shorter 
in length than a single fingernail. 

Odontosyllis phosphorea, the luminescent fireworm, lives on 
the seafloor of tropical and temperate oceans and is known for its 
mating swarms: Female worms swim to the surface and secrete a 
bioluminescent mucus that attracts males for spawning. 

This mucus emits the green light, which has been observed 
by kayakers and seafarers in waters as nearby as Mission Bay. 
Dr. Dimitri Deheyn and Dr. Michael Latz, marine biologists at  
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, are working to uncover the 
different purposes of the worm’s bioluminescence, as well as the 
protein responsible for the light itself. 

“Hundreds of years ago, locals would say that this was the 
‘spirit of the ocean,’” Deheyn said. “It has been reported many 
times, but few studies have been done regarding the biology of 
the light.”

Through their research, the scientists have already discov-
ered that juvenile worms are able to produce the light as an 
internal flash, rather than the secretion of mucus. Because sexu-
ally immature worms are able to achieve bioluminescence, the 
scientists propose that this internal light cannot be for the sole 
purpose of mating.

“We hypothesize that the bioluminescence could therefore 
have two purposes,” Deheyn said. “One is as a means of defense 
in the small worms, and the other as a visual signal for mating 
in the adults.”

In order to identify the protein responsible for the light, the 

team must isolate the protein in the mucus generated by the 
worms. 

Fifty to 60 years ago, scientists would collect the worms by 
finding the mating swarms and using a dip net, Latz said. They 
would then take the bodies of the worms, grind them and then 
extract the chemicals responsible for the glow.

Deheyn and Latz take a different approach. They gather 
worms from their tubular seafloor homes instead. When the 
worms swarm near the surface, they easily deplete their mucus; 
collecting them from their resting place ensures that the worms’ 
ability to glow hasn’t been diminished. 

In the lab, worms are exposed to potassium chloride, which 
artificially triggers secretion. 

In general, a chemical reaction resulting in bioluminescence 
requires oxygen; based on previous studies, if oxygen is removed, 
no light should be produced. However, by testing solely the 
mucus, Deheyn and Latz were able to trigger a glow without 
adding oxygen, which led them to speculate that the protein 
responsible for the light is a photoprotein — a protein that con-
tains oxygen within it. 

“When they studied the worm 50 years ago, the lack of oxy-
gen would have reduced the bioluminescence,” Latz said. “They 
used the full worm, indicating that they might have analyzed the 
internal flash instead of the mucus itself.”

The scientists said that isolating the particular protein respon-
sible will be a very difficult process. They will need to determine 
the amino-acid structure of the protein through column chroma-
tography and gel electrophoresis, a standard method for separat-
ing proteins based on their size and charge.

Latz said that a successful identification of the protein could 

▶ View of two small fireworms 
using bright-field microscopy. 
The worms are known for their 
bioluminescent mucus. 

▶ View of the fireworms using 
blue-excited fluorescence, showing 
green and yellow emission. 
Epifluorescence microscopy was 
used to take the above image.

▶ Green fluorescence, originated 
from epidermal cells spread over 
the fireworm’s body. This shows 
the worm glows internally, along 
with their secreted mucus.

▶ Fluorescence from the worm’s 
head was not associated with 
eyes (ey) or antenna (an).

▶ Green fluorescent organelles in 
epidermal cells of the fireworm, 
which can be seen glowing under 
the ocean’s surface.

▶ Secretion of green fluorescent 
mucus from the epidermal cells a 
few seconds later, which appears 
brighter as the mucus is released 
by the fireworm.

If you ﬁ nd yourself on the ﬁ rst ﬂ oor of Atkinson Hall anytime before June 10, tread lightly. Visiting professor Carlos 
Trilnick has constructed an indoor art exhibit 
— called the Anti-Personnel Mines Project, 
part of the gallery@calit2 — to raise awareness 
about the malicious use of landmines to kill 
enemy soldiers instead of targeting vehicles. 

To simulate a landmine, the interactive 
exhibit includes a series of sensors hidden 
beneath a bed of Astroturf. Each time someone 
steps on a sensor he or she detonates an 
explosion composed of sound effects and 
images including maps, statistics and phrases 
projected onto a wall. The sensitivity of each 
sensor varies from moment to moment so that 
the explosions remain as unpredictable as 
actual landmines. 

Trilnick hopes the exhibit will promote 
dialogue and encourage countries including 
the U.S. to sign the Ottawa Treaty, which bans 
the production and use of anti-personnel 

mines..

INFOCUS The Anti-Personnel Mines Project

W isdom — once the mere subject of flowery poetry and anecdotal religious 
teachings — has taken a giant leap 
into the realm of scientific brain 
imaging.

In a study published April 6, a 
team of UCSD researchers called 
for a scientific review of the neu-
robiology of wisdom, using lit-
erature on the subject as their 
starting point.

“We need to have some consen-
sus on the definition of wisdom,” 
said Dr. Dilip V. Jeste, professor 
of psychiatry and neurosciences at 
UCSD. Jeste is also the Estelle and 
Edgar Levi Chair in Aging and 
director of the Sam and Rose Stein 
Institute for Research on Aging.

The researchers decided to 
focus on individual traits that 
experts had decided were the 
ingredients to the widely accepted 
definition of wisdom —  such as 
pro-social attitudes, social deci-
sion-making, emotional homeo-
stasis, self-understanding, toler-
ance and acknowledgement of (as 
well as the ability to effectively 
deal with) uncertainty.

The researchers studied this 
concept of wisdom with neuro-
imaging, which uses small cam-

prove extremely useful to biomedi-
cine. 

“We hope to have it as a new tool 
for bioengineering and biomedical 
applications,” Latz said. “It is impor-
tant because light is a really easy sig-
nal to measure. It could be used to 
indicate changes in gene expression, 
ATP — a common energy source 
used by cells — and protein. In gen-
eral, there is tremendous interest in 
identifying and characterizing new 
bioluminescent chemicals, which is 
the reason why we are doing the 
project itself.”

Today, the protein responsible 
for the bioluminescence in jellyfish 
is a valuable tool used in biomedical 
research. 

According to Deheyn, over 
30,000 scientific papers have been 
published to date regarding this pro-
tein, discovered by Noble Prize lau-
reate Dr. Osamu Shimomura. The 
protein that Deheyn and Latz are 
trying to identify could possibly 
complement other existing fluores-

cent proteins. 
Joy Leilei Shih, who recently fin-

ished her master’s degree in marine 
biodiversity and conservation at 
UCSD, has been a 
research assistant 
in Deheyn’s lab 
for one year. She 
studies a different 
species, known as 
chaetopterus, or 
parchment worm. 

Like the fire-
worm, this worm 
releases biolumi-
nescent mucus and 
can glow internally. 
However, it does 
not swim to the 
surface of the water 
for spawning, as 
does the fireworm. 
Instead, its light is thought to deter 
predators and repel other animals 
looking for a dark place to hide.

Shih said identifying the protein 
responsible for bioluminescence in 
the fireworm’s mucus could be sig-

nificant in future medical research, 
and would build off previous stud-
ies. 

“In the long run, if we are able 
to identify, isolate 
and get a good 
u n d e r s t a n d i n g 
of this protein, 
it would be very 
helpful in the 
medical field, such 
as with things like 
cancer research,” 
Shih said. “The 
other thing that’s 
exciting is that 
previously it was 
thought that what 
makes it glow 
was an enzyme-
substrate reaction. 
But based on their 

experiments, we think that it is a 
photoprotein that creates the glow. 
It’s like thinking that the world is 
flat and then figuring out that it’s 
round.” 

Laura Enzor, who just received 

her master’s degree from the 
University of West Florida, also 
studies the parchment worm in 
Deheyn’s lab. 

“I think that the research is sig-
nificant simply because it’s interest-
ing to find out how animals work 
and why they do what they do,” 
Enzor said. “This is a really interest-
ing adaptation, and we should look 
at why they do it, how they do it and 
what helps them do it — namely the 
protein. Just learning about these 
animals is reward enough; you don’t 
necessarily have to be looking for a 
cure to something.”

Currently, Deheyn and Latz are 
still working to identify and isolate 
the protein in question. 

“The enzyme in the protein is 
not found anywhere else in the liv-
ing kingdom,” Latz said. “That is 
what’s special and also what makes 
it difficult to isolate. There is no 
framework for what it could be.”

eras to view brain activity through 
changes in blood flow or metabolic 
alteration on live subjects — some-
thing researchers were previously 
incapable of doing. The images 
helped Jeste and his team discover 
where certain traits could be found 
in the brain. For example, the pre-

located just beneath the forehead, 
controls several traits associated 
with wisdom — including emotion-
al regulation, decision-making and 
value relativism.

In the exploration of wisdom, 
researchers believe that isolating the 
location of certain traits in the brain 

may help in treating certain diseases 
or conditions in the future.

“The goal of the research is to 
find ways to help people,” Jeste 
said. “This research is important, 
because it has some relevance to 
some patients we see with things 
like dementia, a life-Alzheimer’s 
which consists of little memory loss, 
just a change in personality.”

The scientists’ research was sup-
ported in part by grants from the 
National Institute on Mental Health, 
the National Institute on Aging, the 
U.S. Health Resources and Services 
Administration, the UCSD Sam and 
Rose Stein Institute for Research 
on Aging and the Department 

of Veterans Affairs. Jeste said he 
believes their findings may even-
tually help a variety of patients, 
including the elderly and those with 
brain injuries and dementia. 

Jeste stressed that other less fac-
tual, more spiritual methods and 
beliefs about wisdom should not be 
completely neglected.

“This isn’t biology versus cul-
ture,” Jeste said. “Many things are 
both. Culture can influence the 
brain and effect behavior.” 

The study noted a strong cor-
relation between current definitions 
of wisdom, religion and philosophy 
and the definitions from ancient 
civilizations such as Greece, China 

and India. The Bhagavad Gita, an 
ancient Indian religious text, con-
tains a particularly relevant defini-
tion of wisdom: One must under-
stand the differences between the 
body — the field of activity — and 
the soul — the knower of the body.  

Jeste said he hopes his research 
will encourage the scientific com-
munity to take the concept of wis-
dom and other more abstract psy-
chological traits more seriously.

“Wisdom also has a scientific 
basis,” Jeste said. “We don’t do enough 
research on psychological traits.”

story of how love works. This course 
is about empowering students. They 
can have some control over the 
development of their relationships 
outside of the classroom.”

Like most psychology courses at 
UCSD, students are assigned read-
ing from a textbook for homework. 

Students have the opportunity 
to earn extra credit by marking the 
progress of their own relationships 
outside of the classroom. However, 
grades will be determined by the 
appropriate application of course 
material rather than its success, 
Epstein said. 

In order to participate in the 
real-life assignment, students are 
required to sign a waiver ensuring 
that the university will not be held 
responsible for consequences such 
as emotional heartbreak.

“The things we are learning are 
enhancing our relationships,” Jair 
said. “This is one class where we can 
actually apply the things we learn to 
the real world.”

In January, Epstein signed a 
production deal with the Wolper 
Organization to produce a reality 
TV series called “Making Love” — 
expected to air spring 2010 — in 
which couples across the nation will 
participate in relationship exercises 
and measure their progress.

“I want to give them the tools 
to strengthen their relationships,” 
Epstein said. “I want to show people 
out there that there are research-
based methods that are proven to 
be successful in improving relation-
ships.”

that the Red Sox and New York Yankees can’t 
always buy the AL East. The Rays showed 
that a well-developed farm system and key 
veteran acquisitions can equate to a World 
Series berth, even while the Evil Empire (now 
with a new Death Star!) tries to buy its way 
back to dominance. After spending slightly 
less than C.C. Sabathia’s weight in the off-
season, the Yanks continue to look weak due 
to a strange mix of egotistical all-stars and 
stunted up-and-comers. The Rays again have 
a chance to return to postseason play, though 
they no longer have the benefit of being over-
looked, and it will be interesting to see when 
the decision is made to call David Price to 
the big-league club. 

Nonetheless, this division 
should return to the Red Sox 
and their legion of annoying, 
arrogant and largely unedu-
cated fans. Even without 
Manny, the Red Sox have 
spent wisely and should get at 
least one surprise from their 
underpaid trio of newcomers 
in Brad Penny, Takashi Saito 
and John Smoltz.

AL Central
Probable division winner: 

Chicago White Sox.
Keeping hope alive: 

Minnesota Twins.
The AL Central is the least clear-cut in 

baseball. The Detroit Tigers continue to be 
better on paper than on the field. The Kansas 
City Royals will probably be better with Zach 
Grienke coming on strong, before settling 
into their customary fifth-place position. 
The Cleveland Indians were banking on 
Fausto Carmona, and he’s almost making 
Chien-Ming Wang look good. It appears that 
the White Sox and Twins, having played a 
one-game playoff last season, are destined 
to battle for the division crown once again 
this season. The Twins have the superior 
pitching, with Joe Nathan in the bullpen 
and the most complete starting rotation of 
any team — Scott Baker, Francisco Liriano, 
Kevin Slowey and the luxury of having pretty 
much anyone they call up being at least 
decent. Even when they sell off most of their 

players, the Twins seem to stay competi-
tive. However, the White Sox have by far the 
better offense and a rotation led by Mark 
Buehrle and John Danks that should be good 
for at least one more postseason appearance 
by Ozzie Guillen, before he inevitably gets 
fired for calling one of his players a cracker 
and challenging some fans in the stands to a 
knife fight. 

 
AL West

Probable division winner: Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim in Orange County Near 
the Hooters Off the Freeway.

Keeping Hope Alive: Seattle Mariners.
The Angels have dominated the AL West 

for much of the past seven 
years, and things look to 
remain the same head-
ing into the 2009 season. 
However, the team usu-
ally built on pitching and 
defense starts the season 
with three-fifths of its rota-
tion on the disabled list. 
Ervin Santana and John 
Lackey led the team to a 
2008 divisional champion-
ship, but have yet to pitch a 
game this year, while Kelvim 
Escobar is an unknown after 
missing last season. And it 
finally looks like Vladimir 

Guerrero’s actual age might be catching up 
with him. The unlikely Mariners are off to 
a hot start this season, behind the awesome 
one-two punch of Felix Hernandez and Eric 
Bedard. Of course, awesome is probably just 
an overstatement that deranged Mariners 
fans (like Cameron Tillisch) would use, while 
most reasonable individuals would refer to 
the tandem as somewhere between solid and 
fluky. 

New manager Don Wakamatsu’s small-ball 
theory has also paid off early for the Mariners, 
who presently are sitting pretty atop the AL 
West with an impressive 11-6 record. While 
guys like Endy Chavez and Jarrod Washburn 
will probably not continue to produce at their 
early-season levels, Seattle remains the divi-
sion’s the best shot at challenging an Angels 
team that has been decimated by injury and 
tragedy.

▶ AMERICAN LEAGUE, MYVT�WHNL���

last home meet of the season, the Tritons 
performed admirably against stiff competi-
tion at the UCSD Triton Invitational on April 
24. The competition featured athletes from 
Division-I programs in the Pac-10, Big-12 and 
Southeastern Conference. 

The 4x100 meter relay team, consist-
ing of junior Christine Merrill, senior Katie 
Skorupa, sophomore Kelly Fogarty and senior 
Laiah Blue led the women’s team. The four 
sprinters finished in 46.50 seconds to set a 
new record for UCSD and record the seventh 
fastest time nationally in Division II this 
season. 

Merrill also competed in the 100-meter 
hurdles and 400-meter hurdles as one of the 
few Tritons to participate in three events. She 
placed third in the 100-meter event and won 
the 400-meter hurdles — an event in which 
she is ranked third nationally.

Merrill’s strong races at the Triton 
Invitational come at a good time in the sea-
son. 

“This helps me gain momentum for con-
ference,” she said. “It’s really exciting because 
our 4x100 [team] ran so well and we can still 
improve. There are a lot of school records 
on the team this year. Everyone pushes each 
other, and if one person does well it helps 
everyone else do well.”

Skorupa, who ran the second leg in the 
4x100 relay, also competed in the 200-meter 
dash. She recorded a time of 25.70, which was 
good for third place in the race and 10th fast-
est in school history.

Junior thrower Danielle Thu also per-
formed well for the Tritons, breaking her own 
school record in the hammer throw by an 
inch, with a mark of 189’6’’. Thu placed sixth 
in an event featuring a former Olympian and 
Division-I champion. Fellow thrower sopho-
more Theresa Richards placed fifth in the 
javelin throw, with a mark of 132’01”, her 
personal best. 

On the men’s side, junior hurdler Leon 

Baham, junior thrower Fred Cook and fresh-
man thrower Nick Howe led with a trio of 
NCAA provisional qualifying marks. 

Howe placed sixth overall in the javelin 
throw with a mark of 193’10”, good for second 
in school history.

“This is really extraordinary because the 
javelin throw is an event that usually takes 
a while to develop,” Salerno said of Howe’s 
immediate success.

Baham had a strong showing in the 400-
meter hurdles, placing fourth with a time of 
53.10.

In a meet known for the quality of its 
throwing events, Cook placed 17th with a 
mark of 181’ in the hammer throw.

Junior Casey Ryan had a strong perfor-
mance in the high jump, clearing 6’10.75” 
to place third overall. Ryan had some of the 
stiffest competition in the meet, and fin-
ished behind only University of Nebraska’s 
Paul Hamilton and University of Tennessee’s 
Brenard Wilson. 

Despite the team’s success this season, 
Salerno stressed that conference will not be 
easy.

“We have possibly one of the toughest con-
ferences in Division II,” he said. “We almost 
need the Division I meets to get ready for a 
conference like ours.”

While not all of the team will move on to 
conference, Salerno emphasized the impor-
tance of every athlete.

“Everyone who’s out there laying it on 
the line has a role in getting other people to 
nationals,” he said. “That’s something that I 
think has been a huge thing for us — the level 
of commitment that we’ve seen in the program 
has grown immensely.” 

The Tritons will begin conference cham-
pionships on April 30 in Chico, where the 
Triton women will attempt to capture their 
fifth straight title.

seven runners in the loss. The 
Coyotes scored two runs in the 
second inning, which proved to be 
enough for them as the Tritons only 
managed to drive in one run on a 
sacrifice fly from junior shortstop 
Vance Albitz.

UCSD answered back in the sec-
ond game, using a nine-run eighth 
inning to overcome the Coyotes. 
Already holding a 4-0 lead, the 
Tritons led off the eighth inning 
with a double from senior second 
baseman Garrett Imeson. Redshirt 
junior Brendon Gregorich and Tim 
Mort added back-to-back doubles to 
plate the first two runs of the rally. 
Ten batters and seven runs later, the 
Tritons took a 13-0 lead into the 
ninth.

Riding a huge wave of momen-
tum, the Tritons came home to 
face the Coyotes in a doubleheader 
on Saturday. This time, the lineup 
didn’t wait as long to put up a 
crooked number, following up a solo 
homer from junior catcher Kellen 
Lee in the second inning with five 
scores in the third. Cantele’s double 
was the Tritons’ biggest hit of the 
inning, scoring two in the rally.

Lee added another solo shot 
and Cantele homered in the game 
en route to a 10-4 UCSD victory. 
Cantele’s home run was the 53rd of 
his career, tying the record for home 
runs as a Triton.

UCSD capped off the CSUSB 
series with a little more history 
in the final game. Senior starting 
pitcher Trevor Decker earned his 
26th career victory, making him the 
Tritons’ all-time wins leader. 

The victory did not come easily, 
however, as UCSD spent most of the 
game holding on to a slim 2-1 lead. 
After Decker pitched his last inning, 

the Tritons finally broke the game 
open in the bottom of the fifth with 
three runs.

The inning started with a blast 
off the bat of Nick Burke, which 
was tracked down and caught in 
right centerfield, robbing the senior 
outfielder of a double. Albitz came 
up to bat with one out and lined 
a ball to first base. But the Coyote 
first baseman couldn’t come up with 
the hard hit ball, earning Albitz 
a single to start the Triton rally. 
After a passed ball allowed Albitz 
to advance to second base, CSUSB 
intentionally walked Cantele, giving 
the Tritons two runners with two 
outs. Gregorich, UCSD’s next batter, 
worked the count to 3-1 before hit-
ting a towering homer to left field, 
giving the Tritons a 5-1 lead.

The Coyotes answered back with 
two runs in the top of the second, 
but the Tritons weren’t done scor-
ing yet. After Mort singled to start 
the inning, junior outfielder Robert 
Sedin’s helmet was grazed by a pitch, 
allowing him to take first base. 
Three batters later, Albitz drove in a 
run with a single to centerfield and 
Sedin scored on a wild pitch, giving 
the Tritons a 7-3 lead. The Coyotes 
rallied in the seventh, but only man-
aged one run, giving Decker and the 
Tritons a big win. 

The Tritons (30-11, 24-8 CCAA) 
have now clinched a playoff berth 
and sit atop the conference stand-
ings, two games ahead of second-
place Sonoma State University. 
UCSD will face sixth-place Cal Poly 
Pomona in a home and home series 
April 30 through May 2 before 
the CCAA Tournament in Palm 
Springs.

▶ BASEBALL, MYVT�WHNL���
out of the postseason on a last-min-
ute change, Wydra was not exactly 
surprised.

“We’ve been looking for a fourth 
and fifth guy all year long,” he said. 
“None of the other guys were able 
to go low enough all season. To be 
honest, [the new changes] are prob-
ably a better indicator.”

With the team eliminated from 
postseason contention, UCSD 
claimed three of four individual 
qualifying spots for the NCAA 
Regional taking place May 4 through 
May 6. 

Sophomore Keith Okasaki, 
junior Raj Samra and Olsen will 
represent UCSD at the Wilderness 
Ridge Golf Club in Lincoln, Neb. 
The trio has consistently been the 
top competitors on the team’s ros-
ter. 

Individual qualifiers are select-
ed from teams that did not advance 
to the NCAA Regional based on 
their recent performance as well 
as their overall play throughout 
the regular season competitions. 
According to Wydra, Olsen was 
most likely selected for regionals 
due to his solid finishes at the last 
two tournaments of the season, 
while Okasaki and Samra earned 
spots based on consistency in com-
petition play over the entire season.  

Okasaki is coming off a tie 
for eighth place at the CCAA 
Championships, where he fired a 
one over par 217. The finish is his 
best since finishing second at the 
St. Edward’s Invitational in Texas 
Feb. 24 and 25. 

The Sacramento native leads the 
Tritons with a 74.1 scoring average 
and has been one of the more con-
sistent players during the regular 
season. This is his first trip to the 
postseason.

Since transferring from Cypress 
College this year, Samra has estab-

lished himself as a leader for the 
Triton squad. He led his junior 
college team to a conference cham-
pionship in his sophomore season 
and is no stranger to postseason 
play.

Described by Wydra as a steady 
player who doesn’t get flustered, 
Samra has proved worthy of the 
praise, posting four top-15 finish-
es throughout the year — his best 
a fourth place at the Point Loma 
Invitational March 2 and 3. But 
since then, Samra has struggled to 

find his rhythm during competitive 
play and is coming off his lowest 
finish of the season in the confer-
ence championship. 

“Raj is not in bad shape,” Wydra 
said. “I think he had one of his 
worst tournaments of the year, but 
based on his play all season, he was 
selected. His stroke average is way, 
way, way good enough to qualify for 
the national championships.”

Olsen qualified for the NCAA 
Regional for the second straight year 
with a consistent 75-75-72 at the 
CCAA Championship. After finish-
ing T-84 at the GCU/Thunderbird 
Invitational, Olsen posted a pair of 
top-25 finishes, including his 19th-
place finish at last week’s champion-

ships.
“I think Billy really impressed 

the selection committee with his 
play this past week,” Wydra said. 
“He has really come on strong after 
struggling early on this season.”

The Tritons haven’t had an 
individual qualify for the NCAA 
National Championship since 1980, 
Wydra’s first year as head coach. 
That year, Bruce Nakamura finished 
second in the nation.

Okasaki, Samra and Olsen will 
try and change that in the coming 
weeks. The NCAA Regional will 
feature three rounds spread over 
three days — a change in format 
from regular collegiate play which 
features 36 holes the first day and 
18 the second. 

The top 10 teams from both 
the West and Midwest Regions will 
be competing for five spots in the 
NCAA National Championships. 
All individuals not on the five quali-
fying teams will compete for a single 
individual spot.

Wydra believes that his three 
golfers have a good chance of being 
that lone individual if they’re on top 
of their game.

“The people who play the best 
will likely be on advancing teams, 
which is good,” he said. 

That leaves nearly 80 individu-
als vying for only one spot, forcing 
Okasaki, Samra or Olsen to post a 
Nakamura-like run to advance. But 
the difficulty of Wilderness Ridge 
Golf Club will play into the hands 
of the Triton golfers, according to 
Wydra.

“The fact that it’s a tough course 
bodes well for us,” Wydra said. “We 
specialize in tough courses by play-
ing the harder courses in town and 
in the tournaments we choose to 
play.”

BASEBALL — The No. 6 Tritons 
came out of Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on April 18 with their first-
place lead in the conference stand-
ings cut in half after dropping a 
doubleheader to the fourth-place 
Toros.

“It was a tough day because they 
seemed to have a lot of momentum 

and we struggled to get it back,” 
senior third baseman Josh Tanner 
said. “We weren’t as successful with 
our offensive approach as we usually 
are and their pitchers took advan-
tage.”

Following the series, UCSD trav-
eled to Cal State San Bernardino 
hoping to get back on the winning 
track.

“We need to get back to doing 
what we do best,” senior first base-
man Matt Cantele said before the 
series with the Coyotes. “We need 
to play great defense, pound the 
strike zone and have quality plate 
appearances. If we do that then the 
winning and everything else will fall 
in place.”

But UCSD fell 4-1 to the Coyotes, 

losing its third straight contest, with 
the offense falling flat in the open-
ing match. Following the loss, the 
Tritons responded with a 13-1 bash-
ing of Cal State San Bernardino, 
breaking out of their mini-slump in 
a big way and clinching a California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
playoff spot at the same time.

The Tritons returned to Triton 
Baseball Stadium and extended 
their home winning streak to 14 
games with two wins in a double-
header on April 25.

In the first game of the home 
and home series on April 23 in 
San Bernardino, the Tritons put 
together seven hits but stranded

Watching an early-sea-son game between the defending American 
League West Champion Angels 
and the defending AL last-place 
Mariners provides an interesting 
preview of the opening month of 
the Major League Baseball season 
— even when your team has Russell 
Branyan hitting in the three-spot 

and the guy who ate Ken Griffey 
Jr. hitting before him, there’s still 
hope that this could be the year. 
Thus, at this early-season junction, 
it’s worth taking a division-by-divi-
sion look at those teams that, one 
month in, can keep hope alive and 
those teams that will probably end 
up winning the division. Starting 
with the AL and continuing with a 
National League preview next week, 
the mission is to batter everyone 
over the head with baseball articles 
in hopes of convincing people that 
this is not a boring sport, or at least 
that it’s almost as exciting as watch-
ing seven hours of the NFL draft.

TRACK & FIELD — Even while resting during the 
week before conference championships, the Triton track 
and field squad managed to place more athletes in the 
school’s record books.

With conference coming up this week, the coaches 
decided to sit many of the athletes at the invitational in 
order to put forth the team’s best effort when the races 
count the most.

“We leave on Wednesday for conference, and some of 
the athletes compete as early as Thursday,” head coach

That’s how close the UCSD 
men’s golf team was to qualifying 
for the NCAA Division-II Regional 
Championship.

The Tritons entered last week’s 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship believ-

berth in regionals. But everything 
changed during the coach’s meeting 
the day before competition, when 
head coach Mike Wydra learned his 
team would need a victory to make

pressure on us,” senior Billy Olsen 
said. “It was a tough thing to deal 
with, and it was always in the back

sixth-place finish at the CCAA 
Championships, finishing behind

DANIEL CADDELL/GUARDIAN
After posting strong finishes at the Triton Invitational, UCSD will compete in the 
conference championships April 30 through May 2. The Tritons fared well in the 
competition last season — the women placed first while the men finished third.

The first-place Tritons 
took three out of four 
games against the Coyotes 
last weekend, securing a 
spot in the postseason.
