AS Considers 
'Coffee Hut 
Collective' 

An official organizational 
outline of the proposed 
restaurant to be installed inthe 
now partly empty Coffee Hut 
was presented and unanimou-
sly approved at last night's AS 
Council meeting. 

Food Co-op workers 
responsible for the establish-
ment of this restaurant, 
tentatively called the "Coffee 
Hut Collective," said they 
hope to provide another 
alternative (the Food Co-op is 
an existing one) to the "highly ' 
processed, dubiously 
nutritious, energy intensive 
and relatively expensive food 
presently available on 
campus. 

As the service will be a 
collective, no surplus profit will 
be made from its selling of 
food, Co-op 'representatives 
said last night. "Instead," they 
said, "the price of food sold 
shaH be just adequate to cover 
the cost of food, labor to 
prepare ' and sell it, and 
operating expenses of th 
Coffee Hut." 

Management of the 
restaurant will be handled by 
the workers, one AS 
represenative, one Student 
Center Board representa live 
and one Student Affinnative 
Action Committee represen-
tative. Supplementing this 
group wiH be volunteer 
workers who cannot d~vote 
large amounts of time and 
energy to the collective. 

Proposed hours of 
operation for the Collective are 
8:30 am to 2:30 pm.

yogurt, fruit and omelettes will

Berman is backed by only 27 of the 50 Democratic

Most McCarthy upporters and all Assembly Republicans

Vasconcellos has consistently cast the one vote for McCarthy 
in the daily caucus meeting, refusing to abstain with other 
McCarthy supporters or switch to the Berman camp. 

"I am close to both men personally and I think each would 
make a fine Speaker," said Vasconcellos. 

His personal position, as reflected in the vote for McCarthy, is 
that "McCarthy has been the speaker and he's been a good 
speaker, and there is no reason to disposess him of his position." 

Vasconcellos feels that Berman was willing to accept him as 
mediator because he has been open and wimng to listen.

. Carter Asks. Congress 
For Funds to Reinstate 
Draft Registration 

From the Auociated Pre. 
WASHINGTON - Preaident Carter called for reinJlitution 

of registration for the draft in his State of the Union addre..lut 
night. --

Citing Soviet aggresaion in Afghanistan a. an "assault on the 
vital interest of the United States," Carter said he will ask 
congress to help meet that asaault by appropriating funds for 
reviving the Selective Service System. 

Although he said he is certain that the current aD-VOu. ..... 
armed forces can handle the nation'. defense needs, Carter said 
he would send legislation and budget prc;».POsaIs to Congress to 
revitalize the Selective Service Sy.tem ' 10 that We can bepI 
registration and then meet future mobilization need. rapidly if 
they arise." 

All branches of the US mititary fell short of recruibnent goals 
during the past year for the fir.t time since the draft endect in 
1973. But Pentagon official. say the Defense Department sent 
no recommendation for the renewal of registration. 

In the past, the White House has said Carter has authority to 
require registration without congresaionaJ action. But he does 
not have authority . to institute a draft unilaterally. 

Earlier this month, the Selective Service sy.tem estimated it 
would cost from $16 million to $47 malion a year to reinstate 
draft registration. 

Although Carter did mention registering women for the draft, 
less than a year ago he said that if registration became necessary 
"it would probably be inevitable we would register both" men 
and women. 

"Draft-age" is currently defined as men 18-26. 
Promising to "further strengthenpotitical and military ties with 

other nations" around the Persian Gulf, Carter said: 'We believe 
that there are no irreconcilable differences between us and any 
Islamic people. We respect the faith of Islam, .RCI.,. readytD 

c~perate with all Moslem countries." 
Noting that "the Moslem world is especially and justifiably 

outraged" by Soviet actions in Afghanistan, Carter added: 
"Verbal condemnation is not enough. The Soviet Union must 
pay a concrete price for their aggression ... The Soviet Union 
must realize that his decision to use military force in Afghanistan 
will be costly to every political and economic relationship it

A UCSD graduate, Gail 
Arrigo. was deported from 
Taiwan Dec. 15 al part of a 
musive crackdown on the 
democratic and human rights 
movement by the Nationalist 
ClJineae Goverament (KMT). 
Her husband. Shih Ming Teh 
(a Taiwan citizen) is one of as 
many as 500 people who have 
been arrested .mce Dec. 13 
and are being charged with

The Nationaliat Chinese 
Government fled to Taiwan in 
1949. Because no general 
elections have been held since 
then, the government is 
literally dying off. The KMT, 
parading the myth that they 
still represent all of China and 
will retake the mainland, has 
been able to continue the 30 
years of martial law and 
IUppress the representation of 
the native Tai'wanese (85 
percent of the population). 

On Dec. 13, the KMT 
began arresting Formosa 
magazine workers and aU 
democratic leaders. These 
included members of the 
legislature , lawyers, promi. 
nent authors, medical 
personnel , women's rights 
advocates and candidates for 
the 1978 electiona. Five days 
later the KMT announced that 
elections will be resumed at an 
appropriate time. The arrests 
are still continuing daily as 
authorities try to silence aU 
criticism. Ministers and 
officials of the Presbyterian 
Church, which has been vocal 
on human rights, have a110 
been arrested or have simply 
di.appeared. 

To James Van Scoyoc (Daily Guardian, Jan. 16) who feels 
compelled to express the views of the majority, I think you've 
missed the point. The issue ' is not whether we should have a 
vegetarian restaurant at the now defunct Coffee Hut , but 
whether it should continue to be an on·campus eating facility . 

At this poinl, the nicest setting for congregating, eating and 
being comfortable amid the eucalyptus is abandoned and 
inaccessible to the public . . As it stands, it could just become a 
part of that exclusive, scarcely approachable student madness 
(bureaucracy), which is only infiltrated by a select few initiates 
(i.e., The Daily Guardian and the ASUCSD). Wouldn't that be 
an unfortunate loss of what was once an important facility - if 
not a tradition - to the southern campus of UCSD? .

Perhaps Future Foods did fail, but look at it now. Had it not 
started as an eating facility of some sort, it is dubious that Walk's

which has demonstrated considerable ambition and success, 
make a go of continuing to offer the Coffee Hut to all of us.

I opened the driver'. door. squeezed inside and, 
pu.hing aside a Iampahade that had wandered a bit 
too far to the left, .parked the eniJIe to life. The

and thought for awhile. I remember standing 
motionle.I, gazing off into the future, at the next few 
days. at the coming maes. I remember being happy 
at that moment and liking the world very much. I 
remember smiling. 

Still smiling, I turned back to my duties. The 
'weather wal cool and sunless, typical Colorado 
weather for that sea.on. I had checked the forecast 
and was hoping that they had prophesied correctly, 
that as I drove south into New Mexico the sky would 
clear and warm winds would push the cold away. 

I was leaving Ft. Collins. leaving friends and ' 
lovers, leaving school, and leaving security in the 
place where it always thrives best - in the palt. An 
aggressive but vulnerable hurtle into the future. The 
unknown future . 

I was trading security and boredom for inBecurity 
and adventure because I felt that I had no other 
choice. I aee~ to be the beat of all pouible actions. 
I had the usual generalities in mind - change of 
pace, new friends and so on - but the specifics 
eluded me. I had not yet realized that they always 
would. 

After completing the final oil·checking and rope· 

tightening, I took out my frayed and greased and 
ketchupeO road map 01 the United States and .tudied 
it careluU)l. Down to New Mexico, on a quick -jog 
over into Texas, on west to Arizona and then, if my 
overencwnbered Colorado Cruiler made it that far,

NAACP: Blacks Still 
Lack Politic.al Clout 

NEW YORK - The NAACP saysBlacks help elect many 
politicians, yet still lack political clout. One problem is that 
politicians don't know what Blacks want them to do. 

"We've needed something that will get their attention," says 
Joseph Madison director of voter education for the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 

A new commercial polling organization, Data Black Public 
Opinion Polls. proPOSp.s to do just that. On Tuesday, it released 
a presidential preference poll of 1.146 'Blacks that showed 
President Carter trailing Sen. Edwarcl Kennetiy by 49 p.ercent to ' 
31percent among registered black Democrats. , 

The figures are almost a reversal of the latest CBS· New York 
Times poll , taken early in January, which showed that nationally ' 
Democrats preferred Carter by a 44;percent to 34.percent 
margin. 

Seventy percent of the Blacks contacted identified themsdves 
as Democrats. The random' survey, which pollsters said has a 
sampling error of slightly more than 3 percent, was taken by 
telephone between Nov. 29, 1979, and Jan. 2, 1980. 

Data Black was formed to correct what the founders say are 
inadequacies of present national polling organizations when they 
tum toBlacks. 

Chief among those inadequacies. according to one of Data 
Black's founders, psycholog!st Kenneth Clark , is the number of 

Blacks in a typical sample. The Gallup Poll can draw accurate 
conclusions about national opinion on the basis of 1,500 
interviews. But pollsters may talk to only 140Blacks .. a number 
at which Black opinions can be off either way by at least 10 
percentasze points. 

And it is impossible, within that already small group, to draw 
any conclUSions on opimons of even smaller groups, such as 
coDege-educated Blacks, he says. 

The questions the national pollsters do ask Blacks present 
another problem. 

"They used to ask questions like 'What do you people want?' 
or 'Who are your leaders?'" says Clark. "AI. if Blacks were 
Martians." 

But, he adds, ordinary polls can't get significant data for more 
specific questions, since their sample is so small. 

US 'Alone in World' 
On Olympic Boycott 

WASHINGTON - The head of the US Olympic Committee 
said yesterday the Carter administration's suggested boycott of 
the 1980 SlD11mer Olympic Games !n MOicow is an ill·advised, 
go.it·a1one stance that is unpopular around the world. 

Te.tifying before the HOUle Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Olympic committee President Robert J. Kane asserted, "We're 
out there alone, swaying in the wind." r· . 

Kane was testifying on a House resolution aimed at giv!Jl8 
congreaaional support to President Carter'a. threat of a US 
boycott of the Olympic Games. . . "'! , l' 

Carter 'said Sunday he will ask U:S, athletes to boyc~ th~ • 
Olympics if by Feb. 20 the Ruisian troops still ar~ in ::: 
Afghanistan and the International Olympic Committee hal 
refused Carter's request to move. po.tpone or cancel the Gamel. 

The Carter administration has been advised ·that it has no 
legal authority to bar participation in the Games by US a~letes, 
and resolutions proposed in Congreu would not have the force 
of law. 

The House resolution would urge the US Olympit Committee 
to honor Carter's request. 

"The Soviet invasion endangers independent countries 
neighboring Afghanistan and endangers access to a major 
source of the world's oa supplies," the relOlution says. 

"So," it adds, "the security of the United States, of the region 
encompassing Afghanistan and of the entire world is 
threatened. " 
, Kane testified that he does not oppose Carter's idea of 
exploring a transfer 01 the Games from' Moscow. 

A proposal to delay the Games until 1981 and take them out 
of Moscow is one option the US Olympics Commit.tee's 
executive board wiD consider at a meeting this weekend in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., he said . 

But Kane allO said that no country the committee hal 
contacted has agreed to go so far as to boycott the MOIcow 
Olympic. this summer . 

He said many of theBe countries. such a. Great Britain and 
Australia, favor transferring the Games out of Moscow. Kane 
said none of the other. checked hal gone 10 far 81 to sugge.t a 
boycott . 

And, he said. "I would deplore cancding the Game. because I 
don't think they would eV&' get atarted qain."

Carter calls for the Draft

values." 

In a key declaration, the President said: 
"Any attempt by any outside force to gain 
control of the Persian Gulf region will be 
regarded as an assault on the vital interests of 
the United States. It will be repelled by use of 
any means neceaaary, including military force ." 

Carter did urge US·Soviet cooperation on 
one front, however, when he said voluntary 
observance of constraints imposed by the terms 
of the two strategic arms ~mitation treaties ._ 
including the SALT II treaty that he withdrew 
from Senate consideration after Soviet forces 
entered Afghanistan -- "will be in the best 
intere.t of both countries and will help to 

. preeerve world peace ." 
Carter promiaed that the effort to control 

nudear weapons "wjll not be .abandoned," 
saying thai "preventing nuclear war is the 
foremost responsibility of the two 
superpowers." 

Although Carter warned Iran again that "if 
the American hostage •. are harmed, a sev~re 
price will be paid," he said ,he .wiD try "to 

I j" 

per.uade the Iranian leaders that the real 
danger to their . nation lies to the north from 
Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and that the 
unwarranted Iranian quarrel with us hampers 
their response to this greater danger. " 

Carter said, "The Soviet Union is now 
attempting to conso~date a strategic position 
that poses a grave threat to the free movement 
of Middle East oil." 

ASlierting that the situation "demands 
careful thought, steady nerves and resolute 
action," he called for "collective efforts to meet 
this new threat" by all nations "who rely on oil 
from the Middle East and ar, concerned with 
global peace and stability." . 

In a related development, an Associated 
Preas·NBC News Poll indicated that public 
support for spending more on US defense and 
the military has jumped to the highest level in a 
decade as the crises continue in Iran and 
Afghanistan. 

Those polled said the objective of increased 
defense spending would be to gain military 
superiority over the Soviet Union.

sense that John is legitimately concerned about 
the deep divisions this is causing in the caucus." 

"I would love to have the matter resolved so 
, we can proceed in the business of being human 

beings,' explained Vasconcellos. 

Last year, he successfully ended the impasse 
surrounding abortions, which one of his aides 
called "the most sensitive political problem 
legislatures have to deal with." 

The focus of the wrangle within the caucus is 
McCarthy' 8 handling of party funds . 

The McCarthy camp perceives 
Vasconcellos as a conciliator and someone who 
can maint&in a high degree of objectivity. 

Berman contends McCarthy has personal 
desigrts on a war chest raised for use by 
Assemblymen. McCarthy is considered a likely 
candidate for higher office in 1981 or 1982. 

Vasconcellos, who once founded an 
organization called Self-Determination to 
"humanize _ politics," preaches openness and 
honesty. He IS highly respectea 10 toe 
legislature for his integrity. 

Sources from both sides agree that the very 
fact Vasconcellos was chosen as mediator is 
both a tribute and a boost to his personal 
stature.

DES Use May Hav~ 
Hurt . Grandchildren 

By Monica Gieben 
Staff Writer 

Females ' exposed to the 
synthetic hormone DES at 
birth may grow up to be more 
~kely to deliver premature or 
stillborn babies, a study here 
led by Dr. Larry Cousins 
suggests. . 

During the 1940s through 
the early 1970s, DES, or 
diethly~tibestrol, was taken by 

a number of pregnant women 
to prevent miscarriages or 
bleeding during pregnancy. 
Around 1971, doctors 
discovered that, although DES 
was supposed to ensure "safe 
pregnancies," it also caused 
the development of an unusual 
form of vaginal cancer in DES 
daughters. About two million 
women were in the fetal stage 
when their mothers unknow-
ingly took the estrogen. 

Although this effect has 
been known for years, no 
studies were conducted until 
now to examine the effects of 
DES on the second 
generation, the DES 
daughters ' offspring. 

The UCSD study monitored 
a group of women who had 
been exposed to DES and their 
pregnancy outcomes . They 
found that DES daughters 

appear much more likely to 
experience problems during 
pregnancies than women not 
exposed to DES . Such 
problems include the delivery 
of premature babi~s, stillborn 
infants and perinatal deaths-
deaths close to the time of birth 
- of their offspring. 

Cousins explains, "What 
we wanted to do was to look at 
the pregnancy outcome of 
women who had been exposed 
to DES and compare them to a 
comparable group of women 
who had no DES exposure 
history." 

Seventy-one women who 
had been exposed to DES 
were matched with 69 control 
women of similar age, race, 
marital status, medical history 
and pregnancy problems, so 
that significant differences 
between the two groups "ther 
than DES exposure were 
eliminated. 

The results of the study 
indicated that there were no 
problems present in either 
group in terms of fertility or 
earlLpregnancy stages. 

"There didn't appear to be 
any difference in fertility. The 
DES women were just as able 
to get pregnant. There was no 
difference between the two 
groups in terms of early 
pregnancy problems such as 
spontaneous miscarriages or 
tubal pregnancies ," Cousins 
explained. 

However, when comparing

Recovery Room Expanding 
By Bill Knowlet 

University Hospital has 
nearly completed its latest 
expansion project, which, at a 
cost of $1 million, will provide 
patients with more sophisticat-
ed recovery room care. 

The expansion project, 
underway since the fall of 
1978, was funded by a 1972 
State Health Sciences Bond. 
The project was undertaken, 
because, "there were not 
enough beds, medical gases or 
outlets in the recovery room," 
Smith says. 

The new recovery room has 
17 beds with gas availability, 
and each patient can be 

viewed from a central area. In 
addition, says Smith, a special 
isolation area for infectious 
patients who are recovering 
from surgery has been added. 

According to Pat Jacoby, 
spokesperson for the Patient 
Information Department of the 
hospital , the new recovery 
room also has superior 
monitoring devices used to 
constantly register a patient's 
vital signs. 

In addition to the new 
recovery room, a tenth 
operating room was built to 
handle an increasing volume 
of surgeries. The new 
operating room is "equipped 

with more modern equipment, 
is centrally located and has the 
immediate availabitity of the 
anesthesiology staff next 
door," Smith says. 

"Having the anesthesiology 
offices adjacent to the 
recovery and operating rooms 
is one of the greatest 
advantages of the project," 
Smith says, explaining that 
each room can have constant 
supervision by an anesthesiol-
ogy staff physician. 

This renovation project is 
just one of 28 that have been 
completed in the past five 
years at the hospital.

Live Rust 
Neil Young and Crazy

At first consideration, the 

ide of a second live Neil Young

though, this Iwo-record set's

The treatmenl J{iven to 

"Hey Hey, My My (Inlo The

youth and age in rock, is even 
brawnier than on his 1a.1 
album, a calculatedly 
primitive exercise in electric 
guitar mania.

Heat of .the Night 
Pat Benatar - In The Heat 

Of The Night (Chrysalis) 
With the current spate of 

female rocker debuts (Carolyn 
Mas, Ellen Shipley and Foley) 
continuing with no end in sight, 
Benatar's firsl album runs the 
risk of being lost in the crowd. 
For the moment at leasl, she's 
getting more attention than her 
peers - "Heartbreaker" is 
receiving airplay, though it's 

far from the best track on the 
album_ 

Actually , In The Heat Of 
The Night is a mixed bag of 
various vocal and arrangmenl 
styles, only partially a success. 
Benatar shows up best on her 
self-penned "My Clone Sleeps

leaps from genteel purring to 
sas.y ydping with delightful 
ease.

exactly how they are linked is 
IIiII unclear. 

Cousins points out that it 

haa been well known for 
decades that abnormalitiea in 
a woman'. uterine contour 
may often lead to premature 
labor. 

"It appear. that women who 

were DES daughters have a 
high incidence of uterine 
abnormalitie.," perhaps 
explaining part of the 
unknown link, he says. 

Another possibility cited by 
Cousins concerns the 
relationship between the 
function of the cervix (mouth 
of the uterus) during 
pregnancy and the change in 
its anatomy found in DES

"Functionally, it serves to

DES exposure then that might

and I remember looking around, thinking: 

'"The reat of my life can be like this desert - the way it should 
be, waa meant to be. In hannony with nature, at peace with

"Yes," I remember thinking, "I'll make it be like that." 
I spent the night in the open, under a twinkling dome, alone, 

listening to the sounds of the nocturnal desert - lizards

Why Change a Good

Continued from pafe 6 All other songs on the

Fabulous Poodles . J'hink that's definitely not for the 
Pink (Epic) 

This all·for-Iaughs rock 
band from Merry Old England 
is tacky and silly and proud of 
it. the Fab Poo's second LP, 
while not a significant artistic 
advance from their first, 
combines British whimsy with 
iIatout bad taste to comedic 
effect. . 

The best tracks include 
"Cossack Cowboy" and 
"Anna Rexia," the sort of 
tunes you'd find on a Monty 
Python movie soundtrack. As 
intentionally cute and trivial 
music, Think Pink works.

Marianne Faithful - Broken 

English (Island) 
Critics have been praising 

this record to the skies 
recently, and with good reason 
- Faithfull's comeback try is 
a vehement kick in the groin to 
staid rock, an uncompromis-
ingly heartfelt effort. From the 
simmering gloom of "Guilt" to 
the controlled hysteria of "The 
Ballad of Lucy Jordan, " 
Faithfull's hoarse singing 
creates a sustained mood of 
passion and drama.

Government 
Repression 
In Taiwan 

Continued from PCJIe ~ 
Dec. 20, 1979, Congressman 
Jim Leach of Iowa states: 

"Above all, it is time that the 
ruling KMT authorities in 
Taiwan recognize that the 
continued denial to the 
majority of the island's 
population of the right to 
participate fully in their own 
political system is likely to lead 
to further demonstrations and 
political instability." 

What has happened in 
Taiwan in the past 1 0 days is 
worthy of careful attention in 
the Congress. Last March, 
when the Congress passed the 
Taiwan Relations Act, it 
asserted in a provision that 
" the preservation and 
enhancement of the human 
rights of all the people on 
Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed 
as objectives of the United 
States."
