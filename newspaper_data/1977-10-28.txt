Divergent issues mark race 
District C incumbent challenged 

by Mark SWIer 
In cortrut to the other San 

Diego Board 01 Education race 
(Triton 'l1mes, Oct. 26), the battle 
for the Dlstrict C board seat baa 
been marked by both a sharp 
divergence on the issues and 
personal animosity between 
candidates Julie Fisher and 
Yvonne Larsen. 

The race bet .... Filber aDd 
Larsen-which will be decided 
during the Nov. 8 general elections-
is one between an Incumbent, 
Fisher, who has often been a lorte 
voice on the board on many issues, 
and challenger, Larsen, who has 
called for Wlity among school 
trustees. 

Larsen, a 52-year old 
homemaker, said Fisher, is "a tool 
of Teacher Association leader-
ship. " 

Fisher, 44, said her association 
with teachers ian't nearly as close 
as Larsen's ties with builders of 
windowless schools (which Ftsher 
opposes). 

Speodla& UmJt 
Fisher called for a limit on 

campaign spending of $17,000, 
which, she says, is the maximum 
spent by one school board can-
didate in past campaigns. Larsen 
refused, saying that most of her 
support comes frem the ''parents 
and grandparents of school 
children. " 

The two candidates major issue 
differences concern the scbool 

Theatre seats 
for half-price 

UCSD people can now see movies 
at area Mann Theatres for half-
price. 

Area MaM representatives have 
made a deal with the campus box 
office, under which tJCSD 
students, faculty, administrators 
and staff members can purchase .... 
exchange tickets at the box office 
[or $1.75. 

The exchange tickets can then be 
taken to the box office at any area 
Mann theatre and traded for an 
admission ticket. 

According to a campus box office 
representative, there is no limit on 
the number of exchange tickets 
which can be purchased at one 
time.

plan and the board's handling of 
last spring's teachers' strike. 

Larsen feels that the voluntary 
integration plan, worked out by the 
Board of Education after Judge 
Louis Welsh ordered integration of 
city schools, is a good plan which 
will succeed if the people realize 
the opportunities which are 
available With it. 

"But there's a need to c0m-
municate this to the people, and 
that's where the media comes in," 
Larsen said. 

Teacber's Stake _

teachers' . strike is concerned, 
Larsen said she finds fault with the 
way contract negotiations between 
the school administration and the 
SOT A proceeded. 

The teachers association called 
the strike only three weeks aftet' 
negotiations began, and Larsen 
said this is contrary to provisions 
set down in the state's collective 
bargaining act. 

Fisher, who also said she op-

which "avoids busmg, preserves

Welsh's order." 

Fisher would divide the school 
year into three IS-week trimesters. 
During half of one trimester, one 
grade level would be transfered 
from each predominately white 
school to a predominately minority 
school. Each minority school 
would be approximately 50 to 70 
per cent ' white under the plan, 
F1sher.,ud. 

Parents could opt their children 
out of the plan, but Fiaber thiJ)ks 
the lure of smaller claues at the 
minority school would keep most 

Larsen and Fisher also disagree 
on the recent Supreme Court 
decision that school districts can 
fire teachers who are gay, even 
though the teachers have not been 
accused of any crime: 

Asserted Larsen, "The Supreme 
Court is the highest law in the land, 
and I cannot comment any fur-
ther. " 

Fisher said that teachers should 
not be fired for their private 
feelings, as along as they do not 
force those beliefs on students. 

In-council bickering 
~alts gov't progress 
By-laws remain unfinished while AS 
members play at musical chairs 

by ErlcJaye 
After several meetings marred 

by angry exchanges between 
members and prolonged bickering 
over such subjects as how to 
arrange the tables in the council 
chamber, ASUC:SD student officers 
are admitting publicly that the 
govenunent is hindered by per-
sonality differences and confusion. 

At Wednesday night's meeting 
the council was unable to finish 
with the first agenda item, ap-
proval of council by-laws, before 
adjournment. The council has now 
spent five weeks attempting to 
approve the bylaws and has not yet 
completed half the task, according 
to AS Vice-President Mark Sindier. 

It was at Wednesday's meeting 
that the council spent ap-
proximately 20 minutes discussing 
seating arrangements and nearly 
2.'i minutes in a heated discussion of 
Sindler's decision to require 
council members to submit their 
amendments in writing. 

During the AS meeting of Oct. 19 
an exchange between Sindler and 
student welfare commissioner 
Barry Hyman ended with Sindler 
leaving the room. According to 
Sindler, Hyman had accused him 
of "not keeping an idea of what was 
going." Sindler called this, 
"bologna." 

"Why are we bere?" . 
In his report Wednesday night 

President Jeff Leifer addressed 
the problems of the AS. Leifer said, 
"We're having some problems. 1 
don't think we're being very honest 
and I don't think we're putting in 
enough time." Leifer emphasized 
that he didn't feel some AS 
members were working hard 
enough. He asked, "Why are some 
of us here? A lot of people are 
working very hard. But a lot are 
not." 

Before giving his report Leifer 
had asked the Triton Times 
reporter present to hold the 
president's report in confidence. 
Leifer said at that time, " I'm going 
to have to exaggt:rate to get these 
people moving." He conunented 
during his re~rt, "I didn't want 
the students to hear this." 

Laucbter . 
Another discussion which bor-

dered on argument Wednesday 
night con<!erned how the AS by-

laws should deal with the absence 
of members from meetings. One 
college representative explained 
later, "There are four or five 
people who like to miss meetings 
and they were generally opposed to 
having to account for this. " 

During the absence by-law 
discussion External Affairs 
Commissioner Bob Drapeau's 
comment that "a meeting should 
be charismatic enough to keep our 
attention," drew laughter from the 
council. 

Insecurities 
One college commissioner 

commented privately during a lull 
in Wednesday's meeting that many 
of the AS goverrunent's problems 
could be traced to Vice-
President Sindler. This com-
missioner claimed that Sindler, 
who presides over AS meetings, 
was personally overbearing while 
at the same time unable to keep 
order. This commissioner said, 
"Mark likes to reaffinn his in-
securities during the meetings."

Grad students 
may receive 
tuition grants 

by Laura A. Ricbter 
News Editor 

U the Normative Time plan, 
proposed by the UC Special 
Committee to Study PhD 
Programs and in discussion stages 
for over 10 years, is resolved this 
year, PhD students may receive 
tuition grants once they have 
achieved the candidacy stage of 
their graduate work. 

However, some people are 
skeptical about the future of the 
plan. "I'm beginning to wonder 
whether it will ever be decided 
upon," said Peter Tiersma, 
Graduate Student Intern. 

The essence of the plan 
requires that a normative 
completion time for each PhD 
program be established, with 
the norm ranging from four to 
six years. Opportunity funds, 
taken from the overhead 
generated by UC research, 
would be drawn upon to provide 
grants for students who have 
succeeded at the qualifying 
examination during the third 
years of graduate study. The 
incentive for the graduate 
student to complete the degree 
would theoretically be 
augmented through the 
program, which requires that 
graduate students begin paying 
reg fees once again if they 
exceed t. e normative time for 
completeing the PhD program.

ponents are in strong

If you are interested in math, physics or engineering, 

the Navy has a program you should know about. 
It's called the NUPOC-Collegiate Program (NUPOC 

is short for Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate), and if 
you qualify it can pay you as much as $611 a mon~h for 
the remainder of your senior year. Then after 16 weeks of 
Officer Candidate School, you will receive an additional 
year of advanced technical education, education that 
would cost thousands in a civilian school, but in the 
Navy we pay you. And at the end of the year of training, 
you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 

It isn't easy. Only one of every six applicants will be 
selected, and there are fewer than 300 openings. But 
those who make it find themselves in one of the most 
elite engineering training programs anywhere. With 
unequalled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 salary in 
four years, plus travel, medical benefits and education

"From Ohio, eh?" asks the cop. 
"Yeah," say, Cowboy. 
"How long you been in town?" 
"About tweaty minutes off the 

b... I'm going towarda a town 
called Pacific Beach .. " 

"Friends or relatives?" 
'A sister. I came out to look for 

work as a cook." 
" Oh yeah? Lotta people come 

out here for that reason, or the 
weather .... Okay. you look alright. 
1be reason we're checking you out 
is ~t we've Intensified our 
patroling of the downtown area .. ". 

"Trying to clean up the streets? '.' 
"Something Uke thal." The cop 

hands the lD cards back to Cowboy 
and then walks off with the other 
COPII to roost what appears to be a 
transvestite. Cowboy picks up his 
bag and makes !\is way down the 
street. then turns at the first comer 
he comes to. 

He walks past an empty parking 
lot with a worn sign that explains 
the daily rates and a liquor store no 
bigger than his bathroom in 
Toledo, and notices a huge, aging 
movie theatre on the opposite 
corner. The marquee reads "Food 
of the Gods", "The Godfather, Part · 
Two" and "Raw Meat." 

Outside the theatre, a couple of 
hwldred black people wait for the 
bus. Cowboy suddenly feels wry 
nervous, more nervous than be felt 
when he noted .the presence of 
MexiC8ll8. He crosses the street to 
avoidtbem. 

Once he hits the other side, a one-
legged Mexican bracing himself on 
a gnarled wood cane hits him up for 
a handout. 

" Can you give me a dollar for a 
meal?" Most of his teeth are 
missing in front, and the ones that 
remain are coated. with a yellow 
fihn. Cowboy just shrugs and walks 
past the man, who delivers vile 
curses in his wake. 

Cowboy thinks that what he 
needs is a drink. In front of him a 
loud, red, yeDow and purple neon 
sign blaring out vital information. 
Next to it is a small coffee shop 
with three people in it leaning over 
cups of colfee as though lost in 
reflection. 

Olwboy walks on, turns a corner, 
and comes across a place that looks 
friendly enough. He ootices that 
there are service men inside, and 
that country music ts playing on 
the juke box. He waa. in and 
stands there. 1be lights are low; 
his eyes need time to adjust. 

A minute later, be', able 'to 
distinguish objects in the red-tinted 
half light, and makes his way to the 
bar. He crams his suitcase between 
his legs and nervously scans the 
interior. The waDs are painted a 
dysentery green, plumbing pipes 
protrude through the wall 8IK1 
COIIulate in the corners; torn 
travel posters decorate the walls 
and the records on the juke box are 
scratched. 

The place is packed with old men, 
and drunk sailonJ who swear In 
various regional dialects. Alabama 
here, TelWl there, Detroit black 
guy in the mlddle.1be bartender, a 
woman who looks like a former 
Hells Angels mama, asks what he ' 
wants to drink. Olwboy orden a 
rum and coke and sips on It slowly 
when it's delivered. 

James Taylor" "steamroller 
Blues" comes on the juke boL 

Fnm UN! comer of his ear. Cowboy 
notices the strains of harmonica 
playing. It isn't the usual stuff, 
enthusiastic but sloppy. This guy 
could play. The licks were straight 
out of UUle Wallter and Paul 
Butterfield. Emphatic, clean, fast 
and emotional, with each note 
saying it's worth with no strings 
attached. 

He looks around him and sees a 
guy cupping a harmonica to his 
mouth. his eyes closed behind wire-
rimmed glasses. As the song 
concludes, the guy offers a final riff 
as though adding a proper punc-
tuation to an especially eloquant 
sentence. He takes the harp from 
his mouth, pops it back into his 
shirt picket and takes out a 
cigarette. 

"Say, that 's alright," Cowboy 
says to him. "You play that thing 
the way it's supposed to be 
played." . 

"1b8nks," says the harp player, 
"Just happen to have the right 
key ... " 

Q)wboy and the harp player end 
up talking for a couple of hours. 
The harp player turns out to be a 
free lance writer who's just come 
out of a local newspaper office 
where he'd dropped off a story. 
Cowboy tells the harp player about 
himself and relates what bad 
happened to him that night . 1be 
harp player seems amused and 
taking a pocket notebook out of his 
coat pocket, begins scribbling. 

"What 's thatfor?" asks Cowboy. 
"An idea for a story" replies the 

writer. "Say, how do you feel about 
poetry readings and modern art?" 

"I can take It or leave it" says 
Cowboy, his face screwed into a 
puzzled look. "Why?" 

"Well . right upstairs there's a 
olft that a bunch of local artists 
have set up as a gailery. Tonight is 
an invitation only opening, and I 
happen to have an invitation. They 
have poetry readings going on right 
now, with food and drinks for free. 
Wanna check it out 1" 

Cowboy glares at the harp 
player. "You're not a fag, are ya?" 

The harp player grins. "No 
chance. It doesn't matter to me 
whether you come or not. 1'1Jl going 
uptbere anyway." 

... A midnight 
cowboy comes 
to San Diego 

by Ted Navin Burke 
The harp player gets off his stool 

and heads for the door. Cowboy 
grabs his· suitcase and follows. 

Outside the bar, the two are 
confronted with a bath of neon 
lights, car horns and the sound of 
two drunks fighting on the 
sidewalk, looking like dirty laundry 
wjth the pet cat rummaging un-
derneath. They tum a corner, open 
a door and walk up a flight of 
stairs, which squeak In rhythm to 
their pace. At the bead of the 
stairway, a curtain blocks their 
entrance. They push througb it and 
walk inside. 

The loft, once a restaurant and 
now somebody's apartment on loan 
as a gallery, is packed like an 
elevator at quitting time. There's a 
large open area, which Cowboy 
correctly deduces as once having 
been the dining room, with 
sculpture in the middle of the floor 
and paintings on the walls. 

On one sid'e a man with a 
microphone reads poetry, his own, 
presumably, through the crackle 
and sputter of amplification. On the 
other side a man witb an accordian 
shouts to the rafters. The audience, 
clad in string pants, earrings, 
beards, brightly colored shirts, 
sandals and the like, stand about 
talking while this insanity ensues, 
forever brushing hair out of their 
eyes, making faces, taking short 
sips from their plastic wine 
glasses. ' 

Over a PA system comes elec-
tronic music. a swirl of SOWld and 
noise that seems to envelope the 
room with an intoxicating 
cacophony of beeps, b1ata, and 
rddddlllllzzzzzzzzz . A man with n 
race painted like a crescent moon 
walks by and beams a grin at 
Cowboy. 

Cowboy listens hard for things he 
can talk about, but the noise level 
gives him only fragments of 
discourse. 

"Flatness, flatness , that's the 
key, and Patterson is the flattest in 
the area. She 's a very fast painter 
to perceive ... " 

" ... but even Webern is staid 
these days. Much too busy for my 
ears. Riley and Glass are more 
succinct, taking the essential 
sound and stripping it down to a 
bone-bare coda that undulates like 
a pulse beat .. . " 

" ... Artraud was full of shiL." 
" .. . yes, but underneath his 

theory was an essential affirmation 
of what consciousness should be ... " 

" ... a consciousness that denies 
class priorities. I can't think of life 
as a horror show, and can't con-
ceive that being drowned in all that 
odious tripe is going to make me a 
better human being .. . "

thinks she doubts his mascullnlty . 
Given the violent, cheap-thrills 

world which Theresa aeeksout, It's 
no surprise that she comes to a 
violent end. The only thinK I could 

. conclude at the end of the film is 
that women should be more careful 
about who they pick up in singles 
bars. But my mother could have 
told me that. 

What made Judith Roesner's 
novel more than sensaUonalist 
pulp fiction was ber focus 011 the 
destructive Impulse within 
Theresa which leads her to the 
brutalizing world of sinles bars. 
Rossner presents a convincing 
psychlogical portrait of how the 

, 

The thing that saves the flbn 
from being unbearably maudlin is 
Diane Keaton's portrayal of 
'lberesa. She makes Theresa seem 
more than the piUful vicUm that 
Brooks tries to make her, with her 
wit and hwnor. Keaton's Theresa 
doesn't aUow herself to faU foto 
self-pity. 

Good_ succeeds only as a 
portrayal of the horrors of big city 
night life, beea use it so insistent in 
driving its point home. The best 
scenes of the film are the dimly lit 
disco and apartment scenes, which 
convey the danger and decadence 
that seem to hang in the at-
mosphere.

Anyone who's seen more than two 
Ken RosseU fibns should know 
VaieutiDo, his latest project on the 
late silent screen actor, will be less 
than the biography it purports to be. 
Insteand it wiU be a further el· 
tension of the RosseU personality 
into the filmic idiom. 

RosseU has done this collliatenUy 
throughout his career. Womea II 
Love, for instance, took liberties 
with the Lawrence novel so Russell 
could photograph women in aU 
manners of self-loathing positions. In 
whatever he undertakes, the subject 
becomes a sounding board for his 
misanthropic gripes about the stale 
of hUl1l8nity. 

Not that RosseU's predilection for 
showing humans at their worse is an 
aesthetic sin. The aforementioned 
films, despite the indelible Russell 
stamp, contained an energetic 
verve, blessed with good writing and 
dynamic acting , handsomely 
augmented by RosseU's flair for the 
spectacular image. Russell is

Human survival theme brought to SCreel1 
One of the most popular themes 

!n science fiction Uterature II that 
of human slU'Vival against In-
credible odds. It seems that Just 
about every science fiction writer, 
from Issac Aaimov . to Harlan 
ElUaon, has been drawn to the 
theme. 

The problem has been in trar.-
sposinS this popular subject in 
decent fashion to the screen. 
DamDaUoll ADey-wblch bears 
resemblance to Roger Zelazny's 
novel only in name and setUng-is 
one of the better attempts at 
bringing the human survival 
theme from literature to ceUuIoid 
(at least for the fll'St 85 minutes of 
this hour-and-a-half movie l. 

The film is set in a post-World 
War III world, after aU the nations 
have unleashed their nuclear 
annaments. Jan-Michael Vincent 
and George Peppard are two 
military officers who, hidden deep 
in an Air Force installaUon in 
California, survive the blast. Two 
years later, they, along with Paul 
WUlfield and another survivor, set 
off in two heavy-4uty vehicles 
caUed Land Masters, in search of 
life in Albany, New York. 

A1l America is now wracked by 

radiation, kUler storms .1nd 
mutant creatures, they foDow what 
Denton calls "damnation aUey," 
the path of least resistance across 
the country. 

Along the way the liWe band 
encounters death and adventure at 
the hands of wind stonos end 
mutant beasts and picks up two 
new travellers, Dominique Sanda 
and Jackie Earle Haley, With such 
a plot the film soon starts to 
resemble an eighteenth century 
episodic novel, as the heroes 
proceed from one unrelated ad-
venture to another on their way to 
Albany. 

And, in the end, it is this type of 
plot which mars what is otherwise 
an enjoyable film. It is not easy to 
have a satisfactory ending for an 
episodic plot. A!'ld director Jack 
Smight and screenwriters Alan 
Sharp and Lukas Heller did not 
(j.nd one ; DamnaUOD Alley ends 
with a Delli ex macbiDa device 
which is neither fitting nor 
satisfactory . 

The uneven quality of the story 
line is not carried over to the ac-
ting. Peppard and Vincent played 
well off each other-with Vincent as 
the freedom-loving young man and 

1 has fallen into Mailer syndrome 
else if not a thoroughly 

ve, resourceful and 
deft director.

corrunences with a 

of headlines which blare 
of his death. This segues to 

the funeral parlour where he's been 
laid out. Crowds of people fonn 
outside the parlour for a last 
glimpse of their idol. Then, a reUnue 
of characters from Valentinos' life 
file past to relate' portions of the 
Valentino story to ghoul-eyed 
reporters . 

This supplies the crux ofthe film, a 
series of flashbacks that teU of 
Valentinos' rise from being a styliSh 
dance haU gigalo, to a bistro hoofer 
in a second rate vaudville act, to his 
eventual climb to the top box office 
draw in the nation. Unfortunately, 
the Valentino character is never 
fully defined , with details of com-
plexity-a longing for a simple life, 
concem about his manhood because 
of press inference that he's an im-
potent pansy-glosses over with a 
light first coat that never gets to the 
grain. 

Significantly, Valentino is a 
shadow-ahow full of characters of no 
substantial weight who mouth lir.es 
that sound like plagiarism of 

Nathaniel Wests' brillant novel Day 
of the Locusts. Rather than build 
upon ideas, tell the Valentino story 
or make the characters more 
human, Russell dwells upon his 
primary objects of hate ; Hollywood 
and the press. 

Hollywood is depicted as a flesh-
eating system where concern for the 
dollar bill overrides concern for the 
talent under contract. The press is 
seen as a parasitic force constantly 
invading privacy, eager to destroy 
people it dislikes, which displays the 
manner of a lout. There is truth to 
these charges, but it's impossible to 
separate them from Russell's own 
experience, since he was ignored by 
American producers, and has been 
the victim of bad reviews over the 
years, 

Valentino is an expensive exercise 
in sour grapes, and it seems unlikely 
that Russel 's newly fashioned chest-
thumping stance will lighten in years 
to come. More's the pity.

PARADIGM LOST ... 
[Ceatiaaed from pqe.] 

time television bad at least one full 
time wile us on the payroll. 

LoU Gnat· Journalism 11 a 
boring profession to make into a 
weekly television drama, but that 
hasn't stopped the makers of Loa 
Grant ff(Jlll proceeding anyway. 
Lou Gram (Ed Aaner), having 
been fired from the news show be 
produced 011 the Mary Tyler Moore 
Show. baa landed a job u city 

ed~tor for the Loa Angeles Tribune, 
a fictional daD,. 

So far, the Strength of the show 
has been in the develosment of 
characters and in the way tbey 
interact in the office and on tbe job. 
Grant is a hard-assed veteran with 
a prejudice towards bard news 
over glittery feature stories, but at 
times he reveals tbe soft edge of 
the beer drinking sentimentalist. 
Rossi is an over-eager in· 
vestigative reporter whose per • 
sonality has won him respect but 
few friends. 

"Animal" is a bipple 
photographer of slovenly personal 
habits wbo manages to get spec-
tacular news photos each week. 
Mrs. Pynchon is tbe eccentric 
woman publisher of tbe Trib who's 
W1predictibllity makes the men in 
the company quake in their boots. 

Thus far, this microcosmic 
gaggle of " interesting but lovable" 
characters bave used journalism 
as a sort of cardboard backdrop 
against which tbey can further 
endear themselves to the public, 
but Lou Graut on occasion does 
tackle controversy. 

Last week, a woman reporter did 

a prome on a local Nazi leader. A 
bare minimum of researcb 
revealed the leader to be a self 
loatbing Jew. Mortified wben tbe 
story came to print, the Nazi aced 
himself witb a bullet in the head. 
The woman reporter blames 
berself at episode's end and begins 
to cry. A conaoUng Grant preaches 
that ber story taugbt WI more 
about ouraelves and tbe world we 
Uve in ." 

In true fashion, Lou Grant 
carries on a great tradition of 
televisioll'drama with a genius for 
defusing aensWve i.s8ues and 
rendering them into trivlalized 
pablum. The only thing one reaDy 
learns from this kind of stuff is a 
confirmation .of Walter Cronkites; 
admonishments to the American 
public : "Anyone who thinb they 
can get aD tbe information they 
need from television alone bas 
rocks in their bead." But because 
we, tbe audience , were denied 
seeing the Nazi as a human being 
put on tbe fringe for reasons more 
complex than tbe aecond hand 
Freud thrust upon us by tbe writers 
is besides the point.. 

Lou _Grant isn't abou! journalisJ.n, 
but about Lou Grant hi.maelf and 
tbe people he habitates tbe office 
witb. To that extent, tbe show is an 
absolute success. If the show rides 
out tbe season and is renewed next 
year, it may yet reach tbe level of 
light hearted commaraderie of 
Hogan's Heroes, a ' show that 
proved that life in a Nazi con-
centration camp was a . laugh a 
minute .
