UCSD students who participated in the first annual whale hunt were 
excited to see whales, but no one was unhappy to get back on shore. 

Whaling Over Bounding Main 
Rick Drom 

The first annual Triton Times Whale 
hunt was almost a resounding sucess. 

UCSD has always been associated 
with the sea and oceanography. 
Indeed all eight residence halls at 
Revelle are named after famous 
oceanographic vessels. But how many 
Tritons have ever spent time away from 
solid ground? 

The Triton Times was anxious to 
allow students to taste life at sea so it 
appealed to the Revelle Guest-in-
Reside nce Committee for help. 
Together they decided to sponser a 2'/2 
hour ocean cruise to watch migrating 
whales. 

The plan seemed very simple. 
Students would board a bus at Urey 
Hall which would take them to a 
chartered boat. The boat would then 
cruise down to the Coronado Islands 
and follow the migrating California 
Grey Whales. The Triton Times would 
provide free advertising and the Com-
mittee would help to subsidize each 
participant. 

Tuesday the organisers received 
word that the 120-person boat that 
they chartered could not be used on 
January 29th, the day of the trip. 
Instead, only a 50-person boat could 
be chartered. Sign-ups reopened . 
Thursday the larger boat discovered 
that it also could not sail on Saturday. 
Sign-ups were closed . 

Finally a ship large enough to hold 
those that had already signed up was 
located. â€¢ 

Despite these difficulties, the Coast 
Cruiser left Urey Hall promptly at 10:30 
A.M. on Saturday, bound for Quivera 
Ba in, loaded with Tritons. After a small 
mix-up, all 65 arrived at their destina-
tion, Fisherman's Landing. 

The sun was warm as we waited to 
Joard the "San Diego" Indeed, as it 
slowly chugged out of the harbor at 
11 :45 it looked like a very warm 
journey was ahead. 

But as the "San Diego" left the San 
Diego hargor it picked up speed and a 
frigid ocean breeze cooled everyone 
off. All eyes were out to sea as each 
sought a glimpse of the mighty 
levia than, of the sea, the California 
Grey whale. 

Grey whales belong to the family of 
Baleen whales who migrate each 
winter to warmer waters. In the 
summer they are found in the Bering 
ea. But as winter approaches, they 

split into two groups and head south. 
One group follows the coast of Korea 
and Japan; the larger group go down 
Our coast past Oregon and California. 
Their destination is the warm lagoons 
in Baja California yvhere their young 
ar born. 

It is not known precis Iy how many 
Grey whales still exist. They were 
almost exterminated by hunters until 
1895 when were law. 

A study in 1961 indicated that over 
6,000 Grey whales passed Point Loma 
that season. 

After a half hour at sea no whales 
had been sighted but already a few of 
the passengers didn't care. The ocean 
swells had become qui te large and it 
felt like a roller-coaster ride as the ship 
went down one side of a swell and up 
the other. The shipped dropped out 
from under foot and then it bounced 
back up. Thus began the time-honored 
ritual of feedi ng the sea with that 
mornings breakfast. 

Of course most of the Tritons were 
unaffected, but there was a group of 
Boy Scouts on board who should have 
stuck to rubbing sticks together on dry 
land. 

No one cried out, "Thar she blowsl" 
in the traditional manner but almost 
everybody screamed in unison as the 
first whale spout was seen. The guide 
on the ship announced that it was 
probably a pregnant female. They 

u~ually travel singly and spout often, 
he explained. 

After that we saw spouts and the 
backs of these monsters of the seas 
about every five minutes. The skipper 
of the ship tracked the whales' 
movements with sonar. But each time 
that the ship approached near a whale, 
it would sound, (blow its spout) and 
dive. This was termed "fluking" 
because the whale would raise its rear 
portion, flukes, out of the water in the 
process. 

Some of these flukings were quite 
spectacular, but none was nearer than 
onehundred yards from the ship. Often 
the ship would approach near a whale 
only to have a fishing boat or sailboat 
come by and scare the whale away. 
One time, seven spoutings were seen 
in about two minutes. There must have 
been at least three or more whales 
traveling in that group. 

The skipper of the ship kept 
repeating, "The whales are not 
cooperating today," or "They are very 
uncooperative today". On a good day 
many whales can been seen and 
sometimes they will even come right 
up to the ship and look it over. That 
didn't happen last Saturday. 

By 1 :45 we were well out to sea and 
had to turn around and head for shore. 
By then it was quite cool. On the way 
back the ride was again quite rough, 
but this time there was nothing to take 
one's mind off of the ocean swells. 
More scouts and a few Tritons con-
tinu d to give offerings to the sea in 
hopes of quelling the waves. 

Everyone seemed glad to step on to 
terra firma, especially the scout. All 
arrived home afely, but th ir journ y 
would not be soon forRotten. Many of 
the Tritons could still feel the sway of 

. th ocean a they lay on their bed that 
night. 

Fourth College: 
An Entity or Set of Courses 

Greg Hid(s 
A large number of course re-

quirements and a'n emphasis on prac-
tical application of knowledge are part 
of the outline for Fourth College, ac-
fording to Roy D'Andrade, chairman of 
the planning committee for Fourth 
College. Mr. D' Andrade (speaking, it 
should be noted, in an ind ividual 
capacity and not as a spokesman for 

, the committee) stated that the general 
intention of the college is to perform 
the functions that neither Revelle, 
Muir, or Third College perform at the 
present time. 

One distinctive feature of the con-
cept for Fourth College, Mr. D' An-
drade said, is an emphasis on " present 
day problem areas in society, culture, 
and the world". The proposed 
curriculum for the college includes, he 
said, twenty required courses in the 
areas of Humanities and Arts, Natural 
Science, Math, and Social Sciences. 
Five courses will be required in each of 
these areas. Three of the five courses 
required in each area will be taken in a 
three course sequence, some of which 
are interdisciplinary. There will be a 
number of choices of possible se-
quences within each area of study, 
thus, in Mr. D' Andrade's estimation, 
providing for breadth as well as choice 
on the part of the student. Courses 
taken for a major can fulfill the 
remaining requirement of two courses 
in one of the four areas of study. 

One matter which was discussed a 
great deal in the committee, Mr. O'An-
drade said, was the question of the 
number of general course re-
quirements. He said that the final deci-
sion of the committee was to include 
both breadth and choice in the 
program of requirements. Another 
decision of the committee was to allow 

students to choose whether they 
wanted to complete requirement 
courses and then participate in inter-
disciplinary courses, or to take inter-
disciplinary courses sooner. 

As far as the problem of 'weak' 
courses is concerned, Mr. D'Andrade 
stated that the solution to the problem 
is to maintain a high quality faculty. 
One method of evaluation the success 
or failure of the college is, he said, the 
establishment of an "education evalua-
tion and experimentation unit". Th is 
would provide a means of student 
evaluation of the courses they have 
taken; a student could, for example, 
evaluate a course two years after he 
took it, so that he would be able to say 
how much the course had helped him. 

A number of questions have been 
raised in connection with the outline 
and orientation of the school. Michele 
Peltier, a student representative on the 
planning committee, stated that the 
college was not being discussed " as an 
entity, but as a set of courses". She 
stated that the planning for the college 
has not sufficiently taken into account 
student wants and needs. In particular, 
she said that the present plans are for a 
highly structured college, without suf-
ficient room for choice or planning on 
the part of the students. Ms. Peltier 
stated that if students wish to have a 
greater say in the planning of the 
college, they should speak up and 
make their wishes known to those who 
are concerned with this planning. 

The tentative plans for the college 
will be officially presented this week. 
The preliminary outline still must go 
through the committee on Educational 
Pol icy and Academic Senate before 
further action is taken on the general 
proposals which the committee sub-
mits. 

Ruiz and Affirmative Action 
Oi cussing Affirmative 

Action last Thursday at a 
noon meeting of UC D 
Women, Dr. Ramon Ruiz, 
Chairman of th Depart-
ment of History, asserted "I 
believe in it more than you 
do." 

Dr. Ruiz defended his 
department, in which four 
of the twenty members 
represent minority groups 
(1 black, 1 woman , I 
chicano, and Ruiz him elf 
of Mexican extraction), as 
having the best record on 
"thi god-forsaken cam-
pus." At present one other 
woman and one black are 
also being considered for 
positions in his depart-
ment, where Ruiz gives 
priority in hir i ng to 
minoriti s, women, and 

Kathy Redding 
others, "in that order." 

tressing the need for 
"social conscience" as op-
po ed to "women for the 
sake of women," Ruiz ad-
vocat d the quota sy tem 
for placement of wom n in 
important positions . He 
alo entertained 
suggestions from the goup 
of husband -wife team 
teaching and mandatory 
hiring of women in the 
establi hment of a UCSD 
fourth college. 

Although he de cribed 
publication as the most im-
portant ta k of University 
profes ors, Dr. Ruiz voiced 
opinions on the econdary 
function of teaching , 
deploring R veil Call ge 
a sa" 1 91 h - c e n t u r y

curriculum. Its humanities 
sequence, he said, is " the

Woman Writer in 
a Male Culture 

"The Woman Writer in a Male Culture" will be 
discussed by Christiane Rochefort, French novelist 
from Paris, France, at a Literature Department Informal 
Wednesday afternoon meeting on January 24, 1972 at 4 
p.m. in the Formal Lounge, Revelle. Ms. Rochefort has 
been widely acclaimed for her novel Le repos 
duguerrier 1958; trans. Warrior's Rest, Mckay, N.Y., a 
study of the privatism of a manÂ·woman relationship. 
She has continued her satirical commentary on modern 
life in Les Petits enfants du siecle (1961; trans. The 
Children of Heaven), a tale of the rootless life in the 
new working-class suburbs of Paris; Les Stances a 
Sophie (1964; trans. as Cats Don't Care for Money and 
recently made into a f film using American jazz 
musician Joseph Jarman and his group on the sound-
track) ; In 1969, her novel Le Printemps au Parking 
dealing with the search for a new life-style by the youth 
of the sixties, came out. Her latest book, ('est bizarre, 
I'ecriture is the story of the writing of a novel. She is an 
active member of the Women's Liberation Movement 
in France (MLf) and has appeared as a spokewoman on 
French television. All are welcome to attend the 
discussion. 

UCSD Women to 
Hear Chancellor 

This Thursday at noon, January 25th, UCSD women 
will hear a tape recording of Chancellor McElroy's 
statement to the Departments heads at the October 
workshops or at Affirmative Action. 

Biomedical Lecture 
Biologist-geneticist Seymour Benzer will deliver the 

first Biomedical Lecture of 1973 at the UC San Diego 
School of Medicine, Wednesday, January 24. 

The admission-free discussion of "Genes and 
Behavior in Drosophila" will be at 8:30 pm in the 
Garren Auditorium on the first floor of the Basic 
Science Building on the La Jolla campus. The public is 
invited. 

Dr. Benzer is responsible for showing that single 
functional genes can be split into hundreds of smaller 
recombining elements. By splitting genes and un-
raveling their internal structure he forced a reexamina-
tion of the classical concepts of these elementary units 
of heredity. 

Page 2 Triton Times Tuesday, January 23, 1973 

Dr. Renzer began his career as a physicist, but soon 
b~came captivated by the possibilities of applying 
physical concepts to biological problems. Subse-
quently he concentrated his research on behavioral 
biology. Since 1967 he has been Professor of Biology 
at Califol'nia Institute of Technology where he is 
investigating the behavior of the fruit fly 
(Drosophila). 

After receiving his Ph.D. from Purdue University, 
Dr. Benzer accepted a position there as an instructor 
of Physics. Later he became an Associate Professor of 
Biophysics at Purdue. In 1968 the University awarded 
him an honorary Doctor of Science degree. 

Among the many awards and honors he has 
received are the Signma Xi Research Award, the 
Lasker Award in 1971, and the Gairdner Award of 
Merit in Canada. He has also published more than 50 
articles in the fields of physics, molecular biology, 
and behavioral biology. 

Alternative Television 
A series pf public lectures to explore the use of 

cable television as an alternative to traditional broad-
cast media began at the University of Califorrnia, San 
Diego, last Thursday, January 18. 

The lectures will be held in Room 2100 of the Basic 
Science Bldg., School of Medicine, from 4-6 p.m. 
every Thursday through March 8 with one excep- ' 
tion .The lecture normally to be scheduled Thursday, 
February 22, will be given Friday, February 23. 

The series is part of any upper division course in 
cable television under the direction of Oscar Gandy, 
UCSD Lecturer in Communications, and sponsored 
by the Communications Program of UCSD'S Third 
College. 

Beginning with the development of radio and 
television broadcast capability, the series will in-
vestigate the development of communications in-
stitutions and policy as it relates to public interest. 
Differing perspectives will be presented by broad-, 
casters, cable television professionals, system users, 
and communications instructors. 

Early lectures will provided some familiarity with 
the technological differences between broadcast 
and coaxial systems, with specific attention given to 
channel capacity, system interaction, and cost of 
construction and access. 

The remainder of the series will deal with the more 
operational questions related to cable television 
such as regulation and programming. 

Upcoming lecturers include Nathaniel E. Feldman, 
an engineer and staff member of the RAND Cor-
poration for the past 12 years and author of several 
key references in the field of communications 
technology and planning, will give the second lec-
ture January 25. He will discuss the current state of 
cable television and make some projections about 
future coaxial systems. . 

Clayton H. Brace, Vice President and General 
Manager of KGTV, Channel 10, in San Diego, will 
discuss the regulation of cable television from the 
point of view of a broadcaster at the February 1 
lecture. 

On February 8, Leonard K. Tozer, General 
Manager of Southwestern Cable Company of Pacific 
Beach will discuss his involvement in landmark 
regu latiory decisions by the Federal Com-
municat ions Commission and related problems with 
copyright, city franchise, and system expansion. 

The central issues of cable regulation as they relate 
to protection of public interest will be discussed 
February 15 by Alfred G. Ferris, corporation attorney 
and partner in the San Diego firm of Ferris, Weather-
ford, Brennan & Lerg. 

Donald O. Williams, General Manager of Cable 
TV, Inc. in EI Cajon, will lecture February 23 on his ' 
recent experiences and future plans for local 
origination programming as well as identifying the 
problems of origination. 

Don Bushnell, Director of the Watts Communica-
tion Bureau, Inc. of the Mafundi Institute, Los 

Angeles, will discuss plans for a Watts cable televi-
sion system in his lecture March 1. 

The final lecture, March 8, will be a discussion of 
the social implications of . current and future 
developments i!, coaxial communications. Lecturer 
will be Walter S. Baer, author of several reports and 
studies on communications systems. He is currently 
consultant to the RAND Corporation's com-
munications policy program. 

The True Confessions 
of St. Augustine 
willi lalll ~ 1M transl ..... 

Edward Simons 
The seasonal Interest In St. Augustine being once 

ilg.in upon us, It Is perhaps flÂ«lng that this man be 
resurrected for your readlns pleasure. And why noU 
( Someone was bound to resurred him sooner or later.) 

Great art thou, 0 Lord, and greatly to be praised : 
great is thy power, and thy wisdom is infinite. And man, 
who being a part of what thou hast created, is desirous 
to praise thee. I admire thee, 0 Lord, and thy majesty; I 
am inflamed with a desire to praise thee. See, 0 lord, 
how the rash spreads, the blue line from my heart to 
my navel. 

Now that I have buttered thee up, 0 Lord, possibly 
we can make a deal mutually advantageous to us both . 
I'll take Hippo, and thou, 0 Great lord, can doest what 
thou please with what remains. 

(So ends the first chapter. The .rest is concerned with 
calling upon God, and from the translator'S point of 
view, pretty heavy stuff.) 

A.nd how shall I call upon my God; my lord and 
,Godl because that when I invoke him, I call him into 
myself; and what place is there in fit for thee to come 
into mel Indeed I but wear a size 13 surplice. 

(And finally we come to the whole poinÂ·t of the book : 
Augustine's Conversion, whereupon he turns into a 
Christian.) 

So soon therefore a deep consideration even from 
the secret bottom of my soul grew large and my errors 
seemed to me to form a large heap in fromt of my eyes. 

I decided to leave Alypius and his comforting abode. 
I climbed over the heap and left. My soul longed to be 
alone and my pride could little bear the eyes of others 
seeing me weep. I came upon a fig tree, I know not 
how, and flung myself into what shade the tree offered, 
pushing away a dog that was lurking by the trunk. All 
around the ground, even that under the tree, was hot. 
Yet where I sat was cool. Was this the visitation of the 
lordl Had I at last cought his attention I 

No, it was not that. I was too late. The dog had struck. 
This made me weep all the more and for a moment, I 
considered removing the onion slices from under my 
eyes- but only for a moment. Suddenly, I heard a voice 
call Gut my name. 

" Augustinel" 
I looked around but no one did I see. 
The voice came again. "Augustinel" 
"Yes?" I answered, sure in the secret bottom of my 

heart who ' spoke my name. "Yes, my Lordi Speak, 0 
speak! Thy servant Augustine awaits thy words, which 
will fall upon my ears, to be greeted like a starving man 
greets a big, juicy-" â€¢ 

"Augustine! I" 
"Yes, my Lordi" 
"For once in your life- shut up and listenl" 
I bowed my head in reverence to God's command. 

" Yes, my Lord. What is itl" 
"That's it, fat-mouth. Just shut up and listen." 
Somehow, for some reason, I was expecting 

something different. 
Weren't youl

Creation Hypothesis Lacks 
Critical Compinents to Merit 
Presentation ~/ongside 
Science Cirricula. 
Dear Sirs: 

Ordinarily I wouldn't 
argue with creationists 
since they are committed, 
for their own reasons, to a 
set of postulates which are 
inconsistent with those of 
science. However the letter 
by Messrs Cantor and 
Sjaholm, and the threat of 
placing creationist 
teaching in public school 
science curricula prompts 
this. To teach that the 
tenets of a religion have 
equal weight in deter-
mining scientific truth as 
do those of science is 
dangerous to the develop-
ment of accurate scientific 
ability in those who would 
learn it. Science involves 
meticulous (we hope) 
observation, verifiable by 
independent, skeptical 
observers; hypothesis 
generation based on all 
relevant facts; critical 
resting of the hypothesis; 
and rejection of 
hypotheses which fail the 
tests. Of two hypotheses 
which explain an observa-
tion equally, the less com-
plex is accepted (Occam's 
razor). Of two alternative 
hypotheses, one with valid 
supporting evidence and 
one without evidence, the 
former is accepted, 
regardless of lack of 
evidence against the latter. 
Both creation and evolu-
tion will explain a given 
life- form in the fossil 
record, but whereas the 
evolution hypothesis re-
quires explanations of 
mechanism for mutation 
and natural selection, 
which are successfully 
being provided by science 
in more and more detail, 
creation requires an ex-

planation of the 
mechanism by which it is 
achieved , and if a 
"creator" is invoked, of 
how it came to be and of 
how it works, about which 
science has nothing to say 
since none of these are 
observable or subject to 
scientific study. The crea-
tion hypothesis lacks 
evidence for some critical 
components and involves a 
more complex explanl-
tion, To give it equal status 
in a science class subverts 
the principles on which 
science rests. 

Not that the scientific 
method is infallible, nor 
that valid controversies 

, don't exist in science, but 
consistently the scientific 
method has been the most 
successful yet devised to 
explain, predict, and con-
trol the un iverse we live in. 

As fo~ Messrs Cantor and 
Sjaholm, before fossils 
were recognized as being 
"our most direct link with 
the prehistoric past", it was 
widely held in European 
culture that God created 
Adam and Eve lock stock 
and barrel from clay and 
ribs. Since then, science 
has been filling in the 
"transitional forms" one at 
a time. To argue 'that gaps 
in the fossil record, which 
are progressively 
narrowing, support crea-
tion over evolution is 
wishful thinking. Secondly, 
evolution is not "contrary 
to the second law of ther-
modynamics" . Anyone 
who thinks it is doesn't 
understand the second 
law . Consult a ther-
modynamics textbook.

UCSD Women Offer 
Proposals for Fourth 
. College Planning 
Dear Dr. D'Andrade: 

As you know, the University is pledged to making a 
good faith effort to provide equal educational and 
employment opportunities for women and minorities 
at UCSD. The effort in regard to minorities has been at 
least partially successful. There are now some upper 
level minority professors and administrators, and 
courses in and from the minority perspective are being 
offered. 
This success, small though it has been, has been due 

primarily to the institutional tool Third College has 
provided. Women, unfortunately, have had no such 
aid, and in spite of professed commitments, little 
progress has been made in rectifying the disadvantaged 
position of women at UCSD. There are only a few 
women faculty members at UCSD and most of them are 
at the lowest steps; there are no women administrators 
in any significant policy making positions; courses from 
the women's perspective are virtually non-existent. 

We of UCSD Women therefore strongly urge your 
Committee to provide through Fourth College the 
institutional vehicle that alone can ensure that oppor-
tunities are in fact equalized for both sexes. 

In the matter of the name alone, Fourth College 
could set a precedent-making example. If the college is 
named after one of our great women not a European, 
for in Europe women are often considered men's 
intellectual equals, but an Americana great step 
forward could be taken. Both men and women alike 
will benefit from the recognition that women have 
made a significant contribution to American society, 
and not just in the home. Naming Fourth College after 
someone like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, for example, 
would do much to overcome the negative psy-
chological assumptions implicit in the present situation 
wherein only men have been considered of sufficient 
stature to honor in naming a college after them. 
Although this matter may at present be. beyond the 
charge of your Committee, your group can, and 
should, go on record in favor of this recommendation. 

However, in the curriculum offered and in the 
organizational structure for Fourth College much can 
be done to help provide women the kinds of 
educational and employment opportunities not yet 
availaable to them at UCSD. The legal requireroents of 
the Education Act of 1972, which will have to be 
enforced whatever may be the policies of the Nixon 
Administration, demand immediate attention. Fourth 
College offers the most viable tool for ensuring that 
those requirements are indeed met. 

UCSD Women would, therefore, like to meet with 
your Committee as soon as possible to discuss these 
proposals in detail. Very truly yours,

1M Basketball 
Scor s Quickly 

Due Phillips 

Here we are only two weeks il'llo the quarter and the 
intramural basketball season is already producing some 
interesting surprises. Take for example the strange 
goings-on in the Gouda Burst League, where SALT 
AND PEPPER got out spiced by Roger Gottfried's fired-
up FIG MOTHERS. It looks as if only MIZER'S REJECTS 
(named ,for the dearly departed reject himself) will 
have a chance of stopping Roger's gang, if they can 
snap back from their loss to RUBBER BAND. 

Over in the Harlequ in Canape League one of the 
pre-sea-son favorites, DRY HEAVES, fell to what now 
looks to be the class of a classless league, the DORKS. 
Unless the lowly HONKERS can get in their way, the 
appropriately named dORKS may stumble to the 
league title. 

Meanwhile, Doug's SCREAMING PYGMIES got the 
jump on the Berlinkranzer League by destroying 
highly-touted L C SHADOWS. THE LlTILE MEN, if they 
can find someone big enough to contain Stretch 
Yokota and get by the CHOKEFAKES (usually com-
parable to beating the 1962 ew York Mets in a clutCh 
game)could sneak through their league. 

Coed basketball has produced an amazing spectrum 
of teams this year, rangil]g from the lovable "hang-
loose run around and have a ball while you're getting 
creamed" ALAMO W B'A to the devastating MRS. 
MOSS with hotshots Norma and Carla terrorizing their 
opponents. Other than the latter, the toughest teams 
seem to be in the listering League where everyone will 
be having a ball with CAMEL'S HUMPS (rumored to be 
the best in town at the price), especially those well-
known perverts, the GOOSERS, ifrheydon'tget rolled 
right out of the gym. Of course Jock Elliott has put 
together another great team, and this quarter she's 
playing with guys as well as girls. We always knew that 
Cheryl was a versatile young lady. Of course we have to 
ment ion the greatest anomaly of all, Bubbles' BODIES. 
Can't help wondering where she got them. 

AII -i n-all, it looks like a fine basketball season . If the 
BEESH EATERS don't get the KLAP playing with MRS. 
MOSS in the Pristeen League and the MICKEY 
MOUSERS don't wind up with LEATHER BALLS after 
playing the PUMPERS, all should be fine. If you get 
bored on a Sunday, Tuesday, or Wednesday night, 
come on over to the gym and watch some of the 
action .. . it never stops. 

The UCSD hoopsters 
emerged from a weekend 
of disconcerting basketball 
at the All-Cal Tournament 
at UC Irvine with one win 
and two hard-fought 
losses. After a shaky first 
half Thursday night against 
UC Santa Cruz, the Tritons 
smoked for 19 straig ht 
points and eventually won 
85-65. Albeit basically a 
sloppily played game, the 
Tritons enjoyed their most 
balanced scoring attack of 
the year. paul Trainer led 
the way with 19, and he was 
closely followed by Gie 
Simpson with 12, Pet e 
Henderson with 10, Herb 
Hunter with 9, and Jon Le 
Levier with 7. Boom Boom 
Breathwaite and Steve 
Hig g in s enjoyed their 
highest point totals of the 
year as they garnered 13 
and 8, respectively. 

The next night the 
Tritons battled UCI, which 
on paper appeared to be a 
fruitless task. Irvine was big 

AII~Cal Slides 
Past Tritons 

(a 6-11 center and 6-8 and 
6-6 forwards) and com-
posed of former high 
school and JC stars who are 
all on scholarship. But any 
diehard Triton fan will tell 
you that UCSD basketball 
teams love to take on this 
type of team. This year's 
club is no exception as they 
outhustled and outplayed 
the Anteaters, but were ex-
asperatingly thwarted, 
largely due to some of the 
strangest officiating ever 
seen. UCSD was assessed 
29 foul s to UCl's 18 which 
actually should come as no 
surprise to anyone who is 
into Orange County 
basketball. Orange County 
officials seem to be par-
ticularly intent upon 

protecting their own by 
disproportionate foul-
calling. Witness, for exam-
ple, the USD - Southern 
California College game 
which was played last 
Saturday night at SCC in 
Costa Mesa . USD was 
beaten in overtime by a 
team which they had pew-
cioualy clobbered by 33 
points in San Diego, and 
the foul discrepancy was 
even more pronounced 
than in the UCSD + UCI 
game. In any case, suffice it 
to say that the Tritons 
wound up on the short end 
of a 66-60 score. Tall Paul 
and Gie led the scoring 
with 20 and 14, respective-
ly, and with the help of 
some raucous support

from the cheerleader, a 
contingent from Third, and 
some loyal Del Marites, 
almost managed to pull off 
the victory. 

The following night 
began on an incredible 
note as the same officials 
who refereed the previous 
night were on hand once 
again. The Tritons didn't 
lose their poise, but still 
went down to defeat at the 
hands of UC Davis by a 
score of 74-69. Both sides 
played well and it was a 
lack of clutch play by the 
Tr itons that spelled defeat. 
Paul and Gie again led the 
scoring with 24 and 18 
points, respectively. 

The Tritons hope to get 
back on the winning track 
this Friday against West-
mont in the UCSD gym at 8 
pm. Westmont is ranked 
No. 12 in the nation in 
NAIA basketball, and an 
upset could give UCSD a 
good shot at a national 
tournament berth.

provides hstings of available 
teacher homes throughout The UCSD wrestling team ac-

complished one of their more 
astonishing feats - in a season which has 
featured many for them - a week ago 
last weekend (or the weekend before 
last if that clarifies matters) by once 
again walking away with the CalTech 
tournament crown. Their tournament 
victory was high I ighted by outstanding 
performances by the entire team, 
notably Curtis Tom, Jorge Correa, Javier 
Correa and big man John Knapp. 

It was a case of narrow victory as the 
wrestlers came away with a mere 3 point 
victory margin. Each year UCSD 
proceeds to the tournament fearing that 
this will be th~ year they lose their 
crown (they have never lost the tourna-
ment since they've been going), and this 
year the fear was more prominent than 
usual. Coach Pinkerton, despite the 
confidence he has in his wrestlers, 
seriously felt that this year they would 
place second or third, merely because 
of their debilitating Ick of depth. He was 
pleasantly surprised when three 
wrestlers took firsts and another took a 
third for the grapplers tournament-
winnin/! 57111 points. 

The usual performers of UCSD 
showed their prowess in taking firsts. 
Jorge Correa continued in his 
asto ni shing winning ways taking all 
three of his matches, becoming the 
tourna ments MVP for the second year in 
a row. He accomplished his third victory 
by pinning his opponent in less thaen a 
mi nute (there are eight minutes allotted 
per match) and perhaps just as amazing, 
po lishing off all three of his opponents 
in a little less then 6% minutes. 

Javier Correa followed in his brother's 
footsteps in a style just slightly less 
glamorous. He defeated his thref: op-
ponents for a fi rst in a time of less then 
12 minutes. Old man John Knapp, in his 
slow, methodical and not too flashy 
style, finished off the three obstacles put 
in his path in a time of 9Y2 minutes on 
his way to the first place gold. Perhaps 
the most crucial finisher, however, was 
Curtis Tom who wrestled outstandingly 
to finish third . Also wrestling well 
enough to win pins in the first round 
were John Duberg and Jeff Legge. 

The stage was set for quite a finale at 
the tournament. The score was 43 Y2 -

43 112-39111 as Southern CaliÂ·fornia 
Collese and Cal State Los Angeles were 
both tied for first with UCSD third going 
into the finals . The odds were against 
UCSD even more, since SCC had 4 men 
going to the finals, CSULA had 3 men in 
the finals and 3 in the consolation while 
UCSD had only 4 wrestlers left 
altogether, 3 in the finals and 1 in the 
consolation bracket, along with their 
four point deficit. This situation 
necessitated a victory by each of UCSD's 
wrestlers over their individual op-
ponents. The finals were first and Jorge 
and Javier Correa along with John 
Knapp all came thro ugh with their 
needed victories. What it all came down 
to was the Curtis Tom consolation 
match. Needless to say he won under all 
the pressure, we won as a team conse-
quently, and the traditiohal Holly~ood 
ending came true with UCSD walking 
away with the gold once again. 

The tournament was not an easy one-
which you might first i.magine upon 
hearing it is the Cal Tech tournament. 
There were 16 teams entered and these 
included a host of formidable wrestling 
powers, such as California State Univer-
sity at Los Angeles and Southern Califor-
nia College. Coach Pinkerton was quite 
pleased, after he was finished being 
shocked, with the performance of his 
wrestlers. They each performed quite 
well and, to put it truthfully, he was at a 
loss for words to describe their tremen-
dous team effort and individual perfor-
mances. It all came down to the entire 
team putting forth maximum effort in 
achieving this victory. The team was 
undermanned and underdogged but 
largely on pure guts and determination 
pulled it out. 

The problem UCSD must face now is 
their dual match season. Coach Pinker-
ton would probably desire an entire 
season of tournaments, but that's just 
not the way the cookie crumbles. He's 
critically short of bodies to form a dual 
meet team. The next team to be up for 
UCSD is UC Riverside who come down 
this Thursday night. The match will be in 
the UCSD gym at 7:30 pm so if you're 
looking for a cheap date, its free, (how 
much cheaper can you get) take advan-
tage of this sport's event \ilnd go take a 
look at some fine wrestlers.

Hi 'chcock in 
L s Angeles 

Henry Stelmiln 

A week ago, I had the rare opportunity of meeting a 
man considere by many to be the finest film director 
of all time, Alfred Hitchcock. 

Mr. Hitchcock's personal appearance last weekend 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art launched 
what is to be a month long program covering 
Hitchcock's achievements in both television and mo-
tion picttfres. 

REAR WINDOW (1954) was the first film on the 
program. Actor Jimmy SStewart, who starred in the 
film, made a surprise appearance to introduce both the 
film and Mr. Hitchcock . After the film ended, Charles 
Champlin, film critic for the l.A. Times, conducted and 
hour long interview with liitchcock, which included a 
question and answer session with the audience. 

In discussing REAR WINDOW, Hitchcock described 
it as his "most purely visual film." It was an opportunity 
for him to do a strictly cinematic film . First, you have 
Stewart, immobil ized due to a broken leg, looking out 
his apartment window; secondly, the camera shows 
what Stweart sees, and thirdly, it shows how he reacts 
to. what he sees. 

B'ulbus and Beard 
Scott Anderson 

Heeeey keeds! There's no stopping it now .. . it's the 
Phlorescent Leech and Eddie! And they're gonna bop 
you on your beano with a replica brontosaurus! And if 
that doesn't shake up your laconic sock-tops kids, 
maybe the Chalice of Horror will wiggle your buns. 
Phlo and Eddie (Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman) 
have been using the rhythym method since they were 
choirboys. And now, after rising through fame in such 
groups as THE CROSSFIRES, THE TURTLES and THE 
MOTHERS OF INVENTION, Kaylan and Vol man are 
"Phlorsescent Leech and Eddie!" 

According to the Chicago Sun- Times, "This group is 
totally nuts." "This group" includes Don Preston, 
Aynsley Dunbar and Jm Pons (all of the Mothers) and 
Gary Rowles (formerly of Love) as well as Phlo and 
Eddie. 

These boys are as cute as cabbage heads and, given 
half a chance, will grease your eustachean tubes with 
vaseline harmonics WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY 
scratching your organs with honeyed gravel. Their 
audie nces all over the world have been thrown into a 
frenzy of catatonic hilarity and they always WANT 
MORE! in fact, on a recent tour through Europe with 

When asked about the relatively little dialogue in the 
film, Hitchcock stated that in his films, the dialogue is 
not as important to him as the visual presentation, and, 
therefore, it is the last thing written before the shooting 
of the film. 

As the Turtle in 1965 

Alice Cooper, they even managed to steal some 
headlines from him and/or her. 

" But we didn't try to. All we did was attempt to 
upstage Alice and outmug him." 

They give the credit where it's due, however: 
" Sometimes Alice can even beat us at TV Trivia." says 
Volman, a cacaphonous cache of carbohydrates. 

"Wer'e not afraid to play in any band. If any band 
would have us. Frank took the chance. And he's paying 
for it now with his career." "Hahal You see, everybody 
thinks Zappa is a tyrant . But he's not really. I am. He'd 
be noth ing if it wasn't for us. Frank, if you ever read

In the opening of REAR WINDOW, there Is a good 
example of how Hitchcock stresses the Importilnce of 
the visual, in this particular case, to convey to the 
audience the basic plot of the film. After panning 
across a series of apartment buildings, the camera 
slowly goes through a window into an apartment. Then 
there is a shot of Stewart in a wheel chair, followed by a 
close-up of one of his. legs in a cast. The camera then 
pans around the room, showing a series of shots: one 
close-up is of a broken camera; another is of pictures 
of racing cars, and another is of a stack of a particular 
magazine. In this one scene, the audience can already

" ... Flash ing brilliantly on several levels, like a 

diamond." 
"When do they sing 'Happy Together'?" 
"A great, titillating and original sound." 
"Which one is the fat guy?" 
As choir boys together, Phlo and Eddie learned 

charity. And now they're giving Zappa a big break, 
even if it means their reputation, with a chance to write 
a song for their new Broadway show, "Thirty Five 
Minutes From Shaboigan." "The sad story of a large 
white rat who comes to the City in search of comic 
garbage. And all he can find is a home in King County 
and four Melanie albums which he eats and dies." 

Of course Phlo and Eddie won't lose any momen-
tum during a performance with the disgusting and 
sadistic Zanzini Brothers. The Zeet Zanzinis will rudely 
commit cruel crimes with stuffed dogs and the front 
row audience. 

Sooo when January 27 rolls around, roll out of bed, 
roll your own and shake your lumbago with the 
Phlorescent Leech and Eddie! It's one of those things 
you've been looking for without even knowing it was 
lost.

figure out that the main character is a magazine 
photographer who broke his leg while covering an 
auto race, and you also know that because of his leg, he 
will be confined to his apartment for a whiile. 

In closing, Hitchcock went on to describe the art of 
montage (or cutting) in filmmaking. In giving an 
example of the importance of montage, he said, in 
REAR WINDOW you have a close-up of Stewart 
looking out his window at the apartment across the 
way. If you then cut and show Miss Lonely Hearts in her 
apartment, the audience would think that Stewart is a 
nice, sympathetic fellow: but 'if you take the same 
close-up of Stewart, and then cut to a shot of Miss 
Torso, well, then Stewart becomes a sex maniac. 

For those of you who are Hitchcock admirers or film
