Ronald Reagan has the edge 
over Pre ident Carter among 
regi tered UCSD tudent 
voters, reflecting a politically 
con ervative tudent body, a

Trailing well behind the 
other two major candidate is 
John Ander on, indicating 
that hi campaign here has 
only been partially succe sfu l 
in drawing student voters 
from the Carter and Reagan 
camp. 

The e result emerged 
from a telephone urvey 
condu cted Tue day night 
among 121 UCSD graduates 
and undergraduate, that 

howed Reagan with 34.3 
percent, Carter with 31 
percent and Ander on with 
23 percent of the tudent vote 
here. 

The UCSD figures for 
presidential preferences 
sharply contra t with 
preliminary figure gathered 
by UC Berkeley 's Daily 
Californian, which show orily 
16 percent of regi tered and 
non· registered student voter

for Reagan. 

Approximately 48 percent 
of students polled at UCB, in 
further contrast to UCSD, 
aid they will vote for Carter, 

while 20 percent said they 
will vote for Anderson. 

Pollees at UCSD were 
selected at random from a Ii t 
of registered UCSD students, 
and were contacted immedi· 
ately after Tuesday night' s 
pre idential debate between 
Carter and Reagan.

The AS Council last night 
rejected a bill that would 
have "not recognized" Randy

instead to form a ta k force to

Evangelists: left, right, or just religious' 
BY VICKI MONKS 

The loud pre·electlon 
hoopla over the spectre of a 
politicized new Christian 
Righi taking over Washing· 
ton will die hard, 

Even if it has not 
materialized, the idea is too 
attractive to too many people 
to just fade away: 30 to 60 
million Born Again Christ· 
ian!l, thinking with a single 
mind and intent on imposing 
an ultra · con s ervative 
program on America, 

For the advocates of such a 
movement, the myth is more 
important than the reality, 
For the detractors, the 
spectre will remain a useful 
object of fear , Few will profit 
from the realization that the 
"evangelical bloc" is fraught 
with fractures, 

Consider Larry Jones, a 
bellowing, Bible·thumping 
Born Again preacher, An 
Oklahoma evangelist, he 
opens his Sunday moming 
sermon on the Christian 
Broadcasting Network with a 
tirade against the evils of the 
ERA, asserting the amend· 
ment has a rider which would 
give homosexuals equal 
rights and allow them to 
teach in the public schools, 

But then he ~ on to 
other issues, "RIch Christ· 
ians are literally rap'ing 
Third World countries, ' he 
declares, "They go into poor 
countries and pay workers a 
dollar a day just because they 
can get away with it, and 
that's wrong, There's got to 
be some more equal 
distribution, " 

On foreign policy: "Our

vote for anyone because "no 
candidate represents what 
Jesus stood for," even though 
all three pres ident i al 
contenders are self·avowed 
Born Again Christians. 

"A lot of Christians see no 
hope in the political system at 
all ," Hess contends, "Their

of God.' 

The evident diversity in 
the ranks of this Christian 
army is borne out by the 
pollsters who have studied 
them. 

Nationally, the Gallup Poll 
concluded that nearly one· 
fifth of the US population 
(about 30 million) may be 
described as "evangelicals," 
meaning they have had a 
"born again" experience, 
they evangelize others -and 
believe in a literal interpre· 
tation of the Bible, 

Dreams of Chicano youth fade when schools fail 
Allison Engel "'role this for 

Ihe Pacific News Service. 
BY ALLISON ENGEL 
PITTSBURG, CA. -

Angry Chicano high school 
students and their parents 
organized a school boycott 
here last week, charging 
teachers and administrators 
with racism. The incident 
that touched off the boycott 
wasn't in it self very 
~ignificant.' bu~ the underly· 
109 motivation was: a 
profround frustration over 
the quality of education that 

minorities are receiving. 
''I'd say that maybe one out 

of 20 Chicano kids here will 
do something with his life," 
said sophomore Ruben 
Rosales, "The other 19 will 
stay in Pittsburg, maybe 
work in the steel mill, hang 
out or do something they 
don't want to do. Most of us 
want to go to college, and 
have dreams of doing things, 
but for most kids, they are 
pretty much just dreams." 

As this town and others 
like it t h the 

transformation from a heavy 
industrial community to a 
bedroom suburb of San 
Francisco, and people of color 
who live here have watched 
the low·skilled but well 
paying jobs disappear. The 
rapid exodus of those jobs, 
combined with the arrival of 
affluent commuters, have 
produced a service economy 
that offers unskilled jobs for 
poor pay - fast food service, 
dishwashers , waiters , 
janitorial workers.

dead end world is through 
education, And so, when they 
feel the schools have failed 
them, the young people feel 
that all has failed, The rug 
has been pulled out from 
under them, and they look 
down into a dark pit. 

"We were taught to respect 
authority and respect our 
elders," said the 15·year-old 
Chicano youth earnestly , 
"It's not in our nature to 
boycott. 

"We had to, We had to get 
the school board to listen to 
us, The school, in so many 
ways, doesn't help us at all , 
We're getting no guidance 
toward coll~e or any careers 
that matter, ' 

The boycott, which 
involved hundreds of 
students and lasted for three 
days, was touched off by a 
Chicano football player 
getting kicked off the team 
for possession of a bottle of 
champagne, But students 
and their parents al so had 
broader complaints, such as 
Chicano students not being 
adequately prepared to take 
college preparatory classes, 
Too many Chicano students 
end up in the ge neral 

education track, do poorly, 
drop out or are sent to a 
special "continuation" high 
school, they said. There, 
struggling students are 
offered even less education, 
since classes meet only half a 
day, 

"They aren't being 
prepared for anything," said 
Sandra Valle, the mother of 
the football player kicked off 
the team, ". know a lot of kids just hanging around after 
they graduate." 

The boycott, an editorial in 
the local newspaper pointed 
out, "serves to illustrate the 
complete frustration Pitts-
burg Hispanics are feeling 
concerning the education of 
their children." 

Ruben Rosales said two 
Chicano brothers graduated 
at t he top of their class 
several years ago and went on 
to medical school, "but since 
then, I don't know of anyone 
who's really done some· 
thing," 

The concern over the 
quality o( education for 
Chicanos goes far beyond this

Tritons split two games in LA

Slaff Wril cr 
The watcrpolo team split a pairof games in Los Angeles las t 

weekend despite a dense blanket of smog which hamper d t h 
team's play. 

The Tritons overcam t he pollutants, which were a tougher 
opposition than t he human oPlxments, in the t he fir~t game as 
they shut-out a weak Loyola-Marymount t am 14-0. 

Unfort unmcly UCSD did not fare a~ well in the se 'ond 
game against a powerful Cal taiL' LA Uni versity squad. The 
com binat ion of smog and un-forced errors proved too much for 
Ihe Tritons as they succ;umberl to the Oiablos 11 -19. 

During the past few years it has bccomealmost routine for 
Cal State to win a close first game, and t hen the Tritons mille

Chicano 
dreams 
conti nued from page 2 
this country's most under-
educated minority. While 67 
percent of white youths and 

7 

-16 percent of black youths 
fini sh high school, only 40 
percent of Chicanos gradu· 
ate. 

Minorily youth also are 
giving birt h to more children 
I han t heir white cou nler-
parts, leading to crowded 
scho()l~ in di~tricts wil h high 
minority enrollments at the 
same time surburban schools 
are closing for lack of 
stud llls. In Los Angeles, for 
example, while 20 percent of 
the \'ot ing-age popu I at ion is 
Chicano, the percentage of 
Chicanos in kindergarten in 
50 perc nt. 

Sch(x)1 officials deny that 
they discriminate aga inst 

hiccmos."We have one of 
t he best affirmat ive acl ion 
programs anywhere," said 

uperin tendent Bob Rot h -
child . He point out that the 
district is well integrated: 30 
percent black, 20 percent 
Chicano, 9 percent Asian 
(moe!!y Filipino) and about 
40 percent white, "This 
represents the' real world. I 
really believe tudents have 

. an opportunity here to live 
and grow in a really 
pluralistic communit y," 

He sa id that people of color 
are lightlyover·represented 
in the continuation high 

chool. but he thinks 
Chicano over tate the 
problem, For example, he 
said, some Chicano students 
claim teachers have struck 
them in cia s, "It's not a 
racial thing - it's a teacher 
losing control. " 

Roth child blamed last 
week's boycott on "outside 

~tators" and said it was a 
disservice to pull s tudents 
out of chool. " If they want a 
better education, they should 
be in class," 

Asked why st udents who 
do poorly are sent to a school 
that meets only a few hours a 
day, Rothschild replied , 
"Three hours doe n't make it 
less of an education . For 
many students, it's all they 
can handle." 

Some parents don 't see it 
that way. One is Maria Elena 
Hernandez. Her oldest son, 
Ruben , was one of the 
students who said a teacher 
hit him. Two weeks ago, the 
school solved the problem 
between Ruben and the 
teacher by sendin~ Ruben to 
work in his parent s Mexican 
restaurant during the class 
period and giving him school 
credit for it.

Rally features 
SAAC speakers 
continued from pale 1 
to criticize both Tom Metzger 
and Clair Burgener , 
candidates for Congress in 
the 43rd district. 

Alavos called the choice 
between Metzger and 
Burgener "a choise between 
death and s lavery ," 
especially concerning their 
stance on US-Mexican border 
policy_ 

"It does not mat ter who is 
elected, (president), the 
Indians won't get a fair deal," 
said Morrow in his address_ 

Morrow went on to discuss 
such issues as a water bill , 
that if passed , will send 
government subsidies to the 
utilities that supply water_ 

He said that the political 
system has made "an 
economic commodity out of 
our basic needs." 

Morrow advocated a bill 
that would earmark tax 
money for t he purchase of 
land to be used as parks, 
including land in the Lake 
Tahoe region . 

LaRoya ca lled for a 
stronger commitment to the 
recruitment of Asia n 
American students by the 
Education Opportunity 
Program. He aid that of the 
few that were recruited, 
orne could have come to 

UCSD without any help from 
E.O.P. 

"They are wast ing money 
on people that don 't need the 
help," LaRoya said, adding 
that there is a need for an 
Asian studies program on 
campus. 

The final speaker at the 
hour-long rally wa Tricia 
Nelson. Her talk centered on 
theimportanceofthcpa age 
of the Equal Right s 
Amendment. 

"Should only half of the 
voters have their right s 

.protected by the law ?" 
Nelson asked. She al 0 
discussed the importance of a 
woman' free choice in 
regard to abortion, along 
with freedom from sexual 
harrasment at work.

"Basically, we sell them 

becau e Marcy (another core 
member) uses them," core 
member Bob Corlew said. 
"She' s never had any 
problems with them." 

The sponges at the store 
come with instructions and 
sell for $1.43 each. 

"There has been a large 
demand for ponges for a 
year, (and) no one has been 
able to get them," Corlew 
aid . "Now we have a 

source ... so we're selling 
them."

The sponges old at the 
General Store are di st ributed 
by the Medicine Wheel Herb 
and Healing Collective, 
which also upplie several 
other location in the San

bacteria and tuff can be 
avoided by just boiling them
