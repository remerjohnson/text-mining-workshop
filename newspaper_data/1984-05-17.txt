Center referendunt's 
nearly $6,000 budget 
goes to organizations 

Next week's referendum for the proposed $12 million-plus Student Center 
WIll COSt about $6,000: a budget geared to involve both undergraduate and 
graduate students in the votmg process. 
. In addition to brochures describing the project, computer balloring and 

miscellaneous costs, the Student Center Board has also decided to pay $1 ,500 to 
various student organizations and an additional $450 to individuals. 

According to Tom Tucker, committee chairman, the paid individuals are 
"expending an enormous amount of effort to run the election ." 

Bm Ansell ran the recent AS election and the Student Center Board has 
chosen him to run this one. 

Ansell ran the AS election for free in the capacity of elections commissioner, 
but is receiving $150 for this ballot. He couldn't afford to run this one for free 
because the amount of time required for the last one caused his grades to suffer, 
he saId. 

Four individuals are receiving $75 for their efforts as well . 
According to Ansell , the money for organizations is needed to get sufficient 

manpower to operate the polls, although previously, special elections were run 
by volunteers. 

"T hese organizations volunteered their time in the AS election, but we can't 

Tom Tucker, vice chancellor of the Student Center. 

get them to do it for free this time," Ansell said. 'Their friendliness is all used 
up." 

The referendum budget limits the payment of organizations to $1,500. 
If an organization contributes a specified amount of time (about 50 man-

hours), it will automatically receive a maximum of about $300. 
Running the booths will require 350 man-hours, Ansell said . 
According to Ansell , ASIO, SAM, PLEA, Circle K, EMSA, Model UN and all the 

fraternities and sororities have been approached to work the booths, but the 
actual list of workers has not been fina lized. 

Fifteen thousand copies of an informational brochure, which describes all 
aspects of the proposed Student Center, have been produced ata cost of$2,500. 

Tucker has heard some informal complaints about the cost of the brochures. 
He defends the production of high quality pamphlets: "When it comes to 
students, we try to do everything as high quality as we can." 

The brochure includes a sample of the referendurn , a list of the facilities to be 
prOVided by the Center and answers to some of the commonly-asked questions 
concerning the project. 

All but about 2,000 of the brochures have been distributed so far, Tucker said . 
People have been , and will continue , operating information booths around 

campus. In addition to the brochures, Student Center representatives are 
available to answer questions about the Center. 

Action Compute Corporation (ACC), the company responSible fo r the AS 
elections ballots, will handle the balloting for this referendum at a cost of $700. 

In addition to providing 10,000 ballots, ACC wilt do the computer counting 
after collecting the ballots. 

The Student Center Board has spent $640 on advertising in the Guardian , 
while Guardran advertiSing for the AS elections was $800, Posters and other 
promotional media have also been spread around campus. More than $200 will 
be spe nt on miscellaneous costs .

UC student fee reductions 
pass subcommittee 
By JACKIE AFFONSO 
Sacramento Correspondent 

The enate Fi nance Subcommittee 
voted to reduce UC student fees by an 
add itional $30 on Tuesday, to ensure 
the contllluauon of student fee poltcy 
negotiations. 

Combllled with the Governor's 
proposed $70 fee reduction, the 
subcommittee's action would resull in a 
$100 student fee decrease for the 1984-
85 academtc year. 

This further reduction of student fees 
means the entire student fee issue will 
now be discussed between members of 

both houses in conference commi ttee 
hearings. 

The bask fee policy, requested by the 
Legislative Analyst'S olTi ce, outlines a 
"fee-setting mechanism" which 
determines the amount of money an 
individual student should pay for 
instruCtion based on a three-year 
average of sta te general fund support for 
education , 

The fe e policy presented to the 
Senate subcommittee by its staff, after 
negotiations including UC budget 

offiC ials and the UC tudent Lobby, 
combined a further student fee 
reduction with the removal of a defined 
maxImum student fee level. The 
ubcommlttec denied its suppOrt of the 

policy after negative testimony by the 
Department of Fmance and the UC 
Student Lobby. 

The UC tudent Lobby had proposed 
a maximum limit on student fees per 
year during the negotiations, UC 
Student Lobby Director Ron Balestrieri 
said. He was concerned that a decrease 

Faculty salary increases approved 
By JACKIE AFFONSO 
Sacramento Correspondent 

UC faculty salary increases, the 
University'S highest budget priori ty, 
were approved by both Assembly and 
Senate budget subcommittees last week. 

If the subcommittees' actions remam 
consistent with the Governor's proposed 
1984-85 budget, over the next two 
months faculty salaries will increase 
12.8%. 

itself more acceSSIble to women and 
minorities by providing child care 
facilities on all campuses and special 
summer fellowships for minorities, 
among orher things. 

The subcommittee, howeve r, was nor 
satisfied wi th the University 'S 
accomplishments and also asked for a 
report on women and mlllority staff 
development programs. 

University'S recent comparable worth 
study "indicated a totalla k of 
understanding of the Issue." 

The $4.7 rnillton would be given to 
the ulllon and distributed to UC staff 
through a collective bargaming process. 

Unlike the Assernblr, the enate 
subcommittee passed the faculty salary 
Increases with little dISCUSSIOn . Members 
of both houses will meet in a conference 
committee to resolve the additional 
requests of the Assembly subcommittee. 

III next year's fees, under the staffs 
policy, was not a faIr "trade-off' for the 
loss of control over future fee IIlcreases. 

"I don't think the staff 
recommenda tions accurately renected aU 
of the negotiations that went on," he 
said . 

talf consultant to the subcomm Ittee 
Dan Wall said he removed the cap on 
lees to "stimulate them I students I to 
negotiate ." Wall said that some SOrt of a 
compromIse will have to be made on 
thIS issue, 

UllIversity budget offiCials testified tn 
suppOrt of fee policies presented m 
both subcommittees. UC ASSIstant VIce 
PreSIdent and Director of the Budget 
Larry Hershman saId , "We are wilting to 
work with everybody we need to for a 
long-term fee policy. It 's very hard to get 
all these different parties to agree to 
something." 

Balestrieri said he believed the 
Governor might accept another fee 
red uction, and is optimistiC that the 
Senate would approve it. 

He said , however, the Assembly would 
not be as supportive due to the lack of 
state funding allocated to community 
colleges. 

Senator icholas Petris (D-Oakland) 
expressed his commitment to lowering 
fees and finding a SUitable fee policy. 
He said the cost of attending UC should 
nor equal thar of private schools. 

The subcommittee's action, proposed 
by Senator Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) was 
taken primarily to avoid duplica ting 
Assembly subcommittee action on the 
fee policy taken Monday, he said . 

The Assembly subcommittee, whIch 
had voted for a 570 fee reduction 
ea rlier, also denied ItS support for a 
long-term fee poltcy presented by the 
Legislative Analyst Monday. 

Faculty would receive 9% of the 
increase on july 1, 1984, and the 
add itional 3.8% on january I , 1985, The 
increase places UC faculty salaries above 
those at comparable institutions, 
accord ing to a California Postsecondary 
Educauo;,\ CommISSIOn study released 
last month .. 

Although both subcommittees 
approved the ~alary increases, the 
Assembly subcommittee attached some 
trings. 

At the suggestion of Assemblyman 
Larry Stirling (R-La Mesa). who 
abstai ned from the vote, the 
subcommittee agreed no state money 
would be aUocated for faculty salaty 
increases until the University submitted 
a report to the Legislature detailing the 
essentials of a PhD for the purpose of 
teaching at Uc. The report is due 
january 1, L985. 

In addition to the twO studies, 
subcommittee members requested that 
the Universi ty submit another 
comparable worth study and augment 
the budget by $4.7 million as 
compensation to female staff employees 
who hJve been . receiving less money 
than males in Slfllliar jobs. The stud), is 
due December I , 1984. 

American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees officials, 
represenrlllg 30,000 UC staff employees, 
told subcommittee members the 

Militant Jewish org. 
plans UCSD branch 

Reacting to the subcommittee's action, 
UC Assistant Vice President and 
Director of the Budget Larry Hershman 
said, "We are obviouslYJleased about 
the dollars ." He also sai the University 
was relieved that the enate 
subcommittee approved the increases as 
proposed by the Governor. 

Stirling's request was the outcome of a 
tense debate focusmg on University 
women and minority recruitment and 
promotion practices. Stirling was nor 
sa tisfied with UC Academic Vice 
President William Frazer's explanation 
of UCs hiring and tenure procedures. 

Frazer sa id the UniverSIty hires vety 
few faculty members witholU PhDs. UCs 
promotion criteria consist of a 
committee review of a faculty member's 
teach ing, research, University and 
public service accomplishments, he said . 

tirling said fa ulty pr motion 
should bc measured by thei r students' 
accompl ishments, and IIldividuals 
without PhDs are capable of teachlllg 
many UllIver It)' courses. 

"They're not evaluated 0 11 results, but 
('ertam folklore that shows they're a part 
01 rhe tealll," tirling saId. 

frazer told the subcommittee 
members there are Illore women bCLIlty

removmg an unfavorable attitude toward 
them whICh eXlsu::d 20 years ago.

By PAUL lAZERSON 
A new, more militant jewish student 

organiza tion has been formed at Sa n 
Diego State University this year and 
plans to branch out to UCSD for the 
academic year 1984-85. The jewish 
Action Committee is a subsidiary of the 
long-established jewish Student union at 
SDSU, but its philosophies and plans for 
action are quite different than its parent 
organization. 

The jAC claims an active membership 
of 30 to 35 at State out of the more than 
500 people on the umbrella 
organiza tion's mailing list. Leader Marc 
Annis, a se nior majoring in political 
science, said he had started the group 
as a reaction agai nst the "bagels and lox 
JudaIsm" he sees as being prevalent 
within the already-established j ewish 
student organizations. 

"The jewish Student Union in the 
past has been mostly a social 
organization. We believe there are a I t 
of stude nts out there who want to be 
active in a more meanmgful way than 
JUSt dancmg and singing songs," said 
Annis. "There are a lot of important 
issues that pertatn to the JeWIs h people, 
and we want to give those students who 
want to be involved an organization 
where they can do it." 

peaking out and demonstrating 
about the pltght of oppre sed jewry tn 
the oviet Unton, vanou Arab countries 
and Ethi oplU is hIgh on the JACs II t of 
priorities. They ee the "offiCIal 
spokespeople" of the jewish community 
as relying toO much on quiet dIplomacy 
and nor enough on dIrect a tlon . 

For Hoi CJU t Remembrance day, 
Annt and me 12 other members of 

the group picketed against what they 
feel is the soft treatment many ex-Nazis 
have received in this country. They were 
successful in terms of the media: the 
San Diego Union covered their 
demonstration . 

-We are willing to go out on the 
streets," Annis commented , "Wendy 
lone of the members I and 1 went into 
Walts and held a rally against jesse 
jackson. We had a Heros Day where he 
commemorated the deaths of j ews who 
gave their lives trying to save their 
brothers and sisters." 

Annis is extremely well ve rsed in 
modem JeWIsh history as was his 
counterpart Wendy Madnick, a junior at 
State majoring in journalism. They are a 
good-looking pair, both tanned and 
athletic. The biggest problem they face 
is apathy, but the responses they have 
gorten over this past year seem to have 
strengthened thei~ resolve to continue. 

About Israel, they take what would be 
called a hard-hne attitude by eIther 
I raeli or American standards. AnI1lS 
suggests that Israel should provide 
compensation for We t Bank Arabs for 
the purpose of haVi ng them leave the 
area. "Populauon transfers are nor 
unheard of 111 hIStory," Annis said. 
"When Israel was formed , almo tone 
Illilhon jews from Arab lands were made 
refugees and I rael took them in," 

Up to now, mainstream Jewish 
organi zations have accepted and 
worked with the JA to ome extent. 
That cooperation will probably be tCMed 
next year when the jAC seeks to expand 
Jnd enlarge its activi ties.

What's in a name? 
After 15 years , Third College is finally getting 

around to finding a name. Its moniker-absence in the 
past has been a distressing situation, as one would 
sooner have realized if one's parents went about 
referring to one as "First Child" or "Fourth Child." 

Actually there have been previous attempts to 
bestow on Third something more than numerality. 
Many, many years ago, almost as many years as 
certain left-wing individuals have been students at 
this campus, Martin Luther King College was 
suggested . But black militantism, or militant blackism, 
was on the rise , and suddenly it seemed little better 
than Uncle Tom College. Martin Luther King was 
abandoned and Lumumba-Zapata was taken up. 

Lumumba-Zapata was not the possessor of an 
upper-class English hyphenated name, but rather he 
was two people . But even then, Lumumba was going 
down not even in infamy but in obscurity. Now, 
probably very few students even at Third could tell 
you who he was, why he died and where . 

Besides, that would have been an unfair advantage 
over the other colleges, possessors of a Single name. 
To restore equality, one would leave the door open to 
Revelle-Lee and Warren-Peace. One current 
suggestion of King-Kennedy is no better: Drop the 
hyphen , and you would not surprise many 
Republicans. 

Gandhi is another suggestion, but it should have 
been suggested sooner after the movie . Celluloid 
popularity recedes quickly. Unity is a popular one , 
bur it sounds like a bible college , or at least a 
theological school. The full Martin Luther King, Jr. 
College c reates similar confusion on the institution's 
status. 

As usual , there is a certain appeal in the status quo , 
and the official name could very well be voted in as 
Third College , a t least for a few more years until 

people get tired of the name, or lack of name again. 
But it proves at least that some Third College 
students have a sense of tradition. 

Then there is Angela Davis College, which is 
strange, because Armin Rappaport, who as the 
planner probably did much more for it than she did, 
has not been suggested, even with the advantage that 
he has passed away and she might always be visiting 
us. 

Perhaps the course least fraught with decision and 
difficulties is to give the other three colleges back 
their numbers, although not necessarily in the order 
they originally had. Each year we could rank them in 
accordance with their population , or the greatest 
number of honors students. Then, at least, there 
would be some competition among the colleges. Our 
permanent signs could be replaced by easily changed 
digital displays, scorecards, if you will , or even if you 
won't. 

In addition, we could abandon geographical 
nomenclature and number our campuses one through 
nine . Among the nation's universities , the University 
of California would of course be number one. In this 
age of technological illiteracy, we could at least give 
our students the advantage of being able to count. 
Third College is ahead of its time . 

Or the number could increase with every year the 
college is without a name, thus making it Fifteenth 
College. When we reach an advanced and 
respectable dotage, like Cambridge, Oxford or 
Harvard , we would not have to advertise it. 

But this is off the main purpose, which is inertia. 
It is inertia that has kept Third College a Cipher for 
a decade and a half, whatever the supposed 
connection of the number to the Third World or any 
other Threes. This article cannot advoca te any 
particular name, but then any name would be nice.

Editor: 

Since~ly, 
Nmro Ennui 

The discussion about AS Council 
stIpends has come to a frant ic peak. I'm 
very happy that it has. In spri ng quarter 
of 1 Q83, when stipends were a 
referendum issue, I decided how I felt 
about the issue when I read the 
question at the polls, voting against 
sti pends. I wish this debate could have 
occurred then , because I would have 
voted differently. I would have voted for 
stipends. 

The arguments for stipends are quite 
convincing. Stipends would open 
student government to those who work, 
who cannot afford to put in the full-time 
dedication needed to be a member of 
Council. 

Stipends will finally provide the stick 
that will keep those elected [0 council 
working for the student body. An 
evaluation board consisting of interested 
students will strengthen the check on 
the Council. The student body will have 
the opportunity to keep the Council 
accountable. 

Some arguments advanced against 
stipends have been that the Council 
shouldn't give "themselves" stipends and 
that the money will just come out of 
someone else's budget. Well, anyone 
familiar with AS finances knows that we 
have enough money to give Council 
these incentives, that no one's budget 
will be cut for stipends. Our budget is 
such that the current Council allocates 
funds for the period of its own term of 
office. This is exactly what the student 
body endorsed when the AS was 
created, and this is what the student 
body entrusted the current Council the 
power to do. 

The debate which took place during 
, the election was imponant. The sides 
were cleady drawn and in the head-tO-
head matchups , those in favor of 
stipends won . This vote of the students 
was just the beginning of the debate. 
The input of all students is needed and 
this council will be looking forward to 
hearing from you. 

Editor: 

Sincerely, 
Michael S. Goodheim 

AS Financ~1 Controller 

1 would like to begin by saying what a 
fine, fine publication the Guardian is, 
and that it is staffed by wonderful, 

caring people . I would like to go on 
record as saying that [ am one hundred 
percent behind it in every way. 

I am, however, somewhat 
dumbfounded by the process of 
application for editorsh ip at the 
Guardian. [ read the rules and am 
confused on a number of points , to wit: 

I. If I don't have a typewriter, can I 
still be an edttor? [t says that aU 
applications must be typewritten. Do I 
have to have a cenain typewriter? [f 1 
use a Smith Corona, will [ be considered 
over someone who used a Selectric? 

2. What is considered "qualified"? 
Must I have worked on a major 
metropolitan daily, or is the fact that I 
am breathing enough? 

3. It says thaI I must be responsible , 
organized, mature and reliable. If 
needed, I can get my mother to send in 
a leller or get a Signed affidavit to insure 
that I am such a person. ActuaUy, how 
many people have all of the above 
attributes (other than the fine staffers at 
the Guardian , of course)? If I am 
extremely reliable but only slightly 
organized, can the attribute cover for my 
failings? Am I applying for Editor or 
Pope? Does it matte.t if I am a virgin? 
What about my sexual preference? 

4. It says that a person can be an 
elector to vote for editors. It also says 
that such people must submit a letter of 
intent. Would it be wrong to submit a 
lener of intent stating that I want to vote 
because I read the thing?' What are the 
qualifications? If they are the same as 
for being an editor, shouldn't I II)' to be 
an editor instead? Do my looks count, 
or the way 1 dress? I have lots of money, 
if that matters. 

5. It says that I can make up my own 
position. I would like to submit myself 
for the position of making up the front 
page. I can get designs from all over the 
campus, from copy cameras (see last 
issue) to Q-Bert machines. I can do it. I 
swear. I'm responsible - I've never had 
an overdue library book. 

6. Can I apply for business manager? 
I hear talk that such a position might be 
opening up soon. 

That's about all I have to say. I hope 
that you'll get back to me soon on th is , 
but I promise I won't caU you guys. I'm 
slJre you're aU very busy pUlling the 
paper together and thinking up house 
ads and making sure that no letters get 
primed under the wrong names or 
anything. By the way, my name is 
Michael Ahn . That's M-I-C-H-A-E-L A-H-
N. I can be found in the book. The 
telephone book, that is. 

Take care and God bless you all , 
especially the responsible, organized , 
mature and reliable editorial stafr.

In thiS season of the California RCVIL'W,

on thiS umverslty's "Intellectual"

vis-a-vIs the nation sterns from the 
eXistence and continuance of a plurality 
of Ideas; its free-flow of rnnovauve 
theory and polemiC are ItS hfeblood. 

Tocqueville views the plurality of Ideas 
as invaluable, for "the fewer the 
opposing points of View, the greater 
men experience a loss of individuality; 
they let themselves glide with the stream 
of the crowd because they find it hard 
to niamtam alone an opinion held by

Third College: 
didn't make the official list. Fewer than 100 people 
showed up for the assembly, but more than enough 
emotion was present. Some students voiced their 
displeasure that the final ballots had already been 
mailed out before there was a chance for them to 
diSCUSS possible alternatives. There were also 
complaints that many Third College stude nts, bOth on 
and off campus, never received an origmal naming 
baUot and never knew that a renaming was even takrng 
place. 

To rename or not to rename 
By PHIL WILLON 
"What 's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other 
na me would smell as sIVeet." 

Shakespeare has obviously not been to Third College 
lately. For the fou rth time mover J 2 yea rs, the 
students on that northern campus are again trying to 
find an o ff,WI I name. 

The presenr title of "Thi rd" has been temporary 
stnce the college originated in J 972 and stands for 
nothing more than that campus being the third one 
built. Now the studenrs have decided they want a 
certified name, somethtng to give them an "air of 
permanence," as one person put It. The top three 
suggestions made by students thus far include Unity 
College, Ktng College (for Martin Luther King, jr.) and 
the original temporary name, Third College. 

"It's not so much changing the name as it IS trying 
to get an official name," said Harnet Happel , 
chairperson of the Third College CouncIl's 
subcommittee that is handling the renamrng. 

At the beginning of the year, the Third College 
Council listed the naming of Its campus as top 
prrori ty. To make Third students aware of thiS 
important issue, the Council sent out a senes of 
newsleHers explamtng Third's hl~tOry, current goals 
,md philosophies, and a ballot givi ng them an 
opportu ni ty to suggest pOSSible names. There was also 
a general assembly held last Tuesday to discuss the 
three student choices and to bnng up other 
possibilities. Voting for the final name will begin this 
week when Third students receive their ba llots in the 
mail. 

The Third College provost, Faustina Solis, along with 
the full council (students and faculty) will take into 
consideration the students' choice along with that of 
the Third College faculty and staff and then make a 
recommendation to Chancellor Richard Atkinson's 
University Naming Committee. The committee in turn 
advises the chancellor, and if he suppOrtS the 
proposed name it goes to the UC Regents for final 
approval. There is a slim chance that a new name 
could be arrived at by next fall . 

Some of the Other suggestions h -ought up by 
students and faculty, and which a e still eligible as 
write-ins on the final ballot, are F~ ;derick Douglas, Dr. 
Charles Drew, King-Kennedy, Unite'd, Third World , 
Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt and Tercer Mundo. 

Fainr traces of Third's past surfaced when a few 
students suggested the names Angela Davis and 
Lumumba-Zapata . Davis' name was disqualified 
because of the University poiicy of only using the 
names of deceased individuals when naming a college 
after a person. 

It was in 1969 that activist Angela Davis, along with 
the Black Student Council and the Mexican YOllth 
Association , had the dream of creating a college for the 
community, later to be known as Third. It was to 
provide students, regardless of color, the ability to 
analyze and address the contemporary social issues of 
the time. The name Lumumba-Zapata stood for 
celebrated African and Mexican leaders that could 
represent the fight for racial freedom Third would be 
built around . The controverSial name was never 
adopted, and the original intentions of the college 
have a ll since faded away. 

"The means to achieve change have changed ," 
commented Happel when comparing rhe tranquil 
student mood of today to the heated past. "It's not so 
much a switch as a maturity process .. 

The last attempt IJy Third College to get a 
permanent name was III 1979. Lumumba-Zapata was a 
contender, but was killied by the tudent CounCil and 
lhen Third College Provost Joe Watson , who called the 
name "inappropriate ." 

That renamrng campa ign five years ago is very 
similar in some regards to the present one. The 
stude nts' tOp twO choices wcre "Third" an "King," 
neither of which ever made It to the Regents. Also 
Similar to '79 is the lack of student participation rn the 
suggestion process. Back then . only 103 students OUI of 
1,660 vOted on the ballot; in thiS >'ear's campaign, a 

little over 100 students out of 2,300 bothered to vote. 
The three names that will appear on the final ba llot 
onl y received a combined total of 66 vOtes. 

About the pOSSibility of there being a poor turnout of 
Third College voters for voti ng on the final name, 
Provost Solis said, "If I feel there IS not adequate 
representation , I would not recommend a name I to the 
Chancellor]." In that case, the drive to get an official 
name would end. 

"!t's almost as if not voting is a vote for keeping 
things the way they are ," commented John Stewart, 
chairman of the University Naming Committee. 

Edward Lee, chairman of the Third College Council , 
feels that it is important for his campus to get an 
official name. "I hope students are aware of what's 
coming up ," he said, and added that a good name will 
give his school "more stability" and a "clari fication of 
our goals." Lee also commented that the whole 
renaming process is revi talizi ng the college's past 
commitment "for all races to corne together and work 
together." 

Last Tuesday night there was an open diSCUSSion 
held on the names already favored (Third, King and 
Unity) as well as comments made on those name thar 

Happ~l assured thal all those off-campus students 
with current addresses at the Reglslrar's Officc were 
mailed ballots, as were all Third students living on 
campus. When asked why some students claimed they 
never received anything, Happel replied , "We don't 
know what happened . We can't personally take i.l to 
2.300 stLldents." 

For the actual naming of the college, there was a split 
on whether the school should be named after an 
indiVidual of a concept. 

I amtng the college after Martrn Luther KlIlg. Jr .. 
Simply caUrng It King College, as the first pOSSibility 
discusses ja>' Richard , a Third College RA spoke rn 
favor of the name: "Martin Luther KlIlg really does 
kind of embody what I personally feel the college 
stands for in terms of unity, the working together of all 
mces, our three-hand symbol. .. the activeness of all 
people." Many other students felt the same wa)', saytng 
the name had high credibility and an obVIOUS 
representation of what Third 's philosophies are. 

Some students were apprehensive about naming 
their college after a man who fought pnmanly for 
blacks. One student said , "The other ethnic groups on 
this campus might feci left OUt as far as their struggles 
heing represented." Also pOinted out was the hmitation 
of one individual standing for everything Third does; 
students said thiS could never be done , no matter 
whom the person was. 

Although the name "Third College" has nothtng but 
a numerical meaning, over the >'ears, people began to 
connect l[ with the Third World . Many students want 
to keep the name because it's so familiar. In an earlier 
effort to name the cam pus, "Third" was chosen by the 
students but then rejected by the naming committee for 
reasons that were explained by Professor Edward 
Reynolds: "The name was rejected because some 
people fel t that in a few years ' time there would be 
people who had a be tter notion of whal the college 
represented," and that the temporaty name of "Third" 
was used because "it was a name that people could not 
identify with , a name without any dignity." 

Peter Kim was one of the leaders of Third College 
that thought up and pushed for the name "Unity." "We 
wa nted to have an adjective that described what Third 
College meant .. .. It 's a word that represents what we

The name was not as popular with the crowd on 
hand . "U nity I assoCiate With religion, and that would 
JUSl turn people off," one outspoken student charged. 
Others felt it was tOO vague and bland. 

As for other suggestions, Dr. Philip Raphael, lhe 
clinical psychologist for Third College, made a strong 
convincing argument for Frederick Douglas. He read a 
moving quote from Douglas that seemed to have made 
a few students in the room change their minds on the 
name they wanted for the campus. 

Other top suggestions were for King-Kennedy and 
Dr. Charles Drew. Drew was the Black doctor who 
developed plasma aild who later bled to death because 
he was not allowed in a hospital that didn't help 
blacks. 

Third College students should be receiving their 
ballots shortly, and If they do not, they are encouraged 
to pick one up al the dean's office . Happel warned 
that if there IS a small turnout of voters all may be 10 t: 
"If it does nOt go over lhls time . It never will ."

Explosive mechanics 
authority, lecturer 

Dr Che-Min Cheng, president of the 
Inslltute of Mechanics of the Chmese 
Academy of -clence In Peking and one 
of the world 's leading authonues on 
explosive mechanics, Will serve as a 
Regents Lecturer at UCSD nex t week. 

Cheng. whose friends call hlln Jimm} 
will deliver a se ries of technical lectures 
and one public lecture dunng his stay. 
The technical lectures a re all scheduled 
for 4 pm in Room 7104 of Urey Hall or 
the Reve lle College campus. The 
scheduled lectures are: Monday, t\tay 2l 
- "Mechanics of High Speed 
Deforma tion"; Tuesday, May 22 - "Gas 
Bursts in Coal Mines"; Tuesday, May 29 
- "Stability Problems AsSOCiated Wllh 
High Speed Deformation"; and Monday, 

June .. - "Application of on-Local 
Theory of Continuum Mechanics to 
Fracture" 

The public lec!llre is scheduled for 8 
pm Tuesday, May 29 in the Garren 
Auditorium in the BaSIC Science 
BUilding at the chool of Medlcme. 
Cheng Will talk on "Openmg of Ch ina's 
West and the Use of Explosion 
Mechanics " 

Che ng, born in Jinan, China, 
graduated from Tsinhua University In 
Peking in 1947. He came to the United 
)tates one year later to study at the 
California Institute of Technology and , 
while at Caltech , worked on eanhquake 
engineering. After geuing his PhD in 
1952, Cheng worked on problems of 
vibrations induced by now in pipelines. 
He helped to solve the problem of 
vibration in the pumps of the Grand 
Coulee Dam on the Columbia River m 
Washington and made extensive 
contribut ions to the problems of 
designi ng structures to resist shocks. 

After his return to Chma In 1955, 
Cheng taught at Ts inhua University 
before Jointng the Institute of 
Mathematics and , later, the Ins!l!ute of 
Mechani s of the Chinese Academy of 
Science. the highest research mS!l!utlon 
in Chma. Unlike the American 
Academy, the Chinese Academy of 
Science does in-house research and 

operates liS own university and graduate 
st hool. 

Accordmg to Dr. Y. C. Fung, professor 
of app lied mechaniCS and engmeering 
sc:icnces al UCSD , hcng has ben 
instrumental in developing the science 
of mate rials subjected to very rapid 
loading - for example, what occurs 
when a meteorite h its the earth . 

' Under very rapid loading. matenals 
do not behave as they normally do," 
Fl.!I1g sa id . "For example, steel may flo\ 
li~e a fluid or rocks may become ductile. 
Understandtng thiS behavior and 
krwwi ng how to co ntrol the process has 
lI11pOrtant applications , especially for a 
COuntry with the size and population of 
China. It is easy to understand why 
cl(plos ive mechanics assumes an 
unusual importance in tht: fu ture 
development of Ch ina," he said. 

"Chma' one bi llion population is 
crowded tnto the ea tem half of the 
COUntry while the westem half. which IS 
mountainous, IS vlrtuall}, empty," Fung 
said . ''To develop the vast western half 
of the country, there Will be lot of work 
budding roads, railways. airpOrtS, 
channels, tunnels, dams and lakes; 
dearing the hills , forests and deserts; 
building the needed structures and 
developing the needed industry. To do 
thi s," he said , "the technology of using 
high explOSives is recognized as 
cOlwenient, economical and speedy. It 
sUJ:lplies a form of mobile, concentrated 

en~ rgy to be used whe re it is needed. 
But you have to unde rstand the 
mechanics in detail in order to be able 
to use this energy effiCient ly and safely," 
he said . 

According to Fung, China has 
accomplisheu a great deal in the 
development of explosive mechanics. A 
reCent US televiSion program showed 

ho~, Chinese engineers were able to 
destroy and remove a large hotel only a 
few yards from another building which 
was occupied and how they could 
100 en and remove a huge rock near a 
ralltoad track Without interruption of the 
rail traffic.

Ideological, aggressive, conservative and r.roud three to two. "It's just that so far, the political Left has been much more vocal 
than the right. " Shirck says that's 
because "UCSD is loaded with 'closet 
Republicans,'" 

UCSD's 70 College Republicans Regardless of which side has gained the most attention, the campus still seems to be plagued by a general 
political apathy that is clearly renected 
in the low voter turnout. 

By GRACE NIELSEN 
They are political ac tivists. Students 

meeting on co llege and university 
campuses across the country , organizing 
their efforts to make an impacl on our 
poli tical system and speaking out on 
co ntroversial issues such as nuclear 
freeze proposals , US intervention in 
Central America and government 
spending. Do n't stan imagining long-
haired stude nts in faded jeans and 
sandals - the new campus radicals are 
conservatives. 

They are the College Republicans. 
125,000 of the m on over 1100 campuses 
nationwide. "We're ideological , well-
trained , aggressive , conservative and 
proud of iI ," says the group's national 
chairman Jack Abramoff, a 24-year-old 
law student at Gerogetown Un iversi ty. 

The CR's newly styled activism has 
spread to San Diego too, with nedgling 
clubs to both UCSD and SDSU. There 
were no College Republican 
organizations in San Diego County until 
the UCSD CR club earned its charter 
laSt October. 

"Our organ ization has two main 
goals," said Lauri Shirck, preSident of 
UCSD's CR's. "First, to educate the 
students and professors on the 
conservative sides of the issues and 
second, to get Republicans elected to all 
levels of public office." 

Shirck, a political science major, 
worked as an intem for Congressman 
Brian Perry of Ventura who convinced 

her to sta rt a CR group at UCSD when 
she transferred. Shirck arrived at UCSD 
in September of 1983, a nd she quickly 
made comact with other Republican 
students. They got together and wrote 10 
the College Republican National 
Committee for materials to get started . 

"In November, we sel up a 
memberShip table on the campus plaza. 
We held a meeting that night and 45 
people showed up," said Shirck. Since 
then, the membership roster has grown 
to over 70. The voting membership 
includes students and employees of 
UCSD. with non-voting associa ted 
memberships for others. 

However. getting established at UCSD 
has not been easy fo r the CR's. Whi le 
they are recognized by the Associated 
Stud ent Council as a student 
organ ization, they are not eligible for AS 
fu nding (as other organizations are) 
because of their political nature. 

Instead, the group relies on 
membership dues ($4 per academic year 
fo r voting members and $10 for 
associate members), donations and 
fundraising activities such as a bake 
sales and selling "pachyd enn 
parap hernalia ." Until recently, they were 
also denied office space in the student 
center because of their partisanship. 

Shirck and other CR members see 
their problems with the AS as a result of 
a campus bias against conservatives.

paper called the California ReView are 
both d enied funding and school 
resources while liberal al temalive media 
have access to both. 
According to club members , a big pan of 

the College Republicans' appeal IS that It 
IS the only conservallve organization on 
campus and II proVides an alternative to 
campus liberalism. As an entenng 
freshman at UC D, Member hlp 
Chai rman Bruce Williams says the firsl 
thtng he noticed was "that this school is 
so liberal." 

Another member, history major Peter 
Renovitz says, "In every class I felt I was 
being spoon-fed hberalldeas." All of the 
members expressed a frustration that 
speakers, newspapers and events 
representing the political Left receive 
the most attennon and funding at 
UCSD. Renovltz beheves the CR's a e 
"helping to balance things out at UCSD." 

Until he came across the College 
Republicans , John Stalker ( the club's 
secretary) says, "I was beginning to 
wonder if I was the only conservative at 
this school." The other members echoed 
that sentiment, usually adding that they 
are relieved to have found other 
students who share the Republican 
viewpoint . 

While they may be the only 
conse rvative student group at UCSD, 
Shirck claims the registe red Republicans 
are the majority on campus 
outnumbenng the registered democrats 

"The thing that really bothers me," 
bristled Shirck, "IS that the precinct that 
encompasses UCSD has the lowest 
turnout of the county. Less than three 
percent of the registered voters voted in 
the last election." That is something the 
CR's are aimi ng to change. 

One of the group's func tions, 
according to David Wolf, CR vice 
preSident and campaign chairman , IS to 
"provide a pool of volunteers for 
registration drives and to walk 
precincts ." For every Republican I[ 
registers, the club earns one dollar from 
the sta te party's central committee. Adds 
Shirck, "When we walk preCincts and 
get voters to the polls , it's of extreme 
value to the party." 

In the upcoming presidential elec tion, 
the College Republican organization 
nationwide will be spearheadmg the 
"Youth for Reagan" campaign. "This is 
such an important year for Ronald 
Reagan and the Republican Party," said 
Shirck, "and we're going to do the most 
we can do to get Reagan and 
Republicans elected: 

If the group organizes well for the 
presidential campaign, it could 
pmentially innuence some votes in favor 
o f Republican candidates. In the 1980 
preSidential election, the Massachusetts 
College Republican Union is credited 
wi th winning that state for Reagan. They 
registered and tumed out nearly 16.000 
voters for Reagan, making him the first 
Repub lican presidential candidate since 
Eisenhower to carry Massachusetts.

Spotlight On: 
Ann Middleton 
and her interpreter Julie Randolph 

When Ann Middleton stepped off a plane in Chicago in 1981, the person who was 
supposed to meet her there walked right by her . He was looking for for someone with a 
cane or some other sign of a handicap. 

Ann 's handicap doesn't ShOWi she is completely deaf. It doesn't seem to get in her 
way muc h either. Deaf since the age of ten from spinal meningitis, Ann will graduate 
from R~velle this June with a degree in Biology and in the fa ll will begin UC Davis 
veterinary school.Through the aid of interpreters Ann has managed to make it through 
two diffic ult years at a school which loses 55% of its students, many of who m fi nd th .. 
school too difficult. 

Ann started school at Cal State Northridge, a fter graduating from Torrey Pines High 
School, where she was an ho nor student. CSU N has a stro ng program for the deaf, and 
Ann learned sign language there. Ann came back to San Diego , however, because of 
U CSD's stronger biology program, and beca use, she says, "I did n 't feel comfortable 

I-----------------i with the deaf community. I could hear for 10 years, and I can speak, so I still feel like I'm Commuter part o f the 'hearing world '."

No.1 in Student Loans 

College 
Republicans 
lOlllllllleli 111'111 l"'ge Y 

The CR's take their politics seriously, 
and the UCSD club is even planning [0 
send some members to the Democratic 
co nvention this summe r. Wolf says they 
are going "in order to understand the 
Democrats' strategy and the kinds of 
people that are going for that strategy." 

Despite their outspoken commitment 
to Republican issues and the campaigns 
of Republican candidates, Wolf and 
Shirck say they don 't necessarily back 
the party or the President completely 
every time. In fac t, Shirck says she 
disagrees with the President's policy on 
social security . Overall though, both say 
that the Republican Pany represents 
their beliefs best. 

According to Wolf. UCSD's CR club 
members "represent the range of 
political thought within the Republican 
Pany, from very conservative to mlddle-
of-the-road." 

So what motivates today's college 
student into joining a conservative, 
political youth organization? Shirck is 
quick to bring up her fears about 
national security in light of the current 
state of world affairs. '" appreciate what 
this country gives to me. I love my 
freedom and' don't want communism," 
she says emphatically. 

David Wolf says he sees it "as an 
entry into politiCS." He says he is 
considering a career in either foreign 
relations or politics. "In terms of the 
CR's and the Republican Patty," Wolf 
says, "every time I've offered my 
services, new doors have opened , but 
I'm at the stage that' don't need to set 
goals yet." Wolf is currently interning at 
the office of Assemblywoman Sunny 
Mojonnier. 

Peter Renovitz , whose conserv. tive 
interests led him to the CR's says, Â·Since 
becoming involved in CR's , the idea of a 
career in politiCS has become more 
interesting. I'd like to do that or become 

..a militaty officer. , know it's a cliche, 
but' want to do something to serve my 
country." Renovitz says he is not 
involved in Republican activities off-
campus but he would like to be. 

Another member,John Stalker, who is 
currently interning at Supervisor Pat 
Borman's office, says his original goal in 
joining the 'CR's was to meet with other 
people who had common interests 
because, "I've always been politically-
minded and interested in getting into 
politics." 

"It's imponant to Republicans to under-
stand the issues," Shirck said. "A lot 
of people are ideological Republicans, 
but how can they move other people if 
they don't understand the issues, know 
the Republican position and know how 
to defend it?" 

Â·Clearly, young people are the future 
of the patty and the pany is very 
interested in cultivating young people," 
says Wolf. Quick to dispel any thoughts 
of the CR's as a pany-controlled youth 
organization Wolf added, "T he Central 
Committee heirs us, but we're separate. 
We are here 0 our own devising." 

Not to be outdone by the Central 
Committee, the College Republican 
National Committee offers a campaign 
sc hool that teaches members campaign 
strategies, recruiting techniques, fund Â· 
raising methods and ways of dealing 

~~th the medilJ and liberal political 
groups. 

As for the rest of San Diego, Area 
Di rector Shirck is currently working on 
organizing CR clubs at Palomar and 
Grossmont colleges. "There is a strong 
conservalive o rganization at USD," says 
Shi rck, "but so far they don 't have a 
name ." 

So from the looks of things, it appears 
campus political activism is alive and 
well. But as College Republican National 
Chairman Abramoff says, "there's a 
revolution going on, all right, but it's not 
the conservatives who should be 
WOrried."

UCSD Social Column 

Semi-Nonnal Event \"'---"''':'-~-----~ 
By RONA HU 

The 1984 Semi-Formal is being billed 
as "The Gala Event of the Year." The 
Guardian, of course, has never had 
anythIng remotely resembling a socIety 
column , but I couldn't resist the 
prospect of dOIng one on something 
labeled "gala ." After extensIve and 
painstaking research (mostly conststlng 
of listening to the conversations around 
me during lecture) I am happ)' to 
announce the first, and probably last. 
UCSD social column. Here then , are 
tidbits and vital statistics on some of the 
most impreSSIve costumes planned by 
UCSD's finest: 

Carlotta Cast.anets will be wearing an 
Interpretation of the Spamsh Flamenco

32 layers of petticoats. a neckline 
plunging to her navel. and enough silk 
to cover Warren campus. IncludIng

hoops are made from the bones of fIve 
kInds of whales, all eXllnct." Rhett 
Butter, her date . Will transport her to the 
SemI-Formal on a natbed truck. 

Krisla Sleuben ha co me up With 
something original: her dress is made of 
spun glass. "I don 'l think It Will break." 
says Krista "jUSt as long as I don 't dance 
toO vIgorously." Just in case. her dllle for 
the event, Ma"well Edison , will wrap her 
in cotron and ship her LO the ballroom 
by parcel post. 

Vixen Spellbinder Will make her 
entran ce In a Frederick's of Hollywood 
special: a gown of 24 karat gold sequIns, 

purple ostrich feather shoes. and a 
noor-Iength mound of dead minks , sewn 
with their heads intact Vixen frowns on 
theam Â·s such as thigh-high slits, 
however: her will come up to her 
armpits. She also plans to wear as much 
Jewelry as is humanly possible for the 
Big Event. Why? "Well, my gown wtll be 
strapless" explains Vixen "but if I'm 
wearing enough necklaces, no one will 
notice if the gown falls ." (Smart girl , that 
Vixen.) he will be escorted by Vinnie 
trada, who wHi be attired in a Lycra 

jumpsuIt embroidered to look like a 
tuxedo. 

Bubbles La Touche will attract her 
share of glances in her semiformal attire: 
stiletto heels , garter belt and fishnet 
stockIngs. Oh , and several ya rds of 
Saran wrap. For the benefit of the 
county vice squad, she will arrive In a 
plaIn brown wrapper. "I don't see what 
they~re worried about , though : she 

claIms "It's nothing that all the guys at 
Ihis school haven't see already." She has 
nOl yet lined up an escort for the event, 
but says. 'Til be waiting by m>' favoritc 
corncr. so by eight o'c1ock I should have 
my pick of dates." 

Finally. Melvin Elvin Knerd, a Revelle 
first-year junior, is noted here nOl for 
his planned semi-fonnal garb, but for 
his unusual way of insuring a dance 
partner. He has been experimentlllg for 
the past three weeks with recombinant 
D A in the stairwell of Urey Hall , 
hoping to create the perfect woman. His 
firsl try wound up devounng several

Melvin IS still hopeful. "The last one has

for its low temperature and image of 
purity. 50 here I lay. packed in a four-
hundred-pound snow job. He claims the 
snow draws away my body heat slowly 

so I won't feel the cold. My fingers are 
beginning to doubt his theory. 

My breathing is slowing down. Like 
the times when I eat ice cream too fast, 
my throat is turning into a glacier which 
is slowly sliding deeper into my body. If 
my teeth start chanering. I'm sure ru 

Do what 
you do 
best. 

A chill is running up my spine, what 
a fool... that chill is my spine. 

How long have I got? How many 
brain cells are left? Will I know when 
it's over? Did I pay next quarter's fees 
for nothing? 

"Wake up!" 
"Ahhh!" I screamed at Ishikle . -You 

could have broken my face slapping me 
like that." I looked up to see Ishikle 
hanging down over me. "I'm alive?" 

"Sure you alive ." Ishikle said with a 
zen master's smile. - ow tell me what is 
sound of your death face cracking?" He 
roared with laughter at his combination 
of the two zen koans. the sound of one 
hand clapping and your origmal face 
before you were bom. 

Ishikle scooped me out of his ice 
bucket. I was in no mood for his humor 
or human experiments. 

Staggering to the door, I turned to 
give an artic answer to what I thought 
about his koan, when my beard hit the 
dOOljam, breaking off a frozen section . 

Watching the white hairflake's eternal 
fall, I braced myself for its impact. Like 
an exploding nova, the sta rdrops 
shattered into the dark hallway and my 
mind . 

Pointing to my former facial cover 
. melting on the ground I smiled to 

Ishikle and replied , "That."

Health and Fitness Week comes to UCSD 
By]OHN NEE 

If anythmg will be remembered of the 
70s, It will be the bIg fitnes boom that 
starred after people had gro\\TI med of 
discos , leisure SUitS and Peter Frampton. 
What has come of thIS movemcnt is big 
- bIgger than all of us. The entire 
nation IS moblhzed to become ht and 
health}' both for the old and the young. 

The fact that thIS year's ummer 
Olympics \I'm be held In thc US serves 
only to intensIfy thiS consclousne s. In 
keeping with the fervor that is rising 
with the OI}'mplC [Ides In Southern 
Cahforma, The PreSIdent's Counctl for 
Physical FItness wtll bring Health and 
Fitness Week to San DIego. Not only IS 
this event the largest pre-Ol),mplc event 
of itS kind, but it has been a decade 
smce Health and Fitness Week has 
come to Southern Cahfomia. 
Undoubtedly, the presence of the 
Ol)'mpi 5 in Los Angeles had J 
profoulld Innuence on the selection of 
San DIego as thl year's host cit)'. 

I! would be safe to venture that 111 
addition to the ObVlOUS health benefits 
Involved there are also less obVIOUS 
financIal benefits Involved In the health 
industry There IS tremendous growth 
potential in the health II1dustry - even 
for the smaller companies. AerobICS 
studiOS are springing up left and right. 
hoping to cash in excess nab for fame 
and fortune In this case . what IS good 
for American busi ness is good for 
Amenca. And everyone IS Jumping on 
the bandwagon. Most recently. Bally 
Manufacturing has Jomed the ranks of 
the healthy- minded. The most famous 
achIevement of Bally, however, was the 
Pac-Man arcade game. To put things in 
perspective, the fitness sector of Bally's 
operations has lasted seven times longer 
than the video game trend . People 
quickly grew bored with the Japanese 
game but the health and fitness craze 
will likely never pass. 

While thIS may not seem like It has a 
whole lot to do with Health and Fitness 
Week, it does. The fact that fitness 
organizanons such as Bally are posting 
profits hand over fist shows that there is 
enough mterest to warrant such an 
enterprise. However, in a nation of 200 
million people there should be much 
more concern. This is the function of 
Health and Fitness Week. 

clinic will focus on are the importance 
of parri cipation in spons and physical 
activities. stress management and 
nutrition awareness. 

During the week of May 18-24, The 
President 's Council For Physical Fitness 
will be in an Diego promot ing these 
important facets of Heal th and Fitness. 
In addition to Health and Fi tncss Week , 
there will be a two-day Celebrate Health 
Fair at the Plaza Bo nita Shopping 
Center. Parr icipating in the fa ir will be 
Southland hospi tals and physicians who 
will be giving free fi tness exams, blood-
pressure checks, foot, eye, hearing and 
dental exams. 

At UCSD, Health and Fitness Week 
will sponsor a wide vanety of events. 
Among the mo t prominent of these Will 
be the presence of representatives from 
the Los Angeles School of Gymnastics 
(lASG). The LA G has sent teams to 
major gymnastic compemions 
throughout the world . Recently, at the 
11th Annual RhythmiC Gymnastics 
Championships in Strousbourg, France , 
the lASG team had a very impressive 
performance but ult imately dId not land 
a team victory. Once agall1 , the Eastern 
Bloc showed its supremacy in an 
athletic arena. However. from this team 
two members will compete on the 1984 
US Olymp ic Team. Michelle Berube and 
Valerie l imrig both scored impressively 
in competition which led them to the 
coveted positions on the team. The Los 
Angeles School of Gymnastics RhythmiC 
Gymnasts will give an exhibition in the 
Gym Friday at 7 pm. There is no 
admission charge. 

Another high point on the program 
will be a Regional Physical Fitness 
Clinic by Dr. John Cates who is the 
chairman of this year's HFW. Accordi ng 
to Cates, the main goal of HFW is "to 
create an awareness of the importance 
of a 'healthy li festyle' and the desirability 
of 'total fitness .'" 

A few major pOintS that the week-long Hoola hoops are out but the Los Angeles School oj Gymnastics are in ... the UeSD gym Friday. 

In addition to the need to create 
awareness for health , it is fortunate that 
HFW will act as a precursor to the 
Olympics. With teams from the Eastern 
Bloc dropping from the Games, there is 
a general feeling that the OlympiCS wiU 
not be a legitimate competition. With 
the advent of HFW, perhaps there will 
be a stronger degree of support fo r the 
Olympics as well as fitness in general.

The Triton track squad finished its

several athletes seuing personal records

"It was an outstanding season for

UCSD placed fifth at Sama Bamara, 
beating Cal Tech and Biola but lOSing to 
powerhouses Azusa Pacific and Cal

season on May 5 at UC Irvine but sent

"Numerous PRs were set , the total team

to panicipate." This season is thelaSI of

Ruggers end with rough pledge 
UCSD's rugby squad concluded its 

long season on May 5 with the Alumni 
Game, enjoying a less crucial match 
than many it had panicipated in over 
the spring. 

"My goal was to improve the team 
each week, and to grasp the 
fu ndamentals of rugby," said coach Tom 
Butler, reflecting on his team's 5Â·3 
league showing, and 14-13 overall 
record. "With the players ( had . I 
accomplished what ( wanted." 

The strongest players for the Tritons 
this season were top scorers Eddie 
Mardon , Greg Baker, Steve Fentress and 
Dave Walters, whose abil ity Butler 
credited for the year's success. Their 
toughest competition came from Cal-
Berkeley, Biola and Cal Poly-San Luis

U 
Softball Playoff Information 

We are nearing UC 1)" version of 
the World erie Playoff time. I 
would ju t like to inform all of you 
potential playoff teams of the 
logi tic of playoff . 

Playoff begin Sunday, June 3 and 
run until unday.June 10. We will be 
taking the top half of each league's 
team to the playoff . Four team 
qualify from an eight team league, 
three from a ix team league. Fir t 
place team from each league will 
either receive a bye or pia a fourth 
place team from another league. You 
will be playing teams from within the 
whole division, not just your own 
league. You will obviously have to be 
flexi ble in regard to playoff time as a 

aturday league team may be playing 
a unday league team on a Tuesday. 

All divisions are s ingle elimination 
except Men " AAA and the Women" 
division. 

A new wrinkle i being added in 
our large t division, Coed A. This 
divi ion is 0 large now that it is ju t 
too big to finish in one week. We are 
going to divide thi division in half. 
We will take the Coed AA divi ion 
and call it Coed AAA. Then we are 
taking the top two fini her in each 
league of Coed A and calling it the 
Coed AA playoff . The third and 
fourth place fini her in each oed A 
I~ague will play in the Coed A 
playoffs. This hould make for orne 
very even competition. But no longer 
can we ay we have more teams in 
ju t the oed A oft ball Playoffs than 
UC Irvine has in it entire program.

We are now a little past midÂ· 
eason, so that means that it's time to 

fill you in on all the little tidbits of 
information that I've collected in my 
many excursions to the softball 
diamonds. 

It 's been an interesting eason. I 
call this " The Year of the 
Re chedu led Game." Between Easter 
weekend, Mother's Day weekend, 
Revelle river trips, Third College 
retreats, Muir College floqr trip and 
whatever Warren does with it time 
we have had eventy re cheduled 
games so far this quarter. That's one-
tenth of the games played thu far. 
The guys in the 1M office have asked 
me to plead with all of the 1M Softball 
teams to lighten up on the 
reschedules . They say they 've blown 
a fuse on their new Bud Computer 
trying to figure out when the games 
could be rescheduled. After a full 
week of frantically trying to keep 
organized, the 1M Czars go to a nice 
quiet place to recover from 
"reschedule yndrome." Rumor has 
it that Thursday night at the Rodeo i 
the place they 've chosen. Heck, those 
guys need it. Of those seventy 
rescheduled games only about 
twentyÂ· five have been made up. In a 
week or two there' . going to be a lot of 
unhappy team which didn ' t make 
the playoffs becau e they didn 't 
reschedul their game and took a loss 
again Â·t an 0Â·6 team. 

The game of the eason will take

place this Sunday at 11:00 am on 
PryatelÂ·North Field. It features 
Revelle 's favorite housekeepers, 
Swamp vs. Thraaash. Both teams 
are undefeated. Swamp is rated #1 
and Thraaa'h is rated #2. It should 
be quite a game. Look for the 
infamous Pryatel hop to decide it. 

The highe t scoring team in all 
IMs is the Women 's team OÂ·Street 
Band which has scored 102 runs in 
five games. The best defensive team 
is Men's A BOHICA, which has only 
given up 8 run in 5 games. The 
Lingusmen in Men's A are getting 
ready for their yearly playoff choke. 
The Lingusmen have 10 t only 2 
regular eason games in 5 years. 
That's probably a five year record in 
1M Softball . Only problem is that 
they have never won a playoff game. 
That is the worst five year playoff 
record. Defending Men 's AA and A 
champs Napalm Enema and Wee 

uk, respectively, have moved up 
and proven that the big, tough upper 
division aren't what they are feared 
to be. Napalm Enema moved up to 
AAA and i 2Â·1. WeeSuk moved upto 
AA and was one of the top rated AA 
team until their fir Â·t 10 s this last 
weekend . 

Look for lights on more fields and

Heck, w ,'re having trouble keeping

Bob's Book Report 
The animals are loose 
when books are cheap 

By B.B. ILOI't[ 
'lbe friends of the UCSD Ubrary sale last Friday was something to 

see. Vast lines of lean and hungry used-booksellers (D.G. Wills grew 
a beard espectally for the occasion) formed, circling outside the 
barricades, driven mad by the news that all paperbacks were a 
quarter each. SUffice It to say that the twoÂ·volume Book of Days 
that I lusted after disappeared Into an unmarked brown paper bag 
ten seconds after they let the merchant marauders, the usual 
devoted bibliophile public and a few students loose among the pulp 
pages. 

However, I did manage to get away with a volume of Byron's 
poetry, a cartoon book by Gary TTudeau, a weird tome by a man 
named Cuppy and a curious and quaint book that once formed part 
of Central's collection but had last been checked out In 1974. 

If Imitation Is the most sincere fonn of flattery, Byron flatters 
Walpole to an extraordinary degree. HIs (Byron's) dramatic poem, 
"Manfred," seems so much a recapitulation of Walpole's The castle 
of otnJnto (the first Gothic Novel) that w~en Byron diverges by 
making Manfred an adept. the experienced reader Is lost In lines 
until the last. 

Byron's states boldly that Walpole's The Mysterious Mother is 
the "last tragedy" (In other words, the last tragedy worthy of that 
name) In the fngllsh language, If you wish to read this pseudo-eplc 
of rape and incest and anti-religious mania, go ahead. There 's a 
copy In Central. 

So much for Byron, who is available in almost every library 
worthy of that name. 

for those of you who like good mysteries, the Reader's Choice 
section of Central has Perfect fnd. 'ibIs mystery, set In Hong Kong 
before and during the hurricane of the century, is a master addition 
to the Yellowthtead street series by William Marshall. for those 
who are interested In these witty, well-wrItten books (form and 
content join fairly well when Marshall writes), Perfect tnd. Thin Air, 
Skulduggery and Sci fi (the funniest of the lot, as well as the 
strangest) are now out In paperback.

'--_ UCSD Box Office & Ticketron: 452-4559 _ ........ 

By J().\N rORSBfRG 
The vision of a theater 

"committed to producing plays 
that teach as well as stir the 
heart" united UCSD drama 
professors Robyn Hunt and 
Steve Pearson and UCSD 
graduate Adrian Schriel In the 
fall of 1982, With no financial 
backers and money only from 
their own pockets, these 
Individuals were determined to 
realize their vision. 

The UCSD connection is giving 
the SDPT.a spotlight to shine 

have had to continually 
examine the question "What 
does it mean to try to survive 
doing plays that might seem to 
be Â·alternative.' 'radical,' or 
maybe 'funky' to the regular San 
Diego theater audience?" 
explains Hunt. 

In the last year and a half, 
Hunt. Pearson and Schrlel have 
been joined by four more 
theater enthusiasts. Together 
they have struggled to 
overcome the difficulties of 
finding a performIng space, 
funding productions and 
generating public interest and 
support for theIr company, the 
San Diego Public Theatre. 

Their dream of a politically 
and artistically outspoken 
theater company has become a 
reality. Today, the members of 
the San Diego Public Theatre are 
settling into their recently 
acquired home in the historic 
candy factory on Eighth Avenue 
in downtown San Diego. They 
are preparing theIr current 
production of 8ertolt 8recht's 
The caucasian Chalk Circle. 
which plays May 18 through 
June 17. 

The Caucasian Chalk Circle. 
the story . of two women 
claiming the same child, Is the 
Public Theatre's tenth 
production; however, artistic 
director Robyn Hunt explains, 
untlllast fall, the company lived 
like " tent people" with no 
permanent performing space. 
Their first production. Darto 
fo's We Won't Payl We Won't 
Payl, was performed on dark . 
nights at the Bowery Theatre In 
November of 1982. funding for 
this production came from 
contributions by the principal 
directors and loans from 
company members and friends. 
As a new company. it was not: 
eligible for government grants: 
for the first season, the 
company had to survive on box 
office receipts and small 
donations from patrons, 

where It prOduced three more 
plays: Children, Church, 
Kitchen ... : Statements /tlrer an 
Arrest Under the Immorality 
Act and Sea Harks. The Public 
Theatre concluded its first 
season In June of 1983. 

The success of its first season 
provided the company with 
sufficient funds to begin its 
search for a permanent space. 

the comer. People walked 10, 
and one person asked, 'When are 
you opening?' [thinking next 
June); and wesald. 'In twodaysl' 
And we did." 

While the renovation of the 
building continues , the 
warehouse has been trans-
formed Into a theater with a 
ftexJble. l~seat capacity that 
can accommodate proscenium, 
thrust. or arena staging, and a 
spacious lobby. 

During the summer of 1983. this 
space was found in a large 
empty warehouse downtown, 
When the Public Theatre moved 
Into the Candy factory at 311 
Eighth Avenue, it was nothing 
more than a large brick 
structu re with enormous 
potential. 

In early November, they 
began to renovate the bulldinq, 

erecting walls to divide the 
space Into a lobby, perform-
ance/audience area. and a 
backstage shop. dressing rooms 
and offices. "We opened a play 
insanely in the first week of 
December. and the theater was 
stilljust a garage," Hunt laughs. 
"Two days before we opened, 
there was rubble everywhere 
and someone painting over in 

In its year and a half of 
existence. the San Diego Public 
Theatre has already received 
international recognition. The 
company members have been 
invited by the Berl i ner 
Ensemble to perform at the 
Music and Theatrefest in 
Germany this October. 

future plans for the Theatre 
in San Diego focus on creating a 
gathering place for people to 
view plays which will stimulate ~ 
positive discussions towards 
the betterment oftoday'sworld. 
Hunt envisions "a people 
center" with art shows and a 
coffee house In the lobby, and 
dark-night concerts and 
productions by traveling 
theater troupes. Most 
importantly, she visualizes a 
theater that not only produces 
plays, but also provides a 
training ground for actors and 
seminars for individuals in the 
community who would want to 
take classes outside the formal. 
institutional atmosphere of the 
University, 

Hunt looks fOlWard to the 
time in the future when the 
company members. production 
staff and actors will be rewarded 
monetarily f<X' all the time and 
effort they devote to the 
company. for now, however. 
their love of theater and passion 
for people serve as their 
inspiration for keeping the San 
Diego Public Theatre alive. 

" We all share a sense that the 
theater is not: only 'art for art's 
sake.' While it is a way to 
express our artistic loves, 
curiosities and hungers, it is 
also the place where we can do 
some work making things [in 
our sodety) better," explains 
Hunt. "The world Is full of 
problems that need to be 
addressed, but they can be 
addressed in a hopeful. head-on 
way. rather than a depressed, 
pessimistic way. " 

â¢â¢â¢ 

After performing four plays at 
the Bowery Theatre (including 
Ifodek, Ifappy Birthday. 
freddyl and Brecht on Brecht), 
the company moved to the tiny 
4O-seat Wln~ Cafe in Golden Hill 

Devoted to produdng plays 
that contain no racial or sexual 
prEfludices and that depict 
contemporary Issues wit:\ 
realistic optimism. the San 
Diego Public Theatre company 
has difficulty in locating works 
that satisfy its high standards. 
The company members eI!Joy

Spanning the Old Globe with distinct plays 
By JAIIIrs RALPH PAPP 
Two comedies representing 

the divergent traditions of the 
European and American theater 
are running now at the Old 
Globe. Strange Snow, acted in 
the middle of the cassius Carter 
Centre Stage (with i ts vague 
impression of innovation and 
the pretension of an inverted 
" er") , combines the 20th 
century nitty with America's 
gritty, th e result being 
shouting . vi olen ce and 
copUlation, which is perhaps 1M' 
surprise. Catspiay, written by 
Istvan Orkeny and translated by 
Clara Gyorgyey, is a play In 
which the elegant tradition of 
the Austro-Hungarian empire is 
subverted , but with the 
sophistication of one of its own 
members. 

Steve Metcalfe's Strange 
Show is the sort of performance 
that makes audiences give 
standing ovations at the end, 

and not just because the Cassius 
Carter seats are less cushy than 
the Globe ones. The three 
characters are a straight-laced 
high school teacher, her brother 
and his Vietnam War buddy, who 
owns a gas station. The contrast 
of the characters is the basis for 
the humor and the drama, and 
the piece reaches effectively to 
both extremes. But then to the 
reaction between the prim sister 
and the greasy and impetuous 
mechanic, another theme is 
added, that of the brother's and 
buddy's real war experiences, 
previously untold, but still 
leaving a psychological 
influence. With this theme, one 
gets the feeling that there are 
two plays, which are not entirely 
connected. The Vie t nam 
influence flares briefly, but 
when it dies down it has not 
really thrown much light on the 
relations among the characters. 
There are other. better 

established forces at work. 
These forces the school 

teacher and mechanic, the two 
opposites that attract, try to 
reveal In characters that are a 
little too pat a little too 
unbelievable. Brian Kerwin can 
put In the unlimited energy to 
make his character work; 
Annabella Price's is sometimes 
strained. Bill Geisslinger, as the 
brother, can create a perfectly 
smooth performance for a 
smooth character. 

â¢â¢â¢ 

The sophistication of 
Catspla!ls paraphernalia is a 
reflection ofthe piece's content. 
The players and their settings 
slide in and out of the light on 
little well-oiled platforms. ,.hey 
slide in and out of the play with 
similarly well-olled speeches. 
The story is of two sisters, from 
well-heeled backgrounds before 
World War I. surviving apart 
after World War II. One lives a 

quiet life as an invalid with her 
rich son in Germany, the other a 
complicated and passionate life 
In Hungary. They correspond 
and telephone, and the second 
sister narrates and acts her 
small adventures out to the first 
one. Sada Thompson does the 
narrating and acting with that 
extra power to convince and 
interest beyond just technical 
command of a part. If she does 
not get a standing ovation, one 
must again explain it by the 
comfort of the seats. 

Uke Strange Show. it has an 
image In the background, In this 
case physically projected as a 

. . 

backdrop. It is a picture taken in 
the late afternoon or early 
morning. of the two sisters 
running In their ftrst party 
dresses, in 1918. But this 
background image Is an integral 
part of the theme; it emerges 
and reemerges In different ways 
In several contexts; It begins 
and ends the piece, while the 
present serves as the middle. 
The playwrlte does not deal with 
violent emotions, but he does 
explore ones Interconnected 
over 50 years. In spite ofthe 50-
year span, the play and the 
actors achieve a unity of all the 
disparate parts.

Keeping up 
with Modem 

â¢ â¢ 
mUSICianS 

By JOHN N[[ 
One would hardly expect that 

a group such as Modem English 
would be a product of the 
British punk movement of the 
late '70s. At the time when 
Modem English first formed, six 
years ago, there was an Intense 
move for non-musicians to 
congregate on stage and play 
thoughts and feelings and 
occasionally develop a style and 
structure of their own. 

After The Snow, Modem 
English's first American release, 
yielded the band a promising 
hit. " I Melt With You," heavy 
exposure on MTV and an 
extensive tour through North 
America during 198J. More 
recently, Modem English has 
released Ricochet Days, Its 
second project for Warner 
Records In the US and 4AD 
Records In Britain. 

As for style, Modem English 
seems to be moving Into a more 
structured and melodic vein as 
time goes on. This Is largely 
owing to producer Hugh Jones 
and his work with the band. In 
addition to producing Modem 
English. Jones has been 
involved with other mi\JOr acts 
such as Echo and the 
Bunnymen, Icicle Works and 

caruso 
by 

Klier' 

CERYECERIA MOCTE1UMIt S A. 

Rubber Rodeo. However. It was 
Jones' work with Echo and the 
Bunnymen that helped Modern 
English to decide to use him. 
Keyboardlst Stephen Walker 
elaborates, "When we were 
deciding who we wanted to 
produce Ricochet Days we had 
long lists of names and what 
they had done. and we had to 
listen to everything. It was hard. 
I really like Echo and the 
Bunnymen, and "eaven Up "ere 
In particular really brought It 
home that we wanted to use 
Hugh Jones." 

The decision to use Jones, or 

for that matter, a producer at 
ali, came when the band 
members realized that It was 
limiting for them to do their 
own production (which was the 
case with After The Snow). This 
could also be attributed to the 
fact that After The Snow was 
produced and released as an 
Import before Warner took up 
the option on the album. 

One major difficulty that the 
members of Modem English 
found producing their own work 
was that they were limited by 
their knowledge (or lack 
thereoO of studio work. Says 

THE UNCOMMON IMPORT 
DOSEQ.YIS 

Walker, " He did teach us a lot 
about song structure, verse, 
chorus, middle eight format. 
but we did try to steer away from 
that a little bit. We didn't want 
to sound too structured. The 
thing is that we were so naive 
and we werenÂ·t really used to 
working with verses and 
choruses. With the first album 
there weren Â·t really any 
problems. It'sjust that we dldnÂ·t 
achieve anything that wasn't

So everything more or less 
sounded the same live as It did 
recorded." 

WhiJc the band Ls .satblled 
with Jones' work on Ricochet 
D6IJs. according to Walker, It Is 
likely that his services wUl not 
be used on future prqec.ts. 
Walker continues, "We would 
really like to get someone like 
Peter Gabriel or Brian Eno to do 
something with us. but I don't 
know If they would be 
available." 

The most recent Modern 
English piece should be 
released soon on a 12-lnch EP 
with three other tracks. This new 
song, entitled " BreaklngAway," 
is a more upbeat dance tune 
based on the New York club 
scene which Walker describes as 
being a sort of "experiment" for 
the band. As Modern Engllsh 
feels its way through its musical 
styles, It Is Interesting to note 
the members' feelings on their 
roots as a punk band. Walker 
elaborates, " Looking back on It 
ali, it seems pretty ridiculous. 
We were all very angry and we 
thought there was a real 
revolution going on although 
there wasjust a revolution with 
the music."

One bad, 
onegood~ 
one better 

By [TItAN f[[RST 
The glorious winged-horse 

emblem ofTri-Star pictures flies 
past the screen, and you have 
been wamed. What will follow Is 
Hollywood at its most - most 
pretentious, that is . A 
picturesque, midwestern 
landscape, an endless plane of 
talL yellow grass, and a young 
boy playfully romping through 
it conjures up the most Normal 
RockweUesque of images - hot 
dogs, apple pie, baseball and 
Robert Redford. 

In a surprisingly underplayed 
and withdrawn performance 
(perhaps due to his long 
absence from the screen), 
Redford has returned to 
superstardom in the role of 
baseball great Roy Hobbs, an 
aging player who makes a late 
comeback to his lifelong 
ambition. But the possibility for 
such a glorious sendoff is 
devastated by director Bany 
Levinson's (Diner) and 
ci nematographer Caleb 
Deschanel's (Black Stallion ) 
overbearing treatment of such a 
generic story. Backlighting, 
silhouettes, thunder and 
lightning are the real stars of 
this film. 

Robert Redford makes his return to the screen In "The Natural." 

Wilford Brimley (Hotel New 
Hampshire) and Robert Duvall 
(Tender Mercies ) tum in some 

fine performances as veteran 
manager Pop Fisher and sports 
columnist Max Mercy. 

Randy Newman 's brash, 
bravado scoring only fuels the 
film 's attempts to put the 
audience into a continued state 
of orgasmic ecstasy. The 
Natural is baseball turned myth 
and Arthurlan legend. It is a 
classic tale of good and evil - a 
quest for the pennant on an epic 
scale. But the film's endless 
" suspense" and shifts to slow 
motion before Redford 's 
inevitable homeruns are only 
insulting. 

â¢ â¢ â¢ 

The Bounty, a third film 
version of this classic sea tale, 
lends some additional insight 
into the nature of Fletcher 
Christian's (Mel Gibson) mutiny 
of Captain William Bligh 's 
(Anthony Hopkins) Bounty. An 
outstanding performance by 
Hopkins leaves us with much 
more empathy for the usually 
ruthless Bligh, and some light Is 
shed on the likely unstable 
condition of an inexperienced 
Fletcher Christian. 

But it is all too easy to 
understand why a crew of

mostly teens would be lured to 
revolt by the temptation of 
dozens ot jiggling Tahitian 
breasts - which Is exactly what 
this film resorts to. After all, 
what credence has duty when 
one is so tar from clvlllzation 
and so near to a veritable 
paradise , sexual and /or 
otherwise? 

As in The Natural, 
cinematography is the reigning 
force behind The Bounty. One is 
constantly assaulted with 
beautifully photographed, lush 
tropical scenery. Indeed it is 
beautiful. Yawn. 

â¢ â¢ â¢ 

A French ski resort, a couple 
ot best buddies and a gorgeous 
blonde temptress - welcome 
to Bertrand 8l1er's charming 
comedy, My Best friend's Girl. 
Isabelle Huppert's sumptuous 

performance as Vlvlanne, a 
drifter who carries all she owns 
In her car, Is the centerpiece ot 
this love triangle. Pascal 
(Thleny Lhermltte) and Micky 
(Coluche) are the Inseparable 
best buddies whose friendship Is 
rumed by the Intrusion of this 
female into their Intimate cabin 
surroundings. 

This is not a great movie, nor 
does It try to be. And here is its 
strength. Intense and 
overbearing emotional confl icts 
are avoided, as are detours Into 
the realm of French cocksman-
ship, or profound judgments 
about relationships and 
territoriality. Ultimately, none 
of these characters is either 
chaste or evil; all are vulnerable. 

This is a simple story of 
friendship among three people. 
8l1er has created a modestly 
humorous flIm. 

"1'1)' Best f'rIend's Girl" features veteran .cb'ess INbeIIe Huppert.

An interdisdpIinary synthesis of the prindples underlying the 
process by which the universe evolved. The course will range from 
consideration of subatomic particles to galactic clusters and from 
the "Big Bang" to the development of life and human civilization, 
including prospects for the future . Emphasis will be placed on how 
the revolutionary transformations that science is undergoing 
provide a new framework for centuries-old epistomological and 
philosophical debates.
