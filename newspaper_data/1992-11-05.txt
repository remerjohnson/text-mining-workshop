Clillton Must Follow DIrough on 
Campaign Promises of Chalge 

Bill Clinton \ substantial victory over George Bu~h e~tabli, hed a 
clear mandate - the American people want change. An y proof of this 

~tatemen t can be found in the renewed interest voters showed in the 
campaign thi, year. Voter tul110Ul on Tuesday wa, the highe't it had 
b.!en in year,. 

Clearly. the voter" were interc,ted in this electi n. and clearly they 
wantcd chan!!c. For the lir"t time ,in c Franklin R -.evelt wa~ 

pre~ident. Sa~ Diegocounty voted Democratic. tates that were long-
time ,tronghold, of the Republican Party opted for Bill Clinton. 
During I~lton '" acceptance \peech. the crowd at Golden Hall in 
downtown an Diego erupted every time he mentioned the word 
chang. 

Btll Clinton's agenda has been-.et for him. ow. it\ hi s respon\i-
hlllty to carry out this change in a way that will bene lit all American~ . 
The .,Iuggish economy. clearly the biggest c n em of many vote~. 

mu~t be revivcd and revived quickly. Racial strife , the AID crisis and 
health care are issues that need to be addreS\ed immediately. Clint n 
called for unity in the campaign. and now that he h,L, won, he mu,t 
promote a renewed spiri t of unity am ng the American pe pIe. 

Bill linton promi~ed to do all of th is on the campaign trail. ome 
inauguration day. it will be time to deliver. He and AI G re ran an 
cnergetic ampaign. TIley were able to overcome man challenge~ 
and ha7ard" on thl: road to the White House. w. it i, impcrJtive for 
thcm to appr ach their 3dmini,tration in the same way. linton and 
G re need to adopt a "take no pri\one~" attitude. fo llowing through 
on promise, of change within their fir~t 100 days of of lice. 

TI,i\ call for change and a tion must nOl be confu,ed with a 
mandate forthe traditional Democratic platfonll ofta>. and spend big 
govemment. ll, i, i\ clearly not the case. a~ proven by the large 
percelllage of the popular vote that independent candidate Ross Perot 
received. The voter~ rightl saw Clinton as the be~t po\\lble agent of 
chan!:!c. and for that rea\on. he wa.., elected. 

/( ~tKI) be a tcmptation for linton to take it eas • in the next fc" 
month\ to reward him\c1f f r a hard-fought and wcll·run campaign. 
But the problems facing the country arc too great to put a,ide until 
inauguration day. It \ time for Clinton to get to work nowon delivering 
those promi-.es of change.

SATIRE: After meeting up with 
Elvis the Lobster and Jimmy 
Hoffa the Shade, we come face 
to face with Zorgon himself, 
and the results aren't pretty 
By Sam Halpern 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

My get·together with Elvis and Jimmy be· 
came the high point of my week. I bought Elvi~ 
five new T-,hirts bearing the "I Survived the 
Point Loma Sewer Break" logo and fi ve ot her.. 
wit h a variety of messages, most of them ob· 
M:ene in the California Surfer tradition. 

Getting the shirts made with all the holes 
needed for his legs and head wasn' t easy. I 
explained to the tailor that they were a humor-
ous gi fl for a friend . We both had a big laugh 
when he ~aid, "Your buddy\ built like a 
goddamned lobster." 

Keeping Jimmy happy me:lI1t a 20-pound 
lurkey. Instead of cooking it . I pumped it full of 
alcohol at the lab. The guys kept promising me 
that I'd get to meet Zorgon. but noth ing hap· 
pened until one night Elvis ;lIld Jimmy didn't 
show. I had walked at leas[ two miles from the 
pier ~lI1d was very disappointed. 

As I staned back. a [all , thin man began 
following me. ba.seball cap pulled down over 
his face. He was gaining pretty rast. In the 
moonligh[ his clothes looked floppy, maybe 
ragged. I started away from the waler's edge 
towards the street.nnd he quickly cut me off. He 
got abou t six feel rrom me and look off the cap. 

His head was flat on top with an extremely 
wide rorehead. lid·less and cou ntersunk eye~ 
and a button-like no~e. His fnce sloped like a 
wedge to his chin . Right inthe middleofhis face 
was a tiny mOlllh and at the ~ides of his head the 
biggest ears I h~tve ever seen. A third ann 
protruded directly out of his m id-chest. Even in 
the pale light. I cou ld tell he was greerL It could 
on ly be Zorgon. Elvis was right; he was bener 
looking than Mick Jagger. 

"Gonna rock ... rock ... rock tonight. .. say 
hey man." came from behind me, and I tumed

behind him rose the great dorsal fin. then the 
gaping. serrated mouth of Jimmy. scooped up

Ihe sand. 

"Funny:' said Elvis. "You could have busted 
one of my legs. man. Hey Sam. meet Zorgon ... 
Zorgon. this is our buddy." 

I put down the turkey and reached for the 
hand on hi s chest arm. Zorgon jumped back. 
"What are you doing ... what are you doing?" he 
screamed in a Hindi accent. 

"No. Sam. 1111./ Nor TI/(/t "andf" yelled Elvis. 
"You mean ... ;" I asked. 
"Yeah. man." 
"A .. . thousand pardons. Zorgon." I stam-

mered. "No offense!" 
"What kind of person does suchathing when 

he l11eet~ another person in public?" Zorgon 
asked. 

"Hones[ to Pete. I didn 't know," I said. "1 
never met a Zelschmitt:m before." 

"And if you don't learn your manners, you 
never will again: ' he said. 

"How come you speak with an Indian ac-
centT I asked Zorgon. 

"India was where I crash-landed. I lived 
there for 60 years before coming here." 

"How did you survive, not knowing the 
language, customs or anyt hing?" 

"I round work as a guru." 
"But. didn' t people think you were ... differ-

"Among the gurus. no one seemed to notice.

Throughout this campaign ,eil on. Ihe 
Democrats. the media and the Perm camp 
have all ridiculed the president for publi Iy 
claiming that he would do "whatever it takes"

Fir..t is the Gulf War and Sadd~lm Hussein. 
Pundils point wilh near glee to the fact that 
Hussein will probably remain in power long 
after Bu h is gone. Democrats who opposed 
the war are now trying to have il both ways by 
faulting Bush forlelting Hu~:.ein'tay in power 
and for"betraying"lhe Kurds3nd Ihesouthem 
Shiites. 

What the DeI110CrJb forget i, Ihat the Gulf 
War was a multi-nalion collaborJti on involv.

and any attempt to destabi lize Hussein would

CANCELLING ROTC IGNORES STUDENT NEEDS 
Editor: 

In "ROTC ProgrJm Cancelled, Policy Vio· 
lations Cited"~ (Oct. 15). a leiter frolll Peter 
Irons was quoted which urged Ihe Committee 
for Education Policy (CEP) to rev iew the 
relationship with UCS D due to a "lack of 
connection wi th UCS D's academic mission 
and discrimination "'l.sed 011 sexual oriel1la-
t ion ." On June 12. 1992. [he committee levied 
its dec is ion described in the anicle. Thejudge-
ment of the CEP was based upon fallacy 
entrenched in lack or concem for the needs or 
the sludent population. 

[n reality. the cross·town agreement be-
twccn UCSD and usn that had allowed mid-
shipmen from UCSD to enroll in the NROTC 
program was terminated as of May 29. 1992. 
The reasons were purely economic: UCSD 
was more than willing to accept the $60.000 
plus a year for the last ten years in scholarship 
money. but unwilling to offer any physical 
supponfonhe program which USDand SDSU 
have generously provided. 

Regarding the alleged reason for the "dis-
missal" of ROTC from campus. the universi ty 
is opposed to the military policy on homo· 
sexuality. The CEP should realize the univer-
s ity does not make military policy and neither 
does ROTC. The policy on homosexuality is 
that of the President of the United States via the 
Secretary of Defense. 

Dr. Douglas Smith. [he past chaimlan of 
the CEP. stated that the committee has been 
--his[orically opposed to the ROTC program." 
The relationship bel ween the universi ty and 
the military transcends a cross-town ROTC 
agreement with SDSU and USD: Ihe Depan-
ment of the Navy is a major contributor to 
re earch at UCSD. According to the Office of 
Naval Research at Scripps In,litution Of

Students Flood PoDs in Record Nmnbers 
ELEC1ION '92: 72.5% of the 2,559 
voters registered on campus turn out 
By Karen Cheni 
Associate News Editor 

Campus voter turnout hit atl all-time high Tuesday. ;l~ 
elet.1ion clay brought an end to over a year of campaigning . 

According to the San Diego County RegistrnrofVo/i!r.'. 
1.856 of the 2559 votersregiSiered on campus actually vOled 
for a record 72.5 percent. 

Lee Juliano. an election official at the Muir Apartment 
Lounge. commented on the vOler tumout at tllat precinct. 

"Our first voter came in :II 7 a.m .. and we had a solid 
turnout from 8 a.m. on ... it was a steady ~am all clay." she 
said. 

At I p.m .. they broke the record for voter turnout :II 
approximately 400 studenLs ... It passed the primaries." Jul i:tno 
\aid. "We had to go get extrJ baliOlS twice." 

According to Doug Hartmann. the outreach media coor-
dinaror for the Clinton-Gore camp:tign. the re:lson for a high 
student voter tumout was part of a growing discontent among 
votel'S aged 18-2-t. 

"lit was] p;1It of the mllional trend and a demand for 
change." Hamnann said. 

UCSD Political Science Professor J1hur Lupia agreed 
that students and the country in geneml were increasingly 
involved in thi~ year·selection. "'fhepresidential debates had 
hi!!her l'Jtin!!s than the ba.~ba" pl"yoff~ ... IBut) it's hard to 

pi~point n. ~gle reason ... 1 wou Idn't walllto predict any son 
of trend I for future elections)." 

UCSDCollege Republicans ChairGary Geilercited voter 
mlstr.ttion as one of the main re..'\.o;ort, for the high vOler 
turnouL 

"Perot had a 101 to do with il...lhel really made people 
Ihink about the issues .... [and) " lot more wOlllCn were 
voting:' he said. 

Clinton won a 1and.,lide vic!Of)' anlongs[udents at UCSD. 
according to figures supplied by the County Registmr which 
,howed Bush wilh 19.1 percent. Clinton at (H.O percent and 
Perot with l·tS percent. Other c:tndidlles received less than 
I percent of the total VOle. 

--It's:t very libeml campll'; - administrators and stUdellL~ 
alike:' Geiler said in response to the Clinton Victory.

beer. wine and 'pirits are good for 
you. I could quote statist ic~ on lon-

wine. but you' ve already had enough 
stats shoved up your 3!>S by the do-
gooders (Spectacle. Sept. 28), Do you 
realize that lIIore fhall half of those 
admitted for Slab wounds in an Or-
ange County tr:lUma center had IIOT 
been drin~ing'! And given that you 
were goi ng to be stabbed. wouldn't 
you prefer to be drunk at the time? 
Oklly. I'm being facetious. but no 
moreoff-the-mark than the ant i· booze 
fundamental ism which pervades "po-
litically correct" ,ociety in the USA. 

A philo~ophy. by the way. which 
even undennine~ the so-called Ameri-
can ideal of "freedom." A few weeks 
Jgo. a kr..lln iancelebration wa.~ held 
in Balboa Park. Singing. dancing and 
vodka - well. only two out of three. 
,Ince the law prohibited the tradi -
1I0nallubrication. 

And I. ;1\ an up-.tanding Britbh

If someone hit you overthe head with

and then to cause an accident. People 
can and do use can;, knives and guns 
to kill and maim wi thout the aid of 
alcohol. so I suggest that pressure 
groups go home or find another scape-

1he Student Regent 
Needs Your Input 
Editor: 

For as long 3., I have been a MU -
dent. one of the comlJlOn complaints 
r ve heard is that the regents are not 
acce,~ible . Students do not believe 
the board under~ta nd:, theirconcern~. 
I have attempted to addre:., that i~sue . 
I have initiated call1pu, forums on 
each of the UC campu~e~ for the 

~pecific purpose of providing ave· 
hicle forstudent/Regent communic;l-
tion. On Friday. Oct. 23. I held an 
open forum on campu~. The purpo~e 
of this forum was to allow ~tudents 10 
directly question their represelll~tive 
on the Board of Regent~. to find out 
where I stand on the i~" ues. and to 
ex pres, whatever concern~ ~tudents 
had. Five people ~howed up. 

For me to represent students. I 
need students to take an active role in 
rJising issues and lobbying for them. 

To every student reading this let· 
ter. I warn JOu that the university is 
faci ng the fargest budget crisis in its 

hi~tory. As students: we are directly 
nffected by thi s problem. PrOlestalone 
is not enough. Please get involved. 
Write your local assemblyperson and 
senator. Write to the governor. Work 
wi th the UC Students' Associ;nion 
and your campus government. Work 
wi th me. If you are angry - channel 
that anger into action. If you want a 
voice on the board - you have one. 
My home number is (5 10) -175-0977. 

I know how busy you are. B uti a.~k 
every one of you to do what you can 
to not only voice your anger, but to 

work towards a so lut ion. For me to 
have any effect on the Board. I need 
your help. Please get involved.

progr:lm. UCSD studenh may. with 
the penni,~ion of their college. enroll

for SDSU and USD to have on fi le 
wi th us in order to tr;ln~fer ~cholar· 
~hi p monies to UCSD for ~tude nts 
pursuing a future military career. 
SDSUand USD canceled this agree· 
ment at the end of this year because a 
klrge majority of the government 
scholar~hip funds aV;lilable to stu-
dents pursuing military careers was 
being diverted to UCSD ,tudents in· 
stead of 10 SDSU and US D students. 

The award of academic credit you

It is the award of transfer credit for 
military science courses taken else·

Where 20 Is 
Almost Ancient 

I :un getting old~ Thk. realization 
ha., been growing on me ever since I 
>1:11100 coaching football at Lt Jolla 
Country Day School. I am an:c sisr.ul( 
CO:lCh for the ~ighth-~'J'ade nag 
footlxlllte:lm. and it h:t\ been quite an 
experience. 

It all st;uted out innoc;,'cntly enough 
about five weeks ago. The practice 
!>Chedule was simple: every we.:kd:IY 
from I :30-::!: 15. with a couple of 
game:- each week. That was before I 
actually went to a prJ tice 

llle really scary p:ut i~ that I wa., 
in eighth grade only seven year.. ago 
myself. If ::!O-ye:tr.;-old is old. then 
what are fifth·year senior.;? C;L..e in 
point: yesrerday we were having a 
discll~sion before pmctice about the 
motorcyc Ie I was riding. An assi.5tant 
coach with the seventh grade team. 
who is an ancient ::!4. said he used to 
ride an A TV when he wa.~ in eighth 
grade. One of the players was 
dumbstruck. "You had ATV's when 
you were a kid'!" he ga.~ped. eyes wide 
in di,belief. Well. yeah. but they were 
steam powered. 

But enoogh of thi, self-pity. I want 
to talk to yoo about this team. that for 
the Ia. ... few weeks ha.~ robbed me of 
any sense of authority I once had. 

1llere was no way I wa.~ a.~ 
completely out of control in eighth 
gr.KIe a.~ these kid, are. 0 way. I 

re~pectOO my elder." w:t, nice and 
quiet ;1I1d neVt:r told my coache:. thJt I 
would "kick YOllr a,-,s!" which I've 
been hearing a lot lately. Atlt:a.~tl 
don't think I did. 

B;t.;ic;llIy. my job boil~ down to 
watching the team run plays and then 
making :-ome helpful M,gge~tion~ 
which the inten<k.'d subject.; wiUnot 
pay any attention to at all b::rore 
nrnning off 10 re"ume some important 
activit), like dog·piling OIl each other.

remaining wt: are a more-th~l n­
n:~pectable 7-::!·1, but to tell you the 
tnH h I cou ldn 't tell YOlilhe score of 
:my but the I;L~t two. 

A funny thing happen, when 
you're walking the ~idelines. Even 
with the relatively minor role that I 
play. I b..'Come totally absorbed in the 
game. It \ not at all like watching:1 
game in the sl:U1(b. Coaching fOOllxlll 
requil1!S a meticulous attentiOll to 
demil so that mvialthings.like the 
score or whal quarter it is or who the 
opponent i ~. juS( seem to slip out of 
your mind. You become.so absoIbed 
in watching. in this ca~. all 16 players 
on the fJeld and then trying to predict 
what the adler eight are going to do. SO 
that you can tell your eight what to do. 
that you find yourself not so much 
watching the game as think ing about 
it.

Law.! Kranz had astellarnight, drill · 
ing 20 kill. and confounding the 
CoYOle·sdefense. Elizabeth Banez was 
second for the Tritons with 12 kills. 

The home crowd rallied behind the 
Tritons the entire night as they came OUI 
in game one looking intense and confi· 
dem. 

Game one was neck·and·neck umil 
UCSD gained momentum through the 
blocking teamwork of Kristi A~keland 
alldJulie H,uvey. who broughtthellCore 
to 10-10 and the excited crowd to lheir 
feet . 

UCSD nevcr looked back afterth,ll, 
and went on to easi ly win the game.

play by CSUSB kepl lhe mornenlllln in 
the Tliton~' favor until they gOl only 
their ~ond ~ido!-<)ut of the match. 

11le tide began to tum in the Coy· 
otes' favor, :l~ they responded to the 
Triton~ with eightunan.wcn.'d points of 
their own. 

UCSD Head Coach Doug (},tnnevik 
called a timeout. The Triton~ have been 
plagued this ~eason with the inabili ty to 

put games away in which they had 
estabIil.hod a lead. Dannevik. knowing 
his team needs confideoce going into 
this month', regionals, wa.'IIl·t aboullo 
let that happen this lime. 

He mUSI have iru,pired the team. 
beca~ the Tritons loughened up. got 
the side-out, a.ld pUI the game away. 

Game three. like game one, was 
tight throughout. The Tritons' bright 
.pots Can1e in crucial side~ts to keep 
them in the thick of things. 

The Harvey/A keland blocking 
machine kepi the Tritons from I ing 
interu.ity, but at 8-5, UCSD leading, 
Dannevik made what he I:ller called "a 
dumb mi~ake." 

Dannevik. wanting 10 give the lleC-
ond string playing time. ,ub:.tituted OUI 
all but one of his ~:u1ers. l11e T ritans 
began to stagnate, CSUSB took advan· 
(;Ige of the opponunity, a.ld tied the 
;,core at 8-8. 

At 8-10. Dannevik called a till1eOUt

to the CoyOle., however, who held the 
Tritons at eight poin! and went on to

ourgame, ~lhat they will have to worry 
about us." 

Considering the team \ ix ganle 
unbeaten , treak going into the 
poslseason, very linle needs to be 
changed. Jodie Robenson, one of only 
three senioo on the team, fee ls the teanl 
is peak iog :II the right moment. ·'We' re 
coming together when il really counts. 
Right now we've £01 everybody fo-
cused on soccer," Robertson said. 

With such a young team, keeping 
focused is crucial for UCSD's .uccess. 
TheTritons'senioo,DuI k,Robertson 
and Joanne daLUz. the only remaining 
members of 1989'~ national champion-

fresh01en pumped up. "Weju.<,t have to

Perhaps McManus' biggest worry 
is keeping the team cool undo!r fire. "I

coach s..1id. "NOI doing anything tupid.

Kelly Kr.lmer said. 'Thi is it. we know

Dan McOo",ell/Guard,/lfl 
Carin Pugh tries to outNn two defenders earlier this year, Pugh led the Tritons with nine goals, 

A fmid to upsel lhe te.1m' s momen·

Courtney Pine's

10 HOlll(,. unsucce.~s­
fully tries to combine 
the sounds of Jamaica 
with the jazz sounds 
thar grew out of the 
American bayous and 
52nd Street. 

While the slick 
production of this 
recording does 
belong to the school 
of new thought in 
international jazz. the 
rhythm and bass 
lines stem purely 
from that island 
forever dreamed of 
in . moke-Iaden on-
campus apartments. 
For this reason the 
album does not seem 
to hold together 
creatively.111e 

cour1eSty 

Canl.mpor. y mytMl by Cowiney PIne 

fusion does nol work. 
It is apparent that Pine is a 

proficient musician. He plays 
numerous instruments, from 
sopranino saxophone to drums to 
keyboards. Yet because of a vel)' 
shiny production and all the 
effects he employs. his chops are 
too slippel)' and glossy to get a 
grip on. 

E1(emplified on the song '" 
Don ' t Care:' one can almost 
hear some imaginal)' lyrics 
being mimicked by Pine's sax 
melody miller than.J!eing 
expanded upon anCl'tmnsfonned 
into a more instrun\ental 
languuge. It just becomes a 
muzak vers ion of a Stevie 
Wonder-type of happy song. 

There are some vel)' short 

interludes throughout the album in 
which one can detect the true sty le 
of Courtney Pine. or at least tile 
flavor he should be producing. Yet 
as a whole. C l os('I' III H OIII(, seeks 
to fuse two types of music that do 
not work well together: the reggae 
makes the jazz simple. and the jazz 
makes the reggae silly. 

Allhough Pine's music is not 
the tapioca perfom-.ed by other 
contempo jazz musicians (Kenny 
G immediately comes to mind). it 
lacks the edge needed to keep any 
type of jazz music: from sounding 
lik.: grocel)' store mu. ic. Hope-
fully. next time Courtney Pine wi ll 
tl)' not to traipse around on 
Jamaican beats. 10 the ultimale 
benefit of his music.

ContInued from H1 
case in this production. It i~ clear 
when the audience laughs louder 
at a grape being tossed in tile air 
and caught in someone', mouth 
than at the text that !>omething is 
nOlright. 

Layered on like u veneer to 
Ihi~ witty comedy i~ the ~moke of 
the L.A. riots. Wufting onto the 
stage in act two, televi,ion 
screens light up at various 
locations around the ~t to remind 
us what i happening uway from 
the e~tate of our rich friends and 
their cateren;. While Shakespeare 
makes a habit of tying up his 
comedie~ with multiple wedding, 
and jubilant dancing. McAnuff 

take~ pleasure in untying theM! 
tidy knots with the epbooe~ from 
the outside world. But the tableau 
of a television broadca~ting L.A. 
riot footage makes lillie ~n~ and 
M:em~ overly obtru~ive. 

It is impo~!>ible to deny the 
pamllels between the period 
during which Shakespeare wrote 
thi, play and the modem period.

Ihat in the original productions of 
Shake~peare'~ plays, the actors 
always wore modem dress, even 
in the hi~tories . o. maybe all thi~

MOYI[ R[YIEW 
Frozen Assets: Producer and co-writer speaks out about spenn banks and romance 
By Meliss. Jacobs 
Guardian Reporter 

Take a litera ry agent tUl1led 
scriptwriter and producer. two 
famous t elevi~ion . tan;. add a 
small burg in Oregon and dasl, :n 
a sperm bank ilnd you might come 
up \ ith quite a sticky mess . Ask 
Don Klein and he might say that 
he came up with a (pro)creative 
combi nation for his new fi lm. 
Fm:l'lI Ass(!{s. 

" I wanted to write a romantic 
comedy that would make people 
laugh in their pants. that could 
have a bit of the ou trageous. as 
well as a lot of heart." explained 
Klein . producer/co-writer of the 
new comedy during a recent 
phone interview. 

Klein said that this movie 
"recalls the romantic conflict of 
WlIl'n Harry Met Sally, combined 
with the sexy wamlth of Prl'uy 
IV (llllon. " 

Corbin Bemsen plays corpo-
rate yuppie Zach Shepard who is 
sent by hi s superiors to run a bank 
in a small Oregon town. Hb 
excitement is soon dampened 
when he discovers that thi s 
"bank." which is supposed to be 
the ladder upon which he will eurn 
a promotion in the company. is 
not a financial institution but 
rather a spenn bank. 

Contlict arises when Bernsen 
meets his match. Shelly Long. an 
efficient and idealistic: biologist 
who is the director of the ~penn 
bank. Dedicated to helping create 
babie~ for childless couples and 
unconcerned with profit-making. 
she i~ totally opposed to Bernsen's 
plan to rum the non-profit bank 
into a high-tech. money-making 
machine by sponsoring a virility 
contest for the townsmen. for 
which the men have to go without 
smoking. drinking or ex. Many 
confrontations arise. with the 
spice of a brewing love interest in 
the background - one of those 
love/hate type of relationships-
to give way to a light-hearted. 
entenaining story. 

The idea for the film began 10 
years ago. when Klein. a literary 
agent in Los Angeles, approached 

Tom KaJ10zian (one of the writers 
he represen ts) and asked him to 
help write a ~cript revolving 
around the contempomry b~ue of 
Spel1l1 bank~. 

"It 's a newswonhy subjcct that 
hasn ' t yet been fully tapped. 
Spellll banl..s ,ort of repre~ent sex 
of the '90s:' explained Klein. He 
wanted to bring thi~ topic out into 
the open in a forum that would 
allow viewen; to laugh and be 
comforlable. yet unden;tand and 
appreciate the imponance and 
serious nature of the i~sue. 

A significant factor in the 
making of this movie i~ Ihat it \\las 
financed "independently" through 

" . .. she is totally 
oppo ed to 
Bern en's plan to 
tum the non-profit 
bank into a high-
tech money-making 
machine by sponsor-
ing a virility contest 
for the townsmen .. , " 

Klein' ~ effons. instead of by large 
corporations like Univen;al 
Studios. With monies Klein had 
made through real estate invest-
ments. his literary agent career 
and the financial support of some 
private investon;. Klein was able 
to produce a large-~cale. full -
length feature film for approxi-
mately $5 million. as oppo~ed to 
the usual mnge of $25 million or 
more for most feature films. 

"You can't afford to waste 
anything when you're indepen-
dent:' emphasized Klein. This is 
not a project that mo~t individuals 
would take on. both from a 
financial ,tandpoi nt and becau,e 
of the time and efforl involved. 
' 'I'm a ri~k:' said Klein. " I wanted 
to do something that would leave 
a mark."

und rewriting of the script. the 
crew began production on the film 
a little over a year ago. The 
realistic nalure of the subject 
helped Klein and company to 
attract Long. who plays a char.tc-
ter somewhat comparJble in style 
and personality 10 her chameter 
Diane on the televbion sho\ 
"Cheers." 

The camamderie that devel -
oped between Long and Bel1l~n 
while working on "Hello Ag;lin" 
helped influence Bernsen to take 
his role. 

Larry Miller and Dody 
Goodman also star in thi s film . 
Considering the film', relatively 
small budget and Ihe fact that 
Klein was new to thi, industry. he 
considered it a great honor to 
work with ~uch well-known 
actors and uctre"es. 

Before doing the movie. Klein 
said. he wasn'l aware of the 
widespread u~e of ~peml banl...,. 
"SO many people have ,hared 
storie:. about 'banks' with me. I'm 
amazed at how common it b.

Unes Ballet: Choreographer King expresses intimacy 
By Amy Sweeney 
Guardian Reporter 

Intemillionally renowned 
choreographer Alonzo King will 
bring his creative modem ballet to 
UCSO's Mandevi lle Auditorium 
Friday al 8 p.m. 

teristic is King's personalized 
dance language. According to 
King. "When you are with 
someone you love. you communi-
cate in a way that you don' t wi th 
other people ... you become more 
intimate and personal." 

with a tour of seveml of the 
University of Cnlifomia cam-
puses. 

For more information about the 
Lines ballet perfonnanee. call 
534-4090. 

The' I O-year-old Lines 
Contempor.uy Ballet wi ll be 
performing three wo",s which 
King. during a recent phone 
interview. said involve "struggle. 
joy. beauty. pain and curiosi ty." 
As the founder and choreogra-
pher. King has combined a 
c1a~sical ballet base with his own 
personal dance 1,IOguage to 
produce a truly original combina-
tion of movement and intimacy. 

King began his career ill a 
young age a. a dancer. choreo-
graphing his first wo", at 17. He 
has worked with ballet companies 
all over the world. including the 
Hong Kong Ballet. the Frankfurt 
Ballet and the New YOIX Joffrey 
Ballet. He now creates and stages 
works for Lines. 

He aid hi relationship 
with bal let is one in which "the 
public sees and is exposed to 
the int imacy wi th that 
relationship." This "inti-
macy" wi th dance cremes an 
arti tic tlhnosphere that ~ts 
Lines apart from other 
companies. 

The dancers 
themselves add to 
Ihi relationship. 
According to King. 
the style of the 
bal let "comes from 
the art ists themselves." He want 
his dancers' interpretations to be 
as close to "their original voice-
as possible. The re~uh is a 
performtlnce that shows the souls 
of the dancers and the choreogm-
pher. King said the dancers are 
generous. "they give 100 percent 
in tenns of body mind and spirit." 
The artists and creator work 
together to creale a strong 
cohesion that makes Lincs ~ t and 
out. 

" ! 

King said he named the 
company Lines because Ihere is 
"nowhere where there is not line: 
in nature. our bodies. the whole 
world is non-stop line." King 
created the San Francisco-based 
company on Ihis premise in 1982. 
The performances feature a wide 
range of relaxed but controlled 
movement. elegant lines and a 
creative technique. 

Lines' distinguishing charac-

In addition to its San Fmncisco 
performances. the award-winning 
company also tours the United 
SlateS tlnd Europe. Lines i
