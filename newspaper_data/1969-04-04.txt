McGillInauguration 
Acting-Chancellor W1lliam J. 

McGill w1ll be inaugurated as 
Chance llor of the University of 
California at San Diego in a 
ceremony to begin at 11 :00 a.m. 
on Friday, April 11, 1969 in the 
UCSD gymnasium. 

McG1ll has acted as chancellor 
of the San Diego campus for the 
past eight months , and the cere-
mony is viewed largely as a 
formality, according to the Pub-
lic Affairs office. The comment 
was made in answer to inquiries 
about rumored intentions bycer-
tain groups to block McGill's 
inauguration. According to Pub-
lic Affairs, the California Re-

pubucan Assembly passed a re-
solution asking the Regents to 
block the inauguration. 

"He has been Chancellor for 
the past eight months," said a 
spokesman for the P.A. office, 
"and the ceremony is only an 
opportunity to invite the public .•. 
it's largely a formality. But I 
haven't been informed of any in-
tentions to actually disrupt the 
ceremony." 

The inauguration is open to 
members of the academic com-
rrrunity and invited guests. An 
open house period for the mem-
bers of the civic community will 

, follow from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m.

AcadeDlic and A .S. Sena t es 
Study RecruitDlent Policies 

, The AS Senate last night de-
bated its proper response to Lh .. 
confrontation with the Marines 
here last quarter. Although the 
debate was ultimately tabled un· 
til the meeting after next, se-
veral proposals were discussed. 

The discussion had been promp-
ted by a resolution Tom Baer 
made in' reaction to a suggestior 
at the Academic Senate meeting 
by Chancellor McGill. McGill ' 
suggested that the AS hold a 
referendum asking the students 
if they supported the continued 
use of their funds fo run the 
Placement Center, and if mili-
tary recruiting or any recruit-
ing should be allowed on campus. 
He would consider the vote on 
the use of student fees as bind-
ing upon him, and the vote of 

the students of their feelings 
as an important factor ( along 
with the feelings of administra-
tion and faculty) in the final de-
cision he will make regarding re-
cruitment. 

Baer' s motion rejected these 
suggestions. It dismissed the 
vote on the use of student fees 
as irrelevant to the real issue. 
It arged against a referndum on 
student opinion because: (1) The 
issue of genocide cannot be sepa-
rated from that of military re-
cruitment, and genocide is a mo-
ral issue not subject to vote, 
and (2) the vote's sole purpose 
would be to advise Chancellor 
McG1ll and if McGill wants ad-
vice he can get it by holding 
the referendum himself. 

Regents To Investigate 
UC Campus Papers 

LOS ANGELES (CPS}-The Re-
gents of the University of Cali-
fornia have ordered an investiga-
tion of campus newspapers and 
the use of student government 
money for bail funds. 

The investigation of the cam-
pus papers came at the urging 
of one regent, John Canaday, 
who said he had been readingtbe 
nine campus papers "with a 
fair degree of thoroughness and 
regularity." , 

He said the papers are "devoid 
of the attributes traditionally as-
sociated with student newspap-
ers. In my opinion, they are not 
in:;truments for the dissemina-
tion of campus news and the 
expression of editorial opinion. 
Rather they have taken the char-
acter of media for the propaga-
tion " f radical political and social 
phi ' !sophies, the advocacy of 
anarl!hy and lawlessness, indoc-
trination of their readers with 
standards of human conduct which 
are generally unacceptable, and 
promoting disrespect for all au-
thority." 

They pointed out that recently ' 
"we have brought pressure to 
bear on the regents because of 
tuition, and on behalf of the 
faculty and tradItional campus 
autonomy. It is to be hoped that 
a political investigation w1ll not 
take place under the guise of in-
vestigating 'obscenity' or fund-
ing." 

The extension of the investiga-
titsn to include bail funds was 
made at the urging of another 
regent, Mrs. Catherine Hearst. 
Mrs. Hearst, whose husband is 
a member of the famous news-
paper family, said "it does not 
sit well with the public" when 
student funds are used for bail 

,while. the university is cutting 
its budget generally. 

The investigation is apparently 
a reaction to a decision by thE 
student government at the IrvinE 
campus to donate $500 to the ball 
fund for students arre sted at San 
Francisco State College. Students 
at Berkeley and Santa Barbara 
have also used money for bail. 

An alternative or subsequent 
proposal to Baer's was made by 
Tom Shepard, asking Dean Mur-
phy to change the Placement 
Center standards to prohibit any 
business that engages in unlawful 
activity from recruiting on cam-
pus. Then, through a judicial 
mechanism set up to determine 
such illegality, the Marines could 
be challenged under international 
law for their activities in Viel-
nam. 
. Although these seem to be the 
main options open, they are not 
the only ones. 
Chancellor McGill analyzed some 
of these alternatives. A dis-
criminatory recruiting pollcy 
without objective standards could 
not be defended legally, he said. 
However, he is seeking to draw 
up such a set of standards, such

ACADEMIC SENATE 

The following resolution was 
passed by a vote of 155 yes to 
17 no at the March 25 meeting 
of the San Diego Division of the 
Academic Senate: 
"It is a fundamental obligation 

of the academic community to 
IProtect the right of its members 
and their guests to pursue their 
legitimate' activities without 
being subjected to interference by 
physical means or disruptive tac-
tics. For the purposes of this 
resolution, legitimate activities 
are any activities not in con-
flict with existing University 
Regulations or Policies. The 
iacademic community has the res-
ponsibility and the means to deal 
directly with such interference 
when it occurs on University 
premises and originates with 
other member of the academic 
community. These means include 
!persuasion as well as disciplinary 
measures administered in ac-
cordance with th established 
IProcedures of due process. We 

~eem it essential that these 
measures be applied with deter-
mination and to whatever extent 
may be necessary for the pro-
ection of this fundamental right," Canaday also said the papers 

"abound in obscene editorial and 
pictoral content and they evidence 
little or no dedication to truthful 
and objective reporting nor any 
attempt to maintain editorial ba-
lance." 

AS Elections Slated Soon 
The regents asked President 

Charles J. Hitch to conduct the 
investigation and report back in 
June. Specifically, Canaday asked 
that the investigation include 
analysis of news and editorial 
content, the quality ofwr1tingand 
reporting, finances, "the adher-
ence to proper concepts of edi-
torial policy," the possib1l1ties 
of cutting off student fee s upport 
of papers, and "effective modes 
of university supervision," in-
cluding boards to review edi-
torial policy and plaCing the 
newspapers under the control of 
the journalism departments. 

The editors of six of the nine 
papers issued a statement in re-
sponse to the regents' move. 
" It would be unfortunate," they 
;aid, "if such a university in-
vestigation were used to intimi-
date the traditional freedom of 
the university's campus news-
papers." 

The Associated students of the 
University of California, San Di-
ego announced Thursday that the 
AS General election will be held 
on or about Tuesday, April 29. 

Positions to be fUled in the 
election include upper and lower 
division senate representatives, 
three Muir college and three 
Revelle college senators, AS 
Vice-President, and AS Presi-
dent. 

In addition, there are tentative 
plans to place three referendum 
issues before the stUdents. These 
issues are: the UCSD recruit-
ment pollcy, the campus athletic 
policy (especially with respect to 
preferential grants-in-aid to th-
letes), and th financing of the 
planned student center. 

Students interested in running 
for AS offices should pick up 
petitions of can<2idacy in th AS 
office (250 M.C.) starting Mon-
day, April 7. 

A student qualifies for candi-
dacy by returning these petitions 
by April 18, with the signatures 

of at least 5 % of the under-
graduate student enrollment at 
his college. In the case of the 
upper and lower division senators 
and the President and Vice-
President, petitions must contain 
5% of the total campus under-
graduate enrollment. 

Tom Shepard, ASUCSD Presi-
dent, stated th t under new senate 
by-laws, senators will have a 
clearly dilineated area of re-
sponsibll1ty next year and that 
they should expect tc spend at 
least 8 hours a week in these 
duties. 

Shepard emphasiz d the im-
oortance of these el ctions by 
noting that the scope of formal 
student involv m nt 10 th cam-
pus decision making processes 
has increased drastically in the 
last year, and lith students are 
to successfully respond to these 
new responsib1l1ties, th election 
of responsibl representatives is 
imperative. 

More information w1ll appear 
in next week's Triton Times. 



P ... 2 April 4 t 1969 

Today marks the first anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin 
Luther Kine Jr., the greatest black leader during the non-violent 
civil rlgllts period of American history. 

King, during his lifetime and after, has been both praised by the 
liberal and criticized by the radical. Yet he deserves recognition as 
the greatest mass leader of the black people during his lifetime. 

He began one of the most important phases in attempting to bring 
the black man his freedom-non violent resistance. "Tested in Mont-
gomery during the winter of 1955-56, and toughened throughout the 
South in the eight ensuing years, nonviolent resistance had become, by 
1963, the logical force in the greatest mass-action crusade for freedom 
that has ever occurred In American history." 

King's non-violent action was the principal tool used for many years 
in the black man's struggle for freedom. However, the effectiveness 
of this tactic began to diminish as advances were made in the bla-
tantly segregated South and as many of the Black Power movements 
developed towards the latter part of King's life. 

The assassination of King marked the demise oCeffective non-violent 
resistance and the beginning of a new stage of the black man's quest 
for freedom in America. King himself foresaw this, if not with a 
sense of concern: "I am further convinced that if our white brothers 
dismiss 'rabble-rousers' and 'outside agitators', those of us who 
employ nonviolent direct action, ' and if they refuse to support our 
non-violent eUorts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and 
despair, seek solace and security in black-nationalist ideologies-4 
development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial night-
mare." 

King saw many of the same evils in the white man's attempts to 
solve the "problem" as do the militants today: "I have been gravely 
disappointed in the white moderate. I have almost reached the re-
grettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his 
stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council or the Ku 
Klux Klanners, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" 
than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of 
tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice." What does the death of Dwight a Significant historical figure, it by the military-industrial com-

............................................................................ By Tom Baker 

Harris .. Orr Judged Too Harshl, 
Dear Editor: 

I hope you will allow a veter-
an of 49 years of teaching at 
major universities to comment 
on the news ite m, the editorial 
and the petition of graduate stu-
dents--all published in the Tri-
ton Times and all concerned with 
Professor Orr's inaugural lec-
ture. 

May I start by sayIng that 
I am not an enthusiast of Pro-
fessor Orr's brand of economics. 
ProCessor Milton Friedman of 
the University of Chicago, one 
of the most brilliant and per-
suasive econoinists of modern 
times, was his teacher. 

Friedman's major theme is 
that the free market, without 
government interference, should 
be the essential feature of our 
economics and our economic sys-
tem. As one who has devoted 
most of my academic lite to 
supporting the view that govern-
ment has serious responsibili-
ties in helping to achieve maxi-
mum growth, stability and Im-
proved distribution of income, 
I do not welcome the Friedman-
Orr brand of economics. 

I would also appraise Marx 
more highly than Orr. But . [ 
am not a Marxist. I am con-
vinced, however, that Marx Wa3 
a genius and I agree with my 
former friend and colleague--
a most conservative man -- Pro-
fessor Joseph Schumpeter, who 
insisted that Marx was the great-
est sociologist of all times. I 
also believe we ought to teachl 
Marxian ~conomics, though 
I would hope pro and can. 

Incidentally, one does not have 
to read vast amounts of Marx-
ian literature in order to test 
some of the universally known 
predictions of Marx. 

We brought Orr here on the 
basis of very strong recommen-
dations as an outstanding autho-
rity in microeconomics. His 
colleagues, I am sure, feel that 
our judgment has been more than 
vindicated. Our economic rra-
duate students, [ believe, also 
think highly of Orr. 

What we want Is not a mono-
lithic department, but represen-
tatives of all schools of thought 
and methodologies: Classicists, 
Fnedmanites, Marxists, Keyne-
sians, non-mathematical and 
mathematical economics. To 
many students mathematical eco-
nomics does not seem suUiciently 
relevant. Nor is it to the wri-
ter. But this kind of economics 
should have its spokesmen. Our 
task is not to win students over 
to a particuiar school of thought. 
It is rather to offer you all 
important alternatives , the final 
choice to be made by the stu-
dent. 

Now as regards the lecture. 
Unfortunateiy 1 had another uni-
versity obligation at the time 
of the lecture, and henee I was 
present only during the question 
and answer period; but I learned 
more from the Triton Times and 
from conversations with many 
present. (Not being present, 
I do not feel compe~nt to ap-
praise the whole lecUlre.) 

Let us assume that Orr's lec-
ture fiS not a great success. 
What teacher has not had a bad 
lecture? How many of our able 
teaching fellows who want to 
fire Orr have not expe rienced the 
bad taste that comes with an 
hour that just does not come 
off? The longer I teach, the 
more irritated [ become as bad 
sessions continue to be mixed 
with good ones. 

Reader Thinks Orr Lecture 
Proves Capitalism at its End 
Dear Editor, 

It s hou Id be obvious to all con-
cerned and thinking people that 
capitalism is at its dead end. 
Obse rve the spectacle of Daniel 
Orr, UCSD economist, trying to 
defend it. Yes, it is true that 
he is not defending a complete 
laissez-faire capitalist system. 
He Is defendinga mixed economy, 
that Is, part capitalism and part 
SOCialism. 

But just observe the fact that 
America is going down the tube, 
and it is attempting to take the 
rest of the world that it has 
exp loited with it. Since this 
Is the result of America being 
only semi-capitalist, can you just 
imagine what would happen If 
it were laissez-faire!? 

People throughout the world 
are homeless , sick and hungry. 
Meanwhile the capitalists live It 
up in their multi-million dollar 
industries. What do they care 
about starving Asians? And what 
would the capitalist do it he had 
no workers to make his money ' 
that he uses for his own sel-
fish ends? 

The poor of this earth did not 
create the conditions in which 
they subsist. ' It was a world 
they never made. Why should 
they sulfer while a few, greedy 
capitalists live it up? The tech-
nology and factories are here; 
they s hould be used for humani-
tiarlan purposes, not private pro-
fit. Need comes tlrst. Need, 
not greed I always say. Any-
one who does not recognize the 
fact that each man is his brot-
her ' s keeper is a kind of un-

feeling, political reactionary, a 
man who places property rights 
above human rights . 

Those In need should be our 
main concern. Some doubting 
smarties say that I can't defend 
self-sacrifice in reason. But 
what is the power of reason? 
Just ask yourself how many times 
you have reasoned incorrectly 
and the answer to that question 
will be self-evident. 

To s olve the problem of human 
suffering we need s omething 
more than cold, impersonal ra-
tionality. We need tolee!. Com-
passion and love are Ceelings. 
By loving all men as our equals, 
we become brothers, all in one 
human family whose purpose is 
mutual happiness and under-
standing. 

Those who seek material goods 
while others suUer keep the poor 
where they are. The collective 
community is the only solution. 

The common good 01 all man-
kind s hould be the purpose of 
our lives. Self-sacrifice is the 
means to this end. Those capi-
talist-imperialists don't give a 
hoot in hell who they destroy, 
just as long as they make a 
buck. Mone) is the root of most 
evil. This may be a bromide, 
but· It's true, Isn't It? Millions 
of people can 't be wrong, can 
they? 

Don't be sellish; be a brother, 
- not a mother. To those of you 

who continue to take this kind 
of treatment all I can say Is, 
brother you asked lor It! 

Sincerely, 
Nathan Prichett 

By the way, 11 we had to de-
pend only on those who have 
read the three .tough volumes of 
-Das Kapital-, we would have 
little Marxist economics taught 
here. 

One final word. [was shocked 
by the behavior of some of the 
students at the lecture. I could 
scarcely believe that these are 
the same bright, decent, cooper-
ative and conscientious students 
that I have in class. Even 11 
as the Triton Times says Orr 
provoked the students, the res-
ponse was not delens ible. In-
cidentally, provoking students to 
disagree is one of the earmarks 
of a great teacher.

Apology Due 
Dear Editor: 

May 1 add two footnotes to 
my letter on the Orr lecture. 

First Professor Orr and 
another colleague think that I 
exaggerated Orr's commitment 
to the free market economics of 
Professor Friedman; second, and 
more important, I now have had 
an opportunity to read Orr 's lec-
ture. I would appraise it high-
ly. The community owes Pro-
fessor Orr an apo logy for not 
allowing him to present his paper 
under tolerable cor.ditions.

COURSE 
OffERING 

Dear Editor: 
I wou ld like to ca 11 to you r 

attention the addilion of the fol-
lowing course offering for spring 
quarter, 1969: "Race in Amer -
ican Life " . This is an inter-
diSCiplinary course offered by 
Muir College under the Conte m· 
porary Issues program. 

It was developed by the Com-
m Ittee on Courses oC Contempor-
ary Social Concern, the Subcom-
mittee of the Academic Senate 
on Educational Policy. The Aca-
demic Senate had specifically 
charged this committee with the 
res ponsibility for preparation of 
such courses for this coming 
quarter. 

The cours e will include lec-
turers from variou departments 
within the UCSD campus , lec-
turers from other UCcampuses , 
and from community worke r s in 
the San Diego area. It will 
also include representation fI om 
persons involved in active po-
litical org-anization in the com-
munity. 

Among the on-campus lec-
turers will be Profess or s Car -
mack, Parris h, Gus fJe ld and 
Lowe. 

The course will be given for 
three units credit and will meet 
from 4- 5: 30 pm on Wednesdays 
and Fridays in room 2622 in 
the Undergraduate Sciences 
Build ing. It will be li sted in 
the s upplement to the pring 
quarter time schedule. 

The course s hould prove an 
effective means for Ins truction 
and dlscusslon in an area of 
vital current social issues. 

Sincerely, 
Joseph R. Guslleld 

The controversy surrounding the policy of admitting military recruit-
ment personnel to this campus continues . The students who pre-
vented the Marines from recruiting here last quarter face the pros-
pect of some sort of disciplinary reprisal. Further, in an attempt 
to end debate, the Chancellor has proposed a student refer endum on 
the question of recruitment. 

We take issue with this proposed refer endum for several r easons . 
First, as McGill has structured it, the " choice" is illusory. He 
has insisted upon ?nlytwo alte rnatives appearing on the ballot, namely, 
totally open recrUltment to all "legal" agenCies, or e lse no r ecruitment 
at all. 

The ,AS Senate is considering on its own a refe rendum which con-
ceivable would include other alternative possibilities. Howeve r, McGill 
refuses to allow a referendum wllOse alternatives ar e broader than 
his own. ThUS, the AS Senate will eUher have the referendum as 
approved by McGill or none at all. 

The most important alternative is barred from the ballot - that 
of allowing r ecruitment from agencies other than the military. This 
alte rnative must appear if there is to be any meaningful expression 
of student opinion. Without it, the referendum is a fake similar to 
allowing "free elections" in a contest whose candidate~ have been 
hand-picked by the com missar. 

Further, it is me re delusion to believe that the results of such a 
r eferendum would be binding upon the administration. As worded , 
the r eferendum would be used to decide whether student funds should 
be used to finance the r ecruitment programs, not whether there will 
be r ecruitment. ThUS, it appears that recruitment will continue 
regardless of the outcome of the r efer endum. We should not be led 
to believe that students have the power via the referendum to alter 
the pre sent policy. 

However, the issue Is deeper than these pragmatic considerations. 
At the root of the controver s y is the war in Vietnam. By cooperating 
with the military in providing men fo r its officers corps, the policy 
of allOwing military r ecruitment on campus is essent ially one of 
tacit approval for genocide in Vietnam. 

To hold a r eferendum on a Question which is fundamenta lly that of 
the war in Vietnam is to grant that war a civUity it does not dese rve . 
The brutality in Vie tnam is not a question open to debate among reason-
able men. Nor is it open to a r eferendum. 

The univers ity should not be a sanctuary from social reality. It 
s hould actively involve itself in the affairs of the community and co-
operate with certain organizations within the society in ~ChieVlng 
legitimate social progress. 

However, certain associations with the more unsavory elements in 
SOCiety should be avoided. For example, the university community 
should guard aga ins t the growth of unwarranted tnfluence of the military 
in the conduct of its affairs . 

To a large extent, this influence already exis ts . Besides the current 
recruitment policy, the corporate me r ger of interests between univ-
ersity and milita r y Is r eflected by the fact that ce rtain professors 
on campus are engaged in r esearch on behalf of the Institute for Defense 
Analys is . This c reeping militar ism must be destr oyed. The growth 
of the Defense Society is pe rhaps the most dangerous threat to the 
possibility of ,establishing a free socie ty. 

F~r . these .r easons, we ur ge that the r eferendum be boycotted. By 
parhclpating lI1 this. r eferendum, we legitimize that which Is forever 
illegitimate , and narcotize our selves in rega rd to the extent of our 
power to abolish the present recruitment policy. Beware the Trojan 
Horse. 

Ethnic Value 
Dear Editor, 

The value of ethnic study pro-
~ams in the college curriculum 
has been met with little or no 
question. However, whUe the 
active elements of society de-
mand that every value should be 
critically examined, no book 
should be left unburned. 

Since ethnic studies involve the 
study of the cultures of differ-
ent racial groups, It might be 
best to define culture. Es sent-
ially, culture is what separates 
man from the rest of the ani-
mal world. Although the care-
ful animal observer will be aware 
of animal rituals and hierarch-
ies which approach, if not sy-
nonymous with, human cus toms 
and of the expressed communi-
cation of animals , there wUl be 
no elaborate extremes such as 
language and words, politics, r e l-
igion, social interactions , phil-
osophy, and tbe arts and sciences: 
in other words, the constituents ot 
culture. Most Important, the 
observer wltl not see In the ani-
mal world the costly and non-
productive inter- specific conflict 
which is peculiar in only human 
aggression. 

Is there any re laUon b tween 
this type of conflict and cul-
ture? Historically, this type of 
conflict does exist and usually 
involves one group's cultural as-
sertion over another's. This is 
especially tacilltated by pecul-
iarities in religions, social 
mores, politics, philosophies and 
with language as the catalyst. 

Most of the examples of the 

conflicts are obvious. For ex-
ample , there a re the Civil War, 
the American white' s a s sertion 
against the Indian and his sup-
pression of black African cul-
ture. Hitler 's assertion of a 
super race supported by the ideas 
of nazism led to the extremely 
wasteful conflict oC World War 
n. Korea, Hungary, Vietnam, 
Cuba, Berlin, and Czechoslovakia 
are only a few example s of the 
costly and potentially devastating 
political philosophical - social 
contlict between capitalist and 
Marxist or Wes tern and com-
munist cultures. Aiso, one can 
include the Arab- Israeli connict, 
Black Power , and, perhaps the 
mos t flagrant of contemporary 
examples , the complete sup-
press ion of anc1ent Chinese cul-
ture and the institution of Mao's 
pr ogressive communism on the 
Oriental mainland. 

Therefore , it, as it appears, 
ther e does exist a relation be-
tween cu lture and humans ' pecul-
iar conflict, then the value of 
culture Itself can he questioned. 

But man can learn from him-
self and studies which pr esent a 
body ollcnowledge aXlut cultures 
are relevant. HOIl eve r , ethnic 
studies have not beeu approached 
as merely a well 01 knowledge, 
but is be ' ~ r .. ~ ~ "'}' .... thll-
s ias tic elements a the r a llying 
point for further action. Their 
enthusiasm is too similar to what 
has been called mUltant enthu-
Siasm, which has always pre-
c ded the violence of nonprod-
uctive human conflict.

Earthquake Expected to 
Rock California Today 

From various sources this past 
week has come the predictiOl 
that a mammoth earthquake will 
hit southern and central Calif-
ornia on Friday, April 4 from 
3:30 to 4:30 p.m. 

The prediction came indepen-
dently from a large number of 
astrologers, clairvoyants, palm 
artists, fundamentalists, eight 
different mystic sects, oneirom-
ancers, numbeerologists, mag-
icians, herb doctors, oracles, 
entrail deviners and disk jockeys. 

According to these sources, a 
good part of California including 
Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and 
San Diego will fall into the Pac-
i!ic and be submerged. Although 
these predictions have been vig-
orously denied by seismologists 
at Cal Tech who have been re-
ceiving hundreds of phone calls 
and letters about them, several 
recent signs seem of omin-
ous portent. 

One Is the ancient Hopi In-
dian prophecy quoted recently by 
the L.A. based SOCiety of thE 
Infinite Mind: "heavy rains, 
oil upon wate r before the (tidal) 
wave." The allusion to recent 
flooding and to the Santa Bar-
bara 011 slick seem unmistak-
able. 

Another ominous sign is the 
recent death of San "Andreas" 
Wilson at age 80. Wilson, a 
former prospector, had been 
living (or ~ forty years on a 
shack east of Ocotillo Wells 
on top of the southern end of the 

Saint Andreas Fault (the fault 
responsible for California's 
large quakes.) 

ln an interview in Time in 
1961, Wilson was quoted as say-
ing: "I been (sic) through the 
first quake, the San Francisco 
one. And I said to myself 
'the next one's going to be a big 
one, awful big.' So atter the 
mine closed down I came down 
here to the shack and I dis-
covered her secret. By golly 
that earthquake hasn't come yet. 
And she won't long as I'm set-
tin' right here." 

Although the so-called" scien-
tific minds" may scoff at such 
colorful examples the fact is that 
even scientists are uneasy. The 
entire seismology department ot 
the California Institute of Tech-
nology Is attending a "con-
ference" in Washine;ton during 
the week of April 4 and a lead-
ing seismologist who wishes to 
remain anonymous admits: 
"There's something in the air 
I don't like." 

The seismographs here have 
been making skittery little jumps 
every now and then as if they 
were practicing for something 
big." 

To get a more detailed scien-
tific opinion of the situation this 
paper interviewed a seismologist 
on a visiting research grant at 
San Diego State College, Dr. 
Eugene Kruller. Excerpts follow:

Chemist finds Method 
to Synthesize Phlogiston 
The UCSD Department of Geo-

chemical Studies announced yes- . 
terday that famed nobel prize 
winner Linus Pauley has, after 
years of painstaking research, 
succeeding in synthesizing phlog-
iston, the universal subst ance of 
heat content. 

The accomplis hment "as im-
mediately hailed by sci ~mtists 
around the world as tn ly one 
of the greatest scientif: c <l1s-
coveries of modern histor y'. 

Sc ientists have long h ipOthe-
sized that the temperatU! e of a 
body varied in direct pro )ortion 
to the amount of phlogistlln pre-
sent, but until recently ha';e 
been unable to measure the act-
ual weight losses due to a loss 
of phlogiston in cooling objects. 

However, Pauley was able not 
only to certify the existence of 
phlogiston, but was able to det-
ermine its composition by using 
the new sophisticated neutron 
electrocardiograph in Urey Hall. 

The PhlOgiston Theory was 
Ilrst formulated bv George E. 

stahl (1660-1734), professor of 
medicine and chemistry at the 
University of Halle, Germany. 
His tirst account of the theory 
appeared in his "Experiments, 
Observationes, Animadversiones 
Chymical et Physicae" (1697). 

In the nineteenth century a 
rival theory developed, known 
collectively as the firs t and sec-
ond laws of thermodynamiCS.

ha ve even attributed h\:!a l to an 
increase in the motion of mole-
cule s in a s ubstance, but this 
has never been substantiated in 
any way. 

In an interview with the Times, 
Pauley revealed that he has re-
ceived several commercial 
offers to market the synthetic 
phlogiston. General Dynamics 
of Norfolk, Virginia, is inter-
ested in using the substance In 
children's toys such as "super

iston as a tactical weapon. 

of a very large earthquake due 
to hit Californta on April 4?" 

(Kruller) - "I think people 
have been expecting earthquakes 
to reoccur periodically instead 
of unpredicaiably as they do in 
fact occur." 

(TT) - "What were the. dates 
of the previous California earth-
quakes?" 

(K) - " It is believed that the 
st. Andreas Fault, which inci-
dentally was named for a Port-
uguese friar who was burned at 
the stake for supposedly caus-
ing the Lisbon quake of 1740, 
is 5 million years old. Un-
doubtedly it has been causing 
quakes for most of this time. 
However there have been only 
four first order California earth-
quakes in recent history ••• these 
Occurred on Jan. I, 1806, Feb. 2 
1867, and March 3, 1908. The 
last of these was the so-called 
San Francisco earthquake al-
though its center was closer to 
Santa Barbara. I think you can 
see that there is no pattern or 
period to these dates, the first 
two being 61 years apart and the 
last two 41 years." 

(TT) - "Could a severe earth-
quake result in California falling 
into the ocean, as a well-known 
cartoonist has drawn it?" 

(K) - "DeIlnitely not. How-
ever geologists believe that a 
severe enough quake could result 
in California sinking and the 
ocean falling into California. I 
personally doubt that this will 
happen in April." . 

(TT) - "Why do you doubt 
this?" 

(K) - II Let me ask you this --
why does your newspaper take the 
threat of a quake so seriously?" 

(TT) - "Well, for one thing, 
many clairvoyants and astrol-
ogers are predicting it." 

(K) - "Nonsense, my astrol-
oger says that no such thing will 
happen." 

In preparation of the pre-
dicted quake the following univ-
ersity events have been planned: 

A bus will leave from the front 
of Urey Hall at noon Friday for 
Salt Lake City. Contact Jason 
Aurbach of the Muir Outing Club 
for reservations. Cheap shore-
line property can be purchased 
upon arrival. 

For those who remain, an orgy 
is planned for 3:00 p.m. at 
the Revelle plaza. Bring your 
own drinks etc. 

Afterwards the Religious 
Affairs Office will be sponsoring 
a special cram course, Salvation 
1A to be followed by baptisms 
at the fountain. The course can 
be taken only on a pass-fafl 
basis. No registration cards

a joint partiCipation in all as-

Summer Reading 
Program 8egills 

Tbe philosophy that education 
is a continuing process will be 
applied quite literally in the fut-
ure at UCSD. It was announced 
this week that aU returning UCSD 
students will be required to ful-
fill "Summer Reading Require-
ments. " this will consist of 
a mandatory reading list of five 
books, with another five to be 
chosen from a list of 100 titles. 

The announcement was made by 
the Committee on Educational 
Extension of the UCSD Faculty 
Congress, and stated that the 
purpose of the new program is to 
enabl~ students to take advantage 
of the summer months in expand-
ing their knowledge. 

Among the required books are 
"Rise and Fall of the Third 
Reich," by William Shirer, which 
is included to give students a good 
historical perspective and insight 
into one of the most important 
totalltarian movements of the 
century, Also chosen was Tol-
stoy's "War and Peach" which 
gives students a balanced view 
of an alien culture which they 
are not familiar with. 

One paper will be required, 
not to exceed 15 pages, and an 
examination will be given in 
Sept., which will be weighted 
according to years of college 
completed by the student. 

The university provost has anp 
nounced that two units credit 
will be given upon satisfactory 
completion of the program, and 
than a passing grade will be 
a prerequisite for readmittance 
in Fall Quarter. 

Dr. Enrich Braine olthe Meta-
pyysics Department told the 
Times that the students should 
take the summer program not 
as an added burden, but as a 
real opportunity for academic 
fulfillment. 

ved ptans for an experiment in 
communal living that would help 
translate this doctrine inte real-
ity. 

Beginning in May, dorm suites 
will be apportioned as follows: 
two freshmen, two sophomores, 
two juniors, two seniors, one 
t4culty member, and one admin-
istrator. 

The latter two will be volun-
teers from the academic com-
munity. To make room for 
them some 200 students will have 
to be moved into temporary 
quarters in the new stratford 
Court Apartments that have just 
been built behind Miramar Mem-
orial Hospital. 

The experiment is expected to 
run for three weeks, after which 
time all participants will fill out 
lengthy questionnaires, from 
which the success of the program 
will be determined. 

Provost MacGfll and Chan-
cellor Saltmen have expressed 
keen interest in the experiment. 
Dean of Student Discipline George 
Muirphy said that he hopes all 
parties involved would make an 
honest attempt to understand each 
other. 

The new room assignments are 
currently being determined by the 
UCSD computer. All students 
are expected to get in touch with 
their Resident Assistants by the 
end of the month to find out the 
results. It is expected that some 
attempt will be made to match 
participating professors with 
those enrolled in their classes. 

Clyde Hermansky, president 
of the joint Interdorm CounCilS, 
revealed that plans for the next 
school year include an experi 
ment in co-educational living. 
Two phases are currently for-
seen: co-educational suite liv-
ing, and co-educational room oc-
cupancy. 

There has been some trouble 
getting the plans approved by the 
administration, but answers to 
questionnaires sent to parents 
of UCSD students have proved to 
be optimistic. 

The Academic Senate's Curri-
cula Committee is considering 
sponsoring a two- quarter se-
quence, which would be entitled 
Sex Orientation lAo-B, in con-
junction with the experiment.

UCSD Ated School to Initiate Extended 
Program for Atinority Students 

The UCSD School of Medicine 
has developed and will inittate 
a new and specially-designed ex-
tended (five-year) program for 
the next academic year. 

Dean Clifford Grobstein stated 
that the program is intended to 
appeal to minority group mem-
bers of high potential but with 
remedial academic deficiencies. 
Up to five student applicants to 
the program may be enrolled to 
supplement the 48 regutar mem-
bers of next t411's class. 

Considerations underlying the 
program include the widely-held 
view that becoming a physician 
requires demonstrated academic 
brilliance and great financial 
support. This image, prevalent 
at both high school and college 
levels, Inhibits many students 
from approaching the profession 
of medicine. 

In the eyes of numerous stu-
dents in minority groups, a car-
eer in medicine appears to be 
all but impossible. Such stu-
dents, even when they have the 
potential for medical training, 
are often lost to the profession 
because they have had inappro-
priate counseling and inadequate 
opportunity for cultural, econo-
mic, or educational advancement. 

The new program is viewed as 
exploratory and subject to modi-
fication in light of experience. 
It provides for recruiting and 
enrOlling at least five candidates 
who will immediately upon 
admission assume the status of 
bona fide medical students for 
course of study leading to the 
M.D. degree. _ The five-year 
period specified is not rigid but 
may be altered to suit the pace 
set bv the student himse If. 

EaCh student will work with 
his own preceptor and tutor with 
whom he will devise an indi-
vidualized, tailor- made course of 
study to make up deficiencies. 
The resultant curriculum will be 
highly flexible to meet student 
needs and will embody from the 
outset a mixture of medical 
school and campus-wide courses. 

Qualified students will ' be 
promptly notified of their admis-
sion and encouraged to matri-
culate at UCSD in June 1969. 
Advisors will jointly arrange 
screening examinations in che-
mistry, biology, mathematics , 
English, and other subjects as 
approprtate. Screening will 
occur shortly after students ar-
rive. 

A generously-wide variet of 
courses will be available along 
with special tutorials and labor-
atory activities. No specific 
deadline has been established for 
the student 's introduction to the 
regular medical school courses; 
the transition will occur at a time 
compatible with the evolving 
competence of the ind i vidual stu-
dent. 

For students lacking a bacca-
laureate degree, assurance must 
be given by their former coll-
ege that such a degree will be 
conferred upon successful com-
pletion of three quarters of study 
at UCSD. OtherWise, provision 
will be made insuring students' 
eligibility for the baccalaurate 
degree at UCSD. 

The broad goal of the program 
is to recover for the medical 
profession students who by the 
usual criteria are not ready for 
admission to the School of Med-
icine but who, by other criteria 
and through the provisions ofthis 
program, can be made available 
to meet urgent needs.

Last week, Governor Reagan 
contended that a man's political 
philosophy should be a criterion 
for his employment as a teacher 
in CaUfornia's college and univ-
ersity systems. 

Reagan said that a prospective 
teacher's political philosophy 
"must be a consideration in hir-
ing" because of an existing "one-
sided ideological viewpoint" 
among faculties. 

Opposition to this contention of 
political philosophy as a hiring 
factor came from both the college 
and university offiCial faculty 
groups as well as a few Regents. 

Considering appllcants' poli-
tical philosophies" would open 
the door to prejudice ," UC Pres-
ident Charles J. Hitch said. He 
obse rved that the State Consti-
tution requires UC to be "en-
tirely independent ot all poli-
tical or sectarian influence and 
kept free therefrom in the ad-
ministration of its affairs." 

State College Chancellor Glenn 
S. Dumke, usually a strong Rea-
gan supporter, said a professor 

should be hired on the basis of 
his professional qualities and 
accomplishments. "If you do 
that you're not going to have to 
pay attention to his political ideo-
logy," Dumke added. 

DeWitt A. Higgs of San Diego, 
chairman of the UC Regents, 
called Reagan's proposal "ter-
ribly dangerous." "Once one 
starts testing a man's political 
views as a criterion for employ-
ment at the university, it is no 
longer a place where all views 
can be expressed." 

Dr. Randolph T. Wedding, head 
of UC's statewide AcademicSen-
ate, said Reagan was incorrectly 
implying that politics already 
plays a part in hiring professors 
and that teachers politically in-
doctrinate students. "But to 
start to use the governor's crit-
erta would insure that both would 
become true," Wedding said. 

While Reagan manufactures 
these political myths about high-
er education, recent polis show 
him gaining in popularity among 
California voters.

Regents Take Control 
On March 20 and 21 the Re-

eents of the University of Cali-
fornia met in Los Angeles in 
their monthly meeting. The main 
theme of the meeting seemed to 
be an attempt on the part of 
some Regents to recentr;llize the 
university with the Reeents tak-
ing back some of the powers which 
have previously been delegated, 
as well as assumingresponsibil-
ity for things which they have 
never had jurisdiction over. 

The most significant order of 
business seemed to be two 
amendments to the standing or-
ders of the Regents. The amend-
ments were proposed by Regent 
Edwin Pauley. 

The first would take away 
from the chancellors the power 
to make the appointment of "fa-
culty members to ranks of As-
sociate Professor or Professors 
(including equivalent ranks) and 
employees having security of em-
ployment" and piacing it back 
in the board. • 

The second amendment would 
do the same thing for over-age 
appointments. 

The main contention of those 
who favored the amendments 
seemed to be a mixture of tra-
dition - it worked before, and 
somehow the chancellors have 
abused their power although no 
specific case could be mentioned. 

Regent Rafferty stated that 
when the old system (which the 
amendments would return the 
university to) had been in effect 
the university had run smoothly. 
Reagan agreed and mentioned 
that the present system had been 
abused. He also insisted that the 
present move, if made would in 
no way be political. 

When the Governor said this 
Regent Roth responded by saying 
that if the move were made it 
would certainly be interpreted 
as political and most certainly 
would be. He stated that in six 
hours of executive session over 
the Marcuse issue all the Re-
gents did was "talk about the 
man's political beliefs". 

President Hitch responsed to 
the amendments by stating that 
the old system was not working 
well and that a return to it 
would seriously overburden and 
make more difficult the process 
of recruitment and he questioned 
whether the Regent's could make 
better decisions than are being 
made under the present method. 
He also questioned the motivation 
behind the amendments on Paul-
ey's part. 

Regent Boyd made the points 
that the system had not been 
abused, that the amendments 
would weaken the position oC the 
chancellor s on their respective 
campuses, and handicap recruit-
ment. He also said that if the 
Board gave the impression to the 
academic world that it must 
screen the faculty (with political 
implications) it would discourage 
many outstanding scholars from 
coming to the University of Cali-
fornia. 

Regent Monagan (speake r of the 
Assembly, replacing Jesse Un-
ruh) said that " the Regents should 
have the guts to stand up and 
say that this will be a great 
university, and if we take these 
actions our position wlll be dam-
aged." 

Finally, after about an hour of 
confusion as to actually what was 
being voted upon and what vote 
was needed to pass the motion 
in question, whatever it was , the 
Regents who supported the 
amendment didn't have enough 
votes to pass it and Regent Paul-
ey "graciously" withdrew the 
motion. 

In addition to the question of 
rescinding their delegation, Re-
gent Canaday brought in a state-
ment concerning student publi-
cations . He feIt that the news-
papers on the various campuses 
were going in the wrong direction 
and that an investigation was 
necessary.

Editor, The Union: 

Many young people haven't the 
slightest idea of the real dan-
gers in marijuana. They have 
confidence In those who say that 
its use isn't as harmful as smok-
Ing a cigarette or taking a drink 
of alcohol. 

While marijuana is not addic-
tive to the same degreeasdrugs, 
there is a psychological effect 
from taking a drug of any kind, 
which fiUs a person with so much 
self- loathing that he can almost 
never recuperate from this feel-
Ing within his subconscious mind. 

The reason for this deep psy-
chological reaction is that the 
drug itsell represents to the 
subconscious mind the basest and 

ever 
conceived by man; thoughts which 
we dare not even put into words 
in our conscious mind. 

So, when an individual decides 
to be a party to the drug, his 
subconscious knows that he has 
given in to the very lowest part 
of his nature. 

I believe it to be true that 
marijuana is a special kind of 
plant put on this earth to tempt 
man, as Adam was tempted in the 
Garden of Eden. 

As Adam was given a choice 
of living in beauty and enlighten-
ment so now do we have a choice 
of living on a high plane or grop-
ing in the dust and grime of our 
own making.

The clnter for Participatory E-
ducation was originally estab-
lished as a result of the convo-
cations held after the November 
meeting of the Regents of the U-
nlversity of California. At that 
meeting credit was withdrawn 
from Social Analysis 139x, after 
that course had been passed 
through the Board ofEducatlonal 
Development and then approved 
by the Committee vn Educational 
Polley. ' 

In other words, the Regents of 
the University of California with-
drew from the faculty their tra-
ditional authority of formation of 
curricula. Because this decision 
was based on the opinion of the 
Regents that Eldridge Cleaver 
was not up to their standards as 
a lecturer after the Berkeley fa-
culty had approved ot Cleaver 
through the normal charmels, the 
Regents also threatened the other 
traditional faculty perogative of 
choosing their own colleagues. 

For a week there were cries 
of "political interference"., de-
mands for "relevancy" in uni-
versity education, calls for cour-
ses on topics of current social 
importance. There was a great 
deal of excitement in those days 
last winter. Several people risk-
ed their academic careers by 
their involvement, but finals got 
to the m as we II, and interest died. 

The faculty, too, were agitated. 
They establic;hed a subcommittee 
on courses of current social Im-
portance. They promised a cour-
se on "RaCism in America" 
which is being offered now In the' 
Spring quarter. 

Two long range projects were 
initiated by students. One was the 
Critical University Project spon-
sored by the Students for a De mo-
cratic Society. The other was the 
Center for Participatory Educa-
tion, an autonomous standing 
committee ot the AS Senate of 
UCSD. 

When It was established, CPE 
was primarily concerned with 
initiating new courses, seeking 
for the elusive, multi-deUnedre-
levancy in university education. 

InterQ~t in initiating new courses 
waned (the Regents could not have 
picked a better time to wt hdraw 
credit trom 139X, nobody stayed 
agitated long when finals were on-
ly two weeks away.) Those per-
sons working in the Center are 
working on courses that interest 
them--crHlcal courses on the ed-
ucati0£lal system itself. 

In our preUminary investiga-
tions, we have found that not only 
the university. bUt the entire ed-
ucational system needs to bere-
vamped. We ,all have vague no-
tions as to what education should 
be, I.e. the development olthe a-
bility to think crltlcalIy and in-
dependently, ot" in other words, 
educatlon should free the Indlvl-
d\l3.1 In each man. This Is not what 
th, educational system now (1005, 
it Is what it should do. 

From experience in American 
education one should be able to 
see wha.t the educational system 
does. Education Is the Institution 
which lies at the focus of the 
confilct between the development 
of the human Individual and the 
enC:IIJ l lr.\ : io)!l of a member orso-
clety. The cllrr~'lt educational 
system Is slanted and Is ignoring 
to a great degree, individual de-
velopment , but engendering cul-
tural norms; malclngchlldren Into 
productive citizens, often at the 
loss of their spontaneity, curlv-
sHy, ~ud critical awar <:!ness . 

Becauseof this CPE Is no longer 
primarily Interested In initiating 
new courses, but In trying to 
make education more participa-
.tory. Critical thinking comes not 
from s tudying thoughts, but thro-
ugh active participation in the 
subject matter at hand. Indeed, 
"parttzlpatory e:lucation" Is a 
redundancy wh':!l1 one considers 
what education shonJ.1 be. 

CPE hopes to insur~ that edu-
cation happens in the university, 
and some of us hope to insure It 
in the fllementary and high SChOI)l 
-1.5 well . 

We hope to publish a seri'ls M 
;if'lcle;; on the university, and on 
educ:ltlon. This Is a task which 
should boggle the mind. The field 
of education is limitless, and all 
of its functions are so bter nla-

!~:l that one has a hard time dE' -
!Ining llmits of anyone ar:lcle . 

The following is areview oftwo 
books written by university pre-
sidents In the hope of revealing 
the "official" functions of' he u-

niVl~r5lty . Other papers may be 
"Grades, Diplomas, Fear,andA-
uthority under Academic Free-
dom," "Teaching Methodologies, 
University and Class Stratifica-
tion," and "Universities, BigBu-
slness, and Delense." 

We will not claim to be objec-
tive In our papers, because as 
stude nts, we are too involved in 
the problems. We will try to be as 
fair as possible. 

(The dissertation referred to above will appear in the near future)

"We discussed the matter with

stated Murphy. decllDlDg to dis-
close any sPecltlcs of the COD-

proposed an admlDistratlve

He is presently awalting their 
decision. 11 the students reject 
him handling their case, theywUl 
be referred to the Committee on 
Student Conduct composed of four 
faculty and four students. There 
the case w111 be presented through 
a statement of the facts agreed 
upon by both the Dean and the

to be little disagreement over

R.O.T.C. Progrzm. Thlsbrought . 
a fantastically disproportionate 
response from Mrs. Hearst as . 
well as a 45-minute flag-waving 
speech by Regent Brett which 
made R.O. T.C. the guiding force 
in the American way of life and 
saw it as the answer to the prob-
lems of discipline on our cam-
puses. 

Thus, be felt cutting ott the 
student funds would effectively 
close the center. OneofMcGUl's ' 
main concerns is the con-
sequences of a closed recruit-
ment policy on grants and con-
tracts from NASA. He esti-
mated that over 25 faculty mem-
bers would have their funds for 
basic (nonclassified) research 
cut off if military reCruitment 
was not allowed on campus as 
stipulated by NASA. He pre-
dicted the result of a referendum 
would have a large effect on his 
judgement on the future of the 
Placement Center. He plans to 
take these results to the Aca-
demic Senate. 

In explaining why only nine of 
the 80 students are being pro-
secuted. Dean Murphy empha-
sized that his object as Dean was 
,to initiate action against as few 
students as possible without ad-
mitting that the reguiations ofthe 
University are a sham. He noted 
that he had no basis for dis-
cipllDlDg those students not on 
the steps of the Placement Cen-
ter. 

President Hitch pointed out 
that that could not be the case 
because the university had a 
clause In its 1efense contracts 
which states that it must give 
appropriate credit for R.O. T.C. 
courses. No action was taken to 
reverse the action by the Aca-
demic Senate at Berkeley. 

The meeting wound up with 
nothing being actually resolved 
except that the university com-
munity got a look at the new 
Regents. The only one who really 
showed a strong side at all was 
Regent Monagan and the impres-
sion was at least not r epulsive.

Jazz Series Young Poets 
Will Blow Your Mind to Read Here 

A set of twins, using their 
voices as musical instruments •• 
an avant garde vibraphonist play-
ing in 19/4, 6/8 and 13/4 time •. 
a group that knocks notes out of 
a long list of wlerd instruments--
these are all ingredients of a 
jazz concert April 8 in the UCSD 
gym. 

The concert, featuring " The 
Sound of Feeling" plus "Emil 
Richards and the New Time Ele-
ment," will be presented by Univ-
ersity Extension. It is open to 
the public. 

The Sound of Feeling is made 
up of two female singers, twins 
Alyce and Rhae Andrece , and a 
male singer, Gary David, backed 
up by two bassists and a drum-
mer. Equally at ease with a Bar-
tok mode, an old English mad-
rigal or a Simon and Garfunkel 
song, the group employs eerie 
counterpoints, unison, two-part 
harmony and even microtones. 

Leonard Feather, the dean of 
jazz critics, said the group "was 
a walk through the musical uni-
verse. They sing Ilke avant 
gar de ange Is." 

The Los Angeles Free Press 
was even less restrained in its 
review of the group: "It is out 
of sight ... this group will really 
blow your mind ... they are too 
good to miss." 

Both David and the girls will 
ofter use their voices in place 
of instr uments, ooby-dooingthelr 
way through an upbeat "MyFav-
orite Things" then slip into 
"Morning Bright," an original 
composition by David. The songs 
may last anywhere from 30 sec-
onds to 15 minutes. 

Emil Richards plays an elec-
tric vibraphone, among otner 
things, and was called by one 
critic " among the leading fig-
ures in these new developments" 
(of innovative jazz) ••• "heextends 
the paiette of emotions which 
jazz music is able to render." 

Richards, long an associate of 
musician Harry Partch, is cur-
rently one of the buiest and most 
sought-after musicians in the 
country, according to Bert Tur-

\ 

ment. Turetzky is coordinating 
the course "Definitions in Jazz, " 
of which this concert is a part. 

Influenced by Indian and Or-
iental musiC, Richards Is appar-
ently unlimited when it comes to 
choice of instruments. He and 
his group have r ecorded with such 
"instruments" as Tibetian mouth 
organs, water chimes, sled 
gongs, thumb pianoes, mixing 
bowls, tuned waste baskets, 
camel bells, split logs, a wooden 
table and "boobams" (whatever 
they are). 

Richards and the New Time 
Element and the Sound of Feel-
ing make up the first of five 
concerts offered by University 
Extension as an exploration of 
jazz. Bert Hazlett's Dixieland 
Band is scheduled for the sec-
ond performance, in the gym on 
April 22. 

other featured artists to ap-
pear later in the quarter will 
include Archie Shepp, Big Marna 
Thornton, John Best, and Her-
bie Hancock. 

For series or individual tick-
ets for the concerts, all beg-
inning at 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday 
nights, contact University Exten-
sion on the Matthews Campus, 
UCSD. (453-2000, ext. 2061). 

Members of the UCSD !aculty 
and staff and their !ammes can 
roy tickets for the concert at 
student rates. They can buy 
series tickets for $6.00, indi-
vidual tickets for $2. Series 
tickets can be purchased at the 
University Extension Office, 103 
Matthews Campus, or, through 
April 8, at the Arts and Lec-
tures office in Urey Hall. 

Special Note: 
In connection with the jazz 

series, the AS is sponsoring a 
contest where the first 25 stu-
dents who come to the AS of-
tlce in building 250 Matthews with 
a typed list of the entertainers

On Aprll 15 at 8:00 p.m., thE 
poets Clayton Eshleman and Rob-
ert Kelly will read in the UCSD 
Art Gallery. This wlll be the 
fir st reading in a series of five 
to be presented this Spring under 
the joint sponsorship olthe UCSD 
Art Gallery, the Arts and Lec-
tures Committee and the Depart-
ment of Literature and Revelle 
College. 

The readings will attempt to 
present the poetry of the uncon-
ventional younger poets. Both 
Kelly and Eshleman are in their 
early thirties, but have published 
widely • . Eshleman is also known 
as the editor of the controversial 
literary magazine Caterpillar 
and as the translator of the 
revolutionary Peruvian poet 
Cesar Vallejo. Kelly has also 
published a novel, The Scorpions 
(Doubleday), and edited an anth-
ology of recent poetry A Contro-
versy of Poets. 

The Joint reading on April 15 
will be followed on April 22 by 
a readlDg by Ed Field, and on 
April 28 the poet reading wUl 
be Diane Wakoski. A fifth reading 
will occur in MaYi both the poet 
and date will be specified later. 
All of the readings will be held 
in the UCSD Art Gallery. 

Robert Rosenblum, art histor-
ian and professor of fine arts 
at New York University, will 
lecture on the "Historical Sty-
le s of Ingres". 

Dr. Rosenblum is singularly 
qualified to lecture on this art-
ist. Rosenblum's interests and 
scholarly accomplishments in-
clude 18th, 19th and 20th century 
art and have dealth with such 
varied problems as the art of 
the Pre-Rapha@lites and that of 
Jasper Johns. 

The lecture will be held on

Robert Kelly and Clayton Eshleman, at the Art Gallery April 15 

"They all said we were too 
loud. And then that comment 
about our 'thick, black sound 
shot through with sunburst and 
pinwhee Is.' 

That's no" way to describe 
music. Why can't they talk abou$-
the technical aspects of what 
we do? The tonal quality, the 
harmony, the effects of the in-
struments we use. 

Musical education in this coun-
try Is incredible - you get these 
music teachers who have never 
heard of anyone past Beethoven. 
Or maybe the 've heard the name 
stravinsky, but they'd never teach 
his music. As far as John Cage 
or Stockhausen, or any other 
contemporary electronic music 
or serious experimentsl sound 
goes, forget it. Mostpeopleknow 
nothing about it and don't un-
derstand it." 

Frank Zappa has a lot to 
say and he says it in his own 
way off stage and on. "We 
don't want to be loved I1ke the 
groups who just grind out the 
same stuff to please the crowds. 
1 said we were all-American 
bosy and I meant it in the sense 
that we have the pioneering spirit 
that supposedly made this sup-
possedly great country great." 

" 1 think the Mothers' main 
function Is that of an ugly r e-
minder." Zappa doesn't really 
blame people for notbeingfreaks 
just for not allowing freaks or 
creeps to happen, not allowing 
the imagination that is freak out 
or creeping, happen. He sees 
his music as an identity aid for 
the creeps by saying to them that 
somebody does care and recog-
nizE!s them for the good thatthey 

·lAP I 
Politics -- "Well,let'sanalyze 

it. The main way in which our 
pol1tical system Is vulnerable to-
day is the fact that it lacks wis-
dom and imaglnatiOll~ And these 
creeps, with these fantastic im-
aginations, are extremely useful 
revolutionary weapons." 

" I would suggest that every 
child who wants to see a revo-
lution take place does this: get 
hold of his parents and finds a 
way to mold their attitudes. And 
you mold the attitudes of your 
parents into enacting legislation 
that will be beneficial to the 
cause of you. Brainwash your 
parents. That's the only thing 
you can do until you get the vots." 

The music Is that of the 
Mothers of Invention and it is 
revolutionary In many senses. 

San Diego and UCSD seem to 
be coming alive all of a sud-
den with all kinds of things hap-
pening in the next few weeks.

and Sylvia Sleigh. 

The show presents works of

already signed the release, and 
Coach Stoner has alrflady moved 
to San Luis Obispo. 

This move was a promotion In 
academic rank for Stoner, and he 
will teach as well as coach at 
Cal Poly. 

During Stoner's years at UCSD 
he developed the varsity basket-
ball team and their schedule, 
got the freshman basketball team 
sta rted and taught P.E. classes 
as well. 

The progress of the Triton 
basketball team will help indi-
cate stoner;s effectiveness. In 
its first year of competition the 
Tritons had a .500 season. The 
following year, with a tougher 

schedule, the team was 12-13, but 
the betler competition saw the 
team mature under Stoner's guid-
ance. 

This year's team boasted a 
19-8 record, the best In the san 
Diego area. This was good enough 
to get the Tritons voted into the 
NAlA District nr Playoffs. Al-
though the team was eliminated 
in their !lrst playoff game, they 
made a strong comeback after a 
bad first half, dropping the con-
test only in the final minute of 
play. 

Nell stoner was also an ex-
cellent teacher. He taught P.E. 
classes in tennis, handball, 
squash and badminton. 

He helped the assistant athletic 
director deve lop the schedules in 
many sports, and UCSO offers 
more sports than even most big 
colleges. 

Stoner came to UCSO from Cal 
state Fullerton, where he had 
been assistant varsity coach. 

Wooden at UCSD? 
The UCSO physical education 

department confirmed reports 
that John Wooden of UCLA will 
replace Neil stoner as coach 
of the Triton varsity basketball 
team. 

Wooden said at a news con-
ference yesterday, "This is the 
opportunity I've been waiting for 
for years -- to really make it 
big in college athletics." Wood-
en called his successful Bruin 
carreer " ... just a prelude to 
what Is to come now that my 
big chance has arrived." 

Wooden plans to return to his 
famous pressing defense at 

Crew 
Team 
Wins 

Opener 

UCSD. "Although we will play 
most of the bit teams in the 
nation," he said, "I i maglne the 
team should be able to turn in 
two or three shutouts. Above 
all, however, we must not be-
come over confident if we are 
to wln the NCAA crown in 10 
years in a row, as I have plan-
ned." 

Next year's season will get 
under way against the tough Oly-
mpic team from Tibet. Wooden 
fears their awesome combination 
of skill and speed, which made 
them the chief contender for the 
Tibetan Basketball Championship 
(restricted to Tibetan teams). 

The following week will be 
easier, involving games against 
USC, Purdue and UCLA, Wood-
en's former team. "We will 
use these games to get in shape 
for our most important game of 
the season -- Cal Tech!" 

Traci 
The UCSO track team suffered 

their first loss of the season last 
saturday against Cal Lutheran. 
Most of the Triton's marks were 
lower than their previous per-
formances because of a muddy 
track and the Quarter break lay-
off. 

The next meet wlll be against 
the strong Cal State FUllerton 
team on saturday tomorrow on 
the UCSO track. Field events 
start at 1:00 p.m. and running 
events at 1:30 p.m.

Tournament history with victor-
ies over Davis, Berkeley and 
Riverside last week. The tour-
nament was hosted by the Tritons 
this year. Nationally ranked 
UCLA won the tournament, to 
no one's surprise, with UC Davis 
taking second.

Tennis 
Atter a two-week layoff the 

Triton tennis team was ill-
prepared for their two matches 
earHer this .week, and dropped 
both contests. Monday's contest 
against the University of Col-
orado indicated how the layoff 
had effected the team, as they 
were s hut out 0-9 . The Univ-
ersity of Wyoming was also vic-
torious in Tuesday's contest. 

The regular filth singles player 
for the Tritons, Bob Brown, was 
injured over vacation, and It is 
Questionable whether he will be 
able to play the rest of the year. 

Upcoming events included Fri-
day's away match with the tough 
Riverside team, Saturday's 
match against Pomona, and Tues-
day 's confrontation with rival Cal 
Western on our home courts at 
2:30 p.m . This latter contest 
should be sweet revenge for the 
Tritons, who have a beUer team 
than the Westerner s this year, 
but will by trying to avenge past 
drubbings by the usually power-
ful Westerners.

Third Co"ege 
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 

years Zapata continued to oppose 
the government from his home 
state of Moreles, and was sub-
sequently assassinated by a ~,,­
ernment agent. 

Chancellor McGill has res-
ponded to this proposal by is-
suing a statement to the press 
and by granting an interview 
with the Triton Times. The 
Chancellor feels that while 
"UCSD has been too slow in 
coming to grips with the edu-
cational responsibilities to min-
ority communities,' there is still 
a need to determine what forms 
of community action should be 
attempted by the Unversity. He 
be lieves th3.t the concept of serv-
ing a community should be care-
fully considered. 

While the plans may be 
referred to as "demands" Chan-
cellor prefers to consider them 
as "serious proposals ex-
pressing your (BSG-MAYA) con-
cern about Third College."; pro-
posals which will be examined 
carefully. As to the proposals 
concerning building contractors 
and student quotas, Chancellor 
McGill fee ls that they are pro-
bably in violation of either state 
or federal law. He believes that 
preferential treatment for the 
budget of the Third College could 
be used to starve the other col-
leges, and therefore he finds 
it unacceptable. 

He went on to state that he 
has little idea of the respon-
sibilities and activities of the 
proposed Board of Directors, 
and feels that Board domination 
of the FTE's would prove in-
tolerable to the teachers. He 
frankly stated that as far as he 
is concerned plans for the third 
college are too far along to be 
substantially changed. 

WILL YOU BE FLOWER PEO-
ple for mental health? (Yours ,

tal Health Month), San Diego will 
look like the Left Bank blos-
s oming out in a riot (excuse 
the expression) of flower stands, 
manned and womaned by students 
from San Diego colleges. 

Come brainstor m this plan and 
othe rs with us at the Friend-
ship Center, 3628 Fifth Avenue, 
Thursday, April 10, at 7:00 pm. 

(Note: ~o many students have 
requested information about 
mental health, careers in the 
field, how they can help, that 
we plan to hold one or more 
"brainstorming" sessions. We 
need their tresh ideas, their en-
ergy. They need to know that 
one out of every ten people will 
one day be treated for mental 
illness; that half of our hospi-
tal beds are filled by mental 
patients; that suicide is the se-
cond leading cause of death among 
college students; but that seven 
out of ten mental hospital patients 
can recover--with help. 

May is Mental Health Month. 
We want to acquaint the com-
munity with our/their needs. We 
hope to raise funds; to increase 
membership. There are also 
ongoing activities s uch as our 
Monday night social evenings.

As t() the proposed curr icul- . 

um, the Chancellor stated that 
the university spirit "precludes 
indoctrination" and that the uni-
versity should not engage in 
• 'teaching revolution or in pro-
selytizing for an idealogy ... ' 
concerning the nature of capit-
alism. 

He goes on to propose that 
we avoid restricting ethnic stu-
dies to the Third College by 
including Muir and Revelle in 
their plans. He also states that 
UCSD should provide minority 
educational opportunities in co-
operation with the local Junior 
Colleges, and that possibly a 
junior college could be built on 
the UCSD campus. Finally, the 
Chancellor calls for continu('d 
discussions in a peaceful and 
productive manner " to work for 
UCSD 's betterment and for 
changing its presently ineffect-
ive stance relative to its res-
ponsibilities for educating min-
ority students." 

statements concerning ' the 
Chancellor reaction and on the 
impending negotiations were sol-
icited from BSG-MAYA but none 
were made available. It is known, 
however, that discussions have 
continued and that both parties 
seem to be interested in continu-
ing the talks.

~*************** A RECRUITING TEAM FROM 
the Teacher Corps, Migrant Pro-
gram, of the University of South-
ern California will be available 
to talk with interested UCSD stu-
dents on April 7 and 8, 1969. 
They will be located in the old 
ice cream parlor of Blake Hall, 
Revelle College. 

The program is federally sup-
ported and aimed at students who 
have received a Bachelor's De-
gree in a field other than educa-
tion and who wish to become 
teachers of the disadvantaged. 

Commitment to living and 
teaching in rural poverty areas 
is one of the major criteria in 
the selection of applicants. Pre-
vious teacher education course 
work is not a prerequisite for 
admission to the program, but 
candidates must be United States 
citizens. Preference will be 
given to single persons or mar-
ried couples with no dependents. 

Candidates receive weekly sti-
pends and are exempted from 
tuition and other university fees. 
The two-year teacher education 
program leads to a master of 
science degree in education, the 
California teaching credential 
and certificate to teach English 
as a foreign language. 

Additional information con-
cerning this program is available 
at the Career-Educational Plan-
ning and Placement Center, Bldg. 
250 East Wing, Matthews Cam-
pus.
