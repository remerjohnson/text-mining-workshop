Financial Help for Grad 
Students Discussed 

Pradeep Kumar 
Whit graduate students 

constitute a significant part of 
th CSD student populatIOn , 
they are one student group 
who e interests have verv 
often been neglected The(r 
problems are two·fold, arl 109 
from their stature both as 
students and as employees of 
the Umver ity , 
Fir t. the are employed as 

teaching aSsistants, research 
assi tants , tutors, readers and 
language assistants The 
Umversity , according to Dr 
Roy Harvey Pierce, Dean of 
G radua te Studies and 
Rest'arch, does not consider 
them a wage·earner, but 
rather as apprentices Much a 
he would like the student to 
get at least mimmal decent 
fmanclal upport. he admitted 
that presently students arc 
employed at a quarter·lIm' 
salary for half·lIme work 

Outlook Not Good 
A cursory look at the fmannal 

situation for TA s wa s 
pre~ent d at the last meetmg of 
the CC D chapter of th 
,\merlcan FederatIOn of 
Teachers b\ John Mosher. a 
graduate student In hi tor\' 
Th nm ·month alan' for a 
half·tlme TA IS' 3447 
ConSidering the Increase 10 
tUition fees and th 
cost·ol·lIvmg fISC In the last 
three vears , dUring which 
there was no alan: hlk , he 
estimated a loss in their salary 
of about 780 Even th'e 
proposed alar\' mcreases 
proposed In the 1972-73 
budget for VC facult~', If pa sed 
on to grad students 10 some 
part. do not go far' enough 
toward re(,ouplng the loss in 
salar~' over the past thr e 
year , Mosher ald . 
. Th re IS a question as to 
whether the proposed l'C 
~alar.\' hike , If approv d. 
would be passed on to TA 's and 
other graduate student. In the 
past sal, r~' hikes have b en 
used to create more po itlOns 
b\ either redUCing the percent 
tIlne , 150 to 45% for examplel 
or b.\' havmg more quarter time 
appointments. 

Dr Pierce deSCribed some 
new proposals for finanCial aid 

to graduate students The fir t 
scheme call for , m lieu of all 
other f es, a dissertatIOn fee of 
about $150 per quarter ThiS 
proposal has be n mad by th 
gradua t student council of 
all th UC campu es. Thl fee 
IS uppo I'd to be umform 
Irresp ctlve of whether the 
student IS re Ident or 
non·re Ident In the casE' of 
leave of absence, the fee will 
have to be paid for a maximum 
of 10 quarter , excepting In 
case of what Dr Pierre 
described as "acts of God. ' 
pre umably Including 
slrkne"s, etc Th leave of 
absence I often of Critical 
Importance to some graduate 
stud nts . Often th student 
Simply can not afford to pay the 
fe s but would like to maintain 
. 001 relation hip With the 
Umverlt \ 
The other scheme provld s 
ome help to the re earch 

as Istants It attempts to 
Includ thc tUItion and 
out·of-. tat e fees In th federal 
contracts and grants the 
l'nlv r S lt~' receIves According 
to Dr PIerce, a large number 

of RA 's arc funded b\' federal 
contract: and grants and 
th refore thl propo al would 
mean substantial help The 
lederal agencIes, Dr Pierce 

sa~'·. have agreed onl~' on the 
conditIon that the 
state·supported contracts also 
Includ thIS provIsion Final 
approval also ha to come from

against a seg regated 
amusement park, In 1963, Dr ,

One million new adults

" Bel11g an adult feels no different 
than being a minor There are no real 
advantages," Tho e are the words of 
20'I'ear-old Chuck Graham , Muir 
SenIOr, as he reacted to the Adulthood 
Law which \lent Into effect on :\Iarch 4, 

On that date . more than one 11111110n

Cynicism and Liquor 
Thp nl'W adults howe\ (:1 hav ' 

reacled rather cynica lly to the new 
law , Leigh Christianson, an Diego 
Statc coed , explains, "Now we're 
responSible for finanCial matters, but 
we don 't have the money to back It up 
any how To us, adulthood means being 
able to buy iJquor " 

"The main thing IS , I slill can't buy 
BEER, " says John MacGregor. :'I1ulr 
JunIOr " The legislators are 
cncouraglng people to use 
:\lanhootchll' and other dangerous 
narcotiCS, because we can 't dnnk 
BEER We demand our righls to

A proposed amcndment to the. tate 
r nns ltutlon on loweflng the legal 
dnnklnl( age from 21to 18 was deleated 
In the State Senalt' .t the 1971 sessIOn 
But a ne\\ bill IS now under 
conSideration 

1\1aturity 
The adulthood statut I' was slgnl'd 

mto law at a Dec 14 ceremony by the 
governor, where he ment ioned that he 
wa well aware Ihat some people did 
not thmk per on between 18 and 21 
were "surtlclentlv mature" to meet 
the respon ibilltles of adu lthood 

This IS probably true in orne cases, 
Reagan said , but he added he also 
believed that " ome persons In the so-
called over·21 age group don 't 
necessa1'll\' conduct them el\'es as 
mature ad~lts ," 

In the same vem, Mark lIernandez , a 
~[ulr Freshman , remarked, " It's a 
glganllc relief. because , , [ wanted to 
escape the stronghold 01 m) parents 
As the law eXI ted before it was an 
Insult to our Intelligence 

But overall. the response to the la\1 
was qUill' cynical Perhaps Deborah 
Perluss, a San Diego State Ireshman , 
summed It all up when she said , " I 
don 'l feel a day over 18 "

omanovand Tudor 
Corrie Rickey 

A sample of some dialogue from one scene 
of the latest Franklin J , Schaffner 
extravaganza, "Nicholas and Alexandra :" 

<The Czar and Czarina are attend ing a ball 
10 honor of the czar's mother ", the room IS 
opulence epitomized with the draperies and 
chandeliers literally belching with 
decoration , ) 

Czarina Alexandra : " Nikki, may I say 
something intimate?" 

Czar Nicholas : " Here In public ? At a state 
affair?" 

Czari na Alexandra : " yes .. .. " 
(The tempo of the music is increaSing, 

Nicholas and Alexandra take two turns 
around the ballroom floor , ,J 

Czarina Alexandra : NlkkLI adore you ," 
The entire film is overflowing with such 

effusion and syrup, It was the author 's 
attempt, I gather , to " humamze" the czar 
and czarina and make them appear like two 
tragic figures 111 a Greek drama who were 
unable to e cape their fate 

The pair (played by Michael Jayston and 
Janet Suzman J come across like two 
stumbling children, rather like Rosencrantz 
and Gulldenstern : very much 10 the wrong 
play, 

But th tragedy of " Nicholas and 
Alexandra" IS that It IS not a parody , The 
film, which has many potentially good 
scenes, IS consistently ruined by scenes 
where Tom Baker, who plays Rasputm, falls 
to his feet In adulation of th royal pair and 
their bleeding hemophiliac son Baker more 
resembles Elliott Gould than Rasputin, and 
his sincerity seems about as authentic as the 
Timex ads where John Cameron Swayze 
Illustrates how the watche never stop 

However, the ab olutely unforgivable part 
of the film is the portrayal of the Bol hevik 
and Men hevik leaders , Kerenskv is cold , 
Implacable and absolutely assured that hi 
vocal cords are uperior to everyone elsc 's 
I As he demon trates several times , I Lenin I 
lifted 10 the shoulders of cheermg 
Bolsheviki , and he tightens his hand into a 
fi t. outstretches the fiSt. and shneks, to the 
crowd's delight , " Revolution , revolution 

, ~ " The happy Bolshev lkl reply With their 
own squcals of " revolution " It looked like a 
staged television demonstratIOn 

The photography wa very IlIC , If you're 
partial to perfectly shot colo! scenes and 
mce filters on everything , Technically , the 
film was flawless and there were a few 
scenes dealing with army maneuvprs thaI 
would have put Busby Berkeley to shame 

The film was, Imply, a very prejudiced , 
unsatisfYing history of 12 of the most excitl11g 
years of histo r\" It did have two excellent 
-upporting acting roles by Sir Laurence 
OliVier and Michael Redgrave as two 
p sSlmlst ic aides to the czar. The only 
redeeming part was the vel)' la t scene 
where the royal family was put to death as 
the White Roya list RUSS ians drew near to the 
site of the murders to save the czar , and 
the last shall go first. 

" Mary Queen of Scots" 
Continuing In the tradition 01 such hlstoncs 

as " Anne of the Thousand Da\,s" and " A ~1an 
for All Seasons," lIal Walils has brought 
to the screen the saga of King Henry V III , 
daughter and IlIcce, th film , "Mary , Queen 
of Scols " 

In the role of Mary , Vanessa Redgral'c 
plays the part 01 the b aUlIful queen whose 
heart changes Il'Ith the seasons She I~ 
('ol1tl11uall\' contrasted with tfle clearheaded 
Elizabeth Tudor, played by Glenda Jackson . 

I believe the pl'Omotional matenal for 
, ~lal'\' , Que!'n of Scots" compares thl' two 
qucens by sa)'lOg one ru l d With her head , 
and the other With her heart Glenda 
Jackson, a, the era mal monarch, explainS 
thiS 111 a clcvcr" done SCl'nt' \\fth TrcI'or 

Howard , who plays her minister Elizabeth 
contrived to have her own lover , Sir Robert 
Dudley, as well a her COUSin, Lord Darnley, 
go to Edinburgh and meet Mary of Scotland 
Elizabeth 's orders were that Dudley should 
marry Mary , but Mary of course would rebel 
against Elizabeth 's desi res and would not 
Mary chose Darnley instead , and Elizabeth 
triumphed With their mismatch Elizabeth 
laughs rather hollowly to her adVISOr. "That 
monarch is a lady lirst. and this lady IS a 
monarch first .. 

The film IS sup rbly acted , photographed , 
and costumed, however, there IS something 
ml sing from thiS film that was in the other 
historical films of late : good dialogue and 
c'1aracters that emerge from the screen In 
" Anne of the Thousand Davs," th conflict 
between lIenrv and Anne v.as ver\' heated 
and the actors·convinclngly feuded , 'In " ~Ian 
for All Sea.ons" the character of Thomas 

~10re was given excellent matenal through 
which to convel hiS role But 10 "~1aJ'\, 
Queen of Scots"-although both :\llss Jackson 
and MISS Redgrave act very well. their 
mateflal IS so weak that they cannot escape 
the history-book Image that are maintained 
in the film 

The conslant verbal Iromes are overplayed 
In the film lexample :\Iary relu mg to do 
something Elizabeth ha requ sted, and one 
frame later Elizabeth gloatm~ over the facl 
that Marv has done one of man\' disliked 
deeds arid It is really unfortu'nate that 
potentially uch an tncredlble film com off 
as slmplv mterestlnl1 

"Fiddler on the Roof" 
In the same Russia of Czar ;\lchola5, thrre 

were , 10 the l'kralnc , some JeWish peasants 
who , knowing that everything had a ble"l11g , 
blessed the czar by saYl11g , " ~Iay the Lord 
ble"s and keep the czar lar a\\ay from 
us 

:\'orman Jewlson 'Fiddler on the Roof 
brings such peasants life In hiS recent film 
adaptation of the stage musical 

In the role of Tevve I rae II actor Chalm 
Topol charmingly brIngs out the whimsy 01 
the Impovenshed JeWish ('ommunHI 01 
Anatevka 

The fdm deals with the marrymg off 01 
Tevye 's three eldest daughters and the 
concessIOns Tevye leels he has to make to hIS 
ddughters and 10 the changmg lImc~ that

that gUide hiS life

with him , she IS given Tel'ye's approval HIS 
third daughtcr marnes out of the faith , but 
h rc Tevye refuses to bend He Will not speak 
With or of her 

Although many decry the "hokyness" and 
tnteness of a Holll'wood musical. I think 
"Fiddler on the Roof" transcpnds Its g~nrl' 
l'nllke most mUSicals I and spectacle I 
where there IS a minimum 01 movemenl and 
an emphaSIS on what IS supposed to be 
"real ' rolol'. " Fiddler utilizes man\

I haven 't liked a mUSical since 
George hakins snapped hiS switchblade 
and fmgers, back In " West Ide Ston'," but 
"Fiddler on the Hoof" has gently wended ItS 
way to the scrcen and Jewlson 's 111m IS

Science and the Renaissance 
Man at Revelle 

l\'I ichacl Kaye 

Professor Harry Yang of the State University of New York at 
Stony Brook completed his undergraduate work in war-t ime 
Chma. Almost every other day , his classes were disrupted by 
Japanese bombing raids There was a scarc ity of texts and a 
dearth of even such elemental student necessities as notebook 
paper And some of the teachers were - by any standard -
positively horrendous, 

Looking back over that experience, Dr Yang doesn't bemoan 
the misfortunes, the hardships , the terrible stram, or the 
scholasllc ordeals of hi student day In all good conSCience, 
he flatly a~serts the value of adversity Though he nchly 
apprec iated the superb tu telage he later en joyed under such 
eminent masters as :Xorbcrt \\ !Cner and though he 
endeavors In all respects to be an exeell nt teacher hlmsell -
Dr Yang thlllks It deSIrable that good students should every 
now and then have to cope With wretched Instrucllon, With 
extremel\' difficult courses, and unrea onably exhaustive 
ass ignments For It IS In confrontmg and' successfully 
mastenng the " impossible " - It IS In tacklmg and subdumg 
overwhelmmg obstacles - it IS in gOing agalllst great odds and 
triumphing In the end that man hnds the true measure of 
himself. plumbs the depths of hiS lOner re ources, exerci es 
and extends to the limit hiS capacllles and potentl3l. and 
develops the seasoned confidence and Independence that come 
from bemg able to make the most of any c ircumstance 

At one time I thought Dr Yang · conclu Ions might owe 
morc than Just a little bit to the inscrutability of Oriental 
wisdom. But lateh' r ve discovered the same sentiments, 
expressed In Virtually Identical language, In the wntlngs of 
several strictly OCC idental thinkers For Insttlnce, Be rk ele~ 
biochem ist Dar\lel E Koshland observes ' ' 

In every unlver ity there IS usually a cours or two in 
which the student spend hours In the laboratory , work 
weekends and nights, lose sleep and overwork at the expense of 
oth r courses. It is traditional to curse the Incompetence of the 
deSigners of the course and the Immorality of the explOitatIOn 
Yet It IS these courses which s tand out year later I remember 
most dl. tlllCtiv what I learned In the class and the character of 
the other lIldlvldual who shared the ord al with me , Some in 
their moments of adverSity helped thei r colleague; generously 
In time and effort. Others, bent on solvlllg their own problems, 
monopolized source books and left equipment In di ·a rray , The 
Importance of fflendshlps lormed In dire penl has , of course , 
been observed many times, but I believe the Significance of the 
shared ordea l In J university edu('atlOn IS frequentl y 
overlooked Just as the (ducation and formal training of the 
('ollege pre!lare a student 101 subsequent life, so the SOCial 
cha llenge and moral challenges bccom preparation for later 
obstacles The terrors of the ' ImpOSS ible course' are 
surmounted, only to be replaced by new challengl's, With the 
same uneas} feeling In the pit 01 th stomach The new Job. the 
move to a ne\\ tow n, the step to propos a new theory , each 
produccs Its own wornes, but nOlI the worfles only serve to 
remind u. of past fears that prol'cd to be groundless 
H<lpPlllcSS has been dcfllled as till' construction of hurdles Just 
high cnough for one to Jump The l'nlverslty helped us ra!. e the 
lev('\ 01 thl' hllrdlp, and helped give us till' cllnlidcnce that we 

would be able to jump them "I Tbere Was Ligbt , IrVing 
Stone, editor, pp 232-233, Doubleday & Company, Garden City, 
COPYright 1970 by the Regents of the l'mverslty of Califorma I 

On a slightly more co mic .CQPC , ~rnold J Toynbee has 
speculated that adverSi ty rna) be the crucial catalyst which 
spawns superior CivilizatIOns B\ that theory, any struggle to 
prevail against challenge In on(' field generates an abundance 
of energy which uilimately lends Impl'lUs to new and grea ter 
achievement In other fields as 1'0" '11. 

ThiS IS the ratIOnale , then b\ which bad instruction , 
oversized c1as es, and pre_surp ,cook('1 academiC stress might 
all be Jusli lied The greater thl ordeal. the better we shall 
f10unsh Su preme challenges pi Cl' supreme achle,cOlents 
Incomprehensible or sopOrifiC I< tu res force students to think 
for thems~lves. Inacce 'S ible lIl'tl uctor~ oblige students to 
become elf-reliant. I The teachu of a 350-student class mav be 
InacceSSible lor all praclical purposes even though he po ts 
regularly scheduled of ic hour, Mtel computmg thell' 1/350th 
share of the prof's office time ronsclenttous students may 
figure they 're notentitled to both'llhe Instructor at all So, the 
grea ter thell' problem and the morl' help they need, the less 
i1ke ly such students are to let Ihelr plight be known . Certa lllly 
It takes uncommon gumplion tu JU~I drop In on su('h professors 
for a chat I I haven 't heard any ~ IOd ralionaliza tlOns for the 
ex tra lab sectons that no one pNS ony credit for But I suppose 
there's a general prinCiple Ihat every little bit of extra 
cr d It! s tOil is somehow good for th!' soul 

Inherent III those propoSit ions I a fallacy that Toynbel' 
him 'elf freely acknowledged wh,'re the adverSity IS too 
severe. It will deal a crushmg ulo\\ 10 all who attempt to meet 
it. 

Professor Koshland 1\Tltes Imprc-;s lvcly as the triumphant 
survivor of a ngorou academiC obstacle course What he 
neglects to pOint out IS that many 01 hiS companIOns fell by the 
waYSide, victims of a struggle Wit h which they could not cope 
In the same book where the Ko hl.rd e say appears , there are 
other artlcles by Glenn Sea borg dnd 'licholas Mayall which 
cite a 40% academiC mortality rate among their freshman 
classmates at Berkeley. Adversltl Il orks well where It wJrks 
at all But It doesn 't al~'a\' work : dnd no blanket endorsement 
of the sometllne virtue of adversltl can excuse us f rom the 
onerou burden of scrullnlzlng IfJ w-ndden programs and 
ineffective teachmg to determine thll r deleteriOUs effect" 

When I asked Dr. Yang whethel h, thought academic failure 
wa, perhaps carrying the ad~-er. Jl, ~ rlncipll' a bit too tar, he 
qUickly agreed that failure IS the \"ry d Ilnltlon of too much 

dl~clpllne and too much dlfliculty )I It had occurred to me to 
ask th question , I think he WOUl l .. Iso have agreed that the 
ad\.er<; lty pl'lnclple has backfired III: re Its effec t IS to turn (lfl 
stud nlS. to stifle CUriOSity, to alll'n:,te the Inqulnng mind To 
the ex tent that students ale unabll I shift for themselves , h 
dck nowledges the need for proportionately superior 
instruction 1 dlfler fro m Dr Yan~ Iln ly In hiS relalll'e neglect 
for the plight of otherWise able slIHh'nts who by nature , are 
devastatl'd rather than Invigoral<'d by ('u tthroat competi tion

SDPD replys to Sekula 
Editor : 

It seem only fa ir to comment on 
certain statements made by you which 
appeared recently in the Tnton Times 
under the headm~ " notes on a Speelfit 
Case of Police Harassment " 
Our po ilion must be made clear \\ e 

have a duty and a responsibility for thl' 
protectIOn of the cItizens of our City , 
whIch Includes CCSD students Part 01 
our city Includes our public lacilitles 
such as th Northern SectIOn Polic(' 
SubstatIOn We will pru"lde that 
secunt\' to the best of our ablilt\ 
Yes. '1r Sekula what you descflbe as 

a " manic turn ' m the ufflcer's 
questioning accompanied bl' <l 
·· paramilltary zeal" and blzarr 
threats" of police affected by " bizarre 
paranoia /blood lust" are merely young 
men concerned With vour well -being 
and our , ' 

It's true that these men feel the need 
to protect their families as they do 
yours If police seem paranoid about 
certa in thtngs, perhaps It IS because 
there IS usually some Justification fur 
the paranOia 
Last fall I attended the funeral of a 

San Franci co police sergeant who had 
"lost hiS virginity In a royal wa\',' as 
you describe it. espeCially 0 as he was 
gunned down while working a mght 
shift. which vou seem to feel has some

movement who fired through a hole

matter that the woman Insldl' was a 
Civilian She too was shot and severel}· 
wounded 
The decadent nature of thiS man 

killed while representln~ the 
" Establishment " was especlall~ 
obVIOUS as several busloads of boys 
from Hanna 's Bovs· Town la home for 
orphan boys) filed back onto tile buses 
after the sen ices for their long ride 
home It wa longer than usual thiS 
time because the ffl end who had .p nt 
each of hl ~ annual vacation, workmg 
with them would not be th r next 
summer As a member of the 
" embattled fraternity, " that s rgeant 
left a " weepmg widow ' and several 
chi ldren , "ad nauseam ," while " Iosmg 
his vlrgmlt}' In a royal way" Is It an' 
wonder that most police faclli tl snow 
have armed guards at all times of th(' 
day and night? 

You indicated that the officer.· 
refused to gl\'e vou a rece ipt for \,our 
film and that " With a lawyer 's help 
vou reeo\ ered the camera the next

contained the film and that the lawyer

1M Basketball over 
Pa'S'acy 

Unlike the NCAA champIOnship. the intramural basketball 
championship was Dot a foregone conclusion. although most 
everyone figuired that both the LA JOLLA STREET GANG 
and EBONY would make the finals. Well . most everyone was 
r ight - almost - as the STREET GANG. minus "Satch" 
Sanders. and EBONY. sa ns Gie Simpson. met shortly before 
the end of last quarter. In a closely-fought. well-refereed game 
the STREET GANG queaked out a 43-42 victory to cop the 
champIOnship. 

Bruiser Jim Green played perhaps his fmest game of the 
year . sconng 12 point and doing a job defen ively. holding 
Galloway to only two pomts. Lemon Grove had a fine second 
half. to wind up as high scorer With 13. Perhaps the biggest 
difference between the championship and the regular season 
game won by EBO Y was the neutralization of the blacks ' full 
court press. This was partially due to the game being played on 
the larger regulallon court . but largely because of Roger 
Gottfned 's ball-handl ing in the back court . along with Steve 
Meerson. 

Ebonv was down at halftime. but started the second ha lf 
qu icklv and pulled out to a lead. The STREET GANG wa 
forced to play catch-up. finally pulling ahead Wi th under two 
m inutes to go Gottfried blew the chance to give the GANG a 
two-point advantage by mlssmg a free thro\\ . The rebound 
came off to EBONY. who Immedlatelv called time out 
EBONY worked the ball to El i CurUs I who' had 12 pomts for the 
game I but big " E" was unable to hit hiS final hot and the LA 
J OLLA STREET GA G were champs.

"CCSD crew team 

aturda\ the L'CSD crew team travelE'd to LA Ilarbor to row 
against ttie esc TrOjans It was agreed that there would be 
four races The different classes were the freshman 4 the JV8 
and the lite weight 4 l'C D did not have enough big men to 
Ileid d Var ltv 8. so the Tntons lorfelted that e~ent 

At launch time the harbor was 10 less than Ideal condillon 
:\ot on I\' was there the usua I sltme and Oil but the shells were 
consistently taking on water I? I becau e of the h a\'y wakes 
The flrq race was announced as 'The heavyweight frosh 4" , 
every man In the esc shell had 20 pounds over hiS Tnton 
counterpart The frosh team of eCSD was beaten by 17 
seconds The esc freshmen have been rowing together since 
September. while the ['e. D experience ra nged from John 
Reynold ft"e months to David TurnqUISt's two weeks 

The J\'·8 wa. next to fall to the TrOjans The TrOjans 
deserved and did WIO 10 an excellent lime 01 6 25 for 2000 
meters 

The lite weight 4 was a different story. With l'CSD walkmg 
away With a victory fn all the races l"SC raced tllO boats 
against l'C D s one the TrOjan coach said "only one boat Will 
be the offiCial entry. the other Will be out there just for fun . In 
collegiate crev. there are no awards. only the shim from the 
lOSing boat Jay Bernard Geoff Ilaiton. Jac'k 1\ lanl. Dave 
Llscher and coxwam DaVid Johnson now can wear the crimson 
and j10ld of l'T I':ven though both the freshman and varsity 
team lI~re beaten bv the CCSD lite weights the) were told 
afterwards that the frosh were the offiCial shell It was not a 
show of respect to pit the Tntons. who had all made offiCial 
weight against a heavy varsity . who lost and then only 
offenng the victors the frosh shirts.

ready to play hall 
U's kind of hard to decide what to do Spring Quarter - I 

mean. should you hit the books hard and devote your time to 
incrf'asing your mental capabilities, or should you come out of 
winter 's hibernation , shake off the dust. get outside, and do 
it?!? With the lineup of activities that the Intramural 
Department has ava ilable, there 's really no choice - I mean, 
in Spring Quarter. books just take a back sea t, that 's all there 
is to it. 

Heading the list is softball , of course. Sprmgtime and softball 
are just about synonomous around UCSD. The competition is 
tough, as there are several fine ball clubs. but no matter what 
the score you can't help but dig it just being out there. Men 's 
softball is a low-pressure, yet highly skilled . game of slow-
pitch : Pitches mu;t be of moderate speed with a perceptible 
arch In order to ma ke it a " hitter 's game." But if you haven't 
tried it. don't be surprised if you have difficulty hitting these 
lob balls, as the better teams last yea r threw shutouts against 
some opponents. Organize your teams quickly : the capta in 's 
meeting is Thursday. March 30. at 5 p.m. 10 the PE cia sroom . 
Be there' 

Of all the sports. coed oftball i probably the best . if only for 
the relaxed , easy-going atmosphere under which it is played . 
Regular league games feature five-man . four-woman teams. 
Each team pitches to itself - but the catch is: guys get only 
two pitches, girls three. whether the pitch is outSide. mside. 10 
the dirt or over the backstop' l'>eedless to say. It behooves a 
team to have someone to la y It in nice and fat . There will also 
be a coed softball tournament to determine what team Will

elimination. separate from league games. and non-
manna tory .. Coed team captalOs ' meeting is also this 
Thursday. but an hour earlier at 4 p.m. 

Cold Water Polo 
So maybe your 're a little unusual and don 't like hitting a 

white spheroid with a stick , or maybe you're one of those who 
feels that human beings should have been born with gills rather 
than lungs, or maybe the idea of floating around in an 
oversized. inflated rubber doughnut just appeals to you ". I 
don 't know. Nevertheless. coed water polo teams are forming 
now. with the captains to meet for scheduling towards the 
latter part of next week. Games will be held Sunday nights, 
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. and. if enthusiasm is as 
grea t as hoped, Wednesday nights. More about this nexl week. 

The something-fo r-everyone- part of intramurals : men's 
soccer picks up from where it left off last quarter . Willie 
Young and his badminton "buddies" are battin ' around 
Thursday nights this quarter . There 's goi ng to be a lot of 
volleyball this spring - men 's and mixed doubles in the sand. 
maybe a four-women-to-a-team volleyball league (what about 
it. girls . any response?I, and . of course. a six person coed 
tournament to determme who's gomg to the AII-Cal. There are 
currently " challenge·' ladders in singles and doubles posted 
outside the handball courts with the possibility of similar 
ladders being organized in table tennis. Lee wants to get 
together some ort of intramural bicycle ralley or bike hike 
thi s quarter . If this thing sounds interestmg to you . talk to Lee 
so he can make some definite plans concerning It. Later in the 
quarter. the flying feet of UCSD get to show their fl eetness a t 
the intramural relays to be held on the athletic field . Included 
this year will be a run around the bases for time. 

This week softball 's getting organized: remember to have a 
team rep resentative at the meetmgs Thursday - coed at 4, 
men at 5 p.m. If you 've got any querie concerning intramurals 
call Lee Johnson at X2283
