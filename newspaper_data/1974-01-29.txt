Watson Discusses Third Enrollment 
by Roberta Rehm 

Third College experienced a 31 % drop In freshman 
enrollment this year . Total enrollm"nt, including ad-
vanced standing students went up 3"". During the Fall 
of 1972, however total enrollm nt increas d by 37%, 
with fre hman entrants up by 30% . 

Dr. Jo eph Watson , Third College Provost, explained 
the dra tic drops in a recent interview, " I think it's 
probably a one .year happening in the following sen e: 
the fall of 73 represents the first time that we would see 
the rotal impact of the activities which the college went 
through in the Spring of 1972. That is, we had some 
controversy in the college and it would not have shown 
up in the Fall of 1972 simply because, by that time, 
students were already committed (to coming to UCSD.) 
"There was a 'major controversy in the college over 

administrative structuring and the degree and form in 
which student-faculty participation would occur," 
Watson added . The controversy developed when a 
number of students and faculty members at Third felt 
that they did not have an adequate voice in making 
decisions involving the college. A petition was cir-
culated, at the time, urging the dismissal of Provost 
Watson . 

According to Watson , the situation will not have 
lasting effects on Third College enrollment. "Our 
enrollment has continuously increased and I think the 
worst year for enrollment would have been this year 
because that's the year that a sort of public controversy 
would have had its major impact . I think that's more 
than fading away. From both the registrars office and 
the Office of Relations with Schools and from William 
Byrd, Director of EOP, all reports are that Third College 
is attractive to students and they expect us to more than 
meet the total anticipated or expected enrollment goals 
for next year. 

" I don' t think there is going to be any drop off In 
enrollment. I think we' re going to begin to grow quite 
rapidly," he concluded . 

Dr. Joyce Justus, Urban and Rural Studies , com-
mented, "It (enrollment) isn't really dropping off in the 
absolute sense. We don't have a lower enrollment now 
than we had last year ." 

Watson 1:!xpects that enrollment for next year will

begin to grow once again There are approximately 350 
freshman applications pending now and 130 advanced 
standing appli cants 0 more freshman applica tions 
will be taken but Watson expect advan ced standing 
applicant to more than double befor the opening of 
school In the Fall He stated that all those who qualify 
will be accept d for the Fall quarter 

Provost Wat on expects at least 70% of Th ird's 
tudents to return next year He added, "That's com-

Good and Bad News 
for University Hospital 

In response to community need for additional parking 
at University Hospital, a nE'w 700-~pace parking 
structure will be opened Feb. 4 . 

Completion of the facility for use by hospital and 
other UCSD personnel means the more convenient main 
parking lot directly across from the hospital on 

. Dickinson Street will become available for public use. It 
also marks the end of sometimes frantic half-hour 
searches by visitors for a parking spot, and clogged curb 
parking in the surrounding Hillcrest area. 

Since state law requires that parking on University of 
California and state college campuses be paid by 
student and employee users, hospital personnel wi II 
repay cost of the new $1,688,000 structure through 
parking fees

Del Chiaro to Speak 
on Tuscany Dig 

Mario Del Chiaro. professor of art history and head of 
the UC Santa Barbara Archeological Team digging in 
Tuscany, will speak at UCSD, Friday February 1st, 4 P.M . 
in the auditorium of the Humanities and Social Science 
Building 2D-2250. Del Chiaro will show slides of the 
team's discoveries within an inhabited 6'/1 acre site of a 
yet unidentified Etruscan town in Tuscany containing 
paved streets, drainage system, and dwellings with open 
courts. 

Most spectacu lar of the finds has been the discovery 
of a votive deposit comprised of bronze statuettes and 
terracotta scu lpture which, on the evidence of their 
type - male and female heads, models of human 
anatomy of internal and external character, animal 
figures, etc . - strongly suggests the presence of a 
healing or fertility cult whose temple originally stood 
somewhere nearby. 

Other items unearthed in individual rooms include 
bronze pins, handles and jewelry, terracotta loom-
weights, and pottery. 

Corporal Punishment 
Legislation to ban the use (If corporal punishment 

against handicapped chi ldren enrolled in special 
education classes was introduced last week by State 
Senator Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland), Students 
covered by this proposed law include the handicapped, 
blind . mentally retarded, crippled, deaf. emotionally 
disturbed and psychotic . 

The East Bay legislator stated that he became aware 
of the problem when a Fremont, California, constituent 
complained that her mentally retarded child came 
home from school with the imprint of a full handprint 
on her upper leg, The mark lasted four days on the nine-
and-a-half-year-old child's skin . 

Under California law, corpora l punishment is legal 
provided school districts establish guidelines for its use. 
Some major school districts, including Oakland and San 
FranciSCO, have banned its use entirely. but its use is still 
widespread . The State Department of Education is 
expected to issue a full report on corporal punishment 
in Februarf . 

" It is in< onceivable to me why any teacher fee ls the 
need to p .. ddle or swat or spank a child who is han-
dicapped or mentally retarded . Certainly, no 
profession II educator would condone such behavior no 
matter hON difficult the chi ld might be to contro l,"

In tead UCSD chose 10 
abandon this traditional 
form of representation and 
devise a new structure. It is 
called T.U.S.C. and it stand 
for The Undergraduate 
Student Counc il. 

It is a new concept in 
universitie today that is 
designed 10 better serve 
student needs directly. Its 
goals are to 1) be an ar-
ticulate voice for students, 
2) be sens itive . to ad-
ministration policies and 
their possib le eHect on 
student life, 3) be a cen-
tralized group of resources 
to aid students. 

These ambitious goa ls 
were recently outlined in an

person of T .U .S.C. , 
StephaniE' Harris . Harri s 
"avE' a historical per-

of T.USC. and its future

T.USC. was the creation 
of a tudent committee last 
year, appointed by the 
chancellor, to devise a new 
"student government" at 
UCSD. This committee, the 
tudent Life and Interest 

Committee (S .L.I.c.) was 
created a fler the student 
body had voted in the 
Spring of 1971 to abolish 
the old Associated Student 
government . 

T.U.S.C. is composed of 3 
students selected from each 
college and one student 
from each of the minority 
groups on campus. 

T.USC. is an attempt to 
serve the students without 
ruling them. As Harris said, 
"T.U.S.C. is not a student 

government because it workings of 
doesn't govern anyone." It ministration and

This year T.U .S.C. spent 
about 5100,000 on student

campus media to the bridge 
club . 56,00 per year of the 
5212 regis tration fee payed 
by each student goes to 
T.USC. to pay for these' 
programs. 

T . U . S. C . appoints 
students to all the 
university-wide committees

The third role of T.U .S.C. 
is the least defined, but 
perhaps the most im-

sporadic when dealing with

A broken water main flooded the new gym with more

Shortly before noon Friday, a grading tractor from 

Omega Landscape Co . ran over a water main about 
twelve feet away from the door of the new gym causi ng 
a 30 foot geyser to erupt. 

The geyser quickly flooded the entran ce to the gym 
door. At one time the water line was one foot from the 
top of the door. Water then seeped under the door and 
through the cracks and proceeded to fi ll the gym with 
about three feet of water 

The gym was so fu ll of water that all the draifsqwere

1nnis AUiicle Is 
An Abortion 

by Hieronymous Hoover 
A crowd of hundreds marched through downtown 

Poway Tuesday prote ting the operation of Cluck-Off 
Chicken Works, a major industry in that city . 

The demonstrators demanded an end to the daily 
slaughter of hundreds of chickens that occu rs at Cluck-
Off, and ca lled for a boycott of Kentucky Colonel , 
Chicken Delight, Chick-A-Dee, and other chains which 
sell Cluck-Off products . Demonstrators carried signs 
reading: "G ive Chicks A Chance," "Murder is Murder," 
and "God Loves Chickens." The march cu lminated in 
the ritual burial of a Bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken 
on the lawn in front of the Cluck-Off Plant. 

Frank Bilius. owner-manager of Cluck-Off, explained 
hi position to reporters "We feel that i t is our right to 
do with our own property as our conscience dictates, 
and we won't let any kook pressure group deprive us of 
that right."

Letters To The Editor

Destroyed 
Editor : 

It is our strong opinion 
that thi University is 
systematically destroying 
everything that makes It 
unique. As we were walking 
to Matthews Campus the 
other day, we were shocked 
to find that the mural on 
the old water tank had been 
covered over with a drab 
coat of beige paint . We 
really don't care if it's going 
to be an office; that mural 
wa part of student ex-
pression on this campus 
( om thing that is 
becoming quite rare). The 
paint wa in fairly good 
condi tion (the cement tank 
doesn't need the protection 
of paint , anyway). and if the 
Univer ity obje ted to the 
graffiti on th tank . it cou ld 
have easily been removed 
or ' painted over without 
destroying the entire work . 
The buildings and offices 
on this campu generally all 
look alike; that mural made 
thi struct ure unique , 
original. and 10 most 
people. aesthetically ap-

pealing. 
Wh i Ie we' re on the 

ubject of aesthetics, there 
is anpther commodity this 
University possesses that is 
unique in this too-modern 
world - greenery. Much to 
our dismay, thiS is rapidly 
disappearing, being 
replaced by walkways that 
greatly resemble Los 
Angele freeways . Take a 
walk between Urey Hall and 
the "new" gym - isn' t it 
beautiful 1 As you approach 
the gym . you will encounter 
a huge conglomeration of

general, a mass confusion

on for a long time with no 
detrimental effects ; the 
new gym does not increase 
traffic enough to have

Starts "'Ring" Cycle 

Shawn Phillips, appearing at the Sports Arena with the 
Moody Blues, February 1 at 8'00 P.M . 

The eyes nf the entire 
opera world Clre again on 
the San Diego Opera--this 
time for its new and lavish 
mounting of Wagner 's 
"Ring" cycle, beginning 
with "The RlJine Gold," 
February 6, 8 and 10 at the 
Civic Theatre. The balance 
of the "Ring"--"Die 
Wilillure," "Siegfried" and 
"Gotterdiimmerung," will 
be presented one per 
season through 1977. 

Th opera is carried to 
majestic heights . by the 
lush, rOmantic music 
associated with Wagner and 
the "Ring" under the baton 
of Maestro Walter Herbert, 
General Dir ctor and 
Conductor of the San Diego 
Opera Thi production of 
"The Rhine Gold" is 
conceived and directed by 
George London , Executive 
Director of the National 

Abstract Pointing Exhibition 
There will be an 

exhibition of paintings in 
the UCSD Art Gallery until 
February 15. Tom Holland, 
Edward Moses and Richard 
Yokomi are three of the 
most important abstract 
painters on the West Coast 
today. Each questions the 
literal structure of painting 
and provides alternatives . 

Tom Holland works on a 
plastic ground which has 
some added shapes riveted 
to the picture place; other 
similar shapes are " painted 
on" providing a play or 
dialogue between similar 
but different forms . 

Edward Moses 
works on canvas, 
conventional painting 
surface, but presents it " off 
the stretcher," immersed in 
plastic and more fully 
integrated into the drawing 
and color of the painting. 
He also paints 
paper grounds

Richard Yokomi also

The production is

The cast of Teutonic gods

The convoluted plot

Three Rhine-maidens are

This production of "The

The Battle for Dominance 
Since man's beginning on 

earth the interplay between 
dominant and submissive 
individuals has been one of 
the basic blocks upon 
which our social and family 
structures are bui It. Some 
humans dominate; others 
are dominated; and from 
this chain of command and 
control has evolved our 
political systems, our ideas 
of property and ownership, 
the . relationship between 
the sexes .. . even our 
sporting events . 

"The Bilttle for 
Dominilnce" is the subject -
and the title - of the second 
"Primal Miln" specia l from 
The Travelers Theatre of 
Man , airi~g Thursday, 
January 31, 9-10 PM (El) on 
the ABC Television Net-
work . The hour traces the 
history of dominan e and 
submi ss ion , from

Has human dominance 
rem ained unchanged 
throughout man 's history? 
According to Dr . Philip 
Zimbard o, who e 
Simulated -prison ex-
periment at Stanford 
University is featured in 
"The Battle for 
Dominilnce," the answer is 
no . 

December 29 in Detroit. Group founder, 
guitarist Mahavishnu John McLaughlin 
said the split resulted from the "different 
spiritual paths" being followed by the 
Orchestra's members. His future plans 
include the possibility of forming a larger 
group, possibly including violinist Jean-
Luc Panty. It's expected that drummer 
Billy Cobham will form his own band and 
violinist Jerry Goodman and keyboardist 
Jan Hammer will probably form a group 
together. The future plans of bassist Rick 
Laird were not known at press time. 

Skip Batten, an original Byrd, has 
joined the "New Riders," replacing 
bassist Dave Torbert. 

Steel guitarist Bobby Black has left 
Commander Cody. He's b en replaced by 
Jimmy Day. 

We t coast favorites, the " Sons of 
( hamplin," are without a label after 
being dropped by Columbia. 

New 'releases coming in February from 
Boz Scaggs, "Earth Wrnd and Fire," Cab 
Calloway and Tanya Tucker on 
Columbia; Brewer & Shipley on Capitol ; 
Maggie Bell's debut, Black Heat, the 
"Spinners" and Melvin Van Peebles on 
Atlantic ; J.J. Cale, the "Gap Band" and 
Phoebe Snow on Shelter; Ballin' Jack 
"Live" alld the Butts Band from Mercury, 
and in March, expect new LP's from 
"Chicago" (VII), Loggins & Messina, 
Johnny Winter , Grand Funk and possibly, 
Paul Simon. 

" During the tim e of 
primal man," Dr. Zimbardo 
says, " dominance was 
primarily a matter of 
physical strength ; the 
strongest individual im-
posed his will on others 
who came withiri his reach, 
his sphere of influence. 
Modern man, however, 
dominates primarily by use 
of symbols uniforms, 
emblems, words . This 
allows one man to control 
many more people than 
ever cou Id have been 
dominated by physical 
force alone . The dominant 
person doesn't even have to 
be pre nt, his symbol - a 
uniform worn by a 
subordinate, a flag, anyone 
of a number of things - i 
<ufficient. 

Ie 

" In fact , I think the most 
dramatic difference bet-
ween primal man and 
modern man is the extent to 
which modern man is able 
to control people by 
symbols ." 

The validity of this 
hypotheSis was proved 
dramatically by Dr. Zim-
bardo's simulated-prison 
experiment, in which he 
recruited 24 stable, in-

students and randomly 
divided them into 
" prisoners" and " guards ." 
The guards were outfitted in 
khaki uniforms, with 
mirrored sunglasses, and 
they carried night -sticks 
borrowed from the Palo 
Alto police. The prisoners 
wore shapeless cotton 
smocks with large numbers 
on them, chains on their 
ankles, and nylon stocking-
masks 'lVer their hair to 
minimize the individual 
differences among them . 
Dr. Zimbardo made no rules 
for ei ther prisoners or 
guards; he simply set them 
up as a functioning "prison " 
in an area specially 

.. 

designed fpr the purpose, 
and let them create their 
own relationships 

The results were 
staggering The experiment, 
which had been projected 
to run two weeks, had to be 
called off after only six days 
because of the increasing 
brutality of the guards and 

. the incredible su b-
missiveness of the 
prisoners . Five of the 
" imprisoned" students had 
to be released because of 
temporary breakdowns 
uncontrollable crying or 
other abnormal behaVior -
before the six days were up. 
(A ll participants have been 
followed up on for the two 
years si nce the experiments 

took place, and there were 
no lasting ill -effpcts ) 

"When the experiment 
was over, the single phrase 
used most by the students 
who had been guards was, 'I 
can't believe it was me. I've 
never acted Irke that in my 
life: " Dr. Zimbardo says 

" The experiment 
demonstrates a great many 
things about human 
behavior but one of the 
most Interesting is the 
extent to which a symbol -
in this case, a uniform - can 
alter personalities . This IS 
an exclusively modern form 
of dominance "

Spikers Gain Semis 
In YMCA Tourney 

The UCSD Volleyball 
Team made up, at least 
partially, for their bad start 
last week with a fourth in 
the AII-Cal Tournament, as 
they reached the semi-finals 
of the Hollywood YMCA 
USVBA Tournament. 

Although placed in the 
"Lower 'Am division, also 
probably because of their 
past performan ces , the 
Tritons showed their colors 
as they came 10 first in their 
pool, wh ich included such 
powerhou ses as Loyola 
University, and University 
High's second team. 

There were, as usual, 
several tense moments, as 
the Tritons started with a 
split with Loyola . In the 
second games, the squad 
got things together and 
rolled over their opponents. 

Everybody got to play in 
the last match With a team 
comprised of beach players 
from M anhattan Beach, as 
the Tritons breezed to their 
playoff berth 1.1-2 11-3. 

With this win, the UCSD 
team f inished with a seven 
Win, one loss record in 
round robin play, wh ich 
was matched by Loyola, but 
the Tritons went to the 
playoffs because of their 
better points scored vs. 
points allowed record 

In the playoff s, the 
Tritons were ranked second, 
which managed to get them 
a match with USC's second, 
who were seeded third. In 
the ensuing game, both 
teams were awesome, but 
the good guys 1051 a close 
one 15-10. 

It must be said that 
passing and hitt n. were 
much more consi staht than 
at the AII-Cal, but the 

VALUE-VILlAGE 

blocking needed some 
work. Standouts for the 
Tritons were hitters Steve 
Simpson, Bruce Cazden and 
Tim Myrick, and especially 
Mike McMahan , who 
started in place of the 
missing Randy Nooteboom. 

As usual, the Baldwin 
brothers act was spec-
tacular, both the sets and 
their vocal contributions .

Cold Day Cools 
Down Ruggers 

by Johnno Staighl 

What a surprisingly 
satisfying day of rugby 
Saturday was ! The Tritons 
lost the first team game, 
and the weather was cold 
and wet. But my oh my, 
what a good time was had 
by all ! 

This year over 75 ruggers 
turned out for the 
organizational meeting in 
November . The head 
honchos, Rugger Dugger 
and Von Jezeraine, were 
slightly overwhelmed by 
such an unexpectedly 
enthusiastic response. 

Problems arose with the 
management of such a large 
number of eager glory-
bound ruggers . This week-
end marked a de facto 
return to the fine UCSD 
rugby philosophy of 
"everybody plays ." 

Despite the cold a good 
crowd showed up for the 
matches. 

Three games were played 
against the Cal State Long 
Beach, Forty-Niner Rugby 
Club. The third and second 
teams of UCSD and Long 
Beach played a pair of 
vi gorous and enjoyable 
games 

I n both matches rookie 
ruggers Ed Gonzales and 
Roy Rogers (who jOined th e 
club only two days ago) 
played along with seasoned 
veterans like the lithe-
limbed Serti c and John 
Huber. 

Much valuable ex -
perience was gained by the 
UCSD ruggers and exciting 
times were shared by new 
players. UCSD won both 
games , by scores of 16-4, 
and 22-4 . 

In the big game of the 
day, the Tritons were put 
down by a stron g Forty-
Niner first team , that 
howed an excellent tyle of 

rugby. Their game plan was 
marked by a fine display of 
kicking and a backfield that 
was experienced and in 
good physical condition . 
Particularly impressivp was 
'The Mole', inside-center for 
Long Beach, who baffled 

the Tritons wit h an 
awesome array of fakes , 
and fine passes. 

UCSD's only score of the 
game came on a penalty 
kick, in the fi rst half. It was 
a hard-fought contest, but 
the rortY-Niners clearl y 
dominated the game with 
their superior experience 
and knowledge of rugby. 
rinal score 28-3. 

In the party that 
followed, CSU Long Beach 
started trongly with a 
vigorous show of numbers 
and rousing songs , but the 
Tritons came back as 
stragglers showed up,' and 
th hard-core ruggers called 
up a great variety of 
outrageous lies and rowdy 
tunes. 

Next Saturday the Tritons 
travel to Loyola for a pair of 
I ague matche and on · 
Sunday host the Arizona 
Touring Club here at 2 p.m.

Letters 
continued from p"le 3 

campus are the result of 
apparent poor planning. 
There is nowhere that this 
poor planning is more 
apparent than in the mass 
over-<:rowding that is being 
experienced this year. (They 
want twelve co lleges?) Even 
though increased 
enrollment was expected, 
no one was prepared to 
handle It. Packed 
classrooms, three people 
jammed into a double dorm 
room, and huge lines are all 
direct res:Jlts of this . Once 
again. look at the walkways . 
Although neither of us 
claims to be an engineer, a 
contractor, or a designer, it 
seems to us that the walk-
ways were deSigned by a 
complete moron. (Look at 
the new cement addition by 
the pool) . 

We wrote this letter 
because we are seriously 
concerned about the ap-
pearance and future bf this 
college. As student power 
increases, we would like to 
see students having more 
influence on the planning 
of our school, both in 
regards to future expansion 
and construction . As you 
have probably already 
noticed, what burns us up 
the most are the new walk-
ways . I f you are as 
nauseated as we are when 
you see grass needlessly 
replaced by asphalt, please 
how the University your 

feelings in the same manner 
that we have been using : 
don't walk on any of the 
new walkways (the old ones 
are all right) . It's too late to 
save our mural, but let's not 
allow anything e lse of 
special value to meet the 
ame fate . We like U.C.S.D. 

because it's a good school , 
and, most of all, it's unique. 
We don't want it to become 
just another u.c. 

Sincerely, 

Gregory Cutter

Stuff 
Editor : 

According to the 
physicist, Prof. Halpern, 
"the whole universe is filled 
with stuff; " however, the 
chemist, Prof. Linck says, 
we have "a beaker full of

believe that it is about time 
that the Nat. Sci. Dept. gets 
its 'stuff' together .

Input Needed 
Editor . 

We were dismayed to 
learn of the painting-over of 
the mural on the old round 
bunker between R{:velle 
and Third Colleges. We 
believe that there are many 
others I ike ourselves who 
considered the mural a 
unique and refreshing sight 
on a campus otherwise 
dominated by blank 
concrete walls . Apparently, 
there was no effective 
publicity about the decis ion 
and no responsible student 
input to the Campus 
Planning Committee that 
ultimately made the 
decision to paint over the 
mural . We think that efforts 
should be made to com-
mission another mural on 
the bunker and to establish 
responsible student input to 
the Campus Planning 
Committee. We are sure 
that our willingness to help 
in the attainment of these 
objectives will be shared by 
many other members of the 
UCSD community who are 
concerned about the 
development of an in-
teresting and colorful 
environment.

Flood 
continued from pilRe 2 

turned otf. 
The fire department was 

called to the scene with an 
engine and truck com-
panies but was unable to 
use the pump on the engine 
company because the truck 
was unable to get close 
enough to the gymnasium . 
The fire department did 
however use three portable 
pumps but the 
unavailability of the engine 
pump made the process 
tedious and increased the 
chances of fire and water 
damage. 

There wlls immediate 
concern about the damage 
the gym may have 
sustained . The vinyl 
covering the walls was chief 
of concerns. J.O . Mills of 
the Physical Plant said, " the 
gym floors were in no 
danger of damage." He 
continued by saying that 
"the floor has been flooded 
before during the recent 
rains and there has been no 
damage." 

Although the operator of 
the tractor was nnt reached 

Brown's Candidacy 
Continued from Pille 1 

agencies whose conflicting jurisdiction has resulted 
in little or no action. 

When asked about offshore oil drillinll, Brown 
said, "I oppose it". He continues by saying he op-
poses oil taken from state owned wells being sold to 
oil companies at a reduced rate and then sold to the 
consumer at a higher price. According to Brown , this 
has resulted in the shortage of heating oil in some 
cities like Los Angeles and Burbank because of the 
excessive high price. He believes the oil of the state 
should be used to supply the energy demands of the 
people. 

Brown as Secretary of State has been Jesponsible 
for many political reforms, he said, "as Governor I 
will continue to fight for meaningful reform of our 
political system." 

His economic proposals include il.lproving the job 
placement record of the Human Resources 
Department which has decreased the number of job 
placements from 1966 to 1973. 

Brown announced his candidacy in a series of 
press conferences which began at the Harbor Island 
Travellodge 9:00 yesterday morning and continued 
through the day with stops in Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, and Sacramento . 

Woman's Union 
Continued from Pille 1 

on campus. 
The Women's Union has arranged to bring Dr. Estelle 

Ramey, President of American Women in Science and a 
faculty member of Johns Hopkins Medical School. She 
has done extensive research in endocrinology. She will 
speak on the biological basis of sex differences . 

June Jackson Christmas is a black psychiatrist who 
will speak on sexism and racism . She is the director of a 
major mental health department in New York City . 

Karen Paige is a psychologist who is currently doing 
research at Davis on menstrual stress . Her topic will be 
the influence of cultural learning versus the biological 
basis of feminine problems. A panel discussion on 
sexuality, a women's art show, and a feminist film series 
are also tentatively planned for the month of April 

The Women's Center in the Fish Bowl needs furniture, 
books and magazines for a small lending library, and 
People. 

for comment there ap-
parently is a difference of 
opinion as to whose fault it 
was. Gene Woods , in 
charge of the landscaping 
project for Omega Land-
scape, said " I want to know 
why the pipe was at ground 
level." ;,oward Rommell 
from the university's Ar-
chitectural and Engineering 
Department said, "the 
landscaping company had 
the plans of all the piping in 
the vicinity and should 
have known thilt the pipe 

Food Co-op 
determined . Under con-
sideration is a one dollar fee 
for all people wishing to 
shop at the co-op and enjoy 
buying foods at wholesale 
prices. The fee monies 
would then be put towards 
operational costs and 
expansion i.e., adding more 
products to the shelves . 

Anyone wanting to 
simply voice their 
suggestions as far as what 
they would like to see sold 
at the ccrop are welcomed 

was there ." 

The crew of the land-
scaping company were kept 
busy this past weekend 
cleaning up the mud where 
in some places was a foot 
deep . Triton Times Editor-
in-Ch ief, Dave Buchbinder, 
a casual observer, was 
prompted to remark about 
the mud that su rrounded 
the new gym, "now I know 
how the Germans felt 
wading through the mud 
before Moscow in 1941 ." 

continued from pille 2 

to the Thursday night 
meeting . We will have to 
work within the reality of 
our space limitations, but 
such are limitat ions, which, 
if pressed by student 
demands and interest, can 
be broadened. 

Students unable to attend 
the Thursday meeting who 
would like to work on the 
co-op organization are 
asked to contact the Triton 
Tim s, and leave in-
formation as to where they 
can be reached . 

Third Enrollment 
Continued from Pille 1 

the process of no longer getting lower divi~ion courses 
in order We're trying to expand on and develop upper 
division programs. In some areas we're beginning to get 
the spill-over of these lower division or undergraduate 
courses into the graduate program . With the coming of 
the new buildings in 1975 we' ll now have the facilities to 
compliment the academic program." 

Dr. Justus commented, "I think students are stili 
excited (about Third College) but I think it interesting 
how the excitement has changed . It really takes a very 
different kmd of a form now. I think people are more 
concerned speCifically about the academic programs, 
about how we prepare them for the world of work , 
about their existence in Third College and what they're 
going to do in the outside world " . . 

"The Initial enthusiasm was much In terms of gOing 
off to a new frontier; in terms of establishing. Now we're 
established . It comes down to the less glamorous, more 
fundamental effort of getting a good education," 
Watson added. 

Summing up the feeling at Third College now, Dr 
Justus added, 'What I see happening at Third College IS 
similar to what I see happening to students around the 
campus as a whole ."
