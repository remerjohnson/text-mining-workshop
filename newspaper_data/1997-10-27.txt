the meaning 01 the law has

Wi I,on. the ~tatute, are a way to 
"force men to he morally and

teenage partners and the bahies 
they father." 

ACl:Ording to a national ~urvey, 
over RS percent of ,tatutory rape 

charge~ arc not again~t men who 

have acquired over a longer peri-
od of time. We have to figure out 
what we are going to do for the 
rest of our college careers within 
the first quarter. Some of us are 
not ready for that. We are not 
given a grace period to familiar-
ize ourselves with the campus 
and the way it works. 

To top it all off, it is incredi-
bly hard to meet people. UCSD 
students are not as friendly as I 
thought they would be. Maybe 
they have their own problems to 
deal with and have been here too 
long to want to make new 
friends. Whatever the case may 
be, transferees are thrown into 
classes where we do not know 
anybody. 

It i~ difficult to meet people 
who have already established 
their own circle of friends and do 
not feel the de~ire or the necessi -
ty to make new one~ .

do not like. Education seems 10

much you learn, but about how 
much money you bring in. 

I have eavesdropped on stu-

I have heard more than one of my 
TAs and professors harping on 
the fact that they havc too many 
students . If we are not gelling 
our money 's wonh and the pro-
fessors cannot teach effectively, 
then something has to change.

their concerns from the quantity

THEORY: Roemer dis-

By Annam Manthlram 
Guardian Reporter 

UC Davb economic~ Profe~~or 
John Roemerexplaincd how his the-
ory of "Equality of Opponunity" 
could he applied to education at a 
lecture la~t Friday afternoon. 

Roemer ,aid in education, every 
student i~ not given the equal 
opportunity to succeed because the 
"playing field" - the level at 
which individuals compete against 
other individuals - i~ not level. 

According to Roemer, things 
need to happen before there can be 
equal opportunity for all. 

"Society ~hould do what it can 
to level the playing field among 
individuals who compete for posi-
tions so that all those with the rele-
vant potential eventually wi II be 
admissible poob of ca ndidate~ 
competing for the positions." 

The ~econd element of 
Roemer's hypothesis, the Equal 
Opportunity Principle, applies to 
the joh market. 

Romer said he believes that those 
individuals who possess the attribut-
es relevant to the perfonnance of a 
positron's duties should be hired 
solely because of those attributes. 
Roemer added that "race or sex 
should not count for or against a per-
son's eligibility for a position" if 
those qualities are irrelevant.

applied to education, in order for

in the workplace after graduation. 

dents into type~ , where groups arc 
defined by individuals who have 
the same differential circum-
stances, and the same ability or 
effort to transform resource~ into 
educational achievements. 

The playing field is not equal. he 
said , due to "mounds and troughs" 
which he defined as "differential The Equal Opportunity 
circumstance,," or 
circum,tances 
heyond the stu-
dents' control. 
These can include 
race, IQ or rarental 
income. 

In order to level 
these rnound~ and 
troughs, Roemer 
believes that more 
educational 

resource~ need to be 
provided to those 
students with differ-
ential circum-
stances that hinder 
their ability to learn. 

However, he 
said that "guaran-
teei ng equal per 
capita financing of 
education is not 
suflicient to pro-
vide equal educa-
tional achievement 

"Guaranteeing

Roemer said that

tional achievemcnl~ 
of all types, but not 
to equalize achieve-

which differ

individual's enon~. 

"Thus, equality

since different children are able to 
use educational resources with dif-
ferent degrees of effectiveness." 

He also said that 
the degree to which an equal-oppor-
tunity policy would be implemented 
depends on society's willingness to 
provide resources to disadvantaged 
types, and consumers' willingness 
to saeritice some values like the 
quality of goods produced, after 
equalizing opponunities. 

According to Roemer, students 
are often prisoners to circumstances 
beyond their control and should not 
be penalized for poor perfonnance.

BOOKS: Project 
will be available on 
the Internet 
ContInued ".. ..... 1 

According 10 Lowell, the 
alliance's first major project will 
be to digitize documents related to 
the exploration of the Pacific, such 
as maps, drawings, explorers' 
diaries and other primary source 
materials. The goal is to merge 
these digitized works into a unified 
database accessible via the World 
Wide Web. 

Currently, Ihis projcct is in the 
planning 3tages with data being 
gathered in order to deternline the 
funding requirements for such an 
endeavor. Lowell estimates the 
project, which was first proposed 
last June, may take two to three 
years 10 complete. 

In addition, several specific pro-
jects are already planned for the 
alliance, including the development 
of multilingual, online library cata-
logs, document delivery of journal 
anicles via Ihe Internet, and remole 
access to local databases. These 
projects will be going on lL~ Ihe 
alliance builds. 

The concept of Ihe alliance

to online information in Chinese, 
Japanese and Korean scripts. 

As pari of this project, UCSD 
held a seminar of technical library 
specialists, out of which UCSD 
launched several bi lateral agree-
ments for the exchange of scholar-
ly information. 

"The success of and the value 
placed on these initial bilateral 
exchanges inspired the concept of 
creating a multilateral pannership 
to include libraries representing 
major academic institutions 
throughoul the Pacific Rim 
region," Lo said. 

Lowell, who played a central 
role in the creation of the alliance, 
was also hopeful Ihat the success 
of the bilateral agreements would 
carry over to Ihis latest alliance. 

"The alliance is intended as an 
umbrella support structure 10 fos-
ter a wide variely of specific pro-
jects," Lowell said. "Projects 
which previously would have been 
undenaken Ihrough bilateral con-
ncctions could now be conducted 
under the broader scope of the new 
multilaleral connection."

Alpern ~aid such a project had

"We had to introduce it to the

Dynl:s ' support of the project 
was a boon to Alpern, A.S. planners 
and the Alumni Association. 

"The money came out of hi s dis-
cretionary funding, " Alpern said. 

Alpern added that Dynes' action 
helped spiur the project along. In 
audit ion. the A.S. planners' jobs 
were simplified as they no longer 
had to search for a source of fund s.

change UC polici es, reshapl: an 
entire student body's att itude. or even 
increase participation in thl: pl:p

So, whcn I wa., askcd to write this 
edition's soapbox, naturally. I was 
abo asked what my topic would be. 
Frankly. I'm tired of topics. Ca ll me 
a cynic, but I would mther read some 
entertaining stuff. 

So, as usual, I am just going to 
write about me being loaded. What 
else would I write about'? I was told 
to make this column 'funny '. I can't 
handle that kind of pressure sober, 
hence the story of my own personal 
Sun God Festival - which just hap-
pens to be every Friday. 

That's right. Guess who doesn't 
have classes on Wednesday and 
Friday'! The damn Coach! 

This way, although I suffer 
through Tucsdays and Thursdays, my 
weekend begins at 2:05 Thursday 
afternoon. So what do I do on 
Fridays'! I sleep unti I noonish. then I 
come to school, put my alcohol na-

drinking my Jack and Coke, screw-
driver. or whatever, and make all 
sons of neat friends whom I will 
never remember. 

The best pan about Fridays this 
quarter has been the fact that the 
good peoplc at our athletic depart-
ment have scheduled a great many 
sporting events on Friday afternoons 
and evenings. There IS always a soc-
cer game or two, maybe some water 
polo, or a lillie women 's volleyball. 
Whatevcr it is, I'm always happy. 
This way, thcre is always a gathering 
of my kind of peoplc somcwhere on 
campus. 

Baskally. I'm on campus from 
around 2ish to about 9ish on Fridays. 
hut it 's usually all a blur. The point is. 
I'm having one hell of a lime (t his is

Brown said. '"I'hat's bow the program began. At this

The Honors Achievement program is an offshoot of 
a similar program at UC Berkeley, the development of 
which Brown oversaw. 

"The Honors Achievement workshop has the same 
group of students meet twice a week. as an organized 
facilitated study group, so that students who are taking 
the same class can meet together," Brown said. "It is

Don't get me wrong - I've seen 
my fair share of pits and I know thc

accidenlal elbow to the eye - Ihat

I got hurt, 100. A couple of guys 
fell on my ankle and twisted il in a 
really nasty way. BUI hey, I really 
didn'l feel il - 10 be honest. I jusl 
couldn'l walk 100 well anymore -
no worries, that 's cool. 

When we showed up at the 
crowded Price Cenler. I was happy to 
find thaI much of lhe crowd was evi-
dently dropped oIl' by mommy and 
were just beginning 10 grow hair in

Back to the Jungle 
EAP's Costa Rica program gives biology an exotic twist 

By Marc Comer 
Guardian Reporter 

Thc Tropical Biology in Costa 
Rica program is an Education 
Abroad Program (EAP) that offers 
studcnts the opportunity to study 
abroad in a unique environment. 

In this program, students do not 
attend a major university; rather, 
thcy spend a quarter in the rain 
forests of Costa Rica. 

Students have the choice to 
study in Monteverde, located in 
Northern Costa Rica, or Las 
Cruces, in Southern Costa Rica. 
The Monteverde program is offered 
in the spring and fall, and the Las 
Cruces program is offered only in 
the spring. While each program has 
individual objectives, both focus on 
understanding and experiencing the 
biology of Cosla Rica's rain 
forests. 

The Monteverde and Las Cruces 
~ites both give students the oppor-
tunity to study at biological field 
stations. At the Monteverde site 
students stay at the Monteverde 
Biological Station located next to 
the Monteverde Cloud Forest 
Reserve. Students studying in Las 
Cruce~ stay at the Las Cruces 
Biological Station, an internation-
ally known research center. 

Along with students from all of 
the othcr UC campuse~, UCSD stu-
dents live In dorm·like facilities. 

Amy Boone, a student who 
studied at Las Cruces, said the 
facilities are not what she expected. 

"I thoughl they were going to be 
more rustic," she said. 

Typically, there are about six 
students to a room, so it can gct a 
hit cramped. The students share a 
living room, bathroom and dining 
room, and hence, generally do 
everything together. 

There are also state-of-the-art 
computers and lab facilities. All of 
the meals arc prep\lred for the stu-
dents, and their laundry is also 
done for them. 

"It's great," said Dinh Nguyen, a 
student who stayed at the 
Monteverde site. "They do every-
thing for you." 

At both programs, research and 
studying are the main focus. 
Students take a total of four classes. 

"All of the 
students from 
UCSD kicked our 
butts on statistics 
and ecolog. They 
helped us, and we 
learned a lot from 
them. They 
obviously have 
much beHer 
preparation 
courses In these 
two areas than any 
of the other UCs." 

- Unnamed UC student 

At Monteverde, students take a 
course in tropical diversity, a tropi-
cal community ecology course, an 
independent study course and a 
Spanish language/culture/agricul-
ture course. At Las Cruces, the 
courses are similar, although the 
biology courses focus more on 
agroccology and applied ecology. 

The courses at both programs 
are similar 10 upper-division class-
es taught at UCSD, except that stu-
dents spend much more time wilh 
professors, TAs and field inslruc-
tors. 

In each program there are typi-
cally two or three well-known pro-
fessors, two or three TAs doing 
graduate work in related fields and 
occasional guest lecturers. Less 
than 20 students, selected from all 
the UC campuses, participate in 
each program. The program is a 
very intense and intimate experi-
ence. 

"It was the toughesl and the 
best quarter I've had," said 
Nguyen. 

To prepare for Ihe program, 
UCSD students must not only com-
plete several biology and ecology 
courses, a statistics class and the 
general EAP requirements, but it is 
recommended that students study 
Spanish. 

This is a lot of preparation com-
pared to the other UC eampuses, 
but because of the requirements, 
UCSD students do much better in 
the program, said Molly Ann 
McCarren, an EAP advisor. 'The 
reason that our students have the 
extra prerequisites, is so they are 
the beSI prepared," said McCarren. 

"All of the students from UCSD 
kicked our butts on statistics and 
ecology," wrote a student from 
another campus on his evaluation 
of the program. 'They helped us, 
and we learned a lot from them. 
They obviously have much better 
preparation courses in these lwo 
areas than any of lhe other UCs." 

"We ended up basically helping 
everyone else," said Nicole Martin, 
who stayed in Las Cruces. 

While somc of the returning stu-
dents felt the preparation was bene-
ficial, othcrs, like Boone, felt too 
prcpared. SI .! said the first two 
weeks wert like a review for 
UCSD stude ts. 

Because uf the field research 
and long hikl " students are expect-
ed to be in good physical condition. 

Unlike () I her EAPs, students 
need not hav ..: extensivc study in a 
particular language. Fluency in 
Spanish is important; however, it is 
not required. All of the classes, 
except the Spanish class, arc laught 
in English. 

Alex Trillo, a retuming student 
from Monteverde, said that many 
students could not speak a word at 
the beginning of the program, but 
were speaking whole sentences by 
the end of the program. 

"I got there and I knew very Iit-
lie Spanish, but I ended up getting 
by," said Martin. "Ileamed a lot -
you're kind of forced to." 

While students are expected to 
aHend class, ~ take tests,

GHANA: 
Africans not just 
'fighting and dying' 
ContInued "... ...,. 11 
ty .. .Itook that home with me." 

Bonnes spoke of his favorite 
aspect of the culture in Ghana. 

"I appreciated the willingness 
of the people to share whatever 
they had even though they had 
very little," he said. "They arc the 
best friends that you could ever 
a~k for." 

Shendc said that the culture is 
more communal in Ghana and 
that it is common for hoth male 
and female roommates to push 
thei r beds together and to share 
one bed to create a space. 

"The society is so incredihly 
homophobic that men freely hold 
hands in the street becausc il 
would not occur to anyonc that 
they might he gay," Shendc said. 
"It's not really an option." 

Shende said that there is a 
double standard for Icsbiani sm. 

" It is fairly common for 
female roommates to have an inti-
mate relationship called 'S upi .' 
It's not really talked about hut it' s 
accepted," Shende said. "But 
these women always get married 
eventually." 

Going ahroad to Ghana gave 
both students a new perspective 
on the world. "I took a camel ride 
out of Timbuktu and stayed with 
desert nomads," Shende said. 
"They lived in a tent with a few 
mats to block out the sand and 
only had what could be easily 
packed on two camels. It was a 
lesson in materialism." 

"The average per capita 
income of C)hana is about $364," 
Bonnes ~aid. "The Ghanaians 
consider you rich i I' you arc for-
eign, and in actuality, you are 
rich. It highlighted to mc what is 
important and what isn't." 

The pace of life is much ~Iow­
er in Ghana and more relaxed atti-
tudes prevail. says Shende. 

"I have taken a vow never to 
ea t another meal in my car," 
Shende said. 

"Things like a power outage 
are turned into a chance to have a 
party;' Bonnes added. 

Both students commenled on 
the quality of education availahlc 
to Americans. Shende said that in 
Ghana it is difficult to find hooks 

publi~hetl afler 1950. 
"They are rcall y lacking 
resource~:' Bonnes said. 
"Education in Ghan a is a lot like 
taking tlictation." 

Bonnes says thaI his Afri can 
friends cxpressed concern over 
stereotypes of their countries in 
America. 

"They wanted Americans to 
know that Africans arc not always 
fighting and dying - thatthcre is 
more to Africa than strife - that 
they are people just like us," he . 
said. 

On the real value of going 
abroad, Shende said, "Everything 
is stripped but yourself. You learn 
about yourself because every-
thing else has changed." 

"Traveling outside your sur-
roundings is the best thing that 
you can do to improve your per-
spective," Bonnes said. "It helped 
me figure thing~ out ahout 
myself. It 's a huge planet, and we 
live on a very small portion of it." 

When asked for advice ahout 
traveling, Shende ~aid, "Expect 

'nothing and prepare for every-
thing. It will change your life."

TROPICS: 
Students get a taste 
of field research 
CoIItInued fro. ..... II 
most of the learning for this pro-
gram is done outside of the class-
room. Students go on many out-
door hikes and do a 101 of field 
research in the rain forests. 

'They get dirty, they get weI and 
they get billen," said McCarren. 
"And they stili don 'l care." 

Both programs also include sev-
eral field trips to a variety Costa 
Rican habitats. The Monteverde 
and the Las Cruces programs both 
begin with a trip. 

"When 1 got there 110 Costa 
Rica) , I couldn't believe it. It was 
so amazing," Nguyen sa id . " I 
thought 'wow, thi~ is whcre we get 
to study'!' " 

An integral pan o r the pro-
gram is the home-stays with IOl:al 
Spanish-speaking fami I i ell. 

Students in the Monteverde pro-
gram have a IS-day home-stay, 
whereas students in the Las 
Cruces program have four week-
end home-stays of two to three 
days each . A students' Spanish -
speaking ability is tested by the 
home-stays. 

Each student is introduced to a 
host family. Some students found it 
difficult 10 communicate with the 
families, while others had no prob-
lem. 

"[The weekend home-stays] 
were one of the hardest things I've 
ever done, but it was one of the best 
things about the program," said 
Martin. 

With the increased emphasi~ on 
internatio nal education , study 
abroad is now a reality and, possi -
bly, a necessity for many student s. 

Students say that one of the bellt 
Ihings about the Tropical Biology 
in Costa Rica program is that it 
gives ,tudent s insi ght inlo field 
n.:sean:h. 

The UCSD Guardian 

" There was some really 
demanding field work sometimes," 
Martin said. " You'd be in Ihe rain, 
in the mud, the jungle. Lots of bugs 
and stuff. You end up doing things 
that you have to do - that you did-
n'l think you could do before. 
You're pushed to some limit. 1 left 
there feeling empowered, 
stronger."

FACE: 
Never thought she 
would be teaching 
ContInued from ..... 17 
instead of physics. So 1 majored 
in math, married and went to 
Oregon." 

In Oregon, Brown studied 
computers. 

"A couple of years after that, I 
went into teaching," Brown said. 
" That was really different! 
During college, 1 would have 
told you I would never be a 
teacher!" 
Who Is the blgge.t Influence In 
your life? 

"Actually, aftcr being married 
Ihirty-live years, my hu~band is 
probably the biggest innuem.:e 
on my life, because we 've been 
together for longer than any 
other segment of my life," Brown 
said . 

" Other influen ce~ ilH: lude

always had fun . He was a 
delightful man. 1 think he had a 
big innuence over my view of 
the world." 
If you could choose to live dur-
Ing another time In history, 
which would It be? 

" I don ' t really Ihink there is 
one," Brown said . "1 really like 
now and I like now because I 
would rather have to deal with 
some of the issues of today than 
have to deal with Ihe limitations 
that women had 10 deal with in 
every other timc. Of alllhe times 
that I know about , I can ' t imag -
ine being myself in Ihose times. 
becau5e it would be so difficult 
dealing with the i~sucs Ihat Ihe 
women of those eras had to deal 
with ." 
Favorite Quote 

" There i s a quote lhat has 
sluck with me a long time," 
Brown said . " One o f my elemcn-

Broncos Get Bucked By Top 10 Tritons 
WINNING UGLY: The Tritons took to the pool against Santa Clara University last Friday and despite making numerous 
mental mistakes, they showed their championship mettle and came away with a 12-6 win, setting up a showdown with USC 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

It wasn' t the most impressive 
win in school hi story, but it was a 
win nonetheless. After all . winning 

ugly is beller than 
looking good and 
losi ng, right '! 

UCS D wil ter 
polo Head Coach 
Denny Harper 
showed a lac k of 
jubilance during 
Ihe game at hi s 
team's mult iple 

mental errors. He did have the sat-
isfaction, though, of watching hi s 
team improve to a IO-Y record with 
a 12-6 victory against Santa Clara 
Universit y in front o f a home 
crowd last Friday. 

The Tritons hit rough waters 
early and oft en. and it began with a 
Bronco two-pointer that was scored 
in the fir~t quarter with one second 
left on the shot clock that gave 
them an early lead . Ahhough the 
Tritons held the lead at the end of 
the quarter, the early Bronco score 
had shaken them up a lillie. 

Claire Schneider/ Guardian 
Vision: Jun ior Stephen Burkhalte r exam ines the pool and prepares to make a pass in UCSD 's 12-6 win last Friday at Canyonview Poo l. 

"The guy was practically lying 
on hi ~ hack and just kind of threw 
the ~hnt because the clock was run-
ning out ," ~eni or Adam Bollenbach 
said. "I don't know how, hut it just 
kind of went in and they went up 2-
0." 

UCSD wa~ motivated in the ~ec­
and quarter, and appeared to grah 

onto an insurmountable 7-2 lead. 
But life doesn't always stay ro~y 

unless you have a pair of red-tinted 
sunglasses, an it em the Trit ons 
apparently lac ked. Santa Clara 
outscored the Tritons by a goa l in 
the third quarter to hring them 
within striking distance of UCS D's 
seemingly slim 9-5 lead. 

At this point. Harper had a fcw 
choice words for hi s squad. 

'They scored goals that could 
have ea~ i Iy heen stopped and proh-

abl y ~ h () uld have been," 
Bollenhadl ~a id . " I think what 
Denny fH arper] was mad about 
was the two-pointer they scored in 
the thi rd quarter, whi ch was a 
defensive nmtake on our part. We 
were mak mg some turnovers a l ~o 
on orren<;l! th at we could have pro-
duced on." 

As is typi ca l of a team ranked in 
the lOp I (), t he Tritons held on ror a 
victory despite a "uh-par day in 
many aspects of t hei r pl ay. 

Champio nship teams win even 
when they don't play well. whi l.: h is 
a good sign for the Tritons. 

However, the team did suffer 
some bad news when so phomore 
Jason Boettner, who had been out 
with a spider bite and an injured 
hand, ~prai ned his ankle Friday 
night after the game. He will miss 
Ihe re~t of the season, which great-
ly hinder~ the Triton~' team speed. 

" It hurts us a lot because he's so 
fast and he ~ees the pool really 

well ," senior Romas Kudirka said. 
"Obv i ou~ l y hi s skill s will be 
missed. We were always hoping 
and waiting for him to get healthy 
and l:Ome back, but it didn ' t work 
out this year ... I thought I had bad 
luck, but he wi n~ ." 

Now the Tritons will gear up 10 
play the 0.2 ranked Uni versity of 
Southern California in Los Angeles 
011 Sa turday at I p.m. This week's 
practice will be key in preparing for 
the tough game.

Tritons Make It 14 Against Davis 
18-5: The No, 5 ranked Tritons put their 13-game winning streak on the line against Division II 
powerhouse UC Davis last Friday night and came away witp a resounding four-game victory 
By Stewe Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

Last year, in his first season at 
the helm of the UCSD women's 
volleyball team, Triton Head 

Coach Duncan 
McFarland led a 
seni or-dominat -
ed squad to 24 
wins and a berth 
in the NCAA 
Quarterfinals. 

Fo ll o win g 
such an auspi -
dous opening, it 

would seem that UCSD and 
McFarland would be in position to 
suffer the dreaded "sophomore 
slump" as he allempted to discov-
er new team chemistry. 

Northern California road trip, 
struggled and lost in four games. 

On Friday, UCSD established 
rrom the first serve that thi s was 
not going to be a repeat perfor-
mance as senior Sherine Ebadi 
fired a jump serve ror an ace. 

In recent matches, the Tritons 
have established a trend or getting 
down early and rallying back to 
win. Thi s was not going to be the 
case against Davis. UCSD took 
advantage of Aggie mistakes to 
consistently pass the ball and 
jumped to an early lead. 

The Triton offense looked to 
junior outside hiller Dana Salter 
and junior middle hlocker 
Shannon Noonan to provide the 
firepower that kept the Aggies on 
their heels. 

all cylinders, the Tritons used their 
tough serving, including four 
straight points by Jami e 
Hackleman, to take the first game. 

The second game saw the 
Aggies wake up from their slum-
ber a they called upon 6-foot -2 
middle blocker Kaersten Hill to 
lead the way. Hill blocked four 
straight points to opl!n the second 
game and put the Tritons in a big 
hole. Despite a late rally, UCSD 
could not close the gap and Davis 
took the second game, 15- 10. 

and is able to produce, so it's 
almost like all 18 of us are on the 
court." 

It must have seemed to the 
Aggies that the Tritons had 18 
players on the coun as UCSD con-
tinued to apply the pressure in 
front of a boisterous home I: rowd. 

Sensing that this could be 
another win to add to their streak, 
the Tritons continued to play well 
by digging a number of Davis kill 
atlempts and turning them into 
UCSD points. The Aggies had no 
response to the Tritons' aggressive 
play and UCSD took the game and 
the match, 15-10.

GAME 7: 
Hope is not lost for 
the National Pastime 
Continued from Pac. 24 
Game 7 - especially last night's. It 
redeemed everything. 

It was a forgellable first six 
games, but last night some new 
names were added to the illustrious 
legend of the October Classic. 

Mike Hargrove gambled on 21-
year-old Jaret Wright, and the gutsy 
youngster turned in a brilliant per-
fonnance for the Indians. 

Gria led veteran Tony 
Fernandez knocked in two runs in 
the third to continue hi s amazing 
clutch hilling. Bobby Bonilla then 
rocked a solo homer to bring the 
Marlins within one run . Edgar 
Renteria's smart throw home 
allowed the Marlins a chance in the 
bOllom of the ninth . 

Then it was previously unheard 
of Craig Counse ll who c:lpped the 
Marlin rally with a sacrilice fly, 
sending the game into ex tra 
innings. 

-

Well , any ideas of a ,econd-
year slide can he tossed OUI th,;: 
winduw after the Tritons defeated 
Div i, ion II power UC Dav is to 
record their 14th straight victory. 

From the middl e, Noonan 
racked up II kill s while Sa lter led 
UCS D with 23 ' kill s including a 
number of athletic, cross-court cut 
shots. With the offense fi ring on 

UCSD returned to form in the 
third game as McFarland looked to 
his bench to provide a spark. The 
Tritons responded to the call as 
Shannon Hawes, Alli son Bender 
and Dena Strube helped hllild an 
insurmountable lead and too" the 
third game, 15-10. 

'T hi s year there's more depth 
to our team that's heing used," 
McLain said . "We' re a whole team 
and everyone has an opponunity 

Following the match. the 
UCSD men's vo lleyball team pro-
vided one of thi s year's top athlet-
ic moments a~ they sl!rcnadcd the 
women's squad with "You've Lost 
That Lovin ' Feeling" while 
dressed in full l:amoullage allire. 

When you've won 14 in :1 row, 
even that can ~ound great. 

The t en ~e game continued until .." 
the botlom of the 11th. when the 
Marlins had runners on. 

"When we went to Texas, we 
learned that we can beat any team, 
no mailer what," sophoillure Jen

we've found a way to win . If we' re

Stinging sweal. Burning lungs. 
Aching legs. Most people don'l 
associate these words with the 
weekend, hut for the 
UCSD cro~s country team, 
it simply comes with the 
territory. 

Towards the end of the 
regular season, such trials 
seem trivial and common-
place. What has also 
become common-place, 
what makes all the pain so 
worthwhile, is the suecess the team 
has enjoyed. 

Building on a strong campaign 
la~t year that saw one woman qual-
ify for the individuals and the entire 
men 's learn compete in the 
National Finals, the Tritons have 
kept their momentum. The Tritons 
continued their march hack to the 
postsea ... on Saturday, with an out-
standing performance at the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association hampionships which 
saw the women finish lirst and the 
men second. 

The victory for the women 
marked Ihe [i'M-ever conference 

championship for UCSD in ten 
years of conference competition. 
The stellar team effort saw five 
Tritons finish in the top 10. Senior 
Kristen Koenig lead the way with a 

third-place overall finish 
and a sparkling time of 
19: 12. 

"I Koenig I just upped 
the ante to a new level 
again," said Triton Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdalc. 
"Her eyelids were almost 
dosed she was so relaxed. 
It was awesome to sec her 

compete like Ihal." 
The rest of the squad was hot on 

her heels, as all I 0 of the women 
finished within the top 22 in a race 
with over 50 participants. Maggie 
DWire. Courtney Gray, Amanda 
Wallace and Lisa Klinger finished 
out the top live scores for UCSD, 
all five earning All -Conference 
Awards in the process. 

It was a tremendom, race for the 
women, who had shown hits of 
bri lIiance throughout the season, 
but had yet to glue it all together. 
This weekend the women maxi -

throughout the year, and finishing

The men were no slouches 
either, turning in some terrific per-
fonnances en route to second place

strength in addition to his physical 
prowess.

seventh, followed by a five-man 
pack of Tritons led by James 
Nielsen and Mike Wallace. Not to 
he shown up, the men matched the 
women's marvelous performance 
by also finishing all 10 runners in 
the top 22. 

"We're very pleased so far," 
Harder said. "We're looking for-
ward to Regionals and Nationals." 

Now Triton sights are set on 
Regional Finals, where the team 
will face the best of Divi ' ion III 
west of the Mississippi . Though the 
competition i~ three weeks away, 
don't expect Ihe runners to get fat 
and lazy. Men and women both 
anticipate reaching National Finals, 
which can only be achieved by 
winning Regionals. In the mcan-
time, the squad hopes to recover 
from minor bouts with injuries and 
illness. 

"I don 't think Ithe layofll will 
make mut:h difference," said Amy 
Kitchen, wbo linished 11th overall. 
"It ' ll give us a nice rest before
