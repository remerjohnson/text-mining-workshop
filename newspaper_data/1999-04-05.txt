Bottled Water 
Companle. Sued 
BERKELEY - In response 
to a recent study on the puri-
ty of bottled water, the 
Environmental Law 
Foundation filed a lawsuit 
last Monday against eight 
bottled water companies for 
violating state health stan-
dards . In a study of 103 
brands of bottled water, the 
Natural Resources Defense 
Council (NROC) has alleged 
that eight California bottled 
water companies may be seil-
ing water that is not as pure 
as advertised. The 
Environmental Law 
Foundation named Crystal 
Geyser, Alhambra, 
Apollinaris, Safeway, Lucky, 
Ralph 's, Vittel and Vol vic in 
the lawsuit. In addition, the 
NROC found that one-third 
of the brands of bottled water 
te ted contained high levels 
of harmful contaminants that 
exceed state health standards.

campus goes further to under core 
that," said Richard Auiyeh, UCSD 
vice chancellor for research and

of Style booth. Students stood in 
lines to have a photograph of their 
face with a UV camera taken and 
analyzed for sun damage. Students 
then received a consultation on skin 
care and cosmetic color matching, 
in addition to some Neutrogena skin 
care samples. 

"They told me that I had major 
sun damage and needed to see a 
dermatologist," Cathryn Cade said. 
"They ' re informing me about 
things that I need to check out that 
I never noticed before. They 
emphasized the sun products and to 
be aware of the skin." 

Another popular booth gave stu-
dents a chance to OJ with tips from 
OJ JS One. On five sets of turnta-
bles, students were taught how to 
scratch records and mix music. 

" It's pretty fun but it was a lot 
harder than I thought," Nick Olney 
said. 

Rape, Abuse and Incest National 
Network (RAINN) also sponsored a 
booth with 1-800 COLLECT that 
worked together to raise awareness 
on campus and to gather informa-
tion for a survey of UCSD students. 
Students were asked questions on 
issues uch as gun control. Self-
defense tactics were also demon-
strated by RAINN to educate and 
encourage enrollment in self-
defense classes on campus. 

"What they're basically trying 
to do is to educate and let people 
know about self-defense and rape 
and how often it occurs and ways 
to prevent it:' Meena Haidari said. 

Best Buy also sponsored the 
New Music Vinual Video booth 
where students eould view new 
music videos on a vinual headset.

Part two o/the Mary Higgi~s Chronicle: Diary of a Freshman. 
In this installment, Mary explores unrequited love in an angst ridden 
relationship, that eventually blossoms into an everlasting friendship. 

MARY HIGGINS' 

NIcholas Runco/Guardi/ll1 

W
hen I uneanhed my diary from freshman year almost a month ago; I 
expected I would find gushing entries about dormitory life, elas es 
and homesickness. These elements were present" of cours~, yet all 
were dwarfed by the large quantity of pages' I d enthUSiastically 
devoted to "The New And Exciting World of College Guys" ... actlt-
ally, to one guy in panicular. The story I'm goi ng to tell you is about 

my first college crush, which had a significant impact on my life. 
The first time I ever saw him, his dark eyes spark led with mischief and 

his head was tilted back in throaty laughter. His name was Sam. I thought 
to myself, "He looks like trouble." 

And they say there's no such thing as woman's intu ition. 
That wa almost five summers ago at Warren college orientation; we 

wound up in the same square-dancing group. I don't want to go on and on 
about how attractive I thought he was so l' II leave it at this: his presence took 
the sting out of square dancing and made me glad that I hadn't spent the 
night protesting this ridiculous pastime in my donn room. 

Soon orientation was over. r got on the plane, new back to San Jose, 
forgot about Sam, and dove into a shon-lived but interesting romance with 
a badly-behaved Mormon from my high school. 

Well , maybe I didn't completely forget about Sam. September rolled 
around and I discovered that Sam was living just downstairs from me with 
a friend of mine. When the friend introduced.us, I perked up and said, "Oh, 
we 've already met! I was your 'allemande left!'" 

Sam stared ill me blankly and said, "Oh yeah. What 's up?" 
Despite the obvious fact that he had no clue who I was, I quickly forgave 

him and I staned spending a lot of time down in that sui te. (Here's an interest-
ing aside: if you look up the "plan" for my e-mai l account, it says that I lived at 
"Suite 308, 24-7." This was Sam's suite, not mine - Sam's roommate hacked 
into my e-mail account freshman year and changed my plan just to be funny.) 

That quaner Sam grew on me in a major way. Looking back at my 
diary, I realize that by Thanksgiving I was hooked. 

Nov. 27, 1994: Thank giving [weekend] was everything I'd hoped it 
would be, but I'm excited to go back to S.D. agai n and see my friends ... 
especially a cenain datk-haired, attractive babe on the third noor. Yes, I am 
speaking of none other than Sam, the man who currently rocks my world. 

I nined, I teased, r hinted. I waited months for Sam to finally notice me. 
'1 paid elose attention to everything he did, looking for hopeful signs. And 
he did seem to be warming up to me. 

March 25, 1995: Lately he's been more affectionate. Like, he'll nudge my 
fOOl with his toe or something stupid like that. He' ll tickle my feet through my 
socks instead of just yanking them out from under me. That's a joke between 
us. A couple month ago, when all of us were standing around in the hallway, 
Sam noticed that the toes of my socks were bagging out slightly. So the 
dummy ju t reached down and yanked them, pulling my feet right out from 
under me! I fell on my ass in front of everyone. I was so mad at him. He just 
stood there laughing his head off like a fool. 

That was how I leamed where the expression "head over heels" came 
from. I noticed there were other 
cute guys at UCSD, but none of 
them could compar~ to Sam. His 
effervescent charm and ca ual flin-
ing drove me crazy, to the point 
where it stopped being fun ' and 
games and started 10 closely 
resemble torture. 

"I have to tell him!" I said to my 
friend Wilma late one miserable night. 

Saying that and doing that were two different things, however. What if 
he laughed at me? What if he got mad? Worse yet, what if the confession 
caused embarrassment and discomfon between us that would permanent-
ly ruin our friendship? 

Bluning out my feelings seemed 100 ri sky. Instead I turned up the heat 
by nining more open ly, pumping his ;'ro 'nds for information and everything 
else short of moving into hi dorm room. Still, he remained a mystery. 

I held out until May. May I to be exact - almost II months since I'd 
first laid eyes on him. Up in my suite, Wilma p yched me up with a motiva-

HOROSCOPES 
ARIES 

March 2 1 - April 19 
You' ve got a massive dose of 

spring fever ;uJay, most likely. 
You would jU'. i as soon chuck 
everything an" lake off for the 
woods. )f you've got ajob you care 
about , of course, that 's not a very 
good idea. On the other hand, 
Thursday and Friday should be 
good for Iinding a new job (his 
week. (7) 

TAURUS 
April 20 - May 20 

The urge to splurge is strong 
today, and you might be feeling 
resistant , just on general principles. 
If the deal is really good, go for it. 
An opportunity like this might not 
come again for quite some time. 
Don't let anybody push you into 
anything, however. You can tell the 
difference. (6) 

GEMINI 
May 21 -June 21 

Initi al opposition leads to a 
team effo rt , which should prove 
to be success ful. Looks like 
everylhing ends well , but perhaps 
not in the way you envisioned. Be 
open-minded and ready to mov'e 
quickly. (8) 

CANCER 
June 22 - .lu~y 22 

Your mind is quick and you 
have plenty of good support from 
people who love you. But you' re 
also up againsl a major adversary 
right now. This other person wants 
to order you around, and you' re 
fi nding it hard to comply. If it's for 
your own good, maybe you should 
surrender instead. Trust only those 
who are trustworthy. (8) 

LEO 
.f1.t~y 23 - Aug. 22 

Something that looks very good 
for you could look kind of threat-
ening to a person you care a lot 
about. Although you' ve pretty 
much made up your mind, consult 
this person for advice, and heed the 
directive to be cautious. It will 
make you even more successful. 
Let those who you love and care 
about you know how much they 
mean to you. Take advantage of the 
feeling that you have, and make it 
work in your re lationship. (8) 

VIRGO 
Aug. 23 - Sept . 22 

You could make a very good deal 
today, but take care. Although you 
might li nd a good bargain, this item 

may not be quite what you expected. 
Examine it carefully before you get 
home, so you will know what, if 
anything, you' ll need to fix . (5) 

LIBRA 
Sept. 23 - Oct. 22 

This day should be very interest-
ing. Get over your resistance to fol-
lowing another person's orders and 
you could learn quite a lot. Learn-
ing how to playa new game could 
lead to lots of new friends. Follow a 
strong leader, and enjoy it. (6) 

SCORPIO 
Oct. 23 - Nov. 21 

You could experience a major 
transformation today in the way 
you view money. For example, you 
may generally think of yourself as 
a poor kid, but today realize that 
you' re fabulously wealthy, com-
pared to somebody else. Satisfac-
tion is a matter of viewpoint, so 
today, shift yours 10 a more com-
fortable posi tion. (4) 

SAGITTARIUS 
Nov. 22 - Dec. 21 

This ought to be a beautiful day 
for you, and it is also a good day to 
start new and better habits. 
Remember all those resolutions 
you made around the first of the 

Monday, April 5, 1999 

year? Well, why not put them into 
effect right now, while you' re in an 
excellent mood'! Get rid of the stuff' 
that causes stress, for starters. (6) 

CAPRICORN 
Dec. 22 -Jan. 19 

There's a lot going on today, but 
you can keep a low profile. Figure 
out which way the wind is blowing 
before you decide how to set your 
sails. Is that too many metaphors for 
one paragraph'! Just play it cautious 
until you see who's in control. (8) 

AQUARIUS 
Jan. 20 - Feb. 18 

Your friends are the spark of 
your life and your inspiration 
today, so let them know how much 
you appreciate them. The people 
you love the most are the ones most 
likely to be taken for granted, 
except for today, of course. Go 
ahead and get emotional about it. 
They' ll love it. (6) 

PISCES 
Feb. 19 - March 20 

You can amass quite a fortune 
today and tomorrow if you play your 
cards right. You're lucky, of course, 
and that always helps, but today, 
skill is requi red too. Take only a very 
carefully calculated risk. (S)

PSYCHO: 
Friendship develops 
out of major crush 
CoatIIIued tro. ..... I 
tional speech. Inspired, [ trooped 
down to the third floor to give Sam 
a piece of my mind ... and found 
him watching television with three 
of his roommates. [ sat down with 
them, trying to work up enough 
nerve to get Sam alone in his room 
and confront him. Twenty minutes 
later, [ completely chickened out 
and high-tailed it back to Wilma, 
resulting in more whining, more 
moti vational speeches and finall y a 
second attempt. Once again, [ did 
the "Walk of Angst" down to his 
suite. This time, Sam was sitting 
alone in the common room. 

Mustering up all my courage, I 
blurted out, "Can J talk to you for a 
second? [n your room? Alone'? 
Now?" -

I'll spare you the gory detai I . [ 
confessed and he very sympatheti -
cally and maturely gave me the "[-
Think-You' re-Nice-Too-But-Let 's-
Just-Be-Friends" speech. [ was sad 
but relieved to have unshouldered 
my little secret. Our fri endship con-
tinued as normal. 

Sophomore year [ linally got 
over Sam and wound up in my fi rst 
serious relationship. In January, 
however, the relat ionship ended bit-
terly. Sam - who was now one of 
my closest friend - consoled me. 
We were up late studying together 
several months later when he admit-
ted that he'd been having "feelings" 
for me. Shocked, [ spent the next 
few days asking myself, "00 [ still 
have feelings for him? )s the timing 
finally right?" I decided that [ cer-

tainly could be attracted to Sam 
again if I put a little effort into it. 

A week came and went and Sam 
didn ' t make a move. Finally, [ con-
fronted him about this and he said, 
rather surprised, "Oh, [ just wanted 
to let you know about these feel-
ings. I didn 't want to do anything 
about them." 

[ fe lt like killing him. Only by a 
Herculean show of strength did [ 
refrain from bashing his head in 
with hi s backpack. Shortly after 
that night, J got over him again -
this time for good. 

Sam and [ remained close 
friends throughout all of this melo-
drama. Over time, [ came to think 
of him as a brother. The subject of 
romance never came up again ... 
unti I junior year. 

"Remember when I made you 
cookies freshman year?" [ asked 
him. ") don't know what [ was 
thinking! Why would [ go th rough 
all that trouble for a jerk like you?" 

Sam gave me one of his famous 
grins and replied, "Because you had 
the world 's biggest crush on me'" 

That was his second brush wi th 
dea th in two years. I couldn ' t 
believe hc'd make a joke out of all 
the pain hc'd caused me. ) consid-
ered it a major breach of romantic 
etiquette ... ''Thou shalt not throw 
thy best friend ' unrequited love 
back in her face." 

[ very calmly stared him in the 
face and said, "You #*$(@&!" 

Something funny happened 
after that, though. I started taking 
more risks. "Confessing" my feel-
ings for people (not just love inter-
ests, but also my platonic friends 
and family members) became easi-
er and easier. Learning to be more 
honest and open about my feelings 

Thou shalt no 
longer covet. 

The UCSD Guardian 

was less like the "Walk of Angst" 
and more of an everyday occur-

. rence. On a romantic level [ got 
shot down sometimes, but that was 
beside the point. [ no longer felt 
ashamed of how [ felt . [f [ had a 
crush on a guy, [ didn ', feel that it 
was a weakness or that it made me 
unbearably vulnerable. 

Last month [ typed up the "Best 
or' my diary entries about Sam and 
gave them to him as a gi ft , with the 
admonition, "[f you give me any 
grief about this, I'll make you pay!" 
The writing was unsophisticated at 
times (I' m thinking in particular of 
the sections in which J referred to 
him as a "major lnega-babe"), and 
humorous in other parts. It was also 
a little sad, too, because ) remember 
how painful it was to be completely 
and utterly infatuated with someone 
[ could not have. 

The most interesting aspect of 
myoid journal entries about Sam is 
that my open admirati on for him 
has not changed over time. He is 
sti II one of the smartest guys I've 
ever met, and one of the fu nniest. 
He has a killer smile and oodles of 
charm. He has changed in some 
ways, of course. For example, he 
has not once tried to yank Illy socks 
out from under me si nce [ sta rted 
taking Kung Fu lessons. 

Fre hman year, [ wrote in my 
diary that) didn 't think I'd ever get 
over Sam and in trulh [ never real-
ly did, even though my adoration 
for him has changed from border-
line hero-worship to plain old, run-
of-the-mill friendship. His name 
really isn' t "Sam" of course. [ had 
to use a pseudonym to protect his 
identity because he's still a student 
at UCSD. He's also still one of my 
best friends in the world .

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 
ASSOCIATED STUDENTS ELECTION GUIDE 

Thr Ar '()(iated StudenL~ Council affect'; the life of every undergraduate at UCSD, whether they realize it or not From orga-
11izing ti ll ~un God Festival to lobbying the UC Regents, the A.S. Council officers play important roles on campw; and beyond. • 

ConsI"l1uently, it is critjcal that students carefully rvaluate the candidates and issues debated this and every election se.a-
son. In n;ntrast to past years, nearly all the A. . candidates tl1is year are extraordimuily well-qualified. They come from 
varied backgrounds yet all share a commitment to serving their fellow students. 

The Gwuuian endorsements were reached after interviewing candidates, evaluating their past performances as elected 
repre.sentatives, and deliberating over their le.adership potential. Our choice.s are based on a desire to elect candidates whom 
we feel wjll make significant contributions to the A. . Council and the student body.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 
ASSOCIATED STUDENTS ELECTION GUIDE 

• 

reSl 

STEPHANIE 1ER1ZMAN 
The A.S. Council president represents 

the student body to the administration and 
the outside community, works on issues 
both internal and external 10 UCSD. ami 
determines whether the A.S. Council sinks. 
swims or merely tloats. When electing a 
president to lead the A.S . Council and repre-
sent the entire student body, it is crucial that 
students choose a candidate who has the 
experience, character and determination 
required of a student leader. This year, the 
candidate who has the leadership. vision and 
desire to create change and put students first 
is Stephanie Lertzman. 

Lemman's extensive involvement in stu-
dent activities and leadership posi tions is 
impressive. Since October 1996, Lcrtzman 
has served on the Warren College Student 
Council. She has held the position of judi-
cial board member, "Warren Live" co-com-
missioner, commissioner of programming 
and currently holds the position of Warren 
college council president. Lertzman was an 
ex-officio member of the A.S . Council this 
year and attended the vast majority of the 
A.S. Council meetings. We believe that her 
involvement with the A.S. Cou~cil. along 
with her Warren Council experience and lJer 
extraordinary drive, will help to efficiently 
run the A.S. Counci I and create a more stu-
dent-friendly campus. 

Lertzman is also involved with other stu-
dent activities, including the Resident 
Dean's Advisory Committee and Warren 
programming. She served as a Resident 
Advisor for Warren college. Lertzman 's 
experience with many kinds of UCSD orga-
nizations and activities makes her a very 
well-rounded candidate for A.S. president , 
one who understands the campus as a whole. 

UCSD needs Ii president who i focused 
on what UCSD students need. Lertzman 
said she wants to move from the Warren 
College Student Council to k .S. president 
because she loves UCSD and wants to make 
it a more student-friendly campus. By unify-
ing the UCSD community, increasi ng diver-
sity on campus and improving student life 
(both on and oil campus). we believe 
Lcrtzman will make UCSD a better place 
for all students. 

One idea that Lertzman wants to bring to 
UCSD is "Brag Tags." These would be sim-
ilar to the letter cards posted in restaurants 
showing customers how they are rated by 
the Department of Health in Los Angeles. 
The "Brag Tags" would be a compilation of 
evaluations from students on how helpful 

student services are. We believe this idea 
could be effective in holding studenl ser-
vices and departments accountable. 

Lertzman 's ideas will make the A.S. 
Council serve students better. Some si mple 
ideas that she has will drastically improve the 
efficiency of the A.S. Council, such as not 
allowing members to leave council meetings 
unless there is an emergency and creating a 
committee to review the A.S. 
Council constitution and 
bylaws. So far there 
have been several 
ineffecti ve allempts 
by A.S. Coun il 
members to pass a 
new constitution. 
Appointing a 
committee to the 
task may solve 
the problems 
once and for all. 

Lertzman plans 
to increase school 
spirit by introducing a 
Triton mascot costume to 
use at sporting events and day-
time festival activities. She also suggests 
dying the Price Center fountain blue during 
quarterly spirit nights. Lertzman will focus 
on individual organizations and student ser-
vices, such as expanding the number of 
items students can rent from Outback 
Adventures. 

Although Lcrtzman. has many ideas to 
improve parking and safety on campus -
such as lobbying for more student spaces ,in 
the crowded lots and increasing lighting in 
dim areas - some of her ideas appear-unfea-
sible - such as placing signs indicating 
whether lots are full at the entrance to cam-
pus parking lots. However, we feel Lertzman 
has the tlexibility to adopt the other council 
members' ideas. Lertzman's tlexibility and 
willingness to do what is best for students 
will lead to a productive presidency. 

In previous years, slates such as Student 
Action Now! Legalize It, Students First! and 
Revolution have dominated the A.S. 
Council presidency. Lasi year however, A.S. 
President Joe Leventhal changed the scope 
of UCSD student politics when he ran inde-
pendently of any slate and won. 

In the past. there has been much conllict 
in the past within theA.S. Council when dif-
ferent ideologies from two slates clash. The 
fact that Lertzman in running as an indepen-
dent candidate will help resolve conllicts 
that arise. Not only is she not tied to either 
slate, she plan to srart the year with a "clean 
slate," to create an atmosphere in the coun-
cil where the focus will be to serve students 
in the best way possible. 

Though Lertzman has experience in stu-
dent govemment, she is not an A.S. Council 
insider. We feel she will be tlexible enough 
to both push for her own ideas and adopt 
those of other council members - whichev-
er benefit the students more. Lertzman 
impressed the Guardian editorial board a 
an earnest and honest candidate - rare 
qualities for a politician. 

Lemman is a hard worker whose atti -
tudes toward the job of A.S. president will 
help create a better A.S. Council, which will 
serve the students more efti ciently. Her 
many ideas to change UCSD in small ways 
will add up to help improve student life in a 
big way. Lertzman 's experience in a diverse 
number of student organizations gives her 
the experience LO lead UCSD in the next 
school year. Therefore, the Guardian editor-
ial board enthusiastically endorses 
Stephanie Lemman for A.S. president. 

PATRu 
Pat Ru, the Students First! candidate, is 

currently A.S. vice president finance and has 
been in volved with the A.S. Counci l since 
he arrived at UCSD. 

As vice president finance, Ru has earned 
recognition for working hard and for being a 

worthy opponent against President Joe 
Leventhal. Ru has been the 

vocal leader of the 
Students First! slale all 

year, working hard to 
make sure that the 
slate's goals have a 
chance of becom-
ing a reality. 

Unfortunately, 
Ru 's major tlaw is 

that he lacks the 
abi lity to compro-

mise and to deal well 
with any form of 

opposition. Indeed, he 
lacks the ability. not only to 

deal with student opponents, but 
also to deal with administrators. At the 
recent SRTV television debates, Ru publicly 
said that he believes students and adminis-
trators do not get along. Ru has being work-
ing in student government for quite some 
time. During this time, he has had contact 
with numerous administrators. We would 
hope that after spending extensive time with 
administrators. while serving as a represen-

TESH KlmLLAR 
Tesh Khullar, who is running on the 

Change slate, has a lot of A.S. experience. 
He served as the Warren sophomore fresh-
man senator four years ago, as the W:rrren 
sophomore senator lhree years ago and as 
the commissioner of student advocacy two 
years ago. Khullar, who losi his bid for A.S. 
president last election season, has spenLthe 
last year out of student politics. In this time, 
Khullar aid that he gained a better under-
standing of what it means to be an average 
UCSD student. . 

If elected, he would like to work to 
improve on-campus parking by instituting a 
"yellow means yellow" policy. Under this 
policy, only students with yellow permits 
could park in yellow spots. Khullar brought 
an impressive amount of paperwork into his 
interview, including statistics on the amount 
of cars in yellow spaces at peak hours of the 
day. Two of Khullar 's other priorities are to 

. help students find more affordable off-cam-

tati ve of the student body. Ru would haw 
been left wilh the impression that studenlS 
and administrators can get along, nol tllat 
Ihey are natural adversaries. 

Ru has accomplished SOme things while 
in office, though not as much as he claims. 
He maintains that he increased student orga-
nization funding by 40 percent. Although 
Ru calls himself a "visionary," ideas alone 
do not generate large sums of cash. Student 
organization funding increased this year 
because the campus activity fee, which 
funds the Associated Students, was raised 
from $ 13.50 to $20. Ru did not lobby for the 
increased act ivity fee or write the A.S . bud-
get, so it seems a little strange that he took 
the credit for the funding increase. 

If anything, though, Ru is good at tak ing 
credit for things he did not do. A perfect 
example of this was the recent visi t by Maya 
Angelou that Ru claims to _have organized. 
In actuality, the visit was mostly arranged by 
Commissioner of Programming Snehal 

aik, not Ru. 
Another example of Ru 's unprofessional-

ism was his behavior during Ihe A.S. consti -
tution debate. Ru co-authored a constitution 
proposal with Leventhal. However, when it 
became clcar that the proposal was unpopu-
lar with the rest of the counci I, he stopped 
defending it. Ru , without removing his 
name from the document, stood back and let 
Leventhal take all the criticism. Ru 's behav-
ior was unfair to Leventhal and uncalled for. 
This is not the person we want running our 
student government. 

pus housing and to increase student comput-
er access. 

When as ked who he thought was the 
best A.S. president in the past three years, 
Khullar said that while he thought that 
Students First! slate member Co leen 
Sabatini , the 1996-97 pres ident , excelled 
at dealing with systemwide issues, current 
President Joe Leventhal has succeeded 
both at rai sing student awareness of the 
A.S. Council and at systemwide issues. It 
i interesting to note that Khullar did not 
mention 1997-98 Pre ident Souley Diallo, 
who he ran on the same slate with two 
years ago. The falill that Khullar was able 
to look beyond hi s former slate when 
coming to a decision is impressive. 

However, we decided against endorsing 
Khullar because he does not seem to he as at 
ease dealing with students as Lertzman. If 
the A.S . president is to function effectively, 
he or she must be able to accurately size up 
student opinion. At this point in his political 
career, we are concerned that Khuflar is not 
up to the task.

Vice-
reSl 

ASSOCIATED STUDENTS ELECTION GUIDE 

JENNIFER LEE 
The oflit:e of vice president internal is one 

that both t:andidates agree needs to be 
expanded. While the o'li t:e currently handles 
matters wi thin the A.S. Count:i l, the vice 
president internal office should reach out to 
all students at UCSD. 

Although both candidates are well qual i-

lied to !ill the offi ce, we feel that 1cnnifer 
Lee, the Students First! candidate, is the bet-
tor candidate for the job. 

As vice president internal , Lee said she 
would like to continue reaching out to stu-
dents by offering free promotional items in 
exchange for feedback through surveys. In 
the past, thi s been a suct:essful way for the 
A.S. Count:i l to measure student opi nion. 

Lee also proposed a weekend retreat for 
student organizations and A.S. Council mem-
bers. Events such as these would be another 
way for counci l members to bridge the gap 
between themselves and the general student 
body. 

Within A.S. Counci l, Lee would like to 
see enators more involved and informed on 
the issue . Senators already hold most of the 
voting power on A.S. Council; with several 
new constitutions proposing to transfer all 
voting power to the senators, we highly value 
a candidate who seeks a more involved and 
better informed senate. 

One of the main duties of the vice presi-
dent internal is to run the weekly A.S. 
Council meetings. As the current A.S. presi-
dent pro tempore, Lee has already effective-
ly run several council meetings. She has 
conducted those meetings in a fair and unbi-
ased manner, and we expect that she will do 
the same next year. In addition, in other 
areas of A.S. Council involvement, Lee has

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 
ASSOCIATED STUDENTS ELECTION GUIDE 

TERRENCE PATTERSON 
The Guardian believes that both candi-

dates for the position of vice president exter-
nal - Marshall Senior Senator Terrent:e 
Patterson and Marshall Sophomore Senator 
Maricela Marroquin - are extraordinarily 
well qualified. 

Marroquin, who is running on the 
Students First! slate, has spent the last two 

, 

• 

years working in the external affairs offi ce. 
In thi s capacity, she has attended numerous 
Uni versi ty of California Student Association 
(UCSA) conferences, in addition to manag-
ing a number of gra s-roots campaigns on 
campus. 

Patterson, who is running on the Change 
slate, has distinguished himself as a senator 
by acting as a liaison between the A.S . 
Counci l and local politicians such as Mayor 
Susan Golding and Representati ve Brian 
Bilbray, as well as by worki ng on several on-
campus issues. 

In addit ion to both being extremely well 
qualified, Marroquin and Patterson also have 
quite a few similar idea~, inc luding securing 
low-cost housing and transportati on for 
UCSD students and reat:hing out to local 
underprivileged students. Both t:andidates 
agreed that UCSD should work closely with 
the Preuss school and that affirmative action 
is not the best solution to increase enrollment 
of under-represented racial minority groups 
at UCSD. Marroquin and Patterson were 
adamant that education and opportunities 
need to be made avai lable to students well 
before they reach the uni versi ty level. 

In the long run, Patterson seems more 
likely to be able to at: hieve these objectives. 
He is already in the process of drafting -
wi th the help of some local politit:ians - an 
incentive program for developers of low-t:ost 
housing. As the student population at UCSD 

-when students read 
The New York Times, they 

have in their hands the very same 
resource that informs decisions 

and adioDS of world leaders 
around the globe. H

Vice President External 
continues to grow and the amount of housi ng 
on campus continues to remain the same, it is 
imperati ve that the A.S. Count:i l help t:urrent 
and future students lind alternati ves to on-
campus housi ng. 

Patterson is also in the process of trying to 
raise $250,000 for the A.S. Coum:il by seil-
ing vanity li t:ense plates to 
current students, faculty, 
staff and alumni . We 
are deli ghted to see 
that Patterson is 
looki ng for alter-
nati ves forms 
of funding for 
the Associated 
Students. The 
campus acti vi -
ty fee - which 
funds the coun-
ci l - was raised 
$6.50 per quarter 
last A.S. election sea-
son. If the A.S. Count:i l 
can secure alternative forms of 
funding, perhaps students t:an be pared a 
new fee increase in the upcoming years. 

Patterson differs from Marroquin when it 
t:omes to the role of UCSA, a UC-wide stu-
dent lobbying organization, and USSA, a 
national student lobbying group, in the 
external offi ce. Marroquin has very close 
ties to both organi zations, and says that the 

A.S. Council should support the advocacy 
agenda that UCSA drafts every year, but that 
the external affairs office has a responsibili-
ty to uphold the wishes of the entire t:ouncil. 
The advocacy agenda has led to tension 
between the vice pre ident external, who in 
years past has argued that the council should ' 

support the agenda in its entirety wi th-
out any substanti al review, and 

other members of counci l 
who think that they 
have a right to evalu-
ate the agenda point 
by point. 

Patterson says 
he believes that the 
A.S. Cou ncil 
should evaluate the 
agenda item' by 

item each year. He 
also thinks UCSA 

itself should be eva lu -
ated . Patterson said that 

62 percent of the UCSA 
budget , to whi ch UCS D con-

tributes a substanti al amount, goes to 
"overhead" each year. Patterson says that 
students have a right to fi nd out exactl y 
where there money is going, and we agree. 

In summary, although both candidates are 
qualified, Terrence Patterson has the political 
skill , fresh ideas and focus needed to lead the 
ex ternal office into the next century. 

Since California banned tobacco use in clubs, restaurants and bars, 
more and more people agree that being smoke-free is good for 
health, and good for business, 
_ A recent study published in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association reported that after the smoke-free workplace law 
went into effect, nearly 60% of the bartenders in the study who had 
experienced respiratory problems were symptom-free in just one to two 
months.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN

ASSOCIATED STUDENTS ELECTION GUIDE 

ERIC ROVNER 
Eric Rovner, the Students First! candidate, 

has what any potential A.S. vice president 
finance. should have - experience in the 
oflice and feasible ideas. In the last two years. 
Rovner has served in the linancc oflice, most 
recently as director of development, where he 

raised money for A.S. festivals. He was also 
on the A.S. finance committee and the Student 
Organization Funding Advisory Board 
(SOFAB). These positions have given Rovner 
the experience to understand the many facets 
of the vice president finance oflice. 

Rovner plans to work more with the pro-
gramming office on expanding evenL~ such as 
the Sun God Festival and Winterfest, as well as 
inviting more high-caliber speakers such as 
Maya Angelou to speak on campu . A strong 
partnership between the Iinance and program-
ming offices is key, for without the necessary 
funding. programming cannot create events 
that students wi II attend. 

Most importantly, one of Rovner's priori-
ties is to be accessible to students. He said that 
he believes in good "customer service," which 
he defines as having an open-door policy. He 
believes that the vice presidentlinance should 
be compassionate - especially toward the 
student organizations who are applying for 
funding. Considering how frustrated ome 
student organizations have been in the past in 
their attempts to receive financial support, it is 
good that Rovner understands that frustration. 

Rovner also has several key ideas for the 
finance office. He said he would like to have 
the SOFAB form, which student organiza-
tions must fill out to request funding, placed 
on-line. If this change occurs, it will greatly

streamline the process of preparing the

cut down on some of the problems that orga-
nizations have had in preparing these forms. 

the vice president finance does do the "number 
crunching," he or she must also work with 
other oflicers - especially the president - to 
decide how the A.S. monies should be spent. 

Change candidate Matt Powell has experi-
ence and ideas of his own. His experience as 
the finance officer of the Campus Crusade for 
Christ and the Hackey-Pong Club is important, 

Additionally, Rovner mentioned1he idea of

lSSlOnerS 
Academic Mfairs - ANDREA MENDEZ 

Andrea Mendez, running on the Studerus 
First! slate, is an ideal candidate for commis-
sioner of academic affairs. Although she is 
running unopposed, it wouldn' t maller if 
Mendez had a truck full of challengers -
she would still be the best person for the job. 

Mendez has an endless stream of accom-
plishments. She served as the Muir freshman 
senator interim, is the .current academic senate 
researcher and is involved with C.R.EAT.E., 
UCSO' K- 12 outreach program. 

Mendez has a number of brilliant ideas. 
One of her main priorities is for the A.S. 
Council to survey academic departments 
and evaluate them from a student perspec-
tive. She said that the college writing 
sequences - Making of the Modem World, 
Oimensions of Culture, Humanities and 
Warren and Muir writing - should be eval-
uated according to how much they actually 
improve students' writing abilities. She is 
concerned that students are passing through 
the writing sequences without ever becom-
ing competent writers. 

In addition to reforming the college writ-
ing sequences, Mendez would also like to 
institute a "dead day" each quarter. The 
"dead day" would come immediately hefore 
finals and would be used by"Students as an 

extra day to prepare for final exams. This is 
a fantastic idea. As Mendez pOinted out dur-
ing her interview, it is ridiculous for a stu-
dent to have his or her last lecture for a class 
on Friday and then be required to take a final 
exam in the same class immediately after 
the week~nd . 

Mendez also thinks it is important for 
the A.S. Council to form a clo. e 
alliance with C.R.EAT.E. We 
couldn't agree more. If the 
A.S: Council really wants to 
make an impact on the com-
munity, it should reach out 
to both current and future 
students. Mendez, who plans 
on becoming a teacher, has a 
real grasp on the nuances of 
UCSO's outreach programs. She is 
the ideal person to build a permanent 
relationship between the academic allairs 
office and C.R.EAT.E. 

In summary, Mendez is the embodiment 
of everything students should want in an 
A.S . oflicer. She is experienced, profession-
al and full of wonderful ideas. The Guardian 
looks forward to having her serve as our 
commissioner of academic affairs in the 
upcoming year.

Communications - No CONFIDENCE 
The A.S. commissioner of communica-

tions plays a vital role in the lives of UCSO's 
mainstream and alternative student media. 
He or she ultimately oversees organizations 
such as Student Cable Works, The Walking 
Stick and the Koala. and must work to ensure 
they receive proper funding and equipment. 
The commissioner must also work to foster 

opportunities in which students 
interested in media-related 

careers can gain valuable 
hands-on experience. 

Communications major 
Seth Orvis has a vision for 
UCSO communications, 

but few suggestions fc~ 
making this vision a reality. 

Orvis' ideas of "bringing out 
the hidden aspects of the school" 

and boosting UCSO's chool spirit are 
commendable. However, to achieve this, he 
would need to do more than tape concerts 
and air them on UCSO television. 

Further, Orvis seems almost exclusively ' 
focused on UCSO's broadcast media, to the 
neglect of the campus' various alternative 
print media. Having never served in any pre-
vious student government capacity and 
without mcdia experience beyond his course 

work, Orvis lacks the necessary experience 
and campus awareness to be effective as 
commissioner of communications. 

Though Student First! candidate Bobby 
Kim may have more specific plans for the 
office, he, too, lacks experience. Kim, a com-
munications and theater major, has worked for 
Campuswatch Television, KSOT and SRTV, 
bilt has no student leadership experience. 

Kim says he would increao;e the number 
of UCSO's alternative media, as well as mar-
ket them to increase their audience. He also 
would "boost" KSOT by switching it to an 
A.M. station. While these ideas are admirable, 
Kim's idea of "upgrading" the equipment in 
the communications department is particular-
ly troublesome, as the Guardian does not feel 
that improvement of an academic department 
is an appropriate use of student activity funds. 

With new forms of media coming to life 
on this campus, and older forms dying off, 
UCSO communications is in need of strong 
leadership. Though both candidates are 
enthusiastic, they lack both the experience 
and knowledge that is necessary in such an 
office. The Gtlardian abstains from making 
an endorsement for this position and gives a 
vote of no confidence to the candidates for 
A.S. commissioner of communications.

dedicated to maintaining the high stan-
dards that services such as Soft 
Reserves, A.S. Lecture Notes and the 
Co-ops have maintained. In addi-
tion. undergraduates would benefit 
from a candidate concerned with 
the continued support of the Student 
Center itself. 

During thi s past year, the 
Students First 1 candidate Patty Yun has 
heen involved with A.S. Council as the 
Warrcn sophomore senator. Yun 's experience, ideas 
for improvements and opinions on issues critical to 
the position for which she is running make her not 
si mply the only candidate, but also the best person for 
the job. 

Yun 's priorities include a mandatory tour of 

Student Cable Works by the A.S. Council so that the 
two bodies can better understand each other. She 
believes this understanding will help A.S. Council 
members in their decision-making process. Another 
of Yun 's goals is to lower the cost of readers that 
many professors require students to purchase. She 

says this can be accomplished by working 
with professors to participate in a cheap-

er program through A.S. Lecture 
NOles rather than going to outside 
sources. 

Finally, the Guardian agrees with 
Yun 's position on bringing the 
Academic Success Program (A.S.P.) 

under the wing of Services and 
Enterprises. We agree with Yun that 

A.S .P. needs more time to develop as an 
organization. 

Yun has good ideas, experience and a willing-
ness to work with the campus community in order to 
further benefit both the student population and the 
organization she will serve. Therefore the Gllardian 
endorses Patty Yun for commissioner of services and 
enterprises.

The UCSD Guardian OPINION 17 

Referenda 
University Centers Expansion Fee - No 

The University Centers Fee Referendum 
addresses a valid i~ue on campus: over-
crowding. As UCSD attracts more and more 
students, the campus will need addi tional 
facilities to accommodate their extra-curricu-
lar and social needs. 

If this referendum passes. the university 
will hire architects to draw plans and $12 
million worth of construction will begin on 
an expansion of both the Price Center and the 
Student Center. The additional fee will only 
take effect once the construction is complete, 
which is projected to be in 2002. 

While the University Center ' Fee 
Referendum is admirable in theory. we are 
concerned that future students will be commit-
ted to fees that will continue to increase and be 
collected for an unspecified amount of time. 

Moreover, the uni versi ty will not hire 
architects until the referendum has passed. 
As a result , the student body has no idea what 
it is buying with this additional fee. At the 
very least, preliminary plans should have 
been drawn before placing this item on the 

find it 
sell it 
~U~RDlflN ClASSIFIEDS 

JUST fill OUT fI FORM U"ST~IRS 
IN THE STl.:DE"T CENTER 

ballot. UCSD 5tudents and administration 
need a contract that will specify exactly what 
the students will pay. and for how long. 

If the student body passes the referendum 
in this election, it would add a $25 per quar-
ter. per student increase to student 
fees once the expansion is com-
plete. Furthermore. every fi ve 
years an additional $5 
would be added to this fee 
to account for inflation. 
This steadily increasing 
fee would be added to the 
$37.50 each student 
already pays per quarter. 

The Guardian recognizes 
the necessity of planning for 
overcrowding and applauds the univer-
si ty for thinking ahead. The effects of the 
univer ity 's lack of effective planning for an 
overcrowded student body can already be 
seen in this year's housing and parking short-
ages. However, thi s does not mean students 
should rush blindly into paying additional 

fees. 
While the Univer ity Centers Advisory 

Board (UCAB), the committee overseeing the 
proposed improvements, has attempted to 
focus on student input, the ultimate decision 

as to what changes will be made ultimate-
ly lies with the administration. As 

student fees are funding the 
ex pansion and renovat ions, 
students should know what 
they are· buying before they 
approve this referendum. 

The referendum may ulti -
mately cost tudents nearly 
double the $12 million price 

tag already assessed for the 
construction. The additional cost 

for the construction comes from inter-
est; the construction will be paid for with bor-
rowed money that will not be paid ofl until 
construction is complete in 2002. 

One possible solution wou ld be for the 
university to place a referendum on the bal-
lot lhat would assess a one-time nominal fee 

to pay for the creation of specific and binding 
plans. These plans could be distributed to the 
student body and the University Centers Fee 
Referendum could again be placed on the 
ballot, this time before a more informed stu-
dent body. Students would know exactly 
what they would be funding , and more 
specifically how much it would cost. 

If the proposed fee passes, the student 
body will be committing future students to 
steadily increasing fees without any real 
knowledge of what those students will be 
fin ancing. 

The Guardian urges students to VOle NO 
on Fee Referendum Question One: 
EXj)ansion of the University Centers. 

Do you ~rove the proposed increase 
in the Umvmity Centers fee for rxpan-
sion of the Student Center and Price 
Center? Collection of fee is projected for 
academic year 2002.

The UCSO Guardian Monday, April 5, 1999 

Referenda 
Academic Success Program Fee - No 

If approved, the second fee referendum would 
result in the increase of $1 per student per quarter of 
the A.S. Student Activity Fee - an increase that would 
be used to fund the Academic Success Program 
(A.S.P.). 

Currently, A.S.P. is a registered student 
organization that receives funding from 
the A.S. Council. This fee increase 
would be used to expand its current 
programs - which include book-
lending, peer mentorship and exam 
archives. As a result, the organiza-
tion would receive close to $45,000 
annually to fund its programs. 

Although the A.S. Council would 
havl! oversight of A.S.P. 's operations, the 
GlIardian does not think that only one stu-
dent organization should have such a large amount of 
money earmarked for its services. No other student 
organization recei ves money directly from the A.S. 
Student Activity Fee. 

A.S.P. is also a very young organization. It has only 
been operating for one year. In our opinion, A.S.P. has 
not developed enough to have such a large budget. No 
other student organization - including those that have 
been established at UCSO for many years - has a 
budget 'even approaching what A.S.P. would have if 
this fee is passed. If an organization is to have an annu-
al income of approximately $45,000, it needs to be 
more established. 

In addition, there are innumerable inconsistencies 
in A.S.P. 's plans for use of these funds. The most glar-
ing of these is the category of the A.S.P. budget that 
states that 50 percent of its budget - approximately 
$22,500 - would go to unspecilied "A.S.P. projects." 
These projects would supposedly be used to improve 
"the academic success or retention of UCSO students.· .. 
Whi Ie this is a noble cause, A.S.P. does not offer a clear 

explanation of who will decide where the money will 
go and how the money would be a110cated to these yet-
unknown projects. 

Additionally, the description of A.S.P. 's peer tutor-
ing program states that the organization "will central-

ize the variety of tutoring services at UCSO" 
and will act "primari ly ... as a referral 

serv ice for students." Essentially, 
approximately $1,350 annually - or 
3 percent of its budget - would be 
used to refer students to programs 
such as O.A.S.I.S., with which we 
believe most students are already 

quite familiar. This amount of money 
is extremely high for a service that will 

reinforce what many students already 
know. 

Finally, the Guardian is concemed about the fact 
that our student fees - which are used to support the 
student organizations and programs that students pur-
sue extracurricularly - will be used to support an aca-
demic program. The administration is in the business 
of providing academic programs to students. If stu-
dents want a program such a~ A.S.P., they should COIl-
cern themselves with asking the administration to pro-
vide services such as O.A.S.I .S. with beller funding to 
expand its services. 

A.S.P. is a terrific idea; however, it is not ready for 
the funds that will be coming its way if this referendum 
is approved. The Guardian strongly urges voters to 
vote NO on Fee Referendum Two.

Referenda UP 1111 nlIM? , (studYlngt) 
SOAr W.~ 

(working!) Two-Week Spring B~eak 
To survey the campus' attitude toward a two-week 

Spring Break, the ballot poses the question of whether 
students would like this change to the academic calen-
dar. Though no direct action will be taken based upon 
this vote, the results will give the A.S. Council 
and university administration a better 
understanding of student sentiment. 

A two-week Spring Break would 
be a great cure for the burnout that 
students experience at the end of 
winter quarter. The current one-
week break passes quicker than the 
blink of an eye, especially for stu-
dents who have late finals and leave 
on Saturday or Sunday of linals week 
only to return five or six days later. 
Catching up on sleep alone can take two days. 
Moreover, for those who enjoy taking trips during 
Spring Break, a lwo-week Spring Break would be far 
beller because there would be enough time to travel as 
well as see friends and family, catch up on errands and 
get ready for spring quarter. 

For many students, Easter is an important holiday 
and with a two-week Spring Break, there is a better 
chance that Easter will fall on a weekend during the 
break. The extended break would spare students the 
hassle of retuming home after a week of school to 
spend Easter with their families . This calendar change 
would delinitely Fesult in morl' relaxed and prepared 
students returning for a third quarter . . 

Though there are many advantages to a two-week 
Spring Break, it is important to remember the numer-

ous disadvantages as well. UCSO students already 
begin summer break relatively late compared to other 
universities. A two-week Spring Break means that 
Summer Vacation will start a week later. Thus, students 

will be at a disadvantage when applying for sum-
mer jobs and internships. Many jobs and 

internships may even begin before the 
school year ends. Moreover, other 
summer schools may begin before 
our school year ends. This means 
that students will not be able to 
attend summer school at other uni-

versities. Graduation is also pushed 
back by a week and this can prove to 

be another inconvenience for students 
and families alike. 

In addition, there could be substantial costs to 
the university to extend the academic year by one 
week. Ultimately, these costs will be passed onto stu-
dents. 

Clearly there are many factors that must be consid-
ered before deciding whether a two-week spring break 
will be advantageous. Although the referendum ques-
tion is merely a survey, students shou ld sti ll consider 
the issue carefully before deciding.

By BrIan Welle. 
Staff Writer 

Opening Day is upon us and a 
young man 's (or woman 's) 
thoughts tum to baseball. Unlike 
March Madness, America's pas-
time slows the sports action 
down to a pleasurable crawl. 
As the season approaches, 
the idea of a hot day, a 
cold drink and a close 
ballgame brings a 
smile to our faces. Yet as 
the Padres begin to defend 
their title as National 
League Champs, the UCSD men's 
baseball team is in the midst of a 
exciting season of its own. 

With wins over last year's 
Division III National Champion 
and Division III Runner-Up, Head 
Coach Dan O'Brien 's squad has 
compiled a 13- 10 record and is 
looking toward the playoffs. 
Standing in the Tritons way are a 
number of high-quality Division III 
opponents, including last 
Saturday's opponents, University 
of La Verne. 

The weather was on the chilly 
side but the game was a bam-burn-
er, as the Tritons defeated the 
Leopards 8-7 with a four-run out-
burst in the eighth inning. 

The offensive star of the game 
was designated hiller Brian Terrell 
who smacked 2 home runs off 
tough La Verne pitching, including 
a two-run shot in the crucial eighth 
inning that brought the Tritons to 
within one. Overall, the contest 

was an offensive battle with a sig-
nificant lack of defense. The two 
teams combined for 9 errors in the 
game, with La Verne making twice 
as many as the Tritons. Most of the 
errors proved costly ; 6 of the 15 

runs were unearned in the game. 
• With respect to real 

pitching merits, UCSD 
hurlers surrendered 
only 4 earned runs 
collectively - John 
Gherini giving up 3 

and dependable relief 
pitcher Brian Hinson 

allowing a single earned run in 
the seventh. Hinson, giving up 3 
hits in his appearance, finished ofl'-
successfully for' Gherini as he has 
so many times this year and earned 
his first win of the season. 

Pitching for the University of 
La Verne figured more prominently 
with 5 earned runs allowed - three 
of which came in the eighth. 

Two of the six La Verne 
mishaps of the game ensued when 
a failed pickoff allempt by Robert 
Hernandez advanced Matt 
Merrifield to second. More luck 
came the Tritons' way when Kenny 
Fluharty reached first on an error 
by a Leopard third haseman mov-
ing Merrifield to third. Ryan Hill 
manufactured a fourth Triton run 
with a sacrifice tly to center field 
that brought home Merrifield to 
give the Tritons an 8-7 advantage. 

Merrifield's run was the edge 
that upped UCSD's record to 13-
10. The victory over the La Verne 

Panthers was a non-conference 
win, but nevertheless the Tritons 
score more points in the eyes of 
Division III organizations as far as 
a ticket to the playoffs is con-
cerned. With consistent offensive 
performances like Brian Terrell 's 2 
for 3, three RBI day and pitching 
efforts like Hinson's effective 
game-to-game stamina, UCSD will 
stymie its opponents when the 
postseason arri ves. 

It is also fair to say, on the other 
hand, that opponents' batting aver-
age against UCSD pitching is 
rather high with a mark of .288. As 
the season schedule winds down, 
starting pitchers will think about 
winding up so that their game faces 
are ready and their minds focused 
on throwing the right pitches in 
tough situations. 

With O'Brien's battle mentality 
being a motivating force this sea-
son, it is now - in the late going-
where key moments in a ballgame 
will be the difference between 
whether or not UCSD will be a 
playoff teani. 

The win over La Verne helped 
to establish the basis for such con-
viction needed to thrive in key situ-
ations because it gave the team a 
sense of just how good they really 
can play. 

"We're enjoying the win and 
we're back where we want to be," 
Ass!. Coach Brian Priebe Priebe 
said. "[Our success] is a mailer of 
getting the team to believe in 
itself."

APU stayed in the lead for good, as the 
Tritons were unahle to come from behind 
again in the same game, and the loss was 
made final by the score 9-5. 

The final game of the Power Bar Classic 
was just that, a dassic. UCSD faced a deter-
mined Claremont College team, looking to 
upset the Tritons. 

The game went into extra innings, as nei -
ther team could get any offense going for 
seven full innings. Harlan once again pitched 
a complete game, leading the Tritons in an 
exceptional defensive effort, as Claremont 
College scattered 8 hits over 8 innings. 

In extra innings, international softball 
rules put a runner on second base to raise the 
chances of scoring. The top of the eighth 
was very dangerous for the Tritons, as 

WORTHLESS: 

Claremont College had an outstanding 
opportunity to take the victory. Claremont 
scored once in the eighth, and had the hases 
loaded with only one out. However, a pop 
fl y to shortstop and a ground out to third got 
the Tritons out of the jam with minimal 
damage. 

Yet the pressure si tuation could not be 
more defined: the Tritons had to score 2 runs 
or lose the game and the tic for third plal:e in 
the tournament. 

Jeanine Cordero was placed on second for 
the Tritons, and reached third on Anderson's 
sacrifil:e bunt. Erin Bridges then walked, 
putting runners on the corners. Harlan then 
si ngled to right field , scoring Cordero and 
advancing Bridges to third. Harlan stole sec-

Every "article" is a Q&A - there are no 

articles. The photos are good, but the captions 
are cheezed. (Case in point: In a section about 
the amount 'Of money pros get from their 
sponsors for having their pictures run in a 
magazine, one caption reads, "Halfway into 
this tum, Seth Elmer's superior brain power 
kicked in and decided a small shift in weight 
would mean readable logos, hence turning a 
sick tum into pure profit" But what probably 
happened was that Elmer couldn't pull the 
tum, lost his halance, fell and the "photog" 

graciously rewarded him for it.) 
But the rawest part of the entire maga-

zine was it 's "Word" (as in "Word to yo 
Mutha") section. It contained a part called 
"Significant Surf Slang," which goes on to 
define surf lingo sUl:h as "Haired out," 
"New School" and "Going off." Here is 7W

To me. TW Surfs reposition-
ing of the Reef ad (they put it 
o n page 5 ) was a sy mbo lic 
move to show that this maga·

thought the planets in the surf

that magazine only comes out

cines, freely available from drug 
and grocery store shelves. Co-
caine was in Coca-Cola and 
some 40 other soft drinks as 
well. Morphine and heroin were 
two of the three most popular 
medicines; more widely used 
than today. When addidion oc· 
curred, it was dealt with as a 
medical problem. 

The addidion levell:'tad stabi-
lized at about 1.5% of the popu· 
lotion (the same as 1979 and 
1997) - despite recurrent media 
alarms over "epidemic" drug 
use. The impod of non·alcohol 
addidion on society before Pro-
hibition was so small that few 
historians bother to mention it. 
As Edward Brecher noted in 
1972, addids weren't treated as 
much of a problem because in 
fad they weren't much of a 
problem. However, no historian 
fails to note the devastation 
wrought by Prohibition, starting 
in 1920. 

Prohibition was our first uto-
pian quest for a "drug free" 
America, and the arch villain 
was alcohol. Then as now, alco-
holics outnumbered heroin and 
cocaine add ids combined, by 
more than 5 to 1. Voters were 
told that one drink led to certain 
addidion and that alcohol was 
responsible for nearly all of the 
crime and most of the insanity in 
America . Dodors even sug-
gested to alcoholics that they 
become addided to morphine 
or heroin to stop their crazed 
and violent behavior. 

After passage of the 18th 
Amendment, reformers prom-
ised : "we will soon live in a 
world that knows not alcohoL" 
America became swept up in 
Prohibition fervor - some peo· 
pie also wanted to prohibit the 
dreaded and ever dangerous 
"Hesitation waltz". Two 5 to 4 
Supreme Court decisions in 
1919 reinterpreted a 1914 tax 
ad so that, in effed, heroin, 
[AND) cocaine were alsa pro· 
hibited. 

Prohibition allowed Vollmer 
and many others to see that the 
unintended consequences of a 
prohibition low were for worse 
than those of the prohibited 
substance. Repeal of the 18th 
Amendment followed when 
concerned mothers - initially led 
by Republican women in 1928 
realized that children had easier 
access to alcohol and were us· 
ing it at a shocking rate even as

the drug war. Funds that should

to fight the war, while schools 
literally crumble around the

Overt racial discrimination is 
not tolerated in any public or pri-
vote business. But it hos gone out 
of control in the criminol jus1ice 
system and been sustained by the 
attitude of the drug war. The war 
against crock cocaine has led Af-
rican Americans to support the 
incarceration of their own. Fear 
is the driving force in this pora-
digm. Fear that has been instilled 
by government propaganda, 
heightened by questionably 
motivated private interests, 
such as the Partnership for a 
Drug Free America & Private 
Prison Industry. 

We often hear that the US 
has five to ten times the rate of 
incarceration of any European 
notion . We don't hear as much 
about the fad that it has been 
so totally unbalanced from a ra-
cial point of view. While the rate 
of imprisonment of whites is 
about two times that of other 
nations, it is more than ten times 
greater for blacks in most states. 
81acks get longer sentences 
than whites, on average, for the 
some crimes. These numbers 
are new in the last several years, 
and it is stridly drug arrests that 
have created them.

THE SLIPPERY SLOPE OF 
DRUG WAR MILITARIZATION 

by Kevin B. leese, President, Common Sense for Drug Policy 
It wasn't long ago that it was 

a criminal offense, a violation of 
the Posse Comitatus Ad, for ac-
tive duty military troops to be 
engaged in domestic low en-
forcement. In fad, that was the 
rule for most of the history of the 
United States. A series of drug 
war amendments to Posse Comi· 
tatus during the 1980s under 
Presidents Reagan and Bush, has 
changed that and placed Marines 
on potrol at home. 

A team of low ranking Mo· 
rines, led by a Corporal, were 
on drug war potrol in Redford, 
Texas, on May 20. On that day 
a fatal shot was fired by Corpo· 
ral Banuelos and a young US 
citizen, Esequiel HZeke" Her-
nandez, Jr. was dead . Zeke was 
herding his goats, carrying an 

old single shot .22-caliber rifle 
passed down to him from his 
grandfather. The Marines claim 
the high school sophomore 
fired two shots in their direction . 
They followed him for 20 min-
utes, then, they claim he raised 
his rifle again and the fatal shot 
was fired from on M16 . The 
autopsy showed Zeke wasn 't 
facing Corporal Banuelos when 
he was killed. Zeke loy on the 
ground unattended for 20 min-
utes and bled to death . 

Redford citizens soy they felt 
invaded, treated as if they were 
the Enemy and had one of their 
best and brightest taken from 
them. A grand jury was con-
vened, but this made the injus-
tice worse. The grand jury was 
at best a mockery. It included 

the Assistant Sector Chief of the 
Border Patrol who was port of the 
administration that asked the Ma-
rines to come to the border and 
one of the people responsible for 
their supervision. It also included 
the wife of a Border Patrol officer, 
a Border Patrol retiree, and two 
Customs Officers. The judge 
found no conflid of interest and 
Distrid Attorney Valadez said it 
was good to have people on the 
jury who "knew how to get things 
done." The DA did not seek on 
indidment, he just presented the 
evidence. Unfortunately, that did 
not include the Redford residents 
who heard the single shot from 
the Marines, not the multiple

Marijuana is medicine. It has 

been used for thousands of years 
to treat a wide variety of a ilments. 
Marijuana wa;"legal in the United 
States and prominent in the phar-
macopoeia until 1937 , when pos-
session and use of marijuano was 
outlawed by the federal govern-
ment. Today , eight patients re-
ceive marijuana legally from the 

government; for all other Ameri-
cans who could benefit from its 
therapeutic value, it re mains a 
fo rbidden medicine. 

Contra ry to popular be lief, 
there have been hund reds of 
studies on the medica l uses of 
ca nnabis since its introduction to 
western medicine in the mid-
nineteenth century. 

The best established medical 
use of smoked marijua na is as

Industrial Hemp: Marijuana's 
Much-Maligned Cousin 

Traditional jurisprudence 
frowns on guilt by association -
unless the defendant is a plant 
called industria l hemp and the 
prosecutor is the Federal Drug 
Enforcement Administration . 
Recently a coalition of formers , 
environmentalists and busi-
nesses petitioned the DEA and 
the Department of Ag riculture to 
stop treating th is plant as a 
criminal just because it is related 
to marijuana, a controlled sub-
stance. Otherwise, America 's 
formers and entrepreneurs will 
be at a disadvantage as other 
industrial democracies try to ex-
ploit hemp's commercial poten-
tial and environmental benefits. 

The revival of interest in in-
dustrial hemp, which has I per-
cent or less of the delta-9 
tetrahydrocannabinol, called 
THC, that g ives marijuana its 
psychoadive effed, flows from 
the versatil ity of its seed and 
fiber. The seed can be con-
verted into food oil , animal feed , 
points and cosmeti~ . The fiber 
can be turned into textile, rope, 
carpets, paper produds and 
construction materials. In at 
least 10 states, formers also 
wont to assess its value as a 
rotation crop that is pest- and 
disease- resistant. Ford re-
searchers abroad are studying it 

a s a lightweight material for ra-
d iator gri lles and other auto 
ports. Neither the DEA nor 
Barry McCaffrey, the President's 
drug policy adviser, find this per-
suasive. Legalizing hemp, his 
office soys - removing it from the 
DEA's controlled-substance list -
would confuse everyone, espe-
cially eighth graders, whose 
marijuana use has tripled in the 
lost five years. Hemp, it warns, 
would provide camouflage for 
growing marijuana. But hemp 
and marijuana do not cohabit 
well . Hemp, grown mostly for its 
fibrous stalk, is planted in dense 
stands. Marijuana is not, since 
drug traffickers wont a bush with 
leaves rich in THC, which added 
sunlight helps provide. 

To ease low enforcement's 
fears, proponents have offered 
a compromise. The agency 
would revise its rules to legalize 
hemp but award jurisdiction to 
the Agriculture Deportment. 
Agriculture would distribute cer-
tified seed with a THC level of 1 
percent or less to formers it li -
censed; it would inspect fields 
too. The marketplace, not my-
opic rules, should determine 
hemp's future in America . 

1980s, smoked marijuana was 
shown to be on effedive anti -
e metic in six different state-
sponsored cl inical studies 
involving nearly 1,000 patients. 
For the majority of these pa-
tients, smoked marijuana 
proved more effedive than both 
co nventional prescription anti-
nouseants and oral THC (mar-
keted today a s the synthetic pill , 
Marinol. 

In addition to its usefulness a s 
o n anti-emetic, there exists evi-
de nce - bC'th scientific and an-
ecdotal - that marijuana is a 
valuable a id in reducing pain 
a nd suffe ring for patients with a 
variety of other serious ailments, 
and that it is less toxic and costly 
than the conventional medicines 
fo r which it may be substituted . 
For example, marijuana allevi-
ates the nausea, vomiting , and 
the loss of appetite caused by 
the AIDS wasting syndrome and 
by treatment with AZT and other 
drugs without accelerating the 
rate at which HIV positive indi-
viduals develop clinical AIDS or 
other illnesses. 

It is generally accepted - by 
the National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS) and others - that marijuana 
reduces intraocular pressure (lOP) 
in patients suffering from glau-
coma, the leading couse of blind-
ness in the United States. 

There also exists historical 
evidence that marijuana is ef-
fedive in treating a variety of 
spastic conditions such as multi-
ple sclerosis, paraplegia, epi-
lepsy, and quadriplegia . In the 
book, Marijuana: The Forbidden 
Medicine, Dr. Lester Grinspaon 
of Harvard Medical School de-
scribes several case histories of 
potients suffering from multiple 
sclerosis and other disorders 
whose condition improved while 
they smoked marijuana and de-
teriorated after they stopped 
smoking. . 

Evidence in support of mari-
juana's medical value has ex-
isted for centuries and has been 
validated by numerous studies,

Marijuana Policy Project Calls For Activism 

Marijuana arrests reached on 
all-time record number in 1997, 
according to FBI data. In on 
analysis provided by the Wash-
ington-based Marijuana Policy 
Project, researchers noted that of 
the 695,201 arrests for mari-
juana, 87.2% _re for posses-
sion, nat sole or manufacture. 
The number of morijuana arrests 
was almost as high as the number 
of arrests for murder, rape and 
aggravated assault combined. 

"This is a tremendous waste 
of criminal justice resources,· 
said Chuck Thomas, Diredor of 
Communications at The Mari-
juana Policy Project (MPP) . 
"Marijuana prohibition creates 
dangerous criminal markets 
and tokes police resources away 
from violent crime.· 

MPP is a harm-redudion ad-
vocacy organization, which fo-
cuses on reducing the harms 
caused by the prohibition on 
marijuana . In 1997 MPP dis-
rupted a Nationul Institutes of 
Health medicinal marijuana

helped organize several pro-

of Congress who adively op-

Drug War Public Policy Disaster 
by Wendy Kaminer, public policy fellow at RadcliHe College, 

from, All Things Considered, NPR 
A recent study by Columbia 

University confirms what many 
criminologists have long known: 
alcohol is associated with much 
more violent crime than any il-
legal drug. Twenty-one percent 
of violent felons in state prisons 
committed their crimes while 
under the influence of alcohol 
alone. Only 3 percent were 
high on cocaine and only 1 per-
cent were using heroin. 

Violent crimes linked to alco-
hol use include murder, rape, and 

domestic abuse. We might odd 
ta this list drunk driving, which 
wauld nat hove been covered by 
the Columbia study of prison in-
mates since it doesn't often re-
suh in incarceration. 

A sensible person reviewing 
these findings might wander why 
_ criminolize the use of cocaine 
and heroin, nat to mention mari-
juana, while _ tolerate and even 
celebrate alcohol consumption. 

Of course, _ leamed long

EDITORIAL 
It seems that every society targets its prejudices and hostilities 

at defenseless minorities rather than face up to the root causes 
of its economic problems and social injustices. At various times 
over the past sixty years, our country has oppressed African-
Americans, Jews, Japanese, Americon Indians and gays. 

Today, draconian laws enforced in the name of the "War on 
Drugs" target both medical and recreational users of marijuana 
as well as users of hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. 

Anyone that doubts our society is making scapegoots of users 
of some drugs while condoning others, such as alcohol and 
cigarettes that are arguably more dangerous, should read 
"Drug Warriors & Their Prey; From Police Power To Police State" 
by Richard Lawrence Miller (Praeger-1996) . 

Miller first authored a book about our notion's policy on drugs 
and later a book concerning the Nazi judiciol system during the 
19305 and 19405. He was struck by certain disturbing similarities, 
which he writes about in "Drug Warriors & Their Prey." 

Miller starts by describing "The chain of destrudion" which 
progresses from simple identification, to ostracism, to confisca-
tion, to concentration, and eventually, to annihilation. He then 
devotes a chapter to each link to show how our misguided 
national drug policy is already causing atrocities similar to those 
perpetrated under Nazism. 

Sounds far-fetched' 
We invite you to peruse "Drug War FactsW in this issue, then 

read either "Smoke and MirrorsW by Dan Boum, a former Wall 
Sfreef Journal reporter, or "Drug Crazy" by Mike Gray, writer of 
the screenplay for "The China Syndrome." These readings 
provide the factual background for a more meaningful reading

was baund to fail, so a sensible 
person might propose that we 
end the prohibition of drugs like 
cocaine and heroin thot pose 
much less threat to the public 
safety thon alcohol. But sensi-
ble people hove hod little influ-
ence on the notion's drug 
policies. 

The war on drugs has been 
one of the biggest public palicy 
disosters of thelast 25 years. It 
has not reduced drug use. It has 
instead increased violent crime 
attendant on illegal drug traf-
ficking, just as prohibition of al-
cohol increased criminal adivity 
some 70 years ago. 

The war on drugs has greatly 
exacerbated the problem of gun 
violence. The illegal drug trade 
not only creates violence, it pays 
for bigger and better guns. The 
war on drugs has helped finance 
the arms race in the streets. 

It has also created a crisis in 
prison overcrowding. Peaple are 
sent to state and federal prison for 
long terms, five to 20 years, for 
nonviolent, low-level drug of-
fenses. Providing them with in-
prison drug treatment programs 
may be helpful, but it obscures the 
fact that many drug users should 
not be in prison at all . 

The nation's drug laws hove 
tumed many ordinary, relatively 
harmless citizens with ordinary 
bad habits into convicted felons. 
What jobs will they find when 
they' re released? What will they 
contribute to their families or 
communities' If we imprison 
people to protect society, we 
have to ask what society gains in 
the end from their imprison-
ment. We don't ask questions 
like this abaut the drug war. 

It has been billed as on anti -
crime measure, but in fad the 
war on drugs is on anti-vice cru-
sade. That's why its failure has 
not sparked popular protests or 
a rational evaluation of its bene-
fits and costs. It is driven by 
moral fervor, not pragmatism or 
reason. Listening to bureau-
crats and paliticians boost abaut 
the drug war, you have to won-
der what they're smoking .

the things they otherwise will

they must not touch, and hove

erately have set these traps 
to destroy them. 

While people CD'1 see that pr0hi-
bition has made drug dealing ever 
more lucrative, they won't con-
sider any alternative. It is obvious 
ta many of us that the drug war 

. is the root cause of violent 
gongs that terrorize inner city 
residents. In my neighbor-
hood in my youth, there were 
drugs and dealers, but they did 
not use guns in their business. 
Unleashing police to do war on 
Americans initiated the vio-
lence, causing dealers to begin 
to arm themselves and become 
increasingly violent against the 
cops and everyone else. 

that blocks do not use drugs 
any more than whites do and 
whites are not arrested as fre-
quently or punished as se-
verely as minorities . 

Too many people value se-
curity more than privacy or 
freedom. The image of violent 
young minority males has ex-
acerbated racism and interra-
cial distrust. The drug war has 
pitted individuals against one-
another. Through our drug 
control strategies we have 
taught an entire generation to 
be abusive and disrespectful of 
the rights of others I 

The thinking that infliction 
of pain is the best way to 
teach people has seeped into 
the values of our society. The 
culture of punishment has de-
veloped with and sustains the 
drug war.

generation, the American un-
culturated, displaced persons 
who are simply trying to survive in 
our cities the only ways they hove 
learned to do so. These ways are 
contrary ta the avenues to success 
in the mainstream. 

The drug civil war has little to 
do with drugs. It is about con-
trolling human beings - physi-
cally and morally. It has twisted 
values and beliefs. 

The saddest thing about the 
war on drugs is that most mi-
norities support it. The disas-
ter of the drug war blurs the 
effects of the drugs. Through 
the eyes of fear, people don ' t 
see is that the problems asso-
ciated with drug use are mode 
worse by the mentality of the 
drug war. Because of the in-
sidious nature of the war on 
drugs, inner city people tend to 
cling to it as their only hope, 
while it is adually this century's 
instrument of their destrudion .

Drug Reform Makes Major Gains - Top. News Stories of 1998 
1. Medical Marlluana Ac-

• Medical marijuana initia-

tives in Arizona, Washington" 
Oregon and Alaska passed in 
November of 1998. This fol-
lows California's stunning vic-
tory two years earlier. 

• Voters in the District of Co-
lumbia are engaged in a legal 
battle to have the results of their 
medical marijuana initiative 
certified by the Board of Elec-
tions. Congress used its pawer 
over the District's budget to pre-
vent the municipality from allo-
cating any funds to certify lows 
which would reduce penalties 
for marijuana use or passession. 
Exit polls conducted on election 
day in Washington, DC indicate 
that the initiative enjoyed sup-
part from 69% of the voters. 

• Voters in Colorado are also 
engaged in a lawsuit with their 
state government over the lost 
minute refusal to allow a vote on 
their medical marijuana initia-
tive. The controversy surrounds 
the number of valid signatures 
gathered for the initiative. It is 
expected that Colorado will 

have the measure on the ballot 
in the year 2000. 

2. Needle Exchange Advo-

• Secretary of Health and 
Human Services Donna Shalala 
endorsed needle exchange as 
on effective way to reduce the 
spread of HIV/AIDS without in-
creasing drug use, but buckled 
to palitical oppasition to lifting 
the federal funding ban. 

• Drug Czar Retired General 
Barry McCaffrey's active oppasi-

publicly e)(posed in The Wash-

condemn McCaffrey's leader-

Hope for AIIIerlca's 
Drug War Prisoners 

Are America's drug laws more 
culprit than those they ensnare? 
The November Coalition beUeves 

they are. 
by Nora Callohan, Director, The November Coalition 

The November Coolition was founded to give drug-war prison-
ers and their loved ones a vOice in the call for drug policy reform. 

Through notional drug prohibition, our government wages 
war on the afflicted and targets citizens who lack economic and 
educational opportunities. They are the scapegoats of our time. 

While we slept, proponents of prohibition, abetted by postur-
ing paliticians, pushed their .misguided, mean-spirited agenda 
forward, and today the USA is the world's leading jailer. 

Hundreds of thousands are imprisoned for non-violent drug 
prohibition-related crimes and millions of citizens have a loved 
one incarcerated for non-violent drug low violations. 

One November Coalition goal is to lift the sense of shame 
that many families and friends of the drug war prisoner experi-
ence. Their loved one has been ensnared by bod lows, and 
isolated in jails and prisons mainly because of senseless drug 
prohibition lows that tempt and corrupt our society. 

Hopefully these families will find their voices and soon the 
notion will come to feel their pain as it come to feel the pain of 
those who lost family members and friends on Vietnam, another 
misbegotten war. 

Criminalizing whole segments of society is not a practice we 
should support. Allowing a prison industrial complex to flourish 
unchecked in a free society compromises the democracy we cherish. 

The November Coalition publishes a bi-monthly newspaper, 
The Rozar Wire. Annual membership includes a subscription and 
the oppartunity to support America's drug-war prisoners. (509)

Asset Forfeiture Distorts 
Governmental Policy 

Making and 
Law Enforcement 

Civil forfeiture laws allow p0-
lice to confiscate private property 
without having to pay for it, and 
without even having to arrest any-
one, much less pnMI the property 
owner guilty of any crime. Eighty 
percent of all forfeiture victims are 
never charged with a crime. While 
in a criminal trial, a defendant is 
innocent until proven guilty, forfei-
ture defendants must prove their 
property's innocence to reclaim 
their property. Furthermore, un-
like in a criminal trial, civil forfei-
ture victims are not entitled to 
court-appointed attorneys. 

According to a 1998 article 
published in the University of 
Chicago Low Review, the ability 
of law enforcement agencies to 
financially benefit from forfeited 
assets, and the provision of 
large block grants from Con-
gress to fight the drug trade 
"have distorted governmental 
policy making and low enforce-

ment.· The authors stated that 
"the law enforcement agenda 
that targets assets rather than 
crime, the 80 percent of seizures 
that are unaccompanied by any 
criminal prosecution, the plea 
bargains that favor drug king-
pins and penalize the 'mules' 
without assets to trade, the re-
verse stings that target drug 
buyers rather than drug sellers, 
the overkill in agencies involved 
in even minor arrests, the mas-
sive shift in resources towards 
federal jurisdiction over local 
law enforcement - is largely the 
unplanned by-product of this 
economic incentive structure." 

FEAR (Forfeiture Endangers 
American Rights) advocates 
criminal due process safeguards 
for all forfeitures, and enhanced 
protections for innocent owners 
and third porties.

What History 
Teaches Us About 
Drug Prohibition 
adult user respect for the law 
hod plummeted; the criminal 
justice system became swamped; 
violent crime and corruption 
exploded; petty thugs re-
ceived a bonanza which 
spawned today' s powerful 
criminal organizations. Prohi-
bition was repealed, but her-
oin and cocaine prohibition 
remained as a criminal enter-
prise which also provided em-
ployment for the bureaucracy 
set up to enforce Prohibition . 
Over time, and with a hiatus 
for the Second World War, 
the son of Prohibition grew 
larger than the father - his-
tory has been allowed to re-
peat itself with a vengeance. 

This brief history suggests 
there are many lessons to be 
learned from careful analysis of 
the post. A commonly ex-
pressed fear is that change in 
drug policy will produce a "na-
tion of zombies.· History tells us 
that there is a real difference 
between drug use and addic-
tion, and that a natural human 
abhorrence of addiction insu-
lates most of us from that dan-
ger. There is alsa strong 
evidence that those who, for 
whatever reasans, are prane to 
addiction are not deterred by 
force any more than a potential 
suicide might be. 

h's clear that our current di-
vision of drugs into legal and 
illegal is arbitrary and no more 
contributes to solving drug 
problems than making all Fords 
illegal would solve traffic prob-
lems (in that analogy, mari-
juana might be a tricycle). 
Through the insight of observers 
like Vollmer along with the ex-
perience of Prohibition, and 
models ranging from heroin 
maintenance in Shreveport in 
the 1920s to modem experience 
in Switzerland and Holland, we 
have strong indications that 
much less damage might be 
done to a society willing to reach 
on accommodation with mari-
juana and to allow "hard" drug 
addicts to get their drugs from 
doctors instead of criminals. 

• The U.N. Drug Summit 
sparked a Global Day of Pratest 
in 53 cities around the world. 
New York, London, Amsterdam, 
and Telaviv are just a few of the 
cities in which pratest events 
were held.

shots that the Marines claim oc-
curred. 

Between the time of the fatal 
shooting and the no-bill by the 
grand jury the Department of 
Defense reacted strongly. They 
were upset that their soldiers 
would be subjected to criminal 
prosecution for doing their duty. 
On July 30, the first day of the 
grand jury, 000 spokesperson 
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Scott Campbell 
told USA Today this was "not fair 
to the members of our armed 
forces." 

As a result Defense Secretary 
William Cohen reportedly will 
ask the border states to sign 
agreements to provide immunity 
to local criminal laws, just as we 
have ·status of forces agree-
ments" with foreign govern-
ments. This is protection that 
police officers in the United 
States do not have. 

In fact, the reaction should 
have been an apology for the 
tragic Incident and a change in 
pal icy. Secretary Cohen should 
have said it was a shame Zeke 
had to die in order for us to be 
reminded that military enforce-
ment of civilian law is wrong. Our 
soldiers are not trained to make 
arrests, Mirandize and bring to 
justice; they are trained to kill. 

Continued from page 1 

The people of Redford are re-
acting with strength and forbear-
ance. They have gone back to 
their history books and re-read 
the Declaration Of Inde-
pendence. Two of our grievances 
ogainst King George were for 
using the British Army against us 
and "protecting them, by mock 
trial, from punishment for any 
murders which they should com-
mit. ' ... They see the refusal to 
indict as the beginning of the 
battle against militarization, not 
the end. 

The death of Zeke must be re-
membered. Militarization of the 
Drug War must be stopped. If we 
do not oct in his memory the slip-
pery slope of militarization will 
pick up speed. We have come a 
long way in less than two decades, 
from prohibition of military in-
volvement to discussions of immu-
nity for fatal shootings. If we do not 
toke action now, Zeke's death will 
become on excuse for greater 
militarization, nat less.

CRIME 
• A recent study by Columbia 

University confirms what many 
criminologists have long known: 
alcohol is associated with more 
violent crime than any illegal 
drug, including crock, cocaine, 
and heroin. Twenty-one per-
cent of violent felons in state 
prisot;ls committed their crimes 
while under the influence of al-
cohol alone. Only 3% were high 
on crock or powder cocaine 
alone and only 1 % were using 
heroin alone.

DRUG TESTING 
• Companies which use Foe-

tor 1000, on impairment testing 
system, are finding that drug 
and alcohol use are not the most 
common reasons for failure; 
rather, severe fatigue and illness 
are more common. 

Sown: Hamilton,"A Vid.o Gome That 
T.lls if Employees Are Fit To Work. " 8usi-

• A positive drug test does not 
indicate whether an employee 
Was impaired or intoxicated on 
the job, nor does it indicate 
whether on employee has a drug 
problem or how often the em-
ployee uses the drug. Thus most 
tests do not provide information 
relevant to job performance.

the cost. One electronics manu-

found 49 positive results. A con-

o In order to comply with 

United States' demands to stop 
coco production, Colombia uses 
aerial spraying to drop herbi-
cides on illicit crops. Since these 
crops are the peasants' only 
source of income they move into 
the Amazon rainforest and form 
on steep hillsides. This constant 
push on peasants has led to the 
clearing of over 1.75 million 
acres of rainforest.

HEMP 
o ~ccording to David West, 

Ph .D. , "The THC levels in indus-
trial hemp are so low that no one 
could ever get high from smok-
ing it. Moreover, hemp contains 
a relatively high percentage of 
another cannabinoid, CBD, that 
actually blocks the marijuana 
high . Hemp, it turns out, is not 
only not marijuana; it could be 
called 'antimarijuana.'''

o Although opponents of 
hemp production claim that 
hemp fields will be used to hide 
marijuana fields, this is unlikely 
because cross-pollination be-
tw_n hemp and marijuana 
plants would significantly re-
duce the potency of the mari-
juana plant. On March 12, 
1998, Canada legalized hemp

"Marihuana's relative potential 
for harm to the vast majority of 
individual users and its actual 
impact on society does not justify 
a social policy designed to seek

use it. This judgment is based on

corrected him, pointing out that 
among other foctors, in Canada 
needles can be purchased le-
gally while they could only be 
purchased with prescriptions 
where the USA studies took 
place. Therefore, ·unlike in the 
USA studies, the populations in 
the Canadian studies were less 
likely to include the more afflu-
ent and better fundioning ad-
dicts who could purchase their 
own needles and who were less 
likely to engage in the riskiest 
activities. Thus, it was not sur-
prising that participonts in the 
study hod higher rates of HIV 
than those who did not - they 
were in different risk categories.

ComMon Sense For Drug Policy PAID SUPPUMINT Page' 

Chapter One, "Drug Crazy" 
Goff is edgy about all the kltls 

on the street. There are civilians 
all over the place and old folks 
on the porches even though it's 
been done for hours. The tem-
perature's barely into the 50s, 
but on the heels of a brutal win-
ter in Chicago, any wind that's 
not from the north is on ice-
breaker. 

Detective Frank Goff is in the 
back seat of a blue CheYy Sub-
urban across from an aging 
brick six-flat on 113th Street. 
This is a lower-middle-closs 
block neighborhood, mostly 
homeowners trying to keep their 
places up and not succeeding. 
The building Goff and his crew 
are watching is just a couple of 
blocks off State Street, "that 
Great Street/ but when you get 
this far south - and this late in 
the 20th Century - it loses any 
resemblance to the boulevard of 
song and fable. 

The von's windows are heav-
ily tinted, but to be on the safe 
side Goff has added burlap cur-
tains. He can still see through 
the mesh, but from the outside, 
the heavy cloth will shade any 
occidental kick of light from me-
tallic objects. Scotty Freemon is 
at the wheel, and he's block, but 
Goff is staying out of sight. A 
white boy would look quite out 
of place around here. The two 
other guys on the crew, Fisher 
and Washington, are across the 
street in the vestibule of the six-
flat . They' re wait;ng for a coke 
dealer named Ramone. 

It's been a long day. They 
started this morning cramped up 
in this same von, watching crock 
deals go down near a grammar 
school way out on the West Side. 
And that's what lead them here. 
This elite team is with the school 
unit of the Chicago Police De-
partment. It's Goff's job to make 
some kind of dent, however 
small, in the gong and narcotics 
activity that is devouring the 
city's school system. "To stop 
guns and narcotics around the 
school. That's our specific as-
signment. To get the drive-by 
shooters, to get the narcotics 
away from the schools. " 

Their target this morning was 
on area known as HK_TownH 
about fifteen miles northwest of 
here. Goff hod been tipped that 
the area around the Marconi 
Grammar School was flooded 
with crock. He decided to drive 
a wedge in this operation. He 
got his team in position around 
8 :00 a .m. and what they sow 
over the next few hours would 
have left the overage Chicagoon 
bug-eyed. But none of 't was 
news to Goff. He sees this all the 
time. A cor pulls up, a couple of 
guys get out, eoch one with a 
dozen -Sixty-packs- - sixty little 
vials of crack, about a fifth of a 
gram in each. TheM guys are the 
wholesalers. They round up their 
street dealers and front each 
one a single 60-pack_ In about 
ten or fifteen minutes, the street 
dealer will sellout his supply at 
ten bucb a pop. He keeps $1 00, 
turns the other $500 over to the 
wholesaler, and gets another 
60-pack. If you hustle at this 
game, you can be the richest kid 
on the block . .. 

These street dealers, of 
course, are all quite young. They 
hove ta be. In Illinois it's a Class 
X felony to sell drugs within 
1000 yards of a school, a pane 
or a church - which covers most 
of the city - and that carries a 
mandatory 6- to 60-year sen-
tence. But the maximum you can 
give a juvenile is 30 days in the 
Audy Home. Common sense 
dictates that the dealers would 
use these youngsters on the 
street and keep the aduhs out of 
sight. The youngest kid Goff 
spotted this morning looked to

be about 11 . He was not a full 
fledged deoler, he would just 
toke over when one of the older 
boys went to take a piss or some-
thing. His main job was lookout. 
They paid him $50 a day ta ride 
his bike up and down the street 
watching for the -Five-Ohl- (as 
in Hawaii FiYe-Oh). 

As for the buyers in this open-
air drug market, some of them 

up. These guys split and a few 
minutes later another cor 
dropped off the next round of 
60-pocks. "They always keep it 
separate,- says Goff. "The drugs 
and the money are never to-

glance. Cops and robbers alike 
soy Frank Goff is a man of his 
word. He also reads the street 
betterthan most. "A lot ofthese 
guys that are users, they ain 't 
bod guys. We see a lot of wone-
ing guys, truck drivers and 
everything, people with jobs. 
They're not robbing people to 
buy this $10 bag. Why arrest all 
these people' You know, they 

The only contract you have to do business on 
this street corner - a business that may be 

worth $20,000 a day - is the enforcer you've 
got stuck in your belt. And when the competi-

stripped away and the neighborhood is trans-

formed into Dodge City, ca. 1850. 

were quite young as well. The 
youngest was probably in the 
fifth grode, but they weren't all 
schoolchildren. The oldest was 
in his 70s. There was a mailman, 
a crA bus driver - they were 
white, block, Sponish, you nome 
it. At one point Goff spotted a 
pregnant white lady carrying a 
baby in a papoose sling with a 
gallon of milk in one hand walk-
ing down the street. Goff said, 
"What the hell is she doing 
here'· She baught a $10 hit. 

The impact of this kind of ac-
tivity on on otherwise peoceful 
neighborhood is beyond belief. 
When the dealers move in, the 
most significant change, of 
course, is the guns. To proted 
their interests, the dealers bring 
with them a considerable 
amount of firepower and they 
like to flash it so that everybody 
understands they' re not kidding . 
Dealing in contraband is on in-
herently dangerous business. 
There are mountains of loose 
cosh all over the place and if 
somebody sticks you up, you 
hove to deal with it yourself be-
cause you sure as hell can't call 
the cops. Along with the con-
stant threat of bandits, there is 
the constant bottle over the mar-
keting fronchise. The only con-
trod you have to do business on 
this street comer - a business 
that may be worth $20,000 a 
day - is the enforcer you've got 
stuck in your belt. And when the 
competition shows up, a century 
of civilization is stripped away 
C'nd the neighborhood is trans-
formed into Dodge City, 
co.1850. The toughest sono-
fabitch on main street runs the 
show and the good citizens keep 
their mouths shut. Imagine half 
a dozen teenagers in Chicago 
Bulls starter jackets with their 
cops on backwards and auto-
matics stuff.d in their pants 
transacting business in your 
df'io4way. You don't see a thing. 
And that's what impressed Goff 
this morning as he watched from 
the van. Here were ordinary 
folks, working stiffs, trying to 
k .. p up the neighborhood, 
sweeping sidewalks, washing 
cars, never making eye-contad 
with the dealers. The dealers 
might as well hove been invis-
ible. 

A few hours ofter the top gun 
dropped off the first shipment, 
he come back to pick up the cosh 
receipts and replenish inventory. 
Fram the bock seat, two guys 
stepped out with guns at the 
ready just like Brinks guards, 
and scanned the street while the 
money was counted, bogged, 
and sealed. Apparently it tallied 

Goff and his team hod seen 
enough to bust practically every-
body in sight. He gave a shout 
over the radio and squad cars 
came screaming in from every 
angle, guys jumping out, guns 
all over the place, people run-
ning, handcuffs, faces on the 
pavement, everybody on both 
sides swearing Motherfucker-
this and Motherfucker-that. 
They hauled ten kids off to the 
lockup, confiscated five auto-
matics and a couple of Chinese 
AK-47s. And they shut down the 
operation, at least for the rest of 
the day. But Goff hod no illu-
sions that he'd mode any per-
manent alteration here. "You 
know you ain 't gonna stop it," 
he says. -It's a game." 

got a problem. So instead of just 
getting this kid selling a bog or 
two or this guy who buys a bog 
or two - we work our way up 
the chain: As soon as the dust 
settled, it took Goff about five 
minutes of threats and promises 
to find out where all this rock 
was coming from. The locals fin-
gered "Ramone," a Gangster 
Disciple and known dealer 
who's address on 113th Street 
come up on the computer. Goff 
and his team headed for the 
South Side. 

By sundown, Scotty Freemon 
and Darren Washington, the 
two African-American half-
backs on Goff's squad , are wait-
ing in the darkened corridor of 
Ramone's apartment building as 

Donald 
Scott 

Killed in 'his home 
by anti-drug task 

force. Motive: "Asset 
Forfeiture" 

Donald Scott was age 62 at 
his time of death at his Malibu, 
CA home on Odober 2, 1992 . 

He and his wife, Frances 
Plante, were awakened early 

that morning by a loud pounding at the front door of their home. 
As Plante tried to open the door, a narcotics task force from the 
LA County Sheriff's Deportment burst into their ranch home, 
weopons looded and in hand. 

Plante was pushed forcefully from the door at gun paint. She 
cried out, -Don't shoot me, don 't kill mel- With a gun aimed at 
her heod, she sow her husband charge into the room, waving a 
revolver above his head . She heard a deputy shout, - Put the gun 
downl Put the gun down I Put the gun downl- As Donald lowered 
his gun, she heord three shots ring out, apparently from two 
sources. 

Her husband was killed instantly. Scott was a millionaire who 
owned 250 acres of breathto~ingly beautiful ranch land adjacent 
ta federal pane lands. Efforts hod been made by the feds to buy 
the properly, but he was not interested in selling. Claims that 
there might be pot growing on the lan~, made by government 
agents who did aerial s:.Jrveillance, were used to get a search 
warrant. 

An official inquiry by Ventu.ro County DA Michael Bradbury 
suggested that agents were hoping this raid would leod to asset 
forfeiture of the land Scott would not sell. His report indicated 
that seizing the property was a major mativating foctor in the 
raid which led to the murder of Donald Scott. 

No marijuana was found in their home or grounds. Scott did 
not even smoke it. 

It's a game, however, he can 
ploy with deadly skill . Unflappa-
ble, quick-witted and creative, 
Goff has all the essential ingre-
dients of an undercover cop. 
Now in his mid-forties with over 
twenty years on the force, his 
close-cropped groying hair and 
trim salt-and-pepper beard 
frome the kind of small town 
good looks people trust at first 

he comes in. When the hands 
reoch out to grab him, he; as-
sumes he's a deod man. It seems 
that his little operation up in K-
Town is a private sideline not 
sondioned by the Gongster Dis-
ciples. Ramone thinks he's 
about to get whacked. He's so 
relieved when they soy "P~licel " 
he practically kisses them. 

On the other hand, he has 
half-a-pound of rock cocaine in 
his pocket and a pair of Tech-9 
assault weapons in his apart-
ment. And since they've already 
checked his rap sheet, they know 
he has a major case pending. So 
in the time i. tokes to flip a coin, 
Ramone decides to become a 
C.1. - Confidential Informant -
in return for a little slack. With 
Goff listening in, Ramone calls 
his supplier - "De-De" - and 
asks him to come by with an-
other kilo. Then Goff and his 
men toke up positions in the ves-
tibule and in the von across the 
street. They're expecting De-De 
any minute now. 

Over the post decode, Goff 
says, he's seen a sea change in 
the drug war in Chicago. "Ten 
years ago, if you stopped a dope 
dealer and he hod $2000 on 
him, that was a big deal. Today 
you can find that much in some 
kid's lunch bucket. And that's 
another thing that's changing. 
Before it was men . And they 
were mostly dealing reefer. 
Now, that's one of the hardest 
things to find is reefer. There's a 
big upsurge in heroin. Acid is 
back. Crock is all over the place. 
I absolutely guarantee that I 
could go onywhere in the city 
and buy dope within three or 
four blocks. Very easily done. 
For instonce, there's place a 
block from the station house . 
This one operation maybe does 
fifteen o~ twenty thousand a 
week ... 

Headlights sweep the street 
as 0 cor turns onto 113th at the 
corner. Through the burlap, Goff 
watches as the guy porks in the 
spot they've saved for him in 
front of Ramone's six-flat. 
"That's the wrong cor," says 
Freemon. De-De's supposed to 
be in a Dodge Shadow. This is a 
Ford . Freemon and Goff get out 
and approach the driver cau-
tiously. They don't wont to score 
him '0 death . They flash their 
badges and politely a sk him to 
move on . The startled citizen is 
gone in a flash. They get bock in 
the von and wait. 

A few minutes later, Bob Fis-
cher comes out of the building. 
Goff crocks the window. Fischer 
says Ramone just got a call from 
De-De. "He wonts Ramone to 
come down and pick the stuff up 
because he's having problems 
with his starter. He can't shut the 
cor off." Just then another cor 
turns onto the street. Fischer 
jumps in back of the von with 
Goff to get out of sight. They 
watch the cor roll up to them and 
pull into the open slot in front of 
Ramone's building. 

HBlue Hondo,· says Freemon. 
Still the wrong cor. They get out 
again . Goff crosses the street 
and "",ves up the sidewalk as 
Freemon and Fischer approoch 
on the driver's side. No sudden 
moves. They don't wont some 
poor taxpayer jumping out of his 
skin. The guy is half out the door 
when he spats them. He's got 
what looks like a pizzo in a plas-
tic bag in one hand and a sock 
of flour in the other. Goff says, 
"Sir, we're police officers, would 
you mind--

BRRRRRRRUPI He's cut off by 
25 rounds from the machine 
gun inside the plastic bog . Goff 
is hit in the neck. Scotty Freemon 
is down. Fischer, narrowly 
missed, blasts away with his 
weapon as De-De jumps bock in 
and jams the Hondo in gear. 
Goff, bleeding at the neck, emp-
ties his Borette at the fleeing cor. 

Fronk Goff has this recurring 
nightmare - he knows a lot of 
cops who have this dream -
where he's firing and firing and 
nothing's happening. The bul-

lets are just falling aut of the gun 
barrel. Now he's living the 
nightmare. He can see the win-
dows shattering, but these soft-
point police bullets flatten an 
impod to prevent a ricochet. 
They're penetrating the glass 
but without enough farce to do 
any damage to the driver. De-
De, an the other hand, is using 
armor piercing ammo. The 
round that grazed Goff's neck 
also went through bath sides of 
a car half a black down the 
street. But while Goff' s bullets 
aren 't drawing blood, they still 
hit like a sledgehammer, and 
De-De is stunned. The wind-
shield is so riddled he can't see 
out of it and he's bouncing off 
cars on both sides of the street. 
Goff jams in another clip and 
takes off after him an foot as the 
other guys look after Scotty 
Freeman. 

Crashing his way down the 
street, De-De is nat making very 
good time. Goff is gaining an 
him. De-De pitches a handgun 
out the window. Goff scoops it 
up on the run. It's a "throw gun" 
on old pistol he tossed out so 
that Goff would think he's un-
armed. But at the end of the 
block De-De's luck runs out. He 
hits a truck and careens across a 
front lawn and into a house. The 
startled folks on the front porch 
are apporently so used to neigh-
borhood gunfire they don't con-
ned it with this smoking wreck 
in their yard. They think it's a 
traffic accident. As Goff ap-
proaches at a dead run, his 
nightmare is suddenly com-
pounded. Three little kids rush 
down from the porch to the 
driver's window, look in at De-
De sJumped over the wheel , and 
shout for momma to call an am-
bulance. Goff is yelling, "Get 
away from the carl" but they' re 
paralyzed . De-De lifts his head 
slightly, eases his hand down to 
the Ruger 9mm lying on the seat 
beside him, and without lifting 
the gun, fires ten rounds 
through the door. 

The sound of the gunfire is 
contained inside the car so Gaff 
doesn 't even realize he' s being 
shot at until he's hit. One slug 
nicks his forearm, another his 
shoulder, but he can't fire back 
because of the kids. De-De 
meanwhile has recovered his 
senses. He jams the Honda in 
gear and roors off across the 
lawn. Goff blasts away at him as 
he careens around the corner, 
but De-De's taillights vanish in 
the distance. At this point in an 
otherwise spedacular getaway, 

. De-De makes his first mistake. 
He calls his girlfriend on the car 
phone and says he's been hit in 
a shoatout. He tells her to open 
the front door. But he doesn't 
say anything about the cops, so 
she assumes it was rival gang-
bongers. She dials 911 . 

Meanwhile Goff and Free-
man are getting their wounds 
tended by the poramedics. They 
were lucky. Aside from several 
9mm holes in his jacket, Goff's 
three wounds are superficial. 
And Scotty Freeman was saved 
by his bullet-proof vest. The shell 
just nicked the edge of it and 
defleded up under his collar-
bone. They' re on their way 
downtown in the back of an am-
bulance when they happen to 
overhear a 911 call on the radio. 
A man with a gunshot wound 
needs an ambulance. Goff looks 
at Freemon. '"That's gotta be the 
guy .• 

When the gang unit arrives at 
De-De's house to nob him, they 
find seven flattened bullets on 
the pavement beside his cor. 
They apparently fell off his jacket 
when he got out. This time the 
slippery dealer offers no resis-
tance. 

As soon os Goff gets stitched 
up, he and Bob Fischer take a 
ride to the impound yord for a 
look at the unstoppable Hondo. 

It's riddled with holes and all the 
glass is shattered but the damn 
thing still runs. "Quite a testa-
ment to Honda," says Goff. But 
a look inside the trunk reveals 
one of the reasons - a sheet of 
boilerplate steel mounted at the 
forward wall . Gaff recognizes 
this setup. It's what they call a 
"trap car". Behind that bullet-
proof wall there's usually a hid-
den compartment. 

He checks the driver's side in 
front and spots a slight bulge 
under the carpet next to the 
rocker panel. It's a floor-
mounted switch. Gaff clicks it 
with his foot and the bock of the

cash, and the guy jumps out the 
window. 00 you chase him' Or 
do you figure this is for 
enough'" But you don 't have to 
be a police commissioner to see 
the possibilities. The headlines are 
full of it: TAlES OF CORRUPTION

brief period, over twenty officers 
from Brooklyn's Seventy-fifth 
Precind were implicated in drug 

understands corruption, and 
they have a biblical fix an it: 
"Lead us not into temptation.· 
All ongoing narcotics investiga-
tions are handled by the narcot-
ics squad, and the narcotics 
squad itself is focused entirely 
on small-time buy-bust arrests. 
There's almost zero chance of 
anybody in the lower ranks 
stumbling into a roomful of cosh 
or a trucklood of coke. And any 
serious attempt to follow the trail 
upward is discouraged. As they 
told Goff, "You're going after 
the right guys and somebody' s 
gonno get hurt.· 

Of course, there are a cou-

taxes, no benefits, no rent. They 
handle their own insurance, 
make their own collections, and 
the raw materials are so cheap 
they get a 300 percent return on 
the dollar. Which means the 
"G.D.s could spend several mil-
lion dollars a year in bribes to 
Cook County public officials, 
and it would be considered a 
modest cost of doing business. 

Downtown, they look on narcotics as a swamp, 
a sink-hole that can suck your career under in 

an eye blink. The river of money flowing 
through the streets, splashing over the curbs, 
and into the pockets of everybody in sight is 

unlike anything they've ever seen before. 

But despite all the talk of 
high-level payoffs, Frank Goff 
has lately come to fear an even 
more ominous development in 
the ongoing bottle. The Gong-
ster Disciples have discovered 
politics. After a decode of learn-
ing how to manipulate the levers 
of power through surrogates, 
the G.D.s are beginning to look 
directly at the levers themselves. 
Mit's just like the old mob days," 
says Goff. "We're talking about 
a street gong that can intimidate 
people, put up your flyers, tear 
down all the other people's fly-
ers, get people to vote and reg-
ister and come to the polls. This 
group can control a lot of votes. 
They finally realized that they 
can elect whatever politician 
they wont: 

rear seat falls forward . And 
there it is - bogged and ready 
for sole - 1 7 pounds of rock 
and powder cocaine. Along with 
bundles of cash. Tens and twen-
ties mostly. It takes a quarter of 
an hour to count it. It totals 
$53,000. 

Goff is impressed . "The day's 
receipts," he says. And a glance 
at De-De's ledger bears him out. 
The account book they found 
with the dope gives a glimpse of 
the incredible scale of the prob-
lem facing Frank Goff and his 
colleagues. In the first ten days 
of March, this mid-level delivery 
man for the Gangster Disciples 
took in $451 ,000. 

He personally pocketed 45 
grand. How many ather delivery 
jobs on this planet pay $1 .5 mil-
lion a year? If this story were fic-
tion, we would now expect Frank 
Goff to get some kind of commen-
dation. Maybe even a promotion. 
But three days later he got a blunt 
warning from his superiors: 
"Don't ever do that again." While 
it's true that Goff and his men 
recovered a dozen weapons, con-
fiscated seven-and-a-holf kilos of 
coke and $53,000 in cosh and 
shut down a major crack opera-
tion, all in one 18-hour day that 
wasn't their assignment. Their as-
signment was to keep crack away 
from the schools. And while Goff 
can argue that it makes a hell of 
a lot more sense to go for the roots 
of the vine rather than plucking 
the grapes one at a time, his su-
periors don't see it that way. 

First of all, there were a total 
of 72 rounds blasted off in the 
middle of a residential neigh-
borhood. It's a miracle there 
weren't six or eight bodies on 
the pavement, Frank Goff's 
among them. The brass isn' t in-
terested in this kind of wild-west 
gunplay, no matter what the re-
sults. To make sure Goff gets the 
message, they order him back 
into uniform. No more under-
cover work. From now on he and 
his men will ride in marked 
squad cars and stick to busting 
teenage dealers with dime bogs. 
Goff is disgusted, but not sur-
prised. They have a saying 
downtown: "Big dope, big prob-
lems. Little dope, little problems. 
No dope, no problems." Down-
town, they look on narcotics as 
a swamp, a sink-hole that can 
suck your career under in an eye 
blink. The river of money flowing 
through the streets, splashing 
over the curbs, and into the 
pockets of everybody in sight is 
unlike al'lything they've ever 
seen before. There are opportu-
nities for disaster at every turn. 
Says Goff, "You walk in a roam -
you're moking $45,000 a year -
and there's a million dollars in 

dealing, gunrunning, and mur-
der. In neighboring Brownsville, 
ten officers from the Seventy-
third were togged with running 
their own drug ring. In the Thir-
tieth uP. in Harlem - ·Dirty 
Thirty" - two dozen officers 
were charged with shaking 
down dealers and selling the 
drugs themselves. Investigators 
said at least ten of the seventy-
five precinds may be involved . 
In Los Angeles, one of the sher-
iff's elite narcotics squads went 
down in flames when its mem-
bers were videataped stealing 
drug money from a hotel room. 
No sooner was this team dis-
patched to jail than three depu-
ties from another squod were 
busted with over a million dol-
lars they shook out of dealers 
and money launderers. 

In Chicago, they seem to 
have figured out how to avoid all 
this untidyness. This is a city that 

pie of ways to read that state-
ment. Wsciearthe department 
has a legitimate concern about 
holding down the level of may-
hem. But any time the boss 
says, ·Don't open that door, · 
your average Chicago cop is 
going to susped there's 
something behind the door . • , 
have a good ideo,· says Goff. 
· You can't really nail it down, 
but a lot of guys are thinking 
somebody's making bread 
somewhere. H 

Could it be that the MChicogo 
solution· is to intercept the cor-
rupting cosh at the highest level, 
and thus prevent it from trickling 
down and infecting the troops? 
Whether it's true or not, nobody 
argues that it's inconceivable. 
The Gangster Disciples - just one 
of half a dozen drug empires in 
Cook County - take in tens of 
millions a year and their over-
head is peanuts. They pay no 

The political power of the 
G.D.s spilled into the open one 
fall afternoon in 1993 at a 
downtown protest rally over 
school funding. Mayar Ooley 
and his colleages were watch-
ing from the frfth floor of City 
Hall when Loop traffic suddenly 
ground to a halt as the march 
was joined by hundreds of or-
derly, disciplined young African 
A(nericons. What impressed the 
seasoned City Hall onlookers 
more than anything was the fad 
that the troops on the streets 
below had apparently been 
fielded at a moment's notice. 
They carried signs that said 
· 21st CenturyV.O.T.E." Accord-
ing to the mayor' s aides, that's 
the palitical arm of the Gong-
ster Disciples. 

"They've already eleded

DISREDARDING AIDS EPIDEMIC, 
New Jersey Prohibits 

Syringe Eschanges 

Mandatory Minimuins Produce 
Least Bang for the Buck 

by Julie Stewart, President, Families Against Mandatory Minimums 

Epidemic numbers of blood-borne infedions have been 
spread by sharfld use of hypodermic needles. Despite their 
illegality, needle exchange programs have been set up through-
out the United States in order to slow and track the spread of 
HIV/ AIDS and Hepatitis C among injedion drug users. 

Despite reports by The Center for Disease Control that New 
Jersey has the th ird highest injedion-related AIDS rate in the 
United States and Jersey City and Newark rank in the top five 
cities with the highest AIDS rate per capito, the state continues 
to prevent syringe exchanges from operating and bans the sale 
of syringes except by prescription . 

New Jersey women and children are particularly at risk be-
cause New Jersey has a greater percentage of AIDS cases among 
women than any other state and ronks third in the nation in terms 
of the percentage of pediatric AIDS cases. 

Nationally, the engine for the spread of HIV infedion has 
become the sharing of contaminated needles. HIV infedion is 
now the leading cause of death amongst persons aged 25 to 44 
years. In many states, including New Jersey, unlike Canada and 
other notions, sale of syringes is illegal. As a result, sterile 
syringes are scarce and injedion drug users share needles thus 
spreading HIV, Hepatitis B and other blood born diseases. 

On April 3, 1996 the NEW JERSEY Governor's Advisory Coun-
cil on AIDS recommended that New Jersey remove needles from 
the definition of illegal drug paraphernalia and allow syringes to 
be sold over-the-counter without prescriptions. 

Nearby Philadelphia funds Prevention Point, Baltimore oper-
ates its own exchanges and New York State funds a half-dozen 
exchange programs. 

In New Jersey, not only is there no funding for needle 
exchange programs, enforcement officials. adively seek out un-
derground exchanges and prosecute them. 

Despite Federal government finds to the contrary, Governor 
Whitman claims: HNeedie exchange programs send the wrong 
message to our children by condoning illegal drug use." 

In 1998 Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services concluded: • A meticulous scientific review has now 
proven that needle exchange programs can reduce the transmis-
sion of HIV and save lives without losing ground in the bottle 
against illegal drugs." 

Between 1991 and 1997, the U.S. Governmentfunded seven 
reparts on clean needle programs for persons who injed drugs. 
The reparts are unanimous in their conclusions that clean needle 
programs reduce HIV transmission, and none find that clean 
needle programs cause rates of drug use to increase. 

• The verdid is in - mandatory 
minimum sentences produce the 
smallest bang for the buck in 
achieving the national goal of re-
ducing illicit drug use, according to 
a new report from the RAND Drug 
Policy Research Center. 

The comprehensive report ti -
tled "Mandatory Minimum Drug 
Sentences: Throwing Away the 
Key or the Taxpayer's Money?" 
provides the first qualitative 
analysis of how successful these 
sentences are in reducing drug 
use and its consequences. 

Its authors com pore the cost 
effectiven<!ss of extended sentences 
in reducing cocaine consump-
tion and crime to conventional 
law enforcement (such as more 
arrests, confiscations, prosecu-
tions and standard-length incar-
cerations) and treatment of heavy 
drug users. Mandatory minimums 
came in last. 

The RAND report found that 
most drug-related crime is eco-
nomically motivated and asso-
ciated with the amount of 
money flowing through the co-
caine market. Treatment re-
moves some users from the 
market altogether. In this way, 
the demand for drugs drops, 
along with drug spending and 
the money dealers earn from 
selling drugs. As drug dealing 
becomes less profitable, fewer 
people become dealers. And 
because drugs are less expen-
sive, fewer thefts are commit-
ted to pay for drugs. 

The study calculated that if $1 
million more were spent on each 
drug strategy over 15 years, 
mandatory minimum sentences 
would produce The least bang 
for the buck and treatment 
would provide the biggest bong 
for the buck: mandatory mini-
mums would reduce notional 
cocaine consumption by 13 kilo-
grams, conventional enforce-
ment . would cut it by 27 
kilograms, and treatment of 
heavy users would slash it by 
more than 100 kilograms. 

The authors concluded that 
the most cost-effedive way to

Hamedah Ali Hasan 
age 30, serving LIFE without parole 

charged with conspiracy to distribute co-
caine/ cocaine base, interstate travel in 

the aid of racketeering, and use of a tele-
phone to .commit a felony 

II, was not willing to lie for the Idear.11 
Hamedah Ali Hasan's instrudors in the Steps to Success 

Program attest that she was on impressive student with lots of 
promise. She was poised to make a decent life for herself and 
her three daughters, ages 11 , 7 , and 1, and ready to seek 
employment with the exceptional skills she had . Unfortunately, 
she never got the chance to prove herself. 

Instead, Hamedah sits in prison facing a life sentence for a 
crime she did not commit. She has no prior criminal or arrest 
history. She was never observed doing anything illegal related 
to the offenses of which she has been convided . Shortly after her 
arrest, she was aHered Immunity (all charges dropped) in 
exchange for her "cooperation" with the U.S. Attorney in 
obtaining a convidion against her cousin . She had no knowledge 
of the offenses and was not willing to lie for the "deal". 

The trial consisted primarily of hearsay testimony from 
alleged co-conspirators who were e ither getting Immunity 
themselves or currently serving prison sentences and testifying 
in exchange for a possible sentence redudion. 

NMy experience has clearly shown me that a/most any violation 
of the law is excusable as long as the accused 'cooperates' with 
government aHorneys and/ or oHida/s. N

Handling the 
Dreaded "L" 

Word in Debate 
Kevin 8. Zeese, President, 

Common Sense for Qrug Policy 

You're a Legallzerl 
That is what the prohibitionists like to exclaim 

wh.n they debate anyone who supports anything 
I.ss than an all out War on Drugs. 

Legalization is a difficult word to use in debate 
because it is ill defined. 

When I am accused of being a legalizer I say: "If 
you mean selling crack on the street corner to kids, 
that would be absurd and I am against it. In fad 
the drug war mark.t results in crack on the corner 
not only sold to kids but oft.n sold by kids." 

Mif on the other hand you mean d.vising a 
syst.m of regulation wh.re th.re are limits to 
adolescent access and rational treatm.nt for both 
legal and illegal drugs in accordance to their lev.1 
of dang.r, let's talk about how to bring this.about. M

all the evidence from bath sides. 

• Government Documents -
We maintain an extensive col-
lection of Federal and State 

Government documents related 
to drug policy including many 
reports which have never been 
formally published or are so rare 
that they are not available in 
most libraries.

Continued from page 4 
Drug Reform Makes Major Gains 
paign, with public marches and 
opposition to the drug war. The 
Independent on Sunday is spear-
heading the effortwith support 
by Virgin-Atlantic CEO, Richard 
Branson, Body Shop CEO Anita 
Roddick, and former Beatles 
member Paul McCartney. 

• With landslide support of 
2/3 of the voters, the Swiss peo-
ple voted to support continued 
heroin maintenance programs 
in their country. 

6. Illegal Drugs Continue 
to Drop In Price, While "Po-
tency Increases. 

• The ONDCP published fig-
ures which show the price of 
cocaine and heroin is a mere 
fraction of what it was in the 
early 1980s while produdion 
and purity of the substances is 
many times higher. 

• Federally sponsored stud-
ies show that adolescent access 
to marijuana is virtually un-
changed over the past 20 years 
of the drug war (nearly 90% say 
that it is 'very easy' or 'fairly 
easy' to obtain), and that illicit 
drug use among adolescents 
has risen steadily since 1992. 

7. The Federal Govern-
ment Continues to Employ 
the Same Failed Strategies. 

• The 1998 National Drug 
Control Strategy focuses 2/3 of 

. its $17 billion budget on supply 
redudion, which is the least ef-
fective method to reduce do-
mestic drug consumption. 

• In a federally-funded study, 
the Research Triangle Institute 
showed that Drug Abuse Resis-
tance Education (DARE) had no 
effed on adolescent drug use, 
yet it continues to receive mil-
lions in funding. 

• The prison system remains 
the most common social response 
to drug use and abuse. The na-
tion's jails and prisons now hold 
more than 1 .7 million Americans, 
while drug treatment centers can-
not meet demand. 

• Marijuana arrests reached 
an all-time high of 695,201 in 
1997, according to the latest fig-
ures from the FBI. 87.2% of the 
arrests for possession, not 
manufadure or sale. 

8. Malor Divisions Spilt 
Drug Warrior Movement In 
Government. 

• Drug Czar General McCaf-
fery aligned with Republicans and 
publicly disputee with AIDS Cza-
rina Sandra Thurman and Secre-
tary of Health and Human 
Services Donna Shalala on nee-
dle exchange programs. Leaders 
af the Congressional Black Cau-
cus called for McCaffrey's resig-
nation aver the incident. 

• Ronald Reagan appointee, 
U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin refused to hand out a 
mandatory minimum sentence 
to a crack addict, saying that if 
the defendant were in a differ-
ent economic bracket he would 

be in the Betty Ford Clinic and 
not in prison . When ordered to 
give a longer sentence by an 
appeals court, Sporkin removed 
himself from the case in protest.
