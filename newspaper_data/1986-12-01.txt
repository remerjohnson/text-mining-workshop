O October 28, 1986, the San Diego City Coun il approved an emergency 
ordinance giving it the power to 
block further testi ng by General 
AtomiC Technologies on its pilot 
toxic waste inci nerator. 

The emergency ordinance 
"establishes a Conditional Usc 
Permit (CUP) process [or 
hazardous waste treatment

demonstration facilities ." 

• Although GA Technologies i not 
specifically named in the 
ordi nance, the nation' largest 

• privately owned fusion resear h 
company is the only firm which 
is immediately effected by the 

ouncil's decision . 
In order to stimulate the 

development of new techrlOlogie 
[or the disposal of toxic wa tes, 
the federal government ha 
recently created a new Research , 
Development and Demons tnltion 
(RD&D) permit to be I<;c;ucd by 

the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to companies 
developing new methods of toxic 
waste di posa\. Until now, 
applicants for the RD&D permit 
dealt only with state and federal 
agenCies. 

In July of 1985, General 
Atomi Technologies of La Jolla , 
located on Torrey Pines Mesa 
Just north of the UCSD campus, 
submitted an application to the 
EPA for an RD&D permit. GA 
Technologie.s wants the permit 
so they can continue testing a 
newly developed method of toxic 
waste incineration on a more 
routine ba is. 

The company's move to 
acquire the RD&D permit 
triggered opposition from speCial 
Interest group who in tum

efficient incinerating techniques 
available to date . The company 
ultimately hopes to market

UCSD gets grant 
for celebration 

UCSD has been awarded an 
$8S ,000 grant from the National 
Endowment for the Humanities 
to present a multi-part program 
in celebration of the Bicentennial 
of the American Constitution. 
The University has made a 
commitment to raising $35,000 
in additional matching funds in 
support of this program. 

The program includes six free 
public lectures featuring noted 
scholars, a three-day scholarly 
symposium, a major exhibit of 
important documents pertaining 
to the Constitution, and a special 
program for area secondary 
social science teachers, 
culminating in a four-day 
curriculum writing workshop. 

With additional support from 
the James s. Copley Library, the 
UCSD Chancellor's Associates , 
and the UCSD Dean of Arts and 
Humanities, the program will 

BLOOM COUNTY 

emphaSize a comparitive study 
of nation building and 
constitution wriung in the 
Americas, comparing and 
contrasting the experience of the 
United States with that of our 
Latin American neighbors. 

The six free public lectures, 
beginmng in January, 1987, will 
feature such nationally 
recognized scholars as John 
Munin , Ph.D., from Princeton 
University; Peter Smith, Ph.D. 
from UCSD; Edmund Morgan, 
Ph .D., from Yale University; and 
Daniel Levine, Ph.D. , from the 
University of Michigan. 

According to project director 
Robert C. Ritchie, Ph .D., the 
program will provide a unique 
opportunity to introduce the San 
Diego Community to the wealth 
of rare historical materials related 
to the Mexican and American 
Constitutions that are available 
in San Diego. Because of their 
value, these items are rarely 
exhibited . 

According to Dr. Ritchie , the 
American/ Latin American 
comparative framework of the 
project will have particular 
relevance for th e San Diego area , 
with its important Hispanic 
cultural roots. 

University receives 
private funding 

Private support for the 
University of California, which 
has increased steadily for more 
than a decade , reached a record 
$255 million in 1985-86, a 12 
percent gain over the 1984-85 
figure of nearly ~n8 million . 

William Baker, vice president 
of budget and university 
relations , wid Regents meeting in 
Los Angeles wday (November 20) 
that the funds augment, but do 
not replace state funds, and are 
used to provide the "margin of 
excellence" for which the 
University is noted. 

"The generosity of individuals 
and corporations enables us to 
prOvide services that are beyond 
the bounds of strict necessity. 
Their gifts enable us to provide 
additional scholarships and 
research grants, as well as to 
endow chairs to attract 
distinguished new faculty and to

GiftS to the University or to 
intlividual campuses can be

campus foundations. Donors may 
also specify an area they wish to

instructional activities . 

Fonner Chancellor 
under investigation 

The financial activities of 
fonner UC Santa Barbara 
Chancellor Robert Huttenback 
are under criminal investigation 
by the Santa Barbara COUnty 
Grand Jury and the Sheriffs 
Department follOWing his 
expenditure of University funds 
on home improvements. 

Huttenback resigned as 
Chancellor last July when the 
information was disclosed, but 
remains on a leave of absence 
and is ineligible to teach. 

LaSt summer, UC auditors 
detennined Huttenback misspent 
$174,000 of university money on 
his personal residence. In 
addition, the UCSB Foundation, 
the primary fund raising branch 
of the university, was found of 
violating sound business 
practices by granting an 
unsecured $9,000 loan to 
Hunenback. 

According to UC auditor 
Robert Tuffnell. he found no 
willful lOtent to deceive or cover 
up on anyone's part , although 
there were inappropriate and 
unauthorized expenditures 

Huuenback contends the 
expendItures were well spent on 
the grounds that he uses hIS 
home for university purposes 
and fundraising. 

After the UC investigauon 
staned , nine UCSB profes ors 
sent a letter to UC President 
Gardner suggesting Huttenback 
resign. UCSB students also 
questioned Hunenback's 
reliability by giving him a no-
confidence vote by a 3-1 margin. 

Parking petition 
garners support 

The AS has gathered nearly 
4,000 student, staff and faculty 
signatures on its petition, which 
concerns the reinstatement of 
nickle and dime parking meters. 
According to AS Commissioner 
Dave Marchick, the petition has 
raised consciousness about 
parking on campus and the 
decision-making process 
concerning it. 

Students can still sign the 
petition at the following 
locations' Peterson Hall, the AS 
Office, the General Store, POP, 
the Revelle Sundty Store, and the 
Undergraduate Library. 

Eating disorder 
program offered 

A six-week ourpaUeht program 
to help lOdlviduals with cating 
disorders such as bulimia and 
anorexIa is being offered by UC D 
Psychiatric Associates, an 
outpatient clinic affiliated with the 
UCSD School of Medicine and 
Medical Center. 

The UCSD Eating Disorders 
Clinic combines various 
therapies to treat eating 
disorders, since these disorders 
can be traced to a number of 
factors, according to Jaga Nath 
Glassman, M.D., clinic director. 

Patients enrolled in the 
program meet three evenings a 
week for six weeks. On 
Tuesdavs, panicipants eat a well! 
balanced, wholesome meal, since 
many of these patients don't 
know what a nonnal meal is 
anymore, said Glassman. 

Group therapy is conducted 
on Thursdays, and Fridays are 
reserved for family sessions and 
non-verbal therapies involving 
the use of an and movement. 
Problems such as loneliness, 
depreSSion or family difficulties 
are addressed as pan of the 
basis of the eatin~ disorder. 

These individuals are typicaUy 
preoccupied with body image 
and will insist that they are fat , 
even if they are at 80 or 90 
percent of their recommended 
body weight, said Glassman. The 
behavioral problems that develop 
can include an inability to 
handle stre s, or more serious 
problems such as depression . 

Because eating disorders result 
from a combination of 
psychological, social, biological 
and perhaps even genetic 
problems, Glassman feels that the 
most effective treatment 
addresses all of these issues. The 
clinic provides psychiatriC and 
behavioral suppon for the 
individual, family therapy, and 
pharmacological treatment if 
appropriate. 

After the six-week program, 
the patient can continue with 
weekIy sessions if necessary. 
Although the clinic is an 
outpatient program that does not 
require a hospital stay, 
individuals with serious medical 
problems will be advised to seek 
hospital care .

AS Muir senior senator 
found guilty of misconduct 
By JOHN SINGH, Stag Wnter 

T HE AS Judicial Board , in a November 21 hearing, found AS Senior SenatOr 
Gregory MacCrone guilty of 
illegally assuming the Chair of 
the AS Council at a June 2 
meeting and of conflict of 
interest during a debate over the 
new indicator's 1986-87 budget. 

"It is the formal Judgement of 
the AS judicial Board that 
Gregory MacCrone be barred 
from AS Council and 
subcommittee meetings; he 
cannot vote effective November 
26, 1986 at 4:30 pm. [He] is 
barred from AS .office [and] 
cannot function as Muir Senior 
Senator in any fonn, or Council 
Pro Tempore," the fonnal 
statement said. 

According to the statement, 
MacCrone "received 'personal 
satisfaction' from his remark in 
the police repon 'these men do 
not smell very good: referring to 
Jelger Kalmijn and Byron Morton 
of the new indicator collective: 

MacCrone first came under 
fire in June, after physically 
assaulting Montgomery Kroopkin, 
a member of the new indicator 
collective. In an October 21 
meeting, the Muir College 
Judiciary Board found MacCrone 
guilty of assa ult and was 
subsequently reprimanded and 
prohibited from entering the 
offices of the coUective. 

MacCrone said he is not 

happy with the AS ruling and 
plans to appeal. 

"I'll appeal it not because I 
disagree with it, even though I 
<;10 disagree with iI, but because 
the decision was a wrong one," 
MacCrone said. 

"My testimony clearly showed 
that I did not assume the chair 
illegaUy," MacCrone said. 

The AS Council Chair, Greg 
Hom, wanted to participate in 
discussion of the new indicator's 
budget, MacCrone said . He 
added that as President Pro 
Tempore he felt he was right in 
assuming the chair. He said he 
did not violate "the intent of 
impartiality of the chair," as 
stated by the Judicial Board. 

'They [the JudiCial Board] 
didn't show any conOict of 
interest just because of an 
altercation between me and 
Kroopkin, and they didn't show 
any personal gain because of an 
argument with Kroopkin or a 
comment in the police report," 
MacCrone said . 

Members of the new indicator 
said they are pleased with the 
judgment, but believe that it 
should have come earlier and 
been harsher. 

''The judicial Board agreed 
with us that he was guilry and so 
they banned him," said new 
indicator member Joe Wainio. 
"On that specific charge (the one 
against MacCrone) they did a 

pftase join US in honoring 
U.CS.'D. faculty autfwr 

great job. I think that was really 
the only conclusion they could 
have reached: The collective has 
eight charges against the 
AsSOCIated Students. 

In their charge against 
MacCrone, new indicator 
members stated that "MacCrone's 
assault against a number of 
members of the new indicator 
collective at the preceding 
council meeting created a clear 
conDict of interest." 

Kroopkin, emphasizing that 
his views are not those of the 
collective as a whole, said the 
MacCrone case is the "tip of an 
iceberg." 

"It is reaUy important that 
[people] understand that 
MacCrone is really not the 
problem with the AS. and that in 
fact the AS is not the major 
problem ," Kroopkin said. "The 
administration itself - people 
like Watson and Atkinson - are 
really the real problem and the 
reason they are is because of 
their relationship with the 
military industrial complex and 
the kind of university that UCSD 
really is." 

MacCrone said he feels the 
judicial procedure is unclear and 
needs work, and said it would 
have been optimal had work 
been done on the procedures 
before the altercation and 
subsequent rulings took 
place. ~

Sgt. Jones suggests that the students be aware oj car burglaries. 

UC police catch 
car burglars 
By JULIE KAY RANDALL 

C AMPUS police arrested five males after observing them steal the stereo out 
of a car on North Torrey Pines 
Road twO weeks ago . 

In the past eight weeks, UCSD 
has experienced 33 car 
burglaries. Attempting to end this 
proliferation of offenses, campus 
police did a crime series study 
and found that all 33 cases 
exhibited similar circumstances. 
Cars were burglanzed olel}' 
during the week. and 10 broad 
daylight. Of the 33 targets, 26 
were VWs. 

Knowing a little more about 
the tendencies of their quarry, 
police conducted carnpuswide 

"stakeouts" in unmarked vehicles 
from November 10 to November 
14. Near 10 am on November 14, 
police spied three young males 
casually stalking Revelle parking 
lOt 10 1. The pretentious 
characters moved to North 
Torrey Pines Road, where they 
remained , undaunted by the 
busy street. They broke a car 
window. One of them slipped 
into the front seat, and from a 
reclined position , removed the 
stereo within 45 seconds. 

With the stereo under his 
jacket, the suspect and his two 
companions walked casually 
down the street. They met two 
others who had been waiting in 
a car. All five , four juveniles and 
one adult from the linda Vista

Political forums, such as 
debates or speeches, are 
definitely a good thing for 
everyone. They allow people to 
make comparisons of different 
poims of view, which then 
enables them to make up their 
mind on who or what to vote 
for. 

Childish activity on the pan of 
the audience at these forums is 
simply unacceprable, [ was very 
sorry to wimess this kind of 
action by some of the students 
here on our campus, 

A few weeks ago before the 
congressional election, 
Congressman Jim Bates and his 
challenger appeared on the gym 
steps to promote their 
campaigns, The liberal 
dominated crowd gave a very 
warm welcome to Democratic 
candidate Bates when he was 

introduced, They all listened 
carefully and gave him the 
proper respect that is given to a 
speaker. But [ was more than 
disturbed to see the students' 
reaction when it was Republican 
candidate Bill Mitchell's tum. He 
was greeted with vicious boos 
upon his introduction. It was 
extremely rude and ignorant on 
the part of these students; they 
couldn't even be quiet, let alone 
listen while Mr, Mitchell was 
speaking, 

Not only is this type of 
conduct interuptive - when 
supporters act in such a manner 
- but it also reduces the 
possibility that someone might 
respect the opposing party's 
candidate, Such was the case for 
me last year when Jesse Jackson 
spoke at the Revelle Plaza, 
Reverend Jackson was torally 
getting the Iib'!ral dominated

All in all, it's just another word on the wall 
Editor's Note: This anonymous 
commenrary was written in reply to 
the November 17 article, "Wnting 
on the wall," authored by a 
professor. In order to uphold the 
Guardian dextrine oj "one person 's 
anonymIty is as good as another's, " 
we will print this article without a 
byline, 

It's already past five o'clock 
and I'm in the stairwell fimshing 
up another passage , ThiS time 
I'm wri ti ng on the sixth floor of 
H&'SS, A professor walks tn, but [ 
don't try to conceal my actions. 
"Are you one of the people who 
writes this terrible trash?" he 
asks, How could [ answer hIm? 
My feelings are not garbage, They 
are relevant and hIghly 
significant aspects of my era. 
What I write now will serve as a 
beacon for the generations of 
frightened , unsure wallwriters to 
come. And they will come. 

So ) follow tht· angry professor, 
or rather, he follows me. While 
we walt tn the hall for the 
elevator, the professor badgers 
me , I wait anxiously for the 
arnval of the car. He tells me 
that I am inconSIderate and 
unfeehng. I do not respond , 
simply pray that no one will 
hear. Another professor steps 
from his office JUSt then and 
Joins us, h[ caught thIS young

flustered professor announces to 
hIS dISInterested colleague 
"What board?" the other

gets in, and my accuser-

professor, toO, seems not to care,

But where lies the professor's

, All legalities aside, his spiel 
about consideration for the

leaves me in awe of his

Impeach Bonzo 
By PETER QUERelA 

Congress should immediately 
sanction another special 
investigatory committee to 
conduct hearings and examine 
evidence to determine whether 
President Reagan has committed 
any impeachable offenses. The 
first step toward implementing 
such an investigation is already 
scheduled to begin shortly after 
Thanksgiving. 

And , if. as it appears, Reagan 
in fact did abuse his position 
and violated the oath of offIce, 
than such impeachment 
proceedings should Swiftly be 
brought to a onclusion, even if 
such action means America 
would be stuck with the hkes of 
Vice President George Bush for 
the remaIning two years of 
Reagan's second term. 

The lraman arms for hostages 
deal , or as Reagan at least 
Implied , an arrangement where 
weapons were given as a peace 
offering to the facist dictator 
Ayatollah Khomeini , IS Simply 
the most recent foreign relations 
disaster perpetrated by this 

administration, If ordinary 
incompetence, instead of cold, 
calculated deception were the • 
mechanism triggering such a 
worldwide collapse of America's 
credibility, then perhaps the 
President and his-collaborators, 
in their collective ignorance, 
might be forgIven . But such mept 
amateurism and mindless 
blundering clearly is not the 
case, 

The news media, which 
Reagan and his image molders 
so dearly despise , has broken 
repeated stories of coverups, 
ommission of facts, 
irresponsibility. gross negligence , 
wanton disregard of human life, 
outright lies, fabrication of 
evidence, and deliberate criminal 
intent in violating numerous 
national and international laws. 

The Reagan AdmInistration'S 
setting up of a secret arms 
supply line between the United 
StateS and our sworn enemy. the 
Ayatollah, is unque tionably a 
premeditated circumventton if

Notes from the underground 
Continued from page .. 
American Rodrigo Rojas de 
Negri's death and political 
affiliations. Jantz wrote, "Rojas ... 
was a very active member of a 
violent opposition group and he 
was the one canying the gasoline 
which proved to be his final 
opponent." 

This ludicrous allegation made 
by Jantz cannm be found in any 
journal or newspaper except for 
in the Review. Negri, a resident of 
Washington D.C., had gone to 
Chile in search of his roots and 
to try his skill as a photographer. 
His mother, Veronica de Negri , 
(who herself had been jailed by 
Pinochet's military regime for two 
years, during which time she was 
tortured and raped by her 
captors), told a San Diego 
audience this September how 
apolitical Rodrigo was, and how 
afraid he was of visiting Chile in 
the first place. Negri had been in 
Chile for only two months before 
his death, and as eyeWitness 
accounts in Claudia Dreifus' 
article on Negri in "Mmher 
Jones" describe ir, "On July 2, the 
day of a general strike, 
Rodrigo ... began snapping 
pictures. Crowds had gathered at 
a bus stop. DemonstratOrs were 
mustering. Suddenly, a military 
vehicle drove into the street. 
Soldiers in uniform and 
blackface went out into the 
crowd and began attacking 
civilians with butts of their rifles. 
Carmen Quintana Arancibia, an 
lS-year-old engineering student, 
fell , and Rodrigo, who was

escaping, turned around and ran 
back [0 drag the injured young 
woman away. The soldiers 
attacked Rodrigo and beat him 
hOrribly ... while Rodrigo and 
QUIntana lay wounded on the 
street, a soldier went to a nearby 
pickup truck, took out a bottle of 
flammable liquid, poured it on 
the two young people , and 
ignited them ... the military men 
watched it all impassively ... 
tossed them into the pickup 
truck, and dumped them in a 
ditch four miles away." 

Of course Jantz has no 
problem with these types of 
atroci ties, for he and his friend 
who visited Chile for a short 
period this summer did nm see 
what the hoopla in the media 
concerning Pinochet's mass 
repression of the populace was 
all about. Forget the poverty, 
unemployment, right-wing death 
squads, and the populace's cry 
for democracy, implied Jantz, 
"Santiago b clean. Workers are 
constantly sweeping the 
sidewalks; there is no graffiti to 
be seen," The thousands of 
journalists (and academics) who 
report from, and either live, or 
have lived in Chile, "have never 
visited Chile," says Jantz, And 
besides, Jantz spits, "the real 
problems in Chile are occasional 
(like torture and a 13-year 
military dictatorship), isolated 
(such as decrepit poverty among 
40 percent of the population), 
and fomented by groups 
opposed to any form of 
government except totalitarian in

nature." (Like the Christian 
Democrats?) 

Bany jantz's final analysis that 
"Pinochet will nm tum the 
country over to a false 
democracy" is partially correct. 
Pinochet himself wants to be 
dictator for life, and won't be 
turning over power to any 
democratic group unless he is 
forced to . This is fine with Jantz, 
it appears, as "Santiago is a 
vibrant, alive, bustling city." 
Reminds one of Mussolini's 
appraisal of Germany in the late 
1930s, doesn't it1 

Fading Images 
Now that the conservative 

whitewash about the state of the 
national political consciousness 
- that it is creeping further and 
further to the right - has been 
properly unveiled as nothing 
more than a public relations 
coup by the Reagan 
Administration , we can get on 
with the more serious 
discussions over which direction 
this country's populace is really 
turning to. 

It came as no surprise to this 
writer that the Republican Party 
lost control of the Senate, and 
that the olficial leadership of the 
Democratic Party was unable to 
tum back a surge of progressive 
candidate victories during the 
Democratic primaries, For as 
wimesssed by a variety of 
academics since 1984, a growing 
majority of the citizenry have 
discovered the true leanings of 
Reaganism. that being lies 

, I 

disguised as the truth via the 
President's uncanny talent for 
manipulating information 
through his most succesful 
vehicle, television, Given the 
hypothesis that most people 
have love/ hate relationships with 
television characters, one can 
safely say that viewers of "The 
White House" began to distrust 
the mumblings of Dutch Reagan 
as much as they disbelieve the 
non-racist claims of Dynasty's 
Blake Carrington, What is truly 
tragiC though , is that it took the 
public nearly six years to express 
disgust over the unending 
hypocrisies of this 
Administration , 

Polls have told us time and 
time again that once a person is 
told the entire breadth of a 
Reagan governmental action, that 
he will frequently oppose It . 
Until the [ran-Contra debacle, 
however, the majority of the 
public chose to sit on their 
hands and hope that the 
President would jump on his 
whi te horse, ride across the 
oceans of his self-deceit , and 
save this nation from 
international disgrace, When the 
public jumped up from their 
chairs last week, though , they 

. 

realized that their nightmares 
had come true: that the vocal 
opposition to Reaganism had 
been right all along in saying 
that this Adminsitration is 
nothing more than a historical 
abomination born out of the 
Cold War, whose true aim is to 
achieve total domination of the 
world , and who would achieve 
this at any cost. 

The Reagan Administration , 
along with their imperialistic 
counterpans :n the Soviet Union , 
care little for human ethics, Both 
the United States, and the USSR, 
are fueling bloody terror in the 
Third World by arming anyone 
is Sight. This practice of bilateral 
carving up of spheres of 
domination arises our of the 
overrung doctrine of "strategic 
interest," and enables the 
Administration to rationalize the 
breaking of both Constitutional 
and [nternationallaws on a 
regular basis. Fortunately the 
public isn't buying the Reagan 
Administration's rationale for 
using [ranian blood money to 
arm the comras at this juncture. 
Today at least, it appears as if 
the illusions about-Reagan's 
sincerity are being shane red, IZJ

Takvorian claims the 
infonnatlon in Som merville 's

you review the permit 
appltcanon you will not find any 
risk assessment." 

According to Rohr, a health 
risk analysis was not needed in 
the permit applica tion , and 
before an y test can be 
conducted, the APCD must 
receive an elemental analysis 
describi ng the exact percentages 
of every component in the waste . 
This data will be used in their 
pretest risk assessment. She also 
added that the emissions of non-
criteria pollutants Takvorian 
mentioned , arc regulated via a 
destruction removal effiCiency 
standard, which requires 99.9999

times. The prOjected emiSSIOns 
from the CBC used in the repon 
constituted a worst case scenario: 
a foggy day with an atmospheric 
inversion and without total 
combustion efficiency. 

In refe rence to the hazard s of 
transporting the wastcs 
expressed by opponents. Baxter 
commented that "the total waste 
handled during the entire five-
year demonstration period Will 
amount to less than a dozen 
semi-truck load 'i." 

He al 0 stressed that the EPA 
permit makes three essential 
requirements: that the faCility 
"have qualified management and 
research talent , appropriate 
fac ilities and approved operating 
procedures." 

Takvonan further cites 
inconsiste ncies between what the 
draft permit prescribes as 
opera tional guideli nes and the 
current capabilities of the CBC. 
For instance, the draft pennit 
allows the permittee to bum a 
maximum of 350 55 gallon 
drums per test series. Yet, 
according to Rohr, "Each test will 
treat at most an average of 50 to 
60 barrels."

B DAVID FORMAN. -wll Wnto 

LA T Monday afternoon In downtown La Jolla, Warwlcks &>oks concluded 
their "Fall Celebration of 
Authors" series WIth a book 
sIgning by author UC D 
profe or Bram DiJkstra . His 
newly pubhshed bo k. Idol - oj 
Pennslt)' Fantaslcs (?f Fc:nllnlnC 
EVIl In Fin de Slec/(' Culrure , IS an 
In-depth exploration of cultural 
m/s0l:\Yny at the end of the 
mneteenth and twentIeth 

enturie~ 
"What the book IS about IS 

speCIfically the way In which the 
art and the li terature and the 
science all came together to put 
together what I would caU a war 
on women at the tum of the 
centur) ," DIJkstra saId . 

Idols of PerversIty IS full of 
examples, both Visual and 
literary, of thIS "war on women ." 
The text draws from wnters as 
dIfferent as Baudelaire and Oscar 
WIlde and artists such as Plcas~ and RenOir DIJkstra 
expands on the theme of 
misogyny through hundreds of 
paintings from lesser known 
artists whose contribution to the 
art world ma\, have been 
minImal , but \\'hose (lntrlbutlon 
to the process of degenerarron 
was great. 

Accordmg to DIJkstra, In 
Origll1s of Spwes DarWIn pOInted 

hor professor Bram r~kstra 
as part oj hiS 17lcoastal book SIgning tour. 

out that the origins of hfe are In 
hlsexual organtsms and these 
bIsexual organtsms devcloped 
intO unisexual creatures, so 
s lentlsts began to sa) that It '~ a 
sIgn of evolution If man become~ 
more manly and woman more 
feminlnc 

"What I say In the book b that 
rcall\' our notions about what 

\\'o~en are In the twentieth 
century are based nor on 
knowledge of the inherent 

psychology of women but rather 
on the fea~ or the Justlf/(atlOn 
of tho e fear on thc basis of 
falsc ience Our twentieth 
ccntur), attitudes are tmilt ng In 
the wake 0 the attitudes [hat 
were developed In the mmeenth 
enwl''\' 

DiJk~tra sharply -rm Ized the 
"false SCienL e" of the period dnd 
pOInted out that dntl-fem/ntSt 
sentiments had eXIsted fo r 
centunes, but only during this 

period was it explained 
sClenrificall), . It became pall of 
the dommant culrure\ 
understanding of evolution, and

After getting a BA and a

recognition from Publrshcr, 
Weekly and The cw Yorh TImes. 

DiJkstra suggested the 
de\elopment of social mythology

peo ple's concepts of o ne

that the scntiments sp read

The book also i nvesng,lle the 
(orrclation between anti-
feminism and anfl-SCmlll.,m , 
concludIng that the geno Ide In

truly an extension of this cultural

century, he postulates, the plight 
of fem inIsm and JudaIsm were 
one and the same. An Important 
theme of the book IS how thesc

The authors wife and'ra, who 
Jokingly rders to herself as "the 
press agcnt - and the wife ," 
seemed more excited than 

DiJk~tra over their upcomi ng

DIJkstra added. "Th~re are so

A healthy checkup for Clinic's first year 
By MARK SANDERSON 
"H ONEY, can you take 

Johnny Jr. to the 
doctor, he's gO! a 

fever?" 
"I'm afraid not, sweetheart, I've 

got a mid-term In Poli-Sci that 
I've got to study for." 

Believe It or nO!, thIS scenano 
is not uncommon for a 
significant number of UCSD 
students. The act of pursuing a 
degree IS an undertaking few 
would consider easy. But add to 
that the responsiblhry of caring 
for a child , and studYing drops 
on the list of pnontles. 

Dr Dorns Howell , a 
pedlamclan and hematologist 
from UniverSity HOSPital , docs 
not have a prescription to lessen 
the responsibIlities of being a 
student-parem but through the 
Pediatrics Chnic held after hours 
at the Studem Health Cemer Dr 
Howell has been proVIding a 
leamIng enVironment [or 
student-pare nts and UC D 
medical .. tudems alike 

HaVing Just (e\ebra ted I[S first 

year In operation, the Pediamcs 
Clintc has become a primary 
source of medIcal are for nearly 
160 reglstered pauents The 
clinic , run by Dr. Howell with 
the assistance of several 
volunteer medIcal students, IS 
currently a free service . 

"We want to help young 
people to become better . 
paren t< "said Dr. Howell , who IS 
also chairperson of the student 
health adVis .y commmee. 

'True peulamcs," according to 
Howe II , "relies on preventlon and 
intervention." She beheves that 
educating young parents to 
properly care for their chtldren 
WlII relieve some of the fmanclal 
and emotional burden associated 
Wlth a chlld 's illness. Howell's 
hohstlc phtlosophy of medicine 
stems lrom her beltef that 
phYSICIans and the drugs they 
prescnhe should only be utilized 
when absolutely necessary 
Common sense and some baSIC 
Knowledge of parrntlng .Ire the 

key~ to at le a~t recognizing the 

connection between the kInds of 
common cold and o-ther ailments 
which afflict children. 

Dr. Howell's resources are 
limited to the spaces donated by 
the Student Health Center, 
"freebie pharmaceuticals" which 
Dr. Howell brings to thc cli nic 
and a part-time Clerk! 
bookkeeper whose se rvices are 
provided by Dr. Joseph Watson, 
Vice-Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs. 

Because it b :1 mited in 
faci lities, personnel and in 1(S 
hours of operation , the clinic 
cannO! provide all the services 
necessarl for complete pedia tric 
care. Should a child require more 
extensive care than the chnic 
can offer, the pare nt may h ave to 
opt for th e costly world 01

Continued from page 8 
funding has become necessary to 
meet the needs of those who use 
the clinic, as well as those who 
will take advantage of its services 
in th e future. 

Dr. Howell's wish list for the 
coming year mcludes access to 
funds which would enable her to 
set up a loan system to aid 
students .\lith the hIgh cost of 
medical care . "If the clinic were 
to receive a loan, It would be for 
students to buy Insurance . .. not 
Just medical care ," s,ild Howell. 
Insurance , Howell contends, is 
an important factor 10 alleviating 
the financial strain placed on 
young parents confronted with a 
sick child . 

A source of revenue would also 
allow the clinic to bring in 
additional licensed physicians. 
At this point, Dr. Howell is the 
only licensed pediatncian at the 
clinic , with the exception of an 
occassional volunteer physician. 
"The patients," said Howell, 
"deserve better than just one 
doctor." Personally. Dr. Howell 

can see no more than five or six 
children a night, and until the 
clinic is able to obtain a gr.lnt or 
other funding it will have to 
continue offering limited 
services. 

A pennanent pediatrics clinic 
is in the planning stages, but it 
has been faced with delays. Dr. 
Howell hopes it might be in 
operation by the Fall of 1987. 
The pennanent facility would 
absorh the patients who currently 
are registered in the free clinic. It 
..... 'ill be a fully staffed operation 
with facilities for complete 
pediatric care. Services will not 
be free . but Dr. Howell hopes to 
prepare student-parents for this 
reality by stressing the 
importance of insurance 
coverage. 

"I would like to see every 
student carry health insurance," 
said Howell. At this time , about 
half of those partiCipating in the 
clinic have insurance, either 
through the university or through 
an insurance company. Starting 
next year, though, Dr. Howell 
hopes to utilize the insurance 
held by some of the students to 
help pay for the clinic's 
services.

UCSD runner-up in tourney 
Stanislaus captures Triton Tip-Off title 

By JOHN SCHACHT 

As spurts go, this one was a dandy. Cal Stat'! Stanislaus 
scored the first 14 points of the 
second-half and cruised to a 79-
69 win over UC San Diego 
Saturday Night to capture the 
trophy in the Triton Tip-Off 
Tourney in front of 150 fans at 
UCSD's gym. 

"We figure we're going to have 
two or three good spurts evcl)' 
game where we can dominate 
the game," Warriors head coach 
Bob Thomason said. "If we can 
stay awake during the slow parts 
we'll be all right" 

It was the Tritons who seemed 
to fall asleep after forging a 45-
42 lead at the half on the 
strength of David Marguiles' 
three-pointer with fives seconds 
left. Stanislaus held UCSD 
scoreless for the first four 
minutes of the second half as the 
Wamors' guards dominated the 
Tritons' backcourt. Things got so 
bad at one point the Tritons 
didn't get a shot off on four 
straight possessions. 

"We gOl really good pressure 
from our guards and 1 think that 
really bothered them," Warrior 
forward Ebon Knox, the

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 

W HI LE it may have been an academic and administrative 
holiday this past weekend, trere 
was no rest for the athletes, as 
the UCSD Tritons played host to 
the Redlands Bulldogs, Cal State 
Stanislaus Warriors and 
Claremont-Mudd Stags, in 
UCSD's annual basketball 
tournament, the Triton Tip-<>ff, 
on November 28-29. 

The Tritons (2-2) were coming 
off of a terrible loss to Occidental 
College las! Tuesday as they 
faced the Bulldogs Friday in the 
Hrst game. 
By the end of the game, 
Kamansky and Ba kens had 
combined for a tOlal of 42 points 
and 6'10" junior Andy Jedynak 
had 14 rebounds as the Tritons 
topped the Bulldogs, 75-72. 

After the game, Triton Head 
Coach Tom Marshall. although 
pleased with the Wtn, was 
disappointed in the score . "I 
d Idn 't expect it to be so close . 
Their defense is tough, perhaps 
one of the tOughest we'll sec . Our 
offense wem into two or three-
minute spaces where they 
couldn 't score. especially in the 
second half, and that hun us. 1m 

B-ball 
Continued from page 12 

The Warriors did their best 10 
self-destruct after their outburst 
going almost five minutes ' 
without scoring. But during the 
dryspell UCSD could only get to 
WIthin four points, 65-61 , before 
an errant pass from Saintignon 
led to a Fuller lay-up that ended 
the Stanislaus drought. 

The Tritons, who shOl 60 
. percent in their win over 
Redlands in the first round 
Friday night, had to rely on the 

,outSide shots of Greg Kamansky 
(2 for 11 from the field), Brian 
Baokens (9 of 14, 24 points), 
and Saintignon (4 of 11) against 
the Warriors while shooting only 
44 r.ercem from the floor. 

UCSD, whose record dropped 
to 2-2, also lost the game inside . 
Riding the strength of Junior 
center Kevin Alexander's 12 
rebounds, the Warriors easily 
outboarded UCSD, 37-24. 
Alexander proved tOO much to 
handle for UC center Andy 
Jedynak (despite gIving up five 
Inches) as he pulled in several 
key offensive boards that led to 
most of his nine points. The 
Tritons were led by Kamansky, 
who pulled down six rebounds 
from his guard position. 

"We've been hurt inside 
against evel)' team we've played 
so far this year," Marshall said. 
"We can't exist on our outSide 
shootlng, although we're trying to 
now. It JUSt won't last." 

"Alexander was the difference 
1nsidt," Thomason SIfid, "I did 
not think their 6'10" player 
Oedynak) made much of an 
impact." 

The Tritons had possession 
and got to within seven points 
with 4:20 left (70-63), but 
Saintignon missed the front end 
of a one and one . Knox then 
went on a personal spurt of his 
own and scored six down the 
stretc h to ice the game for 
Stanislaus. 

"The loss definitely hurts us," 
Marshall said. "They're a Division 
III team and we need aU the 
Division 111 wins we can get. We 
should be playing better, but we 
still haven't gelled yet." ~

What's Happening to Student Wages? 
The A.S. External Affairs lobby wants you to know that in the past several months 
UCSA. has uncovered several pay cuts. In each event, the student employees were 
not consulted prior to the cuts and in at least one instance, student employees did 
not even know about the cuts until they received their shrunken pay checks. The 
most recent wave of cuts began last june when , without even consulting with their 
union and at 8:30 am during finals week, Berkeley library workers were told their 
jobs would be downgraded, resulting in wage cuts of as much at $1.70 per hour for 
new employees. Most recently, Media Services student jobs at Riverside were PUt 
on a "rwo-tier" system under which new employees performing the same work 
were paid 5.50 an hour less than last year's workers. And dining hall employees at 
Berkeley had their pay slashed $1 .50per hour in the middle ofthe month despite a 
moratorium on pay cutS agreed to by UC Systemwide Administration. 
Why is the University doing this? 
They claim their new policies are fairer. 
Student employees have a hard time seeing what's fairer about lower wages. 
Your pay, or that of a friend or co-worker, may have already been cut and you may 
not even know it. 
UCSA is fighting to p rotect your paycheck. In fact , where UCSD has been informed 
of a covert wage cut, we have been successful in restori ng the affected students pa y, 
including obtaining back pay. But we can 't right these wrongs unless we know 
about them. That's why we've instituted the "Pay Check." Call your Campus 
Employee Relations Coordinator or the UCSD Sacramento Office to find out more 
about how you can help save student pay. For more information caD: Erik Basil 
534-4450.

provide a role model ," he said . 
"It's unfortunate that women and 
minorities at UC don't have 
many role models ." 

To ensure that all the new 
chancellors wIll not be white 
males, the UCSA has considered 
plaCing an advertisement in the 
The Chronicle of Higher Education 
calling for women and minority 
applicants. 

According to Kirk Knutsen, 
UCSA Associate Director for 
Legislative Affairs, the association 
will take steps to help the 
University overcome 
institutionalized sexism and 
racism . 

' You don't see women called 
'honey' anymore ," he said , "but 
subtle and UnIntentional barriers 
still hinder the retention and 
advancement of women and 
minori!ies. 

"It's nothing overt or 
intentional, but people need to 
be sensitized to the problem ," 
Knutsen said . 

"Women and mino rities 
should not be just tolerated, but 
made an integral part of the 
University fam ily." 

UCSA ~m also work to 
decrease the amount of fees 
students pay, said Lofgren, who 
called policymakers 
"shortsighted" regarding money. 

Increased fees are driving 
people into more lucrative fields 
(so tha t they can pay for their 
education) and nOt into public 
service or the non-profit sector, 
he said. 

"This is going to hurt society 
in the longrun ," Lofgren 
said. ~

Burglars 
Continued from page 3 
area , were arrested for auto 
burglary, conspiracy to commit 
burglary, and possession of 
stolen goods. Two stereos with 
removed serial numbers were 
seized from the suspects' car. 

Mot Van Duong. the adult 
suspect, has already had a case 
issued against him by the 
District Attorney. Request 
petitions are beIng submitted to 
juvenile court for the other four. 

Sergeant Bob Jones of the 
campus police suggested that 
university campuses frequently 
expenence problems with car 
burglaries because they are more 
affluent communities with oceans 
of cars. SDSU has recently 
suffered an outbreak of 30 
burglaries. Burglars appear to 
prefer busier locations because, 
allhough it may seem more risky, 
they are actually bei ng rrotected . 
The constant motion 0 people 
and cars in the parking lots 
combined with the burglar's 
casual manner make him almost 
entirely unnoticeable , according 
to Jones. 

jones recommended that the 
campus community be more 
aware of what is happening in 
the parking lots, and that 
individuals call the campus 
police if things don't look right. 
More personally, he advised 
owners to lock their cars , put 
them in large parking lots , and 
invest in a car alarm. Although 
the alarm may not prevent a 
broken window, it will protect 
the stereo ~
