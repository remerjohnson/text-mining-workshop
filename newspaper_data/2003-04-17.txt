wording of the recommendation helt! that

A.S. against parking loss 
Resolutions oppose elimination of'S' spaces 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council unanimously 
issued resolutions expressi ng 
opposition to both the projected 
elimination of I, I 03 "5" parking 
spaces and the potential abolition 
of freshman resident parking on 
April 9. 

The resolutions come in the 
wake of a Feb. 5 report made by 
Transportation Policy Committee 
A.S. representative Tom 
Chapman, announcing that I, I 03 
"S" spaces are to be displaced by 
April 2004, in order to make 
room for the construction and 
expansion of five campus facili-
ties. Chapman reported that as a 
result, the TPC would be dis-
cussing the prospect of e liminat-
Ing freshman resident parking, in 
addition ro other measures that 
could curtail demand for parking 
and increase campus parking 
space ~upply. 

The TP aJvises the vice 
chancellor of busine s affair on 
the state of UCSD's tran porta-
uon services and facilities, and 
consists of student, faculty, staff 
and administration representa-
tives. 

In response to the elimination 
of "S" pace, the A.S. resolution 
argues that "the undergraduate 
tudents at UC D should have an 

opportunity to work, commute to 
and park on campus that is equal 
to the opportunity held by gradu-
ate students , medical students, 
faculry and staff," while the reso-
lution in support of freshman 
parking deems it "inappropriate to 
re trlCt freshman parking without 
first a nempting other mea ures to 
adequately compensate for the 
elimination of 1,103 '5' parking 
spaces. " 

"Academics and student life are 
at the core of our resolutions," 
said Muir College freshman sena-
tor Nam Sui . "Parking affects aca-
demics and student life ... We 
don't exactly live in a college 
town." 

Bui co-fou nd ed th e AII-
Campus Parking Strike Force, a 
snldent committee established to 
raise support for parking issues, 
in mid-February. T he strike force 
will most likely organize a stu-
dent demonstration in response 
to the elimination of "s" spaces 
and the possible restriction of 
freshman resident parking during

Displaced spaces: Parking spaces could be denied for freshman liVing on 
campus. An additional 1,103 '5' spaces Will be removed due to construction. 

sixth or seventh week, according 
to Bui . 

"We want more '5' spaces and 
alternative means of transporta-
tion, but at the same time, we 
want to preserve freshman park-
ing," Bui said. 

Chapman will present the A.S. 
resolutions to the TPC at a 
future meeting. The TPC has yet 
to determine how to compensate 
for the projected loss of "5" 
spaces, in part because the deci-
sion is dependent on the number 
of studen ts that enroll at UC D 
for next year, according to 
C hapman . 

The A.S. resolution in 
response to the eliminatio n of "s" 
spaces calls upon the TPC to 
uphold its charge to the commit-
tee, arguing that for the TPC to 
"renect a fair and neutral process 
that respects the needs of the con-
stituencies served by the campus 
parking and transportation sys-
tem" - a tated in its charge - it 

must not eliminate "S" spaces 
while leaving "A" and "B" spaces 
intact. 

The resolution al 0 urges the 
TPC to consider its charges to 
"be sensitive to and consider 
effects on the quality of life in 
the off-campus community," and 
to " foster judicious allocation of 
land devoted to parking facili-
ties" when examining the effects 
of the displacement of "5" 
spaces. 

"What we're trying to empha-
size is the elimination of' 'spaces 
and freshman ·parking contradicts 
the charge of the [TPC)," Bui 
said. 

Transportation and Parking 
ervices Director and Executive 

Secretary of the TPC Greg Snee 
was unavailable for comment. 

Members of the Parking trike 
Force will present the re o lu tion 
to the college councils this week 
to garner more support, according 
to Sui.

Last year, 52 vehicles were

a 100 percent increase trom the year

Despite the increase, CSO

"Even with this - I guess you 
could call it a crime wave - we 're

Those who spoke 
at A.S. meeting 
showed courage 

April 16's A .. Council meeting was 
mar~ed by remar~abl.e display of courage. 
DUring the public tnput se sion of the 

~ee~ng, members of several student orga-
nlzatJons gathered and made their collec-
ti~e voice heard, speaking on the campus 
clImate. 

tudents filed forward and shared stories 
of repression, harrassment and gross racism 
that they had experienced while on campus. 
Many were near tears as they declared that 

th~y did not feel safe here. While many al 0 
aid that the voices of minority students on 

campus were silenced during last week's 
A .. elections, their voice were most defi-
nitely not silenced at that meeting. On a 
campus that IS kn?wn for its abundant apa-
t~y, It was refi-eshi.ng to see students so pa -
~Ionate about an .Issue - especially one as 

Importan~ as th!s one. Hopefully, these 
vOices WIll contInue to grow and incite 
change for the problems of our campus cli-
mate. 

Through all of these courageou storie, 
there was one student who stood out in 
bravery. Thurgood Marshall College 

ophomore enator JeffLe, who al 0 served 
on the A.S. Elections Committee joined the 
public input eSSlOn and def~nded the 
mtegrity of the committee and elections 
manager Robin helton. It was Le who 
wro~e th~ dissenting opinion in Friday'S di -
guallficaoon of Students First!, yet he still 
stood by the integrity of the committee in 
the face of emotional opposition. 

Le's words were courageous because 
because it was preceded by over an hour of 
angry stu~ents. voic!ng their displeasure 
over the disqualification of tudents First!. 
Throughout the previous public input, stu-
de.nts often portrayed the elections com-
mittee as haV1ng bended the bylaws in an 
effort to silence minorities on campus. The 
words were delivered with such emotion 
and pas ion that it took true courage for Le 
to stand up and defend a body with which 
he didn't necessarily agree. To look a large 
group of students in the eye and tell them 
that their claims are unfounded and that 
they weren't cheated took a lot of courage, 
and for that we applaud Le.

Academic freedom must be maintained 
Classrooms need impartiality and integrity 

By DUSTIN FRELICH 
Staff Writer 

A UC Berkeley law professor and 
the UC preSIdent are seeking ro 
undermine students' political opin-
Ions. ThIS attempt to mfringe upon 
students' rights comes as the result of 
a colla bora tion between former 
UC 0 Chancellor Richard Atkinson, 
now the UC president, and UC 
Berkeley law professor Robert Post. If 
the twO have their way, professors will 
more ea ily have the ability to rurn 
their classes into stages for political 
per uasion . 

Traditionally, academic freedom 
on campus has been protected by 
statements known as academic free-
dom statements, generally accepted 
by instiruoons of higher educauon. 
The Amencan AsSOCIation of 
UniverSIty Professors has such a col-
lection of St3 tements, and so does the 

UCryHem.TheUC~offia~stare­

that student will not be subjected to

theIr mstructors, no matter the cli-
mate. 

BUI in thl time of war, Atkinson 
and POSt are attempting to relinquish 
profes onal oversight from the UC 
AcademIC Freedom statemenllt, per-
haps to lessen the degree to whIch 
professor are responSIble for their

Conversely, an official acaderntc

"Institutions of hIgher education are

"1 believe the univerSIty's stance on 
academic freedom should reflect the 
modern university and ils faculty," 
Atkinson said, referring to the decision 
to modify the UC AcademIC Freedom 
sta temen ts. 

olndoctrination.org, a nonprofit 
organization seeking to put education 
before political agenda, critiCIzes 
Atkinson for choosing to remove key 
academic freedom statements frol11

And yet there are two more Impor-

Atkinson/Post proposal. One oncertls

Lynch heroic, but not a hero 
Media obsessing over wrong issue 

Anti~drug ads are a 
source of entertainment 

By SARAH HASSAINE 
Staff Writer 

I dare you to approach anyone 
and ask, "Who is'Jessica Lynch?" 
You wi ll get a more thorough 
answer than if you asked "Where 
is Iraq?" For those of you who are 
really detached from worldly 
news, she is the 19-year-old 
P.O.W. who was "miraculously" 
rescued from the Iraqis, after hav-
ing suffered fractures in both her 
legs, her right arm and a wound to 
her head. 

Private First Class Jessica 
Lynch, a upply clerk, is stated to 
have shot several Iraqi soldicrs, 
and continucd to fire until she ran 
out of ammunition in an ambush 
on March 23 . After having suf-
fered injuries, she was taken to an 
Iraqi hospital and was later found 
by American troops. 

Within seconds, Lynch is 
ntrned into a heroine - the new 
American symbol to place on a 
pedestal and show off to the 
world. The media is focusing on 
every aspect of her recovery and 
of her family's reactions. 

Ever ince she was found, her 
family has held countless press 
conferences and interviews with 
the media . 

The journalists have not failed 
to report to the public how Lynch 
has finally had the apple sauce she 
had been craving, and that her 
other favorite foods include 
turkey and carrots. They inform 
us daily when she talks to her fam-
Ily, and whether she h~ts "high 
spirits," or is feeltng "groggy." 
There are Web sites that allow 
people to donate gifts to her and 
her family and even donate money 
toward her future education. 

One espeCially interesting site 
is a ballad written In her honor to 
the nine of "Davy Crockett." At 
the end of every stanza are lines 
that apply to her, such as, "So she 
houlder her rifle an' off she 

goes' Jessica, Jessica Lynch, the 
girl sure showed no fear!" 
Another personal favorite line is: 
"Jcs Ica, Je sica Lynch, Queen of 
the IraqI Campaign!" 

Basically, Lynch ha become a 
"queen" in the eyes of the 
American media. She represents 
the American that will go to any 
length for her country, even if it 
means risking her life. She is the 
symhol of courage, perseverance, 
wen"rth and survival. The fact 
tim ~he b fresh Out of high school 

COMMENTARY 
and harbors simple dreams of 
becoming a kindergarten teacher 
after serving her country, immedi-
ately render her a teenage marty!' 
and an inspiration to all. 

I am not disputing the fact that 
she is strong. And I am happy tha t 
she is currently getting the need-
ed medical treatment and has 
been reunited with her family. I 
admire her will and she definitely 
de ervcs recognition, but didn't 
the media talee it JUSt a little too 
far? 

After the ambu h, up to about 
a week ago, there were always 
updates on her condition with 
most news broadcasts, followed by 
a bnef clip of her parents talking 
and then an image of the anchors 
cO'nversing among themselves, yet 
again, about how "miraculous" 
her recovery is. 

Putting aside the fact that the 
American media is doing a very 
poor job in objectively reporting 
the war in Iraq , my question is: 
What did they expect? 

ThIS IS war, and therefore 
there arc bound to be casualties 
on both sides. It IS inevitable to 
have troops missing or suffering 
from wounds. The media acted as 
though Lynch is the only person 
witl1 a story, with a life to risk, and 
the only person fighting this war. 

o one ordered Lynch to 
etHer the Army. No one forced 
her to pick up a gun and fight. he 
made that conscious decision her-
self and I am sure that she was 
aware of the chance of getting 
injured and possibly not making it 
home. 

Other live have been lost, and 
while the United States doe 
report 011 American soldiers, they 
hardly attribute the same kind of 
attention to them a they do to 
Lynch . They are doing an insuffi-

cien! job of reporting any Iraqi 
casualties. Many Iraqis have died 
- people of all ages - and hospi-
tals are overcrowded with the 
wounded. 

She was rescued, but who is 
rescuing everyone else? 

It also makes you wonder 
whether the exact ame hype 
would have been contrived if the 
private rescued would have been 
an African-American, an Asian or 
from another marginalized group. 
It's doubtful. Lynch fits the 
American image and the media is 
going to make a Sl2r of her. 

Just last week, local news sta-
tions reported that television sru-
dios were already arguing over 
who would have the rtghts to 
making a movie of her story; I 
love how we waste no time. 

In Iraq now, as journalist 
Thomas Friedman reported, the 
nation has no running water, no 
food , and growing insecurity. If 
the purpose of this war was to 
"liberate" the Iraqis and bring 
them to a state of democracy, the 
United tates still has a huge 
mountain to climb before they 
can slide down without regretting 
the initial first step. 

Presently, according to 
Friedman, the conditions in [raq 
are beyond conceivable. Friedman 
describes the Umm Qasr 
Ilospital: "A woman who deliv-
ered a baby an hour earlier is 
limping home, and her mother 
has the baby rucked under her 
black robe. An old orange Dodge 
speeds up and a malnourished 
teenage boy moans on the back 
seat. little kid is playing WIth an 
X-ray film of someone's limb. In 
the hospital lab, the ink i piled 
WIth bloody test rubes, waiting to 
be washed when the wa ter comClJ 
back on." 

These surely are nor images 
that the U.S. media wantS to show 
to the American public. Instead, 
they continue to flood American 
liVing rooms with photOs of 
Lynch, in order to show u the 
exemplary ch~racters that make 
up our nation, and to render us 
proud of our actions in the inter-
national community. 

I think our nation's media 
should consider focusing on other 
aspects of the war and other lives 
that arc affected, and get over 
Lynch. he chose to fight and she 
i not the only person right now 
who is suffering as a co t or thi 
war.

Bertrand Fan 

I was watching Vl-I-I's "I Love '80s" show and they ~howed thi anti-drug public service 
announcement from 19 7. 

You mayor may not remember 
it - it starts off with a father com-
ing into his son's room with a cigar 
box full of weed. "Your mother 
found this in your closet," he said. 
Apparently in the world of antidrug 
PSAs, kids don't own anything but 
cigar boxes. There's nothing else in 
their rooms that could, at any time, 
hold drugs. The on then starts to 
give the standard excu e of, "It's not 
mine, it's this other guy's." 

I remember once, in lOth grade, 
we were hanging out at my friend's 
house when his mom came in 
because apparently we had left an 
eighth on the kitchen counter. My 
friend then made up this Story about 
how we were all just hangmg out, 
and then this guy who no one was 
really friends with came over and 
apparently forgot his baggie of weed. 
I believe his name was supposed to 
be Fred. I left quite qUIckly after that 
and my friend got grounded for a 
month, but the POlllt is that as lame 
as it sounded, it was the best excuse 
afforded to us at the time. 

The dad then cuts off the son 
and says, "\\'here did you'learn to 
do this?" The son doesn'r say any-
thing, and the dad repeats, "\\'here 
did you learn to do this?" and then 
the son startS crying and says, " I 
learned it from you l Iitanud 1/ fi'07n 
watchmg you!" 

All in aU, it was very toucrung. N, 
you started to cry from this amazing 
display of human relationships, I 
believe it faded out and said some-
thing like, "Learn to hide your drug 
use better. Especially if you're a par-
ent." After I saw that and fini hed 
humming "Memories ... from the 
way we were," I thought about anti-
drug PSAs and how, a frer all this 
time, they still suck ass. I mean, who 
the hell are these people that create 
these P As? I get the feeling that the 
extent of their research on teenagers 
and drugs consists of watching that 
episode of Punky Brew ter where 
she can be in the cool kids club if he 
docs speed and crack. 

There's another thing I want to 
know: INhere are these people that 

a) give you free drugs, and b) will 
only be your friend if you do the 
free drugs that they give you? All 
the drug users I know would wel-
come a straIght fflend with open 
arms, becau e they need someone 
to drive them to In- -OUI or pick 
up one of the many varietIes of 
Visine from Earl's Place. 

And why don't I know any sixth 
graders wi th crack? I low do sixth 
graders buy crack? Do they save up 
their allowance from tl1ird to ixth 
grade only to use it as leverage 10 
get people to be friends with them' 

The latest trend of anti-drug 
P5As are divided into two cate-
gories, terrorism and bad judg-
ment. The first one is sort of back-
firing in my opinion. It attemptS to 
how a link between terrorism dnd 

drug money, and everybody with an 
IQ over 75 eerns to recogni7..c that 
the link itself is the fact that drugs 
are illegal. 

The other category, bad judg-
ment, seems to be a series of com-
meraals that whine about the fact 
that you're more likely l() put Ollt 
when you're high. Thank you, 
Captain ObVlou . I thtnk "c should 
address the fact though that mO'>t 
girls at parnes that are hIgh Jre 31 0 
drunk off thel r a.51>CS. 

Look, you want to make an effec-
tive anti-drug P A? You take a "deo 
camera, go downtown and film ome 
of the people I nUl Into on my lunch 
break. 1 was walkmg down 
Broadway, and this lanl-'Y black guy 
pauses mid-step, runs dOIl'n a ,Ide 
street and says, "I just wanted to tell 
you that you smell good" to a bWlCh 
of girls and tI,en comes back. 

0, of cour e, I started laughlllg 
my ass off. lie took my laughter as 
an invitation to talk to me about his 
life for the next five mlnute~ . lie 
told me about how he "ked martial 
arts movIes but they're really expen-
sive, espeCIally at liquor stores. It 
took me a while to figure that much 
out, and by that tune, I decided to 
rurn down a street the oppo~ite 
direction of my work, so he found 
omeone else to anno},-

So you just film that guy, or the 
ones JUSt singing at the top of the,r 
lungs III the mIddle of the tnterscc-
oon, and then you I'rlle "Don't do 
drugs." Or, If you have a large bud-

UCSD has a strong tradition of 
support ing diversi ty, however, 
until now the campus' definition 
of diversity has been rather limit-
ed. UCSD needs to ackl10wl edge 
the religious diversity of its snl-

plays in many students' lives. I 
apfllaud the universi ty'S efforts to

Speakers at the rally addressed 
me need for opposition to hate 
crimes at UCSD. 

"Somebody thinks it's oleay to 
post up flyers with the KKK on 
our campus," said Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore 
Moneek Bhatia. "This is a hate-
free zone. We don 't need any of 
that." 

The rally keyed in upon other 
events the supporters found to be 
hateful. Bhatia spoke about how 
supporters of the lesbian , gay, 
bisexua l and transgender commu-
nity were allegedly harassed at me 
"Day of Silence" event on April 9 
by orner srudents . Anti -war pro-
testers on Library Walk were also 
harassed, Bhatia said. 

Ethnic studies professor George 
Lipsitz stated that it is me members 
of the university who are obligated 
to educate me ca mpus communi ty 
about racial tolerance. 

"The people who are commit-
ting these hate cri mes ... have not 
been around enough people of 
color, enough gays and Ie bians, 
enough people to kl10w what the 
world looks like," Lipstiz sa id . 
"They are provincial, they are 
parochial and we're not goi ng to 
hate - we're going to educate." 

Other speakers at the event 
included the Freedom Writers,

Ilsu and 1arshall fifth-year Denise

A.S. ELEOIONS IN TURMOIL 

Students First!: Students feel threatened on campus 
continued from page I 

Daniel Gonzales spoke at the A .. 
Council meeting and brought in 
nvcr that he said he found on cam-

r~s dUring the campaign period. 
According to Gonzales, these flyers 
were not posted by nldents First!, 
but u,ed their late's name . Under 
the late logo, the flyer read, 
"\ VI-lite people arc el;1 and racist." 

"There's a lot that happened 
that you jusr don't know about," 
,onzales said. "At three o'clock in 

the mornmg, I came to the Pnce 
Center after I was called." 

According to Gonzales, It 11'3, 
then that he found everal of the 
nyers. One flrcr, Gon7..Jles aId, 
was covering the AS. Councd \\ eb-
cam. lIe tore all the nyers down 
Gonzales says he lOre down such 
nyers on two eparate occa~ions; 
and on one occasIon he was 
approached by a manger. 

"A man came up to mc who 
knew m\, name; who knew the 
room and the building that I livc Ill , 
and demanded that I gi"e them 
back to lum," Gonz.1les said. "I 
walked awa\, from him and told him 
t\\ Ice to top following me and he 
would not stop follomng mc." 

GOIl7.ale said he artempted to 
file a report with the police, but he 
was informed that there was noth-
mg to be done at that time. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
ophomore senator Jeff Le spoke 

about bemg a part of this year's A .. 
Elections Committee and trying to 
run a fair and honorable election. 
Le, the A.S. representatil'e to the 
elecuons comrruttee, wrote the dls-
senung opinion for the resolution 
that disqualified the Snldents FlrStl 
slate. 

"I want to say thiS; that every 
slllgie member of the electIons 

lyon Uew/Guardian 
Concerned: Dunng the publiC Input portion of the April 16 meeting of the AS. Counal, many students voiced their dismay over 
aJITent campus ISSUes, such as the AS. Eled10n Committee's ruhng to disqualify the Students First! slate and recent hate inadents. 
committee was 100 percent unbi-
ased," Le said. "1 want to say that 
these people that I worked with for 
many weeks; 1 tru~t their Judgment. 
And Just because I dId nOt agree 
with what they deCIded, they are 
still people with good honor and 
integrl ry. " 

Le said that due to recent mis-
understandings, he felt the need to 
defend the honor of the election 

committee, and of the elections 
manager, Robin Shelton. 

Perse 1 looper, the tudents 
Fir t! candidate for commis ioner 
of academic affai rs, criticized the 
procedural proce se of the election 
commIttee hearmgs. 

"I'm here to talk ab.out the pro-
cedures during the hearings. They 
were so incredibly nawed," 1 looper 
aid. "To have a hearing that is 

compiled of people that are chosen 
from their respective colleges to act 
as judge and jury; that doe n't make 
any kind of sense." 

Hooper said rhat she felt that 
her slate was considered guilty by 
the elections committee until it 
could prove its innocence. She 
also said lhat she felt there was 
not enough control over the par-
tiCIpants during the hearings, and 

that the mediator was insuffi-
ciem. 

At the April 16 rally in Price 
Center, ethnic studies professor 
George Lipsitz spoke about the 
recent election during a speech 
condcmning hate crimes. lIe 
ap'peared to consider the disqualifi -
cation to bc a part of a larger prob-
lem. 

"The people who are commit-
ting these hate crimes; the people 
who tell you that when you won ,10 
election, you didn't win it ... they 
haven 't been around enough people 
of color, they haven 't been around 
enough gays and lesbian , they 
haven 't been around enough pcople 
to know what they world looks 
like," he said . 

Lipstiz was followed by Ihe 
Students First! presidential candi-
date, Kevin Shawn Ii su. Though 
KeVIn hawn I-hu said that he was 
not interested in speaking about the 
recent election, he did reveal hi~ 
anger regarding the results . 

Kevin Shawn Ilsu cho e to 
speak generally about being a stu-
dent of color, and what he felt are 
implicit implications of hi~ cthniCl-
ry when trying to entcr ~tudenl 
government. 

"What does it mean to be a stu-
dent of color?" Shawn II u said. "It 
mean that when you trive to enter 
the spaces of power on our campus, 
that it's going ro he ,\ truggle." 

Kevin Shawn Hsu touched upon 
his personal expericnces as a tudent 
of color and running for office 

" 0 one should face a struggle 
like we have faced . No one should 
face the blatant hate that wc have 
seen in the past twO weeks," he said. 

Other speakers at the rally did 
not address the issue of the recent 
election. 

Report: Maj. opinion stated slate held 'disregard' for previous ruling 
continued from page I 

qualify the slate was split 4-3 . The 
report, however, sta ted tha tall 
members of the elections commit-
tee had agreed that a posting VIO-
latJon had occurred; that they had 
each wItnessed members of the 
Students FIrst' late organized 
around the "Vote For Kevin 
Shawn Hsu (2nd on the bailor)" 
poster on LIbrary Walk the day~ 
after the Apnl 9 posting deadlrne, 
and that the slate was thus In vio-
Iallon of the committee's first 
deCISion to dIsallow Students 
Firstl posters after April 9. 

Beyond these pOlms, the mem -
bers of the committee dlffeled on

'v\'hatever their opinions are, they 
have them for a reason and you 
have to respect them," Le said. 

Le also responded to student 
reactions following the decision, 
allegrng that race was involved in 
the decision against the slate. 

"Race had nothing to do with 
this," Le aid. 

The majoriry opinion held that 
there was a "disregard" for the 
election committee's previous rul -
ing and sanction against Students 
First! . They also ex pre sed the 
view that Students First! ca ndi -
dates should have made an effon 
to take down the posters that had 
been left III vIola lion on Aprrl 10. 

"... I t I not unreasonable to 
assumc that all Individuals associ-
ated WIth the slate would have 
expressed concern to the elecuons 
manager or commmee that said

third party when confronted wllh

' [0 the question of intent , the

found that there was mtent to

acro~s campus that closely re CIll -
bled the po~tcr~ that the slate had 
been urdered to relllove," the 
report Slated. 

As to precedent, the commlt-
tec' report responded that they 
reali7cd the "gravlly of the \Ilua-
lion .. 

"/lowever, [the CCl mlllltlee) 

was compelled by the strict stance 
and observance or interpretation 
to the A.S. Elections Bylaws 
throughout this election," the 
report went on to state. " In the 
past, election comminee rulings 
and breach of bylaws have been 
widely ignored by candidates." 

In the concluding section of 
the majority report, the commit-
tee described its broader experi-
ence of the two weeks of the cam-
paigntng period . 

"This was only a small window 
into the chronic pettiness in cam-

" Whatever their opinions 
are, they have them for a 
reason and you have to 

respect that . " 
- Jeff Le, AS. representative to 
the AS. Eledions Committee 

palgning that has plagued 
UCSD," the report sta ted . 
"WItnessing th,. election from the 
A.S. Elections ommittee per-
spec live wuuld gIVe any student 
ser ious concerns about the 
proces of call1p~ lglllng on the 
UCSD campu~." 

The report went on to argue 
that the ~ Iatc'~ dcu~lon to "push 
the Imllls" of Ihe COlllmlw:e by 
nut ~tnctly follOWIng their sanc-
lion wa a "calculated ri sk." 

The maJorlry report concluded 
by sayrng that the commlttce was 
rcqulred by the bylaws lCJ give 
appo\ltc anWll11S and that dls-
(Iualificatron was therefore the 
"only v!able" form of anCllon, 

and that the committee had no 
access to the elections results until 
after their decision was taken. 

Le, who wrote the dissenting 
opinion, argued that there were 
twO ways to look at the case's evi-
dence: one being ·preponderance 
of evidence," where evidence 
shows at least 50. 1 percent of 
guilt, and the other being "beyond 
the shadow of a doubt," which he 
favored, where the elections 
would have needed 100 percent 
proof of guilt to disqualify the 
late. 

Le went on to discuss why he 
believed there was only a prepon-
derance of evidence, pointing Ollt 
thal there were no timestamps on 
wher the video or pholOgraphs of 
the posters presented by Steve 
York, who filed U1C gnevance. Le 
31 0 found U1Jt some of the pic-
tures had been available on rhe 
Students Flrst l Web site. 

I.e called the degree of seventy 
of the ofFense "questionable." 

"In Illy opinion, having three 
posters up was clearly a minor 
offense," Le wrote. 

lIe argued that It i pOSSIble 
that there could have been "hos-
tile bodies" working against the 
Students Flrst l slate in the ca e of 
the nonendorsed posters that 
remained hanging after Students 
First! members said they had 
taken all posters down, cltrng pos-

these nyers to the commlltec's 
attention at the Aprtl II hearing, 
they were dl mls cd by the COI11-
mlltee for prc)(;edural rea ~on s . 

Le also disagreed with the 
sa nction cho en; he argued that 
only those whose names had been 
found on the nonendorsed po ters 
shou ld have been disqualified . 
These included presidential can-
didate Kevin Shawn Ilsu, vice 
president finance candidate 
Harish andagopal and commis-
sioner of diversity affairs 
Stephanie Aguon. 

"This particular case is a clear 
example of how the elections 
committee lacked better abilities 
to serve the written word and the 
intent of the bylaws," Le wrote. 
"This problem terns (rom a Oaw-
filled elections bylaws."

The Association of American 
Medical Colleges filed a lawsuit 
last month against Princeton 
Review, Inc., accusing the test-
preparation company of copyright 
inFringement, misappropriation of 
trade secrets and fraud . 

The lawsuit stems from 
Princeton Review's practice of hir-
ing agents and compensating 
employces for taking the Medical 
College Admissions Test and for 
writing a comprehensive review, 
which is used in Princeron 
Review's MCAT prepararion 
courses. 

The AAMC says that such 
behavior, known as " tapping," 
injures the security of the te t 
questions and places the vaJidity of 
the exam at stake. 

"They've been stealing our 
creative work to enhance their 
bottom line," said Robert F. Jones, 
the a sociation's vice president for 
medical schools and services. 
"That's against the law." 

Like most national examina-
tions, some MCAT test questions 
are reu ed to assure consistent 
scoring and difficulty level. 

The Princeton Review says 
that it is necessary to have 
employees take the exam so that 
the company can ensure that their 
program is providing adequate 
preparation for students. 

"We don't send our employees 
in to memonze questions," said 
John Katzman, Princeton 

Review's founder and chief execu-
tive officer. "We send them in to 
learn everything we can a bout the 
test." 

Katzman conceded that some 
of his employees who took the test 
signed a document certifying their 
intention to apply to medical 
school and not to memoriz.e ques-
tions. 

"We've done nothing wrong," 
said Lynda J ulronich, director of 
the Princeton Review's San Diego 
office. 

" They've been stealing our 
creative wark to enhance 

they're bottom line. 
That's against the law." 
- Robert F. Jones, AAMC vice 

president 
Jutronich explained that she 

believes Princeton Rev;ew did not 
violate any copyright laws, 
becau e the reports that contained 
test questions were used for inter-
nal purposes only. 

The suit claims that the distri-
bution of confidential test ques-
tions can "jeopardiz.e the validity 
of resulting scores; potentially 
give some examinees an unfair 
advantage over other examinees, 
or create the appearance of such 
an advantage; and undermine the

admissions process for U.S. med-
ical schools." 

Jones made clear that at this 
point, students have not been 
affected by Princeton Review's 
alleged illegal behavior. 

"The lawsuit should have no 
impact on students," Jones said in 
an April 15 message. "Because the 
te ting material was obtained dur-
ing, not prior, to the test adminis-
tration, its exposure to the test 
preparation company's instructors 
posed no threat to the validi ty of 
scores. However, it may affect our 
plans for reuse of those items." 

While the lawsuit has the 
potential to impact testing reform 
across the nation, Princeton 
Rev;ew officials are treating the 
matter gingerly. 

"We think the MCAT is a pret-
ty good test," said Steve 
Quattrociocchi, executive vice 
president of the company's test-
preparation division . "Students 
talcing an important test have the 
right to understand what is 
expected of them." 

The lawsuit was filed in a fed-
eral court in Washington, D.C., 
and ultimately seeks an unspeci-
fied amount of damages caused by 
any illegal actions committed by 
Princeton Review. A hearing date 
has not yet been set. 

The Princeton Review prepa-
ration course for the MCAT 
costs $1,400. The exam is 
offered on two 9 II2-hour-long 
test days each year. Over 57,000 
students took the MCAT last 
year.

Clearing the 
smoke on 420 
Straight edge movement 

takes on celebrated day of 
inebriation and debauchery 

By RICHIE LAURIDSEN 
Contributing Writer 

As the calendar slowly creeps toward April 20, a date infamous for drug and alcohol binges, a certain group of people seem 
unaffected despite the "high" hysteri a. 
Though mainstream society may prepare for 
something mind-altering on this mid- pril 
day, many members of society feel only mild-
ly impacted by such an event. Instead, they are 
reminded only of their often life-long com-
minnem to abstinence from controlled sub-

, stances. This comminnent is called straight 
edge. Straight edge Itself is a Simple philoso-
phy, encouraging cri tical thinking through 
sobriety. 

"I'm a person, just like you, but I've gOt 
better things to do," said Ian MacKaye, ex-
&ononan for seminal hardcore band Minor 
Threat in the song "Straight Edge .~ 
MacKaye, currently playing with indie-rock 
heroes Fugazi, is credited fo r coinjng the 
term, and often receives credit for the move-
ment as a whole. 

The lyrics to the song, first released in the 
eady '80s, speak out the straight edge mission 
statement, commenting on the rejection of 
drug use and encourage alternatives to punk 
and independent thought - a type of thought 

stemming from Jggressive mUSIC, promoting 
pro-active comm uni ty involvement. self 
improvement and personal, independent dccl-
sion-ma.ki ng. 

This life-long commitment to temperance 
is typically spawned by one of two rea,ons: 
People either develop an Inherently bad Opin-
ion of drugs and alcohol through neganve 
reme rcement throughout their life, or imh-
vidual truggle with addlctlon lead someone 
to reject a lifestyle of rclian e on sub rances. 
and instead resort to being free of add,ction JS 
a whole. 

"It means every tiling to me." said Thomas 
Koslch, a 21-year-old who vowed to a life free 
of drugs or alcohol over four year ago. 

Ko Ich, currently plaY1llg drums for a 
straight edge hardcore band called In Your 
Face, aid that a straight edge lifestyle I an 
idea that does need expo ure In a oclety 
where drugs and alcohol are often accepted.

Californians still say 'yes' to 
medical marijuana, co-op growing 
Federal government keeps institution in legal limbo 

By KEELY HYSLOP 
Staff Writer 

I n 1996, the California tate Legislature passed Proposition 2 15, Approved by 56 percent 
of Cali fo rni a voters, Prop 215 
added to the California Health 
and Safety Code "The 
Compa sionate Use Act of 1996," 
giving physicians the legal right to 
prescribe marijuana to patients 
suffering from a variety illne es 
for which research has shown that 
mari juana provides relief. It also 
protects medicinal marijuana u ers 
and growers from criminal prose-
cution and sanction. 

One com pl ica non that arose 
from this situation was that Prop 
21 5 and similar legi sla tion In 
other states were relevant only to 
the state legislatures. Although the 
federal government passed similar 
compassionate-use legislation in 
1975, the stance of the federal 
government regarding its support 
of mediCinal marijuana after the 
1990s has been anything but solid . 
C urrently, the federal government 
has only granted seven Americans 
the legal nght to use mari juana fo r 
medicinal purpose . All o thers 
cultivating or In possession of 
manJuana are in violation of fed-
erallaw. 

T he Drug Enforcement 
Administration has recently taken 
a particularly fo rceful stance 
aga inst the legaliza tion of mari-
Juana in any fo rm, even medical. 
Although In 'ovembcr 200 1, it 

approved the usc of human test 
subjects in a study of the effects of 
smoked marijuana to be carried 
out by two researchers from 
UC 0, the official stance of the 
DEA on marijuana is still that it is 
a schedule I chemical substance 
with a high potential for abuse 
and no currently accepted medical 
use in treatment in the United 
States. 

"As a law enforcement officer, 
I am well aware of the problem 
that dangerous drugs have caused 
our society. The impact of drugs 
and drug-related violence is seri-
ously threatening our quality of 
life." said Thomas A. 
Con tan tine, Administrator of 
the DEA, in a reply to an article 
on medicinal marijuana u e in the 
JOllrnal of rht Ammcan M edicinal 
AssooarlOn. 

Cooperatives and activist orga-
nizations have sprung up all over 
California to lobby for the rights 
of patients using marijuana as a 
treatment and more controver-
sially, to aid In the cultivation and 
distribution of the plant. 
Organizations like the Women's 
Alliance for Medical Marijuana 
and San Diego's own ational 
Orgamzation for the Reform of 
M arijuana Laws are doing e"ef)'-
th ing from organizing letter cam -
paigns, to givi ng classes to 
pati ents about mari juana, to 
growing thei r own po t in large 
communal gardens often tended 
by the patients themselves. 
Despite bei ng In compliance with 

state laws and often working with 
the local police departments 
directly to insure compliance with 
regulations, many of these organi-
zations have been raided by the 
DEA. Their plants have been 
destroyed and their computers 
and offices seized . 

In October 2002, all of this 
came to a head for Steve 
McWilliams - co-director of San 
Diego's Shelter from the Storm, a 
small memcal manjuana collective 
that served six patientS. Twenty 
medicinal cannabis plants were 
taleen from his home by Federal 
Drug Administration officials, and 
he was then taken into custody 
two weeks later on marijuana cul-
tivation charges. He pleaded 
guilty to the charges, but the case 
created a great stir of outrage 
within the medicinal cannabis 
supporting community. 

"This prosecution raises seri-
ous questions about the misuse of 
federal power to try to silence a 
vocal critic of federal policy," said 
NORML Executive Director 
Keith Stroup. 

In ovemher 2002, a federal 
court ruled that physicians can 
discuss the pro and cons of medi-
cinal marijuana use without fllcing 
sanctions from the DEA. A viable 
solution to the rug-of-war pla!,ru-
ing medicinal marijuana users 
between the desire of the state to 
aid chronically ill patients and the 
desire of the U , . government to 
win the war against drugs has yet 
to be found.

X420X: Straight edgers 
embrace abstinence, positivity 

continued from page I I 
In finding a place to expres these 
ideas, Kosich turned to music, 
because music was the place that he 
found refuge from this societal 
trap. 

Playing music becomes a com-
mon type of expression for people 
trying to communicate a message 
about societal change as a whole; 
more specifically, punic music was a 
form of expression that not only 
promoted a message, but was easi ly 
accessible as well. 

Spencer Gooch, a long-time 
volunteer at the Che Cafe 
Collective, is a big advocate of the 
critical th in king and positive 
changes that punk music can 
encourage. 

"After the initial decision [to 
become abstinentl, a lot more 
thought went into it," he said. "To 
me, straight edge is a way to sub-
vert all the tactics that tobacco 
giants and alcohol moguls use to 
perpetuate a cycle of addiction. It 
may sound like rhetoric, but that's 
what those companies do. Straight 
edge allows me to make an immedi-
ate difference in my community." 

This type of proactive attitude 
helps maintain the strength and sta-
bility that the straight edge lifestyle 
representS. Whde punk music a a 
whole started as a rejeccion of main-
stream culture, the punk movement 
still had ties to drug use and basic 
types of personal defiance. 

"The traight edge hardcore 
movement really seems like a rejec-
cion of that initial rebellion. People 
concinued to take things one step 
further ... rejecting drug use 
became another form of rebellion," 
Kosich said . 

In a society with holidays like St. 
Patrick's Day, ultimately devoted to 
Inebriation , and the upcoming 

events of 420, it seems like the defi-
ance found in a straight edge 
lifestyle couldn't be any more valid. 

"Live and let live," Kosich said, 
regardi ng the custom of inebriation 
in our culture around this time of 
the year. Like many straight edgers, 
Ko ich is a firm believer that the 
decision of sobriety is a personal 
one; there's no hidden agenda of 
converting those who aren't 
Straight edge. 

"I don't like being told to drink, 
so I'm not going to tell someone 
not to," Gooch said. "To me, 
straight edge is a personal decision 
.. . focused nO[ on denying yourse lf 
something, but on the fact that you 
don't want it in the first place." 

The abstinence embodied by 
the straight edge movement 
revolves more around staying posi-
tive th an around the seemingly 
constant societal obsession with an 
altered state of mind. 

"Few can argue that the philos-
ophy is no longer valid. The drug-
free lifestyle has left itS positive 
impact on more than onc wayward 
youth," said Srra;ghr-Edguom, a 
site devoted to offering different 
types of information about the 
movement as a whole. 

"They're positive ideas that 
people need to hear," Kosich aid . 
" I'm saddened that pcople have to 
rely on [drugs and alcohol] ... it just 
becomes a crutch ." 

Though the straight edge move-
ment aims to be a social reform, in 
no way does it require conver ion, 
The movement has no miSSIOn 
statement, and as a whole still 
maintains its title as a personal 
comminment; though to somc chi 
may mean just an o ther side of 
sobriety, to others it can be a life-
long expression of the most impor-
tant part of their life .

It's high time to put down the bong 
What is with this Istoner holiday'? Is this still UCSD?

Rinaldo Donnan 
, F ew substances have as prominent a place 

in American culture as marijuana with 
anything from subtle to overt references 

in m usic, television, movies and just about any-
where; the once socially unacceptable act of 
smoking pot has taken a rather public place in 
our collective psyche. Clearly, this does not 
thri II everyone, and some have talcen direct 
action against the hundreds of thousands of 
people who are lighting up all the time. Yet for 
most, even those who don't themselves burn 
one now and again, getting high is hardly a 
reason to freak out. 

Admittedly, seeing a 420 issue in a self-
respecting paper like this (stop laughing) only 
points to how accepti ng we

vised section of the parking lot for a while and 
return a little gigglier then before. I assumed 
nothing, but noticed that tlley had this "4:20" 
on their person in some form or another, so I 
decided to just up and ask what it meant. 

"Its time to smoke pot," my droopy-eyed 
classmate responded, as though that in itself 
was explanation enough. I was, however, left 
with little cleared up, and many, many more 
questions about this oddly ritua listic notion 
of intoxicating o ne's self. Why the need to 
specify a time? Isn't any time a good time for 
a Mi ller? Why then is 4:20 the right time to 
get high? When you get right down to it, no 
o ne really knows. Sure there are the stories 
about a group of central California kids who 
were searching for a lost grove of free-grow-
ing marijuana, but that really speaks nothing 
about why and how it caught on with such 
universal appeal and acceptance of meaning. 
Furthermore, no one really seems to care, 
unless they themselves don't smoke and 
remain baffled by the whole experience. In 
general, where and who is smoking deter-

mine a good dea l about the 
have become to the discussion 
of people taking a green, 
sometimes white, sometimes 
purple, hopefully not brown, 
sticky plant, smoking it and 
then sitting around and trying 
to make sense of Dark Side Of 
The Mooll as played in sync 
with "The Wizard Of Oz," or 
building a bong out of your 
coffee table. 

Many popular forms of 
music have a sub-genre that is 
centered on the production of 
music done on and meant for 
you to apprccia te on "the 
weed." There is toner rock, 
of which Queens Of The 
Stone Age have gained promi-

If 1 had a dime bag 
for every time 1've 

stumbled on a group 
of people casually 

srrwking out in plain 
view I weU, 1 would 
be a very popular 

formality of marijuana. Some 
people only smoke joints, 
whi le others are strictly bong 
people. I've heard that some 
will be offended by being 
passed a partially smoked 
pipe and can only accept get-
cing a fresh "packing." A 
friend once told me that he 
and his buddies adopted the 
no shoes rule from "Half 
Baked." 

Ironically, it is pot's very 
illegality that makes it so read-

and would-be carpenters of all 
ages. No 16-year-old is going

nence, hydro-grind (referring to hydroponical-
ly grown marijuana) out of heavy metal, much 
of reggae, most of rap (with Dr. Dres seminal 
album Tbt Chronic, among so many others), 
and these are just the more direct develop-
ments of musics more recent shapes. There 
are certainly older songs, fowld III early blues, 
which could be read as having just a little to do 
with reefer, and of course witll groups like 
Black abbath, it all became a little less veiled; 
I mean, " weet Leaf," that is such a stretch to 
make a drug reference. 

So sure, molang pot has been around for 
quite sometime, but when did we become so 
... blase about it all? With the legalization 
movement, one can sec that the ball gOt 
roiling a while back, hut 1 can actually 
remember when the marijuana culture 
seemed to seep into my awareness: I wa a 
junior in high school, and I started seeing all 
these lads who scrawled "4:20" on their back-
packs. Finall)" I took auto shop, where some 
of the kids would go down to the un uper-

from their dealer, but if they 
were trying to get one of these 40s the lcids are 
so crazy about, they might actually have to 
become resourceful and get someone else to do 
their dirty work for them. Since illegal drugs 
have no regulation, this means that anyone 
who has the money and knows a supplier can 
get down. The end result is that you don't have 
to look very hard for very long before you 
rumble across a stoner, even here at UCSD. 

Considering how prevalent the use of marijua-
na is, take a look arowld in your next large 0-
chem/econ/math cla.ss; someone probably has 
a couple of baggies they could sell you. Or next 
time you're walking through the Srudent 
Center, keep your eyes and nose open; If I had 
a dime bag for every time I've stumbled on a 
group of people casually smoking out in plain 
view, well, I would be a very popular student. 
Our fellow srudents must be down right 
brazen, or maybe they've JUSt smoked enough 
to not care, but tile number of people who 
have no problem lighting a doobie as they walk 
to class never ceases to amaze me.

Rock monsters Zwan to rock RIMAe 
(organ and com-

pany show they are 
no rats in a cage 

By BILLY GIL 
Staff Writer 

Billy Corgan is like the bad kid In clas . You can chastise him all you want, but it won't be 
long before he'~ pulling on your 
arm, a king you for a new crayon. 
Mereh month after the 2000 dis-
solution of the mashing 
Pumpkin , Corgan began record-
ing ne\\ song with little more 
than the mOlliker that came to hIm 
while v3catlorung In Ital~" Zwan. 

ow a full-fledged five-piece rock 
monster, Zwan makes i~ round 
to an Diego for the second time 
when it plays RL\lAC Arena on 
April 2l. 

The Smashing Pumpkins was 
one of the most fascinatingly Idio-
syncratic bands of their time. Its 
unique brand of grandio e rock 
bombast won them both legions of 
diehard fans and jeers from skep-
tics, peaking commercially In the 
mid- '90s with hits like "Today" 
and "19 9." As the years wore on, 
the Pumpkins faced a string of 
internal problems including drug 
abuse, messy breakups and the 
death of their touring keyboardist. 
They went on to record two final, 
underappreciated albums but were 
rebuked by fans and the press for 
straying too far from their original 
sound.

Zwln-sonr: Corgan and rock supergroup Zwan will bring their expansive, colorful 
sound to UCSD on Monday April 21. Zwan has escaped the Pumpkins' shadow. 

Once the Pumpkins broke up, 
Corgan and drummer Jimmy 
Chamberlain agreed to work 
together again after tiling at least 
a year off. After three months, 

Corgan, Chamberlain and gui-
tarist Matt Sweeney were writing 
and rehearsing new music under 
the name Zwan. Sweeney and 
Corgan were longtime friends and 
mutual admirers of each other's 
music (Sweeney fronted the indie 
guitar bands Slrunlc. and Chavez) 
and had long before promised to 
work on music together. Together 

with indie legend Dave Pajo (of 
Slint and Tortoise fame), Zwan 
made their explosive live debut at 
Anaheim's Glass House in late 
2001. As Zwan ripped through 
their opening number, very little 
of the music could be heard over 
deafening screams and fanatical

'The Family Guy' finally 
finds its way onto DVD 
Long since dismissed by major networks, 

the Griffins get the last laugh 
By RINALDO DORMAN 

Hiatus Editor 

What can one say about "The Family Guy," one of the strangest and most random 
cartoons ever to see its way ontO 
primetime? Most people seem to 
find it either utrerly perplexing or 
absolute genius. UnfoTnmately, far 
too many were not amused by the 
antics of this Quahog, Rhode 
Island, family of six, with three chil-
dren including baby Stewie, a 1-
year-old megalomaniac bent on 
world domination; both parents; 
and the heavy-drinking, dry-witted 
dog Brian. For those who arc not 
fans of the show out of a lack of 
exposure, T would simply suggest 
that if you don't like Cartoon 
Network's programming on Adult 
Swim, "The Simpsons," or 
"Futurama," then you are probably 
going to end up scratching your 
head a lot. And r don't just mean the 
regular 01' lift your hand up and 
scratch with one finger lcind, I mean 
the "take off your hat and lay your 
arm on top of your head 'cause it's 
going to be there for a while" lcind 
of thing. 

The DVD set includes seasons 
one and two - 28 episodes in all-
with seven episodes on each disk.. 
This means, oddly enough, that the 
brief seven episodes of season one 
are on the first disc, and the other 
three discs are for season two.

REVIEW 

Every episode is complete and 
uncut, as intended for airing, so a 
few gags that were CUl out for 
broadcast arc given their full 
impact. 

or everything IS well in the 
twisted world of tillS East Coa t 
\Own. The animation has some odd 
moments, especially on Ie er-qual-
ity DVD players. ome blurring in 
the animation is noticeable dunng 
close-ups with m uths and arms 
creating a wavy line pattern . 
Seriously, th.is is all that is bad about 
the DVD set, and this IS a rather 
small detail in the overall quality of 
production. 

Each disc has two episode with 
audio commentary, containing 
writer/creator/main-voice actor 
Seth MacFarlane along with other 
actors, writers and hangers on. 
While these commentaries often 
produce the occasional bizarre fac-
toid about the production of the 
series (like the fact that for the first 
four episodes, the writing team 
went out of their way to include 
death in each title; that is until they 
could no longer keep plot and titles 
straight), the banter meanders into

AFI to sing the sorrow at Soma 
Punk rock's favorite gothic stepchildren draw cult following 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The openers have all been laid to rest, and the audience is growing tired of the 
"Nightmare Before Christmas" 
tunes that have feebly attempted to 
hold tile audiences attention like a 
featherweight undercard match 
before a Tyson-Holyfield boul. 

Suddenly, it's pitch black, and 
tlle crowded club fills with dry ice 
fog and the blaring of the chorus 
from gothic anthem "0 Fortuna." 
Drummer Adam Carson steps up to 
the kit and counts off the bands 
"Strength Through Wounding" on 
the bass drum while the tllrongs of 
faithful fan5 scream the song's cho-
rus III uni on: 

"Through our bleeding, we are 
one!" 

\Velcome to the show - a tran -
scendent experience for the loyal 
AFI fan and a damn good live show 
to the mo t weathered of rock con-
cert goers. AFI, or A Fire Inside, 
manages to leave no heart unturned 
with their brutally intense shows 
that have made tlleir live act one of 
the most highly demanded in the 
music world. 

More proof' Tickets to AFI's 
upcoming April 23 show at the 
Soma never went on sale to the 
public - they were gone within 
five minutes during the exclusive 
presale offered to members of their 
fan club, The Despair Faction. 

"People have sneaked into our 
shows in drum cases and people 
have climbed on roofs in the rain to 
ju t get into the building," said 
bas ist Hunter. "We've had people 
fly in from other continents to 
come to our shows, a lot of times 
without a ticket. Some people will 
do about anything to get into our 
shows. It's crazy." 

But demand for AFl's live act 
has been no stranger to the band or 
its fans . AFJ has long tried to aVOid 
playing the Goliath venues in favor 
of more intimate settings where the 
band 's raw and emotive energy can 
be exploited properly. After the 
release of their 1999 album Blark 
ails m the Sunset, the Bay Area 

natives found themselves forced to 
play "secret shows" in their home 
region, jumping on the bills of 
bands like T.S.O.L. or The erve 
Agents, unannounced or under an 
alias, to allow true fans to get a leg 
up on the scalpers who have been 
known to hoard $10 tickets and 
filrn around and hock them for 
more than $100 each. 

And the madness has only 
grown more evere ince the recent 
release of their sixth full-length 
album, Smg the SOrTuw. 'The band's 
newest album has een twO II1gle, 
"Gi rl's ot Grey" and "The 
Leaving Song Pt. TI ," reached top-
10 request lists on alternative rock 
radio stations like KROQ, and the 
album itself reached the 0.5 po i-
tion on the Billboard chart. 

While Smg the Somrw is the 
band's sixth full -length release, it is

their first on a major label after 
being on the independent label 

itro Records (owned by 
Offspring frontman and occasional 
AF[ guest vocalist Dexter I [olland) 
since 1996. in December 200 I, the 
band igned with Dreamworks, a 
move that allowed the band to pro-
duce with resources afforded by a 
major label that were unnattainable 
at the indie level. Sing The Sorrow is 
a testament that fixing it while it 
ain't broke isn't always a bad idea . 

"[t's round, and it has a hole in 
the middle," Hunter jokes about 

" People have sneaked inco 
our shows in drum cases 

... just to get into the 
building. l) 

- Hunter, Afl bassist 

(he new CD. His modesty isn't 
fooling any music fan who has lis-
tened to ing the OrTUW. AFI has 
further progressed their style of 
post-hardcore-pop since their 
fourth album, Bladr ails in the 
Surrrrt. It's very apparent that the 
new album is polished on par with 
the liking of a major label, but it 
does not stray from the band's sta-
ples of dark-tinged melodies, half-
Danzig-half-Cure vocal stylings of 

singer Davey Havok and cath~dral­
choir backing vocals among others. 

'!be new album features more 
nontraditional instruments for a 
band that had for years labeled itself 
as "East Bay hardcore" to describe 
their hardcore punk sound reminis-
cent of the Misfits or Minor Threat 
found on their AllfWtr That and Stay 
Fashionllble and ~ry Proud of }O 
albums. 10 "Death of Seasons," the 
band boasts a drum and bass break-
down one might hear at an II1dustri-
al dance club, and the album is laced 
with segments of tring and piano 
sounds. The album is beautifully 
melancholic at times and charged 
with their traditional brutal hard-
core flavor at others. 

The band attributes its move to 
a major label in allowing the 
re ources of extra studio time and 
the help of big name producers like 
Butch Vig and Jerry Finn. 

"It helped us to finally have an 
album that represents where we are 
creatively and artistically," Hunter 
said. "This la t production allowed 
us to create omething as much AF[ 
as we are." 

AFl will be stopping in an 
Diego on April 23 to play at oma. 
Opening act include The 
Explosion, a Boston punk band 
crossbred with the Ramones and 
Misfits influences, and Time in 
Malta, a pop-hardcore band in the 
vein of Thursday and Reach the 

Icy from an Francisco. The how 
is sold our, bur tickets may be 
rele~sed by the venue on the day of 
the event.

'A Mighty Wind' strikes a chord 
Christopher Guest's latest mockumentary doesn't dissapoint 
By DEENA AL SHATTI 

Staff Writer 

With all the lam comedies that are our there today ("Kangaroo Jack," I'm 
looking at you), "A Mighty Wind" 
i definitely a breath of fresh air. 
The film is the latest movIe to 
come from wmer/director 
Christopher Cue t and co-writer 
Eugene Levy, best known for his 
role a Jim' dad in the "American 
Pie" movies. Followmg the rradi-
tion of the pair's previou fi lms 
("Best In how," "Waiting for 
Guffman"), the film is a mocku-
mentary about three fictionalized 
group , The Folksmen, The 
Mainsrreet Singers and Mitch & 
Mickey, who reunite one last time 
for a one-night-only tribute con-
cen. The film follows the concert 
from its beginning stages to the 
show itself. 

The script a a whole is well 
done. While there are a few dry 
pans, the majority of the film is 
funny. The movie does well with a 
few of the stereotypes that they 
carry out, such as entertainment 
executives and public relations 
people. Although some of the 
stereotypes are O\,er the top, they 
still help to shape the movie into 
what it is . The script is pleasurable 
and entertaining. The songs that 
are performed are reminiscent of 
the folk era, and are amu ing and 
fun to listen to. 

But, the key to a good movie is

REVIEW 

cast of "A Mighty Wind" all fit 
perfectly into their roles, and you 
ca n tell that all of the actors are 
having fun. As an overall cast, as 
well as within the groups they 
portray, they have excellent 
chemistry with each other, which 
help them give very talented per-
formances. In parti cular, Eugene 
Levy and Catherine O'Hara shine 
as the duo of Mitch & Mickey, 
bringing humor and fun to their 

roles. 
Overall, "A Mighty Wind" 

proves to be funnier than most 
other comedies that are out today. 
Entertaining and humorous, the 
film is enjoyable and a must-see to 
all who desire a good laugh or just 
want to watch a comedy that's 
actually funny.

Zwan: Band escapes Pumpkins' shadows 
continued from page 1 4 

chanting of" Billy! Billy!" 
Zwan was already impressive at 

its outset, but they still needed a 
final push to further escape the 
shadow of the Pumpkins and 
establish their own identity. Enter 
beautiful Paz Lenchantin, former-
ly of A Perfect Circle, to handle 
bass and backup vocal chJties, 
move Dave Pajo from bass to gui-
tar, and you have Zwan 's current 
lineup. Chamberlain is one of 
rock's most underrated drummers, 
now playing WIth more subtlety 
and clarity than ever. Lenchanon's 
propelling basslines and Sweeney's 
and PaJo's intricate riffery set the 
stage for Corgan's emotional voice 
and guitarwork, creating 

swirling three-guitar attack that is 
unrelentingly Hashy and dynamic. 

Zwan's debut, Mllry Stllr oftbe 
Stll, is one of the most critically 
acclaimed albums of the year. 
Exuberant song titles like" Baby, 
Let's Rock!" and "Yeah!" give 
only a glimpse of the in-your-
face positivity present on the 
album. Corgan sings lines like 
"There's no place I could be 
without you," and "Baby I'm the 
greatest thing you've got" with 
the excitement of a 13 -year-old 
discovering rocle 'n' roll for the 
first time . Brilliant pop songs like 
current singles "Honestly" and 
"Lyric" spill over into acoustic 
gems like "Of a Broken Heart," 
and epics like the 14-minute 

"Jesus, VMary Star of the Sea." 
Zwan performs each one with 
equal dexterity and excitement, 
the rainbows and soaring birds of 
the album's artwork perfectly 
matching the band 's giddy tran-
scendence. 

ZWlIn is an exucmely multifac-
eted band, as evidenced by the 
press' inability to accurately cate-
gorize the band's music, spouting 
off meaningless descriptions like 
"prog-pop - meta I-arena- r olk." 
One reason for this is the expan-
sive catalogue of songs Zwan has 
at its disposal. 

Billy Corgan is easily one of 
the most prolific writers in rocle,

'Forever Plaid' not bad, 
but by no means great 
Welk Resort Theatre production is (ute, 

entertaining, but not that interesting 
By JESSICA LONG 

Senior Staff Writer 

The Welk Resort Theatre's latest production, "Forever Plaid," is a cute production, 
but, while the show can be enter-
taining, it is not really that inter-
esting. The story, so to speak, is 
that of a four-member group that 
gets into a fatal car crash with a 
school bus full of parochial school 
girls and now, 40 years later, they 
have come back to earth to per-
form again. 

There are four actors/singers 
in the show that play the parts of 
the four-man group who met back 
in high school as part of the 
audio-visual club. David 
Humphrey plays Frankie, the 
"ladies man" of the group, who is 
enthusiastic to the point of 
annoying. Ryan Drummond plays 
Smudge, the gee.ky yel optimistic 
member of the group who desper-
ately wants to do well . Steve 
Gunderson plays Sparky, the 
upbeat, outgOing guy who usually 
upstages everyone else. Kevin 
McMahon plays Jinx, the hy, 
clumsy member of the group, who 
suffers so many nosebleeds during 
the course of the show that one 
audience member exclaimed 
rather loudly, "Not again!" 

These four are accompanied 
by Uncle Chester, played by 
Richard Maloof, who does a won-
derful job performing on the bass. 
Justin Gray also has a place on 

rage playing the piano for most 
of the show, as weJl as interacting 

with the character a few times. 
The si nging, which comprises 

most of the 90-minute show, is 
good. However, while the singing 
is wonderful, the songs are rather 
old, and most college-age stu-
dents would only recognize about 
half of them (though it is interest-
ing to note that there are actually 
words to the song "Heart and 
Soul"). 

However, the parts of the show 
that deal with the interaction of 
the characters are weak at best. 
The dialogue drags on and very 
few of the jokes are actually 
funny. They seem to be more of a 
space filler so that the actors can 
catch their breath before moving 
on to the next song. 

The theater itself is a nice 
venue. Set in the Welk Re art in 
San Diego, the Welk Resort 
Theatre is a small, intimate sel-
ting for such a performance. It 
helps the actors play to the audi -
ence, even tallcing to them and 
inviting them up on stage for 
parts of the show. They use the 
space well and use quite a number 
of prop, and small set pieces such 
as movable lights and palm trees 
malce up for the lack of sets. 

Overall, this production IS sat-
isfactory. ot horrible by any 
means, but certainly nothing to 
rush out and see. Perhaps it would 
be a good performance for any 
grandparents who are coming to 
visit. The production runs 
Ihrough June 7. Information and 
reservations are available by call-
ing (888) 802-7469. 

Griffins: 'Family Guy' to be 
added to Adult Swim on 4/20 

continued from page '4 
the mundane or the private jokes 
between show participants. A fre-
quent complaint with any audio 
commentary on DVD is that it 
seems hardly worth sitti ng 
through. Though, it is amusing to 
hear the voice actors take the 
opportunity to let out the swear 
words that gOt bleeped out for 

broadcast. Also included is a fea -
turene that has some of how the 
show is digitally animated and very 
brief interviews with some of the 
voice actors. It is honestly eerie to 
watch MacFarlane go back and 
fourth from Peter and Brian, it just 
doesn't look like those voices 
should come out of his mouth. And 
Seth Green of "Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer"? That little whelp is the 
voice of Chris, the linebacker to 
be? No way. 

in ve n t yourself. 

While the featurene is amusing 
for an immediate laugh and awe 
campaign, the bonuses on the set 
are rather minimal, though it hard-
ly seems to maner. wThe Family 
Guy" spealcs for itself; it's witty, 
frealcishly off-beat and leaves little 
to be pushed outside the barrier of 
decency. Fittingly enough, Cartoon 
Network is adding the show to 
Adult Swim starring April 20.

Corgan: Expect covers, wide 
range of songs in concert 
continued from page 16 

having written over a hundred 
songs for Zwan already. Zwan has 
never played a song from one of tlle 
band members' former bands, but 
they are known to indulge in a 
score of covers ranging from the 
Beatles' "Don't Let Me Down" to 
Alice Cooper's "I'm Eighteen." 

The band ha a number of 
more acoustic-based songs that 
they previewed during shows in 
the Midwest in early 2002. ew 
songs like "Riverview" and 
"Friends and Lovers," both of 
which are in Zwan'~ current reper-
toire of songs that are performed 
but not on the album, how off 
Zwan's softer side. They have 
plans to record an acoustic album 
and DVD later this year under the 

alias The Djali Zwan. Corgan says 
that the band will be its own enti -
ty sepa rate frolll Zwan and will 
give him an outlet for hi ~ acoustic 
material without worrying "how 
it's going to stand up against some 
rock epic." 

In the meantime, electric Zwun 
has been touring all over the U. . 
and Europe to favorable live 
reviews. T his is not only due to 
the great songs they have written 
but also the zea l with which these 
five rock 'n' roll survivors tear 
through them. You 'll never sec 
another band so happy to be alive 
and making music together, unit-
ed by a shared musical vision: 
bringing peace and love to the 
people and rocking the shit out of 
you .

lead UCSD 
continued from page :14 

meeting on March 28, Ihe Tritons 
shut down the Lacers' momentum 
early on, scoring nine stra ight after 
twO goals frOIll their opponent, en 
route to a 13-2 blowout. Once 
again, Tucker and ' ilverman took 
charge of the Tmon scoring, with 
four and three goals, respectively. 

UC D's two victories set up a 
pivotal game with cro~s-town foe 
SD U; the winner of the malch 
would take Group 3 and compete 
for first place the next day. UC D 
played tough against the Aztecs, 
finding itself down only 3-2 after 
the first period, and remaining 
down by only one goal for most of 
the match, With Keesey's three 
goals keeping them in contention. 
Ilowever, the Tntons couldn't find 
the tying goal, despite numerous 
offensive opportunities, and the 
Aztec took charge the rest of the 
way, grabbing a 9-6 victory. 

The loss put the Tmons 
smack-dab in the middle of the 
competition for fourth place, 
along with Arizona State and U 
Irvine. The un Devils gave the 
Trnom quite the challenge In the 
first game, taking Ihe match into 
overtime. The decision didn't 
come until ilverman ru hed to 
the rescuc with thc game-winning 
goal that capped off a brilliant 
U D comeback and earned 
them a 9- win. 

The Tritons rushed right back in 
the pool only an hour and a haJflater 
to face off against the Ante3ters. 
fatigue conrributed to a 3- 1 Irvine 
lead at the half, but U D came up 
WIth another trademark comeback, 
putnng up SIX goals In the econd 
hal to take 7-5 dcclsion and secure 
fourth place. 

"Fourth place was a good finish 
for us, but we're aIming for bigger 
things; we need to come out strong 
every quarter, not just three peri-
ods" Sanders aid. 

The Triton get another shot at 
the Aztecs on April 19 at SDSU, 
but expect the emotions to run 
high on April I ,when the Triton

SENIOR SENDOFF Invitational: 
Co,captain Bromley leaves women's basketball team 
Guard's 1,087 points has her third on UCSD's scoring list 

Tritons look 
forward to 

tournament By OWEN MAIN 
Associate Sports Editol 

It's not every day that a school 
fits a srudent as well as UCSD fit 
senior women's basketball player 
Nicholle Bromley. 

"I came here because of acade-
mics and because I'd get to playa 
lot right away," Bromley said. 

And play right away she did. In 
her freshman year, the Rancho 
Bernardo High School sta r won 
the honors of team Rookie of the 
Year, while averaging 8.4 points 
per game and 5.3 rebounds. 

But athletics aren't the only 
thing on Bromley'S mind. A biolo-
gy major, Bromley will graduate in 
June. 

"I wanted to be pre-med and 
play basketball , and UCS D was a 
natural fit," Brom ley said . 

During her tllne at UCSD, she 
not only won Roolue of the Year 
during her freshman sea on, but 
earned the team's Out tanding 
Srudent Award during her sopho-
more campaign, along with the 
Heart and Hustle award her junior 
year. 

As the lone senior and co-cap-
tain on an otherwise young team 
this season, Bromley helped the 
team right the ship after a dismal 
0-9 start to tile season, and finish 
with a 10-17 overall record ( 10-12 
in the Calirornia Collegiate 

BasebaD 

Athletic Association). 
"[Next year's team] could be 

very successful," Bromley said. 
"They're starting to become more 
experienced. Ali [Ginn}, Thea 
[Bachmann) and Robyn [Phillips] 
will all be seniors." 

The UCSD guard said her 
most memorable moment playing 
basketball for the Tritons was dur-
ing the 2001-02 season when, in 
their first game, the Tritons took 
Out cross-town Division J SDSU. 

"It was one of the be t games 
I've ever played in," Bromley said. 
"Everybody was on all game. I felt 
like I was about 6'2": 

Arter overcoming the chal -
lenge of a tough start on the court 
this season, Bromley's next chal-
lenge is the MCATs, which she'll 
take in two weeks. 

" I've been studYi ng fo r the 
M AT! ror the first part of this 
quarter," Bromley said. " I'm only 
taking one class so J can have time 
to study for the test." 

Despite only taking one class 
this quarter, Bromley will graduate 
on time after four years at UC D. 

"I don't know how [did it," said 
Bromley about graduating in four 
years. "I've taken some summer 
school clas es. Maybe [ was so con-
cerned about [graduating in four 
years] that I just took enough." 

Along with taking enough 
classes, the three-year starter man-

aged to score 10. 1 points per game 
and became only the fifth player in 
school history to score more then 
1,000 points in her career. Her 
1,087 total points ral1.1cs her third 
in UCSD history. She also finished 
her career ranked fifth in steals, 

sixth in assists, sixth in free-throw 
percentage and 15th in rebounds 
on the Triton all-time list. 

"I'm taking a year off after this 
year," she said. "I'll most likely 
stay in San Diego and work on 
applying to medical schooL", 

Game tllT1es are as foUows: 

ccmcinued from page :22 
shooting rounds of 81, 79 and 86 
for a total of 246, 30 over par, 
tying for 65th overall. 

UCSD's next tournament will be 
the CCM Championship held at 
the Diablo Grande Golr Course in 
Patterson, Calif., on April 22 and 
April 23. 

"We're going to hold a qualify-
ing match to see which golfers will 
go to the championship, and if we 
do well as a team there, there is a 
good chance we will advance to the 
regionals," Wydra said. 

Knows: 
Hockey is an 
overlooked 

sport 
contmued from page 24 

on Tv: But hockey is more fun to 
watch in person than it tS on TV My 
point is that if you're looking for a 
great sporting event to attend, per-
haps for the first time, go to a south-
ern California hockey game, and 
give yoursel f a chance to experience 
it. For my money, it is definitely the 
mo t overlooked value in sports. Upcoming

five," Wydra said.

Baseball: Tritons give up lead in ninth 
continued /Tom page 24 

Hernandez committed another 
error in the inn ing, putting 
Triton des ignated hitter Matt 
Smith aboard. UC D thi rd 
baseman Matt Merrifield sin-
gled to left field, plating Fante. 
Miller and Smith scored after 
righ t fielder Brett Burton 
reached on a fielder's choice. 
Center fielder David Hawk 
singled down the left-field 
line, driving in Merrifield and 
Burton. 

Ahead 6-3 heading into the 
bottom of the ninth, the 
Tritons were unable to hold 
onto their lead and secure the 
game. Chico went on to score 
three runs in the bottom half 
of the inning, after Wildcat 
right fielder Steve ewson hit 
a three-run home run off of 
UCSD pitcher Alex Cremidan, 
pushing the game into extra 
innings. In the bottom of the 
II th, UCSD fre hman pitcher 

Justin uarez gave up a solo 
home run to vVildcat pinch 
hitter John Moylan, as Chico 
edged out the Tritons 7-6 in 
game one. 

"We were not playing our 
best baseball, and we blew a 
three -run lead in the ninth 
inning, but we still put our-
selves in a position to win," 
said UCSD head coach Dan 
O'Brien. "We just need to get 
better at closing Out and win-
ning ball games." 

Suarez picked up the loss 
for the Tritons and falls to 0-2 
on the season. 

tiller went 2-for-3, short-
Stop Keith Ilernandez went 2-
for-5 with twO doubles and 
Hawk went 2-for-4 in the 
game. 

Junior hurler Raf 
Bergstrom took the hill for 

UCS D in the seven-inning 
second game of the double-
header. Bergstrom, now 5 - I, 
pitched h is th ird complete 
game of the season for the 
Tritons, but picked up his first 
loss of the season when Chico 
State beat UCSD 4-0. 

The Wi ldcats put up two 
runs in the bottom of the first 
inning off of Newson's ninth 
home run of the year, putting 
pressure on the Tritons to 
respond. In the fourth inning, 
left fie lder Jonathan Shepard 
tripled and proceeded to score 
in the inning. The Wildcats 
added another run in the fifth 
to secu re thei r victory. 

With the two losses, UCSD 
falls into a tie for first place in 
the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association with 
Chico State and onoma State. 

low 24-18 overall and 18- 12 
in the C AA, and with pre -
sure mounting from other 
conference teams, the Tritons 
need to be successful in the 
remaining twO CCAA series. 

"We really need to solidify 
our bullpen and the guys need 
to step up if our ball club wants 
to remain in playoff con-
tention," O'Bnen said. "\Ve 
need to deal with our iniurie . 
At this point in the season, the 
depth of a team becomes a fac-
tor in the conference." 

UCSD squares off against 
conference rival UC Davis this 
weekend in a crucial four-
game series beginning on April 
I at 2:30 p.m. at Triton 
Baseball Field . 

"It will be a challenging 
weekend for us," O'Brien said. 
"Davis is a good ball club, but 
whoever wants it more and 
whoever plays the best baseball 
will win .n

CLUB SPORTS 
MEN'S LACROSSE 

In a showdown for the third 
seed in the Western Collegiate 
Lacrosse League playoffs, the 
Tritons prevai led over the 8th-
ranked Arizona Wildcats 10-6, on 
April 11. UCSD fre hman ick 
Dean led the Tritons with six 
points, in addition to two goals 
and four assi ts, to give the 
Tritons a crucial victory over the 
Wildcats. 

The two tcams came alit onto 
the field fired up; C '0 had the 
upper hand, though, slIlce the 
Tl'ltons were playing in front of a 
rowdy home crowd that exceeded 
over 300 fans at RIMAC field. 

[n the beginl1lng of the game, 
the crowd had little effect on the 
\Vildcats, however, who com-
pletely dominated ball pos~es Ion 
for the first five minutes of the 
contest. Arizona took an early 2-0 
lead with 12 :14 ren1:lining i~ the 
qU:lrter. 

But Arizona' good fortune ran 
Out quickly; the Wildcats were 
nagged for a total of seven penal-
ties in the first half, and never 
regained the momentum that 
helped them dominate in the early 
gomgs. Dean and the rest of the 
Tritons took advantage of 
Arizona's misfortunes, and UCSD 
rallied back with three goals in the 
first quarter and four goals in the 
econd quarter to take a 7 -~ lead 

going into halftime. 
The final two quarters turned 

into a defensive batrle; The 
Wildcat defense did all it could to 
keep the Tmon attack in check, 
and UCSD's new netminder Jody 
Ilochstein made six point-blank 
saves in the third quarter. 

Even with their offense having 
trouble possessing the ball, 
Arizona's defense was able to hold 
the Tritons from gaining no more 
than a four-goal lead, and went 
into the final quarter trailing 
U D 8-5 . Stepping up their 

game, UCSO 
defenseman 
C h r i 
Washington and 
the Tritons defense 
held Arizona's 
offense to just one 
goal in the final 
quarter. 

With 4:05 
remallllllg in the 
game, UCSD's lead 
anackman Ross Sten rud 
scored on a buJI dodge 
from the bottom left cor-
ner to secure the victory 
for the Tri tons. 

"\Ve received a strong all-
around effort from everyone on 
the team," ten rud said. "J 
believe this is the first game in this 
season that we were able to put 
together four quarters of quality 
lacrosse. I think this game showed 
that we could compete with any-
one in the [United States Lacrosse 
Intercollegiate Associatlonj ." 

n April 12, the Tritons played 
agalllst Anzona tate III a game 
ruled by U SD from the start. 
The day was highlighted by 

tensrud's six-goal performance in 
his last home game for UCSD. 
His offen ive effort helped lift the 
Tritons to an easy 16-5 win. 

frer clinching the third seed 
in the WCLL South Division 
playoffs, UCSD will face 
Chapman in the WCLL quarterfi-
nals this upcoming weekend.

tate Im1tallonal. On the way to a 
fourth -place finl\h at the tourna-
ment, the Tritons picked up victo-
ries over U Bakersfield, Cal 

Bapti~t, UC Irville and Arizona 
State, but failed to hake off early 
defenSive lapses In dose losses to 
LM and SDSU. 

"""e came out ~trong early In 
both losses," said UCSD head 
coach Larry SJnders. "But a ter we 
would grab our first goal, It 
seemed like we would let up a bit, 
and thal'~ when (LMU and SDSU] 
would get ahead of liS." 

CSD opened Up ItS busy 
weekend With a big game again I 
Loyola Maryrnount on April II; a 
VICtory over the conference-lead-
Ing LIOns would give the Triton 
great momentum heading IntO 
the WWPA Championships. 
UCSD looked harp early on as 
Elizabeth Keesey gave the 
Tritons a 1-0 lead just 33 second 
Into the game. After an LMU 
equalizer, Triton co-captain Dana 
Tucker converted a four-meter 
penalty shot to regain the lead. 
Unfortunately, that was the last 
time UCSD would hold the 
advantage, as LMU hit the next 

three goals to take a 4-2 lead. The 
Lions and Triton lraded goal a 
couple more tIIl1es in the half, 
making the score al intermission 
7 -4 in favor of LM U. Tucker 
cored the only point in a defen-

sive second half, and U SO 
could not get any closer In the 7-
5 loss. 

The sting of defeat eemed to 
follow UCSD into it fir t game 
of the LB U Invitational on 

pnl 12, where Bakersfield 
Jumped out to a surpn IIlg 3- 1 
advantage with 3:30 left In the 
first, only to find the Tritons giv-
Ing a five-goal reply to take a 6-3 
lead . The Roadrunner would 
score two more in the econd to 
make it 6-5 before the Tritons 
went on another goal-scoring 
creak, putting up four tralght 

for a 10-5 lead, on the w y to a 
13-7 win . Tucker and amara

Grit and 
grace make 

hockey a 
great game 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

S ometimcs I wish I could have grown up some place colder than the central coast of 
California; ~orne place where they 
play hockey. 

I've played my fair share of 
sports, but never ho key. I do know, 
however, thai I 100'e the idea of 
being able to get back Jt somebody 
or get rough with someone In a 
port withoul being penali7ed 

severely for It. 
And I'm 110t talking about a 

Marty Mc orley-Iike II1cident here. 
I'm talking about the kll1d of phYSI-
cal and verbal "extracurricular" 
activity that mighl get you an ejec-
tion in a basketball or football game. 
Hockey players do the kind of sruff 
during games that I always wanted 
to do playing other sports. 0 I 
thought I might have been good at 
hockey, except for one problem: I 
can't skate. 

Before I ever went to a hockey 
game, I watched it on TV and 
enjoyed it for the mo;t part, espe-
cially during playoff time. 

An argument could be made that 
some games like football and bas-
ketball are better on lelevision; but 
then I saw a game live. ' (\\'o years 
ago I went to see a minor league 
hockey game - theres no compari-
son - really. I was a changed sports 
fan. 

I couldn't believe how cool it was 
(no pun intended, although the 
Zambonie is the coolest machine in 
sports): how everything seemed to 
happen at a different speed and on a 
different level than most other
