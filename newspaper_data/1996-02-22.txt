Former UA Student 
Aw.ded $5 Million 
PHOENIX - A I O-person jury 
last week found the University 
of Arizona Recreation Center 
negligent in caring for Stacey 
Spiegler, a 20-year-old UA 
senior who suffered a heart 
auack in 1990 while riding a 
stationary bicycle at the cent~r. 
Jurors awarded Spiegler, who 
suffered brain damage due to a 
lack of oxygen, $5 miilion in 
damages. In addition, the jury 
concluded that the VA Rec 
Center employees' failure to 
administer CPR contributed to 
Spiegler's condition. "I think 
[the jury] felt SOIl)' for Stacey," 
UA Rec Center Director Grant 
Smith said, following the 
verdict.

LEXINGTON, Ky. - A new 
study shows that college 
students who smoke marijuana 
"heavily" may have trouble 
paying attention or performing 
tasks which require concentra-
tion, even after going a day 
without using the psychoactive 
drug. People who smoked 
marijuana more than four days 
per week performed signifi-
cantly worse on tasks which 
involved maintaining and 
shifting concentration. The 
study's authors said that 
marijuana's after-effects on 
thinking might result from drug 
residue in the brain, withdrawal 
or nervous-system damage.

A WHALE OF A JOB UCSB Student 
Newspaper 
Files Suit vs. 
Gov. Wilson 
ACCUSED: Reporter claims 
Wilson violated state Bagley-
Keene Open Meeting Act 
By Marianne Vigil 
Senior Staff Writer 

In yet another development in the University 
of California's decision to repeal affirmative 
action, UC Santa Barbara's newspaper, The 
Daily Nexus, has filed a lawsuit against Gov. 
Pete Wilson, alleging violations of state open-
meeting laws. ! 

If successful, Nexus Campus Editor Tim 
Molloy's suit could nullify the VC Board of 
Regents' July 1995 decision to end affirmative-
action practices in university-wide admissions, 
hiring and contracting. 

Molloy alleges in the suit that Wilson, a 
regent by virtue of hi s office, engaged in 
"back-room" dealings with several other re-
gents before the July 20 public meeting, so as 
to ensure that the vote on Regent Ward 
Connerly' SP- I and SP-2 proposals would 
be favorable . 

Molloy claims that Wilson violated the 
Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act by calling 
several of the regents before the meeting. In 
addition, the suit alleges that Wilson violated 
the California Public Records Act by refusi ng to 
release records pertaining to hi s telephone con-
ver ations with the olher regents . 

Wilson could not be reached for comment. 
According to Molloy, a comment by Regent 

Roy Brophy saying that Wilson had "made a 
pitch for the measure" first made him and others 
al the student newspaper suspect some of the 
deliberations had been carried out secretly . 

In addition, Molloy said that he requested 
in writing Wilson's phone records under the 
California Public Record Act 25 times. 
Wilson's office refused to release the infor-
mation on the grounds that it was privileged, 
and that it infringed upon the right to privacy 
of those Wilson called.

Administrators Say UCSD Received $1.1 Billion in Fiscal 1995 
EXPENSES: 
Instruction was 18.9 
percent of the budget 
By Kathleen Gallagher 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD received $1.1 billion in 
revenue during the 1995 fiscal year 
and returned a majority of it to the 
local economy through leaching and 
research aClivities, as well as VCSD 
Medical Center operations, accord-
ing to a recently released ~onomic-

impact report by the universi ty . 
A large portion ofUCSD's rev-

enue came from outside the San 
Diego area, the report stated. Fi -
nancial sources included various 
federal agencies, which contrib-
uted 24.3 percent of total funding ; 
the slate government with 17.9 
percent; and UCSD Medical Cen-
ter patient fees with 27.3 percent. 

The remainder came from stu-
dent tuition and fees, private gifts, 
educational activities and auxiliary 
enterprises such a the UCSD Book-

store. 
Recent surveys by the National 

Science Foundation ranked UCSD 
sixth in the nation and first in the UC 
system in terms of federal-agency 
research awards . VCSD was 
awarded $325 million in research 
grants and contracts in fiscal 1995. 
The university also spent $23S.5 
million on independently sponsored 
research, the report stated. 

Research-related activities ac-
counted for 25.2 percent of the 
university's $1.02 billion budget, 

while the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest received 27.1 percent of 
the budget. 

Instructional costs accounted for 
another tS .9 percent of the budget, 
while various acadcmic-supportscr-
vices - including the UCSD Li-
braries and Academic Computing 
Services - received 9.S percent.

ous goods and services per month,

Scripps Marine Chemist Honored 
Dr. Edward Goktlerg, a Scripps Institution of Oceanog-

raphy chemistry professor, has been .awarded the 1996 
.John H. MartIn Medal of Excellence in the Marine Sciences 
by the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, 

Goldberg. a renowned marine chemist who is consid-
ered to be the leading authority on ocean pollution, was 
honored for "his distinguished scientific leadership, his 
outstanding contributions to the field of marine chemistry 
and his lifelong efforts to protect the ocean environment." 

Goldbergjoined SIO in 1949 and has been a profes-
sor of chemistry there since 1961, His present research 
involves the role of the platinu~roup metals in the 
environment and sutHnicron particles In oceanic chem-
istries. 

Goldberg is responsible for identifying tributyl tins 
(TBTs) as among the most toxic pollutants ever intro-
duced into the coastal marine environment. His investi-
gations showed that TBTs used in boat-hull paints to 
retard barnacle growth also harmed oysters and other 
marine fife. TBTs are now banned from use on small 
vessels which traverse coastal waters. 

According to the chairman of the awards committee, 
the John H. Martin Medal is "given to scientists and/or 
dynamic leaders who have had a significant impact on 
the ocean sciences.· 

Minority Bone Marrow Donors 
Sought by San Diego Blood a_ 

Far thousands of men, women and children with fatal 
blood disorders, a bone-marrow transplant is their only 
hope for survival. According to the San Diego Blood 

Bank, there is an increasingly urgent need for marrow 
donors of African-American, Asian, Pacific Islander, 
Hispanic and Native-American descent. 

Free bone-marrow testi~ will be available on Feb. 28 
and 29 at the Price Center. Bone-marrow testing simply 
Involves donating one tablespoon of blood, which is used 
to determine bone-marrow type. If a match is later found, 
the donor is contacted for a possible marrow donation. 

Marrow produces white blood cells, the main agents of 
the body's immune system, as well as other blood cells. 

Marrow type is an inherited trait, which is why the 
chances Of finding a match are best among family 
members. But when no relative can be found with a 
compatible marrow type, a non-relative donor must be 
sought. Because of genetic influences on marrow type, 
the chances of finding a match are better among people 
of the same race. 

New Module Allows Students to 
Print Articles on Reserve at UGL 

The Undergraduate Library (UGL) recently completed 
testing on a new electronic-reserves module which allows 
students to print out articles placed on reserve for five 
cents per copy, as opposed to the 15 cents per copy 
charged by library copy machines. Using the UCSD Book-
store to obtain copyright permissions, the electronic-
reserves module gives students maximum access to 
materials while maintaining control over copyrighted ar-
ticles. By developing a password system, UGl hopes to 
eventually scan copyrighted material directly onto its World 
Wide Web page.

A.S. Officers Vent Frustration Over Lack of Participation 
ABSENTEEISM: Falk 
decries council's 
general apathy 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

Several members of the A.S. 
Council stormed out of an emotion-
ally charged meeting last night. af-
ter expressing frustration with "the 
level of infighting" and "lack of 
work being accomplished by [the] 
council." 

Following weeks of debate sur-
rounding the funding of A.S.-spon-
sored activities and student organi-
zations, various officers accused the 
entire council of being "divided" 
and "unsupportive." 

Assessing his office's activities 
this year. A.S . Vice President of 
External Affairs Brian Dowd said: 
"[External Affairs does] positive 
things for this campus ... there are 
people in our office who work hard 
and give 40 to 50 hours a week 
because they really care about the 
issues that we work with." 

"All we want is some goddamn 
respect from the rest of [the] council 
and no more of this infighting," 
Dowd added. 

Last week, ciling a lack of funds 

in its General Unallocated budget 
(GU), the A.S. Council voted down 
Dowd'srequest for$I,450-mostly 
coming from GU - to send UCSD 
students to the California Higher 
Education Student Summit 
(C. H.E.S.S.) from Feb. 23 to Feb. 
25. 

At last night' s meeting, however. 
the council approved a new $1,263 
budget for C.H.E.S.S., with a lim-
ited amount of funding taken from 
GU, as well as the A.S. Public Rel a-
tion budget and the Student Lobby 
budget. 

"[External Affairs 
doe.] po.ltlve 
things for thll 
campu .... there are 
people In our office 
who work hard and 
give 40 to SO hours 
• week because 
the, r .. 11y c.e 
• boutth.I ...... 
that we work with. " 

-Brtan Dowel 
A.S. Vice President External 

"If we don't send students to 
[C.H.E.S.S.], then wearecomplctely 
losing out," A.S. President Naomi 
Falk said. 

"At this point, I've become rc-
ally disheartened with the infight-
ing in [the] council... I think it's 
prellyobvious that counci l members 
are voting on items based on who's 
authoring them, not their content ," 
Falk added. "I've been in [the] AS . 
for four years. and on council for 
three ... I have never hated it nearly 
thi s much before. and I feel as if I'm 
waiting out ajail sentence." 

Anolher issue which drew con-
cern from various AS. officers dur-
ing last night 's meeting included 
the high rate of member absentee-
ism at council and committec mect-
ings this year. 

According to AS. Vice Presi-
dent Administrati ve Jennifer Nicoll, 
charges were filedagainstsevcn A.S. 
councilmembers in light oftheir fre-
quent absences. The charges will be 
heard by the Judicial Board . 

" I hope that councilmembers 
understand the gravity of this is-
sue," Nicoll said . 

Falk also pointed out her con-
cern overthe high number of absen-
tee councilmembers. 

"I cannot believe that there have

" I cannot believe that there arc

"Hopefully, we can get more accom-
plished forthe rest of this term." 

Later in the meeting, Nicoll indi-
cated that problems within counci l 
should be resolved intcmally. 

"Councilmembers shouldn ' t be 
addressing all of these issues in [the 
council meeting)," Nicoll said. "Per-
haps I failed a little bit in having 
these problems ~esolved thi s year." 

"We have a lot of problems, but 
there are other ways to resolve 
them," she added. 

In other council news, 
council members reported on activ-
ity within their respective offices. 

A.S. Vice President of Finance 
EdmondoRobinson announced vari-
ous finance projects aimed at ampli -
fyi ng student ervices, including a 
possible extension of the San Diego 
Transit (SDT) bus lines. which honor 
UCSD student bus passes. 

Robinson said the area covered 
by SDT - which currentl y includes 
most of La 10lla - may come to 
include Paci fic Beach. 

"There are lots of students who 
use the bus services now, but there 
are even more who live out in local 
areas like Pacific Beach who could 
benefit from this service," Robinson 
said. 

"As of now, this is just an idea 
that we' re working with , and be-
cause it requires a great deal offund-
ing, I can't say for sure whether it 
will work out," he added. 

In other business, Robinson said 
the A.S. Finance office is working 
toward corporate sponsorship of 
UCSD student organizations. 

"If we can get corporate groups 
to sponsor student organizations. 
that would require less from for our 
student organizat ion budge t," 
Robinson said.

UCSB Papw Creates Its Own 
News, Loa •• All Credibility 

Earlier this year, editors of an East Coast college newspaper 
pulled a fire alarm because they were shon on news and 
wanted a feature photo of a fire truck in pursuit. The editors 
were ultimately punished for their actions, and a majority of 
the editorial staff resigned. 

The UC Santa Barbara Daily Nexus ' recent lawsuit against 
Gov. Pete Wilson - for violating open-meeting laws - is 
strikingly similar to that fire-truck fiasco, but the NexuJ staff 
will not be punished. 

However, they should resign after their shameful display of 
journalistic narcissism. Under the guise of "defenders of the 
public trust," the NexuJ generated its own news, and - in self-
congratulating fashion - splashed it across the front page of 
their paper. The Nexus staff crossed the line into pure subjec-
tivity, ceasing to be an unbiased observer, and instead decided 
to become an active agent of the political arena. 

Regardless of whether Wilson was at fault, the Nexus 
violated, rather than defended the public trust. And, in doing 
so, it made a grave mistake. 

A newspaper must strive, at all times, to be an objective 
observer. Objectivity isn't always possible, but a good paper 
nonetheless makes it its primary goal. Striving toward objec-
tivity lets the reader know that, despite the personal feelings of 
rach editor, the paper will try to present both sides of an issue. 

For this reason, credible newspapers act as observers, 
refusing to involve themselves in politics, business or other 
innuences. To be objective about anything, a paper must view 
a process from the outside. If a newspaper is a player in a 
politically charged event, then that newspaper's bias is imme-
diately called to question . 

The editors of the Nexus, instead of assening their opinions 
through editorials and commentaries - and revealing the 
wrongdoings which they fell they had discovered - became a 
part of the political process toward which it had previously been 
objective. And the editors' actions destroyed any credibility the 
newspaper may have possessed concerning such issues. 

In fact, the Nexus' lack of objectivity not only handicaps its 
ability to repon on the governor, it calls into question aLL 
storifs it has and will publish. Readers will no longer be able 
to di$Cern whether the Nexus has attempted to remain sepa-
rated from the issues it repons, or whether its bias has affected 
the paper's presentation of the story. 

A newspaper's primary responsibility to its readership-
presenting factual information and reasoned argument -
depc:nds utterly on its objectivity and separation. The Nexus 
staff. much like the staff of the paper involved in the fire-truck 
incident, made their own news. But perhaps even worse, they 
patted themselves on the back for it. 

UCSD Needs a ClBlC8lIor 
Who Will Take a Stand 

After a 27 -year chancellorship at UCLA, Charles Young has 
decided to retire. Known for his interaction with students and 
taking strong stances on issues pertaining to his beloved univer-
sity, Young is a good role model for UCSD' s future chancellor, as 
well as for current Interim Chancellor Marjorie Caserio. 

Caserio has yet to take a firm stance on any issue, despite 
her prominent position on campus. The Voz Fronteriza 
incident, the proposed UCSD chaner school and other issues 
have been unaddressed by her office. The fact that her tenure 
as chancellor is only one year long should not be a deterrent in 
her decision-making. On the contrary, she should take 
Young's example and stand up for her principles. 

Furthermore, in UCSO's quest for a new chancellor, the 
candidates which the search committee considers should 
possess some of Young's qualities - courage. perseverance, a 
willingness to interact with students and a desire to respond to 
their needs. 

Sadly, few such people exist. If, however, UCSD finds one 
of these rare individuals to fill in as chancellor next year, our 
campus and its students would benefit greatly from such a

THE MYTH OF THE MODERN 
STEREOTYPE 

COMMENTARY: Political correctness strikes again, turning all 
stereotypes and generalizations into negative and offensive statements 

D ere k 
van 

HOFTEN 
The Voice of 

Reason 

In its misguided quest for 
social peace, the paranoid left 
wing has spawned a number 
of dangerous movements: po-
litically correct speech, cen-
orship and revisionist his-

tory, to name a few of the 
most widespread. 

While most rational people 
scoff and point fingers at 
these ideas, we are still peri-
odically trapped in their ex-
pansive web. 
Far too many 
of us have to 
hesitate be-

not negative by nature. Being short, thin or hairy is 
not a feature that should offend someone. Biologi-
cal traits and cultural roles are facts, and should not 
be taboo subjects. 

Some people suggest stereotypes are bad because 
they often include untrue or derogatory characteris-
tics : Blacks are licentious criminals, or Jews are 
money-grubbers . Indeed. not all stereotypes are ac-
curate, and a lot of them might offend people. 

But it is important to distinguish between nega-
tive and harmless stereotypes . The left wing has 
made society so paranoid about offending different 

groups that now all blanket state-
ments make people quiver and look 
around to see if anyone was insulted. 
This paranoia has turned such in-
nocuous statements as "Japanese 
work hard" and "Generation Xers are 
cynical" into outright confrontations. 
Ideally, we should be mature and ra-
tional enough to recognize the dif-
ference between these alternate types 
of stereotyping. 

fore ullering a 
formerly common word that has 
somehow acquired an inappropriate 
value: "black" is now an insult, "Ori-
ental" is demeaning and "short" is 
terribly rude. It's all part of the 
oversensitivity trend; everyone feels 
as if he ought to be offended, so he 
picks and chooses words and calls 
them offensive, racist, sexist, agist, 
hair colorist and so on. 

The worst by-product of this lu-
nacy has been the artificially nega-
tive label applied to stereotypes. 
Currently, any statement applied to 
more than four people is considered 
a stereotype, and thus horribly offen-
sive, regardless of how true or harm-
less it may be. But we have to re-
member that stereotypes are not all 
pejorative; most are simply a means 
of generalizing, which in itself is not 
innately evil. Nobody makes blan-
ket statements and intends to apply 
them to everyone in a particular cat-

People also shun stereotypes for 
fear that they will lead to further gen-
eralizations, which they naturlWly 
assume will include derogatory over-
tones: If I notice that blacks are su-
perior basketball players, soon 
enough I will stan to wonder about 
their sexual appetites. And if I be-
lieve that blacks are superior basket-
ball players, it automatically means 
I think they are less intellectual. But 
what is the connection between ath-
letic ability and intelligence? It is this 
kind of false association that has 
made all stereotypes negative. 

races are

In ."ery 
capacity. 

More importantly, we should ac-
knowledge that even negative stereo-
types can be true. Naturally, this line 

of thinking makes some people shudder, but accept-
ing reality is better than living in a perpetual state 
of delusion . Rather than acknowledging simple and 
natural inequality from one person to the next, the 
politically correct would prefer that we aim for a 
utopia, where everyone is considered as useful as 
the next. Unfortunately - or fortunately, depend-
ing on one's point of view - that is not the case, 

egory - there will always be exceptions in any 
group. And that is understood: Stereotypes simply 
apply to most people in a particular group. 

Beyond that, stereotypes originated because they 
are basically accurate. Like clichc5s, they may be 
overused and trite, but they also tend to be true. Most 
Asians are short, most blacks have large lips, most 
whites can't jump and most men hog the remote con-
trol. Again, we must remember that stereotypes are See UTOPIA, Page 6

COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH 

THE BLACK CHILD Is STILL LOST IN THE GHETTO 
By K8thIHn Lytle 
Staff Writer 

In the United States, the biller 
realities of capitalism are mani-
fested in the lives of black chil-
dren. Black children must endure 
rejection, denial , confinement and 
attacks. Horrifying statistics reo 
veal that each day, 1,118 black 
youths become victims of violent 
crime, 33 black babies die before 
their first birthdays and 1,019 
black babies are born into poverty. 
Where is progress for the black 
child? 

By contrasting the social con-
ditions of black and white chil-
dren , we see the two are separated 
by a wide chasm. According to a 
January 1996 Children's Defense 
Fund article, over 46 percent of 
black children live in poverty, 
compared to 13.6 percent of white 
children. Black children are four 
times more likely to die of an HIV 
infection and two-and-a-half times 
more likely to die during their first 
year as a result 0 flow bi rth 
weight. This comparison illus-
trates the need to address the im-
poverished conditions surround-
ing black children. 

Currently, the nation tends to 
blame or credit individuals for 
their social position: The wealthy 
deserve their wealth; the poor de-
serve their poverty. But what 
about the children who cannot 
control the misfortunes of birth? 
Why do we demand they live in 

the crippling conditions they do 
not deserve? Racist ideologies jus-
tify the povcrty of black children. 
In America, black and poor are in-
decipherable as soci al realities. To 
change the living conditions of 
black children - and subse-
quently all children - we need to 
comprehend the factors which al-
low black poverty to persist. 

Afraid to enter the ghettos, so-
ciety depends upon the media to 
learn about poor black youths. ' 
Consequently, few people actually 
know anything about the hard-
ships these youths face every day. 

For instance, South Central Los 
Angeles is one of the nation's most 
infamous ghettos, plagued by pov-
erty and urban decay. Liquor 
stores are on nearly every corner. 
Public schools are in dire need of 
repairs. Worst of all, children play 
in parks littered with dirty needles 
and crack vials . Confronted with 
these conditions, some will tri-
umph, and some wi II not. 

Consider the following sce-
nario: In the summer of 1994, 107 
children in Los Angeles partici-
pated in Freedom Schools. Held 
each summer, the schools are a 
nationwide initiative of the 
Children's Defense Fund and the 
Black Community Crusade for 
Children , which provides free aca-
demic and cultural enrichment for 
children. Every day, the children 
walked with Freedom School staff 
members to a designated park to 

Yet despite the 
dismal 
conditions, we 
somehow expect 
inner-city youths 
to overcome 
poverty through 
"hard work. " 
But shouldn't it

responsibility to 
end their 
poverty through 
our own ·"hard 
work?" 
participate in the Summer Food 
Service Program (SFSP), a free 
lunch program serving children 

living in (lOor areas. 
On their way to the park, the 

chi Idren first had to pass by a 
crack house -- a boarded up, 
tagged, debilitated but neverthe-
less occupied building. The other 
side of the street featured a "Crip" 
house . Such scenes are faced by 
children on a daily basis, further 
reinforcing the only option these 
kids can see for survival in the 
ghettos: a gang. 

Next, the Freedom School kids 
passed a Jack-in-the-Box, where 
a bullet-proof wall had been 
erected above the counter between 
the customers and the employees. 
A person must place his money in 
a rotating, bullet-proof cash col-
lector to pay for his food. 

When the children finally 
reached the park to sit down for 
their SFSP lunch, they were given 
spoiled fruit and bologna sand-
wiches. This was no surprise to 
them. Some complained, but most 
accepted this rejection because 
they realize their class and color 
make them second-class citizens. 
White children can ignore race is-
sues, but black children under-
stand that their poverty is a direct 
result of society'S abhorrence to 
their race. This scenario is fright-
ening, but true . 

Of course, children do have 
choices to make about how they 
will live their lives; but they can 
only choose from the available 
options. Unfortunately, empower-

ment through education or em-
ployment are not often among the 
choices. Very few businesses other 
than liquor stores and fast -food 
restaurants are located in the in-
ner city. Schools in the ghetto are 
poor and cannot even provide a 
refuge from ghello violence. 

Yet despite the dismal condi-
tions, we somehow expect inner-
city youths to overcome poverty 
through "hard work. " But 
shouldn't it be our responsibility 
to end their poverty through our 
own "hard work?" 

Every aspect of their lives car-
ries a message of what the world 
thinks of them. The detrimental 
effects upon a child whose up-
bringing is dominated by the fear 
of violence at every inconsequen-
tial moment- even at the corner 
Jack-in-the-Box - are immeasur-
able. 

Ghetto conditions breed vio-
lence on a massive level. In 1992, 
4,728 black youths died from fire-
arms. Three-hundred twenty-three 
of those were under the age of 14. 

That same year, at a Los Ange-
les Freedom School in WIlliS -
where I was a site coordinator -
a 12-year·old student named 
Antoine, a.k.a. "Pookie," was 
stabbed in the chest and cut across 
the wrist in a schoolyard fight. 
With medical treatment, his body 
was healed, but that should be the 
least of our concerns. Pookie is an

Dallas Museum of Art Director 
Harry S. Parker, 111 , hailed the 
imaginative treatment of every-
day objects as a way of providing 
expression in a complex, modern 
society . 

"Elizabeth Murray has created 
art that speaks of honesty , courage 
and a willingness to take risks in 
giving artistic expression to 
today 's highly complex world ," 
Parker said. 

The shoe will be officially dedi-
cated as the 13th work in the col-
lection in a ceremony on Sunday, 
Feb. 25. Murray will then present 
a brief slide show at 3 p.m. in 
Galbraith Hall, room 1402. There 
will be a reception in the eucalyp-
tus grove near the sculpture imme-
diately following the presentation. 

Currently residing in New York 
City, Murray has two daughters 
and is married to poet Robert 
Holman. In addition to painting 
and sculpting, she has taught at . 
various institutions, including the 
Art Institute of Chicago, as well as 
Princeton and Yale universities. 

Murray's work is funded by pri-
vate collectors, exhibitions and 
grants from institutions such as 
the National Endowment for the 
Arts, which is also a major source 
of funding for the Stuart Collec-
tion.

"We are very interested in hear-

he said. "If there is any stonewalling 
going on, it will be perpetrated by

Although the suit asks that the 
regents' affirmative-action vote be 
nullified, Molloy said he is not su-

grams. 

"All we want is for any delibera-
tions on the issue to occur in pub-

occur behind closed doors or during 
non-public phone calls, then we 
think that there has been a violation

MARTIAL ARTS ACTION 
HERO JACKIE CHAN TESTS 
AMERICAN MARKET WITH 
RUMBLE IN THE BRONX 

ACKIE CHAN IS THE CLOS-
EST thing this world has to 
a super hero. Anyone who 
has witnessed his feats in 
one of the 40 or 

so foreign ftlnlS he's headlined during 
his two-decade-spanning ca-
reer will stir with excitement 
at the mention of the action-
comic maven. 

He simply amazes all. His 
appealisuniversal,mixingin-
novative, over-the-top kung-
fu gymna<;tics with cleverslap-
stick and entertaining physi-
cal comedy. Merely calling his movies 
"kung-fu" fIlms is an understatement 
in itself. They are best described sim-
ply as "Jackie Chan" films, for the 
world of action has not seen his equal. 

What he does is something only a 

stunt man could piece together. He 
brings a ftlm-JTlftking ethic to the ac-
tion genre which is part parsimony and 
part ostentation - he sets out to blow 
the socks off the viewer, while main-
taining a minjmali tic operation. 

The international-film mar-
ketplace basically divides be-
tween the West and the rest. 
Chan rules the "rest," as its 
most formidable cinema star. 
UntiJ now, he has existed as a 
veritable one-man army, left 
largely unnoticed in the West 
(those keen, below-the-sur-

face, special-interest fan groups not-
withstanding). 

Chan's methodology is nonnalJy 
rooted in a deep respect for his audi-
ence, never willing to insult its intelli-
gence with gaudy special effects which

eclipse the scope of the film. He only 
does what's necessary; and for a man 
who has broken every major bone in 
his body, his personal safety is clearly 
nol important. That is what comprises 
Chan's art, an uncompromising vision 
to integrate actor, director, producer, 
writer, stunt man, star and film into 
one reverential whole. 

On one level, hi latest fi 1m, RumbLe 
in the Bronx, promises to be another 
jewel in the crown of this martial-arts 
jack-~f-all-trades, as he attempts to go 
for broke in this, his second U.S.-
produced fLlm 

With Rumble In ehe Bronx, Chan 
has forsaken his fans and hi craft by 
turning out a fUm which can barely be 
watched. It's inane in its characteriza-
tions of New York gangsters, ones

a Slranded motoriSl, Marijo (Josiane Balasko), 
whose Volkswagon van - which formerly be-

longed to American hippies - has 
broken down. Loli doesn' t shy away 
from Marijo, who happens to be a 
lesbian, and engages readi Iy in a con-
versation about various sexual euphe-
misms.

Born in Paris in 1950, Balasko, an 

acclaimed actress, screenwriler and 
director, has starred in over 20 films 
in France, four of which she wrote and directed. 
While acting professionally, she realized she 
had a flair for comedy and decided to write and 
act. Her experience shows in French Twisl. 

Later in the film, after Laurent 
rushes off for a "business" meeti ng-
a characteristic rendezvous with one 
of his clients - Loli, feeling aban-

doned, eagerly welcomes Marijo as a dinner 
guest. Loli finds Marijo endearing and is at-
lractcd to her lesbian friend, leading to an even-
tual romance, which seems to grow only afler 
Laurent accidentally and disastrously discovers 
his wife's affair. 

Separated lover.: Loli (center) keeps her lesbian lover Marijo (left) and her husband 
Laurent (right) apart in French Twist. 

. From the associates at his real estate oflice to 
his chi Idren ' s young babysitter, Laurent LaFaye 
(Alain Chahal) cheals on his wife with any 
willing woman." French Twist takes Laurent's 
philandering for granted, though hinting at a 
constant love he still nurses for his unsuspecting 

Bctwccn a startling strcct fight and a lense 
kitchen brawl, Loli balances her new lover and 
her husband by splitting her time with each of 
them. Torrnenled by her discovery of both 

Laurcnt's and Marijo's ex-lovers, Loli realizes 
that loving two people might initially be fun, but 
it is ultimately draining. And just when a tidy 
resolution to the film seems in ordcr, the charac-
ters switch roles and take viewers through an-
OlhersctoftwislS. Consequently, each character 
must question the value of his or her love. 

However, to understand the movie only as a 

series of emotional discoveries belies its unique 
comedic ploy, in which sexual taboos are ex-
plored through humorous situations. In count-
less hilarious scenes, French Twist invites view-
ers to both ridicule and empathize with its char-
acters in sccnes of betrayal and friendships . 

French Twist opens tomorrow at thc Park 
Theater in Hillcrest.

CHAN: New film 
can't compare with 
past achievements 
Continued from page H9 
who ride di rt bikes through the 
city of New York. It ' s also absurd 
in its lack of respect for its audi-
ence, as Chan end s up prcaching 
to villains that they should turn 
over a new leaf and become good 
members of society . And it 's a l 0 
tired in its premise. Seeing lhis 
film for a few acti on thrills is not 
worth the convu lsi ve pain itclicits 
in any Chan fan who has grown 
accustomed to the innovative real -
ism of his previous movies. 

In RumbLe, Chan plays a hap-
less "Chi na man" on his first trip 
to the United States . Working in 
his uncle ' s grocery store in New 
York, he gets caught up in a lame, 
diamond-th iefring' s scheme and 
e nds up having to save not onl y 
himsel fbut also a paraplegic kid 
and a bad -girl gangster who re-
ally just wants to be good. 

What saves the viewer from 
total annoyance is the occasional , 
trademark Jackie Chan action se-
quences, on which the film is 
surprisingly short. But these 
sparse sequences are not enough 
to save the ship, which begins 
sinking the momenl Chan sets 
foot on U.S. soil. The parallel to 
his film career in this country is 
its own irony. 

It used lo be the case that a 
Chan film left one feeling ex-
hilarated and giddy , with theawe-
some demonstralion of aClion 
marvel which just passed before 
one's eyes. Rumble in the BrollX 
does no such thing. 

In fact, the movie leaves you 
feeling suckered by the suave 
advertising campaign which has 
been running at full tilt for the 
past few weeks. Chan is not a 
pre-sold commodity here like 
Sylvester Stallone or Arnold 
Schwarzeneger. It has taken a 
strategic ad campaign playing up 
his amazing stunt aptitudes to 
unleash the vinually unknown 
Chan into the lucrative U.S. film 
world . 

Rumble in the Bronx opens 
lomorr.ow at theaters throughout 
San Diego .

Not A Typical 
Gangster Film 

Director Gary Felder rewrites a 
genre with his Things to Do in 

Denver When You're Dead 
ay Corey B. Niles 
Guardian Rel)orter 

Things 10 Do in Dellver Wlletl 
YOII 're Dead is not a typi-
cal cri me movie. It 's an 
amalgamation of El more 
Leonard and Le Marte de 
Arthur, a grim medi tation 
on life, death, love and 
honor, set in the Denver 
underworld. It imitales the 
style of classicfilm 110ir in 
production and theme, yet 
it perverts the genre with a surreal 
sensibility echoing the brilliant and 
unsetlling films of Samuel Fuller. 

Things to Do chronicles 48 hours 
in the life of Jimmy the Saint (Andy 
Garcia), a charismatic gangster try-
ing togo legit The story begins when 
Jimmy is taken to see a paralyzed 
crime boss known only as the Man 
with the Plan (Christopher Walken). 
The Man with the Plan asks Jimmy to 
perform one last job for him, some-
thing Jimmy does not wanllodo. But 

after appealing to his sense of honor, 
Jimmy reluclantly agrees and calls his 
old gang together. 

Jimmy has a big car, 
expensi ve suits and slicked-
back hair, but he is no ordi-
nary gangster. He watches 
overthe Denverunderworld 
like a shepherd over his 
flock.. No one is too low for 
Jimmy. Even hi s crew con-
tains two misfits, an old 

,. cri.minal with leprosy 
(Christopher Lloyd) and lunatic nanled 
Crilical Bill ([reat· Williams). His 
compassion and honor is best illus-
trated in his relationship with a young 
prostitute (Fairuza Balk), showing that 
he makes every attempt to live the 
noble life. 

DespiteJimmy'shonombleefforlS, 
hi gang botches the job - botches it 
badly. The Man with the Plan sen-
tences everyone in the gang except 
Jimmy todiean extremely painful and 
slow death, sending a ghoulish and

TIle film is a particularl y amaling

an amazing job. Walken's chamctcr 
is more intriguing than his roles in 
films like Trrte Romance ,Search a lid 
Destroy and even PilIp Fic/ioll . And 
Williams' character is reason alone 

to see this film. 
This imaginative story has mueh in 

common with PilIp Fiction - eccen-

Life in a Small 
DutchTown 

Director Marleen Gorris depicts a 
village~fi charm in Antonia's Line 

By Cheryl Lyn 
Gullt'dilln Reporter 

An ensemble of eccentric charac-
ters create a profoundly 
human taleofjoy and tnlg-
edy in the Danish film, 
AnIOnW's Line. Directed 
by Marleen Gorris, the 
film has been nominated 
for an Academy A ward 
for Best Foreign Film. 

Antonia (Willeke van 
Ammelrooy), a woman in 
her late 80s, wakes one moming 
knowing she will die that same day. 
She recalls when she and her 16-
year-old daughter Danielle (Els 
Douermans) visited Antonia's dying 
mother. The film then nashes back to 
thal ti me, whenAntoniaretumedfrom 
a long absence to live again in her old 
village and introduce her birthplace 
to Oanielle. 

Antonia's interactions with the 
vi lIagc' s inhabitants acquaint us with 
an odd bunch of misfits, including 
Mad Madonna (Catherine Ten 
Bruggencale), who regularly howls 
at the full moon for her Protestant 
lover (Paul Koolj), and Crooked Fin-
ger (Mil Seghers), a reclusive genius. 

spring 
Break 
Airline! 

Several village members eventu-
ally fall in love, showing the most 
basic of human emotions and the 

personal nature of the film. 
Danielle finds a man solely 
to father a chi Id for her, and 
her daughter Therese 
(Veerle Van Overloop) 
turns out to be a child 
prodigy. 

While Therese estab-
lishes a lasting friendship 
with the other local genius, 

Crooked Finger, Oanielle falls in love 
with Lara (ElsiedeBrdUw), Therese's 
lulor. Meanwhile, Farmer Bas (Jan 
Decleir),aneighboringwidower,asks . 
for Antonia's han<! iii marriage. All 
these strange friends, and many more, 
gather under Antonia's roof and 
around her welcome table. 

From the entertaining insight of a 
child prodigy to Antonia's poignant 
farewell to her great-granddaughter, 
Antonia's Line spans a broad range 
of emotions. The movie raises one's 
spirits by naunting its quirkiness as 
something exquisitely human and 
beautiful. 

Antonia's Line is playing at the

The band's single redeeming 

quality to date is the lyrics of its 
single, "Underground," which pro-

shallow world of underground mu-

Uvlnc lerae: Adam Livingston (leading) posted the fastest time ever in the 
Mount Baldy HIli Climb on Saturday, as UCSD placed first overall. 

A leadout is a when 
a teammate sacrifices 
himself to help an-
other learn member 
win. The first rider 
wi II ride in front of 
the second, pulli ng 
him to the front of the 
pack with a only few 
hundred meters re-
maining . At full 
speed, the first rider 
slowly tires out, while 
the second cyclist -
who is relatively fresh 
- sprints around his 
teammate for the fin -
ish line with the ad-
vantage of being In 
front of the pack.

Climb Time Trial. 
Riders were timed as 
they rode to the top 
of 500-foot peak ; 

and, after superb rac-
ing, UCSO finished first overall, 
ahead of UC Santa Barbara and 
UCLA. 

On Saturday , the 9.7-mile 
course was conquered by UCSD's 
Adam Livingston in record time. 
His sub-43 minute time was the 

fastest ever clocked at the event. 
Tim Knudson finished fourth over-
all , only two minutes behind team-
mate Livingston . 

On the women's side, Katrina 
Berger was the fastest Triton rider, 
placing second overall in 
Saturday's competition. 

On Sunday, Livingston came 
to ride once again, winning the 
parking-lot criteri um by breaking 
away from two other riders . 

Erik Stauber also placed well, 
coming across the line in fourth 
overall by winning the field sprint 

field, consisting of 
about 40 riders, Dave Schurig 
placed second overall after a mas-
sive final sprint to the finish line. 

"The race was definitely diffi -
cult," Schurig said. "But the pain 
was sweet. Santa Barbara has some 
excellent criterium riders, but un-
fortunately for them, they were 
crushed in the sprint." 

Other highlight s included 
Chriss Lyons, Kristine Schwinof 
and Brittany Gassert , finishing 
first, second and third, respec-
tively .

Ult imat e Disc 

Last weekend marked the only 
home meet of the season for Ihe 
UCSO ultimate disc team, or as 

it is known on the 
field, the Air 
Squids. 

The La 
Jollans invited a myriad of com-
petition from around the state to 
compete in the annual President 's 
Weekend Tournament, entering 
two teams of its own into the 
action. 

UCSO 's A team had a great 
tournament, goi ng 4-1 in pre-
liminary round actiun on Satur-
day morning and afternooon and 
advancing to the semifinals, for 
the first time in any tourney this 
season, on Sunday. 

Saturday's pool play for the 
UCSD A team pitted it against 
five opponents, four of whom 
tasted defeat at the hands of the 
Air Squids. Arizona State was 
victim number-one, falling 13-
I. 

The UCSB B team, UCSC and 
Cal became the next three to go 
down versus the Squids, by 
scores of 13-9, 13-6 and 13-5, 
respectively . 

The final game of the day 
marked the only loss for UCSD, 
which fcll to the Stanford A team, 
13-2. 

The biggest win of the bunch 
was the triumph over Santa Cruz, 
a team which the Squids had been 
unable to conquer for the past 

at the 

few years. Several members of 
the UCSD disc crew stepped up 
big-lime 10 lead the way to vic-
tory. 

Matt Davis had one score, a 
pair of assists and three "Os" 
(when a player forces a turnover), 
while teammate Bryan Qualls 
also played solidly, notching 
three scores and two assists. 

Sunday 's quarterfinal action 
matched the Air Squids with Las 
Positas College, the team which 
knocked UCSD out of last year's 
tournament. 

The Squids enacted a mea-
sure of revenge by jumping out 
to a quick 5-0 advantage, cruIs-
ing to the win by a final tally of 
13-3. 

Chris Weaver was the best 
discer on the field for UCSO, as 
he collected three scores and 
three assists. 

Captain Ben Finkelor also 
helped lead the way for the 
Squids, as he dished out five as-
sists and did not have a single 
turnover. 

UCSD's weekend finall y 
came to a close agaillst the UCSB 
A tcam, which sucked the life 
from the Squids with a 15-5 win 
in the semifinals. 

The UCSD B tcam, which 
dubbed it elf SquId Lite, was sub-
sequently trounced by the com-
petition, losing all five of its 
games in Saturday's pool play.

Christian Heritage Bombs Tritons, 103-88 
BRICK CITY: Tritons struggle from the floor, while Christian Heritage lights it up to top UCSD. . 
By Mike Sunae 
Staff Writer 

The road-weary Tri tons got beat 
at their own game Tuesday night. 
UCSD staggered through the last 

of its five-game 
road swing, as the 
Christian Heritage 
College (CHC) 
Hawks out-ran and 
out-gunned the Tri -
tons en route to a 
103.-88 victory. 

"Christian Heri -
tage is a lot like us," Triton Head 
Coach Greg Lanthier said, of the 
deep Hawk roster. "Obviously, I 
think they were a lot more aggres-
sive than we were." 

In a game featuring a tempo 
which should have favored UCSD' s 
depth and three-point prowess, CHC 
dominated almost every facet of the 
game. 

The Hawks shot the ball ex-
tremely well on the evening, hilling 
more than half of their allempts from 
the floor and sinking 87 percent of 
their free-throw attempts. 

"They [attempted] 38 free 
throws, which was not good for us," 
Lanthier said. "And they made 33, 
which was even worse." 

The Tritons, who have relied 
heavily on defensive pressure to 
wreak havoc on their Division III 
opposition, had trouble with the 
swarming, full -court press of the 
NAIA Hawks. The CHC defense 
effectively disrupted the offensive 
continuity and focus of the Tri -
tons. 

Christian Heritage also played 
excellent half-court defense on the 
Tritons' go-to guy in the paint. 
UCSD center Mall Aune was held 
to 17 points on seven of 18 shooting 
and only pulled down six rebounds 
- four below his average. 

The Hawks also took the ball 
right at the 6'7" center on offense, 
hoping to get Aune in foul trouble. 
Their tactic worked, and Aune 
picked up his third personal with 
five minutes to' go in the first half. 
UCSD played the final minutes of 
the period with Aune saddled on the 
bench. 

"We did a poor job defensively," 
Lanthier said. ':W.e were a little Iaie. 
a little slow. Offensively, we were 
fine. We got our 90 points. Defen-
sively,l was not pleased." 

UCSD had lead by as much as 
three points briefly in the first half. 
The Tritons mounted a run to take

the lead, 31-28, on a technical foul 
shot, following a breakaway basket 
by Triton forward Mike Wall. 

The foul had been called on CHC 
Head Coach Art Wilmore, who had 
protested a "no-call" by the officials 
on a steal which led to Wall' s easy 
bucket. 

The Hawks didn 't let the techni-
cal slow them down, however, scor-
ing numerous easy baskets to take a 
49-40 lead at the intermission. 

CHC then stormed oul of the 
locker room with a 9-0 run to take 
further control of the game. 

"We didn ' t come OUI prepared to 
play in the first few minutes of the 
second half," Lanthier said of the 
Tritons' defensive mental lapses, 
which allowed the Hawks to break 

. the game wide open. 
Although UCSD put together 

some nice streaks, it couldn't hit 

drop underground." 
One bright spot for the 

Tritons was the play of sopho-
more guard Jason Jones. 
Jones had a breakout game 
for UCSD. coming ofr of the 
bench to score 23 points on 
seven of 13 shooting. Jones, 
who has been struggling as of 
late with an ankle injury, 
knocked down five three 
pointers. 

"My first few shots went 
down and gave me 'confi-
dence," Jones said. "I was 
able to get some open shots 
from the outside, so ( kept 
shooting." 

Mark Patterson/GuMdian 

' the outside shot consist~ntly, pre-
venting the team from getting any 
closer .than five points in the sec-
ond half. 

"No one plays at a high level for 
the whoh; 40 minutes," Lanthier 
said. "Bui even if you do have a 
mentallap'se, you have to get to the 
point where it only drops to a mini-
mal level. For us, we disappear and 

"Jones had his best game 
of the year," Lanthier said. 
"He's starting to get healthy 
again, and. hopefully, this 
will give him some confi-
dence and carry over to the 
off-season and next year. It's 
been hard fol"him to stay con-
sistent with his nagging inju-
ries." 

UCSD fell to 10- 14 with

ROYAL: UCSD 
tops Kingsmen 
Continued from pace 20 
three doubles showdowns were played 
out under the pro-set fonnat (one sel, 
first team to eight games wins), with 
the team recording the most wins 
earning one point. 

At number-one doubles. the Tri-
ton tandem of Dan Brounstein and 
Anthony Melicharek (who subbed for 
an injured Ben Becker) fell by an 8-6 
score to the top Cal Lutheran team of 
Mark Ellis and Brian Holloway. 

UCSD rebounded at the number-
three slot, taking the victory, 8-4, as 
Emil Mihet and Steve Shabel got the 
belterofKingsmen Krist jan Koik and 
James Ciuffo. 

The crucial contest was played out 
at the number-two position, where 
UCSD's Mike Wilson and Eric 
Steidl mayer came back from the dead 
to overcome a 7-2 deficit and snag a 8-
7 victory, garnering the all-important 
first point for the Tritons. 

'That was a great win, and it set 
the tone for the whole match," UCSD 
Head Coach Brian Tumer said. "From 
there we just rolled." 

That roll began at the bottom of the 
singles ladder, where the Tritons' su-
perior depth was more than evident. 
UCSD's number-four through -six 
singles players all routed their Cal Lu 
opponents in straight sets. Number-
si)( Rahul Batra ousted Ciuffo with-
out concedingasinglegame, 6-0,6-0. 

Mean whi Ie, teammates Mihet and 
Shabel, playing in the fifth and sixth 
slots, respectively, recorded quick 
victories. Koik was no match forMihet 
at number five, as UCSD took the 
win, 6-5, 6-2, while Shabel blasted 
OlatundeOfunsanmi, 6-2. 6-4,toeam 
the Tritons' fourth point of the match. 

The top-three singles slots were 
more hotly contested, as each of 
UCSD's top players lost his opening 
sel. Steidlmayerrebounded atthethird 
position, topping Holloway, 6-7, 6-1, 
6-1, while Wilson came back as well, 
taking the win, 3-6. 7-5, 6-4. 

The Tritons' only loss in singles 
came at the number-one slot. where 
Brounstein was bested by Ellis, 0-6, 
6-4,2-6. 

"Ellis is one of the top five players 
in the nation,"Tumer said. "He is two 
times better then the next player on 
their team, and everyone knows it." 

Despite having the best player on 
the court, Cal Lu was no match for 
UCSD's depth. 

"We were a lot deeper then them," 
Turner remarked. 'The deeper in the 
order we got,the stronger we were." 

The Tritons carried their success 
versus Cal Lutheran into the follow-
ing day's tournament. All the seeds 
progressed as expected. with four of 
the eight UCSD players in competi-
tion advancing tothe semifinal rounds. 
Brounstein, Mihet, Batra and Yung-
Ping Yeh a.1I reached thesemis in their 
respecti ve brackets before the tourna-
ment was called because of the in-
clement weather. 

While the toumament' s final stand-
ings were left undetermined, coach 
Turner and his squad did get a peek at 
what they have to contend with, in the 
hunt for a Regional NCAA bid. Ac-
cording to Turner, the top spot in the 
West, and the nation, is held by UC 
Santa Cruz. Redlands is currently the 
secood-bestteam, followed by UCSD. 

"Redlands is the tcam we're !rying 
to catch right now," Turner said. "I 
think we can definitely handle the 
other teams, but we are going to be 
practici"l to beat Redlands_" 

The first big showdown with the 
Bulldogs will come on March IS, II 
the Tritons head to RedIInds .

They will exit the playoffs early or

"Being a senior, I realized that it 
was this or nothing," Jeffries said. "I 
took a leadership role, but it was 
really cool because the tean! fol-
lowed. ( played really intense, and 
so did the rest 0 f the team. 1l1ose last 
three games gave us a whole new 
level of confidence." 

Those wins brought with them 
increased respect in the eyes of the 
NCAA r.mking committee, which 
rewarded the Tritons' efforts with a 
number-four standing in the region. 

"We were really excited [about 
our play in those lasllhree games)," 
Jeffries said. "But we got even more 
excited when [Head Coach Judy) 
Ma1onetokl us we were number four." 

That ranking is a well-eamed 
honor fora Triton team which ballied 
its way through one of the toughest 
schedule in the nation. Among the 
highly touted opponents which 
graced UCSD scorecards were lhe 
number-one team in the nation, De-
fiance, the number-one seed in the 
East Region, William Smith, and 
the number-two seed in the rnid-
Atlantic bracket. Scranton. 

Furthermore, the Trilons' 91 -80 
victory over William Smith in the 
UCSD Invitational in late Decem-
ber was thatteam's only loss of the 
year, as it finished at 21-1. Despite

falling to both Defiance and 
Scranton. the experience of playing 
these teams was not loS! on UCSD. 

This level of competition is in 
stark contrast to last year's sched-
ule, which inc1uded no top East COasl 
schools for the Tritons to test them-
selve agai nsl. 

"Teams in the East and Midwest 
playa different style," Jeffries said. 
'They play rough, and they playa 
lot more aggressi ve on defense." 

Last season's trip to Minnesota 
for the first round of the NCAA 
Championship - and a battle with 
the nation' S number-one lean! -
was therefore quite a shock to the 
UCSD squad, and they did not re-
spond to the challenge as well as 
hoped. This year's experiences, how-
ever, have better prepared 'the Tri-
tons to baltle the nation's top teams. 

"In our tournament [in Dec.I, we 
[played tough defense]," leffriesex-
plained. "We weren' t ready for tile 
game against Defiance mentally, but 
after playing them, we pulled it to-
gether. We're ready for the tough 
teams in the tournament this year." 

Theofficial announcement ofthe 
brackets and host teams will come 
on Sunday night. If all goes well ror 
the Tritons, Feb. 28 will marie the 
first time in UCSD history that the 
women's basketball tean! has hosted 
an NCAA playoff game. Beyond 
that, it 's anybody's gu'ess what will 
happen. But with the expcriences of 
this year under their belts, the Tri-
tons are ready for all-comers.

A Shout Out to 
TheNBA 

This year's NationaJ 
Basketball Association season 
has fulfilled all promises of 
being an entertaining year for all 
of us hoop fans. Topics like the 
return of Air Jordan and Magic 
Johnson have kept us buzzing 
over their talent - and the 
controversies they generate. 

We've been bombarded via 
satellite by the next generation 
of players, led by Penny 
Hardaway and Grant Hill. The 
skills of these Generation X-men 
have been capitalized on by their 
sponsors, who cash in on the 
consumer's desire to "be like 
Mike ... pr Penny ... or Hill." 

While sponsors hope the new 
stars can match the marketability 
of Jordan and Magic, these 
young ball players have been 
lighting up NBA scoreboard , 
asserting that they are not the 
future: They are the present. 

The NBA has grabbed the 
pro sports throne vacated when 
the Cowboys won the Super 
Bowl and, thus, began football's 
hiatus. College basketball just 
doesn't haye the same competi-
tive flavor until the NCAA 
Tournament, and it's way too 
soon to start taking baseball. 

Sounds like a good time to 
discuss some of the ripples in the 
wake of the first half of the

AGAIN: The Tritons could not stop their losing streak, allowing four early runs in a loss to Chapman 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

When is it going to end? The 
UCSD baseball team asked itself 
that question following a 5-3 loss to

tons haven ' t been able to put it all 
together. During Tuesday's contest, 
however, it was one pitch that failed 
UCSD. 

With Chapman ahead, 1-0, in the 
second inning, Triton starting pitcher 
David Takehara found himself in a 
jam: bases loaded, one out - the 
perfect time for a strike-oul. 
Takehara got his wish, but he was 
unable to retire the side. 

crush the ball, but lately the other 
team seems to be able to find all the 
holes in the UCSD outfield. Sud-
denly, Chapman was ahead, 4-0. 

"We know we have the capabili-
ties to win these games," senior third-
baseman Carl Abramson said. "All 
we need to do is get one break; 
whether it's an error by the other 
team or a bloop hit." 

Head Coach Robert Fletcher said. 
"Overall. we didn ' t do that bad. II 
was just that one let-down in the 
second inning. U's just a continua-
tion of what we've been doing the 
past couple of weeks."

streak on Saturday, as the team hosts

The Tritons, despite punching 
out 10 hits, could not overcome the 
early deficit. And defense couldn't 
be blamed for the loss; UCSD made 
only one error in the field. 

"I honestly wish we could playa 
doubleheader," Fletcher said. 'I'm 
prelly sure that we're focused 
enough to play well on Saturday. I 
think you have to create your own 
breaks and we 're just not playing 
well enough to get any breaks."

oThe Chicago Bulls have a 

chance to break the all-time

Tritons Hoping to Host 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Few would argue that the UCSD women's 
basketball team is a veteran squad. With only one 
senior providing leadership, the Tritons don't 

have the experience typical of most 
championship-caliber squads. 
That hasn't stopped the team, how-
ever, from tearing through its 
1995-96 season schedule en route 
to an all-but -official NCAA berth. 

... will have his days in the sun. 

The Tritons battled Cal Lu team-to-
team on Friday afternoon, then be-
gan Saturday's opening rounds of 
the Cal Lutheran Invitational Tour-
nament. Unfortunately, the tourna-
ment progressed no further than the 
semifinals, due to rain. 

After securing key wins in their 
final three regular-season contests, 
the Tritons rose from sixth to fourth 

in the West rankings, affording themselves an 
excellent opportunity to host an opening-round 
game. Those important wins were sparked by the 
outstanding play of the squad' s lone senior, Marcia 
Jeffries. It may be a cliche to say that leaders step 
up when it counts, but it is players like Jeffries 
who make the cliche ring true, time and again. 

• 

The Tritons' match-up with the 
Kingsmen on Friday was a good 

early season gauge of where they stand in the world 
of Division ill tennis in California. UCSD passed 
with flying colors, recording a 6-1 triumph over its 
rivals. 

oThe Worm. Dennis 
Rodman, shed his cocoon he 
lived in for two years with San 
Antonio and has become
