Revelle Gets Snowed In 
PLAYFUL: Sunday's event brought 24,000 pounds of snow to UCSD 

News Editor 

Twenty-four thousand 
pounds of Snow blanketed the 
kevelle Field Sunday in the sec-
ond annual Revelle Snow Day. 

The event, which was held 
from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., drew 
dozens of students, mostly 
Revelle residents. Dougtuwts 
and hot chocolate were served, 
and a band was on hand to pr0-
vide music, despite some initial 
problems finding a power 
aource. 

Last year's snow day, which 
was hela in Revelle Plaza, won 
an award for bema the most 
aoc:ial event put on 'J,y the resi-
dent advisors. 

This year's event was fund-
ed by the ReveUe College 

Council, Revelle subcommittees 
and a Dean's fund that encom-
passes all five colleges. 

Organizers originally went 
to the A.S. Councif for funding. 
Josh Ebrahemyoon, ReveHe 
sophomore senator and a 
Revelle resident advisor, said 
he thought he could receive 
A.s. Council funding because 
the event was a campuswide 
event not limited to Revelle stu-
dents. 

A.s. President Tesh KhuUar, 
however, vetoed funding the 
event because organizers 
already received funding from 
the Revelle College Council. 
Since the A.B. Council already 
funds the Revelle College 
Council, it is considered "dou-
ble dipping" to receive funding 
from both councils. 

Khullar said that the prima-
ry function of the A.s. Council 
is to fund student organiza-
tions. 

"Our student organizations 
are our primary concern 
because they have no other out-
let for money," he said. "When I 
give money to the college coun-
dis at the beginning of the.year, 
it is so they can plan their 
events for the year." 

Ebrahemyoon. said the col-
leges should be able to receive 
AS. Council funds if they put 
on campuswide events. 

"The whole double-dipping 
issue is just retarded because 
now no individual college can 
throw a huge event and get A.S. 
funding," Ebrahemyoon said.

TeSS Gets 
the Axe for 
StudentUnk 
DECISION: Starting 
Sept. 1, all students will 
have to use WebReg 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Beginning this fall, students 
will no longer be able to register 
for classes using the university's 
telephone enrollment system, 
TeSS, and will instead have to use 
Student Link. The change will 
save the university $28,000. 

"We are planning on dropping 
(telephone registration) as of 
Sept. 1 and asking students to use 
the Web specifically," said 
Richard Backer, associate vice 
chancellor of enrollment manage-
ment, and registrar. 

Backer said he made the deci-
sion in consultation with students 
and administrators after seeing 
the increasing popularity of stu-
dents registering for classes over 
the Web. 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
said he did not pledge his full 
support to the elimination of tele-
phone registration. 

"I was hesitant when Dr, 
Watson first told me about it," he 
said. "I think [Web registration] 
is the wave of the future but I 
think that until it's assured that 
everyone knows about it and 
everyone has equal access to it, 
phone registration should not be 
eliminated." 

Khullar added that although 
he personally uses the Web to reg-
ister for classes, it will not be as 
convenient for students who do 
not have lnternet access from 
home or work. 

Backer said, however, that 
when registering for winter quar-
ter 'classes this year, only 3,474 
students registered via telephone, 
compared to 14,592 students who 
used the Web.

the program in an effort to raise 
awueness about increuiJ1g inci-
dents of hate on campus. 

The campaiSn tIas enlisted 
the support of campus groups 
such as the A. S. CounCil, the 

Cross Cultural Center, the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Resource Center, 
the Office of Religious Affairs, 
Office for Students with 
Disabilities, Student Legal 
Services, and all five colleges to

"Unity in Diversity" art project, 

with the campaign culminating 
in a Hate-Free Campus 
Campaign Proclamation Event to 
take place on April 24, where 
actor Edward James Olmos will 
speak. 

The workshops and other 
informative events are an impor-

to talk about especially with the

Candidates Contemplate Slogans to Sway Voters' Decisions 
COMMINTARY: As the all-important Super Primary approaches on March 7, slogans are short and concise messages that 
all candidates must successfully phrase in order to leave a lasting impression on voters 
By DAVID YIN 
Senior Staff ..mer 

There is one general rule that 
aU politicians and aspiring politi-
cians learn when playing the pop-
ular game "Who wants to be a 
President?" It is that people, for 
the most part, have very short 
attention spans. 

The average American voter, 
more concerned with what's for 
dinner than who has the better 
health care plan. does not want to 
hear to-point-plan planks and 
~ific budget configurations. 
They want it short, simple and 
sweet. They want something that 
sticks in tf\eir head and doesn't 
take too much effort to compre-
hend. Thus, the campaign s10gan 
wasbom. 

The most important thing for 
a presidential candidate to do is 
connect with voters. What does 
that mean? In states whose pri-
maries come early, such as Iowa 
and New Hampshire, that 
means going door to door, hold-
ing town hall meetings and sign-
ing autographs at the mall. Sure, 
people may knock Iowa and 
New Hampshire for not being 
representative of the nation 
(which they're not), but at least 
they force the candidates to 
interact with people in a way 
other than through that little 
metal box in America's living 
room. 

However, with the ampaip 
moving coast to coast, connect-
ing with voters takes on a new 
meaning. No longer able to 
remain stationary in one town or 

village, candidates must rely on 
sound bites and media clips. 
They need something that grabs 
attention and tells people some-
thing about their campaign that 
will distinguish it frOm all the 
others. Many presidential hope-
fuls have tried and failed . When 
you choose a slogan, you're rret-
ty much stuck with it. There s no 
second chance to make a good 
first linpression. 

As we near the March 7 Super 
Primary (14 states including 
California), let us evaluate how 
candidates George W. Bush, John 
McCain, Al Gore, Bill Bradley 
and Steve Forbes have fared with 
their choices of campaign 
themes. 

The Bush ampaign chose 
"Prosperity with a Purpose" as its 
slogan. By most asaessments, it 
was a wise choice. After all, in a 
nation with astounding economic 
growth and record-breaking 
stock markets, people want to see 
other perspectives. Perhaps there 
is some greater purpose to being 
wealthy, but there are two liabili-
ties with this message. 

First of all, does anyone really 
think Bush believes in this con-
cept? In the last couple of months 
of campaigning, all he has talked 
about are tax cuts, education and 
more tax cuts. Sometimes he still 
speaks about being a "compas-
sionate conaervative," and many 
people mistake this for his cam-
paign slogan. This is bad because 
the dominant analysis is that 
"compassionate conservative" 
means most other conaervative 
Republicans are just cold-hearted

and mean. Only Bush is different. 
This is not a good message for an 
already overly cocky candidate to 
send. 

The second problem is that, as 
sad as it may be, many Americans 
may not understand what "pros-
perity with a purpose" really 
means. To them, It seems like typ-
ical political jargon with some 
nifty alliteration. People do not 
necessarily want to think, and 
Bush's slogan requires some pon-
dering. Back to rule number one 
- keep it simple. 

Moving on to McCain, this 
f1avor-of-the-month does not 
really need a catchy slogan (and 
he doesn't have one). So far, the 
name of his campaign tour bus, 
"Straight Talk Express," has 
attracted favorabfe mention 
around the country and has 
done more for him than any slo-
gan ever could. It probably does 

not hurt that the media has vir-
tually unlimited access to the 
candidate aboard this bus . 
McCain's reputation for being a 
straight shooter won him the 
image as a mix between George 
Washington and Teddy 
Roosevelt; he never tells a lie, 
and he carries a big stick. 

For the record, McCain's actu-
al slogan is "The character to do 
what's right, and the courage to 
do it." This is very consistent with 
the his campaign themes but way 
too long. A better slogan would 
have been "McCain. Character ... 
Courage ... Compassion." This 
gets to the point more quickly 
and gives people something to 
remember. Better yet, McCain 
could tattoo a picture of the state 
of New Hampshire on his fore-
head with a giant "V" for victory 
next to it. 

On the Democratic side, Gore 
wants to fight .for you. He wants 
to fight for your education, your 
health care, working families and 
poor farmers (though only in 
Iowa, it seems). Above all, he will 
literally fight anyone that stands 
in his way to the Democratic 
nomination. Therefore it makes 
sense that Gore's theme is 
"Fighting for Us." 

Core's slogan is not a bad 
one, but it fails in one regard: It 
doesn't present Gore as his own 
person. Every candidate will tell 
you that he or she Will fight for 
you. Every candidate has the 
ability to wage a fight and claim 
to represent the people's best 
interests. But what makes Gore 
more capable of fighting the 

good fight than McCain, Bradley 
or Bush? To maximize his poten· 
tial, Gore should have included 
something about his experience. 
Anyone can show up for the 
main event, but not everyone 
has been in the ring for eight 
years. 

Bill Bradley has the most 
upbeat, the Simplest, but perhaps 
aJso the most questionable slo-
gan: "It Can Happen." What can 
happen, Bill? Here, there are 
many interpretations. First, there 
is the obvious choice of electing 
Bradley president. It can happen, 
but the question is why. Why 
should we make it happen? Then 
there is the concept of running a 
different campaign, a campaign 
not based on "politics as usual." 
It can happen. Well, so far it has 
not happened, although that is 
due more to AI Gore's attacks 
than any vindictiveness from the 
Bradley camp. 

What Bradley envisions "It 
Can Happen" to mean does not 
seem to have completely resonat-
ed with voters. He means we can 
achieve an America with better 
ideals and better citizens con-
stantly striving to better them-
selves and to help their fellow 
man. He means an America will-
ing and able to enact reasonable 
health care access, gun control 
and campaign finance reform 
policies. These things can hap-
pen. That's what Bradley is trying 
desperately to convey. 

Perhaps the candidate with 
the best slogan is the one who

has dropped out of the presiden-
tial race. That's right, Forbes, 
come on down! Forbes actually 
has some good, or at least 
thoughtful, ideas. His plan for a 
flat tax was endorsed by many 
leading economists and re-pacJ(-
aged by other candidates as their 
own tax plan. 

The media, however, has been 
merciless with Forbes. In many 
circles, he is known as the rich 
guy with an evil alien smile who 
is trying to buy himself an elec-
tion. This is not very fair. 

Forbes' slogan is "He wants 
you to win." This is a solid slogan 
because it accomplishes two 
things. First, it involves the pea-

economy, especially for the floral 
industry and generally makes a 
lot of people happy, mentally, 
emotionally and even physically. 
However, for the rest of us, 
Valentine's Day is simply another 
reminder of how tortured our 
love lives are and how fattening 
chocolate truffles can be. This hol-
iday needs an antidote - per-
haps Bitter Losers' Day, when 
everybody who didn't receive 
flowers and chocolates from a 
loved one can be linked in cele-
bration around the nation with 
dead roses and half-eaten, rasp-
berry-filled chocolates. 

If you find yourself wasting

edge that there is at least one

have been used as more ammuni-

tiatives and to discuss his vision

In the end, hopefully, voters 
decide based upon the issues 
and leadership qualities of can-
didates rather than their slo-
gans. However, the right slogan 
may divert attention to one per-
son. while the wrong one diverts 
attention from someone else.

first step in a long journey, but it 
just may shape the rest of the 
campaign.

Families on Edge of Spotlight IRAN: Other nations may 
follow suit 

their own. Yes, some things in our 
house are old and decaying, and 
we have to throw them in the 
trash." 

Lazara Brito and her three chil-
dren huddled over the kitchen 
table in their Havana, Cuba, 
apartment on a recent day and 
thumbed through a pile of letters 
and drawings. These scraps of 
paper have been the only physical 
link to Brito's husband, Jose 
Cohen, who left Cuba on a raft in 
1994 and has been waiting in vain 
for them to join him in Miami. 

"The important thing in life is 
not what you know or who you 
know," Brito read from one let-
ter, "but who you are." 

That may be the cause of her 
family's plight, since her hus-
band used to work for the 
Ministry of the Interior gather-
ing intelligence on foreign 
investors interested in doing 
business in Cuba, and so the 
govE'rnment considers him a 
deserter, or worse. 

Although Brito and her chil-
dren have had U.S. visas since 
1998, she said the Cuban govem-
ment had retaliated aga.inst her 
husband by not aUowing them 
to emigrate and subjecting them 

to harassment and intimidation. 
The Cohens are among hun-

dreds of Cuban families stuck in 
a limbo of politics and bureaucra-
cy, holding travel documents that 
remain useless without exit visas 
from the government. Many of 
them had become even more 
frustrated over the situation in 
recent months as they watched 
the daily Cuban protests 
demanding the return of Elian 
Gonzalez to his father in Cuba. 

"It has been almost six years 
since he left," Brito said of her 
husband. "Since then, the whole 
family has felt the full rancor of 
the officials. I see all the worry 
over the child EMn and I ask. 
where is the love for my chil-
dren, because for six years my 
children have been paying for 
the rancor against my husband." 

State Department officials 
had no exact figures on how 
many families were being kept 
apart, but they said that last 
year approximately 1,700 pe0-
ple with valid travel documents 
for the United States were 

For Bradley, Contest 
is a Three-Way Race 

SAN JOSE, Calif. -In a speech 
to Califomia Democrats on 
Saturday, former Sen. Bill Bradley 
had just reached the part where he 
usually contrasts himself with Vice 
President Al Gore, when he 
swerved into new territory and 
began drawing distinctions 
between hlmself and a Republican, 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 

"John McCain, he's moving in 
the polls, even getting some 
Democratic support," Bradley said. 
"Why do you think that is?" Then 
he proceeded to tick off the reasons 
good Democrats should not like 
McCain, from his opposition to 
abortion and gun control to his 
support for school vouchers. 

Bradley's quick pivot from 
Gore to McCain showed that he is 
suddenly fighting a two-front 
war: against Gore for core 
Democratic voters and against 
McCain for the hearts and minds 
of independents who are impor-
tant in states like California and 
Washington that vote on March 7. 

Throughout the campaign, 
polls have shown that Bradley and 
McCain perform well among inde-
pendent voters, who seem attract-

TRUMP: 
Ventura also quit 
reform party Friday 
ConthMNd fronI ..... 1 
developer bitterly denounced the 
divisions that have publicly beset 
the Reform Party in recent 
months, which he described as 
"general fratricide." 

Trump's decision came one 
day after a Reform Party faction 
backed by Ross Perot, which 
strongly opposed the prospect of 
Trump as the party's presidential 
candidate, ousted a faction 
aligned with Gov. Jesse Ventura 
of Minnesota, who was close to 
Trump. Ventura <}uit the party on 
Friday, calling it dysfunctional." 

Trump asserted in his state-
ment that he believed he could 
win the party's nomination if he 
chose to pursue it. 

However, he said, "the prospect 
of divisive lawsuits, continued 
fighting over the national conven-
tion site and general fratridde" had 
convinced him that the Reform 
Party nominee, whoever it may be, 

ed to their insurgent messages. 
Both claim to be outsiders fighting 
the establishment, both staunchly 
advocate getting big money out of 
politics, and both cast themselves 
as plain-spoken alternatives to 
slick, poll~riven front-runnets. 

Earlier in the campaign, 
Bradley's aides argued that th 
were enough independent vot-
ers for both candidates. No 
longer. Since McCain scored a 
19-point victory over Gov. 
George W. Bush in New 
Hampshire, largely on the 
strength of independent voters, 
Bradfey's advisers have conced-
ed that McCain's rising popular-
ity could draw crucial indepen-
dent votes away from Bradley. 

Nin New Hampshile, a lot of 
JleOPle were saying they couldn't

"1 have consistently stated that 

I would spend my time, energy 
and money on a campaign, not 
just to get a large number of 
votes, but to win," Trump said in 
the statement. "There would be 
no other purpose, other than win-
ning, for me to run. I have there-
fore decided not to seek the pres-
idential nomination of the 
Reform Party." 

Trump's imminent departure 
would appear to leave Pat 
Buchanan, the conservative com-
mentator, as the leading prospect 
to win the Reform Party's back-
ing - provided that Perot does 
not decide to make a third go at it. 

The new interim head of the 
Reform Party, Pat Choate, 
described Trump as a "hustler"

never believed that Trump had 
any interest beyond promoting 
himself and a new book that hap-
pened to be published at exactly 
the time he started his light

For some, like the Cohens, the 

delay is political. Many are held 
up by what foreign diplomats 
said were excessive Cu6an fees 
for medical exams and adminis-
trative costs - as much as 51,000

the average salary is $10 a

because a noncustodial parent 
refuses to give permission Jor his 
child to reave the country, or 
because the would-be immi-
grant is a rrofessional who must 
first fulfil a work commitment 
in return for education. 

NIt is a big aspect of this 
whole Cuban trauma," said Max 
Castro, a senior research analyst 
at the University of Miami. "This 
is a good moment to 'reflect on it 
and for the various parties to be 
more consistent. There is no

Microsoft Faces Skeptical 
Market in Releasing Windows 

MENLO PARK, Calif. - Will 
the dogs eat the dog food? It is 
a way of wondering whether 
the customers will accept the 
product. And among the elite 
corps of Microsoft program-
mers who labor to tum out each 
new operating system. the dOl 
food aphorism has become i 
wa~ of life. 

On the eve of the official 
release of Windows 2000, the 
software giant's first new busi-
ness-oriented operating system 
in four years, a growing rum-
bling among early users and 
analysts suggested that 
Windows 2000 might not be a 
runaway success. The compa-
ny's stock fell nearly 6 percent 
on Friday, closing at 99 15/16, 
after a Gartner Group report 
indicated that a significant 
number of existing programs 
used by large corporations 
would not be compatible with 
Microsoft's new operating sys-
tem. 

Moreover, on Thursday 
night, during a conference call 

held by Dell Computer to dis-
cuss earnings with analysts, the 
company's founder and chair-
man, Michael S. Dell, threw 
more cold water on the 
Windows 2000 launch, saying 
!)ell did not expect a :.,..boost in 
the near future from of the 
new 0rrating system. 

StH, Microsoft has faced a 
skeptical media and industry 
numerous times before, and the 
company has almost always 
managed to outpace expecta-
tions. 

On Thursday, at a planned 
gala in San Francisco, Microeoft 
will officially introduce what are 
in fact four different operating 
systems aimed at different mar-
kets: desktop office users, 
Internet and other network serv-
er applicatiOns, and, four 
months hence, a data center ver-
sion that for the first time will 
permit Microsoft to compete in 
the very high end of the comput-
er business. 

Windows 2000 boasts a huge 
array of advanced features -

the user document describing 
the product is 2S3 pages -
intended to put Microsoft on an 
even footing with the Unix oper-
ating systems that dominate cor-
porate back offices. 

NWindows 2000 acceptance 
will be very, very large. II predict-
ed Mark Anderson, a computer 
industry analyst and president 
of Technology Alliance Partners. 
"The replacement rate" of Unix-
based systems, he said, "will go 
to four-t<M>ne or better." 

Underscoring Anderson's 
optimism Is a Ieature lilt for 
Windows 2000 that begins with 
its ability to handle larger tasks 
- in industry parlance, "to 
scale" - running on computers 
based on as many as 32 proces-
sors. Such systems have 
increasingly replaced main-
frame computers during the 
past decade and are now used 
extensively in corporate com-
puting centers.

Bush's Campaign Polling Becomes ~ Issue 
HOUsroN - Nearly 1,000 

miles from South Carolina and 
the bitter political war between 
George W. Bush and John 
McCain, one flank of the war is . 
being fought from a four-story 
office buirding in the northern 
suburbs of this dty. 

Up on the top floor, inside the 
offices of a company called Voter 
Consumer Research, a few dozen 
people, from college students to 
grandmothers, spent two days 
last week calling prospective vot-
ers in.South Carolina to ask them 
carefully . scripted questions. 
They began innocuously ~: 
Will you participate in the 
Republican primary? How much 
attention have you paid to the 
GOP race? Are thinas better or 
worse in the countryf 

The questions qUickly shifted 
to Mc.<:aJn. and the tone became 

• 1ess innocuo\lll: In the guile of 
introducing questions, the callers 
stated that McCain's tax plan 
does not cut rates for most pe0-
ple. that he had been reprimand-
ed by the Senate EthIcs 
Committee and that his campaign 

finance proposals would give 
labor unions and the media more 
influence in deci~ elections. 

What kind of poD Is this? One 
written by the Bush campaign. 
The people conducting it were 
not starry-eyed campaign volun-
teers but Were paid by the hour, 
not much more than minimum 
wage. 

In an irlcreasinsJy nasty pri-
mary in which each cimdidate has 
blamed the other for the nasti-
ness, the usually obscure role of 
telephone canvassing and polling 
has unexpectedly become a cen-
tral issue as hundreds of thou-
sands of calls pour down on vol-
~ in South carolina. McCain has 
complained that Bush and his 
suWOrters are conducting a thin-
ly aisguised telephone smear 
campaign, a charge the Texas 
governor vehemently denies. 

they are conducting a real poll, 
when they are actually posing 
questions that spread doubts 
about the opponent - is known 
as Npush polling." 

Art Fleischer, a Bush 
spokesman. said McCain and oth-
ers had mistakenly confused the 
Bush campaign's use of Nadvoca_ 
cy calling" -~ to drum 
up support - with its polling. 
Fleischer said the campaign had 
made 200,000 advocacy calls into 
South Carolina, in which callers 
read a script esaentialJ blaming 
the negative tenor of ~ race on 
Mc:Cain, and then ask if the 
respondent would vote for Bush. 

Michael W. lkaugott, presi-
dent of the American 
AS8Ociation for ~blic Opinion 
Research. said that push polling 
Is designed either to persuade 
people to change from one can-
didate to another or to supprea 
an opponent's vote by tarrilShing 
his reputation in the eyes of his 
supporters.

SNOW: 
Organizers hoped to 
double snow amount 
eo.tIII .... "... ..... 1 

The snow for this year's 
event cost $2,000. An addItional 
$1,000, the amount sought from 
the A.S. Council, would have 
allowed for double the amount 
of snow. 

Michele Uglesich, a Revelle 
RA, said that because the event 
was a success, the lack of funding 
was irrelevant. 

"We no longer like to discuss 
that," she said. "We like to enjoy 
the event. In the beginning we 
wanted it to be bigger and better, 
but they're having a good time 
and that's all that matters."

dragged into the snow by stu-
dents and in his second change of 
clothes by 2 p.m. 

He saId most Revelle students 
were unusually playful at the 
event. 

"This is one of the most social 
events I've seen at Revelle," 
Scotto said. "For two hours they 
get to forget about organic 
chemistry. This is truly a study 
break." 

Most of the afternoon consist-

dragged into the snow by their

said. "Most of these are my resi-

lem with your RA, come to the

Nguyen'said her' personality 
may be why she was such a pop-

"I'm a very vocal person," she 
said. "My residents realize this. 
I'm a person who likes to play so

HATE: 
Number of crimes

ContInued from ..... 1 
bring much-needed change. 

"What's great about the cam-
paign is that it came from concern 
from the students and communi-
ty about hate crimes and it has 
become a real collaborative 
effort," said Gary Anderson, pro-
gram coordinator for the Office of 
Religious Affairs. "We're working 
with the visual arts department 
to produce a documentary about 

the subject. We're also in commu-
nication with other UCs. We hope 
that this idea of hate crime educa-
tion will spread." 

Adam. Jeffers, a campaign 
coordinator, said that the nature 
of hate crimes is changing. 

"Hate crimes are up and 
they' re being reported, but there's 
a lot that is not being reported," 
Jeffers said. "I think the bigger 
problem is biased incidents. I have 
stacks of hate e-mail that have 
been sent to certain students with 
the sender's name on them and 
right now the university doesn't 
have a policy to deal with that." 

A hate crime is described as 

The UCSD Guardian 

"an act of hostility or violence 
committed against a person or 
group because of their race, eth-
nicity, gender, age, disability, sex-
ual orientation or political beliefs 
which constitutes a crime and can 
be punished as such." 

A biased motivated incident, 
however, encompasses non-threat-
ening name calling and hate-mail, 
which only violate UCSD's princi-
ples of community, leaving the vic-
tim with no legal recourse. 

"Some people may not think 
that biased incidents are a crime," 
Jeffers said. uIt really depends on 
the individual and how they are 
affected by it. These are the things 

we want to educate the students 
about and, of course, to get them 
to report crimes of hate. Silence is 
a kind of acceptance. People see 
things and they don't say any-
thing about it, and that's like 
encouraging the perpetrator." 

Currently, a Human Relations 
Advisory Board made up of 
members of the UCSD communi-
ty and the outside community 
looks into ways that UCSD can 
become better at responding to 
people affected by hate crimes. 

''The board is also looking into 
a plan that would allow students 
to report things that have hap-
pened without going to the police 

Thrn this break into a 'real trip. With over 700 airlines, 
in excess of 45,000 hotels, and more than 50 rental car companies, 

it's easy to find an incredible deal even on a student's budget.

because sometimes they are leery 
about that," Anderson said. "It 
will also make it easier to report 
things that have happened even if 
they don't rise to the level of hate 
crimes." 

There are many ways students 
can get involved with the cam-
paign, including through a con-
test to come up with a catchy slo-
gan for the campaign.

Day can be 

hazardous for

plan. If at this

empty for 

ideas, check

By DAVID LIE 
Senior St"" wnrer 

Last minute planning is an art, a delicate craft which 
blends procrastination with innovation. Unfortunately, 
man)' mislabel last minute artists as lazy or irresponsi-
ble. Call it penis envy, these critics all share one com-
mon trait - the inability to plan at the last minute. But 
those who do understand the intricades of this art also 
understand its narcotic addiction. The further the wait, 
the further the intensity. Adrenaline supercharges your 
senses for those sweet hours until you can find your 
hallelujah moment. 

And for those artists in lelationshi ,Valentine's Day 
can be as Invigorating as it can be ~ting. The frus-
tration lies in the holiday's CQmJneJ'Cialism. Just about 
every "romantic" place requlIes a reeervation for this 
pocket-pillaging day. Even roees, freaking dead flowers, 
demand pre-orders since most shops sell out by morning. 

In response to this dilemma, this article offers an 
inventive approach at tackling Valentine's Day. One of 
the biggest Valentine's problems can be attributed to 
every nook and cranny of the city being crammed with 
couples galore. Finding a little so~tude can be more pre-
cious than gold. Therefore, one the best places to visit on 
Valentine's Day is the most anonymous city in the 
world - Los Angeles. 

That's right, our neighbor to the north is probably 
one of the best cities to get lost in. What better canvas for 
the last minute artist to work in than a Tec:hnicolor behe-
moth. offering everything the professional hedonist 
desires from lingerie lace to tranasexual sea monkeys. 
But, the key to LA. is knowing where you're going. ft's 
a city of stwks and hesitation means certain death. In 
fact, that's how most Angelinos recognize tourists with 
their "cauKht in the headliRhts" expression. L.A:s 
romance Is lound In its ambivalent attitude. It is the cra-
dle to the ·whatever" generation. And as long as you're 
doing something or pretending to do !IOR\ething, people 
really don't care. Here are lOme things to do. 
........ 

DrivinS is part of the Los Angeles experience. Its 
IWiCellity invorw. both ..r.ty and convenience. Addi-
tionally, loI~ Is not a compId town, but a sprawl-
ing grOwth of dispetlte c:ommunities. Consider what the 
city of angels is home g Beverly Hills, Hollywood, 
VeNce BeaCh. Chinatown, UttIe 'JbkYo, Encino, East LA., 

FEATURES II 

Melrose Ave. and South Central to name just a few of its 
formidable faces. Los Angeles' eclectic body is driven 
through the arteries of its highways and surface streets. 
For the last minute planner, driving through L.A. offers 
an opportunity to let inspiration s~e naturally through 
the city's beautiful scenery. One particular street that 
offers a veritable slideshow of beautiful architecture and 
eye candy is Sunset Boulevard, where you can cruise 
from the glitzy clubs of the Westside through the Malibu 
Canyons and into the beach. Rent a convertible and drive 
With the top down to get a dose of the city's posh glam-
our and artificiality. Of course, not everything in Los 
Angeles is a drive-by event, particularly, its restaurants.

The best hot dogs ever created, this is one of L.A.'s

That's right - chicken and waffles, yum yum give me 
some. It soUnds like a bad joke, but Roscoe's only serves 
chicken and waffles with a rubric that encompasses eggs 
and livers as well. This particular location lies close to the 
CBS studios and has become an unofficial commissary to 
the network. As a result, star-gazing is a common occur-
rence here where you can see them order chicken smoth-
ered in gravy and onions which! of courSe, is served with . 
waffles and biscuits. This restaurant is not for the calorie 
CONCious with its homemade cornbread, sweet potato 
pie, and potato salad. Wash it down with a beer and share 
a conversation with your date on the most unusual places 
you've ever ate at. Prices range from S4-511, keeping that 
smile on your checkbook.

JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Associate Copy Editor 

For the last few years, music 
critics have had a field day pro-
nouncing the death of music in its 
variou$ forms. The sentiment 

• seems to be that music has gone 
to the wolves - the charts are 
held inescapably captive by the 
likes of Limp Bizkit and Britney 
Spears, and there's nothing you 
or I can do about it. 

I am not ashamed to admit 
that I can endure listening to 
Spears, 98 Degrees or B-Witched. 
I don't-rush to condemn groups 
of that sort, but I wouldn't buy 
their albums, either. (I try to con-
vince myself that the 98 Degrees 
Christmas album in my collection 
doesn't count, because it was a 
gift.) 

In spite of thete feelings, I do 
have a problem with the fact that 
the Backstreet Boys and their 
cohorts crowd the American 
charts and radio stations with 
their tracks. Their larger than life 
presence (forgive the pun) seems 
to prevent many other excellent 
artists from holding so much as 
the last place on the BiUboard Hot 
100 singles chart, let alone getting 
any air time. 

To gain some relief from the 
tiresome trends of American 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 15 

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Seeking refuge from contemporary pop in the Brit-rock scene 
kitsch-pop, ( found that ( had to 
look beyond the Mickey Mouse 
Club graduates, white-boy rap 
and slick prankster punk. Over 
time, I discovered that music is 
not dead - indeed, it is alive 
and kicking - but if you want to 
get beyond the fluff, you need to 
use your peripheral vision and 
look in places you never thought 
to examine before, even if it 
means looking to another coun-
try. 

1 first went searching for my 
musical niche as an impression-
able eighth grader, flipping 
around the Bay Area radio dial 
from Live 105 to Wild 107. 1 
became immediately aware of 

than 40 years, British artists 
have been at the cutting edge of 
musical moveinents that have 
affected the American music 
scene as much as anywhere. 
Britain has spawned musical 
vanguards from the 19605 to the 
present, ranging from the Beat-
les to dance $roup mavericks 
like Basement Jaxx. 

The Jaxx, for example, take 
house music out of its tired cas-
ing and reinvent the art of dex-
terous sampling. You won't find 
this group credited in the album 
sleeve of any cheesy Z90 
Enrique Iglesias synth-pop 
remixes. It's not just in the dubs 
and warehouses of south Lon-

vocals reminiscent of the blues of 
the mid-20th century. (Apparent-
ly, American college students 
aren't the only ones who party in 
TJ and end up doing things they 
later question and regret.) 

And, contrary to what Ameri-
can audiences may have expect-
ed, there is more to the Verve than 
1998's string-laden anthem "Bit-
tersweet Symphony." The band's 
1997 release, Urban Hymns, 
encompasses a variety of styles, 
ranging from the soaring to the 
pensive, all of which play upon 
the ear like a lush, relaxing musi-
cal stream. On many occasions, 
the American music industry is 
exposed to British music either 

To gR-in some relief from the tiresome trends of AmericR-n kitsch-pop) I found 
thR-t I had to look beyond the Mickey Mouse Club graduR-tes) beyond white-boy 
rap R-nd slick prankster punk. 

my developing propensity 
toward artists from Britain. I 
thirsted after what little ( could 
get of the likes of Blur, Oasis, 
Radiohead and Pulp. They all 
held an ineffable quality that 
other groups could never quite 
match lor me. 

I realized that ( had found my 
heaven among the British rock 
scene. This fact has often made 
me the subject of much derision 
and caused the perception that I 

__ am a zealous Brit-rock junkie of 
the worst sort. In some ways, I 
suppose that estimation is not too 
far from the mark, but it is not 
without its reasons. 

British music is a phenome-
non unlike any other. For more 

don, however, that British artists 
shine. 

While some complain that 
rock has lost its connections to 
its roots, like the bluesy guitar 
that hallmarks a distinctly 
American kind of rock, it is iron-
ic that many British groups carry 
the torch where U.S. artists have 
abandoned it in favor of other 
styles. 

Groups like the Verve and 
Gomez let the American influ-
ence show through on their 
songs, some of which might 
sound almost more at home on a 
country music compilation. 
Gomez's "njuana Lady" is an 
infusion of south-of-the-border 
guitar and gruff, melancholy 

belatedly or covertly. 
For example, Robbie Williams 

has been riding th."vave& of solo 
success both in the UK and the 
United States after his tenure 
with Brit boy band Take That 
(imagine a Backstreet Boy going 
solo but actually putting out 
quality music). However, that 
song' Angels" that you and your 
roommates sing along with in the 
car is far from new. It was 
released nearly three years ago in 
the UK and was repackaged for a 
U.s. audience only recently. 

Similarly, hip-hop artist Moni-
ca's "Angel of Mine" is actually a 
song penned by British R &: B 
group Eternal, also approaching 
its third birthday. I can vouch for 

the fact that the original mix 
should never have been remade 
into a hip-hop song - American 
audiences are missing out on a 
beautiful ballad with the absence 
of Eternal's version. 

1 don't mean to assume that 
all the cutting-edge develop-
ments occurring in music right 
now are happening on a tiny 
island in the North Atlantic. That 
would be a foolish and short-
sighted judgment. There are cer-
tainly aspects of the U.S. music 
scene that deserve credit for 
innovation as well, though my 
personal experience has been 
that it takes a little more digging 
to find palatable material on this 
side of the ocean. 

Some of my friends continue 
to mock me for my diurnal visits 
to www.dotmusic.com and for the 
hundreds of dollars I've spent 
on import singles and CDs. But 
it remains true for me that listen-
ing to just one song by Pulp, 
Oasis, Shed Seven or Catatonia 
makes it all worth it. Until ( hear 
domestic groups conSistently 
producing the same variety of 
eclectic quality. I won't be con-
vinced that I m on the wrong 
path. 

The point is this: Don' t be sat-
isfied with mediocrity. It is easy 
to complain about how Jessica 
Simpson, Christina Aguilera and 
Sugar Ray have stormed the 
charts and the airwaves. Howev-
er, music as we know it is far from 
being a lost cause. It may be nec-
essary to dig deeper to find the 
groups that make music worth 
listening to again, but they are 
out there, whether on this shore 
or another.

Trading the pressures of school for games 
On-campus video game club offers an escape for st~dents looking to have a good time 
By ALEX LEE 
Contributing Staff Writer 

As one of the newest clubs on 
campus, Sore Losers Video 
Game Club hopes to break the 
stereotype of the anti-social 
video game guru. 

Created last year, the club 
aims to provide the video gam-
ing community at UCSD with a 
fun, relaxed environment while 
focusing on the social and com-
petitive aspects of the popular 
pastime. 

According to the club's presi-
dent, Steven Shao, over half of 
UCSD students have access to 
video games, either in the form of 
a dedicated gaming system or 
computer. 

"[Video games arel great stress 
relievers for college," Shao said. 
"Espec.ially with new systems like 
Sega Dreamcast and Sony 
Playstation, their popularity is 
growing all the time." 

The club has full financial 
backing from ASUCSD. The 
club's officials attest that almost 
all of its funding goes toward 
organizing events. 

"Since all of the systems -are 
ours, not to mention the hun-
dreds of games we have in our 

collection, all the money we get 
basically goes in running events 
that we have at UCSD," said 
Nick Chow, one of the club's 
founders.

dents of UCSD our priority," Shao 
said. "That's why we have the5e 
events where we give away 
prizes for free. Students always 
ask if there's a catch, but I ten 
them there isn't. Anybody who

has hosted such events as Video 
Game Expo, AnimeFesl and 
most recently, the Sega Mobile 
Assault Tour that was on display 
during the vendor's fair. 

Students may recall the large 
video game displays along 
Library Walk that showcased the 
new Sega Dreamcast earlier this 
quarter. Sega of America and 
IGN.com co-hosted the event, 
providing their multi-million 
dollar gaming machines, fully 
equipped with four televisions 
and matching game consoles. 
Students competed, free of 
charge, for various prizes. The 
grand prize was a new Sega 
Dreamcast video game system. 

"We want to make the stu-

likes video games is welcome to 
our meetings and events, even 
those who don't. We don't even 
charge dues and everybody can 
play for free." 

Informal meetings are held 
every Thursday night at 7:30 
p.m. in the Price Center Game 
Room. Attendees can usually 
expect to compete against one 
another on one of the many sys-
tems hooked up to big screen 
televisions. The club provides 
free' gaming experience to any-
one interested. Students can also 
contact Sore Losers Video Game 
Club at office 210 in the Old Stu-
dent Center. 

Sore Losers Video Game Club 
holds a number of honors. At Sun 

God Festival '99, the club WOll the 
"Best Booth Award." In addition. 
Shao placed second at the eemi-
finals of a recent Sega National 
Tournament. His performance 
took him to national finals in Las 
Vegas, where the grand prize was 
SI5,OOO. 

"We wanted to represent 
UCSD," Shao said. "That's wh)' 
the entire club went to Vegas and 
not just me." 

Coming events' of the Sore 
Losers Video Game Club will 
include a second AnimeFest, 
which is scheduled for Sunday, 
April 16 at the Price Center. The 
dub will work in association with 
Cal-Animage Beta on this event 
in order to showcase the latest 
Japanese animation. In addition, Shao hopes to host 
a competition sponsored by such 
corporations as CompUSA, Intel 
and Sega at the next AnimeFest. 
The competition will feature the 
latest system, Playstation 2. Addi-
tionally, a $2,000 prize will be 
awarded to the best player of two 
games, NBA 2K and Unreal Tour-
nament. 

Shao hopes for the dub's con-
tinued growth, and aims to keep 
it a "UCSD thing." where the stu-
dents are the top priority. 

College couples stay true to form 
Your Valentine s Day activity will be directly related to the type of relationship you are in 
~ BETH MHOE 

St8ff~ter 

Individual Valentine's - Day 
experiences can range from.bUss-
ful to hellish. Look around UCSD 
and you see all types of couples, 
indulging their personal heart-
shaped libidos on what is sup-
posed to be the most romantic 
holiday of the year. 

My current research on the 
variety of romantic couples at 
UCSD is still a work in progress; 
however, I can provide recom-
mendations for the most love-
inducing Valentine activities.

No one in their right mind would 
ever think you were on a Valen-
tine's date at Porter's Pub, because 
most normal p!Ople don't go there 
for VhntinP"s Thly. To make the 
affair seem casual, just order hot 
bites (jalapeno poppers) and a 
beer. No one will ever suspect that 
the sweet nothings you whisper to 
one another are anything more 
than quantum physics equations.

Unfortunately, becaule Mon-

Do you wash the number off of 
your hand, and pretend like n0th-
ing ever happened? Or do you 
violate the Swingers rule and call 
on Sunday, a lull three days 
ahead of schedule? You'll find the 
answer is directly proportional to 
how drunk you were. 
..... UCID' ...... C ..... : 

The UCSD/~I couple is the 

easiest type to spot becauee they 
are always seen either coming 
from or going to the library. In fad. 
you could probably lee them in 
Geise\ on Va'lentine's Day. Youtniy 
even hear them reminiscing aboUt 
last Valentine's Day, when they 
had a very exciting time becaUle 
they studied at a di1ferent table. 

My advice to this coup.: Go 10 
the Night Owl, a bar in PICiIk 
Beach, to celebrate Va1entine'1 Dar this year. The Night Owl 
Cocktail Lounge is open hum 
6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. A1theuah 
the Night Owl is best known lOr 
its early hours, my friend swem 
that the Night Owl is the eooIeIt 
place to go after alate-niSht 8ludy 
session. However, if you are w0r-
ried about missing prime-tlme 
Geisel hours, you could alw.ys 
go before your classes. 

To be perfectly honest, if Saint 
Valentine has blessed ' you thIa 
year (or at the very least doeIn't 
seem have it in for you) then you 
will not engage in any of the ~ 
viously mentioned activities. I 
can tell you from personal experi' 
ence (see scandalous couple) that 
Valentine's is all abont wbat you 
make of it (or make-out of It).

POLO: 
Tritons win on final 
day of tournament 
c ............. .. 
agaiNt UC Santa Barbara, but 
nonethele8s fell 11-8 agaiNt their 
eleventh-ranked opponent. 

More Tritons got into the 
action on the offensive end with 
Kudritzki once again leading 
with three goab. Also, 
Hemmerly threw down two, and 
Samara Silverman, Angie 
Kondrat and Danielle Boyle each 
added to the scoring attack. 
UCSD goalie Maryam Hadiashar 
had an impressive afternoon 
defending the cage with 10 
saves. 

UCSD stood strong with Santa 
Barbara.in the first game by match-
ing its three scores, and pulled 
ahead to an 8-5 lead at half time. 

"When we moved, we created 
opportunities down low and that 
was a plus for us," Senders said. 
As a result of their mobility, the 
Tritons were able to get ejections, 
which benefited their scoring 
attack. 

However, UCSD could not 
muster a single point in the second 
half while Santa Balbara pulled 
away with five and the victory. 

'['he Tritons then lost to the 
University of Hawaii Wahine 8-5. 

After a dose first quarter, the 
Wahine captured the lead in the 
second. The team scored three 
K081s in three minutes to finish 
the quarter up 6-2. The Tritons 
scored two quick goals in the 
third to dose the gap to 6-4. 
However, the Wahine answered 
with two more to firmly put the 
team up 8-4. 

Lalt weekend, the Tritons 
returned home to Canyonvi!w 
for the UCSD Arena NoGrip 
Invitational. 

UCSO played San Jose State. 

first 011 Friday, Feb. 11. 
"Our lint four games were 

tough for us," Sanders said. and 
this game proved to be no excep-
tion. The 'IWtlW played head to 
head agamat San Jose State, but 
due to lOme mental mistakes, 
they were ed8ed out 10-9. 

The Tritons alIO faced UCLA 
on Friday, who had just come off 
beatin8 No.1 USC. UCLA beat 
the Tritonl for the aecond time 
this year in almost the same fash-
ion as in Hawaii's tournament, 
16-3. 

Against No. 2 Stanford on 
Satuniay, the Tritons gave the 
Cardinal tough first and second 
quarters but carne up on the 1os-
ing end of the stick. 

"We failed to c~pitalize on 
some scoring opportunities down 
low," Sanders said. 

The &arne inability to execute 
befell the liitons in their next 
game against UC Santa Balbara, 
in whicl\ they got a lot of ejections 
but didn't take advantage of 
thoee opportunities. 

yesterday, the Tritons' overall 
game seemed to gel agaiNt San 
Oiego State. Playing for the ninth 
and 10th spots in the tournament, 
both teams battled with UCSD 
prevailing 9-7. The Tritons did 
well in man-to-man coverage 
during all four periods, main-
tained a 1-2 plead the whole 
game and threw the ball into the 
cage for points when they saw 
chances. 

"It's a matter of old players 
adjusting 10 the new roach and all 
of us getting used to playing with 
each other. We've only played 
with each other for about a week, 
but) expect us to be ready to chal-
-Ienge people very soon." Sander 
said iri reference to the future of 
this season. 

For President's Day weekend, 
UCSD will visit UC Santa Cruz to 
play the Banana Slugs on 
Saturday.

Tritons Top Chapman, Again 
HOOPS: Excellent foul shooting and a late run make for a big win 

AuocIete Sports Editor 

With the ' UCSD women's 
basketball team facing the p0s-
Sibility of qualifying for an 
excellent playoff spot, the 
Tritons did battle with such 
optimism in mind as they took 
the court against 
Chapman University 

next game against The Master's 
College next Saturday nidlt at 
RIMAe. With their recora, they 
should have no problem, at the 
very least, making the postsea-
son. 

The Tritons started Friday 
niJdlt's game cold as they had 
di'fficulty sinking their shots. 
The score was 17-8 Chapman in 

last Friday 
Feb. 11th 
on the 
road. It 

the "rst half, and UCSD 
showed no signal that· they 

were ready for ~;-::;;!~.r;;-r7"T'1 offensive pro-
would seem from 
seeing the ecore, 72-
49, that the Tritons easily 
took apart their o~nents but 
as Head Coach Judy Malone 
will tell you, lookS can be 
deceiving. The Tritons actually 
were in a dose game until five 
minutes were remaining in the 
fourth quarter. The Tritons car-
ried a ten point lead into the 
final quarter with about 5:20 to 
go, when they went on their 
tearing run over Chapman. 

duction. UCSD 
then started to pass the ball 

more and work together bet-
ter as a team. They went up by 

eight points later in the half. 
Head Coach Judy Malone then 
made a series of substitutions to 
give her starters soll1e rest. 
Chapman seized this opportuni-
ty to score some points and cut 
the Triton lead to just two points, 
28-26. 

In third quarter, the Tritons 
built their lead back up to 10. 
The game's score fluctuated for a 
large part of the second half until 
UCSD decided t. on a scoring 

Ruvald had 10 points and 10 
rebounds. Kimberly Neal also 
came up with 10 points on four 
rebounds. Kate Turnbull added 
12 and collected six rebounds. 
Nicholle Bromley led the way 
for UCSD with 15 and grabbed 
six off the glass. 

UCSD's dominance of 
Chapman can also be attributed 
to making the shots they needed 
to at the charity stripe. Their foul 
shooting at the free-throw line 
was an impressive 20 for 26. 

"Despite what the score says, 
the game actually came down to 
composure. They had very good 
defense, which was a nice chal-
lenge for us to face. They knew 
our plays, and we knew theirs. It 
was a good battle," Malone said . 

The Tritons next face The 
Master 's College this Saturday 
night. 

"It will be a good game to end 
on, they're a solid NAIl team," 
Malone said. 

Partly motivating the noble 
effort which Chapman brought 
forth last Friday was the fact tNt 
with a win, they would've 
secured a playoff spot before the 
Tritons could. With overall sea-
son records similar, UCSD 18-5 
and Chapman 16-5, Friday night 
was a fight for postseason rank-
ing. The Tritons won't know 
their playoff fate until after their 

barrage. . 
UCSD showed the best ball 

movement of the entire game late 
in the fourth and ran away with 
the game leaving Chapman puz-
zled over what had just hit them. 

The last time the Tritons 
faced The Master's College they 
won by ten, and Judy Malone 
expects round two to be a hard-
fought contest. This will be the 
final regular season game for 
UCSD. 

Scoring-wise, UCSD had a 
nice distribution with four play-
ers in double digits. ~\1ieve 

The game starts at 6 p.m. and 
it will feature the final game for 
the seniors on the basketball 
team. Come out to RIMAC to 
cheer on the seniors and the rest 
of the Tritons.

Brian Well •• 
Beating the spread 
outside of Nevada 

If I won a large sum of 
someone's money in a bet on 
the Super Bowl, woulci you 
denou~ce my behavior? If you 
were someone with a fun-lov-
ing lersonality who didn't 
min losing to a good friend 
once in a while, I don't think 
you would - but your reac-
tion would be different if you 
were an NCAA official or 
maybe a relative of Bob Dole's. 

America's tight-wad atti-
tude toward gambling is out 
of hand, especially in its effect 
on sporting event bets. 
Hearing about the misfortune 
of Erik Barkley, a point guard 
for St. John's, brought this 
issue to my attention the other 
day. 

I was sitting on my couch 
being a good guy by doing 
my boring reading assign-
ments when I heard about his 
suspension on TV. (Well, I 
guess I wasn't completely in 
student mode.) I think it is 
quite sad that he's been 
benched by the NCAA for 
several games after a viola-
tion for the swapping of a car 
with a long-time family 
friend . His team is now in 
jeopardy of getting screwed 
in the NCAA tournament 
because of his absence. 

Now, I've heard of handi-
capped parking permit fias-
coes and of guys missing prac-
tice and getting suspended, 
but I think the reprimands go a 
little too far when having fun 
with friends leads to punish-
ment. 

It also bothers me when 
coUegiate players get offered 
money and then get busted for 
accepting it. If one of the mem-
bers of these miserable NCAA 
panels responsible for making 
life difficult for these athletes 
was offered any sort of bonus, 
he or she would take it no 
questions asked. 

I remember when Chiefs 
linebacker Donnie Edwards, 
who was at UCLA back in the 
day, opened the door to his 
shanty college apartment to 
find groceries on his porch. 
Like any smart human being 
needing to conserve money 
while in college, he took the 
food with a clear conscience. 
The NCAA, however, didn't 
recognize the triviality of his 
case and served up a suspen-
sion for Edwards. From the 
team nutritionist's perspec-
tive, it's too bad that the calo-
ries from the extra food went 
to waste while he wafched 
UCLA play on TV - he could 
have used those calories on the 
field. 

Please forgive me; I usually 
like to pinEint my concerns, 
but now I m getting off sub-
ject. This is all somehow relat-
ed to gambling in sports. 
• Now, I agree that wagering 
tons of money on any game is 
outside the bounds of reason-
able mandates imposed by the 
NCAA on its players and 
coaches. When I say reason-
able, I'm referring to cases

Men Struggle With D~I Teams 
DIGGING: After competing well against La Verne and UCSC, the Tritons run into trouble 
By BRIAN WB.LES 
Associate Sports Editor 

strong in the first game, as the 
team was able to put points on 
the board. The Tritons were pass-
ing well and hanging tough 
against their Division I opponent. 

Assistant Coach Kevin 
Ring said he was still pleased 
with his team's performance in 

It was a harsh reality for the 
UCSD men's volleyball team to 
face Division I titans after playing 
well against opponents in its own 
division. game two despite the fact 

.......... that the Tritons posted The last two matches for UCSD against 
UCLA and 
Stanford have 
confirmed the 
frustration 
brought on by this difficult 
obstacle. 

After matching up nicely and 
easily beating the University of 
La Verne and UC Santa Cruz, the 
Tritons encountered a little more 
muscle from the opposing side of 
the net in the form of the Bruins 
and the Cardinal. 

On Friday, the Tritons traveled 
to the John Wooden Center to face 
second-ranked UCLA. Their trip 
north provided more entertain-
ment to their opponent's home 
crowd of 634 than it did for the 
Triton squad; UCSD was soundly 
defeated 15-12, 15-1, 15-0 in 80 
minutes. 

UCLA dominated the match 
by out-hitting the Tritons .534 to 
.193, as well as out-blocking them 
10 to 2.5. Senior Evan Thatc:per 
led the Bruins with 15 ·kills and 
eight digs, followed by freshman 
Scott Morrow's 14 kills and three 
blocks. Junior Mark Williams 
added 11 kills and four blocks. 
Freshman setter Rich Nelson 
recorded 51 assists in his third 
career start. 

Donald Chen led the Tritons 
with 17 kills and 10 digs, fol-
lowed by lack Hite's 12 kills. 
Against the Bruins, UCSD resem-
bled a busted pipe slowly leaking 
steam; its side-out game was 

only one point. In the 
third game, 
UCSD could not 
grapple effec-

tively with the 
heavy competition any 

longer. 
"We got flat In the third 

game," Ring said. "We did not 
compete hard at all." 

UCSD trekked back to RlMAC 
on Saturday and was completely 
shut down once more - this time 
by the Stanford Cardinal 15-11, 
15-7, 15-2. The tempo of the 
Tritons' performance was analo-
gous to the UCLA match in that 
they started off playing wen with 
a better team, but then faltered 
more and more as the game pro-
gressed. 

Coming into the match, 
tJCSD's game plan was to set the 
middles, freeing up the outside 
blockers to score points. That 
strategy helped it to victories 
over La Verne and Santa Cruz, 
and although Stanford's players 
are smaller over"U than UCSD's 
prior Division I opponents, the 
TrItons couldn't get the score-
board ball rolling. 

"They used a different line-up 
than w~ expected, but we 
should've been able to handle 
the guys that were in there," 
Ring said. 

UCSD also intended to come 
out on Saturday with a strong
