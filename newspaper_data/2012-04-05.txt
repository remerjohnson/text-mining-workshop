Comedian Conan O’Brien — of TBS’s “Conan” and “Saturday Night Live” fame — will host 
a talk as part of Sixth College’s tenth 
anniversary event, Sixth College 
Student Life Officer Elaine Scott con-
firmed Monday in an email. The April 
20 event, held at RIMAC Arena, will 
also include a question-and-answer 
session with the TV star. According 
to Sixth College’s website, ticket dates 
will be announced next Monday, 
April 9.  

Sixth College’s Tenth Anniversary 

Committee, composed of seven staff 
members and two Sixth College stu-
dents, started planning the celebra-
tion event during Fall Quarter and 
collectively decided on O’Brien to 
headline the talk. 

“[The committee] wanted a speak-
er,” Scott said. “So we put feelers out to 
people, submitted a request to Conan, 
got a date and decided to go with 
him.”

Former British Prime Minister 
Gordon Brown spoke at UCSD as 
part of an annual lecture series pre-
sented by the UCSD Center of Global 
Justice, the Helen Edison Lecture 
Series and the Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies. Brown conducted a free 
lecture at the Estancia Hotel and 
Spa about “Meeting Millennium 
Development Goals” on Tuesday, 
April 3. Around 450 people attend-

ed the lecture, which hit maximum 
capacity.

Brown focused his lecture on glob-
al education. After serving as Prime 
Minister and the head of the Labour 
Party in the United Kingdom from 
2007-10, Brown co-led the Global 
Campaign for Education’s High Level 
Panel in 2011. The panel is part of the 
Global Campaign for Education, an 
organization that’s aided in funding 
more than 40 million educations in 
developing countries such as South 
Sudan, and has promised to make 
governments accountable to their 
education pledges.

“If you educate a child, it’s the best 
anti-crime, the best anti-deprivation, 
the best anti-delinquency policy,” 
Brown said. “If you educate a child,

    A California judge has struck down 
the UC Davis Police Union’s attempt to 
block the release of a report on the UC 
Davis pepper spray incident. Union 
members tried to block the report — 
which documented the findings of a 
UC-appointed task force — because 
they feared that the report, which like-
ly named individual officers, would 
compromise the privacy of the officers 
in question. 

In his March 28 ruling, California 
Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo 
wrote that the report should conceal 
the names of all but two of the officers 
involved. Grillo’s ruling is in com-
pliance with California Penal Code 
sections 832.7 and 827.8, which pro-
hibit general release of private records 
of police activity. UCD Police Chief 
Annette Spicuzza and Lt. John Pike — 
who became notorious last year when 
videos of him deliberately spraying 
Davis Occupy protesters went viral — 
will both be named. 

In his ruling, Grillo said that nei-
ther the state government nor the 
California Supreme Court provides 
any provisions allowing for significant 
restrictions on the public release of 
reports about law enforcement offi-
cers. 

He also said that there is no legisla-
tion preventing “public entities from 
disclosing the results of those investi-
gations if they touched on the conduct 
of individual police officers.” 

The report is the findings of a 
task force led by former California 
Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso. 
UC President Mark G. Yudof commis-
sioned the task force last November 
with the job of investigating the now-
infamous UC Davis pepper spray inci-
dent and providing insight on how 
to approach similar scenarios in the 
future.  

While Grillo ruled that no legal 
codes prevented the report from being 
released with names withheld, UC 
General Counsel Charles Robinson 
released a statement on March 29 
announcing that the task force would 
postpone the release even further as 
to allow the police union a chance to 
appeal the decision. 

The task force will postpone the 
release past the first week in April to 
allow 21 days for an appeal to be filed. 
The earliest date the report can be 
released is April 23.

Team May Have Found Long-Lost da Vinci Painting in Italy
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

ILLUSTRATION BY SNIGHDHA PAUL/GUARDIAN

BY MICHAEL CHANG
Staff Writer

A UCSD-led team is close to verifying the location of the lost Leonardo da Vinci 
art piece “Battle of Anghiari.”  
    The search is being spearheaded 
by UCSD engineering professor and 
lead researcher Maurizio Seracini 
(who is also a 1973 UCSD alum) 
and project manager Alexandra 
Hubenko. 

Data from the team’s analysis 
in late 2011 suggests that the piece 
is located behind Giorgio Vasari’s 
mural “The Battle of Marciano” in 
the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, 
Italy.

In 1503, da Vinci was com-
missioned to paint “The Battle of 
Anghiari” in the Hall of 500 of the 
Palazzo Vecchio. “Battle” is believed 
to be his largest painting. 

Then, in the mid-16th century, 
Giorgio Vasari enlarged and remod-
eled the hall, possibly hiding the 
painting behind one of six new 
murals on the walls.

“We’re trying to find out is if it’s 
there,” Hubenko said. “The research 
that we did late last year basically 
proved that we are looking in the 
right place, but we still have more 
research to do to definitively say 
‘Yes, it’s there’ or ‘No, it’s not there’ 
and to be able to identify the state of 
its conservation.”

Seracini’s interest in the lost 
painting started in the 1970s. 

Since then, he has been pursuing 
it periodically based on access to 
funding and access to the building 
itself. 

There is a large body of back-
ground research spanning multi-
ple disciplines about the Palazzo 
Vecchio. 

These studies include a high-
resolution three-dimensional laser 
scan of the Hall of 500 and geo-
radar scanning of the walls. 

The latter identifies the air gap 
where the team eventually per-
formed its analysis.

The Palazzo Vecchio is both a 
government building, which houses 
the mayor of Florence’s office, and a 

museum that hosts many art pieces. 
Due to its dual nature and the 

rate at which government power 
exchanges hands, it was difficult to 
obtain permission. The team need-
ed the approval of both the govern-
ment and museum directorates.

“The Italian government tends to 
change pretty frequently,” Hubenko 
said. “So if we had gotten all of our 
permission and then the adminis-
tration changed, it might be neces-
sary for us to reapply for everything 
from the top.”

The team exercised extreme cau-
tion because of the delicate nature of 
the paintings. 

The team worked closely with 
art restorers, who removed parts 
ready for restoration and allowed 
the researchers to drill in those par-
ticular areas d. 

The original plan was to use 
non-invasive procedures. 

In the end, the team selected 
to use an endoscopy; this requires 
sticking a very thin tube (with a 
camera attached to the end of it)

you are breaking a cycle of poverty 
for the future.”

Specifically, Brown addressed 
Millennium Development Goals 
formed by world leaders at the 2000 
UN Millennium Summit. Several 
of the goals, including reducing the 
infant mortality rate and women’s 
childbirth mortality rate, are likely 
to fail by the goal’s 2015 deadline, 
Brown said. 

“We can meet one goal, the edu-
cation goal,” Brown said. “We have 
managed over the last few years to 
get millions of children to school, 
but today there are 67 billion chil-

dren who are not going to school. 
In the year 2012, it is wholly unac-
ceptable for a young child in Africa 
or Asia to be denied that chance for 
education.” 

Two of the eight Millennium 
Development Goals focus on global 
education. 

These goals aim to ensure that all 
children complete primary school-
ing by 2015, eliminate gender dis-
parities in primary education by 
2005 and eliminate gender dispari-
ties at all educational levels by 2015. 

The Helen Edison Lecture Series 
offers free public lectures about 
humanitarian issues and has hosted 

the likes of Al Gore, Mohammad 
Yunus and Toni Morrison. 

Helen Edison funded the lecture 
series with a generous endowment. 
Edison died in 1990.

“This is a donation and request 
after [Helen Edison] died, we got 
the money to fund free public lec-
tures to stimulate public discourse 
and to discuss important topics,” 
media coordinator Henry DeVries 
said. “Students can attend at no 
charge, and they are aimed at both 
students and the public.”

Council seemed disappointed that Guardian veteran Natalie Covate had forfeited 
her role as A.S. Columnist and 
laughed a little when 
I asked them to go 
easy on me. They 
laughed even harder 
when I not-really-
jokingly said that I 
was hoping to find 
someone else to write 
this column.

Natalie’s departure seemed fitting, 
as change was a running theme for 
last night’s meeting.  Council began 
its first meeting of Spring Quarter 
with a quick election to replace AVP 
Diversity Affairs Jesus Romero 
as speaker. Romero emailed his 
resignation as speaker on Monday 
and President Alyssa Wing, who 
was filling in temporarily, was 
quick to solicit nominations for a 
replacement.The two nominated 
candidates, Advocate General 
Courtney Hill and VP Student Life 
Meredith Madnick each made brief 
speeches, before council elected Hill 
as the new Speaker.

During the logistical planning 
of the impromptu election, VP 
Finance & Resources Kevin Hoang 
wondered aloud if the Speaker 
job conflicted with the Advocate 
General job.

“We need Mac back, he could 
decide this for us,” Campuswide 
Senator Matthew Bradbury said, 
referring to former AVP Academic 
Affairs Mac Zilber, who graduated 
last quarter. Bradbury’s comment 
was met with a chorus of “awwww” 
from council, who decided that Hill 
was eligible to be speaker.

Once Hill assumed the mic, 
Romero announced a new campus-
wide poster campaign about ending 

stereotypes called ‘We’re Individuals.’ 
He asked that members of council 
email him stereotypes that they 
would like to see included on the 

poster.
AVP College 

Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt tried 
recruiting 
councilmembers 
to attend a 
dodgeball game 
in the RIMAC 

Rec Gym between A.S. Council and 
various college councils on Saturday 
night. Unfortunately, not everyone 
will have a chance to throw balls at 
councilmembers personally, so we 
hope our own college councils can 
represent us well.

Wing said that she hoped that 
council would be active and take 
an official stance on California 
Assembly Speaker John Perez’s 
proposed middle class scholarships 
for public universities. 

AVP Enterprise Operations 
Brian McEuen announced that 
Triton Outfitters has started 
allowing student-run organizations 
to sell T-shirts through the A.S.-
run boutique. He also noted that 
the retail outlet for TO, currently 
in Price Center, will move to the 
Old Student Center near the Soft 
Reserves. It’s always nice to have 
new neighbors, and TO will soon 
be below our new offices. Maybe we 
can get some cool T-shirts too.

Before council went on a recess to 
attend a vigil and go to practice for 
UCSD Lipdub 2012, council cheered 
as Warren College Student Council 
RFAC Representative Samuel Chang 
was tapped to replace Zilber as 
interim AVP Academic Affairs. He 
has big shoes to fill, and hopefully 
he’s ready for the challenge.

into a wall to examine the space 
behind the wall. 

The team also utilized a scraping 
tool to gather samples for analysis.

The team’s next step is to verify 
the painting’s existence. 

“It’s not up to us to make deci-
sions about how to restore some-
thing or whether to take a wall 
down,” Hubenko said. “It’s our job 
as engineers and scientists to collect 

as much objective data as we can 
and help people like the restorers or 
the people in the cultural heritage 
field make decisions on how best to 
protect and preserve their cultural 
heritage.” 

The team is now waiting on Italian 
officials to convene and determine 
the next step for the project to take.

“We are waiting to hear from the 
Minister of Culture at the Italian 
parliament level and he is supposed 

to go to a meeting with the mayor in 
Florence and they’re supposed to dis-
cuss the project and decide what the 
next steps are in terms of proceed-
ing,” Hubenko said. “We’re kind of in 
a holding pattern right now.”

Seracini is currently in Florence, 
Italy and could not be contacted as of 
press time.

a first-come, first-serve basis. Tickets 
will be free. 

“His team has been very generous 
and Conan has been very generous 
with his time,” Scott said. “We want to 
pay him back with love.”

The committee sent O’Brien a 
care package filled with Sixth College 

T-shirts, sweatshirts and a video of 
reactions from students. Student 
committee members are also host-
ing a “Sixth Loves Conan” contest 
for Sixth College students to submit 
artwork, videos or other items as a 
“thank you” to O’Brien. The contest 
ends April 16. The winner will receive 
special seating at the event.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, APRIL 5,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

When the facts about Trayvon Martin’s death were first profiled by 
the media, a few things seemed 
clear. First, 17-year-old Martin, 
unarmed except for a can of iced tea 

and Skittles, was shot to death by 
28-year-old George Zimmerman, a 
self-appointed neighborhood watch 
captain in a Florida gated community. 
Oh, and there was the small but 
hugely significant fact that Trayvon 
was black and that Zimmerman, 
despite being half-Hispanic, was 
largely profiled as white and racist. 

Zimmerman has since claimed 
protection under the “Stand Your 
Ground” bill — which states that a 
person is allowed to use force when 
there is a reasonable belief of a threat 
— alleging that Martin attacked him 
and smashed his head into the ground 
before Zimmerman pulled the trigger. 
There are a number of incendiary 
words in this case: Aggressor. Victim. 
Racist. Unarmed. Suspicious persons. 

Because of this media firestorm, 
Martin’s tragic case became a cause 
célèbre, spurning calls for justice from 
talk show hosts to movie stars to a 
congressman who wore a hoodie in 
solidarity with Trayvon, who had 
donned a hooded sweatshirt that 
day. Even President Obama, who 
has already come under fire for 
“overstepping his boundaries” by 
commenting on racially charged cases, 
stated that if he had a son, he would 
look like Trayvon. 

All across the nation, calls to 
punish Zimmerman have rallied a 
large swath of the population behind 
the common goal of racial justice. 
Fueled by fury, fueled by horror, 
fueled by the stench of decades of 
continued racial injustice, America 
calls for Zimmerman’s blood.

But the trial hasn’t even started 
yet. A huge chunk of crucial evidence 
hasn’t been released to the public. But 
as every new piece of evidence relating 
to the case is revealed, it becomes 
obvious that the media, despite its best 
intentions, are distorting a case that 
grows bigger with every article.

Newspapers like the Orlando 
Sentinel have taken to hiring voice 
analysis experts to analyze a key 
piece of evidence — a 911 call made 
by a neighbor where a person could 
be heard screaming for help in the 
background. Further, ABC News 
published an enhanced version of a 
police video, shot after the night of 
the murder, of Zimmerman’s injuries. 
And obviously, there is the matter 
of published mug shots. Shortly 
after Martin’s death, the photos that 
depicted him showed a fresh faced 
young man, while Zimmerman’s 
corresponding photo depicted him as 
a large aggressor. 

Undoubtedly, the media eye 
surrounding this case has boosted 
the Justice for Trayvon cause, and has 
transformed, for better or for worse, 
the way the public will view the case. 
But if the public truly wants justice for 
Trayvon, distorting the case will only 
take us further from the truth.

Every Week One of Spring Quarter, the Guardian Editorial Board holes up in Hi Thai to interview A.S. Council hopefuls 
for our annual endorsement issue, which runs Monday of Week Two. This long-standing tradition gives us an opportunity to 
get to know the candidates running for office, and share the results with the campus at large. 

But while we schedule interviews religiously and debate qualifications for hours, we’re less adept at following up and 
evaluating the performance of those we thought would be good councilmembers, and those who actually turned out to be 
good councilmembers. So, since we spend 59 issues of the year covering council mistakes and writing critical editorials, we’re 
launching our first annual A.S. Honors feature to honor those who exceed expectations, and give a good name to our local 
bureaucracy. 

This piece is not representative of the Editorial Board and is solely written by myself, Angela Chen, news editor 2009-
10 and editor in chief 2010-12. It is unscientific, not as comprehensive as I would like and, of course, wildly biased — but 
if anyone has the credentials to write an A.S. feature, it’s this long-suffering Guardian hag. I’ve been covering A.S. Council 
for longer than any of this year’s presidential candidates have been on A.S. Council. This week marks my third round of 
endorsement interviews, next week will be my third year moderating the candidate debates and I look forward to having 2 
a.m. calls and emergency meetings with a fourth A.S. president. 

This piece is restricted to councilmembers who sat on this year’s council and who are not running in the current election. 
Members are gauged by their achievements, transparency and visibility. There are other deserving councilmembers whose 
projects haven’t received as much publicity (or who have refused to return my calls), but it’s these six I have chosen to 
spotlight, and these I have chosen to thank. 

Look for our elections issue on stands Monday, April 9, which is also the first day students can begin voting on 
TritonLink. Voting ends Friday, April 13, and results will be announced that night.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji has been the odd man out in 
this year’s populist, single-slate council. 
Last April, Naji was swept to victory as part 
of Board the Wing’s pro-Division I slate, 
and then unexpectedly became a dissenting 
voice against allowing the Division I 
referendum to pass to a student vote. He 
received the endorsement of pro-Israel 
groups after promising that he would vote 
“no” on the divestment resolution — and 
then the criticism of pro-Israel groups after 
sponsoring Student for Justice in Palestine’s 
divestment resolution. When it comes 

to sticking to slate politics, it’s clear that Naji has violated major campaign 
promises. When it comes to pure performance, Naji is the most impressive VP 
External in at least four years.  

In addition to being a key organizer in the reclamation of CLICS during 
Finals Week of Fall Quarter, Naji has been prominent at every student protest, 
including the March 1 Day of Action, whose turnout — while not comparable 
to 2010 numbers spurred by racial protests — was bounds ahead of last year’s 
no-show. He’s collaborated with the Public Education Coalition, participated 
in the occupation of the Chancellor’s Complex, helped spurred record UCSD 
turnout at lobby conferences and worked on informing students about issues 
in the Middle East. 

Having seen little from the rest of his office, and knowing little about the 
internal organization, this praise is for Naji’s conduct as an individual and an 
activist. That said, the Guardian Editorial Board didn’t endorse Naji last 
year — and in doing so, underestimated who has become of the most active 
members of A.S. Council.

Advocate General Courtney Hill 
has one of the most thankless jobs on 
council. As a combination attendance 
taker and elections manager, she has no 
vote, is required to stay neutral and is 
stuck enforcing the rules no one knows 
and everyone wants to protest. She’s 
received accusations of corruption, heard 
grievances over unsolicited emails and 
overeager flyering and fielded many calls 

from yours truly, always with a cool head, easy-to-work-with attitude and 
ready information.

While she’s made her share of slips — scheduling the CLICS survey 
schedule to be placed on the wrong ballot, and thus rendering it negligible 
— Hill oversaw the recent Division I election and led it to a record-breaking 
51-percent turnout. She facilitated informative forums, developed equally 
friendly relations with members from both campaigns, took the time to 
send corrections to Guardian articles and kept her own political leanings 
private. Hill is in charge of managing next week’s general elections and thus 
ineligible to run for office, but the sophomore has a chance at an appointed 
position, and lucky is the cabinet that has her sitting on it.

East Meets West

Say what you want about A.S. 
President Alyssa Wing’s views — 
and I have often disagreed with her 
stances — but this hyper-involved 
Warren College senior knows how 
to deliver. By sweeping last year’s 
elections by an overwhelming 
margin, Wing ensured that she 
would rule among supporters 
instead of being plagued by the 
divided government that hindered 
her predecessor, and the past two 
quarters have been one success after 
another.

She’s passed the budget in 
record time, begun the A.S. live 

blog and, most importantly, 
fulfilled an ambitious initiative that 
began nearly three years ago by 
bringing the Division I referendum 
to a student vote. Wing’s support 
for the $165-per-quarter Division-I 
referendum and public disapproval 
of the divestment resolution has 
made her unpopular with the more 
progressive students, and it’s easy to 
argue that her priorities don’t take 
into account the state of California 
higher education.

But Wing was clear about her 
priorities — ones largely shared 
by the sizable Greek and athletic 

communities — during last election 
season. She pitched her ideas, 
she won in a fair and democratic 
election and she made good on 
her promises to those who voted 
her in. I have repeatedly seen non-
A.S. members appraoch her and 
thank her for her work, a first for 
me, and A.S. members who have 
been on council for two years talk 
favorably of the differences between 
Wing’s lovey-dovey council and the 
previous one. At the end of the day, 
Wing is a first-rate politician who 
has remained true to her goal and 
done her job.

ALYSSA WING

A.S. PRESIDENT

I first came into 
contact with Mac Zilber 
— the 2011-12 Associate 
Vice President of 
Academic Affairs — two 
years ago. I had an 
obscure question about 
an email he sent to the 
A.S. listserv; today, I 
no longer remember 
the email, the question 
or the issue. Instead, I 
remember that he answered my inquiry, then immediately 
called me two times to clarify his comments and add more 
information. I was flabbergasted. A council member who 
knew what he was talking about? A council member who 
would talk to me of his own volition? Say it isn’t so. 

In the years since, Zilber has racked up accolades far 
more impressive than mine. He’s been publicly honored 
by former President Bill Clinton for his project dedicated 
to raising awareness of a $2,500 annual student tax credit. 
He’s been thanked by students for creating the Grade 
Distribution Tool, which has generated massive traffic for 
the A.S. website and provided conclusive evidence that yes, 
one must truly fail to get less than an A in Magagna’s poli 
sci classes. He’s worked to revise academic integrity laws, 
been involved in rewriting A.S. election bylaws, worked 
on issues of student privacy, helped to increase transfer 
representation on council and (perhaps most amazingly) 
created voter regression on A.S. elections for seemingly no 
reason other than personal interest. Zilber graduated at 
the end of Winter Quarter and has since relocated to Los 
Angeles, and council has lost one of its most pragmatic, 
effective members.

Imagine if the Flaming Lips headlined Sun God this year. Instead of some boozed, semi-famous hip-hop crew 
slurring through uninspired verses, we’d 
stand in awe of Wayne Coyne — the 
crazed and beautiful, silver-haired, LSD-
fried Lord of the Cool Dads — slowly 
emerging from a gigantic computer-
generated vagina in his signature giant 
hamster ball, just before the rest of the 
band rips into the triumphant orches-

tral stabs of “Race for the Prize.” On 
our way out, we’d swing by the merch 
table and pick up a copy of the band’s 
latest release: a tiny flash drive contain-
ing a three-song EP wedged into the 
translucent green center of a life-size, 
marijuana-flavored gummy skull.  Most 
importantly, it’d be some of the best 
songwriting, and likely the greatest 
performance, to grace the historic fes-
tival since whenever it was that Modest 
Mouse allegedly played (though such 
a phenomenon remains difficult to 
believe). 

For fans of one of modern music’s 
few classic bands, what could be more 
exciting and outrageously unexpected?

If you said, “A musical based on the 
Flaming Lips’ psych-rock opus Yoshimi 
Battles the Pink Robots that stars the 
members themselves and is directed by 
the guy who did Jersey Boys,” then it’s 
time to get very, very stoked. 

If you haven’t heard the news, the 
Lips’ ambitious theatrical project, 
which has been in the works with Tony 
Award-winning writer/director Des 
McAnuff since 2007, is being rehearsed 
and set for debut this November. And 
if that wasn’t extraordinary enough, 
the musical is opening in UCSD’s own 
backyard, the La Jolla Playhouse.

This is something to celebrate for a 
number of reasons, with the first being 
that it’s just a perfect fit for the band. 
The Flaming Lips have always been 
theatrical. The band’s live performances 
have gained a legendary renown for 
their technicolor spectacle of confetti, 
nudity, teletubbies and an array of 
bizarre props that contribute to the 
psychedelic on-stage narrative. And of 
course, there’s “Christmas on Mars,” 
the “Eraserhead”-meets-“2001” sci-fi 
feature film the band made in Coyne’s 
backyard along with Fred Armisen and 
Steve from “Blue’s Clues.” But with a 
seasoned musical theater veteran at the 
helm, the Lips have someone to keep 
“Yoshimi” from sinking into the kind 
of spazzy — albeit delightful — psy-
chosis that may not fully succeed on 
Broadway. Still, it will be interesting to 
gauge the reaction of the Playhouse’s 
dedicated congregation of rich and 
elderly patrons. 

On a more general level, the notion 
of the Flaming Lips taking a break from 
studio recording to jump into musi-
cal theatre seems to verify the band’s 
absurd genius. The Flaming Lips’ entire 
career has been a testament to the fact 
that serious music doesn’t have to be so 
serious — a concept taken for granted 
amongst the Radioheads and Arcade 
Fires of modern music’s exclusive 
high throne. They’re a hefty injection 
of whimsy and naive wackiness that 
music, theatrical or otherwise, needs 
right now. 

Is it what UCSD needs right now? 
That sort of goes without saying.

Beer and
 Loathing

In the spirit of such recent success stories as 
Mumford & Sons, Button Willow Locomotive 
has developed a polished brand of unobtrusive 
folk-rock bursting at the seams with cuteness 
and quirk. The duo, UC Irvine’s Alex Heflin and 
Amanda Carson, met in college and began mak-
ing music together in 2010. Now, they’re backed 
with a band (drummer Albert Law and bassist 
Kyle Gustafson), propelling the peppy shuffle of 
“The One With the Moon” and the Dire Straits-
esque barroom groove of “Don’t You Worry” to 
confident new heights on stage.

“We’re all originally from the Los Angeles 
County area but we’re currently boppin’ around all 
different parts of southern California,” the band 
told the Guardian in an email Wednesday. “What 
can you expect from our performance? Some 
bumbling awkwardness and Amanda’s attempts at 
wit, but mostly music from our hearts.”

Sun God
Battle of the Bands

Having already secured a dedicated following, 
and opening for notable acts such as Devin the 
Dude, the Cataracts, the Game, People Under the 
Stairs and the upcoming Freddie Gibbs show at the 
Loft this May 8, Alier Johnson is hardly a newcomer 
to San Diego’s hip-hop scene. And, with his refresh-
ing, revivalist approach to purely analog live rap, it’s 
little wonder how Alier and “the Band” (guitarist 
Andrew Ramos, drummer Kyle Venezuela and bass-

ist Nina Dumas) have turned so many heads. 
Johnson’s flow is fine-tuned and consistent with 

a lyrical approach more akin to the recent trend of 
everyman rap a la Curren$y and Kendrick Lamar’s 
Black Hippy crew, than to the gangsta rappers of 
decades past. With the solid soul/rock grooves of his 
skilled accompanying band behind him, the result 
is some infectious hip-hop that’d start Sun God off 
with a seriously smooth pre-party.

�e Guardian’s own Opinion 
Editor/up-and-coming songwriter 
Madeline Mann made the cut for this 
year’s Sun God Battle of the Bands, 
bringing her carefree blend of folk 
and pop to the Porter’s Pub stage 
this Friday night. Hailing from Santa 
Monica, Mann writes clever and sassy 
songs in the style of a stripped-down, 
bedroom pop version of Taylor Swi�.

Mann’s most notable track, “Hot 
Guys with Four Eyes” has appeared 
on more than two dozen geek and 
gamer websites — landing her a proud, 
self-proclaimed “geeky following” 
and over 7,000 views on YouTube. 
More recently, Mann won a Battle of 
the Bands at UCSD’s Home Plate and 
headlined at this year’s Los Angeles 
Mensa Convention. She is also set to 
perform at Revelle College’s music 
festival Revellution in May. 

Unlike the other bands competing this 
Friday, We Care has no official biography or 
flashy up-and-comer website. The only publicly 
available information about the three-piece 
UCSD band made up of Alan McCaffrey, 
Tyler Cranford and primary songwriter Kenny 
Katayama is on their Bandcamp page in the 
form of two streamable demos.

But the music kind of speaks for itself: brief 
and loud explosions of dirty, sweaty synth-punk. 

Songs like the fuzzed-out and funky “Cash” and 
the even heavier sex-thrash of “Flashing Lights” 
recalls a lo-fi, slightly more unhinged Death 
from Above 1979. When the band slows things 
down to place the focus on meditative harmo-
nies and bouncy grooves, they lose some of their 
edge, but the rest of their recorded material is 
some of the most inspired debauchery set to 
appear this Friday, straight from this year’s dark 
horse competitor. 

Taking cues from the slightly less obvi-
ous champions of psych-rock and shoegaze, 
the dubiously named Lucinda Matlock, are 
lead guitarist Matt Yantzer, bassist Michael 
Wied and brothers John and Luke Vickers 
(front man and drummer, respectively). On 
songs like the driving “Brittle” and trium-
phant, jangling “Walls” Lucinda Matlock 
aims for a pretty straightforward take on the 
starry, soaring 90s power-rock/pop of bands 
like the Smashing Pumpkins and Jimmy Eat 
World. 

“We have been playing together for 
about nine months now, and we’re really 
starting to gel together as a band and 
develop a sound we can all get behind,” 
John Vickers told the Guardian in an email 
Tuesday. Despite their relatively recent 
formation, Lucinda Matlock has some of 
the most confident and sleekly-produced 
recorded music of the six bands set to play 
this Friday. In terms of what’s to be expected 
of Lucinda Matlock’s set, Vickers seems as 
confident as the band’s radio-ready demos 
suggest: “You can expect us to get on stage 
and have one hell of a good time playing 
some rock ‘n’ roll!”

ALIER AND THE BAND

By Ren Ebel - Hiatus Editor

Cut from the same cloth as such southern 
rock-tinged radio headbangers as Kings of 
Leon, with an added dash of Foo Fighters 
and a singer who belts like Bloc Party’s Kele 
Okereke, the Lifted will provide the Battle of 
the Bands with the requisite lighter-in-hand 
power ballads of the night. Their formula 
isn’t the most original, but after finishing first 
place in student votes for the Battle of the 
Bands, the Lifted is probably more concerned 
with packing a couple hundred smiling, fist-
pumping ragers into a sweaty pub than they 
are with finding artistic solace. 

According to the Lifted’s bio, the band 

formed last year when UCSD roommates 
Jeff (bass/vocals) and Jacob (guitar/vocals) 
contacted drummer Ben and vocalist Jerome 
in the hopes of forming a band. Since then, 
the Lifted has played local shows at practi-
cally every UCSD venue, from the Che Cafe 
and Porter’s Pub, to Home Plate and Espresso 
Roma. 

“Expect a lot of rockin’ original material 
and a lively, passionate following of fans,” 
the band told the Guardian in an email 
Wednesday. “These are our two greatest 
assets. Mostly, we’d like to have a great time 
and prove once and for all that we are worthy

Adam Powers is included as an 
honorable mention solely because 
he no longer sits on council. Powers’ 
student involvement résumé is jaw-
dropping, and his repeated efforts to 
communicate with constituents, do 
outside research and avoid personal 
attacks even more so. He not only 
worked on the Transportation Policy Committee debating 
the future of our beloved blue-and-whites, but is plugged 
into transfer and commuter orgs, and has brought the 

perspective of these sometimes-ignored 
communities to light. 

Powers has contributed nuanced 
comments about everything from the 
transportation referendum to the recent 
Division I election, where he spoke out 
against students  on both campaigns each 
calling the other side corrupt and evil. 

Powers was the voice of reason when he had a vote, and

As an Sixth College 
Indian bioengineer who 
once ran for president, 
Parminder Sandhu is 
not the first of his kind 
to step through A.S. 
Council — ahem: 2006-07 
President Harry Khanna, 
2009-10 President Utsav 
Gupta — but he may 
be the one that has 
come closest to being a 
legend (at least now that 
everyone seems to have 
stopped obsessing over 
Khanna). In addition to 
being the man behind 
such ideas as “hot dog on a stick,” 
Sandhu has been refreshingly 
consistent in his views, outspoken 
about the issues he cares about 
and truly created a new level of 
“council visibility.”

As Advocate General his 
first year, Sandhu came to my 
attention for both his dedication 
to impeaching councilmembers 
who had too many absences, 
and his eternally quote-worthy 
remarks. In an environment where 
everyone is a coworker-friend, our 
elected officials often let emotions 
and personal alliances prevent 
them from keeping each other 
accountable. In contrast, Sandhu 
was unafraid to try to impeach 
anyone (even then-President-
elect Wafa Ben Hassine), and 
this respect for transparency has 
carried through in his career. 
Sandhu’s dedication to council is 

apparent, his massive amount of 
Facebook friends and A.S.-related 
statuses even more so — and thus 
he has probably been single-
handedly responsible for educating 
more people about the workings 
of our student government than 
the combined efforts of other 
members’ “visibility campaigns.” 

He became one of the few 
officers to return to a voting 
position after a failed election bid 
(Sandhu ran for president in 2011), 
and has weighed in on every issue 
that has passed through the fourth 
floor.

At times, Sandhu has been 
overly harsh and quick to judge 
— especially when dealing 
with Ben Hassine — but his 
presence over the past three years 
has lent a level of humor and 
communication rarely seen in 
student governments. There’s no 
one quite like Parminder.

ALBUM REVIEWS

It feels like ages since Chromatics 
released their last album, 2007’s 
Night Drive. Night Drive, along with 
records by Italians Do It Better 
labelmates Glass Candy and Desire, 
was a major part of that year’s 
Italo disco revival, which saw indie 
bands flirting with slow, arpeg-
giated basslines and nocturnal, often 
mournful female vocals.

Short lived as that movement 

was, Kill for Love’s opening track 
“Into the Black” is a total surprise: 
A Neil Young cover, it’s driven by 
distorted, almost sloppy electric 
guitar, a sound that would have 
seemed completely out of place 
on any of Night Drive’s sleek disco 
tracks. This newfound diversity is 
employed throughout Kill for Love. 
Though Chromatics’ signature 
palm-muted guitar and ambling 
beats are still present, they’re just 
as likely to indulge in buoyant AM 
radio piano lines or shuffling snare-
heavy drums.

A key aspect of Kill for Love is 
its scope. Its seventeen tracks last 
about an hour and a half, a con-
siderable length even for a double-
album. Chromatics’ songwriting is 
consistent though, and the album 
is generally free of filler. Songs like 
the standout “Lady,” or the melan-

choly “Candy” evoke the darker side 
of ‘70s radio rock, and are just as 
achingly beautiful as similar works 
by artists like Stevie Nicks or Steve 
Winwood, while tracks like “These 
Streets Will Never Look the Same” 
unfold with a cinematic sense of 
urgency, with patient, tense drum 
machines punctuating brittle syn-
thesizers.

Kill for Love is perhaps most 
remarkable in its ability to skillfully 
evoke a specific sense of atmo-
sphere while never forgetting the 
importance of good songwriting. 
Though it likely comes as a surprise 
to listeners expecting more stylish 
night-disco, Kill for Love stands as 
an excellent, surprisingly consistent 
follow-up.

After experiencing steadily growing 
hype culminating in a rambunctious 
SXSW set opening for Jack White, 
Alabama Shakes, an Alabama-based 
buzz band that combines soul music 
with traditional Americana, has finally 
released their much anticipated debut 
album.

Boys & Girls is rife with tracks that 
embody soulful, back-to-basics rock ‘n’ 
roll. Without the frills of many modern 
bands and a palpable influence by their 
formation in America’s “Bible Belt,” 
Alabama Shakes’ sound is a blend of 
Southern rock, gospel and timeless, 
vintage soul.

Their first single “Hold On” show-
cases lead singer Brittney Howard’s raw 
vocals, which fall somewhere between 
pretty and gritty. 

Boys & Girls displays an admirable 
amount of sonic diversity: “Goin’ To 
The Party” is a short and sweet tune 
that changes up the tempo, time and 
sound — reminiscent of an offbeat yet 
deliciously cool White Stripes song. 
The Shakes take it down a few notches 
on tracks like “Hang Loose,” a breezier 

and more carefree number about tak-
ing it easy and knowing that “you’re 
gonna be alright.” “I Found You” goes 
for subdued soul rather than rocking 
ferocity, making it a more beauti-
ful number and allowing Howard’s 
smooth and sweltering vocals to shine 
through.

“Heartbreaker” unfolds in the same 
vein — a backdrop of drumrolls and 
piano keys under Howard howling 
about her heartache. This song, like all 
of Boys & Girls, showcases the personal 
in a loud and bittersweet way, making 
it impossible for the listener not to feel 
right there with her and believe every 
word she says.

Youth Lagoon is the recording project of San 
Diego-born twenty-two-year-old songwriter 
Trevor Powers. As Youth Lagoon, Powers crafts 
achingly melodic, sentimental synth-pop that 
has recently catapulted him into blog stardom. 
Last year’s The Year of Hibernation skillfully 
balanced dream pop’s sense of atmosphere 
with a pop-minded attitude. Particularly 
exciting is the opening act, glammy Italian 
synth-rockers Porcelain Raft. (AW)

Geographer trades in bright, dancey 
pop music reminiscent of bands like

West Regional appearances and three 
regular season titles. 

Last season, the Tritons earned 
the program’s first-ever No. 1 national 
ranking in the USA Today/ESPN 
Coaches Poll. UCSD’s 2011-12 squad 
also amassed the program’s longest 
winning streak, with 26 straight wins. 
The Tritons lost just one game in their 
regular season before falling in the 
West Regional Final of the National 
tournament. 

“Charity had an incredible five-
year run at UC San Diego and her 
team’s record over that time speaks 
for itself,” Senior Associate Athletic 
Director Kenneth Grosse said in an 
email interview. “But her impact went 
well beyond the court. Her players 
reflected the academic priorities of the 
university, she developed excitement 
around her program and could always 

be counted on for leadership in the 
department. We’re definitely going to 
miss Charity, but wish her the best 
at [Loyola] and know that the Triton 
program will continue to flourish 
under new leadership, in large part 
because of the solid foundation she 
has laid.”

Elliott will have her work cut out 
for her at Loyola Marymount, which 
went 8-22 overall last season and 3-13 
in the West Coast Conference. 

“I am looking forward to this 
next step in my career, but I know 
there are many great things to come 
in the future for the UCSD Women’s 
Basketball program,” Elliott said to 
the UCSD Athletic Department. “I 
am looking forward to following the 
team’s success.”

Oklahoma, Western Washington, 
Mills College, UCSB and Chapman, 
the women’s varsity eight boat 
finished with a time of 7:25.43, 
good for second place just behind 
Central Oklahoma. The Triton 
women also competed in the Carley 
Copley Cup, finishing fifth amongst 
Division-I opponents. 

In the second day of 
competition, the Triton varsity 
eight advanced to the final, 
where they placed fourth behind 
Humboldt, Central Oklahoma 
and UCSB’s A shell, with a solid 
time of 7:54.32. While the Triton 
novice topped their heat with a 
time of 8:20.45. “We’re very pleased 
with our fourth place finish in 
[the Grand Final], qualifying for 
the race so we’re pretty excited,” 
varsity eight captain Alyssa Dixon-
Word said. “Our freshmen placed 
first in their event, which was 
very exciting. They obviously 

have a lot of talent.” On Monday, 
April 1, UCSD faced off against 
Western Washington, falling to the 
Vikings by just under 30 seconds. 
The Tritons honored their five 
graduating seniors — Carolyn 
Belak, Katie Holstein, Natassia 
Peterson and Ellen Umeda — at 
their last home meet of the year.

The Tritons have three weeks to 
prepare for their next regatta, to be 
held in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 

Travaglione says the Tritons 
will be working hard in the interim 
to claim a place in the national 
tournament. 

“Overall, we did extremely well 
and hopefully we will continue to 
improve for regionals so we can 
qualify for nationals,” Travaglione 
said. “After having a week of triple 
and double days, I think everyone 
was happy with our performances.”

Sophomore hurdler Lauren Irish 
also posted a standout performance, 
finishing sixth in the 400m hurdles 
with a time of 1:02.52, just 0.02 
seconds off of a NCAA National 
qualifier. 

The women’s 4 x 400m race was 
the second fastest ever run by a 
UCSD team at 3:43.89. Freshman 
Sabrina Pimentel stepped up after the 
usual first leg, senior Caitlin Meagher, 
contracted an asthma attack and 
could not race. Pimentel ran a solid 
57 second split followed by Irish, who 
split a 56 second time, and senior 
Deyna Roberson, who also split a 
56 second mark before handing off 
to Rose. Rose got the baton in third 
place, 50 meters behind Irvine’s 
Ericka Nowell. Rose fought hard, 

making up all of the ground between 
the two runners with a blazing 53.1s 
second split to barely fall short of 
second place. For reference, the 
Olympic qualifying time for a 400m 
run is 52.35 seconds.

Junior javelin thrower Jessica 
Miklaski threw well to finish in third 
place in her event, popping off a 
137’6” mark to uphold her spot as 
the best javelin thrower in the CCAA 
conference. 

The women finished 11th overall 
in a field of twenty teams, and the 
men finished 8th in a field of 19 
teams.

Leading the men’s side were 
seniors Ka Wai Ng and Nicholas 
Howe. Ng finished third in the triple 
jump after scratching several of his 
best marks, ending with a 49’2.5” 

hop skip and a jump well short of his 
personal best. 

Howe’s throw of 214’3” was also 
well short of his personal best, which 
opened the door for Cal State Long 
Beach senior Benjamin Woodruff to 
take the competition with a throw of 
235’10”. 

Other big marks on the men’s side 
came from Zachary Nagengast in the 
discus, who finished in sixth with a 
hurl of 156’6”. 

Senior long jumper Jeff Head 
finished sixth as well, jumping 23’3”. 

The throws squad on the men’s 
side is especially strong going into 
their next meet, with an intense 
sibling rivalry brewing. Senior Kiley 
Libuit threw 199’11” at Cal-Nevada to 
set a new personal best. However, his 
mark failed to beat that of his older 

brother Brad, who graduated in 2006 
with the school record at 200’. The 
younger Libuit now heads to Arizona 
with a chip on his shoulder much like 
the one on the shoulder of freshman 
Nash Howe. The younger Howe is 
looking to break out from behind his 
brother, the current school record 
holder at 231’6”. 

The Tritons now split up between 
Arizona State’s Sun Angel Invite and 
the Cal State San Marcos Mangrum 
Invite. 

Seven men and seven women will 
head out Friday for Arizona with 
head coach Tony Salerno to practice 
for the upcoming NCAA National 
Meet in May.

Record Weekend
BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

This past weekend, Saturday, March 31 and Sunday, April 1 the UCSD Track and Field 
team headed to the annual Cal-
Nevada Invitational track meet. 
The meet, now going strong for 
two decades, attracts more than 80 
percent of collegiate track teams 
from across California and Nevada. 
Only the top 27 athletes in each event 
qualify to participate, so for UCSD, a 
large field of Division I schools made 
for a high level of competition. 

The biggest storyline coming out 
of the meet was senior Jacqueline 
“Boo” Rose’s record breaking 
weekend. The women’s sprint 

captain won her heat in the 400m on 
Saturday to qualify her in lane six for 
the final the following day. She was 
ranked second going into finals with 
a time of 55.6s, chasing a 55.4s mark 
recorded by Cal State Fullerton’s Katie 
Wilson. Rose not only beat Wilson in 
the final with a time of 53.3s, but she 
also broke the previous UCSD school 
record of 54.9s set by Olympian 
Christine Merrill in 2008. 

Rose’s time broke the previous 
record by over a second, making 
her the fastest female 400m runner 
in DII and fourth in the entire 
collegiate realm. She also became 
the second Triton in a row, following 
2011 graduate Kelly Fogarty’s win 
last year, to be awarded the coveted 
Cal-Nevada Track Athlete of the 
Year. The award marks the seventh 

all-time award given out to an athlete 
mentored by UCSD sprint coach 
Mick Gieskes.

“It was really hard,” Rose said. “I 
was just so anxious and nervous that 
I reached another level. I laughed at 
myself as I was getting into my blocks 
because I was so nervous, I just 
decided then, ‘ok lets do this.’”

When asked if she thought there 
was more in the tank, Rose said 
there’s still room for improvement. 

“I really think there is because for 
the last 15 meters I was looking for 
the clock to see how fast I was going,” 
Rose said. “That made me lose a bit 
off my stride and probably meant the 
difference between a 53 [second time] 
and a high 52 [second time].”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL —After 
five years at the helm of the UCSD 
Women’s Basketball team, head 
coach Charity Elliott has accepted the 
head coaching position at Division I 
Loyola Marymount. It was announced 
Tuesday, April 3 that the three-time 
conference coach of the year will take 
over for Loyola coach Julie Wilhoit. 

“I am truly, truly grateful for 
my time and experience at UC San 
Diego,” Elliott said to the UCSD 
Athletic Department. “I am so proud 
of the success we’ve had as a program 
and I thank all of the student-athletes 
that have allowed me to coach them 
and, in doing so, provided me with 
countless memories that will last a 
lifetime.”

Elliott began her career at 
Southwest Missouri State where she 
served as assistant coach. She received 
her first head coaching position at Cal 
Baptist, and after two seasons with 
the Lancers, took a job at Division I 
Portland State. Elliott led the Vikings 
to their first Big Sky conference 
tournament in three years. 

Elliott came to UCSD in 2007 
and has since recorded 131 wins with 
the Tritons, leading UCSD to four

CREW —The UCSD women’s 
rowing team recorded promising 
finishes, while the Triton men 
came back with mixed results last 
weekend at the 39th Annual San 
Diego Crew Classic.

The three-day regatta, held in 
Mission Bay, hosted 4,000 athletes 
from some of the best teams in the 
nation— including UCLA, Gonzaga 
and USC on the men’s side and 
seven-time defending national 
champions Western Washington on 
the women’s side.

On Saturday, March 31, the 
women’s varsity eight, men’s novice 
and men’s second varsity eight all 
recorded second-place finishes in 

the first day of competition.
On the men’s side, the Tritons 

failed to reach last year’s high 
water mark. The men’s varsity 
eight finished last in their heat, as 
UCSD fell to Harvard, Cornell and 
University of British Columbia, 
despite clocking a quick 6:14.588 
time.

“We knew going into the Crew 
Classic that we needed to perform 
well,” varsity eight rower Ashley 
Travaglione said. “We hadn’t put 
together a solid race, but after 
coming off a week of technical/
speed work practices, I think 
we all were feeling ready for the 
weekend.”
