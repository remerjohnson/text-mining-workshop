Editor's Note: Last week tbe TRITON TIMES publisbed an 
article exploring student discontent with bousing, ID this 
article tbe TT explores some of tbe reasons for bigb bousing 
costs and wbat steps are being taken to ease tbe burden on 
tudents, 

Rick Drom 
Of the eight University of California campuses with 

comparable housing, UCSD has the third lowest residence 
housing rates, according to information compiled by George 
Matson, campus Associate Business Manager. Only UCD and 
UCI have lower rates than UCSD. In these eight campuses 
residence hall rates increased last year an average of over $80 
per campus. At UCSD the rate increase was $45. 

There are many reasons why the rates at UCSD are at their 
pre ent level according to Matson . The first reason has to do 
with the original planning philosophy for the colleges. When the 
colleges were being planned it was assumed that most, if not 
all. of the students would eat in the school cafeterieas. 
Evidence of this can be seen in the fact that the Unit I dorms at 
Revelle , the "brownstones", were not originally built with aDY 
kitchen facilities. 

Thus a student's housing costs would be automatically 
combined with food costs. For this reason money was gathered 
to finance construction of both facilities together. But this 

philosophy has not worked. 
The first years UCSD used a type of closed cafeteria system 

where faculty and staff could eat there but had to buy a full 
meal. This system failed to work . Then UCSD instituted a 
system where faculty members and others could eat in the 
cafeterias on an a la carte basis. Students were issued pap r 
money, " script," to pay for meals. This system failed to work. 
Thi year UCSD instituted a system of a la carte food where 
you only pay for what you eat. 
. But since 1965, the resident students have been paying the 
1 et Revenue Assesment on the cafeteria as well as the dorms. 
Net Revenue Assessment, NRA, is an involved term which 
mea ns, essentially , the paying off of the bond needed to 
finance construction and a reserve for major maintenence of 
bUildings . This is an important point because RA was over 
half of the Residence Hall Budget this year . 

Thus this year students are paying , along with housing co ts. 
the RA on the cafeteria, the utilities of the cafeteria and the 
grounds co t... whetber they use tbe cafeteria at a\l or Dot , This 
becomes more meaningful if one realizes that the utilities cost 
alone for the three cafeterias is $43.920 this yea r : together with 
!'iRA. maintenance and repair , grounds, etc , this means that 
the reSidence halls are paying $212,797 for the use of the 

cafeterias! 
Under the present arrangement the cafeteria, under the 

direction of Holly Holmes, food operations only pay labor and 
food costs plus liz of the telephone costs U spite this 
arrangement, the cafeteria reported in a recent residence 
hall board meeting a deficit of $8 ,000 so far this year at 
Revelle. 

Changes in dorm 
administration 

may lower rates 
Thus one of the reasons that the cost of a room at CSD IS at 

i's present rate is the original concept that room and board 
would be together. Another reason is the type of housing which 
was constructed at UCSD. 

The type of construction specified for UCSD was very sturdy 
and expensive. " It was designed to last a long time. be very 
fire-resistent and safe." according to Ernie Mort. resident 
dean at Revelle College. Because of this Argo and Blake dorms 
cost $6 ,395 per bed . This IS in contrast with the dorms 
constructed on Matthews campus for $3,716 per b d. "It IS thiS 
latter type , small wooden units. which one would find In the 
community," said Oscar Norr, campus Ausillary Enterpnses 
Manager , " Rather than the large. heavy. reinforced concrete 
housing at Revelle." 

An additional factor in the Hall rate is lOflatlOn . Mat on 
recently recieved a letter from the niversity adlvsing him to 
plan for increased labor costs of at lea t 512 per cent In 
addition to this utility costs were recently raised But what IS 
being done about these problems? 

The group in charge of housing IS the Hou Ing Policy 
Committee. According to the current student directory. "The , 
committe is re ponsible for setting the rates In the dorm 
after advisement from the Business Office, for e. labhshtng th<:! 
regulations for on campu housing and for much of the advlcc. 
not building of the dorms." Thi 20-member committee IS 

-rlon 
Volume IS, Number 9 University of California, San Diego

composed of four students as well as deans resldenc' hall 
manager etc 

Matson , chairman of the committee. IS try 109 to r orj1amze 
the houslOg debts and separate reSident sp<lces from ~:)<lce

first time that anyone has determtned who use and thu s.1ould 
pay for what As a re ult some ar a . Itke th South Dlmng 
Room may be paid for out of Registration Fees b ('aus~ th 
student body u es it In tead of Just reSidents 

Another effort is belOg made to change the pre ent food 
svstem In order to make the svst m more fflclent and thus 
b' able to pay a greater share of ItS debt ervlce and uttlltt !' 
Without raising price . many Ideas are belOg tnv stlgated One 
poSSible change would b to require all stud nts to buv a 
$l0/week meal ticket. ThiS ticket would be like cash, could be 
spent anv time dUrtng th year. but would give th cafterta a 
guaranteed lOcome to work With Nothing ha b en d clded yet 
A committee has b en formed to work With Herman Johnson , 
Vice-Chancellor of Buslne s and Finance. to work on th 
problem The problem I big. as Tom Hull. dean at Revell 
said. we've gone the full circle. from a mandatory food plan to 
a totally a la carte. But we are still haVing problems. 

Some help for RBS houstng (Umversity Resldenllal 
BUlldtng Systems, I e. MUir Apt I could be obtained from the 
Regents, who Will now prOVide an equity 10 uch project , 
according to Rick Mann. memb r of the HOUSing Poltcv 
Committee If Third Colleg decides to use URBS It houstng 
can be budt for 30 p r cent les than prevlou Iy anttclpated 
ThiS Will have the effect of stablllZlng all rates Other ubsldles 
are also belOg lOvestlgated. such a tate or federal finanCial 
help 

Another suggestIOn belOg explor d would be to reorganlz' 
the cafetenas and po iblv clos down the cafeterta at Third 
College which I 10 109 the mo t mon v. Becau. e of thle 
reorganizatIOn. personnel the greate t ' tngle co t, might 
po slblv b reduced 

But the Regent must b able to conttnue to get enough 
revenu to pay off the d bt service on Its Bonds. If It can not do 
this . ectlOn 4 10 of th Regent· " Indenture' require that th 

ntv rslt:.' ' e tablt hand matntatn panetal rul ." to enabl

would be that all freshman and ophomores would b required

news from 

lit Dept. opens informal discussions 
A general "complaint and advice" session. giving students a 

chance. to air their gripes on the hterature department. will be 
held thiS Wednes~ay at 4 p.m. in the Revelle informal lounge. 

Any students 10terested 10 the department are invited to 
attend and . to express their. thought on existing literature 
courses. ThiS Will also be a lime for making suggestions as to 
how the department can make the stud v of literature more 
meaningful to those at UCSD. . 

"These meetings can be a good way for students to Influence 
cUrriculum." said Dr. Abraham Dijkstra . "Students mavcome 
together and determ10e a speciftc ubject in which they are 
mterested. Many of them are not aware of the Literature 
department ' great flexibility in regard to student - designed 
cUrriculum ,. 

Through these 1Oformal sessions. the department hopes to 
break down the distance bet ween the undergraduates. 
graduates. and faculty members. Another function of these 
sessIOns may also serve as the source of other literature -
onented programs 

The get-together tomorrow IS the fourth In a sequence of 
Wednesday afternoon meetings spon ored bv the Literature 
department Pa t meetmgs have had diSCUSSions by Professor 
Szanto on his play The ell' Black Crook. professor Benito 
Brancaforte on the freedom of the arllst versus the ocial 
order. and graduate student Bud Korkowskl on the uses of 
Freud in hterature 

Since the purpose of these meetings IS to create a casual. 
spontaneous means of communication between the facult\' and 
students. the~' remain fairly unstructured POSSible futu re 
tOPIC mclude poetr~ readmg b\ undergraduates and the 
shov.lng of a student-made film on the feminist movement 

Student are welcome to submll any topics for future 
diSCUSSIOns or to become moderator of one of the diSCUSSIOns In 
which thel have a particular Interest Question, or comment

Blackhawks Streak 
to 86-79 Victory 

The UCSD Blackhawks met 
the Southeast San Diego Bucks 
coached by former San Diego 
Chargers Defen~iv~ Back. 
Kenny Graham. The game got 
off to a slow start for the first 
SIX mmutes . passing and 
rebounding was poor 

UCSD's Gie Simpson scored 
the first points of the game and 
went on to be high point man of 
the game· scoring 28 points 

The Buck who were down bv 
11 at halftime ( 44·3~) came 
back fired up and showed a 
good deal of poise-ball control 
was good. The bucks were 
inspired by Billy Mooreland 
who was the second high point 
man in the game . scoring 26 
points. With 8:42 remaining in 
the game Bucks were within 6 
and it looked as though the 
Blackhawks were in trouble. 
When D. Steele, second highest 
scorer for the Bucks (20 points ) 
fouled out - it looked as if the 
Bucks might lose their spark, 

but six mmutes later they were 
within 3. . 

The Blackhawks ' fans 
cheered them on and in less 
than a minute they had taken 
the lead aga lR - leading by 7. 

The last two minutes were 
the most exciting and it was 
easv to understand whv 
basketball IS a spectator spori. 
The spectators were on their 
feet chanting ' "Fire It up" . 
"Fire It up" - c1appmg their 
hands saymg " Its all over hey" 
- "Its all over. hey" - " Its all 
over, hev" ' 

Blackhawks appreciate the 
support the student body has 
given it. A new feature was 
added to the halftime 
activities, namely JAZZ. Many 
students felt that this was 
mu ch better than the 
traditional form of halftime 
enterta inment - this will 
continue to be a part of the 
Bl ackhawks ' halftim e 

, activities.

Ebony Trounces 
LJ Street Gang 

The biggest game of the intramural basketball season to date 
found the hustl ing, hot-shoot mg. tough blacks from EBONY 
overpowering the taller LA JOLLA STREET GANG by the 
score of 70·53. Ca ptain Gie Simpson played an outstanding all-
around game. leading hiS team in scoring with 20 big ones. 
playing intimidating defense against big Mark Sanders, and 
consistently hitting the boards hard in order to get the release 
for the EBONY fast break . 

EBONY played its game to near perlection ... Iotsa pressing, 
lotsa hustling. run·and-gun. In addition. while forcing the 
GANG IOto turnover after turnover. the blacks managed to 
dominate board play at both ends of the court by moving 
quickly for good inside position. The STREET GANG , whose 
shooting in the first half was positively frigid . looked like they 
had left their game in the streets of La Jolla. Sanders. 
Woodward , Heiser and Green simply could not connect with 
anything. As a result. the halftime score was 35-18. EBONY. 

The second period fo und the GA G's Steve Meerson (15 
points) doing some fine outside sharpshooting. only to be 

. matched basket for basket by Simpson and stalwart Eli Curtis. 
Eli . who also had 15 points. wa a tremendous steadying 
influence for the brothers : when they needed a basket, he got 
It : when a rebound was crucial. Eli pulled it down. and if 
EBONY began to turn the ball over. Curtis would slow down 
the pace by bringing the ball upcourt himself. Toward the 
middle of the final penod Sanders and John Woodward began to 
playas everyone knew they could . but it wa a case of too 
little. too late for the STREET GANG . Even when Simp on 
fouled out with SIX minutes left. the GANG was unable to make 
a last-ditch run at the lead. which was as much as 22 points at 
one time. 

What about a rematch' If both teams make It. it wou ld be the 
fi nals of the intramural playoff . The vistor just might be the 
team that wants It more In this case. it was clearly EBO Y.

OPINION ... eoltlDued 
The Int~U~~~!lal Odyssey of Jim Sills 

[n the article, .. Why I am Conservative," Jim Sills feebly 
attemp~~ to rat,l,onahze a r~actionary maneuver. How anyone' 
can be forced Into a political posture "against his will" is 
beyond ,my comprehension, Without examining the will of the 
person Involved or. the strength of the position sustaining that 
will. on~ could easily follow a seemingly logical process based 
on nothing. Of s~ch va lue is the procedure in which Mr. Sills 
engages In hiS sh ift from liberal to conservative 

As I.he article climaxes in an " incredible scen~ ... a wrenching 
~oul: rtpplng Instant that wili end political illusions," his 
JUStifica tIOn for a ch~nge from democrat to republican is 
estabhshed . At thiS POint ,. however , the cla rity of the cause is 
mudd led by several ,questions. Were the democrats directly or 
mdlrectly Involved In this " incredible scene?" Had Mr. Sills 
been present when leftists were being intimidated (for 
mstance , when James Rector was shot) , would he have 
become radical Instead? Or even further, how could either 
party of a system that vomited Humphrey and Nixon into the 
nallon~l polls be connected with , or .advocates of, student 
unres~. The apparent failure of Mr . Sills to examine any of 
these Issues becomes an Indictment of hi maneuver . 

His justification for political change is closely ~lIied with 
that of the reVISIOni sts and super·simplifiers in Alvin Toffler 's 
Future . Sbock. Through their vague and insecure 
generalizatIOns, these people find solace in the law and order 
logans of such creatures as Wallace and Hitler . Their solutIOn 

for national turmoil is a mere shift to the right. whore they 
become p~oponents of 'bloodbath ' politics and the endles's 
power taCllcs of our present. so-called 'leaders.' "Lulled " Into 
~~e " slee~y , happy stupor" that Mr. Sills deSCrIbes as 

pleasant. . they are unable to view existing value systems 
Wlt~ negative and detached thought. Thus, the vehicles of 
SOCial protest parade before them as a "circus or carnival .. 
However, the refusal to diSCUSS or acknowledge the exis tence 
of grou~ds for social protest is more responsible for the 
frustra tIOn and tension which inevitably erupts In 
confrontatIOn than anyone factor determming such conflicts . 

. Mr. SiI~s will probably contend that he could never become 
mvolved In rea.ctionarv platforms. But the fact stands that he 
moved ~o a rtghtlst position for reasons. or rather vague 
associations, that have no connection whatsoever Acllon 01 
thiS na.ture can only be correctl v evaluated m light of ItS effect 
on natIOnal motivation . [n other words , it culminates In the 
o ler-reactlve propensi tie which generate the Mv-Lals and 
Kent States of Middle Amenca . . 
" Thi~ leads me to believe that Mr Sills IS completelv Without a 

Will to speak ~f. Propelled by the fear of unexammed. and 
t~erefore alien. Issues. his solution for national unrest IS a 
Simple move to the right Clearly, hiS atlltudes are dangerous 
m that he seeks to influence, through melodrama. those who 
would Jom and sustain his " Intellectual od.vssey "
