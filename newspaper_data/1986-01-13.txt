UC reaches out 
in Central Valley 

The University of California 
announced plans to open a 
Fresno Regional Office, a first for 
the UC system. 

The new venture's primary 
goal is to ensure that students in 
the Central Valley have ready 
access to information about 
academic programs at all the UC 
campuses. 

"We see this new venture as a 
complement to the excellent 
program already offered by 
Fresno tate University," said 
William Baker, UC vice 
president for budget and 
university relations. III makmg 
the announcement 

··It is our expectation thal our 
new office WIU work with Fresno 
Stale UnIvensty and the 
community colleges and high 
schools in the Central Valley, III 
a whole spectrum of education 
and cultural programs," Baker 
said. 

The new office will include a 
staff of three counselors from the 
University'S Office of Relations 
with Schools. 

"The Relations with Schools 
staff will work with high school 
and community college 
counselors m the Central VaUey 
to familiarize them more fully 
with university programs and the 
kind of student preparation 
needed for university admission," 
said Alice Cox, UC assistant vice 
president for student academic 

sen'ices. 
'They will also Visit schools to 

identify prospective studel sand 
provide information about aU UC 
campuses," she said . 'The 
counselors will be able to answer 
students' questions about 
academic programs, finanCial 
aid, housing and other 
concerns." 

The new service IS in response 
to requests UC President David 
P. Gardner received from many 
individuals and community 
groups when he Visaed Fresno 
in the fall of 1984. 

The percemage of Cemral 
Valley high school graduates who 
enter UC is less than half the 
state average. In 1984, the latest 
data available, 7.5 percent of the 
state's graduati ng high school 
seniors entered UC as freshmen. 

More than 300 panicipants in 
the program have already gone 
on to higher education and more 
than 1,000 others are now 
enrolled in the program. 

The university has 16

community service programs in 
the Valley, tnvolving more than 
500 faculty, profeSSional staff and

Media board will 
pursue new proposal 
By CHARMAINE HARA VEY 

REPRESENTATIVES OF alternative media publications contested the 
proposed new media guidelines 
which would limi t funding 10 
$4,000 per publication with 
Communication Commisioner 
Michael Fahlbusch and the 
media board in a meeting Friday 
afternoon. 

Fahlbusch and the media 
board stressed that the 
controversial proposal is based 
on "equity and efficiency," and 
that 10 be implemented it must 
be brought to vote before the AS 
this Wednesday, without funher 
delay. "If it is tabled again, it will 
be tabled indefinitely," said 
Fahlbusch. 

"The logical and fair thing 
is . .. that the students should be 
the ones who decide on this. Put 
it to a vote, a referendum," said 
Byron Monon of the new 
indicator collective. 

Regarding such a referendum, 
"I , personally, am for student 
suppon, but somethmg has to be 
done now," Fahlbusch said. 

Fahlbusch also denIed 
repeated a cusatlons from Mike 
Chavez of Vo:: Fro,,[cn;:a that 
Fahlbusch had "ra ilroaded" hiS 
proposal through the A.5. 

Fahlbusch will try to pass his 
proposal in the AS immediately, 
and then put it on the student 
ballot in the spring, he said. He 
IS confident it would be 
supponed by the students. 

Running a referendum after 
passing the proposal in the 
council would be illogical and a 
waste of time, according to 
Monon. "Why enact a piece of 
garbage and then nuUify it?" he 
said . 

Falbusch objected to Monon's 
denunciation of his proposal. "All 
I hear is critiCism on this 
(proposal)," he said. "But nothing 
else has officially come up in 
opposition . Nothing has been 
prese nted, from any side, at all. 

"Where are the alternative 
media? We have eight and there 
are three here," he said. 
Representatives from the New 
Indicator, Voz Fmntenza and the 
California Review were present at 
the meeting, arranged by 
Fahlbusch after last Wednesday's

A.S. meeting, which many felt 
allowed 100 little time for 
discussion of the issue. This 
Wednesday will be the list 
chance for opposition by any of 
the alternative media, 

Representatives of the 
publication opposi ng the 
proposition felt 100 little time 
had been given to them to come 
up with alternatives to the new 
guidelines. The periods before 
fall quaner final exams and 
during Christmas break were 
"nOl realistic" for coordinating 
opposition, Chavez said. 

The AS should not continue to 
raise student fees With the 
increase of both the srudent 
population and the probable 
increase in alternative 
publications on campus, said 
Chris Alario of the California 
Review. "I don't suppon the 
proposition outright, but I do 
support the spirit of the issue," 
he said . 

The situation at the media 
budget discussion is a "Catch 
22" where council doesn't want 
10 allocate money on the baSIS of 
content, but where a paper's 
value IS considered on that very 
basis:' said Greg McCambndge 
of the media board . "It's easier to 
critiCize than to create 
alternatives," he said . 

The same issues are raised by 
the same people at every 
dIS usslon of medla funding, 
WIth little progress toward 
resolution , Fahlbusch said. 
"Where is the mobilization? 
Everyone talks about how 
powerful the media is. I've seen 
this (repetition) for so long," he 
said. 

Represeming the readers of 
the alternative media is also 
di fficult in the budget meetings, 
said Chavez, as no reader polls 
or studies have been taken. 
Monon proposed seeking the 
help of UCSD "media expens," 
such as communications faculty, 
for such an undertaking. 

Fahlbusch responded that a 
lack of time and money have 
prevented the AS from taking 
such a poll. 

What remained of the media 
budget after allocations to

Graduate issue j9r rej~rendum 

GSA works for new activity fee 
By RACHEL FREIFELDER, News Editor 

T HE GRADUATE STUDENT sociology representative , Alice Association (GSA) is Green. plannmg a referendum for A petition drive begins this 
this spring in hopes of quarter to collect the 230 (10 
establishing a graduate-student percent of all grad students) 
activity fec similar to the 
undergraduate fee that suppons 
the Assoclated Students. 

The five-dollar quarterly fee 
would be lower than activity fees 
already in effect at every other 
UC campus. It would pay for 
activities sponsored by the GSA, 
according to the GSA President 
Susan Hinton. 

"We need people to realize 
that to have a GSA, to have the 
kind of activities we sponsor, it 
has to be funded," Hinton said. 
The group presently receives a 
percentage of the Student Center 
budget, but this may change after 
this year with the expected 
increase in undergraduate 
enrollment. 

Graduate students pay the 
same $12.50 Student Center fee 
as do underl!raduates: 2.300 
graduate students provide a total 
of $23,000, slightly more than 
the $19,000 GSA budget. 

signatures necessary to put the 
referendum on the ballot. 

Green is one of the twO 
organizers trying to bring the 
studems to the polls, which 

entails personally contacting 
every graduate student and 
explatning the issue. "It's a lot of 
people to call, but that's the way 
to do it if you want to get out 

the vote ," she said . Each GSA 
representative is expected to caU 
half the students in their 
depanment. 

Both Himon and Green are 
confident that graduate students 
will support the)ee. "We sent 
OUt surveys in Ihe past that have 
come back overwhelmingly tn 
favor," Hinton said. "It's just a 
matter of getting people to 
understand what the Graduate 
Student Association is, what II 
does and that it's in their 
interest to have a GSA; and if 
they want to have it, it's 
necessary to fund it. 

"The biggest problem is JUSt 
convincing graduate students to 
go outside in the sunshine and 
try to figure out how to do this 
thing: she said . 

To be approved by the 
gradu:.te students, the proposal 
requires a simple majoriry with at 
least 20 percent of all UCSD 
graduate students voting. "My 
goal is to get 70 percent of the 
graduate students to vote," Green 
said. 

The GSA referendum will 
coincide with the undergraduate 
elections run by the Associated 
Students, so as to economize by 
simply attaching a separate page 
to the ballot, according to GSA

Home cooked terror(ism) 
By KATHY BECKETT, StaffWnter 

In the past week, President 
Reagan has implemented several 
policies deSigned to Isolate and 
pUlllsh Libya's Col. Moammar 
Khadafi for h is alleged 
sponsorship of th e recent 
terrorist raids in Rome and 
Vienna. The terrorists. members 
of a radical Palestinian group 
called Fatah Revolutionary 
Council opened fire on innocent 
by-standers, ktliing at least 17 
men, women and children In 
response, PreSident Reagan 
declared , that the terronsts 
"VIOlated all standards of CIVilized 
conduct." The path chosen as the 
means of recourse for the 
abhorrent violation , however, 
addresses only a manifestation of 
the problem rather than ItS cause. 

Many of the most ruthless and 
Violent regimes In modern 
hiStory have emerged in response 
to Western impenahsm or 
dommation. In the Balfour 
Declaration , for example. the 

British designated the land of 
Palestine as an international 
Jewish state - the result of which 
has been years of violence and 
bloodshed between the Jews and 
the Palestineans, and the creation 
of a homeless, unstable group of 
re fugees. In their desperation and 
frustration. the Palestineans have 
turned to violence as an 
expressIOn of their hostili ty and 
as an Instrument in the 
achelvement of their goals. 

A simllar rejection of Western 
standards and civilization is 
present in the leadership of the 
Ayatollah Khomeni. The Shah of 
Iran's unwelcome attempts to 
Westernize the Moslem nation , 
ofren in a repressive and brutal 
fashion, led to the subsequent 
rejectlon of Western Ideals and a 
renewed emphasis on tradmon. 
The popularity and strength of 
Khomeni , who embodies rhe 
sanctity of a secure and familiar 
past, is illustrative of rhe Intense 

resistance with which the 
pervasive and powerful culture of 
the WeStern world can be met. 

Similarly, the Khmer Rouge in 
Cambodia , with its emphasis on 
Cambodian tradition and 
nationahsm. emerged partly in 
response to (and as a solution for) 
the destruction caused by U.S. 
bombings of the Cambodian 
border during the Vietnam War. 
Hitler's National-Socialist party 
was characterized by fanatical 
nationalism and the elevation of 
the Volk (the Germanic people 
and their traditions) Its rejection 
of the democratic Weimar 
Repubh c that was forCibly 
ins talled by the Allies following 
World War I is notorious for its 
strength and monomania. In rhe 
Nica raguan revolution , the 
despotic Somoza was overthrown

Living without the 
'AlIlerican DrealIl' 
By TINA RICH, SlaffWntc, 

I keep a distance when I'm 
around the house - it's hard 
nor to, even though they're 
likeable people. Their poverty 
makes us all uncomfortable and 
it's unnerving to be near. 

There are seven of us in the 
big house not toO far from 
campus: the family, which is 
John and Eileen, their two 
toddlers and one on the way, 
Angela the nanny, Greg and 
myself. Now, with both parents 
in their late 30s, the family 
doesn't have a home of its own, 
but they do have the most 
popular career in the world : JUSt 
scraping by. 

Whether they fit the statistical 
definition of poor or not is 
irrelevant, the feeling that they 
haven't made it weighs on the 
minds of John and Eileen. We 
could say that it's not so much 
the lack of money but the 
psychological burden it 
generates, but the twO are 
inseparable. 

Considering the number of 
lonely people in the world , 
perhaps marriage and 
parenthood are personal 
achievements - when you're not 
just making ends meet. They love 
their kids , but some of the 
potential happiness of family life 
is wilted by the nagging shame 
that often comes out in John's 
snappy retorts and complaints. 
No, you can't have nice furniture 
wlth kids around; if people knew 
how much time kids take , maybe 
they would think before having 
them (" ... and , yes, I did spend 
$11 on a knife magazine , so 

th~re! ") . 
There's no show of emotion 

between the couple at all, and 
their conversation is restricted to 
the kids and pass the salt - in 
that order. Maybe they're like 

that anyway; it's hard to tell. 
It came out in the 

conversation Eileen and I had 
one morning at breakfast. Her 
tanned , 36-year-old face flashed 
cheerful hazel eyes as she 
desc: .. ibed how well her other six 
brothers and sisters had done 
wlth themselves and how she 
hadn 't. She was happy for them 
anyway. Not said, but it could 
have been carried along the 
same;: stream of thought, was an 
earlier incident when John's ex-
girlfriend put her down for not 
having done better. Our 
conversation seemed to continue 
one afternoon when Eileen was 
talking about buying a house in 
another state because California's 
so expensive; but it would be at 
least three more years - with 
the new baby on the way and 
everything, and when the oldest 
daughter started school and 
Eileen could stop paying the 
nanny . 

I'd always thought the 
American Dream was just a 
cliche. 

There is a Country-western 
song about a broken-hearted 
man who comes home, throws 
his things around and wishes he 
could do the same thmg in his 
mind . John and Eileen have 
done the reverse; it looks like 
they've thrown their minds 
around the house. The house 
looks as poor as they are and as 
dowdy as they feel. There is no 
bed in their bedroom, just 
padding on the £loor, and old 
couch, bookshelf, stereo and 
assorted odds and ends aimlessly 
scattered aout. A mess. Family 
pictures on the wall try to make 
the room look more normal, but 
their efforts dissolve in the 
disarray.

Satire vs. Fahlbusch 
Editor: 

Mr Fahllbusch's proposed 
alternative media fundmg 
scheme IS Important because it 
addresses the Issue of excessive 
spendmg on pubhcations which 
fat! to fulfill their philosophical 
and fiscal obligauons. However, 
It also seems a pseudo-solutlon 
to a problem which has 
historically been, and remains to 
be. both meqUitable and poor-
targeted . 

I thmk I may assume that 
"alternative media" fu nding stems 
from the philosophy that 
mlllority opinion (be it based in 
polltlcs, religion , race, etc.) 
deserves a proper slot on the 
exchange-of-ideas agenda. The 
importance lies not in the 
amount these publications 
receive as much as in the very 
fact that they exist at all. 
However, because the targeted 
audiences vary from several 
hundred to well over 10,000, the 
proposed scheme seems a 
grossly unfair, simplistic and 
irresponSible solution to what IS 
mstead a complex and highly 
controversial issue. 

One such pubhcation , targeted 

at anyone enrolled at UCSD With 
a sense of humor (and thus 
presumably over 90 percent of 
the student fee-paying 
population), is The Koala . ThiS 
paper IS In a unique position 
because In contrast to ItS 
fraternal altemative media, It is 
both aimed at the majority and 
better targeted vis-a-vis ItS 
audience. 

Under Fahllbusch's plan, The 
Koala would lose almost $2,000 
in student funding, and would 
be forced to drastically curtan 
publication and/or begin a 
length y and possibly 
unsuccessful advertisi ng 
campaign. With increaSing 
enrollment on the horizon , a 
planned decrease In funding for 
a paper directed at the majority 
lacks logic or rationale. 

Unofficial statistics conclude 
that The Koala IS by far the most-
read student-funded pubhcation 
and perhaps the most popular of 
all papers on campus. (sic) 
Ignoring student input calls to 
mind the questlonable AS 
regulations of the past and 
smacks of a false representation 
endemic societies which have 
decided to abolish democracy. 

Mr. Fahllbusch has said that 
he will wi thd raw hiS proposed 
pohcy should mass Opposltlon 
anse Well , although a concre te 
number remains to be assigned 
(and will hkely remain etemally

Jeny Falwell has recently 
announced that the Moral 
Majority will be changing its 
name and scope, and that the 
Liberty Federcllton , which is 
what the new orgamzalton will 
be called , will have a wider 
agenda than the old Moral 
Majomy. Newspaper accounts 

also ouoted Moral Majority 
officials who stated that a motive 
for the name change was the 
beating the Moral Majority name 
had taken in the media. 

These ofTicials are quite 
correct. "The Moral Majority is 

either" bumper stickers, 
commemary pieces in Omni 
calling for the creation of the 
"Pious Plurality" (devoted to 
insuring thar every ovum is 
fertilized ), and countless 
editorials m countless 
newspapers have all combined to 
beat the very words "Moral 
Majority" into the ideological 
equivalem of a pulp. This is in 
part what makes th e name 
change so amusing. 

Apparently, the Moral Majority. 
oops, Liberty Federation, can 't 
take the heat that comes with 
being outspokenly, actively, 
politically involved Christians. 
This alone will call down some 
media heat (an example being 
this article). Further, edltoTlal 
writers across the nation are 
probably rubbmg their hands m 
delight at the prospect of an 
organization devoted III part to 
the legislation of morality which 
has the word "Liberty" all over its 

stationary. 
Another problem is the name 

change itself. Remember when 
,Datsun changed to issan? The 
Moral Majority was an appelation 
with a high degree of 
recognition. Whether you were 
for them or agamst them, you 
knew who they were. With the 
new name, the goals and 
purpose of the organization 
become more abstract, more 
remote. more likely to be greeted 
with apathy. I'm quite sure that 
the people in charge of the name 
change didn 't want their 
organization to Simply disappear, 
or be submerged, but the current 
name, the new name, JUSt is not 
identifiable. Who would you 
rather contribute to , some new 
organization that could be a 
front for any purpose, or the 
United Way, which is a front for 
everybody? 

The only good pomt I can see 
In the new name for this 
organizatlon is the implication 
that they no longer feel that they 
are in the majority. Perhaps the 
proclamations of this new 
organization Will be humhler and 
lcss bombastic in the future .

The Berlin Wall 

Brick on brick, but rubble? 
By SUSAN PETERS, Staff Writer 

A visit to Berlin over the 
summer holidays is not 
comparable to a visit to Paris or 
London. A monument to a 
World 's Fair, or a modem art 
museum attract the crowds and 
cameras in France's capital; a tall 
and stately clock, or a bridge are 
noted by Michelin and Berlitz 
gUides as the Landmarks of 
London. Then there's Berlin , 
whose Sights include various 
museums, the remains of a 
church and an extenSive , graffiti 
covered, and infamous wall. 

It's been nearly 25 years now 
since the construction of this 
monstruous structure. During that 
time a new generation of 
Berliners has been born into this 
divided City, a generation which 
has never known the days when 
the Strasse des 17 Juni in the 
west joined with Unter den 
Linden in the east in one 
continuous stretch of road . And 
they were not there to wimess 
the construction of the political 
and actual barrier which tore the 
city and the country in two. 

For those who may have 
forgonen, or even for those who 
know the Story already, a brief 
review of the history of the 
Berlin Wall would not be without 
value. 

One night, on the 12th of 
August, 1961 , East German 
soldiers in compliance with 
orders, began to construCt a 
barrier to permanently .divide the 

east and west halves of the city 
of Berlin. Between the time the 
City was first divided politically 
at the end of World War II , up 
until that historical night, the 
number of East Germans who 
had fled to the west increased 
continuously. Threatened by a 
mass exodus to the west. and as 
a symbolic gesture of might and 
determination . the Soviet leader 
Nikita Khrushchev ordered the 
construction of an actual and 
solid wall . The morning of 
August 13, 1961 , both the east 
and west sections of the city 
awoke to the sight and shock of 
what was to become one of the 
most visual political divisions in 
the world. 

Immediately, protests rang out 
across the city on both sides. 
Demonstrations before the 
barbed wire barrier and 
confrontations with East and 
West German police continued 
throughout the following days. 
There were incidents of the 
crowd encouraglllg East German 
soldiers to drop their arms and 
flee to the West whtle there was 
still a chance. One famous 
photograph shows a soldier 
doing just that. In a series of 
shots. the young man is shown 
looking around cautiously in 
search of other guards. then he 
drops his rifle and in the final 
shot, he is shown jumping over 
the twisted barbed wire safely 
into the West where he is greeted 

by a cheering crowd. 
The fury of the people of 

Berlin 'was further fueled by what 
was almost the greater shock -
that the West was so slow to 
react. The wall had come as a 
surprise not only to the United 
States but to other Western 
nations, as well . Then, once it 
was confirmed, there was 
hesitation before a reaction to 
the Soviet aggression. Needless to 
say, it was not the best of times 
for President Kennedy who. in 
the space of a few years, was to 
face Soviet threats in various 

areas of the globe. Fear of 
nuclear conflict prompted 
Kennedy to react carefully. By 
1962 a firm stone wall was 
completed. From that time on , 
the number of escapes decreased 
drastically. There were still some 
people who managed to get 
under or ovcr the wall, however. 
Various devices ranging from 
secrct companments in cars, 
tunnels , pulleys and hot air 
balloons have been used to get 
people across. The last of these 
methods was successful for two 
families only a few years ago. 

Today in order to reach the 
city by car one must travel a 
three-hour stretch across the 
uninspiring East German 
countryside along one of the 
patchwork highways, built by the 
West Germans but maintained 
by the east. A visa is required to 
cross the country and is then 
promptly collected upon arrival 
in Berlin. 

Four flags fly over the city of 
West Berlin. Four separate 
sections mark these diVisions' 
the British sector, the French, 
the American and the West 
German, with checkpOints at 
each where one can cross over 
to the East.

the other great metropolises of 
Europe. Almost. 

There is still a sense of 
something being not quite right 
there . Perhaps it has to do with 
the remai ns of the Kaiser-
Wilhelm church which stands 
beside the busy Kurfurstendamm 
street. Across from the area 
known as "The Zoo" where a 
colorful array of peuple 
congregate (and so it is said , 
degenerate - the area is not 
unfamiliar with drug abuse and 
prostitution), half a steeple and a 
hollow roof remain. The church 
has been left untouched for 40 
years as a reminder. Beside it 
has been built a modem, 
hexagonally-shaped tower and 
church, purposely placed in 
juxtaposition with the old . 

You finally begin to discover 
what it is that feels amiss when 
you walk along one of the main 
boulevards, pass a fence, and 
find yourself looking across at 
twO Soviet tanks perched as 
monuments on a foundation. 
Between them patrol twO East 
German soldiers; 50 meters or so 
later you fll1d the wall.

languages and colors are

Continued &om paae " 
perverse twist of fa te, the wall 
has practically become an 
ani fact. 

There are also other areas by 
which to approach it. Numerous 
dead-end streets will lead you 
there. Immediately the ligures in 
the watchtowers on the other 
side pick up their binoculars and 
focus on the spectators intently. 
A wink or a wave from the West 
side may produce a discreet nod 
or wave from one of the East 
German soldiers. 

Then there is the other side. 
One can cross at one of the 
checkpoints or take the 
undergro und . A .200M ticket to 
Friedrichstrasse will bnng you to 
the side of the wall where the 
stone remains clean. Most of the 
people there are also tourists; 
without them the streets would 
be nearly empty. The few shops 
have little or nothing in their 
windows. One has Simply a 

green cunain - yet the people 
seem to know where to go. The 
cars are outdated and cheaply 
made. Apparently to own one, a 
person in East Germany must 
save up for to years or so. 

Having had to change one's 
money from West to East 
German marks at an unfavorable 
rate, it is wise to spend it while 
it has value, perhaps on a few 
souvenirs - playing cards, a 
small bottle of vodka. a pamphlet 
by Lenin: "What is oviet 
Power?" 

If one asks the West Berliners 
how they manage to continue 
their quotidian life unhindered 
by the reminder JUSt outside the 
window or one train station 
away, the answer is simple: "You 
simply have to not think about 
it." It is this 'doublethink' which 
is the striking feature of West 
Berlin.

pause for a moment and reflect 
upon the wall, this strange 
monume nt to an age which may 
be distant when we look 
backwards. but not te rribly far 
away when we look ahead and 
around. Today. other walls are 

being constructed elsewhere , and 
elsewhere other struggle's are in 
progress in an effort to dismantle 
these walls. 

In view of the recent 
demonstrations occuring 
internationally, and here on 

campus. protesting another SOrt 
of political division in the 
country of South Africa. such 
re flection become relevant. 
Attending such rallies is really a 
symbolic gesture, but it 
represents an awareness and a 
refusal to blindly accept an 
existing establishment; it 
represents a first step towards 
dismantl ing an existing wall. 
Numbers aren't important; the 
rationale and degree of sincerity 
behind active interest is. Not to 
condemn does not necessarily 
amount to condonation, but it 
makes the task greatly facilitated 
for those whose detrimental 
actions do not meet opposition. 

Imperious ideology and a 
disregard for human rights are 
what initiate the construciton; 
public and individual passivity 
are what keep it standing for 20 , 
40 years or more. We can look 
back to the construction of the 
~ wall in Berlin and recognize that 
~ it was a global abomination of 

~ the past, or we can look carefully

~ from now and keep one eye

th an the advantages of 
modernization. It is their homes 
that have been signed away by 
people in distant lands, their 
communitie s bombed and 
destroyed by a nation with whom 
they were not at war, their people 
who have proVided the labor 
from which Western society has 
grown rich . It is not surprising, 
then, that these people reject 
purponed "civilized values," nor 
that they choose extreme 
methods such as terrorism to gain 
leverage. After all, a homeless and 
powerless community such as the 
Palestinians have none of the 
means of persuasion that are 
available to the "civilized" 
nations. That airplanes and 

airpons are often chosen as the 
site for such activities is symbolic 
of the hostilitiy that is felt towards 
Western industrialization and 
wealth . 

This is nOt a defense of 
terrorism . It is merely a 
suggestion th at President 
Reagan 's so luti o n to such

Palestinian problem or even a

Without any real understandi ng 
of the nature and causes of

The GSA funds a number of 
recreational, educational and 
selVice-oriented activities, 
including a newsletter, monthly 
TGIF parties ('The first twO 
emphasized food rather than 
alcohol," Hinton said), 
interdepartmental lectures and 
programs designed to appeal to 
the entire campus rather than 
solely graduates. Last year they 
sponsored a community blood 

drive, gave $415 to the' Graduate 
Students for a Free South Afnca, 
co-sponsored the Atomicafe (a 
performance forum for graduates) 
and are helping to fund a 
feminist an show with the 
Women 's Resource Center. 

The GSA was establtshed and 
its funding imtiated following a 
1975 TA strike for improved 
wages and working condItions. 
The funds were originally 
allocated for "lounge 
improvements," according to the 
original statement, because the 

board felt graduates did not have 
a place in the Srudem Center. 

The structure is very informal, 
with no officers other than the 
president and treasurer, 
according to Hinton . 

Each department elects or 
appoints two GSA 
representatives, usually -whoever 
is willing to do it: Green said . 
"It's n(lt glamorous; it's a lot of 
work. and grad students don't 
get a gold star on their resume 
for having been on student 
l!overnment." Green said. 
Discussions are informal and 
most decisions made by 
consensus. 

Besides funding programs, the 
GSA acts as a vehicle putting

(Sociology of Health Care Issues, 
held in spring) and Philosophy

(}\leT 
a year and a half On 

II'!}' first day back ar the museum, I 
loo~ed at II'!}' surroundings and wasn't 
Impressed with what I saw. After 
all, I was In college now. I began to 
wonder why kids thought thIS place 
was so great. Then I began to 
wonder what II would be Ir~e to be 
a child explonng the museum for 
the first time. 

One day, I saw a little girl, 
dressed in a pink teddy bear 
sweatshirt and jeans, wandering 
thr~uJ(h "City Streets." City Streets 
is an open exhibit containing the 
front end of a CIty bus, a police 
motorcycle, streetlights, tIre tracns, 
parking meters, and various other 
aspects of everyday street life. 
Somehow, I wondered what it 
would be like to explore the 
museum through her eyes ... 

I ENTERED THE museum and walked through "City Streets." I got into the RTD bus and 
climbed into the driver's seat 
and watched grown ups and 
other kids passing by When 
they looked up at me from where 
they were, [ felt proud to actually 
be dnvlng thIS bus and steering 
that big wheel. Next, I went Into 
a comer JUSt behind the fire 
truck and tried on black rubber 
boots and a heavy fireman's coat. 
Afrec I finished looking at my

that room (it 
was caned "Sticky City") and went 10 
look at the strange plano that [ 
heard before . After that, I skipped 
down the bur :ing until I got 10 
another room. Above the 
entrance hung a big gray sign 
(hat said, "The Workshop Place." 
Inside, I saw other kids 
decorating a big piece of n~')er 
which was lying oli the floor. 

"Hi, would you like to come in 
and help make this mural?" 
asked one of the workers. She 
pointed to the paper on the 
floor. "You can use all of (he 
::-:aterials we have out here -
this bnght sticky tape, these 
cardboard shapes or these clOth 
strips," she said . There were 
some other murals hangtng on 
the waUs. I guess the mural I 
worked on is going to be 
hanging up there pretty soon 
too. I was almost finished 
decorating the mural when I 
heard an announcement over the 
loud speaker. 

"Attention , museum \'lS Itors , If 
you are Interested In being on 
the 11 '30 TV show, please make 
your way to the TV StudiO now," 
the vOice said. "TV" I thought, 
"They have TV here] WOW I" I left 
the Workshop Place to look for 
the TV StudiO but I didn 't have 
very far to look - It was right 
across from the Workshop Place 

The TV StudiO was re.llly neat

$10 for one dosage. The drug 
apparently does not diminish 
one's ability to perceive the 
difference berween reality and 
fantasy. The user is seemingly 
under complete control, making 
it difficult to tell If he is 
"tripplnJ(" on it, although he or 
she may act a little on the weird 
side. 

Like most Illegal drugs, Ecstasy 
IS made by street chemists, not 
pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
The danger with this drug is the 
lack of certainty of its 
co nstitution . The user is taking 
the risk that whoever made the 
MDMA has not mixed add itives 
such as rat poison into it. Even 
with a pure drug, a normal to 
high dose is bound to result in 
side effects. According to Cohen, 
high doses may produce 
hyperactivity or a paranoia. One 
user reported feeling 
claustrophobiC when she took 
Ecstasy at a pany. Also, 
sleeplessness or nervousness may 
occur. 

Whether or not MDMA is 
addicting is still questionable. It 
is probably p.sychologically 
addicting, like may recreational 
drugs, However, it may induce 
brain damage . An article in 
Scientific American states that

MDMA can damage brain cells 
containing the neurotransmitters 
serotonin and dopamine . 
Serotonin-produci ng cells control 
sleep, sex ual behavior, mood, 
aggreSSion and sens itivity to 
pain. Dopamine-producing ce lts 
initiate movement. 

MDMA can be dangerous for 
hean patients and epileptics be 
cause of its amphetamine-like 
traits. Dr. james Buchanan of San 
Francisco wmes that there is a 
pOSSibility of "a overdose or a 
severe psychological or somatic 
adverse reaction to the drug. 
Recreational use of 10 to 15 of 
the 100 mg doses in one session 
have resulted in amphetamine-

like reactlons devoid of the 
psyc hoacti\'e propenies of the 
drug '" So far three deaths have 
been presumably connected to 
MDMA, but thiS has not yet been 
confirmed. 

There is stilt much to be 
learned about MDMA in order for 
it to be used as a 
psychotherapeutic instrument. 
However, Adam's new and still 
legal analogue, Eve (MDE) is now 
being tampered with . Eve is 
similar to Adam, but allegedly 
beuer. Cohen explains, "Eve is

Electric protests 
Continued from page 14 
comrol. 

The near success of French 
students and workers at creating 
the first true revolution in a 
modem industrialized country 
shook intellectuals and political 
observers worldwide. The act of 
revolution was at hand even in 
the Unrted States, appeanng in a 
time nddled with cnSIS, and 
utllizing agent both commmed 
and curious. 

Closer to the experience of the 
students at UCSD, were the first 
important success of the student 
protests in Berkeley. The Free 
Speech Movement of 1964 gave 
students a precedent on the 
efTectiveness of direct action. 
Funhenmore, the 1965 Watts 
Riots in this Southern Cali fornia 
parldise made urban racism a 
local burning issue, literally. The 
resolution of the Berkeley student 
co nnict granted student 
organizations the right to recruit 
and carry out political agendas 
on-campus. 

The momentum of these 
successes, <.Jriginating directly 
.from the desegregation struggles 
in the South , gave students here 
a model for direct representation 
to the university administratlon . 
"Actions" became the student 

means of gelling things 
accomplished, and bureaucratic 
procedures becaml "erely 
supplementary. Thus [he events 
which rocked the UCSD campus 
in 1968-69 found expression in 
large committed student turnouts , 
directed against tne traditional 
forms represented by the 
administration. 

McGitl reflects on those 
protests: "1 adm ired the 
commitment, the willingness to 
take the moral stands of the 
students of the '60s, but I 
thought most of the stands and 
tactics were stupid (in that) they 
were designed to arouse an 
opposition." 

He continues, "When you 
think about it, if you were trymg 
to discredit the governor 
(Reagan), and you chose a set of 
methods which get him elected 
PreSident of the United States, 
and bUIld a strong majority for 
him, have you acted wisely?" 

For McGill, these protests 
embodied all the characteristics 
of a nightmare. He was caught in 
the unwinnable situation 
berween the passionate moral 
appeal of students and the 
·conservative imperative for order 
and status quo. From groups

ladies out there feel the same 
way. 

Sticks are where it's at. They're 
economical, they're clean, they 
don't make you gag, they -go on 
easily, and they don't feel like 
someone just shoved a wet 
sponge under your arm. Great 
stuff. 

Once th at matter is 
determined , you're left with 
deciding on a brand. 

I hate commercials, so I 
usually try to avoid the brands 
I've seen on TV. Trouble is , that 
leaves me with Big Bear's Simple 
Label Deodorant, often found 
between the Si mple Label Sweet 
Peas and the Simple Label 
Bleach, and aU three products 
are probably equally effective. 

That leaves me with some 
national brand name. Some of 
these get (he ax right away. 
Anything with the words "Sure" 
and/or" atural" gets ruled out 
Immediately. There is nothIng 
sure and certainly nothing 
natural about any deodorant; Just 
read the labels if you have 
doubts. 

Which leaves us with the 
other miriad and inane brands: 
Ban, Right Guard, Tickle, Secrct, 

Arrid Extra Dry, Babe, Soft & 
Dry, Adonis, Tahiti , Tussy 
(personally, I never heard of 
those last three . but those names 
came up when I went around the 
office asking, "Excuse me, what 
deodorant do you use?"), and 
probably a few hundred more . 
Many are aimed at females only, 
and many of these are aimed at 
somewhat ridiculous females only 
(e.g. , Tickle). 

As for me, [ like Mennen's 
Speed Stick. Simple stuff, decent 
price, does the job - I'm sold. 
Comes in various s ems, so that 
I have the choice of smelling like 
lImes or a spice rack or mold or 
whatever, which is an option I 
espeCIally apprecIate. 

Now that you know which 
product I use, let me add this: 
People don't get into talking 
about their deodorants. It's JUSt 
not dinner conversation . In fact, 
I don't know what kind of 
conversation it IS. I mean, it 
shouldn't be that embarrassing a 
topic; everyone sweats, most 

Monday, January 13, 1986 I 7 
FEATURES 

everyone stinks when they do 
sweat, and most everyone 
endeavors to apply something to 
mask these two facts. Still, walk 
up to someone and say, "Excuse 
me, what kind of deodorant do 
you use?" and you get some 
strange looks back. People don't 
know if they've just been insulted 
or if you're really a basketcase 
who should be aVOIded in a big 
way. Try it some time, 

And that's the wonderful world 
of deodorants - a pretty 
important world , if you ask me. 
So go ahead , ignore your 
deodorant - see if 1 care , pal. 
Some day, some day, you'll reach 
for your friend and it will run 
out on you - and you'll go 
through that day exudmg a scem 
that my Aunt Estee (Lauder) 
won't care to market, and boy 
will you be sll1ging a different 
tune. Then you'll learn to 
appreciate your deodorant and 
give it the respect and attention 
it so richly deserves. Ii:il

LJ. Classic yields mixed results for UCSD 
MVP J ungling 
paces UC past 
Claremont 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Spons Editor 

W HENEVER THE los Angeles Lakers really need a basket-I 
mean really ne.:d one-they 
usually go to the big man in the 
middle And Kareem usually 
comes through. Saturday night, 
when the women's basketball 
team won their fourth straight 
game and in doing so won the 
La Jolla Classic, coach Judy 
Malone employed the same tactic 
the lakers use. 0, Kareem 
didn't take the night off to playa 
Imle ball for the Tritons, but 
center Heidi Jungling did an 
awfully decent ImpreSSIOn in the 
middle, sconng 24 pomts and 
dominatmg the game mSlde 

Named tournament MVP 
Junglmg scored 14 pOints m the 
Tnton's opening game VICtory 
over Smith College, and received 
stellar supporting roles from 
Shellie Velie, Chns McCallum 
and Sandy Keaton as the Tntons 
held off a pesky Claremont team 
to wm 74-6b. "Heidi IS 
Improvmg with every game ," said 
coach Malone , "and when she 
plays like she did tomght, she 
can really dominate a game." 

Jungling's dommation was 
such that her absence gave the 
Athenas the momentum to get 
back in the game. Jungling left 
after getting an elbow in the face 
at the 12-minute mark of the 
second half. Claremont narrowed 
the gap to one POInt at 49-48 , 
but after an I ce treatment, 
Junglmg returned to score her 
team's next four POInts as the 
Truons held off another late rally 
to wm the game. 

·We got a really good game 
from Sandy Keaton , who hustled 
all over the court," said Malone. 
·Our strategy was to take their 

ng was named most 
~/I-toum.ry team. 
guards out of the game as much 
as pOSSible, and let our mSlde 
people take care of the rest Even 
though Shanda Elzy and Keaton 
dldn't score much, they really 
took their guards out of the 
game," 

The Tritons did get a big game 
from McCallum off the bench , 
who went mne from the hne and 
hit a number of big buckets to 
stem the Claremont tide over 
and over again. McCallum scored 
19 pomts, including a back-
breaking three point shot with 
TWO mmutes left. "We call her 
(McCallum) 'radar' because she 
has the knack of hitting some 
really hlg baskets when you need 
them-from some of the most 
awkward posltlons you'll ever 
see. 

Shelhe Velte came off the 
bench to score SIX points on 
three jumpers in the first half to 
keep UC 0 In the game when 
they began the game slowly. She 

fmished with fourteen pomts on 
SIX 01 fourteen shooting from the 
flcld. In additlon to Jungling, 
Elzy was the only other Tnton 
named to the All-tournament 
quad 

After shooting only 19 percent 
In their first wm on Friday, the 
Tntons shot 41.7 percent from 
the field against Claremont. 
'That's been our biggest problem 
so far thiS year," Malone said of 
her 4-8 team . "The offense has 
just been weak. I rely on our 
defense, but if we could have 
shot thiS well In 1985, we'd have 
a lot better record But we're 4-0 
so Eu m '86. so let's hope II 
wnnnue!. " 

The Tnrons wtll get an 
opportumty to contmue their 
J 986 streak thiS Tuesday when 
they tdke on Whittier at the gym 
at 6 pm. "It's a big game ," said 
Malone, "and we could use 
another wm before we go back 
on the road," ~

UCSD finishes third 
as Antelopes dominate 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Sports Editor 

FOR THE 1985-86 Tri ton's Men's team, winning and losing IS becoming a 
~resslng Issue. The Tritons looked 
like two different teams Friday 
and Saturday nights, and their 
ability to employ the press 
defense - or not to employ it 
- has often made the difference 
be[\veen winning and losing for 
the 8-7 Tritons. 

UCSD's third place fimsh In 
the La Jolla Classic this weekend 
exemplified some of these traits. 
In defeating the Antelopes from 
Pomona Pitzer Saturday night, 
85-71, the Tritons played as well 
as thei r press allowed them to. 
But agamst Notre Dame college, 
UCSD could not control the 
tempo and otre Dame won 
with its slow down offense 68-
62 

"Our press IS one of our most 
effeCtlve weapons," said coach 
Tom Marshall, "and our guards 
are so good that I don't fear it 
when the other team tries to 
press us But NOlre Dame's slow 
down style is exactly what gives 
us trouble." It was the TrilOn's 
ability Saturday to employ and 
destroy the press - theirs and 
Pitzer's, respectively - that 
enabled them to emerge with the 
VICtory, 

Hot shooting Brian Backens 
led the Tritons with 22 POInts, 
including his team's first 12 and 
14 of their first twenty, "It's a 
good thing Brian came out as 
hot as .he did ," said Marshall , 
"because we needed ·some points 
early on." 

Marshall was upset that the 
TrItons didn't beat Notre Dame 
because he felt Pomona was "a 
better team overall." Nonetheless, 
Marshall was pleased With his 
team's performance, "We got 
some great time off the bench 
today from guys like Mike 
Alvarado, Steve Dabasmskas and 
Bill Reese - they reaUy gave the 
starte rs some quality rest time ." 

Marshall also singled out his 
backcourt - Jim Smith , Greg 
Kamansky and Alvarado - as a 
dominant fac tor. "We're one big 
man away from being a quality 
team ," said Marshall , "and a lot 

of the time its our backcourt -
which I feel is one of the best in 
Division 111 - that keeps us in 
the game. Our frontcourt is 
young, but they're getting better. J 
expect us to get better as the 
season progresses. Guys like 
Mark Sutherlin (17 points on the 
night) arc going to be a force." 

The coach was disappointed 

Brad Kamanslly hils a free throw 
.s. Notre Dame. 

in the small turnout for the 
Classic. 'Tm reaUy proud of our 
guys. They could have folded 
after the loss to Notre Dame, but 
they came out and fought hard. 
It's nice to do that in front of 
your home crowd, but it 's too 
bad there weren't many here to 
cheer them on. I've tried every 
gimmick I know to get people 
OUt to the games, but they just 
don't show." 

Triton fans will have another 
o?portunity to show some 
support when the team hosts 
"maybe the best Point lorna 
college team ever" - according 
10 Marshall - this Tuesday at 
the gym. ~

SPORTS 

Wl RI; To WIR~JI ~~~ 
Slam, jam - but no one's mere, ma'am? - This 
weekend's Michelob-Avia La Jolla Classic certainly 
provided its share of excitement, as the women's team 
finished first and the men's team third in a tOugh 
division. The greatest excitement, however, was 
provided by the Grand Canyon College warm-up show. 
Grand Canyon (of Phoenix) is an NAlA school of 1,500 
coached by former Phoenix Sun, John Shumate. 
Shumate, not hindered by the scholarshipless dictates 
of Division 111 schools, has recruited a fine team of 
thoroughbreds which , though ragged at the edges, was 
the class of the tourney by far. 

After destroying Pomona Pitzer 90-66 on Friday, the 
Antelopes outpointed NOI re Dame (of California -
sorry folks) to win the La Jolla Classic, But the 
highlight of the tourney may have been the Antelopes' 
warm ups. Rarely - if ever - has UCSD's gym seen 
such a wondrous display of slam dunks and acrobatic 
maneuvers as the one the Antelopes put on. Six-foot-
one-inch freshman guard Gary Ward provided the best 
highlights with a seri es of jams Michael Jordan may 
have been proud to own. 

Unfortunately, very few people atte nded the Classic 
and therefore missed oU[ on quite a show of basketball , 
including the Tmons' fi ne wi n over Pomona Pitzer. As 
coach Tom Marshall lamented after the game, "i t's just 
not easy to get people out of their apartme nts and 
dorms to come to the game - for any sport on the 
campus." 
The mouth is louder than me pen - Those of us all-
too familiar with San Diego's local sportscasters know 
that channel 8's Ted Leitner is probably the most 
popular and charismatic of the bunch - which may 
be the eqUivalent of being the most popular form of 
root canal surgery. We certainly don 't want to 
disparage Ted's sledgehammer wie, or his 
bandwagoning or the annual weight reduction battles 
resulting from uncle Ted's voluminous speaking 
engagements or his insights into the obvious. 

Instead, we choose to attack Ted where it huns us 
the most. Leitner's propensity to disparage the fine 
and noble art of sportswriting has got us aU atither. 
Invariably, whenever a UPI (the writer's poll) poll or 
Hall of Fame vote comes up , Ted is there to tell us" 
how stupid writers are." Recently, the death of Roger 

Maris once again brought us the ire of a "Leitner 
Strikes" harangue. It was the writers, insists Uncle Ted, 
that beliuled Maris' feat of 61 home runs in a season, :: 
record that broke Babe Ruth's 60. It 's true that after 
Maris' 61 st it became fashionable to point out that the 
Babe hit 60 in 154 games compared to Maris' 162. 
Granted, it did trivialize Maris' record . But for Leitner 
- the consumate connoisseur of a smorgasbord of 
bandwagons - to insinuate that he is "above" such 
shortsightedness is ludicrous. 

Funhermore, Ted's medium is not what you might 
ca ll an intellectual haven, A four-minute sportscast 
(with pictures) is the equivalent of TWO or three 
headlines - somethmg, take It from us, that a chimp 
could do, But that is what makes Ted so good at 
whatever it is that he does. He doesn't know very 
much about sports, but he doesn 't have to because his 
medium demands very little acrual contact with the 
athletes themselves. His job requires that he act - nOI 
know - and Ted is a professional in that regard , Om 

Yet there are some people who for some reason or 
anorher, missed out on their share of common sense 
when God was doling it out. Case in point: New 
England Patriots General Manager Pat Sullivan in his 
recent classy performance at the AFC semifinal game 
against the Los Angeles Raiders. 

Sullivan had showered Raider defensive lineman 
Howie Long with verbal barbs throughout the game. 
"Where are you, Howie?" and "We're coming to get 
you" were a couple of the tamer insults Sullivan barked 
at Long and continued after the 27-20 Raider loss. 
LESSON # 1 In staying in one piece: DO NOT 
TAUNT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS 
especially after a loss. Dangling raw meat in fron~ of a 
hungry lion would be safer. These fOOlball players are 
gargantuan, they hit for a living, and they are not 
caged. The last time a person possessed the kind of 
balls Sulli van did involved some cat named Custer at 
Little Big Hom. ThiS situation was JUSt as foolish . 
Raider linebacker Mat! Millen came out to help his 6-

"[ saw some guy swing at Howie (Long)," said (Matt) Millen, 
"[ didn't know who the moron was, so [ swung at him." 

deadpan look to the camera for Leitner is worth any 
investigation he might have to do. 

So the next time you hear a harangue from Uncle 
Ted about writers, remember this: Ted's "book" - a 
series of "Leitner strikes" issues called , imaginatively 
enough, Leitner Strikes, is co-authored. But Ted's book 
has sold welllocaUy, proving anOther unstated Leimer 
law: it's not how much you know about the game, it's 
how much money you can squeeze out of 11. 

Then: are some things in this world that for safety'S 
sake you do not try. For example: 

-You DON'T tell Rambo, "Your Mama wears 
VietCong boots." 

-You DON'T ask a nun out for a "date ." 
-You DON'T scream Viva Castro! at aJohn Birch 

Society rally. 

foot-5-inch , 270-pound buddy against the hulking 
Sullivan, "I saw some guy swing at Howie," said Millen. 
"I didn't know who the moron was, so I swung at 
him." Millen smashed Sullivan upside his head with 
his helmet before the fight was mercifully broken up. 

Now all situations of this type should be condemned 
for the classless display put on by bOlh Sullivan and 
the two Raider players, who embarrassed their 
respective organizations with their childish playground 
outburst. All situations except this one . 

Millen and Long did what many have only dreamed 
of when placed in similar situations: They gOt even. 
"Don't let it bother your conscience ," Sullivan forgot 
that the Raiders have no conscience. 

The Raiders are black knights, rebels against the

rules and die for the hallowed silver and black If 
Miami is the NFL's version of Pat Boone, then the 
Raiders are Jerry Lee Lewis. 

Pat Sullivan embodies the exact opposite of the 
Raider image. This 33-year-old spoiled brat comes 
from one of New England's wealthiest families and his 
daddy, Billy, owns the Patriots. Pat would probably 

have a hard time distinguishing a pick from a shovel. 
Mom and Dad really blew it with this kid, He's the real

What would prompt Sullivan's he kling barrage 
against the snarling Raiders IS beyond any rype of 
human reasoning, Remember thiS guy is the Patriots' 
general manager, "I went up to him (Long) after the 
game to tell him I didn't appreciate some things he'd 
said about the organization. We have pride too," 
Sullivan would later say as he proudly displayed the 
cut on his forehead as if it were some banle wound. 
Sullivan is lucky that Millen and Long didn't

It's 

dismember hi s dough-boy body. Only "lchabod Crane 
versus Hulk Hogan and the Magnifi ent Muracco" 
would have been a bigger mismatch. 

Sullivan may have pride for his organization , but his 
organization can only suffer embarrassment because of 
him. Yet some are not surprised by his actions. "I 
didn't like those guys (the Sullivans) much when I was 
there either," ex-Patriot teve McMichael told the 
Washington Post. "J'm going to buy Matt Millen and 
Howie Long a drink next time I see them." 

Thank you Matt and Howie. If you ever come down

Ruggers show respect;

By A.C. SKIPP ARMSON 

I T'S HARD TO BE optimistic when your third-yea r rugby team IS gOing up against a 
recent national champion. Two 
years ago, Long Beach Sta re won 
it all, and last year fell to UC 
Berkeley in the final. You have ro 
have respect for a team with 
credentials like that, and the 
TritOns showed a little 100 much 
respect in thClr 20"3 loss. Prior 
to the stan of the first of twO 50-
minute scrimmages, UCSD 
standout Todd Clyde 
commented, "You hate to be 
pessimistic, but I don 't think 
we'll win tOday. It's hard to run 
against their defense. We'll have 
to kick a lot to stay close." Todd 

was right. Unfonunately, UC 
didn't have the ball enough to 
get off very many kicks. 

Long Beach State's strength 
reflects its superb coaching, 
recruiting and aggressive play. 
UCSD failed to come up with the 
ball follOWing most scrums. This 
meant playing a lot of defense 
which makes it hard to put 
points on the board. UCSD 
coach Tom Butler wanted to see 
his team at least play aggressive 
and make the tackles. HIS main 
beef with the team's performance 
was that his player's "don't seem 
to be rugby-tOugh yet. We had 
guys coming off the field with 
piddly injuries. One great thing

That's right folks . The name of 
the game is "play with pain." 

Long Beach took a 
commanding 16-0 lead Into 
halftime with a few fine runs by 
Marry Lewis and Jimmy 
Guadagno which set up tries. 
These twO players gOt your 
attention when they handled the 
ball, as did native Australian 
Mitch Stucki who scored the first 
try of the game. The Tritons' only 
highlight of the game was a fi ne 
defensive effon which stalled 
State only a few yards from the 
goal line. After a penalty kick 
pushed Long Beach back to mid-
field, the momentum 
momentarily belonged to the 
Tritons with a drive resulting in 
their only points of the game -
a three-point penalty kick by 
T odd Clyde. State re-established 
itself on their next drive with the 
final try of the game, locking up
