Volu ntary Membership: 

"The AS Will be a Very Different Kind of Animal" 
John Maxwell 

" The CSO Administration has worked hand in hand with 
the Associated Stud nts machine to corrupt th election 
process," This is the acc ation of the coalition for volun ,a ry 
AS membership , 

The coalition sponsored a petition recently which resulted in 
a referendum election being cheduled for next Wednesday 
March 1. The coalition maintains that the referendum is for an 
amendment to th AS consl1tullon, abolishing mandatory 
membership, The referendum will be worded ' " Resolved In 
ord r to provide each student with a free chOice , membership 
In the Associated Students of UC 0 shall become voluntary 
Compulsory and enforced member hip shall end," -

Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs George Murphy indicated 
to the TRITON TIMES, however , that it is University policy 
that mandatory fees are equivalent to and inseperable from 
mandatory membership, and thus th referendum concerns not 
a constitutional amendment but rather the dis-establishment of 
a fee , 

The ramifications of the disagreement are far from merely 
synt3ctical. For the adoption of a constltutional amendment. 
the election proce requires approval of two-thirds of tho e 
voting in the election, The CSO Administration has set the 
CrIteria for this election to be that 50 per cent of all the 
undergraduates must vote In the election, and a Simple 
majority of them must approve , Mike Sheerin, of the coalitIOn, 
Indicated that a 50 per cent voter turnout at UCSO is very rare 
and has not occurred In recent years 

Precedent Ignored 
The UCSO Administration claims that there are no rules or 

precedents regarding the dis·establi hment of a lee Th 
coa lillon , however, pOInted out that In last year s p clal 
elt-Cllon , which Increased the \ membership fee b\ 100 per 
cent the standard for approval was' t at two-third: 01 thos 
\otmg, which is the standard bell:g sought by the coalitIOn for 
thl. election 

The mcrea ' I.' approve by last year's 'lec.tion dlCJ not go to 
AS , but rather to a speCial lund to support EOP The 
AdmInistratIOn allowed that referendum's supporter the AS 
pr Ident at that lime ~llke Palclc,to tack the new fee Into Ihe 
AS member hip f e, aVOiding th same stiff voter turnOUI

Shepard running for Del Mar Council ' 
Kevin Olson 

The Del Mar City Council elections, 
scheduled to be held on Tuesday. April 
11 , have become of special interest to 
students with the entry of former AS 
President Tom Shepard into the race 
for councilman. Shepard, who headed 
AS during 1968·69, will be running 
against Bill Arballo, Ralph Staver, 
Richard Ripenski and Tom Pearson for 
three vacancies on the Del Mar 
Council. 

Shepard said that his main purpose 
in running was to organize the student 
voters into "a coherent body of 
collective interests." Del Mar has a 
population of 1500, of whom 300 are 
registered students, so " if they can 
organize around their common 
interests we will have a pretty 
powerful voting block." 

The central issue in Shepard's 
campaign is ecology, especially as 
applied to real estate : "We must stop 
or control the large scale development 
that is going on in Del Mar. There are 
many undeveloped areas of land in 
town , and under the present zoning 
laws they are all classified R·3, which 
means that apartments , 
condominiums. and the like can be 
built on them. Also , there are a lot of 
areas where older buildings a re being 
torn down and replaced with new 
multiple-dwelling residences. 

Mar has one of the most expensive 
rental rates on the California coast , it 
also has the largest of(·campus student 
population in the San Diego area : 
"This shows, I think. what an 
attractive and valuable community 
Del Mar is . We don't want it to turn 
into a big metropolis. or just another 
ugly suburb of San Diego." Shepard 
emphasized that all the cand idates are 
running alone, with no joint platforms 
of joint campaign activities, and that 
he. as the fir st student to ever run for 
city office, is the only candidate who 
represents student interests. "About 
the second week of March I am 
planning to hold a big meeting for all 
the Del Mar registered student 
voters. and hope to organize them on 
the basis of their common interests." 

" I have two main goals :to leave as 
much open space as possible. and , 
where buildings must be put up . to 
make sure that they are decent and of 
high·quality ... 

Shepard pointed out that while Del 

Gregory says boycott will end war 
Dick Gregory, black activist, 

c om edi a n and politi cal 
commentator . who began 
fasting JO months ago in protest 
of the Vietnam war, called last 
week for the country's young 
people to boycott until there is 
peace. 

" You young folks can end 
this war." Gregory told an 
audience at Russ Auditorium . 
" You can end it in 30 days by 
boycotting Chr istmas gift 
giving or by even boycotting 
the chicken industry. 

" You do that and I can see 
the whole poultry industry

With Col Sanders leading the 
way "

In Support of Legal 

Lt\id F or Students 
by Paul Kaufman, A.S. Prc&idcnl 

Should the entire student body pick up the legal costs if an 
Individual student IS arrested? You will have a chance to 
decide this question in the upcommg AS referendum. to be held 
March 1·3 IWednesday through Friday ). and March 6 and 7 
(Monday and Tuesday I The AS budget IS S84.000 per year : the 
ft rst question asks whether $5,000 01 that should be used for 
lega l aid to students (no new fees are Involved) 

1) Do your favor the use of 51 out of each student's 
existing AS fee to prov ide any AS member ar res led 
(through Sept. 1, 1972 ) with legal serv ices inc luding but 
not limited to : 

Identif ication card with inst r uct ions and 
emergency telephone number . 

- 24·hr . telephone response serv ice 
- On file ba il release informat ion 
- Assistance for " own recogn izance" (OR ) release 

fr om ia il. 
- One free off ice vis it with practicing San Diego 

cromi nal alwyer 
2) Do you favor Registrat ion Feefund ing for the above 

program after Sept . 1, 1972? (Note : Regi strat ion Fee 
mon ies lor Ihis academ ic year have been a ll ocated . ) 

3 ) Do you favor the estab li shment of a ba il lund on 
campus to release students he ld withou t " OR " 
release? (With the money for the lund to come from 
contr ibutions and benef its . ) 

There can be little doubt that at least some students will need 
to make use of legal services As the population of the campus 
community expands tas well as areas of o(fcampus student 
residence J, and with a public pol ice fo rce that IS expanding at a 
proportionate rate, it is almost ax iomahc that mteractlon 
friction and arrests WIll all increase as well . In the US 
generall y. a cihzen is confronted with a complex system of 
law. and in addition to the federal. state . county and city web of 
co-applicable statutes. regulatIOns. and ordmances. a 
unive rsi ty student is also subject to the JUrisd ictIOn of 
untversity rules and procedures. Moreover , many segment of 
the commumty have hi storically been the subjects of unequal 
Jushce minorities ha ve and continue to be harassed on the 
baS IS of their skm color . political activists are sing led ou t 
because o( their politics : the poor suffer in a system of justice 
that requires money: and young people in general find that 
thei r philosophica l commitments and concern about morahty. 
drugs. the draft and other public Issues lead to conflict with th 
law ~ow. 18 year old majority laws give college students even 
more exposure to possible legal consequences. 

Other communities have begun to respond Even the Federal 
Government has begun to fun d legal programs : crlsis·onented 
legal chn ics have been estabhshed. prtvate. nonprofit groups 
have organized their own lega l services : and there is a brow 109 
trend to institute group legal services along the lines of health 
Insurance. 

Does The Need Exist At UCSD? 
Do students ge t arres ted? Do students need le~al counsel' Can 
the majon ty of stude nts pay fo r a legal defense? Statistics 
emphatically docu ment that students are routinely detamed 
and arrested on d ru~·relatcd offenses. petty theft. as ault. and 
even traffiC tickets I an unpaid traffiC ticket I ' a legal excuse 
for throw 109 you 10 jall l - and not merely a few students per

The student government here at UCSD ;~ in desperate need 
of reform and revi talization. Th present AS governm nt 
wastes thousands of student dollars each year. Over $27 .000 of 
the S84,OOO AS budget thiS yea r will be spent on the salafles of 
the giant AS bureaucracy , secretaries. coord lOa tors student 

' (Icers, accountants and so on. At least another S7 .000 Will be 
lent on admimstrahve costs postage. paper. supplies. travel 
xpenses. long distance phone bills. and the like ThiS

40 per cent of the AS budgetJ has little Interest 10 servm~ the

Remove Waste·Save Good Project 
The proble m i how to reduce the amount of money wa ted 

on salaries. bureaucracy, and travel expenses. Let's look "t 
two AS actlvltles as examples. First IS the Coast Cruiser, the 
commuter bus runnm~ to Del Mar . Thi project IS a chromc 
money loser : over the last two quarters. ItS expenses have run 
to 53994 Imcludmg $2278 for salartes I. while Its mcome from 
fa res has been only SI062 1 The S2932 tn los have been paid 
for by-you Second. let 's look at the Ffldav and Saturdav ntght 
film sert~s . an activity the AS supervises. This acl1vit~· had 
expenses of $6726 last quarter. With an mcome o( $6188 10 
mcome from admiSSions. Notice that almost the entire cost 01 
the movie series is paid for by Itself ThiS IS because the films 
erve a wide range of students The bus. on the other hand . 
erves very few people and loses money chronlcalh What WI' 

need IS an AS that prOVides services the students want. and 
With a minimum of costl~ bureaucrats and paper·shuffllng 

A Pos ible Solution 
The problem reduces to thi s the AS has so much mone\' It 

can afford to waste it on money·lo 109 projects and

student to choose which AS services he Wished to use If the AS 
adopted a policy of voluntary membership. each student could

become a member Students would be encouraged to JOin the

"A Message To The Grassroots" by Malcolm X 
Edited \\ith a preface b~ ' like and Sharon lIanc~' 

Pan III 
We ar ! presenting tbis message from 

Malcolm ' 0 the readers of tbe TRITO TIMES 
in tbe bopes of broadening tbe understanding of 
tbe black man's burden in America and all over 
tbe world It is an off-tbe-(!uff cbat, not to be 
scrutinized for grammatical perfection, nor to 
be taken as an altemptto widen tbe gap between 
black and wbite, but ratber to be read witb 
intellectual curiosity and empathy, It is furtber 
hoped tbat you members of tbe majority can see 
tbe pligbt of tbe minority and provoke 
yourselves sometime in your lives to pay Abe 
Lincoln's debt of forty acres and two mules ; we 
also bope tbat the members of the minority will 
cease to be a manifestation of "a house divided 
. , , caonot stand," So read along witb us for tbe 
next few issues and get mad, laugh, or cry, but 
foremost , , . THINK and FEEL. 

On Tbe Differeace Between 
A House Negro and a Field egro 

To understand this yOIl h~ve to 1:0 back to 
what the young brother here referred to as the 
house Negro and Ihe held 'egro back dunng

near their master , and they loved their master 
more than the master hived himself. Thel'

As more and more students are caught up In the cnmlnal 
Justice system, the Immediate need for lawyers, help In 
obtaining ball. and money for legal defense becomes more 
pressmg Most students do not qualify for court-apPOInted 
counsel. Nor can they afford to obtain counsel for an extended 
Criminal defense Justice costs money and the pnor clllzen IS 
gUilty unlil proven mnocent. 

Yet freedom presupposes economic ecurtll', If It IS your 
right 10 think hve and act freely, If n IS your right to be 
assumed "innocent unlil proven gUlltv" In protection of vour 
freedom then It IS your rigbt to have acce to the iegal 
services which alone can promote equahtv of Juslice But with 
ever\' right IS a correpondlng obhgatlon Because onll' the

let 's escape, let's separate," That house egro 
would look at you and say, "Man, you crazl" 

What you mean , separate? Where IS there a 
better house than this? Where can I wear better 
clothes than these? Where can I eat better food 
than this? That was that house Negro! In those 
days he was called a house nigger' And that's 
what we call them today. 'cause we slill got 
som house niggers runmn ' around here 

This modern house Negro loves his master , 
lie wants to ltve near him , He Will pay three 
limes a much as the house i worth , just to live 
near hi s mast r: and then brag about. ' 'I'm the 
only Negro out here , I'm the only one on my' 

job : I'm the only one In this school. " you nothm' 
but a house Negro! And If someone ca me to you 
right now and say, " let's separate," you say the 
same thing that the house Negro said on the 
plantatIon , " What you mean separate? From 

America? This good white man? Where you 
gOing to get a better job than you get here?" I 
mean this IS what you say, " I am 't left nothmg 
m Africa ," that 's what you say - why, vou left 
your mind in Afrtca!' , ., 

On that same plantation, there was the field 
Negro. The field Negro, those were the masses, 
There was always more Negroes in the field 
than there were Negroes in the house. The 
Negro in the field caught hell : he ate leftovers 
Tn the hou e, they ate high up on the hog: the 

Negro in the field didn 't gel nothm ' but what 
was left of the InSides of the hog, They' call them 
chitterlings nowadays : m those davs they called 
them what they were - guts , That's what YOU 
were, a gut eater, and some of )'ou are stili gut 
eatel'S, The field egro was beaten from 

mormng 'till mght. He llved In a shack, wore 
cast off clothes , and h(' hated hiS master I sal 
he hated his master, He was mtei llgent. That 
house Negro ' ioved hi master , but that field 

egro, remember , they were In the maJority , 
and they hated their master When that house 

caught on fire, he didn 't ru h to put it out. h 
prayed for a wmd , When the master got Sick, 
that field Negro prayed that he died If someone 
came to the field egro and said, "let's 
separate, let's run ," he didn 't say where we 
goin ', he said "anvplace is better than here" 

You got field Negroes In America today I'm 
a field Negro , The masses are the field Negroes , 
When they see thl man 's "house ' on fire vou 
don 't here these later egroes talkin ' about 
"our government I m trouble," they say, "the 
government is m trouble " Imagine a Negro -
our government ' I even heard one sal' "our 
astronauts" They won 't even let him near the 
Cape, and "our astronauts : our NavI'," That's a 
Negro that 's out of his mind , '

"Wfio', Afraid of 
Kathleen Woodward VirqiniC\ Woolf?" 

It IS 10 years Ince Edward 
Al bee s· bri ll ia nt a nd 
exhausting play. Wbo's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf? won the 
Drama Cntlcs' Circle Award 
and was. In a classic case of 
pUri tanical short,slghtedness. 
refused nomination for a 
Puli tzer PrIZe . At the 
beginning of a nother decade we 
can now s e that Virginia 
Woolf IS the best play to come 
out of the American sixties 

It IS as as elegantly 
constructed as Ibsen 's Gbosts. 
and Its language IS striking. 
poelic In parts and revIving the 
art of Insult in other parts It 
reveals the hYPOCrISies of our 
social Institutions (marnage. 
the academiC community J and 
exposes the depth of our needs 
and fears . by ripping away th.e 
IlluSions and the ironv we use 
to cover ourselves. . 

It tells of the sixlies. when 
there was a call for activism on 
college campuses. just waking 
up from the placid fifties . And 
rather than Immoral. as some 
have charged . in its seanng 
sadistic comedv of fun and 

.. II1L'l>- Getting the Guests " 
and 'Humping the Hostess " -
It is ultimately. and profoundlv 
moral 

The Off Broadway Theatre In 
downlown San ' Diego is 
currt ntly offering an 
Impre ;sive production of this 
dome! tiC drama about two 
faculu couples having a late 
evenu g party It is directed 
sklllfdiv by Asaad Kelada , a 
gradu.te 'of Y::!c '! nr~ma 
schoel who will direct 
Rosercrantz and Guildenstern 
Are ]lead for th Old Globe 
later IhlS spring 

Cast of Four 
Thl cast of four IS 

profe:.slonal and first-rate . 
Carl Betz plays Georgp. a 
history professor at a minor 
New England college. Betz 
conveys George 's quick . 

Inqulflng mind and hidden 
angUish well . although I think 
George manner should be a 
bit milder and hi Wit a bit 
dner in the beglnmng of the 
play to underline hiS change In 
the second act when he takes 
control of the evening from hiS 
domineering Wife 

Ben Piazza IS Nick . the 
s tuffy . self · rlghteous 
opportunist new to the Biology 
Department He IS married to 
Arlene Golonka . who is 
splendid as Honey, sweet and 
pnssy, SWIlling brandy. and so 
naive that only once does she 
really understand what IS gOing 
on It IS just this moment which 
is one of the acting triumphs of 
the play. When Honey realizes 
that her callous husba nd has 
told George about her 
hystencal pregnancy. her 
excrutiating pain is so real and 
draws such pure sympathy 
from us that we experience at 
that Instant what the play is all 
about : unmasking. narrowing 
distances between peuple . 
senous Involving of ourselves 
in the sad lives of other people. 

Flaw in Martha 
There IS. unfortunately. one 

major disapPOintment in 
casting which flaws the 
production. A modern-day Wife 
of Bath. Martha is age 52. SIX 
years older than her husband 
George . She is lusty . coarse , 
has a fine sense of the 
ridiculous and wears the pants 
in the family . Elizabeth Allen 
gives an . undeniably fine 
pel fVI .. la:1C~ ~. Martha . but 
her very slim figure . youthful 
mid-thirties appearance and 
claSSically fine features create 
a credibility gap that no padded 
bra . grey WI g and raucous 
laughter can overcome . 
Martha thus has a dlscord~nt. 
refined and well-bred air about 
her. and the set (wrongl y I 
think ) reflects this. She calls 
their house a "dump." but we

ee Instead a ta stefully 
decorated. quite tidy liVing 
room 

Virginia Woolf is less about 
marriages based on false 
premises than It is about the 
split in our culture between 
science and the humanities . 
Albee In fact defines the role of 
the responsible Intellectual for 
the Sixties George represent 
the failed Intellectual who. 
though the smartest of them 
all . IS Impotent because he is 
content to adjust himself to 
SituatIOns. to Sit and read his 
books In the corner . to 
meditate, to dissolve all hiS 
anger in irony. Nick . by 
contrast. i a cold. humorless 
pragmalist . a techniCian who 
represents the "wave of the 
future " when science and its 
test tube babies Will reduce 
man to a si ngle model. 

Actioo Requires VioIeoce 

For Albee. " scientist" is a 
dirty word. The core of the play 
is in George 's realizing that 
when things have reached such 
a point of danger , it is not 
enough to contemplate the 
past : he must set out to change 
the future . To be an authentic 
intellectual is to be a man of 
action, and action, Albee 
implies. requires violence. As 
George says, " when you want 
to change something ... you 
BANG ! BANG ! BANG !" 

The Off Broadway Theatre 
offers 'a $1 reduction to 
students. but this is scarcely 
calculated to encourage us or 
increase demand when tickets 
run $5 .50 on the average. I 
would like to see the 
management start a policy of 
selling students tickets at half-
price 15 minutes before 
curtain . Those who agree 
might call th theater to 
suggest they would be 
interested in such a plan. 

Tom Lindberg 
Madness is a sacred human nght. 

but only with certain restrictions; an 
indivldual 's imbalance must weigh in 
favor of the state ... M.N.X .. .. the 
continuing sense adventure of the 
Anomaly Factory, meticulously picks 
apart this inalienable right. laying 
bare its roots and placmg the blame' 
for their implantation in man on his 
larger counterpar t. society . The 
production . which happens every 
Fnday and Saturday night , is a 
Disneyesque fantasy unnervlngly 
twisted into a methodical 
frighteningly bland dream of man 
caught In the net of conformity. and 
this insane regularity IS no longer a 
right but instead an Imposmg 
requirement. 

these memories bring the audience 
into the ring. We are all polished 
products of a social assembly lines, 
knowing the correct responses but 
never the right answers. loving when 
it is safe and always hating , 
celebrating with comic madness and 
casually ubmittlng to the power of a 
dangerous situation. searching for 
meaning in a meaningless circle. 

ObserVing the proceedings 

The correlations are as harsh as 
they are obvious. but. however valid 
the' claim may be, the burden of 
Overman is only a jumping-off point. 
a vehicle for the more mlflhful , 
sensual antics which follow . Once the 
motives are revealed. "M.i\' .X" 
moves onto a technical playing field 
with a mixed bag of striking debates . 
clumsy patomime, flashing lights and 
dancing shadows. and a thunderous 
collage of sound s. classical 
crescendoes. somber piano riffs. and 
an audience participation set with 
bamboo stick perCUSSIOn and 
laughable chanting With this fun the 
fluidity of the statement loses 
mome·ntum . the choppy glimpses of 
Overman at work turned static. each 
scene being a formal ritual of 
madness. but the sum total coming 
off only in I'aguely repetitive style. 

demands a certain amount of 
iniliative: the spectators are led 
through a series of anterooms. 
following the instructions of first a 
self·indulging lab technician and then 
a self·righteous apostle of gloom. 
finally being seated at the center 
ring. The collective doubts of a well-
adju ted audience a re then pulled off 
balance and expanded Into a startling 
account of th e una VOidable 
consequences 01 liVing In a 
mechanized world 

The main attraction IS a parade of 
assembly-line products. the final 
re ult of an unexplained research 
proje ct. the undermind ed. 
overdeveloped Overman . operating 
e fh clentl\' With grad e sc hool 
manners . patterned logiC and 
Inculcated response to set stimuli .

ml ght~ technocratic diety gilded With 
token emotIOns and honored With 
awe-struck fear The proces~ lo n 
awakens memones of merry parties. 
solemn tasks . diligent tud~ Ing. and 
strenuous but patriotic exercise : and 

The unfortunate fat e of Overman 
must not be overemphasized , though . 
and the handling of hiS story IS only a 
secondarv feature of "M. '.X .. The 
Anomall" Factorv deals first With 
excltem·ent. and ' thiS production IS 
Indeed a danng adventure In non-

thiS expenmental group is the real 
center of attractIOn. and that alone IS 
enough to make the show work If you

Tritons get lost in fog, 
I 
lose close one to USIU 

Robert Von Volin 

When the fog finally lifted Wednesday, the 
UCSD soccer greats found themselves on the 
short end of the stick with USIU spiriting away 
a hard-fought 1-0 triumph. It was the first time 
in almost two years that the Booters have been 
shut out. The Tritons had many opportunilJes 
to score. but a lack of experience and 
teamwork frustrated them again and again. 
After the game a UCSD forward remarked 
that it was almost as If " someone up there 
didn't want us to score." 

The lone goal of the match came when a 
USIU forward broke through the Triton 
fullback line and raced one-on-one against 
UCSD goalkeeper Robert Van Valin. Van 
Valin met him at the edge of the penalty area 
and deflected his shot. Center fullback Mark 
Schneider recovered and headed the ball out. 
Another Westerner forward took the ball and 
fi red The goalie was caught out of position , 
and Schneider' valiant effort to save the goal 
fa iled. And that was that. 

The game was played under incredible 
conditions. the fOI! moved m at halftime, and 

from then on one could not see from one end of 
the field to the other. The white-shirted 
Tritons looked like ghosts upon a foggy 
English moor. Obviously thiS caused problems 
as long kicks would suddenly materialize out 
of nowhere followed by several attacking 
forwards. It was quite eerie. 

The Tritons have a great many new players 
thiS spring, and they sl.owed their potential. 
Pony Ma, Paul Kohne , Winston Tssang. Chuck 
Liebow, Manuel Diaz. and John Vicar all 
played well and showed that combined with 
the play of veterans Stewart Hayes, Jorge 
Rivas. Bob Goe, Joel Stemberg. Mike Bridges, 
Oskar Vocal , Schneider, and Van Valin. the 
Tritons have a good chance for a successful 
season and an Improvement over last spring 's 
2-10-2 record . The problem is that now we have 
eleven good soccer players, but they must 
become a team. To create this team is the task 
at hand . 

Tomorrow the Tritons go against 
Southwestern in Chula Vista Next week the 
Kickers go again t the Marines here at UCSD

Eastern influences ; but since 
the Mexican Revolution , 
Mexico has developed a 
genuine literary movement 
mdignous to its land. Mariano 
Azuelas's novel LOS DE 
ABAJO best exemplifies the 
moving away from dominant 
European and Hispanic styles 
nnd genres. 

By the conclusion of his talk , 
Jose Arreola informed MECHA 
of the necessity to produce a 
book of the best literary 
passages in literature that are 
of authentic revelance to the 
Mestizo. It is to be a secular 
Bible. Such a " secular Bible " 
must contain passages from 
the best thinkers, historians. 
poets and novelists. The work 
would serve to nurture a 
positive image of the Mestizo. 
In the past . the Mestizo has 
been looked upon negatively. It 
was not until Jose Vasconcelos 
wrote the book LA RAZA 
COSM ICA that things took a 
postlvie directIOn. 

In the question and answer 
period, a MECHA member 
asked for a comment on the 
theory advance by Salvador de 
Madariega that Cortez was the 
father of Mexico whil e 
:\loctezuma was the mother 

The student further noted that 
the internationally known poet 
Octa vio Paz, in a theoretical 
work titled POSDATA had 
reinstated Cauthemoc as the 
true inheritor of the Mexican 
nation and Moctezuma was 
seen as traitor. The writer and 
critic answered that he 
personally knew Madariaga 
and considered him as slightly 
unsound, According to Arreola, 
the majority of spanish writers 
and poets recogni ze the 
uniqu ness of Mexico and its 
inherent right to redefine its 
historical cultural character. 

Among other matters , 
MECHA was given a report by 
the Chicano Studie s 
Committee, The committee is 
involved in seeing thaI the 
Chicano contribution to the 
Southwest become part of the 
UCSD curriculum . Members of 
the committee meet every 
Monday at 5 p.m . in 250 
Mathews Campus. 

Ricardo Lopez, a doctorate in 
sociology and psychology, will 
lecture on psyc hological 
attitudes of the Chicano. 
MECHA will meet with him 
next Tuesday at 2 p.m . in 412 
Matthews. All persons of 
Mexican descent are invited to 
attend . 

ME CHA meets every 
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m . in the
