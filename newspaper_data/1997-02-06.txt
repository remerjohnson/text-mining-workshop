Chancellor's Advisory Committee Stages 
Forum Discussion on Sexuality Issues 
AWARENESS: Speakers talk 
about diversity and the history of 
the homosexual movement 
By Megan Klein 
Senior Staff Writer 

Approximatcly 20 pcople gathered at the 
Women 's Ccnteron Tuesday night for a di vcrsi ty-
awareness lecture ponsorcd by the UCS D 
Chancellor's Adv isory Committee on Lesbian, 
Gay and Transgendered Issues. 

The lecture featured gue~t speakers from the 
Lcsblan, Gay and Bisexual Bureau - an organi-
zation that makes presentations to univcr~ity 
classes, dorms, religious group~ and other organi-
lations. 

PrevlOu~ly , the bureau ha provided sensitivity 
training to the UCSD Pollee Department and has 
paired up for di CUSSlons with thc ros ultural 

Center. 
Speakers Robert Nguyen, Howard Finnecy, 

Ri ch Belmontcz, Sarah Archibald, Gabriella Tako 
and Jenny Pournelle gave short presentations about 
homos xuality , attempting to dispcl tercotypes 
and inform the audience about the history of gays 
and Ie bian , as well as trcnds in the gay, lesbian, 
and bisexual movements. 

Finnecy, a former employee at Transportation 
and Parking Scrvice , gave a lecture addressing 
what he feels is society'S growing acceptance of 
homosexuality . 

Accordlllg to Finnecy, the media - particu-
larly television - have historicall y portrayed 
homoscxuab as the target of joke~ . However, 
si nce the 1970s, homosexuality has becn treated 
in a positive manner. 

Finnecy also discu sed the attitude of hl~ uni -
ver~i ty co-worker~ toward him a~ an unclosctcd

'The undergrad can learn to pre-

The number of sys temwide out-

Alt hough the overall number o f

while the numbcrof ative Ameri -

3.!l percent. Chicano applicati on~ 
sunk 0.9 percent. and applicati ons

Applications from Asia n -

the number of students who Ii led

percent. 

Dcnni~ Galligani , assistant vice 
president for student academi<: ser-
vices, said any number of reasons 
could be behind the drop. 

"Student choice is influenced 
by a complex sct of interactive fac-
tors," Ga lligani said. " Not all o f 

t hem are readi Iy apparem and quan-
tifiahle ." 

Galligani panial ly al1ributed 
the drop in minority applications 
to aggress ive marketing elTorls

UC Must Continue to Fight 
Against Affirmative Action 

Visionary politi ca l leadership is not a tra it that most 
Ca lifornians (let a lo ne universi ty stude nts) would read il y 
a ttribute to the C Board of Regents. Ye t, in light of the 
impact that actions taken by the board have had on the 
affirmative-act ion debate during the past two years , one 
can not he lp but admi t that the work of Regent Ward 

on nerly went a long way toward innuenc ing the out-
come of las t November 's referendum on Proposition 209. 

It was in Jul y of 1995 that the n:gents nearly single-
handedly spawned a national debate on the merit s of 
race- and gender-preference program~ with the ir passage 
of resolutions 51'- 1 and SP-2, 

SP- I re~ol ved that the ni er~ it y of alifornia , beg in -
ning with the 1998-99 schoo l year, would no longer con-
s ider race or gender c riteri a in admi ss ion to any U cal11-

pu~ or program, SP-2 provided that the uni versity wou ld 
no lunger pur~ue hiring or con tracting programs that 
favored those of certain races r genders . 

However, proponents of affirmative action are deter-
mined not to let the issue die , A prime example is a 
recent complaint filed by the Mex ican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund (MALD EF) and the 
National Associati on for the Advancement of Co lored 
People (NAACP) with the Office of Federal Contract 

ompli,mce Programs , 
These groups allege that the U ,as the beneficiary of 

some $1.3 bi Ilion in rederal contracts per year, is in vio-
lation of rules guverning federa l contrac tors becausl! o f 
the SP- I pol icy, They argue that because many U grad-
uate and professiona l stude nt ~ go on to become employ-
ees of the un ivers it y. a nd because the UC will a llegedly 
not be drawing from a diverse enough pool of applicants 
a ft er the implementatiun of SP- I, the UC workforce will 
not be di verse enoug h to be digiblc for federal co ntracts . 

The MALDEF/ AA P argument is absurd , As long 
as the U c omplies with feeleral diversity guiddi nes, it 
doesn' t matt l!r who the U h ires, or where th ey gl!t their 
educa ti on. If the U complies wi th federal rules , SP- I 
will not jcopardi-lc funding. 

Morl!uver, as Dl:puty General Cou nsel Gary 
Morrison correctl y poin ts out. SP- I contai ns language 
tha t would nullify the anti -arfirm ati ve action measure if 
the federal governme nt were to rule that the measure 
jeopardized fedl!ral funds . 

However. the time will come when the UC will have 
to s tand up to the federal government on the issue of 
affirmative acti on. The regents will have to decide 
whether to keep federal contracts by unfairly discriminat -
ing o n thl! bases uf race and ge nder, or whether to have a 
fai r system that is ineligible for fede ral money. Ir the fed -
era l governme nt offe rs such an ultimatum , the UC should 
do the right thing and s tand up for equa l opportunity. 

It is unfortunate that the UC is so depe ndent on feder-
al mo ney, But if the regen ts arc serious about abandoning 
the race- and gender-based spo i Is system that is now in 
place, they need to think about what's go in g to happen 
when the federal government threatens to hit the m where 
it really hurts - in the pocketbook , 

Thumbs Up to UCAB for extending 
Espresso Roma 's hours until 1 a.m , 

It 's only one extra hour a day. but it 's a giant step in 
the right direction for UCSD. Extended hours at food 
vendors, pubs and s tudy lounges arc convenient for stu-
dents who work late into the ni g ht. Tht! nivt!rsity 
Centers Advi sory Board sh uld keep up the good work 
in making thi s campus more user-friendly.

BUDGET AMENDMENT WILL 
PUT KEYNES .IN HIS PLACE 

COMMENTARY: Wi th the passage of a balanced-budget amendment, 
old economic theory will give way to a new era of fiscal responsibility 

Unlike Brent Johnson, whose 
column appeared in this space last 
week, I don ' t read daily newspa-
per columns, In fact , I read only a 
very small fraction of our local 
dai Iy newspaper, the UI/io/l · 
Triblllle. 

John Maynard Keynes, who argued that recessions are 
the products of insufficient aggregate demand that can 
be remedied by government spending binge, financed 
by borrowing. 

Nat e I find most news ani c le~ - he 

In fact, Keynesian economic theory postulates that if 
government were to ~u t back on spending during reces-
sions because of decreased tax rcvenue~, run-or-the-
mill recessions would tum into runaway depressions ,

Ihal some polimian or another will

hcfore long. 

Because Repuhli can leaders in 
Congres~ wi ll fa~e stilT opposition

amendment up for a vote in the 
coming weeks, It was wi th great 
interesl that t read resident liberal 
Jim Goldsborough's art ick on the 
legislation in Monday" U"ion · 
Tribllne. I wasn't disappointed, 
Goldsborough's arguments arc so 
bad that I'll bel my bottum dollar 
that wc'lI hear President Clinton 

For every dollar that 
government spends, 
it uses up 
productive economic 
resources -
resources that could 
have been used by 
people who would 
have put them to 
good use. By and 
large, government 
spends money on 
things people 
wouldn't pay for 
themselves. 

a balanced-budget amendment 
would hc a "threat to our economic 
health , wi II expose our economy to 
unacceptable risks and would scri -
ously increase the risk of default on 
national deb!." 

A classic Keynesian argument. 
II's too bad that it doesn't hold 
water. Some pointed questions for 
the discip les of Keyncs: 

I) Suppose that a rel:ession hi ts 
and thc tax base shrinks by 10 per-
cent, say $ 160 bi llion. Let us stipu-
late that it is definitely not advis-
ab le to raise taxes during u reces· 
sion. The government has two 
other options: cut spending or bor-
row money. (II's really too bad that 
we don't have a national savings 
account for rainy-day con tingen-
cies such as these.) Suppose we cut 
spending by $160 billion. Is it rea-
sonable to suppose that this is 
going to make a real diffcrence 
betwcen recession and depression 
in a $6 tri Il ion economy'! 

2) Suppose we borrowed the 
$160 billion, How much closer lo 
recovery is a $6 trillion economy ir 
government continues spending 
this amount '! 

3) Suppose we were in a depres-
sion. (Forgct the fact that many 
economi sts believe that this is 

saying Ihe same things before long. 
It 's quite easy [0 ee why liberal don't like a bal-

anced-budget amendment . Such an amendment would 
have precluded Franklin Rooseve lt from gelling his 
New Deal legislation passed in the 1930s. Roosevelt 's 
economic program rested on the idea~ of econOlnist 

impossible given what we now 
know about monetary policy and given Lhe eKistence 
of well -functioning global capital market .) Woul,," ' t

The attitude of adminislrators 
and bureaucrats toward the siudent 
body is increasi ngly becoming one 
of apat hy ,lnd contempt, widening 
the gap between students and siaff. 
We can not hclp hU I fcc I that 
adminislrators regard us as nui-
sances that must be loleratcd for 
the sake of a job. Have they com· 
pletely forgottcn thai withoul stu-
dents there is no uill versity? 

During my first quarter of high· 
er educati on, I noticed many i nci -
denls that demonslrate the admin· 
istnJlion 's lendency to care more 

ahout poli cy and guidelines than 
\ llIdenb ' nl'cd,. A rew examples: 

• Sel: 1I0nS ;lre ;ldmini strati vely

• Sume laff members arc

you, and I quote: "The offi ce d os-
es at 4:30, and it is now 4 :3 1." 

• There IS a IOlal lack of ,om·

traveling to 15 uillerent places on

locate the exact place where they 
l:an accomplish a 30-sccond task . 

• Somc oftkes havc rude tele-
phone procedures. I once called for 
an office location and was put on 
hold no Ie s than four times. 

It is ridil:ulous procedures such 
as these that cause students' 
increasing unhappiness with 
administrator-student relalions at 
all live UCSD colleges. Students 
' hould be ab le to gel timely help 
from administrators, while being

Chacon says, "Our purpose is to

anced-budget amendment don ' t 
rely so much on economics. 
Politicians who have come out 
against the amendment say that it 
poses unacceptable enforcement 
prohlems. In other words, "You 
can' t trust us to obey the 
Constitution, so you shouldn' t pass 
a constitutional amendmeOlthat we 
won ' t enforce. Besides, you don ' t 
want the courts messi ng around 
with the budget, do you?" 

This goes to show just how cyn-
ical politi cians arc about the 
Constitution. It seems that they 
aren't willing to respect it as the 
expressed will of the people unless 
they arc compelled to do so by the 
court~ . However, the courts can' t 
enforce every porti on of the 
Constitution . Indeed, we have seen 
severa l proviSions (such as the 
Second Amendment and the 
Commerce Clause) transmogrify 
hefore our very eyes in the hands of 
the Supremc Court. 

ThiS argument is also interesting 
because it shows that even li bera l ~

our minds, how wi II the gap ever

In the words of Chacon, 'The 
questi on that needs to he an~wered 
is how do we change th ings and 
make a dilTcrence'! We can look at 
II , compla in abou t it and accept it, 
or we can changl! it. " 

It truly IS for the people, the stu-
dents, 10 decide. 

The UCSD Guardian 

It's quite easy to 
see why liberals 
don't like a 
balanced-budget 
amendment. Such 
an amendment 
would have 
precluded Franklin 
Roosevelt from 
getting his New Deal 
legislation passed in 
the 1930s. 
understand how the federal court 
sy~tem (a system over which they 
exert a disproportionate amount of 
control) is nowadays institutionall y 
incapable of exercising any kind of 
restraint. Of course, judges will be 
wi lling 10 hear lawsuits brought by 
one fringe group or another against 

provis ion~ of the budgetthcy don't 
like. The essence of 20th century 

Ameri can jurisprudence is the 
gradual encroachment of the judi-
ciary upon powers properly dele-
gated to the executi ve and legisla-
tive branches. 

But thc courts can' t go on like 
thi s forever. Beside~, Congress 
would sooner disband forever than 
hand over control of the purse 
strings 10 the judiciary. The most 
plausible scenario is that Congress 
will obey the amendment while 
simultaneously ignoring any 
attempts by the courts to meddle 
with the budget. 

Goldsborough also attacks thc 
amendment 's provision all owi ng 
Congress to engage in defici t spend-
ing with a three-fifths vote, even in 
times of peace, as unprinci pled. 

"Should we al low 60 senators to 
decide that freedom of the press 
shall ex ist onl y, say, 10 percent of 
the time?" he fumes. 

Clearly, th is hypotheti cal provi-
~ion would be absurd . But the 
Consti tution already provides that a 
two-thirds vote of Congress shall 

Thursday, February 6, 1997 

override a presidential veto. Should 
we allow a presidential veto to be 
overridden by Congress? 
Reasonab le minds may differ on 
this question, but nevertheless the 
answer is wrillen into the 
Constitution. But you won't hear 
liberals allacking thi s provision as 
being unprincipled. 

Goldsborough was right when 
he sai d that " with a balanced-bud-
get amendme nt , Keynesian eco-
nomics would end up on the scrap 
heap of history." (Isn't it nice thut 
he borrowed the italicized phrase 
from the great anti -Key nesian 
Ronald Reagan'!) 

The balanced-budget amend-
ment will put an end to irresponsi-
ble federal pending. It will play an 
important role in reducing the size 
and scope of government. In many 
ways, it represents a mortal blow tu 
big-government liberali sm. For 
these reasons , future historians 
might regard the passage of' this 
amcndmen t as the finest hour of the 
I 05 th Congress.

Ri ch Belmonlel and Jenny

being gay in the U.S. military . 
Belmontez, formerly in the Navy, 
exami ned policies that have excluded 
homosexuals from thc military. 

According to Belmontez, homo-
sexuality was first classified as a 
mental illness in 1943. When re-
ports to thc contrary were publishcd 
in 1957, it was thcn con idered a

Sarah Archibald di scussed the 
potential for extending spousal ben-
efi ts to domestic partners of univer-

would include the right to child-

access to on-campus faci lities, while 
" hard " benefi ts would extend hea lth '

"Education and information are 
the most important things,"

One Women's Center staff mem-
ber who attended the meeting said 
presentations by different gender, 
race and ethnicity groups on cam-
pus are necessary to make people 
more aware of the history of issues 
such homosexuality. 

Audience member Kathi Smith 
said she found the lecture to be in-
formative and interesting. 

" I came hecause a fri end was on 
the panel, and because ofhirn I have 
become much more aware of the

be great iflthere were more] discus-
sions like Ihese."

renders 

flashier, sexier 
production of 

Moliere classic 

Graduate production s at UCSO have a hi story of ~dapting traditional . plays mto contemporary circum-
stances. The UC 0 Theatre Graduate 
Oepartment 's adaptati on of 17th-centu-
ry French playwright M o liere's HDon 
Juan" is no exception. 

Translated by playwright Richard 
Nelson and directed by Michael 
Schwartz, the production 's comed ic, 
incredible set and beautiful costumes 
f<Jilto c<Jrry thi s show past its imperfec-
tions. A combination of directing and 
tex tual translation choices prove insuffi-
cient, which unfortunately loses the pro-
duction's focus - and by the end, its 
audience. 

Sexy, sinful and sa lac iou s, thi s 
remake starts off as a clever romp into 
the life of playboy Don Juan :Tenorio, 
portrayed in an appropriate ly arrogant 
fashion by the studly Jacques Smilh. 
Lying somewhere betwee n "Singled 
Out" and "UCSO Presents the Chippen-
dales Dancers," this production allows 
the audicnce 10 lau gh a little and have a 
bit of fun . 

Equipped with a 9lX-like sound-
track , cos tumes straight out of 
" Swingers" and countless verbal pop-
cullure allusions, UCSO's "Don Juan" 
takes its quirks a little too far, bordering 
on a didactic "voice-of-a-generation " 
tone. 

These references and allusions di~ ­
tract from the overall production . The 
" Phanlom of the Opera" reference, 
which opens the second act, sets a mild-
ly di sappointing tone. Moliere also turns 
sharply morali stic and deep at this point 
in the original text , for which neither the 
director nor cast is to be faulted. Never-

th ele~s , something i s lo!> t in Richard 
Nelson 's translation and thc subsequent 
introduction of contemporary theme~.

Northern Ca lifornia 's East Bay

there arc al way, exception, to 
e very norm . Dead and Gone, 
whose latest release, God Loves 
Eve lTolI 1! 8111 Ylm, merely seems to 
rehash hackneyed, overd ne musi-
cal genre, composed of hate-driven 
lyrics and speedy guitar nffage.

particularly original or profound. In 
the punk tradlllon, Dead and Gone 
concentrate more on the overall feel

to one of the pre~eding decades ' be~t 
legaCIes. Violent \Vorld allelllpt, to 

capture the Misfits' dark sound and 
twist it with some hardcore, punk 
and metal innuences. A few of the 
bands even successfully interpret the 
Misfits. 

Pennywise - a punk band with 
more obvious Misfits innuenees -
cover "Astro Zombies," but fail to 
make it sound different from the 
original. Farside (not to be mi staken 
with the hip-hop group, The Phar-
cyde) does an impressive t:over of 
"Return of the Fly." Tanner's cover 
or "T. V. Casualties" rocks as hard 
as any or its own songs . A Tanner 
ran unfam iliar with th e Misfits 
might never realilc it was a cover. 

Sick of it AII \ cover of "AII Hell 
Brcab Loosc" unsurprislIlgly

den plot - even more dry and 
insipid than its pretext - takes 
place in the parking lot of an all -
flight convenience store run by an 
aggravated (who wouldn't bc '!) 

Pakistani couple . 
The storyline forms 

around the posh am val 
or a fonner suburbanite -
gone-talent less rock star, 
Pony (Jayce Bartok) -
accompanied by a limou -
sine and his publicist, 
Erica (Parker Pusey). 
Jealousy follows, and so 

th l! story goes.. . absolutely 
nowhl!re. 

The IiIm is abo dragged out hy 
the weak pcriormalll:e, hy Giovan-
ni Rihi si, who plays Icading- Iosa 
Jeff (and hear, a rather dislUrhing 
resc lllhlancc to l3illic Joe from 

Green Day); Amie Carey, who 
plays Soole, Jeff's equall y "cheelY 
punk" girlfriend) and their circle of 
annoyi ng friends. 

The fai lure of these characters 
to represent their generation's val -
ues and achieveme nts also signi -
fies a grave misconception, on the 
part or Li nklater and Bogosian. 

Beyond anything, the audience 
(at least at this particular screen-
ing of "subUrbia") leaves the the-
ater with an infectious desire to 
gi ve these dorks a swift kick in 
the as .

Continued from page 9 
renderc<.l anti-climaclil; and dichc. 

While Ihe danl;ers were enter-
laining, their obvious lalent is wasl-
cd on a gratuilous display of skin, 
serving no purpose 10 the aClual 
scripi and inlerpretalion Ihereof. 
Portrayi ng Don Juan 's adoring 
muses in one brief scene, their con-
stant reappearance in between 
scenes (sans Juan) transforms them 
from talented entertainers 10 Irite, 
I ilillaling objects. 

The Mandell-Weiss Forum Slu-
dio is, of course, a mere black box. 
Fortunately, the produclion ~lafT 

was bbsed wilh the lalent of sel-
designer V. Nadja Lancelol, whose 
work was fealured in last quarter's 
produl.:lion of Chekov's "The Seag-
ull." Moslly ulililarian, Ihe "Don 
Juan" sci allows varied and inter-
eSling space for movemenl, which 
is al times under-ulilized by Ihe 
director. 

Consequently, the produc tion 
relies on the strength of the set, the 
shock and style' of the cosluming 
(i.e. Juan's silver g-string undies), 
and the immediacy of the allusions 
associaled to Richard Nelson's 
conlemporary Irans lation of 
Moliere's lexl, rather Ihan sirong, 
balanced acling and directing. 

For Ihe mosl part, Ihe audience

Thursday, February 6, 1997 The UCSD Guardian 

exam Ie, on and off the court 
ou've secn him walking 

around school. 
He 's li sted officially al 

6-fool-8 and 230 pounds, 
but he seems much bigger. 
His name is Matt Aune, and 
for the last four years he 

has been UCSD's post punisher, an 
immovable object who has been 
terrorizing the best of Di vision III 
since hi s freshman ye'lr. 

"Whal sels Aunc apart is that 
he's so big. We call him ' Bear' 
because he's so huge." teanltnal l! 
Cole Miller said. "Bul hc 's also so 
agile. he has such good lOuch and 
gr<:al knowledge of th<: galll<:.' · 

Aunc has heen pUlling hi s skill, 
on disp lay for some I i me now. 
Afler high school , he wanled 10 go 
10 a UC school. Though hI! had 
oIlers from Di vision II schoob, 
including UC Davi" which i, ncar 
1m homl!lOwn of Santa Ro\.l, he 
I:hose Ihc weather and Ihe a, SUI -
anl:e of playing limc in San Diego. 

All Ihal he has done sinl;e Ihen 
is assaull Ihe UCSD record books 
with a vengeanl;e, ranking second 
all-limc in both lOla I poims and 
rehounds. and averaging 17.5 
poinls per game and 9.7 rebounds. 

He ranks among: the ali -lime lOp 
five players in 17 different cate-
gories al UCSD while nOlching 45 
career double-double,. 

Never satisfied wilh hi s perfor-
mance, Aune has continued to 
improve hi s game. This sea,on he 
is averaging 25.9 poinls and 12.2 
rehou nds per game and shooling 
60.6 pl!rcenl from the noor -
numbers Ihal rank him firsl In the 
We,lern Region. His current scor-
ing average ranks him fourlh 

nati nally and he is eighth in the 
nation in rebounding. 

Obviously, he is a strong AII-
American candidate. and will like-
ly win hi s Ihird I.:onseculive te'lI11 
MVP award , 

") don 'l really look al any per-
sonal goals," the modest Aune said . 
"Obviously I want to be a good 
scorer. This season I've been work-
ing on rebounding and that's 
improved. Olherwise. I'm just try-
ing to pass il out ide for shOls." 

He ha, been a tenaciou, 
rehounder for a team with only IWO 
truc post players. He ripped down 
20 hoards againsl Cal LUlheran car-
Iier Ihi s season. and in hi s carcl!r he 
has led Ihe Trilons in rebounding 
for an amazing 74 games, making 
111m a real anchor In Ihe middle. 

"Since I'vc been al thi s Icvl!! 
playing and I;oaching, I haven ' l 
,een a player wilh Mall's ,il.c and 
agiliI Y. " Trilon Assistllnt Coach 
Chris Christensen said. "There are 
guys his size thai can'l move with 
him. There arc guys smaller Ihan 
him ami he jusl overpower, lhem. 
That's been hi s major advanlag<: as 
far as baskelball at Ihis level." 

Though he has a good shooling 
touch, Aune knows where his bread 
i, buttered . Panicularly Ihis season, 
he has been establishing himself in 
the post and shooting most of hi s 
shots within five feet of the basket. 
which only helps numbers such liS 
hi s fi eld-goal percenlage. The Belir 
has certainly benefited from Ihe 
system of Head Coach Greg 
Lllnlhier. which as Trilon fans 
know, is wide op<:n. 

Since UCSD has a group of 
exeellenl oUlside shooters. defend-

ers are at risk to double-Ieam Aune 
inside. When he docs draw a 
crowd, Aune has proven more than 
capable of dropping a dime 10 his 
teammates. This relalionship 
makes for a high-octane offense 
and is responsible for much of Ihe 
leam's success. 

"His size and hi s knowledge 
make the difference," guard Dan 
Almquisl said. "He's been playing 
college baskelball for four years ... 
so he knows when to kick it out and 
when to shool il." 

"Thi~ year, and somcti mes la. t 
year, we got the chemislry working 
well , moving the ball inside and 
OUI." Aune said . "Ii look a while 10 
HdJuSI 10 Coach Lanlhler';, ~ysl cm . 

"Kighl now I jU~1 wan t Ihe I.: a 111 
to do well. If we don ' t make Ihe 
playoffs, I'll be disappoinled. bUI 
il's been a fun year. We ' ve compel-
cd in every game." 

Wilh live games left , the Tritons 
cannot afford a loss, and Ihey will 
be looking 10 Aunc. a senior and 
Ihe only player wtlh poslseason 
experience. 10 carry the load, 

Whelher or nOI Ihe team makes 
the playoffs, Aune should be play-
ing baskelball in Ihe future, hope-
fully ill Ihe professional leve l in 
<:ithcr Auslr~lia or Europe. He cer-
lainly has Ihe size for it, and a pos-
itive attilude to match. 

'"The besl thing about Matt is 
that every guy on Ihe team likes 
him, looks up to him," Christensen 
said. "So when you have your lead-
ing scorer who is also the guy that 's 
most well -liked on the team, bolh 
those qualittes make him Ihe best 
player on our team thi s year by 
far."

beller than spending a weekend at 

an ultimatc-disc tournament, pref-

when the UCSD ultimale contin-

with a bang. 

And what a better way 10 start the

Squids advanced because of their

Late Turnovers Aid Vanguard Cause 
DROUGHT: Unable to core a bucket in the last three minute of the game, UCSD fell to Southern California College, 66-62 
By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

Joe Namath and the Jet!> did it to the olts 
in Super Bow l III , Evander Holyfield did it to 
Mike Tyson last fall , and more recently the 
Clippers did it to the Lakers. 

While Southern alifornia Collegc's 66-
62 comeback win over the SD women's 
basketball team can hardly be w nsidered an 
upset of such caliber, the pointl~ thi ~ : even the 
he t teams lose. 

Some might not even ca ll thi ~ an upset; 
SCC did have a 13-7 record and they were 
playing at home in the fnendly wnfine~ of the 
Pit. But the 13-3 Tri ton~ had been on a major 
roll ofi ate, winning ~ix 01 their last seven, and 
the last two by a combi ned margin of 79 
points. 

They were beginning to dominate cven the 
very talented team,>, rapidly e,>whl l,hl ng them-
,dve, as one 01 the elite tectlm on the We,t

Thc fact tlhlt the TnlOn\ 10\' I,>n ' t what 

Feb. 4 at sec 

should concern Head Coach Judy Malone; it 
is vi rtually Imposlti ble to have a perfect sea-
son over such a ngoroult schedule. It is the 
way they lost that might cause some concern . 

In the firM half the Tritons played their 
usual brand of ba~ketball , using a balanced 
offense and an aggre'ltlve defen e to build an 
early lead. But the Vanguards also had a good 
firs t half, and did their best to stay 
wi thin ~t nklng distance of the Tri ton 
lead. U SD wuldn ' t ~hake them, and at 
the break the Tritons led by four, 37-33. 

Then came the second half, and de-
~pi te the Tritons' bCltt effort~, the peltky 
Vanguard ' lti mply would not go away. 

Like it or not, the Tritonlt had a real 
game on their hand~ . Thi!> one was go-
ing to be a nall -bller. The winner olthi !> game 
would he the team that wanted It the mmt.

in the top five in the nation - UCSD at No. 2 
and La Verne at No. 5. 

Foreed to playa schedule and a conference 
that is dominated by DiVision I schools, Tri -
ton Head Coach Duncan McFarland and his 
team understood the necessity to play well 
against the Leopards in order to impress the 
se lection committee, which will choose the 
West Coast representative for the playoffs.
