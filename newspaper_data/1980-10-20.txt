In 1978, Burbidge supported -
and Hackerman apposed - a 
decision by the MAS board of 
directors to not meet in states that 
have not ratified the Equal Rights 
Amendment. Burbidge will become the third 

scientist 1rom UCSD to lead the 
organization since 1974. UCSD 
founder Roger Revelle and former 
Chancellor William McElroy both 
served as AAAS presidents during 
that time. 

Burbidge, the director of 
UCSD's Center for Astrophysics 
and Space Science, was elected to 
the prestigious position over 
Norman Hackerman, president of 
Rice University. 

Burbidge is the third woman to 
head the organization in its 122-
year history. She will begin her 
term as president-e1ect early next 
year and assume the organiza-
tion's presidency in 1982, 
sua:eeding Allan Bromley of Yale 
University. 

The first woman president of 
the American Astronomical 
Society in 1976, she led a similar 
move to not meet in non-ERA 
states. 

Burbidge, regarded as one of the 
best observational astronomers in 
the world, is married to UCSD 
professor Geoffrey Burbidge, who 
shares similar distinction in his 
field of theoretical astronomy.

Int'l Center nursery may 
close - too few kids 
BY CARMEUTA ROSAL 

With an enrollment of 
only four children, UCSD's 
International Center Co-op 
Nursery School will be 
forced to close Nov. 15, 
program director Pearl 
Greenfield said Friday. 

"In the last four years," 
Greenfield said, "we 
managed to fill up the 
.program by January, 
starting with (only) ten 
children." 

If ten children are 
registered in the prOlr'am 
the nursery school will 
remain open, but the 
decline in enrollment is 
deterring it from continuing 
its assistance to parents 
with pre-school· aged 
children, according to 
Greenfield. 

At preeent, the nursery 

school's enrollment of four 
children is insufficient 
because the funds for the 
program come from 
enrollment fees laid by 
parents, Greenfiel said. 

"Right now, it's hurting 
(us), and we're even further 
into the hole because we 
have no extra funding. The 
fee that parents ~y is used 
to pay (for) salaries and the 
the school materials, Green-
field said. 

Since they have rent-free 
use of the facility at the 
International Center and 
require parents to donate 
some time to assist the 
school, the fees charaed at 
the nursery school are 
slightly lower for a ''rf4rU1ar 
enrichment" prop-am than 
at a pri'vately owned 
nursery school, ihe uid. 

In an attempt to attract 
more parents to the school, 
Greenfield started an 
afternoon child care 
program from 12 to 4 pm on 
Mondays, Wednesdays and 
Fridays. "At present, the 
four children who have been 
signed up for the morning 
prOlr'am, decided to extend 
through the day.Wehaveno 
new children coming to the 
school to enter this 
afternoon program," 
Greenfield said. 

In order to be eligible for 
the child care program, the 
child must be at least two 
years and nine months to 
five years old. The 
enrollment ' fee for three 
afternoon sessions per week 
is $50 monthly, and the 
three morning sessions cost

SDSP Illetnbers 
get trial date 
after hearing 
Judge says police 
'protect' activists 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
New. EdItor 

Three UCSD San Diego Students for Peace 
members arrested this summer for vehicle code 
violations at an anti-registration rally will face 
trial in San Diego County Municipal Court next 
month. 

At a hearing Friday, Presiding Judge Richard 
Hanscom set a Nov. 24 trial for Mitch Sosna, Ahuva 
Novak and Fred Peck, all cited for various vehicle 
code infractions as they drove around a downtown 
post office demonstation in the SDSP's "anti-draft 
mobile." 

The three SDSP members claim that they were 
followed, harrassed and physically abused as they 
attempted to exercise their constitutional rights of 
free speech by "educating the people" about draft 
registration. 

In issuiDf. his decision, Hanscom told the 
defendants, 'It is necessary for people in (l"der to 
exercise their First Amendment rights, to have 
someone to protect them ... and that's the police." 

"I want to know how them (the police) being 
present there was protecting our First Amendment 
rights," Sosna said after the heari!1i' "That was 
the hole in his top: and he knew it. 

Hanscom indicated that he would not hear the 
case when it aoea to trial next month. 

At the hearing, Hanscom granted 1001 the 16 
"discoveries" requested by the defense concerning 
police 'activities before and during the Aug. 1 
demonstration. 

On that day, Sosna was cited for a number of 
vehicle code violations, including unlawful riding, 
unnecessary use of horn, no side view mirror, no 
front license plates, obstruction of the driver's 
view by a passsenger and obstruction of driver's 
view by a banner. Novak and Peck were cited for 
unlawful riding. 

The yrosecution representing the San Diego 
Police Department must now present the defense 
with all police directives issued on how to handle 
anti-~stration activities, tape recordings of radio

Police crackdown 
Campus police proved just how tough they can be 

last Tuesday when they forcibly removed 25 student 
picketers from inside the lobby of a Mandeville reception 
for Chancellor Richard Atkinson. 

The~ also clearly demonstrated the depths of 
inconSideration and Irrationality they can reach when 
"called to duty." 

It is not their duty to harrass or rough up peaceful 
studet:1t protestors; i~ is especially heinous when police 
act without .any O~VIOUS attempt at peaceful solutions. 

None of five pohce at the protest remember if they 
warned students in advance to leave the reception area. 
Student demonstrators and witnesses that were there 
don't recall a warning either. 

Tru~, the s~udents did .disrupt the a~bienc~ of the 
recept!on, but In no way did their behaVior ment police 
brutality. What happened Tuesday was unjustified and 
alarming. Given the right to enforce both 'real world" 
laws .and university regulations, ca~pus police 
potentially have a great deal of power. Their use of this 
power Tuesday was mis~ided and dangerous. 

Chancellor Atkinson s call for a task force 
invest.iga~ion of ~ur police is a good first step to avoiding 
such mCidents In the future, and Atkinson deserves 
praise for his prompt response. 

We hope, however, that the investigation will go well 
beyond last week's actions of campus police. The task 
force should examine the policies and guidelines that 
campus police must meet to "to do their duty" and serve 
the campus and its students. 

Broken promises? 
Chancellor Atkinson told the Board of Overseers 

Wednesday that he thol!!tht it would be a neat idea to 
create a Department of Engineering. 

Programs and faculty for the new department are 
already here in the EECS and AMES departments. The 
move would be a leap forward for graduates in these 
programs, many of whom have prospective employers 
ask them what an "EECS" is. 

An engineering department sounds like a good idea; 
it is certainly one worth studying. 

But when Atkinson came here last spring, he noted 
that the campus was weakest in the humanities and 
social sciences. He promised to devote substantial effort 
to improving those areas. 

Dissatisfied non·science majors who believe the non· 
science programs and departments here are inadequate 
are one of the reasons this campusd has such a high 
transfer rate. 

Atkinson should spend more of his time, publicly and 
privately, trying to upgrade these deficient areas. .

~-GREAT 1m5 (): 

(letters 
I And yet another response I 
Editor: 

I am rather amused and 
surprised by the vitriolic 
response to my letter to the 
Guardian. I can't imagine 
any UC student writing in 
support of Ronald "Let there 
be a blood bath" Reagan. a 
man who tried so hard to 
destroy this institution. 
Wasn't it Ronny, that grand 
defender of individual ' 
freedom, who wouldn't allow 
one of our professors to 
teach? Didn't our illustrious 
former governor attempt to 
SQuash the "freedom of 
speech" movement by 
sending in his Fascist goons? 
(perhaps Ronny never read 
the first amendment). 

In the first of these letters, 
Michael Schwartz (Daily 
GlUlrdwn. Oct. 15) "What or 
who caused America to begin 
deteriorating?" The answer 
is, of course, a\1 of us. Like so 
many other vo~rs, Mr. 
Schwartz assumes that all of 
our problems are caused by 
the President. Carter is not 
God: he can't solve all of our 
problems. 

May I remind Mr . 
Schwartz that Carter did not 
instigate the draft but rather 
registration for the draft, the 
two are extremely different, 
the next time I see something 
anti·anybody in the GlUlrd· 
illPI, I would hope that at least 
some of the opinions are 
based on fact. 

Indeed the Chancellor (not 
the President, Mr. Schwartz) 
of Germany has contempt for 
Carter, but the entire world 
is laughing at us for even 
considerine Ronald Reagan 
for President. 

I disagree with Mr. 
Schwartz's proposition that 
peace or war is most often 
dictated by our adversaries. 
Our involvement in both 
Vietnam and Korea was not 
dictated by our adversaries 
but by oUnielves. 

I resent Mr. Schwartz's 
attack on Carter's foreign 
policy. The President:s policy 
has shown temperapee and 
reasonabltmesS. Carter has 
exhibited wisdom and 
restraint in dealil1l with the 
Iranian •. : Reagan 1Ir0bably 
would have bad us tiIown to 
hell over that country. The 
Panama cpnaJ treaft was a 
tdumph of American 
diplomacy. Reagaft _ted to 
keep the canal, whiCli would 
have gotten us ip __ a war. 
Also, President Caner has 
made Rreat strides .,.. peace 
in the Middle East. 

Apparently, Mr. SChwartt " 
did not understanCt why ' I 
used the quote from 
Blackwell Let.,Ble uk yuu 

this Mr. Schwartz, what 
decent, honorable candidate 
would have supporters run 
around saying that he is 
human just like everyone 
else? You may not care if 
ReaJ{lIn is human. Schwartz. 
but you should. 

I find it interesting that in 
his entire .churlish letter 
Schwartz cannot find a single 
thing to say in favord of 
Reagan. [ thmk that he, like 
so many other intelligent 
people. wi1\ sigh and vote for 
Carter, because the alterna· 
tives are too dangerous. 

Gavin Wilkinson, (Daily 
Guardia", Oct 15), on the 
other hand, is a bona fide 
Reaganite. In dealing with 
this letter I would first of all 
like to point out that my 
writing is not tiresome; 
facetious and obscure 
perhaps. but never tiresome. 

In his letter Mr. Wilkinson 
accuses me of being biased 
against age. I only have a bias 
against age when it makes 
the candidate incapable of 
IlCrforming his duty in office. 
Eisenhower. for example. 
was incapacitated by a heart 
attack. Winston Churchill. 
on the other hand, made a 
fine Prime Minister when he 
was quite old. But Reagan is 
not Churchill, he is a fool that 
becomes more idiotic with 
each advancing year. 

In his next paralraph, Mr: 
Wilkinson states that Reagan 
balanced an unbalanced 
budget when he became 
governor. Wilkinson, alas, is 
duped by the master lies of 
HR. As Pat Brown points out, 
Reagan lied when he said he 
inherited a deficit. 

third rate demogogues like 
RR. 

Wilkinson's letter also 
exposed his economic 
ignorance. No, my dear 
mister Wilkinson, tax cuts do 
not slow inflation. they 
increase it - take Econ IB and 
find out. As for cutting 
government, what does our 
brilliant former governor 
intend to do, make social 
security voluntary? End 
welfare payment? (He 
obviously doesn't give a 
damn about the underprivi· 
leged). Or perhaps he will end 
federal research, thus 
dashing our chances for 
future greatness. 

Wilkinson's trite prosaism, 
"What America needs now is 
a strong leader\ '; is So banal 
that Ronald Reagan must 
have said it. [ think that that 
truism belongs under the 
what.this-countrir·needs.is. 
a-good·five·cent-cigar cate· 
gory. Lucky for us. RQnny 
must have found it some· 
where- probably in Lift 
magazine. Thus the ignor-
ance,. the lack of originality. 
the racism and the bad 
writing of Wilkinson's letter 
show that he is a Reagan 
follower. But the greatest 
sins of Reagan and his 
menagerie are lack of 
compassion. and the absence 
of wisdom and foresight. 

Ronald Reagan, that 
medioore "R" actor. is now 
(in his own deranged mind) 
playing his last tbopefully) 
and greatest role; that of 
savior of the United States. 
Unfortunatdy, I fear that the 
ending will be more like IN 
W.Ift,. than &titi_ for 
&mzo. .

those to which he is

Protest effects sad 
Editor: 

Reading about the student protests at the Saxon·Atkinson 
reception earlier t his week saddened me; it did not boost my 
sense of pride in my university. I wish protesters would think 
of long·range effects of their actions. Dainton, F. wrote (in 
Nature, 1980): 

"The single most important factor in the diminution in 
public esteem of the universities was the unacceptable 
behaviour of that tiny minority of militant students which 
was give~ whollr dispropo~tionately m~ified coverage by 
the media. ThiS made It much easier for successive 
governments to restrict the resources they were prepared to 
make available to universities." 

Although written about the events in the late 19608 and 
early 1970s. these words are equally valid for today and, 

, unfortunately, tomorrow.

Mixed reaction to anti-draft activities 
Several off·duty naval 

recruits pushed their way 
throulfh the group, uttering 
obsenlties and something 
about "national pride." 

Two lawyers walked 
briskly down the courthouse 
steps . They , too, looked 
bothered and spoke disap-
provingly to one another in 
less than hushed tones. 

The "media" was there· a 
local television station and 
several newspaper writers 
and photographers . 

transfonni~ the occasion 
into a "medIa event." 

And thus began the San 
Di~ Students for Peace 
rally for the trial of the "San 
Diego Three." 

The 15 picketers marched 
in a circle in front of the 
downtown County Municipal 
Court chanttng anti·

carrying posters emblazoned 
with such mess3gleS as "Why

Their conversation drifted 
from sports to the weather 
and finally turned to what 
they thought of the 
demonstration outside . 
"They ought to be happy' 
they're here and just serve, ' 
one of the officers said. "At 
least we don't have to be out 
on the street this afternoon," 
another said. 

And as the time carne near 
for the picketers to move 
inside, a young lawyer 
stopped several reporters and 
began to expound on how 
"what they're doing i~n't the 
way it was back ln the 
sixties. 

"I used to go to UCSD and 
in those days, we were really 
radical...we had a cause." he 
said. 

"Now 1 don't know if they 
know what they're doillfJ. I . 
mean, why don t they have 
any national I~pride?" he 
oontinued. "If they don't 
think America needs military .1 
superirity, then they all have 
their heads up their asses." \ 

The JIUlIl went on to tell 
bow he "defends people like 
this," his polyester double-
knit suit bJowmg in the stiff 
breeze. 

"Sure I'd defend any ct 
, th ' them .. .1 mean, man. at s 

what 1 make my living off ct," 
he said. 

"Listen, man, 1 gotta go," 
he said as he left, walking 
through the dwindling picket 
line . 
• "lIell no '#fe won't go. We 
won't die for Texaco." The 
picketers laughed and 
str~led off to the courtroom 
upst31rs.

set Friday 
continued from pale 1 
transmissions before and 
during the incident, all police 
reports filed subsequent to 
the arrests and intelligence 
reports on the SDSP in police 
files. 

However. the ju. denied 
a defense request for 
information on alleged 
excessive use of force by the 
police. Defense counsel Ted 
Burner of the National 

. Lawyers Guild asked for 
police personnel records that 
might reveal previous misuse 
of forre by the officers 
involved in the arrests.

ASUC Lobby rates 
state legislators 

Students are not the only 
ones getting report cards 
these days, In fact, members 
of the California State 
Legislature were recently 
graded by UC students, 

The report cards, issued by 
the UC Student Lobby, were 
based on legislators' votes on 
13 separate bills of 
significance to students, 

The policy areas addressed 
by the 13 measures selected 
included student housing, 
equal opportunity in higher 
education, unemployment 
insurance benefits for 
students, tuition, child care 
and privacy of student 
records. 

The average grade received 
by members of the Senate 

was a "B" (76,01 percent), 
The Assembly average for 
the session was 76.13 percen t 
- also a "B." 

"As a whole, the Legisla-
ture was quite responsive to 
student needs," stated UC 
Student Lobby Co-Director 
Amiel A. Jaramillo. "But we 
were particularly pleased 
with the receptiveness of 
many members of the Senate 
this past year. The Senate's 
76 percent is one of the 
highest average scores we 
have ever recorded in that 
house." 

The UC Student Lobby, 
which represents approxi-
mately 130,000 UC students. 
supported 10 of the 13 bills 
used in the grading. 

Children suffer more 
Youngsters under the age 

of four suffer many more 
serious burns, poisonings 
and head injuries than those 
in the more active, indepen-
dent years between four and 
14, a year-long study by the 
Childhood Accident Preven-
tion Program (CAPP) at the 
UCSD Center has revealed. 

An even mose surprising 
finding is that 86 percent of 
the poison cases, 74 percent 
of the burn cases and 60 
percent of the non-vehicle-
related head injury cases take 
place at home with mothers 
present. 

As a result, CAPP will 
conduct a year's trial 
accident prevention effort 

aimed at mothers with 
children under the age of 
four , with Escondido as the 
target community for the 
pilot project. 

Financed with a $225,000 
grant from the US Depart-
ment of Health and Human 
Services, CAPP plans to 
reach mothers with infor-
mation and materials 
enabling them to anticipate 
and avoid the major kinds of 
unexpected hazards young-
sters experience at each stage 
of development. 

The prevention program 
will focus on the major 
causes of accidental injuries 
to children - poisonings due 
to drugs and household

Fishing fans join in follies 
BY MIKE FISCHER 

This year's Deep Sea Fishing Derby, sponsored by the 
Campus Recreation Department, lured 44 entrants for the 
half-<lay event on Saturday. The competition has been 
plagued by a lack of interest to past year so Church Gorman, 
the Outdoor Recreation director, was especially pleased with 
the turnout of both individuals and ichthyoids. 

Conditions were excellent. The water was calm, the sky 
was clear and the wind was down. The group gathered at 
H&M Landing in Mission Bay at 5:45 am, rented the tackle 
they needed and headed out to see 40 minutes later. The 
destination was four miles northwest of the port. The Quarry 
was mackerel, barracuda and bonito.

Observatory. 

In addition to her goal of 
encouraging women and 
minorities to enter scientific 
fields, Burbidge would like to 
emphasis the importance of 
funding of scientific projects 
and education. 

"Many people don't realize 
the importance of science 
today. Even if you're not 
going to be a scientist , you 'll 
have a hard time getting 
along without some basic 
knowledge of science," she 
said . 

Burbidge said that she will 
not leave her post at UCSD to 
devote her full time to AAAS. 

''I'll spend a year just 
learning, then I'll chair the 
board," she said.

Sosna and Noval say that 

the officers who arrested 
them would not allow them to
