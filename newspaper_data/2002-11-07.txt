Students vote in Calif. election 
About 500 students vote at UCSD polls 
By MARNEnE FEDER IS 

Staff Writer 
Despite the efforts of several 

campus organiza ti ons to get young 
people to register for the elections, 
po ll workers said only 479 on-cam-
pus students ac tually came our to 
vote at the UCSD polling places on 

ov. 5. Those who did take part in 
the elections joined other 
Cali fo rnians and the rest of the 
nation for the 2002 general elec-
tions. 

Both the Muir Commons and 
Price Center precincts reported a 
majority of student voters at the 
elections and also a few staff mem-
bers. But according 10 precinct 
Director Richard Marcus of Price 
Center polls, "out of the 700 bal-
lots available [at the Price Center 
precinct], only [239] were used." 

However, the Youth Vote 
Coalition, an organization that 
worked to increase voter turnout, 
reported that 1,500 students were 
registered on campus through sev-
eral events held earlier this year. 
These included barbecues, 
Welcome Week fairs and a concert. 
The statewide group was also able 
to register 40,000 students 
throughout California , an 
improvement from last year, 

A.S. Council

resolution 

Reporting of 
incidents in 

. questIon 
By CARLAN WENDLER 

Senior Staff Writer 

In response to this year's Clery 
Report, which annually summa-
rizes UCSD's crime statistics, the 
A.S. Council recently passed a res-
olution reaffirming the student . 
council's position on hate crimes at 
UCSD. 

The Resolution on Hate Crime 
Reporting calls for a more inclu-
sive definition of hate crimes and 
urges Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
to "not only address but also take 
action" to reduce the number of 
these crimes on campus. 

Drafted over a year ago, the 
original Resolution on Hate 
Crimes Reporting was passed as a 
response to the events of Sept. 11, 
2001. This year's resolution was 
altered and passed in response to 
revelations about a discrepancy in

San Diego's online 
services ranked fourth 

Brown study places city 
high among 70 other cities 

By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

The city of San Diego's Web 
site was ranked the founh most 
useful site out of the e-
Governments in America's 70 
largest cities, which was conducted 
this year at Brown University. This 
is the second time the annual sur-
vey of city-operated Web sites was 
conducted by Brown, with San 
Diego placing first in 2001. 

"We work pretty hard on try-
ing to be one of the top leaders in 
the nation," said Bill Cull, the e-
Government program manager 
for the city of San Diego. "When 
we take part in surveys like 
Brown University's, we'll get the 
feedback from those surveys and 
try to improve." 

One example Cull gave is the 
recent addition to the city's Web 
site of searching capabilities, a 
result of findings that suggested 
that more than 30 percent of 
internet users prefer using search 
engines rather than navigation. 
Cull implemented Google and has 
had "tremendous success" with it. 

The rankings assigned to each 
city were determined through a 
variety of methods, said Darrell 
West, the head researcher on the 
Brown study. 

"We look at more than two 
dozen different features of gov-
ernment Web sites ". that the 
average citizen would be look-
ing at," West said. "In general, 
San Diego has made a great 
effort." 

West cited the site's excep-
tional interactive and research 
features that garnered San Diego 
such high rankings. 

"Their Web site has a 
[Geographic Information 
System] mapping capability, 
which is interactive so that you 
can ask questions," he said. "It's a 
nice feature for economic devel-
opment, or for a citizen who's just 
looking for some information." 

Once the researchers have 
evaluated the city's Web site, it is 
assigned a numerical score, which 
determines its national ranking. 

Four points were awarded for

Free speech rights 
discussed by forum 
S.O.L.O. hosts event to 
debate First Amendment 

By LAUREN FERRIS 
Contributing Writer 

As issues surrounding freedom 
of speech rights continue to be 
debated at UCSD, Student 
Organi zati ons and Leadership 
Opportunities held a seminar 
titled "Do we need freedom of 
the press?" at the Price Center on 
Nov. 4. The hour-long seminar 
was part of S.O.L.O. 's Passport to 
Leadership program. 

The annual seminar di s-
cussing freedom ot speech 
touched on the , he First 
Amendment, and more specifical-
ly, how the right to free speech 
relates to the ethics of journalism. 

Joined by a group of about 20 
students, discussion leader and 
local journalist Kate Callin began 
her presentation by proposing 
four scenarios that dealt with top-
ics ranging from the pressure to 
sensationalize news stories to 
attract readers to the abuse of 
power by media agencies. 

Students offered their opin-
ions and discussed with one 
another the different arguments 
that surround the issue of free 
speech, and when it was and was 

not appropriate to sacrifice the 
tru th. She also offered per onal 
examples and situations that she 
herself experienced as a journal-
is t. 

Call in spoke to snldents about 
her involvement in a media ethics 
wa tchdog group call ed th e 
Society of Profe ssional 
Journalists. SPJ has a few San 
Diego branches, including one at 
San Diego State Uni versity, 
prompting Call in to exprcs her 
wishes to begin a student chapter 
of SP] at UCS D with the help of 
students. She explai ned that it 
would enable students to discuss 
freedom of speech and its rda-
tionship to the UCS D Principles 
of Communi ty in open forum 
and internal debates. 

T he seminar comes at a par-
ticularly rel evant time for the 
campus community. Recent 
debates on free speech have 
brought the issue to the limelight, 
spldfically concel'ling the rights 
of such organiza tions as The KOIIII/ 
and the Che Cafe. 

The Koala drew fi re last year

In the Nov. 4 issue of the Guardian, the caption accompanying the photograph titled 
"Islam Awareness Week" stated that practicing Muslims are required to pray three times 
daily. They actually are required to pray five times per day. In the same issue, the arti-
cle ti tled "Blood and Guts" referred to Herbet Marcuse as a Marxist psychologist. He was 
actually a Marxist philospher. In the same issue, the article endorsing Propsotion 5 1 
refers to a 30 percent sales tax revenue from the Department of Motor Vehicles. The 
tax was actually J revenue tax.

Director of Housing and Dining Services

functions of his department. Cunningham 
reported that this year 93 .7% offreshmen are

working on constructing housing at the 
Eleanor Roosevelt College. T he project bud-
get totals $106 million and will create a $69 
million yearly mortgage, once completed. 

The cost of housing, Cunningham said, is 
solely carried by srudenrs and is not funded by 
the state. VVhen asked about other sources of 
funding for housing such as alumni donations

atively young institution "our srudents haven't 
made their money yet." 

Cunningham also reported that his office 
has worked to expand Triton Plus under the 
encouragement of current A.S. President 
Jenn Brown, who served as Vice Presidenr 
Internal last year, and members of last year's 
A. S. Counci l. Triton Plus is now being 
accepted at Chipotle and Baskin Robins. 
Triton Plus is expected to soon expand to 
Papa John's Pizza, B1's and Islands. 

Cunningham also discussed a housing pro-
ject for transfer students and upper-classmen 
that is scheduled to be completed in 2005. 
The project will include apartment-style 
housing, including underground parking, 
near RIMAe. It will be run by a group sepa-
rate from H&DS.

Affirmative action review requested 
Ten states file brief to Supreme Court 

By KENTON BARNES 
Cavalier Daily (U. Virginia) 

(U-WIRE) CHAR-
LOiTESVILLE, Va. - In an 
attempt to gai n a sta ndardized set 
of guidel ines dictating affirmative 
anion practices, 10 sta tes have 
fi led a joint bri ef to the U.S. 
Supreme Court seekin g c1 ari fi ca-
tion on the policy. 

T he case requests that the 
Supreme Court revi ew the May 
2002 Gmtffr v. Bollinger' deci ion, 
in which the Sixth U.S. Circuit 
COlirt of Appea ls uph eld the 
University of Michi ga n Law 
School's affirmative action policy 
as constitutional. 

The 10 states fi ling the brief are 
urging the Supre me Court to hea r 
the case so they can determine if 
their affirmative action policies are 
consti tutional. 

If the Suprcme Court decides to 
hear the case, it would be t.he t1rst 
time the court has ruled on affirma-
tive action si nce the 1978 Regents of 
tilt Ul1roersiry of Calljo171io v. Bokkr 
case. 

According to University of 
Virginia politics professor David 
Klein, who teaches courses on judi-
cial politics, the Supreme Court 
potentially could overmrn aftlrma-
tive action in higher education if 
they hear the case. 

Klein added that it has been the 
Supreme Court's policy to all ow 
the lower circuit COllrts to rule on 
matters of affirmative action, but 
now the situation is to the point 
where a consensus decision is 
almost impossible. 

"It makes sense for the 
[Supreme] Court to step in because 
you have circuit court decisions 
going in difft:rcnt direcrions," he 

said. 
Karen I lolt, director of the 

Office of Equal Opportuni ty 
Programs, said the Supreme Court's 
possible rul ing could have serious 
impact on university procedures. 

"This is a case that the equal 
opportunity programs' office and 
the uni versity will be watching 
closel y," Holt said . 

She added tha t the universi ty is 
prepared to review its policies if the 
Supreme COlirt make a genera l 
ruling on afti rmarive acti on. 

"Assuming the ruling is relevant 
to univer ity practices, the university 
will act in accordance," she said. 

Klein said that, because the 
Sixth U.S. Circuit oun of Appea ls 
alrea dy rul ed on the case, the 
Supreme Court is the only court 
left t11at may make a decision. 

"The only place It:ft to go is the 
Supreme Court," he said.

showed their " I Voted" stickers. 
Music played in the background as 
students asked A.S. Council mem-
bers about election in formation. 
Additionally, they could receive a 
state-issued voting guide to fu rther 
inform themselves about candi-
da tes and the issues on the ballot. 

"By voicing their opinions, snl-
dent votes could actuall y determine 
who will win in t11e rea lly close 
races," said Muir College 
Freshman Senator am 13 ni. 

An Election Day party was also 
held at Porter 's Pub by the Graduate 
Student Associa tion on the eveing pf 
Nov. 5 to push voter participation. 
Loca l bands T he Masses and 
Danielle Lo Presti gave a li ve per-
formance for those who attended. 
Students who could show a valid

sored an election forum for those 
who had further questions on 
propositions and c:mdidates. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Councilmember Kate Maull said 
that the event was "to hel p educate 
students on the issues and to 
remind them to vote." 

Some students have expressed 
their concern about the lack of 
interest in attending these elections 
among their peers. 

"As students, it's time for us to 
come out and vote," said Sarah 
Piazza, a freshman at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College. "It's ridiculolls 
how a lot of people don't know t11e 
issues that concern us." 

According to the California 
Student Public Interest Research 
Group, about 20 percent of people 
between the ages of 18 to 24 partic-
ipated in national elections in the 

last cycle, and only 5 percent vote 
in the local elections. T hese statis-
tics shows that the number of 
young peopl e who vote is less than 
half of adults. 

However, those who were pre-
sent at the polls al so stressed the 
signifi ca nce of participating in the 
el ection process. 

" I think it's important to exer-
cise the right that I have to give my 
input in how the government is 
ran," said third year Marshall sm-
dent Lila Mciver. "I feel reall y 
lucky to have this right. " 

Others feel a responsibility 
toward voting and are more opti-
mistic that their voice still matters 
in state and national politics. 

"It's important to stay acti ve 
even if the impact is minimal, 
because it's still an impact," said 
Jake Nare , a freshman at Earl 

S.O.L.O.: Koala, Che Cafe discussed at forum 
continued from page r 

groups found racist or offensive. 
The Che Cafe has run into prob-
lems with the UCSD administra-
tion for hosting material on the 
Web that allegedly promotes what 
the FBI has deemed "terrorist" 
organizations. 

"T he power that media has is 
enormous," Callin said. "You can 
ruin people's lives or make small 
businesses into thriving compa-
nies." 

Callin talked about instances in 
which a single article helped to sig-
nificantly expand a small business, 
attracting both customers and 
investors. 

Doreen Toomalatai, a sopho-
more at Thurgood Marshall 
College, attended the seminar to 
get more information about the 
press and media. 

"You've got all the extremes 
here," Toomalatai said of the pub-
lications on campus. "The 
Gua1'dion is pretty neutral, than 
youha~~ others like The California 
ReVieW. 

With regards to the First 
Amendment issues that The Koala 
raises, Eleanor Roosevelt ollege 
junior Chris Hiestand said the 
S.O.L. . seminar offered some 
insight on the subject. 

"I think the freedom of speech 

is very important," Hiestand said. 
"If someone is printing a bad paper, 
then [the input of] A.S. doesn't 
matter because their readers will 
decrease." 

Callin ended her remarks by 
saying that the power journalists 
possess can often times have nega-
tive results. 

"That kind of power can go to 
your head," he said. "Especially 
when the First Amendment doesn't 
put any restrictions on you." 

Another seminar is expected to 
be held on the same topic next year, 
and information on PJ ca n be 
accessed th rougb the .O.L. . 
program.

NCAA's eligibility 
standards may 

harm education 
Last week, the National Collegiate 

thletic Association announced a set of 
changes to the academic criteria that athletes 
must meet in order to pl ~y Division I sports. 
The plan is intended to place more weight 
on GPA rather than SAT score, re fl ecting a 
trend in college admissions, and to push col-
legiate athletes to perform at a higher level 
of achievement in the classroom, 

\Nhile the plan is admi rable in its 
attempt to force sports stars to hit the 
books, it fearures some interesting contra-
di ctions and unrealistic goa ls that make it 
po sible that educational qua li ty will actual-
ly decrease overall. 

The most touted change in eligibility 
requirements is the removal of the lower 
limit from SAT scores. Currently, students 
are only eligible to compete in Division I ath-
letics if they have scored an 820 or higher on 
the SAT Now, even a student scoring a 400 
on the SAT - the lowest possible mark -
could be eligible, providing he has a very 
high GPA to balance out the low SAT score. 
This effectively gives more weight to a sru-
dent's GPA, while reducing the importance 
of the purportedly culturally biased SAT. 

To be realistic, anyone who scores a 400 
or 500 on the SAT IS almost certainly not 
prepared for college-leve l academics . 
Furthermore, a student whose academic 
preparation is low enough that he would 
receive such a depre sed SAT score, yet 
whose GPA is high enough to secure him 
eligibili ty, has probably ben fitted from 
gross grade inflation, and is again unpre-
pared for college. 

Lately the sports world has seen amaz-
ingly talented high school students bypass-
ing coll egiate athletics because they would 
be academically ineligible to compete, and 
going straight into.JJrofession al sports, This 
move to lower SAT requirements is clearly 
a bid to get these tafented athletes into 
NCAA play - and the money derived from 
thei r championship-worthy pl ay into the 
NCAA's and schools' coffers. 

It is true that the money made from cham-
pionships and ticket sales ultimately goes 
back to the srudents and can serve to improve 
their education, and so admitting these tal-
ented but academically unprepared athletes 
to major colleges may 111 fact help the school-
minded students, But it cannot be ignored 
that the NCAA is encouraging grade infla-
tion and the admittance of students who are 
probably not prepared for a rigorous acade-
mic environment - which can only lead to 
more g:ade inflation and has the potential to 
diminish the value of classroom tnne. 

The Guardian feels that while these 
reforms could benefit college athletics and 
college educa tions, the NCAA must be 
strict in monitoring their impacts and 
enforcing academic excellence,

Wellstone memorial turns into political rally 
Democrats face repercussions for party line performance 

By DUSTIN FRELICH 
Staff Writer 

O ne Associated Press headline for 
the Oct. 29 memorial service of late 
U.S . Sen. Paul Wells tone (D-Minn.) 
Said , "Wellstone coll eagues join thou-
sands for Minnesota memoria l. " T hat 
same articl e was justly rena med 
"Well stone farewell becomes political" 
by a Minnesota TV station . Even 
before theIr colleague had been 
buried , Democrats were playing poli-
tics In the name of a dead man, chant-
ing "Win for Paul !" Morbid ? I'm 
afraid so. 

In what has now become a cb ssic 
example of partisan po litics, leaders of 
the Democratic Party from all over the 
counu'y flocked to Minnesota on Oct. 
29 to pay tribute to Wellstone, who 
had tragica lly died in a plane crash only 
days before. However, it looked more 
like a full -fl edged political rally than 
the somber memorial service one 
would expect, complete with TV mon-
itors, blari ng rock music and 20,000 
democratic supporters. 

"I covered the Democratic ational 
Conve nti on two years ago in Los 
Angeles. I know conventi ons, and I've 
bee n to a lot of memorial services, 
unfortunately, and ... this was a conven-
tion, " said syndicated radio talk show 
host Hugh Hewitt regarding the 
memorial service. 

Ki cking off the partisanship, 
Wellstone's sons notified Vice 
President Dick Cheney that he would 
not be allowed to attend Oct. 29's 
proceedings, saying Cheney might 
con tribute to a "circus atmosphere." 
But it was none other than 
Wellstone's son wh o had chan ted "We 
will win !" at the sa me service. I 
th ought this was supposed to be a 
memo ri al service for the late Paul 
Well tone, not an exclu ionary politi-
cal rall y. onetheless, the politica l 
rivalry did not stop there. 

Many Republicans were jeered at

" 1 know conventimts J and 
I've been to a lot of memorial 
services, unfortunately, and 

this ' " .. . was a conventlOn, 
- Hugh HeWitt. radio talk show host 
during the event. This reached a cli-
max when Sen. Trent Lott was booed 
when his face was shown on the large 
TV monitors. Contrasted with the 
wild cheering accompanying former 
President Bill Clinton, Walter 
Mondale (Wellsrone's senate replace-
ment) and other prominent 
Democrats, the picture is indeed an 
ugly one : You're only allowed to 
mourn Wellstone if you're a 
Democrat. 

Even the poli tically independent 
Gov. Jesse Ventura (Minn.) was booed. 
After the rally, Ventura said, ". feel 
used. I feel violated and duped over the 
fact that [the memori al servicel turned 

into nothing more than a political 
rally." 

Ventura also took notice of the hoo-
ing of Republican Sen. Lott. 

"In the case of Sen. Lott flying all 
the way up here and being booed ... I 
think the Democrats should hang their 
heads in shame," Ventura said . 

It's no wonder that while Ventura 
said that he had planned on appoint-
ing a Democrat to Wells tone 's sea t for 
the remainder of the term , he changed 
hi s mind after attending the service, 
instead naming State Plann ing 
Commissioner Dea n Barkley, 
Reform Party member, on Nov. 4. 

The breaking poin t that caused 
Lott and Ventura to leave the rally 
occurred during a speec h by 
Wellstone's campaign manager, Ri ck 
Kahn. His supposed eulogy included 
the surpri sing lines, "We are going to 
win this election," and "We are beg-
ging you to help us win th is senate 
election." 

Calling on Republica n senators by 
name, Kahn said, "Can you not hear 
your friend calling you one last time to 
step forward on his behalf to keep his 
legacy alive and help us win this elec-
tion for Paul Wellstone'" 

Kahn seems to forget th at 
Republicans showed up to th e 
"memorial service" to pay respects to 
Wellstone as a friend and colleague, 
not as political supporters; they are, 
after all, on opposite ends of the 
politica l spectrum . The argument is 
fatally flawed: Unless you agree with 
someone, you may not pay your 
respects. And to travel to the memor-
ial service only to be assaulted by 
Kahn and 20,000 rabid Wellstone 
supporters is something with which 
Republican senators should not have 
had to put up.

LETIER TO THE EDITOR 
Previous letter fails to 

address both sides 
Editor: 

I found Krystal Young's letter 
to the edi tor (Oct. 3 I) a little 
ridic ulous. Young writes, "there is 
noth ing wrong with somebody 
thinking th at homosexua li ty is 
wrong." Bur then she goes on to 
c learly find something "wro ng 
with somebody thinking that 
homosexuali ry is wrong." She sees 

" 

surrender?) 
T he second major inconsisten-

cy that Young brings up is the 
assumption that those who ee 
homosexuali ty as mora lly repug-
nant do so "because he or she is 
different from oneself." This is 
si mply not true. T hose who view 
homosexuality as wrong don 't do 
so beca use homosexuals are differ-
ent from them, they do so because 
they th ink that homosex uali ry is 
wrong. Is You ng implyi ng that 

one wou ld need to 'I "troubli ng imbal-
ance of judgment," 
where she fi nd 
{hat homosexuals 
are less like ly to 
fi nd heterosexuali-
ty mora ll y wrong 
than heterosexuals 
are to fi nd homo-
sexuality immoral. 
Later, she claims, 
"judging a homo-
sexual as morally 
repugnant because 
he or she is differ-
ent from oneself is 
a si mple act of 
bias." 

Those who view 
homosexuality as 
wrong don't do so 

be a homosexuHI 
to have an opinio n 
about the issue' 

You ng is, how-
ever, correc t in her 
estimatio n that 
moral rejection of 
homosexuality is a 
bi as. Bur then , so 
is everything else 
we hold to be true. 
W ithou t our 
"biases" we are 
just floa ting al ong, 
without op inions, 
beliefs or st an-
dards. Besides, our 
motivati on to 
believe something 

because homosexu~ 
a1s are different from 

them, tlJey do so 
because they think 
homosexuality is 

" 
T here are sever-

al problems with 
thi s analysis. The 

un-ong, 
first: It does not matter what 
homosexuals think o f heterosexu-
als; that has absolutely no bearing 
on the issue. I could think that all 
people living in Mississippi should 
be shipped off to France; what the 
fin e folks of Mississippi think about 
me has nothing to do with whether 
my view is valid, intolerant or just 
pl ai n ridicul ous. (Side questi on; 
would France take them in or just 

.~. 

is irrelevant to 
whether it is true. (Take PHIL 10 
- you get to learn all about fal-
lacies.) 

The question here should not 
be what causes some people to view 
homosexuality as wrong, but 
whether such people have a point 
or are just old-fashioned bigots.

Persistent myths about date rape must 
be dispelled through understanding 

speak up, 
s eak out 

Parisa Baharian 
What is your fir st reaction 

when hear ing that a college girl 
has been da te raped or sexuall y 
assau lted? 

Is your reaction one of indig-
na ti on, skepticism, anger or fea r' 
I submit that your answer 
depends in large part on how you 
vi ew rape and sexual assau lts com-
mitted by someone known to the 
victim. 

So let's test your Date Rape IQ . 
T he following is a co mpletely fic-
tio nal scenario, but based on tru e 
reported accounts: 

Sam takes Sa rah to a parry, 
where they both have a few 
drinks. T his is the second date, 
and Sarah thinks Sam is a consid-
erate and kind guy. Sam says he 
wants her to come up to his room 
and listen to this great CD he just 
burned. As Sam walks Sarah up to 
his roo m, he cuddles and kisses 
her a littl e. When they arrive at 
his room, instead of playi ng the 
CD as she expects, Sam turns off 
the computer, shuts the door 
behind him and throws her on 
the fl oor. Sarah is completely 
bewildered, her shocked brain 
shrieking, "What happened to 
the nice guy I know and like?" 
Sam starts kjssing her, tearing at 
her clothes. Sarah starts strug-
glin g, repea ting, "No, get off 
me." Bu t Sam holds her down, 
pinning her wrists so that she 
can't esca pe fro m his unwanted 
touches and violence. T he next 
day, Sarah reportS the attack to 
the ca mpus police, and Sam is 
charged with sexua l assault and 
battery, not rape, because he did 
everything but ac tua l penetra-
tio n. Sam is given p robatio n, 
because administrators cite the 
use of alcohol as a mitigating cir-
cumstance. 

So now tha t you've absorbed 
the situati on, what do you think) 

Did any of the fo llowing six myths 
cross your mind' 

Myth one is that a woman who 
agrees to go to a man's house or 
room consents to have sex - so 
when the man initiates it, it is not 
really rape. In the scenario above, 
because Sarah willingly went up to 

am ' room, it was rea onabl e fo r 
Sam to expect sex and to infer that 
she was consenting to sex by sim-
ply bei ng there. 

The reali ry is tha t the act of 
going up to Sam's room does not 
forfei t Sarah's ri ght to say "no" to 
sex if he makes his move, nor does 
that act give in ferrence that she 
wants sex . Consent cannm be 
implied from ambiguous actions, 
and when Sarah explicitly said 
"no," Sam was req uired by law to 

" The truth is that rape or 
a sexual assault of any 
nature is aU about con~ 

trol and dominance, 
and has nothing to do 

with sexual fantasies or 
frustrations. " 

honor her wishes and stop. 
California Penal Code section 

26 1.6 clearly states that "In prose-
cutions .. . 'co nse nt ' !. hall be 
defined to mean positi ve coopera-
ti on in ac t or attitude pursuant to 
an exercise of free will . T he per-
son J~us t act freely and volunta ri-
ly .... 

Myth two is that because a girl 
acts or dresses a certain way, she's 
asking for sex - th us, she has her-
self to blame if she is raped . 
Because Sarah went witll Sam to 
tile party, and they were on kissi ng 
terms, Sam could reasonably 
expect from these flirtations that 
she wanted sex, so his violent 
actions were justified. 

Wrong: T he truth is that no 
matter how a woman chooses to 

dress, act or eve n fl irt in a gIven 
situation, she does not in any wa~' 
con lone the violence by her da te 
to fo rce her in to sex. . 

M yth three is that when .1 
woman say "no," it t ea ll" IIlcam 
"ves ." T he mentali tv )()m~t11llc) I) 
that , "Oh, she's iust leadlll!! IIIC 
on," "She's JlISt plaYIll )! ha~'d to 
get," or, "She doesn't really 1I11:,ln 
it. " . 

The reality 15 that she mcans 
"no. n T his myth underl ies the 
perva ivc socie tal a tti tudc~ that 
perpetu ate an atmosp here that 
allows - an d even encourages -
date rape or sexua l assa ult. Clearl l', 
the mantra th at needs to be 
drummed into oc iery's e:lr IS: 
\Vhen you hear "no," take It as 
"no" and cease all advances. 

M yth four is the beli ef that 
rape is a sexual act. 

T he rrurh is that rape or a sex-
ual assault of any nature is :111 
about control and dominance, and 
has nothing to do with sexual fan-
tasies or frustrati o ns. 

Myth fi ve is that once the 
physical injuries of th e attac k 
hea l, the woman will easily he 
able to get over what happened to 
her. 

T he rea li ty of the situatio n is 
that it's not so easy for a wOll1 an 
to move on whe n, in essence, she 
was fo rced to be a sexual sbve. 
T ho ug h the ou tward injur ies 
hea l, the mental and psychologi-
cal effects wi ll always haunt her 
in some respects. The feeling of 
violence and viola tion go beyond 
the single ac t of penetrat io n or

ma ny victims say take a long time

Off-campus housing search forces tough decisions 
By BERTRAND FAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Perhaps one of the most com-
mon questions of UCSD students 
reaching the middle o f their college 
career is not, "How the hell did 
Star Wraps become the last non -
corporate entity in the Price 
Center when their food was by far 
the worst out of all the other ones 
that got booted, which is not to say 
tha t the other ones were vety good 
to begin with?" but, "Should I live 
in a house or an apartment?" 

Most of this questi on can be 
answered by another: "H ow much 
effort do you really want to put in 
it' " 

Let's just briefly go over how 
annoying it is to get a house , and 
then compare it to how relati vely 
easy it is to get an apartment. 

T he first thing you may notice 
when looking through c1assifieds is 
that there are a lot more apart-
ments for rent than there are hous-
es. And from this slim picking of 
houses, you can scra tc h off a good 
majority of them because you 'll 
never be able to afford them. 

But let's say you do find a house . 
You ca ll up the landlord and take 
the grand tour, at which point he 'll 
ask the inevitable question: "So, are 
you students)" 

Now, if you're an idiot and you 
answer the affirmative, you can pret-
ty much kiss goodbye any chance of 
getting the place. Admitting to stu-
dent status when trying to rent a 

house is a lot like brandishing a 
swastika at an interview for a non-
profit Jewish organjzation. 

I learned about this the summer 
before my sophomore year, with 
less than a month to find a place to 
live, eagerly awai ting a response 
from my landlord, which eventually 
turned out to be two words repeat-
ed over and over again in broken 
English : "No students! No stu-
dents!" Technically, there are some 
housing laws that prevent such dis-
crimination, but technically, land-
lords can do whatever they want. 

Now, you may be saying to 
yourself, "OK, so I'm still a stud ent 
- what am I supposed to say, 
then ?" Well , at this point in your 
life, if you've never li ed before, now 
would be a good time to start. 
When they ask you what yo u do, 
say something out of an lIT Tech 
commercial. ''I'm the manager fo r 
broadband DSL installations." "I 
work with relational databases veri-
fying secretarial dj screpancies." 

When they ask you what com-
pany you work for, take a random 
word and add "Design" or 
"Development" after it : Zenith 
Design. Apex Development. When 
they ask for pay stubs, te ll them you 
don't get any, but you can give 
them your supervisor 's number. 
Scroll down your friends' cell 
phone numbers until you find one 
that has a polite, nondescript cell 
phone message , When they say 
they need physical evidence, say 
you'll bring in a letter from your 

COMMENTARY 

" At this point in your life, 
if you've never lied 

befare J now would be a 
good time to start. II 

supervisor, or ask them for a form 
th at your supervisor can fill out. 
G ive them the fax number to the 
Kinko 's on Villa La Joll a. T hen 
head down to Kinko's, pick out 
some nice resume paper, design a 
professional letterhead for your 
"company," and write yourself a 
letter describing how long you've 
worked there , and how much you 
make a month. Sky's the limit, but 
they usually request tri pie the 

monthly rent. 
Now, let 's compare that to the 

strenuous activity of getting an 
apartment. Drive up to the leasi ng 
o ffice, park, take a tour of an apart-
ment. When they ask if you're a 
student say, "Yes, as a matter of fac t, 
I am." When they ask what your 
income is, say, "parents," and leave 
them your parents' phone number. 
Then leave them a considerably 
smaller security deposit, and move 
in. 

Al though houses are more diffi-
cult to actually obtain, you'll appre-
ciate two important fea tures they 
have when compared to apartment 
complexes. T he first is that you get 
a lot of space for your rent when you 
get a house. And when your friends 
come and visit, they can park by the 
conveniently located curb next to 
your house . Apartments, on the 
other hand, have about five guest 
spaces that all say "Future Resident 
Parking," from which they won't 
hesitate to tow you if you've been 
there over 20 nanoseconds, and the 
other 500 are located six miles from 
your apartment. 

T he thing apartments do win 
the battle on are trash and mainte-
nance. If you live in a house, you 
may notice it starts to smell bad if 
you don 't put the rotting food in 
trash bags and eventually take them 
to the trash can . The trash can in 
apartments is a lot bigger, so 
instead of saying, "The trash can 's 
full - I guess we'll have to wait 
until next Monday to take out thi 

trash," you can put it into the 
amazing apartment trash bin that 
never gets fu ll. Furthermore, if 
your toilet breaks in all apartmcnt, 
you dia l the nu mber for mainte-
nance, and it usually gets taken care 
of th e same day. If your toil et 
breaks in a house, you call the land-
lord , get his voice mail, leave a mes-
sage, he ca lls you back two days 
later and says th at a plumber 'S com-
ing by, the plumber comes and says, 
"Wow. T his one's a tough o ne." 
works on it for about a wee k, and 
leaves you with a bi ll for $100 tim 
your landlord mi ght pay if he gets 
around to it in the next couple 
months or so. 

A few last tips if you do decide to 
go the house route: Don 't ass ume 
that you're going to be ~ ta ying there 
for three years, because the min ute 
they call sell the place, the!"rc going 
to. Don't assume that you're going 
to get your security depOSIt back. 
Just resign yourself to the fac t that 
it's gone and there's nothing you can 
do abollt it. But on the btight side, 
if they don 't tel l you what thcy're 
doin g with it 30 days after you move 
in, you can sue them for up to three 
ti mes the amount. Don 't a slime 
that anyo ne who te lls YO ll t hat 
they're going to live with YOll is 
going to live with you, and don't 
live with people just be calIse YOll 
told them you'd live with them. Tell 
roerybody you'll live with them, and 
pick the be tone. 

Because when it comes to hous-
ing, it's every man for hi mself.

Wellstone: Del1l0Crats desecrate funeral 
nmrinued from pal(~ 4 

Colem:Jn, suspended his c~mpaign 
until ,Iftcr the memorial service. I 
wi sh I could say the same about 
the Democrats .. 

The IlH:moria I scrvice-mrned-
politica l-rally of the hte Sen. 
,, 'e ll,tolle was" sad one indeed. 
Sad enough because of his death, 
hut even more so because 
Deillocra ts used it a~ a ploy to 
hold .1 poiltlcal rally that rivaled a 
I)c III 01.: r,lt IC National 

Convention. The respect paid to 
the late \Â¥ellstone was between 
zero and none. 

Wellstone was much more 
than just a political figure. [ Ie was 
a father, a husband and a loving, 
ca ring individual (sometimes too 
caring with taxpayers' money, if 
you know what I mean). But to 
bid farewell to him as no more 
than a pawn of the Democra tic 
National Party . is indeed very, 
vcry sad. 

W~lIstone gave hi life to poli-

Daily Aztec political cartoons under fire by campus community 
Some students allege depictions of Middle Easterners, Asians are racist 8, RAVEN TYSON It 

LESUEHACKm 
The Daily Aztec (San Diego State U.) 

(U-WIRE) SAN DIEGO - More than 
6,000 copies of Th~ Daily Azttc were taken 
from racks around campus on Oct. 3 I and 
piled on the Free Speech Steps by San Diego 
State University students angry over two 
recent political cartoons published in the 
paper. 

For about an hour, more than 30 students 
made requests for an apology from the news-
paper and said the cartoons, published on 
Sept. 25 and Oct. 22, were racist. 

T he pile of newspapers were closely 

guarded by the protesting crowd, who told 
onlookers, "If YOll want to read The Daily 
Aztec you have to come through us." 

Chants, sllch as, "What do we want? An 
apology! Who do we want it from? The Dllily 
Aztec! When do we want it' Now!" coult! be 
heard along Centennial Walkway and 
throughout Aztec Center. 

Protesters also taped down a few dozen 
copies of the paper to outline the word 
"racism" on the top stair of the steps. 

The smdents were angered over one car-
toon where Vasser Arafat and Saddam 
Hussein were depicted as camels. President 
George W Bush is in the middle of the fig-
ures dressed as a cowboy saying, "Definitely 

time for a 
regime 
change. " The 
other cartoon, 
published Oct. 
22, showed a 
large man 
labeled as 
China speaking 
in broken 
English and 
denying knowl-
edge of North 
Korea's nuclear 
arms.

Camel controversy: The two anthropomorphic Cilmels from a Sept 25 Cilrtoon in 
The Dotfy Aztec are said by some students to add to post-9/11, an~-Arab sentiments. 

o m a r 
Behnawa, one 
of the organiz-
ers of the 
protest, said the 
Sept. 25 
"Camels gone 
wild" cartoon 
was stereotypi-
cal of Midd le 

Easterners. He said the cartoon turned his 
stomach. 

"It hit my nerve," Behnawa said. "It hurts 
me to see that more students don't under-
stand." 

Behnawa explained that to Middle 
Easterners, being called a camel or camel 
jockey is derogatory and insulting. He com-
pared the term to someone calling a black 
person a nigger. 

"We're supposed be intellectual about this 
- we're supposed to be open-minded," he 
said. "We shouldn't promote hate and things 
that fuel that hatred. " 

Another protester, psychology gradllate 
student Marwan Arikat, said that people have 
used Middle Easterners as an easy target 
since the Sept. 11 attacks. 

"Everyone has taken a hit on Middle 
Eastern people because they see it on the 
media every day - Middle Eastern terror-
ists, Palestinian terrorists," he said. "There is 
the connotation that Middle Easterners are 
the terrorists. They think they can get away 
with anything. They think they can say any-
thing about Middle Eastern people and get 
away with it." 

The Dllily Aztec political cartoonist Dan 
Carino wrote a column Oct. 22 explaining 
his reasoning for choosing camels to portray 
Arafat and Hussei n. 

In his response, he said it wasn't to repre-
sent the people of the Middle East as camels. 
He said if he had intended this, he would 
have labeled the camels as Iraq and Palesti ne, 
or left them without labels. 

"As the cartoonist, I did not create a con-
troversial cartOon just for the ake of bei ng 
controversial." Carino wrote. "It was suppose 
to be a poignant commentary utilizing visual 
metaphors." 

Under scrutiny: A personified China speaking In 
broken English appeared in the Od. 22 Dotfy Aztec. 

He also said that the title, "Camels gune 
wild ," was used in the context of evolutiun 
because both leaders have evolved through-
out the years to a ttain "perverted causes to 
the full disadvantage of tneir people." 

When a ked why he didn 't use another 
animal such as a tiger or bear, Carino said 
that it doesn't fit the context of the message . 

"Let's be honest, I really haven'c seen a 
polar bear living in the desert," he wrote.

Hate: Attorney General, 
Clery Report numbers differ 

continued {rom page I 
the reporting of hate crimes 
benveen the annual UCSD Clery 
Report and the office of 
California's Attorney General. 

The resolution demands that 
"UCSD and [the UC Office of the 
President] each employ a full -time 
staff person to address hate 
crimes," as agreed to in a confer-
ence held between the UCOP and 
the UC Student Association , 

Under Clery Report parame-
ters, only one hate-motivated 
crime would be reported for 2001. 
The UCSD Police Department, 
however, uses more inclusive defi-
nitions for hate crimes and hate 
incidents dl3t would ind icate that 
six hate-related crime or incidents 
occurred at UCSD last year. 

According to Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior Tom Chapman, 
who proposed the resolution in his 
last week as senator, "UC tends to 
underreport hate crimes and sexual 
assaults ." 

Chapman does not expect the 
A.S. Council to lobby political 
leaders as much this yea r, When 
the resol ution was passed in 200 I, 
the counci l sent letters to federal 

and state legislators, as well as 
President George W. Bush, con-
cerning hate cri mes on college 
campu es, 

With a shrinking budget and an 
increa ed student population, it 
may not be easy for UCSD to cre-
ate a separate office for addressing 
ha te crimes o n campus. 

According to A,S . Council 
sources, the UCSD ad ministration 
has attempted to address this issue 
through the Student Office of 
Human Relations since passage of 
the 2001 resolution. UCS D offi -
cials did not respond to phone 
m essages by press time. 

"Being a hare-free zone 
requires a lot of things," Chapman 
said . "People's biases have to be 
kept to themselves," 

Though this resolution was one 
of his last acrs as ERC freshman 
senator, Chapman maintains that 
he will not rest until the numbers 
provide him reason to affirm that 
UCSD is a hate-free zone. 

"Tf [hate] cri llles were zero, that 
would be a large, large step to 
becoming a h ate-free zone and ,I 
we lcoming environlllcnt," 
Chapman said .

The Aztec wiil not print an apology. 

Zisko said she supports students 
using their right to free speech to 
voice their disapproval. However, 
she said she is bothered that the 
protesters destroyed newspapers 
and took thousands of copies off 
the racks. 

"The cure for this type of situa-
tion is more speech, not less 
speech," Zisko said. "This is not an 
effective way of dealing with com-
plaints." 

Zisko called University Police 
after receiving reports that papers 
were being destroyed . However, 
police couldn 't force protesters to 
return the newspapers to the racks 

because no one saw them deposit 
the pile at Aztec Center, University 
Police Sgt. Claudia McDaniel said. 

McDaniel said that if she were 
to force them, it would only make 
the problem worse, She said then 
not only would protesters be upset 
with The Daily Aztec, but with 
University Police as well . 

McDanie.l also said she didn't 
want protesters to think she was 
infringing on their free speech . 

Instead, Physica l Pl ant was 
called to move the newspapers and 
hose down the chalk writing that 
said "racism Doily Aztcc" on thc 
steps, Protesters helped luad the 
papers into the Physica l Pl ant 
truck, and a Doily Aztec empluyee 
later returned the newspapers to 
racks around campus.

Landscape Anew: One of the original takes on landscapes: 'Alamos" by Marcelo Pombos captures the spirit of exhibit currently on display 

International artists reinvent landscape 
ing to us again an aesthetic 

that we love" are the words 
inscribed on Ciel Bergman's 
painting "Antidote #2 ," "S The paintings in the new 

University Art Gallery exhibit, 
" Representing Landscape," give the old 
song a fresh and dynamic new rhythm. 
The artists o n exh ibit include Bergman, 
Jacci Den H~ rtog, Marcelo Pombo, 
Darren Waterston, Leigh Li-Yun Wen 
and Yek. 

What gives the exhibit its unique fla-
vor is the eclecticism of the approaches to 
landscape employed by the artists. 

Wen and Bergman were present at the 
exhibit's opening on Oct. 24. 

Wen's piece, "Water Mural VII," the 
largest piece on display, is particularly 
impressive for its composition and 
stature. 

As a Taiwanese immigrant, Wen paints 
the four Western elements: earth, air, fire 
and water (in Eastern culture there are 
five elements), partially as a means of cop-
ing with the collision and mingling of 
"philosophies of [her) homeland self-dis-
ci pline and selflessness, and the Western 
notions of ego, ali enation and desire." 

She considers her paintings deeply 
personal, saying that, "Painting is a form 
of meditation , The technique is only a 
vehicle for the mentality." 

Bergman is intensely passionate about 
the health of the Earth's ecosystem, a love 
that finds full fruition in her art, 

"The sky is changing," she said during 
Oct. 29's exhibit walk-through. "You can 
hardly see the sky for the jet fuel." 

(t is because of her love for the sky that 
Bergman, origina lly named C heryl , 
changed her name to "Ciel" - the 
French word for sky, 

Waterston's works are described by the 
gall ery as "meditations on fertility that 
lure us into a mystical world of exoticism 
and erotic sensuality," His worles are 
painted on wooden panels in the "old 
master" style, reminiscent of a Chinese 
dream world full of blood and butterflies. 

Pombo is from Buenos Aires, 
Argenti na , and paints in geometric 
shapes, using deep contrasts and bright 

color. In his painting, "Figura Con Luna," 
the moon is almost blinding in its mes-
merizing, almost radioactive vibrance, 

Hartog struggles to capture "the fluid-
ity of the sky .. . the stability of the moun -
tains with manufactured materials that 
nevertheless behave in ways reminiscent 
of nature 's materials." Her 3-D approach 
to landscape preserves the flowing line 
and aesthetic inexactness of the Chinese 
masters she imitates, and yet allows a pre-
viously flat and detached environment to 
finally come to life.

Whole new ocean: Several patrons 
admire the painting 'Water Mural VII" 
by Leigh Li-Yun Wen at the opening 
reception of the new University Art 
Gallery exhibit on Oct. '24,2002. 

Flight of fancy: Another art fan looks 
intently at the canvas of a painting of 
another worldly artist at the reception 
of the exhibit "Representing 
Landscape." 

Yek's work is heavily modern and 
abstract, but is said to be reminiscent of a 
portal-like structure. 

He states that he wants his paintings to 
"have magic so that romance can happen, 
so that people will feel good." 

The exhibit is nothing shon of breath -
taking - art as it should be, a journey, 
feeding the hunger of the mind, giving 
serenity to the body, " Representing 
Landscape" will be on display untill Dec. 
26, Museum hours are II a.m, to 4 p.m, 
Tuesday through Saturday.

Fighting the good

Woman-oriented film festival 
LU NAFEST to benefit breast

By GAELLE FAURE 

Staff Writer 

Back in town for its second year o f nation -wide touring, the LUNAFEST film festi -val will be coming to the Forum ;\1 the 
University of San Diego on , ov. 7 for an 
evening projection of six shorr films by, for and 
about women. The festival , a product of parr-
nership between The Breast Cancer Fund and 
Clif Bar Inc., makers of LUNA bar, was creat-
ed with a threefold purpose in mind: to enter-
tain, to promote up-and-coming woman film-
makers and to help the breast cancer cause, 
with all proceeds goi ng to The Breast aneer 
Fund . 

LUNAFEST: 
"Breast cancer is the most 

commonly diagnosed cance1" in 
women worldwide. " 

"vVe thought that a fi lm festival was a !: r ~;J t 
way to give women filmmakers an opportlllll ry 
in a business where they are widely underrcp-
resented, as well as to create a dialogue 1011 
issues concerning women]," said Dean Mayer, 
a spokesman for LUNAFEST. 

Clif Bar Inc. has been partnerin g wit h the 
fund year-round since the inception of the 
LUNA bar in many ways o th er thJn 
Lunafest. In addition to providing sign ifi ca nt 
fin ancial suppo rt, the company al so prints 
the fund's logo and Web si te address on each 
LUNA bar wrapper, as well as prOlllotes and 
provides support for hikers in the fund '~

which hikers literally climb mountain> to 
symbolically represent the struggles of peo-
ple whom breast ca ncer. 

"Breast cancer is an issue that hits home fo r 
many of us," Mayer said , 

Gary Erikson, CEO of Clif Bar Inc. , i, the 
son of a breas t cancer survivor, and many of 
the other employees have been in ome W:ly 
effec ted by breast ca ncer, accordin g to 
Mayer. 

Breast cancer is the most comm nly diag-
nosed cancer in women worldwide. and is the 
No. 1 killer of women ages 34 to 54; howevcr. 
it also affects younger women. 

"[Breast cancerl hits women o f 311 Jge ," 
Mayer said. "A lot of young women think It 's 
nothing for them to worry about, so we ;Ire

LUNAFEST 2002 provides flavorful food for feminist 
A feast for all the senses: female filmmakers deliver short films for 
all cinematic tastes, from educational to humorous to outlandish. 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Seinor Staff Writer 

Each year, the minds behind LemonZest and 
Chai Tea LUNA Bars (energy bars vi tamin-engi-
neered for women) sponsor the LUNAFEST 
film festival, in which femme filmmakers from 
around the world send their cinematic shorts to 
be considered by the energy bar goddess. 

This fun-fest is a feast for everyone - this is 
not just a girls' club. To see something different 
from the usual movie blockbusters, get tickets to 
the rockin' Lunafest. 

The newest edition of LUNAFEST has six 
features, each an entirely different package from 
the next. 

"GrrlyShow." directed by Kara H erold, 
should be shown in every communications class 
on campus. Herold interviews the bigwigs of the 
real-world girl 'zine scene, and juxtaposes these 
ultra-cool publishing ladies against spoof scenar-
ios of women in the 1950s that want to start their 
own 'zine. This feature is an inside look, a how-
to and a sweet documenrary. 

"Really, we just make this stuff for us ... it 's 
not a big money-making venture," said Debbie 
Stoller, publisher of Bust 'zine. "We have got to 
stay true to our mission ." 

"J aney Van Winkle" is a twist on the classic 
story - in this case. Janey wakes up to find that 
li fe has marched on despite her comatose state. 

Yes. she 's a vegetable for seven years, but her 
parents still manage to marry her off and get 
grandchildren . 

"It's really a sha me," Janey's mother says, to 
Janey's horror and disgust . "Everyone should 
remember their wedding day." 

Director Casey Suchan makes this story 
nightmarishly scary and hilariously funny at the 
same time. What could be better than a wedding 
picture in which J aney is propped up and drool-
ing, obviously out cold? Not much. 

Aminah Bakeer Abdul-Jabbar directed 
"Personal Touch," a naked look at breast cancer. 
It's powerful ye t difficult to watch; the four-
minute running time was a good call. 

"Psalm 51," filmed in black and white, uses an 
increasingly frenzied soundtrack and improvisa-
tional dance to portray themes of sin, despair and 
hope without words. If director Kris Barberg 
delivers a message that's too abstract for yO\!, 
look for the dancer in the film: She is astound-
ing.

Dance rehearsals: Several UCSD ballet dance students practice their new 
dance moves which will be featured at the Nov. Bth and Nov. 9th cabaret show. 

From elegant to techno, cabaret 
show will feature UCSD talent 

What has traditionally been associated with bal-
let meets the modern and new in UCSD show 

By USAMAK 
Staff Writer 

A group of UCSD ballet dancers will be performing at a free cabaret show at 8 p.m. 
on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 in Studio 3 of 
the Wagner Dance Building. 
Directed by UCSD students Leigh 
Schanfein and Kathryn Dickason, 
the cabaret performance will fea-
ture various ballet selections, rang-
ing from elegant classical works to 
exhilarating techno-ballet. 

According to Schanfein, who is 
a sophomore at Earl Warren 
College, the program will consist 
of six dances, with a group of eight 
girls performing. 

There will be classical reper-
toire from "Le Corsaire," where 

three girl s will first dance together, 
then on separate variations, with a 
coda following. The techno-ballet 
dance will be performed to Mauro 
Picotto's ~Omodo." 

The program will also feature 
variations of other famous ballets, 
such as "The Sleeping Beauty" and 
"The Nutcracker." J amie Franz. a 
Thurgood Marshall College junior, 
will be performing a solo dance, 
"the Sugarrum Cherry," which is a 
variation of "The Sugarplum 
Fairy." 

One noteworthy aspect of the 
cabaret show is the choreography. 
Schanfein and Dickason choreo-
graphed a majority of the dances 
themselves and taught them to the

Boubacar captures Mali's blues 
The artist behind IIMaii Twist" comes to Mandeville 

By ANNA DYLEWSKA 
Contributing writer 

When you think of blues mll5ic, the names of classical 
performers like Johnny Lee 
Hooker, B.B. King, Chuck 
Berry and Stevie Ray 
Vaughan may pop into your 
head. It is also possible that 
you ma y draw a parallel to 
contemporary bluesy artists 
like Johnny Lang. However, 
you most likel y will not 
recall the name Boubacar 
Traon: , even though his . 
music captures and focuses 
on a fundamental aspect of 
blues, namely its soul. 

Traore was born and 
raised in Kayes, Mali, where 
he became a local soccer star 
in school and earned the 
nickname Kar Kar, which 
means "the one who dribbles 
too much" in Bambara. 
During his early years, he 
taught himself music and 
started to compose tunes 
that were highly influenced 
by both American blues and 
kassonke, a type of tradition-
al chant from the Kayes' 
region. He also picked up 
some tips and learned how to 
play gui tar from his older 
brother, who spent eight 
years in Cuba studying 
music. 

Throughout the '60s, 
Traore's music gained accep-
tance in Mali, and his songs 
were constantly played on 
the radio. He performed in 
clubs where audiences would 
dance to his songs and call 
him by his nickname, Kar 
Kar. His tunes, like "Kar Kar 
Madison" and "Kayes Ba, "

Soul Artist: The bluesy recording artist, known to many fans as 
Kar Kar, has inspired many of the citizens of the nowÂ·free Mali. 
inspired and touched the 
people of the newly indepen-
dent country of Mali . In 
1963, Traore's biggest hit, 
"Mali Twist," served as a 
kind of national anthem. 
H owever, this facade of 
grand success hid the fact 
that in reality, despite all the 
recognition, Traore had a 
hard time supporti ng him-
self. To earn a living, Traon: 
dropped out of sight by tak-
ing on various jobs like a tai-
lor, salesman and shopkeep-

er during the day, and train-
ing orchestras or performing 
to a close group of friends at 
night. 

In 1987, Traore reap-
peared on stage after being 
invited to play for Malian 
Tv: His rcsurrection came 
as a shock to many people 
that mistook him for his 
brother, who had died a few 
years earlier. Two years after 
Traore's reemergence, the

Eminem shows off his acting chops 
Surprisingly good performance by rap's most controversial star 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

"8 ,\Iil e" has created more 
bun across the nation in 
lhe past few weeks than 

Emll1elll ', huber's shears. With a 
cast that will pull in every demo-
graphiC Out there, rest assured tha t 
"8 ,'.li le" IS going to be huge. The 
old fo lks can always say they were 
just checkIng out Kim Ba inger'S 
performance , the 7 million plus 
who bought Eminem's album are 
sure to show, and the entire h.ip-
hop wnrld is going to come out to 
see this one, whether it's to decide 
if the rapping battle scenes are 
legit or see XZlbit's cameo. The 
big question that remains is: Does 
this tilm deserve all the attention 
it is sure to receive? 

The answer is a surprising yes. 
This film bucks everything that 
has daunted previous rapper acting 
attempts. First and foremost, "8 
Mile" gave Eminem a role that he 
could handle, simply because he's 
playing himself. While Eminem 
ceases to be the person America 
has grown to love/hate/feel sorry 
for, he stops there; Eminem carries 
the film , but doesn't make the film 
ensational. Feel free to dismiss 

any discussion you hear of the 
word "Oscar." 

The filmmakers also gave the 
film a true and gritty feel. The 
film is set in the ghetto of Detroit, 
where Emmem actually grew up. 
The city served up a portion of 
truc ghetto life, no Hollywood 
added. T he film's artistic ele-
ments were superb, from sound-
track to ci nematogr,lphy, and the 
mood of the fi I m stayed true to the 
subject matter. 

The real- life feel tllat the "8 
Mile" team hoped to bring to the 
film wa exemplified in Enimem's 
sex scene with Brittany Murphy's 
cha racter, which lasts a good 
minute and a half. This film does 
for Detroit and the rap communi-
ty what "Good Will Hunting" did 

Photo CU"esv of Unillersal Pictures 
Staring Hard: Eminem stares on amid his co-stars, while his film continues to 
create increasing buzz from the media and fans. '8 Mile' has been well 
received despite worries about of the rapper's ability outside of rap. 

Film 
REVIEW 

for Boston and intellectuals. "8 
Mile" successfully gives an authen-
tic feel for a small geographic loca-
tion rather than watering down 
elements of the Detroit scene that 
outsiders might not wlderstand. 

It 's possible that the film's 
intense focus on providing that 
true-life tone comes at the cost of 
the film not having a real message. 
"8 Mile" feels almost more like a 
documentary than a movie 
because the plot doesn't really do 
anything more than tell Eminem's 
story - which would be fine, 
except that it i n't rea lly Eminem's 
story. And while most biographi-
cal films manage to squeeze out 
some son of message, the fact that 
"8 Mile" didn't have to stick strict-
ly to Eminem's biography meant 
that this film should have had 
something beneath the surface. 

However, the film does manage 
to entertain, with great perfor-
mances by Melchi Pheifer and Evan 

Jones, who help provide some of 
the film's heaviest and most light-
hearted moments. Basinger offers 
up what is undoubtedly the most 
unattractive performance of her 
career, though Rabbit's (Eminem's) 
on-screen peers seemed to dis-
agree, with a number of "yo mama" 
references scattered throughout 
the film. Basinger provided the 
film's low point by describing her 
sex life to her son the way only a 
trailer-park woman could. Murphy 
and Taryn Manning both look 
good on screen, but serve no other 
rcal purpose in the film except to 
help paint the desolate picture that 
surrounds Eminem's character. 

T his movie is sure to bolster 
the sales and reputation of a man 
who is already America's most 
undeserving bad-boy sweetheart.

'The dancehall reggae of Eek-A-
Mouse comes to Porter's Pub 

The second of this year's Buzz concert series 
features a phenomenal reggae legend 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Contributing Writer 

O ancehall reggae legend Eek-A-Mouse will bring the sounds of modern Jamaica to Porter's 
Pub on Nov. 8 for the second 
installment of A.S. Programming's 
The Buzz concert series. 

Renowned both for his enter-
taining stage antics and his lmique 
lyrical approach, Eek-A-Mouse has 
remained one of the most innova-
tive Jamaican DJs in the dancehall 
scene since the early '80s. While his 
often-humorous songs and wild 
delivery have scored him numerous 
hits in Jamaica and the United 
Kingdom over the years, Eek-A-
Mouse is best known and most 
respected for crafting the wholly 
original vocal styling known as 
"sing-jay." 

A combination of roots reggae 
singing and toasting (a uniquely 
Jamaican form of dee-jaying char-
acterized by syllabically charged 
vocal sound effects such as, in Eek's 
case, "Biddy biddy beng"), sing-jay 
greatly influenced Jamaican dance-
hall's best in the '80s lind many of 
its stylistic elements were adopted 
into mainstream music overseas. 

Born Ripton Hylton in the 
Kingston, Jamaica , ghetto of 
Trench Town, Eek cut his first 

records in the mid- '70s at the age 
of 17. However, it was not until hi~ 
1981 "Wa Do Oem r release and 
walk-on performance at j:l1naica 's 
Reggae Sunsplash Festival that 
same yea r that Eek placed himself 
on the dancehall map. Since then , 
he has released almost a dozen 
album , the latest of which being 
2002's "Eeksperience," and has 
toured tltroughout the world, per-
forming an impressive 150 to 200 
shows each year. 

Eek's live performances are 
often visual and aural spectacles. At 
6 feet 6 inches ta ll and often decked 
in ridiculous costumes, Eek com-
mands a striki ng stage presence, 
and his shows are considered outra-
geous even for a dancehall , a regu-
larly madcap genre. 

"Eek-A-Mouse put on a good 
show when I saw him at a reggae 
festival in Long Beach," sa id 
sophomore Marc Costa. "So I'm 
excited to see him in a smaller place 
where he can do whatever he 
wants." 

San Diego hip-hop act the Icons 
will open the Nov. 8 concert at 7 
p.m. Tickets are available at the 
UCSD box office or at any 
Ticketmaster outlet for S8 (UCSD 
students) and S I 0 (general admis-
sion). Must be 18 or older with a

New film is decent attempt at the life of 'Frida' 
Great acting is plentiful but sadly the artistic visions are neglected 

By CHARLIE TRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

"F rida" is similar to a survey 
course as opposed to an 
upper-division class: It ill us-

[fates generalities but never manages 
to get into the meaty details. 
Director JuJie Taymor's biopic of 
famed Mexican artist Frida 1<..,hlo 
explores the ups and downs of her 
tumultuous life, from her vivid sexu-
ality to her progressive politics to 
her unique paintings, but tile audi-
ence can't really tell what I<nhlo 
(Salma Hayek) i truly feeling. 

I<nhlo's li fe is expressed through 
her pantings, which often have a 
sad, depressing tone that match the 
isolation she felt throughout her 
life. She dealt with a catastrophic 
spine injury in a bus accident as a 
teen, and her injuries continued to 
haunt her throughout the rest of 
her life. Kahlo meets and falls in 
love with fellow anist Diego Rivera 
(Alfred Molina), despite his ten-
dencies toward philandering. 

The film chroni cles all the 
major points of Kahlo ' li fe, but it 

doesn't focus on what spawned her 
artistic vision. In fact, the film rais-
es more questions than it answers. 

Hayek docs an admirable job of 
porrraying Kahlo, and even dons a 
unibrow - a trademark of I<nhJo 
- to capture her character. 
Th.roughout her life, Kahlo dealt 
with an endless amount of tragedies 
that cou ld tip anyone over into tlle 
side of madness. Hayek is able to 
not onJy reflect upon those adversi-
ties, but to also bring a fierce , fiery 
self-independence to Kahlo that 
seems to sui t her real life paintings. 

Taymor is famous for bringing 
"The Lion King" to Broadway with 
her artistry and visual flair for pup-
petry. In the case of "Frida," she is 
able to merge the artistry of Kahlo 
into the film with ease and perfect 
harmony. The fil m is a showcase of 
I<nhJo's work, and Taymor does 
more than just capture her artwork 
on film; she uses computer effects 
to blend both work and li fe into 
synchronous scenes. 

Several other scenes en pture 
Taymor's arti stic vision well, espe-
cia lly the scene depicting doctors 

Film 
REVIEW 

operating on Kahlo after her horrif-
ic accident. Forget an image of 
physicians rushing to KahJo's aid; 
imagine a twisted, claynlation scene 
of haunting skeletons working on 
I<nhlo at the hospital and you'll get a 
sense of what Taymor's abilities are. 

Despite the good use of artistry, 
"Frida" is a decent fi lm about what 
was an extraordinary life. But ulti-
mately, it doesn't discover the true 
life of Kahlo and her chi lling paint-
ings.

summoned him to record two new 
albums, UMariama" and UI<nr KaT." 
This meeting gave TraoT(!'s career a 
necessary boost. He toured in 
England, Switterland and Canada, 
and played a single show in the 
United States. Eventually he 
recorded three more records, 
including "Les Enfants de 

Pierette," "Sa Golo" and "Macire." 
WI th his eclectic history and 

impeccable sense of rhythm, 
Traore is the ideal storyteller to 
convey the hopes and fears of his 
country in meaningful songs. Jon 
Pareles, a reviewer for Tht Nf'W 
York Times, described TraoTl:'s 
music as "swinging and hypnotic, 
doleful and soothing, rooted and 
personal , as it transmuted basic ele-
ments into profound incantations." 
Cathy Ragland from The Searrle 
Times depicts his music as "inviting 
and warm, not overwhelming." 

Traore does not pl ay blues 
music in the traditional sense. 
Instead, his style of Mali blues 

incorporates deep emotion 
through an ideal correlation 
between vocals and guitar. He 
sings about political issues, love 
and da ily concerns like fear. He 
fluctuates between songs that 
exhibit a Spanish influence, like 
"Courir Un Homme Qui Vous 
Aime," some that inhabit some 
inspiration from American pop, 
and others that are pure bluesy 
acoustic guitar and voiee numbers. 
"Les Enfants de Pierette" is 
Traon:\; tribute to his wife and 
children, and is sure to evoke an 
emotional response. Even though

Sexy humor marks 'Amy's Orgasm' 
Dilemma of the 21 st century woman are at their funniest 

By CUNTON HAYCRAFT 
Contributing Writer 

I n "Amy's Orgasm," Amy Mandell Oulie Davis) has written a best-selling self-help book titled "Love Doesn't Work," stating 
thar women do not need men or sex to feel 
complete. But when she falls for radio shock-
jock i\1atthew Starr (Nick ChinJund), all her 
aphoristic advice tlies out the window, and she 
hegins livi ng a lie. She neurotically confides in 

h~r conrrolling, lesbia n publ icist, Janet 
(Caroline Aaron), her happily married friends 
Don and Elizabeth (Mitchell Whitfield and 
Jelmifer Bransford), and , despite the fact that 
Amy isJewish, a Catholic priest Oeff Cesario). 

"Amys Orgasm " sardonically addresses the 
dilemma of the postfeminist, heterosexual 
woman of the 2 1st cennlry. The film ultimate-
ly throws all feminist assertions out the win-
dow because this icon of feminine strength and 
independence gives in to her repressed need 
for a man in her life. Even more than this, she 
d es it for the epitome of the male pig, whose 
character bears an lmdeniable resemblance to 
Howard Stern. Yes, feminists might not enjoy 
the rrajectoty that their hopeful takes in this 
film . But they _viII also have a hard time not 
sympathizing with her, even growing to love 
her III her struggle, since she is attractive, intel-
ligent, funny and - like any human being-
in search of the ulomare orgasm, or the "men-

REVIEW 

tal orgasm," as she calls it, which is none other 
than love. 

T he format and subject matter of the fi lm 
are very much like t11at of "Sex and the City." 
Davis (star/writer/director/ producer/editor) 
takes a candid look at a modern 'woman 's most 
intimate moments and thoughts - so candid , 
sometimes, that one might feel slightly embar-
rassed. After only three films (UI Love You, 
Don't Touch Me!" and "AllOver the G uy''), 
Davis has received great accla im, being 
deemed "the female Woody Allen," and for 
good reason, too. Perhaps the only drawback 
would be that between Amy's neurotic on-
screen dialogue and off-screen narration, there 
is sometimes little time for moments to sink in. 
This is essential to the character's rhythm, but 
can become tedious.

Blues: Influences from spanish 
and pop combine in catchy blues 

contin~d [rom page 13 
Traore mostly sings in French or in his 
native Mali tongue, his music is expressive 
enough to narrate the tales purely through 
the musical notes. 

Traore is currently on his first North 

American tour and is coming to perform at 
UCSD on Nov. 8. You can experience liJr 
yourself the emotion of this compelling 
performer at 7:30 p.m. at Mandevill e 
Auditorium. Tickets are $15 for students 
and $20 for general admission . 

Cabaret: A rare enthusiasm and 
beauty promises to be infectious 

cominued [rom page 10 
oth er dancers . Among others, Schan fein 
choreographed the techno-ballet dance 
and Dickason choreographed "The 
Sugarrum Cherry" variation . 

"Cathryn and I like to choreograph, so 
we wanted some outlet because otherwise, 
[dances] just stay in your head and you 
never really get to fully explore what you've 
been thi nking about for so long," 
Schanfein said . 

Although the group has only had rour 
rehearsals, they seem to be enthusiastic 
and excited about the upcomi ng perfor-
mance. 

"You get a real rush out of performing," 
said Lynn Eva ns, a fifth-year graduate stu-
dent who is studying in the Neuroscience 
Program at the UCS D medical school. 
"Even though the rehearsals can be diffi -

cult and exhausting, it's still worth it when 
you get that high after performing." 

Evans said that she thinks this produc-
tion has a lot to offer. 

"Leigh's a grea t choreographer, and 
there are a lot of good ballerinas," Evans 
said . 

Schanfein and Dickason organized the 
cabaret in an effort to allow dancers to per-
form this quarter. They posted fliers a fcw 
weeks ago, inviting dancers to participate 
in the performance. 

"In the fa ll quarter, there aren't any per-
forming opportuni ties for dancers here ar 
school, so we wanted to do something dur-
ing fall quarter just to perform," Schanfein 
sa id. 

Doors will open for the performances at 
7:3 0 p.m. For further information, please 
contact Schanfein at lJ"cbanfe@uml.fl/lt.

Playoffs: 
Team plays 
without any 

pressure 
cominued from page 20 

The Tritons have been prepar -
ing for this meeting. 

"We've been having practice 
las usualJ, but we 've stepped it up 
a bit," said UCS D head coach 
Derek Armstrong. " \Ne've been 
doing some more running, and we 
played a crim mage game. [Nov. 
8's game] is goi ng to be a tough 
job." 

Just like th e Toros, the li-itons 
also finished their season strong, 
wi ll11ing five of the last six games, 
and gaining a spot in the playoffs 
by winning their last three do-or-
die games. 

Forward T iago Venturi, who 
earned CCAA Player of the Week 
ho nors, lea ds the team in scoring 
with eight goals and three assists 
entering the tournament, followed 
by mid fielder Matthew Davey with 
six goal and three assists, and for -
ward Bobby Sadaati with five goals 
and t11ree assists. Goa li e Jeremy 
Cookson ente rs with a 1.41 goals 
allowed ave rage and a .7 18 save 
percentage in 16 games. 

Although C UDH is the top 
ced and holds the No.6 ranking 

in NCAA Division II , the Tritons 
welcome bei ng the underdog. 

" l don't feci like there's too 
much pressure on us," aid Triton 
co-captain Kris Chiles. "We arc in 
a good position because we are the 
underdog. We have nothing to 
lose, and no o ne is expecting US to 
do anything." 

T he team left for Sonoma tate 
on Nov. 6 and will begin play on 

ov. 8 at 11 a.m. If the Trito ns 
advance past the Toros , they wi ll 
play the champion hip game on 
Nov. 10.

The women's team took lOth

that the com petition consisted

His music is swinging and hypnotic, doleful and soothing, rooted and personal . it's the 
blut!s! Though not wellÂ·known in the United States, Malian guitarist and vocalist Boubacar 
Traore, known by fans as Kar Kar, is a legendary figure in his homeland. Considered the 
father of the blues scene in Ma li, his first hit 'Malian Twist" made him a music idol for the 
whole west coast of Africa and became the unofficial national anthem following Mali 's 
independence in the 1960$, He sings with a kindly voice touched with a mournful 
undercurrent and accompanied only by his guitar and the tapping of a calabash perCUSSionist.

tnee meet , both sq uads fell to sixth in 
the region. 

The women's team was ranked 16th 
in the nation before the last meet, but 
they fell out of the rankings the fol-
lowing week . 

"We had a couple of key people have 
bad races," said women's rUllner Audrey 
Sung. "We were a linle bit intimated 
heading into it, but we've been working 
on our confidence and getting people 
healthy." 

Sung was one of the top performers, 
finishi ng second overall with the fastest 
6K women's race in UCSD history at 
21 :21.27. Sung earned A11-CCAA hon-
ors, which is awarded to the top 15 run-
ners in each race, for her second con-
secutive year. 

Following Sung was Lillian 

O'Donnell (38th). 
UCSD 's Neil Kalra became the 

first A11-CCM runner for the men's 
team since J ames Nielsen won consec-
utive conference titles in 1999 by fin-
ishing 10th out of 49 runners with a 
time of25 :30.39. 

Carl Lostrom finished just behind 
Kalra in 16th place wim a time of 
25 :58.50. Following Lostrom and 
Kalra were Tov Fisher-Kirshner 
(20th), David Dunbar (23 rd), John 
Morrison (24th), Alan Shapiro (2 Sth) 
and Devin Callister (29th), rounding 
out UCSD's top seven.

Last year, the UCSD wom en's team 

ended its season after finishing 12th at 
the regional meet and taking fifth 
place at the conference champi-
onships. 

The Triton men's team made a 
deeper postseason push, however, fin-
ishing third at the conference meet, 
fourth at the regionals and 15 th over-
all at nationals. 

To continue their season, the 
Tritons will need to return to their 
preconference form, where they were 
ranked third behind Chico State and 
UC Davis, because the West Region 
already gave up its fourth qualification 
spot.

of 22: 14.04; Meghan Bellotti (27th); 
Lindsay Stalker (3 1 st); Kara Cross 
(35th); Mimi Hodgins (37th); and Erin 

Chico State won both conference 
races at the CCM Championships, 
ending UC Davis's four-year champi-
onship reign on both men's and 
women's sides. Cal State Stanislaus 
finished third in the women's race and 
moved up one spot from fifth to fourth 
in the West Region rankings. Cal Poly 
Pomona finished thi rd on the men 's 
side and remained ranked fifth in the 

"We just need to race how we 've 
been training," Sung said. "We need 
everyone to step up and have a good 
race. We don't need to do anytlling 
extraordinary or miraculous. We don't 
need to do anything new. We JUSt need 
to go out there and do it."

Tritons play Torosin semifinal 
Women's soccer will be tested early 

UCSD 
seeks top.., 

three finish ByANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team may not have reached the 
championship form that it had 
in the three previous years by 
tbe end of the 2002 regular sea-
son, but the Tritons still man-
aged to finish in first place in 
the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association South 
Division. 

After closing the season 6-0-
I in its last seven games, UCSD 
has some momennun on its side 
when the CCM 
Championships begin Nov. 7 at 
Sonoma State's Seawolf Field. 
The Tritons will open against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills in a 
game that UCSD head coach 
Brian McManus hopes tQ see 
end in a fashion similar to what 
he has been witnessing in recent 
weeks. 

""Ve're not playing particu-
larly well," McManus said. "But 
we have been battling and get-
ting results." 

CSUDH, which finished the 
regular season 11-6-3, is 4-1 in 
its last five games, and the Toros 
are riding a three-game winning 
strealc heading into the postsea-
son. They should prove to be a 

respectable opponent for 
UCSD in the teams' semifinal 
game. 

The Tritons and CSUDH 
match up evenly against each 
other, as evidenced by the Sept. 
29 game in Carson, Calif . . In 
the match, UCSD fell behind 
in the first half, but tied the 

ga.me on a goal by junior rnid-
fielder Kristin Conahan in the 
middle of the second half The 
Tritons finally put the game 
away and rook the victory in 
overtime when junior forward 
Kristin Jones lobbed the ball

Men head to playoffs for second time ever 
Soccer team will face CSUDH in the semifinal round 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Contributing Writer 

Although the UCSD men's 
soccer team has only been in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association since 2000, it has 
made its presence known. After 
a spectacular finish this season, 
the Tritons (11-5) earned their 
second berth ever in the play-
offs. 

The Tritons will travel north 
to Rohnert Park, Calif., where 
North Division champion 
Sonoma State University will 
play host to this year~ CCAA 
playoffs, to face Cal State 
Domingue7, Hills on Nov. 8. 

UCSD will play the first 
semifinal match of the playoffs 

against the Toros, who are 
ranked sixth in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division 11 polls and are the 
Central Division winners: with a 
16-3-1 record. The Toros 
secured the t.op seed in the play-
offs after beating Cal Stare 
Bakersfield and Cal State Los 
Angeles in their final games of 
the season, while the Tritons 
took the third seed by winning 
their final three games and tak. 
ing first place in the South 
Divjsion.

Crew participate in first two events of the year 
UCSD starts season with first ever Row for the Cure 

By MARK mCKEL 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's and women's 
crews hosted the first ever Row for 
the Cure on Oct. 27 at Mission Bay, 
Calif., in what was the first race of 
the season for both UCSD teams. 
Proceeds from the race benefited 
the Susan G . Komen Foundation, 
an organization created to eradi-
cate breast cancer by advancing 
research, education, screening and 
treatment. 

The race is one of only a hand-
ful across the country. According to 
UCSD women's crew coach Pattie 

Pinkerton, the crews in the past 
have been unable to participate in 
the Race for the Cure due to sched-
uling conflicts with other crew 
events. The teams decided to take 
the race to the water, as rowing 
clubs in other parts of the country 
have done. UCSD is the first colle-
giate program to host a Row for the 
Cure. 

Teams that participated in the 
event included UCSD, University 
of San Diego, Chapman 
University, San Diego Rowing 
Club, ZLAC Rowing Club, 
Mission Bay Racing Team and a 
handful of kayakers from the 

Olympic Training Center. 
Against cross-town rival USD, 

the UCSD boats came in very 
close, finishing second overall. 

"We finished just six seconds 
behind USD," Pinkerton said. "It 
was a very, very close race. We're 
really pleased with where we're at." 

In addition to providing spirit-
ed competition between the 
teams, the Row for the Cure also 
raised over $10,000 for the 
Komen Foundation. The money, 
raised through entry fees and 
pledges, will be given to the San 
Diego chapter of the Komen 
Foundation, with 75 percent of 

the proceeds staying in the local 
community to fund education, 
screening and treatment. The rest 
of the earnings will fund breast 
cancer research. 

Following the race, an eight-
boat dedication recognized Lori 
Ann Uptegrove, a UCSD couwain 
from 1979 to 1982, who suc-
cumbed to breast cancer several 
months ago. Uptegrove was 
coxswain for the UCSD light-
weight eight, which won a U.S. 
Rowing Association National 
Championship.

Golf team 
struggles in 
tournament 

Second day 
proves costly 
for Tritons 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD participated in T he 
Prestige at the Pro Golf 
Association West competition 
on Nov. 4 and Nov. 5, and the 
Tritons finished 17th out of 18 
teams amid stiff competition. 
The tournament was co-hosted 
by UC Davis and Stanford 
University with the intent of 
bringing together some of the 
nation 's top academic universi -
ties, and it is held at the chal-
lenging La Quinta course in 
Palm Desert, Calif. 

"La Quinta is really a great 
golf course," said UCSD head 
coach Mike Wydra . "It's ranked 
in the top 50 of the U.S . It's 
rea lly just fantastically difficult, 
and we all had a great time play-
ing it." 

Texas Christian University 
took the lead early in the tour-
nament and never gave it up, 
coming in first place by 15 
strokes with an II -under-par 
finish at 853 , the only team to 
finish under par in the tourna-
ment. TCU had the lowest 
scoring rounds in both the first 
and third rounds, at 284 and 
282, respectively, and only 
Pepperdine University beat it in 
the second round , as TCU 
turned in a 286. 

UC Irvine, Pepperdine , 
UCLA and Vanderbilt 
University rounded out the top 
five, posting scores of 868, 873, 
877 and 880, respectively. These 
teams also each yielded a top 10 
finisher. 

University of Kansas and 
University of Washington tied 
for sixth place with scores of 
882, and UC Davis, University 
of San Diego and University of 
Oregon finished in the eighth 
through 10th positions with 
scores of 886, 891 and 894, 
respectively. 

Kansas' Chris Marshall took 
first place in the tournament 
overall, with a 9-under-par 
score of 207, shooting a 67 in 
the second round, the lowest 
round score in the competition. 

Stanford and University of 
the Pacific took 11th and 12th 
with respective scores of 899 
and 901, while Rice and Yale 
University tied for 13th with 
scores of 902. University of 
Colorado took 15th with a score 
of 904, and UC Santa Barbara 
came in 16th with 922. UCSD 
finished in 17th with a score of 
925, and Air Force rounded out 
the group in 18th with a score of 
934. 

Individually, the Tritons 
posted strong first-round 
results, but suffered heavily on 
the second day. This can be 
partially attributed to the fact 
that darkness shortened the 
first day of tournament play 
and cut many golfers' second 
rounds short. This forced them 
to begin mid-round on the sec-
ond day, throwing off their 
rhythm. 

Finishing first among 
UCSD's five golfers was junior 
Alan Scheer, who tied for 52nd
