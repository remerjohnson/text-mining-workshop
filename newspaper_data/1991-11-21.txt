Coops Given Deadline on Financial Future 
• Groundwork Books' move to ofJ-campus payroll 
account forces it into autonomy, Carruthers says 
By ...... PoruIh 
Guatdlan Reporter 

The future of the UCSD Food 
Co-op, General Store, Che Cafe, 
and Groundwode Books may be 
threatened by two administrative 
decisions presented to the Univer-
sity Center Board (VCB) at their 
meeting Monday evening. 

University Center Director Jim 

co.oPS: First in a two-part 
series on the future of UCSO's 

student cooperatives 

benefits. 
All of the co-ops will be audited 

30 days from now. 
The action against the co-ops 

was taken in response to the co-ops' 
alleged violations of Policy and Pr0-
cedure Manual (pPM) regulation , 
including alleged unsound bu ine s 
practice . 

As an auxiliary account, the co-
ops would no longer be completely 
student-run. Instead, they would be 
obligared to give their checkbooks, 
accounts and all bookkeeping to the 
university accounting office, said 
Kelly Harrington, Groundwork 
Books Co-op member. 

Carruthers announced that Ground-
wode Books will now be considered 
autonomous due to a recent deci-
sion not to operate its payroll sys-
tern through the university. 

In return, they would continue to 
receive financial support from the 
university, called the financial um-
brella, in the form of discounts on 
rental space, utilities, liability and 
payroll processing fees. 

Groundwork Books may now have to bid against commercial vendors for 
a shop space in the Student Center.

Groundwode Books, in response, 
contends that it was not properly 
informed of the possible change of 
status which would result if the de-
cision were made. 

In addition, Carruthers an-
nounced that UCSD student co-ops 
will be given 90 days to decide 
whether they will become a UCSD 
auxiliary account and therefore lose 
fmancial control, or whether they 
will become an autonomous, out-
side vendor, and lose all university 

As an autonomous entity, the co-
ops would become outside vendors 
and would have to bid against com-
mercial vendors - possibly major 
chain stores and restaurants - for 
space in the Student Center. They 
would also lose the university's fi-
nancial umbrella, said Jeff Corbett. 
General Store Co-op manager.

Cafe have their own checkbook ac- umbrella. Carruthers and Business 
counts. but co-op • payrolls go 
through the university and are later 
repaid by the co-ops. 

Groundwode Books is in conflict 
with the administration over the 
store's future financial status and 
ability to stay in the Student Center. 

Manager Cammy Rice said the ad-
mini tration views this as a final-
ized decision. with no room for 
negotiation.

New UCSD Association to Provide 
'Safe Environment' for Staff, Faculty 
• Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Staff and Faculty Association members'in the 
process of developing the organization after receiving university approval 
ByD .. Kr..a 
Staff Writer 

Lesbian. gay and bisexual staff and faculty 
members at UCSD who feel alienated in their 
wode environment now have a place to turn 
where they will be welcomed and supported by 
others in similar situations. 

The newly-formed Lesbian. Gay & Bisexual 
Faculty and Staff Association (LGBFSA) hopes 
to offer a positive environment for gay and 
lesbian wodeers at UCSD who may feel that they 
are alone and need an outlet to voice their 
concerns. 

According to the LGBFSA's stated mission, 
the group will create it mutually supportive 
environment at UCSD. fostering open commu-
nication, social interaction and recognition of 

contributions to the UCSD community by its 
lesbian, gay and bisexual faculty and staff. 

The organization will provide opportunitie 
to educate the UCSD community about lesbian, 
gay and bisexual culture, ethniciry, diversity and 
other issues of concern. 

Additionally, LGBFSA will facilitate the 
development and possible change of university 
policies and procedures that are relevant to 
lesbian. gay and bisexual faculty and staff. 

Since theLGBFSA' s formation was approved 
in July. the group has had two meetings. and is 
70 members strong. According to Ben Freeman. 
acting secretary of the LGBFSA and a study co-
ordinator at the Department of Medicine. the 
meetings have mainly focused on organizing

P.A.L Helps UCSD Students to Become Friends, Mentors 
• Third College requirement benefits college and elementary students 
By Anton BIttner 
SenIor St8ff Writer 

When first-grader Joseph Johnson sees 
Gibson Arnold, a UCSD student, walk into his 
classroom, he runs up and grabs Arnold's hand. 
Arnold, who is Johnson's individual tutor, is 
partofPartncrs at Leaming (p.A.L),aprogram 
starbld last year through Third College. 

PAL, or Teacher's Education Program 
(1EP)121, was created by Third College to 
help its students fulfiU a newly-added public 
servi<:e requirement, according to Third Col-
• Provost Cecil Lytle, who is presently on 
1IIbbIIicaI. 

Lytle said that in 1988, when plaMing for 
IbecoUnc and the requirement first began. only 
64 pen:ent of UCSD students ~ involved 
willi Ibe community. The pi in introducinS 

the requirement was to help Third College 
students make contact with the community at 
large. 

"Our feeling was that the university was not 
taking the responsibility of teaching students 
[about the community) ... we provide [aca-
demicJ courses, but do not provide a course for 
citizenship," Lytle said. 

"Third CoUege needed to be a part of the 
outside community," added Faustina Solfs, 
Third College actin.-provost. 

Both the UCSD students involved with 
P.AL. and their students areenthusiastic about 
the program. 

"Joseph teaches me through his enthusi-
asm. You forget how kids see the world, and 
this program lets you to see everything from 
their view," Arnold said. 

Rafael Hernandez 
Johnson said that Arnold makes doing 

homewode fun, by doing things like taking 
him to the park to do his homewodc.

ture of the violations until accusa-
tions have been made. However. 
bodlthe administraIion and the co-
ops did say that some of the p~ 
!ems included improper documen-
tation of checks and delayed sub-
mission of financial infonnation. 

Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson 
"We decided to have our payroU 

processed through lID outside ven-
dorto avoid any conttadictions with 
the cooperative goals of Ground-
wort that we have experienced in 
the past under the university pay-
roll." Harrington said. 

Hanington said that Ground-
work. Books was not informed until 
the Nov. 18 UCB ~ that by 
usil18 an outside vendor for payroll. 
it had re-defmed itself as an aut0no-
mous entity and would be treIIed as 
such from now on, withoutachance 
of negotiating its SlIdUs.. 

"As it stands right now. there is 
no way Groundwork can compete 
with commen:ial vendors for the 
space. This situation is comparable 
to the old Pub. We will be sold out 
to the highest bidder." she said. 

Another conflict exists between 
all of the co-ops and the administra-
tion. According to Carruthers. the 
administration has decided to take 
action against the co-ops due to 
"unsound business practices." 

Carruthers said he believes that 
because of the co-ops , alleged prac-
tices, there is no otherchoice except 
10 m1efine these co-ops as auxiliary 
accounts or autonomous entities. 

According to Carruthers. the ad-
ministralion sends ledgers with the 
co-ops' financial records to the c0-
ops, who then show proof in their 
dispenement joumaIs of all their 
expenditures. The journals include 
such infonnaaion a income state-
mcnIS, COlt of goods. rent and pay-
ron. It is general university practice 
for the university to receive timely 
fmancial information from campus 
businesses indispersementjoumals, 
Canwhen said. 

Carruthers added that the co-ops 
have a history of failure to submit 
this information in a timely manner. 

According to Rice. the account-
ing system switched to the inte-
grated Financial Infonnation Sys-
tem (IFIS) from the Burrows sys-
tem last July, causing all of the 
administnltive ledgers from July 
through October to be submitted to 
the co-ops \are. 

1bc:refore. according to Rice, it 
is understandable that the co-ops 
would be late in returning fUl8JlCial 
infonnation from July through Sqr 
tember to the university accounting 
office, but not the information 
pertaining to theJune ledgers. which 
wa sent to the co-ops on time. 

"We have demanded to see that 
information for the past three 
months. " said Carruthers.

COMMENTARIES 

II The university is the victim of the same 
reckless spending that has ruined California 
By Matthew RobIillOll 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Extraordinary times have befallen the 
state university system throughout 
California as a result of state-wide 
recession. 

So much so that last year UC students 
saw their fees rise by 40 percent and, more 
surprisingly, many programs were also 
sacrificed in order to maintain some 
semblance of fiscal sanity. 

Take a quick, discerning look around 
and one will notice that with SacramenlO 
S 14.3 billion in the hole, more cuas and 
more fee increases are on the way. 

In addition, there is the added dilemma 
that California might need to weather 
another $3 billion defiCit next year. 

With a linle considenuion, it SCCIm that 
the endeavor of the California stale system 
is beina threaIened by the general shortfall. 

But before you hans your bead in the

GARDNER: He cared about students 
CantInued flam ..... 
amount of money thai flowed inlO the 
institution from organizations both public 
and priVale was immense. Gardner su~ 
ported the c:onlinued management of the 
University of Califomia-operated nuclear 
research labs in Livennore and Los 
Alamos. 

But while some of his actions seemed to 
reflect exactly what the regenls would want 
in • president, Gardner had another unique 
quality thai the regents probably couldn't 
have cared less about: be understood 
student needs. 

Fonner A.S. President and current 
UCSA Vice President John Edson says thal 
Gardner and his staff are "the administra-
tors that are most sensitive to students' 
needs." 

Gardner seemed to nuly feel for 
students, and seemed to relate to the nature 
of both the undergraduate and graduate 
experiences. When he visited UCSD during 
Spring Quarter of last year, he spent a good 
deal of time discussing the difficulties 
students face in choosing panicular courses. 
Such discussion pointed out the fact that 
Gardner was not divorced from the needs of 
the general student population. 

Which brings us back to Atkinson, who 
is half die man that Gardner is. He's exactly 
what the regents would like to see when it 
comes to bringing funding and prestige to 
the university, and he understands nothing 
about student interests. 

Atkinson has brought UCSD to the top 
of the heap in recognition as an "up-and-
coming" university, and has brought huge 
sums of money to campus projects. 

By any scale that the regents might use 
to meaure him - setting aside that linle 
per.;onaI scandal of his - Alkinson is a 
prime candidate for the position. 

But as far as students are concerned, 
UCSD's chancenor wouldn't be able to 
hold a candle to the rapport that Gardner 
seemed to establish with students. 

During his tenure at UCSD, Atkinson 
has seemingly relegated the undergraduates 
and graduates of his institution - the ones 
thal make UCSD a university, and not just a 
research group or think tank - to a 
peripberal role. 

As Edson puts it, "[UCSD) students are 
considered to be a subunit of Undergradu-
ate Affairs, rather than an integral part of 
this campus." 

In other words, Atkinson's management 
stnltegy has been a simple one - students 
aren't his problem. He has delegated die 
responsibility of dealing with students to 

subordinates - in the case of undergradu-
ates, Vice O1ancellor for Undergraduate 
Affairs Joe Watson. 

On one level, Atlcinson's delegation of 
authority has its advantages. At UCLA, a 
school with a chancellor who is active in 
student affairs, any decision made by the 
chancellor is final. If the UCLA chancellor 
has an opinion on a matter - and he often 
does - that opinion is final . 

Atlcinson, on the other hand, doesn't 
necessarily even have to be involved in the 
process. If Watson approves something for 
undergraduates, Atlcinson might not even 
have to know about it. 

In the case of the future of a student 
broadcast radio station, this was certainly 
the case - last year, the chancellor had to 
refer all questions about campus radio to 
Watson. He didn't know abool it. 

11le problem with such an attitude is on 
a larger, more fundamental scale. For 
students, the ideal administrator would 
probably be someone who saw the univer-
sity as being primarily focused on students 
and learning, with research and prestige 
being secondary concerns. 

David Gardner managed to see the 
university in more realistic tenns, under-
standing the immensity of the UC system 
while also grasping the fact that, beneath 
those researching faculty members, . 
government grants and new construction 
projects were thousands of young minds 
trying 10 grow both academically and 
socially. 

Realistically, the chances of Richard 
Atlcinson himself being chosen to be UC 
president aren't very good. He's only one 
of many people who might have a shot at 
the position.11le chancellors ofUC Davis, 
UCLA and UC Beikeley, as well as 
administrators from outside the university, 
have also been mentioned as possible 
successors to Gardner 

But die chances of the regents choosing 
someone like Atkinson are very good 
indeed. And that's a scary prospect. We've 
been lucky to have someone like David 
Ganl.ner, who did understand something 
about what it's like to be a studeill at the 
University of Califomia. 

What we may get in the next UC 
president is quite different: someone who 
sees the university as a massive research 
organ, staffed primarily with researchers 
and faculty. That person won't see UC 
students as the foundation of the institution 
- instead, they'll see students as a cog in 
the wheel, just another small subunit to be 
factored into some cold equation.

According to Rice. in looking 
over the Genreal Store's books, she 
noIiced some irregular business 
transactions. When she met with 
JeffCorben,GeneraI Store on Nov. 
6 .• Rice said she questioned Corbett 
about several "mystery checks." 

"Jeff then indicated he needed to 
go to the Credit Union to clarify 
what these 'mystery checks' were 
for. He finally got back to me last 
Friday when the mystery checks 
were rectified as peninent expendi-
tures, but there are ocher irregulari-
ties in the journals that remain 
unaccounted for," Rice said. 

Corbett said of the 
administraIion's action, "The ad-
ministration is IIICIDpting to say 
thai we are not keeping good ac-
counting records and tbal we are 
hiding where our money is going." 
Overall, Corbett said he believes 
that the adminisararlon is accusing 
the co-ops of not ruming their busi-
ness correctly. 

"As far as the accounting prob-

lems we did not caleb, IS soon as 
they weill broup to our auenDon.. 
we rectified them. MWns mistakes 
is a pan of the whole educational 
process whicb is the c:ssence of the 
co-op pbiIo6ophy," he added. 

According to Corbett, the audit 
may reveal other vio1ations of the 
PPM codes. "I WIS asking [Rice I 
about IlUditing ourselves a month 
and. half ago so that we could leam 
what we were doing wrong or right. 
If [the IlUdit I is used as an educa-
tionallOOl it could be helpful, but if 
it is used to force us to make a 
decision between an auxiliary ac-
count and an autonomous, outside 
vendor, then it will be harmful," he 
said. 

"As an autonomous off<ampus 
entity, we would have a difficult 
time providing students with the 
services we do now," Corbem said. 
"We will be forced to pay higher 
rent and, therefore, in tum we will 
have to raise our prices. 

"Or we may just be outbid, in 
which case we won't be here 81 all," 
headdcd. 

Corbett added that as an auxil-
iary account of the university, the 
enlirecooperativephilosophy would 
be lost.

He also said that he is asking the 
administrIIlion for a third altema-
tive which would allow the co-ops 
to retaiocontrol of their checkbooks 
and bookkeeping, but stiU remain 
under the umbreUa of the univer-
sity. 

"In my opinion. this administra-
tiveaction islim Carruthers' blatant 
abuse of power. The UCB should

Corbett said. 

Hanington alleged that the ad-
ministtation makes PPM policies 
without involving the co-ops. 

"It·s obviously to their advan-
tage if we are not infonned about 
their policies. They have not 81-
tempced to incorporate us into them. 
How can we be expected to foUow 
an er.cyclopedia of regulations that 
they change on a whim without 
giving us proper access to them?" 
she said. 

Harrington added that III every

to illcolporlllc the co-ops into this 
process, it has failed to do so.

the effect P.A.L is having. 

At a Third College reception for 
the parents of tutored students held 
on Saturday. Pamela Yap said that 
her first grade daughter Darletta has 
enjoyed learning more since TEP 
121 tudent Betty Hai started meet-
ing with her. 

"Darletta is taking a more posi-
tive attitude toward school. Before 
[she started meeting with] Betty, 
shesawschoolashomework .. . now 
he is having fun," said Yap. 

Hai added that Darletta's new-
found enthusiasm about learning has 
brought out her creativity and also 
built up her self-esteem. 

Rafael Hernandez. the coordina-
tor of the P.A.L. program. said his 
goal for the course this year is to 
inform people of its existence. and 
invite them to get involved. His 
long-term goals are more extensive. 

"Eventually, we hope that com-
munity service programs will spread 
to different departments, following 
P.A.L's lead," Hernandez said. 

After what Lytle feels was asuc-
cessful pilot program, the public 
service program was expanded this

yearto include TEPand Urban Stud-
ies Program students. 

According to Hernandez, the pr0-
gram looks for juniors or seniors 
who can provide a good role model 
to minority children who are poten-
tial college students, and in effect, 
recruit them for higher education. 

TheP.A.Lprogrambuildsaone-
on-one relationship between a 
UCSDstudentanda San Diego area 
elementary school tudent which 
lasts the entire school year. 

"It's not a traditional tutoring 
program, but closer to a big brother/ 
big sister program," said Lara 
Heisler, a teaching assistant forTEP 
121. TEP 121 is a 12-unit, three 
quaner sequence in which students 
travel to elementary schools to be 
mentors to students for four to six 
hours every week. 

Students also attend weekly lec-
tures which prepare them for their 
fieldwork. According to Hernandez. 
lectures cover topics such as moti-
vation,community involvement and 
parental involvement. 

The course also requires the stu-
dents to keep a journal of subjective 
accounts of their fieldwork and write 
papers on encounters with teachers 
and parents.

and developing the association. 

"Right oow, the group is a good 
forum for people 10 get lOgether and 
know that they're DOl alone -mal 
they have someone to talk 10," he 
said. 

'''The group wasn't developed 
from an issue of orientation," said 
OuistineOakley, &Cling chair of the 
LGBFSA. "We needed to develop 
an organizalion where people 
wouIdn'l feel alienated - where 
!hey could know thai there are other 
lesbian and gay staff members." 

However, according to Oaldey, 
the LGBFSA will begin 10 address 
relevant issues after the associalion 
has completed its organizational 
phase. Such issues include the con-
troversy surrounding domestic part-
ners and the problem that, because 
they are not officially recognized as 
being married, gay and lesbian 

couples cannot receive fmancial 
benefits from their partners. 

The LOBFSA is currently work.-
ing in conjunction with the student-
oriented Lesbian. Gay & Bisexual 
0rganizaIi0n (LOBA). "One of the 
firsI things we did was to designate 
a volWlteer to attend the LOBA 
meetings so thai we could have a 
liaison nelWork belWeen the IWO 
groups," said Oakley. 

In retum, the LOBA sends a rep-
resentative toattend LOBFSA meet-
ings. "There is an exchange of in for-
mation with lhe LGBFSA, and 
[LGBFSA] is willing to support the 
LOBA in the things we do," said 
lOBA Co-Olair Oleli Mohamed. 

"There is a dialogue between the 
Sludent and faculty groups.. . our 
main focus is working logether," 
added Steve Simmons. LOBA c0-
chair. 

According to Simmons, the 
lOBFSA will help the LOBA in 
planning activities for Gay and Les-

bilK! Awareness Week. 11le two or-
ganizations will also cooperate in 
organizing educational wor1cshops. 

Oakley said the LGBFSA will 
wOlt with the LGBA in an upcom-

The LGBFSAhasmet somecriti-

advertisement for the organization 
was published in several slaff ass0-

several negative responses. In addi-

All-American last year who led the 
Iem1 in both scoring RI reb0und-
ing and will likely do the same spin 
this year. 

Filling OUI the other forw.ro ~ 
silion across from Y 0UI18 will be 
Molly Jonnum. Last season·, do-
fensive MVP has WOItted aU sum-
meron hershoolins and is expected 
to oomribute more offensively. As 
the defensive stopper, Jonnum will 
SliII be malched up with the 
opponellt's bigaest offensive dual 
every game. 

At center will be 6-2 Lisa Bea-
ver, who was the second leading 
rebounder IasI year. Said Malone: 
"Lisa is such a force in the middle 
that teams have to double-team her. 
That leaves Carl Young free 10 go 
one-on-one, and 00 one can guard 
her like Ihat." 

Manning the point will be the 
1990 team MVP, Kathleen Alvarez. 
According to Malone, Alvarez's 
greatesl asseI is her court vision: 
"She sees the whole court. She'sgOl 
such great vision and when she sees 
someone she knows how to get the 
ball there." Alvarez is also the Trie 
IOns' only proven outside threat re-
turning from last year. 

The only questionable posilion 
for the Trilons is al off-guard. Vel-
eran Monique Vaillancourt and a 
lransfer from Cal Stale Stanislaus, 
Tricia Stilwell, are the leading COIle 
tenders to filllhe siOl. Stilwell has 
been hampered by an early-season 

SWIM 
ContInued from pep 10 
and Erin Bakey. Still, Boyd main-
tains thaI the team remains competi-
tive. "We're ahead of where we 
were last season, time-wise," he said. 
"And our execution is real good." 

A nationallille, however, is not a 
priority. '70winthenationals,that's 
not our team goal," said Boyd. "Our 
goals are as much in the classroom 
as in the pool." 

Nevertheless, the Tritons' dream 
isn't all rubble. Reluming AII-
Americans Sabrina Lum, Christy 
Parker, Jamee Couch and Cindy 
Miller are back to give Kenyon an-
othe.rtry. 

Lum h~ been strong in all the 
events, while Parker, a fifth-year 
senior and fonner rnember of the 
women's water polo team, has pr0-
vided solid depth in freestyle events 
as well as leadership. 

"A team leader? I'm not the cap-
tain, and I don't see myself as an 
influence in the pool," Parker said 

At 6-2, Usa Beaver Is a force Inside 
who will help to relieve some 
pressure from forward can Young. 

leg injury, but seems 10 have recov-
ered. 

According to Malone, Stilwell 
brings an addod dimension to UCSD. 
"She can run real well and is greal 
on defense because she is so quick. 
She also has a great outside shot, 
which will help take some pressure 
off of Alvarez," Malone said. 

One area Malone would like to 
see the Tritons improve on is learn 
speed. especially with a new-look 
offense this year that requires more 
quickness. "We're going to start 
nmningtheball more. We'll be look-
ing to break. a lot more and just 
putting a little more pace on the ball 
going up the floorlhis year,·' Malone 
said. 

The revamped run-and-gun of-
fense was born out of necessity. 

"But I've made so many friends on 
the team, and I try to empathize with 
younger swimmers. When they 
come to me with problems about 
how to balance swimming and 
schoolwork, 1 try to lell them I've 
been there." 

And there are always the shining 
stars in whal Parker calls "a Ion of 
freshmen" this year. 

Two distance swimmers, Kellie 
Lusk and Connie Romero, have re-
corded fast times. Liona Mason, a 
breaststtoker, is looking to fill an 
increasing lack of depth in that event. 
"Mason will probably fill in the 
Bakey gap on the breakslrOke," said 
Swenson, shrugging. "But we will 
see .. " 

The men's team returns all of its 
swimmers this year, with theexcep-
lion of Pete Smith and Brian .Link, 
who exhausted their eligibility last 
season. "Our men's learn is essen-
tially the same," said Boyd "I think 
we've got some more maturity on 
the team this year." 

One swimmer to watch is Trav is 

The UCSD Guardian 

"We've been rwming the sameballe 
control [offense] for the last few 
years. Every team knew what we 
were going to throw at them, so it 
was time for a change," Malone 
said. 

While the offense has changed. 
Malone plans to step up the empha-
sisondefense Ihat led 10 a recoro 15-
game win streak last year. If their 
quickness is improved as advertisod, 
the Tritons should be able to main-
tain the pressure required for their 
stiff man-to-man pressure defense. 

Despite some prediClable snags 
lhat come wilh a new offense, 
Malone's confidence is high. "I'm 
real optimistic aboul the season. 
We're playing better now than we 
were last year aI this lime. We just 
have to be sure 10 gel the new syslem 
in, then we'll be fme." 

Because oflast season '1\ succes , 
UCSD has to face a lougher sched-
ule this year. "We've got acoupleof 
tough early season games, also a 
tough tournament Pomona Pitzer 
will be real strong this season, and 
we've gOI a grudge match with 
Bethel College. There aredefinitely 
no sure wins this year." 

The Tritons barely missed OUlon 
the NCAA lournament last year, but 
with a No. 19 national ranking and 
four starters returning, lhey should 
be able to climb the next rung on the 
ladder. 

But it' s no sure thing, as Malone 
is quick to point out: "We don' t 
have any easy games. Everybody 
will want to knock u off, but lhat' s 
the fun of it." 

Miller, a sophomore backslroker 
whoalmost broke the I OO-yard back~ 
stroke record at last year's nation-
als. 

Another is John Rowers, who is 
back after fighting injuries all last 
year. He fmished third in the 100-
yard free allast year's nationals. 

The Tritons are riding their dis-
tance freestyle hopes on the shoul-
ders of Marte Fabien, who placed 
founh in the 500 free and fifth in the 
1,650 free at last year's nalionals. 

Some new faces mal80yd won't 
speculate on as ofyel are Gabe Spier 
and Brian Baskin. 

Last weekend, the Tritons tested 
the waler, as it were, with meets 
against Cal State Northridge and 
Pepperdine in Malibu. 

Against Division 1 CSU 
Northridge, the women went down 
161-134. 1be men's learn was ale 
mosl more than CSUN could chew, 
but the Matadors finally prevailed 
138-130. Host Pepperdine, boast-
ing only a women's team, was 
drowned by the Tritons 162-124.

SEASON PREVIEW 

• The men's swim team returns basically the same 
group, while the women's swim team is rebuilding 
By AItAty GIIyton 
Senior Staff Writer 

Once long ago, the UCSD men's 
and women's swim teams had aspi-
rations of becoming the NCAA Di-
vision m champions. Every year, 
they'd build a solid team that was 
good. but not good enough 10 topple 
perennial swimming power Kenyon 
College. 

Last season, the Triton women 
did their best to shake the Lords' 
eight-year grip on the national title. 
They broke 13 records, and stiU 
never came close on their way to a 
second-place finish. It's a sadder 
story for the men. who are facing a 
Kenyon College men's team that 
has racked up 13 consecutive titles. 
Last year. UCSD fmished third. 

The development of Triton 
swimming might be likened to the 
building of the Tower of Babel.

OHIO WESLEYAN BABSON 

The I 99Onational championship runners-up have 
allowed just nine goals this year, and senior goalie 
Reed Welch has posted 15 shutouts. Offen ively, the 
Battling Bishops present a potent multi-pronged 
anack led by forwards Andy Kessinger, a senior who 
led the team with 13 goals, and Wayne Street, a 5-5 
freshman, and sophomore rnidfielders Mike Pepe 
and Ouis Duff. Another player to watch is forward 
Sean Cain. who had nine assists. 

The three-time national champion Beavers have 
allowed 10 goals and goalie Steve Webber has 
posted 15 shutouts. Offensively. Babson hasn't been 
overpowering,just effective. Chris Connors led the 
Beave.rs with II goals, followed by mid fielders 
Teny Jackson and Eri.k Isbrandtsen with six apiece. 
Forward Nathan Taylor led the team in assists with 
seven and tied for third on the team in goals with 
Tom LaPointe (five). 

UC SAN DIEGO TRENTON STATE 

The Triton defense was solid throughout the 
regular season, but has sprung a lealc of late, allowing 
seven goals in the last three games. Part of the 
problem can be attributed to injuries, which have 
hampered goalie Michael Madden and forced Head 
Coach Derek Annstrong to calion his bench. On the 
other hand, the offense has picked up the slack, 
exploding for II goals in three games, behind for-
wards Mike Alberts, Chris Romey and Ouis Hanssen. 

The high-scoring Lions (79 goals) were 2-1 win-
ners over UCSD on Sept. 10. They are led by Mike 
Edwards, Anthony Daniele and Scott Bemstiel. 
Other threats include eight-goal scorers Keith Woods 
and Peter Crawford, midfielder Russ Terlecki and 
freshman fullback Dean Gr.lY. Defense has been an 
achilles heel-the Lions have gi ven up 22 goal this 
year. Goalie Mike Rentner had to make 90 saves -
far and away the most of any keeper in the final four.

Following the win over 
MacMurray, forward Mike Alberts 
said that the Tritons were being a 
little more conservative on defense, 
and not asking their fullbacks to 
help out so much on offense. 

Anotherproblem has been goalie 
Michael Madden, who is suffering 
from a knee injury. "He's got a 
cartilage hanging out." Annstrong 
said. "He hasn't been able to work 
out for four weeks." 

The effects of the injury have 
shown. Madden has misplayed at 
least three balls that have led to 
goals. 

TIle situation is so worrisome 
that the Tritons will start Alex Spain 
at fullback, despite the sophOmore 
defender's sore ankle. Last week-
end, Spain had trouble sprinting,

and was eventually pulled in favor 
of Jeff Gagnon. when MacMurray 
scored on a breakaway down his 
side of the field. "[Spain's ankJe J is 
not so good. but he' s going to play," 
Annsb'Ongsaid. "He's a good player, 
and I'd like him on the field." 

Part of the reason for the Tritons' 
concem is the Ohio Wesleyan of-
fense.lt'sabalanced.multi-pronged 
attack that can feature as many as 
five players, including Andy Kes-
singer, who scored 13 goals. 

On defense, Ohio Wesleyan has 
allowed just nine goals in 23 games 
and tallied 15 shutouts. The Tritons 
will counter with an offense that has 
erupted for 11 goals in the last three 
games behind forwards Chris 
Romey, Chris Hanssen and Alberts . 
Annstrong isn't sure how much 
longertheoffensecancanyUCSD: 
"It's like how many times can you 
go to the well for water?" he said. 

" It's a very important point that we 
don't get behind again, because 
we've [come from behind] so many 
times I don't think we can do it 
again." 

UCSD has come from behind in 
all of its postseason wins. 

One problem for the Tritons 
might be going up against a stingy 
Ohio Wesleyan defense without the 
services of senior midfielder Mike 
Lodoen, who suffered a,hamstring 
injury last weekend. Armstrong said 
that he'll decide on Friday whether 
freshman Ken Fujii or sophomore 
Todd Curran will take Lodoen's 
place. "Lodoen definitely has big 
shoes to fill," Fujii said. "But I just 
go out and do what I need to do ... 

Albens noted following the 
MacMurray win that the offense is 
not a concern: "We have the fire-
power up front. It's just a matter of 
puuing it together [in back]."

'Big' is Word 
Of Choice for 
Tritons in '91 
• PIMtew: Men's 
basketball returns just 
two starters from last 
year, but is ranked No. 
12 in preseason polls 
ByCINR .... 
AssocI.te Sports Editor 

The UCSD men' basketball 
tearn (ranked No. 12 in preseason 
polls) is back, but minus its leading 
scorer from last year - Tim Rapp 
- as well as twO other starters. 
While you may think that Rapp's 
loss spells trouble for the Tritons. 
Head Coach Torn Marshall- en-
tering his ninth year - and the 
players think they'll be just fine. 

Offensively. the Tritons are go-
ing to concentrate more on the in-
side game, a big change from lasl 
year's perimeter style with Rapp 
and Torn Shawcrofi. "We've made 
adjustmenls to focus the ball more 
on lhe inside," Marshall said. 

Considering UCSD's size. il 
makes good sense to go to the in-
side. With 6-7 Rick Ban in the five 
spot. 6-6 Andy Swindall at four. and 
6-6 Chris Moore at Ihree. the Tri-
tons will be big. especially by Divi-
sion LD sundards. "'There's not a 
whole lot of size in Divi ion LD ... 
You're going to see more pounding 
on the inside," Marshall said. 

With the swilCh to the inside 
game, Bart. one of two retuming 
starters, will assume a larger role in 
the offense than last year, when he 
was already the primary threat from 
the post. "Rick was big last year. 
and we wanl him 10 be able to pin 
and even take a couple dribbles in 
there." Marshall said 

Batt seems to be up to lhe task 
that Marshall is puning before him. 
"I lost some weight [about 10 Ibsl. 
so I'm quicker and a little faster," 
Bait said. 

He added that over the off-sea-
son, he has worked on developing 
his right hand - his off hand. 

Moore will be another key. 
Marshall pointed outlhat Moore, a 
sixth man last year, is really the one

Chris Moore (42) will fill the position left open ~ TIm Rapp, while Rick 
Batt (55) has lost weight in an effort to become quicker and faster. 
filling Rapp's shoes. Getting the 
ball inside will be the responsibility 
ofDarvin Jackson, the other retum-
ing starter, who will tart for the 
third straight year. 

"I've always been a role player 
in distributing the ball," Jackson 
said. On the other Iwxl, he know 
that hi role will be expanded this 
year: "I'm going to have to be a little 
bit more of a scoring threat." 

Realizing the need to compen-
sate for Rapp's scoring last year, 
Jackson worked on his shooting over 
the off-season. "My shooting has 
improved drastically," he said. 

Defensively, Marshall wants to 
play an agressive, man-to-man style 
as much as possible. "We want 10 
force teams to do what we want 
them to and not let them dictate," he 
said. To do this, he plans to imple-
ment a trapping defense. "We want 
(0 run lots of half-court or baseline 
traps. We don't want to allow easy 
ball-reversal," Marshall said. 

By using the traps, MarshalJ 
hopes to create easy turnovers. "The 
big men can trap and Carvin has the 
speed to take away passing lanes," 

Marshall said. He added that he 
expects Jackson's steal totals to go 
up from last year. 

Not only will the traps help to 
increase Jackson's steal totals, but 
Jackson's quick hands, alone, are 
enough to create several turnovers. 
"Darvin and Rodney [Lusain) have 
goc the fastest hands of any two 
guards I've ever been associated 
with," Marshall said. 

One area of concern is the Tri-
tons' depth. "We're not as deep as 
last year at this point,.. Marshall 
said. Couple that with an experience 
problem. Last yar's sllrlm had 
played 56 straight panes together, 
and only one newcomer, Rodney 
Lusain, made the squad. 

lbis year, in contrast, there are 
five new players-Gibson Arnold, 
Lincoln Combs, Joey Drake, Brad 
Halte and Kareem Mathews. Batt 
and JacJcson are the only seniors. 

But even with a relatively young 
squad, Marshall is confident that the 
returning veterans can carry the load: 
"1be guys know what it takes to get 
to March ... They know what it takes 
(0 win." 

There's lots of opporhmity here to 
learn if you're motivated. You can go 
any direction - managerial, technical.

Second, it's been nearly two and 
a half months since the Tritons lost 
a game to a Di\'ision m team and 
over a year since they lost a match. 
Third. they have five of the top six 
vote-getters for AlI-West Region 
honors in Fabian. Dana Simone, 
Elizabeth Tan, Vikki Van Duyne 
and Heather Holtzclaw. Fourth, they 
have been ranked No. I in the nation 
all year. Fifth. the Tritons have never 
lost a postseason match outside the 
stale of California. 

Want more? UCSD has been in 
the title match eight times and has 
an all-time NCAA tournament 
record of 31-4. 

1be only way "dynasty" could 
scream any Jouderis ifit weret1asbed 
on a neon billboard in Las Vegas. 

But, on more than one occasion 
in the history of sport, "dynasties" 
have been shown to be mortal. And 
if there are any teams in this year's 
field capable of pulling off one of 
the biggest upsets in the tour-
nament's history, they wiD be in St. 
Louis: Juniata, Washington (MO) 
and Wisconsin-Oshkosh. . 

1be Tritons' opponent in the 
semifUlal will be Juniata, a school 
whichcomesawfuUycJosc tomatch-
ing UCSD's record of postseason 
success. The Indians have made 
seven consecutive trips to the fUlal 
four and nine overall According to 
Dannevik, a big reason for their 
success is Head Coach Larry Bock. 

"[Bock] is very good. I think 
he's one of the best in the nation," 
Dannevik said. Bock wiD call on the -
services of All-East Region selec-
tions Ouisty Orndoff, a freshman 
outside hitter, and Larissa Weimer, 
a sophomore middle blocker. 

"[Bock] will prepare them weU, 
but they're smaller and slower. It'U 
be our quick tempo versus their 
slowtcmpO,"Danneviksaid. "They 
will try to exploit a weakness that 
they feel we have, but I don't know 
what that is. " 

Another factor could be the indi-
ans' youth - they have Ilfresh-
men and sophomores on the roster.

JUNIATA 

Juniata Head Coach Larry Bock has told colleagues that he 
believes the Indians are a year away from being serious national 
contenders. Juniata is a young team with II freshmen and s0pho-
mores, and just one senior. The Indians' Jack of experience will be 
a factor, but how is the question. On the one hand, the Indians could 
crumble under the pressure of a final four. On the other hand, the 
players might not know any better and play over their heads, figuring 
they have noIhing to lose. Juniata is led by two fTeshmen - .5-5 
outsidehincrOJriS!y Omdoff(the team leader in kills) and 5-6 seiter 
Heather Blough. Another player to walCh is 5-10 sophomore middle 
blocker Larissa Weimer, who led the team in blocks. This is a very 
small team, and realisticaJly it doesn't have a shot against the bigger, 
faster and more-experienced Tritons. But UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik has a great deal of respect for Bock and warns that the 1.5-
year veteran is fully capable of engineering an upset. 
UC SAN DIEGO 

Talk about your Joaded guns. The Trilons are a six-shooter with 
seven bullets. 1be defending national champions have not lost a 
match to a Division ill team all year. They have won 15 straight 
matches in three-straight games. Physically, they are the biggest 
team in Division m. UCSD had five of the top six vote-getters for 
All-West Region honors. They relumall but one player (seiter Amy 
BanachowsJci) from last season's title winning tearn, and according 
to Dannevilc. Banachoww's replacemen" Julie Fabian, is better. 
The players to walCh all year have been middle blocker Elizabeth 
Tan (an All-West selection along with Fabian and Dana Simone) 
and outside hitter Vikki Van Duyne. Bu( OIhers to watch are Simone 
(a standout defensively), outside hitter Liz Vesanovic (who has a 
phenomenal track record of big games in the tournament) and 
middle blocker Heather HoltzClaw. 

"There's alotof pressure, and if you 
haven't been there before, you don 'I 
respond very well," Dannevik said. 
"My gut call is we beat Juniata in 
four and face Washington in the 
final." 

If that is the case, it would be a 
rematch of last season's title game, 
when the Tritons stunned the Bears 
in their own gym. 

But for that to be the case, the 
Bears wiJ1 have to get by Wiscon-
sin-Oshkosh, and the Titans' 6-1 
middle blocker Amy Cayemberg, 
who has been called "W1Stoppable." 
Cayemberg leads UWO in kills, hit-

tingpercentageand blocks, and was 
named to the AlI-Central tearn. 

Washington lost three players 
from last season's runner-up squad, 
but does feature Player of the 
Yearcandidate KeJ1y Meier, a 5-10 
senior setter. 

According to Dannevik, Meier 
might not be enough. "I don't think 
the people they have replacing [the 
ones they lost) are as good." he said. 

"We're the best team,"Dannevik 
said. "We're 50 percenl better than 
we were last year at this time. No 
one else can say they're 50 percent 
better."

UCSD Tritons VI. 
Bann All-Stars 
A II, 111E FUN 11IAT GOES WI11t being a Division 1Il athletics powemouse. If J 
had to explain UCSD sports to 
someone, I'd jusl have them take 
a walk through this month. 

• Domination o/Triton sports 
t~ams. Every UCSD Fall Quaner 
sport - without exception -
made it to the final . Not postsea-
son play, butthefilll1ls. And two 
of them- men's soccer and 
women's volleyball- are good 
shots to win the champion hip. 

Yet let' not forget to point out 
that UCSD SlUdents are relatively 
apathetic about their university's 
ports teams. 1lte men's soccer 

regional was held here last 
weekend, and the turnout might 
have reached 500. Pathetic for a 
school of 14,000. I can only hope 
more people show up at this 
weekend's final . 

• The need to move to Division 
II. I'm on record as hating (he idea 
of big-time college sports, a la 
Jerry Tarkanian and Pat Dye. I 
wrote a column in January 
warning of the dangers of a 
divisional change. But UCSD will 
never be Division I, and Division 
IT is a must for this institution. 

T AKE WOMEN'S volleyball. When they wrap up the 
national championship this 
weekend in SI. Louis (J guarantee 
it, kind of like George Zimmer), 
that will mark seven champion-
ships in II years. Please. This is 
not a Division m team. 

UCSD is a big fi h in what is 
no longer even a little pond. 
We're a whale in a drop of water. 
[t's time 10 move on. 

• The persollal cost 0/ domi-
nance. In the major league 
baseball All-Star game, there must 
be olle representative from every 
team. If one of the major league 
teams had 23 bananas and Peter 
Ko on its roster, then our pal Ko 
would become an all-star. 

The NCAA has a similar rule: 
no team may have more than three 
players named on the All-Region 
team. Since UCSD's volleyball 
team is so dominant, five of the 
ix top vote-gehers for the All-

Region team were Tritons. But 
only Elizabeth Tan, Julie Fabian, 
and Dana Simone are AII-
Regional. Those three are now 
eligible to become All-Americans. 

As FOR Villi Van Duyne and Heather Holtzclaw. the other 
Tritons who finished in the top six 
- they're out in the cold Van 
Duyne and Holtzclaw should be 
All-Regional players. But they're 
tuck at UCSD. Big whale, linle 

drip. 
So if I had to explain to 

someone about sports, and I only 
had a few seconds in which to 
speak, l'd tell them this: 

Take a look at what happened 
in November. They're too good. 
They're just way too good.

1be UCSDrnen'ssoccerteaffi is 
flying blind this weelcend. 

In the midst of preparing for this 
weekend's NCAA Division III 
men's soccer semifinal match 
against No. I Ohio Wesleyan, Head 
Coach Derek Annstrong and the 
Tritons have Ieamcd thai they won't 
have a scouting report. 

1lte Baaling Bishops belong to 
the North Coast Athletic Confer-
ence which prohibits NCACschools 
from giving out scouting reports on 
each other. And, according to Arm-
strong, he has exhausled every re-
source he knows to fand one, "I've 
just about given up," he said 

Armstrong added that a lack of a 
scouting report cost the Tritons a 
win in last year's tournament when 
they fell to Wheaton 1-0 in the 
quanerfinals. 1be Crusaders scored 
on a long throw-in, a weapon UCSD 
was unaware that Wheaton had in 
its arsenal. 

Annstrong said that this week-
end, the Tritons will do the only 
thing they can: "We'll make some 
assessrnents in the first IOminutes." 

Furthermore, he noted that, be-
cause UCSD is an independent 
school, Ohio Wesleyan, more than 
likely, has a fairly detailed report on 
the Tritons. 1be report will prob-
ably emphasize their strength in the 

Last year the women's basketball 
head coach guided the Tritons to the 
best season in the program's his-
tory. And with seven players return-
ing from last year's record-break-
ing 21-5 squad, including four start-
ers, she has every reason to be c0n-
fident. 

SOphomore Heather Holtzclaw was sixth In All-West Re&ion wtlne. 

Heading into this year's season-
opening tournament at Redlands, 
the Tritons are No. 19 in the NCAA 
Division m preseason poll That 
ranking is a mixed blessing how-
ever: "(t's nice to be ranked but it 
just means that everyone will be 
gunning for us now," MaIone said. 

To live up to expectations, 
Malone will counI on players like

Anyone who regularly goes to San Diego's Landmark 
Theaters - the Cove in La Jolla, the Park and the Guild 
in Hillcrest, the Ken in Nonnal Heights - has seen him 

at least once, and probably more often than that. He's 
the one standing at the door of the theater after the 
movie lets out, nodding and smiling, usually dressed 
in dark slacks, white shirt, suspenders, his hair neatly 
slicked back. 

Regulars and art/foreign ftIm buffs who are famil-
iarwith him, stop by and chat before going out into the 
evening. Who the hell is this man?

Fritjof Capra Lets Your 
Mind Do illS Walking 
By Kendy Hurd 
Guardian Reporter 

If you have been searching 
high and low for the answer -
the an wer - then this film 
should help you along on your 
way. "Mindwalk"i afilmbased 
on the book The Turning Point 
by Fntjof Capra, the famed au-
IhorofThe TODD/Physics. It isa 
v isuall y simple film that gains its 
slrenglh from lhe thick and rel-
evant philo ophy that comes 
from the script. 

Mo ..... 
• "Mindwalk" opens 

tomorrow :It the Hillcrest 
Cinemas. 

The film's three main charac-
ters are a disenchanted nuclear 
physicist- Liv Ullman, a failed 
presidential candidate - Sam 
Watterson and an American poet 
living in France - John Heard. 
They all stroll through the medi-
eval splendor of the island mon-
astery Mont SI. Michel. 

This serring plays an interesl-
ing foil to the post-modem, po-
Iiticall y correct theme of the 
film's message. 

In simple terms the film ad-
dresses the problems of the mod-
em age, what €apra defines as a 
"crisis of perception." Through 
the character played by Ullman, 
Capra's ideas spring forth to il· 
lustrate to the public how interre-
lationships in lhe world connect 
nearly every field and idea. The 
film draws finn relationships 
between physics, biology, eco-
nomic, poetry and much more. 
The problems with the world' 
resources, violence, racism, femi-
nisl'ftandthestructureoftheatom 
all weave their way into the script 
as well. 

What matters in "Mindwalk" 
is the sheer relevance of the sub-
ject and questions raised within. 
ThecharactersarestructuredweU 
and are believable - they all 
have their conuadictions. Often 
in the film it is the poet who has 
to bring the other two characters 
back down to earth when they 
start to journey into concepts too 
abstract

How to Break lI.to IIS8 Malic llliidu.lry 
• Well, notexactIy, but it can be a lot easier than you'd think. Here's 
an example of one woman who is well on her way ... 
By ........... 
HilJtus Editor 

Meet Dorothy Knapp. the Sony 
(Epic, Columbia. Def Jam. d a1) 
Music repracnrative forUCSD. She 
brings us listening panies, and even 
an artist every now and then. What 
is special about Dorothy Knapp is 
not whal she does for the campus 
conununity, but her place outside of 
the spotlight. 

Most people think you have to 
know someone to break into the 
music business. That idea mist. 
have some validity - but only to an 
extent. It is this mystique on how to 
get involved in the business that 
keeps some music lovers from even 
trying. 

Getting your foot in the door 
seems like an insunnountable chal-
lert8e for some when, in actuality, 
getting your foot in is the easy part. 
No one starts out as a road manager 
or concert promoter - everyone 
has to learn the ropes somewhere. 

Knappexplaincd how it isn't al-
ways that difficult to get one's foot 
in the door. "I ran against Matt 
[Schnurer, fonner conunisioner of 
progranming] and lost I got toknow 
Lan)' [Weintraub, fonner manager 
of Assorted Vinyl] through Matt, 
and [Lany] knew I was really into 
music and wanted to do something 
music-related. [LaITy) gave me a 
flyer for the CBS [now owned by 
Sony ] job .• . " and the rest is history. 

"If you're interested. there's a 
bunch of record companies looking 
for [interns], someone to do free 
worle," Knapp explained. The fact 
is, interships are a great way to find 
out if· you really want that music-
related career you thought was so 
ideal. 

Knappadvised, ") caution people 
to be sure that [the music industry) 
is what they really want to do. It's 
not hard, but you have to really want 
to do it." A zillion phone calls, pub-
lic and artist relations. dealing with 
the record big-wigs - a day in the 
life of a promotions person. 

What is Knapp's role at the uni-

I I I Ide Dorothy Knapp wheels and deals over the phone. 
versity? "My job is to promote all 
those artists thaldon't usually get on 
the radio. I get a bunch of tools: my 
quantity of COs, my posters, money 
if I need it. And then I get my tickets 
and stay in contact with the press 
people, the retail people. [Sony] teUs 
me whar to do - and sometimes I 
don't listen. " 

But Knapp doesn't always need 
to listen, because she still finds suc-
cess as long as she foUows her in-
stincts. 

"I dreamed about doing this, and 
now I'm doing this. It makes me 

. think I can do anything ... I'll wake 
up with promotional ideas-they'll 
keep me up. They've done Ibis for-

cspp 

ever," she said. 
The future holds bigger and bet-

ter things for Knapp. Her foot is in 
the door, and she is on her way. If 
you live and love music, spend a day 
at either the Associated Students 
Imemship offICe or the Academic 
Imcmship office and see what is 
offered. 

You can even call the label you'd 
like to worle for and see if they offer 
internships. 

Besides, record jobs have great 
perles, as Knapp explained, "It 
sounds real cheesy, but the real rea-

As San Diego's city manager of 

the nation 's largest an house theater 
chain, Russell's job is not all fame 
and fortWlC. While he is well known 
in the city because of his worle with 
the press and members of the com-
munity, he also occasionally has to 
take care of more mundane matters, 
like broken popcorn machines, 
clogged toilets, and uncooperative 
projectors - not stuff that coUege 
really trains you for. 

"The first time I fixed a projec-
tor," Russell recalled, ". had some-
one giving me instructions on the 
phone. It was like doing bean sur-
gery over the phone, or something 
out of 'Airport 'n' - 'Well, I'm 
flying in over the airport right now, 
what do I do now?'" 

Broken machinery aside, 
RusscU'sotherresponsibilities range 
from organizing press and sneak 
preview screenings of upcoming 
films, to setting up interviews for 
the press with ftlm directors and 
stars, to making sure the film prints 
get into town on time, to - and this 
one has been all-consuming for 
Russell these past few months -
knowing every last detail concern-

in. the brand-spanlting-new 
Hillcrest Cinemas, whichcelebnles 
its grand opening tonighL 

ca_1LIidMJIY va. 
OIII.IALII'Y 

The five-screen, $2 million mul-
tiplex located at thecomcrofWash-
ingtonand Fifth may at first seem to 
epitomize the antithesis of the cin-
ema paradiso thatl..andmark is sup-
posedly about . 

The chain is known for running 
an films by smaller,less commer-
cial distributors in old. ambience-
filled single-screen theaters. But 
Russell disagrees with that criti-
cism. He has great faith in the origi-
nality of the multiplex's modem 
architecture, the craftsmanship of 
the theater's construction, and Ihe 
importance of having more art 
screens in San Diego. 

Looking out over the terracotta-
toned Village Hillcrest complex in 
which the theaters are located, 
RusseU said, "People say 'Oh it's 
just Horton Plaza for Uptown,' but 
there's very little truth in that. Look 
at it - it's not very psychotic in 
design. It's got a unifonn .tesign, 
and it's very open to the street. You 
really get a sense that you're always 
adjacent to Fifth Avenue - it's not 
very removed." 

RusseU believes that the Hillcrest 
Cinemas has an ambience of its 
own, with special attention given to 
the interiors. '1'he new place is de-
signed with an effort to create a 
unique place, a place that has an 
atmosphere, a place that is different 
from the general commercial

places. .. 
"People say we're going toocom-

mercial [with this multiplex)" 
Russell said, "but the Park already, 
in a sense, has been straddling that 
fencebetweenoommercialfalmsand 
an films with things like 'Barton 
Fmk' and 'La Femme Nikita. ' They 
straddle the fence in the most posi-
tive sense of the word - in terms of 
bridging the cultural gap. 'Barton 
Fmk' brought in the most main-
stream audience we'd had in a long 
time." 

While he does talk about rnaricet-
ing techniques, Russell, at heart, is

not the cold. hard businessman. "[ 
do this job because I really love 
movies and film:' he said. 

"We can't forget that it's a busi-
ness,"heconccded, "but we're try-
ing to offer a premium product. not 
just a product. The films are more 
handcrafted, and in many cases 
they're independently produced." 

As a "big, little company," 
Russell says, Landmark tries to 
maintain a "local" feel in each city. 
"Although some of the things that I 
may do might have national impli-
cations, my job as city manager is 
mainly to worry about here and 

HIATUS H3 

make sure we have a local face. 
That's why people tend to think thal 
Landrnaric is based in whichever 
city they live in, because we try to 
keep a local profile." 

LOCAUIY AND ....rAInY 
Russell's links to San Diego's 

anistic communities can be traced 
back to film and coffee: after drop-
ping out of UCSD's undergraduate 
communication program in the early 
'80s, he found himself employed at 
both the Ken Cinema and the Java 
Coffeehouse.

the people at Java - feeling a part 
of the life of the city, the way a 
bartender or a counterperson does," 
Russell related. "People came in 
who ~ involved in various parts 
of the community, and Java was at 
the center of it." 

His job at the Ken brought the 
local subcultures together even 
more, and "before I knew it, I was 
managing the Ken. I really went at it 
with a passion," he said 

People, Russell found, were far 
more imponantto him than the "feel-
ing of hopelessness" that he'd g()(-
ten from the "machine of criticism" 
that thecommunicat ions department 
had taught him about. 

"Once you reach a level of abil-
ity of critical thinking, you need to 
tart pursuing a practice and appli-

cation of that in different ituations. 
"I was working full time trying 

to put myself through school and 
feeling more and more removed 
from what they were doing there, 
the way they took this whole critical 
theory approach to everything. Part 
of [my dropping out] was this philo-
sophical crisis, part of it was just 
burnout. part of it was my working 
too much. So I quit [school]. 

"I don't know what I use from 
my college education at all," he 
reflected, "except for maybe the 
mental capacity to somehow ratio-
nalize all of thi into some coherent 
idea of 'Why Am I Here?'" 

Upon further reflection, Russell 
admitted, "I think the most impor-
tant thing you can get from college 
is the people you meet. More than 
any job experience or knowledge. 
it's who you know. Not that every-
thing i nepotism and conuption, 
it's just that if you know the person, 
there's already an understanding 
before you make a bu iness transac-
tion. 

"It's who you know and your 

ability 10 deal with infonnalion -
thal's the biS COIDInodity thesedays. 
Tbal'd be the big lou if I were 10 be 
nmoverby a truck tomonow,all the 
infonnalion in my head. Anyone 
can write a schedule or fix a projec-
tor, but it's all in the people I know 
- in one second, with a big ttash 
truck [be snaps his rmgers ],just like 
that, gone." 

TAUUN8 ....... 
RusseU's contact with people in 

his job is not merely in the entertain-
ment industry - he also enjoys 
gening to know San Diego's film 
buffs. Unfortunately, with the re-
sponsibilities of being city man-
ager, he has fewer opportunities to 
mingle with audiences. 

"I miss being able to greet people 
after the movie , which was two-
thirds of the job at the Ken. When 
the movies get out, I like to stand out 
there so people can come up to me 
and let me know their reactions." 

Russell continued, "llikeitwhen 
I hear someone say, 'What did that 
mean1What was that about?' I think 
it' good that you ask those ques-
tions, and talk about them. With so 
many coffee house nearby-
Quelle, SoHo, The Study - people 
can go there afterwards and talk 
about what the film mean . 

"Too often, I think, when people 
don't know what something means, 
they think that, ... they're igno-
rant," Russell said. "But it's a sign 
of complex filmmaking. not a ign 
of ignorance. I think people are afraid 
to be ignorant of things. You have to 
overcome that fear barrier. Some of 
the best movies I ever saw, some of 
my favorite movies, took me a few 
viewings before I actually under-
tood all the dialogue, much less 

what it meant. 
"People always di miss them-

selves saying, 'Well, I don't know 
too much about film,' but that's not 
the point."

misconceptions about the inacces-

MINDWALK 
ContInued from ~ H2 
The Turning Poilll in the classic 
fonn of a dialogue. Taking inspira-
tion from Galileo's dialogue on the 
world system, the director took the 
three characters out of the Italian 
piazza and placed them in the mod-
em day and age-he even made the 
Galileo-based character a woman. 

The film is thought-proVoking at 
best, a bit slow at worst. 1llere isn't 
any reason nolto see it. "Mindwalk" 
is so relevant it almost hurts. 

While you may be inclined to 
disregard the movie based only on 
the fact that PC has reached an al-
most annoying level of trendiness. 
the majority of the poinls made in 
"Mindwalk" are nevertheless im-
portant to acknowledge.

"Dr. FausIUIUJbIa thelJahls," 
the rarst universily-produced play 
in the Mandell Weiss Forum, hits 
the staae this weekend. And leSt 
assured thal the production wiD be 
unlike any you have seen in the 
pal 

Gertrude Stein wrote this piece 
in 1936. Dissolving the boundaries 
between poetry, essays, and por-
traits, Stein confused styles and 
mixed them together. Second-year 
graduate student Director Mall 
Wilder believes Stein is the first 
writer to "emancipate" the English 
language. 

Wilder is a self-<lescribed eclec-
tic director who, with the excep-
tion of a fellow graduate student, 
likes to direct only the works of 
dead playwriJhts. "Theycan'tcom-
plain about the production in re· 
hearsals," said Wilder at a recent 
breakfast interview. 

"The play has no substance," 
Wilder said. "The question of con-
tent isl!lways very problematic with 
Stein. She dissolves the story of the 
Faust myth in her own language 
machine to produce vibrations that 
operate on each audience member 
individually." Wilder chose this 
play not only due to an interest in 
theater that produces strong em0-
tion, but because he "knew the play 
would jam-up the apparatus of in-

1'banday, No\iCmbcr 11, 1991 
, 

stitutional theaIer as much as pas-
sible." 

The play may have no content and 
noSUbsllnce. but it SliD can be ooder-
stood. Stein once commented on her 
works. "If you understapd it, you 
enjoy iL If you enjoy it, you ooder-
stand iL" PatIaps this work can best 
be described as an experience. 

"My favoriae kind of thealer is 
when my body likes it, but my brain 
can't flgwe out why. I have to go 
back apin. Or maybe a third time," 
said ~-June Sanchez, a gradu-
ate student who is playing Dr. Faustus. 

"The play has many ideas in it, but 
it is not about the transmission of 
ideas. It's [idea is] to create an expe-
rience in the audience," Wilder said. 
Stein uses the repetition of words to 
act "like a religious ceremony and 
make the words lose their nickel-
and-dime content 

"Stein is the only modem writer 
who still makes people as nervous 
today as when she originally wrote 
the piece. It's a difficult experience 
for the spectator," said Wilder. 

"People get to that point and real-
ize they've lost their individuality 
and they really have nothing. You 
can walk through this play and expe-
rience so many emotions. And it 
looks really cool," Sanchez said. 

Perhaps the only way to possibly 
understand this production is to ex-
perience it. As Sanchez said. "It's 
fwlny.It'ssadlt'sbetterlhan902IO."
