PROVIDENCE, R.1. 
Discovering yet another avenue to 
profit from test taking and the col-
lege application process, the 
College Board has started to sell 
student e-mail addresses to col-
leges and universities for the pur-
pose of soliciting possible appli-
cants. 

According to Brad Quin, exec-
utive director of admission at the 
Reston, Va., office o( the College 
Board, selling e-mail addresses is 
just the beginning of the use of e-
mail by college admission offices.

University cites concert 
incidents, claims the cafe 
violated its contract 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

Members of the Che Cafe and other progressive 
groups rallied at UCSD administration offices 
Wednesday demanding that the university withdraw 
allegedly slanderous accusations against them. 

According to Kris Bohling, a principal member 
of the Che Cafe Collective, the university has 
accused the Che of violating its contract and has 
cited incidents of violence and alcohol abuse at its 
shows. The university has been unable to show 
any proof supporting these accusations, Bohling 
said. 

"We have not been provided with any docu-
mentation concerning any incidents at all: 
Bohling said. "I'm not saying that none of these 
incidents happened . My belief is that there were 
things that may have happened, but that they were 
so minuscule that they didn 't have any incident 
report written about them." . 

Bohling added that the incidents have recently 
been exaggerated by the university in order to pro-
vide an excuse to shut the Che down. He said the 
administration targets co-ops and other progres-
sive groups because they attack the idea that 
UCSD should be funded by corporate interests, 
arguing that the same in erests fund the regents 
and the administration. 

The Che has complied with the security and 
insurance requirements of the administration which 
ask that the cafe have a certain amount of guards at 
the shows, and at this time no other restrictions 
have been imposed, according to Randy Woodard, 
UCSD's advisor to the Che Cafe and assistant 
director of student activiti~ and governments.

Senior Dies in Car Accident 
En Route to Regionals 
M ember of UCSD water ski team struck tragedy 
on· deserted Arizona highway 

Senior Staff Writer 

Dustin Kirk Newell, a Muir 
senior and member of UCSD's 
water ski team, was killed in a car 
accident Sept. 29 on his way to the 
water ski regional meet in 
Phoenix. 

Newell, 20, was driving 
through Gila Bend, Ariz., with four 
other students in the car when he 
went into the left lane, apparently 
thinking he was on a divided high-
way. When he realized he was in 
the path of oncoming traffic, he 
swerved to the right, then back to 
the left to keep from going off the 
road. He apparently overcorrected, 
causing his car to roll several 
times. 

According to Bill 
Schnciderwind, Newell's coach, 

Newell died approximately six 
minutes after the accident, with 
four of his teammates at his side. 

The passengers in Newell's car, 
juniors Tom Stout and Jodi 
Hottenstein, and freshmen Katie 
Ambrose and Peter Mehrhof, were 
airlifted to Phoenix hospitals. 
'There they would treated for 
minor injuries, held for precau-
tionary observations and released 
early the next morning. 

Harley Wallace, captain of the 
team, said Newell's biggest priority 
was helping his teammates. 

NHe cared more about his 
team's scores than his own," 
Wallace said. "Very few college 
skiers are like that. This guy cared 
more about his teammates than 
anyone else I've met."

High Speed Freeway Chase 
Enas at VA' Hospital 
Motorist has short stantkJjJ with police before 
surrendering at hospital where his mother works 
., PARltA UHARIAN 
Staff Writer . 

Police ended a car chase 
Monday when they stopped a 
motorist at the Veteran's Affairs 
Medical Center, where a 30-
minute standoff ensued. 

The driver and the police 
engaged in a short standoff at the 
hospital after the driver led them 
on a long freeway chase. 

VA police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said the motorist, 
Scott Garner, 25, was under sur-
veillance in a narcotics investiga-
tion when a narcotics detective 
requested marked units to pull 
the suspect over. 

"A narcotics detective wanted 
this man and his vehicle stopped: 
Robinson said. "But it's the police 
policy to have marked units to 

stop cars. " . 
According to Robinson, when 

the patrol officer attempted to 
stop a black 1997 Ford Mustang 
near Fairmount Avenue and 
Interstate 8 at 10:15 a.m. Monday, 
Gamer refused to stop. 

Garner drove dangerously 
and above the speed limit, travel-
ling on Interstate 8 and Interstate 
5, before finally stopping at the 
hospital, where his mother 
works, Robinson said. 

"Garner wouldn't yield to the 
officers: Robinson said. "He 
ended up running three or four 
stop signs during the chase." 

Garner was cornered by 
police in the parking lot of the 
hospital , but he rolled up his 
window and was seen talking on

about 30 students and community

banners printed with "UCSD

wearing large puppets symbollzmg

Brie Finegold, a principal mem-

"Basically, we're here because

Finegold said. Throughout the 

rally, the protesters were met by the 
stares of curious onlookers. 
Chanting such slogans as "Student 
needs, not corporate greed" and 
"Whose school? Our school," the 
protesters continued to make noise 
with the aid of makeshift drums and 
percussion instruments. When 
reaching the administration build-

delivered speeches.

Absence of Third 
Party Candidates 
Hurts Democracy 

The Commission on Presidential Debates 
is sadly perpetuating the' two-party, "lesser-
of-two-evils" system of voting that has char-
acterized American politics for decades. The 
Guardian feels that the debates should be 
opened up to include third-party candidates 
such as Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan. 

Tuesday night's presidential debate lacked 
surprise and spontaneity. The two major-
party candidates bickered over the same 
issues: taxes, education, the mnitary, etc. A 
wider debate would have included Nader 
and Buchanan injecting a more interesting 
variety of topics into the debate. 

The commission said it would only allow 
candidates who have at least 15 percent 
support in national polls to debate. But with 
such an entrenched two-party system, it is 
nearly impossible for minor candidates to 
receive such support before a debate. 

While Vice President Al Gore and Gov. 
George W Bush have a right to set up a 
debate that excludes other candidates, we find 
it cowardly on their part to exclude two can-
didates that are gaining nationwide attention. 

A Marist College Poll taken last week 
found that out of 588 likely voters nation-
wide, 53 percent supported allowing Nader 
and Buchanan into the debate. Also, a Fox 
News/Opinion Dynamics Poll taken in July 
found that out of 900 registered voters 
nationwide, 73 percent would find the 
debates more interesting if Nader and 
Buchanan were allowed to participate. 

In an age when Americans are often apa-
thetic about politics, it makes sense to give 
people some real choices in an election year. 
Shutting promising candidates out of a 
debate not only limits the choices voters 
have, but also limits the issues that get dis-
cussed. As a result, voters become disinter-
ested in the electoral process. 

Those who do vote often make their 
choice on a lesser-of-two-evils basis. 
Democracy should not be like that. People 
should vote for candidates they believe in. If 
Bush and .Gore are confident in their views 
and their debating skills, they should open 
the debates to promising candidates, espe-
cially when a majority of Americans are in 
favor of it. 

The Guardian, as a supporter of free 
speech and breadth of opinion, laments the 
fact that one politics-as-usual debate has 

. already taken place and calls upon Bush and 
Gore to stand up and face Nader and 
Buchanan in the next debates.

Candidates Face TIght Race In November, 
Students Should Cast Votes 

Closely contested races require greater student involvement as the fate of San 
Diego and the rest of the United States is in our hands 
By IRIAN ROBERTS and LAUREN 
STANLEY 
Special to the Guardian 

A lot of college students may be 
wondering, MWhy do so many people 
care if we vote in this electionr 
Everyone has seen the groups on' 
Library Walk, in the dorms and at cam-
pus meetings. 

They run after students with voter 
registration forms, they lure students with 
candy and refuse to give up. [t is clear that 
somebody out there really wants us to 
vote, but the !Juestion is: why? 

The quick and simple answer is that 
many elections this year will be close. 
Students who live at or near the UCSD 
are in one of the most hotly contested 
congressional districts in the country. 

. In 1.998, Republican Congressman 
Bnan Bllbray was re-elected by the slim 
margm of 3 percent, or 4,000 votes. This 
means that the student population of 
UCSD alone could have changed the 
outcome of the election. 

This year, the congressional race may 
be even closer. Bilbray is being chal-
lenged by UC graduate and current 
assemblywoman Susan Davis. 

Rece~t polls indicate that they are 
locked 10 a dead heat. Once again, 
UCSD students can determine the fate of 
this election. 

Why, if UCSD students have the 
ability to change the fate of San Diego 
elections, have we historically falled to 
vote? 

Many students say they would rather 
vote at home where they know the 
issues, but come on, how many people 
really follow through and vote by absen-
tee ballot? 

Besides, it is rather difficult to get 
information about candidates and initia-
tives near home because students do not 
have access to home newspapers, politi-
cal fliers and candidate forums. 

Furthermore, since students live in 
San Diego at least nine months out of 
the year, they are more impacted by 
policies set by San Diego lawmakers 

than those made by politicians else-
where, 

Our campus is a political center for 
San Diego. Each election year, numer-
ous debates and forums are held at 
UCSD. 

Over the past few years, we have 
seen everyone from President Clinton 
to local mayoral candidates speak on 
campus. On Oct. 25 there will be a 
mayoral debate between Bilbray and 
Davis in the Price Center Ballroom at 
6:30 p.m. 

It is pretty common these days to see 
candidates and their staff on call1pus 

The unfortunate truth is that 
our age group, US. citizens 
ages 18-24, is the most 
apathetic group of voters this 
nation has seen in a long 
time. Although we are active 
at school and in the 
community, we are completely 
absentfrom the political 
process . 

dis~b~ing literature and discussing 
,their views. For most students, this is 
the first time they have ever been able 
to interact face- to-face with elected 
officials. 

Although students may think they 
kn~ more about politics at home, in 
reality, connections on campus give us 
access to more information than we can 
get almost anywhere else. 

The unfort~nate truth is that our age 
group, u.s. citIZens ages 18 to 24, is the 

mo~t apathetic group of voters this 
nation has seen in a very long time. 
Although we are active at school and in 
the community, we are completely absent 
from the political process. 

At first we may think, "So what? How 
does this affect our liv.es?" 

Here is how: 
Political experts expect the next pres-

ident to appoint three to five new justices 
to the Supreme Court. The Roe v. Wade 
decision is currently being upheld in the 
Supreme Court by a margin of 5-4 votes. 
If the next president appoints even one 
anti-abortion justice to the court, 
women could lose the right to choose in 
the United States. This is a very real pos-
sibility. 

Access to higher education is at stake. 
Our federal' and state governments fund 
critical loan and grant programs. Those 
who depend on a Cal Grant, Perkins 
Loan or Stafford Loan should care who 
represents them in Sacramento and 
Washington. They need representatives 
who w~1I ~ake .sure these programs keep 
pace WIth mflauon and the cost of tuition. 

Anyone who cares about environ-
mental issues such as sewage-free beach-
es and clean air needs to vote for an envi-
r<?nmentally friendly Congress as well. To 
find out which candidates have the best 
environmental track record, look to 
groups such as our local Sierra Club to 
s«;e how they rate the candidates, 

One vote does matter, and the com-
bined impact of our student vote makes 
an enormous difference. Think about 
this: One vote gave Adolph Hitler control 
of the Nazi Party; one vote brought the 
state of Texas into the union; and one 
vote saved President Andrew Johnson 
from. being removed from the Oval 
CHfice . 

[t is absolutely critical that students 
of all party affiliations take just a few 
moments to vote on Nov. 7. There are 
two polling booths on campus, located 
at the Price Center and in the Muir 
Quad. Those not registered to vote ' in 
San Diego or who have recently 
changed addresses need to register by 
Oct, 10. 
. Students wanting information regard-
109 the status of their registration should 
call the County Registrar of Voters at 
(858) 565-5800. 

Together, we can make all the differ-
ence!

Controversial Abortion Pill Will Help Many 
Women Have An Option Besides Surgery . 
Recent FDA approval of drug is a milestone in abortion rights 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Senior'Staff Writer 

On Sept, 28 the Food and 
Drug Administration approved 
mifepristone, a drug commonly 
referred to as RU-486, RU-486 is 
a pill that expels an embryo from 
a pregnant woman in the early 
stages of her pregnancy. 

[ really cannot blame the 
drug'S distributor, Danco 
Laboratories, for trying to stay 
out of the public eye. With the 
threat of clinic-bombers and sur-
geon-snipers out there, it's a 
wonder Roussel Uclaf, the devel-
opers, even tried to bring it over 
from France. 

However, the FDA's approval 
of the drug may lower the occur-
rence of violent incidents, 

Since RU-486 is a pill, doc-
tors who prescribe the drug need 
not be surgeons. The FDA allows 
properly trained physicians to 
administer the drug if they can 
"accurately determine the dura -
tion of a patient's pregnancy and 
detect an ectopic [or tubal] preg-
nancy." 

This means that women will 
no longer have to go to abortion 
clinics unless there are complica-
tions with the drug's usage, low-
ering the risk of violence against 
them posed by ardent abortion 
foes. 

The so-called "abortion pill" 
has been available for about 10 
years in many countries includ-
ing France, Britain, Sweden and 
China. 

In the years of the drug's 
availability 10 Europe, the annu-
al abortion rate has not 

increased . In addition , the 
drug 's widespread usage has 
provided enough research data 
for scientists' to show to the 
FDA that RU-486 is safe to pre-
scribe. 

The FDA approved RU-486 
for use within 49 days of the 
woman's last menstrual period . 

RU-486 is an artificial 
steroid that blocks progesterone 
and prevents embryos from

with R U -486 are less 
risky than surgery. 

adhering to the uterine wall , [t 
is used in conjunction with 
misoprostol, a drug that 
induces contractions. A follow-
up examination is required 12 
days later. 

Misoprostol was already avail-
able in the United States for 
ulcer treatment, with a label 
warning pregnant women against 
its use. However, women have 
been obtaining misoprostol ille-
gally and using it for abortions, 
often overdosing or taking it late 
in pregnancy, resulting in partial 

abortions, which can cause inter-
nal bleeding. 

Opponents of RU-486 dwell 
too much on the side effects that 
affect very few women and are 
treatable with proper medical 
attention . Medical abortions per-
formed with RU-486 are less 
risky than surgery. They are 9S 
percen t effect ive and ca use 
excessive bleeding in only 2 per-
cent of women. The more com-
mon side effects are cramping, 
bleeding, diarrhea, nausea, vom-
iting, headache, dizziness, back 
pain and ti redness. 

The procedure resembles a 
miscarriage and is usually com-
pleted in four to 24 hours. Also, 
all physicians administering the 
drug are required to give their 
patients a medication guide that 
supplies important information 
about the drug, the procedure 
involved and the possible side 
effects of the drug. An online 
copy is avai lable at the FDA Web 
si t e, www.jda ,govlcderldrugl 
inJopage/mijepristone/medguide, htm. 

Much of the debate over the 
drug centers on politics, 
Presidential cand idates Vice 
President AI Gore and Gov. 
George W Bush are split on the 
issue. Gore supports availability 
of the drug, Bush opposes it, 
stating: "It's abortion." 

Nothing less can be expected 
from Bush and the Republ ican 
Party based on its long-held party 
line against a woman's right to 
choose. 

Still, some proponents of RU-

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Upon Graduation, Seniors Must Choose 
Whether to go to Graduate School 
Writer faces the daunting task of preparing for graduate school 
after surviving four years at UCSD 
By KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

Having entered my senior 
year of college, I am faced with 
the daunting prospect of the 
future. 

Deep down, I knew it 'Vould be 
there awaiting me, but good old 
youthful denial prevented me 
from actually preparing for it. 

Now it seems I have no choice. 
The graduation ceremony is in 
June and, assuming I pass all my 
classes and don't miss any 
requirements (cross your fingers). 
I Will be there. Where 1 will be 
after that is an entirely different 
question. . 

After preschool , there was 
kindergarten, followed byelemen-
tary school. Then came the 
j un ior- high - hell ish -a wkward 
years, then high school, then -
for most of you reading this -
college. The progression seemed 
natural and more or less pre-
dictable with the exception of 
some question marks hovering 
over the transition between high 
school and college. 

Having been a student fO'r as 
far back as I can remember, life 
without the structure of academia 
is a perplexing concept. 

Sure, exams are scary, but in a 
strange way, the absence of 

exams and the absence of a clear 
marker of progress and standing 
is scarier. 

Metaphorical phrases like the 
"daily grind" and "climbing the 
corporate ladder" are employed to 
describe the arduous nature of 
coping in the real world. 

There is one possible alterna-

Going to graduate school 
requires, first and 
foremost a strong 
dedication to learning 
not as a means to an 
end, but as an end in 
itself. 
tive to entering that world; a 
haven for oddballs like myself: 
graduate school. To go or not to 
go? That is the question. . 

Considering that applications 
are due within the next few 
months, it is quite a dilemma. It is . 
a given that if you want to special-
ize in some kind of scientific field 
or become a doctor, your educa-
tion does not stop when your 
undergraduate years are complete. 
Similarly, if you want to be the 
next Michael Eisner, you probably 

have business school in the 
future. 

But liberal arts folks like myself 
do not always need a graduate 
education to lure them into the 
higher echelons of academics. For 
US; the decision to go on to grad-
uate school is based heavily upon 
weighing a pure love of learning 
against the question of if it is 
worth the hassle financially, men-
tally or otherwise. 

People say "you can always 
apply and see what happens,· but 
take a moment to think back to 
high school and remember the 
application process for college. 
Applying is not an easy task, and 
the motivation needed to under-
take it will not be there unless a 
certain level of comminnent to 
moving on to the next level of 
learning is present. The applica-
tion fees, personal data forms, let-
ters of recommendation and 
statements of purpose constitute 
just some of the items on the 
graduate school application 
checklist. 

Of course, if you thought your 
days of standardized testing were 
over when you took the SAT, 
there is the GRE to keep you up 
at night, threatening to fry your 
mind with geometric equations

Dear Editor, 
We think it's important to 

inform our fellow students about 
legislation currently going 
through Congress. 

Our Congressman Brian 
Bilbray recently vote.d against 
pro-choice legislation and sup-
ported cuts of student loan 
money. 

One issue that directly affects 

the lives of many students at 
UCSD and other universities is 
that Bilbray recently 'supported a 
$10 billion cut of student loan 
money over seven years. 

This money, in turn, will go to 
tax cuts for the wealthiest 20 per-
cent of Americans. 

Bilbray voted against reducing 
class sizes in elementary schools 
and voted to cut Head Start, the 
highly esteemed program that aims 
to help promising underprivileged 
young students. 

With these votes Bilbray has 
proven time and again that educa-
tion is not one of his priorities. 

Although Bilbray claims that 
the federal government should stay 
out of the debate on abortion, he 
opposed heal'th plans that would 
cover abortions for federal employ-
ees, and opposed privately funded 
abortions in overseas military hos-
pitals. 

Bilbray also claims to be pro-
choice, but he opposes late-term 
abortions in instances where the 
life of the mother would be 
irreparably harmed. 

Needless to say, Bilbray has an 
unacceptably low support level -
45 percent - from the National 
Abortion Rights Action League. 

We believe that these facts prove 
Bilbray to be a man who says one 
thing and does another, and we 
think it's every student's right to 

~now the truth about our con-
gressman.

Seniors face difficult 
decision 

and words that you would bet 
money on are not part of the 
English language. No doubt, the 
application process is draining 
and time-consumi~g for students 
who have enough to worry about 
as it is. 

So, instead of diving headlong 
into the applications, take some 
time to consider if you really want 
to go. 

The main issue is motiv~. If you 
get an overwhelming sense of 
dread thinking about spending 
even more time in school but ratio-
nalize that you should in order to 
secure the higher degree, do not 
put in the effort needed to apply -
at least not right now. First and 
foremost, going to graduate school 
requires a strong dedication to 
learning, not as' a means to an end, 
but as an end in itself.

the Cht Cafe. We are fortunate the 
DJ and Vinylphiles Club has done a 
good job promoting and organizing 
these raves. I can't think of another 
campus that has done as well with

There are a myriad of political

Palestinians and Israelis Continue Talks 
on Cease-Fire Agreement 

PARlS - After more than 12 
hours of stormy talks, the Israeli 
and Palestinian leaders and 
Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright were still struggling early 
Thursday to reach an agreement 
on how to stop the violence that 
has torn through Israel and the 
Palestinian territories, a senior 
Clinton administration official 
said. . 

The State Department 
spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, 
said early on Thursday that 
despite continuing "intense dis-
cussions" that began at 10 a.m . . 
Wednesday, the United States was 
not "laying claim to any agree-
ment: 

Albright summoned the Israeli 
prime minister, Ehud Barak, and 
the Palestinian leader, Yasser 
Arafat. to Paris to try to dampen 
the violence that has resulted in 
the deaths of more than 60 
Palestinians and threatens . to 
unravel many of the gains made 
over the last seven years of Middle 
East peacemaking by the Clinton 
administration. 

Is-raeli officials were reported to 
have agreed to withdraw heavy 
armaments from the West Bank 
and Gaza, but that part of the 
overall accord that Albright was 
aiming for was not formalized by 
the parties, American officials 
said. 

There were also reports that 
the Palestinians would agree to 
stay away from two flash points 
in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip. 

According to accounts from 
diplomats involved in what turned 
into a chaotic flurry of talks, the 
major sticking point was how an 
investigation should be conducted 
into the bloodlening and who 
would conduct it. 

Arafat stood by his insistence 
that an investigation should be 
international in character, and 
preferably involve the United 
Nations, while Barak was opposed 
to that, diplomats said. 

Egypt's president, Hosni 
Mubarak, who has been one of 
Arafat's key allies but also heads 
the first Arab country to sign a 

peace treaty with Israel, said he 
planned to meet later on 
Thursday with Arafat, Barak and 
Albright. 

The violence continued in the 
Palestinian territories on 
Wednesday and spread beyond 
the borders of Israel and the 
Palestinian territories. In 
Mubarak's capital, Cairo, and in 
the Syrian capital, Damascus, 
thousands of university students 
protested the deaths of 
Palestinians. 

In Cairo, about 1,500 students 
stoned a supermarket belonging 
to the British retail company 
Sainsbury's, asserting that the 
owner is Jewish. In Damascus, 
university students pelted the 
U.S. Embassy with stones, 
branches and rubbish. And in the 
Jordanian capital of Amman, 

. police fired tear gas and used 
batons to disperse about 800 peo-
ple who tried to march on the 
Israeli Embassy.

California Reports School Improvements 
TIed to Incentive Program 

LOS ANGELES -In the first 
year of a California program that 
ties academic performance to 
financial rewards for public 
schools and educators, two-thirds 
of the state's public schools 
showed improvement on tests 
that provide the basis of the pro-
gram, officials announced on 
Wednesday. 

Seventy-one percent of the 
6,815 schools eligible to partici-
pate met their targets and 67 per-
cent of those are now in line for 
about $660 million in awards. 

"This shows that if you give 
people a real target they'll reach it," 
said Delaine Eastin, state superin-
tendent for public instruction. 

Although officials said the 
improvements were encouraging, 
the program resulted in incidents 
of cheating at a small number of 
schools and concerns about the 
limited criteria on which the per-
formance index is based. 

Eastin played down the cheat-
ing. but agreed with critics who 
said that the index should be 
based on criteria beyond one 
standardized test. 

"We are at the very first step of 
a longer journey and, honestly, I 
would have waited until there was 
more than one in dice in the' 
index," Eastin said. 

The Academic Performance 
Index is the cornerstone of the 
1999 Public Schools 
Accountability Act, which estab-
lished a statewide system examin-
ing schools and gauging their 
improvement. 

NIt just makes a lot of 
educators nervous that 
cash bonuses of up to 
$25,000 for an 
individual teacher are 
going to flow based upon 
a single measure that is 
not even linked to the 
curriculum. " 

IInIce fill .. 
UC Berkeley Teacher 

The index is tied to the results 
of Stanford 9 achievement tests, 
pegging them to a scale ranging 
from 200 to 1,000. A statewide 
performance target of 800 was 
established and every school 
below that level must improve its 
performance by 5 percent and 
show comparable improvement 

for ethnic and socioeconomically 
disadvantaged groups within the 
school. Those over 800 must 
show a one-point gain to be eligi-
ble for awards. 

Those who meet the goals are 
eligible for three types of awards. 
The Governor's Performance 
Award offers up to $150 per stu-
dent to schools that meet their 
goal. The School Site Employee 
Performance Bonus divides $350

But some education experts 
voiced concern about the con-
cept. 

Bruce Fuller, a professor of 
education and public policy at 
the University of California 
Berkeley said: "It just makes a lot 
of educators nervous that cash 
bonuses of up to $25,000 for an 
individual teacher are going to 
flow based upon a single measure 
that is not even linked to the cur-
riculum."

Police officials have denied

Giuliani to discuss their finclings 
and perhaps to negotiate a set of 
changes that would avert a lawsuit, 
the officials said. 

If the talks fail, the officials 
said, prosecutors could seek 
authOrization from Attorney 
General Janet Reno to go to court 
under civil rights law and ask a 
judge to order broad changes in 
the operations of the Street Crime 
Unit and possible oversight by a 
federal monitor. 

Prosecutors have based their 
findings on a statistical analysis of 
the Street Crime Unit's searches of 
people its officers had stopped 
because they were suspected of 
committing crimes or carrying 
guns, one official said. The analysis 
concluded that blacks and 
Hispanics in the city were dispro-
portionately singled out in the 
searches, and that the imbalance 
could not be explained by the fact 
that the city's minority neighbor-
hoods typically had higher crime 
rates. 

Mary Jo White, the U.S. attor-
ney for the Southern District of 
New York, whose office made the 
finding, would not comment 
other than to say her office's 
investigation was continuing.

ment efforts to brin~ the Suharto 
family and the militias to justice, 
underscoring the difficulty of this 
impoverished country's struggle to 
forge a democracy after decades of 
authoritarian rule. 

After returning from an over-
seas trip on Wednesday, Wahid said 
he would not grant clemency to 
Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala 
Putra, whom the Supreme Court 
has sentenced to 18 months in 
prison for his role in a multi-mil-
lion-dollar land scam. 

The son, who is known as 
Tommy Suharto, admitted his guilt 
on Thesday and pleaded for a pres-
idential pardon to avoid jail. 

The president replied. "No; 
when asked by reporters if he 
would intervene on behalf of 
Tommy Suharto, whom he has also 
accused of being behind a recent 
series of bomb attacks in Jakarta

ed to derail a separate corruption 

counsel's office also would not 
comment. 

Giuliani and police officials 
have in the past adaman t1y rejected 
allegations that officers engaged in 
racial profiling. 

They did so most specifically 
when New York state Attorney 
General Elio,t L. Spitzer issued a 
report late last year saying that the 
department's street search tactics 
unfairly sinsled out the city's black 
and HispaniC residents. 

The Street Crime Unit -
squads of elite. undercover officers 
that were sent into high-crime sec-
tions of the city - was seen by the 
department as one of its great suc-
cesses, the unit's ability to get guns 
off the street having played a [a1e 
role in the broader reductions In 
violent crime. 

But the performance and con-
duct of the unit came under 
intense scrutiny after Diallo, an 
unarmed African immigrant, was 
shot to death on a Bronx street by 
four members of the unit. While 
the four officers were ultimately 
acquitted of any crime, the Police 
Department did significantly reor-
ganize the Street Crime Unit. and 
ordered many of its officers into 
uniform. 

Justice Department officials in 
Washington have yet to announce 
whether they wi 1.1 seek criminal 
civil rights charges against the four 
officers who shot Diallo.

Pharmaceutical Companies Push Pills With Piles of Money 
Before the Olympic Games 

opened in Sydney, the aging gold 
medalists Bruce Jenner, Dorothy 
Hamill and Ban Conner were talk-
ing more about their arthritis than 
the coming events. 

All three ath letes are being paid 
by either Merck or Pharmacia to 
speak about the new prescription 
pain relievers that they are taking 
for their sore joints. 

The testimonials are part of one 
of the fiercest and most expensive 
battles now being waged in the 
pharmaceutical business: the war 
between Merck's VioJO( and 
Pharmacia 's Celebrex. Since last 
year, Merck and Pharmacia have 

each been spending tens of mil-
lions of dollars a month on mllrket-
ing. 

The money is paying for adve r-
tisements, for stipends to doctors 
to speak on behalf of the drugs 
and for rriillions of free samples of 
the medications, known as Cox-2 
inhibitors. Each side now has 
more than 4,000 representatives 
visiting doctors to promote the 
drugs. 

In ' the history of the pharma-
ceutical industry, no other drugs 
have earned more money for their 
makers in their ~rst year on the 
market. not even the anti-impo-
tence drug Viagra. The companies 

expect to sell about $4 billion 
wonh of the painkillers this year. 

The new paio relievers are 
considered a breakthrough by 
many doctors because, even 
though they have not been shown 
to relieve pain any better than 
drugs like ibuprofen, they appear 
to have fewer side effects. 

Studies by the companies have 
found the Cox-2 inhibitors lower 
the risk of ulcers, a rare but dan-
gerous side effect of anti - inflam-
matory pain relievers like aspirin 
and ibuprofen. 

The Food and Drug 
Administration, however, still 
requires the companies to warn 

patients that the new drugs could 
cause ulcers. 

American sales of anti-inflam-
matory pain relievers, inclu~ing 
Cox-2 drugs, rose 65 percent in 
the last 12 months, to $4.5 billion, 
according to IMS Health. The 
surge in sales came soon after the 
FDA approved Celebrex on Dec. 
31 , 1998. Pharmacia's marketing 
was so effective that by the time 
the FDA approved VioJO(, in May 
1999, doctors and consumers 
were well versed in the benefits of 
the Cox-2 drugs, making Merck 's 
job easier. 

Physicians have found them-
selves in the middle of the battle-

ground. Dr. Randy Sassich, a resi -
dent in · internal medicine at 
Barnes-Jewish Hospital in SI. 
Louis, said that after Vioxx was 
approved in May 1999. he sud-
denly saw more Celebrex samples 
in the hospital. One resident was 
carrying a box of Celebrex sam-
ples the size of a microwave oven, 
he said. 

He said that a representative 
froll) one company had suggested 
his competitor was suppressing a 
study. °It's competitive and ugly; 
Sasslch said.

Dartmouth Sees Surge in Student SID Cases 
HANOVER, N.H.-

Dartmouth College Health 
Services has seen an upsurge in 
the number of reponed cases of 
chlamydia and gonorrhea over the 
past six months, especially since 
the beginning of fall term. 

Despite ca mpus rumors that 
blame the class of 2004 for the 
rise in cases, Director of the 
Women's Health Program Ja nice 
Sundnas said she could not 
attribute the recent upswing in 
reported cases to anyone group of 
students. 

She called pointing fingers in 
the case of sexually transmitted 
diseases "unethical." 

Sundnas said students at the 
college have to understand that 
Dartmouth is far from STD-free. 

"There are a lot of students 
on campus who really do not 
think that there are sexually 
transmitted diseases at 
Dartmouth," she said, explaining 
that ev~n though the college is in 
the Ivy League, it is not immune 
to STDs. 

"They're equal opportunity," 
she said of the diseases. 

Despite her reluctance to 
release the statistics of reported 
incidents of STDs, Sundnas said 
cases were not in the range. of 
hundreds. 

"Students go on leave terms, 
they go home, they go away, they 
see people, they have unprotected 
intercourse and they bring it back 
to campus. There are many places 
for students to contract sexually 
transmitted diseases," she said of 
the possible sources. 

Sundnas said the STDs on 
campus range from Herpes to 
Human Papillomavirus to 
chlamydia. 

"All of the sexually transmitted 
diseases that you find in the gen-
eral public are here at 
Dartmouth." she said. 
. HQw,evcr, the recent spike in 

cases has upped the number of 

chlamydia and gonorrhea - the 
first and second most common 
STDs in the nation, respectively. 

Chlamydia, a sexually trans-
mitted bacterial infection, is fou r 
times more common than gonor-
rhea and 30 times more common 
than syphilis. And for every per-
son with herpes, there are six with 
chlamydia. 

Typically, chlamydia has no 
symptoms, but when there are 
signs, they appear five to 10 days 
after infection. For women, they 

Sundnas said students at 
the college have to 
understand that 
Dartmouth is far from 
STD-free. 
include bleeding, abdominal pain, 
painful intercourse. fever, painful 
urination, cervical inflammation 
and abnormal discharge. For men, 
symptoms include pus or milky 
discharge, pain while urinating 
and swollen testicles. 

However, Sundnas emphasized 
that the majority of cases are 
undetectable. 

"Unfortunately, many women 
don't have symptoms; she said, 
explaining that most cases are 
discovered in routine screenings 
or after previous partners have 
told them that they were infect-
ed. 

Chlamydia is spread by vaginal 
and anal intercourse. It can also 
spread from a mother to her baby 
during birth. 

Young adults - people in the 
under-25 bracket, specifically -
have the highest rates of chlamy-
dia. Untreated, chlamydia can lead 
to pelvic inflammatory disease , 
which causes chronic pelvic:; I?ain 
and harm to ·, the e,.-oCiucIM 
organs. 

Sundnas said infertility is a 
common result of chlamydia. 

"If you have chlamydia and it is 
not treated , and you develop 
pelvic inflammatory disease, there 
is nothing we can do about that," 
Sundnas said. 

Both chlamydia and gonorrhea 
are trea table with antibioti cs. 

The incidence of gonorrhea is 
highest in high-density urban 
areas among people under 24 
years old who have multiple sex 
partners and engage in unprotect-
ed sexual intercourse. 

Sundnas said mO$t STDs are 
preventable when people use 
latex condoms during sex - both 
oral sex and intercourse. She said 
binh control pills do not guard 
against STDs. 

"All these people who got it 
were hav ing unprotected sex," 
she said of the stud en ts who had 
come in to Health Services 
recently with gonorrhea and 
chlamydia. . 

Sundnas said the best way to 
guard against sexually transmitted 
diseases is abstinence, but she 
said condoms are very effective as 
well. 

"It's a reasonable amount of 
protection against no protection 
at all; she said. 

Sundnas said there was a "lit-
tle bump in the number of '04 
students who were coming in; 
but that it is still too early in the 
term to know if that trend will 
continue or if it was merely an 
aberration. 

Sexual Abuse Awareness 
Program Coordinator Susan 
Marine also denied the incoming 
class was . to blame for the 
increased cases. Although she 
heard rumors from a number of 
students that there had been a 
spike in cases of STDs in the '04 
class, they were only that -
rumors.

Quin said the College Board

T 

t the tender age of 
three, Fall Fest is 
quickly carving out 
its own identity as 
one ofUCSD's three 

main festivals. Pulling away from 
its more prominent siblings, Win-
terfest and Sun God, this year's fes-
tival is looking to be more popular 
than last year's, which had more 
than 2,000 in attendance. But, the 
question as to how loud it will wail, 
whether there will be cheers or 
jeers, remains the key question. 

The birth of FallFest came in 
1998 and catered to a relatively 
small crowd with Let's Go Bowl-
ing, Wailing Souls and Spearhead. 
Fall Fest '99 featured the Untouch-
ables, Eek-a-Mouse and closed 
'with a high-energy set from Save ' 
Ferris. 

With an anticipated crowd of 
nearly 5,000 students, Fa II Fest

Long Beach Dub Allstars 
shed their Sublime image 
ContInued from ...,. U 
dition of headlining different genres, 
upperclassmen will be glad to see 
that neither Save Ferris nor Eek -a-
Mouse will be appearing for their 
umpteenth time. Besides, anyone can 
catch Eek riding his bicycle in Mis-
sion Beach any time of the day. 

Wailing Souls and Spearhead 
made for an impressive reggae con-
cert but failed to capture UCSD's 
· whole" community with the lack of 
any mainstream acts. The overplayed 
radio bands of FallFest '99 brought 
in a large and diverse .crowd but 
missed any sense of unity, as droves 
of pop-reggae fans herded to the 
back door and pseudo-ska heads 
jumped to the front. 

FallFest 2000 offers a(l eclectic 
palane this year but keeps an overall 
rap/reggae/rock feel to keep the 
masses unified and satiated. 

The blueprint for this year's 
FaIlFest seems to be a solution to 
previous years' woes of staging an 
all-campus event that would appeal 
to the whole community. Whether 
such a festival is possible with such a 
large population will be seen this Fri-
day. 

The most attractive element to 
this festival. however, lies in the inti-
macy created by the Price Center's 
relatively small venue. [t isn't as cozy 
as the Belly Up Tavern or the Cas-
bah, but it definitely cowers under 
RlMAC's magnitude. 

The Bands: 

Long Beach Dub AUstars 
Tune a1otted: 1 hour, 10 min-

Bio: The Long Beach Dub AJI-

stars consist in part of the two origi-
nal members of Sublime, Eric Wil-
son on bass and Bud Gaugh on 

drums. The rest of the group, rising 
from LBC, are longtime friends as 
well as obvious supporters of Sub-
lime. Opie Ortiz is on lead vocals and 
is backed up by RAS-1 on guitar and 
Jack Maness on keyboard. Marshall 
Goodman is behind the decks and 
Tim Wu takes care of the sax and 
flute work. 

The Dub Allstars were born in 
the wake of tragedy after Sublime 
frontman Brad Nowell died from an 
accidental overdose. This was mere 
weeks before Sublime's epic self-
titled release. Sublime had built a 
loyal following with their indie 
releases "40 Oz. to Freedom" and 
"Robbin' the Hood." 

The surviving members of Sub-
lime disappeared from the scene for 
close to a year before Long Beach 
Dub AIIstars formed. playing their 
first gig at a benefit concert for Now-
ell's son. Jakob. After recruiting the 
final members, the Dub Allstars 
soon went on tour and fina lly 
released their own material: "Long 
Beach Dub AIIstars and Friends" in 
1998 and "Right Back" in 1999. 

WHAT TO EXPECf: Long 
Beach Dub A1lstars have slowly been 
shedding the flak that they are a trib-
ute band to Sublime. With an eclec-
tic ensemble. the Dub AJlstars com-
bine a blend of reggae. punk, hip hop 
and jazz. They have been known to 
playa few Sublime classics, but look 
for them to impress the masses with 
their own unique sound.

.,....,: The multiracial, multitalented Dial-7 brings their socUU, spiritual and strntwise message to open 
FaUFest 2000 in the Pritt Center. 

Fall Fest: 
Mix Master Mike scratched 
his way to three world titles 

_ ~ed frOlll .,... 12 
He played at weddings and house parties 

before running away from home to join a 
mobile DJ business in Sacramento. 
- Mike won three world titles in the early 
'90s and he has since worked with the 
Beastie Boys and has recently released 
"Eye Uv The Cyclops EP." 

WHAT TO EXPECT: Mix Master 
Mike has been scratching for well over a 
decade. In that time he has compiled three 
world titles, inspiring the likes of DJ Q-Bert-
He is the DJ for the Beastie Boys. And 
c'mon. the kid ran away from home to be a 
Dj. . 

Master Mike's set usually lasts for about 
an hour, so the given . 45 minutes should 
allow for an even more frenzied pace and 
rhthym. 

Steven Lord. However, the rest of Dial-7 
carried on. Older brother Michael Lord and 
his friend Shauny B. are the vocalists and 
masters of ceremony for the group. They are 
backed by , their bassist Barrett. guitarist 
Chris Robosan and drummer Mikey Clarnz. 

In the mid '90s the members of Dial-7 
moved in together at an artist colony in 
Laguna Canyon. Calif .. where they sharp-
ened their act by gening gigs anywhere they 
could. It was during this time the group offi-
cially took the name Dial-7, which symbol-
izes the creative and spiritual force associat-
ed with the number seven. 

Inspired and pushed by the memory of 
Steven Lord, Dial-7 has grown to become a 
definitive part of the Orange County music 
scene. Dial-Ts wide range of sound has 
allowed them to perform alongside groups 
like Run DMC. De La Soul. Foo Fighters. 
Incubus, Unwritten Law and Suicidal Ten-
dencies. 

WHAT TO EXPECf: Dial-7 will kick 
off Fall Fest 2000 with an eclectic and high-
strung set. Their positive and unique sound 
has been described as Hendrix-esque hard 

DiaI-7 rock mixed with rap and reggae. The music 
Tune a1otted: 45 minutes is powered with ingenious lyrics by the 
Bio: Dial-7 also rose from the tragic socially conscience minds of Michael Lord

14 HIATUS The UCSD Guardian 

Good For the Mind, Heart and Belly 
Galoka brings some truth to La Jolla in the form of food, fine art and jazz. 
By LINDSAY SWORSKI 
Hiatus Editor 

Forget what I said a few articles 
ago abollt the banality and bore-
dom of La jolla. I forgot, in my rash 
judgment, that there is always a sil-
ver lining, always a diamond in the 
supposed ruff. 

One f these undeniable gems 
is Galoka. just as the owners Preet . 
and Vikas Srivastava would have it, 
their place is hard to define; part 
gourmet restaurant, part fine arts 
ga llery, part living-jazz-hip-hop-
experimental venue, part home. It 
is a home for the people who have 
helped (0 crea te the place. and that 
feeling extends to those who enter. 
Galoka is actually more of an expe-
rience than a place. It is happen-
ing. 

her I was writing an article. I com-
mented on the genius of the art. 
food and music setup. "Yes," she 
said. "this place is great, especially 
with the Indian perspective. It is 
really ... needed." 

After she brought us glasses of 
the house wine. ( began to look at 
the menu . The prices are up there 
- abollt $11 per entree - bu t I 
could already tell by the quality of 
the wine that the food was going to 
be good. Sixty to 98 percent of the 
ingredients are organic, only unre-
tined canola and olive oils are used 
and Galoka claims every dish 
includes Indian ayurvedic healing 
herbs and spices. 

I am a typical struggling stu-
dent. but from time to time ( 
enjoy giving my money for the 
support of quality. The price of 
dinner includes the after-dinner 
music as well. Only rarely is there 
a cover charge even if you don't 
get dinner, and then it's usually 
only $5. 

Thursday, October 5, 2000 

My friend and I arrived for our 
dinner reservations at 7:30 p.m. 
just as the sun was setting. Preet 
seated us at a small window table 
covered with white cloth and fra-
grant flower petals, situated on the 
north side of the building. (The 
south room is where the musicians 
play and the bartender bartends 
later in the night, starting at 9:30 
p.m.) 

Quality is at the root of every-
thing going on at Galoka - quali-
ty, health, art, pleasure. There is 
fine art for the eyes, healthy food 
for the body. music for the ears. 
Preet and Vikas run Galoka with 
environmental impact in mind as 
well as inner fulfillment. I know 
that sounds like a hell of a lot for a 
restaurant. a gallery, or a club in La 
jolla to take on, but they do a pret-
ty good job. 

Bnan Moghadam/ Guardian 
.All tIIst jazz: GaJolw offers traditional vegetarian Indian dishes with a toudl of Ethiopian, fuuvian and IUUian inj1uence .. There is a 
great uariety of jazz and aperimental music almost every night of the week as ~Il as an open mil and artist's sessWn. 

Preet's brother Vikas brought 
us the menus. The colors in the 
room were warm and rich. and 
good jazz played over hidden 
speakers. Paintings and sketches 
lined the walls and there was a coat 
rack holding beautiful (ndian 
dresses. The smells were rich as 
well - incense, wine and curry 
spices - and so was Preet's voice. 

"My brother Vikas does the jazz 
- ( can tell you about the art and 
food: she explained, when I told 

. "(t 's hard in La Jolla. but ('ve 
got to put my foot down: Vikas 
passionately told me. "People ask 
me, 'Why don 't you serve 
meat?' .. . Do you even have to 
ask?" 

The wine started to kick in a bit 

more. My friend and I decided to 
take a walk around the restaurant 
while waiting for our food. We 
looked at the art and realized that it 
was Preet's. She studied at the Art 
Academy of San Francisco and 
uses the space at Galoka to show 
and sell some of her work: oils, pas-
tels, charcoals, watercolors and 
mixed media. 

Vikas went to UCSD and 
worked under jazz master James R. 
Cheatham before getting his mas-

Our food arrived, so we sat back 
down. 

First we got some yummy fried 
balls of veggies breaded in gram. I

really good when dipped in the

Music and food that is

Continued from paCe 14 
ence is even better. Preet does her 
art, Vikas does his music and the 
whole family comes together to run 
the project. 

"My mother, father, brother and 
sister all work here," Preet said. 
"There are also a few other people 
who have been with us for 15 years. 
Everyone is included: friends, 
boyfriends, girlfriends - it's hard 
to distinguish after all this time. 
Everyone is family. And all in the 
restaurant business ... I don't know 
about that ," she smirked with eye-
brows raised. 

The menu states, uGaloka is 
both a representation of the cul-
tures present within the American 
paradigm, as well as a retleClion of 
the complexity and depth of any 

cultur~ in a global transition." 
Vikas explained further. "What 

is diversity? It's bullshit. Diversity 
is a way of categorizing other cul-
tures based on the ideals, standards 
of your own. This place goes 
beyond that. [ am Indian. Yes. But [ 
am not Indian, I'm a jazz player. 
But I'm not a jazz player. These are 
all words, titles - when [ would try 
to te ll people ' I'm Indian' they 
would tell to me to get off it. But 
when I play jazz, when I do an Indi-
an rhythm, people love it. They ask 
for more. People experience all that 
I am in an instant. In art one fi nds 
expression that goes beyond cate-
gories. It turns one's true self into 
something that can be experi-
enced." 

Preet brings Ethiopian, Italian 
and Peruvian influences to the tra-
ditional Indian dishes served in a

California style. She shows herself 
in her art. Vikas brings many differ-
ent cultural influences into his own 
music and opens his space up to 
many other bands with their own 
influences. 

As we finished di nner, my 
friend and I heard music starting 
in the other room. We found a 
table close to the small stage and 
had our dessert over there. I ate 
my amazing vegan chocolate 
mousse and drank my chai tea

Review: ~~~[l1J[I~ 

Debelah Morgan 
Dance With Me 

Atlantic 

B 
Don't let her fnt single and the 

title track, MDance With Me," mis-
lead you. On Debelah Morgan's 

~ir.d album, you'll find her pop 
endeavors go much farther than 
today's infatuation with Ricky Mar-
tin, even if it seems to be dissipat-
ing of late. MDance With Me" 
revives the notion of pop-soul in a 

clean, studio-perfected fashion . 
The second track, M[ Remember," 

encompasses everything that is light 
pop - a swift-footed beat, simple 
layered background vocals and obe-
dient keyboard melodies. "Baby I 
Need Your Love" follows suit, pro-
viding typical love song lyrics and a 
straightforward chorus you'll be 
singing along with in no time. 

There is a little extra something 
to be reckoned with - Mpop funk: 
if you will - on a. couple of the' 
tracks. MLet's Get [t On" has a 
catchy beat-driven guitar melody 
that just might make you reach for 
that repeat button. MI Can't Stop 
Loving You" combines sultry piano 
playing with a subtle background 
of electronic unrest. Interestingly 
enough, it works. 

No doubt, Morgan has her 
influences. You feel a little Motown 
through the album. [n particular, 
MTake The Rain Away" sounds 
strikingly similar to Cheryl Lynn's 
"Got To Be Real." And you can't 
help but think of Mariah Carey 
when you hear Morgan showcase 
the upper part of her five-octave 
range. Like Carey, Morgan's vocal 
talents really shine through on her 

The UCSD Guardian 

slow tracks, which include "Close 
To You," "What Would You Do," 

.and MBring Back the Sun." 
"Dance With Me" is fluffy with 

pop and a little R&B. It does, howev-
er, come off sounding a little too per-
fect at times. Still, Morgan's voice 
resembles the fervor of Carey in her 
pre-diva years. Morgan has that 
unique gift of carrying a simple pop 
melody, trite lyrics and all, and mak-
ing it her own.

Like many others, I prefer my 

hardcore punk rock loud, hard and 
fast. It's a simple formula, and 
many bands do it quite well. That 's 
because it's not very hard to do. 
Just mix a little standard teenage 
"I'm pissed at society" angst with 
three chords, tell the drummer to 
pretend he's two lines away from a 
meth overdose, and come up with a 
reasonably catchy yet indiscernible 
chorus. 

Repeat this process ad nauseum 
from anywhere between 30 sec-
onds and two minutes, and 'voila -
a hardcore punk song is born. A 
chorus of rowdy adolescent fans 
singing along with every verse is 
often added as an extra touch, 
especially on so-called "live" 
albums. 

This might prompt one to ask: 
just how many variations on this 
theme can a band go through 
before its audience gives up on it 
entirely? [n the case of 7 Seconds, 
the answer to this question seems 

HIATUS 17 

to be 20 years and counting. How 
can th is be? Wouldn 't people get 
tired of seeing and hearing the 
same crappy pseudo-musical 30-
second performances over and over 
again? Of course they would, and 
they regularly do. 

The key to 7 Seconds' success 
is the continuously renewable 
supply of mohawked, leather-clad, 
jaded, nihilistic, suburba n 
teenagers who are inexplicably 
drawn to aggressive cacophonies 
of all kinds. Kids will always want 
to piss off thei r parents with loud 
abrasive music. They'll also be 
willing to thr~w down quite a bit 
of thei r abundant disposable 
income in order to procure this 
music, ensuring job security for 
hardcore punk bands for years to 
come. 

"Scream Real Loud ... Live!" is

Albums: 
Back to the roots of reggae 
with Dennis E. Brown 
ContInued from ..... 17 

ican culture by playing the same 
songs over and over again to dissat-
isfied teenagers, and you can tell it's 
gening old. 

If you're a die-hard 7 Seconds 
fan, and if 17 previous albums by 
this group didn't sate your appetite 
for that raw, riotous, oh-so-unique 
7 Seconds sound, then by all 
means, pick this one up. Otherwise, 
you might as well just pop in the 
old Minor Threat, sit back, and 
wait for something new. 

- Sky Frostenson 

Dennis Emmanuel 
Brown 

May Your Food Basket 
Never Empty 
Ras Records 

A 
Simply put, Dennis E. Brown 

was one of the most popular and 
influential reggae icons in history. 
Often referred to as the "Crown 
Prince of Reggae," Brown was Bob 
Marley's favorite singer. He began 
his career as a teen-ager in 1968, 
ultimately recording more than 50 
albums and a number of hit songs 
prior to his untimely death due to 
respiratory failure at the age of 42 
on July 1, 1999. 

With so much popularity and 
so many albums to his name, it 
isn't surprising to see this collec-
tion of previously recorded tracks 
released nearly a year after his 
death . It is surprising, however, to 
note just how good this album is, 
especially given the abundance of 
mediocre Brown recordings on 
various labels with various pro-
ducers. 

"May Your Food Basket Never 
Empty" is comprised entirely of 
previously released tracks record-
ed with musician and producer 
Errol Flabba Holt. The two were 
good friends, and their chemistry 
is evident throughout the album. 

Brown is at his vocal best on 
each track, and it wouldn 't be 
going too far to dub each one a 
classic. His versions of Israel 
Vibration's "Same Song" and Ken 
Booth 's "Just Another Girl" are far 
better than the originals, and it's 
simply inconceivable to imagine 
these recordings of his own songs 
ever being improved upon. The 
album's versions of "Heartache: 
"Straighten My Life" and "Make it 
Easy on Yourself" are particularly 
excellent. 

If you like roots reggae, you'll 
like this album. The variety among 
the 13 tracks provides something 
for every listener, and Brown has 
never sounded better on anyone 
of them. You'll also be contribut-
ing to a good cause, since as Flab-
ba Holt states in the liner notes, 
"This album, all royalty go to 
Dennis Emmanuel Brown family, 
100 percent. For me - I made 
Dennis Brown album. Dennis 
would say, 'May Your Food Basket 
Never Empty.' Bassa Flabba Holt 
say, 'Dennis, as long as I live, your 
family food basket shall never 
empty.'"

Tritons lose a See-Saw 
Match to Point Lorna 
Crosstown rival PLNU put up a good fight and 
pulls out a match against UCSD, 3-2 
By seon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons fought tooth and nail 
against crosstown rival Point Loma 
Nazarene University, on ly to fall in a 
heartbreaking five sets. 

The match was a true test of men-
tal and physical toughness, and UCSD 
just did not have it Tuesday night as 
PLNU squeaked by the Tritons 3-2 in 
a match with standout performances 
from players on both sides o~ the net. 

UCSD looked solid out of the gate, 
taking the first game 15-4 before drop-
ping the second game 8-15. The team 
had a resurgence in the third, taking it 
15-12, but just could not close the door 
on the deciding game, losing the next 
two 12-15 and 9-15. 

However, the tough loss was not dis-
heartening to the Triton players, who 
felt confident in their play. The loss was 
in a nonconference match, as the 
Tritons just had to get it out of their 
system before the all-important 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association matches looming in the 

near future. 
Many Triton athletes turned in solid 

performances in the loss, including 
Denelle Smally, Jennie Wilson and 
Laura Santerre. Smally logged 14 digs, 
Wilson had 10 kills and Santerre accu-
mulated 11 digs. 

Other contributors for the blue and 
gold were Diana Camarillo with 10 
kills and 11 digs, and Shannon Hawes 
and Kathleen Hents who had eight 
kills apiece. 

Jamie Robinson led Point Loma 
with a match-high 23 kills, while 
Carolina Sbodio backed her up with 21 
kills. 

With the loss, the Tritons' record 
falls to 13-4, while Point Lorna rises to 
17-3. 

The Tritons aim to improve on 
their record this weekend when they 
face-off in important CCAA 
match ups: 

The Tritons will be hosting 
California State University San 
Bernardino Friday at 7 p.m., and Cal 
Poly Pomona on Saturday, also at 7 
p.m.

Two swimmers had heart

ContI.ed frOM ..... 2' 
through the water has netted him 
a spot on the "Today Show" and 
interviews from press corps all 
over the world . A pair of his gog-
gles was sold on eBay for $2,500, 
and other swimmers at the games 
congratulated him many times 
over. 

There is no denying that The 
Eel's story, along with Bolopa's, 
has appeal. The two trained in the 
rivers of their native country, but 
until six m9nths ago had not 
swam at all, let alone in a 50-meter 
Olympic pool. 

"It was the first time I have 
swum 50 meters," said Balopa after 
her 50. "It was farther than I 
thought ." 

I t is a feel-good story. 
Should these athletes be 

embraced for their failure? Should 
they be celebrated because they 
tried hard and gave it their best 
shot? 

If they get these 15 minutes of 
fame, should not every athlete who 
competed, tried hard and went 
through some kind of tribulation 
to get to the games also get their 15 
minutes? 

The reason the Equatorial 
Guineans were allowed to com-
pete in the first place was that La 
Federation Internationale de 
Natation Amateur, the games' 
governing body, wanted to pro-
mote swimming in third-world 
countries - not because the com-
petitors were on par with others at 
the games, but because they 
served as a tool for FINA to 
exploit. 

For a real feel-good story, look 
to Keri Strug sticking her last vault 
on a sprained ankle, or the United 
States winning the gold medal in 
gymnastics. 

Don't look to two swimmers 
who swim as if they are afraid of 
the water. Their swims appeared as 
if some grotesque mistake had 
occurred and two people were 
crashing the Olympics, jumping in 
the pool to steal their time in the 
spotlight as streakers of the 
Olympic variety. 

The crowd and other athletes 
rallied around the two swimmers; it 
was the right thing to do. What 
could they have done instead? 
Made fun of the pair's perfor-
mance, chiding them for not swim-
ming as fast as the others? 

The fact remains that if it was 
not for an exception granted by 
FlNA, these athletes would not 

'iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. have been competing at the games, I and it was an exception granted not 
for performance, but only to pro-
mote swimming.

the games are not the place for 
this. The Olympics are about see-
ing the best of the best compete 
against each other. For every thou -
sand hours the likes of an Ian 
Thorpe or a Michael Johnson puts 
in, Bolopa and Moussarnbani put 
in maybe one. If Bolopa was 
allowed to compete, why shouldn't 
any athlete be given the chance to 
be in the games? 

The motto of the Olympics is 
"swifter, stronger, higher." Did 
these two athletes fulfill this 
creed? Is the fact that they swam 
their events and went as fast and 
as high and strong as they could 
enough to say they had the right 
to be there? ' 

No. it is not. The games are 
about the pure sport; they are 
about the best athletes in the 
world pushing themselves to the 
extreme. They are not about being 
there because it is possible to 
nominate two people' who never 
swam before for the sake of a 
country and FINA's wish for a 
swim team . 

. Yeah, Moussambani and Bolopa 
tned hard, but for the Olympics, 
that is not enough . Let them be 
there and let them compete. but let 
them be competitive.

Women's Soccer on 
a Roll on Roadtrip 
Behind Alfredson, Cuder and Poma, UCSD 
looks strong in sweep of Davis and Chico 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Home may be where the heart 
is, but the road can also be a very 
friendly place. 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team just returned from its second 
road trip of the year. Its last one was 
decent, splitting a pair of games 
against California State University 
L,!s Angeles and CSU Dominguez 
Hills. Last weekend's trip was even 
more successful. 
. On their most recent journey, 
the TIitons downed UC Davis on 
Friday 1-0 and beat Chico State 2-
o on Sunday. 

Both wins are huge for UCSD 
in regard to their California 
.C~lIegiate Athletic Association 
·rankings. The Tritons now stand 
at 7-2 overall and 6-2 in CCAA 
play. 
. Triton star Erika Alfredson is 

continuing her dream season and 
came through in the 69th minute 
against Davis for the lone, game-
winning goal. 

Alfredson outhustled Aggie 
goalkeeper Kelly Parker in pursuit 
of the ball right in front of the 
home team's net. The goal took 

everything out of Davis, and the 
Tritons held on for the game. 

UCSD dominated around the 
nets, outshooting its opponents 
16-9. During the middle of the 
game, Davis looked in control, 
keeping the ball in Triton territo-
ry. However, UCSD's defense held 
strong and kept Davis contained. 

Parker had a good game with 
nine saves. Triton goalkeeper Kami 
Poma played her part with three 
saves. 

The second game was even bet-
ter for UCSD against Chico State. 

Alfredson was al it again, scor-
ing yet another goal. She now leads 
the team in goals and points with 
seven and 18, respectively. Julia 
Cuder also showed her mettle by 
scoring a goal and dishing the 
assist to Alfredson. Poma kept the 
net area clean of all outside mater-
ial with her second shutout in a 
row. 

The Tritons are now going to 
be spending some time at home. 
On Friday night, UCSD plays 
host to CSU Bakersfield at 5 p.m. 
at RIMAC Field. On Sunday, CSU 
Stanislaus comes to town for a 
game at noon, also at RIMAC 
Field.

Also this weekend, UCSD's pla-

have come to an end. 

"Glenn Busch will be our starter 
from now on, but Lance Onken 
will be ready to jump in and back 
up Busch at a moment's notice," 
Harper said. "This weekend was a 
chance for the team to bond and 
just relax a little." 

UCSD's record now stands at 
13-3 and represents Triton water 
polo's best start since 1992 . 
However, the victory against 
Washington does not count as a 
tally in the win column, as it is

Not All 
Deserved An 
Olympic Trip 

TAIT MILLER 

T he Olympics are the pinna-cle of sports, and for many athletes competing in the 
games, it is the holiest of holy 
places. 

The athletes' thousands of 
hours in the pool or on the track 
are all for the chance to compete 
on sports' grandest of stages, the 
Olympic Games. 

Yet this year, two people put in 
only six months of work and com-
peted in the games. They were 
swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, 
Paula Barila Bolopa and Eric "The 
Eel" Moussambani. 

The Eel fi nished his 100-meter 
swim in just under two minutes, 
over one minute slower than the 
fastest male qualifier, and Bolopa 
finished her 50-meter swim in just 
over one minute, nearly three times 
as slow as the fastest qualifier in 
her heat. . 

As one reporter for Reuters put 
it, for "their glorious failure: 
each one of these athletes was 
granted immediate fame.

Cross Country 
DOes Well at 
Meet 
The women come in 
fourth and the men 
finish fifth at meet 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Contributing Sports Writer 

Last Saturday the cross country 
team put out strong performances 
in the Bronco Invitational hosted 
by Cal Poly Pomona at Prado Park 
in Chino, Calif. 

"The competition was excep-
tionally good: cross country Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale said. "We're 
enthusiastic about the results." 

The Tritons displayed precision 
team running in earning a fourth-
place finish for the women while 
the men came in fifth . 

Hillsdale won the men's divi-
sion, and Central Washington 
placed first on the women's side. 

For the first time this year, the 
men and women ran 10,000 meters 
and 6,000 meters, respectively. The 
previous racing distances were 
8,000 meters and 5,000 meters for 
men and women, respectively. 

"Both groups really pushed 
themselves," Arsdale said. 
"Especially with the elongated dis-
tance." 

The men's team was led by 
sophomore David Dunbar, who 
ran a 33:42.3 in the 10,OOO-meter 
run to place ninth. 

Dunbar was named Ttiton of 
thl: Week for his inspiring perfor-
mance, with freshman Chris Judge

PORTS 
UCSD Sweeps Tournament 
Tritons breeze through Slugfest, winning all six of its matchups 
By TAIl MILLER 
Staff Writer 

Perhaps taking its cue from the 
sports gods of days gone by, this 
weekend the UCSD men's water 
polo team played and ruled the 
pool like kings of yore, going 6-0 
in a three-day tournament at UC 
Santa Cruz. 

During the annual Slugfest, 
which was held from Sept. 29 to 
Oct. I , the Tritons outscored their 
six opponents by a combined score 
of 81-23, a nearly four-to-one ratio 
of Triton goals to goals allowed. 

Head Coach Denny Harper 
took 14 players on the trip ·and 
was able to play every one of them 
about equally over the three days. 

In the tournament, UCSD 
allowed four or less goals four 
times and managed to shut out 
Chapman University of Orange. 

Bei ng ranked sixth in the 
nation, however, nothing less was 
expected of the Tritons. 

"We should have won every 
game at that tourney, and did; 
Harper said. 

From the very first game, the 
Tritons were clicking as they 
demolished Cal Baptist University 
17-7. Things did ]lOt slow down 
from there, as in a game later that . 
day UCSD took down Santa Clara 
University 14-2. 

On the next day the University 
of Washington and Chapman pre-
sented no problems as the Tritons 
took the Huskies down 18-6 and 
scored.l1 points to Chapman's O. 

The final day of competition 
brought more of the same as 
UCSD dispatched archrival UC 
Davis 10-4, and then the host team 
UC Santa Cruz 12-4. According to 
Harper, the UCSC game was not as 
simple as it appeared. 

DaYid Pilz/ Guardian 
beaM -= UCSD's Vladimir Djapic, wlw has srored 28 goals in 92 quarters so far this season, tries to maneuver around an 
opponent during a match earlier this year. 

MIt is never easy to beat a team 
at home, especially at their own 
tournament. Despite what some 
people might call some 'home-
cooked' calls, we still dispatched of 
them without much trouble." 

The tourney consisted of 36 
games played in three days, with 
each team playing two games a day 
and six games in all. 

One of the low points of the 
tournament came during the first 
20 seconds, when Ttiton starting 
hole defender Brett Allen was 
knocked out of the game and the 
tourney by a viscous elbow, 

requiring eight stitches. 
There should be no worries for 

the Triton faithful, however, as 
Allen will be in the pool against 

Pepperdine this Saturday at 1 p.m.

Men's Soccer Ties With Davis, Crushes Chico 
Tritons head to Northern California, tie Davis and beat Chico to improve record to 7-2-1 
By ARYIND YUAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
improved it's overall and league 
records to 7-2-1 and 5-2-1, 
respectively, after playing againsr 
UC Davis and Chico State. 

In the UC Davis match. the 
Tritons seemed to be doing every-
thing right on defense but could 
not catch a break offensively. 
Freshman Jeremy Cookson had 
five saves to keep UCSD in the 
game, but after two overtimes the 
team could only muster a tie at 
Aggie Field. 

UC Davis was in control of the 
match, outshooting UCSD 19 to 
10, and a combined eight to three 
in the two overtime periods. 

However, the UCSD defense 
held its own, allowing the team 10 
escape with a 0-0 tie. 

UCSD also had its chances. 
Brady Bernard's shot in front of 

the goal was deflected by Davis' 
freshman goalkeeper Nic Platter. 
Platter ended up with four saves in 
the game. 

"The Davis game was tough; 
said Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong. MWe are finding out 
that every game in the conference 
can go either way. One day we can 
play well and lose, and another we 
can play bad and still win. We are 
still on an educational basis since 
we are so young, seeing the ele-
ments it takes to win." 

The Tritons rebounded from 
their tough game at Davis to beat 
Chico 3-1 on it's home turf. 

Junior Bobby Saadati once 
again had a nice game with two 
goals and one assist on freshman 
Chris Olson's goal: 

"We learned a lot from the UC 
Davis game: Armstrong said. "In 
the previous one, we knew that 
any game could go either way and 
that luck was a part of it. In this 

game, we just played freely and 
didn't concentrate on how the 
other team was playing: 

The team also realized, learn-
ing from the results of the last few 
conference games, that staying 
close in a tight match is extremely 
important. 

MThe main focus for this young 
team is to just hang in there; 
Armstrong said. "All I, as a coach, 
want to see is no loss of momen-
tum or low confidence and poise. 
If we can hang in tough games 
against skillful opponents, we give 
ourselves confidence going into 
the last minutes of matches where 
we can steal one." 

In making substitutions for the 
players, Armstrong said he looks 
for their poise and fatigue. .' 

"If I see signs of digression, I 
will make the necessary substitu-
tions that need to be made: he 
said. 

Looking ahead, the Ttiton soc-

cer team has a break until Oct. 6 
before playing at home against a 
tough California State University 
Bakersfield at 7 p.m. Following 
that, CSU Stanislaus will come to 
town Oct. 8 at 2 p.m. 

MBakersfield will be tough in 
my mind; Armstrong said. "They 
are the second-best team in the 
division below CSU Dominguez 
Hills - a team we lost to already 
this season. We must again hang 
in there and play consistently and 
not give up big plays." 

After the CSU Stanislaus 
game, the Tritons only have four 
more league matches to stamp its 
name on the postseason, so these 
next few games will be extremely 
crucial for the Tritons' postsea-
son hopes. These matches will 
include a trip to Phoenix to face a 
tough Grand Canyon University 
team and a journey North to 
Pomona to play Cal Poly 
Pomona.
