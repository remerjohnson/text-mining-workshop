Fee Referendum Fails 
Record 33 percent of students vote in special election, defeat fee increase by 3-2 margin 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

Despite receiving ihe highest 
voter turnout in UCSD's history, 
the Campus Life Fee Referendum 
failed to pass by over 750 votes, 
thereby eliminating the possibility 
of an annual student fee increase 
of about $210. 

Friday afternoon, the A.S. 
Election Committee released the 
results showing that 2,739 stu-
dents voted in favor of the fee 
increase, and 3,492 voted against 
it. 

Of the school's 18,600 stu-
dents, 6,231 undergraduate, grad-
uate and medical students voted 

last week contributing to a record 
33 percent voter turnout. 

"There were too many issues 
being tacked onto it," said A.S. 
Services and Enterprises 
Commissioner-elect Colin Parent. 
"It ended up making the whole 
thing controversial." 

The A.S. Council sponsored 12 
voting booths across campus from 
April 23 through April 28 in an 
attempt to raise voter turnout to 
over 20 percent, which is the min-
imum percentage that would have 
enabled the fee referendum to 
pass. 

Assistant Elections Manager 
Cristina Villegas said that a num-
ber of factors led to the record-

Spitting Pretty 

breaking turnout. . 
"It affected so many aspects of 

campus life so people wanted to 
vote," she said. "The polling places 
across campus certainly helped as 
well. People were definitely voting 
with their wallets." 

Villegas said that while si tting 
at the polls she noticed most of the 
votes were in favor of the fee on 
Monday and Tuesday, but that t~e 
numbers drastically changed by 
the week's end. 

"People who planned not to 
vote realized we had the lUrnou t 
we needed so they went and voted 
themselves," she said. "After every-
thing that went down on Friday, 1

Petition Filed Against Elections Manager 
Vasquez faces controversy over inclusion of slate names on ballot 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Judicial Board con-
vened to hear a petition filed 
against A.S. Elections Manager 
Vince Vasquez on April 23. The 
petition was filed by Matthew 
Bechtel, who ran for A.S. commis-
sioner of programming in the 
recent A.S. elections. 

Bechtel officially withdrew his 
complaint at the hearing after 
Vasquez failed to appear. 

"I was never info med of [the 
hearing!," Vasquez said. "No one 
ever contacted me. 1 actually was 
waiting every day for news about 
this, when we were going to have a 
hearing. No one ever ~alled me, 

Anna never told me, 1 never got an 
e-mail." 

The petition alleged that 
Vasquez failed to treat all candi-
dates equally in the election. 

"This complaint is brought 
fOlth against Vince Vasquez for 
unfair and biased actions toward 
candidates not running within a 
slate," Bechtel stated in his peti-
tion. 

Vasquez expressed that he did-
n't feel that he personally should 
have been called to judicial board. 

"Matt's issues aren 't really with 
me, they're with just the general 
A.S. elections and how they're 
run," Vasquez said. 

Before the election, Vasquez 
changed elections policy to omit 

slate names from the ballot. He 
later decided that slate names 
would be included. Bechtel's com-
plaint was that he decided not to 
participate in a slate based on 
Vasquez's original decision to omit 
slate names from the ballot. 

Vasquez legally changed the 
elections policy to exclude slate 
names from the ballot before can-
didate filing began. 

"After 1 took everything into 
consideration, 1 thought it was in 
the best interest of the A.S. elec-
tions that that be changed," 
Vasquez said. "I made this decision 
in complete accordance with the 
election bylaws."

on the Price Center's grassy nrea as 
a hate inciden t. 

The di sappea rance of the 
defaced crosses display occurred on 
Admit Day and has also been under 
investigation. 

UCSD police Detective Nate 
Floyd sa id that the crosses from the 
display were found and that they 
had not been stolen. 

"The crosses display was 
removed by the grounds crew in

"It wasn 't a theft. " 

Floyd also said that the ident ifi-

University Centers Director

tion of more fast food chains, they do 
not want to make this university even 
less affordable for those who aln::ady 
can barely pay for it and they do not 
approve of the administration's disre-
gard for the democratic process at any 
stage of the referendum's develop-
men!." 

To make the election fair for both 
parties, the administration funded 
lobby groups for and against the refer-
endum , 

However, Vill egas said that those 
against the fec referendum were able 
to present their views to the student 
body in a better fash ion than their 

pposition. 
"The 'no' campaign was very wcll -

mobilized and the 'yes' side wasn 't as 
well-organized: she said, "There were 
also a lot of messages being spread by 
the 'no' side and things really got 
t:mbellished by people," 

Villegas said one such rumor was 
th at the administration would not 
increase financial aid accordingly so 
that the students would have to pay 
for the increase on their own, A.S, 
Presidcnt Doc Khaleghi said this, in 
fact, was fa lse. 

"It is certified in writing from the 
office of financial aid that this fee 
would be covered by financial aid for 
those who qualify for it," he said in a 
campuswide e-mail. 

In addi tion, many students wanted 
a line-item vote for the elec tion, as they 
felt they would be able to vote for spe-
cific things they wanted as opposed to 
turning down the entire referendum, 

" It is a shame that it had to be done 
that way," said Marshall senior Scott 
Dalva, "I really wanted th e Price 
Centt:r expansion, but I really didn't 
want the sports to get tha t kind of 
money. I wasn't about to vo te 'yes: 
considering I was completely against a 
lot of it " 

Villegas said Iha l al!ho ugh rhe 
election committee thought about 
maktng this a line-item vote, they 
decided otherwise thinking that this 
way was the most likely way the fee 
referendum would get passed, 

.. People just have their own inter-
ests," she said. "We were just afraid 
that the competing referendum would 
collectively fail." 

Regardless, the student body's 
rejection of the referendum will affect 
other aspects of student life, which 
were previously unharmed, 

Villegas said that after the election 
rc~ults had been posted, Watson said 
that he was planning on ·cutting all 
departments under student affairs 
such as the collt:ge councils, Student 
Health and Psychologica l Services by 
10 percent to allow for spending on 
items he feels are important. 

"Everything under Student Affairs 
would be cut because the priority wi th 
Watson is with expanding Price 
Center," Villegas said. "State funds 
can 't be used for the expansion 
because it is a nonacademic building: 

In addi tion, the school made a 
commitment three years ago to fund 
moving to Division II athletics and 
must abide by that promise, Without 
the fee referendum, the money for this 
needs to come from other places such 
as Student Affairs. 

Cooper is opposed to this decision 
by the administrat iOn. 

" In order to find funding for cam-
pus improvement projects, it is the 
administration's responsibility and 
clear ability to tap into the university'S 
enormous discretionary funds, solicit 
outside donations, seek funding at the 
state level and search for money 
sources other than students' pockets," 
Cooper sa id. 

The recent vote shows that a 
majority of the student body does not 
agree with the expansion as well, ci ting 
that the students have failed to pass a 
referendum two years in a row that 
would expand the Price Center, 

For now, the opinion of the stu-
dents has been heard. 

"This vote carries with it a message 
from the students: If you want to use 
our money, we are going to say exact-
ly how it will be used: Cooper said ,

Jennifer Myer I Guardian 

Learning a foreign language promotes culture and allows 
students to enjoy art and literature in its truest form 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a sense, I can understand why some 
people might turn against a requirement for 
foreign languages in college. In an age dom-
inated by technology, and by the pidgin 
English language that comes with it, why 
should we, one might ask, waste our time 
learning Spanish or Russian? Wouldn 't that 
time be more sensibly used learning yet 
another computer language or some Inter-
net ski lls? 

This opinion (which, believe me, is far 
fro m hypothetical) reveals some serious 
misconceptions about the role of education 
and its place in today's society. 

An example of these misconceptions is 
the confusion between education and job 
training, and the reduction of the former to 
the latter. To assume that one's goal in col-
lege is only to learn the 
ski lls necessary to find a 
well-paying job is a com-
mon, but hopelessly nar-
row statement. 

Ed ucation is, or 
should be, a way of cre-
ati ng curious, open-
minded, critical people 
with a decent amount of 
cultural awareness and 
the capacity to acquire more. This distinc-
tion is more important than it might look 
at fi rst. 

This country ostensibly professes free-
do m, but freedom entails choice, and 
choice entai ls the capacity to critica lly ana-
lyze the cultural and economic messages 
that society sends us, lest freedom be 
reduced to an empty shell in which we only 
choose what we are brainwashed to choose. 
To the extent that cul ture is necessary for 
freedom. so is education in a sense that 
transcends Job trainll1g. 

Thl consideration bri ngs my some-
what lengthy preamble to the point of the 
study of foreign languages. For it is true 
that Job training, especially in technica l 
fields, would not require the knowledge of 
any foreign language (it doesn't even 

require a real knowledge of the English 
language), but it is also true that our cul-
tural environment is sending us increas-
ingly multicultural and fragmented signals 
that (an only be analyzed using sophisti-
cated cultural instruments, many of which 
are multilingual. 

To the exten( that college education 
should be primarily cultural, it is fitting that 
society acknowledges the changed cultural 
landscape and imposes some language 
requirements as part of the normal educa-
tional process. 

There will certainly be a legitimate desire 
to know why, of all the forms that multicul-
turalism is taking, universities should privi-
lege the linguistic. After all, 20th century 
media have-been primarily visual, and even 
now the race toward anything multimedia is 
favoring visual (and, maybe, in a near ' 
future, haptic) modes of expression. We can 

expect that the intercul-
turll l influence will often 
take the form of visual 
artS, like paintings, cine-
ma, or video; can't we be 
just as well-immersed in 
the multicultural flow 
without having to learn 
any languages? . 

I will surmise that lan-
guage is not just another 

medium through which a certain type of 
content is delivered: Language is the social 
construction par excell r nce, and it is the 
matrix in wh ich cultural artifacts, even visu-
al ones, are created. 

It is not just that without Spanish one 
wi ll be unable to fully enjoy a Garcia Mar-
quez novel; it is that without Spanish and 
tbe knowledge of Hispanic culture that 
comes wi th it, one will only be able to have 
a part ial understanding even of the visual 
work of Diego Rivera. It is not just that 
'without French one will be unable to 
appreciate a Chabrol film ; it is also that 
wi thout knowing a little French , one will 
fi nd it hard to understand the environment 
in which surrealism flourished.

Foreign language requirements hinder students' abilities to 
enjoy college and will help little in their future careers 
By CLAIRE VANNETTE 
Staff Writer 

It's a fact of life here at UCSD and count-
less other universities: Every year, college stu-
dents are forced to take courses they do not . 
want to in order to complete general educa-
tion requirements. For the literature major, it 
may be a dreaded quarter of calculus; for the 
engineer, a course in obscure history. 

Grumbling about GEs is usually 
answered by administrators and professors 
with a common sense: "It's good for you: 
like the nasty-tasting cough syrup Mom 
used to force down our throats. This is true 
for many GE requirements; there is certain-
ly much to be gained from understanding 
history and society, and possessing basic sci-
ence and quantitative skills. However, those 
who lump foreign language into the scope of 
indispensable talents are mistaken. . 

The learning of foreign 

and "yo quiero Taco Bell." For every future 
academic who must .consult journals in Ger-
man, there are scores of aspiring computer 
programmers wno need C++, not Catalan. 

Second, universities with this require-
ment assume that graduates will retain 
whatever language skills they are forced to 
learn. This is not the case. Three quarters of 
Italian in a student's freshman year will be a 
distant, fadi ng memory by the time he 
begins his career. 

Another argument used to advance the 
case for foreign language requirements is that 
knowledge of another language provides 
knowledge of another culture. The benefits of 
this are undeniable, as understanding other 
cultures allows for comparison with and bet-
ter evaluation of one's own society. 

However, spending hours a day in lan-
guage labs, discussing how Marie went to 
I'hopital for her fievre, gives no insight into 

the particularities of 
life in France. If col-languages at a university is as 

old as higher education itself. 
In the Renaissance, scholars . 
had to read Latin fluently in 
order to have access to the 
grea.test literary works and 
histories available. Certainly, 
learning to speak French or 
Spanish or American Sign 
Language has its relevance 

con 
leges are interested in 
providing their stu-
dents with a grasp on 
international affairs, 
they should require 
courses in ~oreign 
history, not In the 
language. 

6UARfJlAN OPINION 

and importance for many. However, it is 
simply ridiculous to expect it of every single 
student who enters the hallowed halls of a 
university. 

Proponents of foreign language as a cru-
cial element of general education often cite 
the growing globalization of all fields of 
business, public and private. They claim that 
because bilingualism is an advantage in the 
job market, college students should be 
forced to either demonstrate fluency in a 
language other than English, or devote sev-
eral quarters to its study. 

There are two problems here. The fi rst is 
that while bilingualism is helpful in many 
occupations, especially in California where 
Spanish is as much a lingua franca as English, 
there are plenty of jobs for which someone 
never needs know more than "bon appetft" 

Of course, this 
requirement annoys students, and any annoy-
ance that clearly is not neceSSary ought to be 
removed. This provides for the improved 
health and happiness of students, which is a 
university'S top priority - A fact that could 
stand to be reiterated to some here-unnamed 
administrators at some here-unnamed uni-
versities. There is a more pressing detriinental 
effect on students, however, than complaints 
over the subjunctive tense and the masculine 
article. 

If people are not happy in a class, they 
are not goi ng to exert very much effort 
toward it, or "ring very much passion to 
discussion. We have all suffered through 
classes we hated, snoozing or sneering our 
way to a Pass grade. What is an inconve-

A Few Paragraphs on 
Some Random Topics 

Stop 
That! 

BERTRAND FAN 
've decided that my atten-
tion span is so short that I 
ca n't actually write approxi-

mately 800 words on anyone topic. 
So, instead of writiRg on semi-relat-
ed topics and badly joining them 
together with opening and closing 
transition sentences, I've decided to 
,:"rite about two random topics, 
dedicating a paragraph to each. Or 
rather, several paragraphs each, 
after my editors are done with it . Or 
maybe they'll be done with that last 
sentence and this one as well. 

You see, the problem with writ-
ing one big paragraph, which I like 
to do, is that it looks like crap. And 
then you have to take into consider-
atioo tpat it's a column. The very 
definition of a column is something 

_ that's not very wide and rather skin-
ny. And skinny text looks even 
longer when you print it in newspa-
pers, because they print your words 
in columns. No one likes to read 
long strings of crap, but I suppose 
you do if you've gotten this far. But 
as I was saying, I'm writing on two 
topics. They are alarm clocks and 
Black Mountain Road, and they 
have nothing to do with each other. 

I hate alarm clocks. I have two in 
my room, and one on my cell phone. 
An interesting fact is that neither of 
the alarm clocks in my room are 
mine. They both belong to my girl-
friend, and I'm holding on to all of 

her crap while she's in Spain. My 
room is like Public Storage, but with 
lower monthly payments. 

The one on my desk is what I 
fondly refer to as "the loud piece of 
crap." It has a nice, big, red LED 
and it's louder than any alarm clock 
I've ever heard in my li fe. It sounds 
like a smoke detector. 

And the other alarm clock, the 
one on my bedside table, is a Power-
puff Girls alarm clock. Let me stress 
again that this is my girlfriend's 
alarm clock. I think the fact that it is 
my girlfriend's alarm clock counters 
the blatant homosexual implications 
of having it on my bedside table. 

Regardless, on regular nights, I 
set the loud piece of crap for around 
noon. I have class 1 :25-ish, but I 
take long showers, which might 
imply that I masturbate in the show-
er, but I find that rather cold and 
uncomfortable. I find that places to 
masturbate are a lot like places to 
have sex - beds seem to be the best. 

On irregular nights - let's say I 
have a lab at 9 a.m. - I' ll set the 
Powerpuff Girls clock for 7:30 a.m., 
the loud piece of crap for 7:45 a.m., 
and my cell phone for 8:40 a. m. 
This is what happens the next day: 
A quiet buzzing will emit from the 
Powerpuff Girls clock, I'll wake up, 
laugh at the ridiculous thought of 
waking up at such an absurd hour, 
and turn it off. Then, around 7:45 
a.m., a loud, piercing sound will go 
off, my eyes will shoot open, and I'll 
get out of bed, walk over to it and 
hit snooze. 7:55 a.m. : Repeat, 
adding profanity. 8:05 a.m.: Similar, 
coincidentally, to 7:55 a.m. , but

AtTest of Milosevic Not the End 
The 'Butcher of Balkans' was recently captured, but the 
ethn ic tensions are sti ll close to boi ling over 
By MARY ONEUA ESTUDILLO 
Staff Writer 

Since the two world wars last 
century, the Balkans have main-
tained a reputation as the "pow-
dec keg of Europe," a reputation 

t ~at is perpetuated into the 21 st 
century. 

Although it seems like th ings 
are fin ally beginn ing to simmer 
down with the arrest of Siobodan 
Milosevic and his cronies, it is 
the stan of much more contro-
versy. 

Last October, there rang a cer-
tain hope in the air fo r those in 
Serbia. The supposedly unsink-
able Milosevic had been arr,ested. 

ever in the last 50 years have 
people compared anyone to 
Adolf Hitler as much as they do 
Milosevic. Although the man, 
whom many be lieve single-hand-
edly destroyed Serbia, Croatia 
and Bosnia, has been arrested, it 
is currently uncertain whether he 
will actually be charged for his 
crimes aga inst humanity. 

Reconstruction has already 
started. Last year on April 26, 
Yugoslav president Vojislav Kos-
tunica announced that initiatives 
were already being launched to 
fost er understand ing between 
Serbian and Montenegrin 
authorities. Election plans are 
already underway. 

Serbia, however, is still far 
from peace and healing. The 
future holds a tedious recon-
structive process that most 
observers believe will be a great 
task for not only Serbia, but for 
all of the Bal kan states and 
Europe. Tribal and political con-

Many questions will be 
raised, and the 
extraction of Milosevic 
will not really provide a 
solution to the Balkans' 
problems. 
fli cts are still potential hin -
drances, and although the Balka-
ns are more democratic now 
than they have ever been, it will 
take more than just the depar-
ture of Milosevic to erase the 
effects of the Communist dicta-
torship that they have all known. 

Today, armed Albanians in 
southern Kosovo still take refuge 
in NATO's buffer zone while 
killing Serb policemen. On the 
other side, in Macedonia, there is 
still fighting over the multi-eth-
nic state. Killings have not slowed 
quite yet, as eight soldiers were 
shot in Macedonia two Saturdays 
ago. These killings are considered 
the highest death toll in a si ngle 
attack since last February. 

The never-unified BLlsniiln 
roa ts and Serbs do haw aile 

thing in commo n: the Ameri-
ca n-engineered fcdn,llll'n . 
The United Statl's is ,lITilnglllg 
to make agreements II'llh 
Yugos lav ia alld the Ulllll'd 
Nations to rmn v thl' il'asl' on 
the 9,OOO-acrc Alll lTicall b,lse 
in Kosovo fo r 75 years more. 
Many crit ic ize the Unitl'd 
States for their arbi tral), and 
brutal methods of peacl' keep-
ing. Some say thi s "forced pro-
tection" will soon breed VIO-
lence among the Balka n states. 
Then, of course, the queslion 

of statehood comes to play. Will 
the Yugoslav federation con tinue 
to exist as one ent ity? Montene-
gro and Serbia are like ly addi-
tions, as is Kosovo. Addi tionally. 
the Serbian Matia threatcns Ser-
bian officials who are hand ling 
Milosevic's charges. The fu ture of 
these states will . indeed, prove a 
larger ca tastrophe than Miloscvic 
himself if mauers are not hand kd 
correctly. 

Many ques ti ons will be 
raised, and th e extrac tion of 
Milosevic will not rea lly provide 
a sollilion to the Balkans' prob-
lems. While it is certain that his 
arrest has lifted some of the bur-
den , it has not lifted all of it. 

Tho~sands of supponers arc still 
demanding that Milosevic be 
released, and violence contin ues 
to plague the region as you read 
this art icle. 

While all we can do is si t and 
wai t fo r events to unfold, it is 
cenain that the people of the 
Balkans have ye t to come to a 
point of relief.

Pro: 
Foreign languages help 
culture students in life 
Continued from page 4 

The list could go on indefi-
nitely and, of course, one cannot 
learn all of the languages spoken 
in the world. Tough choices are 
necessary, but one has to start 
somewhere. 

To be an attentive, critical and 
aware actor in today's world, the 
horizon of one nation or one cul-
ture is too short. Universities 
would give students a disservice if 
they didn 't include the knowl-
edge of languages with basic 
requirements like knowing Eng-
lish and mathematics. 

In a few words: A multilingual 
culture has become a de facto 
requirement for any educated 
person, and it is time to include it 
as an essential requirement of 
any college career. 

The possibility of talking to 
people using their own language 
makes life in a multi-ethnic 
environment such as San Diego 
much more stimulating, and I 
must admit that my Spanish-
speaking friends were a large 
part of my initial impulse to 
study Spanish. This is not to 
mention the deliciously useless 
pleasure of knowing, for 
·i!1stance, that the French word 
for "man" is "homme," which 
comes from the Latin "humus; 
meaning "earth," signaling the 
earthly essence of man as 
opposed to the spiritual essence 
of the divinity. 

These factoids will not help 
me in my job and will not make 
any money for me, but I find 
them fascinating. 

The question, tf anything, is 
this: Why wait as late as college to 
impose a foreign language 
requirement at a time when most 

developed countries are intro-
ducing foreign languages as early 
as first grade? French, German 
and Dutch students leave high 
school with seven to 10 years of 
exposure to one or two foreign 
languages. Given the condition of 
American high schools, I doubt 
that such a solution would be 
feasible here. So, as a temporary 
solution, it makes sense to post-
pone the language requirement 
until college. 

Finally, if I can have the pre-
sumption to give some advice to 
UCSD administrators, I would 
suggest that they make the 
requirement particularly pressing 
for science and engineering 
majors. Whether we like it, engi-
neering activities have a great 
weight in this technology-domi-
nated society. At the same time, 
American engineers are singular-
ly absent from the cultural and 
political debate around technolo-
gy and the choices that it entails, 
due, at least in part, to the narrow 
education that they receive. 

I am not saying that learning 
a foreign language, per se, will 
provide engineers with the nec-
essary cultural preparation, but 
with languages comes the appre-
ciation of a different social 
structure, and that will help a 
lot. It is probably not a coinci-
dence that engineers and scien-
tists in the countries I have men-
tioned above are much more 
involved than their American 
counterparts in the cultural and 
political life of their respective 
countries, and that none of the 
corresponding languages has a 
word fo r "geek" or "nerd." 

We can have techno-geeks 
enamored with their gizmos and 
happy to spend the night in a lab, 
or critical, open-minded individ-
uals. Learning a language will not 
bring us from one to the other, 
but it will at least be a step in the 
right direction.

nience to us is a disaster for those 
who want something more than a 
checkmark on a list of require-
ments. 

Those students whose passion 
drives them to explore intricacies of 
etymology and syntax suffer 
immeasurably from being forced 
into classes filled wi th people more 
interested in note-passing than 
note-taking. Perhaps cowed into 
believing their input is unwelcome 
by their peers (and probably being 
right), they are denied the opportu-
nity to engage in meaningful dis-
cussion . They may refrain from 
asking in-depth questions. Their 
pursuit of knowledge - the pur-
ported reason for higher educatior. 
at all - is stunted by the presence 
of well-meaning but dissatisfied 
students only in it to get it over 
with. 

The ability to speak a foreign 
language is, for some, a useful skill. 
It can also be a rewarding and 
interesting field of study, and 
makes for a great elective. However, 
what it cannot do is promise a bet-
ter job after graduation, necessarily 
enrich a student's understanding of 
other cultures or stimulate every-
one who walks into the classroom. 

[f a department feels that for-
eign language study will bener the 
student experience (as is the case, 
for example, with the literature 
major, in which students are 
required to complete upper-divi-
sion course work in a secondary 
language), let them figure that into 
their requirements. Other stu-
dents should be allowed more 
freedom with their academic 
schedules. Foreign languages 
should be a joy or a useful tool, 
not a biller pill to swallow.

honest mistake: Ratcliff said. "And 
I also informed them that we 
revised our space reservations pro-
cedures so that our grounds crew is 
fully informed about exhibits on 
the green space," he said. 

Muir junior Jessica Lopez, chair

"After discussing this incident 
with the MEChA board, it is clear 
that we have not ruled out the pos-

sibility that our exhibit was taken 
down for Admit Day to eliminate 
anything 'controversial' from cam-

Ratcliff was adamant in his expla-

"The reservations department 
doesn't make judgments on con-

Ratcliff said. "It is an absolute myth 
that the removal of the crosses dis-

Admit Day or has any intent to

Petition: 
Vasquez allegedly didn't 
publicize ballot change 
Continued from page 3 
According to A.S. bylaws, the judi-
cial board has 16 academic days to 
hear such petitions. Outgoing A.S. 
President Doc Khaleghi appointed 
Warren student Cori Hall as chair 
of the judicial board. 

Thejudici,al board convened on 
the 16th day, April 23. Hall and 
representatives from Marshall , 
Muir, Roosevelt and Warren col-
leges were present at the hearing. 

Bechtel proposed three possible 
resolutions in his petition. One was 
to uphold the original decision to 
omit slate names from the ballot. 
Another was to reopen filing to 
allow all candidates to decide again 

ments on their poster that had 
been covered by either black paint 
or permanent black pen: "That's 
what they get," "Why commemo-
rate criminals?" and "These people 
are criminals." 

Lopez said that the comments 
were obviously referring to the sta-
tistics provided by MEChA on the 
poster memorializing the hundreds 
of immigrants who have died trying 
to cross the border into the United 

. States. 
Yet Lopez said the real issue is 

not illegal immigration, as implied 
by the person or persons who 
defaced the poster. 

"The real issue is that people 
are dying and that some people 
think these deaths are justified," 
Lopez said. 

Lopez said that in the aftermath 
of the hate incident and removal of 
their crosses display, the MEChA 
organization has · responded by 
putting its display back up in the 

whether to be on a slate and begin 
the campaign period over. The 
th ird was to allow independent 
candidates the space on !,he ballot 
allotted for slate names for their 
own advertising. 

According to Bechtel, Vasquez 
tentatively agreed to the third pro-
posed solution, then later informed 
Bechtel that it could not be done. 

"[Bechtel] was pretty irate and I 
just wanted to get through every-
thing he addressed," Vasquez said. 
"I told him I'll go with it, as long as 
it didn't arise controversy." 

Bechtel said that Vasquez told 
him he 'would allow use of the 
space unless he found that it violat-
ed election bylaws. 

"He has still not informed me of 
any violation this resolution might 
cause, yet he turned it down any-
way," Bechtel stated in his petition. 

Vasquez decided based on 

Price Center grass area, but with 
one significant change. 

Lopez said that MEChA added 
a separate poster board so that 
there would be a place for students 
to make comments. 

"We added a separate poster 
board so that students could 
respond: Lopez said. "We've got-
ten a lot of positive comments." 

However, Marshall junior 
Candace Katungi, who is not a 
member of MEChA, said she wit-
nessed a student write a negative 
comment on the response board. 

"The student wrote: 'Why are 
you making a memorial for crimi-
nals? If you want to prevent deaths, 
build higher walls,'" Katungi said. 

Katungi said she then engaged 
the student in a thoughtful and calm 
dialogue for the next 20 minutes. 

"I asked him what he meant by 
criminals," Katungi said. "He replied 
that the emphasis should be on the 
fact that when the immigrants i1le-

precedent that the space could not 
be used as a free speech space. 

"[TIle spacer had never been 
used as a free speech space," 
Vasquez said. "[Bechtel] wanted a 
second chance for his own person-
al campaign. I was looking at it in 
terms of that it wasn't in the best 
interest of the election. I was fol-
lowing precedent." 

Because Bechtel withdrew his 
petition, no judicial action was 
taken. 

"I think if Matt's claim had gone 
through, it had a chance of nullify-
ing the election," Villegas said. 

No other candidates filed peti-
tions regar'ding the issue. 

Vasquez has since submitted 
legislation to amend the election 
bylaws. 

"If candidates have information 

See PETITION, Page 9 

ga ily crossed, they knew the risks. 
"I told him that no death is justi-

fiable. I pointed ounhat we only use 
the death penalty for severe crimes. I 
then asked him if what the immi-
grants did was severe enough to 
warrant their deaths. He didn't say 
anything after that," Katungi said. 

Lopez said that the hateful and 
ignorant reactions by some stu-
dents to the or sanization's attempt 
to bring awar .ness to the campus 
through thr crosses display has 
made it c1e; that there is still a lot 
of ignora : that needs to be 
deconstruL .. j, 

"People at UCSD need to ana-
lyze and challenge notions that 
'immigrants are criminals: or that 
'immigrants deserve what they get,'" 
Lopez said. "These misconceptions 
about immigrants are made to seem 
natural to hide the fact that they are 
constructed strategically to justify 
the exploitation of these groups for 
the benefit of others."

------------------------

"I just hope that the Unity slate 
has the ability to he open-minded in 
the review of Mr. Vasquez's pending 
legislation:' Bechtel said. "He has a 
difficult task considering that all of 
next year's council ran on, and prob-
ably won as a result of, slate names 
being listed in the A.S. election bal-
lot." 

Vasquez said he will fight for his 
legislation . 

"If they don 't approve it, I'll push 
it," Vasquez said. "If they do want to 
keep slate names or they want to 
have free Speech space, I will imme-
diately file legislation to make it free 
speech space. It has to be formalized 
one way or the other." 

In a statement made at the hear-
ing, Bechtel said, "The continua-
tion of this judicial board hearing 
would be pointless, if not detri-
mental to the future of the A.S. 
election process. The damage has 
been done and this judicial board 
has no possible way of fixing it. In 
retrospect, Mr. Vasquez knows 
what he has done is wrong, and I 
feel his pending legislation is an 
attempt at making it right." 

Hall responded. 
"J-Board has decided not to issue 

an advisory opinion," Hall said. 
"Due to the withdrawal of the com-
plaint, the case is dismissed."

hen Muir junior Jacob Knapp 
arrived in Washington in January, 
he had mixed feelings about Ihe 
experiences that lay ahead , Knapp, 
a participant in the UCDC pro-
gram, was initially over.vhdllled , 

"I didn't know anyone cise 
who was in the program, so I was a little na-
vous going in ," Knapp said. "But by the Ilille it 
was over, our group had really bonded ," 

Knapp is one of 24 students from UCSD 
who participated in the program winter quar-
ter. The UCDC program was created nearly 10 
years ago, with the purpose of giving UC stu-
dents the opportunity to takc cou rses and have 
internships while living in the district area, 
UCSD has been sending students to partici-
pate in this program for the past fivc years, and 
the program has grown considerably since its 
creation , 

In the past, participants of the program have 
resided at the Virginian apartments in 
Arlington . Va., but beginning this fall, students 
will live in the new University of California 
Washington Center, located in the heart of the 
city, 

The new 11 -story building will house near-
ly 300 students each quarter, as well as several 
seminar rooms, conference rooms, an auditori-
um, a multi-purpose room, a computer lab and 
several classrooms, Additionally, the building 
will house the Office of Federal Governmental 
Relations and other adminis trative and 
research units of the University of Cali fornia. 
The center will serve as the epicenter of the 
UCDC program, maki ng it the largest non local 
university in Washington , 

Along with the opening of the new center, 
there have recently been some changes to the 
local program headquarters. After five years of 
being centered in rhe political science depart-
ment, the headquarters for the program has 
moved to the Career Services Center, Although 
the program wi ll continue to be operated by 
the political science department, the promo-
tion, recruitment, Web site, internship infor-
mation and advising and app lication proce-
dures will a ll be orchestrated by Career 
Services, 

Shan non Roberts, the UCDC internship 
coordinator, feels that the move will have a 
strong impact on the amount of publicity that 
the program receives at UCSD, 

"In the past, the program was not promoted 
as much," Roberts said. "But with the op('fling 
of the new center and the increase in thl' 
number of students we will be able to s~nd 
every quarter, we can already see the pro-
gram becoming increasingly popular al110ng 
UCSD students," 

For UCSD students, the complctilln l)f 
th is new facility willincre,lse thc.nlll11bcl l)f 
students partiCipating 111 the program L' ilL' h 
quarter. The location of Ihe bUilding IS abl) 

convenient for students because 1t IS 111 
such closc proximity to man)' governlll~Jltal 

organizations and agencIes. 
. For Knapp, a political scicn(l: m,lJor. the 
II1ternshlp was a valuable learning ~xperiencc . 

"The UCDC program opened up III)' cyl'S 
to the East Coast lifestyle and how our govcrn-
ment works," Knapp said. ''I've always bcen a 
California boy, but this trip madc me want to 
go to law school on th e East Coast." 

Applicants will assell1bk a file comlstlng 
of a cover sheet, applicatlOJl form, offiCIal

resume and letter of intent to enroll. 
Students should then turn th~sL'

1y first tnp on Amtrak came 
.11 thc c/1d of last summer, when I 
spcnt two mOlllhs In Chtcago. 
Bell1g d native of Chicago, I have 
tlown between Chicago and San 
Diego several times a year since I 
was 4- yea rs old . It was time to 
ditch flymg ,lI1d really see what lay 

between the two cities. 
I se t out on a Tuesday after-

noon , and almost immediately 
met a guy named J.R. I was somc-
what scared of him, as I later 
found Ollt he had done time in 
San Quentin. But when I told him 
I was going to Oceanside, Calif., 
he got excitt:d. 

He left Oceanside ycars ago to 
gct away from his drug problem, 
stoppcd in Oklahoma, where his 
truck ran out of gas, and has lived 
thert: evt:r Slllce, 

The drug problem explained 
hiS San Quentin tllne, but it was 
obVIOUS to me that the problem 
wasn 't t:ntirely bchllld Ium. He 
once gnmaced in pall1 whik sit-
tll1g down because he had a pipe 
in hts back pocket. Not a tobacco 
pipe. "Oops, YOll didn't set: that," 
he said to me as he moved it to hiS 
front pocket. I did see it, and later 
whm he came out of tht: smoking 
lounge with some other people, I 
could tell that they had put the 
pipe to usc. 

I was surprised that someone 
would do such a thing on a train, 
but there was little doubt as to 
what had happcl1l:d. They came 
out I'ery amused at the most mun-
dane things. Corn fields were 
entertaining to thcm . Train Itfe 
was beginning to entertain me. 

Often I am most Interested in 
talking to train person lH:1. 
Apparently I am not the only one, 
as they seem to have heard many 
of my questions a thousand times 
before. I now know where the 
crew sleeps, how well they sleep, 

how their shifts are scheduled, 
what th ei r favorite roLltes are and 
why, how fast the train travels, and 
even how often people commit 
suicide by lying 011 the rails. I 
found it a very interesting life, and 
so did many of them. I also found 
that not all Amtrak employees 
enjoy their jobs. 

This winter, I traveled to 
Seattle, riding coach on Amtrak's 
Coast Starlight. There were plenty 
of drunks on this two-day trip. 
Many started drinking in Los 
Angeks and didn't stop until 
Dolly the snack car attendant 
closed the bar compktdy, much 
to everyonc's dismay, 

Some guys called her a bitch, 
almost in front of her face, and 
while I thought they were rude, 
they weren't that far off: I tried to 
start a conversation with her by 
asking her how her day was and it 
didn't go well . She wasn't having a 
particularly bad day, it was almost 
like any other, she said. She hated 
her job. She sold snacks and 
drinks all day, and no, traveling 
wasn't an interesting aspect of her 
job. It got old after four months, 
and that was 17 years ago. 

She advised-me to pick a career 
I truly enjoy and told me her life 
was a sad story of someone who 
didn't do that. I felt sorry for her 
and after talking to her over a two-
day period I began to understand 
that she was having a rough time 
with the drunks on the trip. When 
she found out I was a writer, she

internship that relates to their 

UCS D political sci-
ence department 
and director of the 
UCDC program at 
UCSD, encourages 
students from all 
majors to apply for 
the program. 

"This is not just

the end of the 1 D-
weck program, stu-
dents are expected 
to produce an 
intcnsive research 
paper related to 
their internship 
experience, 

StudL"nts arc 
able to choose 
from several differ-

ing a rt history, 
sociology, politics, 
public policy, 
media and eco-
nomics to sattsfy 
their elective den ts from the 

humanities and sci-
ences applying to the UCDC pro-
gram." 

The quarter-long program pro-
vides students the chance to spend 
time away fro m UCSD, have an 
internship, as well as earn regular 
grades and units for coursework 
completed while in the district. The 
cost of the program is comparable 
to quarterly fees at UCSD, but the 
cost of living in Washington is 
slightly higher than in San Diego. 
Student housing is fully furnished, 
and the cost is approximately $725 
per month for rent.

Although the course require-

UCDC: 
Internships often have 
many perks 
Continued from page 12 
have to take advantage of them." 

Although UCDC students take 
courses while in Washington. the 
internship .is the main component 
of the program. According to the 
UCDC internship coordinators, 
there are a number of internship 
opportunities relating to agricul-
ture, science and environmental 
policy, arts, museums, arts adminis-
tration, Congress, economic policy, 
elections, political parties, action 
groups, human services & social 
policy, international affairs, law and 
justice, and press and the media. 

Revelle senior Marjorie Knott, a 
political science major, spem last 
spring interning at the White 
House in the Office of Presidential 
Inquiries for the Department of 
Correspondence. 

She served as a supervisor, and 
enjoyed the many opportunities 
she was ~iven while completing her 
internship. 

"I had a lot of perks as an 
intern," Knott said. "I went to State 
Arriv~ls: ushered speaking engage-
ments for diplomats and special 

hite House tours and helped 
coordinate Volunteer Appreciation 
Day and the Easter Egg Roll." 

The program was also a defin-
ing experience in Knott's career. 
Her internship experience substan-
tially changed her career goals. 

"Being a political science major, 
I always figured that law school was 
the next step for me," Knott said. 
"My internship in D.C. redirected 
my abilities and my passion, 
because working within the 
Correspondence Department 
helped me recognize that my 
favorite part of my political science 
studies was in the composition and 
presentation of material. I liked the 
public relations aspect of my 
degree, and as an intern for the 
ultimate medium of public rela-
tions for political affairs, let's just 
say I found my niche: 

For other students, such as 
Knapp, the internship experience 
reinforced prior career goals. 

"Down the road, I would like to 
become a federal judge, and by 
working at the District Court in 
D.C. , I was able to interview and 
observe several judges and see what 
their daily routines entailed: 
Knapp said. " I was able to observe 
cool trials including the Microsoft 
case, and my internship at the 
courthouse has intensified my 
desire to go to law school," he said.

all seemed very logical, as she was 
trained to pick up on little hints 
from people and work her psychic 
magic from there. [t was all very 
fascinating. 

The interesting people that I 
have met during my train and hos-
tel travels are almost too numerous 
to count: the owner of an Internet 
company in Amsterdam, a widow 
whose husband was a big-time edi-
tor for a Toronto newspaper, a stu-
dent from Hungary, a bartender 
from Scotland, and a man who, as a 
baby, was allegedly held by William 
Faulkner. 

Inevitably, the discussions 
would turn to cultural differences, I 
discussed music in the United 
States compared to music in 
Britain and the Netherlands. I 
explained several times to several 
people how our nation's electoral

For Knott, the UCDC program 
was a life-changing experience. 

"Words cannot describe the 
impact that this program had on my 
life," Knott said. "This experience 
shaped the person that I am, and 
shaped the goals that I know seek." 

The deadline for the fall quarter

don 't "sound like an American ." I 
wasn't sure how to take that, but 
assumed it was a personal compli-
ment from Canadians. 

These experiences have taught 
me the value of traveling alone and 
the value of altemate modes of 
travel. It seems that people who 
ride trains and sleep in hostels are 
of a different class than those who 
rush through airports and check 
into Hiltons. They are often work-
in3-class people, and I think that is 
what makes them interesting. They 
are not uppity or snobbish. I may 
travel by myself, but with this

UCSD 
Triathlon 
Team 
Travels 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD triathlon team com-
peted in the Southwest Regional 
Championships in Puerto Penasco, 
Mexico, earlier tryis month, kicking 
off the collegiate triathlon season 
that runs through September. 

UCSD placed sixth out of the 
10 schools participating. 

The event was Olympic dis-
tance, with a 1.5-kilometer swim, 
40-kilometer bike ride and a 10-
kilometer run. 

The race was on a relatively flat 
course, but weather was not toO 
friendly. High winds and heat visi-
bly took their toll on the athletes. 

The overall team scores were 
based on that school's combined 
times of its top three finishers. 

The men finished sixth with a 
combined time of 7:04:56. The top 
school overall was University of 
Colorado. 

The women also came in sixth, 
finishing with a combined time of 
9:09:17. UC Santa Barbara took 
the top mark in a time of 7:43:04. 

A squad also represented UCSD 
in Big Bear last weekend at the Bird 
Rock and Damn Sprint Races. 

At Bird Rock, UCSD's Megan 
Anderson placed first, Esther Merki 
took third and Patrick Fischer placed 
ninth in their respective age groups. 

At the Damn Sprint, Dave 
Schurig came in third. The team 
has a number of events in the near 
future, including nationals at San 
Luis Obispo.

Water Polo: 
Tritons topple 
Roadrunners in polo 
Continued from page 20 

Triton . Runners Say Goodbye 
·Top performer James Nielson and others to graduate 

end of the quarter, UCSD held a 
narrow lead of 5-4. 

UCSD scored four goals in a 
row in the fourth. The increas-
ingly desperate Roadrunners 
commited more fouls and 
watched two of their players get 
ejected for the rest of the game 
as Rodriquez scored one more 
goal to end the game. 9-5. 

While assistant head coach 
Robin Bregman attributed the 
team's initial flat playas "dis_ 
couragement" after the loss to 
Davis the day before, "the fact 
that we have lots of team speed, 

- and we played with such depth -
a total of 14 players" eventually 
overcame the smaller, slower 
Roadrunner team of only 12. 
Sanders called the failure of 
many offensive opportunities 
the Tritons' "Achilles Heel - its 
been our weakness all year. 
When we get man-up opportu-
nities, we convert about 30 per-
cent of the time, and to win you 
need to be 50, 60... It 's been 

- frustating all year to lose to 
strong Division I teams by only 
one or two goals after leading 
going into the final quarter 
because we need to put the ball 
in the cage on our opportuni-
ties." 

onetheless, Sanders was 
very pleased overall: "We had a 
great season, going 20-13, beat 
some very strong Division I 
teams like 5th-ranked nation-
ally Cal State San jose, and I 
believe we can come back even 
better next year from learning 
from our close losses," 
Sanders said, pointing out that 
the team had only one player 
graduating .

legiate Athletic Association Divi-
sion II cross country champion and 
is the UCSD record holder in the 
1,500 meters and the 10,000 
meters. Nielson is one of only four 

CAA All-Americans for cross 
country at UCSD. 

Wangler had strong moments 
during his UCSD career, coming in 
sixth in the Point Loma Nazarene 
Dual in 1999. 

Wu is one of the best-ever mid-
dle distance racers for the Tritons, 
finishing No.5 all-time in the 800 
meters, and No. 6 in the 1,500 
meters. She is a leading member of 
UCSD's NCAA Regional Champi-
on Team in cross country in 2000. 

Scott led the seniors in winning 
the conference 3,000 meters and is 
currently No. 5 for UCSD at that 
distance, as well as No. 3 in 5,000 
meters. 

Kitchen is the No. 2 all-time 
leader in Triton history in the 
10,000 meters and competed at the 
nationals for cross country in 1997. 

"These are extremely special 
members of UCSD's program. 
They have represented the univer-
sity and its student body at true 
levels of excellence: said cross 
country head coach Ted Van Ars-

I am not sure, though, how they 
would be paid for. The failure of 
the fee referendum last week sends 
a message. There will be difficulty 
keeping things going, let alone pay-
ing those who are most important 
to athletics, the athletes. 

Without scholarship of some 
sort some day in the next few years, 
we may quit being competitive. It is 
hard to compete with schools with 

dale. 
All these seniors have had 

their share of injuries, halting 
their running and racing activi-
ties for a period of time. Scott 
and Kitchen's injuries kept them 
from racing fer over a year. Yet 
all these seniors kept their 
poise, fought through adversity 
and raced to their utmost abili-
ty. 

"Each senior remained com-
mitted to achieving their per-
sonal goals and returned top-
flight performances," Van Ars-
dale said."This is an example of 
perseverance at its best, and the 
type of quality person who sets 
the type of example younger 
people need to see. No quit! " 

Remarkably, these seniors all 
maintained a grade point aver-
age of 3.5 to 4.0 while training 
20 hours and running as much 
as 1 00 miles every week. 

"It takes a tremendously 
strong person to achieve perfor-
mances of the likes mentioned 
above while establishing one's 
self in preparation for the real 
world and maintaining excel-
lent academic status," Van 
Arsdale said.

y ou know, going to school is not that easy. At least it's hard to go to school and 
excel, to get all or mostly A's. Some 
can do it without any effort. Some 
can do it. but they need to work 
really hard at it. I fall under a third 
group: those who have to work 
really hard and have to have some 
luck to pull respectable marks. 

Education ain't easy. That 
brings me to my point: What the 
UCSD student athletes do is a 
pretty remarkable thing. They bal-
ance school and sports, and many 
of them excel at what they do. 

Athletes have often been looked 
down upon as a group that is good 
on the field but that just gets by in 
the classroom. At times, this holds 
true. Man, I knew some people 
back in high school who could sink 
a three-pointer blindfolded but had 
trouble multiplying one by itself 
(Um, the answer is one, I think). 

This also holds true at certain 
universities around the country. 
Jocks just barely stay on the team, 
just barely keep scholarships, just 
bardy remain able to go on and 
make millions 111 the NBA or NFL. 

This is not the case so much 
any longer. More and more, 
schools are demanding excellence. 
I mean, look at Duke University: 
national champs in men's hoops. 
And this is DUKE of all places. 
They don't Just let anyone attend. 
You have to have a head on your 
shoulders. 

Stanford is another example. 
Excellent basketball program. 
Freaking geniuses in the class-
room. You don't go there unless 
you have some brain power, and 
the athletic ability is secondary. 

Well , coming back around to 
our neck of the woods, some day 
the above scenarios could happen 
here. Look out. I'm about to use 
the Sword - scholarships. 

After thll1king a bit, scholar-
ships could work here. We cou ld be 
a Division II Duke elr Stanford. 
Excellence in both the classroom 
and on the field. 

Many are against scholarships for 
athletes. Many feel it takes away from 
the prestige of an educational institu-

.tion. Many fear the thought of dumb 
Jocks just getting by, being enrolled 
because they can kick a soccer ball. 

Well, let's just hold them to the 
same academic standards. Actually, 
that is how it is now - no matter 
how well someone plays tennis, he 
has to meet academic requirements 
to become a lriton. 

So give them scholarships, at least 
partial scholarships. You have no idea 
what athletics can do for a college. If 
the athle tic program is excellent 
(such as ours is), it adds prestige. It 
gets you on ESPN. Then more peo-
ple want to come here, and "Triton" 
could become a household word . 

The college experience is not 
complete without heading out to 
the games to support your school. 

Is it unfair to give scholarships? 
Not if athletes keep their grades up.

UCSD Athletes Recognized 
Tritons Honored by UCSD on Student-Athlete Day 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Have you ever heard the term 
"dumb jock"? Well , it must have 
been back in high school, because it 
does not apply around here at 
UCSD. 

On Thursday, UCSD Intercolle-
giate Athletics honored 10 Triton 
student-athletes at a luncheon in 
recognition of the 2001 National 
Student-Athlete Day. 

UCSD chose to honor a male 
and female athlete from each of the 
five colleges. Representing Earl 
Warren College were Sara Patton 
and Matt DeFord. 

Patton is a sophomore structur-
al engineering major and is a mem-
ber of Triton crew, rowing in the 
varsity eight boat. She also bo~sts a 
healthy 3.74 GPA. 

"I think being on [crew] actu-
ally helps me a lot with my school-
ing and athletics," Patton said. 
"With all of that time management, 
when I get busy, I get a lot done. If I 
wasn't on.a sports team, I think I 
would slack off a lot in my classes."

DeFord belongs to the track. and 
field team in addition to othfr Tri-
ton activities. He is a graduating this 
June with a degree in literature in 
English and classical studies and 
has a 3.74 GPA. 

"I think it's absolutely key in any 
experience," he said. "Just being a 
student-athlete, the nature of it is 
such that you aspire to greatness 
and excellence both inside the 
classroom and OLit on the field . It 's 
tricky at times. But overall it pro-

vides its own balance in a way. " 
Honored from Revelle college 

were cross country's Nathan Garcia 
and basketball's Nicholle Bromley. 

Garcia is currently doing gradu-
ate work in teacher education, and 
sports a 3.76 GPA and good time 
management. 

Bromley is a sophomore study-
ing biology and has a 3.53 GPA. 

From Marshall college, Kevin 
Flynn and Jamie Woods, both vol-
leyball players, were also hono~ed. 

Flynn is graduating in June with 

a 3.55 GPA in computing and the 
arts, and Woods is a junior studying 
mathematics in secondary educa-
tion, and boasts a 3.65 GPA. 

John Beaven of the baseball 
team and swimmer Lindsay Meeks 
were recognized from Muir college. 

Beaven is a junior studying biol-
ogy and has a 3.55 GPA, and Meeks 
is also a junior, studying biochem-
istry with a 3.77 GPA. 

From Roosevelt college, Kamyar 
Daneshvar and Audrey Sung were 
recognized. 

Daneshvar is a sophomore 
studying political science and has a 
GPA of3.64. When he is not hitting 
the books, Daneshvar can be found 
rowing as a member of Triton crew. 

Sung is a sophomore tackling 
biochemistry and cell biology. She 
is doing just fine with the books, 
holding up a 4.0 GPA. When not 
running circles around labs and 
exams, Sung is running circles

UCSD Water Polo Places Third 
Tritons Beat CSU-Bakersfield to Finish the Season

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's water polo 
team finished third in the Women 's 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championship tournament on 
Sunday, beating the CSU Bakers-
fie ld Roadrunners .9-5 to wrap up 
their home season at Canyon view 
Pool. Loyola Marymount Univer-
sity, the winner of the UCSD-host-
ed three-day tournament, 
advanced to semifinal berth in the 
NCAA Championship tourna-
ment. 

Sunday's game against Bakers-
field followed a heartbreaking 5-4 
loss to UC Davis the day before. It 
forced the third-seeded Tritons 
into the consolation game for third 
place, while Davis advanced to 
contend for the NCAA berth. 
While the Tritons had led the game 
3-2 going into the final quarter, 
Davis ' three goals put them over 
the top as UCSD managed only 
one goal in response. Leading the 
lritons in that game were Dana 
Tucker and Samara Silverman, who 
had two goals each. 

"We played really well, but in 
the final quarter we had a lot of 
opportunities but did not convert 
them; head coach Larry Sanders 
said, "That's kind of been our MO 
all year." 

The disappointed Tritons 
returned to the pool the next day to 
battle the Roadrunners in what 
proved to be a physical game. The 

Tritons controlled the flow of play 
with a num ber of steals, and often 
forced Bakersfield to run down the· 
shot clock. While the Roadrunners 
could not get outside shots off, 
th eir inside set player, Dawn 
Rodriquez, scored two goals, sur-
passing the one goal by Emma 
Kudritzki for the Tritons. 

Th~ again had trouble con-
verting their offensive opportuni-
ties, in spite of numerous penalties 
against the physical Roadrunners, 
who were getting sent to the penat-
ly box as fast as they could rejoin 
the game. By the end of the second 
quarter, the Tritons' Gourtney 
Hemmerly had scored a goal to 
bring the Tritons to a tie. 

After halftime, the Triton offense 
started to dominate the game, scor-
ing three goals in the quarter while 
Bakersfield continued to take penal-
ty calls from the referees. UCSD still 
had trouble converting these offen-
sive opportunities during this quar-
ter. Only in the forth, by using time 
outs to set up their offense after Bak-
ersfi Id had lost players to penalties. 
Although the Roadrunners opened 
the quarter with a goal, the Tritons 
immediately responded with an 
inside tally of its own by Thcker. 
After UCSD took the lead 4-3 later 
in the quarter, Bakersfield called a 
time out to set up a special play, only 
to see it work against them as UCSD 
beat them to the other end of the 
pool and score another goal. By the
