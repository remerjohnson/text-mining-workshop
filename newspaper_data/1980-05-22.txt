Reaga·n Appeals to 
Those Nostalg~,c for 
America of the 50s 

BY FRANK VIVIANO 
Padfie Newt Service 

If Ronald Reagan is elected to the presidency next 
November, his success will have less to do with specific policy 
• tatementl than it will with a very broad - and emotional -
campaign pledge. 

After nearly twenty:five years of foreign poli~y setbacks 
and the gradual erOSIon of the consumer ethic, Reagan 
promises to re.tore the faith of the 1950., when TIme 
magazine publisher Henry Luce wal proclaiming "The 
American Century:" an era in which American military 
power went virtually unchallenged and the booming US 
economy seemed unstoppable. 

And, according to political analysts, it is precisely the 

Frank Viviano is a Pacific News Service editor. 

young adultl of that bygone era - and their children today-
who are Iiltening and believing. 
, For voters terrified by the implications of an era of limitl, 
the expansive ideology of the American Century carries 
powerful po~tical force . While President Carter has suggeilted 
that the challenges ahead are extremely complicated and 
may require national sacrifice, the former California goverrlOr 
insi.1I that happy daYI could be jUlt around the comer - and 
that they need not come at any expenle to the middle c1au. 
"The truth is that there are simple answers," he aaidrecently. 

"(Carter) trie. to make us believe inflation il our fault," he 
fold a Texas audience in mid· April. "He sa~ we're living too 
luxuriously, we're buying too many things. That isn't why we 
have inflation. Government caUlel inflation." 

To rectify that situation, Reagan p1An1to unlhackle private 
indUitry boom most ,federal controls, and vastly increase 
consumer tpending through a drastic 30 percent tax cut. The 
'pending, he argue., would provoke "an in.tant increase in 
prolperity." As for the po .. ibility thatauch a prograin might 
wreak havoc with dwindling ener~ re.ource., Reagan flatly 
denies that the energy crisi. i. real, The ptelident, he charlel, 
"hu made UI feel we're an energy poor nation. We'reenerav 
rich " pI . -

In foreign policy, he propoael a military rearmament effort 
so extenlive that "no other country on earth would dare lift a 
hand against UI." America, Reagan contendl, should be 

re.pected fQf ill might rather than loved for ill goodne ... 
Analysis of Republican primary returm conducted by the 

New York TImes and CBS indicates that the.e twin 
campaign promilel - expansion of the consumer economy 
and a military build.up - have their greatest appeal with two 
conltituencie.: white, middle·income voterl 45 and older and 
thole between 18 and 29. In Rorida, luch voters accounted 
for 86 percent of the Republican vote, in Wisconlin. 72 
percent. " 

Like Spiro Agnew in the early Seventiel, Reagan aIIO 
appearl to I:tave support from once·Dem6cratic rural 
Southerners and urban blue collar ethnics, as well as among 
bedrock auburban and small town Midwe.tern Republicans. 
But Agnew'l popularity - and Agnew' .• rhetoric - had a 
vindictive qu.a1ity'. It represented the undisguised ho.tiIity of 
middle America for the rebellious minorities and young 
people of the chaotic Sixties, arid for the Eastern liberal 
e.tablilhment which wu believed to encourage their 
disturbance. of the national peace. ' 

Today the Sixties are a waning memory and Reagan'. 
appeal hal itl lOurce in a somewhat more benign 
conservative impulse which transcends age, class an~ 
traditional party divisionl.Although the militant foreign policy 
and reduced commitment to lOciai welfare embraced in hit 
platform imply a dangerous underclDTent of resentmentl, on 
the surface Ronald Reagan'l vision is a positive one. 

For older voters in the new Republican coalition, that vision 
recalls a moment IOmetime around 1955 when the American 
Century wu in full, if only brief, flower. 'Theae voters were 
young ~dul.ts then~ enjoyi~ the ~It phenomenal ~onomic 
boom m hlltOry, 11'1 a nation uruver.aIIy thought to be the 
strongest on earth. 'The national mood, Henry wee exulted, 
"was firm confide. ICe in the American economy and in 
dynamic capitalism aI an economiC way of life:;' 

"The air ring. with u,.e songs of our indUitry - rolling milia 
and blalt furnaces, dynamo., dams, and allembly ~ne. -
the choru. of America the bountiful," President Eilenhower 
decillred . 

But firm confidence hal wilted into mus uncertainty since 
the Eisenhower yearl, and until Reagan shifted the focUi of 
hi. campaign from allgreslive thrustl at the left to rOlY 
aller-tionl that a boom could be rekindled, nobody had lUng 
the chorus of American the bountiful in a very long time. 1he

Chemical Wastes 
Force Evacuations 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent Carter declared a state of 
emergency for New York's 
Love Canal area yesterday 
a nd said the. ·federal 
government will pay to 
evacuate 710 families while it 
conducts new studies on the 
health dangers of 21 ,000 tons 
of abandoned chemical 
wastes. 

Officials said the voluntary 
evacuation would begin 
immediately. The famihes are 
to be housed in motels, 
apartments, hospitals and 
vacant Army living quarters in 
the Niagara Fall, NY area. 

The cost of the relocation 
and housing for up to a year -
expected to be between $3 
million and $5 million - will 
be shared by the federal 
governm~nt and the state of 
New York. 

The government response, 
however, falll far ahort of the 
permanent relocation Love 
Canal residents have been 
demanding. 

" 'I want to get out 

permanently, " said John 
Wright, an area resident. "I 
don't like this 'temporary for a 
year.' I might be dead in a 
year· " 

Louise Gibbs of the Love 
Canal Homeowners Associ· 
tion said yesterday a White 
House official, whom she did 
not name, had told her that a 
disaster declaration enabling 
the federal government to buy 
the homes would be issued "in 
the next couple of days." 

Officials dispute her 
contention, however, and said 
no decision would be made 
until after the new health 
studies are completed : 

"But the studies completed , 
to date are sufficiently 
suggestive of a threat to public 
health that prudence dictates 
the residents be relocated 
while further definitive studies 
are completed." 

, Ms. Blum said the dumping 
of toxic Waite. at Love Canal 
by Hooker Chemical Co. 
provided a "stark example of 
the problems."

Rent Control 
Bill Stalls 

SACRAMENTO - A 
constitutional amendment that 
one critic said would outlaw 
rent control stalled on an early 
roll call yesterday in the state

Hotel Chains 
Overcharging 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent Carter threatened 
yesterday to release the namel 
of hotel chaim that are not 
complying with his voluntary 
anti.iriflation program. 

"We have had a 
trouble " ' with the hotel 
industry, Carter said at a 
White House meeting with 
industry re presentatives . 
While some chains have 
"cooperated fully ," he said, 
there are 1 7 "that still have 
uncertain status as far as 
compliance" with the 
administration's guidelines.

SACRAMENTO - An 
wvnarried . rI under 18 who gJ . 
wanted an abortion would 
have to get the consent of her 
parents or a court, under a bill 
passed by the Senate 
yesterday. 

The measure, 5B1814 by 
Sen. John Schmitz, R·Corona 

. Del Mar, sponsored by anti· 
. abortion groups, went to the 
Assembly on a 21·12 vote, 
'the bare majority needed.

women under 18 got Medi-CaJ 
abortions in 1978, and an 
unknown number got privately 
financed abortions. 

The vote reflected the 
general anti·abortion 
sentiment in the ' Senate in 
recent years. 'The Assembly 
Health Committee; the bill's 
next stop, has killed· moat of 
the anti-abortion billa that 
hav~ reached. it. 

Since the US Supreme 
Court declared abortion to be 
legal in 1973, it hal struck 
down several state laws 
requirinr paren~ consent for 
minors' abortions. . 

But a recent ruling by the 
court appeared to leave room 
for a law that would give a 
mino'r who was rejected by her 
parenti the righllp get a court 
order, and Schmitz said he had 
tailored his bill to that ruling.

A Portrait of the Critic 

" ... On question 'of literature and art we must carryon a struggle on two fronl r. .. " 
- Mao Tse Tung, " Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Arl ' 

T he TV was on and no one was watching it. 
Two women stood in 

front of the set, their backs to 
the screen and stared at me. 
Leila and Sharon, I 
remembered. 1be twins. 

"What's your point?" asked 
Leila. A light flashed in the 
back alleys of my brain, and 
suddenly I recalled that I'd 
been in the middle of a long 
spiel that became more 
complicated the longer my 
mouth kept making sounds. 

It was a sudden gush of run· 
on sentences, punctuated with 
stutters and stammers, ·hardly 
a tail's length ahead of the last 
breath rd taken, that took a 

simple opinion - I'd said to 
them that I didn't like Bruce 
Springsteen, and Sharon 
asked me why - and tumed 

- the issue from a matter of taste 1 
into a dissertation on 
aes the tics . 

I was in great shape when I 
started, dropping- names like 
Croce, Dewey and Neitzche, 
pulling faels I didn't know from 
the air, drawing distinctions 
between thi'ngs I never 
considered before and feeling 
pretty brilliant until ' Leila 
turned around for a second 
and snapped on the tube. 

When the news came on -
Jerry Dumphy, in black suit 
and a head of grey hair 
combed into a pompador that 
looked like an oily dump of 
apun silver - my mouth 
closed and my eyes, double· 
visioned with wine, equinted at 
the set, trying to merge the 

. anchor man and his soul back 
into one corporal body. 

All those twisting inroads I 
was going to take washed 
away suddenly as my wits 
united into a single purpose: 
what was Dumphy saying? 
The sound was off and no one 
was talking. .' 

L eila, though, remem-bered the thin high. 
wire thread I'd been 

balancing on, and with her 
question, the situation in my 
apartment was suddenly 
reversed. Standing together 
with their close.crop hair, 
khaki.pants, white shirts and 
loose-fitting ties, they looked 
like punk.rock bookends come 
to life for an inquisition. I 
wanted to groan. 

"Sprin~.teen is a I!!i'th-
monger," I offered. They 
atared, waiting for me. 

BY TED BURKE 

" ... which is to say that 
instead of developing 
something unique in his work, 
he's appropiated a number of 
superficial stylistics from other 
people and makes music that 
sounds like everything and 
sounds like nothing." 

"You can say that about 
almost anyone in rock and 
roll," said Sharon, unfolding 
her arms and picking up a 
bottle of Summit Chablis. 
After she'd taken three large 
gulps from the spout, she went 
on. 

"Rock and roll is, and 
.a1ways has been, the art of 
theft. Elvis ripped off Arthur 
Crudup, the Stones swiped 

&re 
Wires 

from Motown, Zep from 
Howlin' Wolfe ... and yet no 
one really gets on the cases of 
those guys ' for what they 
did ... " • . 

"An old line," I said, "goes 
that the ama.teur borrows, the 
professional steals.' Spring. 
steen has borrowed a lot of 
stuff from others and doesn't 
sound like he knows what to do 
with them. The music,' the 
singing, the lyrics a:Jever come 
together, never give yoo a hint 
of anythin-g beyond the 
museum di.play case ... " 

"What's . that mean 1" 
demanded Leila, talkini 
through a yawn. 

"It's like Springsteen 
saying, 'Hey look, I got it all. 
Here'. Van MorrilOl'l, over 
there'. Dylan, I got Stax· Volt 
over there, and over here I got 
Phil Spector.' 

"I mean, Springsteen ian't,a 
rock and roDer. He'. tike a kid 

who collects baseball cards 
who wished he could have 
been a player himself, but who 
has to settle for less. I mean, 
tt:ere's a desperate frustration 
to his voice, his music ... " 

Leila and Sharon had 
walked to different sides of the 
li.ving room, by the door and 
the kitchen counter respective. 
Iy, with me at the center of the 
wall across the way. At the 
base of this triangle . was 
Dumphy and his ghost. Then I 
was attacked from both sides. 

"What's that?" asked 
Sharon. "You said earlier that 
the best rock and roll was the 
voice of frustration, and' now 
you say Springsteen's bad 
because he sings about 
frustration. " 

"Yeah," said Leila cheerily, 
her voice rin~ing like wind 
chimes. "What s the difference 
between him and anyone 
else?" 

T he room felt as though it were doing jumping 
- . jacks and looked like 

'two identical slides had 
superimposed each other at 
sharp angles. 

"I didn't say that," I said, 
"or didn't mean to ... make it 
sound like that. .. He's 
frustrated, and his characters 
are cardboard cut-outs ... He 
could write a song about 
getting a pack of cigarettes 
and make it sound like a life"or 
death proposition .. . " 

"Sometimes it is," said 
Leila, putting on her jacket. "I 
mean look at where you live. 
Don't tell me you walk down 
Hfth and feel secure ... " 

"Yeah, but," I said, nodding 
my head and then shaking it in 
a conflict of reactions. I must 
have looked like one of those 

. animal·shaped coin banks 
with the head on a spring that 
bounced and bobbed any way 
the earth moved. 

Sharon put her jacket on as 
well,as the rug pulled ilidf 
from under us. I feU hMvily 
into a d~r, and a stream of air 
hissed through the holes in the 
cushion. 

The two.of them were at the 
door. "Golta go," said Sharon, 
smiling. "Anyway, thanb for 
the concert. Get some aIeep." 

"Yeah," said Leila, "we'l 
see you in the office tomorrow.

Reagan in '50s 
Continued from page 2 ' 
auperi.ority of the American way of life is not endangered. 

Reagan's campaign success With the 18-to 29-year-old 
electorat~ is more surprising, but not altogether remarkable. 
Young voters have grown up in a period of American history 

ked chiefly by national failures: the Bay of Pigs in their 
childhood, the auassinations and civil disturbances of their 
adolescence, humiliation in Vietnam, political turmoil over 
Watergate, additional humiliation in Iran. 

More important, perhaps, they have come of age in an era 
when ~ignificant elements of the American dream - owning 
a home, driving great distances 'in a fast car, and finding a 
good job to ry for them - have become impossible for large 
riumbers 0 Americana. In 1955 fully one-half of the 
populaton could ex~ct to purchase a single-family home. 
Today less than five percent ~'ln. 

It is also worth observing thai young voters today are likely 
to be children of Ar'nericans who reached maturity at the peak 
of the great boom. They pass on the same 'distorted, golden 
memory of those times that television's Happy Days pictures. 
"There's a good chunk of nostalgia in what he represents," 
former H.E. W. secretary Robert Finch says of Reagan. _ 

But it is a nostalgia that sell. very well in a nation exhausted. 
by defeats and fearful of the economic future. 

Left out of the picture, of course, are minorities, the poor , 
and the middle portion of the electorate - the aging youth of 
the Sixties - who have stuck with the Democratic Party or 

, more moderate Republicans like John .t\nderaon. ' 
Whether or not these voters retain anything resembling the 

,radical political views which some of them entertained a 
decade ago, most of them appear convinced that this is an era 
of inescapable limits. As a result, their conception of 
American reality is utterly at odds with the Reagan vision, for 
it paints the expuion of US consumption and military action 
Bike as threats, rather than promises. If Reagan .upporter. 
lOok back to the expansive mid-Fifties for a poeitive IUide to 
the future, a good nwnber of hia detractors Icdc ba~ to the ' 
cautious early Seventies for political cirec:tion. 

In that Mnae, the 1980 election may be a significant t_ting 
01 two contradictory conceptions of reality both grounded in 
the past: Reagan'. energy-rich, bellico.-e siant 01 1955 
against the more humble America of 1974, IOberIy accepting

BOB DAVI$ 

"bye" together, and left. I 
stayed in the chair, staring 
stupidly at the door, waiting 

/ for the room to stop moving, 
with thoughts drifting in and 
out of my consciousness like 
driftwood waiting for the one 
wave to lodge it on a beach. 

W hat was wrong with this picture? And , what was wrong with 
the one just before it? These 
thoughts were getting me 
nowhere, and making me 
dizzy as well, so I picked up a 
copy of Zounds, a local rock 
and roll magazine, and flipped 
the pages, to the record review 
section. 

I read the headline, half 
lidded and tired~ and groaned 
this time. 

"SPRINGSTEEN'S HE-
ART OF DARKNESS: 
SALVATION ON THE 
STREET CORNER." 

More shit, I thought, more 
of the same shit. Squinting, I 
read the first paragraph 
though the words seemed to 
swim on the page: 

Quite unlike rock and roll 
artist of the age, Bruce 
Springsteen has proven 
himself more than equal to the 
task of making rock and roll a 
music that deals with values, 
attitudes and the romantic 
search for something of value 
in an urban terrain of heartless 
concrete and asphalt. 

'His search for the light at 
the end of the tunriel is the 
search aD of us are on. It 
wouldn't be tQ6-far-fetched to 
say that Springsteen has re-
defined the American Dream, 
making it cohere with tough 
new realities, and yet retain the 
essence of that dream u it 
gives it a new legitimacy .. .' 

I lowered the magazine and 
removed my glasses, 
wondering what big-mouth. 
wrote this tripe, lhis vile, 
my.tifying tripe that wun't 
critici.m but hero-worlmp 
dreaed up in campaign 
rhetoric, and then felt my 
.tomach knot painfully. 

A .udden , dread of 
falbiliarity swept through my 
1mb.. Everybody has the right 
to be wrong.
