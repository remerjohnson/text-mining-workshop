Stanford Professor 
Under Investigation 
PALO ALTO, Calif. - The 
federal government is investi-
gqting a transfer of telecom-

China which involves two 
Stanford professors and U.S. 
Defense Secretary William 
Perry. Pentagon officials say 
they are examining the transfer 
of telecommunication 
technology to a Chinese 
company run by a former 
communications director of 
the Chinese military. The 1993 
deal involved two American 
companies, one of which was 
at the time run by Stanford

John Lewis. Investigators 
allege that Lewis used his 
friendship with Perry to slip 
the technology transfer past

A.S. Launches Voter-Registration Drive, 
Seeks to Raise Thrnout by Five Percent 
ELECTION: Volunteers 
inform students about March 26 
bal10t propositions 
By Matthew Kalinowski 
Staff Writer 

Several hundred additional UCSD students 
will be eligible to punch ballots in the upcoming 
primary elections, as a result of the Voter Regis-
tration and Education Day held on campus thurs-
day. The event, hosted by the A.S. and California 
Public Interest Research Group (CaIPIRG), con-

~tituted an effort to increase student-voter turnout 
by at least fi ve percent. 

Voter registration tables were et up at four 
different 'pots on campus from II a.m. to 2 p.m., 
each laden with proposition information pam-
phlets, voter regIstration cards, absentee ballots 
and various other materials relating to amend-

ments and proposition, on the March 26 ballot. 
According to A.S. Vice President External 

Brian Dowd, more than 200 students registered to 
vote during the event, and about 100 students 
filled out absentee ballots. 

"It was definitely a very positive event," Dowd 
said. "It touched mo t of the student body." 

Thursday's voter registration day, the largest 
of its kind ever held at UCSD, fell just days before 
today's deadline to register for the primaries. 

Dowd estimated that approximately 90 percent 
of the student who stopped by the information 
tables were already registered, and that 90 percent 
of tho e who came by the tables who were not 

regi~tered did so on Thursday. 
"We were way above our goal in terms of 

registering students to vote. A far as students 
actually voting, that' the next step," A.S. Stale-
wide Affair Director Greg Field said. This year's

Tijuana Spill 
Misses Area 
Beaches 
TOXIC: Severa] million 
gallons of waste flow into 
ocean via Tijuana River 
By Chris Schreiber 
Staff W"ter 

La lolla·area beaches may ha ve avoided 
a toxic disaster last weekend, as wmds and 
ocean swells from the north pulthed 2.5 
million gallons of raw sewage back to-
ward Mexican waters, following a maj r 
waste pi II on Feb. 20. 

Mexican efforts to upgrade the Cortel 
Canyon Pumping Station in Mexico, so as 
to alleviate the chronic problem of waste 
nowing into the ocean, backfired late last 
week, sending the sewage into the Tijuana 
River Valley. 

For several days following the spi ll , 
coastline recreation areas a~ far north as 
Imperial Beach were dosed. Numerous 
San Diego beachgoers reported health 
concerns, and even UCSD-area surfer!) 
were apprehenSIve about gOIng in the 
water. 

"I don't know why they can't keep all 
their sewage on their own side of the 
border and quit c10si ng down our beaches," 
said Keith Yamano, a Warren senior and 
frequent surfer. " It seems as if the beaches 
are always closed or dangerous due to 
stuff coming out of Tijuana." 

The closed U.S. beaches were reopened 
on Sunday , however, after county health 
officials conducted secondary contamina-
tion tests. ounty Department of Environ-
mental Health officials also said they were 
confident the majority of the sewage will 
not reach La Jolla and will be eventually 
forced back to Mexico. 

The spill wa initially caused when the 
Mexican governmenl attempted to install 
a bypass in the Cortez Canyon Pumping 
Station, which would reroute the sewage 
to the Mandero Canyon Pump. During 
construction, workers shut down the Corte I 
Station, and sewage backed up and over-
flowed into Smuggler's Gulch, which 
empties into the Tijuana River Valley. 

During the Feb. 20 initial spill , ap-
proxllnately 1.5 million gallon or sewage 
flowed into the Tijuana RIver over the

The Canadian Brass to Play at UCSD 
The Canadian Brass, a ciassicaUy trained group of 

musicians wh6se style spans Gershwin, Dixieland, comic 
antics, Bach and Mozart, will perform March 6 in 
Mandeville Auditorium at 8 p.m. 

The first chamber ensemble ever to tour the People's 
Republic of China, the Canadian Brass has performed in 
Europe, Japan, Australia, the Middle East and the 
former Soviet Union. 

"The players of the Canadian Brass managed to sneak 
some fine musical performances between the amusing 
sight gags and the frilly drag outfits,· a Chicago Tribune 
reviewer wrote of the group. "The result was an appealing 
combination of offbeat music and comic vignettes. ' 

Formed in Toronto in 1970, the Canadian Brass has 
made over 30 recordings. The group's latest release, 
called Brassbustersl, is a collaboration with the brass 
sections of the New York Philharmonic and the Boston 
SymphOny. 

Tickets are $25 for general admission, $20for UCSD 
faculty, staff and senior citizens and $18 for students. 
Tickets are available at the UCSD Box Office and 
Ticketmaster outlets. 

Four Guitar Styles Showcased at 
Guitar Summit on M .. ch 9 

Four distinct musical styles, each played on guitar, 
will be showcased when Guitar Summit performs at 8 
p.m. March 9 In Mandeville Auditorium. 

The four guitarists and styles are Kenny Burrell, jazz; 
Manuel Barrueco, classical; Jonna Kaukonen, folk; and 
Stanley Jordan, jazz and pop. Each will perform solo for 25 

minutes. The four will then play together in the finale. 
Kenny Burrell, born in Detroit, has played with Charlie 

Parker, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington and Benny 
Goodman. He has taught music courses at UCLA. 

Manuel Barrueco was born in Cuba and plays Latin-
American-style music and is the first guitarist ever to win 
a scholarship to the Peabody Conservatory of Music. 

Jorma Kaukonen plays bluegrass·style guitar and is 
one of the original founders of Jefferson Airplane. 

Stanley Jordan, originally from Chicago, went to Princeton 
University and has released grammy·nominated albums. 

Tickets are $25 for general admission, $20 for UCSD 
faculty, staff and senior citizens and $18 for students. 

UCSD Police to Form Senior 
Citizens' Patrol on Campus 

The UCSD Police Department is forming a Senior 
Volunteer Program to help patrol the campus. Partici-
pants will patrol the campus either on foot or on bicycle, 
report suspicious activity, assist in traffic control, finger-
print, help with lost-and-found property and answer non· 
emergency telephones. 

According to Crime Prevention Officer Alan Jenkins, 
the volunteers will help support the police in community 
'relations and crime prevention by being a visible pres-
ence on campus . 

Volunteers must be at least 55 years old, in good 
health, have a valid Califomia driver's license, join the 
national Retired Senior Volunteer Program and com-
plete the training provided by UCSD Police. 

For more information, call Alan Jenkins at 534-3644.

UCLA: Students 
aI.so protest CeRI 
Continued from pac. 1 
demands. 

"1 was there with other people 
who were progressively minded," 
UCLA sophomore Tricia Alvarez 
said. "By laking back our uni versity, 
we're laking back our education." 

SP-I and SP-2eliminatedthe con-
sideration of race, gender a.,d 
e"'nicity as factors in UC hiring, 
admissions and contracting. 

According 10 a report by the UC 
Officc of the President, the imple-
mentation of SP-I will result in a 50-
percent drop in Afncan-American 
admissions to the UC system, a 40-
percent drop in ChicanolLatino stu-
dents and a 70-percent drop in Na-
tive-Americans. As an alternative, 
UC administrators are planning 10 
implement new admissions criteria 
based on socioeconomic and geo-
graphic backgrounds. 

The rally was also held to protest 
the CCRl, which need 700,000 sig-
natures to be placed on the Novem-
ber ballot. The CCRI seeks to end 
discrimination based on race, gender 
and ethnicity in state agencies. 

Demonstrations against the imple-
mentationofSP-1 and SP-2arescl1ed-
uled for upcoming days at other UC 
schools. 

SPILL: New 
plant in the works 
Continued from ...,. 1 
course of four hours. Mexican 
government officials did not no-
tify the United States about the 
intended shutdown, which is con-
trary to provisions ofU .S.- Mexi-
can treaty and law. 

"There are ways of contain-
mentthat [the Mexican officials] 
are not using at thi s point." 
County Department of Environ-
mental Health official Cathy 
Sto're said. "Hopefully, after all 
of this hoopla, they will think 
twice about lelling sewage flow 
across the border." 

The Feb. 21 secondary spill 
occurred after Mexican govern-
ment officials were convinced 
that repairs had been completed. 
Further sewage backup resulted 
in the release of an additional 
one million gallons of sewage 
into the river, while work crews 
311empted to repair Ihe bypass 
line. 

U.S. Rep. Bob Fi Iner (D-5Oth) 
and MellicoConsul General Luis 
Herrera-Lasso inspected Ihe spill 
site on Feb. 21. BOlh pledged to 
work with each other to ensure 
that future sewage spills would 
be averted. Filner al 0 met with 
Mexican Ambassador Jesus Silva 
Herzog to question why the 

The UCSD Guardian 

United States had not been noti-
fied of repair work on the Cortez 
Canyon station. 

In light of these developments, 
San Diego officials are bolster-
ing efforts to complete the Inter-
national Wastewater Treatment 
Plant, a $400 million facility de-
signed to handie Mellican sew-
age. The facility was proposed 
by Fi Iner when he was a member 
of the San Diego City Council. 
He is now trying to assure fed-
eral funding for the project as a 
Congress member. 

"This is a bi-national coop-
erative effort to solve a 50-year 
problem." Filner said. "Up nits 
completion at the end of this year, 
the Wastewater Treatment Plant 
will prevent a contamination of 
the kind that occurred (on Feb. 
20 and Feb. 21 ] ." 

Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-ll11pe-
rial Beach) issued a news release 
on Feb. 21 stating his intention to 
make efforts to get the new scw-
age-treatment facility up and run-
ning as soon as possible. 

The treatment facility has been 
criticized by some environmen-
lal activists, who contend that it 
cannot handle the purported 13 
million galluns of urban runoff 
which flows into the Tijuana 
River daily. Environmentalists 
favor the idea of constructing a 
series of ponds to handle Ihe Gon-
taminated water.

PINION 

UCSD Charter School Would be a Pipeline 
To the UC System for Low-Income Students 

By Andrew Sutherl .. d 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Before you fold up this issue 
of the Guardian and shuffle off to 
your next class, consider this: Un-
der the regents' new admissions 
criteria, only 148 Afri.:an-Arneri-
can students out of the 12, 521 who 
applied last year could allend 
UCSD. Now consider that. the 
numlx:r of eligible Chicano stu-
dents would be cut in half from an 
actual 1,115 to a projected 616. 

These disturbing figures seem 
billerly ironic in lieu of the 1960 
California Master Plan for Higher 
Education's mandate that UC 
schools educate representative 
segments of the state's population. 

Feeling powerless, it may Ix: 
tempting for you to I/)' to ignore" 
this depressing state of affairs as 
you concentrate on your work. 
After III, tackling the hisIoricaI and 
social conditions contributing to 
the sad plight of~ted 
UC students seems as difficult as 
a midterm in sIalistics. 

One of the foremost problems 
contributing to a lack of diversity 
in the UC system is the unequal 
quality of schools in the Califor-
nia public school system. 

Students from low-income 
backgrounds end up in poor school 
districts. Most of these students 
belong to the same minority 
groups which are 
underrepresented on UC cam-
puses. Because their schools lack 
the resources to adequately prepare 
their pupils, meeting UC admis-
sionscritcria for many of them Ix:-
comes nearly impossible. 

You can make a difference, 
however. In fact, the students, fac-
ulty and administrators of UCSD 
havc the opportunity to make his-
tory by supponing and fostcring a 
remarkable plan 10 stan a revolu-
tionary new kind of high school 
on the UCSD campus. 

A small group comprised of 
UCSD facully, underpduaIes and 
San Diego I.:ommunity members 
have developed a proposal for a

planners expect 
only a minimal 
expense to the UC. 
chaner school at UCSD under the 
provisions of the California Char-
ter Schools Act. 

The act allows interested par-
ties to create - rrom the ground 
up - a school within their local 
district which is free from many 
of the bureaucratic restrictions 
placed on traditional California 
public s<:hools. This makes it pos-
sible to reinvent wrriwlum, teach-
ing methods and every other as-
pect of contemporary public 

schools. 
The UCSD Charter School 

would provide a college-prepara-
tory education to approximately 
180 low-income high school stu-
dents bussed in from various San 
Diego County neighborhoods. 
These students would be ninth-
12th graders in the average 
achievement range who, accord-
ing to their teachers, perform be-
low their potential on standardized 
tests, despite being highly moti-
vated to succeed. By exposing 
them to a rigorous, innovative cur-
riculum designed by the director 
and associate director of UCSD's 
Teacher Education Program 
(rEP), the chaner school would 
give them the opportunity to im-
prove their SAT scores and com-
plete the "A-F" course require-
ments for UC eligibility. 

Such a school would help many 
of these disadvantaged students 
climb into the high achievement 
range required for UC eligibility.

COMMENTARY: The u.s. government has spent millions of dollars trying to combat a drug which not only is an 
idle threat to personal health, but is also able to relieve the suffering of AIDS patients and others 

WHY NOT MAKE MARIJuANA LEGAL? 
By N ...... PIetII. 
Staff Writer 

A recent editorial in a British 
medical journal, The Lancet -
equivalent to our own New England 
JourfllJl of Medicine - called for 
the fundamental reform, if not out-
right appeal, of current laws restrict-
ing the sale, use and possession of 
marijuana. 

It is one thing to give credence to 
firebrand advocale$ of marijuana le-
galization who claim that hemp has 
the potential to feed and clothe the 
entire world. It is quite another thing 
to recognize, as do the editors of The 
Lancet, that marijuana is not the 
scourge of cjvilization as its critics 
purpon. When a prestigious medical 
journal pronounces that "the smoking 
of cannabis, even long term, is nOl 
harmful to health," advocatesofmari-
juana prohibition should listcn. 

Even though research has indi-
cated that a typical marijuana ciga-
rette deposits in the lungs up to four 
times the tar and carbon monoxide 
of a single tobacco cigarette, the 
long-term smoking of pot can be 
considered no more dangerous than 
long-term, low-level tobacco use. 
Granted, immoderate smoking can 
lead to lung cancer, but even daily 
marijuana users ingest far less car-
cinogenic material than moderate 
tobacco smokers, according to such 
studies. 

Moreover, habitual marijuana 
users are not subject to nicotine ad-
diction, as are regular tobacco 

smokers. Indeed, little evidence ex-
ists that marijuana is addictive at all. 
Critics of marijuana are prone to de-
nouncing it as "psychologically ad-
dictive." But what "psychological 
addiction" really boils down to is the 
fact that people tend to repeat hav-
ing pleasurable experiences. 

Because of its status as a po-
litical hot potato, marijuana finds 
itself continuously denounced as 
being more dangerous than it re-
ally is. Health and Human Ser-
vices Secretary Donna Shalala 
claimed in a recent Wall Streel 
Journal editorial that "marijuana 
damages short-term memory, dis-
torts perception, impairs judgment 
and complex motor skills, alters 
the heart rate, can lead to severe 
anxiety and can cause paranoia 
and lethargy." If these effects were 
permanent and debilitating, we 
would have cause for concern. But 
these are short-term effects 
brought on by heavy usage. 

What is interesting is that these 
symptoms of hcavy pot use apply 
in spades to another powerful, but 
licit, drug - alcohol. Yet nobody is 
calling for alcohol 's prohibition . 
Our experience with prohibition in 
the first half of thi s century did 
much to disabuse us of that notion. 

Mere exaggeration doesn't go far 
enough ror politicians like Ms. 
Shalala. She claims, incredibly, that 
"in 1993, twice as many teenagers 
ended up in emcrgency rooms for 
marijuana use as for heroin and co-

According to a 1994 
report from the 
OffIce of National 
Drug Control Policy, 
only five percent of 
drug.related 
emergency room 
visits Involved

cainc combined." 

Howevcr, according to a 1994 re-
port rrom the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, only five perccnt of 
drug-related emergency-room visits 
involved marijuana, whereas 33 per-
cent involved alcohol and 28 percent 
involved cocaine. So who's telling the 
truth - Shalala or the statistics? 

1t needs to be pointed out that vir-
tually nobody goes to the emer-
gency room ror marijuana overdose, 
because marijuana has no lethal 
dosage. It's true that you can get sick 

-PREMIERE LECTURE EVENT-
PRESENTED BY AMERICANS FOR FREE CHOICE IN MEDICINE 

AND THE OBJECTIVISM STUDY GROUP OF UCSD. 

Is HEALTH CARE A RIGHT? 

HEALTH CARE: 

if you use too much, but emergency-
room visits for marijuana are hardly 
lire-threatening episodes. 

The most ludicrous aspect of the 
current war on marijuana is the em-
barrassing inability or law enforce-
mentto meaningfully cunail domes-
tic marijuana production. In 1984, 
a Drug Enforcement Agency offi-
cial proudly proclaimed, "This year, 
we're going to get rid or marijuana 
in Humboldt County once and for 
aiL" And, indeed, the campaign 
looked encouraging when plant 
eradication dropped 30 perccnt by 
1986. 

But by 1988, domestic production 
had reached double the 1986 level. 
The war on the production of mari-
juana cannot be won. Cannabis is 
very ea.~y to grow and conccal. It is 
laughable to presume that we hav:: the 
wherewithal to eradicate it. As Rogcr 
Warner has pointed out in his book, 
Invisible fland, it is ullerly ridiculous 
to think that any level of interdiction, 
short of a police statc, will prevai I ovcr 
the powerful market forccs of supply 
and demand. For every grower who 
is busted, one readily takes his place. 

What is most troubling about our 
war on marijuana is its inestimable 
human cost. Millions or private citi-
zens prefer to grow pot in their own 
homes rather than get involved with 
the drug trade. Although the crimcs 
or these mostly responsiblc citizens 
are victimless - for they often do 
not sellthc pot they grow to minors 
- they nevenheless risk stiff fines, 

Want 

eizure or their homes and Icngthy 
prison sentences. To totally ruin 
these people 's lives just because 
they like to smoke an occasional 
joint is unjustifiable. 

Even more remarkable is how little 
compassion we havc for people 
whose medical condition can be alle-
viated by the usc of marijuana. Smok-
ing potlcsscns the symptoms of glau-
coma, booSl~ thcdiminished appetites 
of AIDS patients and eases the nau-
sea and pain of cancer sufferers 
treated with chemotherapy. Although 
a synthetic form of marijuana 's active 
ingredient is available by prescription, 
it is less effective and actually pro-
duces more side effects than by smok-
ing the drug. 

Americans recognize we do not 
have the right to deny sufrering 
people a remedy for their miseries . 
A recent poll showed that 15 per-
cent of Americans believc mari -
juana should be legalized for medi-
cal use. Moreover, a Harvard Uni-
versi ty study indicated that 70 per-
cent or oncologists would prescribe 
marijuana if it were legal. 

If our laws are, as Shalala llssens, 
"cxpressionls] of our national values," 
what does it say about our values 
when the law denies relicf to people 
who are sutTering'! And what does it 
say about our values when we spend 
more money on marijuana interdic-
tion - the prosecution or victimless 
crimes - than on the education and 
prevention or irresponsible marijuana 
usc'!

Order Of Omega 
The Iota Epsilon Chapter of 

the Order of Omega was founded 
here at UCSD in 1988, but most 
people know lillie to nothing 
about the organization. For those 
who don't know, the Order of 
Omega is a National Leadership 
Honor Society. It was originally 
founded at the University of 
Miami, Florida in the Fall of 
19S9 and has since expanded to 
over 300 different universities. 
It's purpose was designed to be 
threefold. First, to recognize 
those students who have attained 
a high standard of leadership in 
inter-Greek activities, to 
encourage them to continue 
along this line, and to inspire 
others to strive for similar 
conspicuous attainment. Second, 
to bring together the most 
representative fraternity and 
sorority members, and to create 
an organization which will help 
to mold the sentiment of ~ 
institution on questions of local 
and intercollegiate affairs. Third, 
to bring together members of the 
faculty, alumni, and student 
members of the institution's 
fraternities and sororities on the 
basis of mutual interest, 
understanding and helpfulness. 

In other words, the organization's 
purpose is to foster unity among 
the Greek Leaders on campus, 
and provide them with an 
opportunity to share concerns 
about issues facing the Greek 
community and our campus. 
Here on our campus, the Order of 
Omega serves mainly as a think 
tank and in an advisory role to 
the lFC and Panhellenic boards. 
In addition to student members, 
the Order of Omega also has 
honorary faculty and alumni 
members. Such members on this 
campus include Tom Tucker 
(Assistant Vice-Chancellor of 
Student Affairs, Renee Barnell 
(Revelle College Dean), Paul De 
Wine (Assistant Director of 
Student Activities and 
Government), and Randy 
Woodard (Assistant Director of 
Student Organizations). In the 
past we have brought to our 
campus such events as Greek 
Awards Night and the AS 
Candidates Forum. After starling 
such programs, the Order of 
Omega usually turns over 
operations to IFC and 
Panhellenic. Currently, the Order 
of Omega is formulating an all-
encompassing, long term, goal

setting plan for the future of the 
Greek SY5tem here at UCSD. 
This plan will give much nceded 
direction to our suengthening 
system and is designed to enable 
the Greeks to better serve the 
campus and most importantly the 
student body. The Order of 
Omega is aliO in the midst of its 
annual new member selection 
process. As always, it is an 
extremely difficult process in 
that everyone who applies for 
membership has brought a great 
amount of success to themselves, 
their chapters, and the Greek 
System as a whole. The Order of 
Omega looks forward to their 
new members continuing to 
enhance our Greek System and 
our campus.

CHARTER: 
Continued from ...,e 4 

. Because many low-income San 
Diego families have a minority back-
ground, the school would naturally 
increase the number of competiuvely 
eligible, underrepresented UC appli-
cants without imposing the so-called 
"racial quotas" which have become 
the target of many conservatives. 

The charter school, which would 
open its doors in fall of 1997, would 
start with three ninth-grade classes of 
15 students each. A new group of 
ninth graders would be admiued each 
year for four years until a complete 
high school existed. The advantage of 
building the student body up gradu-
ally is the charter school's resources 
and experience can grow along with 
the student population. 

No course will ever have more 
than 15 students persession, and each 
student wi II be assigned a UCSD stu-
dent tutor so that he may progress at 
his own pace through th e core 
courses. Mathematics, language arts, 
social science/history and foreign lan-
guages will be taught with an empha-
sis on critical thinking, a concept 
which will better prepare these stu-
dents for college.

For the first two or three years, 
when the student population is small, 
the charter school would be located 
in the conference rooms below La 
Casa. By the time the school reaches 
a full level of attendance, the plan is 
to relocate it to a site along Voigt Drive 
near the medical center. 

Of course, the authors of the pro-
posal recognize that for prospective 
UCSD Charter High School tudents, 
allending a school so distant - and 
potentially alien - from their homes 
poses certain risks. Students may feel 
disenfranchised without a sense of 
community and home support. 

With this philosophy in mind, the 
school's designers included a provi-
sion for a parents ' council which 
would have authorit y over the 
school's governing board and would 
foster programs to bnng the students' 
communities together with UCSD's. 
Three highly successful San Diego 
community parent-~upport organiza-
tions- the Center for Parent Involve-
ment in Education. the Union of Pan-
Asian Communities and Parents for 
Involvement in Quality Edueation -
are currently. developing these ideas 
in conjunction with UCSD's charter-
school advocates. 

Because state Average Daily At-

The UCSD Guardian 

tendance funding should cover the 
proj«ted cost of the school, planners 
expect only a minimal ellpense to the 
UC - far Iesi. in fact. than many less-
innovative outreach programs. 

Also, because of the relatively 
small number of charter-sdlOOl stu-
dents and the obscure location of the 
classrooms, there would be almost no 
strain on campus resources or space. 
The relatively small investrnenton be-
half of the university easily merits de-
veloping thIs comprehensive response 
to the complex problem of campus d i-
versity. 

Bear in mind, however, that the 
charter school would benefit the uni -
versity in more ways than simply im-
proving diversity. 

For example. UCSD undergradu-
ate studenL~ would have a chance to 
cam credit toward graduation by tu-
toring charter·school . tudent . The 
~harter 'chool would give UCSD stu-
dent the rewarding experience of 
being a mentor. while a llowing them 
to fulfill course credits at the same 
time. 

Pcrhaps the most obvious benefit 
to UCSD is that TEPcould train pro-
spective teachers on campus, as well 
as develop innovative new strategies 
for public education in California. 

I NTU IT, a leading software development 
company, the makers of Quicken and TurboTax are 
now expanding their business into Cyberspace. We 
have Software Development positions available and 
will be on campus to interview on Monday, March 
11, 1996. 

We are interested in meeting Computer Science 
majors who have some experience or knowledge 
about developing, distributed systems, client server 
architectures or internet applications . We seek 
to hire those with strong analytical skills, the 
independent thinkers, and the high achievers . 

To leam more about these opportunities, please 
see your Career Services Center and schedule your 
appointment. Students from the Masters Program and 
undergraduates with high grade point averages are 
encouraged to apply.

Never before in the nation has a 
high school such as this been built. 
The support of UCSD's students and 
faculty is essential to see this truly 
original. egalitarian effort brought to 
fruition . 

Although the charter school has 
been formally endorsed by the Asso-
ciated Students, the Gllardian edito-
rial staff, thc board of MEChA, the 
Student Affirmative Action Commit-
tce. the Thurgood Marshall Student 
Council. the Graduate Student Asso-
ciation. many informed UCS D faculty 

OPINION 7 

members and several San Diego par-
ent aclivist groups, Interim Chancel· 
lor M3Ijorie Caserio' s office has yet 
to approve it. 

If approved, this innovative school 
could serve as a model for charter high 
schools at universities nationwide. 
Through its replication, it could po-
tentially change the Ii ves of thousands 
of low-income students beyond those 
served here al IJCSD. In so doing. it 
will help to improve the problem of 
minority underrepresentation at every 
UC campus.

VOTE: A.S. 
~gets myth of 
'apathetic youth' 
Continued from p.,. 1 
ballot date happens to be during 
spring break, a time when ' many 
students are out of town. 

"We wanted to make sure that 
[the date] doesn ' t cause any prob-
lems for students, so we have the 
absentee ballots here," Marshall 
Freshman Senator Andrea Santos 
said. 

Students working the registra-
tion tables wanted to dispel the 
notion of a politically apathetic 
youth. 

"If you're a student, and you 
don't vote, you don't have the right 
to complain," Roosevell sophomore 
Chau Ly said. "This is a way you 
can make a difference." 

At alllhe tables. A.S. members 
handed out preprinted "fee rollback" 
leller addressed to Gov. Pete Wil-
son, urging him to "please reduce 
fees by 15 percent" The leiter, writ -
ten by the UC Lobby Corps, had

The radio station Z90 was also in 
the Price Center on Thursday, sup-
porting the even! with announce-
ments encouraging students to reg-
ister and vote. 

"Z90 wants to help with the Rock 
the Vote campaign because there's 
so many students eligible to vote, 
[whol aren ' l." 290 representative 
Devin SCOII said. 

The environmental group 
CaIP[RG also had a booth set up, 
and distributed information urg-
ing students to VOle "no" on Propo-
sition 197, which would legalize 
the trophy hunting of mountain 
lions. 

Another booth belonged to the 
College Democrats, who were reg-
istering democrats and passing out 
information. 

"This campus is mo tly demo-
crat,.so we had a really good turn-
out today," said Warren senior 
Claire Hervey, president of the 
club.

FALLOWS: 
Journalists must 
convey less cynicism 
Continued from pace 2 
American public as a whole. 

"MyconLention is the press' habit 
o( conveying overwhelmingly the 
contemptible part of politics and 
politicians ... has contributed to the 
estrangement people feel from their 
political system," Fallow ' said. 

Communications Professor 
Dan Hallin saiu that today 's news 
business is a result of an overall 
change in philosophy within the 
indu try. 

"The change in the length of the 
sound bite represents a change in 
television news toward more jour-
nalist- entered news:' said Hallin, 
who has conducted intensive stud-
ieson thcgraduallydccreasing length 
of sound bites used in television 
news from the I 960s to the present 
day. "Today, the journalist is the 
main communicator in Ihc story, 
rather than the political candidate." 

Fallows concluded that the jour-
nalism profession must change the 
fundamental ways in which it ad-
dresses the news in order to survive. 

NEWS 9 

Hanh Nguyen/GuardIan 

Speech: Fallows criticizes 
contemporary news media . 

" rhe only market launching for 
journalism in the long run is to dis-
tinguish itself from entertainment," 
Fallows said. "[t can never be as 
interesting as Sally Jesse Raphael." 

" [n the long run, the fate of jour-
nalism, and the fale of democracy, 
are intertwined," he added. 'The 
only reason people will demand jour-
nalism is if they think lhey have 
some reason to know."

ris Haver has li'terally traveled to the ends of 
the earth to fi nd the perfect ski slope. At 30. 
he is one of only two people in the world to 
climb up and ski down the tallest mountain 
on each of the-seven continents. 

From Ihe sub -zero climate of the 
Ancarcti c to a looming glacier ri sing fro m 
the equalori al jungle, Haver has spent the 
last eight years of hi s life traversi ng the 
globe in a quest few others have dared to 

undertake. ! 
Now a successful businessman in San Di ego, 

Haver's mammoth jou.lley first began when he was a 
22-year-old student at San Diego State University. 
Having spent a year working in Vail , Colo .• his ski-
ing abililie were 'at Ihe point that he was ready to 
tackle something a little more daunting than Squaw 
Valley. 

Have ... ·s fi rst challenge was by no means a humble 
one. Mt. Everest. by all accounts. is the most chal-
lenging mountain ever scaled. At 29.028 feet above 
sea level, reaching the summit is a six-week journey. 

Haver joined Goodwill Expedition and enli sted 
the sponsorship of friends. family and corporalions to 
help defray the S75 ,OOO cost of the trip. 

For most. reaching the peak of this sublime moun-
tain is the primary goal. 

For Haver. it was 'he trip down. 
' 'The only reason I slarted climbing was that it 

was the only way to get where I wanted to go to ski ." 
he said. "The skiing is the fun part ; the climbing 
sucks." 

After conquering Everest, Haver sel the seven-
summit goal for himself. 

"1 just thought il would be fun to do the seven 
5:Jmmits before I was 30." he said. ' 'There were seven 
summits. and I was 23. and so ] figured I could do 
one a year before 1 was 30." 

However. an injury forced a three-year hiatus 
between hi s successful ski down Everest and hi s next 
conquest. Haver broke both of hi s ankles while jump-
ing off a cliff into a pond in Arizona. After several 
surgeries. Haver had his ankle bones fused. 

Despite..the setback, the goal remained intact in 
his mind. 

His friends were not as certain, however. 
"When 1 was first starting. nine out of 10 people 

said. ·No. you ' re crazy. it ' lI never happen,'" he said. 
"If 1 had li stened to everybody who said it wasn' t 
going to happen. I would have never done it." 

Defying his skeplics. Haver recovered and trav-
eled to Africa's 19.340-foot Ml. Kilimanjaro. While 
he termed the six-day hike as "an easy one," Haver 
admiued that its location on Ihe equator did not lend 
itsel f to outstanding skiing conditions. 

In the summ er of 1993. he headed north to 
Alaska's Mt. McKinley. a descent he described as 
"punishing." The hike itself wasn' t difficult. but his 
team got stuck in a storm for seven days. causing him 
to miss his high school reunion . 

The next year was busy, as· Ha ver concentrated on 
making up for lost time. He climbed Mt. Elbrus in 
Russia. an 18.510-foot mountain. then Australia' s 
Ml. Kosciusko. hardly a molehill at 7.310 feet . 

That same year, he stared down a challenge sec-
ond only to Ml. Everest. namely Mt. Vinson Massif

CLIMB: Peaks 
offer great skiing 
ContInued from .,... 11 
in Antarctica. Though lhe peak 
stands at only 16,864 feet, the 
frigid sub-zero temperatures (-50 
C) compounded mailers signifi -
cantly. But even a case of frostbite 
could not prevent Haver from ski-
ing this slope located at the bollom 
of the world. 

''That was a neat climb becau~e 
of the terrain and the fact that it 
was so remote," he said. "It was 
like being on a different planet." 

Because Antarctica isn't exact-
ly a favorite holiday de. tination for 
most people, the seemingly simple 
logistics of geui ng to t he moun-
tain's base were severe. 

Haver and his leam had to fly 
to the tip of South America - a 
long flight in itself - and then 
lake another six-hour fli ght to 
Palriot Hills, located in the inte-
rior of Antarctica. From there, it 
was another two-hour flight to 
the mountain's base, where the 
plane landed on the snow and sat 
for seven days until the climb 
was completed. Despite all the 
trouble , Haver found the effort 
we II worth i I. 

"[Antarctica I was probably the 
best of the ski descents," Haver 
said. 

It was also one of the most 
expensive. Since climbing Everest, 

OFT 
DAILY or EXTENDED 

Haver's work in international busi-
ness has allowed him 10 fund his 
own trips. He estimates that of the 
S200,OOO-plus he has spenl on his 
dream, nearly half of the money 
was spent on the Antarctica trek. 

Haver returned from skiing the 
last of the summits - the 22,834-
foot Mt. Aconcagua in the Andes 
- just days before his 30th birth-
day on Feb. 6. The second tallest 
of the world's peaks , this final 
climb was one of the tougher ones, 
hut not enough to prevent Haver 
from accomplishing his goal on 
s(;hcdule. 

Having faced the chi lling envi-
ronment of Antarctica's Vinson 
Massif, the rugged height of the 
Andes' Aconcagua and the fierce 
weather of Alaska'~ McKinley , 
Haver acknow ledged that Ml. 
Everest still holth the title of being 
the most arduous mountain to 
ascend. 

"Everest is in a Icague by itself 
because th e altitude is so 
ex treme," he said. "You spend so 
much time climbing above 21,000 
fect Ihat it really wears you out. 

"And it 's a long climb. You get 
sick of spending si", weeks on a 
mountain in a tent," he added. 

Looking back on his adven-
tures, Haver said he can't choose 
one favorite mountain. . 

" I've liked them all. Every 
climb offered something new and 
different and unique, and that was

Haver has made the most out of 
his extensive travels. In addition to 
viewing the world as few ever 
have, Haver has also visited the 
game preserves of Kenya, Zaire 
and Tanzania, the beaches of Fiji 
and the remote villages of th e 
Himalayas. 

Haver's climbs have been made 
with groups of friends, as well as 
with planned expeditions. Haver 
reponed that he knows of several 
people who have climbed all seven 
peaks, but only one of them - a 
Japanese climber - has actually 
skied down all of them as well.

And there's no wonder why so 
few people have completed the

you were to go out today and 
climb all seven summits, it could 
cost you a couple hundred thou-
sand dollars," he said.

tions found anywhere, Haver said 
he has never been in a situation 
where he felt he was in grave dan-
ger. 

"I'm pretty cautious," he said. 

Monday, February 26,1996 

"I'm not trying to kill myself." 
With years of hiking and skiing 

under hi s belt, Haver 's advice to 
people who may want to follow in 
hi s tracks has more to do with 
motivation than with skiing. 

"If you're committed to some-
thing , go ahead and do it. Go 
ahead and at least try ," he said. 
"People are too afraid of failure. 
Failure is actually good because 
you learn how not to do things." 

So where is Haver headed next? 
He said he wants to concentrate on 
his career for a while, but plans on 
toppling a few more obstacles 
somewhere down the road. 

"Maybe do something down the 
Amazon on a jet ski," he said, with 
a gleam in his eye.

Fencing Closes Season Strong 
Against Conference Foes 
CHAMPS: The ~omen's fencing team wrapped up the conference title, 
and Janet Wertz grabbed the individual crown in last weekend's action at 
Long Beach; men's sabre took second in conference, led by Ted Bertier 

By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD fencing team ended 
its season last weekend in a 
match up with four conference foes 

al Long Beach. 
In attendance to 

battle the Triton 
sword -wielders 
were USC, UCLA , 
Cal Tech and UC 
Santa Barbara . 
The meet marked 
the final competi -

tion of the ~eason for all involved 
before th e NCAA Wes te rn 
Regional s next weekend . 

The UCSD women posted an 
espec ially strong performance. 
clinch i ng first place in the South-
ern Ca lifornia Interco llegiate 
Fend I1 g Conference (SCIFe). 

Th e women of epee were 
largely unchallenged during the 
afternoon 's competition , as the 
undermanned teams from USC, 
UCSB and Cal Tech all forfeited 
their shots at UCSD's powerful 
epee team in an atlemptto match 
up bette r in the foi I competjtion. 
UCLA, the Tritons ' lone epee 
foe, proved to be no match, los-
ing. 16-0, to UCSD. 

The strategy backfired for the 
other teams as well , with the Tri-
ton foilers dominating all of their 
opponents. USC and UCLA lost 
by identical scores of 12-4, while 
Cal Tech (9-7) and Santa Barbara 
( 10-6) were similarly unable to 
find a chink in the Triton armor. 

Highlights fort he women were 
turned in by a trio of foilist s, 
whose performances brought a 
smile to the face of UCSD Head 
Coach Lisa Posthumus. 

Connie Szeto (15-1), Jennie 
Terrell (14-2) and Hannah Gri f-
fin ( 14-2) all enjoyed an ex-
tremely successful afternoon and, 
in the process. clinched ~econd in 
the conference for the Triton 
women roilers. 

''The gi rl s have only been fenc-
ing for about three month s," 
Posthumus said. "But they came 
togethcr and took everyone clse 
apan." 

Couplcd with the first-place 
finish of the incomparable epee 
team, UCSD's women finished 
first overa ll in the conference 
standi ngs. 

Janet Wertz was the conference 
champion in epee, accompanied 
atop the standings by teammates 

Suzanne Walters in third and 
Jeannie Rockway in founh. 

The men 's team had a strong 
day as well, especially in the epee 
and sabredi ciplines. Led by Matt 
Soskins' 10-2 record, the sabre 
team went 3-1 on the day, 10 ing 
only to Cal Tech . 

James Gerken mirrored 
Soskins' effort , goi ng 10-2 in the 
epee division. as the Tritons once 
again managed to get the beller of 
every squad but Cal Tech . The 
epee team narrow ly beat UCLA, 
UCSB and USC. sneaking pasl 
all Ihree teams. 5-4. 

The foilers. on the other hand , 
went 0-4. Triton foil found itself 
on the shon end of 5-4 scores 
agai nst Tech, UCLA and USC. 

The lone bright spot in this 
arena was Vikram Hatti ;who fin -
ished with an 11 - 1 mark 10 clinch 
a top-eight finish in the confer-
ence. Ted Ben ier led t he sabre 
squad to a number-two ranking in 
the conference for the season by 
earning a top-eight placing. 

"The conference re~ults were 
great," Po~thumus said. "Fo r a 
young squad that was pretty inex-
perienced at the beginni ng of thi s 
season, they really came through ." 

SMASH: UCSD 
was all over Chapman 
to earn its second win 
Continued from page 20 

Mike Wilson, filling the num-
ber-two slot fort he Tritons, marked 
the beginning of five consecutive 
si ngles sweeps for UCSD. Wil son 
pummelled James Baker, 6-1, 6-4. 
Meanwhile, teammate Eric 
Steidlmayer pounced on Kevin Hill 
carlyon and never let up, ousting 
t he Panther, 6- I, 6-1. 

The Tritons' Emil Mihet made 
short work of Jeremy Famularcano 
in the four position, winning his 
contest, 6·2, 6 - 1; while UCSD's 
fifth and siXlh men, Rahul Batra 
and Anthony Melicharck, pounded 
their Panther opponents by identi -
cal scores of 6- 1, 6-0. 

The doubles teams were unable 
to maintain quite the same level of 
domination. ahhoughcoach Turner

out of three to earn the lone avail -
able point in doubles. 

At number-one, Brounstein and 
Wilson cruised past Nakamura and 
Hill , 8-4, in the pro sel. SteveShabel 
teamed with Mihet , a combo usu-
ally found at number-three but play-
ing at number-two due to the ab-
sence of two players, to roll over 
Eric Koral and Baker, 8-2. 

The only loss of the day came at 
number-three doubles, where Ari 
Marken and Melicharek were ahead 
before falling, as a re ult of some 
error prone play. 

In addition, Marken suffered 
what was later diagnosed as a hip-
flexor, leaving him unable to make 
the necessary shots in a game that 
he and Melicharek lost , 8-5, to 
Famularcano and Ju an Melchor. 

The win rai sed the Tritons' 
record to 2-1 on the young season, 
with their only loss coming at the 
hands of Divis ion ( USD. Next up

NO PITCHING: UCSD could not stop its losing streak, faHing to The

The UCSD baseball squad com-
mitted the eighth deadly sin: los-
ing. And the Tritons suffered theit 
seventh consecutive defeat last Sat-

urday at Triton Sta-
dium, falling to The 
Master's College by 
a score of 10-6. 

While the 
hardballers arc not 
getting blown out of 
games, the slim mar-
gin of defeat can of-

ten be attributed to their own mis-
takes. This time, it was poor pi tch-
ing and untimely fi eld errors that 
cost the game. 

tive. scoring six runs and banging 
out 13 hits. Left-fielder John Gold-
smith accounted for three of the 
hits, recording a triple and two 
singles. The Mustangs were led by 
Jason Freeman, who went 1-3 with 
a home run and two RBI. 

"We're just goi ng to have to 
start winning," UCSD startin g 
short stop Mark 
Mason said. "A 
lot of the starters 
are pUlling a lot of 
pressure on them-
selves. trying to 
get the big hit. I 
think it 's going to 
take a team effort 
to get it done."

"At this point now. all the 

preparation that you can do physi-
cally on the field is not our prob-
lem," Fletcher added . "We need 
to have the confidence that we 
can win the little battles during 
the game. Fight now we ' re los-
ing Ihe ballles."

"We have both improved our 
height in every meet this year." 
Spector said. "And there's no rea-
son we shouldn ' t keep going up." 

"[Stary) has already proved he 
is one of the best in the nation at 
the Di visio n HI level." Van 
Arsdale added. "Now he has an 
athlete pu ~hing him. and that is 
going to get them hoth to the next 
level. " 

Other field highlights for the 
men were turned in by Derek 
Bennett (2nd, long jump). Geoff 
"Buzz" Lambert ( I st, hammer 
throw) and Randy Buehler (3 rd, 
shot put). Mall Scefield proved 
versatile in the field . finishing third 
in thejave lin and discus, and grab-
bing second in the shot put. 

The women also had a good 
day in the field , led by a Irio of 
high jumpers. Heather Winberry 
and Sabrina Nielson finished 1-2 
- both clearing 5'2" for personal 
records (PRs) - while Linda

third for the Triton sweep.

contest with eight runs in the middle 
innings. The Master's did not re-

der of the day for the remainder, as 
Tara Monaghan earned a pair in the 
hammer throw and discus, while 
Lisa Shepard captured a similar 
double in the long and triple jumps. 

Returning to the track. it wa~ 
clear that the Triton strength lay In 
the distance events where endur-
ance was the key. Gavin Klingler 
took first in the 3,000 metel s 
(8:42.58) while fellow crosscoun-
try pal 1.1. Castner did likewise in 
the 1.500 meters. 

UCSD's Maggie Dwire won the 
1.500 with a PRof4:54.27 . 1t wa~ 
once agaj, the challenge zone thai 
proved t I be Ihe di fference. as 
Dwire hlitzed the rest of the field 
over the final quarter of the race 

The 800 meters was anothe; 
sirong distance for UCSD, a~ 
Robyn Herskowi tz had a PR in 
wi nning the women's race. Goss 
Lindsey followed suit, capturing 
firs t for Ihe men. 

The highlight of the day for 
UCSD also came in this event. bu t 
not at the top, as one would expecl. 
Senior Steve Piette had his team-
mates on their feet as he crossed the 
line with a personal record of 
1:59.34. marking the first time in hi s 
career that the veteran had broken 
the two-minute barrier. 

As one of the hardest workers 
on the team, Van Arsdale was quick 
to credit Piette's run. 

"Steve has persevered more than 
any athlete I know," Van Arsdale 
said. ''To the normal spectator. thai 
wasn ' t where the race was, but that 
was a great performance." 

UCSD's final distaneeofchoice 
was the 400 meters, where the men 
finished 2-3 (Kevin Marsh and Jose 
Arciniega), as did the women 
(Odette Velasquez and Courtney 
Gray). Micheala Monahan further 
endeared the one-lap event to Tri-
ton fans . as the two-time national 
finisher took home a first-place 
finish in the 400 meter hurdles. 

Sprinter Juan Magdaraog was a 
mere two-one hundredths from 
speedy glory on this day as he 
finished third in the 200 meters 
and fourth in the 100 meters in 
each case a mere hundredth back 
of his nearest competitor.

formances agai nst Chapman and Cal

Having triumphed over Pomona 
earlier this season, the UCSD women 
are comfortable with Wednesday 'S 
home-court advantage and their 
chances. 

''They're a well-rounded team." 
senior guard Marcia Jeffries said. 
''They have five great athletes, but 
we're definitely better in the post 
area, and our defense is bound to 
throw them out of their game." 

The Tritons will focus on sharp-
ening skills and building intensity 
in practice today and Tuesday. The 
winner of Wednesday night's match-
up will most likely face top-seeded 
St. Thomas of Minnesota on March 
2 . 

The Tommies face UCSD's old 
friend. College of St. Bendict, in 
Wednesday's opening-round con-
test. 

"We're notoverlookin, Pomona, 
but we'rl thinking about flying to

UCSD's softball team (2-4), frus-
trated by defensive lapses and of-
fensive inconsistency, dropped a pair 
of games to NAIA Concordia Uni-

versity last Saturday at 
the Triton Softball 
Field. 

Mary Jane Otto took 
the loss in the first 
game. although it was 
errors in the field which 
led to the Tritons' un-

...... a.III. doing. 
Trai ling 1-0 in the top of the 

second inning, UCSD gave 
Concordia three extra outs and four 
unearned runs that, for alLpractical 
purposes, put the game out of reach. 
Concordia also took advantage of 
some late Triton mi~akes to take 
the opener. 14-5. • 

"Y OIl can't win a game when you 
have nine elTOrs," Triton Head Coach 
Patricia Gerckenssaid. "Basically, our 
fundamentals broke down." 

The Tritons have struggled oflate, 
dropping four straight games. 
Gerckens knows that her team has the 
physical tools to be successful, but her 
squad must learn to play as well in 
games as it does in practice. 

took to the hill in the second game, 
but the Lady Eagles kepi up their 
offensive intensity. toasting UCSD 
for 14 hits in the nightcap. 

The Triton bats came around a 
little in the second game, but UCSD 
couldn't string enough offense to-
gether to make a run. Quiet sticks 
coupled with porous defense spelled 
disaster. as Concordia took the sec-
ond game, 11-3. 

"There were a lot of missed cut-
offs and mental mistakes." Gerckens 
said of the Triton woes, which won't 
show up in the scorebook. 'They are 

stillleaming to play with each other." 
"In a way, I am looking for some-

one to step it up," Gerckens said. 
"But there is no star on the team. 
When we do win. it is going to be a 
total team effort." 

Junior shortstop Missy Belmer 
banged out atriple and was driven in 
by Shannon Reider. Belmer and 
Reider both went two for four in the 
sc<.'ond game. 

"Belmer is doing a great job at 
shortstop," Gerckens said. "She's a 
great athlete and hustles all over the 
place."

"Libby made some good deci-

SiORS," Lanthier said. "He really 
gOl. us going in the second half. 
He's becoming a great player, get-
ting better and better" 

The Tritons started their three 
seniors. who were honored before 
the game during the traditional 
opening ceremonies. 

''That was when I realized that 
this would be my last game." se-
niorco-captain Mall Minehan said. 
''The team effort and competition 
are whatI'll miss most." 

Senior guards Nick Berti no and 
David Dillon started in the Triton 
back court. 

Bertino garnered Most Inspira-
tional Player honors this year for 
his persistence in the face of adver-
sity. The senior point guard missed 
the first half of the season with a 
knee injury, but continued to work 
out and maintained his positive 
attitude. 

Dillon. who willjoin Lanthier 
and Assistant Coach Kevin 
Barbarick on the UCSD coach-
ing staff. was slarting against hi s 
former teammates from Santa

''The three of us wi II really

We keep getting better and bet-

Jones. Mike Ensley and Mark

season.

TO THE UCSD COMMUNITY 
. 

FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, a number of 
faculty, alumni, and students have considered the pOSSibility of start-
ing a CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL on the UCSD campus. This has prin-
cipally been a collaborative discussion between faculty in our Teacher 
Education Program and Thurgood Marshall College. The general out-
line of the project is to create an intensive and supportive academic 
high school (grades 9-12) whose mission is to recruit, admit, and in-
struct disadvantaged youngsters 'from low income backgrounds. There 
is to be only one college preparatory curriculum (UC a-f courses) 
taught by teachers recruited via a national search and aided by spe-
cially trained UCSD student tutors. 

The goal of the project, as proposed, will be to increase the 
academic achievement of selected low income students 50 that they 
are competitively eligible for entrance to the University of California 
or other selective universities. The presence of such a charter high 
school on our campus presents special opportunities for significant 
outreach, research, and teaching. 

The steering committee for this project has drafted a pro-
posal outlining the conceptual framework for the high school. At 
present, a local feasibility task force and the UCSD Academic Senate 
are reviewing the academic and non-academic elements of the proposal 
and will soon make their recommendations to Interim Chancellor 
Marjorie Caserio. While the review process unfolds, the steering 
committee is planning to host an all-UCSD Town Meeting to de-
scribe this initiative, and solicit comment anc! response from the 
broader UCSD community. 

The Charter High School Steering Committee is especially 
pleased that the UCSD Guardian and UCSD Associated Students 
hav recently endorsed this initiative. Since this is a major campuswide 
effort, we hope that interested members of the UCSD commu-
nity are able to learn more by attending the UCSD Charter High 
School Town Meeting in the Price Center Theater. Monday, February 
26th at Noon . Following a fifteen-minute presentation, there 
will be ample time for comments and questions.

Nazarene tournamenl, which was 
held at Ihe Sleele Canyon Golf 
Course in Jumul. pilled Ihe Tri -
Ions against five NCAA squads, 
including Ihe UniversilY of San 
Diego and Ihe aforementioned 
duffers from CSU San Bernar-
dino. 

The teams played 27 holes in 
the day-long event, competing 
on each of the Ihree nine-hole 
courses avai lable at Sleele Can-
yon. 

Allhough UCSD was unable

among Ihe top contenders for the 
Division II nalional crown. Ihe 
Tritons were up 10 Ihe challenge 
of knocking off the Toreros. edg-

gins: one stroke. 

That victory left UCSD in sec-
ond place among the five-team 

field. The Triton efforts were 
paced by Pete Roberts, whose 
morning round of 77 coupled 
with his one-over-par afternoon 
lally of 37 sparked Ihe win over 
USD. 

It was a clutch birdie by Rob-
erts on Ihe fi nal hole of the day 
Ihat clinched the win over Ihe 
cross-town rival. 

Robens was backed by a solid 
quartel of teammates. Arnie 
Campbell shot a 78 in the morn-
ing and followed wilh a 42 in Ihe 
afternoon, whi Ie Hunt "Golden 
Gopher" Cairns, a 6' 4" fi fth-year 
senior, tallied a 27-hole round of 
75-43. 

Brian Bazzell (82-42) and 
Greg "Barky" Barkdull (86-43) 
rounded out the UCSD lineup 
with solid scores. 

Friday's action on the links 
took place at the San Diego Golf 
Academy. a sorl of training 
ground for hopeful pros. Unfor-
tunately for the Trilons, San Ber-
nardino was once again in allen-

thunder. 

Among the other conlenders 
were Claremonl, Chapman, Oc-

"What hurt us in Ihe first half 
was that we were sloppy," Triton 
Head Coach Greg Lanlhier said. "We 
made some stupid mistakes and 
turned the ball over 14 times." 

" We knew il was going to be an

"At the half. we realized that we 

had to cut down on our turnovers," 
Aune said. "We were playing a 
lillie bit out of cl)ntrol." 

11le Tritons stepped il up in the 
second half and continued their de-
fensive pressure. 11le Slugs, who 
jumped out to an early 8-2 lead 
behind the sharp shooling of junior 
guard David Ndeto, faded in the 
opening minutes of the 'econd pe-
riod and struggled to control the 
ball, turning it over 25 times. 

Trilon freshman Mike Wall gave 
UCSD a big lift when he drained 
two, big three-point shots to push 
theTrilon lead 10 13poinls. UCSD's 
advantage never dropped below 
double digits for the remainder of 
Ihe contest. 

Wall finished with 18 points and 
six rebounds in limiledaction, leav-
ing Ihe game shortly after salting 
the slugs with his Ihird three-pointer. 

SRTV, the student-run lelevi-

ing Wall and Aune as the game's 
co-MVPs. 

" Ilhink they missedon Ihalone,"

KRAFTY 
DAN KRAFT 

A Call to the 
Wild ... 

Allention all face painters, 
funky dahcers and spirited 
maniacs. Calling all sports 
f:inatics, psycho fans and 
vestitudes of vociferation. 

This is it. There may be few 
games of consequence to you 
sporting sorts out there in 
Triton land, few contests which 
merit your allention; but if ever 
there was a chance to demon-
strate that UCSD does have a 
pulse of fandom, thi is it. 

Granted, this quarter has not 
been a grand one for Triton 
athletics, as the men's basketball 
team suffered through a sub-par 
season, while the volleyballcrs 
have struggled againstthcir 
Division I schedule. 

But the women 's basketball 
team has quietly - as if it 
could be done any other way on 
a campus which cares about as 
little for its college ath letics as 
it does for Peruvian poli tics -
had one hell of a season. The 
payoff comes this Wednesday, 
when the Tritons host Pomona 
Pitzer in' an opening-round 
NCAA playoff game - the first 
time in history that UCSD has 
hosted a postseason contest. 

The game will also mark 
RIMAC's first taste of NCAA 
action and intensity. Now, if 
only the students of this campus 

.. could match the intensity which 
will undoubtedly be on di splay 
at court level, this could be the 
kind of sporting event that has 
been sorely lacking at UCSD. 
So what if our hoopsters can't 
do all the stunts so oft demon-
strated at the Division I level. 
Does that make them any less 
deserving of our support? 

The quality of basketball 
here in the womcn's program 
has been sccond-to-none among 
California Division III schools 
the last two seasons, and UCSD 

I offers, plenty of bang for your 
buck with three-point snipers 
Cindy Yamasaki and Marcia 
Jeffries prowling the arc. 

All arguments about playing 
level aside, if there was a time 
this team deserved the backing 
of its school, it would be during 
this most crucial of games. The 
UCSD hoopsters have the 
potential to make a deep 
advance into the NCAA field, 
so if you have an ounce of 
Triton pride still pulsing in your 
mid-term exhausted blood, 
please show on Wednesday. 

Paint your faces blue and 
gold, or just wear a Triton T-
shirt. I don't care: but put your 
asses in those seats because god 
damnit, they've earned our 
support for at least one game.

Track and Reid Tramples. Foes 
THREE·FOR'()NE: The Tritons got the better of 
a trio of Division II opponents at home last 
weekend, showcasing their strength in distance 

By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

After opening the season across 
town at San Diego State, the UCSD 
track and field team returned home 
to the friendly confines of 
Triton Stadium to do battle 
with a trio of Division II 
challengers Hist weekend. 
Cal State Los Angeles, Cal 
Poly Pomona and UC Riv-
erside all paid a visit to 
lovely La Jolla, only to go 
away with a sour taste in 
their mouthes, as UCSD ran ci rcles 
around its guests. 

The "quad meet" was scored so 
as to pit each team against each 
other team. The Tritons' only loss 
was to the CSULA women, who 
edged out the UCSD women by a 
final margin of 45-42. 

Other than that , the Triton af-
ternoon was unblemished by de-
feat. Both UCSD's men and 
women destroyed Riverside, as the 
visitors from smog vi lle could not 
adjust to the clear blue skies over-
head, fa lling by score of 69-22 on 
the men' s side and 62-24 on the 
women 's. 

Poly Pomona by the narrowest of 
margins, 47-46. Meanwhile, the 
Pomona women were cru hed by 
the Triton contingent, 59-39. 

The men 's slim victory over 
Pomona was facilitated by a 
number of clutch perfor-
mances, one of which was 
turned in by 110 meter hur-
dler Tim Prudence. Accord-
ing to UCSD Head Coach 
Ted Van Arsdale, Prudence, 
who hadn ' t hurdled since 
high school , "volunteered his 

services to help the team the day 
before the meel." The sophomore 
then stepped in to notch a third-
place finish , earning an ali-impor-
tant point for his placing. 

The other key finish was in the 4 
x 400 meter relay where a strong 
third leg by Kevin Marsh brought 
the Tritons back from an early defi-
cit to take the win. The three points 
earned for first place pushed UCSD 
past Pomona in the overall stand-
ings. 

Mark Patterson/GuardIan 
The Triton men bested CSULA, 

considered a national title con-
tender, 50-47, a"d nuck past Cal 

In the field , Triton pole vault-
ers Creed Stary and David Spector 
conllnued a budding rivalry that 
will likely see the tandem atop the 
standings throughout the season. 
Both cleared 15' I" to finish 1-2,

Chapman No Match for UCSD 
STOMPING: Tritons crush Chapman, 7-0, raising their record to 2-1 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Chapman may be dubbed the 
Panthers, bUI il was UCSD which 
did all the roaring in its matchup on 

Thursday afternoon 
at the North Courts. 
Amid the din of the 
construction which 
has disrupted traffic 
around north park-
ing,lhe Tritons wcnt 
about their business 

.... .,;,;,,; ... -- unfazed,dispatching 
with the Chapman team easily, 7-
0, and dropping only two sets in the 
process. 

Number-one singles player Dan 
Brounstein struggled slightly at the 
outset of his showdown with the 
Panthers' top dog, Yutaka 
Nakamura, losing set one, 6-4. 
However, Brounstein quickly re-
gained his form , blistering 

Nakamura, 6-3, 6-3, in sets two 
and three. 

"[Brounstein] got off to a slow 
start, and his play was sloppy," 
UCSD Head Coach Brian Turner 

explained. "But after the first et, 
he tightened it up. It was never 
really in doubt that he would win 
it."
