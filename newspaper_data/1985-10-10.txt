A show of 
solidarity 

By SEAN Wt\GSTAFF 

STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS of a nature unheard of since the early 1970s swept UCSD 
and the rest of the country last 
year, calling for an end to the 
apartheid policies of South Africa. 
Those policies have been blamed 
on widespread rioting and violence 
there. 

University of California students, 
last spring, called for full university 
divestment from companies doing 
business in that country. But the 
UC Regents, in June, decided that 
divestment was not necessarily 
appropriate, and created the 
University Advisory Committee on 
Investor Responsibility (UACIR) 
instead.

In their meeting on September 
17, the Regents also approved a 
South Africa-free retirement 
portfolio for faculty and staff. 

The African National Congress 
asked that people obselVe a 
moment of silence in solidarity 
with South African political 
prisoners on Friday. Student groups 
have chosen that day to call for 
general strikes in the nation's 
universities. 

Last night, both the Associated 
Students and the Graduate Student 
Association at UCSD voted to 
suppon a campus-wide, all-day 
strike.

Kicking Back 
Buying books is like getting a phone installed - it's tOO 

much to pay, but you can't lIVe WIthout It .so you pay. 
But a year ago, Ken Appel had paid enough of the 

bookstore's high prices, and decided to do something about It. 
He called up a pubhsher to tty to get books wholesale. 

"The publisher told me the only way I could get books for 
less was to become a bookstore. So I became a bookstore ." The 
bookstore IS call1ed KB (kickback) Books 

It wasn't an easy beginning, but now It ' KB's second year at 
UCSD, ancl most of their stock was sold in the first week, Appel 
said . KB also opened another store at SDSU thiS fall which was 
"met with a lOt of enthUSiasm." 

After getting a bUSiness license and a costly resale permit , 
Appel started work In a fnend's garage They took orders b), 
phone and had to dehl'er all the books while enrolled In school 
full-time. 

Onglnally, Ken Just wanted to get lower pnced books for 
himself. "Then I figured, if I could get books for myself, I could 
get them for my friends , and my friends' frie nds " 

Ken has had a lot of support, he said , and that IS what keeps 
business going. He now has a partner, Paul MartinellI , and five 
employees to work the rwo shops 

KB Books buys used texts, sells new and used ones and takes 
orders. They operate out of a small room in the back of the 
Great Earth Vitamin store In La Jolla Village Square 

Appel's entrepreneur spmt has a hleved more results than 
JUSt cheaper books at KB , he said. "I feel that we've succeeded 
in making the untversity bookstore re-evaluate their pn Ing 
policies. "They might deny us as their reason for lowenng 
prices," Appel said , "but I don't see any other reason You can 
challenge a system and do something about it'

UREPean vacations: exotic research in wild locations 
By GAYLE HEIRSHBERG 

T HE RAIN POURED DOWN steadily on the darkening forest. The clouds that 
could be seen through the 
treetops loomed menacingly 
overhead. Nothing could be 
heard but the downpour. Activity 
was minimal in the forest as the 
inhabitantS submitted to the 
forces of nature. 

A few, however, were 
persistent enough 10 pursue their 
trek through the forest despite 
the disagreeable weather One 
woman trudged on, through the 
mud. Keeping pace with the 
troop of monkees overhead; 
SlOpping when they did , wditing, 
and then moving on when they 
chose 10 do so. 

LUCinda Rubio, an assistant 
admil1lstrator in the U SD 
hterature department was in a 
group of six that made up the 
field team of a research 
expedition headed by a 
University of California 
researcher, who, in this case, 
specialized In the study of 
primates. Rubio, who had never 
done anything like this before, 
was sponsored by the University 
Research Expeditions Program 
(UREP) 

The tcam helped the 
researcher gather information 
on a pallicular group of primates 
di rected towards speci fic aspects 
of behaviour. 

The expedition, which took 
place in a rain forest in Kenya, is 
Just one of several tripS that have 

been offered through UREP. 
UREP links inexperienced 
members of the public with UC 
researehers who are in need of 
field teams and research funding. 

Rubio's group studied the 
Interaction behaVIOur of three 
types of primates In relation 10 
ea h other and In reiallon to 
troops of primates of the same 
type but living in Uganda (which 
borders thc Kakamega forest 
where the researchers stayed). 

"After that experience, I found 
that this was the only way 10 go," 
said Rubio, "It's very di fferent 
from a vacation. The people we 
met on the trip saw us in a 
different light. The people there 
treated us differently because we 
were there working rather than 
simply taking a tour and 
observing. The people are 
interested In what you are doing. 
[ think you get 10 know the 
people and the country much 
better." 

Rubio's group stayed In a 
house of the forestry department. 
It was a wooden structure that 
offered no electricity and no hot 
water. The y slept on wooden 
beds with their sleeping bags on 
tOp. 

"It wasn 't a hardship because 
all you wanted at the end of a 
day was any place to rest your 
body. You were so tired ." 

The day began for Rubio and 
the rest of her group at about 6 
am each day. Each person was 
assigned a troop of monkees and 
they were to follow them until

nightfall (about 7 pm) The 
monkees don 't move at night so 
the researchers we re safe 10 leave 
unattended at that time , RubiO 
said. 

"[n the beginning I thou~ht I 
would be frightened . I thought 
that big animals would come and 
get me [ also thought that [ was 
going to get lost. Even though I 
know no one had ever gotten 
lost , all the paths looked alike 
and I was ~o sure I would get 
lost that [ brought a nare with 
me , In case." 

"But, on the Fourth of July, 
since we had no way to celebrate 
[ got my flare out to set off. It 
didn't even work," she said . 

According to Rebecca Simon, 
public information coordinator 
for UREP, "The program gives 
people a chance to partici pate in 
meaningful scienllfic work and 
to see things they might not 
otherwise see." 

According 10 RubiO, her trip 
was part of a cumulative stud), of 
these primates, one that had 10 be 
continuany updated . It was also 
to be part of the UC researcher's 
doclOral dissertation . 

Volunteers for these group 
expeditions have ranged from 17 
to 75 in age and have included 
individuals from a variety of 
occupations. Simon said . 

According to Rubio, her group 
conSisted of a student majonng 
in animal behaVIOur, a woman 
who wanted to see East Afnca, a 
primary schoolteacher who also 
wanted to see Africa , a Kenyan

An average expedition from

grown from three projects in 
[977 10 26 projects that were 
offered thiS summer Though 
more expeditions go OUt dUring 
the summer, a few will be offered 
In the fall and winter 

Taking one of these 
expeditions is a lot more 
interesting then a regular

has been on rwo more 
expeditions since the one to 
Kenya and plans to take another 
In the near future . "It's definitely 
worthwhile ."

In solidarity with South African prisoners 
Slavery has been fruitful in giving itself names. It has been ca lled "the 

peculiar institution," "the social system," and "the Impediment". " It has 
been called by a great many names, and it will call itself by yet another 
name; and you and I and all of us had better wait and see in what new shin 
this old snahe will come forth next. 

- Frederick Douglass 
The dogma of apartheid within South Africa's ideology of racism is 

the latest and most lu id systematic falsification of the inhumanity 
suffered by the African people at the hands of white settlers. There is 
always the temptation to lull oneself with the idea that imperial 
mystiques like apartheid will disappear by their own destructive nature , 
or will be proved economically and morally "unfeasible" by market 
forces, like slavery was in the US in the last century. However, racism in 
its 400 years of systematic propogation has become a real socio-
economic and political force with significant support from the capitalist 
seCtor. Racism is nm merely a body of ideas, nor an undesirable 
manifestation of colonialist imperialism; today it is a modem structure 
deSigned to continue the dominance of the conquerors over the 
conquered, the rich over the poor, The fanatical ideas of South African 
institutions like the Dutch Reformed Church (who have doctrinized the 
system of apartheid as the will of God) have been the expression of the 
definite political and economic interests corporatist groups for centuries, 
U.s. multinational corporations continue to rely on such groups (in the 
South African case the Afrikaner Nationalists, Boer ranchers and English 
financiers must be cited) to ensure that their policy of oppression for 
profit is furthered , The governors in South Africa perpetuate apartheid 
as their "manifest destiny" to "civilize" the "inferior" peoples of that 
region . International investors have historically propped-up regimes like 
P.W . Botha's in order to take advantage of military dominated , cheap 
labor force (see Pinochet's Chile, the Shah's Iran, Somoza's icaragua, 
and the like), Henceforth racism has become a distorted economic 
reality that is firmly entrenched in the minds of corporate owners as a 
justi fied tool of profit. 

Although we cannm hope to quickly extinguish the psychological 
resonance of racial superiority, we can strive to help dismantle the 
unequal social relations of capitalist production and exploitation that 
presently exists in South Africa, If we wish to encourage peaceful 
democracy there , we must act immediately by using the resources we 
have as US citizens, Our most powerful resource in this case is to 
protest, and protest encapsules a number of things: sending letters of 
condemnation to the South African government; sending food, money, 
pencils , paper, books, clothes, and any other item that you deem 
relevant to the oppressed people of color in the townships; calling your 
Congressperson and demanding that he or she pressure the federal 
government to impose full sanctions of South Africa; calling the White 
House and educating Ronald Reagan on the true meaning of segregation 
in Pretoria and the futility of constructive engagement; and of course, by 
going on Strike tomorrow, Friday, October 11, to show your solidarity 
with the South African prisoners by pressuring the UC Regents and the 
San Diego County Retirement Board to divest all monies that they have 
invested in companies that do business in South Africa. 

You may be tired of hearing the word "divestment" by now and 
wonder if these persistent activists ever do achieve their goal of 
obtaining moral investment codes from the UniverSity of California. In 
order that political equality may soon be realized by blacks, coloreds, 
Indians, and Asians in South Africa, viewed in a timely perspective , let 
us understand that over the past 37 years since the system of apartheid 
was formally introduced to the Afrikaner Nationalist Party by H.E 
VelWaerd, whites in South Africa have enjoyed certain opportunities for 
obtaining wealth, for exercising power and authority, and for 
successfully obtaining prestige and social differences, all as a result of

the conviction that these benefits were theirs by right - conquering 
and racial right. These exploitative advantages are thought to be by 
South African whites (progressives excluded) as normal , proper, 
sanctioned by precedent and the natural order of things. Both domestic 
and international proposals to change or destroy the existing situation 
have been reacted to with moral indignation. A former South African 
minister has said, "We know one person only to whom we owe 
explanation and that is the white worker in South Africa, who has 
brought the Nationalist Party to the position it occupies today and will 
keep it in that position in the future ." We are faced then , with a 
traditional compound of racial prejudice and explOitation, that is not 
acccessible to pleas for equality nor political threats, but is susceptible to 
international economic pressure. 

As colonial freedom has swept the African continent from north to 
south , South Africa has found itself unable to resist the winds of change, 
Because of the rising political tide of black resistance to apartheid rule , 
over 40 US businesses have divested completely already, It can and will 
be stated that political and potential economic domestic pressures 
preempted these moves in the United States (i.e., a rapid rate of 
account withdrawals from investor Bank of America by pro-divestment 
activists) , but moreover, the gradual political isolation of South Africa 
from the rest of the African continent has had a provocative effect on 
revolutionary groups like the African National Congress. 

It is no coincidence that since the culmination of the divestment 
movement last spring, the value of the rand has been devalued to a 
position of 38 cents to the dollar. Industrial investment has been 
severely curtailed as the international banking community has virtually 
shut the door on new loans to the South African government, P.W, 
Botha has moved quickly to distill western skepticism about the safety of 
maintaining an economic presence there by teUing their representatives 
that "the abolishment of petty apartheid will be enough to quell the 
masses." Nothing is more ridiculous than that, and the detainment of 
more than 5000 multiracial activists since July 1 along with the killing of 
over 700 blacks this year, belies that analysis. 

For it is time now to force the South African government into the 
final stage of demise - we can do that by letting our voices be heard 
across the world . Yelling, however, is simply not enough, Our voices 
must be full of assurances that the benefactOrs of the University of 
California will divest before the year is out, that we are in the process of 
organizing mass relief efforts for the statving in the black townships, 
and that we will do whatever we can to support the efforts of the 
African National Congress, the United Democratic Front, the Black Sash, 
the Reverend Allan Baeseak, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela 
and his family, and all other "freedom fighters" currently waging war 
agains .. oppression in South Africa, 

Tomorrow is a national day in solidarity with South African prisoners. 
What this incurs is devotion - ,devotion to democracy and justice. 
What we are discussing here is not attending your classes for one day 
out of your whole existence, These prisoners in South Africa live in 
dank, crowded , cramped, rat-infested , smelly, dim and animalistic cells, 
They do nOI go to school in La Jolla, have the opportunity to take study 
breaks under sunny blue skies, sleep with their spouses, or go to 
Roberto 's, Very few happy moments happen in the course of their days , 
with the exception of getting an extra piece of bread or being spar:!d 
from a beating. They might like it very much , though , if they heard 
somewhere through a rusty pipeline that the people of the United States 
stood up for one day and protested their government's support for the 
apartheid system. 

Act for your sisters and brothers in South Africa tomorrow. Show the 
world you abhor racism, Pick yourself up off your desk and demand 
sanctions and divestment in the name of humanity - Strike!

A second homily to young activists 
By MICHAEL ROSSMAN 
(Continued from Monday) 
Your Job As A Student 

So you work for divestment -
or 10 retain a particular 
professor, or to sever university 
suppon of military research , or 
to establish a field-s tudy course 
for credit - nm only for the 
oven goal, but 10 make the 
university a more responsive 
learning-place. You do so less for 
the general good than from 
selfish need , as a personal duty . 
For this is the environment you 
need, essential to your learning; 
this is the condition you came 
here to learn how to help create, 
in which you can have your 
rightful say in meeting needs. 

This is your proper job as a 
student, your own vital 
curriculum, though the catalogue 
doesn't lis t it and the school 
works largely to discredit it. For 
the ivory tower, the academic 
cloister distinct from society, 
dissolved long ago. The modem 
multiversity has itself become 
one of the massive 
bureaucratized systems of the 
society it prepares you for, 
renecting the d ominant forces 
directly, inculcating the 
dominating culture. Sociologists 
still talk of studenthood as a 
moratorium time, a delay of 
social adulthood; but in a deep 
sense, that's nonsense. This is it , 
kid ; you're in the thick of it 
already. Your school is a fair 
replica of institutional society; 
and your schooling is already the 
e xperience il prepares you for. 

For throughout its operations, 
your school has a shadow 
program, a meta-curriculum 
active in each panicular course, 
each transaction with the 
Registrar. Its normal processes 
teach you to divide yourself from 
OIhers through specialization and 
sub-speCializati on; to accept 
hierarchical systems of status 
and decision-making; to expect 
anc depend o n authoritative 
direction of what you should do 
and how to do it; 10 work and 
learn in mec hanized periods 
having no natural relation to 
your own needs and energies, in 
groups formed and dissolved by 
institutional processes rather 
than their own dynamics ; and so 
on . Through all this 11 teaches 
also a deeper lesson , ll f passIve 
and unconscIous adaptation 10 
the InslltUlional order itself as 
the state of nature . 

The relations and experiences 

you school yourself in now, 
prepare you for what lies ahead. 
Waiting till after you graduate to 
assume some non -passive 
relation 10 the institutions that 
serve and govern you. is like 
waiting till you get rich and 
powerful e nough to "really be 
able to do something about 
social injustice." I don't mean 
that you can't; but it's a lot 
harder to get around to doing it, 
unless you've been practicing. 

So you work for divestment, or 
whatever, and bless the 
univerSity, even as you curse its 
administration's resistance, for 
giving you the chance to 
practice . For your school's doing 
its proper job after all , in an 
ironic but recious sense , b 

beyond the stance of passive 
passage through its system. Or 
rather, this is your counte r-
schooling, the thrust of a 
different response to [he same 
circumstance . providing you with 
technical skills and more , 
res tOri ng what is withered by the 
tnslitutional process: directness 
and connenion , integrity and 
autonomr· 

Your Job Making You 
So you work for divestment, or 

for whatever else matters , 
because the work joins you With 
OIhers isolated in the 
machinery's compal1ments, cuts 
across the divisions of discipline , 
class, color, status, con nects you 
in a commu ni en a ed to ether 

democracy, makes campus 
activism sound like a boot-camp 
for professional do-gooders -
and worse , makes the impulse 
and training seem so dreadfully 
exterior. There 's Just no adequate 
language to speak o f your 
ci tizenship as If it were an 
intimate personal quality. as 
complex and tangible as you 
musculature , your emotions , your 
mind . Yet is Indeed another SOrt 
of body that you wear in the 
world from within , that develops 
through your exercise , that you 
exercise for the same reasons 
you exercise your muscles, your 
feehngs , your mind - from 
sheer existential pleasure, JUSt 
because you can; and to make 
yourself whole , healthy, capable 
to make ourself who ou can be

providing you a rich ground on 
which to learn the vi tal lessons 
that no courses cover, that 
prepare you indeed for life in 
modem SOCiety. 

Here you can learn how to 
fi nd and share resources ir. the 
institutional wilderness. Here you 
can learn how to deal with 
bureaucratic systems for your 
needs and rights, and to 
preserve your sense of self in the 
dealing. Here you can learn how 
10 make your personal imprint 
on the impersonal: how to deal 
off with authorities to get your 
own patch of turf on which 10 
exercise self-direction ; how to 
work alone and with Others to 
affect the processes and decisons 
that affect you; and how to 
c hange the whole for the better, 
or at least 10 try . 

This IS some of the learntng 
your school offers. once you step 

in coming 10 grips wuh what 
matters 10 aU. You do it to help 
call this community into being; 
you do it 10 help call yourself 
into being, to learn who you can 
be and what you can do in this 
conncetion . 

You get involved not only to 
help make this inslitution 
respond , but to make yourself a 
person who responds , a per on 
who can help make social 
machinery responsive. For you 
are the most precious product of 
your action , as important as the 
community it e ngenders and the 
end it achieves Your own 
learning, your own growth , are 
your action 's gift to the future -
to your future , ..tnd to ours , for 
you need 10 know your potency 
as a citlzen, and we need you to 
know, too. 

To say that you get Involved to 
prepare yoursrIf .IS <In "gent of 

for the long run; and also, of 
course , because you must for 
your ci lizenship obeys (he same 
stem law as your strength , your 
compassion, your analytiC power: 
Use it or lose It. 

All thiS is reason enough to 
work for divestment o~ whatever. 
But beyond this, as a student, as 
a leamer, you have special reason 
to "become a social activist. " You 
do it [0 learn In practice a 
different set of lessons about 
learning itself, than your school 
teaches you; and to become a 
different SOI1 of learner. For this 
stud y IS you r own choice, 
unaSSigned. It offers you the 
chance 10 choose nOt only the 
subject but how to approach it. 
what resources 10 use , wwhat 
informallon to seek; to choose 
who you learn with and who you 
learn from; and 10 follow the 
learning wherever It ma), lead . It 

InVlleS you to learn how to form 
your own view among confli cting 
evidences; and requires that you 
be your own Judge of the 
learning and consequence, 
though not alone and with 
history's aid . 

In such ways and more , your 
actiVIsm can be a specific 
antidote, or at least a healing 
balance, to the lessons of 
institulional studenthood . For 
these are the habits and 
capacities of a self-directed 
leamer, that prepare you as a 
free and pmem ci tizen of a 

.. commu nity of learning, and of a 
democratic society - and 
prepare you, quite mundanely , 
for most of the learning you'll be 
faced with for the rest of your 
life , at least outSide your job. 

Of course it's easy enough to 
fail this CUrriculum even while 
working for the good , by 
recreating in your activism the 
same habits of authOrity-centered 
learning that the Institution 
teaches, depending on 
authoritative figures to define 
what's important and how to 
approach it. 10 assign your roles 
and judge your performance, and 
so on. There's no chann against 
thiS , but only your clarity and 
will 10 persist In becoming your 
own person. with me help of 
your frie nds. 

So you work for divestment or 
whatever. and try to make the 
work reOect your goals. You try 
to make the group, the action , 
the movement embody equity 
and mutual care; you work to 
have your rightful say within it 
as well as through it, and 10 
make it responsive 10 all. So 
simple to pose , Ihis curriculum 
of democracry; you could spend 
a lifetimeleaming how; might as 
well keep on getting started now. 

Good Luck 
All this may seem a bit much 

10 hang on the slender, hesitant 
thread of your early 
participation. FollOWing the 
news, listening at the noon 
ra)lies, a few talks with friends , a 
book looked 1nlO , JOining a 
march across campus - II 
doesn't amount 10 much yet, 
hardly enough to trouble your 
studies. Yet these are Ihe Issues , 
the stakes , thaI even your most 
tentative partlcipatlon Involves, 
the e are the social and person:!1 
pmenllals that resonate In your 
Simplest action. Invillng you to 
explore and reahze them further.

Misinfonned terrorism 
Editor: 

Re: D. Richard 's article 
"Terrorism - Part I" 

For a JournalIst (is that what 
you call yourself, David Richard?) 
to analyze a multi-faceted subject 

like terron m In such a simple-
minded manner, is 
unprofes IOnal and unethical. BUI 
for a Journalist to be so blatanti)' 
mlsInfonned (or mismfonnative), 
IS unforgl\ 'able. 

The "defunct .[ upamaros of 
Uruguay" (defunct meamng dead 
and murdered , but not extinct), 
you say, were fana tic nationalists. 
Actually, about 15 years ago, a 
group of Uruguayan reSidents -
idealisltic , Intelligent and mostly 
fed up With mJustice and 
orruptlon - organized to 

confront their pollflcal system 
whic h WclS slowly chokmg Itself 
Let's not go IntO why thiS rather 
loose set of concerned citizens 
and reSidents eventually became 
a ughter, diSCiplIned, anned core 
- the Tupamaros - with a 
surrounding mass of supporting 
Civilians (and qUite a few 
members of the Original anny as 
well ). Let's not analyze the 
sour es of the force that 
squashed this. group and the 
Uruguayan population in general. 
Let's not try to decide right now 
what really constitutes terrorism 
(perhaps not torture; curfews; 
censorship; the suspension of 
one of the world's most 
progressive constitutions; 
bookburning; "therapeutic" 
detentions featuring rapes , 
broken limbs, burst lungs, 
destroyed genitals , broke n jaws, 
kicked fetuses?). But, for the sake 
of accuracy and fairness, let's 
make It clear that the Tupamaro 
movement had nothing to do 
with nationalistic fanatiCism. The 
issue was never to separate the 
population but to bring it 

together; and most definitely 
their actions did not respond to 
any religious, ethnic, moral or 
cultural allegiance of any kind . 

My suggestion , David Richard : 
read , listen, ask , think and think 
again before you write. You arc 
fortu nate to write 111 a

Scientific Fraud 
Editor: 

Rachel Freifelder's article on 
the sciemifi fraud perpetuated 
by Dr. Slutsky points out starkly 
the dark side of American 
medical re earch . 

Few people realize that $ 7 
billion IS spent each year on 
medical researc h; $4 billion of 
this is taxpayers' money. In 
1984, UCSD received $41.6 
million from the National 
Institutes of Health alone, to 
conduct medical research . This 
money is doled out as grants to 
mdividual researchers and their 
projects. About 70 percent pays 
the researchers' salaries, the rest 
goes for equipment and supplies. 

Obtaining these grants is a 

competltlve process. The 
"publish or perish" syndrome has 
a large part in this, a good part 
of the peer review that takes 
place focuses on how many 
papers a grant applicant has 
published , not necessarily how 
good they are . Academic 
promOtion depends on 
paperwork produced , as well. As 
Dr. Roben Petersdorf, UCSD 

dean of medicine commented, 
"Academic promotion 
co mmittees count and weigh 
papers, they do not read them." 

The pressure on quantity 
rather than quality leads to 
stupid research as well . Here at 
UCSD, researchers are 
detennining the pulmonary 
capabilities of seals by forci ng 
them underwater; they are 
detennining differences in 
temperature regulation in pigs 
reared in wann or cold 
enVironments, with or without 
skin denervation; and they are 
studying the sense of smell in 
garter snakes. 

Less than 3 percent of research 
money goes toward prevention, 
al though many major killers -
heart disease, starvation, cancer, 
stroke - are in many ways 
preventable. Think what $7 
billion could do for ghetto 
children or the starving in 
Ethiopia. Reducing smoking, 
alcohol consumption, saturated 
fat intake and exposure to 
noxious chemicals while 
increasing fiber intake , exercise 
and responsibility for ene's own 
well-being will surely save more 
people than a study of the gas 
exchange capabilities of the 
harbor seal. But which is unique, 
new and publishable? And which 
is more likely to get federal 
funding? Cheating seems a small 
price to pay to ensure that the 
tax dollars keep flowing in and 
that research papers are 
accepted for publication,

committee recommendation , by 
suggestions from Scri pps faculty, 
and from general public 
recommendations. 

According to Dr. Munk, head 
of the selection committee, the 
eighth director of Scripps must 
possess foremost a re a "romantic 
love for the ocean," in addition 
to academic qualifica tions, strong 
leadership, administrative 
experience and national and 
international prestige . "We are 
not looking for a money-raiser," 
says Munk. Scripps is funded 
through the Office of Naval 
Researc h and the Na tional 
Science Foundarion. 

Another expectation of Munk 
and the Committee is that "after 
all these years, it might be good 
to go back to having a marine 
biologist as director. Our past 
direclOrs have been phYSical 
oceanographers and 
geophysicists. But that is not 
going to dictate our choice .... We 
will choose who we think is the 
best ( person)." 

UCSD Chance llor Richard 
Atkmson will make the final 
appOi ntment , based on the 
recommendations of the 
committee, SIO's director works 
closely with UCSD's chancellor 
as well as vice chancellor of 
marine affairs. He or she also 
holds a professorship in a UCSD 
department. 

The first director of Scripps 
William Ritter, a professor of 
zoology at Berkeley in 1903 , 
originated the idea-of Scripps as 
a base for his students' summer 
marIne biology expeditions. 

Sc ripps evolved into a global 
research and expeditIon 
Institution under Roger Revelle , 
one of the founders of UCSD, 
who proclaimed "The Pacific is 
our oyster." He acquired five 
ships which helped SCrippS 
launch the Deep Sea Drilling 
Project wh ic h lasted 21 years, 
culminating last year. The project 
charted the ocean's depths and 
took core samples that have 
helped explaIn the earth's 
evolution. 

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography'S staff passed a 
resolutIon Apnl 30 which they 
presented to iercnberg. It reads, 
"We the faculty of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography Wish

as director there have been 
major initiatives, includ ing the

program, the remote-sensing 
facility and the acquisition of 
computing capabili ty in the fleet.

Alumni recommend practical experience 
By KAREN KAWASAKI 

Although UC D alumni seem 
grateful for the academically 
competitive atmosphere at the 
umversuy, many re ommend that 
students acquire Job-related 
practical expenence outside the 
classroom 

Janet Mlka, a member of the 
UCSD's first graduating class In 
1968, remembers the students 
on-campus as bemg "very 
selective and real competitive . It 
was excuing to be a pan of the 
first graduating class We (the 
182 Revelle students) were 
mostly concerned With getting 
thmgs staned . A lot found It was 
too ngorous or tOO isolated (from 
an Diego)." 

Mika, however. surVived and 
earned a bachelor's degree 10 

earch Club, a workshop enmled 
"Fmding the Hidden Job 
Market ." a career on~ultants file 
and an Internshtp program 

Dorseyempha Ize that " It' 
never toO late to start. Of all the 
possible thIngs you could do 
during your academiC career 
practlcal experience IS the most 
important factor m addition to 
getting a degree from a highly 
prestigious univerSity like 
UCSD " 

Michelle Gross, a 1981 
graduate of Revelle who is now 
pursuing a graduate degree m 
hnguistlcs at UCSD. also explams 
the Importan e of practical 
expenence' "In college , you know

you're workIng, your bo s doesn 't

mathematics She adds, "I hke 
the way it's structured now I see 
what's gOIng on out there - It'S 
a very Viable campus and It 
keeps wInning lots of awards 
whtle II IS sull developing." 

Mlka knows much about 
gemng things estabhshed and 
watchtng them grow She I ~ 
curre ntly dlstnhutlve systems 
director for Reymark Systems, a 
software developer Mlka 
explams "As part of a small 
compan}', I get to do a Illtle of 
everything. from programming to 
busi ness managemenl And I 
enJoy watc hing a small husmess 
grow and develop " 

However, Anne Dorsey, career 
Information speclaltst at UCSD's 
Career Services Ce nter. POIntS 
out that "of all the factors that 
could conceivably correlate 
positively to success in the job 
market, only one conSistently 
does so - and that's career-
related practical expenence 

"Those Wlth experience did 
better than everyone else on 
every measure. More were 
employed at a higher rate, more 
of them are employed full-time, 
more of them got jobs related to 
their education, and more of 
them got jobs that had career 
potential." 

To help graduating seniors 
gain contacts in the business 
world, the Career Services Center 
offers a variety of programs. 
Some of these include: the 
mentor program (which pairs the 
student up Wlth someone in hiS 
field), the on-campus 
intervirwing program, the Job 

tell you at the 'end 01 five weeks, 
I want you to know how thiS 
operating system works, here 's a 
book so stud y from II ." 

Two or three weeks afte r 
fi nishmg her undergraduate 
major m computer 
sclence/ hngulsllcS, Gross started 
her first Joh working for Texas 
Instruments 

That (moving to HoustOn 
Tex 1 was more of an adjustment 
than ..Invthlng else When you 
move to a Cit}' and you're pan of

experience than gomg awa}' to

to school and helps }'OU tntegra te

"You shouldn't thmk of college 
as Just relatlng to majors and 
getting a Job. A lot of II IS 
growmg up and learning to take 
responsibility lor domg things on 
your own ," Gross said 

Martinez also stresses the need 
for acting responsibly. He states, 
"You don't need to get Involved 
Just in academics. A student 
needs to be a responSible leader 
and be prepared to articulate a 
position . That should not be 
ignored ." 

Mika also commented about 
becoming tOO involved in college 
academics. "UCSD prepares just 
about anybody perfecdy weD for 
graduate school, but not for the 
'real world,' there are not enough 
practical business and 
management type classes." 

Marttn Lopez, a 1984 Revelle 
graduate , echoed Mika's last 
statement about prepar.ltion. 

Now a sound techniCIan for CB 
News, he remembers, "By no 
means did UC D prepare me 
well - It wa clearly by my ol,vn 
personal pursuance. hke working 
outSide of class for two hours, 
that I became preparcd. Lots of 
people coast through school, and 
they get good jobs, but not the 
real good Jobs " 

"Workmg for CB has opened 
up new opportunities for Lopez 
who is now beginnmg work on 
two low budget feature films (on 
one as an associate produ er) 
out of Los Angeles. He would 
someday. however. like to create 
films and other pieces based on 
hiS own ideas. 

"Lookmg back on the 
truggles, college really wa n't 

tha t hard It wa~ nerve rackmg, 
but It was not hke bangIng your 
head agamsl a bnck wall . Eve n a 
bnck wall has lots of cracks," 
Lopez states. 

In fact. some of the most 
enjoyable experiences for him 
were "having to stay up twO to 
three nights and three to four 
days at school just to finish a 
film project. All of my friends 
and [ would stay up together and 
send out for pizza." The 
camaradene and social livelihood 
the alumni gained from UCSD 
werc the qualities most well 
thought of on this campus 

M<irtin Standler, a 1980 Muir 
graduate, remeltlbers that 
although "the first year of college 
was pretty miserable, the attntion 
rate was about 70 percent. After 
the first year. you found lots of 
thmgs you Itked." 

He continues, "I enjoyed 
meeting people when I was on-
campus and the one thing I 
enjoyed the most was my 
involvement in the PE 
department. I spent a lot of Bme 

there and wa on the 
intercollegiate badminton team. It 
(PE) was a good outlet." 

The awve hfe he led whtle 
pursuing hiS bachelor's degree In 
economl s has developed IntO 
his ownership of a tenms shop 
In La Jolla , The Racket StringIng 
Workshop. 

"I wanted to do something 
before I went to graduate school. 
so I went ahead and boupht the 
shop (in 1980) .... 1 am st;!1 
learning even though 1 am not in 
school, but it's more along the 
hnes of studying about people ," 
he explains. 

One alumna who specializes 
in studying people is Jennifer 
Hurlow Paonessa, a 1979 Third 
College graduate . Paonessa 
earned her bachelor's degree in 
communications/ sociology and 
later earned a masters in SOCial 
work from San Diego tate 
University 

In her current Job , Paonessa is 
the director of the Adult Day 
Health Care Center in San Diego. 
She explains that from the center 
she gains "mu h satisfaction in 
knOWing that we ( the enter) 
provide an important service to 
the community." 

Like Standler, she enjoyed the 
social atmosphere while at 
UCSD: "I enjoyed [he social and 
intellectual stimulation among 
peers - it was a learning and 
growing process." 

In a different sense , Dav:d 
Bnn, a graduate student who 
earned hiS Ph D 10 electrical 
engineering and computer 
cience (EECS) and space 

science in 198 I , also provides an 
Important service to not one , but 
all communities. Brin, a noted 
science fiction writer, has' 
authored four novels and has 
won several Hugo Awards (an 
international science fiction 
award) and a Nebulla Award 
(also a world wide honor). 

Hi s newest novel and first 
major hard cover, The Postman, a 
cautionary tale about hope and 
perserverence after a nuclear war, 
is due to be released this week 
He has already had ~rious offers 
to make (he novel into a movie. 

He does not, however, let all 
the fame affect him. "You can be 
a famous author and still have 
privacy. [ do love to speak at 
science fiction conventions 
though . You have to be an 
Asimov or a Stephen King before 
people recognize you," he 
observes. 

Bnn continues, "For me, 
writlng is easy. I love writing. but 
I stlll keep a hand In science. 
Science is the adventure of thiS 
century. Almost every American 
knows morr about science than 
he ~r he gives themselves credit 
for. 

Despite hiS high regard for 
SCience, Bnn stresses the 
Importance of a diverse 
educational background. He notes 
that the University'S wide variety 
of intra-departmental seminars 
expose students to fields of 
knowledge not necessarily related 
to their major and in tum 
broadens their horizens. 

Tom Steinke, a 1984 Warren 
graduate with a bioengineering! 
applied science degree, 
rehes heavily on his tech-
nical knowledge every day. 
teinke is currently a biomedical 

engineer assisting surgeons m 
designing and developlllg 
surgical deVices 

Having "crUised through 
school ," he hopes someday to 
have a busmess of his own. "I 
had real good times SOCially at 
UCSD. But academically, I think 
the broad background helped the 
most ," he comments. 

Ellen Noonan , a 1980 Muir 
graduate with a degree in 
communications/ sociology, notes 
that UCSD gave her a "good 
foundation, but not In terms of 
application ,n the job market." 
After graduating from UCSD, 

~ 
'" 
.;; 

! , 
Noonan decided to pursue a 
masters degree In mass 
communications, a degree she 
now employs. She is currently 
the director of community 
programming for Times Mirror 
Cable Television. 

"This field !S still fairly new 
and there are opportunities for 
advancement available," she 
explains. 

Many alumni have taken 
advantage of different 
opportunities and advancements. 
Many, however, do not stick to 
the fields related to thei r majors. 
According to a recent survey, by 
the Alumni Association, 69 
percent of UCSD alumni get jobs 
related to their majors - a 
higher percentage than those 
alumni from UC Irvine, Riverside 
and Santa Barbara. 

Also in the survey, alumni 
rated the quahty of their 
education. Sixty-five percent 
rated it as excellent, 32 percent 
said it was satisfactory, and only 
3 percent rdtcd It as less than 
satisfactory. IJ::I

Origins of apartheid 
By ED SWAIN 

The following IS conclusion oj a 
two-part essay which began in the 
Ocr . 7 ISsue of The Guardian. 

Since 1948, laws designed to 
suppOrt the policy of Apartheid 
mclude: the Prohibitlon of Mixed 
Marriages Act of 1949; the 
Immorality Amendment Act of 
1950 which forbade sexual 
relation between whites and 
non-whites; the Population 
Registration Act of 1950 which 
required all South Afncans to 
carry registration cards 
indicating their race; the Group 
Areas Act of 1950 which 
provided for residential division 
of all races (officially classified 
White, Coloured (mixed), Indian 
and BlaSk); the 1953 Reservation 
of Separate Amenities Act which 
made segregation compulsory in 
all public areas; the Resettlement 
of Natives Act of 1954 which 
sought to move back squatters 
away from white residential 
areas; and the eparate 
Umversities Act of 1959 which 
ehminated the "open" 
universities that allowed blacks 
entran ce. 

Severe poltce repressIOn 
reqUired a total reorgan Ization of 
the black political opposition . 
The ANC still advocated non-

violent means, and held a strike 
In May 1961. The government 
refused to bend, the strike was 
not comprehenSive enough, and 
a new, more militant 
organization - Umkonto we 
Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) was 
formed under Nelson Mandela. 
ThiS organization first began to 
use sabotage on un-manned 
facilities as a means of 
opposition so there would be no 
casua Iti es. 

The Pan African Congress 
(PAC) founded a new militant 
wing as well, called the Pogo 
(We go it alone), which was 
willing to kill police and even 
black "collaborators." The ANC 
and the PAC went abroad to 
form organizations in exile -
the first under Oliver Tambo and 
the second under Potlako 
LebaUo. These have sought to 
isola te South Africa 
diplomatically. 

Rural discontent. and most of 
all, urban black rioting, became 
endemic in the late 50s and 
early 60s, culminating in the 
SharpevIUe massacre of 1960, 10 
which blacks refusing to use pass 
books were fired upon by riOt 
police. Severe repression 
following this inCident managed 
to curb black anti-apartheid 
activities, but dISCOntent 

remained and swelled. 
In 1976, thiS discontent Oared 

up again in the most severe 
strike ever experienced in South 
Africa. In this year the South 
African police shot black 
protestors in Soweto, and violent 
rioting followed, resulting in 
hundreds of deaths and great 
destruction 

In 1978, Prime Mimster 
Vorster reured from office m 
favor of Pieter Botha. who had 
been defense mInister for several 
years, and who had preSided 
over massive build-ups of the 
South Afncan military. He, along 
with General Magnus Malan , 
engineered the ''Total Strategy," 
which takes into account 
political, social and economic 
forces , as well as mihtary, to 
maintain the South African 
regime . Pan of the "Total 
Strategy," includes taking a 
"verligte" approach. or an 
"enlightened" and tolerant 
attltude toward racial change to 
placate blacks and maintaIn 
friends internationally 

In May of 1979 Botha passed 
labor legislation favonng many 
Improvements m the conditions 
of blacks. The limits on the 
employment of particular races, 
unequal pay for equal work, 
lower unemployment benefits for

blacks, the ban on black unions 
and the restrictions on the 
acquisition by blacks were all 
eliminated and identical public 
facilities for blacks as well as 
whites were permitted. However, 
in the mming industry. where 
whites earn more than five times 
as much as blacks and racial 
conditions are at their worst , 
none of this applied; and many 
of these conditions could only 
occur through a negotiated 
setdement with factory owners or 
the compliance of white factories 
- neither of which were 
extremely likely. Further reforms 
relating to the pass system were 
lifted in the same month , but the 
pass system preventing blacks 
from freely emigrating into the 
cities was not removed 

Events in late 1980 and early 
1981 made a drastic change , 
however, m Botha's reform 
program. In the first place, 
conservatives and liberals to the 
left of Botha's National Party 
seemed to be .gaining popularity. 
More important, and probably at 
the central ca use of the latte r 
change, was the rising of black 
violen e and sabotage . 

On June I. two majOr 
refinenes, from which South 
Africa gets its scarce Oil supply, 
were bombed . More ommously, 
the Afncan atlonal Congress. 
for the first time m ItS 70-year 
hiStory, claimed responsibility. 

In 1982 the Reagan 
administration formalized poltey 
of "construcuve engagement," 
based on the concept that cruCial 
South Afncan minerals and outh 
Africa's strategiC posiuon on the 
up of Africa, made It necessary 

Thursday, Octo/l(r 10, 1985 9 
FEATURES 

to cooperate with the IcgiIlU::. In 
addition, the Reagan 
administration saw the presence 
of Cuban troops in communist 
Angola and Soviet military aid to 
guerilla insurgency groups in the 
area as major threats to American 
interests in Southern Africa, and 
believed that cooperation with 
the regime and a more helpful 
approach toward the South 
African military build-up could 
protect those I nterests. The 
adminIstration justified thiS 
stance on the grounds that 
cooperation with South Africa 
would stimulate reforms 

The only major reform 
insututed by the South African 
government since 1980, a 
proposal to give the vote to 
Asians and coloureds (although 
the white parliament could veto 
their collective deciSIOns). was 
unsuccessful 10 getting support 
even 10 the Asian and coloured 
community. 

In 1985 unrest continued to 
escalate . On Apnl 19, Prime 
Mimster Botha told Parliament 
that there had been a "drastic 
escalation of revolutionary 
climat'! In the country." He 
offered to negotiate With black 
leaders and removed the 
restrictions agamst the 
ownership of property In white 
areas for some blacks. Minor 
reforms such as these . however, 
have not served to placate 
blacks . but have merely caused 
their expectations to nse and 
have convinced them of the 
value of violence in producing a 
response from the 
government.

One of those weeks 
By PHIL LAUDER 

I rs BEEN ONE OF THOSE WEEK . You know the kllld I'm talklllg about. One of those weeks, the kind you 
remember at the end of the quarter: 
"Yeah . I knew if I survived that week . I 
could cruise the rest of the way. But my 
God . thar was some week , I tell you ." 

ThiS has been one of those weeks for 
me . I know it's only the second week of 
the quarter, and usually the se ond 
week isn 't one of thOle weeks for anyone 
- midterms don 't roll around for a 
while yet, and although you arc indeed 
behind III school already. rhere's still 
hope . Only those weeks when you really 
srart realizing that there's no chance lrihell 
of passing phYSics rum Into those weeks. 

Usually. For me, this week IS an 
exccpllon. Scholasllcally, I'm not doing 
tOO bad - except that I have a 
computer assignment due at the end of 
this week rhat I have yet to start on. 
Anyone who's had a programming class 
can tell you that a program assignment 
due date looms over you like the 
biggest, darkest, ugliest thunderhead 
you've ever seen. Just as one lightning 
bolt can ruin your whole day, one 
computer assignment can ruin your 
whole life; failure blows any chance you 
had to get a job, to have a decent 
li festyle . to marry and have kids and get 
a house in rhe suburbs and watch 

f~tbaU on Sunday afternoons. 
Everything rides on this aSSignment. 
And that is precisely why I've waited to 
the last couple days to start on it. Again . 

On top of the computer aSSignment 
lies my job, which while not crazy, is 
just time consuming enough to make me 

antsy. Also, I have to fill out my paperwork 
to get dinero at the next pay period; other-
wise I won't eat for a month . Plus there's 
homework in my other classes , plus there 's 
wntIng this column, plus there's buying 
toilet paper for home so that I Can maintain 
some level of respectability, plus, plus. plus. 

And so a feehng SCts in , call It panic 
If you Will, call It somerhlllg else if you 
won·t. It starts in your gUt somewherc 
above the pancreas. and qUickly spreads 
through your intestines and into your 
blood stream until it engulfs you' 
"aaaaMAAHHHH!! " Once engulfed , you 
ee every Illtle situallon as desperate. If 

in the morning your roommate tells you 
you put water in the coffee machine 
and turned it on but forgot to plug 11 In , 
you'll 10 e it then and there and start 
going off on how you can't take thiS any 
more, thar first there's your computer 
aSSignment and then they're making you 
work too many hours at the Caf and 
your boss is a witch and you won't get 
paid on time and meanwhile you've got 
450 pages to read in history for a take-
home next Wednesday and now the 
cofTee pot isn 't plugged in and what else 
is there and why doesn't someone just 
crash into your car and ].JUt you in the 
hospital? • 

That'll teach your roommate to rag all 
over you. 

I don't know what the remedy is for 
these kind of weeks. Positive attitude , 
looki ng to the future and knowing it 's 
going to improve, keeping a stilT upper 
lip, blah blah blah. Or maybe keeping 
the damn coffee pot plugged in . You tell 
me. I'm going to the computer lab. ~ 

BUD LIGHT 
SEPTEMBER 

Athlete of the Month 

Scott Strommer 
Men's Soccer 
5-11 1601bs. 
Junior, Halfback 
Pleasanton, Ca. 
Third College 
Biochemistry major 

"His attacking flair has made the team harder to shut down," said 
soccer coach Derek Armstrong in reference to Triton halfback Scott 
Strommer's soccer prowess , So hard to shut down, in fact, that the 
Tritons are currently ranked #3 in the nation in NCAA Division III 
competition, sporting an 11-0 record for the month of September 
and a 14-0 overall shutout record . 

Greatly contributing to the Tritons' steamrolling season is junior 
Scott Strommer, who is now in his third year asa Triton kicker and is 
well on his way to his best season performance yet. Posting four goals 
and six assists thus far this season, Strom mer is the team leader in 
assists and is third on the team in overall points. Voted MVP in the 
recent USIU Tournament, Strommer's outstanding play was a key 
component in the Tritons' defeat of Division I USIU and St. Mary's. 

"His leadership qualities are shown mainly by his example on the 
field, " said coach Armstrong about his 5-11, 160 pound sterling 
halfback who becomes the first recipient of the 1985-86 season's 
Bud Light Athlete of the Month for September. Other nominees for 
the September honor included Stacy Simmon of women's soccer 
and Duncan Millar of the men's water polo team, both of whom are 
outstanding contributors to their . respective teams.

The Tritons went to the Nor-Cal Toumey and mumed with three more losses. 

Polo-men go on road, 
leave game at home 
By DAVID TEDROW 

T HE MAIN goal for the Triton water polo team over the past few years has 
been to do well enough 
during the season to 
receive an invitation to 
the DivIsion I National 
ChampIOnship Tournament. 
To do this , the Tritons 
must schedule games against 
divlSion I powerhouses such 
as UCLA, Stanford and 
UCI, as well as play In 
tournaments in which nationally 
ranked schools compete. ThiS 
past weekend was no exception 
as the Tmons played UCLA on 
Thursday, and then travelled to 
Berkeley to play In the or-Cal 
tOurney which Included Stanford 
and UCSB The Tmons 
squafldered a golden opportunity 
to get rd nked 10 the top 10 by 
only wmnmg one of their live 
games. 

The team lo~t 10 Los Angeles 
Thursday afternoon to UCLA 
(ranked 2nd In the nallon ), 15-8 
The Tritons have lmle chance 
agamst tearns With extensive 
water polo progams hke the 
Bruins, but they never back away 
from the challenge. The team has 
played UClA three times thiS 
season without really commg 
close to beating them. "We 
schedule these teams In order to 
get to the championship 
tournament," explains the goalie 
Duncan MilJar, "We need to beat 
one of the tOp teams In the 
nation . We haven't beaten UCLA 
this year, but In past years we 
have come very close to beating 
UCI and USC, and we were tlcd 
with Stan ford at the half lasl 
year. Except for UCLA , we 
usually play the top teams tough , 
and hopefully we'll upset one of 
them soon ." Although the Tmons 
are apparently nOt In the same 
class as the chtc teams, Other 
teams ranked in the tOP 10 are 
well within UCSD's grasp Thcse 
are the teams the Tmons feel 

they can and must beat to reach 
the championship tOurney. This 
is why the or-Cal tournament 
Was so disappointing. 

The team started thc 
tournamcnt in good fashion 
Friday morning by defeating Air 
Force 9-7 in a gamc that wasn't 
as close as the score indicates. 
The momentum from this 
morning's victory didn't carry 
over mto the afternoon however, 
as the team was crushed by 
UCSB 12 to 2. In this game, 
Santa Barbara repeatedly 
capitahzed on the Tnton 's 
inabili ty to get the ball into thm 
two-meter man. Instead , UCSD's 
outSide men continually made 
poor passes mto the Inlddle 
which were stolen and qUlckl}' 
turned Into counteranack goals 
by UC B. ThiS wo uld be 
ilnalagous to the wkers being 
unable to get the ball IntO 
Kareem, and haVi ng all their 
passc~ stolen and turned mto 
faslbreak basket~ Although the 
Tmons played poorly, Coach 
Denny Harper felt that "Santa 
Barbara wasJla)'lng well enough 
that weeken to defeat the 
nation's tOP ranked teams." 

On Saturday the 
disap'polntment was even greater 
for the Tmons as they lost to 
Loyola-Chicago, a team they had 
beaten earlier in the year. UCSD 
didn't seem to begin the day 
until the fourth quarter of th is 
game, but by then they were 
trading 7-11. In the 4th period , 
the T rttons played well and were 
able to come to Within one goal 
of Loyola The team could n'l lie 
up the game, however, as a shot 
by Jeff Smith hit the goal bar and 
another UCSD shot missed ItS 
mark The Tmons stopped a 
final assault on their goal by 
Loyola and had anothcr 
opportunity to score but were 
whistled for a penalty, which 
they felt was a homble call . 

In the Truon's last game of the 

tourney, they played 11 th ranked 
Univesity of Pacific . UCSD 
played well until the fourth 
quarter when they turned the ball 
over three consecutive times. 
Each of these critical turnovers 
led to the goals by UOP and 
gave them a 6-3 lead with only a 
minute and a half left in the 
game. UCSD didn't give up 
however, and they were able to 
bring the score to 6-5 behind 
twO goals by Tom Moore. l'his 
was as close as the Tritons would 
come, however, UOP was able to 
run out the remainder of the 
clock 

The losses to UOP and Loyola-
Chicago were disappOinting fo r 
several reasons. The TTitons were 
favored over the tWO teams hut 
they lo<;t both games becau r 
they didn 't play up to thw own 
potential. In both games . Tnton 
bids to tiC the game were 
stopped , not by the OppOS ItiOn, 
but by questionable calls by the 
refe ree (the same referee In both 
games) Most Significantly, 
Victories over both these teams 
would have placed the Tritons in 
the top 10 among the nation's 
teams - a critical step if the 
team hopes to reach its goal of 
becoming the first Division III 
team to play in the division I 
championship tournament. 

The team next plays at home 
tffis Saturday against Occidental. 
The game is at Canyonvlew pool 
at 11 am. Due to the fact that 
Cal Stare Fullerton has dropped 
out , the "Truon Tournament" 
scheduled for tl1IS weekend IS 
now JUSt the name of their match 
against OCCidental The team 
also plays Sunday in Newport 
Beach agamst the United States 
National Team. These ex-
Olympians and mIlk commerCial 
actors are one of the best team~ 
m the world , if not the best. 
They will givc the Tritons a good 
challenge ~ 

Men's Basketball 
gets "flexible" 
By MATI lAIT 

T HE UCSD basketball team has traded in their' high-rops for running shoes. 
They won't be found in the gym 
practicing jump shots or lay-ups 
either, but running bleachers, 
dancing aerobics , and jogging 
distances of three, six, 
jometimes even nine miles 
instead. What is'going on here'? 
The answer to this , coach Tom 
Marshall said, will be apparent at 
their opener November 16, when 
the TritOns reveal "a faster, 
qutcker, and more exciting team 
than ever before." 

"Last year," said Marshall , "we 
were bigger and stronger and ran 
a pro-set offense . ThiS year we're 
quicker With more speed and 
agiliry so we're going with the 
'flex offense'. The ' flex' is the 
'new offense' which most reams 
u e throughout the nation." 
Coach Marshall picked up this 
new strategy by working With 
Jack Ramsey, coach of the 
Portland Trailblazers and # 1 
proponent of the running style 
offense named the "flex." In the 
flex consrant motion without the 
ball is the key. 

The change in offense was 
made to accommodate the new 
talent the tcam received this 
year. "We had a good recruiting 
year." said Marshall , "we have 
three junior college rransfers -
Dan Pino from Serra, Jim Smith 
from Fullerton , and Brian 
Back;:ns out of Cuesta - Thor 
Kekker, a senior out of Texas 
A&I , was also acquired." Dekker. 
is the only senior on the junior-
filled team. 

Marshall seemed very 
Impressed with the freshman 
crop this year and "cxpects at 
least three of them to contribute 
a lot." 

In addition to the new 
recruitS, the Tritons will rely 
heavily on returner Steve 
Dabasinskas, Mike Alvarado, 

r 

Andy Jedynak (last year's most 
improved player), and starters 
Bill Reese and Greg Kamansky. 

"The talent and enthusiasm of 
the players is so evenly spread ," 
Marshall said, "that even the 
returners will have to fight for a 
position on the team." The 
Tritions carry 15 players and 
four redshirts. According to the 
coach , "Redshil1ing is a common 
process now and gives some 
players a chance to mature ." 

The schedule for the Tritons 
this year appears to be easier 
than last season's despite 
matches against Pac-1O teams 
Berkeley and tanford. Coach 
Marshall expects "the wonl lost 
record to be better than last 
year's." He was quick to add 
however, that "this doesn't mean 
it won't be tough ." 

The coaching staff is very 
excited about the upcoming 
season. The staff is comprised of 
assistant coaches Jeff Armstrong, 
who was once with the Harlem 
Globetrotters organization, 
playing in exhibition games (all 
of which he lost); Jack Shawcroft, 
UCSD's first men's basketball 
coach in 1964-65; and Mark 
Aumann, a graduate of UCSD 
now in his first year as an 
assistant. They all feel as head 
coach Marshall does, that the 
staff is "an excellent 
combination, and each of us has 
his own contributing strengths." 

Although the team has been 
conditioning for two weeks, the 
practices are labeled unofficial 
and are said to be open to 
anyone, due to NCAA rules. The 
first official practice is midnight 
October 15. You can be sure that 
when the clock strikes 12 thar 
night, all the TritOns WIll have 
put away their jogging shoes and 
will have their high -tops on, 
ready to run, Jump, shoot and 
crash the boards. 

UrSD will unveil a new offense thIS season. 

Summer surf saga 

All over La Jolla 
and Costa Rica, too 
By JOHN SCHACHT 

M ARK JOHNSON'S summer surf odyssey to Central America 
this year actually began three 
years ago when he stepped off a 
flight from AuStralia. "The minute 
I got back," Johnson said, "I was 
ready to go again." The captain 
of this year's UCSD surf team 
did go again, only this time his 
surfari began in Tijuana. "( 
wanted to go to South Africa 
when I first got back from 
Australia. but with the current 
events portrayed in the media , ( 
decided to go to Central America 
instead ," Johnson said . 

Johnson made his two-month 
trip this summer with a fellow 

surfer from the surf club, Gath 
Nobel. "I met Gath a couple of 
years ago, and he had already 
been to Costa Rica before that," 
Johnson said, "so we decided to 
do a tour of some of the surf 
spotS down there. So we saved a 
lot of money over the past few 
years - ( bussed a lot of tables 
- and the minute finals were 
over last spri ng, we took off." 

After boarding a flight in 
Tijuana, Nobel and Johnson hit 
the first stOP on their trip a few 
days later, Porto Escondido -
two hundred miles south of 
Acapulco - provided the lads 
with some of the best surf they'd 
ever had. "Escondido is known 

as the MeXican Pipehne, and the 
waves were fantastic when it 
breaking. There was a nice beach 
break and the point break was 
superb too. The beach break was 
10 feet and when the point gOt 
over six feet it was a great wave. 

The tiny fishing village 
provided some monstrous waves 
during the three weeks they were 
there , and , as Johnson des ribes 
it, "we were not alone by any 
means. There were a lot of guys 
there from Florida and Texas, 
and on the bigger days they were 
really getting hurt. A bunch of 
guys went out on the point one 
day when it was breaking and

Belly Up 
tonight 

It would - or at least should 
- be impossible to do an issue 
of Hiatus on American music 
without talking about zydeco, 
that gloriously danceable music 
concocted by the Acadian people of Louisiana. 

And it would be impossible to talk about zydeco - which is, 
incidentally, pronounced in the French manner, with no accented 
syllables - without mentioning the king of zydeco, Clifton Chenier. 
The incredible accordionist - whose last name is pronounced "shen-
yay," although you can probably call him "shen-eer" (or just plain 
Clifton) - has been playing this amazing musical gumbo of blues, r&b, 
soul and even wain tunes for the past ~ years. 

Unfortunately, at age 60, Chenier has been often prone to illness. His 
last three scheduled concerts at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach 
were cancelled for that reason, but that hasn't stopped the Belly Up 
from booking him again, and it certainly hll$n't stopped Chenier. 

This may be your last chance to see this national treasure, 50 don't 
blow it. ~

Stevie Ray Vaughan and 

Double Trouble are coming to 
town, and here's a wanting for 
all you would-be guitar 

Blues you can use The band's second album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, has sold 500,000 copies. It was 
a more polished work than the 
first and further solidified 

aficianados and heavy metal goons. You're the 
ones in for a dose of double trouble, because this 
is a man who knows how to play guitar the way it 
was meant to be played. Recipient of Guitar 
Pla,er's International Blues Guitar Player of the 
Year award for an unprecedented third straight 
year, Vaughan wiU bring his band - Chris 
"Whipper" Layton on drums, Tommy Shannon 
on bass and newly added keyboardist Reese 
Wynans to UCSD's main gym this Sunday for a 
night of blues and rock done the old-fashioned. 
way - the right way. 

Popular folklore has it that blues legends are 
born, not made. Names like Muddy Waters, 
Willie Dixon, Albert Colling or B.B. King seem as 
old as the blues tradition itself. Most rock heroes, 
on the other hand, often seem to be just as much 
the product of slick Madison Avenue P.R. men 
and hairdressers as they are of their own talent. 
Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble would 
certainly fit into the former category rather than 
the latter. But it may be the latter that helps 
establish Vaughan as the star that his creativity 
and talent suggest he is. 

Playing guitar as though born with one in his 
hands (the 3o..year-old has been playing for 22 
years), Vaughan'S reputation soared three years 
ago when David Bowie chose him to play guitar in 
his smash LP Let's Dance . But throughout 
Vaughan's career, and with the recent release of 
his band's third album Soul to Soul, it is easy to see 
that Vaughan has not strayed far from his roots. 

Vaughan grew up in Dallas and learned to play 
guitar from his older brother Jimmie Vaughan of 
the Fabulous Thunderbirds. By the time he was 
eight years old, Stevie Ray was playing in bands 
and eventually moved to Austin where he began 
sitting in with blues legends like B.B. King and 
Albert Collins. After becoming a top draw in his 
native state, Vaughan and Co. made a surprise 
appea:.tnce at the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival in 
Switzerland where his performance established 
him as the up-and-coming talent in blues and 
rock. 

In the great bluesmen tradition, Vaughan 
recently performed a gig with Double Trouble for 
the benefit of the prisoners at Oregon state's 
maximum security prison in Salem, Oregon. In 
front of a full-house of convicts, (including Jimmy 
Bernard, the president of the entertainment 
committee that organized the event who is doing 
20 years for armed robbery). Vaughan put on a 
show that left them ecstatic. "The prison gig," 
Vaughan said in a telephone interview last week, 
"is something the group as a whole has wanted to 
do for a long time - we'd never played a 
maximum security prison before and jumped at 
the opportunity. We thought we could bring a 
little excitement into that atmosphere. It was a real 
treat for us." Vaughan's latest album was even 
released to the prison authorities for the convicts 
three days before it ever hit the streets; the 
inmates were so thrilled when they learned he was 

coming that they made Vaughan a customized 
guitar strap bearing his initials. 

A few days later, Vaughan also received an offer 
from Jackson Browne to perform in a live show in 
Tuscon from which the proceeds would go to the 
Sanctuary Defense Movement. The show raised 
$68,000 to aid the defense fund of those people 
accused of giving sanctuary to refugees fleeing 
repression in EI Salvador and Honduras. "I talked 
Jackson's offer over with the other band 
members, and we decided it was a worthy cause," 
Vaughan said. Among others donating their time 
were Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley and Stevie Nicks. 

In this day and age of videos and slick P.R. 
promotions, it would appear that talent and 
creativity are no guarantee of success, and one 
must actively recruit publicity in orer to survive. 
But as a · testimony to Vaughan'S talent, the 
modern world of rock and roll has gone out in 
search of Vaughan and his band. Aside from the 
Bowie album, the guitarist was recently asked to 
provide the soundtrack for "Rocky IV, " as well as 
William (The Exorcist) Friedkin's upcoming film 
with Gregory Peck entitled Judgement Day . Sean 
Penn and Sam Shepard - two more fans of 
Vaughan - have also asked him to do work on 
their upcoming film projects. 

Charles Comer is Vaughan'S publicity director, 
and has also served in that capacity for the Rolling 
Stones and reggae star Peter Tosh. Comer claims 
that "Stevie Ray and Double Trouble are one of 
the hottest acts around in rock and roll," and as 
evidence offers the 230 or so concerts Vaughan 
will be playing this year, including one on the 
bridge of the Aircraft carrier Pelou in San 
Francisco Bay to 25,000 sailors. But the hard 
work that Double Trouble put in this year is 
nothing new for th~ band that has averaged 200 
road dates a year since their formation five years 
ago. 

A bastion of modern rock hoopla - MTV -
has even devoted an entire "Rock Influences" 
show (a rare occurrence) to Stevie Ray Vaughan 
on October 20. Rolling Stone recently featured a 
long article on Vaughan'S adopted home town of 
Austin in which Vaughan and his local legacy 
featured prominently. 

But it is the story behind the Montreux festival 
in '82 that has laid the groundwork for all that has 
followed for Stevie Ray Vaughan. A relative 
unknown at that time, Vaughan took the limelight 
at the show even though he had no record contract 
at the time. Among those in attendance were 
Bowie and Browne, the latter donating free studio 
time to Double Trouble at his Down Town Studio 
in Los Angeles. In one short week under the 
direction of the legendary John Hammond -
whose other discoveries include Billie Holiday, 
Count Basie, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen-
Double Trouble recorded their first album, Texas 
Flood, which has sold 250,000 copies without the 
benefit of a hit single. 

The MACINTOSH 
ttBack-To-School" Bundle 

INCLUDES: 

Vaughan's reputation as a blues specialist, while 
also allowing him to expand into some 
experimental rock fields, including a version of 
Hendrix's "Voodoo Chile" the author might be 
proud of. The album went gold in both Australia 
and New Zealand, and made it into the top 20 in 
the States. Vaughan also received his third 
Grammy nomination for the album, the first two 
coming for the cut "Rude Mood" for best rock 
instrumental and "Texas Aood" for best 
traditional blues album. Fame and glory did come 
to Vaughan last year as his band won best new 
blues act and Stevie Ray Vaughan became the first 
non-black to ever win Bluesman of the Year 
Award. 

The band's latest album may contain less raw 
energy than his previous two, but makes up for 
any loss of intensity with an increase in 
production sound. The addition of Reese 
Wynans on keyboards has helped Vaughan 
concentrate more on his lead guitar. "Reese has 
really-added depth·to our sound," Vaughan said, 
"and this helps me personally, especially in the 
live shows. We've got a fuller texture to our sound 
now." 

As far as his fans are concerned, the more 
Vaughan plays his guitar, the better. Perhaps not 
since Jimi Hendrix has a guitarist dominated the 
blues/ rock genre like Vaughan. Indeed, given the 
similar stratocaster sound and playing styles, 
Hendrix is the guitarist most often mentioned 
when comparisons are made. Not exactly bad 
company. On Vaughan'S last album he covers an 
old Earl King song - "Come On" - which 
Hendrix also re-made on Electric Wyland and 
subtitled "Part l." Vaughan has subtitled his 
version "Part m," and his cover of the song 
suggests that the Hendrix heritage continues. 
Vaughan considers it by no means an insult when 
he is compared to Hendrix. although he insists he 
is still his own guitarist. "Jimi Hendrix was the 
greatest player of his time," Vaughan said, "and 
he left his mark on all our lives." 

But before one gets the notion that Stevie Ra y is 
merely another in a series of Hendrix play-alikes, 
Vaughan's blues roots cannot be overlooked. 
When Stevie Ray is not on the road or in the 
studio, he is generally making with blues legends 
like B.B. King, Albert Collins, Bobby Bland, Big 
Mama Thornton, Albert King and others. 
Vaughan, for his part, refuses to place himself in 
either category. "Rock and roll is a direct 
progression from the blues and they are really 
Inseparable. Personally I don't like to stick myself 
in anyone category." 

The soft-spoken Vaughan would prefer to let 
his guitar do the talking for him, as any good 
guitarist would. In ap. when guitar virtuosity is 
measured in technique, speed and decibels, Stevie 
Ray Vaughan represents a refreshing return to the 
basics of creativity, raw energy and a whole lot of 
.. soul to soul."

In your backyard 
by alicia agol 

It's ironic that KSDT exists 
more in sight than sound for 
the majority of the UCSD 
population. The old adage 
"seen but not heard" 
generally works well, but not 
for a radio station. 

Nestled comfortably in the 
well-traversed Student 
Center, the KSDT office and 
its inhabitants are viewed by a 
lot of people but, as it stands 
now, only a few on-campus 
AM recei vers are able to pick 
up the station's signal. Of 
course, if you are lucky 
enough to possess cable, then 
you're lucky enough to hear 
KSDT. And, as KSDT music 
director Chris Howard puts it, 
"There are crazy people out 
there who get cable just to 
hear us." 

If KSDT is something of a 
mystery, then, it's basically 
due to its inaccessibility. 
KSDT does not have, and 
never has had a spot on the 
coveted FM dial, and that is its 
major problem, one that 
Howard terms "so much 
business. It (getting on the 
airwaves) is not something we 
can do in a real way. We 
haven't been allocated a spot, 
and with the competitive San 
Diego market, getting on the 
air is real difficult. It'd be 
something like a little store 
buying out a big corporation. 

"But it is a possibility. 
Something will open up at 

oct 24 

some time. Sometime (the 
opportunity) will pop out of 
the blue. We could try 
something like fitting 
ourselves in between 93.1 and 
93.3. It's so difficult, though. 
We have to be students still." 

From the outside, KSDT 
looks like any other college 
radio station - a little 
offbeat. Inside, one finds a 
group of people trying to put 
good music on the air. 
Howard finds that, "A lot of 
people think we're into 
obscure music just to be into 
obscure music. That's 
bullshit. Most of the music we 
play is only obscure because 
the other radio stations don't 
play it." 

Many people would be 
surprised to know that KSDT 
was the first radio station in 
San Diego to play "Every-
body, It the first single from, of 
all people, Madonna. "We 
were right on top of that 
single," says Howard. "We 
don't just play music which 
sounds like a cat wrenched 
back over itself. There's room 
for experimentation. People 
should understand that about 
a college station. There's 
room to learn about shit. 

"I think it's thrilling to 
listen to weird noises coming 
from the radio, II Howard 
adds. "People ask us why we 
don't play Cyndi Lauper or 
Bruce Springsteen, but YOU 

$1.00 PER FILM 

Spinnirw a wmW of wand fI'IWic on LC\Vs wry ou.n KSUT, 
u.ftef'e experimentadon co-emu u.Uh acceSlibilit". 

can hear that stuff anywhere. 
This way, people can flip 
between our station and 
another station which will 
play Bruce Springsteen." 

Like any other student-run 
organization, KSDT'6 need 
for student involvement is 
never satiated, and an 
orientation meeting is set for 
tonight at 7 in the Student 
Center's North Conference 
Room. While a lot of people 
are expected to show up, 
perhaps only half of them are 
expected to stay. Howard has 
seen a lot of people "flake 
mid-quarter. 1£ we get 20 
people to stick with us, that's 
great. " 

Simply stepping into KSDT 

won't guarantee you fame and 
fortune as a DJ . But there is, of 
course, always that chance. 
Says Howard, "Generally 
what we ask for is three hours 
a week working in the various 
departments. Sometimes it's 
menial work, but there is the 
chance to get your voice on 
the air." 

What exists at KSDT is the 
opportunity to do new things, 
take some risks and boldly go 
where no man has gone 
before. Howard: "What we 
want are radio shows with a 
diverse mixture of songs. 
After a while our DJs start 
learning about music. People 
can do great shows. There's an 
art to it." 

Annex 
by jay Il'eathoule 

Those of you who missed 
James McAnnich's instal-
lation at the Mandeville 
Annex Gallery last week are 
fortunate that it has been held 
over through tomorrow. 

McAnnish does not 
produce simple-minded 
todder in order to feed 
middle-class aesthetics or 
promote American death 
culture. Therefore, his 
imagery provokes thought, 
even participation, on the part 
of the audience before it 
assumes any dimensions 
beyond that of a simple 
collection of objects. 

This challenge becomes 
even more intriguing when 
this show is considered in 
perspective with his work in 
the same gallery last year. One 
of the advantages of the annex 
shows is this opportunity to 
watch the artists at UCSD 
mature in their vision and 
methodology . Access to 
serious emerging artists at this 
bargain price - you are 
required only to offer your 
time and interest - is a 
benefit available on but a few 
campuses in the nation. 

As McAnnich helps to 
prove, the artists here are 
unique individuals function-
ing in a special environment. 
-- Disawer the Annex Gallery 
on the north side of Ma~lle 
Center at the first basement lew!. 
It is open Monda, through

Bruce for President 
by alicia allOi 

When it comes to Bruce 
Springsteen, Robert Hilburn 
and I are in total agreement. 
Springsteen is an amazement, 
especially in concert. He is a 
buff mass of energy - an 
energy tha: is projected, 
literally drilled, into his 
concert-goers. 

OK, I'U admit I had a few 
pre-Coliseum concert 
qualms . Springsteen's 
concerts are justifiably 
infamous - 83,000 people? I 
was a little worried . 
Springsteen however, is a 
showman, and he adapted his 
show to fit the immense 
dimensions of the Coliseum. 
The media attention, the 
varied faces in the crowd 
(even my mom went), and the 
enormous scope of it all made 

On the 
prowl 

by robin ICOtt 
It was an ugly mission. 
Eight nights ago, after 

ingesting incredible doses of 
caffeine and vitamin 8-12, we 
set out in search of the 
American Dream. 

The big black bird roared 
viciously down the freeway, 
armed with a high~powered 
steel· belted radial concealed 
in the trunk. Down ... down 
we travelled into deeper and 
darker regions of the 
wasteland until we finally 
arrived at its barren core: San 
Diego State University. Could 
anything be more hideous 
than what we had set 
ourselves up for? 

We had come to witness a 
legend. We had come to listen 
to that famed author, media 
critic, hell raiser and frenzied 

mas~er of gonzo journalism: 
Hunter S. Thompson. 

Hunter S. Thompson . . . 
the very one who ran for 
sheriff of Woodle Creek, 
Colorado, talles football with 
Nixon, knows well the depths 

the evening an event, not just a 
concert. [t was four hours and 
45 minutes of uplifting 
motivation, strength. 

Springsteen is a mix of 
emotions. He tells wonder-
fully funny stories of 
searching for a gypsy lady and 
her all~knowing crystal ball, 
but he also has seen and 
doesn't ignore the problems 
in America. With his pitch for 
the Old Timer Steelworkers' 
Fund he is trying to deal with 
some of these problems. 
During the course of his 17~ 
month tour, Springsteen has 
donated over $1 million to 
this fund . In his prelude to 
"My Hometown," Spring~ 
steen recalls what he's seen on 
tour - the unemployed, the 
homeless farmers, those 
cheated by the American 

Marti Jones has a big 
decision ahead c:iher. ~s she

"rm reaDy a doric in front c:i the 
camera. And if rm uncomfor~

Of course, many would argue 
with Jones' self -assessment as 
photographically "ridiculous 
and unsophisticated." 1bose 
same peope \WUld rrobablv 
also dispute the title of her 

Dream. 
The last night of 17 months 

together obviously affected 
the E Street Band. Springsteen 
paid homage to them, to Steve 
Van landt, and to their 
friendship together with a 
slow acoustic version of "No 
Surrender. " 

The quieti introspective 
moments were there. This 
man with his sheer intensity 
and his stories of his family 
and of "running on the 
backstreets" is an incredibly 
motivating force . 

There was also the chance 
to party. The crowd danced 
with him through "Hungry 
Heart," "Rosalita," "Dancing 
in the Dark " (dancing with his 
wife this time, not a girl from 
the crowd) and "Cadillac 
Ranch."

With a fantastic encore of 
"Travelin' Band" Springsteen 
provided some great rock 'n' 
roll. Things have changed, 
however. All the other times 
I've seen Springsteen, he's 
played the LA Sports Arena 
which holds 16,000 people. 
With the Coliseum, well, it's 
you, Bruce and about a zillion 
other people. It's like the 
secret was out. I wanted to ask 
all these people where they'd 
been during The Wild , The 
Innocent, and the E Street 
Shuffle days. Even Reagan is 
trying to get in on the act. 

If Springsteen and his music 
have changed, so has society. 
He's not the rebel cult hero he 
used to be. He's a very 
successful, married musician 
with an ever-growing 
following . Obviously, his 
intentions and priorities have 
changed. He, like the rest of 
the society I is dealing with the 
1980s.

Dixon is more than just a 
producer on Unsophisticated 
Time. He wroce many c:i the 
songs - including "(If I Could) 
Walk Away," which Jones 
delivers in vintage Dusty 
Srringfield style - and plays 
just about every insaument. 

Dixon "discovered" Jones

Passing through the 

Student Center you hear 
strains of a distant melody. 
Following the sound, you find 
yourself in one of the darker 
passages, in front of an open 
door. 

Above hangs a sign reading 
ASSORTED VINYL. Upon 
entering, you are confronted 
with a bright array of records _ 
and posters. To your left are 
displayed the latest albums 
and 12~inch singles; to your 
right, shelves filled with 
records. The wall behind the 
counter supports the "now 
playing" album, the music 
that drew you into the store. 

Wandering within the 
store, you notice a large 
selection of imported records, 
large considering the small size 
of the store. Other categories 
include classical, jazz, soul, 
rock - mostly domestic, but 
with still more imports 
sprinJded in - sound tracks 
and samplers. Also on sale are 
blank cassette and video 
tapes, buttons of bands, 
stereo needles, audio care 
products, guitar strings and 
even skateboards. 

A real plus are the low 
prices. A domestic album 
listio~ at $8.98 sells for only 
$6.9d; an $ll.98~list import 
for $8.85. Assorted Vinyl is 
able to offer students these 
discounts because prices are 
set just high enough to cover 
costs. 

If you cannot find what you 
are looking for, you can 
special-order records ~ , 
cassettes and compact discs. 
The item should arrive in two 
to five days if the distributor 
has it in stock.

feels confident that "these 
yahoos have just about had 
their day." 

The recent evidence that 
has surfaced concerning the 
likelihood that the Korean 
air liner shot down over the 
Soviet Union was on an 
intelligence mission has 

caused him to believe that 
"they had every right to shoot 
it down." Upon making this 
statement he went on to 
explain that although the 
incident was a great tragedy, 
were the circumstances 
reversed, the US should and 
would have react in a similar 
manner. 

Thompson termed the 
current state of journalism 
"unhealthy," citing a lack of 
courage as its most serious 

ailment. In regard to the 
speaker's own life, he stated 
that the craft "has just been 
another way of paying for my 
education. " 

Along with targetting 
members of the audience who 
asked him what he deemed 
ignorant or offensive 
questions, he mercilessly 
insulted Ronald Reagan, Jerry 
Falwell, Bob Woodward, Jann 
Wenner (publisher of Rolling 
Stone), David Stockman and 

especially Ed Meese. 
Those who found favor 

with Thompson included 
John Belushi, Liddy, Gary 
Hart and writer Jim Harrison. 

The point that he sought 
most strongly to impress on 
the "generation of swine" in 
attendance was the "sense of 
possibility" that needs to be 
reinstated within the psyche 
of today's youth. He believes 
that it is "much mt»re fun to 
be human" and to react boldly

to the situations one 
encounters. He summed it up 
best when he said, "If you're 
not a pia yer, you might as well 
2et in line." 

All the rudeness, profanity, 
candor and twisted wisdom 
that have made Thompson 
such a cult figure over the 
years were on display, but in 
him these qualities are not 
mere!y a pose but rather a 
promise of action.
