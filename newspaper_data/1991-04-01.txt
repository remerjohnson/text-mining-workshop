Price Center Rooded by 
Torrential Spring Rains 
By Mary Betty Heard 
Associate News Editor 

Students weren't the only ones 
swamped during finals week. 

Due to heavy rains, the Price 
Center began flooding early on the 
morning of March 19, cnusmgthou-
sands of dollars worth of damage to 
both the PIice Center bookstore and 
theater. 

Problems arose when water 
streamed down from two sources 
into the PIice Center, clogging drains 
and seeping under doors. 

According to Principle Custo-
dial Supervisor Mary Ann Mason, 
water from one of the dirt hills in the 
Central Library construction area 
did not drain properly and flowed 
down into the back entrance of the 
theater. 

"It was heartbreaking," she said, 
referring to the damage to the the-
ater. 

While Mason could not estimate 
the exact cost of damage to the 
theater, she did say that a tremendous 
amount of work went into cleaning 
the mess. The Stanley Steamer car-

pet cleaning service was used for 
much of the work. 

According to Mason, other 
sources of flooding included the 
hills near Mandeville Center and 
the Student Health Services build-
ing. Water from both areas flowed 
onto the Price Center second floor 
walk and down the stairs into the 
plaza. 

The drains in the plaza clogged 
quickly with debris from the euca-
lyptus grove. 

"It came down too fast for the 
drain. [It) filled up with mud and 
debris," Mason said. 

Don Moon, assistant bookstore 
director, said that he was notified of 
the flooding at about 3:30 am. on 
March 19. 

According to Moon, the sidewalk 
on the second floor landing of the 
Price Center turned into a river that 
seeped under the bookstore's front 
door, filling most of the clothing 
section with water and mud. 

The water then leaked through 
the concrete floor to the first floor

Chodorow Withdraws From U. of Arizona Presidential Race 
• UCSD dean of Arts and Humanities was one of five in the running for position 
By Phil Gruen 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the selection of the new 
president of the University of Ari-
zona at Thscon set to be determined 
today by the Arizona Board of Re-
gents, UCSD's Dean of Arts and 
Humanities Stanley Chodorow has 
decided he no longer wants to be 
considered for the post. . 

Chodorow, who also holds the 
position of associate vice chancel-
lor of academic planning at UCSD, 
explained that the decision to with-
draw from the race belonged to both 
he and his wife Peggy, and came 
after an all-day interview on 
Wednesday. Chodorow explained 
that during the day - and part of the 
night - he was questioned by many 

different members of the university 
community, including students, ad-
ministrators, members of the ath-
letic department, and the regents. 

"It was a matter of learning 
enough so that you can make your 
mind up," Chodorow said of the 
questioning he and Peggy sat 
through. "The [University of Ari-
zona) is a strong campus, a very 
good university .... But [the presi-
dency] would have changed our 
personal lives in a way that we found 
unacceptable, so we dropped out." 

Chodorow indicated that a pri-
mary concern for his decision fo-
cused on the prominence of a presi-
dent at a major university in the state 
of Arizona, and how it could trickle 
down and affect a far more impor-

Number of SHes for 10th UC 
campusNa"owedtoTh~ 
By Jason Snell 
News Editor 

Despite state fmancial diffi-
culties and UC budget woes, the 
UC Board of Regents has contin-
ued planning for a tenth campus, 
and narrowed the list of possible 
sites to three. 

1be regents approved a rec-
onunendation from UC President 
David Gardner to concentrate site 
evaluation activities on three ar-
eas in the San Joaquin Valley -
the Lake Yosemite site, six miles 
northeast of Merced; the Table 
Mountain site, 12 miles north of 
downtown Fresno in Madera 
County; and the Academy site in 
Fresno County, 10 miles east of 
Oovis. 

"It has become clear to us that 
any of these three candidates will 
successfully serve the needs of the 
Central Valley and the university," 
Gardner said. "We look forward to 
continuing our work, not only with 
these supportive communities, but 
with those whose sites will not be 
advanced for further study. " 

1be narrowing of the selection 
process eliminated five other pro-
spective sites for the new campus. 
Those sites were Mape' s Ranch in 
Stanislaus County, just west of 
Modesto; Don Pedro in Tuolumne 
County, 40 miles east of Modesto; 
Watts Valley and Trimmer Springs, 
both in Fresno County about 25 
miles east of downtown Fresno; and

tant concern: his marriage. 
"My marriage is more important 

to me than any old job ... [peggy) 
was not going to become Mrs . 
President," he said. Chodorow added 
that ifhe had been chosen, he would 
have been "one of the most promi-
nent figures in the state... J was 
going to have to be out four nights a 
week, at least. I'm not a socialite." 

Chodorow also stressed that 
Peggy - a real estate agent in the 
San Diego area-felt that the market 
in Tuscon was not up to her stan-
dards, and that that played as much 
a part in the decision as anything 
else. He did not, however, deny that 
the interview process was an erl-
riching experience, nor did he 
downplay the opportunity to affect

awIRl wiD be preseDIed to FRd Spica, profeaor of 
oce .. ognqA.y. Scripps InsIitulioo of 0ca00p1apby. 

Spiess wiD receive the Distinguished Public Service 
Award at ceremonies today in Washington. D.C. at die 
office of the secretary of the Navy at the Peruaaon. Tbe 
award will bepresentedbyGeraJdCann,assistantsecretary 
of the Navy for research, development, and acquisition, 
who has cited Spiess "for outstanding. distinguished 
service 10 the Navy, for world-leading accomplishments 
in ocean science and tectmology." 

Spiess was specifically cited for his scientific effon 
and tecbnology for the Navy on the low-frequency Seis-
mic-Acoustic Experiment from April through September 
1989. Spiess guided an expedition to implant amulti-nodc 
array into a deep-sea borehole in more than 16,000 feet of 
Waletusing a remotely operated vdt.icle whichbcdesigned. 

This new technique has potential applications for 
Navy sensors. The experiment was developed for studies 
of the pbysics and propagation of !ow-frequency energy 
above, til, and below the sea floor. 

Spiess joined Scripps Institution of Oceanography's 
Marine Physical Laboratory(MPL) in 19S2andwasMPL 
d.i.rectocfrom 1958to 1980. From 1 980-88 he was director 
of the UC' s Institute of Marine Resources, headquartered 
at UCSD, while retaining his faculty association with 
Scripps Institution and continuing his research at MPL. 

Spiess has led an average of two expeditions a year as 
an active scientist for more than 30 years. His research 
interests have includedstudies of long-range propagation 
of sound and related underwaterconununication systems, 
oceangoing stable platfonns and deep-towedinstrumenlS 
systems, fi.ne.scale properties of the deep-sea floor, phe-
nomena associated with plate tectonics and seafloor 
spreading, and seafloor geodesy.

UC President Gardner Presents Budget Proposal to State Legislature 
By Jason Snell 
News Editor 

University of California Presi-
dent David Gardner presented the 
UC's 1991-92 budget proposal to 
the state legislature late last month 
while also outlining a new financial 
aid package that would, he said, help 
counteract the 4(}.percent student 
fee increase contai~ within the 
proposal. 

Gardner addressed the Senate 
Budgetand Fiscal Review Subcom-
mittee in Sacramento as the sub-
committee began considering the 
UC's $2.484 billion budget request 
According to Gardner spokesman 
Ron Kolb, the UC Board ofRegenrs 
claims thAt the sum is "essential to 
maintaining the current level and 
quality ofUC programs." The UC 
budget outlined by Governor Pete 
Wilson is $295 million less than the 
budget proposed by the regents. 

1be state legislature will now 
develop its own budget proposal, 
due for submission to Wilson prior 
to June 30. 

Gardner told the subcommittee 
that the UC's actions were devel-

thatduringthoseyears,Califomia's 
public educational system featured 
only two prominent institutions -
UC Berkeley and UCLA. - while 
Arizona is in that stage now with the 
University of Arizona at Tuscon 
and Arizona State University in 
Tempe. With Arizona's population 
currently growing by leaps and 
bounds, Chodorow forsees a stir-
ring future for its education. 

"To playa role in [helping shape 
Arizona's education] would be very 
exciting," he said. "But the cost of 
that would be too high for me." 

Owdorow received his doctor-
ate in history from Cornell Univer-
sity in 1968 and has wolkedatUCSD 
ever s.ince. He entered UCSD's ad-
ministration in 1983 in addition to 
his teaching post in the History 
Department, but has taught only 
five courses in the past eight years. 

TIle need for a president at the 
University of Arizona arose when 
President Henry Koffler resigned 
last summer. Chodorow was one of 
five finalists selected by a search 
committee after an intitial interview 
itbcld with 14candidates during the 
week of March 10, and another in-
terview with the Arizona regents on 
March 16. The regents will decide 
today between the four remaining 
candidates, three of whom are al-
ready presidents at American uni-
versities. 

The remaining candidates in-
clude Roben Duncan, p~ident of 
Northwestern University; Manuel 
Pacheco, president of Houston-
Downtown; Henry Ponder, presi-
dent of Fisk University; and 
Raymond Orbach, provost ofLetters 
and Sciences at UCLA.

quality was our principal objective. 
On behalfofthe next generation, we 
have an obligation to nurture and

Wilson's budget proposal pr0-

But Gardner warned that the 
measures the UC is currently plan-
ning are short tenn, and cannot be 
repeated in the future. 

"We cannot repeatedly deny 
general salary increases, or defer 
merit increases - not if we wish to 
remain competitive," he said. "We 
cannot ir':tiate further reductions in 
undergraduate enrollments without 
immediately confronting the issue 
of access for eligible Californians. 
Wecannot,yearafteryear.continue 
to impose student fee increases of 
the magnitude now recommended." 

Gardner made a special point of 
defending the student fee increase, 
which would bring mandatory uni-
versity fees to $2,274 a year for 
resident undergraduates. 

"In constant dollars, UC fee in-
creases have generally lagged be-
hind increases in the average 
Californian's income," Gardner 
said. "Adjusting for people's ability 
to pay through personal income 
changes, the resulting fee level will 
still be below the 1971-72 level and 

UC President David Gardner 
about the same as the fee level in the 
early 1980s." 

Gardner also announced at the 
meeting a measure to aid needy 
middle-income students whose 
ability to recei ve aid to cover the fee 
increase would be limited by estab-
lished financial aid fOmlulas. 

Under the new plan, needy stu-

THE CALIFORNIA DROUGHT 

Water, Water Everywhere? 
Five years into a major drought, faced with the nearly eminenl 

possibility of mandatory water rationing, brown lawns, yellow 
toilets, and grey water, one would think that the city govellU1lClll 
o(San Diego would have realized by now that the water situation 
is really serious. Forthe last four years, politicians across the state 
- especially in parched cities like Santa Balbara - have come 
to realizethat their prayers fordrougbl n:liefwill not be answered. 
These are desperate times, and, for lack of better preparation, the 
people of California must now pay the price for their excessive 
water use. 

San Diego is the last major city in Califomia to acknowledge 
the inevitability of seven: water resaictions. Mayor Maureen 
O'Conner and the city council have been reluctanllo impose 
water cutbacks on city residents for months. Even after the 
Metropolitan Wata Disttict (MWD), which serves most of 
Southern California (including Los Angeles and San Diego), 
announced that it 'would be cutting its water deliveries to San 
Diego County by 50 percent, city officials were still unwilling to 
impose mtioning.1t was the County Board of Supervisors which 
had the coumge to step in and acknowledge the gravity of the 
situation, imposing extremely severe regulations on water use 
two weeks ago. 

The recent storms and the massive rainfall which accompa-
nied them are perfect examples of the mayor's blindness to the 
realities of California's water crisis. After the rain stopped 
falling, the mayor essentially declared San Diego's water woes 
to be over. The mayor apparently believed that two days of heavy 
rainfall couJdsoJvea five-year problem. Ifnothing else, common 
sense dictates otherwise. 

While the storm did in fact bring above average rainfall, and 
raised the water levels in several of the state's and county's 
pitifully low reservoirs, the storm was not the godsend many 
people have tried to make it out to be. Most of the reservoirs are 
till far below capacity. Others are overflowing with water that 

is simply going to waste. The Colorado River is swelling with 
water that the neither the MWD nor the San Diego County Water 
Authority has the means to harness. The MWD has begun re-
evaluating its assessment of a 50 percent water cutback to its 
customers, but it will probably only amend that assessment to 30 
percent. Any way you slice it, the problem is still with us. 

O'Cormor's rash judgement is particularly surprising, con-
sidering the fact that San Diego receives 90 percent of its water 
from the MWD. If 50, or possibly 30 percent of that wateris cut, 
from where does the mayor expect to compensate for that loss? 
Certainly not from the half-full reservoirs around the city. 

Oearly, O'Connordoes not want to be remembered by voters 
as the mayor who made the city's toilets yellow. But that image, 
as unpleasant as it is, will be something San Diegans will have to 
get used to. The days of voluntary conservation are past 'They 
were over last summer, but nobody wanted to admit it The 
question is no longer one of the severity of the crisis, but rather 
how to manage the crisis before it gets worse. 

TIle city has denied its water problem for five years. Now it 
is time to consider that this problem may only get worse befon: 
it gets bener. The drought could last forsix, seven, oreight years. 
Or maybe longer. If that is the case, the city will have to grapple 
with solutions far more courageous, albeit more painful ec0-
nomically, than the resttictions we are likely to face beginning 
April 15, For one, the city and county both will have to seriously 
consider imposing zero..growth initiatives and put a stop to 
further development Santa Barbara and other coastal cities have 
had such regulations in effect for some years now. 

TIlere is some hope. San Diego should be praised for partici-
pating in the development of a desalination plant to be built in 
Baja California in conjunction with Mexico. While the desali-
nation of seawater is extremely expensive, this city has the 
resources to afford it on a large scale if worse comes to worse. 
Planners say that the plant will produce five million gallons of 
water per day, and should be on-line in five years. In the mean 
time, local resean::h institutions (such as UCSD) should look into 
ways of making desalination technology more feasible economi-
cally. If this drought continues, what seems impractical or 
infeasible today may be the onJy answer tomorrow.

EL SALVADOR: Peace, democracy on the horizon 
Continued from p.ge ..

were constantly dashed by the 
rebels ' frequent returns to fight-
ing. 

Events took another turn when 
on Ian, 2 of this year, Salvadoran 
rebels executed thn:e U.S. service-
men. A$ a result, President Bush 
agn:ed to restorefuU military aid if 
the rebels did not agree to comply 
with the United Nations' proposed 
peace initiative. 

With the U.N. peace proposal 
on the table and the recent free 

elections behind them, peace may 
be on the horizon for El Salvador. 
Indeed.. last month's elections in-
dicated waning suppon for the 
leftist coalition,leaving them with 
only 12 percent of the vote na-
tionwide and 20 percent in the 
capital. Fonunately, the com-
mander of the main rebel grouP. 
the Farabundo Marti National 
Uberation Front, has agreed to 
discard communism as weU as the 
goal of one-party rule, Now the 
rebels claim tbey are willing 10

CAMPUS: Three San Joaquin sites selected 
Continued from page 1 
Frazier Valley in Tulare County, 
about 7 miles from Porterville. 

University officials said they 
were not willing to give specific 
reasons why the fmal three sites 
were chosen, citing the confidential 
nature of the process and forth-
coming negotiations on land ac-
quisition. 

UC SeniorVice President Ronald 
Brady, coordinator of the Sire Se-
lection Task Force, said that the 
Lake Yosemire, Table Mountain, 
and Academy sites "did better col-
lectively on our 33 different [crite-
ria for a new campus) than the oth-
as." 

William Baker, UC Vice Presi-

dent for Budget and University R~ 
lations, said that all eight potential 
sites posse.'IS outstanding creden-
tials, but "they can't all be selected. " 

Baker, who also chairs theTenth 
Campus Citize.n5 Advisory CounciJ 
of representative citizens from 
throughouttheCentrai Valley, added 
that he and other university admin-
istrators will continue to rely on 
input from supporters of both the 
remaininl candidate sites and the 
former candidates. 

"It's going to be a campus for the 
people of the San Joaquin Valley 
and the stale of California. not just 
for the people in a particular city or 
town," Baker said. 

The regents officially gave the 

tenth campus the working title of 
"The San Joaquin Campus" at their 
meeting on March. IS. 

Brady said the next year will be 
spent continuing the university's 
analytical work on the three final 
sites and engaging in discussions 
with landowners as well as commu-
nity and govenunentleaders. 

Depending upon the Stale'S fis-
cal circumstances, the UC plans to 
make its final site selection early in 
1992. 

"We expect the San Joaquin 
campus to open between 1998 and 
2000," Gardner said. adding that he 
felt the opening date will "more 
likely be 2000" due to state fiscal 
and budgetary problems.

FLOODING 
Continued from page 1 
foyer and the greeting card section. 
Most of the damaged goods were 
greeting cards and general books. 

"The textbookdepamnent rnan-
aged to escapedwnage."Moonsaid 

While worlcers were able to clean 
up the first floor in time for opening 
on March 19, most of the second 
floor was closed for three days. The 
computer department, however, 
remained open. ' 

Moon approximated that 1000 
gallons of water were removed from 
the bookstore. 

Approximately $20,000 worth 
of damage was caused by the water. 
Another $ 10,000 to $20,000 is esti· 
mated as revenue lost from the 
necessary closure of damaged 
bookstore sections. Moon said that 
exact damage figures are still being 
determined for insurance purposes. 

Neither Mason nor Moon said 
they believed that any of the water 
damage was caused by structural 
problems with the Price Center 
building. Rather, they think that the 
problem is with the landscaping 
surrounding the building and the 
drains. 

Congratu lations! 
Mason added that if the heavy 

flooding had happened during the 
day ratherthan at night, her workers 
may have been able to prevent some 
of the flooding.

"If it happens when my people 

aren't working, which is from 12:30 
am. to6am., thenwearen ' tgoing

Looking forward to travelling with her husband, Marilyn Wilson enjoys her last days working at Central Library. 

• Money-saving 
program offers 
benefits to early 
retirees 
By Kent Korzon 
Senior Staff Writer 

Over the last 25 years, Marilyn 
Wilson has become accustomed to 
change. Central LibraIy. where 
"er office is located. didn't exist. 

WI~n she first began working at 
UCSn Her department moved 
there front what is now the 
Undergradlr.te Library at 
Galbraith Hall, ~fter Central's 
construction in 1910, 

"It was the 'not-so-r.entra! ' 
library. You couldn't evC'a get 
from here to Revelle to get a 
sandwich," reminisced Wilson, 
who heads the Acquisitions 
Department for UCSD's libraries. 
"But, growth got closer." 

While the view from her 
window, which faces the natural 
preserve, hasn't changed that 
much. the once-isolated library 
now nearly lives up to its name. 

"Working [at UCSD] has been 
unusual. Every two years there are 
major changes ... dynamic, 
continual growth," Wilson nOled. 

And she looks back at her 
years at UCSD with fond memo-
ries. 

"It's a wonderful place to 
work. [11lere' s] never a dull 
moment, primarily because there's ' 
a good, wonderful group of people 
[to work with)," she said. "It's 
hard to leave friends." 
_ Today brings a change that 

Wilson did not forsce a year ago. 
She's not coming in to work -
she's going skiing (a life-long 
passion). and then heading to 
Hawaii. 

"Then I'll do all the things I 
said I'd do later .... My husband 
and I will buy an RV (and 

" I had not planned to retire. [But, it was] finan-
cially hard to refuse. The pie looked awfully 

good. 

" MARILYN WILSON 
head of O<antral Library's Acquisitions Department 

travel)," she said 
Unlike many who watch t~ 

r,tay of their retirement slowly 
creep closer, Wilson's decision to 
retire was sudden. 

"I had not planned to retire. 
[But, it was] financially hard to 

" refuse. 1be pie looked awfully 
good," she said_ 

That pie was the Voluntary 
Early Retirement Program 
(VERIP). or rather its incentive, 
the "Plus Five" program, brought 
about by Califomia's budget 
shortfall this year. Eligible faculty 
and staff who retired by March 31, 
will receive, under the auspices of 
the program, credit on their 
retirement plans for five extra 
years of service. Thus, an em-
ployee who has worked at UCSD 
for 2.5 years can retire with 

benefits equivalent to having 
worked 30. That extra credit 
means more money with their 
retirement checks, and more time 
to Qend it. 

El'!tibilility for the program 
was baso.l on the sum of the 
worker's a~and years of service, 
and was limited.,Jo those at least 
50 years old. StaI'rmembers 
needed a sum of 75 ~, and 
faculty a sum of 80 yeaB~ 
qualify for VERIP. For exaltlple, 
a 55 year-old staff member wn _ 
had worked in the UC system for' 
20 years would have a sum of75, 
and wouldbe eligible for the Plus 
Five program. 

While the program gives 
UCSD employees the incentive 
and benefits needed to retire 
early, it wasn't born of generos-

ity, but of neces ity. 
"The budget outlook was 

grim," Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Personnel Quelda Wilson said. 
"[VERIP was) one of the mea-
sures used to reduce cost .... If 
enough take advantage of 
voluntary retirement, [UCSD] can 
avoid involuntary layoffs." 

The logic behind it is simple: 
not all of those retiring will be 
replaced, and those thaI are will be 
replaced with less experienced 
workers. This saves money. 

According to Quelda Wilson, 
out of roughly 12,000 UCSD 
faculty and staff, 630 qualified for 
VERIP. And as of March 28, 326 
(or 52 percent) of those had 
indicated the desire to retire. This 
exceeded the program's goal of 50 
percent, she said, and there were 
three more days left for people to 
flle applications. 

Besides affecting the budget 
and the workplace at UCSD, the 
sudden retirement of such a large 
group will leave its mark on the 
750-member UCSD Retirement 
Association, which was founded 
in 1985, 

"In the last couple weeks. 
we've had about 30 phone calls, 
some for 10 packages of infonna-
rion at a time," said Maryann 
Herbenar, executive director of 
the UCSD Retirement Associa-
tion, and its only paid employee. 

'The association's mission is to 
encourage and support interaction 
among retirees, and between 
retirees and UCSD. Open to 
UCSD emeriti, retirees, and their 
spouses. it receives its income 
from annual dues, some university 
funding, and money from fund-
nusing efforts and donations. 

"We're not a rocking-chair 
envi~ent," Herbenar said. "A 
lot of people continue to be 
involved in qmpus life [after 
retirement]. "

Pulitzer Prize 
Winner Styron 
Discusses 
Writing Career 
By Sangeeta Mehta 
Associate Features Editor 

His first novel was 
entitled Lie DowlI ill 
Darkness. His most recent, 
Darkness Visible. But 
when Pulitzer Prize-
winning William Sly ron 
visited UCSD last month, 
he shed light upon his 
writing career - one 
which has deemed him one 
of the most distinguished 
authors in the country. 

Styron has focused on 
such topics as slavery (The 
Confessions of Nat 
Turner) and war (Set this 
House on Fire and 
Sophie's Choice). Speak-
ing as pan of tbe Great 
Author Series sponsored 
by the Friends of the 
UCSD Library, he 
addressed a factor that 
actually underlies his 
writing - depression. 

At a young age, Styron 
"beat it back" with 
alcohol. Yet, depression 
affected his writing from 
ao early point in his career. 

"The presense of 
depreSSion as a factor in ' 
my life was so omnipres-
ent that it was my compan-
ion at all times," the 65 
year-old author said_ "The 
invasion of my psyche by 
depression ... transferred 
itself to the written pages 
of my work." , 

One of these works is 
Sophie's Choice, perhaps 
his most celebrated novel. 
Sophie, an Auschwitz 
survivor, is unable to 
accomodate herself in the 
years after the war, Styron 
explained. Eventually, she 
participates in a double 
suicide with her lover. 

"Suicide is a persistent 
theme in my books," 
Styron said. "Three of my 
characters kill them-
selves." 

The storyline of 
Sophie's Choice, which 
was published on Styron's "' 
54th birthday. reflects 
aspects of his life - not 
only his own suicidal 

~cies, but also his 
memories of Sophie. , 

"[My] parti~ular -
inspiration about Sopbl4 . 
[was that] it did ~I.t 
woke up one momb).g.~ 
the memOry of this' JiJl t 
and said, 'My Ood;this is I 
my story .. " I 

In his PulitzetPrize- 1 
winning novel The t 
ConfeSSions of Nat Turner, ' 
Styron "was more or less 1

depressive mood in [Nar

Membership in the association 
offers perquisites such as access to 
productions of UCSO' Depart-
ments of Theaue and Music, Uni-
versity Events, admission to the 
international film series, and free 
seating at Mandell Weiss perfor-
mances. 

"There are values to belonging 
to the association," she said. "Re-
tirement is getting to be exciting to 
work toward." 

In addition to entenainment. the 
association will be offering hous-
ing. Recently, it was announced that 
members of the association will be 
allowed to obtain rental space in 
UCSO's La Jolla Del Sol Apan-
ments, which will create an 
intcrgenerational community there . 

II is anticipated that this conunu-
nity will be connected with various 
UCSO services, including the 
Medical Center, and Parking and 
Transportation Scrvices. While there 
are no members living there now, 
according to Hemenar, a section 
within the complex will be avail-
able to them. 

One of the goals of the associa-
tion is the promotion of volunteer 
work. The association office itself is 
staffed by 16 volunteers, and an-
other 15 are elected to serve on the 
association's board of directors. 

Through the association, some 
volunteers arrange carpooling to 
association events, helpoutatevents 
at UCSD, assist at hospitals and 
with UCSO publications, and even 
offer to assist in their areas in times 
of emergency. Others plan outings.

Reading other authors' work 
can be an asset to the aspiring 
writer, Styron implied. As a stu-
dent, he read "everything" from 
"all centurie ." 

The authors he mentioned in-
cl ude Fitzgerald, Hemingway , 
Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, and Vir-
ginia Woolf. About them, Styron 
noted, "All of these writers have 
e tablished individual voices." 

Styron admitted to "slavishly" 
imitating authors he admires. 

"There's nothing wrong with 
that. Ultimately you find your own 
voice." Styron added that this is 
the most important aspect of writ-
ing. 

Styron also tried to find his 
identity in hi s books, 

"I always felt that 1 would write 
for myself," he said, 

For whomever Styron wrote, 
his novels have received world-
wide recognition - so much that 
he has been compared to 
Dostoyevski and Faulkner. But his 
works, like those of other writers , 

Author William Styron 
have been criticized. 

"I've received my share of 
hateful criticism," Styron said, 
explaining that he has been called 
"racist" and "morally senile." 

"But I knew better. 1 knew 
what I'd done. Ultimately you

don't let it bother you one way or

About hi s prize-winning work,

to put down on paper."

Driving Miss 'Dessa 
By Andy Clarke 
Staff Writer 

Andy Warhol's life reads like a 
plot from one of tho e Hollywood 
movies of the 1940 . A young man 
i born into poverty and a child-
hood of emotional problem and 
has to work [0 support his family. 
At the age of 21. he moves to the 
big city (in this ca e New York).

covered," becomes 
a phenomenon and 
eventually die in 
my terious and 
tragic circum-
stances. 

With a life of 
such cinematic po-
tential, it wa al-
most inevitablc that 
a movie of War-
hol 's life would 
quickly follow the 
recent profusion of 
print biographies 
that have appeared. 

Warhol once 
claimed that if one 
wanted to find out 
about him, one 
should "look at the surface of my 
paintings and films and me, and 
there r am. There's nothing behind 
it.""Superstar: The Life and Times 
of Andy Warhol" would, however, 
seem to prove him wrong.

of the freedom that the documen-

Particularly impressive i the 
equence over the opening credits. 

Beginning with a tiny pnotograph 
of Warhol, a huge, beautiful 

silkscreen of the artist is created. It 
is a ucce sful combination of " the 
artist-at-work" as well as a tech-
nique for introducing the notion of 
"layering of images." It reflects 
Warhol's technique of taking ex-
i ting images and manipulating 
them to end up with his own piece 
of art. 

Similar techniques are used 
throughout the film. Warhol's 
movie are presented on a split-
screen and fast forwarded. With 
uch cinematic greats as "Sleep," 

"Eat." and "Haircut," this is quite a 
ble ing.

tion does wander, it is brought

than his suppo ed IS minutes of

effective film techniques that help 
convince us that Warhol's art and 
influence on the way we perceive 
contemporary society is inesti-

"The Long Walk Home," un-
like "Driving Mis Daisy," is not a 
feel-good movie. It is a feeling 
movie, ye - but it's more of a 
disturbing feeling, one which just 
might move you to thought and 
action. 

Like " Driving Miss Daisy," 
''The Long Walk Home" is about a 
growing friendship between a fairly 
affluent Southern woman and one 
of her servants. But rather than 
glo sing over racial tensions in the 
friend hip -with an implicit 
me sage that racism isn't a prob-
lem - "The Long Walk Home" 
jumps into the heart of the civil 
right movement, centering it 
storyline around the 1955 MOOl-
gomery bus boycott. 

Si sy Spacek is M iriam 
Thompson, a proper Southern 
housewife whose household rou-
tine i lightly upset by the bus 
boycott. Whoopi Goldberg plays 
the maid Odessa Cotter who walks 
across town to work in the 
Thompson home every day. In a 
curious reversal of roles, Miriam 
offers to drive Odessa to work, 
without her husband's knowledge. 
Miriam however does not give 
Odessa a ride not because Odessa 
is exhausted by the pedest rian 
commute, or because she supports 
the boycott, but rather because she 

is frustrated by her maid's daily 
tardines . 

Although her social crowd 
chastizes Miriam for driving ber 
"uppity" maid to work, she defends 
her a tion in the name of practi-
cality, saying she just wants her 
house cleaned - " and you know 
it's so tough to get good help these 
days." Miriam still views Odessa 
as merely a servant, failing to see 
her as a human being with a family 
of her own to take care of after 
leaving the Thompson home. 

But regardless of class differ-
ences, both Miriam and Odessa 
share similar plights as women 
pressed into submission by a racist 
and exist ociety. 

In the long run, both women 
begin to realize their potential as 
individuals - Ode sa as she qui-
etly yet passionately fights the 
powers that push her down, Miriam 
as she slowly realizes her ability 
and responsibility to help the civil 
rights movement. 

Miriam Thompson knows her 
place: to play hostess at her 
husband's dinner parties, to have a 
drink ready for him and take hi 
coat when he comes home, to take 
care of his family. But eventually 
Miriam learns to use her wifely 
wiles to her advantage- and when 
thay fail, she learns to stand up to 
her husband for her own decisions. 
Spacek has the "That's nice. dear"

Miriam's developing determina-
tion and resolve with great spunk. 

Though she is be t known for 
her exaggerated facial contortion , 
Goldberg reveals another avenue 
of ex pre sionin her role as Odessa. 
The only indication of Odes a's 
emotional state is found in the eyes, 
her face set in a stony acceptance 
of the day-to-day humiliations of 
being black. 

Now that Goldberg has finally 
gotten an Oscar for her comedic 
role in "Ghost," it's time for Hol-
lywood to face the former San 
Diego Repenory Theater actre s' 
dramatic abilities. "The Long Walk 
Home" provides Goldberg with a 
fine chance to display the power-
ful depth of her ability. And the 
rest of the cast likewise delivers 
chillingly realistic pomayalsofthe 
perpetrators and victim of racist 
attitudes in the South.

husband Norman i not exactly

nonnal: the head of the household, 
a product of his society. Becau e 
he alone brings home the bacon, he 
conde cendingly assumes his wife 
knows nothing of the "real world" 
and refuses to listen to her views 
on the "nigger" situation. He's a 
good father for rough-housing with 
the kids, but is always in c1osed-
fisted (and closed-minded) control 
of the fam ily - "Father Knows 
Best" minus the geniality. 

Odessa's family provides a 
study in the conflicts within the 
community created by the civil 
rights movement. Some, like the 
teenaged daughter Selma (Erika 
Alexander), refuse to take part in 
the movement - yet are still at-
tacked by racists despite their dis-
tance from the movement. Her 
loyal younger bro ther Theodore 
(Richard Habersham) comes to he r 
defense against attacking white 

teenagers, but then stuns them 
by receiving their blows with 
fists clenched at his side. 

The family, though 
shocked, is not surprised by 
thi e vent. In church

dal, but as an example of the 
dignity with which one can 
face interracial violence. 

The scenes set in the local 
black church hit powerfully 
with their rou sing gospel 
choruses and energetic 
preaching. The church plays a 
large role in uniting the black 
community in its boycott. 
Separation of chu rch and state 
isn't an issue here; what's at 
stake is a matter of personal 
beliefs in equality, be it in the 
home, in the workplace, on 
the roads, in the legislature. 

"The Long Walk Home" is 
rich with poignant moments 
revealing both the ingrained 
racism and humanness of the 
South in the '50s. 

On one hand there is the 
old ways of thinking: Miriam

a photo of the young Miriam 
as a child, holding her nurse' s 
hand - but the nurse's face 
and body are not even in the 
picrure, as if she were only 
important when he watched 
after Miriam. 

And on the other hand. there 
is the next generation: 
Miriam' young da ughter 
Mary Catherine (Lexi Faith 
Randall ), also quite fond of 
her maid Odessa, will hope-
fully break the patterns of rac-
ism. The grown Mary 
Catherine's retrospecti ve voice 
narrating the film, although 
somewhat distracting, does 
provide the film with hope for 
the future. 

"The Long Walk Home" 
raises important political and 
personal issues in a medium 
that usually settles for escap-
ism. The historically-ba ed 
film presents a fictional story, 
full of truth, that brings the 
Civil Rights Movement to a 
more tangible, personal level 
for the average movie-goer.

You can always tell that 
pring i in the air by looking 

at a Ticketmaster entertain-
ments guide. Major bands 
come out of the studio to tour 
whipping local radio station 
into a frenzy of hype. Satur-
day night at the Sports Arena, 
it was Sting's tum to begin 
this musical bonanza with the 
last date of his U.S. tour. 

Sting somehow manages to 
balance mU5icai experiment 
and melancholy, lyrical songs 
with the charisma and show-
man hip of a pop star. Yet 0 
far. his ambition haven't 
overreached his popularity and 
he remains in the mainstream. 

When he wa the lead 
singer for the Police, ting 
wrote ter e, catchy three-
minute pop songs that initial1y 
concentrated on romance and 
later turned to political and 
cosmological notions. 

However, since the di so-
lution of the Police in 1983-
84, his songs have moved away 
from standard bouyant radio-
fare and become increasingly 
morose. Chant-like melodies 
now usually carry sombre lyr-
ics. Most of his songs since 
1987's Nothing Like the Sun 
album are made to sink in 
slowly, improve with repeated 
listening, and not readily leap 
out of a radio speaker. 

Overall , the material i not 
standard arena fare. While 
songs such as "Why Should I 
Cry For You?" can certainly 
move an audience, in other 
material Sting seem to be 
counting on the band's inter-
play to make up for the lack of 
a real melody.

Spring No Break for Men's Tennis BASEBALL Continued from page 16 E.J. Remer led the Triton at-tack, going 2-for-3 with a two-run tri pie and catcher Anthony Sanchez 
went 2-for-4 in the 10 . By Les Bruvold 

Associat9 Sports Editor 
Spring break was no vacation 

forthe UCSD men's tennis team a 
it played ix matches in six day , 
winning four of the six including a 
pair of impre sive 7-2 victories 
over nationally-ranked lI.llT and 
St. Thomas (MN). The Tritons ran 
their overall record to 6-8, 6-2 
against Divi ion III opponents. 

The Tritons' respite from 
classe started off well, as they 
bla ted Williams College and 
Luther College 8-0 and 5-0 re-
spectively, on March 25 and 26. 

The highlight of the e two 
whitewashes was Chad Mor e's 

comeback from a 5-1 third- et 
deficit to defeat Luther's Sujay 
Lama 6-1, 4-6, 7-6. 

T h is past weekend UCSD 
traveled to compete in a biennial 
three-day gathering of top-20 Di-
vision III teams at the Case West-
ern Re erve Club in Phoenix, 
Arizona on March 28-30. The Tri-
tons came blCk from the desert 
with mixed feelings as they plit 
four matches. 

UCSD fir t faced seventh-
ranked Gu tavus Adolphu , and 
the Golden Gu ties blew past the 
Triton, weeping all six singles 
matche from the Triton . 

The Triton ' luck took a de-

cidedchange forthe better the next 
day, as UCSD took identical 7-2 
wins from MIT and St. Thomas 
(MN) respectively. 

The high point of the St. Tho-
mas match was another miraculous 
Triton third-set comeback. John 
Cro s got off the deck to overcome 
a 5-0 deficit, defeating Mall 
Marasco 6-7, 6-4, 7 -6. 

In the final match of the week-
end, UCSD fell 6-3 to top-ranked 
UC Santa Cruz. 

UCSD was able to take the top 
two singles matches as Chad Morse 
upended Greg larasitis 6-2, 3-6, 7-
6, while number two Chris Bello li 
bem Eric Oehslschlager 6-1,6-3. 

In the first game, Bryan 
Thomason scanered ix hit and 
gave up two unearned runs in seven 
and one-third innings of work. 

"Bryan pitched well but we 
couldn't get enough offense to get 
him off the hook," Yates said. 

In the day's econd con test 
against Cal Bapti t, the Tritons' 
offense showed signs of coming to 
life, as UCSD tied the game at four 
with fo ur runs in the seventh. Cal 
Baptist, however, came back with 
three in the eighth off starter Rich 
Tomolonis to seal the victory. 

"R ich pitched well early but 
just got worn out by the eighth ," 
Yates noted.

Continued from page 24 

UCSD Head Coach Doug Boyd 
had already conceded the men ' 
title before the 1991 meet even 
started. Any hopes of a champi-
onship for the Tritons would have 
had to come from the women. Hope 
quickly vanished, 

"For us to beat Kenyon, we 
would have had to swim a perfect 
meet. And I'm still not sure that 
would have been enough," Boyd 
said. 

It probably wouldn ' t. The Tri -
tons broke 13 school records, and 
beat Kenyon in the 800-yard 
freestyle relay. It was the first time 
that the Kenyon women have lost a 
relay since 1985. 

" Our women s wam great," 
Boyd said. 

Catherine Capriles led the Tri -
tons, capturing individual titles in 
the 100 and the 200 back. Jamee 
Couch broke the school record in 
the 50 free. Sabrina Lum and Erin 
Bakey each broke two school 
records. 

Boyd also noted the perfor-
mances turned in by Chrisy Parker, 
Jocelyn Rothbard , and Jenna 
Banaszek. 

What did Kenyon do? The Lords 
yawned, stretched, and then ripped 
off a meet-record 661.5 points. 

" We took 15 swimmers and five 
divers, and they had 17 swimmers 
and one diver. They had more depth 
than we did," Boyd said. 

Williams (MA) finished third, 
followed by Allegheny and f.'dlOn ' 

While the women w,te at .~t 
in the hunt for a titllr, BQ7d noted 
before and after me ~t that no 
one would be.sbleA) stay with the 
Kenyon roen. 

"NobOdvJlad a shot. There waS 
no .. ilY ""ey could lose the meet. 
rnev could have won the meet 
widl four relays getting disquali-
tied," Boyd said. 

At least pan of the difference 
could be attributed to Kenyon's 
overwhelming advantage in depth. 
The Lords brought 18 swimmers 
to Georgia. UCSD qualified only 
9, while second-place Claremont 
sent II swimmers. 

Kenyon used its advantage to 
rack up 593 points. Claremont was 
second, an unbel ievable 303 points 
behind the Lords. 

Travis Miller led the Tritons 
with a victory in the 100 back, a 
second-place finish, and three top-
four finishes on relay teams. 

Miller's time in the 100 back of 
51.41 was just one-tenth of a sec-
ond off the Division ill record, set 
in 1986 by UCSD's Bill 
Kazmierowicz. 

"[He] swam well, [but] he didn't 
swim as well as he can swim in the 
future," Boyd said 

Otherhigblights for the Tritons 
included John flowers' third-place 
finish in the 100 free after battling 
back from an assortment of season-
long injuries. 

Mark Fablen finished fout1h in 
the 500 free, and fifth in the 16~ 
free. 

In addition. the 800 free relay 
team finished second behind Hope. 

Kenyon placed third, which is 
notable only because it was the 
fU'St time that Kenyon had lost a 
relay, 

On a weekend where UCSD 
was given little, if any, chance for 
a victory, Boyd was pleased with 
the outcome. 

"Our team had just as good a 
meet as anybody, probably the best 
meet of a lot of teams," he said.

ContInued from ~ 24 
Gusties upended the Tritons 5-4 in 
last season's Division ill national 
championship match. 

The Tritons gained an early 
advantage over the Gusties, grab-
bing four of six ingles matches, 
despite losses at number one ingles 
by Robyn Inaba and number two 
singles by Carla Nicolas. 

UCSD's number three through 
six spots, however, had little trouble 
with Gustavus Adolphus as they 
swept all four singles matche . 
Janet Wahlen blitzed Molly 
McCormick 6-2, 6-1 , whi Ie Aman-
da Lynch eased past Nikki LaVoi, 
6-2, 6-4,and Catherine Yimslipped 
past Dawn Parmley 7 -6,6-1. Diane 
Chandler had relatively little 
trouble with Linnea Carlson at 
number six singles, winning 7-6. 
6-1. 

The overall match came down 
to doubles, where Lynch and 
Nancine Hayden teamed to defeat 
McCormick and Parmley 6-1, 7-5, 
clinching the victory for the Tri-
tons. 

In other doubles action, McCray 
and Rostberg defeated Inaba and 
Wahlen 6-0, 5-7, 6-3, while LaVoi 
and Carlson won by default over 
Yim and House who retired due to 
injury after dropping the first set. 

"We were ranked third in the 
nation in the preseason poll," 
UCSD Head Coach Liz La Plante 
said. "But now we've beaten both 

~'Imber one [Gustavus Adolphus] 
oqd "umber two [Pomona-Pitzer

The 1'rit"-'lS rode the wave of

match against t. 'Olaf (MN) and 
.were nearly perf~ .... inning 8-1 

"We were really ~ a 'I\igh and 
played as well as we hav .. a:t. <;ea-
son," La Plante said. 

The only match the Tritons lost 
was number two doubles. where 
Lynch and Hayden fell 7-6, 2-6,6-
3 to St. Olafs Betsy Kiemot and 
Kristen Baab. 

"The only reason we lost that 
was because Nancine has been 
huning lately with a muscle pull," 
La Plante said. 

UCSD also had a fairly easy 
time with Luther CIA), prevailing 
7-2 in a March 26 match that was 
frequently interrupted by rain. 

"We were a little rusty because 
of the weather and the fact that we 
hadn't practiced during fi nals, to La 
Plante said. "But ] thought we 
played pretty well considering."

that the tournament was delayed 
by a day and had to be moved to 
drier pastures at Imperial Valley 
College in EI Centro. Yes, EI 
Centro. That's a pretty long drive 
for some home games. 

"They dido ' t get nearly as much 
rain out there as we did, and the 
field was really in pretty good con-
dition," UCSD Head Coach Lyle 
Yates said. 

The tournament got off to an 
inauspicious start for the Tritons, 
as lona clubbed UCSD 8-1 Thurs-
day. 

"We had had no practices for 
two weeks, so I knew we wouIdn' t

Friday wasn't much better, as 
UCSD dropped two more, losing

Marshall Named Coach of the Year 
UCSD men 's basketball Head 

Coach Tom Marshall wa named 
one of eight Division In 1991 
Kodak District Coaches of the Year 
by the National Association of 
Basketball Coaches. 

Marshall was named Coach of 
the Year for the West District. 

Marshall led the Tritons to a 23-
4 record this year, and guided 
UCSD to the first postseason win 
in the program's history, a 76-72 
win over Claremont in the second 
round of the NCAA tourney. 

It was the Tritons' second con-
secutive 20-win season. In eight 
years as UCSD 's head coach, 
Marshall has posted a 125-87 
record. 

MEN'S LACROSSE 
1beUCSDmen'slacrosseteam 

defeatedMarthattanville 16-14and 
MIT 11-8 last week. 

1be Tritons, currently 8-6, also 
lost to UC Davis 18-12 on March 
28. On March 17. they trampled 
Loyola Marymount 24-2. 

Although none of games af-
fected UCSD's standing in the 
Western Collegiate Lacrosse 
League, the victories over 
Manhattanville and MIT were 
"pleasant wins," according to 
Coach Bob McCleod, who said 
that teams from the East are usu-
ally tough. 

McCleod noted the perfor-
mances of Juan Millan and Ezra 

BrIan MorrIeIGuatOian 
Tom Marshall 
Felker who "played extremely well 
last week." 

In the past two games, Millan 
scored eight goals and contributed 
five assists while teammate Felker 
added five goals and five assists. 

The highlight of the week was 
the MIT victory, according to 
McCleod. 

MIT led by four goals at the 
half, but UCSD came from behind 
to secure the win. 

CREW 
The UCSD men's crew varsity 

four lost to Loyola Marymount on 
March 16 because of a collision 
with a buoy on the course. 

"[The collision] was a strong 
contributing factor to the loss," 
Head Coach Mike Shannon said. 

LMU took advantage of the 
Tritons ' mishap to finish first in a 
time of 6:03. The UCSD "A" boat 

finished ina rimeof6: 10 to capture 
second place, while the UCSD "B" 
boat clocked in three seconds later 
for third. 

The men's novice eight de-
feated LMU in a time of 5:43.50. 
LMU finished nearly 20 seconds 
back. UCSD also dominated the 
men' s varsity eight rowing to first 
in a time of 5:30, four seconds 
ahead of the Lions. 

The UCSD women's crew var-
sity eight lost to LMU by two-
tenths of a second, fmishing in a 
time of 6:24.21. 

"LMU was a whole lot faster 
than I had anricipated," Head Coach 
Jack Vallegra said. 

In the women's novice eight, 
the UCSD "A" boat took first in a 
time of 6:31.67. LMU finished in 
6:45.57 while the UCSD "B" boat 
took third with 7:08.11. 

UCSD defeated USC in the var-
sity men's fours but lost the men's 
novice eight race on March 17 
when the coxswain became dis-
oriented and slowed the Tritons' 
boat just before the finish . 

The USC boat then glided right 
by for the victory. 

USC defeated UCSD in the 
women's varsity eight. The UCSD 
junior varsity, competing in the 
varsity race, took third. 

In the novice race, the UCSD 
"A" boat placed first USC was 
second, and the UCSD "B" boat 
finished third.

By Lea Bruvold 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball team's perfor-
mance in the UCSD Invitational Tourna-
ment took a page from last week's weather 
forecast - stonny and cold but clearing to 
sunny skies by the weekend. 

During the first two days of the three-
day event, the Tritons seemed to be in a bit 
of a post-finals fog, dropping three games 
by a combined score of 17-6, but the 
offense brightened up considerably Sat-
urday in an impressive 5-4 win over Di-
vision Ilona College (NY). 

"They're starting to play more to-
gether. If we keep up the intensity, 
we should do well," Jarrell said. 

UCSD traveled to CSU 
Hayward for the Pioneer Classic in 
which the Tritons went 2-4. But, 
according to JarrelJ, the record 
doesn't do justice to a solid per-
fonnance by the Tritons despite a 
disappointing loss to Stanford

means that California residents will 
pay $4,290 next year instead of

nation, and UCSD its most expen-

On the heels of a 40 percent fee 
increase in Febnwy, the UCRegents 
voted to move the university closer 
to the level of top-ranked, prestigious 
American universitie when they 
approved a 100 percent fee increase 
in their Friday meeting at UC Ri ver-
side. The f~ increase will go into 
effect beginning Fall Quarter, 1991. 

At UCSD, where the added costs 
of RIMAC (Re reational and Intra-
mural Athletic Complex), the Uni-
versity Center fee, and others mu t 
be factored in, the figures for the fall 
of 1991 jump from $2,384 to $4,768 
for in- tate tudent, and from 
$10,369 to $20,738 for those from 
out-of-state. 

"We have a short-term primary 
goal, and that goal is to have the best 
universities in the nation," aid Roy 
Brophy, chairman of the Board of 
Regents. "Right now, we are behind 
the school in the Ivy League. We 
need to be better than them." 

Because the regents are autono-

the state constitution, their deci ion 
to raise fees is binding and cannot be 
overriden by the state legislature.

Muir Lot Reduced by Construction 
By Uri Feldman 
ParlcJng Guy 

1be UCSD Parking Advisory Board (p AB), 
continuing with phase two of its Long Range 
Campus Parking Plan, passed a proposal last 
week that will wipe out all yellow and green 
spaces in the Muir College Parking Lot. The 
P AB vote clears the way for the construction of 
the new Administrative Services Complex on 
the site now occupied by the Muir lot. 

PAB members cited a growing need for a 
second administative complex and an over-
whelming number of automobiles on campus as 
reasons for approving the elimination. 

"It's quite simple, really," said Bob Umstead, 
manager of UCSD's Parking and Transporta-
tion Services and a member of the board. "Right 
now, there are too many cars on this campus. 
Students should learn that parking is not a right, 
it's a privilege. Now they're going to have to 
learn the hard way." 

Umstead also explained that he had been 
receiving enonnous pressure from administra-
tors - partiCUlarly from Associate Vice Chan-
cellor of Extension Mary Walshok - to build a 
state-of-the-art administrative complex with its 
very own radio station. 

According to Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Facilities, Design, and Construction M. Boone

Bul/dozers rol/ for the Muir Lot this week. 
Hellmann, the lot will be closed to students and 
staff any time this week, but it could be shut 
down as early as 3:30 p.m. today. At that point, 
any cars left in the lot will be towed. and im-
pounded. 

When construction is ftnished, Hellman said, 
the red spaces in the upper lot, reserved for 
faculty and administrators, will remain intact. 

"We've just got some minor papelWoric to

ISIS System Breaks 
Down; All Classes 
Must be Re-Added 
By Billy Batson 
In the Winnebago 

A computer error in UCSD' new ISIS student 
information system has caused the loss of student 
registration information for Spring Quarter, 1991 . 

According to UCSD Bursar Howard Fisher. the 
catastrophic error will 
require all students 10 re-
regi ter for their classes 
this quarter. 

"Fee payment infor-
mation and the list of 
registered students 
wasn't affected by the 
crash," Fisher said. "But 
students wi II ha ve to take 
add/drop cards to their 
classes during the first week of instruction." 

He indicated that individual professors and de-
partments will have different policies regarding the 
re-adding process. 

"A few departments will require all students to 
line up [forre-adding] on different days, depending 
on their class standing," Fisher said. "Others will 
simply sign add cards in class." 

The best policy for all students to follow, he 
explained, would be to find out what to do from 
individual instructors. 

"Everyone should be sure to ask their professors 
what to do about re-adding classes due to the ISIS 
crash," Fisher said. "Since many instructors were 
gone over Spring Break, they might not even know 
that the re-adding has to take place." 

According to Fisher, all students must submit 
their completed add cards by Friday, April 12. 
Then the Registrar's Office will register students 
by class standing - all seniors will be registered 
first, followed by sophomores, freshmen, and 
juniors. 

"Some might complain about the fact that jun-
iors have to register last," said UCSD Registrar 
Ron Bowker. "But the ISIS system is very strict in 
the way it does add/drops, and juniors have to come 
last in that process." 

Within classes, adding wil\ be done in alpha-
betical order by last name, according to Fisher. 

Student reaction to the re-adding process was 
mixed. 

"I can 't believe it," Revelle College juniorChri 
Zaharias said. "They said that ISIS would be a 
beuersystem, an improvement - but it isn't. They 
should bring back the old T-REG system. I liked 
the voice of the T -REG woman better anyway." 

"It'll be a pain," Muir College senior Norm 
Adams said. "But I don't see any alternative. It

Gala Opening of Shiley Sphincter 
Center Planned for Wednesday 

The newest addition to the UCSD campus, the Shiley 
Sphincter Center, will opeD its doors and expose itself to 
the public next Wednesday in a ceremony anended by 
UCSD Oumcellor Richard Atkinson and the building's 
namesake, La JoUa proctologist E. ~I Shiley. 

"We hope that researchers from around the world will 
enter the sphincter center ,n Adrinson said. "It should be a 
haven for all scientists who wish to advance the swn tocal 
of human sphincter knowledge." 

In addition to its potential for scientific achievement, 
the $58 million center building has been decl~ an 
"architectural wonder" by Architecture World magazine. 
The building, circular with a rounded courtyard in its 
center, was designed by E.A. Cavetti, the famed architect 
based in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 

"Being associated with this project fills me with nothing 
but pride," Shiley said. "It's a true advancement for all 
involved in sphinctoral science." 

Shiley, who donated $10 miUion to the project, indi-
cated hi excitement that the center is finished. 

"Many people have put their blood, spit, and stool into 
this thing," he aid. " ]\ 'S nice to finally ee something 
come out of it." 

Maurer Allegedly Performs a Task 
Though the reports remain unconfirmed, a hocking 

new discovery has been uncovered within the hallowed 
hall of the A sociated Student . It seem that AS. 
Commissioner of Public Relations George Maurer has 
actually done something. 

"I don't believe it," said AS. Pre ident John Edson, 
with his mouth agape. "George hasn' t done anything all 
year. What makes you think he'd do something now?"

Even though the event was all set to go in the Price Center Exciting Seminars SetforThls Week 
on April 12, Anderson explained that he just "could no longer 
be re ponsible for students wandering around large, open 
areas with beers. I think if we hold the event in the police 
station, all of those problems will be rectified." 

Anderson explained that if students wish to obtain a beer, 
they must line up outside the parlcing ticket pay window. After 
receiving beer from a uniformed officer, students will be led 
into a jail cell where a firing squad will supervise each and 
every srudent, making mental notes aboutamouotsand methods 
of consumption. In-Training Officer Randy Fidac will be 
gi ven full authority on when and how to shoot if the students 
get out of line, according to Anderson.

ISIS: System wiped 
Continued from page 1 
won't be too bad." 

Charging a university-wide conspiracy, new 
incinerator collective members said that they 
will protest the incident by refusing to re-register. 

"That'll show the administrators who's boss," 
said collective member Janet Beach. 

The computer crash occurred late Friday 
moming, when a student mistakenly maIked 
"Winter Quarter" on a regular course add card 
meant for Spring Quaner. According to Bowker, 
the Registrar's Office official did not check the 
card, and fed it immediately into his machine's 
card reader . 

Bowker added that the clerk involved in the 
incident was fired later that day. 

"We can't allow incompetent people to work 
university-owned equipment, no matter how 
many kids they have to feed," Bowker said . 

Fisher emphasized that despite the glitches, 
the ISIS system is at UCSD to stay. 

"There are a lot of benefits to ISIS," he said. 
"For example, it almost completely eliminates 
all work previously done by administrators in the 
Registrar's Office and Bursar's Office. 1bere 
might be some added student discomfort, but 
they'U get used to it eventually." 

LOT: Muir will go 
Continued from page 1 
off by means of a barbed-wire fence, according 
to Umstead. If the situation reaches dramatic 
proportions, be said, the parldng administration 
has no qualms about turning the fence into an 
extremely high-voltage electrical device. 

"Students can get so irate about parking," 
Umstead said. "If it comes down to it, we need to 
make sure if they try to mess with our fence, they 
will get fried. We ain't gonoa mess around. I dare 
one of them to do it." 

Umstead recommended that students and staff 
currently parked in the lot move theircars as soon 
as possible. 

Carwash • Gas Station • Dry Cleaners 
• Grocery Store. One Hour P~oto. Florist 
• PostOffice • HairSalon • Video Store • Bank 

• Restaurants • and many other retail stores. 

NEWS 3 

Fisher went on to say that the crash of the ISIS 
system was not entirely unexpected. 

"At the University of Colorado, which began 
running ISIS last year, there was a very similar 
incident. They lost the payment records for the 
entire year, forcing all students to re-pay their 
fees. It seems ISIS enjoys erasing information," 
he said, chuckling. 

Bowker,like Fisher, was very positive about 
the future of the ISIS system. 

"We can expect ISIS to take over all aspects 
of this campus," he said. "Housing fees, book-
store charges, and even bribes to campus park-
ing officials will be controlled by the ISIS billing 
system." 

When asked about possible future problems 
with the system, such as the unconfirmed report 
that one student's phone was destroyed while 
registering last quarter, Fisher was upbeat. 

"1bere won't be that many problems in the 
future, and those that do crop up will be dealt 
with," he said, adding that he feels "students are 
remarkably resilient." 

"And as for the exploded telephone last quar-
ter, all I can say is that we've dealt with the 
problem, and it won't happen again," Fisher 
said. "Besides, it was a Mickey Mouse phone. 
Don't you think a college student should have 
grown up and bought a real phone by now?" 

"Some of these kids out here ain't got no idea 
about some of them there towing lot fees," he 
said. "Man, I tell ya, they'll clean ya out. I was 
gonna have to pay 150 bucks last week down at 
Lake's Towing cuz they found my Ford Ranger 
parked in the middle of the Price Center Plaza. Of 
course, when they found out who I was, they 
returned my money." 

Umstead admitted he has his own personal 
interests in the seeing the construction of the new 
complex carried to its fruition. He explained that 
current plans for the complex include a new 
Parking Office, which means that both be and 
parking chum Howard Finnecy will have access 
to the two coveted "gold" parking spaces. The 
proposal also calls for a parking control tower.

THE ADMINISTRATION 

Thanks for the Great Party 
Whoever aid the university administration doesn't care 

about studen was eithera member of the CM Cafe collective or 
wasn't invited to the annual Guardian-Admin tmtion Gala Ball 
held last Friday. Each year, as a son of gesture of appreciation for 
reponing the news and writing pro-RIMAC editorial ,the UCSD 
administration throw out all the stops and holds an enormous 
party for the Guardian staff. 

The adrnini tration really know where and when to give 
credit when credit is due. Thi -year, the festivities were held atthe 
university-owned, beachfront Waldorf-Astoria in the Bahamas. 
Guardian staff members were flown first-class on the university-
owned MGM Grand Airlines to the Atlantic i land, where we 
were immediately ushered to a fleet of over 50 university-owned 
Ii rno ines and whisked to the hotel. Once there, we were escorted 
to the Regent 'Ballroom,located on lhetop floor, where we were 
greeted by California Governor Pete Wil on, University of 
California Pre ident David Gardner, UCSD Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, Vice-Chancellor of Undergraduate Affairs Joseph 
Watson. La Vegas entenainer Wayne NeWlon, and a host of 
others. The university spared no expense to make us comfortable. 
In a span of 48 hours, Guardian staffer and university 
admin tratol1l drank four cases of Dom Perignon, 15 bottles of 
25-year old Chevas Regal Scotch whiskey, and over 12 kegs of 
Watney's Red Barrel; we rnoked 20 boxes of university -owned 
"Havana Specials" cigars, and ate over 300 Maine Lobsters, 200 
pounds of file! mignon. and 20 chocolate rn usse cakes. 

I ndeed, had the event not been put on by the adll1ini tration for 
tuden!s, we would have almo t been tempted to write an 

editorial saying that the one million dollars spent on the event 
would have been put to better use el ewhere. But then again. it 's 
nOI that often that students-if only a few elite- are flown first 
clas to a tropical paradise and are given the opportuniry ro walch 
Chancellor Atkinson get drunk, do a handstand naked on a 
balcony 25 floors above a beach looking out at the Atlantic 
Ocean, and sing the lyrics to "She's Having a Baby." Nor is it 
everyday that the editors of a rnajoruniversity newspaper are able 
to 11 down WIth university administrators and plot way to "hit 
those granola-eaters where they live."The truth i ,wedon'tlike 
the fact that we've sold our souls to the University of Cali fomi a. 
but when it comes right down to it, we really, really like those 
Cuban cigars, and without the administration's financial uppon, 
there is ju t no way we'd be able to afford to drink two cases of 
Don Perignon a week, cspecialJy not at $3600 a case. 

On our last day in the Bahamas. Chancellor Atkinson presented 
Editor-in-ChiefPhil Gruen a check from the university's general 
unallocated fund for $25,000 to help boost the Guardian's 
sagging "Cancun Vacation Fund." The chancellor' check will 
be very helpful in sending the Guardian editors (except for 
Yamaguchi) to beautiful Cancun for two week of fun in the sun 
and lots of tho e mixed drinks in the pineapples with the little 
paper umbrellas. Thanks to Dave, Dick, Joe, Tommy, and all the 
rest for the be t party ever. See you next year in Monaco. 

NEW ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEX 

Parking Not a Student Concern 
The newly proposed administrative complex in the Muir 

Parking lot is good. Less parking is good becau e students drive 
too much. If the students don't drive because there is no parking 
that is good because it will help the environment. The admini -
tration is good because it gives us lots of money di guised as 
"advenising." The Guardian gets obscene amount of money 
from the administration because it likes us. And we like it. We can 
buy lot of cigars, and champagne, and fancy thing ,Sometimes 
we get really drunk and laugh at the granola-eaters down the hall 
because they have a puny little office and we have a really big 
office. Sometimes we smoke our Cuban cigars and throw lit butts 
off the second floor of the old, wooden student center at the people 
sleeping on the hump. It is especially funny when they jump up 
and scream, because they can '[ figure out who burned them with 
lit cigars. Then wealJ laugh and go back and produce the paper and 
drink more champagne. 

The Disreguardian Monday, April 1, 1991 

Chancel/or Richard Atkinson lives It up at the AdministrationtGuardian bash in the Bahamas. 

Armadillos and Birds are our Friends 
• The Liberals should stop conspiring against me and 
should begin loving me instead. After all, I am correct. 

Two annadillos walk into 
a bar. One annadiUo goes to 
the bartender and says, "Hey, 
bartender." And the bartender 
ays, "What'?" And the arma-

dillo says "Give me a beer." 
And the bartender take a 
baseball bat from behind the 
bar and hits the annadillo over 
it little rat-like head and has 

therodent~1Uffedandmounted 
for all the customers to sec. 
Theotherarmadilloisexpo edtoradongas,contracts 
lung cancer, and dies. 

I, Zack Vermin, am the annadi\lo. 
I know you all hate me. No, please, don't deny it. 

You all hate me. I said don't deny it. You don't have 
to worry about making me feel better. That's okay. I 
don 't need any of you .I have my little weekly column, 
and my bird, and that'S all I need. 

Well, actually, [ may not have my column much 
longer. 'There are Americans, and there are Liberals 
- but mostly there are Liberals, and they've all 
joined together in a conspiracy to have me silenced 
and sent away to a re-education camp. This paper is 
nothing more than a pack of slimy Liberals and pot-
heads, who sit around all day and plot to have me 
silenced. 

I know this because they all look at me like the 
starving Soviet bear, desperately looking for sus-
tainence. I cannot even go into the Guardian office 
anymore. 1be last time I went there, they circled me 
with tridents, and tried to make me read Liberal 
things, and take drugs which will turn me into a 
Liberal. Now I QJlI forced to disguise myself as a 
Liberal (but not for too long, because I might get 
caught by the hypno-beam) and deliver my articles 
secretly. 

1be Liberals are everywhere. Hitler was a Liberal. 
Gheogis Khan was a Liberal. Tom Metzger is a 
Liberal. You are probably a Liberal, too. Oneday you 
win know that Zaclc Vermin was right all along. We 
should have nuked the desert into glass. we should 
have nuked the Russian commie UbenIs, we abould 
have nuked Germany before they began tbeir~ 
Fourth Reid!. 

We sbould have loved Zaclc VeuniD, but we ctid 
not because we~ blind. We wereLa'berals, Ind not

work. I am a humble man, 
and I only .woo to do good. I 
am not writing for personal 
gain or glory. Oh no, [ would 
never dO that. I could not 
look at myself in the mirror. 
When I answer, sometimes 
people want to shake my 
hand, but I cannot let them, 
because it might be a Liberal 
trick to grab me and inject me 
with their Liberal drugs. So 1 

get angry and push tbern away. 
One time, the Liberals were especially tricky. 

They sent an old man, who was probably a commu· 
nist, who said be read my articles and wanted to sbake 
my hand He acted slow, and had a cane, but the cane 
was probably a gun (the Liberals are tricky), but I 
could see through his little game so I seized his cane 
and, before be could react, I beat him about the head 
and shoulders until he fell down and stopped fighting 
back. 1bat'U show you Liberals. 

I rememberoneday I was walking by the so-called 
pacifists at HUL when [ stopped to ask one of them 
why they all couldn't just be good Americans and 
support abe war, All of a sudden, they all ganged up 
on me and threw stones and tried to beat me with 
sticks but I ran away. 

Nobody loves me, but that's okay. One day the 
Real Americans li1ceRichard N"lXon, Ronald Reagan, 
and my faithful bird, "Spiro, "will rise up in arms with 
me and we will eonquer the Liberals and make them 
pay for not loving me. 

Everyone should be like my bird. My bird has 
feathers, and lives in a linlecage, and tells me things. 
My bini tells me about the Liberals and the hypno-
bea:ans and the Liberal drugs. My bini loves me. My 
bird call seeds, and sits on his perch, watching me. 
Loving me. Everyone should be like Spiro. He is a 
gooclbird. 

1 don', want you to hale me. 1 want you to be like 
Spiro and love me. I didn't mean all that stuff I said

FEES: Regents call 1 00% hike 'first step' WEDNESDAY'S A.S. MEETING IN BRIEF Allocations: 
Continued from pIIge 1 
a board member originally ap-
pointed by Govemor Ronald 
Reagan, explained thai the re-
gents are also making progress 
toward achieving their second 
goal. 

"We want this to be the kind 
of system where only the e1iteof 
the elite can afford to panici-
pate," Watkins said. "We need 
the best people in these univer-
sities that can possibly afford it, 
and if that means only the upper 
class, then so be it" 

Furtherresearch revealed that 
if the regents' second goal is 
achieved, only the regents and 
their immediate families will be 
able to afford an education in , 
the UC system. 

Brophy also indicated that 'if 
these two goals are reached, his 
much broader vision of an aris-
tocratic state in California will 
have been reached. 

"Ikind of model myself after 
KillgLouisXIV,theSunKing," 
Brophy admitted, with a gleam 
in his eye. "Life was so much 

easier in the [days before the French 
Revolution], Imagine. , . tbcpalaces, 
the fun, the frolic. You just couldn't 
beat it." 

Back at home, student unrest has 
begun to grow. Vice President Ex-
temalMoUy McKay, who had been 
leading a charge to repair damages 
done to students from the February 
increase, has vowed to abandon all 
ofber~viousefforts and take some 
serious action. 

''I'm tired of this," McKay said. 
"[The regents I always do this to the 
students. I'm going to sit out in froot 
of [Galbraith Hall1 until HeU freezes 
over." 

McKay, who shaved ber head in 
protest of the Persian Gulf War, 
indicated that she may now decide 
to rearrange her own face. 

Brophy, unaware and virtually 
uninterested in the system-wide stu-
dent concerns, explained that stu-
dents are not aware of the meaning 
behind college. 

"Oh, my silly children," he guf-
fawed, chomping on his now slob-
ber-drenched cigar. "You must un-
derstand the purpose of a quality

education. If you want it, you're 
going to have to pay for it:' 

• Funded $2,300 from General Unallocated to the "Stop Eating Spam" 
campaign of the Coalition Against Pressed Luncheon Meat. 

With that comment, Brophy 
took a heavy puff and passed the 
cigar -a Havana Special- to 
cigar-dlomping buddy and fel-
low regent WiUiam T. Bagley. 

• Funded $1 ,122 from the Media Budget to fund the New incinerator 
Collective' new publication: "Bathing: A Hegemonic Conspiracy?" 
• Funded $200 to Paul Eykamp for the "Paul Eykarnp Dating Game." 

Cookie: 
According to Brophy, some 

of the monies that will soon be 
fwmeled into the system will 
pay for the UC's new proposed 
atomic research facility in nearby 
Mira Mesa, an increase in ad-
ministrative salaries at each UC 
institution, a new, $40,000 ma-
hogany table for UC President 
David P. Gardner's office, and a 
ten-year supply of the best ci-
gars in the business formembers 
of the Board of Regents. 

• Given to George Maurer, for raising his hand before asking to go to 
the "laboratory." 

- Maynard Dimmesdale 

List 0' Fools 

Neither Bropby nor Watkins 
would comment on the brand of 
cigars; but board member 
Jeremiah P. Hallisey hoped that 
they would be Havana Specials. 

"They're really good ... 
they've got that exotic taste," 
Hallisey said ") really hated 
those Dutch Masters the students 
bought for us last year."

Baseball Balks and Slides in 1-3 Spring Break Disaster 
By Rick Rupkey 
Struggling in Florida 

Maybe it's the fact that the 
baseball team lost the bulk of its 
players to graduation last year. 
Maybe it' thefactthattheteami 
playing on a field that is only two 
years old. Maybe it' the man-
ager. Maybe it's the lackofhining. 
Perhaps the lack of defense. Or it 
could even be a complete break-
down of the pitching staff. 

But either way you slice it, the 
answer is perfectly clear: Unles 
somebody competent tart rak-
ing the mound, thi team i n't 
going anywhere. 

I f there was hope earlier in the 
season, pani ularly after two 
running up ets over Division I 

schools USD andSDSU, that hope 
is all but erased now. OverSpring 
Break, the Tritons dropped three 
of four games at the UCSD Invi-
tational Tournament in El Centro, 
and now find themselve with an 
8-13 record. 

Despite a 5-4 win over Divi-
sion Ilona on Sarurday, UCSD 
was outscored 63- 10 over the 
break and now boasts a 1-20record 
against Divi ion m team . 

"We're exactly where we want 
to be," aid Head Coach Lyle 
Yate of hi ballclub."Nowwe're 
in a position where we can really 
do some damage." 

Yate explained that the team 
has 14 gan1es remaining on its 
1991 schedule, the majority of 
which are again t Division ill 
competition. 

"If we win even half of our 
remaining games, I think we have 
anexcellentchanceatapos~n 
bid. But I think we're going to 
win all of them. Ourtearnis really 
hining its stride right now." 

Yate admined that he "had 

some concerns" about the quality of 
groundskeeping around the mound, 
and said that poor footing may have 
affected some of his pitchers' per-
formances over the break. 

"I'm going to have to look into 
who's been raking around the mound 
lately. Thi is getting ridiculous. 
The last time I looked, [Second 
baseman ErikkJ Aldridge was do-
ing a great job. Now it looks like I'm 
going to have to call for [pitcher 
Rich) Tomoloni again. He really is 
quite good at it. And he really goes 
after the mound with a lot of gu to. 
You hould see some of the things 
he can do with those rakes." 

Tomolonis. who raked around 
the mound and wiped off the bullpen 
bench for three years, has earned 
himself a spot in the starting rotation 
this season. But things- turned sour -
for Tomolonis in only his third 
starting appearance of the year in 
Friday's game- a 15-410 to Oa 
Baptist. 

In just two innings of work, 
Tomoloni was charged with II 
runs, 14 hits, ix walks, four wild 
pitche , and three balk . 

But he did record a strikeout. 
"It looked to me like he really 

had hi tuff today," Yates said. "He 
want d the ball, so I gave it to him. 
Maybe I left him out there too long." 

With Cal Bapti t out to a com-
fortable 8-1 lead in the third inning, 
things got ugly when first base 
umpire Lee Wired called lona cen-
ter fielder Willie Henderson safe on 
an attempted teal of third. 

Yates stayed on the field for 45 
minute until Wired ejected him, 
explaining that UCSD was going to 
lose anyway. He spenttherest of the 
game trying to watch the game from 
beyond the outfield fence, until a 
security guard potted him and 
kicked him off the property. 

IRAAC Suggests Division I Move 
By Barry SwItzer 
Clean Living Consultant 

UCSD's Intercollegiate and 
Recreational Athletics Advisory 
Committee (IRAAC) surprised ev-
erybody last week when it an-
nourlCed that the UCSD athletic 
program would jump all the way to 
Division I rather than make a man-
datory five-year stay in Division II. 
Up to this point, nobody out ide of 
lRAAC's seven voting members 
and its small number of ex-officio 
members had any idea what decision 
would be handed down. 

"This is entirely unacceptable," 
said Judy Sweet, UCSD's athletic 
director and an ex-officio member 
of IRAAC. "I'm going to tum the 
tables on [lRAAC's decision) when 
they try to bring this up to the 
NCAA." Sweet is the president of 
the NCAA. 

IRAAC Chair Diana Marquardt 
said that Wednesday's meeting was 
hotly contested, adding that the de-
cision to move to Division I passed 
by a 4-3 margin. 

"It's about time," said Derek 
Armstrong, UCSD's men's soccer 
coach and a strong proponent of the 
Division I move from the begin-
ning. ". know we can beat aU the 

teams that play in Division I al-
ready." 

The decision does have to be put 
before the NCAA, but Marquardt 
indicated that Sweet does not have 
the power she thinks she does. 

"That's [NCAA Executive Di-
rector Dick] Schultz's job," she said 

Nei ther Marquardt nor any other 
member of IRAAC, however, had 
any idea where the money to fund 
such a program was going to come 
from. 

"I figure we'l1 steal it," said 
Housing and Food Services Man-
ager Lany Barrett, who moonlights 
as an IRAAC member. "I steal food 
from the cafeteria all the time. I 
think I know how it can be done." 

Barrett was observed working 
out orne under-the-table deals to 
obtain the money with Sports In-
formation Director Bill Gannon, but 
nothing can be proven. 

"Hey ,look," Gannon said. "All. 
know is what's in front of me. And 
right now, nothing's in front of me. 
I think I left everything in the office. 
Besides, the Times bas everything I 
gave them. You should have what 
they have," 

Gannon added that he bad no

Triton Baseball Coach Lyle Yates can almost count his team's 
wins for the season with the balls he holds in his hands. 

"I can't believe the umpiring in 
this league," Yates said, still hopping 
mad two hours after the game. "This 
has happened time and time again. 
I'm playing this game under protest. 
The league office is going to have to 
learn who they're dealing with." 

Yates, nevertheless, remains op-
timistic about the team's chances. 

"We're heading up to Whittier 
[on Tuesday], and we're putting 
[Kevin] Hathaway on the mound." 
he said. "When this guy gets it go-
ing, nobody can touch him, He can 
get his fastball moving in the low 
60s. You should see it." 

The Tritons will then return home 

to host Christ College of Irvine, a 
national powerhouse, on 
Wednesday. 

The time of the game was 
announced earlier this week, but 
Sports Wormation Director Bill 
Gannon did not have the infor-
mation. 

"Call the Union. I think they 
have it," Gannon said. "They only 
have what I gave them, and I 
think that's what I gave them. But 
I can't remember it off-hand. I 
think I left it at home." 

Gannon also said that he had 
no idea about the status of Triton

LEFf NOS~ pick 'em RIGHT NOSTRIL 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... Well, it's down to the wire. The left 
nostril has won the last five consecutive contests, and is still 
leading the league with a50-22crusty-booger-to-snot-picked 
ratio, But with the streak of six successfully picked boogers 
in the last six anempts, the right nostril is hanging in there 
with a 47 -25 booger-to-snot-picked-ratio.1be right no~tril is 
counting on the left nostril's failure to grab hold of a crusty 
booger on the first anempt and go with it, and if things get 
tense, it may be considering the tricky loogey maneuver. The 
left nostril has been noted to fend off the maneuver in recent 
confrontations, particularly with its use of the bloody drip 
defense. What this all means is that I am so confused, I have 
no idea what I'm going to pick. Maybe I'll pick them both at 
the same time. Or maybe not. Oh, Hell, PHIL SA YS ...
