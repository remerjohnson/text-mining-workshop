A.S. members 
take office

them a standing ovation after their last 
numb6r, "Wild Thing." The group plays

The new A.S. council members 
eased into their positions in a 
generally smooth meeting last 
night, despite some confusion 
over the rules of order. 

A.S. President Maynard 
Dimmesdale attributed the con-
fusion to the new council's inex-
perience with the jargon used at 
meetings. "We know where we 
are going; as far as how we're 
going to get there, we will be 
learning that in the next few 
weeks ... ," Dimmesdale said. 

In old council business, the 
allocation of $1,558 for co-spon-
sorship of the Crime Prevention 

Program was ammended to an 
allocation of $779 because the 
University Center Board has 
agreed to finance half of the cost. 
The Crime Prevention Program 
had originally planned to dis-
tribute key chains with emergency 
numbers printed on them to next 
year's incoming freshmen . Out-
going Commissioner of Co-ops, 
Enterprises and Services Johnny 
Patterson suggested printing 500 
business cards with emergency 
numbers, as a less costly alter-
native to the key chains. Patterson 
estimated the cost of the cards to 
be $78.50. The council then voted 
to withdraw the ammendment to 
allocate $779 to the key chain

Despite its Division III status 
and lack ofa football team UCSD 
may yet win a Bowl game. 

After squeaking past Berkeley 
in the last 15 seconds of the April 
16th regional College Bowl finals 
with a final score of 220 to 215, 
UCSD's academic trivia team 
will compete in the College Bowl 
national championships in 
Chicago over Memorial Day 
weekend . 

"We came up with the right 
answer just as time ran out," said 
Alan Hudosh, a Warren political 
science major and College Bowl 
team member for two years. 

Just as in an athletic com-
petition, fast reflexes and a cool 
head are crucial to the game. 
Two four-man teams go head to 
head in two seven-minute rounds 
during which ten point toss-up 
questions can be answered by 
any team member who "buzzes 
in" first. If a question is answered 
correctly the team gets a chance 
to confer on a bonus question, 
worth ten to thirty points. 

"Andrew Kahng [the team 
captain] has a really good ability 
to pick out who really knows the 
answer on the [bonu questions]," 

said George Wittenberg, a grad-
uate student in biology and a 
College Bowl team member for 
two years. "He'll hear three 
different answers from team 
members and he's good at picking 
out the person with the most 
commitment. "

major and a member of UCSD's

Three UCSD faculty members elected 
to National Academy of Sciences 

Three UCSD professors have been elected to 
membership in the National Academy of Sciences, 
one of the highest honors for any American scientist. 

They are Joseph Kraut, professor of chemistry; 
George N. Somero, professor and chairman of 
marine biology at Scripps Institution of Oceano-
graphy; and Russ E. Davis, professor of oceano-
graphy at SIO. 

Their election brings UCSD's total academy 
membership to 49 (48 U.S. members plus one for-
eign associate). The ratio of academy members to 
total faculty is one of the highest in the country. 

"I am extremely proud of the continued recogni-
tion given to the faculty of UCSD," Chancellor 
Richard C. Atkinson said. "This is a great testimony 
to the quality of the people that arc associated with 
this institution." 

In all, seven new University of California 
members were elected at the academy's 125th annual 
meeting in Washington, D.C., bringing the system-
wide total to 239. In addition to three new UCSD 
members, two each were elected from the Berkeley 
and Davis campuses. 

The La Jolla Marathon to delay 
on campus tramc on May 7 

The BMW La Jolla Marathon will be held this 
Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m. Because the race will be 
run on campus, traffic delays in certain areas are 
expected to occur during the race. The main areas to 
be affected include the Warren Apartments, Pry tel 
Field, Third College parking lots, the entrance to 
Revelle College via Mandell Weiss, and Gilman 
Drive near the Bio-Med .Library. Old Miramar 
Road will also be closed, as well as the Peterson 
Hall parking lot. 

The American Poetry Association 
sponsors contest 

The American Poetry Association has doubled the 
prize value of its public poetry contests. Now 
$10,000 in prizes will be awarded to 151 poets in 
each of two contests this year. There will be two 
grand prizes of $1,000. Contest entry is free. 

"There are many new, unrecognized poets writing 
today. We want to discover and encourage them," 
said John Frost, chief editor of the association. 

Interested poets should send up to five poems of 
no more than 20 lines each, with name and address 
on each page to: American Poetry Association, 
Dept. CN-5 1,250 A Potrero Street, P.O. Box 1803, 
Santa Cruz, CA 95061-1803. The current contest 
accepts poems up to a postmark date of June 30, 
and awards prizes by August 31. 

The next contest opens July I, and poems arc 
accepted until December 31, with prizes awarded by 
February 28. 

Early entry improves a poet's chances of being 
invited to other AP A contests, which besin in late 
spring and fall. The invitational contests are also 
entry free and also offer $1,000 grand prizes.

While the pace is fast and the 
pressure intense, "It really is a 
friendly competition," Witten-
berg said. "It's not a contact 
sport. " 

But it is still a game that teams 
want to win and this year's 
competition was marked by an 
incident that could have hap-

Queen Victoria's sons? 
"Berkeley buzzed in first and 

got it wrong - they answered 
'Prince Edward Island,"' Hudosh 
said. 

After giving the right answer, 
"Alberta," UCSD correctly an-
swered two ten-point bonus 
questions about vandalized 
works of art, thereby winning 
the regional championship. 

While disappointed about not 
getting to play Stanford, winning 
against Berkeley was great, 

Wittenberg said, especially as 
the placard UCB put in front of 
their team read simply 'Cal. '''Like 
they're the Univenity of Calif-
ornia. You feel a little like the 
young upstart campus against 
the older one," Whittenberg 
finished . 

And on May 27 these young 
upstarts will go against the still 
older competitive teams of 
Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, 
Georgetown, and Emory. 

"1t11 be a tough competition," 

Wittenberg said. "I'd be happy if 
we even won one match." 

One thing the team had to 
contend with was getting enough 
money to go to Chicago. While 
athletic teams get at least some 
funding for travel expenses, 
College Bowl is not a "sport" and 
therefore the Bowl team has to 
fund its own trips. Hudosh had 
said that there are many sources 
open to them for funding and 
that the team hoped the admi-
nistration would "see its way

clear to funding us." 
"I feel that the administration 

would be happy to fund us and 
see us compete on a nlltional 
level. The Chancellor is always 
espousing the virtues of UCSD 
and I think he'd be glad to see us 
compete nationally," Hudosh had 
stated. 

Kahng was not as optimistic 
as his teammate. "I'd rather not 
get into that . Relations with the 
administration are so shaky," he 
said.

event. Region 15, which com-
prises Hawaii, California and 
Nevada, held the original com-
petition in late February in San 
Jose, but due to a conflict over 
some of the questions, the April 
16th rematch was scheduled. 

Collese Bowl competition is 
set up in double elimination 
format and in the original 
competition Berkeley was 
matched against Fresno State, 
with Stanford against UCSD. 
UCSD's team was the only one 
of the four who had not lost a 
round. 

At that time protests were 
lodged with the Region 15 College 
Bowl coordinator regarding 
Stanford's use of some of the 
questions. Every team is given 
old questions with which to study, 
and on the second day of compe-
tition it was apparent that 
Stanford team members had 
simply memorized the questions 
and were able to buzz in and give 
the answer even before the 
questioner had finished posing I 
the question. According to 
Kahng, Stanford "just whaled 
on Sunday." 

A rematch was ' planned in 
which Fresno State, Berkeley, 
and Stanford were to compete 
against each other to play in the 
final round against UCSD. 

Displeased with this decision, 
however, Stanford pulled out of 
the competition, and Berkeley 
went on to beat Fresno State and 
play against UCSD in the cham-
pionship round. 

Down by 25 points at the end 
ofthe second round, UCSD and 
Berkeley were asked the follow-
ing question: which Canadian

Hunter S. Thompson 
Jackson Is Real 

.. His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him 
to run. though not to soar. "-Macaulay. On John Dryden 

I t was long before midnight when they put the fork in Jesse Jackson last Tuesday. The sun was still going down over Central Park when Jesse's wild dream hit the wall. It was all over by 10: 15 
p.m., when Jesse was in a 53-33 percent hole after 60 percent of the 
vote had been counted. The Black Prince of Main Street had been 
jerked up by his roots . There was no way to beat numbers like that. 

Meanwhile, the Mike Dukakis Special - they called it the Greek 
Hummingird - rolled out of Penn Station with plenty of empty 
seats. It was. mainly a Harvard crowd, headed south toward Philly 
and Scranton and Pittsburgh, and then west across the Alleghenies 
to Ohio, Indiana and all the way to California, where the Greeks 
planned to wrap things up. Then, back east again to Washington, 
victory and tbe magic gates of the White House. 

Jesse Jackson was not aboard. He stayed back in New York for 
some dental work. They had pulled most of his teeth a few days 
earlier, and he was not in a mood to travel. 

The Jackson Crusade went on the rocks in New York last week. It 
had been running at top speed for something like 16 or 17 months, 
fueled mainly by the madness of the candidate - a 47-year-old 
preacher from the Wrong Side of Clark Street in Chicago with a 
distinctly black cast to his skin color and an agressively radical bent 
in his own politics. 

I t was clearly strange, people said, that Jesse could be running for president at all . He was mean and crazy and nobody west of Libya seemed to have any real love or even a mild affection for 
him, but somehow he was still in the race - one of only two 
Democratic candidates to survive the curse of the seven dwarfs and 
half a decade of relentless campaigning for the most powerful job in 
the world, or maybe even the history ofthe world . The president of 
the United States has leverage beyond the wildest dreams q( the 
Caesars: he can have the head ofthe Mafia locked up; he can have the 
pope seized in airports for issuing bad checks; he can reduce whole 
nations to smoking rubble with a quick telephone call; and he can run 
up bills so huge as to boggle the eyes of even Colombian dope lords, 
crazed rajahs and the diamond kings of South Africa. 

So it was weird - genuinely and extremely weird - to run down a 
sheet of hard numbers on the Democratic presidential campaign last 
week with the primaries creeping into the home stretch and the GOP 
nomination already locked up and see the Rev. Jackson as not just a 
totem or a challenger for the Democratic nomination, but as 
something very close to a certified, genuine front-runner . . .. He had 
already won more than half a dozen states, including bastions of 
white dominance in the northeast like Delaware and Michigan (and 
yes: New York City, by the time the dust settled), and if you believed 
what the pros were telling each other, Jesse Jackson was on the very 
real brink of getting himself formally nominated as the Democratic 
Party's official candidate for the presidency of the United States. 

It was no fluke , no queer Liberatarianjoke. Jesse was for real, and 
the others - the rich people and the fat boys - were sitting around 
in the graveyard with the game plans and their hubris and their dead 
animals heaped like rancid eggs all around them ... 

T he long gray spring is over now. The "Big Apple"turned out to be j ust another version of the one that got stuck in Gregor's back in Kafka's " Metamorphosis." Deadly rotten. Fatal. A 
wrong and ugly thing for the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who finally bit the 
bullet he's been waiting for all these wild and speedy months. 

Meanwhile, back in Albany, Mario Cuomo was still pacing the 
sidelines, like Al Davis, waiting to pounce. He has been all along like 
a wolf stalking sheep. He is the last of the power players as the 
Democrats prepare nervously for the coming war against George 
Bush. But the smart money is not so impressed with Cuomo as it was 
back in Iowa and New Hampshire, in the time of the seven dwarfs . 

The new numbers on Cuomo are about 13 to I, compared to 8 to I 
on Dukakis and 4 to I on Bush, who lives from day to day with no 
opposition and nothing to worry about except when he finally has to 
explain his own role in the Iran-contra affair. He is like Alfred E. 
Neuman, who is dead now. But his spirit will live forever, or at least 
until election day in November. 

George Bush is the guiltiest man in American politics, except 
possibly for Attorney General Ed Meese (with the help of his wife, 
Ursula .) The other kingpins of the "Reagan Revolution" are gone 
now. Michael Deaver, the party animal who loved Nancy, is headed 
for federal prison on a perjury rap. And Lyn Nofziger, the one-man 
brain-trust and Reagan 's most trusted pol itical adviser c.-ver si nce his 
salad days in Sacramento, was recently sentenced to a prison term for 
criminal fraud that will keep the old gang intact. The real odds on 
George Bush moving into the White House are more like 33 to I . 

Bush is a monster like the others, and Jesse Jackson , currently a 
2-to- 1 favorite to succeed Meese as attorney general in January of 
'89, will dance on all their graves. 

Letters 
'Detective' 
Responds 
Editor: 

In the interest of objective 
truth, there are a few points I 
would like to make regarding 
your recent commentary ["April 
wasa Tough Month for Stoners," 
Guardian, May 2]. 

First of all, I was incorrectly 
identified as a "police detective. " 
In reality, I am a Muir senior 
majoring in microbiology who 
happens to have a part-time job 
as a student dispatcher for the 
UCSD Police Department. 

Basically, the position is that 
of a glorified receptionist. I am 
not a police detective, and I hope 
to God I shall never become one. 
I made it quite clear to you that I 
was not a spokesman for the 
police, and that you should call 
back and speak to the sergeant 
responsible for the particular 
shift the night of April 22, some-
thing you never did. 

Second, the fact is that each 
complaint call is documented. 
Had you taken the time to con-
sult the duty sergeant to whom I 
referred you, you could have 
been told the exact time and 
number of each call. 

I agree with your point about 
the need for a more tolerant 
stance on campus concerts. As a 
student, I have been to too many 
concerts and festivals shut down 
due to complaints from our good 
neighbors - a trend that seems 
to be increasing in recent years. I 
also must admit that at times I 
find the police presence on this 
campus annoying, distasteful and 
unnecessary. The reggae concert 
at the Chef may have been one of 
those times. I don't know; I was 
not there. 

I understa nd it is futile to 
expect any media to live up to 
the rights and responsibilities im-
plied by the First Amendment. 
Nonetheless, it is quite depress-
ing when one is personally con-
fronted with the failure of jour-
nalism to live up to one of its 
fundamental tenets - protection 
from tyranny through illumina-
tion and enlightenment. Truth 
and accuracy become clouded 
when one has a passion, and a 
commentary without passion is

not worth writing. I agree with 
much of what you wrote. I only 
wish you could have been a bit 
more persistent in the truth and 
accuracy departments. 

My friends had quite a laugh 
over my identification as a police 
detective. Fortunately, they 
know me well enough to compre-
hend the irony of the situation. 
Farfrom being a "narc, ""snitch" 
or "busybody," I am an avowed 
advocate of personal freedom at 
this university. Although I myself 
can appreciate the unint-ntional 
humor, I nonetheless feel victim-
ized by the haphazard and irre-
sponsible actions of a well-mean-
ingjournalist out to write a good 
commentary. 

Incidentally, I have a Califor-
nia version of "Dear Mr. Fan-
tasy" with the Hey Jude coda as 
early as ApriI14,1984(lrvine). 1t 
was the best Dead show I've ever 
seen. 

Jeffrey J. Haddock 

Editor's note: 'The author of 
the commentary to which Had-
dock is referring was written by 
Jeff Beresford-Howe. His reply: 

(I) When I called the campus 

police department, Haddock did 
in fact idemify himself as a 
spokesperson for the depart-
ment; I garbled the I D and had 
him down as a detective, for 
which I apologize. 

(2) While each complaint to 
the department is in fact docu-
mented evemually including 
noise complaints. if the police 
are closing down a concert they 
presently have no way of telling 
organizers of the conc''"t how 
many complaints they received, 
where the' were from or when 
they I .ppcmed until at least a 
day after the concert. 

(3) I did not take the trouble to 
call the sergeant on duty because 
Haddock told me that he was 
available only after midnight. 
Further, Haddock represented 
his account as taken from an 
account filed by the sergeant. 

(4) Haddock mayor may not 
be a "narc," "snitch" or "busy-
body;" those referenced in the 
commentary were to an anony-
mous student who called in 
complaining about a dope dealer 
in the Main Gym locker room, 
not Haddock.

T-SHIRTS FOR THE FIRST 100 PATRONSI AND A FREE POSTER FOR EVERYONE WHO ATTENDSI 

'Dukakis jor President' rally 
Continued from paat I 

as 1:30 the 
site was already crowded with 
attendees, including many people 
vying to be delegate-candidates 
for Dukakis. Over 350 people 
attended the caucus, including 
those on the ballot; this turnout 
was much higher than normal 
for a caucus of this sort. 

The 41st district is aUoted five 
delegates and two alternates to 
the Democratic National Con-
vention. Based on the vote in the 
primary on June 7th, a certain 

Jackson 
Continued from paat I 
campaign in San Diego, and is 
involved in projects which work 
to promote voting and voter 
registration on campuses. There 
are 150 student volunteers on 
this campus helping to register 
voters before May9, the deadline 
for primary registration. The 
group also distributes infor-
mation about Jackson and con-
ducts fund raisers. 

Barbara Waters, assistant dean 
of Third Collese, was also chosen 
as the fifth delegate to the con-
vention. Other delegates include 
Polly Irene Doyle, an employee 
of the UCSD Medical Center, 
and Floyd Morrow, who is run-
ning for mayor. 

proportion of those delegates will 
go to each of the two remaining 
candidates for the Democratic 
nomination. 

The purpose of the caucus 
Sunday was to determine which 
seven of the 52 people on the 
caucus ballot would be the official 
candidates eligible to fill those 
delegate and alternate positions; 
the vote Dukakis receives in the 
primary will determine how many 
of those seven will represent 
Dukakis at the convention. 

Although not all 52 people on 
the caucus ballot attended, there 

Jackson delegate Joe Wainio 

were enough there to make for 
intense political competition. The 
candidates tried to talk to each 
attendee of the caucus; campaign 
flyers and signs were everywhere. 

In accordance with the caucus 
rules, the doors to the auditorium 
were locked at 3 pm. A letter 
from Dukakis was read, and the 
attendees were briefly introduced 
to each of the prospective dele-
gate-candidates by the convener, 
Ed Butler. Because of the large 
number of candidates, speeches 
were not allowed, something 
which several people later com-
plained about. 

Following the introductions, 
voting took place, each attendee 
voting for up to seven of the 52 
names on the ballot. After the 
voting, the attendees dispersed, 
leaving only a dozen or so people 
to wait for the results. About an 
hour and a half later, the count 
was finally completed. 

The top seven finalists who are 
now eligible to become delegates 
or alternates for Dukakis, depend-
ing on the vote in the primary, 
are as follows: I) Lynn A. Schenk, 
2) Martin Block, 3) Lucy Killea, 
4) R. Steven Pope,S) Gladys E. 
Palast, 6) Bob Glaser, and 7) 
Vickie E. Foster. Daniel F . 
Kripke, the UCSD Medical 
School professor who is running 
for Congress from the 41st dist-
rict, came in 10th. The total 
number of ballots cast was 364.

Faculty affirms the need for 
broader ethnic studies 
Editor's note: This article is part 
two of a two-part series on Asian 
American Studies. Part one ap-
peared in last Monday's edition. 

By DENNIS WOO 
St~ Wrlt~ 

In October 1986, Ticho ap-
pointed the Advisory Committee' 
on Asian American Courses 
(ACAAC), which Lin agreed to 
chair. It includes other distin-
guished faculty such as linguist ' 
Matthew Chen, sociologist Rich-
ard Madsen, Masao Miyoshi of 
the literature department, histor-
ian John Dower, and Tracy 
Strong from polical science. 

Math professor James Lin 
didn't realize that Asians had 
made so many contributions to 
the United States. He learned a 
lot sitting in on visiting lecturer 
Ling-Chi Wang's Asian 
American Studies course offered 
through the history department 
in 1983. 

After taking that course, "I 

ACAAC put forth a proposal 
for a minor program in Asian 
American Studies to the Com-
mittee on Educational Policy 
(CEP), which advises Ticho. The 
proposal g3thered wide-spread 
port from students, the commun-

assistant dean of Student Sup-
port Services at Oberlin College, 
that was particularly expressive. 
" .. .it may be helpful in your 
deliberation to understand the 
intensity behind the clamor of 
Asian American Studies. While 
you may regard Asian American 
Studies as a relatively trivial 
matter within your scheme of 
institutional priorities, many of 
us place Asian American Studies 
at the top of our collective agenda 
because it represents the institu-
tionalization of a cultural lifeline 
for us. It is not just another 
academic discipline whose value 
is to be weighed against other 
institutional priorities. The fight 
for Asian American Studies is a 
struggle to reshape institutions 
to do the job of understanding, 
preserving and extending the rich-
ness of our heritages in the 
United States." 

Prof. James Lin has played a key role in the attempt to establish an 
Asian American studies program. 

"Racism ... is no longer overt discrimination against 
the Asian American faculty or other faculty of color. 
But. '. we are still denied any power within the 
political structure of the university." 

-Professor Sucheng Chan 

dressed up like I was not a profes-
sor," he said, and sat in on 
freshman history courses. 

"I wanted to compare what 
Ling-Chi said versus what they 
said about immigrant history in 
the basic courses at UC San 
Diego. I heard things like, 'The 
Japanese did not resist the intern-
ment .' I heard that the Chinese 
had made some contribuitons. 
And then I watched a slide-show 
on Japanese picture brides. And 
that was the whole content of a 
course that was supposed to 
cover the immigrant history of 
Asians in the U.S.," Lin said. 

Since that time, Lin has been a 
key player in the attempt to 
establish Asian American 
Studies at UCSD. 

Asian American Studies 
course offerings ha ve been spora-
dic, explains Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Harold Ticho. 
"For a number of years, we 
brought in visitors ... to provide 
some courses in the Asian Ameri-
can area, but it became obvious 
around two years ago that that's 
a very inefficient system . . . you 
have to look each year for new 
people. It was becoming clear 
that what we needed was some 

ity, and faculty at UCSD and 
from other colleges. Endorse-
ments came from Congress repre-
sentatives Jim Bates and Norman 
Mineta, Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, UC Regent Yori 
Wada, and others. 

Lin pointed out a support 
letter written by Tommy Woon, 

Following an Asian American 
Studies Committee presentation 
and a CEP review of the pro-
posal, the education committ~ 
sent a letter to Ticho in March. 
The letter states: "We have deter-
mined that the field of Asian 
American Studies is an extemely 
vibrant and promising field of 
research. In the fields of history, 
sociology, and the arts, Califor-
nia has rich, untapped resources 
to be explored. With broad sup-

solid foundation in that area." Shoon Lio is a member of the Asian American Studies committee 

port not only from Asian Ameri-
can students, but from other 
minority organizations and from 
general student interest ... now 
is an ideal time to mount a 
serious effort in this area. 

"CEP believes that any viable 
program in this area, however, 
will need strong administrative 
support. We recommend allo-
cating at least three FTE's (full-
time employees) to launch Asian 
American Studies. One FTE at 
the tenure level, one junior ap-
pointment, and one floating line 
for visitors would be the mini-
mum. Past experience in other 
ethnic studies programs at UCSD 
has taught us that the success of 
such programs depends upon the 
faculty recruited and the support 
they are given. 

"We do not believe that the 
long discussion on this point has 
been fruitless: we have come to 
understand that Asian American 
Studies is not a political issue. 
The program should be estab-
lished because it addressed genu-
ine intellectual issues and has 
established itself as a promising 
field of research in the social 
sciences, humanities, and the 
arts, one that can take advantage 
of vast linguistic and cultural 
resources especially in Califor-
nia. We at UCSD are overdue in 
responding to the intellectual 
challenge." 

Since March, funding has been 
earmarked for a single faculty 
member to teach Asian American 
Studies. 

Professor Sucheng Chan, who 
taught Asian American Studies 

A CAREER 

this past winter quarter, is wary 
of how monies are allocated. 
Speaking at a conference entitled 
Asians in Higher Education at 
Oakland in November, 1987, she 
said, "When my appointment 
was arranged, I said to them, 
'Look, it's costing you a lot of 
money: $16,333 for a one quarter 
visitation. Why don't you take 
this same amount of money,' I'm 
saying this to the Academic Vice 
Chancellor, 'and hire someone 
for the whole year?'" 

The reply, she said, was, "'Oh, 
we don't want a junior faculty. 
They will have a hard time here. 
It's the senior faculty that we 
want. They have already made a 
reputation for themselves.' Blah, 
blah, blah and all this stuff." 

"Racism, as I see it, is no 
longer overt discrimination 
against the Asian American 
faculty or other faculty of color. 
But what it comes down to is that 
we are still denied any power 
within the political structure of 
the University. It doesn't do 
much good if you're the only 
faculty of color ... you really 
cannot do a great deal. Or if 
you're the token person on this 
and that," Chan said. 

Chan perceived a problem in 
having no department to house 
Asian American faculty, though 
funding might be set aside. 
"When you simply exert pressure · 
against the administration, in a 
sense, it's a misdirected effort. A 
lot of the power within the UC 
system really resides in depart-
ments, around faculty. And I

Six U CSD Alumni: Writing 
on the edge of reality Research 

Assistants! Associates 
By ROBERT LEONE 
S~"/fN St,.u Wrlt~r 

UCSD educate9 doctors, en-
gineers, political scientists, and 
even science fiction and fantasy 
authors. Six otherworldly scribes 
have gotten degrees from this 
Univenity, and some of them 
have returned the favor by giving 
their alma mater a mention in 
their books. 

K.im Stanley Robinson earned 
his B.A. and Ph.D. in literature 
here. As a science fiction-fantasy 
writer, Robinson said that his 
impetus to write science fiction 
comes in part from UCSD itself, 
due to a "high-powered, state-of-
the-art literature department in a 

Kim Stanley Robinson 

high-powered science mega-
school." Robinson claims that 
his roommates during his first 
two years at UCSD were all 
science majors . He describes 
himself as a "science groupie." 

Gregory Benford, who earned 
his Ph.D. in physics from UCSD 
and is currently a professor of 
physics at UC Irvine as well as a 
"hard" science fiction writer, is 
arguably the most renowned of 
the crop of six, especially for his 
1979 Nebula award-winning no-
vel Timescape, which is partly 
set at UCSD in the eaTly '60s. 
When asked about how UCSD 
could produce six genre writers 
Benford said, "My guess is that it 
has been the conspicuous, high-
quality new campus in the United 
Stales and has, therefore, at-
tracted more imaginative minds." 

When asked how science fic-
tion had affected his academic 
career, Benford said it had not 
made much difference. "Some 
scientists, usually the least imagi-
native, have held that doing 
anything besides science impedes 
science," Benford said. Benford, 
who took two yean at UC Irvine 
to obtain tenure, supposes that 
the stigma of being a science 
fiction writer would be greater in 
an English department. 

Suzette Haden Elgin, who 
earned her Linguistics Ph.D. 
here, said, "I am a writer who is a 
scientist ... She explained, "What 
science fiction lets you do is 

propose a hypothesis and then 
explore how it would develop; 
explore it as a scientific ex-
periment. You can not do that in 
mainstream fiction or detective 
stories in the same fashion ." 

While a graduate student at 
UCSD, Elgin began writing "be-
cause I was a woman with a 
number of small children and 
didn't have enough money for 
my tuition." As she researched 
the writing field, Elgin "dis-
covered there arc two ways to 
make money in writing." One 
way is to have blind luck and 
write a best-seller. The other is to 
write a series in a genre. 

"I realized very quickly that 
the only thing[amongthe various 
literature genres] I possibly could 
write was science fiction. I'm not 
capable of doing a romance, a 
gothic, a horror book, a detective 
story." Elgin, who often uses 
feminist themes in her work, 
describes herself as a "soft" 
science fiction author. 

Why six science fiction authors 
from UCSD? "If you were to 
look in the same way at people 
who had graduated from MIT or 
Harvard or Berkeley or any major 
university you would probably 
find that half a dozen or more of 
them had become science fiction 
writers, .. said Elgin.

communications from UCSD 
and is a former Muir Assistant

UCSD-grown Sci-Fi writers 
Continued from page 9 
Resident Dean. Thi fantasy and 
horror author has taught science 
for 25 years and believes that 
because many science fiction 
writers are, in fact , scientists, a 
crop of six authors was only 
natural. "The only thing [the 
writers from UCSD] have in 
common is that we're effective 
communicators," he said. 

Feist's best-known work, the 
Rijrwar Saga, are a series of 
novels set in a "world" called 
Midkemia that was originally 
developed as a "playing environ-
ment" for that now-extinct 
UCSD student organization, the 
infamous Triton Wargaming 
Society which, according to for-
mer member Conan laMotte, 
was created "because we were 
bored and La Jolla was closed 
after 7 pm." 

Rich Spahl, also a former 
member of Triton Wargaming, 
said that Triton members used to 
hang out in POP, at Muir, when 
it was a peer counseling center

called "Page One." Feist walked 
in one day, met two Triton War-
gamers talking about their Mid-
kemia playing campaign and 
"came back Friday night with a 
new continent." LaMotte com-
mented that the parts of Mid-
kemia that Feist uses in his novels 
are not the parts that he created. 

Vernor Vinge, with a Ph.D. in 

Mathematics from UCSD, con-
siders writing a skill that is related 
to planning lectures. He said, "I 
was always a reader of science 
fiction. As a child I always tried 
to write some." Vinge, who met 
Benford at UCSD when they 
both were graduate students, 
accounted for all six writers

keep telling students, 'Go and 
hassle your faculty .. . ' The 
Chancellor can allocate .. , 
faculty positions. But it is still up 
to the departments to decide to 
hire certain minority faculty." 

Still at issue are the "Ten-Year 
Plans," the long range depart-
mental goals at UCSD. Some 
backers of Asian American 
Studies feel departments will be 
reluctant to hire Asian American 
Studies specialists because it will 
displace hiring other types of 
faculty. No additional positions 
beyond those outlined in the 
Ten-Year Plans will be allocated 
especially for Asian American 
Studies specialists, according to 
Ticho. 

The opening for tenured or 
tenured-track faculty to teach 
Asian American Studies at 
UCSD is currently being ad-
vertised in academic journals. 
Deadline for applications is Nov-
ember I, 1988.

Sci-Fi 
writers 
Continued from page 10 
coming from UCSD by stating, 
"It always seemed to me that the 
group I was with were pretty 
sharp." Like Benford and Brin, 
Vinge writes in the sub-genre 
known as "hard" science fiction. 

Vinge feels there is no problem 
with being a professor of math-
ematics and a science fiction 
writer. "The two are easily kept 
separate," he said. "Almost uni-
versally there is at least neutrality 
and often pleasure that this per-
son is a writer. " 

Elgin, who was on the faculty 
of S DS U's linguistics department 
for ten years, tells a different 
story. "When someone like my-
self goes for tenure and our vita 
have to be examined, our pub-
lications checked, there is almost 
always a ruling that our science 
fiction novels can not be con-
sidered because they're not 'real' 
novels," she said. However, ac-
cording to Thomas Donahue, 
the current chair ofthe linguistics 
department at SDSU, fiction is 
not an important part of the 
tenure review process, although 
fiction might be more important 
for earning tenure in the field of 
literature. 

A few of these Sci-Fi writers 
have mentioned UCSD in their 
work. Benford's Timescape is 
one such example. In Vernor 
Vinge's The Peace War a section 
of the "biotechnology under-
ground" is located where the 
Scripps Institute of Oceano-
graphy used to be. Kim Stanley 
Robinson's The Wild Shore 
includes a short tour of the 
rubble of a post-nuclear-war 
UCSD. In Feist's new horror 
novel, Faerie Tale, UCSD gets a 
mention and there's some dialog 
about the correct pronunciation 
of "La Jolla," although his book 
is primarily set in upstate New 
York .

Last November, the UCSD women's volleyball 
team made history by becoming the first NCAA 
Division III team to repeat as national champions. 

Next week, the Triton's women's tennis team 
will attempt to duplicate that feat as they travel to 
Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia to defend 
their 1987 title in the NCAA National Tourna-
ment Championships. 

Pitzer match Tuesday afternoon. Although 
Kenyon is ranked no. 3 in the tournament, 
Pomona-Pitzer could pull off an upset. When the 
Tritons defeated Pomona during the regular 
season, although the final score was 7-2, just 
about every malch went the full three sets. 

"I predict we'l be playing Pomona in the 
second round," laPlante said. 

"We had .a really close match during the regular 
season and I think they can beat Kenyon."

Continued from Pll' 12 
pitching performances by Sasaki 
and Hurtt on Sunday, the Tritons 
could only manage to split a 
doubleheader with UC Riverside. 

Sasaki benefitted from one big 
inning in which the Tritons strung 
together five hits in a row to 
produce all four of their runs. 
That would be all she needed . 

With the help of some out-
standing team defense, Sasaki 
limited UC Riverside to one run 
and won her second game of the 
weekend. 

Five Triton errors in the second 
game accounted for the UC 
Riverside runs and wasted an 
impressive outing by Hurtt as 
the Tritons fell 3-2 in the night-
cap.

Bassi said. 

Twenty teams will be going to 
the double-elimination Regional 
Playoffs and , of those, six will 
advance to the National Tourn-
ament in Elmhurst, Illinois. 

Bassi feels that the Tritons 
(31-8-1 overall, 29-2 vs Division 
III opponents) have a good shot 
to win their regional and advance 
to the Nationals. 

"We just need some great 
defense and out pitching has to 
be as strong as it's been of late. 
Sasaki and Hurtt can carry out 
team. If they do and we play the 
way we're capable of playing we 
can do it." 

But the National Tournament 
is another story. There things 
could get much tougher for the 
seventh ranked Tritons. 

"We have a very young team, 
without much experience in big 

"Redlands always always gives us good 
games and Riverside is a Division II univer-
sity. By playing well against two strong 
teams, we were able to gear up for the 
playoffs." 

Triton coach Lisa Bassi felt 
the games were a good lead in to 
the NCAA Western Regional 
Playoffs which will be played on 
May 13 and 14.

games and Riverside is a Division

a little more experience in tourn-
ament play before we can be 
considered a real factor for the

A healthy Christine Behrens 
will play in the no . I spot for the 
team. Last year, Behrens rallied 
from match point in her second 
set to defeat Kristen Carter of 
Occidental, 4-6. 7-5, 6-4 on shin

Julie Berman, Rhonda Meier 
and Janet Whalen are the other 
returning veterans of Nationals

Susie Mitchell, the Triton's

muscle pains in both legs this 
week and might only play her 
doubles match with Whalen a-
gainst Smith. She would resume 
her singles play should UCSD

we make it to the finals." 

As long as the Tritons stay 
healthy, UCSD could be looking 
forward to bringing home ano-
ther consecutive NCAA title for 
the '87-'88 year. 

Cycling hopes 
for top-3 finish 

The intercollegiate cycling 
season is coming to a close 
with UCSDtied for third place 
with Stanford with 570 cumu-
lative points over the cycling 
season. Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo and UC Santa Barbara 
lead the division with 600 
points. 

Last weekend, UCSD won 
both races held at the Uni-
versity of San Diego. Mark 
Wenman won the 0.6 mile 
criterium course on Saturday, 
April 30, and the team com-
bined to take the 0.5 mile 
steep hill climb trial on 
Sunday. 

This weekend, the team will 
participate in the Western Col-
legiate Cycling Champion-
ships. UC Irvine will play host 
the participating schools in 
two races. 

Saturday May 7, will feature 
a road race, varying in length 
from 40 to 67 miles depending 
on the rider's racing category. 
The race will be moderately 
difficult, taking riders over a 
series of rolling hills. 

Time trials (-races against 
the clock) and a 0.8 mile 
criterium will take place on 
Sunday. The criterium will be 
held on the Irvine campus and 
will be used to determine the 
winner of the 1988 Western 
Collegiate Cycling season. 
The UCSD team can remain 
in the top three places by 
beating both Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and UC Santa 
Barbara. 

Participating in this week-
end's events will be Weinman, 
Andy Nevitt (a United States 
Cycling Federation category 
2 racer), Mike Robertson and 
Larry Trevino in the A (expert) 
category, Pete Fish, John 
Lasky, Gordon Ong, Dave 
Warren and Scott Holtz in the 
B (experienced novice) cate-
gory, Eric Brounstein, Mike 
Chow, Carlos Santana, and 
Joe Lerner in the C (first-
year) category and Christi 
Wellington, Cindy Brown and 
Jennifer Poodry in the 
women's races.

IASKETIALL 

When you think of ba all what 
comes to mind is a dark, d~gy, sweaty 
gym. Gym rats hanging out 10 olay In the 
next game of this poorly ventilated old 
dirty hoop patace. Guys will spend all day, 
all week, wait ing to get In on the action. 
The game is rough. Driving through the 
paint is like taking your life in your hands. 
Unless y~u lose a hand or an arm you 
don't dare'call a foul· no autopsy, no foul 
This IS basketball. 

Our Inner cities are famous for their 
outdoor courts and the legendarty stars 
who spent hours getting therr basketball 
educations there. San Diego enjoys some 
of the best weather in the country, so It is 
natural that we feature an outdoor bas· 
ketball tournament here at UCSD. The 
acllOn in the Thrrd Annua l Sun God Out -
door Basketball Tournament will not look 
like an Inner city court, but remember we 
are in La Jolla. We have to make certain 
adjustments to get an authentiC outdoor 
atmosphere 

The tournament will take place Satur-
day May t 4, at the MUIr outdoor courts. 
The aCllon begms at , 0 : a.m. Refresh-
ments will be prOVided for all participants. 
Sign up your Five-person team at Canyon-

II was a scene you would only see in a 
Hollywood movie. A scene so unreal that 
iat had to be real. You couldn't duplicate it 
in one-hundred tries. Not even Steven 
Spielberg. 

I mean, here we are at Mariner's Point 
on beautiful Mission Bay for the 13th 
Annual Budweiser Collegiate Over-the-
Line tournament. It 's late, late Saturday 
afternoon . . the sun long since departed. 
Where once hundreds of players and 
spectators had roamed earlier in the day, 
there stood only a few , Two teams and a 
lone scorekeeper to be exact. And oh 
yeah, there was a fan or two. Closerto one 
though than two. 

The wind was howling in from the 
southwest. A pack of coyotes couldn't 
howl louder. And yes folks, they were still 
plaYing Over-the-Line .. . that grand old 
beach game Invented and perfected in 
San Diego some 35 years ago, 

With the sand whipping off the beach, 
like a huge sandstorm in the middle olthe 
Sahara , the team of Greg Kamansky-Thor 
Dekker-Carol Lipson (The Herd) were 
teeing it up one last time against another 
UCSD team of Scott Swegles-Scon Pickett-
Jennifer Cutler (Return of Derelicts on 
Wheels). Both teams were the final survi-
vors in the Coed DiVision of the Bud OTL. 

Survivors they were indeed. The fact 
that they were stili there was testimony to 
their courage, fortitude, and intelligence 
But when the tournament director says 
play on, you play on 

The Herd Jumped out to a 6-0 lead early 
and then made catch after catch to com· 
pletely halt the Derelict hIItlng machine 
The six runs held up and the Herd, a team 
so used to gagging the big one, finally 
came through with an 1M championship. 
Over the years, they had probably choked 
more 1M big games than any team in his-
tory, but on this day the only choking 
gOing on was being done by the few hardy 
fools st ili left on the beach. They will still 
be picking sand out of their ears when 
Reagan leaves the Presidency. 

But all In all, it was a wonderful day with 
more sun, OTL, and good times than one 
had a right to expect. The results in all 
divisions are listed below.

Editor's note: Jah·his , a local reggae band who 
opened for Burning Spear last Frida, night, will be 
appearing free tonight ar rhe pub and tomorrow at the 
Che Cafe with a $5 admission fee. 

UCSD student Sean Brandes, a memberofJah.his 
was intertllewed during a recent relletJrsal by writer 
Aut14mn Ehrmann. 

bv autumn ehnnann 
hiatuI: We'l start with the basics. Tell me, 
who is in your band? 
lean brandel: Well, there's me, I play bass, 
I Drum does percussion, Mark Zinke is on 
keyboards, I Chill plays guitar and lza Blue 
was our lead singer. 
h: Was? 
I.b.: He left just the other day to go live in 
Jamaica. 
h: Why? 
I_b.: Well, he likes it there and now he can go 
and sing in the hills and concentrate on his 
music, 
h: The band you're in, jah·lsis, is a reggae 
band. 
I.b_: Yeah, Roots reggae, 
h: As opposed to what? 
I.b.: Dance Hall reggae. Dance Hall is a cer· 
tain kind of reggae that's more dance music . 
h: Who plays Dance Hall reggae? 
I.b.: Yellowman. T"ose guys are Dance Hall. 
It's called slackness music. 
h: As in slacking off? 
I.b.: Yeah. Dance Hall music can get pretty 
meaningless. Roots music has to do with 
consciousness and culture, 
h: Do you try to have some sort of message 
in your music? 
I_b.: Yes, we have a Rasta message. 
h: What exactly is Rastafarianism? . 
I.b.: It's a way of life . It started with Ras 
Tafari, who was the Emperor of Ethiopia 
in 1930. His other name is Haile Selassie the 
First Rastafarians recognize him as the 
Second Coming of Christ, 
h: Are all Rastafarians Christians? 
I.b.: Some Rastafarians don't believe injesus 
Christ, but a lot do and they all should. 
h: Why the dredlocks? 
I_b.: Well, in the Bible in Numbers 6:6 there 
are rules that say to let your locks grow. It 
also says to not shave or drink alcohol. 
h: But I'm sure not all Rastafarians follow 
that last rule. 
I.b.: Right. There are a lot of Rastas who 
drink, and because they do, their hair doesn't 
matter. Their hair is worthless. Being Rasta 
isn't just letting your hair grow and listening 
to reggae. 
h: It sounds as if you take the Bible pretty 
literally. Does that mean that Rastafarians 
don't believe in premarital sex? 
I.b.: Some things are bullshit. We follow the 
Ten Commandments and we observe the 
Sabbath, 
h: Every Sunday? 
•• b.: No, the real Sabbath is from six at night 
on Friday until six at night on Saturday. It 
was the Europeans who made the Sabbath on 
Sunday, so they could party all weekend and 
recuperate Sunday before work. 
h: So you don't work on the Sabbath~ 

•• b.: No, I play, but the band really 'isn't 
work. It's playing music for Jah. 
h: What else do you do? . 
•• b.: We fast from midnight on Friday until 
Saturday at noon. 
h: So you basically just miss breakfast. 
I.b_: Yeah. basically. 
h: Is there a church that you go to? 
I. b.: The Rastafarian Church is called the 
Twelve Tribes of Israel, but I've never been 
to one. 
h: Where are these churches? 
•• b.: The ones that I know of are in Los 
Angeles, London and jam;.: -'. 
h: But you personally don't go to church? 
I.b.: I don't think church is necessary, In the 
Bible it says that when you pray, you should 
do it alone. 
h.: What's the connection between maril 
juana and Rastafarianism~ 
I.b.: Actually it doesn't have that much to do 
with herb. But a lot af Rastas smoke it to 
meditate or give thanks to God, or Jah. 
h: Unfortunately for Rastas everywhere, 
marijuana is illegal. 
I.b.: That's just a Babylon law. All over the 
Bible it says that God made herbs for people 
to use. 
h:What do you mean by a 'Babylon law'? 
•• b.: Western society is Babylon. Money, 
capitalism, materialism, policemen -they're 
all Babylon, Rastas chant down Babylon. It's 
just evil. 
h: Which came first for you, the reggae or 
the Rasta? 
I.b.: I first listened to reggae, then I got into 
the religion, then I started playing. I'm 
always learning new things, 
h: Do you have a Rastafarian equivalent for 
the Bible? 
s.b.: I have one I got in Jamaica from the 
Ethiopian Orthodox Church. 
h: What have you learned? 
•• b.: Well, basically, Rastafari deals with 
African consciousness. It's recognizing Africa 
as Zion, the holy place where life started. 
h: I've heard that a lot of Rastafarians are 
fairly chauvanistic, 
I.b.: There are a lot of chauvanist Rastas, but 
Jamaica itself is a chauvanistic society, like 
most third world countries, Most modern 
Rastas aren 't like that now thanks to the 
increased importance of women in their 
society. Makeda, for instance, she got us 
going. 
h: Do you ever run into resistance being an 
all-white reggae band? 
•• b.: People look at us and see white people 
from North County, but they don't really 
know. So many people have Rastafari stickers 
on their car, but they don't believe it, We 
believe it. 
h: Who would you say are your biggest musil 
cal influences? 
s.b.: Deep roots guys. Don Carlos, Hugh 
Mundell, U.Roy, Culture, old Black Uhuru, 
h: You played last Friday at the gym with 
Burning Spear. 
..b.: Yeah, and we're also playing this week 
at the Pub and at the Che.

Outspoken Oil 
by larry weintraub 

hiatus wrlt.er 

There was a time when 
Australia's Midnight Oil was 
considered a radical Dunk band 
who preached equality, nuclear 
disarmament and political 
morality. Nearly a decade after 
the Oils first jumped on stage 
at a local Australian pub, their 
message still remains the same, 
but the music has progressed 
into a refined blend of hard 
rock and stirring melodies. 

The preparation that 
went into the Oil's latest work 
is one which has seldom been 
reported in the music indus-
try. Having completed a world 
tour that included headlining 
slots at Melbourne'S gigantic 
Kooyong Stadium, the 
band traded in the lights and 
elaborate sound systems for 
the sand and the drought of 
Australia's desert. 

Spending a great deal of 
time interacting with the native 
Australian Aborigines, Mid-
night Oil acquired an appreci-
ation for the culture and his-
tory of the remaining members 
of their ancestry. Playing con-
certs in front of audiences 
who had never heard their 
music , the Oils turned down 
the volume and personalized 

their show to expand appeal 
to a new and diverse crowd. 

What resulted from this 
collection of remote dates 
known as the "Black Fellow 
- White Fellow" tour, was 
the hard-edged important 
songs that make up "Diesel 
and Dust." In a taped inter-
view provided by CBS 
Records, lead singer Peter 
Garrett explains, "This is a 
record that is about the expe-
riences that five people have 
had in their own country." 

The other four members 
that accompanied Garrett on 
this experience include: guita-
rist and keyboafdistJim Mog-
inie; guitarist Martin Rotsey; 
bassist Peter Gifford; and 
drummer Rob Hirst. 

Known as a band that is 
extremely outspoken when it 
comes to political and social 
topics, "Diesel and Dust" 
continues to pursue awareness. 
The album's topics range from 
the poor treatment of the 
Aborigines, to the call for 
nuclear arms deployment, and 
finally, to the acknowledgment 
of equality among people of 
all colors and religions. Drum-
mer Rob Hirst points out, 
"We're prepared to be put on 
pedestals and we are prepared 
to talk about the things that

music of the early 1960s. 
Written by Melinda Gilb. 
Steve Gunderson and Bryan 
Scott (Gilb and Gunderson 
are also two of the central 
characters), the emphasis of 
the play is the music of that 
time period. 

The story. set in a laun-
dromat, begins with a girl 
named Cindy, who is jilted by 
her pen-pal/boyfriend on her 
birthday. She quickly decides 
to end it all by wrapping some 
pedal-pushers around her neck 
and setting them to 'spin' in a 
washer. 

Enter her two guardian 
angels, who are extreme ver-
sions of "Laverne and Shir-
ley:" Marge, the skimpily-
dressed, boisterous redhead, 
is set at odds with Dee Dee, 
the sweet brunette who is all 
in pink. The two try to lift 
Cindy out of her low spirits. 

The storyline, however, is 
merely a vehicle for the songs 
- 42 in all - to be per-
formed. The songs include 
"Respect," "Be My Baby," 
"There's Always Something 

There to Remind Me," and 
other early '60s favorites . 

Christine Sevec, as Cindy, 
does a good job of upholding 
Cindy's peppy energy-level 
throughout the show. She also 
has a strong singing voice, 
which is important as she sings 
at least 30 of the songs. Susan 
Mosher (Dee Dee) and Gilb 
(Marge) also have good, pow-
erful voices. 

The only time that this is a 
problem is when the three 
women sing together . Al-
though their voices blend well, 
at points the volume is too 
loud for the song to be enter-
taining. However, this prob-
lem seemed to be due to the 
sound system and not to the 
women. 

Gunderson, who plays 
"everyone else," provides 
many comical moments in his 
roles (including a postman, 
and old woman, and a nerd 
date for Cindy). All in all, the 
cast was very good and worked 
well together . 

The only viewers who may 
not enjoy the play are people 
who do not know the music of 
the early '60s. The members 
of the audience, who were 
mostly older than 30, reacted 
excitedly when almost every 
song began. The players even 
received a standing ovation at

The really bad thing about 
writing movie reviews is that 1 
am obligated to sit through all 
the movies, good or bad. I sit 
there thinking how much 
more fun I could be having. 
There I am, stu~k in a dark, 
hot theater surrounded by fans 
of some lame San Diego radio 
station who happened to get 
the same free tickets that I 
came across. 

Sometimes, I wind up in a 
dark theater with maybe two 
or three other movie review-
ers. Last week, 1 had the mis-
fortune to wind up in the 
former case. I was blessed by 
what seemed to be millions of 
B-100 fans and the "special 
sneak preview" of the new 
movie "Sunset." 

Susan Mosher, Stew Gunderson, Melinda Gilb and Chri.!tine Sevec are 
featuTed in "Suds: The Rocking '60s Mwical Soap Opera." 

Some movies are saved from 
the doldrums of mediocrity 
by a strong star, a few funny 
jokes, or nice pictures of 
beautiful scenery. There are, 
however a few movies that 
unfortunately are not blessed 
with any of the above. "Sun-
set" has bland jokes, a stupid 
and predictable story, bad 
sound, and pictures of ugly 
scenery. See SUNSET, pale 4

on,.1 Guardian 
Tim Scotc played to an enthusiastic crowd at the Triton Pub on April 
29. His musi repertoire, which can be described as a cross between 
" Bob Dylan and Lynryd Skynyrd," was both danceable and 
crowd-rousing. UCSD students even joined Scott on stage for a song or 
two. 

Sunset 
Continued from page 3 

The only reason this film 
should not be banned on the 
grounds of good taste is some 
slightly above~average acting 
on the part of "The Rockford 
Files" star , James Garner . 
There is really no other reason 
to see this movie. 

Mix and Earp become fast 
friends, shaking up the cor~ 
rupt police department en 
route to solving a brutal 
murder. 

Along the way, Garner and 
Mariel Hemingway (in her 
standard role as a bimbo) get 
romantically involved. After a 
series of really predictable plot 
twists the guys get the girls, 
the killer gets killed, and you 
can guess what Mix and Earp 
ride off into.

bands are traditionally not 
supposed to do." 

The fact that "Diesel and 
Dust" entered the Australian 
charts at No.1 and the Ameri~ 
can Billboard charts at No. 40 
is due not only to the band's 
large following, but also to the 
significant radio response that 
the Oils have received in the 
United States. Instantly top~ 
ping the college radio charts, 
the album's first single, "Beds 
are Burning," has familiarized 
countless American listeners 
with the Oil's music. 

Based on first~hand obser~ 
vances of the poor treatment 
being received by the Abori~ ' 
gines, "Beds are Burning" calls 
for a recognition of this over~ 
looked community. Singer 
Garrett explained, "When you 
think that Australia is the only 
form of British colony which 
hasn't had a treaty with indi~ 
genous peoples that it con~ 
quered, then you know why 
beds are still burning!" Lyric~ 
ally this same idea is conveyed; 
The time has come/To say fair's 
fair / To pay the rent/To pay our 
share/ the time has come/ A fact's 
a fact / It belongs to them/Let's 
give it back. 

pons in other lands. The same 
anti-violent theme reappears 
in the slow and eerie "Arctic 
World," which Garrett de-
cribes as a song aimed at 

Ronald Reagan coming from a 
child's pont of view of the cold 
war. 

Other outstanding tracks 
include the catchy and power~ 
ful "Dream World," which 
mourns the loss of much of 
Australia'S once~respected 
architecture. 

One of the most powerful 
and moving songs is one which 
was commissioned to the Oils 
for a movie project dedicated 
to the plight of the Abori-
gines . The result was the 
thunderous song, "The Dead 
Heart." Describing his inten~ 
tions with this song, Garnett 

said, "I had this idea of the 
song being the sort of one that 
could actually go not for eight 
minutes, but for 80 hours or 
something ... If you're going 

cross~country to Perth, you 
could have a song like 'The 
Dead Heart ' just keeping on 
going and you'd tune your 
engine to the sound and the 
beat of the track and it would 
never stop and it would propel 
you right across the country. " 

With "Diesel and Dust," 
Midnight Oil has captured the 
true feeling of Australia's warm 
and rarely~seen desert com-
munity. Paying tribute to for~ 
gotten people and calling for 
the realization of society's 
imperfections, Midnight Oil 
has passionately achieved their 
goals in "Diesel and Dust." 

"Moonlighting" star Bruce 
Willis plays a character sim~ 
ilar to the one he plays on TV, 
but he is stretched beyond his 
talent. He belongs in the '80s, 
not the '20s. He plays Tom 
Mix, a famous silent~screen 
cowboy making his first talkie 
chronicling the life of rough-

and~tumble U.S. Marshal 
Wyatt Earp. Garner plays 
Earp, who is invited to Holly~ 
wood as a technical adviser. 

There is really no reason 
why anyone would really want 
to go and see this movie. It 
isn't funny (well, it isn't funny 
often enough), it isn't sus~ 
penseful, it doesn't make a 
profound comment on the 
state of today's society and 
worst of all, it isn't entertain~ 
ing. It is just out~and~out bad. 

The following song, "Put 
Down That Weapon," uses 
creeping guitars and steady 
drum beat to stress the need 
for nuclear disarmament and 
the removal of foreign wea-

The Oil combines strong melodies and lyrieJ relating W important human
