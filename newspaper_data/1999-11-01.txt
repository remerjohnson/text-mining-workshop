CHICAGO - A new study by 
doctors at the University of 
Chicago shows that sleep depri-
vation may be unhealthy. The 
study, which was pUblished in 
the larest issue of the British sci-

that a regular pattern of sleep 
deprivation may result in meta-
bolic and hormonal problems 
typically seen only in the elderly. 

The study examined the effects 
of sleep deprivation on a group of 
11 young men in their twenties. For 
one week, the participants were 
allowed only four hours of sleep a

Online Tickets Available· 
TECHNOLOGY: New program will enable people to print tickets from home 
By NADIA AZlZ 
Guardian Reporter 

Computer scientists at the 
Jacobs School of Engineering 
have developed a new technof-
ogy t,hat allows Internet users 
to purchase and print any type 
of admission tickets online. 
Scientists demonstrated the 
new technology last Saturday 
at the Birch Aquarium. 

The application, called 
Triton, was developed by 
Bennet Vee, assistant professor 
of computer science and engi-
neering, and Noriya Kobayashi, 
a visiting scholar working for 
NECJapan. 

Vee said that with the new 
technology, users would need a 
web browser, a computer and a 
laser or inkjet printer that is 
capable of printing at least 300 
dot5-per-inch in order to pur-
chase tickets online. 

"It could be used in an office 
or at home," Yee said. 
"Accessibility shouldn't be a 
problem." 

Vee and Kobiyashi are cur-
rently testing Triton out. As 
part of their tests, they offered a 
limited number of admission 
tickets to the Birch Aquarium 
online and then admitted 

. guests who had printed their 
own tickets from the web site. 

Yee added that although the 
technology has been devel-
oped, he and others are still 
working on developing Triton 
for commercial use. 

Denine Hagen, communica-
tions director for the Jacobs 
School of Engineering, said that 
the idea first came from the 
U.S. Postal Service. 

"This technology was first 
developed to buy stamps 
online," Hagen said. "So the 
U.S. postal service invited a 
bunch of vendors to develop it, 
and there are some companies 
where you can buy stamps

Expansion 
Measure 
Fails 
VOTE: Referendum 
received majority support 
but lacked voter turnout 
By JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Wfller 

Too few students voted in last 
week's specia l election. Though 
55 percent of voters approved of 
the proposed expansion of the 
Price and Student Cen ters, voter 
turnout was. not high enough to 
pass an increase to the student 
centers fee. 

In order for the measure to 
pass, at least 20 percent of the stu-
dent body had to vote. A simple 
majority of votes cast would then 
have been needed to approve the 
$25 per quarter mcrease to the 
student centers fee. Less than 13 
percent of students voted. 

Last spring quarter, the 
University Centers Advisory 
Board (UCAB) faced the same 
problem. Too few students voted 
to pass the referendum that 
would have added $12 million 
dollars of new structure to the 
existing student centers. 

So, they decided to put the 
idea to another vote. 

"We just want a definite 'yes' or 
'no' on this," said Student UCAB 
Chair Brian Cross before the vote. 

This quarter, UCAB employed 
an online vote, a device that has 
increased yoter tl'rnout at other 
schools by 40 to 50 percent, Cross 
said. 

At UCSD, using electronic vot-
ing through Student Link, voter 
turnout decreased by a few per-
centage points. 

Pearl Akamine, vice president 
of internal affairs for the 
Graduate Student Association, 
who participated in the final tally 
of votes on Thursday, said that it 
may have been too early in the 
year. Had she not followed the 
issue last year, she said she would

Pulitzer Prize Winner Addresses Globalization 
LECTURE: New York nmes columnist Thomas Friedman discussed the world's economic future 

Guardi., Reporter 

New York Times foreign affairs 
columnist and two-time Pulitzer 
prize winner Thomas Friedman 
discussed his new book The 
Laus lind the Olivt ~ at UCSD 
last Wednesday. In his lecture, 
Friedman spoke about the new 
international economic system of 
globalization and the expiration 
of the post-cold war world. 

He said that as a columnist in 
the late 19805, he described the 
world's economy as a "post-cold 
war economy~" Today, he said, 

the world is a "globalized" econ-
omy. 

Friedman said that the simul-
taneous democratizations of 
finance, technology and infor-
mation converged at the end of 
the 19805 and dismantled the old 
post-cold war system. 

He described the old system 
a& one divided by a great wall 
whose barriers eventually 
shrank and collapsed. 

Friedman said that with 
globalization came an increase in 
digitization and the convergence 
of products. He said the U.S. 
economy will change as global-

ization continues . 
"1 expect to see [the United 

States) being more of a service 
economy with a lot of high-end 
manufacturing," Friedman said. 
"Low-end manufacturing will 
move overseas." 

Friedman used computer 
technology to compare the post-
cold war system to globalization. 
He said that the new globalized 
economy is a system based on 
speed and connections, and he 
compared global economics to 
the Internet. 

"We're all connected but 
nobody's in charge," he said. 

Friedman said that unlike 
former economic srstems, the 
power structure 0 globaliza-
tion is run by super stock mar-
kets and super-empowered 
individuals whose power is 
direct and unmediated by the 
state. 

He said that people and coun-
tries with access to technology 
benefit economically, adding that 
economic success is dependent 
on the ability to "tap into the 
resources and energy of the elec-
tronic herd."

VOTE: 
New vote may not be 
held for two years 
ContInued from ..... 1 
not have felt infonned about the 
referendum. 

Cassandra Donovan, a Revelle 
senior who did not vote, said she 
felt that she did not know enough 
about the issue to make a quali-
fied choice. 

Nima Vahdat, student vice 
chair of UCAB, agreed that the 
vote may have been held too 
early in the year. Also, freshmen 
students, who the exp;1nsion 
would most affect, rna) not have 
been informed well enough, he 
said. 

The election was also held 
during midterm week for many 
students. 

Vahdat does not think the anti-
expansion campaign had any-
thing to do with the voter 
turnout. 

" I was never worried about 
the 'no' vote," he said. 

Vince Vasquez, the Revelle 
freshman senator who headed the 
anti -"big school feel" campaign, 
was out of town for the weekend 
tlnd could not be reached for 
comment. 

Fifty-five percent of the stu-
dents who voted Monday 
through Thursday approved of 
the increased fee and expansion. 
Last spring quarter when the ref-
erendum was put to a vote with-
out an anti-expansion campaign, 
the approval rate was the same: 
55 percent. 

In 1984, when students were 
asked to vote on a fee increase to 

fund the building. of the Price 
Center, 55 percent of students 
voted" es." "We~e consistent," said Jim 
Carruthers, director of the univer-
sity centers. "There are just not 
enough students voting." 

It may be more than two years 
before the student centers expan-
sion is put to another vote. 

This type of referendum can 
be put to a student vote only once 
per academic year. 

Vahdat said that UCAB is 
unlikely to put the referendum 
b, ck on the ballot at this time next 
year. 

"We don't know if we'd do it 
in the fall because of the problem 
of getting out the infonnation," 
he said. 

Winter quarter is a hectic time 
for UCAB, when they change offi-
cers. 

And other large referenda 
planned for next spring quarter 
may overshadow a third student 
centers vote. 

Students must fund this type 
of expansion project on their own. 
The UC Regents do not fund pro-
jects that do not contribute direct-
ly to education. 

The student population is 
expected to increase by 10,000 stu-
dents, to approximately 30,000, by 
2010. The existing student centers 
were designed for a total enroll-
ment of 15,000 students. 

Carruthers said that the 
expansion will occur eventually. 

" It's going to happen," he said. 
" It's I'ust going to cost more or 
you'l get Cess." 

Vahdat agreed that the expan-
sion is necessary. 

" I wish students would think 
ahead to the future," he said.

ABSENTLY 
VOTING 
Laziness and inconvenience should not stop 
students from voting their minds 
8y ARNB. GUIANG 
Staff Writer 

The recent failure of the referendum 
to expand the University Centers dis-
plays a lack of student participation on 
campus. 

The failure of the referendum is the 
result of extremely low student voter 
participation. A guorum of 3,910 votes, 
or 20 percent of the student population,

Abstaining from voting with good reasons is 
better than blindly voting all the time 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

Political activists and lobbyists are con-
stantly bemoaning the conspicuously low 
voter turnout in the United States. These 
critics compare the 50 percent or less of 
Americans that routinely vote to some 
European countries, ~here approXimately 
80 percent of the population turns out to 
vote, and rave that our country is politi-
cally braindead and disenfranchised. 

This supposes that the only form of 
political expression possible in an election

to reach quorum. I'm not saying that the 
poor turnout was due entirely to this sen-
timent - the vast majority of those who 
didn't vote certainly did so out of good 
old-fashioned apathy. But that's not to say 
that conscientious non-voters didn't have 
an impact on the referendum. 

The logic behind not voting is a little 
Tisky, to be sure. By removing themselves 
from the voting pool, people who opposed 
the passage of the expansion measure were 
giving a higher percentage of the vote to 
proponents of the measure, and banking on 
universally low turnout to do the job for 

them. However, given the 
results of the last time this people do not appreciate 

how the act of not voting 
can be a powerful politi-
cal message of itself.

the notorious apathy of 
UCSD students, it 
seemed a safe bet to try 
this course.

which this non-voting 
campaign affected the

example. The measure

was it a conscious political message? 

There is a faction of students on cam-

Environment Important to California Religion Is Not Culture 
Editor: 

I would like to address David 
Yen's article on Al Gore (AI Gore 
Lacks Presidential Potential, 
Oct. 21). It was strongly worded 
and well-written. In many ways, 
Gore is not an ideal candidate 
for presidency. He has made 
quite a few false promises and 
hypocritical • statements. 
However, he recently made a 
bold statement that renewed my 
faith in the platforms Ite has put 
forth. Last Thursday, the Los 
Angeles Times published an arti-
cle wherein Gore stated that if 
elected president, a top priority 
would be to ban off-shore oil 
drilling and even to cancel exist-
ing leases. Even if Gore's politics 
are not perfect, this platform is 
one that we should embrace. 

Current California off-shore 
oil production accounts for only 
11 percent of total U.S. crude oil 
production. All the oil reserves 
off the California coast amount 
to only 3.5 months of U.S. oil 
consumption. Increases in U.S. 
auto efficiency would save eight 
times as much energy over the 
next 20 years as the total estimat-
ed oil and gas reserves off the 
California coast. 

Keeping in mind these factors 
- here is what the oil industries 
have accomplished: There were 
over 1,000 beach closings in the . 
summer of 1997 alone. Nine of 
those beaches will never again 
accommodate anyone. Over 74 
percent of California'S rivers and 
streams are unsafe for fishing 
and swimming. Parts of the 
ocean are so contaminated that 
on some California beaches, dol-
phins have washed ashore so 
loaded with toxic chemicals that 
hazardous waste cleanup 
experts had to be called in. These

contain heavy metals such as 
lead, chromium and mercury, 
and potent carcinogens like

Within the next 30 years there is 
a 94 percent risk of a major oil 
spill off the Southern California 
coast. 

Ever since the California 
dream has existed, however, 
there has been a dark side. 
Greedy developers, careless oil 
companies and careless indus-
tries have done everything to 
contaminate it for profit. Too 
often in our state's history, those 
who would spoil a priceless trea-
sure to make a profit have gotten 
their way, by hook or by crook.

where the entire town has been

This letter is not to endorse 
Gore; it is to recognize an 
urgent and valuable issue he 
has taken up. We should insist 
that he take action now and use 
his power as Vice President to 
carry out his plan. Furthermore, 
Gore's leadership in the envi-

dates to endorse the campaign 
now that they realize it is an

I disagree with the article in 
last Thursday's paper concerning

of same-sex marriage "Sexual

Gay people neither need to 
nor should be allowed to marry

be gained through alternative 
methods. For example, inheri-

Granted, Christianity is more 
widespread in America than any 
other religion. This does not 
mean, however, that everyone 
who feels its influence has accu-
rate knowledge of the belief sys-
tem itself. Much of secular 
America's "knowledge" of 
Christianity is actually stereotype 
or generalization. Because of this, 
Christianity has just needs as 
much as other religions to make 
itself known on our campus. 
People need correct information 
to make judgments, positive or 

gin of religion itself. Most world 
religions are based on the sup-
posed knowledge of some great 
truth. This can include the exis-
tence of gods, afterlives and, in 
general, a higher purpose for our 
rives than our years on earth. 
Contrary to American thinking, 
the belief systems did not arise 
with the express purpose of mak-

low turnout was due to the 
weather and other problems. I 
believe these dramatically lower 
numbers indicate a concerted 
effort on the part of opponents of 
the measure not to vote. Some 
people may disagree with this 
analysis, but they cannot deny 
the fact that the opponents of 
expansion got what they wanted: 
The measure did not pass. 

The results of the referendum 
also send a message to the 
administration and the office of 
student affairs. UCSD students 
do not care about issues that will 
not affect them. Students who 
are leaving the university do not 
care about problems that may 
develop, they care about prob-
lems that affect them now. If the 
University Centers or any other 
branch of the university's 
administration had any hopes of 
passing a measure t/lat will 
affect students several years 
down the road by having lame-
duck students vote it in, this spe-
cial election has dispelled that 
illusion. UCSD students have 
proven that they will not burden 

MARRIAGE: 
Homosexuals force

CoIItIK ..... ,... ...... 
nies are extending domestic 
and/or same-sex couples the 
same benefits previously extend-
ed only to married couples. 

Same-sex marriage would be 
little more than a convenience 
and, therefore, is not needed. 

The real issue here is not equi-
table treatment of homosexuals 
but rather tolerance versus accep-
tance. Currently, homosexuality 
is tolerated; that is, a person can 
profess to be a homosexual with 
relatively little fear of becoming a 
subject of hate crimes. 

I agree that such tolerance is 
appropriate. However, this is not 
enough for many homosexuals; 
they believe that homosexuality 
should not only be tolerated but 
also approved of and that legisla-
tion should be passed to enforce 
their views: 

I choose to be gay; you must 
believe that my choice is a decent 
and moral one. I choose a 
"spouse" of the same sex; you 
must redefine marriage so that I 
can marry and enjoy its benefits. I 
choose to act in ways your reli-
gion says is wrong; your religion 
is intolerant and should be 
changed to accommodate me. 

This sort of forced social 
acceptance is the goal of same-sex 
marriage legislation, which 
would be prevented by the 
Knight Initiative. 

Marriage is as much a reli-
gious . institution as it is a 
regal / civil one for many people. 
One might try to argue that 
changing the legal aspects of mar-
riage in order to accommodate 
homosexuals will not affect the 
religious aspects, but this is sim-
ply not true. Such a change 
would have a very profound 
impact. Among other things, it 
would lead to multiple defini-
tions of marriage - leg .. I mar-
riagl', Christian marriage, etc. Do 
we really need to reduce the defi-
nition of marriage in order to sup-
port an ideology that many pe0-
ple find offensive? 

Not only will same-sex mar- _ 
riage give few new benefits to 
homosexuals, but it will cause 
serious damage to the institution 
of marriage as well. I urge read-
ers to support the Knight 
Initiative and prevent this disas-
ter from taking place.

the university wants to milk

deplorable state of student

there was a referendum on a 
proposal to start construction of

would be overwhelming.

Failing to vote on these unim-
portant matters demonstrates 
this sentiment, and mandates 
that the university focus on 
problems that need attention 
now, not problems that are pro-
jected to emerge in three or four 
years. 

Being entrusted with the 
right to vote means being 
responsible enough to know 
when to vote. If you don't know 
enough about an issue to render 
an informed opinion, you 
should be responsible enough to 
abstain from the election. 
Likewise, if you feel an issue 
does not belong on the political 
agenda, you should be able to 
reserve the option of refraining 
from participating. 

The expansion of the Price 
and Student Centers will proba-
tlly be an important issue in 
three or four years, unless of 
course the housing problem still 
hasn't been solved by then and 
the residence halls are crammed 
to '125 percent occupancy. For 
now the voters have spoken, 
even if by their silence: This 
does not worry us. Deal with 
the problems that do.

FAITH: 
Religion clashes 

. with trust in science 
eo.tIRH.d freIII ...,. • 
religions range from the existence 
of a single God, to the existence of 
multiple gods, to the existence of 
higher spiritual states before and 
after life on earth. Many of these 
beliefs stand in direct conflict with 
each other. This poses two prob-
lems. First, if one of these religions 
has actually found the indisputable 
truth, the others are necessarily 
wrong. Second, since what we label 
"religion" generally involves the 
metaphysical, no religion meshes 
perfectly with our culture's trust in 
naturalistic science. 

America has dealt with these 
conflicts not by chOOSing a side 
and remaining loyal to it, but 
rather by reducing religion from a 
search for truth to an extracurricu-
lar activity. With every religion

consequences. I know a Jewish 
family that does not believe in 
God, yet weekly attends the local 
temple to pray and read the holy 
word of this nonexistent deity. 
I've met more than one atheist 
who claims to "embrace all reli-
gion." Frankly, I don' t see the 
point in praying to gods that don ' t 
exist, or practicing religious ritu-
als apart from their original signif-
icance. If you don' t believe it, why 
practice it? It's a waste of time. 

While I applaud the dissemina-
tion of information about the 
beliefs of different religions, I often 
disagree with the motives behind 
such action. Information should be 
available so that people can make 
informed decisions to believe in 
one god, five gods, no gods, nir-
vana ... or, as agnostics, to decide 
that we'll never know. When our 
society treats religion as simply 
another aspect of world diversity, 
however, it serves only to deny the 
fact that people actually believe in 
gods, afterlives and the like. 

People base their lives around 
their religious beliefs; people lose 
their lives for their religious 
beliefs. My God is as real to me as 
the paper you' re reading. You can 
agree with me or not, but do not 
reduce my beliefs, or those of any 
other religion, to a cultural phe-
nomenon.

Iraqi Opposition Groups Meet in 
New York to Forge Agreement 

CRASH: 
Plane vanished from 
radar screens 

Federal officials said that 
radar sweeps at 12-second inter-
vals showed that the aircraft fell 
from 33,000 feet to 19,100 feet - a 
drop of 13,900 feet - in 36 sec-
onds, indicating that it was 
falling "like a rock," as one avia-
tion expert put it. 

NEW YORK - Even in 
ex ile, Iraq's fractious opposi-
tion groups have spent more 
time d ivided agains t one anoth-
er than uniting aga inst their 
common enem y, Saddam 
Hussei n. But with the United 
Sta tes ac ting as midwife, more 
than 300 of their· representa-
tives converged on New York 
City over the weekend to try to 
forge a credible alternative to 
the present dicta torship in 
Baghdad . 

"We know what they ' re 
against," a senior State 
Department official said. "The 
question is what a re they for? 
They have not been as d ear on 
this message as they need to 
be." 

The conference took place a t 
the Sheraton New York hotel 
under the umbrella of the Iraqi 
Na tional Congress, a coalition of 
political organiza tions opposed 
to Saddam. Some came from 
inside Iraq but many more from 
exile. The coalition is recovering 
from a setback inflicted by 
Saddam's Republican Guards 
who defeated its forces in north-
ern Jraq in 1996. 

The conference was financed 

This week, four Iraqi 
rebels, two of them 
Kurds, are attending a 
10-day course in military-

Maverick Candidate Says 
Goodbye to Independence 

WASHINGTON - Sen. 
Robert C. Smith, newly returned 
from the campaign trail, sa t in his 
spacious office the other day and 
renected on the importance of not 
being a thin-skinned grudge 
holder. 

He had just fo lded an indepen-
dent p resident ial campaign that 
prod uced hardly a ripple, and 
even a newspaper in his home 
state, ew Hampshire, had asked 
in an editorial, "Where did this 
down-home guy get this goofy 
idea?" 

The senator laughed. No, he 
said, he would not respond in 
kind . He remembered the advice 
an old poli tician gave him years 
ago: "There's no point getting 
in to an argument w ith someone 
who has an unlimited supply of 

. ink and paper." 
Tu rning serious, he said, "You 

can't succeed if you' re afraid to 
faiL" All right, he went on, he's 
not going to be preSident. But he 
got to talk about his deeply con-
serva tive principles, and he met a

are stepping up their criticisms. 

"We continue to be haunted 
by the agenda of the extremist 
wing of the Republican Party, 
stuck in the Gingrich past," 

Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., 
the House minority leader, sa id 
recently, trying to tie Republicans

reSigned after the last election. 

But step by step across the last 
few months, the Republica n . 
Con~ress has moved towa rd 
Cli nton. Republica n leaders 
qUickl y abandoned their drive 
for a $792 billion tax cut after the 
president vetoed the legislation. 
And over the summer, 
Republicans quietly gave up on 
thei r promise to adhere to the 

lot of wonderful people. . 
Nevertheless, Smith must be 

hoping, as he prepares for the 
.. ex t phase of his public life, that 
some other politicians don' t hold 
grudges either. 

When he announced in JuJy 
that he would run for president 
as an indepe!,dent, he excoriated 
the Republican Party in an hour-
long speech on the Senate floor, 
saying that it was too willing to 
compromise, that pollsters had 
become more important than 
principles, that the party was frit-
tering away the victory it won 
through the Reagan revolution. 
His denunciation infuriated party 
stalwarts, not least Jim Nicholson, 
the Republican National 
Committee chairman. 

Now his campaign is out of 
money, and the polls he so dis-
dains show him registering bare-

stringent limits on spending set 
in the bipartisan balanced budget 
agreement of 1997. 

The nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office found last week that 
the Republicans were spending 
nearly $31 billion more than the 
$580 billion target that had been 
set in July as necessary to stay 
within the limits. 

Perhaps there is no better exam-
ple of the sea change than in edu-
cation. This year, the Republican 
majority's spending bill covering 
an array of programs - set for 
Senate passage this week and then 
a certain veto by the president -
contains $300 million more for the 
Education Department than 
Clinton requested. 

Even after the Republicans' 
last-minute 1 percent across-the-
board cut to government agencies 
is factored in, the Republicans 
would be allotting $37.1 billion for 
education - the same level origi-
nally requested by Clinton.

An American presence was 
conspicuous at the conference, 
though the Iraqis conducted 
their animated debates in 
Arabic. 

On Saturday, Sayyid 
Qadhim al Battat, a guerrilla 
leader who slipped out of 
southern Iraq on Oct. 10 to 
attend the conference, urged his 
fellow Iraqis to put aside their 
differences. Resplendent in a 
brown robe and white Arab 
headdress, Battat said that his 
troops were fighting "continu-
ously" against Saddam and 
deserved to hear that the Iraqi 
opposition groups meeting in 
New York had solidified their

Microsoft BegIns Lobbying 
WASHINGTON - The first 

part of the verdict in the 
Microsoft trial is due out soon, 
perhaps as soon as Friday. But 
Microsoft Corp. is already look-
ing past the legal case and lob-
bying the government to pass 
laws that wouJd protect the com-
pany in areas where it is being 
challenged in court. 

When the company distrib-
uted its annuaJ report in 
Sept~mber, 2 million sharehold-
ers also got a letter from Robert 
Herbold, Microsoft's chief oper-
ating officer, urging them to join 
a lobbying effort to protect what 
the company calls its "freedom 
to innovate." 

Loosely translated, that catch 
phrase means freedom to design 
products however the company 
chooses - including the free-
dom to bundJe other products, 
like a web browser, with the 
Windows operating system. The 
decision to build a web browser 
into Windows is a central ele-
ment of the government's 
antitrust case against Microsoft. 

Herbold's letter directs share-

holders to the company's "free-
dom to innovate ' web site, 
where visitors are informed that 
the "freedom to innovate net-
work was formed as a response 

With the court's findings 
of facts imminent, both 
sides in the trial are 
scurrying to anticipate 
and manage the public 
relations fallout. But 
Microsoft sees its 
lobbying effort as a long-
term political strategy 
that will be followed 
whatever the outcome of 
the case. 

to the overwhelming amount of 
correspondence" the company 
had received "regarding the trial 
with the Justice Department and 
other public policy issues."

trial are scurrying to anticipate

fallout. But Microsoft sees its lob-
bying effort as a long-term politi-
cal strategy that wiU be fotrowed 
whatever the outcome of the case. 

A Microsoft spokesman said 
the site was set up earlier this 
year "as just a way to channel 
the thousands of people who 
wrote to us about the triaL" The 
spokesman added that 
Microsoft's leadership had 
decided to send the letter to 
shareholders after the trial was 
essentially over because the 
company now viewed "freedom 
to innovate" as a broader term 
covering other political issues of 
interest to the company, like 
government I'olicies dealing 
with encryption, software piracy 
and Internet taxation. 

Hundreds of thousands of 
people have visited the web page 
and more than 100,000 have used 
it to send messages to Congress or

Adviser Pushes Al Gore to be Leader 
of t)1e Pack in Presidential Race 

WASHINGTON Vice 
President AI Gore has been pay-
ing Naomi Wolf, the feminist 
author, thouSjlnds of dollars a 
month to help him figure out 
how to become the top dog -
literally. . 

Ms. Wolf has been telling 
Gore that he is a beta male, a 
subordinate figure, and must 
learn to become the alpha male, 
or leader of the pack, before the 
public can accept him as presi-
dent, according to a report in the 
new issue of Time magazine. 

"She's a valued adviser, and 
she' ll remain one," Gore said 
Sunday on the ABC program 
"This Week." He said Ms. Wolf 
was one of several campaign 
advisers and that she specializes 
in strategy and communications. 
He said she works with his 
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, a 
law student in New York, on try-

ing to attract women and young 
people to the campaign. 

The magazine said Ms. Wolf 
had been receiving $15,000 a 
month since January but that 
Donna Brazile, who took over as 
campaign manager last month, 
has cut her salary to $5,000 a 
month. 

Ms. Wolf, 37, is the author of 
Promiscuities, a 1997 best seller 
recounting her sexual coming of 
age, as well as The Beauty Myth 
and Fire With Fire. She is married 
to David K. Shipley, a former 
speech writer for President 
Clinton and now an editor at The 
New York Times Milgazi"e. 

Ms. Wolf was an adviser on 
the Clinton-Gore campaign in 
1996 and worked c1osel,)' with 
Dick Morris, Clinton stop 
adviser, a position that evolved 
into influence with the Gore 
campaign. 

In "Behind the Oval Office," 
his own account of that cam-
paign, Morris credited Ms. Wolf 
with ideas about how to reach 
women voters - school uni-
forms, tax breaks for adoption· 
and workplace flexibility - and 
for "remarkably prescient analy-
ses of the social-cultural trends 
in the country." 

This included her notion that 
the nation was searching for a 
"good-father role model," which 
Morris said helped lead to 
Clinton's emphasis on family 
issues. Part of cultivating the 
father image included cultivat-

.ing his image as a leader, a qual-
ity that voters tell pollsters Gore 
lacks and one he is apparently 
trying to develop with Ms. 
Wolf's help.

SLEEP: 
Deprivation may 
speed aging process 
CoIdIIIued .......... 1 
normal routine of their lives. 

Eve Van Cauter, one of the 
authors of the study and a pro-
fessor of medicine at the univer-
sity, said that after one week of 
four hours of sleep a night, the 
participants' metabolic levels 
and their ability to process car-
bohydrates were the same as 
those of a 65-year-old man. 

The changes in hormonal and 
metabolic levels found in the 
study suggest sleep deprivation 
can result in mental sluggish-
ness and a decreased ability to 
process insulin, resulting in a 
buildup of blood sugar. In seri-
ous cases, the blood sugar can 
rise to the same level that would 
be found in a person with a pre-
diabetic condition. 

For students, this means that 
the quality of work accomplished 
after a period of sleep depriva-
tion is likely to be far worse than 
normal, due to a relative lack of 
energy and mental sharpness. 

While the long-term effects of 
sleep deprivation remain 
unknown, the findings of the 
study suggest that prolonged 
periods of little or no sleep may 
result in a quickening of the 
aging process. 

Fortunately, the effects appear 
to be reversible. After a weeK of 
sleep deprivation, the partici-
pants were allowed 12 hours of 
sleep for several nights. At the 
end of the study, the participants 
showed no signs of permanent 
damage, and their metabolic lev-
els had returned to normal.

MIT Fnltemlty Kicked 
out of Hou .. After 
... llow .... Prank 

BOSTON - Following a 
Halloween prank last Tuesday 
that injured one Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology sopho-
more, his fraternity was tem-
porarily kicked out of its Beacon 
Street building last Wednesday. 

Boston's Inspectional Services 
Department ordered Phi Kappa 
Sigma members to vacate their 
house by 6 p.m. last Wednesday 
citing building code violations 
including illegal constructiOn. The 
fratemity members were building 
a maze in their basement for a 
party last Saturday night. 

Last Tuesday afternoon, MIT 
sophomore Robert Lee was sent 
to Massachusetts General 
Hospital after a lecture-hall 
prank, intended to promote the 
party, went awry. Lee entered 
the room dressed as the Grim 
Reaper when a theatrical device, 
meant to send out sparks and 
smoke, exploded in his hand. 

City inspectors said the 
party would be canceled unless 
the university assumed respon-
sibility for it in writing. MIT 
officials released a statement 
saying that the school support-
ed the party and would help the 
fraternity fix the building viola-
tions, but fraternity members 
canceled the party anyway. 

Members of a neighboring 
fraternity, MIT's Delta Upsilon, 
called the citations ridiculous, 
saying that MIT fraternity hous-
es have been more highly scruti-
nized than other schools' greek 
systems after several incidents 
in the past few years.

University of Minnesota 
Offers NIcotine Patch 
F .... to Student. 

MINNEAPOLlS- University 
of Minnesota's Boynton Health 
Service began distribut ing more 
than 12,000 free nicotine patches 
Wednesday to 292 of the universi-
ty's estimated 14,400 smokers. 
Anyone with a university ident i-
fication card can obtain a free six-
week su·pply of the patches from 
Boynton's pharmacy department 
until they run out. Each box nor-
mally costs about $150. 

McNeil Consumer Products, a 
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, 
donated the patches. This set of 
patches comprised the third ship-
ment donated in the past six 
months. The two other ship-
ments delivered this year each 
lasted less than a month. 

The nicotine patch, first intro-
duced in the 1980s, works by 
slowly releasing nicotine into 
the bloodstream through pores 
in the skin. The patch reduces 
withdrawal symptoms by sup-
plying the body with a steady 
source of nicotine, although it 
doesn' t deliver the same rush as 
the day's first cigarette. 

For people unable to quit 
smoking with the patch, the uni-
versity is working on other ways 
to help. Last week, univerSity 
researchers received a $9 million 
grant from the National Institutes 
of Health to study ways to reduce 
nicotine levels in smokers who 
have been resistant to coiwen-
tiona I methods of intervention.

Reading the Writing Major 
Department is home to future poets and publishers, journalists and professors 

ma or· 
--_ ... _-... Issues 

JENNY NICHOLSON 
Senior Staff Writer 

For all those people who 
think only an insane few become 
literature-writing majors, here's 
some information you might not 
know: Literature is the second-
largest department at UCSD in 
terms of budgeted, full-time fac-
ulty. And, the literature-writing 
major has the most students of 
all the sections in the depart-
ment. 

Surprised? Many people 
don't know much about the lit-
erature-writing major or the 
wide range of students. who 
declare it. 

The students who become lit-
erature-writing majors have 
diverse interests. They are aspir-
ing journalists, professors, poets, 
technical writers, public rela-
tions directors, novelists, pub-
lishers - a literature-writing 
major prepares students to move 
into a number of careers. 

Many students transfer to the 
major from more traditional sub-
jects: biology, computer science, 
pre-med, psychology and count-
less others. Several literature-
writing majors came to UCSD 
feeling pressured to follow 
mainstream career paths, but 
realized that they were denying 
their real interests and eventual-
ly switched. 

The literature-writing major 
at UCSD offers a number of 
courses that cover the entire 
spectrum of the craft. The 
department requires students to 
take three survey courses focus-
ing on fiction, poetry and non-
fiction before declaring litera-
ture-writing. These courses give 
students the opportunity to try 
their hands at writing, to discov-
er some of the prominent styles 
and authors and to become 
involved with professors and 
other students in the major. 

Once students complete the 
series and declare the literature-
writing major, they must take six 
writing workshops. Screenwrit-
ing, persuasion, personal narra-
tive, poetry, science writing, 
short fiction and reportage are 
only a selection of the wide 
range of workshops that stu-
dents can take, all of which usu-

ally have 20 students."I've got-
ten to try all sorts of writing gen-
res, and I've found that I can do 
and enjoy each style,"Literature-
writing major John Maynard 
said. 

There is one requirement that 
students considering a litera-
ture-writing major should be 
aware of: the .dreaded foreign 
language sequence. While most 
students in the major complain 
profusely about it, many come to 
appreciate the requirement by 
graduation. A number of litera-
ture-writing majors, after com-
pleting their foreign language 
sequence, decide to study 
abroad. For those who simply 
cannot bear the pain of leammg 
another language, there are a 
few sequences, like Greek and 
Latin, that have relatively light 
completion requirements. 

Several literature-writing 
majors came to UCSD 
feeling pressured to fol-
low mainstream career 
paths but realized that 
they were denying their 
real interests and even-
tually switched. 

Literature-writing classes are 
taught by a number of distin-
guished and talented faculty 
members. Faculty interests are 
as diverse as the classes they 
teach, so students can easily find 
a professor whose focus paral-
lels their own. "There is great 
potential for students to work 
closely with a professor who is 
also a Significant writer on his or 
her own work." said Professor 
Fanny Howe, head of literature-
writing. 

There are many other advan-
tages to declaring a literature-
writing major. The small size of 
almost every writing workshop 
may seem like an impossible 
dream to science majors. But, it 
is true - many workshops have 
fewer than 10 students, and it is 
the rare upper-division writing 
class that has more than 20. 

Such small classes means a 
high level of teacher-student 
interaction and personal atten-
tion. By the third week, profes-
sors usually know the name and 
writing ability of every student. 
At UCSD, where many classes 
have more than 200 students and 
most professors use numbers 
instead of names, this is one of 
the greatest attractions the litera-
ture-writing major boasts. 

According to Howe, howev-
er, 20 students per workshop is 

not as significant as it may 
sound. 

"Twenty students can actual-
ly be too large a group for a real-
ly intense workshop experi-
ence,"Howe said. "We are defi-
nitely working on this." 

Another advantage to the lit-
erature-writing major is the high 
level of interaction among stu-
dents in the workshops. Student 
relationships are cooperative, 
not competitive. Instead of fran-
tically studying to get on top of 
the curve, literature-writing 
majors work together, as classes 
often require peer critiquing and 
group exercises. 

One of the greatest advan-
tages of the literature-writing 
major, however, is that students 
learn to think critically and to 
actively and creatively solve 
problems, rather than earning 
grades through memorization 
and standardized tests. In writ-
ing workshops, there are no def-
inite answers and students are 
free to disagree with the profes-
sor and to express their po'lnts of 
view. 

"For people who don't like 
being told what to do and those 
interested in their own thought 
processes, it's a good major," 
said literature-writing major 
Ryan Granger. "People learn a 
lot about themselves, in addition 
to leaming a lot about the sub-
ject." 

There are, of course, a num-
ber of disadvantages to declar-
ing a literature-writing major. 
Unfortunately, many students 
do find that there is not a pletho-
ra of jobs involving pure writing. 
When literature-writing majors 
graduate, most do not have a 
problem finding employment, 
but few find themselves actually 
writing on a regular basis. 

The high interest in science 
and technology that character-
izes our society has resulted in a 
general devaluation of the 
humanities. Unfortunately, there 
will probably not be any $15 mil-
lion gifts coming to UCSD's lit-
erature department anytime 
soon. 

For many people, however, 
the humanities have a focus that 
is far more valuable than other 
fields. 

"It's nice that, in a time and 
place where it seems as if every-
one is looking for stability and 
money, there [are] so many pe0-
ple in the humanities who aren't 
so concerned with success, but 
with how they want to live their 
lives," Granger said. "While 
other majors are a means to an 
end, humanities majors are an

OBSERVATIONS 

BEN GLEIBERMAN 
Contributing Staff Writer 
You'll have to excuse me if 

you find this essay a bit less 
comedic and lighthearted than 
what my column is intended to 
be. I've had some confUSing 
things on my mind and have 
found it hard to concentrate on 
my usual concerns, like "Why is 
there never enough beer at par-
ties?" or "Why is it that pop 
music is emotionally bankrupt." 
For these 15 minutes, however, 
I've decided to work out one 
particular, you might say, life 
issue. 

"If you pay attention, you' ll 
notice there's an entire life behind 
things." This line is from the won-
derful film "American Beauty." 
Lately, I have been increasingly 
fascinated with this concept, espe-
cially since this notion has begun 
to directly affect my life. More 
often than not, when things don't 
directly affect my life, (Le. wars, 
famine, plague), I'm about as' 
interested in them as / am interest-
ed in hearing Joan Rivers' fashion 
critiques. (In case you're wonder-
ing, that was a joke. I'm very inter-
ested in her fashion critiques.) 

But, / digress. Somehow this 
always causes me to get off topiC. 
Sorry. 

Anyway, I believe that you 
control your own fate, create your 
own destiny. I've always believed 
in this. It is the core of what 
jnspires me to live, experience 
and enjoy every moment of life.

end in themselves." 

To whom does the early worm go? 
Believing that your fate has 

already been decided for you, in 
my humble, yet correct opinion, 
is a defeatist attitude. If you 
think that your life has already 
been mapped out for you, why 
take risks? Why get out of bed in 
the morning? Hell, I have a hard 
enough time getting myself out 
of bed when I don't believe that 
my destiny has already been 
mapped out. 

this is sad. Then again, this 
may have somthing to do with 
my sleeping habits. Here's 
a.nother thing that has been con-
fusing me lately. There are cer-
tain things that you can't control, 

girls. 
I met a great girl. Her name is 

Rebecca, actually, for those of you 
who read my last column. She is 
one of those intelligent, funny, 
confident girls we've all heard 
about in folklore. She existed, in 
flesh and blood! I took the initia-
tive to get to know her a little bit, 
even asked her out. This was after 
finding out she's dating someone 
though, so I don't know if that 
counts. 

We hung out one night, and I 
was thinking that this "just 
might be the world's perfect" 
girl. (Apologies to the banana 
people for using their slogan.) 

aren' t the easiest people to get in 
contact with. No cell phones. 

I argued and tried to find 
holes in her belief system, but I 
couldn't. See, all those things in 
my "Fun Stuff" category, she has 
in a file called "Bad Stuff." But if 
those things are "Bad Stuff," 
why not throw in things like ice 
cream and freedom, just to 
round out the category? This 
time my opinion wasn't neces-
sarily right. I talked to her for 
hours. And her opinions and 
beliefs made I'ust as much sense 
as mine. On y her beliefs will 
keep me from the chance to date 
this seemingly perfect woman. 

There is one fact that out-
weighs all of the above disadvan-
tages for many literature/ writing 
majors - most are in the major 
because they truly enjoy writing 
and find that they are not happy 
doing anything else. Most writing 
majors are able to easily ignore 
the myriad naysayers and skep-
tics because, for them, money or 
prestige are not as important as 
the opportunity to do what they 
love.

If you think that your life has already been mapped 
out for you, why take risks? 

The point is, I don't believe in 
fate ... but as fate would have it 
we can't be together. How does 
that quote from "American Beau-
ty" fit in? Well, I saw this girl, and 
I thought certain things about her. 
But she had an "entire life" 
behind her that I never expected. 
AliI had to do was "look closer." 
What I found was a beautiful 
woman with interestlng things to 
talk about and a vibrant personal-
ity. They exist, just look closer. I 
hope we become good friends. I 
think we will because we control 
our own fates. (Had to plug my 
philosophy one last ti'lle.)

that you can't make happen, no 
matter what initiative you take. 

For example, I don't think 
that I could ever win the gold 
medal for the one-mile distance 
run in Kenya. There are two rea-
sons for this. First, I was born 
and raised in America. Second, 
I'm not fast; I don't run fast that 
is. No matter how early I wake 
up in the moming, I am never 
going to make the team. 

What was that saying? "The 
early bird gets the worm." But, 
hey, it goes against that argu-
ment of pre-ordained destiny. 
This brings me back to my previ-
ous statement and not "The 
worm goes to whichever bird 
was predetennined to get it." 
Just reemphasizing my point. Of 
course I gave a joke example, but 
this is really, as usual, about 

So this is where all the babble 
ties together. / found out that she 
is Monnon. This fact stood in 
direct opposition to my desired 
end. Understand that I have 
nothing against Mormon people. 
Some of my .close friends are 
Mormon. Hell, even my parents 
are Mormon. (They're not. I just 
say that for dramatic effect.) 

She follows all of those rules 
that Mormons do. No drinking, 
smoking, cussing, pre-marital 
sex, etc. I like to lump these 
things into a category I call "Fun 
Stuff." Also, no serious relation-
ship with a non-Mormon, which 
makes sense, since finding a non-
Monnon who will be down to 
follow all those rules would be 
tough. I mean, you' re pretty 
much limited to Jerry Falwell or 
the Amish. And hey, the ~mish 

I'm a little less cor\fused now, 
but I'm very tired. I ha~e to get up 
early and write a funny, important 
article on "Why there's never 
enough beer at parties." But 
maybe I'll give up drinking. I'll 
have to if I'm serious about 
becoming a Monnon.

Triton Women Enter Playoffs with a Bang PARTY: Halloween makes 
for good times Dominance: UCSD finishes regular season with a 4-0 pounding of USIU 

By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSO women's soccer 
team finished up the regular 
season at home on Thursday in 
much the same fashion it 
played the entire season - as a 
dominating and unbeatable 
force. 

The Tritons finished their sea-
son by downing the U.S. 
International University (USIU) 
Globerunners, 4-0. This closes 
out the regular season and cre-
ates momentum for the second 
season - the playoffs. 

After witnessing the first half 
of play, it looked as though the 
game would be a complete joke, 
perhaps even ending with a dou-
ble-digit lead. 

Triton Erika Alfredson started 
off the festivities before anyone 
could get settled, just 45 seconds 
into the game. 

During a mix-up in the penal-
ty box, UCSD's Cindy Dostalek 
passed the ball to Alfredson who 
scored the shot to give her team 
a very early 1-{l lead. 

"We were fired up," said 
Alfredson, explaining her team'.; 

quick start and giving credit to 
her teammates. "I got a good 
pass from Julia [Cuderl on the 
kickoff." 

The Tritons' Laura Oooly was 
the star of the game like she has 
been for many a contest this sea-
son. 

Oooly accepted a cross pass 
from the right by teammate Kara 
Morris. She then booted the ball 
and just like that, the score was 
2-0. 

Though Oooly had the big 
game with two goals, the play of 
the evening came from another 
Triton 15:14 into the match. 

The play shaped up like this: 
The Globerunners' Tara Skalada 
was alone with the ball at mid-
field but only until Dostalek 
showed up at the scene. 

Dostalek, one-on-one with 
Skalada, greedily stole the ball 
and proceeded to push down the 
field with Skalada struggling to 
keep up. 

After leaving Skalada behind 
to choke on her dust, Dostalek 
had only USIU goalkeeper, Ann 
Jensen, to beat. 

Despite having a strong 
overall game, Jensen was no

match for the fleet-footed 
Dostalek, who finished her run 
with an exclamation point, scor-
ing the goal to give her team a 
mark of 3-0. 

At the 30:31 mark, it was 
Dooly's tum again. 

Dooly accepted another cross 
from the right, this time from 
teammate Melanie Gephart, and 
shot the ball into the goal to 
make the game 4-0, sending the 
Tritons into halI-time with noth-
ing to fear. 

The second half was a differ-
ent tale. Despite clearly showing 
who was the better team in the 
first half, the Tritons sputtered in 
the second half, unabfe to hit the 
net a single time. 

"The first half we played real-
ly well," Alfredson said. "In the 
second half we just held on." 

USIU's Jensen was a force, 
saving 13 shots on goal. The 
Tritons took a total of 25 shots, 
harassing the Globerunner 
defense. Emma Borst led the 
way with seven shots, followed 
by Dostalek who took five. 

USIU was anemic on offense, 
only taking three shots, none of 
them on goal, making for an easy 

w w w 

evening for Triton goalkeepers 
Jennifer Hetland and Laura 
Dolkas. Hetland and Dolkas split 
time patrolling the Tritons' net, 
playing the first and second 

halves,~vely. 
"They made it a little diffi-

cult," UCSO women's soccer 
Coach Brian McManus said of 
the Globerunners. "In the second 
half, the players' heads were in 
the future and the playoffs, but 
we kept our lead and didn't do 
anything silly." 

The Tritons, finishing with an 
impressive 15-1 record, now 
head for the playoffs. Because of 
their exemplerary record, the 
Tritons were awarded a bye in 
the first round of the tourna-
ment. 

First round games are being 
played on Wednesday, but the 
Tritons will be allowed to rest 
their legs and await the second 
round. 

The Triton's first game of the 
playoffs will be on Saturday 
and will be played at UCSD. 
More details will be given when 
they become available. Look for

drops the UCSD record to 11-4-2

The first half of the game 
was not all that bad, with USD

with two goals and Parker with 
one goal and two assists. 

USD took 18 shots, eight on

Tritons' nine attempts, only two

Matt Hall gave up two shots 
but didn't need to make a save 
and even had an assist. His 
Triton counterpart Curtolo had 
four saves to go with the eight 
goals he allowed. 

The loss hurts the Tritons' 
chances of being accepted to the

UCSD students always have 
the same dilemma on the week-
ends when we get to this time 
of the quarter. You can either do 
the responsible thing and study 
for upcoming midterms and do 
the problem sets that are due on 
Monday or Tuesday, or you can 
blow all that off until late 
Sunday night and instead go 
out and party. 

There are a few different 
types of people at this school. 
There are some that will study 
no matter what. For you guys, 
just stop reading this right 
now because when I begin to 
relay the fun I had th is week-
end It will ruin your outstand-
Ing work ethic. 

The econd kind of UCSD 
student is the one who goes 
out if there is something going 
on, and if there isn ' t, they 
make someth ing. You guys 
probably had a good time this 
weekend because you always 
find a way to enjoy your-
elves. 

The third kind of students 
here are the people who work 
sometimes and then go out 
when something big is going 
on. This is the group that makes 
big weekends at UCSD what 
they are because they increase 
the student population at par-
ties. To you guys I say bravo 
because this weekend ruled! 

Going into this weekend I 
was excited. Other than Sun 
God weekend, this is the 
weekend when UCSD looks 
most like the other colleges 
around the country. 

Friday night was great sim-
ply because there were some 
new faces at the party I went 
to. I am used to seeing the 
same old alcohol-driven 
obsessors (gotta love 'em) but 
this weekend was different. 
You guys were actually out in 
force and joined me in my 
intoxicated state. 

Saturday afternoon at the 
water polo game the crowd 
was tremendous. 
Unfortunately we didn't win 
the game, but the crowd had 
a lot of fun trying (the guy 
who dressed up like a cheer-
leader had me laughing all 
night). 

I figured the rest of Saturday 
would be tame because I had a 
wedding to attend. When I got 
home I went to bed, tired from 
the night before. 

Before long I heard noises 
coming from the family room 
of my apartment. I walked out 
to see that a party had begun 
in my own home. I know that 
most of you would probably 
be angered by this phenome-
non, but I thought it was 
absolutely great. Usually I 
have to work to get the word 
out about something happen-
ing at my place, but there it 
was, right in front of me, with 
no effort on my part at all. 

Needless to say I got up and 
joined the fun. After a few hours 
of rambling conversation and

Humbling: UCSD defeats Cal Lutheran, but fall to Cal Poly Pomona to end its win streak at 23 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

With the UCSD women's vol-
leyball team, all roads have led 
to victory no matter how you 
slice it. However, like any true 
pessimist will tell you, all goods 
things come to an end. Such was 
the case last week as the 
women's volleyball team 
snapped its 23-game win-
ning streak. 

With the 
exception of 
two games 
this season, 
the Tritons have always 
hit the showers as win-
ners. Suffice to say, that there 
haven' t been many surrrises for 
the women's volleybal team so 
far this yea r other than its stun-
ning 24-2 record . Even that isn't 
much of a shocker considering 
the Tritons have dominated their 
division and will join the ranks 
of Division II next yea r. 

But UCSD did manage to con-
fron t some speed bumps on their 
yellow-brick road to the playoffs 
at Cal Poly Pomona last 
Wednesday, Oct. 27. The Tritons 
were antici pating a relatively 
easy match with Cal Poly com-
pared to other "challenging" 
opponents such as Cal Lutheran. 
After a streak of 23 consecutive 
victories, it is possible that the 
team began to assume too much. 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland 
and his squad were thrown off 
balance in terms of the amount of 
difficulty they expected from 

their opponents last week. 
On Saturday, the Tritons 

started off on the court at 
RIMAC versus Cal Lutheran in 
familiar fashion with a 15-4 vic-
tory in game one. Careful not to 
become complacent after the 
first game, the Tritons kept the 
heat on their opponent with a 
15-7 win in the next game. 

"We put pressure on our-
selves to not let up after the 

first game even though 
we were beating 

the m , " 
McFarland 
said . 

Playing without some 
key players, Cal Lutheran 

wasn't able to bring its best 
stuff to RIMAC last Saturday 
night. Cal Lu was also coming 
into the match with a 10-0 record 
in its· conference. Furthermore, 
history would tell ·you that UCSD 
would have to scratch and claw 'if 
they were to win, for they had 
lost in the last three meetings at 
Ca l Lutheran's gym. Fortunately 
for the Tritons, the tiger had no 
teeth and UCSD plowed 15-4, 15-
7, 15-2. 

"Their team didn't playas 
s trong as we thought they 
wou ld and [we didn't get] as 
tough a game overall from Cal 
Lu as we expected," McFarland 
said. But the Tritons weren't 
about to afford the opposing 
team any opportunity of 
clemency in this match; they 
still played hard .

attempts while Kathleen Hentz

Men's Water Polo has Rough Weekend 
FrIgIi~ Tritons get beaten on Halloween by UCLA one day after losing to UC Santa Barbara 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor . 

Heading into this weekend, 
the Triton water polo team had a 
head of steam and a lot confi-
dence. After wins over UC Santa 
Barbara and Dc Irvine, and a 
near miss against Pepperdine 
University on the recent 
series of road games, the 
Tritons returned 
home on 
Saturday for a 
rematch 
against the 
Gauchos followed by a 
Sunday game against top-
ranked UCLA. 

Both games ended in disap-
pointment as the Tritons fell 10-9 
to UC Santa Barbara and 12-4 to 
the Bruins. 

Saturday's crowd was a spirit-
ed one of s50 fans, many of whom 
were dressed up to celebrate the 
upcoming Halloween holiday. 

The exuberance surprised the 
Triton players and may have dis-
tracted them early in the game. 

"During the first three quar-
ters we almost seemed in awe of 
our own crowd," Head Coach 
Denny Harper said. "We normal-
ly embrace enthusiasm, but we 
seemed a little bit nervous." 

The Tritons got down early, as 
they surrendered three first-peri-
od goals and scored non them-
selves. This deficit was neither 
lengthened nor shortened during 
the second period as each team 
scored two goals. 

The third period was another 
ugly one for the Tritons as they 
were outscored 5-2 and found 
themselves down 10-4 after three 
periods. 

The Tritons finally turned the 
game around in the fourth, mount-
ing a fierce comeback. Ross 
Mecham scored 2 goals in the 

fourth period, including 1 two-
pointer. Vladimir Djapic 

scored with 1:25 remain-
ing to pull the 
Tritons within 
one . 
Unfortunately 

that was as close as 
the team came to victory, as 

UCSD feU 10-9. 
"We played with a sense of 

urgency in the fourth," Harper 
said. "If we would have made 
just a few six-on-fives we would 
have won the game." 

Indeed the 6-5 situation killed 
the Tritons, as they converted 
only three of 13 opportunities. 

For the Tritons, Mecham had 
two goals and three points, and 
Jonathan Samuels also shot three
