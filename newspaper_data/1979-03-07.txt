Public Favors Draft 
By Narrow Margin 

By Evans Wilt 
Assocla&ed Press Wrl&er 

NEW YORK - Concerned 
about how well the volunteer 
army is working, Americans 
narrowly favor bringing back 
the draft for the armed forces, 
a n Associated Press-NBC poll 
shows. . 

By a somewhat larger 
margin, the public backs the 
idea of universal public service 
for all young Americans. 

Those Americans most 
vulnerable to a draft - those 
aged 18 to 24 - overwhelmingly 
oppo e the idea of mandatory 
ervice in th armed force . 
The poll , taken F b. 5-6, 

found 49 p rcent of the public 
upported r instatement of the 

,draft. Forty-three percent 
oppose uch a move. Eight 
perc nt of the 1,600 adults 
interviewed nationwide by 
telephone were not sure. 

No Americans have been 
drafted since Dec. 31, 1972. 
Then-Pre ident Gerald R. Ford 
mothballed the Selective 

ervice system on Jan. 27,1976, 
and halted the requirement 
that all 18-year-old regi ter for 
a future draft. 

Support for a new Sel tiv 
ervlce system arise from a 

perception that relying on 
volunteer for the Army, Navy 
and Air Foree i not working. 

Critic 8y th volunt r 

system is unable to provide 
enough recruits for the armed 
forces and that the quality of 
recruits who do sign up is low. 
Others have said that 
minorities make up too large a 
proportion of the recruits. 

And some contend that a 
volunteer system is too 
expensive. 

Only 8 percent of those 
questioned said the volunteer 
recruitment ystem i working 
"very well. " Thirty-six percent 
aid it is working " pretty well" 

and 44 percent aid it is " not 
working well at all." Twelve 
percent were not ur . 

Fifty-nine percent of tho e 
who oppo e a n w draft think 
the volunt er sy tern is doing at 
lea t pr~tty well. But only 32 
percent of tho 'c who favor the 
draft rate th volunteer y t m 
that highly. 

Not unexpectedly , meri -
can aged 18 to 24 oppo ed the 
draft in the survey b a 62-33 
margin, whil tho e 25 to 34 
years old split 49-46 again t a 
new system. ' 

Member of the pubJi 65 and 
older favor rein Ututing th

Denyes called -the campaign 
"one of the worst experiences 
ot my Wfe" when reached last 
night after the results had been 
finalized, and attributed his 
victory to the "positive" nature 
of his campaign. 

"People just didn't buy some 
of the claims JaCoby made 
against me," Denyes said. 

JaCoby had charged Denyes 
with being beholden to special 
Del Mar development inter-
e ts, and charged him with a 
potential conflict of interest in 
his ownership of hou ing units 
involved in questions before the 
City Council. ' 

Denyes says he wm occupy 
himself with housing· and 
budget issues on the Council, 
the areas in which he feels he 
has some expertise. 

JaCoby could not be reached 
for comment last night.

Student Housing 
SUI Killed Again 
'Students Need Not Apply' Policy 
Still Allow~d; Another Vote Due 

B Jeff B r ford-Howe 
A ociate Managing Editor 

A propo al to outlaw housing 
discrimination against stu-
dents was defeated in the 
California A mbly Monday 
for the fourth tim in a many 
year. 

The bill , AB 224, ponsored by 
Howard Berman (D-Los 
Angele ) , will be reconsidered 
tomorrow. and is given orne 
chance of passing. It fell four 
votes hort of the nece ary 41 
Monday, 10 ing 37-38. 

Republican Bob Frazee , 
representative for Del Mar, La 
Jolla and CSD, voted against 
the meal\ure. 

Berman's legislation would 
prohibit landlords from using a 
" no stud nt .. policy in 
deciding who could rent in their 
complexe or dwellings. 

It would till allow credit 
checks, 12 month lea es, and 
other traditional banes of 
student renter . 

Debate on the floor of the 
Assembly centered on two 
' ssu. - whether or not 
students as a cia s deserve 
protection under anti-
discrimination law , and 
whether. 'students are" good" 
tenants. 

Berman told the Assembly, 
" It is well demonstrated that 
numerou apartment owner 
have 'students need not a pply ' 
policies simply because the 
prospective renter ha student 
status .. . in a tight housing 
market you can imagine the 
problems that causes. " 

The bill will also, he said 
"extend the protection against 
di crimination already in tate 
law to student ." 

Republican Assembly leader 
Paul Priolo of Malibu , though, 

aid th a t tud ent hav a 
reputation, wheth r de erved 
or not. a bad tenant , a nd 
compa red di crimin a t IO n

his bu in in Lo Angele . 

"I found that when I sold la p 
record r to people from a 
certain area, four out of fi e 
lime , they kipped payment, 
so I stopped elling recorder to 
those people . That would 
probably be illegal now, and 
that's too bad. Landlords have 
to protect their income," Priolo 
said. 

Leroy Green (D-Sa a -
mento) agreed with Priolo. The 
landlord, he says " has the right 
to be wrong . .. the right to 
discriminate" if he or she 0 
choo es. 

The bill wa the product of 
extensi lobb ing on th part 
of the UC Student Lobby and the 
Apartm nt Own r ' As ocia-
tion. 

Bret Hewitt, tudent lobby 
director, aid hi lobby will be 
trying to apply pres ure to ' 
seven a semblymen who voted 
again t the bill before 
tomorrow 's vote. 

Included on the lobby 's list 
are Wadie Deddah (D-Chula 
Vi tal and Frazee.

to apply some pre ur to 
Frazee "to I t him know he ha

In previou year , the bill ha 

been approved in the A m-
bly, only to die in the Senate 
Finance Committee. Thi ear, 
the bill had been a igned to the 
Senate Local Governments 
Committee, making upporters 
of the 'bill hopeful that the bill 
'would pa s thi year.

editorial 

Housing Plague 
The Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Act make it illegal in 

California to discriminate on the basis of age, race and sex. 
One other kind of discrimination, though, is not only legal, 

but flourishing across the state. Denial of housing to 
students because they are students plagues young 
prospective tenants attending private, state and UC 
colleges. 

Nothing exists in local, state or federal statutes that 
prohibits arbitrary discrimination against students -
discrimination that cuts against the grain of equality under 
the law that theoretically provides the foundation for 
legislation in this country. 

In the past few years, the UC Student Lobby has been 
fighting to get a statute through the state legislature 
eliminating housing discrimination against students. Yet, 
the lobby has failed each time, most recently this past 
Monday when a bill by Howard Berman (AB 224) was 
defeated 37-38 in the state assembly. 

The Bennan Bill is designed to subvert housing 
discrimination. It would not eliminate the tricks landlords 
use to take advantage of or discriminate against students, 
such as 12 month leases, but it would prevent them from 
denying accommodations to students simply because they 
are studenJ-s. 

His seemingly simple notion has run into problems in the 
legislature. The California Real Estate Lobby, led by Doug 
Gilles (rated the most effective lobbyist in the state by the 
California Journal) , has been working hard to defeat AB 224 
because they think students are bad tenants. 

There is no research or objective evidence indicating that 
students are less careful of property than the general 
population; there is evidence, though, that severe housing 
shortages exist in most college areas. With no economic 
pressure to change their minds, landlords can continue to 
discriminate. When a student destroys property now, the 
landlord is free to allow that "confinnation" of student 
irresponsibility to decide his or her leasing policy. 

••• 
Bob Frazee, who represents UCSD in the Assembly, voted 

against AB 224. 
Tomorrow though, the bill is being reconsidered, and he 

has another chance. We urge Frazee to take advantage of 
that second chance and vote in favor of the bill . 

Neglecting the large university community in this district 
will be remembered again next year, when the election 
cycle resumes and Frazee tries to establish himself in the 
district. 

Unacceptable 

Vending Fund Cut Would 
Give Gov't to Reg Fees 

Editor: , 
I would like to urge all 

students to participate in 
Vending Machine Awareness 
Week and take advantage oCthe 
opportunity to become 
informed about this important 
issue. 

All of us will be affected if the 
administration's decision to 
transfer vending machine 
monies to Housing and Food 
Services to alleviate snack bar 
deficits goes into effect. For the 
past thirteen years, vending 
machine profits have gone to 
student government, pro-
gramming, and related areas 
at each of the four colleges. The 
loss of these funds will force the 
colleges ' governments to turn 
to the Reg Fee Committee for 
allocations. Unfortunately, 
Reg Fee a lready has more 
budget requests than it can 
fund , especially in the 
aftermath of Propo ition 13. 
Campus-wide services such as 
Career Planning and Place-

ment and Health Services will scarcity of funds available.

Committee is unacceptable as as ideas or requests arose

A further result of a reliance 
on Reg Fee for funding would 
be the creation of an additional 
sense of competition between 
the colleges . What we need i's 
more unity, not less! Perhaps 
more importantly , Reg Fee 
members would be faced with 
the task of prioritizing the 
colleges and their respective 
programs - deciding which 
college should get the funds 
needed to carry out a particular 
program. Such a situation 
would be intolera ble for all 
concerned. Yet it would also be 
unavoidable because of the

The Warren College Cabinet 
is working along with the other 
colleges to help make Vending 
Machine Awareness Week a 
successful project. But the 
success of Awareness Week 
actually rests with the student 
body. We hope all students will 
utilize this week to realize the 
implications of the vending 
machine question.

Who Needs Steel? Export Education

of enrollments that could 
transform the American 
economy into a vast network of 
public and private educational 
factories by the year 2000. By 
the year 2050. more than half of 
all Americans could be 
employed in this complex. 

A (uturologists ' fantasy ? 
Hardly. The social foundations 
have been laid already, and the 
blueprints exist in the economic 

theori~s o( specialization, the 
divi sio n of labor , and 
comparative advantage. 

Just as the American 
economy earlier shifted from 
an agricultural to an industrial 
base, th e "educationalization" 
of the economy can be viewed 
as the logical next step in our 
country's historical readjust-
ment to major changes in 
market forces and technology. 
Based on our past record of 
social adjustments, massive 
structural changes are not the 
least unusual for the American 
economy. In fact , we constantly 
have d monstrdted a kind of 
genius for them. 

.Few people, for example. in 
1810 would have predicted that 
the agricultural work force, 
then 84 percent of the total work 
force, woul~ fall below 50 
percent in the 1880s, and below 
25 percent in the 192Os. Today 
agricultural jobs are still 
disappearing. They threaten to 
fall below 3 percent despite 
massive government subsidies 
designed to prolong the 
existence of the (amily farm. 

But while agricultural 
employment was declining, 
employment in other sectors of 
the ecomony was booming 
beyond belief. By 1900, the 
industrial activities of 
manufacturing, mining, and 
construction accounted for 27 
percent .of the work force, and 
services such as transpor-
tation , utilities, trade, finance, 
education and government 
accounted for 30 percent of all 
America' jobs.

Nuc Moratorium Overturned 
San Diego Judge Rules Federal Government Has Control 
Over Development; Atomic Energy Act Has Jurisdiction 

SAN DIEGO (AP) - A key California 
statute that effectively imposed a 
moratorium on development of nuclear 
power plants in the state was struck down 
as unconstitutional by a U.S. district court 
judge in San Diego yesterday. 

Judge William B. Enright issued the 22-
page decision on a lawsuit filed against the 
state Energy Resources and Development 
Commission and its officers. 

Plaintiffs included the Pacific Legal 
Foundation, the San Diego Coalition, the

conce rned with nuc lea r power and

The decision effectively means that the

1959 grants the federal government the 
final say over states in regulating nuclear

Lou Mullen. looking into the 
possibilities of a '. pro career . 
" He aid some scout were

Brockett said, And th at was 
before this season begun. 

Curious, si nce when Cun-
ningham first watc hed him and 
thought the tall freshman had 

. good " basketball in ·tincts." 
Brockett was not planning on 
pu rsuing any kind of goals in 
bas ketbal l. 

Coming from hig!: school 
ba ketba ll powerhou eVer-
bum Dei , where he only made 
JV, Brockett came to UCS D for 
its academics . Back then his 
idol was Fly Williams, a high-
scoring guard from Brockett's 
neighborhood in New York , and 
" the kind of guy who would buy 
100 tickets to a basketball game 
and pass them out to Ih e kids. 

Williams ha d problems in the 
old ABA (because his defense 
was. wea k) . Brockett s tiJI 
a dmires him , but perha ps It s 
not surprisi ng that a new hero, 
NBA scoring leader George 
Gervin of th e San Antonio 
Spurs, takes the first spot for 
the ambitious Brockett. 

His teammates call Brockett 
by the same nickname Gervin 
wears: " The Iceman." It ·s only 
partly because he goes to watch 
Gervin every time the Spurs 
come to San Di ego, They a lso 
recognize thut his style of play 
has at times been impressive. 

On defense , his top per-

Tritons Fly to Alabama to Try for NAIA's Top 5; 
Bennett Slashes Time in Time to Join 8 Others 

By Jon Goetz 
Senior Slaff Writer 

Seven UCSO swimmers and a 
diver jetted oCf to Huntsville, 
Alabama this morning in 
search of national recognition. 

In the next three days, the 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics will 
select its .new American 
swimming and diving cham-
pion . Though realistically 
UCSD won't be that school, the 
Tritons will be fighting to place 
in the top five , and will 
certainly figure heavily in the 
top ten . 

The group of athletes 
competing, Joe Hernandez , 
Lance Halsted, Mark Allen, 
Jim Agronick, Nelson Howard, 
Greg McGary, Jere Bennett, 
and diver Brad Olwin, all have 
a shot at scoring one of the six 
best times in their races, 
according to coach Bill 
Morgan. . 

And one o[ them would still be 
attending classes today if it 
weren't for his surprising 
performance Friday against 
Loyola, at the last meet to 
qualiry for nationals. Jere 
Bennett turned In a ~: 22 200 
breaststroke time,. making the 
Ali-American standards, and 
cutting almost ten seconds off 
his previous best of 2: 31.9. 

"He was physically pre-
pared, and he had a real 
positive attitude going Into the 
race, " said his surprised coach. 
" But he exceeded what I 
thought his potential was." 

" Bennett thought all year 
that he would go to the 
nationals. and now he ha. a 
chance of making the top 
twelve in the race." laid 
MOl'lan. 

The best hope (or an 
individual champlonahip, 
however. lies in the lreeatyU", 
o( Hernandea. He hal the best 

shot at breaking the national 
200 free record and wi nning the 
event, says Morgan . Hernan-
dez swam a school record 1: 44.5 
last week , and with an 
equivalent drop in times to last 
year 's National swim, he 
should break the record o( 
1: 42.5 easily, with a second or 
two to spare. 

He also has a shot at the ]00 
free crown, since only one 
swimmer who beat him last 
year will be .returning to the 
meet. Hernandez wi II also be 
swimming either the 50 or 500, 
and the 400 and 800 free relays 
and the 4()0 medley relay. 

As veterans of last yea r 's 
Portland Nationals, Hernandez 
and his teammates Halsted, 
Allen. and Agronick helped 
motivate the team during tiring 
workouts this year, constantly 
reminding them that a trip to 
Alab!lma would be worth the 
pain. Now they all return to 
their second national meet, 
with added poise and ex-
perience. 

Halsted will be swimming the 

200,500, 1650, the 800 free relay. 
400 medley relay, a nd perhaps 
the 400 Cree relay . Allen 
qualified in the 200 1M, 100 and 
200 back, the medley relay , and 
may swim the free relays . 
Agronick will compete in the 50, 
100, 200, 400 Cree relay, and 
possibly the BOO Cree relay. 

The newcomers to the 
nationals , Howard. McGary, 
Bennett. and Olwin also hope to 
contribute some points to the 
UCSD team total. Howard 
qualified in the 50: 100, and 200 
free, and has a shot at the free 
relay teams. McGary wlll swim 
the 200 1M, 100 breast, 200 
breast , and the breaststroke leg 
of the medley relay. Olwin will 
dive in the one and three meter 
springboard contests. 

With twice as many people 
qualified [or the meet than last 
year , the 1979 Tritons will 
easily beat their 1978 14th ~lace 
finish. " Now the guys want to 
prove to the school and to the 
athletic department thal 
they're not a bad investment," 
said Morgan . 

Star Needs Votes 
(Coa&.lnued from pale 4) 
oC cOurse, 

"They also consider other 
factors. such as defense, 
leadership, and attitude. The 
coaches I called all said they 
voted Cor him," Cunnlnghum 
said. 

He is confident Brockett will 
make the We.tern Re,ion 
team, and declined to speculate 
about the national level. 

If Brockett mlikea it, he will 
be only the second UCSD 
basketball player to do 10, 
tollowln. 8·7 center Paul 
Tralner's 1m achievement. 

Meanwhile, Hrockett's 
chances as a pro are not 
entirely riding on the NCAA 
coaches' votilll. He will play In 
loday's North·South ,ame of 
the District NAIA all-stars. 

And i( his basketball career is 
over? He can always rail back 
on what he originally came Cor: 
h I degree. Brockett ' s 
communications major has 
taken him to the control room of 
a network production oC 
Monday Nilht Ba eball, and he 
admits that the media side o( 
sport doesn' t eound too bad as 
II career.

squad had four men with 3-1 
records in singles play: John 
Rosenberg, Alex Rosenthal. 
Ron Phillips, and Alan Alpar. 
Hein went 4-0 for the two-day 
event, winning all his sin,gles 
matches in the number two slot. 

Paul Metsch , the team 's 
number-one player, had an orr

The best win for the Tritons 
came against UCD . Five 

Sparkling in the singles were 
Billy Hein, and Ron Phillips. 
Both dropped their opening 
sets, gained more control 
during the second set, then 
maintained that momentum en 
route to three set victories.

opposition , the win over ·

Coach Philosophizes 

Cunningham Feels Academics Outshine Athletics, 
Plans to Compare UC~D with "Balanced' Davis 

By Karen Hunler 
Sporls Edllor 

As the men's \'a rsity 
basketball team ended their 
1979 season with a 2-8 league 
showing. Coach Barry Cun-
ningham took a few moments 
out of his schedule to reflect 
on tl)e UCSD basketb'all 
program and about athletics 
at UCSD in general. 

" We need a commitment to 
both excellence and equality at 
UCSD. As far as I'm concerned 
we have only made a 
commitment to equality," 
Cunningham feels that there is 
a dilemma existing between 
athletics and academics. 

" I have no visions of a UCLA 
or an Ohio State," he stressed. 
"I just want a quality progra m 
like that of Stanford, UC Davis ' 
or Dartmouth. All threeolthese 
schools successfully mix 
academics and athletics." 

Cunningham has resigned 
from his coaching respon-
sibilities, effective at the end of 
the '78-79 season, but will 
remain at UCSD in a teaching 
capacity. He intends to spend 
more time on scholarly 
pursuits. 

Presently the physical 
education instructor is working 
on his doctoral dissertation, a 
study of Intercollegiate 
Athletics of the schools in the 

Far Western Athletic Con- just not geographIcally 
ference, with a special feasible." 
emphasis on the comparison of . By getting into Division II the 
UC Davis and UCSD. team and UCSD fans would 

Cunningham would like to see benefit, Cunningham believes. 
UCSD become a member oUhis " In a sophisticated community 
Far Western Conference. like La Jolla students are not Ir---------------------------I now we're in Division going to get excited about I - I 

Barry Cunnmlgn,am 
III which is mainly Cor small, 
liberal arts colleges." If UCSD 
went Division II they would 
play against CSU Northridge, 
CSU Dominguez Hills , UC 
Riverside, San Luis Obispo in 
basketball. 

"I'd like to be in a league 
where everyone does the same 
things in regards to academics 
and scholarships. The schools 
we compete with academically 
we should be able to .compete 
with athletically. Right now it is 

coming to watch a nonscholar-
ship tea m play schools that 
most people have never heard 
of like La Verne , Spring 
Harbor . Cal Baptist a nd 
Southern Cal College. I think if 
it was handled right students 
would fill our gym," Cun-
ningham added, " if we were 
winning and playing schools 
such as UC Irvine. UC Davis, 
Stanrord and Harvard." 

Scholarships 
Cunningham mentioned that 

many top quality athletes have 
expressed an interest in UCSD, 
but as soon as they lind out 
there are no athletic scholar-
ships they "lose all interest in 
coming here." 

"Since the defeat of athletic 
scholarships on the referendum 
of 1968, we have not even made 
a single attempt to be 
competitive in athletics," 
Cunningham feels. It is the 
coach' opinion that all athletic I 
policy is formulated without 
any regard to what any of the 
other schools UCSD competes

In Praise of Older Women has 
some good moments and is 
diverting, but it leaves no

characters are predominantly

Andros, despite his narrative

superficially; he goes from

with American accents and the 
sets and costumes are done in a 
nondescript style. The 
American accents could be 
forgiven if Andros' nationality 
wasn't repeatedly referred to, 
and if all the Canadians In the 
latter part of the rilm didn't 
have di stinct Canadian 
accents . 

The actors are all competent 
performers, but because of 
scriptual flaws they can only 
form outlines of the characters. 
Tom Berenger (soon to be seen 
in the Paul Newman role in 
Butch and Sundance) displays 
a pleasant screcn presence and 
gives a quietly humorou . 
performance. Karen BllIck and 
Susan Strasberg, as two of his 
conquests, deliver credible 
performances but they deserve 
better material. 

Luckily, George KlIczender 
directs the film in a light, 
humorous tone which prevents 
the film and the audience from 
taking the story too seriously. 

In Praise of Older Women has 
the saving graces of an 
lIttracli ve cast and a sense of 
humor, but overall it fails to 
achieve substance or depth .

and Latin America seem sure 
to be supplier of mas es of 
students . 

Is the pos ibility of America 
as a mas cducutional factory 
economically ound? 

It is Iikcly that the United 
States enjoys an economic 
" comparutive advantage" in 
the production of higher-
educlltion service on a mass 
scale. This meuns that the real 
economic costs of educating a 
student , measured by the 
acrificed alternatives of doing 

somet hing e lse with the 
r e source dedicated to 
educatio n. are probably 
relative ly lower in the United 
States than in other countries. 

And while we remain 
c ompetitive in service 
industries like education. it is 
a lso abundantly clear that the 
United State uffers equally 
s trong comparative di ad-
vantages in the produ tion of 
clothing . cololt::television ets, 
e lectrical a nd . photographic 
equipment. smull automobilcs , 
a nd a host of other manu-
fllctured products. 

For maximum production. 
incomes , and living standards, 
countries hould pe ia lize in 
those produ ts in which they 
have a comparative advan-
tage. and they should abandon 
those in which they have a 
cOlllpa ralive disadvantuge.

. Changes Doubtful 
Cunni ngham doe realize 

that it is "bad timing" right

,... 12 I . The Qu.chn 

ESt1cJ:~ts Have Power Here 
Says Lobbyist in Academia 

By Headlerbell FODI 
One person has an " awful 

lot" of power to change things 
at UCSD . 'ifthey scream," said 
Margot Temperau, this year's 
Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs of UCSD (ASUCSD). 
"The student lobby at UCSD 
has the most student involve-
ment of any UC campus." For 
Tempereau, at least, the recent 
months have been a time of 
intense activity in UC student 
arrairs. 

Tempereau ran for her 
position because she "wanted 
to do something in terms of 
improving UCSD," she said, 
adding that she has worked for 
cause " only if they benefit the 
students at large ... 

Her previou xperience as 
an editor for CAPE entailed 
reading many student' 

comments which helped her 
under tand " how student 
think." he remarked. In her 
opinion, students " are u ually 
more honest on the back of the 
form where they write their 
own comments." 

While working for CAPE 
Tempereau found "a 
noticeable decline in the quality 
of education provided to 
undergraduate .. at UCSD. She 
attributed this decli ne to 
"increased enrollment num-
bers, decreased library hours 
and program changes caused 
by Proposition 13." 

Library hours were notcutby 
as much as was threatened and 
Tempereau see thi as " one of 
the major achievements" of 
her term of office. The reprieve 
was brought about. she said. by 

"writing letter to the right 
people. and a lot of talking on 
committees ... 

Tempereau takes seriously 
her responsibility of repre-
senting the students' point of 
view in the UCSD Academic 
Senate and other academic 
committees. "Talking on 
committees was something I 
had never done before, " she 
said. " I have had to learn it. " 

The importance of students 

Hyman 'Harassed' 
fo r Mil itary Past 

AS Student Welfare Com-
missioner Barry Hyman was 
arrested for the third time on 
military charges last week and 
was given an early release 
from the San Di ego County Jail 
four days later. 

Hyman , who has been trying 
to get a military discharge 
since 1975, was arrested in the 
Student Center on charge 
stemming from his release 
from military duty. 

Hyman called the arrest 
"harassment" by the military 
and said he does not " have too 
much control over the situ-
ation ." 

After leaving military duty in 
Vietnam in 1974 as a 

Conscientious Objector (CO) , 
Hym a n has been court-
martialed and arrested by the 
military three times. 

According to Hyman. his Air 
Force Commander had given 
him permission to return to the 
U.S . But despite his numerous 
petitions to be recognized by 
the military as a CO and to 
receive a discharge, he said, 
the military has put him on 
active reserves. 

Hyman refuses to participate 
in the reserves. 

"They pick me orr the streets 
wh never they want," Hyman 
commented. " I don't under-
stand their psyche." 

organizing a collective 
respon e to academic policy 
was stressed by Tempereau. 
who finds that most of the time 
she spends at the ASUCSD 
office is taken up with "writing. 
talking, getting together on 
positions. " 

Tempereau is particularly 
pleased about student response 
to the threatened denial of 
tenure to Dr. Emory Tolbert of 
the History Department.
