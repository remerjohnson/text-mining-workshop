Former Medical Student 
Pleads Guilty To Murder 
By SETH SLATER 
Senior StajfWriter 

FOllller UCSD medical school student 
Charlie Richardson brought a sudden end to 
his murder trial proceedings when he pleaded 
gUilty last Friday to the charge of voluntary 
man laughter in the 1988 strangulation death 
of hi wife. 

Richardson changed his plea from not 
guilty after the' District Attorney' office 
agreed to reduce the charge against him 
from first degree murder to the lesser charge 
of man laughter. The unexpected reversal 
came Friday morning after UCSD Professor 
of Pediatrics Seth Asser gave key testimony 
for the prosecution. 

According to prosecutor Laurie Roonie, 
Asser's expert medical testimony was used 
to establish that the bum-like injuries found 
on Richardson's little fingers at the time of 
his arrest could have been caused by a tele-
phone cord, the instrument suspected to 
have been used in the murder.

A.S. Officials 
Reach Cultural 
TG Agreement 
By BRYAN DIAS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Feuding A.S. President John Ramirez 
and Programming Commissioner Matt Sch-
nurer have come to a resolution over the 
programming of culturally diverse TG ,after 
it appeared that the administration would 
cancel the March 9 TG. 

Ramirez and Schnurer said they reached 
the agreement after meeting for several hours 
Tuesday. 

"We were able to clear up a number of 
issues. We are both satisfied and comfort-
able with the results," Ramirez aid. 

However, neither Schnurer nor Ramirez 
would de cribe the content of their agree-
ment, saying they intended to reveal their 
plan and intent in separate letters to the 
Guardian.

The autopsy performed on the victim 
revealed that Maria Richardson, whose body 
was found at her work place in the 200 block 
of West Washington Street in El Cajon in 
December 1988, was strangled to death by a 
curved ligature, or wire. A long telephone 
cord was found near the victim's body. 

Students Debate Third College Renaming 

A detective who investigated the homi-
cide testified last year in a preliminary hear-
ing that Richardson claimed that the mark 
found on his right little finger was a result of 
a cooking bum. According to the detective, 
Richardson offered no explanation for the 
mark on his other little finger. 

According to Rooney, however, Asser's 
testimony on Friday indicated that 
Richardson 's injuries were "more consis-
tent with friction burns" than with contact 
bums of the type resulting from cooking 
accidents. 

Richardson's subsequent change of plea 
came as a particularly disquieting surprise 
to the victim's family, several of whom 
wept openly during Monday's Superior

Students discussed renaming Third Col-
lege for over two hours at last Monday's 
Third College Town Meeting. Although 
some proposals were more popular than 
others, no consensus was reached. 

Among the twelve name proposals, 
Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Freedom, 
Sequoia, and Sojourner Truth, along with a 
proposal to keep the name Third College, re-
ceived the most support. 

The Third College Naming Committee, 
which was appointed by Third College Pro-
vost Cecil Lytle, will select the name. The 
committee consists of one Third College 
alumnus, five students, three faculty and 
one staff member. 

After the naming committee selects a 
name, they will send it to Lytle for approval. 
IfLytJe approves the Third College Naming 

Committee's submission, it must also be 
approved by the Campuswide Naming 
Committee, Chancellor Richard Atkinson, 
and the UC Regents. 

Several people at the meeting expressed 
concern that the committee will select the 
name, rather than have a popular vote by stu-
dents. 

According to Third CoUegeCouncil Chair 
Paul Lanning, many students are "concerned 
about the way that the name is going to be 
arrived at. I don't think a lot of students are 
happy with the idea of the committee con-
cept. 

"A lot of students came up to me after the 
meeting and have come up to me in the past 
wanting to have a vote of some ort. While 
I don't know if that's the best way to arrive 
at a conclusion, I think it 's a necessary part 
of the process," Lanning said. 

At the Town Meeting, Lytle said that in 
the past elections concerning the name is-

Revelle In Serious Condition After Surgery 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior StajfWriter 

Professor Roger Revelle was reported to be in serious but 
stable condition yesterday at the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest, after undergoing a triple coronary bypass and aortic 
valve replacement surgery. 

Revelle, after whom Revelle College is named, entered the 
hospital last Thursday after complaining of not feeling well, 
according to hospital spokesman Nancy Stringer. 

The surgery was later performed on Monday night, Stringer 
said. 

"He's improving .... He's off the respirator, and awake and 
alert. The word we have is that he's making good progress," 
Stringer said. Revelle remains in intensive care. 

"We hope he'll be home in a week to 10 days," said Christa 
Beran, Revelle's ecretary. 

The last two classes of the STP A 157 seminar, which Revelle 
has taught this quarter, will be supervised by another professor, 
Beran said. 

Revelle has remained active since a pacemaker was implanted 
in his chest last September by teaching classes, writing, and 
attending several scientific conferences, Beran said. 

"He's continuing to comment and lecture and write on the 
greenhouse warming situation," Beran added. 

Revelle, one of the founders ofUCSD in the 19605, was director 
of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography from 1950-1964. He has 
also served as president of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, a post now held by Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson, Beran said. 

In recent years, Revelle has taught political science and science, 
technology, and public affairs classes here, in addition to serving 
as director emeritus of Scripp Institute. 

sue, voter turnout was low. 
"I don ' t think votes tell us anything," 

Lytle said. 
However. Lanning suggested that hav-

ing a vote would be important. 
"A lot of students feel that they should be 

able to vote. I don't know if the assumption 
that because students haven't voted in the 
past means that they won 't this time is valid 
or not." 

First-year Third student Cecelia Lucero 
said that she felt the student body should 
choose the college's name. 

"I think they should put faith in the stu-
dents and let us vote," she said. 

But Lytle indicated that the lack of a 
popular vote on the issue did not mean that 
the students have no input into the college's 
final name. 

"I want to make sure that we're aware 
that we are participating in a representative 
democracy. In light of the fact that we 
clearly cannot get a participatory dem~Â­
racy to work ... to get a significant number 
of people to vote on this issue, then we have 
to have a representative democracy," Lytle 
said. 

Third ophomore Shyam Srinivas aid 
that an election could be both good and bad. 

"It's good because it will keep people 
who are uninfolllled and people who do not 
care from clouding the issue. It' bad be-
cause the people who are not present at [last 
Monday' Town Meeting] will not be heard," 
Sriniva aid. 

Dan Hallin, associate professor in the 
communications department and member 
of Third College Naming Committee ex-
plained hi belief that the naming committee 
would make the final name choice. 

"I think the procedure that [LytleJ envi-
ioned was that the naming committee. after

UCSB Rec Center Approved With 
60.3 Percent Of Student Vote 

Ending four years of debate and failed campaigns, UC 
Santa Barbara students decided bigger facilities are in the 
fut ure of the campu and voted to increa e fees for the 
next 31 years to expand the University Center and build 
more recreational facilities. 

Receiving 60.3 percent approval in a two-day special 
election, the University Center/Recreation Center (UCen! 
RecCen) fee proposal passed with 4,029 " yes" votes. 
Only 2,657 voters, 39.7 percent, cast " no" ballot . Of the 
18,174 eligible student voters at UCSB. 6,686- 36.8 
percent- participated in the special two-day election. 

Similar expansion proposals in Fall 1986 and Spring 
1988 failed to win approval. Under a sliding scale adopted 
by the Associated Students Legislative Council in No-
vember 1988, this week's election required an approval 
margin of 50.02 percent, provided there was a turnout of 
29 percent or greater. Previously. a two-thirds majority 
was required for fee-increase measures, regardless of the 
number of voters. 

Option Two of the referendum, which will give 
students a $44.70 quarterly fee increase beginning Fall 
Quarter 1994, passed with 3,077 votes. or 50.8 percent. 
Option One, which would have graduated fees annual\y 
beginning in 1991 with a quarterly $10 increase, re-
ceived 2,983 votes, or 49.2 percent. 

UCSB in-state undergraduate students currently pay 
$523 per quarter, while in-state graduate students pay 
$510 per quarter. 

Students who have campaigned on both sides of the 
issue expressed little surprise over election results. 

"I think it's great. It' s a clear mandate" of the student 
population, ASUCSB President Mike Stowers said. "The 
students realized the need and the quality of the project. 
We're going to have some excellent facilities. We, as 
UCSB students. deserve them." said Stowers, a member 
of Students for Improved Facilities. 

"It's sort of what I expected," said Eric Jensen, chair 
of" o! on WreckCen," a group opposed to the expan-
sion proposal . ''I'm really sad [supporters of the project) 
piggybacked the UCen on the RecCen 's back," Jensen 

Calvin and Hobbes 

said, referring to what he believes wa strong support for 
a RecCen, but not an expanded UCen. 

The expanded UCen is de igned to include a Multi-
cultural Center, more meeting rooms, banquet hal\s, 
extra lounges and eating areas, a larger bookstore, and 
additional food outlets. The RecCen would include two 
swimming pools, a new weight room, and a gymnasium 
the size of the current Events Center.

Berkeley Co-Op Residents Vow 
To Take Eviction Fight To Court 

Lingering tenants of UC Berkeley ' s entrenched Bar-
rington Hall tudent cooperative said recently that they 
intend to stay in the building while protesting the house 's 
closure in court. 

Representatives for nearly 40 past and present Bar-
rington residents, speaking on the UCB campus, de-
nounced last semester's co-op membership vote to close 
the house and introduced the lawyer handling the case for 
15 of the remaining tenants. 

" We are not going to go away," said Rebecca Ekberg, 
a current tenant of the 180-room house at 2315 Dwight 
Way. "We have no other recourse at this point than to 
take [Barrington's closure] to court." 

More than half of the 1,400 members of the Univer-
sity Students Cooperative Association (UCSA), which 
owns 17 co-op houses in Berkeley. voted Nov. 8 to shut 
down Barrington this spring. 

Proponent of the closure aid they thought the resi-
dents could never stop the noise, property damage, and 
drug dealing that resulted in numerous lawsuits against 
the USCA and elicited complaints from city officials. 

But the remaining Barrington residents said yesterday 
that the closure vote reflects inaccurate and biased infor-
mation about their house's activities. 

"The referendum [to close) was based more on frus-
tration than on real evidence," said Ekberg, claiming that 
the publicly stated opinion of co-op central-level manag-
ers led to the closure more than did hardships induced by 
nefarious activities on the premises. 

Residents also resent the positioning of security guards 
in front of the building, she said. 

Berkeley-based tenant lawyer Sam Trosow, while 
dodging questions asked by members of the press corps, 
said he knows grounds on which Barrington residents

can appeal their eviction. 
"There are some very legitimate and very valid de-

fenses for these ... actions," Trosow said. "Every tenant 
has to be concerned with the poison atmosphere around 
this." 

The lawyer said that since Berkeley rent control ap-
plies to co-op housing, the USCA management needs to 
find specific reasons to evict al\ 166 residents who lived 
in Barrington Hal\ last semester. 

But the co-op management has also hired an attorney 
to back up its side of the case, which is due for delibera-
tion in the Berkeley/Albany Municipal Court sometime 
next week. 

"We have the legal right to ask them to leave after 
their contracts expire." said USCA manager Vicki 
Cucarola "They were given 30 days notice to move out 
of their co-op or to move [out of the USCA]."

A.S. Extinguishes Fireworks 
By MARY BErry HEARD 
Senior SfajJWrifer 

TheASUCSD decided last night 
not to allocate funding for a fire-
works display at the up-coming 
Cultural Quest Festival. 

The decision not to fund the 
fireworks was based on several 
objections, the main points being 
that the AS. could not afford the 
$1000 needed for the three to five 
minute fireworks display.

Court proceedings. 

"The whole time, the family 
was backing [Richardson] up be-
cause they didn't think he did it. 
Then. all ofa sudden, he changes 
his plea," said a courtroom source 
who wished to remain anonymous. 

In pleading guilty to voluntary 
manslaughter, Richardson effec-
tively reduced his possible sen-
tence to a 12-yearprison tenn with 
a possibility for parole after six 
years, a punishment Superior Court 
Judge Judith Haller said she in-
tends to hand down when sentenc-
ing occurs April 6. Had Richardson 
been convicted of the original 
charge of first degree murder. he 
would have faced 25 years to life in 
prison. 

According to Rooney, "when 
someone kills in the heat of pas-
sion, it's manslaughter," and prior

The entire budget for additional 
events at the Cultural Quest Festi-
val began as $2,077.50 but was 
split into two sub-budgets, one for 
the fireworks and one for the other 
addi tional events. 

Whil e the s ub-budge t of 
$I,W7.50 was passed without 
question, the $1000 for fireworks 
was debated heavily. 

Maya Cameron of the Cultural 
Quest Festival Committee said " the 
Sun-God Festival has been al\o-

to Richardson 'S plea change, the 
prosecution had no evidence point-
ing to a crime of passion. She added 
that in the absence of such evi-
dence, her office had no choice but 
to charge Richardson with pre-
meditated murder. The outcome, 
she said, "was fair to everyone 
concerned." 

Rooney went on to say that she 
felt comforted by the fact that 
California State Board of licens-
ing regulations will prevent 
Richardson, who was a fourth-year 
medical student at the time of his 
arrest, from practicing medicine in 
the future. She added that "a lot of 
concerns were satisfied" by the 
outcome of the case. 

Richardson's attorney had no 
comment on the plea reversal. 
Richardson, in accordance with San 
Diego County Jail regulations. was 
not able to recei ve v isitors or tele-
phone calls as of press time Wed-
nesday night.

Many AS. members expressed 
a concern for the state of the budget, 
fearing that by al\owing the Cul-

extra $1000 they would prevent 
future programs from receiving 
sufficient funding .

A.S. Programming Commissioner Matt Schnurer 
ous plans for TG programming 
were wrong and lacked cultural 
diversity, and that everything was 
"okay now." 

IfSchnurerdid not do so, Tucker 
would not allow any TOs until Fall 
Quarter, Schnurer said. 

However, according to Tucker, 
the administration was instead 
concerned about the number of 
TOs in the near future. 

"With the one this Friday, on 
the ninth, and then one the follow-
ing week, we were concerned with 
the idea of three TGs in a row," 
Tucker said. 

One early incident in the feud, 
according to infonnedsources, was 
the controversial appointment by 
Ramirez of Vanness Harris as the 

Ndr,-(Lth 

presidential representative to 
Schnurer 's programming commit-
tee . Harris had said prior to being 
confinned to his appointment that 
he would be "a thorn in 
[Schnurer'sJ side." 

Sources said that another event 
which inflamed the conflict was an 
incident at a recent programming 
committee meeting when Harris 
allegedly accused another black 
student, Kim Phillips, of "know-
ing nothing of her culture" when 
she defended Schnurer' s stance on 
TG programming. 

The most recent incident. the 
direct involvement of Tucker, 
caused the resolution between the

A.S. Watch 

The Bigger Problem 
The issue of the A.S . and TGs has received a great deal of 

attention recently - as it should - but it really is part of a larger 
problem: the lack of a coherent A.S. policy, accompanied by a 
lack of leadership. 

The list of A.S. "accomplishments" this year is mostly a nega-
tive one: a polarized council, fiscal irresponsibility, favoritism. 
partisan politics, and a preoccupation with irrelevant issues. The 
blame for this is spread throughout the Council; there are voices 
of reason, but their opinions are often squelched by the mudsling-
ing of special interests. 

A typical example is the programming issue. When the "Elvis 
Week" proposal was being debated, an A.S. member who up-
ported it was pas ed a note accusing him of being a racist . In a 
Programming Committee meet-
ing, Vanness Harris accused an-
other black committee member 
of being ignorant of her culture, 
causing her considerable emo-
tional dure s. When someone 
asked if it was necessary for 
Yolanda King and a friend to be 
flown to UCSD first class, in-
stead of coach, am ember of co un-
cil said, "It looks like someone wants to send Mrs. King to the 
back of the bus." These sorts of immature and unprofessional 
actions have no place in student government. 

A.S. funding decisions have also been distorted by such 
actions. The A.S. is supposed to represent all of the students, and 
act objectiveiy. But this is not what this year 's council has done; 
funding decisions are heavily influenced by partisan politics. For 
example, the Pro-Choice "Forum." The name was changed from 
"Rally" to seem less political, but it still will have no Pro-Life 
speakers, so it isn't much of a forum. The funding of this event 
sets a dangerous precedent of funding groups which are advocat-
ing a politically charged position. The A.S. neutrality. and 
credibility, has been seriously damaged. 

The A.S. has also been fiscally irresponsible. In previous 
years, the A.S. Council has left at least $10,000 for the next 
Council. This "cushion" is disappearing quickly this year; there 
is less than $40,000 left, and Spring Quarter will bring many 
costs. The Council is left with two choices: tightening their belts 
and watching the permies, or leaving next year's council without 
any cushion. The responsible choice is clear: the A.S. should 
insure that they fulfill their responsibility and save money for 
next year's council. 

The Council has also been spending its time on ridiculous 
issues. They debated a resolution calling for the United States to 
stop intervening in Central America for over half an hour, and 
they declared a "Nelson Mandela Day" for next year. These 
causes may be noble, but it is unclear what effect the A.S. really 
has on U.S. foreign policy. The Council should not be wasting 
their limited lime debating issues which will have little impact on 
students. 

What makes all of this particularly disheartening is that there 
are issues which the A .S . needs to deal with. Parking, the rights 
of s tudent workers, the spending of parking fees - all of these 
have received lillie attention. The A.S . has become divided and 
ineffectual, and is marked now by members grandstanding in 
hopes of enhancing their chances in the next election. It's time -
long past time - for the A.S. to put aside the silliness and 
squabbling, and deal with some real issues. The Council has 
"'asted enough time already. 

Holmes Not To Blame For Media Delays 
Editor: 

"The whole thing is insane, but 
you can bet that whoever wins the 
election, I will attack him. 1 will 
wait the customary time after his 
swearing in for his hand to drop, 
and then I will attack." 

- Mort Saul 

did not come acro s to many (if 
any) readers. 

Let it be said in this "respect-
able" paper that Mike Holmes is 
lIot the individual responsible for 
the delays in the delivery of the 
Media's new computer system. 
We wish we could place the entire 
blame on him, or anyone for that 
matter. We wish we :::C'uld find a 
scapegoat in Mike, or Randy 
Woodard, or Tom Tucker, but in 
truth, the only real entity that can 
be said to be at the bottom of all 

this is " the system" (and now we 
sound like New Indicator staf-
fers) . 

Apathy, miscommunication , 
red tape, over-departmentaliza-
tion, and poor planning all down 
the line in the A.S. and elsewhere 
has caused the numerou delays, 
not Mike Holmes. So don' t key 
his car, steal his TV, or spit in his 
beer for our sake; he'sonourside.

KoakJ Editors-in-Chief 

As comedian Mort Saul so 
eloquently tated, public figures 
are automatic targets for ridicule, 
insult, and the like. The Koala is 
no exception to this rule, and oc-
casionally we wind up bashing 
someone without actually intend-
ing to do so. 

In our last issue, "Hey A.S. 
Pro-Choice Forum Funding 

Where The Hell Are Our Comput-
ersT' we printed an open letter to 
Media Commissioner Mike 
Holmes, threatening him with a 
Koala-style lynching if our be-
loved Macs are not delivered be-
fore the end of the quarter. 

The point of the letter was to 
say that it would have been very 
easy to blame the whole situation 
on Mike, but since he is such a 
nice guy and he is truly working 
hard for the Alternative Media 's 
best interest, we were cutting him 
some slack. Unfortunately, this 

Editor: 
We are writing in response to 

Anton Bittner's opinion in the Feb. 
20 edition of The Guardian. Mr. 
Binner claims that the A.S. "made 
the decision that the UCSD stu-
dents. as a whole, now support the 
pro-choice movement." 

This argument is completely 
illogical. 

The purpose of the A.S. allo-
cating money to student organiza-
tions is to provide the opportunity 
for students to be exposed to new 
ideas. 

Progress in South Africa 
Editor: 

The South African government must be held accountable for the 71 
prisoners who died while detained without charges under South Africa's 
stringent security laws. . 

Just as the Soviet Union must be held responSible for the thousands 
of men and women sentenced to "mental hospitals" or the gulag, with 
little hope of ever regaining their freedom. 

Mikhail Gorbachev, however, by recognizing past atrocities and 
moving quickly to abolish them, has rapidly established himself as a 
leader dedicated to constructive reform. 

President De Klerk has similarly proved himself to be the new leader 
in southern Africa. His swift decision to order a thorough investigation 
into the recent prison death of Clayton Sistole underscores hi~ effort~ to 
clean up the police force and crack dow~ on strong-ru:m police tachcS. 
He has released political prisoners, curtaIled human nghts abuses, and 
called for a new constitution that will allow social and political freedom 
for all Sout1. Africans. 

The Challenges facing these two leaders are formidable indeed, yet 
bolh men have met them with courage and determination. Unable to 
change the past, they strive to create a new future. . 

TIle United States, recognizing Sovietachievements, ls strongly sup-
porting Gorbachev' s efforts to institutionalize his reforms. h is lime for 
the United States to lend the same support to the government and people 
of South Africa.

Once hearing these various 
viewpoints, students can make in-
telligent decisions on their own. 

The $739 allocation the A.S. 
made to the March 2 "Pro-Choice 
Forum" by no means represents 
the student body's personal view. 
It merely allows the pro-choice 
movement to educate the UCSD 
community about a woman's right 
10 choose. 

It is up to the individual to 
attend the forum, think aboul what 
he or she has heard, and make a 
decision on one's own. 

The A.S. is nol condoning pro-
choice. Just as the A.S. allocates 
money to the Inter Varsity Chris-
tian Fellowship or the Union of 
Jewish Students, it is not implying 
that all students are either Chris-
tian or Jewish. Rather, the A.S. is 
providing students with the chance 
to explore beliefs and find out 
what is right for them. 

We welcome the anti-choice 
movement to organize and plan a 
forum of their own. 

We are open to hearing their 
views and would be there in full 
spirit. 

Contrary to what Binner says, 
the A .S. is representing its con-
stituents by giving student the 
opportunity to hear new ideas, 
controversial or not. God forbid 
we force students to think about a 
political issue!

Pollution of the UCSD Campus Shameful 
Editor: 

I recently had the pleasure to 
visit your campus and your new 
Price Center. It was very impre's-
sive compared to the old book-
store complex. Unfortunately, it 
does not look like it will stay that 
way long. 

This was my second visit. My 
first was just after the comlex was 
completed and my second was 
this past week. As a UC graduate, 
I was floored to see the amount of 
trash posted thoughout the com-
plex. There was not a post or a 
wall that did not seem to be marred 

with tape and multi-colored paper 
telling me to buy this, go here or 
protest that. 

Yes, higher education is the 
seat of almost all freedoms we 
know and usually the first to tell 
us, as a society, when something 
has gone awry, from politiCS to 
pollution, but this privilege is a 
double-edged sword. Higheredu-
cation is also the seat of "example. " 

We often scream about the 
wrong brought about by others 
around us, especially those out-
side the school walls, yet we can-
not live by many of the same rules

we scream about. The pollution 
falling from the walls because of 
the wind and rain was shameful. 
The visual pollution placed on such 
a beautiful project defies respon-
sible reasoning. As I walked 
throughout the campus, I found 
that this pollution was not specific 
to just the Price Center, but was 
pandemic to UCSD. 

The privilege to be where you 
are today, and to treat your sur-
roundings accordingly is an abuse 
in sensibility and a terrible ex-
ample to the rest of the world. No 
wonder the Exxon Valdez spilled 
its milJions of gallons with little 
remorse; the pollution I saw on 
campus, the bedrock of 
tomorrow's citizens, was in itself 
pollution of the same caliber. 
Shame. Shame.

OPINION 5 

Media. Suicide Coverage 
Editor: 

After the recent suicide of a UCSD student was reported by 
your paper, Mr. Gregory Mathiews wrote you ("Printing Suicide 
Story was Irresponsible," Feb. 22) complaining thatsuchjoumal-
ism was irresponsible and prompts more suicides to occur because 
it glorifies the act While this can be true of any news story (be it 
murder, terrorism, rape, prank calls, etc.), I feel that these stories 
must be reported since we must be reminded of thei r unfortunate 
existence. 

Suicide is a difficult issue for most people to discuss. It is an 
even touchier subject when it occurs to our peers. What we need 
most of all when such a tragedy occurs is to keep the channels of 
coDDllunicationopen so that we can discuss oUT feelings and better 
understand why such troubling tragedies still occur in society. 

"Dead Poets Society ," a movie that has been nominated for an 
Academy Award, deals somewhat with the subject of suicide. The 
movie. starring Robin Williams, has a student commit suicide 
because he can't please his parents. While suicide may be caused 
by chemical imbalances in the brain, suicide more likely happens 
to individuals who are unable to cope effectively with stress or 
problems in their lives. 

Although "Dead Poets Society" is an excellent movie, it fails 
to address the other complex problems associated with suicide: 
sucb as why it only occurs in certain individuals and what can be 
done to prevent it. Movies, magazines, and newspapers are all 
excellent media to address such complex issues as suicide. 

While it may be argued that reports or movies cause a glorifi-
cation (and thus an increase) ofsuicide statistics,l believe we not 
only need media cO'ierage and awareness of such tragic OCCUT-
rences, but abo more analysis and insight into why they still occur 
today, particularly among young people. 

UCSD bas one of the highest suicide Jates for a campus of its 
size, and so I feel we should all be made aware that such tragedies 
do occur, even in a beautiful campus such as ours. News media, 
such as The UCSD Guardian, usually don', intentionally resort to 
glorification when dealing with tragedies like suicide (although 
some newspapers have done so in the past). 

But what the news agencies and other media need to strive for 
in theirrqxn1Sis to educate the public more. and not just report the 
facts. It is in tbis regard that The Guardian has let its readers down 
and did not sufficiently deal with the tragic death of David 
Simennan. An improved role would be that of educator, and nOf 
just that of reporter. 

Perbaps a more in-depth aniole on suicide should be the next 
imPQrt8Dt item on The Guardian's agenda. Otherwise, all we will 
bcgettina from The Guardian is reports of tragic occurrences and 
not infonnalivo journalism.

Ignorance of Tijuana is Prevalent 
Editor: 

While reading the feature on 
"A Saturday Along Revolucion" 
(Feb. 22), I was not urprised to 
learn how ignorant Lisa and the 
construction worker are. It is not 
surprising that Lisa and the con-
struction worker only go to Tijuana 
to drink. What else could they do? 
Meet the people in different parts 
of town? Leam about a different 
cultural background? Or maybe 
volunteer to help the people build 
a humble hou e? No, that would 
be asking them too much. Be-

side, they only care to "PARTY" 
on Revolucion. 

Lisa feels afraid of "so many 
MexicansaroundwhospeakSpan-
ish." Well, Lisa. let me enlighten 
your sad ignorance just a bit with 
a couple of pointers: First. Mex-
ico is full of Mexicans. and yes, 
they speak Spanish, 

Second, I am sorry to know 
that you don ' tlike Mexicans that 
hang around "everywhere" in San 
Diego due to the fact that they will 
break into your home.

listening to the views of the Third 
College community at the Town 
Meeting would then make a deci-
sion." 

Hallin noted that although there 
is a "planned procedure, as with 
any plan, it is not absolutely set in 
cement. If somebody were to say 
'wait. we have another suggestion' 
I think everybody involved would 
listen to the other suggestion and 
the plan might be changed." 

Lanning encouraged people to 
attend the upcoming Third Col-
lege Council meeting on Monday 
to express theirconcems about the 
name issue. 

If there was a "large, widespread 
feeling among students that they 
should be able to vote on this issue â¢ 
then &he Council would have to 
forward that to the Naming Com-
minee." he said. 

"lbe Council could encourage 
a vote to take place or have some 
kind of role in sening up a poll ... 
to get people's opinion on the 
naming issue," Lanning continued. 

Lytle indicated that a popular 
vote to decide the name of Third 
College would have no real valid-
ity in any case. 

"Assuming we did have a vote, 
and 300 people [one-tenth the Third 

A.S.

Festival. the A.S. had set a prece-
dent. and that it would be unfair to 
not fund the Cultural Quest Festi-
val fireworks. 

" The A.S. has a responsibility 
to back [The Cultural Quest Festi-
val Committee] up ... You can't 
say yes to one son and not the 
other," said Ruben Duran, Third 
Sophmore Senator. 

After much debate, the A.S. took 
a roll-call vote; the bill was de-
feated, JO for and 11 against. 

At the beginning of the meet-
ing, Evan Kirvin, chair of the Judi-
cial Board, announced that the 
Judicial Board decided that fund-
ing the Pro-Choice Funding was 
unconstitutional, but they will hold 
an emergency meeting this eve-
ning at 8:00 to decide whether or 
not to enforce their decision. 

The Judicial Board requested a 
postponement of the Pro-Choice 
Forum until it could be proven that 
opposing viewpoints would be 
represented at the Forum. 

According to Christy McGrath 
of Students for Pro-Choice. the 
Forum will still go on as planned.

that mean?" he asked. "The name of this coUege is 
pan of the message that infects the 
community with a positivedescrip-
tion of who we are and what we 
believe in," said Lytle. 

"If someone can teU me a fair 
way of guaranteeing that there will 
be a major turnout ... then I think 
we'd have a fair vote. But the way 
that the vote has been judged and 
handled and given preference in 
the past has not been democratic," 

According to Lytle, the name 
"Third" does not send out that 
message, which is why the coJlege 
must have a new name. Lytle added.

"Hey, it's the Mall ! No gray glass and concrete hive, this. 

A perfect people-place to pause-ponderÂ·peruse-plead-pick up-
play, and it's never the same facade twice . .. " 

The Orchid & Onion Community Awareness Program jury 
made this ~omment on a building complex it reviewed last 
year, adding that the remark explained why the complex was 
awarded an Architecture Orchid. The j ury was not referring to 
actual malls such as University Towne Center or Horton 
Plaza, but instead to UCSD's own Price Cen;ter. 

'' It is like the mall . You've got your movie theater, infor-
mation booth, fast food places," said Warren College student 
Su Lee. "Amidst all the lecture halls and libraries is this 
getaway from academics- a place to eat and relax with 
friends. " 

Planning forthe $18.6 million new student center, funded 
by the Sol Price family and student fees, began in 1983. 

"UCSD needed a large central plaza, a special place, where 
a wide variety of people could gather," explained architect 
John Sturla. 

"The rapidly growing student population indicated that we 
needed more facilities, a place to do the sorts of things we do 
here now," added Paul Eykamp, vice chair of the University 
Center Board (UCB). the committee composed of students, 
faCUlty , and taff re ponsible for the Price Center 's planning. 

According to Sturla. "The students made it clear that they 
didn ' t just want a concrete building, and Herb [McLaughlin, 
the principal architect] came up with the idea of using the

outer stone." 
The efforts of Sturla, McLaughlin, and administrators, 

including Jim Carruthers (associated with a local San Diego 
firm), Tom Tucker (assistant vice chancellor), and Bob 
Weilage (director of architecture & project management), 
resulted in today 's Price Center, located on what is soon to be 
the heart of campus. 

"It is an integrated, interactive center on campus and indica-
tive of the way people think today," Weilage said. 

The 120,000 square-foot complex officially opened last 
April. The Price Center consists of two- and three-story build-
ings grouped around a central plaza which houses, in addition 
to a study lounge and conference rooms, a variety of mall-like 
features: the 5OD-seat theater, six fast food restaurants, an 
information booth, a record store, a computer store, a travel 
center, a post office, a games area, and a box office. 

A two-Story university bookstore occupies a large bulk of 
the Price Center. According to Lee, "A bookstore normally 
reiterates academics, but this one doesn't too much. It's like a

Bookstore's 
Stock Is 
Rising 
UCSD Store Is 17th 
Largest in Nation 
By ADAM LEVY 
Staff Writer 

Far from being modest in size 
or sheer volume of books, the 
UCSD Bookstore has emerged as 
the largest bookstore south of Los 
Angeles. Paul Mares, the director 
of the store, has overseen its trans-
formation since its opening- 24 
years ago. 

Mares regards with pride its 
17th ranking among the largest 
bookstores in the country. Both 
theacquisitionofmorethan 80,000 
regular stock books and the con-
struction of a store with 50,000 
square feet have been some of the 
changes that have affected the 
ranking, Mares said. 

He said the old bookstore un-
derwent constant physical expan-
sion before the bookstore at the 
Price Center was constructed. 
When it first opened, it only occu-
pied part of the building located 
across from the Registar, he said. 

"In 24 years, there were 10 
expansions prior to this one. We 
took that building over piecemeal," 
Mares said. 

Preparation to move to the Price 
Center started three years in ad-
vance, he said, and involved a 
gradual increase in book ti tie se-
lection. 

He said it is a long process to 
expand book volume by any sig-
nificant degree. 

"Every title that we carry is an 
individual decision that has to be 
made by a buyer," Mares said. 

The bookstore's focus has been 
to provide an extensive title list of 
academic books that would serve 
the needs of the University com-
munity, he said. 

The bookstore, although re-
quired to show a profit, does not 
consider profit-making a major 
concem. 

He noted that book turnover at 
the bookstore is rather low when 
compared to privately-owned 
booksto&:es. 

"A business that is organized 
to maximize profit could not stand 
the low inventory tumover that 
we can," he said. 

The store subsidizes its book 
department with profits made 
through other sectors of the store. 
the most lucrative being clothes 
with the UCSDemblem. The store 
receives its highest return on the 
clothes- 40-50 percent of the 

. profit. The bookstore gets 40 per-
cent for general merchandise 
books. 25 percent for textbooks, 
and 10-17 percent for computers. 

"We need to do as good ajobas 
we can in the non-book areas be-
cause that's how we're going to 
subsidize building the bookstore,"

Thursday, March 1, 1990 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 9 

Misinformation About Growth is Rampant Tijuana Fourth, you claim the U.S is 
the best place in "the fucking 
world." It may be, but unfortu-
nately, it is filled with ignorant 
individuals like yourself. 

Editor: 
I realize that one of the inten-

tions of The Guardian is to in-
form the campus of events at 
UCSD, but to me it is apparent 
that most of the campus, faculty 
and staff included, are either 
completely ignorant or sadly mis-
informed when it comes to topics 
they should be very knowledge-
able about . I am not trying to say 
that there is not interest- only 
that there aren't many facts read-
ily available. Subsequently, vari-
ous rumors and gossip get started, 
which lead to general campus 
confusion. 

Only a few weeks ago, an ex-
ample of this confusi.->n took place 
on the Revelle Campus. One day, 
for no apparent reason, workers 
started to erect a cyclone fence 
around the grass areas on both 
sides of Urey Hall. Since cyclone 
fences usually denote construc-
tion, almost everyone assumed that 
a new building was going to be 
built. Thoughtsoflosingtheirtrees 
and grass did not sit well with

some students, and in only a few 
days a sign ~at said, "TAKE 
DOWN THE BERLIN FENCE" 
was draped along the cyclone 
divider. One very determined stu-
dent was even announcing that in 
just a few years, nobody would be 
able to watch the sunset through 
the trees due to the presence of a 
six-story biology building. 

All of these stu~nts and nu-
merous others must have felt terri-
bly ridiculous when they discov-
ered the fence around the park was 
only put up so the construction 
vehicles could have a safe place to 
be stored and operated. Construc-
tion wasn't taking place in the 
park area, but on the portion of 
land between Urey and Revelle 
Plaza. All of this could have been 
avoided ifonly someone had both-
ered to make the truth more widely 
known. 

The question that all of this 
brings to mind isn't who is to blame 
for the misinformation, but who 
should have taken responsibility 
for informing the campus in the 

firs t place. The so-called " Master 
Plan" is easy enough to get your 
hands on if you are determined, 
but it has undergone more changes 
than Michael Jackson's nose. All 
ofthe other information that gets 
around campus is basically ru-
mor. 

It is for this reason that I sug-
gest the following: the Regents 
should submit inf~rmat ion of all 
ground-breaking dates and loca-
tions to school newspapers. The 
newspapers could then publish the 
essential facts for their readers 
and the students could get angry 
for a legitimate reason. 

In the next couple of years, 
UCSD is going to be undergoing 
some radical growth. Most of the 
parking on campus is going to be 
eliminated to make room for build-
ings. Numerous small structures 
will be replaced with enormous 
complexes. How else can the stu-
dent body keep track of these 
changes if papers like The Guard-
ian don 't print the truth?

pointers: First, you felt like Mex-
ico was a Third World country. 
Well, Â·let me tell you that Mexico 
is a Third World country. 

Second, there is more to Mex-
ico than going to Baja in your 4lt4 
and your dirtbike to kick back on 
the beach and drink a lot of beer. 

Third, you suggest to "tear 
down the border and make Mex-
ico a part of the United States." 
Ever hear of "sovereignty?" I don't 
think so. How can you make such 
a stupid suggestion? What gives 
you the right to make everything 
"all-American, and go down to 
Honduras?" Who are you? 

In short, it is very depressing to 
see how people survi ve in Tijuana, 
a city of the Third World. BUt 
what is even sadder is to know that 
the U.S., being the wealthiest and 
most advanced country in the First 
World, has individuals like Lisa 
and the construction worker who 
lire ignorant. I, being Mexican, 
feel sorry for you two. 

P.S. Lisa, I forgot to wam you.

least expected and then I will take

Eykamp, " because there are 
rounded comers, the circular ele-
vator, yet sharp edges as well; but 
there's a general smoothness to it 
as a whole." This architecture is 
why Julie Schwant sees the Price 
Center somewhat as a shopping 
center. ''The architecture, the struc-
ture just makes it seem like one." 

"It's post-modem, very styl-
ized-reminds me of Horton 
Plaza," Dorothy Knapp added. 

Or maybe it 's the general at-
mosphere of the Price Center that 
links it to a mall. Borovoy said, 
"It's like a combination between 
Horton Plaza and Disneyland be-
cause of its festive atmosphere." 

Thursdays on the Green, when 
local and L.A. bands play every 
other Thursday, emphasize festiv-
ity, as do other speakers and per-
formers. Eykamp spoke highly of 
the Armorded Gazebo band in 
particular. "They actllll"Y set up a 
gazebo on the speaker' s platform," 
he said. 

Muir senior Mary Chatsworth 
described the Price Center's at-
mosphere as "busy but comfort-
able. I people-watch here often." 

"There's a lot of motion," said 
Lee. "Students, professors, em-
ployees, even I ittle kids sometimes, 
are all coming in and out carrying 
packages and grabbing a bit to eat. 
But there's a calm side to it as well 
like you see early in the morning at 
UTC." 

Warren student Michael Lahey 
sees the calm rather than hectic 
side of the Price Center: "I come 
here to relax with a cup of coffee, 
to have a table in the sun to sit at, 
and get seduced into buying french 
fries, "he said. 

Schwant added, "It's so light 
and airy here. It's open enough, 
but closed enough." 

The grass slope and trees around 
the food area "humanized the place 
where they were planted," accord-
ing to Lahey. 

The fountain, blanketing the 
south-west comer of the Price 
Center, "is soothing," said Sturla, 
" like Sitting by a stream in nature, 
or it serves as an acoustic white 
noise. People react well 10 water-
to the idea of something flowing." 

There was a "strong direction 
that people should flow through 
the complex," Sturla said. 

And flow people do: down the 
steps leading through the central 
plaza. in and out the various facili-
ties arranged in such a way that 
they are "stacked on top of each 
other and next to each other, giving

The computer sector, Mares 
said, is another area where profits 
are not apriority. 

"We try to get computers in 
students' hands," he said, adding 
that the computer area lost money 
during some years. 

Although the bookstore's assets 
are owned by the UC Regents, it is 
still run much like a privale busi-
ness, Mares said. 

"The Regents don't have any 
functional relationship with the 
store at all," Mares commented. 
He added although students write 
checks to theRegents, "that is only 
the name of the bank account." . 

The acquisition of all new 
books, overhead, and theconstruc-
lion of the new bookstore were 
funded through the profits of the 
store and loans secured through 
private sources. 

''There were no student fees and 
Sol Price didn't give any money to 
the bookstore." Mares said. The 
store secured a loan from a bank 
like any private business would, he 
said. 

In comparing the store to a pri-
vate company, Mares pointed out 
that since it is nOI financed by 
shareholders, the store has more 
autonomy in terms of increasing 
its book selection because it can 
use profits to buy more books and 
not pay stockholders.

Janet Beach said she feels the

"It was built with the comfort of 
bureaucrats in mind- not stu-
dents," she said. 

Beach said she was one of the

UCSD. The letter, which was pub-

Beach said the Price Center 
"isn't very soothing to me." 

She said she prefers the Student 
Center to the Price Center. 

"I'm into wood," Beach said 
With its various mall-like fa-

cilities, the Price Center hardly 
resembles the typical college stu-
dent center; it is also a "hangou,t" 
according to Victor Furer; "a place 
to come on first dates," according 
to Erika Hutchinson. Or the Price

cream, browse in the bookstore, or 
soak up some sun conveniently on

Tritons Travel to Nebraska for First Round of Playoffs 

Men's Hoop Regional on Saturday 
By MAITHEW ROCI-IIOS 
Staff Writer 

Saturday evening, the UCSD 
men's basketball team will put itself 
into the record books. For the first 
time in the chool's almo t thirty-
year history, the men's team will 
participate in post-season play. 

The Tritons are the third seed in 
the western portion of the playoffs 
and will face second-seeded and 
perennial powerhouse Nebraska 

Wesleyan in a 7:30 p.m. Central 
Standard Time (5:30 p.m. PST) 
matchup in Lincoln, Nebraska. 

Nebraska Wesleyan has been to 
the Division ill Final Four in four 
of the last six years. 

With a new head coach and no 
seniors in the starting lineup, 
Nebraska overcame what could 
have been a rebuilding year, as it 
compiled a 21-5 record - the re-
sultofacommitment to past coach-
ing schemes and an ability to score 
a lot of points, according to UCSD 
Head Coach Tom Marshall. 

NW averaged 87.6 points per 
game this season while surrender-
ing an average of 78. The team, 
from a small school of 1,200 stu-
dents, posted a 9-2 record in front 

of its home fan . 
By Division ill standards, the 

Nebra ka team is big. With a front 
line made up of a 6'8" center and 
two 6'6" forwards, NW keys its 
defense by looking to block shots. 

On offense, NW has two quick

guards that distribute the ball well 
and lead a fine perimeter shooting 
attack. 

CSU San Bernardino, which 
UCSD defeated three times this 
year, fell to NW by 40 points ear-
lier this season. But Marshall was 
quick to point out that CSUSB had 
several players injured at the time 
of that contest. 

In many ways, NW mirrors the 
Tritons. UCSD averaged 86.8 

point per game while giving up 
78, was l0-2 at home and 20-6 
overall, and features a front line 
that includes 6'8" Gordon McNeill 
and 6'7" Rick Batt. 

According to Marshall, the Tri-
tons will stick to the game plan that 
has brought them this far - in-
side-outside offensive motion and 
varying the defensive pressure as 
the game dictates. 

Marshall said, however, that 
defense will be the key to victory 
on Saturday. 

Marshall and his coaching staff 
feel that NW is the type of team 
that lets its opponents play their 
own game, but tries to overwhelm 
them with sheer fire power. 

The team looked sluggish in 
practice on Tuesday, but the 
coaches and players blamed mid-
terms and other distractions for the 
mediocre showing. 

Point guard Darvin Jackson 
finds himself "anxious," but men-
tally ready for Saturday's regional, 
whereas high-scoring shooting 
guard Tim Rapp believes it is time 
to prove that the Tritons are as 
good as their record indicates. 

Marshall thinks that the team 
will find the concentration it needs 
once it reaches Lincoln on Thurs-
day evening.

Tritons knock off University of San Diego, fall to Point Lorna Nazarene; now 4-6 
By JOHN ASUNCION 
Staff Writer 

At times throughout the season, 
baseball games are sometimes won 
by how many breaks a team gets. 

UCSD's 10-6 victory Tuesday 
over the University of San Diego 
saw the Tritons get several breaks 
to defeat the Toreros decisively. 

Yesterday, Point Lorna Naza-
rene got all the breaks in its 4-0 

victory over UCSD. 
Against USD, the Tritons used 

a seven-run explosion in the fourth 
inning to catapult themselves to 
the four-run win. 

The Tritons were aided by three 
USD pitchers who yielded five free 
passes to aid the Tritons in their 
outburst. Along with three singles, 
UCSD got a break on a controver-
sial catcher's interference call. 

UCSD Head Coach Lyle Yates 

managed to convince the home 
plate umpire that the UCSD catcher 
interfered with leftfielder Henry 
Jimenez's swing. 

The subsequent result was that 
UCSD forced home yet another 
run after two had already scored 
earliir that inning on walks with 
the bases loaded. 

Torero Head Coach John Cun-
ningham protested the reversal and 
was consequently thrown out of 

Rick Rupkey, 2-2 as a starter this season, pitched in relief against the University of San Diego. 

the game. 
Mike Morgan pitched six in-

nings and allowed only one run 
while strikina out seven and walk-
ing just one to earn his first win of 
the season. 

"Mike [Morgan) had complete 
control," Y aces said. "It was one of 
the best outings he's had in his last 
three years." 

The breaks went againsi UCSD 
(4-6Â»)n yesterday afternoon's Point 
Lorna contest when the Tritons 
were frustrated by an inability to 
drive in runs with men in scoring 
position. 

Four times, in the second, third, 
founh, and seventh innings, the 
Tritons hit the ball hard, but right 
at the defensive players. 

An important upcoming dou-
bleheader with Cal State San Ber-
nardino also affected the Tritons, 
as they were forced to alter their 
pitching rotation. 

Yates wanted to save his pitch-
ing staffforSaturday's games, thus 
explaining why starter J.J. Fisher 
threw three shutout innings, but 
was replaced by first-year player 
Ryan Flanagan. 

Flanagan threw two innings, 
giving up one run. 

The Crusaders put the game 
away in the eighth, when sopho-
more Rex Grayner took the mound 
for UCSD, which trailed 2-0 at the 
time. 

A two-run homer off Grayner 
sealed the loss for the Tritons.

game to win the match and

with 25 kills. Nate Brown added 
20 kills.

PHll...'S ANAL YSIS ... The 20-6 UCSD men's basket-
ball team has never played in the NCAA Division ill 
basketball tournament. Nebraska Wesleyan, UCSD's 
opponent in Saturday's 7:30 p.m. (CST) western region 
fIrst round game, has been there many times - in fact, in 
four out of the past six years, its team has made it to the 
Final Four. Nebraska Wesleyan (21-5) will also be the 
host. Is there a pattern developing here? Maybe. But 
something tells me the Tritons - who stonned through 
the Rochester Basketball Classic in December the last 
time they played out of state-will pull this one off. Even 
if Earl Edwards insists on making the trip, PHll.. says ...

Party 
Games 

Cardinal Puff: Boot Factor 3 
Cardinal Puff is one of the oldest and best drink-

ing games around. Unfortunately, we can't tell you 
the rules. 

You see, the game's rules and traditions are main-
tained by a sacred orderof members who call them-
selves "Cardinals." The only way to learn the game 
is to seek out a Cardinal-simply by asking everyone 
you meet "Are you a Cardinal?,'-and have him pass 
his knowledge on to you. 

If you succeed in learning the game, whichemails 
drinking every time you make a mistake while 
learning the ritual then you become a Cardinal and 
a keeper of the game. The members of this secret, 
loyal society travel by the creed, "Once a Cardinal, 
always a Cardinal."

Interview from the 
Dark Side 

Writers often find themselves 
stereotyped withina particular lit-
erary genre. Clive Barker, known 
for his past work in the macabre, 
has broken this mode with his re-
cent Harper and Row release, The 
Great and Secret Show. 

Barker's latest novel is a tale of 
the eternal struggle between gooJ 
and evil, within and around LIS. 
The first book of a planned rrilogy, 
it is a tale of the war between irra-
tionalityand science, and the magi-
cal marriage that can occur be-
tween them within the human 
heart . 

Barker's writing can only be 
called an exploration of the whole 
realm of the fantastic. Armed with 
a background in philosophy, and 
inspired by such writers as Poe, 
Bradbury, and the Brothers 
Grimm, he shocks us with power-
ful, even primal visionsofthe world 
behind our world. 

Barker made his name in the 
horrorrealm with Books o/BIood, a 
collection of extremely visceral and 
violent tales, with what he calls an 
"underpinning of ph ilosophy," 
and, he hopes, "poetry." 

Like Stephen King, Barker has 
enjoyed some success in the thea-
ters with his HeUraiser movies, 
while his most recent film 

TU Tl IR 

WITH VERY SPECIAL GUEST 

Nightbreed is currently playing . 

H IATUS: When did you first 
start writing, and what got you 
interested in it? 

CLIVE BARKER : Writing 
professionally started around seven 
years ago, when I first started pub-
lishing the Books of Blood, back 
when I was thirty. I wrote plays 
previous to that, which I have 
performed in London at the Edin-
borough Festival and across Eu-
rope. 

The interest in telling stories 
goes way back. It's a passion which 
has basically had many manifesta-
tions. I write movies, and make 
movies, and write books, and have 
done the theater stuff-the con-
stant thread is the storytelling 
element. 

H: What got you interested in 
the horror/fantasy genre? 

CB: The work "horror" really 
doesn't do it for me any longer 
because so much of what I've done 
recently, The Great and Secret Show 
and Wealleworld, have not particu-
larly been horror novels. But the 
fantastic, the imaginative sort of 
fiction, chose me rather than me 
choosing it. I never felt my imagi-
nation could go any Y'ay but that 
way. 

EXENE CERVENKA

I think actually what happens 
as a kid is that ir's sort of the 
natural way your instincts go. Kids 
for the most part do no play con-
ventional games, they do not play 
games of spiralling imagination. 
I'm still playing those games! 

H: With all the talented writ-
ers in your field, are there any that 
you particularly respect? 

CB: Oh god, yeah! There's a 
whole list of them in the areas in 
which I write, and in other areas 
too. Most of my, what we'll call, 
recreational reading is in actual 
fact work reading since I pend 
mostofmytimeresearchingwhat's 
coming up in the next book or the 
next movie. 

I still read Steve [King), Peter 
Straub, Thomas Hams, and Ram-
sey Campbell. You know, those 
names come up and up and up! I 
closely watch developments in sci-
encefiction-WilliamGibson,ob-
viously. But r also go back to the 
o ld forms. 

H: In a recent article in "Psy-
chology Today," there was a pas-
sage talking about what it saw as 
just the tremendous explosion of 
interest in horror, and fantasy in 
general, in recent years. What do 
you think is behind this phenome-
non? 

CB: I think the observation is 
fundamentally fake. I mean, there's 
always been the interest, there will 
always be the interest. Horror 
movies have been made in Holly-
wood from very early on, and even 
when they haven't been made (at 
least hugely expensive versions), 
there's always been the kind ofuB" 
movies which have dealt with these 

kinds of stories. 
I think in movies, clearly, the 

stalk and slash "tradition, "-1 hate 
to even use the word tradition but 
there it is --of the eighties, with 
the have-sex-and-<lie story, is on 
the wane. 

r hope we'll see a more inven-
tive and imaginative manifesta-
tion of this kind of fiction in the 
nineties .. 

H: Do you find that your own 
background in philosophy has 
made a difference in your writing! 

CB: Oh, absolutely! I think my 
passion is to entertain, but it 's also 
tostirupfeelingsand ideas! I would 

be disappointed if I got to the 
other end of my life and all I'd 
managed to do was to give some 
people some chills and some spills. 
I wantto give them that, of course . 

During the sexy parts I want to 
make sure they get aroused, and 
during the funny parts I want to 
see a mile twitch on their faces. 
When the book is put down or the 
movie's been seen, I want there to 
be somethmg else going on in their 
heads. 

H: Are there any particular 
messages that you want to teach 
your readers?

Aerosmith is Here to 

Pump You Up 
By Lara Heisler and Jennifer Yancey 

Editorial Assistants 

guitarist Joe Perry, guitarist Brad 
Whitford, drummer Joey Kramer, 
and bassist Tom Hamilton. 

Hamilton wryly added, "The 
part of the movie that really kills 
me is the Stonehenge thing. We 
used to always have problems with 
set5--the way we would envision 
them contrasted to the way they 
turned out. Somebody would 
smoke a joint at the wrong time 
and six feet would be mistaken for 
six inches." 

The band no longer has to worry 
about this kind of misunderstand-
ing, as all members are clean and 
sober. "Drugs were a big part of our 
live in the seventies," Hamilton 
explained. 

Collaborating with Run DMC 
in 1986, performmg recently on 
Saturday Night Live's "Wayne's 
World ," and appearmg hourly on 
MTV, shows that Aerosmith has 
achieved the status of a select few 
otherprestigiou old time rockand 
rollers. 

Tomorrow night, the quintet 
will be playing to a sold-outcrowd 
at the San Diego Sport Arena. In 
a recent telephone interview, Ha-
milton joked about real life as-
pects of Spinal Tap, and discussed 
the metamorphasis of a band that 
has been around the block more 
than once. 

"[They werel a big part of 
everybody's life , but they were also 
a big part of why we broke up in the 
late seventies. We finally realized 
that we all had to get clean. We 
had a lot of meetings, and we even-
tually all made the decsion to get 
off drugs." 

(I to r) Hamilton, Perry, Tyler, Kramer, and Whitford 

After twenty years, the 
Boston-based band not only main-
tains a high standard of quality, 
but also manages to keep in touch 
with and on top of new trends. 

Aerosmithcould easily be called 
the band that Spinal Tap aspired 
to be. They are a true embodiment 
of rock and roll. Their next album 
should be tided Permanently Hip. 

Aerosmith members include 
lead vocalist Steven Tyler, lead 

Cl 199OAT&T 

Confirm ing the va lidity of Spi-
nal Tap's parody of the rock music 
industry, Hamilton laughed, "Paul 
'Kick my ass' Shaeffer's character 
used to be a big part of our experi-
ence. But today, most people in 
the industry are really profes-
sional." 

"I was the last one to jump on 
the boat," Hamilton sheepishly 
admitted. 

Since they have eliminated 
drugs, the process of touring has 
become much easier. Hamilton 
pointed out, "To be truthful, re-
moving the hangover element

makes touring a blast." To enforce 
the drug free policy while touring 
with Guns N' Roses, a contract 
was drawn up to insure that Guns 
N'Roseskeptal1drugsandalcohol 
inside their dressing room, out of 
sight of any Aerosmith members. 

Another aspect that makes 
touring pleasant, Hamilton ex-
pla â¢â¢ 1ed, is that, "Now we know 
how to travel. We are able to take 
a private jet insteadofa bus. We're 
lucky to be able to do that, but

twenty years ..... 

Hamilton added, "We know 
how to communicate now. It used 
to be that when someone was pis-
sed off they wouldn't say anything, 
and then the band would divide up 
into factons." 

In addition to communicating 
with each other, Aerosmith also 
connects wel1 with their audience. 
Hamilton described the feeling of 
beingonstage: "Now that the band 
is playing so wel1, it's like we're 
playing different songs. Songs from 
ten and fifteen years ago sound 
much better than before. People 
love to hear both old and new 
songs." 

Hamilton confessed, "I know 
this is corny, but what really gets 
me off is to see people in the audi-
ence who are having so much fun 
that they are over the top. It's 
great when] see people who can't 
stop smiling." 

Their twelfth album, Pump, has 
enjoyed increasing airplay and 
recognition. In comparing it to 
their previous album, Permanent 
Vacation , Hamilton said, "Pump is 
better Aerosmith. I like Permanent 
Vacation, but on a few songs it was 
evident that the band was groping 
to redifine our style, and redis-
cover a way to fit together. We 
were going through our second 
round of growing pains." 

Furthermore, Hamilton added, 
"Pump is ballsier-bass and drums 
have to dominate." Hamilton 
ranks Pump as highly as 
Aerosmith's critically acclaimed 
classics Rocks and Toys in the Attic . 

Pump has been dubbed politi-
cally and SOCially loaded by critics 
and fans . Hamilton begs to differ: 
"We're not reaUy going for any 
'message' .. . I know Steve [Tyler] 
has talked about 'Janie's Got a 
Gun ... ' being political, but to be 
honest, he just had to think of 
some reason why Janie had a gun. 
He probably read something about 
[child abuse] in the paper that day, 
or it was something on his mind at 
that moment .. . Aerosmi th has not 
decided to get on the soapbox and 
preach." 

No matter how great their al-
bums are, Aerosmith's live per-
formance overshadows anything 
they record . The music and Tyler's 
on-stage antics are not the only 
parts of the experience. The fans 
are too. 

Hamilton said, "We want to 
appeal to everybody. We used to 
attract shirtless, sweaty males. Now 
we have a wel\~ressed crowd, with 
more girls up front ... 100s of girls 
decked out in their best clothes. 
But it's still a hard-core rock 
crowd." And Aerosmith is still a 
hard-core rock band.

UCSD Wakes Up to 'Morn' 

By Michael Schwartz 
Staff Writer 

One of the main functions of 
ttheater is to make us take a deeper 
look at who we are and destroy 
false beliefs that we hold. I t forces 
us to take a closer look at our 
values and thoughts as humans. 

"Inourtime, there isan intense 
reevaluation of what is valuable," 
UCSD graduate student Todd 
Salovey said. " Is a job meaningful? 
Is materialism meaningful? Is reli-
gion meaningful? I don't know 
what a meaningful life is, but I am 
passionately involved in the search 
to articulate one." 

Salovey's quest brings him to 
the Mandell Weiss Theatre this 
week with his direction of George 
Kaiser 's "From Mom to Midnight." 
The story is set in the security of 
Germany in 1912, and tells of a 
bank teller caught up in an era 
experiencing the first rush of 
mechanization and industrializa-
tion. 

This work is considered the 
finest example of the German 
Expressionist movement. "To me, 
expressionism is very appealing 
because it is not concerned with 
the photographic surface of the 
real world, but the mysteries that 
exist underneath it," Saloveysaid. 

Rather than utilizing the tradi-
tional structure of following a 

character through a defini te pe-
riod of time in their life, Kaiser's 
play is a station drama, structured 
Similarly toa medieval passion play. 
It follows one character through a 
series of places related only by 
theme and the presence of the 
central character. 

In the case of "From Mom to 
Midnight," the audience follows 
the central character, the cashier, 
through six locations as he inter-
acts with more than forty charac-
ters. 

Beginning in a provincial town, 
the play introduces the cashier's 
world, which is bounded by strict 
regulation. His life drastically 
changes when he experiences the 
touch of an exotic woman. What 
follows is a journey through a world 
not unlike the one experienced in 
today's materialistic society. 

Salovey states, "The cashier 
embezzles a large amount of money 
and goes in search of possibilities 
in his world in order to achieve 
something that is of value to him. 

"What's interesting about this 
play is that it presents a world 
revolving around 1912 in Ger-
many, yet parallels our world to-
day. Kaiser presents a world ob-
sessed with materialism, competi-
tion, sex, and salvation . These 

,Jefferson Mays and Joshua Sebers in the UCSD Theatre production-"From Morn to Midnight.' 

strike me as very current pursuits." 
The current production by the 

UCSD Theater Department is 
serving as Salovey's master thesis . 
"I chose this play because it spoke 
to me about a passionate attempt 
at braking out of all kinds of per-
sonal imprisonments and articu-
lates a quest that I identify With," 
Salovey says. 

Having had its last major pro-
duction in the 1920's, it might be 
seventy more years before the 
opportunity to see this classic 
comes again. 

The play continues tonight 
through Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
closes Sunday night at 7 p.m. at 
the Mandell Weiss Theatre. Tick-
ets are available at the Mandell 
Weiss Box Office 3-6 p.m. week-

days, the UCSD Box Office, and 
at all TicketMaster outlets. More

CB: There's an old line which 
sa s, "If I had wanted to send a 
message, I wou ld have gone West-
ern Union." 

But, no, I think you don't get to 
the end of The Great and Secret 
Show to find an easily compart-
mentalized or easily summarized 
message. For one thing, the book is 
five-hundred-and-slxty pages 
long, and if I'd been able to sum-
marize it in fifty, I would have 
written that down and left it at 
thar. 

Certainly I want the pages [0 
have a kind of richness of intellec-
tual life as well as an emotional 
life. I find the marriage of the 
entertaining, the bizarre , and the 
arresting, With an underpinning of 
philosophy-with thoughts about 
our place in the cosmos - an 
interesting combination. 

H: Why do you think people 
like being scared? 

CB: Well, it's safe for one 
thing, isn't it? It's a confrontation 
with a whole bunch of things, 
which if we saw them in the flesh, 
we'd probably not be very com-
fortable with. 

We have an animalistic desire 
[0 get the adrenalin going, and 
there is, I think, something very 
sexy about getting scared. There's 
something very rewarding about 
the sense that after we've been 
scared, "&y, it didn't happen after 
all!" We've survived, and came 
out unscathed. There's a whole 

gamut of reasons, but I think the 
idea of safe-fear is a major element. 

H: Is there anything that you 
can ay really scares you? 

CB: No, I think I'm pretty cool 
about the world. I don't like inac-
tivity, and I don't like banality, 
and I suppose at its most extreme 
that i scary. Somebody once said, 
"What is Hell?" a.,J I said "It's 
anything forever."

fantastic and the horrific and bring 
them down into the 
here-and-now, infUSing it into 
reality. What is it that you see as 
reality? 

CB: I think that's part of the life 
I live. We spend a third of our lives 

"There is, I think, something very sexy

appeared on my recent books. It's 
not on The Great and Secret Show, 
and it's not on the Nightbreed 
publicity. It's time to move on to 
ftesh areas. I'm not writing the 
kind of fiction anymore that Steve 
was talking about when he wrote 
that quote.

kinds of spiritual consequences 
when this life is over. I know I 
sound like Shirley MacClaine on 
ludes here, but I do have a sense 
that this is justthe beginning of an 
adventure, not the end, nowhere 
near the end! 

H: One theme which occurs 
regularly in your worlw. and again 
in The Great and Secret Show. is 
that the monster within us is often 
a lot more terrifying than any-
thing exterior to us, or supernatu-
ral. Is that a genera l observation 
about humanity? 

CB: Oh, absolutely! Over and 
over again, I'm talking about the 
ambiguities inside us, and our 
capacity to do terrible things a 
well as our great capacity to do 
good. 

The battle is going on daily, 
houriy, inside us. I find that in-
triguing. In Nightbreed [Cabaij,I've 
actually taken that one step fur-
ther and made the monsters the 
good guys. 

H: Another theme which seems 
tooccurregularly in your writing is 
that of the marriage between the 
horrific and the erotic. What do 
you see as the relationship between 
terror and sexuality? 

CB: The body. 
H: The body? 
CB: The body involves rrans-

formation. There is sexual trans-
formation, physical transforma-
tion, and corruption, daily. You're 
going to have to find a polite way 
of putting this for your readers, but 
you know you get a hard-on, and 
suddenly your body is telling you 
something you don't have control 

of. 
There are some circumstances 

when we hate to loose control-
when lYe throw-up, when we feel 
dizzy, when we get drunk, or al\ 
kinds of other bad feelings. When 
we get a virus, when we get a 
common cold, our body's out of 
control and we curse it! 

There's other circumstances, 
when loosing control is just the 
best thing in the world! 

H: So you think the relation-
ship between terror and sexuality 
is about passion and control? 

CB: You know there is a part of 
us which definitely wants control, 
and a part of us which wantS to 
throw ourselves over-that wants 
to get drunk, that wants to aban-
don ourselves to physical sensa-
tion. 

These two things, the Di-
onysian and the Apollonian-
that's the way the classicists would 
define those-the controller and 
the liberator, these two things are 
going on all the time in us. Con-
trary forces, contrary instincts. 

H : What do you see as the 
future of horror? 

CB: I don't make predictions 
like that. I know where l'Il be 
going. I'm going to be going into 
wilder and wilder territory, hoping 
my audience is going to follow me. 

There are so many routes, so 
many writers with so many dispa-
rate visions. I celebrate that dis-
parity! I celebrate the fact that 
these individuals have got their 
own dreams.

Gun 
Taking on the World 
A&MRecords 

Mainstream hard rock has hit 
an all-time low point of medioc-
rity. So many groups basically 
sound and look the same. Gun fits 
that description, and their debut 
albumonA&M records, Takingon 
the World displays this lackoforigi-
nality that currently plagues radio. 

This Glasgow band touts them-
selves as the new Metallica in their 
press release, bu t they are far from 
reaching that goal. Instead of play-
ing real heavy metal, they opt to 
follow the lead of such trendy 
rockers as &n Jovi. But again 
they fall short of the masters of th is 
genre. 

There is a lotof potential talent 
in Gun, which formed in 1987. 
Their influences are quite varied 
(from AC/OC to INXS) but they 
fail to combine their mentors' styles 
into original, interesting music. 
Guitarists Guiliano Gizzi"and Baby 
Stafford have the ability to play 
interesting rhythm and solo gui-
tars, but instead they play generic 
riffs and solos straight from their 
guitar lessons. 

Only two songs off the album 
can be considered as passable rock 

songs. "Better Days" shines above 
the other cuts through Dante 
Gizzi's intricate bass lines, and 
vocalist Mark Rankin preaching 
about their hopes for the future. 

"Taking on the World," the 
band 's best effort, combines the 
use of acoustic guitar with excel-
lent lyrics to convey the problems 
and hopes of a couple. "You're 
holding out your hand/ Are you 
falling! You 're talking to yourself/ 
Nobody's there." 

Actually, Gun is a good band 
that fails to make use of their po-
tential to create hard, intense 
music like Soundgarden or AC/ 
OC. Hard rock should be dirty, 
powerful, and defiant, but Gun 
doesn't display any of these traits. 
Instead, the band sounds like the 
typical Top-40 radio band that 
will have one hit song and then 
never be heard from again. 

Chunky A 

By Joshua Odinu 
Staff Writer 

Large and in Charge 
MCARecords 

For those of you who don't 
know, Chunky A is actuafly 
Arsenio Hall in his "fat suit." Un-
fortunately, that's about the most 

interesting comment that can be 
made about his new album, Large 
and in Charge. Let's just say it's a 
good thing he makes a better 
talkshow host than a rapper. 

The title track and "I Com-
mand You To Dance," are dumb 
and falsely arrogant. "Stank 
Breath" is the only song besides 
"Sorry" that is even remotely hu-
morous. 

The very last song on the al-
bum is what saves the whole effort. 
The song is called "Dope, The Big 
Lie," and itdelivers a message with 
convincing style . It starts OUt 
portrayingdruggies, then proceeds 
to put down drugs with every pos-
sible method. 

One of the most impressive 
verses is: "A high is temporary/ 
Can leave you in the mortuary/If 
Belushi, Bias and Joplin couldn't 
hang/\Xlhat makes you think/You 
can beat this thing." 

Endorsement is probably the 
most effective methos used on this 
cut. There are cutaways to various 
artists, similar to the way the Band 
Aid movement did several years 
ago. Some of the endorsees in-
clude Ice-T, Paula Abdul, Wil 
Wheaton, and Arsenio Hall. Not 
only are the words effective, but 
the music actually keeps the lis-
teners attention on this song, 
which is unique for the album. 

Disregarding "Dope, The Big 
Lie," Large and in Charge is simply 
a weak effort. It fails even as a 
parody on rap as an art form If Hall 
had re leased this cut only as a 
single, he probably would have gOt 
some deserved air time, sold a lot 
of si ngles and saved himself a lot of 
embarrassment. At best, the al-
bum has good intentions. Nice 
try, Arsenio!

Psychefunkapus 
Psyche{unkapus 
Atlantic Records 

Their name is P ychefunkapus. 
They are from the San Francisco 
Bay Area. They are five in number 
and they can funk. That is all you 
need to know-go buy it. If you 
want elaboration read on. 

There is orne good singing on 
this work, which i the band's self-
titled debut. The vocali t , Gene 
Genie and Manny Martinex, 
stretch from rappy chanting 
("A.M.") to ka/irie vocalizing 
("Slut Child") to punk yodels 
("Je u Crispies"). And yes, the 
lyrics are often intelligent and 
divergent of the "ooh, baby, baby" 
syndrome that so often plagues 
music listener . 

The music i definitely the 
album's highlight, with whipping, 
freaky bass-lines and wah-wah 
guitars coming from Atom Ben-
jamin Ellis and Jonny Axtell. Yet, 
as you've probably already guessed, 
Psychefunkapus i not just a hom-
age to George Clinton. It is also a 
tip of the hat to classic Black Sab-

bath and artsy-rock dinosaurs like 
Yes. 

One of the best things about 
Psychefunkapus is that you can get 
a good, spicy taste of distorted 
metal/hard-rock, without the silly 
demon/mass-murderer album cov-
ers, and without looking at those 
tupid pandex pants with the 

cut-out butts. 
As you can see, there is actually 

more to P ychefunkapus than just 
funkin' out. They have soul and 
they've got peed. They ar only 
two years old, but they can do the 
walk. Give it a go.

Wendy MaHarry 
Wendy MaHarry 
A&M Records 

Wendy MaHarry is a different 
type of musician. 

Trained at college in art and 
music, MaHarry strayed into the 
highly ~ssimistic art/mUSic scene 
of the early '80s, only to find it was 
just a bit too melancholy and self-
destructive. 

However, by the late '80s she 
was able to tum her life around and 
create some very moving music on 
her piano. 

With her elf-titled debut al-

bum, MaHarry explodes into the 
music industry with an album based 
on her past experiences with art. 

Of the fourteen songs on the 
album, only "Happy Holidays," a 
ong with a slow, melodic begin-

ning that picks up in tempo, stand 
out.This is probably the best song 
on the album. 

With the aid of producer 
Dwight Marcus, MaHarry is able 
to present the public with not only 
a fre h outlook on life, but also one 
that is more optimistic than is 
portrayed by a lot of musicians. 

Some of the album's song titles 
are rather ominous, suggesting that 
MaHarry is still influenced by the 
post-punk, depression-filled art/ 
music scene of the early '80s. 

Yet this is a false suggestion, 
because after listening to Wendy 
MaHany, it becomes clear that 
she now holds a much more confi-
dent view that life is really not all 
that bad. 

Oha Haza 
Desert Wind 
Sire Records 

By James Darlow 
Guardian Reporter 

Ofra Haza's second Sire release, 
Desert Wind, shows a continuity in 
the lush and exotic style that char-
acterized her 1987 American 

debut, Shaday, but with some 
important new departures. Some 
of the innovations in Haza's new 
album can be attributed to the 
change in her producers: she is 
now under the guidance of Tho-
mas Dolby. 

Haza's Yemenite-Jewish roots 
are the focus of many of the songs 
though lyrics in both English and 
Hebrew which discuss a variety of 
social, political, and religious ques-
tions. 

Lyrically, Desert Wind is uni-
fied both in sound and structure. It 
melts together in a subtle Middle-
Eastern style that would be hard to 
recapture solely through singles. 
"Middle East" has a political tonej 
the liner notes poignantly recall 
that, "We could tum the Middle 
East into Heaven, for we all are the 
key." 

"Slave Dream" is a daring de-
parture in sound and style from 
Haza's previous manner. After 
visiting a former slave seaport in 
Brazil, she imagined hearing the 
" creaming voices of people turned 
slaves by other people." The whin-
ing wail of this song creates an 
eerie feeling which is strength-
ened by a pulsating drum beat in 
the background. The song resolves 
nothing and leaves you feeling 
almost uneasy, with the injustice 
that has been perpetrated. 

Desert sands and ceaseless 
wandering are conjured up by 
"DA'ASA," a beautifully evoca-
tive song which has been adapted 
from an ancient Yemenite mel-
ody. The album ends on a religious 
note: "Kaddish" is the name of the 
last song and the ancient Jewish 

A.S. 

prayer of mourning.

The Grapes of Wrath 
Now and Again 
Capitol Records 

If you are looking for a new 
small band to listen to, The Grapes 
of Wrath may be the band for you. 

A Canadian group, although 
not as refined as more established 
bands, comes across as a mix be-
tween the Three O'Clock and The 
Mighty Lemon Drops. 

A reviewer of the band once 
said they were "trying to do an '80s 
version of Fleetwood Mac." This 
is a good description of the band, 
since they claim that Fleetwood 
Mac and The Eagles have influ-
enced their music. 

Their music comes across as an 
interesting blend of country and 
rock. This album is diverse, rang-
ing from upbeat, fast song to 
slower, more reflective ones. 

In terms of lyrics, this band 
offers more than the usual subject 
oflove. The lyrics move from their 
personal struggles to more univer-
al issues. Although not advisable 

for dancing, it is excellent for lis-
tening.
