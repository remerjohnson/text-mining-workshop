Brown, Curb·Split Ticket; 5, 6 -lose 
Deukmajian Attorney General; 7 Passes; Bird Confirmed 

By Eric Jaye 
Managing Editor 

California voters, showing 
nothing that resembles a 
political trend, returned their 
off-beat Governor to the state-
hou&e yesterday, while rejec-
ting the anti-gay teacher's 
initiative and electing Repub-
licans to two top state posts. 

Incumbent Democratic Gov-
ernor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. 
took a lopside'd win over 
Republican Attorney General 
Evelle Younger, leading by a 
56%-37% margin with 44% of 
the state vote tallied. 

State voters demonstrated 
their traditional political 
independence in other election 
battles, as liberal State Sup-
reme Court Chief Justice Rose 
Bird was apparently retained 
in her post, while at the same 
time Proposition 7, which 
would significantly strengthen 
the death penalty, was approv-
ed by a three to one margin. 

Republican millionaire rec-
ord producer Mike Curb ousted 
Democratic Incumbent Lt. 
Governor Mervyn Dymally, 
leading with more than UCYt..of 
the vote at midnight this 
morning. 

In the Attorney General's 
race, RepubUcan George Deuk-
majian, who had taken a strong 
law and order stance in his 
campaign, overtook Yvonne 
Braithwaite Burke, winning by 
a 54%-43% margin. 

Two of the more controver-
sial ballot propositions, 5 and 
six, both went down to defeat 
last night. 

Proposition 5, the Clean 
Indoor Air Act, was rejected by 
54% of the voters, the tally 
early this morning showed. 

The same returns indicated 
that Proposition 6, the bitterly 
contested anti-gay teachers 
initiative, was being defeated 
by a 57%-43% margin. 

According to Associated 
Press reports, people across 
the state who fought ag.ainst 
Proposition 6 rejoiced at thier 
victory. . 

Evelle Younger 
But State Senator John 

Briggs, the driving force 
behind 6, vowed last night he 
had only begun to combatwhat 
he termed the homosexual 
threat, the Associated Press 
said .. 

In other major statewide 
races, former Assembly Speak-
er Jesse Unruh was re-elected 
State Treasurer, Incumbent 
March Fong Eu retained her 
Secretary of State post and Ken 
Cory will return Q Controller. 
All three are Democrats. 

.. V ..... " 
In acknowledging his victory 

last night, Brown told a crowd 
of supporters at the Bonaven-
ture Hotel in Los Angeles that 
he had a "vision" for Califor-
nians. 

As he did often during the 
election campaign, Brown last 
night said the state, which he 
referred to as the "mosaic of 
California," could advance and 
grow, while at the same time 
responding to the "spirit of 
frugality." • 

Brown thanked all of his re-
election supporters and said, 
"Every election victory is an 
opportunity but also a great 
challange. "

Back Page 

Brown asked Californians to 
help him realize his goals for 
the state, which he listed as 
including a growth in tech-
nology and paying greater 
attention to ecological con-
cerns. 

Referring to his " vision" for 
Californians, Brown said, 
"Help me make it a reality." 

"Great Honor" 
By defeating Mervyn Dy-

mally, Curb, 33, becomes the 
first Lt. Governor since 1894 to 
belong to a different party than 
the Governor. After it became 
clear he would defeat DyamlIy, 
the state's first black Lt. Gov-
ernor, Curb told his supporters 
in Los Angeles, "This is the 
greatest honor you could 
possibly give me," the Assoc-
iated Press reported. 

Other Races 
In other statewide ballot 

measures, the tallies at mid-
night showed: 
-Proposition I, the Veteran 's 
Bond, was winning with 63% of 
the vote. 

- Proposition 2 , a public 
utilities control measure , 
appeared to be winning. 
- Proposition 3, a coastal land 
initiative, was winning with 
54% of the vote. 

- Proposition 4, which would 
legislate controls on chiro-
practors, was winning with 
more than 74% of the voters 
approving of the measure. 

Governor Jerry Brown overwhelmingly re-elected. 

DCIB liearings Continue 
Genter Praised, Expansion Urged 

By Reed A1pen 
Edtaor 

The Day Care Information 
Board yesterday heard testi-
mony from students, faculty 
and staff on the quality of the 
UCSD Day Care Center and the 
need for expansion of the 
Center. 

Jane Watkins, a gradua~e 
student, spoke first and praised 
the high quaUty of the Center, 
noting that "the educational 
program at a pre-school level 
was conducted in a positive 
atmosphere." She also said the 
Center's director, Josie Foulks, 
was "incredibly devoted to the 
kids." 

Kathleen Murphy Mallinger, 
a staff employee who was 
involved in the beginnings of 
the Center in 1971, discussed the 
move in the Spring of 1976, in 
which the Center went from 

under the auspicies of Student 
Affairs to the Business Office. 

Mallinger said that in con-
junction with the move was an 
explicit assurance from Chan-
cellor Willian McElroy that the 
Center would be renovated and 
an jinplicit assurance that the 
Center would be expanded. 

Mallinger cited a letter from 
McElroy to Foulks dated May 
21, 1976 that stated, " ... 1 expect 
to be presented with various 
alternatives that will lead to the 
estabUshment of a functional 
Center facility with a capacity 
of some 60-70 children and in 
compliance with all state 
standards for funding and 
Iiscensure in the very near 
future." 

The Day Care Information 
Board, which is charged with 
administering a referendum on 
Day Care to be presented to the 

students this winter quarter, 
was told by Jeff Elman, a 
Linguistics professor, that the 
referendum should call for 
expansion of the Center to 
accommodate the demand for 
child care. He also said it 
"seems clear there is a definite 
potential" for the University to 
seek funds for the Center in the 
community and added he had 
spoken with a La JoUa busi-
nessman who would be willing 
to work as a fundraiser for the 
Center. 

Josie Foulks, the Center's 
director, recounted the history 
of the Center from its be-
ginnings as a parent co-op on 
the lawn in front of the Humani-
ties Library to "what we are 
now - a high quality day care 
center."

However, JU8t in case anyone

tbin,l . Tbe first II about

inatioa; wblch I take to involve 
reaervinl quotas for, or givinJ 
special preferential weilbtln, 
to , members of particular 
racial ,rouPI'. Racism I c0n-
strue as the advanta,iag or 
diaadvantaliDl people on the 
balis of tile particular racial 
groups to wblcb they bappen to 
belong. In these understand-
ings of tbe terms, poUcies of 
positive (or reverse) discrim-

racist. it may be that there Is

Is that IIICb poDciea would or do

For the IncIividuall who may 
benefit or suffer are not beiq 
picked out sa themaelvea the 
suffererl or doers of any 
InJuIUce, but only 81 con-
temporary members of tbe 
same racial groups as tboIe 
sufferers or doers. 

Second, durin, tile aforemen-
tioned period In Malawi I wal 
able to see quite a lot of schoo". 
Moat of the boys and gir" in 
those ICbools came from homes 
wbicti were, in many terms, 
worse off than households in 
tbla country belDi on welfare; 
and the bulldinJs and equl~ 
ment were usually thou,b DOt 
alwaYI by US and even UK 
standards poor. But the boys 
and lirll, thoUlh not lackiDi 
their ordinarily buman Ibare of 
lively mlscbievou.ness, ob-
viously wanted · to leam; and 
their parents were usually ~ven 
more keen that they sbould. I 
confess tbat I could not belp 
then makin, lOme compari-
sons with some center city 

schoo" wblcb I bad seen earlier 
In the USA; and I have since 
more than once been told by 
teacbers In such aeboo.. that 
they actuaDy Dve In fear of 
their classes. 

Faced with lucb contrasts I 
would have to be as deficient in 
,oodwill as my unknown

Day Care is-Our Responsibility 
By ADdy Scbeider 

Day care is a social respo~ 
sibility. Commitments are 
never cheap. The real buman 
need wue becomes clouded In 
all tbe bauling over bow much 
the service should cost and at 
what quality level. 

Let's look at the bottom line. 
Are we ,oing to take respon-
sibility for eacb otber a8 
members of a common student 
community? If your aos.wer is 
no, say so, don' t confuse your 
position with complaints about 
cost. If your aoswer is yes, put 
your money wbere your mouth 
is and cou,h up tbe bucks. 

Day care provides access to 
tbis University. There are some 
students who couldn' t be bere 
without such a service for their 
children. Some would say tbat 

society abould have no respon-
sibility for the clrlld who il the 
product of a parent's decllion. I 
would argue that our relpon-
sibiUty Is to open our doors to 
students witb every back-
,round. A siDgie black mother 
bas jUlt 81 much rigbt to 
participate in the benefits of 
this institution al Johnny wbo 
comes straight from college 
prep with an education paid for 
by parents. 

To fall in providing day care 
services would be an expres-
sion of our failure to take 
responsibility for opening up 
UCSD to all people . Some 
itudents have needs wbicb are 
more costly than otbers. Just 
because we can provide Inter-
collegiate Athletics or Coun-
seling at a lower cost per user

Response to Flew 
Termed 'Uneducated' 
Editor: 

It is difficult to believe that 
Losaka I,binigie is a student at 
the University of California. 
His letter published in your 
paper on November 1 berates 
Profe880r Flew in the laDlUa,e 
and temper of an uneducated, 
cbauvinistic bi,ot. 

Lasoka seems bardly to meet 
the professor on the merits of 
his (Mr. Flew's) remarks -
good , bad or indifferent . 
Losaka only objects to the 
professor's rigbt to speak up at 

all: because be bas been here 
only tbree months; because 
only Americans dare challenge 
tbe subject; because he tam· 
pers with a "domestic issue" ; 
because at Oxford one doesn't 
behave in this fasbion. 

It appears tbat Losata would 
bave us listen only to the beat 01 
his own drums; I must add, 
without an ear for the music of 
free speech. 

Perhaps be is only very 
young.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - The 
California Supreme Court has 
decided a controversial case 
but has delayed the announce-
ment of tbe decision, the Los 
Angeles Times reported yester-
day. 

According to the Times, tbe 
court voted 4-3, with Cbief 
Justice Rose Bird among the 
majority, to overturn a 1975 law 
requiring a prison tenn for 
anyone convicted of using a ,un 
during a violent crime. 

NEW YORK (AP) - Tbe 
stock martet tumbled yester-
day amid concerns over bi,b 
interest ratel, the dollar and 
tbe pouibllity of an economic 
slowdown in 1979. 

At 3 pm, decDnes outnum-
bered advancel by nearly 10-1 
amon, New York Stock Ex-
change-listed issues and the 
Dow Jonel avera,e of 30 
industrials was down 16: 28 to 
798.60. NYSE volume came to a 
moderate 21.56 million sbares 
in the first five bours of trading. 

The dollar fell ~galnst most 
major foreip currencies today 
as traders awaited the next

Jail for 
Hearst 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A 
federal judge refused yester-
day to set aside Patricia 
Hearst's bank robbery convic-
tion or modify her seven-year 
sentence. 

She had alleged her trial was 
" reduced to a mockery, a farce 
and a sham hecause of ineffec-
tive assistance of counsel. " 

In denying all Miss Hearst's . 
motions, U.S. District Court 
Judge William Orrick Jr. 
declared that "none of the 
evidence offered in her bebalf, 
even i r clearly established at an 
evidentiary hearin" would 
entitle her to relief." 

As to her allegations of 
inadequate representation by 
fa med trial lawyer F . Lee 
Bailey, Judge Orrick said: 

.. The exhausti ve efforts 
expended on her behalf in the 
course of proceedings served to 
ex pose petitioner ' s specific 
compla ints as speculative , 
unfounded assertions com-
pletely unwar:an(ed by the 
record." 

Chevettes 
Recalled 

DETROIT (~) - General 
Motors announced yesterday 
the recall of 320,000 19'76 and 
1977 Chevettea for "fuel tank 
modifications" and 130,000 19'75 
subcompact models for part 
changes in front wheel bear-
ings. 

G M officials said tbe recalls 
were voluntary and not under 
government order, althou,h 
the Chevette fuel system has 
r ecently come under the 
scrutiny of at least one govern-
ment agency. 

The Cbevette recall involves 
about 117,000 1976 models and 
133,000 1977 models which GM 
officials said need plastic 
shields around the fuel tanks 
a.nd other work on rear suspen-
Sion parts. 

struction will rise just 2 percent 
- and housln, construction will 
drop substantially - io 1979. 
Total construction outlays in 
19'78 are running 15 percent 
ahead of last year's levels, tbe 
department said. 

Risin, interest rates are a 
major factor bebind the ex-
pected construction fall off. The 
hi,ber interest rates are part of 
Federal Reserve and adminis-
tration plaDS for coolin, the 
economy, curbin, inDation and 
strengtbening tbe dollar . . As 
one indicator of the effects of 
that stratelY, a lh-point in-
crease in the prime lending rate 
to HPJ. percent spread to most 
major banks thjs week. 

The NYSE's composite index 
dropped .89 to 52 . 14 ; the 
American Stock Exchange 
market value index fell 3.12 to 
141.36. 

But accordin, to tbe story, 
Associate Justice Mathew O. 
Tobriner, a supporter of Ms. 
Bird , was withholding tbe 
decision in the case of People 
vs. Tanner. Ms . Bird' s con-
firmation was one of several 
that faced voters yesterday. 

A decision overturnin, the 
law is certain to anger law 
enforcement officials in {he 
state. Tbe law is the basis for 
tbe billboards with the slogan 
··Use a gun, go to prison." 

In a sta tement released 
yesterday afternoon in San 
Francisco, the chief justice 
angrily denied tbe Times report 
and questioned the timing of 
the article.

Gandbi , swept from power 
twenty months a,o by voter 
reaction to her emer,ency rule, 
has recaptured a seat in 
Parliament. . 

Returns showed early today . 
that she had defeated her main 
opponent, Veerendra Patil of 
the ruling Janata Party, in 
Chikmagalur, a district in 
southern India finnly control-
led by her supporters . 

With nearly 90 percent of the 
ballots from Sunday ' s by-
election counted, Gandhi, 60, 
had 216,947 votes to 148,829 ror 
Patil, the United News of India 
reported from Chikmagalur, 
1,100 miles south of here. 

The by-election, called alter 
a member of her " Indira 
Congress" . Party resigned in 
June, was the first political 
contest Gandhi had entered 
since her stunning dereat in the 
March 1977 general election.

cases before this court where 
release has been delayed for 
political reasons or for any 
otber reasons extraneous to the 
decision-making process," Ms. 
Bird said. 

" It is a curious coincidence 
that this story appears on the 
morning of tbe day when the 
voters are going to the polls." 

According to the Times story , 
Tobriner, when asked if be was 
delaying the decision, replied, 
"I'm utterly sealed. My oath is 
not to disclose anythin, that 
goes on in tbis court. I can say 
nothin" absolutely zero, zero, 
zero." 

However, two, otber justices 
reportedly confirmed tbat 
individual decisions bad been 
signed by all members of tbe 
court. 

In her statement, Ms . Bird 
said, " I will not permit Justice 
Tobriner' s inte,rity to be 
maligned by those who seek 
momentary political advan-
tage in their a ttacks against 
me," 

The story echoes allegations 
made last month by Evelle 
Younger that the court was 
s itting on controvers ial de-
cisions until after the general 

election. 
Youn,er -told a news confer-

ence yesterday that it was 
" very unfortunate the con-
firmation would c ome on 
election day" and added, " I 
hope they (the Times) baven't 
been sitting on the story. 

" I have no reason to think it 
did, but I certainly think it's 
stranie that tbe confinnation 
of wbat I said a month ago 
comes on election day." 

The law in question was 
frequentl y cited by Go v. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. as one of 
his administration 's law en-
forcement accomplishments. 
Brown declined comment. 

The Supreme Court ruling 
upholds a San Mateo County 
Superior Court j udge wh o 
placed convicted robber Harold 
E . Tanner on probation after 
ruling that the 1975 law uncon-
stitutionally limited j udicial 
discretion. 

An appeals court overruled 
the San Mateo decision in May 
1977 . The Supreme Court 
granted a hearing im mediately 
a fte rward a nd hea rd a rgu-
ments last February.

the athletes while they are

that thia emerpncyexpeMe be 
included In the price of the 
intercolleJiate athletics pr~ 
",lim when it ls bl'OUlbt before 
the Rei Fee Committee for 
approval. 

Armitale explained thal 
scbools which· charle admis-
lion to athletic events ' Ullually 
use that revenue to pay for the 
teams' Insurance. "But we 
don't bave revenue, wbich 
me8DI the rei fee is the only 
place from wblcb it can corne, .. 
beuld. 

He did recopize the p0s-
sibility of baviq each athlete 
pay for bls or her own l!asur-
ance. However, berejectedtbls 
altem8tlve aa heIDI "m ... y." 
He aaid, "We thiDk, further-
more, tbIIt it miCbt leave lOme 
people who 0UIbt to, and would 
want to partielpate, out, andwe 
want to pt as many partici-
patlq and • larle squads as 
we can pt." 

RqardiDi the overall added 
expeue of the separate cover-
ale, be said, "We bave ade-
quate reterve8 in our balance 
rlIbt now to baodlethat. But, it 
~ will be a contributiq factor to 

the increase in costs, there's no 
question." 

Of the ",000 appropriated for 
the purpose of insuring inter-
collegiate athletes, $3,900 is for 
the coverage of the men's and 
women's. rugby ~ams, alone. 

•. .: '_~~h "wo'lJd ,lffl,d, OAe to 
wonder," said Armitage , 
"whether it was really fair to 
ask all' the students on the 
campus to pay for the rugby 
insurance. I feel the students 
should decide that, not me ," 

He further speculated that it 
was because of such high 
premiums that insurance of 
intercollegiate athletics could 
not have been included in the 
student health insurance for the 
amount of money delegated by 
the Reg Fee Committee. 

The Vice-Chancellor would 
like to see the negotiating 
process changed in the future . 
Rather than trying to tailor an 
insurance policy to fit lhe funds 
allotted, he said, " This year, I 
told the Reg Fee Committee 
last Wednesday, I want Dr. 
Allen to make a presentation of 
alternative coverages. When 
they decide what coverage they 
want, then he goes for bids and 
comes back with the price tag." 

Day Care

ployee, argued that in lipt of 
the decision by the Adminis-
tration this summer that only 
tbe children of students could 
attend t~ Center, the CeDter 
Ihould be made available to 
students, faculty and Itaff 
because It would provide a 
stability to the Center, hllure a 
broad-based support IrouP for 
the Center on campus and 
would provide for a divenity of 
children In the center. 

Linda Sabo, who served as 
the UC statewide day care 
Intern, laid there appeanlo be 
developinl a statewide com-
mitment to day care and that 
there is a possibility tbat the 
State Department of Education 
could fund the UCSD Center up 
to 100% in the nexl two years. 
For 1978-79, SDE funds are 
providing approximately 50'1,

Triton Spikers Smash Southwestern 
By Henry DeVries 
and Sberi Tbomas 

The woman's volleyball team 
rallied to a shattering victory 
Monday night a,ainst a power-
less Southwestern College 
team. The Tritons managed to 
capture tbeir opponents in only 
four decidina ,8me111-1f, 5-15. 
15-8, and II-If. The glrla played 
an imprellive defensive game. 
however It was their offensive 
strategy that led to the victory. 

"Everybody did such a good 
job." exclaimed team member 
Nancy Wada. "we were playing 
new positions and it enhanced 
our playing ability:' The girls 
were placed differently for the 
game because of the absence of 

injured Cely Bergado. Filling in 
(or her was leading spiker. Betb 
Prather. Prather played a 
convincing match. using spikes 
and smart net-play to gain 
several mandatory points. 

"Beth played very well as 
middle blocker," said Coach 
Grace Greenburg, "The posi-
tion was new to her and she did 
fine ." 

Sherri Lilley also scored in 
some difficul playing situa. 
tions against her opponents. 
"Lilley was effective in ber 
oCCense," added Greenburg. 
"Our momentum really pulled 
us through." 

Up until Monday night's 
game things had not been going 

very well for the UCSD 
women's volleyball team. First 
the team's coach. Grace 
Greenberg, was temporarily 
sidelined after an automobile 
accident. Secondly. the team 
lost two straightaway matches 
over the weekend to Mesa 
College and Biola College. 

Irreenberg was hospitalized 
from Tuesday afternoon to 
early Sunday morning. The 
coach suffered a broken bone in 
her lower pelvic area. For the 
time being she is forced to walk 
on crutches . "I'm a little 
bruised, but my spirits are 
higb," said -Greenberg . "I 
received a lot of moral support 
from UC people."

Cross Line 
Second 

The UCSD men 's cross 
country team 's second place 
finish in the Southern Cali-
fornia Collegiate Track and 
Field Championships, held in 
Riverside last Saturday. will 
give them the momentum they 
need to place high in the 
upcoming District III Cham-
pionships. 

Running ' without Doug Ja-
cobson. the team's consistent 
top runner, the Tritons faced 
ninety degree heat and smog 
but managed to place their top 
four finishers among the first 
ten runners. Jacobson elected 
not to run on Saturday due to his 
disliking of the fi ve mile 
Riverside course and ·the 
unusual weather conditions. 

Pete Dolan lead the way for 
the Tritons with a 27 : 11. 
followed by Pat Morton (27: 52), 
John Halperin (27: 59) and Tim 
Helms (28: 09) . Jeff Steinhart 
rounded out the top five with his 
28: 25 five mile time. 

The second place finish 
marks the highest place that 
the Tritons have ever finished 
in a conference championship. 
In less than three seasons the 
team has improved from firtb 
place to second against ~ 
same competition. 

" We were very pleased with 
Our finish on Saturday," 
commented Coach Andy Skief. 
" The course was mostly pave-
ment and with the heat I was 
ju.st hoping for a good showing 
With no injuries. With this effort 
Our runners will be psyched up 
Cor Saturday's race. "

the first two games 15-8 and 15-
9, Mesa came back to win the 
second two matches 15-5 and 15-
7. Mesa then took the rubber 
game of the match 15-9. 

On Saturday the squad 
traveled to LA to face Biola . 
" We got off to a slow start. " (elt 
Jacobs. " We came back really 
strong. but it was too late. " 
Biola swept the Tritons in 3 
straight by scores of 15-6, 15-12, 
and 15-13. 

Cheryl Wright. a team c()o 
. captain. felt that it was hard to 

exactly say "what went 
wrong." She admitted that the 
temporary loss of Greenburg 
had to have an effect. but that 
" Eric and Hal have done a good job." 

Irreenberg stated that she 

was very indebted to Zarakov. 
Jacobs, and volunteer assistant 
Albert "Buzz" Arce. She was 
very proud of what she termed 
" the UCSD maturity" shown by 
her assistant coaches and 
players. "From whatI hear the 
women played with indepen-
dence and handled the situation 
well. " 

The team will face nationally 
ranked SDSU tonight at 7: 30 at 
State. Greenberg guarantees 
that it will be "good exposure" 
for the squad and " definitely 
quite an experience_"

The Densa Saga 
By JoeepIa RelDer 

Beckoning each' week from 
the classified pa.es of tbe 
Reader fa a beacon to the bright 
and lonely people of San Die,o 
- the vaguely mournful cry of 
Mensa. I have ulually dis-
missed their question "00 you 
know your I.Q.1" as simply 
belD, a come-on to a sort of 
computer dating service with-
out tbe dating - you know 
people aittlD, around with their 
calculators h~ loosely at

to surreptitiously mention their 
entrance teat scores to wbom-

Two weeb 810, bowever. a 
more intereatiq ad appeared 
in the paper - a group called 
Denaa wu urliDl people tojoin 
up. Feellq that tbe club might 
provide an IDtereatlq story, or 
at least be ODe I could let ioto, I 
pve the number a call. 

A man annered the pIJOne 
and IDtroduclD, bim.elf as 
EddIe LeBIane, premclentoltbe 
local Oenaa cbapter, a.ked 
what be eouId do for me. I 
explained my IDterest in his 
or,anlzation and uked if J 
could meet with him sometime. 
After aasuring him that I was 
not someone Damed Freddie, 
whom he apparently believed 
might be playing a joke on him. 
J:Ie a,reed to meet me that 

afternoon and ,ave me direc-

The directions he gave were 
88 twisted as the trail of a rat 
with brain cancer. Luckily I 
knew the area and was able to

addreu be ,ave me. It turned 
out to be that of an abandoned 
bowlin, alley ID aoutheut San

Above tbe door I had just 
entered bUIll a neon sieD which 
blinked impressively with tbe

two suddenly noticed me and 
motioned me into a chair. He 
then chuckled and said "this is 
Vice-President Billy 'Leuo Of 
My Ear Ma' Averra,io," 
pointinl to the other man who 
wall starinl bla~y at me and 
droolinl slilhtly onto his 
Farrah Fawcett athletic T-
shirt, "and I'm Eddie 'Please 
Let Go Of My Ear Mother' 
LeBlanc - you the illY I talked 
to, rteht?" I admitted I wasand 
he immediately launched into 
an enthusiastic description of 
the club's history, rerniDdin, 
me, with his thrustln, gestures 
and leering grins, of an obese 
janitor I .knew in Junior hil!t . 

Eddie then noticed my watch 
and uked me to tell him what 
time it was. It turned out that he 
was late for his job as second 
shift potato chip inspector and 
dashing out of the office, left me 
in the able though clammy 
hands of Billy. I wanted to leave 
too but was afraid of hurting 
Billy's feelinls, He had been 
staring the whole time at Eddie 
with obvious resentment, and 
was now picking a scab on his 
knee in a definitely menacing 
manner. So I asked him if he 
would tell me anything about 
the club's philosophy in ex-
change for a cheese sandwich. 
It's an old chestnut of a question 
but it caused his face to soften 
like recycled hamburger fat at 
room temperature - or maybe 
it was just the promise of food; 
at any rate I felt safer. Between 
mouthfuls he answered me, 

"We're just a bunch a guys who 
are too dumb to get laid 
individually, but we believe 
that the sum total of us working 
together might be able to 
attract some female in here." 
At this point he burst into fits of 
grunting laughter and I , 
pausing only to remove some 
expelled particles of cheese 
sandwich from my shirt , 
quietly left the clubhouse. 

Triton 
Harriers 

(Continued from page 7) 
pionships on Saturday, the 
same course they ran two 
weeks ago in the Biola Invita-
tional. Coach Skief feels that 
this familiarity with the course 
will help his squad. 

Three years ago there was no 
UCSD cross country team. For 
the past two years the Tritons 
have finished sixth in the 
District II I finals , usually 
ahead of half the teams en· 
teredo Last year both Jacobson 
and Tom Grimm (just now 
coming off a leg injury) ran 
well enough to qualify for and 
go to the National NAJA Cross 
Country Championships in 
Wisconsin. 

With this background how 
will the squad fare this season? 
" We have a chance to be ODe of 
the top three- teams in the 
district , " remarked Coach 
Skief. "If we are , our team will 
have qualified to go to the 
national championships. We 
hope to be able to send as many 
rUDners to the midwest as 
possible. " 
, The toughest competition . 
facing the Tritons will be Point 
Lorna , Azusa Pacific , and 
Occidental. With the return of 
Jacobson and a healthy squad 
ready to go the prospects look 
very goud ,

mocrats Surge ' in 
WASH~TON (AP) -Dem-

ocrat. rcbed toward ren-
ewed co and of Congress 
yesterday nieht in an election 

~udded with Senate upset. that 
ousted Republican Sen. Ed-
ward Brooke of Massachusetts. 

But, voters in Mississippi 
installed Thad Cochran as the 
state's first popularly-elected 
Republican senator. 

Democratic Rep. Paul E. 
Tsongas, :n, beat Brooke, the 
only black senator, whose third 
term bid was crippled by his 
admitted misstatements about 
his personal finances in divorce 
testimony. 

In Maine, Rep. William S. 
Cohen, billed in advance as a 
potential national Republican 

leader, defeated Democratic 
Sen. William D. Hathaway. 

Democrat Carl Levin, 44, a 
former president of the Detroit 
City Council, led Michigan's 
Republican Senator Robert P 
Griffen, who first said he was 
quitting the Senate, then 
changed his mind. 

Sen. Charles H. Percy of 
Illinois was withstanding 
the challange of Democrat Alex 
Seith. Percy claimed victory 
their. 

In Texas, Democratic Rep. 
Robert Krueger edged ahead of 
Republican Sen. John Tower 
after a campaign more notable 
for name calling and big 
spending than for issues. 

CBS News said its projections 

showed Roger Jepsen, a former 
Lt. Governor whose conser~ 
vative campaigo seemed con-
stantly in trouble, would 
defeat Democratic Sen. Dick 
Clark of Iowa. 

In New Jersey, Bill Bradley, 
the former Princeton and New 
York Knick professional bas-
ketball player, won a Repub-
lican Senate seat for the 
Democrats. Bradley beat the 
conservative Jeffrey Bell to 
succeed Sen. Clifford Case. 

Nancy Landon Kassebaum, 
daughter of Alf, won Senate 
election in Kansas, holding a 
Republican seat and defeating 
former Rep. William Roy top 
become the season's one 
beneficiary of middle name 

San Diego Incumbents Sweep 
San Diego voters yesterday 

gave their nod to all incum-
bents seeking re-election to 
local, state and national posts, 
ap proved city and county 
government spending limits 
and appeared t-o reject a 
proposal to sell city land 
located near UCSD. 

Meanwhile, as of midnight, 
Del Mar voters were over-
whelmingly approving Prop-
osition P, which would allow the 
city to sell $400,000 in revenue 
bonds to improve the municipal 
water system. 

In the two local election 
battles that drew the most 
attention and produced the 
most fireworks - for the 78th 
state Assembly district and 4th 
county supervisorial district 
seats - the two~ incl!11lbents 

appeared headed for new terms 
in office. 

Both Assemblymen Larry 
KapiJoff, D-San Diego, and 
county Supervisor Jim Bates 
continued to widen their 
margins with 50 perent of the 
vote counted. 

KapiJoff had a 55-45 margin 
over challenger Terry Knoepp, 
while Bates had a 10,000 vote 
lead over Lee Hubbard. 

In the only otber closely 
contested local race, for the 5th 
District county supervisor's 
post, Paul Eckert had a narrow 
lead of 480 votes over Lorraine 
Byce, although only 11 percent 
of the vote was tabulated. ' 

None of the local propositions' 
caused much of a stir this year, 
although both Propositions G, 
to limit county spending, and J, 

to limit city spending, were 
approved by more than three-
to-one margins, 

One proposition of particular 
interest to the UCSD communi-
ty, Proposition K, which would 
allow the city to sell public 
lands near University Town 
Center, was losing by a 53-47 
margin. 

In the results from other 
races affecting the UCSD 
community, the new state 
Assemblyman for the Univer-
sity ' s district will be -Bob 
Frazee, the new state Senator 
will be Bob Craven and the 

Congre~sman will continue to 
be ,Clair Burgener. 

AU three men are Republi-
cans; they all won handily over 
their opponents.

CBS and NBC said that David 
Durenberger, 44, a Minneapolis 

. lawyer, had defeated Dem-
ocrat Bob Short in Minnesota, 
delivering to the Republicans 
the Senate seat of the late 
Hubert Humphrey. Short, a 
former baseball team owner, 
was often booed at campaign 
appearences, even when he was 
with the increasingly popular 
President Carter. 

And Rudy Boschwitz, 48, a

plywood manufacturer, was 
leading Democratic Sen. Wen-
dell Anderson, who had himself 
appointed to the Minnesota seat 
vacated by Vice President 
Mondale. NBC said Boschwitz 
was the winner. 

GOP House candidates led 
for 15 seats now held by 
Democrats. Democrats fed for 
six Republican seats, a net gain 
of nine seats for the Repub-
licans.
