Council allocated $4,700 to 11 media 
orgs for Winter Quarter at its meeting last 
night, following funding guidelines passed 
on Nov. 3. The new guidelines place a quar-
terly funding cap of $450 on existing media 
orgs and $200 for new orgs.

Following the recommendation of 
Associate Vice President of Student Orgs 
Carli Thomas and Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Andrew Ang, council allo-
cated the maximum $450 to 10 media orgs 
and $200 to the new media org Robot 
Report. 

Thomas said she is working on creating 
funding caps for all student organizations. 

She added that she designed the funding 
guidelines to prevent overallocations, but 
hopes it will it motivate media organizations 
to become independent.

“This was painful, actually, I know how 
much work goes into [media],” Thomas 
said.“[But] I don’t like to think of myself as 
a piggy bank.”

Thomas said the current funding model 
is based on a similar program at UC 
Riverside and other UC schools. According 
to UCR Organization Funding Specialist 
Maggie Godinez, Riverside gives a flat $750 
to all organizations. There is no specific 
funding for media, and anyone who wants 
to publish must independently make up the 
costs in membership dues and fundraising.

But Joe Trotten, business manager and 
former editor of Riverside’s official student 
newspaper The Highlander, said the funding 
model caused problems for student publica-
tions. 

Trotten said that Riverside has had only 
three major undergraduate newspapers in 
the last decade. Of these, Nuestra Cosa, a 
Chicano culture publication, has been print-
ing since 1972. Two others, The Praetorian 
and The X Factor, lasted less than two years.

Eleven UC students were arrested and 
four police officers were injured yesterday 
when a rally at the UC Board of Regents 
meeting held at UC San Francisco turned 
violent. 

Approximately 200 students and 100 UC 
workers gathered in front of a UCSF hall 
where the Regents were meeting  to protest 
UC President Mark G. Yudof ’s proposed 
8-percent fee increase.  The Regents will 
vote on the increase today.

About 15 of those students 
were pepper sprayed during 
their attempts to break though 
the barricades and into the 
meeting, according to Los 
Angeles Times.

At the meeting, tensions 
between students and police heightened 
when a police officer, having been struck in 
the head with his own baton, drew his gun 
in the center of a crowd of protestors. 

“It was unfortunate how violent the 
protest got,” UC Student Association 
President Claudia Magana said. “The 
students were frustrated. It showed how 
serious the issue was and how much the 
students care for it to get to a point where a 
gun was drawn.” 

Magana was one of the select Student 
Advocates to the Regents from UCSA that 
were inside the building at the meeting, 
advocating against the fee increase by 
speaking with the voting Regents present 
and speaking during the public comments 
section.

Douglas Wagoner, UCSB student and 
University Affairs Committee Chair, stated 
that the main purpose of the protests 
outside was to make the Regents aware 
of the effects the fee increases have on 
students. 

According to UCSA field organizer, 
Jaclyn Feldstein, while the student-led 
protests continued outside, the StaRs inside 
attempted to persuade the Regents by

arry Potter” has always flirted 
with darkness. Sure, we get a good 
Quidditch match and a couple 
of love triangles to break up the 
orphaned teen hero angst, but the 

series always manages to kill off a father figure 
or two at the end of every 700 pages. For the 
penultimate film, “Harry Potter and the Deathly 
Hallows Part 1,” even the smallest remnants of 
whimsy are left behind at Hogwarts with the 
Fat Lady, as our heroic trio ditches school and 
carves through the real world, encountering 
despair that can’t be fixed through extra points 
to Gryffindor. 

The old charms of Harry’s first year — a talk-
ing hat, flying brooms, moving portraits — have 
become more and more at odds with the series’ 
increasingly foreboding tone. With “Deathly 
Hallows,” however, third-time Potter director 
David Yates has finally settled with gloom, lend-
ing the film some much-needed consistency. 

The first of a two-part finale, “Deathly 
Hallows” is essentially a race between good 
and evil — a simple plot device, yes, but only 
on paper. With a smorgasbord of extraneous 
details, don’t expect much in the way of clarity.

UCSD Certified to Transplant Artificial Hearts
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Nisha Kurani
Associate News Editor

Heart failure patients in the Western 
United States can rest assured now that 
UCSD has become the first hospital in 
California certified to offer artificial 
heart transplants. 

The medical school was certified to 
perform these transplants on Nov. 17. 
The program was launched by heart 
surgeon Jack Copeland — who arrived 
at UCSD in July — and UCSD chief of 
cardiothoracic surgery Stuart Jamieson. 

Copeland is recognized as the 
first surgeon in the world to use the 
SynCardia Total Artificial Heart as a 
bridge to transplant in 1985, and since 
then has implanted more than 100 arti-
ficial hearts into patients.

Though the artificial heart is 
FDA-certified as a temporary trans-
plant rather that a permanent device, 
Copeland said that the device ends 
up as a permanent replacement for a 
real heart for those who are no longer 
eligible for heart transplants.

“It’s not approved for long term use; 

on the other hand, the patient with the 
device in place the longest [have had it] 
for over 1000 days and probably have 
no hope of ever getting a [permanent] 
transplant,” Copeland said. 

The cost of the device is around 
$125,000, while the cost of the proce-
dure to receive a heart is approximately 
$12,000. Additional costs include hos-
pital care, which is about $9,000 per 
day in the intensive care unit.

Copeland said he is working to 
ensure that UCSD Medical Center will 
be fully equipped, certified and trained 
to give patients artificial hearts by the 
end of December, a few months shy of 
the opening of UCSD’s $232 million 
cardiovascular center in April of 2011.

“It’s exciting how all of this is com-
ing together pretty much at the same 
time,” Copeland said. “Together, it can 
change the overall picture of this center 
to deliver the highest technology care…
in the most excellent environment that 
we can, so that UCSD becomes recog-
nized for this as well the many other 
things that it is already recognized for.”

The certification at UCSD caused 

minor concern at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital in Serra Mesa, which also 
offers heart transplants. Since 10 trans-
plant surgeries per year are mandated 
for a hospital to maintain its certifica-
tion, administrators and doctors wor-
ried that there might not be enough 
patients to fuel both hospitals’ needs.

The artificial heart is currently cer-
tified in 13 hospitals in the U.S., and is 
undergoing certification in nine other 
hospitals.

Snap your fingers, A.S. Council just added another tally to their list of meetings that finished 
under an hour.

cussed Part II of 
the All-Campus 
Dance with AVP 
Concerts and Events Brian Wong, 
who felt that the requested $22,100 in 
funding was too much money.

The Finance Committee brought 
forth the approval of the 2010-11 
media funding budget, which allocat-
ed  at total of $4,700 to 11 media orga-
nizations for Winter Quarter 2011.

VP Student Life Kristina Pham 
reminded councilmembers about 
a Dec. 6 Pancake Breakfast event, 
which will showcase a cappella 
groups performing holiday music for 
the first time.

Warren College President Alyssa 
Wing asked when the freshmen, 
transfer and division senators will be 
appointed, to which President Wafa 
Ben Hassine said that they will be 
chosen next Tuesday and the Tuesday 
after that. 

Under unfinished business, Wing 
objected to approving the College 
Council Funding Committee Charge 
Letter because she wanted to include 
Ben Hassine as ex oficio member in 
the committee.

Rena Zuabi was appointed 
as the social sciences senator and 
Benjamin Hass was appointed as the 
physical sciences senator, but these 
appointments didn’t come without 
opposition. Sixth College Senator 
Parminder Sandhu objected because 

he wanted to know why the candi-
dates were chosen. But the item was 
passed after Ben Hassine provided a 
generic response with no details on 
Zuabi. Council went into closed ses-
sion after Ben Hassine objected the 
appointment of Hass. 

Wong present-
ed updates on the 
Sun God Festival, 
unveiling a space 
theme for con-
cert and handed 
out eight snap 
bracelets. He said 

his office has drafted up a planning 
timeline. The budget is still in the 
brainstorming process and the office 
is looking for artists right now. 

Student Affirmative Action 
Committee representative Grant 
White said there will be an event 
today at 7:30 p.m., when the movie 
“Losing Isaiah” (featuring Halle 
Berry, as White duly noted) will be 
shown at the Triton Steps of Price 
Center East.

Ben Hassine said she was unahppy 
with poor attendance at committee 
meetings, pointing out that AVP Local 
Affairs Matthew Vu and Campuswide 
Senator Elizabeth Elman both missed 
their respective meetings. 

“People don’t show up,” Ben 
Hassine said. “These committees are 
really important and if you signed up, 
take the time to follow through.”

The meeting ended with a happy 
birthday song to Wong, whose birth-
day will be on Friday  — when he’ll be 
organizing the first Bear Garden of 
the quarter in addition to the Bruno 
Mars concert. 

No meeting will take place next 
week. Happy Thanksgiving, council.

beginning, but with staff turnover 
and looking for financing they don’t 
last very long,” Totten said. He added 
that even when they were operating, 
The X Factor and The Praetorian 
only printed once a quarter.

Media org leaders said the guide-
lines will hinder new papers from 
being started on campus.

Mania Magazine Editor in Chief 
Steve Bass said bigger publications 
like his can weather the cuts since 
Mania has an established audience 
that will help them court advertisers. 
But he added that it will be difficult 
for first-timers who have nothing to 
show, and that this will cause a lot of 
alternative voices to be silenced.

“If anybody wanted to start 

something up that they felt was 
really urgent, it’s going to be really 
hard for them,” Bass said. “It’s going 
to make UCSD a much more one-
dimensional campus.” 

New publications will have to get 
creative in how they publish, he said, 
and UCSD newspapers and maga-
zines should help each other out.

“I appreciate that in the past 
we’ve gotten everything from A.S. 
that we needed, or that we wanted,” 
Bass said. “So now that it’s over I’m 
not outraged. And from what I’ve 
seen, getting pissed can be entertain-
ing, but it doesn’t really get much 
done — it’s not going to help Mania 
at all.”

California Review Editor in Chief 
Alec Weisman said he thinks media 

orgs should be self-sufficient, but it 
is unfair that the students are paying 
into a system that doesn’t support 
them.

“We shouldn’t have to go and beg 
to get our money back,” Weisman 
said.

Thomas said media orgs can still 
request funding from the council’s 
operating budget. She added that 
the caps may be raised in the future, 
depending on the council’s finances.

Weisman said he fears that a 
precedent has been set the council 
will have little incentive to change it. 

“The institutional memory at 
UCSD is nil,” he said.

giving personal accounts of how the 
fee increases have increased their 
financial burden and limited their 
access to higher education.

“The students were definitely 
able to get the message out there,” 
Feldstein said. “They spoke about 
how the fee increase could actually 
affect them, their families and their 
siblings by essentially making it 
impossible for students to pay 
more.”

Feldstein also said that the 
arrested students — which included 
7 students from UC Berkeley, one 
each from UC Davis, UC Santa 
Cruz, UC Merced, and Peralta 
Community College plus two 
unknown individuals —  they acted 
of their own accord, and were not 
condoned by UCSA.

According to Magana, who 
spoke with some of the voting 
Regents and during the public 
comments section, many of the 
voting members said they are on 

the fence on the issue of the fee 
increase.  

She said the Regents explained 
that, due to the state’s strained 
budget and the lack of adequate 
funding to the UC system, some 
consider voting for the fee increase 
because there is no better solution, 
while others believe that the 
projected $114 million net revenue 
is not worth the negativity that 
surrounds the issue. 

The net revenue is calculated 
without the amount set aside for 
increased financial aid, which will 
be given in the form of grants to 
students with family incomes of 
$80,000 or less. 

UCSA plans to propose a 
standstill until a better proposal can 
be reached — one that doesn’t limit 
accessibility to students, Magana 
said. 

“[We want to propose] that 
they hold off on voting for the fee 
increase, see if they get funding 
from the state, and then decide 

whether the fee increase is really 
necessary,“ Magana said. “They 
can’t sell [the students] out 
without seeing what the state has 
to offer.”

While UCSA plans to speak 
about the option of a standstill 
during the meeting, many UC 
schools continue to raise awareness 
at their home institution. 

At UCSD, the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
will be hosting a live broadcast 
of the meeting on Library Walk 
on Thursday, Nov. 18, as well as 
hosting a sit-in at the Chancellor’s 
Complex at 8 a.m.

“It’s basically going be a sit-in at 
the Chancellor’s Complex [where] 
people are going to be watching the 
Regents meeting there and voice 
their opinions on how they feel 
about it,” sit-in organizer Chevelle 
Newell said.

Props to Staff Sgt. Giunta for being the first living Medal of Honor 
recipient since the Vietnam War for his heroic rescue under fire.

I feel like, for the most part, I’m pretty good with money. I don’t go out and drop truckloads of 
cash on designer clothes, or pimp out 
my car with every cool gadget the 
body shop has to offer. (The giant 
subwoofers in the trunk came with 
the car — I swear.) But when I went 
to pay my credit card bill at the end 
of last month, I was met with a nasty 
surprise. 

My first instinct when presented 
with the triple-digit bill was “Are you 
kidding me? Someone must’ve stolen 
my identity!” Even as I scrambled for 
my phone, intent on calling the bank, 
calling my mother, calling Santa — 
calling anyone that could help — I 
stopped mid-freak out when I actu-
ally looked at what I had purchased. 
I couldn’t find one item that I didn’t 
remember swiping my card for: $7.21 
at Los Primos, $3.45 at In ‘N Out, 
$6.25 at Hi Thai. The list went on 
and on. 

Conveniently, Wells Fargo lets you 
itemize your purchases into clever 
little categories like “shopping,” “gas” 
and “food.” Much to my surprise, over 
82 percent of my monthly spend-
ing went towards food. It had never 
occurred to me how often I was eat-
ing out, and how quickly it added up.  

It’s not just that takeout is more 
convenient — though having freshly 
prepared potato skins handed to me 
over a counter is an easier guarantee 
than trying to work my oven solo. 
The truth is, eating out is a social 
thing. 

This is especially useful when 
you’re in the awkward phase of a 
friendship, where you want to hang 
out, but you’re not quite comfort-
able sitting on the couch in pjs and 
watching TV while you do homework 
together. In this phase, every such 
occasion for hanging out starts with 
the same over-used conversation: 

“Let’s go out this Friday.”
“Sure, what’dya want to do?”
“Well, we can always grab dinner.”
I had to change, and change fast, 

before my bank account ran out on 
me. I made the decision: Not only 
was I going to (temporarily) stop eat-
ing out completely, but I also wanted 
to see if I could survive off $20 a week 
compared to my usual $100 or so.

The first day I embarked on this 
seemingly impossible mission, the 
Hare Krishna tent in the Old Student 
Center was serving up mouthwater-
ing curry that I could smell a mile 
away.  

But despite temptations — my 
coworker asking if I wanted anything 
from Shogun, my roommate eating 
Red Robin — I knew I really didn’t 
have any other choice. Unless I want-
ed to call my mother for money at the 
end of the month, $20 was all I had 
for the week. 

Over the course of one of the lon-
gest weeks of my life, I learned a few 
things:

First off, Bisquick is your best 
friend. When you’re living on a bud-
get, the giant $4 box of Bisquick from 
Costco becomes the Inspector Gadget 
of foodstuffs. Just grab your waffle 
maker, add some feta, garlic and basil 
and you have a delicious savory for 
waffle lunch or dinner.

A Change of 
Pace

In a Budget War, We Should Pick Our Battles
It’s down to us to pick up the slack, but while some things — like pensions and 

more kids from Kansas — are fair game, student fees should go untouched.

Last year’s 32-percent fee hike drew a huge reaction across California: Millions turned out for the March 4 Day of Action, in addi-
tion to those that made their voices heard at the 
November UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA. 
The outrage was everywhere, and UC President 
Mark G. Yudof spent most of the year justifying the 
move. But it looks like he didn’t learn his lesson, 
and — with the Regents voting on his proposed 
8-percent fee increase at their meeting at UC San 
Francisco this week — we’ll be the ones to pay the 
price.

The Regents know 
that when it comes 
down to it, students 
have no leverage. The 
only way for us to 
truly make an impact 
is to boycott the UC 
and deprive them of 
181,000 sources of rev-
enue. And while we’re not about to drop out, pretty 
soon we won’t be able to afford any other option.

This second fee increase is frustrating, it’s 
demoralizing, and it makes us feel like we’re part of 
a system that only cares about our ability to open 
our wallets. Even more depressing is the fact that in 
the history of the UC system, fee hikes have been 
implemented since its conception, but in 142 years 
tuition has never once decreased. 

The UC system was founded on the principle 
that it would provide the most accessible public 
and high-quality education to students in the state 
of California. But the more the system turns away 
from state funding and relies on our pocketbooks, 
the less accessible it becomes to every Californian. 

The sad thing is, there is no win-win here; 
when system is strapped for cash, it only has two 
real options. It can raise fees, or it can sacrifice the 
quality of education by increasing class sizes, add-
ing furlough days and reducing the selection of 
classes. As much as it kills us, we have to cough up 
if we want to keep attending our university.
MORE OUT-OF-STATE STUDENTS

The second, though less controversial, topic 
of discussion at the Regents meeting is the UC 
Commission on the Future recommendation that 

the campuses increase the number of out-of-state 
students. The Commission analyzed enrollment 
numbers from the 2008-09 school year and found 
that 6 percent — around 10,000 — of UC under-
graduates are from outside California. With this 
in mind, the commission asked for this number to 
rise to 10 percent, or 18,000 students. These extra 
8,000 kids will add to the university’s endowment 
to the tune of $91 million.

Opponents bring up important matters of 
diversity — accepting more affluent students, 

capable of paying the 
$23,000 tuition price 
tag, would be cut-
ting out the in-state 
students that need 
the lowered cost of 
public education to 
begin with. But the 
fact remains that 
each out-of-state 

student pays roughly twice the $11,124 the other 
94 percent of undergraduates pay. During this UC 
budget crisis, outsourcing the financial burden of 
higher tuition to those who voluntarily pay it is 
better than levying it on the rest of the students 
— many of whom can’t afford it. An 8 percent fee 
increase, coupled with the expanded financial aid, 
will affect 45 percent of current UCSD under-
graduates; that’s 81,000 students who would be 
forced to pay more, in comparison to 18,000 who 
are willing and able to shell out the money for a 
UCSD diploma. 
PRICIER EMPLOYEE PENSIONS

In November of 1990 — before some of its cur-
rent students were even born — the UC system 
found itself with a surplus in its pension plan. At 
that point, both the university and its employees 
stopped contributing money, choosing instead 
to ride on the state’s contribution, investments 
and the interest on the funds that already 
existed. Now, 20 years, some poor financial 
choices and an economic crisis later, pension 
payments are back and on the rise. But if those 
workers are going to have anything to support 
them when they’re old and grey, these changes 
need to happen.

One increase was passed in September, which 
said that, as of July 2012, employees will contrib-
ute 5 percent of their paychecks to a retirement 
plan, while the university will pay 10 percent. The 
discussion in November centers around future 
employees — specifically, those hired after July 
2013 — who would have a cap placed on their 
benefits, an increased minimum age of retirement, 
and contribute 5.1 percent of their paychecks to the 
current employees’ 5 percent.

UC employees haven’t contributed to this fund 
for almost two decades (payments started back 
up again at 3 percent in spring of this year), and 
now they’re facing $6.3 million in liabilities; if the 
program doesn’t undergo structural changes now, 
there will be no pension fund at all in a few years.

The UCLA website says that “One of the 
most attractive features of UC employment is the 
University of California Retirement Plan” — even if 
that means a smaller paycheck and a higher retire-
ment age, it’s worth it for the chance at a strong 
program that will draw new hires.  

It does look like a paycut; within the span of 
a few months, 3 percent of employees’ paychecks 
have virtually vanished, to be followed by another 
2 percent within the next couple years. But the uni-
versity is upping its contribution as well. This isn’t 
a burden shouldered by employees alone, but by 
the system overall, which should ultimately benefit 
the worker. 

The smaller paycheck now will come back 
in the form of post-retirement financial security, 
including medical benefits and the option of a 
lump sum cash out — it’s not like this money is 
vanishing into thin air. If it comes down to a col-
lapsing retirement fund or paying a little more out 
of pocket now to support yourself 20 years down 
the road, then there’s no contest.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
On July 31, 2009, Sarah Shourd, 

Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal had 
been enjoying a recreational hike 
in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan 
when Iranian forces captured them. 
After suffering 410 days in solitary 
confinement, Sarah Shourd was 
released. Grievously, her fiancée, 
Shane Bauer, and close friend, Josh 
Fattal, still remain detained.

All three individuals are recent 
graduates of the University of 
California, Berkeley. This detail, 
along with the enormously inhu-
mane and arbitrary nature of their 
imprisonment, must propel us all 
into action. While the families of 
both men continue their pleas for 
help, we must acknowledge the 
severity of these human rights viola-
tions and dissolve our complacency.

As we all are University of 
California students, the pain 
endured by Sarah, Shane and Josh 
impacts us on a sharply tender and 
personal level. We must unite as 
a community, in order to solidly 
express our deep concerns for these 
three individuals, and for similar 
inhumane acts that have happened 
before, are happening now and will 
happen in the future.

Nov. 4 marked the 31st anni-
versary of the Iranian hostage cri-

sis. During this tragedy — which 
sparked tensions between the United 
States and Iran — 52 American 
citizens suffered imprisonment for 
444 days. Unbelievably, the num-
ber of days Shane Bauer and Josh 
Fattal have spent detained exceeds 
444. And yet, not enough people 
have acknowledged that this is a 
crisis just the same. These people 
have been unjustly detained by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran the 
past year and have had their rights 
denied to them.

Your university’s participation 
in passing a resolution for appeal-
ing the release of Shane and Josh 
will represent a step away from the 
apathy that often allows such actions 
to take place. It will illuminate the 
importance of not only feeling sym-
pathy, but also transforming those 
feelings into action.

Secondly, you’ll surprise yourself 
at how creative you really can be 
when it comes 
to scrounging 
together a meal. 
When I packed 
my car and 
headed down 
to San Diego 
at the end of 
the summer, 
my mother 
wouldn’t let 
me leave without sending a trunkful 
of food with me. Mom-fare has gone 
largely unnoticed for the last three 
months, but last week, those awkward 

canned artichoke hearts made for a 
perfect complement to my $1 bag of 
pasta. 

The third, and most exciting, 
discovery 
is that fresh 
fruits and 
vegetables 
really aren’t 
as expen-
sive as you 
think. I read 
a study in 
Michael 
Pollan’s 

Omnivore’s Dilemma about how there 
are more low-income obese people 
in America, because fresh veggies are 
too expensive. My own experience 

tells me otherwise; at Trader Joe’s you 
can pick up a giant bag of salad for 
$1.29. 

Although the week was long — 
and painfully included me brown 
bagging it to work — I was able to 
successfully live off of $20. Of course, 
I’m not going to be withdrawing a 
single 20-dollar bill for food every 
week now, but I like to think I found 
a happy medium.  I am eating at 
home more often,  while still occa-
sionally splurging on a bowl of rare 
beef pho at Pho La Jolla. Eating out 
all the time doesn’t sit well with my 
wallet, and eating on such a tight 
budget doesn’t sit well with social life. 
But when you’re in a pinch, it’s pos-
sible to make those $20 bills stretch.

Watson) set out to destroy Voldemort’s (a 
chilling Ralph Fiennes) Horcruxes (hor-
what?). Meanwhile, the Dark Lord is on a 
hunt of his own, searching for the Deathly 
Hallows — a trio of magical objects that 
make its owner the master of death — as 
the kids begin to catch up, step by painfully 
slow step.

Yet the 146-minute running time 
doesn’t feel longer than the usual Potter 
flick, since the director makes a tangible 
effort not to get too bogged down by the 
books’ plot-heavy details. It’s really a film 
for the die-hards: Yates doesn’t spell any-

thing out for you (we’re 
never even given a refresher 
on what those pesky 
Horcruxes are again). But 
while you may need ency-
clopedic knowledge of the 
series to follow the intrigue, 

if you’ve been a Potter scholar all your life, 
the trip will be engrossing from the start.  

As director, Yates is competent enough 
— since “Order of the Phoenix,” his 
dialogue-heavy scenes have been stronger 
than his action sequences, which are pass-
able but conventional. Because Harry and 
the crew spend most of this movie camping 
out, hiding from Voldemort’s Gestapo-
esque “Snatchers” and talking about 
Horcruxes and their feelings, it finally feels 
like Yates is in his element. The action 
comes in brief bursts, punctuating the 
lengthier moments of picturesque empti-
ness that fill the majority of the movie — a 
style not unlike last year’s adaptation of 
Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road.” 

“Deathly Hallows” indebts itself a lot 
more to such post-apocalyptic tales than 
the usual fantasy, with much of the magic 
replaced by sparse, dystopian scenery. 
Cinematographer Eduardo Serra (“Girl 
With a Pearl Earring”) scopes out more 

forlorn mountains, snowy pastures and 
somber forests than you thought possible in 
a Potter flick. In these pretty scenes, pretty 
actors do pretty acting — staring off into 
space, crying and getting fed up with each 
other. 

The actors handle the melodrama with 
effective gusto. We’ve seen the trio grow 
up from wooden kid-actors to nuanced 
performers. “Part 2” will certainly belong 
to (or be destroyed by) Daniel Radcliffe, 
but here Rupert Grint finally gets to shine. 
Grint’s believably jealous Ron provides the 
film’s most relatable story arc as he faces his 
demons, both literal and figurative, and — 
wait for it — a naked makeout sesh from 
Harry and Hermione (in a nightmare, of 
course).

The fabulous set of British character 
actors that play the adults — with the new 
addition of Billy Nighy as Minister of Magic 
Rufus Scrimgeour — are regrettably unde-
rused, save for Fiennes, whose terrifying 
Voldemort gets more screen time than ever 
before. But that comes with the territory of 
this particular half of the source material. 
For now, the focus is entirely on the teen 
runaways. 

It’s the little things that make it an 
interesting film and not just another rough 
adaptation like the first few films of the 
series. The score by Alexandre Desplat is 
exciting, subtle and emotional, and a beau-
tifully rendered animated sequence (super-
vised by Ben Hibon) that tells the story of 
the Deathly Hallows shows some splendid 
creativity you wish they would have discov-
ered earlier. 

“Deathly Hallows” is one of the best 
films in the Potter series; its biggest draw-
back really lies in its two-part nature. It 
spends so long building up the momentum 
for a finale, though it can’t deliver until 
“Part 2” comes out next July. What we’re 
left with is a respectfully made, though 
unsurprising, dark mystery that gives us all

SORCERER’S STONE — Harry’s parents are killed by the evil Lord Voldemort. At age 11, 
Harry is living out his days in his aunt’s home, unwanted. When he finds out he’s a wizard, 
Harry accepts an invitation to study at Hogwarts School of Magic.  While he’s there, Harry 
befriends Ron and Hermione, his future best friends. The trio suspect Professor Snape of 
wanting to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone and aim  to intercept him, but encounter the devious 
Professor Quirrell instead.  Harry faces and defeats Voldemort for a second time.

CHAMBER OF SECRETS — A Hogwarts student releases a basilisk from the Chamber 
of Secrets. When Hermione is petrified and Ron’s little sister, Ginny, is taken to the 
Chamber, it’s up to Harry and Ron to defeat the giant snake. Unfortunately,  a rockslide 
prevents Ron from traveling deeper into the Chamber and Harry is left to defeat the creature 
on his own, with only Fawkes  — Headmaster Dumbledore’s phoenix — and the sword of 
Godric Gryffindor as his aides. Harry stabs the reptile, rescues Ginny and escapes.

PRIZONER OF AZKABAN — Sirius Black, Harry’s estanged godfather and the man 
who supposedly betrayed Harry’s parents to Voldemort, escapes from a high-security peni-
tentiary, Azkaban, and sets out to find Harry. Meanwhile, another one of Harry’s father’s 
friends, Remus Lupin, takes a job as a professor at Hogwarts. But Lupin suffers from an 
affliction   — every full moon, he transforms into a werewolf.  Sirius finally meets Harry, 
explains that he’s not responsible for his parents’ demise and offers him a new home.

GOBLET OF FIRE — Two foreign schools (Beauxbatons and Durmstang) head to 
Hogwarts to compete in the Triwizard tournament. Student’s names are dropped into the 
Goblet of Fire, which chooses a champion to represent each. Though Harry is underage, the 
Goblet chooses him, along with Cedric Diggory, to represent Hogwarts. The duo are the 
first to grab the Triwizard cup in the third task, transporting them into Voldemort’s clutches. 
Cedric is killed by Death Eaters (Voldemort’s followers) and Harry narrowly escapes.

ORDER OF THE PHOENIX — Harry believes that Sirius has been kidnapped by 
Voldemort and rallies his friends to rescue him. But when the gang gets to the Ministry they’re 
ambushed by Death Eaters. When the kids seem doomed,  the Order of the Phoenix,  a group 
of anti-Voldemort and Harry-supporting adults, take the reins. In a bitter twist of irony, Sirius 
is killed by Voldemort’s leading lady, his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange. Voldemort appears dur-
ing the battle and duels with Dumbledore, but disappears when the Minster of Magic arrives. 

HALF-BLOOD PRINCE — Dumbledore tells Harry that he has to find four Horcruxes 
(objects that Voldemort has put part of his soul into) and destroy them to make the villain 
mortal. Meanwhile, Harry learns dark magic from notes in a textbook penned by the Half-
Blood Prince. The duo goes to retrieve another Horcrux, but the headmaster is seriously 
injuried in the gambit. When they return to Hogwarts, Snape — the Half-Blood Prince — 
kills Dumbledore and escapes, as a battle erupts between the Death Eaters and the Order.

8ÊTHE UCSD GUARDIANÊ THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2010Ê HIATUS

B etween the Bush-bashing, Taylor-crushing and pornographic album cover, it’s a shock Kanye West even 
spent enough time in the studio to pro-
duce a complete, finished album. But on 
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the 
rapper marries his signature dick-swing-
ing lyrics with grandiose instruments, 
creating a perfect crescendo of sound and 
ego that continues from the first track to 
the last.

Fantasy takes the best of experimental 
kid-brother attempt 808s and Heartbreaks 
and injects the throwback heart of ’05 
West-classic Late Registration to create 
the most complete hip-hop LP the genre 
has seen in years. If hip-hop still has a 
pulse, it’s Kanye. His latest couples the 
top dogs of hip-hop (Alicia Keyes, RZA) 
with African drumbeats, violin strings 
and plucky piano notes — he’s not just 

making music, he’s the pied piper of the 
mainstream.  

And Kanye knows it: “My presence is 
a present, kiss my ass,” he demands on 
the pitch-black and drum-heavy haunt 
“Monster,” as a growling Jay-Z and shriek-
ing Nicki Minaj join in on the destruc-
tion. On summer single “Power,” Kanye 
continues the percussion trend, as he spits 
about a man caught up in the glamour of 
his own fame over a synth-warped King 
Crimson sample and a chorus of wailing 
African goddesses. “Runaway”  is beauti-
ful in its minimalism, featuring a steady 
stream of piano tinkling as Kanye turns 
down the bravado enough to reveal a 
shred of modesty (“You been putttin’ up 
with my shit just way too long”).

Not that Kanye’s been lazy on the 
album’s remainders. Each ditty plunges the 
listener into an unexplored facet of Kanye’s 

psychosis. Some are dark and twisted, oth-
ers are warm extremities left numb and 
raw by the cold frigidity of songs like “So 
Appalled.” On “All of the Lights,” the beat 
rushes, scattered, as trumpets ring out. 
A persistent chorus of feedback synth — 
bordering on dubstep — runs through 
“Hell of a Life.” Though “All of the Lights” 
features a “We are the World”-worthy host 
of A-listers (an M.I.A.-esque Fergie, Elton 
John and Rihanna), Kanye is decidedly the 
star of each piece. His vetted swag is never 
overshadowed by the song’s backdrop or 
contributing artists. Instead, they carry 
him, framing his scene-stealing ballads.

As always, lyrical purists need not 
apply; Kanye is still self-promoting. He 
devotes the entire latter half of “Blame 
Game” to chest thumping, as a guy praises 
a girl’s progression with charmers like 
“My dick thanks you” and “Who got your 
pussy reupholstered?” to which she duti-
fully responds “Yeezy taught me.”  

Sure, he may still be a PHD (pretty 
huge dick), but he’s got us tripping off 
Fantasy’s power — something that hasn’t 
happened since he struck gold with 
“Touch the Sky.” For once, there’s no need 
to apologize.

O ver the course of his surprisingly long career, Nelly has 
released some great songs: 
“Country Grammar,” “Ride 
Wit Me,” “Hot In Herre” 
and “Grillz,” to name a few. 
That’s a pretty successful 
track record, especially 
for someone as gleefully 
oblivious to artistic devel-
opment as Nelly. However, 
the Nelly behind 5.0 is 
not the same Nelly that 
so charmingly invited us 
to take off all our clothes. 
This Nelly just makes 
really, really bad music. 

No matter how 
intently you search, there 
is absolutely nothing on 
5.0 worth listening to. 
The raps are uninspired 
(rhyming party and 
Bacardi ain’t new, buddy), 
the production is annoy-
ing (siren effects and 
horns galore!) and the 
numerous guest spots are 
either uniformly terrible 
(who let Diddy rap on 
this?) or wasted on songs 
that are just plain boring. 

“Just A Dream,” the 
album’s first single, is built 
on the kind of cheesy, late-
nineties radio rock guitar 
riff that Nelly might have 
been able to get away with 
a decade ago. “Move Your 
Body,” despite being pro-

duced by Bangladesh — 
the genius behind “What’s 
Your Fantasy,” “A Milli” 
and “Videophone” — is 
home to one of the most 
uninteresting vocal hooks 
T-Pain has ever sung. 

Drowned in over-
produced club beats (and 
those damn air horns 
again), even Keri Hilson, 
who by now is probably 
used to redeeming forget-
table tracks, is unable to 
salvage “Liv Tonight” from 
Nelly’s “we be poppin’ 
bottles, makin’ noise” buf-
foonery.    

Granted, “She’s So Fly” 
— the album’s best and 
only listenable track — is 
a moderately compelling 
mid-tempo jam with a 
decent T.I. verse and an 
interesting sub-bass drum 
breakdown.

But barring any 
unforeseen changes, the 
uninspired production of 
5.0 stands as a solid confir-
mation that Nelly’s career 
is over. It especially pales 
in comparison to much of 
the hip-hop released lately. 
Do yourself a favor and lis-
ten to Kanye’s new album 
instead. Nelly should have 
done the same.

My javelin flew over the heads of the 
officials and sent them scurrying to mark the 
spot, well past where they expected it to land. 
I had won, I had done in 2009 what my father 
had done exactly 30 years before in 1979, 
Champion in the Javelin in the CCAA.

As I mounted the podium, the rain 
stopped, but the sun refused to show itself. 
The thunder continued. My mom cried, as 
expected, and my dad smiled, and then I 
knew. 

My victory, imitating his own, was not 
marred by his own sadness of being overshad-
owed, but rather, but rather he was basking in 
the light of his son, who had his own storm 
building, his own passion and drive. 

MVP of the league went to a sprinter. “Of 
course,” I mumbled to my teammate George, 
who stood with my family and teammates in 
the center of the masses of teams gathered 
on the infield of the track, centered around 
the awards podium in the murky weather. 
Sprinters get all the glory in track and field. It 
is irksome to say the least. 

After the highlight of victory, I was on my 
way down to the level of the horrible weather, 
when my name blared across the stadium.

Surprised, I started and looked up, 
repeating, the voice said, “Nicholas Howe: 
Freshman of the Year.” I stumbled to the 
podium, my packed bags ready for the long 
bus ride home weighing me down into the 
muddy field. 

Dropping them on the ground with a 
squelch, spattering several sprinters acci-
dentally with mud, I accepted the award and 
mounted the podium. Looking out across 
the crowd, I saw my dad’s face standing out 
above the rest, the mountain rising above the 
clouds. Our eyes met and his welled up with 
tears as I lifted the award above my head with 
one hand and pointed to him with the other.

Track and field is like a family with the 
father being the coach, or a special athlete 
who takes the lead. 

We all have our special leaders who 
inspire us. For all of us athletes, we need this 
persona in front of us to show the way. Mine 
happened to be my dad.

GOLF — The UCSD Golf Team 
battled through their three fall tour-
naments, finding modest success 
in individual results despite disap-
pointing team performances. The 
squad now takes a winter break 
until February.

The team returned from their 
first tournament in Washington 
with disappointing team results 
but high individual potential.  The 
Tritons competed at the Western 
Washington Invitational September 
27 to 28, UCSD came in 11th out of 
15 schools, finishing with a three-
round score of 891. Freshman Jacob 
Williams was the top individual 
finisher and ended with a 215 total 
— good enough to place seventh 
individually. 

UCSD competed at the InterWest 

Wildcat Classic hosted by Chico 
State on Oct. 11 to 12, where the 
team tied for 15th with Notre Dame 
de Namur University. UCSD had a 
shotgun start, and adverse weather 
conditions were a problem. Rain 
and wind made the course difficult. 

Williams led the Tritons with a 
total score of 230. Senior captain 
Keith Okasaki shot a 239 over the 
four-round tournament.

“[I] just made too many little 
mistakes I don’t normally make,” 
Okasaki said. “[I’ll] just try correct 
that [next time].” 

Sophomore Fredrik Palmer 
followed closely with a 240, and 
Richard Morris rounded out 
UCSD’s scorers with a 244. 

“It was a combination of lacklus-
ter play and bad other things that 
happened,” Wydra said. “We had 
arguably the worst performance our 
team has had in quite some time. 
Since then, we’ve regrouped.” 

Osakie also said the players will 
look to put the tournament behind 
them.

“Hopefully the team plays better 
— as we should,” he said.

The Tritons then hosted the 
UCSD Triton Invitational Nov. 
1 to 2. Although UCSD came in 
fourth overall out of four teams 

competing, the Tritons’ team score 
of 884 was only two shots back of 
St. Martin’s score of 882. 

“[It was] a pretty good show-
ing,” head coach Mike Wydra said. 
“A very high level of play from our 
guys.”

Williams came in tenth indi-
vidually with a 219 overall score, 
and Okasaki led the team by tying 
for seventh place individually with 
a 218 overall. 

Sonoma State’s “A team” took the 
overall title, while their “B team” 
took second. 

Wydra said it was helpful for the 
team to compete together at a time 
in the season when many of the 
players work on their game alone.

 “It’s motivated a lot of the guys 
to want to work on their game,” 
Wydra said. “In this off part of 
the season we’ve been down at the 
range a lot, and I think we’re going 
to get better quickly.”

After tough going in their first 
two tournaments, these results 
are encouraging for when the 
team returns to the green on Feb. 
7th for the Cal State San Marcos 
Invitational.

He first started coaching at a tiny 
junior college where the track was 
dirt and the throwing field was full 
of rocks that, every twilight practice, 
mangled and chomped instruments 
like a fat kid at dinner. Before and 

after coaching, he would strap on 
his spikes or lifting shoes and sweat 
for hours: throwing, lifting, striv-
ing for the life of his dreams, living 
for the moment and the future. In 
the moldy gym and rocky field, 
he made a return to the sport that 
he in college considered a sideline 
matter: throwing the javelin. Even 
as a sideline sport way back when, 
he won the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association (CCAA) Track 
and Field Championship for the 
javelin in 1979. 

His trophies are in a tiny cabinet 
in a dingy room under the house. 
Two read “All-American in Track 
and Field”, one reads “MVP Pro-Am 
Championship 1986,” another reads 
similarly, but this time for 1987. The 
lists go on with “CCAA Champion” 
and other awards far greater than 
any my brothers or I have achieved. 
Yet his awards are under the house, 
and ours are displayed in glaring 
lighting everywhere you turn on 
every wall. Our every little success 
means more to him than every great 
sports achievement he ever had,  
more than all of them combined.

Leaning into the wind, he stood 
with glasses and gray-streaked hair, 
but with a back unbent by age, a 
presence felt by all, undiminished 
by the turning, grinding machi-
nations of time, of age. He was a 
champion, and he was watching me 
in my own CCAA Championship 
Meet on that stormy day.

I was focused, no thoughts but 
“hit it” running through my head 
as I stood on the tartan runway. My 
father stood along the fence to my 
right, the broken down facilities 
of Chico State melting and sagging 
under the weight of the worst rain-
storm I have seen outside my moth-
erland of Texas. The bleachers were 
rusted to the point of collapse, the 
wood rotten, the sudden cold in the 
middle of May bringing everything 
to a crawl across the track. The 
tartan rubber was horrible, little 
better than the dirt and rocks my 
father had coached and trained on 
all those years ago.

Sitting on my heels, rain lancing 
down my face, I closed my eyes to 
enhance my sense of feel, of touch, 
of being. I prayed for a blessing. 
Wearing little more than tights, the 
cold cut into my bones, but I felt 
nothing, heard nothing, was noth-
ing but existence. I became force, 
unhindered by mortal bounds. 
Limbs and muscles are for the 
weak, I was rock, stone. I was the 
storm. None of the competitors had 
a chance.

Imitating my dad, I lightning-
skittered down the track and let 
loose my own thunder, creating 
my own dreams, stepping alongside 
him, in line with him, sharing in 
our victory.

Although the regular season didn’t go as smoothly as planned, the UCSD Women’s Volleyball team still made it to its fifth straight NCAA  Division II tour-
nament. The Tritons will start their postseason run against 
conference rivals Sonoma State on Thursday.

The Tritons were given an at-large bid to the tournament 
and received the fourth seed in the West Region, setting up 
the third meeting of the season between the two squads. The 
Tritons have won both matches, sweeping the first on their 
home court, then being pushed to five sets in the match in 
Sonoma. Though UCSD is 22-5 against the Seawolves all-
time, Thursday will be the first meeting between the squads 
in the postseason.

“I think we have to go into this game more prepared than 
the last one,” junior libero Janessa Werhane said. “When we 
played them away we took them to five, and I think that tells 
us that we can’t take this team lightly.” 

The Tritons are making their fifth straight trip to the 
tournament, and 10th overall. UCSD has missed the post-
season only once since moving to Division II. The Tritons 
have won their first round game for four of the last five 
years. 

Sonoma State is making its third straight appearance, 
but the Seawolves are still looking for their first win in the 
playoffs. 

Werhane said the NCAA tournament makes the match-
up different despite the familiarity with their opponents.

“I think you have it hanging it over your head: It’s not 
conference anymore, it’s single elimination,” Werhane said. 
“You have to go all out, or else you go home. I think that puts 
a little extra drive in the way we play and what we want to do 
here. You have to recognize that this is it.” 

Cal State San Bernardino earned the No. 1 seed in the 
West Region with a 25-2 overall record, and will host all 
of the West Region matches. The Coyotes — who captured 
their fifth straight CCAA title this season — will play eighth-
seeded BYU-Hawaii. The Coyotes have won 43 straight 
matches on their home court, although their last loss came to 
UCSD in 2008. Should the Tritons emerge victorious against 
Sonoma State, they will play the winner of that match.

UCSD suffered a five-game losing streak early in the 
season, the program’s longest since 1992. But the Tritons 
were able to right the ship, and won 13 of their remaining 
15 matches with the only blemishes being two losses to San 
Bernardino. 

The Tritons have relied on a strong rotation of veterans 
for success. Junior outside hitter Katie Condon leads the 
team in kills and points, and versatile junior Roxy Brunsting 
has had multiple triple-double matches since starting to see 
time as a setter mid-season. Finally, Werhane has been the 
clear defensive leader for the Tritons has topped the team 
in digs. 

“We don’t need to change anything,” Werhane said. “We 
just need to come in here and know that we’ve had a good 
season and we turned it around. We know how to play vol-
leyball and we know how to play it well.”

The UCSD-Sonoma State match will start at 5 p.m. on 
Thursday, Nov. 18 at Cal State San Bernardino’s Coussoulis 
Arena. If the Tritons advance past Sonoma State, they will 
play on Friday at 7:30 p.m. against the winner of the match 
between Cal State San Bernardino and BYU-Hawaii.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL

UCSD has played Sonoma State twice this season, with the 
Tritons taking both matches. The team swept the Seawolves 3-0 
early in the season at RIMAC Arena, but escaped with a narrow 3-2 
victory in Sonoma on Oct. 15. The Tritons have won 11 of their last 
12, with their only loss to No. 6 Cal State San Bernardino. 

The Seawolves finished the season with a 17-9 overall record 
and took fourth place in conference, just behind UCSD. Sonoma 
earned the fifth seed in the West Region to make the postseason 
for the third straight year, although the Seawolves have yet to 
advance out of the first round. 

If the Tritons can avoid mistakes, the match is theirs to lose. To
