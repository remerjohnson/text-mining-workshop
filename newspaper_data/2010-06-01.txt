The A.S. Council passed an expanded version of its 2010–11 budget last Wednesday, 
which heavily increased diversity and 
athletics allocations from the draft  
originally proposed by A.S. President 
Wafa Ben Hassine and Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Andrew 

Ang. 
This tempo-

rary budget will 
be in effect until 
Week Three of 
Fall Quarter, 
when the coun-
cil will finalize 
all  allocations 
and distribute 
any remaining 
funds. 

Since the 
approved bud-
get allocates 
more money 

than  the original draft, the amount the 
council has not yet reserved — to be 
finalized Fall Quarter — has dropped 
from $219,505.09 to $194,549.63.

According to Ang, the most conten-
tious addition to the A.S. budget was the 
inclusion of the new  Winter Comedy 
event, proposed by Vice President of 
Student Life Kristina Pham and newly

The three UCSD student co-
ops requested funds from the A.S. 
council last week, in order to hire 
a certified public accountant to 
organize their financial records. 
Councilmembers agreed to pay a  
third of the cost.

The co-ops — the Food Co-Op, 
the General Store and Groundwork 
Books — have been asked by 

Professional accountant 
could help co-ops stay on 
top of their finances.

Not every story ends happily ever after. The UCSD baseball team’s incredible season came 
to a heartbreaking end on Saturday, 
as the No.1-ranked team in Division-
II fell 6-4 to No. 9 University of 
Southern Indiana. 

The Tritons seemed unstoppable 
after taking their first three games 

at the College World Series, held in 
Cary, N.C., from May 22 to May 29. 
However — poised to top off what 
was perhaps the best year in pro-
gram history with a national title — 
UCSD was stopped just short by the 
Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles.

AS PER USUAL By Dami Lee

TWO COKES SHORT By Sam Pelle

elected Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Brian Wong. 
Pham and Wong requested $30,000 to 
fund the project, a replacement of the 
annual WinterFest concert — an event 
that was discontinued two years ago.

“We’d like to bring a comedy fes-
tival to our events, just to have some-
thing nice in the winter,” Wong said 
at the meeting. “It’s also a mix-up of 
FallFest and Sun God.”

Though she approved them all, Ben 
Hassine expressed reservations about 
the additional allocations.

“I’m really worried that we might 
be spending a little too much within 
our own offices, and I just feel like, 
especially with office of Concerts and 
Events, [it] takes up a lot of funding 
that we can look at little more,” Ben 
Hassine said.

Though Pham’s comedy event was 
added as a line item, the council did 
not guarantee it any specific amount 
of funds. According to Ang, funding 
for the event will be drawn from man-
date reserves — the council’s backup 
fund supply — during the Fall Revise 
process.  He added that the event will 

be a one-time trial; if it is successful, 
it may be  may be more permanently 
integrated into to the 2011–12 budget. 

The council also increased funding 
for diversity projects from an originally 
proposed $300 to $1,000. 

AVP of Diversity Affairs Alyssa 
Peace said she requested more 
money in order to hold events during 
Welcome Week. Because the tempo-
rary budget is good through  Week 
Three of Fall Quarter, she would 
not have been able to hold events 
otherwise. 

“Kristina [Pham] and I haven’t 
planned what our Welcome Week pro-
gram will be, but we’re thinking some-
thing on Library Walk in conjunction 
with the Cross-Cultural Center that 
shows students what resources are 
available to them,” Peace said. 

Similarly, the athletics allocations 
increased from $3,000 to $9,650 
at the request of AVP of Athletic 
Relations Pauline Nuth. 

Nuth said she requested the 
increase in order to fund sum-
mer outreach programs — such as 
working with orientation leaders 
to encourage athleticism and game 

attendance. 
“Last year, the full line item for 

athletic relations [was $24,000], so 
$3,000 was really low — even just for 
Fall Quarter,” Nuth said. 

In addition, A.S.-distributed U.S. 
Grants were expanded to $22,500 
from the original $7,500 because 
the former AVP of College Affairs 
requested the entire year’s alloca-
tion, instead of just up to fall quarter. 
According to Ang, U.S. Grants are 
scholarships students can request for 
research projects they are working 
on with faculty. 

The allocation to the UC Student 
Association was increased from 
$8,000 to $10,000 because Vice 
President of External Affairs Michael 
Lam is trying to mobilize 50 students 
to attend the UCSA Congress, usual-
ly held in March, at $200 per student. 

Ang said he was satisfied with the 
revised increases to the budget. 

“We would have made most chang-
es anyway during Fall Quarter, so I’m 
pretty OK with the changes,” Ang said.

The malicious car that murders 
its driver — a la Stephen King’s 
“Christine” — used to be mere urban 
legend. However, the high-tech auto-
mobiles of tomorrow could make the 
nightmare a modern-day reality. 

Digitized vehicles — which 
include features like anti-lock 
brakes, automatic seatbelts and 
automatic door locks — are becom-
ing increasingly popular. Because 
of this, a research group including 
computer-science graduate student 
Steve Checkoway is concerned that 
computer hackers may be able to 
gain remote access to such vehicles. 
The more wireless network technol-
ogy advances, the more gateways for 
remote access will open for hackers 
to exploit.

“As cars become more connected 
to the outside world, the attack surface 
will increase,” Checkoway said. 

To test the possibilities of remote 
manipulation, researchers developed 
CarShark — a software program 
that observes, takes apart and inserts 
code, into car computers. This way, 
they can test how easy it will be for 
unauthorized individuals or technol-
ogy, to command a car’s functions. 

“[CarShark] was written by us to 
interact with the various computers 
in the car,” Checkoway said. “It was 
developed incrementally, adding 
functionality as the need arose.”

To test  CarShark, the researchers 
connected a digitized car to a laptop. 

Another laptop was used to wire-
lessly link and control the original 
laptop running CarShark — enabling 
the hacker to remotely access the 
vehicle’s many functions. 

Initially, the researchers thought 
they would have to locate specific 
vulnerable points before hacking the 
car. However, they were able to adjust 
the car’s functions simply by insert-
ing random codes into the car to see 
how it would affect the system. If the 
computer systems had been secure, the 
insertion of random codes would not 
have affected the car in any way. The 
results demonstrated that computer-
ized cars are insecure — extremely 
easy to damage and attack. 

The extent of potential manipula-
tion ranged from mere annoyances 
— such as unlocking all doors or 
popping the trunk — to more imme-
diate danger, like killing the engine. 

According to Checkoway, execut-
ing this type of attack would requires 
a high level of computer proficiency 
in a field most hackers are still 
unaware of. Checkoway stressed that 
current vehicles currently on the 
market do not yet have the techno-
logical features to be at risk  — the 
research was performed on future 
generations of automobiles, which 
will rely on digital technology as 

their main source of control.
“We don’t believe that car own-

ers should be overly concerned at 
this time,” Checkoway said. “The 
benefits of having modern, com-
puterized cars far outweigh the 
dangers posed by the attack. For 
example, anti-lock brakes, stabil-
ity control, seatbelts that predict 
crashes and tighten preemptively 
and automatic notification of first 
responders in the event of a crash 
are just a few of the many benefits 
computerized cars offer.”

Checkoway said it’s unlikely an 
infallible defense against car hacking 
will be created as there are so many 
possible modes for attack. He said 
that cars are increasingly integrated 
with computers, new security holes 
are created.

However, he added that the 
research group has informed undis-
closed automobile manufacturers 
about the vulnerabilities of comput-
erized automobiles.

“Before going public with this 
information, we disclosed the vulner-
abilities to all of the relevant stakehold-
ers,” Checkoway said.“The response 
we received has been very positive.”

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE

JERRY BROWN
S on to a former California governor — and lifted into the position himself after the Reagan regime — Democrat 
Jerry Brown was born for this stuff. 

After 40-plus years in state government, 
he is a living caricature of the steadfast lib-
eral “nice guy,” with a husky-voiced sincer-
ity and track record that makes him hard 
to pick apart as anything but the real thing.

At this point, though, Brown’s status as 
default Sacramento nobility gives his sec-
ond stab at governorship an air of sketchi-
ness. He’s been too cocky to release a single 
game plan for the coming term, meanwhile 
flicking all other legitimate Democratic 
contenders out of the race with a lifetime 
of special-interest connections to back him.

Still, even if all we have to go off are 
Brown’s past accomplishments, they are 

groundbreaking and many.  
Brown gave the Cesar Chavez worker-

rights movement a leg up by refusing 
to send state troopers in to break up 
immigrant protests — essentially bringing 
agriculture into the mainstream push for 
labor rights. He also halted the growth 
of Pacific Gas and Electric, forcing the 
power mogul to run energy-saving cam-
paigns instead of building more plants.

Of the six remaining candidates, not 
one has a scrap of Brown’s experience — 
nor, for that matter, a fighting chance in 
Monday’s Democratic primary. Immigrant 
rights and energy conservation are still 
two of the hottest issues on the table, and 
Brown proved to us long ago that his heart 
and head are in the right place regarding 
all that which matters most.

U.S. SENATOR

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE

STEVE POIZNER O
n the surface, there is little that 
distinguishes the Republican 
Party’s two leading gubernatorial 

candidates from one another: Steve Poizner 
and Meg Whitman are both noted business 
leaders, have plenty of personal wealth to 
bolster their campaigns and have commit-
ted to slamming the other in extensive ad 
campaigns.

The priorities they’ve outlined so far 
aren’t too different, either. Both candidates 
have stated their intent to crack down on 
immigration reform, pursue tax cuts and 
reduce state spending in an effort to rem-
edy California’s ailing economy. 

But a closer examination reveals that — 
while Whitman is declaredly in support of 
many of the same fiscal proposals touted by 
Poizner — she has put almost no effort into 
fleshing out any real plans for implement-
ing and maintaining the type of budgetary 
reform needed to re-establish our state as a 
sustainable economic powerhouse. 

Poizner, on the other hand, has spent 
much of his campaign honing a well-
defined, step-by-step plan to boost internal 
revenue and cut from California’s bloated 
state bureaucracy. His most notable pro-
posal — a 10 percent across-the-board tax 
cut that would reduce personal income 
tax and state sales tax — is a bold move 

designed to stimulate individual spending 
in California’s darkest financial hour. 

Though it’s pretty shortsighted to slash 
from two of the state’s most important 
revenue sources, Poizner at least has a plan. 
The way Whitman’s running her campaign, 
there’s no telling what she might do if she 
snatches the governor’s seat.

Aside from his irrationally conserva-
tive budget proposal, Poizner shows a few 
other red flags. He’s a staunch proponent 
of harsh immigration regulations. He’s 
said he would dramatically limit access to 
public universities for illegal aliens, and 
recently declared his support for Arizona’s 
iron-fisted new immigration laws. 

Poizner has also shown himself to be 
more of a social conservative than he’d 
like the state’s left-leaning voter base to 
think, supporting California’s ongoing ban 
on gay marriage and opposing marijuana 
legalization. 

It won’t be social issues that define the 
Republican primary race, though. With the 
state economy in shambles and a legisla-
ture incapable of forging any effective solu-
tions, the candidate who comes out on top 
is going to be the one who demonstrates 
clear ideas for how to whip California back 
into shape. In that respect, Poizner is our 
man.

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE

TOM CAMPBELL

*SPECIFIC TO
SAN DIEGO COUNT Y

Tom Campbell’s strengths lie in his thoughtfulness and experi-
ence. Though his fiscally conservative 
proposals to curb federal spending 
may not make for the fastest path 
to economic recovery, we can rest 
assured that — given his academic 
and political experience — they are at 
least informed enough to transcend 
cheap bids for support.

More importantly, his surprising 
support for the right to abortion and 
gay marriage suggests he is more 
concerned with expanding social lib-
erties than pushing a moral agenda. 
He may still want to throw his weight 
behind privatized medical care and 

the construction of a physical barrier 
along California’s border with Mexico 
— overly simple suggestions to com-
plex problems — but overall, he’s less 
extreme on social issues than main 
Republican contender and former 
Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. 

Fiorina has proven quite the 
staunch conservative: She not only 
wants to keep the Guantanamo Bay 
prison in business, but is responsible 
for what is quite possibly the most 
absurd campaign attack ad of all 
time (Google “Tom Campbell wolf 
in sheep’s clothing”). We’ll stick with 
the lesser of two Republicans, thank 
you very much. 

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE

BARBARA BOXER
Now gunning for her fourth term as senator, it’s become increas-
ingly clear that Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-CA) has gotten a little too com-
fortable in her legislative high chair. 

Though she’s been a steadfast 
advocate for key progressive poli-
cies like environmental regulation, 
educational reform and the right to 
choose, she’s never been the most 
creative or dynamic state leader. Her 
careful record as senator indicates 
she’s likely to follow whatever new 
plan her Democratic counterparts 
come up with next rather than pur-
sue an issue relevant to her constitu-
ents.

Regardless, Boxer’s only oppo-
nent — Slate Magazine blogger and 
political author Robert “Mickey” 
Klaus — is a long-shot contender 
for the Democratic nomination. 
Though we feel there’s always a 
need to challenge a politician who’s 
offered little in the way of flexible or 
energetic leadership, Klaus has yet to 
demonstrate any ability to transform 
from pensive writer to swift politi-
cian. 

So, with a bit of reluctance, we 
offer our endorsement to Boxer. 
Come general-election season, no 
matter her Republican opponent, 
Boxer will be as good as it gets.

OPINION� TUESDAY, JUNE 1, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

YES ON PROPOSITION 13
This has been a particularly lethal year in earthquake history — 
and our famously fault-lined state 
should take heed. 

That’s why Proposition 13 — 
probably the least contentious mea-
sure on the ballot — is both timely 
and necessary. Currently, after a 
building is renovated for seismic 
safety, its property value (and tax) 
can be reassessed after 15 years. 
Though lawmakers may exempt 
certain buildings from this time 
limit to encourage property owners 
to sure up their structures, those 
renovators who are not exempt still 
face a spike in property taxes once 
the 15-year limit is up. 

Prop. 13 would eliminate all 
time limits, so that renovations 
relating to earthquake safety would 
only affect a building’s property 
value after it has changed owner-
ship. Most importantly, it would 
encourage property owners to 
make their buildings more earth-
quake resistant. If you want to slim 
your chances of being caught in 
a dilapidated brick building next 
time the floor starts trembling, vote 
‘Yes’ on 13. It’s only a matter of time 
before the big one hits.

I t’s no secret: Special interests command California’s electoral 
system. Outside campaign contri-
butions of up to $600 million make 
most politicians into the servants 
of powerful unions and corpora-
tions — rather than the voters who 
place them in office. 

Proposition 15 is a small step 
toward eliminating this all-powerful 
and abusive system. The measure 
would strike down California’s ban 
on public financing of elections, 
instead starting up a pilot program 
to offer funds to candidates running 
for secretary of state, and eventually 
other offices, if things work out.

Best of all, the funds would be 
raised by charging Capitol lobby-
ists — not taxpayers themselves 
— additional fees for their exploits. 
Though it is a tentative move toward 
making our election system a bit 
more honest — and still limited to 
just one office — the measure would 
offer voters a glimpse at what poli-

tics could look like once the grip of 
special interests is loosened and can-
didates are beholden to the public. 
Smaller, less wealthy hopefuls would 
at least have a fraction of a chance.

Unfortunately, the measure 
provides for little oversight on how 
the candidates could spend the 
money they receive — potentially 
allowing for improper use of pub-
lic funds. But campaign finance 
reform has to start somewhere, and 
Proposition 15 is a budge in the 
right direction.

WHAT 13 WOULD DO
Encourage property owners to make 
their buildings earthquake-resistant 
by offering them a tax break.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘YES’
The safety-first measure is the closest 
thing to a no-brainer on the 
primary ballot.

P roposition 14 is an ambitious dreamer of an initiative. It aims 
to disintegrate the crippling par-
tisanship in state politics that has 
bogged down the legislative process 
in California for far too long.  

The way our primary system 
functions, only those voters who 
are registered as Democrats or 
Republicans (or who request a ballot 
from either party in advance) are 
eligible to participate in the election 
— causing candidates to reach out 
to supporters at the most extreme 
poles, who are generally more likely 
to show up for the first round. 

Proposition 14 would change all 
that. Instead of receiving separate 
ballots, all voters — regardless of 
party affiliation — would make 
their choices on a long list of all the 
candidates. The two who received 
the most votes would advance to 
the general election.

While some proponents of 
the measure — such as Sen. Abel 
Maldonado (R-Santa Maria) — 
assert it would bring about the 

end of fractional partisan politics, 
it’s hardly that kind of definitive 
cure-all. Political allegiances won’t 
disappear anytime soon, nor will 
incessant partisan bickering.

What Proposition 14 could do, 
though, is still worth noting: The 
measure would involve more swing 
voters in the preliminary stages of 
the race, requiring politicians to 
reach out beyond their most loyal 
bases if they wish to advance. 

In the end, we support any effort 
to democratize our election system, 
regardless of any freak upset it may 
cause down the line.

SAN DIEGO  
INITIATIVES

S taunch environmental-ists might not be thrilled 
at the prospect of digging out 
another landfill, but Proposition 
A — which would allow for the 
construction of a new landfill 
and recycling center in East Otay 
Mesa — handles our waste prob-
lem as responsibly as possible. 

The state estimates that San 
Diego County will run out of 
local waste space within 20 years, 
at which point it would become 
necessary to transport our trash 
to other counties — an expensive, 
unsustainable prospect that would 
be far more wasteful than con-
structing an additional space for 
our refuse in a sparsely populated 
part of San Diego. 

It’s no wonder the San Diego chapter of the Service 
Employees International Union 
has rallied support for a Board 
of Supervisors term limit: They 
wish to throw out long-standing 
members who don’t prioritize 
union pay and benefits. But out-
side of this special interest, a term 
limit would only weigh on county 
operations.

Just look at Sacramento. 
Legislators are whisked in and 
out of office so fast, they don’t 
have time to learn from their mis-
takes — nor begin to get along. A 
similar situation on a local level 
would clog City Hall progress and 
ultimately limit voters’ freedom to 
stick with a candidate they trust.

Just like Proposition 17 — another thinly veiled piece of corporate-
interest legislation on this summer’s 
ballot — Proposition 16 represents 
capitalist interests at their ugliest. 
(Energy giant Pacific Gas and Elecric 
has thrown a reported $35 million at 
its ‘Yes’ campaign.) 

The measure would change 
the state constitution to require a 
two-thirds public vote for any local 
government to establish or expand 
another public electricity provider. 

In other words, it would cement 
PG&E’s gaping monopoly on state 
electricity into law. 

Of course, the initiative’s chief 
proponents would have you believe 
otherwise. With glossy print pro-
paganda touting the measure as 
the “Taxpayers Right to Vote Act,” 
PG&E is attempting to frame the 
initiative as a way to empower 
voters. In reality, it would create a 
stiff roadblock for competition in 
the electricity industry — thereby 
enabling companies like PG&E to 
tap customer wallets however they 
see fit. 

Not only is a two-thirds voter 
majority exceedingly hard to come 
by, but it’s also a losing battle for all 
those public electricity providers that 
are legally prohibited from contribut-
ing to the “‘No’ on 16” campaign. 

The only empowerment that 
would result from this proposition is 
that of electricity giants — more than 
enough to justify our ‘No’ vote on 
Proposition 16.

P rop. 17 is an initiative of the insurance companies, by the insurance compa-
nies and for the insurance companies. 

If passed, automobile insurers will 
rake in profit by raising rates for custom-
ers who haven’t had continuous coverage 
for the past five years. It doesn’t matter if 
you have a perfect driving record, and it 
doesn’t matter why you were uninsured. 
Canceled to serve in the military? Higher 
rates. Canceled after being laid off? 
Higher rates. 

What if you’ve never been insured 
because you’re a carless college student? 
You guessed it: higher rates. 

The proposition is sponsored by 
Mercury Insurance, who tried to pass a 
similar initiative before — and illegally 
surcharged its customers based on their 
previous history until ordered to stop in 
2005. 

Mercury emphasizes that Proposition 
17 would benefit the 80 percent of drivers 
who switch insurance carriers by saving 
them the $250 surcharge required of new 
customers. The proposition’s fine print, 
however, reveals that Mercury intends to 
balance out the money consumers save — 
and then some — by raising premiums for 
everyone else. Sparing a one-time charge 
for the fortunate many isn’t very valuable 
when the bottom 20 percent happens to 
be financing those savings. 

What’s more, the California 
Department of Insurance estimates that if 
this measure passes, the amount of unin-
sured drivers will increase by 20 percent. 
And if more people drive uninsured, the 
cost of insurance rises for everyone else. 
In the end, the only real winners here are 
insurance companies — and that’s where 
we call bullshit.

WHAT 14 WOULD DO
Eliminate two-party primary elec-
tions by introducing an all-inclusive 
ballot; only the top two candidates 
would advance.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘YES’
It’s an admirable step toward 
making the primary system a little 
more democratic.

WHAT 15 WOULD DO
Provide provisional public funding 
to state campaigns and levy an 
additional fee on lobbyist funding.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘YES’
Candidates without financial
backing from special-interest 
groups might finally have a chance 
at a campaign.

WHAT 16 WOULD DO
Require approval by two-thirds of 
voters for a local government to use 
public funds to expand or create 
municipal  utilities.

WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE ‘NO’
This is special-interest electioneering 
at its ugliest.

Laren Poole has had a busy week. The 28-year-old San Diego native — and former UCSD student — spent last Tuesday in the Oval Office, celebrating the passage of a bill that could end the war in Uganda with President Obama. Three days later, Poole 
took off to Africa, where he will spend the next two weeks installing 
short-wave radio towers in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the 
Congo — currently a volatile war zone. 

Luckily for the graduating class of 2010, he’ll get back just in time for a 
keynote speech at UCSD’s All-Campus Graduation Celebration. 

Ironically, it will be his first graduation. Poole dropped out of UCSD in 
2004 to run non-profit organization Invisible Children full time. In 2003, 
he skipped Spring Quarter to travel to Sudan with friends Bobby Bailey 
and Jason Russell. After discovering hordes of children hiding from a 
guerilla army in Northern Uganda, the three adventurers pulled out their

CLUBHOPPING

You’ve met them before — on Library Walk, in class, outside Geisel. You lock eyes with them for a split second, recognizing the clip-board and bright student-org shirt. Before you can escape, they 
say the dreaded words: “Have you pledged CALPIRG?” In other words, 
“Would you like another $5 line item on your quarterly eBill?”

But winning over student donors isn’t the hardest part of their job. 
Since 1975, with the help of professional lobbyists and attorneys, the 
California Student Public Interest Research Group has undertaken causes 
ranging from healthcare reform to hunger and homelessness. They 
petition lawmakers, protest at public events, lobby in Sacramento and 
Washington DC, write letters and make phone calls to elected officials, as 
well as raise awareness in the more immediate community.

CALPIRG is an offshoot of U.S. PERG, and has student charters at 
all the UC campuses except for UC Merced, as well as at USC and Santa 
Monica Community College. All the student charters hold a joint confer-
ence every quarter, where they discuss current events, brainstorm cam-
paign strategies and prioritize which issues to focus on for the coming 
three months. Any student can attend, but only the executive committee 
— composed of a chair, vice chair, secretary, treasurer and a few repre-
sentatives, elected by student members of CALPIRG — has voting power.

As with any such large-scale organization, the hot topic of the night 
is always the budget. This Spring Quarter, the bulk of CALPIRG income 
will go toward a campaign for affordable education; in fall, it will mostly 
go toward a campaign for global warming solutions. According to 
CALPIRG executives, 20 percent of their funding comes from grants

W hen I was promoted to news editor in Winter Quarter, I lived in a cramped triple, 
spent mealtimes cursing the dining-
hall grub for tasting like cardboard 
and had never even been to a Sun God 
Festival. In other words, I was a fresh-
man — but damned if I would give 
anyone reason to remember it.

Nine months ago, I first climbed 
the stairs to the second floor of the old 
Student Center 
and offered a 
writer’s applica-
tion (or four) to 
Editor in Chief 
Simone Wilson. 
It was the first 
step in what I 
thought would 
be a four-year plan to achieve editor-
ship. Past incoming-editor soapboxes 
are mostly variations of “I joined on a 
whim — never intending to be editor 
— it just happened.” I’m an exception.

 Still, I never intended for it to hap-
pen this quickly. Nor did I imagine 
becoming such a loser that the lights of 
my life were stalking the A.S. listserv, 
or landing upon the perfect headline. 
That said, looking back, all the signs 
of my accelerated transformation were 
there. 

Only three weeks into Fall Quarter, 
I made a decision that signifies a 
point of no return in the Guardian. I 
removed my mom from the T-Mobile 
Fave Five.

I know, I know. It’s pathetic enough 
to have your mom as one of your Fave 
Five to begin with. But it’s even worse 
when you replace her with the A.S. 
president (at the time, Utsav Gupta), 
who you’re calling at least three times 
a week. 

That was only the beginning. I had 
dreams about murdering A.S. council 
members who didn’t call me back. On 
an all-staff Las Vegas trip, I crawled 
into a corner at 6:30 a.m. — stepping 
over various passed-out co-workers 

— to conduct an interview and write 
a story about certain dance patterns in 
honeybees. I took on so many stories 
that, at times, my byline had a near 
monopoly on the front page.

I spent so little time in my dorm 
that a housemate started an “Angela 
sighting” program, where he’d track 
the number of times he saw me during 
any given month (four was the record). 
I skipped a midterm to cover a sit-in 

in the Chancellor’s 
Complex. I spent 
finals week going 
through six years of 
archives, reading and 
documenting every 
single article into a 
90-page binder — all 
in the name of insti-

tutional memory.
Three quarters, 70-plus articles, one 

4,000-word epic and a glorious slosh-
ball victory later, I’ve had the best year 
of my life. 

But, for all that, the reality is that in 
nine months, I’ve gone from a nobody 
writer to next year’s editor in chief — 
meaning I’m still sort of worried about 
everything I know I don’t know.

It’s not just me. Our executive 
board next year will be exception-
ally young — I’m looking at you, 
Arielle and Cheryl (fellow freshmen 
who have already entered the plan-
ning stages of Project Recruit Older 
Staffers to Buy Booze). And every 
time we want to turn to Simone for 
a tease or Alyssa for a witty opinion 
headline, that’s going to be a disad-
vantage. 

However, as hard as it’s going to 
be next year, our inexperience might 
also be an advantage. We’ll get that 
much better that much quicker, all the 
while knowing we’re all in it together 
(Unless someone quits. Then I’ll 
have a new target for my murderous 
dreams.)

Next year, I’ll still love the blood, 
sweat and AP style that goes into 

every issue. But the rest of this space 
is reserved for Simone’s telltale cough, 
Reza’s office pranks and everyone who 
made my first year of college amazing. 

Simone, I could wax poetic on 
how I have never respected anyone as 
much as I respect you, but I’ll convey 
my awe by saying that I still distinctly 
remember the one time you rolled 
your eyes at me during production. (I 
put up my “I will work harder” check-
list the next day.) Reza and Alyssa: 
You’ve taught me some of the most 
basic tenets of Guardian life, from the 
importance of white space to a sacred 
duty to save the back-room couch. 
Emily: Though you may deny it, I 
know that if Guardian was a sorority, 
you’d be my “big” — during too many 
hours together in the office, you’ve 
taught me the most this year, despite 
never uttering a word about content. 
Kelsey: Your emergency edits and 
yogurt donations saved me during 
many a production. Jenna and Pecot: 
Thanks for keeping Hiatus alive, and 
letting me reserve album reviews 
ahead of time. Croskey: Your suited-
up presence in the office was always 
a positive one, and I’ll never forget 
your desert-oasis speech. Edwin: 
You’ll always have a special place in 
my heart for being the first (and only) 
editor to call me back, and reintro-
ducing me to good ‘n’ nasty hip-hop 
in your DJ Gonzo sessions. Vishal: 
Your goofiness and love of athlet-
ics has given me a newfound love of 
sports — and now I finally know the 
definition of “sac fly.” You also taught 
me how to fend off predators. And I 
forgive you for Vegas. I really do. 

This kind of makes me sound like 
a loser, but I have never loved any-
thing as much as I love working for 
the Guardian — and it’s a love I hope 
never goes away. Incoming editors of 
2010-11: We have a lot of living up 
to do, so here’s to what I hope will 
be one of the most demanding and 
rewarding years of our lives.

Beginning this summer, as required by law, UCSD will be changing to the 
Federal Direct Loan Program for Stafford, parent PLUS, and Grad PLUS Loans.

Instructions about what you need to do will be included with 
your 2010-11 Financial Aid Award Checklist on TritonLink. 

Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce 2010–2011

UCSD IS CHANGING

All current and new borrowers (students and parents) 

will need to sign a new Master Promissory Note 

for the Direct Loan program funds.

hi-def handycams to film “Invisible Children: 
The Rough Cut.” 

The documentary gained international 
attention in 2006, shedding light on the rebel 
army’s practice of abducting of child soldiers. 
At that point, finishing his degree wasn’t 
exactly the top of Poole’s to-do list. Instead, 
he shifted his attention to promoting awareness 
through a successful nonprofit organization, and 
facilitating an end to the conflict in Northern 
Uganda.

 “I’m kind of playing it by ear,” Poole said. “If 
we stop this war, then I’m going to re-evaluate 
where my life goes next.”

The rebels, who call themselves the Lord’s 
Resistance Army and advocate the overthrow 
of the Ugandan government, are led by gue-
rilla fighter Joseph Kony. The army has been 
operating out of Northern Uganda since 
1987.

In an attempt to build the army, LRA 
members — including children who have 
already been abducted and brainwashed — 
steal other children from their homes, force 
them to commit murder and convert them 
into soldiers. Often, the abductees’ first 
victims are their own parents — a strategy 
employed by the LRA so that the children 
will have no family to which they can return. 

In order to avoid this fate, thousands of 
children swarm into less isolated cities every 
night, sleeping in public places with only a 
thin mat to protect them from the bus-sta-
tion and hospital floors beneath them. When 
Poole, Bailey and Russell stumbled across one 
such scene, they began to document what 
they soon realized was a virtually un-talked-
about issue outside of the area.

The original “Invisible Children” has since 
evolved into its own nonprofit organization, 
which has held over 5,000 (and counting) 
film screenings at colleges and high schools 
around the country. They also provide aid 
— like microfinance opportunities and schol-
arships — to help improve education and 
income rates in Uganda. Not bad for a boy 
from La Mesa who started out making skate-
board videos in his backyard.

Poole said he was not expecting to return 
home from his 2003 Africa adventure with 
such a gruesome story to tell. 

“I didn’t really volunteer, or anything,” 
Poole said. “I was just going on this crazy 
adventure to South Africa to shoot some 
kind of film — I didn’t know what. Very, very 
humble beginnings. When I tell people, they 
expect me to say that, like, I wanted to be like 
Mother Theresa or something. And I was far 
from Mother Theresa.”

Prior to his somewhat spontaneous trip 
to Sudan, Poole’s only journey outside the 
country had been a family spearfishing trip 
to Mexico, and the decision to head to Africa 
came as something of an accident. While 
working for Jedediah Clothing Company, 
Poole was commissioned to put on a promo-
tional parade for the fashion company’s fall 
line. When short notice and a lack of funding 
got the better of Poole’s patience, he yelled 
at his boss — soon-to-be fellow filmmaker 
Russell — for assigning him to a project 
doomed to failure. 

“I had a horrible attitude about the whole sit-
uation,” Poole said. “So, I called two weeks after 
and apologized about my attitude and he said, 
‘Do you want to grab coffee?’ And I said ‘Sure.’ 
So Jason and I had coffee, and he said, ‘Oh, I’m 
going to Africa, if you want to come?’”

Initially, Poole refused. As the first in his 
family to go to college, he had only two years 
left before he could receive a degree in struc-
tural engineering. He knew that skipping Spring 
Quarter of his sophomore year to run away to 
Africa would not sit well with his parents — not 
just because it would put him behind academi-
cally, but because exploring Sudan would be no 
walk in the park. 

“My mom told me ‘No way,’ and she started 
crying,” Poole said. “And my dad, who was in 
Vietnam, just told me, ‘No way; you’re not going 
to someplace like Vietnam where they hate 
Americans.’ From the outside, for my parents, 
[Africa] looks like a huge hotbed of conflict. 
They were really, really scared for me.”

With a tough decision on his hands, Poole 
said he turned to god for an answer. 

“I told my mom, ‘I just need a sign from god, 
Mom. I need a sign from god,”’ Poole said. “A 
couple weeks pretty much affirmed that I wasn’t 
going to go, because I didn’t receive a sign from 
god. I just told the guys: ‘Hey, I don’t know. I’m 
just not going to make a decision. Unless some-
thing instrumental happens in my life, I’m not 

going.’”
Russell and Bailey, however, decided to take 

matters into their own hands. One morning, 
months before the intended date of departure, 
Poole woke up to a very literal calling. 

“I got up and my car was parked outside of 
my house, and there’s a huge black plywood 
sign on my window that said ‘Go,’” Poole said. 
“They had broken into my car, and in there 
was a little envelope inside. It said: ‘This is 
the sign. You’d better go.’ My mom started 
crying immediately, because she saw my face 
and she knew I had made up my mind to go 
right there. They still haven’t told me how they 
broke into my car.”

The trio set off on March 20, 2003 — the 
same day, coincidentally, the Iraq War officially 
began. They intended to spend a couple months 
filming the effects of the civil war in Sudan, after 
flying into Kenya and crossing the border how-
ever they could.

However, they soon discovered that most of 
the Southern Sudanese people had fled across 
the border to Uganda — so, after a few days of 
filming shrubs and fighting snakes, Poole, Bailey 
and Russell made their way south. A woman 
named Jolly Okot took on the role of guide, driv-
ing them to the town of Gulu — where they first 
spotted hundreds of children sleeping in a bus 
park — and helping them befriend some of the 
boys there.

When Poole got back, he was 60 pounds 
lighter (due to a bad case of malaria) but more 
than ready to piece together the hours of footage 
he’d collected. In the end, though, it took them 
an entire year complete the documentary. 

“I was trying to tell people about this experi-
ence, but it wasn’t doing it justice,” Poole said. 
“People just didn’t understand it. I didn’t blame 
them; it sounds like a nightmare. So then, after 
a year, they got to see what I’d seen and what I’d 
experienced. That was really important for me: 
for them to know why I’d changed, and why I’ve 
committed my life to it.”

Poole left UCSD at the end of his junior year 
to devote his time to Invisible Children, which 
aids African communities in their fight against 
the LRA. Since his original trip to Africa, Poole 
has returned over 20 times in hopes of captur-
ing all untold stories that might remain. His 
current focus is on recent LRA activity in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, where vil-

lagers in the northeast have seen daily attacks for 
the past three months.

“When you flip on the news, you don’t get 
any kind of compelling stories from the rest 
of the world,” Poole said. “Hollywood doesn’t 
focus on it. Your everyday, average American 
— the only thing they hear about the rest 
of the world is a guilt trip asking them for 
money. There are some really amazing things 
going on, and these are really powerful sto-
ries about tragedy and people overcoming all 
kinds of odds. I would love to find a way for 
those kinds of stories to meet mainstream 
culture.”

A followup to “Invisible Children: The 
Rough Cut” is currently in the works. The 
feature-length film, which they hope to release 
within the year, will combine footage from the 
original excursion with new material shot at pro-
tests and return trips. It will also add a new focus 
on the personal development of Poole, Bailey 
and Russell during their travels.

In fact, Poole said his decision to accept the 
invitation to speak at graduation was partly 
inspired by the personal reflection he did while 
putting the film together. 

“When you’re writing your own story, you 
kind of reflect on the decisions of the past,” 
Poole said. “Leaving school was one of the 
hardest, biggest decisions of my life, so when I 
was called by UCSD to come speak, it just felt 
right — coming back and sharing what I’ve been 
doing for the last seven years.” 

That doesn’t mean he’s planning on complet-
ing his degree anytime soon. The structural-
engineering major — chosen in part by Poole’s 
father, mostly for its profitability — no longer fits 
into his identity as a humanitarian worker. For 
now, he said, the war comes first.

“I know a lot of these kids are scared 
about getting a job, and they’re wondering, 
‘What am I going to be now?’” Poole said. 
“We need them to create their own path. We 
don’t need them to go work in these huge 
bureaucratic institutions; we need new insti-
tutions, we need new ideas, new companies. 
I want to share that message of how it’s hard 
— I’ve been there — but ultimately, it’s more 
rewarding. This world needs trailblazers.”

and outside foundations, while 80 
percent is raised through the pledge 
system — in which CALPIRG vol-
unteers ask student passersby to fill 
out a pledge card that adds $5 to 
their quarterly bill on Tritonlink. 

“They know us as the people with 
the orange stickers, and they think 
that’s all we do — ask for money — 
but we get results,” Warren College 
senior and CALPIRG Vice Chair 
Tania Herrera said.

The pledge system was instated 
in the late 1970s, after CALPIRG 
condemned various companies 
responsible for chemical spills — 
companies in which some mem-
bers of the UC Board of Regents 
had stake. The regents decided 
CALPIRG could remain on UC 
campuses if they could convince 20 
percent of the student population 
to pledge under contract every year. 
Although CALPIRG-hired campus 
organizer Adam Gosney declined 
to comment, Herrera approximated 
that 5,000 UCSD students pledge 
CALPIRG, generating roughly 
75,000 dollars a year. (On average, 
30,000 students pledge yearly on a 
statewide level.)

Another $18,750 is raised 
through grants and outside founda-
tions — totaling 93,750 a year. 

UCSD’s charter divides its bud-
get so that 30 to 40 percent pays 
Gosney’s salary. About 55 percent 
is used to hire professional staff — 
lawyers, lobbyists, scientists and 
advocates — to pressure lawmak-
ers and special interest groups. A 
remaining 5 percent goes toward 
overhead costs like rent and mate-
rials. Students work for free — as 
volunteers or interns.

 “What makes us different from 
other groups — and what makes 
us so effective — is that we have 
professional staff working full 
time,” said Tiffany Rezvani, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College freshman and 
media coordinator for CALPIRG’s 
affordable education campaign dur-
ing Winter Quarter 2010.

In addition to the professional 
staff, funds also go to purchasing 
office space and materials like stick-
ers and T-shirts.

When they aren’t fundraising, 
most CALPIRG student volunteers 
spend their time raising aware-
ness on campus. Eight different 
campaigns are currently underway, 
including the Textbooks Campaign 

— which shoots to make textbooks 
available for free on the web — and 
the Public Transit Campaign, a push 
for more state funding toward public 
transit and completion of the UCSD 
trolley extension. 

UCSD student-volunteers trav-
eled to the Los Angeles Courthouse 
last October to make La Jolla Shores 
a protected marine area — a mea-
sure that a California State Panel 
passed the next month. In addi-
tion, in light of recent fee increases, 
these same volunteers have been 
approaching candidates for the 
upcoming California governor’s 
race at public forums, pressuring 
them at the podium to make con-
crete statements on their plans for 
keeping public education affordable. 

“We’re out there giving stu-

dents opportunities to act in that 
moment,” Herrera said. “Whether 
it’s signing petitions — whether 
it’s making calls, writing a story or 
volunteering — it’s on-the-spot kind 
of stuff. If you see us, we’re up to 
something you can get involved in 
right there and then.”

In CALPIRG’s quarterly intern-
ship program students commit 
about 10 hours a week in exchange 
for four course credits. There are 
also numerous short-term volunteer 
positions available. Everyone is wel-
come at general body meetings, held 
Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in Room 203 
of the Student Center. Visit www.
calpirgstudents.org/ucsd for more 
information.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� TUESDAY, JUNE 1, 2010� NEWS

University Center administrators to present 
financial records if they continue negotiating 
the reduction of their rent. Representatives 
from the co-ops are currently in the process of 
renewing their space agreements with the uni-
versity, which will dictate the terms of main-
taining their Student Center locations.

This is not the first time the co-ops have 
gone to the council in desper-
ate times. Last year, co-op rep-
resentatives asked the council to 
carry about a $30,000 debt; their 
request was granted. 

In April, the co-ops asked 
University Centers to lift their 
obligation to pay rent com-
pletely. However, administrators 
declined to consider the request 
without the presence of docu-
ments detailing the expenses and 
the income of the co-ops. 

In response, General Store 
employee Andrew Rubens,  along 
with about 15 other co-op repre-
sentatives, visited the council ‘s 
meeting on May 26 to submit the 
request for $15,500 — enough 
to hire an accountant to prepare 
the needed documents. Associate 
Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Jordan Taylor sponsored 
the request.

“We wanted there to be a face to this propo-
sition of thousands of dollars being taken from 
A.S.,” Rubens said. “We explained why we 
thought it was necessary.”

Rubens added that the co-ops will not make 
a habit of turning to the council for help.

“We’re not going to be asking for money in 
the future,” he said. “This is a one-time thing, 
to help with the process of certifying our rent 
agreement and making it smoother.”

According to Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang, the $5,167 will come 
from mandate reserves — where approximately 
$900,000 is set aside for one-time expenses and 
enterprise startups.

University Centers and the co-ops will each 
pay $5,167 to cover the full $15,500 cost of an 
accountant. This amount was determined in 

a discussion between director of University 
Centers Paul Terzino and a local accounting 
firm.

Once the University Centers Advisory 
Board receives the financial statements — 
beginning in 2007 for the General Store and 
Groundwork Books, and 2008 for the Food 
Co-Op — it will review the documents and 
determine each co-ops’ need for a rent reduc-

tion. UCAB will examine how much 
each co-op can afford and how 
much the university is willing to 
subsidize.

Under an expired lease agree-
ments still in place on a month-
to-month basis, rent is currently 
$1,450.97 for the G-Store, $521.70 
for the Food Co-Op and $788.55 
for Groundwork Books.

UCAB Chair Nicole Metildi 
said she is sure University Centers 
will try to make it easier for the 
co-ops to pay rent. As an alterna-
tive, UCAB is considering swap-
ping the General Store space with 
UCSD Bike Shop’s smaller space 
so that the General Store can pay 
less in rent.

“We talked about ways we can 
help them to better pay their rent, 
and we also talked about the co-
ops really defining who they are,” 

Metildi said.
Taylor, who was 2009-10 UCAB Chair, said 

the co-ops could benefit from redefining them-
selves as student services, rather than vendors.

“What will probably be written into the 
new space agreement is a paragraph where [the 
co-ops] describe what they feel they are — and 
what fully encompasses — their operations as 
more than just a vendor [but also] a safe place 
on campus [and] as a resource of social move-
ment,” Taylor said.

At a meeting with University Centers in 
April, the co-ops stated that they don’t regard 
themselves to be for-profit vendors.

“They still have to pay some sort of rent 
because they’re selling stuff,” Metildi said.

Members of the the co-ops are asking the 
A.S. Council, GSA and UCAB every quarter to 
touch base. According to Taylor, they also plan 

to create a public annual report that includes 
the financial expenses and current business 
models being used.

Metildi said she plans to meet with mem-
bers of the co-ops over summer to further dis-
cuss a potential master space agreement should 
be finalized by the end of Fall Quarter, at which 

point the GSA and the A.S. Council will give 
a final OK since they represent graduate and 
undergraduate students who pay the university 
centers fee.

some very uncharacteristic mis-
takes,” head Coach Dan O’Brien 
said in an interview with the 
UCSD Athletic Department. 

The Tritons opened the week-
long tournament against Georgia 
College & State University, emerg-
ing with a 3-2 victory thanks to 
a walk-off single by junior Grant 
Bauer. Junior Tim Shibuya threw 
his fifth complete game of the sea-
son, striking out four to record his 
twelfth victory.

Late-inning drama followed the 
Tritons into their next game of the 
tournament — this time against 
University of Central Missouri. 
Senior righty Matt Rossman took 
a no-hitter into the eighth before 
allowing two straight doubles and 
giving up a run. With a 1-1 tie, the 
game went into extra innings — and 
Rossman rose to the task. He did 
not allow a hit the rest of the way, 
and junior catcher Kellen Lee drove 
in the winning run in the top of the 
11th to capture a 2-1 victory.

In the semifinal game against 
Franklin Peirce University, junior 
pitcher Guido Knudson threw four 
and two-thirds innings of score-
less baseball. Junior third baseman 
Evan Kehoe’s three RBIs led the 
offense, as the lineup combined 
for 13 hits and six runs in 6–3 win 
that led the Tritons into the cham-
pionship game.

After recording seven straight 
victories in postseason play, the 
Tritons were in the driver’s seat 
of the double-elimination College 
World Series — having advanced 
through the bracket without a 
single loss.

Staff ace Shibuya was given the 
nod in the championship game. 
However, the ever-reliable junior 
out of Wyoming wasn’t as sharp 
as he had been throughout the 
season, yielding five runs in four 
innings.

Still, the Tritons came out 
strong at the plate after a home run 
off the bat of junior outfielder Kyle 
Saul and an RBI double by Kehoe. 
But the 2–0 lead was short-lived: 
UCSD found itself in a hole after 
Southern Indiana answered back 
with a three-run second inning. 
Two throwing errors allowed three 
unearned runs for USI, and the 
Tritons trailed 3-2. 

Rossman, coming off a bril-
liant performance against Central 

Missouri just 
days before, 
entered 
the game 
to relieve 
Shibuya. 
However, 
Rossman 
showed signs 
of fatigue 
and exited 
after allow-
ing a hit and 
a walk and 
recording 
just two outs. 
Knudson 
came in to 
quiet the 
USI bats, 
but couldn’t 

quite gain control over the 
Screaming Eagles, who extended 
their lead to 6–2.

Though the Tritons rallied in the 
eighth inning with RBIs from red-
shirt freshman Danny Susdorf and 
junior Blake Tagmyer, two quick 
fly outs in the bottom of the ninth 
saw the Tritons down to their final 
out. Kehoe singled to put the tying 
run at the plate, but another fly ball 
sealed the game and handed the 
national title to Southern Indiana.

Senior first baseman Brandon 
Gregorich went three-for-five, 
Kehoe had two hits and drove in a 
run and Saul homered for UCSD 
in the loss. 

They may not have gotten their 
fairytale ending, but the Tritons 
played championship-caliber base-
ball all season, winning 20 of their 
last 22 games in 2010 and finishing 
their season with an overall record 
of 54-8 — the most wins and few-
est losses the UCSD baseball team 
has ever seen in a single season.

“We all recognize that this is 
the greatest season in the history 
of UCSD baseball,” senior pitcher 
Kirby St. John said. “Right now 
it really stings, but the more time 
goes by the more we realize how 
special it was of what we were able 
to accomplish.”

O’Brien said he was pleased 
with his team despite the loss. 

 “Our guys did exactly what 
they needed to do and battled to 
the very end,” O’Brien said. “They 
stayed resilient, they stayed loose 
— we just didn’t get it done. I can’t 
tell you how proud I am of this ball 
club for how they go about their 
business day in and day out.”

Of the eight teams invited to 
the College World Series, UCSD 
was the only team that had played 
in the 2009 tournament. And, with 
only nine graduating seniors, the 
team will set its sights on Cary, 
N.C, for the third straight season.

The loss hurts most for the 
seniors, but St. John said how 
grateful he was for the experience.

“This team is really special.” 
St. John said. “We love hanging 
around together and have a lot of 
team chemistry, and that’s the most 
important thing to take out of it.” 

Rossman echoed St. John’s sen-
timents.

“It was an awesome run,” 
Rossman said. “An amazing year 
with an even better group of peo-
ple. It was definitely the best year 
of my life.”

Head women’s coach Darcy Ahner 
said Fogarty impressed her all season. 

“You think everyone has off-days, 
but this year, Kelly was just on all the 
time,” Ahner said. 

Though Merrill set yet another 
school record in the 400-meter hurdles, 
she was unable to reclaim her title as 
national champion in the event, which 
she won in 2009. Her time of 58.03, 
however, is the fastest in UCSD his-
tory — nearly a half-second faster than 
her winning time at the 2009 national 
championships in San Angelo, Texas. 

Sophomore Jacqueline Rose and 
junior Stephanie LeFever joined Merrill 
and Fogarty on the 1600-meter relay 
team, earning an eighth-place finish 
and garnerimg All-American honors. 
Their time of 3:44.39 is the second fast-
est school history.

“That was probably the most nerve-
racking race I’ve ever been in,” Fogarty 
said. “It was a totally different field than 
what we’re used to, but we still got a 
[season best].”

Senior Donna LeFever cleared 
12’2.75” in the pole vault, placing sixth 
in the event. The elder LeFever sister 
came into the meet ranked 10th, but 
cleared the mark on her first attempt to 
move up in the final standings. 

Although she came into the cham-
pionship meet ranked first in the high 

jump, senior Linda Rainwater’s frac-
tured back impeded her from defend-
ing the national title. Rainwater was 
given medical clearance only days 
before the meet, but still found herself 
in pain during each attempt. Still, her 
resilience allowed her to finish with a 
jump of 5’5.75” — good for 11th place.

“She did what she could,” Ahner 
said. “It wasn’t where she was before 
the injury, but she did what she could 
and was just a few places off of All-
American. She’s a gutsy, strong woman.”

Fellow senior high jumper Casey 
Ryan also battled a nagging injury to 
place ninth with a mark of 6’9.50”. 
Other top accomplishments included 
Senior Daniel Anderson’s 14th place 
1:51.97 finish in the 800-meter race, 
and junior Theresa Richards’ ninth-
place 140’4” mark in the javelin throw. 

Salerno said he was happy with the 
team’s performance, especially given 
the caliber of competition at the meet.

“The level in Division-II has 
improved dramatically in the last five 
years,” Salerno said. “There’s going to 
be places it doesn’t go well, but the level 
is just so high. I don’t think we had any 
disappointments. We’re coming back 
with nine All-Americans, and that’s 
really impressive.”

I t may not have been the last of the day, but sopho-more Nick Howe’s championship throw immedi-ately looked like a winner. With the javelin stuck in the grass 225 feet from where he stood, Howe knew no competitor would come close to beating 
his mark. It was only a matter of time before he was named 
national champion.

At the 2010 Division-II track and field championships 
on May 30, Howe’s accomplishment led a formidable Triton 
showing over the next three days in Charlotte, N.C. With 
his victory in the javelin throw, Howe became the first male 
national champion in the history of UCSD track and field. 

“He really performed like someone beyond his years,” 
head coach Tony Salerno said. “He had a rough first throw, 
came back, made adjustments and made the big throw he 
needed to win.”

Howe won the event by nearly six feet — a personal best 
and new school record.

But Howe wasn’t the only one to end the season with 
success. Six Tritons earned All-American honors at the 
meet, awarded to the top eight athletes in each event. Two 
were even named All-Americans in multiple events: Junior 
Kelly Fogarty and Senior Christine Merrill. 

Fogarty placed in the top eight in three of her four 
events, becoming the first Triton sprinter to earn All-
American honors in both the 100- and 200- meter races. 
Her time of 11.99 seconds in the 100 earned her sixth 
place, while 24.04 seconds in the 200 was good for sev-
enth. Lincoln University’s Semoy Hackett, who represented 
Trinidad and Tobago at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, won 
both events. 

“I’m still in awe, and it still hasn’t really hit me,” Fogarty 
said. “It’s really an honor. “[My coach] has really believed in 
me the whole time, so it’s nice to have the unwavering faith 
that I can do it.”
