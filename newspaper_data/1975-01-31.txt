Fekrat Covers Oil, OPEC, Advances in Iran 

by P~tti Wolf 

Iran's non-alliance with the 
Arabian countries of the Middle 
East, her opposition to the u'se 
of oil as a political weapon and 
her policies of supplying oil to 
Israel and assisting oil-podr third 
world nations were the topics 

Amin Fekrat 

di cus ed Tuesday night by Dr. 
Amin r edrat, personal envoy to 
the Imp rial Household of Iran 
and Dr Irving Kaplan, a memb r 
of the World En rgy In titute 
and Fekrat' US escort Th talk 
commenced Muir ollege' s 
Gliest-in-Residence program 

Fekrat frequently emphasized 
the independenc of Iran in her 
dealings with OPEC 
(Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting ountries) and spoke 
of Iran 's resistance to OPEC 
pressure. "We have no intention 

of following the desire of the 
Arab countries to embargo oil. 
Turning oil into a political 
weapon is not right," he said . 

Hot Issue 
Fekrat also said that Iran is 

the only Middle Eastern country 
supplying Israel with oil. 
However, he declined to state 
Iran's policy concerning the 
Middle East conflict, declaring 
that Israeli -Iranian relations are 
" a hot issue." He expressed hope 
for a ettlem nt of all hosti lities 
" for a en e of justice and for 
the sake of peace.:' 

A barrage of questions 
concerning Iran ' (and OPEC's) 
apparent plan to trangle the 
world by rai ing oi l prices was 
almly fended off by rekrat. 

"The oil pri ri e is indirect 
respon e to the ri e in world 
Inflation . We hope that the 
industrialized countries will do 
om thing about world in -

flation ," he sa id, indicating that 
when Inflation recedes, the 
price of oil will fall. 

"The Am rican public is 
misled ," r krat continued "Th 
multi-national companies are 
th real culprits ; they have 
c au d the teep ri e in the price 
of 011 There i a war going on 
b tw('en the multi -national 
corporat ions and the re t of the 
world - they are trying to buy 
th world " 

The OPE countries are 
aidirrg, not strangling, the 0 -
called third world countri s, 
ontends rekrat " Iran per-

sonally gav billions to third 

* * * 

world governments such as 
India and Pakistan . And we 
proposed plans for an in-
ternationaÂ·1 monetary fund 
solely for the purpose of aiding 
third world countries." Fekrat 
stated that through subsidized, 
long-term grants, the countries 
can " buy their oil cheap ." 

New Wealth 
Fekrat appeared more relaxed 

when speaking about the ad-
vances made by Iran with her 
new found wealth . He said the 
oil r venue has enabled Iran to 
embark on "enormous 
developmental projects" in the 
areas of technology, health, 
education, industry, agriculture 
and the economy . Jabbing 
western society, he said, "Our 
older values have becom 
dislocated, and new valu shave 
not been set . But we are con-
cious of the fact that the in-

troduction of technology do s 
not mean that we have to giv 
up our values and traditions." 

The possible depletion of 
Iran's oil supply in 20 or 30 years 
has prompted the government 
to commence exploration of 
energy alternatives "We have 
an interest in nuclear nergy 
and have exp rimented with 
olar nergy. We do not want 

the current trend (the im-
provement of Iran) to be 
rever ed ." 

Fekrat, a professor of 
psychology in Iran, is in the US 
to arrange an educational 
program wit h Georgetown 
Univer ity . 

Kenny: 'Teenage Commies from Outer Space' 
by Charles Heimler 

Doug Kenny, editor of the 
National lampoon, yesterday 
ass rted before a noontime 
gathering of UC San Diego 
tudents that President Ford is 

" to stupid to lie ." 
Kenny 's political remarks 

came during his. combined 
presentat'on of a lecture of 
"t enage commies from outer 

~ pacE'," a tand-up monologue, 
and an outline of the success of 
the ~ati rical National lampoon . 

ThE' highlight of Kenny's 
performance came when he 
IInitat!:'d a hawaiian ukulele by 
humming and breathing through

Kenny and Henry Beard 
founded NatLamp six years ago 
after working tog ther on th

Kenny confessed to the crowd 
of over 150 people on the 
tudent Center knoll that he'd 

been a wimp in high school-"you 
know, one of those guys that 
wears a tie-clip that looks like a . 
slide rule and really works." 

Another of the amazing 
talents Kenny displayed was his 
ability to hum both the bass run 
and drum riff, at the same time, 
from Creams " Sunshine of Your 
Love ." 

Kenny concluded his speech 
by ugge ting that the taco is 
the best symbol for California 
culture. He revealed that the 
lEtters in TACO stand f(\( " Teen-
Age ommies from Outer 
Space," and that"somehow this 

demonstrates the mystical 
unities covered in our talk 
today." 

No Letters 
During the subseOquent 

question and answer period, 
Kenny told one student that 
NatLamp doesn't print letters 
from readers " because we just 
mn' t give a shit abou't what they 
think ." 

Kenny revealed that the 
National Lampoon radio hour 
has been dropped because it 
wasn't making money. He aid 
that several advertisers have 
been lost because of thi s 
month 's religion issue .. 

Most of the funny lines had 
been cut from Kenny's recent 
appearance on Tom Snyd r'

Eden Martinez is New 
KSDT Station Manager 

Campus radio station KSDT has 
a new station manager. Eden 
Martinez is replacing John 
Mussleman who left UCSD last 
quarter. 

Martinez, a 2o-year-<>ld junior 
majoring in communications, has 
officially taken over heading the 
station after serving as a tem-
porary manager since December. 

Martinez epitomizes the new 
philosophy which has taken over 
at the station th is year A cording 
to the tat ion's executive 
management, the days of free 
form radio are gone, and are 
being replaced by a more 
professional attitude 

" What I want to develop at the 
tat ion," says Martinez, " is a 

school, a more relevant school of 
radio communications People 
will be able to achieve 
professional competency If 
they're willing to listen, be 
taught, and put in the time." 

Martinez sees his tenure as 
manager lasting until June of 
1976. By then , he hopes to see the 
tat ion obtain FCC licensing and a 

frequency on the FM non-
commercial radio band 

" The nature of KDST is a sort of 
hindrance to getting a FCC 
license," admits Martinez 

" Being a college station is two 
strikes .against us," he explains. 
" In terms of our educational and 
community function we not only 
have to match , we have to sur-
pass, professional AM and FM 
stations." 

Recently , former KSDT 
executives challenged the FCC 
renewal of La Jolla radio station 
KDIG . Martinez believes the 
denial of a license is almost 
certain and emphasizes that the 
professional development of 
KSDT is necessary to support the 
station's bid to obtain KDIC's FM 
frequency . 

" We are developing the station 
so we have a legitimate claim for 
that license," he explains. 

That development consists of 
added public affairs program-
ming, mu ical programming 
according to a playlist format, 
and improvement of engineering 
facilities . 

Martinez ardently 
philo ophical about hi role a 
stat ion manager 

" I came to U 0 to be a writer,

Revellr Controversy 

People Need Requirem.ents 
by MARk SCHUMAkER 

In YO' lr Jan . 17 issue Nick Papodoupolos wrote a letter in support of 
the genl..'I"al education requirements at Revelle College. At the end of 
Nick's letter another letter commented that whether or not the 
general education program at Revelle is good, it should not be forced 
upon anyone. In my opinion this is a very important consideration 
and so I would like to explain in some detail why I agree with Nick. 

I would like to ask, why do we have four different colleges at 
UCSD? Certainly the upper division courses are open to all students 
v.no meet the academic requirements and it is in these courses that 
most of the serious work towards a major goes on. But there is a real 
difference between the colleges when it comes to lower division 
work, which doesn't add so much to com_entrated training in a major 
field as it does to the general cultural background of a student. One 
reason why we have different colleges is so that a student can choose 
between the different programs of lower division education. 

I believe that these general education requirements can be very 
val uable for a student, and in particular that the humanities s~uence 
at Revelle has been valuable for me. I want to explain why this is 0 
and afterwards why I feel that this sequence or something simi lar to it 
hould be required. 

Useful creativity, I believe, originates in a person who finds himself 
in the midst of anxiety and doubt, in the apprehension of apparent 
paradox. A person who lives complacent with his ideas on a subject 
will not be inspired to think of anything new and will not subject new 
ideas to the constructive criticism that they need. If the new idea fits 
in with wfiat the person believes it may be complacently accepted, 
and if the new idea does not agree with pre-established beliefs it will 
be rejected without thought. This would be all right if we humans had 
atisfactory answers to all our problems but it's evident that we don't. 

Unfortunately people have a strong tendency to live with a et of 
ideas about the world without questioning them This is quite un-
derstandable since it makes I ife easier, but it also stifl es the creativi ty 
that humanity needs. One of the functions of our expensive 
university system is to destroy this complacency in people who have 
the potential to become constructively creat ive. One of the ways in 
which the university can do this is to subject them to some of the 
brilliant, persuasive, and contradictory works that can be found in 
world literature. This is one the points of the Humanities sequence. 

I can only make an example of my)elf. My first serious exposure to 
either Karl Marx or the Bible was in books which were assigned 
reading in the appropriate Humanities classes. In the same context I 

. read Goethe's Faust which is full of strong images of man struggling 
towards greatness, on the other hand I also read Pope's An Essay on 
Man, in which he stresses that man occupies a humble position in a 
great chain of being. I read and admired a little of both Kierkegaard 
and Nietzche though in some ways their world views are bitterly 
opposed. I think the Humanit ies sequence is partially responsible for 
giving me the idea that two contradictory points of view can each 
have tremendous insight. For all this I think I'm a much richer person. 

It's undeniable that sometimes Humanities lectures are a bore and 
that students are subjected to the whims of their TAs. But the lectures 
might be more interesting if peo I" kept up with the reading, and if 
those who did were a bit more aggressive with their questions. A 
professor who knows his class is trying to follow him might be in-
pired to give clear and interesting lectures. And I imagine a TA 

would be less inclined to worry about the subleties of format if 
confronted with well thought out ideas. 

But even so, what gives the university the right to force people to 
take this stuff? The answer is nothing of course, but then no one 
forces anyone to go to Revelle college. People can go somewhere 
else and receive an education towards a major that's just as strong. 
The Revelle general education requirements are clearly stated in the 
catalog and anyone who goes here should know about them, and 
those who enter in spite of th iS and afterwards decide they don't like 
those requirements have the opportunity to transfer away. Those who 
do so aren't stupid, it's just that they would rather do something with 
their time other than sitting in humanities classes. But some, like me, 
would like to gain a broader background in our culture than we had 
on leaving high school, and they may not have sufficient internal 
discipline to force themselves to complete a sequence of classes 
som of which they would inevitably fi nd boring. What such people 
need is a set of requirements which lend the psychological diSCipline 
needed to keep up. It's a trick that really works, somehow. Just as 
when : ertain people want to lose weight they go to a health spa 
where they are forced to do so. The analogy may not be very at-
tracti" .. t>ut I hope my point is clear. Anyone who doesn't want to 
enter the diSCipline doesn't have to and they houldn't b thought the 
less r for that. But some of us would like to have the opportunity 
around.

"Relayer" Relayed, 
LAWRENCE DECKEl: 

I and a number of my disciples have noticed 
what in all likelihood is a malfunction in the 
circuitry of your hearing mechanism (it's well -
known fact that activities at SCUD can cause 
severe strain for critical areas of one's 
physiological machinery, e.g., hearing loss) . We 
urge you to consu lt your personal phySician, and 
have him check your ears- at the earliest 
possible onvenience. 

We urge this recommendation on account of 
the obvious symtamatology. Your music review of 
the album, "Relayer" (Yes), has gross ly infuriated 
a significant number of the militant hosts of 
Legion, darling Regan included (triste dictu). It is 
singularly stunning that all your. negat ive com-
ments about "Relayer" actually apply to the 
album, "Tales From Topographic Oceans," which 
though not a bad album. lapses into soporific 
oceans on side one, two and four- if Yes had 
edited clown " Tales, " to just side three. whi ch 
features Steve Howe's brilliant acoustic guitar 
passages, the album would approach per-
fection . Conv rsely, all your words of praise for 
the " Tales " album really appropriate for 
"Relayer," an almost flawless and unearthly 
sound co llage, which has certainly redeemed 
Yes from the rrolasses seas of .. Tales ... .. Is there 
the remotest possibility that you have 
somehow confused th e two album titles with 
one another? 

In your review you used the expression, 
"progressive muzak"-well . I pray that you realize 
it's a blessing from the Prince of Darkness Himself, 
that Mr. Wakeman has departed from Yes, if the 
pedestrian dentist office rock of his "Journey To 
The Center Of The Earth" is any indication of 
things to come. However. Legion is merciful, and 
Mr. Wak man can re-enter the ranks of the 
militant musical host, provided he redeems 
himself on his next album ("Six Wives.. .. was a 
step down the right road.) tvIoreover, Patrick 
IvIoraz is a willing and dutiful servant-his 
diabol ically subtle keyboard efforts have en-
deared him to the Prince of Darkness. 

In any case, Mr. Deckel , you have been warned. 
Legion is always watching, Legion knows- He 
never rests; the entries in the Great Black Book are 
thorough and precise. Remember ' shoddy and 
incompetent music reviews lead the fold astray-
they contribute to divisive and maligning in-
clinations, which ultimately lead to abominations 
like St. Elton In The John, the pseudo-angelic 
Refried Beatles. and other forms of vinyl wastage. 
Do not aid and abet the enemy. TAKE HEED, 
BEFORE ITS TOO LATE.

Third Solar Energy 
Dear Mr. Gill and Mr Norberg: 

Regarding your letter to Donald Sites [Triton 
Times, January 6, 1975) concerning energy 
conservation and alternative energy lsystems in 
new construction at UCSD. you may be interested 
in learning about our efforts in Third College. 

Although Academic Unit I and Residence Halls 
Unit I of Third College are designed to be 
somewhat energy cons rving, Third College and 
the campus Architects and Engin rs Office have 
agreed to pursue th possibilities of incorporat ing 
Solar Energy Sources for heating and cooling of 
Unit II ofThird College. 

Toward this end. we are seeking to have a 
portion of Third College Academic Unit II be the 
subject of one of the workshops of the February 
American Institute of Architects conference on 
Energy Systems for Buildings. It is our hope that 
this workshop will provide us with a number of 
implement able ideas on energy conservation and 
alternative sources of energy which can be in-
corporated into some of the permanent facilities 
of Third College and other UCSD facilities. 

It should be noted. however, that the utilization 
of Solar Energy is still in the research and 
development Stage and may not be finanCially or 
physically feasible in large building projects until 
adequate ystems of storage and distribution can 
be developed. 

On April 12, Third College will hold its second 
conference on the energy crisis on the topic of 
Solar Energy. 

We would be pleased to receive any ideas or 
suggestions on energy conservation and alter-
native sources of en rgy for buildings which you 
would like to share with us.

Coalition Ignored 
Open letter to George Murphy. Vice Chancellor, 
Student Affairs : -

It has come to our attention that once again 
there is a meeting being held on Veterans Affairs 
at UCSD. The UCSD Veterans Coalition would like 
to take this opportunity to lodge a letter of protest 
at not being included in these procedings 

Perhaps you feel , as students, we have nothing 
to offer or that the decision as to what monies 
space, and personnel we need are none of ou~ 
business. 

This is not, and will not, be the case.

The Revelle Reporter An interview with UC San Diego Academic Senate chairman Avrum Stroll . 
Last November, Stroll , Stan Fields and Jonathan 

Saville began revising the first two of the six 
humantities courses in order to refocus the 
sequence on certain topi cs. Changes in the course 
structure would involve teaching methods as well 
as subject matter. For instance, T.A .s selected to 
participate in the program would be required to 
cttend an intensive sum mer training session in 
w-tich they would first be taught the material and 
later engage in teaching sessions with course 
p"ofessors acting as students. The aim of thi s format 
w:>uld be to thoroughly familiarize the TAs with 
subject matter, and with teacher expectat ions in 
particular. The subject matter itself is to be 
<nmposed primarily of classic material which 
demonstrates what Stroll calls " pervasive and 
lrliversal ideas which , on reflect ion , are highly 
germaine to any issue." The course outline shows 
freshmen beginning with the study of primitive. 
symbols and the Homeric cycles. 

Initiation of the program is dependent at p"esent 
on a planning grant from the National Endowment 
for the Humanities. 

Among the criticisms leveled at the Revelle 
Humanities sequence is its failure to address itself 
to relevant issues, and students have demonstrated 
interest in seeing the study of global systems i n-
duded as alternatives in the Humanities sequence . 
Stroll agrees that the Humanities program should 
'open options ." All aspects of the humanities . 

mables an instructor to continue along outmoded 
lines. Still, says Stroll , "We can 't interfere with an 
instructors right to teach a course the wery he want s 
That's the basis for academ ic freedom " 

Stroll was asked whether he thought additional 
options in the Revelle curriculum woultln ' t cau se i t 
to swing closer to the Muir curr iculum in format 
and intent. Stro ll didn't think so, as the Revelle 
sequence is still more highly structured . " The 
essence of scholarship," says Stroll, " is discipline, 
and one way to ach ieve that is a highly structured 
curri culum." But what about the bugaboo 
relevance? Stroll points out that the question of 
relevance is 'double-edged. There is the long and 
short-range relevance." Revelle's apparent aim has , 
so far, been the long-range sort . Because, he says, 
'The real world is forbidding . Challenge (in 
academic life) helps to overcome problems of the 
external world . It's necessary to disci pi ine yourself 
to do those things you don't really want to do " 

Still , it's difficult fora student to knew what will 
be expected of him outside the academic com -
mlflity, whether it will be the Renaissance Man or 
the Specialist who will prove to be relevant . Stroll 
' It 's hard to know what the relation betw n 
curr iculum and real life will be. But our com-
mttment to the prinCiple characteri st ics of 
Humanities should not become obsolete over-
ni~t."

1M BS . 
FeHruary Will Bring Superstars 

Joe Frazier nrarly drowned in a Superstars 
cortest two ~;ars ago . Bob Seagren beat Frazier in 
the weight-lifting event . And many other invnortal 
athletes 1IIere humiliated in such events as sprinting 
and M'invnin~ . 

Now is the time for the UCSD bookworms to 
rome out of their holes in the library and humiliate 
the intramural jocks of this campus; in a Superstars 
<Dntest, not a biology test . 

Vou wll even be able to get your friends together 
and form a team as this is Team Superstars. Five ' 
people to a team and five events . It doesn't even 
require a math major to figure out that each person 
(roe has to be of the opposite sex) will have to 
specialize in ooe event . 

The compeitition will be held on Sunday, 
February 9, beginning at 9:30 am . The first event 
~II be the free throw shooting contest, followed by 
~iw.t liftire, swimming, softball throw and 
sprinting <t 45 minute intervals. 

Prizes, in the form of gift certificates to Ginder's 
Sporting Goods of La Jolla, will be awarded to the 

~ming teams. The first place team will take home 

S75; second place will earn 555, third place 540; 
fourth place 530; fifth place; 525 . The overall 
champion in the individual competition' will earn 
himself or herself a nice 545 . 

At the suggestion of Fourth College Provost, Lea 
Rudee, the Intramural Department in conjunctioo 
wth the colleges will sponsor an Inter-College 
Tournament at the endofthe quarter . 

Each college will sponsor' an open basketball 
team and a coed \OlIeyball team to compete in the 
tournament. The tourney will be held on the last 
\\eekend of the quarter . It is hoped that the 
tournament will foster a little college spirit as well 
as ilteraction between the colleges . 

It is up to each college to determine it's 
representatives to the tournament . All participants 
must be in good academic standing, be carrying ten 
units, and not be a member of the varsity squad in 
the sport . 

The tournament will be si ngle e limination, with a 
random draw determing opening round games. 

Ruggers Tie .Santa Ana, 22-22 
Last Saturday on the Muir field , 

the men's Rugby teams tackled 
the Santa Ana rugby club and 
came out with their best per-
formance of the season . 

The men 's first team played 
Santa Ana to a 22-22 tie, after 
jumping off to an 18-4 halftime 
lead . In the second half they 
"slacked off" in their play ac-
cording to coach Peter Sertic, as 
Santa Ana rallied and jumped 
into a 22-18 lead. The ruggers 
then regained their composure to 
tie the score. 

The second team was more 
successful in their match , win-
ning 18-4. They opened th e 
scoring early in the first half and 
never looked back . The only loss 
of the afternoon came with the 
defeat of the men's third team . 
Despite the losing effort of the 
club, coach Sertic said the team 
"displayed the best passing yet 
this season ." 

On Sunday the women's team 
continued their winning ways as 
they completely dominated the 
Santa Ana team and registered an 
18-0 shutout. So far this season, 
the women's team has suffered 
only one defeat, and that came at

The team was plagued by fou 
and injuries. Three girls on the 
fir t team were benched less than 
half-way into the first half with 
four fouls each. This forced coach 
Fox to use the second string for 
most of the game. Three- other 
gir ls had to leave the game with 
injuries. One girl, Sioux Amaral , 
had to be taken from the gym on 
a stretcher with a knee injury. 

The girls passed more than they 
dribbled, and often shots were 
just thrown up 'from near the 
basket. Many of the shots looked 
like poor passes as they often 

failed to hit the rim. Play was 
ragged and disorganized . SDSU 
often capitalized on tile girls 
mistakes and turned them to their 
advantage with fast break 
baskets . The Aztecs grabbed a 
quick lead and then never looked 
back as they ran away with the 
game. 

Near the end of the game, the 
girls put together a semblance of 
an offense as they were able to 
move the ball in close enough for 
a shot ,'but they were so cold from 
the floor that their shots did not 
hit.

Hockey? , 
Marinated Ice 

by Kirll Robinson 

Last fall I Â·managed to secure a pass to the San Diego Mariners 
Hockey games. I was able to attend the opening game, but since then 
Paul and Dave, my faithful assistants, have been religiously fiid1ting 
over who gets to go to which game. All of which is hard to believe 
since the Mariners play in the World Hockey Association, a distinct 
second in quality to the Natipnal Hockey League. 

Monday I was able to wre'st the pass out of the grubby hands of one 
of the aforementioned two, deciding it was time for me to enjoy the 
fruits of my efforts . 

But being the sneaky hockey fan that he is, Dave talked me into 
taking him along as my photographer. And besides, he has a car and I 
don't. It also turned out that I had the camera and he didn 't . 

So iJNay we went . In his car, with me as the photographer. 
It took awhile for us to convince the man at the gate that wewere for 

real , but after a struggle, we were able to settle down into a couple of 
seats that Dave, the judicious hockey fan , had picked out . 

Since the Mariners were playing Winnipeg, a Canadian team, we had 
to listen to both the Star Spangled Banner and 0 Canada ! Dave tumed 
iJI'ld asked why Francis Scott Key didn 't write 0 Canada! Good 
question, Dave. 

The game, or should I say the fight, started . It should have never 
been allowed to . I didn ' t count the number of times that the referees 
had to separate players, but I am su re it was greater than the total 
number of goals scored in the game (16,nine by Winnipeg and seven 
for the Mariners) . 

AsÂ·Dave said after the game, everythi ng that ho ckey has to offer was 
offered: fights, goals, penalties, and even players rushing the crowd 
after the game. 

At one point in the third period there were so many players In the 
Mariner penalty box, that the refs started giving them seats in the 
reserved section . There were penalties for fighting , spearing, slashing 
iJI'ld even throwing a towel onto the ice. 

Wimipeg managed to take advantage of the times that people were 
in the penalty box, scoring four power play goals and scoring once 
w,ile shorthanded. Pick on 'em when they' re down . 

As oould be expected, the game ended with a fiid1t , the Jets taking 
on a few of the fans as well as the Mariners. Meanwhi Ie me and Dave 
took off for the locker rooms, Dave walking nonchallantly past the 
security guard while I was stopped and asked where I was going . 
Fortunately I had the pass, otherwise it would have been a long bus 
ride home . 

We ~ren't allowed into the Mariner's locker room rue to the fact it 
was the first visit of a female broadcaster. I guess she wanted to be 
alone ~th the players . So we went to visit Bobby Hull and the Jets . 

Dave looked all official with his little note pad, while I stood there 
with my camera dangling over my shoulder asking stupid questions. All 
Dave asked for was Hull 's autograph. which he got, riid1t in his official 
little notebook . 

Hull was a little upset about the game, saying, "This wasn 't hockey 
as I learned to play it." He also bemoaned the fact that he felt the 
Mariners were picking on the European players on his team li e 
pointed to Uif Niilson and Niilson duly showed off all the bruises he 
received in the game . He was BR UISE D! 

Meanwhile the lady had exited the Mariners locker room 50 I left 
Dave with his idol and went over to talk to Mar iner Coach Harry 
Howell. Howell's only comment was that ," If those Europeans want to 
play in our league, they' ll have to learn to play our style " A little bit 
rough on th~ poor folks, I'd say. 

I fi nally pulled Dave away from Hull and dragged hi m out to hi 5 car 
so he could drive my camera home .

Well, it's dll over but the shouting. Trivia Contest No. 
2 had the bi.est response we've ever had to a TT 
contest. Ma:lY hanks to all who entered. And now, for 
all concerned : ere are the Trivia Answers:

4) Sgt. Friday's badge number was 714. 

5) The three ghosts on Topper were George & Marion

22) U.N.C.l.E . was the United Network Command for

6) Soupy's four puppet friends were White Fang, Black -

contained puns he wrote on the blackboard like 
"Kleptomania isn't so bad - you can always take 
something for it." 

comprised the rest of Donna elley sang 
"Johnny Angel," Paul had two big hits : "She Can't Find 
Her Keys" and "My Dad." The last name was Stone, and 
Bob Crane's wife was named Midge. 

As it turned out, we didn't wind up with a Trivia King. 
Rather, we have a Trivia Kingdom . The best entry was a 
group effort from Graduate Students in the math dept. 
Paul Roudebush, Paul Deland, Greg Galloway, Tony 
Grojanowski, Rod Canfield and AI Eisner have the 
honors. As first place winners, they get to figure out how

8) Rin Tin Tin 's master was Rusty. He was honorarily a 
' corporal . 
9) Chester's Recommendation for making coffee was to

cept that answer as well. 

14) "Seven Keys" was hosted by Jack Narz. His brother is 
Tom Kennedy. 

15) Monty Hall hosted Video Village before he began 
making deals . 
16) lucas McCain was the Rifleman, Johnny Crawford

two hit songs were "Cindy's Birthday" and " Your Nose is 

Second place winner Kenneth Zeidman scored 58, 
and third place was bagged by team Abby and Kathy 
Esty, also with a score of 58 (slipping into third by 
judges decision on the tiebreaker) . They both win stereo 
lPs. And just to prove dumb luck still pays off, our 
random winner was lohn Adler (who incidently only 
managed to score 28), and he wins a prize as well. The 
average score was 40. 

10) Bob Cummings started his show " love That Bob"

Atomic Cafe Cooks Up Unique Evenings of Musi'c 
by Robin Rond 

What is the Atomic Cafe? No, 
it's not some grad student's 
phySiCS project, nor is it even near 
a science classroom here at 
UCSD Yet , there is something 
very nuclear indeed about the 
Atomic Cafe: it is a center of lots 
of energy, entertainment and 
artistic achievement. 

. With many talented performers 
and composers at UCSD, there 
was a need for a place to present 
new, innovative material. The 
talent was certainly available, 
along with people willing to put 
forth the effort to coordinate 

performances. Among those who 
instigated the Atomic Cafe and 
kept it going last quarter were 
Assistant Professor lean-Charles 
Francois, who has been involved 
with experimental music from 
Paris to the United States, former 
director Susannah Ganus, and 
Curtis Abbott . They not only 
organized the Cafe, but have 
themselves contributed to the 
performances. 

The Atomic Cafe was originally 
visualized as a sort of "anti-
concert," or an assortment of 
performances minus the trap-
pings of i\ traditional concert . 
Thele are no printed programs, no 
formal stage setting, and the 

Page 6 Triton Times January 31, 1975 

audience is invited to casually 
gather around the performers . 
The result of such an un-
ceremonious production is an 
atmosphere of relaxation . There 
isn 't the pressure of an "official" 
performance in which the 
musicians are judged or reviewed 
by critics. There is room for 
experimentation . There is room 
for error. Perfection is not the 
order of the evening, and so both 
the people "on stage" and off (the 
audience) have a chance to relax 
and enjoy each other. Even the 
name suggests that the event "be 
a cafe to come to ." (Yes, there's 
even coffee served during the 
course of the evening.) As former 
director Susannah Ganus put it, it 
is a " forum for musical ex-
pression ." 

The Atomic Cafe does not 
confine itself to music per se; 
rather it allows for, and en-
courages, a combination of all 
types of creative expression, 
bringin g forth performan ces 
referred to as "experiential." 

Many of the acts have been just 
that ; they've been absolute 
experiences. 

One past performance was one 
offered by graduate student 
Warren Burt, entitled "Do' Your 
Teddy ' Bears Have Stilettos in 
Their Feet?," which made use of a 
sound and video syntheSizer. 
While the audience was 
somewhat hypnotized (as I was) 
by the curious exhibition of color, 
motion, and sound up on the 
screen, it was unaware of being 
bound with string by other 
students performing Allison 
Knowles' "String Piece." These 
were two independent . per-
formances which, when 
presented simultaneously, made 
for a total sensory experience. 

Another such experience came 
in the form of "Fair Piece," by Ted 
Grove, in which he had put 
together a tape and slide 
presentation from the Del Mar 
Fair. While the audience was 
involved with that , Grove began 
marching thru it selling popcorn !

Again, not just a visual or audio 
performance, but one in which 
the audience itself became in-
volved thru the use of several 
aspects of perception . 

As Curtis Abbott, one of the 
Cafe's coordinators, explained, 
these performances are only two 
which "capsulize" the whole 
concept of the Atomic -Cafe. 
Abbott went on to say that "at 
minimum, the audience would 
have a good time," and that they 
might even " get something 
valuable" from the performances. 
He believes they have. 

What is to come for the Atomic 
Cafe? As for its location, no one is 
quite sure what will happen, or 
rather, where it will happen. 
There are all sorts of possibilities : 
the Revelle Coffee House, the 
coming recital hall at Mandeville 
Center, and perhaps even a night 
at a theatre in Encinitas, the 
Paloma. The Cafe was originally 
seen as a mobile occurrence, 
which might take place anywhere 
on campus, and maybe even off.

may be surprISes . 

Upcoming dates for the Atomic 
Cafe include February 11 (Revelle 
Coffee House), and February 25 
(Student Center lounge) . 
Whatever happens, you can be 
sure of a new and different ex-
perience. 

Auditions for a one-act play by William Saroyan, "H 110 Out 
There" will be held !V\orr':ay February 3 in the Drama Dept Con- Â· 
ference Room in 407 Me at 7:00. 

An off-beat love story, they play offers excellent roles for 1 man 
and 1 woman. There are also 4 smaller parts, for 3 m n and a 
woman . 

The play will be directed by graduate director John Ovrutsky of 
the UCSD drama dept. Any inquiries regarding the auditions may be 
made at x3791. 

As for the content and nature 
of upcoming Cafes, Abbott sees 
the evenings becoming more 
" theme oriented," in which "the 
whole evening becomes a piece 
itself." We may also expect even 
more variety in the acts. One 
proposed idea is an evening of 
original pieces by a student 
composer here at UCSD. They are 
pieces of classical nature, but of 
his own composition and in-
terpretation . The program is open 
and free to all who would like to 
try something new which might 
not be given a chance to be heard 
elsewhere. 

Concert Notes _ by Larry Deckel 

There are auditions and 
rehearsals . After all, chaos and 
total improvisation are not part of 
what is intended here. The acts 
come to the Cafe, as Ms. GanusÂ· 
put it, "at various levels of 
rehearsaL" A planned piece is 
presented, but often without the 
polish of perfection which may 
resu lt in a pressured, cut and 
dried performance, rather than a 
fresh, relaxed one in which therp -

18th Century English Graphics Loring Spitler 

The Mandeville Center Art Gallery has 
obtained from University Art Museum in 
Berkeley a howing of prints, drawings, and 
watercolors executed in England during the 
last half of the 1700's. The show will be on 
campus until February 21 , and open daily 
from 12-5, Sunday through Friday Works by 
Gainsboro. Rowlandson , Hogarth, Romney, 
and Reynolds are seen among the 55 pieces 
on exhibition 

Art of the 18th century was deeply 
ingrained in the elaborate, hyper-manneristic, 
artificiality of the Rococo tyle ; the 
Significance of English graphics during this 
p riod was the use of the medium of print-
making to spread the emerging concepts of 
Romanticism (which embraces a wide range, 
including compassionate human and societal 
concerns , naturalistic landscape, and 
classical revivals) . 

The show is presented in several catagories 
according to the subjects or themes displayed 
by the pieces . Perhaps the most significant, 
with respect to the direction of art during this 
period, is the group of landscapes . Within 
these watercolors and ink drawings, one can 
sense the emergence of a glorifying realism in 
the rendering of nature and human emotions; 
a sty le which completely possessed the 19th 
century, and sti ll holds an endearing grasp 
upon the majority of today's populace. This 
tyle's best known attitudes are displayed in 

two works by Gainsboro. 

The next malor category, one that filled the 
widening gap between the traditions and 
innovations of the period, is satire . Here, 
Rowlandson 's works satirize the traditional in 
art , government, and human ways, and Gilroy 

illustrates the patronizing imperialism of a 
British envoy bringing the Emperor of China 
gifts of toys . The characterizations employed 

"The Lost Drop." Pen and watercolor by 
Thomas Rowlandson 

A group of graphics done in the traditional 
styles of ancient historical and Biblical 
themes reflects the predominate image that 
most people have of the printmaking 
medium This group of 'the classics' is so 
dominate in its conformity of image, that it 
almost obscures that wnich should be the 
viewers growing appreciation of the details of 
the engraver's art . 

., he show advances with depictions of the 
then current scenes (a point of controversy 
for the artists of the day who felt that art 
should reflect the glory of society, not the 
daily trivia) . Joshua Reynolds' "Mrs. Siddons 
as the Tragic Muse" was rendered after his 
influencial painting (likewise for many of the 
show's prints), and displays a fascinating 
coloring technique. Whaley's depiction of the 
"Riot on Broad Street" reflects the 'current 
events' theme on a large scale, with a myriad 
of intriguing details. 

The final group of works by Hogarth (a 
dominate artist in the show) reveals his in-
volvement with a semi-satirical rendition of 
his contemporary society. "Marriage a la 
Mode" (a fantastic collage of details), casts a 
perceptive eye upon the practice of marriage 
arrangement. The end result of the betrothal 
(a divorce, as revealed in the sixth painting of 
his original suite) is subtly predicted by the ' 
pomposity of the' suitor, and the barely 
concealed frustration of the betrothed (which 
is more directly revealed by the rage of the 
symbolic Medusa hanging above her head) . 

The show is well grouped and cannot help 
but envoke a respect for the artists (and-Qr 
their engravers) and envelope the viewer in 

are familiar to most of us because of their an aura of historical relegation which is 
having been concurrent with the political _decidedly rare on the Muir campus (or in 
cartoons of our own Revolutionary period . most of our lives for that matter)
