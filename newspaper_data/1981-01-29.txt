Adm'n, faculty decide for students 
Atkinson will 
give VCSA 
academic bent 

BY JENIFER WARRE N 
News Editor 

Chancellor Atkin on, recognizing 
an increasingly competitive market 
for UC-eligible high chool graduates, 
has announced a re tructuring of the 
Student Affairs Office which places 
its main emphasis on recruitment 
and retention, particularly of Third 
World students. 

At least that's what Atkinson and 
his administrators hope. 

But many students, such as 
Associated Students President Bill 
Topkis, thinks the change could be a 
paper tiger - an insignificant shift 
that will not "improve the deplorable 
job we're doing in recruitment and 
retention , especially of people of 
color. " 

In fact , Topkis argues the change 
would result in a deterioration of 
student life, which would eventually 
hurt retention. 

Atkinson released his decision on 
the reorganization of the Student 
A ffai rs Office Monda , after 
considering four possible stru<:tural 
models since November. 

An -examiniation of possible 
changes in that office was in part 
initiated by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Richard Armitage's 
resignation from the university, 
effective in A~st. 

Under Atkmson's plan, the 
academic service, (EOP, Relations 
with Schools, OASIS, Early 
Outreach, Registrar, Admissions) 
will move from the Academic Affairs 
Office to the Student Affairs Office. 
Also, the Chancellor has changed the 
"Student Affairs" label to 
"Undergraduate Affairs." 

By consolidating academic affairs 
under the Students' Vice Chancellor, 
Atkinson hopes to "take some of the 
load off the Academic Affairs Office 
and allow the new V~ Chancellor to 
concentrate on the crucial areas of 
recruitment and rentention," says 
Assistant Chancellor Patrick Ledden. 

"LoOking at the world of the 1980s , 
there are fewer bodies out there, and 
in order to maintain a steady 
enrollment while increasing our low 
numbers of minority· students, we 
must concentrate heavily on 
recruitment and retention," says 
Ledden. 

Chancellor Atkinson wants an 
academically oriented Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs. 

"To accomplish this task, the 
Chancellor is lookingJor someone (to 
replace Atkinson) who is first of all an 
academician, one who can work with 
the deoartments , with the faculty. 
with junior colleges and high 
schools," Ledden says. "This person 
must be able to conduct an outreach 
program we've lacked in the past." 

But while he a~rees that 
recrUItment and retentIon efforts at 
UCSD have been far below part in the 
past, Topkis is skeptical that the 
change will bring significant results. 

"While it's clear that the academIC 
services here have failed miserable so 
far , it's hard to believe that just 
changing the authority those services 
fall under will be a cure-all," Topkis 
says. 

AS Commissioner of Student 
Welfare Reggie Williams agrees. 
"The mismanagement of the 
academic services is within each 
program itself. Simply moving them 
around isn't going to solve that ," he 
says. 

And Topkis, Williams and Linda 
Sabo, chairwoman of the Student 
Body Presidents Council, all point out 
that the same individuals now 
involved with academic services will 
probably shift to student affairs

CEP wants to 
curtail the use 
of Incompletes 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
Editor 

Hundreds of UCSD undergrad-
uates with Incomplete grades are in 
jeapordy of receiving permanent 
"F " on their transcripts if efforts to 
tighten the grading policy are 
implemented. 

Depending on a decision expected 
soon from the Committee on 
Educational Policy, many students 
who have allowed Incomplete grades 
to lapse beyond one quarter will not 
be able to make up work for the 
course. 

Such a decision would invalidate a 
customary but ambiguous policy of 
professors permitting students to 
receive grades two, three or more 
quarters after receiving an 
Incomplete. 

It would also restrict the grading 
rights of professor , who until now 
have been free to use their discretion 
in assigning grades to students who 
did not make up Incomplete course 
work within one quarter. 

Current university policy allows 
undergraduates one quarter to make 
up an Imcomplete before the grade 
lapses into an F. In this sense 
Incomplete grading policy would 
remain unchanged. 

But the three·§ear-old policy does 
not explicity prohibit professars from 
extending that deadline indefinitely. 
Many students and faculty members 
have interpreted this to mean that 
the F grade can be removed at any 
date with the consent of the involved 
professor. 

Members of the CEP, a branch of 
the Academic Senate which has the 
authority to review and clarify 
academic policies, interprets it 
differently. 

"That F can only be replaced by 
repeating the course," says CEP 
Chairman Lu Jeu Sham. If a large 
number of professors allowed 
students to make up an Incomplete 
beyond the one-quarter limit, "we 
might as well leave it a an I 
(Incomplete)," he says. 

Opponents of the one-quarter 
restriction say the Incomplete 
grading policy is too stringent. 

At UC Berkeley, students have 13 
months to make up an Incomplete 
before it lapses to an F. Students 

CEP Chairman Lu J cu Sham 
wants to make Incompletes 
tougher to get. 

rarely have trou ble extendin~ that 
deadline if necessary, accordmg to 
the Registrar's Office there. 

Similarly, . UC Irvine allows 
students one year to make up 
Incompletes. Unlike UCSD , 
Incompletes do not lapse into Fs on 
students' transcripts beyond that 
deadline, although an F is computed 
into students' GPAs. 

UCLA's Incomplete grading policy 
is identical to UCSO's, and 
extensions to the one-quarter 
deadline must be granted by a college dean: 

Because of the vagueness of faculty 
and student rights to independently 
extend the one·quarter deadline, the 
CEP is trying to interpret the 
"intent" of the Academic ~nate in 
1977, when it first restricted the 
amount of time students could take to 
make up an Incomplete. 

And according to CEP member 
Robert Linck, the intent was to 
permanently lapse Incompletes into 
Fs after one quarter. 

"The whole point of making it 
permanent is to avoid manipulating 
the grade later," Linck says. "The 
intent was to lower the amount of 
time students could make up an 
Incomplete. The (Academic) Senate 
dealt with the spirit of that in 1977." 

However, CEP undergraduate 
representative Barry Hyman says 
that faculty members on the

Li bertarians see the 'Demopublican' party 

• Editor: 
The Democratic Party and 

the Republican Party have 
much more in rommon than 
one would at first believe. In 
fact. they share an identical 
foundation in terms of ethics, 
which is easier to demon-
strate when contrasting both 
parties to the Libertarian 
Party. 

On the sNrjace, all three 
parties are radically 
different. Democrats support 
equal rights for women, 
mmorities and the underpri-
vileged. They also favor a 
strong governmental role in 
national health care, welfare 
and many other programs 
which essentially force the 
taxpayers - us - to do what 

is "right." 
My first question is, if all 

these things are so obviously 
right, why does everyone 
have to be forced to 
participate? If you do not 
think of it as force, try 
withholding the amount of 
your tax dollars that go for 
education, even if you send 
your child to a private school. 
It is plainly obvious that 
many of these ends are 
definitely desirable. Most 
people wou Id agree t ha t 
adequate health care for all, 

. equal opportunities for all -
based on ability - and taking 
care of underprivileged 
others are defimte positive 
goals. In fact many of these 
goals are met in part by 

.'.' ,\ 
. , \ 

privat. individuals voluntar· 
ily tllrough charities, 
foundations and scholarships 
already. The key word is 
voluntarily. The discrepancy 
is that many of us may 
disagree with the means used 
to obtain these ends, namely 
government intervention, i.e. 
force. 

The Republicans support a 
reduction in taxes, believing 
that any dollar spent by a 
private individual voluntariLy 
IS bein~ used more efficiently 
than a dollar spent by a 
bureaucrat. However , 
Republicans favor a mam-
moth defense budget, and are 
quite moralistic in that they 
believe that abortion,

Editor: 
I would li_ to share with 

any who'll take the time some 
- thoughts on our newly 

elected President, Roaald 
Reagan. This let ter has the 
entire American public in 
mind. but it is specifically 
directed to the students of 
UCSD and any others who 
read this newspaper. 

A short time ago, Ronald 
Reagan took office as the 40th 
President of the United 
States. There were those who 
voted for him, and those who 
did not. From my experience 
here at UCSD, I gather that 
most students were not 
pleased by the choices, let 
alone the outcome. That, 
however, is history. There's 
an old chiche, and an 
appropriate one, if I may: 
"The Future is Now." We 
have a sagging economy (as 
economists like to put it), we 
have e~ problems, and 
our world 'Image is somewhat 
less than "American." But, 
we al80 have a leader - a 
President. We have a man 
(for you ladieS out there, I 
mean it in a generic sense ... ) 
in a thanklesS, difficult and 
stressful job with a situati~D 

facing him that seems next to 
impossible. 

Here now is my point: We 
should all put aside our 
prejudices and help together 
to make this country great 
again. Stop analyzing and 
criticizing, yelling, scream-
ing and shouting. Let's all 
work together. Help one 
another, help our President 
- whatever his name or 
background. Unification 
begins on an individual basis. 
Send Reagan your positive 
thoughts, your constructive 
energies, rather than 
criticizing and belittling him. 
He is a strong man and a 
leader. He will do things. He 
is going to try - just as the 
rest of us ought to, rather 
than just sitting and 
complaining, having demon-
strations and "shouting" for 
others to solve our problems 
for us. 

It we all help together, this 
can work. I mean black, 
yellow, white, green with 
polka-dots - whatever_ 
Everybody. From the baby 
just now born to the oldest 
person alive. Let's all try to 
smile a little more. Go on, it 
won't hurt: Make a new

Rally went . ~ 
against 
some wishes 
Editor: 

As a member of Warren 
College Student Council, I 
wish to voice the opinion of 
myself and a clear majority of 
the other council members in 
regard to the Counter· 
Innauguration Educational 
Rally. We decided to endorse 
this rally in view of its 
educational aspects. There 
was, however, very clearly 
anti-Reagan sentiments in 
this rally. 

I am neither pro- nor anti -
Reagan at this point. I have 
remained objectIVe insofar as 
he has only been in Qffice foe a 
couple of days and I don't 
wish to pass judaements on 
actions which he nas not yet 
made. 

In any even., as a 
representative ,roup for 
Warren College, It is to be 
made clear that we as a 
majority are neither pro- nor

is obviously defined in the 
eyes of the beholder) and 
other so-called immoral acts 
should be illegal as well. To 
get people to behave more 
morally, it is necessry to 
legislate and outlaw these 
bad actions. That way we can 
punish those ignorant young 
adults who don't realize that 
pot is destroyjng their brains, 
and we can prevent those 
mothers carrying Down's 
syndrome fetuses from 
getting that nasty abortion 
since it would be a purely 
selfish thing to do. 

Some of us may feel quite 
stronly that we would never 
have an abortion, or would 
not want our wife to have 
one. Some of us may feel like 
punishing our child for 
smoking pot, or for that 
matter smoking cancer sticks 
or God forbid, drinking beer. 
So, some of us, and probably 
many of us may feel that the 
Republican ends are quite 
admirable, but again, we just 
do not like their means of 
achieving those ends; 
namely, coercion and force, in 
the name of the law. 

So Republicans and 
'Democrats may .both have 
desireable, albeit, different 
ends, but they share the same 
means of obtaining those 
ends. They would either 
prevent individuals from 
doing thiJ)gS that they would 
otherwise do if legal (and 
obviously some do anyway) 
or they force us to do things 
that we would not do if 
legally we didn't have to 
(although some of us would 
do those thi~ anyway). Are 
there two different parties 
here? Or, is it just one big 
Demopublican (I thank 
Robert Ringer for this term)

on one end of that it's·OK-to-

Angered 
Editor: 

After reading your article 
on the anti-Reagan rally, I 
was sick to my stomach. I am 
just as thrilled about a 
Reagan White House as most 
of the demonstrators were. 
However, I see little else in 
common between myself and 
those sons-of·bitches that 
tried to hang a Reagan effigy 
from the flag pole. That was 
an act of true degenerates. 
For months, we have had to 
watch a group of third·rate 
terrorists burn our nil{ and 
effigies of former President 
Carter. Are we to take our 
examples from these 
baboons? 

I would like to thank Alex 
Pournelle for his great 
O1uraee in stopping those two 
animals, Jon Bekken and 
Paul Jurczak, from hanging 
the effigy, You are a fine 
American, 

I hope that the organizers 
of this rally did not support 
such an act d cowardice. I 
feel confident that they did 
not. This kind of ~av 
should be left in the ju . 
hope Jon and Paul this 
article and realize what 
animals they truly are!

for the sake of everyone, 

MARK McVAY 

hear so much about. Believe 
it or not, some of us have 
actually jumped completely 
off that tightrope, and have 
declared that although 
admirable ends may exist, it 
is just plain wrong to force 
others to agree with us! In 
fact, Democrats call us 
Libertarians, radical right-
wingers (go laissez-faire!) and 
Republicans call us radical 
leftists (legalize pot!). They 
do not recogni ze that we are 
not walking on their 
tightrope any longer. In fact, 
they probably believe that 
anyone can be placed along 
that narrow two-dimensional 
line. 

Please do not be naive and 
think that we are for no 
government and no laws. 
That criticism is so ignorant 
and childish as to be ignored . 
I really do not think that we 
need laws to convince people 
that murder and stealing are 
wrong, even if some people 
want to do it. What we are 
saying is that every 
individual has the ri6ht to 
expect that no one will force 
him to do anything that he 
does not want to do, as long as 
his actions are not affecting 
this same right of others. We 
refuse to believe that force is 
sometimes· j\;lstified in the 
name of a noble cause. 
Furthermore, a closer look at 
the underlying principles will 
lead one to conclude that 
although Democrats believe 
in human freedoms (no 
victimless crime laws, pro-
abortion) as do Libertarians, 
they do not believe in 
economic freedom (opposite 
to us). Republicans may 
believe in more economic 
freedom - but they do not 
believe in human freedom. 
Well, Libertarians believe 
that by definition, onecannot 
truly have economic freedom 
without human freedom, and 
vice-versa.

Minority .enrollment stagnant in '70' s 
BY RICK DOWER 

S--.to Coneepondent 
The University of California posted 

a 21 percent gain in enrollment over 
the past decade compared to the 19605, 
but the low number of minority 
students in the university has 
remained unchanged. a report by the 
state's higher education commiss ion 
·said this week. 

Overall, UC and the state colleges 
and universities expanded at only half 
the rate during tbe 19708 as they did 
during the hectic growth of the 19605. 
according to the monthly report from 
the director of the California 
-Postsecondary Education COOlmis-
sion (CPEe). 

CPEC is a IS-member independent 
advisory agency charged with 
monitonn, the state's three segments 
eX publichllher education. The report 
is desaibed as a retrospective of the 
past decade for the state s colleges and 
universities. • 

CfEe filures show the number of 
ethnic minorities and disadvantaged 
students at ue has remained viturally 
unc:haIpI over the past several 
years, tioven ... at four percent of the 
total for black students and six 
percent for Hispanic students. 

The CPEC report concedes that 
aoals of a 1974 resolution by the 
fegislatur.e to create a plan to enroll 
more representative numbers of 
minority students in. public 
universitaes and colleges by 1980 have 
not been met. 

Suzanne Ness, CPEC's legislative 
expert, said it still isn't clear why, 
despite affirmative action and other 
prqgrams designed to bring more 
minorities into the university, the 
level of minority enrollment has 
staxed so low. 

• It's hard to say whether the money 
that has pe for affirmative action 
hasn't worked at all or whether it just 
hasn't worked yet," Ness said. , 

She said a major problem is 
achievi"i early enough outreach into 
commumty colleges, high schools and 

even junior high schools - which she 
collectively refers to as "the pipeline" 
- to track minority students into UC: 

Ness emphasized t hat continuing 
low minorit y enrollment at the 
university is rooted at many different 
levels and is not necessarily UC's 
fault. 

"It is an intersegmental problem 
something like dOll)inoes," she s aid. 
"They all sort of stand or fall 
together." 

ePEC's figures for VC's minority 
enrollment in recent years seem 
especially significant in light of last 
month's agreement by university 
officials to give up previously 
approved increases for its affirmative 
action program in its proposed 1981-82 
Governor's budget. . 

The increases for affirmative action 
were identified by UC as one of its 
highest priorities for reducitons, and 

would have included more than 
$600,000 in financial aid, support 
services and early outreach for 
minority students. The legislature 
mayor may not be convinced to 
restore the money during budget 
hearings in coming months. 

One source suggested that the 
legislature, upon seeing that VC 
minority enrollment has not changed 
much in recent years , even with 
affirmative action programs, may 
question whether that money is doing 
any good. 

But a spokesman for the UC 
Studerlt Lobby said legis lator should 
consider how much lower minority 
enrollment might be today without 
affirmative action. 

The CPEC report also noted that 
the number of women attending UC 
over the past decade has increased

the pursuit of haPPiness 
continued from pale 2 
cans is that our -philosophy is 
internally consistent. and that our 
ethical, moral, economic, political 
and social attitudes all radiate 
outward from a basic principle: that 
we are endowed by our creator with 
certain inalienable (automatic) 
rights. The right to life, liberty 
(freedom) and the pursuit of 
happiness. Sound familiar? These 
rights are ours by virtue of having 
been born a human being. They are 
not given tous by the society in which 
we live. We are not allowed to live 
here with our government ' s 
permission. Don't all of you just hate 
It when someone says "Love it or 
leave it?" That cliche' somehow 
implies that they have -the right to 
make us even briefly consider that as 
a real option, as ifour being here were 
in any way due to their approval! 

Anyway, I can mention all the 

usual mollifications. This is a short 
and grossly incomplete and sketchy 
statement full of contradictions, etc., 
blah blah blah. But, instead" w!1I say 
to any and aJl who are even shghtly 
piqued, "Come to the California 
Libertarian Convention on Feb. 13 to 
16 at Kona Kai Club at Shelter 
Island." Listen to the opposition, 
which is what we probably are to 
most of you. Libertarians are not 
afraid of any rational logical 

discus~ion of our differences of 
opinion.

percent to just short of half the 
current student population this year. 
Women students Posted much higher 
enrollment gains at the tate college 
and community college level than at 
UC over the same period. . 

Total enrollment at UC now stands 
at around 134,000, a 180 percent 
increase over 20 years ago and a 21 
percent rise over 1970. As of last year., 
around eight percent of the total 
number of college s tudent s in 
California were enrolled at UC, a dip 
from 10 percent in 1970. UC 's 
enrollment in the 1970s expanded at 
about two to three percent annually. 

Community colleges grew at the 
fastest rate over the las t 10 years, 
absorbing almost half a million new 
students, or 80 percent of the total 
increase of the state's new college 
students. 

The CPEC report identified the end 
of the 1950s baby boom, the undertain 
economic situation, the taxpayer 
revolt of the past two years and the 
"dramatic" expansion of student 
financial aid as the major forces 
shaping California's enrollment 
patterns over the las t 10 years. 

According to the study, funding for 
the primary s tate student aid 
program, Cal Grants, increased 500 
percent between 1970 and last year , 
when t he total reached $80 million. By 
last year, around 14,000 VC student 
had claimed nearly $12 million of Cal 
Grant money. 

Although VC' s enrollment 
increased 21 percent over the last 
decade, state general fund support 
rose by almost 200 percent. In 1970, 
the state offered UC $337 million; its 
budget for next year has been 
proposed by Gov. Brown for $1.08 
bilhon, a raise of 3.9 percent over las t 
year. 

According to CPEC, around two-
thirds of the state money VC received 
during the 1970s went for instruction. 
UC got an average raise from the state 
each year of 12 percent, including 
employee pay raises.

AS Dloves toward vote but 
\Von't back ne\V gov't fortn 

BY JENIFER WARREN . 
News Editor 

The Associated Students Council las t night 
voted to slacked the voting requirements on all 
fee-related referendums, a move that could 
help them considerably in their expected bid 
for an activity fee incrE'lI<"> thi~ Quarter. 

The Council also refused to approve an 
alternat ive structure of student government 
that would have gone up for a vote at the 
comprehen ive referendum in the evenlh 
week. . 

Citing a hi tory 01 a low percentage of 
voters in AS elections, Vice President Warren 
Wheeler recommended to the Council a 
modification of current voting requirements 
on fee-related referendums. For such a 
referendum (such a las t spring' Recreation 
Center vote) to be passed now require a 25 
percent voter turnout and a two·thirds 
favorable vote by those cas ting ballots. 

The AS last night lowered those 
requirements to a 20 percent turn~ut and a 
simple maj<>rity in favor of the Issue for 
approval . Should it be approved by the 
Chancellor and UC Regents , the Council's 
action could help the AS ins titute a much 
talked about $4 Activity Fee increa e they 
were unable to win from students la t pring. 

The AS also deliberated over numerous 
question students will be as~ed to respond to 
in the Feb. F comprehen Ive referendum. 
Among the i ues these quest ions will addres 
are: 

- the use of tudent fees "to provide 
in s ti t utional upport i or militar y 
recruitment" ; 

- the granting of full voting rights to 
s tudent representatives on the Academic 
Senate's Committee on Educational PolIcy; 

- UC Regents' financial involvement with 
companies doing business in the Republic of 
South Africa; 

- the establishment of a Women's tudie 
program at UCSD; 

- the ins titution of Regi tration fee·funded 
paid staff'po it ions it:' the campus Women's 
Resource Center; 

- the granting of rights to st~dents .to erv:e 
on department tenure committees In theIr 
major; 

- . the in ·titution of an optional $2 fee. 
s imilar to the fee asse ed by CalPIRG , to fund 
the AS Internship Office. . . 

Resolutions on the Regents, establt hmg 
academic programs and requiring tudent 
participation 0 11 tenure and Senat e 
committees are advisory: the A~ can work for 
but not mandate their aims. 

According. to the AS con titution , any 
student grouip that submits a "~t.ilio~ ~ igned 
by five percent of the ASUCSD I ehglble to 
sponsor .a referendum question. Practically, 
that mean about 400 Ignatures. Studentsd 
may al 'o get a quest ion on the ba llot by 
gathering two- thirds support of the AS 
Council.

expect. 

The first point to consider 
is that Jimmy Carter's own 
Central American policy. in 
spite of its human rights 
rhetoric. differed very little in 
essential approach from that 
which President Reagan has 
said he intends to pursue. 
When faced with a choice 
between supporting the 
reactionary right or even the 
moderate left . Carter 
instinctively and strongly 
supported the right. And 
even in terms of a 
conservative Republican 
agenda. the Carter policy was 
not the utter disaster the 
GOP campaign made it seem. 

Some examples of the 
traditionally hard·line 
policies the United States 
followed under President 
Carter : 

- In Nicaragua, where-
Carter was denounced as 
being particularly soft on 
Communism, he in fact did 
what his reputedly more 
conservative predecessors in 
the White House did, and 
what President Reagan 
might also have done under 
similar circumstances. He 
supported a discredited 
dictator, even when it was 
clear he was losing, until the 
bitter end. 

- In. El Salvador, Carter 
repeated this same tradi-

committee misinterpret the policy 
and are "trying to justify something 
that truly isn't there-." 

"[ncompletes are something that 
hit everyone. because it involves 
stress," Hyman says. "It can involve 
the slowest student or a genius." 

According to the Registrar's Office. 
approximately 500 students each 
quarter take Incompletes. Of that 
number, about half make up the 
Incomplete the following quarter. 

University regulations restrict 
Incomplete grades to students who 
have "good cause," such as illness. 
personal or family tragedy, emotional 
stress or "other reasons beyond 
his/ her control. " 

Professors have been free to 
determine the validity of these 
reasons, and in effect have had 
unlimited discretion in granting 
Incompletes. 

Sham says he does not want to 
change that policy. 

"I would be very muc~ against 
anything explicity prohibiting 
extensions." he insists, explaining 
that students who wished to extend 
the one·quarter deadline could still do 

so prior to the deadline with the 
permission of their professor. 

But students could no longer 
reverse a lapsed Incomplete after one 
quarter if they did not receive 
approval prior to the end of the 
quarter," he adds. 

Both Sham and Linck belive such a 
restriction does no impinge upon 
faculty grading rights. 

As the "final arbitor" of student 
grades, professors II have control over 
the course in compliance with Senate 
regulations," Sham says. 

But it would be "reading too much" 
into the university policy to allow 
faculty members complete control 
over student grades, he says. 

"We must be careful not to infringe 
on faculty rights," Sham says . "But 
on the other hand. we don't want to 
give them complete, absolute rights, .. 

These rights have come under 
scrutiny in the wake of a recent 
controversy surrounding the grades 
of undergraduate Montgomery Reed. 

Reed, a Communication/Sociology 
double major who is currently not 
enrolled at UCSD and has not yet 
graduated, last month had eight 
letter grades reversed to Fs by the 

Registrar' Office for what he has 
chared is , a violation of univers ity 

gradin~ policies. 
Reed s case is crucial to the CEP's 

reconsideration of UCSD's 
Incomplete grading policy - and in 
fact precipitated the investigation -
because six of the eight letter grades 
in question had originally been late 
Incompletes that had lapsed into Fs. 

The Incompletes were granted to 
Reed between 1972·1975. and were 
not fulfilled until last summer. 

Third College Provost Joe Watson. 
after bemg notified by the Registrar's 
Office of Reed 's updated transcript 
reflecting the grade changes. 
protested to the CEP taht the grades 
were an abuse of university policy. 

At Watson's recommendation. 
Sham and Registrar Ron Bowker 
altered the transcript. restoring the 
grades to Fs, pending CEP's final 
interpretation of the [ncomplete 
grading policy. . 

Both Reed and Hyman argue that 
the grade reversals were improper, 
saying that only profe sors have the 
right to issue or change grades. 

None of the professors who issued 
Reed's letter grades were con uIted 

prior to their -reversal to Fs. In fact. 
two of the professors who issued the 
grade no longer even teach at UCSD. 

Watson asserts that because 
Reed's incompletes had lapsed so far 
beyond the one-quarter deadline, the 
eight Fs could not be changed. 

Wat on. who clashed with Reed 
when the latter helped with the 
leftist Student Cooperative Union, 
says he requested the CEP to 
"disallo'f" the student's lirrades. btlt 
"did not request that they bechangt'd 
with the Registrar." 

He goes on to say that he did ask 
CEP to have Reed's grades reversed 
to Fs. 

Whether Qr Rot the grades were 
reversed legitimately is still unclear. 

Watson says grade changes are an 
"authority] do 110t have," and Sham 
who recommended to the Registrar 
that Reed's grades be reversed to Fs, 
also says he does not have the 
authority to change grades. 

And Bowker says he' 'only changed 
the grade in accordance with- the 
grading policy" but does not have the 
right to "question the integrity of the 
faculty" by changing grades.

this film adaptation of the best-sellirs

MI6Y Tyler Moore, a sweetheart ip TV

mother in a f.mily that starts to 
disintegrate follCM'irs the drowning 
death of a fllllOl'ite son. Don!IId 
Sutherland is her S)m1pathetic husband, 
tryirs to hold the family together. Both 
are good, but Timothy Hutton, as the 
younger son who blames himself for his 
b'other's death, and Judd Hirsch, as the 
psychologist who tries to k£ep Hutton 
from crmirs up completely, are the 
t)est. In all, this is a satisfyi ng,

-Scott and Brando make 'Formula' 
BY JAY MARTINEZ 

In a blurr of activity that

Formula attempts to tap the 
consumer public's imagina,

companies have b.lllJl

actors interact, The Formula 
i in lead a muddle, a chaotic 
assemblage of kooky 
murders, aging Nazi's, and 
unexplained globe-trotting. 
And the two leading men, 
George C. Scott and Marlon 
Branda, are both overweight, 
looking as though they're 
engaging in a literal battle-of-
the· bulge to see who can 
bump the other off the creen 
first. 

The tory begins durjng a 
night bombing raid durin~ 
the final hours of Hitlers 

. Berlin, and end up, at the 
conclusion, in a traffic jam in 
Lo Angeles. What happens 
in that 40 year gap (and 2 
hours of film) is enough to 
baffle even the most tolerant 
viewer, as it consists of uch 
non·sequiter items like 
raging elephants, hot·tubs 
filled with blood , an army of 
black limousine that prowl 
aimle sly, machine pi tols 
waved menacingly, vistas of 
the Swiss Alps, and the 
gyrations of comely frauleins 
in a backdrop of concentra-
tion camps. What this adds 
up to is a kind of visual 
exotica that is more showy 
than knowing. 

George C. Scott, playing an 
LA police detective who finds 
that his routine investigation 
of a recent homocide has 
more far-reaching ramifica-
tions pushes him impre.c;siv(' 
waistline across the screen as 
he travels throgh Europe. 
until he comes across Marlon 
Branda, who portrays a 
behind -the -sce nes oil 
magnate. What might have 
been a surge of electricity 

between the two actors is 
only an annoying tatic 
electricity. Alone, each actor 
is bad enou8h, since their 
re pective gIrths give the 
impression that the screen 
will sudden Iy become 
lopsided and sink under the 
horrible weight. Together, 
though, the two of them are 
most grating as their 
ballooned physiques more or 
less obliterate the scenery 
they're set against and as 
they become little more than 
spa rring partner , each 
re orting to ticks and 
hackneyed manneri ms. 

Scott, for example, 
tightens his chin , compreses 
his weight to the heights of 
his che t a he jabs out 
dialogue through a tight-
lipped snarl. He is photo-
graphed as either a fleshy 
monolith with blue sky 
behind him and expletives 
swirling in his wake, or as 
something that looks like a 
barn door, taking up a good 
two third of the screen with 
a side-kick such a when 
Scott's Asian -American 
partner is wedged into the 
comer of the frame and 
pushed into performing 
menial tasks, or when an 
unexplained thug-iscaprious-
ly behind the massive 
detective, slouching in a 
phone booth, loitering in a 
hotel lobby, or puttering past 
in a black mimcar.

physique like a big, round sea 
sponge, soaking attention out 
of every scene, squeezing his 
eyes or mouth for a trickle of

Americait Graffiti -with a ~atin twist 
BY AL GOODMAN 

SAN JOSE, Ca. - The spray· 
painted words are large and bold, and 
sprawl across everything from , the 
back of a bus seat to the fences 
between hou ses in residential 
neighborhoods . They proliferate 
especially Chicano areas. To many, 
the graffiti is s imply an eyesore, the 
result of criminal acts by teens bent on 
defacing property . 

But looking a little deeper. the 
bizarre inscriptions can be seen as an 
important cultural force , an intricate 
system of codes and symbols passed 
down from generation to generation of 
Chicanos. Throughout the West and 
Southwest, from Los Angeles to San 
Antonio and dozens of other cities. its 
distinctive s tyle can be recognized 
instantly on walls , telephone booths 
and buses. And because much of the 
graffiti is related to Chicano youth 
gangs, some police departments are 
beginning to l ake a special interest in 
it. 

For the gangs, the graffiti stakes out 
and maintains territories . But 
another purpose is cultural pride. It is 
as distinctive as the "cholo" uniform 
of baggy khaki pants, plaid Pendleton 
shirt and sleeveless undershirt worn 
by young Chicano men everywhere. It 
is a quickly recognized symbol , like 
some of the characteristic tattos found 

on Chicago youth. A girl with a 
teardrop tattooe9 on her face is 
recognized as having a boyfriend or 
brother in prison. No other ethnic 
group uses that symbol , and no other 
ethnic group has wall writing like the 
Chicanos. 

"It feels like you're the boss of this 
place. You have to claim the barrio so 
other people will know," says David , 
14, a self·professed ~ang member who 
uses the nickname ' Sir Goofy" for his 
graffiti. "Other people think you're 
bad (meaning good , important)," 

" It makes you proud of yourself," 

says "Lil Joker," 14, who said he 
has been writing for the fun of it for 
three years and is not part of a club. 

Chicano youth for 50 years have 
been passing down, refining and 
paying attention to this graffiti ever 
since it began appearing in areas 
populated by Mexican immigrants. 

Rudy, 16, who began wall writingat 
the age of 10, says he remembers 
seeing graffiti in old family 
photographs. The basic symbols and 
style have not changed much over the 
years, he says. 

At times just a' sign of fun and 

Typical graffiti, done by 14-year-olds, depicting the nicknames the'y use 
when wall writing in their San Jose, Calif., neighborhoods. 

youthful dares. the graffiti can also be 
the signal that will prevent a youth 
from getting beat up by opposing club 
members across the street. 

"It's the style. an ego tr ip," Rudy 
says. '' It',s just clubs (trying to) protect 
their grounds." . 

Above all , this specialized graffiti is 
a nonverbal message intended just for 
those who know the code. 

David says that at age 11 his sisters 
taught him how to write and 
understand the graffiti. The distinct 
lettering system, he adds. is used 
"because white boys don 't know how 
to read it. " 

To many Anglos, the words and 
phrases spray-painted on buildings 
can be puzzling. One reasons is that 
some of the letters are stylized. What 
looks like a " Z" is usually an "L. " An 
"N" is usually written with the slash 
going the opposite direction. To dot an 
" i", a mall "x" is u ed. 

Even when an outsider figures out 
the letters, the meaning doesn't 
necessarily follow. At a schoolyard, 
Rudy pointed to gold letters painted on 
a wal and chal1anged an Anglo 
companion to figure out the message. 
It read:

dialogue. He blots the screen 
and stops dead any story 
momentum. Brando will tum 
his role of oil entrepreneur 
into a vocabulary of slurs, 
stalls, tilts of the head and 
rollings of the eyes, which 
make his dialogue on Milk 
Duds, frogs and telephones 
seem like deflated dirigibles 
of would -be importance. 
While standing center frame 
in a babyblue bathrobe at his 
pool , holding a frog and 
drawling out a dialogue on 
the merits of hiking the oil 
rates, Brando inadvertently 
shakes the story off himself 
and sends the eye to a 
gardener in a sun helmet who 
dillydallys on an already 
immpeccable lawn. 

When Scott and Brando are 
together, the movie behaves 
as though they were two 
huge magnets of the same 
polarity. The two swell on 
the screen and they will only 
get so close to eachother 
before bouncing off one 
another, taking the plot into 
further orbits of speculation. 

Their final bout is in 
Brando's high rise office 
suite, and the feeling of the 
scene is that the understand -
ingof the last 90 minutes was 
left with the Swiss 
chocolates in theAlps. 

The segments that have 
been haphazardly spliced 
together result in a sacrifice 
of structural continuity, an 
ailment that causes Scott and 
Brando to resemble to 
tethered balloons that are 
rubbed together to produce 
not coherence, but rather 
loud and grating queaks.

tempermental clients isn 't 
new and the ending is 
predictable. Its datedness is 
temporarily overcome by Ray 
Sharkey'S gutsy portrayal of 
Vaccari . The scenes of him 
"performing" backstage at a 
teenybopper's dance and 
pitching Tommy Dee's 
potential. to the skeptical 
publi sher of a top teen 
magazine are great. 

The supporting cast, on the 
other hand, doesn't amount 
to much . Paul Land and Peter 
Gallagher are shallow as 
their respective characters, 
Tommy Dee and Caesare. 
The only time the two 
emanate any kind of energy is 
during their s tage perfor· 
mance . The rest of the film, 
they're reduced to plasticized 
Frankie Avalon clones, 
which is a real hame. Tovah 
Feldshuh doesn't fare much 
better in her role as Ms. 
Roberts nor does Joe 
Pantoliano in his part a 
Vaccari's nurdy partner 
Gino. 

Adam Holender 's spark-
ling lighting effects on the 
Brooklyn Bridg and at 
Caesare' Memphis concert, 
Jeff. Barry' driving composi-
tion and Deney Terio' (of 
Saturday Night Fever 
acclaim) lively choreograph y 
provide the audience .wit.h 
brief moment of fIlmIC 
excellence.

BYrP-s from the Hudman 

This week's sad story is 
about losers ... y'know .. . the 
aood 01' un·American kind. The 
one every Jood patriot tries to 
sweep under the carpet . 
Dcaone it ... it's about time 
someone did a story on these 
lUys. I mean really ... isn't 
everyone _ting sick and tired 
about aU 01 this who's number 
one hype. Who cares? So what 
if o.e.m State is ranked el 
numero uno in college 
basketball by 51 AP votes. And 
the Oakland Raiders are this 
year's Super Bowl Champs ... 
big deal! 

Why should these guys get 
all 01 the media attention? 
Heck. there are some great 
loIersout there whoget little, if 
any respect at all. I mean, 
C'IDCIIl ... Iet'S face it. These 

~ show up every week, 
doll t tbe1? They have to look 
in the same mirror C\'£ry 
momin. that you and I 
do. .. poor thinp. Why Joodness 
sakes. lOme 01 them one day 
win even have a wife or 
husband to come horne to. 

Let'. live them some credit. 
They definitely deserve some 
equal time. And who better to 
cover the action (or lack of it) 
than that little whirlwind 
wizard 01 campus athletic 
info. "your friend and ours .. . the 
incomparable Budman Car· 
rothers! 

Always innovating, the 
Budman has come up with an 
ansWel' to all of those Top Ten 
polls, the ones that tell who 
was really bitchin' in sports 
this week. Just released to all 
major media centers .. . we 
praent the Budman's first and 
worst, BOT TOM·OF·THE· 
BARREL ten. .. a tongue- in~r 
poll of this season's 1M 
basketbaD croppers. 

Now not just anybody gets to 
make this undistinguished list. 
I mean, horrors".all of you 
teams out there that have even 
come cIoee to winning a b-baIl 
game this year, need not look 
any further. Your name will 
not appear. You have to be 
reeaaally lousy to make this 
list. 

Take for instance, Bill 
Stri,...'s Hoopalong Cassidy 
club. His coed hoopsters were 
on their way to the top, er 
bottom, 01 the heap when they 
dropped their first two games 
by coloual margins of 12·74 
and 2 .... 94. But alas, they 
couldn't keep up that pathetic 
pace. Last week, they had the 
gall to win one for the Stringer 
32·20".and as a result their 
chances for making the 
BOTTOM·OF·THE-BARREL 
TEN dissapated into the 
aromatic locker room air of the 
Main Gym. 

But we digress ... take a look 
at the rest of this motley group 
and Bet! if your don 't agree. 
Even the presence of Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar couldn't help 
some of these teams. But 
remember .. . while you laugh 
inwardly at their ineptitude on 
the basketball court...don't 
forget all of them are really nice 
people otherwise ... 1 mean ... 
they all have moms and dads 
too. 

10. BRUCE (o.l) ... this coed 
team lost their opener lo. 
34 ... not bad for just Bruce .. . 
now if Jim, Steve, Stacy and 
Julie would show up to help the 
poor guy, they might have a 
chance. 
9. NOBODY (0-3) .. . perfectly 
named. These wall flowers are 
losing some real heartbreakers 
.. . 39-4 0 , 24-27, 23 ·27 .. 
.shouldn't really be rated this 
high, but their pointspreads 
are going in the right direction. 
S. STEEL BALL PLAYERS 
(o.3) ... another appropriately 
named team .. . these guys have 
the shooting touch of a 
blacksmith. 
7. COURT JESTERS (0· 
3) .. . these clowns should be in 
the circus. Anybody who 
averages under 20 points a 
game against A· League 
defenses needs help .. . best 
should puta tent uver this act. 
6. 99 PROOF (o.3) .. . the!\e 
guys are double-dribbling their 
way into the crummy game of 
the year ... On March 1, they 
face the Court Jesters in one of 
the more forgettable games of 
the season. 
5. CUM FROM BEHIND (o. 
2) ... Crunched by 45 ~nts last 
week, this is definitely a down· 
and-cumming team' to be 
reckoned with. 
4. FREAK BROS. (o.3) ... The 
Zack Bros, Dave and Tom, 
should be renamed the Hack 
Bros .. . Both are running neck 
and neck for the 1M record of 
most fouls committed in a 
season. 
3. PIGDOGS IN ORBIT (o. 
2) .. . Chris Ambrose and his 
boys have the right idea .. . 
These space cadets have played 
some real oi nkers this season. 
2. BENCHWARMERS (0-
2) ... This team missed the fi rst 
week of the season and might 
as well have missed the last 
two. After getting blitzed by 63 
and 43. Don Cotter is still 
looki .. for a starti .. lineup. 
1. TACO LIPS (o.3) ... Lost by 
5 points, then 24, then 
46 ... these Jood-looking chaps 
have been devastating. The 
c1inchi .. factor came last week 
in their 95-49 loss to EWO's. 
Nothing to be embarrassed 
about ... except that ELDO's 
had only 4 players.

Atkinson \\Tants 
acadetnic VCSA 
continued from page 1 

alon~ with their areas of res-
ponsibility. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor 
Harold Tern mer, who now 
manages academic services 
in the Academic Affairs 
Office, will move to 
Undergraduate Affairs and 
continue his efforts there, 
Ledden says. 

Temmer, who originally 
recommended that Atkinson 
not transfer academic 
services to student affairs, 
hopes to continue his 
recruitment and retention 
p'!ogran:ts through his 

mnovatlVe concept of the 
enrollment mana~ement 
team." This "team' effort 
!nvolves contacting students 
m the 10th grade and again in 
the 12th grade through 
Outreach and then using 
OASIS summer programs to 
prepare them for enrollment. 

"We should see successful 
growth in under-represented 
populations on campus soon" 
as a result of this "team," 
Temmer says. 

(See related story, page 1.) 
While Temmer is expected 

to continue to play an active 
role in recruitment and 
retention he::e, the Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs will have the final say 
on all policy decisions, 
administrators say. 

By placing such emphasis 
on recruitment and reten-
tion, the Chancellor's 
restructuring plan has raised 
the issue of negligence of non-
academic student affairs. 

The Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs currently 
handles areas including 
Financial Service, the Health 

~enter, th~ AS, intercolleg-
Iate athletiCS and recreation 
and intramurals , Some 
students and administrators 
feel the addition of academic 
services to that ' load may 
downgrade those ·areas in 
priority. 

"The overaJl analysis of 
this reorganization is that it's 

• just putting on paper what 
wt:'ve .known all along, that 
th.ls IS an ~cademically 
onented place, Topkis says. 

"Every time I meet With 
administrators they tell me 
what a great university this 
is, what outstandint{ faculty 
and research facilities we 
have here. The problem is 
that's their understanding of 
what students need and 
want. They're overlooking 
the fact that this may not he a 
great place to be aside from 
the Irreat education you can 
get.''''-

Vice Chancellor Armitage, 
while insisting he could 
easily handle academic 
services in addition to the 
areas he now oversees, 
admits the person who 
replaces him must be careful 
not ~C! lessen support of the 
traditional student affairs 
areas. 

"The Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs must 
be devoted to servi ng 
students as ronsumers of 
recreation, health care, 
financial aids, et cetera" 
says Armitage. "If th~t 
means buying more surf-
boards. for the Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center, then it 
should be done. Or if it means 
increasing the tutorial 
programs at OASIS, then 
that should be done." 

Sabosees another potential 
danger in the consolidat ion of 

academic services in 
Undergrduate Affairs. The 
responsibilities added to that 
o(fic~ necessitate seleCtion of 
a new Vice Chancellor with 
an extensive academic 
background. 

In fact, Atkinson has 
specified that Armitage's 
(eplacement "must be an 
academician who qualifies 
for a tenure position at 
UCSD." 

Sabo fears that the new 
Vice Chancellor amid have 
'\ a hard-line academic 
outlook on things, one that 
may not best represent the 
s~udents' viewpoint." She 
cite the current furor over 
the campus incomplete policy 
as one issue which "students 
really need someone in their 
corner." 

But through all the 
controversy surrou nding 
Atkinson.'s decision, one 
comment IS ever-present - it 
all depends on the individual. 

"First of all , you need 
someone with a reputation 
for being a popular and 
enthusiastic teacher, as that 

~rson h~s already proven 
hiS recep,hveness to students' 
needs. ' says Armitage. 
"Then it's important to look 
for management and 
administrative skills, and an 
ability. to work with advisory 
committees and listen to 
input," he says. 

Topkis and Sabo both feel 
the right indjvidual could 
successfully bolster the 
stud«;nt affairs position they 
f~1 IS now . low in priority 
wlth the University. 

"An academician who is 
respected by the faculty, the 
administration and the 
Chancelror and who under-
stands and sympathizes with 
students would be ideal" 
says Sabo. "But someo~e 

~ith ~ strictly academic 
vlewpomt rou ld really hurt 
us." 

A search committee is 
expected to be formed by 
early next week and will look 
first at UCSD for someone to 
replace Armitage, Ledden 
says. The Chancellor has 
specified that the new Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs, in addition to being 
'an academician, should be 
"preferably someone know-
ledgeable aboUt" the proce-
~ures of shared governance 
In the University of 
California system." 

Many AS officials, who 
preferred to remain un-
nammed, have suggested 
that Ledden himself "with 
his reputation as' being 
responsive and attentive to 
st udent needs and his 
extensive knowledge of the 
history of the student 
movement here," would be a 
good choice for the position. 

Third Provost Joseph 
Watson has also been 
mentioned for the position. 

Atkinson, perhaps sensi-
tive to the criticism targeted 
at the process by which he 
was selected last year, has 
designated three committee 
seats for students - two 
undergraduates and one 
graduate. Two faculty 
mem hers - one Provost and 
two staff members - will 
complete the committee 
membership. 

The ~ hancellor hopes to 
have hired the new Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs by early summer.

Fencers at this past 
weedend's All -Call had not 
only their opponents to worry 
about, but basketball players, 
empty rooms, cramped space, 
lack of sleet and themselve 
as competition. To say the 
meet held in the Main Gym 
was grueling would be a 
gross understatement. First 
day matches started at 8:30 
am on Saturday and did not 
conlcude until 3:30 am 
Sunday morning. 

Because of an apparent 
scheduling mi shap, 90 
fencers from the nine UC 
school were packed into the 
fencing room and the north 
balcony, "I learned a lot 
about myself and I think the 
team member learned 
somet hing about them-
selves," said fencing coach 
Canole, Competing under 
stress as they were forced to, 
"You find out who can really 
work under pressure," he 
said, 

Originally the All-Call was 
not scheduled to be held here. 
But if they are not held one 
year, competition is 
automaticall cancelled- the 
following year . So, s aid 
Canole, "it was the week 
before Chri tmas when we 
decided to have it. " At that 
time bot the main floor of the 
big gym and the Rec Gym 
were booked full for the time 
period . . Two club had 
reserved the west balcony 
(fencing room) until 12 pm on 
Saturday. 

The meet went on as 
scheduled, with little 
indication of the fru stration 
that lay ahead. 

When competition started 
at 8:30 am, 36 men were 
paired off on two strips (or 
courts). The norm for such a 
-meet is six strips. As the men 
fenced, they looked down on 
an empty Main Gym floor 
and an empty fencing room. 

Not until 10 am did the 
classes show up in the west· 
balcony, which they occupied 
for two hours. Between 12 
and 1 pm basketball players 
began to filter into the gym, 
not for the tournament that

THE GUARDIAN 

Sports 
Because of the lack of 
equipment (only five strips 
were in u e during the day) 
women ' matches did not 
begin until 5 pm. So a a 
result of the early delays, all 
the weapons were pu hed 
back until the early morning 
hour . 

Throughout the meet a 
"war -like atmo ph ere 
prevailed ," according to 
Canole. Not that there were 
fight s among the partici-
pant , but "t he place looked 
like a war zone.' 

Canole recall vi ions of 
the movie, Apocalypse Now. 

"Early Sunday morning 
there were bodies every-
where. Fencers just dead 

tired and those resting from 
injuries. It was very rold 
outside and the heat from 
inside condensed water on 
the windows, makin~ the 
place look like the tropics. 

If there were any heroes to 
emerge from the battle, two 
stand out in Canole's mind, 
all the women fencers and 
Wulf Car on. 

The coach observed that 
under the extremely crowded 
conditions and tress he 
received complaints from 
everybody about everything 
- except from the women. 
"Even though their matches 
were pushed way back, I had 
no complaints from the 
female athletes." 

Under the pressure that 
existed during the weekend, 
the males seemed to be in a 
more aggressive state, while 
the females had more 
composure. But the male 
that did well in the finals 
showed similar composure 
throughout the meet, said 
Canole. 

In reference to the fencers 
he aid, " I have a totally new

Because of the lack of space the entrance to the

"He never complained," 
said Canole. "While he 
wasn't fencing he was 
studying the others, and

There was one guy who came 
up to Wulf and said, 'That 

UCSD coach Kathy

together by keeping control 
over the events and

UC·Irvine 
uses TV 
to teach 

From the UC 
News Service 

IRVINE - Elements of 
Genetics by Edward Cecil 
Colin, a "must read" for 
students of heredity in 1941 
but now long out of print, has 
become an indispensable part 
of a complex educational 
television setup between the 
University of California, 
Irvine and the lrvine Unifi~ 
School District. 

A fir t edition of Colin's 
masterwor k is wedlJed 
between a television momtor 
and a video modulator to give 
students the correct viewing 
angle. 

Thanks to the girth of 
Colin's 386 pages of text and 
47 illustrations, UCI 
students in Virginia Boyle's 
curriculum planning class 
viewed from the proper angle 
a live interview with two 
Irvine master teachers of 
high school English recently. 
In fact, the st udents 
themselves conducted the 
interview using the two· way 
telecommunications system. 

The UC I,1USD Interactive 
Video Project , begun in 1974, 
links UCI with the Irvine 
City Hall, the city library, 22 
schools and the district office 
in the Irvine Unifed School 
District . The system offers 
students enrolled in UCl's 
teacher education program a 
new medium to share ideas 
and information with 
st udent s , teachers and 
administrators in the Irvine 
communit, schools . 

The UC Office of Teacher 
Education is believed to be 
the first university depart· 
ment in the nation to utilize 
cable television technology to 
communicate on a regular 
basis in a full two-way 
television mode with another 
educational institution. 

Kim Burge, coordinator of 
the interactive television 
system, said the convenience 
of the system allows UCI 
students to meet and talk 
with a numberof experienced 
teachers who ordinarily 
wou ld not have time to travel 
to campus for a face·to-face 
class discuss ion.

TV influences voters~ 'UCB prof says 
Study examines Nixon, Carter, Reagan elections to see how projections affect votes 

From the UC 
N eW8 Service 

BERKELEY - When 
national television networks 
predict a presidential winner 
mrly on election night. they. 
reduce voter turnout in 
California, which is three 

• time zones away from their 
New York studios. 

The Californians who fail 
to cast their ool1ots, a new 

• . study has shown, are most 
likely to be thosed who are 
well educated and who have 
higher than average incomes. 

However. that is not a good 
reason to clamp a lid of 

secrecy of Eastern vote 
results or to try to keep 
reporters from talking with 
voters, says Raymond E. 
Wolfinger. professor of 
political science at UC 
Berkeley. 

As an election·night 
consultant last · Nov. 4, 
Wolfinger contri buted 
heavil to the election 
analysis broadcast by NBC 
News. 

"It takes the excitement of 
a presidential race to get 
many people to the polls," 
Wolfinger says. 

Since 1960, national 

turnout in Congressional 
elections has averaged 13 
percent higher in years of a 
presidential campaign than 
in off·year elections. Though 
the fates of Congressmen, 
state legislators and local 
referenda are at stake, many 
Americans will not vote if 
they are told their vote for 
president is futile. 

Television tells them just 
that at a time which fO"r many 
California voters is a critical 
time of day - late afternoon 
or early evening, Wolfinger 
points out. · 

The scholar .has drawn 
new findings from data in the 
U.S . Census Bureau' s 
Current Population Survey, a 
monthly survey on varying 
tQpics, which in 1972 and 
1974 quizzed 90,000 Ameri· 
cans about their voting. 

In the 1972 Nixon· 
McGovern race, which Nixon 
won in a landslide. two 
television networks projected 
Nixon as winner before 6 pm 
Pacific time, or more than 
two hours before the polls 
were to close in California. 

PACIPIC STEREO 
California voters who cast 

ballots after 6 pm that year 
made up 17.2 percent of the 
total vote, compared with 
13.6 percent in 45 states east 
of California. 

But in 1974, when the 
networks made no sweepinn 
predictions, "after· six 
voters totaled 21.5 percent in 
California, compared with 
15.2 percent in Eastern 
states.

Congressional district -
enough to influence the 
outcome of a close local race. 

Voter turnout after 6 pm 
was increasingly larger for 
those with more years of 
education, as a general rule. 
But in analyzing Census 
Bureau survey differences 
between 1974 and 1972, 
Wolfinger found the best· 
educated group seemingly 
most affected by news 
predictions. 

In California, for example, 
7.8 percent fewer college 
graduates showed up to vote 
after 6 pm in 1972 than in 
1974, compared with 3.2 
percent nationwide. 

Although projections do 
exert an influence; Wolfinger 
doubts that the voters they 
discourage disproportionate-
ly represen t one party, or that 
many local races were 
decided by no-show voters.

CEP wants to cut time for incomplete 
Would make it harder to get work on two or three quarter long incompletes 

continued from paRe 7 
The grade reversals and re ultant 

confusion has prompted Reed to 
retain a lawyer for consultation, and 
he says he will pursue his case in 
court if the Fs are not reversed . 

Reed maintains that his past 
disagreements with Watson. not 
concern over the Incomplete grading 
policy, sparked CEP's review of the 
grading policy, ,- and that Watson is 
"getting back ' at him by challenging 
his grades. 

"That is not my objective at all," 
Watson says. " [ have no animos ity 
towards that student nor any other 
student." . 

"The thing that concerns me is 
fairness, " Watson explains. "It isn't 
fair to the 8,000 students each 
quarter who do complete their 
courses. 

"Many (students) are getting Cs, 
and they're living with it. But if one 

student gets a C becau e he 
completed his course and another 
gets an A becua e he could take an 
Incomplete, then that's not fair." 

Watson, Sham and Linck all stress 
that they do not oppose granting 
extension to the one·quarter 
deadline if neces ary, a long a 
students make advance arrange· 
ments with their professor. 

But they do not support issuing 
grades to lapsed [ncompletes 
retroactively, as was the case with 
Reed . 

[t is impossible to determine how 
many students have or plan to 
request that their Fs be changed to 
letter grades after the expiration date 
for the Incompletes. 

Bowker estimate that about half, 
or 250, of the students who received 
an Incomplete each quarter make up 
their work one quarter beyond the 
deadline. Only a "handful" of 

students take more than two quarter 
to make up Incompletes, he says. 

Hyman says he knows "lots of 
tudent who have made up 

Incomplete after four or five year, 
and Reed ays he knows "hundred .. 
of students of who have extended the ' 
Incomplete deadline for long period 
of time. 

One former UCSD student, who 
asked to remain anonymous, left the 
university to begin a political career 
two years ago without fulfilling an 
Incomplete. Although she has not 
officially graduated, she say she 
plans to eventually make · up the 
Incomplete - before her employer 
discovers that she does not have a 
univers ity degree - so that she can 
receive her diploma. 

The committee will continue 
discussions on the proposal Monday 
at 4 pm in the Academic Senate 
Conference Room. 

UC gets 
hospital 

continued from page 5 
According to the 

Public Information Director of the 
Hos pital, Pat Jacoby, "The 
University of California has decided 
that it is much more co t-efficient to 
administer the hospital it owns it." 

The terms of the ale had been 
negot iatedfor nearly two years by a 
negotiating committee consisting of 
UC Vice President and chief 
nego! iator William Frittrer, three 
members of the county government 
and Re~ents Robert Reynolds and De 
Witt HIggs. 

The agreement for t he hospital also 
includes the adjacent county mental 
health facility and a nearby power 
plant, as well as a laundry.

Rather than countenance the 
emergence of a broad civilian 
coalition in EI Salvador, 
ranging from devout 
Catholics through · liberals 
and social dem6Crats to 
Marxists, he shored up, with 
cr ucia l diplomati c and 
military support, a military-
dominated junta under 
which orne of the most 
grotesque violations of 
human rights in the history 
of Latin America have 
occurred . Indeed. one of the 
last acts of the Carter 
administration was to 
resume military aid to EI 
Salvador after a brief cut·off 
prompted by the murders of 
three American nuns and one 
American layworker there, 

Today, thanks to the 
Carter policy, Et Salvador is 
radically polarized and the

regime of the tdJId Reagan

much. : 

- Even in democratic 
countries like Costa Rica, the 
Carter administration 
followed policies much more 
akin to those of cooservative 
Republican realpolitik than 
of liberal Democratic 
idealism. and gave US 
convenience a much higher 
priority than Ceo tral 
American social or economic justice. Carter. for example, 
strongly opposed Central and 
South American effort to 
form a coffee cartel.
