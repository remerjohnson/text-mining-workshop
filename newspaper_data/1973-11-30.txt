5' and Dime Features 
"Smoke and Flame" 

Where would you go if 
you got hungry at 10:30 at 
night? Jack in the Box? 
Carnegie's? 31 Flavors? Of 
course not . For con-
venience, speed, and low 
cost, you 'd go to the 5 & 
Dime, located in the Muir 
snack bar. 

"We carry the usual items 
(like coffee, tea, donuts, 
and hot chocolate) , but we 
also have Russian tea , 
ci nnamon toast , coffee 
mocha, and hot and cold 
Cider," explained 5 & Dime 
co-c hairperson Laurine 
Hodges . " However, our 
purpose is to be more than 
just a place to buy food ." 

In addition to the food , 
the 5 & Dime features live 
entertainment plus free 
movies every Monday 
night. Tonight the 5 & Dime 
is spotlighting " Smoke and 
Flame", a live rock group . 
The performance starts at 
9 :00. 

Lau ri ne's co -worker , 
Charl es Nash, cont inued. 
" We would like t6 see the 5 
& Dime used as it gathering 
place for t he entire 

University commu nity, to 
give peop le a chance to get 
together with friends and 
sip some hot cider while 
sitting around the fireplace 
and listening to music . We 
also encourage people to 
come in and study . In fact, 
during finals week, we will 
be giving away free coHee 
and tea as a public service." 

The 5 & Dime is com-
pletely non-profit and is 
staffed entirely by 
volunteers: However, 
the volunteer aspect is the 5 
& Dime's greatest problem 
at the moment. It is having 
enormous difficulty in 
getting enough people to 
work . Due to the lack of 
volunteers, they've had to 
close on Saturday and 
Sunday nights. 

If you would like to 
volunteer to work, call 
Laurine at 452-0556 or Pat 
at 452-8995, or stop by one 
night and give yo r name to 
the manager. If you or your 
group would I ike to per-
form, give Charles a call at 
451-4247.

made Santa a believer in 
the Alaska Pipeline . There 
was no gas to be found and 
he was in a fix . Well, he 
knew one Arab king who 
was getting coal in his 
stocking 

" Good afternoon. sl' r . , 
"came the voice over the 
phone, "Zeus Transport Co . 
Can I help you?" 

" Yes, " George replied, " I 
need you to make 
deliveries. I've got three 
million tons of toys to 
move. Can you handle it?" 

"Of course, sir," came the 
si lky voice. "Can I have 
your name and address?" 

" George Claus, North 
Pole." 

"Could you be more 
speci fi c sir?" 

" Its the only place here; 
you can't miss it." 

" A little off the beaten 
path, eh sir? Now, when do 
you want yo ur units picked 
up and del ivered 7" 

George crossed h is 
fingers . "Tomorrow night," 
He said . 

There was a pause at the 
other end and then in a 
voice that sounded peeved, 
the secretary sai d, "Si r, I'm 
afraid that's impossible. All 
of our drivers are off for a 
week starting tomorrow. 
Good day." 

" Good day," Santa 
sighed . 

Well , that was all of the 
trucking companies . 
Nothing to do now but wait 
for Miss Snipe to locate

receiver from his ear to ' 
keep from being deafened 
by Rudlolf's laughter. 

I've been waiting for this, 
Georgie. What's wrong? The 
sleigh break down? Aw, 
what a shamel Suffer Claus! 
That sleigh put me out of a 
job five years ago and I'm 
not about to bail it out now. 
No, Georgie, I'm no fool. " 

" But what am I going to 
do wi th all those toys?" 
George pleaded. 

Aside from being im-
polite, Rudolf's suggestion 
was also impOSSible . 

It was a beaten Santa 
Claus that came home that 
night. Marsha, his wife, 
greeted him at the door 
with a kiss. 

I'm sorry dear." 
" How'd you find out?" 

George asked, removing h is 
coat . 

"Miss Sni pe called me." 
San ta nodded and 

shambled down the hall. I'll 
be in the den." 

C orge dragged himself 
through the lush pile 
carpeting and sat on his 
recliner . He flipped the 
switch and waves of Niagra 
cyclo-massage soothed his 
back . 

Things were bad, there 
was no disguising it. If only 
Donner and Blitzen hadn' t 
retired ... 

Feeling the need for a 
good dose of Christmas 
spirits, Santa reached into 
the cabinet and removed a 
fifth of the Jack Dan iels 
variety. A few glasses later 
and George wasn't worried 
too much about missing 
Christmas and losing the 
franchise. 

"Come and eat, George," 
Marsha sa id at the door. 

" Hello, Rudolf?" 
"Oh, it's you," 

sneered. 

George brushed the 
Rudolf I sugarplum visions from his 

head and tramped to the 
table. "Look Rudolf, I'm in a 

jam, and .. . " 
"Sorry, George . Can't part 

with a dime ." 
" No, I don't need dough, 

Rudy ... " 
" Rudolf ," came the 

correction. 
"What I'm trying to say is 

won't you drive my sleigh 
tomorrow night?" 

Georl:e had to pull the 

" What's for supper , 
honey?" George asked, 
peripherally interested. 

"Anything on the table," 
Marsha rejoi ned hoppi ng

kiss on Santa's forehead . 

Ceorge smiled and 
reached for the potatoes . 
"Thank you Marsha."

Democratic Representation for Farmworkers 

e c : t to 
be rEpresented by those people whom they choose by 
themselves. This focusing of the issue implies giving 
greater attention to the desires of farm workers than the 
desires their employers, but it must be remembered that 
such attention is entirely approporiate and necessary 
when the issue is worker, not grower, representation. 
Only after workers are given fair representation can the 
further questions between the two groups be resolved . 
2. Lettuce workers have adequately expressed their 
desire for representation by UFW· 
Request for UFWOC assistanci! : During the grape 
boycott , worker committees from the lettuce fields 
came to UFWOC asking for help in organizing lettuce 
workers for contracts . They were promised that when 
UFWOC resources were available they would have help. 
But the lettuce growers and Teamsters, without con-
sulting workers, announced contracts as soon as the 
grape contracts were being finalized . 
Refused election : Cesar Chavez of UFWOC called for 
elections to see wh ich union represented the workers, 
saying that now was the time for an election, that the 
workers would rather have an election than a strike, but 
that if the election were refused, workers would have 
"to vote with their feet" in a strike . Elections were 
refused. . 
Strike : Teamster organizers went into Salinas fields to 
sign up workers, at some points giving the workers a 
choice of signing or loosing their jobs. On August 23, 
1970, 3,000 workers voted for a recognition strike for 
UFWOC. The next day the Salinas agriculture was hit by 
the largest strike in U.S. agricultural history, with 5,000 
to 7,000 workers leaving the field, as reported by 
numerous newspapers at the time, including the pro-
grower Salinas Newspaper (documentation in the 
history section) . 

The strike can only be considered an overwhelming 
statement by the workers in support of UFWOC. Its 

by Jane Yett Kiely 
power was broken by strikebreakers (as testified by 
growers and Teamsters) and injunctions, but the 
representational issue was made clear at considerable 
cost to workers and growers alike . The Salinas strike was 
the strongest representational strike in farm worker 
history. 
Grower statements : Cal Watkins of InterHarvest said at 
the time that the Teamsters have our contract, but the 
United Farm Workers have our workers. 
Card check elections : Card checks were held at three 
farms which agreed to rescind Teamster contracts: 
InterHarvest, Mel Finnerman, and Freshpict Foods. 
UFWOC won all three overwhelmingly. The Teamsters 
did not participate in the card checks. 
Secret ballot ratifications : Contracts were ratified by 
farm workers in all of the companies which signed with 
UFWOC except one. Ratification was by secret ballot 
election . In the other, the InterHarvest contract, 
workers as a group participated in the negotiations by 
frequent exchanges with Delores Huerta, who was 
negotiating for the union. 
Support for Teamsters : Since the employers have been 
unequivocably on the side of the Teamsters and since it 
is in fact the Teamsters who have contracts for most 
lettuce workers, it should be expected that some 
workers, after two years of no progress for UFW, would 
support the Teamsters. There certainly must be workers 
with Teamster preference or no union preference, and 
the Teamsters and growers hope to increase their 
numbers by attrition through time. There is nothing 
unacceptable with farm worker representation by more 
than one union, but it must be fair representation . 

Teamsters are now collecti ng "authorizat ion cards" 
claiming them as evidence of farm worker support. They 
are, of course, after-the-fact since the employer and 
union have already made an agreement.There is history, 
admitted on all sides, for Teamster firing of workers who 
do not sign . And there is further inappropriate incentive 
to sign : Once 51% of the workers at a farm have signed, 
workers receive checks for retroactive wage increases. 

OPINION 

v.s. 

One grower cited these as being well over S100 per 
worker, and claimed the Teamsters were using the 
checks as a carrot in gathering cards.27 By keeping the 
wages down unti l the cards are signed and then 
authorizing retroactive wage payments, Teamsters are 
selling their authorization cards for a price. These might 
be more accurately called retroactive wage cards than 
authorization cards . 
Continuing actiYities in supoort of UFW: The workers, 
despite two years without success, have continued 
working . on the boycott and on strikes at some 
locations. Hundreds of lettuce workers are participating 
daily in UFWOC activities. (Even paid organizers of 
UFWOC receive only subsistence pay, while Teamster 
organizers earn good salaries .) 

Growers suggest that not as many workers want 
UFWOC now as two years ago, but there is not any 
evidence available beyond grower suggestion . It is more 
surprising that after two years of little progress there are 
still strong groups of workers daily working with UFW. 

These indications of worker support for UFW in 
Salinas are supported by worker actions in Delano, in 
the grape industry. There workers had a chance, in a 
secret ballot election, to choose directly between the 
Teamsters and UFWOC, and they chose UFWOC. The 
Salinas strike and resultant card check elections at a few 
ranches have been the most direct votes of the lettuce 
conflict, and they have been overwhelmingly wo~ oy 
UFW. The w.orkers have sufficiently voiced their choice 
01 union but have been without power to enforce it. 
3.Crowers have i nored fair em 10 er ractice b 
which t ey s ou recognize t e union of their em-
ployees choice, and have recognized a union of their 
own choosing instead. 
According to the Ca liforn ia Supreme Court: 

There is no suggestion in the re ord that the 
Growers, before taking such a step (approaching the 
Teamsters), attempted to ascertain whether their

EDITOR, TRITON TIMES 
As we are. all painfully 

aware, the present shortage 
of petroleum products has 
led to substantial pressure 
for the conservation of 
motor fuels. One way to 
reduce fuel consumption is 
to make more use of public 
transportation, yet often 
the greatest barrier to such 
use is the lack of reasonably 
convenient routes and 
schedules . From the east 
side of Pacific Beach near 
Interstate 5, for example, 
one must take a bus to the 
ocean and then transfer to a 
bus which travels through 
downtown La Jolla enroute 
to the University and the 
Veterans' Hospital : a travel 
time of more than an hour 
as an alternative to a drive 
of less than 10 minutes. This 
particular location is in-
teresting because it could 
constitute a stop along a 
freeway bus route between 
downtown San Diego and 
our area which might also 
be extended to Del Mar and 
other North County 
communities, and which 
would offer an alternative 
transfer route between 
those communities and La 
lolla . 

The San Diego Transit 
Corporation is studyi ng 
routes and is interested in 
receiving suggesti ons . I 
talked with Mrs. Noble at

considering. 
I ncidentally, I think San 

Diego Transit is to be 
commended for removing 
another barrier to the use of 
public transportation with 
the implementation of their 
25 ¢ fare.

The article, Richard

Reply to 
Rude Blacks 

Mr. " honky" your denial 

whole different perspective. 
Regarding your criticism of 
remarks made during the 
movies, they are trivial. The 
comments made was a sort 
of tiving around among 
Blacks, a culturally ac-
cepted thing in a sense. But, 
I guess you wouldr;!,t be 
able to relate to that . Right 
honky? The incident about 
the innocent yawn, how in 
the hell do you know it was 
so damn innocent? The 
situation you really seemed 
to despise was the reaction 
the Black women had when 
they saw the handsome 
Black actor, (not Negro, 
damn it, but Black) Billy 
Dee Williams. Have you 
never exclaimed your 
emotions outright in a 
movie? I'm sure you have 
many of times . Well , that's 
all these young ladies were 
doing. 

I believe the situation to 
discuss is not the behavior 
of Blacks but that of whites. 
I can recall vividly the 
movie that was shown on 
Nov. 9, 1973. " Fist of Fury". 
I believe 98% of the 
audience were white, 97% 
acted like childish, sadistic, 
perverted, and rude honkys. 
This has been the habit of 
whites in all the movies I 
have attended . Think about 

to the fact that you are not it. 
a racist is futile . The 
misusage of the words 
Black and Negro along with 
your trivial criticisms 
epitomizes your ignorant 
and racist character . I n-
dividual or groups of whites 
have been involved in 
similiar incidents preceding 
this one . Were they 
criticized so openly? Hell 

Cisco (Kid) 

McElroy 
Criticized 

My name is Jon B. 

no . Why? For the simple 
reason that they were 
white. This reason makes 

I basically agree with my 
fellow staff member, Mr. 
Froman, who opposes 
Chancellor McElroy 's 
wholesale endorsement of 
Erving Kahn ' s monster 
shopping center and 
asphalt oasis to be con-
structed near the campus. 
As starters, I feel that the 
Chancellor has no business 
running cheek and jowl 
with "the mad land rapist" 
of San Diego country-
namely Mr. Kahn . The 
Chancellor should have no 
business endorsing com-
mercial land development 
by land tycoons and as a 
matter of fact I feel the 
Chancellor should 
discourage land 
development of ' any sort 
near this campus. As it is 
now, we have a beautiful 
campus that is surrounded 
by a "wilderness" buffer 
lOne that sets the campus 
apart and enhances it. Large 
scale land development will 
give us nothing but more 
pollution, traffic and crass 
commercialization : We will 
be up to rear ends in 
cheeseburger wrappers in 
no time. 

I think it is clear that Mr. 
Kahn wanted the University 
endorsement as a con-

v~nient and molifying 
excuse to help him ram this 
Universi! ', City plan down 
the throats of the city of 
San Diego. In the end, this 
project will be like a war-
when it gets started, there 
will be no stopping it and 
Mr. Kahn, despite promises, 
will build exactly what he 
wants in order to put more 
money in his already 
bulging pockets . 
. I would also like to ask 
Chancellor McElroy what 
he is doing about large 
scale cutbacks in research 

Farmworker's Rights 
Continued from Pg. 4 

respective field workers desired to be represented by the 
Teamsters, or, indeed, that the question of their field 
workers' preference was even raised as a relevant 
consideration . 

Herb Fleming, president of the Salinas grower 
association, said farm workers' " like any employees, 
would have to go along with their employers in any 
contract. If they don't choose to be Teamsters, then 
they don't choose to work for me. 

Why have the growers, historical foes of union, 
willingly signed contracts with the Teamsters? " It is the 
price they are paying for protection" from UFW, ac-
cording to a grower journalist Bill Grami, Citing his ease 
in gaining contracts for the Teamsters, says "UFW has 
given the growers an unpleasant alternative to our-
selves." 

The reasons for grower avoidance of UFW are, as 
explained above, not directly relevant to the question of 
representation, since it is the workers who should 
choose the union, not the employer. It is important, 
though, to be clear that the growers have chosen the 
Teamsters for the sake of their own interests and not the 
interests of the farm workers, as they often claim. 
The Teamsters offer several advantages to the grower: 
-Teamsters are less likely to strike because they have 

organized workers in the food processing line who 
would be hurt by strikes . 
-The Teamsters are more of a known quantity. They are 

part of the business mainstream and don't talk of "a new 
order of things : ' Don Razee of the California Farmer 
says " It is this unwillingness to separate the social 
movement from union business that makes the UFWU 
contract so impossible to tolerate." Grower business, on 
the other hand, is highly pol iticized and mixed with 
grower causes . In 1972, Merrill Farms, for example, 
proudly boxed lettuce in red, white and blue cartons 
labeled " Re-elect the President Lettuce." 
-The Teamsters are not the traditional enemy. Growers 

who have refused to recognize the equal ity and dignity 
of their workers, can still ignore them and deal with the 
" representatives" who speak for them. With more 
distance from the worker, the Teamsters will not be 
expected to demand so much for them : "The Teamster 
approach is clearly economic, not emotional as is 
UFWU's." 
-Teamster contracts leave more rights to the 

management, do not ask job-loss protection against 
mechanization, have no hiring hall provis ions, reinforce 
the labor contractor system, and appear less demanding 
on pesticide control, all advantages for the grower. 
(Some disadvantages under the Teamster contract : 
Some higher wages, and paying into unemployment and 
penSion funds.) 
-The confusion factor is probably the greatest ad-

vantage of the Teamster contracts . Growers are no 
longer the belligerent employer refusing union

recognition . If an opponent mentions worker choice of

a strong union, can do more for the worker, or claim the

rilnk and file mf'mbers." 

The California upr me Court I arly ruled that the 
~ituation is not a " jurisdi tlonal dispute" when "an 
pmployer grants pxclusive bargaining status of his 
pmp loyees ." But the growers (and afeway) continue to 
refer to the ~ituation as a " jurisdictional dispute," 
adding to the onfusion and making it more difficult for 
the av rage-c itizen-potential-boycotter to sort out the 
injustices. 

Surprizingly enough, grower problems with urw are 
continually cited as reasons UFW should not exist, and 
Teamster advantages to the grower tend to be cited 
along with Teamster strength , as reasons why th~ 
growers, not the workers, preferred the Teamsters and 
why, as the Supreme Court said, the growers exercised 
"the ultimate form of favoritism, completely sub-
stituti ng the employer's choice of union for his em-
ployee's desires ." 
4. The 1 eam ters Union has acted in its own. not the 
farm workers' interest. 

The purpose of a union is to facilitate self-
determination of mployee through their collectively 
expressed desires . But the Teamsters did not even 
contact the workers before signing the initial contracts, 
and they have refused to acknowledge the workers 
desires for representation of UFW. While the UFW has 

lected ranch committees, elected officers, has 
volunteer help, and worker participation in the 
decision-making process, there are no such parallels in 
the Teamster organization of farm workers . 

What are the advantages to the Teamsters? 
-The California SUl)reme Court decision states that 

William Grami of the Teamsters said the Teamsters were 
interested in negotiating industry-wide collective 
bargaining agreements covering all the field workers in, 
and beyond, the Salinas Valley. Grami's declaration 
explains that the Teamsters' interest in representation of 
truck drivers and food proceSSing workers, employees 
who would be adversely affected if the field workers 
went on strike; he related that "t he Teamsters intended 
to protect these members by protecting the flow of 
goods from growing through distribution ." 

-The line between food processing and field work is 
increasingly vague, with more processi ng-type jobs in 
the fields . The Teamsters , who have organized workers 
in food processing, are t(),ing to protect these jobs . 

-According to Einar Mohn, Director of the Western 
Conference of Teamsters, the Teamsters anticipate the 
day when Mexican-Americans doing unskilled work in 
the fields will be replaced by more "sophisticated" 
white workers on machines, making possible worker 
participation in a " real union" of Teamsters : 

Question : What role do you see the farm worker 
playing in the Teamsters Union which represents th m? 

Mohn : We have to have them in the union for a 
while . It will be a couple of years before they can start 
having membership meetings , before we can use the 
farm workers' ideas in the union ... I'm not sure how 
effec tive a union can be when it is composed of 
Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals with 
emporary visas. Maybe as agriculture becomes more 

sophisticated, more mechanized, with few r transients, 
fewer green card rs , and as jobs become more attractive 
to whites. then we can build a union that can have 
structure and that can negotiate from strength and have 
membership participation . . 

Question : What will happen to the workers displaced 
by mechaniz~tion? Is there any protection in the 
contracts for them? 

Mohn: No, that isn 't a problem to solve in this way. 
Shortage of jobs is th problem . If there weren't such a 
shortage of jobs. Mexican-Americans could get jobs . I 
don't know what will happen to the Mexican-
Americans. After .all , you can't xpect whites to st p 
aSide and let M xlcan-Americans and Negroes have the 
(machine) jobs th y have had for years . 

If thi S philosophy guide the Teamsters, who say they 
plan to organize agriculture across the ountry, th y 
actually need to perpetuat farm workers ' voicelessness ~ince it i the territory (the field, where machine job ' 
will In rease) nol the current workers (who will b 
replaced by the machines) that the Team ter are In -

predominantly Spanish-speaking work force. While a 
UFW organizer says his main job is to get workers to 
speak up for themselves, the Teamster may possibly be 
locked into a goal that r quire suppression of long-
rang work r needs . 

Certainly there is idealism in Teamster organizers who 
want to help workers , and the " new Team ter contract 
pats the worker on th pock'etbook, not the back ." But 
the crucial qu stion is not th e money in continuing the 
pattern of voicelessness . The question is now to attain 
worker self-determination that will overcome the 
contradictions in the paternalistic treatment workers 
have received for so long. 

5. UFW cannot or anize and fairl in other areas unless 
the prec ent 0 grower se ection 0 a union is ro en . 

Lettuce is recognized by both unions as a test case . 
UFW cannot give up on lettuce and go on to other 
fields : the precedent isnow that growers trying to avoid 
UFW can arrange contr~ cts with another un ion of their 
choosi ng . 

If the precedent is broken by the economic pressure 
of a boycott, other growers and the Teamsters will think 
seriously about trespassing on a prinCiple that has such 
popular support . Until the precedent is broken, the 
Teamsters can " let UFW do our organizing for us" by 
fnghtenefng growers into Teamster contracts. 
. More than one union may well find a place in the 

fields, but the current crisis is over the method : that it 
should be the worker who choo e their union . 
6. Recommendation : That Safewa bo ('ott the lettuce

Farmworker's Rights 
Continued from Pg. 6 
r ebruary, 1973, statement by Sa feway reads : 

Safeway is not a party to this dispute We will 
continue to recognize both unions as ~taunc h advo('atE'~ 
of their rank and file members . We cannot , in all good 
conscience, select one union over another for any farm 
worker by refusing to buy product from a grower who 
may have igned with a union that is displeasing to 
some. 

While Safeway claims neutrality. it is applauded for 
its action by Teamsters and growers "Safeway's stand 
has always been just exactly right ," and UFW members 
bitterly accuse Safeway of not exercising its social 
responsibility : "Safeway is so rich and we are so poor 
Why can't they help us?" 

Safeway points out that it contributes to 
organizations intended to uplift minorities, including 
Spanish speaking people, but its continuing purchases 
of Teamster lettuce support the more important in-
justice of grower selection of a union . Helping minority 
organizations while buying Teamster lettuce is like 
helping a man up while standing on his back . 

Safeway also speaks up for secret ballot elections and 
national legislation , both of which, if done in the in-
terest of the farm workers cou ld make an important 
long-range contributions. Hopefully Safeway willsupport 
legislation that farm workers will appreciate. But in the 
current historical situation advocating elections and 
legislation is completely inadequate. Such advocacy 
shou ld not be used to avoid the more difficult cu rrent 
challenge, which is allowing farm workers their choice 
of unions, whether or not elections are allowed. 

Safeway has a well-established precedent for dealing 
with such i~sues . In the past worker groups have come 
to Safeway complaining of employer unfairness. (Their 
charges have included the farm worker charge tf,at the 
employer was trying to destroy their union and refused 
to recognize it .) Safeway would then conduct an in-
dependent check of the situation . If Safeway deter-
mined that the employer was indeed unfair, Safeway 
would, unilaterally and independently of the union, 
boycott the employer's product. 45 

UFW has approcached Safeway with its complaints 
that the growers are seeking to avoid the worker's union 
This study finds that complaint valid and recommends 
that Safeway boycott the lettuce of growers with 
Teamster Contracts . Certain other growers whO do not 
have Teamster contracts have refused to recognize the 
union in the same manner and should be Included in the 
boycott group. 

If Safeway makes such a decision, it will be difficult 
to obtain enough lettuce from other sources, because 
th is injustice involve~ most of the lettuce industry 
Safeway would, therefore, not be able to provide ample 
lettuce (it is only head lettuce that is in the question) to

hicano Drama Tonight 
Jorr. Huerta, founder and director of 

" EI Teat 0 De La Esperanza", will give a 
brief 'a k about Chicano theatre and 

he film version of one of the 
Teatro's very successful productions, 
Brujerias. "EI Teatro" has toured widely 
performing "aetos", often to audiences 
who hod never seen Teatro Chicano, but 
who were thrilled with this "new" form of 
education and entertainment. Huerta's 
company began performing Valdez's actos 
and is grateful to EI Teatro Campesino for 
allowing them to perform these actos 
which Huerta considers " marvelous tools-
for awakening the consciousness of La 
Raza." 

Rodrigo's Brujerias was the company's 
first step away from the traditional acto 
and is probably their best received 
production to date . The delightful little 
comedy is successful with both English 
and Spanish speaking audiences, but a bi -

lirgual group appreciates it the most . 
Although Rodrigo did not intentionally 

writ a political comment in this play, the 
statement eems clear: see what your 
superstition and greed can do to you. 
Superstition, of itself, is certainly not 
harmful. But taken to the extreme, 
superstition can create imaginary monsters 
in our heads if we allow our malice to 
overtake us. Don Rafael is the original 
superstitiou member of this duo, but after 
Dona Petra has called la migra, she" too, 
begins to imagine that the spirits are after 
her. Rodrigo's Brujerias is not simply two 
comic characters caught in a situation 
comedy. They have put themselves in this 
position , but their Cathol ic supersition 
keeps them there, and herein lies another 
sociopolitical comment 
. The lecture and fi lm will take place in 
the UCSD Theatre at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, 
"'lovember 30. No admission charge.

Thursday, December 6 at 8:00 p .m. in 

Sherwood Hall, the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art will present Jordan 
Belson'S ALLURES, Oskar Fischinger's 
MOTION PAINTING NO. 1, Harry Smith's 
EARLY ABSTRACTIONS, James Whitney's 
YANTRA and James and John Whitney's 
FILM EXERCISE NO. 4, as part of an eight-
month introduction to American Ex-
perimental Film. All of the films in the 
program are animated, and several of them 
are in brilliant color with accompanying 
I ndian sitar music and music by Johann 
Sebastian Bach. Many unusual techniques 
were used to create the films including 
painting directly on film footage and 
colors painted on glass. One of these 
experimental programs will be presented 
monthly. later programs will include films 
by filmmakers such as Andy Warhol , 
Michael Snow and Paul Sharits, 

On Thursday, December 13 at 8:00 p.m. 
in Sherwood Hall, the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art will present Jan Kadar's

claimed foreign films of the mid-1960's 
and the winner of the Academy Award as 
Best Foreign Language Film . 

Like the Diary of Anne Frank, The Shop 
on Main Street personalizes mass-
destruction during the Nazi occupation . 
Through detailed observations of the 
humor, irony and pathos of everyday life, 
Kadar and Klos involve us in the 
characters' lives. 

Much of the film's power derives from 
the incredibly subtle a'nd intelligent acting 
by the two leading performers. Ida 
Kaminska was nom.inated for an Academy 
Award as Best Actress for her work in this 
movie. 

The program is the third in a series of 
Eastern European contemporary films that 
will be shown at the Museum through 
early 1974.

.. . and Ringo Starr's flashing billboard 
gets a power cut in the glitter burg of 
Hollywood. 

The billboard, located so that it is 
unignorably noticeablp to drivers on both 
the Sunset Strip and La Cienga Blvd ., spells 
out the letters of the Apple artist's famous 
first name one by one via the brilliance of 
sundry li ghtbulbs, in a glaringly en-
tertai ning manner that has all of 
Hollywood, and certain areas of Lompoc, 
talking about it. 

Including Cha.rlie Van Dyke, who 
remarked on his morning KHJ radio 
program that, however amusing the 
blazing billboard might be, there were the 
following questions to be considered : the 
energy crisis (though it eats a miniscule 
amount of power compared to, say, the 
World Trade Center, the billboard 
nevertheless eats) and personal discomfort 
(Charlie lives near the sign and was being 
kept awake at night by its indefatigable 
resplendence) . 

So: taking all interests to heart, the 
people at Apple and Capitol decided to 

Mr. Van Dyke has expressed his ap-
proval regarding the Apple/ Capitol move. 
He counts far fewer sheep before shuffling 
off to dreamland now, thus being able to 
disperse his A .M. wit and music over 
Southern California more chirpily , More 
power to him, even if it means less going 
to Ringo's sign . 

In addition, a Strip sign heralding the 
release of the new album by Paul Mc-
Cartney and Wings, "Band on the Run," 
was planned to have been electrically 
kindled, but will instead use no such 
pyrotechnics. Yet it will glo .... in the dark, 
thanks to the wondrous properties of 
phosphorescent paint. 

In more serious efforts to curb energy 
usage, Capitol is taking several measures, 
including the following : no Christmas 
lighting, including the decoration atop the 
Tower; company signs will be turned off, 
unless necessary to safety or security; 
thermostats have been lowered; lights are 
to be turned off in unused areas; and car 
pools have been encouraged .

Christmas seems to fall upon us more suddenly each 

y ar . Well, it's that time again, the holiday season has 
arrived , and along with it a good reason to celebrate (a 
if one needed a reason!) At KSDT we' ll be celebrating 
with you from 9-10 each we kday evening during final~ 
week as "The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Life" I~ 
mysteriously transformed into the Spirit of Chri t-
mastime. We bear gifts that seem to resemble the 
following: 

MONDAY DECEMBER 3 - WHERE HAVE ALL THE 
CHIMNEYS CONE : A Christmas fantasy for grown-up 
children. Conceived by Monica Mugan and produced 
by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . 

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4 - Dinner With The 
Daedaluses : A Yuletide story of sorts, this excerpt from 
James Joyce's"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", 
begins as an almost lyric description of an old-fashioned 
Christmas dinner. But, by the final course, the occasion 
has blossomed into a full blown verbal Irish brawl. 
Whether or not you are already acquainted with them, 
you will enjoy Eleanor Sully's polished characterizations 
of Stephen, Dante, and the rest in, of course, Joyce's 
evocative language. Produced by "Pacifica Radio" . A

Anyone who thinks he 
has songwriting talent is 
being given an opportunity 
to have his music listened 
to by a prestigious and 
influential publishing 
company during the 3rd 
Annual Country Star 
Songfest conducted by 
KSON Radio . 

Fine Arts Gallery Exhibitions 

The KSON Country Star 
Songfest is a country music 
so ngwriting contest 
designed to allow all 
amateur songwriters the 
opportunity to compete 
and the winner will have hi s 
songs published by the 
House of Hits Publishing 
Company. 

A Retrospective Exhibition of 62 
Paintings by Robert Bechtle will be on 
view at the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego, 
Balboa Park December 8 through January 
20, 1974. The exhibition was organized and 
lent by the E. B. Crocker Art Gallery of 
Sacramento. 

Bechtle is a realist (although the artist 
states that he would not admit to the 
label) . Realism has survived as a sturdy, 
viable current in American painting, 
merging and reappearing in the 20th 
century in a variety of guises. Bechtle's 
subjects are inspired by photographic 
images of his personal environment 
transcribed in an equally photographic or 
precisionistic style. His people, cars and 
places retain their identities according to 
Ivan C. Karp writing in the catalog about 
the artist. "Representations of family and 
friends are more a statement of fact than a 
projection of feelings . This 'involved 
neutrality' pervades the paintings of urban 
bui Idings, bland sunshiney streets and 

empty parked cars as well . The artist's 
observation is broadly compassionate but 
free of opinion or interpretation ." 

I n add ition , The Scripps College 
Collection of American Painting, 69 
paintings given to Scripps in 1946 by 
General and Mrs. Edward Clinton Young, 
will be on view at the Fine Arts Gallery of 
San Diego, Balboa Park, December 8 
through January 20, 1974. The Youngs 
acquired their pictures during the decades 
of the twenties and thirties when General 
Young, who was a student of American art, 
set out to form a collection of one hundred 
paintings from the years 1870 to 1935 . He 
determined to begin with the painter 
George Inness and to obtain only those 
pictures which were most typical of the 
styles in which the artists he chose 
achieved success . Because of this, the 
collection gives a fine opportunity for 
study of the development of styles during 
the period . 

Entering songwriters 
should not have any 
songwriting agreements and 
all songs submitted should 
be previously unpublished . 

There is no char~e for 
entering the contest. 

Winning songs will be 
submitted to major country 
music stars for their con-
sideration to be recorded . 

All interested songwriters 
shou Id contact KSON Radio 
for an entry blank . Entry 
blanks are also avai lable at 
many music stores and 
western wear stores in San 
Diego County. 

Entry deadline is January

Scripps graduate student Richard Seymour adiusts wave 
height measuring instrument over model of tethered 
float breakwater in wave tank at the Scripps Hydraulics 
Laboratory . Model consists of 1,800 tethered, floating 
foam-plastic spheres in a 3Ox60 array. A full-scale 
prototype is to be tested next year in the Channel 
Islands. 

New Breakwater 
Concept at Scripps 
A new concept in breakwaters which may 

revolutionize harbor construction throughout the world 
was unveiled this week at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. The concept involves the use of an array 
of tethered underwater floats to dampen passing waves . 

Studies performed over the last twQ, years at Scripps 
by graduate student Richard J. Seymour suggest that the 
tethered float breakwater offers a highly effective 
means of stopping waves, at only a fraction of the cost 
and ecological impact of a conventional rock wall 
breakwater, and may also find extensive application in 
novel fields of ocean management. 

The tethered float breakwater concept grew out of 
earlier throretical work by Professor John D. Isaacs on 
the dynamics of submerged bodies which displace more 
than their own weight (and accordingly must be held 
down by a tether or some other constraining force to 
prevent their rising) . Professor Isaacs calls these " non-
Archimedean bodies." When such a body is struck by a 
pressure wave moving through the water, it is ac-
celerated in an exaggerated fashion. The pressure wave 
exerts on the non-Archimedean body the same force it 
would exert on a body of water occupying the same 
volume, but since the body is much less massive it is 

accelerated much faster than the water would have 
been. 

In the case of a tethered float being acted upon by a 
passing wave, th float do s no,l simply "roll with the 
wave" and coop!'rate in transfer/ng the wave's energy 
on down the line. Instead it first rushes ahead, pushing 
water aside, sin e it is accelerated much faster than th 
water surrounding it. Then, reaching the extent of its 
tether, it swings back the other way, like an inverted 
pendulum, working directly against the wave. Thus the 
energy imparted to the float by the wave is dissipated in 
the turbulent motion of the float working against its 
surrounding water. 

A large number of such submerged tethered floats, 
laid out in a rectangular grid, can dissipate a substantial 
portion of the ener6~ of waves trying to pass through 
them, and thus form an effective breakwater. The length 
of the tethers on the floats can be chosen so that their 
natural pendulum frequency will cause them to 
oscillate out-of-phase with waves in any desired 
frequency range. In other words, the whole breakwater 
can be " tuned" to give maximum wave-damping power 
for , say, storm waves of a characteristic frequency 
which might plaque a particular harbor. 

Whereas a conventional solid-wall breakwater simply 
reflects all waves incident upon it, the tethered-float 
design constitutes a dynamic system which capt'ures 
wave energy at that point and dissipates it as frictional 
heat . 

The advantages of the tethered-float design over solid 
rock walls are many. 

In the first place, rock-wall breakwaters are extremely 
expensive and difficult to build . The costs increase 
approximately as the square of the depth of the water 
where they built, simply because the rock must be piled 
higher to reach the surface . In depths of over fifty feet, 
rock wall breakwatprs are just not practical, if not 
impossible, to build. A tethered float breakwater, on the 
other hand, can be anchored equally well in shallow 
water or deep water, and the materials for floats and 
cables are relatively inexpensive to begin with . Seymour 
estimates that a tethered-float breakwater could be built 
for about ten percent of what a comparably effective 
solid wall breakwater would cost . 

Secondly, solid wall breakwaters tend to choke oft 
the exchange of water between the harbors they enclose 
and the ocean outside . Since harbors are generally 
depositories for large quantities of pollutants, this 
means that solid wall breakwaters, in inhibiting tidal 
flushing, can cause pollutant concentrations to reach 
high levels within the harbor. Tethered float break-
however, would be perfectly transparent to such slow 
movements of water as tidal currents, and therefore 
would not substantially affect harbor ecology . 

Ultimately, the flexibility and potential portability of 
the tethered float design may open up a whole new 
range of breakwater applications . 

For instance, in the case of a catastrophic oil spill,.a 
portable breakwater could be deployed immediatelv to 
ca lm water in the area and thus aid containment efforts. 

"Temporary" breakwaters could be anchored offshore 
from eroded beac hes to protect them from wave action 
while new sand was deposited. More generally, such 
temporary , movable breakwaters could provide a 
practical means for changing coastal ocean bottom 
topography, towards such ends as creating better 
beaches for surfing or swimmin~ . 

For harbors with only infrequent rough water, ' a 
tethered float breakwater could be stored away, for 
instance by submerging it deep enough that ships could

. UCSD Student to 
Attend Nobel Ceremonie 
Glenn Greene, a junior at Revelle Colleg!', will lw 

flying to Stockholm next week to attend the Nob I Prllt' 
ceremonies, as part of his award for wlnntng tilt' 
sweepstakes at the I nternationa I Sc ien( t> ,1Ilei 
Engineering Fair last May. Green is the first p!'r~on trolll 
San Diego to have ever won Nobel Priz triP , ~I l h " 
sponsored by the U.S. Armed Services 

Greene, who is 16, graduated from Crawford High 
School last year, and was admitted to thlrci -ytw 
standing at UCSD this year on the baSIS of ('ollt>gt' 
studies completed while he was in high school 

His prize winning project was an experimental \tueiy 
of a method for producing a controlled thermonucl!'itr 
fusion reaction initiated by laser-i nduced plasma ~ hock 
waves . The experiments were carried out In laboratorit>, 
at San Diego State last year. 

While in Stockholm, Greene and two other student, 
who won lesser awards at the fair will parti c,pate In t he 
press conference for Nobel laureates, the prizt> 
presentations, and a banquet, ball , luncheon, and 
reception for the laureates. 

Greene worked last summer at Gulf General AtomiC, 
and is currently majoring in physics and minoring In 
music at UCSD. 
drive over it, and then when bad weather threstened it 
could be raised to the surface to provide immediat 
protection against waves . Alternatively It could be 
stored on or near shore, and towed into place when 
needed . 

Such a "stowable" design is being considered for 
Avalon Harbor, which most of the time is safely in the 
lee of Catalina Island, but on about half-a-dozen days a 
year is subjE:cted to dangerous waves from the East 
raised by Santa Ana winds. A permanent solid break-
water for such an infrequent need would hardly be 
practical-but an inexpensive portable tethered float 
system might be an ideal solution. 

Richard Seymour has been conducting tests in the 
wave tank at the Scripps Hydraul ics Lab with a scale 
model tethered float breakwater (consisting of 1,800 

- one-inch foam spheres) astride a 1/ 60 scale model of 
Avalon Harbor, and the wave-damping capability 
demonstrated by this model is impressive. 

The state of California has budgeted S400,OOO for the 
construction of a prototype tethered float breakwater to 

. be tested next winter at a sti;l-to-be selected site in the 
Channel Islands. The prototype will consist of SIX to 
eight hundred spheres in an array perhaps several 
hundred feet long. This will not represent a full-scale 
breakwater for harbor protection, but it should be 
sufficient to allow an accurate appraisal of a full-sized 
version's wave-damping characteristics. 

The floats to be used for the prototype are five-foot 
hollow steel spheres, obtained in the form of avy 
surplus submarine net floats. Seymour believes that in 
the future, if construction of tethered float breakwaters 
becomes widespread, inexpensive and eas ily mass-
produced materials such as plastic and nylon will be 
used for floats and tethers . 

In addition to the California grant, the tethered float 
breakwater project is also receiving funding from the 
National Sea Grant Progiam .

Dear Santa: 

UNTITLED VIII 
This is the last week of 

school and next week brings 
up that time of year when 
suicide rates , caffeine 
consumption and cases of 
mental insanity skyrocket -
namely finals . About the 
only sport anyone is in-
terested in this time of trial 
is tryi ng to stay alive - a 
demanding task indeed 
when one gets no sleep, no 
food and no periods of 
relaxation . Of course that's 
different if you're on the 
faculty . The most en-
tertaining sports at finals 
time includes the old " toss 
the papers in the air" test to 
see which is heaviest and 
then the glee of observing 
just how many of 
California's " top 12%" can 
be given C's, D's and F's . 
But, th ings are getting off 
the subject a bit here. 

At any rate, the Untitled 
Department Staff wishes 
everyone luck in their 
efforts to stay alive, so you 
can be secure in the belief 
that SOMEON E cares, even 
if it is an entire staff of a 
department of the Sports 
page. We might also add 

by Mark Liska 
that despite how bad things 
seem, they can always get 
worse, so we suggest that 
you spend a little time 
being thankful of how well 
things are going and then 
spend a little more time 
hoping they don't get 
worse. Besides, for every 
winner in the world of 
sports, there has to be a 
loser - right? So hang in 
there , bub , and the Yancy 
Street Gang will be right 
behind you. 

We might also recom-
mend a good. study break 
comi ng up Friday and 
Saturday nites . No doubt 
most all students will be 
studying (or drinking or 
watching TV or spending 
the evening with another 
warm body or smoking a 
joint with a revolutionary) 
but a couple of students 
will be playing basketball. 
" Playing basketball?" you 
query "on the weekend 
before finals?" "Why the 
weekend before finals I'm 
studying (or drinking or 
watching TV, etc.,) on those 
important final days" . Yes 
troops, Coach Reeves will 

be leading his team in the 
USIU basketball tour-
nament being held at 
UCSD, believe it or not on 
Friday and Saturday nites 
and it should be a wor-
thwhile adventure . You 
knew things must be kind of 
hairy (How's that for a jock 
word?) since the entire 
Untitled Staff will be there 
in attendance both nites. 
Anyway, it should be worth 
your time and effort to 
attend the game, besides if 
you're lucky you'll run into 
someone from the Untitled 
Department and be able to 
get- a free autograph . 

Speaking of Christmas, 
the Untitled Department 
decided to give a little help 
to some departments 
around here who are kind of 
bashful about asking Santa 
Claus what to give them for 
Christmas. Therefore, we 
decided to draft a letter to 
Santa and put it right here 
so Santa would be sure to 
see it the next time he's on 
campus . 

Dear Santa,

It all happened ... 

Joey Meets "J" Sunday 
It all happened last 

Wednesday afternoon . I 
was walking by the gym and 
noticed a coed football 
game being played on the 
field next to the pool. Being 
the interested sports fan 
that I am, I wandered on 
over and watched the 
game . Very soon after 
another game started, and 
as soon as the first game 
was over you rs tru Iy 
proceeded to watch the end 
of t he second game. 

With about five minutes 
left in that game I hap-
pened to run into my boss, 
the sports editor, who duly 
informed me that I was to 
write an article on the two 
games that I had just 
witnessed . So herewith, 
with apologies to those 
people who played whose 
names I either don't know 
or will proceed to misspell. 

As it turned out the two 
games that I had observed 
were the coed footba II 
semifinal playoffs . The first 
game pitted Judy Lower and 
the "J's" against Contact 
Inhibition . It was truly an 
amazing game as the j's 
would score on a bomb 
from their quarterback (a 
guy named Faupell) to none 
other than Judy Lower. CI 
would then come right back 
and score to tie the game 
up. 

When I first arrived at the 
game the score was 12-6 in 
favor of the J's. Not to be 
outdone CI came on to 
score the tying touchdown 
on a pass from Frank 
Vernon to Laurie Davis. 
This brought about the 
most amazing series of 
plays that anyone has ever 
seen in the annals of UCSD 
coed football. 

Contact Inhibition had to 
punt from their own twenty 
with less than 2 minutes left 
in the game. On the first 
play of their series ' the J's 
Judy Lower caught a pass 
that was tipped by the 
defender and took it in for a 
TD. 

Down by six points with 
only a minute and a half left 
to play, CI was not to be 
denied as they drove sixty 
yards to score on the last 
play of the game on a great 
catch by Laurie Gage. This 
drive was aided by 
numerous pena lties by the 
J's and high lighting the 
drive was a long pass from 
QB Vernon to Laurie Gage. 
As was the case on all the 
other TD's in the game the 
conversion failed, sending 
the game into one of those 
infamous tiebreakers . 

As was the case during 
the rest of the game, one 
person made the difference 
in the tiebreaker, Judy 
Lower. On the first play, she 
made an unbelievable 
catch of a Faupell pass and 
went in for a touchdown, 
icing the game for the j's 2S-
18. 

The other playoff was a 
tight defensive game, Dick 
Duncan and " Joey 
Amalphitano" (that'shis 
teams name) taking on 
Plutz's C1utzes . The game 
was decided in the first half 
as Patty (Never could figure 
out her last name) outraced 
the Clutzy defenders tohaul 
in a Duncan pass for the 
score . 

The second half featured 
a tight defense by "Joey" as 
they managed to choke off 
every Clutz rally on fine flag 
pulling by Val and an ex-
cellent pass rush that forced 
the Clutz QB into some 
hurried throws . The final 
score was 6-0 in favor of 
"Joey" . 

" Joey" and the "J's" will 

meet for the championship 
this Sunday while Off and 
the Baboons wi ll vie for the 
men 's championship on 
Monday. 

Ruggers Blast 
SD State TWice; 
Face Tourneys 

Two weekends ago UCSD 
tested its newly found 
rugby ta lent against CSU 
San Diego (a lias San Diego 
State) and came out on top 
twice 22-4 and 17-{J. 

On this drizzly day many 
hopefuls gained notice , 
while many veterans 
showed how they had 
improved their games. 

Among the outstanding 
newcomers was ex-Stan ford 
rugger, Scott Boughton, 
who demonstrated his 
explosive running abilities 
by blowing gaping holes in 
State's backs to score . 

More hard running was 
displayed by Andy "H it and 
Run" Jones as he showed 
time and time again that 
the easies way to the goal 
line was over a few State 
defenders. 

Yet all of the glory was 
not captured by the 
newcomers alone as Dick 
Ostrup, after three years of 
hard work, finally perfected 
the dummy pass to make an 
easy score (either that or he 
fi nally fou nd someone 
dumb enough to go for his 
fake) .

Cagers Face Oky 
In Opener Tonight 

The UCSD Basketball Team opens its 1973-74 season 
tonight at 6 p.m. against Occidental College in the 
UCSD main gymnasium . The game will b the first of 
two in the opening round of the USIU Clas ic Tour-
nament . 

The 8 p.m. game will pi t host school USIU against al 
Lutheran , with th winning teams playing at 8 p.m. 
tomorrow and the 10 rs at (, p.m . 

This year's Triton team has a plethora of excellent 
shooters led by All Southern California Center Paul 
Trainer , who averaged 10 e to 20 points and 12 
rebounds per game last s ason . 

Other fine scorers are Steve Higgins from last year's 
squad ; Mark Read, last year's leading freshman scorer ; 
Steve Kircher, who averaged 15 points a game at Canada 
JC last year ; and Joe Coit, previous Most Valuable Player 
at Riverside C. 

George Calhoun, one of the finest JC guards in 
Southern California will also be joining the team aft r 
the first few games. 

The Tritons figure to feature a fast-break oHense and 
a pressing defense, which should lead to some fine high 
scoring games . Teamwork has been an outstanding 
fetaure on this year's squad and this week's tournament 
should be a real test and provide good basketball here at 
UCSD. 

With all of these points in their favor, all the team 
really needs is som support from the students. So come 
out this weekend and see some fine basketball.

Meanwhi le, as the backs 

were showing off their 
moves, veteran forward 
Frank "Gyro" Barnes 
revealed some of the moves 
that earned hi m his 
nickname, as he cat-danced 
through State's defence for 
an easy try. 

And another rooseforward 
displayed his natural rugby

"Grabby" Gonzales would 
not leave the ball alone no

These thoughts were 
echoed by Mr. Kirkman 
who stated ;tudent 
representation must be 
insured. (Perhaps) they 
(students) should rule on 
teaching ability?" 

Upeaking for the 
American Association of 
University Professors 
(AAUP) was Kier Nash, a 
political scientist at UCSB.: 
A fairly accurate guage of 
their position is this 
statement, made by Mr. 
Nash, " (With regards to 
academic personnel) the 
place for students is 
peripheral at best. Faculty 
should be judged by their 
peers, by th is I mean, the 
senior members of their 
department ." Mr . Nash 
seemed to be representing 
their position as a " justified 
elitism."

and their spokesman at the 
conference was Professor 
David Feller of Bolt Hall . He 
(speaking for the IFA) sees 
collecti .ve bargaining 
simply as a process for 
economic gain-salary 
improvement and fringe 
benefits. His attempt would 
be to remove the sul:r 
stantive issues from the 
collective bargaining 
mechanism ; to allow 
student input to remain as it 
is , through the Senate 
committees; and to keep 
collective bargaining to a 
tight bipartite negotiation 
between union and ad-
ministration represe n-
tatives. 

As t he co nference 
progressed it became clear 
that very little compromise 
would come of any 
discussion between the 
unions. They all envision a

R? tines within Safeway would be disrupted. Such 
considerations are serious, but not comparable in 
ma.nitude or impact to the ongoing" injustice to ap-
proximately 15,000 lettuce workers and tens of 
thousands more farm workers who cannot freely 
organize with the current precedent of grower selection 
of a union . 

In a climate of doubt about corporate responsibility, 
and with young people establishing lifetime buying 
habits, Safeway has an important opportunity to 
contribute to the society and to its own image. The 
alternative is further alienation from centers of cor-
porate power which cannot respond to the poor . I hope 
this report receives serious consideration from Safeway 
and that the company is able to respond with vision to 
the crisis at hand .

approached him con-
cerning the grading of my

was, " Debbie, go jump in

personal insult, I DEMAND

One of the saving graces 
of this God-forsaken land 
was the joy of wandering 
through the woods on the 
way from Muir Campus to 
the Central Library. The 
trees were the greatest and 
last testimony to the natural 
grace and dignity human 
beings miRht be capable of. 
At this present fateful time 
the hopeful image has been 
totally shattered : a virgin 
forest has been rudely 
raped by the devastation of 
bulldozers , fellers, and 
hole-diggers. The trees are 
shrieking and cryi ng out

A lover of life. 

To Rude 
Honkey 

Dear Rude Honky: 
I realize that your 

consciousness is at such a 
low level that all you can 
deal with is insignifi cant 
actions as the one that took 
place Friday, November 16. 

Let us explain to you 
exactly where your con-
sciousness is. You seem not 
to realize the pettiness 
involved in such an act in 
comparison to the rudeness 
of the American system 
(white) . It seems that all 
you can deal with is 
worthless, social norms. (1) 
Why didn ' t you wait 

~atiently Friday night in 
line while you witnessed 
injustice. I, like many other 
Blacks, have heard your 
bullshit and stood in line for 
300 years and I am still 
waitin g for you rude 
honkies to stop jumping in 
line in front of me to let me 
through the door. If you sti ll 
don't understand what I am 
referring to let us break it 
down for you even further. 

In dealing with the 
educational system, and 
this University (ha), we 
(blacks) are only here 
because our parents have 
waited in line by working 
their asses off the way you 
told them to work their way 
to the front of the line. 
However, you rude honkies 
kept jumping in front of 
them so they (parents) are 
still at the end of the line. 
The same thing (your at-
titude) is now happening to 

injustice. 
You said it was chi ldish 

for the Black women to 
scream every time they saw 
Billie Dee Williams. Let me 
point out to you how 
childish it was for white 
men to rape Black women 
and abandon them, to use 
them like animals . Let us 
scr~am and holler at all the 
fine black men we see!! 

When innocent Blacks let 
their blackness show, they 
are put down by the 
American system and 
pushed to the back of the 
line after waiting in line 
patiently. 

let me mention to you 
sweet mouthed honkies 
who have commercials and 
advertisements showing 
whites as being beautiful 
and sexy while 
simultaneously, calli ng 
blacks inferior, ugly, im-
moral and uncultured. 

Have you considered the 
real reason you are 50 upset 
over the whole situation? Is 
it just because the 50 called 
rude individuals w ere 
black? If so, have you at-
tended any other movies 
this year or last year? I f you 
have, I'm sure you'd wit-
ness, like I and many others 
have, that most people 
(majority white) who do 
attend th e UCSD movies in 
the gym act according to 
your criteria, childish and 
rude. Paper planes are 
thrown and hissing and 
whistling are all par for the 
course of attending movies 
and concerts at UCSD. 

So, who is really 
privileged and pamperedr 

This is really what is 
going on around here .

C.ont.- from P. 3 

"Fine, Robert . You' ll get a 
bonus. Goodnight." 

George slammed down 
the phone and danced into 
the dining room _ 

"Now George," Marsha 
demanded, "what's going 
onl" 

" Did you know · thaI 
stomach gas burns?" 

Marsha looked disgusted 
" That's right," Santa 

prattled , "i t burns , 
Methane, you know. Sort of 
a back-to-nature natural 
gas, ha-hal The good 01' 
Bronx cheer I") He put a 
hand to his mouth and 
made it clearer. Then he 
grabbed the pork and 
beans. "Got any more, 
love?" 

"Um , just another can, I 
think ." 

'Well , get it cooking. I'll 
get us some more. Bronx 
cheer city, here I come!" 

He brought the phone to 
the table and got the 
operator to connect him 
with leo Lumer, the Pur· 
chasing agent. 

" Hello, Mr . Lumer's 
office . Gwen speaking." 

" let me speak to Leo. 
This is Santa ." 

" Yes, sir." 
" Leo? I want you to go 

out and buy about f ive 
cases or pork and beans. 
We're going to make the 
trip after all ." 

"That's great, sir! I' ll get 
them immediately." 

"Oh, Leo. Round up 
about ten or so of you elves 
that like pork and beans 
and send 'em oiler to the 
house." 

"MA Y I ask why, sir?" 
"Well, I really don't have 

time to explain , but 
everyone involved wili get a 
bonus ." 

" Si r can I tell the elves 
th e g~od news?" 

"Sure," Santa agreed. 
George Claus heard Leo 

shout out that Santa wou ld 
be making the trip after all 

" Let's hear three cheers 
for Santa l" Leo yelled. 

Santa had to grin at that 
one. " I t' li take more than 
three," he chuckled . 

"Sir?" Lumer asked, " I 
couldn't quite hear you ." 

"Nothing," Santa replied, 
swallowing the last of the 
beans , " nothing at all ."
