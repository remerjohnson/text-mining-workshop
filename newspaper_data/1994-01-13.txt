SANTA BARBARA - Both 
sides of the Santa Barbara 
legal system are gearing up 
for the deluge of court cases 
that have arisen from Hallow-
een arrests in Isla Vista. 
"They're starting to trickle in 
now," said Ann Sullivan, an 
attorney at the Santa Barbara 
District Attorney's Office. 
"So far there hasn't been a 
big glut on the system." 
According to Public Defender 
Rick Barron, defense attor-
neys will try to raise ques-
tions about the'details of each 
case. "It appears to me thnt 
the [officers'] marching order 
was to seek a group of people 
standing together and pick 
one of those people of the 
group and arrest them," 
Barron said.

State Audit 
Finds Misuse 
Of Funds 
REPORT: 1\vo ex-employees 
misappropriated over $40,000 
from student outreach program 
By Philip Mlc ...... 
News Editor 
and .lonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

Two former UCSD employees misappro-
priated at least 512,680 from a campus stu-
dent outreach program, according to a report 
released by the state Auditor General's Office 
on Tuesday. 

The report found that the director and an 
administrative assistant of the San Diego Stu-
dent Opportunity and Access Program (SOAP) 
billed the university for falsified payroll and 
mileage claims totaling over $40,000. Of the 
total, the two employees misappropriated at 
least 512,680 for personal profit, Auditor 
General Kurt Sjoberg said. 

In a statement released on Tuesday, cam-
pus officials said that they "concurred" with 
the Auditor General'afindiop. 

Maria L Sima lervod as the director of 
SOAP until her resignation last September. 
While the Auditor General did not release the 
names of the two employees, the report did 
say that the accused directOr and administra-
tive 'assistant left the univenity in the fall. 

"The university is not confirming or deny-
ing names," said Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Services Carmel Myers: 

SOAP is a university-sponsored outreach 
program that provides information about 
higher education to high school seniors. The 
program also provides tuton for local pri-
mary and secondary schools. 

The report said that the director of SOAP 
misappropriated more than $6,000 for her 
personal profit by writing checks to herself 
and her husband from a secret bank account 
and by falsifying reimbursement claims. 

The administrative assistant misappropri-
ated more than $6,585, according to the Audi-
tor General's report, by falsifying payroll 
documents, forging signatures on payroll 
checks and forging SOAP's endorsement on 
checks from other organizations. 

The remaining money cited in the report 
consisted of unearned payments to seven stu-
den .. , (alsified payroll checks, unaccounted 
petty Cash, unauthorized payments, false mile-
age claims, a secret bank account and non-
program expenses. 

Myen said that it was not known at what 
time the misappropriation of funds took place. 
However, she speculated that it probably oc-
curred within the 18 months preceding the 
auditor's investiption. 

Accordina to Myen, the university is con-
. ductin, an internal audit on the SOAP pr0-

gram. The audit will be completed within the 
next two to four weeks, she IBid. 

Followina the release of that audit, Myers 
said that the univenity will confer with ita 
attorneys to decide whether or not to file 
char .. &pinst the two employees. 

Sjobcra said that it was the responsibility 
of the .... Attorney General or the San D1eao 
District Attorney to file criminal charaes

Constitution Authors Explain 
Differences in New Document 
DEBATE: Monday night meeting 
marked by heated arguments 
over A.S. convention procedure 

bate, the convention reconvened, and con-
stitution co-author and A.S. Director of 
Development Wally Lockwood briefed 
members on changes in' the new constitu-
tion. 

By Alex ...... r Th ...... 
Staff Writer 

The proposed Associated Students consti-
tution was outlined by one of its authors at last 

According to authors Lockwood and Com-
missioner of Academic Affairs David Valen-
tine, three main changes have been proposed 
within the new constitution. 

Monday's constitutional con-
vention meeting, but not be-
fore heated arguments broke 
out in an early recess. 

During the recess, former 
A.S. Vice President External 
Siamak Malek, who is the 
convention's chair pro tem, 
brought up concerns about 
the protocol ,being used to 
construct the new constitu-
tion, 

Malek has proposed a new 
structure for running the con-
vention that would allow the 
general public greater partici-
pation in the process. 

"We are here to discuss 
and plan out [a constitution], 
not review a piece of legisla-
tion and pass it .... We're here 
to create something new," 
Malek said. 

He added that A.S. mem-
ben have an advantage over 
members of the public in cre-
ating a new document be-
eaule of their knowledge of 
parliamentary procedure and 
"legalese" language. 

"Many ofua have no ex-
perience with a constitution, 
and we are beina asked to 

"We are here

We',. ..... . 

First, the executive members 
will now consist of two vice 
presidents and a president in-
stead of three vice presidents 
and the president. Lockwood 
said that eliminating one vice 
president position will help 
streamline the council. 

Second, the commissioners 
will have a clear division of 
tasks and will no longer be 
elected to office or hold vot-
ing powers on the A.S, Coun-
cil. 

This wiJI allow commission-
ers to devote more time to their 
jobs and less time to A.S. Coun-
cil procedures, in which they 
often do not need to participate, 
Lockwood said. 

Finally, the Judicial Board 
will gain more independence 
from the A.S. Council and have 
greater jurisdiction over student 
affairs . 

Currently, the Judicial Board 
falls under the'purview of the 
A.S. Council.

like his cycling journeys, " it's ba-

"lfyou think ofa specific goal," 
said Roberts, "then everything be-
tween here and there is an ob-

About 100 corpora tions are 
funding the project. With the goal 
of comple ting the praft by the end 

of next year, Rob-
erts is enlisting the 
aid of ove r 20 
UCSD students 
who are working 
for credit. In addi-

about 50 people

Roberts, whose 

Nomadic Research 
Lecturer, Inventor 

Lab is now housed in the engi-
neering building, is in the first 
stages of constructing a waterborne 
version of his high-Iech bicycle. 

The craft, dubbed the Sea Moss 
Microship, is a 30-foot-long, 1.5-
ton hull sandwiched between two 
detachable kayaks. The center hull, 
which houses the craft's custom-
designed computers, communica-
tion equipment and sleep area, is 
being designed by Nelson/Marek, 
the San Diego design firm that 
created the Stars and Stripes cata-
maran. 

In addition to its sail, the 
microship has propellors which

"I don't like having to depend 

on resources that I won't always 
be able to get [e.g. gasoline]," 
Roberts said. Natural energy such 
as wind, sun and food are always 
available, he added. 

Roberts said that he will most 
likely use the microship to travel 
in small waterways rather than the 
open ocean. However, he said that

Like the BEHEMOTH, the 

microship will utilize a number of 
powerful computers for systems oon-
trol, navigation, writing and e-mail. 

In addition, the workstation-
on-water will be able to collect 
environmental samples each hour 
for analysis of radiation, acidity, 
temperature and other factors. This 
data will be stored in a large data-
base which students and others 
will be able to access from remote 
locations. 

"The point is that computers 
are simply windows," said Rob-
erts. "Communication is what's 
really important." 

To help him keep in touch with 
other users, Roberts will use sys-
tems similar to those employed on 
the BEHEMOTII: a satellite hook-
up, cellular phone with modem 
and fax, and full ham radio. 

Over the course of his journey 
on the BEHEMOTH, Roberts col-
lected 811 electronic network, or 
" hospitality database," of about 
5,000 people.

Engineers to Study Earthquake Safety 
I A team of structural engineers from UCSO has 

been awarded two grants totaling $3.4 million to 
create new design methods for building earthquake-
resistant bridges. 

The three-year grants, from the Califomia DepartÂ· 
ment of Transportation, will be used to investigate 
altemative techniques that could be used to improve 
bridge strength and flexibility. 

Â· We'li take a look at what has been done in seismic 
design in the past,Â· said Structural Engineering Pro-
fessor Nigel Priestley. Â·We'li tJy to determine whether 
or not there are better ways of conceptualizing how 
structures should perform In earthquakes to reduce 
damage In moderate earthquakes and avoid extreme 
cases of damage with major earthquakes.Â· 

To accomplish these tasks, Priestley and fellow 
Structural Engineering Professor Frieder Selble will 
direct a team from UCSO's Charles Lee Powell StrucÂ· 
tures Laboratory that wlii Include two postdoctoral 
engineers, a research engineer and about 10 graduate 
students. 

Under the grants, the UCSD researchers willinves-
tigate about 10 areas where design could be simplI-
fied or performance could be improved. 

These latest Caitrans grants follow a successful 
research project in which UCSD stnJctural engineers 
developed techniques for the state transportation 
agency to retrofit older bridges. More than 500 bridges 
statewide have been strengthened since the October 
1989 loma Prieta earthquake, most employing de-
signs and methods developed at UCSD. 

Researchers under the new Caltrans grant will work 
closely with engineers involved with the proposed 
landmark 450-foot highway bridge over Interstat~5 
built from lightweIght composite materials. The bridge 
project recently was awarded $10.5 million In federal 
funds through a program aimed at helping the nation's 
defense industry convert Its technologies to peace-
time uses.

Students React Angrily 
To Governor's Budget 
PROPOSAL: Probable 
$620 fee increase raises 
ire of undergraduates 
By M_ry Beth ...... k 
Staff Writer 

.Gov. Pete Wilson's 1995.bud-
get proposal. which was an-
nounced last .week, has pushed 
some UCSD students and their 
pocketbooks over the edge by 
making fee hikes virtually un~ 
avoidable. 

The governor's budget calls for 
a $58 million increase in state fund-
ing for the University of Califor-
nia. However, this 3.2 percent in-
crease won't cover the 8.8 percent 
hike in funding asked for by the 
UC Board of Regents. To cover 
the shortfall between the UC's 
needs and the governor's proposal, 
the UC Office of the President wiD 
ask the regents to approve a $620 
fee increase for undergraduates 
and a $2,000 fee hike for first-year 
students at the UC professional 
schools. 

Many students resent the prob-
able fee increases and are worried 
about the repercussions that the 
hikes could have. 

") feel that Gov. Wilson needs 
to realize bow important higher 
education is to Cal ifomia 's future, n 
said Revelle College senior 
Stephanie Cobb. ") blame Gov. 
Wilson for the fee hikes because 
he's the one responsible for allo-

eating the money." 
Muir College freshman Cynthia 

Gutierrez said she isconcernedwith 
the effect that fee increases will 
have on students from lower-in-
come families. "I think it lowen 
the opportunities of low-income 
students. They should concentrate 
on defense cuts and stay out of 
education money." 

"This increase will have a nega-
tive impact on many low- and 
middle-class families," said Fifth 
College freshman Stanley Currier. 
" It ' s sad to know that Gov. Wilson 
is malting education less acces-
sible, especially because educa-
tion is the key to solving many of 
the problems that we are wasting 
funds on today." 

Some, like Revelle College stu-
dent Mathew Lopatka, consider 
the fee hikes a necessary measure 
and aren't upset by the budget 
proposal. "I'm not in favor of [fee 
hikes], but I think that students 
have more of an obligation to their 
education than the taxpayers," 
Lopalka said. 

Revelle' College junior Scott 
Goode disagreed, saying, "It seems 
to me that the state should be more 
focused on higher education than 
on some of its other programs," 
Goode said. "Why is it that I, who 
go to a public institution in the 
State of California, pay more than 
a friend that goes to an out-of-state 
school? It looks like we're becom-
ing privatized. n

Then, said Roberts, a friend 
turned him on to the sport of sea-
kayaking. This new hobby gave 
Roberts the idea for the microship.

Wilson Budget is Good 
Politics, Bad Policy 

As he does every January, the governor has released his budget 
proposal for the next fiscal year. And like his past proposals, Gov. 
Pete Wilson's 1995 budget has raised the ire of ma(1Y Califor-
nians, particularly students at the University of California. 

At first glance, Wilson appears to have given the UC system . 
an uncharacteristic break. His budget calls for a $58 million boost 
in state funding to the university, a 3.2 percent increase from last 
year. That's the first increase in state funding for the University 
of California in four years and the first one Wilson has seen fit to 
bestow on us during his tenure as governor. 

University officials were ecstatic. UC President Jack Peltason 
praised the governor for his sagacity, saying "We are very 
grateful to the governor for his proposal. The 3.2 percent increase 
represents the best outcome possible given the state's fiscal 
situation and the increasing demands on state funds." While 
heaping praise upon the governor, Peltason forgot to mention that 
the 3.2 percent increase was far short of the 8.8 percent hike the 
university needed to balance its budget. 

But that's what students are for, after all. To meet the shortfall, 
UC students will have to weather a $620 fee hike. First-year 
students at UC's professional schools will face a $2,000 increase 
in fees. And even more university employees will flee this sinking 
ship by taking early retirement. 

Of course, if the governor's figures are not accurate when the 
Legislature votes on the budget, things will be made much worse. 
Wilson has based his entire budget proposal on a pretty risky 
gamble - he has asked for $2.3 billion in aid from the federal 
government to reimburse California for education and health care 
provided to illegal immigrants. Without that $2.3 billion, Wilson 
said "we would have to make decisions that nobody wants to 
make." 

To give you an idea of how likely Wilson's fantasy is, last year 
the state asked for $1.45 billion in federal aid. California wound 
up receiving just $324 million. 

Wilson's gamble reeks of odious election-year politics. Be-
cause he hopes to get reelected, the governor finds himself unable 
to raise taxes or cu t spending. But since the state fiscal year begins 
on July 1, while the federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, Wilson 
is able to base his budget on a billion dollar fantasy. By the time 
the federal government gets around to rejecting California's 
request for $2.3 billion in aid, the gubernatorial elections will 
probably be long over. If Wilson is reelected, he can slash the 
budget without any fear ofvoterretaliation. Ifhe loses, well , then 
the new governor will be stuck with the tab. 

This is an ingenious way to play politics, but a lousy way to get 
a floundering state back on track. Wilson is holding the State of 
California hostage for his own political gain, and for that reason 
alone, this budget proposal is the most wretched he has made 
during his four wretched years in office. 

Constitutional Convention 
Lost to Usual Silliness 

Like a drunkard at his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, 
the UCSD Associated Students has been able to admit that it has 
a problem. Our troubled student representatives just can't seem to 
stop debating petty bylaws and fighting amongst themselves. 

It started out innocently enough. A few years back, student 
leaders were able to overstep a useless constitution and actually 
solve a few problems, suffering only from occasional bouts of 
infighting. But the wretched constitution finally caught up with 
the councilmembers, who have since lost effectiveness. 

Over the last year, the A.S. wised up and admitted that the 
constitution was unworkable by caDing for a constitutional con-
vention. Along the way, however, something went horribly 
wrong. Students who wanted to submit a constitution for consid-
eration were not given proper notice, and the 10th week of Fall 
Quarter was left for students to draw up an entire constitution. As 
a result, only one constitution was submitted to a convention ... 
doesn't even bave tbe power to make cbanges before approviii 
or rejecting the document. In addition, the constitution doesn't 
provide any remedy to the petty debates that wract the council. 

The same inefficiency that plagues normal A.S. meetinp bas 
struck the convention - Monday's meetioa bepa with â€¢ balf-
boar sbou .... matc:b. Clearly, the current convention will give us 
DOth'", but more petty debate.

COMMENTARY: Western democracies must start practicing what they preach by respecting international law and hwnan rights 

ONE LAw FOR US, ANOTHER FOR THEM 

ANDREW 

REynOLDS 
WORlD 

VIEW 

It bas long been 
apparent that some 
national govern-
ments play by a 
completely differ-
ent set of rules than 
the rest of us. They 
do not seem to be 
bound by the COIl-
straints of interna-
tional law, Juunan 
rights and basic de-
cency. But the cul-
prits are not always 
the despotic regimes 
which often spring 
to mind when inter-

national terrorism and covert action are men-
tioned (e.g. Iran, libya and Iraq). Some of the 
worst offenders are the very Western govern-
ments which base their mandates on the prin-
ciples of liberal democracy and freedom. 

I was reminded of this by the intriguing case 
of Major Alain Mafart, wbowas promoted to the 
position of lieutenant colonel by the French 
government last week. In 1985, as the leader of 
a FrCncb Secret Agent team, he carried out 
orders to destoy the Greenpeaoe ship Rainbow 
Warrior in a New Zealand harbor. The French 
government was furious that Greenpeace wu 
protesting its usc of islands in the South Pac:ific 
as nuclear testing grounds, so it decided to stop 
them by destroying one of its vessels and, in the 
procas, murderinga Greenpeaoe photographer. 
When it was clear who was responsible tor the 
bombing. the public outcry was so great that the 

French government agreed to 
give two agents 10-year prison 
sentences. 

Despite the appalling na-
lure of this governmental 
crime, Major Mafart served 
only two of his 10-year sen-
tence and Captain Prieur (his 
co-conspiralor) was released 
in 1989 after deliberately be-
comingpregnanL It'sclearthat 
the French government had 
lillie coaoem for international 
law when it carried out the 
attaclt and its subsequent ac-
tions. First, it pardoned the 
guilty and later by promoting 
them. 

But the French are not alone 
in the 1J5C.0f covert and illegal 
methods. Over the last year, 
there has been an enonnous 
clamor for the release of 
Jonathan Pollard. Before he 
was caught and convicted Pol-
lard spent many years spying 
on the United States and NATO 
for the government of Israel. 
Jewish groups, Zionist organi-
zatiom and even YitzakRabin, 
the prime minister of Israel, 
have called on President 

The French 
.ovem .... ntwa

Gr_npeace wu

of Its v .... I .. 

infonnation stolen by Pollard 
and transmitted to the Israeli 
government eventually 1anded 
in Russian hands, leading to 
the deaths of many U.S. agents 
working in the Soviet Union. 
As such, Pollard's betrayal 
was not just one of paper and 
ideas, but of substantial dam-
age to the lives and interests of 
Americans abroad. 

What makes this case even 
more odd -and the actions of 
the Israelis even more repre-
hensible - is that the govern-
ment of Israel was spying on 
the very country which 
propped up its foundations, 
both economically and diplo-
matically.1f Israel had the au-
dacity to abuse international 
law in its dealings with the 
United States, then how would 
it behave toward countries -
and people - less favorable 
to its existence? 

I would like to think that 
the United States is above sucb 
duplicity, international terror-
ism and covert action, but the 
historical evidence seems to 

Ointon to release Pollard from his prison sen-
tence which began in 1987. In rejecting these 
caUs. the President has referred to Central Intel-
Iigence Agcw;;y (CIA) evidence that sensitive 

suggest the contrary. Since the 
end of World War U, American security agen-
cies have been involved in c:ountIess acts of 
state-sponsered violence. The 1970's House 
Committee Investigation into Assassinations 

found that succasive presidents bad approved 
increasingly bizarre plots to assassinate Fidel 
Castro as well as other Latin American leaders 
of whom the U.S. government disapproved. 
However, one of the most outrageous abuses of 
U.S. power in Central America was the massaÂ· 
cre of the Salvadoran village of EI Mozote by 
U.S.-trained military forces. This shameful epi-
sode, recently highlighted in The New York 
Times, wascompoundedbythefactlhat the U.S. 
government attempted to cover up the murders 
and denied all knowledge of them until they 
were exposed. 

Some of the illegal actions taken by Western 
democracies seem to have been accepted as 
inevitable by-products of real poIiti/c. However, 
if we cannot trust liberal democracies to respect 
human rights and international law, who can we 
trust? It is terribly hypocritical when these gov-
ernments condemn Third World regimes for 
abusing their people; while at the same time, 
they are carrying out acts of violence and terror-
ism. 

It is time for the U.S., French, British, Israeli 
and other democratic governments to begin 
practicing what they preach and respect the 
sovereignty of aU nations and different ways of 
thinking. For too long the advocates of "liberty, 
fraternity and democracy" have slipped into 
cynicism when it serves their needs. A good 
starting point would be for the United States to 
resist Israeli caUs fQl' the release of Jonathan 
Pollard and to never again involve itself in 
covert actions to destabilize democratically 
elected governments of neighboring states. Per-
haps then we can hope stop abuses elsewhere.

OONVENIION: 
Student input and 
participation needed 
ContInued from ..... 4 
executives wuld speedily paIS their 
own conceptioo ofwbat the oonstitu-
tion should be. Their plans were 
crusbed when they failed to get re-
elected, leaving council with. deeply 
flawed constitutional convention. 

Perhaps you are WOIIdering about 
the "proposed constitutions" which 
are cunently under review. Due to the 
A.S.', extensive publicity campaign 
to get a well-rounded conection of 
proposals, the constitutional conven-
tion has OM "proposed constitution," 
The singular proposal was written by, 
you guessed it, two current AS. Coun-
cil members. Notable of the two is 
Wallace (Wally) V. Lockwood III, 
the same Wally Lockwood who pro-
posed that the AS. cuJ funding/or all 
student organizations, except for 30-
day loans to be repaid through student 
bake sales and the like. 

Wally aside, what's missing from 
this picture? Well, for starters, a con-
stitutional convention. The conven-
tion happened when Wally and cohort 
Dave Valentine wrote the only "pr0-
posed constitution. " The current pro-
ceedings simply provide the rubber 
stamp. 

What can be dooe about this? Wen, 
the cunent constitutional convention 
memberscancometotheralhersimple 
conclusion that the pfOCf'A"dinp are 
Hawed. They oouId then draft a logi-
cal, rational - and dare I say -
democraticorderfortheconstitutionaf 
convention. The AS. Council cooId 
then ratify the proposal. This, how-
ever, is unlikely. 

The majority of the people who 
show up to the constitutional oonven-
tion meetings are Council members. 
And as a recent meetin& illustrates, 
convention members~the bureau-
cratic culture: they are reportedly as-
signing tbelJl5Clves numbers to aid in 
roll caU ("Number six .... Yes, here, 
number two .... j. 

The only way to make this con-
vention useful, the only way to de-
mocratize it, is if students and student 
organizations get involved. Come to a 
meeting. Get ahold of your A.S. rep-
resentatives and tell them you are 
concemed.Givethemsomenewideas 
of what to do. 

I have my own proposals for how 
the constitutional convention should 
proceed. It's simple, really. First you 
examine the problem (i.e. AS. bu-
reaucratic gridlock) and set up simple 
parameters and goals for a new ClOD- . 
stitution to meet. Then do research 
(something many councilmembers 
seem oblivious to) into various mod-
els of organization, such as existing 
associations, unions and cooperatives 
on other campuses. 

This can be done very efficiently 
and effectively by dividing up the SO-
some person convention into smaU 
groups of two or three and lISigning 
one piece to each group. The constitu-
tional convention would then review 
the accumulated documents and di-
vide them up into three orfourgroups. 
Each group would include documents 
and models that are based on some 
oommon organizational idea. The 
oonventioomembershipwoulddivide 
into a COiiesponding number of com-
mittees. Each committee would write 
a constitution from the given group of 
documents, aeating the best possible 
constitutional model for UCSD with 
that basic idea. 

Now we have several proposed 
solutions Ioourproblem. The last step 
is to pick the best solution. And that 
IbouId be. democratic decision of the 
student body.

UCSD's 
prestig ious 

festival 
expands its 
horizons ina 
ninth season 

O nce again, UCSD's International Style Film Festival, which began yesterday with a showing of Michael 
Apted's Blink, will steer clear of 
any conscious thematic focus and 
instead offer an array of cultural 
films that deal with a variety of 
human experiences. 

By selecting films from coun-
tries such as Mexico, Korea, Aus-
tria, France, Armenia and Russia, 
this series will most likely offer a 
twist to the predictable stories of 
American life churned out year af-
ter year by the Hollywood film in-
dustry. Since only three of the more 
than 30 films are from the United 
States, the subject matter and styles 
of filmmaking will supply more 
novel perspectives and hopefully 
some unique messages. 

In comparison to last year's se-
ries, the film list has grown in quan-
tity and diversity (encompassing 
more countries), and it also includes 
a special evening of short films on 
May 3 which will premiere Jim 
Jarmusch's (Mystery Train, Night 
on Earth) new film "Coffee and 
Cigarettes" and Daryl Hannah'sdi-
rec(orial debut, "The Last Supper." 

This will also be the first ye~r in 
which the audience will have a 
chance to vote for the film it thinks 
is the best itt the end of the season. 
The winning film will receive a

"patron's award." 

Another addition to the festival 
will be the increased number of 
guest appearances. Director 
Michael Aptcd appeared at last 
night's opening of Blink, and Hilary 
Henkin, a popular new figure in 
Hollywood who wrote and pro-
duced Romeo is Bleeding (Feb. 1), 
will attend the screening and disÂ· 
cuss her film. Romeo is a dark 
comedy which stars Gary Oldman, 
Lena Olin and Juliette Lewis. Fes-
tival organizers are still finalizing 
other appearances. 

The success ofttiis event during 
the past eight years has made these 
changes possible and has made the 
International Style Film Festival 
one of UCSD's most prestigious 
cultural events. Every film shown 
this year is a San Diego premiere, 
and 14 are American premieres. 

Each year since its inception, 
the festival's Â¢rowd has grown and 
diversified. Ruth Baily, coordina-
tor of the festival, explained that 
the initial objective of the series 
has shifted from presenting !ie(:. 
ond-run foreign films to offering a 
selection of San Diego premieres 
which are considered to represent 
"the best from their country." 

Baily said that the two main 

~ay,JaDuary13,l993 

criteria in the film selection pro-
c:eu are to show the most interest-
ing film available and to present 
work "representative of some type 
of personal vision on the part of the 
filmmaker." However, she admits 
that ahe will discriminate against a 
film "on the basis of it being highly 
manipulative or too slick," two 
qualities which often contaminate 
films that are widely released to-
day. 

This year's films deal with dra-
matic, comedic and romantic plots 
such as political controversy, com-
ing of age, amorous relationships, 
death and AIDS. While all of these 
films possess a common focus, the 
issues are simultaneously explored 
through varied cultural perspec-
tives. If these different approaches 
to filmmaking live up to the suc-
cess of past years, they will intro-
duce us to enlightening stories full 
of originality and intrigue. 

Blue, with Juliette Binoche 
(Damage and The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being), will be shown 
at 8 p.m. tonight in UCSD's 
Mandeville Auditorium. All other 
screenings through May 31 will be 
shown at the same time and in the 
same location but on varying days 
of the week. Festival passes cost 
$25 for students, while single tick-
ets are $4. For more information, 
call the UCSD Box Office at 534-

The War Room 
Documentary slwws 

intensity of Clinton campaign 
Staff Writer 

If you followed the 1992Presi-
dential campaign at aU, the docu-
mentaryfilmTMWarRoomwon't 
tell you much you don't already 
know about the Democrats' strat-
egy or offer any shocking revela-
tions. But if you ' re interested in 
seeing an intense account of what 
goes into running a modern presi-
dential campaign, yoi may be in 
for a treat. 

D.A. Pennebaker 's and Chris 
Hegedus ' film about the group that 
managed the Clinton presidential 
campaign documents behind-the-
scenes maneuvers from the party 
primaries all the way to the fren-
zied night of victory. Most of the 
movie's action takes place in 
Clinton's grungy campaign head-
quarters in Little Rock, Ark., 
dubbed the "War Room." 

Almost everything you would 
expect is faithfully shown - the 
campaign's "spin-doctors" trying 
to get their version of events to the 
press, the earnest squabbling over 
details as mundane as what color 
the signs at the Democratic Con-
vention should be and the fervent 
scrambling to counter the 
opposition's attacks.

.... "'-

But what makes this documen-
tary so absorbing are the person-
alities driving the campaign -
more specifically, that of the iras-
cible James Carville, Clinton's 
campaign manager. For amid all 
the shuffling of eager young staff-
ers and the surrounding chaos 
stands Carville, who is unambigu-
ously the star of the film. 

CaTV iIle expresses himself with 
his own distinctive brand of South-
ern charm. Take his comments on 
Ross Perot's candidacy and the 
millions he spent on it: "this has 
gotta be the most expensive act of 
masturbation in world history." 

It is a testament to the experi-
ence and ability of documentary 
filmmakers Pennebaker and 
Hegedus that their subjects seem 
oblivious to the camera, which 
captures so many remarkable mo-
ments of candor . . 

Just watching Carville in ac-
tion, in the performance of the 
year, is worth the price of admis-
sion. 

The War Room will open to-
morrow at the Ken Cinema in 
Kensington and will show through 
Jan. 20. Tickets are $6.50. For 
showtimes and directions, call 283-

10 SPORTS The UCSD Guardiaa 

UCSD Ready To Set Sail 
RElAnA: San Diego has poor showing at Rose Bowl Intersectional, but looks 
forward to 1994 campaign with a new coach and a much-improved team 
ByOurk Le 
Guardian Reporter 

This could be one of the best 
years in UCSD sailing history. With 
the addi tion of its first full-time head 
coach, J.c. Durbin, the team has the 
opportunity for a record-breaking 
season. 

"This year's team is the most 
organized," co-captain Josh Fellman 
said. "Things are looking bright for 
the future. " 

The results of its most recent 
regatta, however, were not exactly 
made for the reco'rd books. In the 
Rose Bowl Intersectional on Jan. 8-
9, 17 schools from California, in-
cI uding Berkeley and Stanford, com-
peted in seven different races. UCSD 
sent A-Division members Ed Cham-
bers (skipper) and Eric Wilcox 

(crew). San Diego's highest finish 
during the event was 10th. 

"It wasn't a very good regatta for 
us," Fellman admitted. 

A regatta consists of six to eight 
races in one day. Each boat has one 
skipper, who navigates, and one 
crewman, who handles the large sail 
and the weight distribution of the 
boat. 

The team competed against 15 
other West Coast schools in the Pa-
cific Coast League. 

"It's a really good way to get in a 
team atmosphere without too much 
competition," co-captain Marianne 
Howkins said. "The sport requires 
time and commitment, but not too 
much. You don't have to wake up at 
6 a.m." 

UCSD owns three 15-foot sail-
(crew), and B-Division members boats, called Flying Juniors, and 
Greg Korn (skipper) and Jason Petit shares two others with San Diego 

State University. Its weekly sched-
ule consists of one practice at Mis-
sion Bay Harbor and one practice in 
the classroom to go over strategy. 

"There is definitely skill required 
in this sport," Fellman said. "At the 
same time, you can ~ t power your 
way through races. It is a thinking-
man's sport." 

While the team continues to im-
prove, it is still handicapped by its 
lack of resources. As a club sport, 
the dedicated squad has struggled, 
keeping afloat with monies raised in 
annual partial funding from the rec-
reation department. 

And though UCSD's boats are 
more than lO years old, nobody is 
complaining. A good sailor will try 
to keep any boat afloat in the rough-
est of waters.

Patrick Roy, but his drunken, near-
sighted brother, Lou. 

The rest of our team wasn't hav-
ing much luck, either. At one point, 
our center, Brian, fell to the ground 
to block an oncoming shot. Unfor-
tunately, he chose to block it with 
his, well, a part of his anatomy that 
probably shouldn't be used to stop 
high-speed projectiles. 

Play was stopped as Brian 
writhed on the ground, begging for 
death. And the angels wept. 

Another player, Pete, was hav-
ing problems of his own. Stricken 
with the flu, Pete valiantly suited up 
for our early moming game. There 
was no way he was going to let the 
team down - at least not until he 
collapsed midway through the first 
period when the pain became too 
great. Pete was carried out to the 
bathroom, where he presumably 
breathed his last. 

The rest of us should have been 
so lucky ....

Thunday, Jaauary 13,1994 

I lost track of the ICOre after our 
opponents cracked the double-digit 
barrier. Discouraged. I uked one of 
my teammates to try his band at 
goalie. Even more discouraging, he 
did better than I, despite having never 
played the game before. 

Clearly, we were out of our 
league, in every' sense of the word. 
We were like the Ottawa Senators, 
only the Senators are mildly more 
skilled than we are. Mildly. 

But our opponents respected us, 
at least when they weren't cracking 
their ribs rolling on the floor, laugh-
i ng at our ineptitude. There we were, 
a ragtag bunch of near-incompe-
tents vainly hoping against hope that 
we actually belonged on the same 
floor as our clearly superior oppo-
nents. 

Heck, Brian even sacrificed his 
chances of siring an heir just to stop 
a simple puck in a game that was 
long since decided. It was enough to 
bring a tear to your eye - it cer-
tainly brought tears to Brian's. 

Inspired, I shouted out to my 
teammates. "Way to go, fell as. 
We've got them on the run now." 

That's when they started club-
bing me with their sticks:

People always wonder what 

inspired me to become a writer. 
Was it my need to create, my 
love of literature, my clever turn 
of phrase? No, it was nothing so 
grand, unfortunately. I became a 
writer because whenever I have 
to do anything athletic, I resemble 
a crippled gazelle coming off a 
three-week coke jag. 

CHEERIO OLD CHAP: UCSD extends its winning 
streak to six with 77-61 shelling of Chapman University 

There. My dirty little secret is 
out. I don't run, so much as I 
stagger drunkenly. I couldn't 
catch a softball on a bet. My golf 
scores are in t!l.e triple digits on a 
good day. I was once cut from a 
swim team that never cut any-
one, for God's sake. 

So I should have learned my 
lesson by now. When I was 
picked last on all the teams in 
elementary school, when I was 
named starting benchwarmer on 
my seventh grade basketball 
team, I should have taken the 
hint and gone back to doing things 
I'm good at, like watching tele-
vision or eating fruit-on-the-bot-
tom yogurt. 

But like a masochist yearning 
to be wal\oped over the head 
with a steel mallet, I keep com-
ing back. I keep signing up for 
intramural teams, and inevita-
bly, I keep having what remains 
of my pride handed back to me 
with each pitiful defeat. 

My floor hockey team this 
quarter is such a case in point. 
We signed up for a double-A 
league, which seemed like a swell 
idea at the time. After all, we 
were a plucky squad of up-and-
comers, ready to give any team 
tbe game of our lives. And be-
sides, all the single-A leagues 
were full up. 

So when we arrived at the 
Rec Gym for our first game last 
Saturday, we had little idea of 
the fate that our cruel gods had in 
store for us. Oh sure, our two 
best players were sitting out with 
injuries, but we remained un-
daunted. "Let's give 'em what 
for, boys," I bellowed in a pre-
game pep talk as my team cheered 
lustily. How foolish we were. 
How foolish .... 

The game was barely a few 
minutes old when tbe pucks 
started whizzing past my head 
and into the net. As a goalkeeper, 
I was doing a wonderful imper-
sonation of a sieve. My play in 
the net reminded the spectators 
of Roy. Unfortunately, not

firepower to demonstrate to the [se-
lection] committee exactly where 
we are coming from." 

Statesman Marshall can chalk up 
Tuesday's 77-60 upset pounding of 
Division II foe, Chapman Univer-
sity, to the plus column for the 
Triton's future political assault. 

UCSD (12-3), which played vic-
tim to the same Chapman unit, 81-
68, at the Redlands' Lee Fulmer 
Tournament, Dec. 2-4, exacted a 
strong measure of revenge by hu-
miliating the Panthers (8-5) on their 
own floor. 

Last weekend's La Jolla Classic 
MVP, senior Rodney Lusain, con-
tinued his poiDt guard clinical prac-
tice on the overwhelmed Chapman 
squad, carving up every Pantber 
defensive tbat was strategically 
tbrown at bim. Lusain tallied 20 
points, five assists and three steals. 

Chris R ....... been â€¢ keYal*k off the bench for the TrIt .... 

Before five minutes of the pme 

bad elapsed, Lusain bad drilled two 
deep three-point bombs, pilfered a 
key steal and set up botb sophomore 
forward Matt Minneban and fresb-
man center Matt Aune for two quick 
buckets. 

The Panthers never knew what 
hit them. Chapman called for an 
early tUne out, trailing 12-5, but it 
did tbem little good. UCSD's 
stauncb defense held and the offen-
sive arsenal rattled off two quick 
bukets, one of which was another 
deep Lusain three-pointer dialed in 
from a different area code. 

Before Chapman could blink, the 
Tritons commanded a 17-7 lead and 
the Panthers were forced to call their 
second time out in two minutes. 

The result: UCSD went on an-

other run, extending ita advantage 
to an insurmountable 18 points, and 
went into the locker room up at the 
half, 44-28. 

When the Tritons weren't con-
verting from the perimeter - a rare 
occurrence indeed . considering 
UCSD canned 61 percent of its field 
goals in the first half - Minneban 
and Aune were sweeping the boards 
almost without effort. 

Minnehan pulled down a game-
. high 14 rebounds, and Aane reeled 

in 10 to go aJoaa with 19 points.

sive flow of the .... We were 
ellecuting oar off..... at will," 
Marshall said. â€¢ ADd aD; rebouDd in 
the area beloopd to Anne and 

Minnehan." 
On tbe other side of the ball, the 

Triton defense again came up with 
all the big plays, swiping steals and 
deflecting passes that led to easy 
layups down court. 

Marshall threw a multitude of 
players including Nate Hangin, 
Lusain, Erik Jobnson and Cbris 
Ressa at the Panther's top outside 
shooter, Greg Reynolds, limiting 
Chapman's main offensive threat to 
a mere 11 points and three rebounds. 

Meanwhile, Johnson was light-
ing up the skiea with tbree-point 
buckets of his own, nailing three on 
his way to recording 13 points. 

Sophomore 'forward Khalil 
Allen, in foul trouble for much of 
the game, finished with eight points. 

"We prepared really hard for 
[Cbapman], and it showed on the 
court, .. Marshall said. "This is a big 
win, especially on their floor. Our 

losstothemcam~onaneutral floor." 
Big wins are nothing new for the 

Tritons tbis year. UCSD has de-
feated top-notcb Division IJI teams, 
Calvin and Millikin universities, and 
Division II Olapman. But probably 
the most convincing victory for the 
Tritons wu an unprecedented wal-
loping of Division â€¢ Northern Ari-
zona University. 

"At the end of IS games to be 12-
3 with a schedule as difficult as ours 
is a real tribute to how hard this team 
worked," Marshall said. 

"All our seniors want to .go out 
on a positive note. They all bring 
something special to this team. They 
have been through the wars and 
know what it takes to get [to the 
tournament)." 

". think [the committee] will have 
to take a JOOd long look at us," 
Marshall concluded. "We have 
plenty of firepower to point to."
