KS-I03 disc jockey, 
Miller, dismissed 
Bv JAMES P. PINPIN. StaffWnter 

Randy Miller, a KS-I03 disc 
jockey, has been released due to 
dechnlng ratings and ontinued 
clashes with San Diego area 
minority groups, according to 
Chris Conway, station president 
and general manager 

"ThiS latest episode was the last 
of a series of problems we had with 
Randy." Conway 'aid . Conway 
explained that Miller's contract 
wa for two years with the option of 
renewal after one year. Miller 
received a contract offer from an 
Atlanta _ration . but KS-103 opted 
against a counter offer . 

Conway pOInted out that though 
Miller due to hiS contract. could 
have ' tayed until the end of this 
month , management told him that 
hiS last day was Apnl 10. Miller IS 
now working at tanon WZGZ 93 
In Atlanta . 

"Further investigation with 
prominent black leaders, Hispanic 
leaders [and ]JeWish leaders found 
that it has been a consistent 
pattern of the station to take the 
Americans of color and to demean 
and dehumanize them ," Fongsald. 

Fong said that when people 
called the tation to ask for an 
apology and to ask them to stop the 
off-color remark's, the callers were 
ridi culed . "The management 
would ap o logi ze and say 
[something) like 'I'm sorry because 
you overrea ted ,'" she said . 

Fong explained that current 
eve nts relating to trade policies 
could lead to unfavorable attltudes 
toward Asian-Americans. 

he stated that the oalitlon 
onfronted sponsors of the radiO 

station, including California First 
Bank and Japanese car produ er . 
"Why should any of our Asian 
people sponsor or pay for Randy 
Miller' salary?" Fong asked . 

Ii . Bry~n GUU"!W/I 

A cording to Virginia Fong, 
coordinator of the Aslan/ Pacifi 
Islander Media Respon!-ol btllty 
Coalition which wa formed in 
reaction to the Miller inCIdent, 
Miller's release is not enough to 
compensate for the damage done. 

Fong went on to say that the 
coalmon would probably picket 
the station until they get a real Randy Miller will no longer be spinning records for KS-1 03, as station president and general manager Chris Conway decided against renewing Miller's contract. See MILLER, page 9 

A.S. Judi£al Boa 
drops n. i. charges 

Anlmal group charged with arson 
By ERIC CHAZANKlN, Staff Writer 

The Associated Students Judical Earhart, AS. Judicial Board chair: 
Board has refused to hear the outlined the Board's reasoning 
remaining charges being brought regarding charges 3F, 3H and 3G. 
by the new indicator Collective Charge 3F, against the entire 
against the AS. Council and AS. AS. Council, stemmed from the 
Pre ident John Riley. Council's action limiting the new 

" ... the source of the 
problem was the [A.S.] 
Media Board and not the 
CounciL" 

This was only the latest 
development in a longstanding 
conflict between the AS. Coun iI 
and the new indicator over fund ing. 
At one point earlier this year, the 
Council had frozen the account of 
the new indicator in re pon e from 
the overspending and budget 
problems that the paper suffered 
last year. 

.More recently , lower-than-
expected funding levels, prompted 
charges against the A . Media 
Board, which was found gUilty. 
Charge were al 0 filed against 
Riley anu the ouncil , which the 
Judicial Board ha now effectively 
di ml sed In an April 16, 1987 
letter to the Ilew Indicator, Brad 

Indicator's budget as recommended 
by the AS. Media Board . Earhart'S 
letter began by stating that charge 
3 F was, "impossible to hear within 
the realm of our system ," because it 
was brought against an entire 
legislative body. 

The letter then explai ned why 
the charges were unfounded 
regardless of the Judicial Board's 
ability to hear them, laying the 
blame at the feet of the already-
convicted Media Board : "We 
believe the Council accepted the 
Media Board's conclu ions as 
legitimate . .. Thus, the source of 
the problem was the [AS.] Media 
Board and not the Council." 
Funding requests fo r alte rnative 
media suc h as the new indicator 
routinely go first to the Media 
Board, which makes recommenda-
tions to the A . . CouncIl. 

Charge 3H, again t A .. 
President John Riley, involved his 
failure to veto the funding-limiting

moderate Reagan.

State fire marshal's investiga-

tors charged the militant Animal 
Liberation Front (ALF) with 
staning a fire that caused $2.5 
million wonh of damage to a UC 
Davis veterinary medicine 
diagnostic laboratory April 16. 

An $11,500 reward was offered 
for Information leading to the 
arrests of the arsoni t . Officials 
said they doubted the 
perpetrators intended to cause a 
fi re a large a they did. 

The Federal Bureau of 
Inve tigation , along with state 
and local official , is involved in 
the investigation due to a 
"suspicion of arson, bombing, or 
te rrorist action." Fife official 
said it was clearly the bigge t fire 
to 0 cur on campus in the past 10 
years. 

ALF, an international group 
with roots in Europe, claimed 
responsibility for vandalism to 

legislation. This charge "is imilarly 
u nappro-achable," onti nued 
Earhart's letter, stating that Rtley's 
decision nO( to ve to the legi lation 
limiting the new indicator's 
funding, - . .. fa Us withm a political 
realm." Again , citing that the 
already-punished N\edia Bo<lfd 

- Robert Israel 
A man behind the 
stage , 

the campus that occurred hours 
before the fire . ALF claimed that 
by painting slogans and slashing 
tires on t8 automobiles parked 
on campus It was retahanng "in 
the name of the thousands of 
animals tortured each year in 
campu labs." 

In a later press release , ALF 
claimed responsibility for the 
blaze that gutted the half-
constructed building that was to 
be the most modem and up-to-
date veterinary diagnostl 
laboratory in the country. 

Completion of the structure 
was scheduled for August, but the 
fire has caused a SIX to seven 
month delay. 

.Rea non from other antmal 
nghts groups to the arson was 
mixed . The Animal Rights Direct 
Action Coalition praised ALFs 
action , wh ile the more widely 
known People for the Ethical 

was the body responsible for the 
difficulty, the section regarding 
charge 3H concluded, 'We fee l Mr. 
Riley did nothing wrong." 

An additional charge , 3G , 
related to 3F and 3H, was also 
dismissed. 

Along with dismi sing charges,

Treatment of Animals denounced 
them. 

Fire offtclals .lId the damages 
could have been limited to 
. 1.000, If the sprinkler and 
hydrant system had been 
operational. 

According to UCD Police Chic! 
Bill Essex, ALF has been 
responsible for 10 to 15 other 
incidents on' campus, uch as 
vandaliZing researchers' homes 
and reporting fake bomb threats. 

Menl Stratton, director of the 
UCD Public Affairs Office and 
spoke person for the investiga-
tion , said that animal protests 
have occurred at UCD around 
April 24 since 1982. 

tratton also said that UC 
River Ide ha experienced 
protests and there is a possibility 
that UCLA may also be targeted 
thl year. ~ 

the A . JudiCial Board canceUed 
further hearings which were 
scheduled for Apri l 16, 23, and 30. 
"We Will , however, listen to clo ing 
argument con erning [remaining 
charge against) Mr. Eggers (AS. 
Commi sloner of Communica-
tion )," oncluded Earhart's letter.

San Diego ranked fifth worst 
smog area in the nation 

According to a three-year review by 
the Federal Environmental Protection 
Agency, San Diego County suffers the 
fifth worst smog problem in the nation . 

Based on the number of hours when 
each arca exceeds the federal ozone 
standard and on th~ peak conccntration 
of thc pollutant during smog attacks, the 
1983 to 1985 review indicates that Los 
Angeles has the worst smog problem in 
the nallort. The Houston-GalvestOn area, 
the greater Connecticut area, and the 
New York-New Jersey area are ranked 
second through fourth respectively. 

County air pollution officer Richard 
Sommerville blames Los Angeles for 

by Berke Breathed 

most of an Diego's smog progicills. 
Sommerville beheves the EPA's report is 
out of uate and overstated . 

According to ommelville , pollution 
from Lo Angeles ei ther caused or 
contributed to 61 percent of San Dlcgo 
County's smoggy days in 1983 and 74 
percent of smoggy days in 1986. If Los 
Angeles' sm g was subtracted f rOIll San 
Diego's, San Diego 1V0uid only be 
ranked 17 in the nation , he said. 
Sommervillc also said that San Diego's 
pollution problems dccreased 
significantly in 1986. 

The EPA released the report in the 
bcginning of April to ind icate which 
areas would need to take the most 
drastic actions to avoid sevcre smog 
control measure by December 31 as 
mandated by thc Clean Air Act. 

Thc county is currcntly petitioning 
thc EPA to rcvicw San Diego's ranking 
to avoid penalties. 

EPA officials recognize some of the 
report's shortcomings and are 
invcstigating possible solutions; 
however, they emphasized that this is a 
preliminary report. The final rcport is 
seheduled to be relcased in August. 

Sena te bill seeks 
"literacy corps" 

Scnate Labor and Human Resourccs 
Committee Chairman Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced a bill to 
establish a "literary corps" of college 
students who would earn academic 
credir for tutoring chIldren and illiterate 
adults. 

The students would spend six hours a 
wcek tutoring in reading and math in 
public schools, jails and other 
institutions. 

Retircd Chief Justicc Warren I!. 
Burgcr said that the program could have 
as much impact as the Peace Corps. 
Berger stressed the importance of a 
lireratc pubhc to a dcmocratic society at 
a hearing of Kennedy's committce.

65 mph limit to be 
enforced by radar 
By j.W. AKERS-SASSAMAN. CUI'ICt>/ Corrr pClIl,kllt 
ACRAMENTO, lie Will' 

Califomians would be able to drivc 
65 miles-pcr-hour on 1.191 mile 
of thc statc 's highways and thc 
Callfomia Highway Patrol would 
bc allowcd to use radar to cnsurc 
they don't go any faster. according 
to rwo bills approved yesterday. 

Thc Sena te Transporttltion 
Commlllce voted 12-0 to approvc 
Assembly Bill 669 by Assembly-
mcmber Richard Katz (D-Los 
Angeles), which would raise [he 
speed limit on rural frecways to 65 
MPH. 

Thc 55 MPH speed limit would 

remain In efrect on urban 
highways, th e bill statcs. and large 
trucks, sc hool buses, farm labor 
vehiclcs and vehicles IOwll1g 
trailers would remain limited to a 
55 MPH. 

The mcasure makes California 
law conform to recently enacted 
fcderal legislation that allows 
incrcased speed limits on rural 
interstatc highways. The mC,lsure 
makes thc CHP and the California 
Department of Transponallon 
responsiblc for decichng which 
roads should have the higher 
specd limit. 

"Allowing , laiC lO decltk whlLh 
rural Interstates Me OCSI sUlled for 
Ilighcr speeds makes sense ,' Katz 
said . "Who IS more l<lpable of 
m.lklng thai tletCrmmdllon In thiS 
state - a bure,lUcmt Sitting bchintl 
a desk In WashmglOn or the 
California Highway Patrol?" 
Because the bill is an urgency 
measure, it will go IntO effect 
Immediately after illS approved by 
the legislature and Signed mto law 
by Gov. George DeukmeJlan . 
DeukmeJian has said that he will 
approve the measure when It 
reaches his desk. which many 
observers predict will h<lppen In 
mid-June. 

Highways Initially slated [Q have 
a 65 MPH limn Include: Interstate 5 
from the Oregon border LO south of 
Bakersfield, except In the 
metropolitan areas around 
Reddi ng , Sacramento anti 
Stockton; I-50S , from 1-5 to 1-80; 1-
205 in San Joaquin County; and 1-
LO cast of San Bernardmo [Q the 
Arizona border. 1-15 , north of San 
Bernardino to the eVJda border 
and 1-40 from BarslOw to the 
ArIZona border would .llso have 65 
MPH limits. 

Other highway segments could 
be included after the required 
engmeering and trafric surveys are 
completed by the CHP and the 
DepMtment of Transportation. It 
has been estimated that up [Q 
1.300 miles of freeway could 
quality tor the higher limit.

Could Reagan be right? 
Ever since the Iran thing, the Reagan Admll1istration ha been 

trying to alter Its present image of being ultra· onservative , what 
wah Ed Meese II1dlCtIng white supremacist groups (IS the 
Rchnquist COUlt next?) and an occastonal SOCial program. 0 It was 
surpnsing but not earthshakll1g to fInd that a semi-democratic 
notion had found its way Into Ronme's script. With the reluctant 
imposition of tariffs on some japanese products he has saved a few 
Amencan jobs and possibly an entire industry. Let's hope thiS isn't 
an effon to solicit contra money from Motorola . 

Re ently, we experienced a sharp decline In Oil and gasol Ine 
prices when the "disorganized" OPEC nations began 
overprodUCIng and consequently cutting each other's throats. The 
pnce of a barrel of Oil (rom the Middle East plunged some 60 
percent, forcIng the Umted States and European nations, whose 
costs of production exceeded the scllIng pnce, out of the busine s. 
Whether this was Intenllonal or nOl, (It IS begll1nlllg to appearthat 
way), It ultimately worked to OPEC's advantage by clOSing down 
mu h of the competillon and returnIng the bulk of the market to the 
presently cooperatlvc OPEC nations. As was the case 111 the early 
and late '70s , OPEC will undoubtedly hike the prices as soon as the 
threat of competlllon IS gone . 

It is eVident that the japanese electronics compames intend to 
employ a similar taCti in elIminating the American competition 
from the Silicon computer chi p market. They have been selhng 
these components at a neganve profit tn foreign markets, breaktng 
the trade agreement signed with the United Srates last nme such 
business cthlcs were discovered. 

When dealing on the level, the japanese manufacturers still have 
an advantage over Amencan manufacturers. The chips are less 
costly to begin with, stncejapanese labor costs are lower,and , since 
many Japanese chips are copes or updates or their American 
counterparts, the research and development costs are much lower. 
However, the "dumpIng" of such produ ts omo the market ,lI1d the 
erecnon of virtually Impcnetrable trade bamers by the japanese 10 
protcct their home market Justify Similar aCllons on our part. 

It must be stressed that tanffs alone arc not a cure-all for the u.s. 
trade defIcit and overprotecting domesllc Industries may undo 
some of the positive actions Amencan ompal1les have undertaken 
10 combat the senou threat posed by foreign compe(l(ors 

lrom ally, japanese compellllon has had a produ live effect on 
Amencan busll1ess where the consumer IS con emed. QualIty 
levels of products such as dutomobilcs and stereo equipment have 
lI1ueased sigl1lficantly SInce the mid 1970 whenJapan became J 
senous ·ompetiror. Prices, however, hJve remall1ed low, and thiS 
has forced Amencan tndustry to streamline ItS management and 
producllon lInes while rewnll1g quality 111 order to remain 
compellllve. The Imroductlon of proteCllve polICies could have .I 
negative effect on the qualIty 0 Amencan product If the 
companies take advantage of the decrease 111 competition . There 
,llso eXists the dangcr of unlawfullmpo!>itlon of ranffs by corrupt 
politiCians for finanCial compensation by a domestic corporation . 
Therefore, tanff bills should be conSidered in an open fJshion ,1I1d 
only Imposed 111 ~IIUallOnS where the 'lffected country is dOll1g the 
same. In shon , they shoulu be used to baloll1ce a trade slluatlOn, not 
slant It. 

So far, the Reagan Admll1lstratlon , in a typically conservative but 
nOl neccssanl), eVil manner, h..ls been hesitant 10 support tariff bills 
except In SIlUJtlOns that OagrJntly call for them ThiS, for now, rna)' 
be .I valid Jppro.Kh In an Jttempt 10 persuade othercountnes to be 
more open with their economics. If this falls , a bit morc

defined (under Webster) as "a

Never have I seen their an to bc 
degrading 10 individuals or 
unpleasant to the eye. Yes, they can 
be called Fascists, but only in the 
sense that they have exalted the 
nonon of an on a campus that 
conSiders talking trees as 
creath'll)'. Professor Metzger also· 
found the wall-wrIters 10 be 
'immoral' because they use the 
otherwise blank, gray con rete 
walls as canvas, Principles have 
changed, students can no longer (if 
indeed they ever could) tolerate 
living in an atmosphere of ugly 
concrete buildings that remind us 
of pnson walls or Lebanon, as 
Warren Housing is fondly called. It 
is through the wall-writers that this 
sc hool is obtaining character and 
color. Instead of bei ng treated as 
criminals they s h ou ld be 
complimented on making our 
stat rwells a more pleasa nt 
thoroughfare . 

Summing It up 
Editor: 

As a former AS. presidential 
candidate, I wish to take this 
opportunity to thank those who 
took the time to understand my 
omewhat complex campaign 

messages. Despite an ungraceful 
end to three years of working for 
and representing UC D students, I 
can honestly say that I have 
enjoyed the work and that at all 
times, I was altruistically seeking 
the best Interest of students and 
doing my best to achieve that end. 

And now I ask students to focus 
their attention on deciding who 
will be the next AS. President. The 
run-off IS Monday, April 27 
between Dave Friend and Dave 
Marchick. 

I have the unique advantage of 
having seen both candidates "in 
action" both on the campaign trail 
and on the AS. Council, and, 
therefore, 111 think I am being 
objective in stating my whole-
hearted support for Dave Friend 
for A.S. president. 

I agree with the accusations put 
forth by other AS. Councilmem-
bers In the Guardian (4 · ])·87) that 
Marchick cannot boast of original 
and new idcas. His platform is 
based cntirely on the work of 
others. He might as well have 
promised students a University 
Center if elected! 

Mar hick's unethical methods 
do not StOP there, however. He has 
rcsorred to slander of other 
candidates. He can even be 
justifiably accused of using his 
current po!>ltIon in the AS. as a 
means to Ingratiate hi mself wah 
members of student services, and, 
thus, his Job has been treated 
merely as a vehicle to thc AS, 
presidency. 

Dave Fnend sharply contrasts 
Iwith l Marchick in many ways. 
Dave Friend did not choose to 
work on the juiciest ISSUseS 
because he has not used his 
pOSition purely to seek notoriety. 
Yet, Dave Friend has proven his 
success as a qualified student 
leader on many Imporrant Issues. 
Furthermore, Dave Friend will not, 
unlike Marchlck, rake offe nse to 
constructive cntlclsm. Dave 
Friend is open·minded and wIll be 
responsive to students as he has 
proven dUring his tcrm as enator. 
Finally, Dave Fnend's unueninblc

ability to work With others will be a 
tremendous assest to a better 
working AS which can mobilize 
coalitions of students. 

Above all. Dave Friend 
possesses Integrity, a trait which is 
a prereqUisite for effective 
reprcsentation . Dave Friend has 
conductcd quite a different 
campaign than that of Marchick. 
His campaign, be ause it has bcen 
honest and cthlcal, hJS nO! been <IS 
effe tive as Davc Marchick's. It is 
interesting 10 note that only the 
most informed and involvcd 
students, those closest 10 the A.S , 
recognize this point. Students .Ire 
being duped! I sincerely hope thar 
students will see th rough Dave 
Marchlck's superficiality and elect . 
an AS. Prcsident they can truSt and 
respect. .. Dave Friend.

If you are currently declared as one of the six 
biology majors (or if you will declare one of these 
as your major prior to the end of Spring quarter, 
1987), you MUST go to the Biology Student 
Services Office to obtain an important 
information handout regarding biology degree 
requirements, which will be available in the 
magazine rack outside of room 1208, Muir 
Biology Building. Please note that any student 
who declares, or changes, his/her major after 
Spring Quarter, 1987, will be held responsible for 
the requirements listed in the 1987-88 UCSD 
catalog. The information handout should be 
picked up as soon as possible and definitely 
before the end of Spring Quarter.

Hart, the committee's chairperson. 
After Hart questioned whether the 
bill would prevent "malingerers" from 
taking adva ntage of the

bill was not needed because 
eXlsllng fmancial aid would

Although It was later noted that 
UCs answer was wrong and that 
state and federal financial a id

In the end, the commlUee voted

use that research , that's fine ; if they 
don 't want to use It, that's up to

"It IS not up to anyone outside 
the news mcdla to pressure the 
news media to follow enain 
gUldclmes for the carrymg of 
SUICide stories or to generate 
gUidelines for the carryi ng of 
SUicide stories," Phillips said. "It is 
lalsoJ not up to any people outside 
the news media to suggest that a 
task foree be set up to consider 

how 10 handle thiS situallon; It is 
entirely up to the news media ," 

The media's portrayal of suicide, 
especially in the coverage by the 
major news networks, and the 
impact of these newscasts on teens 
as well as adults, has been a topiC of 
comprehensive study by Phillips 
and Lundie Carstensen, which was 
pubhsehd in the New England 
Journal oj Medicine (Se pt. IL, 1986), 
In reference to this study, Phillips 
said, "The impact of suicide stories 
seems to be very much larger for 
teenagers than it IS for adults, the 

increase In teen SUI Cides IS 15 
times as large percentage-wise as is 
the increase in adults; this is the 
increase laeross the countlyl after 
all stones can-ied in the network 
evening news." 

Statistics compiled by the 
American Asso iatlon of 
SuiCidology e umatcs that there 
arc about 35,000 SUICides ,I year in 
the U.S., of which 10,000 are 
persons between the agesofnfteen 
and th irty-four The' true figures, 
however, of total number of 
suicides is believed 10 be closer to 
100,000 per year, smce many are 
reported as accidents or in such a 
way as to cover up the actual cause 
of death, due to the stigma 
attached to sUlclues., 

College age students an: most at 
nsk as they are usually in transltlon 
between dependent child 'adole-
sent and an independent adult , 
stated Dr. john Giebink, Director 
of UCSD's Psychological Services. 
Giebink had preVIOusly noted in a 
past mterview With the Guardian, 
"SuiCide IS also the second leading 
cause of death in co llege age men, 
second only 10 death caused by 
trauma sustailled m aCCidents , of 
whieh a fraction are SUICides in 
disgUise." However, the proportion 
of arremped suicides to succes ful 
ones among collegr age 
mdividuals is approximately 50 to 
1. 

A cordmg to Phillips, "judging 
from the number of suicides on 
campus that I'm aware of, the 
suicide rate on Ithe UCSDJ 
campus is not abnormally high . 
Considering the size of the 
population and the age 
distribution, we are not 
expenencing a suicide rate which 
is markedly different than one 
would expect for the same size 
population , which is reassuring.

Innovatively setting stages 
By D. HERZ, Staff Wmer 

Robert Israel, head of the theater 
deSign program in UCSD's Drama 
Department says he is tired and he 
has good reason to be so. In the past 
two years he has worked on and 
comple ted at /cast six separate 
theatrical deSign projects as well as 
teachmg full time here at UCSD. 

As head of the design program, 
Israel mstructs a number of 
talented grilduate students. "I think 
wc have some very good 
deSigners ," Israel said. At present, 
Isracl IS Involved pnmarily with 
teach lllg tWO undergraduate 
courses, as well as a graduate 
course. He also acts as a graduate 
adVisor, 

Israel's work has not gone 
unnoticed . Slllce last year, he has 
received five awards and twO 
grants from the Na ti ona l 
Endowment for the Arts III stage 
and costume deSign . List OClOber, 
he received the prestlglousjoseph 
M;lh.lI-am Foundation Award for 
hiS work on the off- Broddway 
prod uction of "Vienna: Lusthaus" 
which was ulrecred by MJrthu 
Clarke . The play WilS once

consisted of a cavemous room 
with huge walls tilti ng inward. 

"The piece is surrealistiC," Israel 
said , "like a fantasy or dream . But I 
don't think my overall work is 
surrealistic. It is very much a part of 
who I am. I don't think I have a 
style . It just looks like me, what I do. 
It's my work," Israel said, 

The play first appeared In New 
York at St, C1cment's Church , a 
building not originally intended to 
be used as a theater. "Eve ry space 
offers limitations," Israel said. "I 
JUSt work with the space. It was a 
wonderful space to deSign in . 

"Every designer sees each 
situation as an opportunity to 
describe the play and allow the 
actors to perform the play better 
wlth the environment they are in, 
Evclything IS modified b)' and 
conditioned by the play and those 
you collaboratc with ." 

Right now brael IS agal n 
planning to work with Maltha

the Intemational Theatel festival

opinron, He leels that he has room 
to maneuver with his designs. "I 
have lots of independence," he 
said . "But ItS more a matterofbeing 
synchro nistic . Sometimes I 
propose something and she . 
changes it and I like the changes. 
Or maybe It works the other way 
around , It's a very sympathetic 
working relationship." 

Israel graduated rn 1963 With an ' 
M.FA in painting from the 
University of Michigan. However, 
hi future in that fie ld was not 
bright. "I wasn't very good," he 
admitted . 

He 1,l(er became involved with

Glebink stated, "In each case we 
'met with persons who were closely 
involved with the persons who h,ld 
commlUed SUICide. For example , 
for the male who commmed 
SUICide, we met With hiS fraternity, 
which turned out to be beneficial 
because it gave them a chance to

him , also some of their own

Well , my term in office as AS. President IS comi ng to a close and it sure has 
had it's share of ups and downs. Most of th e items in the infamous "Four Point 
Plan" have been carried out in various degrees. Some have been quite easy to 
implement immediately. On the other hand. others are simply impossible to 
accomplish within a term of only one year. however a basis for th ese projects 
has been set up for the next AS. President. I feel as though my term has been 
successful overaU and I hope you feel the same. 

My final Sta te of the Campus Address was scheduled fo r April 29 (my last day 
in office). but because of this problem with the elec tions my terms has been 
extended for a week so I will postpone the fi nal State of the Campus Address to 
May 6. I will give a kind of year in review for the Associated Students 
Government. It should be a fun one as The Incidentals will be my featured

"BOW I 818,000 
FOR COLLEGE 
BY WOIIIDIIIi "IIIENDS." 

When my friends and I graduated 
from high school, we all took part-time jobs to pay for college. 

They ended up in car washes and 
hamburger joints, putting in long hours 

, for little pay. ' 
Not me. My job takes just one 

weekend a month and two weeks a year. 
Yet, I'm eamin~ $18,000 for college. 

Because IJoined my local Anny 
National Guar . 

They're' the people who help our 
state dunng emergencies like hurri-
canes and floods. They're also an 
important part of our country's military 
defense. ' 

So, since I'm helping them do such 
an important job, they~re helping me 
make it through school. 

As soon as I finished Advanced 
Training, the Guard gave me a cash 
bonus of $2,000. Then, under the New 
GI Bill, I'm getting another $5,000 for 
tuition and books. 

Not to mention my monthly Army 
Guard paychecks. They'll add up to 
more than $11,000 over the six years 
r.m in the Guard. 

And if I take out a college loan, the 
Guard will help me pay it back - up to 
$1,500 a year, plus interest. . 

It all adds ul? to $l?,OOO-or ~8re 
-for college for Just a lIttle of my tIme.

WODlen's softball teaDl sweeps 
doubleheader front Whittier 
By KURT BElL 

Last Saturday softball oach 
Colleen Wight celebrated her 30th 
bIrthda y. As a present, her team 
gave her JUSt what she asked for, a 
double-header sweep over rIval 
WhtUler. But he meetIng, the 
Tmons' last games at home, 
seemed much less lIke a gnppmg 
batlle that "rivalry" usually implies, 
and more like a JOVial prelude to 
the post-game baroeque. The 

Tritons cake-walked past Whl[tler 
7-4 and 11-3, and the dugout 
mood Itself could not have been 
more festIve had II been lIned wllh 
balloons and streamers, 

Seni o r ca tc her Charissa 
HJmmetl reflected that 
enthUSiasm. "They're our rivals, it 
is mce that we have the ability to 
blow them away like that,"she said , 

"It's eXCiting to show what we're aU 
about." 

Hammett went four for four 111 
the first game, with twO doub les, 
two RBIs and a run scored. 

In that game the Tritons took an 
early lead with one run in the 
bottom of the first , but Whittier 
came back and tied it in the 
second . UCSD, however, answered 
With a three run, twO out , rally in 
the bottom of the second. But 
Whittier, hangll1g lOugh, came 
back again and tied it in the fifth , 

The TrItons. though . answered J 
second tIInc WI th th ree Illore that 
Jme Inmng. Debra Callabres 

sparked the aS5.1Ult with a lead off 
triple. A single, twO bunts, a stolen 
bJse and a sacnfice ny were 
responSible for the sCO ring. 

,Illabres also had twO other hit In 
thJt g<lme. The three runs were 
coffin n<lll for WhittIer, who dug 
their own grave by leaving 13 
wOlllen on base .

innings, and gave up one 
unearned run. 

Unlike Friday's affair, Ihis game 
was never in doubt. Bob Natal , the 
Tritons' answer to Coty Snydcr, 
and Brian Rude each hit fiTS[ 
inning home runs to give UCSD a 
3-0 lead. By the end of the fourth , 
the Tritons had amassed nine 
runs, and in the seventh Natal hit 
another ,me out. He has fourteen 
home runs on the season. 

Game twO ended 8-0 as 
freshman Mike Morgan (3-2) 
pitched a complete game sh urout, 
and Natal went 3 for 5. While 
the pitching and hitting of the 
Tritons has excelled , the defense 
hasn't done too badly, either. All 
three of the Menlo games ended in 
double plays forUCSD , the last one 
coming after a great. diving stOP by 
fresh man short sto p Johnn y 
Meyers. "That's a tremendous way 
to end the game," Triton coach Lyle 
Yates said . 

More importantly, it is a sign of 
UCSD's strength in all aspects of 
the game. 'This has the best 
balance of any team we've every 
had," Yates said. 

Curremly, the Trirons are the 
ninth ranked division III team in 
the coumry, and second in the 
West. But the new rankings will 
LO me out today, and Yates sees the 
Tritons moving up a notch or two. 

·Vet. even though UCSD has 
been scoring a ton of runs, and the 
starting pitchers have a combined 
21 -7 record . the crowds aren't 
llacki ng to the games at Olsen 
field . Perhaps it is because of its 
put of the way location , but Vates 
believes it is weU worth searchi ng 
[or. considenng the quality of 
baseball that is being played there. 
"We'vc ne ver really had a 
tremendous crowd ," he said . 
"They're missing a good bet nO( 
watching these players." 

On Saturday UCSD plays a 
doublehead against LaVeme. the 
one team from the West ranked 
higher than UCSD, and Yates 
would love to see some rowdy fans. 
''\'m hopmg for J big crowd to 
support us ," he ald. ' We could 
reaUy use it LaVerne's crowd was
