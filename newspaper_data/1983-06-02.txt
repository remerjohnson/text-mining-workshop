Financial Aid 1983-84 
Lower Inflation Prevents Shortfall

Federal budget cuI'; \\ III not

the ·8:~··84 school vcar. 
according to Tom Rutter . 
director of financial aid at 
lTCSl) In fact. monies alloted 
by Congress ha\'e remained 
"level" and e\en show a 
"slight increase" overall. 

Ruller explained that in 
spite of massive financial aid 
cuts threatened by the Reagan 
admin istration. "By the tlllle 
Congress approprla tes I he 
money for the program. we 
ha \"{' been succl'ssfll I e\er\,

created a finanCIal gap of one

in the 'H~,'H:~ financial aid 
budget at { CSD. It had bcen 
predicted that thl!'> gap \\ollle! 
Increase to fifteen hundred 

dollars for 'I'n 'S·t, but due to a 
levelling of IIlfiatlOn. it will 
remalll at Ihe one thousand 
dollar mark. 

Confidence among flllannal 
aid administrators recentlv 
Increased because of the 
turnaround in the aid 
SituatIOn. When the Repub, 
licans proposed original 
financial aid cut~, Rutter and 
others panicked. "I thought 
their political clout was going 
to be so st rong ... \\ here they 
could \ Irtually manipulate 
Congress in order to get what 
the\ wanted ." As a re~ult of 
\\ lciespred concern III thiS 
area, Congress \\'a~ flooded

Rutter feels that the "major

Letter to Students From 
the California Legislature 
An Open Letter to all 
University and College 
Students in California: 

Your future, and the future 
of your education, depend 
upon your willingness to speak 
out and act, for yourself, right 
now. 

I congratulate you on your 
initial success in the 
Legi lature in keeping open 
and accessible the public 
universities and colleges of 
California. The Education 
Subcommittees of both the 
Senate Finance and the 
A sembly Ways and Means 
Committees have rejected the 
Governor 's proposed fee 
increases for student at the 
University of California and 
California Slate University 
and his proposed first-time-
ever fee for community college 
students. Already 76,000 
st udents have been closed au t 
of our community colleges, 
and the Governor's proposed 
fee Increases would turn away 
another 8:~,OOO students from 
our commu ntty colleges. 

The struggle 
regarding student 
fees is far from 
over, 

Yet the struggle regarding 
~tudent fees is far from ov r. 
California has gone bankrupt. 
We face a huge state budget 
defiCit next vear. To balance 
"ur budget, we must either 
further cut (no\" into the 
mu~cl(' a nd bone of) Califor· 

nJa'~ public higher edUlallfln

your pre ence felt, your need 
and desire known, by every 
member of the Legislature. 
Right away, will you 
personally write, call (better) 
and vis it (t he best) your own 
loca l Senator and Assembly· 
person? Ask himlher point 
blank whether s/he shares 
your commitment to open 
accessible coileges and 
universities, withou t in-
creased fees, and whether slhe 
will support a tax increase to 
make that commitment real. 
Enlist your families, friends , 
relatives and neighbor. to do 
likewise. 

-In mid-June, Governor 
Deukmejian has the option oi 
vetoing legislative funding 
Increases for the UC, CSU and 
community college budgets, 
thereby forcing fee increases.

Letters to the Editor 

Are Mass Generalities the Norm? 
B y JEFF EASTER 

Recently I had a rather 
drunken discussion with a 
friend of mine on the word 
"Love." I had never given 
much thought to the diver e 
range of this word and had 
generally employed it in any 
"ituation requiring the 
s lightest hint to any kind of 
affection toward anything.

For example, " I love Rice 
Crispies, [ love Gilliagans 
Island , r love Rover, r love 
Mom, I lo ve Mildred 
Dumbrowski, [ love the 
Circle Jerks." Acceptable 
English all; but only if one 
can understand the conI ext 
in which the word is utilized . 
This loose abuse had never 
bothered me before. Love was 
just another functional tool 
for communication, another 
symbol which could cover for 
a Wide variet v of emot ions. 
But then my'friend pointed 
out to me the futilIt\- of 
trying to express - his 
emotions simply ilnd con -
cisely to his girlf nend. He 
told me thaI everv time he 
said t he words, "I -Io\e vou," 
he burned inside for -some 
better way to trul~ express 
the feelings he felt. And I 
realized that the language 
just doesn't contain solid 
concrele words to describe 
int ricate and complicated 
emotions, and is thus forced 
to sweep them all Into 

hackneyed catch ails like, "I 
Love you/ it/them." 

The poets have always 
strived to express emotion in 
descriptive complex images. 
and the best have succeeded 
in catching some angles of 
the indescribable. But despite 
their successes, their 
methods have some draw-
backs, The major short-
coming IS the fact that the 
images are to complex and 
thought out to ade<luately 
communicate a fleeting spur· 
of-the-molllcnt emot ion as it 
surfaces. Thu", the 1m man, 
when he wants to commun· 
icate in the normal input · 
output fa:-hion is restricted 
to brief, general and rather 
mcanll1gless.

Ihough, if given them, and 
can spew the out upon 
request. As for formulating 
adjectives and descript ion!-> of 
its own, a computer I:" 
completrly helpless. Ha\'ing 
survived an elementary 
Fortran class. [ was left with 
the impression that in order 
to minimize waste, the 
program sect ions must be 
conise as possible while still 
maintaining the ability to 
work. In other words, the 
adjectives in the computer 
language should be kept to a 
bare minimum. This implies 
that the adjectives used must 
be able to describe the widest 
possible variety of entities. In 
ot her words, there is no place 
for detailed explication or 
definition. Therefore there 
can be no emotion. Since 
com pu ters are begi nn ing to 
infiltrate every aspect of our 
culture, including fantasy (as 
evidenced by video games). it 

Now we can 
detect a breast

Travel: As indespensable as Education 

Case in point are the 
hack rs, computer addicts, 
who are hopeI ssly devoted 
to algolrithms and debugging 
subroutines. The stereo· 
typical hacker lacks many of 
the ocial graces, and his 
emot ional barkbone deter· 
iorats to the point where it is 
distorted and disfigured. 
Love has little meaning to 
the hacker, and complex 
emot ions behind it have been 
buried under a mass of 
dispassionate integer adjec-
tives. A cynic would say. 
"the hacker loves his 
computer," but this defeats 
the purpose, si nce it adds 
another undescribable 
affection to the fam1i} 
already described by the 
word "love."

Computers themselves are 
indeed necessary in todays 
society, no doubt about that. 
[ am only lamenting what / 
sense to be the decay of the 
human eleme n t in the 
general popu lation. Society 
itself rewards those who can 
program a computer with 
secure futures, whi le those 
who try a nd unlock the 
barrier between language 
and emotion are left to 
scramble for the few 
opportunities in this area 
avai lable to them. When 
people such as Allen 
Ginsberg are revered as 
creative geniuses just becaue 
they used the word "fuck" in 
their pedestrian poetry, it is 
lime to realize the dearth in 
our collecti\'e creativit y and 
to t!ncourage the recogn it IOn 
of human emot ion . \{ecogni· 
lion is not the only solution. 
Each and everyone of us 
should ideally be able to 
express that emotion in a 
way \\hich co mmunicatt:'> 
more than a cliche like ... / 
Im'e you." I'm afraidlhal Iht:' 
basic skill i" lacking !Il most 
of our present day popu

l:(ml illlll'd from page 2 
to think how, if you'll pardon 
my morbidity, the Tioga death 
toll would rise in the even 
more stressful environment 
that would em,ue were we not 
allowed the (x:cassional relief 
and distraction of a TG or a 
game of Frisbee·to·music in 
the Muir quad. Parties and 
other activities accompanied 

. by music do not usually 
detract from but rather 
contribute to social interactIOn 
of the very kind Prof. Wills is 
sure we are destroying. As for 
his Freshman buddie:-., / 
suggest they find a nice quiet 
room on one of the upper floors 
of HSS or P&L. I have found 
the 5th floor faculty room of 
P&L to be impenetrable to 
blasts coming from bands 
practicing as nearby as / ISS 
~250. And what of the 5 
libraries on our campus? That 

i~, after all, what they're for. 
[ can only infer from Prof. 

Wilb' editorial that hewas in a 
state of rage induced by 
"infernal blasts" penetrating 
the confines of his office and 
write this in the hope that he 
can perhaps be as cogni7a nl of 
and apprecia te why listening 
to music is, for us, not a way to 
shock the middle class but an 
intcgral and necessary part of 
our life here on campus.

Laser Photography--------

A Chip History 
continued from pa~e 1 
preliminar} work several 
years ago and started to \\-ork 
full-tllne on the project in the 
mIddle of 19 2. 

Herman and McWilliams 
presented the research on May 
20th at an mternational laser 
research conference In 
Baltimore. 

" It was well-receIved." said 
Herman. "It repre~ents a 
majl)r tep and they (the 
sCIentists at the conference) 
felt that It was a major step ... a 
fairly ambItIOUS project" 

Herman IS a soft spoken man 
and. "omewhat typical of 
scientists. has a tendenc~ 
to\\ ards understatement. 
What makes the laser 
pantograph} project "faIrly 
ambitious" is the fact that it 
combines applted phYSICS. 
computer sCIence. and a brand-
ne\\ laser process In an 
attempt to create the fastest. 
most spohisticated computer 
hardware ever made. 

The long-term commercial 
benefits of laser pantograph} 
are staggertng. but the 
research team at LLNL IS now 
targettng their efforts towards 
a custom. speCIalized market. 
According to Herman. the 
goals of the project are: 
- Creattng "computers on a 
chIp." a term that sounds like 
a fast-food educational process 
which IS . in fact. the plaCIng of 
all necessary components on a 
single wafer of SIlIcon. This 
would eltmtnate the need to 
assemble many chIps Into a 
cohes l\e whole. therein' 
maKIng the compute'r 
comparitl\ely tiny and 
..,peeding both design and 
manufacturing. 
- One-step processing. Laser 
pantograph~ ellll11nate.., the 
complex steps needed in the 
currently employed photo-
lit hography process and 
ensure.., a higher YIeld of 
usable chIps. In fact. the laser 
can eifectin>ly ,;orrecl 

mIstakes as thc} happen. 
- The chip. and effecti\ ely 
t he entire computer. can be 
mod ified at wi ll before or 
du r ing Its manufacture. This 
a llows a single basic de"lgn to 
be modified to meet the needs 
of differen t applications. This 
is increasingl ~ important 
because a computer that can 
process a gi\'en type of 
information \'ery quilkly \\ III 
not process data of a dIfferent 
nature wilh the same speed 
As deSIgns become more 
complex and speeds Increase. 
tl IS compubory t hat each 
computer be carefully 
de"igned for Its specific task. 

Other laboratortes ha\'e 
developed different means of 
chip,imprtllting 111 the quest 
for f'ister and better 
computers One of those is 
electron- beam lit hography. 
whIch offers an impn)\ement 
over photo-Itthography. better 
resolutIOn. and some of the

and falls short 111 ano! her

Laser pantography allows 
all work to be done whtle the 
chips sit in a single. stationary 
envtnJOmenl. Thl: speeds 
work and Ic"sens t he chance 
that the chip be damaged or 
contaminated in handling. It 
can also be tested on-line. 
allowing instant correction.

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

Spring 1M Play-Offs 
Are Under Way' 

It's been a long year forthe legions of 
intramural athletes that have graced 
the playing courts and fields of UCSD. 
But before we start chasing summer 
exCitement and happiness this June, 
there's a bit of unfinished business 
back at the 1M Ranch. 

Traditionally, it's known as 1M Play-off 
Madness, but this time around It 
appears to have taken on a new 
demeanor. let's call It Talk Is Cheap 
Wuk at good of UCSD. 

Put It this way. BraggadaCio is In 
vogue on campus. If you listen to the 
200 some odd team captains that are 
still alive in the 1M Championship races 
we'll have about 199 team champion~ 
this spring. The only problem is .... we've 
only got room for 19 of them. That 
leaves a lot of egg on a lot of captain's 
faces. Oh well .... all of them will be able 
to quietly disappear into the sunset 
and lick their wounds over the summer. 
And no one will really remember come 
Fall '83 when everybody starts getting 
fired up all over again. A.ah, such is the 
joy of Championship Week at the Big 
·'U". 

Here's a brief look at the way the 
races stack up With the Budman's own 
personal selections for stardom 
champagne, and happiness. ' 

L 

Volleyball Play-Off Preview 

Men's A 
The 9Qm(S Tue/June 7 
Balls Out (13-11) vs Members (18-5) @ 815 pm 
Pineapple Boys (12-6) vs. Murphy's OptimiSts (17·7) (QlS15 
Blue (20-4) vs. Dlstrout (16-8) @ 9: 15 
Loud Team (17-6) vs. Inner Mixed (16-1) @ 915 

The Outlook RIC Lomibao's Inner Mixed Sandbaggers seem to 
have a leg up on the rest of the Men's A field. In good "bagglng' 
tradition, they continually downplay their obvious strengths in 
front of everyone, but let's face It...any team that goes 16-1 should 
be up another diviSion. Glenn Calta's veteran Balls Out squad 
pulled the shocker of the tournament with an impressive 3-set 
rout of top-seeded We Know the Ferg (19·2) on Tuesday night. 
These fell as Just might be a sleeper. Jay Kuo, the mighty mite mlni-
blocker on Pineapple Boys II, has hiS own version on the outcome 
of the play-ofts. " If Icouldonlyhit, we would crush the restof'em" 
he said modestly, Budman's Choice: Inner Mixed. ' 

Men'sM 
The Games 
All Quarterfinal Games Thu/ June 2 @ 9: 15 & 10: 15 pm 
(Top seeded teams include: Potato Heads (1 B-3), BananCl Blockers 
(17-4), Curtiss Interruptus (16-5), and Altered Memes (19-2) . 

The Outlook: Lots of interesting match-Ups in this division 
should produce some very exciting volleyball. Frank Nasworthy's 
Altered Memes has the best record but already is looking for 
excuses to bow out early, They'li have their hands full against the 
pounders from Bonsai (15-6) who have plenty of outside hitting 
strength. Curtiss Interruptus won each of their seven matches this 
season during league play and have plenty of seasoned veterans 
at all positions. Only a bad case of championship jitters can stop 
these guys. Budman's ChOice: Curtiss Interruptus. 

The Budman Delivers a Beauty 
Assistant 1M Director Scott Bernde~ 

and hiS Wife Jan.ce 'of Chern Dept. 
fame) made a major roster addition to 
their line·up thiS past Tuesday 

Brett Terrell Berndes, a 7 lb. 8h oz . 
switch hitting shortstop, was born to 
their proud parents at 2: 30 In the 
morning right after the bars closed. 

Totally relieved momma Jan named 
the young slugger after her three 
favOrite hitters of ali-time: George Brett, 
Ernie Terrell, and guess who. 

Poppa Scott who aSSisted at the 
btra inning affair (thiS one went 22 
hours of labor folks), took his usual 
position In the del/very room ... deep In 
the hole. And, as usual, he handled the 
little fella Without a bobble. 

On hiS entry into a brave new world 
U'I Brett proved to the a chip off the old 
block. His first words were aWfully 
familiar, "Hey, Dad, pop me CI Bud wili 
ya, that was a long haul In there!" 

Ultimate Disc Play-Off Preview 

After a two-week lay-off from flipping out, the Ultimate of 
Ultimates heats up thiS weekend In a chase for those coveted 
AMF/Volt Championship T-Shirts 

Early favOrites In each diVISion have already been established 
but as all good dtsco-ers know, a flip of the Wrist can turn any game 
around In a hurry 

_The .Early-Line Favontes 
Men M TWist & Crawl (4-0), Rastaman Vibration (4·1) 
Men A When the DISC Is Over (5-0), Mynan Barbarians (41), Dick's 

Tadpoles (3·0) 
Women Better luck ThiS Time (4-0), Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (4-1) 

All Ultimate DISC teams are encouraged to check the Intramural Information 
Board for the time and place of all play·off games Because of the rain-shortened 
season, nearly every team was placed In the Play-Off bracket. First round gClmes 
begin thiS SaturdClY, June 4th, Clnd continue through the weekend. All games Will 
be played on the Warren·East Field 

The Games 
AA Championship Killer (6·0) vs. Top Ramln (6-0) 
A Championship Semis High Strung (6-0) vs. Four In the Net (4-2) 
A Championship Semis Bad Mittens (5-1) vs Birds of a Feather (5-1) 

The Outlook: In by far the most competitive Team Badminton 
season ever, Monday night's (June 6) championship mCltches 
should be a thing of beauty. lloyd Chen's Kil ler quartet squeaked 
past the Battle Doors two Mondays ago 5·3 and may be in tough 
Ilgainst Alan Caserio 's Top Ramln four. 

In the "A " division, all four semifinalists struggled past their 
quarterfinal opponents, With two of them going down to total 
points accumulated. This one couldn't be any tougher to call, but 
after a few SIX-packs of hiS favonte suds our Budmlnton expert likes 
Susan Cuneo's Bad Mitten's to win It all, 

Men's Open 
Tl1~~$ 
Megacrushers (9-9) vs. Undertakers (&-14) 
Flying Zucchini (7-13) vs. Six Slama Jama (9-9) 
HIS Boy Elroy (13-4) vs. We Own Hendo (12-5) 

Wed/June 1 
@ 9:15 
@ 9:15 
(0) 10:15 

The Outlook: In a fairly competitive diVISion from top to bottom 
Jon Henderson's Elroys and Terry Snyder's Hendos appeClr to be i~ 
the driver's seat In thiS double elimination affair Both teams have 
good setters and excellent firepower from the outSide but their 
middle gClmes are a little suspect. Anthony Monaghan'; Zucchini 
Flyboys are the best bet CI) a ddrkhorse, Budman's Choice We 
Own Hendo. 

Women'sM 
The FaVOrites 
HB's (18·3) 
Momette (16-2) 
B-Ballers (14·1 ) 

The Outlook: ThiS diviSion could bOil down to a claSSIC athletic 
confrontation between the volleybal~smart HB's and the 
athletically-superior B-Ballers. Marianna Danilovlc has her HB's in 
excellent late season condition. They haven't been tested all 
season. Michelle Rubin's B-Ballers certainly know how to dribble 
and jump shoot, but digging and spiking are another matter. 
Budman's Choice: The HB's. 

Women's A 
~Favorites 
Good Try (20-1) 
Brown Smash (14-4) 
Spiked Fevers (10-S) 

The Outlook: The logical favorites to win thiS diVision seldom do 
for some reason. Christine Wang's Good Tryers mopped up in a 
weak league, but somehow don't seem to figure here. Gwen 
Gale's Fevers are a long shot, based on their tougher schedule but 
the beauties from Brown Smash are the ones to really watch. They 
lost a heartbreaker match to Good Try last month and are dying for 
a second chance. Budman's ChOice: Spiked Fevers.

Philadelphia ... But the real catalyst of the sweepwa: the series 
MVP, Moses Malone. If Julius Erving is known as the Doctor, 
lhen Moses has to be Chief Surgeon. The Philadelphia center, 
who was the first player to make the jump fro m high school to 
the pros, literally knifed his way through the Lakers, averaging a 
phenomenal 26.5 points and 19.5 rebounds in the series. He 
destroyed them on the board", and intimidated Kareem just 
enough to throw him off his game. Moses is indeed the best 
basketball player in the world (sorry, Larry Bird and Magic fans) 
and even though he makes over two million dollars a year, he is 
still underpaid . , . Will Kareem be traded? Throughout the pre s 
corps Tuesday, speculation ran rampant as most onlookers 
believed that the Laker center might be in New York next season. 
Although he can stil1 score at wil1, Kareem repeatedly gets 
outrebounded by opposing centers. He was clearly mismatched 
against Moses. and his defense was so pathetic that Mark 
Landsberger was guarding Moses the last two quarters of the 
title game ... If the Lakers can find a strong, rugged type center 
that would compliment their running "ty le more, then they 
should make the change, Besides. we're sure LA owner Jerry 
Bu ss wouldn't mind savingthemillion fivehewould have to fork 
out to re·sign the would-be free agent ... Although he has been 
frequentl y criticized, BiJly Cunningham dId a remarkable job 
molding the slxers into one of the all·time great basketball 
leams. It has been rumored that Cunningham will step down 
now that he has silenced his foremost critics by winning the big 
vile . .. Finally , what about thi" Philadelphia 76er team? Is it as 
great as everyone says it i,,? Afraid so. Dynasty is a word used 
frequently in footba Jl , baseball, and hockey, but there hasn't 
been a back-to·back world championship in ba<iketball since the 
Boston Celt ics in 1968 and '69. and the last real dynasty in the

to Red Aurebach's Celtics, lt's Harold Katz's Slxer", who 
conceivabl y cou ld win the mA crown for the next fIve year"i. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, Guess who IS the hottest 
team in baseball as of June 1. Los Angeles? Atlanta? Wrong Hr)\'. 
abou t SI. Louis? Nope The San Francisco Giant"i are the club 
that has been on fire for the past month. On May I , ;ylanager

a lack luster 5· 17 record. Since then, however, the Giants have 
been on a tear, winning 21 of their last 25 baJlgames, making 
them 26-21 o\oerall and only six and a half games back of the 
front-running Dodgers. If San Franci 'co can aVOId any serIOUS 
injuries, the Giants are silting pretty to win the division title for 
the first time since the Mays, McCovey , Marichal days of 1971.

TEAM OF THE WEEK 
SPONSORED BY m E MIllER BREWING COMPANY 



10 The UCSD Guardian Thursday, June 2, 1983 

By GREGORY MACCRONE 
Staff Writer 

With the advent of summer, 
the longer days, and the end of 
the school year, the int ra-
mural season slowly come to 
an end. The Memorial Day 
holiday combined with the fact 
that some of the sport sea ons 
have ended already made for 
minimal action this past week. 
But for those of you on the 
winning teams, the " econd 
season" is about to begin. 
Playoff schedules have been 
prepared by the 1M office, and 
playoff-bound team are 
encouraged to check the 
bulletin board in the 1M office 
for dates and times of playoff 
match-ups. 

This Week in Intratnurals action s tarts tonight, the Altered Momes will be trying to protect their impressive 19-
2 record. 

SOFTBALL 
Softball winds up this 

Saturday with all team ' 
whose playoff futures are 
pending on the outcomes of 
their game being told 
afterwards when, where and if 
to play their post-season 
action. Teams not playing on 
Saturday should be not ified by 
today about their playoff 
tatus. 

INNERTUBE WATER 
POLO 

The "second season" has 
already begun for the coed 
water polo teams thi year. 

Karl Takahashi of the Freak Brothers swings hard but missel';. 

The pride of single-A, More 
Wet Foxes , sportinga perfect 
10-0 record, took on the 
Swamp thi Tuesday with 
the result of this semifinal 
match unavailable at press 
time. In the other semifinal 
match, Stop the Bus 
confronted Dorks , again with 
the outcome unavailable at 
time of printing. We will 
report back on these games in 
a later issue. 

In AA semifinal action, the 
perenially tough Aqua Cows 
(24-5) were pit ted against 
Tube Babies (22-11), while 
Pump Twice and Shoot (23-
7) engaged Wet Panties (15-
8). The championship match-
up will take place Sunday, 
Jun e 5. 

MD Tubees II and SKLIF 
al 0 went at it , a did 
Gearheads and some 
unknown opponent in the 
semis of AAA water polo. The 
Gearheads have the mo t 
balanced attack in MA's two 
league with 81 points, cored 
and only 28 points allowed 
during the season. 
VOLLEYBALL 

There s hou ld be no 
s urprises in men's si ngle-A \'-
ball when considering teams 
with the likes of Inner 
Racially Mixed (14-2), We 
Know the Ferg (19-2), and 
Blue (18-3) for the cham-
pionship. The dark horse team 
and runner-up to Ferg in the 
;-.littany Lion League could 
well be the pack of Irish 
Setters, who ~port a 16-5 
record. 

In the women's single-A AA 
battle for supremacy, the 
teams to beat are the V, 
Bailers and Momette who 
have lost a total of only three 
games between I hem. the 
HB's (18·3) are the cream of 
the crop when peaking in 
lriclly AA terms. Momelte is

a varia tion of t he word 
"marne" which is "an archaic 
term for a blockhead," 
according to one "marne" 
follower. The marne clan, 
quite possibly, is on its way to 
becoming a dynasty in 1M 
sports, as they have fielded 
teams in a variety of sports. 

The Altered Momes , the 
male counterpart to Momette, 
leads a tough field of AA 
volley bailers including the 
1rojan league champs, 
Potato Heads (18-3), and the 
Aztec l eague c hampion

By JOHN Nff 
With the emphasis that has been placed on 

gaining a "higher" education in the post:war 
era, scholastic institutiuns have become little 
more than vocational schools. As can be seen 
in the boom in high technology .as an 
economic force and the populanty of 
engineering sciences as a focus for th.e 
majority of college undergraduates, there IS 
no doubt that the fine arts departments of 
UCSD have been overshadowed by the 
tendency to stress the sciences. 

In the eyes of the public and the rest of the 
university community, UCSD is merely a 
school where one IS able to "get mto 
computers." What is overlooked however is 
that UCSD has one of the most creative fine 
arts collectives in the world. In order to bring 
attention to these departments that are on the 
undergraduate level. a fes~ival has been 
organized to purvey the creatIve endeavors of 
UCSD students. .. 

As well as creating an exhIbItIOn that IS the 
first of its kind at UCSD, the visual arts 
departments have also brought together the 
music and drama departments who usually 
stage their own regular events. This year's 
Undergraduate Arts Festival has integra.ted 
within its framework the yearly drama festlv~1 
as well as programs from the musIc 
departments such as the Atomica~e (the 
emporium for composers of new musIc) ~nd 
the traditional performance by the Jazz 
ensemble under the direction of Jimmy 
Cheatham.

Undergrad Art festival 
Comes to 

UCSD 

In order to bring an event of this kind to 
UCSD it was necessary to establish the 
credibility of undergraduate arts within the 
framework of a largely technical university. 
The Birdcage Review was instrumental In 
educating department heads to the fact that 
an extensive arts community exists on this 
campus. 

Moira Roth,the head of the Visual Arts 
Department after reviewing the Birdcage, 
enlisted the help of Muir provost John Stewart 
in organizing the festival. To establish the Arts 
Festival major financial considerations had to 
be dealt with. Provost Stewart played a major 
role in this task as well as acting as chairman. 

There were three major sources of funding 
that were used to organize the festival: The 
Chancellors Associates, The Counsel of 
Provosts and the Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Affairs, Joe Watson all 
arranged for funding for the festival. The AS 
also funded approximatJey one thousand 
dollars towards the festival. 

Aside from bringing an awareness to the 
outside community of UCSD's involvement in 
the arts the Undergraduate Arts Festival has 
also brought a line of communication 
between the Art departments of UCSD that did 
not exist before. 

This interaction has promoted an artistic 
rapport that would not have come about 
without the festival. Dance students are now 
approaching music students in order to better 
express themselves artistically. 

When the festival was in the planning stages 

~ .......... . -
.... _ . ... .. 

there was a good deal of reluctance between 
the departments which had already 
established events such as the drama and 
dance festivals that have taken place on 
campus for the past several years with a good 
deal of success. This unwillIngness was soon 
abandoned when it became apparent . that 
there would be many advantages to havmg a 
unified undergraduate arts festival 
representing the collective efforts of the 
departments. 

The problem of gaining exposure ,for an 
undergraduate artist is generally a ~Iffic.ult 
task to deal with at such a large unIversIty. 
The Atomicafe is a prime example of the 
exposure problem. Despite ,the techni~1 
advancement of UCSD's expenmental musIc 
facilities the forum to exhibit music is usually 
reserved for graduate students. The 
Undergraduate Arts festival has changed this 
to a certain extent. Within the framework of 
the Atomicafe this week there will be a greater 
allotment of space devoted to undergraduate 
compost ion, . 

Although it has yet to begm, the art;s 
festival i already a tremendous success: It I 
giving much needed exposure to UC. D art 
programs as well as developIng an 
Interdepartmental relationship that has been 
lacking for far too long. 

By bringing together the variou other. art 
departments, the Undergraduate Art Fe tlval 
has created an expanded venue in which the 
play of the drama department can reach a 
larger audience and more mu idan are able

UCSD Champagne Season goes flat 
'Shawl' ;s end 
of Drama year 

By JAN BRfSlAUER 

The 1982-8.3 Drama season 
opened with the dismally un-
Brechtian Threepenny Opera, a 
costly disappointment. Contrast 
this with Alan Schneider's 
fabulous Pieces of Eight. the 
delight of the year by any 
standard. 

Which show received the bulk 
of the drama department 
resources, not to mention the 
Weiss Theatre? Proving once 
again that misappropriation 
reigns supreme, it was 
Threepenny Opera. We have a 
new facility and a talented class 
of first-year graduate actors. If 
the season has been wanting -
and it has - the problem stems 
not from a lack ofresources, but 
from impudent allocation (read 
who directs what where) and a 
problematic menu of plays. 

Spring quarter has been 
much like the year as a whole, a 
few bright spots amid the bad 
and worse. The four shows rank 
as follows: Pinter 's The 
Caretaker a severe misfortune: 
The Trial and Hoon on a 
Rainbow Shawl (currently 
running - about which more 
later) more bad than good: and 
Guare's Landscape of the Body 
the only one to offer food for 
hope. 

Let The Caretaker (directed 
by Jon Dichter) serve to warn 
students of drama what not to 
do. Pinter's volatile script was 
shamelessly defused, its 
precision and subtlety lost. The 
set got in the way of the action, 
or rather, it was impossible to 
tell if the actors' complete lack 
of movement was due to the 
confining space or Dichter's 
lack of directing. 

The extended use of 
blackouts was both annoying 
and awkward as were the mixed 
English and American accents 
of the alleged brothers. The 
saving grace was the 
performance of actor Joss 
Bennathan, who is always a 
delight to watch and whose 
presence could redeem any

What a strange disease it is 

that strikes us all and convinces 
us that we are or will be great 
poets and writers. It must be 
indicative of our society that we 
place such a high value on the 
image of a renegade poet who is 
free enough to care about what 
matters and wise enough to 
disregard the trivialities of daily 
existence, 

Once in a while there is a 
publication that comes along 
and snaps our delusions by 
pushing us into the realm of art 
we often are afraid to encounter. 

Roadwork 8 is such a 
publication whose tight-knit 
cohesiveness and daring style is 
unafraid to shake the reader's 
inner secret, It begins 
unabashedly with an untitled 
poem by EddyTucker which sets 
a mood whose strength lies in 
the utomost importance of 
simple things. Tucker seems 
somehow to sacrifice the entire 
po m for the sake of the \\Iorks 
that follow, Don 't mht.1ke what I

show. 
Pearson's The Trial (his 

adaptation and direction) was 
fast-food Kafka, the kind of 
Reader's Digest rendition that 
gives American versions a bad 
name. The gimmicks weren 't 
many but they were the same 
throughout. The story of Joseph 
K., arrested on his thirtieth 
birthday for the commission of 
crimes unknown, became 
mostly tedium. f J. Pratt and 
Corey Hansen were as good here 
as they were in Pieces of Eight. 
no small accompl ishment under 
much less distinguished 
direction. 

Landscape of the Body was a 
clever choice of play, blending 
film noir with the proverbial 
whodunit. The end result was 
not as funny as it might have 
been but it was a well-
orchestrated , ambitious 
production. Sure there were 
problems with pacing here and 
there and quite a range in the 
abilities of the actors, but it was, 
after all, a lot to handle with 
many performers and many sets. 

There were some genuinely 
funny moments and some great 
acting (keep an eye especially 
on Marceline H ugot and 
possibly John Rosen ). Michael 
Greif shows promise as a 
director, 

This quarter has been much 
like the year as a whole, and the 
show currently running is par 
for the 'Wrongs of Spring'. Errol 
John's 1'100n on a Rainbow 
Shawl is not an exciting play, 
We have here a mediocre script. 
and a lackluster production , 
Nonetheless, the choice to do 
1'100n is the obligation to do it 
with enthusiasm and insight 
and this show is, in both 
respects, inadequate, What 
power there is to be had is lost 
- no socio-political lessons 
and none of the atmosphere of 
the Carribean. The play is, on 
one level. an exposee of social 
mores and relationships - a 
soap-opera with calypso - but 
it has potential to be-more than 
that. 

While part of the duty of 
criticism is to transcend one's 

own bias - I tend to read 
politics into everything - this 
duty need not apply when the 
occasion truly calls for such 
comment. Port of Spain 
Trinidad shortly after the 
Second World War - where and 
when the play is set - suggests 
a panoply of political 
controversies to warm the heart 
of many a Marxist social critic. 

Of central concern in this 
drama is the fate of those who 
can escape the poverty and 
those who cannot. They might 
for example, have given some 
indication of the governance of 
the Carribean in the 1940s and 
'50s or of the influence of 
industrialization - maybe 
some political propoganda or, 
as the script suggests, the 
shadow of unfinished steel and 
concrete buildings in the 
background, John provides 
several invitations to consider 
the problem, but none in this 
ensemble takes the cue (and 
dramaturg ~than ought to pay 
praticular attention hereI) 

The worst pa rt ot 1'100n 011 a 

Roadwork 8 treads new ground 
'ii1y, though, since no other work 
that follow could possibly have 
stood solidly as the first work 
presented. 

following is William Keim 's 
excerpt from " Women, a work in 
progress" which sets images of 
thoughts and scenes in such 
continuous motion that they 
cease to be individual and 
become a single haunting 
collage that lingers in the 
mind 's eye like a dream upon 
awakening, 

Donald Wesling's " Three 
Heracleitean Poems," closes the 
gap that eparates the sexes by 
offering a males view that is 
rather mysteriously different 
and despairingly close to the 
previou'i works, Wesling 's poem 
invokes a saddened retrospec-
tive tone as though remember 
illg a tragedy and being unable 
to forget it again. 

Often these works probt'd 

deeper than I had anticipated 
and I had to shy away to regain 
my composure. 

The poetry in Roadwork 8 
details the individual's struggle 
for identity amongst despair 
and the poetry becomes, as 
Deborah Harding in " Pain Uke a 
Mirror" writes: "They try to burn 
the pain/ like sticks./They try to 
hold the pain /with one hand 
like a mirror./They try to hold 
it/at a distance from dying," 

It is Christopher Leland in 
"Drifting Down In Dago" that 
tries to slip away from thoughts 
that haunt his sleep, but 
Jacqueline Cicchetti "outh 
Side of Brooklyn " show that 
even if e ape were wanted in 
dire straits, it is not possible to 
obtain it. 

The mo~t fearful work of all is 
Jan 1011 kyi· 'Letters from 
Poland ' with its day to day 
occurrcnces bCloming 

distorted and somewhat 
perverted and where escape i 
never po sible This work 
captivated me with images from 
circumstances I could only 
vaguely relate to. Reading this 
lonescoian work four times 
failed even to reduce my alVe as 
absurdity and reality mingled 
together in my urreali t mind 
while trying to grope for

Sionskyi s work is extremely 
lVell done and who e trength

on no othcr work in Roadwork

else in Roadwork 8 except 
.. L 'Uer from Poland you will 
still come away impre'iSCd and 
satisfied at having the chance to 
look deeper into '>Oll1eon(' than 
we all normally do. The 
10nclll1e\S and pain betom(' our 
mIll (or a short whik. 

Rainbow Shawl. is its lack of 
atmosphere. If this is Trinidad, it 
surely doesn't show; I feel 
absolutely no island rhythm. 
The production is all too clean, 
every costume neat and pressed 
and not one character sweats, 
Theirs is, at best. a Walt Disney 
conception of poverty. 

The use of light and music is 
hasty and sporadic, the very 
resources which could bring out 
the sensual. erotic flow of the 
carribean. The set is visually 
stimulating and professional. 

Maria Porter is competent as 
the down-trodden mother and 
Sherlynn Hicks brings vitality to 
the role of Mavis. Tony Dee 
Winters is charming and Phillip 
C. Curry is convincing if a bit too 
even, Otherwise the cast has the 
iron-poor blood that runs 
rampant through this 
production. The first act is 
boring: acts two and three do 
pick up considerably.

OPENS JUNE 3rd AT A 
SELECTED THEATRE NEAR YOU 

6 ffiatus June 2, 1983 

New exhibit 
at UCSD is 
'interesting' 

By ROBERT lLOrfE 
The smell of new paint wafts 

from the open gallery doors, 
signaling that the Mandeville 
Art Gallery once again hasa new 
exhibit. 

The current co ll ection , 
ent itled New Epiphanies: 
Religious Contemporary Art, 
will run until June 26, and has 
some very interesting pieces as 
well as some repeats. 

The most traditional piece is 
an icon by Konstantine Pilarinos 
entitled " Byzantine Wood-
sculpture". The traditional 
imagery and the exquisite 
woodcarving counter-balance 
Howard Finster's purposely 
crude execution of his meaning-
filled works. 

Another almost traditional 
image is Pedro Perez's " God," 
inspired (apparently) by the 
great jeweled reliquary crosses 
of Europe and Latin America, 
containing in it's center an 
image of God which the cata log 
for the exhibit describes as 
" resembling MAD's Alfred E, 
Neuman . . . " but with 
disquieting fangs. 

Next to the Perez piece is 
another cross inspired by 
continental models, Tom 
Mationi's " Cross:' an etching 
that resembles the Hoor plan of 
a cathedral. Yet with its spread 
extremities, seems also to be a 
stylized representation of the 
crucifixion of Jesus, with spread 
fingers, and a crown of thorns. 

Miroslav Antic 's untitled 
piece is a work which one 
should keep one's distance 
from. The neon tubes hurt the 
eyes. 

Religious art is alive and well , 
and predominantly Christian, at 
UCSD's Mandeville art gallery. 

Atomicafe 
in concert 
on Monday 

At 8 pm Monday, Atomicafe 
will feature another intriguing 
and unusual concert of music by 
UCSD composers. A wide variety 
of instrumentation is featured, 
as well as differing approaches 
to both the craft of composition 
and the configuration of 
performance. 

Nicholas Verin will offer "Duo 
for Bass and Tape" featuring 
contrabass virtuoso Mark 
Dresser, who soon departs for 
Italy on a Fulbright Scholarship. 
Verin's work succeeds in 
bringing together stylistically 
diverse elements. Georges 
Bloch , another French 
composer, presents "Suite in 
Three Parts" for guitar. 

Tanya Rust will perform in her 
own "Tuba Piece," which 
employs acoustic and 
electronically amplified sound. 
lIer composition explores the 
border between pitch and noise, 
and definite pitches contained 
within noise. 

An unusual " spacial 
intermission piece" entitled 
"Q8M 1 {)4H.3N I" will feature 
rive players.

at the Mandeville Recital Hall

Opera group closes 
season on a high note 

Sy JAMfS RALPH PAPr 
from the memory. It is a river of 
music which almost entirely 
circumvents the emotions. To 
hear this opera is to enjoy it. but 
not to be strock with it. 

Great performing artists are 
otten given "vehicles" for their 
genius. The greatest performing 
artists don 't need them, and 
Dame Joan Sutherland comes 
under this category, for she 
manages to exhibit her genius 
in even as ruthlessly si lly an 
opera as Adriana Lecouvreur. 
The San Diego Opera produced 
it last week, and it is entirely 
worth seeingjust for Dame Joan 
making it sensible and even 
tragic to sniff a bouquet of 
poisoned violets and finally get 
around to dying about half an 
hour later (n ot without 
attempts in between ). 

In the end, one is forced to 
concentrate on its elegance, 
because that is what appeals. 
The place is Paris and the time 
1730, and in what other 
situation would the elegant 
gesture of poisoning someone 
with a bouquet of violets occur 
to a murderer? Dame Joan plays 
the leading lady of the Comedie 
Francaise (arriving in a 
ballroom of a dress in deep bl ue 
silk with a turban crowned by 
gold ostrich feathers dissolving 
into a veil of golden gauze ), and 
she is in love with Maurizio, who 
is really the Count of Saxony, 
and he is pretending to court 
the Princess of Bouillon (whose 
husband is in love with Mlle. 
Duclos, who is Adriana 's artistic 
rival. appearing with her at the 
Comedie Francaise, stage 
managed by Michonnet. who 
loves Adriana, ect., ect.). 

Joan Sutherland leads a brilliant cast in SO Opera's final performance of the season. 

However, there is more. 
Adriana Lecouvreur has 
delightful melodies (and it is 
almost like a symphony in the 
way It uses repetition and 
variation of the same tunes 
throughout a movement. or 
even throughout the whole 
opera). Francesco Cilea writes 
music that gurgles along, 
sometimes comically, some-
times tragically, with different 
speeds and textures of watery 
movement. but always prettily 
and picturesquely Howing away

British ska followers will have 

a unique opportunity to dance 
to live performances by the 
Beat. The Selecter, Madness, and 
the Specials. No, they won't be 
playing here at UCSD. Get real. 
They will be on strips of 
celluloid film that will be 
projected on a large screen in 
the UCSD Gym. 

The film is entitled Dance 
Craze, and will be shown Friday 
at 9 pm. An enormous dance 
floor will be cleared so that 
people can ska, marimba, cha-
cha, pop, and do the Smurf to 
the tunes from the film. 
Admission is free with student 
ID. 

The film Dance Craze is the 
documentation of the British 
" Ska" mov ement that 
originated in the early eighties. 
It features some of the best 
talent from Britain in live 
performances. An album by the
