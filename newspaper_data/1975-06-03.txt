Committee Substantial Support Expected for Work 
SR~kffirmsL Stoppage; Action Opposed by Some T As. trl e ntent _ by Richard Yep 

The steering committee of the 
Graduate Student Union 
yesterday submitted a proposal to 
the full Union that would reaffirm 
the GSU's intent to stage a work 
stoppage today and tomorrow at 
UC San Diego. 

At press time, it was expected 
that the GSU would accept the 
resolution, which calls for grad 
students to perform no work of 
any kind during the two-day 
strike. 

In addition, the GSU was 
expected to discuss its planned 
teach-i n and rally today and 
tomorrow, respectively, each at 
noon in the Revelle plaza. 

Staff Writer 
The Graduate Student Unim (GSU) hegms a "work stoppage" 

today to protest budget cats that would reduce the resources 
a val able tq teachilg a ssistants and to urge the adq>tion of GSU 
demams by the Governor and the legislature. 

Last Tuesday, the GSU voted unanimously to hold the work 
stoppage today and tomorrow after meeting with Chancellor 
McElroy last week. McElroy blamed the Governor's 1975-76 UC 
budget mr the reduction of TA resources. 

The strike is expected to gain substantial support from graduate 
T As . GSU spokesman Joe Rodgers speculated that between 500 and 
1000 studPJlts would come to the teach-in today at noon on the Revelle 
Plaza, where the T As will group together and show their support. 

Demands 
The GSU is demanding a minimum 50% T A employment for every 

graduate student, for the length of that student's program, contracts to 
be signed in the spring of the previous school year the graduate is to be 
hired which would be binding for the entire academic year, a student- Members of the steering committee of the Graduate Student

way is through full support," said a philosophy department TA . 

In an informal Triton Times survey, it appeared that the philosophy 
department" As felt that today's strike would be "quite widespread," as 
one spokesman said. 

I t has been reported (see article, this page) that the humanities 
department (which comprises the literature, philosophy, and history 
faculty) was contemplating a plan to replace the current requirement 
of three essays to a mid-term, a short essay and a final exam'ination, 
virtually eliminating any composition writing. 

When informed of this proposal, the philosophy T A said, "My ex-
perienc.e is that students aren't equipped with the necessary verbal 
skills to be able to write in upper division courses . It is essential the 
student learn to write as soon as possible." 

The mathematics department has the highest percentage (75% ) of 
total T As who belong to the GSU . A mathematics T A said he thought 
that about 20 T As of the possible 44 or 45 would strike today. 

More Security 
"I'm beginning to feel that the situation has to be corrected . We 

need more security. Not all our emphasis is on the monetary aspect -
it's also to improve education," said a spanish literature T A. 

Most TAs in the chemistry department appeared to be against the 
work stoppage, claiming they "couldn' t understand why the other TAs 
were striking the campus, when they should be lobbying in UC 
President Hitch's or McElroy's office." 

One chemistry T A said he didn't care where the money came from, 
' ~he department would provide for the T As." 

Another chemistry TA said, "It is just no use to strike against our 
faculty ." 

Cutback~ in lab sections of 43 % have been predicted by the 
Chemistry department. 

Joe -Rogers, a spoiesman for Three members of the literature department felt the work stoppage

feelings up. "It is important to see ~hat the fight for mor~ TAs isn't only 
for graduates, but is important to the undergraduates and the school as

I n response to news of a 
possible 43% cutback in
