CHAMPAIGN, III -
University of Illinois student 
Sean Harte pled guilty to 
charges of misdemeanor theft 
on Tuesday for not returning 
the 174 books he had bor-
rowed from the university's 
library. Prior to his arrest, 
Hane did not return the books 
despite requests from the 
library and the university 
police. On Nov. 20, 1998, 
police executed a search war-
rant and discovered the 174 
books. as well as eight stolen 
books. Police said that Harte 
had been stealing the books for 
two years. As pan of his plea, 
Harte will have to undergo 
psychological evaluation, and 
he is banned from the campus.

Alumni Fr .. 
Trapped Students 
HANOVER. N.H. - Seven 
Dartmouth College alumni 
helped rescue four UC 
Berkeley students after they 
were trapped under an 
avalanche at Donner Summit 
in northern California last 
Sunday. The Berkeley stu-
dents were sledding down a 
small hill when they were hit 
by an avalanche and buried 
under six feet of heavy snow. 
One of the students, Harry 
Eichelberger. freed himself 
and went to get help. He ran 
to a Darthmouth Outing Club 
cabin nearby. There. the 
alumni gathered rakes, 
brooms and mops to use as 
tools to free the other three 
victims who were stuck near-
ly two hours in the snow. The 
four were taken to a local 
hospital for treatment for 
hypothermia.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. -
Florida community college 
students will be able 10 earn 
bachelor's degrees without 
having to go to a four-year 
university if a proposed bill 
in the Florida Legislature is 
passed this year. In recent 
years, legislators and educa-
tional leaders have expressed 
concern that four-year 
degrees are not accessible 
enough and that four-year 
institutions have become too 
crowded. If the bill passes, it 
would create a working rela-
tionship between community 
colleges and four-year col-
leges. Interested community 
colleges would either be pro-
vided teachers from four-year 
state universities, or state 
schools could teach classes to 
community colleges via dis-
tance learning.

Educational Outreach 
CA .... OAP: Program allows 
undergraduates to help children 
attain a higher education 
By Marjorie Montemayor 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to expose disadvantaged grammar 
school and high school students to local colleges 
and universities, some UCSD students are partic-
ipating in a statewide program that helps children 
recei ve assistance for education after high 
school. 

The California Student Opportunity and 
Access Program (Cal-SOAP) is designed to work 
'directly with students at the elementary to high 
school level by providing them with information 
and services for pursuing a post-secondary edu-
cation. 

"We give a core neutral stance on education," 
says Linda Doughty, director of the San Diego 
branch of Cal-SOAP. "We always try to push the 

four-year [colleges] firs!. And if the kids are UC 
eligible we will push the four-year [colleges] 
firs!. We do push the UC system, CSU, commu-
nity colleges. We push all of the entities." 

The program is staffed by a team of educa-
tional professionals and college students. 

Although the program is open to all students, 
it focuses on students who do not have college 
resources easily available to them. These stu-
dents may come from geographical areas that 
have a documented low college-bound popula-
tion. low-income households or they may be the 
first in their families to allend college. 

The academic enrichment division of Cal-
SOAP provides K-12 students and their parents 
with services ranging from SAT. workshops to 
the America Reads Initiative, a literacy program 
in which undergraduates tutor students in read-
ing. College undergraduates who work in the 
academic enrichment sector tutor the students in 
various subjects, such as math, English and the

Atkinson: TA 
Concerns To 
Be Addressed 
LETTER: UC President states 
that TAs are still not eligible for 
collective bargaining rights 

By Vincent Gragnani 
Senior Staff Writer 

UC President Richard Atkinson issued a 
leller last Friday regarding last Decemher's 
teaching assistant (TA) strike and the talk~ 
that resulting from i!. In the leller, Atkinson 
stated that he still believes that TAs are not 
eligible for collective bargaining. However. 
in the leller. he also stated that the universi-
ty will address some concerns raised hy 
graduate students. 

Atkinson stated that as an educational 
institution, the University of California mu~t 
ensure that a mentoring relationship exists 
between graduate students and professors. 
He added that he believes collective bar-
gaining for TAs would disrupt that relation-
ship. 

. "We are, first and foremost, an educa-
tional institution, and there arc few relation-
ships that are unaffected by this central 
fact," Atkinson said. "In the future, as in the 
past, any discussion of collective bargaining 
with teaching assistants must recognize this 
fundamental educational relationship." 

Ricardo Ochoa, president of the 
Association of Graduate Student Employees/ 
United Auto Workers (AGSElUAW) at UC 
Berkeley, said that Atkinson's leller does not 
contain any new information. He also said 
that the university is not acknowledging the 
Dec. 14. 1998 decision by the state Public 
Employment Relations Board (PERB). 
which declared that UCLA TAs are eligible 
for collective bargaining. 

"It seems that the university is just recy-
cling an old statement," Ochoa said. "They 
are rehashing an old position. They seem to 
be ignoring the fact that they lost a legal 
case." 

PERB has scheduled an election for 
March 9-11, in which the UCLA TAs will 
decide whether to be represented by a union. 

Atkinson's leller also stated that the uni-
versity is basing its position upon a 1992 
decision by the California Court of Appeals, 
which stated that TAs are not eligible for 
collective bargaining. Atkinson said that the 
university is asking the Court of Appeals to 
review the PERB decision. 

Ochoa said that PERB may order elec-
tions to be held at other campuses, including 
UCSD. 

'"[he only way they [UC administration) 
can get out of [the election] is by arguing 
that TAs at UCSD are doing different work 
than TAs at UCLA." Ochoa said.

Association of Student EmployeeslUnited

BRIEFLY ••• 

UCSD Receives $1 Million Grant 
Due to a $1 million grant from Hewlett-Packard 

Company's HP Laboratories, UCSD researchers in the 
department of computer science and engineering will 
work to improve high-performance systems created 
from PC server clusters. 

From Intemet Service Providers who host hundreds 
of customer websites to banks that process millions 
of financial transactions, use of high-performance sys-
tems is increasing. 

Information techno~ departments can build high-
performance systems by joining PC servers in a cluster 
to act as a single, very powerful computer. The HP-
sponsored UCSD research project aims to ill1ll'OYe the 
performance of these server clusters by increasing 
their reliability and availability through simpler and less-
expensive conf.gurations. In this context, availability 
means the time it takes to provide a computing service. 

Over the next three years, Andrew Chien, professor 
of computer science and engineering at the Jacobs 
School of Engineering and principal investigator of the 
study, will work with a research team to improve the 
performance of both design software and hardware 
architecture. 

Chien's work is also supported by Intel 
Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Platform 
Computing, Tandem Computing and numerous federal 
agencies.

Scripps Researcher Dies 
OBnuIIY: Professor is 
remembered by friends 
for being a warm and 
amiable person 

Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (SIO) researcher 
Benjamin Volcani - who is credit-
ed with discovering life In the Dead 
Sea and pioneering biological sili-
con research - died last Saturday 
due to complications related to kid-
ney failure. He was 84. 

Volcani, who was a professor 
emeritus of marine biology at SIO, 
joined UCSD's faculty in 1959 and 
maintained his lab until 1996, when 
he was forced to stop working due 
to health concerns. 

During his career at SIO, 
Volcani and his research group dis-
covered the biologically active role 
that silicon plays in basic life 
processes through his work with 
diatoms - single-celled aquatic 
plants that make up the base of the 
marine food chain. 

"Ben was the first to show that 
silicon is essential for DNA synthe-
sis in diatoms," S)O marine biolo-
gy Professor Victor Vacquier said. 
''That is very important because 
diatoms play a critical role in the 
food chain in the ocean." 

Volcani also was the first to 
demonstrate that silicon was bio-
logically active. He spent much of 
his last 35 years of research 
focused on various aspects of the 
biological roles of silicon. 

Mark Hildebrand, a research 
associate who worked with VQlcani, 

TA: Rhodes says 
that university is 
shifting the blame

UAW. 

"During the meetings, the 
University attempted to raise with 
the union the concerns of the grad-
uate students, but the UAW was not 
willing to discuss these topics 
unless the university formally rec-
ognized ihe union as the exclusive 
bargaining agent for teaching assis-
tants," Atkinson said. 

Rhodes said that she believes

said that Volcani's work has been 
critical to the study of silicon. 

"1 think everyone in the ficld 
agrees that if it weren't for Ben's 
tenacity in sticking to the problem 
we wouldn't be anywhere ncar 
where we are today in the field of the 
biology of silicon." Hildebrand said. 

Hildebrand also said that one of 
Volcani's main priorities was to 
keep his lab well-funded in order to 
further his research. He said that 
Volcani was able to obtain funding 
needed for his lab because of his 
reputation, as well as his amiable 
personality. 

"Everyone knew he was very 
personable and that he was doing 
good work," Hildebrand said. 

Hildebrand also said that 
Volcani was an energetic and dri-
ven character. He said that this 
a!>pect of his personality led to suc-
cess in his work. 

"Ben really had two outstanding 
careers. The first was with research 
on life in the Dead Sea, and then 
his later work with silicon," 
Hildebrand said. "That's really 
rare. and the reason he could do 
that was because he was so focused 
as a person." 

Vacquier. who had know 
Volcani since he arrived at UCSD, 
said that although many knew 
Volcani because of research, hc 
also was well-known for his per-
sonality. 

"He was a wonderfully warm 
person. and he really liked people." 
Vacquier said. "People wcre his 
thing as much as science was," 

Vacquier also said that although 

the university is unfairly shifting 
the blame onto the union members. 

"For them to claim that the 
union is bad because we wouldn't 
talk about working conditions is 
turning the situation on its head," 
Rhodes said. ''They are the ones 
who won't negotiate with us." 

Sworder said that the university 
wanted to discuss specific work-
related issues during the talks. 

"I think there was a hope that 
the meetings would lead to a clear 
sense of the issues they wished to 
address," Sworder said. "The focus 
of the UAW is recognition first and 
substantial issues later. That makes 

Volcani enjoyed his work, he was 
mo~t happy when he spent time 
with people. He said that Volcani 
always enjoyed talking to visitors 
toSIO. 

"He knew a lot of things. but 
what he really enjoyed was peo-
ple," he said. "He would rather talk 
to them than do anything." 

Vacquier also said that he will 
never forget Volcani's presence in 
his life. 

"If I hadn't known him, it 
would've been a loss for me," 
Vacquier said. 

Born in 1915 in Ben-Shemcn in 
what is now Israel. Volcani 
received his master's of science 
degree in microbiology from 
Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 
1936. In the ~ame year, he discov-
ered that the Dead Sca - which is 
known for its inability to sustain 
life due to high salt content in the 
water - supports several types of 

microogani~ms, which are now 
classified as halophilic - "salt-
loving" - archaehacteria. 

His work on Dead Sea microor-
ganisms was the focus of his 
research from 1936 to 1945 and 
was the theme of his doctoral the-
sis. Volcani received the first doc-
toral degree in microbiology to be 
awarded by Hebrew University and 
wrOle the first doctoral thesis in 
Hebrew. 

Volcani is survived by his wife 
of 50 years. Toni Volcani; a son, 
Yanon Volcani; a daughter-in-law, 
Rory Divine, and a grandson, 
Doron Volcani, all of w~om live in 
La, Jolla. 

it difficult to address the issues." 
Sworder said that elections at 

UCLA will probably go on as 
planned unless thc Court of 
Appeals reviews the PERB ruling, 
which cannot take place without 
the consent of PERB. 

Rhodes said that because elec-
tions have been ordered at UCLA, 
she feels that the movement toward 
union recognition is nearing its end. 

"The momentum we gained 
from the strike, the campus com-
munity and support from the state 
legislators is really encouraging," 
Rhodes said. "We've always 
known it was just a matter of time."

Administration Continually 
Neglects Student Needs 

In May of 1997. the Guardian reported an antici-
paled UCSD over-enrollment and housing shortage 
for the upcoming academic year ("UCSD 
Miscalculates 1997-98 Demand." May 12). At the 
time. UCSD administrators faced a crisis in accom-
modating the educational, financial and habitational 
needs of current and incoming UCSD students. 

Two years later, the headlines have barely 
changed. The housing shortage continues, now 
accompanied by serious parking shortages during 
peak university hours. 

In the meantime. administrators have been all talk 
and no action. Though the housing crisis has been 
mounting for some time, they have done nothing 
other than push papers and squeeze more students 
into already existing spaces. 

Now. one potential solution includes denying a 
housing guarantee to transfer students in their first 
year at UCSD. Even though these students would 
have worked hard to attend this university, they would 
be denied on-campus housing and the opportunity to 
truly become a part of the UCSD community. 

Revelle Provost Thomas Bond said that the hous-
ing shortage has occurred "in a very short period of 
time" ("Committee Proposes New Apartments," 
Guardian, Feb. 4. 1999). To university officials, two 
years may seem brief. However, for students, two 
years is halfway to graduation. Administrators must 
take action quickly in order to serve the students 
instead of merely putting a Band-Aid on this long-
term wound. 

Though the situation has been dire for some time, 
current students are still being crammed into inade-
quate spaces. The university is squeezing three peo-
ple into double rooms, five people into a four-person 
apartment, as well as utilizing temporary housing. 
Though the university will begin construction on a 
new parking structure this summer, additional stu-
dent housing will not be available until 2002 when 
the new Eleanor Roosevelt College housing is 
expected to open its doors. 

While a UCSD housing committee i's tossing 
aro'und the idea of building a new apartment complex 
in the spring of 2000, it has yet to decide important 
issues such as types of rooms and density of housing. 
Furthermore, Assistant Vice Chancellor of Planning 
and Construction Jeff Steindorf said at a recent A.S. 
Executive Committee on Parking meeting that UCSD 
will probably not meet its eventual goal of housing 
50 percent of undergraduates. 

UCSD follows a master plan designed in the 
1980s, which allows for campus growth, including 
the eventual expansion to up to eight colleges. In the 
push for expansion, however, the UCSD' administra-
tion must keep the best interests of both its current 
and future students in mind at all times . It is unethi-
cal to take students' money, cram them into a univer-
sity and then not give proper attention to their needs. 

Props and Flops 
Props to the Triton Tide for increasing school 

pride and making UCSD a greater. more spirited 
campu~. Keep us shouting!

WHITE HOUSE COULD USE A 
FEMALE IN THE OVAL OFFICE 

COMMENTARY: 
The United States needs 
a woman to clean up the 
nation and the presidency 
By Nllou MOItoft 
Staff Writer 

Either way you look at it, what the 
president did was wrong. Just because 
adultery has been in practice by our 
government officials for such a long 
time dbes not make it OK. In fact, I 
think it is about time we cleaned house. 

So far, the United States has suc-
ceeded in becoming a great, if not the 
greatest, power in the world. We have 
succeeded in fighting our way out of the 
colonial gutter and creating a democrat-
ic constitution. which has become the 
inspiration for many aspiring democra-
cies around the world. We have suc-
ceeded in building our military into the 
most awesome possessor of advanced 
weaponry. We have even succeeded in 
interfering in world politics with our 
arrogance, our democracy and our mili-
tary strength a~ justifiable cause to cre-
ate peace. What we have not succeeded 
in doing is placing a woman on the pres-
idential throne. 

While a female president may not 
necessari Iy cleanse the system, she 
COl,ld bring some added insight into the 
job. Either way, it is not like she could 
do any worse or be any more corrupt 
than some of our past presidents. 

Today. we have many innuential 
women in politics who can step up to 
bat. Lately there has been some contro-
versy over who wi II he the candidates 
for the 2000 presidential elections. 

The unanimous choice for the 
Democratic Party, so far, is AI Gore. 
With Richard Gephardt dropping out 
of the nominations to run for Speaker 
of the House and Sen. Bill Bradley as 
the only other representative, most 
Democrats are placing all their eggs in 
the vice president's environmentally

safe basket. The Republican Party 
doesn't seem to have much of a choice 
either with Dan "Look, Mom, I can 
spell potato" Quayle as a nominee. 

In a recent Gallop poll published 
Feb. I, people were surveyed as to 
whom they would vote into office in 
the next elections. Unexpectedly, 
results showed that Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush took 57 percent of the votes 
to Gore's 39 percent while Elizabeth 
Dole beat Gore 50 percent to 42 per-
cent. According to Reuters, Bush and 
Dole emerged as the Republican 
favorites by voters in the Los Angeles 
Times poll, although neither have 
declared themselves as candidates. 

This data has created a great amount 
of talk; political analysts are going crazy 
over what the results mean. Everyone 
wants to know if these two politicians 
will announce their candidacy. 

However, it would be more inter-
esting to see Elizabeth Dole and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton slugging it 
out over the presidency. It would be 
amazing to see Clinton and Dole argu-

. ing over health care in a presidential 
debate. Besides. it is about time we 
had a woman in the White House 
that's not a First Lady! 

Both Clinton and Dole are extreme-
ly qualified and have had long careers 
in the public sector. As a matter of 
comparison, both women share an 
awfully similar background. ~Iizabeth 
Dole and Hillary Clinton grew up in 
the Midwest in a nuclear family. Dole 
went to Duke University. Clinton to 
Wellesley. Both attended prominent 
law schools (Harvard and Yale. respec-
tively). Dole began as a Democrat 
while Clinton was first a Republican, 
and both women have become 
extremely influential in their careers. 

Dole is the only woman in history to 
hold two cabinet positions under differ-
ent administrations (Secretary of 
Transportation under Reagan and 
Secretary of Labor under Bush) and was 
the head of the American Red Cross 
before her recent retirement. Dole has 
been credited with the enforcement of 
two significant advances in auto safety 
- the air bag and a brake light nick-
named the "Dole light." 

Clinton is no slouch either. After 
her husband became president in 1993. 
Clinton was appointed to chair the 
Task Force on National Health Care 
Reform. She has written articles such 
as "It Takes a Village and Other 
Lessons Children Teach Us" concern-
ing societal responsibilities to chil-
dren. Clinton has also authored a syn-
dicated newspaper column, "Talking It 
Over," discussing her role as First 
Lady. On top of this, she has worked to 
reform the nation's foster care system 
and promote adoption.

JORDAN CLOSES A CHAPTER, OPENS ANOTHER 
COMMENTARY: 
Hussein's greatness 
leaves shoes too large 
for anyone to fill 
By 11Ieodore Dokko 
Senior Staff ~ter 

Sunday, Feb. 7 marked the 
death of a political giant in the 
Middle East. His Majesty, King 
Hussein ibn Talal al Hashem of 
Jordan passed away at the age of 63 
after a long battle with non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hussein's 
death marked the end of an unpar-
alleled, 47-year reign. 

Hussein inherited the throne at 
17 after the assassination of his 
grandfather. Abdullah I. What 
Hussein inherited in 1951 was little 
more than a British protectorate that 
had been carved out of the desert 
sand. Out of the arid land Hussein 
built a country that balanced its 
Arabic nationalism with its longing 
to become Westernized, all within 
the context of its political reality. 

The king's reign was plagued by 
turbulence during its early years. 
During that time. the Middle East 
region had experienced a rise in 
nationalism, to which Jordan was 
not immune. The spirit of national-
ism lead Hussein to usher Jordan 
into an era of greater independence 
from Great Britain. This movement 
toward self-reliance was not well 
received by the British and was 
seen as an act of ingratitude. 

With the spirit of nationalism 
quite high. Egypt decided it was in 
her best interest that Hussein be 

removed from power in Jordan . 
The King foiled the Egyptian-
backed coup by personally appeal-
ing to the troops. 

Hussein made his greatest and 
gravest miscalculation in 1967. 
Under pressure from the 
Palestinians in his country, the king 
decided, against the advice of his 
senior military leader. to join Egypt 
in an invasion of Israel. Israel quite 
easily and quickly defeated its Arab 
opponents in a matter of six days. 
That fateful decision cost Jordan 
the totality of its air force, the high-
ly contentious West Bank region 
and 15.000 soldiers. 

With this defeat. Hussein real-
ized that Israel was a nation that 
could not be erased from the map. 
Despite the huge differences 
between the Jews and the Arabs, 
they would have to learn to live 
together peacefully. After the Six 
Day War, Hussein drafted a UN 
Resolution that allowed Israel to 
peacefully exist if it agreed to 
return the lands that it had gained 
during the war. 

Pursuing the ever-fleeting peace 
in the Arabic and Jewish world 
became the king's mission. Long 
before any other country had signed 
peace accords with .Israel, lIussein 
had opened up secret negotiations 
with the Israeli government. The 
peace talks culminated in July r994 
with Hussein signing a peace agree-
ment - which ended hostilities 
between the two nations - with his 
enemy and nemesis Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 

Hussein traveled to Israel a year

and a half later to see the Prime 
Minister buried, after an Israeli 
opponent of peace gunned down 
his newly won friend. He delivered 
a moving eulogy that touched 
many hearts in which he recalled, 
"As long as I live. I'll be proud to 
have known him." 

Hussein's pursuit of peace did 
not end with the peaceful coexis-
tence of Israel and Jordan. Hussein 
was a major player in the search for 
peace between the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization (PLO) and 

Israel. 
Negotiation at the Wye 

Plantation in October of 1998 
between the PLO and Israel had 
bogged down. The hope of agree-
ing on anything was quickly disap-
pearing. Hussein, who was under-
going chemotherapy at the Mayo 
Clinic, decided to temporarily stop 
the treatment and arise from his 
sick bed to help with the negotia-
tions and make a personal plea for 
peace between the two nations. 

His presence at the negotiations 
changed the whole dynamic of the 
situation. Within days, a peace 
agreement was signed between the 
PLO and Israel. Hussein had single-
handedly created peace in the region 
he so deeply loved. 

Hussein's death was marked and 
observed by all the world. 

The American flag flew at half 
staff at the White House, an 
uncommon event for the death of a 
foreign dignitary. President Clinton 
lead a U.S. delegation that included 
the First Lady and three men who 
used to call the White House home: 
Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford. 
They all went to Amman to say 
goodbye to a personal friend. 

Close to a million Jordanians 
took to the streets of Amman to say 
a last farewell. Presidents. prime 
ministers and princes new from all 
parts of the globe to pay their last 
respects. Even the ailing Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin defied doc-
tor 's confinement orders and said 
goodbye. The impressive array of 
leaders included those who were 
his billerest enemies. 

The sheer diversity and number 
of dt"legations were testament to 
Hussein's stature in world affairs 
and his love for peace. 

As Jordan closed one chapter in 
her history, it opened a new one in 
which Hussein 's eldest ~on, 
Abdullah II. was crowned king. The 
37-year-old Abdullah promised to 
carryon his father's dream of 
peace. He told Jordanians that. 
"King Hw,sein was a father to every 
one of you, as he was my father. 
Today you are my brothers and si,-
ters, and you are dear to me." 

Like his father, Abdullah faces 
. challenges, primarily coming from 

his own family. His uncle Hassan 
was unceremoniously deposed from 
the line of succession by Hussein 
and the new king must pacify the ex-
crown prince and assure him that he 
will have a place in the monarchy. In 
addition, the Jordanian economy 
needs a boost and legislators are 
clamoring for a fix . 

Finally, on the world stage. 
Abdullah has some very big shocs 
to fill. He will undoubtedly be 
unable to command the respect that 
his late father did. His challenge is 
to continue his father 's legacy of 
having Jordan playing a viable role 
in peace in the Middle East. 

Though untested, Abdullah is 
thought to be a chip off the old 
block. If he docs follow In his 
father's footsteps, Jordan will rise 
again from the desert sand as a 
strong, peace-pursuing nation in the 
volatile region of the Middle East.

Casual dating. like it or not. cen-

ters almost completely on physical 
allractiveness. This is often a bum-
mer for those of us who aren't 
exactly model material. Besides, 
even· when two people manage to 
find each other significantly allrac-
tive, they're playing with fire in the 
personality depanment. Honestly, 
people. can you tell me that you 

friends. While I was "developing 
my relationship" with my 
boyfriend by spending every wak-
ing minute with him, I let all other 
relationships in my life slip into 
various states of disrepair. I spent 
three years of my life devoting 
most of my time to a relationship 
that amounted to absolutely noth-
ing. Don't we have beuer things to 
be doing with our time? Why 

neglect your life for something 
that may not last? 

I have found the source of 
America 's problems: dating. In 
favor of rational thought and 
hannony in this nation. I pro-
pose we ban all dating. everywhere. 

-OPINION-
COLUMN 

This brings me to my next 
point: Not Dating ... Anymore. 
Dating can ruin your life even 
after you stop dating. Case in 

In the eight or nine years that I 
have had significant interest in the 
opposite sex. I've seen my fair 
share of the pain and sulTering that 
"romantic" relationships can cause. 
Forthe sake of brevity. I'll limit my 
argument to dating at the college 
level. However. I trust that middle 
school and high school students 
across the country will follow suit 
once colleges recognize dating for 
the evil force that it is and institute 
campus wide bans. 

Dating •. while it seems like a 
rational. entertaining thing to do on 
a Friday night. causes nothing but 
massive disruption of otherwise 
happy lives. This can be seen in all 
three stages of dating: Casual 
Dating. Serious Dating and the ever 
popular Not Dating ... Anymore. 

Almost every individual that 
enters the "dating scene" will come 
face to face with each of these ugly 

take the time to get to know some-
one's great personality before ask-
ing them out? Of course not. that's 
what the date's for! 

You go on dates to separate the 
auractive idiots from the attractive 
people you actually want to spend 
more time with. Before you actual-
ly get to know each other, you have 
one thing in common: you find each 
other physically attracti ve. This is 
where long strings of one-night 
stands come in. Some people don't 
see any problem with that. But hey, 
don't share your diseases with me. 

Even more dangerous than 
sleeping arou"d is situation '2: 
Serious Dating, also known as the 
long-term relationship. This 
monbpolizes your time, your ener-

you know it.

point: I have a good friend who has 
not one, not two, but three different 
ex-boyfriends making her life com-
plicated at the moment. One owes 
her money, one is turning mutual 
friends away from her and the third 
manages to get her crying every 
time they talk. 

Relationships that have ended 
are almost worse than relationships 
that haven 't. Even if two people 
break up on "good terms," there 
will always be an element of weird-
ness, since they were once more 
than friends. Old relationships can 
haunt you until your last dying 
breath. The only way to avoid the 
societal disruption that "old 
flames" cause is to ban dating alto-
gether. 

I'm not proposing we throw 
marriage out the window along 
with dating. although proponents of 
population control might like that.

MIGRATE TO COMMUNISM Depression Editor: There are eloquent ways of 
making points and countering 
opposition. Simone Santini's piece 
"Liberal Disappearing Act" (Feb. 
8) was both tasteless and absurd. 

He has no respect for others or 
integrity of any kind. Just because 
he supports a communitarian agen-
da is no reason to personally auack 
others like by naming Elizabeth 
Dole a member of ·'the unholy tnn-
ity." 

Moreover, his article illustrated 
his own ignorance on how to pre-
sent a clear and concise argument. 
Go back to grade school. and grow 
up! 

If he wants to play the numbers 
game, the fact of the maller is. our 
poor are still the richest in the 
world, and the spread of the multi-
national corporation was a direct 
result of his Keynesian philosophy. 

The government that he so loves

petition. It also made a "fat" public.

Hillary Clinton is not the only

Bob Dole, of all people, has also

He can't because we still have it 
the best. Why doesn't he. along 
with the millions of others who feel 

ever really lefi. Dole incorporates 
her faith into each of her speeches. 
She tells the story of Esther as a 
prelude to her "sermons:' 

It is truly remarkable how sim-
ilar these two women are. The 
only difference is that Clinton has 
Chelsea and Dole has none. But 
what is even more outstanding is 
that these two women have the 
one-two to contend with any other 
politician. They have the experi-
ence. the drive and the charisma. 

I do not think the American 
male population is quite ready to 
give up the reigns of power and let 
a woman do the job. This senti-
ment is evident in the abundant 
anti-Hillary propaganda. Such 
expressions as ''Get the wicked 
witch out of the White House," 
"Impeach the President and her 
husband, too" and "Hillary wears 
the pants; Bill does the dance" are 
indicalions that a woman in power 
is still a scary thing for SOr:1C pe0-
ple. Maybe they are just afraid of 
having a First Gentleman!

DATING: 
Work on making 
really great friends 
C ........ d "- .... _ • 
Rather. I'd Ii ke to suggc~t an alter-
nate system of finding lifelong pan-
ners. Dating has ocen preuy ineffi-
cient in this area. Not only do most 
of us go through several serious 
relationships before seuling down, 
but the majority of those marriages 
end in divorce. Obviously, we're 
doing something wrong. 

Here is the plan: Work on friend· 
ships. If we all have a buncll of real-
ly great friends. it should be no 
problem to pick one of them to 
marry once we've had a few great 
years of unobstructed singleness. 
So quit dating, all of you. And if 
you cboose to leave my advice 
unheeded and want to date anyway, 
don't come knocking at my door.

In addition to providing exten-
sive tutoring services, the academ-
ic enrichment di vision has also 
established several educational 
endeavors to promote post-sec-
ondary academics. 

One such program is The 
SalUrday Academy. which is in its 
rirsl year. Currently active at 
Gompers Secondary School, the 
program helps seventh- and eighth-
grade siudenis who - by maintain-
ing a GPA or 3.0 or above -
demonstrate excellence in acade-
mics and display college potential. 

While in the program, Mudents 
arc provided with inrormation on 
college admission requirement, 
siandardized college entrance 
exams and financial aid. 

Michael Temple is the program 
director of the Saturday Academy. 
A graduate sludent at San Diego 
State University, he said that he 
believes introducing the topic of 
college to kids in their junior high 
school years wi II encourage them 
to continue their academic achieve-
ments toward a college education. 

"lWe! get their mind frame 
thinking toward the UC system 
especially, and the requirements and 
the standards that they hold, so that 
they will have something to work 
ror [and! so that they will maintain 
their academic success to be a pan 
of the system," Temple said. 

Maintenance of high mathemat-
ics and literacy skills are also 

emphasized in this program. In 
addition to working with the stu-
dents, the Saturday Academy by 
asks parents to allend workshops 
addressing topics such as how to 
schedule meetings with a child's 
counselor and how to suppon a 
child's studies at home. 

"Education is a family project 
It's a community project," Doughty 
said. 

The academic enrichment divi-
sion also offers another 'program 
that introduces college to students 
at an even earlier level. ''I'm Going 
to College" is a projcctthat focuses 
on presenting founh-grade students 
with the racets of college life. 

Students not only go on field 
trips to various San Diego colleges 
and universities - such as UCSD 
- but they are also presented with 
hypothetical ~cenarios about col-
lege Ii fe, ~uch as figuring out ways 
10 rinance schooling. 

Program coordinators said that 
they hope to encourage students to 
think seriously abollt college and 
highcr education through these sce-
narios. 

The second division or Cal-
SOAP is advisement, which is 
coordinated by Pam Perry. 
Perryshares the responsibi lities of 
the advisement division with col-
lege peer advisors. 

. "We're helping students that 
don't have parents or siblings that 
maybe are going on to college." 
Perry said. "And they don't have 
anyone as a role model to help 
them or guide them through the 
process. Sometimes it can really be 
overwhclming. " 

College peer advisors work both 
one-On-one and through workshops

with the high school students. The 
advisors provide the students with 
information ~garding financial aid 
and the college application process, 
as well as advice from their own 
college experiences. 

Over 200 college peer advisors 
and tutors work for Cal-SOAP. 
Many of the college peer advisors 
are undergraduates who are aiming 
at a career in teaching, counseling 
or social work. 

"[t's basically the best hands-on 
experience that [college students] 
can get [by] working with the stu-
dents" said UCSD senior Cristina 
Aguirre, who assists in the advise-
ment division of the program. 

UCSD students comprise a 
large number of the college stu-
dents involved in Cal-SOAP. San 
Diego's division or Cal-SOAP 
includes UCSD, Grossmont 
College, San Diego State 
University, San Diego City 
College, University or San Diego, 
Sweetwater Union High School 
District, Vista Unified School 
District and San Diego Unified 
School District. 

Doughty said that she praises the 
organizations and administnllion or 
UCSD for being pro-active in its 
eOons to see students rrom all back-
grounds and levels allend college. 

"[UCSD] is trying to change 
dynamics. They're working more 
with schools. They have more stu-
dents that are volunteering to go 
into the community. And I think 
IUCSD] is staning to recognize 
that it's not only gelling !students] 
through the door, even at IUCSD], 
but also about retention."

- Female. age 26/rom The Guide to Gelling it On 

Picture it now: The lights are dim, a fire is burning in the 
fireplace and a steamy bath awaits you in the bathroom. It's the 
evening of Valentine's Day and the two of you are all alone. 

The time has come and you reach for the special gift that you have 
purchased for your loved one. Opening the p~sent produces a look 
of pleasure, shock and intrigue; exposure to The Guide to Gelling il 
On often has this effect. 

Recall the day before, when you were anxiously scouring the 
malls for the perfect gift. Perfume or cologne? Too predictable. 
Chocolate? Too fallening. Silk pajama pants? Too obvious. Hand-
cuffs? Too kinky. What to do? 

Out of desperation, you enter the bookstore, sure that this is not 
the place where you will find what you're looking for. At least it pro-
vides a welcome break from the commercialized, Hallmark version 
of love that the mall offers. 

Suddenly, out of nowhere, you see it. You had not known what 
you were looking for, but there it was. Filled with humorous anec-
dotes, helpful hints, erotic imagery and c~ative suggestions, it isn't 
for the faint of heart. One of the largest, most detailed, politically cor-
reet and informative sex manuals to date. This book was, hands 
down, the perfect Valentine's gift. Without shame you went to the 
counter and purchased the guide, anxious to get home to read it. 

Most everyone on this campus could afford 10 know a little bit 
more about sex. That is why this book is recommended; whether')'ou 
are single or betrothed, wild or inhibited, straight or homosexual, 
kinky or conventional, this book will have something for you. 

The guide begins with an in-depth discussion of gender issues, 
sexual orientation and roles of intimacy in sex in a non-judgmental, 
yet educational, way, The author, Paul Joannides, who publishes with 
Goofy Foot Press, is male, and yet the book wonderfully avoids a See"" Page 11

LOVE WITHOUT CONDITIONS 
13ig Love' ties turbulent emotions and dance together on stage at UCSD 

IF()iCan 
T~9IJma[)9IJK 

By Brenna Hampton 
Staff Writer 

Ah, love. Depending on who you 
ask, love is the most wonderful 
experience on this Earth. or the bane 
of humankind. Charles L. Mee's 
play "Big Love, or the Wedding of 
the Millennium." renders an account 
of a few possible perceptions about 
love and the opposite sex. 

Ask Mee about love. and he 
would most likely quote from his 
play. ''True love has no conditions. 
That's why it's so awful to fall in 
love." Realist, maybe, but he has a 
very honest approach to this very 
tender subject. 

An adaptation of Aeschylus' ''The 
Suppliants," "Big Love" tells the 
story of 50 young Greek sisters, who 
were betrothed before birth by their 
parents to their 50 American cousins. 
They are unwilling participants, 
bound by an agreement that they had 
no say in. As the sisters attempt to 
reason with each other. with their 
protectors and with their pursuers, 
you get an unabashed glimpse of 
how Mee views the world. 

The play begins with three, of 
the 50. sisters who have ned their 
homeland by yacht to the terrace of 
Piero. a wealthy Italian business 
man. They are trying to escape 
from their cousins. who are pursu-
ing them to force them to fulfill 
their parent's agreement. 

The first sister is Demetra, who 
is excellently portrayed by Quincy 
Bemstine. She is a spiteful. intelli-
gent woman on an anti-marriage 
crusade. Portrayed as a strong-
willed. fierce woman, she 
strongly resents not hav-
ing a choice in 
her mate. 

Olympia, played by Melody 
Butiu, is a passive. comedic char-
acter who, realistically, cannot 
seem to make up her mind. She 
loves men, but does not have 
the strength of heart to defy 
Demetra's willful 
arguments against I ~ 
marriage. 

Lydia (Mary 
Garrison) is 
a voice of t ( 
reason 
among the sisters. 
She. too, agrees with Demetra's 
logic regarding how unfair it is that 
they are denied a choice regarding 
their life partners. She, however, 
rationalizes her choices, and tries 
too hard to explain love and its place 
within the human composition. 

As for the men, they represent a 
variety of stereotypical males. Con-
stantine. played by David Kupchin-
sky. is Demetra's opposite. He pas-
sionately raves about his traditional 
ideals regarding marriage and the 
necessity of female subjuga,tion. 

Nikos, played by Sam Wright, is 
a wonderfully romantic man unable 
to resist his admiration" for Lydia. 
He approaches her from a position 
of respect and admiration. He woos 
her with words, rather then attempt-
ing to seize her by foree. This radi-
cally different approach attempts to 
demonstrate how sweet love can be. 

The third cousin, played by 
Ricardo Chavira, is Olympia's sex-
ually focused mate. He is the per-
fect representation of the average 

college man: 
reasonable. but 

won't tum down the 
opposite sex if given the 

opportunity. In other 
words, happily ambiva-

lent about life and affairs of 
love. 

Among the other actors, John-
Andrew Morrison shines as Guil-
iano, the somewhat ambiguously 
(eminine host of the forlorn sisters. 
Guiliano is Piero's nephew, who 
stays with him. Lori Yeghiayan 
plays Bella. the grandmother of 
Guiliano and mother of Piero who 
sympathizes with all parties. She 
plays the judge and jury of the three 
sisters, their cousins, her family and 
ultimately of love itself. 

Mee attacks love, sex, gender 
relations, stereotypes and other mat-
ters of political importance in "Big 
Love." The script provides plenty of 
comic relief, if not precise answers 
to love's questions. Intense direction 
by Les Waters and amazing modem 
dance choreography by Jean Isaacs 
allow for a lot of crashing and romp-
ing around the stage - physically 
expressing the anguish inherent in 
any love story. The play's speech 
and movement combine io create 
the overall feeling of chaos and 
purity tinged with a dark, introspec-

tive statement about humanity. In 
the end, we find that love

GUIDE: 
Guide offers a 
healthy view of sex 
. . 

Cull II ... ".. ...... 
male-centered viewpoint. The 
entire first chapter is dedicated to 
healing the sexual-power imbal-
ance between men and women. 
suggesting that both sexes can 
equally benefit from "getting it 
on." 

So, you may ask, what exactly 
is entailed in 'getting it on'? From 
the look of it. a wide spectrum of 
possibilities exist that may have 
never entered your Aunt Thelma's 
mind. And don't worry, Joannides 
gives plenty of time to the creative 
possibilities that exist. The guide is 
668 pages of never-boring text. 
including illustrations of genital 

chuacteristics, examples of differ-
ent types of kinky play toys and 
personal testimonies of pleasure. 

The guide is like The Joy of Sex, 
answering questions that even the 
most experienced person might 
have. What does an orgasm feel 
like? What exactly is "doggy 
style"? How healthy is masturba· 
tion'! The answers are detailed. 
both textually and visually, with 
Daerick Gross as the honest illus-
trator. The realistic, yet cartoon-
like figures. spare no details when 
depicting these typically taboo top-
ics. 

The humor is one of the best 
aspects of this super-informative 
sex·source. Nothing is taken too 
seriously. Section titles include, 
"When Your Minister and His Wife 
Have Anal Sex," "Weenie 
Enhancement Techniques" and

"Zucchini Revenge." 
The most surprising part of the 

book is that despite the fact that it 
attacks its subject with humor. it 
does have some .serious messages. 
The author talks about important 
subjects like long·term relation-

ships. sex after a fight, sex after hav-
ing a baby and divorce and children. 

The role that religion plays in 
sex is addressed in a chapter aptly 
titled "Sex and Sects." In it, Joan-
nides addresses masturbatio!). pre-
marital sex and homosexuality. 

Joannides includes anecdotes to 
enhance his various points regard-
ing sexuality. For example. he 
offers up an interesting anecdote 
about Kellogg's Com Flakes: 

"Kellogg's Com Flakes were 
created to give children more sta-
mina so they wouldn't want to do 
horrible things like masturbate," 
Joannides stated. "John Harvey 
Kellogg MD, founder of the Oake, 
thought masturbation to be so evil 
that he encouraged parents to lift 
their sleeping children's nightshirts 
to make sure that no lillie fingers 
strayed into private places. To keep 

FEATURES II 

Dr. Kellogg spinning in his grave. 
this book encourages its readers to 
occasionally masturbate while eat-
ing a bowl of Kellogg's Corn 
Flakes." 

As George Michael once said. 
"Sex is natural. sex is good. Not 
everybody does it. but everybody 
should." This is the healthy 
stance that Tire Guide to GettinK 
it 011 takes toward one of today's 
most problematic issues. If you 
don't buy this book for your 
Valentine, then buy it for your-
self. Have fun!

14 FEATURES The UCSD Guardian Thunda~Febnuuy 11, 1999 

IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON VALEMlNE'S DAY 
One ex-smoker's decision to make the most of her life after facing a personal disaster 
By KJ.Mln sune 
Staff Writer 

I loved to smoke. It was the pas-
sion of my life. I enjoyed every-
thing about smoking; the taste, 
smell, sensations and its incredible 
ability to bring two strangers 
together. 

My daily schedule was contin-
gent on smoking and I would 
always make sure I had enough 
cigarelles In my pack. At the 
moment I woke up, the drive to 
school , before class, meals, meet-
ings and any other occasion I could 
qualify, there was always a perfect 
opportunity for a smoke. 

Ever since I had my first Marl-
boro Lights at the beginning of my 
freshman year in the Marshall 
dorms. I knew I had fallen in love. 
I didn 't care about the physical and 
psychological harm I was doing to 
myse lf. The rush of nicotine felt 
too good for me to consider the 
damage I was doing. I did not care 
about the fact that I had used it a~a 
crutch for my loneliness -'- who 
needs to be social when you can 
brood in pensive thought, alone 
with your cigarette. 

I had to leave during lectures, 
midterms and even finals to have a 
smoke and restimulate my concen-
tration - and this action was per-
formed long before studies were 
released about it. I used smoking as 
an excuse for not exercising. I 
became dependent and dangerously 
addicted with my pack-a-day habit. 
Sadly enough, for those four years. 

I did not care one bit. 
The reason why I quit smoking 

was not because of my health. It 
was not the advertisements, 
friends ' concerns' or surgeon gener-
als ' warnings that affected my deci-
sion. Smokers become callous to 
all of that with time. What turned 
my life around was seeing the light. 

Now it wasn't "THE" light I had 
seen, but the lights in the hospital 
emergency room on Valentine's 
Day in 1998. 

The day began beautifully on 
the slopes of Utah. Fresh snow fell 
on our heads as someone. who I 
once considered a friend, and I 
conqul red the powder with our 
snowboards. Yet the drive back 
from nature's wonderland would 
only stop me from having the abil-
ity to enjoy life like that again. 

Upon leaving the site. I asked 
my friend if he was all right to 
drive his car back home. Twice. he 
assured me of his competence. So 
in fatigue. I dozed off, not knowing 
that was the last time life would 
ever be normal for me. 

When I regained consciousness, 
I knew something had gone terribly 
wrong. Wht~n I felt the limpness in 
my arm and the glass in my eye, I 
knew this was no minor collision. I 
remember screaming, "What's hap-
pening?" because I could not see 
for myself. It was also an outlet for 
the overwhelming anxiety and 
helplessness I felt at that moment. I 
was 700 miles away from anyone I 
knew. There I was in the wreckage. 

helpless and unable to see. 
The four days I spent in the hos-

pital were some of the worst I have 
ever experienced in my life. The 
worst aspect of the entire situation 
was that I had been deprived of what 
I always had the capacity to use 
without any restrictions: control. 

I now had no control at all. I had 
a neck brace on so I could not move. 
freely. Tubes and wires also 
restricted my movement to within 
the hospital bed. There were tubes 
in my nose and my throat, as well 
as my urethra. IVs drained into the 
holes that were punctured into the 
veins of my hands and arm. I had 
EKG monitors taped all over my 
chest and back. I was kept from 
eating or drinking because I had to 

ha~ surgery the next morning. I 
could not sit up without adjustipg 
the wet collon over the cut pieces 
of my face that were to be stitched 
together the next morning. 

I became extremely nauseated 
and irritable from the morphine that 
was constantly injected into my 
bloodstream. My throat was 
extremdy dry because my nose was 
congested frem crying all night. 
Despite such discomfort, there was 
not a thing I could do about it. 

During that time, the conse-
quences of my careless habit 
became clear. As I was lying there 
helpless in the emergency room, I 
realized that if I continued to smoke, 
I would only end up in this situation 
again. If I continued to smoke, I 
would once again lie helpless in a 

hospital bed in agony and pain, stir-
ring in frustration and anx.iety over 
how I could have let this happen. If 
I kept smoking, I would go through 
this exhaustive, painful process of 
trying to heal. Only with smoking, 
recovery may not be an option. I 
would only be closer to becoming 
another statistic of the American 
Lung Cancer Association. 

I knew that I would be that help-
less again if I didn't quit smoking. 
I wasn't going to give myself the 
lUXUry of having a last cigarette. I 
disposed of my remaining packs of 
cigarettes and parted with my pre-
cious chrome matte finish Zippo 
proudly engraved with my initials. 

I stopped cold turkey. From that 
day on, I vowed never to smoke 
again. 

Keeping that promise has not 
been easy. I remember at first I had 
all this free time that I used to spend 
smoking. I mean, what am I sup-
posed to do after a meal or when I 
have coffee outdoors? What other 
way do I know of to relieve stress 
over finals week or celebrate its end? 

Maybe it was recovering from 
the accident that took my mind 
away from smoking during the ini-
tial stages. I can also attribute the 
generous support I had from my 
roommates from that year and the 
close friends I had made over the 
years. But there are still times when 
I go out to a club or a cafe or even 
get together with friends who 
smoke that trigger the old cravings 
again. I always wonder how one lit-

tie drag off a cigarette would feel as 
I would close my eyes and take a 
deep breath. 

Every time temptation arises. I 
must remind myself of exactly why 
I quit. After that, I do not need 
much more convincing. 

In addition to those experiences in 
the hospital and recovery thereafter, I 
also take into consideration reasons 
of the future. Within the next 15 
years, childbearing time will arise. I 
could not live with the thought of 
hanning my potential children. 

For four years, I wasn't just 
smoking away at cigarettes. With 
each drag, I was reducing a 
moment of life I could have other-
wise enjoyed. 1lte auto accide.nt 
was an extreme and difficult way 
for me to tum my life around. 
Though it did break my bones, my 
skin and much of the self-confi-
dence I once had, I am still grateful 
that I lived so I could have the 
chance to quit smoking and salvage 
what I do have left of my life -
and I have great plans in store. 

I know I was extremely fortu-
nate to have survived the accident. 
Amanda Borad, who was a fresh-
man at Thurgood Marshall College 
last year, died in a hit-and-run auto 
accident on that same Valentine's 
Day. Through the tears I wept for 
her, I knew that I was very fortu-
nate to have lived. 

I now have the chance to make 
the most of my life. That opportu-
nity was extended the day I quit 
smoking.

A TOAST TO TASTY LOVE 
Top 0' the Cove offers a special menu for hungry lovers 
By Unduy IworskI 
Guardian Hiatus Editor 

Even the most starving student 
can afford to splurg on a good meal 
now and then. Two-pound Maine 
Lobster Thermidor seared with tar-
ragon and mushrooms and finished 
with a brandy cre'Am, perhaps? This 
dish is the highlight of this year's 
Valentine's Day menu at Top 0' the 
Cove restaurant. 

Nestled into its portion of 
Prospect Street and overlooking the 
peaceful waters of La Jolla's 
famous cove, this restaurant is the 

~ place to stage the ideal and 
decadent romantic dinner. San 
Diego's Business Journal called it 
"romance central" and nothing is 
being spared for those willing to 
spend over $20 for an entree. The 
experience is worth every penny. 

For example, after finishing the 
gourmet teriaki frog legs - which 
can be found on the normal menu. 
though unfortunately will not be 
included for Valentine's Day - a 
good-tempered and dignified wait-
er brings a delicate scoop of peach 
sorbet to help cleanse the diners' 
pallets for the next course. After 
finishing the deliCIOUS, beautifully 
decorated entrees and dessens. 
patrons are given complimentary 

" I I) \ , 

chocolate caramel chilled trumes 
that could inspire sensual passions. 
Chocolate, of course has long be 
rumored to be an aphrodisiac, 
which will do nothing but benefit 
love-birds on Valentine's day. 

An outdoor shed - that was 
once the maids' quarters when the 
home-turned-restaurant was built 
in the late 19th century - is now 
horne to the 70th best wine collec-
lion in the world. Some of these 
bottles are well over a $ 1,000 and 
bids on top bottles have been made 
in the past by some of our more 
affluent La Jollan neigbbors. The 
collection does include a wide vari-
ety of red, white and bubbly selec-
tions, however. that will easily sat-
isfy those a bit lower in the income 
tax brackets. 

For radio listeners feeling espe-
cially lucky, KCBQ-1170AM will 
give away a Valentine's Dinner for 
two to one lucky caller. If you're 
not so lucky, perhaps you and your 
date could split the price and do this 
Valentine's dinner dutch. At least 
the men won't need to wony about 
roses as each lady will be presented 
upon entering the restaurant with a 
loveiy flower to mark the occasion. 
And of course her chair will be 
pulled oul for her, and her napkin 

placed respectfully on her lap. 
If Chef Sockrider 's Valentine's 

menu is anywhere near as delec-
lable as his daily creations, then the 
meal is sure to be a culinary suc-
cess. Once a year everyone 
deserves a little Oscietre caviar, 
escargots de bourgogne or poached 
Norwegian salmon with H. Fessy 
nouveau beaujolais beurre rouge. 
(The duck is a lillie dry, however.) 
Vegetables not common in the 
average college student's diet are 

. placed artfully on the plate, and 
each and C"Iery one of the rich 
dessens will leave your IYIOUth 
watering. 

Thoug~ Top o'the Cove is near-
ly booked for Feb. 14, there is addi-
tional seating for the whole holiday 
weekend al 6, 8 and 10 p.m. in the 
dining room and 5, 7 and 9 p.m. in 
the upstairs cafe. Also, the outdoor, 
fully heat-Iamped seating is nol yet 
booked due to the possibility of 
rain. This, as an inside tip, is the 
best seating in the house just wait-
ing for you and you loved one. 

So if this Valentine's Day is 
sunny and you're without any 
reservations, gi ve Top o' the Cove a 
call at 454-7779. Enjoy your meal, 
don't forget the tip. and good luck 
gelling lucky.

NO BOMB THIS VALENTINE'S WEEKEND 
Brendan Fraser and David Foley unearth a gem with 'Blast from the Past' IJ.....,.., 
St.' Wl'iter 

Ignore the poster. Ignore the 
commercials. Ignore the fact that 
"Blast from the Past" is being 
released right before Valentine's 
Day. It may be touted as a romance, 
but for all the guys out there who 
have been rolling their eyes, here's 
some good news - director Hugh 
Wilson's new movie is a witty, intel-
ligently written comedy that only 
dabbles in romance and never lor-
gets that its tongue is planted firmly 
in its cheek, 

The plol is absurd: In 1962. a 
brilliant yet slightly insane inventor 
Calvin Webber (played with aplomb 
by the supelb Christopher Walken) 
is so afraid that the Cuban Missile 
Crisis will result in the total annihi-
lation of the U.S. that he locks him-
self and his wife Helen (played by 
the equally game Sissy Spacek) in a 
bomb shelter resembling their 
house. As luck would have it, a 
plane crashes directly above them 
and the explosion convinces Calvin 
that there was a nuclear blast- rea-
son enough for him and Helen to 
stay down there long enough to sur-
vive any radiation poisoning (35 
years, to be eXIet). 

During that time they have a son 
named Adam who grows up to be 
Brendan Fraser - a clone of a 
young Tom Hanks if there ever was 
one. The character development 
really lakes off inside the bomb 
sheher. with the neurotic Calvin 

waking up every day to a paradise of 
his own creation - a world consist-
ing of the same meals, the same 
decor and the same Honeymooners 
episode on television. 

At the same time, it is Spacek's 
character Helen whose mind slowly 
unravels with each passing hour. 
She tums to binge drinking as a way 
to cope. She's brilliant as she comes 
undone, plotting her escape past her 
unsuspecting husband so that she 
can sce the sky again - or buy 
more alcohol. 

Adam decides to go up to the 
surface 10 meet a girl, and it'~ here 
that he gets to play up the "fish out 
of water" comedy with all the goofi-
ness of a child on his first trip to 
Disneyland. He immediately meets 
and falls for the self-acclaimed psy-
chic Eve (a bad pun, played by an 
equally bad Alicia Silverstone -
the only weak link in the whole 
film). 

Eve can't stand him, though, so 
Adam hires her as his pimp to lind 
him a woman, paying her off in old 
baseball cards. But the movie wise-
ly chooses to playoff the romance 
between the two, and instead 
becomes a matchmaking comic 
romp through Los Angeles as Eve 
tries to find him the perfect woman 
while working on her "\ want to be 
Drew Banymore" pout. 

Just when it looks like Silver-
stone is about to ruin all the fun, it is 
Dave Foley as Eve's gay roommate 
Troy who comes along and steals 

every scene he is in. Adam and Troy 
instantly click (sample dialogue: 
"He's gay." "Well, good for him!"), 
as Troy teaches him how to dress 
and' Adam retums the favor by 
teaching him manners. 

There cannot be enough said 
about the supponing cast, who not 
only act as if they know how silly 
the whole concept is, but also act 
like it all could have really hap-
pened. Every character is distinct, 
even when they're only on the 
screen for a minute or two. One of 
the best characters is the 60s soda 
jerk-turned 70s biker-turned 
washed-out bum whose life unfolds 
directly above the bomb shelter. 
When Calvin breaks through the 
noor in his space suit, the man 
transforms into a religious nut 
whose life revolves around 
Calvin's warning, "Leave my ele-
vator alone!" Soon a whole cult is 
camped out around the elevator, 

' chanting the line like a gospel 
hymn. 

"Blast from the Past" uses sman 
dialogue, a wonderful cast (sans 
Silverstone), and a show-stopping 
swing danl:c with two beautiful 
blondes to keep a recycled theme 
fresh and exciting. But it's the little 
things - a social worker's childish 
tantrum, Walken's triumphant 
march across his lawn - that give 
this movie more than enough per-
sonality. It's a silly plot, sure, but 
you'll catch yourself wanting to 
believe just the same.

A FRIENDLY DEBAlE OF A 'HALLMARK' HOLUDAY 
Guardian editors wax satin'c about Valentine's Day, anniversaries and gender stereotypes in tbis sarcastic dialogue 
By Tabitha and W8lt 
Senior Staff Couple 

Tabitha: What are we going 10 
do for Valentine's Day.? 

Walt: I already told you: I' m not 
telling you. It 's a surprise. But I 
know you don 't like big shenani-
gans so I'm keeping it simple. 

1'1/1 glad 10 hear it; the whole 
Valentine 's Day has lurned into a 
Hallmark holiday (incidentally, I'm 
impressed you can spell sheneni-
gans). 

I'm disappointed that you can'\. 
[Walt is smacked for being a wise 
ass.] Anyway, it may be over com-
mercialized. but that doesn't mean 
it isn 't worth celebrating. Besides, 
you like getting dressed up don 't 
you? 

ThaI 's notfair. 
What 's not fair? 
Unlike YOLl, I don 't think thaI 

what 1'111 wearing justifies an entire 
holiday ... SerioLlsly. I like the idea 
of Valellline's Da.\; hilt I dislike the 
form it tends 10 take. I think the 
ideal would be fo r people to just tell 
whoever they cure abolll that they 
care abolll Ihe,,/. Ilhillk that a lot of 
Ihe tillle peOI]le get so caLlght LIp ill 
Irying to imp res.\' who they're with 
that ther dOll 't enjoy themselves. 

Three things: I. Based on what 
I' 01 wearing now. what would the 

holiday be'! 2. As I stated the last 
time we discussed this. men aren't 
going to call up their buddies and 
start telling them how much they 
care about them. 3. [Long pause] 
Okay, just two things. 

Based on what you're wearing 
now, il would be some sort of holi-
day celebrating the importance of 
Cheerios to the TlDtioool economy. 
/ Walt is wearing a Cheerios T-shirt, 
not Cheerios stuck to his body.) As 
10 the second queslion, Why not? 
You never gave a very clear reply. 

All I'm saying is that guys don't 
want to get phone calls from their 
friends telling them how important 
they are and how much they appre-
ciate their friendship. It just takes a 
different form with guys. [Walt 
knows he is leaving himself open 
for snide remarks here.) 

So what is the ideal Valentine's 
Day to you ? 

Ideal.. . I'd have to say that cards 
to your family and spe'1ding the 
day (or some part thereof) with 
someone close to you is preuy 
much ideal to me. 

"Sollleone c/ose to you IS 
ambiguous, .\'0 maybe YllU should 
cal/llp some of those guy friends of 
YOllrs if I can 'I spend the whole day 
with you. /Walt glares./llhink we

Was I? I disagreed with your sug-
gestion about merging Valentine's 
Day with our six-month anniversary. 
You know. it's pretty hard to type 
like this... [Tabitha is sitting on 
Walt·s lap and kissing his neck. I 

You're right, it 's much beller 
this way where we totally ignore 
the anniversary. Seriollsly, I sug-

lVith eaclt other at some random

also be the ideal lVay to celebrate 
Valentine s Day? 

Stop trying to cloud the issue 

with your crazy rescheduling and 
converging of events! Our forefa-
thers didn't establish Valentine's 
Day to be on the 14th for no reason 
you know! 

If you have nothing to say, why 
don 'I you jusl admit it? That's the 
problem with men, they 're so illog-
ical. {Tabitha, as usual, can'r resist 
reversing gender stereotypes.) 

Yes, I suppose there is no logi-
cal defense to such a ludicrous sug-
gestion. [Tabitha doesn't like this 
response. Walt suggests she write 
his responses from now on.] 

What suggestion, uactly, was 
ludicrous? The bit where I suggest-
ed ),ou write logically? 

Aside froin spending the major-
ity of the day on the phone with 
your millions of loved ones. how 
would you most like to spend our 
brief moments this Sunday? 

I don ', know; I haven 't thought 
too much about it. With you is good 
all by itself 

Nice try smoothie' 1 guess we 
might as well call this our Valen-
tines Day 1 mean. I picked you up. 
we put some gas in my car. we had 
a lovely meal at In 'N' Out, and 
we' re typing this ridiculous article 
which, as you put it, no one will 
appreciate but us and the people 
who know us. 

ActUQlly, this is good. I think 
that what is done routinely is often 
more important than what you do 
on speciDl occasions. My favorite 
memories from when I was a kid 
are when we went hiking; my 
favorite memories from high school 
are going oul to coffee with friends. 
I think thai the day-to-day is more 
importtlntthan special events. 

But the day-to-day becomes a 
blur when life moves too fast which 
is why people have to have special 
days to make something stand out 
that they can remember and take 
Polaroids of for the scrapbook. 

[Tabitha thinks how sad this is, 
Walt thinks how all the "Ws" in 
this font look darker than the other 
characters. ] 

With the exception of the "w" 
bit, you have a good point. I don't 
like the idea that people have to 
make time with each other. DoeSIl 't 
mean you're not right. 

Well there you have it. UCSD. 1 
got her to admit that it doesn ' t 
mean I'm not right. 

You know I didn " mean it like 
that ... 

Yes, sorry. [Walt puts on his 
sheepish look.] Well anyway, I'm 
looking forward to spending both 
Valentine's Day and our anniver-
sary with you.

LAST CHANCE FOR 'LAD'( 
'My Fair Lady' offers a classic way to spend Valentine s Day 

ByMM:Conw 
Senior Staff Writer 

Many of us despise Valentine's 
Day, and rightfully so. For too long, 
we've been subjected to disappoint-
ment, expecting something special. 
something romantic. something fun. 
yet ending up with something 
cheap. insignificant and boring. This 
year. do something different and 
high-class: Attend a showing of the 
play "My Fair Lady" at the Lamb's 
Players Theatre in Coronado. 

This classic play, by Alan Jay 
Lerner and Frederick Loewe. is a 
unique adaptation to George 
Bernard Shaw's story "Pygmalion" 
of an anogant language professor 
who boasts that he can pass off a 
poor Cockney girl, who has little or 
no couth. as a royal heiress at the 
embassy ball. 

Opening in 1956, "My Fair 
Lady" has long been perfonned by 
theaters around the country. Some 
may also be familiar with the play in 
its movie form. starring Audrey 
Hepburn. However. nothing is like 
the live show. Lamb's Players The-
atre does an excellent job of exalting 
this classic and giving it a new light. 

Roben Smyth. one of Lamb's 
Players Theatre staff, plays the 
character of professor Henry Hig-
gins. Everyone has a picture in 
their mind of how a renowned, 
worldly professor should look and 
act. and Smyth becomes that man. 
His performance commandingly 
leads the show, as it shoUld. 

Lerner wrote in 1963, "We [lern-
er and Loewe] decided he should not 
be a singer; he should be an actor 
who sort of spoke some songs." 
Smyth executes this theory precisely 
with a form of poetic speech. 

The poor. street girl turned fair 
lady. Eliza Doolittle. is played by 
Deborah Gilmour Smyth. Though the 
character calls for someone younger, 
Smyth does a fair job with the char-
acter. What is most impressive about 
Smyth is her singing talent. Her 
voice. which is nearly too powerful 
for the small theater, is entrancing. 

The supporting actors did very 
well in framing the performances of 
Smyth and Smyth. One of the actors 
who stood apan from the crowd 
was Mike Buckley playing the pan

The UCSD cycling team sped 

past its competition this weekend 
in its first two nlCeS of the season. 

Road Race was held on 
Saturday, Feb, 6 at Boulevard, 
about one hour east of San Diego. 
The race was a grueling 70 miles, 
including a three mile climb, 
which team members say "makes 
Torrey Pines look like a speed 
bump." 

Jenny Eyerman placed second 
in the women's 'A' race and the 
women did their part, ' puuing 
UCSD in first place overall. 

In the men's 'N race, Rodrick 
Bates placed sixth and teammate 
Lee Lefkowitz finished 11th, 
scoring vital points for the team. 

Overall, the team broke away 
with first place, beating out usual 
conference powerhouses. 

After Saturday's competition. 
however, the team was not done 
for the weekend. On Sunday, Feb. 
7, it cycled in the Criterium Race. 

Jason Johnson and Dirk Van 
Ulden edged out the rest of the 
pack in the men's 'D' race to grab 
first and second places. 

Eyerman finished first in the 
women's 'A' race, beating easily 
the competition. Overall, UCSD 
placed second. 

Team vice president J4JOn 
Johnson helieved that UCSD per-
formed impressively this week-

-. . 

end, sbowins its 1tJ'CDSdt. 
"'Dus kind of raciot is what 

shoWl the collegiate ~ 
and the rest of the cycling com-
munity that UCSt> CIP brina the 
heat," Johnson said. "It was 
tremendous to have so many 
teams show up for the first race of 
the year. To do so well really 
gives us the intensity we wanted 
to take into the rest of lhe SUIOI)." 

Overall, 600 l'IICeft cy~1ed in 
the two races, including many 
professional teams.

Ahh, life on the open sea, at 

home on the rolling waves. Those 
who haven't yet had the 0pportu-

sparkling waters of San Diogo are 
missing out. 

The UCSD sailing team knows 
the calm and peacefulness of life 
out on the ocean, but it combines 
this tranquillity with the intense 
thrill of competition. The sailing 
team had its first meet of the sea-
son on Feb. 6 and Feb. 7 in 
Mission Bay and finished 14th 
out of a 22 team field. 

The team added new coach 
Peter Alsop this season, and has

PEP BAND: 
Meet UCSD's original 
crazy Triton spirit squad

pliment." • 

Other than its crazy cheers. the band also 
plays some unconventional songs. One exam-
ple is its rendition of The Offspring's "Pretty 
Ay For • White Guy," arranged by Pep Band 
member Aaron Rozcnek. The band's favorite, 
however. is its tribute to James Bond - a 
"007' compilation. 

Beside the cheers and the songs. the Pep 
Band is also distinguished by its crazy mem-
bers. Trombone player and UC Davis alum-
nus Steve Bush is one of the wildest partici-
pants. Also known as "That Crazy Trombone 
Guy." Bush is most famous for charging 
down the stands during "Wipeout," and for 
his ability to play upside down while joining 
in on the leapfrog dance. There are also the 
three members of the percussion section. who 
go by the names of "Sparky." "Animal" and 
"Shades." 

All of this may lead most people to think 
that the UCSD Pep Band is a mimic of the

stole the ball, firing an outlet pass for a 
Garratt layup with 13 minutes left in the first 
half. The bucket extended UCSD's lead to 14, 
and the Tritons never looked back. At the end 
of the game, however, UCSD's defense start-
ed to waiver, giving up 60 points in the sec-
ond half alone. 

"The first half, we played good defense." 
Head Coach Greg Lanthier said. "In the sec-
ond half, the defense was horrendous. Not 
playing in nine days had a part in it. The game 
was always in hand. but we didn't have that 
killer instinct we'll hopefully need later on." 

Lanthier's hope is that UCSD will need-
tough defense to play against a post-season 
opponent. Yet, while the outcome of the 
Chapman game was never in doubt, the pos-
sibility of UCSD making the playoffs still is. 
Despite their amazing 19-3 record, the 
Tritons must continue to fight for their play-
off spot. In the NCAA Division m West 
region, the top six teams make the playoffs, 
and UCSD is currently ranked No.6. 

If the postseason started today, however, 
the Tritons would be sitting at home due to a 
bizarre loophole that gUar3Jltees a Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference (SCIAC) team an automatic 
berth. Since no SCIAC team ranks in the top 
six this season, UCSD would get bumped by 
a lesser team. Unfortunately, there's not much 
the Tritons can do now but win. If UCSD 
wins its last three matches on the road. there 
should be more postseason games. 

"All we can do is play our best," Lanthier 
said. "As a 22-3 team I don't think we can be 
ignored. but as a 21-4 team the chances get a 
lot slimmer." 

Going 22-3 is easier said than done, how-
ever. The Tritons play University of 
California. Santa Cruz twice up north and

orange ball. We play six-on-six, with one 
goalie and five floor players. Then it's on! 

Let me tell you guys, hockey is fun to 
walCh, bUt it is GREAT to play. At first you 
run around like a chicken with your head cut 
off, slammins into people and taking pathe\ic 
whiffs as the ball rolls between your legs.

then travel to Newhall, Calif. to take on The 
Master's College. 

"Playing Santa Cruz is by no means an 
easy game," Assistant Coach Dave Dillon 
said. "It's hard to beat them on their home 
Hoor and we have to play them twice" 

If the Tritons can ge' past the Banana 
Slugs, their playoff hopes will come down to 
one final game against The Master's College, 
a tough NAJA school that gives 16 full athlet-
ic scholarships - not the ideal opponent for 
such a situation. 

"Because of the scholarships, they're 
always bigger and stronger than us," Dillon 
said. "They're not any better than last year 
when we beat them. but this year they've 
already beaten Robert Morris College - a 
team we lost to - by 30 points." 

Even if UCSD doesn't get into the play-
offs. the season was still a huge success. 

'This team's been fun to coach and fun to 
walCh." Lanthier said. "At the beginning of 
the season. I would have said there's no way 
we could win 20 games with this team, I 
thought 17 games was our limit. But now 
we're 19-3, the most wins since I've been 
here. That's remarkable in itself." 

___ .. Senior Mike Wall skies over II 
Chapman defender for 2 of his 16 points. 

Our hockey team is a very impressive one, 
believe it or not. We actually have some qual-
ity players. Of course we have a few morons 
like me, who are just fat and run into people. 

For the most part though, we have players 
like the Guardian's own Jake "Bucket" 
Gordon, a great sports editor and an' even 
more domilllllt scorer with his Ray Bourque-
like accuracy. We also have a couple of under-
cover Canucks on 0lIl' squad, and their her-
itage makes them immediately good. Finally, 
our goalie is a man simply known as "Burger." 
woo's like a brick wall between the pipes. 
Suffice to say, with such a great squad, we are 
sure to be heard from in the 1M playoffs. 

In closing kids, do not pass hockey off as 
some obscure lame for toothless, beer-swill-
ing Canadians. It's fun for the whole family! 

And once again, happy birthday to me.

With the PGA Tour in town this week we all have a chance to see some of the greatest golfers in 

the world shoot unbelievable scores on the Torrey Pines layouts. For most of 
us firing up a 65 like the pros are doing is a bit of a pipe dream. Just keeping 
the ball in the fairway and hitting a green in regulation once-in-a-while is 
considered success for a lot of us hacks, 

Well, next week in the WINTER SCRAMBLE GOLF TOURNAMENT you 
will get the chance to break 70 and have birdie putts all day. For those not 
familiar with team golf, a scramble format means that you only have to use 

• the best shot of all 4 players in the group. If 3 of the 4 tee shots go in the water hazard, no big 
deal. All you need is one good one to keep the team alive on that hole. Imagine not counting all 
those shots into the parking lot, driving range. water. condos or clubhouse. In this toumament 
none of them will make it to the scorecard! 

Sign-ups are already under way, and this thing is filling up fast. If you want the chance to 
play from the fairway instead of a backyard and shoot a score under par instead of under 100, 
get in touch with the 1M Dept at 534-3716 or stop by the office on the 4'" floor of RIMAC. The 
date of the event is Friday, Feb. 19. We will be playing on a course that has hosted many

only $28 and that includes green fees, refreshments. prizes and entrance into the long drive and

First of a ll, hockey is 
absolutely spectacular. For the 
Incredibly huge throng of die-
hard Coach fans, you wi" 
remember me taking up this 
very space to proclaim my new 
love for the sport last year. 

I have secn some amazing 
things so far this season. I saw 
one guy get checked up against 
the boards so hard that basically, 
his face exploded. I saw Steve 
Yzerman step up to a guy to 
play defense on him, get 
tripped, then fall face first into 
the guy's slap shot - it was not 
for the weak at heart . I've seen 
countless fights and a few guys 
get checked so hard they fly into 
the opposing team 's bench, 
where they were promptly beat-
en. In other words. this game is 
pretty damn cool. 

However. the physical play 
is just what draws you. Once 
you stan watching the game, 
you quickly discover the 
impressive amount of strategy 
and skill needed to be success-
ful on the ice. Players like 
Jaromir Jagr, Sergei Federov, 
Eric Lindros. Pavel Bure and 
the immortal Wayne Gretzky 
amaze me every night with what 
they do on the icc. 

The true way to gain an 
appreciation for what these guys 
do is to actually play the game. 
And sure enough, I am currently

UCSD's Pep Band is the original 
spirit club on campus, circa 1986. 
Now that Triton pride is making a 

comeback, we should pay these 
musicians some respect, 

Oaw Lubitzl GuardIan 
Oroovln': UCSD Pep Band members blast their fantastic tunes out 
over RIMAC Arena in the last home men's basketball game of the year. 

By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

Long before this whole Triton 
Tide spi rit group got taned. a 
group of wild students emerged at 
UCS O athletic events. soon 
hecoming well known for their rau-
cous cheers and unrelenting enthu-
siasm for Triton athletics. These 
students have never been paid to do 
it. they don't get class credit for it 
and they definitely don 't get any 
free T-shirt~ for showing up. They 
come because they love Triton ath-
letics. 

Twelve years after the group's 
birth, this devotion is still upheld 
fiy the 50 members of the UCSD 
Pep Band. As was the case in the 
band's firsL year back in 1986. 
members today are. without a 
doubt. the best fans on campus. 
They are loud, to say the least, and 
often ride the fine line between 
fanatic and obnoxious. 
Nonetheless. these crazy guys and 

gals embody school spirit at its 
best. 

Pcp Band leader Charles 
Ruggiero. a Revelle college junior. 
said that the group was conceptual-
iled over a decade ago by several 
former. high school marching band 
members who yearned for a similar 
experience at UCSD. Since 
UCSO's music department housed 
110 ~uch program, the students 
decided to create one on their own. 

For the first eight years of the 
band 's existence. the group was run 
through a faculty advisor in the 
music department. Four years ago, 
however. the music department cut 
the program. forcing the band to 
become an independent club. 

Fortunately, the athletic depart-
ment realized the group's value to 
the UCSD campus and gave the 
Pep Band a place to practice, as 
well as space to store its uniforms 
and instruments. 

Since then, the band has grown 

in size and popularity. Now, going 
to a game without the Pep Band is 
like going to a party when the kegs 
have run dry : still fun, but not as 
fun . 

And fun is the basic motto of the 
band. 

"We have a really laid-back atti-
tude," Ruggiero said. 

Leticia Garcia, a Muir junior 
and the Pep Band's secretary. said 
that it was the band's encourage-
ment of fun that first drew her to 
the group. 

"I've always enjoyed bands, and 
I was immediately impressed with 
how excited everyone was," Garcia 
said. "The fun we have here is 
unmatched by any other club on 
campus." 

The immense level of fun the 
Pep Band has is reflected by its 
cheers. One example is the notori-
ous "SEX" cheer: 

"S-E-X. What does that spell? 
Sex! What does it mean? Score! 

Score! Score!" 
Though admittedly unconven-

tional. this cheer does reflect the 
band's eccentric roots; it was popu-
larized by a bunch of Revelle biol-
ogy students. This fact also 
explains one of the band's other 
unconventional cheers - the 
"Hemoglobin," which talks about 
small intestines and large 
intestines. among other things. 
UCSD athletes say they appreciate 
these off-the-wall chants and the 
band's enthusiasm. 

"We get a lot of feedback from 
the athletes," Ruggiero said. 
"Especially from the women's bas-
ketball team, and we get [thank 
you] cards from the volleyball 
team, too." 

He also said that the band 
receives few, if any, complaints. 

"The only complaint we get is 
that we're too loud," Ruggiero 
said. "And we take that as a com-

Tritons Still Fighting for Playoff Berth 
WIN: Victory over Chapman raises record to 19-3 and brings UCSD one step closer to postseason bid 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

It 's been a season to remember 
for the UCSD men's basket-
ball team, and the last 
home game of 
the year on 
Tuesday night 
proved to be a time to 
celebrate and remember, as 
well. The event was officially 
deemed "senio~ night." as UCSO 
faced off against Chapman 
University in R1MAC Arena. The 
pumped-up Triton team dominated 
the game from the beginning, even-
tually taking the Panthers 97-88, 
raising their record to 19-3. 

Before the game, senior leaders 

Mike Wall , Adam Libby, Tyler 
Garratt, Nick Maroutsos, Joel 
Foote and Ahmad Russ were all 

honored for their contributions 
to UCSD's amazing success 

this season. The new 
Triton Tide spirit 
group was also 

present. giving out free T-
shirts as the large crowd of 

1,863 cheered loudly for UCSD's 
six seniors. 

Garratt was the star of the game, 
leading the team in both scoring 
and rebounds with 25 points and 10 
boards, respectively. Wall recorded 
15 points and 8 rebounds, while 
Foote and Sam Higgins poured in 
double digits. 

Unfonunately for the Tritons, 
Libby and Russ were both on the 
bench for Senior night. Libby 
rolled his ankle in practice, and 
Russ was hampered by the flu. 
Ironically, senior night turned out 
to be a chance for some of the 
younger Tritons to shine. 

Redshin freshmen Nick 

Christensen and Lee Nafarrete 
filled in admirably for Libby. 
Christensen tallied 4 assists and 7 
rebounds in 30 minutes of. action, 
while Nafarrete's slashing style 
brought in 16 points, including 7-9 
from the charity stripe. The game 
seemed sewn up when MaroulSOS
