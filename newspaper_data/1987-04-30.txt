Dick Shawn's death reveals inefficient seIVice 

Hartson's response times have apparently been 
altered to make the service appear more efficient.

The on-stage death of comedian 

Dick hawn during his April 17 
U SO perfonnance has raised 
sertous que tions about the 
effi ciency and integrity of San 
Diego 's emergency response 
system. 

At 8:20, Shawn lay down on 
stage dying of an apparent heart 
attack. It was a full five minutes 
bdore the confu ed audience 
reahzed his collapse was not part 
of the act and a doctor went up on 
stage to administer CPR. Another 
five minutes elapsed between the

time an ambulance unit was 
actually dispatched . And it was not 
until 8.48 that the paramedi s 
reported that they were at the

accounts , however, have said that 
the paramediCS entered the 
auditOrium closer to 8:55. 

The city of an Diego's contract 
with Hartson , the ole provider of 
paramediC services, requires that 
an ambulance be at the cene of the

The fire department is currently 
Investigating one of Hartson's 
dispatch controllers, Gordon 
Anderson, for allegedly altering 
response times. 

Although Hartson's paramedic 
operations supervisor, Mark 
Brown , refused to comment on the 
investigation because it was an 
internal matter , several 
paramediCS, who wished to remain 
anonymous for fear of lOSing their

Catalano made the announcement two 
days after University vice chancellors for 
administration met to discuss a UC task 
force advi ory repon prepared to address 
the problem of substance abuse in the 
workplace. The vice chancellors agreed 
with Catalano'S recommendation to 
abstain from implementing a drug testing 
program. 

Voter turnout fell to 8 
percent with only 1,029 ballots 
cast by the 12,900 eligible 
voters on campus. The first 
election drew an 18.8 percent 
voter turnout. 

Marchick plans to go ahead 
with all of his campaign 
promises stating, 'There's no 
reason for me to reinvent lold 
ideas] ." 

Changing of the guard: Dave Marchick (I) will soon replace 
John Riley (r) as A.S. president. 

"Given the fluid state of the law with 
respect to substance testing programs and 
the haracter of the University of 
California a a public employer," Catalano 
said, "it is my view that the University 
should not engage in any drug testing 
programs relative to substance abuse. 
Current University personnel poli ies and 
pro ce dure s adequately address 
performance issues which may arise due 
to sub rance abuse." 

A task force compri ed ofUC em ployee 
and labor relatlons specialists was 
com missioned to review per onnel

Although Marchick was 
accused by preSidential 
candidate Eric Weiss and 
certain A.S. Council members 
of laying claim to projects 
which had been instituted by 
others, the support he 
established early in the 
campaign held true. 

Marchick insists his ideas 
were original. saying Weiss' 
remarks stemmed from a 
"negative campaign. It's ironi 
that lWei ] talked about me

Presidential runner-up

"had a good feeling for how

Friend did not think 
changing his campaign

hurt his chances of Winning. 
"No, it didn't hurt me at all. It

Cesar Chavez to speak 
at Peterson Hall 

Cesar Chavez, preSident of the 
United Farm Workers of Amenca, AFL-
CIO, Will speak on the international 
grape boycott at 4:30 pm, May 4, in 
room 108 of Peterson Hall. 

Sponsored by MECM, a Chicano 
student organization, the talk IS free and 
open to the public. Chavez will also 
show a brief Video on 'The Wrath of 
Grapes." Accordmg to Chavez, thiS 
slogan has become the theme of the 
boycott which is trying to bring 
attention to the pOtential danger to both 
Vineyard workers and consumers with 
the apphcatlon of pesticides by growers. 
The boycott is also an attempt to 
pressure grape growers into supporting 
union certifIcation elections. 

The 60-year-old Chavez founded and 
heads the first successful farm workers' 

union in U.s. hi tory. [-[t' served as 
director of the Communit}' ervlce 
Organization, a bamo-based self-help 
group of California Mexican-Amencans,

New bill targets 
under-aged motorists 

MotOrists between the ages of 15 and 
21 are the ta rgets of a new state bill 
designed to dissuade young indiViduals 
from using alcohol or drugs. 

The bill, proposed Monday by Senator 
Art Torres CD-Los Angeles), calls [or a 
year long driver's license suspension of 
individuals under the age of 21 who are 
convicted of any offenses involving 
alcohol or Illegal drugs. 

Torres feels that the bill IS a good 
deterrent due to the value young people 
have for the driver's licenses. 

Unlike current laws, the proposed bill 
allows for the suspension of a motor 
vehicle operator's permit as a result of 
non-dnvlllg offenses, such as bemg 
drunk In a public place, purchase of 
alcohol by a person under 21, and 
possession of less than one ounce of 
marijuana.

UClA law students

Fifteen UCLA students were alTested 
while protesting proposed changes in 
the universi ty' law sc hool admission

arre ted on ch<lrges of trespaSSing m a

The policy changes are designed to 
Improve the unlverslly's passage rate on 
the Calif,)rnI3 bar cxamin,l[ion. 
Prote tors say the changes could red uce 
ethnic minorities' chances of geuing 
UCLA law degrees. 

Last year, 88 perce nt of UCLA law 
students who had been admirted under 
standard admiss ion reqUirements passed 
the test; however, among those admitted 
under a set of less stringent admission 
criteria aimed at expanding the

The resulting advisory report was 
d istributed to campuses ancl I.lboratories 
for review and comment over Ihe past two 
months. 

The repon recommended that rhe 
University determine whether there ,Ire 
posllions which arc "cmi cal" due to the 
nature of the work performed, thai 
presu mably might need to be drug tested. 
The task force called f, r the establishment

Identify what pOS itions, if any, should be 
deSignated as "criri cal." 

The report also said th ,\[ testing might 
be appropriate in cases wh ere there is 
probable cause to believe an employee's 
Job performance IS bemg adversely 
affected by substance abuse . [t did no 
recommend that rlrug testing be reqUired 
of these employees. 

Catalano said a legal analys is of case law 
in the area of drug testing, conducted by 
UC counsel Marciaj. Canning, persuaded 
him and the vi e chancellors for 
adminisrra ti on that the University should 
refrain from embarking on any testing 
progra ms until more definite guidelines 
are estabhshed. 

"[t is clear that mandatory urine or blood 
testing of public employees In noncritical

Catalano said that the UniverSity will 
actively pursue task force suggestions, 
such as strengthening the University

employee organizations in constructively

r-----------, United States 'peace' 
doctrine questioned 
By LETICIA VlUARREAL, Staff Wnter 

Arms comrol was again discussed last Tuesday at the latest. 
luncheon seminar in a series sponsored by the Institute on Global 
Conflict and Cooperation ([GCC) 

The speaker was Dr. Johan Galtung, [GCC lecturer and founder 
and fonner director of the [nternational Peace Research Institute in 
Oslo. 

In hi s speech, entitled "Alternative Defense Concepts ," Galtung 
commented tersely that "IGCC has very little to do with peace 
research, practi cally speaking, nothing." [-[e aid peace research "is . 
not an emerging field ; it is a quite well -established field 10 many 
places 10 the world [andl the United States is among them ." 

Galtung went on to call the Unired tates "that great unknown to 
American polmcal scientists" and remarked he has failed to detect 
in many Alllerican graduate studems "any concrete knowledge 
ab0ut their country." 

"[ don't find IhatAmericans have peace concepts," he said. "They 
have hegemonial concepts." 

He called the belief that nuclear deterrence has prevented war in 
Europe a "myth ," s<lying there has not been "enough peace in 
Europe." He Cited the Uni ted tatc~ ' and the United Kingdom's 
Involvement In the "cxtremely bloody war in Greece· as an 
example 

While acknowledging that EUfllpeans "have had twO horrible 
IIwaSlons b}' the SOV lct Union," (Yugoslavia in 1956 and 
CzechQ!,lov,lkl,l In 1968), Galrung 5.IW the twiet actions caused In

Inefficient service 
Continued from page I

it will Jeopardize th,lI abihty to 
mllnlmr. 

A cou ple 01 paramedlc~ have 
Said that the fire depanmel1t 's 
dl~patchers have also been known 
to falsify a time , "Sometimes they 
do it because it creates a paper mill 
down at dispatch if the call was 
ove r ten minutes, so they do it to 
save themselves or a controller they 
like, the paperwork ," a fonner city 
paramedic said . 

Falsifying times has Significant 
consequences because Hartson is 
fined if a units does not make 11 to 
the sene of the emergency within 
ten minutes, in addition , the 
co mpany must make the ten 
mmute response time 93 percent 
of the caUs or they arc in breach of 
contract. 

Hartson recently released a 
report claiming a 97 percel1l 
response rate under ren mmutes. 
Several paramedics, however, 
question the validity of thiS repon 
because of a practl e known as 
"tlmeshavlng." 

The sa me paramediCS have 
revealed events which pOint out 
not only the system's ineptness, 
but also mdividual anempts to 
make the emergency system 
appear more responsive than it IS. 

They explained that because 
enonnous pressure is put on the 
paramedi CS to make it to the scene 
wnhin ten millute s, they often use 
Imle tricks to make it appear that 
they arrive on time. Since the clock 
docs not stan until the unit 
responds to the dispatcher's caU, 

somelillles th e pammedlcs will 
W,lIt unlil they are on the road to 
acknowledge a caU 

AnOther method is to wait and 
respond after th e ca ll is 
redlspatched for a second lime. 
Th iS gives them a few extra 
minutes head stan. One of the 
most common ways of deceiving 
the clock is to re port that they arc 
"a t scene" before they are actually 
there. 

"You ger guys calling 'at scene' 

"Delays happen 
every day because 
there are not enough 
paramedic units avail-

five blocks away from where thei r 
victim IS lying. Let's say for 
exam pic, we're going to a rraller 
park or an apartment complex, 
what they want us to do is caU in as 
soon as we reach the front area 
even if it is an apartment which is 
at the back of the complex and it 
might take another five minutes to 
reach rhe vi tim . The fire 
department and the police often 
do the same thing," one paramediC 
said. 

Several paramediCS sugge ted 
thiS was what happened at UC D. 
They said the paramedics probably 
called 'a t seene' as soon as they 
reac hed La Jolla Village Drive and 
Gilman. hawn's perfonnance was 
at Mandeville Auditorium located 

DON'T MISS IT f 

In Ihe hean of the campus a 
couple of minutes away from those ' 
cros, streets. 

The fire crew which responded 
to the hawn call claims to have 
been ,It the scene at 8:42 . They 
would have m,ldc It there sooner If 
they did not get los t and gl) to 
another thea ter on campus first. 

Even with their miX-Up, the fire 
depal1ment arrived SIX minutes 
before the paramediCS who 
claimed to have covered at least tcn 
miles from thcir station in Mira 
Mesa in ten minures and 32 
seconds. ThiS response time putS 
them at the scene at 8:48. This 
contradicts eyewirness accounts 
which reported seeing them in the 
auditolium closer to 8:55. 

One of the paramedics on duty 
said he was surpri sed that they 
made it there in ten minutes and 
32 seconds because UCSD is a "far 
haul" but denied any knowledge of 
timeshaving 

Cutbacks In un It ava ilability 
havc Increased the "far hauls" and 
dec rease d the likelIhood of 
acceptable response times. The 
unit whic h nonnally responds to 
UCSD during the day IS only In 
operation from nine In the mon ng 
to nme at night. Howeve r, dunng 
the night of Shawn 's fatal heart 
attack , this unit (135) was Sitting in 
the garage motionless as the fire 
truck next to It responded to the 
call. 

"Our policy 15 If the system is 
unstressed at 8:00 then that Unit 
gets cur loose (for that hour), and 
other Units pick up the slack," 
Hartson paramedic supervisor 
Mark Brown said. This policy COSt 
Shawn at least six minutes of 
emergency care and pOSSibly hiS 
life . 

Trying to explain the delay of 

emergency serVllC , Dave 
I3lng,lman , a supervisor of 
par<lmcdlC opera ti ons at [-[<lrtson,

paramediCS on duty at Mira Mesa 
who sa id eHhelr their unit or the 
Cla iremont unit are the first

are dOing. Supervisor Brown also 
conflITns thiS. 

The delay of emergency care can

took the call to be dispatched . The 
ca ll , which was made to 9[ 1 at 
8:32, was still being bounced 
around by fire department 
dispatchers until 8:37 when the 
fire department and the 
ambulance stalion finally received 
the caU. 

"[t can take them up to two or 
three minutes to dispatch a call ," 
said a paramediC who Wished to 
remalll anonymous "All the

then sent across the room by 
computer to another dispatcher

IS a very antlquated one even with 
the upgraded system they are still

"Delays I In emergency carel 
happen everyday because there are 
not enough paramedic units 
available . I think a lot of 
paramedics In the back of their 
minds were hoping that something 
like this, where someone famous 
was involved , would happen 
sooner or later, wanting it to be 
sooner than later. Hopefully now 
some changes will be made," a 
paramedic said . 

One fire offiCial , who also felt It 
best to remain anonymous, 
defended Hartson sayi ng, "Before 
people start assessing blame they 
better look at the response of the 
audience. Those people should do 
a lot of soul searching. How could 
they si t by that long and not reahze

Indeed , for the first five minutes, 
the audience believed that Shawn's 
graceful descent to the floor was 
part of hiS act. During these first 
few minutes the audience laughed 
and made catcalls not realiZIng the 
seventy of the situanon. It was not 
until a phYSICian from the crowd, 
who was concerned about the 
comedian's lack of movement, 
went on stage and started CPR that 
the tragedy of the eve ning became 
apparent. 

"The funny thing was, was that 
his timing was JUSt so good," 
recalled Jorge Segura, the stage 
hand who went out three times to 
che k on Shawn during the first 
five mi nutes he laid on the floor. 
"The way he set up his whole joke

STROKE IT UP THE MIDDLE 

Hey, you want to talk about an action-packed game. well our team of the week, 
~a", UPTH. ~prOliided ~ in attendance withjust that in 
their last game. Stroke It trufTl)ed HONKY DONG 4-3 in a pitcher's duel that came 
close to the ftrst r»-hitter of the season, Yes, that's right. a no-hitter in coedl 
Through four of the six innings both teams combined for a whopping five hits. 
That's incredible when you consider the tact that in coed softball the teams pitch to 
themselve. I tell ya, I was on the edge of my ~at the whole game - flt!Ver a dull 
moment I 

Then it happened, Adam Uet> stepped up to the plate with one man on irld 
blasted a two run homer deep into the centerfield seats. This began what turned 
out to be a four run inning, a lead that was insurmountable as Honky Dong could 
only muster a mere three runs. 

Once again, congratulations to the hard hitting team of Stroke It 4l The Middle. 
In a privili~ for us at Bud Ught to bestow this honor on such high caliber team.

Commentary-

Can the Contras disturb the Sandinistas? 
By THOMAS lEBHAR , Intern talf Wntrr 

So it seems the contras will get 
the $40 million the Uni ted States 
Congress has promised them. 
With or without the moderate 
influence of Anuro Cruz, With or 
without a chance in hell of Winning 
anything positive for anyone. Like 
the nch third-world leader who 
owns the most advanced arrack 
planes but has no one to fly them, 
the United States, in the style that 
has characterized ItS foreign pohcy 
for generations, marches into its 
difficulties wallet-first, with litlle or 
no understanding of what it is 
purchasing. Apan from the contra 
resistance being a fantastic and 
often used excuse for the 
Sandinistas to do whatever they 
feel is necessary to keep power, 
giving aid to the infighting and 
sightless contra forces is 
logistically non-sensical. 

Cruz's defection from UNO, 
which hardly disturbed the 
hierarchies of power in the contra 
infrastructure, only served to 
expose the ineffectuality of UNO 
(U nited icaraguan Opposition), 
the so-called political anm of the 
Nicaraguan resistance. UNO was 
created to appease Amencan 
politicians who feared that the 
conlt'Js were a military force with 
no ambitions of restoring civihan 
rule , and Cruz (a former 
Sandinista) was brought among 
them to give U 0 an image of 
pohtical moderation . Cruz , who 
was never given much power in 
U 0 , was frustrated in his 
attempts to create democratic 
reforms among its leaders and to 
get the contra military faction to 
follow UNO's dictates. Said Cruz ,"' 
was calling for unity, unity, unity, 
and they came to consider me an 
adversary." The fighting contras' 
view of UNO was well summarized 
by one of their leaders in a quote 10 
U.S. News and World Report 
journalists: "Who are they [UNOI 
to come tell us how we should fight 
this warT' So much for foresight, 
control and democracy. 

But the contra fighters don 't 
need U O's help to commit 
suicide and slaughter, II 'S one 
thing they seem quite able to do 
them elves. It's Simple enough for 
them to raid governmcnt 
cooperatives and fanm communl-
tles and bomb idealistic college 
students who spend their 
vacations in the fields with mortar 
ftre from the hills , but this, as the 
Reagan Administration insists , is 
not the goal. The goal is the 
removal of the Sandinista 
government - people who 
command an anny of over 60,000 
well-trained soldiers; who receive 
$350 million a year in Sovtet 
military aid ; who have 
indoctrinated schoolchildren 
marching in the streets chanting 
"let's fight against the yankee, 
enemy of humanity."lf the contras 
are the prime moving force, the 
Sandinistas have little fear of 
displacement. Couple the comras' 
lack of numbers and organization 
with a lack of competence and this 
becomes even clearer. Several 
weeks ago the comras hit the 
capital ci ty of Managua for the first 
time m over four years. Creeping 
up m the night , several contras 
planted explOSives on an electrical 
tower within the city limits. After 
the bombs exploded and the dust 
settled, the tower stood intact, the 
cables were up and the electriciry 
was undisturbed, although a few 
windows were broken. Said a 
Reagan Administration official, 
"these guys are like the gang that 
couldn't shoot straight." 

In the event that the contras did 
gain significant ground in 
Nicaragua, it would be beyond 
their ability to keep it. First of all, a 
revolution of this SOrt reqUires 
popular local insurrections, 
something which the contras will 
not be able to inspire. The 
revolution against Somoza was of 
this type, but now the people of 
Nicaragua are indoctrinated,

unsure and not miserable and 
angry enough to do it again. 
Furthermore, the people will nO[ 
support I he comras becausc the, 
arc their main target. Being afraid 
of directly confronting large 
contingents of Sandinista People's 
Army troops, they anack mostly 
government cooperatives, rural 
stores and power supplies. In other 
words they attack those ciVilians 
who associate with the 
government, but considering the 
expansive reach of the active 
Nicaraguan government, this 
means almost any Nicaraguan 
could be a contra target. The 

comras have also nO[ compiled a 
very impressive human rights 
record . It mcludes the standard 
atrocities we've come to expect 
from modem rebels: rape , torture, 
beatings, etc . The comras are 
attacking the people they wish to 
rule, democratically it is said. 
Stephen Kinzer, the chief foreign 
correspondent in Nicaragua forthe 
Nr:w Yom Times, a rnan who has 
resided there since before the 
revolution, said this about the U.S. 
and the rebels: "it shows how little 
the United States knows about 
what's going on here that we would 
throw in with the one group that 

most everyone in Nicaragua fears." 
There is a panicular amount of 

momentum that must be instilled 
within a population to make It 
topple over into revolutlon , and 
this i usually detennined by the 
naturc of the regime. However, the 
Sandinistas have not inspired 
enough hatred within their 
population , and the contras, by 
presenting themselves as the 
alternative. must only be damping 
revolutionary fervor. The peoplc of 
Nicaragua arc not willi ng to figh~ 
another revolution, and without 
the support of these people , the 
contl'Js are not going to get one,

Protest the arrest 
Editor: 

I was horrifred - and ashamed 
- to read of the arrest of one of the 
HSS "Wallwriters" last week, at the 
instigation of Professor Metzger. , 
have been a writmg instructor for 
three years, and have always been 
delighted and inspired by the work 
on the HSS walls (in fact, I take my 
students to study the "graffiti" as an 
example of "alternate" rhetOric). 
Here are students wnting, not 
because they bave to , but of their 
own free Will, and of matters 
penrnem to d .. ··lr (and aU our) 
lives. This is wming that is doing 
something in the wo rld : 
com municating , expressing , 
creating "communitas," giving 
startling pleasure to any reader. 
Just last week I read on "the walls" 
this moving response to a writer 
disenchanted with "life," and with 
wall-writing: 

COSMA' COME BACK! 
Life is not pointless! We (me) need 
people like 
you here. Don 't let one or two bad 
apples spoil 
the waUs for you. You'lIfind some 
bullshil 

wherever you go. but you don 't 
have to let it 
tum you off oj life ... I 100 came 
here to 
Jind Jr iends. .. caring. 
understanding people ... 
and I've Jound some. Isn 't that 
what life is about? 
Please come back ... ij [Xople leave 
the walls 
the walls will die . .. and the pan oj 
me that is iterI' 
will die also . .. DON'T LEAVE. 
Far from being the rantings of 

monstrous criminals. this is real 
writing - not the dry. distant, 
contrived, unmotivated academ-
esc of so many composition 
classrooms. How unjust that these 
articulate and inSightful anists 
should be pe rsecuted for 
expressing themselves in the 
tradition of Genet and Onon, and 
other great visionaries of our time. 
Perhaps the wallwriters are too 
subversive for Professor Metzger's 
liking? Perhaps their challenge to 
his orderly - and hierarchical -
starus quo disturbs him? But how 
sad that in art institution which 
supposedly encourges c ritical 
thought a professor should be so 
obsessive and mindless a rule-

also have had Rosa Parks arrested

What to do if you sight a Mountain Fresh Rainier 
If you see something that you cannot explain. what hould you do? 
Well . the Rainier Brewery's advice is first to use common sense, Think about 
it for awhile. Quite often you will shortly realize that what you saw ha a rational 
explanation. 

a state law enforcement officer, Often such reports are invest igated immed iately. 
and if the MFR's cannot be tracked down, the information is passed on to the 
proper authorities. 

If you are convinced that you have seen a Mountain Fresh Rainier. you can 
report it to the manager of any local grocery store, liquor store or tavern, Each 
store has at lea t one employee who is assigned to such phenomena. If there is no 
grocery base in your near vicinity. you can give your report to any bartender or to

attcmpted !O revive Shawn. 

One of the doctors, a 
cardiologist, had somebody go to 
his lab to retrieve a defibrillator. 
The machine, however, was not 
adequate and manual resuscitation 
was continued. 

Doctor Benjamin Kanter, who 
was one of the do tors who ran on 
stage to administer CPR to Shawn. 
definitely felt time could have been 
a factor in hawn's survival. "What 
you want to do with these people is 
get to them within the fi~t couple 
of mll1utes," Kanter said 

After the paramedics finally 
arrived, th e do tors continued to 
work closely with hawn. "Using 
the drugs and the equipment that 
the paramedics brought with them, 
we were able to establish a normal 
rhythm and blood pressure." said 
Dr. Richard Podolln who was 
outside tlying to get a ticket when 
somebody called for a doctor and 
he went on stage to aSSist in CPR. 

"We we re hoping for rhe best

We could palpate a pressurc. We 
had a blood pre~su re that lastecl

ParamedicJim Royal remember 

It differently. "We had no bp 
Iblood pressure!, we had a pulse 
that lasted maybe thiny seconds, 
but no bp." he said. 

As hawn was be i ng placed onto 
a gurney. his pulse rate which the 
doCtors and paramedics brit;lIy 
reVived was lost and never 
reestablished .

Frisbee 
club tries 
to make 
Nationals 
By MARK PRESSMAN, 5raff Writer 

'UCSD's Ultimate Frisbee Club is 
heading to Stanford this weekend 
in the hunt for a bid to the 
Nationals held at Penn State this 
year. 

This Tmons Ultimate Disc Club 
is one of the twelve west coast 
teams going into the Rcgionals (It 
StAnford. And the unheralded club 
got there with "a lot of hard work 
and team effon," according to 
captain Tom Hall. 

Defeating some of the toughest 
competition along the west coast 
will be no mean feat for these guys. 
But if the likes of UCSC and UCSB 
find theITISelves surprised, don't 
you be. UCSD's team effort and 
dedication have made them 
formidable this season, and 
although the odds are against this 
'no superstar' squad, they just may 
be one of the three teams from the 
twelve to go to the Nationals. 

"We're a little behind 'national 
quality' In the strict sense," said 
Hall, "but it is definitely not beyond 
us." 

Ultimate Frisbee is officially 
played on a ·football·sized' field 
with seven players on each side. 
With all players constantly 
poSitioning both defenSively and 
offensively, the game is grueling. 
Basically, one team tries 10 move 
the disc into the defending team's 
end zone. throwing the disc from 
player to player. 

UCSD plays three types of zone 
defense as well as a man-IO-man, 
depending on how the game is 
shaping up. OffenSively, the 
Tritons spread out the field and

have the "handlers" control the 
disc and move it out to the 
"cuners" 

A speCial feature of the game is 
that there are no referees. This 
"honor system" between the 
players, which relies on the honest 
judgment of the players toward 
fouls, has its pros and cons, as Hall 
and others will admit. But in the 
end, this referee system, or lack of 
it, is a tribute to the game and its 
spirit of competition. Even in the 
Nationals, it's just the two teams 
and the one disc. 

Among the UCSD usual starting 
seven arc the tri-captains Ian 
tewart , David Butcher, Tom Hall. 

along with Adam Berke, Phil 
Kramer , Frank Colbert and 
Howard OSlo In comraSlto some of 
the other teams, UCSD's club lacks 
substantial height (their tallest 
bei ng 6'l "); but as Tom Hall 
remarked , "when the game has 
progressed to the stage we're at, the 
player's disc skills are critical, and 
although height is an added 
advantage, it is by no means 
decisive." 

The toumament this weekend 
in Stanford will have round-robin 
rounds. followed by playoff 
matches to decide the three teaITIS 
that will advance to the Nationals. 
The contests will to to l5 or 2l 
points and can last over an hour.

Team trying to defend title 

Rough going for women's 
water polo at DC tourney 
By BRIAN now, rafj Wntl'r 

T HE UCSD women's water polo team, in their final tunc-up before the National 
ChampIOnships, went 0-3 at the 
All-Cal tOurney 111 Davis. 

The Tritons lost games to UC 
Santa Barbara, UC Davis and UC 
Irvine while only managing a tiC 
with UC Berkele y. In the 
lOurnament, the team contmued 
the inconsistent play that has 
characterized its season. 

Throughout the year, UCSD has 
received sound play from its 
defense. It is at the offensive end 
that there have been problems. 
Inconsistence on offense have 
caused the Tritons (7-6-2) 
problems only a year after winning 
the National Championship. 

Despite the problems, Coach 
Denny Harper is confident that 
this team's play is still ahead of 
them in the National 
Championships. The team, which 
lost seven players from last year's 
championship, is coming tOgether 
and should defend their tide, he 
believes. 

Goalie Jefi Paulsen. 

Harper discounts the team's 
perfonnance at the All-Cal tourney, 
"the best part of our offensive game 
is mar:-up advantages. In Northern 
California (where the tourney was 
held), they playa rougher style of 
polo and call very few kick-outs. 
So, we had few opportunities to 
take advantage of man-up 
situation. In Southern California, 
we play mueh more of a finesse 
game and the referees call more 
kick-outs. This year's Nationals are 
being held in lrvine and we'll have 
Southern California referees." 

Coach Denny Harper advises his team. 

In order to win the title for a 
second straight year. they will need 
strong performances from Janell 
Lowe, Carin Crawford, Raeann 
Rivera and goalkeeper Jefi Paulsen. 
If they do, and they can get 
everyone involved III their offense,

then their title hopes look good. 
"This year, we found OUt what 

it's like to be defending the 
national champions. Everybody is 
fired up to play us. We have to play 
consistently at our best to win," 
said Harper. ~

Making a musical pick 

by mark pinkus 
Some people love him, 

some people hate him. Yet, no 
one can help but be impressed 
by him. On his latest record 
set, "Sign 0' the Times," 
Prince undertakes the role of 
producer, arranger, compos-
er, and, of course, performer. 

While most groups 
nowadays search for the top 
producers, songwriters, and 
studio musicians, for "Sign 0' 
the Times," Prince simply 
tra veled from his home studio 
in Minneapolis to a studio in 
L.A. to lay down all the vocals 
and instrumentation to the 16 
song package. But, again, 
Prince was never one to follow 
the norm. 

After nine albums and 
about the same amount of 
musical changes, no one can 
be sure of wha t to expect from 
the once "purple wonder." 
The new album, rather than 
surging onward to a new 
sound, acts more as a bizzare 
sort of greatest hits album. All 
songs are unreleased, but the 
sounds have been heard for 
more than a decade in "Dirty 
Minds," to "1999," to 
"Parade." 

The album does start out on 
an exceptionally high note 
though with the first single 
from the album, "Sign 0 ' the 
Times," containing both 
thought-provoking lyrics and 
a strange dance beat. "It's 
reali, sill" no! When a rocket 
ship explodes and ewrybod, stiLL 
U(lnts to fl,! Some sa, a man 
ain't happy unless a man trwly 
dies," sings Prince in his usual 
high pitched voice. 

The next twO songs, "Play 
in the Sunshine" and 
"Housequake," are two fun, 
upbeat and meaningless dance 
songs which would have fit 
right in with "1999." But the 
fun is only beginning as side 
two opens with a song aptly 
titled "It." With lines like" It 
feels so good is must be a crime," 
it is dear what the 'it' refers to, 
but how nicely it blends in 
with the often rrv~rse~ 
subject matter a Prince s 
earlier years .

Fleshtones 

by sean duffy 
Described by Bill Milhizer 

as •• about the happiest band in 
rock and roll" the Fleshrones 
are back. Tonight their tour 
arrives at SDSU's Montezuma 
Hall and their new album 
"Fleshtones vs . Reality " 
proves to be as good as ever. 
Recently, I was able to ramble 
aimlessly, under the pretext of 
an interview, with Milhizer. 
the Fleshtones' drummer. 

Since their "S peed 
Connection II" album and 
subsequent tour which 
brought the Fleshtones to San 
Diego in the summer of 1985, 
a lot has happened with the 
band . Lead vocals, Peter 
Zaremba released a solo 
album and bassest Jan Marek 
Pakulski "split" and was 
replaced by Robert Warren. 
All this has done little to 
hinder the Fleshtones and, 
according to Milhizer, James 
Ball who produced Zaremba's 
solo album has greatly 
imporved the Fleshtones' 
studio technique. When 
asked about the future of the 
Fl.eshtones, Milhizer respond-
ed, "True we've been together 
for ten years but the Fleshtones 
career is in its infancy." 

Milhizer, when asked about 
San Diego, said. "We're very 
happy we're playing in San 
Diego, (especially because) 
after sound-<heck we mad 
dash to Tijuana and go 
directly to the Agua Caliente 
Dog track." Milhizer also 
looks forward to San Diego 
for the weather and the 
beaches. "Believe me there'd 
be surfing happening in the 
band if we were not stranded 
on the island of Manhattan." 
Alon" with this, Milhizer is 
looking forward to working 
with the very Southern 
Californian band, Agent 
Orange, who will be opening 
for the Fleshtones. 

The Fleshtones musical 
influences are mainly rhythm

AMM 
by bret thompson 

In a time where popular 
music seems to be turning into 
a battery of ca tch-phrases and 
endless repetitions of the 
three guitar chords, England 's 
AMM sticks out like a golden 
ray. These four musicians 
attempt (and succeed) to 
drive their music into the 
realms of aural subconscious-
ness. This is done entirely 
with contemporary instrum-
ents: guitar, drums, keys, and 
bass here . Well, actually 
guitar, percussion, piano, and 
cello (to handle the low end), 
which is basically the same 
thing. The twist is the 
unorthodox approach AMM 
uses toward their composit-
ions. For instance, Keith 
Rowe, who is a trained 
painter, utilizes an amplified 
cocktail mixer, transistor 
radio, and violin bow in 
performance (sound familiar 
Zepp fans?). 

As individuals, AMM · 
(Edwin Prevost, percussion; 
Rohen de Saram, cello; John 
Tilbury, piano; and Keith 
Rowe, guitar) has worked 
with such well -known 
composers as Lucian Berio, 
John Cage, Barry Guy, 
Pousseur, Shostakovitch, and 
the late Cornelius Cardew, 
who was one of AMM's 
founding members. 

The underlying appeal of 
the quartet's 21-year 
existence is their partially 
arranged but mostly 
improvised performance. 
Their works are meshed up 
against each other to achieve a 
relentless 90-minute cycle 
(with a break halfway through 
so you can buy a T-shirt 
and/ or cookies and milk). 
AMM's marriage of post-
modernism, a jazz rhythmic 
structure. and the textures of 
sea of contrast. can only be 
d esc ribed as an aural 
rea lization of Rauchenberg or

Intere~ting Project 
by robert leone 

"Project X," starring 
Matthew Broderick and Helen 
Hunt and a barrel of monkeys, 
is a good film, especially if 
you're a member of the 
Animal Liberation Front. 

The plot is simple. 
Perpetual Air Force goof-off 
Jimmy Garrett, comically 
portrayed by Broderick, is 

assigned to an animal research 
project. He bonds with one of 
the chimps, named Virgil, and 
discovers that Virgil knows 
sign language. Then Broderick 
discovers why the Air Force is 
teaching chimps to "fly" 
aircraft simulators. They want 
to test the flying abilities of

DaY~f Dead art rep-resents: 
Artistic traditions 

by nigel lindeman 
albeit in death - are on loan 
from the Centro Cultural in 
Tijuana, Baja California, and 
are scheduled to remain until 
May 16. 

Brian Shuck 

after a delirious illness in 
which he envisioned a long 
road lined with skeletons, 
dragons, and other monsters 
which implored him to "go 
back and live ." Linares 
recovered and soon began 
making the "alabrijes" 
(dragons) for which he was to 
become famous. 

and partake in feasts. 
Making "Day of the Dead " 

sculptures has become a 
family tradition in the Linares 
household . Linares is assisted 
by his son, Miguel, and many 
grandchildren, whose works 
appear in the show as well . 

UCSD's Grove Gallery is 
currently featuring an 
exhibition by renowned paper 
artist Pedro Linares and 
others, which centers upons 
works created for the Mexican 
holiday, "The Day of the 
Dead . " These playful 
creatures, which consist 
largely of paper-mache 
skeletons going about the 
daily business of living -

Linares apprenticed under 
his father, who made "Judas," 
figures for the processions of 
the Semana Saneta (the week 
before Lent) . He switched to 
making "Day of the Dead" art An example of Linares' work. 

For Mexicans, "The Day of 
the Dead" is an important 
holiday which combines 
Roman Catholic and pre-
Hispanic traditions. Families 
visit the graves of relatives 
with bread and other foods, in 
accordance with the Aztec 
belief that the spirit, too, 
needs to be nourished. They 
also prepare altars at home 

The Grove Gallery will 
sponsor two receptions, the 
first from 1-4 pm on May 1 to 
coincide with UCSD's Cinco 
de Mayo celebrations, and the 
second from 11 am - 4 pm 
on May 3 to correspond with 
UCSD's Open House. The 
Gallery is open from 10am-

and blues and the bands of the 
'60s English invasion . 
Milhizer also notes the U.S. 
bands of the '60s, like the 
Kingsmen and Paul Ret'ere and 
the Raiders , were even a larger 
influence because they were 
"sleazier." According to 
Milhizer, "the Kingsmen were 
about as sleazy as you could 
get. I prefer that over the kind 
of cleaner image that a lot of 
the bands from England had 
to protray at the time." 
Although the Fleshtones were 
at the forefront of the "neo-
sixties revivalism" they 

consider themselves definitel y 
a "rock and roll" band. The 
Fleshtones goal "is to try to 
open up those strictly 
commercial stations to rock 
and roll. Air Supply is not a 
rock and roll band."

Prince 
Continued from page 1 

The real gem off of side two 
is the neo -physchedelic 
sounding tune "Starfish and 
Coffee." This song could have 
been a definite hit from either 
of Prince's past two efforts, 
"Around the World in a Day" 
and " Parade." This album 
should become a success off 
of this song. 

The album leaves the 
listener wondering what really 
is on the mind of the man who 
interviews as rarely as he 
makes public appearances, 

AMM 
Contin ued from page 1

Some critics' reflections on 

AMM include the following. 
"Toge ther they play

consistent subject matter of 
side three, which contains "U 
Got the Look," " If 1 Was 
Your Girlfriend," " Strange 
Relationship," and "I Could 
Never Take the Place of Your 
Man," is any indication, then 
this paisely-studded fellow 
thinks only about women and 
his interactions with them. 

The concluding side sums 
up the blend of various 
musical styles and subjects 
discussed throughout the 
album perfectly by juxtapos-
ing a mix of songs such as a 
powerful song about 
Christianity, "The Cross,"

problems, " It's Gonna Be a 
Beautiful Night," a live 
performance of a fun dance 
song that features "Revolu-
tion" as the back-up band, 
and, concludes with "Adore," 
a song about desiring a 
woman. 

For one man to have put 
this all together is remarkable; 
hats must be tipped to Prince. 
Fot those that hate Prince, this 
album isn't strong enough to 
change thei r views, but, for 
those that love Prince you can

Intimate Exchanges 
The Old Globe Theatre is currently featuring some 

"local," as in UCSD, talent in it's current production 
" Intimate Exchanges." Taking the male lead is William 
Anton, a guest professor as well as former graduate 
student in the UCSD theatre department . Anton shares 
the stage with Kandis Chappell, with both actors assuming 
a total of three different roles as the play progresses. 

" Intimate Exchanges" is actually two plays in a related 
series of comedies written by Alan Ayckbourn - all of 
which revolve around the misadventures of the Teasdales, 
their maid Sylvie, and a handyman, Lionel Hepplewick. 
Two plays in the cycle are being presented by the Globe 
under the heading of "Intimate Exchanges: A Pageant" 
featuring the above mentioned characters, and "Affairs in 
a Tent" which adds the characters of Irene Pridworthy 
and Miles, Rowena 's husband. 

Both "A Pageant" and " Affairs in a Tent" will be 
running through' May 3. 

Tickets can be reserved at the Simon Edison Centre for, 
the Performing Arts box office - 295-2255.

addressed directly by 
dialogue, but rather by way of 
convoluted action. This was 
typi cal of Marivaux, 
according to Bogart, in 
addition to his interest in 
"couples, relationships 
between the sexes, and 
patterns in love." 

The set design (by Victoria 
Petrovich) and choreography 
(by Bogart), combined with 
the music (by Michael Roth 
and Steven Erb) generate a 
dynamic atmosphere . 
Although the monologues 
were repetitive at times, the 
play was thought-provoking 
and provided an excellent 
evening's entertainment. The 
cast itself was energetic, with 
each member contributing to 
an overall impressive 
performance . Carolyn

irradiated pilots. Eventually, 
it's Virgil's turn to go into the 
test chamber. 

Garrett calls Teri (played 
by Hunt), the psychologist 
who trained Virgil to sign, but 
he gets cold feet in the middle 
of his call. Teri, who all this 
time thought Virgil was in a 
children's zoo, manages to 
track Garrett down. They 
arrange for Virgil's escape, 
but get into the chimpanzee 
cages just in time to discover 
the chimps had the same idea 
and are already bashing 
windows with tire irons, 
leading LO some wacky escape 
and chase scenes. 

It's a commercial movie, 
filled with comic light touches 
and star Broderick, an actor 
with big box-office appeal. 
However,it does a worthy 
examination of the uglier 
aspects of animal research. 

Sweeney, Deryl Caitlyn, Craig 
Green, Regina Byrd Smith, 
Theresa McCarthy, Matthew 
Wright, Monica Buckley, and 
Giovanni Felicioni gave 
notable performances. 

Last season, in her first 
association with UCSD, 
Bogart di rected "1951," a 
story focusing around the 
McCarthy era's "Hollywood 
Inquisi tion ." " 1951" was 
nominated for four San Diego 
Critics Circle awards, and 
Michael Roth , recipient of the 
Best Sound Design award, 
also collaborated on the music 
for "The Dispute." 

Linda Cummiskey provides 
an interesting background for 
the soundtrack, as musical 
director Roth cQmbines her 
live music with previously 
taped contemporary and 

words, not sentences, and if 
the chimps do fly off in a 
plane, they've only spent half 
the movie teaching them to 
fly. The human characteriza-
tions also ring true. Except for 
some minor hokiness at the 

classical medleys. Roth is a 
regular composer for the La 
Jolla Playhouse, a veteran 
since 1983, who has just 

very end, this is a competent 
film. It's a tear-jerker, but the 
concept is novel. With what 1 
think are dogs like "Lethal 
Weapon" in theatres, I have 
no qualms in recommending 
" Projeft X." 

And, at the same time, the 
abilities of chimpanzees are 
not exaggerated. Virgil signs Matthew Broderick, Helen Hunt and Virgil star in "Project X. "
