More Budget Cuts 
Amounced at UCD 
DA VIS - More harsh cutbacks 
herald the implementation of 
the third phase of UCD's 
budget reduction plan. Proposed 
cuts include the elimination of 
the Office of the Vice Chancel-
lor of Facilities; a 100 percent 
reduction in funding for 
intercollegiate athletics that 
may eliminate UCD's athletic 
programs entirely; the dissolu-
tion of the geography depart-
ment and a 49 percent cutback 
in the budget of the Women 's 
Resource and Research Center. 
The overall goal of the plan is 
an 18 percent cut in the 
university 's total budget.

UCSD Researchers Design Bridge 
To 'Revolutionize' Engineering 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

A futuristic bridge, designed by UCSD engi-
neers to spur a "renaissance of civil engineer-
ing," may span the Interstate-5 near the School 
of Medicine within the next four years. 

Under a $ 1.6 million Federal Highway Ad-
ministration grant, UCSD engineers are leading 
a team of researchers looking for ways to use 
military technology in civilian projects. 

According to project director and Professor 
of Engineering Gilbert Hegemier, the bridge 
will be built using military technology materials 
and will serve as an example of how such 
materials can be used. 

"What we' re trying to do is make a quantum 
jump in technology. That's the type of thing that 
doesn't occur by the normal mode of research," 
Hegemier said, emphasizing the need for the 
bridge monument to catalyze a technological 
revolution. 

Hegemier said the conversion of military 
technology is timely, since the cost of materials 
is going down and military contractors are los-
ing federal funding. "[Before] Russia fell off the 
bridge, this technology was not available to the 
community," he said. 

The bridge will prove the value of the new 

technology to the engineering and contracting 
communities, Hegemier added. 

The basic design of the bridge will be similar 
to existing structures, but the materials will be 
unique, weighing one-fifth to one-tenth of con-
ventional bridge materials. The light weight 
will make them much less prone to collapse 
during earthquakes, easier to use and more 
resilient. 

And because such materials can be prefabri-
cated, the new structures may be cheaper than 
conventional structures because they would take 
much less time to build. "The materials are five 
times costlier, but the job is done eight times 
faster," Hegemier said. 

Bridge materials will include composites of 
carbon, glass and kevlar, all or which were used 
in stealth-type aircraft. Use of the materials 
would also extend beyond bridge structure, and 
"could be a new renaissance in civil engineer-
ing," Hegemier said. 

Such a renaissance is the brain-child of 
Hegemier and project co-director Frieder Seible, 
also a UCSD professor of engineering. Hegemier 
said he has 20 years of experience in aerospace 
materials, while Seible is well-known in the 
field of civil engineering.

Architecture 
School May 
Close Down 
EDUCATION: Budget woes force 
Academic Senate Council to 
recommend new school's closure 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer . 

The UCSD School of Architecture will be 
the first University of California department to 
shut its doors because of the state budget cuts if 
a preliminary Academic Senate Council recom-
mendation is followed. 

Although the Senate Council has not made a 
final announcement, an early draft indicates that 
the council will recommend that the graduate 
school be closed because of a budget shortfall. 

Such a recommendation must be approved 
by Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
Marjorie Caserio, Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
and the Board of Regents, and must follow a 
specific disestablishment procedure which has 
not yet been initiated. 

Caserio said she has not seen a final version 
and cannot yet make a decision, but she would 
be influenced by the council's "very strong 
recommendation." She added that no official 
move to disestablish the school has been made. 

Last fall, just a few months after it was 
founded, the fledgling school of architecture 
received notice that its budget would be trimmed 
more than 50 percent to about $600,000. 

Such a cut would have made continuation, 
accreditation and expansion of the school virtu-
ally impossible, according to Associate Profes-
sor of Architecture Dana Cuff. 

Negotiations proceeded, and plans were an-
nounced to putthe school in stasis in a three-year 
budget freeze which would end if the state 
budget improves. In the meantime, only one 
class would graduate, and other students would 
be transferred to UCLA and UC Berkeley. 

According to Academic Senate ChairGeorge 
Backus, the recommendation will probably be 
made for closure because the school would not 
be viable under deep-freeze conditions. 

"The underlying problem is thatthe architec-
ture degree is a focusing degree - it is useful 
[only] if the school is accredited. To be accred-
ited,you have toexpand,andit wasclearthatthe 
school would not be accredited quickly ,"Backus 
said. 

Cuff agreed that the three-year freeze

Students File New Grievance Against Watson 
By Chris Jensen 
Associate News Editor 

In a grievance filed with Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson last week, six 
UCSD tudents accused Vice Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
Watson of violating university policy 
when he "disestablished" the Univer-
sity Center Board (UCB) on Feb. 4. 

According to the Notice of Non-
Academic Grievance sent to 
Atkinson last week, Wat on vio-
lated university bylaws outlined by 
UCSD Policy and Procedures Ap-
plying to Student Activities when 

he did not seek student input in his 
decision to disestablish the UCB 
and create the Vice Chancellor's 
Advisory Board on theStudentCen-
ters to takes its place. 

The grievance was filed by 
former UCB representatives An-
drew Clark, Dan Hurst , Erin 
Hemmings and Steve Dubb, Gradu: 
ate Student A sociation (GSA) 
President Patrick Carroll and gradu-
ate student Diane Burnside. 

Clark aid he igned the griev-
ance because he believe the new 
AdvisOry Board cannot adequately 

represent students in the operation 
of the university centers. 
. "It'sprettyclearthatthey[UCSD 

administrators] don't want students 
to have any say in the way [the 
university centers] are run," he said. 

Watson said the grievance is the 
result of "a few individuals with a 
self-interest to pursue" trying to 
block attempts at student-
adminstration cooperation. 

"[The students] know [thegriev-
ance] has no real value or validity, 
and this a way to keep the issue

Testing of the bridge materials

Instead, much of the materials 
testing is being incorporated into 
ongoing lab projects.

in a four -year period, Hegemiersaid 
he believes the bridge will be con-

"All players are forced to pro-

kind of strategy leads to more than 
research with no goals in mind," he 
said.

Expresso Roma to Expand With New Patio 
ADDI1ION: Consbuction 
will provide larger seating 
area for its customers 
By Terri Duaan 
Guardian Reporter 

Espresso Roma in the Price Cen-
ter will soon offer outdoor seating 
for coffee-sipping students who find 
enclosed spaces confining. 

A new patio area with 60 seats 
will be added to the current struc-
ture, according to University Cen-
ters Director Jim Carruthers. New 
landscaping and seating for the 
nearby campus shuttle stop will also 
be added. 

"I think Roma will be the place 
to be on campus with outdoor seat-
ing," Espresso Roma manager Stuart 
Kraemer said. 

Kraemer said the plans for ex-
pansion have been in the works 
"since the beginning of Rom a more 
than two years ago." The construc-
tion began after the plans were ap-
proved by the UCSD Design Re-

Watson regarding the Spring Election Referenda question number four. The 
question asked students whether they thought that the Office of Student 
Affairs was ' responsive to student needs. · The letter indicated that the 
council will organize a survey which will compile undergraduate's comments 
and criticisms of the Office of Student Affairs. In Council Caucus, the council 
discussed what issues would be addressed by the survey, as well as the

PINION 
COMMENTARIES: THE RODNEY KING VERDICT 

Graphics by Roger Kuo/Guardian 

While Saturday's rerdict was not a complete loss, it certninly was not a 
vicflJry - regardless of the deciswn, things renwin the same in LA. 
By Gaye Johnson 
Staff Writer 

T. S. Eliot said that there is no greater treason than to do the right deed for the wrong reason. Saturday's 
• compromise of a verdict 

was just enough justice to insure the absence 
of an uprising: a clearly middle-of-the-road, 
no give-no take decision. 

Although it was not a complete loss, this 
verdict was cenainly not a victory. 

Countless times I heard on the radio how 
happy everyone was with the outcome. The 
majority of the whites who called in were 
just relieved there wouldn't be unrest, while I 
and many others sat thinking about the 
reason why there wouldn't be. It leaves me 
convinced as to the strategy of the verdict's 
content and release - Saturday morning at 
7:00 a.m. isn't exactly the most social time. It 
undennines the possibility of organized 
reaction because everybody's asleep. Last 
year's verdict was heard fairly simulta-
neously by everyone, because they were at 
work or school; everyone could react at the 
same time. I'll bet Los Angeles won't do that 
again. 

Seven a.m. means you have to wait until 
the world's awake, get everyone together and 
then tell the news. 1be majority of people 
finding out at different times means the 
degree of reaction is different. It divides 
people. 

Another aspect of the verdict itself is 
divisive - the fact that there were two

station and fIIank 
the jury for the 
verdct. I cam't

venIct WM going

convicted and two acquitted. Los Angeles 
was prepared for a landslide victory or a 
landslide loss, and this compromise threw 
everyone for a loop. 

Some people felt that the convictions 
fairly cancelled out the acquittals, and others 
still remain preoccupied with Briseno's and 
Wind's dismissals. Not only did this 
compromise the integrity of the 
prosecution's assertions, it completely 
divided the opinions of everyone who heard 
the verdict. It insured complacency. Another 
point for strategy. One more thing - there 
were more than four police officers standing 
over Rodney King, and there should have 
been more than four standing trial. 

I heard one woman caU in to a radio 
station and thank the jury for the verdict. I 
can't thank them for anything because either 
way the verdict was going to go, things 
remain the same. This won't change 
anything for Los Angeles, not as far as I am 
concerned. Any satisfaction over the verdict 
is tempered by the continuing state of race 
relations and the disparity in opportunity

By Gntgoty Stephens 
Staff Writer 

When I got home Monday night and told my roommate Mark that I had been asked to write about the meanillg of the Solomonic split 
decision in the Rodney King civil rights trial , he 
wanted to know what I was going to say. 

"Well, I'm going to say that I'm glad we 
finally got at least partial justice in this case." I 
told him. "I'm going to say I hope some Afri-
can-Americans will move beyond paranoid theo-
ries of a genocidal conspiracy against them by 
the 'white power structure.' And I'm going to 
say that I hope we can at least move toward the 
day when we judge each other by the same 
standards. " 

"{ don 't know any 
black people," Mark 
confessed. "But I've 
read that many young 
blacks slack off in 
school because aca-
demic achievement is 
viewed as 'acting 
white.' Do you think 
that's true?" 

"Henry Louis 
Gates wrote about 
how a lot ofblackkids 
in D.C. didn'tthink it 
was cool to go to the 
Smithsonian museum 
because their peers 
would accuse them of 
'acting white, .. ' I 
noted. 

"That's screwed 
up," said Mark. 

"It sure is," I 
agreed. It was also 
screwed up, I thought, 
that so many Ameri-
cans still didn't really 
know any black 
people on a personal 
level. One could ar-

lation made the Simi Valley jury verdict pos-
sible, or conversely, made it possible for so 
many blacks to believe all whites thought like 
that jury. 

The stereotyped response would be to blame 
someone like Mark, a white man, for living in a 
homogenous environment. But it's not always 
that simple. Mark. for instance, is far from 
monocultural. He's lived in China for two years 
and is a first-year International Relations and 
Pacific Studies grad student. Is it his fault that 
there are hardly any blacks in his department? 
Ask yourself, homeboy, why is that? Would an 
African-American interested in the Pacific Rim 
be accused of "thinking white?" Or "thinking 
yellow?"

COMMENTARIES: THE RODNEY KING VERIICT 

By clanwringfor rengeonre, tJre sdwning opportuT1istJ who leapt UjXJn tJre King case put real justice in jeqxmly 
By Ben Boychuk 
Senior Staff Writer 

TIle word has been given, the de-
cision reached, the verdict read. The 
trial of the fourlawless lawmen in Los 
Angeles is over at last. 1be City of 
Angels may now resume its daily 
routine with the reasonable assurance 
that the great metropolis of the West 
Coast will not have to bum again - at 
least, not until the Reginald Denny 
case is decided. 

Every politician and civil rights 
bigwig from Compton to Washing-
ton has managed to issue a lofty pro-
nouncement applauding the verdict 
as a "triumph for justice" and one 
more step on the road toward equal-
ity. "Finally,"declaredself-described 
community activist Rose Brown, 
"there isjustice in this country." Never . 
one to miss an opportunity to pontifi-
cate before a television camera, the 
Reverend Jesse Jackson, shedding 
tears of joy, described the outcome as 
"a good verdict," but hastened to add 
that "it makes me weep that we must 
go through aillhis drama to get simple 
justice." 

Simple justice? Obviously, jus-
tice is in the eye of the beholder. All 
such pronouncements are absurd, of 
course. The only justice served this 
week was mob justice - the same 
sort of ugly lynch mob vengeance 
supposedlyabandonedthree-quarters 
of a century ago. A wave of giddiness 
and relief ripples throughout the city 
and the nation, but there is nothing to 
celebrate. 

Held hostage by extortionists and 
thugs, Los Angeles knuckled under. 
What other choice did it have? Like 
an unscrupulous racketeer muscling 
the local merchants for protection 
money, local and national politicians 
and community activists said to cow-
ering Angelenos, 'That's a nice city 
you've got there. Pity if something 

ObvIously, justice Is In the ey. of the beholder. 1he only justice 
served this week was mob Justice - the same sort of ugly lynch 
mob v ......... pposecly abInIoned a.ae qu..t.s of a 
century ago. A wave of gIddI ........ relet ripples tInughout 
the city and the natIor., but there Is nothing to eelelllata. 
happened to it." 

With the terrifying images of a 
city in flames forever burned into the 
mind of anyone who watched televi-
sion or read a newspaper in the days 
of rage following the verdict last April, 
there is some serious doubt as to 
whether a fair trial was even possible, 
much less desired. 

What matters is not the fact that 
the four officers were tried twice-for 
the same crime, or that the evidence 
against the officers was far from con-
clusive, or that the much-ballyhooed 
videotape showed to the general pub-
lic did not give the complete picture. 
What matters, apparently, is that the 
jury got it right this time. 

Rarely are prosecutors given a sec-
ond chance, because of the Fifth 
Amendment's prohibition of double 
jeopardy. So far as I can detennine, 
there is no constitutional provision 
that sanctions double jeopardy in the 
event of a stupid or disagreeable ver-
dict. The language seems plain 
enough: "No person," the long-ne-
glected document states, "shall ... be 
subject for the same offense to be 
twice put injeopardy.oflife or limb." 

But, in a bitter stroke of irony lost 
on all but the most astute libertarians, 
a federal civil rights prosecution is 
treated as a different crime from the 
state offense of assault. Civil rights 
cases arevirtualty impossible to prove, 

except in the most obvious instances. 
since the government is saddled with 
the burden of proving that the accused 
ilitended to violate the victim's civil 
rights. 

Had the officers been wearing 
white sheets during the course of the 
beating, there would have been no 
doubt in anyone's mind thatthey were 
guilty as hell. But the facts in this case 
were far from clear. 

The only difference between the 
late federal case and the state trial last 
year, it would appear, is one of se-
mantics.In the state trial, the prosecu-
tion had to prove that the officers used 
excessive force in arresting King. In 
the federal trial, the prosecution had 

to prove the officers violated King's 
Fifth and 14th Amendment rights by 
using excessive force in arresting him. 
At the heart of both cases was the 
question of whether or not excessive 
force was used. The jury in Simi 
Valley thought not. The jury in Los 
Angeles begged to differ. 

[ suspect the four officers were 
guilty of using excessive forceagainst 
King, but [ cannot say for certain. I 
wasn't on the jury. I didn't see all of 
the evidence or hear the testimony of 
the witnesses. Like most people, I 
saw the videotape countless times, 
but I am not convinced, as the latest 
jury was, that the case begins and 
ends there. 

I suspect, as the defense argued, 
that there is more to that video than 
meets the eye. Moreover,I recognize 
that the footage the world saw was 
only a portion of the whole video. 
What did the news programs omit? 
Only the portions where King is seen 
getting up, lunging forward and ap-
parently resisting arrest. But that, as 
they say, is neither here nor there. 

I shed no tears for Rodney King. I 
shed no tears for Powell , Koon, 
Briseno and Wind. For that matter, I 
would invite the likes of Tom Brad-
ley, Pete Wilson. Maxine Waters, 
Michael Woo, Richard Riordan and 
the litany of rabble rousers and politi-
cal opportunists who have attempted 
to profit from this whole sordid affair 
to go straight to Hell. 

I weep instead for justice - real 
jllSlice, not the bogus vengeancedam-
ored for by the torch-bearing mob. 
They wi\l have their chance again 
soon. when another jury decides the 
fate of the four men accused of doing 
to Reginald Denny what the LAPD 
did to King. 

That jury will also be under the 
gun to "do the right thing." God help 
us if they do. 

Instead of wondering what flJ lin with the tim guilty officers, 1re slwuld worry ahout wlwt flJ fin with society 
By Damen Scranton 
Senior Staff Writer , 
'0 h say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, 0 ' re the land of the 

free and the home of the brave." 
- Theme from Major League 

Baseball 
So you think you live in the land of 

the free and the home of the brave, eh? 
Free like motorist Rodney King and 
brave like Sgt. Stacey Koon of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. Or 
was that free like aquinee 1beodore 1. 
Briseno and brave like witness forthe 
prosecution Rodney King? Well, 
whatever. 

Anyway,. now that the circus has 
packed up and left town for a while 
and the media has turned to the sensa-
tionalistic coverage of inner-city 
schoolchildren and their desperate 
struggle to comprehend the incom-
prehensible, residents of L.A. and 
America the Beautiful have a little bit 
of time to actually think before emo-
tion kicks in again for the Aug. 4 
sentencing and its pre-game festivi-
ties. 

For example, do you think that the 
two guilty and two not-guilty verdicts 
were about rights or politics? Did our 
celebrated judicial system work its 
slow magic once again or was some-
I)ne convicted the moment the world 
laid eyes on that infamous videotape? 

Or what do you think about the 
"show of force" by the LAPD and 

other law enforcement agencies dur-
ing the deliberations? Was it a neces-
sary precaution that was indeed a 
factor in the lack of post-verdict vio-
lence or was it $8 million of unneces-
sary overtime pay to officers who 
were all, in a sense, co-defendants, by 
a city that simply cannot spare the 
money? 

Or what do you think about Sgt. 
Koon, Officer Lawrence M. Powell 
and the foreman of the jury being paid 
thousands of dollars each to appear 
on "Hard Copy" and "A Current Af-
fair?" Is that just the way it works in 
this ideal society of capitalism and 
democracy or is that the most insane 
load of shit you've ever heard? 

There are two basic realities in this 
country - the way things are and the 
way people think things ought to be. 
The first reality - the way things are 
- is what you see when you open 
your eyes. You know about things 
like police brutality, child abuse and 
human beings killing one another -
a lot of things that just don't make too 
much sense. Then there's the way 
people think things ought to be. There 
are about 250 million of those, but if 
I may be so bold as to generalize, most 
of those ideal realities consist of a lot 
offreedorn and liberty, an end to pain 
and hardship, and good weather. 

As you can see. there are some 
major discrepancies between the way 
things are and the way things ought to 
be. Which brings us to our fIrSt big 
problem -according to our laws and 

What people should 
be opening their .yes 
to Is that the way 
thI ..... lnthls 
country ain't 
anywtwe cIo •• to 
"the way they ought 
to ba." 
the way our society works, Sgl. Koon 
and Officer Powell were probably not 
guilty. "I did as I was trained," said 
Koon in a post-verdict interview. "I 
did as I was taught. I did as the LAPD 
wants me to do." But the question of 
whether or not the defendants should 
have been found guilty and the ques-
tion of whether or not they should be 
convicted are two distinctly different 
questions. Based on our laws, the two 
should not have been found guilty. 
But based on our society's ideals and 
concept of democracy, the two slwuld 
have been convicted. 

Many African-American and other 
minority communities in Southern 
California are celebrating the outcome 

of the Rodney King civil rights trial 
because justice has been served and 
the entire incident has opened the 
eyes of millions of Americans in terms 
of simply recognizing racism in both 
law enforcement and society. I con-
tend, however,that while racism and 
prejudice are obviously major con-
cerns in this country, what people 
should be opening their eyes to is that 
the way things are ain't anywhere 
close to "the way they ought to be." 

The general public's relationship 
to law enforcement officials is merely 
one example of our society's disillu-
sionment when it comes to the con-
cept of capitalistic democracy. It is 
not right, to me at least, that Koon and 
Powell received compensation for 
"their stories," but that's just the way 
this society works. And it iSJlot right 
that Rodney King was beaten by these 
police officers but, and I cringe when 
I say it, that'sjust the way this society 
works. You can say what you want 
about the FlI'St Amendment, but that's 
just the way it is when you open your 
eyes and take a look at the real world. 

So the problem becomes, then, 
that this society is not what we nor its 
"founders" envisioned. If no one ever 
violated anyone else's First Amend-
ment rights. then there would be no 
crime and the whole Rodney King 
incident would not have occurred in 
the first place because we, as a soci-
ety, would have no need for law en-
forcement.TIlequestionofwhattodo 
with these officers becomes second-

arytothequestion of what to do about 
these discrepancies between the way 
things are and the way they should be. 

When asked about the verdict, Jane 
Park, a IO-year-old from Hobart El-
ementary School in Koreatown, re-
plied: ''I'm happy now. We don't 
have to suffer anymore." This seems 
to be the consensus of the general 
population. Although individuals are 
aware of continued racism in society, 
Saturday's verdict is seen as some 
sort of a solution to the problem. But 
just as building more freeways does 
nothing to solve the problem of traffic 
and putting people to death does noth-
ing to solve the problem of crime, 
throwing these two cops in jail for six 
months, I 0 years or whatever does 
nothing to answer the problem of 
racism or police brutality in this coun-
try. 

In my opinion, Sgt. Koon and Of-
ficer Powell deserve to be in jail for 
what they did to that human being. 
Anyway. their convictions conve-
niently put to rest the fear of renewed 
riots. But the Aug. 4 sentencing is 
right around the comer, as is the 
Reginald Denny trial, and it seems 
clear to me that the Rodney King 
verdicts will have little or no impact 
on the way things are in this country. 
And that's what I'm worried about 
Forget about the land of the free and 
the home of the brave, what you need 
to worry about are dart A 1M ma-
chinesand drunlc drivers and the green-
house effect and the .. .

CLOSURE: 
Architecture school 
may close due to cuts 
ContInued from page 3 
chitecture, even those graduating, 
are looking to redo the program 
elsewhere, since the degree will be 
worth less once the school closes. 

"We feel a little betrayed, but 
we're here, and our lives have been 
devoted to making this move," 
Reyes said. "Promises that were 
made [to the school and students] 
were not fought for. " 

In addition, the status of the ar-
chitecture faculty is not at all cer-
tain. According to Ubbelonde, even 
tenured faculty could be fired if 
their academic department closes. 

Negotiations thus far have in-
volved the transfer of faculty into 
different departments or other UC 
schools, Ubbelonde said . 

Cuff said architecture faculty 
members are committed to theirstu-

dents, but "you have to be consider-
ing leaving [the school]. Once your 
program doesn't exist, it's hard to 
figure out why you' re here,"she said 

Ubbelonde and Reyes expressed 
disappoinbnent with the way the 
school's case has been presented to 
the committees. Reyes said the 
school had been promised immu-
nity from budget cuts, and commu-
nil}' members willing to raise funds 
were not asked for help. 

Reyes added that the School of 
Architecture had been represented 
by another school before Caserio's 
budget task force and had been al-
lowed no direct input. 

Caserio disagreed, saying that 
she placed faculty members repre-
senting all campus academic divi-
sions on the task force, including 
one representing the Architecture 
and International Relations/pacific 
Studies professional schools. 

Ubbelonde said the authority of 
various councils and the representa-
tion allowed the School of Archi-

The UCSD Guardian 

tecture before those councils is not 
clear. "[We don't know] who makes 
the decisions and with what kind of 
input," she said. 

Faculty and students in architec-
ture expressed disappointment that 
the new school, unusual for its fresh 
ideas and focus on urban and envi-
ronmental architecture, shouldc\ose 
so soon after its establishment. 

"The assemblage of faculty is 
very unusual. It is an assemblage of 
minds rarely found in the school of 
architecture - no one here has ten-
ure, and they're all new thinkers," 
Reyes said. 

Caserio agreed that the situation 
is regrettable. "II's very distressing, 
very upsetting and very sad that we 
even have to discuss this," she said. 

1beschool will remain open until 
a final decision is reached, which 
will probably not be before July 
1994, according to Backus. 

For now, though, "Everything's 
sort of in limbo land," Ubbelonde 
said.

According to Clark, the griev-

Grateful Dead lead 
singer comes to life in 
Sports Arena solo show 

PIIOTO "11'1) STORY BY 
DAII'McDOWEI_ 1. 

SEII'IOR TA1- ~- WRITER 

Within the hazy interior of the San 
Diego Sports Arena, the Jerry Garcia 
Band thrilled thousands of fans Sunday 
night. Garcia, the famed guitarist of the 
Grateful Dead, led his band through 
almost two-and-a-half hours of music in 
the Dead tradition. 

The subculture fonned around Garcia 
ha~ mythical qualities. Stuck in time, it 
gives the '90s a taste of what used to be 
- Volkswagen buses, Birkenstocks, tie-
dye shirts and peace signs all seem 
normal. The atmosphere and music which 
have made the Dead and its loyal follow-
ers a part of American culture have 
remained virtually unchanged in 25 years. 

Although most of the songs the Jerry 
Garcia Band played were not written by 
the band, they were expertly handled and 
characteristically unique. During the 
opening song. James Brown's "How 
Sweet It Is," Garcia gave a wide grin 
which set the tone of the show. Backed by 
organ and keyboard player Melvin Seals, 
bassist John Kahn, drummer David 
Kemper and background vocalists Gloria 
Jones and Jackie LaBranch, Garcia 
delivered a spectacular concert. 

Highlights were TIle Manhattan 's 
"Shining Star," Jesse Stone's "Don't Let 
Go" and "~I," the only song written by 
Garcia. Guitar solos brought each song to

King Missile challenges

college radio hit 

'Detachable Penis' 
JEFF NIES£L 

HIATUS £DITOR 

E arly in the year, King Missile's "Detachable Pe-nis"and DenisLeary's'Tm 
an Asshole" were two of 

the most popular son~s on 
alternative radio stations. Was this a 
sign that American taste 

the way they play the music and the 
repetitiveness. Right now, I get the 
feeling that people don' t want to 
hearthe same songs over and over on 
the radio. It really irritates them." 

King Missile's latest release, 
Happy Hour, mixes 

in music had sunk to 
vulgarity? For King

Penis" concerns a man 
who loses his removable organ and 
searches for it until he finds it in the 
hands of a street vendor. Hall said 
that he tends to come up with his 
lyrics in a stream-of-consciousness 
fashion, writing rapidly with little 
editing, a technique he hopes distin-
guishes King Missile from predict-
able mainstream artists. 

King Missile will play with Hammerbox at the Pub on Sunday at 8 p.m. 

"My distaste for commercial ra-
dio is becoming less and less of a 
secret. I think ultimately that the 
successful radio stations of the mid-
to late '90s will be ones with much 
more creative formats than the ones 
we have going on today," Hall said 
during a recent phone interview. "A 
lot of radio stations are losing their 
aUdiences, andl think it's because of

ing songs and making things rhyme 
and fit into a strict meter - it's 
never been my forte and I rarely 
attempt it." 

still doesn't employ a speci fic tech-
nique or process when writing. 

Theemphasis on the spoken word 
on Happy Hour relates to Hall's 
feelings about poetry and the resur-
gent popularity of poetry readings 
and spoken-word recordings. Hall , 
who is also a perfonnance artist, 
feels that performance art will con-
tinue to grow in popularity because 
of the way it brings language to life. 

"Another reason I 'm happy about 
the spoken word resurgence is my 
attraction toward being recorded as 
opposed to being published," he said. 
"I feel that poetry on the page is kind 
of dead for me compared to poetry 
heard live or read aloud. 

.. A lot of songs strike me as really 
contrived and not based in any emo-
tion," Hall said. "I've never been 
interested in craftsmanship. 

Hall, who graduated with degrees 
in film and communication from 
Queens College in New York, said 
that his education didn ' t help his 
writing much. He took a summer 
poetry class at Cornell but said he 

"I think a lot of poetry is written 
to be read, not heard - and you can 
tell the difference. 'A-wop-bop-a-

CantInued from PIP HI 
an entirely new level. 

Garcia used both his vocals and 
guitar to emphasize the plea in Bob 
Dylan's "I Shall Be Released."Each 
word he sang and each note he 
played complemented the other 
impeccably. 1beernotional cry was 
felt throughout the arena. 

Louis Annstrong's "What a 
Wonderful World" retained its origi-
nal somber effect. Pleasant vocals 
and Garcia's drifting guitar gave it 
an almost dreamy feel. 

The fast-paced "Moonlight at 
Midnight" ended the show, leaving 
fans captivated and wanting more 
from Garcia. Chants and cheers 
filled the arena, and as the lights 
went on fans slowly filed out, let-
ting the near-religious experience 
soak in. Before walking off stage, 
Garcia said, "Hope to see you all 
later." No doubt many in the audi-
ence will be wherever he plays next. 

Both before and after the show, 
the parking lot was filled with ven-
dors attempting to sell tie-dyed 
shirts , vegetarian meals, beads and 
other handcrafted odds and ends in 
regular Grateful Dead fashion. 
Many were part of the caravan that 
follows the Grateful Dead and 
Garcia across the nation. 

For many people, Garciaand the 
Grateful Dead are words that can 
only be muttered with distaste, but 
both have something unique to of-
fer. The music and the subculture is 
not for everyone, but the feeling of 
being part of Garcia's music goes 
deeper than buying an album. It 's 
an attachment to a set of ideas that 
are perhaps outdated by modem 
standards. But doesn ' t everyone 
need to escape reality once in a 
while? 

KING: Black 
humor dominates 
ContInued from pap H3 
loo-bop'. , . SteveAllen used to make 
fun of it, but it has more resonance 
than your average Robert Frost 
poem. Whereas Ginsberg, who was 
made fun of for using silly sounds 
and cursing and talking about drugs 
and politics [in] the way he wrote 
verse - I feel he is our greatest 
American poet living." 

Hall may not be a great poet 
himself, but Happy Hour is charac-
terized by its sense of adventure and 
heavy doses of black humor. On the 
song "Martin Scorcese," the band 
pays tribute to the famed film direc-
tor by adopting the aggressive style 
of many ofhis characters: "He makes 
the best fucking films. If! ever meet 
him/l'm going to grab his fucking 
neck and just shake him/and say 
thank you for making such excel-
lent fucking movies." 

Some listeners might fi nd Hall's 
dead-pan delivery and sordid themes 
silly or even offensive. Complaints 
can be registered on a computer 
bulletin board dedicated to King 
Missile on the Prodigy Network. 
The band doesn' t mind criticism 
and might just find the complaint 
funny enough to publish. 

"Some guy ragged on us in the 
Prodigy NetWOrk, and we printed it 
on the back of one of our shirts 
because we thought it was so funny." 
Hall said

STEPHENS: 
There is hope to be 
found in the verdict 
ContInued from pa&e 4 

I wonder how long it will be be-
fore an African-American can be-
come an expert in Asian affairs with-
out anracting special anention. After 
all, nobody makes much of white 
guys like Mark. who become "China 
hands." Some would contest my right 
to write about Latin American or Afro-
Caribbean culture, but no one has 
ever accused me of trying to "think 
black" or "think brown." 

To be honest, the sense of isola-
tion that I constantly hear my black 
peers express grieves me. On the one 
hand, I think it is admirable when they 
repeatedly express their des ire to "up-
lift the race" or "help my people." On 
the other hand, I think it is tragic that 
so many have been convinced that the 
world is against them; that they are 
given Iinle incentive to develop a 
sense of "my people" that includes, 
but is not limited to, "blackness." 

I think about South African novel-
ist Alan Paton 's prophecy in C,y, the 
Belol'ed COllntry, that "When whites 
finally tum to loving, blacks will have 
already turned to hating." Are we 
condemned to a similar fate? Will we 
one day be another Yugoslavia? 

It is too much to hope that one 
guilty verdict in a police brutality trial 
will restore a sense of trust in the 
criminal justice system. It is too much 
to hope that this isolated incident will 
convince blacks that in fact most 
Americans wantthem to succeed: that 
we realize that the talents and contri-
butions of our black citizens are es-
sential if we are to succeed in tht: 
long-delayed project of building a 
multiracial democracy. 

It should not be too much to hope 
that this verdict symbolizes the deter-
mination of the vast majority of our 
society to fight against racism and 
bigotry of all types. It is perhaps not 
too much to hope that this symbol, 
repeated often enough, will inspire an 
ethic of mutual respect and a realiza-
tion that our racial obsession is blind-
ing us to much deeper and deadlier 
problems. 

It 's been a rough two years for 
race relations since the King video 
flfSt aired in March 1991. The acquit-
tals in the first King trial and subse-
quent riots seemed to confinn our 
worst stereotypes about each other. 
That white people were all racists, 
controlled the "system" and would 
never give blacks an even shake. That 
black people were prone to violence 
and unwilling to take responsibility 
for their own actions. 

In fact, opinion polls after the first 

Think lbu Can Do a aetter Job? 

The UCSD Guardian 

King trial showed that 80 percent of 
white and Latino Califomians thought 
the officers should have been con-
victed. Polls showed most whites were 
willing to pay higher taxes to help 
heal African-Americans and other 
groups who have suffered historical 
discrimination. Polls show that most 
African-Americans are socially con-
servative, hard-working members of 
or aspirants to the middle class. The 
vast majority of black people in South 
Central Los Angeles did not partici-
pate in the burning, looting and vio-
lence against whites and Koreans. 

But with a mass media mainline, 
we live in a hall of mirrors in which 
rumors quickly become "fact" and 
images of our "enemies" are multi-
plied out of proportion to their actual 
numbers. 

It has become fashionable to be 
pessimistic, to prove one's lack of 
naivete by joining in with the chorus 
of cynics singing that old song about 
how blacks will never be equal in this 
society. That fashion is a self-fulfill-
ing prophecy that I'm not going to 
follow. 

My personal point of view is, 
things have gotten both better and 
worse. We can choose to fight the 
worse or encourage the better. It's not 
an either/or situation, but as for me, 
I'm tired of fighting. Whenever you 're 
ready, I'll be around.

JOHNSON: 
People are settling 
into complacency 
ContInued from pace 4 
town?" Go see the overwhelming 
sense of uselessness in grown men 
and women caused by being bound to 
nowhere jobs, nowhere neighbor-
hoods, nowhere lives. Life has little 
meaning if you don't feel like you are 
capable of providing for your family. 
Feeling like you have absolutely noth-
ing in life gives you absolutely noth-
ing to lose, and only respect to gain. 
Like rapper Ice Cube says, "To get 
some respect, we had to tear this 
motherfucker up ... " 

Instead of beUer education, better 
jobs and increased life chances, Pete 
Wilson and Willie Williams sent 700 
members of the National Guard, 3000 
LAPD officers, 1350 Los Angeles 
County sheriffs deputies and 1500 
Califomia Highway Patrol Officers 
to L.A. All in the name of peace. 

The money it took to send in the 
extra patrols and the National Guard 
could have been used for schools, 
daycare programs, neighborhood re-
sources, all kinds of things which 
would have decreased the potential of 
intensity of last year's uprising fol-
lowing the verdict. 

The absence of an uprising this 
year in the face of the acquittal of 
Briseno and Wind is a telling com-
mentary on the state of our minds 
today. That we would have nothing to 
say about these two - in any way -
is just plain sorry. In the Simi Valley 
trial, Briseno maintained that he was 
King' s defender and stepped on the 
back of his head only to keep him 
from geUing up and being struck again. 
Anyway. 

People are settling into a loose and 
comfortable definition offreedom and 

OPINION 9 

a thoughtless assumption that every-
one has access to this freedom. Sil-
ting back means we are comfortable 
with the fallacy ofthis being a "free" 
country. 

Making waves about bureaucratic 
indiscrepancies is a thought that oc-
curs to you less and less frequently 
when your own upward mobility, and 
therefore your family's well-being, is 
well protected as a civil institution. 
This says that if everyone would just 
cooperate, concern themselves with 
their own success, we could all get 
along just fine. Nice for the massive 
middle class, but not for those who do 
not have access to these life chances. 
The effects of the crisis, especially on 
black youth , would indicate other-
wise. 

We cannot afford to be 0 compla-
cent when there are 50 many who are 
oppressed. Not only is it di respectful 
to those who are left to suffer, it is 
dangerous for us to believe that ev-
eryone counts. Martin Luther King's 
assertion thaI there is nothing more 
dangerous than conscientious stupid-
ity and sincere ignorance is particu-
larly applicable here. 

Many are seeing this reality with 
their own eyes and are glancing right 
over it, like L.A.' s own Police Chief 
Williams - "I think the men and 
women of L.A. should go about their 
daily lives," he said. "Gotoschool,go 
to the movies, go shopping, get in the 
pool, do whatever they had planned to 
do ... go about their daily lives and 
enjoy it." 

Make no mistake - Saturday's 
verdict was not a victory, because it 
says nothing about the human condi-
tion of the oppressed. It does nothing 
but give us a pacifier. Despite the two 
convictions, I agree with many others 
who see right through this into the 
ugliness of this excuse for a resolu-
tion: there is no justice, just us.

Victory Somewhere Over The Rainbow For Tritons 
.N'llIULLEYBALI.: UCSD lo;es to Hawaii twice 
By BIIIIr RIdley 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD volley-
ball team took in a piece 
of paradise, traveling to 
Hawaii for a pair of 
matches last weekend. 

Friday night, in front 
of a crowd of 875, the 
host Rainbows out-
slugged the Tritons in 
four hard-fought games, 
15-11, 15-4, 13-15, 15-
10. 

UCSD led or matched Hawaii in 
just about every statistical category, 
except for errors. In the four games, 
the Tritons had 38 errors while the 
Rainbows had only 24. 

Other than errors, the main factor 

in UCSD'sdefeat was their 
hitting percentage. Al-
though they posted a solid 
.264, they could not shut 
down the powerful Rain-
bow offense which hit .426 
for the match. 

The visiting Tritons had 
five players with double-
digit kills. Steve Kremser 
had a game-high 22 kills. 
Mitchell Yap was second 
on the squad with 20. 

Tyson Kerr chipped in 
14 of his own, while Neal O'Brien 
and Matt Minehan each added II to 
the UCSD cause. 

On Saturday night, the Rainbows 
once again outlasted the Tritons, this 
time in three games, 15-13, 15-9,16-
14. 

-

Unfortunately for UCSD, this 
match was more of the same continu-
ing to post impressive numbers but 
could not put together three outstand-
ing games. 

Kremser once again led the Tri-
ton charge with a game-high 30 
kills . 

The Tritons hit an impressive.304 
in the match, but still could not sur-
mount the Rainbow offense, which 
once again hit over .400, at .427. 

It was the second match of the 
season in which UCSD hit over .300. 

Once again, errors were one of the 
deciding factors, as Hawaii commit-
tedjust 15, where UCSD made 31. 

Other standouts for the Tritons in 
the second match included O'Brien, 
who had 13 kills and nine digs, and 
Minehan, who added II kills and 
three digs. 

Jason Rltchle/GuanfMl 
Steve Kremser (8) had 52 kills last weekend In HawaII. 
dropped UCSD's record to 2-23 on 
the season and 1-16 in Mountain Pa-
cific Sports Federation matches. 

The two losses on the weekend The Tritons will round out the 

season with two matches this week-
end in the Bay Area against Stanford 
University and the University of the 
Pacific.

• N'S lENNIS: UCSD, ranked 13th in preseason polls, has 
zoomed to nwnber seven and is positioned for Nationals berth 
By Art Root 
Associate Sports Editor 

Heading into the 1992-93 season, ex-
pectations were lower than usual for the 
UCSD men's tennis team. Ranked 13th in 
the preseason Division ill polls, the Tritons 
were an unknown corrunodity. Could a 
team of young, inexperienced starters push 
the club into the national championship 
picture? With Nationals less than a month 
away, the answer is a resounding yes. 

The red-hot Tritons, riding 
a three-match winning streak, 
have zoomed to seventh in the 
latest Divison ill poll. Such a 
lofty ranking has impressed and 
silenced the critics. 

'This year we had some-
thing to prove. With such a 
young tearn, the guys have re-
ally come together. When one 
guy has been down, others have 
picked him up. It's been a tre-
mendous team effort," said 
UCSD Head Coach Tim 
Ditzler. 

The Tritons' steady improvement 
throughout the season has not gone unno-
ticed by Ditzler. "Earlier in the season, our 
doubles played great but our singles were 
down. By miciseason, our singles started 
dominating but our doubles suffered. Now, 
both singles and doubles are playing really 
well," he said 

UCSD (8-6) is peaking at the right time. 

(Texas) have positioned UCSD for one of 
the four at-large berths in the 12-team 
championship field ,; The committee tries 
to take the 12 strongest teams, and with the 
number-seven ranking, we're in great 
shape:' Ditzler said. 

John Cross has anchored UCSD's 
steady singles play, winning 10 of 12 
matches at the number-two position. "He's 
a real team player, one of those players that 
leads by example. He's been a big, driving 
force to our success," Ditzler said. 

Number-five singles player Roy 
Gessford has been another tandout 

player forthe Tritons. ';He' s got a 
huge serve-and-volley game, and 
when he's on, Roy is the toughest 
number five in the country," 
Ditzler said. 

Sophomore Robbie Ho, play-
ing at number-four singles, has 
made his presence known on and 
off the court, according to Ditzler. 
"Robbie is a hard worker who 
dictates the attitude of practice. 
He's a real banler who's playing 
some of the best telUlis on the 

tearn," the coach said. 
After a midseason slump. UCSD's 

doubles play has improved dramatically. 
The number-two team ofYamell and Brian 
Kaplan continues to be the key to the 
Tritons' doubles success. "Kaplan is one of 
the most valuable players on the team. He 
keeps the team loose but poised. We 
wouldn't have gotten this far without him." 
Ditzler said. 

Number~e singles player Jeff Bethard has also been a force In doubles for UCSD this season. 

With its number-seven national ranking, the 
Tritons are all but assured of a berth in the 
Division ill National Championships held 
in Kalamazoo, Michigan next month. Re-
cent victories in Phoenix against Division ill 
powers Gustavus Adolphus and Trinity 

Rounding out UCSD's doubles lineup 
is the team of Ho and Gessford The lefty-
rightytandem is undefeated in threematches 
and amongthetoughest number-three teams 
in the country, according to Ditzler. 

So it's come to 
this. 

Now we don't mean to 
complain, but you just 
haven't responded. We 
asked for writers, and we 
haven't gotten any. Now 
we're mad, and you won't 
like us when we're mad. So 
do yourself a favor and call 
534-6582 and write for the 
sports section. 
Otherwise .. . we know 
where you live. 

BASEBALL: 
UCSD picks up 
another big win 
Continued from page 14 

ing the leadoff runner, UCSD did 
what it has done almost to perfec-
tion lately - drive in the big run 
with two outs. 

Hart drew a walk, which brought 
Birk to the plate. Birk sent a high 
chopper over the first baseman's 
head, and Miyake raced home with 
the winning run. Birk (3-4, 2 RBI, 
.301) had three of the six Triton hits 
off of Swan (1-8). 

"It's nice to' get some big hits 

when maybe our big guys were hav-
ing a rough day," said Birk. 

Luhrsen (5-3) went the distance 
for his third complete game, turn-
ing in a perfonnance Yates cited as 
"tremendous." Luhrsen has consis-
tently taken the team deep into the 
eighth or ninth , and leads the team 
in innings pitched. 

"J think the team has become 
more confident with me out there, 
and I'm just lucky my ann lets me 
go out there and go the distance," 
said Luhrsen. 

Added Yates, "We were out of 
synch on offense. It wasn't a physi-
cal thing, we just weren't ready 
mentally. l\'sjusta big win for us." 

JOE 
ContInued from page 14 
prison. Actually. scratch that. If the 
average 4ger fan has his way, the 
top brass of the 4gers will be in 
prison very soon. If I were one of 
them, I'd go willingly; it might be 
the safest place in the city for them. 

But even now that the deed is 
done, it's still unimaginable seeing 
Joe Montana walking onto the field 
in a Kansas City Chiefs uniform. 
Ugh, it gives you the same kind of 
feeling you get from eating bad 
shellfish. 

I know everybody who isn't from 
the Bay Area is sick of hearing all of 

us Niner fans whine and cry and 
look frantically around for the Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse and 
the fire and brimstone. But you 
know what? I don 't care. 

So anyway, now that you know 
I'm not going to write about the Joe 
situation, I'll tell you what I'm go-
ing to write about. Bass fishing. 
Fishing for bass, as they say down 
south. Just you and the fish. Getting 
back to nature. Yes sir, there's noth-
ing like bass fishing to escape the 
pressure of everyday life like, uh, 
well, like, oh screw it. I'll bet Joe 
goes bass fishing , catches dozens of 
huge bass and then fries them up 
himself to give to the homeless.

The Majlman Delivers 
GOLF: UCSD wins tourney; Moe selected as member for USA-Japan matches 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Sports Editor 

It would be tough to slow down 
the UCSD golf team at this point. A 
thermonuclear explosion at close 
range might do it, but anything el e 
wou lq be about as effective as try-
ing to nail a 17-foot putt with a 
length of hose. 

The Tritons romped through a 
field of 10 teams at Monday's Point 
Lorna Invitational, finishing in a 
new school record for a two-round 
tourney, a one-over-par 573. That 
was 14 strokes beller than runner-
up USD and only two off from the 
tournament record . "Our score was 
lower than low," UCSD Head Coach 
Mike Wydra said. " it was a 15-
stroke improvement over last year. 
which is just unbelievable." 

Leading the charge was "The 
Mailman," sophomore Pete Rob-
erts. who shot a one-over 72 in the 
morning at the easier Monte Vista 
course before dropping jaws all 
through the gallery with an eye-
popping three-under-par 69 at the 
very difficult, 6,905-yard Ivanhoe 
course in the afternoon. 

Roberts was one under as he 
came to the 16th hole, where he 
smashed a 31 O-yard drive to help 
him birdie the par-four hole. 

The Triton seemed to hit a major 
snag on the 17th when he plopped 
one in lhe water. After taking the 
penalty, Roberts hit the ball to within 
65 feet from the pin, a few feet off 
the green. The sophomore then 
dropped it in the hole from 65 feet 
out, essentially eagling the hole for 
a birdie because of the penalty. He 
parred the fi nal hole and finished 
the round at three-under. His two-
round total of 141 gave him first 
place overal I. 

UCSD picked up second place 
as well with Brock Shafer finishing 
tied with USD's Matt Bryant at 142 
after the two rounds. Shafer and 
Bryant faced off in a playoff where 
Shafer "surgically nailed par on the 
first hole , thereby dispatching 
[Bryant)." 

Tom Brown was the fourth place 
finisher overall at 143, giving the 
Tritons three finishers in the top 
four. Brown had recorded the low-

well, but the youg guy stepped up "They had never elected a West

Nota Word 
About Joe 

If you're reading this in hopes 
that I'll start ranting and raving 
about the whole Joe Montana 
fiasco, you 're out of luck. Nope, 
not one word about Joe. 

Sorry, I've got nothing to say. 
Doesn't matter that I grew up in the 
Bay Area and have been a 4ger fan 
since they were bad. Really, really 
bad. Never mind the fact that some 
idiot on Mighty 690 said about the 
Joe situation that "Those who 
forget the past are doomed to 
repeat it." What the hell is that all 
about? First of all, I don ' t think 
Churchill had football in mind 
when he uttered those famous 
words. And more importantly, four 
Super Bowls is not a bad past to 
repeat. 

I have no comment about the 
fact that it would be a dream come 
true for Montana to lead the Chiefs 
to the Super Bowl next year, a 
stunning 35-17 triumph over the 
Niners. No, I won't say a word. 

And I certainly won't complain 
that the only trade that even comes 
close to comparing to this one 
lately is the Gretzky to the Kings 
for the city of Pasadena and half of 
Fort Knox. But Gretzky was still in 
his prime and hadn't attained the 
legendary stature of a certain 
quarterback so good they named a 
state after him. John Unitas ended 
up leaving Baltimore and playing 
for the Chargers, so there certainly 
is a precedent for megastar 
quarterbacks ending their careers 
with the indignity of playing for 
lousy teams. 

Not that the Chiefs are lousy. 
It's just that "Montana to Emile 
Harry, touchdown!" just doesn't 
have the same ring as Montana to 
Rice or Montana to Taylor or 
Montana to Brent Jones or even 
Montana to Mike Sherrard. Emile 
Harry? Please. Might as w~1I be 
Deborah Harry or Harry Belafonte. 

There won't be a peep from me 
about the fact that in the Bay Area 
on Monday the banner headline of 
the Sail Francisco Examiner was 
"Joe Says No To Niners." Below 
that in smaller type was "the siege 
ends in Waco' story. And I 
wouldn't dream of talking about 
the fact that another Bay Area 
newspaper ran a survey a couple of 
years ago revealing that more 
people could identify Joe Montana 
than George Bush. The man wasn ' t 
just a quarterback, he was the 
Golden Gate bridge, cable cars, 
sourdough bread and Fisherman's 
Wharf rolled in one. Most 4ger fans 
believe that the team came into 
being with the arrival of Joe from 
Notre Dame in 1979. As far as I 
know it did. 

Talk about public relations bombs. 
If there is a Ie s popular group of 
individuals than the 4gers top brass 
in the Bay Area right now, they're in

UCSD Takes Clutch Win 
BMfBAII. Bilk gives Tritons 3-2 
win with clutch hit in eighth inning 
By Jeff Praught 
Staff Writer 

There wasn '( much hitting in Monday 's game 
against La Verne, but when the UCSD Tritons 
needed the big one, freshman Craig Birk came 
through. Birk's two-out base hit scored sopho-
more Chris Miyake, who was the winning run in 
UCSD's 3-2 trium'ph. 

The big matchup between La Verne and 
UCSD, both vying for the final playoff selec-
tion, featured Tyronne Swan for the Cougars and 
Kurt Luhrsen for UCSD. 

The Tritons broke a scoreless duel in the 
fourth by scratching out a run. Miyake led off 
with a walk. Slugger Dan O'Brien, coming into 
the game on a tear with a .704 slugging average 
since joining the team over spring break, sent a 
hit-and-run grounder to third base. O'Brien was 
thrown out at first, but Miyake, displaying the 
aggressiveness UCSD has shown all year, kept 
right on running and was safe at third. 

"I was at second when the third baseman 
fielded the ball, and I just anticipated him throw-
ing across to first. [In warmups] I noticed the 
first baseman didn 't have a great arm, so I just 
took it," said Miyake. 

It turned ollt to be the biggest play of the 
game, as Miyake scored on a Marcos Magdaleno 
groundout. 

The Cougars quickly took the lead in the top 
of the fifth , when Jeff Eckler rolled a triple just 
inside the right field line, scoring Darren Murphy 
with two outs, George Jones then hit a slow 
roller to third and 0' Brien, ensing his only play

was at home, threw wide to the plate, allowing 
Eckler to score, and giv'ing La Verne a 2-1 lead. 

UCSD tied it up in the sixth taking advantage 
of walks to Miyake and Pat Hart to drive in the 
tying run, O'Brien forced Miyake at second, but 
after Hart 's walk, he came around to score on 
Birk's two-out base hit. 

Luhrsen wouldn't let La Verne get to him 
again, shutting it down without a hit the rest of 
the way. 

The stage was set for Birk's game-winning 
hit in the bottom of the eighth off Swan, when 
Miyake led off the inning with a double to left. 
O' Brien then popped out, and Marcos 
Magdaleno grounded out. But instead of wast-'
