to write a letter much like his 
father's and to send the letter to 
the Chancellor, a source said . 

"My acts were encouraged by 
members of the staff and 
students," Cooper said. 

Cooper refused to confirm or 
deny whether Solis was one of 
the staff members who 
encouraged him. 

A source who wished to be 
unidentified said , "I can tell you 
right now that Provost Solis went 
to the students who were in 

conflict with Dean Varga and 
told them to write letters of 
disapproval concerning Varga's 
relationship with them. 

"She also encouraged them to 
have their parents write letters 
along the same lines," the source 
said.

UC tentatively 
OKs fee hike 

A tentative plan raising 
student fees next year by 9.1 
percent generating $16.1 million 
in additional revenue for the 

. University of California was 
approved Friday, ovember 21 , 
by the UC Board of Regents. The 
plan. which would go into effect 

. in the fall of 1986, is subject to 
overall state budgetary decisions 
by the Legislature and the 
governor. 

As a result of California's 
policies, UCs fees have 
remained well below that of 
other comparable institutions 
around the country. This year, 
UC undergraduates paid $1,343 
compared to an averge $1,868 
charged by similar public 
universities in other states. 
Graduate students paid $1 ,385, 
compared to an average $2,221. 

The proposed 9.1 percent hike 
would bring the average annual 
student fee at UC to $1,375 for 
state residents. A 5 percent hike 
in non-resident tuition would 
raise charges for out-of-state 
students to $4,290. Those 
students pay in-state fees as well , 
thus bringing their proposed 
tOtal to $5 ,665 - considerably 
above the average elsewhere .

Fonner Berkeley 
professor jailed 

On Oc tober 27, joseph Royce, 
a former Associate Professor al 
UC Berkeley, was found guilty of 
21 charges of child molestation . 
Royce, who taught physical 
education at Berkele y, was 
sentenced to 10 years in state 
prison and $10 ,000 in fines by 
Aladmeda County Superior Court 
judge Larry ]. Goodman. 

Royce , 62 , resigned his 
position at Berkeley after his 
daughters filed a $20 million 
lawsuit against him and the 
University of California. The suit 
charged that Royce forced the 
twins to pose for pornographic 
piCTUres, which he developed in 
a university darkroom and then 
sold throughout the world. 

The sentence was the result of 
negotiation between the district 
attorney's office and Royce's 
lawyer, Lincoln Mintz. The judge 
dented probation to Royce , citing 
his potential for molesting other 
children and his lack of remorse.

Expanding the 
General Bookstore 
By JULIE RANDAll. 

I N an attempt to accomodate the immediate needs of students , faculty, and others in the UCSD community, the General Bookstore has again remodeled , this time, however, the 
remodeling was begun within two years of moving into its new 
facility which is scheduled to be completed in July 1988. 

Approximately $150,000 was spent on the project, which added 
seven cash registers, increased title selections, and expanded retail 
sales space. Fifty-eight thousand dollars was invested in fixtures. 
The remaining money went to an outside contractor, a fixture 
installer, and a computer system designer. 

According to Paul Mares, general manager of the bookstore, 60 to 
70 percent of the cost incurred in this remodeling will also be 
invested in the new bookstore; the removal of walls, the installment 
of flooring, and the new paint job are, foreseeably, the only changes 
that will not be incorporated into the new faCility . 

The decision to remodel, made by Paul Mares and his 
administrators, was prompted by three major considerations 
concerning students and the UCSD community. With the 
tremendous increase of enrollment expec~ed in the next two years, 
it was perceived that the bookstore would not have the capacity to 
carry enough books or to provide adequate access to them. 

Faculty from the Literature Department, as well as professors like 
Dr. Richie , of the History Department, constantly voiced the 
immediate need for an increased number of titles, because local 
bookstores sell mainly popular, money-making titles. 

Customers' attitudes about shopping in a more desirable-looking 
store were also considered . 

According to Mares, ·We wanted to make shopping at the 
bookstore a pleasure, not a chore." 

In order to provide the extra room needed to expand the store's 
selling space, major storage area in the store was eliminated. 
Storage, shipping, and receiving is currently conducted at a 
warehouse, which costs about $50,000 to rent per year. 
. Now provided with adequate space, the book selection ha5 

increased by 10,000 titles. To aid in supervising the additional 
titles, a computer system was devised, which , it is hoped, will help 
determine the immediate StaTUS of a book in stock or in publication. 

The development of a computer data system and the selection of 
new titles were ideas conceived of by experts from the Stanford 
bookstore, who interviewed UCSD faculty members about their 
needs and drew information from Stanford 's recorded sales history. 

The premise of building a new organizational system, aside from 
proViding faster service and expandi ng the bookstore's ability to 
give .information about available publications, is t~at it will be 
famlhar and effective when the new bookstore , With Its capacity to 
carry a greater amount of merchandise, is completed in 1988. 1LiJ

Andalcio case sheds light on firing 
By MATIHEW J. CRONIN. Opinions Editor 

AN Academic Senate Guardian that the dismissal Majority Report that was papers sent to her cited her released to the Guardian handling of the Andalcio case as 
has shed new evidence upon the "one of the major reasons" why 
recent allegation that the she was terminated. 
termination of Third College 
Dean Beverly Varga is potentially 
linked to her handling of the 
Russell Andalcio "lynching" case 
last February. 

The Academic Senate 
conducted an investigation of 
the University's handling of the 
case at the request of Dr. Peter 
Irons, professor of political 
science at UCSD. 

The Academic Senate MajOlity 
Report (ASMR) is critical of the 
administrative handling of the 
case and raises questions as to 
whether Dean Varga's dismissal 
of aU charges leveled against 
Andalcio contributed to her 
termination eight months later. 
One administrative source said , 
"Dean Varga definitely broke 
ranks with the administration 
during that case." 

An anonymous source close to 
t.he Third College Administration 
claims tht Dean Varga is now 
"paying the price for being the 
only person with the integrity to 
stand-up to the administration 

, and tell them that the charges 
against Russell were 
inappropriate and should have 
never been brought to her desk; 
her termination was wrought out 
of vindictiveness." 

Varga herself has told the 

The UCSD administration and 
Third College Provost Faustina 
Solis have refused to comment 
on the case; however, an 
administrative official , who did 
not want to be identified , said in 
reference to the Varga 
termination, "II wOllld not be out 
of place for supervisors to look at 
a visible , major incident (such 
as the Andalcio case) and . 
evaluate an employee's job 

Popular political activist Andalcio was 
charged with '1ynching" by the UCSD 
police.

performance and loyalty to 
procedure." 

On February 5,1986, Third 
College senior and popular 
political activist Russell Andalcio 
was informed by Beverly Varga 
that he was being charged under 
the campus disciplinary system 
with various offenses. This 
stemmed from an incident that 
occurred on the Hump on 
January 23, 1986, just following a 
speech given by South African 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 
the gym. 

Andalcio had been part o f a 
large crowd of pro-divestment 
activists who were vocally 
challenging the pro-apartheid 
preaching of Campus Evangelist 
Jed Smock, who at the time was 
baiting the activists . A scuffle 
broke out between "Brother Jed" 
and an unidentified person who 
was anempti ng to take the 
preacher's signs away from him. 
Four policemen arrived at the 
scene and attempted to arrest 
the unidentified man. However, 

"" they were discouraged by the 
6 crowd who began to chant , "Let i him go." The police released the 
_ vandal , but later two officers 

~ (Blakeny and Hill) wrote out 
reports which singled our 
Andalcio as the leader of the 
crowd . 

Andalcio was c harged with 
one California Penal Code 
violation: Section 404(a) -
lynching. Accordi ng to the ASMR, 

"lynching" is what Student 
Conduct Coordinator Nick 
Aguilar "chose to define as 
'prompting others to assault the 
University police officers: and 
two other student code 
violations: 'participation in a 
disturbance of the peace on 
UniverSity property: and 'failure 
to comply with the directions of 
a University official in the 
performance of their duty.'" 

These accusations were sent to 
Dean Varga by Aguilar, who 
based the charge sheet on the 
twO police re ports that were 
submitted to him. 

This procedure is part of the 
UCSD diversionary progam 
which intends to avoid crimi nal 
prosecution of students for petty 
crimes which are likely to have a 
different meaningat the University 
than on the streets. It is unusual 
that a crime of this magnitude 
would be sent through this 
program - lynching is a crime 
punishable by not more than 20 
years in a state penitentiary -
but the procedures governing the 
diversionary program do nO( 
appear in writte n form , and 
according to Mr. Aguilar, consist 
of a series of informal 
understandings between himself, 
Police Chief John Anderson, Vice 
Chancellor Watson , and the 
college deans. 

Aguilar says that the reason for 
this is that "each case is 
different, and no standard 

criteria could cover all the 
complexities of each case that 
could be brought before us." 

On February 19, 1986, Russell 
Andalcio was informed that, as a 
result of Dean Varga's 
invesligation into the alleged 
violations which yielded no 
evidence to support the police 
officer's claims, that the 
University had decided to drop 
all charges against him. 

According to Andalcio's 
advisor at the time, attorney 
Peter Irons, Dean Varga "was 
apparently appalled that the

The Great Communicator stammers away 
By MATI SMILEY 

I believe it was the first time I ever felt sorry for the Great Communicator. The kindly 
old man was on his own this 
tlme . 0 script, no teleprompter. 
Only preconceived answers to 
the hopefully predictable 
questioning by the media. But 
the journalists Insisted in 
publicly pointing out to him the 
fallacies of his statements. And 
Ronald Reagan stuttered and 
stammered away the public 
confidence and trust he and his 
adminIstration once held . 

Today the conservative 
Republicans , failures In the last 
congressional election , face one 
of the greatest hardships since 
the ixon fiasco. The more 
moderate members of the 
preVIOusly tight-knit 
administration are severing 
themselves from the sinking 
Reagan bandwagon and are 
either publicly admitting their 
mistake or claiming they knew 
nothing of the Iranian weapons 
sales. But by far, the largest 
problem is that the public 
relations people can't seem to 
come up with a valid reason for 

the arms shipments. 
The most recent official effort 

in c1eanng the record consisted 
of a foolish attempt at recycling 
the "strategic interest" argument 
previously (and unsuccessfully) 
used to counter the South 
African sanctions proposed by 
Congress. Unfortunately, the 
public isn't as willing to accept 
answers from the White House 
these days, and is demanding a 
more satisfactory explanation . 

What we must realize is that 
there exists a valid reason for the 
shipments. The animosity 
between Reagan's interests and 
the Middle East assures us that 
this was not just a friendly 
gesture . The fact that a valid 
explanation has not yet been 
offered increases the chances 
that the real reason was less than 
ethical. Here are a few 
explanations I have put together. 

1. The Republicans needed a 
pubhclty boost before the 
elections. The release of the 
Lebanese hostages would 
augment public opinton of the 
admInistration. To accomplish 
this , a deal was struck with 

Khomeini where his terrorist 
affiliates in Lebanon would 
release a hostage or two in 
exchange for some much needed 
military supplies so the war wi th 
Iraq could go on as scheduled. 

2. Reagan fears that Iraq. if 
victorious, could align itself with 
the Soviet Union and make Iran 
a Communist state . This 
argument, ethical and righteous 
to some people , is not likely, 
when we now know that some 
American defense contractors are 
being allowed to design weapons 
systems for lraq. 

3. Some defense contractors 
couldn't resist that nice big war 
over there. Weapons are deadly, 
but they're profitable. They 
somehow innuenced the 
Administration to allow them to 
sell their wares to Iran. 

Whatever the true reason was, 
Reagan and his cohorts decided 
that common knowledge could 
threaten military interest or 
public opinion. They decided 
that what we didn't know 
wouldn't hun us. They didn't 
consider. however, what might 
happen if we found Out. ~

Saved my life 
Ed itor: 

Bent on destroying myself, 
seven days into a life-long fast 
with no sleep, I heard the roar of 
an engine behind me - the 
turning and rolling of heavy 
wheels. With the expectations of 
my love shane red by one shon 
phone call , the days that dragged 
into the nights left me weary and 
depressed. If it was finished , I 
was finished , and a quick right 
tum into the oncoming vehicle 
would end the tOnure that I was 
putting my friends, my famtly 
and myself through. 

I made my move but pulled 
back suddenly as not to tOpple 
into the path of the motorized 
wheelchair passing by my side. 

I don't think he noticed me as 
he continued to travel up the 
road in his blue suit - probably 
on his way to class. I just want to 
thank him for giving me the 
strength to keep walking that 
morning. He's an amazing 
individual. Thanks.

Go public Doc 
Editor: 

An open letter to Dr. Watson: 
We would like to express our 

concern over the article in the 
October 29 issue of the Koala . 
We have had , in the last [WO 
weeks , approximately 35-50 
women call or visit our office in 
order to find OUt what kind of 
action will be taken against the 
Koala for printing such blatant 
attacks on women . With the 
sudden increase of rapes on the 
SDSU campus and violent 
aggression directed towards 
women in the media and 
community, it is nor surpnsing 
that the UCSD female population 
should feel that their security on 
this campus is threatened when 
such viciousness is printed in a 
campus paper without the public 
condemnanon of our 

administration. 
We feel that as our Vice 

Chancellor, you have the right 
and responsibility to publicly 
affirm to the UCSD population 
that you will continue to 
implement a\l possible measures 
to insure the security and safety 
of UCSD women. By making a 
public statement we think you 
would be strengthening the belief 
in most UCSD women, that our 
university holds our lives and 
safety in a top priority. 

Panicia Orozco 
Women's Resource Center 

Afraid of them 7 
Editor: 

We have been watching the 
current assault upon the 
principle of free speech here at 
UCSD with considerable interest. 
The conclusion that we have 
inescapable is that there are large 
number of groups and 
individuals here on campus that 
consider themselves to be 
somehow special. This 
apparently gives them the right 
to decide for all of us just exactly 
what we can read , who we can 
hear and even what 
organizations we can interview 
with . Isn 't it nice to know that 

Big Brother and Big .sister are out 
there looking out for our 
impressionable little minds? 

Well, we would rather do it for 
ourselves. You see, you don 't 
own this school and you don't 
own our minds, Mr. Puri , the 
ubiquitous contributor to this 
space, sums up the mistaken 
notion when he implies that free 
speech is perfectly OK as long as 
it's OK with him. Mr. Arnie 
Schoenberg is also special. He 
doesn 't like the military, or much 
else it seems , and has decided 
for all of us that we should n't be 
exposed to it. His statement took 
the form of dousing a group of 
ROTC members with red paint. 

It seems that these special 
people aren't satisfied with just 
altering the color scheme of 
those they don 't like . No, they 
have gotten together and 
unconstitutionally banned the 
CIA, FBI, INS and a\l branches of 
the military from this campus. 
What about those of us who 
don't hate their country? I guess 
we don 't count. 

The latest travesty concerns 
the furor over the Koala's alleged 
sanctioning of sexual assault. 
Never mind that the whole idea 
of the Koala actually condoning 
rape is ludicrous and untrue . 
These people have no sense of 
humor. Perhaps I can explain it 
for you. It's called satire. You see, 
the author of the "Cold Fish" ad 
was making fun of men's ani tude 
toward women . Get it? To even 
suggest that it condones violence 
towards women borders on the 
libelous, 

These people even have a 
suggestion on how to prevent 
humor in the future . They want 
to Impose some "guidelines" on 
the Koala. That's nght Before the 
paper is even published, these 
people will get to go over the 
content to make sure that you 
don't get to see anything that 
they don't want you to . We don 't

Editor: 

I have heard a lot of talk from 
the students of UCSD protesting 
many d iffere nt issues. 

I wo uld like to point our that 
the freedom of speech is one of 
the principles on which this 
country was founded; that every 
person has the right to speak his· 
mind , regardless of his race, sex 
or religion . It is one of the 
ad vantages that make this 
country what it is today. 
Freedom of speech has given the 
American people a place above 

other na tions, the ability to 
speak witpout the fea r of 
government retaliation . 
One of the more recent issues 
brought up by the students of 
UCSD is the military and ROTC 
recruitment on campus. There is 
a la rge number of students who 
believe that these groups should 
not be allowed on campus, 
because a majority of students 
voted against the fund ing of 
these groups at the last school 
elections. 1 read in the Guardian 
that these groups are not being 
funded by our school but that 
they do have the right to come 
and recruit on Revelle Plaza, 
since it has been declared an 
area open to free speech . 
Therefore, they have just as 
much right to be there as anyone 
else. 

I quite ofte n hear my fellow 
students speak out agains t the 
system . They say that it doesn't 
really represent the people; but 
when it comes time to vote , I 
find that many of them don't 
take the time to go to the polls. 
They constantly speak against 
the use of school fund s, yet they 
still pay their tuition. Why? 
These are just a couple of the 
issues in which I hear my fellow 
students contradict themselves. I 
find it hard to support them 
when they begin to sound like 
hypocri tes. 1 respect their 
feelings on these issues, but I 
can 't support the way they are 
expressing them. 

AS injustice

On November 13, the External

Dinstein was flagrantly biased in 
his presenta ti on and painted

of counting the votes wrong and 
accused her of using her 
position to influence the 
Council. From here on in Steven 
Cooper attempted , with the 
backing of ProVOSt Solis, to 
tamish the reputation of Dean 
Varga ," Doe said . 

Cooper said he would like to 
defend himself but is unable to 
because he is being threatened 
with a lawsuit of slander by 
Varga. 

Several weeks ago, Provost 
Solis recalled the minutes of a 
Third College Council meeting 
when she leamed that It 
contained comments she made 
about Varga which she intended 
to be confidential. 

Provost Solis, along with all 
University employees, were 
advised not to comment about 
the case because it was a 
personnel matter. 

"The allegation of 
mismanagement of funds stems 

from a difference of 
philosophies. 

"It was felt that I spent too 
much money on unimportant 
programs like leadership 
training," Varga said . 

Another factor which went 
against Varga was that the Third 
College Council voted not to 
have a staff advisor. Varga was to 
be the staff advisor. 

In a meeting with si x Third 
College student leaders, it was 
said that some of the 
councilmembers felt the vOle not 
to have a staff advisor was 
directed against Varga while 
others said it was no!. 

One student leader said that 
when the Council voted against 
Varga on issues (during Varga's 
term as faculty advisor) , Varga 
was personally offended and 
focused her hun on those who 
went against her. 

"Dean Varga lost her job 
partially as a result of her small 
clique of power-hungry students 
who went after her," an

unnamed source said . 
The meeting of Third College 

student leaders agreed that 
although the student conflicts 
were used in the administration's 
case against Varga, they felt that 
the conflicts couldn 't have been 
enough to terminate a Dean. "I 
know that Steve (Cooper) is 
afraid he's being used as a 
scapegoat by the administration 
to serve their purpose ," an 
anonymous source said . 

Several sources, wh o wished to 
remain anonymous, suggested 
that the administration's true 
reason for investigating Varga 
was not because of student 
con flicts but rather for the way 
in which Varga handled an 
investigation into the 
administration 's criminal charges 
against student activist Russell 
Andalcio. 

Andalcio had been charged by 
the administration with the 
crime of "lynching" (defined as 
inciting a crowd to riot), along 
with other crimes, for his part in 
an altercation which occurred 
after the Bishop Tutu speech last 
year. 

Andalcio, along with most of 
the crowd, started chanting "Let

a man for tearing away a picket 
sign from pro-apartheid 
supporter Brother Jed . With the 
large crowd that had gathered 
around chanting at them, the 
poli e decided to ,release the 
man. 

Varga conducted an 
investigation into the charges 
against Andalcio and determined 
that the administration's charges 
were unfounded , a report by the 
Academic Senate stated . 

"Dean Varga performed her 
responsibilities in a highly 
conscientious and professional 
manner. I was informed that she 
was appalled that the University 
officials did not conduct their 
own investigation before the 
charges were given to the Dean," 
Professor Peter Irons, Andalcio's 
faculty advisor, said . 

"The administration reacted in 
an extremely defensive way and 
still has not admitted an,! wrong-
doing in the handling 0, the 
case ," Irons said . 

Dean Varga said that her 
handling of the Andalcio case 
was included as pan of the 
packet against her that Provost 
Solis had given her.

Andalcio and Varga Varga performed her responsibilities in a highly conscientious and proff'ssional 
manner." Irons asked for the 
Senate investigation because he 
felt that the issues involved in 
the case "are of concem to the 
entire UCSD community, 
[because) the failure to conduct 
an adequate investigation prior 
to the bringing of such serious 
charges was a deplorable 
departure from the principles of 
due process, free speech , and 
academic freedom [which] this 
campus should protect." 

forwarded the charges against 
Mr. Andalcio to Dean Varga 
thought these charges were 
"baseless." 

against Mr. Anda1cio for 
'lynching' could be interpreted as 
imposing a 'chilling effect' on 
such protected behavior. Continued from page 3 

University officials who prepared 
these charges did not conduct 
any investigation before she was 
forced to present the charges to 
Mr. Anda1cio." 

Aguilar has said that the 
divetsionary process does not 
require him to interview 
witnesses or the police: his 
position only requires him to 
evaluate the material within the 
police reports and see whether 
the '''facts : even if they may be 
wrong, violate the Student 
Conduct Code." 

One student source who was 
close to the investigation said, 
"Dean Varga never wanted to 
pursue this case after she saw 
the charge sheet, and was 
outraged at the administrators 
who felt that these violations had 

. any chance of standing up," for , 
according to the ASMR, it 
contained the "impression that 
criminal prosecution was being 
pursued ." 

The source believed that she 
felt like "she was the 'fall woman' 
for the entire process." 

The ASMR concluded that it 
was "our opinion that Mr. Aguilar 
could have better fulfilled his 
profeSSional responsibility by 
seeking funher clarification of 
the police reports .. . he did not 
because he did not consider it 
part of his job . .. " This was 
conceming the four 
characteristics of the case which 
were unusual. 

The first component involved 
the conflicting ambiguities of the 
police reports and Aguilar's 
panicular definition of 
"lynching." The two police 
repons conflicted each other in 
their descriptions of Mr. 
Anda1cio's actual involvement in 
the event. Funhermore , Officer 
Hill charged Anda1cio with 
"lynching" (Califomia Penal 
Code definition: the taking of 
any person by means of a riot 
from the lawful custody of any 
peace officer), while Officer 
Blakeny did not. 

Mr. AgUilar, as mentioned 
before, chose to define 
"lynching" in another manner. 

The second distinguishing 
fearure of the ASMR is "the fact 
that the police , according to 
testimony, had previously had 
several negative encounters with 
Mr. Andalcio. When asked if 
there was any reason to believe 
that the police were prejudiced 
against Mr. Andalcio , Chief 
Anderson responded, "Yes." Both 
sec Aguilar and Vice Chancellor 
Watson were , according to their 
testimony, aware of Mr. 
Andalcio's previous encounters 
with the police," the report 
stated . Mr. Andalcio's most 
serious encounter came with 
them in October of 1985 when 
the police tore flyers off the 
ground that he and others had 
posted to publicize a rally that 
moming. This action sparked a 
series of student protests. 

The third distinguishing 
feature was the "political and 
emotional nature of the case ... a 
black student was being accused 
of '1ynching" in an encounter 
with police officers during 'Black 
History Week' after an anti-
apartheid speech by Bishop 
Tutu . Anderson , Aguilar, and 
Watson ... were aware of the 
highly sensitive nature of the 
case. On the one hand , pressing 
charges again t Mr. Andalcto 
ri sked tudent demonstratlons 
and pubhc condem nation of the 
administra ti on On the o ther 

hand, any shOwing of special 
treatment for Mr. Andalcio risked 
the judgement of partiality and 
timidity." 

During the rwo-week period 
that the case was pending, the 
administration was publicly 
assailed on campus by a vanety 
of individuals and groups. 

The ASMR states, however, 
that the administrative officials 
"fell under pressure to act with 
the utmost propriety." Vice 
Chancellor Watson . told sec 
Aguilar, "Treat this case as you 
would treat any other." 

The fourth distinguishing 
fearure of the Andalcio case is 
that "after interviewing 22 
witnesses, and receiving 
numerous 'letters from 'faculty, 
staff, and students who were also 
witnesses, Dean Varga could find 
no corroboration of the 
descriptions which the police 
reportS gave of Mr. Andalcio's 
behavior." 

Dr. Irons, who requested the 
Academic Senate's investigation 
of the Andalcio case , said "Dean 

Dr. Irons also requested that 
Vice Chancellor Watson write a 
letter of apology to Mr. Andalcio. 
The Senate, however, did not 
find Dr. Watson negligent in his 
duty, nor did they "believe that 
he owes Mr. Anda1cio an 
apology." 

The ASMR did find that "issue 
of free speech and assembly are 
pertinent to the case ... [the 
crowd) exercised their 
constirutionally protected rights 
of free speech [and] the citation 
and subsequent accusations 

"In light of the outcome of 
Dean Varga's investigation, we 
feel satisfied that this case did 
not establish any precedent 
unfavorable to the exercise of 
free speech and assembly on 
campus." ~ 

Irons said, "Any effort to 
impose a chilling effect on 
freedom of speech and assembly 
on this campus, by the bringing 
of baseless charges against any 
member of the UCSD 
community, is a matter of grave 
concem." The ASMR did not 
support this assertion that the 
administrative officials who 

Dr. Peter Irons acted as Andalcio 's advisor; Dr. Watson told Aguilar to treat the 
case as any other.

A Note from the Provost 
Just in case you don't know where Warren College is, it is where 

all the big cranes are , where the Magnetic Recording Research 
Center is, where the structure (earthquake) lab is, where the

the previous year. Campus-wide, the SAT h.as increased by, 23 
points over the same period . We are gettmg ahead! (A httle 
nerdier?) . 

In the apartments, we still have 61 units with 5 people each. We 
hope to eliminate all quintets by Fall '87. 

On the academic side, students who entered Fall '86 must clear

Spring 1987 Internships 
We will begin receiving applications for Spring Quarter 

internships the week ofJanuary 12 (2nd week of Winter Quarter). 
Sorry! Applications for Winter Quarter ~re closed. . 
Here's what some former interns said about the Academlc 

Internship program: 
"In my final year at UCSD, 1 participated in two internships. The 

first was in the Winter quarter, during which I wrote for a 
community newspaper and gained material for my portfolio. The 
second was in the Spring, and led dIrectly to a Job Wlth the largest 
public relations firm in San Diego_ Without the expenence ~med 
during these two internships, I never would have been conSIdered 
for the position I now hold ." 

-Communications major, Muir College. 
"[ feel that AI.P. is one of the best things that UCSD has to offer 

undergraduates. " 
-Communications major, Warren College. 

"1 feel myself becoming m~re and ~ore fam!liar with t~e real~ty 
of profeSSional theater and Its workmgs. ThiS for me}s cruCial 
since I am planning a professlOnal career 10 the fIeld . 

-Drama major, Third College. 
"A positive feeling I have about the internship is that I a~ 

getting involved in something that is important. This research Wlll 
hopefully help us one day prevent widespread alcohol abuse." 

-Psychology major, Warren College. 
"[ am learning a great deal about a subject that [ enjoy and hope 

to pursue in the future ." 
-Sociology major, Third College. 

"You won't regret it. My internship has been the best job I've ever 
had!" 

-Computer Science major, Warren College. 
"I learned more during the first three days of my internship than 

Ileamed during an entire course on the same topic. It was so much 
easier to see things actually happen than to guess at what a text 
book was describing. I'll always be grateful for what I've learned. I 
think the ALP. is a great program." 

-Management Science major, Revelle College 
"What would be the best way to obtain experience before 

graduating? A hands-on position with an appropria~e comp~ny. 
The easiest way to do this , I found, was through an mternshlp. I 
was pleased with the ALP. It provides a convenient, 
uncomplicated means of acquiring the experience that .fu.ture 
employers look for. If I had the opportun.ity, I wou~d defml~ly 
intern again through the ALP. The expenence [ gamed dunng 
(hose ten weeks, was, I feel I truly helpful and valuable." 

-Computer Engineering major, Third C?lleg~ . 
"I feel positively about this internship because the project IS 

closely related to what I am learning in sch~l now, It i.s the field I 
want to get into, and the headqua~ers en~ronment gl~es n:te the 
chance to understand the engineer s role 10 a corporanon, 10 the 
industry and in American society."

Youth share tales of turbulent countries 
By VALERIE TIANO 

CHILDREN of War is not the name of a new movie it is much more real than 
that. It is a project that brings 
young people from war-tom 
areas to the United Sta tes in an 
effort to educate American youth. 
Children of War is a global effon 
which unites teens in a unique 
partnership. 

A total of 60 teenagers who 
represent over 19 international 
locations including Ireland. 
Ethiopia, El Salvador. and Haiti 
are planned to tour nationally. 
San Diego will be one of the 27 
ci ties planned as pan of the 
tour's itinerary. A total of five 
students will visit San Diego 
including an Israeli. a 
Palestinean , a South African, a 
Chilean, and a teen from the 
Marshall Islands. They are 
scheduled to share the personal 
day-to-day conflicts of their 
countries with American youth . 

joining the foreign students on 
the tour will be 18 U.S. students 
who will be presenting various 
concerns which plague American 
society, such as the homeless, 
the worsening farm cnsis, and 
drug addiction. 

The ReligiOUS Task Force, a 
national interfaith peace and 
justice network, is sponsoring 
the tour. Representatives from 
civic, religious, peace-related , 
and educational institutions are 
also a pan of the San Diego 
Coalition which suppons the 
1986 Children of War tour. 

Kathy Smith , San Diego 
Children of War tour Coordinator 
said , "The tour is imponant for 
multicultural education and 
global relations. Social concerns 
are appropriate and essential for 
the classroom. Interpersonal 
relations," she continued, 
"connect kids to global issues in

a meaningful way. Reading a 
newspaper is not enough: 

The tour follows 
Empowerment Principles, and 
places a strong emphasis on the 
"peer-teaching-peer" model. This 
enables young people to draw 
upon their own strength» and 
common sense to promote cross-
cultural understandin,l!.. 

The 1984 Children of War tour 
illustrated that these principles 
are an effective method in 
unifying and inspiring people. 
Forry teenagers from across the 
world toured 54 U.5. cities. The 
teenagers and their messages 
were well received by other 
youth s and adultS. 

In response to a story told by 

A friend ora photon? 
By BARAK KASSAR 

W E could end up comrades. brothers in arms. or perhaps 
monal enemies. The nature of 
our relauonships lay in the 
hands of the dark people -
those dressed in Jetblack. We 
marched slowly through the 
turnstile , armed with heavy belts 
and black power-packs which 
were to enable us to kill and 
hence survive in the place where 
we were going to fight a war -
an unknown place called Planet 
Photon. 

"Red , green, green, green, red , 
red, green . red .. . n We were 
labeled and received respective 
uniforms. While slipping the 
chest shIeld over my neck, a 
man slinked s ilently from 
behind. He helped me with my 
cumbersome red helmet and 
lugged it into the outlet on my 
waist-powe r-pack "Good luck, 
and be care ful ," he said 
cautiously. I pulled my phaser-
gun from its slot and looked at it 
carefully. 

We marched on, into an ill lit 
room. Those in red went one 
way; those in green , another. I 
put my phaser in one hole, my 
computer passport in another 

~Iot and stood in a CIrcle of light. 
"Name," grunted another masked 
person . "Phospho ," I replied and 

I had spelled it for him. I walked 
on and listened as my 
companion entered his name: 
"LIpId ." 

Fifteen of us, red ones, now 
waited in our strategy room - a 
small cubicle in the crazy maze 
that is Planet Photon . We wore 
dark clothing; we were shadows, 
but had none in the amficial 
night. We had names, not 
eanhly ones, but rather 
"Bladerunner," "Skywalker," 
"Zapmaster," and "Disruptor." 

Our self-appointed leader 
stood tall. "All right," he 
whispered in case the greenies 
could hear us , "five good 
shooters stay back and guard our 
base; the rest of you get their 
base. Then all of you rotate and 
we can get lot sa points." He 
pointed to a fluorescent map on 
the wall . 

The leader was a veteran of 
the Photon wars and 
undoubtedly proud of it. My 
compamon and myself were 
"nubies" on the planet, whIch 
means we had never been there 
before; we were space virgins of 
sons. 

There were no smiles 
exchanged . There were wars to 
be won here , battles with the 
green people . and the battles we 
fought with ourselves, we had to 

test our abilities to survIve . 
SynthetiC fog rose from the 

ground and caressed the 
darkness. We held phasers in 
our hands - we had a mission. 
We were to render the green 
base moperable and kill as many 
of the green people as we could . 
We had six and a half mmutes 
to do thIS and It promised to be 
pure Photonic chaos. 

I proved my utter ineptitude 
with a firearm of any sort. Were 
Photon a real \var, I'd be 
mcognito in Mexico shouti ng, 
"Margantas not grenades ," 
because real war is difficult. 

But Photon Isn 't for real , its 
Just a game. 

It 's been billed as "The 
UlLimate Game on Planet Earth." 

The game is located just south 
of Huntington Beach in a 
building you can see from the 
San Diego Freeway. It consIsts of 
a rwo level maze where 15 green 
people in a heanless, if not real , 
space battle. The headgear, 
beSIdes adding a dImenSIOn of 
futuris tic reality, contai ns 
speakers. Players hear dl fferent 
sounds depending on what they 
do. Hitting an opponent 
produ es one sound and the 
computer which runs the game 
awards thal player 10 point!>. 

Please tum to page 11 

a South African teen, an 
American ninth grader, jesse 
Kahn , was shocked by 
descriptions of apartheid. Kahn 
responded, "I never knew there 
were places in the world that 
have worse discrimination than 
we ever had in America. When 
we're taught about other 
countries, it's about the years 
they had ".,oars. We don't learn 
about the people , about cruelty 
in the world . Things are softened 
because they think we're 
children and can't take it. But 
we're the people who will be 
living here . We have to knuw 
what's going on ." 

The tour is to educate people 
and create an ambiance and 
atmosphere that will break down 
some of the hostility," Mariam 
Goldberg said, a volunteer from 
Physicians for Social 
Responsibility .• American youth 
is removed from world problems. 
Children oj War is targeting a 
group which needs to be alened, 
aware, and realistic about these 
problems," she added . 

Children are chosen to 
participate through referrals from 
organizations in their 
hometowns. Two San Diego high 
schools, Clairemont High and 
San Diego High, were asked to 
submit candidates for the 
program because of their 
involvement in specialized 
curricula, which include a Model 
United Nations and a peer 
mediation model program. 

Each panicipating City was 
asked to contribute '55,000 for 
the program. As of October I, 
San Diego had been able to 
contribute $2,180 ($ 1,590 for 
national costS, $590 for local 
costs). 

The focus of the 1986 Children 
oj War LOur will be on follow-up 
and ongoing activities. A national 
youth speakers bureau, 
audiovisual resources, 
international annual summer 
workshops in conflict areas, a 
newsletter, and peace leadership 
traini ng will be a pan of this 
effort. At the conclusion of the 
1986 tour, panicipants will 
attend a week-long international 
gathering as pan of UNICEPs 
40th Anniversary, and the 
United Nations Year of Peace in 
1986. It will include panicipants 
from the 1984 and 1986 Children 
af War tours . 

"The idea of peace is real and 
this awareness is just the 
beginning of international 
networking. No one group is 
responsible." Smith feels

Getting hit produces a very 
different sound, and I know it 
well. When one is hit, they lose 
ten points and are disrupted , 
meaning their phaser will not 
work for 5 seconds. 

A huge omniscient computer 
moniters everything. When 
players plug In their guns and ID 
passports into the machine 
before the game , they plug into 
the ultimate referee - a 
computer that sees aU . Other 
rules and technicalities apply, 

but the basic idea is to cooperate

UCSD wins third championship 
Tritons beat host Calvin in front of 3300 hostile partisans 

Lori Luhnow (above) hugs UCSD volleyball coac h Doug Dannevih. Tritons ha\le reason to celebrate after winning their third national title in 
six years . 

By GUS SANTOYO, Sports Editor 

EXPERTS will tell you that West Coast volleyball is the best m the nation, 
but the people of Grand Rapids, 
Michigan did not want to be heve 
it. Their beloved Calvin College 
was in the finals of th e NCAA 
Division III Women's Volleyball 
Championships. DivisIOn III style, 
and what seemed like the whole 
town came out to see those sun-
tanned beachsters from SoCal, 
namely UC San Diego, spiked 
Midwest-style. 

They should have listened to 
the expertS. 

In front of a ravenous, 
standing room only crowd of 
3300, UCSD, the number one 
team in the nation , came back 
from a 2- 1 games defiCit to beat 
Calvin 15-4, 10-15, 3-15, 15-3, 
15-5. 

UCSD, the number one team 
in the ,nation , was favored to win 
the national championship, after 
Elmhurst College of Illinois was 
upset m the regionals. 

But going up against Calvin in 
their backyard was no easy task. 
"That was as loud a crowd as I've 
ever seen ," said UCSD head 
coach Doug Dannevik. "The 
whole ~own came out to the 
game. We had seven people, 
including (athletic director) Jud y 
Sweet, rooting for us. The odds 
were really against us." 

As the panisan crowd created 
an ear-shattering din for Calvin , 
Dannevik and his troop became 
very demonstrative. "Every time 
they would shout 'Calvin , Calvin' 
we would shout UCSD amongst 
ourselves," said Lori Luhnow, 
who was also a member of the 
1984 national championship 

team. "It gave us confidence." 
Confidence was not the only 

thing the Tritons needed to 
overcome not only the rabid 
crowd, but also a 31-game home 
winning streak. For Dannevik, it 
was thei r mental toughness that 
led to UCSD winning it's third 
na tional championship in six 
years. 

"We are just so strong 
mentally," said Dannevik. "I had 
the confidence we would win, it 
was so typical. No one can 
sustain two hours of good 
volleyball against us, and this is 
what happened against Calvin." 

Although the match did go 
five games, and UCSD trailed 2-1 
going mto the fourth game, 
Dannevik was never worried. "I 
felt we were the best team and 
although we didn 't have good 
practices up there , I knew we 'd 
win . We haven't los t a five game 
match in two years ." 

Monica Bradley was named 
MVP of the tournament and 
according to Dannevik, 
deservedly so. "Monica saved her 
very best match for the finals," 
said Dannevik. "It 's her only real 
honor in the four years she's 
been here and I'm happy she gOt 
it. She was super." 

O thers to gamer honors to the 
all tournament team were setter 
Kim Stonecipher and do-
everything Carol Lipson . Lipson , 
Stonecipher and hitter Janet 
Hughes were also named to the 
All American team. 

"I will go on record saying that 
this team is the best team ever In 
the history of the school ," said 
Dannevik. "They represented 
UCSD perfectly and the school 

should be extremely p roud of 
this team." 

With the team not getting out 
of the gymnasium until after 
midnight, the celebration was 

regulated to beer and pizza in 
the hotel. Yet close to a hundred 
people, including television 
crews, greeted the team at the 
airport on Sunday. 'We didn 't 

want to come back second best," 
said Dannevik, "and we 
didn'!." 

Soccer team loses final 

Robert Paterson and the !tam came up short in the championship game. 

U NUKE the women's volleyball team, Sunday was not a day of 
celebration for the UCSD men's 
soccer team. Led by goalie Tony 
Hannum, the Nonh Carolina-
Greensboro Spartans shut out the 
Tritons 2-0 to win their founh 
national c'hampionship in five 
years. 

Greensboro was the host for 
the final four tOurnaments, as the 
semifinal and final games were 
played there on Friday and 
Saturday. 

In Friday's semifinal game, 
UCSD was forced to go to 
overtime to PUt away Messiah 
College, 2-1. Both Triton goals 
were scored by John "Bubba" 
Wingate, earning them the right 
to play on Saturday. 

But the victory was costly. 
Roben Paterson, Joe Giacalone, 
and Mike Bradley all suffered 
injuries so the team was depleted 
for the final match of the season. 

Greensboro dominated 
~ Saturday'S championship game l with seventeen shots on goal to 
11 UCSD's six. IronicaUy, however, 
'" their first goal came because a 
$ Triton player deflected the baU j into his own net. The game's 
.... only other score came on a goal 

by Spanan Alvin Jones in the 
second half. 

'Top Guns' 
make 

• • promIsIng 
debut 

~ HE men's basketball team has a plan, the Marshall Plan, which made 
a successful debut Friday, thanks 
in part to the highly touted 
Tritons' top guns, who scored 
over half in UCSD's 92-83 
Victory over Azusa-Pacific. 

Azusa played the Tritons close 
in the first half, maintaining a 
46-44 lead , But then a barrage of 
bombs, led by Brian Backen's 32 
points, pushed the Tritons to a 
comfonable 81-66 lead. 

Then came the big mistake. 
The Tritons had five minutes on 
the clock to bum and decided to 
milk the clock. 

Bad move, Azusa Pacific 
. trapped and scurried, forcing 
several Triton turnovers. The 
Cougars took advantage on most 
opportunities, including a couple 
of vicious slams by Alex Adams, 
cutting the lead to 89-82, but it 
was too little too late . 

UCSD head coach Tom 
Marshall admits that pan of his 
game plan was an experiment. 

• "We didn't handle that very well, 
but it's early in the season and 1 
wanted to see how we'd react." 

Yet Marshall was satisfied with 
his team's averaU performance. 
"We haven't gelled as a team," 
said MarshaU, "but things will get 
better as the season progresses." 

Azusa-Pacific coach Cliff 
Hamlow conceeded his team's 
inability to handle UCSD's 
scori ng attack. "They just 
overshot us," said Hamlow. 

While- most of us will be 
gorging on that de~ectable bird, 
UCSD will be hosting the Truon 
Tip-Off Tournament this Friday 
and Saturday. Redlands. Cal·State 
Stanislaus, and Claremont-Mudd 
will be among the pan ici pants. .

'Mystery Man' still remains 
a mystery to most students 

Last Monday's cover of the Guardian included a 
rare picture of UCSD ChanceUor Richard Atkinson 
happily enjoying the Western Regional Final 
between the TritOns and Menlo CoUege. Rumor has 
it that it was Atkinson 's first volleybaU game ever, yet 
members of the athletic adminfstration were 
ecstatic over his attendance. 

"It was tremendous seeing the Chancellor at the 
game," said Bert Kobyashi. chair of the PE 
department. "It shows the kind of enthusiasm we've 
been able to develop for the volleybaU program," 

Atkinson's appearance, though, didn't seem to 
impress the crowd, many having no idea who he 
was. 

How unfamiliar are students with Atkinson? ·You 
should have run a 'Name this guy' contest," 
suggested Kobyashi. "I don 't think too many would 
have entered ." 

In a midKason poll of NFL teams, Newsday;s 
Peter King found that fifteen of the twenty-eight 
teams plan to vote to continue the instant replay. 
Seven will vote "no" and six refused to comment or 
haven't decided. To continue the system in 1987, 
twenty-one "yes" votes are required.

Some quotes from Bob Chieger's Voices oJBaseball: 
- "Ninety percent ru spend on good times, women

in 1975. 
- "A baUplayer could go to college and be a 
sportswriter. But what writer could be a baUplayer? 
And teU me this: What college did the twelve 
apostles go to?" Billy Manin defending the charge 
that players are dumb , 1981. 
-"Well, that kind of puts the damper on even a 

. Yankees win," Phil Rizzuto after announcing Pope 
Paul VI had JUSt died, 1978. . 
- "Herndon seems to be bothered by insects at the 
plate. I don't know what species it is. Maybe it's an 
infield fly." Announcer Hank Greenwald, 1981.

Sadistic soccer shootouts 
By ROBERT LEONE, Staff Wnur 

BOTH of UCSD's intercollegiate soccer teams earned playoff berths. 
There, Ihey have encountered 
the third most brutal and sadisti c 
ritual in the world of sport , 
exceeded only by Spamsh-style 
bullfights and postgame 
lockerroom interviews with 
World Series losers. It is the 
shootout, the penalty kick, the 
traditional method of choosing a 
winner in a game if the score is 
tied after a number of overtime 
periods. 

In essence, it 's simple. A 
player from one team tries, at 
close range, to kick a goal. The 
goalie from the other team tries 
to prevent a goal. The goalie 
must stay on the goal line until 
the ball is kicked, usuaUy 
towards a comer the goalie can't 
defend . After the attempt, the 
goalies are switched , and a 
player from the first goalie's team 
also attempts to kick a goal. This 
goes o n five limes , then if both 
teams make the same number of 
goals , is tried again , and if 

necessary again. 
It is the rules, they say. But I 

have yet to encounter a player or 
coach who likes that rule . 
Goalies hate it. After UCSD 
Women's Soccer coach John 
Leaney saw St. Mary's College 
defeat Methodist with oenalty 
kicks, he admonished !'is team 
not to "put me through that. " St. 
Mary's coach Dan Blank, when 
asked about shotouts , said he 
didn 't like them at all . The next 
day, UCSD defeated St. Mary's 
after a scoreless game by 

winning a shootout. Players have 
said that it is highly 
unsatisfactory for soccer. which 
is an action game, to be decided 
by this static means. It's a terrible 
way to win, they say. II's even 
worse to lose that way. 

The penalty kick system of 
deciding a game is hard. Why 
should a tied soccer game be 
decided by ten kicks? This 
system is of appeal only towards 
those who need a winner and a 
loser in every athletic cpntest, 
and need that winner without 
too many time-consuming 
overtime periods. Unfortunately, 
the creators of the NCAA Soccer 
Championship format are 
members of that group. That may 
be the rules. But the rules are cruel.

What's Happening to Student Wages? 
The A.S. External Affairs lobby wants you to kn~ that in the past several months UCSA has uncovered 
several pay cuts. In each event, the student employees were not consulted prior to the cuts and In at least 
one instance , student employees did not even know about the cuts until they re<:eived their shrunken 
pay checks. The most recent wave of cuts began last June when. without even consulting with their 
union and at 8:30 am during finals week, Berkeley library workers were told their jobs would be 
downgraded, resulting in wagc cuts of as much at ~1.70 per hour for new employees, Most recently, 
Media Services student jobs at Riverside were put on a "two-tier" system under whIch new employees 
performing the same work were paid 5.50 an hour less than last year's workers. And dining hall 
employees at Berkeley had their pay slashed S 1.50 per hour in the middle of the month despite a 
moratorium on pay cutS agreed to by UC systemwlck Administration. 
Why is the University doing this? 
They claim their new polIcies are fairer , 
Student employees have a hard time seeing what's fairer about lower wages. 
Your pey, or that of a fl;end or co-worker, may have already been cut and you may not even know it. 
UCSA is fighting to prOtcct your paycheck. In fact , where UCSD has been informed of a covert wage cut, 
we have been successful in restOring the affected students pay. including obtaining back pay. But we 
can't TIght thelM! wrongs unless we know about them. That's why we've instituted the -Pay Check.' Call 
your Campus Employee Relations Coordinator or the UCSD Sacramento Office to find OUt more about 
how you can help save student pay. For more information call: Erik Basil 534-4450.
