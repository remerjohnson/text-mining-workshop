Court Rejects Legal Challenge 
to $3B In Stem Cell Funds 

Cops Considered Cash for Cuffs 
UCSD dept. proposal 
promised officers perks 
for arrests. Chief says it 
was never implemented. 

Judge trumps challenge 
to state agen~y. Taxpayer 
groups promIse an 
appeal, which would tie 
up research funding. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

A trial court judge moved one 
step closer to opening up billions 
of dollars in fu nding for stem cell 
research by rejecting a challenge to 
California's $3 billion tern cell ini-
tiative. 

The lawsuit, filed by two taxpayer 
groups, conte ted the constitution-
ality of the California Institute for 
Regenerative Medicine, which they 
said did not include adequate state 
oversight when it was created by 
the voter-approved Proposition 71 
in 2004. 

The court battle has tied up 
money meant for the state stem cell 
agency, which was slated to receive 
$300 million annually for the next 
decade from the institute. The rul -
ing, however, frees up that funding, 
which institute officials hope to use 
to move research forward. 

In their lawsuit, the groups 
claimed that the institute, funded 
by taxpayers, was not under proper 
state control. Judge Bonnie Sabraw, 
however, rejected the reasoning. 

· Plaintiffs did not present any 

evidence that the state is appro-
priating funds for any purpose or 
benefit other than a publiC purpose 
- the public purpose declared in 
Proposition 71 of fighting disease 
and promoting the general economy 
of the state:' she wrote. Sabraw also 
rebuffed other claims by the groups, 
which included conflicts of interest 
within the agency's steering com-
mittee. 

For example, UCSD Vice 
Chancellor of Health Sciences Edward 
W. Holmes is both a member of 
the institute's independent oversight 
committee and a proponent of the 
new La Jolla stem cell research con-
sortium, which includes UCSD, the 
Burnham Institute, the Salk Institute 
and the Scripps Research Institute. 

The consortium is one in a long 
line of entities vying for money. 
Earlier this month, a coalition of 
private institutions loaned $14 mil -
lion in bonds to the institute, with 
a few million that will be available 
immediately. 

The challengers are still vowing 
to fight the stem cell research effort, 
and said that they would appeal the 
judge's decision. At the very least, 
the lawsuit puts pressure on the state 
to properly direct stem cell re earch, 
according to John Simpson, stem cell 
project director for the Foundation 
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.

UCSD police officers rest in the John Muir College quad. Under a proposed policy, officers 
would have received $10 gift certificates for every arrest made. 

By Vladimir Kogan 
SENIOR STAFF WRI rFR 

Faced with an end-of-the year 
spike in certain crimes - particu -
larly bike thefts - a top UCSD 
Police Department officer sugge t-
ed in a memo that the department 
start paying officers for individual 
arrest . 

Calling the plan "uc D Police 
New Year's Resolutions," Sgt. Tom 
Morris wrote in a Dec. 27 e-mail 
that beginning the following month , 
each officer would receive a $ 10 gift 
certificate to the business of thei r 
choice each time they took "action 
leading to the arrest of a suspect for 
auto theft, auto burglary or bicycle 
theft." 

The top squad at the end of 
January was also promised a catered 
party, as was the entire department 
if the total arrests reached the goal 
of 20 for the month. 

Both Morris and Police Chief 
Orville King, however, now say the 
policy was never put into place. 

"Number one, that was never 
implemented, and it's not something 
J would ever endorse, support or 
condone:' King said in an interview 
late last week. "There's absolutely, 
without any reservation, no incen -
tives, no rewards, nothing of that 
nature." 

UC Outreach Report Unlikely to Silence Critics Both said the memo was part of an internal brainstorming session, 
and was never meant for public 
consumption. By Vladimir Kogan 

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

In an interview with this paper 
last year, UC President Robert C. 
Dynes outlined his philosophy 
toward the university's academic 
preparation programs: "I'm will -
ing to put academic preparation 
money - outreach money - into 
anything that proves successful. No 
goofy ideas, but anything that actu-
ally achieves success." 

However, a decade after the uni -
versity first introduced the pro-
grams, critics continue to argue 
that neither Dynes nor the UC 
campuses actually know how to 
separate "goofy ideas" from suc-
cessful ones. 

Having spent hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars on outreach, the 
university responded to its detrac-
tors last week, releasing the first 
comprehensive study of the efforts. 
Despite its lofty claims, though, the 
new data is unlikely to calm the 
coptroversy. 

"I think what the report pro-
vides is kind of a first step in the 
right direction," said Anthony 
Simbol, an outreach skeptic who 
oversees higher education for the 
Legislative Analyst's Office, the 
state Legislature's nonpartisan pol-

"Occasionally, what I do is that I 
give the guys an opportunity to float 
ideas internally to me," King said . 
"A nd that's what it was." 

Morris tated in an e-mail that 
the plan came "forward as part of 
brainstorming to deal with crime 
issues, and was rejected almost 
immediately and was definitely not 
implemented."· 

"What you are referring to was 
part of a draft document that was 
put out for discussion internally 
and included some suggestions to 
highlight and address the top crime 
issues we were having at the end 
of last year:' Morris stated. "The 
idea of incentives was immediately 
discarded. What were implemented 
were some prevention and enforce-
ment strategies that were directed 
specifically at the crime problems, 
such as educating the community 
about the problems and how to pre-
vent them." 

However, the language and tone 
of the communique suggests that 
its target audience was somewhat 
larger than both Morris and King 
have described, and that the plan 
was largely final.

Campus Partners With 

Britain for Research 
In an effort to accelerate 

research in the areas of tissue engi-
neering and stem cells, UCSD has 
joined forces with the SETsquared 
Partn'ership, a collaboration of 
British universities in Bath, Bristol. 
Southampton and Surrey. 

The SETsquared Partnership has 
ties to four companies on Britain's 
Alternative Investment Market 
with a combined value of more 
than $265 million and has raised 
more than $53 million for projects. 
The Partnership, which represents 
nearly 6,500 researchers and 8 
percent of British research funding, 
has also supported more than 170 
tech companies. 

The partnership will officially 
begin in the first week of May, 
and will feature a ceremony with 
comments from Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and meetings between 
British scientists and their col-
leagues from the UCSD biology 
and engineering departments, 
the San Diego Supercomputer 
Center and Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

to nearly $300,000 and aver-
age about $30,000 each, were 
granted to nine of 40 applicants 
from facuity across UCSD, its 
Neurosciences Institute, Salk 
Institute for Biologica l Sciences 
and Scripps Research Institute. 

The faculty members given 
awards spanned across many 
fields, including anthropology, 
cognitive science, neurobiology, 
political science, psychiatry and 
psychology. 

The Kavli Institute was estab-
lished in November 2004 after 
a $7.5 million gift from physicist 
Fred Kavli. 

The institute explores the ori-
gins, evolution and mechanisms 
of human cognition, ranging from 
behavior studies to analyses of 
physical and biochemical func-
tions in the brain. 

Students March to

Dozens of UCSD students and 

staff took to the San Diego streets 
last week to participate in a pro-
immigration march from Balboa

The Kavli Institute for Brain and 
Mind, based at UCSD, announced 
winners of its Innovative Research 
Awards last week, which are given 
based on "ideas that bridge differ-
ent levels of organization of brain 
and mind." 

The protest was part of a recent 
trend that has spread to every 
corner of the nation in past weeks, 
sparked by the U.S. House of 
Representatives' passage of a bill 
in December that makes entering 
the country illegally a felony.

Hear No Evil. 

JENNIFER HSU/GU~RDIAN 

By Meghan Durham 
STAFF WRITER No Evil. 
here's no question 
that Google is now the Internet's premier search engine. 
Clean, fast and pop-up free, it has even entered the public 
vocabulary as a verb: to Google. But Google is known for 
having a mission beyond just being just a great search engine. 

Google's stated aim is "to o~anize the 
world's information and make it universally 
accessible and useful." A nice statement, but the 
philosophy link on their Web site goes even fur-
ther. One of the "ten things Google has found . 
to be true" is: · You can make money without 
doing evil." Evil isn't a word you hear often in 
corporate America, but Google has made it part 
of their corporate philosophy to not be evil. 

And the thing about GOOgIe is that the . 
company actually seems to take this philosophy 
seriously. Most uSers of Google know how they 
have kept their pages dean of ads, especially 
ads from the alcohol and tobacco industries. A 
Coogle user also can be fairly certain that the 
results he finds are actually results, and not sites 
that coporations have paid Google to pimp. 

Now enter China. Quite obviously, the 
Chinese government censors information, and 
with the frightening exchange of ideas on the 
Internet, it makes sense that they've launched 
a huge campaign to restrict their users from 
researching certain subjects. The International 
Herald Tribrme mentions that "democracy, 
Tiananmen, Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet" 
are just a few of the hundreds of subjects 
that Chinese censors disallow Internet users in 
China from accessing. 

So far, Internet companies have been jump-
ing over themselves to accommodate this. The 
most famous of these companies is Yahoo, 
who helped the Chinese track down Chinese 
journalist Shi Tao. Shi Tao, who worked for 

a business daily, was sentenced to 10 years 
behln~ bars for sending an anonymous e-mail 
to foreign news media warning about the pos-
sible threat posed by the 15th anniversary of 
the Tiananmen 1tiI1inga. Yahoo provided the 
tools necessary to trade him down, a move that 
Reporters Without Borders says makes them a 
·police informant." 

into a country where we are juat beginning to 
operate and tell that country how to operate." 
And to their credit, Coogle is striving to dis-
dose when its results are censored, and it does 
not offer bios 01' e-mail senicea that it mi8lJt be 
forced to tum over to the government. 

But Google's debut in China is a WOI'l'}'inI 
compromise of their central principles. Rebecca 

MacKinnon, a former 
foreign correspondent in 

Until .necently, Goog1e has 
stayed out of the fray, and 
their only link to the Chinese 
market was a heavily cen-
sored version of their engine 
that often crashed and was 
remarkably slow. But now 
Google has released a Chinese 
language version of their 
search engine ca1Jed "Gu Ge-

that actively censors Web sites 
that the Chinese government 
deems inappropriate. The

move sent shock wava throughout the Internet 
community. Doesn't this interfere with making 
infurmation universally accessible and useful? 

Google says no. The BBC- reports that 
although Google considers removing search 
results inconsistent with the company's mis-
sion, "providing no information or a heavily 
degraded user experience that amounts to no 
information is more inconsistent with our mis-
sion." Google CEO Eric Schmidt even went as 
far as saying, "I think it's arrogant for us to walk 

they won't do the same 
thing in re5pODK to potentially illegal cIemancb 
by an overzealpua govmtQlent aeency in our 
own country?- Although GoogJe has so far 
stood their ground and oppoIeCI handing over 
records to the U.S. government. their choices in 
China signal a slippery slope. 

No one doubts that ~hina is a huge, mostly 
untapped market for Internet companies. There . 
are more than 100 million people in China with 
Internet access, yet that iI leu than 8 percent 
of the country's population. Some companieI 

even expect the e-commerce markd there to be 
worth $390.9 billion in 2009, when It'l expected 
that more people will use the Internet in Chins 
than in the United States.

could lose the company millions of doUan of 
business. ·The trade-otr.' he explained, is in the 
"best interesU of our uten IocatecI in ChiDa.." 
Currently, China only accounts for a small por-
tion of GoogIe's revenues, but with their recent 
acquisition of a licenle to allow it to carry 
1oca1 ~ experta expect that to dwIp 
quicldy. It seems that Goosfe, supposedly the

Division I Move Doesn't Have to Dumb Down Academics 
M e: "I go to .UCSD." Anyone outside the San Diego area: "Oh, the 
party school?" 

"No, that's SDSU." 
"Oh, the Catholic school." 
"No, that's USD." 
"Oh "'. what school did you say 

you were from again?" 
Wouldn't it be grand if you could 

go anywhere in the country and 
say "I go to UCSD" only to have 
someone yeU back -Go Tritons'"? 
Yeah, that would be nice. One 
way in which many schools have 
achieved that goal is through tele-
vised Division I sports. 

Before I go further, I must men-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR-----
Article Downplays 

Dangers of Censorship 
Dear Editor: 

I was disturbed to read ·Intolerant 
Speech Threatens Minority Free 
Expression" by Ian S. Port. It was dis-
tressing to see a journalist arguing 
for restrictions of the press. The first 
question that comes to mind is who 
would set the restrictions? It can-
not be Congress because it is explic-
itly banned from doing so by the First 
Amendment. It can't be the states 
because they are explicitly banned from 
doing so by the 14th Amendment. So 
who is left to set up these restrictions 
Ian S. Port is advocating? The city of 
San Diego? The administration? The 
A.S. Council? The editorial board 
of the Guardian? The Koala? I don't 
know about you but I don't trust any of 

these institutions, just as the founding 
fathers did not trust Congress. 

The next question that needs to be 
addressed is what should be the penal-
ties for speech that Ian S. Port deems to 
be "hateful:' There are three choices: 

l. Jail (this has worked very weU 
in Cuba). 

2. Cutting out the tongue of the 
transgressor (anyone who has read 
Ayn Rand's "Anthem" knows that this 
technique was effective for that soci-
ety.) 

3. Death. 
Anything less would not work, 

because Bryan J. Barton will be the 
one breaking the law of Ian S. Port. 
And those would be the only three 
ways to stop me. 

I live in the United States of 
America for a reason. And that rea-
son is, the founders of this coun-
try set up limits on governmental 

power. And limit ing the government's 
power of censorship was the First 
Amendment.

Great Sports Accompany Great Schools 
• JOHNSTON, from page 4 
administrators and Academic Senate 
members is that a Division I athletic 
program would require UCSD to 
recruit and admit a bunch of stupid, 
talented athletes. Such a change in 
admissions would hurt the school's 
average GPA, they say, and athletes 
would take admissions slots which 
should have gone to academically 
qualified applicants. I agree. 

IfUCSD wanted top-notch imme-
diate championship teams, then per-
haps this would be a problem. But to 
achieve quality athletic teams in the 
molds of Stanford and UC Berkeley, 
which don't admit dumb athletes and 
yet maintain competitive Division I 
teams, we would only admit athletes 
with intelligence on par with the stu-
dent body at large. 

This will probably not make us 
immediate champions, but as the 
program grows, it will attract more 

and better athletes with greater intel-
ligence, much like Stanford and 
Berkeley. This plan may not win 
us any championships in the near 
future, but it will allow us to sleep 
at night. 

Furthermore, Division I sports 
might actually bolster UCSD's aca-
demic reputation. Here's how: In 
politics, you're unlikely to vote for 
a candidate you've never heard of. 
Similarly, high school seniors aren't 
likely to apply to a school they've 
never heard of. Great sports teams 
give their schools exposure and 
because of that, attract the very stu-
dents UCSD is looking for: minori-
ties. lucrative out-of-state students 
and diverse international students. 

By sending UCSD teams to com-
pete in televised matches with schools 
in the northeast, southeast, and mid-
west, students who had never heard 
ofUCSD wiU research the school and 

I 
I 

apply to it because it maintains supe-
rior academics. The exposure granted 
by televised sports is quite possibly 
the most effective form of outreach 
available, drawing an untapped mar-
ket of intelligent students from across 
the country, perhaps resulting in an 
increased campus GPA. 

If we start now, move g.radual-
Iy step-by-step, and try to get the 
NCAA to work with us as they have 
in our move to Division II, then by 
the time they graduate, perhaps next 
year's freshmen will be able to see 
their Tritons defeat, say, the UCLA 
Bruins. And on that glorious day, 
millions across the country will open 
up their newspapers and read the 
headline: "Tritons Defeat Bruins." 
Their collective reaction at that time 
will be a perplexed: ·Who beat the 
Bruins?" But not the next time. Next 
time, they'll know our name. They'U 
know the UCSD Tritons.

A small stage in front of the room is brightly lit. 
but the rest of the room remains dark. As people 
filter in and take their seats, there is an electric antici-
pation as the audience awaits a night of poetry and 
music. As the OJ spins a record and hip-hop beats 
flow out of the speakers, Elevated begins. 

Put together by Collective Purpose, a group of 
performance artists, the open-mic event dubbed 
"Elevated" invites local poets, musicians and other 
performance artists to the stage to share their cre-
ative talent. The event brings together an eclectic 
mix of artists from all over Califomia where both 
veteran and first-time performers sign up for four 
minutes on stage. Whether they are performing a 
song or a poem, those who take the stage provoke 
the audience to think. One singer from TIjuana sings 
"Clandestino, - a song addressing the way the United 
States govemment refers to undocumented immi-
grants. Viet Mal, a member of Collective Purpose, 
screams out the word "free- as part of his piece. 
Another poet. who nervously Introduces herself as a 
first-time performer; speaks about beauty and nega-
tive perceptions of women. 

Elevated also featlRS more well-known poets, 
from Talaam Acey, one of the first to develop the 
art of spoken word, to Besskepp, a poet from los 
Angeles. 

The event only started last fall but has already 
drawn a loyal crowd. It begins at 8 p.m. the first and 
third Thursdays every month, but the venue quickly 
fills up and people are forced to crowd around in 
the back of the room. Both novice and master poets 
alike can be sure to find an engaging audience who 
will holler and cheer them on. 

Elevated is held at the Arts and Entertainment 
Center in North Park and costs $5 at the door.

Shoddy Defense Proves Costly In Loss 
• BASEBALL, (rom page 12 

"Even though [ picked up the 
win, I didn't have my best stuff;' 
Decker said. "But J did all right, kept 
us in the game and gave my offense 
a chance to win it, which they did. 

Cantele added an insurance run 
on a big fly to lead off the bottom of 
the fifth inning, bringing the UCSD 
lead to 5-2. The Tritons added two 
more runs in the sixth inning to 
increase its lead to five runs and the 
Toros responded with one run in the 
seventh and tacked on two more in 
the eighth to decrease UCSD's lead 
to 8-5. But the Toros would rally 
no more, as senior hurler Byron 
Grubman came in to record the 
final five outs and pick up his first 
save of the year. 

The Tritons had the chance to 
salvage a split in the series in the 
second game of the doubleheader, 
but three UCSD errors helped hand 

Dominguez Hills a 6- 1 victory and a 
3-1 series win. 

Freshman southpaw Jon Durket, 
who was coming off a win in his 
first collegiate start against Point 
Loma Nazarene University on April 
18, lasted only 3.1 innings in his sec-
ond start. giving up five hits, a walk 
and four runs. Only two of Durket's 
runs were earned, as Dominguez 
H ills took advantage of an error 
in the fourth inning to score three 
runs, two unearned, and break a 
I - I tie. 

The Toros would pad their 4· 
I lead with two more runs in the 
sixth inning off of two more UCSD 
errors to go up 6- 1. Dominguez 
Hills' senior starting pitcher Chris 
Borchers was masterful on the 
mound, picking up the complete 
game win, allowing only one run 
on Lhree hits and three walks while 
striking out eight. 

Decker said the Tritons have 
much to learn from the disappoint-
ing series. 

"We always have the expectation 
of winning the series or getting the 
four game sweep," Decker said. "But 
going out with one win makes us 
realize we need to play better base-
ball to make the playoffs:' 

The Tritons (26-21 overall, 15-
13 CCAA) will play Grand Canyon 
University on April 25 before fin-
ishing the rest of the season against 
CCAA rival teams. 

A four-game series against the 
San Francisco State University 
Gators (18 - 22 -2 overall , 8- 16- 1 
CCAA) starts on April 28 and the 
Tritons will host Cal State Monterey 
Bay (14-30 overall, 5-22 CCAA) in 
the final season series starting May 
5, so the Tritons will have plenty 
of opportunities to improve their 
league slanding. 

Tritons Face Challenge Against Bakersfield 
~ SOFTBALL, from page 12 
in the circle. 

Stanislaus continued its offensive 
charge in game two, taking a 1-0 
lead in the third off of a sacrifice fly. 
Stanislaus added another four runs 
in the fourth inning for a 5-0 lead. 

Fending off the shutout, the 
Tritons battled back in the bottom of 
the fourth, as sophomore third base-
man Jenny Maze picked up an RBI. 

The Warriors added two more 
runs in the slxth, but the Tritons 
would not go down without a fight, 
tallying two of their own in the last 
frame of the game. However, the 
effort was not enough for a come-
from-behind victory, as UCSD took 
the loss 7-3. 

Freshman pitcher Lauren 
Chastain took the loss for the 
Tritons, giving up five runs on 

four hits in just over three innings. 
Sophomore hurler Nicole Fullerton 
came in to relieve Chastain, giving 
up two runs on four hits with three 
strikeouts. 

Though there are only a handful 
of games left in the season and the 
Tritons have fallen to 20-22 over-
all and 8- 12 in league action, the 
team still has a chance at winning 
a spot at the NCAA Division II 
West Regional in May. The top eight 
teams in the region will participate. 
Going into this weekend, the Tritons 
were ranked No. lOin the West. 

Head coach Patti Gerckens was 
hopeful about the team's chances. 

"I am definitely optimistic about 
the rest of the season." she said. 
"However, we do have to step up and 
concentrate on consistent offense." 

The Tritons returned to action 

on April 23, playing host to No. 
lOCal State Bakersfield, which 
swept UCSD earlier in the season. 
Bakersfield is currently 36-8 on 
the season and holds first place in 
the Cali(orni .. Collegiate Athlelic 
Association with a league record 
of 13-3. 

UCSD will travel to Cal State 
Bernardino on April 26 to make 
up a game rained oul earlier this 
month. The Tritons then return to 
UCSD for their last home game, 
hosting Grand Canyon University 
on April 28. 

The Tritons conclude league play 
on the road, traveling to Rohnert 
Park, Calif., to face Sonoma State on 
May 5, and then to San Francisco to

Tritons Fall to Seventh Place After Series SOFTBALL 
DIPS BELOW 
.500 AGAIN 

UCSD's late-inning 
comeback falls short 
in one of its three 
losses against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 

By Rae! Enleen 
PORT EDITOR 

Following three losses in four 
games at the hands of the Cal State 
Dominguez Hills Toros, the UCSD 
baseball team has fallen to No.7 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, but will have the 
chance to ,move up in the standings 
and make a run at a playoff berth 
with eight of its next nine games 
against the two last-placed teams 
in the league. 

UCSD did not help its postsea-
son chances with its efforts against 
the unranked Toros, who passed 
the Tritons to become No.6 in the 
CCAA with their 3- 1 series win . 

In the first game of the series, 
held in Carson. Calif., on April 
20, the Tritons fought valiantly to 
corne back from a late 10-4 deficit 
to tie the game in the ninth inning, 
only to witness the Toros' own rally 
in the bottom of the ninth to win 
11 -10. 

The Tritons were down by six 
runs through seven innings, but a 
five -run rally in the eighth inning 
cut the Toro lead to 10-9. UCSD 
got the late runs on a bases-loaded, 
two-RBI single from junior third 
baseman Jonathan Erickson, a 
Dominguez Hills balk and a two-
RBI triple by senior centerfielder 
Damian Fante. 

The rally set up more late-
inning heroics, this time a game-
tying home run by sophomore 
designated hitter Scott Clement to 
lead off the top of the ninth inning. 
UCSD senior pitcher Ryan Leake 
then came in to hold off the Toros 
in the bottom of the ninth to send 

GREG DALE/GUARDIAN 
The UCSD baseball team's road woes continue, with the Tritons losing eight of their last J J away games. The most recent defeats came at 
the hands of Cal State Dominguez Hills, which has won J4 of its last J7games, including three offour against UCSD.

Track and Field Shatters Four School Records at Triton Invitational 

GREG DALE/GUARDIAN 
Senior Mike Cunningham placed first in the 400-meter dash and fifth in the 400 hurdles 
and was part of the men's 4X4OO relay team, which set a new UCSD record on April 22. 

Men's and women's 
relay teams set new 
marks in tough meet 
against D-I teams 
and Olympians.

In their final campaign before 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association conference track and 
field championships, the UCSD 
teams thrived among a throng of top-
tier college athletes and world -class 
track stars at the Triton Invitational 
on April 22 and 23. 

During the two-day affair, 
the Triton contingent showed its 
strength against Division-I powers 
such as San Diego State University 
and UC Riverside, as well as several 
Olympic hopefuls and medalists. 
Despite the intimidating competi-
tion, UCSD prevailed, setting four 
school records and achieving many 
national qualifying marks. 

In both the men's and women's 
4x400-meter relay, UCSD set new 
school marks, wit~ the men finishing 
first with a time of 3 minutes, 13.94 
seconds, and the women placing 
third in 3:48.39. The men's squad, 
composed of seniors Matt Borzage, 
Jon Patton and Mike Cunningham 
and sophomore Todd Bettisworth, 
edged out Cal State Northridge by 
almost I.S seconds and outran Cal 
State Fullerton by almost six sec-
onds. 

In individual competition, fresh-
man sensation Catherine Strouse set 

a new Triton record in the wom-
en's 3,000 steeplechase, finishing a 
respectable fourth overall with a 
time of 11 :20.94. 

Perhaps the men's most impres-
sive performance came in the 200 
from Patton, who improved his pre-
vious school record of 21.84 seconds 
to 21.81 seconds and placed fourth 
in the race. 

Patton also showed his talent in 
the 110 hurdles, finishing fifth with 
a time of 14.81. 

Patton's standout performanc-
es thoroughly pleased head coach 
Tony Salerno, who expects Patton's 
strengths to shine in the conference 
championship. 

"[ Patton is] a sen ior that's corne 
alive,» Salerno said. "He has a great 
deal of talent in the 200 and that's 
the place where we may use him in 
addition to his best event, the 400 
meters." 

The Tritons also received excep-
tional performances in the women's 
100 and 400 hurdles from sopho-
more Laiah Blue, who finished sec-
ond and fourth with times of 14.14 
and 1:02, respectively. Blue's 100 
time was her second-best personal 
finish, and should rank her highly 
going into nationals. 

Salerno said that Blue's shOWing 
proves that she can easily improve 
on her 10th-place finish at last year's 
national championships, and he did 
not discount the possibility that Blue 
could win the title. 

"[Blue] definitely has a chance at 
winning [the national title] if every-
thing goes well," Salerno said. "If 
you look at the results, she's ahead 
of a few of the world-class runners 

and all of the 0-1 runners." 
The successful outing allowed 

the Tritons to test their skills against 
top opponents, and it served as a 
practice run for the equally daunting 
CCAA conference championships, 
in which the Triton men placed 
third and the women captured the 
title last year. 

Expectations are running high 
in the Triton camp, as the teams 
hope to duplicate their previous suc-
cesses. 

According to Salerno, the CCCA 
is arguably the strongest 0 -11 con-
ference in the nation. 

"Five of our conference teams 
on the men's and women's sides fin -
ished in the top 25 nationally last 
year," Salerno said. "We're in pretty 
good company, and these teams can 
do quite a bit to damage us." 

Nonetheless, the team feels that 
the Triton Invitational helped it 
adequately prepare for the upcom-
ing battle. 

"We're in a fortunate situation 
where we can test our people against 
some of the best in the world." 
Salerno said. "It gives us a lot of 
confidence that we can be success-
ful, and I think we're feeling pretty 
good right now." 

UCSD will host the CCAA 
conference championships May 4 
through 6, and the familiar sur-
roundings should prove to be ben-
eficial for the the Tritons. 

Following the championships, 
the Tritons will hone their skills at 
the Occidental Invitational on May 
13, and then head to Emporia, Kan., 
for the NCAA Division-II National 
Championships. J
