U N I V E R S I T Y  O F  C A L I F O R N I A ,  S A N  D I E G O

On Oct. 16, UCSD underwent 
an “active shooter drill” in which 
campus emergency personnel role-
played a scenario similar to the 
shootings that occurred at Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute and State 

University in April. UCSD secu-
rity officials are calling the campus’ 
response a success, with the excep-
tion of some inter-department com-
munication problems that may have 
delayed emergency response time. 

San Diego police and fire depart-
ments joined campus officers to 
assist in the activity, as well as vol-
unteers playing the roles of the 
victims.

An area of UCSD School of 
Medicine between the Leichtag 
building and the Biomedical 
Library was cordoned off to foot 
traffic as the drill was being con-
ducted. A great number of Campus 

Emergency Response Team mem-
bers wearing yellow vests could be 
seen in the area.  

The purpose of the drill was to 
test how the campus would be able 
to handle a situation similar to the 
Virginia Tech shootings that killed 
33 students and staff members.

“Basically, we do it to expose 
our weaknesses,” said Paul Mueller, 
a public information officer with 
UCSD communications. “We’re try-
ing to improve our program all the 
time.”  

The S.W.A.T. officer who play-

This year’s Sun God festival could be subject to a 
significant logistical overhaul — including potential 
changes to the event’s date, location, concert access 
and alcohol sales policy — if recommendations made 
in a recent planning report are approved by the A.S. 
Programming and University Events offices.

The Oct. 16 report analyzed health, safety and mis-
cellaneous complaints made by faculty and vendors 
after last year’s festival, and provided recommenda-
tions for how Sun God 2008 should be changed to 
alleviate the issues.

UEO Director Martin Wollesen said that the 
event’s programmers are constantly looking for ways 
to improve the festival’s execution, but that last year’s 
25th anniversary of Sun God spurred them to charter 
a comprehensive report for future planning.

“We always go through a debrief process,” Wollesen 
said. “This year we sort of said, ‘Let’s use this year, since 
it’s been 25 years, to make sure that when we debrief, 

we have a document about that debrief.’ We want to, as 
a campus, think globally and widely about this event.”

Wollesen and A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Programming Kevin Highland organized seven meet-
ings with the heads of numerous campus departments, 
including the UCSD Police Department, the Office 
of Student Policies and Judicial Affairs, the Office of 
Safety, Health and Security, Parking and Transportation 
Services and the council of college deans. UEO and 
A.S. Programming then either endorsed, chose not to 
endorse or abstained from endorsing the recommen-
dations listed in the 22-page report.

An endorsement does not guarantee that the 
recommendation will ultimately be implemented, 
Wollesen said, as many circumstances that make 
certain options seem prudent are in a constant state of 
flux. Similarly, decisions not endorsed by the council 
or UEO are also not considered final.

“We’re not predetermining anything,” he said. “It 

may change over time.”
Many of the issues addressed in the report per-

tain directly to student safety, which Wollesen said is 
always a primary concern of Sun God programmers. 
Last year, 355 people — 197 students and 158 nonaf-
filiates — were arrested at Sun God. Approximately 97 
percent of the arrests were alcohol related, the report 
said.

In response to those statistics, the report offered 
four recommendations: decreasing the number of 
nonaffiliate tickets sold, discontinuing them entirely, 
linking them to student IDs for easier tracking and 
stopping the sale of tickets on the day of the event. 
Both UEO and A.S. Programming abstained on the

New Bill Puts Executive 
Salaries Out in the Open

By Reza Farazmand
Senior Staff Writer

In an effort to increase financial 
transparency within California’s 
public university administrations, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed 
a bill last week that will require any 
university decisions on executive 
pay to be made at public meetings.

Senate Bill 190, the Higher 
E du c at i on  G ove r n an c e 
Accountability Act, will affect both 
the UC and CSU systems. Authored 
by state Sen. Leland Yee (D-San 
Francisco), the bill’s primary pur-
pose is to shed light on proceedings 
pertaining to executive compensa-
tion when they occur within meet-
ings of the UC Board of Regents 
and the CSU Board of Trustees. 

According to the bill, univer-
sity officials are now required to 
vote on all executive compensa-
tion packages in an open session of 
a subcommittee and a full board. 
Additionally, the bill requires full 
disclosure of any compensation 
package, along with an accompa-
nying reasoning for the package 

and public comment on the item at 
hand. SB 190 also closes a loophole 
that allowed the UC regents and the 
trustees to sidestep state-mandated 
open meetings law. 

The UC Office of the President 
responded to the passage of SB 
190 by citing the implementation 
of similar university policy regula-
tions last year.

“This legislation aligns with and 
supports the practice we put in 
place over a year ago that requires 
all compensation for UC senior 
managers to be approved in public,”

With additional indoor seating and 
a fresh coat of paint, the Grove Caffe 
is nearly ready to reopen its doors, 
though an exact date is still uncertain. 
Former RIMAC 101 Cafe Concessions 
Manager Cleveland Thomas will now 
manage the A.S. enterprise, which was 
under threat of closure last year due to 
a longstanding $17,000 debt. 

Grove Student Manager Randell

College Textbook 
Affordability Act Vetoed
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 

vetoed Senate Bill 832, which would 
have attempted to lower the costs 
of textbooks by requiring that pub-
lishers disclose price information to 
professors at the time of sale.

“This bill focuses strictly on text-
book publisher policies and fails 
to recognize that the affordability 
of textbooks is a shared responsi-
bility among publishers, college 
bookstores and faculty members,”  
Schwarzenegger said in his veto 
message.  

However, when prices are not 
revealed during sale transactions, 
publishers have the optional tenden-
cy to offer more expensive products, 
said Emily Rusch, a California Public 
Interest Research Group advocate.  

The governor instead signed 
Assembly Bill 1548, which requires 
publishers to disclose the price when 
asked, rather than during sales meet-
ings.  

“A.B. 1548 does nothing to cor-
rect the market imbalance,” Rusch 
said.  “We hope that over time, 
the governor rethinks his position 
and reconsiders similar efforts in the 
future.”

According to a study conducted 
by Public Interest Research Groups, 
77 percent of faculty report that pub-
lishers rarely or never report the price 
of a book during sales transactions.  
When professors directly asked for 
the price during a sales meeting, 
only 38 percent of publishers would 
disclose the price.  

The average student spends 
about $900 per year on textbooks, 
which equates to nearly 20 percent 

of tuition and fees at a four-year pub-
lic institution, according to a report 
from the state PIRGs.  

 
Students Take Top Rank in 

Innovation Contest
A team of UCSD students won first 

prize and $5,000 in last weekend’s 
Qualcomm Innovator Challenge, 
envisioning a portable device that 
allows an individual to watch televi-
sion while doing homework.

BookPal, designed by David 
Wong, David Swartz, Andrew Smith 
and Aaron Swartz, also enables an 
individual to take digital notes, read 
through several textbooks simulta-
neously and access the Internet.  
When turned on its side, BookPal 
can be used for typing as if it were 
a laptop.  

The four freshmen called them-
selves the Voracious Savants, and 
were one of 17 teams that presented  
designs in the event, which was 
organized by the Jacobs School of 
Engineering’s Corporate Affiliates 
Program and Qualcomm.

Two of the students are mechani-
cal engineering majors, one is an 
electrical engineering major and the 
fourth student is undeclared.  

Second prize and $3,000 was 
awarded to another all-freshman  
team named Athena.  The four bioen-
gineering majors designed a portable 
electronic device with a screen that 
rolls up when not in use.  

Greek Fire, a team of five seniors, 
took third prize and $2,000 with a 
digital clipboard called MediBoard, 
used to help doctors and other health 
care professionals work together 
within the same hospital and across 
the world.

acted the shooter role began his mock 
rampage near the student services 
area, and left two individuals as mock 
victims there. Then, at about 10 a.m., 
he made his way down to the medi-
cal school and entered the Leitchtag 
building, which the medical school 
had agreed to provide for the drill.  

According to UCSD Police Lt. 
David Rose, the drill’s purpose was 
to evaluate how responders would 
react to a real crisis. Police then had 
to figure out where the shooter had 
gone after the initial shooting.

After they received reports that he 
was around the medical complex and 
had entered Leitchtag, police guarded 
the exits to the building as volunteers 
came out with their hands up. They 
were then frisked by police, just as 
they would be in a real event. Some 
of the people exiting the building 
pretended to be wounded.  

There were nine mock victims in 
total: two on Library Walk and seven 
in the Leitchtag building.  The mock 
victims had fake wounds known as 
“moulage” wounds, with the excep-
tions of the two Library Walk victims 
so people on campus would not be 
alarmed. 

The victims were then put on 
stretchers and taken to Thornton 
Hospital by the San Diego Fire 
Department, enabling the hospital to 
practice receiving mass casualties.  

In order to role-play having to 
take down a potential shooter, sev-
eral armed police officers entered the 
building with their guns drawn. At 
approximately 10:08 a.m., two blanks 
were fired as a way for the person role 
playing the shooter to signal to police 
that he was inside the building. At

New Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue delivered some grandmotherly advice to 
A.S. councilmembers yesterday evening 
before their meeting transitioned into a 
contentious debate about the purchase 
of objectionable foam fingers by “elite 
spirit crew” Triton Tide.

After extolling the virtues of 
informed advocacy, coalition building 
and learning from mistakes, Rue field-
ed questions from 
councilmembers.

In response to 
a question from 
A.S. President 
Marco Murillo, 
Rue explained her 
philosophy about 
campuswide com-
munity building. 
Her vision of community consisted of 
three levels — individual friendship, 
participation in student organizations 
and all-campus identity.

Rue challenged the council to con-
tinue supporting student organizations 
that serve her second level of com-
munity, while at the same time making 
their members feel that they’re a part of 
a larger UCSD community.

“Most of our sense of membership 
and belonging comes from that mediat-
ing group,” Rue said of student organi-
zations. “I think if we’re doing it well … 
membership in those groups also feels 
like membership at UCSD.”

Rue also discussed long-term plans 
to bolster campuswide community 
by building more on-campus hous-
ing, including special-interest housing 
(potentially for the Greek community).

After an amicable conversation with 
Rue, the council addressed a controver-
sial funding request during committee 
reports.

A $4,000 funding request for Triton 
Tide initially received support from 
Triton Tide President and John Muir 

College Council Chair Dave Payne and 
All-Campus Senator Meghan Clair.

But after Thurgood Marshall College 
Senator Kyle Samia pressed for more 
concrete details about how Triton Tide 
planned to use the funding, Associate 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Long Pham led the charge against the 
request.

“Let’s have a real discussion about 
why they’re asking,” Pham said. “Money 

was spent to buy 
unacceptable sexu-
ally offensive foam 
fingers.”

At the begin-
ning of the quarter, 
Triton Tide worked 
with the council 
to use $2,000 of 
last year’s unspent 

money to buy foam fingers.
The foam fingers, meant to repre-

sent tridents, also resembled a sexu-
ally suggestive hand gesture commonly 
referred to as the “shocker.”

According to Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Sarah Chang, 
a miscommunication between A.S. offi-
cers and Payne prevented anyone from 
proofing one of the foam fingers before 
they were manufactured.

The $4,000 request was meant to 
cover Triton Tide’s loss as well as pro-
vide an additional $2,000 for more mer-
chandise.

“I think the council lost a lot of 
accountability,” Pham said of the inci-
dent. “We’re willing to overlook that 
even though they wasted $2,000 of stu-
dent fees?”

Luke Pulaski, representing the 
Interfraternity Council, brought the 
meeting full circle when he revisted 
Rue’s teaching of forgiving mistakes in 
defense of Triton Tide’s foam finger 
fiasco. Minutes later the request passed 
with a 13-9-3 vote, ending the night’s 
heated discussion.

approximately 10:15 a.m. police confirmed 
that the two gunmen — it was later revealed 
that there was more than one mock shooter 
— had been taken into custody, and later, 
according to the scenario, confirmed to be 
“dead.”  

Rose said a large part of the exercise was 
to see how well campus police would be able 
to work in tandem with San Diego police 
in the event of an emer-
gency. However, he noted 
that one of the areas in 
need of improvement was 
the integration of separate 
radio systems of campus 
police officers and San 
Diego police. 

He said he was par-
ticularly impressed with 
the performance of CERT 
members who secured the 
perimeter of the drill site 
and helped triage victims. 

Despite these initial 
observations, Rose said that the drill needed 
to be further analyzed. 

During the drill, RIMAC Arena was des-
ignated to be the “reunification center.” In the 
event of a real shooting, the function of the 
location would be to update people worried 
about the event and to have a place for people 
to reunite with loved ones who had not been 
injured. 

At a post-event debriefing barbeque, 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox was the first to 
address the crowd.

“This was an important experience for all 

of us,” she said. “The safety of the students, 
staff and faculty are of paramount impor-
tance at this institution.”

Fox also said that this drill would not be 
the last that the campus would hold, and that 
such exercises are only one way to prepare for 
emergencies.

She also reminded the crowd about the 
new blue emergency towers on campus, 
which were tested during the course of the 

drill. The towers include 
a handset in the back that 
police can use to provide 
live broadcasts to people 
during an emergency, as 
well as loudspeakers and 
cameras.  

Emergency Services 
Manager Phillip Van Saun 
called the event an “out-
standing success.”

“I’m surprised at how 
well things went,” he said.

In particular he 
expressed gratitude for 

Fox’s help, noting that her support made the 
drill possible. Van Saun has conducted other 
emergency drills in the past, including an 
earthquake drill in 2005. 

Van Saun said that although other cam-
puses have conducted similar shooter drills, 
UCSD’s was particularly large in scale.

“The goal is to make sure that we’ve done 
the most we can to take care of students, staff 
and faculty,” he said.

estimated date for reopening the eatery, mainly 
because of the ongoing Student Center construc-
tion that negatively affects much of the area’s traffic 
flow, though they hope to open the Grove later 
this quarter.

“Last time I spoke with [Thomas], he men-
tioned that he would like to open the Grove 
next Monday,” Baltazar said in an e-mail. “If he’s 
changed his mind then he has yet to inform me … 
it’s definitely doable seeing as I just finished writing 
the schedule for next week.”

The council’s decision at the end of last Spring 
Quarter to hire a nonstudent manager was conten-
tious as Grove employees want to emphasize the 
importance of keeping the cafe student-run. 

“I am unsure as to wheth-
er [Thomas] will uproot the 
Grove from its financial defi-
cits without meddling with its 
culture and heritage,” Baltazar 
said. “I hope for the best but I 
feel the worst to come.”

Debate broke out regard-
ing the enterprise’s future 
when Crafts Center Director 
and former partial Grove 
owner Ron Carlson liquidated 
his share of the struggling eat-
ery. A.S. councilmembers and 
Grove employees discussed 
a number of options, includ-
ing a potential transition from its status as an 
A.S. enterprise to a co-op or the possibility of a 
managing partnership with the Rady School of 
Management.

Though Grove employees met with Food Co-
op members in the spring, the cafe’s standing 
as an A.S. enterprise impedes it from any such 
transition.

According to Baltazar, Grove employees cor-
responded with the Rady School for months, but 
it was the A.S. Council that pulled the plug on the 
proposed partnership in favor of hiring an outside 
manager.

“In my opinion, this potential partnership was 
only considered during the school year to appease 
the students,” Baltazar said. “Once the staff and 
school body left for summer break, [A.S. coun-
cilmembers] conveniently choose the option of 
hiring a full-time manager without a student body 
to oppose their decision.”

At its last meeting of the 2006-07 academ-
ic year, councilmembers passed legislation to 
approve the creation of a Grove manager posi-
tion. The A.S. Council formed a hiring commit-
tee to give input into the selection process. The 
five-person team included Baltazar, Maxwell and 
A.S. President Marco Murillo, but the final deci-
sion was made by Student Life Business Office 
Manager John Hughes. 

“The hiring of a new manager was the path we 
decided upon because we realize the Grove needs 
stable management,” Maxwell said in an e-mail. 
“Through the talks we had with the Rady School 
it became evident that they could not provide the 
full-time management the Grove needed if it were 
to survive as an enterprise.”

To integrate the new 
manager into the cafe’s struc-
ture, employees will report 
to Thomas, who will then 
report to the student servic-
es business director — the 
position to which managers 
of the other A.S. enterprises 
report — and meet with 
Maxwell each week. 

The council is also form-
ing an advisory committee 
composed of employees and 
councilmembers that will 
meet weekly to review prof-
its, losses and major issues 

facing the Grove.
Both Maxwell and Baltazar emphasized a lack 

of communication between the council and its 
enterprise last year, and these changes are efforts 
to prevent such a breakdown in the future.

In addition to boosting publicity, Thomas said 
he hopes to pull the Grove out of debt by introduc-
ing new food options, reorganizing procedures to 
make them more cost-effective, helping to train 
and guide students and focusing on solid day-to-
day business practices. He is currently looking to 
hire between 15 and 20 new workers, in addition 
to the nine returning employees.

“[We want] to give the student employees 
and customers a unique, hipster vibe and serene 
atmosphere where they can learn about business,” 
Thomas said.

UCOP spokesman Paul Schwartz 
said in an e-mail. 

According to Adam Keigwin, 
Yee’s communications director, 
further codification of these regu-
lations in the form of state law 
was necessary to ensure that such 
accountability remains a priority. 

“What they’ve implemented is 
just policy, and at any time, theo-
retically, they could go back and 
change that pol-
icy, and this law 
will prevent that 
from happen-
ing,” Keigwin 
said. “While we’re 
glad they’ve made 
some of those 
changes, we don’t 
want changes in 
leadership or 
changes in the 
board [of regents] 
to change that 
policy.” 

Last year, both university sys-
tems faced criticism when news-
paper reports revealed a number 
of undisclosed compensation perks 
that were awarded to top execu-
tives without public knowledge. 
According to Keigwin, SB 190 
serves as a way for the universities 
to re-establish legitimacy and pub-
lic confidence. 

“The board of regents violat-
ed the public trust by approving 
exorbitant compensation packages 
behind closed doors,” Keigwin said. 

“SB 190 will hopefully allow us to 
regain that trust. At the end of the 
day this is the taxpayers’ money, 
this is the students’ money, and the 
students and the taxpayers deserve 
to know how this money is being 
spent.” 

Although SB 190 does not offi-
cially become law until January 
2008, the state Senate has requested 
that universities begin honoring the 
new regulations without delay.

“There’s no 
reason they 
need to wait 
until January to 
implement the 
bill, especially 
in light of the 
fact that they’ve 
started their 
search for the 
new president, 
so the public 
should know 
what’s going on 
there,” Keigwin 

said. 
First introduced in February 

and co-authored by Assemblyman 
Anthony Portantino (D-Pasadena), 
SB 190 was amended several times 
before receiving unanimous approv-
al by the state Senate last month.

A similar proposal, Assembly 
Bill 775, was rejected by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee last 
year.

first possibility — meaning it will be 
discussed and decided upon at a later 
date — but the programming depart-
ment rejected the idea of limiting the 
concert solely to UCSD students.

“The student body as a whole is very 
proud of the Sun God festival,” it said 
in the report. “We want students to be 
able to welcome friends and family to 
their campus, and together enjoy this 
extraordinary event.”

UEO abstained from endorsing the 
issue, while neither side objected to the 
other two alternatives. The program-
ming department did not endorse a 
similar recommendation to limit nonaf-
filiate attendance: changing the festival’s 
date to a Saturday.

The report also cited difficulties 
with crowd control at entrances and 
exits during the evening concert as a 
major impediment to student safety, 
which echoes a second criticism that 
police and emergency personnel are 
often blocked from moving quickly 
around campus by student organiza-
tion booths and other events.

Both the council and UEO abstained 
on recommendations to consolidate 
the event layout to a single site or 
shorten the number of festival hours, 
but did not object to stricter oversight 
of the annual Junk Yard Derby, which 
takes place on Peterson Hill. The report 
said that the derby limited emergency 
access, and that the three-day dura-

tion made the event burdensome to 
supervise.

Ultimately, both offices approved a 
recommendation to revise the derby’s 
safety standards, including a pre-event 
run-through of the vehicles on a similar 
course.

UCSD programmer analyst and 
derby participant Wayde Gilliam said 
that the derby is generally safe for par-
ticipants, but that he understands why 
there may have been some concerns 
posed by festival coordinators.

“I’m not exactly sure how they 
would do a pre-check of the vehicles,” 
Gilliam said. “I think it’s a case-by-case 
type of concern with different types of 
vehicles.”

Wollesen said that another focus of 
the report is to de-emphasize the con-
nection between the festival and alcohol 
consumption among students.

“I think what we’re really interested 
in doing is creating an event about 
the UCSD community,” he said. “If the 
change is that students view it as a com-
munity event as opposed to a drinking 
event, that’s an okay change.”

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said at 
a Sept. 26 meeting that last year’s Sun 
God was particularly problematic in 
regard to ensuring campus safety.

“We almost lost some kids last year,” 
she said. “So something is going to have 
to be done. We’re going to have to elicit 
support from the student body on how 
to make it safe but still fun. We have so 

few traditions that you don’t want to 
do away with it, but you would like to 
make it safe.”

Wollesen said he had not heard 
about that particular incident, but that 
his office is aware of the problems asso-
ciated with the festival’s image as a day 
of heavy drinking.

“We wouldn’t be surprised that 
binge drinking and alcohol abuse are 
real issues at Sun God,” he said.

Several suggestions in the report 
specifically addressed alcohol-related 
problems, including a one-day ban 
on alcohol sales at university venues. 
Presently, neither UEO or the A.S. 
Council has objected to that provi-
sion.

The two offices are currently orga-
nizing public Sun God planning meet-
ings beginning later this month. 

A steering committee consisting of 
representatives from the UCSD Police 
Department, the six colleges, Student 
Health Services, the Office of Risk 
Management, event facilities and UEO 
will be charged to advise the program-
ming office on festival planning and 
implementation.

Highland emphasized that no 
changes to the festival have yet been 
implemented.

“[The report] contains no concrete 
actions on our part,” he said.

Forget everything you know about politics for a second. Forget about the agendas, 
the scandals and the parties. Forget 
about who’s an elephant, an ass or a 
fence-sitter. 

In my world there are three kinds 

of political people: There are the 
confident, bordering on headstrong; 
there are the apathetic; and then 
there are those like me — yearning 
to boldly declare my convictions 
and join my respective groupies, but 
still skeptical about where I stand. 
And more importantly, with whom. 

Since early January, when the 

2008 presidential candidates began 
declaring their intent to run for 
office, America’s political arena 
has been ablaze with excitement. 
Everywhere I turn there is a bud-
ding campaign issue, a fresh slogan, 
a seductive promise. 

Through it all, I’ve watched 
eagerly as the presidential candi-
dates gathered at the debates, each 
armed with a bag of tricks, ready 
to throw the best punch for a shot 
at victory. But amid the bustle of 
campaign activity and the hope of 
impending political reform, I must 
admit: I’m lost. The last nine months 
have turned me into a political wall-
flower — something with which I’m 
entirely unfamiliar.  

When President George W. Bush

I was crushed. Despite desperately

Admin’s Sun God Overhaul Would Be Overkill

Take Heed, Warren Voters: Old Fees Should Die Hard

The personality of Sun God — the day’s very core — is intangibly charming. God will-
ing, the event’s haloed buzz will be 
as vibrant, buoyant and alive in five 
years as it is today. The hope is to see 
tradition relived: We were all fountain 
frolickers, astrojumpers or tailgaters at 
one point in our Triton lives. Sun God 
breeds campus kinship.A gushy senti-
ment?  Sure. A crucial part of collegiate 
life?  Hell yes.

A phalanx of administrative depart-
ments were tasked with the “re-evalu-
ation” of Sun God, the most specific 
— and least-alarming — term that the 
authors of Sun God 2008 Planning 
Report are using to define their work. 

Only a tweaking, they say, is needed 
to make Sun God a safer, smoother and 
more efficient undertaking. Students 
rarely realize the colossal size of the 
day-long event, which draws more 
than just big-name musicians to cam-
pus; Sun God brings with it a whole lot 
of non-UCSD students, event sponsors 
and dollar power. From that stand-
point, it is logical to assess the event’s 
largest faults before they reach their 
tipping point. Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox’s comments on Sun God earlier 
this year were also cautious; she said 
she hoped to boost “safety” while pre-
serving the event’s spirit. There isn’t a 
sea change in the works here, admin-
istrators say, only fine-tuned adjust-
ments for security’s sake.

But the report’s gaping breadth sug-
gests otherwise. The 22-page study 
delves into Sun God’s innards,  recom-
mending a flurry of “improvements”: 
Tighter controls over the Junkyard 
Derby, heightened security at student-

heavy locations, a keener eye on all 
things alcohol-related and heavier 
oversight of Round Table Pizza are 
just a few of the report’s suggestions. 
The execution is reminiscent of the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
Report, which tackled another heavily 
multi-faceted issue: student life. But 
nebulous questions like “what’s wrong 
with student life?” produce a need for 
exhaustive reassessment; events like 
Sun God should have specific prob-
lems to solve.

A Triton’s degree of alarm should be 
based on this report’s status: How many 
of these “suggestions” will actually be 
implemented? The study will birth a 
number of offshoot committees made 
of relevant “campus partners,” ranging 
from the UCSD Police Department to 
Student Health Services. If those com-
mittees hold fast to A.S. Programming-
endorsed proposals, Sun God is in for 
a sweeping makeover. (Editor’s note: In 
the report, any noncontested recom-
mendation is deemed as supported by 
programming officials.)

That’s not to say the programming 
department isn’t aligned with students’ 
mindsets. The office rightfully fights 
the report’s most absurd proposals, 
which include terminating nonaffiliate 
ticket sales and moving the concert to 
a Saturday. They smartly support the 
commonsense advisements, including 
prior testing of ticket-related equip-
ment and increasing the number of 
radios for event staff.

But there are still many parts of the 
report that will undoubtedly cramp 
a student’s Sun God experience. For 
example, the report’s authors recom-
mend a shorter transition between 

daytime and nighttime activities (A.S. 
Programming abstained from com-
menting on that advice). The authors 
cited safety concerns as their moti-
vation, saying that students occupy 
themselves during that time with such 
unsavory activities as “partying” and 
“playing in the fountain.” God forbid.

If protecting students were the ini-
tial goal, wouldn’t security alterations 
— and that alone — be enough to 
appease worried administrators? Why 
the wide, scattershot approach to Sun 
God assessment?

As they address these recom-
mendations, the steering committees 
should first draw the line between 
safety and boredom. Maintaining 
the event’s all-campus, free-
spirited ambiance should 
be quintessential when con-
sidering any change to Sun 
God.

This progress of this 
issue will prove divisive: 
Administrators will push every 
safety concern and Sun God 
devotees will push back. 
Middle ground will be 
hard to find. Students 
should watch closely: 
This is your event, 

so treat it as such. Administrators will 
undoubtedly cut up, divide and trans-
form the event if there is no push for 
student input.

In many ways, Sun God is UCSD. 
That single day embodies this universi-
ty’s most colorful parts — all-out hijinks, 
fun and, most importantly, camara-
derie. As such, the commit-
tees should 
handle the 

report with kid gloves when consider-
ing potential changes. Hopefully, the 
report’s net effect yields modifications 
that establish a safer environment for a 
better-run concert, but only minimally 
impact the event’s longstanding trade-
mark of being the ultimate experience 
for the student community .

Three years after the approval of its first activity fee, Earl Warren College is out again with its hat in hand, asking students to front supposed 
funding deficiencies. In 2004, a college referendum 
virtually tripled the amount of money available to the 
Warren College Student Council. This year, the council 
would reap an additional $26,000 if students approve 
the fee hike.

The money will be targeted mainly for program-
ming use, Warren College Parliamentarian Dan Palay 
says, which includes Warren Live! and its events board. 
At $14,400, the latter gobbles up the largest chunk of 
the college’s budget. Inflation is Palay’s explanation 
for the referendum; 2004’s $4-per-quarter charge has 
apparently grown stale in three years, so it’s back to 
students to carry the fiscal weight. It’s doubtful that 
an extra $3 per quarter is financially unbearable for 

any student, but it’s also doubtful that three years of 
inflation have completely depleted the college’s funds. 
Construction and gas costs are the most vulnerable to 
inflation, not concerts. The regular rate of inflation is at 
most a 3- to 4-percent increase each year, not the over 
50-percent increase that the referendum would entail.

Another of Palay’s cited reasons: Warren currently 
charges the lowest per-student activity fee of UCSD’s 
six colleges. However, the college also boasts the 
campus’ largest enrollment figures. It’s the principle 
that matters most here: What other avenues of budget 
tightening have been explored? What extra fat could 
have been sliced off before asking students to shoulder 
another fee hike? 

It’s a shame that WCSC was too myopic in vision to 
expect these financial problems and settle them three 
years ago with the original referendum.



THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

wanting to partake in the election, 
at the time I was still a year shy of 
voting age. And as such was forced 
to stand by indefensibly as he mirac-
ulously won another term. I spent 
the next three years itching to vote 
so I could bring some fresh light to 
a dismal administration. 

To say that I was anxious for the 
primaries and the commencement 
of another election season would be 
a gross understatement. But now, as 
America fast approaches the wake 
of what many — demonstrated by 
poll after poll —  consider the worst 
presidency in American history, my 
feelings about voting have surpris-
ingly changed. It’s no longer the 
patriotic form of participation I 
imagined, but rather an ominous 
responsibility I feel ill-equipped to 
assume. 

Looking at this bleak platform 
of candidates, I’m determined, and 
almost frantic, to discover a gem 
among them and attach myself to 
that particular presidential hopeful. 
But despite my efforts to look past 
each candidate’s quirks and short-
comings, not one has earned my 
affection. 

In fact, the more I study their 
campaigns, the more disenchanted I 
become with their messages, and the 
more I come to understand those 
urging former Vice President Al 
Gore to run for office. 

Take, for example, democratic 
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Born to a Methodist family in 
Illinois, the cutthroat New York 
senator promises to put up a defi-
nite fight, but her rough edges make 
her an unrelateable candidate that is 
hard to pin down. 

On the one hand, her appar-
ent ferocity is commendable and 
appealing, but she often appears to 
shrink from convictions after they 
become troublesome. Her infamous 
fight for health care reform as for-
mer first lady and her prior sup-
port for the Iraq War resolution are 
perfect examples; when popularity 
dwindled on both issues, Clinton 
quickly jumped ship. 

For candidate Sen. Barack 
Obama (D-Ill.), the problem is not 
so much a dubious track record, but 
rather, the absence of one. Should I 

take his opposition to the Iraq War, 
his efforts to end genocide in Darfur 
and his promise to fill the cracks 
in America’s education system as 
sufficient evidence of his ability? 
Should I vote for him in spite of his 
inexperience or because of it?

Then there is the typical array 
of classic republican candidates to 
choose from, all committed to tax 
cuts, scandals, the war on terror-
ism, revamping — or  abolishing 
— Social Security and patrolling the 
border. Given my liberal tendencies, 
this type of political conservativism 

just doesn’t appeal to me. 
There is, however, one “republi-

can” who does stand out — hopeless  
Ron Paul. Apart from his outspo-
ken noninterventionist beliefs, his 
commitment to freedom and his 
endorsement of free trade, which 
alone might be enough to lure me 
in, many of Paul’s proposed rem-
edies are so far-fetched you almost 
wonder if he’s serious. 

For instance, he advocates the 
abolition of the Federal Reserve, 
the Internal Revenue Service, the 
Department of Education, the 
Department of Homeland Security, 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Administration and the Department 
of Energy. 

So while he may call himself a 
republican, this former libertarian 
has no more in common with the 
GOP than Clinton does. Despite 
his grandpa-like charisma, the gig-
gling and the mockery Paul has 
received from fellow republicans 
indicate it’s unlikely he will earn his 
party’s nomination. I’m left wonder-
ing whether he’s worth my time at 
all, or just a lost cause in this politi-
cal rat race. 

At this point it’s impossible to 
tell. 

Needless to say I can’t promise 
that I know who I’ll be voting come 
primaries. In fact, I find myself 
wishing I were more of an extrem-
ist — more like the confident or 
the apathetic, for whom the choice 
is easy. For now though, I’ll go on 
politically confused as I hash out the 
pros and cons of each presidential 
wannabe. 

I can, however, promise you one 
thing — no matter who I pick, my 
choice will be an educated one.

FUTURE South Serves Up a Swap 
Meet, To Go

I t’s a rough life down here, under this premature hunchback and pair of eardrum-battering headphones. 
Unlike my romantic and old-fashioned 
high-school self, who satiated her sonic 
appetite with frequent trips to Amoeba 
Music  — or even (gasp!) by participat-
ing in the occasional law-defying swap 
— most of my musical discovery now 
takes place in the dark, as the moon 
rolls over, staring into a window-clut-
tered laptop screen.

Yet now more than ever, I feel like a 
part of it all — grounded to my day by 
a phenomenon nostalgically known as 
the mixtape. In fact, with these fancy 
new mixtapes in queue, I can even 
begin to tap a scene that rages thou-
sands of miles across the country, where 

a movement in accessibility is going 
down that has reshaped my cultural 
identity and swallowed my hard drive 
whole. And I don’t even have to show 
my white-girl mug on an Atlanta street 
corner to cop ’em — just sift through 
worlds of clutter-free (though sadly not 
popup-free) stacks, all stored on a glori-
ous metro-map of Internet stops, while 
never once leaving my very own couch 
dent — and sans dark-alley rapists. 

There are other locales with similar 
mixtape customs, like the rising UK 
garage/grime scene and waning Bay 
Area hyphy cult, but they all got noth-
ing on the Dirty South (including the 
Southeast, up to the Carolinas), whose 
hip-hop soldiers are unbeatable in out-
put. DJ Chuck T, Charleston producer 
with a side-penchant for raunchy neo-
soul — his series Sexxxplicit R&B is cur-
rently on its 21st volume — highlights 
rowdy lesser-knowns on The New South 
Rides With Me and competitive bigtim-
ers on the now 44-volume Down South 
Slangin’. And then, of course, there’s 
DJ Drama, basking in the aftermath of 
his notorious RIAA arrest (copyright 
infringement? More like free public-
ity), who hosts the South’s entire royal 
court on his ridiculous mass of stately, 
now-classic beats, borrowing from an 
untraceable amount of sample-sources 
with only one thing in common: no 
consent required.

Drama’s latest mixtape previews 
his first official studio album, due in 
December. Gangsta Grillz 17 makes 
it hard to believe this much precious 
material could be slipping through the 
cracks, on all the comps we didn’t hear 
— though much of it is seized from 
elsewhere. Even top hip-hop innova-
tors like André 3000 begin to throw 
around been-dones like “Foreman grill” 
and “study a broad,” their verses more 
relaxed in this unregulated creative 
mecca, free from the looming shadows 
of nonblogger critique, the copyright 
symbol and official label stamp.

That’s what the whole mixtape con-
cept is about: keeping shit alive, throw-
ing it around a few times before it sticks 
just right. Everyone tributes everyone 
else — and while sometimes this back-
fires or chases its tail, it eventually gives 
way to a natural evolution. Hip-hop, 
now the most advanced form of col-
lage to date (unlike mixtape cover-
art, a hilarious Photoshop layerfest of 
ghetto Word Art and up-tilted chins) 
is achieving in its Internet revolution 
what so many literary and visual move-
ments wish they could.

Straighter 
   Than Narrow

T he furthest evolution of the spaceship will be a mere bubble encasement made to travel faster than the speed of light, with negligible wind resistance. Unlike predecessors Kid A and O.K. 
Computer, this incarnation would not require complicat-
ed technology or electronics to propel itself. Anything 
unnecessary will be omitted from the blueprint. 
Radiohead would call it In Rainbows, and it 
would be their starchild, their Hegelian end 
of sorts, in naked clarity. 

It began as a blog called Dead Air Space, 
where Thom Yorke & Co. regularly posted 
updates of their new project, including a 
cryptic blackboard covered in poten-
tial song titles and lyrical snippets. In 
2006, they embarked on a short world 
tour for the purpose of road-testing 
said songs. Later that year, they returned 
to the studio, keeping mum about their 
progress aside from a few online posts. On 
Oct. 1, 2007, the band announced that its 
new work would be released in 10 days as an 
mp3 download, and consumers could pay 
whatever they wanted, even $0. The world 
watched as another pillar holding up the 
antiquated whales of the music industry 
collapsed. 

The music itself, however, may fall 
short of impossible expectations on 
first listen for its unassuming texture. 
Only “Bodysnatchers” allows Jonny 
Greenwood to shred, and for the rest 
of the album he relegates his guitar 
to arpeggios and pointed-but-sparse 
chords. All instruments register clear-
ly and organically into the mix, with 
only the occasional lyric buried for 
mystique, further 
emphasizing Yorke’s 
elongated melodies.

L ike its companion exhibit, Out of Time, Out of Mind, the drawn exhibition Out of Line is a statement in absence, and 
how absence can shape certain presences. The 
exhibition’s main genre, drawing, reveals itself 
as an absent creation — it is sculpture absent of 
form, or painting absent of layers.

“To Lupita Low Life; Happiness is Eating 
Eggs; Love You; Edie Massey” explores the 
shared symbolism of the drawn form and writ-
ten word, where images and characters become 
interchangeable. The mixed-media works of 
Jorge Tellaeche’s untitled piece makes com-
mentary on vintage portraits and the underly-
ing neurosis just waiting to be psychoanalyzed, 
while Masami Teraoka’s study for “LA Sushi 
Series,” a 1981 pen-and-ink rendering, refer-
ences an atlas of Japanese cultural iconography 
— woodblock prints, sushi menus, cartoons and 
calligraphy — through shared negative space.

The exhibition is a broad, sometimes off-topic 
investigation into drawing methods, and the con-
cept of rendering absence to elicit presence.

Y ou’ve surely heard the news: Reigning kings of rock Radiohead have released In Rainbows, their first album in four years. But Animal Collective, an experimental Baltimore four-piece, also released Strawberry Jam earlier this 
year. It’s a psych-folk, ambient-rock manifesto to challenge the throne.

In Rainbows, a romantic and expertly thorough study of 
Radiohead’s musical capacity, finds the band at the peak of its 

user-friendly pop tenure with nowhere else to go. Strawberry 
Jam rises up against In Rainbows’ status quo with compelling 

and accessible fringe-pop, shaped by echoing psychedelic 
percussion, heart-stopping melody, earthy textures and 
resonant dissonance; Animal Collective topple the anti-
quated ’90s-rock hegemony, reclaiming popular music 
with innovative composition and sonic experimentation 
that hasn’t been felt since Radiohead did the same.

As Strawberry Jam unfolds on opener “Peacebone,” 
Geologist (Brian Weitz) massages a formless wall of elec-
tric static into a steady 3/4, to which Panda Bear (Noah 

Lennox) adds a shifting, tribal drumbeat and Deakin (Josh 
Dibb) contributes a fuzzy throb of bass. Over all of this, 

Avey Tare (Dave Portner) lends vocals that slip octaves in a 
heartbeat, then explode into screaming fervor while the entire 

weight of the song rests on its soft melody.  Floating past 
“Chores,” an expansive tribal chant that leaves listen-
ers in a graveyard haze, we arrive at the contemporary 
epic “For Reverend Green,” which slowly builds over a 
shifting, indecipherable time signature, pushed along by 
reverberating guitars, a doo-wop “Woo-oo-oo-oo” and 
throbbing floor toms, only to tear its way roughshod 
through Tare’s chest, his falsetto crescendoing into 
fervorous Black Flag–style yelps that echo the song’s 

title. It is impossible not to be carried away by Tare’s 
tidal wave of enthusiasm, and “Fireworks” rides this 
crest into booming explosions of light, sound and 

hi-hats.
This three-song trifecta at the heart of 

Strawberry Jam is one of the most powerful 
moments in recorded music, ever.

Sure, “15 Step” is the perfect acid-techno-
R&B antidote to Hail to the Thief, Jonny 
Greenwood’s guitar rocks “Bodysnatchers” 
all the way to the bank, and the call-and-
response percussive rhythm/lilting melody 
of “Videotape” gets me weak in the knees, 
but the gold standard isn’t at the end of In 
Rainbows. All of its gimmicks are typical 
— if perfected — Radiohead, whether a 
glitchy electronic homage to Kid A, a gen-

tle melody that’s been bouncing around 
their live sets since Amnesiac, or 

Thom Yorke’s soft hum-over-vio-
lin bit on the orchestral “Faust 

Arp,” straight off Thief.  
Instead, Animal 

Collective interprets 
disparate noise, from 

hazy tape hisses and 
processed echoes 
to Brian Wilson-
esque choruses 
and Henry Rollins’ 

A s an artist (but much like a terrorist), UCSD M.A. candidate Iana Quesnell engages the living environ-ment through drawings that map her surrounding 
ecology.

Regardless of location (in her car, a studio, a hotel or a tent) 
or position (frontal, bird’s eye, street map) Quesnell draws a 
variety of landscapes in charcoal that depict her latest ecology. 
Tight, careful renderings become expansive spaces as her large-
scale images absorb the viewer into all perspectives comprising 
her living environment.

The Cerca Series presents several new drawings and an 
animation that explores the fluid, binational environment that 
Quesnell occupies.

A h, award season: when stu-dio machines, faced with smart filmmakers, pump 
out half-baked character dra-
mas, shooting to wrap their teeth 
around the great, greasy, phallic 
member that is Oscar — praying 
that if they blow hard enough, 
they’ll get a big cash payoff. It’s 
artistic prostitution at its worst, 
made all the more embarrass-
ing when catching legitimate tal-
ent in the crossfire. It happened 
two years ago with white-flight 
blowhard “Crash,” this decade’s 
biggest money-shot filth flick; it 
happened in 2002 with “Chicago,” 
an ego parade as painful as pull-
ing fingernails. “Things We Lost 
in the Fire” ends up as this year’s 
entry, with potentially successful 
amounts of talent and emotional 
setup, but ultimately whittled 
down to a skeletal melodrama 
by studio executives in the race 
to add an aviary to their Xanadu 
summer yacht.

UCSD alum Benicio Del Toro 
plays Jerry, a heroin junkie living 
in a blighted Seattle neighbor-
hood.  He quits and relapses like 
a revolving door, opting to spend 
his free time lying on a flophouse 
mattress, stoned or drunk, with 

the Velvet Underground on full 
blast. When he gets the sudden 
news from Audrey (Halle Berry) 
that Brian — his best friend and 
her husband   — has been mur-
dered, he hits a new low. We see 
Brian only in flashbacks, played 
with quick wit and humanity by 
David Duchovny, as he stands by 
Jerry when there’s no other friend 
in the world.

For the two-hour duration, we 
want to follow their camaraderie; 
instead, we get a photocopy of the 
Hollywood moving-on-with-
your-life rulebook. Audrey 
offers Jerry a room at her 
house (and subsequent 
sexual tension), where 
everyone sees him as the 
surrogate daddy-hus-
band-friend. If Audrey 
needs to fix some-
thing, Jerry’s got it. If 
the neighbor needs a 
new running partner, 
out-of-shape Jerry 
fits the bill.  And 
while Papa Mulder 
couldn’t even get 
his 5-year-old son 
to dunk his head 
underwater, Unkie 
Benicio will get 
the job done.

CHE CAFE / OCT. 23 / 7 P.M. / FREE

Bitch all you want about Michael Moore 
being a propagandist, but if you disregard 
his worth as a filmmaker, please check your 
artistic coat at the Dick Cheney booth for 
the sterile and emotionless. Moore’s done 
his share of muckraking (notably an unwise 
interview with Charlton Heston), but if that’s 
all you know of him, you apparently haven’t 

seen “Sicko,” Moore’s 2007 survey of the 
American Health Care system. Funny, moving, 
and surprisingly uplifting despite minor factual 
flaws, his treatise on the health care failure in 
the U.S. works its way into more of a study on 
what democracy entails for it’s people.  Che

$4 dinner starting at 5 p.m. (CM)

The Black Lips
THE CASBAH / OCT. 18 / 8:30 P.M. / $10

The four greasy, sloppy boys of the Black 
Lips — grunged-up as their cheap crop of 
teenage punk may be — wear a Southern 
folk sensibility far beyond their years. For 
every fuzzy, lo-fi guitar screech and muddled 
wisecrack there is an earth-etched melody and 
a buried tale of working-man strife. After three 
furious studio albums and two balls-out live 

discs, new flower-punk full-length Good Bad 
Not Evil seems a little less embarrassed about 
its roots, clearing the brambles of distortion 
for a (still stubbornly youthful) take on country-
western blues. But come this evening, spilling 
over the creaky Casbah stage, fuck that — you 
can shove your damned croak-folk right up 
your music-snob asshole. (SW)

emotive growl, crafting cohesive pop 
songs with an astonishing novelty 
and compelling immediacy.

Speaking of terrific albums, and to 
further draw parallel the old and new 
rulers of outsider rock, 2007 also saw 
the release of the electro-looping, lo-
fi Beach-Boys amalgam Person Pitch, 
Panda Bear’s third solo album (From 
which “Derek,” Strawberry Jam’s clos-
ing tune, appropriates). The Eraser, 
Thom Yorke’s recent solo album, is 
essentially a repetitive exercise in self-
indulgence — it’s got a few decent 
moments but nothing in the way of 

innovation. Person Pitch, however, is 
a serious contender for best release of 
the year (keeping in mind, of course, 
that Strawberry Jam is competing in 
the “of forever” bracket). 

So, Strawberry Jam is to In Rainbows 
as Person Pitch is to The Eraser, 
— or really, as HOLY SHIT, WHAT 
IS THIS, I HAVE NEVER HEARD 
SOMETHING SO COMPELLING IN 
MY LIFE is to pretty damn good, but in 
the end, just more Radiohead.

I mean come on, guys, do we real-
ly need another Radiohead album? 
Did The Bends not come out when we 
were in second grade? Seriously.

So that the sunny disposition 
doesn’t escape stormy melodrama; 
Audrey constantly chastizes Jerry 
for “stealing” Brian’s moments, Jerry 
relapses and of course there’s that 
dinner moment in which every-
one ponders their own selfish grief.  
(Cue the epiphany montage set to 
“Solsbury Hill.”) It’s not unreal, it’s 
Hollywood real!

Which is a shame, since Del Toro 
finds the perfect pitch for rattled 
addict Jerry, his glazed eyes still reel-
ing from constant drug abuse. And 
despite some ludicrous dialogue, 
Duchovny transforms a potential-
ly smug, rich asshole into a man 
of genuine virtue.  Berry similarly 
does what she can with a woman 
whose short, neurotic temper leaps 
logic even for a wailing widow (of 
ever-varying decibels). Each scene 
leapfrogs from well-crafted drama to 
ham-and-cheese ensemble, as direc-
tor Susanne Bier employs every visual 

metaphor under the sun for maxi-
mum audience impact. When are we 
going to stop being marauded with 
the shaky, handheld camera indicat-
ing fragility, which Bier milks to the 
last frame? Obviously, this is deep 
stuff.

There are currently two films in 
theaters about posthumous grief — 
this little romp and “The Darjeeling 
Limited.” Though they belong to dif-
ferent genres, “Darjeeling”’s explora-
tion of coping with death is far supe-
rior; there’s real connection between 
people, rather than each character 
acting on personal volition. The nar-
cissistic latter is the brainchild of 
Hollywood madmen who allow for 
mediocrity like “Things We Lost in 
the Fire” to pass initial lines of artistic 
defense, such as script-readers. Their 
trick: craft a well-tested plot around 
Oscar’s venerable checklist of stylistic 
requirements, make you think you 
love it and pickpocket your $10 in the 
meantime.

film review
rendition

By Willy Staley
Contributing Writer

I t’s a confusing time in a man’s life when he begins to admire other dudes much younger than he. The 
problem is this: As I get older, my 
favorite new rappers seem to get 
younger and younger.

The Pack are prime examples of 
this fresh wave of Young, Fly and 
Flashy rap from the Bay Area (and 

all of California, for that matter). 
Not only are they a few years behind 
most of us here at UCSD, they’re also 
significantly fly-er and flashier.

If you’re aware of the Pack’s exis-
tence at all, you probably know them 
for their first single, “Vans,” a musi-
cal tribute to the popular shoe brand. 
With Young L’s minimal beat and an 
impossibly catchy hook (“Got my 
Vans on but they look like sneak-
ers”), the Pack convinced a large 
segment of Bay Area hip-hoppers to 
dress like skaters — a movement of 
sorts that has strangely been dubbed 
“punk rock.” But along with the fans, 
they also drew a whole lot of haters, 
including a group that goes by the 
name Nascar, because they “go.” No 
joke.

Nascar released a song called 
“Punk Rock Don’t Go,” in which they 
pan rappers like those in the Pack 
for wearing “medium shirts and girl 
shoes” — and many Bay Area fans 
seem to agree. Pack-haters often feel 

that the foursome (Young L, Stunna, 
Lil B, and Uno) is nothing more than 
what it looks like: a bunch of foolish 
high schoolers.

What many of these haters might 
not realize is that to ridicule the Pack 
is to disagree with the one and only 
Todd “Too $hort” Shaw, the man 
who discovered them and practi-
cally created the Bay Area’s rap scene 
(along with the word “bitch”) — so 
it would be safe to assume he knows 
his way around the genre. What Too 
$hort liked about the Pack is that 
they still know how to have fun 
— something many of their peers 
seem to have forgotten. They’re not 
going to dazzle (read: bore) us with 
fancy wordplay or social commen-
tary, but I guarantee they’ll show up 
to the House of Blues late, drunk and 
fresh-to-death, and you should try 
your best to do the same.

The Pack perform live Oct. 24 at 
the House of Blues in the Gaslamp 
District.

Falling Into Place” build to an orchestral climax, 
as Yorke ruminates on surreal locales like the 
bottom of the sea where carnivorous worms 
feed. Five to 10 years from now, common folk 
will listen to a contemporary pop recording 
and not even flinch when historically offputting 
electronics are incorporated.

This marks the first occasion where a 
Radiohead album could be enjoyed in both 

Starbucks and on college radio, proof that they 
already changed the climate of music, and are 
now cementing it as common vernacular. For 
once in their career, Radiohead succeed at 
being ladies’ men, trying on a genuine romantic 
persona in forlorn ballads “House of Cards” 
and “All I Need.” And as the grimly bittersweet 
“Videotape” rolls the end credits, we come back 
down to Earth and see where the future will 
take us.

Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings
■ 100 Days, 100 Nights
DAPTONE RECORDS

N ever underestimate the power of a good icebreaker. As the tiny, black and impos-sibly big-voiced Sharon Jones struts down 
her R&B-legend staircase, neon-lit from below, 
to the descending trumpet call of a standby 
Dap-King player, she grabs us by the gut and 
makes her anguished introduction: “100 days, 
100 nights/ To know a man’s heart,” it goes, 
joined by varying horned loop-curls and the 
band’s signature jump-clip. “And a little more/ 
Before he knows his own.”

The set-starter for Sharon Jones and the Dap-
Kings’ latest — conjuring both 2002’s exhilarat-
ingly tense Dap-Dippin’ and 2006’s highly praised 
Naturally, an explosive resurrection of the kind of 
full-bodied funk that died with the ’70s — knows 
just how to melt our hearts. It inflates a cushioned 
bookend for the rest of the album, wiggling its 
way through our sympathetic ears until we can’t 
help but remember everything we’ve ever loved 
about that burly, almost maternal heart-song and 
its toe-tappin’ Georgia backup (the eight-strong 
Dap-Kings, who spent the last year as the house 

band for Winehouse-mania).
So when second track “Nobody’s Baby” begins 

to sink into an elementary-bassline James Brown 
imitation, and third and fourth tracks “Tell Me” 
and “Be Easy” fall further into buttery jukebox 
background, all that registers are the pleasures 
of a familiar funk-settled valley — and for now, 
we’re perfectly happy here. Mid-record beacons 
“When the Other Foot Drops, Uncle” (what’s that, 
Sharon? Where’s the yellow-food popsicle?) and 
the low-rumbling “Let Them Knock” — which 
sees our good-gal shaking her conscience for 
some of Marvin Gaye’s serene sexuality — do 
momentarily wake our enthusiasm from this 
contented slumber, but we’re quickly lulled back 
into the overwhisked froth of new sorrows like 
“Something’s Changed” and “Answer Me.” Don’t 
worry, honey — you had us at hello.

Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings perform live 
Dec. 1 at the Belly Up in Solana Beach.

Peanut Butter Wolf Presents 2K8
■ B-Ball Zombie War
STONES THROW RECORDS

T he crate diggers and hip-hop obscurists at Los Angeles-based Stones Throw Records could very possibly be running underground’s best 
label right now — though maybe not in terms of 
sales or exposure. But pioneering excellence of 
this caliber can’t go unnoticed for long, and the 
newest compilation from DJ extraordinaire and 
label founder Peanut Butter Wolf is certainly a 
case for our attention.

Beat trailblazer J Dilla — the most promi-
nent artist from Stones Throw, even if his recent 
acclaim is posthumous — plays a key role as 
usual, providing a fifth of the beats from his 
seemingly bottomless vault. One of his espe-
cially dope contributions, “His Mash’s Revenge,” 
featuring an awkwardly chopped-up piano loop, 
is tacked down by Guilty Simpson’s arrogant 
growl and MF Doom’s nonsensical weird-raps.

For those that prefer a more traditional hip-
hop standard, Percee P’s “Legendary Lyricist” 
and MED’s “Break It Down” master the basics, 
with drums that hit hard and flows that hit 

harder. Still, most tracks stray pretty far from 
the basic loop-and-drum-break formula, 
exploring off-road trails like the ’70s synths of 
“Funk Sidewayz” or the deep low end of “Bass 
Creator’s Groove.” But spotlighting individual 
tracks disservices the nature of this expert com-
pilation: It’s best as a whole, a labored mixtape 
whose playlist is more important than its parts. 
PB Wolf paces the album with a veteran’s dexter-
ity, so conflicting samples and beat-genres are 
never at odds.

B-Ball Zombie War begins with just the right 
MCs and knock to get our heads nodding, then 
dares to wander through a range of tempos, 
dark tunnels and tangents that — though they 
might throw traditionalists for a loop — should 
at least earn Stones Throw a best-in-scene nom-
ination, each track a worthy piece of woofer-rat-
tling proof.

ever-evolving entity and if these 
changes had not occurred, raggedy 
relief pitchers like Mike Myers and 
Steve Kline would have been unem-
ployed years ago. But is it too late to 
return to pitching’s glory days? I say we 
do away with pitch counts all together, 
cut down on visits to the bullpen. And 
if you’re really bent on keeping arms 
from getting hurt, we can just outlaw 
the slider. 

It’s not too late to train kids to know 
it’s OK to pitch deep into games and 
that the human arm definitely has the 
potential to pitch back-to-back games. 
Imagine how much more confidence 
young pitchers would have if instead 
of being removed from the game at the 
first sign of trouble, they were left in to 
learn how to get out of jams. Kids are 
now developing nasty curveballs at the 
tender age of seven, and people won-
der why arms are so injury prone. 

We must spread the gospel of the 
pitching days of old. We must preach 
the word of Koufax and Drysdale. The 
pitching revival depends on us. 

Here’s a nice thought: the seventh 
game of the World Series sees Jeff 
Francis and Fausto Carmona matching 
scoreless innings for a full 15 innings 
before Matt Holiday wins it with a 
walk-off. 

Impossible? It wouldn’t have been 
50 years ago.

State San Marcos on Oct. 12 by a 
2-0 margin. Junior forward Patrick 
Salazar netted the first goal from 
an assist from senior midfielder 
Thomas Pham. Pham scored a goal 
of his own to distance his team from 
the visiting Cougars.

Fresh off their promising Cal 
State San Marcos victory, the Tritons 
faced UC Riverside on Oct. 14 in a 
game that at times resembled an 
Ultimate Fighting Championship 
match. The Highlanders started the 
carnage by earning the first red 
card of the match when a player 
lashed out at sophomore forward 
Evan Cook after play was over. 
UC Riverside drew its second red 
card when the referee caught a 
Highlander giving senior midfield-
er Julio Palacios a high elbow.

The Tritons, not to be outdone 
in the card game, received a red 
of their own late into the match. 
Junior stopper Carlos Ordaz, who 
had found himself on the ground, 
kicked one of the UC Riverside 
players and was ultimately sent off 
the pitch.

Finally, after the fights had been 
quelled and the dust had settled, 
UCSD emerged with a quality 5-0 
win.

According to junior forward 
Norman Pitt, playing against a fel-
low UC team added an extra ele-
ment of competition to the match, 
but he admitted that drawing three 
red cards was not ideal.

“The game got a little out of con-
trol,” Pitt said.

The early season physical play 
and determination is a good sign 
for the young team. According 
to Pham, the final score, not the 
amount of penalties, is what should 
be the main focus.

“We scored two goals in the 
first half and another three in the 
second,” Pham said. “We destroyed 
them in the second half when they 
were down and devastated. And 
about the penalties, I think that the 
ref was a little red-card happy.”

Penalties aside, the Tritons com-
piled an impressive 2-1 record to 
start the season. For a team with 
lots of fresh-faced players, the lead-

ership of senior veterans like Pham 
and senior midfielder Jesse Lyon 
directs the squad.

“The most vital element to our 
success this season will be playing 
as a team,” Pitt said. “We have been 
together as a team for about two 
weeks, yet we’ve already played three

we have done very well. That said, all

HOT CORNER

This summer, a milestone was reached that may never be accomplished again. To base-
ball purists, it was a record that embod-
ies the true soul of the sport. It was a 
moment to cherish above all others. 

And no, Barry Bonds had nothing 
to do with it. 

On Aug. 5, Tom Glavine of the 
Atlanta Braves guided his team to an 8-
3 win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley 
Field. The six one-third innings turned 
in by the veteran 
lefty gave him his 
300th career vic-
tory, making him 
the 23rd, and pos-
sibly last pitcher, to 
achieve the feat in 
major league his-
tory. The win pro-
pelled Glavine into 
an illustrious club, joining the likes of 
legends Cy Young and Nolan Ryan. 

The 300-win club is not exactly 
exclusive at 23 members, but what 
makes Glavine’s achievement so 
remarkable is that it might be the last 
time a sports fan can open the paper 
and see a headline about the newest 
pitcher to reach 300 wins. 

The evolving nature of baseball has 
completely changed the role of a start-
ing pitcher. In the good old days, pitch-
ers would start a game and, barring a 
complete meltdown or freak tsunami 
rolling through the stadium, that same 
pitcher would go the distance for a 
complete game. Pitch counts were as 
unheard of as the Bay Area Laboratory 
Co-operative. And the only remedy for 
a sore arm was more throwing. 

In today’s game, nobody is “just 
a pitcher.” A starting pitcher will get 

the game going, but is by no means 
expected to finish it. The development 
of bullpens has led to the creation 
of middle relievers, long reliever, left-
handed specialists, right-handed spe-
cialists, set-up men and closers. With 
so many players charged with such a 
specific task, the guarantee of the start-
ing pitcher collecting his team’s win 
has gone the way of wool uniforms and 
the spitball. 

The bar has been lowered so much 
for starting pitch-
ers that major 
league baseball 
now defines a 
quality start as 
lasting at least six 
innings and giving 
up at most three 
earned runs. This 
means that pitch-

ers are being praised for their ability 
to labor through two-thirds of a game 
while surrendering a run every other 
inning. As a former pitcher myself, I 
fully understand the difficulty in that 
seemingly simple job, and can remem-
ber far too many times when I would 
have given my nonpitching arm to get 
through six innings. But I am sad to 
see how the once-glorious position has 
been diminished. 

Gone are the days when pitchers 
would throw complete games in both 
legs of a doubleheader. Gone are the 
days of the three-man rotation. Gone 
are the days when a pitcher’s career 
ended solely because he could no lon-
ger pitch through the arthritis and had 
to babysit his grandchildren. 

To illustrate my point about how 
much pitching has changed, I’d like to 
tell you a brief story about the greatest 

game ever played:
July 2, 1963. The freezing con-

fines of Candlestick Park played host 
to the San Francisco Giants and the 
Milwaukee Braves. Both teams sent 
their ace to the mound to face the 
shuddering fog that rolled in off San 
Francisco Bay. For the Giants, the 
young 26-year-old Juan Marichal took 
the hill for the home team. The Braves 
sent out legendary Warren Spahn — at 
this point 42 years old but still domi-
nant, as he would go on to win 23 
games that season. 

Marichal, better known as the 
“Dominican Dandy,” compiled 243 vic-
tories in his career and, more remark-
ably, 244 complete games. Spahn is 
now regarded as the best left-handed 
pitcher in baseball history. Both pitch-
ers were first-ballot inductees into the 
Hall of Fame.

On that epic evening, the two aces 
embodied pitching’s true essence.
After nine innings, the score remained 
tied 0-0. Before the start of the 10th 
inning, then-Giants’ manager Roger 
Craig approached Marichal, asking 
him whether he had enough left in 
him to keep pitching. Marichal quickly 
pointed to the mound where the aged 
Spahn was warming up to throw the 
10th and said, “If that old man can still 
pitch, then so can I.”

 Fast forward to the bottom of 
the 16th inning. That’s right, the 16th 
inning. At that point, the game had 
almost equaled the length of two regu-
lar contests and, unbelievably, neither 
pitcher had left. Marichal finished with 
well over 200 pitches thrown, having 
handcuffed the future home run king 
Hank Aaron in the process. Spahn 
was not lucky enough to escape the 

16th inning, surrendering a walk-off 
homerun to Willie Mays to end the 
marathon that sent both pitchers into 
the pages of baseball lore. 

The thought of a similar game 
in today’s era is beyond absurd. In 
2006, Aaron Harang of the Cincinnati 
Reds led the majors with six complete 
games. That same year, Harang’s team-
mate Bronson Arroyo led the league in 
innings pitched with 240. Fifty years 
ago a pitcher would be considered a 
failure with those stats.

The closest active pitcher is Randy 
Johnson, who has 284 career wins. 
Injuries have sidelined the six-foot-
ten-inch lefty, and 300 wins now 
appear to be out of reach for him. Next 
in line is Mike Mussina with 250 but, 
again, his age makes him an extreme 
underdog. Granted, there are a 
few young pitchers like 
C.C. Sabathia, 
Johan Santana 
and Justin 
Verlander who 
have showed potential 
but it is far too early 
in their careers to start 
hypothesizing about 
300. 

Young pitchers 
are now coddled and 
pampered to the point 
where getting to the 
big leagues in 
three sea-

sons is considered magnificent. 
Joba Chamberlain, a prospect for 

the New York Yankees was babied so 
much that he was banned from pitch-
ing in back-to-back games as a reliever 
— giving birth to the phrase, the “Joba 
Rule.” 

We also see the harmful impacts of 
modern-pitcher developments when 
a young pitcher is brought up to the 
majors and must pitch throughout the 
elongated season for the first time. 
These young studs often over-pitch 
in order to thrive, and their infantile 
arms cannot handle the pressure, lead-
ing to serious injuries that can derail 
their once-promising careers. Where 
are you now, Francisco Liriano? 

I understand that baseball is an

The final day of tryouts for this 
year’s men’s club soccer team was 
on Oct. 7, and the newly formed 
squad had only two days a a team 
before its season opener against UC 
Santa Barbara. The Tritons showed 
an unusual amount of cohesion for 
a team new to playing with each 
other, but despite some early attacks 
they fell 2-1. 

As if the challenge of playing as 
a three-day-old team wasn’t enough, 
UCSD faced its hardest opponent of 
the year in the Gauchos, a team that 
prides itself on reflecting the skill 
level of their varsity brethren, who 
are Division I national champions. 

The Tritons had some scoring 
chances in the first half, but after the 
opening period the score remained 
tied at zero. In the second half, the 
Gauchos earned a corner kick after 
increasing their offensive pressure 
and attacking the goal more fre-
quently. UCSB played the corner 
short to a trailing midfielder, whose 
ensuing cross met the foot of a 
crashing defensive back. The back 
needed no extra touches and put 
the one-timer away, breaking the 
scoreless tie.

Later in the half, the well-con-
ditioned UCSB squad exploited 
the Tritons’ mounting fatigue and 
notched its second goal of the match 
when one of its talented midfielders 
created enough space between him 

and a tired Triton defender.
Once the Gaucho midfielder had 

enough space, he pushed the ball to 
his left and ripped a shot from 18 
yards out. The kick was not unstop-
pable, but strong enough to find its 
way to the back of the net, giving 
UCSB a two-goal cushion.

Despite the deficit, the Tritons 
continued to fight, sending balls 

into the Gaucho’s half of the field 
but falling short of goal repeatedly. 
The lack of scoring was not a result 
of poor offense; the Tritons had 
many open opportunities at goals, 
but twice hit the crossbar and at 
least once shot the ball wide with 
only the keeper to beat.

Finally, with less than five min-
utes left, freshman forward Brian 

Labadie notched his first career goal 
when he stayed onside and received 
a ball from behind the Gauchos’ 
back line. Labadie controlled the 
pass and flicked it past the goal-
keeper to bring UCSD within one 
goal.

An energized Triton squad made 
several more runs at the goal before 
simply running out of time. Despite 

losing the match, the Tritons were 
optimistic. During the team’s post-
game huddle, head coach Kaveh 
Pajouhan said he was very impressed 
by the team’s early cohesion and was 
looking forward to its next match.

their opening loss by beating Cal
