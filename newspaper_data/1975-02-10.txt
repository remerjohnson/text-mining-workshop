Gne Up M~i l 
Ashford told of giving up 15 

years seniority in the postal 
service to become a 
professional umpire in 1956. 
Ashford began in the Mexican 

. League, moved to the Pacific 
Coast League, then umpired five 
years in the American League 
before retiring in 1971. 

A pioneer in creative ex-
pression in umpiring, one of 
Ashford's greatest thrills was 
umpiri ng the 1970 World Series. 

Umpiring now is in marked 
ontrast to when he began , Ash-

ford said "When I started in '56 
major league umps got $9,000 a 
year -- now they get $14,500 and 
$50 a day expense money and a 
pen ion just l ike the 
bal lplayers " 

A hford jokingly remember d 
ome of th bench Jockeys he 

encountered during hi areer. 
One, he aid, said someth ing 

111 the dugout like "Umpire my 
foot . I could scratch my 
po trior and come with a better 
umpire under my fll1ger nails 
You know I had to go fi nd him !"

Councillnan Haro Discusses F irst Days • In Office 
by James G. Solo 

ThE' election of J 1m Bates to the 
County Board of Supervi ors in 

ovemb r left a vacancy on the 
an Diego Ci ty Counci l that was 

fill d r c ntly by the int rim 
appointment of Jeff Haro until 
th November municipal ele -
tlon . Th new coun ilman spoke 
Wi th the Triton Times last week . 

The appointm nt of Haro is 
noteworthy in at I~ast one 
respect he I the fir t citiz n of 
MeXican de cent to serve on th 
( Ity ouncil In mod rn time . 
I laro, owner of a lumber bu iness 
Wi th extensive . dealing in 
Mexi 0 , said, "My appointm ent 
may have an hi tori ignifican e, 
bu t as to how It may affect my 

~entiments , I believe I have the 
\ame con erns a anyone else." 

Though Haro i the son of an 
Immigrant working lass family 
from M xico, he de cribe his 
background as " unusual" because 
he is co li ge edu ated and was a 
commis ioned officer in the 
military . 

Unusua l Dist rict 
Haro live in th comfortable 

Mis ion Hill area of his District 
Figh t , a distri ct one might 
d nibe as being a unusual as its 
councilman. Haro call it a 
diver e district- it contains th 
l nter of city government and 
C.ommer e, large concentrations 
of th elderly, and many people

ec.onoml ladder Th di tri t i

Har \ cil trict II1dude the part 

of th e Ity that is adjac nt to the 
Mexican border and separated by 
the South Bay communitie from 
th ity proper. San Y idro and 
Palm City give Haro's district a 
decidedly ethnic flavor because 
of the high numbers of Chicanos 

di trict, and it I here that much 
opposition to Lindburgh Fie ld, 

an Diego' airport, has been 
brewin g.

Haro ays that there was more

city government and commerce, large 
concentrations of the elderly, and many at

t)~IIIIt:, Letters 
Will A New UC President N1ake A Difference? Side Door Noise Uncool 

BY PAUL GOODMAN 
i Northern Vice President, UC-AFT 
, Professor of History, UC D~vis 

Will a ne~ university p'.:sident bring new 
vitality to the University of California, a vitality 
that will fundilmentaliy improve the university's 
ability to deal with its problems? 

The prospect of a new president, to be chosen 
within the next few months, has not generated 
high hopes for such improvement. No change of 
personality at the top is I ikely to do that for 
several reasons. 

The commanding heights of management in the 
large universities tend to be presided over by 
colorless, bureaucratic personalities notably 
lacking in any educational vision about which 
they feel deeply and will fight for vigorously . 

How many academics can name the presidents 
of such institutions as Harvard, Princeton, the 
University of Michigan and the University of 
Chicago? There is no reason why these presidents 
hould be academic household names outside of 

their own bailiwicks. 
For the most part, university leaders today, 

especially at the major public institutions, have 
become preservers of the system as it now func-
tions, for good or for ill. They are survival 
managers who have no time to grapple in realistic 
and creative ways with the fundamental problems 
we face. They appear preoccupied with preserving 
the near-monopoly oj power they and the 
governing boards who have chosen them have 
enjoyed for generations; they are suspicious, if 
not hostile, to those who ask them to deal with the 
real problems. 

The chances that the University of California 
Regents, split between liberal and Reagan fac-
tions, will choose a dynamic personality, an 
aggressive educator, a person with ideas that 
might rock the boat, are slim indeed. Equally slim 
is the chance that a new president would be 
successful in revitalizing the University without 
shaking up the top-heavy, unimaginative 

b~reaucracy he (or she?) will inherit . 
The revitalization of undergraduate studies 

surely must stand at the top of anybody's list of 
problems. The 1970's have brought vocationalism 
back with a vengeance to the campuses, and with 
it endemic cheating, grade competition, anti-
intellectualism and un interest in learning. Is it too 
much to expect that the next president of the 
University of California will attempt to establish 
an atmosphere that can lead to a restoration of 
general education at the undergraduate levell 

It would be helpful, for a start, if a new 

president at least admitted that we have a 
problem : students cannot read and write ef-
fectively and efficiently; the cultural level has 
deteriorated; and, above all, the university has not 
created undergraduate programs which encourage 
most students to develop their minds in and 
sensibi l ities in ways that will prepare them for 
lifelong learning and encourage their personal 
growth . 

The problems of undergraduate instruction, 
identified in the 1960's, still exist. Nothing basic 
has been done to solve them as a recent report, 
commissioned by the University, points out. The 
various Regental plans and state-supported 
programs for educational " innovation" are 
pathetically inadequate because there has never 
been any clear understanding of what the 
problems are. Unless a new president addresses 
himself to these issues, responsible critical 
legislators and concerned student leaders will 
remain a thorn in the side of the university. 

A second major problem the new president will 
face is the university'S reputation as an elitist 
institution, ever ready to offer degrees to the 
upper-middle income student and to serve the 
needs of the Defense Department, the Atomic 
Energy Commission and agribUSiness . Yet, in fact 
and by reputation, the university (ails to serve 
qualified students who come, without funds, from 
the working class and minority communities. It 
refuses to redirect a major portion of applied 
research to advance the well being of farm 
workers and the poor. It fails to focus on the 
problem s of industrial safety, consumer 
protection and environmentalism. 

Finally, the next president will have little 
chance of solving any of UC's problems if the 
administration continues to operate in secretive, 
authoritarian and manipulative ways. The new 
president should welcome collective bargaining, 
not fight it as the present administration has done. 

Indeed, if there is any realistic chance of 
revital izing undergraduate studies, establishing 
democratic access and assuring financial support 
to maintain the quality of the nation's leading 
public institution , it will have to come not from 
the new president, whoever that may be, but from 
the centers of power and influence developed by 
those who work at the University of California .

To quote a friend, " If people could hear; I wonder if they'd listen." I 
• just got back from the Side Door where a friend of mine was a-playin' 
and a-singin' and I'm a little bit frustrated. 

At the outset of the evening, it looked like it was shaping up to be a 
nice relaxing time, with my biggest mid-term out of the way, a bottle or 
two of wine, some people I like, and music, good music . I felt like I was 
going to one of the coffee shops of the "beat generation." 

Well, it's a good thing I wasn't going to let anyone sp?il my pl~ns . 
You see, it seemed as though a couple of people were trYing to do lust 
that . I had stereo sound, music from the stage and talk from those too 
inconsiderate to look around . I don't mean a little conversational 
chatter, but full on gab, no whispering, no vision . Isolated in their 
sterile cubicle , quasi-perceptive existences, these high and mighty 
modern intellectuals couldn 't stop making points with tneir peers to 
l isten . 

Any artist has something worthwhile to express, and when given the 
platform on which to speak, to be talked down is a double kick in th 
ass. I wouldn't have been surprised if the singer just walked off the 
stage . I guess he went with the old adage that "The show must go on," 
but I think that more than anything, he wasn 't going to let anyone spoil 
his evening either . 

Now I'm not saying that the Side Door should be as quiet as a library, 
but I do think that anyone who plays there should be giv n the r~spect 
they deserve for taking their time to play for us . It would be nice if the 
people who play there will want to return . All I'm really asking is that 
during the songs, please have the cou'rtesy to whisper .

At Scripps' IGPP 

Seismic Capsule Measures Quakes on Sea Floor 
Even mini~arthquakes in the 

sea can now be pinpointed for the 
first· time with new seismic 
monitoring capsules that have 
been develop'!d and successfully 
tested in an area of high 
seismicity. 

Scientists and engineers at UC 
San Diego's Institute for 
Geophysics and Planetary Physics 
conducted major capsule ex-
periments off the tip of Baja 
California last spring, using 
Scripps I nstitution of 
Oceanography's Research Vessel 
Ellen B. Scripps. 

The new ocean-bottom 
se ismometer "pop-up" capsule 
was the creation of Dr. William A. 
Prothero Jr ., assistant research 
physicist at the La Jolla 
laboratories and Scripps graduate 
student Ian Reid. 

Under a grant from the 
National Science Foundation, 
Prothero and Reid conceived and 
designed the capsule, did most of 
its assembly and executed field 
tests. Estimated cost for a single 
capsule is $15,000. 

Protherto discussed results of 
these tests during the fall meeting 
of the American Ceo physical 
Union held in San Francisco . 

TT Interview 
, 

Prothero says scientists can use 
earthquake data from capsules to 
define active faults, to determine 
the depth of the earth's brittle 
zone that can produce ear-
thquakes and to study oceanic 
structure . 

"Most ot the major ridge-
transform fault systems occur in 
the sea, and with the advent of 
the plate tectonics theory, 
seismic measurement of these 
areas becomes more important 
and meaningful. "We have now 
devised the first system that is 
able to fine the location and 
depth of earthquakes at sea," 
Prothero reported, adding that in 
the past experimental difficulties 
were 50 great that very I ittle sea-
floor seismic data existed . 

" Through increasing our 
knowledge of earthquakes in the 
ocean. we hope to better un-
derstand the frequency and 
behavior of earthquakes on land. 

" This new techology can also 
be a useful tool for industry in 
making decisions about proposed 
sites for ocean operations. Areas

on Point Lorna and a hazard to 
those I iving in Haro's district in 
the Laural Street area . Haro 
believes the airport will have to 
be moved-"Environmental laws 
requ ire the expenditure of 
millions of dollars to move 
people away from the airport ." 
Haro doesn't know where the 
airport should be. but says there 
should be a careful look at all the 
alternatives. 

Town Center 
In UCSD related matters , Haro 

confessed he didn't know very 
much about the University Towne 
Center . His administrative aide, 
John French , formerly with 
Assemblyman Larry Kapiloff, 
said , however, that Haro would 
be learning about it very shortly, 
as the city council will once again 
take up the question . 

Though Haro wouldn 't say 
specifically whether he would run 
in November, he hinted that he 
would probably do so. 

can now be analyzed for ear-
thquake activity, and the least 
hazardous locations chosen ." 

Prothero 's major field tests off 
Baja were conducted at adepthof 
about 3,65Om (12,000 ft.) on the 
Crest of the East Pacific Rise 
between the Rivera and Tamayo 
Fracture Zones . The Tamayo 
Zone is an extension of the San 
Andreas fault that runs length-
wise through the State of 
California, ending in the Culf of 
Baja California. 

The ocean - bottom 
seismometer system uses three 
capsules placed in a triangular 
array. All three function at the 
same time 50 that earthquake 
locat ions and depths can be 
computed by triangulation . 

The capsule is designed to tall 
freely to the ocean bottom, 
record as many as 1,000 events 
over a period of up to a month, 
and then return to th e surface to 
be recovered at a predetermined 
time, or upon acoustic (sound) 
command from a surface ship 
with the use of a hydrophone. 

The internal electronics in the 
capsule fires one of two elec-
trically controlled explosive bolts,
