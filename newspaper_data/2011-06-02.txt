West Ballroom for a senior show with special guest Buddha’s Playlist.

After launching Spring 
Quarter of this year, the A.S. Store 
plans to continue onto into 2011-
12 by expanding business hours 
and targeting student orgs. 

The idea for an A.S. store 
was first conceived in 2009 as 
former All-Campus Senator 
Tobias Haglund’s senator project. 
The original proposal — which 
passed unanimously at the last 
A.S. meeting of Spring 2010 — 
suggested setting up a brick-and-
mortar store in Price Center. This 
year, Associate Vice President 
of Enterprise Operations Brian 
McEuen decided that the store 
should become a mobile one to 
save $80,000. 

“He proposed an idea to make 
it into a mobile store,” 2010-11 

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang said. 
“This way we could start small, 
try to generate logistics on what 
the market is, what merchandise 
sells, what kind of events we 
should be targeting, who we 
should be targeting, what kind of 
merchandise we should do if it’s 
seasonal or if we should be doing 
other kinds of merchandise for 
outreach.”

A.S. Council allocated 
$204,000 for the store’s start-up 
costs in Spring Quarter 2010, after 
which Ang and McEuen became 
responsible for the enterprise’s 
success. 

“In terms of costs, our budget 
allowed for a $7,000 build out of 
the space, and we did come in 
under budget,” McEuen said in 

Social Sciences Dean Bans Professor’s 
Manuscript, Violates Academic Freedom

Triton Outfitters Mobile Store 
Will Icrease Business On 
Library Walk In 2011-12

By Laira Martin
News Editor

The UCSD Academic Senate has 
deemed that Social Sciences Dean Jeff 
Elman violated academic freedom 
after he attempted to prevent a 
controversial manuscript by sociology 
professor Richard Biernacki from being 
published. 

The Committee on Academic 
Freedom released a report on May 
24, after an Academic Senate meeting 
was held regarding statements made 
by Elman in June 2009 in which he 
ordered Biernacki not to publish his 
book “Inside the Rituals of Social 

Science.”  Biernacki’s book critiques the 
work and data use of other sociologists, 
including that of a colleague within the 
UCSD sociology department. 

“To the best of my knowledge...
the dean never received and therefore 
never read my manuscript before he 
directed me not to publish it upon 
threat of dismissal,” Biernacki said. “His 
preemptive injunction expresses a new 
extreme of administrative paranoia.”

Elman sent a letter to Biernacki 
on June 16, 2009 with claims that 
Biernacki’s critique of the colleague 
— anonymously identified as Professor 
B —  in his manuscript constituted 
harassment.

“You are to stop harassing [Professor 
B],” Elman stated in the letter. “...do not 
publish texts that refer to [Professor 
B].”

The letter also threatens formal 
discipline which includes “written 
censure, reduction in salary, demotion, 
suspension or dismissal.”

“We were flabbergasted and couldn’t 
believe that any dean could have written 
such a thing,” CAF Committee Member 
and associate professor of history Sarah 
Schneewind said.

Biernacki has been a State of 
California Whistleblower since 2007,

Cowboys & Aliens
July 29 — The very title “Cowboys 
& Aliens” is so gleefully ridiculous (a la 
“Snakes On a Plane”), it’s shocking that the 
film’s marketing has such serious action-
flick purpose. And no one — from the 
heavyweight co-stars (Daniel Craig and 
Harrison Ford), to the honorable threesome 
at the helm (Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard 
and Brian Grazer) — seems in on the joke. 
Based on a 2006 graphic novel, “Cowboys & 
Aliens” is just your standard trans-dimen-
sional sci-fi Western battle royale featuring 
a ragtag gang of gritty, poker-faced cowboys 
who must take a stand against their invading 
alien foe. A premise that seems more like a 
parody than the setup for a typical summer 
blockbuster, it leads one to hope that the 
flick takes itself less seriously than the pre-
views so aggressively suggest. 

While the trailers provide a few addition-
al plot points — Craig afflicted with Jason 
Bourne-style amnesia, a magical bracelet 
suspiciously reminiscent of “The Mummy 
Returns” and the sultry Olivia Wilde shed-
ding her clothes — the money-shot clip 
depicting an army of pistol-toting horsemen 
charging a dive-bombing fleet of futuristic 
spacecraft should speak for itself. Regardless, 
whether it’s triumphantly tongue-in-cheek or 
a legendary failure, we’re going to watch out 
for “Cowboys & Aliens.”

NEwS THURSDAY, JUNE 2, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

The last A.S. Council meeting of the year was dry and long-winded, with the meeting 
starting nearly a half hour late. 
       President Alyssa Wing asked 
= to film this 
week’s meeting 
for a council 
advertisement.      
UCSD UC 
Haiti Initiative 
representative 
Brad Segal made 
a plea during 
public forum for council to give his 
organization the $15,000 remainder 
of the Student Initiative Fund. His 
plea failed because he was unable to 
specify where the money would go 
other than for use of discretionary 
projects. Students from the Student 
Sustainability Collective — including 
Public Health Director Annie Le and 
Civil Human Rights Director Victor 
Flores-Osorio — announced that  
Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
passed the bottled water ban last 
Monday, and it will be implemented 
in the fall of 2012. They also said 
Panda Express will stop using 
Styrofoam next year. 

The Campus Affairs Committee 
proposed an amendment to add 
more non-voting members to 
the bylaws. The amendment 
failed because most non-voting 
representatives do not attend council 
meetings.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Brian 
McEuen attempted to enter a 
new enterprise, SwoopThat, into 
New Business and was met with 
objections that continued for at least 
an hour, if not longer. SwoopThat is 
a website that lists price comparisons 
on textbooks. There is no cost to 
join and a small percentage of each 
purchase would go to council.

The very first objection was by 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji, who wanted to know 
whether McEuen and SwoopThat 
founder Jonny Simkin had discussed 

the website with 
the bookstore, 
and whether the 
bookstore would 
instead give 
council a small 
portion of its 
profits. McEuen 
and Simkin 

explained that they had approached 
the bookstore and it rejected 
Simkin’s offer to partner with them. 

Engineering Senator Parminder 
Sandhu later said the multiple 
attempts to bring the bookstore into 
council were misguided and naïve.

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Mac Zilber had 
multiple concerns as well. The first 
was that the issue was not brought to 
council until Tuesday and the second 
was the number of failed business 
decisions council had made in the 
past year. Zilber was strongly against 
student government taking on the 
market and how much money would 
be spent on advertising.

The arguments continued 
and repeated themselves and no 
one could have put it better than 
Associate Vice President of College 
Affairs Leonard Bobbitt.

“There has been an echo in the 
chamber for the last 20 minutes,” 
Bobbitt said.

Though I sometimes find his 
overly optimistic demeanor hard to 
listen to late at night, I walked out 
of the meeting at 10 p.m. thinking 
about how true his statement rang 
through the idiosyncratic nature of 
councilmembers through the years.

Council Fails Amendments, 
Enterprise, at Last Meeting

Academic Senate Resolution Overwhelmingly Passed by 24-4

which means he can disclose 
information to law and government 
agencies about his place of work 
with reasonable cause. 

“The dean’s astonishing attacks 
on me as a State of California 
Whistleblower raise grave legal 
issues,” Biernacki said.

According to Schneewind, Elmer 
wrote the letter with approval from 
faculty and administration above 
him, and with the assistance of 
lawyers that work for UCSD. 

“That all did not bode well for 
the future of academic freedom at 
the university,” Schneewind said.

Academic Senate Chair 
Frank Powell drafted a resolution 
denouncing the dean’s actions, 
which passed 25-4 at the May 24 
meeting, according to the San Diego 
Union Tribune.

Biernacki claims he has not 
spoken to Professor B since 2006 
and has decreased his visibility 
within the department in light of 
this situation to maintain his duties 
as a professor.

“The dean’s so-called harassment 
charge [toward Professor B] centers 
only on a meticulously researched 
publication of mine,” Biernacki said. 
“The dean never cited to me an 
objectionable passage.”

The publication — originally sent 
to Duke University Press in June 2009 
— was also included in Biernacki’s 
request to be considered for a 
promotion which requires publishing 
a second book. Biernacki was forced 
to withdraw his personnel file and 
retract his submission for promotion 
in light of the manuscript.

Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Suresh Subramani 

announced at the May 24 Academic 
Senate meeting that Biernacki is now 
able to publish his manuscript. 

“We deeply regret that statements 
made by [Dean Elman] have led to 
questions about the administration’s 
commitment to academic freedom 
rights,” Subramani and Powell said 
in a statement.

Schneewind has since suggested 
that administrators be required to 
take a seminar on academic freedom 
— similar to the sexual harassment 
seminars that are already required by 
the university. 

Professor B’s identity has not been 
released, therefore he/she could not 
be reached for comment. Elman could 
not be reached for comment. Powell 
refused to comment.

an email. “These items are, of course, 
depreciated over the terms of their 
estimated lives, which for most of our 
hardware is over three years.”

Triton Outfitters opened at the 
first Bear Garden of Spring Quarter 
this year and continued in weeks four 
through seven, during which it sold 
Sun God Festival merchandise. The 
store sold out of its Sun God apparel 
and had to re-order many of its other 
merchandise by the end of the quarter. 

“Since Triton Outfitters became 
the exclusive retailer of Sun God 
Merchandise, we were able to more 
than quadruple the profits from last 
year with lower costs and much higher 
revenue,” McEuen said.

Although the fiscal year is 
not yet over, the store brought in 
approximately over $11,000 in profit 
this quarter. McEuen deemed the store 
a success as it brought profit and was 

popular among students.
“Students seemed to take a great 

liking to the store and brought it 
into their fold of daily campus life 
seemlessly,” McEuen said. 

Partnering with A.S. Graphics 
Studio, which bears no extra costs, 
the A.S. store developed a causes line 
that donates proceeds to non-profit 
organizations. 

“I think for right now, we have 
three shirts that target different non-
profit organizations,” Ang said. “We 
have one for the events in Japan, where 
all the proceeds will go to helping an 
organization for the events in Japan.”

The store will operate for four 
weeks every quarter next year. 
Currently, there are no plans for 
developing Triton Outfitters into a 
permanent space. 

“Triton Outfitters will start to 
become a main fixture of the campus 
next year as we plan to be open for 

business at least four weeks a quarter.”
Ang will not be involved in Triton 

Outfitters next school year, but said 
that this year’s goals of developing 
more merchandise, increasing revenue, 
increasing student organization 
involvement and increasing availability 
will carry on into next year. 

“When I was in office, the focus was 
to really get the student orgs involved 
in this and make this A.S. store really 
be out there for the students,” Ang 
said. “And also to one day maybe 
develop a plan where we can become 
an on-campus store and really develop 
a marketing plan to really outreach to 
the student body.”

The store also launched a website, 
to.ucsd.edu, which is still under 
construction but will allow students to 
shop online.

to be a stutterer — what it actually physically felt 
like, what the muscles felt like. The bones lock up, 
[you get] that sinking feeling in your stomach. He 
really wanted to know viscerally what it was all 
about. And emotionally what it was all about — 
the sense of isolation, the sense of frustration, the 
sense of not being able to have a voice to make 
yourself heard. And he absorbed all of this. After 
days he had that stutter down — it was incredible.

This year, I operated under the idea that every issue had to be as 
good as it could be. Athletics are relatively low-key on campus, and I 
felt any mistake on my part could be detrimental. I wanted Triton ath-
letics to represented in the most professional way possible, in hopes 
that anyone that cared even a little could get an idea of what was going 
on. Simply, I cared a lot about what went to print.

Because of this, I made life difficult at times for quite a few of you, 
especially for Angela, Hayley, Trevor and Regina. I apologize to all of 
you. I stand by the end product, but there were times I felt bad about 
how stubborn I was. Again, I wanted the section to be as good as it 
could be, and I hope you can understand that and it can take a bit of 
the edge off our disagreements.

To the sports writers, I owe much more than a giant thank you. You 
guys cared about what you did, and worked hard to get it right. We 
operated smoothly as a section, and I think you all should be proud of 
your work. 

PK, I really appreciate your enthusiasm. I understand I was pretty 
demanding all year, but you were always willing to work with me and 
learn a bit about what we were working on. You seem to have been born 
without the ability to complain, and I loved working with you.  

Melody, you are driven and so much more talented than you give 
yourself credit for, but mostly you are just a wonderful person.

Laira, I’m glad you came on. The Guardian needs someone normal.
Charlotte, you have so much positivity, and its great to have you 

around. It’s a thing. 
John and Andrew, thanks for bringing fun to the Guardian. You

I ’m 
the girl in the 

back of the classroom 
that rarely talked to anyone. I 

came into college with only one goal: 
Make it out alive (with a degree in hand). I was 

the girl who RateMyProfessored the hell out of everything; 
I asked peers which professors were easy, which classes were easy; I 

emailed my professors before the quarter started, asking them for the syllabus 
(to see if there were any long papers); I dropped MUS4 when I realized the professor 

actually wanted me to learn about music theory. (Who takes lower-div music classes to learn that 
shit?) I’m the easy girl — and I don’t mean that in the promiscuous way, sorry fellas. I wanted to beat the 

system, to stick it to the Man, to get a degree with as little effort as possible. Some of y’all out there know what I 
mean, holla! This may come as a surprise from the self-professed “easy girl,” but yes, I’m graduating in three years. No, 
not three years from now, three years total. I wanted it to be easy, but more so, I wanted to get out. 

Are you guys familiar with the term “suspension of disbelief?” I’d say “Merriam Webster defines it as…” but 
let’s be real here. Wikipedia defines it as when the viewer has to ignore reality to temporarily accept whatever the 
filmmaker, writer, whoever, wants to represent as reality for the sake of being entertained, within the scope of the 
novel/film. Well, that’s what I did when I entered the classroom. I have a firm belief in learning, in making real 
connections with people, in real, life-changing experiences. Yet when I entered the classroom, I suspended my 

F o r 
me, the cure-all for the 

widespread pandemic known as apathy that supposedly 
runs on this campus is being in the Guardian. I’d never thought I’d call a place that faintly 

smells of crap Asian food as home or find a group of weirdos I could call my friends forever, as a 
wise teenybopper might say. In the time I’ve spent here, I’ve learned more about UCSD than any regular 

student really cares for and spoke with so many driven people that keep this campus going.
Despite slaving away in a teeny office at ungodly hours and probably taking off at least 10 years from 

my life span, I have no regrets. This organization has taught me something I will never learn elsewhere — the 
resilience to stay patient and tolerant of others (through breathing techniques and listening to cool jazz, “Little 

Wonders” and “Shanghai Tan”) and the ability to point out the feces of male cattle. 
Before Fall Quarter, I was devastated that the incoming news associate would be leaving for greater things. I swal-

lowed a lump of despair and manned the news ship with 
my hopeful head held high. Soon, Nisha and Laira flew 
in and helped me pulled the reins. It was at that moment 
that I confidently knew the section would be set for a 
lifetime of greatness. 

The last issue I worked on this quarter wasn’t as 
joyous as I thought it’d be. It was confusing for my 
brain to undo the daily routine I had for more than two 
years and embody an uneasy sense of boredom. The 
symptoms were clear — I was going through Guardian 
withdrawal and it was exquisitely bittersweet. And so, 
here are my goodbyes. 

To all the news writers: I’m probably labeled as the 
number one spammer in your inbox. Thank you for 
putting up with all my email pleas. Without you all, I 
wouldn’t have been able to churn through all 60 issues.

Laira: I don’t know how I would’ve survive without 

you. You are composed and that’s all you really need to 
stay strong. Keep the news section foxy. Rebecca and 
Nikki: You gals are both sweethearts and have so much 
ahead of you! Margaret: You’ve got the ambition, now 
keep calm and carry on! Becky: What a fireball — you 
are a magician with any canvas. Andrew and John: You 
guys are a powerhouse, reppin’ the coolest section yet. 
Department of visuals is totes awesome. Melody: You’re 
such a hard-working person. Don’t forget to schedule 
some time for yourself and the Guardian too. PK: You’re 
so nice. Thanks for manning design with Melody!

Liam: You are UCSD Athletic’s biggest cheerleader 
and we need more people like you. Other than that, 
what an egghead. Rachel: Keep the Dougie goin’ in the 
G office. Arielle: You’re the chillest cat I know. Neda: 
You will always be the prom queen in my heart. Ren: 
I believe your loud, crazy side will come out one day. 
Mina: You are the only brown-haired girl that I ever 
liked a little. Naomi: Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

Monica: Keep some ibuprofen handy!  Maddy: I’ve yet 
to see you materialize Taylor Swift. 

Brandon and Annie: You two make up the best 
marketing team this paper has ever had! Emily, you are 
the savior that has risen the Guardian from the depths 
of purgatory. 

Angela: You are a goddess dressed to kill. If the 
Greeks were still into creating deities, you’d be called 
Angela the Masterful. Just because you are an absolute 
beast at leading a herd of earnest student journalists in 
the face of Goliath. One day, you’ll rule the world with 
the clicks of your wisdom tooth. 

Trevor: You are super adorbs. I will miss your 
persnickety remarks. I won’t forget the late-night 
carne asada therapy sessions that we shared as one —
Trangelina forever! 

But I have high hopes for y’all. I’m already proud of

are also exceptional photographers. Also, thank you to 
Nolan and Brian, who did excellent work this year even 
though I was pretty demanding. Photos are the best part

Regina, I’m sorry for teasing you so much. You made 
production so much better for me on so many days, 
because you really are hilarious. 

Becky, you are absolutely crazy. Thanks for making 
me laugh every time you come in.

Arielle, I’ve always had a lot of respect for you for 

doing almost everything in your section. Good luck 
next year, and I hope you get along well with Rachel. 

Neda, sometimes you seem like a mess, but you 
always manage to pull your section together and pro-
duce something awesome. 

Rachel, I’m so glad you’re here. I knew early on that 
I wanted you to take over next year, and I have com-
plete confidence in you and I’m excited to see what you 
produce.

Hayley and Trevor, thank you for working your way 
through so many sports articles, and trying your best 

every time you had to edit one. 
Finally, Angela, your work ethic knows no bounds. 

You worked so hard for us, and had to put up with all of 
our problems (especially mine) at the same time. I could 
tell you a million times that I appreciate your time and 
effort, and it would still be less than you deserve. 

I wish you all the best next year, and I’ll be sure to

beliefs to get to the goal: to get the A, to get through the 
class period and to get out alive. All my thoughts were 
kept in my head, and didn’t become class discussion 
fodder. When I stepped in that classroom, I went zom-
bie: talked to few, sat in the back corner, never answered 
questions for fear of being wrong (or not being caught 
up with the material), and left when the proverbial bell 
rang. Oh, yeah, when the professor stopped talking — 
no bells in college. 

One class, one assignment and one person changed 
that for me, and I’m sorry it happened so late in the 
game. I met my now-friend Kyle who’s my academic 
opposite: he goes to every one of his professors’ office 
hours every week, he takes classes he doesn’t even 
need to take and he has this zest for college. At first I 
mocked him, and then, I started to envy him. He is truly 
inspired by learning. And then I got this assignment, a 
creative one… This assignment that actually challenged 
me, that actually inspired me, and I wrote 12 pages the 
day before it was due in like six hours. But see, the dif-

ference was, it was only meant to be eight pages. For 
the girl that always did the eight-page minimum on 
those “eight-to-10 page” MMW assignments, this was 
a big deal. I was, for the first time, truly inspired by 
an assignment. And I got my first 100 percent. Now, 
all you bio and engineering majors out there probably 
don’t even remember what getting a 100 percent looks 
like. I certainly didn’t. I looked down at that paper and 
seriously thought, “100? Out of what?” But it changed 
things for me. It made me remember why I loved learn-
ing in the first place, and what college was supposed to 
actually be about. Even though it was a 100 percent, it 
wasn’t about the grade. It was that I was truly inspired 
by an assignment, and my teacher recognized it. I made 
a connection with my teacher without even going to her 
office hours; I connected with the learning process, and 
I grew because of it. I haven’t written a creative thing 
since eighth grade (seven years of writer’s block, three 
months of therapy and yet like what, 50 analytical essays 
throughout college?) and this assignment actually had 
me writing creatively again. It made me remember how 

much I loved it, and has me considering becoming an 
author and writing a novel. (Remember the name guys, 
Naomi Sweo, you might see it in Barnes and Noble one 
day. Or wait— illegally downloaded onto your Kindles, 
I mean.) 

Anyway, from the previously “easy girl,” I want to 
leave you with only this one piece of advice, the most 
important thing I learned in college. Or actually, re-
learned. For all you kids who wanted to be astronauts, 
superheroes and doctors, listen well: Leave behind all 
the Scantrons, leave behind all the tests, leave behind all 
the papers, leave behind all the labs, all the memories 
of the 8 a.m. classes, leave behind all the all-nighters, 
leave behind all the stuff you hated about college and 
remember this one important thing: Go away from this 
with that sense of inspiration. Have a surf shop, start a 
charity, become an accountant, whatever. Find what you 
love, find what inspires you, and chase it. Do it. Don’t 
just go through life to make it out alive. “I HAVE A 
DREAM!” And now I’m going to follow it. I hope to see 
some of you there with me along the way.

June 3 — Rebooting a franchise is always a dicey 
move, but “X-Men” producers decided to skirt that issue by 
using a tried and true method — Mad Men-ing it. Directed by 
Michael Vaughn (of “Kick Ass” fame), the movie is set during 
the Cold War — and, of course, goes to great lengths to pre-
serve historical accuracy by blaming the Cuban Missile Crisis 
on mutants.  
    In addition to setting the film decades before the first 
“X-Men,” the film replaces most of its characters with a new 
cast of less featured mutants, among them Mystique, Beast, 
Banshee and Emma Frost. Of course Professor X (James 
McAvoy of “Atonement” and “Wanted”) and his frenemy 
Magneto (Michael Fassbender of “Inglorious Basterds” and 
“Jane Eyre”) are central components of the film — 2009’s 
“Wolverine: Origins” proved that leaving these key players out 
wasn’t the greatest idea, shirtless Hugh Jackman or not. 

Regardless of which characters you hoped would return, 
the movie promises enough superhero action to keep anybody 
entertained (levitating submarine, anyone?). Whether you are 
a die-hard “X-Men” fan who has dog-eared copies of Ultimate 
X-Men or someone who doesn’t know the difference between 
the Pheonix and the Dark Pheonix — head over to theatres 
and make “X-Men” the first of many franchise reboots that you 
will undoubtedly view this summer. It may end up being the 
best one.  

— Margaret Yau

July 15 — Despite Warner Bros.’ best efforts to 
Petrificus Totalus, their way out of ending this colossal mon-
eymaker, the “Harry Potter” series is coming to a definitive 
close this summer. 

The second half of “Deathly Hallows” picks up where the 
other left off — with the beloved trio, an excruciating hunt 
for Horcruxes and Hallows and a final battle at Hogwarts for 
control over the wizarding world (and thankfully, no more 
of that goddamn camping trip). It should be an exercise in 
special effects that puts “Avatar” to shame: blooming sparks 
of phosphorescent spells and explosions, a monstrous dragon 
and buckets of ruby red blood. It’s not a summer blockbuster 
— it’s the summer blockbuster.

But after a comfortable decade of well-made movies star-
ring the bespeckled teen hero, facing a reality that includes a 
yawning expanse of shitty sequel-cinema with charmers like 
“Transformers: Foxy No More” and “Twilight: Still Sexless” 
makes that final goodbye to Hogwarts only that much more 
bitter than sweet.

And at that midnight hour, wrapped in a robe while 
watching the last Lumos! light up and fade from the cinema 
screen, it’s likely you’ll find yourself wishing for a time-turner 
of your own  — or, at the very least, an encore screening.

June 21 — Justin Vernon’s debut, 2008’s For Emma, 
Forever Ago, is the kind of record that’s indisputably diffi-
cult to follow up. On For Emma (which, in case you’ve been 
ignoring indie folklore for the past few years, was recorded 
in an empty hunting cabin after a particularly difficult break-
up), Vernon combined Spartan production values with the 
kind of relentlessly emotive songwriting that seems impos-
sible to recreate. However, Vernon has somehow one-upped 
himself on this year’s Bon Iver, Bon Iver (to be released June 
21, available for illegal download whenever, thanks to an 
accidental leak by iTunes).

The most immediately noticeable difference between the 
two albums is the production. Where For Emma consisted 
primarily of acoustic guitar, with the occasional touch of 
percussion, this record is adorned with countless yet taste-
ful instrumentation (an approach perhaps encouraged by 
Vernon’s time with Kanye West), from the jukebox slide 
guitar on “Towers” to “Beth/Rest”’s soft rock electric piano 
refrain. See IVER, page 11

Tree of Life

Cars 2

July 8 — Legendary writer/director Terrence 
Mallick ends his six year hiatus with “The Tree of 
Life” — a multi-generational family epic starring 
Brad Pitt and Sean Penn as a father and son living 
in the American midwest. And, satiating the film’s 
already vehement anticipation, Mallick secured the 
coveted Palm d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival 
to exaltations of critical praise and countless Oscar 
nods. The film’s plot, though deliberately ambiguous, 
follows Jack O’Brian (Penn) as he attempts to rec-
oncile with his aggressive, emotionally hostile father 
(Pitt). But, as was the case in Mallick’s earlier classics 
such as “The Thin Red Line,” “Badlands” and “Days 
of Heaven,” the director’s keen eye for breathtaking 
cinematography and meandering, poetic dialogue will 
serve as “The Tree of Life”’s strongest asset.

I’d Rather 
Explore the 
I-5 Than the 
Cosmos

A ccording to Amazon, there are around 238 books about Radiohead. Not just guitar tablature or biogra-
phies, but dense, meticulously researched 
reference books. Books with titles like 

“Radiohead and Philosophy,” “Radiohead 
and the Resistant Concept Album” and 
“Radiohead: Stories Behind Every Song.” 
Books that, I can say with confidence, I 
will never read. 

And the fact that there’s more writ-
ten about this Oxfordshire rock band 
than there is about several respectable 
world countries is indicative of a burning 
question that has kept pale, slightly intro-
verted audiophiles such as myself awake 
at night: How did five human beings cre-
ate something as otherworldly and crush-
ingly beautiful as Kid A — Radiohead’s 
(arguable) masterwork and oft-declared 
greatest album of the last decade.

But as much as Kid A embodies the 
perfect rock album (remarkably unique, 
as pretentious as it is stunning, British), 
and as much I have mulled over its 
complex splendor, I’ve found myself 
invariably drawn to another, simpler and 
(gulp...) altogether better album of the 
incredibly fertile 2000s. 

I had no inherent reason to love Boys 
and Girls in America, the bruised-and-
boozy cult opus from NY bar band the 
Hold Steady. And when I first heard it, I 
didn’t. I was raised by hippie jazz musi-
cians who instilled Coltrane and Scofield, 
rather than Dylan or Springsteen into 
my emergent musical subconscious. But 
after a two-month stint of having Boys 
and Girls as the only playable CD in 
my grandmother-inherited PT Cruiser, 
I slowly became hopelessly devoted to 
lead man Craig Finn’s unbearably hon-
est, Americana-drenched narratives, 
and Franz Nicolay’s smiling, Billy Joel 
key pounding. One night on the I-5, 
somewhere between campus and my 
hometown of Vista, Finn’s quivering final 
lines of Boys and Girls filled me with the 
startling, you’ll-know-it-when-you-feel-it 
sense that this is my favorite record. 

“She was awkward and thoughtful and 
descending into heaven dripping wet.”

Given that Boys and Girls is, musically, 
just plain incredible, the album’s true 
timelessness comes in the earnest rela-
tionship Finn forms with his audience, 
leaving us with the unwavering feeling 
that we’ve known this guy forever. His 
raspy, occasionally giddy vocals are mixed 
relatively low, allowing crashing tides of 
blazing guitar or triumphant horns to 
wash over the names of people and places 
in his elaborate stories, forcing us to fill 
in the blanks. Elsewhere, the familiarity 
is so relentless, it’s eerie. It took me a few 
listens to notice the subtlest of passing 
references to John Darnielle — another 
cult songwriter to which I am religiously 
devoted — midway through “Girls Like 
Status.” 

“Shit,” you begin to think. “This guy 
really knows me.”

And unlike Kid A, Boys and Girls 
doesn’t sound like the future. It sounds 
like Bruce Springsteen, if The Boss was 
funnier, angrier and about six beers in to 
a self-penned epic poem about teenage 
suburbia. Put plainly, it sounds like the 
present. 

But it might just be apples and 
oranges. Radiohead is a band that seems 
intended for copious exploration, in 
the same way that, say astronomy is. 
Listening to Kid A is like staring straight 
into the night sky — vast, astonishingly 
beautiful and ultimately unknown. Boys 
and Girls is turning to your best friend 
who, over a Styrofoam cooler of cheap 
alcohol and a hastily prepared joint, 
clears his throat and begins, “remember 
when...”

Beer and
 Loathing

July 29 — With the seemingly end-
less string of action blockbusters competing 
for movie-goers’ dollars this summer, your 
typical ensemble romcom just got a little more 
refreshing. Crazy, Stupid, Love sports an A-list 
cast including Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, 
Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Kevin Bacon and 
Marisa Tomei. Carell plays Cal, a middle-aged 
sad-sack dealing with an unexpected divorce 
from his cheating wife (Moore). He seeks lady 
help from Jacob (Gosling), a womanizer who 
vows to get Cal his “manhood” back (via a 
classy makeover and a whole lot of clubbing), 

all while having his own shallow perceptions 
of love twisted by the ever-lovely Hannah 
(Stone). 

But Crazy, Stupid, Love isn’t all sappy 
melodrama rehash. The script’s rife with 
one-liners, like when Julianne Moore’s char-
acter says, sobbing, to her ex-husband, “You 
know when I told you I had to work late, I 
really went to see the new ‘Twilight’ movie 
by myself. And it was so bad!” If that’s not 
enough, then let it be put in print that Ryan 
Gosling takes off his shirt. Often.

June 24 — It’s summertime, so like clock-
work, there’s a Pixar movie set for release; this time 
it’s another sequel — the not-really-highly-antici-
pated “Cars 2.” For once, Pixar may not be poised 
for Oscar glory by the end of the year (“Cars” lost 
out to “Happy Feet” for Best Animated Picture in 
2006), though a new globe-trotting premise could 
give the animated franchise new life (and high 
numbers at the box office).

The flick has race-car hero Lightning McQueen 
(Owen Wilson) and rusty truck buddy Mater 
(Larry the Cable Guy) departing the small south-
west American town of Radiator Springs for the 
world’s biggest race, set to take place at an unde-
fined East Asian metropolis. But darker scheming 
is at play, with Mater brought into international 
espionage, including a James Bond-esque Aston 
Martin named Finn McMissile (Michael Caine).

Though the absence of the “Route 66” culture 
may make the film feel like a complete departure 
from the original, the return of McQueen and 
Mater should keep crowds laughing and provide 
another Pixar hit.

Beyoncé

arcade 
fire

yaCHtBrian enoJune 24 — While Beyoncé 
seems to have spent a majority of 
the past couple years since the 2008 
release of I Am … Sasha Fierce fly-
ing under the radar and being crazy 
in love with Jay-Z, the diva has also 
been developing the sound on her 
fourth studio album, the aptly titled 
4.  

On her first single, the up-
tempo “Run the World (Girls),” a 
raspy Beyoncé shouts about female 
empowerment, all set over an altered 
sample of Major Lazer’s “Pon de 
Floor” (the video, which features 
a gladiator-couture B with hyena 
companions, is just as striking as the 
single itself). When she’s not busy 

running the world, the R&B princess 
croons on the buttery-smooth “1+1” 
and laments love lost on her second 
single, the forgettable slow jam “The 
Best Thing I Never Had.” 

Impressions are mixed: The dis-
appointing amount of radio airtime 
doesn’t bode well for Beyoncé   or 
for her fans who were hoping for a 
club jam to whip their hair to. Her 
newfound willingness to experiment 
since parting ways with her father 
and manager Mathew Knowles and 
teaming up with the often grandiose 
producer Kanye West could have the 
makings of the sweetest dream — or 
an unfocused nightmare.

August 2 — Legendary 
indie ensemble Arcade Fire follows 
their critically acclaimed The Suburbs 
with a reissue of the album that 
includes two bonus tracks (“Culture 
War” and David Byrne’s collabora-
tion “Speaking in Tongues”), and 
the highly anticipated Spike Jonze-
directed “Scenes from the Suburbs” 
— a short film and companion to the 
band’s Grammy-winning third album. 
Jonze, who also directed 2009’s 
decidedly not-for-kids existentialist 
beauty “Where the Wild Things Are,” 
highlighted Arcade Fire’s Funeral clas-
sic “Wake Up” in his “Wild Things” 
trailer. His music video for “The 
Suburbs,” comprised of footage taken 
straight from the upcoming 30-min-
ute film, depicts scenes of a group 
of suburban teens who navigate an 

oppressive dystopian landscape on 
BMX bikes. But, considering his 
knack for effortlessly dodging cliches 
(Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), 
Jonze will undoubtedly turn the film’s 
focus from the spectacle of masked, 
gun-wielding officers and patrolling 
helicopters to its beautiful cinema-
tography and remarkably human 
characters.

July 5 — Last year, Brian 
Eno released Small Craft on a Milk 
Sea — a collection of understated 
instrumental compositions that 
infused Eno’s trademark dreamy 
ambiance with a much-needed 
sense of edge, though the album 
failed to reach the sublime heights 
of the musician’s earlier work. 
Untamed electric guitar licks 
brushed up against relentless 
motorik drumming and blasts of 
distortion, creating captivating, off-
beat waves among Eno’s otherwise 
serene soundscapes. 

Eno continues to explore this 
streak of (slight) dissonance in 
Drums Between the Bells, in col-
laboration with poet Rick Holland. 
In Drums, other vocalists (includ-
ing Eno himself) recite Holland’s 
poetry, spoken-word style, over 
Eno’s expansive electronic compo-
sitions. If initial single “Glitch” is 
any indication, Eno’s planning on 
revisiting the dense polyrhythms 
he explored on 1981’s David Byrne 
collaboration, My Life in the Bush 
of Ghosts. Good news if you plan 
to spend your summer driving 
around in your car to futuristic 
ambient funk grooves while listen-
ing to several elderly British men 
recite postmodern poetry (we 
know we are).

June 21 — YACHT’s last 
album, 2009’s See Mystery Lights, 
was an unexpected hit — a collec-
tion of irresistible 
electro anthems that 
solidified YACHT’s 
place as twentieth-
century inheritors of 
the downbeat dance 
groove legacy estab-
lished by Tom Tom 
Club’s “Genius of 
Love” and Talking 
Heads’ “This Must Be the Place.” It’s 
then a welcome sentiment that the 
bouncy Portland electro-pop collec-
tive is releasing their follow-up, the 
sci-fi referencing Shangri-La, in the 
summertime. 

You can expect the band’s tight 
disco beats to be more developed 
and even groovier, like on Shangri-
La’s superb lead single “Dystopia 

(The Earth is On 
Fire).” On that 
track, the band’s 
slick, mantra-
espousing jams are 
supplemented by 
a new willingness 
to step away from 
the bare-bones 
synth blips of 

Mystery Lights, experimenting with 
dense textures, vocal harmonies and 
somewhat darker subject matter. 

— Andrew Whitworth
Senior Staff Writer

Moments like the gently 
interlocking fingerpicked guitar 
on “Minnesota, WI,” the psyche-
delic sound collage underlying 
“Hinnom, TX” or, memora-
bly, the slightly metal-minded 
double-kick-drum-and-electric-
guitar onslaught halfway through 
“Perth” make Bon Iver, Bon Iver 
both memorable and endlessly 
replayable.

Vernon’s songwriting is more 
developed, too. Even if none of 
these tracks reach the vulnerable 
heights of “Skinny Love” or “RE: 
Stacks,” it’s clear that Vernon 
has a sense of melodic expres-

sion that’s unparalleled by his 
contemporaries. The cathartic 
quasi-squeals at the end of each 
of “Michicant”’s verses, for exam-
ple, sound miles away from For 
Emma’s relatively conventional 
melodicism. 

Vernon’s simple narratives 
of love-gone-wrong have been 
replaced by complex, exception-
ally literary lyrics. “Break the 
sailor’s table on your sacrum 
/ fuck the fiercest fables, I’m 
with Hagen,” reads the bridge 
on “Tower” — exemplifying the 
songwriter’s move from standard 
folk to stream-of-consciousness 
tableaux. 

Most importantly, Bon Iver, 
Bon Iver is a personally rewarding 
listening experience.  Vernon’s 
lived-in melodies and ornate 
songwriting have the power to lift 
you from that cabin in the woods 
and transport you to strange and 
absolutely stunning new places, 
making for what will surely be 
the most thoughtful (and great-
est) album of the summer.

BEST COACH / MANAGER

BEST BREAKOUT ATHLETE

Annette Ilg spent four years making her name as a leader on the women’s basketball team, and in fact received an honorable mention in 
last year’s edition of these awards in the Guardian. But 
when the graduate student aged out, becoming ineli-
gible to play another year with coach Charity Elliott, 
Ilg made the switch from the court to the pitch, and 
was invited to join the women’s soccer team. Making a 
seamless transition, Ilg earned her way into the starting 
eleven by midseason and eventually became an instru-
mental piece in the Triton attack. Ilg’s speed off the ball 
and nose for the goal made her a lethal striker in the 
Triton’s postseason run. By the end of the season, Ilg 

led the team in goals and was also named the CCAA newcomer of the year.

Gerckens began her softball coaching career at UCSD 19 years ago. In the subsequent seasons, Gerckens accumulated a 440-420 
record, though the lackluster record couldn’t convey 
Gerckens’ talent as a manager. In the Tritons’ champi-
onship postseason run this year, Gerckens showed an 
uncanny knack for picking exactly the right pinch hit-
ter and utilizing the perfect pinch runners. The man-
ager always found a way around the Tritons’ offensive 
shortcomings — whether calling for the squeeze play 
or tweaking the batting order — to lead her team to 
the program’s first ever NCAA Division II title.

BEST MOMENT

The women’s water polo team went an abysmal 0-14 against ranked opponents during the regular season. Nevertheless, they made it to the conference championship, but had to face No. 8 Loyola Marymount. The 
winner would take the WWPA title and the automatic berth to the NCAA tour-
nament that came with it. LMU had already beaten UCSD earlier in the season, 
and the conference championship looked as if it would also go Loyola’s way. The 
Tritons were down 10-8 early in the fourth quarter, but goals from Jessica Tran 
and Hanalei Crowell tied the game. The two teams scored a goal apiece to even 
the score at 11, but goals from Crowell and Katherine Biehle gave the Tritons a 
13-11 advantage. UCSD scored six goals in the final stanza — including three 
from Tran — and pulled away to stun Loyola and win UCSD’s first conference 
title since 2000.

FRESHMAN OF THE YEAR

Sarah Lizotte excelled as soon as she entered UCSD, quickly becoming a key member of the women’s water polo team and helping them 
finish seventh in the nation. The Riverside, Calif. 
native was third on the team with 46 goals while also 
compiling 21 assists. She was awarded the WWPA 
Player of the Week on April 13, after tallying 12 goals 
in four games to lead her team to a 3-1 record at the 
Bronco tournament at Santa Clara. Plus, with star 
Hanalei Crowell graduating, Lizotte guarantees that 
the Tritons will be stocked with valuable talent for 
years to come.

OUTSTANDING TEAM

Already the defending national champion in the javelin throw, Howe 
retained his title on his first 
attempt at the national meet. His 
mark of 231’3” blew away the 
competition and secured his sec-
ond straight title — the only two 
UCSD has on the men’s side in 
Division II. Howe also compet-
ed in the high jump this season, 
garnering a second-place fin-
ish at the conference meet. And 
Howe’s season is not finished: His 

throw qualified him for the USA Outdoor Track & Field 
Championships in June, where he’ll compete against America’s 
top throwers in Eugene, Ore.

soFtBAll For a team picked to finish fifth in the confer-ence, UCSD softball not only beat the odds, they shattered both records and expectations. This 
season the UCSD softball team won the regular season 
championship, going 22-10 (the best record in program 
history), claimed the top spot in the West region (for 
the first time in school history) and became the NCAA 
Division II champions — going 4-0 in the national 
tournament — to give UCSD its first NCAA title since 
2001 and third since joining Division II. The team was 
full of underclassmen and had very little postseason 
experience, but the Tritons played like seasoned pros 

and found ways to win tight games. The team also boasts 
two NFSCA Division II All-Americans in junior pitcher 
Camille Gaito and senior Kris Lesovsky. Gaito pitched 
every inning of the NCAA tournament, and allowed just 
six runs in the 28 innings. UCSD finished the season at 
45-13 overall, easily eclipsing the previous program best 
of 34. The Tritons have found well-earned respect, and 
will go into the next season ranked No. 1 in the nation.

Without a doubt, Fogarty is the fastest woman ever to compete for UCSD. She pocketed both the 100- and 200-meter school records 
as an underclassman and went on to improve those 
times dramatically. She became an elite sprinter, and 
is on the cusp of qualifying for the USA Track & Field 
Championship Meet. She leaves with personal bests 
of 11.52 in the 100 and 23.55 in the 200, and was an 
All-American in both events each of the last two years. 
What is most impressive is that her times stand far out 
from any UCSD athlete that came before her, and her 

records are likely to stand for years to come.

BEST CHAMPIONSHIP PERFORMANCEBEST GRADUATING SENIOR

After taking home his first national title on the first day of the meet, Matt Herman decided he needed another and won a second one two 
days later. He won the 1000-freestyle with a three-
second cushion on the first day, fighting off some 
fatigue at the 500 mark. He then came back and won 
the 1650-freestyle, once again getting off to a strong 
start and holding off the field. Impressively, Herman 
was seeded fifth and second in the events coming into 
the meet, with significant gaps to the top-seeded swim-
mers. But Herman’s gritty performance saw him walk 
away with a pair of NCAA titles.

This season, pitcher Camille Gaito became the win-ningest pitcher in UCSD 
history (35-4), making 47 appear-
ances for the Tritons. The junior 
is without a doubt the best pitcher 
the school has ever seen, and now 
with a national title under her belt, 
she is arguably the best Division 
II pitcher in the nation. As an 
NSFCA Division II All-American 
and the best pitcher in the West 
region, Gaito threw every inning 
of every game for the Tritons. 
Standing just 5’4”, Gaito clearly 
established herself as the most dominant arm in Division II 
softball, ending the season with the second lowest ERA in the 
nation (.75), while also leading her team to their first ever 
national championship.

The Guardian Honors

After a rough start to the season, the men’s soccer team went on a six-game unbeaten streak before running into No. 14 Chico State. Following 
a back-and-forth first half, UCSD went up 1-0 just 
after the halftime whistle, thanks to a rebound goal off 
the foot of senior defender and captain Jared Kakura. 
Chico came alive after going down, and the Tritons had 
to withstand heavy pressure from the visitors. Chico 
striker Ferid Celosmanovic leveled the score in the 
62nd minute after the Tritons were unable to clear the 
ball, and the flamboyant player struck again to give the 

Wildcats the lead in the 88th minute. The game seemed 
over for the Tritons, and Chico looked set to walk away 
as deserved winners. But less than 60 seconds later mid-
fielder David Bakall headed in a cross from defender 
Cory Wolfram to tie the game at 2-2 and force extra 
time. In the 100th minute, Kakura found the golden 
goal after a scramble in the box and sealed a dramatic 
comeback win.
