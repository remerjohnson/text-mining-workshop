RIVERSIDE - UC River-
side received $10 million 
from the Ford Motor Com-
pany to research techniques 
in air pollution reduction. The 
donation will fund research to 
reduce vehicle emissions, 
develop alterna'tive-fueled 
vehicles, create intelligent 
highway systems and study 
transportation modeling. The 
research facility employees 
80 people, but will grow to 
100 by the end of the year. 
The $10 million dollar 
contribution is the third multi-
million dollar endowment 
made to UCR in the last year. 

UCD Charged with

animals in a Davis research 
facility. The West Davis 
Community Association 
charged that the South Davis 
Center for Neuroscience 
pursued illegal and hazardous 
policies. Evidence was 
presented before Judge 
Thomas Warriner of Yolo 
County Unified Court Sept. 
29. As of yet, there is no 
verdict. Currently, the center

LOS ANGELES - The 
stereotype of the starving 
student does not apply to 
most UCLA students accord-

Research Study. The study 
found that UCLA students 
have a monthly disposable 
income double that of the 
national average. On average, 
UCLA students have $317 in 
discretionary funds per 
month, and four percent of 
the students have over $1,000 
per month. The national 
average is $150 per month.

Internet Access Focus of Conference 
DATA: Accessibility a 
major issue as 'Net' 
continues to expand 
By Ivan Delv8nthal 
Staff Writer 

The Computer Professionals for 
Social Responsibility (CPSR), an 
organization dedicated to under-
standing the impact of computers on 
society, held its annual meeting last 
weekend at UCSD. 

This year's convention focused 
on the issue of accessibility to the 
National Information Infrastructure 
(Nil), which participants addressed 
as a major problem facing the 
Internet community. 

In an attempt to represent a vari-
ety of perspectives, organizers of 
the two-day forum invited two dozen 
computer professionals from a num-
ber of fields, including medicine, 
law, science and communications. 

The conference's keyn ote 

speaker, UCSD Assistant Professor 
of Communications Fran~ois Bar, 
discussed accessibility as the key 
for a thriving "Information Super-
highway." 

"The success of the Internet is 
based on the interaction of a vast 
multitude of users," Bar said. " It is 
critical that there be universal ac-
cess to the Internet. More people 
must become involved in its evolu-
tion because they all have some-
th ing to contribute," Bar added. 

Approximately 150 spectators, 
most of them computer profession-
als, attended a panel discussion 
about the various social, techno-
logical and institutional meaning 
entailed in the concept of "access." 

Larry Shaw, a panel member 
with a background in physics and 
has worked at the Exploratorium in 
San Franci co for 20 years, di -

Scientists Go Out on 
A Limb for DNA 
CHIMPS: Researchers use new technique, extract 
DNA from hair, avoiding blood and tissue samples 
By Marianne Villi 
Associate News Editor 

When studying chimpanzees, do 
as the chimpanzees do, which, in the 
case of a team of UCSD biologists 
and anthropologists, meant climb-
ing trees. The group of researchers 
traveled to Africa in pursuit of ge-
net ic clues hidden in 

funding for his research, which was 
finally provided by the National 
Science Foundation and the National 
I nstitute of Health. 

Morin, Moore and several others 
then traveled to the Gombi National 
Park in Tanzania in 1991 , and stud-
ied the group of chimps made fa-

mous by re-
the hair of chimpan-
zees. 

UCSD biologists 
David Woodruff and 
Phillip Morin , along 
with anthropologist 
Jim Moore, studied 
D A strands ex-
tracted from chim-
panzee hair in an at-
tempt to learn theevo-
lutionary history and 
mati ng behavior of 
these endangered pri-
mate . 

"I had been 
working on 
the genetics of 
endangered 
species, deer 
and rhlnocerous, 
and It was 
clearly quite 
difficult to iet 
blood samples 
from these 

searcher Jane 
Goddall. " We 
used this group of 
chimpanzees be-
cause they had all 
been identified 
and studyed for so 
man y yea rs," 
Woodruff said. 

The sc ientists 
spent two months 
in Africa - the 
first month was 
spent obta ining 
perm its and paper-
work and the sec-
ond was spent re-
trieving chimpan-
zee hair. 

Each evening 
Morin and Moore 
watched the 
chimps build their 
nightly tree-top 
nests. The follow-
ing morning, the 
researchers would 
return and collect 
the hairwhic-h had 

The researchers 
u ed a new type of 
genetic research that 
does not require blood 
or ti ss ue samples 
from the animals. "I 
had been working on 
the genetics of endan-
gered species, deer 
and rhinoceros, and it 
was clearly quite dif-
fic u It to get blood 
samples from these 
animals in the wild," 
Woodruff said . '" wa

animals In the 
Wild." been left behind. 

-David Woodruff Though some 
UCSD researcher nests were only 

eight feet off the 
them ." 

It was at thi s time that a new 
approach to genetic research was 
discovered. "Inabout 1987,a woman 
at Berkeley fou nd that you could get 
DNA from hai r," Woodruff aid. 

Woodruff and Morin we nt to 
Berkeley with samples of chimpan-
zee hair and fo und that the new 
technique worked as well as blood 
or tissue testing. 

In 1989, another key discovery 
was. made in the field of genetic 
research. "Three groups around the 
world al most simultaneousl y d iscov-
cred a new class of va riable nuclear 
gene that was easier to extract and 
much more accurate," Woodruffsaid 

Woodruff wanted to study how 
chimpanzees in the wild wcre reÂ· 
lated to each other. "U p until this 
point, we didn't know who the fa -
thers were," hesaid. "Wecould study 
the chimp's behavior and get an 
idea of who they might be, but be-
cause female chimps do not mate 
with just one male, it was impos-
sible to prove," Woodruff added. 

With thi s goal in mind, Woo-
druff spent one year trying to obtain 

ground, others reached heights of 
over 60 feet . 

When the DNA was later ex-
tracted at the Muir Biology labora-
tories, researchers discovered that 
the male chimps of the group were 
more closely related than the fe-
males. The study supported the idea 
that kin selection accounts for the 
evolution of cooperati ve behvaior 
among male chimps. 

Researchers also discovered that 
chimpanzees, like humans, are highly 
geneticall y variable . The finding was 
especially important in relation to 
the subspecies of West African 
chimps, which researchers believe 
to be an independent species. 

This discovery could be very 
important in the conservation oflhe 
West African chimpanzee popula-
tion because, "at thi s point, the West 
African chimp is the rarest. They 
won't see another 20 years at this 
rate of poaching and hunting," Woo-
druff explained. 

Woodruffsaid, however, that the 
National Institutes of Health re-
search guidelines which treat the

SIO Professor 'Awarded Medals 
John Orcutt. a professor of geophysics at UCSD's 

Scripps Institution of Oceanography, will receive the 
1994 Maurice Ewing Medal from the United States 
Navy and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) for 
outstanding marine research. 

Orcutt will be given the award at the Annual Fall 
Meeting of the American Geophysical Union In San 
Francisco in December. 

According to AGU officials, Orcutt was chosen for 
his "significant contributions to understanding physiÂ· 
cal, geophysical and geological processes in the 
ocean.Â· His research focuses on the structure of the 
earth beneath the seafloor, particularly in areas where 
the boundaries of the earth's crust create volcanic 
activity and seafloor spreading. 

Orcutt came to Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
in 1973 as a graduate student and is now the director 
of Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary PhysÂ· 
ics. 

UCSD Study Finds Key to PostÂ· 
Hysterectomy Depression 

The depression that often follows a hysterectomy 
is not from the hysterectomy itself but from the 
simultaneous removal of both ovaries and the uterus 
according to a UCSD study. ' 

The study, which was published in the current issue 
of the Journal of Women 's Health, found that women 
who had their uteruses removed but the ovaries left 
intact were no more likely to become depressed than 
women who went through natural menopause. 

However, 50 percent more cases of depression 
were found among women who had both their uteruses 
and ovaries removed. 

The depression is probably caused by a sudden 
drop in the hormone estrogen, which is produced by 
the ovaries, said Donna Kritz-Silverstein, an epidemiÂ· 
ologist who headed the study. 

The study involved 1,074 women from a 2(}year 
health study of 5,000 Rancho Bernardo residents . 

Guarneri Sbing Quartet to

In 1982, New York City Mayor Ed Koch presented 
the quartet with the New York City Seal of Recognition 
and in 1992, the ensemble became the only quartet to 
be given the Award of Merit from the Association of 
Performing Arts Presenters . 

Peter Dennis' Winnie the Pooh 
Performance Returns to UCSD 

America's most popular storybook bear is returning

UCSD Gets New Arts Dean INTERNET: speakers voiced optimism regarding the fu-ture of the Internet 
ADMINIiTHAnON: Dean 
faces challenge of budget cuts 
and understaffed department 

all departments are working properly. "We 
have to be sure that each department is offer-
ing the classes required," Deak said. 

COIlIlo, â¢â¢ d from ..... 1 
lema of accessibility. 

"We can no longer consider ourselves 
constrained by geographic boundaries," 
Felsenstein said. "The definition of the word 
'community' has changed forever. It now 
stands for a group of people communicating 
on a regular basis," Felsenstein added. 

"It's not just about access," Shaw said. 

Dcak stressed his belief that "the arts di-
rectly .influence our life on campus and our 
relationship to the mmmunity," and wants to 
increase the number and visibility of arts 
events within the campus commmunity. 

"It's also about understanding the informa-
tion provided." 

ByMuM â¢ ...., 
Starr Writer 

Several speakers refuted the concept of 
universal access, claiming that data traffic 
on the Internet is already too heavy. 

Most participants agreed that the Internet 
is a vital tool for broadening people's minds. 
Although geographic and social conditions 
may limit what people sec everyday, the 
Internet presents opportunities for discover-
ing the diversity outside physical realms, 
several participants said. 

As newly appointed dean of the Divison of 
Arts and Humanities, Frantisek Deak faces 
the challenge of budget cuts and understaffed 
departments. 

Among his ideas that Dcak would like to 
incorporate isa dean's lecture series to expose 
the UCSD and La Jolla communities to the 
work of the arts faculty. "I really want to 
create a situation to make it possible to im-
prove the intellectual and artistic atmosphere 
of the campus," Deal. said. 

"The Internet is not for. all," said Lee 
Felsenstein, senior researcher at Interval 
Research Corporation in Palo Alto. "It is a 
high stratum of communication. 

Deak, the former theater department chair, 
filled the position on July 1, following the 
departure of Stanley Chodorow, who was 
appointed provost at the University of Penn-
sylvania last June. 

As one of the four divisional deans at 
UCSD, Deak is faced with "a number of 
issues, many of which have to do, of course, 
with budget cuts to the division." One of 
Dcak's main focuses is to address the recent 
loss of faculty in the departments he over-
sees. 

Aside from overseeing and coordinating 
the three main arts departments, Dcak also 
oversees Subjcct A and mathematics testing, 
and heads most of the interdisciplinary fields 
of study, such as Chinese, Japanese and other 
cultural studies programs. 

"Rather, we should be focusing on the 
'Intranet,' a more grassroot kind of network 
giving people access to one another," 
Felsenstein added. Felsenstein is well-known 
in the computer industry for his role in 
designing several e.arly personal computer 
systems in 1975 and 1976. 

However, most of the speakers 
rearticulated the fundamental principles set 
forth by the CPSR charter that, "The success 
of the NIl (National I nformation I nfrastruc-
ture) program will depend on the extent to 
which it empowers all citizens ... and 
strengthens the democratic institutions on 
which this country was founded." 

Tbe three art departments, visual arts, theÂ· 
atre and music, have lost ~3 faculty members 
in the last four years, and 17 faculty members 
last year. Deak said he is concerned about the 
high rate of attrition of the arts faculty. 

Dcak was born in the former Czechoslova-
kia, where he also studied theater and re-
ceived a masters in fine arls. Deak earned his 
doctorate at Carnegie-Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh and was later involved in drama 
and playwriting in New York. 

Karen Coyle, a system analyst with the 
University of California's on-line library 
system talked about her disillusion with the 
NII."As far as I'mconcerned, the Internet is 
a piece of federal vaporware .... If it isn't 
accessible, it isn't information," Coyle said. 

Founded in 1981 , Computer Profession-
als for Social Responsibility is a national, 
non-profit organization dedicated to under-
standing the impact of computers on soci-
ety. Today, CPSR has \ ,800 members and 
21 chapters across the United States.

since the inception of the Nil, many of the

many UCSD arls programs in the last few 
years, Dealt said that he needs be certain that 

In 1974, Dcak came to UCSD as an asso-
ciate professor in theatre and theatre history, 
and was eventually promoted to professor and 
chair of the dePartment.

Commentaries: Is Proposition 187 Califomias answer to illegal immigration? 
â¢ 

Taxes should be spent on U.S. citizens 
By Anna V.lam.n 
Opinion Editor 

The government is finally focusing its atten-
tion on the ever-increasing flood of illegal im-
migrants into the United States. 

Proposition 187, the "Save Our State" initia-
tive which would revise current immigration 

laws, would exclude undocumented immigrants 
from publicly funded social services, health 
care and education. 

Opponents of Proposition 187 claim it is 
unnecessary to exclude undocumented immi-
grants from public social services, such IS wel-
fare, because they are already excluded 
from the vast majority of 
them. However, this 

Although Proposition 187 is important for 
all states on the U.S.-Mexican border, it is 
especially crucial for CUfomia. Acx:ording to 
the Immigration Naturalization Service (INS), 
as of 1992, nearly 50 percent of the 3.4 million \:~~1::::i~::::t ___ ~illegal immigrants in the United States reside

Measure 
divisive, 

mean-spirited 
By DouI Alex'" 
Senior Staff Writer 

1be vole's in: Our esteemed governor, Pete 
Wilson, bas officially been declared a persotlll 
notI grills in Tijuana. Angered by Wilson's 
cynicalcampaignagainst"iIIegals,"theTijuana 
City Counci~ backed by an amy of business, 
church and activist leaders, passed a resolution 
last Thursday declaring that California's highcst 
official is" no longer welcome in its city. Though 
Wilson won't be greeted by gun-toting police 
and deported back to the United States if he hops 
the Iron Curtain, he won't be greeted by parades 
or smiling officials, either. 

The resolution, symbolic though it may be, 
should serve as a waite-up call to Ca1ifor-

nians.Itnotonly ref1ccts achasm between 
Gov. Wilson and the Tijuana elite, but 

reemerging tensions between Mexico 
and the United States. As a casual 
browsing of Mexican media indi-
cates, Mexicans have become in-
creasingly angry at the politics of el 
norte, commonly using terms like 
"xenophobic" and "racist" when dis-
cussing California's debate on illegal 
immigration. 

And for good reason. In the last six 
months, California's anti-illegal immi-

grant movement has become increasingly 
shrill, spawning the most Draconian lOti-

immigration measure California bas seen in a 
decade - Proposition 187, the so-called "Save 
Our State" initiative. 

Drafted by "concerned" California natives, 
who, in the words of the proposition, " ... have 
suffered and are suffering economic hardship 
caused by the presence of illegal a1iens in this 
state," Proposition 187 seeks to eliminate all 
public services, including education and health 
care, for illegal immigrants. 

Though proponents' "They're-kiUing-our-
state-and-taltiD8-our-joba" rhetoric has struck a 
nerve in many Californians, it's largely bisect on 
false uawnptiOIlB about illegal immigrants.

Opponents also claim tha alleged

that they are undocumented, before

Also, you cannot gauge the guer-

Continued occupation without

democrats are turning their backs on

immigrition laws and must legalize

The proposal provides not only the 
opportunity to prove one's right to 
remain in the United States, but also a 
chance for illegal immigrants to legal-
ize their status. 

The idea that Proposition 187 will 
delay services to legal citizens with an 
unnecessary and time-c:onsuming veri-

except in the case of an emergency. If, 
for example, an undocumented immi-
grant is dying, he will not be denied the 
necessary treatment to keep him alive. 
But if he has a cold, he can be treated in 
his own country. It is unnecessary for. 
U.S. citizens to pay for illegal immi-

Asforundocumentedchildrenhav-
ing a right to public education, this is 
nothingbutasave-the-children-of-our-
helpless-immigrants whine of worry-

label them insensitive. Proposition 187 
would overturn Plyer v. Doe, a ] 982 
Supreme Court case which ruled un-
documented children deserve a public 
education. Contrary to whalopponeots 
of Proposition 187 would have the 

their lOti-war sentiments of the Viet-
nam era. 

Economic and military resources 
will be drained in along-termoccupa-
tion of Haiti - and loll of life will 
make it a national ~tion (an-
other Vietnam). Opportunists in 
Bosnia, North Korea, Iraq and Iran 
will then pm:eive our preoccupations 
have stretched us too thin to exercise 
clout. 

As to the political boost of this 
military accomplishment: victories do 
not reelect presidents. 

Operation Desert Storm did not 
save Bush. But a protracted police 
action can ruin a president - remem-
ber Vietnam began as a military ex-
periment and transformed Lyndon 
Johnson's political career from land-
slide victory to liability within his 

public believe, the Supreme Court's 
ruling on Plyer v. Doe was a mistake. 
Illegal-immigrant parents are not con-
cerned about their children's educa-
tion, but rather their children's free 
education. 

Opponents also argue that the ini-
tiative would deny intelligent chil-
dren an education. However, for each 
student who is brilliant, thousands are 
mediocre or below-average. 

The intelligence of a child is not 
what's at stake, but rather the right 
of American citizens to have their 
tax money go to where it belongs-
with other American citizens. ille-
gal immigrants are just using the 
system to their advantage - they 
break the law to get something for 
nothing. 

own party. 
So, Mr. President, remember the 

slogan "Bring the troops home" and 
do it by your own reckoning and not 
by public: protest later down the road.

need to set our priorities straight, and

â¢ Moat studies CIItirMte thai ille-
gal immigrants are a net gain &0 the 
u.s. economy. Aa:ording &0 a 1990 
report by the Prwideot's CouDciI of 
Emnomic Affain 011 IepI and ille-
gal imJni&raIion. "numerous lllUdies 
suggat tbIa the Iong-nm benefits of 
immigration grady exceed any short-
run COIItI. The UASkiIled jobs taken 
by immigruds in years past have 
often complemented the skiUed jobs 
typically filled by tbe native-bom 
population, increasing employment 
and income for the population as a 
whole." 

Regardless of their lack of docu-
mentation, many illegal immigrants 
pay income tax (without filing, there-
fore foregoing tax returns), and virtu-
ally all consume U.S. goods and pay 
sales taxes. However, because thefed-
era! government absorbs most of their 
taxes while covering very few of their 
costs, undocumented immigrants do 
exact an expense on California state 
and local govemmenlS. Gov. Wilson 
claims they cost the state nearly $3 
billion annually, though most experts 
believe his arithmetic is worse than 

. faulty. 
But government costs don 't count 

the unaccountable: The state's deep 
economic dependence on cheap, eas-
ily exploitable undoeumented labor. 
~veral California industries, includ-
ing agricultural and apparel indus-
tries, are bui It 00 the baclts of illegal 
immigrants and would be hard-hit if 
they suddenly 'disappeared.' Pete 
Wilson knows this well. Before 
California's economy plummeted 
and he began his policy of zero toler-
ance, Wilson, like many business-
wise conservatives, was a gung-ho 
supporter of a free-flowing Califor-
nia border. 

o Contrary to popular opinion, cur-
rent federal and state law alJady re-
stric:t .. iJlegals" from tbe vast majority 
of public services, including food 
stamps and welfare. Although the fed-
eral government has established a 
high-tech system ofenforoement,most 
states don't bother because they've 
found it costs more than it saves. 
People migrate from Mexico and Cen-
tral America for living-wage jobs and 
political security, not "cushy" wel-
fare benefits or "world~Iass" public 
health care. 

Despite the facts, many residents 
continue to believe that illegal aliens 
are killing California, depleting its 

raoun::a and "conuptiag" its cul-
tunlltatus quo. Although aImoat ev-
eryone .... thai iUepl immigra-
tion ila problem, its mapitude bas 
been wildly exagerated and 11_ 
so have its "solutions." 

ProposiIion 187, perbIps the DICIt 
Draconian m such "lOlutions, .. is IXlt 
only wroag-helded and dangaous, 
but would COlt the scate billions of 
dollars to enfortc while doing liIde 10 
"keepthem damned ilJegals out ofour 
state." 

Most troubling. the proposition 
would attempt to deny elementary 
and secondary education to "illegal" 
children. ~rding to the proposal, 
begiMing JanJ, 199!!, each school 
district must verify the legal status of 
all newly enrolled children. By Jan. I, 
1995, the proposition tightens the 
screws: schools must verify the legal 
status of childrens ' parents or guard-
ians as well. 

Though this provision violates the 
U.S. Constitution under the 1982 Su-
preme Court ruling Plyer v. Doe, 
which recognizes undocumented 
children 's right to public education, 
proponents assert that Proposition 
187 would challenge and possibly 
topplePlyer. While it's unlikely Plyer 
would beovertumed, Proposition 187 
would guarantee a nasty and costly 
legal battle_ 

If proponents had their way, how-
ever, California's "iIIegals" would be 
thrown out of school and relegated to 
America's underclass-uneducatcd,. 
doomed to poverty and, more than 
likely th:ut not, criminal. While the 
authors of 187 claim "that they have 
suffered and are suffering personal 
injury and damage caused by theaimi-
naI oondud of iJlepl aliens," by at-
tempting to deny "iUegals" the most 
buic of skills and education they are 
only throwing gasoline onto the 
flames. 

To enforce its anli-education 
policy, the proposition would enlist 
It.IChers and administrators in its fight 
against immigrants, forcing them to 
report "iUegal" children and their par-
ents to state and federal officials, 
Whether they know it or not..by pro-
posing such a measure, these mad-u-
hell Americ::ans are tinkering with the 
mechanics of a police slate. 

Not surprisingly, such a policy is 
illegal, violating the federal Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy AI:!. 
(FERPA), which prohibits di1closure 
of virtually all information about pub-
lic school students. The adoption of 
the leIcher-u-police provision would

In keeping with its punitive mil-
sion,Propositioa 187 would aIsodeny 
undocumented immigranll all "non-
aneageucy" medical care. Undertbia 
especially auel and danprouI provi-
sion, undocumented citizall - in-
cIuctin& children - would be con-
demoed to live without the IDOIt buic 
heatlth services, Iurting not only its 
intended targets. but aJao the public 
which the proposition is suppoaedly 
meant 10 "save," Hone QOnsiders that 
"illegal" children would not be eli-
gible for immunization or that "ille-
gaI"women would be denied prenatal 
care, it's not diffiadt to imagine the 
horrifIC potential of Proposition 187_ 
It would, quite literally, be a public 
health disaster. 

And to ensure immigrants don't 
steal state health care, the measure 
seeks 10 break doctor-patient confi-
dentiality by mandating that doctors 
-liketeachers-report "suspected" 
illegal immigrants to the proper au-
thorities. While any doctor worth the 
paper on which her degree is printed 
would reject any such demand, it 
would nonetheless provide a power-
ful incentive for "ilIegals" to avoid 
hospitals at all costs - even in the 
worst emergency situations. 

Proposition 187 would propel us 
backward SO years, setting up an im-
migration police lUte with little COD-
cmt for "liberal" issues like mrwbtu-
tionallaw and due process. Creating. 
new, deluded definition of "reason-
able suspicion," Proposition 187 
would loosen the reigns of the Immi-
gration Naturalization Service (INS) 
and other i.nunigntion Iawenfort:erS, 
making it frighteningly easy for them 
&0 detain and anal any "suspicious-
looking," broWlHkinnod resident. 

Below the mask of civility and 
mushy liberal ta1kabout how we "just 
can't afford illepl immigrants," it's 
dear thai proponents of the melSure 
want blood. And if CalifomiaM pass 
this proposition, that's exactly what 
they'll get. But Ca1ifomianswon'tget 
a measure which will stem the tide of 
illegal immigration and they certainly 
won't get a measure which will save 
them money. At an estimated S1!! 
billion to enforce, Proposition 187 is 
an awfully high price to pay simply to 
punish "them damned iUegm."

come to them for sponsorship. " 

The event was sponsored by 
the ASUCSD, Campus Recre-
at ion, Dining Services, Univer-
sity Events Office (UEO), Kaplan 
and the five colleges. 

Garcia said that more student 
groups participated in this year's 
event than in previous years, in 
part because organizations asso-
ciated with the individual col-
leges were mvited to for the first 
time. 

A stage was erected for perfor-
mances by several student groups 
throughout the day. The local band 
Blacksmith Union performed at 
the end of the day-long even!. 

Most students were enthusi-
astic about the event. Muir Col-
lege sophomore Timory Roeh, a 
member of the Radically Inclined 
to Ski Club said that she discov-
ered the organization at FFOG 
last year. 

"UCSD is too big of a school 
to gather together," Roch said, 
and added that FFOG is helpful in 
familiarizing students with many 
of the student organizations. 

"We had a lotofpeoplegradu-
ate and this is a good way to find 
some energetic new people to 
join," said Third College senior 
Ian Johnston, of Student Envi-
ronmental Action Coalition. 

Adam Tilghman, a sen ior at 
Warren and member of the 
Darkstar Club, a science fic tion,

said that, at last year 's event, the

bers. Darkstar members said 
they were anticipating to do the

Stephanie Barker, a senior at

Society, said t hat this is her 
organizatio n' s fi rst yea r at 

FFOG. She said she was hoping to

Other students were not as im-
pressed wi th the showing. " I don' t 
think they have that much," said Dan 
Ja rv is, a jun ior at Warren , referring to 
the variety of organizations. There 
are a lot of "different clubs that do the

SAUTER: 
Speaker urges voter 
participation 
ContInued from pee. 1 
core source of information and 
knowledge, because i1 is a commer-
cially run system," Saulcr said, add-
ing that television tel1ds to distort 
the news. 

Sauler is traveling the lecture 
circuit to campaign for his wife and 
also 10 urge students to exercise 
their voting rights. regardless of their 
political views, he said. 

"If there is any segment of the 
population today [which] has a 
vested interest in our future, it is 
you, because if you don' t vo te, I 
will ," Sauter said, adding Ihat the 
small percentage of the population 
to which he belongs - older, white 
profess ionals - is increasingly 
becomming the domi nant voting 
group. 

According 10 Sauter, it is dan-
gerous for such a small group of 
Americans to make the political de-
cisions for the entire country, add-
ing that it will only alienate the rest 
of the population from the political 
process. 

Sauter also said it is increasingly 
difficult to maintain public interest 
in politics as political parties de-
cline in integrity and sports figures , 
mass murderers and celebrities are 
sensationalized by the news media. 

In addition, Sauter said that 30-
second TV commercials are the pri-
mary form of political communica-
tion today, but are inadequate to 
inform the public. 

"The grammar of politics today 
is in a very debased form, and the 
result is that we have a disillusioned 
public," Sauter said. 

Sauter looks to the "Information 
Superhighway" as a possible solu-
tion to voter disinterest. According 
to Sauter, the "Information Super-
highway" would also provide a bet-
ter environment for the exchange of 
ideas than the system of TV net-
works and newspapers existing to-
day. 

"It should be feasible to create 
forms of competition through this 
new medium," he said. 

The "Information Superhigh-
way" would also open up "unprec-
edented opportunities" for college 
graduates looking for careers, ac-
cording to Sauter. 

"The truth of the matter is that 
there is a tremendous need and de-
sire for young people coming out of 
college [to] have a basic understand-
ingofformsofcommunication, what 
they mean and how they interre-
late." Sauter said. 

CHIMPS: New 
technique becoming 
widely used 
Continued hom pac. 2 
approximate 2,000 chimpanzees in 
the United States as genetic equiva-
lents may require rcassesment. His-
torically, West African chimps have 
been most widely used species of 
chimpanzees used for biomedical . 
research. 

The technique that Moore, Morin 
and Woodruff made known is al-
ready being utilized by other re-
searchers around the world. "There 
has been a lot of interest in using the 
molecular markers that we used," 
Morin said . 

"Now groups all over the world 
are doing the type of research thaI, â¢ 
by chance. we were the first to do," 
Woodruff said.

Let's see, one time for seven

over Christmas. I was like 12. 
I got a video game for Christ-

I did for a week; a shower 
wasn't important to me.

PARK IT 
HERE 

Instead of roaming the parking lots, ride the bus. Instead of stalking an empty spot, sit back and relax. 

Enjoy yourself. Turn up your headset. Look at the scenery for a change. Talk. Cram for a test if you have to. 
Why drive yourself nuts when students can ride for only $39 a month. As many rides on buses and trolleys 

as you want. Stop hunting. Start riding. Because we all know it's a jungle out there. 

The Roule. To Know To Get Where You Wanl To Go 
Four San Diego Transit routes serve UCSD. Chances are, one 
will take you directly where you want to go. If not, an easy 
transfer connects you to bus and trolley routes going every-
where in the county. Urban Fare $] .50, Express Fare 
(Rts. 30 & SO) $1.75. 
Route 30. Express between Downto~n San Diego and USIU 
via Pacific Beach, La Jolla, Torrey Pines Road, UCSD, VA 
Hospital, University Towne Centre, Miramar Rd., Mira Mesa 
and Scripps Ranch. 
Route 34. Downtown San Diego to University Towne Centre 
via Lorna Portal, Mission Beach, Pa.cific Beach, La Jolla, La 
Jolla Shores, Scripps Institute, UCSD, VA Hospital, Scripps 
Hospital, UCSD Housing, La Jolla Village Square (34A only) 
and North University City Housing (34A only.) 
Route 41. Torrey Pines Golf Course to Fashion Valley via

University City, Clairernont, Mesa College and Linda Vista. 

Route SO. Express between Downtown San Diego and La Jolla 
Village Square via Clairemont, University City, University 
Towne Centre and VA Hospital. Note: Rt. SO does not serve 
the campus direct. It travels on La 10lla Village Drive.

grad students and spouses. Just bring your UCSD photo ID to 
the UCSD Transportation Alternative at 406 MAAC or call 
534-RIDE.

RIMAe: Why 
was it built in the 
first place? 
Continued from PICe 20 

Another question: Why aren 't wc 
paying all of our athletic coaches 
full-time? Shouldn't our $70 contri-
bution go to the place with the most 
need? Millions of dollars are float-
ing around for this enormous struc-
ture. Where was this money when 
we needed it most, to save activities 
that students really love? 

Additional questions of practical-
ity arise concerning RIMAe. The 
three available we ight rooms on 
campus are almost never crowded. 
Last weekend at the Spanos weight 
room, a maximum of to people fre-
quented the building during an en-
tire Saturday. Do we reall y need a 
12,OOO-square-foot weightroom? If 
our present facilitie s are good 
enough for the Ghargers, aren' t they 
good enough for us? 

If the justification for RIMAC is 
that it wi II improve student morale, 
I think the administration is dead 
wrong. The vote in 1989 for R1MAC 
barely passed, so student support 
wasn't exactly overwhelming. 

If you want to improve student 
morale at UCSD, bring back real 
TGIF's, real pit dances and real 
block parties. Give us a football team 
to rally around, or Division I sports. 
Don't expect to build a 33.5 million 
dollar smoke screen with our money 
and then have all the students danc-
ing in the streets. 

I suppose I'm being a bit harsh. I 
know I'll probably be one of the first 
in line to walk through RIMAC's 
hallowed doors. But that doesn ' t 
mean I'm going to blindly support 
it and that doesn't mean all the ques-
tions go away. 

After all, just when does this 
thing open anyway? 

w. SOCCER: 
Tritons and Warriors 
battle to a 1-1 tie 
Continued from pqe 15 

Westmont had a free kick on the 
right side, 40 yards from the goal. 

McManus caUed for an offside 
trap but as the Warriors' Jennifer 
Wills took the kick, the entire Tri-
ton defense was out of position. 

Wills sent the baH into the middle 
of the penalty box where four War-
riors found themselves all alone with 
the nearest Triton five yards behind 
them. UCSD goalkeeper Cari 
Schwartz had no chance, and Rachel 
Petersen fired it home to tie the oon-
test at one. 

Both overtimes followed the 
same script as regulation. While the 
Tritons were able to continue run-
ning the sidelines, a stingy Westmont 
defense was able to deny them con-
trol of the center of the field. 

With 50 seconds left in the last 
overtime, UCSD's Dawn Lee took 
the final corner kick oflhe game_ She 
fcd Muchowski, whole header sailed 
wide of the post. It was an appropri-
ate end to a frustrating day for the 
Tritons. 

"It's a dislppointing result," 
McManus said. Mit was a tough 
week, but this team is still not fully 
tit. Once we're in playoffs, we're 
going to have to he able to beat qual-
ity teams back-to-bact." 

"It '5 been I very draining week, .. 
junior Carrie Peer said. "We've had 
some big wins, but we never relaxed 
in Iny of the gamea. This team plays 
its hardest every game and we know 
we could have beaten them."

Tritons Make Trinity (TX) Look SilJiman, 2-0 
HITCHHIKER: UCSD 
improves record to 8-5 
after shutout of 
Division III Trinity 
By ..... K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

What's worse than a men 's soc-
cer team with only one goalie? A 
men 's soccer team with one goalie 

without a car. 
So phomore 
Geo r ge 
All is on , 
UCSD's lone 
start ing goal 
keeper, found 
himself be-
tween a very 
long walk 
and Head 
Coach Derek 
Armstrong 's 
short-temper 

about 45 minutes before the Tritons' 
2-0 triumph over vis iting Trinity 
University (rX) on Saturday. 

" I don't have a car so I usually 
get rides from my roommates," 
Allison said. "Nobody was around 
so I had to page [Assistant Coach] 
Teddy [przybylek] for a ride. I'm sit-
ti ng there checking the clock - 30 
minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes-
pretty soon it's 3:00 and I'm seri-
ously stressing." 

Fo rtunate ly fo r the Tritons, 
przybylek nabbed the AWOL net-
mi nder, but not before the Tigers 
gave a scare to UCSD's "celebrity 
goalie of the week," sophomore 
midfielder Brian Turner. 

YIIMIv ZOlotom/ GIwOiMl 

UCSD'. a .... n SonnlchHn pays the prtc:e for wlnnln, durin, the Triton.' 2.0 win over TrinIty. 
Only five minutes into the con-

test, Trinity 's Patrick Diven charged 
down the right side, lifting a high lob 
from about 30 feet out which headed 
directly toward the left corner of the 
goal, we ll over the Triton defenses' 
reach. A confused Turner looked 
more like a contort io nist than a 
keeper. twisting his 6'3" frame into 
more unique posi tions than a bell y 
dancer at a Hawaiian luau. He for-
got one thing, though, the ball. 

As luck would have it, Diven 's 
shot nailed the far post and scooted 
harmlessly away. Six minutes laler, 
Allison spelled the midfielder-
turned-goalie and the potent Triton 
offense went to work. 

Ken Fuj ii , Matt Chilton, Nate 
Hetherington and Eric Waldman all 
had shots on Tiger keeper Bi ll 
Sil liman, but none were able to con-
vert, at least not until the 23:25 mark. 

With Fujii showcasing his ball-

handling wizardry on a helpless 
Trinity defense at the upper-left cor-
ner of the goalie box, Chilton crept 
behind Tiger defender Mark Lara at 
the far post. [n a flash, Fujii crossed 
a perfect line-drive pass near the up-
per-right post to the Tritons' main-
scoring threat, and sure enough, 
Chilton's header angled just out of 
the reach of Silliman and into the 
right comer of the net to give UCSD 
a 1-0 advantage. 

"Fujii played an unreal ball," 
Chilton said. "He turned the whole 
defense and laid it up there perfectly. 
It was basically a tap-in for me. I had 
to stretch a bit, but I got there." 

ClIilton, who brilliantly directed 
the Triton 's national champion de-
fense lasl year, has since been relo-
cated to the midfield to add some 
much-needed scoring punch to an at-
times goal-shy San Diego unit. 
Armstrong's tactic has paid off in 
spades - Chilton has convened a 
team-leading eight goals. 

Waldman added an insurance 
goal at 69:58, valiantly taking on two 
Tiger defenders by himself at the 
lop-right of the goalie box. After 
Waldman shook one defender, leav-
ing him rolling on the ground, the 
midfielder found himself doing the 
lango wilh a chargins Silliman 10 
yards out. Silliman dove in an at-
tempi to snare the ball, but it slipped 
out of his grasp, and instead tried to 
take Waldman down with him. 
Keeping his wits about him , 
Waldman wavered, but adeptly re-
discovered his footing and planted 
an open-net blast straight down the 
pipe to round out the scoring. 

"It's tough being the only goalie, 
but you do what you have 10 do," 
Allison said. "Sometimes I hesitate 
to go out and get the ball hard. If I 
get cracked, then what are we going 
to do? But my confidence is going 
up. Everybody is clicking better 
through the back. There hasn 't been 
too many shots on me. There were a 
few today, but nothing too hard."

concerned 
with re-
mainingup-
right than 
anything 
else. Not 
only was the 
tangle with 
Westmont 
the Tritons' 
(7-0-2) third 

game in five days, but also their most 
physical battle of the year, which 
ended only after 30 minutes of over-
time failed to establish a winner. 

The Warriors gave UCSD exactly 
the game it expected: a hard-fought 
slugfest that bad more than a few 
ugly moments. Unfortunately for the 
Tritons, that 's exactly the kind of 
game at which they are weakest. 

The game was a back-and-forth 
contest from the start. Although nei-
ther the Warriors, nor tbe Tritons 
could establish finn control during 
the fint half, UCSD found itself in 
the right place at the right time 10 
minutes into the game. 

Warrior goalkeeper Debbie 
Trujillo came out to challenge a Tri-
ton attack but misplayed the ball and 
ended up sprawled on the ground. 
UCSD's Ete Johnson and Amanda 
Johnson were both on top of the ball 
but were unable to overcome a tough 
angle, and Amanda Johnson's shot 
scooted wide right. 

lt was the first of three cbances 
the Tritons would get with the keeper 
out of position. 

The missed opportunity was a 
fair indicator of how the game was 
going for UCSD. Either because of 
fatigue caused by the week's tough 
schedule or the continual pounding 
any Triton would lake if she touched 
the ball, UCSD was unable to estab-
lisb any kind of sustained rhythm. 

Westmont's speed bothered 
UCSD which usually relies on its 
forwards to race up the sidelines and 
center the ball. On Friday, however, 
the Warriors were able to take away 
most of those sideline runs and bottle 
the Tritons up in the middle. 

"They were a physical team and 
as fast as we were, which is some-
thing we're oot used to," Amanda 
Johnson said. 

Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus ordered a change in strat-
egy - UCSD would look to move 
the ball around the field and playa 
lot of two-touch ban. "We were get-

ting knocked off the ball when we 
tried to hold on to the ball or run with 
it," Amanda Johnson said. 

But the second half was not a 
marked improvement over the first. 
The Tritons were getting more side-
line opportunities, however, espe-
cially in the first five minutes after 
the intermission. Carin Pugh 
steamed down the right sideline and 
lofted a perfect cross that Trujillo 
came out to catch. 

The ball slipped through the 
Westmont keeper 's hands, however, 
and was bouncing into the net when 
Warrior Kristen Martinez appeared 
out of nowhere to head the sure-goal 
clear of the nel and out of danger. 

Ten minutes later, the Tritons 
again found themselves staring at a 
wide-open goal. This time Brandie 
Hayungs penetrated on the right side 
before popping the ball back out to 
teammate Diana Muchowski. 
Trujillo found herself in a dilemma 
and tried to play Muchowski, but 
somehow ended up on the ground 
instead. Mucbowski's shot was per-
fect, but again a Warrior defender 
materialized. This time it wss 
Brenda Stratton who deflected 
Muchowski's shot out of the goal. 

The Tritons finally scored with 
17 minutes to play in the game. 
Brenna Cox dribbled deep down the 
left sideline before knocking a left-

footed cross toward the goal. This 
time the play worked perfectly, as 
Pugh knifed into the center of the 
goalbox and nailed a shot on-the-fly 
into the left comer for a 1-0 lead. 

With five minutes to play, the fa-
tigue finally caught up with the Tri-
tons and a mental error led to the 
Warriors' tying score.

The UCSD Guardiaa 

V-BAI,L: UCSD 
endures two losses in 
rough weekend set 
Coft!InuecIhn .... 20 
strugIed to keep pKe with San Ber-
nardino offensively in a IS-8 lea, 
which put them OD the verge of their 
second straight defeat. The fourth 
and final game of the contest was 
won by San Bernardino, 1S-9, to 
close out the match by a three-
games-to-one soore. 

"We fought harder and played a 
lot better [than against Westmont]," 
Head Coach Doug Dannevik said. 
"The fire was there, we just didn't 
execute." 

UCSD's offense was paced by 
sophomore middle blocker Ouistine 
Chi who banged down 14 kills in the 
match to go along with her six 
blocks. Jenn Cross also played well 
from the middle blocking position, 
tallying 10 kills and a .364 hitting 
percentage. 

"[Chi] has really stood out the 
past couple matches," Dannevik 
said. Chi '5 stellar play in the middle 
highlights her own talent as well as 
the Tritons recent inability to get 
offense from the outside. 

"With [Crochet) out, some play-
ers are trying to do too much to make 
up for it," Dannevik said. 

"When we play Division II 
teams, it exposes some of our weak-
nesses," he added. "But I think that 
it's good for us to play Pivision II 
teams and find out what we need to 
work on, [rather] than to play Divi-
sion III teams and win easy." 

It was an NAIA opponent rather 
than a Division II foe that dealt the 
Tritons a Friday evening defeat at the 
Main Gym. Westmont College sub-
dued UCSD in four sets after drop-
ping the first game. 

In an opening set which closely 
resembled the first game against 
CSUSB, the Tritons and Warriors 
battled to a IS-IS deadlock late in 
the game. W'Jen senior standout

ContInued from pace 20 
sophomore Craig Watson. Watson 
weaved the ball between the defense 
down the entire length of the pool 
before slamming it past Triton goalie 
Joe Welsh. 

It looked as ifthe half wou Id end 
in a 2-2 juggernaut, but with just 12 
seconds remaining, Skillen came 
through once again. He froze Ant-
eater goalie Jeremy Storton in the 
water as he lobbed in a two-point 
goal. 

Harper called it, "An awesome 
shot at an awesome time." The score 
vaulted UCSD to almost insur-
mountable 4-2 advantage.

Julie Harvey made a big dig off a 
solidly hit ball, and Cross pounded 
down a quick set from Jennifer 
Schofield, UCSD was within a point 
of winning the game. 

Westmont rebounded to take a 
17-16 lead, and Biesheuvel saved the 
game for the Tritons with a nifty dink 
put-away which allowed UCSD to 
come back to win the game. A hus-
tling Madelyn Ripken chased a ball 
off the court and played it back to 
Harvey who bumped it over. The 
Tritons then stuffed a Warrior hitter 
to take the game, 19-17. 

The second game was dominated 
by Westmont early 00 as it sprinted 

The Tritons kept the pressure on 
during the third quarter when senior 
Michael Yallech finished off an im-
pressive passing display with a goal 
that put his team up by three. 

After spreading the Anteater de-
fense around with several quick 
passes, senior Gregory Salvinski 
dumped the ball into Yallech, who 
slammed it straight in from three 
meters out. 

But the Tritons were unable to 
maintain the threeÂ·goal margin. By 
the end of the third quarter, UCI sur-
prisingly closed in with a goal by 
freshman Ryan Bailey. Sophomore 
Ofer Horn then chopped UCSD's 
lead to merely a single goal with 
only 34 seconds into the fourth quar-
ter. 

The Anteaters got their equalizer, 
pulling out all the stops with 3:05

to a 12-S advantage before UCSD 
gained itsromposure to close within 
14-11. The Warriors fi.nished out the 
game, however, quickly grabbing a 
2-1 lead in the match with a IS-I 
thrashing of the Tritons in game 
three. 

Westmont once again jumped to 
the early lead in game four, taking a 
commanding 7-0 lead before UCSD 
knew what had happened. The War-
riors took the game ISÂ·S, to win the 
match.

worked; Dannevik said. "Our pass-
ing broke down, we didn't play very 
smart. It was just ugly." 

remaining. They completed their 
comeback by taking the lead with 
only 2:03 remaining in the gripping 
contest, after sophomore Omar Amr 
forcefully drilled home the gameÂ· 
winner. 

The game ended after a contro-
versial no<all by the referee with 22 
seconds to play.1be foul would have 
given the Tritona an opportunity to 
tie the game on a free shot. Harper 
said that, "even people with a marÂ· 
ginal understanding of the game 
knew it should have been a penalty 
shot. " 

Harper also said the Tritons' fail-
ure to capitalize with a one-player 
advantage was another key nason 
for the heartbreaking loss. ..It was 
not a good six-on-five game. We had 
one when we were up two goals, and 
we could've won it right there. A 
three goal lead would have clinched 
it," Harper said. 

Despite the fairly disappointing 
lou, the Triton players tried to fo-
CUI on their marked improvement 
"[We] played really weD, and we've 
improved a lot u a whole," said 
freshman p1ie Joe Welsh. 

"[Va] would have crushed III at 
the begiJming of the year," Harper 
said. "We played really hard, and

A Rimonstrous 
Mistake 

Looking for something just a 
bit puzzling? Need something to 
ponder about? Well, your thirst for 
curiosity might just be quenched 
in a short time now. 

Listen up, kiddies. A new 
building is nearing completion on 
campus that represents the biggest 
question mark in UCSD athletic 
history. And that ain't even the 
start of it. 

You can 't really call this 
mon trosity a blunder. No, 
building a library before realizing 
that it might include a few things 
called "books" is a blunder. Or 
engineering an engineering 
building with narrow doorways so 
that the equipment can' t fit inside. 
Now, that 's a blunder. 

And you can't really call this 
new building a complete waste of 
money, either. It 's not a bunch of 
old, rich men feeding off our 
rising fees so they can retire in 
Palm Springs, tossing down 
tequila shots with Sonny Bono 
every weekend. 

No, supposedly we all voted, 
and all paid - and are still paying 
- for this new, 33.5 milli~n 
dollar, gargantuan structure on the 
north side of campus that could 
house the greater metropolitan 
population of Phoenix, every 
member of the sensational pop-
group UB40 and still have room 
for a pre-1990's Roseanne Barr. 

So what is this concoction of 
glass and steel which provokes 
endless sighs of amazement and 
also endless questions? 

Well, RIMAC be thy name. 
No one really doubts the 

magnificence of the structure. 
With a giggillion square feet of 
space, RIMAC is as unique and 
amazing as the University Library. 
It boasts a 5,OOO-seat arena and 
several gyms. It even seems that 
RlMAC is soundly built. 

But the question remains: Why 
build the darn thing in the first 
place? 

And folks, no one has an answer. 
Ask someone in UCSD administra-
tion about RIMAC, and they ' re 
bound to answer you in jolly, Gomer 
Pyle fashion: "Golly! It sure looks 
mighty purty!" 

Questions just keep popping up. 
I know that money allocation is a 
tricky thing and that, most likely, 
much of the funding for RIMAC 
was slotted only for RIMAe. But 
why cut out one of the most popu-
lar activities at UCSD, physical edu-
cation? Why aren't we spending our 
$70-a-quarter fee on that?

Tritons Get Sucked Up 
By Anteaters, 6-5 
KILLER ANTS: UCSD starts out fast, but is unable to maintain its three-
goal advantage in the second half; falls to eighth-ranked UC Irvine 
By Derek Van Hoften 
Staff Writer 

Every member of the Tritons' 
water polo team would agree the 
club has improved markedly since

the begin-
ning of the 
season. But 
every mem-
ber of the 
team would 
also agree 
that im-
provement is 
small conso-
lation for a 
gut-wrench-
ing defeat. 

One e 
again, the Tritons played a solid 
game, but once again they came 
up just a bit short of victory. This 
time they fell victim to the eighth-
ranked Anteaters from UC Irvine, 
6-5, at Canyonview Pool on Sat-
urday afternoon. 

UCI opened the scoring early. 
when junior Matt Maunz banked 
the ball in just 38 seconds into the 
game. UCSD Head Coach Denny 
Harper had been concerned about 
tile fi rst goal. 

"I knew that the team that 

scored first [would be] in the driver's 
seat. I was very fearful [UCI] would 
score first," Harper said. 

The Tritons did not crumble to 
the pressure, however. 

They responded immediately af-
ter falling behind, scoring on a pen-
alty shot by senior James Skaalen 
just 15 seconds later, to knot the 
score at 1-1. 

Skaalen struck again in the first 
quarter, when he set up junior Steve 
Crass for a powerful shot from three 
meters out. His bullet richocheted in 
with 3:47 remaining, to put UCSD 
ahead 2-1. 

The second quarter was scoreless 
until 1:55 remained, when UCI 
equalized the game with a goal by

UCSD in

STRUGGLES: UCSD 
had its share of prob-
lems this weekend in 
losses to Westmont and 
CSU San Bernardino 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Co-Editor 

Despite its number-four national 
ranking in Division Ill, the UCSD 
women 's volleyball team (13-5) re-

alizes that it 
needs to be on 
top of its game 
when it faces 
off against 
squads from 
Division 11 and 
the NAIA. 

Unfortu-
nately for the 
Tritons, they 
were not play-
ing up to their 
usually high 

standards during their weekend 
showdowns against Westmont Col-
lege and CSU San Bernardino. And 
they suffered the consequences. 

In its Saturday evening match up 
with San Bernadino, UCSD at-
tempted to rebound from a poorly 
played defeat at the hands of 
Westmont College the previous 
evening. 

UCSD played without outside 
hitter Angelle Crochet for the sec-
ond game in a row. Crochet, who 
was sidelined with a pinched nerve 
in her neck which she suffered in an 
Oct. 5 game against Point Loma, is 
a pivotal part of the Tritons' offen-
sive attack. Junior outside hitter 
Kelly McGlothlin, and sophomores 
Bonnie Kelly and Mieke Biesheuvel 
are filling in until Crochet is healthy 
enough to return to the starting rota-
tion. 

Crochet's absence and a Division 
II opponent were too much for 
UCSD to overcome and it dropped 
the match in four games after open-
ing strongly. 

Game one was a hard-fought 15-
13 tally in favor of UCSD. CSUSB 
came out swinging in game two, 
however, and didn't let up until it had 
pounded out a 15-10 victory to tie 
the match at one game apiece. 

In the third set, the Tritons
