ELP Remembers the Tritons 
Revelle program helped raise money for charity with football 
By CHARUE TRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Football arrived at UCSD last Friday when 
the Revelle Emerging Leaders Program held an 
all-campus, co-ed flag football tournament at 
RIMAC Field . The free event, dubbed 
"Remember the Tritons," also featured a 
postgame concert by Lefty and a raffle draw-
ing. 

The flag football game was played by two 
teams, Blue and Gold . Members from 
Roosevelt and Muir colleges formed the Gold 
team and members of Revelle, Warren and 
Marshall colleges made up the Blue team. The 
final score of the game was a 12-7 victory for 
Gold. 

A loud and enthusiastic crowd cheered the 
teams. Also supporting the players from the 
sidelines were the UCSD cheerleaders and the 
Pep Band. 

"The ELPers have worked really hard to try 
to get a sense of pride in being a UCSD stu-
dent: said ELP team leader Kari Kibler. "And 
they thought the best way would be to have a 
football team." 

The event continued into the night as Lefty 
performed to the remaining crowd. 

Marshall sophomore Geoffrey Chiapella, 
who played multiple positions for the Blue 
team, said that he enjoyed th,e event. 

"I think it was a big success: Chiapella sa id. 
"I'm glad we had a good turnout. It was a real-
ly fun atmosphere." 

"Remember the Tritons" was realized 
through an ELP group process that tried to 
create an event that would benefit- UCSD. 
Revelle freshman Bishoy Said, co-chair of the 
event with Revelle freshman Kenney Moore, 
said the event was intended to "instill a little 
spirit into the campus, because it 's really not 
there." 

The two co-chairs worked with a group of 
20 freshmen and sophomores in the ELP to 
create the event. This year's event marks a 
departure from the carnival event that ELP 
puts on annually. 

"I think [ELP] did an outstanding job of' 
putting on something that is memorable for the 
campus together - not the usual carnival 
event, but something unique," said Revelle 
Assistant Dean Liora Kian Gutierrez. 

The event also benefited two charity organi-
zations, Mama 's Kitchen and Locks of Love. A 
can ned food drive was held for Mama 's 
Kitchen, and over 250 cans were donated. 
Locks of Love, .an organization that provides 
wigs for patients with hair loss, had a booth 
where students could donate locks of their hair.

Students at various schools have 
staged protests, whIch range from si t-
ins to outdoor picnic boycotts against 
corporalions that finance the expan-
sion of prisons-for-profit. Sodexho 
proll'sts have taken place on more 
than 50 of the SOD campuses where 
lhe company operates dining halls and 
food couns. 

Kevin Pranis, a boardmember and 
coordinator for the Pri son 
Moratorium Project, said that the 
actual protests against Sodexho start-
ed over a year ago with 10 schools 
protesting, in some form , on April 4. 
Of Ihose 10 original schools, four now 
use dining services other than 
Sodexho. 

In more recent events, protests at a 
number o f schools have increased the 
number of victories.· Somj: schools 
have broken their contracts with 
Sodexho early and others have called 
off talks with the company. 

"Clearly, the company has been 
forced to respond: Pranis said. He 
added that Sodexho has said it will sell 
its shares in the Corrections 
Corporation of Ameri ca, a private 
prison company, but that has yet to 
happen. 

The project origina lly targeted just 
the New York area, but that quickly 
~n larged to much of the United States 
and most recently to London and-

Doing Time for 
Misdemeanor Crimes 

If lawbreakers don't want to pay for their mistakes, 
they should not commit them in the first place 

By ANDREW JEFFERY 
Staff Writer 

On Tuesday, April 24, the Supreme 
Court upheld the strength of the Fourth 
Amendment by declaring that police 
may arrest individuals for minor traffic 
offenses or other misdemeanors, usually 
punished only by a fine. Affected infrac-
tions include unbuckled seat belts, jay-
walking and public littering. 

The issue was raised when Gail 
Atwater, an upstanding Texan mother, 
was arrested for riding in her truck while 
neither she nor her two small children 
wore safety belts. At issue is the power 
and authority of police offers enforcing 
laws and the individual righ ts of those 
breaking them. 

While even the court admitted that 
Atwater probably should not have been 
arrested for her minor infraction, justice 
David Souter declared that disallowing 
such police actions would "turn many 
ordinary arrests into occasions for con-
stitutional litigation." The Fourth 
Amendment is in place to allow police 
officers a framework to properly perform 
their duties, not to protect people who 
get arrested and don't like it. 

Let us take as an example our 
responsible, upstanding Atwater, who 
decided that it was not necessary to 
buckle up her 3 .. year-old son and 5-
year·old daughter. After her arrest, Atwa-
ter filed a lawsuit against the police offi-
cer that arrested her, the city and the 
police chief, alleging they had violated 
her constitutional rights. - . 

It has become clear that breaking the 
law is not something to be taken seri-
ously, and that laws are simply in place 
to provide opportunities for frivolous 
lawsuits. We have a case of an irrespon-
sible mother not looking after her chil-

dren - even putting her children's lives 
in danger - and now she is the victim? . 

I must admit that the public outcry 
over this decision in favor of Atwater 
does not surprise me. The American 
Civil Liberties Union publicly 
announced that "the Court has turned 
back the clock on three decades of civil 
rights enforcement." The current popu-
lar Iibefal consensus (what we are sup-
posed to think) tells us that regardless of 
our actions, our civil liberties and rights 
must be upheld at all costs. In the end, 
what matters most is not justice, and it is 
certainly not the safety of those around 
us. Instead, the most self-serving and 
outright selfish route must be chosen. 
The well-being of Atwater's children has 
been all but ignored as the rights of an 
irresponsible, law-breaking mother have 
taken center stage. 

Unfortunately, this type of incident 
is all too common, and it is high time 
the Court took action to prevent such 
lawsuits, as a seemingly obvious issue 
has been left out of the discussion: 
lawlessness. 

Laws are put in place by govern-
ments to protect its citizens and their 
personal property. Traffic laws such as 
seat belt requirements, jaywalking and 
other seemingly insignificant laws are 
in place to protect, not to inhibit. If the 
breaking of these laws is ignored, what 
then is the point of having the law in 
the first place? Just as police officers do 
not have the right to discriminate when 
making arrests, we as citizens do not 
have the right to pick and choose 
which infractions we get caught for. 
When we break laws, we voluntari(y 
place ourselves at the mercy of the law 
enforcement authorities.

The Supreme Court's decision was much too harsh 
and can lead to abuse of power by the pol·ice 

By LAUREN POPP 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Imagine the last time you were pulled 
over. Maybe you were running to get 
that rental video in before midnight and 
neglected to buckle up for the five-
minute commute. The officer is unfor-
giving, and after making you wait those 
agonizing minutes while he runs your 
license, finally returns only to send you 
off with the dreaded yellow slip that will 
surely be the final blow to your bank 
account. You use a few colorful phrases 
as you cower off, embarrassed and angry, 
but relieved to at least be through with 
the ordeal. 

But what if it hadn't ended there? 
What if, instead of a yellow slip, the offi-
cer offered you a pair of shiny cuffs and 
a ride to the station where you wait in a 
cell while he performs a thorough search 
of your car? Does that seem a bit unrea-
sonable? 

The decision handed down April 24 
by the Supreme Court makes this irra-
tional and unconstitutional procedure 
legal in cases of misdemeanors punish-
able by fines, like not wearing a seat belt 
or littering. 

Driving her two children home from 
soccer practice, Gail Atwater experi-
enced the above scenario firsthand three 
years ago and so prompted the suit 
against the Lago Vista police department 
in Texas that led to last Tuesday's deci-
sion. The arrest was in clear violation of 
Atwater's Fourth Amendment rights 
against unreasonable search and seizure. 
Not only was she subjected to the 
humiliation of being ordered to jail but 
also the officer involved felt it necessary 
to search her truck (in which he found 
such incriminating items as tricycles and 
children's shoes) and then leave the 

vehicle there to be towed . 
The Supreme Court's rejection of 

Atwater's claim essentially removes our 
Fourth Amendment rights as citizens. 
Should you be pulled over and accused 
of a minor traffic violation, you are guilty 
in the same instant and can lawfully be 
taken to jail. No lawyer, judge or juries 
are allowed here - your fate is left to the 
officer involved. 

"Such unbound discretion carries 
with it grave potential for abuse," said 
justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the dis-
senting side. Indeed, with this ruling, 
police officers are granted a dangerous 
new freedom that could easily be taken 
advantage of. Citizens are suddenly 
stripped of their legal protection from 
any officer who exhibits poor judgment. 

What is most frightening is the 
inh~rent possibility for discrimination 
and prejudice, as officers can essentially 
harass citizens on a whim and with little 
provocation. "As the recent debate over 
racial profiling demonstrates all too 
clearly, a relatively minor traffic infrac-
tion may serve as an excuse for stopping 
and harassing an individual';" O'Connor 
explained. 

Cases of racial profiling are all too 
common among police departments 
across the .country from Santa Fe to 
Cincinnati to New York, where a recent 
poll revealed that 6S percent of the pop-
ulation believes that racial profiling is a 
significant problem within the NYPD. 
This ruling will simply compound such 
a problem by making this kind of dis-
crimination possible to a further extent. 

justice David H. Souter of the 
majority opinion dismissed such con-
cerns of racial discrimination by sug-
gesting that the law will be carefully

Trying Hard Convinces No One 
Jaded & 

Faded 
People try too hard to be indi-

viduals these days. Obviously, no 
two people on this planet are 
alike. There is nothing wrong 
with being true to oneself. There 
is something wrong when one 
goes to great lengths to demon-
strate it to the rest of the world . 

When I saw her going to extreme 
lengths to rebel - involved in an 
argument over a trivial matter 
concerning $5 - I realized that 
she was trying toO hard 10 con-
stantly go against the grain . And I 
am of the belief that people who 
try 100 hard are only trying to 
prove something to themselves. 

Bush's First 100 
Were Positive 

CAROLINE SONG 

President Bush's first 100 days 
prove critics '0Irong 

L ast Friday, I took a non-UCSD friend of mine to a party on campus. It was 
a rare occurrence (the on-campus 
party, not the friend), but it did 
take place. As I pointed out the 
people I knew and made various 
comments, my eyes settled on one 
particular person. I had seen her 
around several times throughout 

. the year. 1 had even found myself 
in proximity to her a few times. I 
had witnessed an argument she 
had with another student over a 
trivial matter. All of these occur-
rences led me to one conclusion: 
The girl really annoys me. 

Now before you start bringing 
up the subject of the last article 1 
wrote, about how girls are bitches, 
and before you start pointing fin-
gers, let me explain why this per-
son annoys me. She wears "funky" 
clothes. She dyes her hair a very 
unnatural shade. She sports a nose 
ring (and she's not Indian). She is 
in the habit of rebelli ng against 
whatever system is at hand. On 
this particular night, she was danc-
ing with some friends, flailing her 
arms wildly about, giving off an air ' 
that practically screamed, "1 will 
not be conventional! I am unique! 
I am an individual, hear me roar-
no wait, too many people use that 
expression. I must come up with 
something different!" 

You know what I'm talking 
about. That guy, the one in your 
class who always raises his hand 
to make a counterpoint to what-
ever the professor has just said -
what do you call him? Smart ass. 
He could talk to the professor 
after class, or go to office hours to 
discuss his opinion with the pro-
fessor instead of wasting class 
time. So why doesn't he? Because 
he wants to show off. OK, so 
maybe he is smart, but does any-
one appreciate his intelligence? 

How about that geeky guy you 
knew in high school, the one who 
came home the summer after 
freshman year in college with a 
goatee? In high school , he was 
considered a nerd, and now that 
he's a "man ", off to college, he 
can't return home without show-
ing some sign of change or matu-
rity. The most opvious way to do 
this? Grow some facial hair. 

It's the same idea with Rebel 
Girl and people like her. In the 
same way that Smart-Ass Guy and 
Goatee Guy don't convince you of 
their intellect and maturity, respec-
tively, Rebel Girl doesn't convince 
me of her self-assurance. It 's not 
really about the clothes, the hair or 
the way she looks. (l guess some 
people genuinely think it's attrac-
tive to have obviously dyed hair.) 

It's more about the attitude. 

Anyone who is truly sure of 
himself does not feel the need to 
prove it to others. If Smart-Ass 
Guy were rea lly secure in his 
intelligence, he would not need 
to broadcast it to the entire class. 
If Goatee Guy had really matured 
during his first year of college, he 
would realize that altering his 
physical appearance to impress 
people is actually very immature. 

While I'm sure that Rebel Girl 
is unique in her own weird way, 
she does a very poor job of prov-
ing her sincerity. Rebellion serves 
its purpose when directed against 
oppression and injustice. It 
becomes, however, paltry and 
pathetic when one uses it indis-
crili'ii nately to prove a point. 

The bottom line is that people 
who try too hard don't convince 
anyone - anyone intelligent, at 
least. While some peopk really 
are true to themselves by looking 
different or going against the 
grain, it's really easy to tell which 
ones are genuine and which ones 
are just insecure and searching 
for .an identity or a way to assert 
themselves. 

So as far as l'm concerned, 
ReDel Girl can pierce five morc 
body parts or dye her hair a mult i-
tude of colors. I'm still not con-
vinced that she is anything special.

It has been tradition sino: the 
presidency of Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt to grade nell' presiden-

have accomplished in thdr first 
100 days in office. The media and 
the rest of the nation decided to 
follow that tradition , and for the 
most part, have given our 43rd

George W. Bush's approval ratings 
have gone up, and deservedly so, 
since he took the oath of office 
back in January.

6 OP[ [ON The UCSD Guardian 

Nexus is Placed in a Bind 
Student slate at Marshall was unfairly treated 
By ANDREW FU 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

2001 has not been a good year 
for UCSD elections. 

One of the low points occurred 
on April 10, when the student 
counCIl "election" at Marshall col-
lege turned into a disgrace. Due to 
disqualification, students were left 
with only one candidate to choose 
from for each of the eight posi-
tions. 

Nexus, onc out of rwo slates 
running in the election, was dim-
inated due to numerous viola-
tions, including posting too many 
signs and "dorm storming" (going 
into residence halls to solicit 
votes) . As a result, the other slarc, 
Marshall Posse, automatically won 
all right positions. 

As your average Marshall frsh-
man, at first the whole ordeal just 
seemed kind of bothersome to 
me. I was troubled that I didn't get 
to choose, but who gives a crap 
about Nexus or Marshall Posse? 
Someone's just going to come in 
and go through the motions. 

However, the more I looked 
into the issue, the more it alarmed 
me. And the more I looked at 

I'\~xus. the more I understood the 
positive messages it has for 
UCSD. 

The idea of such a lopsided 
ckction at Marsftall college is par-
ticularly upsetting and ironic, 
because the school was estab-
lished in 1970 as a college for stu-
dents who questioned the mes-
sages that society srnds, and as an 
institution that advocated social 
change. 

Whether Marshall college lives 
up to Its role of polttical activist is 

in the eye of the beholder. Nexus, 
however, fits this bill perfectly. 

It was just a group of students 
that wanted to make a difference, 
to make our time in college more 
enjoyable - and above all, to get 
more students involved in the 
decision-making process that 
affects us all. 

After meeting with student 
council chair candidate Adam 
Sherry, vice chair candidate Brent 

ibecker and director of finance 
candidate Mike Afshar. their good 
intentions for Marshall college 
became apparent, as did the full 
extent of the mistake made in 
eliminating them. 

Its members put their 
voices out there and 
tried to make some 
changes, but they were 
denied any chance to 
help the student body. 

"The main thing we based this 
campaign on was the fact that 
people around us weren't happy," 
Sherry said. "This school has so 
much potential that is not real-
ized." 

The problem is. students are 
not talking loudly enough . How is 
the schoo l supposed to know 
what we want or need? There's 
S.C.O.R.E., a weekly meeting 
where students can voice com-
plaints. But it is not always the 
current situation that needs to be 
remedied ; there are new things 
that can be done to improve our 

way of life. 
Nexus proposed a solution to 

the problem of miscommunica-
tion: Get more students involved 
in council meetings. 

"If we're spending a few thou-
sand dollars, I want more than 20 
kids to be involved in it: Afshar 
said. 

Nexus' answer is simple and 
sound. Hold public forums, which 
students will know about ahead of 
time, in which student concerns 
can be addressed. This isn't the 
same as S.C.O.R.E. - it's getting 
students involved in what the stu-
dent council does. The parliamen-
tary procedure and boring stuff 
will be left fo r more official coun-
cil meetings. Perhaps people 
might not have shown up anyway, 
but maybe they would have, and 
Nexus wou ld have given students 
a chance to be heard. 

Nexus was punished essentia l-
ly for wanting just tha t - to ~ 
heard. Sure, maybe it posted more 
flyers than were allowed, but is 
that really such a big deal? Its 
members put their voices out 
there and tried to make some 
changes, but they were denied any 
chance to help the student body. 

The circumstances in which 
Nexus was booted are suspicious. 
In addition, members of Nexus 
complain that their punishment 
- which included 15 hours of 
community service and an ethics 
class - was too harsh . 

First, Marshall Posse was faced 
with many of the same charges as 
Nexus, yet went unpunished. 
Regardless of the parties' guilt, the 
manner in which the election

Bush: 
First 100 days is proof 
president will suceed 
Continued from paC. 5 
of gridlock and partisan wrangling, 
it is a place where solutions are 
fo und. 

Quite soon, the president will 
be able to sign an economic stim-
ulus package in which the Ameri-
can taxpayer will receive a $1.35 
trillion tax cut over the next 11 
years. With the support of many 
moderate Democrats, the adminis-
tration will be ab le to push 
through the promised tax cut. 

Admittedly, $1.35 tri llion is not 
as much as the $1.6 tri ll ion that 
the president initially proposed; 
however, one can hardly expect to 
get everything one wants in the 
world of poli tics. The $1.35 tril-
lion, of course, is much more than ' 
the $600 billion that congressional 
Democrats proposed late last year. 
It is easy to see why the president 
can claim victory for the tax reduc-
tions that the American people will 
receive. 

During campaign 2000, Demo-
cratic presidentia l candidate AI 
Gore contended that a Bush tax cut 
would be risky for the country 
because it would cause our spend-
ing deficits and our national debt 
to rise. A tax cut would leave less 
revenue in the government's cof-
fers, he argued. 

The president once again 
proved his opponents wrong. By 
reducing the rate of growth on the 
government's spending from a 
gargantuan 8 percent a year to a 
lower and more acceptable rate of 
4.9 percent, we as a nation wi ll be 
able to enjoy the benefits of a tax 
cut and not have to suffer greater 
increases in our deficit. Bush 
proved his leadership in this area 
by also bringing moderate 
Democrats to the negotiating

table so that a bipartisan agree-
ment could be reached. The 
agreement leaves all Americans 
better off than when they were 
overtaxed and their government 
was spending too much. 

In addition to the tax cut, Con-
gress is working on the president's 
education reform package. Much 
like how the president negotiated 
his tax package, he is asking for 
help from members on the other 
side of the aisle, namely Massachu-
setts Sen. Edward Kennedy. The 
legislation that will soon arrive on 
the president's desk will include 
national testing for all students and 
flexibility for local districts as to 
how they spend _their money. Both 
the testing and flexibility measures 
were proposed during the cam-
paign by then- Gov. Bush and will 
soon become the law of the land. 
Both measures will allow for this 
great nation to leave "no child 
behind" and will allow for the 
American dream to become a real-
ity fo r so many more students 
across this country. 

T hese fi rst 100 days of Bush 's 
admin istration have been a stun-
ning success. We as a nation , 
under the president'S leadership, 
have gained in prestige around the 
world. In addit ion, a new day has 
arrived in our nation's capi tal. 
This Repub lican president has 
shown that he can and he will 
work with Democratic leaders to 
find common ground so that our 
nation will be better off. We are 
well tmderway in getting out from 
under the overbearing taxes that 
are assessed to all Americans. We 
are also well underway in giving 
our teachers, parents, and educa-
tors the tools they need to make 
our classrooms places of learning 
once again. 

All of this has occurred in a 
mere 100 days of the Bush pres i-
dency. It will be a wonder to see 
what is to come in the remaining 
1,360 days.

Souter is completely naive to 
be lieve that local officials will be 
capable of preventing this type of 
abuse under such an ambiguous 
law. particularly because the 
majority of the cases of racial pro-
filing go unreported. 

From a practical perspective, 
the use of arrests for such minor 
offenses is simply unnecessary. 
The additional costs to the state, 
and therefore, to us as citizens, 
will no doubt be excessive; and for 
what? So that soccer moms like 
Atwater can learn a lesson? I 
agree that she was very irrespon-
sible for not buckling up her chil-

obey the law.

they have learned from their moth-
er's si tuation, it seems likely that 
Atwater's children would respond, 
"Mommy broke the rules. so she 
whined . And lots of people thmk it 
doesn't matter that she broke the 
rules, just that she whines a lot." I 
don't see this as a very positive 
example to set for children. 

Many of us were taught long ago 
that if you break the rules, you will 
get in trouble. Today, I see that th is 
simple cause-and-effect relation-

ging her from her crying children 
and spending my tax dollars to 
book her downtown. 

I expect my police department 
to "protect and defend" others and 
myself by removing dangerous 
persons from society - is that not 
the in tent ion of an arrest? If a 
crime has been determined to be 
punishable by a fine, let that be the 
only punishment. I know it's deter-
rent enough for me. 

Furthermore, the category of 
fine-only misdemeanors spans a 
huge range of crimes, most of 
which do not necessitate the 
immediate removal of the "crimi-
nal." While I fully support fining 
those who disregard the environ-
ment by tossing their trash wherev-
er they please, I do not feel that a 
litterbug poses such a .threat that 
they must be swept from the 
premises and immediately carted 
off to a jail cell. 

Without a doubt there are cases 
where it is legitimately necessary

Clearly the more logical solu-

more concretely when an arrest is

is sufficient. Justice Soutcr refused

LJ nJled St,lles to show restraint.

while leaving countries like Algeria 
and Libya as elected members. 

Well before Bush 's arrival in 
office, however, France began 
referring to the United States as a 
"hyperpowcr." 

Other countrics, from Russia 
to China, have also made much of 
the nCl'd for "counterbalances" to 
U.S. power. In tillS sense, any I11IS-
steps by the Republican adminis-
tration havc providcd ammunition 
for .1 gun already p,lrtly loaded . 

But Bush 's apparcllt II1scnsitil'l-
ty to European concerns on a 
broad range of issues has clearly 
openl'd thc \\'ay for a season of 

TMS Pho 

America-bashing. Celebrating the 
record number of votes - 52 out of 
a possible 53 - won by France in 
the election that ousted the United 
States, Jean-David Levine, the 
French ambassador to the United 
Nations, attributed his country's 
success to a French foreign policy 
"founded on dialogue and respecl." 

The message was clear: The 
embarrassing snub to the United 
States could be attributed to a 
seeming abse nce of "dialogue and 
respect" in the Bush administra-
tion's approach to the outside 
world.

Space: 
Tito was world's first 
paying space tourist 
Continued from pag_ 1 
Russian astronauts were pulled 
from their capsule, "It was paradise. 
I just came back from paradise." 
News reports said the capsule, char-
broiled after its re-entry, took a 
scuffing as its parachute dragged it 
50 feet at the touchdown point near 
Arkalyk, 250 miles southwest of the 
Kazakh capital, Astana. 

"It was a great flight, great land-
ing, a soft landing," Tito said, grin-
ning and waving as he momentari -
ly tried to stand and then sank will-
ingly into a chair that bore him to a 
nearby mobile hospital for a check-
up. His more seasoned space com-
panions, Talgat Musabayev, the 
flight co mmander, and Yuri 
Baturin, the flight engineer, walked. 

After.vard, all three fl ew by heli-
copter to Astana. There, Tito and 
his colleagues were greeted by 
Kazakhstan 's president, ursultan 
Nazarbayev. Then the Russian crew 
and Tito flew back to Moscow, 

Hospital: 
Number of pubLic 
hospitals has dwindLed 
Continued from page 1 
serving the lInderserved, stayed on. 

But the hospital has also been 
sorely mismanaged, and it has bled 
red ink to the point of bank.ruptcy. 

That led the federal co ntrol 
board that oversees the city's finan-
cial affairs to contract with a consor-
tium of private health care providers 
to take over the hospital and its six 
clinics. 

"We are tossing public health 
into the trash," said Dr. Michal 
Young, a neonatologist and presi-
dent of the hospital'S medical and 
dental staff. "When you lose public 
health in the capital of the most 
pOlVerful nation in the world, it is an 
indicator of whal the rest of the 
country is going to do." . 

Over the last two decades, as 
competition has forced hospital 
mcrgers and acquisitions, the num-
ber of public hospitals in the United 
States has dwindled. In 1999, the last 
year for which figures arc available, 
that number was 1,197, down from 
1,778 in 1980, according to the 
American Hospital Association . By 
comparison, private hospitals 
dropped to 3,759 from 4,052. 

"In cities and in rural areas, hos-
pit..1ls have an increasingly difficult 
time making it, and public hospi-
tals are often the most vulnerable 
institutions." said Larry S. Gage, 
president of the National 
Association of Public Hospitals 

The end of Tito's eight-day 
adventure, which took him to the 
International Space Station, did not 
end the public dispute between the 
Russian and American space agen-
cies over space tourism. Though the 
two agencies reached a last-minute 
agreement on the terms for Tito 's 
ride, recriminations have followed. 

The NASA administrator, 
Daniel S. Goldin, has promised to 
present the Russian space agency 
with a bill for the hours of work 
required by extra precautions and 
the "incredible stress" placed on 
NASA employees as they tried 10 
ensure that Tito would not break 
anything or otherwise endanger the 
space station , 

The chief designer of the 
Russian portion of the space sta-
tion, Yuri Semyonov, who is also 
chief of the Russian rocket builder, 
the Energiya corporation, said 
Sunday that Goldin's objections 
and ASA's attempt to bar Tito 
from the American section of the 
space station amounted to erecting 
an "iron curtain" in space.

and Health Systems, 
Many mourn the loss of the 

institutions that have historically 
been the nation's health care 
providers of last resort . 

"These are a treasure and we 
shouldn't let them go," said Sandra 
Opdyckc, author of "No Onc Was 
Turned Away" (Oxford University 
Press, 1999), ab ut the New York 
City public hospital system. 

At its peak, afte r World War II , 
D.C. General had cnough patients 
to fill 1,600 beds. Last Monday, the 
patient COWlt was 11 9, a rene tion 
of staffing cuts, uncertainty about 
the hospital's future and the reality, 
faced by all hospitals, that patients 
today are sent home sooner and 
often not admitted at all. 

The private consortium that is 
taking over D.C. General is led by 
Greater Southeast Community 
Hospital, which has promised to 
increase medical services for unin-
sured patients by 34 p~rcent, and 
for $30 million less each yea r than 
taxpayers contributed to run D.C. 
General last year. 

But many residents remain 
uneasy about whether Greater 
Southeast can live up to that com-
mitment. 

"Hospi tals are not interchange-
able parts in some health care 
machine," said Alan Sager, a pro-
fessor of public health at Boston 
University who consulted with the 
unions at D.C. General in an effolt 
to keep the hospital open , "It takes 
a while to reweave a con nection."

"We really wanted the film to get

Audit Finds Gender Disparities 
in UC System Hiring Practices 

Dodge Asks Regents 
to Stay With WRC 

Only 29 percent of newly hired professors are women 
LOS ANGELES The despite continuous attempts to 

attract female faculty. 
the report recommcnds furthcr 
monitoring male-female salary 
ratios. 

Regents consider change to 
anti-sweatshop Code of Conduct 

University of California hires 
female faculty at lower rates than 
the available labor pool, leading to 
a gender disparity among 
professors. 

A state audit conducted over a 
five-year period and released 
Wed nesday found 'that while 46 
percent of the applicants available 
for hire nationwide are women, 
only 29 percent are actually hired 
to be professors at the Uc. 
- Part of the reason for this dis-

• parity lies in the fact that depart-
ments tend to hire more estab-
lished, senior facu lty rather than 
assistant professors - and these 
tend to be men . 

Also, opening up applica tions 
to international candidates, as well 
as focusing faculty searches on 
male-dominated fields like engi-
llecring -and physical sciences, sig-
nificantly reduce the nUl'1ber of 

- womcn in the applicant pool, 
. according to the study. Thus, the 
actual pool fr06J1 which the UC 
hires professors is only 33 percent 
female. "The audi t showed no 
direct discrimination, but we 
should attempt to improve as 
much as possible," said Abby 
Lunardini , spokeswoman for the 
UC Office of the President. 

"The pool we hire from cuts 
out people who get their Ph ,D, 
from a lower-level institution and 
have no outside research experi-
ence: she said, adding that this is 
something the UC definitely 
wants to change. 

Manha West, a law professor at 
UC Davis, sa id the UC "plays a 
game of 'let's steal your super-
stars '" instead of hiring younger 
assistant professors. 

Gender disparity is especially 
significant in the physical sci-
ences. In the engineering school at 
UCLA, for example, about 10 out 
of the 140 pr~fessors are. women. 

]. Woody Ju, chai r of civil and 
environmental engineeri ng, said 
only one of the 15 professors in 
his department is a woman , 

~The relative pool of outstand-
ing doctoral candidates are male, 
In my department, there are 
roughly 60 Ph.D. students and 
only three are female ," he said. 
"But the same is not true at the 
undergraduate level, where in the 
civil engineering almost half of the 
students are female." 

Because of a recent Supreme 
Court ruling that narrowed the 
applicabi lity of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act , it will be more difficult 
for women , or minorities, to sue 
for discrimination - unless it was 
done intentionally. 

The audit also found 
that departmentaL search 
committees are 
overwhelmingly male -
in fact, the search 
committees for nearly 
two-thirds of the 242 
newly hired professors 
the audit tracked included 
no women at all, 

" ow, if 80 to 90 percent of 
our faculty are white men, we 
can't use that to prove discrimina-
tion exists." said Student Regent 
Justin Fong, who added that he 
sees definite discrimination in the 
faculty hiring process. 

The audit , requested by sta te 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, 
also looked at the staning salaries 
for female faculty, and found that, 
on average, women receive 90 to 
92 percent of the pay male profes-
sors receive when they are first 
hired. Some of this disparity, how-
ever, has more to do with women's 
concentration in lower-paying 
fields and does not necessari ly 
mean women are paid less for 
doing the same job. Nevertheless, 

The audit also found tlwt 
departmental search commi ttees 
are overwhelmingly male - in 
fact , the search committees for 
nearly two-thirds of the 242 
newly hired professors the audit 
tracked included no women at 
all. 

According to the Bureau of 
State Audits, a decline in the pro-
portion of newly hired female fac-
ulty was the reason bchind the 
repon - especially in light of 
Tidal Wave II , which will 1l0t only 
increase the numbcr of students 
in the UC by 60,000 over the next 
decade, but also prompt Ihe hir-
ing of about 7,000 new faculty. 
Currently, the UC employs aboul 
8,000 professors. 

"Is Ihere a stra tegy to dcal wi th 
the increase in faculty?" asked Jim 
Turner, assistant vice challcellor 
of graduate division . 

The UC has 60 days to 
respond to the report's rccom-
mendations, which include avoid-
ing all-mak search committces 
and considering additional out-
reach to identity wider applicant 
pools, But because of Proposition 
209, the 1996 state initiative that 
banned the consideration of gen-
der and race in university hiring 
and admissions, the UC cannot 
actively recruit female faculty, or 
decide who to hire based 011 the 
person's gender. 

According to Fong, new crite-
ria the university has implement-
ed to address the drop in under-
represented minority admits -
such as looking at geographiC or 
socioeconomic background -
does not address the gender dis-
parity in faculty hiring. 

"A lot of attention has been 
paid to admissions and minori-
ties," Fong said . "The issue of gen-
der isn't something that has been 
spoken of."

A.s. Presidl'nt Jdf Dodgl' sub-
mitted a resoilition to the A.S. 
Council recommending that tht' 
UC Board of Regents d(les not 
drop its membership with thc 
Worker Rights Consortiulll. 

The UC Board of Regl'llts has 
set up a subcoillmittel' to rl'-evalu-
ate the uniwrsity's membership in 
the Worker Rights Consortium, thl' 
watchdog organization that moni-
tors the Uniwrsity of C.lliforni,I's 
adhercnCl: to the codl' of contill(t, 
which states that university JppalTI 
is not to bl' madl' in swe,lIshops.

to thl: Fair Labor Associ ,lllon,

CSD 's A.s. Coullcil hds bl'l'll 
presented with a rl'solutlon ,ilrt'ildy 
pass cd by councils at UCLA ilnd 
UC Bcrkeky. 

The rcsolution statcs th,ll 
"Studcnts hal',' remained extrl'l1ll'-
Iy critical of the Fair L.lb r 
Association, anolher opanization 
vying to monitor UC's Codl: of 
Conduct, whosl' Executivc Board 
includes apparel COl11pallleS, 
including Nikc and Adidas, as well 
as nongovernmcntal organiza-
tions." 

UCS D student Jessica Wedge 
brought UCLA and UC Berkeley's 
passing of this rcsolution to 
Dodge's attention. 

Tht' council's rl'solution will be 
decided Wednesday. 

The WRC has beell used to 
monitor the code of conduct SllKe 
it was established, after the Unlll:d 
Swdents Againsl Labor movemmt. 

Dodge docs not ft'el thai the 
FLA wou ld successfully do what it 
claims, because of its "big busilll:SS 
interests." 

"We want to stay with an orga-
nization that does not promote thl' 
righ ts of corporate entities; we 
want to stay with a group that pro-
motes human rights and fair work-
ing conditions in other countries,"

Trekking through the Amazon, I was taught 
by indigenous peoples to follow insects in 
search of nourishment. What I learned in 
the jungle has stayed with me to this day. 
Walking through campus, hot on the trail 
of a good meal, I found a variety of critters 
anxiously awaiting the exit of each 
customer at a particular cafe, hoping for 
just one small drip of Chai or a single 
crumb from a heavenly cinnamon roll ... 

As the ocean breeze flows to the east, find 
your way to Earl's Place, the best late night 
and weekend eats this side of the equator,

12 The UCSD Guardian 

Welcome to the Fourteenth Annual 
UCSD Undergraduate Research Conference. 

The purpose of UCSD's Annual Research Conference is to recognize the outstanding 
scholarly work produced by our undergraduates and to stimulate additional interaction 
between students and faculty at the research level. Another goal is to encourage more 
undergraduates to pursue doctoral degrees and careers in research and college teaching. 

A total of 93 students will be presenting papers at the conference this year. All participants 
have been nominated by a member of the faculty who has judged their work to be out-
standing . All students will be awarded a certificate as a research scholar. 

The conference is organized into 16 small roundtable discussions. At each roundtable, 
five to seven students will present their papers with one or more faculty members serving as 
moderators. Each student has 15 minutes to discuss his or her paper and 5 minutes to 
answer questions. After all presentations are completed, there will be additional time for 
group discussion. Students will present their papers at either a moming or aftemoon round-
table. During the session when they are not presenting, students will attend a roundtable of 
their choice as a member of the audience. 

This conference was made possible by generous support from the Vice Chancellor of 
- Student Affairs, Joseph Watson , and the Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs , Marsha 

Chandler. The annual UCSD Undergraduate Research Conference is planned and coordi-
nated by Academic Enrichment Programs which is part of Student Educational 
Advancement.

is hosting a fashion show 
a local charity 

Senior Staff Writer 

Monday, May 7, 2001 

xpress to Success, a Revelle-
based organization, was cre-
ated last year to hldp students 
improve their in terpersonal 
and public speaking skills. 

However, this group is doing more 
than giving students confide nce and 
public poise. 

This week , ETS will host its second 
annual charity fashion show competi-
tion, "Remember the Time ... '80s 
Flashback," to help a San Diego-based 
charity known as Becky's House. 

Becky's House provides shdtcr for 
women and children who arc victims 
of domestic abuse. The YWCA, which 
coordinated the project, also offers 
supportive services such as psycholog-
ical and educational counsding, child 
care and job training. -

Crucial to the developillent of the 
program were its founders, DJs Jeff & 
jcr from STAR 100.7 FM. When a 
woman, fictitiously named Becky, 
called the jeff & jer morning ra9io 
show years ago. the idea for Becky's 
House emerged. 

After it became apparen t that the 
ca ller was suffering from domestic 
abuse, STAR listeners donated over 
$40,000 to help "Becky" and her 4-
year-old son . 

What fo llowed was a partnership 
between jeff & Jer, STAR 100.7, the 
YWCA and City Council woman 
Barbara Warden tha t has made Becky's 
House a reality. jeff & jer remai n 
ardent supporters of the program, 
while Coun cilwoman Warden has led 
the way in ,procuring funding for 
building a 10-unit transition house. 
The San Diego YWCA is operating 
the program for the ci ty. 

Stage and lighting director Ping 
Huang emphasized how both ETS 
and Becky's House benefit from the 
event. 

"Obviously I would like to see the 
fashion show generate a lot of support 
and publicity for Becky's House," 
Huang said . "But just as important is 
that our ETS students ga in something 
from it as well. Modeling is not some-
thing all of us do every day, and it can 
be very difficult to do for the first time 
- especially when it is rlgh t in front of 
your peers and classma tes. After the 
show, I hope that they all wa lk away 
with a new sense of confidence, poise 
and a sense of what they can accom-
plish." 

ETS member · Dia na Wong has 
al ready benefited from ETS. 

"I've gained more confiaence as a 
result of ETS; Wong said . "I'm less 
shy, and I can communicate bener." 

Monica Zakowski returns as co-
master of ceremonies this year. 

"I'm honored to be coming back;

TheEditor'sSoa pbox 
By AUSON NORRIS 
Managing Editor 

I can never predict what type of 
reaction I will get when I tell people 
that I'm an editor at the Guardian. 
It's pretty much 50-50 odds that 
people will either cringe or <rct 
honored to meet me. Whether peo-
ple are impressed by the Guardian, 
my revelation is almost always met 
by tirades chock full of advice and 

- constructi ve criticism. However, 
the criticism people typica lly offer 
usually reveals that they actually 
know very little about how UCS D's 
official student newspaper is run -
which encourages me to attempt to 
fa miliarize our readers with the 
methods behind our madness. 

First, I will attempt to explain 
the editing process through which 
our stories are processed. A wri ter 
does his duty, and the fru its of his 
labor are edi ted by his section edi-
tor. Meaning, for example, that a 
sports article first undergoes the 
editing of our sports editor, and a 
news article fi rst faces the red pen 
of the news edi tor - sometimes 
the associate section editors take 
the reigns on this one. 

After being groomed by section 
editors, our stories meet the copy 
editors. These individuals perform 
most of the heavier editing - they 
correct grammatical errors, spelling 
mistakes, incoherent and incom-
plete sentenccs, etc. They also edit 
according to Associated Press style. 
which in light of outsiders' cri-
tiques, is perhaps the most misun-
derstood aspect of our editing 
process. I state this only because I 
have heard many individuals com-
plain that the Guardiall consistently 
contains many mistakes. 

I used to be one of those people: 
Three years ago, I applied to be a 
copy reader specifically because I 
thought I was seeing errors all over 
the official UCSD student newspa-
per, and I was embarrassed fo r their 
obvious blunders. 

However, what I did not rea lize is 
that the Guardiall edi ts according to 
the policies set fo rth in the AP

Stylebook. In short, the AP 
Stylebook is the copy editors' Bible 
- it IS a dictionary-style index of 
almost every term or word that 
could end up in a newspaper article, 
and it explains the official 
Associated Press stance on how and 
when each term should be used, 
techpically and grammatica lly. 

So, when I watch students pick 
up Guardians in front of Center 
Hall and study thei r contents dur-
ing lectu re, it 's my tu rn to cringe 
when I hear people idly complain 
abo ut the errors they sec. Yes, too 
often we let misspell ings and mis-
uses slip through the editing 
process, but most of the time, those 
"errors" are strict renditions of the

rules of our Bible. 

Back to the editing process -
aftcr the copy editors do their 
thing, the article switches paths 
and enters the realm of design . Our 
design editor isn 't responsible for 
editing 'he content of any story like 
section editors and copy editors 
arc. I nst~ad he ensures that each 
story nicely fa lls into place among 
the plethora of advertisements, 
photographs, graphics, etc., that 
fills the rest of our pages. This is 
also the stage during which the art 
produced by our photography and 
graphics editors, and their respec-
tive departments, is placed into our 
pagrs. After all is said and done at 
this stage, each section of the 
newspaper enters the two-stage 
fi nal edi ting process. 

First. an ent ire section (i .e. 

news, sports, hia tus, feat ures, or 
opi nion) is printed ontO 11 - by 17-
inch paper, and these proofs are 
placed into the welcoming, dedi-
cated hands of a managing editor 
(that's what I am), where most of 
the screw-ups that the section edi-
to rs and copy editors didn't catch 
are corrected by way of red ink. 

But don't let me toot my own 
horn - after my corrections are 
made, another set of proofs is given 
to the edi tor in chief. who hacks 
'em up and continually reminds 
me that I will never catch every 
error, no matter how closely I edit. 
It's a very humbling process. 

After the chief corrections arc 
made, every section goes through a 
fina l printing, and these proofs are 
driven by the chief to our printer's 
office, which is in EI Cajon . ur 
dead line is midnight on Sundays 
and Wcdnesdays (because the 
Guardiall comes out on Mondays 
and Thursdays, which I hope you 
already know). 

With every article going through 
at least four pairs of editing eyes 
kg. section editor, copy editor, 
managing editor, and then editor in 
chief), onc might tind It disheartm-
ing to know that we rarely catch 
every mistake. However, rest 
assured that we do our best to lw 
thorough (come on - a minimulll 
of four editors for eYeIY story is a lot 
of manpower), we are certainly 
open to suggestions (as long as it 
isn't another complaint about the

word puzzk only run on Mondays), 
and the AP Stylebook is responsibk 
for the rest. 

Perhaps a beller method of 
attack for those of you still dissatis-
fied with your newspaper, a Illethod 
whi h I can surely vouch for, would 
be to take a look at an AP Stylebook 
and come fill out an application 
with us - we arc on the third floor

open during regular business

good way to make some of that crit-

more constructive.

Fashion: 
ETS has a lot of help 
with this year's show 
Continued from page 14 
such a wonderful cause." 

According to ETS adviser La 
Verne Williams-Schoonover, talks 
about the fashion show bega!1 early 
fall quarter. ETS has striven to host 
a comm unity service event each 
year. In response to the phenome-
nal success of last year's fashion 
show, which raised over $4,000 for 
Becky's House, ETS decided to 
host the event once again. This 
time, the goal is $5,000. 

"I think the caliber of the show 
has defini tely increased this year. 
We have entertainment, a live band 
and it's al l for free," Williams-
Schoonover said. . 

Unlike last year, however, ETS 
has received more help from orga-
nizations on and off ca mpus, 
including S.O.L.O. organization 
Activation Energy Productions and 
the Girls League at La Jolla 
Country Day. 

Founded by Revelle student Ben 
Parcher. AEP aids in the produc-
tlor of chanty-oricnted organiza-
tions. La Jolla Country Day IS a 
national vrganlzation whose San 

DI~go chapta was fo unded by 
Jessica Adler. The Girls League par-
tlcip,nes in community events and 
has al ready raised $1,500 for 
Becky's House. 

Williams-Schoonover would 
like to express her heartfelt appre-
ciation to both organizations for 
their endless support. 

In addit ion to the entertainment 
and fashion show, there will also be 
prizes raffled off at the event. AE P 
Finance Producer Diana Kim sees 
the incentives of buying a raffle 
ticket as rwo-fold.

Delving into East-Asian 
Philosophy Reveals 
Answers to life's Mysteries 

By ZOPYRA 
Special to the Guardian 

Good fe llows, I greet you at the 
advent of a great experiment, For 
the remainder of the quarter, I wi ll 
attempt to provide you wi th spiri-
tual and divine guidance, drawn 
not from the stars, but fro m the 
ancient Chinese oracle, the 1-
Ching. I undertake th is endeavor 
with the humblest reverence for Fu 
I-fsi. its creator, and respect for all 
the interpreters after him, and with 
sincerest hopes that my labors may 
be of benefit to you. 

If you wish to delve further into 
the oracle than [ am able to do 
here, there are several good vol-
umes available at the Geisel 
Library, and numerous online 
resources. Feci free to contact me 
at zopyra@zensearch,net for guid-
ance, or with any question I can ask 

1he oracle for you. 
For -this sixth week of UCS D 

spring quarter, beginning Ma)' 6, I 
make my inquiry with concerns 
from you. 

Zopyra, I keep heari ng bad 
news about Sun God. What's it 
going to be like this year? 

I asked the Oracle: What can we 
expect from the Sun God 
Celebrations? 

The judgment: Hexagram 2, 
The Receptive: "The greatest possi-
ble success, sublime success, is 
obtainable if you are willing to fol-
low good counsel." Wu Wei 

I infer: The best course of action 
is to join with friends of like mind 
wi th regard to festivi ties of this 
sort . The best course of thought is 
to remember that, however hum-
ble, the whole of the fes ti va l is an 
offe ring for your enjoyment. It 
costs linle to pa rtake and wi ll 
reward in great measure those that 
receive it without too much expec-
tation. Avoid arrogance and arro-
gant leaders. 

I undertake this endeavor 
with the humblest 
reverence for Fu Hsi, its 
creat01; and respect for all 
the interpreters after.-him, 
and with ~incerest hopes 
that my labors may be of 
benefit to you. 

For those inclined to doubt , I 
will say that this reading of Pure 
Yin is exceedingly rare and 
extremely positive for those with 
virtuous goals or minimal all1bi-
tion. It bodes very well for' all who 
are willing to enjoy this year's Sun 
God Festival on the face of its own 
merits, without resort to wishful 
thinking. 

Zopyra, I voted in the AS elec-
tion, and I know some people who 
won, but what actually happens 

ARENA 

next? 
I asked the Oracle: How can 

students best contribute to the 
transition in A.S. government? 

The judgment: Hexagram 7, 
Collective Forces: "When a large 
group of people is brought togeth -
er, whether by design or incident , 
achieving success and good fortune 
requires a strong leader and strict 
discipline. This is true of an army, a 
social or political organization, a 
public or private gathering, even a 
mob. For the mass to be effective, 
its members must be controlled, 
for then they can act in concert . 
The leader gains control by provid-
ing clear-cut, worthy goals to 
which individuals can dedicate 
themselves, thereby awakening the 
group's enthusiasm. If the leader is 
not the ultimate authority, those' in 
the position of ultimate authority 
must give the leader their full con-
fidence, total authority to act in 
their behalf and complete sup-
por!. " Wu Wei 

J fcc1this needs lillk embellish-
ment on my part. I offer it as rele-
vant to all involved. Administrators 
may choose to read themselves as 
the ultil11ate authority and Jeff 
Dodge and th e A.S. Counci l as the 
leader. All nell' council members 
may read thcmselves as leader or 
lollower. There seems to be a clear 
rel ation ship between this judg-
ment's call for concerted action

favorable results for love 
Continued from pag.17 
and the sweeping victory of the 
Unity slate. 

Zopyra, it's spring and I want 
this girl, but don't know if I should 
make a move or not. I definitely 
want a relationship, but it Seems 
like there's not much time left for 
that this year. 

I asked the Oracle: What can

from pursuing closeness at this 
time. There are limits to all actions, 
but only arrogance is afraid of lim-
itation. 

Let circumstances reduce your 
expectations but not your actions. 
All the judgments favor the 
involvement of groups, be they 
neighbors or friends. Constancy, 
perseverance and other qualities 
that lend themselves to durability 
in relationships hold the key to 
your decision. If you have these 
wi th in yourself, proceed immedi-
ately and you can only advance. 

This moving judgment arrives 
finally at hexagram 
8, interpreted by 

people expect if 
they pursue the 
initiation of a 
romantic relation-
ship this late in the 
academic year? 

The judgment: 
Hexagram 15, 
Modesty, with old 
yin in line 5 and 
old yang in line 3, 
which cause move-
ment to hexagram 
8, Holding 
Together: UThings

clearly urges both 
partiCipation and 
reflection. Discard 
any idle infatuation. 
Contemplate onry 
relationships you 
are ready to involve 
yourself with, and 
then do so. 

Richard Wi lhelm as 
follows : "Holding 
together brings 
good fortune. 
Inquire of the ora-
cle. once again 
whether you pos-
sess sublimity: con-
stancy and perse-
verance; then there 
is no blame. Those 
who are uncertain 
gradually join. 
Whoever comes 
too late meets with 
misfortune." The 

Ult is difficult to maintain modesty 
in the face of acclaim. Modesty, 
however, is essential to your con-
tinued success." Wu Wei, line 3. 
"An aggressive action could, in fact , 
be consistent with humbleness if 
the inner self remains modest." Wu 
jing-Nuan, line 5.

Continued from page 24 
left, th~n later scored·on a single by Angie Carr. 

But th e big blow was provided by Menee, 
who tripkd off the center field wall to score 
two more runs. 

With Martinelli cruisi ng through the 
Roadrunner lineup, this would be more than 
enough to win . Bakersfield wasn 't able to get 
a runner in scoring posi tion until the fourth 
inning, and was unable to get a runner at 
third the whole game. 

However, the Tritons weren 't finished, as 
Searing scored again in the bottom of the 
sixth on a single by Kim Vorsatz to push the 
lead to 4-0 and put the game out of reach. 

"We came out to win and we finished 
strong," Gerckcns sa id. "We played with a lot 

of pride." 
In Friday action, the Tritons split a pair of 

games with Cal State Dominguez Hills at 
home. They won the first 1-0, but lost the 
second 3-1. 

For seniors Jeani ne Cordero, Vorsatz , 
Searing and Michelle Wilson, the win over 
Bakersfield was most likely their last game as 
Tritons. 

According to Gerckens, UCSD doesn't 
have much of a chance to make postseason 
play, despite finishing with a stellar record of 
21-11. 

"Our chances aren't looki ng good at this 
point," she said. "We n~eded to sweep Bak-
ersfield." 

However, looking back on the season, 
Gerckcns considers it a definite success. 

"It was a great way to b~gin competition 
in Division II ," she said. "This team set a 
standard for the future. I'm going to miss my 
seniors - their leadership is the reason we 
did so well this season."

Goodbye to the Tritons' Best of the Best 
Three-time national champs Dostalek and Abi za id to graduate 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The time has come to say good-
bye to two UCSD athletes who 
were more than just members of a 
team - they were champions 
through and through. 

This June. Cindy Dostalek and 
Christy Abizaid of the UCSD 
women's soccer team will be grad-
uating, taking their champiohship 
style out into the world. 

"There was so much in my col-
lege experience, and what I learned 
in college in general, that lowe to 
the team: said Abizaid, a Marshall 
student who is earning a degree in 
psychology. "I played with so many 
different kinds of people on the 
field during my four years, and the 
most important thing was who they 
were and the ultimate personality 
of the team. Every year it's differ-
elll, and every year it's equally as 
special." 
. Dostalek is also a Marshall stu-
dent and is majoring in political 
science with a minor in communi-
cation. It wasn't the path she had 
planned to take when she came in. 

"IUCSD's] bio program was one 
of the best in the nation: she said, 
"I was strictly going for my acade-
mic interests. Soccer was always 
something that I did on the side 
because it was fun, and I loved to 
play, If I could still play in co llege, it 
would be a bonus." 

The way these two athletes 
came to UCSD was very different. 

"Christy came across us," said 
head coach Brian McManus. "She 
recruited us. She wrote to me, She 
told me about her background. I 
checked the 'background of the 
clubs that she's worked in and they 
were good clubs. This was some-

where she really wanted to come: 
Abizaid was an Army child and 

lived in Germany during her last 
year of high school. 

"I decided I wanted to go to San 
Diego," she said. "I came here and 
found out that this team was Divi-
sion III national Ichampions] - I 
didn 't know what that meant. I 
knew that it meant they were good, 
but I didn 't know if it meant I could 
compete. It was intimidating to 
come, [to decidel not to play and 
then decide to play on the spur of 
the moment and rea lize what I was 
getting myself into." 

Abizaid was vacationing when 
she decided on her future. 

"It was an interesting turn of 
events, and I wouldn 't have had it 
any other way: she said. "It was 
kind of an accident that we all 
found each other." 

Dostalek was recruited in a 
more traditional fashion . 

"Cindy had lived up in L.A,," 
McManus said. "She had been in 
touch with me. I went and watched 
her playa couple of times. She told 
me that she decided that she was 
coming to this school. When you 
saw her play, you saw her place. 
You knew that she would be an 
effect anywhere she Iplayed]. 
There's no substitute for speed." 

The two superstars were 
recruited as Division II I players. 
Last year, the school moved to 
Division II. a whole new ball game. 

"The two of them cou ld have 
played at Division I schools, " 
McManus saId. "At least three 
quarters of the players in this 
squad cou ld play at Division I 
without a doubt. When wc recruit 
players, we recruit soccer players. 

ot Division Ill , II or I. We go for 
the best players we can get. There 

[have) been a lot of players that 
have come through, but these two 
could have played at Division I." 

Dostalek and Abizaid each 
brought something special to the 
playing field . 

"Christy always brought a very 
high level of energy since her very 
first freshman game," McManus 
said. UI played her in the first game 
- put her in after about l S min-
utes. She went in and scored one 
her very first fresh man game. She 
was an impact player right from day 
one." 

Dostalek was equally special. 
"Hcr pace," McM anus said . 

"Her tolerance for pain . She's bcen 
injured a lot. She's played with 
them, right through them. A lot of 
her injuries have been self-inflicted 
because she doesn't know when to 
hold back. Every time she goes 
onto the field , it's 1,000 miles an 
hour, nothing less. She brings that. 
She lifts tea ms. There's games 
where she's lifted the team on her 
own by runs she's made. It's an 
unwritten thing that you can't find 
in other players. She JUSt brings 
that one quality that tcams don 't 
have." 

The two women brought th ings 
to the playing field that are not 
always obvious. 

"One of the biggest things they 
brought to the team was honesty," 
McManus said. "They are so hon-
est as playe rs. You know that 
they're never going to give any less. 
In fact , if they're not playing well. 
they'll say, 'Take me off.' They 
would rather come out than stay 
on the field for the sake of staying 
on the field . Even when they'r~ 
having a bad game, they're going to 
give you evcrything. They're not 
going to back off."

Adieu: UCSD's Cindy Dostalek and Christy Abizaid brought their spi.rial style and 
champumship trophies to the campus as star women's soccer playt.'rS. 

Both Dostalek and Abizaid 
started playing soccer a t a very 
young age. And how they ended 
their college careers couldn 't be 
better material for Hollywood: 
Abizaid dished an assist to 
Dostalek, who kicked a goal with 
1 S seconds left. Oh yeah , it was for 
the national championship. 

"The two of them sta rted 
together," McManus said . "They 
roomed together virtually ever 
since. They're the closest of friends 
you'll ever meet. They'll be life-
long friends. That's how close they 
arc." 

All in all, Abizaid and Dostalek 
won three championships in fo ur 
years. 

"There 's thc team aspect I'll 
always love. It's th e pace," Abizaid 
said. "The cont inuous motion . It's 
a player'S game. Ultimately, you're 
going to decide what you're going 

to do with that ball at any giv~n 
time. You have to read the gam~ 
and pick and choose your moment 
to do what you know how to do 
best. I think it takes a certain 
amount of intelligence and drive to 
play it. You run for 90 minutes 
straight. It's been an amazing four 
years, I wouldn 't have changed any 
of tt." 

eedless to say, their careers 
have been special. 

"I've learned so much and have 
grown so much since I'vc gone to 
UCSD," Dostalek said. "The situa-
tions I've come to handle and the 
way I relate with people. You pick 
up a lot of life skill s. Every one of 
th ose national championships 
stands out in my mind. It was 
unbelievable to Will that tlmd onl'. 
I was very fortunate for thl' SltCC~SS 
that I had. I've had evl'ry athktc 's 
dream come true lhrc~ times.

ROBERT FULTON 

I am a spons fan through ,md through. There arc some spons that I enjoy 
more th,1I1 others. I love watching 
professlOn,ll football I also like 
watching pro basketball. but only 
dUring the playoffs. At th~ DI\'lslon 
I college level. there is nothlllg 
quite like football's bowl season 
and basketball's i'.larch i'.ladness 
Those ar~ thll1g~ we sports fans 
base our scheduics around. 

I ,lIso love to WJtch UCSD ath-
ktlcs. I don't discrimillate. Watch-
Ing playoff-caliber dnd national 
Lh,lInplOnS 15 great, but It'S not too 
b,ld to watch somc of ou r tcams 
that have enjoyed less success. The 
men's basketballtcam had an awful 
season, but with many of thc 
games It was in the thick- of things 
at half-time. Heck, It IS all about 
pride - Triton pride. 

A couple of my favorite sports 
Jre women's soccer and softball. 
It 's 110t a gender thing. I Just like 
the slow pace of softball. dnd our 
0'.' 11 women 's soccer team, which 
kicks everyone's ass, rea lly got me 
high on th e sport. 

Hockey IS one of those sports 
that I am not that interested 111. 
Yeah, I follow It some, esplTially 
dUrlllg the playoffs. 

I have noth ing against hockey 
- It IS a great sport, fun to watch, 
and I have a lot of respect fo r those 
",he) play It. 

Herr IS all interesting commCll-
tar\,: I can name but a fcw hockev 
players, and one of those players I-S 
TIC Dom!. 

He plays for the Toronto i'. laple 
Leafs. The reason I know of him is 
1l0t beca use of his ski ll . but 
because he's an ass. 

See, he IS what is ca lled an 
enforcer. His job is to knock peo-
ple down and out. He did just th.!t 
the other I1Ight, knocking out Rob 

~Iedermye r of the ew Jersey 
Devils. I 'iedermyer is out for a 
while. Domi IS also out for the 
playoffs, suspended by the 
National Hockey League. Bu t I 
know who he his. 

It's a sad sta te for professional 
hockey. You would think that those 
at the top would try to market 
themselves a little better. I mean, 
obViously they are getting atten-
tion, but for all of the wrong rea-
sons. 

Speaking of women's soccer, 
here is a little tidbit: The new 
women's soccer league, the 
Women's United Soccer Associa-
tion, is immensely popular. It has 
great players and great marketing. 
Saturday night 's San Diego Spirit 
game sold out (again). I think this 
league has a legitimate shot at sur-
vival. 

Now, if only those at the top of 
the XFL gang could get a clue. 

In other news, I just watched the 
Lakers beat the Kings in their first 
game of their seven-game senes. 
That makes 12 straight for the boys 
from Los Angeles. Now, is there 
any doubt that they will be holding 
the championship trophy come 
June? Check back with me during 
finals.

Second Place for Softball 
A spl it with Bakersfield gives the Tritons a three-way tie for second 
place in the CCAA, possible playoff berth 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD met Ca l State Universi-
ty Bakersfield fo r a doubleheader 
filled with playoff implica tions 
Saturday at Triton Softba ll Field. 
The Tritons came into the day 
with a record of 20-10 in league, 
which placed them in a tie for sec-
ond place wi th Bakersfield . 

Needing a sweep to carn a 
postseason berth, UCSD was 
unable to come up with a victory 
In the first game and lost 3-4. In 
the second game, the Tntons easj.. 
ly disposed of the Roadrunners 4-
O. 

On a beautiful day, backed by a 
large crowd loud music and the 
raucous cheers of the UCSD pep 
band, the Tritons staned off on the 
wrong foot in the first game as the 
tirst CSUB batter, Alicia Castro, 
doubled off Triton pitcher Leca 
Harlan. Castro later scored 011 an 
error. Errors would plague UCSD 
throughout the game. 

In the top of the third, Bakers-
field struck again, this time scor-
Ing three runs on two hits and 
another Triton error. Freshman 
Roadrunner Katie King supplied a 
key single during the rally to drive 
In two for CSUB.

No soup for you: Tnton catcher Kristin Hunstean gets CSU Bakmfikd's jackie Goodin at home with a force out, then proceeds to 
thmw to Jim base to complete the double-play, 

However, UCSD battled back 
in the fifth, as freshman designat-
ed hitter Christina Strollo worked 
the Roadrunner pitcher to a full 
co unt. then drew a walk to lead off 
the Inning. After right tielder Kiln 
Vorsatz was unable to put down a 
sacrifice bunt , a wild pitch allowed 
Strollo to head to second ,lI1d Vor-
satz singled on the next pitch to 
move her to third. 

Strollo scored with the help of 
freshman Amy Mettee, who hit a 
sacrifice fly to put the Tritons on 
the board. Taking advantage of 
Roadrunner pi tcher Melanie 
Wood's wildness (s he had five 
walks and three wi ld pitches in the 
inning) , the Tritons were able to 
push two more runs across to 
make the score 3-4. 

Unfortunately, that would be 
UCSD's last scoring opportunity.

Wood fou nd her control and faced 
the minimum over the next two

Triton head coach Patti Gerck-
ens cited fie lding as the di fference 
between the two teams in the first 
game. 

"IWe should havel made less

would have taken both games,"

Men's Tennis Season Comes to a Quick Halt 
Tritons fall to BYU-Hawaii in the second round of the west regionals 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCS D men's tennis team 
headed to th e is lands to face 
Brigham Young University- Hawaii 
in the second round of the CM 
West Regiona l Championships on 
Friday. 

The winner of this tournament 
was to go to the Division II cham-
pionships in Florida. 

Don't make any travel plans. 
To recap the tourn ament's 

sta tistics up to Friday: The Tri-
tons came into the match with a 
record of 1 0-9, defeating Ca l Poly 

Pomona 5-0 in the first round . 
The Tritons carri ed a two-game 
winning streak - both against 
Pomona - which came into the 
tournament with a record of 26-
2. 

The key for the Tritons was to 
stop the top doubles players on 
th e BYUH team . BYUH has 
dominated the West region and 
looked to take th e Tritons out of 
the match quickly and early. To 
their credit, the Tritons neutral-
ized th e top players of the 
Pomona squad, and UCSD 
looked to do the same against ' 
BYUH. 

tate-Breaking Sports News 

On Friday, il'towevcr, the ideal 
scenario' was not the case. BYUH 
took a 2-1 lead after the doubles 
matches, with Peter Madarassy 
and Hung Soon Park winning 8-5 
at No. 1 doubles against Jeff Wil-
son and Cory Moderhak. 

Seasiders Daouda Ndiaye and 
Logan WOOlley won 8-3 at the No. 
3 slots against Dan Albrecht and 
Everett Schroeter. 

The lone bright spot for the 
Tritons was the victory notched by 
Sameer Chopra and Michael 
Meyer, as they won their No. 2 
doubles match 8-4. 

Eddie Mere gave the Seasiders 

a 3-1 lead by beating Dan Albrecht 
at No. 4 si ngles, 6-2, 6-2. At the 
No, 3 singles match, Jeff Wilson 
could not muster a win as Andrew 
Makarevich won, 6-4, 6-1. Daou-
da Ndiaye sealed the match with a 
6-2,6-4 win at NO.5 against Blake 
Wilson-Hayden of UCSD. 

As the UCSIJ men's tennis 
season comes to an end , the ath-
letes can look forward to a bright 
season next year. 

With five freshmen returning, 
the squad will have more experi-
ence and composure '0 face the 
toughest opponents Division II 
can offer.
