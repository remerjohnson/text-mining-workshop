DO YOU THINK RACISM 
IS A PROBLEM ON 
CAMPUS? 

‘SHUT IT DOWN’
By Angela Chen
News Editor

Student protesters occupied the Chancellor’s 
Complex for over six hours on Friday, calling for 
administrators to shut down the university and 
respond to a list of demands issued one week 

before by the Black Student Union. 
The BSU altered their requests  

from the original 32 demands to a 
conslidated list. For example, the 
BSU no longer calls for a change 
to a holistic admissions system, 
but instead wants the current 
comprehensive review system to 

include additional points for first-generation 
students and those who attended schools in the 
fourth or fifth quintile. 

The sit-in was in response to the discovery of 
a noose hanging from a light fixtureon the sev-
enth floor of Geisel Library on Feb. 25 — the lat-
est in a string of racially charged events, includ-
ing a “Compton Cookout” party held Feb. 15 and 
slurs aired on Student-Run Television Feb. 18. 

According to a police bulletin e-mailed to all 
students and faculty Thursday night, the UCSD 
police received reports of a noose — histori-
cally used in black lynchings — at approximately 
10:30 p.m. on Feb. 25. The incident is being 
treated as a crime with “intent to terrorize.” 

Leaders of the BSU immediately planned 
a protest for the following morning at 8 a.m. 
The Library Walk rally drew approximately 300 
participants, including speakers from BSU, the 
LGBT community and faculty. 

Sociology professor Ivan Evans spoke heav-
ily about the “special horror of lynching” and 
called for the students to take direct action.

Ihave a story that needs to be heard. I am the girl you’ve read about, the one who hung the noose in Geisel Library.
Firstly, I’m writing to apologize. I don’t have 

an excuse for what I did, and I deeply regret it. 
Secondly, I’m writing to hopefully put a little 

bit of faith back into the UCSD campus by clari-
fying that it was not an act of racism. This is what 
happened.

Activists at UC Irvine and UCLA 
have responded to three race-related 
incidents at UCSD over the last two 
weeks, holding demonstrations in sup-
port of black students at UCSD.

At around 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 24, a 
group of about 20 UCI students and 
employees barricaded themselves 
into the UCI administration building. 
One hour later, they issued a list of 15 
demands including increased funding 
for the ethnic studies department — a 
request motivated by the recent events 
at UCSD.

“As evidenced so blatantly at UCSD 
this past week, black subjects are in an 
antagonistic position against the insti-
tution; this sentiment is reinforced by 
administration, and creates a safe space 
for anti-blackness,” they stated in the 
document. 

Seventeen students and universi-
ty employees were cited for unlawful 
assembly and refusal to disperse, lead-
ing to the protest’s breakup at 2:40 p.m. 

Students at UCLA held their own 
sit-in on Feb. 26. Led by the Afrikan 
Student Union of UCLA, about 100 
protesters occupied the office of UCLA 
Chancellor Gene Block and demanded 
that he pressure Fox into taking deci-
sive action against racism at UCSD.

Students looking to add a shiny new 
card to their wallets will have to start 
buttering up their parents. The Credit 
Card Responsibility and Disclosure 
Act, effective Feb. 21, has placed new 
restrictions on credit-card companies, 
including a provision that requires all 
those under 21 to have a co-signer 
when opening a new line of credit.

The federal legislation aims to 
prevent credit-card companies from 
exploiting consumers. According to 
Gregory Cendana, president of the 
United States Students Association,

“They have gone where they should 
not have gone, and I believe we should 
respond appropriately,” he said. “I don’t 
believe it is the chancellor’s role to shut 
the university down, and I believe it 
would be difficult for her to do so. I 
believe it is our role to do that.”

Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo referenced the recent reac-
tion from members of student media 
organizations to A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta’s funding freeze last Friday, a 
reaction to BSU requests to shut down 
controversial humor newspaper the 
Koala. Prevo said this was not a free-
speech issue.

“The Bill of Rights, in which the 
free-speech document came from, 
was never meant to include my peo-
ple — our people — so how do you 
expect me to respect free speech, 
when I was never supposed to have 
free speech?” Prevo asked.

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
emerged from the Chancellor’s 
Complex to speak to the crowd. She 
said all criminal violators would be 
punished.

Vice Chancellor of Resource and 

Management Gary Matthews then 
came forward, revealing that a female 
student had confessed to hanging 
the noose around 9:30 a.m., and had 
turned in her two accomplices. 

According to a letter to the 
Guardian from the student who hung 
the noose, the incident was “a mind-
less act and stupid mistake.” The stu-
dent, whose identity has not been 
released, has been suspended for an 
indefinite period of time. 

California Law AB 412, passed 
in August 2009, states that hanging 
a noose in a public area is a misde-
meanor punishable up to a year in 
jail and a $5,000 fine. However, the 
suspended student has not yet been 
taken into custody.

Protesters expressed their unhap-
piness with the administration reac-
tion, and marched to the Chancellor’s 
Complex at noon. 

Fox emerged once more to assure 
protesters that the university was tak-
ing action against hate on campus.

“I strongly condemn the offen-
sive acts of hate and bias that have 
occurred over the past days,” Fox said.  
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 

Penny Rue echoed Fox’s sentiments. 
“You can’t imagine how pained 

we are over this,” she said. “We are 
heartsick.”

However, Fox made no mention 
of a campus shutdown, prompting 
protesters to pressure her to meet 
with the Academic Senate to deter-
mine if one was feasible. Meanwhile, 
demonstrators moved into Fox’s 
office to host an impromptu sit-in. 

At approximately 2 p.m., the 
chancellor said she saw no reason 
for a shutdown, causing protesters to 
occupy her office until 5 p.m.

At 5:30 p.m., members of the BSU 
emerged from their meeting with 
Fox to announce that she had not 
adequately met their demands. 

“They handed us over a bullshit-
ass document,” BSU Vice Chair 
Fnann Keflezighi said to the crowd 
after the meeting. “Basically, it said 
everything that we already knew, 
no concrete things on how they’re 
going to implement anything. They’re 
dumber than we thought they were 
— dumber than I thought they were.”

Block responded by reading a letter 
signed by UC President Mark Yudof 
and the other nine UC chancellors — 
including Fox — that condemned the 
acts of intolerance at UCSD.

“We will not allow the actions of 
a few to speak for this University,” the 
statement read. “We denounce them. 
We have a responsibility to speak out 
against activities that promote intoler-
ance or undermine civil dialogue. As 
always, the remedy for bad speech is 
good speech.”

The ASU was moved to act when 
the BSU sent a letter to organizations 
at various UC campuses on Feb. 19, 
declaring a “state of emergency” at 
UCSD.

“Please stand on solidarity with our 
Brothers and Sisters from UCSD ... Our 
students at UCSD are being silenced 
and made uncomfortable,” the ASU 
said in a statement posted on their 
Web site.

NEWS� MONDAY, MARCH 1, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

According to the 11-page document 
responding to the BSU’s original demands, the 
university will begin taking steps to create a per-
manent task force to increase diversity aware-
ness on campus and fill the vacant program-
coordinator position for the African-American 
Studies Minor. (The full text of this document 
can be found online at www.battlehate.ucsd.edu/
docs/implementation_of_demands.pdf.)

 Despite escalating racial tensions on cam-
pus, many demonstrators expressed the belief 
that the incident has created greater solidarity 
within the UCSD community. 

“I came to the protest because I’m part of this 
community and this coalition,” Muir College 
senior Indiana Rogers said. “These are people 

that I know, and people that are being disgraced.”
In addition, members of the Newman Center 

Catholic Community at UCSD planned to spread 
roses in Geisel Library at the site where the noose 
had been hung to show support for the BSU.

“We wanted to put something loving there 
instead of something so hateful,” said Anita 
Bradford, a graduate student in the history 
department. “We wanted to show our support.”

The  BSU plans to mobilize again on March 
1 at 10 a.m. on Library Walk, where they will 
continue to pressure the administration to 
adhere to their demands.

It’s hard to believe the “Compton Cookout” was only two weeks ago today. Two emotionally 
charged rallies and teach-ins later  — 
snowballed by idiot moves from the 
Koala and an anonymous girl with 
a rope — racial tensions on campus 
have reached epic proportions. 

When you Google “UCSD” and 
the first predictive text that comes up 
is “UCSD noose,” you know you’ve 
got a problem.

Interestingly enough, if each of 
the three racist incidents is consid-
ered in isolation, it becomes clear 
that a couple ignorant/unfeeling 
individuals with too much time on 
their hands have managed to set our 
campus up in flames.

Elliot Van Nostrand and his 
bros copied some Urban Dictionary 
definitions and tied them to Black 
History Month — a bad joke that was 
not theirs to make, of course, but one 
they somehow had little idea would 
appall the students it targeted. Koala 
Editor in Chief Kris Gregorian was 
undoubtedly more aware of the dag-
ger he was throwing on Student-Run 
Television, but his clan has a long 
history of exploiting the right to hate 
speech, and it was only timing that 
gave one self-important idealogue 
this power to do real harm. (In addi-
tion, the cardboard scrap reading 
“Compton lynching” later found in 

the studio is known to have been 
written as a joke prompt by a nonstu-
dent standerby. Stupid.) Most recent-
ly, the female student who came 
forward for leaving a noose in Geisel 
Library claims it was out of clueless 
negligence; so whether or not she’s 
just playing dumb, the girl doesn’t 
seem to be out to get anybody.

Unfortunately, intent does not 
change the severity of effect — 
especially when the face ratio of 
non-black aggressors to the victims 
of their “joke” (who lack the luxury 
of finding it funny, or access to any-
thing near as hurtful in the weapon 
cabinet of history with which to fight 
back) is 100 to one. Add a followup 
shitstorm of Internet commentary 
and gleeful side-picking, and it’s 
apparent why the “toxic environ-
ment” at UCSD has become so slimy.

As we can see, the danger is much 
larger than this motley crew of fire-
starters. There may not be visible 
protests against the campus-diversi-
fying demands of the Black Student 
Union, but a thunderous sentiment 
can be heard across Facebook 
threads and cafeteria whispers: The 
20,000 students not marching in 
solidarity with the BSU are jumping 
to the defensive conclusion that black 
students’ demands are too dramatic, 
or that this is a simple issue of free 
speech, and all those hurt by racial 

comments don’t have the right to not 
be offended.

No, the malicious gut feeling cur-
rently permeating UCSD cannot be 
blamed on three isolated flareups of 
ignorance, but on the blank stares 
they have unveiled and spiteful mur-
murs they have uncorked. Anyone 
who still thinks there is no racism at 
this school, after witnessing the righ-
teous reaction of the general populous 
to the pain of the targeted few, with 
no concept of the inequality from 
birth between races in our country, 
should indeed be dragged kicking and 
screaming into the general-education 
requirements the BSU has proposed. 

When a cornerstone of American 
society like the black population, 
whose presence at this university 
means exponentially more than its 
sparse percentage, feels so threatened 
as to not be able to enter their own 
library, it becomes all of our problem.

Let’s prioritize here. Yes, A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta breached 
the trust of all student publications 
on campus — not to mention the 
content-neutral principles of the First 
Amendment — by pulling media-org 
funding in the name of cutting off 
the Koala. And believe us, he will get 
what’s coming to him. But it’s impor-
tant to separate that issue from the 
social justice the BSU is requesting; 
they are not asking for anyone else to 

be silenced, and wouldn’t have that 
jurisdiction anyway. They are only 
asking for outreach and retention, so 
they can exist on campus with the 
critical strength that would give them 
a fighting chance to resist — or at least 
not feel crushed or attacked — when 
slurs conjuring the violent oppression 
of their ancestors are thrown around 
in the name of freedom.

With the exception of a few hun-
dred students willing to trek out in 
support of the BSU at 8 a.m. — or 
at least become more educated on

The prospect of sleeping on a stranger’s floor in a foreign country raises a number 
of questions: How many sweaty, 
unclothed travelers past have grazed 
this blanket? Should I run and find a 
hostel before it’s too late? Is it cool to 
borrow toothpaste?

How-to Guru knows firsthand that 
couch-surfing is a daunting activity. 

That’s why, armed with a summer’s 
worth of cramped necks and awkward 
breakfasts, the Guru is here to help. 

Those first moments on the 
doorstep before an affirming 
“wilkommen” or “bienvenidos” present 
a huge opportunity for self-doubt. 
On my first surf, though, before there 
was any time to reconsider, the door 
opened and a tall, beaming hipster 
came out to hug me. Within five 
minutes, I was offered a joint, a beer 
and homemade pizza — I was hooked.

It’s hard to resist a strong German 
ale, but it’s still important to be 
discriminating. The first rule of 

cautious travel is this: 
Do your research. 
Read through your 
potential host’s profile 
on www.couchsurfing.
org before contacting 
him; a section featuring 
references from people 
who have either hosted 
or surfed with the 

member will help you decide whose 
sofa is right for you. Though an online 
testimonial may not be a 100-percent 
guarantee that you’ll wake up with 
all your limbs and sleepwear intact, 
hardcore couch-surfers take their sport 
pretty seriously, and won’t vouch for 
someone for no reason.

Just to be safe, hit up several hosts 
at once — and never set out without a 
backup plan. The last thing you want 
is to find yourself alone in a foreign 
city with nowhere to crash. So even if 
all your couch-surfing prospects fall

Dear Editor,
I know you’ve received numer-

ous e-mails and calls about the recent 
discovery of the noose, and also word 
on future noose hangings. I know the 
racial tensions at UCSD are running 
very high right now, but I refuse to 
believe that this overt racism exists at 
UCSD, and I’m challenging the exist-
ing thought paradigm that the Black 
Student Union is being marginalized. 
Its voice is being heard — and excuse 
me if I’m wrong — but the noose 
found in Geisel Library on Thursday 
night “validates” BSU feelings of being 
threatened and gives it a bigger voice. 
So I wouldn’t rule out the intentional 
planting of the noose to provoke and 
escalate the issue in BSU’s favor.

This is more than a case of playing 

devil’s advocate; I heard (in passing) 
members of BSU talking about a 
noose in the library after last nights 
A.S. open forum meeting, which 
ended at 10 p.m. According to news 
reports, the noose was found mid-
night of the same night. How did they 
know about it before it happened, 
and why didn’t BSU mention this at 
the meeting if they knew about the 
noose in advance? I’m not making an 
unsubstantiated claim here — I even 
saw the same person in the original 
noose photo who was talking about it 
at the meeting.

Dear Editor, 
We are mad at the system that 

we feel has repressed us. We want to 
be free; we want to overcome; we 
want to win. But we cannot fight 
for freedom and peace, because the 
very nature of a fight precludes both 
freedom and peace — in fact, it per-
petuates the cycle of oppression. It 
necessitates that one party prevails 
over another, and in that scenario, 
both sides feel threatened and react 
accordingly. Fighting against some-
thing merely serves to reinforce 
it. What is called for, then, what 
pounds in our hearts and brings us 
flocking together, is a yearning for 
awareness; a shift in consciousness.

Suss it out. On what level does 
the issue exist? It is a matter of 
human emotion and how we choose 
to express our feelings? Is this war-
fare, or welfare? 

Discrimination is supposed to 
be illegal, but how can we prosecute 
perception? We have arrived at the 

reality of how people treat each 
other. This is about human rights 
and it’s inextricable from any other 
inconsideration committed by one 
person against another. Repression, 
crime and war are all symbolic of the 
isolation of the psyche, just as com-
ing together to create a movement 
for positive change is symbolic of the 
connection of the soul. 

Over the course of history we 
have won many battles — only to 
keep fighting. This is the human 
condition. We are all hurt. We’ve got 
to stop fighting and start feeling. To 
truly succeed in making a change, 
we must first cultivate a deeper 
awareness of the atmosphere we are 
creating … We must infuse ourselves 
with compassion, understanding and 
acceptance. (This is the only state of 
mind in which we can actually LIVE, 
not just visit on the weekends.)

Secret to destroying the enemy? 

Love it to death. In the light of love, 
the enemy disappears. It is only our 
own shadows that prevents us from 
seeing each other and treating each 
other as equals. It’s a collective effort 
that must be taken personally; we 
can only be responsible for our own 
emotions and emissions. Keep an 
open heart.

into a stranger’s digs, the real fun 
begins. Couch-surfing is way more 
than a way to score free shelter — it’s 
a way of life. Your hosts will generally 
be a young, open-minded crowd. Play 
your cards right, and they’ll be eager 
to show you a night on the town. 

Both hosts and fellow surfers 
are always eager to talk about their 
experiences. Some of Guru’s best 
couch-surfing memories have 
been just hanging out around the 
kitchen table, comparing cultures 
and exploring new ways of life over 
a beer. 

Always follow house rules. Don’t 
overstay your welcome, and don’t 
be that annoying little sister begging 

your hosts to take you out every night 
— remember, these are people who, 
not unlike your freewheeling self, go 
to school and have jobs. And upon 
your departure, don’t forget to give 
back in some way. This can mean 
cooking a meal, doing the dishes, 
fixing their bike or (if you really want 
to be invited back) buying them a 
bottle of wine. Hosts that can vouch 
for you make it much easier to earn 
invitations from all over the world. 

Don’t knock sleeping on borrowed 
ground ’til you’ve tried it. Your pillow 
might predate the Berlin Wall, but 
it’ll be a more memorable night than 
you’d get at the Marriott.

the topic — the student body has 
responded with apathy. The noose was 
in the library for two days without 
anybody reporting it. And in many 
cases, apathy has even grown fangs. 
How is it necessary to start a group 
called “UCSD Students Outraged 
That People Are Outraged About 
the Compton Cookout” or “UCSD 
Students Against the Demands of the 
UCSD BSU”? Just because someone 
got it together before you to demand 
what they deserve from the university, 
you don’t have to degrade one of the 
most necessary fights in our history 
— the civil-rights movement, which is 
not over by any means — by rattling 
off some uninformed babble about 

basing treatment on academic merits, 
not the color of one’s skin. If we exist-
ed in isolation of history, if we had 
all started in wigs with feather pens, 
there might be less of a need for this 
moment of solidarity. Just because our 
ancestors messed up the possibility of 
self-sustaining social justice doesn’t 
mean we’re free from the responsibil-
ity to recognize their shortcomings 
and do all we can to right that wrong.

Predictably, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox mostly avoided solid fis-
cal solutions to the BSU’s bold list 
of demands in her Friday-afternoon 
address. But if the amount of drive 
they have shown so far is any indica-
tion, they will not stop until every 
proposed task force has made at least 

one step toward strengthening their 
chances of survival on this campus. 
It may seem dramatic, but without 
the most extreme and comprehensive 
request to stabilize the black popu-
lation on campus and educate the 
rest, toxic environments like this will 
remain possible, and extremists like 
the Koala will exist as a tool of mar-
ginalization instead of ridiculousness.

I know you didn’t personally limit 
black opportunity in this country, but 
when you fail to recognize there is 
a problem, you become a part of it. 
So instead of wasting your time cut-
ting down a people who have never 
received anything but the short end 
of the stick, let’s show a little love and 
admiration.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

I found a small piece of rope 
on the ground earlier in the day. 
While I was hanging out with my 
friends a bit later, we tried jump-
roping with it and making it into 
a lasso. My friend then took the 
rope and tied it into a noose. I 
innocently marveled at his ability 
to tie a noose, without thinking 
of any of its connotations or the 
current racial climate at UCSD. 
I left soon after with one of my 
friends for Geisel to study, still 
carrying the rope. After a bit of 
studying I picked up the rope to 
play with, and ended up hanging it 
by my desk. It was a mindless act 
and stupid mistake. When I got 
up to leave, a couple hours later, 
I simply forgot about it. This was 
Tuesday night. Three days later, 
on Friday morning, I found out 
that the noose had been found 
and construed as another racist act 

on campus. I felt so ashamed and 
embarrassed, and the first thing I 
did was call the campus police and 
confess. I was hoping to clarify that 
this was not an act of racism before 
the incident got a full reaction from 
the campus. I gave my statement 
around 9 a.m. They thanked me for 
coming forward and for trying to 
clear up the issue. Later, I received 
a campuswide e-mail saying that 
I confessed and had been taken 
into custody, which simply wasn’t 
true. One thing that is true is that I 
have been suspended. I know what 
I did was offensive — regardless 
of my intentions — I am just try-
ing to say I’m sorry. As a minority 
student who sympathizes with the 
students that have been affected 
by the recent issues on campus, I 
am distraught to know that I have 
unintentionally added to their pain.

A Rhode Island school was the recent picture of upheaval, as 
74 teachers and 19 staff members 
were fired due to the school’s pitiful 
academic performance (its gradu-
ation rate is a meager 48 percent). 
The mass firing was a response to a 
failed reform attempt at Central Falls 
High School, ironically titled “The 
Turnaround Plan.”

But with a sizable chunk of stu-
dents siding with the teachers, it’s 
doubtful any of them will react well to 
being taught by a whole new crop of 
vulnerable hires. The negative media 
attention can’t be sending a good ral-
lying message to potential applicants, 
either: “Want job security? Keep 
looking.” The school’s frigid location, 
massive dropout rate and dwindling 
resources make it a less-than-stellar 
place to work to say the least. 

Punishing and rewarding teach-
ers on a merit basis may seem a 
novel idea, but when it translates into 
huge firings, it discourages others 
from entering the field of education 
altogether — or, at the very least, to 
not bother sending an application to 
Central Falls High School. Applicants 
might as well save their time and 
apply to a school on the other side of 
town, where the graduation and turn-
over rates aren’t so dismal and con-
flict is relegated to the football field.

—Neda Salamat
Staff Writer 

The alarming Central High Falls School dropout statistics speak 
for themselves. But firing all 93 staff 
members isn’t the solution to rectify-
ing this educational nightmare. 

The school’s problem runs deeper 
than its faculty. With 63 percent of 
students qualifying for free lunches 
and 41 percent living in poverty, 
students are dropping out work full 
time. 

The district is placing undue 
blame on the easiest scapegoat: 
teachers. Because when teens are 
dropping out of school to work full 
time, even the most inspiring educa-
tors can’t keep them in their seats. 

New employees will likely have 
less experience in the classroom, and 
even less experience in a classroom 
in which one in two students don’t 
have hopes of crossing the stage. 

Instead of skimming the surface 
of the issue, the district should be 
working toward a more comprehen-
sive solution that takes into account 
the difficult lifestyle of the school’s 
students. The district must make 
greater efforts to encourage and 
stress the importance of an educa-
tion — not remove those who may 
have been the only positive role 
models in students’ lives. 

—Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor

The recent firing of Central Falls High School’s 74 teachers was 
obviously a risky move — but the 
school’s abysmal graduation rate 
proves it was also a necessary one. 
When less than half the class is even 
graduating, it’s a surefire indicator 
that a school must be reformed. 
In this case, the faculty dismissals 
were, in fact, the final option after 
multiple failed attempts at reform, 
including a request from the state 
to increase the faculty’s workload 
(which the teachers’ union vehe-
mently denied). If one’s job calls 
for overtime but the worker fails to 
perform, someone else who values 
the position more deserves to come 
in — and that’s exactly the case for 
Central Falls High School.

In light of today’s economy, 
when — regardless of lousy pay 
or demanding hours — it’s more 
necessary than ever to cling to a 
job, there’s sure to be a gaggle of 
resume-bearers in the principal’s 
office ready to snatch up whatever 
position they can. The employed 
— and that includes the teachers at 
Central Falls High School — must 
be doing cartwheels to keep that 
paycheck coming back, whether 
they like it or not.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS

the act is a step toward much-needed 
credit-card reform.

Cedana said the act prohibits credit-
card companies from offering gifts to 
students under 21 for opening up credit-
card accounts, preventing exploitation. 

“CitiBank or other companies would 
visit campus and say, ‘Hey, if you open 
a credit card we’ll give you a T-shirt or 
pizza,’” Cendana said.

In addition, credit-card companies 
can no longer send students under 21 
pre-screened credit cards. Previously, 
credit-card companies could issue ready-
to-use cards to potential clients by mail, 
eliminating the application process.

According to Cendana, pre-screened 
cards take advantage of students because 
students are less familiar with the system 
and more likely to accept without being 
aware of the details.

“We found that a lot of companies 
have also been doing targeted mailings 
to lots of students, and it ends up being 
overwhelming,” Cendana said. “We feel 
that there could potentially be other 
ways to fund schooling before taking out 
credit cards.”

The final restriction requires that 
customers under 21 have a co-signer 
— typically a parent — when opening a 
new credit line, unless they have proof 
of adequate income. This is meant to 
protect students from recklessly spend-
ing themselves into debt. 

“I do think it’s a good step,” Revelle 
College freshman Joanna Lee said. “It 
will help students be more responsible 
and less carefree. There won’t just be 
some plastic to use to spend.”

Cendana said the government should 
continue to put additional restrictions 
on credit cards.

“It takes small steps towards reform, 
but there’s larger financial reform that 
needs to be addressed,” Cendana said.

I f you’re sick of La Jolla sand and sun and looking for a change in scenery, consider Denali National Park in Alaska. Stay at a hostel just outside the 
park, where fellow explorers are aplenty. Believe me: 
You’ll appreciate the company while heading off into a 
wilderness filled with real-life grizzly bears and wolves 
by the motherload, helping ensure your trip doesn’t 
end like Christopher McCandless’ journey “Into the 
Wild.”

The park is open late May to mid-September, 
because summer is really the only time to visit. The 
six-million-acre stakeout has just one road: a dirt 
path cleared specifically for the park’s buses. Since 
Denali has few hiking trails, you should grab a bus 
ticket and head down the road on a brief driving 
tour. Take in the reds and greens of the tundra and 
the abundant snowy peaks or ask the driver to let 
you off to hike for a few hours. Once you’ve exhaust-

nce your classical tropical locales get old and 
you need a break from Hawaii or Mexico, 
think a little farther south.

I’m talking about Jamaica — the tropical paradise 
where every smiling face is excited to make you a 
member of the laid-back island family. 

Make like a tourist and hit Jamaica’s Mystic 
Mountain — rainforest adventure park — where you 
can hop on a bobsled and pretend like you’re in “Cool 
Runnings.” To reach the attraction, you get to ride an 
aerial tram through the Jamaican rainforest and glimpse 
the gorgeous Montego Bay. After walking through an 
outdoor Usain Bolt tribute museum, for only $20 you 
can get two tickets to ride — alone or with a partner 
— down a bobsled course through the rainforest. After 
you’ve climbed into your own bobsled, you control the 
speed as you plunge down the twists and turns of the 
3,280-foot track. If you’re still riding an adrenaline high, 
the park also offers a canopy zip-line tour through the 
jungle. Harnessed to a steel cord, you’ll have the oppor-
tunity to literally fly across the top of rainforest. Buying 
an overpriced souvenir photo, of course, is a must. 

Jamaica’s nightlife is filled with pulsating dancehall 
and reggae clubs in all corners of the island. Unlike 
LA clubs where you wait in line like cattle ready to be 
herded inside, Jamaican clubs are an open and welcom-
ing to everyone. The sunset-colored walls are packed 
with locals and vacationers ready to let loose. 

We all know that Jamaica is famous for more than 
just its gorgeous beaches, exotic rainforests and thriv-
ing nightlife. It’s also the home of Bob Marley. and a 
population that shares his love for a certain little green 
herb. It’s a must to tour Marley’s home and sample 
some of the local horticulture.

All in all, check your inhibitions at baggage claim. 
The country is known for partying like there’s no 
tomorrow, and there’s no reason not to take advantage 
of that.

GUIDE

A beautiful country with a long and pain-ful history, Uganda 
has been ravaged by strife 
and war for years; corrupt 
government regimes have 
left it one of the poorest 
countries in Africa. Now that 
colonial and civil wars have 
subsided, travelers can enjoy 
a relatively peaceful journey, 
but visitors are cautioned to 
avoid some northern regions 
and villages still affected by 
the Lord’s Resistance Army. 
But overall, the people of 
Uganda are very friendly 
to foreigners, and travel is 
remarkably affordable.

Because its market 
revolves around agriculture, 
Uganda provides for a wide 
array of landscape photo ops 
— backdropped by the rug-
ged peaks of Mount Kadam, 
tropical forest canopies, vast 
plains and the placid Lake 
Victoria. 

Nothing in Uganda 
overshadows the beauty of 
its people. A proud, tribal 
nation, the wide-eyed energy 
of its residents is worth the 
visit alone. The depth of life’s 
challenges and victories can 
be found in the faces of the 
people of Uganda: They are 
poor in wealth but rich in 
spirit, family and love of life. 

In Uganda, every turn is 
a picture. But photographers 
should be reminded that it’s 
both important and courte-
ous to ask before taking pho-
tos of villagers, since many 
are uneasy around a camera.

I n recent years, the overbuilt city of Dubai has redefined the idea of opulence. Wealthy beyond belief from its convenient location atop a bubbling 
pot o’ oil, the average family income in Dubai exceeds 
$180,000 per year.

However, though Dubai was recently noted for 
being one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, 
overbuilding and debt have left the city in a new state 
of uncertainty — that’s where you come in.

Shop in the world’s largest mall, trek out on a desert 
safari or stare at the city atop Berj Khalifa, the world’s 
tallest building. Explore man-made islands in the shape 
of palm trees, tour an underwater hotel with sharks, 
go skydiving, snowboard indoors or live in your own 
skyscraper. Why not? In Dubai, anything is possible. 
The economy is all “on sale,” but bring your credit card 
— Dubai is still as expensive as it is excessive.

Because the city is bustling with construction, bank-
ing and technological prospects, you’ll tend to meet 
international businessmen more than locals. Dubai 
itself has two sides: the super rich and the super poor. 
As a result, much of the city has been proofed to keep 
the masses at a distance, and access is difficult. You’ll be 
surprised by the lack of public beaches and the enor-
mous entry fees required to enter most common areas. 
Plus, due to the extreme climate, Dubai doesn’t really 
encourage pedestrians to walk the streets — there are 
very few sidewalks.

Of course, for a photographer, Dubai is an archi-
tectural dreamland. Beautiful buildings are everywhere 
you look. Bottom line: Dubai sets the standard for 
excess, so if you’re looking for the next best thing to 
Disneyland, this is the place to be.

T hink of a magical place. One where you step outside and a mango smoothie is pushed into your hand. Where a whiskey and coke comes $2 by the bucket, and counterfeit designer clothing paves the streets. You, my friend, are entering a tropical slice of 
college-student paradise called Thailand.

Cheap beverages and sweet threads aren’t the only charms of Southeast Asia’s backpacking 
Mecca. Thailand’s got everything you could ask from an exotic tropical climate: luscious green 
jungles, long glistening beaches and enough ancient monuments to make a historian jizz his 
cargo pants. Here’s a guide for those who’d like to spend a month or two meandering these hot 
and sweaty lands with purpose to explore and propensity to party. 

First, fly into Bangkok. Check into a hotel just off infamous tourist hotspot Khoa San Road. 
(But not on it — it’s expensive. Don’t pay more than about $13 per night for a hostel.) A night 
out should start at a bar a block or two from the flurry — your dollar will go farther in a place 
where menus aren’t written in English and bartenders don’t have to be polite. 

Spend about a week in Bangkok, half-drunk and blabbering. Shake out all of your embar-
rassing American tendencies. There’s no place more supportive of your wildest Southeast 
Asian fantasies than the country’s capital — just ask the stars of the city’s infamous ping-pong 
shows. You’ll get an answer in the form of a vagina-propelled dart.

When it comes to transportation, know what you want before you step into a tuk-tuk car-
riage. While on the prowl for a ride, an eager English-speaking local gave me three tips to help 

Las Vegas
A fter spending this quarter confined in the suffocatingly sterile walls of Geisel Library, spring break on the vomit-lined streets of Las Vegas is exactly what every repressed UCSD student needs to blow off finals like a rock star. 

Whether cheering on busty strippers at the Kitty Kat Lounge, taunting children pool-
side while six drinks deep, gambling away student loan money at the slot machines or 
stumbling into the Flamingo with a head full of acid in an attempt to channel Hunter S. 
Thompson, there’s no place like Vegas to bring out the freak in all of us.

The grueling five hour drive from San Diego is well worth the brightly lit moment you 
descend upon the Strip. Roll down your windows to let the arid desert heat blast your skin 
and sit back, mesmerized by the bright neon letters that will have your head spinning long 
after the ecstasy has left your spinal cord. 

Be prepared to make it rain, even if it is a shallow downpour. Other than gazing in awe 
at the Fountains of Bellagio and pretending you’re from the cast of “Ocean’s Eleven,” cheap 
entertainment is hard to come by in a city of big spenders. But spring break isn’t the time 
to be worrying about such trivial matters — you’ve passed the whole quarter eating Ramen 
noodles and choking down Popov, so don’t hesitate to throw $40 on the Bellagio Buffet or 
stuff a couple Lincolns down Cheri’s thong.

Go ahead, indulge. Hot-box your car in Barstow, throw up on the Nike statue and shake 
your ass both on and off the dance floor. Just be careful not to crouch down too low — a 
bad case of crabs is one souvenir you don’t want to take home.

L et’s face it: Your liver can’t tell the difference between spring break and the week following your last midterm. But you can. Which leaves no 
excuse for spending the former Jagerbombing yourself 
barfless in Costa Verde. “Flights to Puerto Rico” should 
already be in your search bar.

Out of all the islands eyedropped throughout the 
Caribbean, Puerto Rico stands out not only as the port 
of call for Captain Morgan, but the land mass that 
popularized reggaeton’s bass-heavy blend of Jamaican 
rhythm bloated with salsa and cumbia. In the capital 
city of San Juan — where most visitors spend their time 
after sundown — the slender, cobblestoned streets are 
packed with open-air nightclubs and patio bars, arched 
doorways and dome awnings. 

The legal drinking age in Puerto Rico is, conve-

t’s the oldest story in the book: You’re a travel-buggin’ 
college student, with big dreams and an empty wallet. 
When it comes to convincing your parents that a three-

month trip to Europe could double as a fiscally responsible 
choice, however, it helps if you can spin it as a summer job 
— which is where the term “au pair” comes into play.

An au pair is a live-in nanny. And though it’s an effective 
way to get overseas, make no mistake: Even the most patient 
person in the world will be praying for some alone time 
after a month of sharing space, no matter how cute the little 
French toddlers are.

It’s all worth it, though, when you consider the perks.
For one thing, you’re living in the foreign country of your 

choice for free. Being American, you’re often asked to teach 
small children English, which means you can learn as much 
— or as little — of the language as you like. Either way, you’re 
getting a complete summer immersion — one that many pay 
thousands of dollars to have.

The tricky part is finding a family that fits. Speaking a 
foreign language — even just a little — helps immeasurably 
in your application. Also, saying you love football — that’s 
soccer, to us heathen Americans — is like an international 
passport, provided you don’t get too choosy with your teams 
(a vocal Manchester United supporter may very well get 
passed up by a Chelsea family).

Once you’ve selected and applied to favorite country, 
the easiest way to find a family is through a Web site like 
www.aupairworld.com. You can post your info — in two 
languages, if you want to be fancy — and look up potential 
families’ profiles according to the number of kids they 
have, where they live and how long they want you. The 
only downside is that you will occasionally get e-mails 
from a “nice single father and business man” who is offer-
ing you an exorbitant weekly allowance if you’ll only send 
him a copy of your passport.

The nifty part is that, through such technological advents 
as Facebook, you don’t actually have to fork out the £70 that 
the Web site demands before they hand over a family’s con-
tact information. Get a name, then Google it: chances are

L a Jolla Shores is an eyeful, but it’s got nothing on the beaches of St. Thomas — a star member of the Virgin Islands, off the eastern edge of Puerto Rico. Think 
shell-strewn white sand that melts into a bath of warm turquoise 
water, a hammock tied between two gently swaying palm trees and 
the occasional wandering iguana.

For a clean, quiet sandscape with outstanding snorkeling right 
offshore, hit up Sapphire Beach. Or, nestled in a sheltered cove on 
the other side of the island, Magens Bay is great for tanning, swim-
ming and picnicking. 

Really though — I can’t say it enough: Every inch of the shoreline

me get around the city: 1) Tell your 
driver exactly where you want to go; 
2) tell him how much you’re willing to 
pay (don’t be afraid to “negotiate”) and 
3) tell him you don’t want to go shop-
ping. Though you may, in fact, want to 
peruse a marketplace or two, my third 
point is imperative to avoiding a long 
and uncomfortable conversation with 
a Nepalese tailor. It doesn’t matter how 
many “sexy beers” he gives you, it’s not 
worth spending time and money on a 
custom-fitted pinstriped suit.

When the full moon approaches 
and you’ve had your share of fear and 
loathing in Khao San, head south to 
Thailand’s tropical islands. Skip the 
bar-girl haven of Phuket and make 
your way toward Koh Phangan. Every 
full moon, travelers gather to partake 
in the word’s biggest beach party. 
Arrive a couple days early, order some 
whiskey buckets from a stand labeled 
“Brad Pitt Love Me Long Time” and 
get out before the onslaught of rav-
ers ruins your fun — the difference 
between 10,000 drunks on the beach 
and 25,000 drunks is intolerable.

After a string of parties in Koh 
Phangan, either waste time hopping 
around secluded beaches or make a 

clean break from the boozy spring-
break crowd. I recommend the latter 
— heading to the North will help you 
wiggle from the Southern Thailand’s 
Cancun-like spell, and get to know the 
country for its people and history.

For your first history lesson, stop 
at Sukhothai, a tiny village in the 
lower North known for its acres of 
ancient ruins. Embrace the commu-
nity’s relaxed way of life: Rent a bike 
to tour the national parks in the area. 
While basking in the peaceful out-
doors, keep your eyes out for Bhuddas 
scattered between lakes and trees.

Depending on how much time 
you’ve got left, you can either con-
tinue to another tiny village or head 
to Chiang Mai, the biggest city in the 
North and a proverbial middle finger 
to Bangkok’s smelly sprawl of noise 
and commerce. Chiang Mai’s known 
for its giant artisan markets and close 
proximity to jungles and waterfalls. 
Perfect your curry-making skills with 
a cheap cooking class, or go luxuri-
ous for a full-body massage from an 
institution of the blind (their extra-
sensitive touch gives them an edge). 

Consider a two-day trip to Pai 
— a little hippie town way up in the 
healthy green hilltops — for an extra 

dose of natural scenery. The village 
has few enough stoplights that you 
can count them on one hand, sur-
rounded by hot springs and warm, 
flowing waterfalls. Usually, I’d recom-
mend you stay at a hostel, but when 
visiting Pai, one must irrefutably stay 
at the Darling Viewpoint Inn. Though 
slightly infested with bugs, this elevat-
ed bungalow hotel has the best view 
of the city and the friendliest host in 
town — a cheerful native who goes by 
the name of, you guessed it, Darling.

Oddly enough, she’ll call you 
Darling, too, and load you in the 
back of her truck for a trip to the 
hot spring, where you’ll boil corn 
and bath in candelight. When you’ve 
flown the nest, you can spend your 
free time drinking mushroom shakes 
(yes, the special kind) and listening to 
lady men sing in the Pai cafes.

After that, it’s up to you. Either 
wander from village to village in 
search of something cool, head back 
to Bangkok or take a rickety old boat 
into Laos. But don’t leave without at 
least one night of too much rice whis-
key and grasshoppers — you’ll never 
find a drunk, nor insect, so delectable.

is tropical perfection, ripe for sailing, 
surfing, kayaking, windsurfing, snor-
keling, scuba diving, fishing or just 
relaxing on the shore, taking swigs of 
the spectacular view.

And what would the Caribbean be 
without rum? Whether served com-
plimentary as you step off the plane or 
in a mixed drink as you lounge pool-
side, don’t miss the warm ‘n’ fuzziest 
side of Caribbean culture, free to be 
enjoyed by everyone 18 and over. 
Cruzan Rum, distilled on the island, is 
known to be one of the best brands in 
the world, and comes in flavors rang-
ing from coconut to raspberry.

After a full day at the beach, 
a popular St. Thomas hangout is 
Duffy’s Love Shack, located right 
across the street from the St. John 
Ferry Dock. If you’re with a group, 
order the Shark Tank: A 64 oz. fish-
bowl filled with rum and liquers. 
For a taste of traditional Caribbean 
cuisine — like fried plantains, jerk 
chicken or an oatmeal dish called 
fungi — dine out at Fungi’s on the 
Beach. On Saturday night, be sure to 
visit Iggie’s for all-you-can-eat crab 
legs and (post-rum) karaoke.

The city of Charlotte Amalie 

must be visited at least once. For a 
true taste of Caribbean flair, stop at 
the open-air bazaar on the corner 
of the city and barter for everything 
from shells to printed sarongs to 
haircuts. The Pirate Museum on 
top of the hill pays tribute to the 
Caribbean’s swashbuckling past, 
while offering spectacular views of 
the cruise-ship harbor and the city. 

A few remnants of Danish colo-
nization in the 1600s linger on the 
island, including huge stone sugar 
mills hidden in lush undergrowth 
and the historic main city’s cobble-
stone streets, on which you must 
stick to the left side of the road.

St. Thomas is only a 30-minute 
flight from Florida, and since it’s 
technically part of the United States, 
no passport is needed.

niently, 18 and over. Taxis are the 
easiest way to navigate the city, 
especially for anyone looking to 
spend most of their time in Puerto 
Rico’s urban clusters. Sticking to 
San Sebastian and Calle Fortaleza is 
a surefire way to make sure you find 
the best hotspots — both of which 
are located in the northern part of 
the capital known as Old San Juan. 

Restaurants in Old San Juan 
are popular digs for tourists: Latin 
“fusion” cuisine, late-night tapas 
bars and mini Margaritavilles fea-
turing live bands. Fratelli’s is an easy 
find, on the southern end of Calle 
Fortaleza, and an even easier place 
to relax in. Serving Italian cuisine 
blended with Mediterranean and 
Puerto Rican ingredients, it also 

doubles as a bar once night sets 
in. Prices for entrees throughout 
Old San Juan range from $10 to 
$40, depending on whether you’re 
among the sandaled crowds or 
reservation-only richies.

Though beautiful beaches are old 
news for most of us, Puerto Rico’s 
warmer waters are a whole new kind 
of paradise. With more than 275 
miles of coastline, it’s not hard to 
find a good patch of sand on which 
to plop. If you’re sticking to San Juan, 
then Isla Verde is a posh stretch tex-
tured with lean palms and towering 
hotels. But if you’d rather break the 
tourist veneer, drive down the cost 
to find a secluded spot tapering off a 
rainforest or surf–eaten cliff.

The AmazonI n the Amazon, dipping your hand in the river is an act of faith that it won’t get chewed off — and snakes aren’t just 
extremely poisonous, but can be up to 14 feet 
long. If you’re up for a walk on the wild side, 
there’s no better place to be.

Choose from a weekend getaway camp at 
Lake Sandoval snf the four-hours-from-civili-
zation, only-three-hours-worth-of-antivenom 
lodges deeper along the Madre de Dios River.

Lodges like Sandoval straddle the line 
between adventure and getaway, rooming dozens 
of tourists with a bar and TVs — but you didn’t 
fly all the way to Peru so you could sit around 
and play Bullshit with other Americans: Plunk 
your ass in a motorboat and speed downriver. 

Remember that you’re going to be crammed into 
a blind with these three or four people waiting 
for macaws to gather, so make friends early.

The first walk into the Amazon will be a 
shock: Under the thin tree canopy, the Amazon 
looks like the kind of trail you’d jog back in the 
US, more brown than green, not like the verdant 
wonderland you’d find in Costa Rica.

Let your inner eight-year-old loose for the 
bugs, like metallic blue morpho butterflies and 
bullet ants (not as poisonous as the snakes, but 
after 24 hours of pain, you might wish they 
were). Anything larger than that tends to hide 
itself pretty well — don’t be amazed if the only 
mammals you see are walking-meal capybaras, 
lapping at the water in the twilight as the eyes 

of caiman crocs glow the same red as an alarm 
clock — but every tour makes a point of viewing 
the macaw parrots, all of them as brightly colored 
as skittles. Make sure your camera has a good 
zoom for the macaws, because you won’t get 
much closer than a football field.

Once you’ve gotten over the fact that every-
thing in the Amazon seems to be horribly 
dangerous and aggressive, give yourself a real 
gift: Walk the first few minutes into the rainfor-
est without a guide. Idiotic? Hell yes, but when 
you’re in the Amazon and you own that moment 
yourself, not sharing it with anyone else — well, 
that’s simply priceless.

bus out. I’d highly recommend 
the detour; although you can still 
snag some amazing pictures of Mt. 
McKinley from the road, it’s not the 
same as heading off on your own.

Just make sure to have a back-up 
plan in the likely event that you come 
across some bears or caribou. Denali 
is all open wilderness — our country’s 
least-developed national park, posi-
tively brimming with unique flora 
and fauna. Alaska’s summertime sun-
light starts early in the morning and 
lasts for 19 hours, so there’ll be plenty 
of time to get back out of the park, 
drop your stuff off at your hostel and 
head over to the nearest bar to com-

you’ll have an e-mail within seconds.
When it comes down to it, being 

an au pair is beyond awesome. As 
long as you take your time to choose 
the right family, you’ll end up with 
one that’s perfect for you. (Skype 
interviews are invaluable, even if 
they’re a little awkward, and mostly 
involve waving at cute four-year-olds 
that don’t quite understand who the 
face on the computer is.) Once you’re 
there, just say ‘Yes’ to everything, and 
you’re practically guaranteed a good 
time. If a French passerby offers you 
“muscadet” or a Londoner proposes a 
trip to a gay bar, go for it (just don’t try 
the margaritas — that seems to be an 
Americas-only concept).

Once you’ve arrived, your first 
challenge is to earn the adoration of 
your kids. Disney is a universal pass-
port to said adoration. Use it early; use 

it often. Admit you know the whole 
plot of “Aladdin” to memory, and the 
kids will accept you wholeheartedly 
into every princess/prince-themed 
game under the sun. 

Days off are the greatest thing 
that can happen, mostly because 
they give you a chance to explore the 
world you’ve thrown yourself into. 
Get your family’s advice on some 
must-see attractions and then set off 
for the unknown, armed with a map 
and some rudimentary subject-verb 
knowledge. Have conversations with 
random locals, sit at a cafe, ask people 
for directions to museums you’ve 
apparently walked past 20 times 
already — you have the whole sum-
mer to figure out the basics, and you 
shouldn’t pass up a croissant-munch-
ing football-watching moment of it.

I f you’re searching for an all-inclusive break that won’t involve much thought or travel time, look no further than the port of San Diego. Taking a three- to five-day Carnival Cruise to Mexico will 
make all dreams of cheap boozing, random hookups and constant 
grubbing come true.

There’s no time like the present to take advantage of an economy 
that’s gone to shit. After you sell last quarter’s textbooks, you can hop 
on a Carnival Cruise ship for as little as $199.

Unlike most ocean liners, Carnival Cruises weren’t designed for 
those teetering between retirement and death. With a focus on clients 
35 and under, Carnival is the only cruise line that allows 18-year-olds 
to drink onboard (in international waters, of course).

But if you don’t want to fork out $9 for on-board cocktails, Mexico 
is a good place to buy brand-name alcohol for half of what you’d pay 
stateside. As high-school as it sounds, bring extra water bottles to 
fill with your international purchase — while the cruise line doesn’t 
mind you paying through the nose for their drinks, they’re not too 
keen on co-eds getting wasted off the $12 Absolut they bought at a 
Mexican drugstore.

Drugs, sex and rock ‘n’ roll aside, the best part of the trip is an 
utter lack of responsibility or purpose. There’s nothing better than 
waking up in the morning and leaving the mess you can’t quite recall 
making to the ship’s cleaning staff while you devour a four-course 
breakfast.

Technically, you’re supposed to be at least 21 to cruise alone; 
however, if you can find someone who is 21 to register with you, you 
won’t have a problem getting aboard.

So leave the worry of finding a designated driver on the boarding 
platform — you definitely don’t want to miss the boat on this one.

spring break

C osta Rica is renowned for its lazy pace, winding beach-es and dependable surf. Compared to neighboring Central American destinations it’s known for its stabil-
ity and tourist-friendly attitude. But with roads that have more 
potholes than tarmac, Costa Rica gives you the best of both 
worlds: a pristine resort off the beaten path.

Most flights will land you smack-dab in the middle of 
the congested capital of San Jose, where taxis tear through the streets and locals push grocery carts full of fresh 
oranges, waiting and ready to be squeezed straight into your cup. Most visitors high-tail it out of San Jose as soon 
as the plane comes to a stop, but if you give it a chance, the city comes through. Get your souvenir shopping out 
of the way in its curio shops, stacked with beach-themed trinkets. Or, if your goal is to get your bronze on, gear 
up for the chaotic central bus station, and ride a couple hours to either the Pacific or Caribbean coasts. 

The first stop along the Pacific is Jaco, a dirty beach town typically utilized as a weekend getaway from San 
Jose. If you’re willing to put in a little more bus time, however, the beaches get exponentially better. To the north 
lies Nicoya Peninsula and the surf town of Tamarindo, or the more upscale Moctezuma, which offers day trips 
to the Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve. If you’re the wildlife type, head south to Manuel Antonio. Mind your bag: 
monkeys have been known to unzip backpacks and snag unsuspecting snacks. 

The rasta vibe seeps into everything on the Caribbean coast, from coconut drinks to green-, yellow- and red-
painted mini-marts. Head over to Lima for an umbrella drink in a hammock and a chance to watch the sun rise 
over the calm, rolling waves. You can also bus up to Tortuguero National Park on the northern Caribbean coast, 
where a guided night stroll along the beach to find the famous Leatherback turtle will bring you nose to nose 
with a beautiful three- to six-foot giant.

CREW — It seemed like nothing could stop 
the UCSD men’s crew team from continu-
ing its domination of the San Diego City 
Championships on Feb. 27 — until Mother 
Nature had her say. 

Early Saturday morning, a magnitude-8.8 
earthquake hit the coast of Chile, sending 
shock waves up the coast of North and South 
America, and tsunami warnings as far north as 
Alaska and as far west as Japan and Russia. Due 
to the high chance of strong waves streaking 
across the coast, the men’s and women’s crew 
San Diego city championships — which were 
scheduled to take place in Mission Bay — will 
be rescheduled later this week.

The UCSD men’s team has won the inaugu-
ral race of the season for the past five consecu-
tive years, and — even with a young cast — was 
banking on winning it this year too.

“For the past three of five years, this event 
has been canceled or rescheduled for some 
reason,” men’s head coach Zach Johnson said. 
“This wasn’t a big deal for some of the seniors 
on our team who have already seen a few city 
championships canceled.”

The league race was also to be the first of 
the season for the women, who were hoping to 
let their young team rack up some experience 
at the event.

Both the men’s and women’s teams are filled 

with young, inexperienced racers anxious to get 
the season started, but they may now have to 
squeeze two events into one week — depending 
on when the race will be made up.

“We’re not sure when this race is going to 
get rescheduled to,” Johnson said. “We have 
all of our weekends booked through the end 
of the season, so unless we want to schedule it 
midweek, we’ll have to schedule it for the end 
of the year.”

Typically, the season’s opening race does not 
happen until April, but because the Tritons will 
partake in the George Washington Invitational 
in early April, the coaches in San Diego sched-
uled the annual city championships for this 
weekend. 

“We usually start the season later, but we 
had a great opportunity to go to a big meet,” 
Johnson said. “So the coaches in this area 
scheduled the meet now — but now, we’ll 
have to work something else, because we will 
see them next weekend at the UC San Diego 
Regatta race.”

In light of the cancellation, Johnson said the 
team was able to hold invaluable practice on 
rowing machines — something they had been 
unable to do yet this season.

Despite the delay, the Tritons will get back 
in the water next weekend at the UCSD Regatta 
race in Mission Bay.

said she is looking for the same consistency in 
postseason play.

“Our four seniors have given so much to this 
program,” Elliott said. “Noonan and Ilg have 
given the last four years to this team, and I can’t 
say enough about their commitment, work ethic 
and impact on this team. Leilani Martin and 
Kristen Cabral have made an incredible impact 
and contribution to this program in their two 
short years. They have bought into our system 
and have given their hearts and souls to make 
this team better.”

All four seniors played in every game this 
season, contributing an average of nearly 24 
points per game.

“All four of them will be tremendously 
missed,” Elliott said. “It will be a sad day when 
we have to say good bye to them ... so we 
are going to try to put that off for as long as 
possible.”

The Tritons will begin tournament play by 
hosting Cal State Dominguez Hills on March 2 
at RIMAC arena, hitting the floor at 7 p.m.

UCSD SCORES ROAD UPSET AT UCLA 
By Jessy Jahangir
Staff Writer

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The No. 14 
UCSD men’s volleyball team rolled 
into UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 
24 facing a heavily favored Bruin 
team.

But despite the odds, the Tritons 
upset No. 3 UCLA 30-22, 30-25, 
30-26, in a three-set stretch on Feb. 
24. This was the third Triton victory 
over the Bruins in the past three years 
— and in 38 all-time meetings. With 
the win, UCSD improved 5-11 overall, 
and 2-9 in Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, while UCLA dropped 9-7 
overall and 8-5 in the MPSF. Prior to 
the match, the Bruins had won eight 
of their last 10 matches. 

As soon as they hit the court, the 
Tritons took the lead and held on until 
the end of the first set. UCSD hit at 
.567 with 22 kills, compared to the 
Bruins’ 11 kills, and won the set 30-22.

In the second set, there were 12 ties 
and seven lead changes. The Bruins 
took their final lead in the set at 
15-14. UCSD fought back with junior 
outside hitter 
Joel Davidson’s 
kill and took 
the lead on a 
UCLA setting 
error. With the 
score at 25-23, 
a UCLA service 
error and a kill 
from senior out-
side hitter Frank 
Fritsch brought 
up UCSD’s lead 
by two points. 
A Bruin side 
out, another kill 
from Fritsch 
and an ace by 
senior setter Erik 
Sierks helped the 
Tritons take the 
set 30-25.

The third set was closely fought 
with 23 ties and six lead changes. 
UCSD outhit UCLA .405 to .184; 
however, the Bruins still managed 
to make it a difficult set. They were 
narrowly edging past the Tritons 
by one point until UCSD delivered 
three consecutive kills via redshirt 
freshman middle blocker Cyrus 
Kiani, senior setter Phil Bannan and 
Davidson, clinching a 27-25 lead. 
Despite a service error that narrowed 
the Triton lead to 27-26, a final push 
from UCSD — including a kill from 
Fritsch and a block by Kiani — gave 
them a match point. A UCLA attack 
error gifted UCSD the final point to 
finish the set 30-26.

UCSD hit at a .427 overall attack 
average. Fritsch led the Tritons with 
16 kills and a .419 hitting average. 
Davidson contributed 12 kills. Senior 
outside hitter Jason Spangler also con-
tributed two service aces, increasing 
his career total to 78 — just two aces 
short of tying the all-time record of 
career-aces at UCSD.

“We got off to a great start. We 
played steady, and knew UCLA  would 

come back,” 
head coach 
Kevin Ring said. 
“For us, it was 
a really a com-
plete game. We 
did everything 
well.”

On Friday 
night, the 
Tritons trav-
eled to Irvine 
to square off 
against No. 
11 UC Irvine. 
Unfortunately, 
UCSD took too 
long to find 
its pace in the 
match and lost 
in four sets to 
Irvine 30-15, 

30-25, 29-31 and 30-23. The loss 
dropped the Tritons to 5-12 overall, 
and 2-10 in MPSF, while the Anteaters 
improved to 9-9 overall, and 5-8 in 
MPSF.

UCSD only had nine kills against 
11 attack errors in the first set. The 
second set was unfortunately not 
much better, with the Tritons hitting 
at .077.

The Tritons improved in the third 
set, hitting percentage of .417 and 
a tally of 24 kills — more than the 
first two sets combined. Nonetheless,  
the Anteaters took a quick 15-9 lead. 
UCSD fought hard to make amends 
and narrowed UC Irvine’s lead to 
26-23. Junior Adrian Guthals’ kill and 
block, as well as a block by Bannan, 
tied the set at 26-26. After exchang-
ing a series of points, Davidson sent 
consecutive kills to give the Tritons a 
31-29 set victory.

The Anteaters took a quick 4-1 
lead in the fourth set. The Tritons 
managed to come back at 13-12 until 
the Anteaters rallied, scoring seven of 
the next nine points to take its lead to 
20-14. Unfortunately, this disparity 
was too much for the Tritons to close, 
and the closest UCSD got to victory 
was 24-21. Ultimately, the Anteaters 
took the set 30-23.

In the first two sets, the Tritons 
were hitting below .100. Davidson 
contributed a team-high 19 kills, 
Spangler had 14 kills, Guthals con-
tributed seven kills and Fritsch added 
six kills. Bannan contributed 47 assists 
and 15 digs.

The Tritons return to action on 
Friday, March 5, when they travel to 
Palo Alto to face Stanford at 7 p.m.

“We didn’t pass well against 
Irvine,” Ring said. “So we’ll practice 
that before we head to Stanford. We 
know what we need to do in order to 
do well, so we’ll be focusing on that.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
men’s basketball team finished its sea-
son on Feb. 26 at its senior night game 
against Humboldt State University — 
the final collegiate game for senior 
players Jordan Lawley and Tyler 
Acevedo. 

But despite the occasion, the 
Tritons were unable to 
translate emotion into 
execution, and lost 87-79 
to the Lumberjacks just 
two days after a 70-57 loss 
to Sonoma State.

The team had high 
hopes of sending its 
senior players, who were 
playing their last game in 
Triton colors, off with a 
win. Senior guard Tyler 
Acevedo and sophomore 
center Christian Hatch 
scored a combined 34 
points, supported by 
junior guard Casey Ryan’s 
eight points off the bench. 
Senior guard and team 
scoring average leader 
Jordan Lawley finished with 14 
points.

The Tritons were within four 
points of a tie with less than three 
minutes left, but Humboldt State 
forward Kevin Atkins led the 
Lumberjacks to a regular season-
ending win by scoring a game-high 
31 points and pulling down nine 
rebounds.

On Wednesday, Sonoma State 
took a commanding lead at the end 
of the first half and held onto it for 
the rest of the game. 

Despite a strong performance 
from sophomore guard Bryce Alvari, 
who went 6-6 from the free-throw 

line with six points, and Hatch, who 
went 4-9 from the field with eight 
points, the Tritons could not keep up 
with the Seawolves.

Head coach Chris Carlson says 
he is looking to rebuild his team to 
improve upon the progress made by 
this years team.

But for Lawley and Acevedo, there 
won’t be a next season. 

“I tried to hold onto every 
moment,” Lawley said. “I 
feel blessed that I was 
able to play four years on 
the basketball team, and I 
don’t take it for granted. I 
was glad to be able to be 
a part of the team.”

Acevedo said that 
emotions ran high in 
the locker room after 
Friday’s game. 

“Student athletes 
create bonds that will be 
lifelong,” Acevedo said.

Though Lawley and 
Acevedo must now 
move on to lives beyond 
basketball, both players 
said that being a part 
of UCSD Athletics has 

changed their lives in positive ways.
Acevedo said being a student 

athlete instilled in him a management 
ethic that transcends just the sport.

“[Athletics] gave me more 
responsibility and time management 
skills to help me get by with my 
schoolwork,” Acevedo said.

The Triton basketball team will 
now enter the off-season looking to 
improve on their 2009-10 season. 
They finished with an 8-17 overall 
record and 7-15 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD seniors finished 
their final season in style at their game against Humboldt 
State on Feb. 26, finally avenging the early season loss that 
had cut short their perfect 14-0 season start.

The Tritons turned in a crushing 86-51 victory over 
Humboldt State. Sophomore guard Chelsea Carlisle made 
29 points and seven assists, while junior forward Tiffany 
Hunter added 13 points and seven 
rebounds.

The victory marked the last regular-
season game for the Triton seniors — 
forward Erin Noonan, forward Kristen 
Cabral, guard Leilani Martin and guard 
Annette Ilg — who were honored 
before the game.  

“It meant so much to beat 
Humboldt, because we got a second 
chance to show them what we’re made 
of,” Noonan said.

Thanks to the win, the Tritons 
clinched sole possession of their second 
consecutive California Collegiate 
Athletic Association championship, 
having taken once step closer to the 
title with a win over Sonoma State on 
Feb. 24.

“It was a fantastic night last night 
for UCSD women’s basketball,” head 

coach Charity Elliott said. “Not only did we avenge the loss 
earlier in the year to Humboldt, but we sent off our seniors 
in remarkable fashion.”

The Tritons started the game slowly, struggling with 
Humboldt’s full court pressure, falling behind 10-15 at the 
midpoint of the first half.

However, Carlisle woke up the Triton offense by scoring 
nine straight points in a 19-4 run. UCSD went on to 
outscore Humboldt 32-15 for the rest of the half, carrying a 
commanding 18-point lead into the break. 

The Tritons opened the second half 
with a 21-9 run and went on to rout the 
Lumberjacks, extending their lead to as 
much as 37 points. 

The loss dropped Humboldt to 16-
10 overall and 14-8 in the CCAA. The 
Lumberjacks earned the fourth seed in 
the CCAA postseason tournament, and 
will play against Cal State Monterey Bay 
in the first round.

The Tritons walked onto the court 
Saturday night having already won a 
share of the title 68-52 against Sonoma 
State on Feb. 24. Carlisle once again led 
the way with 11 points and 8 assists, 
while 11 of the players racked up points 
for UCSD.

The Tritons never trailed, en route 
to a comfortable victory. The loss 
dropped Sonoma to 8-13 in league play 
and denied the Seawolves a chance to 

play in the postseason.
UCSD wrapped up the regular season with a 24-3  

overall record, including 19-3 in conference play. With 
their conference title, the Tritons earned the top seed 
in the CCAA tournament, and will face No. 8 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Tuesday.

Noonan said the Tritons are wary of an upset, after 
falling in the first round of last year’s tournament with a 
tough loss to Cal State San Bernardino. 

“I think these tournament games are more significant to 
the seniors because these are games we don’t get back, and 
there is no next time,” Noonan said. “We don’t get another 
year. It’s now or never for us, and we’re looking to make it 
happen.”

Of the four seniors, Noonan and Ilg have been regular 
starters for the Tritons, while Martin and Cabral have 
been frequent contributors from the bench. Coach Elliott 
had nothing but glowing praise for her team leaders, and
