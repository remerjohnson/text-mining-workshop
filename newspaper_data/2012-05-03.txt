SURF REPORT

I had to do what I 
had to do to survive.”

AUCSD student who was left in a Drug Enforcement Administration cell for five days without food, 
water or human contact is plan-
ning to file suit against the agency.  
       Engineering student Daniel 
Chong, along with eight others, was 

taken to the DEA 
Kearny Mesa head-
quarters on April 
21, following a raid 
on a house where he 
and the others were 

allegedly smoking marijuana. 
Chong resorted to drinking urine 

during his stay in the 5-foot by 

10-foot cell.
“I had to 

recycle my own 
urine,” Chong 
said in an inter-
view with the 
U-T San Diego. 
“I had to do 
what I had to do 
to survive.”

While at 
headquarters, DEA agents made 
seven arrests, but officers purport-
edly told Chong that he would not 
be charged.

Chong was then left in his cell 
for five days until two DEA agents 

found him on April 25. The DEA 
paid for Chong’s hospital stay, where 
he was treated for kidney failure, 
cramps, dehydration and a perforated 
esophagus.

While in solitary confinement, 
Chong attempted to take his own 
life by breaking his eyeglasses and 
attempting to cut his wrists. He also 
tried unsuccessfully to carve the 
words “Sorry Mom” into his arm.

“I hallucinated by the third day,” 
Chong said during a press conference 
on May 1. “I was completely insane.”

Chong had also ingested a white 
powdery substance that he found in 
the cell. The substance was later iden-

tified as methamphetamine.
Chong also said that he could 

hear agents walking in the hallways 
and in adjacent cells but no one 
responded to his screaming or cries 
for help.

On Wednesday, DEA spokesman 
William R. Sherman apologized to 
Chong for the entrapment.

“I am deeply troubled by the inci-
dent that occurred here last week,” 
Sherman said in the statement. “I 
have personally ordered an extensive 
review of our policies and proce-
dures.”

California Senator Barbara Boxer 
echoed the call for investigation in 

a letter she wrote to United States 
Attorney General Eric Holder ask-
ing for a thorough review of the 
incident.

At UCSD, A.S. Council passed a 
resolution on May 2 denouncing the 
DEA for Chong’s detention and urg-
ing Chancellor Fox to take a stance 
on the issue.

Chong’s attorney Eugene Iredale 
said that they intend to file a claim 
against the federal government. If 
the claim is denied, they will file a 
federal lawsuit.

Concerns 
Over New 
Conduct 
Code

BY EMILY PHAM
Contributing Writer

The new Student Conduct Code, 
which standardizes the disciplinary 
process for all colleges, will be imple-
mented beginning Fall 2012. Members 
of A.S. Council, after working with 
UCSD administration to write the 
code, are concerned with vague word-
ing in the revision that may restrict 
students’ rights if left unchecked.

“I am, and A.S. as a whole is, very 
concerned about a number of things 
in the newest draft [of the code],” 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Bryce Farrington said in 
an email. “The vagueness [allows] the 

A.S. COUNCIL

BY KASHI KHORASANI
Staff Writer

Each A.S. senator is required to 
do two projects per academic year 
as part of his or her duties. A.S. 
senators are elected officials, except 
in cases when they are appointed to 
fill a vacancy.

In order to write an update on 
these projects, the Guardian repeat-
edly contacted the following cam-
puswide senators: Karen Liang, 
Carlos Molina, Amanda Malamud, 
Kirk Freeman, Ashton Cohen, 
Brad Segal, Matt Bradbury and 
Clinton Rodriguez. Of these, Brad 
Segal, Matt Bradbury and Clinton 
Rodriguez responded regarding 
their projects. 

Brad Segal stepped into his role 
as campuswide senator on March 
14, after the resignation of former 
senator Annie Yu. Segal said that 
he received funding for his sena-
tor project the same night he was 
appointed into his position.

A tax passed by the UC Board 
of Regents may cause student fees to 
go toward funding the UC Office of 
the President. The Regents passed the 
tax, known as the Funding Stream 
Initiative, in July 2011 with the goal of 
increasing financial transparency.

Before, revenue generated by each 
campus went through UCOP, which 
took a 6-percent share and redistrib-
uted the funds back to the campuses.  
This revenue came from Core 
Funds, which includes sources 
such as medical centers and grants 
and contracts, but did not include  
campus-based fees, such as sports fees 
and college activity fees. 

Now, revenues will remain on the 
campuses they originate from,  and 
UCOP will gain funds through a 
1.69-percent flat tax of all campuses.

The chancellors and vice chan-
cellors of the universities can choose 
when to implement the tax and how 

much to draw from each funding 
source to meet the total 1.69 percent. 
Student fees may be included as a 
funding source.

“The impact on campuses 
will vary from one to another 
because they don’t have exactly 
the same revenue sources,” UCOP 
spokesperson Shelly Meron wrote in 
an email. “For example, some UCs 
have medical centers, some have less 
research, some have more professional 
schools, etc. All of that affects campus-
level revenues, and by extension affects 
what funds will be assessed and what 
impact this will have.”

The chancellors of UC Riverside 
and UC Santa Barbara have already 
instituted the tax, with Riverside pay-
ing 2 percent of its overall revenue. 
UC Santa Barbara Student Affairs 
now owes $700,000 to UCOP, lead-
ing UCSB Student Affairs to ask the 
student council to pay anywhere from 
$99,000 to $180,000. UCSB’s coun-
cil has frozen student org funds until 
further notice. The Davis A.S. council 
faces an estimated $250,000 reduction 
to its annual budget.

The A.S. Councils of UC Riverside 
and UC Merced have passed reso-
lutions criticizing the inclusion of 
student-initiated fees in the Funding 
Streams Initiative. 

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Sammy Chang 

brought up the new tax at council’s 
April 25 meeting. 

“Action must be taken or there will 
be fiscal disaster,” Chang said during 
his April 25 presentation to council.

According to Chang, the tax will go 
into effect at UCSD starting Fall 2012.  
The tax did not affect UCSD this year 
because the university’s annual budget 
was set by the time the UC Regents 
passed the tax. 

Chang added that council plans to 
inform students about the tax and peti-
tion Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue to ask her not to include 
student fee funds in the tax. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has 
voiced support for the tax, but has also 
proposed some alterations — such as 
a reduction in the 1.69-percent total 
taxation rate.

UCOP hopes that this will eventu-
ally reduce fees for students, even if 
they have an increased financial bur-
den in the present.

“I believe the outcome of the 
Financial Streams Initiative will 
enhance transparency and will help 
set the 10 campuses on a path towards 
continued excellence in the coming 
years,” UC President Mark Yudof said 
in a Sept. 12 memo addressed to UC 
chancellors and budgeting staff.

Staff Writer

Nearly 80 percent of San Diego 
County students drive while distract-
ed, researchers at UCSD’s Trauma 
Epidemiology and Injury Prevention 
Research center announced last 
Tuesday at a UCSD Medical Center 
press conference.

According to the CDC, distracted 
driving has three main components: 
visual, manual and cognitive. Visual 
distraction consists of a driver taking 
his eyes off the road, manual distrac-
tion occurs when a driver takes his 
hands off the wheel and cognitive 
distraction consists of a driver taking 
his mind off the task of driving.

Distracted driving can take many 
forms: talking on the phone is a well-
known example of dangerous driving 
behavior, but the UCSD study found 
that texting is far more risky. While 
talking on the phone while driving 
increased the crash rate around four 
times, texting while driving increased 
the crash rate 16 to 32 times.

In a recent press release, Linda 
Hill said that the study found that 
“distracted driving has become an 
accepted behavior” in spite of the 
known risks.

For the study, researchers distrib-
uted questions to randomly selected 
students in the form of an anony-
mous Internet survey. Five thousand 
students were chosen for the study 
from nine colleges throughout San 
Diego County. The mean age of study 
participants was 21. Two-thirds of the 
students selected were female, and 
most were undergraduates.

Of the 78 percent who admitted to 
engaging in some kind of distracted 
behavior while driving, half said they 
texted while driving on the freeway, 
and 87 percent said they had sent 
texts while idling at red lights.

Hill said that distracted driving 
has become extremely prevalent. 

“The people who observed others 
driving distracted were more likely to 
drive distracted themselves,” Hill said.

She stated in a press release that 
college students have “misplaced con-

fidence in their own driving skills and 
their ability to multitask.”

In an interview with the San Diego 
radio station KPBS, Hill said distract-
ed driving at full speed on a freeway 
is a dangerous because there are long 
distances traveled in short periods of 
time. Taking your eyes off the road 
to text, a process which takes 3 to 5 
seconds, is enough time to travel “the 
length of a football field.” In that time 
period, Hill said, “it’s as if you’re driv-
ing with your eyes shut.”

The survey asked students what 
it would take for them to drive more 
safely. Students named several pun-
ishments that, if implemented, would 
deter them from driving distracted. 
These include: removing insurance 
coverage for crashes caused by dis-
tracted driving, giving drivers a point 
on their driving record for their first 
distracted driving citation, and cre-
ating a $350 fine for first-time dis-
tracted driving.

Segal was recently re-elected as a 
campuswide senator for the 2012-13 
academic year.

For his senator project, Matt 
Bradbury focused on the formation 
and growth of voter registration org 
Student Voter Access Committee, 
which was started last year by 
SOVAC Executive Director Arshya 

Sharifian. Bradbury has integrat-
ed SOVAC into the Associated 
Students, enabling the organization 
to work during freshmen move-
in weekend and register 1,700 new 
voters. 

Bradbury said that he is cur-
rently working on the internal ref-
ormation of A.S. Council, specifi-
cally by adding more committees to 
increase council’s division of labor 
and specialization. Bradbury also 
played a large role in A.S. Council’s 
election code revisions, which were 
completed and implemented during 
Fall Quarter 2011.

Clinton Rodriguez worked on 

freshmen senator recruitment by 
attending Marshall, Muir and Revelle 
College orientations and staying 
active on the official 2015 page for 
incoming students to advertise for 
the three open council positions. 

Rodriguez also partnered 
with the Inter-Fraternity Council 
to create a tailgate for Greeks, 
with the assistance of Associate 
Vice President of Enterprise and 
Operations Brian McEuen and 
Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Relations Aurora Lopez.

ability [for administration] to suspend 
someone in the interim, without trial 
or due process, for simply ‘disruptive 
activity with the orderly operation of 
the campus.’”

According to Farrington, the new-
est draft of the code allows student 
organizations to be suspended by 
administration without going through 
the lengthy process that the current 
code requires. It leaves the interpreta-
tion of “disorderly or lewd conduct” 
open, which would allow administra-
tion to generalize anything it consid-
ered disorderly as a violation under 
that jurisdiction. 

The existing code has the advan-
tage of being specific and concise 
compared to the new code, Farrington 
said. The existing code defines disor-
derly conduct as “unauthorized gam-
bling, loud and unreasonable noise 
that serves no legitimate purpose...
or conduct that creates a hazardous 
condition.” 

“[The new code] is meant to be 
easier to read, but there are a lot of 
advantages with the specificity and 

complication of the current code,” 
Farrington said. “It might be more 
legalese, but that can actually protect 
students more. Student organizations 
can be suspended by administration 
without going through the whole pro-
cess.”

Parts of the code breach stu-
dent organizations’ right to the First 
Amendment, Public Education 
Coalition member Sean Estelle 
claimed.

“I think [the code has] extremely 
vague, problematic language.” Estelle 
said in a Facebook message. “It basi-
cally gives the administration carte 
blanche to arrest folks, especially those 
engaged in civil disobedience.”

Under the existing disciplinary 
process, students who receive a viola-
tion report first meet with their college 
dean to discuss the charges. During 
this meeting, they can either accept or 
challenge the charges. 

Those who choose to challenge the 
charge will attend a formal hearing in 
front of their college’s judicial board or 
an administrator not involved in the 
case, who will then decide if they are 
responsible for the violation. 

The new code, however, will create 
a campuswide community standards 
board and peer review boards for each 
of the six colleges. Thse boards will 
decide whether a student is guilty 
of misconduct. The community stan-
dards board will consist of under-
graduates, graduate students and staff, 
while the peer board will consist of 
members from its respective college.

“This is a huge process that took 
years,” Farrington said. “It’s a com-
pletely new code.”

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue first began the three-year 
process to change the code in 2009. 
Farrington said that administrators 
and staff will release a third draft of 
the code next week that will clarify the 
definition of a ‘disruption’ sometime 
next week. 

Afterwards, the draft will be sent 
to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox for 
approval. 

Director of Student Conduct Ben 
White could not be reached for com-
ment as of press time.

This week, A.S. Council unani-mously passed a resolution (proposed by a member of 
the public) denouncing the Drug 
Enforcement Administration for its 
treatment of egi-
neering student 
Daniel Chong. 
The DEA left 
Chong in a drug 
holding cell for 
five days without 
food or water.  
       A.S. Advocate 
General Courtney Hill brought leg-
islation to impeach senators Ashton 
Cohen, Amanda Malamud, Kevin 
Fish, Clinton Rodriguez and Cyrus 
Kiani. But after further review, council 
decided that five senators would not be 
impeached because their outstanding 
absences were the result of clerical error. 
      General Store Co-operative mem-
ber Tauri St. Claire said that the 
General Store has made big strides in 
paying back the debts it accrued dur-
ing a down period from 2007-09. Since 
2009, the General Store has paid back 
$20,000 in debt, back taxes and penal-
ties, she said.

“Consider the General Store as 
being under new management,” St. 
Claire said.

Council cheered ERC Senator 
Jackie Clavin when she announced 
that safety whistles engraved with the 
UCSD logo and walk number had 
arrived.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Bryce Farrington told the 
council that the Know Your Rights 
Campaign will be held Week Seven. 
The campaign will go into detail about 
how to handle encounters with the 
police, among other things.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Services Leigh Mason reported that 
A.S. Safe rides signed up 131 students 

at last week’s Bear Garden. She also 
told the council that Safe Rides is cur-
rently exploring the feasibility of single 
sign-ons for Safe Rides.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
announced that the 
re-filming of the AS 
UCSD Lip Dub will 
be held on Sunday 
and would be open 
to all who showed 
up.

“This is a project 
that is honestly larger 

than ourselves, larger than our com-
mittee,” Wing said. “People that were 
there the first time around can attest 
that there was a community building 
through this project.”

Sixth College Senator Cody 
Marshall told the council that the 
Chocolate Festival is this Friday, May 
4. 

Two members of the council — 
Campuswide Senators Karen Liang 
and Matt Bradbury — were honored 
as Councilmembers of the Week.

Interim Associate Vice President 
of Academics Samuel Chang and 
Marshall Senator Bryan Cassella gave 
a presentation on behalf of the Office 
of Finance. They called to attention 
the lack of financial transparency at 
UCSD, citing that 21 percent of the 
expenditures are labeled other with no 
further clarification.

“We need to know where every-
thing in the budget goes, if we don’t 
know, we’re going to be stuck footing 
the bill, because people will say ‘oh the 
students can pay for this,’” Chang said.

Revelle Senator Caeser Feng and 
Chang created a presentation about 
changes that could streamline the 
selection process of associate vice pres-
idents and make the selection more 
accountable. Later, council passed the 
resolution.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 3,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY ASHTON SHAHYAD COHEN
A.S. Campuswide Senator

In high school I started a Jewish-
Muslim United club and engaged 
in numerous activities to create 
an environment of mutual respect 
for both cultures.  Based on recent 
disturbing incidents on our campus, 
I see a great need for similar efforts 
to engage these ethnic and religious 
groups in sensitivity and civility 
training and require its leaders to 
participate in respectful dialogue.

Last week, the Guardian reported 
on an insidious and libelous claim 
regarding a picture involving me 
wearing a traditional Middle Eastern 
outfit purchased during my travels 
in Dubai.  The picture was taken and 
posted on Facebook by a Muslim 
female friend who was stunned 
that I received verbal attacks, even 
accusations of racism, as a result of 
the photo.  As someone of Middle 
Eastern descent and committed to 
interfaith relations, I apologize if the 
photo caused offense.

Though I understand the photo 
could be misinterpreted, I feel the 
attacks were politically motivated 

since I am Jewish, serve on A.S. 
Council and voted against the recent 
resolution to divest from companies 
which provide war technology used 
by the Israeli Defense Forces.  The 
individuals who verbally attacked 
me referenced my “actions,” or 
vote during divestment, in their 
accusations and appear to be 
motivated to tarnish my reputation 
and silence my voice.

This attack echoes last month’s 
intimidation tactics and false 
accusations by the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee, who sent a 
letter to the administration accusing 
Professor Shlomo Dubnov, who spoke 
publically against divestment, of 
racist rhetoric and verbally attacking 
a pro-divestment student.  Last week, 
the UCSD Office of Prevention of 
Harassment and Discrimination  
completed an investigation clearing 
Dubnov of the allegations, but did 
not ask the student who accused 
him, or the Faculty Association 
which attacked him on their website, 
to apologize. Why not? When will 
these methods of intimidation end 
and when will our Principles of 
Community be embraced?

Personally, I find disturbing  
the events of two weeks ago, when 
Students for Justice in Palestine 
held a “Mock Israeli Checkpoint,” 
where students dressed up as Israeli 
soldiers frisked other participating 
students, culminating their theatrics 
by shouting “Intifada,” (the violent 
Palestinian uprisings against Israel).  
As a Jew, as someone who has family 
in Israel and knows people who have 
died in suicide bombings in which 
these check points were created to 
stop, I find this to be deeply offensive. 
Like Amal Dalmar said, “If we as a 
student body don’t react to events like 
this, anybody’s culture can be mocked 
and ridiculed.”

On March 8, UC President Mark 
Yudof issued a statement proclaiming  
“the moral imperative for all UC 
students, faculty and staff  to foster 
a climate of tolerance, civility and 
open-mindedness.” He said attacks 
that are meant to silence or intimidate 
those who would express differing 
opinions is not acceptable.  I agree 
with President Yudof and am worried 
about degradation of civil discourse 
and the increasing harassment and 
intimidation of pro-Israel and Jewish 

students and faculty.
Last week, UCSD reached an 

agreement with Department of Justice 
and Education to address issues of 
harassment and discrimination. 
Our administration should note the 
Department of Education’s Office 
for Civil Rights declared in 2010 that 
Jewish students are now also protected 
from harassment and discrimination 
under Title VI.

 Now is the time for our 
administration to take action to foster 
an environment of acceptance and 
create programs of civility, diversity 
and dialogue training that student 
leaders are required to attend.

I am optimistic that UCSD 
students can engage with one another 
and create a climate where people 
can express their viewpoints without 
being insulted, harassed or threatened. 
Last Friday, I met with fellow student 
senator Ruba Akel. Although she and 
I initially had different perspectives, 
we came to understand each other’s 
viewpoints and had a very engaging 
and productive conversation. We must 
all maintain a firm commitment  to 
engage in respectful dialogue and put 
our cultural differences aside.

Students Should Work Toward Fostering Climate of  Mutual Respect
GUEST COMMENTARY

A curious case has recently come out of our very own San Diego county in the past 
week. Daniel Chong, a 24-year-old 
engineering student from UCSD has 
stepped forward, alleging that he was 

locked in cramped Drug Enforcement 
Agency cell after a drug bust. For 
five straight days, Chong was given 
no food or water, and was forced to, 
in his own words to the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, “recycle his own 
urine.” 

After reaching a hallucinatory 
state by day three, Chong ingested 
a white powder that he found in his 
cramped, windowless cell, which 
turned out to be a methamphetamine. 
And in an act of desperation, he 
smashed his eyeglasses, using some 
shards to carve an apology to his 
mother on his left arm. The rest of 
the shards, according to the medical 
personnel who retrieved him five 
days later, he swallowed. 

If the federal court system is 
at all just, Chong will receive a fat 
amount of cash from the DEA for 
his ordeal. According to Chong and 
his lawyer, they are planning on 
filing a claim with the federal court 
system this week. Because though 
the circumstances of his arrest were 
legal, Chong’s subsequent detention 
and Abu Ghraib-like situation are 
certainly not. 

Chong was one of nine people 
detained on college’s favorite day, 420. 
The DEA drug bust revealed 18,000 
ecstasy pills, weed, shrooms and 
weapons. And according to Chong, 
it wasn’t his house, and those drugs 
weren’t his property. 

All the same, the nine were 
rounded up and taken to the 
DEA center in Kearny Mesa for 
questioning. After Chong was 
interrogated, the DEA agents told 
him he was at the wrong place at the 
wrong time, didn’t press criminal 
charges and offered to drive him 
home. Instead, they placed him in 
a 5-by-10 windowless holding cell. 
The other eight were questioned, and 
released, while Chong reached a near-
death state, screaming for help and 
kicking the door in a fruitless attempt 
to rouse the attention of the agents 
who were working on the other side 
of the door.

This case has roused the rage 
of all decent citizens in San Diego 
proper and across the country. The 
case especially hits close to home for 
UCSD students. An unlucky student, 
caught in the worst place at the worst 
time, is suddenly and inexplicably 
tossed in a near-death experience. 

Five days ago, Chong was 
preparing for an onslaught of 
midterms. A week later, he was in 
the hospital with kidney failure and a 
punctured lung.

There are many unanswered 
questions that will likely spout up in 
the coming weeks when people begin 
to demand answers. The DEA will 
have to either answer the questions of 
how the hell they managed to forget 
an innocent person in a holding cell 
for five days, or face the public.

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU/GUARDIAN

For years, the Opinion section of the Thursday issue has been reserved for editorials, where 
the Guardian Editorial Board chimes 
in on everything from high-speed 
rail to administrative policies and 
“sensitive topics.” We routinely 
advocate outreach and transparency, 
suggesting that open access to 
information and a willingness to 
cooperate go a long way.

But we’ve rarely done outreach of 
our own. And now, as the Guardian is 
re-structuring and institutionalizing 
many of its formerly non-existent 
guidelines, it’s time to solicit opinion 
about our responsibilities and what 
we should do when reporting on 
issues — politics, campus climate —
that people are afraid to touch. 

Last Thursday, April 27, the 
Guardian published an article 
titled “Photo of A.S. Senator Draws 
Controversy,” regarding the reaction 
to a photo of current Campus-wide 
Senator Ashton Cohen dressed in 
Arab garb. The article, which has 

since been taken offline for the 
reasons outlined below, included 
quotes calling Cohen a racist and an 
Islamophobe. 

First, corrections: The clothing 
was not traditional Muslim clothing 
(as suggested by the subhead), but 
Arab clothing; the two terms are not 
interchangeable. This is a failure of 
reporting on our part, an example of 
our need to be more informed and a 
problem that I take responsibility for 
because it is always the duty of the 
reporter and editor to have the proper 
background knowledge. To that end, 
I’ve spoken with the reporter, and 
met with members of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee to 
learn more about this culturally 
sensitive issue so we can better report 
in the future. 

Another problem was the tone of 
the article. When citing Arab Student 
Union member Noor El-Annan, 
reporter Nicole Chan politicized 
the issue by associating El-Annan’s 
statements with Students for Justice 

in Palestine and implying that this 
situation was SJP versus Cohen — a 
stance that has been adopted by 
others (see this issue’s Letter to the 
Editor). Cohen, who is Jewish, voted 
against the resolution to divest from 
companies involved in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict; this undoubtedly 
plays into this issue, as he says that 
several people have linked the photo 
to his background and divestment. 
But regardless of the pro-divestment 
members who contacted Cohen, it is 
incorrect to assume that El-Annan 
was speaking on behalf of the 
political movement of divestment 
when she was speaking, more 
specifically, about an cultural issue. 

Cohen had serious concerns 
as well. The article paints him in 
a negative light, and words like 
“Islamophobe” and “racist” are words 
that no one wants to be associated 
with in SEO searches. These are 
the words of a source, and not the 

In light of  the controversy regarding a campus-wide senator’s photo and the Guardian’s poor 
reporting, we wish to issue an apology and encourage more 

dialogue between our staff  and the student body.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 3,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Dear Editor,
The article “Controversy Over 

Photo of A.S. Senator” claims that 
Ashton Cohen “dressed in Muslim 
garb” — what is “Muslim garb”? 
The keffiyeh and jalabiyah are two 
articles of non-religiously affiliated 
dress from the Middle East. These 
two articles of clothing are also not 
specific to a single ethnicity of the 
Middle East either, multiple peoples 
of the Middle East and North Africa 
have worn or continue to wear such 
clothing, not just Arabs. Berbers in 
North Africa and Jews and Kurds in 
the Middle East wear this traditional 
garb. I would know because both 
sides of my family are Middle Eastern 
Jews from the countries of Iraq, Syria 
and (where similar national costume 
existed), Iran. Cohen’s family is 
Middle Eastern, Jewish and Muslim, 
why does he not have a right to wear 
this? We Middle Eastern Jews refer 
to the “keffiyeh” as the “sudra” and 
we have worn it from ancient until 
modern times — if I were to wear my 
ancestor’s clothing out to a costume 
party as Cohen did, would I also be a 
victim of slander? 

Perhaps it is because Cohen is a 
Jew that this issue has been brought 
up. It is known that he is a Jewish 
student who ended up voting against 
the divestment resolution, and he 
contributed to the failure of Students 
for Justice in Palestine to achieve 
a passing of the resolution for the 
third year running. This case of the 
outright libeling of Cohen, in fact, 
raises some questions. SJP students 
themselves repeatedly claim that the 
Palestine issue has nothing to do with 
race, religion or color, so while it may 
be understandable to some people 
that the Muslim Student Association 
and Arab Student Union got 

involved here (although my previous 
paragraph should explain that this 
should not be the case either), we 
must ask: Why does SJP jump in to 
attack Cohen as well? Is this just an 
attempt to strike at those campus-
wide leaders who hold pro-Israel 
views? If there was someone who 
voted for divestment, and appeared in 
a similar photo as Cohen did, would 
he or she also be pursued?

The individuals who rally against 
Cohen here are frankly in no position 
to make claims about him. Noor 
El-Annan and Josue Castellon have 
been involved in several controversial 
actions and statements that have 
severely distressed the Jewish and 
wider student community at UCSD. 
El- Annan mentioned she would “not 
feel comfortable being in the same 
room as (Cohen),” the same may be 
said about her and Josue, from many 
students of the pro-Israel and Jewish 
community. And Amal Dalmar’s 
comparison to the Compton Cookout 
was unnecessary and out of line; she 
makes light of a distressing series of 
incidents that all UCSD students, 
regardless of race, experienced and 
suffered from. 

Ashton Cohen is an honorable 
A.S. member and an upstanding 
UCSD student. His reputation should 
not be tarnished by this heavily 
biased Guardian piece, this despicable 
piece of mockery.

▶ The Guardian welcomes letters from its readers. 
All letters must be addressed, and written, to 
the editor of the Guardian. Letters are limited 
to 500 words, and all letters must include the 
writer’s name, college and year (undergraduates), 
department (graduate students or professors) or 
city of residence (local residents). A maximum

Guardian Editorial Board reserves the right to 
edit for length, accuracy, clarity and civility. The 
Editorial Board reserves the right to reject letters 
for publication. Due to the volume of mail we 
receive, we do not confirm receipt or publication 
of a letter.

Guardian or the reporter, but in the age of 
Google searches, it’s imperative to provide 
proper context and avoid scapegoating. Both 
are more important than ever when stories 
are posted online and quickly become fodder 
for non-affiliates on both sides to read and 
attack; the article provided neither. Cohen and 
El-Annan have been attacked over the article, 
and for that, and the mistakes in the article, I 
sincerely apologize to both. 

In light of the poorly worded article, I 
offered both parties involved a chance to 
submit a guest commentary on any aspect 
of the issue; Cohen accepted, and his 
commentary provides background that we did 
not. He discusses his past outreach and efforts 
to rectify the situation. It is not our role to cast 
judgment on either side of the issue, but by 
not soliciting and including this information, 
the article became seriously skewed. 

This is not the first time the Guardian 
has slipped when covering sensitive issues. 
In the past, inconsistent editorial guidelines 
have forced our hand in printing guest 
commentaries and advertisements that we 
did not endorse. So, as we’re creating these 
guidelines, we’d like feedback from those we 
cover and those we write for: How can we 
best cover highly controversial issues in a 
neutral way? How can we avoid scapegoating 
individuals without avoiding names? When 
we make mistakes that contribute to a 
misunderstanding, how should we rectify the 
situation? 

And, perhaps most relevant: What is the 
role, if any, of the Guardian in “protecting” 
students?

Two years ago, when reporting on the 
Compton Cookout, we chose to publish on 
the front page the name of the student (and 
his affiliation with Pi Kappa Alpha) who 
hosted the party. 

I wrote the article, and I will never forget 
the call from said student telling my then-18-
year-old freshman self that I had ruined his 
life and caused him to leave San Diego for Los 
Angeles. 

I am not comparing Cohen’s actions or 
their implications to the Cookout, only the 

Guardian’s treatment of the issue. It was not 
factually inaccurate to print that the student 
hosted the party, just as it was not inaccurate 
to name Cohen. 

But, just as we left out context in this case, 
we did the same two years ago. Pi Kappa 
Alpha had not sanctioned the event, said 
student was not the only person who attended 
and he was not obviously single-handedly 
responsible for the events of the Compton 
Cookout or racism at UCSD. Yet, as the only 
one explicitly named, he still received multiple 
threats and now, when you Google his name, 
autofill still suggests “Compton Cookout” as a 
related search. 

Most student leaders whom we quote 
— including both Cohen and El-Annan — are 
public figures that have accepted a role that 
openly makes them targets for criticism. But 
the reality — one confirmed by the emails 
we get each month from long-ago students 
asking us to take down 1994 articles about 
them — is that these are still student leaders, 
not seasoned politicans. And when student 
journalists report on student leaders, there’s 
room for bad articles, even if there’s no bad 
intentions.

The Guardian will not cease reporting on 
issues of campus climate or dance around 
the subject of who and why. It is not our job 
to ensure that students don’t say things that 
they will regret in a decade, and many other 
students our age (ahem, Alexandra Wallace) 
have been dragged through the mud. 

But it is our job to avoid polarization, 
ensure that the reporting is accurate and 
students are fairly represented. To that 
end, we’d like your input on how we can 
improve our coverage and achieve our goal 
of providing balanced, informed news to 
the campus. If you have any comments or 
suggestions, please send a Letter to the Editor 
or just email editor@ucsdguardian.org. 

I’d like to thank both Cohen and El-Annan 
for contacting me, and encourage everyone 
to contact us with corrections, problems and 
inquiries. It’s how we stay relevant and useful.

And it keeps us honest. Thank you.

Dear Editor,
A coalition of students and 

workers are protesting Ron Paul at 
6 p.m. on Friday at Warren Mall. 
Why? 
1. He’s racist. Among the many 
things Paul has written (and later 
lied about) in over 50 documents: 
“I think we can safely assume 
that 95 percent of black males in 
[D.C.] are semi-criminal or entirely 
criminal” and “Our country is 
being destroyed by a group of 
actual and potential terrorists — 
and they can be identified by the 
color of their skin.”  
2. He’s sexist. He thinks that 
the federal government should 
not recognise same-sex unions. 
On sexual harassment at work: 
“Why don’t they quit once the 
so-called harassment starts?” The 
government can’t “tell an airline it 
must hire unattractive women if it 
does not want to.” 
3. He’s anti-gay. He’s for banning 
gay marriage and reinstating “Don’t 
Ask Don’t Tell.” On the AIDS 
Crisis: “The individual suffering 
from AIDS certainly is a victim 
— frequently, a victim of his own 
lifestyle — but this same individual 
victimizes innocent citizens by 
forcing them to pay for his care.” 
4. He’s xenophobic. Another 
Libertarian contradiction: He voted 
for a bill that included plans to 
build a government fence along the 
U.S.-Mexico border and is in favor 
of ending birthright citizenship and 
all social services to undocumented 
immigrants, who “discourage 
American citizens from taking low-
wage jobs.” Yay, slave wages! 
5. He’s ableist. He’s for repealing 
the Americans With Disabilities 
Act, which makes it illegal to 

discriminate against someone 
because of a disability. 
6. He’s anti-worker. He’s for ending 
unemployment insurance, the 
minimum wage, the Occupational 
Health and Safety Act (the right 
to a safe workplace) and replacing 
U.S. tax structure with one even 
more slanted toward the wealthy (if 
that’s possible.) 
7. He is against the Civil Rights 
Act, the 1964 law that made 
segregation illegal and outlawed 
discrimination on the basis of race, 
color, religion, sex or national 
origin. If a hotel wants to ban 
African-Americans, he believes 
they should be allowed to.  
8. He’s for dissolving the federal 
Department of Education. So why 
are UCSD students inviting him 
here?  
9. He’s for banning the right 
to choose abortion. Another 
Libertarian contradiction: He’s for 
the government intervening in a 
woman’s uterus. 
10. He’s for ending Medicare, 
Medicaid and Social Security and 
thinks the poor and elderly should 
rely on charity or be allowed to die. 
11. He’s against federal safety 
standards. No federal testing 
to make sure the products or 
pharmaceuticals you’re sold won’t 
kill you, no federal mandates for 
seat belts or air traffic controllers. 
12. He thinks global warming is 
a hoax. He wants to abolish the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
and environmental regulation, 
including all restrictions on drilling 
for oil, even in National Parks. 
13. He doesn’t “accept” evolution. 
14. He’s for ending all foreign 
aid and not sending funds to the 
developing world to help combat 
AIDS, famines, natural disasters or 
anything else. 
15. He’d pull out of the United 
Nations, which he called a 

conspiracy. 
16. He’s against interstate 
highways. 
17. He is against an assault 
weapons ban and background 
checks for buying new guns. 
18. He believes there’s a war on 
Christmas.  
19. He wants to U.S. to seize 
control of the Panama Canal. 
Paul’s isolationism doesn’t seem 
to apply to the Panama Canal. 
The United States signed a treaty 
back in the 1970s gradually 
ceding control of the canal to the 
government of Panama. But Paul 
wants to overturn that. Because 
if the U.S doesn’t seize control of 
it, he claims some hostile regime 
might seize control of it instead. 
20. He thinks interstate highways are 
unconstitutional. You’re probably 
getting the impression by now that 
Ron Paul thinks that pretty much 
everything the federal government 
does is unconstitutional. 

That’s because Ron Paul thinks 
that pretty much everything 
the federal government does is 
unconstitutional. 

He has even argued against 
interstate highways, saying 
Eisenhower knew he was bending 
the law when he built them. Paul 
figures they’re a violation of states’ 
rights.

Let him know that his racist, 
sexist, anti-worker policies won’t be 
tolerated.

There is a better alternative 
under a political ideology that will 
settle for no racism, no xenophobia, 
no sexism & homophobia, and 
no silly “patriotism” just because 
for once the patriot in question 
happens to be (sort-of) anti-war.

Essentially, the Hulk is the angry green thing. Believe me, you can’t miss him. He’s right there. His normal state is Bruce Banner, a mild man-
nered scientist who worked on making humans immune to gamma 
radiation. Like the Fantastic 4, science completely back�red and 
turned Banner into the aforementioned angry green thing. 
Like all superheroes, Banner saves the world, gets the 
girl and gets to transform back into Edward Norton/
Mark Ru�alo when he can calm his shit. �at’s 
more than can be said for the �ing. 
In the 2008 reboot of “�e Hulk” (in which 
he’s played by Edward Norton), Banner 
saves the world and manages to control his 
Hulk-transformations. At the end of the 
�lm, General Ross is approached by Tony 
Stark to create a team of superhumans. I 
don’t want to give anything away, but the 
team — it’s the Avengers.

Iron Man is everything an aspiring nerd should, well, aspire towards. Genius, playboy, millionaire Tony Stark was born a 
normal human with an incredible mental and �nancial capacity 
to do good. �e 2008 and 2010 �lms “Iron Man” and “Iron 
Man 2,” respectively provide needed exposition for a once 
relatively obscure character. A�er a piece of 
shrapnel embeds itself in Stark’s 
chest, a powerful electric 
generator called the arc 
reactor keeps him 
alive. �ankfully for the 
plotline, the generator lazer 
powers his super suit as well, 
which is not only an aesthetically 
pleasing color, but allows him to �y 
and shoot missiles out of his body. 
He is clearly the most Batman-like of the group, but 
lacks Bruce Wayne’s perpetually solemn personality 
and thankfully, a sidekick like Robin. Instead, while 
Stark saves the world, he combines Gambit’s charm 
with Deadpool’s wit into a personality that can only 
be described as killer. Basically, Iron Man is perfect.

M oonrise Kingdom,” the lat-est from beloved cult direc-tor Wes Anderson, is set for 
release on the 25th, and for fans 
who’ve attended midnight screenings, 

thrown Anderson-themed character 
costume parties and even curated an 
entire exhibition of fan art (as did 
San Francisco’s Spoke Art Gallery 
last November), it’s something to 
celebrate. 

For many others, it’s apparently 
torment. 

Since his modest crook-comedy 
debut “Bottle Rocket” in 1996, 
Anderson has quickly found his place 
under the “hipster” rug of shame 
beside such other arbitrary mytholog-
ical indicators as veganism, shopping 
at thrift stores, drinking Pabst Blue 
Ribbon beer and enjoying indepen-
dent music. 

But Wes Anderson’s films are not 
just scoffed at, they’re vehemently 
despised. And I’ve never really under-
stood why. Aside from enjoying 
Anderson’s dry humor, endearing 
characters and brilliantly indulgent 
sets, I’ve always thought his movies 
were mostly unassuming, heartwarm-
ing fun. Yet, now, the mention of 
Wes Anderson is met with a hatred 
typically reserved for snuff, or, say, 
Michael Moore. 

So why do these quiet, nostalgic 
movies attract such unadulterated 
hate? My first inclination would be 
that, stylistically, Anderson’s bor-
rowed heavily from classics past: 
everything from Orson Welles and 
Hal Ashby to Godard and the French 
New Wave. But given film’s brief his-
tory, the line between homage and

Of the Avengers, Hawkeye is one of only two to

arrows really really straight. 
He’s basically Katniss

In the 1960s, comic books took a turn for the team. In an e�ort to boost sales, comic book artists like Jack Kirby and Stan Lee 
combined favorite superheroes into teams, creating 

interesting dynamics and, of course, bigger battles. 
DC Comics came up with the Justice League, a 

crime �ghting unit 

of blue bloods that emulated the put together �nesse of the Ivy 
Leagues. Meanwhile, Marvel threw together six of its most popular, 
dysfunctional characters into what became the Avengers. Basically,

Thank god, it’s �nally here.We have been waiting for this movie since 2006, 
when Samuel L. Jackson 
waltzed into the last 
thirty seconds of Iron 
Man like an eyepatch-
wearing portent and 
�rst uttered the word 
“Avengers.” 

It has all the pyrotechnics of a 
blockbuster comic-book movie, but 
explosions alone do not a compel-
ling storyline make, and that is where 
writer and director Joss Whedon 

(“Bu�y the Vampire Slayer”) tri-
umphs where so many others run 

into trouble. His movie’s pri-
mary con�ict isn’t the arbitrary 
good-versus-evil blowout that 
characterizes these kinds of 
productions (fortunately for 
him, because his “evil” is pretty 
forgettable). Instead, Whedon’s 
main point is that the Avengers 
aren’t yet a team: they’re a “time 

bomb.”
�e personality clashes are epic 

and provide the driving force of the 
movie. Whedon clearly sacri�ced an 
engaging plot line for the sake of giv-

ing each of the larger-than-life heroes 
a little more depth, but superhero 
comic books have always been driven 
by personality, not nuance. It suits his 
medium.

�e �ick opens in a S.H.I.E.L.D. 
research facility where the Tes-
seract — the magical, all-powerful 
glowing cube of death from Captain 
America — is acting up, much to the 
alarm of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick 
Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Before you 
can say “deus ex machina” the cube’s 
twitching turns into a full-blown 
interdimensional portal, spitting 
out the unhinged Trickster god Loki 

(Tom Hiddleston). He slaughters the 
cube’s guards, uses his magical boom 
stick to brainwash a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent 
or two — including future Avengers 
member and archer extraordinaire 
Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) — then 
nabs the cube and �ees.

�is is Fury’s cue to kick-start 
the Avenger’s Initiative. As he rallies 
the troops — bringing in fellow 
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Black Widow 
(Scarlet Johansson), getting Cap-
tain America (Chris Evans) out of 
semi-retirement, retrieving the Hulk

theft has always been sort of vague. 
And if this were the case, Quentin 
Tarantino would be equally derided 
for his generous sampling from the 
classic Spaghetti Westerns and Seijun 
Suzuki’s absurd and stylish yakuza 
B-movies. 

No, the hatred stems from a 
deeper source: a point of no-return 
that plagues modern culture like 
some oozing, venomous, blog-savvy 
fungus. It is a dark nether-place 
known only as “cynicism,” and it is 
plainly outlined in the Cinephiliac’s 
economically-titled “Why I Hate Wes 
Anderson.”  

The first major gripe in the article, 
and one that I’ve most often encoun-
tered, is that Anderson’s characters 
are generally apathetic, unenthusiastic 
and unrealistic. This, in itself, seems 
like a blatant contradiction. I have 
trouble calling to mind a modern 
character more real than Bill Murray’s 
emotionally vacant, washed-up 
oceanographer/stoner Steve Zissou 
of the “The Life Aquatic” — easily 
Anderson’s most hated film. And 
maybe you didn’t have an unsettlingly 
articulate overachiever in the vein 
of “Rushmore”’s iconic rebel scholar 
Max Fischer at your high school, but 
I certainly did. 

Other cop-out arguments include 
that Anderson’s plots “never really 
go anywhere,” that his characters are 
never developed, and that his movies 
aren’t funny. For one, the characters 
are developed — albeit through 
subtle, often non-conventional means 
rather than sweeping character arcs 
and explosive melodrama. As for 
Anderson’s scripts, I suppose every-
one has expectations upon walking 
into a theater. In my experience, it’s 
more enjoyable to have as few as 
possible. I think Anderson’s films are 
hilarious, though my track record for 
gauging humor has never been great; 

I’m still honestly trying to under-
stand why everyone thought “the 
Hangover” was so damn funny. 

The unnamed author ends his or 
her article: “If stuck in a room with 
either a Tyler Perry movie or a Wes 
Anderson film, I’d break both DVDs 
and slit my wrists to escape the slow 
torture I would have to endure by 
watching either.” 

Like I said: oozing fungus. 
The simple truth is that these 

films should be neither worshiped 
nor abhorred. Wes Anderson is noth-
ing more than a gifted filmmaker 
with a knack for clever writing and 
immaculate detail, not to mention, 
the lost art of the movie soundtrack. 

Also, “Moonrise Kingdom” 
just looks fantastic. Expanding on 
“Fantastic Mr. Fox”’s extremely suc-
cessful attempt at family comedy 
(which even managed to turn the 
heads of Anderson’s ardent critical 
naysayers), the film is a runaway love 

story starring mostly children that 
looks as vibrant and perfectly-cast 
as any film he’s done. And whether 
Anderson’s style is in your own per-
sonal taste (and, like anything, it’s 
certainly not for everyone), it’s impos-
sible to deny that films this adventur-
ous and visually engaging are few 
and far between in modern film. It’s 
perplexing why these cynics seem to 
target genuine attempts at innovation, 
rather than the increasingly homog-
enized mainstream. 

Anderson’s most vocal oppo-
nents will likely always be those who 
haven’t any interest in watching his 
films in the first place. It’s reassur-
ing, after all, to picture some affluent, 
white cotton suit-wearing film school 
grad taking his work far too seriously 
and earning shallow accolades from 
a pompous, self-denying fanbase. 
However this is simply not the case 
with Wes Anderson and his gorgeous, 
subtly hilarious brand of cinema.

months, using their experience to write Cape Dory, a charming album of 
nautically themed pop songs that evoked sixties girl groups and classic

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 3,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9

(Mark Ru�alo) from his hideout in 
India and bullying Tony Stark (Robert 
Downey Jr.) into leaving Stark Tower 
— �or (Chris Hemswoth) reappears 
from Asgard to deal with the black 
sheep of the family. 

Now is the time for the Aveng-
ers to assemble. Unfortunately for 
Fury, it’s not that simple — Evans’ 
straightedge Captain clashes with 
Stark’s braggadocio and daddy issues, 
which mesh nicely with �or’s man 
pain over his genocidal baby brother. 
Hulk’s problems are all personal, but 
explosive enough to be a collective 
concern. Whedon’s trademark snark 
reigns throughout their interactions, 
keeping the dialogue fast-paced and 
genuinely funny through a lot of 
exposition. I shudder to think how he 
will up the one-liner ante of Spider-
man (the undisputed comic-book 
king of quips) if he joins the team in 
the next movie.

Downey Jr. brings the same wry 
wit to his character that made Iron 
Man so fun to watch six years ago. 
S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Widow, Hawk-
eye and Phil Coulson (Gregg Clark) 
have some of the most interesting 
teases of the movie in terms of their 
shared past (Please, Marvel, say that a 
super-assassin backstory movie is in 
the works?) and their give-and-take 
support system provides a nice foil to 
the isolated insecurities of the rest of 
the team.

But the true sleeper favorite is 
Ru�alo’s Hulk, much in the way 
that Downey Jr.’s Stark was in the 
�rst “Iron Man.” He’s perfect and a 
surprise standout because you didn’t 
expect him to be. His sheepish self-
awareness contrasts beautifully with 
the Hulk’s sheer destructive rage — 
a�er years of bad movies and worse 
CGI treatment, Whedon and Ru�alo 
have �nally found a sweet spot and 
brought the un-jolly green giant to 
life. 

�e aliens themselves are ge-
nerically, and unremarkably, evil. 
Whedon makes a good call, then, by 
personalizing the movie’s “evil” with 
Hiddleston’s Loki. �e con�ict of the 
movie is driven by his megalomania-
cal one-man circus of insecurities. 
Hiddleston displays his character’s 
psychoses brilliantly, and even manag-
es to garner some sympathy for Loki’s 
daddy issues despite the fact that you 
watched him pluck a man’s eye out the 
frame before. His big ol’ ball of crazy 
makes his doomed campaign interest-
ing enough to keep watching once the 
Avengers get their act together.

�e comic-book in�uence bleeds 
through into the cinematography 
from time to time in the kind of 
heroic, backlit lingering shots that 
wouldn’t look out of place in paper 

and ink. One sequence in particular 
pans through the ruins of downtown 
Manhattan to each of the scattered 
Avengers in turn, as they struggle 
from their di�erent vantage points to 
hold o� the alien invasion. It’s a slow 
shot, lovingly done, and the kind of 
staging that comes straight out of a 
comic book.

Overall, it’s a paragon of its genre 
— genuinely funny, with characters 
that have honest-to-god layers, and 
enough explosions to keep the most 
diehard of Michael Bay fans happy. It’s 
an excellent payo� a�er years of wait-
ing. But then again, if you’re a diehard 
comic book fan (especially of the 
In�nity Gauntlet) who’s not satis�ed, 
stick around a�er the credits; looks 
like the Avengers franchise will have 
one more chance to get it right.

Sharp Script, Hulk Make ‘Avengers’ a Success
▶ AVENGERS, from page 6

L ower Dens’ Nootropics is named a�er the class of cognitive enhancers known 
commonly as “smart drugs.” It’s 
a surprisingly apt name — the 
Baltimore band’s anticipated 
sophomore release is decidedly 
cerebral music.

Lead singer/songwriter Jana 
Hunter’s vocals are sleekly subdued 
and contemplative to the point 
that she sounds like a reassuring 
voice in your head. “Brains,” a 
circular journey that starts with 
a repetitive motorik rhythm 
pattern that sounds eerily like 
a train, eventually builds into a 
frantic jumble of sounds. �e song 
gradually ends with that same 
solitary train slinking into the next 

track, as Hunter coos “Don’t be 
afraid.” Her voice is so calming that 
you don’t worry when she whispers, 
“Everything will change while 
you’re asleep.” 

Hunter’s vocals are paired with 
hazy guitar and synthesizer textures 
that infuse the entire album with 
an excellent sense of brooding, 
electronic-tinged atmosphere. 
In the chorus of “Propagation,” 
Hunter matches the vacillations 
of her voice to the rising guitar 
licks, intertwining the two into 
one haunting sound. Again on 
“Lamb,” Hunter’s spacious wails 
atop a building bass line morph 
into a sound that is only kept from 
soaring o� into the stratosphere by 
the sparse punctuation of a drum 
kit.

Nootropics ends with a �ttingly 
re�ective track. “In the End is the 
Beginning” is an expansive 12-min-
ute odyssey that never rises above a 
whisper. “I feel di�erent now than I 
did before,” Hunter murmurs. A�er 
hearing Nootropics, chances are you 
will too. (7/10)

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 3,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

against the Tritons at the campus of 
CSU Monterey Bay, this week, Friday, 
May 4.

GAME 1
Last-seeded UCSD came up 

against No. 9 nationally ranked CSU 
Dominguez Hills in the first round 
of the tournament. Senior righthander 
Camille Gaito went the distance, allow-
ing just three hits and one walk, keep-
ing the Toros scoreless throughout. 
UCSD’s one run came in the top of the 
sixth inning.

With senior Kris Lesovsky — lead-
ing the team in batting average and 
slugging percentage — on third base 
with one out, UCSD head coach Patti 
Gerckens called for the squeeze.

Batting in the three-hole, sopho-
more catcher Caitlin Brown dropped a 
bunt to bring Lesovsky in to score.

“Once [Lesovsky] got on base and 
[Willmon] moved her to third, I knew 
that [Gerckens] was probably going 
to give me a bunt so when she did I 
prepared for it, and I knew [Lesovsky] 
would score,” Brown said in an email 
interview.

GAME 2

The Tritons came from behind in 
the conference semifinal to take the 
win from third-seed Chico State.

The Wildcats went up 2–0 in the 
second inning. 

With two outs and men on sec-
ond and third, designated hitter Emily 
McEnaney singled through the right 
side for one RBI. McEnaney made her 
way round the bases, and was brought 
in to score off a single by Chico’s Kelly 
Keefe.

UCSD would not respond until the 
bottom of the sixth inning. 

Back at the top of the order, 
Lesovsky, sophomore Kirsten Willmon 
and Brown loaded the bases. Batting 
cleanup, sophomore Charly Swanberg 
— CCAA first team selection — came 
up in the clutch, singling to right center 
to score two runs. From there, Gaito — 
pitching in her second straight game 
— kept the Toros scoreless in their last 
at-bat. 

In the bottom of the seventh inning, 
Brown singled with men on first and 
third to score the winning run. 

GAME 3
Neither squad was in want of 

offense in the opening match of the 

title bout. 
The Tritons recorded two unearned 

runs off a fielding error in the first 
inning to go up 3–0 early. 

The Otters tied the score in the 
bottom of the third inning, hitting up 
freshman pitcher Michelle Escamilla 
for five hits before she was relieved by 
junior Jennifer Manuel. 

UCSD took back the lead in the 
fourth inning off a big double by junior 
Nicole Spangler, going up 4–3. The 
Tritons were unable to stay on top 
as Monterey Bay recorded three runs 
on three hits in the fourth inning to 
cement the win. 

GAME 4
Pitching her third game in three 

days, Gaito allowed just one run while 
recording seven strikeouts in the last 
game of the tournament.

The Tritons would not recover from 
a one run deficit until the bottom of the 
fifth inning, when a costly Otter error 
allowed UCSD to tie the score. Next up, 
Lesovsky singled to right field to score 
sophomore Emily McQuaid, giving the 
Tritons a 4–1 lead.

in the hole off a homerun by desig-
nated hitter Nick Rodarte. 

The Golden Eagles went yard 
again in the bottom of the fifth 
inning with a solo homerun off third 
baseman Daniel Duran.

UCSD took one back off a double 
by Liske in the sixth inning, and in 
the eighth inning socred another run 
off a Rahn single down the middle, 
but it wasn’t enough to close the gap. 

GAME 4
The Tritons were shut out in the 

series finale as Golden State pitcher 
Gabriel Asakura went the distance, 
allowing UCSD just two hits while 
recording eight strikeouts. 

Cal State Los Angeles went up 
2-0 in the bottom of the first inning. 
The Golden Eagles loaded the bases, 
setting up rightfielder Cliff Quick 
to record two RBIs. Cal State Los 
Angeles picked up one more run in 
the fifth inning.

UCSD had no response.

safe, or go out and do what others 
tell me I can’t. 

Theodore Roosevelt, in his 
“Man in the Arena” speech, gives 
credit to the man who goes out 
and strives for greatness, who 
succeeds at the highest level in 
the best case, or, in the worst case, 
fails in a great cause knowing 
that he, “at least fails while daring 
greatly, so that his place shall 
never be with those cold and timid 
souls who neither know victory 
nor defeat.”

You can live life safely, but how 
fulfilling is a life lived pristinely 
yet sterile behind a desk or a set 
of diplomas? Living life this way 
just seems to be a waste of the few 
moments we all come across where 
we can be more than we imagined, 
more than we can allow ourselves 
to hope for. 

My dad tried out for the 
Warriors and made it to the last 
round of cuts, but was cut in favor 
of a player who was not as good 
at the time, but who the coaches 
thought had more potential. He 

did not make an NBA team, but 
played post-collegiate ball in the 
Pro-Am league and led his team to 
two National Titles. My dad laid 
it all out on the line, and I respect 
him more than I can say on this 
page for doing that.

I have found my moment in the 
javelin, and even if I fail, I will fail 
knowing that I gave it everything I 
had and then some. And when it’s 
all over, I will be a better person 
for it because I will be able to look 
back and know that I spent my life 
fully pursuing greatness.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, MAY 3,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor
BASEBALL — The Tritons finished 
CCAA regular season play last week-
end, April 26 to 28 with a home-
and-away series against Cal State Los 
Angeles.

The Tritons split the four-game 
series with the Golden Eagles, tak-
ing the first two games at home and 
dropping the last two on the road. 

“On Saturday’s games we just 
seemed to be trying a little too hard 
at the plate to create offense,” senior 
righthander Elias Tuma said.

The Tritons are the only team 
to have clinched a CCAA tourna-
ment berth in the conference. With 
a 26-14 CCAA record, the Tritons sit 
in first place for now, but will await 
the results of second place Chico 
State and third place Cal State San 
Bernardino, who both have one con-
ference series to play.

“We’re waiting to see how every-
one finishes conference to figure 
out our ranking,” lefthanded pitcher 
Richard Kilbury said. “This week at 
practice we’re going to try and work 
on getting back to the basics and get-
ting the fundamentals down, going 
forward.”

UCSD has one more series in 
the regular season before postsea-
son play. The Tritons will host a 
two-game series with Grand Canyon 
University this Friday and Saturday, 
May 4 to 5.  UCSD will then have one 
week to prepare for the conference 
tournament, to be held the following 
weekend at Triton Ballpark.

GAME 1
Junior starter Ryan Goodbrand 

went seven innings, recording six 
strikeouts and allowing just one walk, 
to record his eighth win of the season 
in the series opener.

Junior Danny Susdorf — named 

the CCAA player of the week — 
doubled to right field, stole third base 
and was brought home on a ground 
out by first baseman Richard Siegel. 

The Tritons doubled the lead in 
the fourth inning, off a big single 
from Gregg Ringold that scored right-
fielder Scott Liske. UCSD cemented 
the win in the bottom of the seventh 
inning, as Siegel picked up his second 
RBI with a single to right field.

GAME 2
The top of the Triton batting order 

remained hot into the second game of 
the series, as UCSD took three runs 
in the bottom of the first. 

Susdorf, arguably the fastest man 
on the roster, made his way round 
the bases, scoring on a throwing error 

by the Cal State Los Angeles short-
stop. Cleanup hitter Nick La Face was 
walked to bring on sophomore Justin 
Rahn, who singled to left field for two 
RBI. The Tritons continued to get on 
base, recording five runs on six hits in 
their next four innings — generating 
offense from around the lineup. 

La Face finished with three RBI on 
four hits, while sophomore Garrett 
Tuck, junior Sam Michaels and Rahn 
all finished with two RBI.  

GAME 3
The Golden Eagles took the early 

lead, scoring one run in the second 
inning off an infield error. Cal State 
Los Angeles put the Tritons two more

A fter being swept in their last series of the regular season, the Tritons rallied in the 
CCAA conference tournament last 
weekend, April 27 to April 29 to take 
the program’s first-ever tournament 
title and a NCAA Regional berth.

“At the CCAA [tournament] our 
team played with heart,” UCSD assis-
tant coach Jessica Millsap said in an 
email interview. “We had solid defense, 
great pitching, clutch hitting and an 
energy in the dugout that was undeni-
able.”

The conference tournament was 
held in Stockton, Calif. and featured 
the top four finishing teams: No. 1 CSU 
Monterey Bay, No. 2 CSU Dominguez 
Hills, No. 3 Chico State and No. 4 
UCSD.

“I thought the team competed the 
best they have all year,” UCSD head 
coach Patti Gerckens said in an email 
interview. “There was a lot of energy 
throughout the entire weekend and 
whether we were winning or behind, 
the team was completely focused on 
the game. They really had each other’s 
back and picked each other up during 
the entire tournament.”

The Tritons went 3–1 in the dou-

ble elimination tournament, upsetting 
nationally ranked CSU Dominguez 
Hills in their tournament opener and 
splitting with No. 7 CSU Monterey Bay 
in the tournament final. The Tritons 
conceded a tough 9–5 loss to the Otters 
— the only team to sweep UCSD in 
program history — in the first game of 
the championship match up. In the sec-
ond game of the double header, UCSD 
senior pitcher Camille Gaito led the 
Tritons to the tournament title. 

The CCAA title grants UCSD 
— the defending NCAA Division II 
National Champions — the automatic 
bid with sixth-seed in the West Region 
finals, where the Tritons will face No. 3 

Dixie State.
“I believe the team is ready and pre-

pared for the Regional tournament and 
excited for it to begin,” Gerckens said. 
“Playing [Dixie State] will be different 
because we haven’t played them this 
year yet. We are going to take one game 
at a time and compete in every game.”

Third-seed Dixie State clinched the 
automatic qualifier, winning the Pacific 
West Athletic Conference tournament 
with two blowouts against Grand 
Canyon University last week, April 27. 
The Red Storm will be making their 
fourth straight tournament appearance

NOLAN THOMAS/GUARDIAN

Your last year in college is always a weird place to find yourself. You have 
accomplished something great 
in getting through the past four 
years of school, but the future, the 
next year, is paralyzingly scary. 

Senior year in college is especially 
worrying. It’s this moment in your 
life that your parents have planned 
to get you to. Now they will be 
cutting off the lead rope of your 
life. Now you have to kick it on 
your own. 

For myself, the past four years 
have been highlighted, bolded and 
double underlined by two things: 
being on the track team and 
getting into law school. 

Now, though, real life looms 
and the “right way” is not so 
clearly defined. 

I was accepted to law school, 
but I’m not going. I’m staying 
right here, as many of our Triton 
athletes have, in order to try to get 
to that elusive next level. 

This has been the scariest 
decision of my life. The easy way, 
going to law school, ensures me a 
good salary, a safe retirement and 
all the trappings of being a lawyer. 

Being a professional javelin 
thrower, although sounding 
glamorous, is not.

I will not be making any money 
unless I am one of the top five in 
the world, and even then I would 
be making less than the lowest 
paid fourth-stringer in the NFL. 
You probably could also name 
some fourth string lineman, but 
not even the very best American 
javelin thrower.

Why would I do this then? I do 
it because there are only so many 
moments in life, and each one 
should be used to its fullest.

I will only be 22 once. I will 
only be here, with the physical 
gifts I have, for a very short 
amount of time. I can either be
