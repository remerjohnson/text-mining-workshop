Afﬁrmative 
Action Under 
New Review

By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin
News Editor

Fourteen years after Prop.osition 209 banned 
affirmative action in California in 1996, a pri-
marily student-based coalition called “By Any 
Means Necessary” is filing a class-action lawsuit 
— which names Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
and UC President Mark Yudof as defendants — 
to overturn Prop. 209 and reinstate affirmative 
action in California’s public schools.

The lawsuit, filed on Feb. 16, argues that Prop. 
209 is unconstitutional, as it violates students’ 
14th Amendment rights by mandating separate 
and unequal procedures for minority students. 
The legal brief states that Prop.. 209 was “specifi-
cally intended to decrease or hold down Latina/o, 
black and Native-American enrollment.”

“We can’t allow the separate and unequal con-
ditions that are not only continuing in California, 
but which are legally in place, and legally codi-
fied with Prop.osition 209,” Northern California 
Coordinator of BAMN Yvette Felarca said. 

If successful, the lawsuit would allow public 
schools — like the University of California — to 
reinstate affirmative action. It would not, however, 
guarantee any university action. According to 

Pi Kappa Alpha and the less publicized frater-nities responsible for 
the “Compton Cookout” are 
breathing a deep sigh of relief 
right now, because — just in 
the nick of time — the Koala 
has dependably swooped in to 
steal the spotlight.

All anger directed toward 
the Feb. 15 Black History 
Month-mocking frat party was 
quickly shifted to the campus 
humor newspaper everyone 
loves to hate on Thursday 
night, when Koala Editor in 
Chief Kris Gregorian dropped

Two words aired on 
Student-Run Television 
Thursday night brought 
UCSD into the national 
spotlight — and into yet 
another campus free-
speech debate. After Kris 
Gregorian, editor in chief  
of humor newspaper the 
Koala, said that protestors 
of last week’s controversial 
“Compton Cookout” party 
were “ungrateful niggers” 
on Channel 18, the Black 
Student Union declared a 
“State of Emergency” and 
issued a six-page list of 
demands to the university.

In response to the out-
rage — expressed principal-
ly by the black population at 
UCSD, or about 1.3 percent 
of 22,000 undergraduates — 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
immediately shut down 
SRTV. Then, on Friday 
afternoon, he unexpectedly 
decided to freeze all student 
fees toward media organiza-
tions.

Party Foul
The Feb. 15 Cookout 

was a racially themed 
fraternity party widely con-
demned by the BSU and the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, along with 
Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox and Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue. 

According to ABC 10 
News, the party was held 
at the home of Pi Kappa 
Alpha member Elliot Van 
Nostrand, who was also 
responsible for creating the

In an effort to bring an all-campus 
feel to the annual Sun God Festival, 
Associate Vice President of A.S. Concerts 
and Events Alex Bramwell announced 
plans to fund daytime events at each of 
UCSD’s six colleges at an open forum 
held on Feb. 18. 

According to Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Council President Brandon 

Chirco, although the A.S. Council has 
been working with the college councils 
since Fall Quarter, details of the col-
laboration are still being ironed out.

“It has been brought up to our coun-
cil at the Council of Chairs meetings, 
and we are discussing the practicalities 
of it,” Chirco said. “What we know is 
that [the A.S. Council] is going to match 
us up to $500. So basically, if we spend

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

:*0,5*,�AND�;,*/5636.@

By Megha Ram
Staff Writer

After identifying the location of 
stem-cell production in the blood 
vessels of zebrafish, biologists at 
UCSD hope to one day use the infor-
mation to simplify human medical 
procedures like bone-marrow trans-
plants.

In the future, scientists will ide-
ally be able stimulate the growth of 
a sick patient’s own stem cells, then 
re-direct them to the area where they 
are needed — such as the bone mar-
row. This would greatly decrease the 
chances of infection or graft-versus-
host disease, in which the donor cells 
reject or attack the body.

The research team that discov-
ered the location was headed by 
assistant professor of biology David 
Traver, postdoctoral fellow in Traver’s 
laboratory Julien Bertrand, assistant 
professor of medicine Neil Chi and 
professor of biochemistry at UC San 
Francisco Didier Stainier. 

Bertrand 
said he thought 
zebrafish might 
be good cell providers 
because they have proven 
to be a standard test model 
for other vertebrates, including 
humans. The zebrafish embryo is also 
more accessible in its developmental 
stages than the traditional lab rat.

 “[The formation of blood cells] 
has been thoroughly described in 
the mouse embryo, but since mouse 
development occurs in utero, it is 
not accessible for direct imaging,” 
Bertrand said. “Zebrafish develop-
ment — on the other hand — occurs 
in a petri dish, because fertilization is 

external in fish.” 
The cells — more specifically 

known as hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs) — have the ability to gener-
ate many types of cells. These include 
white blood cells, which affect the 
immune system, and red blood cells 
like platelets, which help in clotting.

 According to Bertrand, this dis-
covery is an important step toward 

understanding how to produce HSCs 
from types of artificial stem cells that 
are either more readily available or 
more limited. These HSCs would 
then have the potential to create any 
cell the body might need.

“[Through imaging,] I could 
observe the ‘transformation’ of flat 
endothelial cells along the aorta into 
round [bone-marrow] stem cells,” 
Bertrand said. 

Now that scientists have identified 
the area where HSCs are produced, 
they can begin trying to produce 
them independently of a donor. 
Patients with blood or bone-marrow 
diseases — like cancer or leukemia 
— would undergo a transplant with 
HSCs that are already compatible 
with their immune systems.

 Because the zebrafish embryo is 
transparent, biologists easily observed 
and studied the growth of the fish as 
they developed in their eggs.

NEWS� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

highly criticized Facebook event. 
(The PIKE active roster has been 

removed from the fraternity’s Web 
site. Robby Naoufal, president of the 
Inter-Fraternity Council, said he had 
no access to fraternity rosters.)

To complicate the matter further, a 
Youtube video has surfaced featuring 
black Internet personality Jiggaboo 
Jones, in which he claims the party 
was a promotional event for his DVD 
release. The video is widely linked in 
comments on news stories and forums 
— used to prove party planners 
weren’t being racist.

Jones confirmed he was affiliated 
with the party. 

“I am very upset that they would 
pick out my fans to try to get back at 
me and to start this madness,” he said. 

Though IFC adviser Emily 
Feinstein stated the incident was 
neither funded nor sponsored by 
any fraternity, PIKE has received 
much of the blame. An anony-
mous member of PIKE said the 
fraternity is planning to sue the 
university for slander. Both Naoufal 
and Campuswide Senator Tobias 
Haglund, a member of PIKE, said 
they were unaware of this plan. 

Neither PIKE president Garron 
Engstrom nor Van Nostrand could 
be reached for comment. 

The N-Word
After an impromptu Campus 

Black Forum was held Tuesday night 
and administrators instated the 
“Racism: Not In Our Community” 
campaign, Thursday night’s SRTV 
broadcast revived campus upset.

At 7:30 p.m., the station aired a 
segment in which Muir College junior 
Yelena Akopian interviewed three stu-
dents who planned to throw a similar 
“Black History Month” party. The stu-
dents went on air complaining about 
the protests and defending their party 
as protected by the First Amendment.

According to SRTV manager-in-

training Panham Morini, this broad-
cast inspired Gregorian to comment 
on the Cookout during the Koala’s 
regular 10 p.m. show.

“After the initial three guys left, the 
Koala made the topic Black History 
Month, and they started doing a show 
that was normal for Koala TV stan-
dards,” Morini said.

Over the course of the show, Koala 
members made controversial com-
ments, linking HIV to sexuality and 
race, and attacking black protesters of 
the Cookout.

“The material was not too differ-
ent from typical Koala fodder,” Morini 
said. “But the timing for these state-
ments was definitely off.”

According to assistant professor of 
ethnic studies Sarah Clarke Kaplan, 
students returning from a second 
Campus Black Forum — which 
included dialogue with PIKE repre-
sentatives — were heckled by Koala 
members who wanted them to appear 
on the show. Gregorian denied these 
allegations. 

After the students declined to 
participte, they returned to their resi-
dences and began to watch Koala TV.  
Shocked by the content, they alerted 
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena to the broadcast,  who then noti-
fied A.S. President Gupta. 

According to Gupta, he immedi-
ately called station manager Thomas 
Dadourian — who was downstairs 
at Porter’s Pub filming a live perfor-
mance — and asked him to inter-
vene. Dadourian said he returned to 
the studio and changed the subject 
of the show, although he thought it 
unwise to go off air mid-feed. 

“I just went on camera and got 
them to change the subject with-
out [them] knowing that they’ll be 
censored,” he said. “So I got them to 
stop, but by then it was already too 
late.”

Over text message and e-mail, 
members of the BSU mobilized 
Thursday night, and began writing a 

press release with demands.
The next morning, Feb. 19, the 

BSU released a six-page statement 
declaring the campus environment 
to be “toxic,” and issued a list of 32 
demands. These include the creation 
of a “safe space” for black students on 
campus, a permanent task force to 
fund outreach efforts, funds to match 
those of S.P.A.C.E.S. and O.A.S.I.S. 
and implementation of holistic-review 
admissions by 2011 — a system 
that takes into account a candidate’s 
entire application instead of assign-
ing specific point values, like the 
Comprehensive Review system UCSD 
currently uses. 

In response to the Koala TV 
broadcast, the BSU held a protest at 
8 a.m. the next morning on Library 
Walk. Approximately 200 people 
dressed in black marched to the A.S. 
Forum in Price Center, where they 
held a two-hour conference with the 
entire university cabinet. Students 
called for awareness of their actions 
on campus, and for the chancellor to 
meet the BSU demands.

During the conference, BSU 
members went to the SRTV station 
to search for a copy of the tape, to no 
avail. However, they did find a piece 
of cardboard on the floor with the 
words “Compton Lynching” written 
on it. The note has since been turned 
over to police as “evidence.”

According to Sixth College fresh-
man Thieny Nguyen, the only avail-
able recording of the show was made 
by BSU Vice Chair Fnann Keflezighi’s 
on her cell phone. 

Both Vice Chancellor Penny Rue 
and BSU member Grant White, a 
Marshall College freshman, said that 
Fox read each of the BSU’s demands 
out loud, agreeing to meet many 
of them instantly — like providing 
increased funding for the African-
American studies minor and ethnic 
studies programs.

ALLEGED MASTERMIND BEHIND “COMPTON COOKOUT”

a drunken “ungrateful niggers” bomb 
on what had to be the greatest viewer-
ship Channel 18 has seen since Koala 
TV’s pornographic glory days. It was 
a terrible judgment call, made all the 
more cruel by its timing. The Black 
Student Union was fresh out of a 
Campus Black Forum and watching, 
waiting for an inevitable battle cry 
from the Koala camp.

Later that night, A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta shut down the recently 
revamped Student-Run Television 
(which he claims he didn’t know was 
airing Koala TV, though it’s the chan-
nel’s most consistent programming) 
in response. BSU Chairpersons David 
Ritcherson and Fnann Keflezighi 
declared UCSD’s campus climate was 
in a “State of Emergency” by 7:30 a.m. 
the next morning.

The back-and-forth was to be 
expected, but then Gupta took an 
unforeseen leap: He froze funding for 
all 33 student publications. “In any 
game where the players are getting 
hurt, you hit the pause button,” he 
said. Translation: If things start get-
ting heated, you duct-tape the mouths 
of all those who might cause more 

trouble within your kingdom.
Though he has made it clear the 

A.S. Council is indeed doing every-
thing it can to legally defund the 
Koala, his taboo Friday-morning deci-
sion was not a last-minute attempt to 
crush UCSD’s most controversial rag 
— which can be counted on to bal-
loon the Cookout controversy to epic 
proportions. Anybody with a scrap of 
institutional memory knows the Koala 
will go to print, even if members have 
to write the issue in their own feces on 
spools of toilet paper. In fact, they’d 
probably love that.

No, Gupta’s freeze is obviously a 
lesson — one that contradicted his 
self-proclaimed undying commit-
ment to enabling free student press. 
Outraged Black Student Unioners are 
demanding their fees not fund Koala 
hate speech, so Gupta feels he has to 
demonstrate the widespread conse-
quences of making that dream come 
true — seeing as, by law, the A.S. 
Council cannot choose to defund cer-
tain publications based on content.

What we’ve learned: Gupta val-
ues dictatorial, learn-the-hard-way 
parenting over the unconditional 
preservation of free speech (or at 

least open dialogue) at UCSD, and is 
unfortunately equipped with absolute 
power over the A.S. budget. Sure, he 
has promised the media-org funding 
freeze will only last a week or two, 
depending on the progress made 
at a public committee meeting this 
Thursday or Friday. (Vice President 
of Finances Peter Benesch and 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Andrew Ang, a known 
adversary of the Koala, predict it will, 
in fact, last into Spring Quarter.) But 
considering forum attendees will take 
the form of both enraged BSU mem-
bers and First Amendment warriors 
like the Koala, it’s safe to say there’s lit-
tle chance for peaceful understanding 
or resolution. Only destined to add 
more fuel to the fire is Gupta’s posses-
sive attitude: “I can ask at any time for 
anyone to leave the room,” he said.

Ironically, the freeze pretty much 
guarantees that Koala commentary 
will be the only physical media avail-
able during the next week of turmoil, 
as orgs without the same blood-
thirsty penchant to claw at open 
wounds aren’t so likely to spill sweat

A Sunday morning walk across campus doesn’t offer much in the way of visual stimula-
tion. Both bedheaded and dismayed 
by the fact that there’s still nowhere 
on campus to get decent coffee at 11 
a.m., I’m not typically very aware of 

my surroundings before that obliga-
tory second cup, nor in any place to 
make observations more insightful 
than “Shit, I knew it was a bad idea 
to wear suede.”

Today was a little different. 
Passing through Muir College, I saw 
something to force me out of my 
mid-morning haze — something 
so uncommon here that I had little 
choice but to stop and wipe the 
sleep out of my eyes to be sure that 
what appeared before me was not a 
mere hallucination or sleep-deprived 
mirage: graffiti. 

The mere sight of the tagged 
building was almost startling enough 
to make me wonder if I was still on 
our campus, and not in an alter-
nate universe in which students 
get angry enough to deface school 
property and coffee shops are open 
on weekend mornings. The text itself 
was equally striking: The first bit 
read “No Justice, No Peace” in red 
lettering, and the other end of the 
building read: “Know Justice, Know 
Peace” in blue.  

At a time when both justice and 
peace have come into question on 
campus, the writing relayed a simple 
message — a call to action, really — 
that, displayed brazenly in one of the 
most trafficked areas on campus, is 
also impossible to ignore. Though 
I’m not usually the biggest fan of 
campus graffiti outside the infamous 
hipster confines of the Mandeville 
Center stairwell, the lit major inside 
me had to admit: It’s powerful phras-
ing.

Dear Editor,
We submit that the so-called 

“Compton Cookout” incident has less 
to do with the racist culture of a par-
ticular fraternity or the Greek system 
in general (although that is certainly a 
factor) than it does with long-stand-
ing structural problems at UCSD — 
lack of a critical mass of faculty and 
students of color, generic (specific, 
community-neutral) approaches to 
improving campus climate, a very low 
profile and poorly funded African-
American and Chicano studies cur-
ricular programs, etc. Together all of 
these institutional weaknesses pro-
duce a campus climate that embold-
ens the kind of racism we saw in the 
language and proposed activities of 
the “Compton Cookout.”

We urge the administration to 
avoid psychological interpretations of 
the incident. Individual behavior and 
attitudes are not the primary source 

of the problem. It will not be enough 
to oppose racist speech with “more 
speech,” with lessons about the limits 
of satire or even with well intentioned 
but ultimately symbolic campaigns 
such as the proposed “Not in Our 
Community” initiative.

This incident, and the potential for 
others in the future, should convince 
campus policymakers that serious 
structural changes are long overdue. 
In our opinion, the administration 
should take immediate action and 1) 
commit to permanent and substantial 
funding and staffing for the African 
American Studies Minor, 2) establish 
an Organized Research Unit to con-
duct research on local communities 
of color that are underrepresented at 
UCSD, 3) create a task force to study 
the desirability of rotating public art 
installations linked to underrepresent-
ed minority communities (preferably 
local) and 4) reorganize the office of 
the Chief Diversity Officer in order to 
facilitate the writing of a campuswide 
plan for addressing campus climate 
with a focus on how climate affects 

specific groups. 
We understand that in a time 

of budgetary constraints, some of 
these proposed solutions will be dif-
ficult to implement. And yet these 
kinds of changes ought to receive the 
highest priority if we are to believe 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox when 
she says the campus has a serious 
commitment to diversity. What 
is undeniable is that UCSD must 
change what it has been doing on the 
diversity front up until now. It’s sim-
ply not working.

Dear Editor,
The university was right to con-

demn the “Compton Cookout” party. 
It was both insulting to the African-
American community, and degrading 
to UCSD’s image. But the adminis-
tration’s response to this racist off-
campus event ignores one of UCSD’s 

most embarrassing, racist, on-campus 
publications: the Koala.

The Koala, notorious for its 
humorless and unintelligent satire, 
takes every opportunity to insult 
minorities of every race, religion and 
orientation. Though their offensive 
rants are largely unread and ignored, 
I must ask: Why there is a lack of out-
rage on behalf of the administration 
or the Black Student Union regarding 
the material published in the Koala?

The Koala receives its funding 
from the university through the 
Associated Students. On Feb. 15, the 
Koala submitted yet another fund-
ing request to the A.S. Council. They 
declared themselves a publication, 
type: “Tabloid, not offensive,” and 
asked for no less than $3,471.15 (All 
of this information can be found on 
the A.S. Web site). Where does this 
money come from? Tuition? Student 
fees? Who knows. Could this money 
be better spent? Absolutely.

It is hypocritical for the university 
to come down so strongly against the 
unaffiliated cookout, while simulta-

neously ignoring the racism spewed 
by the Koala, which is funded by the 
A.S. Council. The administration 
and the Black Student Union should 
regularly come down on the Koala, as 
they did in response to the cookout. 
Finally, Associated Students needs 
to cut funding to the Koala. At the 
very least, it can do this by citing the 
erroneous description of “Tabloid, 
not offensive” on the Koala funding 
request form.

OPINION� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Just as I finished out my trek to 
the Student Center, though, I found 
another tag. This one, scrawled onto 
the doors of the elevator, in the same 
red spray paint, read: “No 32%” (i.e., 
“Don’t raise our student fees by 32 
percent”). It was next to a spray-
painted advertisement for our on-
campus protest on March 4.

My immediate reaction — “Yes, 
32 percent: That’s how much more 
we’re paying.” — might have been 
cynical. But of all the things to pro-
test on this campus — racist frat 
parties, dramatically reduced course 
offerings, the recent funding freeze 
for student media — a fee hike for 
which we’ve already begun to pay 

(and that the UC Regents approved 
three months ago) sits pretty low on 
the rank of feasible targets for cur-
rent reform. 

Of course, I’m not saying that 
we should hang our heads in defeat 
and leave it at that. But expressing 
misguided anger with a can of spray 
paint on an elevator door doesn’t 
accomplish anything beyond serv-
ing as a perpetual reminder that yes, 
actually, tuition is skyrocketing — or 
if not perpetual, at least until one 
of the same underpaid UC workers 
whose rights protesters advocate is 
tasked with cleaning it off. For all 
the cans of spray paint we empty for 
the cause, until we’ve got a stabler 
stream of funding from the state, 

our ever-swelling list of TritonLink 
fees won’t be slowing down anytime 
soon.

Assuming that what results on 
March 4 isn’t merely a pissed-off 
band of student rebels who know 
little about areas of remaining 
potential for change, there’s plenty 
of opportunity to show the governor 
and the regents alike that we’re a 
force to be reckoned with — but we 
can’t very well expect to be taken 
seriously if we’re spouting the same 
old complaints. For a bit of educa-
tion, attend the teach-in today, 
Feb. 22, in Social Sciences Building 
107 at 12 p.m. with guest speaker 
Bob Samuels, President of the UC 
American Federation of Teachers.  

and tears over finding advertisers, 
especially in time to print relevant 
material. It’s another willing sacri-
fice by Gupta in a game of Daddy-
knows-best politics. (For instance, an 
informative and refreshing article on 
the California Review’s Web site will 
unfortunately receive a fraction of the 
readership it would if passed out on 
Library Walk.)

Because Gupta is aware it’s near 
impossible to seek immediate alterna-
tive funds, he therefore must be aware 
he is essentially censoring all existing 
publications. The freeze will likewise 
discourage the production of any new 
media from members of the BSU, or 
any other students in opposition to 
the Cookout and/or the Koala. 

If there’s one thing the American 
Civil Liberties Union and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Penny Rue 
(not to mention any good therapist) 
can agree on, it’s that more speech — 
not less — is most beneficial to a hurt-
ing community.

So Gupta obviously went about 
this in the worst way possible. But 
what he’s trying to show us is valuable: 
Is it really worth winning back the 
few dollars we spend on media-org 
operations we don’t agree with, when 
the price is sucking the campus dry of 
all written discussion, and endanger-
ing an environment in which students 
can express themselves freely? Not to 
mention, if the freeze were to hold, 
we wouldn’t necessarily see those dol-
lars back; it’s not like the A.S. Council 
would run a reverse referendum to 
lower student fees in accordance with 
the absence of media orgs on the 
budget. For all we know, that money 
might just melt into the giant Sun 
God pot-o’-funds.

The Koala receives about $7,000 
per year for printing. That’s about 30 
cents per student. In total, media orgs 
will receive $53,000 in 2009-10. If this 
is actually about our fees, let’s consider 
where else they’re going. Non-media 

orgs will receive $440,000. On top 
of that, “tradition events” — long-
standing org fixtures — will receive 
$105,000. KSDT Radio will receive 
$11,000. Six beer gardens will cost 
over $90,000. The Sun God Festival 
will receive $550,000 — part of which 
may be sucked up by increased secu-
rity. Perhaps, being a newspaper, we’re 
biased, but we feel journalism on cam-
pus is worth at least one-tenth of Sun 
God — even if that includes the kind 
that offends us.

Students should be equally wor-
ried if the A.S. Council — no doubt 
guided by whispers from the Campus 
Council — does find a way to cut only 
the Koala’s funds, or require all media 
content to be pre-approved, as has 
been suggested. The Koala may be an 
unpopular extreme, but depending on 
the council, the censorship threshold 
could fluctuate to include whatever 
they find unacceptable at the time. 

Isn’t it clear by now that the Koala 
makes fun of everybody? And the 
more we get our panties in a twist, the 
nastier they’re likely to fight. Content 
is often in poor taste, but it ensures 
the rest of us continue to say what we 
want. Let’s instead focus on forming 
a stronger opposing army: Ethnic-
studies departments and tutoring 
services need to be built back up, out-
reach efforts need more helping hands 
and there’s always room for more 
media orgs with minority viewpoints 
(assuming we survive the freeze). 
Heck, there’s even an affirmative-
action march on Sacramento as we 
speak, ripe for the joining.

“This is probably the decision I’m 
going to be remembered by,” Gupta 
admitted. Hell yeah, it is. He just lost 
34 voices of support across campus. 
Granted, he made the decision so 
students will understand the potential 
consequences of their angry requests 
— but that’s not worth this moment of 
silence, and neither is the jolting prec-
edent it sets: casually cork the student 
voice when things get too noisy.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2010� OPINION

In an interview with Parade maga-zine last week, Elton John — ’70s 
pop icon with a flair for sequins, 
sunglasses and all things flamboy-
ant, in case you live under a rock 
— ruffled the feathers of Christian 
leadership with a bold statement. 

“I think Jesus was a compassion-
ate, super-intelligent gay man,” he 
said.

Naturally, superimposing gay-
ness on an individual from whom 
millions of people derive their 
religious identity has gotten John 
into quite a mess. But by insisting 
on Jesus’ homosexuality, John had 
to have known he was fanning the 
flames of controversy — and so he 
got his wish. 

Think about it: While twenty- 
and thirtysomething celebrities fad-
ing from pop-culture relevance have 
the luxury of sex tapes and paparaz-
zi crotch shots at their disposal, an 
older icon such as John has but one 
avenue to grabbing headlines (other 
than death): spouting off irrelevant 
opinions on contentious issues.

Or, in this case, creating one all 
his own. 

And while 
John’s homo-
Jesus beliefs 
haven’t won him 
much right-wing 
Christian sup-
port, it’s a small 
price to pay 
for all the free 
Internet press 
he’s snagged 
along the way.   

—Trevor Cox
Opinion Editor

Though gay Jesus accusations may have netted Elton John a load of 
press, it’s certainly not his first time.  

“Instead of more violence, why 
isn’t there a meeting of religious lead-
ers?” John said in a 2006 interview 
with Music Monthly Magazine. “We 
are all God’s people; we have to get 
along and the religious leaders have 
to lead the way.”

But even if he really just wants 
peace and love, John’s done a thor-
ough job of pissing off Christian lead-
ers. He’s been an especially easy target 
for outraged bloggers, mocking him 
and citing verses from Leviticus in 
condemnation of homosexuality. “He 
should not speak on things he knows 
nothing about. Elton John’s lifestyle 
speaks for itself,” one poster wrote on 
a Fox News blog. 

It’s clear not everyone appreci-
ates John’s religious views (or power 
ballads), but many of the statements 
made in opposition to his latest athe-
istic horn-blow reveal that much of 
the Christian community is still — 
surprise, surprise — unwilling to just 
get along. So, regardless to what he 

thinks about 
Jesus’ sexual 
preferences, 
if it’s really 
religious unity 
and peace 
John is after, 
alienating 
the Christian 
community 
isn’t the wisest 
place to start.

NEWS� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

Steve Montiel, a spokesman for the 
University of California Office of the 
President, it is too early in the lawsuit 
to reopen the discussion of affirmative 
action. He said the university will con-
sider reinstating affirmative action in 
the future, if the lawsuit is successful. 

“If this opens up another discus-
sion, that’s well and good, but as long 
as Prop.osition 209 is the law, we’re 
obliged to follow it,” Montiel said.

According to Ronald Cruz, a 
prosecuting lawyer with Scheff, 
Washington & Driver, P.C., the poli-
cies put in place by Prop.. 209 lead to 
segregated universities.

“The experience of California 
has proven that this is just an unten-
able social policy, because one of the 
results is that the UC system — after 
trying everything, including con-
sidering socioeconomic class — has 
not increased the number of black, 
Latino or Native-American students 
in the campuses,” Cruz said. “And 
at many UC campuses, there is a 
permanent de facto segregation as a 
direct result of Prop.osition 209.”

Opponents of affirmative action 
have argued that standardized tests 

like the SAT, alongside GPAs, pro-
vide an even playing field by which 
colleges can judge all applications. 
Felarca also said that opponents of 
affirmative action often believe that 
if students are accepted to a univer-
sity based on a combination of race 
and academic achievement, they may 
be less equipped to handle their cho-
sen college’s curriculum.

According to Felarca, these argu-
ments are unjustified, and perpetuate 
low representation of minorities at 
California’s public universities.

“The criteria that opponents of 
affirmative action try to use to justify 
the exclusion of black and Latino and 
Native-Americans — and also poor 
students of all races — are completely 
biased and racist,” Felarca said. “[The 
SAT exams] are not accurate mea-
sures or objective measures of their 
intelligence. And, of course, grade-
point averages are so subjective, and 
so weighted in favor of students who 
have had more access to AP classes 
and honors classes. And that isn’t the 
reality of the state of California — 
that all students have equal access.”

According to Cruz, the legal climate 
has changed significantly in BAMN’s 

favor since Prop. 209 passed in 1996. 
The 2003 Supreme Court case Grutter 
v. Bollinger declared on a federal level 
that affirmative action was not only 
legal, but also necessary to reverse 
racial injustices. This set a clear prec-
edent, Cruz said, in favor of affirmative 
action, though the decision did not 
mandate that states adopt the policy.

“The Supreme Court said that 
these measures are completely con-
stitutional and, on top of that, serve a 
national interest,” Cruz said. 

In addition, the strength of the 
new student movement that protest-
ed the 32-percent fee hikes helped 
convince BAMN that now was the 
time to file this lawsuit, Felarca said.

“The student movement that has 
been built on the campuses — espe-
cially in the past semester, around 
defending public education, and 
higher education, and against the fee 
hikes and budget cuts — has com-
pletely strengthened the possibilities 
of winning,” Felarca said. “In the end, 
this lawsuit is an extension of that 
movement.”

In 2009, A.S. Concerts and Events 

put on “nooner concerts” — midday 
performances by less-popular open-
ing bands in Price Center — and 
other activities throughout campus 
during the week leading up to the Sun 
God Festival. However, on the actual 
day of the festival, all council-funded 
events and programming took place 
on RIMAC Field. 

According to Bramwell, the A.S. 
Council hopes that allocating a small 
fraction of its $550,000 Sun-God 
budget to the individual colleges may 
help spread the Sun God Festival to 

other parts of the campus.
“We are really trying to focus 

on the event itself on RIMAC 
Field, but there will be other A.S.-
endorsed events, like the Junkyard 
Derby, which we are excited about,” 
Bramwell said at the open forum. 
“There are also going to be college-
specific events that A.S. has agreed 
to subsidize, but not necessarily have 
their hands in programming.”

Chirco said the “uncaging” could 
have a positive impact on the festival.

“Honestly, I think it’s a good idea,” 
he said. “I’d like to see more college-
council participation. Obviously, it’s 
going to need a lot of refinements. It’s 

the first year since Sun God has been 
caged that it’s going to be uncaged, so 
we’re taking baby steps.”

Bramwell also discussed effective 
wristband distribution methods, in 
response to student upset over long 
lines in 2009. Although no final deci-
sion has been made on the matter, 
Bramwell proposed that half of the 
roughly 16,500 student wristbands 
be handed out on the Thursday after-
noon before the event, and the rest 
be distributed on the morning of the 
festival.

In addition, Associate Vice Chancellor of Admissions Mae 
Brown has already established a pilot admissions program

“All violations of the Student Code of Conduct will be vig-
orously pursued and appropriate discipline will be imposed 
in accordance with our policies,” Fox said in a statement.

Members of the BSU refused to comment.  

SRTV SHUTDOWN
Gupta responded to the offensive broadcast by imme-

diately revoking SRTV’s charter at 11:30 p.m. on Thursday 
night. 

The station has a turbulent history — especially where the 
Koala is concerned. In 2005, it was shut down after former 
Koala editor in chief Steve York aired a recording of himself 
having sex with an adult-film actress, garnering national 
media attention and prompting a heated debate over free 
speech. 

Since its most recent relaunch earlier this quarter, SRTV 
has aired 10 episodes of the show “Will It Chop,” as well 
as “Cooking With Dr. D,” “Beatendo,” “Home Suite Home” 

and “DVC Fridays,” along with a single airing of “Gupta 
Answers.” Between broadcasts, the station loops five 

hours of old content — such as past FallFests and 
concerts — and had planned to start streaming 

online by Spring Quarter.
Gupta said that SRTV’s charter has 
been revoked indefinitely. The station’s 

future will be discussed at a public 
committee meeting set for later 
this week  — the same one that 
will discuss the future of media 
organizations on campus, and 
rewrite guidelines for appro-
priate use of A.S. Council fis-
cal allocations.

“The committee is [a] 
good tool for us to work out 

and work with the student 
body on what they like to see 

done with their student fees,” 
Gupta said.  

He stressed that the station was not 
shut down solely due to Thursday night’s 

content, but also because Koala TV had 
not completed the necessary paperwork to 

broadcast on the station  — which gave him the 
authority to revoke the station’s charter imme-

diately.
“The fact that the content was so intolerant and 

insensitive prompted us to review how it was on SRTV 
in the first place,” he said.  

Under SRTV’s new charter, any group wishing to 
broadcast a program must complete paperwork and receive 

signatures of approval from both station managers: Dadourian 
and Ali Haidan. The Koala did not have Haidan’s signature.

“Basically, their show is illegitimate, which is another rea-
son why SRTV was shut down, because they lied about that,” 
Dadourian said.

Dadourian said that he and Haidan were in charge of the 
paperwork, but had been unable to regulate it carefully due 
to busy schedules. He added that he had trusted the Koala 
because members of the publication had been extremely help-
ful in helping SRTV relaunch.

“Another reason why I took Koala in such good faith is 
they basically rewired the studio for us,” he said. “I don’t think 
SRTV would’ve been in function had Kris Gregorian not 
rewired the entire studio. The efficiency with which they did it 
was amazing and incredible, and we really needed it. And he’s 
been the best tech person we’ve ever had.”

Gupta admitted that the rules of the charter were unclear. 
In fact, his own show, “Gupta Answers,” broached it as well.

According to Dadourian, there is technically nothing in the 
standing rules that prevents racially charged content. 

“When it comes to things like racial issues, there’s kind of a 
gray line there,” he said. “After 10 o’clock ... if HBO would show 
it, that means it’s OK. It’s hard to judge when it’s a good time to 
shut down a program, especially when it comes to race.”

Dadourian projected the station will lose its ability to 
broadcast live, which he said is “the most important part of the 
station.”

“We’re going to lose all access to live shows  — or if we do 
do live shows, then what will end up happening is there’ll be 
the late-night shows,” he said. “We won’t be able to have people 
call in or anything like that. [And what’s worse] is that we 
spent thousands of dollars on equipment to allow us to do this 
stuff, and it’s all just going to go to waste because we can’t do 
live shows anymore.”

Dadourian said the university is concerned with the ramifi-
cations of live programming.

 “The thing with live programming is it can go from a PG 
to a NC-17 in a matter of seconds, and it’s already too late,” he 
said.

Gupta said the option of using only prerecorded material 
will be discussed by the public committee — which he said is 
not meant to be a content review board.  

“I hope the administration doesn’t get involved in any sort 
of content regulation,” he said. “The purpose of the commit-
tee is to review how A.S. reviews funding and how it sponsors 
programs on our campus TV network, on our student TV.”

Dadourian said he has since received five death threats 
through the SRTV call-in feature. It is ironic, he added, for 
students to both call for an end to hate speech on campus and 
simultaneously issue death threats.

According to Dadourian, the BSU has not responded to his 
invitations to air their opinions on SRTV. Until SRTV reopens, 
he is posting footage under the Web site www.trtvucsd.com. 

“As much as I love free speech, my primary goal is to get 
the television station ready to go,” he said. “There’s good con-
tent we produce that is not racially charged and not pushing 
the envelopes. ... We let [the Koala] get away with their name, 
but I don’t think Koala TV will ever be airing on SRTV again.”

BIG FREEZE
In addition to revoking the charter of the newly launched 

SRTV, Gupta has used his executive powers to freeze all 
student-media funding, pending discussion by the campus 
committee this Thursday or Friday (he is currently trying to 
reserve a room). This quarter, 14 media organizations have 
requested funding from the council. Gregorian submitted 
a funding request of $3,471.15 from the council in order to  
fund the Koala’s publishing costs.  

Gupta said he implemented the funding freeze in order 
to bring media organizations and protestors together at 
the meeting — to create a campuswide dialogue about free 
speech, student fees and funding. 

“When the players of a game start to get hurt, you need to 
press pause,” he said.

According to A.S. Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch, this freeze on student funding will 

last until the campuswide committee can decide on new 
language and criteria for the funding of student media orga-
nizations. 

Benesch said that the freeze was not a new idea caused 
by the SRTV incident, but had long been discussed by the 
council.

“We had been considering this before,” he said. “There’s 
always been the problem that A.S. is using student fees to 
fund what many consider hate speech.”

Benesch said the council is seeking legal counsel on how 
to define hate speech. He gave the example of the California 
Review — a conservative campus newspaper that recently 
published a cartoon depicting a Muslim “underwear bomber” 
— as a publication some have called hateful.

“The criteria for hate speech is tricky, and that’s one of the 
things the campuswide committee hopes to address,” he said. 
“We want to make absolutely sure that we are not funding 
hate speech.”

California Review Editor in Chief Alec Weisman said his 
paper — which is entirely funded by the A.S. Council — will 
feel a strong impact from this freeze, and that it will hinder 
the paper’s production process.

“This will create a large damper on productivity,” 
Weisman said. “We were planning on distributing an issue 
during ninth week, but it looks like that won’t happen.”

Weisman said that if the freeze continues, the paper might 
be forced to move online or seek funding from external 
sources. 

“A.S. is definitely overreacting,” he said. “This is getting 
out of hand, and they’re looking for an excuse to shut down 
free speech, which the school has tried to do for years. The 
school is taking it to extremes.”

Gupta said that if the committee decides to change media 
guidelines, he will put a referendum up for vote on the 
Spring Quarter election ballot.

“I don’t think this is a decision that should just go 
through A.S.,” he said. “If students recommend these chang-
es, I want the student body to be able to decide on it as well.”

However, Gupta said he hopes the committee will address 
the funding freeze at the first meeting, so that media orga-
nizations can have their funding reinstated as soon as pos-
sible — and then continue to discuss policy change at greater 
length.

Rose Eveleth, editor in chief of Mania Magazine, said 
“mass censorship” is the wrong way to deal with hate speech. 
She said she is seeking counsel from the Student Press Law 
Center as to the media organization’s legal options. 

“I understand the pressure that Utsav is under since he 
can’t legally cut off the Koala, but this freeze is definitely 
not the answer,” Eveleth said.“Many of us were planning to 
express our outrage over this incidence, and now we can’t 
even do that. This is detrimental, to not let student express 
themselves, especially since we have a diverse array of view-
points that are being suppressed.”

Although Gupta said he hopes to reverse the funding 
freeze by the end of the week, Eveleth said Associate Vice 
President of Student Organizations Andrew Ang told her it’s 
likely the issue won’t be settled until Spring Quarter.

“I’m not one to have faith about the power of committees 
in this case,” Eveleth said. “When there’s a lot of angry people 
getting together to talk about something, good decisions 
don’t get made. It’s going to turn into a yelling match.”

Benesch responded to allegations that the A.S. Council is 
shutting down free speech.

“This is not an issue of ‘punish-
ing’ media organizations, although 
we realize that this moratorium will 
be difficult for them,” he said. “This 
is just a realization that we need 
to take steps before we continue to 
fund them.”

Eveleth said she will be work-
ing to secure alternative funding for 
Mania Magazine as long as the freeze 
remains.

CRUEL INTENTIONS?
According to Gregorian, the 

comments he made on SRTV were 
intended to provoke more discussion 
on the issue. 

“Sure, what I said taken out of 
context may be seen as horrible,” he 
said. “But you have to understand 
that it’s in the context of trying 
to raise the debate, trying to raise 
awareness. Right now, there’s only 
one side of the issue — it’s just BSU 
yelling at us. There is another side of 

the issue, which is that everyone is 
overreacting.”

In another act of opposition, 
Sixth College senior Mike Randazzo 
is hosting a “Compton Cookout Part 
Deux: Equal Rights” party on March 
4. He is requesting that guests come 
dressed as their favorite stereotype, 
which he said will promote free 
speech and show that the inten-
tions of the original Cookout were 
innocent. Currently, 120 people have 
RSVPed as attending.

“I created this event to get people 
to understand that the creators 
meant no ill will,” Randazzo said. 
“It’s wrong that people are getting 
outraged, and I want to help people 

come together and put an end to the 
hatred to show that UCSD is not a 
racist place.”

Randazzo said he thinks the orig-
inal Cookout crossed a line, but that 
it raised a cultural, not racial, issue.

“It’s important to make the dis-
tinction that the party was talking 
about a culture, and not all black 
people are part of this culture, and 
the act of bringing stereotypes to life 
is completely innocuous,” he said. 
“People who are part of a culture like 
this obviously choose to remain part 
of the culture, because otherwise 
they would immigrate to another 
one.”

Warren College senior Lisa Vilitz, 

who created a Facebook group 
called “UCSD Students Outraged 
That People Are Outraged About 
the Compton Cookout,” agreed that 
the event wasn’t created with racist 
intentions, and said that the reaction 
was excessive.  

“People are saying that the people 
who join my group are racist, which 
is absolutely ridiculous,” Vilitz said. 
“Nobody thinks that black people 
are actually like that — the party 
was just satirical. I cannot under-
stand how people are outraged at the 
Cookout, and yet they are not pro-
testing MTV, Tyler Perry or rap.”

FOCUS� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Vilitz added that the BSU list of 
demands is unwarranted in light of 
state budget and faculty cuts.  

“I think that this is an overreac-
tion, because we live in a society 
where people passively ignore the 
real-life violence that we hear about 
on the news every day, yet when 
something that may be considered 
“offensive” occurs, the entire nation 
is on fire,” she said. 

MY RIGHTS VS. YOURS 
Faculty members, the BSU and 

even state legislators have publicly 
condemned both the original event 
and the comments made on SRTV. 

Associate professer of ethnic stud-
ies Kaplan praised the A.S. Council’s 
decision to shut down SRTV and 
freeze media funding.

“My initial thoughts are that — 
first of all — it’s absolutely appalling,” 
Kaplan said. “It’s an egregious misuse 
of campus resources to spread these 
kinds of deeply insulting and degrad-
ing ideas and messages and images.”

She criticized administrators for 
their initial “tepid” response to the 
Cookout.

“I think that whether it intended 
to or not, it gave passive permission 
students to continue to escalate into 
increasingly violent speech and lan-
guage towards African-Americans,” 
Kaplan said. “And that’s exactly what 
happened.”

She said the administration’s 
e-mailed responses were more con-
cerned with covering campus liability 
than addressing the larger issue of a 
negative campus climate.

“I think that the initial response 
was so focused on issues of legality, 
policy and liability, that it really failed 
to make clear what I think they’ve 
made more clear now: the administra-
tion’s strong commitment to changing 
campus climate, and their responsibil-
ity for doing so,” she said. 

She fears that recruiting black stu-
dents to apply and attend UCSD could 
nonetheless become more difficult, 
as it now has the association of being 
a “racist” campus. However, Kaplan 
applauded the administration’s latest 
actions in showing themselves to be 
more committed to fixing the situa-

tion — especially with the pilot imple-
mentation of holistic review.

“Discourses, ideas, representations 
have the power to wound, are an act 
of violence in their own right, and 
they incite physical and material vio-
lence,” Kaplan said.

Literature professor and director 
of Chicano/a and Latino/a studies 
Jorge Mariscal — alongside Office of 
Academic Support and Instructional 
Services Director Patrick Velasquez 
— called on the administration to 
provide increased funding and staff-
ing for the African-American studies 
minor (which the Chancellor has 
since promised) and create an office 
in which to address campus climate.

Mariscal said that UCSD Chicano 
Concillo had asked the chancellor to 
establish a task force to improve the 
campus climate four years ago.

“In 2006, we thought the climate 
was a ticking time bomb with regard 
to how uncomfortable it makes black 
and Chicano students feel,” Mariscal 
said. “Our request was never followed 
up on by the administration, and now 
we have the current crisis.”

Marshall College freshman and 
BSU member Grant White made an 
impromptu presentation in his fresh-
man Dimensions of Culture class on 
Friday morning. White said he should 
not have to listen to hateful comments.

“I’m not saying that they don’t 
have the right to freedom of speech, 
but where’s my right to be protected 
from that?” White asked. “I am a 
student in your class, and I have to 
sit next to these racist kids. What 
kind of college is this?”

The events at UCSD have 
received attention from state law-
makers. According to Terry Schanz, 
press secretary to Assemblyman 
Isadore Hall (D-Compton), Hall is 
calling for a resolution condemning 
the actions of the students, an inves-
tigation into UCSD fraternities and 
for the charter of those fraternities to 
be revoked.

Schanz said that Hall is attempt-
ing to obtain a recording of SRTV’s 
Thursday-night broadcast.

“We’d love to get a hold of the 
tape,” Schanz said. “That’s a game-
changer in terms of the actions that 
we will pursue.”

COUNCIL RESPONSE
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 

Pena has already chartered an A.S. 
committee to draft a resolution 
concerning campus climate. He said 
the committee would try to inspire 
leaders to come up with ideas for 
improving the climate and create a 
list of demands. Although there has 
been no official forum created by the 
committee thus far, Pena said Greek 
fraternity members have already met 
with several members of the BSU.

“We don’t want to attack the 
Greek community, and we don’t 
want to focus on individuals and 
these incidents of racism,” Pena 
said. “This is all just a symptom of a 
larger disease that has always been 
present and that we need to fight.” 

He encouraged people to par-
ticipate in the March 4 Day of Public 
Education walkout, to protest and 
fight for equal-access education for all.

ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION
According to Vice Chancellor of 

Student Affairs Penny Rue, both she 
and Fox met with members of the BSU 
on Friday to work on outreach efforts.

Rue has charged the Director of 
Student Policy and Judicial Affairs, 
Tony Valladolid, with leading the 
investigation of the students who 
planned the Cookout. The investiga-
tive process, which includes inter-
views of suspected persons involved, 
began Tuesday morning.  

Rue said party planners are being 
investigated for potential violations to 
the Student Code of Conduct. Section 
22.16.10.24 defines harassment as the 
use of gestures or imagery that creates 
a hostile environment on campus.  

Another potential violation the 
university is investigating is section 
22.16.10.15, which condemns unlaw-
ful or unauthorized use of any uni-
versity property. 

Possible sanctions of these 
breaches range from a letter of cen-
sure to expulsion from the univer-
sity. However, Rue said the investiga-
tion has not yet concluded.

rebounds leading to 15 second-
chance points. The Otters outscored 
the Tritons 24-16 in the paint, with 
a 13-1 advantage in the second half. 

The Tritons went cold from the 
field in the second half, converting 
only eight of their 23 shots. They 
fell to 22-3 overall and 17-3 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 

Association. All of UCSD’s losses 
have come on the road. 

The loss came one night after 
besting San Francisco State in a 
hard-fought 58-50 victory on Friday. 
Carlisle led all scorers with 14 points, 
while senior guard Annette Ilg added 
12 points and Hunter followed up 
with 11 points and nine boards. The 
Tritons swept the season series with 

San Francisco for the win. 
UCSD will host their final two 

games of the regular season against 
Sonoma State and Humboldt State 
at RIMAC Arena. Sonoma hits the 
court first, on Wednesday at 5:30 
p.m.

Readers can contact Liam Rose at 
lfrose@ucsd.edu.

finish the season strong.
“We have to come out with 

intensity these last two games,” 
Lawley said. “We tend to drop off, 
and we need to step up on the 
defensive end.”

The Tritons have two games left 
in the regular season. They play 
against Sonoma State University on 
Feb. 24 and against Humboldt State 

University on Feb. 26. Both games 
will be held at 7:30 p.m. at RIMAC 
arena.  UCSD lost at Humboldt State 
74-60 and at Sonoma State 78-66 in 
its meetings with both teams earlier 
this season.  

The Tritons have made the 
playoffs each of the last two seasons.

The Tritons placed especially well 
in the sprinting events, winning the 
100-meter, 400-meter and 4x100 
races. Sophomores Dan Nguyen and 
Tobi Haswell won the 100-meter and 
400-meter races respectively, and 
were joined by senior Will Dyer and 
freshman Erik Frost on the winning 
relay team. 

Sophomore Nick Howe — the 
reigning California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Freshman of the 
Year — easily won the javelin throw 
with his mark of 188’10.”

Even though the meet was 
successful for both squads, Salerno 
said he still sees room for growth.

“They were pretty nervous, and 

a lot of it was that the expectations 
were so high for both the men and 
women,” said Salerno. “I think that 
the athletes that underachieved were 
just having early season jitters.”

Salerno said he has high 
expectations for the team this season.

“On the men’s side, it’s to win the 
conference, and that’s going to require 
beating Chico,” he said. “For the 
women, it’s to win our sixth straight 
conference title. It’s always harder to 
stay on top than it is to get there.

The Tritons will travel to UC 
Irvine this Saturday to compete in 
the All-Cal Championships.

singles matches.
Junior Taskeen Bains, who earned 

Penn/CCAA Player of the Week 
honors on Feb. 8, took control in the 
first singles match, winning 6-1 and 
6-0. Sophomore Katie Mulloy also 
won 6-1, 6-1 in straight sets. 

After dismantling Sonoma, 
the Tritons traveled to Turlock on 
Feb. 20 and succeeded in upsetting 
Stanilaus. 

The match was a true show of the 
team’s ability to come from behind. 
Down 2-4 in the tie after losing two 
of three doubles matches, the Tritons 
aggressively struck back, winning 
the last three singles matches — with 
Juniors Cindy Dao and Valerie Tang 
and sophomore Katie Milloy leading 
the rally.

Dao and Tang both rebounded to 
win their singles matches after losing 
in doubles play earlier in the day. 

“We didn’t have a good start in 
doubles, but our coach just moti-
vated us to try harder since we are 
better in singles,” Tang said. “We 
both had the desire to win, and since 
we hadn’t lost in so long, we wanted 
to keep that record going.” 

Mulloy’s dramatic triumph at 
No. 5 singles earned the Tritons the 
victory in a tense three-set match. 
With the matchup evened at four 
wins apiece, Mulloy persevered for a 
third-set victory 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.

The wins to Sonoma and 

Stanislaus continued the impressive 
Triton conference winning streak 
from seasons past, bringing UCSD 
to 62 straight wins in the CCAA.

“We are focused on getting wins 
and beating teams,” LaPlante said. 
“We’re matching the girls up with 
stronger teams to beat.”

The Tritons’ last stop was Davis, 
where they played an out-of-confer-
ence matchup against the Division-I 
Aggies. Despite their best efforts, the 
Tritons lost 0-9.

“This was a wakeup call for us,” 
Tang said. “We know we are capable 
of more, and we know what we need 

to get done.”
After the loss to Davis, LaPlante 

said the Tritons are ready to get 
ahead on the court in their next 
two matches against Fresno Pacific 
University, currently ranked No. 
2 in the National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics. UCSD will 
host the Feb. 26 match. 

“We know what we need to work 
on, [and] have identified strengths 
and weaknesses to have more pro-
ductive practices,” LaPlante said.

Whitney Johnson in 2008.

The junior long-jumper dominated at a four-way meet 
on Feb. 20 at Triton Field. She won her event by over a 
foot, with a leap of 19’10.75” — earning her an automatic 
bid to the NCAA Regionals in May.

TRACK & FIELD — The Tritons 
started their season strong at a 
home meet against San Diego 
State, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal 
State Dominguez Hills and 
Clairemont-Mudd-Scripps on 
Feb. 20. The team claimed victo-
ry on both the men and women’s 
sides of the competition — the 
men totaled 152 points, and the 
women 213.

UCSD athletes hit 10 marks 
that were either provisional or 
automatic qualifying marks for 
the NCAA Division-II Regional 
Championships.

“We were pretty scared,” head 
coach Tony Salerno said. “We 
were third in the nation last year, 
but we graduated some and we 
are redshirting some. We were 
amazed at how many qualifiers we 

had for the first meet of the year.”
Some of last year’s best 

female performers continued 
to shine, getting the season off 
to an encouraging start. Junior 
Stephanie LeFever had an 
outstanding day, tying the school 
record in the long jump with her 
mark of 6.06 meters. She also 
placed second in the 100-meter 
hurdles, and fifth in the javelin 
throw. 

Seniors Christine Merrill 
and Linda Rainwater — both 
defending national champions  
— dominated their respective 
events. Merrill won both the 
400- and 100-meter hurdles, and 
Rainwater placed first in the high 
jump. Rainwater also finished 
third in the javelin, fourth in the 
100-meter hurdles and ran on 
the winning 4x400 relay team.

Junior Kelly Fogarty led the 
way for the sprinters, placing first 

in both the 100-meter dash with 
a time of 11.92 seconds and the 
200-meter dash with a time of 
24.78 seconds. Her performance 
in the 100-meter barely missed 
beating her own record of 11.85 
seconds.

In the throwing events, junior 
Theresa Richards set a personal 
best in the javelin throw with 
a mark of 136’3”, winning the 
event by nearly 10 feet. Senior 
Marie Archer easily won the 
hammer throw and placed third 
in the discus throw.

On the men’s side, reigning 
conference champion and senior 
Leon Baham won both the 110- 
and 400-meter hurdles, and 
anchored the Tritons’ 4x400 relay 
team. Baham’s time of 53.67 in the 
400-meter hurdles met the NCAA 
provisional qualifying time.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD 
turned in a solid performance last 
Feb. 16, beating Cal State East Bay 
67-48. They then saw a split road trip 
over the weekend, losing 61-50 to San 
Francisco State and beating Cal State 
Monterey Bay 78-74. 

The Tritons, led by senior guard 
Tyler Acevedo and his season-high 19 
points, comfortably defeated the Cal 
State East Bay by 19 points in RIMAC 
Arena. Sophomore center Christian 
Hatch contributed a double-double 
of his own — 12 points and 10 
rebounds — to help lead the Tritons 
to their sixth conference win of the 
season. Hatch nailed big free throws 
throughout the game, hitting eight of 
10 from the line. 

Defense was once again key, as 
the Tritons held Cal State East Bay 
to 28 percent shooting and matched 
a season-best defensive effort set last 
week by holding the Pioneers to only 
48 points. 

After a confident win at home, 
the UCSD men traveled to San 
Francisco, hoping for a successful 
road trip the second week in a row. 
However, the Tritons couldn’t close 
in on the Gators after a tight score 
of 27-28 at halftime. San Francisco 
went on an 8-2 run with 12 minutes 
to go in the game, leaving the Tritons 
behind.

After suffering the loss to San 
Francisco on Friday, UCSD revved 
up play Cal State Monterey Bay on 

Saturday night. 
Though tired, the 
men were able to 
edge out the Otters 
for a four-point 
victory. 

Recently, the 
Tritons have 
struggled with back-
to-back road games. 
However, leading 
scorer and guard 
Jordan Lawley took 
it upon himself 
Saturday to heave 
the team to victory 
with 28 points. 
Hatch also had a 
great game, scoring 
17 points and 
shooting a perfect 
five-of-five from the 
free-throw line. Off 
the bench, freshman 
forward Justin Brue 
was a huge help, 
contributing six 
points in only 17 
minutes of play.

“It was their senior night,” Lawley 
said. “They had the competitive edge 
and we wanted to take it from them.” 

Head coach Chris Carlson said he 
was pleased with the performance by 
Lawley, as well as the rest of the team. 
As a group that often struggles in the 
second half, he said it was important 
for the players to hold strong toward 
the end.

“Execution was good,” he 
said. “The boys showed a lot of 
perseverance and mental toughness 
in the second half.”

In order to make it to the playoffs, 
the Tritons must win their final two 
games of the regular season this 
weekend. As a senior and the team’s 
leading scorer, Lawley has assumed a 
leadership role. He said the team will 
need to maintain defensive ferocity to

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons were upstaged by the playoff-
bound Cal State Monterey Bay Otters 
on Feb. 20. The Otters handed UCSD 
its mere third loss of the season — 
but the second in its past four games 
— by a 68-57 decision. 

Outscoring UCSD 16-4 in the last 
3:15 of the game, the Otters used a 
late surge to down the Tritons. 

Junior forward Tiffany Hunter 
led the team with 18 points and nine 
rebounds, while sophomore guard 
Chelsea Carlisle added 17 points and 
four rebounds. 

Head coach Charity Elliott said 
she sees no particular trend in the 
Tritons’ recent troubles. 

“We’ve just had a couple of tough 
games, and we just haven’t met the 
intensity and focus of our opponent,” 
head coach Charity Elliott said.  

The Otters’ win came a day after  
they beat Cal State East Bay to clinch 
their first-ever berth to the CCAA 
tournament. The Otters had never 
before beaten the Tritons. Head 
coach Renee Jimenez called the win 
over UCSD “without a doubt the 
biggest win in program history.”

UCSD trailed by a point at 
halftime, but CSUMB’s Lindsay 
Trout’s fourth three-pointer of the 
game gave the Otters a seven-point 
advantage at five minutes into the 
second half. 

Though the Tritons were able to 
rally — and held a narrow 53-52 lead 
with 3:39 remaining — the Otters 
hit five of six free throws in the final 
minute to seal the win.

Cal State Monterey Bay was also 
able to take a 43-32 advantage in 
rebounding, including 14 offensive

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The UCSD 
women’s tennis team stayed undefeat-
ed against conference opposition in its 

first road trip of the season from Feb. 
19 to Feb. 21 — bringing its record 
to 62 straight wins in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, and 
establishing itself as the pre-eminent 
Division-II title contender.

The No. 19 nationally ranked 
Tritons defeated CCAA foes No. 
44 Sonoma State and No. 17 Cal 
State Stanislaus before losing to con-
ference opponent UC Davis. The 

matches brought UCSD to 3-1 on the 
season and 3-0 in the CCAA.

Going into the weekend, head 
coach Liz LaPlante said she was 
unsure of how well the team would 
do, especially after matches were 
canceled due to rain earlier in the 
season.

“It was a little scary, but the lineup 
for these matches provided the level 
of competition we needed,” LaPlante 

said. “It builds up our confidence to 
play against other teams in CCAA 
such as Cal State LA and Cal Poly 
Pomona.” 

UCSD’s first stop was at Rohnert 
Park against Sonoma State on Feb. 
19, where it won decisively 8-1. The 
Tritons won three of three doubles 
matches and lost only one of six 

Women’s tennis goes 2-1 
in Northern California
over the weekend.
