Athletic funding won't 
injure academic status 

By PETER MORTENSEN 
It would be easy for me to 

ay that ucsn does not need 
to committ any more money to 
intercollegiate athletic. After 
all, it is a pret ty small percen· 
tage of the whole tudent body 
that makes up the member of 
participants and spectators of 
the 28 intercollegiate team 
here. 

But. at a school where 
apat hy reigns, I've come to the 
conclusion that you ca n't fund 
acti vit ies that will benefit a 
majority of the student popula· 
tions because the majorit y of 
the student population simpl} 
doesn 't care about anythmg 
aSide from classes, if that. 

And for t hose who are wor· 
ried that a fe\\' thou!-.and more 
dollars are going to turn UCSD 
into an athletic Ixw.:erhouse, 
thus hurtmg its academic rep· 
utation, think again. It would 
take a quantum leap In fund-
Ing for t hat to ever happen and 
I know the Registration Fee 
comnlltteeand theadmini.tra-
tion don't have this written 
Into the big game plan . 

:wartmore College IS ha\'-
ing a similar problem at a more 
advanced state. Their footba ll 
team IS haVing a phenomenal 

~eason , and the faculty and 
academic staff are afraid that 
this will cheapen t he school\, 
fl ne academiC repu t atJon as 

has happened to, say USC. 
UCSD is very far from even 

Swarthmore, though . Like I 
aid. I'm ure a few more thou-

sand dollars to keep the 
coache at ba ic subsistnece 
level is not going to bring aca-
demics at UCSD tumbling to 
the ground . Modes t pride and 
modest fu nding for athletics 
cannot do anything but raise 
the level of student JI1volve-
ment here. 

One thing that doe concern 
me, though, is ~ome student 
athletes ' attitudes about the 
situation. I'\'e read many of 
the letters that ha\e poured 
into the Guardiall office and a 
disturbing number are 
demanding more money for 
t heir team~. 

Now, I can understand \\ hy 
t hey are u p~et. bu t I don't see 
the need to demand. DespIte 
\\ hat many people mIght 
think, It wouldn't be impo~si " 
ble for the Reg Fee to recom-
mend a funding l'Ut or 
elimination. That's not to ..,a,· 
that they would ever do thiS, 
but I think it'.., wl~e to 
remember thaI it won't doam 
good to inf.Jriate the pcople 
holdmg the purse :-;trmgs. 

It's good to sec people get -
ting excIted aboul somelhing, 
anything Even If ~tudent ath-

Social Security is dead and 
causes anguish for its victims 

By COT RHOAD 
Bury the rotting corpse of 

socia l security before its 
stench becomes any more 
unbearable. Social security is 
dead, it has an es tImated 
trillion dollars in I ia bilit ies 
and no, count 'em, no as~et s. 
The ~\'st em ~h a ll not last 
much - longer. We should 
eliminate it as S(X)n as possible 
to minImize the anguIsh of it~ 
\·ictims. 

ocial serurit \ started a:-. a 
noble \'enture' to provide 
workers \\It h an assured 
Income in their ret iremen t. 
The IX'()ple entrusted It to the 
go\('rnment because I hey felt 
that they could not lean' such 
an Importanl program 
\ ulnerabil' to the whim of 
greed) bUSiness men or 
vicissit udes of I he economy 
Why ... hould we destroy such-a 
wonderful plan? It already has 
been dest ro\ l'd! Tho..,e 
honorable men i'n Washington 
ha\'e robbed the social s{'curitv 
till, defrauded the people of the 
funds that they \\erl:' supposed 
to save for the future, and they 
ha\e used the mone\ for the;'r 
m\'n abortive Great SOCle!} 

programs and to line the 
pockets of cert ain privileged 
gentlemen. 

Social securit v is now a 
bucket shop -' a system in 
whIch the con art ist sells 
securities and pays ret urns on 
them by sel lin g more 
securities. pocketing Ihe 
difference. Such a "'"stem 
collapses \\' hen t here are no 
longer enough buyers to 
SUPIX)rl (he growi ng mterest 
payments_ This is a \·t'r~ 
common scam which take ... 
man} forms and It's Illegal as 
hell when anyone but the 
govern men t does it. 

But even if the poll ( IClan~ 
are ne\er held accountable for 
their fraud, their bucket shop 
\.,.dllast fore\·er. It has alr('ad., 
startt'<i breaking down due t(l, 
the aging populatIOn. There 
ar(' not enough workers to 
support all of the liabilltie .... 
We should, therefore. disband 
the system. 

What happens to t he poor 
elderly people who trustL'<i 
their leaders to fu lfill their 
promise.? They are (to use the 
\ ernacu lar) screwed mto the 
dirt. They wi ll ha\'e 10 relv on 

t he privat e sector 10 survive -
.;:harity - much a man y of 
them are doing right now. 
Thi" is a painful. frightening 
prospect which is especia lly 
hard for t he elderly to face. 
That is w hy they and those 
who empathize with them 
WIsh to maintain the bucket 
shop and .,crew just one more 
generation out of their hard 
earned mone\ , 

But soon this generation of 
e1derl\, or t he next. or may be 
the n-ext. \\111 fmd that the 
money "'Imply isn't there. The 
bucket shop \\ ill t hen come 
crashing down, lea\'mg much

enmities whlt'h wdl last for

AS meets: decision tnade about beer at TG

not receive the two·thirds 
COllncil approval necessary 
for adoption a an amendmen t. 

Geiger next introduced a 
motion to " redistribute $9,000 
from the programming budget, 
TG fund , inlo a pecial TG 
fund t o b e o r g ani zed , 
controlled, and spent by a 
special TG programmer wi th 
budget expenditure approval 
bv the A Council. " Geiger 
a l so reco mm e nd e d t he 
select ion of former Program· 
mi ng Director Adam Forest to 
head the "special TG Fu nd." 

Programming Commi~s lon 
er Da\'id Parker remarked. "If 
the Council feels It's 
Important to do. then 
obnousl\, that's what has to 
be done· ... ·1 am planning on 
hanng TGs and TGs With 
beer ." planning on addtng 
more TGs \vithout beer and I 
am not plann Il1g on stopping 
TGs," 

Geiger explatned, "This 
motion is made not to cause 
frictIOn, but to better the 
students" Personal"', [ don't 
think I )a\'e does a goZ)d Job (on 
TGs) .. becausehl'iheart'snot 
111 it." 

Muir College Representat I\,e 
Stephen Haskins noted, 
" .. there is an interest in 
Council to tr\', at least. to ha\'e 
'ome TLs (\'Il h alcohol and 
some Without .. It Isn't as 
though the tremendous 
majority of the Council is for 
ha\'ing all TGs \\ Ith alcohol." 

(;eiger responded, " I thtnk 
the Counci l has become really 
concerned wit h what's gOtng 
to affect t he Council and not 

with what' s going to affect the 
students ... I feel Adam Fores t 
did a damn good job last year, 
with no incide nt., and he 
want s to do it and Davedoesn '( 
.. , I Itke Dave, r just don't like 
some of hIS ideas "." 

Along wit h hiS motion to 
crea le a "specia l TG fund, " 
Geiger tried to encourage the 
Coun cil to reco ns ider hiS

Earlier, while the Council

Geiger made a motion to fund

When present mg t he budget

Calling the PFS "a \ a\Jd film

Mopeds at UCSD 
prove dangerous 
continued (rom page 5 

mce most bike racks are 
only assessible by pede Irian 
paths, any mopeds parked 
there would obviously be in 
violat ion and could be ticketed . 
Thi . would be the most 

I 
common form of enforcement. 

Police cannot easily top a 
I?1oped on a pedestrian path 
!Ike. a car on a roadway, for 
ob\'IOUS reasons. " They just 
turn theIr heads and pretend 
they don't see you," said 
Brannon. 

But s ince mopeds cannot 
park In motorcycle places 

without a permit, some areas 
will be designated for moped 
parking. . 

The moped problem is still 
unresolved at thi s time. 
Howev r. the parking office 
has met with the police 
depart ment to plan posit ive 
steps to alleviate the problem . 

Brannon hopes everyone 
will cooperate. "The police are 
not out to get anyone. We have 
absolutely no quotas and we 
never will, " said Brannon. 
"It's just a matter of providing 
. afety. It's our job."

The festive atmosphere we're 
talking about in that light is 
catching a buzz. If we can't 
have parties without giving 
out free buzzes. this campus is 
suffering from a rea l ill ness. 
Besides. what kind of festive 
atmosphere do we hve if 
eigthteen and mneteen year 
olds are being dragged off to 
jai l?" 

''I'm mtere ted in the true 
spirit of TG 's, which is people. 
music. and a lively SOCIal 
atmosphere," added Parker. 

Does Parker feel that he has 
a responsibi lity to protect the 

. social health of the UCSD 
campus or to correct an alcohol 
problem? "No", he says. '" 
don't really care what 
students do (in their free time), 
but if there is a problem, the 
A should/!'I pay for it. I'm for 
a neutra l role. Some peop le 
thin k that a neu tral role 
means just buyi ng beer and 
letti ng it go. I think that we 
can have bot h: TG's with beer 
and t hose without." 

Parker further states, ''I'm 
looking to plan events for those 
under 21. Without beer at 
some TG 's we would have 
other refres menl s. more 
frequent events, and larger 
events. " 

Parker may even see his 
entire TG plan pu lied oU I from 
u ndcr him before t he quest ion 
whether to "uspend the rules 
c()me~ up for anot her \ ote. A

would be spent excl usivelv on

Whether or not beer would Ix' 
senecl at these TC 's is a 
separate quest ion as ycl 
unanswered. . 

Rcgardless of what the final 
decis ion is , Parker and his 
crit ics agr that there is a 
need for increased security 
and bettcr )[) checks at T(;'s.

your "other half' (i.e. of your 
personality) decided life is

havmg to worry about the 
washing machine eating your 
only pair of really comfortable 
pants, your hairdryer 
malfunctioning before a very 
important date, what the Caf 
IS really serving you for dinner, 
and whether or not it lcas the 
very resonant sounds emitted

"I am not. Besldes ... he was

"You can't bos" us around," 
Ihev sav in untson. "You're

this win and t heir wins for the 
rest of the season with his 
unIque prediction system, 

(3) Bill Walton \\ as not 
injured during the game (Bill 
Walton did not play in the 
game, either). 

(4) An unknown suspect 
tampered with the butter

using a popular laxative" hich 
made San Diego fans actually 

stand up Ix'fore the game \\a:-

Donald Sterling called the
