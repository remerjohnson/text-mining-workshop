Although the Berkeley city commission has 
recommended that the UC Berkeley Police 
Department di continue its use of pepper pray, 
UCSD police defend the afety and neces ity 
of the spray. 

Pepper spray, which contains the chemical 
agent oleoresi n capsicum (OC) and a mostly 
inert propellant, causes a burning sensation on 
the skin, burn ing and swell ing of the eyes and 
welling of the mucous membrane , temporari -

ly restricting breathing. 
C is a natu ra lly occurring substance found 

in the oily resin of cayenne peppers. 
UC D police carry pepper spray and report 

that they have used it approximately 10 time 
since it replaced mace in the early 1990s. 

D police officer Jeffrey ox said he feels 
that pepper spray i a reasonably safe and 
effective weapon. 
. " It is very rare that someone dies from pep-
per !> pray, and when death docs occur, Ihe per-
son has some underlying condition which was 
aggravated by the spray," he said. "We consid-

UCSD Medicine Recrulta People 
With Social Phobia for Study 

UCSD researchers have found in a two·year 
study that the medication paroxetine is extremely 
effective in the treatment of social phobia, a can· 
dition in which people are severely shy. Often stu· 
dents suffering from social phobia drop out of 
school. 

Research has shown that five percent of the popu· 
lation suffers from the disorder, but that most people 

do not seek treatment. 
The UCSD study is the first large·scale, placebo-

controlled study to show the effect of paroxetine in 
treating social phobia. UCSD is the lead site of 12 
sites throughout the nation that have recruited a total 
of 200 participants . 

UCSD is now recruiting 20 people to participate in 
the study 's second phase. Eligible participants must 
be 18 years and older and suffer from severe shy-
ness. For more information, call 622·6116.

the effec tiveness of pepper spray 
noted that noth ing more than fresh

recover from the spray's effects. 

"It takcs about 20 minutes for 
the spray to wear off and the person 
to get back to normal," Cox said. 

Cox added that there arc certain 
guidelines that must be followed 
when using pepper spray. 

"For the most effective result s, 
the spray should be three to 10 feet 
away from the face - otherwise 
the effects are weaker and the spray 
may come back on' you," he said.

PINION 
COMMENTARY: Some people (heterosexual and homosexual) were critical of the good press that Ellen's 

coming-out received, but the national attention really helped promote understanding and acceptance of gays 

TH'ROUGH ALL THE MEDIA HYPE~ THE PUBLIC 
LEARNED A LOT DURING ELLEN~S COMING-OUT 

By K.rln Sw.nn 
Contributing Oplnlor. Writer 

Anyone following the public 
discussion surrounding the com-
ing-out episode of "Ellen" heard 
the warnings from the Christian 
Right about the danger of cele-
brating this eve nt as a victory for 
gays and lesbians. I was surpri sed, 
however, to find well -meaning 
heterosexual friends on campus 
confi dently deriding the show's 
publicity as celebrity adulation. 

"Rea lly. I could n't care less 
that Ellen is comi ng out," a friend 
said. "I had a friend in college 
who struggled through comi ng-
out. and he never got all thi s 
attention." 

It 's ironic. I suppose, that 
while these reactions were intend-
ed a~ displays of loyalty to gay 
friends (myse lf included). they 
hurl. From their perspective, 
Ellen got a national pat -on- the-
back - a comfort they had felt 
powerless to provide when their 
gay friend" alone and afraid, had 

~poken to them with trepidation 
abou t their sexualit y. But now. 
this gay friend - me - was left 
to defend the significance of the 
show. 

My friends also cynica ll y point 

out that Ellen's coming-out has 
served 10 bolster the reputations 
of how's sponsors, which have 
less-than-clean records when it 
comes to gay issues. 

I think the cultural clout of 
primetime television shou ld call 
upon us, if only briefly, to si lence 
our crillca l tongues and listen 10 
those who believe they have 
something to gain from this event. 
The date of April 30, 1997, will be 
etched in my mind for many years 
to come. 

The "Ellen" party at The Top 
of The Park, a hotel in Banker 's 
Hill in San Diego, drew over 400 
women and men. There were four 
televisions lined up in one large 
room. A local news stati on wa, 
tapi ng in another room that held a 
wide-screen television. 

Each of the 400 people in 
attendance would have to decide 
in which room to stand. That sim-
ple decision. of course, says a lot 
about the si lence many people 
would have to take h me with 
them at the end of the evening -
even after Ellen had spoken out 
on primetime. 

I'll never fo rget the face of 
Kyung Lah , the reporter from 

hannel 10, who ca me to The Top 

of the Park to report on our party. 
Curious about Kyung 's percep-

tions as she sat waiting for the 
show to begin, I approached her to 
a k what she thought. We had a 
brief but touching conversation 
which. contrary to both of our 
expectations, had everything to do 
with what I, a lesbia n, share wilh 
her, a straight, Asian news 
reponer. 

After exchangi ng renections 
on the gathering. I told her that I 
had a couple of . traight, female, 
Asian friends who struggled with 
the dilemma of being both 
American and Asian. She had a 
white fiancee, she told me, and 
her family couldn't understand it. 

"You sec." I said. " we both live 
in two worlds." 

Later on, during a commercial 
break. I wa~ caught off guard 
when Kyung approached me with 
microphone In hand. 

"There's quite a gathering here 
tonight." she said. "What are your 
rcnection on the evening')" 

I looked beyond the camera-
man to tbe noisy crowd. Raising 
my voice, I said. "Well, it '> a great 
display of community; it's won -
derfu I to sec us all gathered

COMMENTARY: Although the Con titution protects the right to bear arms, there is no denying that guns are 
very dangerous and seldom useful , and that their widespread distribution is very harmful to our society 

CONQUERING THE AMERICAN GUN CULTURE 
By Simone S.ntlnl 
Contributing Opinion Wfl/er 

Talking about gun con trol 
these days is gelling dangerous. 
One is bound to make a lot of 
people unhappy if one advocates 
any substantial form of govern-
ment control. Because many sf 
these people own gu n~ , this 
might result in a pretty unpleas-
ant si tuation. 1 hope I will not 
incur the wrath of the aficionados 
of the Beretta, or fan s of mith & 

Wesson , if I dare 10 say some-
thing about the issue. 

Let's consider three ques-
tions: Is it socially desirable to 
enact some limits on the prolifer-
ation of guns" Is government 
control ethica l? Would stricter 
gun control be effective" 

There is no doubt that the pro-
liferation of guns in America 
cau es many problems. First, it 
causes accidents . tatistics show 
that the mo t likely victim of a 

Joe AnglulOj Guardlan 

gun are its owner and the mem-
bers of hi s or her family. 

Even when a gun is pulled out 
in defense, the consequences 
often go beyond the original 
i'ntentions. Consider, for 
instance, a shop owner who i 
being robbed and yields to the 
temptation of u ing a gun. The 
robber, who reacts by automalic 
reflex, wi II usuall y fire more 
quickly. transforming a robbery 
into a murder. 

Scared and nervous robbers 
arc much more dangerous than 
confident ones. The last thing 
one wanls is a nervous guy witb a 
gun. Even worse is a big, stupid. 
law-abiding ci ti zen with a gun 
who, in a delicate and tense si tu-
ation, suddenly decides to be a 
hero. u ually gelli ng six people 
killed and survi vi ng to be inter-
viewed live on the evening news . 

A significant number of mur-
ders in th e United States . are 
committed during burglaries , 
hold-ups and petty crimes. Some 
of the e crimes are probably a 
byproduct of the American fa ci -
nati on with firearm~ that 
inevitably extend to crimi nals. 
Even when firearm are u~ed 
defensively, one can' t get around 
the possibility that a criminal' 

fear wben confronting an armed 
victim make a violent reaction 
more likely. 

The question of whether gov-
ernment control is ethical raises a 
comple x con titutional problem . 
Let me as ume, for the moment , 
that the Second Amendment's 
guarant ee of the right to bear 
arms did not exist. It is normal 
and commonly accepted that cer-
tain activities must be Ii mited 
andlor regulated when they can 
cause danger to other people. For 
instance. one cannot drive a bu 
without the appropriate license. 

In general, one is not a llowed 
to do things that are dangerous 
(like blowing up a building) 
except in special circumstances 
(the building has 10 be demol-
ished) and with special precau-
tions and controls. 

Guns are extremely dangerou 
and serve few socia ll y construc-
ti ve purposes. There is nothing 
wrong in allowing the po sess ion 
of firearms under ' pecial circum-
stance . For instance, if one is a 
security guard or oft en carries 
valuables, carrying a gun would 
be appropriate. Only people who 
have received pecial training 
hould be tru "ted with guns . 

Unfortu nately , the issue is 

complicaled by America's consti -
tutional roots . The Second 
Amendment is part of the U.S. 
Constitution - a document that 
places the possession of gu ns on 
the same level as freedom or 
peech , press and as oelation . 

The right to bear arm. cannot 
be compared with tbe freedom s 
artic ulated in the First 
Amendment. Freedom of speecb 
is a fundamental concept of 
We tern civi li zati on. It i one of 
the few things that defines us as a 
culture . It is an important con -
cept not only as a defense against 
the institution of an authoritarian 
govern ment , but as a mea ns of 
social growth. 

The right to carry guns, by 
contrast, was derived from spe-
cific hi slorical and ocial circum-
stances, of the new ly independent 
A merica n colonies. No other 
country has such liberal laws for 
possess ion of weapons because 
no other country was formed in 
the same historical environment. 

A revol ution had just been 
won, and rapid expansion wa.

COMMENTARY: Alternative media should foster a diversity of 
idea, not engage in vicious harassment and low-brow humor 

WHY THE KOALA SUCKS 
By Michael Martin 
Staff Wflter 

Far be it from me 10 criticize a 
fellow journalist 's work. The 
time and energy that go into well-
wrillcn articles is nothing to 
,neClC at. For thi~ reason , even 
the most poorly wrillen article 
e~cape my cri ticism. There is no 
way to know what extenuating 
circulmtilnces co ntributed to a 

parti~ular article's lack of slyle. 
In the ca~e of the Koala . how-

eve r. somethIng has to be done. 
Si ncc pickinl! up my first copy 
ca rlier this yea r. I have never 
failed to be amaled by the pure 
fi Ith that this poor excuse for 
"alternative media" puhlishes. 

ntil I saw the Koala , I thought 
that most students had outgrown 
their need for humor that focuses 
on hodily function~ . Can anyone 
seriously consider the Koala 
journa lism? Docs anyone even 
find it funny? 

Even if one could scrap the 
Koala 's worthless articles, the 
ugliest part would remain. At the 
end of every issue, the personals 
that students submit at the Koala 
office arc printed in a classified-
section format. In perfect scato-
logical form, studenls (always 
anonymous) verbally cruci fy 
their classmates. Every form of 
sexual hara 'sment can be found 
in this section. 

Unfortunately, it is hard to 
find someone who will admit that 
this section is sick and twisted. 
Has everyo ne forgotten how it 
feels to be the brunt of such an 
attack') 

In ~pite of the fact that I feel 
the Koala b not a healthy part of 
the UCSD community. I would 
not have written tbis article 
unl e~s my money was being used 
to print it. Many student~ assume 
that the Koala supports itself 
through advertising. That heing 
the case. few of us have the stom-
ach to lift a finger in protest. We · 
live in a free coun try: If we don't 
like it , we don ' t have to read it. 

The sad truth is that several 
thousand dollars of tudent fees 

Until I saw the 
Koala, I thought 
that most students 
had outgrown their 
need for humor 
that focuses on 
bodily functions. 
Can anyone 
seriously consider 
the Koala 
journalism? Does 
anyone even find it 
funny? 

- fees that come from every 
UCSD student 's pocket - kept 
Ihe Koala printing this year. 
Under the guise of "a ltern ati ve 
media." anyone may ' ubmit a 
proposal for fundi ng to the A.S. 
Few such proposals are denied. 
The Koala appears to be a case 
where A.S. approved funding 
without as king any questions. 

I do not blame A.S. for 
approvi ng such a proposal. They 
faced First Amendment issues 
when co nsidering whe th er to 
support such a newspaper. 
Instead , I hlame ·tudents for not 
telling A.S. what should be done 
with thei r money (in this case. 
what should not be done with it) . 

I appea l, then, to any UCSD 
students with a conscience. To 
people like the Chri tian fellow-
ships, Asian American Christian 
Fellowship. Korean Christian 
Fellowship, Interva rsity and the 

'avigators: Do you care that 
)llUr mone is heing used to 
propagate thi s rubbish? Tell your 
A. representatives what you 
think . If enough peopl speak up. 
~omeone will have the courage to 
pull the plug. 

UCS D's biggest resource is 
the diversity of its student hody. 
"Alternative media" should 
emhrace this diversi ty, bringing 
to light hol es in mainstream per-
specti ves. Although many stu-
dents would point 10 it as repre-
se ntative or alternative media. 
the Koala does not really deal 
with issue. It certainl docs not 
emhrace diversit y. 

Although some of my col-
leagues would disagree. I find 
that many of the other puhlica -
tions that receive funding from 
A.S. as "alternati ve media" are 
very legitimate. Puhlications like 
V(r Frollteri-a and the Last 
Ilidicator. nOl to mention small -
cr-scale effo rts like Walkill/i 
Stick, are all positive contribu-
tions to our social environ ment. 
Too many students ha ve their 
heads in the sand when it comes 
to cu rrent events. The more pub-
lications we can make ava ilable. 
the better. 

In the case of the Koala. how-
ever, I ca ll for remittance out of 
anger. With an exaggerated sense 
of pride. it demeans every aspect 
of life that anyone has ever found 
holy. How can a university that 
ha policies agai nst sex ual 
harassment support a newspaper 
that harasses '! How many stu -
dent s want their money to pay for 
such a cri me? 

One thing I' ve always loved 
about UC Berkeley is the vas t 
number of 'l ines iUld se lf-pub-
lished pamphlets that acc umulate 
in the entrances to area book-
stores and record shops . With 
Berkeley's tradition of exploring 
and debating .soc io-po litical 
philosophies. its stu dent s arc 
hungry 10 have th ei r ideas 
exposed to the world and held up 
for criticism.

PRIMATES: 
Female chimps 
sleep around 
Continued from page 2 

The results were astonishing . Of 
the 13 offspring in the community, 
only six were sired by males from 
within the community. Gagneux 
concluded thaI Ihe remaining seven 
must have been sired by males 
from out ide the community. 

''It's not an accident," Gagneux 
said. "The females' sneaking off is 
likely causing it , and iI 's happening 
all the time." 

Gagneux said the study demon-
strates that far from being passi ve 
objects of male desire and Strate-
gies, Ihe female primates arc smart, 
a-<.:tive and even duplicitous in 
seeking oul reproductive opportu-
nilies. 

Gagneux likened Ihe females ' 
\)chavior 10 the prinl:iple of "not 
pUlling all your eggs in one bas-
ket ," 

"What you have here is two 
worlds, one for the male and the 
01 her for the female," he said. " It 's 
in the male ' intere t to hold a big 

. territory. For the female, it's in her 
genelil: interesls to choose from the 
widest possib le array of fathers, 
which is an importan l pan of evo-
lution, as well as keeping access to 
Ihe good resources of the male 
group she. has joined. II ' like a 
backup syslem. In a few words, 
what the female arc doing is shop-
ping from a wider gene poof." 

Female chimpan7.ees are appar-
entl y successful with their duplici -
ty. An adult male cannol tell by 
appearance or smell whether a par-
ticular infant is hi s. 

FOIBLES: 
Most UCLA charges 
were dropped 
Continued from page 8 
of Students First!. to.ld the Daily 
Bruin that the purpose of the ad was 
"to moti vate people about USAC 
(Undergraduate Student Association 
Council), the din'erent victories stu-
dent govemmenl has had thi s year 
and to try to get people more 
involved in student government." 

However, the Daily Bruin 
reported that some students were 
concerned the ad was an open 
endorsement of Students First! 
presidential candidate Kandea 
Mosley. because she is named in 
the ad as the person to contact if 
sludcnts have any questions aboul 
USAC. 

The Students First! slale ulti-
malely secured a majority of posi-
. . 

tlons, . and Mosley was ele(;ted 
USAC president. 

According 10 Ihe Dail\' Bruin, 
"approximalely 35 comp lainl s 
were fil ed against candidale~ from 
Students Fil ~ l ! and A (; (;c~ s 
Coa lilion , hUI mO~1 were cilher di ~­
regarded or given a INarnlng by Ihe 
Election Board." 

According to the Daily Bruin, 
the IwO complai nt s concerning the 
ad were dl~(;arded hy (he Elcctio!l 
Board - a ruling Ihat di sappointed 
members of Ihe newly formed 
organilation .. lUdents for Ethil:al

Students for Ethical

Yakov Zolotorev 
Associate Photo Editor 

Photographer's 
Gripes 

Everybody knows that photog-
raphers. as a rule. are the mo t illit-
erate people on a newspaper staff. 
So the fact that I am wri ting thi s is 
in itself a miracle. Never before has 
a photographer been allowed to 
publish hi s degenerate scribblings 
in the form of a co lumn. So there. I 
am making history here. If you are 
dumb enough to read this rag of 
ours at all. then maybe you : II find 
perverse pleasure in reading thi s 
particular "article." 

First off, let me explai n why [ 
be<.:ame a picture guy and nOl a reg-
ular pen-and-notepad-carrying 
journalist. 

lournali sm requires patience, 
perseverance and people skills. [ 
have the patience of a five-year-
old, perseverance is something that 
I looked up in the dictionary and 
my people skills are on par with 
those of a hungry fly -infested lion 
in Africa. 

Consider the above as a dis-
clai mer for the contents of this. er. 
whatever Ihis i . 

I've got to admit. ] am a cur-
mudgeon. 11 is in my nalure to 
accumulate complaints. Over the 
lasl five highly forgeltable years. 
UCSD has done a thorough job of 
pissing me off. 

There are so many things in this 
instilution of questionable learning 
that irritate me that I just do not 
know wherc to begin. So here they 
are, in no particular order. 

UCSD parties. A party. here?! 
Well . yes. I was such a miserable 
sod when I was a freshman that I 
actually attended a few of these 
non-events. All of them had one 
thing in common - the incessant-
ly rude UCSD rent-a-cops who 
always, always showed up just 
when the festivilie were getting 
started. 

The anti-alcohol policy of this 
university is not ridiculous jusl in 
that it is unenforceable. While our 
valiant security personnel spend 
their Friday and Saturday nights 
confiscating alcohol from acne-
addled freshmen. thieves have a 
free run of Ihe parking lOIS. 

Halflhe peoplc I know have had 
their cars busted up or stolcn . Of 
course, Ihe univcrsity feel obligat-
cd to charge you 300 bucks for the 
dubious privi lege of parking on 
campus. just so some scumbag can 
rip out your stereo and buy himse lf 
some crack. 

Another party-re lated peevc -
people hcre can't hold their liquor. 
That 's right - Americans can't 
drink for shit. It always amazcs me 
just how many college students 
drink themselves IOto a stupor with 
regularity on Friday night. even on 
a campus a restrictive as thi s onc. 

Once they do so. one of three 
things happens. In the best case 
scenario, they puke Iheir guts out in 
the bathroom and quietly pas out 
in the corner. The not-so- Iucky 
one pa s out and then puke, a la 

. Jimmy Hendrix. 
Last but not least. t here is

It's worldlamous for its 
neon lights and all-you-can-

to excess, and lots of it, one 
place comes to mind ... 

Your mom probably warned you sternly about it 
when you were a lad. She probably explained that it was 
a place where you would lose all of your money in 
shadily run casinos amidst rampant drinking and ~Iimy 
carousing with abhorrently atl i red showgirls. 

But you're in college now. Having been forever 
doomed to attend ooring family vacations at cliched 
spots like the Grand Canyon or Disneyland. you're 
ready to break out and welcome a little si n into your life. 
Where are you gonna go?

Where e lse can you appease your stomach with a ver-

Depression Plagues Students 
By Prlya Honeyman 
Guardian Reporrer 

Too ad to social ize, too unmo-
tivated 10 study and feeling wonh-
less and emply, one student 
embraces sleep a an escape from 
the daily depression thaI has come 
over her - and a welcome relief 
from the fatigue that has character-
ized her everyday life since an 
unexpected family Iragedy intruded 
upon her home. 

This is not an uncommon scene 
today. Many people experience 
similar bouts of depression , and an 
increa ing numher of college stu-
dents arc among the 15 million 
Americans who sufTer from depres-

~ion each year. 
Director of UCSO 's 

Psychologll:al and Counse ling 
Services Dr. John Giebink esti-

mate~ that bel ween 40 and 50 per-
cent of studenlS seeking their help 
arc dealing with some form of 
deprcs~ion . 

" It 's hard to say because people 
come in for a variel y of reasons," 
Giebi nk said. " A person might 
l:ome in because of academic prob-
lems, unahle to concenlrate or 
study, but then if you talk 10 them it 
might turn out Ihat they're 
depressed also." 

Clinical depression is different 
from Ihe occasional "blues" that 
every person experiences at differ-
ent limes in hi s life. Clinical 
depression consiSIS of feelings of 
sadness that are out of proportion 
to e~temal l:auses, and normal day-
to-day panems are disrupted by 
changes in mood and one's per-
spective on the world and one's 
self. 

General symptoms exhibited in 
depressed people arc: depressed 
mood, reduced interest in almost all 
activities, significant weight gain 
or weight loss, insomnia or too 
much sleep, too much or too linlc 
motor activity, faligue or energy 
loss, feelings of worthlessne s or 
guill, reduced abililY 10 concentrate 
and recurrenl thoughts of death or 
suicide. 

The Ihree most com lllon forms 
of depression arc major depression, 
dysthymia and bipolar di sorder. 

Major depression is a mood dis-
oroe! Ihal is accompanied by 
severe feelings of sadnesl>, empti -
ness and olher relaled sy mptoms 
that disrupt normal living patterns. 
If a person has five or more of the 
nine gCtleral symptoms of depres-
sion listed above, thaI person is suf-
fering from major depression.

Clinical depr .... on 
Is dlff.r.nt from the 
occasional "blues" 
that every person 
experiences at dif-
ferent times in his

of depression, and it involves 
chronic symploms that do not dis-
able a person, but keeps him from 
functioning at his peak level. 
Bipolar depression is also called 
manic-depressive illness. It is not 
as common as olher forms of 
depressive di sorder , and is charac-
terized by cycles of mania and 
depression. 

One Revelle freshmen, Meghan 
0 ' Neal, recall s a bout of deep 
depres ion she experienced that 
evenfually lead to some deep, but 
positive, changes within herself. 

" I really Ihink it wa. kind of 
something that 1 needed," O' Neal 
aid . "It " kind of weird, like I 

can't really remember how I was 
before. I don ' l know how it 
changed me so much, but it did . 
It 's funny. It 's good - just because 
I learned things about my elf, like 
I reali zed Ihat some of my insecu-
rities were not really viahle. There 
was not really a reason for them, 
and so I had higher self estcem 
after that." 

People try to self-medicale their 
depression in many ways, says 

Giebink . Studenls oflen usc drugs 
and alcohol as means 10 e cape 
from depression. However, 
Giebink says these self-diagnosed 
solulions only add to the problem. 
Ironically, alcohol is very popular 
on the self- medicating market, 
and, alcohol being a depressant , 
only serves 10 bring users further 
down. 

"Probably one of Ihe main ways 
in dealing [wilh depression] is for 
people 10 u e tltt:i r friends, and a iot 
of limes a person can get through 
trying circumstance wilh friends 
and family," Giebink aid. "So I 
would say Ihal's Ihe main Ihing." 

O' Neal agreed. 
"I think probahly my bcst friend 

[got me through ill ." she said." he 
wa~ the only one at that time I whol 
really kn~w what I was go ing 
Ih rough. I also slarted working oul 
a 101 and goi ng out with my friend~ 
a lot." 

The causes for depres!>ion in 
indi,·idual vary, but according 10 
Glcbink Ihere "secm 10 be Iwo gen-
eral themes with regards 10 depres-
sion." 

"One is that depression is bio-
logically based and the other is thaI 
it 's psychologically based," he 
said . "For most people, it's a mix-
ture of biological and socio-psy-
chological factors . So if we ' re 
going to lake a look at students 
coming in, then you'd say thaI 
some of them are this way because 
of generil:s, or because something 
has happened biochemically. Bul 
for mosl people thaI' nOI likely 10 
trigger depression. What triggers 
depression are even Is. Usually iI'S 
the kind of thing where the person 
fee ls some sense of loss." 

In common cases Ihis loss can 
include the death of a relative, the 
break up of an intimate re lationship 
or friendship, loss of money or 
preslige, poor work in chool or al 
work, drug u e or family problems. 

While there are a variety of rea-
sons that depression manifests itself 
in individuals - such as poor self-
esteem, strong dependency needs or 
poor interpersonal skill - these 
mani festalions arc nothing more 
than triggers for the true cause of 
depression which, as Giebink said, 
is an alteration in the depressed 
individual's brain chemistry. 

This alteration is similar to an 
ordinary change that one undergocs 
when experiencing grief and fru s-
tration . However, unlike the norm, 
this type of alteration sustain ilself

events that triggered the alteration

There is some good news about 
depression, however; 'rue depres-
sion is treatable. Eighty percent of 
depressed people improve with 
psychological aid, and there are a 
number of treatments that can be 
prescribed to patients. 

A'nti -depressant prescriptions 
are often given, along with pre-
scriptions for psychotherapies. The 
mo t common of the latter are cog-
nitive-behav ioral therapies and 
interpersonal treatments. 

Cogniti ve-behavioral therapy 
stresses di srupting depressed 
thought patterns to gel the individ-
ual thinking in a more beneficial 
way, and it focuses on improving 
selr esteem thro.ugh erercise, prop-
er nutrition and recreation. 
Interpersonal therapy deals with 
strengthening and creating new 
relationships ~ , that the depressed 
individual can receive support 
when he or she needs it. 

Although O' Neal never sought 
professional counseling, she says 
she did talk with her mother and 
friends a lot. 

"One of my favo rite th ings is 
goi ng out to coffee shops, so wc'd 
do that a lot my junior year, just 
si tting ' and talking," she said. '" 
guess talking was kind of my best 
therapy because I found out that 
there were peop le [who] really 
cared about me." 

One of the biggest misunder-
standings (;om;erning anti ·depres-
san ts is that they are simply "happy 
pi lis." Unlike the common street 
drug which improves the mood of 
almo t everyone who takes it, anti -
depressants only Ii ft the spirits of 
those who are depressed. 

Individual often fccl very isol,,,-

Xavier that he had bi-polar tenden-

Interviews by Grace Jang 
Photography by Ethan Schreiber 

My roommates arc both 
really messy. One of my 
roommates has a rea lly 
delayed reaction on cleaning 
up and the other one has a 
rea lly smelly turtle. He never 
cleans the tank and it gets 
really smelly. 

Ellen Stuart

moody. We have given her 
eight different names for her 
eight different personalities. 

Julie Duggan

My roommate gelS on 
obsessive cleaning sweeps 
where she will clean non-

midterms when she 'hould be

Wisconsin Has An AU-American Atmosphere 
NATIONALS: Led by senior pole vaulter Creed Stary's second-place finish, four Tritons brought home All-American honors 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

A television ad campaign re-
cently pined California agai nst Wis-
consin in a bailie for cheese su-
premacy. This past 
week, though, the 
co mpetition was 
athl etic, not culi -
nary . Wi consin has 
di stingui shed itself 
as t he I and of cheese 
and the Green Bay 
Packers, and, while 
these hardly qualify 
a state as a haven for 
track and field en-
thusia ts, the Uni -
versity of Wiscon-
sin-La Crosse was at center stage 
when it hosted the NCAA Division 
III National Championships. 

UCSD sent a contingent of eight 
athletes to Wisconsin to compete not 
just for pride's sake, but for the repu-
tation of the entire state. The Tritons 
certainly held their own as four ath -
letes earned All -American status. 

impressive vaults , Stary hit a 
mid eason slump and struggled 
through some meets, but found his 
stride au he perfecltime. At theCCAA 
conference champion hipstwoweeks 

earlier, Stary won the 
polevaultona ingle 
jump and rode that 
momentum into Na-
tionals. The second-
place finish was the 
highest ever by a 
UCSD pole vaulter. 

Joining Stary in 
earning Ali -Ameri -
can honors was se-
ni or middle -di s-
tance standout 
Rhodes Walton. Af-

ter an up-and-down career at UCSD, 
Walton received vindication when 
he placed si)(th in the 1500·meters. 

A fifth -year senior, Wahon was 
ruled ineligible just before the cross 
country national championships due . 
to a mix-up involving hi s redshirt 
statusduring hi freshman year. With 
the memory of the missed opponu-
nity as a driving force, Walton ex-
ploded on to the track scene this 
year and became one of the domi-
nant runners in the state. 

"It was a feeling of completeness 
being up on the stand," Walton aid. 
UI completed Jny quest that began 
five-years ago. It was an honor." 

With an eighth-place finish in the 
men's hammer throw. senior Geoff 
Lambert grabbed All -American hon-
ors and brought to a close one of the 
most impressive throwing careers at 
UCSD. A previous ational quali · 
fier, Lambe" threw the hammer 175· 
9 and missed lipping into seventh 
place by only one inch. 

"Geofr throwing was impres-
sive," Triton Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale said. UTo be able to throw 
your be t at the Nationals is quite an 
accomplishment. He set the stage 
for our other competitors ." 

Whi Ie seniors dominated on the 
men's side, sophomore Maggie 
Dwire was the standout for the 
women of UCSD. Running the 800 
meters, Dwire managed to disre· 
gard the effects of racing a qualify-
ing heat the day before and placed 
seventh. A nationals qualifier in 
cross country, Dwire earned AII-
American status and lowered her 
own school record by clocking a 
time of 2: 14.01. 

Mark Patterson/G_dian 

Leading the way for the Tritons 
was senior pole vaulter Creed Stary, 
who vaulted 16-4 3/4 to place sec-
ond in the co mpetition. Stary 
matched the winning height from 
last year's meet. but Wisconsin-La 
Crosse's Mike Schnur used his 
home-field advantage to vault 17-2 
1/4 to break the Division III national 
record as well as to set a new sta-
dium mark. 

After qualifying for Nationals in 
three events, Walton chose to focus 
on the 1500. Hi s decision paid off. 
Despite a driving rain that began on 
the third lap. Walton moved up with 
the lead pack and held on to sixth 
place, which earned him a spot on 
the victory stand. 

In one of the mo ,t heartbreaking 
stories of the year, senior Lisa 
Shepard, who had placed second 
and third at the past two national 
championships in the 100-meter 
hurdles, suffered a poor stan in the 
preliminaries and failed to qualify 
for the final s. 

Over: ?enior AII·American Creed Stary placed second at Nationals. 

Afteropeningthescason with some The Tritons clo ed out the track 
season on quite a successful note 
with four All -Americans and a 

wealth of experience to continue a 
UCSD track dynasty.

THE COACH 
TRAVIS HILL 

Geriatric Park: 
Life in the NBA 

To hell with Kobe Bryant, 
Kevin Gamett and Allen 
I verson. The gods of the 

ational Basketball Association 
will never die. While the diaper 
dandies are playing with their 
diamond- tudded chew toys in 
their milli n-dollar cribs while 
the guy they were supposed to 
replace in the spotlight are still 
getting the job done. 

The superstars of the 1980s 
- Jordan, Barkley, Olajuwon, 
Malone and the gang are still 
winning here in the late '90s. 
Maybe this group of future hall 
of famers is just gelling better 
with age. Or maybe the new 
crop of young players and young 
organizations just don 't 
understand what it takes to make 
it in thi league. 

Realistically, it is both. True, 
the living legend are creaking 
up and down the court. Some of 
these guys just won't give up. I 
fear for the safety of player like 
Robert Pari h. 

The Chief was once a great 
center, but that was in the 19605. 
I get scared when he starts 
banging against guys like 
Shaqui lle O'Neal - haq could 
very easily kill the poor senior 

... - citizen and not even know it. 
On the other hand, the reason 

why players like 57-year-o ld 
die Johnson are ~till allowed 

to make 40-footers to win huge 
playorr game~ is becau\e the~e 
younger players are bad. 

These idiot~ who are 
\klpPlng college to come to the 

BA di~gu~t me. The~e players 
are greedy and they want the 

l1lillion~ now; they arc young 
and do not ~now heller. 
SOllleone needs to put their foot 
down and under~tand that the~e 

player~ arc not vel y good lor the 
NBA 

We have heen \L'Cln ' the sad 
results (l Ithe BA \ current 
policy throughout the 
p()st~eas()n . I the fillallour 
teams, three 01 the lour average 
over 30 years of agc per player. 
We have been watching some of 
the ugliest haskethall in recent 
history. The scores arc ex-
tremely low, hut it is not due to 
great defense. It is becau~c or 
terrible shooting and th' same 
Illonotonous two-man games 
that every team utiiJ/es. 

You still gOlla love the~e old 
guys showing up the younger 
generation, though. It is so runny 
to watch how crafty they are -
and how much they really are 
succeeding. 0 long live the 
geriatric all-Mars, they reall 
11lIght play rorever. As long as 
they don't break a hip.

UCSD's proposed 
move from Division 

III sports to Division II 
has Triton coaches all 

o ahead. Ask any'UCSD 
Head Coach on campus 
about the proposed 
!J)ove from Divi ion III 

to Division II. Ask him if the move would 
hurt hi s program. A~k how they can be 
successrul withoul scholarships and why 
the move has taken so long to be consid-
ered . . 

We did. But whatever an!.wcrs you re-
cei ve, get ready to he immersed ina thought-
provokl ng conver~at ion. E ver ~ I nce 0 
,tudent!. overwhelmingly VOiced their de-
sire to move from Di vision III athletics to 
DiVISion [J In the April general eleclion. 
the que~tion of a move has been the hot 

topiC 01 conversation around the water

opinion on the matter. And what better per-
son than acurrentTnton head coach. Aftcrall , 

the} are the ones who rec ruit , coach. teach and 
stri ve for excellence In theIr respecti ve sporh. 

The mostlmpre~'lve statistic thatjump~ out 
after analYZing our poll , IS the overwhclmlllg 

support rorsuch a move. AII1 3 olthe coaches we 
contacted echo the need It> make the move. 

"It 's something that needs to happen," baseball 
Head oach Robert Fletcher sa id. "We don ' t helong 
In DiVision 111." 

"The move I . good becau. e we get to play 'like' 
schools," men ' tennis Head oach Brian Turner. 

As the campus enrollment grows to 20,000 stu-
dent , it is getting harder lind harder for the sports 
teams to findcompctiti n. Other Division IJ I schools 
are much smaller on average. CSD is not allowed 
to join a conference of Divi ion III chools, thus 
hampering coaches' attempts to 'chedule games late 
into their sea on . Other Divisi n III school are In 

Divided Outlooks 
Because of the proposed move from Division III sports to Division II will affect 
the athletes, the administration and the athletic department, we asked Triton Head 
Coaches what they thought of the possible move and its ramifications . 

COACHES' POLL Yes No

conference, committed to play conrerence contests. 

Such a move to Divi. ion II would occur without 
the introduction of cholarships. C Davi i an 
example of a Di Vision II choolthat ha pro. pered in 
different ports without the aid of scholar hips. 
Coaches were asked whether their programs could 
succeed without the advent of scholarship~ . inc of 
the 13 coaches agreed that the move could be made 
without sacrificing team succe s. ports like men 's 
vo lleyba ll , crew, fencing, water polo, cro s country 
and track regularly wmpete against Division I and II 
programs. And they arc quite successful. 

" It\ too bad that we can't have the same type of 
scholar~hipped program that our competition has, 
hut I fthl~ IS the way we start to move up, then r mall 
fo r It ," Fletcher said. 

However, CSD would be at an immediate diS-
advantage III other .,ports. 

"Schoob that are desperate to get players wi ll 
give a fu ll scholarship to a player they have never 

~een. so Ihat the scholarship money will not go to 
wa\te." women' ssoccer Head Coach Brian McManus 
:-.ald. 

Furthermore, C D's high academic ~tandards 
proVide another obstacle for future competltl veness 
at the DiVision II level. Many coaches have a tough
