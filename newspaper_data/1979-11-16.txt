Regents to Raise Reg Fee Ceiling 
By Eric Jaye 

LOS ANGELES - An increase in 
the registration fee ceiling allowing a 
$117 yearly increase within three 
years will be approved today by the 
UC Regents, an overwhelming 
Finance Committee vote here 
yesterday indicated. 

With only student Regent Hecto 
Lozano dissenting , the committee 
voted to recommend the increase to the 
full board today. Observers expect the 
full board will a c cept the 
recommendation by a similar margin. 

Authority whould then fall on the reg 
fee committees on each of UC's nine 
campuses to raise reg fees within the 
prescribed ceiling. 

UCSD's registration fee will 
probably rise "close to the maximum 
allowed," Chanc 1I0r McElroy said 
here yesterday. 

AFSCME Files 
To Represent 
UC Workers 

By John Hondroa 
AlIOCiate Newa Editor 

The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees has 
filed the second in a series of petitions 
which it hopes will eventually allow it to 
be sole bargaining agent for UC non-
faculty employees. 

AFSCME filed the petition to 
represent 1,300 university skilled 
crafts workers, receiving support from 
"close to half" of the employeei in that 
bargaining unit, including operating 
engineers, carpenters and engineers. Reg Fees will be allowed to rise over 

the next three years from the current 
$393 systemwide yearly maximum to 
$510 by the 1982·83 academic year 
under the plan submitted by UC 
President David Saxon. 

UC President David Saxon (J.) and Regents' OWnnan Robert Reynolds 

It calls for a systemwide election to 
decide on a bargaining representative 
for that unit. 

Please tum to pate 16 

Reg fees at UCSD are $384 a year, 
nine dollars under the maximum. 

Both McElroy and Student Lobby 
Co-director Dave Shontz said they 
expected little opposition to the fee rise 
at the full Regents meeting this 
morning. 

Reg Fee budgets have been under 
severe strain since the 14.5 percent 
salary increase approved by the 
Legislature last spring, Saxon said. 

Witho~t an increase , drastic 
cutbacks in Reg.fee.funded programs 
will be necessary, Saxon told the 
committee. 

Shontz said the lobby understood 
that an increase was necessary , but 
wanted the increase limited to $36 for 
next year . with the option of additional 
increases if necessary. 

Saxon told the committee he wanted 
the three-year increase plan because, 

"once every three years is enough - it 
is not exactly an issue that brings us 
together. " . 

In other action yesterday, the 
Finance Committee recommended the 
Regents ask the legislature for a 10.5 
percent rise in faculty salaries. 

Even with last spring's salary 
increase, UC has not managed to 
stay comp,etitive with the "most 
prestigious ' universities, Saxon told 
the committee while recommending the 
budget. 

UC salaries for full professors are 
currently below those paid by Harvard, 
Stanford, Yale, MIT, Cal Tech and 
Michigan. 

A full UC professor currently makes 
naearly $35,000 a year, compared to 
$39,000 for his or her counterpart at 
Harvard. 

The proposal is expected to Win 
approval at the meeting today. 

Student Center Board Will 
Move 'Guardian' to Hut 

By Jenifer Warren 
Staff Writer 

The Daily Guardian wiU be moving 
from the Student Center next quarter to 
the Coffee Hut, although its staff is not 
sure the move is a good idea. 

"A protest would · have been futile 
. considering the political ~ne-up of the 

Student Center Board. The members 
of the board want us to move, and 
even Vic e Chancellor Richard 
Armitage supports the idea ," Editor 
Eric Jaye said. 

The mandated move , expected to be 
completed by the start of next quarter, 
comes as a result of a "space allocation 

request the newspaper made of the 
Student Center Board last year," said 
board member Jane T oggenburger. 

When the paper asked for more 
space, however, it did not expect to be 
transferred from the centrally located 
Student Center to the isolated Calfee

Like, What Could I Do About It, Anyway? 
By Trapper Byrne 

Special to the Guardian 
Even if you don't ~ve in Berkeley, you've probably 

heard of People's Park, where aD those hippies rioted 
back in the sixties over something or other. And the 
University of California, which owned and stiD owns 
the land, let all those hippies keep the par~. That 
would have been intere.ting to see. 

Well, things are a little different now. You know, 
like, Paul McCartney, he ~ys he was "never r~ly 
into drugs at all," and Bob Dylan - well, Bob 
Dylan used to rage against stupid people, and now he. 
r~s against heathens. You know how it is. 

Things are a ~ttIe different with the Park now, too. 
lbere's a free parking lot in People's Park, one of the 
few in Berkeley. Or rather there was a free parking 
lot, until a couple of weeks ago when UC lost one of 
its fee lots to construction and decided to convert the 
free lot. Starting today, only students and faculty with 
fee cards wiD be permitted in the lot. 

This action has a number of people upset, mainly 
those sixties-types, such as People's Park Council 
leader David Axlerod, who wallow in the 
conventional political proceu for the street people. 

1ne PPC signed an agreement with the Univenity 
in May, 1978, stipulating that if the University 
wanted to make any change in the park's status it 
would first consult the PPC. 

Axlerod says the University didn't inform the PPC 
about the fee lot conversion before they annOunced it. 
Vice-Chancellor Robert Kerley says Axlerod did 
know, and besides, the parking lot never has been a 
part of People's Park, so UC can do anything it wants 
with it. 

All ~ .... Ied to a considerable amount of talk of 
Ia effect that this is UC's first move to 

"retake" the Park, and that by 1986 700 stu<{ents 
will be living in eight story dorms where street people 
now sleep under trees. 

Street People. The street people would be the ones 
most affected by any change in the park's status, 
because the street people are the ones who use the 
park most. Several clusters of them can be seen 
during any non-rainy day, and some sleep in the park 
at night, at least those who can avoid the midnight 
UC police round-up. 

So to find out what the street people, the most 
shunned and stereotyped group in Berkeley, think 
about the parking lot conversion and its possible 
ramifications, I wandered into the park one day to 
talk with some of them. Some people, however, don't 
always appreciate being studied. 

Axlerod said at a recent student senate meeting 
here that "there 's a great deal of resentment by street 
people toward students - you know, they get to go 
to college and everything." What he meant by 
"everything," though he tactfully avoided spelling it 
out to the assembled students, was a place to sleep 
that has a roof, and a fairly steady source of income. 

This "resentment" was readily apparent to me as I 
walked up nonchalantly to my first prospective 
subject and said, in my best reporter's voice, "Hi. 
Can I talk to you for a second?" 

"No." 
The direct approach having failed , I tried 

something a tittle hipper, a ~ttle smoother. I strode 
over to two apparent street people and said coolly, 
"Howdy" What's going on?' 

"Ftx;k off, rich kid. Ha! Hal Ha!" 
Obviou Iy, this was going to require a different, 

unique strategy. So I went home, rolled four joints,

The Iranian hostage

This is not a letter condemning 
the Shah of Iran's social 
behavior (allegedly killing

doIIan). 1his is not a letler 
supporting Prelident Carter's 
economic actions against Iran, 
nor does it address Iran's 
economic actions against the

It i. bad enough that the

Students Lowest Priority 
Editor: 

UCSD profellOrs ' are ~nding 26.1 hours a week teaching 
(Dail" G.arcllan, Nov. 8). Imagine that, 5.2 hours an academic 
c!al_ on Iludents. ' 

Yet the "average number of hours spent weekly with studenta 
has declined to 11.8 from laat years (1977-78) 13" by 
profeuon. What about the 14.3 hours spent on teaching but not 
with .tudents? furthermore, why are only 11.8 out of 61 hours 
01 professor time rpent with students? 

The editorial "Give and Take" (Nov. 13) was about UC 
profeuon and the dedining number of houra they are spending 
with .tudents. 1lae article excused UCSD's lask of interest in 
students and acluaUy stated ~t "it i. possible that UCSD 
profelsora could actually be devoting more time to serving 
students" than ever before. 

The fact i. that profellors are spending len time with students 
and more time on research. According to a report by the Institute 
for Research in Sccial Behavior, UC professors apent an 
average of 61 total hours a week in university-related activities, 
in the 1978-79 academic year. This figure is down by more than 
one hour from the previous year. This drop points toward the 
decline in the number of hours spent either teaching or advising 
students. 1ne report showed that the time spent on research went 
up from 22.9 to 23.2 hour. and committee work increased from 
7.5 to 7.7 hours a week. "The only category that profs spent lelis 
time on was with students. 

The reason for this is simple. "The UC system does not pay its 
professors to teach students; it pays them to do reaearch. 
Students are simply getting screwed .

increaling registration fees will students be getting a better

tions against Iranians and ugly 
demonstrations against

I have seen pictures of 
Americans chasing, catching 
and seriously injuring another 
human being, an Iranian. How 
much "bravery" is there in 
three Americans beating up 
one Iranian? In this case, the 
Beverly Hills police arrested

Since when ill unlawful

There are other allinine

I doubt the perpetrators of 
these wi~s actually mean 
them Iiter~, just like Iranians 
don't really mean "Kill the

Nevertheless, these slogan. 
play upon the emotions,

\t is true the American

"The immediate · cause is to

Whatever action takes place 
pursuant to that is a matter for 
international politicians to

There is a lot of pressure 
that can be brought to bear on 
the Iranian goverrunent to

procedures. Pressure must be 
brought by those that know 
better how to ulle it 
responsibly. Persecution of 
Iranians in this country is 
counterproductive to the

woman in a halter-top blouse 
swung towards the counter 
where food stamps were 
disbwaed. 

She propped her hands on

News Service. 

shoulder as the derk took her 
green card, counted out $95 
worth of stamps and asked 
her to sign a receipt. · "Why 
not?" she said. grinning at a 
rigid, balding man leaning 
on a cane, "\t's easy." Then 
she tucked the coupons into 
her waistband and sashayed 
·away. 

An angry buzzing filled 
the lobby. Housewives ,-
businessmen, retirees and the -
postal clerks themselves 
joined in the denunciations. 
"They spend their money on 
drugs, then exPect us to feed 
them," a woman ranted. 

On a hunch, I intercepted 
the young woman as she 
climbed into a 12-year-old 
station wagon in , which a 
companion aOd two young 
children waited. She was 
candid. 

"I dress like that on 
purpose," she &aid laughing, 
"just to bug them." 

"Do you know how many 
times I've been turned down 
fOl' jobs? Do you know how 
much I could earn if I got one? 
About half what I· get on 
welfare. I don't like it, but 
until the kids get older, that'l 
the way it has to be. So I go in 
dressed like I'm having a 
helluva good time. I don't 
mind rubbing it in their faces. 
I enjoy it." 

"But I don't have to use 
the beast often, not the way I 
did when I was working," she 
says. "I spent five bucks a 
day getting back and forth to 
a job that only paid $2.90 an 
hour, for six hours time put 
in." Diapers and other baby 
IUpplies, repairs and other 
expenJell eat up most of the 
$70 that remains. 

"But a job costs money," 
she pointed out. "Transport-
ation, lunches, child care _. 
I'd have to clear three times 
what I'm making now just to 
break even." 

And 10, for her, welfare ia 
the ticket for passage 
through a period in life that 
one 01 her contemporaries, a 
youth on probation, caD "the 
Nuthin' Years." It's a time 
that'a "like waiting for a bus," 
another youth explains . 
You're through school --
probably because you 
dropped out _. but you're not 
into a real job yet. You're 
waitins, a.nd meanwhile you 
pa .. the time. 

"We're not al idle as the 
newspaper editorials make it 
seem -- we just live 
differently," says Celia 
Collis, t 9, of Chico, an on-
and·off-on welfare mother, 
who occasionally goes to 
collqe. 

"Instead of having RVs 
and jacuzzis, we bunch 
together and backpack, have 

parties, rebuild old cars and 
motorcycles. Some of us go 
to school, others work 
whenever IOIIlething comes 
up. Restaurant jobs, the nut 
hou.es (almonds and 
walnuts are grown around 
Chico), yard work. It's not a 
bad life. really. We have lots 
of time for sharing." 

As Collis sees it, she lives 
in "a cultural bottleneck" that 
exists because the job market 
cannot absorb everyone 
ready to enter it. 

Unlike the counter-culture 
of a decade ago, this 
subculture is not motivated 
by a rejection of mainstrea.m 
values. Once a job that 
seems reasonable comes 
through, most of these young 
people climb right into the 
mainstream. 

George Cuccja, a ' high 
school drop out with a 
juvenile record, for instance , 
hitchhiked from New Jersey 
to California nine years ago, 
hung around San francisco 
Bay area for a while, then 
drifted north to GroVllle, a 
town of 10,000 on ·the edge 
of the Sacramento Valley. 
where inexpensive old 
housing and a tolerance ··for 
lOkid ·row, and migratory 
workers had fOltered . an 
active youth subculture. _ 

Cuccia worked a s. a part-
time dishwashe.r and 
seasonal cannery worker , 
took on odd chores and spent 
his free time communally. He 
played in day-long pick-up 
basketball and softball 
games, drunk, smoked , 
played pool and puttered 
around with refrigerators, 
motorcycles, and garage sale 
furniture. . 

Cuccia's ~washing led 
to a job a. a cook. Then. 
through a softball teammate. 
he was hired by a 6rm that 
auernbled mobile homes. 
The hard, outdoor work 
suited him. Within six 
months he rose from being a 
$3.50 an hOl!r w~e earner, 
to foreman , bought a two-
year old van and applied for 
a loan to buy a two-bedroom 
home. He and the daughter 
of a local contrador now live 
together and raile registered

Iranian Schism? Iran 'Accountable' Near Miss Over SD 

ISTANBUL - Islamic student militants, 
declaring they take orders onlY from the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini and the Iranian people, rejected 
a suggeltion by Iranian officialll yesterday that the~ 
free their women and black hostages at the US 
EmballY in Tehran. 

\t was the latest sign of a major . split between 
Iranian authorities and hundreds of students who 
have been holding about 60 American and more 
than 30 non-American hostages since seizing the 
embassy Nov. 4. 

As the students reaffirmed their demand for 
extradition of Shah. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, US 
and other diplomats huddled at the United Nations 
over the Iran crisis. 

President Carter, who has banned Iranian oil 
imporll and frozen Iranian government a.sets in the 
United States, said in a speech yesterday to an AfL-
CIO convention in Washington that he was holding 
Iranian authorities "fuUy responsible" for the safety 
of the hoatages. 

They will be held accountable," he declared in a 
speech interrupted repeatedly by loud applause and 
whistles. 

Egyptians Get Sinai 
MOUNT SINAI, E,ypt - Israel ended its 12-

year occupation of this area Thursday and returned it 
to Egypt, whose soldiers hoiated their black -white-red 
flag near the mountain where Moses is said to have 
received the Ten Commandments. 

In ceremoniel at an airstrip within view of the 
2,285-foot peak, Israeli soldiers pulled down the.tar 
of David banner two month. ahead of achedule . 

Egyptian Brig. Cen. Seif eI Bin Abu Snaf, in a brief 
lpeech, pointed to the early withdrawal as proof we 
are moving ahead" and as evidence which disproves 
all the lies and hatred of the rejection front." 

WASHINGTON - President Carter said 
yesterday the Iranian government is "fully 
responsible" for the safety of about 60 Americans 
held hostage in the US Embassy in Tehran and "wiD 
be held accountable." 

Carter, in his harshest statement about the actions 
of Iranian leaders in the 12.day·old crisis, said he 
found it unthinkable that any "responsible 
government" would try to pressure another nation by 
using diplomats as barter. 

Addressing the convention of the AFL-CIO, the 
president said the seizure of the embassy and the 
Americans stationed there violated basic principles 
of international la w. He vowed that the students 
occupying the embassy will not sway American 
policy. 

This is an act of terrorism totally outside the 
bounds of international law and diplomatic 
tradition," Carter liaid. "lbis crisis calls for firmness 
and relOtraint." 

Meany Leaves Post 
WASHINGTON - George Meany, the ~ruff 

and powerful voice for a generation of working 
people, bade a tearful goodbye to his ''house of 
labor" yesterday with a call lor new leaders and 
policies to keep the AFL-CIO in step with the 
changing world. 

'Tbe AfL-CIO, which Meany helped forge in 
1955 and ruled ever since. is alive and well," the 
retiring 85.year-old labor leader said in a farewell 
address to an emotion.swept federation convention. 

But the labor movement cannot be content with 
defending the statu. quo or reliving past idories," said 
Meany, who long has been criticized for fail~ to 
keep the AFL-CIO up with changing times. 'We 
must cOnstantly look to the future , develop new 
leadership, adapt policies to changing conditionli and 
new technologies."

ANAHEIM - A-panel of doCtors, nervous about 

reports that two drink. a day may protect against 
heart attack, say» the risk of a1coholilllt i. too glUt to 
justify every recommending liquor to non-drinkers. 

"I can't see us ever telling someone to start 
drinking to ~otect hi. heart. It's just too rillcy," Dr. 
Wdliam P. Castelli of the National Heart,l.ung and 
Blood In.titute said Thursday. 

"You might teU somebody who is prone to 
alcoholism and that would destroy hi. whole life and 
hil family." 

The problem, he said, is that many people limply 
will not be able to take two drinks a dar and then 
stop. He cited proven health hazards 0 exceuive 
drinking and said the United States already has about 
17 million akoholica. 

But the three doctor., speaking at a new.

The biggest injustice is that 
the Mother Puckers were 
denied a playoff bid. A lack of 
organization in the begiMing 
of the quarter cost the team 
two early Ioase~. With an 0·2 
record coming into the final

and brought a tough team to

Beer Makers Like 
Intramural Forum 

By Barbara Haa. 
Staff Writer 

Intramural athletes know that a beer after an exhausting 
game i. a good thirst quencher. Several beer companies want 
that polt·game brew to be their own brand, and the 1M program 
provides a profitable forum for their promotions. 

For the past four years, Budweiser and Miller beer promotion 
programs have each had some role in the success of the 1M 
program. Lately Coors has also decided to support sports on 
campus. The strong yet subtle support of recreational athletics 
by beer companies occurs not only at UCSD but at USD, UC 
Irvine, UCLA, and to even a greater extent at San Diego State 
and other school •. 

Miller has sponsored an intramural team of the week, 
intramural volleyball tournaments, and an 1M football game of 
the week televised at the P!lb. Budweiser finances the Bud Page 
in The Daily Guardian, an aMual "Super Sports" Competition, 
and the calendars given out by the intramural program. 
Lowenbrau Ilponsors a surfing contest in the spring and an over 
the line tournament. These projects could not ha ve been feasible 
without some sort of outside support. 

This started four years ago when a representative from one of 
the companies came into the Intramural office with an idea to 
help out the 1M pro1{ram and at the same time advertille "the 
great taste ot Hud." ~ince then, Miller hal also become involved,

'Bud Page' a Product 
of 1M, Beer Needs Shielders Advance 
Continued (rom IJOge 6 
although it appears now that it is backing out of the pro,..arn. 
Coors is now starting to .how an interest in intramurals. 

Mike Hipp, Director of Intramural Sports, explained the 
origin of the two.year-old Bud Page, the Wednesday 
advertieement in The Daily Guardian with intramural results, 
ranking., and Recreation Special Events. "Three years ago one 
of my friends who works at SDSU was a market researcher for 
Bud during the summer. He was also involved with the 
intramural program at State. Well , he arranged to have 
Budweiser sponsor some sort of ~imonthly coverage of the 
int.ramural program. They weren't really getting adequate 
coverage from the paper then. At the time, we weren't either. So, 
I talked to Bill Shiner (the sales manager for Budweiser) and 
worked out a deal where they would sponsor bimonthly 
coverage (or us too." 

Hipp takes charge of writing the Bud page, which costs the 
Budweiser co~pany $180 every two weeks. This paid 
advertisement allows every intramural sport some type of 
coverage while quietly plugging the name of Budweiser. Hipp 
writes most of the page himself, although some members of the 
recreation staff occasionally act as contributing editors for the 
Pop Top Comer column. 

Hipp and Scolt Berndes, the Assistant 1M Director, both 
reject the notion that the connection between be~r companies 
and Intramurals is detrimental to the image of the sport. "The 
companies aren 't trying to get people who don't drink beer to go 
and buy some. They're just saying that if you do drink beer, why 
not drjnk their's next time you buy some?" said Hipp. 

The liason between Budweiser and UCSD, Larry Varni , feels 
~hat no moral issue exists with beef supporting college sports. 

By Tun Liotta 
Staff Writer 

The Anistropic Shielders 
asserted themselves as the 
team to beat for the coed AA 
football title with a ' 48·0 win 
last Sunday in the first round of 
the playoffs. ' 

Three other teams remain, 
all of which come off big 
victories in their first round of 
the~layoffs . 

The Shielders, coed champs 
for two years running, 
absolutely submerged 
Squiggy and Squirmy, 48·0. 
The display of sheer 
dominance had onlookers 
shaking their heads in awe. 
Though the Shielders had won 
all of their regular season 
games, they really hadn't lived 
up to expectations. 

The defense was impene. 
trable as lhey held their 
opponents to minus ten yard3 
in total offense, rivaling the 
Los Angeles Rams perfor· 
mance of just a week ago. The 
secondary picked off five 
passes, returning four of them 
for touchdowns. 

While the offense has been 
powerful , as usual, the 

defense has been somewhat 
questionable. This was the 
team's first shutout, which if 
nothing like the defense of the 
Shielders in the past. They 
seemed to have come together 
just in time. 

Cruise·a ·Matic showed as 
much firepower as the 
Shielders, as they belited 40· 
13. Cruise·a·Matics' offense is 
run by Bob Mulick and 1M 
director Mike Hipp, and it 

utilizes all seven members of 
the squad . The defense boasts 
a balanced attack that has few 
weaknesses. 

To say that Cruise·a·Matic 
is 1M's own team would be an 

-

reatNew-s 

understatement. Besides 
Hipp, team members Erin, 
Ahem and Bob MuJick are 
sports alliistants. Jennifer 
Johnson and Glenn Calla are 
hockey referees and Janae 
Askew is a football referee. 
Only Cary Lindstrom remains 
a deparbnent outsider. 

Of . the four teams in the 
semi.finals, no team utilizea 
the long bomb as effectively as 
More Better Hands. In their 

36·20 win over the Blue 
Bombers they scored from 45, 
50 and 60 yard. away. They 
are a potential threat from any 
part of the field.

UCSD's Best Team Ever? 
Basketball Season One Week . Away 

J. RiP, Sliaht 
The men's basketball team 

is only one week away from 
what could be it. beit teaIOn 
ever. 

The coach and many of the 
players are new to UCSD, but 

the talent level aurpaue. pa.t 
Triton tearn •. 

"We have the beat talent in 
the history 01 the achool. There 
is no queation that thi. wiD be 
the most exciting team UCSD 
hat ever had," .aid Ron 

Carter, the new coach of the 
team. 

In the past, Carter has 
desillned team Itrategie. 
around the individual sicilia of 
hi. player •. nul year he feels 
that the players are good 
en(),J.Igh to make this kind of 
.ystem work. 

"We wiD have an exciting 
.style of play. The defense will 
be preuing full court 
constantly. 'The offense will be 
geared towards fast breaks on 
every play. The entire team is 
going to be moving 
continuously," he said. 

"Almost every team has 
those one or two exciting 
players. Someone that can 

. create electricity in the crowd, 
a 'Dr. J.' or a Uoyd Free for 
example. Our ball·team has 
five players that can create this 
excitement ." 

Guard Nate forte, forwards 
AI Winters and Gary Haynes, 
and center Sherman Johnson, 
all have the ball control and 
skill to lead the team. 

The team exhibits sharp 
outside shooting, but suffer 
one serious flaw: size. 

Center Sherman Johnson is 
only 6'5", small by college 
standards. The rest of the 
players range from 5'8" to 
6'5" 

"Our stronge~t point is 
quicknelli. This is the quickest 
team UCSD has ever had," 
said Carter. "Our weakest 
point is height. A tradition at 
UCSD." 

Saturday. 
Saturday'slaugher of a win 

over Miramar came mostly 
without the usual five starters. 
Within 10 minutes of the start 
of the game, Carter replaced 
the regular team with second· 
string athletea. 

'These players also proved 
too much for Miramar, and by 

the end of a regulation time 
period they had swamped the 
opposition 125-72. Scrim-
mage games UluaUy con. It of

Net Wits, Pig Dogs 
Favored in AAA 

By Barbara Haas 
Staff Writer 

This Sunday all the drama of three-on·three basketabll wiu 
come to an end. Three new champions (one from each league) will 
be crowned. , 

The mam purpose of the 3 ·on·3 is to have fun. In addition to 
enjoyment however, this type of game is a preparation for a 
more serious program of regulation basketball in winter quarter . 
F'ive-on-five ball involves not only more players, but real live 
referees. Scott Berndes, assistant director of Intramural sports, 
said that "three on three basketball is more of a Il~iltleman's 
game. There are no referees. The guys mainly ius! .:all thei~ own 
fouls and go by the rules. We hope." 

The playoffs started two weeks ago. The AAA and A leagues 
use a double elimination format because of the low number of 
teams. Due to the large number of teams in the Air league, 
competition is broken into two parts. Teams with a record better 
than .500 play for one championship, and the teams with records 
below .500 playa separate tournament. These playoffs are based 
on four member pool play, 

'The mOllt impressive team is the Net Wits, currently undefeated 
at 18·0. Pi$l DollS Allain came in second at 16-2. and behind 
them are the B-4 Dunkers and the Hooterville Express, both with 
12·2 records. All these teams are lrom the AA league.

The Tritons are 6·1 in their 
pre· season scrimmages this 
year including a 178·117 
victory over Miramar 

A high up authority in the Intramural Office, who desires to be 
known only as "The Czar ," had a few predictions as to the winners 
of the championships. For the AAA league, 4 Score seems like a 
good bet. In the over .5000 part of AA.. Oriental Fetishes wiU pull 
an upset ana capture the title. 3 Ronin has the under .500 half 
secured. In A, look to the Cha~pagne Kid. to take everything.

'No Man's Land' is Pinteresque 
By Wdliam Gibson 

Senior Staff Writer 
The Marquis Public 

'Theater is continuing its '79· 
'SO season with a production 
of Harold Pinter's No Man's 
lAnd. The play is exemplary 
of Pinter's work, fusing many 
of his themes and methods into 
a coherent whole, and the 
Marquis production, with a 
few exceptions, is faithful to 
the author's intent 

sightleuly ahead . Robert 
Mc Kenna · is superb as Hirst. 
frail , ghostly, terrifyingl,Y 
senile, and James Manley s 
waspy, ferret·like Spooner is 
also excellent. 

Hirst's private secretary, the 
latter his Black cook. They are 
immediately suspicioull of 
Spooner's intentions; thus 
beginll a sinister pas de quatre, 

·with each man for himself, 
forming temporary alliances to 
his need •. 

for the position of secretary to 
Hirst, the atmosphere 
becomes thick with innuendo 
and psychic gamesmanship 
(uncoincidentally, the 
characters~ names are those of 
famous cricketers.) Dale 
Turner and Thomas Sesma 
play Briggs and Foster to the 

hilt, particularly Sesma; his 
malignant insolence and 
domineering manner of 
dealing with Spooner and 
Hirst convey the character's 
nature perfectly. Turner's 
Briggs is much the same, and 
together their abusiveness is 
quite funny, in a twisted, 
cerebral way. 

Pinter is one of the brightest 
star. in contemporary British 
theatre. Though labeled by his 
detractors as an imitator of 
Beckett , lonesco and 
Simpson, Pinter has achieved 
ever-increasing critical and 
popular acclaim for his work 
since the premiere of his first 
play, The Room, in 1957. 
Unlike the above authors he 
grounds his plays in the seedy 
West End of London. He 
explores the shrouded psyches 
of that quarter's denizens 
rather than, as with Beckett, 
the depths of the author's self 
and the futitity 01 language . 

Into the arena come Hirst's 
purported servants foster and 
Briggll, the former a poet and As foster and Spooner vie 

Pinter's work, in many 
ways, bring. po.t-war 
European theatre full circle, by 
placing the action in the real 
world. Still, the plays are 
hardly naturalistic. Pinter's 
briltiant use of language, hi. 
juxtaposition of psychotic 
babbling and silence work with 
devastating effect when done · 
right, and there is no question 

\ that under Minerva Marqui.' 
direction, this production is 
right. However, the IIUCCes. is 
Ielliened by the theater itself. 
Several time; during the~a 
ventilator started up, . a 
racket which diapelled 
play's atmosphere, and the 
luminous Exit signs on either 
side of the stage are no help 
either. Also, the set de.go iut 
best distracting, ea~ially the 
large trellis suspended over the 
stage. Pinter's plays stand on 
characters and word., and 
such conceptual touches are 
entirely unnecessary. 

No Man 's Land moves out 
of the West End and into the 
suburban home of Hirst, an 
aging author, who enters with 
Spooner, presumably a guest. 
Much of the first act is a 
dialogue between these two, so 
shifting and elliptical that one 
has difficulty establishing the 
relationship between the two; 
are they friends, rivals, or do 
they know each other at all? 
Spooner abuses his lIenescent 
host roundly, downing hill 
booze as the other stares 

""010 by w ..... TnilNft RoIM, ,,7t. 

By and large, however, the 
Marquis production is 
excellent; it' ll not Richardson 
and Gielgud at the Old Vic, 
but a good production of 
Pinter', work is rare enouah 
anywhere, and definitely 
worth the time and money

A Pu~ Pop Advance 

Lo\Ve's Labour of Lust Herculean 
By Ted Burke 

AI'b Editar 
Labour 01 Lu.t·Nick Lowe 
(Columbia) 

Peter T 0WIIIeIIIf coined the 
now.popuIar term "Power-

raucous rock backbeat. " 

That was over ten year. 
ago, and Townsend'. 
c:omate, IIItended no doubt as 
a throwaway term like those 

elements of conceptual 
sophiatication wherein , Lowe 
take. a cue from other artists

abounding in enthu.ia.tic 
chats about pop culture, baa 
been lifted frOm abeyance and 
has now aettIed finnJy in the 
lingo 01 the 70s rock critic. 

Spearheading the new 
Power-pop movement is Nick 
Lowe. 

Lowe, a founding member . 
and aonpriter in the l8d1y 
departed Brinzly Schwartz 
and beat known to rock fans .. 
Elvi. Costello'. producer, 
releuecl a record Iut year that 
laid out Lowe'. methodology 
in the tide: Pure Pop lor Now 
People. On one level, the tide 
was a perfect parody of the 
dumb product. record 
c:ampanies uaed to release for 
COIIIUIIIeI'S they perceived a. 
-. wiIIeu, gullible, and 
bereft of any .en.e of 
discrimination (i.e., Jackie 
GI.aaon PreunIa Maaic lor 
YOIIIII I...ot1ers, 1lw Ventures 
PIa" lite 8cdman Theme and 
Odter TV Hila). Yel on 
another level.. it reveal. an 

transformed them into objects 
of art. Lowe the conceptualist, 
wanting nothing to do with the 
priggiah high· toned preten· 
sions of "art-rock" (ELP and 
Kansas, let us I8Y, not Roxy 
Music or Steely Dan or Robert 
Fripp), nor with the knee-jerk 
anarchy' of most punk-rock 
aelal, wanted to produce a 
music that had the I8me clean, 
aeif-contained aesthetic values 
of the Beach Boys and the 
early Who, and yet retained a 
smart-aued, lOOt-noted, wise-
guy cynici.m. The result, Pure 
Pop, was just that: a 
amorgasbord of borrowed riffs 
and chord progressions, vocal 
arrangements lifted from any 
number of vocal bands from 
the 50., a plethora of musical 
styles that ranged from 
rockabiUy, boogie-blues, to 
Phil Spector. Pure Pop, 
though, was far from the 
Imockout it could have been. 
Lowe'a production wal 
cluttered and muddy, 'and 

except for lOme catchy tunes 
("Breaking Glall," UHeart of 
the City"), moat of the material 
was no more convincing than 
the average Sha-Na-Na 
sendup. Pure Pop, in general, 
waa contrived and too 
deliberate in execution, the old 
case of an arti.t being more 
interelted in form than 
content. 

Lowe, ~gh,hasmadea 
sizable step forward with his 
new record, lAbour 01 Lust. 
Like PUre Pop, the record is a 
melange of contrasting styles 
and attitudes where Lowe 
demonstrates an impre55ive 

charaeler and nerve. Lowe'. 
new material sounds better as 
well. The lOngS are better 
arranged, sound more 
complete, Sound more like real 
songs rather than effete 
parodies. Lowe's humor i. set 
in a aharper context. "Big 
Kick, Plain Scrap," featuring 
one of those Jamea-Brown-
style basslines that defines the 
ellence of funk , is ove.rlaid 
with a mumbling, sleepy 
voiced vocal that uUers a word 
salad of lyrics sounding like 
Captain Beefheart (if the 
Captain were the lyricist for 
K.C. and the Sunshine Band). 
"Dose of You," a pielure-

Lowe, the conceptualist, wanted 
nothing to do with the priggish, 
high toned pretentions of "art rock" 

knowledge of hackneyed pop. 
music forms. Lust, though, 
fares much beUer. Lowe's 
production is sparer this time, 
unenclBl\hered by unlimited 
overdubs or an excess of 
in.truments. The musicians on . 

. the tracks (uimamed on the 
jacket,' though I suspect it's 
Dave Edn'llUlds and Rockpile, 
whom Lowe lours with) lOund 
like a unified band, a unit 
who've worked out the 
particulan_ of each song, and 
gave performancea that, unlike 
the previous album, have 

perfec t Buddy Holly 
emulation, puns relentlessly 
about VD, mixing up the tired 
theme of a young man trying 
to woo a woman with a seldom 
spoke element of what can 
happen with love. 

Lowe remains, in my opinion, 
a bright minor talent who has 
yet to show that he can break 
out of his narrow confines, but 
the improvement on Lust 
indicated that hili will be a 
career that'll warrant 
a.ltention .

Animated Films for Fun, Not Profit 

Why Do You Think It's Called A Festival? 
By Beth Haas 

The Festival of Animation comes to 
UCSD this weekend bringing with it 
nine premeire shows, and several 
Academy Award Winners for Best 
Animated Short Film. Mike Gribble, 
and his partner Spike Decker , along 
with othr friends compose Mellow 
Manor, a production company which 
promotes various plays, bands, and 
any other 'group they feel like 
promoting. They've been promoting 
for ten years . 

" If we like it, if it's fun, we'll do it," 
says Gribble. He stresses that the 
whole idea behind the Festival of 
Animation or any promotion is not to 
make money, but to have fun. " We do 
make money, '1 mean, it is our 
existence, but it's not exactly a job, it's 
not work! " 

The reason behind their appearance 
at UCSD is that Greenpeace, an

ecology.minded organization, hired 
them, Mellow, Manor, as a fund· 
raising engagement. Though the 
profits and percentage figures were not 
available, Gribble litressed that this and 
all agreements made with Mellow 
Manor are infonnal, "just a handshake 
deal . You know, just something friends 
do for friends . Mellow Manor 

. Promotions are ba.ed in Riverside, but 
bring their productions to Los Angeles, 
San Luis Obispo, La Jolla and other 
places in California. 

Gribble and Decker composed the 
1980 Festival of Animation from films 
recommended by former patrons, or 
from works of producers that they 
know, or from distributors or films that 
they already own. Gribble mentions 
that although there is no certain criteria 
for accepting or rejecting a film, the 
bottom line "is that the person gets a 
little bit more than the ticket price. We 

try as much as possible to contain 
variety - different themes, some 
abstract, surreal, light and fun." . 
Gribble stresses that the 1980 festival 
of Animation is new, and diHerenl, with 
nine films never before seen in San 
Diego County, some of which are 
recently released as candidates for 
Academy AwarcLi. 'The other seven 
shows that complete the entourage are 
tried and true favorites. 

Special Delivery, by Eunice 
McCauley and John Weldon of 
Canada is a black humor piece andthe 
most recent Academy Award winner. 
It is unusually done with single 
drawings and clever dissolves from 
scene to scene. Animalion Potpourri, 
Parts I and II, are a collection of 
entertaining hitson-pieces of other 
media formats , such as international 
television commercials, and the ends of 
some American movies. Closed 

Monday "is a classic," says Gribble. 
It's done with clay with stop-action 
photography, a much more 
IOphi.ticated version of the old 
"Gumby" cartoons. Sysiphu$ is done 
with a brush.and-ink 1Iyle, and is based 
on the myth of the f11im who was 
condemned forever to push a rock 
aImoat all the way up a steep hm. only 
to have it roll back again. "It give 
immediate response - you react, and 
than it's gone," remarks Gribble. 
Grapefruit Coconul, similar to Melon 
Madness shown previously at 
Sherwood Hall in La Jolla . 

Gribble stre51eS the importance of 
buying advance tickets, which may be 
purchased at the Central Box Office. 
Tickelli are $3 in advance and $3.50 
at the door. The shows will ·be at 6,8 
and 10 pm Friday and Saturday and at 
2,6,8 and 10 pm on Sunday at TLH

the three speaking rolea went 
to Tun Weske, David Harris 
and Tun Evans. Christensen 
abo recruited fellow student 
I,(ip Martin to write an original 
score for the film, and Larry 
Hoagland to work as 
cameraman. 

Christensen ' , primary 
reason for making this film is 
that he wants a finished 
product to show organizati~ns 
of his future projecta is a black 

, and white, film noir style 
detective story set in 
contemporary San Diego. His 
pet project , however, i. an 
eerie tale entitled The Watch 
for which he needs a $20,000 
budget. Ideally, he would like 
to use The Watch to revive the 
old Twilight Zone television 
aeries. 

Additionally, Christen.en 
has considered entering No 
Tune For Honor in film 
festivals but he baa made no 
demite plana in this area. 

No nme For Honor is beio,r 

produced by Chris tensen 
under his own company , 
Pul.tar Productions. He 
established the company for 
"media produ~s" and not 
juat film production. became 
he wanta to "work in fea ture 
films, commercials, video, 
photography and special 
effects." He and Alan Pace, a 
partner in Pulstar Productions, 
have already designed 
miniatures which have been 
bought for use in the upcoming 
film, Monument. 
Christensen is also working on 
a number of ideas for 
commericals. He says: " I want 
to prove that commercials can 
be done with clan." He has 
plana for commercials on Del 
Mar, Disneyland and the 
California Highway Patrol 
and he hopes to be able to fibn 
these commercials himself. 

Although No nme For 
Honor represents his lint 
16mm eHOt1. Christensen has 
had years of experience with 

other types of media 
production . During his 
sophomore year at a Min· 
neapolis high school, he 
worked for public accell 
televiaion on sporta program. 
and on a show called Career 
Comer. After moving to .San 
Diego in 1977, he received a 
job as a IIpecial effects 
technician at the Reuben H. 
Fleet Center. 

Christensen , a South· 
western College student who 
plans to transfer to UCSD, has 
a positive attitude toward 
school and plans to get a PhD 
in Visual Arts. " I wiU always 
be going to school and 
learning," he says , "so I might 
as well make it add up to a 
degree. " He says he wanta a 
PhD 10 as to have the option of 
teaching. He says that he 
enjoys talking to people about 
media production and would 
eventually like to teach on a 
part time ba.is.

Aaaemblyman Howard 
Berman (Los Angele.) last 
year permitted collective 
bargaining in the UC system. 

Once a union becomes 
certified, "the university has 
the legal obligation to deal with 
us in good faith/, Chri.tensen 
say •. 

AFSCME "has received the 
.trongest support (from non· 
faculty workers) in the UC 
.y.tem ... we have a reputation 
for effectiveness in represent·· 
ing employees in complex 
in.titutions such as the 
university," he adds. 

AFSCME - the only AFL· 
CIO unit in the UC system-
claims to represent nearly 
100,000 university em· 
p10yees nationwide.

State Employees Association 
are also seeking support 
systemwide, a study 
conducted through the 
university of California says 
AFL·CIO units - like 
AFSCME - have out· 
negotiated other employee 
associations. 

This study, the first 
intensive analysis of contracts 
negotiated by local govern· 
ment employees in the 10 
years since gaining the right to 
bargain, was conducted by 
UC's California Public 
Employee Relations Program 
of the Institute of Industrial 
Relations at Berkeley. 

"Although AFL·CIO 
affiliates are responsible for 
negotiating only 40 percent 01 

the agreements in the sample 
(either alone or in joint 
bargaining councils with a 
nonaffiliated organization), 
they are responsible for 58' 
percent of the agreements 
which cover nine or 10 of the 
basic topics," the study said. 

The 1 7 basic topics used to 
measure comprehensiveness 
of agreements included: 
wages; health care benefits; 
hours 'Of work and overtime 
pay; paid holidays, vacation 
and sick leave; grievance 
procedures; organizational 
security; and personnel 
actions, layoffs, transfers and 
promotions. . 

Independent employee 
associations negotiated 54 
percent of the agreements. 

Faculty Survey

. education because of it? When they built the new academic unit 
at Third College did they build more classrooms? No, not one 
classroom for students. .) bey are building monuments to 

~m~lves, where UCSD profes.ors can churn out scholarly 
academia in order to prove their existence to the university 
administration, while the .tudents get less than 20 percent of 

, their time. 
Attesting to this, a sample survey of last year's freshmen on all 

UC campuses showed that UCSD ranked the lowest in the 
category of faculty.student interaction. Only 48 percent of the 
students were satialied with their contact with faculty at this 
campus. 

It is not the professors who are to blame, but the UCSD 
administrative system that is not committed to or interested in 
teaching students in an environment that facilitates learning and 
personal growth. Rather it is trying to produce specialized, 
mechanical non·thinkers (and they deceivingly call us students) 
who would go through this institution without a whimper about 
the injustices that beset them. It is time that this so-called UCSD 
"education system" stopped turning its back on students and 
offered a credible learning environment for students.
