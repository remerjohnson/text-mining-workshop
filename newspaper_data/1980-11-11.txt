yesterday's Ead Warren Memorial Symposium on 
"Conll'ess and the American Constitutional Syatem." 

Civil rights topic at 
Warren sytnposiutn 

BY JOHN BRICE 
• Staff Writer 

Calling civil rights "an act of faith " on the part of the 
American people, Professor Harold Hyman said yeterday he 
hoped there would be a "continuance of the concern" that 
the American people have shown for their civil rights. 

Hyman, a history professor at Rice University, was one 
of the main speakers at the Earl Warren Memorial 
Symposium, held yesterday at various locations around 
campus. "Congress and The American Constitutional 
System" was the topic of this year's symposium, directed 
Dr. Harry Scheiber of the UCSD history department. 

The purpose of the lectures was to "take a topic of major 
public importance and bringing scholars and students 
together to discuss it," according to Scheiber. 

Over 100 high school students from the San Diego area 
were invited and asked to join in a question and answer 
session following the lectures. 

Opening the talk on Congress and civil rights was 
Professor Paul Murphy, from the University of Minnesota. 

. He discussed the importance of studying the Constitution, 
contending that it provides "a c1ea.r vision of where 
America has been, and hopefully a knowledge of where we 
are going." 

Hyman, the main 'speaker on the Constitution and 'its 
relation to civil rights, centered his talk on the period 
immediately following the Civil War. He emphasized the 
difficulty that the federal govemmet faced in en,forcing the 
Civil Rights Act of 1866. 

"National government had ' no experience with 
implementing civil rights on the state governments," said 
Hyman. He added that the federal government had to deal 
with a "thousand communities, not just a few states." 

Hyman criticized former President Andrew Johnson for 
being as "imperial as Richard Nixon" in his disregard of the 
law, refering toJohnson's lack of enforcement of civil rights 
laws. Hyman applauded Dr. Martin Luther King for 
promoting public mvolvement, resulting in "an education 
of the congressmen on problems they would haveotherwi e 
ignored." 

The symposium was co-sponsored by Warren College 
and Project 87, an academic agency that i funding 
fellowships and conferences to mark the U Con t itutional 
Bicentennial. Six other 'peaker during the ymposium 
discu sed different aspect of the Con titution and it

Vice chancellor Johnson 
ok's proposal to cut buses 

Lines 30, 301 stay; 21, 41 rerouted 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

A880ciate N eW8 Editor 
If San Diego Transit 

agrees, campus bus serviGe 
will be significantly cut 
beginning in January. 

A proposal to reduce noise 
and congestion along Myers 
Drive, in front of the 
Bookstore, by re-routing two 
SDTC lines around that 
stretch was yesterday given 
the administrative nod by 
Vice Chancellor of Budget 
Affairs Herm Johnson. 

The proposed change will 
be submitted to DTC for 
approval early this week by 
the Parking and Transporta-
tion Office. 

The proposal is a 
compromise between admini-
strators trou bled by the noise 
made by buses along Myers 
Drive, and students and 
others dependent on those 
buses for transportation to 
and from campus. The 
change will not affect SDTC 
line 30 or North County 

Fortner EOP head 
Byrd leaves UCSD 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
New Editor 

UCSD Community Rela· 
tions Director William Byrd, 
a former director of the 
campus Educational Oppor-
tunity program, resigned 
Friday, an administration 
source said yesterday. 

Byrd was unavailable for 
comment , but OASIS 
Director Ken Majer, Byrd's 
associate, confirmed the 
resignation, saying that Byrd 
cited "personal reasons" and 
a desire to purS'ue a higher 
university degree as his 
reasons for leaving. 

Officials in the Staff 
Personnel Office refused to 
release details of the 
resignation. 

Byrd came to the forefront 
of university politics last 
year when he was forced to 
step down as EOP head. 
Criticism that he was 
responsible for the low 
number of minorities 
recruited at UCSD precipi-
tated that resignation. 

philosophy is still with us," 
Herrera, referrin~ to the low 
number of minonty students 
EOP produced this year. The 
main problem he sees is 
"Byrd's belief that students 
should stay out of recruit-
. " mg. 

Herrera said only 181 
minority students were 
recruited through EOP this 
year, typifying the need for a 
revamped program that 
would involve "peers" in 
canvassing state high schools 
for eligible minority 
students. 

As part of a reorganization 
plan to make minority 
recruitment more effective, 
EOP and the office of 
Academic Support for 
Instructional Services were 
moved from the control of the 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs tothe Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs. 

At the time of the.. 
reorganization, Byrd moved 
from EOP to Community 
Relations to "ease the 
tension" between him and 
his superiors, an administra-
tion official said. 

Transit line 301. 
SDTC lines 21 and 41, 

however, will skirt the 
campus. The 21 line from 
Mira Mesa, which parking 
office officials say "would 
have changed anyway due to 
trouble with connections 
downtown," will now come 
on campus only as far as the 
VA Hospital. The 21 bus will 
then travel north on 
Highway 5 to its final 
destination , Sorrento Valley. 

Line 41 , from Fashion 
Valley via Genesses Ave., will 
travel down Gilman Drive to 
the VA Hospital, then 
bact rack, circling the Warren 
College Apartments heading 
towC\rd Scripps Hospital 
along Old Mira Mesa Road. 

. "It seems fair to me," 
Assistant Chancellor Patrick 
Ledden said yesterday of the 
proposal. "We're retaining 
appropriate bus service while 
cutting down on the noise 
and congestion posing a 
problem for many now." 

Nearly 128 buses currently 
pass through Myers Drive 
between 8 am and 5 pm 
weekdays, the hours most 
administrat ive . offices along 
that stretch are open. Under 
the new schedule, only 72 
buses will go by during that 
same period, according to 
.Parking and Transportation 
Office Manager Bob Um-
stead. 

"Hopefully, this change 
will both meet the needs of 
those troubled by the noise, 
and students, staff and 
faculty who depend on buses 
for transportation," said 
Ledden. "But it's important 
to realize that nothing's 
concrete. If it is clear that 
people are not being served 
well between January and 
June, we can reconsider the 
service on campus and 
perhaps change things again 
by the beginning of fall

Student Affirmative 
Action Committee member 
Arturo Herrera said 
yesterday that he thought 
Byrd's resignation was 
"weird." "Somebody doesn't 
resign that quickly without 
some other factors," he said. 

But Third College Provost 
Joe Watson said he doubted 
that Byrd's resignation had 
anything to do with his 
former EOP affiliation. " I 
pon't think he's leaving 
discredited because he hasn't 
been responsbile for EOP for 
over a year." 

Errata 

And both Watson and 
Herrera agree that Byrd's 
resignation from EOP has 
made a little difference in the 
way UCSD minority recruit-
ment is run.

Quasi-alliances formed 
War of attrition is 
reshaping Mideast 

What began as a limited border conflict between Iran and 
Iraq is now threatening major changes in the political and 
ec<?nomi~ stability of the Middle East, affecting all the 
neaghboring states. The longer the war continues, the more 
profound the intpact of these changes will be and the greater 
the possibility of super-power involvement. 

A unique characteristic of the war until now has been that 
neith~ protagonist is a client state of either Moscow or 
WashlOgt~n. Although Iraq was counted as a Soviet agent in 
the past, It has souJht to steer a distinctly neutral policy in 
foreJgJl affairs and IOcrease its trade with the West since an 
alleged communist coup attempt was discovered in 1978. 
Determined to. beco":le a major power within t~e non-aligned 
movement - if not Its leader - Iraq deemed It expedient to 
lessen its ties to the Soviet Union. 

But as the war drags on, alignments indirectly involving 
the super-powers are beginning to crystallize, raising the 
danger that one or both super-powers will have to choose 
sides. 

The formation of these new alignments iltgan well before 
the current conflict. The power vacuum caused by the 
d~fall of th~ Shah, coupled with Iraq's desire to become the 
dORunant regIOnal power, led Iraq to form an alliance with 
two conservative monarchies and former arch-enemies, Saudi 
Arabia and Jordan. Within OPEC, Iran withdrew from the 

ca~p.of "price hawks" in favor of Saudi Ifolicies of moderate 
pnce JllCrease8 a~ no decreases in oil production.

because of its refusal to enter the Camp David accords 
Jordan's decision to throw its support to neighboring Iraq as ~ 
growi.ng military ~ .economic ~wer was natural. Iraq has 
contrIbuted ~ mdho~ annually to the Jordanian economy 
as well as offenng to budd a new road between theJordanian 
port of Aqaba and the Iraqi border. 

Although initially reluctant, Saudi Arabia has also found it 
in~easillJdy in its interests to link its fortunes with Iraq. The 
seIZure of the Grand Mosque of Mecca on November 22, 1979, 
the first day of the 15th century on the Muslim calendar, sent 
deep shudders through Saudi society. It confirmed Saudi 
fears that Iran's revolution would mean the Saudi's own 
downfall. Especially frightening was the possibility of a revolt

America's 'outlaw' ec{)nomy 
jobs for many, no protection 
SAN FRANCISCO, Ca. 

- Jerry is a house framer 
working in an exclusive 
suburban development near 
San Francisco Bay. He works 
under union contract, which 
requires a four-and-a-half day 
work week as an incentive for 
builders to hire more 
carpen ters. So once every two 
weeks, Jerry has what 
carpenters call a 'Black 
friday' - no work, no pay. 

The . economic 
pinch is leading to 
an epidemic of 
unofficial cash 
transactions des-
igned to cheat the 
IRS 

But Jerry and his fellow-
carpenters come to work 
anyway. They are paid "off 
the books" in cash, and spend 
much of the time hidin~ from 
the business rep of theIr own 
union. The framers don't 
declare the income, the 
contractor doesn't declare 
the wages and if the union 
doesn 't find out, everybody 
but Uncle Sam is happy. 

Jerry sometimes adds to his 
t ax- free earnings by 
moonlighting on weekends. 
He often spends the cash on 
tools he finds at a local flea 
market known to offer stolen 
goods. Some of the extra cas h 
also ends up in the pocket of a 
neighborhood drug dealer. 

Jerry is just one of millions 
of workers who depend partly 
or wholly on America's 
underground economy, a 
cash·only world of small 
entrepreneurs and independ-
ent workers that has grown 
in direct proportion to the 
"stagflation" eroding the US 
standard of living. The 
economic pinch is leading to · 
an epidemIC of unofficial cash 
transactions designed to 
cheat the IRS, union 
contracts, job health and 
safety requirements, immig-
ration officials - in short, 
anyone who might interfere 
with the slim profit margin 
on a small business. 

Defining the underground, 
or "outlaw" economy, 
however, is like the blind men 
describing an elephant - it 
all depends on which part you 
hold . Bartering and such 

Thomas Brom, economics 
editor for the Pacific News 
Service, wrote Ihis for PNS. 

illegal busineses as drugs, 
gambling and prostitution 
have C\lways existed at the 
margins of US society . So has 
moonlighting and tax 
evasion. What has changed is 
the amount of cash 
exchanges between hard-
pressed families and free-
lance service workers and the 
number of "outlaw" 
entrepreneurs operating in 
defiance of government or 
union regulation. 

The shadow economic 
system that is taking shape 
actually parallels the 
organized economy. Cutting 
class lines from the suburban 
cocaine dealer to the 
immigrant busboy, the 
underground is always illegal 
but not necessarily poor. And 
that is what worries the IRS. 

This spring the IRS 
released a study showing 
that individuals failed to 
report as much as $135 billion 
of taxable income for 1976. 
'These figures do not include 
income generated from 
bartering, white-collar crime 
or corporate tax evasion. Nor 
does it include the revenue 
loss from such common 
forms of tax cheating . as 
falsifying deductions and 
exemptions or phony tax 
shelters. 

Much has been made of the 
IRS report and the related 
work of economists Peter 
Gutman of the City 
University of New York and 
Edgar Feige of the University 
of Wisconsin. IRS studies 
have been used to bolster 
Gutmann's 1977 estimate of 
a $200 billion underground 
economy, and Feige's 
phenomenal $700 billion 
estimate - 30 percent of the 
present US gross national 
product . 

The'existence and size of 
the underground economy, 
however, is currently far less 
important than the lessons 
beIng drawn from its 
discovery. Gutmann and 
Feige believe the existence of 
a thriving cash economy 
proves that the above-ground' 
version is far healthier than 
government pundits allow. 
They claim that unemploy-
ment is significantly Jess 
than reported, the gross 
national product is signific-
antly more and taxes on 
individuals and corporations 
are too high to keep the public 
honest. 

The studies, based on 
circumstantial evidence 
"nllWllna an increase in cash 

relative to checking account 
deposits , are now being used 
to promote a highly debatable 
point - that capitalism 
works best without labor 
unions, job restraints, health 
and safety controls and 
government taxation . . 

In short, the very concept 
of the underground economy 
is being seized by free-market 
proponents intent on 
broadening laissez-faire 
economics. Nobel Prize-
winning economist Milton 
Friedman even chose a 
sweatshop in New York's 
Chinatown to show viewers 
of his television series "Free 
to Choose" how well the 
system works. 

Seen from the perspective 
of most American workers, 
however, the underground 
economy presents a dir~t 
threat to union wage and 
working conditions. Some 
unions, such as the 

Unemployment is 
significantly less 
than reported, and 
the gross national 
product is signifi-
cantly more. 
International Ladies' 
Garment Workers Union and 
the United Electrical 
Workers, have successfully 
organized urban sweatshops 
in Southern California. But 
many other unions seem 
paralyzed and perplexed by 
the rapid growth of both 
immigrant labor and non-
union small industry . 

In late September, for 
instance, directors of the 
United Auto Workers voted 
to end union backing for a 
one-year strike at the Vogue 
Coach plant in Southern 
California after providing 
only token support to the 
Mexican workers. "This only 
encourages company antI-
union drives," said striker 
Maria Castelanos. "Next 
time we'll know from the 

~nning not to listen to 
unton promises." 

The union must also cope 
with the attitudes of workers 
like Jerry, who participate in 
the underground economy' to 
get a little ahead, even If it 
undermines a union effort to 
provide jobs for more people. 

The construction and real 
estate industries in the Bay 
Area are rife with such 
workers - free-lance

US officials deliver 
'formal' reply to Iran 
ALGIERS, Algeria :-

Deputy Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher yester-
day turn over to Algeria's 
foreign minister the formal 
American reply to Iran's 
conditions for the release of 
the 52 hostages. US officals 
in Washington characterized 
the message as "positive." 

The American reply was 
kept secret, but the 
Washington officials said the 
diplomats were carrying a 

pled~e of non-intervention in 
Iran s internal affairs along 
with an explanation of the 
difficulties in meeting other 
terms. 

In Iran, President 
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said if 
the hostage crisis were 
resolved in a week 
resumption of arms supplie~ 
would help his country's war 
with Iraq. Iranian parliamen-
tary Speaker Hashemi 
Rafsanjani said, however 
that the United States should 
not expect any new moves 
from Iran regarding the 
hostages, according to the 
official Pars news agency. 

Th~ high-level party of five 
US dIplomats arrived in this 
north African country aboard 

a special Air Force plane, 
went directly to see US 
Ambassador Ulrich Haynes, 
then gave the American 
response to Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Benvahia for 
transmission to Iran. 

Algeria has been acting as 
intermediary between the 
United States and Iran , 
which severed diplomatic 
relations after Iranian 
militants overran the US 
Embassy in Tehran Nov. 4, 
1979, taking the hostages. 

It was not known if any 
Iranian officials were in 
Algiers, and officials of the 
US State Department in 
Washington said it was 
highly unlikely Christopher 
would meet with Iranian 
authorities. They did say the 
United States remains 
willing to hold face-ta-face 
talks. 

A US Embassy spokesman 
said Christopher delivered 
the reply personally "to 
explain to the government o( 
Alger~a sev~ral complex legal 
and fmanClal aspects" raised 
by the Iranian terms.

Voyager uncovers 
secrets of Saturn 

Many more rings found 
P ASADENA, Calif. AP 

- Voyager 1, speeding to its 
rendezvous with Saturn 's 
mysterious moon Titan, gave 
scientists yet another 
surprise yesterday with the 
discovery of a huge cloud of 
hydrogen gas surrounding 
the ringed planet. 

The hydrogen cloud forms 
a ring several hundred 
thousand miles thick around 
the planet, William Sandel of 
the University of Southern 
Califorinia told a news 
conference. He ' said the 
hydrogen apparently leads 
atom by atom from Titan's 
bizarre atmosphere, which 
seems to be mostly methane, 
or natural gas. 

• The presence of hydrogen 
in the atmosphere of Saturn 
has been known for some 
time, but wedidn't know ~ow 
this hydrogen, was distribu-
ted," he said . "The 
shape ... we actually saw 
doesn't conform well at all to 
what was expected " 

Scientists had anticipated 
a very narrow ring of gas 

- mostly restricted to the orbit 
of Titan, rather than · the 
broader cloud Sandel said. 
"This means some mechan-
ism, which we don't know, is 
operating to spread the 
hydrogen over a much larger 
region of space." 

Th~ gigan t ic cloud, he said, 
contruns only about 25,000 
tons of hydrogen . 

Scientists expected to 
learn more about the 

hy~rogen cloud as Voyager 
salls to scarely 2,500 miles of 

Titan late Tuesday on its 
way to a Wednesday close 
encounter with the ringed 
planet. 

The far-ranging spaceship, 
flying within two million 
miles of Saturn's churning 
yellow cloud tops yesterday, 
was for the first time 
revealing details on some of 
Saturn 's flock of 15 known 
moons. 

The ship's television eyes 
turned to the moon Dione and 
saw a huge starfish-like 
pattern spread over nearly 
one whole side of the moon . 

Also yesterday, a Voyager 
scien tist theorized Sa t urn's 
famous glimmering rings 
might contains dozens of 
moon lets that might cause 
their puzzling complexity. 

Instead of the traditionally 
counted six broad rings , 
Voyager is finding at least 
100 small but · distinct 
ringlet s of frozen debris 
reaching out from the planet. 

Torrence Johnson said the 
un s usr.ected structure 
means ' t he classical theories 
- that explain the rings 
through gravitational 
interactions with several 
known moons - are ~ing to 
have to be modified.' 

He said the recently 
discovered and still-unnamed 
15th moon of Saturn seems to 
control the outer edge of the 
most brilliant rings and 
"we'" be looking for small 
satellites - from about 5 to 
50 miles across - within the 
rings themselves. [t seems 
possible hundreds of bodies of 
major size could be in there."

Third plane 
linked to 
PSA crash· 

War attrition 
reshaping Mideast 

conti nued from page 2

SAN DIEGO AP - The 
Air Line Pilots Association 
said it has " posi tively 
confirmed" the presence of 
a third plane in the Pacific 
Southwest Airlines air 
collision that killed 144 
persons Sept. 25 , 1978 . . 

on its call earlier this year for an Arab National charter, 
through which all Arab states would eschew foreign bases on 
their soil and adopt a program of strict non· alignment. 

Registration for the 
plane, a Cessna 105, has 
been obtained and a search 
is underway for the pilot, 
said Harold Marthinsen, 

mana~er of accident 
investigations for the 
30,000 member group. 

Identification of the plane 
was made through radar 
data from the Federal 
Aviation Administration in 
Los Angeles and air traffic 
control tapes from Mont-
gomery Field, where the 
plane was based , Marthin-
sen said. 

The National Transpor-
tation Safety Board has 
been petitioned to repopen 
the case, he said. The 
morning accident over San 
Dei~o ranks as the worst air 
collision disaster in US 
history. 

The Boeing 727 jetliner 
was on final approach, less 
than two minutes from 
landing at Lindbergh Field , 
when it collided ~ith a 
single engine Cessna 172 
being used to train pilors. 
All 135 aboard the PSA jet 
died. along with two 
persons in the small plane 
and seven North Park 
residents. 

Marthinsen sa id the 
evidence indicatest that the 
PSA flight crew spotted the 
Cessna 105, and mistook it 
for the plane that air traffic 
controllers warned wa 

Thus, by the time of Iraq's attack on Iran, a strong alliance 
between [raq.Jordan and the Persian Gulf monarchies was in 
the making. All of the Persian Gulf states, including Oman, 
agreed to harbor Iraqi ships and fighter aircraft once the war 
was underway. 

At the same time, a new alignment was developing between 
Iran. Libya and Syria. Faced with mounti"¥ violence from the 
outlaw Muslim Brotherhood organization and political 
isolation within the Arab world, Syria's Hafiz al·Assad 
concluded a merger agreement with Libya shortly before 
Iraq's attack on Iran. With Jordan actively supporting the 
Brotherhood (Syrian commandos recently kidnapped 35 
Brotherhood members from Jordan) and now strollBly aligned 
with its arch·rival Iraq, the Syrian regime dropped its earlier 
reluctance and signed a friendship treaty with the Soviet 
Union. Together, Syria and Libya began an airlift of arms and 
supplies to Iran, and wounded Iranian soldiers 'were brought 
to Syrian hospltals for treatment. 

Thus, from a situation of relatively blurred lines at the 
beginning of the war, well·defined alliances have developed 
which link Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf 
monarchies to Iraq, while Syria and Libia are linked to Iran. 

Most disturbing is that in this process, both the United 
States and the Soviet Union have been drawn into the conflict. 
The US has indirectly become allied with Iraq with the 
dispatch to Saudi Arabia of four of its most sophisticated 
radar planes, other planes to refuel them, military technicians 
and a guided missile cruiser to protect Saudi oil fields from an 
Iranian attack. 

Although the Soviet Union has tried to remain neutral, its 
failure to openly support Iraq or to engage in a massive 
resupply of Iraqi armed forces, as well as a Soviet friendship 
treaty with Syria signed in the midst of war, has further 
strained Soviet relations with Iraq and has brought Moscow 
closer to the Iraniani camp. 

As the war continues, the possibility of a confrontation 
between the super-powers increases. This will be especially 

, true if a frustrated Iran carries out its threat to close the 
Straits of Hormuz or attacks Iraq's Arab supporters in the 
Persian Gulf. 

A virtually certain military response to such action by the 
United States would threaten an equally certain response 
from the Soviet Union. 

Of course, the current configuration of alignments is 
always subject to change and the tacit alliance between the 
US, Saudi Arabia and Iraq is not without contradictions.

carpenters, painters,

enough cash to maintain a 
pleasant and independent 
lifestyle. 

But the bulk of the 
underground economy is 
hardly this benign. Miguel 
Sanches (not his real name) 
dismantles derelict freigh· 
ters in a Richmond, 
California shipyard. The 
dust and fumes from cutting 
torches make breathing in 
the ship's hold almost 
impossible. Although Miguel 

has a work permit, most of 
the others at the shipyard are 
undocumented workers who 
fear deportation if they 
contact government agencies 
about job conditions. The pay 
is good - especially by 
Mexican standards - but 
Miguel plans to Quit this 
month. 

The San Francisco Bay 
Area, Los Angeles, Chicago 
and New York have all seen 
similar marginal businesses 
become a major part of the 
underground economy. New 
York's Chinatown has an 
estimated 500 sweatshops 

alone, with another 500 in the 
South Bronx. Many Asian 
immigrants work in garment 
factories and restaurants, 
but cash·only companies 
commonly include hotels 
bakeries, car washes, dry 
cleaners, janitorial compan· 
ies, foundries and food 
processing plants. 

Not all the activity in the 
cash economy can be 
attributed simply to avarice 
inflation and high taxes, '

Linguist Chomsky 
to lecture at SDSU 

The man considered by 
many to be the world's most 
influential linguist will 
appear at San Diego State 
Univ.ersity next Monday as 
the fIrst of the Distinguished 
Graduate Research Lecture 
Series. 

Noam Chomsky, professor 
of linguistics at Massachu· 
setts Institute of Technology, 
is known for his revolution· 
ary theories of language 

. which have affected not only 
linguistics, but anthropol· 
ogy psychology, computer 
SCtence and ethology (the 
study of animal behavior). 

Chomsky' will speak at 4 
pm on the Mainstage of 
SDSU's Dramatic Arts 
Building. The public is 
invited to attend this open 
lecture. The public will be 
permitted to park in 
university lots from 3;30 . 6 
pm. 

Beginning in the 1950's, 
Chomsky criticized the then 
current theories of language, 
offering a new theory. He 
contended that humans have 
an inherent capacity to 
acquire language and an 
innate ability to learn basic 

rules of grammar from the 
sentences they hear in early 
childhood. 

Chomsky's theory explains 
the human ability to 
understand and create an 
infinite number of original 
sentences. This theory thus 
answers questions previous 
theories had left unanswer· 
ed. 

His theories allow 
scientists to understand such 
research problems as how 
humans acquire language, 
how they speak more than 
one language, the differences 
between computer language 
and human language and the 
differences between human 
and animal (especially ape) 
communication. 

The Distinguished Grad· 
uate Research Lecture Series 
is designed to bring eminent 
scientists and scholars of 
national and international 
stature to campus to share 
the rewards and problems of 
research and gradllate 
education. 

The series is sponsored by 
the SDSU Graduate Division 
and Research and the SDSU 
Research Council. For more

Two promising new 
therapeutic approaches to 
cancer are under develop-
ment at the UCSD Medical 
Center. 0 n e . e m p loy s 
ordinary alcohol and the 
other extreme heat, both in 
combination with catheter 
angiography. . . 

The catheter, a hollow tube 
less than an eighth of an inch 
in diameter, is a key element 
in the apparent effectiveness 
of both the alcohol treatment 
and fiyperthermia therapy, 
according to Dr. Joseph J. 
Bookstein, chief of Vascular 
Radiology at the Medical 
Center. It delivers the alcohol 
directly to the cancer to 
destroy malignant cells 
without damaging healthy 
tissue around them. 

In hyperthermia, the 
catheter is employed to stop 
the flow of blood to the 
cancer, enabling temperature 
at the cancer site to be raised 
to a ,killing level of over 113 
dew:;ees F (45 degrees C). 

'Adequate heating of the 
cancer located within the 
deeper body organs has been 
a problem, but by stopping 
the flow of blood WIth a 
catheter clamp or plug, our 
radio frequency generator 
can raise the tem~rature 
without difficulty, Book· 
stein ex·plained. "Since the 
blood flow continues in the 
normal tissues, the tempera·

When heat therapy is 
combined with small doses of 
radiation in Dr. Bookstein's 
experimental rabbits, the 
cancers have been destroyed 
in 90 percent of the cases; he 
reported. Heat used alone has 
been successful in 40 percent 
of the cases. Untreated 
control rabbits died within 
five to six weeks . A 
doughnut·shaped ring about 
10 inches in diameter and 1 
inch thick is placed around 
the body at the cancer site 
and generates heat by radio 
frequenty. The planned 
UCSD Cancer Center facility 
will be equipped for 
hyperthermia therapy, 
Bookstein indicated. 

Alcohol treatment is one of 
several therapies exploiting 
catheter ability to deliver 
drugs directly into tumor 
blood supply in greater 
concentration than is 
possible with intravenous 
injection, Too toxic to inject 
into the general bloodstream, 
pure alcohol in high 
concentration can be 
delivered solely to the tumor 
site by catheter. The patient 
shows no more side effects 
than those engendered by a 
double Scot~h, Bookstein 
said. 

The Parking Office plans 
to publicize the change 
through The Daily Guardian 
and will install maps 
showing the new routes and 
different bus stops at key 
locatiMls on campus. 

Students, staff, faculty and 
others have strongly 
criticized the administra-
tion's failure to solicit input 
before initiating the change. 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage, 
. who learned of the proposed 
change through a story in 
The Daily Guardian last 
Friday, suggested the 
establishment of a student 
advisory committee to advise 
the administration on 
matters such as this. 

Ledden, however, said he 
has doubts about the 
effectiveness of such a 
committee. 

"Given the wide range of 
jssues to be dealt with by the 
administration, a single 
committee might not be the 
most effective resource for 
input on decisions," he said. 

"I prefer that everyone 
stay alert and consult the 
appropriate group as each 
issue comes up, rather than 
deal each time with a blanket 
group," he said .
