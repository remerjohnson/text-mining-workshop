Students 
Won't Back 
New Fees 

BY JEFF 
BERESFORD-HOWE 

News Editor 
Students sent a strong 

message against higher fees in 
yesterday's AS election, 
approving only one fee 
increase and expressing 
serious concern over the 
possible effects of Proposition 
9_ 

The Recreation Center, up 
for the second time in two 
years, got 72 percent of the 
vote and the required 25 
percent turnout, so construc-
tion will begin sometime at a 
cost to each student of $6.50 
per quarter. 

However, voters refused to 
add $2.50 a quarter to their 
activity fees, overwhelmingly 
rejecting a proposal put forth 
by Activity Fee chairman BiU 
Topkis, who Willi ahead last 
night in his race for V.P. 

The strongest student 
sentiment, though, was 
against Howard Jarvis' tax-
cutting Proposition 9, which 
would, UC President David 
Saxon says, force tuition for 
the first time in UC's 112 year 
history.

Very Silly Slate 
Ahead in Two Races 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Writer 

The large field jumbled AS 
election results released last 
night leaving six run-offs and 
prolonging the campaigns of 
12 candidates until the April 
30 run-off election. 

In the presidential race, 
unda Sabo of the "Student 
Interelih, Not Special 
Interests" slate collected 28% 
of the vote and wiD face "Very 
Silly Student" slate leader 
Jeremy Charlton who received 
18%, in the run-off. 

Sabo's running mate, BiD 
T opkis, edged out "College 
Priority" candidate Jan 
Breslauer in the vice -
presidential by only two votes, 
creating a second major run-
off. 

Three other "silly" 
candidates joined Charlton in 
his victory over "serious" 
competitonl. Cindy Biondi 
swept the race for Communi-
cations officer, collecting 67% 
of the vote and leading her 
competitor, Paul Jurczak, by 
560 votes. 

Meg Honda and Randy 
Thompson will represent the 
slate in public relations and 

activity fee run-offs, 
respectively. 

The "Progressive Coali-
tion" alate did not fare as well, 
as only one slate member, Lee 
Anderson, captured a poIition 
on the Council, EIectiona 
Officer. 

Presidential candidate 
Barry Hyman, who firUhed 
fifth in the race with 10Cfb, said 
.last njght that he and the entire 
"Proireaaive Coalition" would 
"continue to preas, inIide and 
outside the AS, for action that 
addresses the needs we have 
raised." 

Jon Bekken, AS Student 
Welfare Commissioner this 
year, "Progressive Coalition" 
member, and third place 
finisher in the Activity Fee 
category, declined to 
comment and supported 
Hyman' statement. 

The "Constructive Action" 
slate, led by Student 
Affirmative Action chairman 
Robert Cunningham-T ambu-
zi, who finished third hehind

presidential race, fared little

Reg Fee Paid Abortions Do Not 
Violate Constitution, Judge Says 
BY DOROTHY HOUSTON 

Senior Staff Writer 
A San Diego Superior 

Court judge ruled yesterday 
that UC funding of student 
abortions with registration fee' 
monies does not infringe on the 
First Amendment rights of 
students wh"o oppose 
abortions . 

A group of UC students 
from six campuses, including 
UCSD, have entered into a 
suit against the University of 
California claiming that 

through payment of registra-
tion fees they are compelled to 
support abortions, an action 
which they say violates the 
free exercise of their basic 
religious beliefs. 

Other claims in the suit, 
involving additional aspects of 
the registration fee and 
involving student medical 
insurance, were not decided 
upon so the two and a half year 
old case has yet to be 
completed. 

Attorneys for the plaintiffs 

said they will appeal 
yesterday's judgement. 

In the summary judgement, 
Judge Franklin Orfield said 
that in order to show 
infringement of the free 
exercise of religion, one must 
"demonstrate he has been 
coerced or that government 
has interfered. I see no 
coercion. The students are not 
required to submit to abortion 
or to advocate abortion or 
birth control counseling."

Mountjoy's Riot Bill Rejected 
By Democratic Assembly, 32-19 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
s.cramento Correspondent 

In a last ditch move to 
resurrect a bill that would 
expel California's college 
students convicted of rioting or 
assaulting a police officer, 
assemblyman Dick Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) yesterday ac-
cused the Democratic domi-
nated allSembly of trying to 
keep con trover . ial is ues off 
the floor . 

'~AS 2031 is a good 
example of the kind of issues 

people here would like to 
duck ," said Mountjoy. 

The Assembly voted 32-
1 ~ agaInst reconsidering 
Mountjoy's Bill overriding 
decisions by the Post 
Secondary Education 
Subcommittee and the 
Education Committee to kill it. 

Amid heated debate over 
the unconstitutionality of the 
bill, assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) 
pointed out that because no 
student from a post-secondary 

institution has been convicted 
of rioting in the last three 
years, the bill does not even 
deal with a critical problem. 

Mounijoy told the assembly 
that his bill was aimed 
particularly at Iranian 
students .... who would have lost

Privacy Threatel)ed by Intelligence Act 
BY NAT HENTOFF 

Among the abuses 01 power which launched the American Re volu· tion 200 years ago, none rankled 
coIonista more than the habitual rape 01 
their privacy by British revenue 
oHicerl. Armed with unspecilic general 
search warrants, goverrvnent agents 
appeared in the dead 01 night, turning 
citizens' homes inside-out in an effort to 
find evidence 01 criminal activity .

liberties . 
But in its zeal to "unleash" the CIA 

and other intelligence agencies , the 
Carter Administration is now pushing 
for legal changes which m a y 
signilicantly dilute what is left of the 
citizens' right to privacy. 

Legislation currently before 
Congress, the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) claims , wou ld 
authorize the intelligence community 
to secure a court order "permitting 
agents to surreptiously open the mail or 
break into the homes of American 
citizemi in the middle of the night to 
steal their papers. The warrants would

and apeciaI '-WI have helped meet that Fourth Amendment pa'l'licularly 
technological challenge to civil intriguing il that, if the legislation 

passes , agents will have to go to a 
special court lor these secret warrants. 
And , although most citizens don' t 
know it , this Kalka·like tribunal 
already exists and is lunctioning in a 
more restricted area 01 privacy-
Invasion. 

Authorized by th e Foreign 
Intelligence Survei lla nce Act of 1978, 
the court consists of seven Federal 
District judges and three Court of 
Appeals judges . All appointments to 
the court are made by Chiel Justice 
Warren Burger , whose particular 
passion has been to gut the Fourth 
Amendment because it gets in the way 
01 law-enforcement officials . 

Called the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court, this new body -
which sees only government agents 
and government lawyers - currently 
has jurildiction only over goverrvnent 
applications for electronic surveillance 
Irom inside loreign embassies here; 
others are directed at suspect US 
citizens. 

The Washington Post reported in a small item on March 4 that during its first nine months of 
work, the &ecl'et court "has granted 
every government request to use 
wiretapa, bugs, and other electronic 
lurveiUance in foreign intelligence 

" cases. 

Among tl-le way'S in which this eerie 
tribunal differs irom all others is tha t no 
notice need ever be given to someone 
being elec tronically tracked- unless 
he is brought to prosecution_ By 
contrast, under Title III 01 the 
Omnibus Crime Control and Sale 
Streets Act (1968), the targets of all 
other wir e taps and e lec tron ic 
surveiUance- lrom the Mafia to sticky-
fin gered Congressmen-must be 
inlormed, sooner or later, that the 
government has been watching and 
listening to them, even if there is never 
any prosecution. 

Under the secret court, however, 
any number of us may become the 
pawn of mysterious, impenetrable 
forces_ 

One of the reasons the secret court is 
unknown to much of the populace is 
that the ACLU, which ordinarily might 
have blown the whistle on such 
ominous goverrvnent encroachments 
on privacy, agreed to its creation. 

It was one 01 those times , alas, when 
the ACLU deCided to be "pragmatic ." 
It made a deal. In retum lor certain 
presumed safeguards in the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 
the ACLU decided to lay low rather 
than mount opposition to the bill setting 
up the court.

not studied the fac ts ." 
Let's examine the falsities 

in the letter by Schulze. 
S c hulze claimed the 
maximum dollar tax 
reduction lor someone in the 
$10,000 tax bracket was 
$12 per month. This is 
incorrect; the number in 
reality is doser to 520 per 
month. Schulze claimed that 
"if you gross $30,000 or 
more , you get back $120 or 
$200 per month back ." This 
would mean at a minimum 
they would receive an annual 
reduction 01 $1440_ Simply 
look at the tax table of the 
Calilomia State Income Tax 
Booklet. You will lind the 
maximum reduction for 
anyone in the $30,000 tax 
bracket with a 53.6 percent 
reduction could not possibly 
receive even the minimum 
amount that was quoted. In 
fac t, for an annual household 
income of $30,000 , the 
monthly savings would be 
$66.33. And for a "~ross" of 
$30,000, the amount could 
be even less. 

Mr . Schulze s aid 
" Percentages reflect any way 
we like them to." He then 
proceeded to use them ' tile 
way he "liked them to" by 
saying that 55 percent of the 
savings goes to 3 j)el'ceht of 
the people. This is 

, misleading. According to 
Governor Brown, an 
opponent of Prop. 9, 10 
percent 01 the taxpayers wiD 
receive this portion 01 the 
savings. But since those top 
10 percent get the lowest 
percentage tax break, this 
would also mean that they , 
are paying well over half the 
taxes . And Prop. 9 would do 
nothing but increase the 
percentage of the taxes they 
would be paying. 

Schulze said, " Let's talk 
dollars instead 01 percen-

t~es." Ok, let's do 10, only 
let • presenttM whole picture 
and not just part 01 it, as he 
presented. A houlehold with 
an annual income of 
$50,000 would be paying 
$1850.55 in state income 
tax; this il 49 .4 percent less 

or $1807.45 less than they 
would now pay. A household 
"lth an annual income of 
S15,000 would end up 
paying taxes of only 
$11 7.33, a reduction of 
70.1 percent, or 5275.07. 
This would mean that a 
household earning Ie" than 
four timel as much income 
ends up paying over 15 times 
as much in taxes. Now, isthili 
an unfair tax break for the 
rich? The source 01 the

Hostage' Rescue Fails 
As Eight Fliers Killed 

WASHINGTON - The 
White House announced early 
this morning that a daring 
military effort to rescue 
American hostages held in 
Tehran was aborted because 
of "equipment failure ." A 
collision of two US aircraft on 
the ground in an Iranian desert 
resulted in the deaths of eight 
crewmen, the announcement 
said. 

A statement read to 
reporters by White House 
press Secretary Jady Powell 
said all Americans involved in 
the operation, including an 
unspecified number of injured, 
had been taken out 01 Iran. 

Powell said the injured 
persons are expected to 
recover. 

Presiden t Carter , who 
ordered termination of the 
million, " accepts lull 
responsibility for the decision 
to atteme! the rescue," Powell 
said. "The United States 
continues to hold the 
government of Iran respon-
sible for the safety 01 the 
American hostages . The 
United States remains 
determined to obtain their safe 
release at the earliest possible 
time." 

T he Carter spokesman 
said, " I a m not in a position to 
provide additional information 
at this time." He said he 
expected further announce-
ments about four am Pacihc 
Time. 

The White House state-
ment began: 

" The president ordered the 
cancellation of an operation in 
Iran which was under way to 
prepare lor a rescue 01 our 
hostages . The mission was 
terminated because of 
equipment lailure. 

" During the subliequent 
withdrawal 01 American 
personnel , there was a 
collision between our aircraft 
on the ground at a remote. 
desert location in Iran. There 
were no military hostilities, but 
the president deeply regrets 
that eight American crew 
members 01 the two aircraft 
were killed and otherll were 
injured in the accident." 

" Americans involved in the 
operation have now been 
airlifted from Iran and those 
who were injured are being 
given medical treatment and 
are expected to recover."

Anderson: I'm 
Independent 

WASHINGTON - Re-
publican John B. Anderson 
became an independent 
candidate lor president 
yesterday, appealing for the 
support of voters 110 
disenchanted by the prospect 
of a Carter-Reagan choice this 
Iallthat they might stay home 
on Election Day. 

In Au s tin , Texas, 
Republican Iront-runner 
Ronald Reagan said there was 
"a terrible possibility" that 
Anderson'. reborn candidacy 
might throw the November 
election into the House 01 
Representatives. 

Reagan said he was not 
seriously concerned it might 
happen, but if it did-with 
Democrats holding the 
majority in the House-"it's 
pretty obvious what would 
happen." 

White House press 
secretary Jady Powell said it 
was too early to predict the 
impact of an independent 
Anderson candidacy on 
President Carter's bid lor re-
election. Neither would he say 

whether the Carter campaign 
would go to court in an attempt 
to keep Anderson's name 011 
the November ballots. 

Abandoning his to-month-
long quest for the Republican 
presidential nomination at a 
news conlerence at the 
National Pres s Club, 
Anderson said: 

"There is current statistical 
evidence that virtually one-
half of potential voters are 
dissatisfied with a choice 
between President Carter and 
Ronald Reallan." 

Anderson repeatedly 
disputed contentions that an 

ind~ndent candidacy will 
make him a spoiler who could 
not win, but · might give the 
election to one of the two 
malor party nominees.

UCSD's Brian Harton gave a 
golid performance, finishing 
the test of endurance at 10:02, 
good enough for a place 
among the top competitors. 

In the sprints, Steve Kasa 
was UCSD's top performer 
with times of 11: 15 in the 100 
m and 23:5 in the 200 m . 
Seeman also added an 11.82 
to his winning triple jump. 

The UCSD's women's track 
team has been forced to 
compete with only four 
athletes. But they have still 
competed well in a number of 
events. 

Sherre Lilley placed in the 
top three in three different 
events with throws of 110' in 
discUl, 29' shotput, and a 
108' in javelin. 

The meet ended with the 
men's 400 m, which turned 
out to be the most exciting 
event for the Tritons a5 Steve 
Kasa gave a come·from·

Novices Battle For Practice 
Women's Waterpolo Getting Started at Several Schools 

BY SAMANTHA ROBY 
Staff Writ« 

The Women's Waterpolo 
Club is hosting a developmen. 
taltoumament alated for today 
and tomorrow at the 
natatorium. 

A developmental tourna· 
ment is one to which newer, 
less experienced teams are 
invited. They can compete 
with other teams of the same 
caliber without the frustration 
of having to fight losing battles 
with more experienced team •. 

F.ight teams are scheduled 
to participate. They are 
UCSD, Pomona.Pitzer, USC, 
Redlands, San Diego State, 
Commerce AAU (the only 
AAU learn competing), and 
two of UC Santa Barbara's 
three teams. 

In preparation for the event, 
letters were sent to the coaches 
of waterpoio teams at the 
developmental stage. The first 
seven clubs to respond were 

signed up. 
The idea behind this 

tournament is to enable these 
developing teams to get in a lot 
of playing time against teams 
of their own level - a 
necessary factor in the 
construction of a new team. 
The toumament structure is 
round·robin, with two bracketa 
of four teams. The goal of 
maximum playing time was 
attained through this 
structure. Every team is 
guaranteed three games; two 
teams get four games; four 
teams are insured of five 
games. 

UCSD has faced five of the 
seven visiting teams 
previously . UCSB and 
Redlands both artici ted in 
the recent UC ~nta &:bara 
tournament. In that outint, 
UCSD lQuared off with Santa 
Barbara's A team (their A and 
B wiU be at this tournament) 
and was defeated 17·3. The 

Tritons sank Redlands 14·2 
behind a solid offensive game. 
Santa Barbara A went on to 
win the championship 10·2 
over San Diego State. 

UCSD had met San Diego 
State once before when they 
were taken for an 8·3 loss. 
Nevertheless, they put out a 
good all-around effort against 
the Aztec 's stronger team. 
USC is another club familiar to 
UCSD. The Tritons dropped 
their season opener to the 
Trojans, 12·6. 

In another contest , they 
routed Pomona· Pitzer 9·6. 
The Tritons were behind 5 ·3 
going into the fourth period, 
but rallied for six goals and 
allowed only one. It was the 
second time this season 
UCSD'. Claudia O'Brian put 
in seven goals in a I(ame. 

UCSD'. scheduled games 
are at 10 am Friday VI. USC, 
3:00 pm Friday VI. Santa 
Barbara.

Failed DreaDls Live in 'Mice and Men' 
John Steinbeck is reknown· 

ed for his compassion and 
social concern, and Of Mice 
and Men is no exception . 

First appearing in 1937 as a 
novelette, the work is 
described by Steinbeck as a

Quickly and smoothly 
transferred to the stage where 
it won much acclaim.

outstanding production of 
this work through May

Steinbeck' took the title of 
his work from a line in a Robert 
Bums poem:

dream around which their lives 
revolve. Yet despite ca reful 
planning and calculating, the 
dream remains unattainable. 

inadvertently causing trouble 
because he has no concept of 
his own strength. 

Of Mice and Men is a tightly 
structured play with the tragic 
events unfolding in three short 
days. The play contains some 
of Steinbeck's finest, most 
compassionate writing. His 
characters and dialogue are 
thoroughly believeable yet 
take on a striking poetic 
quality.

The play also explores the

The Rep production merits 
high praise for ita excellent 
cast. George and Lennie are 
extremely difficult roles but 
Ian Arrow and Bm Dunnam 
look physically right for the

performances. 

As George, Arrow's acting 
is low.keyed and effective. 
When George explains why he

But the Triton eillht found 
themselves on the short end,

"We were ahead for the-first 
1000 meters," explained 
coxswain Jullian Halliday. 
"However, we weren't running 
smoothly and they powered 
through UII." 

The Daily Guardian Friday, April 25, 1980 

With the &eallon four weeks 
underway, the 53 members of 
the men's and women', squads 
have managed to overcome 
some seerninsrly solutionless 
problems and fare well in 
leveral competitions despite

The lightweights are using a

workouts, " Halliday said. 
"This type of training, plus 
some seat changes , will make

Cycle Hopes Crash at .Hairp~n 
UCSD Takes 3rd of 5 Despite Early Strength 

BY TIM LlOlT.A 
5pom Editer 

Despite some untimely aaahes and some 
tough racing luck, the UCSD cycling team 
pcked themselvei up and placed third in UC 
Santa Cruz CriteRlm, held lut weekend. 

The toughest opponent the cyclilts teemed 
to face WIU the hiUy 1.3 km courle with a 
hairpin tum which claimed a number of 
cyclisla. In spite of their difficulties, the Tritons 
outfinished two tough school. in Stanford and 
UC Santa Cruz. UC Santa Barbara won the 
Criterium followed by Foothill College. 

The expert race, a 40-lap marathon gave 
the Triton. the mOlt difficulties. George 
Grigoriev was the fir.t victim of the tight tum 
as he crashed on lap nine. Grigoriev was badly 
scraped in the fall but was not seriously 
injured. 

Paul Vine kept up the U€SD hopes until he 
fell off the pace with seven laps to go. Kurt 
Sato took a tumble in the second to last lap. 

The race was won by Andy Hampsten 
from the University of North Dakota. Mark 
Brandt, from Foothill , was second. 

The Criterium's novice race, a 20-lap 
contest, provided the Tritons with some 
impressive showings. Mark Gerber placed 
fifth and Tim Rodden finished ninth, despite 
falling in the last lap. 

The race was very competitive in the early 
going as UCSD and UC Santa Barbara 
~rinted out to force the early pace. The 
Tritons looked very aggressive as they 
attacked the course, forcing the iaaue. 

But, again, the course prevailed as the hills 
dragged the usually consistent David Held 
and Greg Sherman off the pace midway 
through. 

As the race progressed, a group of 10 riders 
sprinted away from the rest of the field. 
UCSD's Gerber and Rodden fought it out with 
the other eight riders for command. 

Rodden gave UCSD the most to cheer 
about as he placed an impressive fifth . Gerber 
couldn't handle the hairpin on the last lap and 
fell into a protective hay bale, but he picked 
himself up and still managed to capture ninth 

UCSD and USC novice boats 
by sizeable margins . 

The UCSD Novice Eight's 
loss followed its first victory 
since the men began rowing 
together, on April 12 against 
Long Beach in Newport. 

" As a whole, the novice 
boat is not real powerful," 
commented Coach Jack 
Vallerga. "But, we've got a 
good collection of people with 
potential and with the 
poaaibility of makin$t the first 
boats by next year." 

The men's Heavyweight 
Eight had their troubles 
holding back a persistent USC 
boat and wound up in third 
place at San Pedro. USD won 
the race in a time of 6: 11.3 
(2000 meters), pursued 
closely by USC with 6: 11.6. 

"The heavyweightli have 
been working out and seat 
racing in fours this week in 
preparation for upcoming 
regattas," Vallerga said. For 
the remaining races, against 
Loyola Marymount and the 
Western Sprints , the 
hea vyweights will only 
compete in fours. 

As far as the women's 
squad is concerned, Coach 
Shirley Doell is looking for 
good things, especially from 
her Lightweight Eight (130 
pounds and under with boat 
weight not to exceed 1000 
pounds). Currently 3-0 in 
competition , the eight, stroked

1000 meter course. USC's 
women won the race. 

The biggest triumph for the 
women this season has been 
the Lightweight Eight's victory

finish, edging out the UC

Ten women travel to San

boats, a Lightweight Eight,

Saturday and Sunday. 

"At this regalia we will meet

Lightweight Eight should be 
able to do extremely well ," the 
coach predicted.

Tidelands Oil Money Goes . to Edu~ation 
Universities, Public Schools Get Building Funds, Energy Gains Too -. Given Prop: 9 Fdils 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
s.c •• menlo Correopondenl 

The State Senate yesterday 
approved a bill that would 
guarantee the state's public 
universities $150 million 
annually for building 
construction and main -
tainence and aeate an Energy 
and ReSouries Fund from the 
tidelands oil revenues. 

The bill, which would also 
allot $250 malion to public 
schools (kindergarten through 
12th grade) for building 
upkeep, would be automatical-
ly invalidated if Prop 9 pasSei. 

Sponsored by Senator 

Albert l<odda (D-Sacramen-
to), endorsed by Governor 
Brown, UC and the state and 
community colleges, the bill is 
designed to end &peculation 
about the use of the state's 
tidelands oil windfall profits. 

Since the mid·SO's this 
revenue has been earmarked 
for the Capital Outlay Fund for 
Public Higher Education 
(COFPHE). But with the 
congressional deregulation 01 
the price of oil and increased 
production, estimated profits 
suddenly soared over $20 
billion for the next decade. 

Senator Alfred Alquist (0-

San Jo s e) added an 
amendment to the Rodda bill 
which would direct the entire 
tidelands oil revenUei into the 
state's general fund should 
Prop 9 pass on June 3 . 

Several legislators 
expressed concern that this 
would abolish the COFPHE 
fund all together. 

Some observers suggest 
that this amendment may be 
changed when the bill goes to 
the assembly since it was 
aimed at controlling the 
Governor's Energy and 
ResourCei Fund rather than 
hurt public education. 

Under Rodda's bill, the new 
COFPHE fund of $150 
million will be divided equally 
between the university, the 
state and the community 
colleges. . 

Each project funded by 
COFPHE must be approved 
by the legislature. 

Some of the university's 
capital outlay projecla for 
1980-81 have already been 
approved ,by the Assembly 
Ways and Means Subcommit-
tee. $17 million will go for the 
UCSD Medical Center, $9 
million for equipment 
replacement, $8 million for 

library compact shelving, $5 
million for making facilities 
seisrnicly safe, and for adding 
facilities for the handicapped. 

The Asaembly Way. and 
Means Subcommittee aIao 
approved over half a milion 
dollars of UC budget 
propoaala to be funded from 
the enerlO' and resources lund.-

r The UC budget items to be 
financed from this are the new 
research unit called the Energy 
In.titute ($150,000), 
appropriate technology 
($168,000) and utiliti~. 
conservation project. 
($250,000).

Speaker Leo McCarthy (D-
San Francisco) criticized 
Mountjoy's motives , which he 
said were to have every 
Assembly member's vote on 
record in campaign literature 
this fall. He further predicted 
these votes would be used 
against legislators during the 
fall re-election campaigns. 

" I think we are all very 
sensitive of the American 
people's sense of outrage over 
what is happening to our fellow 
citizens in Tehran, that we are 
very angry about it and that 
we are trying to do something 
to get them released," said 
McCarthv,

The payment of the fees, 

Orfield said, does "not mean 
the endorsement of abortion. " 

Three UCSD students, 
Susan Erzinger , Margaret 
Patton and Albin Rhomberg, 
originally initiated the suit 
against the University, which , 
in addition to charging 
violation of First Amendment 
rights, questions the use and 
imposition of the registration 
fees. 

The suit also holds that 
students should not be forced 
into accepting campu s 
insurance programs that fund 
student abortions.

not been ruled on yet , so the

continue at least through the 
June trial date. 

There is no University 
provided insurance at UCSD, 
but some other UC schools 
provide insurance to their 
students. 

Fifty-six students have 
joined the original three UCSD 
plaintiffs and 26 more are 
trying to join the group. All the 
students involved are not 
paying the full registration fee . 
The 59 plaintiffs , who have 
paid into a registration fee trust 
account , are presently 
protected by a restraining 
order from expulsion from the 
University. 

Those attemptin g to 
become plaintiffs are not 
protected by the order. 

Students are attending 
class, but even though they are 
not enrolled some are gaining 
written grades from their 
professors. 

After the judgement was 
announced, Rhomberg, a 
UCSD doctoral student, said, 
"If a condition to finishing my 
PhD is to pay for abortion, I 
will never pay." 

"I'm no more willing to pay 
for killing unborn children than 
for the holocaust In 
Germany ," he said. The 
judge, Rhomberg said, "has 
given the University the right 
to exclude people from their 
education." 

In his argument , attorney 

for the plaintiff. Burton 
S~y smd the UniverUty 
" make. them (.tudent.) 
comply with what they think i. 
right. It refused to honor F'nt 
Amendment rights." 

The attorney called for the 
university to accommodate 
students opposed to abortion 
on religious and moral 
grounds through some IOrt of 
administrative adjustment fee 
payment procedure . He 
suggested a student be allowed 
to submit a card to the cashier 
allowing them to specifically 
exclude fees being used to 
support abortion funding. He 
cited the CalPIRG fee 
exemption process as an 
example.

TO THREE TOUGH QUESTIONS. 
1. 

Is DIGITAL a well-managed company? 

Friday, April 25, 1980 

Progressive management is a Digital trademark. In fact, in the December 
1979 issue of Dun's Review, we were cited as one of the five best-managed 

companies in America. 

2-
Is DIGITAL competitive in the marketplace 

and what are the company's long-range prospects? 
Digital is the world leader in the fastest-growing segment of the computer 
industry: minicomputers. Today, our products are used in just about every 
industry you can name. Our potential as a company is virtually unlimited. 

3.
