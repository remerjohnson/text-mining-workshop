Baudoin, on the other hand, said

Although the San Diego Superior 
Court recently ruled that UCSD did 
not steal business from sports camps 
run by a former men’s basketball head 
coach, certain legal questions regarding 
the camps’ ownership remain unre-
solved.    

The suit, filed in 2005 by former  
coach Greg Lanthier, accused four cam-
pus administrators of stealing business 
from GJL Sports Camps, on-campus 
programs once managed by Lanthier 
that registered more than $60,000 in 
profits. 

The lawsuit alleged that former Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson, Director of Athletics Earl 
W. Edwards, Director of Student 
Affairs and Sports Facilities Donald E. 
Chadwick and Bill Carr, who succeed-
ed Lanthier as men’s basketball coach, 
continued to receive profits from the 
camps after Lanthier’s contract was not 
renewed in 2005. Specifically, Lanthier 
said that UCSD deliberately interfered 
with a prospective economic advantage 
and “palmed off” the camps, defined 
as the intentionally deceptive sale of 
a substitute product in place of the 
original.

Associate Vice Chancellor of 
University Communications Stacie A. 
Spector said that Lanthier’s contract 
was not renewed due to performance 
issues and negative player evaluations. 
However, at least six players quit the 
basketball team following Lanthier’s 
termination.  

A focal issue of the legal proceed-
ing was whether GJL Sports Camps, 
established in 1994 and operated using 
UCSD’s sports facilities, was a cam-
pus entity or a private business inde-
pendently owned and managed by 
Lanthier.

“After Lanthier’s time at UCSD 
was over, the same opportunity to run 
sports camps was offered to the new 
head men’s basketball coach,” Spector 
said. “Lanthier believed this amounted 
to ‘taking’ his business, even though the 
basketball camp was a UCSD entity.”  

However, Lanthier disputed the 
camps’ ownership, saying not only that 
they were his own private business, but 
that then-Associate Campus Counsel 
Daniel W. Park admitted so in a signed 
letter dated March 24, 2005.  

“The Athletics Department has 
confirmed that UCSD does not spon-
sor or operate sports camps,” Park said 
in the letter obtained by the Guardian. 
“Rather, all sports camps operated out 
of UCSD’s facilities are owned and 
operated by private individuals.”

Lanthier said he maintained sole 
responsibility of running the business 
and was not offered any special benefits

the state would lose $71 million next 
year, while the impact in subsequent 
years is unknown.

Since the proposition does not 
offer new sources of income, spend-
ing an estimated $300 million on 
the community college system 
would require an increase in fees 
or reduction of available programs 
and services. Although one-third of 
UC undergraduate students trans-
ferred from community colleges, the 
regents defended their decision to 
oppose the initiative, arguing that 
the board could not aid one sector 
of higher education at the expense 
of another.

The decision has drawn signifi-

UC Board Opposes Community College Funding Measure
By Marianne Gray
Contributing Writer

The UC Board of Regents voted 
Nov. 15 to oppose Proposition 92 
in February 2008’s upcoming bal-
lot, an initiative that would benefit 
California community colleges by 
increasing funding by approximate-
ly $300 million. 

Also known as the Community 
College Governance, Funding 
Stabilization and Student Fee 
Reduction Act, Proposition 92 would 
reduce the college system’s fees by 
$5 and limit future fee increases to 
no more than the cost of living. It 
would also lock in funding for the 
state’s community colleges, regard-
less of fluctuations in their popula-

tion, and guarantee the community 
college system independence from 
state politics. But Californians for 
Improving Community Colleges, 
a coalition of educators and com-
munity college organizations, claims 
that these changes could be enforced 
without affecting K-12 funding or 
raising taxes.

Community colleges aim to prepare 
students for four-year colleges while 
teaching workplace and basic skills 
such as reading, writing and math-
ematics. These institutions account for 
70 percent of California’s public higher 
education enrollment, and educate 
more Latino and black students than 
the UC and CSU systems combined, 
according to a statewide poll conducted 
by Yes On Prop 92.

Despite acknowledging that the 
community college system’s educa-
tional mission is “vital to educating 
the people of California,” the regents 
expressed concern for the uninten-
tional effects of the proposition on 
“unprotected” state programs run by 
the UC and CSU systems. 

In a statement released by the 
UC Office of the President, the 
board said that the proposition 
would “lock up” a great amount 
of the California’s General Fund, 
the state’s primary funding source 
for general government services 
including business, transportation, 
housing and legislative operations, 
therefore restricting its spending 
priorities. California Secretary of 
State Debra Bowen estimated that

At peak traffic hours on Genesee 
Avenue, cars are stacked bumper to 
bumper, with red lights glaring and 
drivers’ tempers often reined in on a 
short leash.

These hassles typify the grow-
ing need for improved traffic flow in 
University City, and have led the San 
Diego City Council to make plans to 
extend Regents Road through Rose 
Canyon Park. An 870-foot bridge over 
the park would connect the north and 
south corridors of the city, adding an 
additional access point that safety offi-
cials say is desperately needed.

“Basically, the mayor’s primary rea-
son for recommending [the Regents 
Road bridge] was emergency access 
and fire response,” said Madeleine 
Baudoin, a policy analyst for City 
Councilman Scott Peters.

The only available access to 
University City is by way of Genesee, 
and several reports indicate that the 
Regents Road bridge would greatly 
speed up emergency response times 
to the area, Baudoin said. Plans for 
the roadway have been developing for 
over a decade, plagued by false starts 
and numerous protests over possible 
damages to Rose Canyon Park.

“The community really is split on 
it,” Baudoin said. “It was a tough deci-
sion.”

Last year the city council studied 
seven different traffic routes, ultimate-
ly choosing the Regents Road bridge 
as the preferred alternative.

 However, some community groups 
see the bridge as detrimental to Rose 
Canyon Park, a site where many chil-
dren and adults enjoy morning runs 
and school field trips. According to 
Debbie Knight, president of the group 

Regents Expansion Piques Environmental Concerns

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN
Regents Road may be extended through Rose Canyon Park to improve access for emergency personnel, though the proposal is highly contentious among environmental groups.

Friends of Rose Canyon, the new road 
and subsequent bridge would be built 
directly through the park, disrupting 
many facets of the natural environ-
ment.

“How attractive is it to have 
a nature walk next to a high-speed 
road?” she said.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the California Department of 
Fish and Game have both expressed 
concerns that the road will disturb 
the area’s biological resources. Knight 
said that the canyon park is the area’s 
only green belt, which connects to 
Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. 
The Regional Water Quality Board 
has told the city that traffic pollutants 
may also endanger the nearby water 
quality, because runoff from the park 
flows into Mission Bay.

The city’s initial approval of the 
project led FRC and other concerned 
community groups to sue the city last 
September. The San Diego Superior 
Court ruled on Nov. 12 that the city 
must pay the groups’ legal fees, a deci-
sion that Knight called a “general vin-
dication” of her organization’s effort.

The groups’ main problem with 
the report was the misestimation of 

the bridge’s effect on the environment, 
according to Knight.

“Their environmental impact 
report was seriously, seriously flawed,” 
she said.

As a result of the lawsuit, the city 
decided to develop a new environ-
mental impact report. Knight said she 
hopes the report will lead the city to 
abandon its plans. 

In September, the city council 
entered into a contract with Project 
Design Consultants, the company ini-
tially hired to conduct the preliminary 
analysis of the seven different traffic 
alternatives. The city council allotted 
the company roughly $5 million for 
work on the Regents Road bridge, in 
addition to the $3 million spent for its 
preliminary analysis.

However, environmentalists have 
met the duality of the company’s tasks 
— both creating a final design and an 
environmental impact report at the 
same time — with scrutiny.

The California Environmental 
Quality Act requires an approved envi-
ronmental impact report before design 
and construction plans are finalized, 
while Caltrans prohibits agencies from 
creating a design before they have See REGENTS, page 6

Davis Professor Makes 
Thanksgiving a Science

People who record their rea-
sons to be thankful in a daily journal 
exercise more regularly, complain of 
fewer illness symptoms and feel bet-
ter overall about their overall lives, 
according to research conducted 
by UC Davis psychology professor 
Robert Emmons.

Taking time to count blessings 
instead of daily problems can also 
make a person feel more loving, for-
giving, joyful, enthusiastic and opti-
mistic about the future. In addition, 
family and friends of participants in 
the study reported that they seem 
happier and are more pleasant to be 
around.

“Gratitude is literally one of the 
few things that can measurably 
change people’s lives,” Emmons said 
in a press release. “Far from being a 
warm, fuzzy sentiment, gratitude is 
morally and intellectually demanding. 
It requires contemplation, reflection 
and discipline. It can be hard and 
painful work.”

Emmons is the author of three 
books about gratitude. His most 
recent book, published earlier this 
year, outlines 10 research-based 
strategies for cultivating a feeling of 
appreciation throughout the year, not 
just on Thanksgiving Day.

UC Receives $22M Grant 
for Health Care Network

In an effort to improve rural health 
care, the University of California was 
given a three-year, $22-million Federal 
Communications Commission grant 
to establish a statewide broadband 
telehealth network, university officials 

announced last week. 
The UC Office of the President 

and the UC Davis Health System 
will jointly manage the project, which 
aims to create a telecommunications 
system enabling rural communities 
to access a broad range of services 
that seek to improve the quality of 
care.

The California Telehealth Network 
is expected to connect more than 
300 rural sites, a network of special-
ists at academic medical centers and 
other providers in the state. The new 
network will also serve as a resource 
for emergency services and disaster 
preparedness. 

Moderate Pot Use Relieves 
Pain, More Worsens It
A UCSD study suggests that 

smoking moderate doses of 
marijuana helps to alleviate pain. 
However, researchers also found 
that smoking large amounts might 
increase pain.  

Researchers employed a group 
of 15 healthy people to smoke low, 
moderate and high doses of mari-
juana. Capsaicin, the spicy chemical 
found in chili peppers, was then 
injected into the participants to 
induce pain.

Pain was significantly reduced 45 
minutes after smoking a moderate 
dose, while subjects who smoked 
a larger dose during the same time 
frame reported feeling more pain.

“This is the first study using differ-
ent doses of cannabis and a tightly 
controlled pain stimulus that sug-
gests that cannabis has a therapeu-
tic window of pain relief,” researcher 
Mark S. Wallace, director of the 
Center for Clinical Pain Research, 
said in a press release.

cant criticism from the proposi-
tion’s supporters, who argue that 
improving community colleges is 
vital to opening up education for all 
Californians.

John McDowell, political director 
of the Los Angeles College Faculty 
Guild, said that the regents were 
“flat wrong” to oppose the item.

“California needs to educate 
more people for the future,” he 
said. “Proposition 92 would keep 
the promise made in 1960 in the 
California Master Plan to allow all 
Californians to go to college.”

Jennifer Wonnacott, official 
spokeswoman for Yes on Proposition 
92, was also disappointed with 
the decision, which she said was 
“wrong-headed.”  

“The proposition is about one 
thing: giving millions of students 
the opportunity to study,” she said. 
“It is unfortunate [the regents] could 
not see the benefits.” 

Supporters of Proposition 92 
include United Teachers Los Angeles, 
California Labor Federation, 
California State Council of Laborers, 
California Federation of Teachers, 
the Community College League of 
California, the Faculty Association 
of California Community Colleges, 
the California School Employees 
Association and the Los Angeles 
College Faculty Guild. Wonnacott 
said the regents’ objection to the 
measure will not stop its proponents 
from continuing to advocate on its 
behalf.

“We’ll continue moving for-
ward,” she said. “Voters will see the 
benefit.”

Baudoin emphasized that while the company 
may be working on both projects simultaneously, 
no construction will take place until the finalized 
report is finished and approved.

The office of San Diego City Attorney Michael 
Aguirre has repeatedly told the city council that 
it is in violation of California government codes 
1090 and 18700; both bylaws prohibit government 
officials and consultants from entering into con-
tracts and making governmental decisions when 
they could have a common financial interest. 

 “PDC had both participated in the shaping 
of its own resultant contract and influenced the 
governmental decision to design and build the 
Regents Road bridge, from which decision it 
stood to profit substantially through the expected 
follow-on contract,” Aguirre said in a memo to 
the city council. 

Earlier this year, Chief Deputy City Attorney 

Michael Calabrese also sent a memo stating that 
the contract made with PDC back in 2003 for 
the analysis of different traffic alternatives does 
not cover any further work on the Regents Road 
bridge.

Kevin Sullivan, an attorney hired by the city, 
said that he does not see a conflict of interest 
after extensively studying past contracts and 
meetings.

The finalized environmental impact report is 
not expected to be finished until October 2009.

Nonetheless, community residents and offi-
cials agree that conditions need to change to sup-
port the city’s traffic demands.

“We are doing the best we can to move for-
ward,” Baudoin said. “We are trying to do our 
best for the city.”

his promotional materials to market the camps.

GJL Sports Camps began with 24 teams in 
1996, expanding to 185 teams the last time the 
camp was run in 2005. After his contract was not 
renewed, Lanthier said that UCSD began “taking 
steps for Bill Carr to operate team camps.”

Lanthier said he recruited 82 percent of the 
teams participating in that year’s camps, which he 
said provided the campus revenue from the busi-
ness he had built.  

“A central issue in all of our claims were the 
unfair competition laws,” he said in an e-mail.  
“UCSD as a public entity is not subject to the 
unfair competition laws as individual-owned busi-
nesses would be.”

Lanthier said that he had a business relationship 
with Nancy and Wade Vickery, who ran a women’s 
basketball team tournament in San Diego. He said 
the couple wanted to bring their tournament to 
a multi-court facility such as RIMAC Arena, and 
going into business with Lanthier allowed them to 
lower the cost of that process.  

In a 10-2 vote, the jury found that GJL’s eco-
nomic relationship with the Vickerys’ camp would 
have probably resulted in future economic benefit 

to Lanthier. They also unanimously found that 
Edwards intended to disrupt this advantage.

However, when asked if Edwards committed 
wrongful conduct by deceiving the public into 
viewing UCSD camps offered in 2005 as GJL 
camps, jurors answered no by the same 10-2 vote.

While the jury unanimously agreed that Carr 
was involved in the marketing of UCSD’s team 
basketball camp, it also ruled that he did not 
market UCSD’s camps in a manner likely to make 
consumers believe they were operated by GJL.  

Lanthier said that a loophole in the law was 
what ultimately helped UCSD to win the case.  

“It wasn’t enough that Edwards interfered but 
that would have been sufficient if these had been 
individually owned/operated camps, but because 
of the public entity issue the only wrongful act the 
judge would allow us to claim was our other cause, 
which was [the] palming off,” Lanthier said.

Spector, however, said the verdict reflects a vic-
tory for the legal system.

“We are happy that the jury weighed the evi-
dence thoroughly and fairly and that the truth of 
the matter prevailed,” she said.

NATIONAL NEWS — In a rare showing 
of bipartisan cooperation and collec-
tive folly, the House of Representatives 
Education and Labor Committee 
unanimously passed a bill on Nov. 15 
to renew the Higher Education Act. 
Called the College Opportunity and 
Affordability Act of 2007, one of its 
major provisions would be the cre-
ation of “watch lists” of colleges that 
raise tuitions at above-average rates. 
Another part of the bill blames colleges 
for the illegal file-sharing routinely 
perpetuated by students and coerces 
them into coming up with solutions.

According to the College Board; 
the average cost of a four-year pri-
vate school rose to $23,712 for the 
2007-08 accademic year, up 6.3 per-
cent from last year, while the average 
tuition for a four-year public school 
increased to $6,185, up 6.6 percent. In 
contrast, inflation only rose 3.7 percent 
between October 2006 and October 
2007. Because tuition rates are rising 
far beyond inflation, it might seem that 
colleges are unfairly increasing their 
tuitions. The new “watch lists” aim to 
stop universities with large endow-
ments from unfairly passing costs onto 
students.

On the surface, such a measure 
might seem reasonable. However, 
according to a report by Inside Higher 
Ed, the top 10 most-endowed private 
universities increased tuition at below-

average rates this year, while operat-
ing costs and expenses forced private 
schools with smaller endowments to 
raise tuition at a higher rate. Other 
schools that the list affects are public 
institutions in states that appropriate 
less money to public education. 

The University of California system, 
with endowment assets standing at 
$8.7 billion total as of June 2006, would 
actually have 
ended up on the 
list because of the 
7-percent increase 
in fees imple-
mented for the 
2007-08 academic 
year. However, the 
media has already 
lampooned the 
UC system, justifi-
ably in this situa-
tion, for its con-
duct, without the 
need for a “watch 
list” that would unfairly penalize cash-
strapped schools in other parts of the 
nation. Furthermore, the lists do not 
actually do anything other than pro-
vide data that is already available, and 
force states to establish task forces to 
figure out where they can mitigate 
costs. Making schools develop more 
bureaucratic bodies hardly seems like 
a way to help them reduce costs, while 
the lists themselves do not exactly force 
a school to lower its tuition.

With the inclusion of a provision 
backed by the Recording Industry 

Association of America and the Motion 
Picture Association of America that 
targets colleges and students it becomes 
blindingly obvious that Congress has 
no concern for schools. The bill would 
force every school participating in fed-
eral financial aid programs to “develop 
a plan for offering alternatives to illegal 
downloading or peer-to-peer distribu-
tion of intellectual property as well as 

a plan to explore 
technology-based 
deterrents to pre-
vent such illegal 
activity.”

Ignoring the 
many legitimate 
uses for peer-to-
peer file sharing 
of intellectual 
property, such 
as distributing 
patches for soft-
ware, this portion 
of the bill repre-

sents a massive increase in costs for 
colleges. “Alternatives to illegal down-
loading” are RIAA and MPAA code 
words for their puppet organizations 
(such as Napster) that offer a fee-based 
service to download music.

Forcing schools to pay these fees, 
as well as purchasing anti peer-to-
peer networking software, does noth-
ing to enhance the quality of educa-
tion. Instead, such measures would 
lead to an increase in tuition costs 
to fund these anti-downloading mea-
sures, thus contradicting the purpose 

of the “watch lists”. Furthermore, stu-
dents who do not intend to download 
music should not be forced to suffer 
increased costs to satisfy the whims of 
the RIAA.

Moreover, college students are 
unlikely to care about restrictions 
the school places on them. Students 
can either download music through 
a non-university network or sim-
ply a backdoor to whatever network 
restrictions the university puts in 
place. In addition, technical restric-
tions on networks cause problems 
for users conducting legitimate 
activities, such as Resnet’s securi-
ty feature that cuts off a student’s 
Internet connection at the first hint 
of trouble, even if it turns out that 
there was no actual security risk. 
While Resent can justify its actions 
in the name of maintaining school 
network security, it is immoral to 
allow misguided attempts at pre-
serving corporate profits in a failing 
music industry to interrupt student 
use of a university network.

Renewing the Higher Education 
Act should be one of Congress’ top 
priorities, and it is refreshing to see 
bipartisan efforts toward a common 
goal for once. However, ill-advised 
and foolhardy modifications to the 
act are not in the best interests of the 
universities and students that these 
legislators claim to serve.

Oh dear god, the holiday sea-son has arrived. And if it only meant added family 
time, better eats, Christmas deco-
rating and celebrating Jesus’ birth 
— despite my spiritual limbo — I’d 
be down for all the hoo-ha. 

But of course, the hordes of hys-
terical shoppers rearing to empty 
their wallets and fill their hands are 
flooding malls nationwide as usual. 
In fact, their presence during last 
week’s Black Friday — the year’s 
official kickoff for holiday shopping 
— was stronger than ever, accord-
ing to big-name retailers like Sears, 
Macy’s Inc. and Toys “R” Us. Despite 
the economic downturn and appar-
ent dormany of consumerism in the 
previous months, folks still turned 
out more determined and ridiculous 
than ever to shop, shop, shop. 

And that’s what I don’t under-
stand — the mad, almost kamikaze-
like behavior that infects shoppers 
around the holidays. And then every 
year, despite my hopes that people 
will somehow come to their senses, 
the crowds get crazier. 

This year, for example, Kohl’s 
stores nationwide opened their 
doors at 4 a.m. — an hour earlier 
than last year — so the impatient, 
paranoid shoppers could beat the 
sleepers and score extra savings on 
useless items. Buyers took the bait.  

Sears and Macy’s were a similar 
story; both stores greeted with long 
lines of anxious consumers before 
doors were even set to open. The 
Macy’s in New York City’s Herald 
Square, which normally opens at 6 
a.m. the Friday after Thanksgiving, 
was forced to welcome the throng 
of people at 5:30 a.m. to ebb the 
line of 3,000 people that formed 
outside the shop’s doors. Now that’s 
just silly. 

While I can understand and 
even sympathize with the pressure 
of finding that perfect gift on a tight 
budget, I have to wonder where we 
draw the line in the shopping mad-
ness. 

Don’t people care about beauty 
sleep anymore, or have they become 
that desperate? And what about 
years from now, will consumers 
arrive at 2 a.m. instead of 4 a.m. to 
claim their goods? 

And if all this preplanning is 
really necessary to check off all the 
names on our Christmas lists, then 
it’s time to reexamine our holiday 
priorities. I love shoes, coats and 
gadgets as much as the next girl, but 
hell, darkness was made for sleeping 
— not for shopping. 

I will, however, admit the lure 
of holiday sales. This past weekend 
I nearly found myself caught up 
in the spending euphoria during a 
harmless expedition to Target for 
Christmas decor. 

My brother, like every other 
American 8-year-old, is requesting a 
Nintendo Wii this Christmas. And, 
like parents everywhere, mine were 
without the perfect gift and instead 

Universal Care will Solve to 
Soaring Insurance Costs

Dear Editor,
While the health care crisis in 

America has been a prominent issue 
in the current presidential campaign, 
here at UCSD it seems to be all but 
irrelevant. Since all students have 
medical coverage, either through the 
university or private insurers, this is 
understandable.  However, what hap-
pens to UCSD’s 26,000 students when 
they graduate and enter the real world, 
where there is no built-in health safety 
net to catch them?  

A single person’s yearly health 
insurance premium is, on average, 
about $4,300. That’s more than most 
recent graduates will make in a month 
(or two, even). Instead of saving up to 
some day own a home, raise a family or 
simply move beyond a top-ramen diet, 
alumni from UCSD and every other 

university in the country will have to 
sacrifice financial health to help ensure 
physical health.  

This is (obviously) no fault of the 
universities, but rather another exam-
ple of why the U.S. health care system 
is seriously faulty and must be radically 
reformed.  

If the proud owner of a hard-earned 
college degree has to move back in 
with mom and dad to pay his pre-
mium, then one of two things must be 
true: either 1) health care costs in the 
United States are obscene, or 2) college 
is a waste of time (isn’t the whole point 
to get away from the folks?).  

Universal, single-payer govern-
ment-sponsored health insurance 
would solve much of what ails health 
care in the United States.  

It would drastically reduce 
administrative costs (currently 
about 1/3 of the total cost of insur-
ance), since there would be only one 
insurer instead of several scram-

bling to send, receive and organize 
incomplete records about the same 
patient. Administration itself would 
become much more efficient as well. 
Furthermore, single-payer insurance 
does not mean a “government take-
over” of hospitals, clinics and private 
practices.  

Doctors, nurses and other health 
care workers would still be paid and 
managed solely by their current 
employers. Instead of spending hours 
on the phone begging a for-profit 
insurance company to pay for their 
patients’ surgery, they could spend 
those hours actually performing the 
surgery.  

That should please students at 
the UCSD School of Medicine, who 
probably are in school to become 
doctors, not solicitors.

Health care reform might be a 
phantom issue to college students 
right now, but in just a few years it 
will become extremely relevant — 

unpleasantly so. Covering it now will 
give students a chance to act and help 
change the system before it swallows 
them whole. Or, at the least, let them 
know they should start saving up.

met only by sold-out stores.
My stepmom called it a holiday 

nightmare because there was just no 
chance at finding another gift. After 
all, my parents would be the last to 
spoil my brother’s belief in Santa. So 
of course, during my battle with the 
masses at Target, I wandered — more 
like pushed my way through scream-
ing kids and miles of carts — over to 
the electronics section hoping to save 
the day. 

And there they were: the last two 
Nintendo Wii consoles in the entire 
store, and likely all of San Diego 
County. 

Hopping in line and buzzed with 
the rush of achievement and victory, 

I waited my turn in the check-out line 
for what seemed like nearly an hour. 

And when the clerk finally hand-

ed over that pearly white box, I did a 
little happy dance inside. But soon my 
excitement faded and I felt embar-

rassed by my desperation. I had just 
boiled down the Christmas spirit to 
the short-lived joy of obtaining a silly 
game console that will be “so last sea-
son” a year from now. 

So with Wii in hand, I left Target 
feeling torn — I was relieved because 
my brother could go another year 
blissfully believing in the red-suited 
fat man, but saddened by my lack of 
understanding of the holiday. In an 
effort to boost my morale, I made a 
resolution. 

This year, I’m going to handle 
Christmas like an adult should — 
calm, cool and collected — and I’m 
going to put aside the fretting over 
gifts and remember all the things it’s 
really about.

Normally, UCSD students make dozens of decisions every day: which dining hall to eat at, which classes to take, 
which party to go to. But what if they didn’t
have the right to decide the way they live their own lives? For the citi-
zens of the Union of Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia formally 
called Burma and plagued by military coups and control since the 
1960s, such restrictions are a part of everyday reality.

The country’s current leader, Senior General Than Shwe, assumed 
power from its original socialist dictatorship and has since imple-
mented strict laws, choking the civil liberties of the Myanmar people 
and placing them in grave danger. 

Currently, more than 1,400 political prisoners remain under arrest, 
and thousands more continue to disappear from their homes each 
night. Internet access has been cut within the country, phone lines are 
monitered and journalists are threatened with violence for reporting 
any information to outside governments or agencies.

Three refugees, Sein, Keh Heh and Donoo, came to UCSD as part 
of the Free Burma teach-in that took place Nov. 19 in Great Hall. They 
were part of a speaking panel that also included Karma Lekshe Tsomo, 
a professor of theology and religious studies at the University of San 
Diego, and Tim Hardy, a Myanmar civil rights activist and former 
refugee. 

A collaborative teach-in sponsored by International Affairs Group, 
Amnesty International, Coalition of South Asian Peoples, Coalition 
of Asian and Pacific Islanders, Art of Living and Sixth College 
Residential Life, Free Burma was comprised of a panel of speakers and 
presentations which informed students about the current conflict in 
the country, and included several petitions and resolution stations at 
which students were encouraged to participate with their new aware-
ness of the issue. The event was also affiliated with International 
Rescue Committee, an organization dedicated to the resettlement of 
refugees like Sein. 

Students were also given a chance to ask the panel’s speakers ques-
tions. And although hesitant at first, many students were eager to 
discuss the conflict with the educators to learn more and find out what 
they could do to help. 

“Most students don’t even know where Burma is,” said Harrison 
Seung, a Revelle College senior and member of Asian Pacific Islanders. 
“I don’t think students know what’s going on there, and for a school 
with such a large Asian population, it’s a big deal, even if the news isn’t 
covering the conflict anymore.”

While Hardy discussed the country’s history and the swift political 
changes that have recently occurred, Tsomo addressed the religious 
and social aspects of life for the citizens of Myanmar. Residents live 
in fear of political persecution by their own government. About 90 
percent of the villagers of Myanmar are Buddhists, and the ideology of 
nonviolence and peace associated with the religion has left them help-
less in the hands of cruel military regimes.

Thankful for a Day of Idleness
Iam far from the only UCSD student that headed north for Thanksgiving. With so many of us having come from Northern 
California, a long vacation exodus is a common 
experience. And, no matter how much we lament 
the traffic or cost of gas or plane tickets, a lot of 
seniors like me have made this trek four or more 
times now, even though we go home a few weeks 
later for winter break anyway.  

What I looked forward to this year was three 
Thanksgivings. Starting on the actual holiday, 
three nights found me having dinner first with my 
immediate family and then 
with two sides of extended 
relatives. Like any fam-
ily gathering, I was not the 
only one with a camera in 
hand. But with a succes-
sion of festivities I was in 
the unique position to com-
pare the events and gain an 
understanding of where family idiosyncrasies end 
and the national holiday begins.

 This Thanksgiving, I decided beforehand to 
take pictures that could resonate with a larger 
audience, and leave the group snapshots to some-
one else. Maybe then, I thought, I could get to the 
heart of the holiday and elevate my family to the 
status of archetypal characters of the holiday tradi-
tion, maybe like an updated scene from a Norman 
Rockwell painting. So I began looking for symbols 
to incorporate. The turkey was the most obvious 
place to start. Photographing everyone’s relation to 
the turkey seemed like a safe bet. After all, even if 
I failed to capture the essence of Thanksgiving, at 

least people would recognize which holiday I was 
trying to describe.

What I discovered, beginning with the turkey 
and radiating outward, was a holiday centered 
on rituals of waiting. It seemed to be the natural 
manifestation of a tradition demanding the prepa-
ration of a bird that takes all day to cook. With 
so much free time, it was interesting to focus on 
how my different family members spent their idle 
hours: the men watched football and drank beer 
on the patio; my grandmother, aunt and mother 
collaborated on the final dinner preparations; 

my cousin played with her 
young children and chatted 
with my sister. I found relief 
in the instant gratification of 
the LCD screen on my brand 
new digital camera. Among 
my family, though, sub-
conscious lines of thought 
would cross, and conversa-

tions around the household would wander from 
the subject of how much time the turkey had left 
to chronicling how much time I had until gradu-
ation; from stressing about an upcoming vacation 
to cooing about when my sister-in-law would have 
her baby.  

Toward the end of my three Thanksgiving 
dinners the specifics of my family’s travails were 
blending together into a larger picture. With 
millions of Americans celebrating Thanksgiving, 
I understood that in a larger context it did not 
matter what my family was talking about, since 
certainly a lot of people were similarly using 
Thanksgiving to relieve the stress. It was then that 

I stopped seeing the individual worries of my fam-
ily, and the national holiday revealed itself.

I didn’t spend much time adhering to my 
duty as an objective photographer. With every-
one sitting around hungry, communicating their 
desires and not actually doing much that could 
be described visually, it did not take long to docu-
ment the family spectrum anyway. I was fortunate 
enough to get my serious efforts out of the way 

before I became drugged with tryptophan and 
the nostalgic urge to photograph family pets took 
over my camera. For all of us, the wait for turkey 
had given way, finally, to stretched stomachs and 
pumpkin pie. And, for a while, everyone’s thoughts 
were not on what the future needed to bring.

8 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2007

By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer

On the Friday after Thanksgiving, 
John Muir College senior Anna 
Chun woke up at 4 a.m. to three 
alarms; one on her clock, one on 
her cell phone and another on her 
laptop. 

Chun is an associate at Express 
in Westfield Shoppingtown UTC 
and had to be at work at 5 a.m. 
Because of the expected crowds, 
employees were not allowed to park 
at the mall. Because Chun lives near 
UTC, she opted to walk, rather than 
follow her bosses’ suggestions to 
park at the Regents lots and take a  
shuttle to the mall.

Black Friday, the day after 
Thanksgiving, is the first shop-
ping day of the holiday season, and 
is aptly named after the fact that 
retailers are “back in the black” — 
turning a profit. Some stores open 
as early as 5 a.m. and offer deals to 
attract customers that are only valid 
until a certain time.

The UTC parking lot was fill-
ing up, lines were forming outside 
stores and people were already car-
rying bags — all before 6:30 a.m. 

On a regular weekend at Express, 
there may be five or six people work-
ing on the floor during peak hours, 
with two or three people stocking 
items. During Black Friday, there 
were 15 to 20 people working on 
the floor during peak hours with 10 
to 12 people stocking. To prepare 
for the holiday season, 119 people 
needed to be employed by mid-
November, as opposed to about 40 
people that are employed during the 
rest of the year.

Chun had worked at a retail store 
during Black Friday once before, 
and though she anticipated Express 
to be very chaotic, with customers 
and employees running around and 
no time to rest, she didn’t think cus-
tomers would be so unruly.

“I worked at a smaller store, 
which was crazy enough,” she said. 
“[But on Friday,] we had this woman 
almost curse at us. I thought she 
was going to eat my head off. I put 
lines along the cash wrap so that 
people would know where to stand 
in line, and she wasn’t standing near 
any of them. Then she yelled at us 
saying that she was waiting for us 
and saying that we were trying to 
get smart with her.” 

Although in-store sales are thriv-
ing, people like Denise Nguyen, a 
parent and Chula Vista resident, 
said that the Internet and Web sites 
like www.bfads.net make it easier to 
search for bargain items and com-
pare prices.

“I don’t have to waste time wait-
ing in a lot of lines at different 
stores,” she said.

Before Thanksgiving, Amazon.
com had a contest where consumers 
could vote for a number of products 
that they would like to purchase 
at a big discount. Each product 
has their own buying day, and on 
that day, consumers are randomly 

selected to get the deal that they 
voted for in that round. 

Express associates hosted a pot-
luck so that they did not have to 
waste time at the food court during 
their lunch breaks.

“Everyone brought in something 
to eat; we had drinks, sweets and 
bagels, but I actually tried to go get 
some food in the food court during 
my break,” Chun said. “By the time I 
got my food, my break was over.”

Chun’s workday was hectic and 
exhausting. Although she had been 
anticipating working on Friday, she 
was thrilled when the long day was 
over.

“I actually was super excited to 
open,” she said. “Sounds crazy, but 
you get a rush when you’re con-
stantly busy. I actually like working 
when its super busy because  the 
time goes by much  more quickly. 
After my shift was done, I was so 
exhausted. I went home and napped 
literally for three hours.”

v3do@ucsd.edu.

“It’s important for students to 
be aware of justice and injustice in 
the world,” Tsomo said. “As young 
adults, their energy and passion can 
be effectively channeled to change 
trouble spots, like [Myanmar] or 
Tibet. It’s the responsibility of every 
human being to correct injustice, 
especially those people who have a 
voice and can use that voice.”

Although Free Burma’s main 
focus was its panel of speakers that 
offered revealing information about 
the current situation and histori-
cal significance of 
the civil conflict 
in Myanmar, many 
students came early 
and stayed late in 
order to write let-
ters to the U.N. 
Security Council, 
or to sign electronic 
petitions as part of 
the U.S. campaign 
for Myanmar. 

Students attend-
ing the event were 
also given buttons 
to demonstrate their support, and 
many felt strongly about the politi-
cal and social conflicts occurring in 
a country so far from San Diego.

Sixth College senior Tara 
Ramanathan supervised the peti-
tion stations and informed students 
of the nature of the resolutions that 
were being sent to both local and 
national security commissions. 

“Students, as citizens, need to 
become aware of this issue and take 
action,” Ramanathan said. “The 
point of the [Free Burma] event is 
to get people concerned, make them 
aware, and to inspire and motivate 
them. We would need hundreds of 
thousands of signatures to really 
make an impact, but this is a good 
step in the right direction.” 

The petition tables remained 
full of students both before and 
after the teach-in, and Karen Yang, 
an Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior and member of Amnesty 
International, said she was pleased 
with the turnout. 

Enlarged photographs of 
Buddhist monks, the populous’ 
chosen leaders of revolution, stood 
at the hall’s entrance and capti-
vated attendees with their shocking 
nature. 

The monks were seen peacefully 
protesting in front of armed soldiers, 

and the series 
of photographs 
told the rest of 
the story: brawls 
and riots; san-
dals and shoes 
left behind in 
the bloody cob-
blestone streets; 
one man face 
down in a river 
of blood and 
monks refusing 
religious alms 
and ultimately 

bribes from the military regime. 
These photographs were shock-

ing to some students but informa-
tive for others.

“You see that life isn’t just black 
and white, but still a lot of peo-
ple don’t care,” Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Lawrence Lau 
said. “But if students don’t care about 
this, what do they care about?”

While Sein’s speech marked the 
end of the Free Burma teach-in,  his 
words summarized the importance 
of the discussion for all people.

“When you are happy, don’t for-
get those who suffer,” he said. “Don’t 
forget about us.”

“We picked it up after the slow start 
though.” 

The Tritons turned it up with 
5:25 left in the first half, going on a 
14-6 run to enter halftime with a 10-
point lead. Though the Tritons shot 
a mediocre 39 percent, Osier held 
up her squad by 
netting 13 points 
in the first half.

UCSD’s shoot-
ing struggles 
continued in the 
second half, but 
its lead continued 
to expand. The 
Tritons took 14 
three-point shots 
in the second half, 
getting many of 
their points from 
their six converted 
long-balls. In the 
end, the Tritons took the win despite 
shooting under 39 percent from the 
field. Osier led the team with 16 
points and 13 rebounds, while Noud 
added 12 points and senior guard 
Kaycie Bull added 10 points. 

According to Gaskin, the Tritons’ 
perseverance outweighed their low 
field-goal percentage and allowed 
them to run away with the win.

“There were times that we were 
not as strong as a team, but we 
kept fighting and never gave up,” 
Gaskin said. “We played really well 
together.” 

This weekend, the Tritons will 
play their first home games as well as 
their first conference games, facing 
off against Cal State Stanislaus on 

Nov. 30 and No. 
15 Chico State 
on Dec. 1. The 
Tritons last faced 
Chico State in 
the Division II 
West Regional 
Championship 
game last sea-
son in which the 
Tritons defeated 
the Wildcats to 
advance to the 
Elite Eight. The 
Tritons are hop-

ing that they can repeat this success.
“We’re finally playing at home 

which is a big thing,” Elliott said. 
“When we play conference games, 
the intensity drastically goes up. 
Everyone’s excited about being at 
home. Chico State was picked to 
finish second in the conference and 
we were picked to finish third, so it 
should be tough.”

a few steps ahead of them, both in expe-
rience and in talent,” Blum said. “This 
year the men’s epee squad received a 
considerable infusion of new talent from 
freshmen and a transfer student, which 
was key to defeating Fullerton 7-2.”

On the women’s side, the score was 
just as lopsided in favor of the Tritons, 
who made quick work of the visiting 
teams, finishing off Cal Tech 24-3, Cal 
State Fullerton 23-4 and UC Irvine 
25-2. Junior Zitin Kachru posted a 5-0 
mark in foil to lead the Tritons. 

Sophomore Anne Marie Schnecker 
attributed her team’s success to the feel-
ing of team unity and the overall ability 
of this year’s squad.

“We have a really good team, and 
we all pump each other up,” Schnecker 
said. “Also there is a lot of talent on 
our team, so if we keep working to our 

potential at practice I think we will 
have a successful season.”

Head coach Heidi Runyan is looking 
forward to the NCAA West Invitational 
in Colorado Springs, Col., as the meet 
that will truly pose a challenge to her 
team this season, but Runyan said she is 
confident that her players will be able to 
thrive by combining veteran leadership 
and skilled newcomers.

“The team won’t really be tested 
until mid-January,” Runyan said. “If 
everybody fences to their potential we 
have a good chance to beat Division I 
rivals Stanford and Air Force.”

Runyan said that some new faces 
will add to the already powerful men’s 
squad, and the fresh talent has renewed 
hopes of UCSD capturing a conference 
championship.

“We have quite a few new solid fenc-
ers that add real depth to the team,” she 

said. “All three men’s squads are very 
strong this year. We have a good chance 
of bringing home the men’s epee con-
ference trophy, which has eluded us the 
last few years.”

In addition, Runyan is confident 
that the women’s team will again do 
well this year, and said that three veter-
ans are in contention for an individual 
conference title, including senior and 
All-American Chelsea Ambort, who 
went 8-1 at the home-opener.

With a balanced combination of 
talented underclassmen and seasoned 
veterans, the UCSD fencing team 
seems poised to continue their early 
domination throughout their season 
as they steadily gain more momen-
tum leading up to the NCAA National 
Championships in Columbus, Ohio, 
from March 13 through March 16.

had not seen happen in recent years.
“I knew that having both the men 

and women reach nationals was some-
thing that we were capable of,” Garcia 
said. “Starting any year you never real-
ly know exactly how things can come 
together but you always have an idea of 
what you would like to see your team 
accomplish. I would say that we did 
meet all of the goals that we set out for 

and even did better than most people 
would have guessed. I’m real proud of 
all my runners.”

Garcia is already looking down the 
road toward his second season, and 
said he is hoping that his team will be 
able to build off this year’s success.

“What we do now is take the expe-
rience that we gained at the National 
Championships and apply it to next 
year,” Garcia said. “We are losing three 

runners on the women’s side so that 
means that we have to have the return-
ing runners step up, and luckily we 
did have non-seniors at nationals, too. 
We’re only losing one runner from the 
men, so next year we need them to 
take the knowledge that they gained 
from such a high level of competition 
and bring it back to the runners that 
weren’t able to make the trip to nation-
als this year.”

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2007

Senior Staff Writer

The fencing team opened its 
home schedule on Nov. 17 with a 
statement, sweeping a meet that 
included UC Irvine, Cal State 
Fullerton and the California Institute 
of Technology. The Tritons were 
coming off a resounding win two 
weekends earlier in Pasadena where 
they also swept some of the top 
schools on the West Coast. These 
early victories bode well for the 
Triton fencing team, which will be 
relying on its younger players to take 
the lead throughout the season. 

The home meet saw the men’s 
team demolish its opponents, beat-
ing Cal Tech University 24-3, Cal 
State Fullerton 22-5 and UC Irvine 
23-4. Sophomores Sean Blum and 
Bryan Kim led the Tritons with an 
8-1 mark in epee and a perfect 7-0 
record in saber, respectively.

Blum said he was very happy 
with his team’s victory, but was not 
surprised by its success so early in 
the season.

“We usually beat those teams 
because the program here at UCSD is

After a three-week break, the 
women’s basketball team shook off 
the rust to cruise to double-digit vic-
tories in both of its games over the 
Thanksgiving weekend. The Tritons 
earned a 61-42 win against Western 
New Mexico University on Nov. 23 at 
the Grand Canyon Classic in Phoenix, 
Ariz., and beat Fort Lewis College of 
Durango, Col., by a score of 76-64 on 
Nov. 24 to capture the tournament title. 
With these lopsided wins, the Tritons 
will start 
the season 
with a 5-0 
record for 
the first 
time in 
school his-
tory. 

UCSD’s matchup against Fort Lewis 
College started out close, with both 
teams shooting three-pointers early in 
the game. With 15:24 left on the clock 
and the score tied at eight, the Tritons 
went to their low-post game as senior 
center Alexis Gaskin scored two of 
her career-high 26 points to give the 
Tritons a lead that they maintained for 
the rest of the contest.

The game remained close for the 
rest of the half, but the Tritons kept 
their lead by feeding the ball to Gaskin 
in the low post. Senior forward Meghan 
Noud added three three-pointers for 
the Tritons, helping them take a 37-30 
lead at halftime.

UCSD started out strong in the sec-
ond half, outscoring Fort Lewis 23-13 
in the first 10 minutes. The Tritons had 
continued success against Fort Lewis 
College’s zone defense, and UCSD’s 
60-43 lead midway through the second 
half was enough to earn the win.

First-year head coach Charity Elliot 
is already seeing promising results from 
her squad, and said she was pleased 
with the team’s performance at the 
Grand Canyon Classic.

“We made some very good team 
decisions and got the ball inside to 
Gaskin, who was posting up,” Elliott 

said. 
In addition to her 26 points to lead 

the Tritons, Gaskin had a game-high 
13 rebounds with five offensive boards. 
The Tritons also shot 45 percent from 
beyond the arc, with Noud and junior 
forward Michelle Osier hitting three 
and two three-pointers, respectively. 

Noud netted 19 total points for UCSD 
and Osier added 12 points. 

After nearly three weeks of practice 
— the Tritons haven’t played a game 
since Nov. 4 — UCSD played Western 
New Mexico on Nov. 23 and picked up 
an easy win against the Mustangs.

Although the team ran away with 

victory, UCSD had an admittedly lack-
luster start that allowed Western New 
Mexico to gain ground.

“We were anxious to play some 
games, but we started out a little slow,” 
senior forward Alexis Mezzetta said.

The cross country team concluded 
one of its most successful seasons on 
Nov. 17 when both the men’s and 
women’s teams excelled at the NCAA 
Division II National Championships 
in Joplin, Mo. The women finished in 
11th place, five places higher than their 
2006 finish, while the men placed 20th, 
their best performance since 2003.

For first-year head coach Nate 
Garcia, the success of his rookie cam-
paign was a great achievement, but 
he said he felt that the achievements 
were due to his team’s hard work and 
dedication. 

“I came into a real good situation 
here as head coach of UCSD,” Garcia 
said.  “There was already a really good 
program in place with a good his-
tory. My main job was just not to 
screw things up. We had a great squad 
of returning players combined with a 
new group of players that brought an 
awesome level of energy with them. 
That all really helped to make my job a 
whole lot easier.”

Senior Emily McGregor led the 
Triton women with a time of 21:38.9, 
good enough for a 31st-place fin-
ish. Fellow senior Diane Dunn was 
right behind McGregor, finishing 
in 36th place with a time of 21:47.3 
in the women’s 6K race. There were 
189 participants in the women’s race, 
and UCSD also saw senior Amanda 
Burkhardt take 85th, junior Ashleigh 
Montgomery place 99th and freshman 
Jessie Bodenhamer finish 104th. 

As a senior, the strong finish was 
especially important for Dunn.

“Finishing high at nationals is a 
nice recognition of all the hard work 
that we’ve put in this past year as well 
as over the last four years,” Dunn said. 
“It was a very surreal experience run-
ning in my last cross country race, 
but I’m really proud of the team that 
I was running with and everything 
that we’ve accomplished. It was great 
to be at the race with both a men’s and 
women’s team. Not very many schools 
have both genders at the meet so it 
really is a testament to our team and 
our program that we can bring both.”  

The Triton men were led by sopho-
more Jesse Morrill, who ran the men’s 
10K course in a time of 32:52.7 to earn 
96th place. The men’s national cham-
pionship race hosted 187 runners, and 
UCSD placed all of its participants in 
the top 130. Senior Greg Geldman and 
juniors Jake LeVieux, Kevin Klein and 
Gabe LaMothe rounded out the Triton 
men’s finishes, all crossing the finish 
line in 33:43.3 or less. 

Garcia said he was proud the men’s 
and women’s squads performed so well 
at nationals, something that UCSD
