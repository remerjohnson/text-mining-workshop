Staff Writer 

Nearly 200 San Diego students 
and community partners marched 
the streets of downtown San 
Diego on Oct. 21 in hopes of 
increasing awareness and support 
for a living wage ordinance. 

tarting at San Diego City 
College, students and fellow sup-
porter of the campaign charged 
ahead at 3 p.m. and did not stop 
until they reached the steps of 
City Hall. 

tudents and supporters bran-
dished signs with slogans like, 
"Let us afford to live in San 
Diego," while chanting cheers as 
they marched to rally in front of 
City Ilali. The march was orga-
nized to rai e s~ppOrt from city 
cO llncil members and increase 
awareness of the Responsible 
Wage and Health Care Benefits 
Ordinance throughout the com-
munity. 

The San Diego Living Wage 
Campaign began over a year ago, 
but the nationwide effort to raise 
wages and health benefit coverage 
started in 1994, and has since suc-
ceeded in establishing 110 living 
wage laws throughout the United 
States. Created in order to combat 
increased living expenses and aid

wage ordinance seeks to "require 
employers who benefit from con-
tracts, subsidies or other public 
resources to pay a 'living wage' 
and provide health benefits." 

In local tenns, the living wage 
ordinance proposed for the City 
of San Diego would set pay for

operators, janitors and security 

guards, at a minimum of $11.95

A new bill introduced to 
Congress by Rep. Howard P. 
"Buck" McKeon (R-CA) could pun-
ish colleges that are implementing 
"exorbitant ruition hikes" by cutting 
off federal funding of certain loans 
and grants to the schools, speci fical-
Iy funds for work-study programs. 

"For over 20 years, schools have 
been raising tuition," McKeon said. 
"I'm hopeful that now they will do 
a bener job." 

Under the proposed bill, H .R. 
HII, public institutions through-
out the nation would be measured 
against a set College Affordability 
Index, penalizing schools that raise 
student fees by at least $500 more 
than twice the inflation rate in any 
three-year period. Certain provi-
sions of the bill would exclude 
schools whose ruition was ranked in 
the bottom quarter of schools in 
their category. 

"I'm hopeful that the California 
schools will fit into that category," 
McKeon said. 

The University of California, 
after seven ycars without fee hikes, 
raised its ruition 30 percent last year. 

"The university has done an 
excellent job at keeping co ts down, 
and only raised fees as a last resort," 
said Chri Harrington , a UC 
pokesperson in Washington, D.C. 

While the University of 
California has not taken a tance on 
the issue, they are currently review-
ing the bill to assess its potential 
impact before taking a po ition, 
according to Harrington . 

Pell grants, Stafford loans and 
other federal grants issued directly 
to students from the government 
would not be affected. 

The bill also aims to eliminate 
barriers for students in transferring 
credits from one public institution 
to another. 

While the finalized bill was 
unveiled on Oct. t6, some educa-
tion officials have come out against 
the proposed bill si nce its concep-
tion in March.

BRIEFLY 
Web-based forum focuses 

on Arabic studies 
The University of California Consortium 

for Language Learning & Teaching has been 
awarded a $452,600 ~rant by the U.s. 
Department of Educa~on In order to create a 
long-distance Arabic course. The course, 
which will be called "Arabic Without Walls: 
will allow undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents 0 pursue a year-long course in the 
study of Arabic in a Web-based forum 
focused on developing listening. speaking. 
reading and writing skills. 

The program is expected to begin in fall 
2005 with about 60 students. 

The class IS modeled after "Spanish 
Without Wa lls: an online long-distance 
course which has been offered through UC 
Davis for three years. Currently, Arabic is 
only taught at UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC 
Santa Barbara. 'Arabic Without Walls' will 
be based at UC Berkeley. UC faculty will 
have to be able to access the course's sup-
plementary materials, and upper-division 
graduate students will be offered the 
opportunity to serve as program teaching 
assistants. 

The program will be co-authored and dis-
tributed over a period of three years by the 
UC Consortium for Language Learning & 
Teaching and the National Middle East 
Language Resource Center at Brigham Young 
University. Robert J. Blake, director of the con-
sortium, and Kirk Belnap, of the NMELRC, will 
lead a team of Arabic experts in producing 
the DVD-ROM and Web-based materials for 
the project. 

The UC Consortium for Language 
Learning & Teaching was founded in 2000 as 
a systemwide effort to maximize the 
University of Califomia's foreign language 
resources. 

UCSD Open House to be

CalPIRG launches study 
Site to collect voter registration info 

By MARGRET GONZALES 
Contributing Writer 

In hopes of convincing the 
California state legislature to 
adopt same-day voter registration, 
Cal Vote, a Web site launched by 
the student public interest group 
CaIPIRG, plans to compile by 
January 2004 a report of case 
studies submitted by students that 
were unable to vote in the Oct. 7 
election due to the conflicting 
dates of move-in day and the reg-
istration deadline. 

Because the registration dead-
line date coincides with move-in 
week, CalPIRG co-chair Matt 
Reents claims students were tOO 
busy 10 change their address or 
forgot to re-register for their 
absentee ballot. 

"Even before CalVote was 
launched, we had already found a 
number of students who wanted 
to submit storie of their inability 
to vote because move-in day was 
the sa me day the deadli ne for 
voter registration was," Reents 
said. "Many students considered 
moving into their donns at the top 
of their priorities; there were too 
many distractions." 

In recognizing same-day voter 
registration, CalPIRG hopes to 
increase the number of students 
who participate in California's 
political process by increasing the 
srudent-voter turnout. 

"The idea behind same-day 
registration is to permit the stu-
dent to know what each candi-
date 's campaign is, hopefully 
encouraging them to vote," Reents 
said. "Many students don't even 
know abour each candidate's cam-
paign. They don't educate them-

selves prior to a few weeks before 
the election, and many candidates' 
platforms don't gel out until after 
the voter registration deadline." 

Some students believe their 
ignorance of the political plat-
forms deterred them from the 
voting booths, but the alternative 
of the absentee ballot provides no 
excuse for not registering. 

"I didn't vote primarily because 
not knowing each of the candi-

" Many students don't 
even know about each 
candidate's campaign." 

- Matt Reents, CalPIRG co-dNIir 

dates' policies prevented me from 
having a definite stand," Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore Maiu 
Fukui said. "I would have voted ifI 
was more aware of the issues. 

"However, when people say, 'I 
didn't know about re-registering 
for the absentee ballots,' that's just 
not a valid excuse; they should have 
known," Fukui said. "America 
should not have to accommodate 
the srudents of UCSD. n 

Earl Warren College senior 
Arthur Mong was able to vote by 
submitting his absentee ballot. He 
believes that same-day voter regis-
tration would not make a differ-
ence in the student-voter turnout. 

"The people who really 
intended to vote would already be 
registered prior to the deadline, n 
Mong said. "People who say -they 
didn't vote becau e they didn't

know about the absentee ballot 
are illogical since you are told 
about [the absentee ballot] weeks 
before the deadline." 

Warren freshman Divya 
Thapar was unable to vote 
because she did not receive her 
absentee ballot in the mail, 
though she has been registered to 
vote since August. By Oct. 7, 
Thapar still had not received her 
absentee ballot. 

"I wanted to vote, but I could-
n't," Thapar said. "The October 
election was just complicated. I 
believe some people were misled 
to think they had more time to reg-
ister than they actually did. 
Because the original court ruling 
said that the election would be 
postponed indefinitely, students 
thought they had more time to 
register. But the coun decision was 
overturned and the election was 
recommenced for the planned 
date." 

CalPIRG hopes to expand on a 
pilot program in Alameda County, 
which examined same-day voter 
registration all across the state. 

"There is not a lot of negative 
feedback against the security issue 
of same-day voter registration, but 
[others) worry about the possible 
influence voters will receive prior 
to the ballot box, but this has not 
happened in my of the pilot pro-
grams," Reents said. 

"College students are consid-
ered the most political and activist 
age bracket, yet we only account 
for 7 percent because many stu-
dents are turned away from the 
voting process," Reents said. 
"Same-day voter registration will 
hopefully bring these numbers 
up."

Lab: Management changes 
coincide with appointment 

continued from page I 
competition in the laboratory man-
agement environment. The work 
of the national laboratories is criti-
cal to our nation's security, and Bob 
has the experience, the drive and 
the leadership abilities to ensure 
that scientific and technological 
brealcthroughs continue." 

foley brings over a half-centu-
ry of experience in defense and 
energy to the position. A graduate 
of the U.S_ Naval Academy, Foley 
server! as both commander of the 
U.S. 7th Fleet and the comman-
der-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet, both of which included 
nuclear forces, during his 35-year 
military career. After leaving the 
military, Foley also served as assis-
tant secretary of defense for 
defense programs and assistant 
secretary of energy during the 
Reagan administration. He also 
has extensive experience in indus-
try, having served as a consultant 
for ICF Kaiser Engineering and 
defense contractor Raytheon 
Corporation. 

foley's appoinonent comes dur-
ing a time of change for the nation-
al laboratories. In January 2003, 
then-Vice President for 
Laboratory Management John P. 
McTague and then-Los Alamos 
director John. C. Brown resigned 
after a presidential probe found 
cases ofloss or theft of government 
property and other business-prac-
tice issues at Los Alamos. In 
response to the probe, the 
Deparunent of Energy announced 
in April that it would place the con-
tract to run Los Alamos ational 
Laboratory up for bidding for the 
first time in its 60-year history 
under the University of California. 

"Although [the university] has-
n't made a decision yet, we are 

preparing to compete," said UC 
Senior Vice President for 
University Affairs Bruce B. 

Darlin~. Darling is currently serv-
ing as lhe interim vice president of 
laboratory management. 

"The big issue is going to be 
how the Department of Energy 
weighs the importance of science 
in these labs," Darling said . "If the 
Department of Energy constructs 
the competition in a way that 
weighs heavily the attributes the 
University of California brings to 
the labs, then I think that will 
affect the way the regents go for -
ward." 

Combined, the three laboratories 
have an operating budget of over 
$7.5 billion and employ over 20,000 
UC staff members. Despite the 
recent controversy surrounding the 
university'S administration of the 
laboratories, Foley expressed confi-
dence in his ability to overcome the 
laboratories' problems. 

"We will look at what will be 
the best way to improve the [busi-
ness] practices, to upgrade the cal-
iber of the sciences, and to look at 
successful business models," Foley 
said. "We will look at everything 
across the board. 

"I've got a lot of experience 
running big operations - fleets, 
battle groups - which involve a lot 
of people under conditions of 
stress," Foley said . "I've got a lot of 
experience over the yea rs in the 
Navy and also in my couple years 
as assistant secretary of defense 
programs. The last couple years 
[while chairing an advisory com-
mittee] at Los Alamos, there have 
been hiccups." 

foley will begin his work as vice 
president of laboratory manage-
ment on ov. I and will earn an 
annual salary of 350,900.

Revoking work,study 
not answer to fee hikes 
T he Affordability in Higher Education Act 

was introduced in the 
House of Representatives on 
Oct. 16 to combat e calating 
tuition at college nation-
wide. The aim of the pro-
po aI, H.R. 3311, is to hold 
college accountable for the 
increa ed expenses students 
and their families absorb as 
tuition at public and private 
universities in the United 

tates increases. This comes 
at a time when tuition has 
increa ed 3 percent over 
the last 10 years - almo t 
d uble the consumer price 
index over that same period. 

The bill would order col-
leges to explain the factOrs 
contributing to the rising 
tuition if increases are more 
than twice the rate of the 
consumer price index and 
al 0 proposes an action plan 
for how institutions can 
reduce the rates of these 
hikes. chool that fall in the 
bottom 25 percent in tuition 
costs or increase by Ie s than 

500 over a three-year peri-
od are exempt. Failure to 
comply with these mandates 
would result in federal work-
study funding withheld from 
colleges. 

According to the 
American Council on 
Education, H.R. 3311 would 
affect more than 1,400 insti-
tutions. The real effects of 
this legislation would not be 
a detriment to the institu-
tions of higher learning as 
much as they would be to 
the students who receive the 
benefits of the work-study 
programs. To bar students 
from receiving financial aid 
because of die inability to 
keep tuition co ts down is 
cowHerintuitive. 

H.R. 3311's sponsor, Rep. 
Howard P. "Buck" McKeon 
(R-CA), should be applaud-
ed, as college is becoming 
less and les affordable for 
students and their families, 
but schools will not feel the 
brunt of this bill in the same 
way that srudents will. 

White House's reaction 
to deficit disturbing 

I n light of the fact that the budget deficit 
numbers reached 

record proportions, the 
White House's cheery reac-
tion seems just a bit out of 
place. 

The federal deficit soared 
to 374.2 billion in 2003, 
which is twice 2002's $158 
billi nand ea ily surpasses 
the $290 billion record ~ et in 
1992. It's amusing at best 
and disturbing at wor r to 
note that the characteri tic 
response from Treasury 

ecretary John now is that 
"the economy is well on the 
way to recovery." 

It 's hardly urprising. 
Maybe a little too unsurpri) -
ing. Deficits are simply the 
result of lowering taxes and 
increasing military spend-
mg. There have been accu-
sations that the White 
House purp ely padded its 
deficit forecast in July to set 
the tage for a unny reac-
tion in ctcber. The acrual 
2003 deficit is $81 billion 

Ie s than the administration 
predicted, which indicates 
that they're either incompe-
tent or manipulative. 

Rather than the picrure 
getting better for next year, 
the numbers could very 
well ~et worse. Defense 
spendmg :ose. from 2002, 

althou~h Its mcrea e was 
$20 bIllion less than the 
White House estimated in 
July, largely because the 

~overnment wa spending 
1 Iraq aid more slowl~ 
than anticipated. Thats 
great for the number in 
2003, but it mean that 
many 0 the expenditures 
could very well occur in 
2004, making that year's 
deficit a contender to break 
this year's record . 

Instead of shruggIng their 
shoulders and saying, "It 
could have been worse," the 
Bush admjni tration needs 
to consider making the bud-
gt:t a key con ern, instead of 
a mes for someone else to 
clean up. 

Office hour blues 
Students should overcome 

intimidation to seek out intellect and

TIIURSDAY, ocrOBER 23, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDtAN OPINION 5 

Most professors eager for extra-curricular visits 
Students are often reluctant to reap the benefits of office hours 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

First week at UCSD is pretty tandard in most classes. Two things are certain - flucma-
tions in class population and the 
obligatory distribution of the syl-
labus. 

We're all familiar with that out-
line of the class : the rip-off 
required books, exam dates and 
percentages. ot to mention the 
time and place of the professor's 
office hours. It' safe to say that the 
latter is the item that most students 
care about least. Sure, some stu-
dents take note of office hours, but 
not with much intention of going 
to them, except right before or 
after exams. Even then, they only 
go with utter desperation. 

It is possible to get personal 
with those specks with micro-
phones in from of the lecture hall, 
al 0 known as profes ors. I don't 
know about you, but the most 
repeated piece of advice about col-
lege I've received from student and 
college life guidebooks alike is to 
go to office hours. The number of 
times I've heard professors literally 
yearn for students to come has 
accumulated to the point where it 
has become almost cliche. 

Why, oh, why, then, do so many 
professors si t in their offices, like 
people waiting for a blind date, 
expectant but unsure of anyone 
showing lip at all? If we are to con-
tinue with this analogy, when that 

person does show up, what are 
their intentions? A person on a 
blind date very likely is just looking 
for someone to satisfy his or her 
own interests. 

Likewise, perhaps many stu-
dents who do venture into the 
offices of their professors seek to 
nurture a relationship only to gar-
ner convincing recommendations 
for grad school, med school, jobs or 
what have you. I wonder if profes-
sors have any problems with this 
kind of blatant, if superficial, inten-
tion. Or are they just glad at all to 
be able to talk to someone during a 
mandated hour per week) 

Undergraduate teaching is just a 
small segment of a professors spate 
of responsibilities. One could argue 
that the rrue hean of academia is an 
unyielding committnent to research 
and publication. This demonstrates 
a number of things: First, office 
hours may just eem like something 
of a minor chore to professors (I 
could be wrong, of course). 
Secondly, the people who teach us 
are most likely somewhere between 
oUlTageously bright and merely bril-
liant, and often at the forefront of 
their fields. Therefore, it would 
mean that talking to professors 
would be of great benefit to u lowly 
students that are barely beginning to 
understand the complexities of 
learning. And thirdly, students may 
be intilnidated by the sheer brain-
power and stature of professors. 
They always did seem somewhat 
otherworldly, to me at least. 

Prior to this column, I'd only 
gone once to office hour in the two 
years and a few weeks I've been at 
UCSD. That instance was to pick up 
a midterm, and I did get into an 
interesting conver ation about the 

Bible with my professor. But mostly, 
I didn't go because I never felt th.e 
need or desire to and it seemed 
awfully intimidating. My professors 
often would advertise their office 
hours more than once and some of 
them even sounded desperate, plead-
ing for people to come to talk about 
anything - sports, movies, pets. I 
guess I started feeling bad because 
here was this awesome opportunity 
to talk to such learned individuals, to 
gain invaluable knowledge from 
people that know the material bener 

" Student~foculty relations 
seem w be relatively 
unchanging, with a 

handful taking advantage 
of the knowledge and 
resources professors 

possess ," 
than T know myself, to uncover a 
personal facet of a largely imperson-
al education - and I wasn't taking 
advantage of it. It became a sort of 
evanescent guilt; I'd glumly note the 
hours in my agenda notebook, 
knowing full well I never would go, 
but feeling somehow that making an 
extra note of it would alleviate my 
conscience. 

I finally went last week. My pro-
fessor from one of my political sci-
ence classes appealed to us more 
than once, and I heard tha t as my 
calling to take a leap of faith and go. 

ot to mention, I needed to see 

what an "office hour" really was like 
for the sake of this column. So I 
walked to Social Sciences Building 
and sITolled down to his office, all 
the while feeling like I was in line for 
a dentist's appoinonent. Perhaps it 
was because I didn't really have a 
question about the material, and 
thus no real reason to go. 
"Awkward" is the key word here. I 
awkwardly sat down and asked him 
some lame question I had prepared 
in my head on the way there about 
what news shows he watched. 

After he answered that question 
in length, there was about a five 
second awkward pause, and then 1 
launched into another question 
about his news consumption. Then 
I resorted to my fallback topic -
the midterm. Well there's an 
inquiry I'm sure tons of students 
bring to the table. Then I talked to 
him about his research, and how his 
life was as a professor. r stated that 
I was interested in a career in acad-
emia, which was a half-truth, but a 
good conversation-extender. I even 
asked him what he thought about 
office hours and his take on why 
more students didn't take advan-
tage of them. At the end of the 20 
minutes or so, I shook his hand and 
dawdled out of there as awkwardly 
as when I walked in. 

I don't necessarily advocate 
going to office hours if you have 
absolutely nothing to say; 
Professors aren't going to start ask-
ing you questions if you show up. 
However, as awkward as myexperi-
ence was, I was glad to have been 
able to see things from a professor 's 
perspective for once. As out-of-
reach as most professors seem, they 
inevitably become more human 
when you actually talk to them. 

Having a professor recognize you 
as more than a face in a crowd and 
knowing your name is actually a 
good th.ing, unless you're the type 
that skips three-fourths of your 
classes and is obnoxious during the 
ones you actually attend. In that 
case, office hours probably are the 
furthest thing from your mind. 

Smdent-faculty relations seem 
to be relatively unchanging, with a 
handful taking total advantage of 
the knowledge and resources pro-
fessors possess, another handful 
completely disregarding their pro-
fessors as anything but informa-
tion-spewing drones in frOnt of the 
classroom, and with the majority 
somewhere in between. 

Programs such as faculty mentor 
programs, in which students have 
the opportunity to act as research 
assistants to professors, can help 
bridge the gap between students and 
the Ivory Tower. Yet in most cases, it 
is entirely up to the student to deter-
mine the degree of interaction he or 
she wants to have with those brainy 
teachers. It is likely that striking up a 
conversation with a professor can 
only do good; not only for better 
recommendations but for contribut-
ing to a multi-dimenSIOnal educa-
tion that exists beyond bluebooks 
and lectures. 

Amidst the ivory towers tha t dot 
the land, it's important to realize that 
behind every complex theory, 
groundbreaking publication and 
stacks of research, there are human 
faces that truly enjoy their work and 
are available to share with others. 

They're in an office near you.

Humor publication perpetuates racial slurs 
but cultural stereotypes are serious concerns 

By DEENA AL SHAm 
Senior Staff Writer 

In the months since The Koaltr 
has put Out "Jizzlam: an entertain-
ment magazine for men," the 
UC D campus has had strong 
reaction to it, either supporting 
the paper or condemning it. 

The paper was certainly 
extremely offensive to a large seg-
ment of the UC 0 population. 
But the main problem with 
"Jizzlam" wasn't that it was offen-
sive, though that was certainly a 
large part of it. The Koaltr has been 
offensive before in their journalis-
tic que t "to put 'motherfucker' 
into print more times than any 
other newspaper in the world," as 
the description on the S.O.L.O. 
Web si te states. The problem was 
that it reinforced a negative 
stereotype during a time when 
negative stereotype are a popular 
view in the country. 

We all know that the Koaltr isn't 
trymg to promote any kind of 
underlying political agenda. 
They've insulted everyone before, 
from Mormons to Mexicans, and 
having people's feathers ruffled isn't 

going to stop them from printing -
that' the main reason they print in 
the first place. The issue with print-
ing "Jizzlam" is that many people 
aren't aware that the "jokes" they 
print are not necessarily true, What 
the KtJoItr has introduced is the need 
to clear up many of the issues that 
"Jizzlam" brought 
to light.

their body. These stereotypes have 
corne from, quite literally, ancient 
history. In the early A.D. years, 
stoning used to be the common 
punishment for people who com-
mitted adultery. While some 
extremists (such a the Taliban) 
continue to enforce this practice, it 

is not a typical 
punishment in 
anyway. One of the clas-

sic mi conceptions 
is the role of women 
in the Middle East. 
Thro ughout 
"Jizzlam," there are 
continued refer-
ences like: "Women 
can 't talk, ever" and 
'Women can never 
take off their burka 
or expose any pan

These statements encourage 
the stereotypes that all women in

and have to cover every part of

Saudi Arabia, recently the rules 
have begun to change. In Iran, it 
has almost become a fashion sta te-
ment to wear the veil , as you don't 
have to cover your hair complete-
ly. Provided the clothing isn't too 
revealing, anyone can wear just 
about anything. Wearing at-shirt

and jeans won't put anyone in dan-
ger of abuse, 

':Jizzlam" also featured a how-to 
guide for making mail bombs, as 
well as continued references 
throughout about suicide bomb-
ings, feeding the idea that all 
Middle Easterners are terrorists. 
Much of this sentiment comes from 
the media, and its coverage of 
events happening in the Middle 
East. When there is a mentioning 
of Muslims in the media, it always 
has to do with them being militant, 
radical or terrorists . When the 
Middle East is mentioned, it's 
always in the context of terrorism 
and many people don't seem to rec-
ognize that there is more to this cul-
ture than just violence. 

The fact that students in one of 
the best universities in the country 
put "Jizzlam" together is sad. But in 
the end, free speech is free speech 
and trying to change anything 
about it would cause problems all 
around. The best advice is to think 
of them as your annoying younger 
brother: the more you egg them on, 
the more they'll bother you, 
because they know they can push 
your buttons.

concernlng 
Triton Taxi 

continued from page 4 
I'd like to first point out that I 

really feel horrible that Triton 
Taxi no longer goes to the border. 
I know that this was an amazing 
part of the service that many snl-
dents took advantage of and truly 
depended on , However, there 
were certai n circumstances that 
were out of my control in regards 
to resigning the Triton Taxi con-
tract with our shuttle service, 
Cloud 9 Shuttle. 

First, Cloud 9 really gave me 
no notice that it no longer wished 
to provide shuttles to the border. 
All summer long I have been 
working on signing the contract, 
debating between two providers. 
During week zero, when it wa lit-
erally coming down to the 13 t 
minute and r had to , ign the con-
tract, Cloud 9 informed me that it 
was not goi ng to dri ve out 10 the 
border anymore. 

My contact there said there 
were a few reasons that went into 
this deci ion. One, the board of 
directors thought it was tOO milch 
of a risk factor and liability to 
drive all the way Out there, Also, 
when we have Iamited shuttle 
actually committed to Triton -iaxi 
each weekcnd and one of them is 
all the way over at TJ pickIng up a 
couple kid~, a lot of UC D stu-
dents have to walt to get back to 
campu or home, 

ow, I know most people ay I 
should just sign with another 
company, but there are more fac-
tors in choosing a company than 
I'm sure pcople realize. For exam-
ple, Yellol\' Cab of an Diego con-
racted me ro u e Its company, but 
one of the major problcms with 
Yellow Cab i that it charges 
Associated Students per mile as 
opposed to per hour like loud 9 
huttle. 

Evcn assullllng that each sru-
dent only needs a driver to drrve a 
di tance of five miles, it would stili 
come our to so much morc than 
we have allotted to the program 
(the budget for Triton Taxi is 
$12 ,000), and what Cloud 9 is 
charging. 

With a flat rate likc Cloud 9 
provide , we can estimate how 
much II will co t e<lch weekend, 
month • nd year. With Yellow 
Cab, it would be 0 hard roet a 
budget, especially In Sim ply a 
week. We would have to con Ider 
how many miles each studen t 
would need to be driven, and that 
varies so much, as does the 
amount of tudents lIsing the ser-
Vice. Cloud 9 guarantees us three 
shuttles each weekend frol11 II 
p.m. umil J a.lll . 

r know that thIS really i~ 3 trav-
esty, and lrust me, I 'm stili t:llklng 
with Cloud 9 to see what r can do. 
I can at least a sure the ulllvcr~lty 
that I will propose a much bigger 
budget for next year, ~o that we 
hopefull y get TJ back III Ihe ser-
vice. I work really hard for thi S

Focus groups were consulted by a 
marketing company to create 
menus. Weinreich, who also runs 
Canyon Vista and Earl 's Place, 
plans to base additions on customer 
feedback. 

" I want to go out there and have 
personal contact with the cus-
tomers, not suggestion boxes," 
Weinreich said. 

Cafe Ventanas also has a coffee 
bar featuring fair-trade coffee from 
Pura Vida, a company that give 
the profit back to its coffee-grow-
ing community in Costa Rica . 
Some students feci that the chOice 
sends a positive message ro UCSD. 

"Buying fair-trade coffee is a 
good start," said ERC ophomore 
Ashley Burke. "I'm glad to see that 
our campus is moving toward 
socially conscious stances." 

Be ides usual grill, sandwich 
and pizza stations, the dining com-
plex will also strive for dishes that 
are more original. However, some 
students were unimpressed by the 
fare on opening day. 

"I had a vegetable pasta di h 
that did not appeal ro my taste buds 
at all," Sixth College freshman 
Chri tina Chung said . "Even 
though Cafe Ventanas JUSt opened, 

their garlic bread was stale." 
Other students wanted to see 

more variety or authentic dishes. 
"llle food is really good so far, 

but there has not been much variety 
on the menu yet," ERC sophomore 
Adry Walsh said. "I want ro see some 
ashimi in the sushi section." 

G uerrero has many plans fo r 
Cafe Ventanas. He wants to use the 
theme meals as a continuation of 
"Global Marketplace," an ERC 
evcnt where on certain nights, stu-
dents get to try out authentic dish-
es from other countries. Guerrero 
will try ro implement the dining 
complex into ERC's emphaSis on a 
global perspective, 

"I hope they will be more 
adventurous and try for more 
authentic tastes," Guerrero said. 

Weinreich also wants to apply 
the menu to an international theme. 

"We're going to work with resi -
dent advisors and resident deans ro 
support special events," Weinreich 
sa id . "The chefs here at Cafe 
Ventanas are really comfortable 
with international themes." 

The opening of Cafe Ventanas 
relieved some of the student traffic 
from Ocean View Terrace, where 
most ERC residents previously 
went to dine. Ocean View Terrace 
manager Scott Berlin noted a pre-
dicted decrease in sales on the 
opening day o(Cafe Ventanas. 

" ure, there will be some healthy 
competition between ovr and 
Cafe Ventanas," Berlin said. "But 
we're not built for competition, but 
rather for the conununity," 

Guerrero feels that Cafe 
Ventanas finally offers a communal 
place for ERC snldents. 

"It's really nice to see people sit 
around and feel like it's theirs, and 
not feel 0 segrega ted," Guerrero 
said. 

Ward reiterated his position in 
an Ocr. I sta tement, saying his 
organization was against 
McKeon 's proposal. 

Accordin' to the ACE, which 
represents h', gher education insti-
tutions' in ' .. ~ across the

When the House Committee 
on Education and the Workforce, 
which McKeon is a member of, 
issued a repon on Sept. J ca lled 
"The College COSt Crisis ," in 
which blame was put on colleges 
and universities for unjustified 
tuition increases, the American 
Association of State Colleges and 
Un iversities also criticized his 
position, releasi ng a sta tement 
saying that a "vast majorityn of 
public institutions do not deter-
mine tuition increases. 

"Tuition increases in recent 
years have been la rger than the 
higher ed ucation community 
wished or desired," the AASU 

The response also pointed to 
other ways in which the institu-
tions were already accountable, 
such as publicly reported and 
audited finances, review by gov-
erning and coord inating boards, 
and subjec t to public review and 
publiC meeting legislati on, 

According to McKeon, a user-
fnendly Web site would be creat-
ed to permit students and parents 
to compare schools' track record 
in regard to tuition. 

"Hopefully they'd choose [Q 
take their Pel! gra n ts to the ones 
doing a good job at keeping costs 
down," McKeon said. "We want [Q 
protect the students. They aren't 
the ones that are raising the fees." 

Resolution: ORA pushes for meeting space

spiritual renaissance occurring ... a 
hunger in many that seek guid-
ance, daily practice of meditation, 
and ritual expression," said Lynn 

eu, a pastoral associate at the 
ewman Center and a volunteer at 

the Office of Religious Affairs. 
"These are the kinds of needs that 
Can be met by such a center." 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Chair Travis Silva, who authored 
the resolution in conjunction with 
students and staff members, hopes 
the resolution will send the right 
message to the campus community. 

"The goal is to show that an 
interfaith center is indeed a priority 
for the student body," Silva said, "A 
lot of people are involved with this 
- some of the religious S.O .L.O. 
orgs, individual members of the 
Office of Religious Affair, and 
many srudents on our campus." 

Neu, who calls the proposed 

building a center for ethical and 
spiritual guidance, said that original 
plans for an interfaith center were 
halted in 1989 following a question 
raised on another campus regard-
ing the constitutionality of inter-
faith centers at public universities. 

Supporters of the resolution 
hope that construction of an inter-
faith center can coincide with the 
Price Center expansion project 
that students approved in spring 
2003. 

"The construction footprjnt 
for the Price Center expansion 
has additional unfunded square 
feet of space that should be suffi-
cient for a privately funded inter-
faith center," said David Six, a 
chemistry research associate at 
UCSD and member of the 
Interfaith Center Advocacy 
Committee. 

Neu says that if construction of 
the interfaith center cannot coin-

cide with the Price Center expan-
sion, "we anticipate that it will be 
delayed fo r a number of years." 

D ebate on the council floor 
lasted less than ten minutes. 

"All the discus ions of the po -
sible center have been Fully cog-
nizant of the need to maintain the 
state-church separation and that 
any plans to proceed to develop a 
center would have to be approved 
by University General Counsel," 
said Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson. 
"Consideration of a center is the 
result of student interests and 
the desire to provide facilities and 
services on the ca mpus that 
respond to student-expressed 
interests and needs." 

Current plans call for a 17,730-
square-foot center. The $7 million 
price tag will be funded exclusiveJy

THE U 0 GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, Z003 

March: ~roposal to be heard N ov. 5 
continued from page I 

with the area's living costs. 
"We're involved because our 

members live in low- to medium-
income neighborhoods," Samaha 
said. 

Samaha described how the ordi-
nance, if passed, could help two 
families she mows who are forced 
to share a small aparttnent due to 
the high living costs in San Diego. 

Paul Karr, a representative from 
the Center on Policy Initiatives, a 
research and policy development 
center based in San Diego, explained 
that if the law passed, it would affect 
around 2,000 workers in the region. 
The campaign al 0 insists that "a liv-
ing wage ordinance in an D iego 
would have a small but positive 
impact on the local economy and on 
businesses. " 

The Center on Policy Initiatives 
is the main organiz.ation behind the 
living wage campaign in San Diego. 

Supporters of the ordinance 
point to some 110 already estab-
lished living wage la'Ys situated 
throughout the U nited States, 
including the cities and institutions 
of San Jose, Calif.; Baltimore, Md.; 
and Harvard University. A study of 
the effects of the living wage in 
Baltimore conducted by Johns 
Hoplcins University researchers in 
1999 concluded that "the living 
wage ordinance has had positive 
effects on a relatively small number 
of workers in Baltimore without 
significant financiaJ cost to the city 
... the evidence suggests that high-
er wages and hours improve the 

stability and reliability of the work-
force." In addition, supporters of 
the ordinance maintain that the 
living wage law would benefit busi-
nesses as well as their employees. 

Karr explained that an essen-
tial goal of the ordinance is not 
only to aid underpaid families, 
but also to ensure the responsible 
use of tax dollars. While the city 
government and local businesses 
would have to foot the bill for the 
wage increases, ca mpaign sup-
porters argue that these extra 
costs would be offset by increased 
productivi ty and decreased 
reliance on public assistance pro-
grams such as food stamp and 
Medi-Cal. 

Living wage organizations 
claim that a period of economic 
downturn is the best time to enact 
such a policy. 

Christina Ruiz-Goldberg, a 
San Diego tate University stu-
dent and member of Students for 
Economic Justice, explained that 
because San Diego is one of the 
largest and most expensive cities 
in California, the living wage law 
should be passed. As one of the 
organizers of the Oct. 21 march, 
Rui z-Goldberg described her 
hope that the rally at City Hall 
would "let [city council members] 
mow students care about a living 
wage." 

Although the living wage ordi-
nance would only affect workers 
employed by businesses subsidized 
or financially supported by the 
City of San Diego, student organi -

zations like the Ca liforni a 
Coalition Against Poverty at San 
Diego City College and Just Cause 
at University of San Diego hope 
that San Diego students will also 
benefit from the ordinance . 
Pointing to the highly successful 
campaign at Harvard University in 
2001 , supporters hope that the law 
will help combat recent tuition 
hikes at UCSD, SDSU and San 
Diego City College. 

Karr likewise described his 
optimism in gaining support from 
the majority of city counci l mem-
bers, but had reservations about 
support from Mayor Dick Murphy. 
He explained tha t most of the 
opposition faced by the campaign 
has come from "conservative busi-
ness leaders who want to increase 
their profit margins." 

Endorsed by numerous faith-
based, community, labor and stu-
dent organizations and individuals, 
including Lt. Gov. Cruz 
Bustamante, California Coalition 
Against Poverty and several UCSD 
professors, the campaig n will 
attempt to aid struggling families 
and individual unable to support 
themselves. 

The campaign hopes to have 
the living wage ordinance enacted 
by spring of 2004, bur the next step 
for supporters will be getting the 
vote of the City Council Rules 
Committee on ov. 5 before a vote 
by the committee. The ordinance 
must be pa sed by the Rules 
Committee in order to be reviewed 
by the full city council. 

Interfaith: Private donations to fund center 
contmued from page 7 

through private donations and not 
with student fees or state funds. 

The push for an interfaith cen-
ter is not unique to UCSD. UC 
Irvine, UCLA and Cal State 

orthridge have interfaith centers, 
as nine other universities through-
out the country, according to Neu. 

The resolution tates that the 
center would bring people of differ-
ent religions together and "increase 
their interaction and cooperation, 
leading to increased trust and sup-
port between those students. n 

The resolution comes on the 
heels of tension brought about by 
the distribution of controversy 

an engineer in 

over the Oct. 14 distribution ofTht 
Koalil's uJizzlam" issue, which was 
first distributed in June 2003. 

The text of the resolution draws 
upon the UCSD Principles of 
Community, which affirm the right 
to freed m of expression "within 
the bounds of courtesy, sensitivity, 
confidentiality and respect."

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2003 THE UCSf) GUARDIAN 9 

DIVERSITY, AIRPLAY 
The 2003 San Diego Music Awards, held at Humphrey's by the Bay, began not with a bang but with a puff of pink, fluffy smoke. 

The Troys, newly anointed into the realm of 
major label status, showed plenty of enthusiasm 
and confidence, but it was all for naught. Sisters 
Lindsey and Anna T roy sang their little hearts 
out, gyrating onstage in glammed-up schoolgirl 
oum ts, but they were smothered by banal pop-
rock arrangements (you can partially blame Avril 
Lavigne's songwriting partners The Matrix for 
that) and a generic, overproduced sound. 

What to expect after such an underwhelming 
o pening? The SDMAs vacillated between inspi-
ration and insipidity throughout, both in per-
formance and in presentation. T he bad: terribly 
scripted and unfunny introductions by presen-
ters. The good: some excellent performances, 
rightly-given awards and elementary schools 
benefiting from donated Taylor brand guitars. 

Following the Britney-with-a-band sound of 
the Troys was three-award nominee (and sadly, 
three-award loser) /Jya, one of San Diego's most 
celebrated groups. /Jya proved its acclaim is com-
pletely deserved as it delivered the shows finest 
performance, combining the cool trip-hop atmos-
pherics of Portishead with occasional noise out-
bursts and almost spoken-word vocals. 
Frontwoman Blanca Rojas danced like she was 
swatting flies (totally in a good way) and seduced 
the audience with her sultry croon, prompting ca-
host lim Pyles to proclaim, ''I've never wanted to 
be a microphone more in my life!" 

Up-and-coming Christian rockers 
Switchfoot won both Best Album and Best Pop 
Album for their 2003 release The Beautiful 
Letdown. Their recent success has proven the 
continued commercial viability of music with 
firm roots in Christianity, and the band happily 
accepted the awards. 

Jason Mraz won both Best Song and Best 
Artist. The trucker hat-dad singer failed to make 
the awards show, understandably so as he is cur-
rently making waves on the national scene. The 
twO big winners of the night were both artiSts 
with national exposure and radio and video air-
play, begging the questions: What exactly did they 
win for? Helping to keep San Diego on the musi-
cal map, or creating great music? 

Tenor saxophonist Joe Marillo gave a stirring 
performance, living up to his title as the 
"Godfather of San Diego Juz." The longtime 
pe.rformer and teacher was given the Lifetime 
Achievement Award for his various contributions 
to the San Diego jazz scene, including coUabora-
tions with Dizzy Gillespie, Art Pepper and Sonny 
Rollins. The audience greeted both the award and 

Travis Ball/Guardian 
aockwise from top: Ilya, Steve Poltz, The Accident Experiment, The Trays performed at the SOMAs. 
Marilla's performance with due enthusiasm. 

Longtime San Diego favorite Mojo Nixon 
hammed it up with his strange and confronta-
tional country rock. Drunkenly singing lines 
lilce "where the fuck are the goddamn nuclear 
weapons?" to his acoustic guitar and an accom-
panying electric guitarist, Mojo Nixon's unique 
personality bore well with an audience in need 
of a good laugh. They certainly weren 't getting 
it from co-host Troy Johnson. Sample joke: 
"The award goes to: Troy Johnson - My Life 
on Prozac." Ouch. 

" What exactly did they win far? 
Helping to keep San Diego an the 

musical map, ar creating great 
. 7" musLC. 

Best New Artist winners and nu-metal 
wsupergroup" The Accident Experiment (ex-
members of San Diego bands P.O .D . and 
Sprung Monkey) proved to be more bad acci -
dent than compelling experiment (bad pun 
alert l) . The sound of sludgy Korn guitars and 
angry-guy singing did help to form a siz.able 
crowd in front of the Humphrey's stage, and 
they got into a bit of a groove in the second 
song, howing off their Pink Floyd influence. To 
be fair, they lITt a new band. Next time, guys, 
you need to "experiment" more ( orry). 

Best Blues nominee (and frequent SDMA 
performer) Earl Thomas gave a soulful perfor-
mance with gospel singers the Jezebels. 
Despite losing the award to the Bill ,\ltagee 
Blues Band, Thomas and the Jezebels sang 
with feeling and precision. Best Acoustic win-
ner Steve Poltz and Best Pop winner A.J . 
Croce performed together at the show's end, 
performing a duet on songs they recently co-
wrote. The songs were likeable but slightly 
forgettable, failing to show off the talents of 
either si nger-songwriter. However, their mer-
its suggest that future collaborarion should be 
worth noting. 

Rocko/a won Best Cover Band, and the 
band will be performing the entire White 
Album by The Beatles at Spreckels Theatre on 
Oct. 31. Best Alternative went to Hot Like a 
Robot, who barely made it to the stage, and 
Best Punk and Best Punk Album went to gent 
51, who took the opportunity to thank fellow 
nominees The Classified, who they deemed 
more deserving (and who didn't have a current 
91X hit) . 

Other notable winners include: No Knife's 
Riot for RO'1IIIl1Ict for Best Alternative Album; 
Nickel Creek's This Side for Best Americana 
Album; a.m. Vibe's self-titled album for Best 
LocaJ Recording; B-Side Players for Best World 
Music; and The Album Leaffor Best Electronic.

Hailed by ritics as one of the best dele-gdlcs of a subca tegory m own as Stoner rock, Queen f the Stone ge has

The Distillers are the ultimate proof that there i another world of punk, different from the mesh trucker hat- wearing

'Beyond Borders' beyond dull 
Overload of symbolism and unrealistic plot ruin film 

By 'ESSICA KIUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

While it is probably unpopular to slam a film about humanitarian relief efforts, the sub-par quality of "Beyond 
Borders" malces it easier on the conscience to 
do just that. 

Touted as an epic love story set in sweep-
ing landscapes and harsh realities, the film is 
truly visually stunning. The political message 
is glaringly obvious: There is and has been a 
dire need for relief efforts in the world. The 
political platform "Beyond Borders· has to 
grapple with, however, is its ultimate demise. 

The issue of aid to war-tom countries is 
like a baseball bat to the legs of this film, and 
the result is a wholly underdeveloped script, 
incomplete characters and a general feeling 
of emptiness. 

Sarah Jordan, played by Angelina Jolie, is 
a transplanted American living in London 
with her British white-collar husband, and 
together they form the perfect philanthropic 
socialite couple. In fact, Jordan is in atten-
dance at a hoity-toity benefit ball to raise 
money for the starving in Africa when she 
learns that charity is not all glitz, glam and 
S2,OOO-per-plate dinners. 

Her eyes are opened about the same time 
she is knocked to the floor by the chaotic, 
unplanned arrival of Dr. Nick Callahan 
(Clive Owen), who bursts into the event with 
a starVing child and hordes of press in tow. 
He wastes no time in metaphorically spitting 
in the diners' high-end plates. The funding 
for his relief camp in Ethiopia has been axed, 
and this renegade doctor wants it bade. 

By the next morning, Jordan cubes in her 
savings for thousands of dollars worth of 
beans, paclcs up for a trip to Ethiopia, and 
leaves the hubby in their posh London apart-
ment. 

And that's just the first 10 minutes. 
"Beyond Borders· is essentially divided 

into three locations across nearly IS years 
and has three tiers of character and story 
development. The characters fail to expand, 
however, because in each location, th.e script 
is bogged down in explanation of what hap-
pened in the previous five years, why the 
heck Jordan is in Cambodia, and who is hav-
ing romantic relations with whom. 

The strongest element of the film is the 
scenery and cinematography. "Beyond 
Borders" filmed as closely as it could get to 

~ Film ~ --RE-VIE-W 
the script and the crew globe-trotted to 
northern Africa and Thailand. The dust is 
real, the flies are real, and it works for the 
film. 

There are some things, however, that 
seem so very unreal. 

Symbolism is a fine tool when done right. 
White is a symbolic color, signaling inno-
cence and niavete. It is unreal, however, to 
dressJolie head-to-toe in white in the deserts 
of Africa. White espadrilles and a designer 
fedora could be symbolic - yes - but are 
downright cheesy. 

Later in the movie,Jordan is clad in black. 
Ironically, she's in black while running 
through the snowy mountains of Chechnya, 
where the white could have se.rved her well as 
camouflage. Furthermore, while shes there, 
Jordan spends a stack of five-dollar bills and 
45 seconds to find a person who has been 
captured and hidden somewhere in the 
frozen war wne. Believable? Hardly. 

Jolie does, however, manage to play the 
part with a sense of urgency, which undoubt-
edly comes from her true-life experiences 
with the United Nations High Commission 
for Refugees as Goodwill Ambassador. The 
abbreviated script choked her of any true 
character development: she did what she 
could, but ultimately, Jordan was too empty 
to identify with. 

Owen, as CaUahan, is overly passionate 
and a mystery beyond his ardent efforts. 
Cursing and sweating, he is an unreachable, 
impenetrable humanitarian who has put his 
own life on hold to focus on the needs of oth-
ers. Although at times his cursing was laugh-
able, he was griny enough for the part. LiKe 
Jolie, Owen did what he could. But not even 
these two talented actors could save this trav-
esty of a film .

album reviews 

Saves the Day manages to salvage their major label debut, In Reverie, 
with a polished, upbeat, 
pop-punk sound. But, the 
band nearly fritters away the 
progression they've made 
over their past five albums 
with vocals that make it

blood on the cover of Coral 
Fong, clues the listener that 
it's going to be a bumpy 
ride. Luckily, Brody Daile 
(recently divorced from 
Rancid/Transplants front-
man Tim Armstrong) and 
her band the Distillers have 
a knack for combining their 
pain with energy, attitude 
and thoughtful composi-
tions . 

With pounding drum and a chip on Francis Healy's shoulder, the 
boys of Travis are bacle with 
a new album and a new atti-
tude about life and politics. 
Healy'S lyrics take on topics 
uch as war and jealousy and 

place them into II songs of 
musical exploration and pas-
sion. 

tempting to fast- forward the 
middle (singing section) of 
each track. Vocalist Chris 
Connelly overuses and abus-

what could be above-par 
instrumentals.

a complete loss. The duration

Comedy of Errors a play of 
excellent comic timing 

Chemistry between the cast helps 
make this production a success 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Hiatus Editor 

Whoever said Shakespeare wa boring needs to be shot, or at the very least taken to the 
Aquila Theatre Company's produc-
tion of "Comedy of Errors." T his 
updateu performance of The Bard' 
fir t comedy is currently playmg at 
La Jolla Playhouse to TlOtou 
laughter. 

Shakespeare's earliest and most 
access I ble comedy tells the Story of 
twO sets of twin - two young men 
and their servants - who are tragi-
cally separated (a familiar theme for 

hakespeare) and then find them-
selves in hilarious situa tions of mi -
taken identi ties, evenrual ly reuniting 
in a contrived, yet ultimately pleas-
ing ending. 

The Aquila Theatre Company, 
which ha gained a reputation for 
excellent clas ical theater produc-
c ons, gives new life to the sill iest o f 

hakespeare's comedies by addmg an 
element of cartoornsh humor and 
placing the story in 193 Os Turkey. 
Everythi ng from passing gas to 
human anatomy becomes the topic 
of jokes - and successful ones. And 
what could have made this goofy 
comedy even better? Song and 
dance, of course! Musical numbers, 
choreographed dance rou tines (both 
romanoc and comical), humorous 
chase sequence and figh ts are all set 
to music, and make "C omedy of 
Errors" a fast-paced frolic in this 
bright and vibrant world. 

Theater 
REVIEW 

Even the silliest of jokes are 
pulled off with perfection by a cast 
\\~rn bri lliant comedic timing and 
plendld chemistry. LOUI S Bute ll i 

absolutely steal the sh ow with h i 
enrnu 13 ac portrayal of the con-
fu cd and often downtrodden 
Dronlio of yracuse and his twin 
Dromio of Ephesus. As these two 
characters, Butelli goes from being 
uptight and dorky to clever and 
street-smart within seconds, all with-
out a cosrume change. Part genius 
and part child, Butelli uses his talents 
to make the performance furt. 

Along with Butellj~ commend-
able performance is that of Richard 
Willi. With nearly the same amount 
of fervor, Willis brings life to the 
philandering man 's man Antipholus 
of Ephesus, as well as the straight-
laced and four-eyed Antipholus of 
Syracuse. (The reason for each pair 
of twins sharing the same name is 
still a mystery.) His dreamy dancing 
as Antipholus of Syracuse contrasts 
with his parrying and thrusong 
movements as Antipholus o f 
Ephesus, showcasing his amazing 
abili ty to play twO completely differ-
ent characters (with different accents 
and all) that look exacrly the arne.

'Sylvia' fails to pay tribute to poet 
Film focuses on her love life rather than achievements 

By ANN SHEN 
Contributing Writer 

There is always a stigma when adapting a historical figure's life to film, a precarious bal-
ance that deterrrunes if the film is a 
hit or a miss. "Sylvia" is a miss. 

Directed by New Zealand film-
maker Christine Jeffs, "Sylvia" is an 
ineffective examination of the last 
decade of American writer Sylvia 
Plath's life. Partially adapted from 
Birthday Letters by Ted Hughes 
(plath's late husband, played by 
D arnel Craig), the film paints a 
superficial portrait of Plath and 
Hughes' relationship. M ost know 
very little of the depressed poet's 
life. At the mo t, they know the dis-
turbing faCt that she committed 
suicide by sticking her head in her 
kitchen oven. "Sylvia" adds little 
more to the legend. 

The hype around Gwyneth 
Paltrow as Plath seems to explain 
the lack of focus on the script 
Paltrow plays a devastatingly lovely 
but tortured Plath, but even she 
cannot pull the weight of the poor-
ly constructed storyline. 

The film begins when Plath 
meets Hughes, a charismatic poet 
at the beginning of his career. 
Paltrow and Craig'S distinctly 
haunting chemistry quickly dis-
solves in the lackluster plot. Too 
much of Plath's life story is told 
through obvious dialogues in an 
attempt to bridge the gap between 
Plath-before-Hughes and Plath-
after-Hughes. This rushed story-
telling in effect destroys a potential-
ly beautiful film. 

The underdeveloped baclcstory 
of Plath becomes the Achilles heel 
of the film . There is nothing

author Sylvia Plath from succumbing to the typical Hollywood love story. 

Film 
REVIEW 

engaging a bout the character to 
give a tender balance to the arro-
gant and self-indulgent loudmouth 
she becomes with Hughes. In faCt, 
Plath the poet spends very little 
time writing in the film and too 
much time rocking hersel f back and 
forth, baking uneaten goods and 
neglecting her chi.idren. Hughes' 
character is altogether ignored. He 
has no motives for his actions, 
which further confuses his influ-
ence on Plath's depression. 

"Sylvia" is redeemed slightly 
with gorgeous art direction loaded 
with scenes of muddy fields in 
England, turquoise glass oceans in 
New England, and dark, dingy 
homes. A visit to America and 

Plath's cozy, cheery childhood 
home provides a stark contrast to 
the cold, dim home Hughes creates 
for them in England. The contrast 
between Plath's youth and marriage 
is more blatant through art direc-
tion than through narrative. Scenes 
are heavi.iy laden with symbolism 
and the costumes are carefully cho-
sen to set the mood. 

While the film has attempts at 
subtle art direction and an Oscar-
winning leading actre s, it is com-
pletely unforgivable to have a 
tedious narrative that hardly pays 
tribute to the legendary writer.

Comedy: 
Cast comes 
through in 

fabulous sty Ie 
cominued from page 12 

superb job of portraying multiple 
characters with inter related stories 
and, as a whole, complement 
Butelli and Willis wonderfully. 
Alex Webb, in roles a Egeon the 
father, Balthasar the Merchant and 
Pinch the doctor, is humorous with 
his exaggerated gestures. Andrew 
Shwartl. is animated and entertain-
ing several characters, especia ll y as 
Angelo the goldsmith who seems 
to run around like a chicken with 
its head cut off. The three actress-
es (Lisa Carrer, Lindsay Raye 
laylor and Heather Murdock) play 
off each other nicely, although 
Murdock disp layed the most 
enthusiasm and talent while 
switching back and forth from a 
swarrhy kitchen maid to a svelte 
courtesan . 

Within the simplistic stage ct-
rings and amusing lighting, the 
action becomes the main focus . 
Unlike other modern versions of 

hakespearean plays that end up 
being odd and confusing, this one 
works, making for a pleasant end-

winner getting a date courtesy of 
local restaurants and obliging ath-
letes. 

Julian Nahan of the cross-
country team netted $50, perhaps 
in part due to his (successful) 
cowboy getup. Nahan took a 
somewhat philosophical stance 
regarding the evening'S events, 
saying that he went into the auc-
tion "wanting to h~ve fun with it, 
and not to take it too seriously. If 
I took the meat market aspect too 
seriously, it would have been dif-
ferent. " 

The vast majority of partici-
pants found themselves shirtless 
as an inducement to raise the 
bids. Many were reduced to 
Speedos as part of the bargaining 
process and there was plenty of 
muscle flexing and strutting to be 
had by all. 

Ironically, amidst the flurry of 
strutting and stri pping, two of the 
participants who grossed the most 
funds were those who took the 
stage conservatively. Adam 
Torren of the UCSD men's vol-
leyball team was eventually pur-
chased for $85 , and was one of the 
few who wasn't reduced to his 
boxers. 

"I was just hoping to make $5 
above the minimum," confessed 
Torren, a Pike brother who was 
motivated to participate out of a 
desire to help the athletics depart-
ment. "I'm a pretty shy guy," the 
volleyball star said, "but the 
money is going to the right 
place." 

Event organiz.ers estimated 
that over $1 ,000 had been raised 
over the course of the evening, no 
small part of which was due to the 
athlete who rai ed the most 
money, water polo's Colin 
McElroy. 

At the start of the evening, I 
asked my friend whom she 
thought would be the highest bid. 
Her guess turned out to be cor-
rect, as McElroy eventually sold 
for $115, thanks to a three-way 
bidding war that resulted in more 
things lost than a chance for a 
date. 

It started out innocently 
enough, with McElroy insisting 
that someone in the audience 
would have to be willing to fork 
over $85 before he'd be willing to 
fork over hiS clothes , The bid was 
made, and the clothe came off. 
Just a mere three lap dances and 
$30 later, McElroy had lost some 
dignity but gamed quite a bit of 
money fo r the cau~e of ports and 
rcerea tlon. 

" pt.ftlng and >trange" were 
the word~ that McElroy u<ed to 
deSCribe the e\'ent " It was unex-
pected, but altogether appreciat-
cd," he S3Jd. 

I'm )u re a lut of audience mem-
bers would agree. 

T he master of ceremomes was 
Amon DJn(liI , a Pike brother who 
took on the duoe of introducing 
participants and calling out the 
bid . "It went well," Dindll said . 
"The athletes really came through , 
and I think the girls had a good 
time." 

Mayb I wanted to ee men 
exually ob)e tlfted for a change.:. 

Maybe I wondered about the kind 
of people who would how up at 
an event IiI. that. Maybe I was 
ju t curiou . But by the end of th 
night, I have to conre that I had 
a pretty good time. It was pretty 
funny to e ucces ful athletes 
reduced to saleable items, and 
funnier to hear the eager erie of 
college women screaming, Yult, it 
o/J'." 

I'm not sure It' what I expect· 
ed, but it ccnalllly wa cmenalll -

defense that needs to step it up for the 
[California Collegiate Athletic Association 
playoffs)." 

UCSD head coach Derek Armstrong 
agreed with Shum's thoughts on the game. 

"It could have been three of four, easily. 
We hit the post twice," he said, referring to 
the number of goals UCSD could have 
scored. "We've got good stuff, but we're a 
little too open defensively." 

With UCSD dominating play for the 
remainder of the game, Chapman had no 
chance to tie the score. All of their coun-
terattacks were quickly stopped, and the 
offense again resumed peppering the 
Chapman goal. 

Nishio's goal in the fifth minute held up 
while goalie Cookson recorded the 
shutout. It was UCSD's fourth straight win 
heading into the close of the season. 
UCSD will play their final road match 
against Cal State San Bernardino on Oct. 
25 , 

He is an integral part of its defensive unit, 
according to the team. 

"It's a tough time of the year [to lose 
Blair]," Armstrong said. "We 've been 
injury-free all year long." 

The injury came only two games before 
postseason playoffs begin. 

Shum spoke of Blair's presence on the 
field . 

"Speed is his asset. He is the best mark-
ing defensernan on our team," Shurn said. 

Should the need to fill Blair's spot for 
future games arise, the team will be ready. 

"We're going to step it up with the boys 
tomorrow," Armstrong said. 

Shum also described the depth of the 
team, defensively. 

"The team can step it up, and the guys 
are doing well in training," he said. 

More important than the win for the 
team will be the recovery of Blair, the team 
leader and one of the team's best defenders. 

As the Tritons prepare for their playoff 
run, they hope Blair will be back in the 
lineup and playing at 100 percent, espe-
cially Armstrong, who hopes to have his 
co-captain back on the field as soon as pos-
sible. 

"Keep your fingers crossed," Armstrong 
said.

said. "Whether I play or not doesn't 
really matter that much to me." 

Armstrong expects him to con-
tinue to be a large factor in the 
team's success for years to come, as 
do many of his teammates. 

"1 expect him to play and start 
all four years," Armstrong said. 

The team has two more games

Regardless of how the team 
fares for the rest of its schedule, 
Maurer has proven himself on the 
field with his remarkable play. 
Armstrong acknowledged the 
tremendous impression ' that 
Maurer has made. 

"He's had a heck of a good sea-
son, a heck of a good season!" he 
sajd. 

Even teammates recognize the 
unbelievable season that Maurer 
has put together. Blair didn't mind 

making a prediction of his own 
about the freshman. 

"He'IJ probably be the fresh -
man of the year in the conference, 
no doubt about it," Blair said. 

Most importantly, Maurer 
loves to play the game. He has a 
good time on the field, and he 
enjoys aIJ aspects of the game, 
from the glory of scoring goals to 
the monotony of running. 

"I like that there's lots of run-
ning, and I like to score a lot," 
Maurer sajd. "It's a lot of work, but 
it's fun ."

COMMENTARY 

Athlete

turns into 
strip show 
Females engage 
in bidding war 
at Porter 's Pub 

By JESSICA UNGEL 
Senior Staff Writer 

If I hadn 't been there, I never 
would have believed it. The first 
annual UCSD male athlete auction 
took place on Oct. 20 at Porter's 
Pub, sponsored by the Pi Kappa 
Alpha fraternity. All proceeds were 
donated to the UCSD athletic 
department, but all bets were off 
when it came to outrageous behav-
ior on behalf of the boys up for 
sale. 

I suppose I should have been 
shocked and appalled - after all, 
if the same antics had been 
attempted in a women's auction, 
the cries of outrage would have 
been loud and constant. 
Accusations of objectification 
would have femi nists up in arms. 
But I couldn't help getting a kick 
out of the auction, from the ath-
letes' ploys to increase their bids 
to the audience's insistence on the 
removal of clothing. 

Athletes were auctioned off 
singly, in pairs and in triplets. 
Bidding started at $20, with the

That could 
have been 

you at 
Wrigley Field 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

H ave you ever had a Steve Bartman moment? Has there ever been a time in 
your life where, in an instant, 
you've done something so stupid 
and embarrassing that only 
moments later the entire scene 
seems urreal? Did that moment 
ruin your life? 

You weren't sitting down the 
left field line at Wrigley Field for 
game six of the • ational League 
C hampionship eries between the 
Cubs and the Marlins. You could-
n't get seats. But if you could have, 
that might have been you staring 
up into the Chicago night as that 
baseball soared magically toward 
your outstretched arms. That 
might have been you that scram-
bled to recover that once-in-a-
lifetime souvenir after it gla nced 
off of your hands. That might 
have been Steve Bartman scream-
ing at his TV as the cameras 
zoomed in on your face and 
MOise Alou yelled in your direc-
tion. You just cost the Cubs a trip 
to the World Series. 

Bartman 's ill-fa ted attempt to 
catch that foul ball interfered with 
Alou and helped continue the 
eighth innmg in which the 
Marlins overcame a 3-0 deficit 
with eight runs and turned the 
tide in the series. History will 
undoubtedly forget Alex 
Gonzalez's key error in the inning 
and the way that Dusty Baker 
once again proved his ineptitude 
in the playoffs, but history will 
remember Bartman. 

The same kind of mental break-
down that let the ball squirt 
between Bill Buckner's legs in the 
1986 World eries, or kept Cedric 
Wilson running while the clock 
expired in the 4gers vs. Rams game 
earlier this season , will forever be 
the stigma attached to the name 
Steve Bartman. His name and 
addres have been broadcast in the 
media, Ius friends and neighbors 
have been terrorized, and hiS 
prospects of ever liVing a peaceful 
life m Chicago have been hattered. 

I've had a Bartman moment or 
twO m my life. I've rTlJssed a wlde-
open goal eight feet wide to the 
left, I've said some rather idiotic 
things, and I've run into my fair 
share of poles ... but never on 
national television. evcr with the 
world watching. 

Maybe for you it's the bacle 
page of a test you left blank, the 
oda you spilled all over yourself 

in ftont of your friends, or maybe 
It's the thing you said about the 
person who ended up being right 
behind you. Whatever it I you've 
don or have yet to do, you'll 
never live up to the original 
Bartman moment. 

Con Ider yourself lucky. That 
could have been you, but) hope It 
never is . May aU of your days be 
free of Bartman moments, and may 
all of your eats be in the «ond 
row.

Men's soccer blanks Chapman University 
UCSD co-captain Blair leaves game with injury 

By mPHEN VONDERACH 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
won its second game in three days 
on Oct. 20, holding off Chapman 
University for a 1-0 non-confer-
ence victory and improving to 10-
3 -\. The victory was the least of 
the team's concerns, however, as 
senior defender Ryan Blair left 
midway through the second half 
with a severe lower leg injury. His 
status is yet to be determined. 

The team got off to a quick 
stan when, five minutes into the 
game, sophomore midfielder 
Grant ishio grabbed the ball 
near midfield and took off down 
the ideline. He Cut into 
Chapman's goal box and beat the 
goalie for an early 1-0 lead. The 
goal would prove to be the game 
winner. 

Chapman had the only other 
good scoring opportunity of the 
first half, as a shot from just out-
ide the box eluded senior goal-

keeper Jeremy Cookson and hit 
the top corner of the crossbar. 

Midway through the second 
half, Blair challenged for the ball 
and went down with a lower leg 
injury. The game was delayed for 

several minutes before he was 
taken off the field on a can, and it 
seemed as though the team was 
shaken by the injury of one of its 
co-captains. 

"[Blair) is inspirational and 
always upbeat," said senior 
defender and co-captain Jon 
Shum. "It was a little bit of a let-
down. We were worried about 
Blair." 

Immediately after play 
resumed, Chapman appeared to 
score a goal, but it was called back 
by a contoversial offside call. This 
lucky break sparked the UCSD 
offense, which denied Chapman 
any chance of coming back in the 
game. 

The offense exploded for con-
tinuous opportuni ties, as the 
Tritons controlled play through-
out the last 25 minutes. There 
were several quality scoring 
chances, many of which were 
inside Chapman's goal box, along 
with two shots that went off the 
goalposts. 

"We have some explosive for-
wards and we put some pressure 
on them," Shum said. wit's the

improved 10-3-1 overall after 
their 1-0 non-conference victory

overtime. He leads the team in 
game-winning goals and is also the 
second leading scorer on the team.

little trouble adjusting to colle-
giate athletics.

role would be at the start of the 
season, but he quickly settled into 
a groove.

tarring," Maurer said. "But it's 

good to be out there. I'm excited 
about being on top of my game."
