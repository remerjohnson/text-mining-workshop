Modifications Made 
lOFIV8-VearPianon 
Affinnative Action 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Stall Wrlt8r 

A committee has modified UCSO's Five-Year Stu-
dent Affinnative Action Plan 10 include an increase in 
the number of transfer students from commWlity col-
leges among its goals, and to allow the A.S. and the 
Graduate Student Association (GSA) to become in-
volved in student Affinnative Action. 'The modifica-
tions follow the submission of proposed amendments 
10 the plan by AS. President Jolm Edson. 

The proposed amendments have also led 10 efforts 
to draft a separate nwter plan for disabled students in 
order to create guidelines for disabled student pr0-
grams as well as campus and building access . 

The Five-YearAffmnative Action Plan outlines the 
goals and strategies ofUCSO from 1989 through 1994 
in the enrollment and retention of those groups consid-
em:l to be discriminated against or underrepresented. 
1be plan succeeds the fmt five-year plan, which 
targeted the period from 1984 to 1989 . 

According to Vice Olancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs Joseph Watson, chairman of the Student Affir-
mative Action Plan Update Conunittee which drew up 
the plln, the modifications require a"strongereffort for 
community college transfers." 

Watson said outreach 10 community college stu-
dents was "assumed" in the original version of the plan, 
but it has now been "made it explicit in the plan." 

Funher additions to the plan acknowledge the .. ~ 
teotiIl role" oflbe A.S. and GSA in Affinnative Action 
programs. WabiOO said. 

"I feel the AS. and the GSA can playa major role 
in Affinnative Action and should be mentioned," he 
added. 

Edson explained that the plan now "makes the 
[A.S.] an equal player in the plan and gives us a role in 
examining CUJTent plans to see how they are inad-
equate." 

One possibility for A.S. involvement suggested by 
Edson's proposed amendments is the development of 
a "retention fee," similar 10 that of UCLA, whose 
students pay $2 a quarter to support retention pro-
grams. 

But Watson said that specific examples of the

TG With Beer Clears First Hurdle 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Staff Writer 

The outcome ofa meeting on Friday between 
A.S. President John Edson and UCSO Fire 
Marshal Cluck Stone has increased the likeli-
hood that free beer will be served at an experi-
mental TG on Feb. 22. 

According to Edson, "the meeting went 
better than I expected. " The fire marshal sup-
ported all arrangements for the experimental 
TG at the Price Center. 

Stone agreed that the zigzag wheelchair 
ramp into the Price Center plaza could be 
blocked off, reducing the number of paid secu-
rity officers required. 

In addition, Stone decided that the doors to 
the ballroom could be taped off, thus preventing 
people from taking beer inside. 

Stone's decisions on the experimental plan 
will help reduce the price of the TG. Edson 
cited the high cost of security for a "closed"TG 
as a major obstacle to future TGs. 

UCSO Police Chief John Anderson has 
recommended a total of 18 on-site Staff Pro 
security personnel for a secured TG. 

"The level of security [recommended by 
Anderson] would be so cost-prohibitive that 
the event would have to be killed," Edson 
said. 

The A.S. cannot legally serve alcohol at an 
event where the public can mix with UCSO 
students and employees because it is a student 
organization. 

Edson said cost and other issues will be 
discussed at the final TG committee meeting 
this Thursday. The meeting will not be open 
to the public. 

According to Edson, there are also prob-
lems with the use of sound equipment at the 
TG because the event will start at 6 p.m. 

Because of the late starting time, there may 
be difficulties in the transfer of equipment to 
the Triton Pub, which will use the same 
equipment later that evening.

• Division II move, Gulf War also discussed 
By Jason Snell 
News Editor 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
warned that the statewide budget crisis 
could drive the University of Califor-
nia "out of business" at an A.S.-
sponsored Chancellor's Forum on Fri-
day. 

Though Atkinson and Vice Chan-
cellor of Undergraduate Affairs Jo-
seph Watson also discussed such is-
sues as a possible move to NCAA 
Division n athletics and the war in the 
Persian Gulf, a major part of the forum 
dealt with the budget crisis. 

While he ernphMized that it is "too 
early to know specific details" about 
the effects of the budget crunch, 
Atkinson did explain that the depth of 
the state's fuwlcial difficulties will 
decide the future of the university. 

"If this budget is a one-year prob-
lem, we'll live duough it," he said. "If 
it's for two, three,orfouryears, we'U 
be out of business. We won't be able 10 
attract the quality people thai we are 
now able to attract. The University of 
California will be like the California 
State University." 

Even if the state's budget shortfall is 
only temporary, Atkinson suggested 
that the educational quality of the uni-
versity "is going to go down." 

"One year is livable," he said. "But 
more than one year, and it will start 
eating into the core of the institution." 

Atkinson used recent library cuts to 
illustrate the problems caused by the 
decreased state budget. He said that 
while the cost of journals and periodi-
cals at the University Library has in-
creased by 25 percent, the library bud-
get will be slashed dramatically. 

"It's very unfortunate in the long 
haul," Atkinson said. "There are jour-
nals we've had for 20 years that will 
just cease 10 exist [beyond this year]." 

When a student in the audience 
suggested that money given to UCSO 
as research grants could be tied to 
funding for undergraduate needs, 
Atkinson responded that emphasizing 
undergraduate education above all else 
would be the wrong path to take. 

"The university is here for a lot of 
reasons, and undergraduates are one of 
those reasons," he said. "We can 'tclose

PLAN 
Cont?nued from ~ 1 
implementatioo of either outreach 
to commwtity college students or 
involvementofstudent govenunent 
in AffinnativeAction were!l()( staled 
in the plan. 

"Since there has not been broad 
discussion [oftbe modifications] it 
would be inappropriate to include 
specific actions," he explained. 

Watson said he did rQx anticipate 
the programs outlined in the Affir-
mative Action Plan would be af-
fected by budget cuts, but noted the 
possibility thai a studenl fee increase, 
might intimidate lower income stu-
dents from applying. 

Edson expressed disappoinnnent 
that two other components of the 
proposed amendments were not 
added to the plan. 

Because Latinos and Filipinos 
have reached the enrollment goals, 
they are no longer target groups for 
outreach. although they are still in-
cluded in retention and academic 
progress programs. Edson's pro-
posal that they continue to be out-
reach groups because of large high 
school dropout rates was rejected. 

"I still feel strongly that Latinos 
and Filipinos would still be Affir-
mativeAction students ifit weren't 
measured by high school gradua-
tion," he said 

In addition to the creation of the 
separate master plan addressing 
disabled students' needs, Edson had 
also suggestedthatdisabledstudeots 
should be included in outreach and 
retention effons. 

Watson's response was that he 
thought the disabled student plan 
would adequately serve those stu-
dents, so they would not be included 
under the Affirmative Action Plan. 

ATKINSON 
Continued from pege 1 
down the rest of the wtiversity to 
focus on undergraduates. That's 
what the California Stale Univer-
sity is - it emphasizes under-
graduate education. 

"[ think the mandate of the UC is 
very special ... and undergraduates 
benefit from [an atmosphere that 
includes research]. 1 don't want to 
destroy that," he said 

Watson suggested that those 
concerned with education should 
make their feeings known to state 
legislators. 

"It's important for students and 
administrators to speak up and say 
what the future may be like if we 
don't make education a priority in 
this state," Watson said 

Public forwns scheduled forboth 
last Wednesday and this Wednesday 
by the Intercollegiate and Recre-
ational Athletic Advisory Commit-
tee (1RAAC) prompted the admin-
istrators to discuss the possi bility of 
a move to NCAA Division D athlet-
ics. 

"[I find it interesting] that we're 
even discussing this issue with the 
budget crunch going on," Atkinson 
said. 

Atkinson suggested that fears of 
UCSD becoming a major athletic 
power in the future are completely 
unfounded. 

"Forthosewhoconsiderthepos-
sibility of big-time athletics, [ can 
say that it's not going to happen 
here," he said 

"I wish other schools would be 
like us ... 1 think we have a very 
innovative athletic department," 
Atkinson said. 

Both Atkinson and Watson sug-
gestedthat ifaDivisionD move is in 

The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD's future, that future is not as 
inunediate as some might think. 

"[lRAAC] will submit the report 
to the chancellor when it is ready-
they hope to submit it by the end of 
the academic year," Watson said 
"Then thechanceUor will send it out 
to different groups for comment." 

Ankinson indicated that not only 
would such a decision take time, but 
that it would encounter consider-
able resistance. 

"If students want to pay [extra 
fees to compensate for Division D 
athletic budgets l, fine, but the fac-
ulty will protest vigorously ,"he said. 
"I guarantee you... nothing will 
happen quickly. If the committee's 
reconunendation is for Division IL 
all sorts of groups will come out of 
the woodwork to oppose it." 

The subject of the possible rees-
tablishment of the Triton Pub . 
brought little response from the two 
administtators. 

Ankinson had no comment on 
the subject, while Watson simply 
indicated his support for the Uni-
versity Center Board (UCB). 

"I feel that the UCB will come 
out with the proper recommenda-
tion," Watson said. 

The UCB will hold its next 
meeting tonight at 5:30 p.m. in the 
eM Cafe. A vote on the Triton Pub 
issue is scheduled, IIIXOI'dingto UCB 
Chair Nick Long. 

The final subject of discussion at 
the forum was the war in the Persian 
Gulf, and the effect that war has had 
atUCSD. 

"I think the key issue is that the 
campus be a platfonn on which is-
sues can be discussed," Atkinson 
said 

However, he suggested that the 
cancellation of classes orthe chang-
ingofcourse subject manerwas not

something he could support. 
"We do have an obligation to 

continue instruction." Atkinsoo said 
"Classes cannot be dismissed ju.~t 
because of the war. [Butl faculty 
should take note of the war." 

When a student in the audience 
said that the chancellor at UC Santa 
Cruz had voluntarily shutdown that 
campus for a day because of the 
war, Atkinson said that he was not 
aware of the event. 

Another student asked about a 
memo co-authol'ed by the vice 
chancellor of Academic Affairs and 
the chair of the Academic Senate 
that was distributed to the chairs of 
UCSD depamnents and programs. 
The memo stated that faculty 
members were contractually obli-
gated to teach their courses and 
follow the course syllabi. 

"If you're teaching a course in 
European History and you throw 
out [the class schedule) ... one is 
failing to do one's duty, and should 
be disciplined," Atkinson said. 
"Each faculty member has to inter-
pret [the memo), keeping in mind 
that they could be called before a 
faculty committee [for disciplinary 
actions]."

borhood bar" will be decided today by the University Center 
Board. If all goes well, 
the "new" pub could be 
open as early as next 
fall. If approved. the 
decision would be a 
great victory for the 
gradUale rodents who 
proposed it, and the stu-
dent body that wlll ben-
efit from it. 

It was less than two 
yem ago that the origi-
nal Tri ton Pub wa 
closed down - much to the dismay of many students - after 
Round Table Pizza outbid it for a much-coveted space in the new 
Price Center. The argument two years ago was that since there 
could be only one alcohol liceose on campus, there could be only 
one pub. That assenion was later proven to be erroneous. There 
is no such rule which limits the campus to one alcohol license. 
Based on that revelation, the Graduate Student Association took 
the opportunity to look into the possibility of rc urrccting the old 
pub. 

If approved, the "new" pub will be somewhat different than 
the old Triton Pub, but will include certain elements which 
Round Table's "Bull 's Eye Tavern" lacks. The old pub has a 
more "earthy" feel which the sleek and much newer Bull's Eye 
Tavem cannot possibly simulate. 

Among ocher things, the new pub will not serve food, and 
while it will generally be known as the Graduate Student Pub, it 
will be open to people of all ages and will be operated by an 
outside vendor -.ch already has an alcohol license. The De-
partment of Alcoholic Beverage Control will not grMtlicenses 
to student organizations. Acquiring an outside vendor will 
circumvent that problem. 

The most significant change to the pub - if all goes as 
planned - will be a massive reduction in its original size. The 
new pub wi II be approximately 900 square feet - or, about one-
tenth the size of the original. Under the new plan, three walls -
two pennanent and one temporary - will be erected to create the 
new pub space. 

The idea is to allow student organizations to continue pro-
gramming events in the pub complex without being significantly 
hindered by the new pub's operations. The inclusion of the 
temporary wall is to allow various student organizations - such 
as Rise - to reserve the entire pub for large events, faciliwing 
access to the bar. 

The question of the pub's smaller size is the one flaw in a 
mostly solid plan. The reduced size will accommodate about 75-
80patrons. Proponents of the plan, sucb as GSA President Daved 
Fremont and University Center Board member Mordecai Pot-
ash, claim that the smaller space will create a more intimate 
atmosphere, especially on nights when there are only 20-30 
pattons. But this assessment does not account for weelcend 
crowds. 

The founders of this plan underestimate the weekend turnout, 
basing their figures on the relatively light weekend patronage at 
the Bull's Eye Tavern. However, many students - especially 
those who remember the old Triton Pub - resent the Round 
Table establishment Many of those students believe Round 
Table killed the pub. It is thQse students who are likely to frequent 
the new pub, and we may safely assume that they are far more 
than 7S or 80 in nwnber. It is possible that the square footage was 
decreased to allow for quiclc and easy approval by the UCB and 
the administration. 

Despite the size problem, clearly any incarnation of the old 
Triton Pub is a step iii the right direction. Hopefully, if the plan 
passes with a significant amount of cooperation from the UCB 
and the approval of both Vice O1anceUor Watson and Olancel-
lor Atkinson, students will be able 10 enjoy an intimate, neigh-
borhood bar very soon.

PROPAGANDA 
Continued from pege 5 

He paraphrases me as saying Ihal 
the U.S. will lose 200 men an hour 
in the impending ground war and 
claims thai this couldn't be possible 
since,1bauneansin 10days, we'd 
lose as many men IlI'in 10 years of 
war in Vietnam." In fact, the opin-
ion, as srared in my article, is that of 
Col. David H. Hackworth. Had 
Burkhart bothered to consult the 
rdmncecited, be would have found 
this quote: "In Ul all-oot Persian 
Gulf conflict. casualties won't be 
200 Americans dead a weet. as in 
Vietnam. 1bey will be more like 
200 dead an hour in the opening 
round-moreiffuel-airexplosives 
and chemical weapons are fired" 
(Newsweele, Jan. 21, 1991). If 
Burkhart finds this statement e~ 
neous, he can take it up with the 
esteemed and highly decorated K~ 
rean and Vietnam War veteran. 

Ralherthan employing the same 
old rhetoric we are wunercifully 
inundated with by the media and by 
Bush himself, it would be refresh-
ing if someone who advocated the 
war could address some of the real 
intriguing questions. 

It seems to me a ~ sophisti-
cated approach to the problem of 
nuclear proliferation wbuld also 
need to be employed, but of course 
our administration officials know 
that. They also know that they must 
frightenthe American public if they 
want it to support a war. 

Furthennore, wby did John 
KeUy, the assistant secretary ofstare 
for the Middle East, testify before 
Congres$ thai the United States had 
no commitment to defend Kuwait? 
Why was April Glaspie, our Am-
bassadortoIraq, instructed by Baker 
to emphasize to Hussein on July 25, 
1990, that the U .s.bad "noopinioo" 
on Iraqi-Kuwaiti disputes? 

SiJICe Hussein made his inten-
tions to invade Kuwait quite clear 
during this mecting. why did Glaspie 
teU the Iraqi President, "I have a 
direct instruction from the President 
to seek better relations with Iraq," 
instead of expressing condemna-
tion? 

Why didn't the U.S. rally inter-
national support against Hussein 
beforethe invasion? The CIA claims 
to have predicted the invasion sev-
eral days before it took place, so 
there is no legitimacy in saying that 
theadministratioodidn'tknow what 
was to come. 

CouIdit be that the Bush Admin-
istration wanted Hussein to invade 
Kuwait and thus did nothing to stop 
him? 

Afterall, a crisis like this pennits 
the U.s. tomainlainamilituy-based 
economy and. by golly, it may just 
help us out of this troublesome re-
cession. 

Not only ..... it diverts IIIIaIIioo 
away from our natioo's horrific 
cbnesric troubles. And, beins the 
"last superpower" Indall, thisc:ould 
be our chance to establish real 
milirary, economic, and political 
cootroI of thai tumuIIuous repon 
that has always been so terribly 
bosIile to the United StaleS. 

Burtbart says that the war ~ 
eestors don'l know why they are 
P<*iBIin&-'Ibllmaybetrueofaome, 
but it is obvious dill the same is true 
of war-supponers. Burkhart hu pven his re.Ien DO IeaIOll to t.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

PRIVILEGE 
ContInued from ~ 5 
unfailingly damages clwmels of 
dialogue, and sends opposing par-
ties fleeing back to their respective 
comers. Again I am not necessar-
ily defending the protesters and 
their periodic lack of insight into 
political realities. But if I may as-
sume that Mr. Burkbart'seditorial 
intent is not simply to insult people, 
but to encourage thought and dis-
cussion, then I strongly believe thai 
this is the wrong way. Off-color 
comments of this ilk are destruc-
tive, and journalistically irrespon-
sible. They bespeak a lack of 
strength and conviction in the ar-
gument the author is advancing. 
They are thecheapcst possible fonn 
of ammunition. 

1 would say to Mr. Burkhart 
something I've been wanting to 
say to many of the less infonned 
protesters: protest isn't just a right. 
it's a privilege, whicb means it's 
also a responsibility. Respect it as 
such. and the potential fordialogue 
blossoms. Abuse it. and our im-
measurably precious system offree 
expression runs the risk of being 
immeasurably dimlnisbecL

see no one protesting aa all? Would 
youlikeeveryonenoddinglheirhead 
to war and bloodshed? Perbaps, if 
we completely agreed, it would give 
the U.S. politicians legitimacy to do 
this again and again. I realize that 
war is inherent in man, but again 
there is no reason that we shouldn't 
strive to perfect ourselves and make 
a peaceful world. Isn't that the rea-
sen why U.s. citizens promote de-
mocracy, so strongly that they will 
sacrifice their lives for it? 

Allhouab divided in opinion. we 
do not have to be divided in rapecI-
ins ea:h individual's riabt to speak. 
1 do not have the IOluIioo to the 
world', problems, but 1getlired of 
people beUling back and forth say-
ing their opinions are mightier. 1be 
bickering apinst one another is 
OOUIIIer-procb:tiVe. 

Let us all just pray for aquictend 
to this war and hope that IS few 
American, allied and Iraqi citizens 
IS poaible die due to this cootlict. 

Let us support thoee tIOopI in the 
Middle East b«ause they are dying

CONSISTENCY 
Continued from ~ 5 
for the low-down on human rights 
abuses? Wby haven't we paid at-
tention to their documentation of 
abuses by Israel in the Occupied 
Territories? Or Kuwaiti, or Saudi, 
or even Iraqi abuses of their own 
citizens? Protests that aim at the 
myriad of motivations and contra-
dictions behind our foreign policy 
are not at all invalid. But Burkhart 
would rather attack the character 
and clothing choices of those who 
question the war than engage in a 
debate he might lose. 

1 doubt Burkhart has made a 
serious effon to seek out and listen 
to the anti-war position. No, he 
won't find it by merely glancing at 
some of the signs carried at many 
rallies - these signs contain slo-
gans, intended both to catch the 
attention of people like Burkhart, 
and to make them consider many 
of the issues invoked. Burkhart 
needs to talk to some of the pro-
testers and listen to speakers. 

I invite Burkhart to come with 
me to a protest, and if he doesn't 
click with tie-dyed, folk-singing 
hippies maybe he can chat with 
others like, say, Ken Blalack, a 
right-wing conservative categori-
cally opposed to the Gulf War. 

Let's not forget tbat many 
people opposed to the war agreed 
with Bush's initial dispatch of 
troops to protect Saudi Arabia from 
a possible invasion. Many, how-
ever, found it unwise and prema-
ture for Bush to allow sanctions 
such a short time to take effect. 
The argument for a longer time-
table 00 sanctions - though a ma-
jor point of dispute on both sides 
- is still a valid one. Although 
Burlduut is fmnly convinced of the 
inefficacy of sanctions, he might 
still wonder how it is that on Dec. 
5, the director of the CIA could 
report that sanctions were having a 
serious effect on Iraq's armed 
forces; then, only a month and five 
days later, entirely contradict his 
earlier position? 

Finally, there's Burkhart's 
IOUChing, yet seriously lacking 
analogy of the child (Kuwait), the 
truck (Iraq), and the heroic by-
stander (the U.S.). As I pointed out 
above, questioning U.S. foreign 
policy is something desperately 
needed these days. When long-
standing policy displays a prefer-
ence for some "children" over 
others, it wamnts serious scrutiny; 
e.g., could April Glaspie have been 
a more watchful babysitter? Un-
fortunalely, Burkhart's analogy 
(like his thinking) allows us only 
one way of saving the child: push 
it out of the way of the oncoming 
truck. Again, because world poli-
tics are not so simplistic, there may 
be other ways of saving the kid; 
and there is surely more time to 
debate them. 

So you see, these are not weak 
aquments. Theydeserveattention, 
wbether or not the war has already 
begun. Commentaries like 
Bwthart', do nodting to further 
discussion. 1 hope il won't disap-
point Dave too much to know that 
I don't conform to his notion of 
left- wing, peace-symbol-wearing, 
folk music-listening, N~ Indica-

THE ORDER OF 

• Scientists study the relationship 
between mental disorders and sleep 
By Gavin ChrIsty 
Ststr WrlIer 

We aU like to think of ourselves as individuals, but we tend to overlook 
things that are common to us all-like sleep. Its universal relevance has 
spurred a great deal of research, particularly at UCSD . 

According to Chris Gillin, director of the Mental Health Research 
Center at the VA Hospital, research indicates a relationship between 
psychological disorden and sleeping patterns. 

"Medicine has begun to realize that sleep is a vel)' imponant physi-
ologic state that has its own unique set of diseases that reflect other 
discues," Gillin said. 

Dr. William Dement, who is considered to be the father of sleep 
research, addresses the link between poor sleep and mental illness in his 
book Some Must Watch While Som~ Sleep. 

"When serious sleep disturbances are present, as they almost always are 
in the mentally ill, the patient's history often indicates that the sleep 
disturbance preceded the acute break with reality," he writes. "Patient'! 
frequently say they would be all right if they could get some sleep. Some 
observations raise the question whether sleep loss is one of the causes of 
mental illness or only of the symptoms." 

A sleep study lab on campus is attempting to find the answer to this 
question. The lab admits patients complaining of faulty sleep coupled with 
mcntaI disorders. Before participating in the study, patients go through a 
screening process that looks at their physical health and psychological 
histories. Paticnta are also given a drug test Finally, subjects are screened 
for sleep apnea, a cessation of breathing during sleep. 

After these preliminary tests, the sleep study can begin. It utilizes 
electrodes u its main tool. A headset with electrodes is attached to the 
patient's bead, one electrode placed on the vertebrae of the neck. another

SLEEP: Patients' sleep habits studied 
UCsD NIGHT ContInued from ... 8 placed under the chin, and • third 

electrode is pul over the hean. To 
achieve minimal interference be-
tween thee1cctrodes and the skin's 
conductivity. the skin is cleaned 
thoroughly beforelwxl. Research-
ers also put a paste in the weD of 
the electrode to improve conduc-
tion between the patient and the 
electroencephalograph (EEG) 
polygraph machine. 

It is this machine that records 
stages of sleep so that the obtained 
infonnation can be analyzed. 

"A recording of one person' S 
sleep is • thousand pages long and 
weighs about 10 pounds." said 
Caroline Ruiz, a staff research as-
sociate. By analyzing these sleep 
records. the researcher can deter-
mine the current stage of a patient's 
sleep according to the lines of the 
print. 

Researchers claim that there are 
five stages of sleep. Stage one is 
characterized by a low voltage EEG 
frequency activity. Stage two con-
sists of waves known as sleep 
spindles and k-complexes. Ac-
cording to sleep researchers, people 
get the most rest during stages three 
and four. which consist of delta 
waves. Finally, Rapid Eye Move-
ment (REM). the fifth stage. shows 
a lack of muscle tone or sleep pa-
ralysis where the eyes dart back 
and forth: it is during this stage that 
people dream. 

Using this data, sleep researcb-
ers look for deviances from DOnna! 
control subjects in those who suf-
fer from mental disorders. 

Researchers have founddefinite 
correlations between sleeping 
disorders and people suffering from 

" Medicine has begun 
to realize that sleep is

REM period and depressed people

"H you can suppress REM sleep,

way to decrease REM sleep.

days without sleep, and when they 
do sleep, they generally lack stages

From the data they have ob-

It was an unlikcly double-biU at 
Golden Hall last Wednesday, when 
Dinosaur Jr. opened for Jane's Ad-
diction. In fact, the only thing the two 
bands share is a record label. 

second. Compared 10 their lasttour after 
the release of Bug in 1988, their sound 
was much more clear and direct. They 
played songs off their last two SST 
albums, and included a few new songs 
from their upcoming Warner Brothers 
release.

England at SDSU on Thursday 
By DneLott 
SUdfWritw 

The English dance craze -
apparent in the swirling, vibrant 
movement of the Manchester scene 
with its lJICfIing of dance and rock 
cultures - has corne to America. 
The music from Manchester, com-
bining Olicaao House-influenced 
beals, modem guitars, and fren-
zied dance with rock 'n' roll drug 
use, has introduced numerous 
bands keen on the feel-good phi-
losophy espoused by the youth of 
England's dark industrial centers. 

Some of the more famous 
Manchester-taued groups include 
The Stone Roses, The Happy 
Mondays,The Inspiral Carpets,and 
now, TIle Charlatans U.K, But are 
The Charlatans just another pop-
industry gift-
wrapped, product 
for young music 
consumers? No. 

pletcd the quintct with drummer 
Jon Brookes, bassist Manin Blunt 
and Hammond organist 
extrordinaire, Rob Collins. 

Brookes cxplained in a recent 
interview that in January of 1990 
"wc got some money together from 
a bank loan wecouldn 't afford and 
went to the studio." 

The resulting single, "Indian 
Rope," ended up selling 20,000 
copies in England and hitting 
number one on the U.K. indepen-
dent charts. After the success of 
their first single, The Charlatans 
signed with Beggars Banquet to 
record their debut, Som~ Fritndly. 
which was released in mid-No-
vember. 

Brookes has mixed feelings 
about their assocation with

Manchester. 
"You sort of feel grateful, arid 

then at the same time, you feci a bit 
fed up about it," he staled. "Thc 
'so-called scene' was only basi-
cally a drug and dance mu ic-re-
lated thing. It lasted only a couple 
of months. By the time the British 
press started to pri nt reports about 
Manchester and the northwe t, that 
was when it was really gone. By 
late '89, the lr\Ie spiritofit diddie." 

Apparently,the "scene" that has 
now reached America is a result of 
wanton commercialism. "A lot of 
record companies were interested

in keeping the whole thing alive to 
malee money," Brookes said. 

If the Manchester scene is dead, 
is all the hype and feeling also 
gone? 

Manchester groups seem to focus Not J st An ot h o~ the. brighter as~ts of lifc. ". U e r 
think Instead of bemg downcast, 
the other groups coming out now I Th A B d 
are the ~o,!,plete opposite," row- wayan 
Brookes saJd, 'They actually glo-
rify where they come from and 
deliberately try to malee things up-
lifting. " 

Many bands in the scene have 
similar-sounding musical cle-
ments. 

But, if you call The Charlatans 
a band with The Stone Roses line-
up with that keyboard player from 
The Inspiral Carpets, they will be-
come very angry. 

"I think anybody that says wc're 
mimicking any other group is re-
ally quite stupid and I feel sorry for 
people with such a small mental-
ity," Brookes said. 

While TIle Charlatans try to dis-
solve the "have wah-wah pedal will 
travel" myth, their music speaks 
for itself. 

The Charlatans' soothingly 
warm and powerful sound is filled 
with conuasts and complex melo-
dies. Dreamy, delayed guiwcom-
bined with the resonance of a 
Hammond organ are overlayed 
with the unabrasive tones of Bur-
gess' vocals. 

But, is this retro- '60s? 
Brookes doesn't believe so. "If 

because we strive for getting good 
feels and good melody across, then 
people suggest we might havc a 
'60s sound. The one thing we've 
got in common with the '60s is that 
we write good songs." 

The confidence of the 
Manchester-related band is high 
for their American debut as a main 
attraction. 

By Jeff StodeI 
Staff Wrilllf 

With their strong debut album 
Cakt, TIle Trash Can Sinatras have 
established themselves as one of 
the most talented and ilUlOvativc 
bands 10 come out of the thriving 
Irvine music scene- that's Irvine, 
Scotland, of course. TIle Trash Can 
Sinauas live, record, and find the 
inspiration for their music in this 
tiny seaport village. 

The band is comprised of vo-
calist Frank Reader,guitaristsJohn 
Douglas and Paul Livingston, 
bassist George McDaid, and 
drummer Stephen Douglas. For 
those of you who have overdosed 
on technopop-e1ectronically-in-

single "Only Tongue Can Tell" 
received such a solid reaction from 
American college and alternativc 
radio stations. 

"I think it's great," he com-
mented, with a strong Scottish ac-
cent. Livingston also pointed out 
that even though the Sinatras arc 
produced by John Leckie (Stone 
Roses, New Order). they havc an 
altogether different sound than the 
psychedelic, Doors-ian rhythms 
coming out of thc Manchester 
scene. 

Their crafty , acoustic-guitar 
work and lively vocals are more 
reminiscent of bands such as The 
Smiths and Aztec Camera. whose 
music dominated the British inde-

it had already obtained a substan-
tia] amount of critical praise from 
the British press. At that time, 
deejay Richard Blade of KROQ 
radio in Los Angcles began play-
ing the Sinatras' new import single 
"Only Tongue Can TeU" on heavy 
rotation. 

Before long, listeners began 
calling thc station, wondering 
where they could get ahold of what 
Ihey thought was Morrissey's new 
single. Blade decided to play along 
and began introducing the single 
as Morrissey's own. After a few 
days, listeners found oul that The 
Trash Can Sinatras were the ac-
tual performers, and "Only Tongue 
Can Tell" went on to become one 
of the honest singles of the sum· 
mer. 

After the succeass of Cake in 
Los Angeles. KROQ invited the 
Sinatras to perform in a charity 
concert at the Universal Amphi-
theater along with other up-and-
comers likc Social Distorition and 
Chris Isaak. 

"The L.A. gig was brilliant," 
Livingston said. "We had a great 
time in California. Wc' re excited 
about coming back."

Ice Hockey Battles USC to 3-3 Tie 
The UCSD ice hockey team 

fought USC 10 a 3-3 tie last night at 
the San Diego Sports Arena. 

The Trojans scored with one 
second left in the final period to tie 
the score. 

The extremely physicil game 
was marred by several cheap shots 
and swinging sticks. 

UCSD had 42 penalty minutes 
ontheevening,comparedloUSC's 
eight. 

The Tritons were again paced 
by Leigh Hsu with two goals, and 
Tom Gould. who added one. 

"It was a fast-paced game, and 
one of our better games," Hsu said. 

The Tritons are now 8-1-2 and 
in first place in the Pacific CoUe-

PHILLER 
ContInued from pege 24 

In any event, at that point. I 
started watching the game for 
things 10 poke fun at in this col-
umn. Like, for instance, forward 
Rick Ban's unbelievable accuracy 
from the two-feot, three-foot, and 
(believe it or not) four-fOOl range. 

Then I began to notice Gordon 
McNeill's odd habil of wiping his 
hands on the soles of his shoes, and 
then applying whatever is on those 
shoes either to his jersey or, even 
better, to his head, with alarming 
regularity. (Maybe it's get.) 

And then I began wondering 
why UCSD has four coaches (in 
equally sharp suits. no less) -
when most pro teams have diffi-
culty hiring even one. 

BUI Head Coach Tom Marshall 
and his dapper entourage are far 
beyond criticism. After lasl year's 
20-7 record and firsl-ever trip to 

giale Hockey Association. Cal 
Tech is in seGond place. 

UCSD is 2-0-1 this season 
against the Trojans. 

Before lasl night's game, il was 
announced that the UCSD-San Di-
ego Stale game originally sched-
uled for Tuesday had been can-
celed. 

RUGBY 
The UCSD rugby team lost 14-

ternoon at Warren Field. 

The Tritons (04) were led by 
Dan Sclunid, who scored a tri, and 
Brian McGannon. who recorded a 
penalty kick. 

the regionals (UCSD lost in the 
first round to Nebraska Wesleyan). 
this year's team - with all of the 
starters returning - was under a 
good deal of pressure 10 improve 
on last season's perfonnance. So 
far, it bas not disappointed. 

When I refocused my attention 
on the game - not its sideshows 
- in the second half, I think I saw 
why this team is so good: it is 
focused. and it is intense. 

As I watched, there was Ban, 
driving hard 10 the basket and pul-
ting down everything he could get 
his hands on. There was McNeill, 
snaring rebounds and nailing the 
outside jumper. There was lack-
son, bringing the ball upcourt and 
throwing the opposition into a tizzy 
with his hard-core defensive pres-
sure. There was Shawcrofi, diving 
for loose balls and playing aggres-
sively on both ends of the court. 
-And of course, there was Rapp, 
scoring, scoring, and scoring.

TheUCSD rugby team dropped 
its fourth match of the season, 
14-7 to Cal State Fullerton. 

Incidentally, it is nol a stroke 
of luck that this year's team is 
riding a school-record II-game 
winning streak, boaSIS a 19·3 
record, and holds down the num-
ber seven spot in the nation. This 
team is just plain good. Damn good. 
ProbablythebestUCSDleamever. 

After last year's loss in lhe 
regionals, Marshall set his goals 
for the following season: "We' re a 
team 10 watch out for. We want te 
win it all nexl year. We won'l 
settle for just getting inlo the play-
offs." 

I doubt this philosophy - in 
Marshall's mind as well as Ihe 
whole team's - has changed any. 
But when this leam does hit lhe 
postseason, you can bet on some 
more damn good baslc.clball-this 
time, probably. from both learns. 
And you can be sure it's gonna be 
entertaining. 

Especially if that really is gel on

Continued from pege 24 
to within six at 58-52 midway 
through the second half. 

But Menlo was just too rattled 
from its first-period beating. Bick-
eringamongst themselves, the Oaks 
could come no closer. and UeSD 
hung on for the eight-point victory. 

"J don't thinlc we sustained well, 
and I thought we were a little flat," 
Marshall said. "We can play at a 
higber level. " 

MarshalJ was referring to the 
Triton' season-long propensity for 
playing in spurts. and expressed 
concern at what he pcrcei ves as the 
Tritons' inability 10 play fony 

minutes of solid basketball. 
Tim Rapp, who was bani ing the 

flu, led the Tritons with 21 points 
and four steals. 

"We wanted to make sure we 
came out pbysical," Rapp said. 

"We missed a couple of easy 
shots early [and) then our defeD5C 
came out and shut [Menlo) down, 
and we started rolling ... 

Rick Ban knocked down 18 for 
UeSD, and freshman Rodney 
Lusain came off the bench to 
contribute eigbt points. 

More importantly, Lusain added 
some exceIJent defense. 

" Defense brings offense," 
Lusain said. "If defense is going to

According to Marshall, one of 
the main reasons that the Tritons 
have looked a little flat in recent 
outings is that they have too much 
time between games. 

"We have played [only) four 
games in three weeks," he said. 
"We playa game and then we have 
to wait a week. 

"It's the worst thing that we 
could be doing right now. At this 
point in the season we should be

with Friday night's loss by West

Men's Lacrosse Pummels USD BASEBALL ContInued from pege 24 
• Cheng, Millan, and Carter 
combine for 11 goals in 21-5 
blistering of Toreros 
By Doug SheddIe 
SWfWrllw 

The UCSD men's lacrosse team continued its 
drive to the West Coast Lacrosse League playoffs 
Saturday at the University of San Diego by defeating 
the Toreros 21-5. With the victory, UCSD improved 
its record to 4-1 overall, 2-0 in conference. USD fell 
to 0-3 overall. 

The game was a blowout from the very begiMing, 
as the Tritons jumped out to a 12-2 halftime score. 

The TriIOnl, after their season-
openinJ lou ro Christ College of 
Irvine, found lbemselves down 4-
I to Cal LuIberan on Saturday. 
UCSD rUlied for two runs in the 
boaomofthenintb on Karl Friedl's 
double, but the Tritons fell short, 
la.i.na 4-3. 

Friedl (2 for 4, 1 RBI) was also 
involved in a key defensive play 
tbatcouldbave altered the outcome 
ofthepme. 

In the top of sixth, with the 
score tied II one, LutbeJan's Dave

bunt sinale. then advanced to third

working ahead of the hiners." 
Tomolonis reflected. "Unfonunately, USD has a very weak tearn this year," UCSD Coach Bob Mcleod said. USD moved 

up to Division] this year after winning last year's 
Divisionnchampionship. AccordingtoMcLeod, USD 
is in for a very long season. Juan MilIan had thrse goals and an assist. 

Oneoutlater, Lutberan'sB1aIce 
Babki bit a shallow fly ball to Friedl 
in left fie.ld. Leonhardt tagged up 
and came to the plate. Friedl crow-
hopped and rifled a strilce to catcher 
Anthony Sanchez but, amidst a 
cloud of dust, the horne-plate um-
pire ruled Leonhardt safe. 

Yates called upon sophomore 
Ryan Aanagan and junior Bryan 
1bomason to relieve Tomolonis 
(0-1). In three games, both 
Aanagan and Thomason have 
made three appearances. 

Junior Ed Cheng led the Tritons in scoring with 
five goals, followed by senior Juan Millan and 
sophomore Lee Carter. each with three goals and an 
assist. Senior Sven Haynie added two goals and five 
assists. 

Next weekend, the Tritons face two of the toughest 
tearns in California - UC Santa Barban and Cal-
in an A11-UC tournament at UCLA. Earlier this 
season, the Tritons lost to UCSB 14-3. 1be Tritons did come out of their shells offensively, banging 

out 12 hits. But the Toros' pitching 
consistenly extinguished any sign 
of a UCSD threat, stranding 12 
runners OIl base. 

Mcleod had nothing but praise for the play of 
Cheng and Caner. "Ed has played phenomenally all 
season, and Lee is starting to playas well as I know 
he can." Mcleod said. 

A venging the loss and beating the state's top teams 
are important goals for UCSD, Mcleod said. Starting pitcher Brent Hansen 

made the most of his first outing as 
a Triton. 

"To win this league, you have to beat the Berkeleys 
and Santa Barbaras. There's no way you can get 
around it," said Mcleod. The junior right bander scat-

tered four runs on six hits, while 
striking out six in seven and one... 
third innings. 

"We hit the ball better, but by 
the time we got going it wu too 
late," first baseman Matt Reis said. 
"[We] need to loosen up. Instead 
of waiting until we're down by 
eight NDS, we need to relax and 
play our game from the begin-
ning."

Theirefficiency was all the more 
impressive when you consider the 
dizzying array ofwnes and presses 
CSUSB threw at UCSD. 

"It was a good game for us 
because we had to adjust our of-
fense every time we came down 
the coun," Malone said. 

In addition, the Tritons more 
than returned the favor on defense 
by limiting CSUSB to 32 percent 
shooting on the night. 

After the struggle in San Ber-
nardino, UCSD expected a much 
easier night Saturday against 
Whittier. And, although they did 
struggle early, the Tritons did not 
disappoint in theend,running away 
with a 39-point win. 

"We were just not in sync at the

beginning against Whittier," 
Malone said. 

With a possible playoff spot on 
the line, UCSD will have to be in 
sync for its final four games of the 
season. 

"All we really need to do is take 
it one game at a time," Malone 
said. 

The way the women's basetball 
team is playing, that shouldn't be 
too complicated. 

"1 felt real good for my first 
time out there," Hanien said. "I 
tried to keep the hiners off balance 
by mixing my pitches up." 

Sunday's matchup against 
CSUDH wasn't as even, as the 
Toros banged out four runs in the 
fllSt and five runs in the second off

The Leader of 
The Pack 
• Wrth last year's top two players 
having graduated, Chris Belloli 
finally has his shot at the spotlight 
By AItftt/ o.yton 
SWfMWllr 

Try to picture Ivan LendI sporting a big loop 
earring. Add a couple of inches, subttact a few years, 
andyoubaveUCSDmen'stenois'nwnbertwosingles 
and number one doubles player - Chris Delloli. 

And if last seuon's rankings are any indication, 
Belloli bas more in common with Lend! than looks. 

After being ranked 34th nationally as a sopho-
more, Belloli has shot up the chans to a preseason 
ranking of eighth in both singles and doubles. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Uyou're the type who doesn't take much stock in 
preseason rankings, how about something more 
concrete - All-American honors in doubles in his 
freshman year and in both doubles and singles last 
season. 

Belloli's preseason top-ten ranlcing looks to assure 
a third straight All-American year for the 6'4" junior 
who had UCSD's best singles record (13-7) last 
season and suffered only one Divisionm loss all year.

Hammenneister. 

In addition, Belloli, along with since-graduated 
Sig Huber, advanced all the way to the doubles 
semifinals of the 1990 NCAA national tounwnent. 

"I know it sounds corny, but I really get along with 
my coach," Belloli said. "He's also a good friend. I 
could talIc to him about anything, whether it's tennis 
or just life." 

Belloli, however, has experienced some recent 
setbacks on his quest to become a three-time AIl-
American. He missed crucial team practices last fall 
after tearing his rotator cuff. 

Considering that this year's UCSD men's team is 
composed almost solely of sophomores and freshmen. 
BelloH's an old hal as a junior, sbaring co-captain 
duties with sophomore Craig Swanson. "I'm still only atabout7S percent of what I used to 

be," he said. "I've been resting the shoulder, so I'm 
Icind of out of shape. " 

"The team is definitely younger [than before]," 
Belloli said. "But there's a lot of excitement among 
my teanunates." This lapse could account for Belloli's loss of the 

nwnber one singles slot to sophomore Chad Morse. Because of his seniority, Belloli has established a 
strong relationship with UCSD Head Coach Jon See BELLOU, Page 17 

PREVIEW 
ContInued from pege 24 
the season with new opponunities 
and a hopeful future. 

"All of our sophomores and 
freshmen are slcilled players," Head 
Coach Jon Hammenneister said. 
"They were the heroes of their high 
school teams, but college is a much 
tougher environment. 

"They've got the skill, what they 
need is experience," he said. 

Junior Chris Delloli reiterated 
Hammermeister's sentiments. "I'm 
kind of glad some top players have 
left, .. he said. 

"Some of the younger guys are 
talented and deserve a shot at some 
top positions." 

But in light of UCSD's recent 
history, men's tennis appears to 
have lost a bit of its footing on the 
higher rungs of Division ill tennis. 

Two seasorts ago, the Tritons 

-• Quiche 
• Seafood Salad 
• Chicken Curry 
• Garden Salads 

were fifth in national preseason 
rankings. However, after placing 
tenth out of 12 teams at the na-
tional tournament last year, the 
Tritons tumbled slightly this year 
to a preseason ranking of eighth. 

TIle power of the team seems to 
lie with Delloli, the current num-
ber two singles player and two-
time All-American. 

"Chris seems to have what most 
of the team is lacking - experi-
ence," Hammenneistersaid. "Plus 
he's got a blistering serve, and an 
incredible baclchand." 

Yet the team finds additional 
strength in the abilities of its 
younger players, namely sopho-
mores Chad Morse and Jack 
Bethard and freshmen John Cross 
and Chris Emery. 

Morse, the current number one 
singles player, transferted from UC 
Santa Barbara. 

"Morse played number one 

against Grossmont during a scrim-
mage," Hammermeister said. 
"He's had extensive experience, 
especially playing in the men's 
open [division]." 

Bethard, who Hammenneister 
said was a "late starter" but is 
"starting to click," improved con-
siderably over last season, boost-
ing his team standing to number 
six in singles and number three in 
doubles. 

"He has some good strokes, 
good genes, and is going to have a 
good year," Hammenneister said. 

Freshmen transfen; Cross and 
Emery both lack Division ill ex-
perience, but have moved quickly 
into the Triton rotation. 

"Both Emery and Cross are very 
solid, "Hammenneistersaid. "They 
played number four and three, re-
spectively, against Grossmont. 

"They are going to be an asset 
in the future," he said.
