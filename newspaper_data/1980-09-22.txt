KSDT 'on the air'; 
constrained by AS 

BY ALICE ROCKEY 
SlafI Writer 

KSDT, UCSD's campus 
radio station, will be able to 
remain on the airwaves after 
all. 

Thanks to a contract 
negotiated with the Associa-
ted Students over the 
summer, the radio station 
will be able to avoid what last 
spring appeared to be certain 
closure. 

The AS had threatened last 
year to withdraw funding 
from KSDT citing the 
station's limited market and 
financial problems. 

But the contract, drafted 
primarily by AS Vice 
President Bill Topkis, is 
binding for the life of the 
station. 

Former general manager 
Kevin Rockwell says he is 
satisfied with the contract, 
finding it "agreeable to all 
parties." 

The agreement gives the 
AS many privileges and 
budaet controls at the station 
in return for its financial 
support. Some of the 

~8ions in the contrlCt 
Include: 

-The AS has ten 60-
aecond spots per week to use 
d~ prime-time periods. 

'- Two two-minute spots 
per week are reeerved for 
campus news. 

-A weekly 3O-minute AS 
F<X1lm has been established 
for use by any student 
organization. The forum 
content will be similar to that 
of the AS Bulletin in t he Daily 
Guardian. Interested 
organizations must petition 
the AS for time slots. 

-Two AS Bulletins, one 
hour in length, will be 
presented each quarter. 
These bulletins will be 
expanded versions of the 30· 
minute forums and will deal 
with specific campus-related 
subjects.

Reg Fee committee plans 
upset student members 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
Vice Chancellor of Student 

Affairs Richard Armitage 
says it will improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness 
of the Registration Fee 
Committee. 

Committee Chair Cathy 
Valerio calls it "the worst 
possible thing that could 
happen to the students' 
budget" and threatens to 
resign if it is approved in full. 

But no matter from whose 
vantage point it is perceived, 
Armitage's Reg Fee Commit· 
tee reorganization proposal is 
creating a stir among a 
number of students and 
administrators. 

The proposal, drafted over 
the summer by Armitage and 
a collection of student affairs 
administrators, calls for a 
reduction in the number of 
committee members and 
greater control of the 
committee b6!rmitage. 

Proposed c ges 
Like last year, this year's 

Reg Fee Committee will 
consist of seven students and 
five faculty or staff members. 
The group is responsible for 
formulating a budget and 
recommending to Armitage 
the allocation of registration 
fees for campus services. 

If the .... reorganizatIOn 
proposal is adopted, however, 
next year's committee will be 
composed of only five 
students plus one faculty and 
two staff members. 

And unlike the commit-
tee's present membership 
selection system, in which 
one student mem ber is 
ehosen by each college, the 
Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Council, 
committee members under 
the proposal would be 
selected by Armitage from a 
list of recommendations 
submitted by the same 
students. 

Another- proposed change 
is that the committee 
formulate budgets twolears 
in advance instead 0 one 
year in advance, as is 
currently done. 

The combination of these 
. changes, Valerio says, will 

cause students to "lose 
control of the budget." 

She explains, first, 
Armitage will create a 
"puppet committee" by 
makmg his own membership 

Richard Annita.e 
appointments. 

Armitage, however, says 
that by appointing student 
committee members, he can_ 
better assure that a wider 
range of special interests are' 
represented. 

He explains that "colleges 
are immaterial" for student 
representation, while more 
important membership 
criteria are ethnicity, sex and 
experience. 

Students will also lose 
control of the Reg Fee budget 
through the proposal's call 
for a two-year instead of a 
one-year review according to 
Valerio. 

She explains that since the 
committee would be working 
on the following year's bud-
get, it would not be able to 
address budget changes or 
modifications for the fiscal 
year the committee is meet-
ing. 
Students not consulted 

Valerio and other students 
also complain about 
Armitage's handling of the 
proposal's formulation. 
Instead of consulting with 
students or reg fee members, 
Armitage met with other 
student affairs administra-
tors at a summer retreat in 
part to discuss changes in the 
committee.

Brown nOlllinates 
four new regents 

Four new members of the 
UC Board of Regents -
including a prominent rock 
music businessman - were 
appointed Thursday by Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr. 

The appointments add to 
Brown's influence on the 
board, but he is still short of 
controlling a majority of its 
26 members. The Board of 
ReHents is the powerful 
pohey-making body of UC. 

Leading the governor's list 
is Democratie Assemblyman 
Willie Brown of San 
Francisco. Brown is the first 
legislator ever to be 
appointed to a rege.nt's post, 
although the Speaker of the 
Assembly, ~erves t~e board in 
an ex officIO capacIty. 

The governor also named 
rock record magnate David 
Geffen of Beverly Hills to the 

board. Geffen, '5l, founded 
Asy1um records and chaired 
the board of Electra! Asylum 
Records before establishing 
his own firm, Geffen Records. 

The third nomination went 
to Frank Clark Jr., 62, a 
senior partner in the Los 
Angeles law firm of Parker, 
Miliken, Clark and O'Hara. 
Clark is also executive vice-
president and director of the 
May Company Department 
Stores. 

Brown's final appointment 
is Willis Harman, 62, a senior 
social scientist at the 
Stanford Research Institute 
and a profesSOr of engineer-
ing/economics systems at 
Stanford University. 

All four appointments 
must now be confirmed by 
the state Senate. If all are

Don't Register: Resist 

Many of you wtll turn 19 this year and be faced with an 
unpleasant bihMay present from the President: a choice 
of Rgistration with the Selective Service System or a 
$5,000 fine and prison term. 

When President Carter activated the Selective Service 
System, he reformed it, rightfully eliminating loopholes 
for rich white kids who find it easier to afford 
universities. So, those of you about to become eligible must decide 
whether to register or resist. 

We believe you should resist. The justification we hear 
molt often for. registering is the penalty for not doing so: 
the fines and the sentence. We think that reason 
unjustifiably downplays the intellectual issue: whether 
the President should use the liberty and flesh of 19 and 20 
year-olds .to send a message to a nation we have already 
promised not to bother militarily. 

The constitution gives the President the right to 
provide for the national defense. It does not give him the 
rilht to invade our privacy for a limited, temporary 
political goal, . . , 

The ineffectiveness of the move mtemahonally IS 
already obvious; the President's public statements that 
anyone can register as latt; as they want indicate tha~ he 
is not serious about cracktng down on those who fall to 
aWn up at their post office. 

Voting Nov, 2 is one way to send a message to the 
federal government. Resisting registration is another, 
just as honorable and, we hope, more effective. 

A Union for Students 
A union, the California State Employees Association, is 

now trying to organize students to fight for the rights 
every other worker gets as a matter of course, 

We commend the union and urge every student to aid 
the CSEA by joining it or another union. Student union 
membership can help solve some of the problems 
students confront working here. 

For example, students receive no UC benefits for 
campus jobs because no one who works 19 hours or less 
can receive these benefits. Students are also prohibited 
from working more than 19 hours a week by the 
university. 

Since we are absolutely sure the administration 
sanction against working more than 19 hours had nothing 
at all to do with state benefits nates, we believe a union 
will simply help the people who run UCSD gain a better 
perspective on how students work.

Reagan-a likeable, simple 
... and dangerous candidate 

BY C. McWIlliAMS 
Corey Mc Williams. one 01 

this ~,.t,,·s ltIuiing libe,al 
thinkers. wrote this piece for 
the Pacilic News Service 
shorlly belore his deoth last 
]Nne. 

It is my belief that the 
Establishment - that elusive 
but very real force in 
American life - has of recent 
weeks opted decisively for 
Ronald Reagan. I also believe 
he will be elected president. 

The reasoning behind that 
conclusion may be a bit 
perverse. however. I am 
convinced the Establishment 
has decided that authori-
tarian controls must be 
imposed to get the country 
out of the mes in which it 
finds itself, that there is no 
other way to preserve the 
power structure. 

It would be fatal to such a 
straegy if the man in the Oval 
Office had even a whiff of the 
demagogue about him. What 
the strategy calls for is a 
President who enjoys the 
confidence of the people. a 
President who is regarded as 
a nice guy. 

Ronald and Nancy Reagan 
are a familiar and likeable 
Jetter 
Night and 
Fog Action 
Rrlitor: 

It is disappointing ancl 
somewhat IIhocking to find a 
group calling itself 'Night 
and Fog' at UCSD. This 
phrase has an established 
historical meaning: the ter-
rorists activities of the Nazi 
55 in Gennany and occupied 
territories. When homosex-
uals, Jews and opponents 
of Hitler's regime were torCed 
out of their houses in the 
middle of the night and killed. 
this was referred to as a 
'night and fog action.' 
r can only presume that the 

members of the present 
group are u~ware of the 
meaning of their name to 
most of the world. I urge 
them to drop it, whatever 
their intentions.

couple. The former Cali-
fornia governor is a bright, if 
not original thinker. He 
radiates traditional Ameri· 
can values .• He is not a hater . 
He likes people. He appears to 
feel that there is good in 
almost everyone. He is a very 
secure man; what you see is 
what he is. 

If a figurehead President is 
desirable. Reagan is the ideal 
nominee. As controls began 
to be imposed. people would 
not gra s p what was 
happening until it was too 
late. 

Ronald Reagan exudes the 
faith that happy days are just 
around the corner, that there 
are simple answers to 
complex Questions. And in 
these trou bled times he 
appeals strongly to anyone 
who does not want to face the 
unpleasant implications of an 
era of limits and retrench· 
ment. 

This. he tells us, is the 
reality. The nightmare 
version of our future is false. 
He is sincere . but a 
newspaper friend once 
reminded me that sincerity. 
like virtue. is an art. 

This scenario of a 
figurehead presidency for an 

authoritarian Establishment 
is one that I advance with 
great hesitation. But there is 
reason to believe that it 
reflects a dangerous 
possibility and therefore 
should carefully be consider-
ed. 

The structure of the 
Imperial Presidency, after 
all, has not been entirely 
dismanteled. The CIA has 
ample capacity to carry out 
dirty tricks and domestic 
assignments . The Repub· 
Iicans are publicaly favoring 
a relaxation of constraints on 
the FBI as proposed by 
Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt. 
a close Reagan advisor. Local 
police intelligence agencies 
have the necessary files and 
dossiers to facilitate 
widespread surveillance. 

Under the guise of a 
'national emergency,' such 
controls simply could be 
imposed in a piecemeal 
fashoin - and the events 
ahead might well seem to 
warrant them. Reonald and 
Nancy Reagan may project a 
nice, friendly image of 
security and happiness, but a 
well meaning Reagn would be 
in no position to restrain the 

pleue turn to pale 19

PLO offers to recognize 
Israel-for an exchange 

IFRANE, MOl'OCCO -
King -Hassan " of Morocco 
said yesterday the Palestine 
Liberation Organization is 
ready toacceptIsrael"witbin 
secure and recognized 
boundaries" as soon as [srael 
agrees to similar recognition 
of a Palestinian state. 

The king, who has close 
and friendly relations with 
PLO guerrilla leader Yasser 

. Arafat, made the statement 
during a rare news confer· 
ence at his hilltop summer 
palace here. 

"The problem of the 
recognition of Israel could 
have been settled long ago" 
he said .. "The PLO is ready to 
recogntze Israel within 
secure and recognized 
boundaries, but Israel must 
accept that the PLO also has 
the right to a country within 
recognized boundaries." 

Some moderate factions 
within the PLO have hinted 
at the possibility of trading 
recognition for an autono-
mous Palestinian state. 

Israel has consistently 
refused to consider establish-
ment of such a state. 

although it has agreed in 
prtnciple to some form of 
Ii~i~ed autonomy for the 1.2 
mllhon Palestinians living in 
Israeli-occupied territories. 

At the news conference. 
~assan referred several 
times to a proposed 
Palestinian state incorP,Ora-
ting "pre-1967 borders' -
the territocy Israel captured 
during its war with the Arabs 
that year. 

That would mean Israel 
would have to surrender all of 

t~e West Bank of the Jordan 
River, including its settle-
ments ther~, the Gaza Strip. 
the strategic Golan Heights 
and predominantly·Arab 
East Jerusalem.

The Tass commentary was 
one of several 'criticisms in 
the Soviet press yesterday of 
Friday's accident. in which 
an AIr Force sergeant was 
killed and 21 others injured. 

Official American assur-
ances that the risk of a 
nuclear explosion was 
minimal. "hardly reassures 
the US public. which justifiably fears that in the . 
conditions of war hysteria 
fanned by the Carter 
administration, every 
accidental explosion of an 
American strategic rocket 
can be mistaken as a 'nuclear 
attack' from outside. and 
touch off a nuclear conflict," 
Tass said.

Silly President Charlton, 
faced with a vacancy on his 
munal, has decided to "open 
student pemment up to the 
people' and raffle off 
Anderson's commissioner-

chance at being picked. 
Charlton's plan to replace 

Anderson, though in keeping 
with advocacy of silliness, 
may fail due to a clause in the 
AS by-laws. 

"I think it's a great idea, 
but 1~lIy he just can't do 
that,' says AS Advisor 
Randy Woodard. "The by-
laws state that the new 
commissioner must be 
appointed and approved by 
the Council." 

Charlton, however, has no 
Qualms about raffling off the 
AS position.

Governor Jerry Brown renewed his fight last week 
against UC's control over two nuclear weapons labs.

"Lee i. .pendin,. fall

SAN FRANCISCO -
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
vowed Friday to "do 
everything in my power" to 
end the University of 
California's management of 
the nation's two nuclear 
weapons labs. 

But despite the governor's 
strident appeal, university 
regents voted 15 to 5 to 
launch negotiations with the 
federal Department of 
Energy to renew the five-year 
'COntract, which runs out in

tion, but he added, "I don't 
know how we ~t from Point 
A to Point B." 

He predicted public 
pressure to separate UC and 
said he anticipated that the 
weapons labs would grow by 
the time the contract itself 
comes before the regents next 
year. 

The university has 
operated Lawrence Liver-
more lab in California and 
Los Alamos lab in New 
Mexico, as well as their 
forerunners for half a 
century. President David 

Saxon has argued that the 
university provides a 
valuable national service by 
insulating the research at the 
labs from political and 

bur~ucratic pressure. 
But Brown charged that 

the university "is basically a 
cover ... so the laboratOries 
can do pretty well what they 
want, free from the 
university's control, free 
from control by the President 
of the United States, high •

Rockwell expresses a

Another clause provides 
that the AS will place a

working member will be 
required to make periodic 
reports to the AS on the 
status of KSDT operation.

It was the "end of the lines blues" for hundreds of UCSD students la8t Friday .. 

KSDT lives on, with AS 
continued from paee 1 
last year's $8,400 allowance. 

An additional $3,000 has 
been allotted to KSDT for 
new equipment, most 
notably the carrier current 
system necessary to bring 
KSDT reception to at least 75 
percent of all on-campus 
residents. 

Since June 1, KSDT has 
been operating at a loss 
because AS money will not 
become available until the 
contract is o~ficially 

approved at the first AS 
council meeting on Sept. 24. 
The KSDT steering commit-
tee must submit a line item 
budget detailing all expenses 
before any money will be 
appropriated. 

KSDT members say they 
plan to hire an advertising 
sales manager within the 
next few weeks. His or her 
salary will be drawn from the 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs office funds. 

The new sales manager 

must sell $800 in advertising 
within three months or face 
dismissal. 

KSDT is tentatively 
scheduling nine to 12 hours of 
air time daily duritlJl the 
school year. That time will 
be divided into four shows, 
according to Rockwell. 

"We'll have a tight sound

Reg Fee changes 
continued frQm PBJee 1 
would make decisions about 
the Reg Fee (Committee) 
without the Reg Fee 
(Committee)," Valerio says. 
"r think the committee 
should have some say in what 
happens to them." 

Armitage defends the 
summer retreat formula, 
however, saying that it 
serves the best interests of 
students. "You've got to 
believe me," he says, "we 
were doing this for the 
students. " 

No students or Reg Fee 
members were invited to the 
retreat, he says, since his 
directors "won't speak 
frankly with some students, 
because they've been burned 
on some issues. " He says his 
directors "just wanted to sit 
down as a family." 

Valerio says she does not 
object to being excluded from 
the "family" as long as the 
proposal is "only considered 
ideas." 

And according to Armi-
tage, the proposal isjust that. 
"This is not set in concrete," 
he says. Reg Fee members, 
students, faculty and staff 
members have been asked to 
comment on the proposal he 
says. "As far as I'm 
concerned, students can do 
anything they want with 
that document," he adds. 

Armitage says he will 
solicit opinions on the 
proposal for three or four 
weeks before submitting a 
final draft for approval to 
Chancellor Richard Atkin-
son. 
Other changes 

The R~ Fee proposal also 

removes the guarantee of a 
student chafr, i"nstead 
leaving open an option for a 
faculty or staff member 
chair. Valerio says this would 
further erode students ' 
influence on budget policies. 

Additionally, committee 
'members would be required 
to serve a two-rear term on 
the committee, mstead of the 
current one-year term. 
A<;co!,ding to Armitage, this 
WIll tOcrease the expertise of 
members and provide more 
continuity within the 
committee. 

The proposal also calls for 
a reduction in the number of 
interns and CGilsultants that 
presently serve the commit· 
tee. 
Necessary changes 

It seems to be a matter of 
opinion as to whether or not 
the ~ Fee needs to be 
reorganIZed. 

Armitage denies Valerio's 
char~ that he is trying to 
"gam control" of the 
committee. Instead, he says, 
he is "trying to cut down the 
numbers in the committees 
and represent all consti· 
tuents.' 

He explains: "There's so 
many people on the 
committee that want to aa 
their two cents in, that they 
doo't get down to the nitty 
gritty of t~." Under the 
J!l"e&ent commIttee struct1,lre, 
'we don't get a chance to look 

at the larger issues," 
Armit. says. 

Valeno, however, believes 
a smaller committee will not 
be able to fully explore budget 
issues and I)ptions. "It

A Fanciftil 
La Jolla 
Exhibit 

' Late Entries to the 
Tribun, Competition ,' an 
exhibition of 68 large scale 
(3x5 ft .) architectural 
drawings by 87 architects 
and theoreticians· all entries 
in a serond Chicago Tribune 
Tower Competition held 58 
years after the first orie . has 
opened at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art. 

The perspective designs 
fm- a skyscraper to house the 
newspaper offices of the 
Cllicogo Tribun, follow the 
guidelines established for the 
original 1922 competition, 
although this time no actual 
structure is intended to 
result. What is intended is 
that they present an 
overview of architecture in 
the late 19705, which like the 
early 20s has been a time of 
transistion, and that they 
provide a theoretical format 
for comparing the architec· 
tural ideas of both periods. 

The original competition, 
won by Chicago architects 
Howells and Hood, as well as 
t he exhi bition catalouge 
itself, are all considered of 
great importance by 
architectural historians . 
Because recent changes in 
arch i tectural thinking 
include a revival of interest in 
the use of history and 
symbolism, many of the 1980 
designs included in this 
exhibition are intentional 
comments on the state of 
contemporary architectural 
design and on the original 
competi~ designs. 

Also use the designs 
are theoretical and not 
created for an actual 
structure (the Chicago 
Trihne has no intention of 
altering or replacing its 
present 'landmark' building), 
some of the drawiJ1llS in the 
current exhibitIOn are 
fantastic or whimsical. 

They include projects by

Anderson, Reagal): 
a 'Great Debate' 

BALTIMORE-Republi-
can Ronald Reagan and 
independent John B . 
Anderson staged two-thirds 
of a "Great Debate" last 
night, at odds on tax cuts, 
abortion and defense 
spending, but united in their 
criticism of President Carter 
- "the man who isn't here 
tonight." 

Reagan said he's for a tax 
cut . Anderson said he's 
against it, and both said 
Carter should have joined 
them to debate the 5,ubject. 

Reagan said anyone who 
thought it unfair for them to 
assail the absent Democratic 
president should remember 
that "it would have been 
much more unfair" for the 
independent Anderson to 
have been denied his debate 
seat. 

It was Anderson's 
inclusion that led Carter to 
shun the debate. 

That left the debate stage 
to the Republican presiden-
tial nominee and the 
independent Anderson , a 
Repu blica n congressm a n 
himself. 

Regents 
natned 
continued from .. te 1 
approved, Brown will have a 
total of nine appointees. Even 
though the regents' tenn was 
recently reduced from 16 to 
12 years, the board is still 
donrinated "by' merrlbers 
seated by Brown's father, 
former Gov. Edmund Brown 
Sr., and former Gov. Ronald 

~n. 
. . 

How..ver, m a statement 
lssued through his executive 
secretary, Gray Davis, 
Brown denied wanting to 
control tbe board. 

With Brown's failure to 
appoint a female regent last 
week, only one woman, 
Vilma Martinez, sits on the 
board. 

The governor's appoint-
ment of Assemblyman 
Brown sparked some 
controversy among univer-
sity officials. They did not 
object to Brown's legislative 
record, but cited a passage in 
the state constitution which 
reads: 

"The university shall be 
entirely independent of all 
political or secterian 
mfluence and kept free 
therefrom in the appoint-
ment of its regents .. .' 

Brown, an attorney and 
presently chairman of the 
Revenue and Taxation 
Committee, replaces William 
Coblentz of San Francisco. 

Geffen, a Demoaat, sits on 
the board of directors for the 
American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern Cali-
fornia. He fills the unexpired 
term of Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, who resigned from the 
board when Brown appointed 
her to the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors. 

Clark, another Oemocrat, 
lI'aduated from Hastinis 
CoIleRe of Law. He fills the 
unexpire4 term of Gregory 
Bateson, who died in July. 

Harman, the lone Repub-
lican nominee, received his 
Ph.D. from Stanfor4. He 
replaces Fred Dutton of San 
Mateo. 

Anderson said the debate 
showed that Carter is wrong 
in insisting the American 
people have only two choices 
for the White House. the 
Republican or the Democrat. 
He said he offers a real ' 
alternative, "the kind of 
coalition government that we 
need in 1980 ... " 

He told voters that "if you 
really think that I am a 
spoiler," look at unemploy-
ment, the decline of US 
military forces, the waning 
participation of Americans in 
their own political system. 

He said he could cope with 
such problems, and better 
than either major party 
candidate. 

At intervals, the debating 
candidates took slaps at 
Carter for rejecting the 
J-eague of Women Voters 
invitation to r.onfront them.

The community surround· 
ing UCSD abounds in bike 
paths. A new bike lane is 
planned for Nobel Drive over 
by La Jolla Village Square, 
and in most places where 
there aren't marked lanes the 
roads are usually sufficient 
for cars and bicycles to travel 
harmoniously . A clear bike 
route exists all the way up to 
Solana Beach (and beyond if 
anyone cares to go further), 
and La Jolla also has some 
bikeways delineated. It is 
best to circumvent Torrey 
Pines Road north and south 
between 4 pm and 6 pm 
during the week, due to a 
dramatic increase in 
automobile congestion and 
an apparent drop in the 
average driver's ability to 
view any cyclist present. 
Prospect Street through La 
Jolla is a better route at this 
time; it's Oat, less aowded,

New waterpolo coach at UCSD 
brings confidence of success 

The women's vol-
leyball team goes 
into their next 
match today with a 
dismal 1-4 record. 
The team has drop-
ped the last four 
games, including 
three in the past 
week. They host 
Southwestern Com-
munity College in 
the Main Gym today 
at 4 pm. The scrim-
mage against a two-
year college will 
provide an opportu-
nity for the team to 
hone fundamentals 
and return to last 
year's winning form. 

Former SDSU coach held team's first spring training 
coatiDaed from .. p 15 
finish at national competi· 
tion. He plans to establish the 
same winning tradition here. 

For the first time in the 
waterpolo team's history, the 
players held a spring training 

camp under Harper 's 
direction . He used these 
workouts to familiarize 
himself with the players and 
at the same time allow the 
team to adjust to his styLe of 

This extra conditioning 
will payoff when UCSD faces 
such awesome and experi· 
enced opponents as UC 
Berkeley, Pepperdine, Cal 
State Fullerton and last 
year's national runner·up, 
UCLA. . 

But with Harper's sideline 
coaching and four ·year 
starting seniors Dan Ebbr, 
Ed Profumo, and Steve Max s 
leadership in the water, the 
season looks promising. The 
season opener is this Friday 
against Redlands, at 7:00 pm 
in the Natatorium.

Associated Students 
President Jeremy Charlton 
says he is "the first to admit 
that the Reg Fee has

Armitage's proposal is only 
" an easX solution to the 
probl.em. ' 

Meanwhile, Armit~ says 
he is "the first to admIt" that 
his proposal is imperfect. But 
some kind of chan~ is 
needed, he says. Accordtng to 
Armitage when he reor~·

had said, "Let 's try it for two

election. 

Reagan told a post·debate 
rally that t he cheers he heard 
there convinced him he'd 
been successful in the debate. 

" I'll sure sleep well 
tonight," Reagan said. As he 
left the convention center, he 
said that asking a debater 
now he did is "like asking an 
actor on openini night to 
criticize the play.

good" about his showing. As

Mixology 101: A History of GOod Times 
The Doctorbird is a new mixed drink 

that's made to go with good times. You 
begin with Rumona( the deliciou.s rum 
liqueur from Jamaica. Just mIx 1V2 
ounces of Rumona to 3 ounces of milk, 
add a dash of Angostura Bitters, shake 
and pour. Then sit down to a smooth 
drink that ranks at the head of the class 
for great taste. 

Enrollment is limited only to those 
who love a good time.

initially with Mr. Anderson." 
Much of the debate 

revolved around economics. 
And Carter. 

"Gov. Reagan is not 
responsible for what has 
happened over the past four 
years, nor am I," said 

Anderson, warning that 
inflation could surge again. 

In a debate-day campaign 
commercial, R~an suggest· 
ed Carter didn t show up 
because he didn't want to 
answer for high inflation and 
high unemployment. 

Regents OK nuke labs 
COlitinUed from pale 4 
and have not managed 
"what is perhaps the most 
serious business, not only in 
the United States, but in the 
world," Brown charged. 

The labs, he said, snould be 
run by "a presidential board 
of regents," including 
"theologians, scholars and 
prominent people repre-
sentative of American 
society.'" 

Some 50' anti-nuclear 
demonstrators marched in a 
picket line, sang songs and 
chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho, 
weapons labs have got to go!" 

for Info 

before the meeting. They 
then packed the spectator's 
gallery, greeting the 
governor's remarks with a 
standing ovation. More than 
200 persons were present at 
the meeting. 

But Brown had the 
opposite effect on several 
of the regents. 

Saxon Challenged Brown's 
claim that there is "a moral 
vacuum" at the university, 
·accusing the governor of 
"demagoguery" for suggest· 
ing that his opponents were 
immoral.

Suppose the Russians

Regan cannot not move 
without t he powerfu.l support 
of the Establishment now 
lining up behind him, which 
could mean a crack-down on 
everything· and everyone . 
the Establishment sees as 
subversive. It could mean a 
return to the mentality of 
security clearances and 
loyalty tests. It could mean 
that individuals suspected of 
holding the wrong opinions 
will find it harder to get and 
hold jobs. 

It could recrrate the 'us

which we knew to our shame 
in the McCarthy era, and 
appear to have shamefully 
forgotten today.
