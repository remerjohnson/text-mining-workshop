Theatre 
Hearing 
Empty 
by Katherine Hainer 

S&aff Wri&er 
What if a public hearing was 

held and nobody came? Such 
was the case with the hearing 
held last Thursday concerning 
the proposed University 
Theater, to be built south of the 
Humanities-Library Building. 

The purpose of the hearing 
was to scrutinize carefully a 
recently completed draft 
Envlropmental Impact State-
ment for the new theatre. A 
final EIS will go to tt1e Regents 
for approval in March. 

According to the draft EIS, 
the three main functions of the 
new theatre will be creating a 
teaching and performance 
faciUty for UCSD; perform-
ance facility for the San Diego 
Theatre and Arts Foundation 
during the summer months; 
and a theatre for progtams 
developed for "underpri-
v ileged and culturally-
deprived children. II 

According to the draft EIS, 
funding for the project is 
cominl from the San Diego 
Th Ana FOUIldaUon. 
and the estimated cost is about 
$2.7 million. Also included in 
the statement is the anticipated 
addition of six faculty and staff 
members. 

Actually, there were three 
people in attendance; Don 
Sites, Vice-Chancellor of 
Facilities Management, a 
secretary and a Guardian 
reporter. 

According to Sites, the 
increase in . noise lev~1 during 
the 16-month construction 
period,' 'should have no 
ad verse effect on those 
studying In Cluster Library." 

Once the final EIS has been 
approved by the Regents, Sites 
said, the plans will go out two or 
three months to construction 
companies for bids .

Barry: Take Your Ball and Go Home 
W ell, well, I see where UCSD's b ... sketball 

coach, B ..... ry Cunning-
ham is resigning, After 

nine yei.lrs of cOi.lching here he 
has seen noimprovemenl.1t 's a 
good thing the college ... Iumni 
... od community f4lithful didn't 
notice or they would have had 
Burry's head years ago. 
Perhi.lps you should caU Gene 
Burtow (ex-UCLA basketball 
coach) i.I nd find out how you can 
get the fans to h,mg you in 
effigy. And at the same time 
why don't you find out how 
Gene Wi.lS ableto rileulHhe fans 
to 1n"1 ke them ra bid and 
vicious . almost subhuman. 
Aftel' all Gene's couching 
record (at UCLA) wus only 52-
9, I'm told th"t yours is SO-105 
(to date) . 

unfortunate thut morc collcges 
and high schools don' t adopt o.l 
similar program . Thosc 
students who aren't (Iuite good 
cnough to play on the 
intercollegio.lte tCo.lms or don ' t 
h,,\'e enough time to devote to 
them, are still able to 
1>lII'ticipatl' on " le\'eI that fits 
Ihci I' "bilit ies. The students feel 
a dcsire for SPOltS J);tl'til'ip;tlion 

not a .. glol'i ncd i ntcl'collcgiate:

All th"t wc want is to be able 
to I)artiti()ate in s()orts,

that \'ou hm'c devoted your life

an\' ad\'"ncements in your nine 
ye: .. 's as baskctball coach hcre. 

UCLA . 01' cvcn SI. John's. 
h .. lsll't called you to co;tch thcil' 
team. but in the pasL nine years 
thousands of ·tudents hm'c 
been ablc to partici()ate in 
.athletics through UCSD's 
"glorified intramural pro-
gl'am." 

Bm'I'Y. your twelve years of 
association with the UC 

intercollegi"te program didn 't 
comc to nothin~ . RathCl' it 
tame to everything. So your 
coaching record isn't 486 wins 
,lIId 67 losses. SUI'C you didn't 
coach ,I Jabb;tr. ,lIld you didn't 
coach <I national c1wlllpion , but 
I'athcr you've enriched the lives 
of all those students you ' ve 
co,t(:hcd and given YOUI' time to. 
Don't bc so frustr<lted, UCSD's 
cam()us athletics has been set 
up-to benefit the majority of its 
students. A mujol'ity thut is 
able to " derive benefits from 
participaling with other 
uthletes , receiving instruction 
from qualified coaches, und 
striving for excellence." 

Burry, we've got a good thing 
going here. Thc support given 
UCSD's int ..... mural program 
by the students is a well-
descl'ved support. The name of 
the game is p¥rticiJ1<llion. And 
one thing is for sure , UCSD 
students would rather tuke an 
active p<lrt in sports com-
petition than wutch Lhe 
intercollcgi"te J)rogram take 
over.

Bakhtiar Reportedly Gives 
Up Prime Minister Post 

Israel OKs Camp

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -
Prime Mini tel' Sh;thpour 
Bakhtiar reportedly resigncd 
reslcrd;tv after Iran 's milit"l ry 
~'hicf eI~lc"rl'd s upport 1'0'1'

The go v C I' n m e nt n e \' s 
agency placed the de;tt h toll in 
Tehr;tn at more th,ln 200 with 
scores killed in other cities 
during twodays of bloody streel 
fighting . 

JEHLJSALEM (AP) - ls r ... el 
yesterday "lccc J)ted :In 
AmericHn invitation to I'esume 
pe;.tcetulks with EgyptutCamp 
Duvid, Md .. luter this month 
but announced no softening of 
its stund on unresolved issued. 
Egypt uccepted the invitation 
last week. 

Prime Minister Mcnachem 
Begin sa id there would be a 
break in the Camp Duvid talks 
so Foreign Minister Moshe 
DayMI and Egyptian Primc 
Minister Mustara Khalil' could 
co nsult with their govcrn-
mcnlS, an indication that the 
talks may go beyond the three 
or four clays origina lIy J)lanned. 

The meeting is cxpected to 
st~II' 1 in "boul IO days , but no 
time has been ofril'ially 
' lIlllounced. 

Begin rejected criticism in 
thc unnual U . S . State 
Department humun rights 
report alleging that Isruel 
sus pended human rights 
protection in some security 
c;'lses in the occupied West 
Bank of Jordun and the Gazu 

trip, 
" I canne t uccept that 

cri ticism , but I don't think it 
will huve any bearing on the 
negotiutions ," Begin rcplied 
when usked if the a llegations 
could affect the Cump David 
tal ks . 

" There is no torture in 
Israel." he told reporters after 
the Cubinet session. 

The human rights l'epol't 
accu d Isruel of "instances of 
mistreatment" of Palestinian 

prisoners, but gave Israel good 
mm'ks for conduct in territory 
c<.tptured In the 1967 war. 

Begin said Isruel had 
protested to the Statc 
Department over points in the 
hum a n rights report it 
considered unfair. 

Begin said the Cabinet took 
no new policy decisions that 
would release Dayan from 
earlier positions in his talks 
with Khalil and Secretary of 
State Cyrus R. Vance. 

Egypt is demanding a target 
date for the beginning of 
Palestinian self-government in 
the areas now ruled by an 
Israeli military government. 
ButIsraelsaysltc8Dnota,ree 
since there is no lUarantee the 
Palestinians will cooperate, 

In addition, Egypt opposes an 
Israeli demand that a treaty 
supercede any previous 
Egyptian defense treaties. 

Khomcini's followers took 
over Tehran Radio and issucd a 
series of · elirectives fmlll Ihe 
Provisional Revolutionary 
Governmcnl. Thc broadc:tst's 
s.tid the shah-b~lcked Hakhtiar 
government had f~lIlen anel all 
members of Parliamenl had

The Khollleini followers a Iso 
reported fighting continued in 
some cities but urged Tehran 
residcnts "W ref"'l i n I'rolll 
lItt<lcks on the armed forccs 
now that the revolution has 
triumphed anel the armed 
forces hm'e surrcnelered." 

Among Ill;tny rumors 
circulating in Tehran were tll;tt 
Bakhtiar had f1cd the eountry 
and that he committed suieide.

York, Former Chancell,or, 
Named to Head Test Ban Team 

Dr, Herbert York, director of 
the Program of Science , 
Technology and Public Affairs 
at UCSD has been named chief 
negotiator for the United States 
to the comprehensive nuclear 
test ban treaty talks in Geneva , 

York, former UCSD Chan-
cellor , was appointed by 
President Carter to head the US 
delegation, which will seek to 
negotiate a treaty with Great 
Britain and the Soviet Union to 
ban nuclear testing. A limited 
treaty was signed by the U,S, 
and the Soviet Union in 1963. 
. Currently on special leave 

from the university, ' York 
attended briefings in Wash· 
ington, D.C. before flying to 
Geneva, where negotiations 
began Monday. York succeeds 
Paul Warnke in the ambass-
adorial post. 

York , 57, received his 
doctorate in physics from the 
University of California , 
Berkeley and in 1951 he joined

The shotput and discus e\'ents were the te(1Il1 'S strongpoints as 
UCSD women swept both events. 

Beth Prather lead the string of indh'idual Triton \'ictories with 
first place finishes in three of the five e\'ents she entered. Wins 
came in the 100 meter hurdles (17.2),100 meter d<lsh (13.6). and the 
long jump (14 feet. II ~ inches) . Prathel' placed second in the 200 
meter run <lnd tied for third in the high jump. 

Shere Lilley, a volleybull player turned Ir<lck competitor, also 
pluced high for the Tritons in field events. Lilley swept the javelin. 
shotpul, and discus. Her winning discus throw of 124 feet was 28 
feet further than the second place thl'Ow. 

In the shotput. Lilley was followed by Kathy Washington and 
Renee Scott. The sume threesome prevailed in the discus. 

'Tm really pleased with the success of OUI' field e\'ents so [ar," 
Parnell remarked, "We've got some newcomers to the sport and 
they a re progressing very well," 

Both Lilley's and Prather's efforts were reflective of the team' 
performunce as a whole. "The amount of talent on this team 
makes me feel humble," commented Coach GI-ahlllll Parnell . 
"Their depth ,and strength is really amazing, We still could usc 
mOI-e sprinters. though, especially a good 400 metel' runner." 

The field e\'ent wins made up [or the Triton' slow finishes in 
relay e\'ents, Claremont-Mudd won both the 400 meter and 1600 
meter relays , 

Considering the number of event each team member 
participated in, the outlook for the rest of the seaon look 
optimistic. Bridget Bohan \I'on both the 1500 and 800 meter run ' , In 
the longel', 5000 meter run Sarah Rankin breezed by with an easy 
first pllice finish (19: 48) , ol'er four minutes faster thun the 
Claremont-Mudd runners , 

"I didn't know how our team would stack up against 
competition. but now I know. We'\'c got a [ew things to work on, but 
we ' re doing well." As soon as a few eligibility problems 0.11'

enamored of the idea of te lling

what to do and when to do it. 
Just as Cyrus thinks he's laid 
the foundation for an 
unconquerable army of youth.

Hill drops the interesting

ATSS 
Costs

(Continued from page 4) 
SOIllC havc chargcd thc A TSS 

billing systclll with bt'ing 
·· unfair. " 

Ac<:ordi ng to SCilstrom. cach 
lIe custolllcr is billcd on il 20',j 
randolll sampling basis. Onc of 
cvcry ('i,'c calls. thc(lrctit-ally. 
arc Illonitorcd for billing. Thc 
call is then multiplicd by rivc to 
account for tht' rClllaining /10'1, 
of thc phonc calls. Scustrolll 
cxplaincd. 

UCLA. C Bcrkclcy. and ue 
Irvinc Mcdical School havc 
adoptcd il 100'." billing plan 
which. Scastrom said. "is 
bcttcr ... thcrc·s no qucstion 
about it. " 

According to eampb~lI. 
eSD will soon implement 

such a billing plan. "It should 
bc very cost-cHcctivc." hc 
notcd . 

Thc rcmaining C schools 
"all havc programs to do it in 
thc future," Campbclf added. 

Long rcmarked that a "Itlg 
limc with rccciving bills " has 
also madc cost asscs:ments 
difficult. " Billing is two or 
threc months aftci' thc event." 
she said. 

Efficiency of A TSS is another 
targct of compluints. Brooks 
White. a UCLA Telecommuni-
cations officer, said that " my 
personal imprc 'sion is thut it 
(ATSS) is not cfficicnl.. .and is 
wasteful. " 

Brooks explained that ATSS 
has prcscntcd transitional 
difficulties. "c ros ·- tulk " 
problems . cxccssive noise on 
the lines. and ovcr-Ioaded 
telcphonc circuits. 

Tht' Futun-
Voric 'aid that "technically 

wc could switc h back" to the 
ITS systc m if ncccssa ry . 

But hc notcd that Lhe 
Lcgis luture has "thc financial 
Icvcl' ovcr us." 

" I\ 's like walking a tight-
rope." said Voric. " If it's a 
small amount of Illoncy. no one 
would probably bothcr with it." 

" It 's not just a mattcr of 
rcason and logic. " Vorie 
rcnwrkcd.
