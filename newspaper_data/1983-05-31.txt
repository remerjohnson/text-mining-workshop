AS Council Debates Allocation of 
$60,000 to Student Organizations 

With our fee" increasing yearly, 
many students wonder where exactly 
their money goes. One place is to fund 
student organizatIOns at LJCSD. 

The Associated tudents' (A ') 
budget for student organizations this 
year is $60,000 and it is currently being 
allocated to organizations for the next 
academic year. The allocation of the 
AS budget is a timeconsumingprocess 
that AS officers have been engaged in 
for the last week or so. 

Some of the orgamzaLions thaL ha\e 
traditionally received large sums of 
money are LAGO, the Ski Club, the 
Black' Student Union, Dark Star, and 
the Chll1ese Students llnion. AS 
Programmmg also recpives a lot of 
money \\ hlch should be in the 
neigh borhood of $:30,000 for t he ~J·H~ 
academ IC year. 

It \\ as argued at the AS Meeting last 
Weclne ... day tha t more money ... hould be 
put Into ... t udent organizations, i n ... tead 
of the A: Programming Budget , 
because AS Programming rarely 
gathers more than 500 students 
together at one time. One Council 
member felt that. "The organizations 
just are not getting enough money." 

The Paperwork 
When an organization applies for 

funding from the AS, they apply for 
fund s in two areas. One is the 
organization's operating expenses, 
whi le the other is program ,or special 
events. The AS budget also reserves 
some money for events sponsored by a 
few student organizations together. 

Organizations apply for money by

first having four members ..,ign forms 
stating what t} pe of organization they 
are and how many members are 
involved. Then the registration forms 
are completely filled out and an advisor 
reviews all forms and OK's Lhe 
organization for funding if they prcl\"e 
to be valid. The orgamzatlOn Lhen 
completes t he budget request forms 
that are reviewed by the ActIVIty 
Board.

Another Try 

During the second and thIrd \veeb 
of the next school year, budget 
requests will be reevaluated and 
money will be allocated for the entire 
school yea r. 

Erik Roede , activities Tee 
commiss ioner said, "When we are 
deciding how much money to give an 
organization, we take Int o 
co ns ideration the validity and 
objective of the organizations as well 
as the organization's pre vious 
financial hIstory - such as whether or 

not the\ have ..,ta,cd withIn theIr

the mone\." 

The "obJect I\'t' of the organll.atl()n" 
is analvzed to determine ho\\ mam

officers are undergraduates. Another 
consIderatIOn IS the impact of tht'

The Question of The California Review 
The Stand on Rape The Review Responds-
Editor: 

It is an indisputable fact 
that rape is an extremely grave 
problem, both here at UCSD 
and in society in general. To 
quote statistics, three out of 
four women in the US can 
expect to be sexually assaulted 
in their lifetimes. Despite this, 
the California Review, in its 
May issue, published the 
following editorial comment: 
The sexual liberation 
movement scored allOther 
victory on March 6th in New 
Bedford, Massachusetts whe,! 
six brave melt in an effort to 
break down taboos, inhibiliol1.S, 
and selfrepressimt, gang raped 
a woman in Big Dan's Tavern 
while patrons watched and 
cheered, showing that they 100 
were liberated. 

It is frightening that this is 
the position that the California 
Review chooses to take on gang 
rape. To say that gang rape is 
nothing to be laughed at is to 
state what should be obvious. 
On May 18, the A Council 
pas se d unanimously a

To Recieve AS Funds?-
Editor: 

[ would like to draw 
student' attention to the 
Associated Students meeting 
this coming Wednesday 
evening at which the AS 
Council will consider a 
proposal to grant the 
previously off -c ampus 
California Review $4,500 of 
student funds. Many students 
have found the views of the 
R eview abhorrent and 
offensive; yet as long as they 
fall short of libel and illegal 
extreme, they do have their 
right to free speech . What I 
would like toquestion, though , 
is whether we, as tudents, 
wish to fUlid this organizat ion .

typesetting machine that the 
AS already owns and operates 
for the alternative media. To 
compare, the ~lew indica lor 
spends about $50 on 
typesetting and layout using 
the AS equipment, one tenth of 
the Review's costs. The Review 
is estimating that it will spend 
$5,500 through the year for 
layout and typesetting of ten 
issues. If they used the AS 
equipment at $50 an issue, 
they would spend a total of 
$500 and save $5,000 - more 
than they are reque!>ting from

The UCSD Sacred Lunch Hour 
Editor: 

The sacred hour. 
It occurs at LTCSD every clay 

between hIgh o<xm and one. 
Over half of the vit al, UCSD 
staffed , servIces avai lable to 
s tudents on this campus are 
closed - all at the same time. 
When one is a student in need 
of assis tance, on a hectic, tight 
schedule, thIS sacred hour is 
quite an inconvenience. 

Why can 't they staggertheir 
lunch hours so that at least 
one person is available at the 
lunch hour? Students have 
classes, meetings and labs to 

!>chedu Ie their lunches around. 
We very rarely can enJoy the 
regularity of always eating 
before it is even dinner time. 
And we don 't get paid for It. 

Often the time a s tudent has 
to find out their financial 
si tuation, pa y fees, get a 
department stamp, get needed 
academic counselIng, or even 
emergency psyc hological 
services, is limited to the hour 
when all of the employees of 
these servi ces are out to eat. 

I was in a hurry between 
cla 5se~ and went out of my 
wav to get to the coun ~eling 

and psychological service!> to 
inquire about taking a career 
mtere'> t tesl. Before I opened 
my mouth I was greeted with 
" I don't know who sent you 
but you aren't supposed to be 
here until after one." There 
were several employees s itting 
there reading magazines, and I 
cou ldn 't even ask a 'question . 
What if I had had a real need to 
speak to a counselor? Are these 
people here to serve the 
student s? What do they get 
paid for? 

r won't even bring up the 
please turn tu page" 

Editor: 
We at the California Rel'iew 

wou ld like to let the AS know 
that we deplore them as much 
as they deplore u . Anybody 
who has the audacity to claim 
that we support" rape or that 
our satire makes light of rape 
is a true fool. unredeemed by 
any sense of modesty. Have 
they never read Swift nor 
Twain nor Mencken? Have 
they never read us? Have they 

We . .. deplore 
(the AS) as much 
as they deplore 
us .. 

never read anyth ing? 
California Review has 
suported that good old -
fashioned repressive morality 
of the days when men kept 

their zippers up and when sex 
was neither seen nor heard . It 
is the liberalization of sexual 
morays , the loosening of our 
moral code, and the flood of 
pornography that has done 
more to encourage rape than 
anythi ng else. We have 
defended court liness, chivalry, 
and cha tity in almost every 
issue of California Review, It is 
our ethos. Unlike the new 
indicator, we have not lauded 
the power and the glory of 
orgies. Unlike LAGO, we have 
not removed sex from its 
reproductive function. And 
unlike the AS, we care more 
about exposing thephilosophes 
responsible for human misery 
than for making cheap, 
ludicrous, unfounded, and 
ideologically motivated 
denunciations . With love ...

Rhythm speaks' the language 
of the soul and It i ... perhaps as

I,a\'e to learn to appreCIate 
rhythm as It is with lh from 
the begmnlllg In Ihe IllU,.,IC of 
our own beating hearts. 

Rock 'n roll IS an Intellsel\' 
rhythmic Illusic. The beat (if 
thedrum line is the foundation 
on which this music is built. 
We do Illore than just hear 
rock music, \\'l' l'\perience It. 
In order for the full impact of 
t his musIc to be felt, which IS 
eVer\ mUSIcian's Intended 
re.,uit, It IS Important that thIs 
music be played loud . Rock 'n 
roll at a 10\\ \ olume loses Its 
power because I he rhythms 
are no longer tangible and we 

don't l Ibra te along with it. 
Quiet rock doesn 't shake me

professional ," said one GSC 
member. " In order for me to 
become a professional. the 
focus of my life has to be on my 
department . or I'll sacrifice my 
livelihood." 

At the meeting, Watson 
recognized the GSC's need. 
However, philosophically , he 
was concerned "with 
generating satellite '" to the 
Student Center, as opposed to 
an intergrated campus that a 
University Center could 
provide. 

"J( you set a precedent , 
things begin to spin off. " said 
Watson. He also said that the 
GSC would have to indicate 
what their special needs are so 
that another ~tudent group 
could not do the same thing 
merely becuse I hev were a 
special interest group. 

The Student Center Board 
will debate the issue . But in 
the end, Watson said, "It 
becomes my decision. Bu t if I 
disapprove, I should be willing 
and able to explain it." 

For their L982-83 budget. the 
GSC received $4500 from the 
Student Center (representing 
6% of their fees). which must 
be used specifica lly for lounge 
improvements, plus $7043 
from vendi ng maching 
revenue . Thei I' proposed 
budget for L983·84 is $43.849. 
with $36,806 coming from 50')(1 
of their Student Center fees. 

The GSC would like the 
$4500 freed for general use 
becau e lounge improvements 
wi ll not benefit a ll graduate 
student s, as some depart· 
ment . have not allocated space 
for a lounge. 

"We' re not asking for 
anythi ng ridicu lou s," said 
Gonzalez. "The University is 
centered around undergrad· 
uates. We just want to be 
trea ted f ai rly ." 

Affirmative 
continued from page 5 
increase in its s tudent 
population, it is awarded a 
number of these FTE faculty 
positions. This program has 
been succes ·f u I, and ot her UC 
campuses have adopted 
similar programs. 

Another affirmative action 
program at UCSD is based on 
$55,000 a year in grant money 
the campus receives from the 
legis lature. For the past eight 
years this program ha;-, aimed 
at helping minority and female 
profes!>ors. who. becau'ie of 
their unique positwn ;-" are 
!-oought out by st udent s and 
campus committees for ad\'lce, 
and thu s, have this added 
burden to their academic 
workload . 

A competil ion exish among 
all assistant profe~~()rs for the 
funds but those found most 
worthy for the grants hve 
alway,; been minOrity and 
female professors. Eight to ten 
assistant professors receive 
these funds each year. 
DiUiculties for Women 
Staffers 

Sexual discrimination has 
certainly played a role in the 
sma ll number of fema le 
professors. but more than 
that. the fa ct exists that there 
are si mply a small er numberof

European Travel-----------------

London: Pleasin~ All 
By JAMES RALPH PAPP Slufr Writer 

Of the two letters that the 
features section ha s inspired 
in its readers thi " quarter, one 
complained that we were too 
civilized and th e ot her th at we 
were not civilized enough. The 
second had as its subject Scot 
Hoads' cont ribut ion to our 
European travel series, a tale 
of getting food poisoning in 
Mand and disgorging the 
perpetrator (canned food) in 
the tour bus while rlri \ ing past 
what may quite possibly have 
been the Prado. The letter 
writer called Scot the Ugly 
American, although any 
American , ugl ~ or beautiful , 
knows that any episode of 
foreign travel inevitably 
involves getting ick to the 
extent that it cea 'es to matter 
to one whether the surroun· 
ding buildings are or are not 
the Prado. At any event . what I 
sha ll do in this article is 
com promise. thus pleasing 
everyone (or. as the case may 
be, displeasing everyone). Just 
before lea vi ng London la t 
Christmas I went to the 
Georgian Room of Harrods 
(Art Deco Georgian) for th e 
buffet afternoon tea and ate 
nin e different kinds of 
pastries. I felt comprehen · 
sively ill afterwards (for those 
who do not like civilizat ion), 
but I went to feel ill in the 
Wedgwood room of my club in 
Mayfair , which is housed in a 
building about 250·years·old 
which ha~ belonged to the 
usual succe~sion of duchesses. 
dukes. ea rls and so fort h (for 
those who like civilization). 

However, Lonclon offers 
more t han nine different k1l1ds 
of pastnes. There are thirt) or 
forty plays running at any 
tllne, and ticket s for a good 
number of them can be had at 
half price within several hours 
of performance time, matinee 
or evening. from a green and 
yellow ticket Ix)oth in the 
middle of Leicester Square. 
This enables one to gl.'l the 

best seats for ten dollars or 
less. At the regular price such 
a sum of money would land one 
in a row where if anyone 
wants to shift the pOSition of 
hi s legs everyone has to, and in 
a seat <designed for Victorians 
whose growth had been 
stunted from bad nutrition ) 
where one has to keep one's 
feet on tiptoe to keep one's 
knees a\()Iding the back of the 
seat ahead. One is then 
literall) in no posit ion to enjoy 
the play. 

Play s a re , of cou rse,

unless one IS a millionaire or 
has had the digesti\ e system 
surgically replaced by cast 
iron it is advisable to eat as 
little as possible in England. 
Real food is expensive, and 
what the average res taurant 
serves would in America.

The Rec Center Will Open 
- But Not as Soon as You Think 

Due to the complexities of everyday bureaucracy and contractual 
delays, UCSO's Recreation Center will not be opening thi 
Wednesday as reported in last Thursday's Guardian, so don't ru sh 
down with your swimming suits and towels just yet. While 
construction is nearly finished, some safety details need to be dealt 
with before the structure can open for business. This should be 
taken care of within the next week or two, and as soon as we find 
out, you']) find out.

Press burger, who is spoken of 
with a tone of the awe of

discusses th e architecture and
