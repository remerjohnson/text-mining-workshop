Sloan Research Fellowships. recognizing their out-
standing work as young scientists and economists. 

The reCipients are Robert E. Continetti, an assis· 
tant professor of chemistry and biochemistry; DimitTi 
Basov. assistant professor of physics; William R. 
Schafer. assistant professor of physics; and Kate 
Okikiolu. assistant professor of mathematiCs. 

Continetti 's research concerns the chemistry and 
the environmental ramifications of ozone destruction. 

Basov IS conducting experiments on electron trans· 
port in novel materials. His 0 her research includes 
studies on exotic conductors and superconductors 
uSing new spectroscoPIc techniques. 

Schafer is fOCUSing on the specific molecular pathways 
operating in individual neurons of a nervous system. 

Oklklolu IS working on several proJects. but is best 
known for her work With eiliptieal·differential operators. 

The Sloan Research Fellowship Program is 42 
years old and has supported the work of over 3.200 
researchers. The program distributes $35.000 to 
each fellow over a two-year period.

U CSD Retenion Rates Rank 
Second Highest in UC System Now ENROLLING: SAN DIEGO'S #1 COURSE FOR THE 
CLASSES: Wat on 
wants to focu on 
improving social life 
By Eric Brace 
Staff Wnter 

Nearly XO percent of UCSD', 
fre, hm.:n ultimately graduatc from 
the uni versity. according \0 a new 
report by the Oflice of Student 
Research and Information. 

While administrators ,ay 
UCSD's academic resources pro-
vide its students with the opportu-
nities to complete their degrees. the 
Office of Student Affairs hopes to 
raise UCSD's graduaton 'rate by 
introducing programs designed to 
improve the campus's social life 
and racial atmosphere. 

According to the Apri l 1997 
" Retention and Graduation Rates" 
report. UCSD ranks second in the 
UC system in graduating a high 
percentage of the student body' and 
redul:ing the number o f students 
who drop out or transfer. 

UCSD graduated 77.3 percent 
of its 19119 freshmen dass. which 
allowed the class six years 10 com-
plete their degrees. while 73 .9 per-
cent and 45.0 percent of the 1990 
and 1991 classes graduated in live 
and four years, respecti vely. 

The only campus to exceed 
UCSD 's graduation rates in all 
thrce classes is UC Berkeley. 

Joseph Watson. vice chancellor 
of student a/fairs. said the campus 
shou ld take pride in the recent 
report . which shows UCSD to be 
an establi,hed al:adel11ic institution

6 OPINION •• The ·UCSI) Guardian Thursday. June ,5. 19091 , 

COMMENTARY: An increase in mergers between primary media companies, though protested by many 
academics as being dangerous to democracy, will not decrease the companies' diversity or public accountability 

CONSOLIDATION KEEPS THE MEDIA EFFICIENT 
By John Murphy 
Managing Editor 

The '9Os have been marked by a 
~eries of huge mergers. and some 
of the most notable have been in 
media. With any merger. the first 
consideration of government regu-
lators and the genera l public is 
whether the perceived economic 
benefits of the merger outweigh the 
possible anti -competiti ve results. 

Consolidation within the media 
industry presents regulators with an 
additional task: They arc forced to 
rule not on ly whether the proposed 
merger is anti -l:Ompetitive. but 
whether the power to gather and 
dis emi nate the new~ can be 

entru~ ted to an industry w ntai ning 
one less member. 

Apparent ly. regu lators arc not 
very concerned about the hltest 
,erles of mergers. having recently 
approved Di~ney Corp.'s pun;hase 
of Capi tal Itics/ABC and Time 

Warncr'~ pUf(.: ha~e of Turner 
Broadcasting. L l kewl~e . the public 
ha~ accepted the Illergers with lill ie 
COl1l lm:nt and no prote~l. 

Many acade I11l c~ . on the 'other 
hand. have vo iced their oppositIOn 
to the deab. critu.:it.ing c(Jn~olida ­
tion within the industry a~ danger-
ou, to delllocracy. What these 
myopic academics fail to see is the 
dynamic nature of the media indus-
try and capita li sm in general. The 
general puhl ic shou ld not be con-
cerned ahnut media mergers. for 
they merely reOect ever-changing 

market w nd itions and the rapid 
advancement of communications 
technology. 

If anything, media is more 
diverse today than it has ever been. 
At the turn of the century. people's 
media choices were limited to a 
few local newspapers. Most news-
papers had a distinctly provincial 
scope. relying on a few news agen-
cies for national and international 
news. 

Today. American~ can choose 
from a myriad of media types and 
news sources. With six networks 
(fi ve of which have major news-
gathering divisions), hundreds of 
cable channeb, several newspaper~ 
and magal-i nes with national di~tri ­
but ions and a whole uni ve r~e of 
local newspaper. television and 
radio provider~ . the puhlic ha~ 
never been more inundated with 

new~ and information . 
Instead of bei ng confined to the 
dl~cus~ion of local i,we~. 
Amencan, have ava ilable to them 
up-lO-the-lOstanl ncw~ and opml n 
I rom acf()~~ the nallon and around 
the world . 

Such a Widespread sharing of 
thought and information not onl y 
makes economic transaction, that 
much more ef'fi cient. hut il also 
keeps those interested informed -
a prerequi site of any participatory 
form of government. 

In addi tion. media groups wi th 
worldwide resources help tic the 
world together. In 50 years, few 

UCSD 

distribute multiple media formats 
to ever-growing audiences. The 
huge re ources nceded to establish 
worldwide news-gathering agen-
cies encourage some consolidation. 

It would not be economically 
., efficient. or even feasib le. for every 

I ~ little town to have its own organi-.• zation capable of global activi ty. 
Likewise. it is not economically 
efficient for news-gathering agen-

Who really care. If a 
few companies 
dominate television 
and print when 
information can be 
disseminated almost 
effortle .. ly by 
anyone with access 
to a computer? 
will mourn the pa"mg 01 provln -
(;ial attitude~ . We arc moving 
toward a trul y glonal society in 
which idea~ arc freel y exchangcd 
net ween different (; ultures. To 
block con\olidation wlthllllllcdia I, 
to stand III the way of thiS tran;,l -
ti on. 

Consolidati on is the direct result' 
of the globali zati on of nwdia. To 
compete in today's market. media 
providers must have the capita l. 
hoth human and financia l. to cover 
events allover the world. and to 

cies to be demarcated along medi a 
lines. Diversification across media 
lines a llow~ purchasers to sc lect the 
media type that best meets their 
needs and is the best provider. 

I ncreased government regu I a-
tion and control of media would 

po~e a greater threat to democracy 
than would further industry consol-
idation. Currently. media provider, 
are beholden to tens of thousands 
of sponsor~ . The risk of sponsors ' 
having undue innuence over the 
media indu stry's programmin g 
deci,ions is mitigated by the huge 
number of ~ponsors . No single 
sponsor can make or break a media 
company. or gain much influence 
over edi torial content. 

Even mighty General Motors, 
the biggest corporation in the world 
and one of the biggc,t advertisers. 
is not free from media scrutiny -
just recall the extensive coverage 
of the safety concerns over side-
mounted fuel tanks on GM tru~ks. 

Government control or owner-
ship reverse this trend: Instead of 
bei ng able to diversify the risk of 

alienating a sponsor across thou-
sands of companies. media compa-
nies would be beholde'1 to one enti-
ty. the government. Such a concen-
tration of power. especially in an 
entity that can make and enforcc 
laws. would be di sastrous . 

The ri sk of control over the 
media falling into the hands of gov-
ernments should rightly scare all 
those who fear authori tarianism. 
One only needs to read George 
Orwell's /984 to get a taste of what 
the nationalization of media might 
effect. 

Clearly. control or the media in 
the hands of as few as four or Ii ve 
giants would be preferable to gov-
ernment ownership or control. 
Competition at least keeps media 
com panic;, accotlntable - if a 
compan y loses credi bility .. it will 
lose viewers to its competitors. 

The idea that an industry domi -
nated by four or five giants would 
limit expression is severely nawed. 
Obviou;, ly. a diversity or opinion 
and experience exists within any 
large group of people. Corporations 
are no different ; contrary to popu -
lar belief, they are not monoli lhic 
entities intent on global domina-
tion. 

ews and other media arc pro-
duced th rough the co llaboration of 
hundreds of thousands of peoplc. 
To think that all these voices would 
be silenced by a ehange in corpo-
rate structure is preposterous. That

evening To the studio 
executives) they are 
the dtfference 
between Cl power 
lunch or a McDon-
ald's lunch. Whatever 
the ca e may be) take 
a look at the mo t 
anticipated movie oj 
the summer. 

THE LOST 
WG r-D 
If you haven't been to "The Lost World" 
yet, you're one of the few ThiS triP takes 
the audience to yet another Island (con-
venlentlyoverlooked In the first "Jurasslc 
Park") that IS once again Infested With 
dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg has collabo-
rated With Industria l Light & MagiC, the 
same team that brought us the special 
effects from the first " JurassIc Park." Star 
Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) says, "As 
real as the dinosaurs looked In the fi rst 
one, they're even more real thiS time 
around." If thiS movie doesn't gross $200 
million, It Will be conSidered a disap-
pointment. 

Schwarzenegger trades in his grenade 
launcher for an Icicle-shooter In th iS latest 
installment of the now-campy Batman 
series. George Clooney becomes the 
third man to don the Batsuit. Does the 
suit fit? Chris O'Donnell reprises his role 

as the fast talking, orphaned Dick 
Grayson/Robin AliCia Silverstone hopes 
that her performance as Batglrllsn 't clue-
less while Uma Thurman makes you want 
catch POison Ivy. It seems that Warner 
Bros . spent so much money on the cast 
and cos tumes, they forgot to come up 
With a decen t Script. Nevertheless, thiS 
bat Will fly high at the box office. 

Jan De Bont returns as Director for th iS 
boat ride from hell. Keanu Reeves 
dropped out of this sequel to tour with 
hiS band Dogstar, and Sandra Bullock 
now wants to learn how to drive a ship. 
Same basic plot as the first movie - sub-
stitute ship for bus, Willem Dafoe for Den-
nis Hopper and Jason Patrlc for Keanu 
Reeves. ThiS ship should not have set sail. 

CON 
M 

r 
\ 

Nicolas Cage, John Malkovlch, John 
Cusack and Vlng Rhames power thiS 
testosterone-filled action flick. The plot 
takes audiences onto an airplane full of 
shackled ConViCts who hijack the plane 
and take it In for landing on the Las Vegas 
Strip. Jerry Bruckhelmer, producer ot "The 
Rock," says, "The movie is really an 
Odyssey of Nic trying to go home and 
see hiS wife and child . It's very romantic" 
Like "The Rock," thiS film Will surely bene-
fit from Its massive star talent. 

This latest Disney-animated feature is hop-
Ing to re-galn the audiences that were lost 
on the dark "Hunchback of Notre Dame." 
Adapted from the classic Greek Mytho-
logical character, Hercu les has been "Dls-
ney-fied " and given a sense of humor. 
James Woods prOVides the voice for the 
devil (that's Hades to all you kids out 
there) and has fun tormenting our hero. 
According to an animator, "Herc sort of 

I 

Thursday. June 5. 1997 

becomes the Michael Jordan of Greece, 
which In some ways IS based on reality." 
Disney can be sure that millions of kids 
Will pay to see thiS one, as well asfor their 
Hercules lunch box, sword, hat, shirt, 
doll , mouse pad, watch and cape. 

DESPERATE 
M[AGUR 5 
Michael Keaton switches from making us 
laugh to becoming a murderous prison 
escapee. "It took Keaton a li ttle while to 
click Into hiS Character," says Director Bar-
bet Schroeder. This plot l\Nists to find 
Keaton as the only man who can give 
Andy Garcia's son a bone-marrow trans-
p lant. Unfortunately, Keaton Isn't thrilled 
With the Idea and chooses to break out 
of prison and lead Garcia and the rest of 
the City on a chase.·Unless you don't 
have a pulse or you've been suck In the 
head by an old delivery ruck, thiS film 
has to affect you," Keaton says 

MEN IN 
I .~K 
Will Smith goes up against aliens again, 
this time with Tommy Lee Jones as his 
partner in crime. Smith and Jones are 
top-secret, dark-suited government 
agents who police extra-terrestrial visita-
tionS. Based on the popular comic b<rl. 
of the same name, this film is fil led with 
humor. "I have been a little successful 
With July 4th weekends," Smith says, "so I 
am feeling pretty confident these days." 
These men In black may give the Jurassic 
reptiles a run for their money. 

12~CL:SS 
BAGGAGE 
In Alicia Silverstone's prodUCing debut, 
she plays a spoiled rich kid who makes a 
plan to kidnap herself. Along the way she 
runs into Vincent (Benicio Del Toro), an 
unsuspecting car thief, who is drawn into 
the kidnapping. While on the run, she is 
tracked down by ex-CIA assaSSin, Uncle 
Ray (Christopher Walken), who IS hoping 
to return her t6 her father. If audiences 
like Alicia as Batgirl , It might help make 
thiS movie a success. 

MMfC 
This is one of those late-night, sci -fi, at-
home-all-alone horror movies that tem-
porarily scare~ the bejeebers out of you. 
The film StNS t ,~ira Sorvino as a brilliant 
scientist. SOIVino and her husband (Jere-
my Northam) are forced to fight against a 
dangerous species of human-like insects 
(otherwise known as aliens). Taking after 
the film's title, these tricky little suckers 
learn to camouflage themselves and look 
like humans. $orvlno calls the $25 million-

The U SO Guardian 

horror film's tone "oppressive and beauti -
fu l." Let's hope that this horror delivers 
the same scares that Mlramax's last horror 
film, "Scream,· did. 

AIR FORCE Orr.E 
From the director who brought us "In the 
Line of Fire" and "Das Boot" comes an 
action and talent-packed thrill -ride Ham-
son Ford (better known as Han Solo) was 
paid a handsome $20 million for hiS role 
as the PreSident. Gary Oldman once again 
plays an Incredibly scary bad guy and 
Glenn Close becomes the first female 
Vice PreSident on-screen Wolfgang Pe er-
son, the film's director says, "If It was Bill 
ClInton up there, he 'd be In trouble But 
thiS IS Hamson Ford. He can be very con-
vincing as a PreSident and an action 
hero." With all thiS talent, thiS film IS a 
must see - unless you're on a plane. 

The amazing Jim Henson Productions 
brings us thiS true story based on the life 
of Gertrude Lintz, a 1920s socialite who 
raised gorillas and chimpanzees as her 
ovvn children. Rene Russo, who portrays 
Lintz, found her character difficult at first: 
"I've never had a cat. Birds I can relate to, 
and I've been bitten twice by monkeys, 
so I have to admit, I read the Script and I 
went, '1 don't think so,'" ThiS film IS per-
fect for audiences who don't like the 
senseless Vio lence offered by the other 
summer releases. 

Robert Zemeckis ' last outing brought us 
"Forrest Gump." Now Zemeckis is pairing 
Jodie Foster with Matthew McConaughey 
- she is an astronomer and he is her 
government advisor. Foster receives a 
message from, yes - you guessed it, 
aliens. The dilemma arises when she gets 
Instructions from the other world. Sci-
ence, religion and politics all playa part 
in this summer release. With ZemeckiS at 
the helm, this film promises to break the 
summer mold. 

This is gOing to be the movie that you 
won't want to miss The extraordinary 
ensemble cast Includes Robert De Nlro, 
Harvey Keitel, Sylvester Stallone, Ray Llot-

ta and Janeane Garafolo. Stallone put on 
30 pounds of fat to play the sweet-
natured, Gump-like Freddy Heflin. The 

pro~lems start when a bunch of NYPD 
officers settle In an otherwise qUiet New 
Jersey tovvn. Next thing they know some 
innocent people get killed and the inves-

• tigatlon begins. BeSides gOing to thiS 
movie to see Stallone 's new bod, one 
should go for an intense m no e mono 
bel\Neen De Nlro and Keitel. Watch for 
this film come Oscar time. 

CONSPIRACY 
Trf GRY 
Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts team up In 
thiS Oliver Stone-esque story about a 
Manhattan cab driver (Gibson) who 
thinks NASA IS gOing to kill the PreSident 
by creating an earthquake Roberts plays 
an Intelligent district attorney who ends 
up belieVing Gibson and falling in love 
With him. Directed by Richard Donner (of 
the "Lethal Weapon" series), this movie 
doesn 't involve aliens. But it does look 
like It will be a good break from the 
other speCial effects-loaded summer 
releases . 

Mdltln Lawrence picks the wrong day to 
carJack Tim Robbins In thiS comedy about 
two guys who are haVing a bad day. 
Director Steve Oedekerk ("Ace Ventura 
2") loved working With such different 
actors: "It was great seeing these two 
guys together. They had absolutely noth-
Ing In common." According to Robbins, 
much o f the SCript was Improvised- "We 
were gOing out Without a net every time." 
With two hilariOUS actors and a funny 
director, this movie might be the sum-
mer's comedy hit . 

~II 
"Boogie Nights" is a story about the '70s 
porno industry that reSided in Los 
Angeles . "Marky Mark" Wahlberg is the 
star of this retro "shagfest," and for all 
you ladles out there he will not be 
wearing hiS Calvlns. Director Paul 
Thomas Anderson hopes that people 
don't get the wrong idea about the 
film 's graphic nature: "If the movie IS 
clear in what irs about, hopefully It 
won 't be misinterpreted." The film IS 
stili fighting With the MPAA for an "R" 
rat ing Instead of the "NC-17" it had

HIATUS HI9 

John Travolta plays an FBI agent who 
employs a futuristiC face-altering technol-
ogy to get revenge on Nicolas Cage. 
Director John Woo ensures that there are 
plenty of gallons of blood shed. The high-
lights include a body getting squlshed by 
a p lane and a modem-day cruCifiXion. 
WOO IS known for hiS stylized Violence, 
and thiS movie prOVides another domain 
for him In which to explore that style. 

SHE'S DE LG 
Sean Penn, Robin Wright and John Travol ta 
star In thiS romantic drama w itten by the 
late legendary director, actor and screen-
wlter John Cassavetes (" RoselTKlry's Baby, " 
"The Dirty Dozen"). Directed by Cas-
savetes' son Nick, thiS film tells the story of 
Eddie (Penn) and Maureen (Wright) as a 
young, married couple. When a neighbor 
attacks Maureen, Eddie snaps and ends 
up losing 10 years of his life in a prison. 
Upon his release, he discO\lers another 
man (Travolta) is sleeping with his wife. 
NOVv' Maureen has to choose belVv'een an 
inexplicable passion and an abiding love. 

MY BEST FRIEND'S 
:DfJIN 

For those who have fallen out of love with 
the Pretty Woman, this IS the movie that IS 
supposed to re-ignlte that flame. Julia 
Roberts' character makes a pact with her 
best friend, played by Dermot Mulroney, 
that If both of them are not married to 
other people by the age of 2B, they will 
marry each other. Of course, Mulroney 
spoils the plan and gets engaged to 
another pretty woman, Cameron Diaz. 

CAREER G:Rf-S 
In his follow up to the award-Winning 
·Secrets and Lies," Writer-Director Mike 
Leigh goes for a comedic departure, pair-
ing two 30-year-old university-misfits-
turned-working girls. The two women, 
played by Katnn Cartlidge and Lynda 
Steadman, spend a weekend reminiSCing 
about their school days and bumping into 
their former classmates. Leigh's talent for 
realistic dialogue in realistic situations Will 
undoubtedly shine through in this film.

MOVING ON 
Whats next/or UCSD grads? 

By Genevieve Cox 
Staff Writer 

Graduating, whether from high 
schoo l or college, is an exrerience 
almOSI always accompanied by a 
wide variety of emotions. Promi-
nent among these sentiment is the 
pairing of anxiety and exci tement 
with respect to Ihe "next slep" of 
one's life. 

Diane Court, the fictional vale· 
dietorian of a high school class in 
the 1989, Iliek, "Say Anything," 
expressed those trepidations to her 
fellow graduates: 

"I have seen our future ", and all 
I can say is .. , go back!" 

UCSD's 1997 graduates, now 
en tering their final week of class, 
will face those samc looming 
visions next week when they pi ck 
up thei r diplomas and make their 
departure from (;o ll ege into the

Punk veterans still

Continued from page 20 
their mainstream, safe sociely. 

Now, everywhere you go you 
see someone with some weird hair-
do, or everyone's all "tatted" back. 
instantly cool, piereed up and dri -
vi ng around. It is dilTerenl, but now 
that I'm a little older and a little 
wiser it doesn' t bother me as much . 
I have more important things to 
worry about. 
You guys have so many 
influences that one wouldn't 
expect from a punk band, 
such as Johmy Cash and 
other country and rockabilly 
influences. How did that 
come about? 

Mainly it's Ihe fact that we feel 
this whole rebe llious punk allitude 
didn'l necessari ly stan 10 1979 or 
whalever. People have neen con-
veying Ihls ~i nce thcy' ve necn wrll -
ing music. You go back to the '30, 
and '40s and these blue, guy, an.: 
Singing about heroin and whiskey 
and women and hcartache. and you 
can tell they're singing anoul 
what 's going on in thcir real life . 
You can feelthc emotion in It. 
How do you think the com· 
mercial • success you've 
experienced has affected 
the band? 

Well . it's given us a little bit of 
stahi lity and credibil ity and stuff. 
hUI it 's nOllike we're outlhere seil -
ing millions and millions of 
records. We' re very f'onunatc to he 
able to continue on and make each 
record and be ahle to make anolher 
one after the last. For the most pan . 
we fee l that everything we ' ve done 
has necn pretty much commen.: ial -
Iy incorrect. We don ' t have a pron-
lem with that. because we just li kc 
to play musk, and if other people 
can enjoy it, th at 's gn:at. We' re not 
here to tell people how to live Ihelr 
lives or what to do with their live~. 
because we never wanted anyone 
to tell us that. 
Your sound definitely went 
against the commonplace 
hardcore bands of the early 
'80s. What was that like? 

That was one of the reasons why 
we started to get into other types of 
music as well. All o f a sudden. 
that's what was going on in the 
punk scene - it started gelling 
rea lly hardcore. There were 1,000 
bald guys screaming into a micro-
phone and all these bands who, we 
thought , were confusing tempo for 
intensity. They thot,Ight they'd have 
to play 150 beats per minute in a 
song to make it hardcore punk . 
They were missing the point that 
no mailer what the tempo of the 
song is. there can be ju~t as much 
intensity in a slow song a~ a fa~t 
~ong . It all depends on what you' re 
saying in the song. Melody and the 
musical ~core i~ great. but It come~ 
down 10 the lyrica l content. for me. 
that separates some song~ from 
others. That was kmd of why we 
started looking deeper back into 
our American roots. bccau~e we 
weren't satisfied with the direction 
the whole hardcore scene was tak-
ing. 
How does it feel to have 
bands label you as "an influ· 
ence" now? 

It, feels good, but for the most 
part I don't really think about it too 
much. I hear it and it's a compli -
ment, hut that 's what you do. you 
think about it for two 'econds 
before you start thinking about 
something else. 

CROWES: 
Band backed away 
from spotlight 
Continued from page 20 
record which boasted the hit singles 
"Hard To Handle" and "She Talh 
to Angels." The album proved to be 
huge, immediately propelling the 
band into the spot light. 

"We were selling more albums 
per month than [ would have ever 
though the record would have 
done in its entirety," drummer 
Steve Gorman told the Guardian. 

As any band might do after a 
hit record, The Black Crowcs took 
to the road in support of the 
album. opening for former Lcd 
Zeppelin front man Robert Plant 
on hi "Manic irvana" Tour. 

It was at thi s point that the band 
realized it was time to shift gear~ 
and begin focu~ing more on ib 
live sho\\ . 

"People bought our lirst record 
after it had been out for a 'car and 
then came to see us," Gorman s'lId. 
"I think they were reall I ~urpmed 
hy the hand they saw. and we wer~ 
moving away from that a~ qUickl y 
a;, po;, ible . Our whole point wa, 
to get to he a great live hand." 

The .U,CSD·Guardiao· 

Following Shake YOLlr Money-
maker, the subsequent releases of 
The SOLlfhern Harmoll." alld Mllsi-
cal Companion (1992) and amori· 
ca ( 1994) proved that the band 
was indeed versatile and able to 
move on. The Sowhenr Harmoll." 
featured more of a gospel-inspired 
sound. while CI/IIoriclI - thc 
hand 's best eflort - was recorded 
during a time when the Robinson 
brothers were feuding, almost 
causi ng the band to break up. The 
result of those mtemal conllicts 
produced a more introspective, 
darker sound. outlined with gohs 
of juicy Latin percussion. 

Together, the three albums so ld 
over II million copies. Last year's 
71Iree Sllakes (wd aile Charll/ 
continued that trend. even though 
the sound on each album IS vast I} 
different from that of its predeces-
sur,. 

'They're four different place,. 
times and attitude,. whidl I'm 
reall y proud of," Gorman said. 
"We've never consciousl tried to 

r\!~reate anyth ing. But we' ve ne\ er 
tried to create unythlllg clther. \\'~

The row~, hu\'l~ never ;,ought 
III maintain a Mllid lOUring s~hed -

ule in suppon of any album -
they just tour when they feel the 
time is right. The band 's li ve 
shows are a knockout punch of 
energy and power, featuring bits 
and pieces from the band's entire 
.1 I-year repertoire. 

"When we play. we don't play 
stu IT from the new record allllthen 
a little bit of the fir tone." Gonnan 
aid. "I\'s all thrown into the pot." 

Indeed, the nightly selection of 
songs is random, and sometimes 
goes undecided until minutes 
before the show. 

"E,'ery night. maybe an hour 
before the how. Chris I Robinson 1 
wi ll sit down and he pretty much 
always has an opener and closer in 
mind ." Gorman ex plained. 
"Sometime~ he' ll just write the 
whole set. If you' re silling nex t to

This year' tour is the second in 
the festi val's existence. The 
Crowes are great fans of The 
Dead. and their dreams came true 
when they opened for them in 
1995 in Tampa, Fla. . 

"After Jerry [Garcia) died, it 
wa like, T oo bad, if only w<:. 
could have toured with them ... · 
GOnllan admilled. "When Further 
came along. it was like, well that 
isn't The Dead. but it's great that 
those guys arc moving on. We kcpt 
in touch, and they were looking 
for a band for thi year's Further to 
put a different spin on it than last 
year. We sort of went to them and 
said , 'How ab ut us? Don' t even

when they said OK."

Five Crew Stars Pack Up Their Triton Oars 
SUNSET: UCSO bid farewell to Rafaat, Kogut, Page, Meyers-Woodard and Ti lley, a group of seniors who have carried the 
men 's and women 's crew squads to national recognition, leaving behind a tradition of hard work and success 
By Travis Hili 
Co-ASSOCiate Spons Editor 

How do they do It " They get up 
for praclice In the mJ(Jdle of the 
night (4:30 a.lII. LO be exact) , are on 
the water before dawn and repeat 

thi~ proce,\ \IX day~ a week . Per-
hap, the hetterquestion i\ why 
do they do it? The rea,on 1\ 

~i mple: they love 10 row. 
The ~eni o r~ of 1(1)0-97 
men'~ and women 's crew had 
the love, The ~ucce,~ they 
have enjoyed dunng their ca-
reers demonst rated ju,t how 
dedicated thi s group rea ll y 
was. 

For men 's crew member~ Kanm 
Rafaat and Greg Kogut, thi ~ ~eason 
was e~pec i a ll y sweet. These two 
outstanding rowers have seen the 
dark days of the program and almo~t 
watched its demise. 

" We decided that one of our pri -
mary goals was to he more rccog-
niled on campus," Head Coach M ike 
Fillipone ~aid . " We wanted people 
to know about UCSD crew. So we 
dec ided that one thing wou ld get us 
more recognition : 90 fast." 

And that is exactly what they 
did. With the bchind-the-,cene, 
leadership of Raf<l3t and K ogut and 
the guidance of Fillipone, CSI) 

men '~crewre ln vlgorated Itself. The 
men's Var,i ty Eight took ~cc()nd 
place at the State Champi()n~ hip, 
and thi rd at the We~tern Rl:giona l\ . 

Rafaat'\ i\ a 'pecial 'tory. In 
additIOn to bClng the mo\tuomlnant 
rower on the \quad, hc did all of it 
while applYing t\) (and getllng into) 
UCSI) Medlcaf School. He "'" re-
warded for hl~ effom on Tue\day 
night with a SI) Athlete of the 

Year award, the I lr,ttlm~ any 
membcr of men ' \ c rcw ha~ 
fI!CCI vcd \uch an honor. 

"Karim wa, an i m;redihly 
worthy reciplcnt of the 
award," Fi lIip mc .,aid. " Wc 
were really bfc, ~eu to have 
him on our team." 

Kog ut wa, abo on the 
medal-winning Var&IIY Eighttcam, 
de,pite the fact that he only hegan 
rowing In hi~ junior yea r. A fter hi ~ 
Junior ~ea~() n , he improved during 
the summer. He came hack for thiS 
,cason and turned himseff Into one 
of the rno~t powerful rower, on the 
team. H i~ contrihution ~ a~ the ,ixth 
man were crucialw thc hoat', , uc-
ces,. H is team voted hlln the Most 
Improved Rower for hi, cfforb. 

For women's crew, thi s was an-
ot her olltstanding sea,on. Lcd by 
Head Coach Jack Vallerga and hi, 
22 year, of Triton experience, the 
ladle, Lightweight Four won both 
the Ca lifornia and We,t Coa~ t 
C hamplOn' hip~ . The Var,IlY Four 
defeated top DiVision I compctlli on 
in taking the Miller Cup. 

Three \eni<m fed the charge thi ~ 
year. R()wer~ Manl.a Page, Jennifer 

Pharo Courtesy of rhe Crew ream 
Speed: The members of the Triton Varsity Eight power their way to another meda l-winning 
performance. They took second place at the State Champions hips after a rough season in 1995-96. 

M cyers-W oodard and cox,wain 
Darde Ti lIey have .11 1 becn In the 
program for four years and wit h 
varsity for thrceof them. These three 
ha ve heen th rough a lot together and 
experienced tremendous success, in-
cl uding bei ng on the Lightweight 
rour boat that went to alionab III 
1995. 

Whi le each had a different le<l<.ier-
sh ip Myle, all of them had a remark -
able work ethi c. They each had differ-
ent ro les on the team. but their person-
alities meshed incredihly well . 

Page is an amal.lng ly powerful 

rower who has m 'da lled every year 
~Inl:e her freshman sea~on . Her 
Lightweight Four hoat~ have won 
the Ca li fornia Sta te Champi on ship~ 
for three years straight. She has been 
' 0 dominant that she has been se-
lected to tryout for the women '5 

ationaltcam. Only 40 women are 
~elce t ed for thi ~ honor and Page 
hasn' t even reached her prime ye t. 

Meyers·Woodard moved up to 
the Open-weight ca tegory after her 
~ucce~~ in '95. TI~i~ i sa much toughcr 
category to wi n In, but she worked 
voraciously aL her rowing and thi~ 

yea r hcr efforts paid o fT. Her 
OpcnFour hoat won a medal at the 
Miller Cup and also won a ,i Iver 
medal at the Pacifi c Coast Rowi ng 
Championships, missing the gold

Super Senior Says Goodbye to Polo 
CHAMP: After leading the Tritons to the US A Collegiate Nationals, Shawna Cabal~ero dep~s as 
one of UCSO's most decorated water polo stars, including a second team AII-Amenca selection 
By Jonah Nlsenson 
Staff Wri ter 

When a team has a 5-1 9 record 
and more than hal f the players on it 
are fre hmen, it has become politi -
cally correct to call it a season 
of rebuilding. However, whi le 
the UCSD women 's water 
polo tea m definitely had its 
fair share of youthful mem-
bers, it maintained high aspi-
rations for achievement and 
pulled out an eighth pface fin-
i h at the USA Collegiate Na-
tional s al the University of Michi -
gan. 

In the past, UCSD has po sled 
phenomenal records with five N a-
tional Championships under its belt, 
including the most recent in 1994. 
That season happened to be present -
day senior stand -out Shawna 
Caballero ' freshman year, and not 
surprisingly she wa~ the player who 
calmly made the winning shot in the 
Cbampionship game. It is no won -

der that Caballero, a two-time cap-
tain of the team and four-year 
lellerwinner, recently earned Sec-
ond Team All -American recogni -
ti on and was named a UCSD Ath-

lete of the Year. 
" I was apprehensive abut 

the team qualifying for Na-
tionals, but Shawnaexceeded 
all my expectations in terms 
of patience and persever-
ance," Triton Head Coach 
Denny Harper said. "She was 
a major factor in why we 

qualified." 
The Tritons took one thing at a 

ti me this season and took nothing 
for granted. They were a young team 
lacking in college-level experience, 
but the players retai ned that one 
quality that ha driven them even 
when they were in the doldrums: 
heart. On topofthat , UCSD boasted 
a hole set defender, Caballero, who 
p lays as well as anyone in the game. 

In the Wes tern Qualification 

Tournament at. UC Berkeley, Ca-
ballero anchored the team as UCSD 
upset arch-rival U Davi s, a victory 
whiCh sent them to Ann Arbor, M ich, 
to compete in the ational Tourna-
ment. 

As if that weren ' t enough , the 
Tritons sent three of their four games 
into double overtime. something no 
other women 's water polo team has 
ever done. Despite only winning 
one of it four games, UCSD moved 
from ninth to eighth in the national 
rankings. 

The Tritons' victory came against 
the University of Maryland, a team 
they had lost to earli er in the season. 
With strong play from Caballero 
and freshman Dara Burch, the team 
was able to nail out a victory with a 
clutch shot in the waning minute of 
the second overtime. The other two 
overtime losses were disappointing, 
considering how the Tritons could 
have finished, but the player were 
nonetheless pleased with the one
