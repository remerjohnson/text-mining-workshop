Parking permit thefts on 
BY MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 

Staff Writer 
'Parking permits have 

become a hot item on campus. 
Nineteen permits have 

been reported stolen from. off 
of bumpers and dashboards 
since fall quarter began, 
according to Campus Police 
Sgt. Clark Martin. Seven 
reports have been filed for 
lost permits. 

One of the main problems 
the police face in dealing with 
permit thefts is that many of 
the reports the police receive 
are false, says Martin. By 
filing a false report, the 
student or staff member 
hopes to obtain a new permit 
for a friend or spouse, getti"f{ 
"two for the price of one, 
says Martin. 

Filing a false report is a 
crime, however, and the 

\. \.''''' '\0.: 

police do not hesitate to 
prosecute. 

When a report is filed, the 
police add the serial number 
of the stolen permit to a 
master tlst, which is then 
distributed to parking lot 
attendants . The stolen 
permits are almost always 
recovered, Martin claims. 

Of course, if the permit is 
recovered, the thief is usually 
caught too, says Martin. "We 
have a very successful, 
almost 100% prosecution 
rate," he boasts. 

Once out of the police's 
hands, the case is referred to 
a student committee which 
operates throu~h Campus 
Legal Services office. If 
found guilty by this 
committee, the culprit faces 
administrative punishment.

Metzger met 
neo-Nazi in SF 
Says he and Roeder 
share the same 'goals' 

State Ku Klux Klan leader Tom Metzger, 
Democratic candidate for congress in UCSD's 41st 
Di trict, acknowledged Wednesday that he had a 
secret meeting in San Diego wi th Germall nro-Nazi 
leader Manfred Roeder last July. 

"Manfred is a friend of mine and if he ever comes 
around, I'll met him again. I have a lot of ympathy 
for what he tands for in Germany," Metzger told a 
San Franci co Chronicle reporter. 

Roeder reportedly stayed in San Francisco 
during July and later moved on to Washington , DC 
and Buffalo, NY, where he talked with 
ympathisers. On Sept. 1, he secretly returned to 

West Germany, only to be immediately arrested on 
charge of "incitement to racial hatred in 
di honoring the Jewish people." 

Roeder, 51, was di barred in West Germany for 
anti-Semitic activitie . A poke man for the West 
German con ultate in an Franci co characterized 
him as a "faci t who who romanticizes the Hitler 
era. " 

Roeder heads two American group - Teutonic 
Unity in Buffalo, NY and New Order Publications 
in Lincoln, NE - that solicit money to fund hi 
organization's activities in West Germany. 

When Roeder tayed with various klan men 
while in the San Franci co area, he instructed 
them and local Nazi in the use of explo ives, a 
confidential source told the Chronicle. 

Metzger denied allegation that Roeder's group 
and the California Klan are interelated. ''I'm not a 
member of hi group and he's not a member of min, 
but individuals from my organization are free to 
receive his literature and keep in touch with him. 
That' why I had no qualms about having them 
(Klan members) put him up for a night or feeding 
him while he was in the bay area," Metzger said. 

The July meeting with Roeder was the only one 
Metzger would acknowledge, but other Chronicle 
sources said that he met with Roeder in San Jose a 
month earlier. Metzger would not confirm or deny 
that meeting. 

Although Roeder's visit was monitored by state 
and national law enforcement agencies, none took 
action against him and all refused to comment on

I Racism-and prejudice 
naturally expressed 

Editor: . 
. It is refreshing to find 
someone capable of express-
ing . his racism, class 
prejudices and intellectual 
Pretensions in such a natural 
lucid manner. I will consider 
what Edgar Derby (The Daily 
GfUIt'dun., Oct 16) chauvinis-
tically calls our sepoy army-
that is, America's present 
volunteer army supplied by 
what can be called the 
"poverty draft" -in a column 
fOf' the bottom line in a future 
Daily GlI41'dia". In this letter 
I would like to expose a few of 
his intellectual pretensions. 

Edaar Derby fails to grasp 
the tllread of my argument 
because he is upset with the 
exaaerations an my article 
caused by brevity and my 
desire to spark controversy. 
Simply put, I contend that 
there has been a change in 
the mean!!J of the tenn 
"liberalism' in the last 
century-from a (X)Iloem for 
Re.publican liberties to an 
emphaaison Statism that has 

much in common with 
totalitarian philosophies. 
This is not to say that 
Kennedy was a totalitarian. 
Nor is it to say that Lincoln 
did not, in many ways, 
represent 3 transition from 
an older tradition of 
liberalism to a modern one 
caused by the consolidation 
of an industrial order in 
American society as a result 
of the Civil War. 

In his attempt to criticize 
the "whining" of the 
grandchildren of the 
pioneers, he fails to mention 
that his pioneers were 
escaping what they consider-
ed a too-settled, too-regulated 
Eastern society and that his 
pioneers obtained this 
abundant continent by 
stealing it from the native 
poRulation. Indeed, the 
services and benefits Edgar 
Derby claims this govern-
mf:llt provides us are the 
products of theft-of this

the American workers during

ism. In his attempt to 
demonstrate contradictions 
in my article, Edgar Derby 
points out the distinction I 
make between "government" 
and "country," yet fails to 
point out that I insist that 
such a distinction is not 
applicable in the case of the 
United States. 

As for "ownership," it is

Beware!!! 
Editor: 

To the Revelle Cafeteria 
management, the students 
and workers of UCSD, and 
the world: 

We, the militant students 
of UCSD, once again find it 
necessary to act. The same 
bad food, which last year 
drove us to plan and nearly 
execute one of the bloodiest 
cafeteria coups in the history 
of prepared food, is still being 
served each day in the Revelle 
Commons. 

This ongoing insult must 
be avenged. 

It is with this end in mind 
that we have dispatched out 
crack teams of culinary 
commandos to attempt to 
kidnap a food services 
manager. Out intention: to 
ransom him or her in 
exchange for better quality 
food.

STUDENTS OF UCSD 

But after readinB Tues· 
day's The Daily Guardian 
(Oct 21) I felt somwhat ill. 
Specifically, Robb Strom's 
letter was a classic piece of 
opinionated garbage. 

After forcing myself to 
finish his highly illegitimate 
and iIlconstructed opinion I 
could but come to one 
conclusion. It was an emotion 
filled personal attack on 
Marsha Vdovin. What Mr. 
Muir Council Chair has 
against Marsha this observer 
does not know, but one fact 
needs to be made clear. 
Marsha Vdovin is a valuable 
part of the AS Council. Her 
work on the AS and within 
other student organizations 
here on campus should be 
praised, and not attacked. I 
fear maybe Mr . Strom 
resents her reputation as a 
hard co-worker. 

The bill, for Mr. Strom's 
information, was not 
attacking Randy Woodard, 
the present AS advisor. It 
was in fact attacking the idea 
of the administration here on 
campus placing a represent-
ative to "watch over' the AS 
council. 

One last point for Mr. 
Strom. As a frequent 
observer at AS meetings this 
year, I must ask Mr. Strom 
where he gets his informa· 
tion as his face has not been 
seen much on Wednesday 
nights! \

I The Daily Guardian 3 

I ~ sfill wouldn't vote for. that bewildered pansy ... 
Editor.: 

Reluctant as I am to 
subject myself once again to 
the unsubstantiated ideology 
of Peter Laura, I feel 
nonetheless that lowe it to 
the impress ionable Daily 
Guardian readers to take 
issue with Pete's demago· 
guery. 

Since Pete has failed , even 
with his apparently sub· 
s tantial background in 
liberal arts - and I use the 
term conventionally - to see 
the objective of my first letter 
(The Daily Guardian , Oct. 15, 
1980), I am obliged to state 
that objective outright. 

My purpose was not, as his 
Oct. 20 letter implied, to 
prai se Governor Reagan. 
Rather, I took criticisms of 
Reagan from Peter's initial 
letter and directed them 
instead at Carter, with facts 
backing my argument. In 
doing this I had hoped to 
illustrate that voters' fears of 
Reagan, seemingly largely 
due to ficticious campaign 
rhetoric, are, after exami-
nation of President Carter's 
record in office, fears which 
voters should instead have of 
Carter. A corollary of this 
illustration was emphasizing 
the usefulness of factual 
evidence in backing one 's 
views and, in the process, 
making those views credible. 

Looking at the second 
sentence of Peter's latest 
letter, in which he nicknames 
the former governor " a 
bloodbath Reagan," I can't 
help but feel that my message 
did not get through. 

'I 

His second letter was, 
however. a slight improve-
ment over his fir st. I 
wholeheartedly agree that 
the .::itizens of this country 
are to blame for America 's 
decline. But Pete's tendencies 
to twist s tatements around 
and take them out of context 
have gotten the best of him . 
My question, "Who or what 
caused America to begin 
deteriorating?" was asked in 
response to his drawing some 
kind of relations hip between 
Reagan and the present state 
of our nation. If there is a 
govemmental body at fault . 
we can look to the party in 
control of Congress for the 
last 20 years, or if we wish , 
we can look all the way back 
to the New Deal for the 
answer. 

Now Peter, don' t jump to 
your trpewriter and accuse 
me 0 impracticality or 
insensitivity or any other 
wrongdoing. I didn 't say that 
the New Deal wrong. On the 
contrary, with my limited 
knowledge of American 
history, I can't think of a 
feasible alternat ive to it. But I 
am sure that you wou Id agree 
that Carter's forming the 
Department of Education 
was not a step in the right 
direction. 

I confess to carelessness in 
tating that Carter insti -

gated the "draft" when I 
mean t t o s ay " draft 
regi stration ." Well, I'm 
human just like _ everyone 
else. However, Peter is guilty 
of carelessness as well. He

NEWS BRIEFS 

Death penalty may 
be back in Calif 

SAN FRANCISCO -
Over caustic protests from 
the chief justICe, the state 
Supreme Court yesterday 
upheld a death penalty 
conviction and may possibly 
have signaled the resumption 
of executions in California. 

In a 4-3 decision by Justice 
Fnnk Richardson, the high 
oourt refused to throw out 
the conviction of Earl Uoyd 
Jackson, 22, convicted in the 
1979 slayinp of two elderly 
Long Beach women. The 
court also reaffirmed the 
"presumed" constitutional· 
ity of California's 1977 death 
penalty law, saying that it 
does not appear to "clearly, 
positively and unmistakab-
ly" violate the Eighth and 
Fourteenth amendments. 

Jackson's attorneys said 
they would file a petition for a 
rehearing within 15 days, 
and if that is denied, they will 
to go the US Supreme Court. 
Assistant defense attorney 
Joseph Walsh said a stay of 
execution would be sought 
immediately. 

Assistant Attorney 
General Howard Schwab 
called the decision "very, 

very important," saying it 
was the first time the 
California Supreme Court 
had upheld the death penalty. 
"I hope that today's decision 
will actually save Iives .... that 
people using a gun to commit 
felonies will be deterred," 
Schwab said. 

The last execution in the 
state took place in 1967, when 
Aaron Mitchell went to San 
Quentin's gas chamber for 
slaying a Sacramento 
policeman. 

Jackson was charged with 
the fatal beating of Vernita 
Curtis, a widow in herSOs, on 
Aug. 29, 1979, and the 
beating, strangulation and 
sexual assault of Gladys Ott, 
90, a week later. Under the 
state's death penalty law, the 
crimes were considered 
punishable by death because 
of two specific circumstances 
- murder in the course of a 
robbery and multiple 
killings. 

Jackson made various 
claims concerning the 
competency of his attorneys 
and the impartiality of the 
jury, but the high court 
rejected them.

Pres., Reagan 
on war, peace 

WASHINGTON - The 
issue is war and peace, and 
Jimmy Carter and Ronald 
Reagan have used it to 
portray themselves and their 
foreign policy positions in 
starkly contrasting terms. 

Car'ter often pictures 
Reagan as a irresponsible, 
shoot-from·the·hip purveyor 
of hard-line aggressiveness 
whose preference for military 
options in dangerous 
situations could lead the 
nation into a dangerous and 
costly arms race or thrust it 
into war. 

Reagan says Carter is 
vacillating, incompetent, 
weak, indecisive, and naive, 
that he spurn s America's ' 
"friends" in the world, 
confuses its allies and 
underestimates the Russi· 
ans 

And he says those qualities 
raise the possibility that 
under Carter, the nation 
could drift into war. 

Carter's defenders dismiss 
Rea~an's accusations at 
"ludIcrous," and cite the 
president's peacemaking 

efforts in the Middle East and 
Africa and his own self· 
proclaimed "passion for 
peace." 

On the Iranian hostage 
crisis, which will be a year 
old on Election Day, Reagan 
says Carter's foreign policy 
"helped create the entire 
situation that made their 
kidnap possible." 

Two more of 
the hostages 

LOS ANGELES - At 
least one more American, a 
California computer expert, 
has been taken hostage in 
Iran and may be in danger of 
execution because of his 
religious beliefs and his US 
citizenship, his family said 
yesterday. 

Iranian·born Mohi Sobh-
ani, a naturalized American 
citizen, was held in addition 
to 52 diplomatic hostages and 
a free· lance writer, said 
George Havens, a spokesman 
for the State Department's 
Iran Working Group in 
Washington, D.C. Sobhani, 
44, was arrested in Iran last 
month and is being held on 
unspecified charges. 

Sobhani's brother, Morris, 
a civil engineer in Santa

Barbara, said he believes he 
"was picked up because he is 
an American and because he 
is a member of the Baha'i 
faith." 

Morris Sobhani said his 
brother was seized Sept. 6 as 
he tried to leave Tehran with 
his wife and daughter. 

Actors OK 3 
year contract 

HOLLYWOOD - The 
Screen Actors Guild has 
ratified a new three·year 
contract with the film-TV 
producers by an overwhel-
ming margin, bringing an 
end to the longest strike in 
the union's history. 

The vote was 18,577 in 
favor, with 3,697 against and 
407 invalid according to 
Screen Actors Guild 
spokeswoman Kim Fellner, 
who said Thursday that the 
vote by nearly half the 
union's 45,000 members was 
the largest-ever SAG vote. 

"I was confident that the 
referendum would pass," 
said Chester Migden, SAG

"but I am astounded by the 
size of the vote and pleased 
with the percentage in 
favor."

Kahn's the brain 
behind La Jolla fest 
Annual San Diego Film Festival 
will be showing One Trick Pony 

BY LYNETTE TOM 
Stal! Writer 

La Jolla will be the site of an 
invasion for the next ten days. 
T here's no cause for concern, 
however; the invaders are peaceful. 
They're only guests attending the 3rd 
Annual San Diego International Film 
Festival . 

"The festival originated from an 
idea that I had," sa id its director, 
Greg Kahn. "I like films very much 
and I thought that San Diego would 
be good virgin territory, because 
nobody had done things like it before. 
So, I contacted some close friends , 
who agreed with me. They gave me 
the confidence and support I needed 
to do it." 

Such enthusiasm has extended to 
the community as well, starting with 
the La Jolla Museum of Contempor-
ary Art , where the festival has hung 
its banner for the past two years. 

"The museum has the nicest movie 
theater," Kahn says. "It seats 500, 
but more importantly, it's great being 
aligned with a museum of 
contemporary art, because it puts 
films in an appropriate setting. The 
staff has been a real great help." 

An average attendance of over 300 
is another indication of the festival 's 
popularity. During its first year of 
operation, 6,500 people passed 
through its doors. The fIgure rose to 
8000 for the followin~ year, and if 
calculations from maIl-order ticket 
sales and expected box office 
business are correct, the total may 

to 

"The people love the La Jolla area ," 
said Kahn. "Many of them who come 
to the festival are here in San Diego 
for the fir t time, which makes it 
great all the way around." 

The main reason for the festival's 
continued success lies in the choice of 
films shown, thanks to a selection 
committee, which, according to the 
festival director, "does anything in 
its power to see films by going to 
other festivals or seeing private 
screenings given by the filmmaker, 
compile a list, and argue over it for a 
few months until a decision is made." 

Because the pictures are, in Kahn's 
words, "intristically looked at," they 
needn't ascribe to a particular set of 
criteron in order to be chosen. 

"We don' t try to cater or tap a 
certain audience, " he stated, giving 
local filmmakers as an example. 
"Presently, we are not showing their 
work. That doesn't mean we're 
adverse to them. But, they are so few 
who are based in San Diego and make 
films that are commercially 
acceptable. " 

One of those handful of individuals 
is Jean-Pierre Gorin, a Visual Arts 
lecturer at UCSD. His documentary, 
Polo And Cabengo, was screened at 
last year's festival. 

"The reason why we showed Jean· 
Pierre 's film was not because he's in 
the San Diego area, but because he 
made an excellent film," added Kahn. 

Once the selection committee has 
12 

Video artists to 
show their work 

An exhibit of work by some of the 
West Coast's finest young video 
artists will be shown at the 
Mandeville Art Gallery next Monday 
and Tuesday from 3 to 6 pm. 

The exhibit, "California Video," 
was curated by Kathy Huffman for 
the Paris Biennale. Artweek critic 
Ruth E. Iskin said the show has "a 
freshness, an unpredictability and 
plenty of young blood." Several 
artists whose work will be shown are 
UCSD Visual Arts grad students, 
including Jan Peacock, Helen de 
Michiel and Dan Boord. 

The pieces in the exhibit are very , 
different from the video art of the 
1960s, which was largely created in a 
spirit of protest against the 

commercial medium of televis ion. As 
the art form has' matured, artists 
have become comfortable with it as 
an alternative to commercial 
television and have begun to 
popularize it . 

" Many of the tapes in the show 
have the quality of bizarre documents 
of our culture, probing our 
underlying attitudes to people, 
government, animals, consumeri m, 
television, modem romance, modern 
communication and the environ· 
ment," wrote Iskin in her review. 

"Like good storytelling, they havea 
message, but theIr didacticism tends 
to be entertaining rather than 
cumbersome."

'Our Gang' reunite 
in Los An~eles 

BY RICK GREENE St.« W riler 
When the death of William 

Thomas (Buckwheat) of the popular 
Our Gang comedies was reported in 
the front sections of newspapers 
across the country last week, it took 
many people by surprise. 

Not surpri e at his death, but 
surprise that he was still alive until 
then. ' 

Where was he? they asked. 
Every time a former little rascal 

passes away, the public reponds 
with another flurry of questions. 
What ever happened to the members 
of Our Gang? There are many 
conflicting reports , fal se rumours 
and Gang impostors, but you can 
count on the following information 
to be accurate. 

At a reunion of many of the Our 
Gang 'kids' at a Los Angeles film 
convention last summer, I met and 
spoke with each of them. 

The Our Gang series of film 
shorts was the brainchild (pardon 
the pun) of comedy producer Hal 
Roach in 1922. Roach also produced 
Harold Lloyd, and later the Laurel 
and Hardy films. 

The Gang wa featured in 169 
films at the Roach studios, and then 
anot her 52 for MGM. The last short 
of the series, Tale Of A Dog, was 
released in 1944. Some of the stars 
developed in the Gang included 
Spanky McFarland, Jackie Cooper, 
Dickie Moore and Darla Hood. 

All of these popular child stars 
seemed to instantly fade from pu blic 
view (with the exception of Jackie 
Cooper, who went on to direct 
Emmy·winning M*A *S*H episodes 
and was recently featured as Editor 
Perry White in Superman, The 
Movie.) UnforJunately, many of the 
Our Gang kids met with tragic ends. 

Off·key crooner Alfalfa Switzer, 
was shot in a bar in 1959 over a $50 
debt. Overweight "Chubby Chaney, 
featured in 18 sound comedies, died 
when he was just 18 years old, the 
victim of a glandular condition . 
"Froggy" Laughlin succumbed to a 
motor scooter accident . And 
Matthew Beard (Stymie) was for 
twenty·five years a heroin addict . 
(Beard has recovered, and can be 
seen as an extra in many Sanford 
And Son episodes). 

Buckwheat isn t the only Rascal 
to recently pass on. Darla Hood, the 

sweetheart of the Gang, died in 1979 
after a lifetime of showbusiness. 
After the Gang, she sang in a 
nightclu b act and later did the voice 
of the mermaid on "Chicken Of The 
Sea" commercials. Attending her 
funeral were Stymie, Buckwheat 's 
son and Mrs. Hal Roach. 

"Farina" Hoskins, who appeared 
m a whopping 105 comedies, was 
buried during the Our Gang 
reunion. 

Hal Roach, 88 years old, kicked off 
the reunion with his impression of a 
conversation between Stan Laurel 
and Oliver Hardy today. Then the 
Gang members, one by one, marched 
up to the podium to receive awards 
and reminice about the 'good old 
days.' 

Buckwheat was there. So was 
George "Spanky" McFarland , 
"Butch" Bond (tough-guy of the 
series) and his cellu liod sidekick 
"The Woim" Kibrick , Dorothy 
DeSorba, Sunshine Sammy (who 
appeared in the very first Gang 
comed y called , appropriatel y 
enough, Our Gang).Joe Cobb,Jackie 
Davis, Leonard Landy and a half 
dozen others. 

The reunion was dedicated to the 
memory of Darla Hood, who thought 
up the whole thing before she died. 
Rosina Lawrence, who playedoneof 
the schoolteachers, spoke a tribute 
to Darla. 

Today Spanky is a salesman , 
Dorothy a clerk, Butch a behind·the· 
scenes television worker and Jackie 
Davis as M.D. Some of the Gang 
members are trying to forget their 
wild pasts. 

"Porky" Lee lives in Texas as a 
schoolteacher, speaking to no one 
but Spanky. Mary AnnJackson lives 
in Shaker Heights, Ohio, refusing to 
speak to reporters and fans alike. 
Nobody is. sure what really 
happened to Wheezer, but he is 
belived to have been killed in a 
training camp during WW II. 

But even though many of these 
later· life stories are sad ones, the 
Gang lives on in thousands of cities 
across the world every day in 
television re-runs of the shorts. 
They'll continue to win over new 
generations of fans with timeless 
comedy , bouncy music and 
remarkable performances by 
remarkable children.

"That's our generation.

weapon. But there's a city

popular use is at festivals for 
dancing accompanied br,

and assorted other instru-
ments of Asian percussion 
(sasara. uchiwa). 

The guitarist . Peter Hata, 
originally played bass for the 
group. Leaving the group to 
study guitar and composi-
tion, he rejoined two years 
later to emerge as a principal 
writer. 

Once the band had formed 
in 1974, they began gigging in 
the Los Angeles area and 
around the s tate. gaining a 
reputation as one of the 
hottest unsigned bands in 
California. 

Tapes of their music got 
airplay o n station s in 
Berkeley and San Francisco.

Day Care 
letter 

continued from page 2 
facu lty, staff, academia , and 
students as we\l as the 
general public. 

The nursery school now 
offers three progr ams : 
M.W.F 9-12. 4 yr old Coop; 
T , TH 9-12 3 yr old Coop; and 
M,W,F 12-43 and 4 year old 
non-Coop. The number there 
is 455-9310. 

The UCSD Day Care 
Center. now on a firmer 
gro~~d with the University. 
anticIpates expansion in the 
near future. The Music 
Department is sponsoring a 
benefit concert scheduled for 
Sunday October 26 at 7:30 pm 
at . Mandeville Aud . to help 
raise funds for the mainten-
ance of the UCSD Day Care 
ce nter facilities . The 
c han ce llor and Mr s. 
Atkinson will be in 

. attendance at bot h the 
concert and the reception 
that follows , affording the 
university community the 
opportunity to chat with 
them in a more casual 
atmosphere. 

The UCSD Day Care 
Center and the International 
Center Nursery School are 
both cooperatively run. 
requiring only a minimal 
amount of participation on 
the part of the parent(s). The 
availability of on-campus 
quality childcare has been a 
constant struggle since day 

on~ (1968) when the only 
chlldcare available was 
parents co-oping on Revelle 
Plaza. 

The fact that the 
International Center's 
afternoon program may close 
due to a lack in enro\lment is 
a statement on the lack of 
quality coverage and 
communication between 
faculty, staff and students on 
this campus.

tion of the program, but urge 
San Diegans to take 
advantage of the televised 
debate to hear what the 
Presidentil candidates have

The UCSD Extension 
program was to be offered 
free and included comment-
ary on the Presidential 
candidates' campaign 
statements by a UCSD

receIves 
two awards 

Dr. Claude E. ZoBell, 
professor emeritus of marine 
microbiology at UCSD's 
Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography , recently 
received honors from two 
universities he graduated 
from in the 1920s. 

ZoBeIl, 76, was awarded an 
honorary degree of doctor of 
science from Utah State 
University during gradua· 
tion ceremonies held at 
Logan, Utah, May 31. He 
received his bachelor of 
science and master of science 
degrees in bacteriology from 
Utah State University in 
1927 and 1929, respectively. 

Idaho State University 
selected ZoBeIl as the 1980 
Most Distinguished Alum-
nus for his outstanding 
accomplishments during his 
career in science and 
education. He was a 1924 
graduate of the Southern 
Idaho College of Education in 
Albion. now a part of Idaho 
State University. 

ZoBell joined the Scripps 
faculty in 1932 after 
completing his doctoral 
studies at UC Berkeley. His 
nearly five decades of 
pioneering work and 
leadership in the fields of 
marine microbiology , 
petroleum microbiology, and 
barobiology (pressure 
biology) have brought him 
numerous awards and 
international recognition . he 
has been described as the 
"father" of marine microbio-
logy.

Alien's 
problent 

A newly- arrived Indo-
chinese immigrant may 
think his doctor impolite for 
asking him personal 
questions about his medical 
hi tory, for telling him to 
disrobe, or even for looking 
him in the eye during an 
examination. 

The newcomer might not 
know how to make an 
appointment, how to take a 
bus to a clinic, or where to go 
in case of an emergency. And 
then there's the language 
problem. 

To keep the cultural gap 
between east and west from 
creating a gap in good health 
care as well, a new program 
has been established at the 
downtown UCSD Medical 
Center. Financed . by a 
$247,000 grant from t he State 
Department of Social 
Services, the program will 
train four bicultural health 
workers and a Vietnamese 
physician, An Cao, MD, to 
help acquaint Indochinese 
immigrants in San Dieo with 
Western medicine and health 
practices. 

The new staff members 
also will help the UCSD 
medical staff better under-
stand the health practices 
and beliefs of their 
Indochinese patients. 

The Center for Indochinese 
Health Education also will 
offer Indochinese immi-
grants more comprehensive 
infectious disease screening 
than has been available to 
them before in San Diego. 

"It's not really their 
medical problems that make 
the Indochinese different 
from our other patients," 
says Antonio Catanzaro, MD, 
director of the Center for 
Indochinese Health Educa-
tion. "Our doctors and 
nurses can handle their 
medical problems already. 
It's the difficulty in 
communication and our 
different views of health and 
sickness that make a special 
program for the Indochinese 
necessary." 

Since the difficulties in 
communication are as much 
due to cultural differences as 
to language differences, the 
Medical Center needed more 
than interpreters. Hence, the 
state program to add the 
bicultural health workers to 
the downtown Medical 
Center's health team. 

Like interpreters, the 
center's four new bicultural 
health workers will be fluent 
both in English and one or 
more Indochinese languages 
- Vietnamese, Laotian, 
Hmong and Cambodian. 

Day Care

raise funds so that the Day 
Care Center can continue to 
offer its low-cost services to 
students. 

Currently there are over a 
hundred children of students 
on the Day Care waiting list. 

Care for children of 
students, faculty and staff is 
available at the International 
Center Co-op Nursery. 
Services at the nursery are 
endorsed by the Day Care 
Center.

La Jolla 
festival 

continued from page 5 
agreed upon the list, the next 
step is to secure the films, 
which Kahn regards as "the 
biggest problem." 

"There's a difficulty in the 
- availability of foreign films 

with English subtitles," he 
explained. "For US picture 
distribution, there is usually 
only one print. So, it's a 
matter of tracking it down 
and getting it through US 
customs. Sometimes, it takes 
us three years to get one 
film." 

The last statement refers 
to Boquitos Pintadas, an 
Argentinian picture who e 
filmmaker is dead and 
English su btitled version 
missing. 

"Also, we have to negotiate 
with the US distributors for 
foreign films who are afraid 
that bad reviews might hurt 
their commercial runs," 
Kahn added. 

Equally as frustrating is 
the acquisition of American 
films. 

"Most films, ther are 
distributed by arge 
companies who don't seem to 
care what they are doing," 
continued Kahn. "It takes a 
lot of phone calls, meetings 
and other things that we 
don't like, but have to do. We 
got One Trick Pony directly 
from Warner Brothers, so 
we've been pretty lucky." 

In addition to the 
screenings, the festival 
invites the filmmaker or star 
for a Question and answer 
session. Previous guests have 
included actors Burt 
Lancaster and Anthony 
Perkins and directors Jean-
Pierre Gorin and Joan 
Micklin Silver. 
The San Diego International 
Film Festival is a non-profit 
organizations that works the 
whole year around. All 
money made from ticket sales 
goes towards expenditures 
for the next festival, such as 
supplemental travel expens-
es for guest actors or 
filmmakers and ticket 
admissions. 

Pansy 
continued from page 3 
the jealous anti-Trilatera-
lists and others confirmed 
my belief that he was the 
most qualified and intelligent 
candidate, and therefore the 
unlikely candidate to win. 
When he withdrew from the 
race, I moved my support to 
Reagan. 

All this rhetoric aside, I 
would just like to say that 
this business of writing 
letters is good fun, and often 
more stimulating than 
schoolwork, and I thank 
Peter Laura, who I'm sure 
feels the same way, for giving 
me this opportunity. In the 
future I hope other fools like 
Peter and I take part in this 
activity.
