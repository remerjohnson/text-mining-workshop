New Festival Safety Measures 
Lead to Sun God Funding Gap 

PHOTO BY ALWIN SZETO/UCSD GUARDIAN

In response to an increase in hospitalizations during last year’s Sun God festival, expensive new health and safety initiatives will be in 
place at this year’s Sun God festival that are leading 
to a loss of revenue from years past. After prohibit-
ing the sale of tickets to off-campus guests as a part 
of these safety initiatives, Interim Vice Chancellor 
Student Affairs Alan Houston pledged $165,000 
to cover losses stemming from ASCE’s inability to 
raise funds from guest tickets. 

Because A.S. Concerts and Events is still unsure 
which safety measures will be in place, there is cur-
rently no concrete figure for this deficit. However, 
ASCE leadership is not worried about the quality 
of the event decreasing and plans on securing other 
revenue streams, primarily through sponsors as 
well as through Houston’s allocation.

AVP Concerts and Events Sarah Harley notes 
that this is a one-time payment and that ASCE will 

have to look at more sustainable sources of funding 
for future years. A survey conducted Fall Quarter 
2013 showed that students were willing to pay a 
small entrance fee in order to ensure the continu-
ance of the festival.

“We would never jeopardize health and safety 
because it’s expensive,” Harley said. “Sun God this 
year was very close to not happening, and the 
only reason it is happening this year is because 
we’re implementing all these new health and safety 
changes in hope that the Sun God culture changes 
and that we see a decrease in hospitalizations.”

A change announced during Fall Quarter 2013 
is that off-campus guests will no longer be able to 
attend Sun God. This rule was enacted because a 
significant share of the hospitalizations at from last 
year’s Sun God festival was non-students. Harley 
speculates that this may be because students are 
more affected by and thus more cognizant of 

Student Fee 
Referendum 
Saves Davis 
Newspaper
UC Davis students pledged 
$300,000 to save the Aggie 
from bankruptcy.

UC   SYSTEM

SUN  GOD  FESTIVAL

UC Davis students passed a refer-
endum to direct $300,000 in annual 
new student fee revenues to keep the 
Aggie, the university’s student news-
paper, from going bankrupt.

The Aggie, nearing its 100th year in 
publication, has relied solely on adver-
tisements for its funding. Like the 
Guardian, the Aggie is independent 
from Associated Students and receives 
no money from the school administra-
tion. However, due to increased pro-
duction costs and the general decline 
of ad revenue, the Aggie’s management 
over-projected the paper’s financial 
intake and relied on reserve funds to 
continue operating. In 2005, the paper 
had over $500,000 in reserves avail-
able, but by June 2014, that number 
will drop to just $1,000. As a result, the 
paper was forced to cut back on both 
its staff and publications — from daily 
to only once a week — this year.

After considering a variety of 
options, the Aggie staff ultimately sub-
mitted a Senate referendum for stu-
dent vote, titled Measure 1. Elizabeth 
Orpina, editor-in-chief of the Aggie, 
said that this bill would add an addi-
tional $3.88 to each student’s fees every 
quarter, with $3.10 going directly to 
the Aggie. The remainder would be 
put toward financial aid to assist those 
that cannot afford UC Davis’s student 
fees, which are the highest of all the 
UC campuses. 

“The money will be delved up into 
adding one more day of print to keep 
us a little more relevant, and we’re 
also going to hire two more profes-
sional staff members,” Orpina told the 
Guardian. “Part of the fee also goes to 
offset the loss of advertising that we 
had and we also want to bring back 
2008–09 pay levels. We have really 
good talent, but right now they’re 
working for free and we have a really 
large turnover.”

According to the ASUCD elections 
webpage, 27 percent of UC Davis’s 
26,000 undergraduates participated 
in the ballot, with nearly 73 percent 
voting in favor of the new fee. This 
fulfilled the supermajority required 
to pass Measure 1, though a mis-
communication led to an unusually 
large number of abstentions. The ref-
erendum will now go to UC Davis 
Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi and UC 
President Janet Napolitano for final 
approval.

The Aggie reached out through 
social media and local news outlets 
to raise support for Measure 1 in the 
weeks leading up to the vote. UC Davis 
alumni and several ASUCD electoral 
candidates also gave their endorse-
ments for saving the Aggie. 

UC Davis Senator Miles Thomas 
believed that the fee was a relatively 
small price to pay. “You can’t have a

AFSCME 3299 Will Strike Next Week
Union members approved a third walkout in 12 months by a 92-percent margin.

The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
Local 3299 has announced a five-day 
strike next week, the union’s third 
in the last 12 months. Service work-
ers, including grounds-keeping and 
food service workers, represented by 
AFSCME 3299 will officially strike, 
while patient care technical workers 
are set to hold a sympathy strike.

An estimated 96 percent of union 
members from both divisions voted 
in support of the strike two weeks 
ago.  

The union and the UC system 
have been negotiating a renewal of 
the workers’ expired contracts since 
September 2012, though stalled bar-

gaining led to two, two-day strikes 
in May and October of last year. 
Next week will be the union’s longest 
strike.

UC service worker Jose Mendez, 
who has served on AFSCME 3299’s 
bargaining team, believes that the 
system’s lowest-paid workers are 
denied benefits offered to other 
unions.

“After more than a year of good 
faith bargaining, this is not where 
we’d hoped to be,” Mendez said. 
“Unfortunately, UC’s refusal to sup-
port reasonable proposals that pro-
tect those who do the most physi-
cally demanding labor at UC from 
injury on the job and poverty at 
home has left us with no choice.

AFSCME 3299’s ongoing griev-
ances revolve around the low wages 
and pensions paid to service workers. 

The union has also brought up alle-
gations that the UC system’s practice 
of hiring lower-paid, inexperienced 
workers contributes to a growing 
number of workplace injuries.

The UC system released a state-
ment regarding AFSCME 3299’s 
strike through Vice President of UC 
Human Resources Dwaine Duckett.

“We are deeply disappointed that, 
even as contract negotiations con-
tinue, AFSCME leadership has cho-
sen to take this path, which hurts 
our students, patients and the UC 
community,” Duckett said. “At a cost 
to [University of California] of about 
$10 million a day to ensure that criti-
cal services for students and patients 
continue safely, these strikes waste 
precious university resources and

SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY

A Scripps Institute of  Oceanography 
study on Arctic ice melting was the 
first to use direct satellite measure-
ments to assess the changes in the 
amount of sunlight that is reflected 
back into space from Earth, called the 
Earth’s albedo. The study used satel-
lites from NASA’S Clouds and Earth’s 
Radiant Energy System to measure the 
decrease in albedo in the Arctic due to 
the melting of the surface layer of ice 
that covers the Arctic Ocean.

Darker colors absorb the most 
sunlight, and as the white layer of 
the Arctic surface ice sheet melts, the 
reflective sheet is replaced by a darker 
ocean surface. This causes the earth 
to absorb a greater amount of solar 
energy and, in turn, increases global 
warming because of the added green-
house gases. 

Arctic sea ice has decreased by 40 
percent since the 1970s, along with 
the amount of albedo falling from 52 
percent to 48 percent between 1979 
and 2011. This is due to the warming 
of the Arctic by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 
degrees Fahrenheit) during that same 
time period.  

This melting behavior was origi-
nally predicted 45 years prior to 
this study by atmospheric scientists 
Mikhail Budyko and William Sellers. 
While previous studies relied on com-
puter models, the Scripps team were 
able to utilize CERES’s satellite instru-
ments along with observations of the 
sea ice cover made with other satellites 
to detect the Earth’s albedo and cor-
rectly measure the amount of Arctic 
sea ice that is melting. The team found 
that the magnitude of the surface dark-
ening is much greater than expected — 
about two to three times as large as the 
previous studies have shown. 

Geosciences professor Neal 
Driscoll says he is worried about 
decreased albedo.

“Scientists are very concerned with 
the darkening of the Arctic,” Driscoll 
said. “The albedo of sea water is much 
less than ice, consequently, the Arctic 
Ocean is absorbing more incoming 
insulation. This feedback is creating 
ice-free conditions in the summer with 
the complete loss of multi-year ice.” 

This is the first time in history 
that the darkening effect has been 
documented on the scale of the 
entire Arctic Ocean, illustrating that 
the amount of albedo diminishing 
because of the sea-ice retreat is quite 
large. Although it is not certain, this 
might contribute to rise in global 
warming that Earth experienced in 
the past several decades.

A decrease in the reflective layer means the Earth will absorb more solar energy.

the consequences of unsafe behavior, 
such as the cancellation of Sun God 
in future years.

Another policy that will be imple-
mented is that no guests will be allowed 
in The Village or International House. 
According to Harley, the number of 

incidences last year in The Village was 
almost as many as those that occurred 
on RIMAC field. 

“I’m confident that we’re doing all 
that we can to make this year’s Sun 
God safer,” Harley said. “We’re really 
working hard to get the word out 
about these changes and changing 

the culture of Sun God. I’m confident 
about the work that ASCE has done 
and all the people we’ve been work-
ing with to make this year’s Sun God 
a success.”

only serve to interfere with reach-
ing a fair contract and getting our 
employees the raises they deserve 
and have been waiting too long for.”

The UC system has already set-
tled negotiations with most of the 
other unions in its employ, including 
University Professional and Technical 
Employees- Communications 
Workers of America Local 9119.

Duckett further stated that the 
system has offered AFSCME several 
unique positions during the contract 
negotiations.

“We have offered AFSCME very 
good contract proposals: Patient 

care workers would receive a wage 
increase of 20 percent over four years 
and service workers 16 percent over 
the same period,” Duckett said. “In 
addition, the university has offered 
to freeze employee health care costs 
— a benefit not offered to any other 
union.”

A statement from AFSCME 
3299 representative Todd Stenhouse 
affirmed that a majority of UC ser-
vice workers live on wages that are 
too low.

“UC’s final contract offer still 
leaves 95 percent UC Service work-
ers income eligible for some form 
public assistance,” Stenhouse stated. 
“[It] does not address the workload 

issues that are contributing to rising 
injury rates and refuses to accept the 
same standards on contracting out 
that are required of CSU, California’s 
Community Colleges, or other State 
Agencies.”

UCSD students have previously 
joined AFSCME 3299 members in 
their strikes and demonstrations. 

Though the location for the 
strike, takes place March 3 to March 
–7, has not been confirmed, the 
union is likely to strike both on cam-
pus and at UCSD’s medical center in 
Hillcrest.

university without a campus newspa-
per,” Thomas said in a Feb. 21 Modesto 
Bee article. “They keep the administra-
tion of UC Davis accountable.” 

“I generally enjoy reading 
[the Aggie],” UC Davis freshman 
and Ethnic and Cultural Affairs 
Commissioner Andrew Loke said in 
an online statement. “I hope that this 
measure will give stability to the Aggie. 
However, it’s important to note that the 
Chancellor has the authority to amend 
the measure before it’s implemented so 
ASUCD should remain cautious.” 

Orpina said that the staff remained 
committed to a transparent campaign, 
in line with UC Davis regulations 
despite “the mess,” although the deci-
sion to run a pointedly blank front 
page in one issue raised controversy 
with the school. 

There was some vocal opposition 
to the measure. Alex Tavlian, a UC 
Davis senior, sent an opinion editorial 
to the paper, criticizing Measure 1 as a 
“blank check in perpetuity” with “very 
little information being provided to the 
voters as to what the Aggie plans to do 
to avoid another financial meltdown.” 

Other campus news leaders added 

that the money would be better spent 
on all student media, rather than a 
single organization reliant on printed 
news for profit. 

Orpina maintains that the added 
fee is small in comparison to the pay-
ments that students make to other 
campus services and athletics. She says 
that the Aggie has definite plans to 
manage its budget more effectively in 
the future and will work with oppo-
nents of Measure 1 to make sure their 
concerns are addressed.

I got my taste of fame at last 
night’s Council meeting from 
Chairman of College Republicans 
Austin Peters. He turned around 
to me, knew my name and thanked 
me for writing my column. I have 
a reader!

He came to announce that 
the College Republicans sup-
port Arizona 
Governor Jan 
Brewer’s veto 
of Arizona SB 
1062. He fur-
ther explained 
that he is the only white male to 
be a part of College Republicans’ 
executive board and 
that, “I do not want 
to privatize the uni-
versity, I am not an 
imperialist and I’d 
love to have open 
conversation about 
how to make this 
university a great 
place.”

Kyle Heiskala 
then presented on 
behalf of ASUCSD Moves and 
said that the transportation ref-
erendum language just needs 
to pass through the Chancellor 
and Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning.

Social Sciences Senator Colin 
King decided to put a project to 
create an infographic on how to 
add a major or minor on hold. 
Faculty support is required to start 
the process, and faculty knows the 
steps that would be included on 
the infographic and thus advised 
King to halt the project.

Another project he introduced 
was changes to Campus ID cards 
including a new background pic-
ture and emergency contact infor-
mation on the back.

VP Finance and Resources 
Sean O’Neal made a presenta-
tion in response to recent bills in 
various states that legalize various 
forms of discrimination if it is in 
accordance with religious beliefs. 
He recognized that proponents of 
these bills are constitutionally fair 
in their arguments but that oppo-

nents are equally 
correct in citing 
equal protection 
for all citizens.

Later in the 
evening, council 

passed a resolution condemn-
ing state governments legalizing 

discrimination spon-
sored by O’Neal.

Council also 
passed a referen-
dum to put A.S. 
Constitutional 
Amendments to a 
student vote. One of 
the main concerns 
addressed was that 
students are not aware 
enough of the issues 

to make an informed vote. O’Neal 
called upon senators, executives 
and the Guardian to educate con-
stituents and peers on the issues.

“We do a disservice to the 
student body when we assume 
they’re too stupid to decide for 
themselves,” Revelle Senator Soren 
Nelson agreed.

VP External Vanessa Garcia 
announced a new initiative to bet-
ter inform commuter students on 
student-friendly landlords and 
their rights as renters. Her advice 
for future initiatives is to create a 
Yelp-like page with local landlords 
in order to protect students. 

I’d like to give a shout out to my

one of you out there for sure!

Four years ago, the fragile tran-
quility of the La Jolla campus was 
shattered by a series of events now 
known at the “Compton Cookout.” 
Cutting-edge scholarship on cam-
pus climate emphasizes the need for 
universities to continually revisit 
their “historical legacy” as a bench-
mark for progress. Therefore, as 
much as administrators would like 
to erase the “Cookout” and its after-
math, it is crucial that we remember 
the events of February 2010.

We view calls to “move beyond” 

the past and erase any memory of 
the events that transpired as noth-
ing more than an attempt to release 
newly installed administrators from 
their responsibilities. It is time to 
hold accountable everyone involved 
in the “strategic planning” that will 
determine the future of UCSD and 
impact the lived experiences of future 
generations of students. Do any of 
the various strategic planning groups 
have any knowledge of what the uni-
versity agreed to do in the agreement 
signed by the previous chancellor in 

2010? Where in the “strategic plan” 
is there a place for the advancement 
of women and historically underrep-
resented students, staff and faculty? 
How do these groups fit into the 
research and fundraising agendas of 
the future?

We do not write this letter from 
a position of authority — our view 
is partial; we know other groups 
will come at these issues differently. 
Our analysis is informed by the 
contrast between the intensity of 
those two weeks in February 2010 

and the lack of substantial prog-
ress since then. Our objective is to 
reinvigorate the tension that is a 
necessary precondition for produc-
tive change. One of the outcomes 
of the so-called “Cookout/noose” 
episode is that administrators with 
an investment in the status quo 
have co-opted terms like “equity,” 
“inclusion” and even “social jus-
tice.” “Diversity” itself has become 
nothing more than an empty slogan 

Spiking Our Stats
The perennially bottom-dwelling and currently winless men’s volleyball 
team needs some major changes to become a serious NCAA contender.

0-15.
Let that sink in for a moment: zero 

and fifteen.
Triton men’s volleyball has struggled 

time and time again throughout its exis-
tence, but the current season has proved 
particularly troublesome for the team. 
The men’s volleyball team has never 
recorded a single season with a winning 
record (though the Tritons came close 
in 1989, finishing 17–18), and still this 
season looks to be one of the most disap-
pointing in UCSD history.

With last Friday’s shutout loss to Long 
Beach State, Triton men’s volleyball is 
now winless through 15 games this year. 
The team has only won three total sets 
this entire year, meaning that in most 
matches, UCSD isn’t even making its 
games remotely competitive. The UCSD 
Guardian staff has won the same number 
of intercollegiate volleyball games as our 
university’s squad this season, which is 
sad and unacceptable.

UCSD’s men’s volleyball struggles 
became more apparent after the school 
made the move from Division III to 
Division II in the 2000–01 season. At 

that time, three sports at UCSD, men’s 
volleyball, fencing and men’s water polo, 
were forced to begin competing against 
Division-I schools because no Division-
II conference existed. The lack of a 
Division-II conference puts those teams 
in a tight spot — right now, UCSD is 
one of only two Division-II schools in 
the NCAA men’s volleyball conference. 
UCSD’s Division-I competitors in the 
conference, the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, have proven themselves 
tough opponents — but this is no excuse 
for the program to continue its down-
ward spiral. If we want our men’s vol-
leyball team to succeed, we need to start 
making drastic changes to the team’s 
administration.

Volleyball Head Coach Kevin Ring has 
found it difficult for the team to achieve 
success. The athletic department’s website 
calls Ring’s 2009 squad “the most suc-
cessful season in program history.” To 
put that in perspective, in 2009, UCSD 
volleyball had a .364 winning percentage 
in conference play, finished the season 
13–15 and in ninth place in the MPSF 
— which seems more impressive than it

Last week, when a Facebook friend of mine shared her results for the “What’s Your 
Inner Potato?” BuzzFeed quiz, she 
unleashed a monster. Initially, this 
had me wondering why people 
actually enjoy taking these kinds of 
completely arbitrary and obscure 
quizzes, but also thinking about 
how many types of potatoes there 
really are out there. But when my 
curiosity got the best of me, it made 
me take the quiz.

I won’t judge you if you stop 
reading this column right now so 
you can hop on to your computer 
and take the potato quiz (I got 
French Fries, in case you were 
wondering) — but be aware, as I’m 
sure you are, that if you’re looking 
for some direction in life, BuzzFeed 
quizzes aren’t going to give you any. 
They’re ridiculously fun to take, 
but are about as helpful as getting 
relationship advice from Siri. None 
of us need to know what kind of 
font or sandwich we should be, and 
none of us plan to pack our bags 
and leave the country if a quiz tells 
us we should live in Antarctica, but 
we’re just as hooked to learning our 
results anyway.

There’s no denying that these 
quizzes are the perfect, amusing 
distractions and procrastination 
tools for any college student trying 
to avoid falling asleep in physics. I 
know that if I’ve been assigned to 
analyze the cinematography and 
mise-en-scene elements of a two-
hour-long, foreign film, I really 
shouldn’t be going on BuzzFeed to 
take personality quizzes. But one 
look at my Facebook News Feed 
and I force myself to justify finding 
out what kind of dog I am or what 
my favorite Pokémon character says 
about me. Even if I’m incredibly 
busy or have too much homework, 
I usually convince myself that if I 
don’t take the quiz, I’ll be left too 
curious to actually focus on the 
work I have to do.

But the worst part about these 
quizzes’ effect on me is that I can 
never just take one and move on 
with my life. Like many others, I 
have a love/hate relationship with 
analyzing the results. We either 
love them so much that we want 
to share them with everyone we 
know or hate them so much that 
we retake the quiz again and again 
to get the results that “make more 
sense.” It’s not like we expect 
these descriptions to confirm real 
truths about who we really are, 
but nobody wants to find out that 
they’re a bad BFF or the Ringo of 
their friend group. 

After repeatedly answering a 
bunch of completely random, “Pick 
your Channing Tatum”-type ques-
tions, I’m still sad about supposedly 
being a Great Dane instead of an 
adorable Corgi or lovable Doge. 
But these things are for sure: I’m 
never going to be an environmen-
tal science major (I barely passed 
ENVR30) destined to live in France 
and eat burritos for lunch every 
day, but my short attention span 
and easily amused personality will 
inevitably lead me to happily taking 
more BuzzFeed quizzes. Keep them 
coming, BuzzFeed, but for the next 
dog quiz, save me some time and 
just make me a Corgi.

Dear Editor,
I was sad to hear that the UCSD 

recreation department has decided 
to tear out the grass at Muir Field 
and replace it with synthetic turf at 
the end of this upcoming summer. 
As a UCSD alumnus, I remember 
fondly spending time out on Muir 
Field: throwing Frisbees with friends, 
regularly walking a friend’s dog, eating 
lunch and just kicking back. While 
an undergrad, I also spent time as 
a counselor for the Knock Around 
Club, Recreation’s own kids’ summer 
day camp, where Muir Field played 
host to our daily lunches and after-
noon games and activities.

To think of that wonderful, grassy 
field, which doubles as open park 
space, being replaced by tire crumb 
rubber and fake plastic blades is 
deeply upsetting and also makes me 
wonder what in the world the recre-
ation department is thinking. Fake 
turf gets boiling hot in the summer, 
has no self-cleaning properties as real 
earth and grass do, has infill that is 
made up of chopped up bits of toxic 
automobile tire (simulating real dirt) 
and contributes to global warming. I 
know that the university prides itself 
on being a “green” campus but allow-
ing toxic and off-gassing synthetic 
turf to replace a living, breathing, 
natural system is a joke. I encourage 
everyone who hasn’t spent time on 
Muir Field to go out and take a look 
and try and envision a field of plastic 
where there is now grass and worms 
and birds and dogs and dandelions 
and kids and students.

If Muir Field needs to be replaced 
with a better functioning field for 
athletic games, then put in some 
new grass and simply take care of it. 

That way, the athletes will be happy, 
the dogs will be happy, the birds and 
bees will be happy, the kids will be 
happy, I will be happy and the Earth 
will be happy.

For all who care about saving 
Muir Field, I suggest you contact the 
Director of Recreation Dave Koch 
(dkoch@ucsd.edu) or the Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Alan Houston (vcsa@ucsd.edu).

Dear Editor,
On behalf of the Well-being 

Cluster Student Advisory Board, we 
are writing in response to the opinion 
piece “What We’re Wishing for in 
2014.” WCSAB is a board comprised 
of student representatives that work 
with staff from the well-being cluster 
to help identify students’ well-being 
needs and promote campus well-
being. We hold open meetings start-
ing at 5 p.m. on Monday’s of weeks 2, 
4, 6 and 8 at Murray’s Place in Student 
Health Services. In this piece, there 
were several inaccurate statements 
that we would like to address.

1. Regarding the statement of “in 
2014, we don’t want to pay out of our 
own pockets for the administration’s 
costly mistakes…” in the “someone 
to save our SHIP,” it is correct and 
widely known that the plan incurred 
a $61 million deficit since it began 
operating, and it is true that a large 
portion of that debt was incurred by 
UCSD. However, it has always been 
the understanding that this is not the 
fault of the students. The premiums 
were set too low by our previous 

actuarial firm, Aon Hewitt, and as 
such, the UC Regents have sued 
Aon Hewitt for their negligence and 
mismanagement. The students will 
NOT pay this $61 million deficit, but 
UC Office of the President will pay; 
however, any deficit incurred going 
forward will be the students’ respon-
sibility. The good news is that we have 
a new firm who is committed to mak-
ing SHIP viable and sustainable and 
financial reports from this year show 
that the plan is in the black.

2. Regarding the statement of 
“campus should also do more to help 
students quit and be lenient with fines 
…” in the “support for students affect-
ed by the UC-wide smoking ban,” 
UCSD is currently in the educational 
stages of enforcement of the smoking 
policy and therefore has not imple-
mented any fines related to this policy. 
While fines may be implemented 
in the future, the administration of 
UCSD strongly believes in educating 
students. Lastly, our campus through 
Student Health Services does provide 
many resources in helping students 
quit, such as free nicotine replacement 
and cessation programs. Students can 
also call the free California smokers 
helpline (1-800-NO-BUTTS).

3. Regarding the statement of “we 
hope the newly created Task Force 
can increase its transparency and get 
students on board with its changes” 
in the “clear communication 
between students and the Sun God 
Task Force,” the Sun God Festival 
Task Force has made every effort to 
be transparent from the very begin-
ning by opening all of their meetings 
to the public and posting all of their 
minutes online at www.vcsa.ucsd.
edu/committees/sungod/index.html. 
They recently came to present to 
our board and were able to answer 
our questions and clear up some 
misconceptions. They are making 

presentations to various student 
organizations that would like more 
information about the new changes 
to this year’s festival. We encourage 
you to familiarize yourself with their 
website, as well as to invite them to 
your office.

Dear Editor,
Prior to last December, I had 

never been off-roading in a beat-
up, mud-streaked Land Rover. I’d 
never ridden a camel, nor had I 
hiked to the ruins of an ancient 
Roman stronghold. I had never 
spent the night in the desert; there 
is something awe-inspiring, hum-
bling, about the vastness of an open 
sky, the silence of a billion twin-
kling stars.

These were only a few memories 
from my Taglit: Birthright trip. 
What is Taglit? Though advertised 
simply as “a free trip to Israel,” it 
meant so much more than that 
to me. For one, it was a chance to 
experience another culture in an 
unprecedented way.

Yes, at times we were tourists. 
We floated gleefully in the Dead 
Sea, posed smiling for pictures and 
browsed the shops at Ben Yehuda 
Street in Jerusalem just like many 
other visitors do. For the most part, 
however, we stopped, observed, lis-
tened; we learned from our guides. 
They emphasized the importance 
of “witnessing” rather than merely 
“visiting.” At Rabin Square, we 
questioned a stranger about the 

day his prime minister was assas-
sinated, and I was reminded of my 
father telling me about the day John 
F. Kennedy was killed. We talked 
politics on a mountain overlooking 
Syria. We heard a Holocaust survi-
vor speak at the World Holocaust 
Center, Yad Vashem.

On our third day in Israel, we 
were joined by members of the 
IDF — the Israeli Defense Force 
— young adults who, like us, were 
travelling the country to connect 
with its history and people. We 
became fast friends, swapping sto-
ries and seeing the sights together. 
I keep in touch with them today. 
This is a big part of the personal tie 
that I feel to Israel now. In addition 
to learning about my heritage, I 
have met and am linked to people 
who are my counterparts and 
friends, across the world.

Birthright is a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity — and I say that seri-
ously, sincerely. It allowed me to see 
the beautiful land of Israel; I will 
never forget the colors of the sun-
rise over the Negev Desert, or the 
glittering, teal waters of the Sea of 
Galilee. I have a newfound appre-
ciation for my own family history. 
And I will never forget the people 
that I met on my journey, which 
includes both my Israeli friends 
and the others in my Birthright 
group. Though spread out across 
California and a few other states, 
the bonds we formed while over-
seas keep us close. For all of these 
reasons, I could not more strongly 
recommend this life-changing 
experience.

I traveled with UCSD Hillel.

 2 A common complaint about the Oscars is 

that a film with an emotional appeal to a wide-
ranging audience often wins out over a film of 
higher artistic merit. (Remember 2004’s win-
ner “Crash”?) And when the first trailers were 
released for “12 Years a Slave,” it appeared to be 
yet another Spielberg-like tearjerker, naturally 
built for an Oscar win.

But in the capable hands of British direc-
tor Steve McQueen (auteur of criminally 
underrated films “Shame” and “Hunger”), “12 
Years a Slave” is never maudlin or moralistic 
— instead, it is a harrowing personal journey 
through the abyss. The film follows the travails 
of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free 
black man imprisoned and sold as slave in 
Antebellum South.

McQueen’s lush and painterly cine-
matography provides a stark contrast 
to the horror on screen, letting the 

incredible performances (especially from new-
comer Lupita Nyong’o) treat America’s original 
sin with the grave and unrelenting gaze it 
needs. It does not falter even for a second in 
its relentless portrayal of one man’s hell, free of 
any easy answers or Oskar Schindlers to offer 
a glimmer of hope in the darkness.

For its masterful combination of 
artistic strength and historical actu-
ality, “12 Years A Slave” is the 
most deserving Best Picture 
nominee to appear in years.

Director Alfonso Cuaron redefined the possibilities 
of what Hollywood magic could achieve in the making 
of outer space drama “Gravity.” The film stars Sandra 
Bullock and George Clooney as two astronauts fighting to 
survive catastrophe while suspended in space, and Cuaron 
pioneered new techniques in cinematography that sur-
passed the achievement of previous science fiction films.

Current technology proved to be inadequate to gener-
ate the illusion of microgravity, so Cuaron had to develop 
new techniques — he designed special cages and strapped 
the actors inside. Bullock spent up to 10 hours a day 
inside the cage, so to relieve her from feeling claustropho-
bic and exhausted, Cuaron had the crew throw a party 

every day to celebrate her arrival on set.
Due to the large amount of robotics used in the film, 

Cuaron had to plan every shot ahead of time to correctly 
program the robots with. Eventually, the live-action shots 
and CGI effects were blended seamlessly to create the 
perfect replication of space. 

Cuaron uses long sweeping takes of the astronauts as 
they are thrown around, blurring the lines of reality and 
fiction for viewers. It is unquestionable that the innova-
tion conceived for “Gravity” created the most realistic 
astronomical film ever made — Cuaron has pushed the 
art of moviemaking past the boundaries, setting new ones 
for other directors.

It’s about damn time Leo wins an Academy Award.
His portrayal of the out-of-control Wall Street playboy Jordan Belfort in “The 

Wolf Of Wall Street,” which has earned him his fourth Best Actor nomination, is 
a solid, if not superb, addition to the long list of varied and well-executed roles 
he has taken on over the past two decades. As the drug-fueled Belfort, DiCaprio 
exposes the distorted perception of a man on a fanatical quest for wealth or, as he 
charmingly puts it, “boats and hoes.” 

There’s really no way to ignore the elephant in the room. (In this scenario, 
said room is the Dolby Theatre.) Ever since his first nomination in 1994 for the 

heartbreaking portrayal of young Arnie in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?” he 
has undeniably been snubbed. Does someone in the Academy hold a personal 
grudge against sweet Leo? It’s been 15 years since “Titanic,” so dismissing him 
as pretty-boy bait for blockbusters is not relevant. And what about his roles in 
“The Aviator,” “Blood Diamond” and “Django Unchained”? Why hasn’t he won 
an Oscar yet? We live in a world where Cuba Gooding, Jr. has won an Oscar for 
“Jerry Maguire,” but not Leo. There is no logical explanation.

Leo doesn’t need an Oscar to validate his career. But receiving one certainly 
wouldn’t hurt.

You know the song “Blue Moon,” don’t you? Cate Blanchett, as a washed-
up, emotionally unstable socialite, seems to think everybody does. In a film 
that bears a striking resemblance to Tennessee Williams’, “A Streetcar Named 
Desire,” Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” capably enters new territory. In this 
role, Blanchett channels her inner Blanche Dubois. Jasmine is a jetsetter who 
divorces a swindler, has a nervous breakdown and finds herself broke in San 
Francisco. With her lavish lifestyle gone, all that’s left is a needy hypochondri-
ac plagued by loneliness. When she’s not popping pills and slurping Martinis 
with a lemon twist, she’s feeling sorry for herself and getting lost in past recol-

lections. Blanchett makes it difficult for the audience with her often irritating 
performance, because we constantly fluctuate between contempt and empathy. 
Jasmine faults others or claims ignorance for the problems that are her doing. 
Then, she might drop a little white lie here or throw a tantrum there and 
whine, “Why me?” When it is all said and done, she is a pitiful mess with no 
money, no husband and no home, and despite her incessant babbling no one 
cares about “Blue Moon.” Honestly, she probably had it coming. In the tradi-
tion of Vivien Leigh’s tragic role in “Streetcar,” Cate Blanchett just might bring 
home a statuette for her own neurotic wreck of a character.

In “Dallas Buyers Club,” first-time Oscar nominee Jared Leto’s performance 
doesn’t even feel like acting — he completely transforms into Rayon, a transgen-
der woman diagnosed with HIV. Leto, known for his almost disturbingly inscru-
table roles in “Requiem for a Dream” and “Mr. Nobody,” is considered to be a 
method actor, devoting himself to his character both on and off screen — accord-
ing to Chris Johnson of the Daily Mail, Leto even starved himself on set. The pay-
off is extraordinary: Leto is almost unrecognizable in his role, both in his physical 
appearance and in his acting. Dramatically departing from his usual minimalistic, 

hypnagogic style, Leto’s portrayal is emotionally charged and shockingly realistic.
In the film, Rayon’s diagnosis leads her to form an unlikely partnership with 

Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a homophobic redneck who provides 
medical treatment to AIDS victims. Leto as Rayon moves from a queen of sass 
who you can’t help but root for to a broken daughter rejected by her own father. 
Leto’s acting embodies the struggle to live and to love, transforming “Dallas 
Buyers Club” from an ordinary medical drama to a tale of palpable hope and 
compassion.

With visceral scenes of savage cruelty, raw 
anguish and mounting hopelessness, a film like 
“12 Years a Slave” makes picking out any one actor 
or actress as the strongest performance a contest 
of inches. To that end, the riveting despair Lupita 
Nyong’o embodies as Patsey, the favorite female 
slave of the egomaniacal Edwin Epps (Michael 
Fassbender), is a singular dramatic achievement. 
Throughout the film, Patsey is forced to endure 
the singular perversions and cruelties of her 
would-be master’s attention.

The role is one that could easily be overplayed 
or marginalized by the protagonist’s struggles, 
but naked desperation brings this supporting 

character to the forefront of the action. This 
manifests itself in some of the film’s most gripping 
scenes, such as the ferocious beating of one slave 
by another or the spurn of a slaveholder’s wife. 
While the educated Solomon Northup (Best Actor 
contender Chiwetel Ejiofor) stands apart from his 
fellow slaves, Nyong’o endows Patsey with all the 
suffering of the thousands who did not escape 
slavery. Watching Patsey endure forced labor and 
rape all seems too harsh to be real. But when she 
begs for Solomon to end her life, there’s a frailty 
and heartbreaking honesty in the delivery that 
perfectly portrays a woman pulling at every last 
ounce of strength she can muster.

GUARDIAN’S CHOICE AWARDS
WE HONOR THE FILMS THAT HOLLYWOOD WAS TOO AFRAID TO.

BEST PICTURE: 
“12 Years a Slave”

“Pacific Rim” is basically the coolest “Power Rangers” epi-
sode of all time. Featuring epic oceanic battle sequences and a 
multi-racial cast, “Pacific Rim” transcends the conventions of 
the robot-monster genre.

The plot sounds ridiculous at first: Humanity has engi-
neered gigantic, human-like machines to combat monsters 
called “Kaijus” that have emerged from an interdimensional 
portal on the Pacific Ocean floor. However, these machines, 

called Jaegers, can only be operated by two human minds, 
joined through a neural bridge.

While the film is not an Oscar contender, it deserves nomi-
nations for “Best Special Effects” and “Best Directing.” Director 
Guillermo Del Toro pays spectacular homage to the Kaiju 
genre, slowing down the large-scale fights for optimal visuals 
and using stop motion to engage all of the audience’s senses — 
a tactic few action flicks employ. By building the battle scenes 
frame by frame, the intricate details of the designs are more 

prominent — from a Jaeger’s four-story-tall head to the 
supersaturated color palette of Hong Kong and Japan. 

Robot-monster carnage never looked so good.
Perhaps most refreshing is that there is no 

token romantic subplot between the two main 
characters, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and 
Mako (Rinko Kikuchi). Instead, the emotional 
core of the movie lies in messages of together-
ness, respect and trust.  Coupled with these 
organic themes, “Pacific Rim” impresses with 
both blockbuster and critical appeal.

Most Underrated Film:
“Pacific Rim”

Some matches are made in Hollywood heaven. Others are 
not. But surely, many of us would salivate at the combination 
of first-time director Carl Rinsch taking on an ancient Japanese 
legend, a screenplay scripted by the guy who wrote “The Fast 
and the Furious” and a lead role played by Keanu Reeves.

Oh, wait. Nobody would want that.
The most important question is: Why did the film get made? 

“47 Ronin” is an adaptation of an 18th century tale about 
samurai honor and the lengths men will go to avenge their lord 
— a theme central to late medieval Japanese literature and cus-
tom. But it wasn’t white enough for Hollywood, so Reeves was 
thrown in.

Endless questions arise about this film’s production. Who 

thought an 
ancient Japanese 
legend would be 
popular if it was writ-
ten by the “The Fast and the Furious” guy? If they sought to 
accurately adapt a non-Western, non-European legend (some-
thing we’d like to see Hollywood do more often), why would 
they throw in Reeves? The film simply doesn’t understand the 
story it’s telling — it should be about men driven to fight to 
the death to avenge their master’s honor; instead, it’s about 
Keanu Reeves finding his place in the world. The movie moguls 
at Universal Pictures began with an excellent story, but they 
slapped a brand-name star on it and left out the heart.

The “Sadder Keanu” Award: 
“47 Ronin”

Baz Luhrmann’s adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel 
“The Great Gatsby” takes all the wrong kinds of liberties. The 
novel explores the Jazz Age, a land of economic excess where 
you can afford to throw your silk shirts into the air like confetti 
and pour your leftover champagne into the swimming pool. 
Fitzgerald provides a lucid account of the frivolous attitude 
that tipped the nation into the Great Depression. 

Luhrmann’s film, on the other hand, shoves the silk shirts 
into our mouths and washes them down with the cheap thrill 
of overwrought 3-D technology. The camera melodramati-
cally zooms in and out of the frame until we begin to wonder 
what kind of camera would permit such abuse. Meanwhile, the 
screenplay, written by Luhrmann and his favorite screenwriter 

Craig Pearce (his counterpart in both “Romeo + Juliet” and 
“Moulin Rouge!”), simply regurgitates the novel. Only when 
it comes to music does Luhrmann decide to take a stab at 
originality. And suddenly, we realize why he hesitated 
before opening his Pandora’s box of creativity. The 
soundtrack, produced by Jay-Z, is an oversexed hip-
hop that stumbles awkwardly between Lana del Rey 
and Beyonce.

On the whole, this film caters to the viewer 
who prefers an overexposed, postcardish view of 
history — featuring airbrushed flappers and the 
most flamboyant speakeasy of all time — to a 
full panorama of the Roaring Twenties.

Beardiest Film:
“The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug”

When in battle with a fierce dragon, “The Hobbit: The Desolation of 
Smaug,” proves that the best way to fight is with great swordsmanship 
— and an even better beard.

While Gandalf ’s (Ian McKellen) long facial hair clearly symbolizes his 
sophistication, 12 other dwarves, all with tongue-twisting names, show 
they can intimidate with armor and style as they go on their quest through 
Middle Earth. Two dwarves in particular, Gloin (Peter Hambleton) and 
Bifur (William Kircher), add accessories to their whiskers, and their facial 
hair serves both as fashion and defense. Gloin accessorizes his beard with 
beads to create a cleaner look, but it’s also practical — his beard stays out of 

the way during an attack. Similarly, Bifur adds feathers to his beard, making 
for both a bold statement and a distraction for Smaug.

Besides intimidation, the bearded bunch uses their facial hair 
to display their confidence. A shout-out goes to Dwalin (Graham 
McTavish), who proves that a bald scalp can be overshadowed by an 
impressive flow of hair off of the chin. The dwarves prove that what 
they lack in size, they make up for into the grandest of follicular 
heroism. While the story is engaging either way, it’s worth wonder-
ing where the hobbits, elves, dwarves, wizards and goblins of “The 
Hobbit” would be without their beards.

Most Underrated Performance:
Oscar Isaac, “Inside Llewyn Davis”

Oscar Isaac seemed destined for an Academy Award nomination 
for his lead role in the Coen brothers’ period drama “Inside Llewyn 
Davis.” Isaac’s performance garnered acclaim and accolades through-
out the year — a Golden Globe nomination included. Portraying the 
fictitious folk singer Llewyn Davis in 1960s Greenwich Village, New 
York, Isaac effortlessly creates a complex and understated character 
attempting to make his voice known within the burgeoning folk scene. 
Davis’s life is stuck in a constant cycle of disappointment — despite 
his talent, he seems to fail at every opportunity for success — and 
Isaac is able to convey grief and depression to create a morally ambig-

uous character the audience can relate to. Isaac also lends his own 
singing voice to the music in the film, adding a layer of realism and 
depth to the character. When he sings the traditional folk song “Hang 
Me, Oh Hang Me” while contemplating suicide at a bar gig, it feels like 
an authentic cry for a way out of his stagnated life.

Llewyn Davis exists in a drab, uneventful world that only lets him 
down, a fact made ever-present by Isaac’s solemn, sobering perfor-
mance. Although not as showy as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio’s portrayal 
of Jordan Belfort in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Isaac still puts forth a 
performance that is muted but surprisingly engrossing.

And This 
Is How It 
Feels, As
We Go On

I     want to start off by saying some-thing that might be strange, but it’s something I know I’ll be saying a 
lot in the near future, and that is:

Goodbye.
Whew! That felt good. You know, 

people (the smart ones) were right 
when they said you should just go out 
and get things off your chest, because 
it does make you feel better. People 
(still the smart ones) were also right 
when they said that goodbye never 
gets easier; that even if hate is the 
introductory emotion to something, 
then by some cruel twist of existence, 
things get more enjoyable, or more 
bearable, as time goes on. Sentiments 
are cultivated in your brain. And then 
goodbyes become difficult.

I didn’t start out liking UCSD. I 
wanted to go to a small, hip liberal arts 
college in Washington — or, as I saw 
it, Coolsville, USA. I was prepared to 
say farewell to my lifetime home and 
go to a place that probably didn’t even 
have Takis™ given its considerable dis-
tance from the border of Mexico.

But because of budgetary concerns 
and familial pressure, I opted for what 
angry teen-me called UC So Dumb, 
which I was not okay with. But slowly, 
the idea became tolerable: I realized 
I could walk to the beach, that one of 
my best friends would also be there 
and that I would probably not be the 
nerdiest kid at a research university 
(my enormous sense of self-doubt 
prevents me from giving my coolness 
even the smallest shred of plausibil-
ity) (not to brag). I even got kind of 
into UCSD at orientation, save for 
the amount of time they allotted to 
rehearse synchronized jazz hands for 
UnOlympics. (Disclaimer: I enjoy and 
am skilled at jazz-handing, but I see it 
as more of an independent activity)

Then I started taking classes, 
enjoying my major, making friends, 
joining clubs, taking naps in lounges 
and buying coffee from the cool 
Mandeville coffee cart, and sentiments 
grew like weeds in my mind, and 
before I knew it, I was getting emails 
about “taking senior portraits” and 
“applying to graduation” and “enlarge-
ing my bratworst.” I realized that I 
would miss this bundle of buildings 
established as an institution of higher 
education. I knew then that say-
ing goodbye, even to the beachfront 
retiree community of La Jolla, would 
be hard. I also suspected that the day 
before graduation would be spent vis-
iting various cherished campus spots, 
crying and singing Vitamin C’s semi-
nal hit “Graduation (Friends Forever).”

If four years of seeing some of the 
closest friends come and go has taught 
me anything, it’s that saying goodbye 
is best done deliberately and farewell-
induced regret can be minimized by 
giving that person or thing the sendoff 
you think they deserve (ice cream and 
sitcoms help, too). There’s no grand 
ritual for saying goodbye, just mak-
ing sure that you do the things you’ve 
always wanted to with them.

Admittedly, this column is 
extremely self-indulgent, as saying 
“goodbye” has never been easy, espe-
cially for someone who tears up at 
the Sarah McLachlan-accompanied 
montage that plays in his head when 
he throws old sneakers away. But writ-
ing through these feelings will help 
me (and hopefully readers like you) 
to work through the transition from 
student-hood to young adulthood. 
And because of some fumbled con-
tract writing, I will be required to plug 
Takis™ brand snacks in every column.

So, class of 2014, get ready. Take 
my hand, and we’ll journey toward life 
together. I’m sorry that my palms are 
covered in delicious Takis™ seasoning.

T his week, the UCSD Guardian takes you out for what you need the most: a coffee break.
Coffee shops in San Diego are 

a dime a dozen, but every so often, 
you’ll find a coffee shop whose 
charm leaves you coming back for 
more. Hidden amongst the giant, 
Spanish-style homes of Mission 
Hills, Espresso Mio is not in the 
most convenient location for the 
average UCSD student. It’s the place 
you go to get away from it all.

Just a 15-minute drive away from 
campus in the historic neighborhood 
of Mission Hills, you’ll find coffee, 
tea and serenity. Espresso Mio offers 
a peaceful environment that pro-
vides a blissful change of pace from 
the hustle and bustle of the average, 
over-caffeinated coffee shop.

Friendly, homey vibes, free Wi-Fi 
and rich coffee make Espresso Mio a 
gem among the generic coffee shops 
of San Diego. Inside, rustic, red walls 
and paintings of small, Italian cities 
lining the walls make the interior 
feel like a friend’s living room. The 
front patio is lined with tables and 
umbrellas, which are perfect for 
chatting with friends. If you’re look-
ing for a tranquil environment to 
get some work done and enjoy your 
drink alone, the back patio that sits 
up high overlooking a eucalyptus-
lined canyon is ideal. 

The menu features a number 

of traditional espresso beverages, 
house-blend drip coffee ($1.95) 
and specialty tea drinks. For a mid-
morning espresso drink, try the 
cappuccino ($3.95) or the macchiato 
($2.50), which has less milk than a 
cappuccino but the same dollop of 
foam on top. For tea drinkers, there 
is a variety of traditional and special-
ty teas drinks like the white guava 
ginger tea ($2.50) and the cherry-
rose green tea ($2.50). All drinks are 
served in ceramic mugs that look 
like they came straight out of your 
mom’s pantry. The mugs are in no 
way uniform; some are short, some 
tall, and they come in all sorts of col-
ors and designs adding to the quaint 
mom-and-pop-shop feel. There is 
also a vast array of vegan and gluten-
free baked goods like the pumpkin 
bread ($2.50) and the coconut 
apricot walnut bar ($2.50). For the 
traditionalist, they have good, old-
fashioned, chewy chocolate-chip 
cookies (2 for $2.50). The only catch 
is that you have to get there early for 
baked goods because they go fast. 

Espresso Mio isn’t just a local 
favorite for its quality coffee and 
vibe; it’s a favorite because it’s one 
of the few places that lets customers 
keep a tab because you’ll be back for 
more sooner than you know it.

Tucked away on Convoy Street of 
San Diego’s Kearny Mesa, the quaint 
Up2You Cafe is packed almost every 
night with customers clamoring for 
their specialty desserts, refreshing 
drinks and fun lounge area.

For the full Up2You experience, 
dine in. Drinks are served in Mason 
jars, and, despite the plastic-only 
utensils available, your order comes 
beautifully assembled on a porcelain 
plate. Ordering to-go, however, com-
partmentalizes your order’s different 
components, which is disappointing 
for those who desire the aesthetics.

Like the title says, your choices for 
dessert customization are completely 
up to you — the quantities of your 
add-ons determine your final cost. 
Up2You offers three, main customiz-
able specialties: Honey Brick Toast 
($3.75), Crepes ($3.50) and Belgian 
Waffles ($3.50), the former being 
most popular. Imagine a block of 
honey-kissed, white toast, partially 
segmented into nine pieces and then 
set to crisp and caramelize in a toaster 
oven. Once done, the customer’s 
requested add-ons (your choice 
between different kinds and quanti-
ties of spreads —Nutella, dulce de 
leche, nut butters, etc.— fruits and ice 
cream) are applied. 

It’s much more rewarding to be 
impetuous with your order combina-

tion instead of planning it out while 
waiting in line. Being adventurous 
with your combination allows you to 
not only enjoy the full satisfaction of 
the comprehensive taste, but also the 
feeling of success from your spontane-
ous selections. No brick toast combi-
nation has ever been unsatisfactory. 

Some preset desserts are offered 
as well, such as creme brulees, banana 
splits and tiramisus. Their Banoffee 
Sundae ($6.25) is like a banana split 
with a crunch — crumbled Oreos 
topped with banana slices, dulce de 
leche, a scoop of your choice of ice 
cream, whipped cream and cocoa 
powder. A phenomenal play on tex-
tures is all served in a latched, airtight 
jar. Like the food, the decor is colorful 
and quirky. The muted, deep colors 
give a sense of being calm, yet invigo-
rating. Some walls have painted piec-
es, some have various framed graph-
ics. The furniture is mixed from old 
lounge-style couches and ottomans 
around coffee tables to simple chairs 
and Bauhaus-style stools around 
seemingly old wood tables imprinted 
with a gold, lotus-like design and clut-
tered with different carvings etched by 
previous customers.

As for drinks, the popular house 
drinks — Up2You Milk Tea, Matcha 
Green Tea, Thai Tea — are best 
enjoyed with Honey Boba, extra-sweet 
boba coated in a light layer of honey, 
for an additional $0.50. The Up2You 
Milk Tea is not to be missed — its 

earthier taste gives it the flavor depth 
of Thai tea.

Most nights, seating is hard to 
come by, and although Up2You is 
well-staffed, their service can get slow. 
In comparison, during the day it’s 
quiet and relaxed enough to use as a 
study space or nice place to meet up 
with a friend for a small snack-and-
chat (The service is much faster, too). 
But no matter at what time of day, 
you’ll always get patient and friendly 
assistance, even if you’re having a 
hard time deciding what to order.
Up2You Cafe is not common for 
evening studying because of its social 

environment but definitely a better 
place to unwind with a small group 
of friends. The ambiance is fun and 
social without a party of one in sight. 
From table to table, you’ll see people 
enjoying their drinks, trying each 
other’s desserts or simply chatting and 
playing available games (i.e. Jenga, 
Uno, Cranium, playing cards, etc.) 
while waiting for their order and/or 
after they’ve finished eating. How you 
spend your time (and your money) is 
truly up to you.

Don’t be deceived: “The Who and the What” is a com-
edy, but it also opens up discussion about Islamic culture by 
exploring a Muslim-American woman’s struggle to navigate 
her traditional roots and the contemporary society she lives 
in. But just as Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ayad Akhtar has 
done in past works, it leaves you in emotional shambles and 
does so with justice. “The Who and the What” teems with 
one liners (jokes range from quips about emoticons to sexual 
innuendos), cultural insight and TV-worthy staging.

At first, the play doesn’t seem like a comedy, but the ris-
ing action generates witty sparks. The main character, Zarina 
(Monika Jolly), a writer in her 30s, is a snarky, headstrong, 
progressive feminist in a conservative, Muslim household — 
and this juxtaposition tills the field for both hilarious antics 
and serious underlying commentary. She constantly bickers 
with her younger sister Mahwish (Meera Kumbhani) and 
father Afzal (Bernard White), who pressure Zarina to get 
married, so Mahwish, too, can find a husband. To combat 
Zarina’s indifference to marriage, Afzal poses as his daughter 
online to screen potential suitors. He stumbles across Muslim 

convert Eli (Kai Lennox), and when he arranges for the two to 
meet, Zarina takes to him immediately.

With Zarina happily dating Eli, her family thinks she’s 
on the right track — or the one they want her to be on, at 
least. But what Mahwish and Afzal don’t know is that Zarina 
is writing a book about the prophet Muhammad and his 
encounters with his wives — one that is sexually explicit and, 
more importantly, portrays Muhammad in a blasphemous 
light. Inevitably, Zarina’s family discovers her book, setting her 
ideology leagues apart from her family’s.

As Zarina’s literary creation exposes itself, the tension rises, 
and sassy, lighthearted quips about marriage are replaced with 
anger and betrayal. Each character reveals their true self, leav-
ing the audience frozen in anticipation of what will happen 
next. It’s dynamic, tear-jerking and heartbreaking to see the 
surface humor barrel toward inevitable detonation.

The synergy between the dialogue and staging is so 
immaculate that the transitions make the production feel 
like a live sitcom, allowing the audience to focus solely on 
the actors’ spectacular performances. The set shifts between 
various sets in a matter of seconds with “How I Met Your 
Mother”-esque transition music that throws us into a new 
argument — one second, we’re in a well-lit kitchen, and the 
scene dims into a romantic date in the next. The only trou-
bling concern is the continuity of time — the play jumps years 
forward between scenes with little warning. Luckily, the cast 
optimizes the script in their delivery, so the rapid progression 
isn’t too disruptive.

With strong anatomy in writing, directing and acting, 
“The Who and the What” offers a glimpse into the breach 
between conservative and progressive values. But at its roots, 
it’s a comedy that is sure to leave both a memorable experi-
ence and even more to discuss.

is, as there are only 13 teams in the 
conference. Since Ring took over 
in 2005, the team has averaged a 
10.9th-place finish. Ring’s career 
winning percentage, not including 
this year’s, is a disappointing .287 — 
hardly better than the .223 that pre-
vious coach Ron Larsen 
recorded between 2000 
and 2005.

Ring is a former 
Triton player himself, 
and was named MPSF 
Coach of the Year in 
2009 for reasons that 
don’t quite make sense 
to us. He has deep 
roots in the UCSD 
community, having 
earned both a B.S. in 
biochemistry from 
UCSD in 1996 and 
an M.S. in chemistry 
in 1998. But despite 
the coach’s decades-old relation-
ship with UCSD, the Athletic 
Department owes it to the vol-
leyball program and the university 
to find a coaching staff for the 
team that better reflects the Triton 
“Tradition of Excellence.”

Of the three UCSD teams that 

compete among other elite institu-
tions at the Division I level, men’s 
volleyball is the only team floun-
dering. Men’s water polo routinely 
makes the cut for the highly com-
petitive NCAA tournament and is 
ranked 10 out of 20 in the NCAA. 
The team also went to the National 
Championships this year, and 

coach Denny Harper, 
whose 34-year coach-
ing tenure has seen a 
.574 win percentage, 
was named WWPA 
Coach of the Year for 
the 2013–14 season. 
Perhaps due in part 
to the Tritons’ suc-
cesses in water polo, 
the NCAA announced 
in December that the 
Canyonview Aquatics 
Center would serve 
as the site of the next 
championship. And 
fencing has seen 

similar success — at the November 
2013 North/South Duals in Irvine, 
Calif., for instance, UCSD men’s 
and women’s fencing beat out 
Division-I contenders UCLA, UC 
Irvine, UC Santa Barbara and USC.

Water polo and fencing’s 
impressive performances prove 

that Triton success in Division-I 
is possible and can even be seen 
as an expectation — even with-
out full athletic scholarships. If 
the Athletic Department is seri-
ous about making a push toward 
achieving Division-I status for all 
its programs, it needs to start acting 
like it, and that may mean a new 
coach. USC men’s basketball fired 
head coach Kevin O’Neill midway 
through its 2012–13 season after 
the team recorded a 48–65 overall 
record, far stronger than the 4–20 
Ring recorded in 2012–13. Instead 
of being content with hovering at 
the bottom of the NCAA, UCSD 
should see the team’s Division-I 
standing as something to aspire to.

UCSD’s hesitance to let unsuc-
cessful coaches go is not at all 
indicative of an athletic department 
that is committed to winning, let 
alone hanging up championship 
banners in RIMAC. Strong athletic 
performances can increase school 
spirit, alumni investment in the 
university and can help make us 
proud to be UCSD students. If 
UCSD is as committed to improv-
ing its programs across the board, 
then it may be time to rethink 
Coach Ring’s future with the Triton 
volleyball program.

used for award ceremonies and 
public relations. “Inclusion” now 
has no equity component because it 
lacks historical grounding. By strip-
ping those terms of their original 
meanings, they become corporate 
buzzwords that can be packaged 
and easily exchanged without 
structural change ever taking place. 
They become a decorative piece of 
UCSD’s new “brand” in order to 
fool the public.

Four years later, the organiza-
tional disarray of UCSD’s “diversity” 
infrastructure has yet to be rectified. 
Countless committees, councils and 
task forces still exist with each operat-
ing in a vacuum. The Climate Council 
mandated by former UC President 
Yudof continues to meet with “com-
munity members,” but because there 
are no coherent action plans or work 
groups nothing is accomplished. The 
sudden departure of Vice Chancellor 
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Linda 
Greene creates another vacuum into 
which a professor without expertise 
in diversity in higher education (a 
real academic discipline with a vast 
scholarly literature) is forced to “do 
the best she can.” No advisory group 
made up of staff, students and faculty 
with experience in relevant issues has 

been formed to assist the VC-EDI. 
The VC-EDI office still has no dedi-
cated development officer (In fact, 
since 2010 two highly skilled devel-
opment officers were hired but soon 
disappeared — one fired; the other 
departed out of frustration).

We applaud Chancellor Khosla’s 
attempts to increase access for local 
students from historically excluded 
communities. But as the student activ-
ists asked four years ago, what kind of 
campus environment is awaiting these 
new students? First and foremost, is 
there an effective support structure to 
ensure their academic success? Has 
the climate substantially improved 
since 2010, especially for Black and 
Brown students, so that new students 
will not have to experience the same 
alienation that has plagued the cam-
pus for over 50 years? As Dr. King 
once remarked: “Integration, yes, but 
not integration into a burning house.”

Because the UCSD administration 
continues to lack an objective analysis 
of the racial/gender landscape, their 
“solutions” too often stop at the emo-
tional level. Hostile climate for them 
is the result of individual student 
unhappiness or over-sensitivity. In 
fact, “diversity officers” are happy to 
focus on “micro-aggressions” precisely 

because it allows them to ignore the 
causes of the macro-hostility against 
Black and Brown students that perme-
ate the campus environment. 

We call upon Chancellor Khosla 
and Executive Vice Chancellor 
Subramani to mandate the formation 
of an advisory group for the VC-EDI. 
Members of the group should not be 
appointed randomly by title but by 
their level of experience working on 
equity and “diversity” issues at UCSD 
over the last several years. This group 
will help to formulate a draft “diversi-
ty” strategic plan that will be available 
to the permanent VC-EDI when she/
he is hired. 

It has been four years since the 
agreement signed by Chancellor 
Fox with the Black Student Union, 
seven years since the submission 
of a detailed report on yield with 
specific recommendations and 10 
years since the first Chief Diversity 
Officer was named. A full decade 
has been lost at UCSD with regard 
to the most pressing problems for 
historically excluded communities. 
Is it any wonder that only those 
who are drunk on institutional 
Kool-Aid can take seriously UCSD’s 
claim that “things will be different 
this time?”

“...Despite the

the Athletic Department 
owes it to the volleyball

Nearly 300 competitors gathered 
on Fiesta Island in Mission Bay last 
weekend to take part in the eighth 
annual Tritonman Triathlon. 

Put on by the 15-man UCSD 
triathlon team, the event stretched 
across two days. Starting at 7 a.m. 
on Saturday, Feb. 22, University of 
Arizona’s Ben Kanute won the draft-
legal competition. The following day, 
283 racers took part in the traditional 

rules triathlon, won by UCSD SIO 
graduate student William Jones.

“I think we did really well, and we 
had a couple great showings,” UCSD 
triathlon captain Bryce Zaffarano said. 

Teams from across California came 
to participate in the event, includ-
ing UCLA, Cal, Stanford, Cal Poly 
and UC Santa Barbara. According to 
Zaffarano the event drew nearly 100 
more competitors than it did last year 
and welcomed a number of profes-
sional athletes as well as one paratri-
athlete, Mary Kate Callahan from the 

University of Arizona.
Zaffarano said next year the event 

will be certified for more paratriath-
letes to take part in.

This weekend, the UCSD triathlon 
team will compete at UCLA. 

Zaffarano said he hopes UCSD 
— which placed in the top-10 in the 
national meet last year — will place 
in the top-five in this year’s meet on 
April 3.

the third game of the series and 
retired batters in separate eight and 
12 streaks. 

Scott initiated a crucial around-
the-bases triple play in the ninth 
after a Bronco single to maintain 
the Triton 3–4 lead. Just after, CPP 
managed a two-run single to give 
the Broncos a 5–4 advantage going 
into the bottom half. 

The Tritons capitalized on a 
series of walks to load the bases 
with no outs. A fly from Rahn to 
right field set up a Broncos double 
play, but UCSD advanced a runner 
to third in the play to set up a steal 
for the tying run. Cruz, now on 
first, broke for second and drew the 
throw while sophomore outfielder 
Gradeigh Sanchez stole home for 
the tying score.

A few pitches later, the Tritons 
sent the winning run home after a 
walk-off single to center for a 6–5 
final score.

UCSD was defeated 6–4 in the 
final game of the series, after the 
Tritons allowed a 4–1 lead slip away 
in the seventh. Cruz (1–1) was cred-
ited with the loss after allowing five 
runs on six hits across six frames 
for his second start on the mound 

in 2014.
After coming out even with 

the CCAA’s top contender at the 
moment, it is hard to accept such 
close losses that could have been 
tallied in the win column. A failure 
to capitalize on opportunities late in 
games caused the Tritons to split a 
crucial in-conference series, despite 
having built momentum on their 
early season success.

“I don’t question our toughness,” 
UCSD head coach Eric Newman 
said to UCSD Athletics Department 
last Saturday, Feb. 22. “Our guys 
came out, and they competed. I 
mean, this was a grind-it-out series 
for both teams.”

UCSD continues CCAA action 
on Friday, Feb. 28 against Sonoma 
State in a four-game series at Triton 
Ballpark. The Tritons will come off 
what could have been an in-con-
ference sweep and attempt to break 
.500 in the CCAA for the first time 
in the young 2014 season.

“I think we’re a force to be reck-
oned with,” Newman told UCSD 
Athletics Department. “I think it 
stings, it should sting, and we need 
to respond.”

TOTALS 

UCSD to Face CSU Long Beach, UC Irvine This Weekend

played well in the first half, and we 
just lost some steam from the end of 
the third and into the fourth quarter.” 

The following day, the Tritons 
appeared overwhelmed playing 
against Arizona State, as the Sun 
Devils shut UCSD out in the first half 
while scoring five times themselves.

Though the Tritons nearly 
matched Arizona State in scoring 
throughout the second half (5–4), 
their lackluster start ultimately pre-
vented any possibility of climbing 
back into the match. 

In their fourth and final match of 
the weekend, the Tritons started off 

strong against Cal State Northridge, 
finding the back of the cage three 
times in the first quarter and closing 
out the half with a 5–4 advantage. 

However, in the third quarter, the 
Tritons were held scoreless, giving 
the lead to the Matadors who scored 
three times. In the final quarter, both 
squads scored a pair of goals, as the 
Tritons failed to regain their edge 
and fell 9–7.

Guiliana, along with sophomore 
defense Alexis Wieseler and junior 
attacker Rachel Brooks led UCSD 
with two goals, while Miller finished 
with 17 saves. 

“Things just weren’t going the 
way we wanted,” Lizotte said. “Our 

offensive side just wasn’t working for 
us [on Sunday], but that’s going to 
happen. The takeaway is that we see 
some things offensively we need to 
work on.”  

The Tritons will remain on the 
road and are slated to face non-con-
ference opponents No. 12 Cal State 
Long Beach and No. 5 UC Irvine 
Friday, Feb. 28 and Saturday, Feb. 29. 

“I think we have the potential to 
beat both teams, so I’m excited to 
play.” Lizotte said. “All of this is prep-
aration for NCAAs, and that’s where 
we see ourselves at the end of all this.”

Softball Alumni Head NCAA Teams UCSD Goes 2–2 in Series 
With Cal Poly Pomona

SOFTBALL BASEBALL 

Boise State, Utah Valley and Cal State Dominguez Hills coaches have UCSD roots.

The Tritons (7–5) split a four-game series against the 
previously undefeated, CCAA-leading Mustangs.

UCSD is known to have a proud 
tradition of academic and athletic 
excellence, but what is not always well 
broadcasted, is the long list of student-
athletes who have gone on to begin 
careers as NCAA coaches.

UCSD softball alumni Erin 
Bridges-Thorpe (class of 2000), Kim 
Aggabao (class of 2004), and Nikki 
Palmer (class of 2007), all outstanding 
former Tritons, played softball under 
UCSD head coach Patti Gerckens — 
now in her 21st season — and have 
all gone on to become top-class col-
legiate coaches. 

Bridges-Thorpe graduated with 
a Bachelor’s degree in economics 
and management science in 2000 
and went on to earn an MBA from 
Cal Poly Pomona in 2008. She was 
named four times to the NCAA All-
West Region team, finished her career 
with NCAA All-American honors 
and was selected as the UCSD Female 
Athlete of the Year. 

The first full-time collegiate coach-
ing gig for Thorpe was at Whittier 
College in Whittier, Calif. from 2002 
to 2007. Thorpe made the jump up to 
Division I when she was hired as the 
head coach of the newly started soft-
ball program at Boise State University 
in September 2007, where she remains 
in charge today. Bridges-Thorpe led 
the Broncos to their most success-
ful finish to date in 2012 when the 
team snagged a 34–20 record during 
their first season as a member of the 
Mountain West conference, finishing 
in  second place. 

Nikki Palmer — another UCSD 
softball player now coaching at the 
Division I level — graduated in 2007 
with a B.A. in sociology and later went 
on to earn an M.A. in teaching. She 
was hired by Coach Gerckens as an 
assistant coach in the year following 
her graduation. 

“Coaching alongside Coach G. was 

immediately eye-opening,” Palmer 
said. “I learned the other side of the 
game that I previously did not give 
much thought to. Ultimately, Coach 
gave me the boost and experience I 
needed to push me into the full time 
coaching career that I have today.” 

After five years at UCSD, Palmer 
became a journeyman. From 2008 
to 2010 Palmer moved up the coast 
to become an assistant coach at San 
Francisco State. Palmer later moved 
on to coach at Utah State University, 
before working with Weber State 
University. Palmer got her first 

head coaching gig at Utah Valley 
University.

The Utah Valley Wolverines are 
currently 0–8. Coincidentally, Palmer’s 
most recent defeat came at the hands 
of none other than Coach Thorpe’s 
Boise State Broncos in an 8–1 loss this 
past weekend.

Former Triton Kim Aggabao spent 
nine years as an assistant coach for 
Division I programs.

Upon graduating from UCSD in 
2004 with a degree in biology, Aggabao 
began her coaching career as an assis-
tant coach with the University of San 
Diego Toreros.

“My four years as a student-athlete 
at UCSD were some of the best years 
of my life,” Aggabao said. “I am so 
grateful for that opportunity to receive 
a great education and also play a sport 
that I love.”

During her time at UCSD, 
Aggabao spent four years as a starter 
for the Triton infield. She was a three-
time First Team All-CCAA selection 
and CCAA MVP, as well as an All-
West Region selection in her senior 

year in 2004.
Aggabao attributes much of her 

success to the guidance she received 
from Coach Gerckens. 

“She has played a major role in 
my growth as a coach,” Aggabao said. 
“Gerckens is someone I can rely on if I 
ever have a question or [need] advice.”

After her stint as an assistant at 
USD, Aggabao went on to become 
the head coach at South Dakota State 
University, but her time in South 
Dakota was cut short when an oppor-
tunity to return to the CCAA pre-
sented itself, and she was hired as the 

head coach at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills for the current 2013–2014 
softball season.

The Toros, a past rival of UCSD 
softball, hosted the West Regionals 
in 2012 against the Tritons who 
came back to win the series and 
move on to their National Runner 
Up finish in the NCAA Division II 

Nationals that year. 
Since then, a program rivalry 

between the Tritons and Toros has 
been apparent, and now with a Triton 
alum at the helm of CSUDH, the com-
petition is sure to be stiff this year. The 
Toros are currently 6–2 and sit one 
spot behind the Tritons in first place 
in the CCAA. 

“My coaching philosophy is priori-
tized into four areas: academics, ath-
letics, service and life skills. It’s impor-
tant to me that my student-athletes 
excel in each of those areas,” Aggabao 
told the UCSD Athletics Department. 

But the legacy of former play-
ers turned softball coaches doesn’t 
end with Aggabao. Kris Lesovsky and 
Camille Gaito, both 2012 graduates, 
were brought on as assistant coaches 
for the 2014 season. Both members of 
the National Championship team in 
2011 and National Runner-Up team 
in 2012, they are back to help lead the 
team to another strong season. 

The Tritons handed No. 15 Cal 
Poly Pomona its first two losses of 
the year in a 2–2 series split this 
past weekend. Previously undefeat-
ed, Pomona lost the first game to 
UCSD on its home field before the 
second game of the series ran to 11 
innings and was suspended due to 
darkness. UCSD returned to Triton 
Ballpark on Saturday to resume play, 
dropping the suspended game to 
Pomona and winning one in the 
afternoon doubleheader. 

UCSD now moves to 7–6 overall 
and 4–4 in CCAA action.

The Triton bats gave Cal Poly 
Pomona sophomore Max Bethell 
trouble on the mound early in game 
one as the first four Tritons Bethell 
faced earned hits against the previ-
ously 3–0 southpaw. Senior catcher 
Nick La Face zipped a two-run sin-
gle down the left field line and gave 
UCSD an early advantage. 

In the bottom of the first inning, 
sophomore right-hander Justin 

Donatella took the mound for 
UCSD, allowing only two runs on 
four hits and three walks, while 
retiring 11 straight batters from the 
second frame to the sixth. Junior 
catcher Brett Levy threw out a 
potential steal for the first time 
in the 2014 campaign in the first 
inning. The Triton defense also 
turned two double plays to take the 
4–2 win in the low-scoring game.

The second game of the series 
was suspended due to darkness after 
UCSD lost a four-run lead after two 
RBI performances from sophomore 
third baseman Troy Cruz and senior 
leftfielder Justin Rahn, leaving the 
game tied 7–7 in the 10th inning. 
Play ended at Triton Ballpark the 
following day after Cal Poly’s Trevor 
Magno hit a walk-off RBI single in 
the bottom of the 11th inning for an 
8–7 Cal Poly win. 

The regularly scheduled double-
header followed the end of Friday’s 
resumption play.

“We’ve had a track record of not playing 
well in overtime games, so this was a nice 

tournament and a good win for us.” 
–UCSD Head Coach Corrie Falcon

T he No. 11 UCSD women’s water polo team suffered a tough string of losses against strong opponents this past weekend, going 1–3 and finishing eighth 
at the UC Irvine Invitational. The Tritons started off 
strong, upsetting No. 6 Hawaii 10–9, before dropping 
their next three matches to No. 3 UCLA, No. 7 Arizona 
State and No. 10 Cal State Northridge by scores of 6–8, 
4–10 and 7–9 respectively. UCSD now stands at 10–6 
overall on the season.

On Saturday, the Tritons’ first contest against the 
University of Hawaii was a nail-biter. With the match 
tight throughout, junior attacker Jolene Guiliana secured 
the victory for UCSD, netting her third goal from the 
wing in sudden death overtime. 

Neither squad ever led by more than three points, 
as both the Tritons and Rainbow Wahine continuously 
exchanged goals for the majority of the match. 

After a hard-fought final quarter, Hawaii forced 
extra play with only 46 seconds remaining; but UCSD 
sophomore attacker Laurel Kistler drew an ejection in 
overtime play, giving the Tritons a six-on-five advantage 
and allowing Guiliana to find the back of the cage. 

“We had a game plan, we executed [it], and it was a 
great game,” senior utility Sarah Lizotte said. “We’ve had 
a track record of not playing well in overtime games, so 
this was a nice turnaround and a good win for us.”

Sophomore goalie Courtney Miller recorded 20 saves 
for the Tritons, while senior center Melissa Bartow led 
the Tritons with four goals. Lizotte and sophomore 
attacker Julia Kirkland both tallied hat tricks as well. 

In their subsequent Saturday contest, the Tritons 
appeared to eye a second consecutive upset against 
UCLA, until a poor second half gave the Bruins the win. 

UCSD led 5–3 at halftime but could only net one 
more goal in the final two quarters, while UCLA picked 
up five to close out the match 8–6. 

Lizotte noted the Tritons’ fatigue as a key factor in 
UCSD’s loss.

“We only had about a one-hour break in between 
our first and second game,” Lizotte said. “It’s really hard 
to bounce back from an overtime game and play a team 
that’s No. 3 in the nation. I think it was a great game. We
