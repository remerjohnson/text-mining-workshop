Reg Fee Votes to 
Move EOP, OASIS 
to AcadeDlic Affairs 
Armitage Must Now Approve 
Reduction of Own Authority 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

An administrative transfer of both the Educational 
Opportunity Program and the Office of Academic Support for 
Instructional Services received overwhelming support yesterday 
from the Reg Fee Committee, which hoped the move would aid 
in minority student recruitment. 

In a reversal of last week's informal opposition to the move, 
the committee voted 11-1 to recommend the programs be 
transferred from Student Affairs to Academic Affairs to Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard Armitage and Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs Paul Saltman. 

The vote came after confusion was cleared up over Reg Fees'

Financial Aid, in the

committee members agreed 
they probably would not vote

three programs before making 
their final decision. 

Confession 
In Liebrenz 
Murder Case 

By Meg Honda 
Eric Lauterbach, 18-year old son 

of the slain Leon Lauterbach, is being 
held on $500,000 bail after confessing 
to the San Diego police of planning the 
Sept. 3 murders of his father and 
UCSD Career Planning Counselor 
Gloria Liebrenz. Also being detained 
for allegedly committing the murder, is 
a 17 -year old friend of young 
Lauterbach's. 

Homicide investigator Ted Armijo 
said that the investigating team 
suspected the two "since the night of 
the murder." Lauterbach was 
apprehended Oct. 4. The friend came 
in with his attorney the_next day. 

Armijo said that the arrests came 
after "talking to a lot of people" and 
otherwise going to "great lengths using 
polygraphs and such" to uncover 
enough evidence relating the two 
suspects to the murders. 

A preliminary trial is pending' at the 
end of the month. 

The committee was most 
concerned about EOP, which . 
has come under fire from 
various groups recentJy for 
alleged inefficiency and for Harold Tenvner 
failing to attract sufficient 
numbers of minority students to UCSD. 

A task force that studied the proposal this summer concluded 
EOP could operate better if placed under the same control as the 
Office for Relations with other Schools, which also recruits 
minority students and is run by academic affairs. 

After listening to comments from Third College Provost 
Watson, who chaired the task force, Vice Chancellor or 
Admissions Harold Temmer, and EOP staff member Carlos 
Encinas, the committee agreed that a transfer of EOP would 
benefit campus minority recruitment. This was a change from 
last week, when most members expressed doubt that a transfer 
of control would significantJy improve recruitment. 

T emmer, who as ORS director would be most directly 
affected by the EOP switch , supported the committee 's decision, 
saying minority recruitment would be better coordinated as a 
result. If some kind of change were not made in current EOP 
operations, enrollment could drop by as much as 1,600 students

Dingy Cafe Allows Young Chinese 
To Unwind - A Cultural Experiment 

By VICTORIA GRAHAM 
Associated Press Writer 

The liveliest nightspot in town is a 
shabby cafe where hundreds of young 
Chinese smoke expensive cigarettes, 
eat hot dogs and ice cream sundaes , 
guzzle beer and champagne and let off 
steam. 

A Chinese girl, her hair curled by a 
permanent, her lips blushing with a hint 
of lipstick, boldly smokes a cigarette 
and warms to the admiration of a 
lonely African. 

A 35-year-old philosophy student 
eagerly asks Westerners about HE!8eJ 
and Kant and such films as "The 
Sound of Music" and the vintage 
"Waterloo Bridge." 

A 24-year-old student with a brash 
lost-generation air downs tumbler after 
tumbler of a potion of beer and Chinese 
champagne. He boasts his father will 
buy him anything he wants. He wants a 
tape recorder - at any price. 

Cafes like thi existed in China 

before Communist Party radicals 
cracked down on fun and frolic 14 
years ago. After years of austerity , this 
down-at-the -heels rendezvous is 
something of an experiment, officially 
condoned for the present. 

The brightly lit cafe, with no real 
name but known as the Peace Hotel 
Cafe because it adjoins the hostelry, 
has been open since Jan. I. More 
like a soda fountain than a bar, it is a 
meeting ground for Chinese and . 
foreigners. 

The sometimes raucous room is 
filled with tudents, laborers, 
professionals, the unemployed and 
bored-looking youth returned from the 
countryside. 

Weighty discussions are scarce; this 
is a decompression chamber for fun-
seekers, not dissenters. 

From 10 am to 10 pm every day, 
under the gaze of dour plain lothe 

• police, young people park their 
bicycles in a gray alley and enter the 

narrow dingy room , where plastic 
flowers adorn the tables and Strauss 
waltzes fill the air. 

They order and compulsively 
devour an avalanche of food: hot dogs, 
ice cr am sundaes with chocolate 
sauce , potato salad, pastries, pickles, 
sausage, milkshakes , mooncakes and 
beer, always beer. 

"My parents give me the money for 
this," said on young per on who did 
not want to be identified. Others said 
the 'same. 

On a good day, one worker said, the 
little cafe does about 3 ,000 yuan in 
business - about $1 ,250 , It sells about 
1,000 bottles of beer and 500 of

All over Kurdistan small

Justice into their own hands. 
They shot and wounded a 
conservative member of

long ago. They also have 
vowed to kill as many agas as 
they can.

been assasinated so far?

big landowners who get hurt 
when trouble breaks out," he 
explains. "The agas hire poor 
men to do their fighting for 
them." 

But while officials in 
Ankara play po,litics with the 
situation, it soon becomes 
dear that the Kurds also have 
themselves to blame. 

The .,..obIems . of the four 
million Kurds in Iran, and the 
two million in Iraq, have 
received far more attention. 
But Turkey's six million Kurds 
aa.o find themaelvea unwilling 
guesta at a bitter feast - of 
poverty and violence, foreign 
oppre .. ion and feudal 
exploitation by their own kind. 

'With no strong government, land reform goes 
unenforced, thus maintaining .. the feudal lords' 

The three men killed here 
this morning were not gunned 
down by Turks, but by other 
Kurds. And while a 
revolutionary fervor for soc.ial 
justice explains some of the 
perpetual violence here, blood 
feuds and dan vendettas 
undoubtedly cost many more 
lives each year that bullets 
fired for political ends. 

"You Americans condemn 
Khomeini becauae he stands 
Kurds up against the wall in 
Iran and shools them," 
complains Ali R., a 19·year. 
old Kurdish youth who learned 
his fluent German while he was 
a guest worker in Europe. "But 
of course Turkey is too 
democratic, too Western, too 
progressive, too much your 
precious NATO ally for you to 
notice what goes on here." 

Like almo.t all Kurds one 
meets in Turkey, Ali is eager 
to talk, and afraid to give his 
full name. Hi. bitterness is 
understandable. This town is 
only 375 miles southeast of 
the Turkish carital of Ankara , 
but in terms 0 social justice it 
might be a million miles. The 
contrast between Turkish 
Kurdistan and the rest of 
Turkey is shocking, as . 
ahocking as the gap between 
Park Avenue and Selma, 
Alabama once was. 

For 50 years, Turkey has 
been a nation of ambitious, 
Western· style reforms: mass 
education, universal suffrage, 
separation of church and state, 
equal rights {or women, free 
speech, trade union rights, and 
sweeping land reform that, in 
most 'parts of Turkey, means 
iI\Ose who till the land also own 

television sets and electric 
lights one sees in other rural 
areas of Turkey .. 

The young children, 
illiterate women and 
embittered men one sees 
scratching the rocky soil are 
not Turkish farmers. They are 
Kurdish serfs - landless 
peasants, in constant debt to 
the handful of Kurdish "agas," 
or feudal lords, who own 
almost all the land , and act as 
if the Dark Ages had never 
come to an end. 

Why have the reforms that 
have changed the face of the 
rest of Turkey gone 
unimplemented here? Aside 
from Turkish chauvinism and 
neglect, the explanation goes 
to the very heart of Turkey's 
ultra ·democratic form of 
government. 

Thanks to proportional 
representation, it is 
increasingly difficult for either 
of Turkey's major, main· 
stream political parties to win a 
ruling majority in parliament. 
Both Prime Minister Ecevit 
and his arch·rival, Suleyman 
Demirel, head of the 
opposition Justice Party, have 
found their social programs 
the hostages of small, arch· 
conservative parties, with 

l&tter To The Editor 

land-owners elected .to 
~rliament here in eastern ' 
Turkey prevent either major 
party from forming a strong 
government in Ankara. With 
no strong government , land 
reform goes unenforced, thus 
maintaining the powers of the 
feudal lords." 

Though Ecevit's party is 
somewhat to the left of the 
Democratic Party in the 
United States, it only clings to 
power through a coalition with 
groups that would make right· 
wing Republicans seem 
advocates of radical reform. 
The rightwingers' price for 
supporting Ecevit? Hands off 
the privileges their main 
funders - mostly big 
landowners here in eastern 
Turkey - are anxious to 
retain. 

The result is that the 
democratic system Turkey's 
Western friends so often 
admire activefy supports what 
even Turkish officials here 
concede is a grossly unjust 
social system. 

Ecevit's man in Siverek, 
also a Kurd, is a realist: " I am 
a social democrat. We have a 
social democratic prime 
minister and government.

Why Do Research Paper Ads Stay?

Much to my chagrin, however, I found that 
an advertisement for "Authors' Research

conclusions: either the policy of screening

abandoned or it is the considered judgment of 
the editorial staff of The Dailll Guardian that

Nobel in Economics 

STOCKHOLM - An American and a West 
Indian who teaches in the United States were jointly 
awarded the 1979 Nobel Memorial Prize in 
Economic Science for their work to improve 
economic and "human" conditions , including the 
women's movement, in the Third world. 

The award to the West Indian was the first ever 
given to an economist from the developing world 
according t~ the Royal Swedish Academy. ' 

Theodore W. Schultz, 77, of the University of 
Chicago, and Sir Arthur Lewis, 64, the West Indian 
native and British subject who teaches at Princeton 
University, "both have extensive practical 
experience of development problems and are deeply 
concerned about the need and poverty in the world 
and how to find ways outof under-development," the 
academy said in a ci tation. 

He had been in close contact with Schultz since 
1951 , Lewis said, when the two worked o~ a United 
Nations committee studying developing countries. 

Salvador Crackdown 
SAN SAL V AOOR, EI Salvador - The new 

military government sent troops against opponents in 
one capital suburb yesterday, sUjlpended 
constitutional guarantees and imposed martial law 
and a nighttime curfew in the face of left.wing 
defiance. 

Col. Jaime Abdul Gutierrez and Col. Adolfo 
Arnoldo Mahano also dissolved the legislature that 
was dominated by Gen. Carlos Hurnberto Romero's 
right.wing government, toppled Monday night. 

In Washington, the State Department cautiously 
welcomed the ouster of the rightist regime by the 
generals - described as young moderates - and 
said it was "encouraged" by the new leadership's call 
for moderation and free elections. 

Salvadoran government sources said 
constitutional guarantees were suspended after 
members of the leftist LP ·28 group erected 
barricades and took over Municipal buildings in San 
Salvador 's suburbs of Mejicanos and 
Cuscatancingo. 

No Peanut Crimes 
WASHINGTON - A special counsel, declaring 

that " there is no evidence to establish that Jimmy 
Carter committeed any crimes," said yesterday no 
prosecution is planned in connection with the 
financing of the president's family peanut business. 

Special counsel Paul J . Curran, concluding a six· 
month investigation, said "no indictment can or 
should be brought against anyone" involved in nearly 
$10 million in loans from the National Bank of 
Georgia to the peanut business. 

Curran, in a 239·page report to Attorney General 
Benjamin Civiletti, said there was no evidence any 01 
the money was diverted into Carter's 1976 
presidential campaign. 

However, Curran described a series of financial 
irregularities, involving bookkeeping mistakes and 
inadequate collateral on the part of the Carter peanut 
warehouse, which has been heavily in debt. 

Curran also disclosed that he took an 
unprecedented four ·hour deposition from the 
president at t1ie White House on Sept. 5, the first lime 
a sitting president has ever given swom testimony in 
a criminal investigation. 

New Jupiter Moon 
WASHINGTON - Scientists studying pictures 

snapped by the Voyager 2 spacec'raft have 
discovered a new moon circling the planet Jupiter. 
NASA said it is the fastest moving satellite in the 
solar system. 

The satellite, temporarily designated 1979-J-l, is 
the 14th known to be orbiting giant Jupiter. It is 18 to 
25 miles in diameter and is traveling about 67,000 
mph near the outer edge of the Jovian ring, about 
36,000 mi!es from the planet's cloud tops. 

NASA reported that the discovery was made by 
two researchers at the California Institute of 
Technology, Dr. G. Edward Danielson and graduate 
student David Jewilt. -

1979·J·, is the closest moon to Jupiter. It is 
smaller than seven of the planet's other moons, but 
larger than six of them. The '6atelJite takes only 7

EL CENTRO - Offi ials said yesterday that 

California's worst earthquake in eight years broke the 
major canal bringing water to this arid border region, 
leaving some cities in the area with only a two-day 
water supply. 

At least 91 persons received injuries in the quake, 
almost all of them minor. Damage in the area was put

lQ Tests Ruled Out 
SAN FRANCISCO - IQ tests which lead to the 

placement of an unusually large number 01 black 
youngsters in so-called mentally retarded classes 
were rule unconstitutional by a federal judge 
yesterday. 

Chief US District Judge Robert F. Peckham, ruling 
in a statewide class action suit filed in 1971 on behalf 
of five black youngsters, said the use of standardized 
IQ tests to place children in mentally retarded EMR 
classes violated recently enacted federal laws and 
state and federal Constitutions. 

The judge said evidence showed IQ tests were 
developed on white populations and not adju.ted or 
even re-examined when it became clear certain 
groups - notably blacks and Hispanics - received 
low scores. 

The decision ordered the continuation of a ban on 
IQ testing lor placement of black children into 
educable mentally retarded EMR classes. 

In 20 California school districts which accounted 
for 80 percent of the enrollment of black children in 
1974· 75, blacks accounted for 27.5 percent of the 
student population but 62 percent of the EMR 
enrollment, the judge said.

Stay away from dark, lonely places! Actually, there's a lot more to preventing rape, including 
improving communication between sexes, according to Joan Koerber. coordinator of the Rape 
Prevention Education Program. 

Rape Prevention Program Asks 
How Many Go Unreported Here' 

There has been only one rape reported to 
UCSD police this year, but the Rape Prevention 
Eduction Program is trying to find out how 
many more have gone unreported . 

stigma of being raped . We just make it easier to 
report it and to be taken care of physically and 
emotionally. " 

The Program is holding workshops to help 
prevent more rapes . 

"Women are resistant. They don ' t want to 
talk to the police," says Carole Parker, Crime 
Prevention Police Officer. To fight that trend, 
" totally confidential" report forms will be 
available at residence halls, counseling centers, 
and the UCSD Health Center, according to 
J 0 an K o. e r b e r, Program Co-ordinator, 
"We're interested in all incidents of rape on or 
off campus. It's fully confidential. " 

Presentations aimed at making people aware 
of the "violence associated with the crime of 
rape" are planned as well as workshops in 
human aggression and sexuality assertiveness, 
Koerber says. 

"The long term preventative measures ~ke 
better communication between the sexes and 
Jess aggressiveness can be more effective than 
learning techniques that don't deal with the 
problem at its base," comments K 0 e r b e r . 

Randy Woodard, an advisor to the program, 
added that talking about rape can help the 
victim "cope with the trauma" ... "We (the

Pho~e Company Keeps 
UCSD Students on Hold 
The- Pacific Telephone Company is providing inadequate 

phone serivce to UCSD students living in Del Mar and Solana 
_ Beach, AS Public Relations Direc10r James Montgomery 

charges. 
But the phone company daims that "only eleven people" 

living in Del Mar haven't received full phone service yet, Pacific 
Telephone Public Relations District Manager Andrew Mace 
told The Oailu Guardian yesterday. . 

What problems exist are due to a lack of facilities and 
~n~dentified spokeswoman a t Pacific's Del Mar office says. 
Smce Del Mar and Solana Beach are growing so fast, there is a 

lack of cable facilities . It's really a nebulous thing dependent on 
each person 's address . It's an individual problem," she said. 

Mace was able to clarify this by explaining that most houses 
and apartments are hooked up for one phone line. When several 
students live in an apartment and each one wants a separate 
phone, this causes problems, he said. 

In a letter to the Public Utilities Commission, Montgomery 
stated that he believed the problem to be due to "irresponsible 
policy and procedure" by Pacific Telephone. 

Montgomery also stated that some students may have to wait 
until January 1, 1980 before Ihey can have phone service. 

Neit~~r Mace nor the Del M,:,r spokeswoman were able to give 
speCifiC dates for phone serVice, although the woman did say 
" It 's being taken care of one person at a time." ' 

Mace denies that the current situation has anything to do with 
the Del Mar racetrack, adding, "The racing season is over. MosL 
of the people who had phones installed for that have left by now. 
In any case, the problem is with cables."

Encinas also agreed with the change . "This is something 
we've been working on for years," he remarked , explaining that 
other California schools have already consolidated their 
minority recruitment programs in a similar manner. 

Armitage, who urged the committee last week to vote against 
the change, said last night he was "somewhat" surprised by the 
vote, and would have to review yesterday's meeting before 
coming to a decision on the proposed changes. . 

Saltman called the committee's vote "very significant." 
Because the committee agreed with the task force's 
recommendation, " I applaud what they did," he remarked. 

The two vice cha ncellors will probably meet next Monday to 
discuss the committee's recommendation and will come to a final. 
decision "if we can agree ," Armitage said. Chancellor William 
McElroy will ma ke the decision if the two do not come to an 
agreement , Armitage added. 

There was little opposition to including OASIS, which tutors 
students in several academic areas, in the move, in order to 
encourage both student recruitment a nd retention.

There is some thing about the Indian 
Summer in San Diego that brings out 
the optimist in everyone, Students still 
think they're going to get an "A" in 
every class they take , Faculty and 
staff members just returning from 
summer vacations have forgotten all 
about what its like to have 10,000 
students on campus, And intramural 
sports teams all think they're going 
10-0 and wind up in a championship

Anisotropic Shielders (two-time 
defending champs in Coed

we like our chances against

Budman's note: After two 
false starts in as many 
weeks the Shielders may 
get to playa game this year, 
if they don't scare the 

oppo~i tion away with their 
awesome reputation. 
Budman seems to have 
read something similar last 
week about the mighty 
USC Trojan., 

Ron Neef of Manchester Puck 
Unltd, (defending champ. 
in Coed Hoor Hockey): "I 
hope the rest of the school 
gives us some competition 
this year, La.t year was a 
joke." 
Budman's note: It would be 
nice to report that MPU got

But Sport Waning 

SportsDlanship Found In Field Hockey 
By Jon Goetz 

Watching a field hockey 
game for the first time last 
Wednesday, I expected to 
witness a free -swinging, 
violent contest, like ice 
hockey, 

I suppose I'm just biased 
against hockey, in general, 
Something bothers me about a 
sport that pays burly dock 
worker types to be "enfor-
cers," to grind opposing play-
ers against the plexiglass wall 
as a full-time job. 

But that's not the kind of 
game I saw Wednesday when 
UCSD played its first game of 
the season at Muir Field, The 
UCSD players and their 
opponents from Grossmont 
showed little malice towards 
each other, even in the last 
desperate moments of a 
score1ess tie, When Gross-
mont scored in the final two 
minutes of the game, there was 

sadness on the Triton half of 
the field , a few tears, but no 
trauma, 

Some other features of the 
game aren't seen too often in 
many other sports, For 
instance, the coach behaves 
like a human being during the 
game, Neither coach breathed 
down the referees' necks, 
neither screamed at or insulted 
the players. 

The women showed 
sportsmanship rarely 
displayed in some other sports, 
Part of that is due to the rules, 
which give every woman an 
equal chance at the goal. They 
even gave a cheer after the 
game, thanking the referees. 

The concern for players, the 
healthy competitiveness of the 
game, and the fact that women 
wear skirts for uniforms make 
the game somewhat of an 
anachronism, a reminder of 

~mes when athletics weren't

'Hot Sleep:' Up t9 Date Sci-Fi 
. By Chri. Sherman 

. Thirty years ago, Science 
~rlCtion raised its head out of 
the gutter of pulp fiction and 
became a 'respectable' genre. 

. Fifteen yean ago, staunch 
IUppOrters of the "science" in 
fiction were outraged by a new 
lP'0up of writers who were 
called (imaginatively enough) 
the "new wave." And now, 
with the recent production of 
Star Wars and Alien, "sf" has 
developed an "SO's sensibil· 
ity" and is well on the road 
towards being the most 
lignifieant genre of the coming 
decade. 

T e1eviaion and music have 
been the spearheads for this 
new lensibility. An emphasis 

has been placed on a rapid 
flow of information, a flashy 
presentation, speeding up our 
perception of art to be more in 
synch with our electronic 
counterpart, the computer. 
Music is more abrupt, no 
longer muddled with 
symphonic mimicry. Even 
station· identification spots on 
television now have psuedo-
later design intended 10 dazz.le 
the numb viewer. flash if the 
key to popular success these 
days, and literature is finally 
coming around to this 

rea~zation. Orson Scott Card 
is one of the more interesting 
acience fiction writers fusing 
the old fashioned adventure 
story with this modern 
sensibility. 

HoI Sleep is perhaps a more 

interesting glimpse at a future 
society where technocracy has 
gone out of control that was 
Star Wars. It is a society 
sharply divided by class, and 
the more money/status you 
have, the longer you live 
thanks to somee, the drug of 
immortality. Being in high. 
50Ciety means only waking 
once evry 20 years or so to 
indulge in cosmic decadence . 

Like every other Rome 
throughout history, this 
!ociety is doomed to fall . 
Fortunately, th rough the 
foresight of a certain powerful 
and concerned politician, 
several hundred of the most 
intelligent, survival·oriented 
people are selected for 
developing a new civilization.

most violent , there is 
unquestionably no one more 
admired than the team of Stan 
Laurel and Oliver Har.dy. 

Their child·like character , 
the consistent mood of all their 
films , that silly background 
music, and the marvelous 
troupe of supporting players 
they appeared with were all 
reasons why people all over 
the world fondly remember the 
antics of Stan and Ollie. But 
there is one organization 
which does more than merely 
remember the boys . This 
group, The Sons of The Desert 
(named after a 1933 Laurel

everything they can to keep

Laurel. The group consisted of 
Stan and Ollie buffs ga thering 
to pay homage to and screen 
these comic films. There were 
toasts, not only to Laurel and 
Hardy, but to such regulars as 
Jimmy Finlayson, Mae Busch 
a nd Charlie Hall. Stan 
suggested that all business be 
conducted with "a half-assed 
dignity", and these words set 
the mood for the club. Soon 
after Laurel died in 1965, The 
Sons of The Desert began 
meeting in New York City. At 
first, the numbers were small, 
but soon branches of the club, 
known as tents, began 
popping up all over the 
country. 

There was the Way Out 
West Tent of Los Angeles, the 
Bacon Grabbers in Chicago, 
the Big Business Tent of 
Cleveland, and even a tent in a 
Connecticut correctional 
institution called the Pardon 
Us Tent. All of the tents are 
named after the various films 
of Laurel and Hardy. To date, 
there are over 60 tents 
worldwide, some of which are 
10 England, Denmark,

James Thurber

The life and alt of James 
Thurber will be presented' in a

William Windom at 8 pm 
Friday, October 19, in the 
Mandeville Auditorium at the 
University of California, San

Admillion to the perfor· 
mance is $5.50 for the general 
public and $3.50 for students. 

When Thurber joined the 
staff of a popular new 
magazine called The New 
Yorker in 1927, he was an up-
and-coming young writer from 
Ohio. Ironically, he was hired 
as a full·time editor, but when 
Thurber began deliberately 
making mistakes while editing 
articles, his boll realized that 
Thurber was determined to 
write, even if it meant resorting 
to sabotage. 

As soon as the adjustment 
was made, Thurber began 
producing articles and 
drawings which eventually 
filled dozens of books. His 
pieces have been translated 
into 21 languages. And, 
though his charaders were 
said to resemble "unbaked 
cookies" by Thurber's friend

he did not pursue the matter, 
Silverira says. 

During the 1920's, Allen 
began collecting a "working 
library for a scholar," says 
UCSD literature professor 
Roy Harvey Pearce, who 
along with literature 
professor Thomas Dunseath 

are former students of Allen's. 
It was through their efforts that 
UCSD obtained the collection, 
they say. 

Pearce says Allen collected 
the books not for their rarity of 
beauty but for educational and 
research purposes. The 
collection includes Renais-
sance interpretations of the

Classics , such as Aristotle, 
Plato and Caesar. 

The collection also contains 
many encyclopedias of that 
period. Pearce explains that 
the " Renaissance Man" was 
associated with general 
knowledge because of his 
encyclopedia. 

Peyton calls the books "a 
cohesive collection of the 
period. " While many books 
are written in English, most are 
written in Latin or Greek. 

Peyton also says that 
although students have easy 
access to the collection, it is 
"definitely underused." Most 
of the books can be seen 
during regular library hours. 
Some books are kept in a safe 
or in a locked room, and are 
available through a staff 
member on the fourth floor .

and to the plight of the 
common man that was 
distinctly Thurber's . 

William Windom won an 
Emmy for playing Thurber in 
the 1969 -70 television series , 
My World and W e lcome To 
II. As a long-time fan of 
Thurber's , Windom's interest 
in the man was sparked when 
he did the series. 

To prepare for the one-ma n 
show, Windom has read about 
90 percent of Thurber's 
published works and he has 
corresponded with Thurber's 
widow, Helen. 

Thurber is sponsored by the 
University Events Office . 
Tickets can be purchased at 
the UCSD Central Box Office ,

Pirates Win 4-0, Tie Up Series 
Continued from paRe 7 
of-seven Series. 

Since scoring six runs in the eighth inning of Game Four, 
the Orioles have fallen into a dreadful slump, managing just 
one run in 19 innings. Their slumbering bats proved fatal to 
.tarter Jim Palmer, who pitched a creditable game, matching 
Candelaria's shutout through the first six innings. 

Candelaria, who has been troubled by back and rib cage 
injuries, was lifted for pinch-hitter Lee Lacy leading off the 
seventh a. the Pirates sought to get something going against 
Palmer. But Lacy .truck out as a capacity Memorial Stadium 
crowd of 53,739 roared its approval. Soon, however, the 
Pirates silenced the crowd. 

Speedy Omar Moreno, criticized for his poor hitting in 
earlier game., drilled the second of hi. three singles of the 
night to right~ field. Then, on a hit-and-run pIa)" Tun Foli 
bounced a ~I up the middle. Orioles shortstop Kiko Garcia 
tried to field the ball and keep his foot on the base for the force 
play on Moreno. But he succeeded in neither, and the ball 
IQuirted through for a single. 

That set the Pirates' table with big guns Parker and Stargell 
coming up. In the fint inning, Palmer had escaped a similar 
jam against the same two hitters. This time, however, he 
didn't get away. 

Parker, who carried a .429 Series batting average into this 
game, drilled a .ngle past second baseman Rich Dauer, 
scoring Moreno with the game's first run and sending Foli 
scampering to third_ A moment later, Stargell got the second 
run home with a sacrifice fly to left field. 

Finally in front, Pittsburgh went to the ace of its bullpen, the 
lanky , bespectacled T ekulve. He had been ripped in Game 
Four - the victim of the bulk of that big Baltimore six-run rally. 
This time, it was a different story as he mowed the Orioles 
down easily, allowing one hit .the final three innings. 

The Pirates doubled their lead in the eighth. Ed Ott opened 
with a single and dashed to third on Phil Garner's ground rule

double that bounced into the lett field stands. It. was the 
second hit of the game and 11th of the Series for Garner, who 
also set a world Series record in Tuesday's game by 
participating in his ninth double-play. 

Bill Robinson, who had come into the game in a defensive 
shift in the seventh, followed with another sacrifice fly to left, 
and then Moreno, who had left 11 men on base in the first two 
games of the Series, delivered an RBI single, making it 4 -0. 

The Pirates came out swinging against Palmer from the 
start. Moreno bounced a single up the middle on the game's 
first pitch, and Foli doubled off the glove of third baseman 
Doug DeCinces on the next one. 

Parker hit Palmer's third pitch down the third base line, 
with DeCinces making a sharp backhand stop to throw the 
batter out as the runners held. Then, Stargell also went after 
the first pitch, popping oul. John Milner was the first Pirate 
hitter to take a pitch and finally bounced out, ending the 
threat. 

Ott hit what looked like a double play ball, but Madlock's 
rolling block slide at second upset Garcia and allowed the 
runner to reach first. Willi men on first and third and two out, 
Pittsburgh's hottest hitter , Garner, came to the plate. With 
Candelaria on deck, Palmer solved his problem by plunding 
Garner with a pitch, loading the bases. Then he struck out 
Candelaria on three pitches. 

Candelaria and Palmer dueled on even terms into the 
seventh, and then the Pirates bats woke up and produced the 
first of the runs Pittsburgh needed. 

The issue will be settled in a seventh game - the 27th time in 
the 76-year history of the World Series the Series has been 
decided in the limit. 

Since 1922, when the best-of-seven format was adopted 
permanently, only three teams have wiped out 3-1 deficits to 
win the Series. The last was Detroit in 1968 against St. Louis. 
The New York Yankees did it against Milwaukee in 1958, 
and Pittsburgh did it against Washington in 1925.
