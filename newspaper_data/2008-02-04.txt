UCSD’s University Art Gallery 
opened again to the public last 
month with a recently renovated 
space, new curatorial directorship 
and fresh exhibition titled “In the 
Beginning.”

While UAG reopened on Jan. 19, 
the space has been a part of UCSD 
since 1978. It closed in 2006 for 
remodeling.

The gallery’s transfigurations 
include renovated walls, a new 
floor and reception desk, different 
staff and what new curator Stephen 
Hepworth calls “a more open and 
flexible feel.”

“In the first few days it was great 
to see people spotting it on Ridge 
Walk,” Hepworth said. “From this 
enthusiasm we can start to build on 
previously existing audiences and 
find new ones.”

Hepworth is a London-based art-
ist with experience managing other 
noted galleries such as the non-
profit Tannery, the Jerwood Gallery 
— which assists young artists in the 
development of their careers — and 
Bloomberg SPACE in London. He

An A.S. Council-chartered task 
force is currently researching one of 
UCSD’s oldest and most contested 
student life issues: the possibility of 
creating a UCSD football team.

All-Campus Senator Utsav Gupta 
said he established the Intercollegiate 
Football Feasibility Task Force to 
explore the longstanding debate 
among UCSD students. Gupta said 
the purpose of the task force is not to 
argue for or against a football team, 
but rather to research the potential 
costs and benefits of having one.

“I want to take all these argu-
ments, pro and con, and form one 
prime document that can be used for 
either side,” Gupta said.  

The task force will research issues 

New Winter Format, 
Same Winter Turnout

By Yelena Akopian
Contributing Writer

Thumping techno beats and sweaty students brought the 
Price Center Ballroom to life at the first-ever Winter All-
Campus Dance, the A.S. Programming event that replaced 
the WinterFest concert of previous years on Jan. 31. However, 
despite the change in size and venue, it drew less of an audi-
ence than last year’s WinterFest, making it the lowest-attended 
Winter Quarter programming event in the last four years.

Rx Bandits opened the event to a modest but excited 
crowd. Playing reggae, funk and ska-infused rock, the mostly 
bearded quintet switched from jazzy breakdowns and soulful 
instrumentals to mosh pit-inspiring choruses. 

Though the band played to a crowd that filled less than a 
quarter of the ballroom floor, by the time the Bandits left the 
stage, they had the crowd chanting for an encore. 

The Bandits’ act was a surprise to those who were expect-
ing original act Ima Robot, who canceled their appearance 
due to illness.

“Rx Bandits have played quite a few very successful shows 
at UCSD before,” A.S. Programming Festivals Coordinator 
Garrett Berg said. “We felt they were a solid choice for the 
last-minute change.”

At around 8:50 p.m., Lazaro Casanova took the stage. 
The act, comprised of a young DJ, his turntable and a slew 
of catchy electronica, prompted concertgoers to dance with 
wild abandon.

L.A. Riots followed Casanova at 10:15 p.m., a duo that 
has gained growing attention from electronica lovers and 
clubgoers over the past year. The crowd dwindled as the 
show progressed, but those remaining continued to dance 
until midnight. 

The latter two bands of this year’s lineup brought a new 
genre of music not usually seen at UCSD.

“Rather than simply repeat the fall dance, we decided to 
diversify the lineup,” Berg said.

Some attendees were surprised by the relatively low turn-
out, which peaked at about 800 people, 60 that paid to attend 
the concert. Last year’s WinterFest attracted 1,200 people.

“There weren’t as many people as we expected,” said East 
Lake High School student Samantha Villegas, one of several 
local high school students who purchased tickets to see the 
last two electronica acts. “But it was still so much fun. I wish 
we could have kept dancing.”

Some East Lake students complained that many of their 
friends tried to purchase tickets for the performance at the 
door but were turned away despite the low attendance and 

mostly empty Ballroom floor. 
“In general, students should always plan to buy tickets to 

our events in advance,” Berg said. “Student guest tickets were 
on sale right up until the night of the event.”

Despite the turnout, Berg said the programmers were 
generally satisfied with the new format.

“The event was essentially a test run, and while we would 
have liked to see a larger turnout, we feel the event went well 
overall,” he said.

The size and scope of Winterfest has been consistently 
reduced in recent years to free up funding for more popular 
events such as Bear Gardens. Last year the event was moved 
from RIMAC Arena to the less-expensive ballroom and 
remained there this year due to low funding and the predict-
ably small attendance. 

Also different this year was the decision to host the event 
on a Thursday night instead of the traditional Friday.

“We have yet to decide whether Winter All-Campus 
Dance will continue in years to come,” Berg said. “Regardless, 
it’s unlikely that we will return to the traditional WinterFest 
format.”

Pell Grant Now More

CAMPUS ART 
GALLERY GETS 

NEW ‘BEGINNING’

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

The U.S. Department of Education 
recently released guidelines regarding 
this year’s awards for the federal Pell 
Grant program, opting to raise the 
maximum possible award while simul-
taneously lowering the number of stu-
dents qualifying for aid.

The increase in the funding of one 
of the nation’s  largest need-based grant 
program stems from the College Cost 
Reduction and Access Act, signed into 
law by President George W. Bush in 
September. The CCRAA allotts an 
additional $490 per eligible student for 
the 2008-09 Pell Grant award year. 

The CCRAA funds, coupled with a 
$69 decrease in discretionary funding, 
nets an overall increase of $421 for 
eligible students — making the maxi-
mum award $4,731 next year.

While the changes increase the 
maximum amount of money for each 
student who receives a Pell Grant, they 
do not make the grant more acces-
sible, said Mark Kantrowitz, founder of 
financial aid Web site www.FinAid.org. 

“Even though the maximum Pell 
Grant has increased, the $69 decrease 
in discretionary funding will slightly 

reduce the number of students who 
otherwise would be eligible for a Pell 
Grant,” Kantrowitz said.

The maximum award could be 
raised in the future, as Bush plans to 
request a $2.6-billion increase to the 
Pell Grant program from Congress 
later this week. An increase of this 
magnitude would bring the maxi-
mum total award between $5,100 and 
$5,400.

The current White House admin-
istration is asking for almost $60 
billion overall for education this year. 
However, this amount, nearly equal 
to the money allotted for the past 
year, has not been adjusted for infla-
tion.

While the overall amount of money 
that Pell Grant recipients will take home 
this year has gone up, the maximum

Savings Plan Group Joins 
College Preparation Project

ScholarShare, California’s 529 
College Savings Plan, and its pro-
gram manager Fidelity Investments 
have joined forces with the Early 
Academic Outreach Program to 
help fund the Family Inclusion 
Initiative. The initiative consists of 
a series of workshops and activi-
ties designed to empower parents 
to advise students about college 
preparation.

The pilot program provides cul-
turally relevant, multilingual work-
shops and activities throughout the 
academic year that educate parents 
about key information about col-
lege eligibility, financial aid and the 
admissions process. EAOP’s Family 
Inclusion Initiative is also a partner-
ship between schools, districts and 
community groups to assist families 
in boosting scholastic achievement.  

“California’s economy is becom-
ing increasingly more competitive 
and good jobs increasingly require a 
higher education,” said Bill Lockyer, 
California state treasurer and chair 
of ScholarShare, in a press release. 
“That makes college all the more 
important and the Early Academic 
Outreach Program provides 
California’s youth with a tremen-
dous college planning resource. I’m 
proud to work with my alma mater, 
the University of California, to help 
deliver this vital program to deserv-
ing students throughout the state.”

Parent involvement in children’s 
education is positively related to 
achievement, and the initiative’s 
events give parents who have little 
experience dealing with college 
the information they need to guide 

their children along a college path. 
EAOP, ScholarShare and Fidelity 
Investments have said that the ini-
tiative is a vital strategy for support-
ing parents in their efforts to close 
achievement gaps in California.

UCSD Students Tailgate 
L.A. Presidential Debate

Students from eight southern 
California universities built a life-
size plywood truck and tailgated 
the presidential candidate debates 
outside Hollywood’s Kodak Theatre 
last week to bring attention to 
issues important to young voters.  

UCSD students who joined 
the effort are volunteers with the 
California Student Public Interest 
Research Group’s New Voters 
Project, which has registered thou-
sands of young voters this primary 
season and is now running “get out 
the vote” drives on college cam-
puses statewide. UCSD’s CALPIRG 
members have registered nearly 
500 voters. 

Since April, more than 400 
student volunteers with the proj-
ect have appeared at fundraisers, 
photo-ops and town hall meet-
ings to urge presidential candidates 
to speak directly to young people 
about issues relevant to them. The 
eight universities who aided the 
project include UCLA, USC, L.A. 
City College, L.A. Valley College, 
UC Santa Barbara, UCSD, UC 
Riverside and UC Irvine.

CALPIRG is a statewide student 
organization that works to solve 
public interest problems related to 
the environment, consumer protec-
tion and government reform.

A news article published on Jan. 28 titled “Artists Duel With Admins in 
Mandeville Center Graffiti War” incorrectly stated that the University 
Art Gallery was responsible for painting over the graffiti in Mandeville 
Center stairwells. In fact, the gallery was only responsible for painting 
over graffiti directly adjacent to its entrances.

was recruited by Amy Adler, a mem-
ber of UCSD’s visual arts depart-
ment. 

“What was interesting to me 
was that there was the desire and 
commitment to relaunch the space 
with an emphasis on current con-
temporary art within the supported 
environment of UCSD,” Hepworth 
said. “The gallery should speak to 
not only those who are involved in 
the university, but to a larger public 
beyond its campus.” 

“In the Beginning,” UAG’s cur-
rent exhibition, features work by 20 
artists from Europe and America 
who used contemporary approaches 
to create pieces that involve words 
in a variety of compositions. 

The collection is composed of 
different forms of media — includ-
ing paintings, sculptures and video 
— all centering on words in rela-
tion to their form and meaning. 

Expected Family Contribution — the 
amount of money a student’s family 
can contribute to his or her education 
— has been reduced from $4,110 to 
$4,041. Therefore, students with an 
EFC from $4,042 to $4,110 who were 
able to benefit from funds last year 
will no longer be eligible for federal aid 
under the Pell Grant program. 

Kantrowitz said the bottom line is 
that while slightly fewer students will 
qualify for the Pell Grant, the remain-
ing Pell Grant-eligible students will get 
$421 more each.

“That’s a fairly substantial increase, 
although it does not make up for four 
years of no increases,” he said. 

In addition to the monetary 
boost, the payment and disburse-
ment schedules for Pell Grant funds 
have also changed. While alternate

Alternate Schedule Will Not Affect UCSD Students
▶ GRANTS, from page 3 payment and disbursement schedules 

were previously used in addition to 
the main schedule, the repeal of the 
Tuition Sensitivity Rule now bases all 
awards on a single payment schedule 
for all students. 

The TSR, originally part of the 
Higher Education Act, reduced Pell 
Grant funds for students who chose 
to attend colleges with lower tuitions. 
The HEA is currently in its eighth 
extension, and its reauthorization will 
be put to yet another vote before this 
extension expires on April 30. Rep. 
George Miller (D-Calif.), who serves 
as chairman of the Committee on 
Education and Labor, indicated in a 
press release that if it is reauthorized, 
the repeal of the TSR is expected to 
become permanent. 

If the reauthorization passes, stu-
dents attending low-cost community 

colleges will be the most affected 
group, as the bill would raise their 
funding to be equal with their peers 
attending more expensive institu-
tions. UCSD will not be one of the 
institutions affected by this reversal 
from an alternate payment sched-
ule as undergraduates qualify for the 
maximum Pell Grant already. 

“The alternate schedule is not 
applicable at UCSD because our 
cost of attendance is not less than 
$805,” said Ann Klein, senior associ-
ate director at UCSD’s Financial Aid 
Office. 

UCSD expects to have close to 
7,200 Pell Grant recipients this year, 
totaling nearly $24 million in Pell 
Grant funds, Klein said.

Current Collection Emphasizes Meaning of  Media
▶ GALLERY, from page 1 The exhibition runs through 

Mar. 9 and will also include a 
series of scheduled talks and events 
that opens panel discussions to 
the public and allows attendees to 
interact with some of the exhibit’s 
artists.

“Many of the staff from both San 
Diego’s Museum of Contemporary 
Art and Museum of Art attended 
the opening and were impressed 
with the first show,” Hepworth said. 

UAG, in partnership with 
UCSD’s visual arts department, will 
now be open year-round for a total 
exhibition of five shows. Visual arts 
Chair Lesley Stern will serve as 
director. 

In addition, the campus’ MFA 
students will be able to showcase 
their work at an annual exhibition.  

“We’re very excited — once again 
the gallery will become a lively part 
of the university and of the larger 
San Diego-Tijuana-L.A. region,” 

Stern said in a press release. “In 
time we hope to extend to an inter-
national presence.”

Hepworth said he is optimistic 
about the gallery’s future, citing gal-
leries at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and California College 
of the Arts as successful models to 
which UCSD aspires.

“The University Art Gallery is 
joining part of a larger community 
of spaces, all of who have their own 
voices,” Hepworth said. “What is 
important is that we are mutually 
supportive and seek collectivity to 
grow both audiences, and the profile 
of San Diego as an important city 
for contemporary art.”   

The University Art Gallery is 
open from Tuesday to Saturday 
between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the 
west end of Mandeville Center.

including financial costs, the potential 
team’s impact on the UCSD academic 
scene, opinions of the administration 
and student body and how a team’s 
presence would affect Title IX, which 
mandates that schools provide equal 
athletic opportunities to men and 
women. The task force will also look 
at the progress of universities that 
have recently founded football teams, 
such as UC Davis, and examine more 
established football teams at other 
universities.

Gupta said one of the biggest 
issues the task force will explore is 
how a football team would be finan-
cially supported, with possible funds 
coming from alumni contributions 
or the university. Other key issues 
under consideration by the task force 
include where a future team would 
practice and what stadium it would 
use for games.

The task force, whose research 
is still in the early stages, hopes to 
release its findings by fifth week of 
Spring Quarter.  

UCSD had a football team for one 
winless season in 1968, but it was 
discontinued because of the Vietnam 
War draft. 

Since then, Gupta said, there have 
been three referendums to reintro-
duce football to UCSD, all of which 
failed. The task force will also exam-
ine why these referendums were not 
successful.  

“I just see this as a way of opening 
up the debate,” Gupta said. “It’s the 
first little baby step to see if UCSD 
wants to have a football team.” 

If the task force discovers substan-
tial evidence that a football team is 
not feasible, then the issue will likely 
become less controversial, Gupta said.

Meanwhile, student opinion is 
varied on whether a football team 
would benefit UCSD. Two opposing 
Facebook groups, for example, reflect 
this opposition.

The Facebook group supporting 

a football team is connected to the 
Web site www.gotritons.com, which 
estimates the cost of a possible foot-
ball team at $1 million. Proponents 
argue that a student fee increase of 
approximately $20 per undergraduate 
could raise the funds needed, which 
would include the funds necessary 
for the creation of additional women’s 
teams needed to comply with Title IX. 
Regarding facilities, the site suggests 
that RIMAC fields could be expanded 
or the team could practice at a com-
munity college or high school. But 
members also said that scheduling 
could be a hurdle due to the lack of 

Division-II football teams.  
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said 

at the Nov. 1 A.S. Council meeting 
that she expected the team to cost 
more than the $1-million prediction, 
citing the $100-million Division-I pro-
grams at schools such as Ohio State 
University as an upper limit.

“If you’re interested, keep the cards 
and letters coming, but for now we 
don’t have the money,” Fox said at the 
meeting.

Earl Warren College senior Matt 
King, who operates the Facebook 
group protesting the creation of a foot-
ball team, said that a team would do far 
more harm than good, mainly because 
of the funding it would require.

King said that UCSD cannot fund 
full-time scholarships for football play-
ers, and that because of UCSD’s loca-

tion in Southern California, it would 
be difficult to beat powerhouses like 
UCLA and USC in recruiting players.  

“It would be impossible to have a 
Division-I school,” King said.

He also said that when people 
imagine a football team at UCSD, 
they are probably comparing it to 
the ones at well-known Division-I 
schools, when in reality Division-II 
football teams are relatively unknown. 
He also said that it would be difficult 
for UCSD to be competitive because 
the squad would initially consist of 
volunteer athletes, while the better 
athletes would go to schools that pro-
vide scholarships and have a long-
standing football culture.

“We wouldn’t be playing in bowl 
games,” he said.  

The crowds at existing sports, such 
as basketball and water polo, are rela-
tively small, King said, and because of 
Title IX it is likely that some existing 
men’s teams would have to be cut in 
order to match the number of women’s 
teams.  

Despite the cost, Fox said she is 
still open to the possibility of a football 
team at UCSD, but stressed the dif-
ficulties inherent in any attempts to 
implement one.

“Chancellor Fox has always felt 
strongly that athletics and recreational 
opportunities are essential to a well-
balanced collegiate experience,” uni-
versity spokeswoman Dolores Davies 
said in an e-mail. 

She said that while UCSD does not 
have a football team, it boasts an award-
winning intercollegiate athletics pro-
gram that also deserves recognition.

“A football team in UCSD’s future is 
always a possibility, but it would require 
substantial support from students as 
well as faculty, and would require a 
substantial investment of funds both 
by the campus and in terms of student 
fees,” she said.

T his fervent endorsement of Illinois Sen. Barack Obama is predicated on the notion that American politics aches for 
change — and it’s more than a buzzword by now, 
it’s a necessity.

The nation’s most needy are, and have been 
for eight long years, downtrodden. They are 
beaten down eco-
nomically, education-
ally and racially by 
a string of injustices 
ranging from the wars 
in the Middle East to 
President George W. 
Bush’s Patriot Act to 
Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s 
mishandling of 
Hurricane Katrina 
relief efforts. The pub-
lic has come to mis-
trust politicians as the harbingers of division, 
using governmental agencies to talk tall and act 
little. It is a dark time to be part of the citizenry.

So it was with refreshing verve that many 
voters were introduced to Obama at the 2004 
Democratic National Convention, where the sen-
ator delivered a keynote address harkening the 
tenets of unity America had not seen since Sen. 
Robert F. Kennedy made his run at the presiden-
cy in 1968. Obama spoke of the links between red 
and blue, conservative and liberal, and seemed 
neither Republican nor Democrat: He was just a 
man who wanted a better America.

That is Obama’s strongest personality hook: 

He is relatable to his constituents. His desire to 
see this country bettered is in line with the bulk 
of Americans. Better health care, better job secu-
rity, better education and an end to war. Obama 
is the closest mirror to the warmly personable 
Bobby in this election race.

Bobby united a spectrum of voters under 
his flag: old to young, 
black to white to brown 
voters threw their sup-
port behind the char-
ismatic and vibrant 
figure who touted his 
simplistically idealistic 
approach to political 
change. “I do not run 
for the presidency to 
oppose any man but to 
propose new policy,” 
Kennedy said when he 
announced his presi-

dential candidacy. “I run because I am convinced 
that this country is on a perilous course and I 
have such strong feelings about what must be 
done. And I feel that I am obliged to do all that 
I can.”

The question now is, are times different? 
Has the bureaucratic process grown too convo-
luted, too hefty for a “man of change” to actu-
ally instigate change? New York Sen. Hillary 
Clinton’s argument against Obama is decidedly 
strong. A woman of her experience and lengthy 
resume would be better equipped to enter the 

S imply put, John McCain is the best Republican candidate for president.The Arizona senator has both the 
leadership skills and character necessary to lead 
the United States in a new direction at a time 
when most of the world continues to regard 
our country with hostility, especially amid the 
increasingly unpopu-
lar Iraq War.

Unlike his oppo-
nents, the 71-year-old 
Vietnam War veteran 
and former prisoner 
of war consistently 
defends his beliefs 
without regard for 
political peril, a char-
acteristic most strong-
ly demonstrated by 
how many times he 
rejects the motions of 
his own party and president.

He breaks with the GOP on illegal immigra-
tion, an issue that hits close to home for this 
border-state politician, sensibly advocating a 
pathway for citizenship for the country’s esti-
mated 12 million illegal aliens while simulta-
neously calling for tougher immigration stan-
dards.

Again separating himself from others in 
his own party, McCain also staunchly supports 
rebuilding America’s image abroad by closing 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — the military deten-
tion center that houses suspected terrorists 
— beginning legal proceedings for detainees 

and banning torture, which he himself has 
survived. 

With many Republicans refusing to 
acknowledge global warming as a dire problem, 
McCain has been a leading voice for climate 
policy reform, championing the first Senate 
bill to address the problem legislatively in 

2003. Although that 
bill ultimately failed, 
McCain continues 
to defy many fellow 
Republicans by sup-
porting cap-and-trade 
policies to reduce 
greenhouse-gas emis-
sions.

He also supports 
more federal funding 
for embryonic stem 
cell research — one 
of the only lead-

ing Republicans to do so — and is realistic 
about the ominous future of Social Security and 
Medicare, saying that if elected he would place 
overhauling those programs at the top of his 
domestic agenda.

But McCain does have his flaws. He is 
against abortion and the legalization of same-
sex marriage, and has consistently said that he 
would keep troops in Iraq for as long as neces-
sary — whatever that means.

Those issues aside, McCain is clearly the 
best choice from a field of candidates that also

Proposition 91No on
P roposition 91 exemplifies wasteful bureaucracy. It is the tail end of a legislative saga that began with former Gov. Gray Davis’ administration.

Motorists at the pump pay 7.5 percent in federal 
and state taxes tagged specifically for transportation 
funds. Those monies previously went to the state’s 
general fund, but voters passed Proposition 42 in 2002 
to specifically beef up what they considered to be the 
state’s faltering transit infrastructure. A caveat dictated 
that the measure be suspended, and money reallocated 
to the general fund for more flexible use in the event 
of a fiscal emergency. Then, in 2006, voters again put 
their foot down for transportation improvements by 
approving Proposition 1A, which mandates that any 
monies borrowed from the state’s transportation fund 
be repaid with interest within three years. It was a gain-
ful addition to the state’s tax-on-gas laws, allowing the 
state the chance to fix its broken freeways and transpor-

tation systems within a short time period if politicians 
overborrowed.

So now comes Proposition 91, which seeks to choke 
out any flexibilities drawn from related legislation. 
The measure was initiated by industry groups fight-

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

S ince last month, opponents of Proposition 93 have been hauling a life-sized Trojan horse around California as a statement on the item’s 
outwardly benevolent but inherently deceptive nature. 
While this political ploy revels in its own melodrama, 
a close examination of the issue illustrates the appro-
priateness of this metaphor: Presented as a poorly 
disguised gift to cap term limits and encourage politi-
cians to reject the influence of lobbyists, the proposi-
tion is a last-ditch effort for current state leaders to 
hold on to the power they may soon lose. 

If approved, Proposition 93 will allow members 
of the California State Legislature to remain in office 
for 12 consecutive years, two years less than the 14 
total authorized by 1990’s Proposition 140. Currently, 
members may serve six years in the Assembly and 
eight years in the Senate. Some analysts have argued 
this does not give them adequate time to forge 
substantive changes before depending on lobbyist 

funds for re-election. Proposition 93 would allow 
legislators to serve the 12 years in one house, which 
proponents claim would allow them more indepen-
dence from outside influence.

The catch? Current senators could stay in office 
four years longer than current term-limit laws dictate, 
and acting members of the assembly would pocket an 
extra six. Not surprisingly, two of Proposition 93’s 
most vocal backers — Assembly Speaker Fabian 
Núñez (D-Los Angeles) and Senate President Pro 
Tempore Don Perata (D-Oakland) — will have to 
leave office in the event that the item fails.

A little more subtlety would have helped, gentle-
men.

It would be hasty, however, to reject the item 
merely because its key proponents have a vested 
interest in its outcome — such is the nature of poli-
tics. However, in looking at California’s voter track 
record, the people have spoken out against any politi-
cal tinkering with Proposition 140, clearly emphasiz-
ing the importance of openness and transparency in 
their officials’ term-related actions.

For example, when former Senate President Pro 
Tempore John Burton (D-San Francisco) tried to 
mitigate Proposition 140 in 2002 by spearheading 
Proposition 45 — which would have amended the 
state constitution to soften the imposed term limits 
— 58 percent of voters were quick to shoot it down. It 

P roposition 92 seeks to grab K-14 education — particularly the community college system — a big chunk of change in preparation for 
the tight-budgeted future. The problem is, while 
funding education should be a top state priority, the 
numbers just aren’t adding up and California’s most 
important programs are all feeling the sting of budget 
cuts. This instance of special interest-driven ballot 
box budgeting helps only a subset of students, and 
would place an extra burden on the California State 
University and University of California systems as 
they deal with an extra $70 million of lost revenue in 
the already tight fiscal future.

Supporters of Proposition 92 argue that by lower-

ing costs for community colleges, the measure pro-
vides a valuable educational gateway to the middle 
class. But this ignores a glaring financial problem: 
By decreasing fee revenue without raising taxes or 
offering any other method to balance the loss, the 
proposal would create a massive funding deficit in 
a sector already being severely slashed. Unless all 
of the state’s students stand together to bear cuts 
equally, community colleges — which already charge 
the country’s lowest tuition costs — stand to see an 
unnecessary gain by crippling their higher education 
sister institutions. 

Though supporters have a point — community 
colleges give struggling high school graduates a path-
way to four-year universities and provide many adults 
with important career instruction — this proposition 
is financially unrealistic and blatantly irresponsible, 
and would build upon a dangerous precedent of 
education earmarking. It’s a fair assessment that K-14 
schools need more support, but shorting the UC and 
CSU systems for community colleges is not the way 
to solve the state’s education woes.

By locking up approximately $300 million annu-
ally for K-14 education while simultaneously throw-

U nlike winning a slot machine jackpot, Propositions 94, 95, 96 and 97 are no gamble, and will bring much-needed rev-
enue to California at a time when it seems the state 
is slipping further and further into financial crisis.

If passed, the measures would simply uphold 
gaming agreements that are already in existence; 
the four American Indian tribes covered by the 
measures already support large casinos on their 
reservations.

In fact, the proposed changes to the gaming 
compacts were championed by the state, approved 
by bipartisan majorities in the Legislature and 
signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, but because 
of a strong push — primarily by racetrack owners 
and a few other tribes — a petition drive landed 
the propositions on the ballot, forcing California 
voters to decide their fate.

The initiatives are virtually identical, with the 
only difference being the Riverside and San Diego 
County tribes in question: the Pechanga Band of 
Luiseño Mission Indians, the Morongo Band of 
Mission Indians, the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay 
Nation, and the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla 

Indians.
The agreements between the state and the 

tribes, which hold exclusive rights to operate slot 
machines in California, would increase the per-
mitted number of operating machines by a few 
thousand. 

More machines mean more gamblers, which 
ultimately means more money. According to a 
formula drawn up in the agreements, the tribes 
will give the state 15 to 25 percent of the total 
additional revenue, which the state has predicted 
to number in the hundreds of millions per year.

There is really no logical argument against 
these propositions; opponents argue that the res-
ervations will transform into huge Las Vegas-esque 
powerhouses and that expansion projects will irre-
versibly harm the environment, but in reality the 
expansions will conform to strict standards in line 
with established state law.

The expansions will not adversely affect the 
state’s 104 other indigenous tribes, another claim 
thrown around by opponents; under the agree-
ments, the four tribes would share tens of millions 
of dollars with other tribes that currently have little 
or no gaming.

Critics also preach that tribes will have the ulti-
mate say regarding how much money will be given 
to California, but in actuality the State Gaming 
Agency will audit each payment, and disputes will 
be settled accordingly. Although those audits will 
not be available to the public — every rose has its 
thorn — there is no arguing against the fact that 
the state will receive more revenue.

It is true that the measures will not solve the

foolish to think that the state would 
not benefit enormously from them 
— both via revenue and the creation

is clear that Californians support the 
law they fought for on multiple occa-
sions, but perhaps the state’s elected 
officials know better than the unedu-
cated masses.

While Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger claims that vot-
ers have previously gone “too far” 
when restricting term limits, he has 
surprisingly expressed support for 
Proposition 93 — a measure that 
would, on the surface, impose even 
more stringent regulations than 
those already in place. 

Perhaps this seeming con-
tradiction would explain why 
the Republican Party that 
Schwarzenegger purportedly repre-
sents does not even back the item. 
If Proposition 93’s motives were as 
honest and well-meaning as its pro-
ponents argue, voters would not be 
left scratching their heads and sec-
ond-guessing who will really reap 
the benefits of its passage.

In this case, if Proposition 93 
looks like a duck, walks like a duck 
and quacks like a duck — it’s prob-
ably a horse. 

includes former Massachusetts Gov. 
Mitt Romney and former Arkansas 
Gov. Mike Huckabee. While McCain 
continually stands by his core beliefs, 
Romney has left voters confused 
about his positions, the most nota-
ble example being his support for 
abortion as governor but a sudden 
turnaround on the issue now that 
he is trying to capture the White 
House. And Huckabee’s religious jar-
gon is often so alarming (bringing the 
Constitution in line with “God’s law”) 
that he has no broad appeal.

With this election’s outcome so 
crucial to our country’s future, voters 
should recognize McCain’s conviction 
and support him on Election Day.

Oval Office, where her familiarity 
with political structures, the players 
involved and the compacts they strike 
would grease the wheels to actually 
force change. But the biggest problem 
is that Clinton’s route toward change is 
exactly the kind that has been walked 
before, and runs counter to principles 
of change without harm. This America 
wants a new mentality, where the end 
does not justify the means.

Obama embodies that idealism, 
which makes a statement as strong as it 
is desirable for modern-day America: 
You don’t have to get dirty to play the 
political game.

sickly budget — before Proposition 1A 
was passed. Now, those transportation 
groups have turned on the measure

Without its founders’ backing,

With the very organizers of Proposition 
91 now speaking out against it, approv-

moves even more rigid. If the state 
were to haphazardly borrow from the

reinforce the state’s languishing transit

W hether it’s due to growing environmental principles or increasingly empty wallets, some UCSD students are flocking to trash as the answer to their consump-tion woes.
Freeganism, a term coined in the 1990s, is a way of living in 

which individuals reject the consumerist economy by practicing 
unconventional strategies such as Dumpster diving for food. Now 

with increased concern for the Earth’s climate, freeganism has 
become more popular among students like Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior Justin Lowenthal, a Sixth College resident advi-
sor who organized an educational event on freeganism for 
students during Fall Quarter 2007.

“Personally, it’s a value of mine to be more conservative,” 
Lowenthal said. “That’s what I want to introduce to other people 

so they can understand the impact they have being a con-
sumer in our society.”

In a similar effort to educate others, 
UCSD alumnus Marko Manriquez cre-
ated www.freegankitchen.com, a Web 
site where he hosts a gourmet cooking 
show using only ingredients taken 
from Dumpsters.

“The United States is a culture 
of enormous consumer appetites,” 
Manriquez said in an e-mail. “We con-
sume and waste so much but it never 
really seems to satisfy our desires. I 
wanted to share this revelation with 

others. I created [Freegan Kitchen] as 
a way to both satirize our consumer 
media bubble while at the same 
time empower others to alterna-
tive forms of sustainability — all 
the while leveraging the tools of 

the system to critique itself.”
In addition to offering cooking 

tips and insight into the movement’s 

main philosophies, Freegan Kitchen also includes an educational 
video on how to Dumpster dive. According to Manriquez, looking 
through Dumpsters is the most exhilarating part of freeganism.

“It’s fun and kind of a rush when you first get started and don’t 
know what to expect — like a scavenger hunt,” Manriquez said. 
“You name it, chances are it’s lying in a Dumpster somewhere.”

Although many UCSD students are interested in freeganism, 
Lowenthal said both issues of time commitment and local security 
can impede students looking to try out the lifestyle.

“It’s a lot easier to go to the store, you know?” Lowenthal said. 
“Especially here in La Jolla, there are not as many resources to get 
food because the grocery stores are a little stricter on their waste 
regulation. Because [of] the upscale nature of this place and [the 
fact that] it’s not that liberal here, it’s just harder to pull off.”

Manriquez, who is hoping to finish a Web-based widget appli-
cation by Earth Day that Dumpster divers can use to work around 
closed-off Dumpsters, agrees that this is a growing concern among 
freegans.

“This has become a problem as freeganism becomes a victim of 
its own success in terms of more and more Dumpsters becoming 
fenced off and locked up,” Manriquez said.

According to Matt Clark, the Villa La Jolla Drive Ralphs service 
manager, store policy bars individuals from rummaging through 
the store’s Dumpsters. Clark said that although the store discovers 
people looking through its Dumpsters two or three times a week, 
all employees are instructed to tell Dumpster divers to leave, and 
call mall security if they refuse.

Although Dumpster diving is illegal and, according to many 
supermarket policies, a liability if an individual becomes ill after 
eating discarded products, individuals can only technically sue if 
they can prove malicious intent of poisoning or contaminating the 
food. However, Marlon Geller, a UCSD alumnus and Freegan since 
2005 said staying safe is simply a matter of being aware.

“If you don’t take meat or dairy products out of the Dumpster 
this will increase your chances of not getting sick by a long shot,”

He’s Not Buying It
A profile of  Milton Saeir, campus professor and local dumpster-diver

On Sunday mornings around 8 a.m., 66-year-old biology professor 
Milton Saier fills his old Pontiac 
convertible with cardboard boxes 
and drives to a nearby Albertsons 
Dumpster in Encinitas. Wearing 
only a red bathing suit, he jumps 
in and sorts through discarded 
produce and products, filling his 
boxes with bananas, smoked salm-
on, pancake mix, plastic bottles 
— anything he deems fit to eat 
or recycle. While customers inside 
Albertsons are doing their weekly 
grocery shopping, Saier is doing 
his.

“It’s one of the most fun things 
I do,” Saier said. “It’s like Christmas 
every time you go to the Dumpster; 
you find something of interest and 
you never know what it will be.”

Saier, who first started 
Dumpster diving 30 years ago as 
a way to feed his farm animals, is 
a devoted freegan. As a concerned 
environmentalist and a natural-
born bargain lover, Saier sees his 
lifestyle as a result of his inherent 
qualities.

“There are some people who 

just derive natural pleasure from 
getting something free and I hap-
pen to be one of those people,” 
Saier said. “I think [freeganism] 
was a part of me before I even did it. 
Like, I could walk down the street 
when I was a kid and I would find 
something. Maybe it was a penny, 
maybe it was a nickel, maybe it was 
just a rock that appealed to me, and 
I would take pleasure in that.”

Although many might see 
Dumpster diving as potentially 
hazardous to one’s health, Saier 
says upper- and middle-class 
Americans are often too cautious 
about sterilizing their children’s liv-
ing conditions.

“In a study, they found out that 
the increased incidents of asthma 
in developed countries were due 
to the conditions of sterility when 
they raised their kids,” he said. 
“And the poorer classes in America 
and elsewhere in the world are not 
suffering from increased incidents 
of asthma. And when they raised 
piglets under comparable sterile 
conditions they also came down

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

I used to ride horses. Not very often, mind you, but enough to know a thing or two, and enough to get tired of it. 
Living the semi-rural life all the way up 
through high school, I learned to link horses 
with long hot days on the dusty valley floor 
outside Bakersfield, working my family’s 
cattle. I was glad to leave the hard hours in 
a saddle behind when I started college. But, 
like a lot of people who grow up and leave 
home, I began to miss my 
character’s foundry once I 
was cast from the mold. 
When my sister recently 
offered me a chance to go 
horseback riding with her 
and a friend, I jumped at 
the opportunity.

“You can take pictures,” my sister assured 
me, as if I needed further reason to go. She 
knows me well; a chance to take an interest-
ing picture is enough to get me to go just 
about anywhere.

On this occasion, though, I almost went 
without my camera. A horse demands your 
full attention, and I didn’t want to ruin both 
the ride and my camera by trying to juggle 
the two. I decided the best way to dodge a 
problem was to leave my bulky digital cam-
era at home and use my reliable film camera, 
a rangefinder.

My camera holds true to classic range-
finder form. The basic style has been around 
since the 1930s, and helped realize the genius 
vision of journalists and artists like Henri 
Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Garry 
Winogrand. Its design is simple: with few 
moving parts, it feels as solid as a brick in 
my hand. It’s also small and the shutter is 
discreet. There is no flash, nothing automatic 
and barely a flicker of electricity. When I first 
bought it, I went through dozens of rolls of 
film just getting used to how it feels looking 
through the viewfinder. So now, it is less of a 
piece of equipment and more of an extension 
of my eye, capturing intimate frames from 
moment to moment with fluid ease.

This is a camera I can trust, and so I 
brought it with me that sunset, when our 
truck and trailer were speeding out of town 
on an empty highway. The evening light was 

beautiful, but a mixed blessing. I had loaded 
my camera with film that would give me 
incredibly vivid colors, but the drawback 
was that it had very low sensitivity to light. 
In a cruel twist of irony, I had to accept that 
as the light faded and the sky became more 
dramatic, I would be less and less able to 
represent it faithfully.

At one point where the highway cross-
es a dry river, we unloaded our horses. I 

got acquainted with Buddy, 
the horse I would be rid-
ing. My sister and her friend 
would ride Lorenzo and 
Joe, respectively. I checked 
Buddy’s saddle, and added 
some length to the stirrups 
(as I’ve usually done as a tall 

person borrowing a shorter person’s equip-
ment). I was thrilled to hoist myself onto the 
saddle. I focused my camera on my sister’s 
cowboy hat and framed a photograph toward 
the west, into the setting sun. I turned Buddy 
around to view the trail,  took another photo 
and we headed east to begin our route along 
the sandy riverbed.

All my former confidence in my camera 
immediately vanished. My eye was steady 
and calm, but even with our horses at a slow 
walk, raising the camera to my eye made the 
world convulse. Nothing in the quiet, peace-
ful riverbed looked sensible through the ach-
ingly small viewfinder. I couldn’t make the 
beautiful images I wanted match the feeling 
I had inside. In denial, I made one last effort 
by stopping Buddy in his tracks. I took a pic-
ture of the two riders as the distance between 
us increased. Buddy did not like this — he is 
a leader, not a follower.

As I quickly cocked my shutter for a 
second photo, Buddy suddenly took off at a 
gallop toward the other two horses. I lost my 
hat to the wind, and my camera was loose 
and beating on my hip on every stride. I 
found out that it not only feels like a brick 
in my hand, but also against every part of 
my torso. One foot was out of the stirrup. 
I couldn’t hear it, but my pelvis tripped the 
shutter. This photo came back as a shot of 
my chin taken from waistline viewpoint. If 
it wasn’t so blurry you’d be able to see my 

clenched teeth.
Buddy, satisfied, slowed to a trot as he 

brought me back to the group. I was happy 
too, and not just because I hadn’t been 
thrown off. Despite the unexpected burst of 
speed, I had handled myself fairly well. After 
four years I hadn’t forgotten how to ride!

I brought Buddy to a lope to secure 
myself, and then we all worked in a few 
hard gallops over a half hour before turn-
ing around to head back. We stopped for a 
few minutes for group photos for the family 
album, but besides that my pictures alter-
nated between dark and blurry.

I didn’t mind. It’s rare to truly match expe-
riences with a still image anyway. Not that I 
can’t try, since it’s always nice to remember 
things through a photo, but a lot of the time 
a memory will do a better job. Nevertheless, 
even with a rank horse like Buddy between 
my legs, I still got in a few lasting shots.

From CALPIRG’s voter registration 
clipboard crew to a one-manned table 
with a loud boombox and some “Mike 
Huckabee for President” pamphlets, on-
campus, student-run political groups 
are determined to prod students to take 
a stance on today’s pressing issues. 

With the Feb. 5 primary election 
approaching, politically active students 
like Revelle College freshman Alec 
Weisman, an on-campus representa-
tive for the Presidential Campaign for 
Governor Mike Huckabee, are eager to 
influence the university’s young voters.

“I want to get involved on cam-
pus and do whatever I can,” Weisman 
said. “I’m here to show people that 
[Huckabee] has a presence [in San 
Diego]. [Huckabee] is pushing the 
fact that college is too expensive. In 
the lower education system he wants 
more teacher equality and more art 
and music in schools to help [students] 
become more well-rounded.” 

Out of their strong support for 
Texas Rep. Ron Paul, Revelle College 
seniors Jenny Cheng and Isaiah Sage 
founded the College Libertarians club. 
Although Paul later chose to run as a 
Republican, his change in status did 
not deter Cheng and Sage, who employ 
a whatever-it-takes approach in their 
campaigning. Though still a small club, 
College Libertarians find Facebook and 
tabling on Library Walk two ways of 
reaching UCSD students.

“What’s the point if we’re just meet-
ing and talking amongst ourselves?” 
Cheng said. “The point is to get people 
involved and get the word out. It’s nice 
to meet new people and get your ideas 
out there.”

Similarly, supporters of Sen. Hillary 
Clinton (D-N.Y.) are campaign-
ing  aggressively. Students for Hillary 
Clinton at UCSD managed to get 
Clinton to speak at a San Diego State 
University rally, which had an impres-

sive turnout of over 8,000. Covering 
issues such as veteran affairs and immi-
gration, Clinton catered to the region’s 
specific interests and addressed the ris-
ing prices of higher education. Reizza 
Ty, a Thurgood Marshall College senior 
and Students for Hillary Clinton at 
UCSD member, said the former first 
lady’s experience makes her an attrac-
tive and trustworthy candidate.

“Everyone says this, but [Clinton] 
does have the most experience,” Ty said. 
“She cares about college students and 
immigrants — she really speaks for the 
middle class.”

As a way to reach out to unin-
formed on-campus voters and urge 
them to consider Clinton’s take on vari-
ous issues, the group hosted a forum 
at Sixth College, where the candidate’s 
daughter, Chelsea Clinton, spoke with 
about 60 students.

“She reached out to undecided stu-
dent voters who might not know about 
Hillary Clinton’s policies,” Ty said. “Our 
whole campaign is based on social net-
works and just reaching out and talking 
to individuals. Even if it’s something 
small, it still makes a difference.”

 Students for Barack Obama has 
also made its presence and opinion 
known on campus. In conjunction with 
the Black Student Union, the organiza-
tion had originally scheduled a rally 
in Price Center featuring hip-hop star 
Nick Cannon to celebrate Black History 
Month and the progressive nature of 
Obama’s campaign on Feb. 1. However, 
university officials, regardless of assur-
ance from Students for Barack Obama 
that additional security was not need-
ed, felt that Cannon’s presence would 
present a liability issue. Administrators 
also told BSU that Cannon could not 
speak about Obama, since BSU did not 
officially support the candidate and it 
wasn’t part of the original event plan-
ning.

This is not the first time the admin-
istration has been a roadblock for politi-
cal action on campus. In 2004, only two 

on-campus polling places were open 
on Election Day, creating four-hour 
lines and preventing approximately 50 
percent of hopeful voters from submit-
ting their ballots. Although members 
of Students for Barack Obama hoped 
campus administration would change 
this, the number of polling places will 
remain the same. With young voters 
coming out in record numbers, the 
group expects lines to be six- to seven-
hours long this year.

Undaunted by the lack of support 
from campus officials, Students for 
Barack Obama has continued to focus 
on progressive change and to address 
young voters who have been absent at 
the polls in past years. 

“What’s really interesting and unique 
about the Obama campaign is that there 

are a lot of first-time voters and first-
time volunteers getting involved,” said 
John Muir College sophomore Marika 
Shiga. “And one reason why is that 
Obama really connects with a younger 
generation. He’s not just looking for 
normative change but a more funda-
mental, better way of doing politics. It’s 
about getting rid of divisive politics and 
having a new vision of unity.” 

While each on-campus political 
group has its own agenda, most orga-
nizations are mainly concerned with 
informing and involving people. Laura 
Fitzer, a Revelle College senior and 
College Democrats vice president of 
internal affairs, stressed the importance 
of simply getting UCSD students to 
vote, even if it isn’t for her party.

“My roommates last year were all 

Republicans and that was fine,” Fitzer 
said. “It doesn’t matter who you vote 
for. Vote Republican, vote Democrat 
— just vote.” 

UCSD’s student political organiza-
tions have also found new ways to make 
candidates relatable. CALPIRG’s Erin 
Steva, a recent UCSD graduate and 
campus organizer, encourages voter 
registration and is an active participant 
in the “What’s Your Plan” campaign. 
The campaign fights to increase presi-
dential candidates’ efforts to address the 
issues that college students find impor-
tant, such as global warming, making 
higher education more affordable and 
health care. Clinton has acknowledged 
the influence of the nationally orga-

nized “What’s Your Plan” program and 
has placed a number of her platform 
stances around such issues.

For liberal groups, the fight against 
global warming is an important politi-
cal topic among college students. 
CALPIRG participated in Focus the 
Nation, held on Jan. 31, which spread 
the word about environmental issues to 
students across the country.

Because of students’ concerns with 
future financial responsibilities and 
health-care costs, CALPIRG has also 
urged candidates to propose more 
affordable and reliable health-care 
plans. 

“We know that [Governor Arnold] 
Schwarzenegger isn’t going to pass a 
universal health-care initiative, so in 
the short we are in favor of expanding 
coverage and capping the costs,” Steva 
said. “For instance, there is a bill right 
now, ABX1-1 — it’s in the Senate and 
coming up [on the ballot] pretty soon, 
so we’re gathering petitions, and that’s 
our way of working toward reforming 
the health-care system.”

More conservative students are con-
cerned with the Iraq War and domestic 
economics.

“Contrary to popular belief, not all 
[College Republicans] are white, and 
a lot of us are immigrants,” said Mark 
Mendoza, Revelle College senior and 
President of the College Republicans. 
“Speaking from personal experience, I 
have seen how illegal immigration can 
hurt the economy. My family is in the 
medical field and I’ve seen the over-
crowding in hospitals. When it comes 
to the Iraq War, a lot of us have family 
members in the military or are in the 
military already. As for the domestic 
policy, we’re all about to go out in the 
work world and start making money, 
and we want to have a say in where our 
tax money is going.”

As opposed to the aggressive cam-
paigning of liberal groups such as 
CALPIRG and College Democrats 

at UCSD, College Republicans has 
encouraged more subtle political dis-
cussions at weekly forums held in 
Center Hall. By offering a less intense 
political atmosphere, Mendoza said the 
club appeals to conservative young vot-
ers who might be overwhelmed with 
liberal viewpoints of their peers.

Student activists feel it is important 
to show that young voters, however 
apathetic polls have proved them to be 
in the past, are an important group to 
cater to in the 2008 election.

“We’re the most ignored voter group 
out there, so we’re basically forcing can-
didates to pay attention to us,” Steva 
said. “[The ‘What’s Your Plan’ cam-
paign] has gotten to the point where 
[former North Carolina Sen. John] 
Edwards and Clinton know us and 
know our names, so when they see us 
they’ll answer our questions.”

Lyndsay Maier, a Marshall College 
senior and College Democrats vice 
president of external affairs, also men-
tioned student enthusiasm in the 2004 
presidential election, when 10,000 stu-
dents flocked to Price Center to see 
John Kerry speak.

“Students as a demographic are 
progressing,” she said. “More students 
are becoming more aware, and more 
students are voting … the fact that 
many students showed up [in 2004] on 
UCSD’s campus … shows that students 
are willing to pay attention and even 
more so when a candidate pays atten-
tion to them.” 

Shiga said voting in the Feb. 5 pri-
mary is a must for students.

“People get caught up in their own 
lives but there’s something about now 
that is urgent for us,” Shiga said. “We as 
students can really motivate our peers to 
get involved, and not only get involved, 
but be an informed voter. There’s an 
issue that’s important to everyone, 
whether they know it or not.”

with asthma and certain types of 
allergies that are common in humans. 
So, yeah, you can be too careful.”

While social stigmas about his 
freegan lifestyle don’t bother Saier, 
his larger obstacles are the anti-
Dumpster- diving policies of many 
grocery stores.

“It does upset me when some 
employee or some manager comes 
out and says, ‘Hey, you’re not sup-
posed to take that,’” Saier said. “I’ll 
respond and say, ‘Why not? Did you 
want it?’ I don’t see why anyone 
should object. If it’s something that 
was thrown away and it’s not to be 
used then why shouldn’t someone 
come along and take advantage of it 
if it’s of use to them?”

However daunting Dumpster-
related deterrents are, Saier has found 
clever ways to get around possessive 
policies, or at least reciprocate some 
benefit.

“I used to own some stock in 
Albertsons and I would tell them 
that I had the right because I owned 
the store,” Saier said. “I didn’t have 
very much but I decided I would buy 
a little since I was deriving so much 
benefit from them. I didn’t do well 
with their stock. They throw away 
billions of dollars worth of food a 
year.”

In addition to getting his grocer-
ies from the Dumpster, Saier also 
uses tree branches and other foliage 
from his neighbors’ trash cans to 
fill his farmland. According to Saier, 
the majority of plants in his 2.5-acre 
backyard started as recycled bits and 
pieces.

“Some trees, especially subtropical 
trees, will root if you just put them in 
the ground,” Saier said. “You break 
off a branch, stick it in the ground 
and it will grow. I have trees with 
huge diameters now which I planted 
when we first moved here just by 
sticking a branch in the ground.”

Saier’s commitment to recycling 
and reusing also extends to everyday 
activities. He bikes 16.6 miles to work 
from Encinitas each morning and 
returns home by bus. Besides special 
circumstances, Saier only uses his car 
to drive to the Dumpsters. He will 
buy retail gifts for others, but relies 
on thrift stores and swap meets for 
his own clothing and luxury items. 
Saier never rides elevators, never 
leaves the water on when he’s soap-
ing in the shower and always turns 
the lights off. Although these deeds 

are small, Saier said they add up.
“America is a land of waste. We’re 

all addicted to lifestyles of waste. 
And I’ve made an effort, a conscious 
effort, at least at first, in order to stop 
wasting everything.”

While Saier lives frugally, he is 
also dedicated to educating oth-
ers about important environmental 
issues. He has authored two volumes 
of the book “Our Precarious Earth 
and Its Biosphere” and regularly 
contributes to the Environmentalist 
and Water, Air and Soil Pollution 
journals. In addition to sponsering 
UCSD’s Human and Earth Rights 
Organization, Saier teaches a “Human 
Impact on the Environment” class 
and leads a freshman seminar enti-
tled “Earth’s Fragile Biosphere,” in 

which he discusses pollution’s detri-
mental effects on the environment 
and urges students to make a differ-
ence by conserving.

“I decided it would be a great 
assignment for my students, to have 
them write down 100 ways in which 
they could be more environmentally 
friendly,” Saier said. “There are really 
so many ways.”

Because Saier supports population 
control for the benefit of the environ-
ment, he also donates half of his 
annual salary to Planned Parenthood, 
the United Nations Family Planning 
Agency, Population Connection 
and Population Communications 
Incorporated — a nonprofit group 
that produces soap operas in under-
developed countries that encourage 
the use of birth control.

Although he is extremely active 
now, Saier didn’t become involved in 
environment conservation until he 
learned of the ocean’s depletion at a 
lecture six years ago. 

“I realized everything [the lectur-
er] said, I could confirm, based on my 
own personal experiences,” Saier said. 
“And it was on the basis of that knowl-
edge that I decided that I had to devote 
myself to environmental issues. And 
that’s what I’ve been doing since.” 

As both a freegan, an active teach-
er and a concerned scientist, Saier 
practices what he preaches in hopes 
that others will follow.

“Why should I condone an econ-
omy based on waste when it’s not 
benefiting me?” Saier said. “I see no 
reason. I think I can do better. I think 
I have personal responsibilities to the 
world. I think also, maybe, by doing 
so, I’m going to set an example for 
someone who’s going to change. And 
if enough people change then it really 
will make a difference.”

Saier Sets an Example for Consumers
▶ SAIER, from page 8

“Why should I condone an economy based on waste when it’s not benefiting me? I see 
no reason.”

— Milton Saier,
UCSD biology professor 

Geller said in an e-mail. “But, in 
general, you can tell if something is 
contaminated or not by using your 
senses. I know it seems too obvious, 
but look at it, smell it, sample it.”

While freeganism has caught the 
attention of many environmental-
ly concerned students, John Muir 
College junior Andre DaMetz, who 
learned about the movement from 
Lowenthal’s seminar and recently 
started Dumpster diving, said it is 
not enough to solve America’s waste 
issues. 

“I don’t think it will change the 
situation of all the waste that goes 
on in the United States,” DaMetz 
said. “I think the United States does 
waste a lot of food, and I think by 
being a freegan, it gives a personal 
gratification that you’re not contrib-
uting to the massive structural sys-
tem of waste. But it’s definitely not 
popular and I don’t think people will 
become freegans just because the 
concept of jumping into a Dumpster 
to receive food; I think there would 
be health concerns about it.”

According to Manriquez, people 
make choices about sustainability in 
all facets of daily living.

“I think sustainability or ‘being 
green’ or whatever label you wish to 
call it is something that pervades all 
aspects of life — we are each faced 
with the sustainable or not-suitable 
choice in pretty much every aspect 
of our lives,” Manriquez said in 
an e-mail. “There are many ways 
of integrating sustainability into 
our lifestyle. People just have to 
get creative and have fun with it 
— freeganism is just one way of 
doing that.”

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2008

team are focusing on the positives.
“We certainly didn’t play our best 

volleyball this weekend,” Ring said. 
“Heading into the weekend, we hadn’t 
played up to the same level that we had 
in the earlier season. But our defense 
has continued to improve and we are 
reading opposing hitters better. Our 
side out game has been better and now 
it’s just a matter of playing with a lead.”

Now standing at 3-7 overall, and 
1-7 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, UCSD is looking to reignite 
its once promising season.

“It’s pretty ridiculous,” sophomore 
outside hitter Jason Spangler said. “The 
fire is just not out on the court. We got 
together right after the [USC match] 
and said that on Monday we all need to 
state our motivations and find a way to 
achieve a victory. We’re trying to find 
who really wants to win.”

Pepperdine began the disastrous 
weekend Feb. 1 with a 30-28, 30-26, 
30-23 victory over UCSD. Ring knew 
Pepperdine’s talent before the game 
but was pleased with his team’s perfor-
mance during the first two games.

“I thought we played really well 
[during] the first two games,” Ring said. 
“We sided out really well but we just 
don’t have the same heat at the service 
line and blocking is definitely a nega-
tive factor for us. We knew it was going 
to be a challenge, but it was our youth 
and inexperience that really showed.”

In game one, UCSD held a two-
point lead before watching it evaporate. 
Pepperdine scored eight of the next 10 
to take a 20-16 advantage. The Tritons 
closed the gap to one at 29-28 but were 
unable to complete the comeback. The 
Tritons held a 21-18 lead in game two 
but were stymied after the Waves took 
six of the next seven points to take a 
24-22 lead. Pepperdine’s offense proved 
too much, closing out the second game 
with four kills. Things never looked 
promising in the third game as UCSD 
fell behind early and wasn’t able to claw 
its way back into the match.

The height advantage at the net 
proved to be a larger difference than 
either Ring or the players had expect-
ed. Pepperdine recorded 15 blocks 
to UCSD’s five. While UCSD tallied 
more kills than the Waves, the Tritons 
recorded double the number of hitting 
errors. Spangler noted that UCSD is not 
intimidating enough at the net, allow-
ing opposing teams to swing away.

“[Pepperdine and USC] have 
more discipline with blocks and 
are more intimidating,” he said. 
“Blocking is just not what we work 
on during practice and it shows 
during the games. Night after night 
we’re not a threat at the net.”

UCSD hoped to rebound against 
USC on Feb. 2 but were again swept in 
their home building. The Trojans clob-
bered the Tritons 30-26, 30-22, 30-26. 
UCSD never looked energized as USC 

dominated all aspects of the match.  
The two teams traded points 

throughout the first game, with the 
last of 10 ties coming at 20. UCSD ral-
lied behind senior outside hitter Russ 
Hardy, who gave the Tritons a two point 
cushion after an ace. But the Trojans 
responded with a five-point run and 
eventually closed out the game. Game 
two was uninspiring for the Tritons, as 
they fell behind early and were unable 
to stop the Trojan offense.

Hoping to prevent the sweep, UCSD 
opened game three scoring nine of the 
first 10. The Trojans battled back, tying 
the game at 15 and later opening a 
two-point lead at 20-18. Not wanting 
to go down without a fight, the Tritons 
dug deep, scoring five of the next seven 
to retake the lead at 23-20. But once 
again, the late game lead disappeared 
during USC’s seven point run to close 
the game.

Ring pointed to a number of prob-
lems that may have caused distractions, 
but he didn’t make excuses.

“Sure, we were in a different time 
zone, a few guys have colds, all have 
midterms and we’re putting 20 hours a 
week in as an athlete,” he said. “No one 
said being a student athlete is easy but 
every other team in the league is deal-
ing with the same things we are. You 
can’t make that an excuse.”

SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN
According to UCSD men’s volleyball head coach Kevin Ring, it is USC’s discipline with blocks and intimidation 
at the net that puts the Tritons at such a disadvantage, like what they faced in a three-game sweep on Feb. 2.

the whole Spirit Weekend fiasco.”
The Warriors opened the second 

half scoring with a three-pointer that 
cut the lead to four, but UCSD built 
some distance after five straight points 
from junior forward Darryl Lawlor. 
Junior guard Andrew Hatch converted 
a three-point play at the 13:10 mark 
that extended the Triton lead to double-
digits and the UCSD defense prevented 
Cal State Stanislaus from getting closer 
than eight points the rest of the way. 
Two three-pointers brought Stanislaus 
within nine at 54-63 with 3:57 remain-
ing, but a 9-0 Triton run ended any 
comeback hopes inside Warrior Arena.

Patterson and sophomore guard 
Jordan Lawley led UCSD with 15 
points each, while junior guard Kelvin 
Kim added 13 points and senior guard 
Clint Allard chipped in 11. UCSD held 
Cal State Stanislaus to only 34.6 percent 
field-goal shooting in the second half, 
with the Tritons’ 38-15 rebounding 
edge making up for their 19 turnovers 
in the game.

The Tritons started slowly against 
Chico State, scoring only eight points in 
the first 12 minutes of the game. After 
shooting only 1-of-7 from three-point 
range to start the game, UCSD would 
convert 3-of-6 long-range opportuni-
ties to end the half. Kim connected on 
his final two trey attempts of the half, 
including one with under a minute to 
play that cut the Chico State lead to six 
heading into the break.

“We were rushing a lot of shots 
[in the first half],” Hatch said. “We 
just calmed down. [Chico State guard 
Darroll] Phillips got off to a really good 
start, and so we just locked him up. We 
let [guard Justin] Argenal just drive, 
and just let him try to score and not let 
him dish off to the bigs.”

The Tritons found themselves in 
a nine-point hole early in the second 
half after six straight points from the 

Phillips. Determined to end their two-
game conference losing streak, UCSD 
stepped up on both ends of the court. 
As the defense held Chico State score-
less for seven-and-a-half minutes, 
Patterson put in three lay-ups, Hatch 
added another two field goals and 
Lawlor connected on a three. Following 
that 13-0 run, the Tritons would not 
trail the rest of the game. Tied at 40 
with just over six minutes remaining, 
UCSD put the game out of reach. After 
putting up only 21 points in the first 
half, the Tritons scored 22 in the final 
six minutes of the game, converting 
15-of-19 from the free-throw line, and 
securing the 13-point victory.

“We just knocked down free-
throws,” Hatch said. “We didn’t want 
to lose the lead. They tried to pressure 
us, so as soon as we got the ball up the 
floor we were looking to score. We were 
getting to the basket, they were fouling 
a lot, trying to block shots, and we were 
pump-faking. We just took our time.”

Patterson led UCSD in scoring 
with 19 points on 7-of-9 shooting. Kim 
scored 13 points, while Hatch added 10. 
Allard scored eight points and recorded 
team-highs of six rebounds and six 
assists. After shooting only 29.2 per-
cent from the field in the first half, the 
Tritons converted 11-of-17 from the 
field in the second half. The Wildcats, 
on the other hand, made 7-of-24 field 
goals in the second half and had 16 
turnovers to only 10 for the Tritons.

“Losing those two games at home 
woke us up a little bit,” Hatch said. “We 
were 7-0 at home and then we dropped 
two heartbreakers in overtime. We real-
ly matured in those two games.”

UCSD returns home next weekend 
to take on No. 17 Humboldt State on 
Feb. 8. The two squads are currently 
tied for second in the CCAA.

alive. Albitz then stole second, which 
became mute when junior second-
baseman Garrett Imeson homered to 
left-centerfield.

“That just tells you how impor-
tant every single run is because you 
never know when that run will mat-
ter,” Rodiek said. “So having that 
two-run bomb kept our team in it 
and ended up being the difference.”

While the opening game was 
encouraging for the Tritons, they 
came back on Feb. 2 and faced a rude 
awakening from the Wolves, first 
falling 11-10 in extra innings after 
rallying to tie the game in the ninth 
and then taking a 3-1 loss in the sec-
ond game of the doubleheader.

In the first game, the Tritons 
found themselves facing a 2-1 deficit 
after the first three innings of play. 
Both offenses exploded in the fourth 
innings, as the Wolves put up a five-
spot in the top of the inning and the 
Tritons answered with four runs of 
their own in the bottom half.

While UCSD was able to answer 

the original rally, Western Oregon 
kept tacking on runs, adding two 
more in the fifth inning and one 
more in the eighth. The Tritons kept 
within reach with a two-run seventh 
inning, but found themselves down 
10-7 in the bottom of the ninth 
inning. 

Albitz led off the do-or-die 
inning with a single and advanced 
to third on a Cantele double to right 
field. He then scored the first of 
three runs that started a Triton rally 
that tied the game and forced extra 
innings. Unfortunately, the Tritons 
used all their energy tying the game 
and quickly found themselves trail-
ing again after the Wolves hit a one-
out double and scored on a two-out 
single. The Tritons then went down 
1-2-3 in the bottom of the tenth 
to take their first loss of the young 
season.

After the disappointment of fall-
ing in extra frames, the Tritons had 
to prepare for a second game, which 
they lost 3-1. UCSD came out swing-
ing, as Albitz led off the game with a 

triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by 
Imeson. But that was the only run 
the team could muster and freshman 
starting pitcher Guido Knudson, 
who was pitching flawlessly through 
four innings, ran into trouble in 
the fifth when he allowed back-to-
back singles with two outs. Despite 
the threat, Knudson looked like 
he was going to escape the inning 
unscathed, but a catcher’s interfer-
ence call kept the inning alive and 
allowed the Wolves to score three 
unearned runs and take the 3-1 lead 
they would never surrender.

“Our whole team knows there 
is a lot of room for improvement,” 
Rodiek said about the Tritons’ chanc-
es in the postponed game. “We must 
be focused and we have to pounce 
on them from the first inning and 
never look back.”

UCSD will look to salvage a split 
in the series in the postponed fourth 
game on Feb. 4 at 2 p.m.

HOT CORNER

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons entered last weekend’s games 
with a chance to climb into first place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings, but with a split 
on the road, UCSD remains tied for 
third place. The Tritons took a 60-51 
loss to first-place team Chico State 
on Feb. 1 before bouncing back with 
a 67-57 win over Cal State Stanislaus 
on Feb. 2.

UCSD didn’t bounce back from its 
loss to Chico State until the second half 
of its game against Cal State Stanislaus. 
The Tritons started the game well, as 
sophomore forward Erin Noonan hit 
a three-pointer four minutes into the 
game to give the Tritons an early 9-5 
lead. The Warriors answered back with 
a three-pointer of their own and, after a 
foul by senior forward Meaghan Noud, 
took the lead on a jump shot.

The Warriors led for the rest of the 
half, controlling the game and forcing 
UCSD into a poor shooting half. The 
Tritons had many opportunities to get 
back in the game, but were unable to 
make their free-throw attempts, shoot-
ing a mere 2-10 from the line. 

The Warriors’ offense had no trou-
ble scoring and took a 33-20 lead after 
hitting another three-pointer with 1:29 
left. Then senior center Diahnn Futalan 
made one out of two free-throws, and 
the Tritons entered halftime trailing the 
Warriors by a score of 33-21.

The Tritons immediately turned the 
game around in the second half ’s open-
ing minutes. Field goals by Futalan, 
Noonan and junior forward Michelle 
Osier led the Tritons in their 11-0 run 
to start the second half. With 15:14 left 
in the game, Futalan’s two free-throws 
cut the Warriors’ lead to 33-32. 

“We kind of got yelled at at halftime 
and that made us come out really hard 
in the second half,” Osier said. “We 
were aggressive and driving to the bas-
ket. We knew what we had to do.”

The Tritons then changed their for-

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Both 
Pepperdine and USC brought their 
brooms to San Diego over the weekend, 
as both powerhouse teams came away 
with sweeps over the No. 15 Tritons.
As harsh as it sounds, the Tritons were 
a shadow of their early-season selves 
both nights. 

Despite playing well in two games 
against the Waves, UCSD never found 
a rhythm and lacked that spark.

After beating Princeton on Jan. 30, 
head coach Kevin Ring admitted that 
the team hadn’t played to its peak and 
had some work to do before the next 
games. Even after a lackluster perfor-
mance this weekend, Ring and the

tunes from the free-throw line, taking 
their first lead in the half on a free-
throw from sophomore guard Annette 
Ilg that put them on top by a score of 
43-42 with 10 minutes left. 

Led by Osier, UCSD continued its 
offensive attack, extending its lead and 
controlling the game. With Osier lead-
ing the offensive scoring and the Tritons 
hitting their free-throw attempts late in 
the second half, UCSD was able to 
complete its 67-57 comeback victory.

The Tritons outscored the Warriors 
46-24 in the second half and shot 20-
of-23 from the charity stripe. Osier 
led all scorers with 28 points and col-
lected a game-high 13 rebounds for 
UCSD. Noud and Noonan also added 
11 points each for the Tritons.

“Osier had 24 points in the second 
half,” Elliott said. “She came out with a 
different intensity that carried over to 
the rest of the team and set the tone for 
the second half.”

UCSD needed the win against Cal 
State Stanislaus to preserve its tie for 
third place, after suffering losing to 
Chico State. UCSD’s offense struggled 
mightily in the first half against Chico 
State, shooting only 22 percent from 
the floor. Despite their struggles on the 
offensive end, the Tritons were able to 
stay close in the game, taking a 13-12 
lead on a three-pointer from Noud 
with 9:29 left in the half.

The Tritons only managed to score 
15 points in the half, but they held the 
Wildcat offense at bay to enter halftime 
facing only a nine-point deficit.

UCSD’s offense showed improve-
ment in the second half, scoring 10 
quick points to cut Chico State’s lead 
to two points. The Wildcats answered 
back with their own run, hitting a 
three-pointer with 12 minutes left in 
the contest to give Chico State a 40-27 
lead. The Tritons continued to fight, 
but the Wildcats’ efficient offense was 
too much for UCSD to overcome. 

The Wildcats shot an impressive 
65 percent from the field in the second 
half, allowing UCSD no chance to keep 
up offensively with them in the game. 

Noud led the Tritons with 20 points in 
the loss and Osier added 12 points with 
12 rebounds.

“We would have obviously liked to 
get two wins, but coming out with a big 
win on the second night was definitely 
a good thing.”

The loss to Chico State and win over 
Cal State Stanislaus gave the Tritons an 
8-4 CCAA record and a 16-6 record 
overall. UCSD will have a chance to 
distance themselves from Sonoma 
State, with whom they currently share 

third place, when the two teams face 
each other on Feb. 9 at RIMAC Arena. 
The Tritons will also face Humboldt 
State at home on Feb. 8. 

“We lost to both of these teams 
earlier in the season and they were not 
good memories,” Elliott said. “We need 
to have a good week of practice and 
figure out a way to keep the intensity 
going. Every single game is important.”

BASEBALL — After a 1-2 start in 
three games versus Western Oregon, 
the UCSD baseball team had the 
finale of its four-game season-open-
ing series postponed after rain pelted 
Triton Baseball Field on Feb. 3, forc-
ing the Tritons to wait until today to 
try and finish with a split.

The Tritons, ranked 15th in 
Division II and picked by league 
coaches to finish first in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association and 
win the postseason conference tour-
nament, did exactly what they wanted 
to do in the season opener on Feb. 1. 
Thanks to a dominant performance 
by sophomore starting pitcher Matt 
Rossman and two two-run home 
runs, UCSD came away with a 4-3 
victory.

Rossman, making the first start of 
his collegiate career, mowed down the 
Wolves, striking out nine over seven 
innings of one-hit, one-run ball. 

“[Rossman’s] definitely going to 
be a big impact pitcher for us this sea-
son,” senior closer Nick Rodiek said. 
“He’s a true competitor out there and 
we’re lucky to have him. He goes out 
there, he throws strikes, he gets ahead 
in the count and that’s really what you 
need to be successful.”

Despite Rossman’s near-perfect 
performance, the Wolves kept them-
selves in the game with a single run 
each in the seventh, eighth and ninth 

innings. Rodiek earned the save by 
recording the last four outs of the 
game, though he left the Wolves an 
opening, allowing two hits and one 
run in his 
outing.

“ B e f o r e 
the season my 
coaches told 
me I would 
be in the clos-
er role,” Rodiek said. “Last season I 
was middle relief so it was definitely 
a different mindset for me. When 
they told me, I knew I had to be on 
my game from the get-go. There’s no 
room for error so I told myself to be 
aggressive and it was really important 
to be successful my first time out 
there.”

UCSD only got six hits in the 
game, but they capitalized, hitting 
two home runs with one man on 
base. After trading scoreless innings 
to start the contest, UCSD scored first 
in the bottom of the fourth, when 
junior first-baseman Matt Cantele led 
off the inning with a single. Cantele 
came around to score when junior 
outfielder Evan Domanic cleared the 
right-field fence. 

In what would become crucial 
insurance runs, UCSD came back in 
the bottom of the fifth and added 
another two runs. A two-out error put 
sophomore shortstop Vance Albitz 
on the basepath and kept the inning

MEN’S BASKETBALL — After a week-
end road sweep, UCSD has moved 
back to second place in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association and 
stands only one game behind the top 
conference spot. The Tritons rebound-
ed from a slow first half to defeat Chico 
State 62-49 on Feb. 1, and needed less 
than five minutes to take the lead for 
good against Cal State Stanislaus, pick-
ing up a 75-58 victory on Feb. 2. The 
team now stands at 12-6 overall and 8-4 
in conference play.

Despite playing only 11 minutes in 
the opening half, junior forward Henry 
Patterson made an early impact, scor-
ing four of the first seven points and 10 
points in the half, while also grabbing 
four boards. Trailing for less than one 
minute of game time, UCSD led in the 
opening half by as much as 11 points. 
The Tritons found themselves ahead 
early due to 5-of-8 three-point field 
goals and a 16-8 rebounding advantage, 
dominating the boards throughout the 
game, with their first half total exceed-
ing the 15 rebounds Cal State Stanislaus 
collected in the entire game.

“Our defense was there the entire 
night,” junior guard Andrew Hatch 
said. “Henry’s been doing a great job 
of posting up and really clearing out 
the lanes. They’re doubling on him and 
then there’s open shots outside. We’re 
definitely being more aggressive and 
attacking the basket. I think that’s defi-
nitely something we kind of lost during
