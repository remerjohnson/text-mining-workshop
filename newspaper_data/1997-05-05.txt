you're damn close, but I'm thinking of 
another Bill Clinton fave. 

SlUmped, arc ye? Ii musl he the 
"artist" part that confuses you. Allow 
me to clarify : This 22-year-old San 
Diegan in question is a musician -
and fan cics herself a poet - bulto ca ll 
her an "anist " de means the word, as 
well as insult s true artists everywhere. 

You might have been unfortunate 
enough to catch hcr ca r-wrenching 

~ hart - I opper, "Who Will ave Your 
oul." Who hasn' t, cons idering 92.5 

"The rlash" and ot her aliernalive rock 
stati ons played it unlil our car bled'! 

If you haven' t realizcd by now Ihat 
I'm talking about Jewel, then you must 
he one of the few privileged souls that 
ha, yet to be suhjected to her sappy 
new ~()ng "You Were Mea nt for Me." 
which i!> currently hogging Ihe air-
wave,. Though J' e tried every Ill ean~ 

pos~ ihl e to end thi s mise ry - from 
ex tensive lohbying allempls in 
Was hington to have the album banned, 
10 underhanded cl'rorts 10 impli cale Ihe 
harpy in some kind of Milli Vanilh -
Iype fia sco - all altempts have fai led. 

Isn' l il amazing how loose ly Ihe 
lerm "artist" ~an be applied ') I, for 
one, wouldn 't use the lahel in refer-
ence 10 the songwriler responsihle for 
lyrics like "I hear the clock I It 's six 
a.m. I I fee l so far from where [' ve 
been I GOI my eggs and my pancakes 
too / Got my maple syrup, everyth ing 
hUI you." Calling Jewel an arti sl is like 
ca lling Syl vester Stallone a thespi an 
- both arc quite a streich. 

It 's been said that music is candy -
for the soul. Obviously, whoever said 
Ihat was hlissfulty ignorant of today 's 
brand of ~accharin -sweet tunes, full of 
artili cial sentiments and retread emo-
tions. Laboratory tests have shown that 
ir you lis ten to loo much of it , you ' re 
li able to contract cancer. 

I have n' t always been thi . cynical 
about pop music . Long before I knew 
any heller, I mindless ly placed my 
hard-earned 12.99 on the counter for 
Bu 'h, Pearl Jam, Hootie and thc rc,1 of 
it. 

That i~ until I rca li/ed thaI Ihey 
were all pari of the ~amc ~molderi ng

ARTICLE SMEARED EARTH-DAY PARTICIPANTS 
Editor: 

Chris Schreiber docs himself a 
disservicc by selective ly picking 
out the elements he found distaste-
ful at thi s year's Earth Day festival 
("Exposing thc Si ll ine s of Earth 
Day 1997," Guardian. April 2 , 
1997). Perhaps he was thcre at Ihe 
wrong ti me. I was present when the 
event started, and I enjoycd I he 
mellow jazz of UCSO's own

only did they wear gender-appro-
priate clothes, but they had "nor-
mal" haircuts. too. So did many 
other people - such as the people 
occupying tables for San Diego 
County Solid Waste, County 
Household Hazardous Materials , 
UCSD Recycling, The Natural 
Gourmet, Citizens for Clean Air, 
etc. 

Regarding the "petition squad," 
thc recycling petition docs not in 
any way propo e to raise student 
fees for plastics recycling. As to 
Mr. Schreiber 's confusion over the 
"environmentally correct " hai rcut s 
(n fundrai sing aClivity), had he cho-
sen to speak wi th the representa-
ti ves who were there. raci may 
have replaced ~ uppos iti o n . 
Everyhody is fully entilled 10 hi s 
own opi nion. but one\ credibi lity 
is grealer when. in, tead of relying 
upon appearancc, to P<J" judg-

ment, one chooses to communicate 
opcnly to obtain information. 

Kirk Belles 

Schreiber Made 
False Accusations 
Editor: 

Observation based on fact is 
permissible, but outrighl attacks on 
siudent organi zat ions try ing to 
make a difference is inexcusable. 
Mr. Schreiber's article and its igno-
rant and hasty interpretalion • espe-
cially regarding the plastic-recy-
cling petitions, are partieul"rly 
poignant. The pelitions in no way 
advocate raising student fees for 
il11plementing a plastic-recycling 
program on campus. And cven if 
there were to be a fcc increase, it 
would only equate to about 20 
<.:e l1ls per siudent. The petitioners 
specifica lly tated that Ihe purpose 
of the pelilions i 10 raise student 
awa reness and support for an 
appeal to the administration to pro-
vide Ihe necessary financial back-
ing to implemenl Ihe program. 

I further suggest Ihat hefore Mr. 
chreiber. edi tor in chief of Ihe 

Cuardial/, imposes any more fal se 
information upon hi . readers. Ihal

increasi ngly unamused as I begin 
to realile that the Stuart Art 
Co llec tiQn and its adl11ini trators 
do not encourage the exploration 
of artistic ex pression and va lue, 
bUI rather arc a controlling and 
oppressive forcc Ihal works to 
hinder whatever artistic ex pres-
sion it does not choose to approve 
or fund . 

I was unse ttl ed 10 read Ihe 
Gllardian's account or Ihe "vandal -
ism" Ihal took place al Ihe spheres 
next to Center Hall ("Vandals 
Defile Center Hall Spheres," April 
28. 1997), because it chose to focus 
on Ihe aspect of vandali sl11 instead 
of protest. This art icle was high ly 
biased. focusi ng mostly on the 
rea~tions of Ihe Stuarl Art people 
and Ihe clean-up expenses. 

Walking past the painl-splal-
tered spheres on my way to class, I 
found thai not many studcnts 
under tood what was being protest-
ed, and even mi sinterpreled il to be 
a commenlary against random 
Sluart Art pieces in genera l. In hoth 
cases. Ihe event of "campus graffi -
Ii" as Ihe Cllordi{/II was apl 10 dis-
mi ss it , was Illi ~ inl crprctcd and it s 
trlle meaning ohscured. 

The Sluarl Arl adl11ini strato r~ 
have heen cau, lIlg a ,til', urging the 
relllmal of the nUl11erous ~pherc, 
around Cenler Hall for nHlIlth .. . 

They fear that the spheres will be 
misi nterpreted as a part of the 
Sluart Art Collection hy visitors. 
They fail 10 recognize the fael that 
the spheres are an integral part of 
the plan of Center Hall . and arc the 
arehilecl's artistic imprint on the 
bui lding. Getting rid of them means 
Ihe acceplance oJ' the Stuart Art 
committee and ils inlerprelation of 
arl and aesthetics. 

I refuse to helieve that the Sluart 
Art Collec tion comlil illee should 
be the only authori ty determining 
our aesthetic values and environ-
ment here at UCSD. This is not Ihe 
Stuan Art University. The spheres 
that were installed as a pan of 
Centcr Hall have every right to 
exist as a part oflhe uni versi ly, jusl 
as Ihe Red Silot' ex i ts as part or Ihe 
Stuart Art Collection. 

The painl splattered on the 
spheres sought to draw allent ion 10 
the exist ing prohlem. Let's not turn 
a blind eye to the perva 'ive belief 
I hat money l11akes I he world go 
around. The Sluart Art Ollcclion 
has much money to give. While 
they may w ntinue to commis!>ion 
as many art bls as they wish to add 
to their collection. Ihe)' cannot and 
should not he allowed 10 diclate 
what W\: think or as \vhim,icai.

EXCUSES: 
Bad habits lead to 
declining grades 
Continued from page 4 
respond, ' 'Well, the class might not 
have been so diffkul1 if you had 
actually opened a book for it." 
However, the scapegoat must be 
handled with the utmost tact. A sim-
ple, "Just try harder next time," will 
usually get the scapegoat olf the sub-
ject and on to the popular "New 
Quaner Resolutions." 

If you are unlucky enough to get 
comered into hearing the scapegoat 
proclaim, 'Til go to the library every 
day, read the chapter before class 
and go to' every office hour," resist 
the temptation to laugh. Everybody 's 
got to have dreams. Who knows, 
maybe he ' ll actually do it. 

For those who can see pans of 
themselves in these characte.rs, all is 
not lost. Amazing things can be 
achieved by simply showing up to 
t:lass. Classes are given on weekdays 
in the middle of the day. What else 
do you have to do'? Believe me, 
Montel can wait. Just by attending 
lecture, some of the crucial informa-
tion might actually lodge itself in 
your brain. 

If you fi nd that you have prob-
lems with your study habits, there are 
programs designed to help you 
develop healthier study skills. For 
instance, Methods of Inquiry is a 
two-unit class in which students 
leam to take more effective notes and 
improve their overall study habits. 

Fi nally, take an active role in 
class. If you are interested in the 
material, learning it often happens as 
a side effect. The easiest way to 
develop interest is to get in volved in 
class discussions and attend the pro-
fessor 's offi ce hours. By gelling 
involved in discussions, the TA will 
get to know you , and your intelligent 
eommenls will knock his sock ofT. 
Many professors are just dying for 
students to show interest in their 
classes. Students .:an usually expect 
a positive impact on their grades if 
they choose to attend onice hours. 

Everyone procrastinates occa-
siona lly. Used in moderation, pro-
crastinati on can even give you a 
hea lthy respite rrom the strain of 
classes. However, trying to complete 
and memorize 12 chapters the night 
before finals is a prohlem. While you 
deserve to have fun , you still have 
the rcsponsibi li ty 10 get the joh done. 

College is designed l'or acade-
mics, as we ll as a place 10 interact 
with others and learn the socia l 
graces that will help you maneuver 
through life. But the moral still is: 
Everything in moderat ion. ollege i, 
not onl y a place to have fu n. It i~ a 
place to learn. Go ahead - prncra~­
tinate on that a~,ign ill e nt , hut don 'l 
hlal11\.: ,omeone else when your 
(lverindulgence In procra,tlllation 
gets you into trouhle.

MUSIC: 
Today's singers 
are not artists 
Continued from pace 4 
The worst pan of it is that these 
bands think they have some real 
message to convey - they 
believe that they' re breaking bar-
riers with their hollow walls of 
noise - and that makes me sick. 
For which generation do they 
think they' re speaking? Not mine. 

The bolt of lightning that 
enabled me to see the truth struck 
a few years ago when the insipid 
Brit-pop group Oasis enjoyed 
brisk sales on its first album, and 
hastily labeled itself "the next 
Beatles." Not only did Oasi s 
insult a truly great ro.:k band 
wi th this ludicrous comparison, 
but in the process it spat upon the 
pioneering effect of the Beatles. 
In their heyday, McCartney and 
co mpany bent some rules and 
redefined the music industry. 
Oasis, meanwhile, sounds 
remarkably like the Beatles. 
What 's so rule-breaking about 

The UCSD Guardian 

that? 
Just about everybody sounds 

like someone else these days . All 
of the candy tastes the samc, 
whether it be the cobwebbed 
Seallie grunge scene or the brain-
numbing wails of Jewel and hcr 
ilk . By "her ilk" I mean Sheryl 
Crow, Joan Osborne, Alanis 
Morissette: Fiona Apple - pick 
your poison. 

It ' s not that I neccssari I y take 
ext:e ption with these ladi es 
because of their stunning lack of 
originality and creativity. I mean, 
let's face it - if you can produce 
a triple-platinum album by tread-
ing upon the well-beaten path, 
and you don ' t have moral prob-
lems with that, then more power 
to you. Just don'l in ult our intel -
ligence by passing off the resul -
tant schlock as art. If that 's art, 
then Di Ibert-creator Scott Adams 
is Pab lo Picasso. 

Oh, but let's all shed a tear or 
two for the constant obstacles 
faced by these "artist s" as they 
strive to ac hieve their aesthetic 
vision without compromise . 
Sheryl Crow, after all , had to 

wilhstand the ignominy of being 
bvycotted by Wal -Mart , which 
took exception to a lyri c from her 
new album about a kid buying a 
gun from the retail chain. 

Crow, always the consummate 
artist , refused to censor her song 
because, goshdamil. her message 
about the kid, the gun and Wal -
Mart was just too important to 
·acrifice. I mean, imagine what 
would happen if Crow hadn ' t 
been allowed to get this message 
out to the consuming public. 
What' s 500,000 albums when 
deep messages sueh as this are 
concerned? 

Well , I've heard your mes-
sage, Crow. Loud and clear. You 
were eager to garner some free 
pres for yourself. By opposing 
the nation's largest retail chain , 
you got gobs of it. 
Co ngratulations. And hey, in the 
process you convi nced the brain-
less music-buying public that you 
have some deep vision that can 
actually be compromised - pre t-
ty heady stuff for a woman whose 
deep lyrics include, "rf it makes 
you happy I it can' t be that had I 

OPINION 7 

If it makes you happy / then why 
the hell are you so sad?" Maybe 
your reso lve is impressive, Crow, 
bUI the message itself is .. . well ... 
dumb. 

But, kind reader, you know 
what the irony of it all i '7 It 's not 
"A traffic jam when you ' re 
already late / a no-smoking sign 
on your cigarette break" as 
Alanis screeches in the song 
"Ironic." It 's that these pop musi-
cians - with their cliched mes-
sages and pompous se lf-right -
eousness - are laughing all the 
way to the bank. We're the 
chumps for buying and li stening 
to this pablum.

UNION:uCSD 
says TAs, RAs are 
students first 
Continued from page 1 
interfere with UC graduate acade-
mil: employees," Navarrete said, 
'The administration acts as if the 
Universi ty of California is a labor 
institution unique in the uni verse 
and PERB should not involve 
itse lf. They feel that PERB does 
not know the fum;tion of the uni -
versity. " 

At a recent union meeting, 
avarrete said that whi le the public 

may view the graduate-student 
cmployees' strike as pay- related, 
thc reality is that the union wa nts to 
establish fair lahor po li cies. 

"According to officia l policy, a 
graduate-student employee cannot 
grieve work load issues," avarrete 
said . 'T here is not a specific work-
load policy:· 

Navarrete added that the union 
wa nt s to establi sh policies to defin e 
employee rights, ensure depend-
able health care, create a workah le 
sexual· harassment policy and set 
out clear workload specifil:ations 
like ·'hours-per-week" scheduling 
and class sizes. 

Quang Tong, a Roosevelt senior 
present at the union meeting, ~aid 
he agrees wi th the role of unions in 
labor relations, hut di sagrees with 
UC D's graduate student ~ 
demanding unioni7.at ion and col-
kcti vc-hargallling rights. 

"My fri ends and I support 
unioni t;ation, but we do not suppOrt 
the graduate student ' unioni/a-
tion," Tong said, " I understand 
their needs, but thi s is not their 
career. Ir thi s was their career, com-
ing day in and day out, then I 
would agree: ' 

Sworder said the uni versi ty 
maintains the stance that graduate 
student employees reap educational 
benefits from their job experience 
and are therefore students more 
than employees. 

"Our belier is that the students 
are students and they benefit from 
thei r posi tions at an educa tional 
level: ' he said , 

Sworder added that administra-
tors view the Graduate Student 
Association (GSA) as the proper 
vehicle of communication between 
graduate students and UCS D 
admi nistrators. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes will 
speak to the GSA at an open meet -
ing tonight at 6 p.m, in the North 
Conference Room, and the union 
wi ll stage a ra lly on Wednesday at 
noon near the Hump and the Old 
Student Center to begin the strike.

your other fri ends. Preferably, you 
want to do Ihis in the Price Center, 
where you can heckle hundreds of 
sober people. If you don' t live 0n 
campus, I ~uggest finding an alter-
nate means of transport al ion and 
avoiding Ihat DUt. 

"Why do this" you ask " 
Simple: From then on, whenever 
you arc walking Ihrough campus 
and really feeling the place drag 
you down, you can walk through 
Ihe Price Center (or wherever else 
you stumbled during your drunken 
romp) and think about all the 
funny things thai happened. 
Instant pick-me-up. It 's thai ea~y. 

I al so reco mmend pl aY ing 
intramural sport s. Whether you're 
alhletically inclined or 110t, il dues 
not matter. If you just play, you 
wi ll have a hcalthy dive r~ion from 
~ tudyi ng 25 hours every day. Your 
experiences, good or had, Will he 
interesllng at Ihe very least. 

You can make a day out of it. 
Have a few drink~ before the game 
just to l oo~en up, play, then go 

OPEN 
TO THE 
PUBLIC 

somewhere afterward with your 
team to celebrate your victory or 
drown your defeat. Either way, 
you and your buddies will be 
drunk . I guarantee that night will 
he something to lalk about until 
the next week, when you do it all 
over again. 

Now, let 's talk about panics. I 
know, some people still don't con-
sider whal we do "partying," and 
I've come to grips with that. But 
thai doesn' t mean that you just 
don' t go. Hey, UCSD parties can 
he rea lly funny if you go about 
them in the right way. 

One of Ihe most e~se ntial cle-
ments of attendi ng Ihese panies is 
the pre-party. I can 't s tre~s enough 
how important il is 10 be inebriat-
ed before you gel to your soi ree, 
hecause we all know about Ihe 
shortage of heer al 99 percent of 
UCS D parties. Most panics will 
have fcw peop le, requiring unly 
une or Iwo kegs. The larger pa rti e~ 
Ihal have more keg~ are u ~ua lJ"y 
..:ut down in their prime~ hy some 
uppity police offi cer. So please, 
don'l be sober al a UCSD func-
lion: Remember 10 pre-party. 

Anolher often -forgotten part of 
parties is the game plan. It is cru -
clalto your pany success Ihat you 

The UCSD Guardian 

have a game plan from which you 
do not deviate. While you arc pre-
partying. you and your friends 
mu~t make goab for yourselves. 
Whether it is a cenain numher or 
drinks or an early pa~s-out dead-
line ("I will he passed out by II 
p.m. If nOl , I'll gel your beer for 
the resl of the night. "). just have a 
goal. 

Two perwnal favorites of my 
group or fri ends arc the comer rule 
and Ihe no-g irl rul e. The comer 
rule si mply stales: I will nut get 
out of the corner all night. I am 
going to drink and watch people 
make foo ls of Ihemselves. The no-
gi rl rule i even eas ier: I will not 
talk 10 girls all night long. Friends 
or not, ii's a guys-only night. 
When we follow our goals, we are 
generally much happier with our 

party experience. 
A few more reminders on things 

to do at UCSD. Make sure to have 
a friend who has a habit of falling 
when he drinks. The result are 
unbelievably funny. Also, don 't be 
afraid of Mexico. Lobster Village 
(rips are possibly (be best part of 
li vi ng so close to the border. You 
arc never, never above a raunchy 
TJ trip. Some of the best stories 
come from outh of the border. 

I f you have navigated Ihis far 
through my raving , then you 
probably sec a pattern. Thai i not 
an accident. For those who like 
lists and/or formulas, I will sum-
marize my entire plan. Find open-
minded friends who put fu n ahead 
of scbool. Drink. Play every intra-
mural sport . Drink. Do not negieci 
parties. Drink. Do not join the 
Greek ~yslem . Drink.

San Diego not as 
"spoiled" as L.A. 
ContInued from page U 
wide viewers who tunc in every 
week. On Thursday 's taping, prizes 
included a brand new Mazda Miala 
and $25,000 in cash. So why tape 
in Sal} Diego? 

"( think our Los Angeles crowd 
i a bit spoi led," Sajak said. " It 
gi ves us a chance 10 bring the show 
to San Diegu and the crowd here 
has been tremendous." 

Contrary 10 lbe general percep-
tion_ there's a 101 more 10 Ihis show. 
though, Ihan luming tbe wheel and 
winning prizes. Hundreds of people 
arc nece sary to put tbe show togelh-
er, from a stage hand to Producer 
Harry Friedman to Promoli onal 
DireClor Suzy Rosenberg. 

The process of finding conte -
tants who arc right for the show is 
probably Ihe most grueling aspect of 
all. The people behind the seenes 
sometimes search all over the coun-
try for prospecli ve contestants. For 
instance, a siudent who participaled 
in the second taping new all Ihe way 
here from Indianapolis. 

"We Irave l twice a monlh Ito 
find contestanls]," Rosenberg sa id. 
"It 's a gamble for them because 
Ihey have to pay their way, bUI it 's 
a chance in a lifelime." 

This process began in ea rly 
April as "Wheel of Fortune 's" 
Wheel Mubile. sponsored by NBC 
7/39, made severallrips around San 
Diego County 10 woo contestants. 
" even made a stop here al the 
Library Walk on Tuesday, April tl , 
hoping 10 grab some youthful , 
energetic studen ts. 

The producers of the show 
looked for enthusiastic conlestants 
and seemingly found some at 
UCSD. In fact, 16 were given a 
chance to win slOls on the five 
College Week shows to be taped on 
May I. 

Along with numerous other stu-
dents, I ven tu red to Ihe Hyatt 
Regency HOle I in downtown San 
Diego on April 26 to get a glimpse of 
wbat it (akes 10 be on the "Wheel." 

Inside Ihe Regency Ballroom, 
80 10 90 students gathered in neat 
rows of 10 and began playing mock 
games of the show. As we stood up 
and yelled out letters, consu ltants 
and promotion directors looked for 
charisma and style in each hopeful 
contestant. 

Following these mock games_ 
we were given a quiz (0 test our 
quick thinking, In five minute , I 
was told to solve 16 puzzles, each 
containing a couple of letters to aid 
me in my quest. 

Now il was gelling down 10

For people like Eva

David said It Is a day

experiences" of the 
time she spent in 
Auschwitz, perhaps 
the most notorious 
of the Nazi 
concentration camps.

People must rememher what 
happened and reali/.e "how far

"The I Holu..:ausll was Ihe result 
of hatred," David said. ' 'Talking 

about il will bring people closer 
and [hopefully I prevenl il from

future. 

"People should SlOp for a 
moment and think - whal if I had 
been the one to sutTer'! Whal you

It is al so important to remember 
nol only the Jews who died, hut Ihe 
non-Jews whu "put their li ves un 
the line to help," she said. It is vi tal 
to "honor them for Itheirl enor-
mous risk against enormous evi I," 
Goldstein said. 

UCSD's Union of Jewi sh 
Studenls (UJS) observed Ihe 
Holocaust by reading the names 
and ages of those murdered in the 
cuncentration camps. Though the 
list was read for four hours. not all 

(he names were recited. Rachel 
Powell , co-chair of Ihe JS Israeli 
Action Commillee, said . 

UJ concluded Holocaust 
Remcmbran(;e Day with a speech 
from Holocaust survivor David 
Faber. 

"I Holocaust Remembrance 

DaYI is a timc to reflect on Ihe past 
and rememhcr the mistakes thai 
were made, su Ihat we can look to 
the fulure and keep in mind tbe 
kind of people we want to be." said 
Warren freshman Simona 
lacohovici. 

In an essay entitled "I Am Ihe Water," David writes that 
"Schindler 's List" reminds her of her own experiences: 

Water is a IIwst imporuml source of life. We can survive for a while 
wilhottl eating bUlllot wir/roul drinking waler. 

{learned how essential water is. only when I was deprived of it. In 
tire Concenlration Camps the German soldiers rru:uJe us, the 'prison-
ers, ' stand in line for "Roll call" for /tIony hours. In the /real of the SI4lI, 
ill rain, snow or wind without food or waler; no wonder I fainted fre-
quently. Mdny others died of dehydration. 

Durillg my deportation frolll Hungary to Auschwitz. wh~fI we had 
boarded tire cattle traill, only olle bucket of water was suppli~d for 80 
people! As the trai/l stopped at railroad statiolls we sluck ow ollr hands 
Ihrough the lirrle barbed wired window in the wagoll. We begged for 
waler - but rarely did we get any during Ihe three-day trip_ 

Watching the movie "Schil/dler's Ust " I recogni<.ed the rail-road 
scene wagons looked like t!rose in which we were deponed. Tile waiv-
ing [sic/ arms - what a sight! Watching iI, I relived fhe thirst, hungtr 
and weakness tllall felt when I was in a /raill like thaI, more IIIQII fifty 
years ago. But this group of pri.roners, shown in a movie, was luditr 
- through IMir cattle-wagon:r smull window openings, wale; was

Basketball Stars Made lheir Mark 
SPECTACULAR: In men's hoops, Matt Aune dominated the paint for UCSD, while four seniors led the way for the women 
By Travis Hili 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The freshmen coming into UCSO' s women's 
ba. ketball program next year wi ll be on a team 
that expects to win. The Tri tons havc developed 
into one of the top programs on the Wcst Coast 
anu a perenn ia l playoff t:Olllendcr. Four years 
ago, though, that wa~ not the case, The 
talent was there, but the attitudL!s were 
not; dissension and sL!l li shnes~ ripped 
the team apart. 

Cindy Yama 'uki, Pam Conli ni, Sa· 
mh Schneider and Anne Weslllloreland 
comprised the freshman da,s during 
those darker times, They leamed from 
the ml>take 'of theearlier generalion and 
.:amc to va lue the team above all elsc. 
With their w mmitment and Head oach Judy 
Malone's leadership, Ihe Tritons tU nled th ings 
around. 

In cach season si nce then, UCSD has reachL!d 
newer, greater he ight~ , In the Fah Four' s wpho· 
more season, the Tritons made IhL! (Xlsbeason 
for thc lirst tlmc. They were "ustcd in the lirst 
round, hu t they came back the next season 
hungry for more. 

In their junior campaign, UCSD had it, he~t 
regular sca,on ever and ho~ted It~ ""t·eler 
playoff game. They won il. hut Ihe) played 
timid in the second round against hJp-ranl..ed SI. 
Thomas and losl. 

ANNE 
WESTMORELAND: 
The team's 
leading scorer 
was the kind of 
player who 
wanted the ba ll 
in the cl utc h , 
She was a 
powerful pos t 
playe r who was a great leader on 
a nd off the court. 

SARAH 
SCHNEIDER: 
Asked to 
accept being 
the sixth 
player, 
Schneider's 
unselfish 
attitude 
became the 
team 's, She was the team's top

they could play with any team in the

UCSD wcnt into the postseason

ranking ever. Again, the 
Tritons hosted their lirst-
round contest and agai n 
camc away victorious. The 
second round cont inued to 
he unlucky for the Tritons, 
as they lost to Buena Vista

Matt Aune, arguably the best basketball player 
everat UCSO, will be leavi ng thi s year. There i 
little more to , 1\y lhat hasn' t been aid. 

Aune, the 6' 8" center of 
UCSO's men's squad, will be 
graduating after an immensely 
successful four years in LaJolia. 

Arri vi ng from Santa Rosa 
as a freshman, the hig Illan has 
been all that Triton waches 
could have hoped. ''The Bear," 
as his teammates call him, has 
hcen elu rahle, dedicated amI 

consistent th roughout his career, characteristics 
that. when paired wilh his remarknhle physical 
gift~, arc a guarantee for suece,s. 

Often the tallest, th ickest and strongest man 
on the (;()urt in Di vision III. Aune took it to 
opponents ni ght in and night out to lead the 
Wesh:m Region in scorin g, rebounding and 
lield·goal perccntage thi, season. However, 
Aune is Illore than just the hlggest hully around. 
His under, tundi ng of the gallic ha., i IIlproved 
with each season, and hi ., aSsl, t number, have 
steadily grown. Hc !XJ"esses a soft louch even 
when shooting from a di stancc, while hiS ag-

Continued from page 15 
tons. not afraid of anything. She wa~ Ihe one 
who was willing to sacrifice her body to get 
a loose ball. She always seemed to come up 
with aclulch rehound,orthe steal that ,lopped 
the opposing team 's momentum. 

Contini will not be seen on the Triton ' 
top scorers list, bUI if there was a list for lillie 
things, Contini would be the leader. She left 
cverything on the 110or. 

If Conlini was the heart o f the Triton 
. Iincup. then Sarah Schncider wa~ the soul. 
She excmplified the attitude that IUmcd the 
tide for the Triton program. 

St.:hneider is a greal post player who has 
a sort touch and an uncanny abi lity 10 get 
offensivc reoounds. On the majorityofteams, 

chneiderwould ha ve been a ,tarter. Malone 
thought , though. that St.:hncider's talents 
would be be t used if shecamc ofrlhe hel1(:h 
as the sixth player in her rmation . 

Thai is thc kind of situation that cou ld 
potentially destroy a tearn ' s chemistry. But 
Schneider remembered what had happened 
her freshman year. and grat.:efully accepted 
her role. Not only did she do her job, she 
cxcelled beyond what was expected of her. 

Anne Westmoreland was expecled 10 be 
the top Triton post player this year. and she 
did not disappoint. She dominated the blocks 
all sea,on long and quickly became thego-Io 
player in Malone's o ffense. 

As the scason progressed, she gained 
con lidencc and turned her game up a notch. 
She ended up as the Tritons' Icading scorer. 
and was able to takc over games with her 
energetic play. Her energy was the key to her 
grcat perfonnances. 

Asthese fourgcrns prepare to exit UCSD, 
they wi II lea ve the program in a much diffcr-
elll state than they found it. They havc becn 
the architects of a winning tradition and will 
not soon be forgotten.

Tritons Make One Final Splash 
AQUATICS: Seniors close out a stellar career with a 3rd 
place finish at Nationals and numerous school records 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

After rour trip ' to the DiVI sion 1II Na-
tional Championships, years of practi ces. 
counlless lap. in the pool and ovcr 30 all -
American honors shared among them. three 
graduating scniors who have made a defini -
tive mark on the Triton reco rd books 
were bid a fond farewell by the 
UCSDwomen ' swimminganddiv-
ing team. 

A s rnembers of one of Ihe most 
~ucces ful aquatic programs in the 
nation. the seniors continued a tradi -
lion of excellence that has seen UCSD 
become a mainstay in the top three 
spots at the National Championships. Kristen 
Kemmer and co-captai ns Kri sti Young and 
Heather McPherson took their final plunge at 
thc NCAAs for the Trilons and brought home 
a sizable piece of hardware. 

After qualifying the maximum number of 
swimmers pos ible, UCSD appeared primcd 
to loosen the strangle hold Kenyon College 
held on the first -placc trophy. 

Unfortunately for the Tritons. their besl 
swi mming was not to come in thc Oxford , 
Ohio pool , where they would slip down to the 
third-place spot. While sorne may have con-
sidered the performance a disappointment, it 
cannot mart he impressive record pUltogether 
by the class of 1997. 

A three-year member of the Triton swim 
squad, Kri slcn Kemmer took full advantage 
oCher time in the pool and was able to post the 
six th fastest time in Triton history in the 200-
meter backstroke. 

An NCAA academic all -Ameri can from 
Maryland, Kemmer placed eighth in the 200-
meter backstroke at the National Champion-

ships her j unior year. Kemmer was also a 
member of Ihe Tri lons 200-mcter mcdlcy re-
lay team that posted the second fastest time 
cver at UCSD, 1:47.9. 

" Kri sten i someone who overachieved a 
little bit ," Triton Heall Coach Doug Boyd 

said. "She dropped 10 seconds in hcr 
200 back, she did real wcll and was a 
hard worker." 

Kristi Young wa a leader of the 
UCSD divers, acting as a captain and 
garnering all -Amcrican honors eight 
times during her career. A Palos Verde 
producl. Young placcd 10th in hoth the 
I -mcter and 10-mcterdiving events at 
the National Championships. In Ihe 

same cvent s at l he NCAA's during her junior 
year, Young plac\!d in the tOP eight. 

" Kri sti scored for us every year Ihal she 
was at the NCAAs." Boyd said. 

Rounding out the graduating class is 24-
lime all -Ameri can, Heather M cPherson. A 
member of last ycar' s NCAA champio n 
800- meIer freestyle relay squad, M ePhcrson 
shared captain 's duties and swam a leg on 
the school record-breaking 200 meter free 
relay . McPherson was also an NCAA final -
ist in both the 100-meter and 200-meter 
freestyle . 

" Heather is one of the most decorated 
swirnmcrs that we've had here." Boyd said. 
"Twenty-eight is the maximum number of 
evenls you can swim al the NCAAs and 
Heather earned all -American 24 times in 26 
races." 

A s the Tritons bid farewell to their three 
graduating seniors, it is clear that the class of 
'97 has made quite a splash.
