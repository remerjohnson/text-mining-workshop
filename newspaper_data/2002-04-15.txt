Students· First dominates elections 
Jenn Brown 
will be the next 
A.S. president 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The 2002 A.S. Council elec-
tions concluded Friday with the 
Sttldents First slate winning most 
seats on the counci l after a four-
week campaign that pitted four 
slates against each other and saw 
above-average voter ntrnout. 

Some described the election as 
an upset for the Action and New 
Wave slates, as victories in the 
election came as close as one vote. 

Students First candidate and 
current Vice President Internal 
Jenn Brown was elected A.S. 
Pre ident by a margin wider than 
500 votes. 

"I'm really honored that the 
sntdents ofUCSD saw the passion 
of Students First and the dedica-
tion to our issues," Brown said. 

Kevin Hsu, Dave Ian Beza and 
Steve Klass will be next year's vice 
president internal, vice president 
finance and vice president exter-
nal, respectively. 

Hsu described himself as "nau-
seous" after the results were 
announced. "I think that with as 
many Sttldents First people in 
office as we have, we're really 
going to be able to do what we 
promised," he said. 

Klass said he is excited to be 
vice president external. 

"I'm just really, really glad," he

said. "It's a really important posi-
tion." 

He said he plans to continue 
the fight against UC Regent Ward 
Connerly's Racial Privacy 
Initiative that current Vice 
President External Dylan 
deKervor began last week, as well 
as raise awareness about the 
gubernatorial race next year. 

"It's going to be a beautiful 
year," Klass said. 

The Sntdents First commis-
sioners elected were Brie Finegold 
for student advocacy, Halle 
Beitollahi for academic affairs, 
Navneet Grewal for communica-

tions, David Mitchell for diversity 
affairs and Jeremy Gallagher for 
services and enterprises. 

"I'm overjoyed," Gallagher 
said. "I'm shocked. We worked 
really hard to win, and we're going 
to continue to work really hard in 
the office." 

Independent candidate Robin 
Shelton was elected commissioner 
of athletics and Action slate mem-
ber Gabe Grossman won commis-
sioner of programming. 

Grossman said he hopes for 
programming's best yea r ever, 
despite his slate members ' losses. 

"I've got to represent," he said. 

"I've got to come through with 
everything I said J'd do. I'm gOlllg 
to do it for everyone who should 
have won and didn't." 

The final cabinet position, the 
senate chair, is elected by the sen-
ators when the council takes office. 

The elected senators included 
nine from the Smdents Fir t slate 
and six from Action. 

The Sntdents First senators are

Roosevel t College; Amy Uyeshima

AIMCO, the nation's largest apartment company, is accepting credit 
cards for rent payment, prompting concerns about spiraling debt 
By JESSICA LlNGEL 
Staff Writer 

If it look-. roo good to be true, it probably is, 
or ,0 the saying goes. 

There's J reason we have these age-old say-
Il1g'S m cOlllmon use; they tend to be trUe. 
Exam ples of the aforementioned truism are easy 
to lind: those alIDoying 12-free-CD cards in the 
mail; coupons in the Student Dollar Stretcher 
dl3! advertise a free sandwich (with the purchase 
of two beverages and a sandwich of equal or 
grea ter value). 

The reccnt contract between Apartment 
Investment and Management Company amI Visa 
Corp. could be such an example, only with far 
morc thsturill ng implications 

:-.ica rl v I mill ion tenants now can lise their 
crethr ca~ds to pay rent, thanks to an arrange-
Illent hcrwct.:n Visa and the largest U .S. property 
manager, Chicago-based AJMCO. The program 
has spread to all 337,000 AIMCO units, which 
house tcnants in 46 states. 

Besides haVIng their rent payment automati-
ca lly charged to their credi t card cach month, 
tenants can use their Visa credit or debit cards to 
pay one-time COSts such as security deposits and 
application fees. Renters benefit by avoiding late 
fees, and AIMCO finds its units easier to rent 
because tenants don't have to pay move-in costs 
widl cash. 

These cOllveniences don't out\veigh the neg-
ative impact that further encouraging a depen-
dence on credit cards will create. 

Credit cards were meant to be a form of con-
"t.:nicncc, not an economic crutch allowing peo-
pl ~ to scrape by from paycheck to paycheck, 
while debts and intercst mount menacingly in the 
hackf,'Tound . The idea of habinlally and rcgt.lla rly 
using a credit card to pay for rent is not only 
laughable, it 's di nlrbll1~ 

There are currently 1.4 billion credit cards in 
Circulation . Amcricans aIrcaoy charge three times 
as much as t.hey did 10 years ago - about $1.5 
trillion wa. charged laSt year, compared with

MONDAY, APRIL 15, 2002 

L aura just rolled over, turned to me 
and asked, ''Are you an 
exile?" 

"Of what?" I replied. 
" I d unno," she said, rolling back 

over. 

The difference between Laura 
and me right now is that I'1ll wide 
awake, and she's fa st asleep. Now 
I'm here, trying to figure out what 
the context for that conversation 
should have been. 

Maybe .she's dreaming that thc 
world has inverted its land and it~ 
oceans, and the Pacific and Atbnric 
are in a huge war, struggling for 
imperialistic control of the Baltic, 
where there 's a shitload of oil. She's 
a member of the peacekeeping 
forces for the Pacific in the Baltlc, 
the native inhabitants of the Baltic 
having been forced out of their own 
lands by the tyrannical Atblllic. 
She passes one such person and 
asks, "Are you an exile)" 

Maybe she's dreaming that she 's 
playing 20 questions, and she's get-
ting near the cnd. She pictures her-
self si tting on one of four bunk beds 
in the stereotypical college dorm, 
and they've just changed the topic 
from "Where do we go after we 
die?" to 20 questions. She's on No. 
18 and running out of questions, 
narrowing in or blindly guessing. 

Maybe she's mstdr ·a Super 
Mario Bros. game, and Bowser has 
just transformed the king into a 
turtle, littered the place with 
Koopas, and banished Yoshi and his 
friends from the land . She loob 
above, and sees a perfect I-by-l-
by-I cube with a flashing question 
mark on it. She jumps, hitting it 
with her fist, and out pops a Yoshi, 
who looks very si milar to his 
friends. Before mounting it, she 
asks, "Arc you an ·exile'" 

Maybe she is just fucking with 
me. 

It was sometime this week that I 
decided to start sleeping at 5 a.m. 
Well , I didn't teally decide; some-
times you're just sitting there, and 
5 a.m. rolls around, and you say to 
yourself, "Self, it's time to hit the 
sack." And you sta nd next to the 
edge of your bed and lose your bal-
ance on purpose, slamming face-
first into a pillow. At first you 
entertain the idea of brushing your 
teeth, putting on pajamas, but that 
fl eeting thought leaves, and YOII 
can feel yourself slippin g awa),. 

It's on rare occasions like this 
that you can differentiate betwcen 
being awake, entering a dream, and 
being in a dream. For me, I imagine 
it to be a little vortex, like Dorothy 
in "The Wizard of Oz" spinning 
down further and further. (I'd like 
to stress the point that I don 't often 
identify with Dorothy in "The 
Wizard of Oz," unless Dorothy is 
listening to Pink Floyd and most of 
the things she does happen to cor-
respond to their music in a music 
video sort of way, and even then its 
an occasional thing.) 

The spinning and the whole 
tornado bit is not metaphorical; I 
actually picture it in my mind, and 
when I hit the bottom, I'm in a 
dream, .which is when most people 
try to imagine girls they'd like to 
have sex with. 

I once took some prescription 
sleeping pills, and it was ahom the 
same. Except before it even started, 
with my eyes sti ll open, I could fcel 
every muscle in my body rela~illg 
and melting into the bed . I felt

'Racism' not limited to The Koala 
Voz Fronteriza articles use offensive slurs 

By CHRIS TAYLOR 
Contributing Writer 

The .macks on Tbe Koala fur its 
use of raCist humor have faded by 
now into our memory like fall 
quarter's grades. But one thing is 
still true : Racism is definitely still 
prevalent at UCSD and in its pub-
lications. 

I Ioweve r, T'lu KOllla - the 
mo~t recent scapegoa t .- has a far 
smaller ro le than most people 
think. In fact, the role Tbe Koalll 
plays actually serves to reveal a 
great doub le standard behind 
which the rrue racism hides.The 
real hypocrisy that saturates the 
campus is the selective attacks on 
free speech by groups that are 
often, arguably, more racist than 
Tbr KOllla . 

For too long, racism has not 
been well-defined, even though 
"racism" is a si mple term. Racism 
is the judgment of individ ual s 
hased solely on the color of their 
skin, an att'ribute over which they 
hdve no control. \Vhen someone 
makes claims that blanket all peo-
ple of a skin color, they are racist 
because they hold each individual 
accountable for their perverted 
view of the whole race , no matter 
how fa r removed from the gener-
alization that individual is. 

Racism is a seri ous accusation 
that is all too often flung around 
lightly. The problem presents 
itself when people begin accusing 
each other of racism while believ-
ing that they are impervious to 
racism themsel ves. 

Often, one organization will 
accuse other organizations of 
racism , not knowing th at their 

own stance is as cllually racist as 
the one they're attacking. If 
everyone cries "hate speech " 
because they disagrce with one 
anothe r, then freedom of speech 
means virtually nothing. 

The best current example is 
the Voz Fro"te"iw, an A.S. 
Council-funded Spanish- and 
English-language publication 
centered on the reacquisi tion of 
the entire Southwestern United 
States for Mexico. This publica-
tion is probably the most outspo-
ken of the groups that cry racism 
at the slightest provocation. In 
fact, despite its own speech 
agai nst white people, it condemns 
Tbr KOIIIII for racism. 

While st udent organizations 
and college councils attack Tbe 
KOIlIIl for its racist jokes, the Voz 
Fro1lferizll sa turates its articles 
with words such as "gringo" and 
"gabacho," which are offensive to 
many white srudents. They also 
call Chicanos who have assimilat-
ed into American culture "pigs" 
and "traitors." 

Tlu KOIlIIl makes jokes in poor 
taste, whereas the Voz ac tually 
intends the offense. In fact, one 
article in the Voz, from 1995, 
praised the death of a Spanish-
surnamed Immigration and 
Naturalization Service worker, 
sta ting, "We're glad this pig died . 
He deserved to die." 

The Voz Fro1/teriza "Veb site 
refers to the imperialism of 
Europeans by emphasizing only 
th ose of strict Anglo-Saxon 
descent. Irs authors point out that 
they are proud when they obtain 
"resistance against European 
(white) colonialism/imperialism." 

In their rants against the "white 
Europeans," they seem to forget 
that the Spanish conquistadors 
were as much to blame as were the 
other European colonists. 

Though I strongly believe that 
the Voz has the right to print its 
material, I find it unsettli ng that it 
quickly cries racism without 
examining itself. However, it is 
alarming that the Voz Fronw'izlJ, 
in its most recent issue, explicitly 
attacked Tbe Koairl for hate 
speech. "The real point is how 
easy it is for Tbe KoallJ to talk shit 
and not be afraid of the conse-
quences," an article sta ted . Afraid 
of what conseq uences~ Tbe Koala 
has the right to say these things. 
So does the Voz FromerizlJ. So do 
all the publications . The VOZ 
reveals its hypocrisy in implyi ng 
that it should have the right to 
insult certain ethnicities as much 
as it wishes, but The KUlJla should 
not be able to print without fear of 
consequences. Should one publi-
cation be left out of free speech 
because another publication docs 
not like what it has to say? If that 
were the case, '[be NtW Indicll tor 
anc.l Tht Califon/ia Review would 
have destroyed each other years 
ago. 

T his is the double standard in 
which we have saturated our-
selves: one group after another 
accusing the other of " hate 
speech" merely because it does 
not like what the other group has 
to say. This is real hypocrisy, and 
this is where the real racism 
reveals itself. The Voz Fronuriza is 
arguably racist toward white peo-

pie. h s writers may even think 
that white people deserve it. That, 
unfortunately, is not the real issue 
at hand. The more serious prob-
lem is that it condemns Tht Koala 
for the exact same vice. 

[n the end, there are two prob-
lems. The first problem is that 
racis m still exis ts, but often in 
forms very different from the typ-
ical white su premacist babble. 
The second probl em is the 
hypocrisy that we face when we 
feel the power to accuse someone 
of raci sm without first examining 
ourselves. It is this hypocrisy that 
leads people to look for racism 
everywh ere, ami it is this 
hypocrisy that leads people to 
think they are the only ones who 
are not racist. 

The solution is not an easy 
one. To rid our lives of racism is a 
gradual process and one that 
requires a great deal of education. 
h would be best to stop singling 
out certain groups as the only 
"racist" ones among us. 

In the end , it is not for me to 
decide whether it is Tbt Koala or 
the I1Iz that is racist without care-
fully checking my own thoughts 
first. What we can easily fix is the 
remarkable number of times pub· 
lications cry racis m because they 
have not thought through their 
own stances thoroughly enough. 

T he next time a publication 
wishes to decree someone racis t 
- whether it be another group, 
publication or A.S. Council slate 
- it shou ld consi der first whether 
it is not truly being raci st itself. 
Perhaps then we could begin to 
eliminate real racism at this uni-
versity.

myself sink further and further 
into it, much like that scene in 
"Trainspotting." Then the spin-
ning began. 

It was a lot more difficult to 
reverse the process. I dreamt I 
woke up, got up, took a hower, 
brushed my teeth, and then real -
ized it was still a dream, so then I 
really woke up, got up, took a 
shower, brushed my teeth, and 
then realized it was srill a dream, 
so then I rea lly woke up, got up, 
took a shower, brushed my teeth, 
and then got relllly pissed because 
it was still a dream. I went through 
one more level of dream world 
before I finally woke up, and I 
really didn't want to take a shower 
or brush my teeth after that. 

Laura just mumbled, "Sez 
Yahoo." Great. My girlfriend's a 
fucking nerd in her dreams. In 
her dreams, she sits in front of a 
computer screen and plays 
Counterstrike with a guy 200 feet 
away. They couldn't talk, because 
that would be too difficult and too 
much to think about. 

If they were forced to talk, 
they'd talk about their majors, ask 
which college they were each a part 
of, discuss how boring UCSD is 
and how theres nothing to do, 
comment briefly on the parking 
situation, talk about how elections 
are worthless, voting is worthless, 
and it's just a big popularity contest

high school just didn't understand

Across the ca 

By SARAH HASSAINE 
Staff Writer 

For some news watchers, it may 
~celll :I> though the po t-Sept. II 
world I> spiraling int a new era of 
conflict, with the II I , t Intense strife 
concentrated in the ,\ l idd le East. 

The hcightelll g tension 
between the Israe lis and 
Palcstinians is leaving the world 
puzzled th<lt such an escalation of 
VIOlence IS occurring with no reso-
lutIOn in sight. Both sides are suf-
fe ring, living in fear of what tomor-
row will bring. 

While Israelis fear sudden 
attacks from suicide bombers, 
Palestinians face the risk of their 
homes being invaded, frequent 
checkpoin ts, in IIddition to curfews 
and the lack of electricity and 
water. The images of blood, guns, 
destruction, death, tcars and 
despair fl ood television screens and 
newspapers everywhere. 

Though many students get 
wrapped up in the university life of 
studying and waiting for those 
Friday night parties, there are stu-
dents a[ UCSD who are greatly 
affected by and pay great attention 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

to the crisis in the Middle East: the 
Palestinian and Jewish populations 
on campus. 

Both groups say they are going 
through a difficult period and find 
themselves witnessing history that 
hits home for many of them. 

Muir junior Joseline IIian's 
Palestinian family lives in 
Bethlehem. She said he finds her 
daily activities interrupted by her 
constant concern for them. 

"I am not giving any attention 
to my assignments at all," she said . 
"I am always glued to the Tv. 

"It has been 50 overwhelming 

MONDAY, APRIL 15,2002 

he worl 

lately. My parents are always calling 
my relatives. We found out that my 
cousin's mother and brother-in-
laws were buried alive and now we 
just learned tllat there are tanks 
outside of my family'S home;and 
they are all confined to their living 
room. They cannot leave." 

flian, who also said she feels 
"humiliation" as a Palestinian, con-
cluded by saying, "It's been real 
hard." . 

Warren junior Uthman Salah, a 
Palestinian who used to live in 
Bethlehem, said all his cousins have 
been arrested. 

"My only remarnrng family 
right now are the elderly, like my 
grandparents," he said. 

Jewish student Josh Shupack, a 
Revelle College sophomore, 
described how the conflict has afTect-
ed him at a very "personal level." 

"I spent nine months in Israel 
last year," Shupack sai d. "Four 
[months] out of the nine, [lived a't 
a kibbutz, a social communal. I just 
learned that someone r had met 
there was recently killed in a sui-
cide bombing."

Israel: 
Condemnation and 
sympathy expressed 
Continued from page 10 

Shupack added that it has been 
an exrremely hard time for him. 

" It is difficult understanding 
why this is all happening," he said. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior David Weisberg, president of 
the Union of Jewish Students, said 
that all his friends either know some-
onc living in the Middle East or 
know of someone who knows some-
one li ving there. 

Weisberg's aunt lives in 
Jerusalem with her family of six 
children. 

.. eldom does a moment go by 
where they are not on my mind," 
he said. 

Pal estinian graduate student 
. \J,IJ E1Jlxld said lhat he is "very 
much distracted ." 

" I will spend seven to eight 
hours in front of the T V and maybe 
two hOll rs to stu Iy," Elabad said, 
adding that he is worried for his 
family, who , he aid, is "managing" 
right now. 

John Muir College senior Noah 
Levin, a Jewish student, believes 
that the Middle East conflict could 
escalate into World War Ill. 

"I keep heari ng of fri ends who 
arc losing family and friends in 
Israel. It is just ballooning out of 
control," he said . 

Levin call ed the experience 
"terrible." 

The c(Jnflicr in the Middl e East 
stems fro m a ncient disagreements 
and ha rreds . This is reflected in the 
opinions of some UCSD students , 
which can be hostile to the oppos-
ing side. 

Becka Andrews, a Marshall 
sophomore who is Jewish, said her 
"heart rcaches out to those killed 
by suicide bombers." When pre-
se nted with the statistics of the 

deaths of the Palestinians in Israeli 
incursions, she said she feels "no 
sympathy for them." 

She explained that the victims of 
suicide bombers, were killed "not 
by choice," whereas Palestinians 
"disrupt security" and heighten 
tension. 

The Palestinians, however, 
argue that they are an oppressed 
people. 

"The whole Palestinian infra-
structure has been devastated 
because the Israelis are trying to 
erase our history," Ilian said. She 
added tha t the suicide bombers are 
"people that are willing to die for 
their country and are not attached 
to life as much ." 

Salah added that under interna-
tional law, the Israelis have broken 
every resolution and denied human 
rights to the Palestinians. 

Yct despite the different view-
points on the crisis in the Middle 
East, some nonetheless have sym -
pathy for both sides. Even though 
both groups stand by their own 
claim and perspective, some 
address the human side of such a 
poli tical situation. 

Weisberg sa id of the deaths of 
the Palestinians, "[It} completely 
tears me up ." 

He added, "It doesn't matter 
what side; what matters is that peo-
ple arc dying." 

Shu pack said that for both sides, 
" It is difficult to watch, and difficult 
to read." 

Salah admitted that he disagrecs 
with the Pales tinian attacks on the 
I raeli popubtion, sayi ng, "They 
should not be purposefull y target-
ing civilians. That is not right." 

While on the world scene, hos-
tili ties between Israeli s and 
Palcstillians are at an all-time high, 
many students at UCSD have yet 
to sense unease between Jewish and 
Palestinian individuals or groups 
on campus.

Palestine: 
Issue has provoked 
on-campus conflict 
Continued from page 11 

LC\,1I1 ~Jid he feels no tensIon at 
~1I \\Ilh Palestinian students. 
Eleanor Ruosc,e1 t College fresh-
man ' [imya Dughman said she feels 
no hate a~ a Palestinian on campus. 

The\' C;1Il be friends with one 
anothc~ and get along just fine 
when reiating to each other, 
'vVelsberg said, "as students want-
ing good grades and going 
through co llege." 

Roosevelt sophomore Manal 
Hafez, a Palestinian student, said 
one of her good friends is] ewish. 
But in these relationships, stu-
dents have noted, any mention of 
Middle East poli tics can ruin the 
friendly atmosphere. 

"We have to keep politi cs out 
of it," Hafez said. 

But for some, politics or no 
pol itics, they refuse ro associate 
wi dl one another. 

Ilian said that she avoids 
JewIsh tudents and does not want 
ro talk to them. 

" I know this may sound 
biased, but I automatically classify 
them," [Iian said. "It is because of 
them that I can never go back to 
my homeland." 

Shupack said he has no 
Palestinian friends becau e the 
"opportunity never came up, " and 
he i; not sure if it ever will, given 
such grave political differences. 

\Vhcn it comes to turning 
fceitngs of helplessness into 
action, both Palestinian and 
Jewish students are experienced at 
keeping busy. 

In the past, U]S, the Muslim 
StLldellt .\ ssociation and the Arab 
StlIdcllt Union have had informa-
tion tables on Library \Valk in 
order to raise awarencs, to other 

students and present many per-
spectives on the conflict. There 
have been rallies in the Price 
Center and awareness weeks by 
both the MSA and the U]S. 

Last year, the NISA hostcd 
Anti-Zionism \;\/cck, a week 
lI1eanr to "expdnd the under-
standing of Ziolllsm by bringing 
up awareness of oppression," 
according to MSA president and 
Marshall senior Ahmed Salem. 

"It has nothing to do with reli-
gion or with ethnicity," Salem 
said. "'vVe respect the Jews. It was 
suicdy political." 

Despite respectful intentions, 
the week was characterized by 
anger and arguments raised on 
campus between the two groups. 
Jew ish students immediately 
responded with information 
tables, and UCSD adminisuation 
tried to intervene to calm the sit-
uation. Andrews said that during 
chat week she fe lt targeted. 

According to Salem, both 
groups managed to create SOIllC 
dialogue in A.S. Council meet-
ings, but other than arguing on 
Library 'vValk, nothing formal was 
ever done to reconcil tensions. 

Last week, both student 
groups brought guest speakers in 
order to learn more about the sit-
uation in Israel and Palestine. 
And both are preparing to have 
information tables on Library 
Walk within the next few weeks. 

Levin said that these days, 
UCSD students tend to "be more 
informational when it comes to 
political .differences than con-
frontational. " 

Of course, when dIe organiza-
tions have tables om, it is COIll-
mon for students to get into polit-
ical debates with one another, but 
Andrews said, "\-\le approach 
them so we can see what they are 
saying and learn."

Critical gend~r studies 
is nothing to scoff at 

FEATURES 13 

Some mock major and feminism in general 
without understanding important issues 
By UNDSAY BOYD 
Associate Features Editor 

When I tell people I'm going to 
college, I am met with the ques-
tion (and I'm sure most students 
can relate) - "So, what's your 
major'" 

As much as 1 dread this ques-
tion, I know it's coming whenever I 
sit down next to a relative or strike 
up a conversation with a new 
acquaintance. However, I don't 
dread this question for the reason 
you may think. 

Unlike those who struggle to 
decide what they are doing in col-
lege, I know what I want to study; 
I've decided, I've declared. VVhen I 
say, "Actllally, I'm a critical gender 
studies major" it is I ike opening 
Pandora's box. 

There are those who don't 
know what critical gender stlldics 
is. To them, I explain that it IIsed 
to be ca lled women 's studies but 
that title was somcwhat erroneous 
because the em phasis of study is 
on taking a critical look at gender, 
rathe r than celebrating women. 

There are those who are 
shocked that there actually is such 
a major. "There's actllally a class in 

fell1ini~t theory'" they ask. 10 
them, I explain that there are a 
number of classes on feminist the-
ory in several different depart-
ments, as wcll as classes on gender 

THE TABLES, 
THE CHALK, 

in art, literature, mllsic and sci-
ence. 

But the response that I despise, 
the one that makes me seethe wi th 
anger, is the reaction that I was met 
with by an Earl Warren College 
student who shall remain nameless. 

"That's awful," he said. "I won't 
hold that against you." 

While ['m sure, to him, invali-
dating my whole purpose in college 
was all in good fun , I thought it was 
ignorant and just disrespectful. He 
was an engineering major. 
Engineering is a field r find com-
pletely and utterly boring. 
However, I know it is a hard field 
that requires dIe time and dedica-
tion of those who don't find it a 
yawner. So, I graciously fake my 
interest, put on a contrived inquisi-
tive look - I would never tell 
someone their major is "awful." 

If you thiltk I'm overreacting, 
you're wrong. I'm not an overly 
sensitive person, but some things 
go too far. \Nhen you insult my 
major, you are insulting more than 
rhe classes I take, and the work I 
do. You are insulting my cntire ide-
ology. 

I am a feminist. I know 10 some 
people feminism is the other f-
word, but I embrace feminism 
de pite the social baggage It brings. 
I've never burned my bra or shaved 
my head and I'm not a proponent 
of all-female communes. 

Howcver, if challenging" ,OCI-
ety where women cam 73 percen t 
of what men earn offends you, I'm 
not sorry. If studying the gcnder 
constructions that oppress men and 
women bothers you, I don't apolo-
gize. 

I chose my major because dur-
ing my entire four years of hIgh 
school English, I never read a sin-
gle novel by a femalc authur. To 
me, this lack of perspective was not 
only wrong, but boring. vVith the 
exception of Lewis Carroll's Alice, I 
don't think many mcn write n()vel~ 
with female protagonists. It'!. only 
natural- authors write about \Vh.It 
they know, and its a hard, hard 
thing to step out of your own shoes. 
I don't blame Dickens for creating 
the neurotic, psychotIC Miss 
Havisham and the evil Estella, I Just 
wish I could have conu'astcd her 
with Jane Eyre or Emma. 

I don't think the lack of female 
voices was a malicious effort on the 
part of my teachers. Yct that's wh.lt 
is so interesting about gender to 
me. I low, on a subconscious levd, 
we can acccpt the abscnce of an 
entire half of thc population. I low 
all my English teachers looked .It 
their curriculum, and didn't blInk 
an eye when all they saw were 
Dickens, Joycc or Ibsen; how th e

Soapbox: 
Achieving equality for 
women takes study 
Continued from page 13 

Alice Walker were simply left out. 
I felt then, as I do now, that my 

experience in high school English 
w~s more than just my personal dis-
appointment in never reading 
"Emma." To me it seemed obvious 
that 30 years after the women's 
movement, it was still important to 
snldy gender, because some things 
arc still not right. To borrow a 
phrase from the women's movement, 
the personal is indeed political. 

So, the next time you get on 
your engi neering high horse and 
knock my major, think about what 
t:xactly you're criticizing. That men 
and women can be equa l parmers' 
That Jane Austen should be taught 
alongside Charles Dickens? I hope, 
and don't mink that :my students at 
this school would ever say men are 
superior to women. What they 
Jon't realize is that it takes analyses 
and stud}'ing to break through the 
glass ceiling, 

And if you are onc of those peo-
ple who think feminism is the f-
word, I have another f-word for 
you. 

Conflid: 
Students pessimistic on 
possibility of peace 
Continued from page II 

SOllle Palestinian students feci 
the same way, For example, Elabad 
ma de ita poi nt to go to the Israel 
table during UJS's Awareness Week 
last quarrer and see what they had 
on Ji,play and share his opinions, 
and the story of his family's history 
there. 

Hafez said educa ting others 
through rallies and information 
tables is very important. 

" It is so easy to feel over-
whelmed, and coming together for 
this purpose makes 111(' proud to be 
a Palestinian," Hafez said. " I al11 
more proud now than cvcr, because 
of this sense of nationalism." 

Despite the current apparent 
peact! between Jewish and 
r ,de'linian students, UCSO's 
Student Office of ]-luman Relations 
IS preparing to react to any possible 
tension in a proactive way, 

Elizabeth Urtecho, the director of 
SOl JR, hopes to start group discus-
sions or forwns that would be medi-
:lIcd hy experts. This way, shc hopes 
to provide a place where students can 
discliss their opinions and frustra-
tions in a constructive lIlanner. 

Individually, many students feel 
Lhat a dialogue would be great idea, 
but say they think others would be 
reluctant to take part. 

"Everyone is set on their views," 
Dughman said. "Wc'llnever accept 
their claim, just like they will never 
accept ours." 

Simi larly, Weisberg said that 
people he knows usually leave these 
foruills "with a bad taste in their 
mOllth." 

He said, however, "It can't hurt, 
because I think we should work on 
bringing our communities together 
to elliphasize what we have in com-
mOil. It's tOugh because both sides 
have so much to say."

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

WHY RENT? BUY! 
"As a 3rd year student at UCSD J wanted to live off campus and have a 
place that I could go home to and feel comfortable in. J gave Tobin a call 
after J saw his ad in the GUARDIAN and because I was familiar with him 
after living in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am doing. He has been a tremendous help and I 
hope when I'm ready to buy property later in life I will have a real esta te 
agent who has been as wonderful as Tobin! Calling Tobin is a no-brainer 
if you are looking for a place to live."

The UC SD mcn's volleyball 
tea m cnded i t~ scason by beating 

a ti ona l Association of 
[nte rcollcgiale Athletes nonconfer-
cnce o pponent California Baptist 
University 3-0 on Samrd ay. The 
lritons also dropped their second-
straight 0-3 decision to fo.urth-
ra nkcd Brigham Young University 
last W edncsday. 

During the second leg of the 
two-g ame series, the Tritons 
strugglcd wil h errors, fi nishing 
with an overall hitting percentage 
of . 152 while Brigham Young hit 
.344. 

The first sc t aga inst the Cougars 
saw the Tri tons battle back and 
fo rth with BYU during the wholc 
sct, with no tea m gaining more 
than a four-point lead. 

After taking a 17- 15 lead , the 
Tritons let the Cougars back in thc 
game, commirting four errors and 
giving BYU a 25 -21 advantage. 

From there the Tritons, led by 
Jim Waller and Eric Perrine, 
clawed their way back to a 27 -27 
tie, however, a kill by Jaime Mayol 

finished offUCSD 30-28. 
The 13 ties in the next game 

demonstrated the even play from 
both teams. However once again 
UCSD fell late in the game, and 
three errors and a BYU kill 
snapped a 17-17 tie and helped the 
Cougars to pull away for the 30-25 
victory. 

,ame three saw the lritons 
grab thc lead until the Cougars 
came back to tie the game at 13 . 

The two teams traded one-point 
leads until the Cougars finall y 
pulled away into a 21 - 19 lead . 
From there it was all EYU, who 
reeled off four consecutive points 
to win the set 30-24 and the game 
3-0. 

Perrine posted a team-high 11 
kills in the losing effort, while set-
ter Jordan Have contributed 37 
assists. 

In Saturday's season finale, the 
Tritons hosted Cal Baptist in an 
attempt to end their season on a 
winning note. 

Played in front of 378 fans on 
Senior Night, game one was 
extremely close, with the two 
teams ba ttling to 19 ties in the 
first set.

Chico State's pitching 
Continued from page 20 

dinger of the year, in the top of the 
eighth to clinch the Wildcats' victo-
ry. Right fielder Brad Walski, desig-
nated hiner Rusty Kawachi and 
catcher Kurt Probasco each had two 
hilS in the first Saturday game. 

Behind his team's 12 hits, Wildcat 
senior pitcher David Goni went 
eight innings and improves to 4-0 
with the 8- 3 win. 

Follmving this nine-irll1ing match 
up, the Wildcats and Tritons battled 
for a third time in a scheduled seven-
inning game. 

UCSD's woes continued as it put 
up a goose egg in the runs column of 
the second game of the afternoon. 

Triton starter Alex Cremidan, 
only going three and one-third 
innings and allowing five runs on five 
hits, picks up his second loss of the 
season and is now 6-2 . Raf 

However, after their last tie at 
25 apiece, the Tritons used kills by 
Perrine, Waller and Have to earn 
the 30-27 first-set win. 

[n the second game the T ri tons 
took care of busi ness earl y, scor ing 
six straight points to jump ahead 
10-4 after an initial 4-4 tie. 

From there UCSD cru ised to a 
30-24 win , hirting .297 as a team in 
the second set. 

UCSD dupl icated the sa me hit-
ting percentage in the third se t, rel-
ative to the JJ9 1 percentage of Ca l 
Baptist. 

In the third game, UC . D agai n 
was too much fo r Cal Baptist. 
Afte r a 11 - 11 ti e, thc T ritons capi-
talized on errors by CBU alit! a 
couple Wall er kills to jump to a 
21-14 lead . 

However, Cal Baptist went on a 
8- 1 run and came back 10 forge a 
22-22 tie. 

From there Waller posted four 
kills and Perrine posted two ro 
assure the 'Iritons of victory. 

With the nonconference win , 
the Tritons finish the season 7-23 
overall, 1-21 in conference, which 
improved upon their 6-2 1 (0-1 7 in 
conference) fini sh the year before. 

Bergstrom and Andy Holloway also 
pitched in the loss. 

The Wildcats scored in the clUrd , 
fourth and seventh innings of the 
game including four runs in the 
fourth after twO leadoff walks and an 
error to shut out UCSD al home. 

Starting second baseman 
Merrifield coiltinued to have an out-
standing day for the sluggish ' tritons, 
going two-for-two in the second game. 

Poor base running and multiple 
errors proved fatal for UCSD . 
Wildcat second baseman Poole went 
three for four, while teammates 
Walski and cen ter fi elder C hris 
Henry had two hits each . 

Chico staner Brian Thomas 
threw a six-hit shutout in the seven-
inning nightcap to give the second-
ranked Wildcats the sweep. 

The Wildcats increase their lead 
in the CCAA standings to 22 -5. 

UCSD dropped back into third 
place ar 18-13 in the CCAA, 23- 18-1 
overall. The Tritons will attempt to 
begin a new winning streak when 
they face Cal State Stanislaus in a 
four-game road trip next weekend. 

" \ \ 'e 're real ly startin g to

Softball split portends clouds 
Triton softball finds itself looking to win out 
BY BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD softball team split 
doubleheaders with Division r 
University of San Diego and 
California Collegiate Ath letic 
Association opponent Cal State 
Stanislaus last week, with the 
resui ts yielding both disappoint-
ment and hope for the future. 

The Toreros of USD came to 
Triton Softball Stadium on Apri l 
10 followed by unimpressive statis-
tics. The Toreros' record was 8-30 
coming into play, as they had hit 
only .196 for the season and had a 
15-game losing streak . The Tritons 
allowed USD to break that losing 
streak in the first game, but 
promptly started them on their 
ne.xt one. 

In the opener, UCSD's Leea 
Harlan. and USD's Anna Russell 
locked into a pitchers' duel with 
each hurler shutting down oppos-
ing batters with ease. The game's 
only scoring came in the top of the 
fourth inning when USD's Lora 
McBay launched a home run to 
right center field to give the 
Toreros all the offcnse they woul d 
need for the 1-0 \~CtOry. Russell 
scattered six hits over seven innings 
and the Tritons left eight runners 
on base, as an inability to get time-
ly hi ts cost the lritons. 
. "We hit in the first game," said 
UCSD head coach Pani Gerckens. 
"But we didn 't get clutch hits." 

The second match appeared to 
have more of the same in store, as 
the game went scoreless through 
the fOp of the third inning. 
Ilowever, the bonom of the third 
yielded a six-run rally for the 
Tritons, which broke the game 
open . 

Mieko McCue opened the 
inning with a walk and Kim 
Aggabao followed by being hit by a 
pitch for the thi rd time that day. 
Amy Mcnee loaded the bases when 
she heat out a hunt and Kristina 
Anderson struck the key blow with 
a bases-clearing triple. Harlan had 
a two-run single, and Michell e 
Leisen added an RBI double later 

$20,000 

in the inning to help the Tritons 
take control of the game. 

UCSD would come back to 
score two more runs in the fourth 
inning, but pitcher Keri Hanley 
would need no such help as she 
threw a brillian t one-hit shutout 
for the 8-0 victory. 

"Keri Hanley pitched a phe-
nomenal game," Greckens said . 
"Keri's been pi tching real well in 
practice. We'd like (Q use Keri as 
m uch as we can, and she had a 
great outing, which is exciting for 
us." 

Hanley agreed that pitching in 
batting practice helped her. 

"I think [ was ready," Hanley 
said . "I clUnk now that I've been 
through more batting practice, 
there's more confidence." 

UCSD had reason to be confi-
dent going into Saturday'S double-
header with Cal State Stanislaus 
after sweeping the Warriors at 
home earlier in the season, but 
Stanislaus pitcher Rachelle 
Verhoeven wasn't about to give 
these games away. 

Verhoeven, a freshman, was a 
'stingy host to the visiting Tritons 
while combining witll Lisa Spencer 
10 throw a six-hit shutout in the 
first game of the series. Warriors 
Jamie Harkins and Kim Thurman 
paced Stanislaus at the plate with 
multiple RBI days en route to a 6-0 
victory. 

Despite the rough start, UCSD 
looked to show its resilience in the 
nightcap with Hanley back on the 
mound. The Tritons quickly 
regained their offensive form with 
four runs in the top of the first 
inning. UCSD went on to score II 
runs and cruised to a five-inning, 
I I-I victory. 

Hanley went four innings in her 
second-straight strong start before 
yielding to Christi Martinelli in the 
fifth, allowing only one run. 
Despite the Warriors' nine hits on 
the day, the Tritons did not hun 
themselves with mistakes, commit-
ting only a single error - their first 
in four games. 

"Defense is a huge factor 
because all the teams we play have 
good hitters, so it's really impor-
tant," Anderson said. 

Anderson continued her hot 
h itting, going 3-for-3 and driving 
in a run, while Harlan was also 
perfect, going 2-for-2 with four 
RBIs. 

The big win helped to salvage 
the series and marked the second 
consecutive victory for Hanley. 

As the Tritons head into tlleir 
final home games of the season, on 
April 19 and 20 against Cal State 
Bakersfield and Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, they look to put 
a winning streak together and con-
tinue to get solid performances 
from their future stars.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL IS , 2002 

Baseball fails test against first-place Chico 
UCSD loses first series of the year, drops to third place 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

Coming off a 4-1 loss against 
nonconference foe Point Lama 
Un iversity on \Vednesday, the 
UCSD baseba ll team returned 
home this weekend to face 
California Coll egiate Athletic 
As ociation conference leader 
C hico State University. . 

The Tritons tried hard Friday 
night against the Wildcats with 
seven innings of five-hit ball from 
lriton senior hurler Keith Smith. 
However, it was to no avail, as 
UCSD lost 5-3 . 

The "Iritons also began a dis-
turbing trend Friday, hitting six 
\Vildcat batters with pitches in the 
first game of the series. 

Chico State second baseman 
Robby Poole was hit three times 
and scored two runs. Wildcat desig-
nated hitter John Moylan drove in 
two runs, and fi rst baseman Jimmy 
Linn went twO for three on the day. 

Sam Scoufos/CuQrdian Wildcat senior pitcher Adam 
Montarbo pitched five and tll'O-
thirds innings and improved to 7-
I, while closer Clark Johnson 
picked up hi fir~t save of the year. 

Solid contact: Keith Albrecht connects last weekend against Chico State University. The Tritons dropped the fi rst three 
games of the series to the Wildcats, subsequently dropping out of second place into third place. 

The oudielder did most of the 
hitting for UCSD: T hey had five 
out of the nine Triton hit in the 
game. Outt'ielders John Bologna 
and Matt Smith each had two hits 
in the loss, while right fielder 
David Hawk blasted a solo home 
run , his fourth of the year. 

Despite the appa rent offensive 
success, the Wi ldcats' three runs in 

the fifth proved to be roo much to 
overcome. 

Saturday's noon doubleheader 
did not prove much better for the 
Tritons. 

Chico began the first game just 
where they had left off the previ-
ous night. They scored five nms in 
the first three innings of the game, 
including a three-run , four-hit 
rally in the top of the second. 

Triton starter Andy Ha nau 
pitched seven innings, surrender-
ing five runs, 10 hits and two hit 
batters. Hanau falls to 3-3 with 
the loss. Bologna had two si ngles 
while designated hitter Jeff 
Riddle notched a single and a 
double in the second loss to the 
Wildcats. 

The Tritons tried to rally in the 
eighth as pinch hitter Matt 

Merrifield knocked a shot to Icft-
center field. Thi initial kick was 
useless as the following Triton bat-
ter grounded out to end the 
inning. 

Chico State left fielder Steve 
Newson put on a hitting clinic, 
going three for five. Newson hit a 
three-run home run , his fifth

Tritons enjoy home after two months on the road 
W omen's track and field finishes first, men place second over weekend 
By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD track and field wel -
comed itself back home with an 
impressive performance at the 
U CSD Collegiate Invitational at 
the Track and Field Stadium on 
Saturday, ending two months of 
competition on the road. 

Both the women 's and men's 

teams gained momentum head-
ing into the final stretch of the 
season, with the women winning 
the team title and the men nar-
rowly finishing second behind 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

"We're very pleasantly ' sur-
prised but we competed real 
tough," said head coach Tony 
Salerno. "We had no idea we 
would be that close to Pomona

the men's relay in the UCSD Collegiate Invitational last Saturday. 

[on the men's side) , I think our 
depth on the women's side really 
overwhelmed everybody else 
more than anything. It was good 
to see the men step it up 
though." 

T he Triton women, coming off 
a second-place finish last week at 
Point Lama Nazarene University, 
scored 244 points, beating alit 
runner-up Point Lorna, who fin-
ished with 231. Division r UC 
Riverside fini shed third, followed 
by Cal Poly Pomona, Westmont 
College, _and Cal State San 
Marcos. Cuyamaca College of EI 
Cajon, Calif., also competed as a 
non-scoring team. 

Sara Allsup had hersel f a day 
with her 155' 2'" throw in the dis-
cus, fourth best in school history, 
improving on her qualification 
mark for this year's National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II Championships. Allsup 
also posted the fifth-best hammer 
throw ever at UCSD with a mark 
of 141 ' II". 

Audrey Sung had one of the 
day's most memorable perfor-
mances with her 4:42 .93 mark in 
the 1,500 meters, fini shing just .01 
seconds ahead of Westmont 
College's Sarah Eyman in a come-
from-behind victory. 

Not to be outdone, the 
women 's 4x400 reJay team 
squeezed out a victory over CaJ 
Poly Pomona when anchor Clara 
Wilson closed a gap of nearly 10 

meters and out-suetched the 
Broncos' anchor at the finish. The 
Tritons came through with a 
3:56.48 mark, just ahead of 
Pomona's 3:56.56. Roundi ng Out 
the event winners for the women 
was Kathy Read, who won the 
3,000 meters with a time of 
10:30.34. 

The men, not competing at full 
strength because of injuries, sti ll 
had one of their strongest outings 
of the season, finishing JUSt twO-
and-a-hal f points behind winner 
Cal Poly Pomona, who finished 
with 267 points. Point Lorna, UC 
Riverside, Cal State San, Marcos 
and Westmont followed, respec-
tively. 

Ma rk Gomez was the stand-
out on the men's side, according 
to Salerno, with a career-best 
height of 16' 3/4" in the pole 
vau lt, good enough to earn him 
an NCAA provisional qualifica-
tion bid and a first-place finish 
on the day. 

"He's one of the most deserving 
people I could think of - one of 
the most dedicated, hard-working 
people on the team," Salerno said. 
"As a senior this year, his hard 
work is paying off." 

The other Triton wins came in 
the 3,aOO-meter steeplechase, 
where Julian Nahan won with the 
eighth-best mark ever at UCSD, 
and the shot put, where Rob
