Although the massive cutbacks in 
state funding laid out in Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger’s 2008-09 budget sig-
nify imminent financial burdens for 
the UC system, officials announced 
last week that the university will con-
tinue its plan to offer admission to all 
applicants who meet eligibility require-
ments for Fall Quarter 2008. 

The university’s ability to maintain 
its longstanding admission practice 
was called into question earlier this 
year in the face of Schwarzenegger’s 
proposed budget, which allots the 10-
campus UC system $417 million less 
than the amount sought by the UC 
Board of Regents to adapt to a growing 
student population. 

Despite financial challenges, how-
ever, UC Provost Wyatt R. Hume said 
in a statement that the university feels 
it has a duty to provide eligible students 
with a place within the system. 

“With the strong increase in under-
graduate applications this year, we feel 
it is our obligation to California to 
continue meeting our commitments 
under the Master Plan for Higher 
Education and expand our enroll-
ment capacity as necessary,” Hume 
said. “Students have worked hard to 
become eligible for the university, and 
we do not want them to worry at the 
11th hour about whether they will 
have a place at UC.”

Facing a record-size applicant pool, 
university officials have stressed cau-
tion, saying that the decision to contin-
ue the eligibility practice will challenge 
the university’s capabilities. Officials 
have already announced that the prac-
tice will be discontinued for the 2009-

10 year unless necessary funding can 
be provided by the state at that time. 

“Enrolling additional students 
without additional state funding is not 
sustainable,” Hume said. “It clearly will 
bring additional pressure on the 2008-
09 budget.”

Decisions regarding how the uni-
versity will cope with these finan-
cial pressures have not been final-
ized, though officials indicated in the 
statement that measures will likely 
include budget reductions to a num-
ber of areas throughout the system, as 
well as additional increases in student 
fees.

While all eligible students will be 
offered a place at one of the UC cam-
puses, the high number of applicants 
may lead to fewer students being admit-
ted to their first-choice campus.

The impact of Schwarzenegger’s 
budget are not limited to the UC 
system. In order to combat the 
state’s projected $14.5-billion deficit, 
Schwarzenegger proposed 10-percent 
cuts to nearly all state-funded depart-
ments and programs, including the 
California State University and com-
munity college systems. Hume said 
that the three college systems are 
united in encouraging state officials 
to minimize the negative impact 
on higher education as a result of 
California’s budget crisis. 

“We stand with California State 
University and the California 
Community Colleges in urging our 
state’s leaders to consider the return 
on investment in higher education as 
they make budget decisions this year,” 
Hume said.

meeting to announce structural changes that his office will make to this year’s Sun God Festival.

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

Late last week, student program-
mers unveiled their overhauled version 
of the Sun God Festival, which will 
now be reorganized into five thematic 
regions on RIMAC Field. The newly 
engineered approach to the annual 
event, which attracts thousands of 
attendees and costs hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars, comes after yearlong 
discussions over organizers’ security 
and managerial tactics.

Now, the festival’s nighttime concert 
mainstay will be garnished with a bar-
rage of activities, all run throughout the 
day and concentrated on RIMAC Field. 
Additional attractions will include a 
“street fair” of booths operated by 
vendors and student organizations, a 
DJ-hosted dance and performances by 
local bands.

This year’s festival will also be the 
programming department’s first event 
to allow re-entry. Students will be 
able to enter and exit RIMAC Field 
with a wristband until a designated 
time. Entry wristbands, which will be 
required along with photo ID as the 
only forms of admittance, will be dis-
tributed the weekdays preceding the 
festival at locations at every college and 
one central site, programming officials 
said. No wristbands will be distributed 
the day of the festival.

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Programming Kevin Highland said he

ment’s new designs. It represents the 
first student-led attempt at not only 
restructuring the festival, he said, but 
also reassessing its campus impacts.

Last quarter, the programming 
department launched a full-fledged 
evaluation of Sun God, partnering with 
the University Events Office to field 
input from a number of campus depart-
ments. The range of complaints and 
suggestions was widely mixed: Police 
officials lamented the pervasive alco-
hol presence, parking administrators 
said the event cramped campus infra-
structure and student policy officials 
found the event’s date inconvenient to 
prosecution procedures. All comments 
were compiled into a 22-page report 
released in October. 

Student programmers said they 
used the report’s recommendations, 
and ongoing debriefing meetings fol-
lowing its release, as a touchstone for 
their re-imagined festival.

Committee Finds Merit to 
D.O.C. Curriculum Complaints 

program.
“If the university intends to continue its 

commitment to the college system — and 
to the crucial intellectual, social and com-
munity foundations for the college curricula 
were designed to provide incoming first-
year undergraduates and transfer students 
— then we feel it is necessary that TMC and 
the larger university recommit the resources 
necessary to revamp the D.O.C. sequence, 
adequately train and mentor TAs and staff 
the course with ladder-rank faculty,” the 
report stated.

Committee members voiced satisfaction 
with the report, which took more than nine 
months to complete.

“The committee was unanimous on all 
of its recommendations,” history professor 
David Gutierrez said. “I think we did a pretty 
comprehensive and thorough job in terms of 
reviewing the program’s history and what’s 
been going on lately, and I think we came up 
with some good ideas about how to reform 
the program.”

A committee in charge of evaluating 
Thurgood Marshall College’s Dimensions 
of Culture undergraduate writing sequence 
released a comprehensive report last week 
confirming public critiques that the program 
had lost focus in its commitment to higher 
standards of learning.

The Curriculum Review Committee’s 
report addressed concerns over the recurring 
structural issues that the writing sequence 
has encountered since its formation in 1990. 
The committee’s concerns included a lack of 
cooperation among the program’s faculty, 
staff and teaching assistants, the controver-
sial nature of the courses, the pedagogi-
cal integrity of a program whose primary 
emphasis consists of writing instruction and 
the absence of ladder-rank faculty — faculty 
members holding tenured titles or nonten-
ured titles in a series in which tenure may 
be achieved. It also stressed the need for 
both TMC and D.O.C. administrators to 
collaborate on a major effort to modify the See D.O.C., page 2

The CRC — comprised of seven 

professors from six UCSD depart-
ments — was created at the request 
of Marshall Provost Allan Havis last 
May after D.O.C. administrators 
decided to not rehire two of the pro-
gram’s TAs, sparking a protest from 
the Lumumba-Zapata Coalition, a 
diverse group of UCSD students 
and faculty. 

LZC members launched a public 
campaign against what they called 
the effective “watering down” of the 
D.O.C. program. 

With LZC’s backing, a wave 
of student demonstrations spread 
across campus, raising questions 
about the intellectual health of the 
program since its inception almost 
two decades ago.

While the report marks a signifi-
cant breakthrough for concerned 
students and faculty, some members 
of the UCSD community worried 
about issues that the report did not 
address, such as the dismissal of the 
two TAs and broader questions of 
academic freedom that the decision 
posed. 

LZC representative Benjamin 
Balthaser, one of the TAs who was 
not rehired last year, said that the 
group was disappointed in the scope 
of some of the report’s findings.

“The LZC supports many of the 
findings of the committee report, 
namely that D.O.C. has failed in 
recent years to fulfill its special role 
on campus to present marginalized 
viewpoints,” Balthaser said. “Yet, the 
LZC feels the report does not go far 
enough, both in terms of pedagogy 
and its silence on the issue of aca-

demic freedom in the program. We 
also have to question why two TAs 
were dismissed, and why numerous 
other staff and faculty have been 
pushed out of the D.O.C. program 
for issuing a similar critique.”

Some involved in the program 
questioned how the report’s com-
ments would be implemented, as 
the committee operates solely in an 
advisory capacity. 

“It seems to me that the prospects 
for the future revolve around two 
issues,” Gutierrez said. “The first is 
whether the university is going to 
commit the resources necessary to 
implement the recommendations of 
this report. That’s the critical thing, 
and it involves not just the material 
resources, but it also requires the 
university to adhere to the roles and 
the function of the writing program. 
Step two is whether we can generate 
faculty interest in taking over the 
interest.”

D.O.C. Director Abraham 
Shragge, an administrator at the cen-
ter of last year’s controversy, said he 
could not confirm whether UCSD 
will fully implement the report’s rec-
ommendations. However, he said 
TMC faculty will meet with mem-
bers of the campus community dur-
ing the next few weeks to discuss the 
program’s future options.

Depending on TMC administra-
tors’ receptiveness, D.O.C. commit-
tee members expect class instruc-
tion to begin with the complete 
revised curriculum by Fall Quarter 
2010.

The report focused heavily on secu-
rity concerns, many of which student 
politicians admittedly said were appro-
priate, in light of last year’s troublesome 
festival. While the evening attracted 
record numbers of attendees, the level 
of citations and arrests spiked and 
entrance lines generated several secu-
rity problems. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue said last year’s Sun God had 
reached a “tipping point.” She empha-
sized the report’s suggestions to estab-
lish a community-building event that 
bonds the campus.

The new Sun God meets students’ 
and administrators’ demands for stron-
ger community ideals, said Garrett 
Berg, festival coordinator for the pro-
gramming department.

“We want to support students rep-
resenting their orgs and showing off 
their artwork and films,” Berg said 
after revealing the department’s plans. 
“There will be a space for all of those 
things now within Sun God’s newfound 
atmosphere.”

Highland said his department is 
heavily relying on its student volun-
teers to shoulder the extra manage-
rial weight generated from the new 
plans. The event will be better man-
aged through simple changes such as 
the new re-entry procedure, Berg said, 
which sheds last year’s malfunctioning 
ID-scanning systems.

Berg added that there are still details 
to be finalized, including the location of 
the fan-favorite Junkyard Derby. Berg 
also said that this year’s concert would 
substitute the traditional fireworks dis-
play with a pyrotechnic attraction. 

The concert is slated for May 16.

In light of Eating Disorder Awareness Week, I would like to take this time to both embrace 
and flaunt my inner fat-ass. 

I’m not afraid to admit the fact 
that I get weak in the knees over trans 
fat. I love to stuff my face chock full 
of candies (fruit-flavored, not choco-
late), chips (the 
saltier, the better), 
soda (preferably 
ice-cold Mountain 
Dew) and any-
thing and every-
thing that comes 
out of a window 
— microwave or 
drive-thru. I dream of Jack in the 
Box tacos, and my mouth waters like 
one of Pavlov’s dogs at the sight of a 
Western Bacon Cheeseburger.

Don’t get me wrong. I know that 
fast food is somewhat unhealthy and 
that I could probably be a lot nicer to 
my aorta by ceasing my ingestion of 
fried foods, but I just don’t care. It’s 
readily available, quick, cheap and 
tastes delicious. And to all you haters 
out there who say otherwise, you’re 
lying. Plus, not being a die-hard calo-

rie-counter eliminates a lot of would-
be stress in my life. Instead, I’m able 
to enjoy the finer things — such as 
fried zucchini and orange chicken 
— guilt-free. 

To those individuals who swear 
they vomit at the sight of fast food 
(“McDonald’s is sooooo disgusting”), 

I call bullshit. You 
cannot honestly 
sit there and tell 
me that your taste 
buds aren’t tick-
led by the touch 
of a hot, greasy, 
freshly cooked 
French fry or a 

sumptuously sweet soft-serve vanilla 
cone.

If you come out with the real 
reason you have fast-food phobia and 
admit that you’re unrealistically afraid 
of the fat and carbohydrates that 
inevitably accompany said French fry 
consumption, that’s a different story 
entirely. But don’t say that you hate 
the way fast food “tastes,” unless you 
want me to sock you in the face.

And c’mon, people. Don’t tell me 
that an occasional foray into fast-food 

world is the be-all, end-all of your 
chiseled abs or size zero frames. I feel 
like all of you just need to relax and 
eat a cheeseburger or two, because 
the world would definitely be a better 
place if you all just chilled out. The 
nonsensical fear of becoming fat over 
even sporadic consumption of any 
fast food, snack food or junk food 
is major factor perpetuating eating 
disorders in the first place.

If you’ve ever seen the commer-
cials, you know that fast food tran-
scends age, race, language barriers 
(the McDonald’s “I’m lovin’ it” cam-
paign, anyone?) and even teaches 
people how to break dance and suc-
ceed at playing Double Dutch. It truly 
does have the power to unite humans 
behind a common cause: delicious-
ness.

There’s a fast food restaurant for 
everyone. Mexican, Chinese, All-
American, Greek — whatever you 
could ever want or imagine, I guaran-
tee it exists somewhere in the sprawl-
ing world of drive-thrus and Happy 
Meals. 

And since I’m spouting the virtues 
of fast food so unabashedly, I want to 

soothe any lingering doubts you may 
have about embracing its wonders by 
providing a personal guide for you to 
use the next time you decide you’re 
hungry for greasy goodness.

There is a complex spectrum of 
restaurants offering fast-food con-
noisseurs everything from grease-
soaked takeout bags to friendly table-
side service (yes, despite the waitress, 
Denny’s is still a proud member of 
the fast-food industry). In order to 
break it down as simply as possible, 
I’m going to organize my guide by 
food type: burger joints, international 
flavors and the obligatory category of 
“other.”

Burger joints
I’ll start with McDonald’s, every-

one’s favorite restaurant to hate. 
Although Ronald is creepy and 
Grimace is unidentifiable, the food is 
hands-down delectable — especially 
breakfast items such as McGriddles 
and Egg McMuffins (perfect for 
soothing any stomach upset after a 
long night of drinking). If you ven-
ture in for a late-afternoon snack, be 
sure to grab a chipotle crispy chicken 

snack-wrap. Trust me, you’ll thank 
me later. Carnivores should go after 
the McNuggets — bonus points for 
the boot-shaped ones, which are spe-
cifically engineered for dipping. And 
don’t forget those trademark fries.

Wendy’s, if you can look past 
square-shaped meat patties, features 
delicious side items such as baked 
potatoes and chili, which you won’t 
readily find anywhere else. But Jack 
in the Box, my personal favorite, 
takes side items to the extreme: egg 
rolls, spicy chicken bites, bacon-and-
cheddar potato wedges, those deca-
dent two-for-99-cents tacos and, of 
course, Jesus embodied as food in the 
scrumptious Ultimate Cheeseburger. 
Avoid Burger King at all costs unless 
you want death on a bun and leave 
In-N-Out for the rookies — it’s not 
that good, people. The fries suck.

International flavors
This category plays host to a wide 

array of restaurants, including Taco 
Bell, which championed the idea of

Fast-Food Enthusiast Shares His Greasy Secrets, Trans-Fat Tales

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — In the wake of 
the recently proposed bill that would 
cover in-state tuition for National 
Guardsmen, it is necessary to closely 
look at current federal legislation 
governing postsecondary education 
for U.S. veterans: the GI Bill. 

Originally passed in 1944 as the 
Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, its 
most recent edition theoretically 
provides GIs with the opportunity 
to receive up to a maximum of 
$36,141 over 36 months to pay for 
college tuition. 

Unfortunately, many veterans do 
not see the original total promised 
to them, and even if they do receive 
an amount close to that number, the 
process’ bureaucratic loopholes and 
complicated stipulations confuse 
many soldiers, frequently mark-
ing returns from duty with uncer-
tainty. According to the Finding 
Alternatives to Military Enlistment 
Web site, the average payout for vet-
erans is a mere $2,151, which is not 
even enough to cover UCSD fees for 
one quarter.

A major criticism levied at the 
GI Bill deals with recruiting issues 
— people on both sides of the politi-
cal spectrum have condemned the 
tactics employed by the military in 
order to get civilians to enlist. While 
tales of straight-out lies and false 
promises abound, an indisputable 
fact is that one of the main recruit-
ing guarantees is a military-funded 
college education after a soldier’s 
tour of duty is completed. 

For any student wanting to 
attend a four-year university, 
$36,000 is nowhere near enough 
money. Consider also that the total 
amount that the military has given 
to veterans through the GI Bill 
is only one-eighth the amount it 
has spent on recruiting, according 
to the American Friends Service 
Committee, a group that performs 
service, development and peace 
programs worldwide.

So why are many enlisting sol-
diers still under the impression that 
their education will be covered by 
the military? One of the reasons 
might be that recruiters often throw 
around the number $70,000, telling 
enlistees that much will be acces-
sible to them upon returning to 

civilian life. It’s true that servicemen 
can be given 70 grand for college, 
but just not under the GI Bill, as is 
the general perception. The $70,000 
is from of the Army/Navy College 
Fund, which only about one in 20 
soldiers are even eligible for. 

On top of not having access to 
necessary college funds, veterans 
must pay a nonrefundable deposit 
to the GI Bill to even be considered 
for its benefits later on. To qualify 
for the GI Bill, a serviceman has to 
pay $100 every month for the first 
12 months of active duty, an amount 
that would theoretically be repaid in 
the future. 

But if a veteran is given a less-
than-honorable discharge (as 
around one in four are), leaves the 
military in fewer than three years 
(as one in three do) or decides later 
on to not even go to college, the 
military keeps every single penny of 
that $1,200.

This year, a group of veterans 
attending UCSD formed the Student 
Veterans Organization, hoping to 
build a supportive community for 
veterans on campus and create a 
forum to better educate their peers 
on how to successfully maneuver 
the muddled GI Bill. The group 
has about 20 members, representing 
UCSD’s just-over 200 veterans.

Earl Warren College senior Erik 
Matson served six years in the 
Navy, the first four as an electronics 
technician specializing in satellite 
communications and the last two 
as a search-and-rescue swimmer. 
Matson will graduate in December 
with a degree in human biology 

and plans to attend dental school. 
His experience with the GI Bill is 
typical of veterans: He returned 
from his tour of duty and attended 
junior college before transferring to 
UCSD. According to Matson, the GI 
Bill is very complicated, and makes 
enrolling and graduating within a 
normal timeframe very difficult for 
veterans. 

“The only downfall is that you 
only get 36 months worth of ben-
efits,” Matson said. “If you only go 
to school part time, then you only 
get paid for part time and it will still 
count toward your 36 months. It can 
be a real hassle when you’re taking 
classes at different schools and the 
sessions overlap or leave gaps.” 

Last summer Matson took one 
class during each UCSD summer 
session, two classes at Mesa College 
and a class at Miramar College 
— the equivalent of 20 units. But 
because  the junior college classes 
ended in August and UCSD ended 
in September, he only received part-
time funding.

The problem he raises is a crucial 
one. The military only gives veter-
ans a span of 36 months to com-

plete their education. While some 
are fortunate enough to obtain their 
degree before the 36-month dead-
line expires, many people switch 
majors, endure personal problems 
or simply need extra time to decide 
their academic futures. Similarly, 
a veteran who attends a vocational 
or two-year school does not have 
access to the supposed $36,000, but 
is instead paid only for the short-
er amount of time they choose to 
attend school.

Kenyon Ralph, a Warren College 
computer engineering major in his 
second quarter at UCSD, is a half-
year into using his GI Bill funds 
after transferring from Palomar 
and MiraCosta community colleg-
es. Ralph joined the Marine Corps 
in 2001 and made two tours to 
Iraq before leaving the Corps last 
year with the rank of sergeant. An 
important difference between him 
and other veterans, as he pointed 
out, is that he is not entirely depen-
dent on the GI Bill to pay for his 

college education. But his awareness 
of the escalating problems service-
men face with the GI Bill is the main 
reason that he takes such an active 
role in SVO. 

“Although I don’t have much to 
complain about, I know a lot of 
people do, which is why we started 
this vets club,” Ralph said. “We can 
at least try to make the process 
smoother for future students at 
UCSD. I’m not sure how the gov-
ernment should be fixed, but I think 
we’re doing what we can to improve 
things at UCSD at least.”

The fact that veterans must 
oftentimes fly solo during the tran-
sition from serviceman to student 
showcases a blatant failure by the 
military to help facilitate the pro-
cess. How can the military justify 
sending these young people overseas 
to fight a war, then deny them an 
education later? If the government 
is, indeed, hell-bent on continuing 
wars around the globe, the absolute 
very least it must do is ensure the 
well-being and futures of the very 
people whose lives are at risk.

ly between dinner and breakfast. 
Mexican pizzas (sans tomatoes) and 
Double-Decker Tacos are always a safe 
bet, and every bite of the Crunchwrap 
Supreme is to be savored. 

Panda Express and other Asian-
themed eateries conveniently offer 
multi-item combos, and mushroom 
chicken and chow mein are guaran-
teed to please even the most reluctant 
palate.

However, Del Taco takes the crown 
in this category. Moving from Orange 
County, where there’s a DT on every 
corner, to San Diego has severely 
hampered my ability to consume 

those signature chili-cheese fries and 
Chicken Spicy Jack Quesadillas. But 
trust me, if you want a little taste of 
heaven and don’t mind driving for 
a good 15 to 20 minutes, there are 
a few DTs sprinkled throughout the 
veins of San Diego for your benefit 
and enjoyment.

Other
Wienerschnitzel, Arby’s and KFC 

are this category’s main highlights. 
Often scoffed at by even the most 
dedicated fast-food patrons, these 
establishments are nonetheless as 
delicious as their hamburger neigh-
bors. Try a plain old chili cheese 

dog at Wienerschnitzel and a Beef ‘n 
Cheddar sandwich at Arby’s to maxi-
mize your exposure to the diverse 
tastes of the fast-food world. And any 
original recipe item — strips, whole 
pieces or popcorn variety— at KFC is 
guaranteed to be mouth-watering.

So now I say to all you reluctant 
eaters: Welcome to my world. Forget 
salad for a night and just accept your 
inner fat-ass. Let go of all your fear, 
all your shame and all those fin-
ger-in-the-chili urban legends you’ve 
heard, and order that burger. For 
once, just enjoy the taste and stop 
obsessing over nutrition facts. You 
won’t be sorry, and you will be full.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

By Joanna Cardenas 
Contributing Writer 

It’s Thursday night with 15 minutes 
until show time, and the members of San 
Diego’s premier college improvisational 
team are huddled together in a small alcove 
above the National Comedy Theater’s stage. 
They shout in comedic tongues as they 
play “Zoom Schwartz Pafigliano” and “Zip 
Zap Zop,” preshow rituals intended to har-
ness their collective energy. As the mod-
est, yet loyal, audience begins to fill the 
auditorium,  the NCT College Team plans 
to uphold the theater’s motto — “bring a 
change of pants.”

While the NCT has served as a local 
source of improv for over two decades, the 
NCT College Team, N(CT)2, is a year-old 
offshoot to the theater’s weekly lineup, 
featuring some of UCSD’s most promising 
improv comedians along with a sample 

of comedic talent from other local col-
leges. Each of the current 18 members, 
five of whom hail from UCSD, underwent 
a rigorous audition process consisting of 
a six-week workshop period before they 
made the team. The result was a “silly, witty, 
sarcastic and dirty” group unlike any other, 
according to N(CT)2 member and Sixth 
College sophomore Katie Willert.

“This team creates a whole new dynam-
ic,” said N(CT)2 coach and UCSD alumna 
Marina Mastros. “They have an unparal-
leled amount of energy, but it’s a totally 
different kind of energy.” 

Because N(CT)2 shows are similar 
in style to the popular television series 
“Whose Line is it Anyway?,” improvis-
ers like Revelle College senior Geoffrey 
Lapid must think on their feet for the most 
effective way to communicate their chosen 
characters — such as the Feb. 14 show’s 
Catwoman and K.I.S.S. roles — to their 
teammates. 

“[Improv] is great because it gives us 
the opportunity to be silly in a controlled 
environment,” Lapid said. “I really got into 
it when I realized that improv is a lot of 
fun with a lot of layers involved in the per-
formance. There are a few basic structures 
that a scene needs, like C.R.O.W., which 

stands for character, relationships, objects 
and where.”

To an outsider, preparation for improvi-
sation may seem futile, but members agree 
that it is necessary to learn these basic 
structures to perform a successful scene. 
To facilitate this, the team has free access to 
workshops, priced over $100 for nonmem-
bers. To make sure their creative energy 
isn’t misguided on stage, N(CT)2 meets 
every Sunday to perform exercises like “Big 
Booty,” “Electric Company” and “Go.”

“Besides being taught by professionals, 
you get to perform regularly for an audi-
ence,” said Mastros, whom the team affec-
tionately refers to as Marina Mastros-and-
Defender because she regulates the quality 
of comedy as the team’s referee. 

N(CT)2 and other on-campus improv 
teams, like UCSD’s Muir-based FOOSH and 
SDSU’s I H Pi, collaborate often through 
performances like N(CT)2’s “Represent 
Your School Night.” Every last Thursday 
of the month, N(CT)2 challenges a local 
college team to an improv match at its the-
ater. February’s night was against FOOSH. 
The three members of N(CT)2  who also 
belong to FOOSH — Lapid, Revelle College ANDREW RUIZ/GUARDIAN

An N(CT)2 member gestures dramatically and sticks out her tongue in a skit 
at the National Comedy Theater during the group’s Valentine’s performance.

With clever humor and a 
light attitude, the National 
Comedy Theater College 
Team just wants to make 
people laugh.

T he life of Marie Villalobos is not that different from any other UCSD student. She is studying 
biology and psychology, likes to cook, 
enjoys the outdoors and records folk 
music with a band when she finds 

the time. But life hasn’t always been 
easy. Villalobos’ identification cards, 

school records and trips home serve 
as testaments to her complicated 

past. Although she has always 
identified as Marie, she spent 
most of her life as Martin.

Villalobos is part of 
UCSD’s small group of trans-
gendered students. Although 
the term transgender refers 
to a broad spectrum of indi-
viduals whose internal gen-
der identity deviates from the 
physical sex with which they 
were born, efforts to over-
come being at odds with one’s 
biological sex can range from 
cross dressing to sexual reas-
signment surgery. However, 

in all cases, transgen-
dered individuals are a 
little-understood minor-
ity whom the campus has 
recently taken initiatives to 

better address and accept.
Beginning her physi-

cal transition years ago, 
Villalobos now lives her 
college life as a woman. 
But when she goes home 
for the weekend, she is 
forced back into men’s 
clothes, becoming 
Martin once again, to 
satisfy her family’s pref-
erences.

Villalobos said she 
receives looks on the 
train and hears the 

question, “Is that a 
boy or a girl?” 

— com-

ments that sting deeply.
“It just brings your whole world down 

when somebody [does not recognize your 
gender identity],” Villalobos said. “Because 
you’re thinking ‘I thought I looked good. 
I thought I was projecting a good image’ 
but somebody saw through it. In the end, 
you just want to be accepted in society.”

The daily experience of a transgen-
dered person is fraught with anxiety, said 
John Muir College senior Ariel Smith. 
Not passing as one’s internal gender 
sometimes attracts stares, harassment or 
discrimination. 

But, according to Smith, people’s 
judgments are based on unusual gender 
expression.

“That could mean a straight guy dress-
ing up as a girl on Halloween who faces 
discrimination for it,” she said. “For being 
‘too butch,’ ‘too fem’ or for ‘looking gay.’ 
It’s a kind of oppositional sexism where 
you have to fit into one of two camps, 
masculine or feminine, and any deviation 
from either camp will result in discrimi-
nation. The reason why [transgendered 
people] experience it so much is because 
we have a very compelling reason to break 
these rules.” 

Although Smith occasionally encoun-
ters problems in public, especially when 
presenting a male driver license when 
trying to enter a bar, the atmosphere at 
UCSD, in contrast, is pretty transgender-
friendly, she said.

Smith cited the sensitive treatment 
by campus administrators, progres-
sive policies and the empowerment of 
the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender 
Resource Center as examples of UCSD’s 
liberal nature. The new resource center 
is the largest on any public campus in the 
nation, she said.

The opening of the center was a major 
turning point in getting things done for 
the LGBT community, said Francesco 
Carusi, former co-chair of the Chancellor’s 
Advisory Committee on Gender Identity 
and Sexual Orientation Issues. Since a 

space was first allocated to the 
LGBT community in 1999, 
the campus has come a 
long way, Carusi said. 

One of the center’s most 
recent initiatives, pioneered 
by LGBT Resource Center 
Director Shaun Travers, 
has been to change Student 
Health Service’s policies to 
insure transgendered care.

As of Fall 2007, up to 
$25,000 in any given year 
is covered by the Student 
Health Insurance Plan 
for hormone replacement 
therapy or sexual reassign-
ment surgery — procedures 
that nearly all other student 
and employee insurance 
policies across the coun-
try exclude, according 
to www.tgender.net, a 
transgender informa-
tion Web site.

UCSD is the only 
University of California 
campus and possibly the 
nation’s only university 
that offers such health 
care options,  LGBT 
Resource Center Assistant 
Director of Education Jan 
Estrellado said.

While UCSD does 
not currently have any 
affiliated surgeons at this 
time, students who meet 
the standards for care can 
receive a referral from 
Student Health for off-site 
surgery or treatment from 
endocrinologists in the 
campus network, according 
to Insurance Coordinator 
for Student Health Services 
Jessica Morris.

A Vicious Circle’s Vacant Faces
Slavery is not dead in this country. In fact, worldwide, there are more slaves than 
ever, according to a report by Anti-
Slavery International. In the inter-
national sex-trade industry, pover-
ty is fuel and the targets of enslave-
ment are mainly women and chil-
dren. The Victims of Trafficking 
and Violence Protection Act of 
2000 has helped 
police recog-
nize that these 
victims are not 
actually crimi-
nals themselves. 
Once lured by 
traffickers who 
promise paying 
jobs, many are transported across 
international borders to work in 
foreign locations where they can 
be more easily controlled. As a 
border city, San Diego has its share 
of victims from around the world, 
brought in from Mexico to be pros-
tituted on the streets or through 
Web sites like Craigslist.

All this I learned from the Feb. 
29 “STOP TRAFFIC: Human Sex 
Trafficking” on-campus event. On 
a whim, I had gone to see how the 
issue would be treated — wheth-
er the speakers would talk about 
a vague, distant issue in a poor 
country on another continent, or 
a pressing local tragedy. It wasn’t 
until Deputy Sheriff Rick Castro 
of the San Diego County Sheriff ’s 
Department took the podium that 
the event really got my attention. 
As part of the San Diego Region 
Human Trafficking Task Force, 
he revealed the local ends of the 
worldwide trafficking industry. His 
language was direct and sometimes 
bordering on indelicate, but he had 
the firsthand experience to back up 
his assertions.

One part of his speech really got 

my mind turning. He was mention-
ing San Diego’s problem areas, such 
as Hotel Circle and Seaport Village 
and suggested that if the audience 
were to go to Hotel Circle that night 
between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. they 
would see about 10 young girls just 
standing outside. Though, he said, 
if you’d ask them what they were 
doing, they would deny everything 

and say they 
were waiting 
for someone. 
He explained 
that because of 
the coercion 
and threats of 
h u m i l i a t i o n 
that the traf-

fickers use, they have the luxury 
of sending their victims out alone, 
even with a cell phone and a car.

So, after talking more with 
Castro after the event, I went to 
Hotel Circle the next night in the 
hopes of answering his challenge to 
find these victims, and maybe even 
bring some pictures back as proof 
of the personal tragedies incurred 
by this global problem. I arrived at 
around 10:30 p.m., driving slowly 
down the quiet road to gauge the 
territory. I saw almost no one, let 
alone someone who could have 
possibly been a trafficking victim, 
but I didn’t get discouraged.

At the western end of the vast 
stretch of hotels I parked my car 
and went into a convenience store. 
A quick browse of the aisles yielded 
me some sunflower seeds. When 
one cashier saw my camera he 
remarked that it was too bad he 
didn’t have one himself just a short 
while before to take a picture of the 
naked woman sitting in the park-
ing lot.

My eyes were wide as I asked 
him about it. In matching Southern 
drawls the two cashiers recount-

ed how a woman in her 30s was  
in front of the store, completely 
naked. The cashiers said she “didn’t 
look good,” as though they were 
more concerned about her level of 
attractiveness than her situation. In 
describing what she was doing, the 
cashier who sold me the sunflower 
seeds reiterated, “Just sitting.”

The episode set the tone for 
my night. Someone’s loneliness or 
despair always seemed one step 
ahead, and I couldn’t catch up. 
There were certainly clues every-
where. In front of more than one 
hotel I found vending machines 
for papers advertising “Girls gone 
bad,” and “100s of Personal Photo 
Ads.” I later passed an open bottle 
of Vodka in the gutter, still upright, 
half full and cold.

After talking to the cashiers I 
realized that I had probably missed 
one of the victims of whom Castro 
was speaking, which was unfortu-
nate because I didn’t see another 
that night. Walking up and down 
Hotel Circle for hours with my 
camera discretely tucked in my 
jacket, shelling a sunflower seed 
every 10 feet or so, I at least got 
a feel for the area. Deserted busi-
nesses interrupted hotel after hotel. 
Signs in Hotel Circle offer ironic 
contradictions to the seedy nature 
of the place; I walked by a 24-hour 
“family” restaurant, and one hotel’s 
billboard was lettered, “Welcome 
Pastor Convention.” Next to one 
hotel’s “No Vacancy” signs, anoth-
er’s rooms were mostly empty. More 
ominous than the long stretches of 
unoccupied rooms, though, was the 
one room out of the lot that had a 
light on and a car out in front. 

Ultimately, it’s the transitory 
nature of the area’s residents that 
makes such stark contrasts. A family 
spending the night before their big 
trip to Sea World certainly wouldn’t

sophomore Sam Hunter and Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Nam 
Nguyen — played with N(CT)2 as 
standard home-game practice. 

“You get to know your team-
mates’ humor and it’s just exciting 
when you throw new people into 
the mix,” Willert said. “When you 
work with someone from a different 
team, you’re exposed to their whole 
different philosophy of comedy. Even 
things like pacing can be different.”

Members’ experiences with 
N(CT)2 prove valuable in other 
aspects of life. According to Mastros, 
improv is a great way to boost self 
confidence and public speaking skills. 
Willert believes improv will help her 
acting endeavors. Improv comedy for 
Lapid, aside from being a relaxing 
alternative to academic pressures, is 
enticing for other reasons.

“I’m in it for the fabulous prizes 
and the beautiful women,” Lapid said. 
“Actually, I’ve seen Comedy Sportz 
shows before and I was like, ‘Yay! I 
can be a part of this.’” 

As much as they get out of per-
forming, N(CT)2 members also 
like to give back to the San Diego 
community. Following the example 
set by the NCT’s main team, who 
have entertained troops in Iraq sev-
eral times, the N(CT)2 collaborat-
ed with FOOSH and I H Pi to aid 
San Diegans displaced by the 2007 
California Wildfires.

“It was one of the coolest things 
I’ve ever done not only as an impro-
viser, but just as a person. It was 
nice just to be able to make them 
laugh and the kids were really into it,” 
Willert said. 

Their crowd at Qualcomm 
Stadium began small, but grew in 
size to about 100 people according 
to Lapid.

“It felt really good to see that [the 
audience] made some sort of connec-
tion with us and that they enjoyed 
having us around,” Lapid said.

Whether they are using improv 
to aid a needy community or to 
make college kids laugh on Thursday 
nights, N(CT)2 members continue to 
hone their art with a unique outlook 
on life.

“The world is a really funny place 
and with improv we have a venue to 
point out how ridiculous life can be,” 
Lapid said. “We don’t always have to 
be all frowny-pantsed. Finding the 
silliness and fun there is in life is a 
good message to spread. It’s a good

Eligibility for sexual reassign-
ment surgery is outlined by the Harry 
Benjamin Standards of Care, which 
strictly defines the effective treatment 
for gender identity disorder, includ-
ing counseling along with medical and 
surgical care.

Some, however, question the medi-
cal necessity of sexual reassignment 
surgery, which has been labeled “exper-
imental” and “cosmetic” by some insur-
ance providers and media sources .

“I understand that [being transgen-
dered] is not a choice,” Revelle College 
senior Hannah Basset said. “But I’m 
not sure [hormone treatment or sexu-
al reassignment surgery] are medical 
needs either.”

Villalobos said that while she 
understands how surgery can seem 
superficial, living comfortably as 
one’s identified gender is dependent 
upon the perception and treatment 
by society.

“People around us are mirrors,” she 
said. “They call us ‘he’ or ‘she’ and that 
tells us who we are. You may feel more 
like a female or male on the inside, but 
how you are treated by others is deter-
mined almost solely by your appear-
ance on the outside. This is a cause of 
discomfort when how you feel doesn’t 
match up with how you look.”

Other efforts of the LGBT Resource 
Center and the CACGISOI have focused 
on opening more single-stall gender-
neutral restrooms, providing housing 
options for members of the LGBT com-
munity and spreading awareness about 
transgender-related issues.

Unisex restrooms are significant 
because they provide harassment-free 
access for gender nonconformists along 
with families and people with disabili-
ties, Estrellado said.

The LGBT Resource Center is also 
working with Housing and Dining 
Services, resident deans, resident advis-
ers and house advisers to provide safe 
and supportive housing options for the 

LGBT community, which Villalobos, 
who spent her freshman year in boys’ 
dorms acting like a male, said are 
important.

Three years ago, Mesa Housing on 
Regents Road started opening up same-
household married-student housing to 
LGBT couples who could not legally 
marry, Carusi said.

John Muir College also has co-ed 
apartments that are more conducive to 
the transgendered population.

Additionally, the CACGISOI has 
recommended innovative housing 
options like that of other UC cam-
puses that offer LGBT-themed floors 
or buildings aimed to promote under-
standing of gender-identity and sexual-
orientation issues. The goal is to cre-
ate LGBT communities in each of the 
six colleges, the 2006-07 CACGISOI 
annual report said.

While UCSD is ahead of other cam-
puses and the general public in many 
ways, there is still room for improve-
ment in educating students on campus 
who tend to be less sensitive to trans-
gender issues than administration, staff 
and faculty, Villalobos said.

The LGBT Resource Center has a 
Speakers Bureau made up of an LGBT 
panel that reaches out to student orga-
nizations, campus departments, classes, 
residence halls and high school confer-
ences to raise awareness.

But much work still needs to be 
done to fight campus ignorance and 
give transgendered people a voice, 
according to Smith.

“It’s just not an experience that any-
one can fathom unless they’re going 
through it,” Smith said. “The trans 
community is very small and many of 
us don’t feel as free to be out as other 
communities do. That in part reduces 
our voice and our visibility, so we really 
need allies as much as any group to 
help achieve equality.”

MONDAY, MARCH 3, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

lead of the game by a score of 8-7 
less than two minutes into the con-
test and never relinquished the lead 
to the Otters. 

The Tritons took a double-digit 
lead over Cal State Monterey Bay on 
a jump shot from Osier with 16:01 left 
in the half. UCSD continued to knock 
down its shots, taking a 20-point lead 
off a jump shot from senior center 
Diahn Futalan with 8:42 left in the first 
half. With UCSD in complete control, 
the Tritons took a 46-27 lead over the 
Otters into halftime. 

Down by 19 points, Cal State 
Monterey Bay came out in the sec-
ond half with a sense of urgency. The 
Otters began slowly chipping away at 
the Tritons’ lead, cutting it to 46-55 
with 7:05 left in regulation. But UCSD 
did not let the Otters get any closer, 
as the Tritons scored 13 unanswered 
points to put the game out of the 
Otters’ reach. 

“I’m really proud of our team,” 
Noud said. “It’s not easy going on 
the road and winning two games. It’s 
something that we’ve struggled with 
all season.” 

The Tritons will begin their post-
season against San Francisco State 
on March 4 at home for their first 
game of the CCAA Championship 
Tournament. 

“San Francisco State is a dangerous 
and athletic team — they play hard,” 
Elliott said. “We need to focus on 
rebounding and taking care of the ball 
and we’ll be in good shape.”

If the Tritons win that contest, they 
will head to San Bernardino, where the 
semifinals and championship game 
will be held on March 7 and March 8. 

Readers can contact Janani Sridharan 
at jsridhar@ucsd.edu.

While the early game was a real 
nail-bitter, the day’s second game 
was a blowout from the get-go. After 
posting single runs in each of the 
first two frames off of senior start-
er Nicole Fullerton, Cal State San 
Bernardino exploded for eight hits 
and eight runs in the bottom of the 
third inning to take a 10-run lead. 
Fullerton would settle down for the 
rest of the game but a fourth-inning 
homerun from junior first baseman 
Jenni Habib, her first of the season, 
was all the offense the Tritons could 
muster, and they fell 10-1 for their 
first two-game losing streak of the 
year.

Despite the tough loses, the 
Tritons have been able to keep things 
in perspective and want to use their 
sub-par games to build momentum 
and get to the level of play that they 
are capable of.

“We had a rough weekend, but 
we know we’re better and we know 
we’ll bounce back,” senior second 
baseman Danielle Lukk said. “I’m 
not happy with our performance, but 
I know we’re only going go up from 
here. We just need to learn from it 
and leave the rest behind us.”

Determined to overcome the two-
game skid, Ward stepped up as the 
team’s stopper on March 1 and deliv-
ered a signature complete game to lead 
her team to a 3-1 victory. Ward scat-
tered six hits over her seven innings of 
work and picked up seven strikeouts 
en route to her sixth win of the year. 
In the fourth inning, Maze again deliv-
ered the big hit, this time crushing a 
three-run homerun that would prove 
to be more than enough cushion for 
Ward throughout the rest of the game. 
Maze, whose homerun was her 29th 
career shot, was 4-for-8 on the week-
end and picked up 5 RBIs.

Following the lopsided loss in the 

nightcap on Feb. 29, the second leg 
of the March 1 doubleheader again 
saw the Tritons on the losing end of 
a blowout game. Despite grabbing 
a first-inning 2-0 lead off of two 
unearned Triton runs, sophomore 
starter Christine Zankich could not 
make it out of the second inning, 
as she gave up five runs in one-
plus innings of work. Ward came 
in to relieve Zankich and did not 
fare much better, yielding seven runs, 
only four of which were earned, over 
3.1 innings of relief work. Key hits by 
Maze and sophomore catcher Nicole 
Saari produced two fourth-inning 
runs, but the Coyotes offense did not 
slow down and the game was called 
after just five innings, with Cal State 
San Bernardino coming out on top 
12-4.

UCSD, which is 15-7 overall on 
the season, is only 5-5 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association games, 
a sign that the team has excelled against 
nonconference teams but has not been 
able to carry that same determination 
against league opponents. 

“As a team we need to change our 
approach to conference games,” Habib 
said. “We’ve allowed ourselves to play 
the other teams’ game and as a result 
we play tight. We just need to play ball 
the way we know how and not let the 
other team affect us at all.” 

Next weekend the Tritons will 
return home to host CCAA rival 
Sonoma State University for a four-
game series starting Feb 7.

“I expect the girls to push a little 
more at practice this week so that 
when it comes game time we’ll be 
ready,” Lukk said. “Confidence, execu-
tion and focus is what we need to 
see next weekend, and I know we’ll 
see it.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Taking 
care of business on the road, the 
UCSD women’s basketball team 
clinched a postseason home game by 
winning its last two regular season 
contests, which earns it the third seed 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association tournament. The Tritons 
posted a 74-50 victory over Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Feb. 28 before fin-
ishing off their regular season with a 
63-47 win over San Francisco State on 
Feb. 29. The two wins push UCSD’s 
CCAA record to 14-6 and its overall 
record to 22-8 as the Tritons enter the 
postseason.

The Tritons and Gators played 
a contested first period in San 
Francisco. The Tritons opened up 
the scoring with a jump shot from 
senior guard Alexis Mezzetta, who 
played all 40 minutes of the game 
for UCSD. The Gators started off 
well, keeping up with scores from 
junior forward Michelle Osier and 
senior forward Meaghan Noud for 
the Tritons’ scoring to take a 12-8 
lead over UCSD with 15:15 left in 
the half.

UCSD took the lead back with a 
three-pointer from Noud with 11:20 
left in the half to give the Tritons a 
16-14 lead. The Tritons used a bal-
anced offensive attack to finish the 
first half strongly and take a lead 
into halftime. With 54 seconds left 
in the period, senior center Alexis 
Gaskin converted on a layup to give 

the Tritons the lead at 33-23. San 
Francisco got the last basket of the 
half to send both teams into the 
locker room with the Tritons nurs-
ing a 33-25 lead.

The Tritons picked up right 
where they left off in the second 
half, opening the period with three 
consecutive baskets from sopho-
more forward Erin Noonan, Osier 
and Gaskin. Staying with their start-
ers for most of the game, the Tritons 
extended their lead to 14 points after 
a three-point basket from Noonan 
with 14:04 left in the half. 

San Francisco State battled back 
to cut UCSD’s lead to seven points 
with 5:20 left in regulation, but 
seven points would be the closest 
the Gators would get to the Tritons. 
The Tritons did not let up late in the 
second half, getting scores from all 
over the court and taking a 63-47 
victory over the Gators. 

Only seven Tritons played in the 
contest with the bench logging just 
12 minutes. The starters took care 
of business against the Gators, with 
Osier leading the way with 21 points 
and 10 rebounds. Noud came close 
to a double-double with 15 points 
and eight rebounds, and Noonan 
added 12 points for the Tritons. 

“Rebounding was really the key 
in this game,” head coach Charity 
Elliott said. “We outrebounded 
them [51 to 38].”

These two teams will face off 
on March 4 at RIMAC Arena 
for the first game of the CCAA 
Championship Tournament. The 

Tritons and Gators are the No. 3 
and No. 8 seeds in the tournament, 
respectively. 

“It’s very important getting that 
home game,” Noud said. “It’s obvi-
ously an advantage getting a break 
from traveling, but it’s also a confi-
dence builder.”

UCSD’s win over Cal State 
Monterey Bay one night earlier 
helped the Tritons clinch home-
court advantage in that first post-
season game. UCSD took its second

SOFTBALL — After losing only 
four times over its first 18 games 
this season, the UCSD softball team 
lost three out of four games in a 
weekend series against Cal State San 
Bernardino. The Tritons were swept 
in the series opening doublehead-
er on Feb. 29, losing 4-3 and 10-1, 
before finally winning 4-3 on March 
1. UCSD was not able to escape the 
weekend with a series split and lost 
the final game 12-4. 

In the opening game, senior left-
hander Melissa Ward gave up only 
five hits over six innings of work, 
but unfortunately three of the five 
went for Cal State San Bernardino 
homeruns. The team ace showed a 
very uncharacteristic lack of con-
trol while walking a season-high 
six batters to go along with picking 
up three strikeouts. Even with the 

unusual performance, Ward limited 
the Coyotes to only four runs, but the 
UCSD offense could only use its eight 
hits, three of which came off fresh-
man shortstop Sarah Woofter’s bat, to 
get three runs across the board. 

The Tritons used a clutch two-
out, two-RBI double from senior 
third baseman Jenny Maze to ignite 
a three-run third inning and claim a 
3-2 lead over the Coyotes. That lead 
would hold until the bottom of the 
sixth when Cal State San Bernardino 
stepped up to the plate with some 
late-game theatrics of its own. With 
two down and a runner on first, 
freshman pinch-hitter Priscilla Curiel 
drove a Ward pitch out of the park for 
a heartbreaking two-run homerun 
that gave the Coyotes a 4-3 lead. That 
lead would stick, as the Tritons went 
down in order in the top of the sev-
enth to end the game.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD 
men’s basketball team suffered a dis-
appointing end to their regular sea-
son, losing on the road to Cal State 
Monterey Bay and San Francisco State. 
The Otters defeated UCSD, 84-66, on 
Feb. 28. The Tritons then fell by a 73-
64 final score to the Gators on Feb. 29. 
UCSD ends the regular season with a 
15-11 overall mark, the program’s best 
since moving to Division II, and an 11-
9 mark in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association action. The Tritons, in 
a five-way tie for third place in the 
CCAA, have been seeded at No. 7 in 
the upcoming CCAA tournament after 
head-to-head tiebreakers involving the 
five teams were taken into account.

Head coach Chris Carlson’s Tritons 
will look to end their season-high five-
game losing streak and extend their 
season as they travel to Cal State San 
Bernardino for a CCAA tournament 
quarterfinals game on March 4.

After leading the Gators early twice, 
first following two freethrows by junior 
guard Kelvin Kim and later off a three-
pointer from senior guard Clint Allard, 
the Tritons went cold from the field 
offensively. UCSD scored only eight 
total points in the first 10:44 of the 
game, with San Francisco State able to 
extend to a double-digit advantage. The 
Tritons trailed by as much as 13 in the 
first half before getting a much-needed 
spark from the bench: Junior guard 
Andrew Hatch scored seven straight 
UCSD points, reducing the deficit to 
seven. The Gators would settle for an 
eight-point lead at the break after hold-
ing the Tritons to only two freethrows 
through the final two and a half min-
utes of the first half.

Junior forward Darryl Lawlor 
and sophomore guard Jordan Lawley 
helped pull UCSD to within two points 
early in the second half, with a Lawlor 
three-pointer and two consecutive 
jumpers from Lawley, leading an 8-2 
Triton run in the first 3:35 of the sec-
ond half. While never trailing by more 
than 11 points through the rest of the 
half and staying within two posses-
sions for most of the game, the Tritons 
would be unable to tie or take the 
lead. UCSD struggled mightily from 
the field, shooting a season-low 28.8 
percent and connecting on only 5-of-
23 from three-point range. The Gators 
shot just above 40 percent from the 
field, but provided much of their scor-
ing cushion from the freethrow line, 
connecting on 28 of an incredible 35 
shots from the charity stripe.

“We did a better job of being physical 
than we have, but we just didn’t always 
do so legally,” said Allard. “The refs 
called it tight the whole way through. 
All you can ask for is consistency, and 
neither team really adjusted.”

Hatch led the Tritons in scoring 
with a career-high 18 points on 5-of-9 
shooting from the field and 8-of-10 
from the freethrow line. Allard was the 
only other Triton scoring double-digits, 
with 16 points, while also grabbing four 
rebounds and dishing out a game-high 
three assists.

The Tritons jumped out to an early 
10-2 lead against Cal State Monterey 
Bay, with Lawley and junior forward 
Henry Patterson each scoring four 
points in the first four minutes of the 
game. The Otters would respond with 
their own 10-0 run, taking the lead 
at the 14:37 mark. Patterson added 
another layup off a pass from junior 
guard Alan Husted, then recorded a 
steal, leading to a Husted three-pointer 
that regained the lead for the Tritons. 
The teams would be tied and exchange 
the lead twice more before the Otters 
went ahead for good, extending to 
a double-digit lead with under eight 
minutes to play in the first half, as 
UCSD got no closer than nine before 
intermission.

Trailing by double-digits in the sec-
ond half, the Tritons would again get a 
jolt from their reserves. Junior forward 
Shane Poppen scored eight points in 
a five-and-a-half minute stretch as the 
Tritons found themselves down by only 
two points, 55-53, with 10:29 remain-
ing in the game. Cal State Monterey 
Bay’s Juston Willis stunted the UCSD 
momentum with a three-pointer that 
signaled the beginning of the end. The 
Otters went on a 15-2 run over the next 
six minutes that put the game away, 
with the Tritons trailing by as much as 
21 in the game’s final minutes.

“During the comeback we were 
getting defensive stops leading to our 
offense of attacking the basket aggres-
sively,” said Allard, who scored eight 
points with three rebounds and two 
assists in the loss. “Once [Cal State 
Monterey Bay] got a couple buckets on 
us, we got away from what had been 
successful to get us back in the game for 
some reason, and we were not effective 
guarding the dribbler one-on-one.”

Lawley scored a team-high 18 points 
and grabbed five rebounds in only 15 
minutes of play, while Patterson added 
12 points and tied Lawlor for the team-
high with seven boards. Poppen scored 
nine with five rebounds and Hatch 
added eight points off the bench.

UCSD, which was tied for the con-
ference lead just over two weeks ago, 
will now face No. 13 and CCAA sec-
ond seed Cal State San Bernardino 
on March 4. The Tritons and Coyotes 
split the season series, with each squad 
winning at home. If successful in their 
first-round matchup, the Tritons will 
advance to the CCAA semifinals on 
March 7, again in San Bernardino.

“[Carlson’s] message was we are 
coming up on fourth season, with pre-
season, non-conference and conference 
being the first three seasons,” Allard 
said. “Regardless of seeding, we have to 
look at it as a fresh start, where every 
game is the most important game of 
the season.”
