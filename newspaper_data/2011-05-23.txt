Students, Senator 
Oppose Regent 
Appointed by Gov. 
Schwarzenegger

Students could be charged an $8 quarterly 
fee if a referendum to save the Center for 
Library and Instructional Computing Services 
— known by most as CLICS — is put on the 
Spring 2012 A.S. Elections ballot.

Muir College Council Chair Jessie Rosales 
is heading a task-force committee with 
representatives from the six college councils 
and members of A.S. Council to examine the 
feasibility of saving CLICS, or maintaining 
it as a study space for students.   About 15 
people from various college councils and A.S. 
Council have expressed interest in the task-
force committee, Rosales said.

According to Rosales, the annual budget 
to sustain CLICS — including its ACMS 
computer lab — is approximately $600,000. 
Rosales believes this revenue can be created 
with a new, $8-per-quarter student fee. If A.S. 
Council approves Rosales’ proposal, it will 
be placed on the Spring 2012 A.S. Elections 
ballot. If passed, it would go into place — and 
CLICS would reopen —  during the 2012-13 
academic year.  

Currently, CLICS is scheduled to close 
after finals in June 2011. 

Rosales said the task-force committee 
plans to submit a CLICS proposal —  which 
will cover maintenance, security, rental and 
budgeting factors —  to the Department of 
Academic Affairs by the end of the summer. 
According to Rosales, the Academic Affairs 
Department already has four proposals to use 
CLICS for office spaces.

“The referendum is my idea right now,” 
Rosales said. “The point of the task force is to 
come up with other ideas.”

Rosales explained that alternatives to 
the referendum are being considered. One 
option is to turn the library into a student-
run study space, similar to a co-op. He said 
that operating CLICS without the ACMS 
computers costs $370,000 annually.

“I want to make sure the administration 
knows that [the issue is] not dead,” he said. 
“Students are still really concerned about 
this issue. It seems that the administration is 
taking the students’ voices for granted.”

According to Rosales, Acting Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Academic Planning and 
Resources David Miller said it is doubtful the 

administration would consider a student fee 
proposal.

“I consider it as a slap in the face because it’s 
just shutting down the student voice,” Rosales 
said. “We really want this force to be known 
so that [it] pressures the administration and 
tells them they shouldn’t be the ones making 
the sole decisions.”

Current library committee undergraduate 
representative and former A.S. Campuswide 
Senator Anish Bhayani said he doubts 
the administration would approve such a 
referendum.

“The administration won’t just hand it to 
the students just because they have the money 
to support it,” Bhayani said. “The percentage 
of students who use CLICS does not suffice a 
full referendum.”

Bhayani said he is concerned the 
referendum would require A.S. to deal with 
issues they are not prepared to address 
such as legal issues, worker training, 
workers’ compensation, benefits among 
other areas of managing a business.

Suspect Attempts to Kidnap Student
U CSD police are conducting an investigation after a suspect — who has yet to be found — attempted to kidnap 
a UCSD student just west of Geisel Library on 
Friday, May 20 around 8 p.m. 

According to an all-campus emergency 
alert from UCSD police, the student-aged male 
approached the female victim from behind, 
placed a paper bag over her head and attempted 
to drag her off the pathway between the bushes 
on the side of the library closest to Thurgood 
Marshall College. 

The unidentified victim was able to break 
free from the assailant and escape. 

The suspect is approximately 5’9”, medium-

built, light-skinned with curly brown hair and 
was last seen wearing blue jeans. The suspect 
fled on foot.

Multiple alerts were sent to students through 
the Triton Alert System around 10 p.m. the same 
night. 

According to UCSD spokesperson Rex 
Graham, no new developments have been made 
since Friday.

The UCSD police department could not be 
reached for comment. No arrests have been 
made.

State Sen. Leland Yee (D-San Francisco) and 
the UC Student Association are calling for the 
UC Board of Regents to reject the appointment of 
prospective UC Regent David Crane. 

Crane was appointed by former Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in December 2010. If confirmed 
by the state senate, David Crane will hold his 
position as regent until March 1, 2012. Being 
a regent is an unpaid, volunteer position. 
According to the San Jose Mercury News, Crane’s 
confirmation hearing has not been scheduled. 

Crane said he became interested in the position 
due to his interest in improving California higher 
education.

“It’s the most important thing someone can do 
if they want to improve the lives of Californians, 
to make sure we have the highest education 
available,” Crane said.

Since his appointment, Crane has faced 
disapproval from UCSA due to his political ties 
with the former governor — Crane was a special 
adviser for jobs and economic growth since 
2004   — and statements he has made against 
collective bargaining. 

UCSA and Yee — who is leading the charge to 
prevent Crane’s confirmation —  have expressed 
concerns that Crane does not appreciate collective 
bargaining rights for university and public 
employees due to a Feb. 27 op-ed he wrote in the 
San Francisco Chronicle.

“Collective bargaining is a good thing when 
it’s needed to equalize power, but when public 
employees already have that equality because of 
civil service protections, collective bargaining 
in the public sector serves to reduce benefits for 
citizens and to raise costs for taxpayers,” Crane 
wrote.

According to a UCSA press release, the 
organization was not informed of Crane’s 
appointment. 

“It is deeply troubling that we were not

Discovery of  Sex Hormone Yields Clues Into Disease Treatments
SCIENCE AnD TECHNOLOGY

By Regina Ip
Senior Staff Writer

School of Medicine researchers 
have discovered a sex hormone that 
prevents inflammation in the brain. 
According to cellular and molecular 
medicine professor Christopher 
Glass, this newly identified hormone, 
called ADIOL, can uncover how 
inflammatory responses work in 
neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Parkinson’s disease, HIV-associated 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

“We were interested in trying 
to discover new ways to inhibit 
inflammation in the brain [so we] 
looked into whether the drugs were 
mimicking activities of natural 
hormones that might be in the brain,” 
Glass said. “We went searching 
and we ended up finding a natural 
steroid called ADIOL that has many 
properties of drugs we tested.”

Cells of the sex hormones 
androgen and estrogen eventually 
mature into these newly discovered 

ADIOL cells, which regulate 
inflammation caused by microglia 
cells that help the central nervous 
system respond to infections and 
injuries.  

Microglia cells in the nervous 
system are watchdogs that look 
out for invading microbes or tissue 
damage. When they find something, 
these cells start up an inflammatory 
response in the immune system and 
begin to repair tissues. However, if 
the inflammatory response is not 
controlled or continues for a long 
period, neurons can be damaged or 
die.

Researchers found that this 
microglia inflammation is regulated 
by the production of ADIOL, which 
tells supporting cells to ease up 
and return to their resting state. 
The hormone works by binding to 
estrogen receptor beta to generate an 
anti-inflammatory response to the 
two cell types in the nervous system. 
As a result, estrogen cannot bind and 
can get in the way of ADIOL

“[We] tested a large series of 
synthetic molecules that can bind 
to this estrogen receptor beta and 
we found that some of them were 
blocking inflammation,” Glass said.

This discovery can indicate 
that women are more prone to 
inflammatory diseases like multiple 
sclerosis because they have more 
estrogen in their bodies. In addition, 
it can explain some of the severe 
effects of administering estrogen 
to the brain for post-menopausal 
women.

“Many aspects of inflammation 
one can observe in multiple sclerosis 
are also see in other types of 
neurodegenerative diseases,” Glass 
said. “People are beginning to see 
that inflammation is contributing to 
the severity of the disease, so an 
idea — and it’s not just our idea, 
lots of people have this idea — is 
that by inhibiting inflammation in 
the brain, we might be able to slow 
down the development of these very 
debilitating degenerative diseases.”

Levels of the hormone in the body 
can be helpful in predicting responses 
to drugs that mimic its actions.

Glass and his team of researchers 
will continue to study ADIOL further, 
such as finding out how much is 
naturally produced in each individual 
and discerning the relationship 
between brain inflammation and 
neurodegenerative disease.

informed about this decision,” UC 
Santa Cruz student Nelson Cortez 
wrote in the press release. 

According to Yee, writing on 
the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
website, hundreds of UC employees, 
community members, and other 
public employees protested against 
Crane on March 4 in San Francisco.

Crane said that many of the 
criticisms are unfounded. 

“I graduated from UC Hastings 
[and] started working at $5 an 
hour 30 years ago,” he said. “I don’t 
see why a person that started at a 
UC, went through this, and was 
financially successful is a bad thing 
[for the Regents board]. I am saying 
that since the state is reducing 
funding to the UCs, we need to take 
steps to ensure the affordability and 
accessibility of higher education.”

Despite UCSA comments, Crane 
said he still believes students should 
be involved in the bureaucratic 

aspect of the UC system.
“Why is more of California’s 

money being spent on prison 
guards than for the UC system?” 
Crane said. 

UCSA President and UC Santa 
Cruz junior Claudia Magaña could 
not be reached for comment.

UCSA Organizing and 
Communications Director Christine 
Byon refused to comment.

√  Yes, this is a safe campus
√  No, better safe than sorry
√  I did until this incident

By now, it’s hopefully safe to say that I survived Judgment Day 2011. It isn’t much of a 
shock: the Book of Wikipedia clearly 
outlines the history of Apocalypse 
predictions, which far predates 
minister Harold Camping’s own 
$100-million premonition (and, 
somewhat remarkably, the 92-year-
old minister himself). Camping 
wasn’t the first to cry “rapture!” 
— an abridged history includes a 
Baptist minister proclaiming the end 
in 1844 and a “Korean group” call-
ing it in 1992. Sir Isaac Newton’s still 
holding out for 2060. 

I’m not one of the untold 
thousands who prepared for the 
worst on Saturday. Some maxed 
out credit cards to embark on the 
cross-country road trip they’d long 
put off; others, like New York City 
transit worker Robert Fitzpatrick, 
depleted over $100,000 in savings 
to help spread Camping’s word. I 
didn’t even bother to set my iPhone 
to Britney Spears’s “Till the World 
Ends.” 

All the billboards on the I-5 
advertising Judgment Day (many of 
which boast a gold seal that reads: 
“The Bible Guarantees It”!) did, 
however, get me thinking about 
what I might do were the end actu-
ally imminent. Would I head north 
to say a final goodbye to my family 
in the Bay Area? The option’s prob-
ably the most honorable. Like a 
solider heading to battle, I could kiss 
my baby siblings a tearful goodbye 
and tell my mother to be brave for 
me — we’d be better off on the other 
side. (Or she would: I might tip at 
Starbucks and help the occasional 
old lady with her groceries, but I 
can’t claim innocence of some of the 
kookier parts of Leviticus. Whoever 
authored that bit about shellfish 
probably never had a lobster bur-
rito.)

But Camping, before going into 
hiding on the big day, was adamant 
that 6 p.m. local time would mark 
the end everywhere, and there’s 
never any telling how long it might 
take to get through L.A. I wouldn’t 
want to chance traffic on the drive 
north: The thought of meeting my 
maker at the Kettleman City Jack in 
the Box isn’t my idea of a graceful 
way out; I wouldn’t consider curly 
fries and a diet coke the last supper 
of dreams, either. 

So home’s out. And there may be 
a handful of cameraphone worthy 
natural sights in San Diego, but no 
slice of coastline — no matter how 
calm the breeze or memory-searing 
the public nudity — has really col-
ored my time here as much as a 
handful of rabblerousing coeds in 
the second-grimiest corner of the 
Old Student Center. They’re the 
ones who have initiated a thousand 
spontaneous dance parties and as 
many 2 a.m. burrito runs, and who, 
rapture or not, I won’t be seeing 
much of after this quarter. Given 
the circumstances, I can’t imagine a 
happier ending than dancing ‘til the 
world ends with them. (And if, as 
Newton predicted, I’ve got another 
five decades of bad pop and good 
company ahead of me, I’m not com-
plaining, either.)

School Bench CensorshipQUICKTAKES

The American Civil Liberties Union is accus-ing La Jolla High School officials of violat-
ing the California Education Code’s free speech 
policy by removing student-painted messages 
that were supportive of the Iranian anti-govern-
ment movement — but it was completely within 
the school’s jurisdiction to do so. 

Federal judicial decree states that each school 
may “establish reasonable time, place and man-
ner regulations regarding oral and/or written 
expression of ideas.” LJHS has clearly established 
that non-campus related student expression 
belongs on the bulletin boards located adjacent 
to the benches.

The school also states that all written matter 
should identify the student group responsible for 
the posting, as well as display the date of post-
ing. The students of the Persian Club — who 
were responsible for the postings — violated all 
of these rules and should not attack the removal 
as an infringement upon their rights. 

According to the LJHS Student Behavior 
Contract that each student must read and sign 
during registration, the school has every right to 
set free speech parameters. 

Students have the right to not sign the con-
tract, but this will forfeit their right to attend La 
Jolla High School. 

It is important that the school takes these 
cautionary measures to ban controversial poli-
tics so that students feel safe from any aggressive 
political behavior or strongly opposing opinions. 
By removing the postings, school officials were 
merely following the established rules and pro-
moting a non-hostile learning environment for 
students.

Free Speech Rightfully Curtailed

The latest controversy to occur in our neigh-borhood comes from La Jolla High School, 
where the administration censored the messages 
“Freedom for Iran” and “Down with Dictator” that 
students painted on a bench.  
       The ACLU is suing the San Diego Union 
School District, demanding that it surrender its 
authority to eradicate any message it deems too 
inappropriate, as this violates the students’ right 
to be heard. ACLU activism aside, this is a prime 
educational opportunity.  
         If students care enough to paint these opin-
ions, the administration has the obligation to 
utilize the students’ freedom of expression as an 
opportunity to teach.

According to the LHJS conduct code, the senior 
benches are intended for messages of school spirit 
and birthday wishes. Because of these established 
rules and federal law, the school is within its rights 
to censor the benches. But some impassioned stu-
dents wanted their impact to extend beyond peppy 
school-spirited messages. These attempts at peer 
education shouldn’t simply be eradicated when 
they obviously concern an issue that students care 
about. Yasamin Elahi, the senior who painted the 
messages, said, “I never did any of this to get atten-
tion or hurt my school… I wrote the messages so 
kids would realize that there is a lot going on out-
side the world [of] La Jolla that they live in.” 

The benches could have easily highlighted the 
controversy and provided an ideal point to start 
a real discussion about current events. When stu-
dents so publicly displayed their need to show their 
peers what’s happening outside of campus halls, 
the administration at LJHS should have taken 
advantage of the opportunity to educate.

The American Civil Liberties Union has once again gone too far by suing a school for 
upholding its rules regarding political expression. 
As important as it is to preserve our rights and 
liberties, it is also essential not to be overly accu-
satory when it comes to pointing out free speech 
violations.

At La Jolla High School, students painted mes-
sages criticizing the Iranian government on school 
benches, which were quickly removed by admin-
istrators. The ACLU filed a lawsuit last Monday 
against the school district, fighting for the mes-
sages to remain painted on the benches.

This isn’t the first time the ACLU has been the 
subject of controversy. In the past, the organiza-
tion defended groups such as North American 
Man/Boy Love Association, a pedophile advocacy 
group, as well as a church group that picketed 
military funerals with inflammatory signs. The 
ACLU defends so many questionably appropriate 
free speech cases that it is hard to take this recent 
case seriously. 

The group’s most recent claim that Principal 
Dana Shelburne’s decision to remove the political 
messages violates students’ free speech is outright 
misguided. In cases such as Bethel School District 
v. Fraser (1986), the Supreme Court has clearly 
established that school officials can stifle student 
speech if it violates school rules.  

According to the La Jolla High School’s code of 
conduct, the school’s “senior benches” are designed 
for non-political purposes, while other spaces on 
campus are available to voice political opinions. 
And as long as there are specific places for political 
expression at the school, there’s little chance the 
ACLU will win its newest lawsuit.

A student work group shortens and simplifies UCSD’s Student Conduct Code for the first 

time in three years to enhance readership and awareness.

It’s been three years since the Student Conduct Code was last revised, and a whopping 33 years since anyone 
actually read it. The Student Conduct 
Code Revision Workgroup is betting 
that the widely ignored page-turner 
needed student authors to get student 
readers, and they just might be onto 
something. By truncating half the code 
and gathering input from 27 on-campus 
groups, the members have finally gotten 
the student body to give a damn about 
what’s expected of them. 

The workgroup was formed in May 
2009 by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue, to confront negative 
findings by the Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction Committee. 
The 2005 report lists 16 campus issues to 
tackle and — surprise, surprise — half 
pertain to UCSD’s perpetually dormant 
social scene. One reason for this is illus-
trated in No. 2: a “too controlled, overly 
regulated” residential life. 

Tenants think Residential Security 
Officers only want to bust up extracur-
riculars and ruin Triton spirit. One 
survey even described the job of the 
Residential Security Officers as to prac-
tically “put their ears on the outside 
of the door to see if there is a party 
going on.” To combat this authoritative, 
detached view of administration, the 
23-person workgroup is enlisting the 
help of student organizations, councils, 
and the general student body so they 
could better understand the standards 
to which they are held. Administrators 

won’t ever totally “get” the student body, 
but it’s nice to see they at least want us 
on the same page.

And with this more accessible, 
stripped-down treatment, students will 
actually be on that page. No longer is an 
LSAT study guide required to decipher 
the once legally minded code. It now 
flows in an outline better suited for 
those seeking a particular paragraph. 
Sanctions and the appeals process are 
now clearly labeled brochure-style 
instead of buried in clauses that more 
closely resembled the California penal 
code. As a trade-off for not speaking 
in legal jargon, the draft defines key 
terminology at the beginning to keep 
everyone on the same page — or rather, 
15 pages. This simpler lexicon effectively 
halved the old, legally verbose 30-page 
code that was likely the greatest deter-
rent to student readership and, in turn, 
knowing the regulations RSOs so enthu-
siastically enforce.

But the drastic shortening goes too 
far when it comes to the good stuff: sex, 
drugs and porn. Instead of explicitly 
stating each possible violation, the new 
code refers the reader to other policies 
(e.g. Sexual Harassment, Alcohol Policy 
14.16, Academic Computing & Media 
Services Acceptable Use Policy, etc.). 
Fragmenting this information across 
multiple sources was intended to omit 
reiterated points, but students shouldn’t

Conduct Code Needs Facelift Beyond Changing Legal Jargon

Dear Editor,
I am writing to protest the UCSD 

Guardian’s decision to reject 
our ad titled “The Palestinians’ 
Case Against Israel is Based on a 
Genocidal Lie,” which also appeared 
last week in the New York Times. 
This ad exposes the Palestinian case 
against Israel for what it is. 

Israel is not “occupied 
Palestine.” Israel cannot be occu-
pying “Palestine” because Israel 
was created out of the ruins of the 
Turkish empire. The Turks are not 
Arabs. There never was a political 
entity, state or nation called Palestine 
in the Middle East. The nations of 
Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq were 
also created out of the land that had 
been controlled by the Turks for 400 
years, but no one protests that they 
are illegally occupying the land.

The Guardian’s censorship of 
our ad is unconscionable for a uni-
versity paper. The purpose of this 
suppression of our free speech is 
to appease the campus enemies of 
the only democracy in the Middle 
East. Shame on the Guardian for this 
betrayal of the most basic principles 
of a free press.

National Campus Director, 
Students for Academic Freedom

Dear Editor,
I tried to read the Guardian’s 

“Censorship Wrong Way 
to Protect Kids” while sitting at 
a computer terminal at the Point 
Loma Branch of the San Diego 
Public Library, but a program 
installed by the branch librarian 
froze it up. 

I asked that the desk clerk to lift 
the program. 

He did so but asked my name 
first. He said it was the policy. I 
gave him my name; but when I 
asked for his in turn he gave me 
only his first name — Steven — 
and then thrust his nametag into 
his pocket. 

The supervisor walked away 
when I asked to speak with her.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Ad Censorship Betrayed  
Freedom of  Press 

ThE liTTlE rinTrAh By Eileen Shi

be forced into a scavenger hunt to 
piece together how they broke the 
code, what policy they breached and 
back to the code to determine the 
next step. All of the loose articles can 
ultimately be consolidated into one 
exhaustive piece while still avoiding 
the Moby Dick-length that discour-
aged students from reading it.

This isn’t the first time the 
Student Conduct Code has been 
pared down for the sake of simplic-
ity. In a 2001 review, a similar work 
group decided the use of lawyers 
for administrative hearings was 
not constitutionally protected and 
consequently nixed it. Even then-
director of Student Legal Services 
Nick Aguilar admitted that attor-

neys “tend to be ineffective in the 
administrative setting.” The right to 
student advocates (now called advis-
ers) was maintained, letting students 
enlist the help of peers in proceed-
ings without giving them extra-
constitutional rights. With each of 
these modifications, the code erases 
a sense of formality that did noth-
ing but complicate legal affairs that 
students felt were already working 
against them.

Apart from the much-needed 
Cliffs-Notes makeover, the appeals 
process has been slightly modified. 
Previously, the choice to uphold or 
dismiss a challenged decision would 
be left up to the relevant college’s 
provost, and the entire council of six 
provosts would only gather to hear 

an appeal concerning more than 
one college. The new draft would 
enlist the council of provosts for 
all appeals, not just intercollegiate 
disputes. While we could observe 
a longer turnaround time for pro-
ceedings, it’s outweighed by the new 
pressure for provosts to find consen-
sus on issues that impact students 
directly. Any time administrators 
from the six colleges convene is an 
opportunity to get in touch with 
issues that affect the greater campus. 
For students, this means preventing 
violations from being repeated and 
a closer relationship with those pro-
vosts whom most of us never meet.

We all know how La Jolla residents can be, and many of the city’s more upscale restaurants (like 
Whisknladle or Azul) are pretentious enough to deter even the most determined of college students. 

If you’ve ever felt this way, Prepkitchen’s got your back.
Envisioned as a more laid-back (but still delicious) alternative to Chef 

Ryan Johnston’s original restaurant, Whisknladle, Prepkitchen is located 
within an unassuming cluster of buildings on Fay Avenue, 10 minutes away 
from campus in downtown La Jolla. 

Prepkitchen’s menu — inspired by Julia Child’s assertion that cooking 
“good food from fresh ingredients” should be valued above all else — is 
a remarkable balance of wholesome comfort food and daring, forward-
focused cuisine. 

A prime example is their Asparagus Tagliatelle ($16.50). Though the 
dish’s combination of house-made ricotta cheese, roasted garlic tagliatelle, 
asparagus and cream sauce is nothing groundbreaking, Prepkitchen’s atten-
tion to ingredients and freshness makes the dish a surprisingly delightful 
update of a traditional Italian meal. Similarly striking is the restaurant’s 

Spinach, Bacon and Apple Salad ($11.25), served with blue cheese and walnuts. Though this com-
bination of flavors is far from new (McDonald’s serves something similar), Prepkitchen’s carefully-
sourced ingredients (most vegetables are only served when in season, and both of Johnston’s restau-
rants make use of farm-to-table produce) make for a salad that’s both marvelously crisp and a potent 
combination of the savory and sweet. 

This approach is evident in almost every aspect of Prepkitchen. Their bread tastes unbelievably 
fresh, and upon being seated, guests are served a glass of delicately seasoned cucumber water and a 
plate containing a wide variety of olives. Furthermore, the staff is relentlessly friendly and unusually 
knowledgeable about the (often baffling) variety of unique ingredients on Prepkitchen’s menu.

There’s a reason this place sounds like a marijuana dispensary. Located 20 minutes 
away in downtown San Diego, Hash House a go go is every stoner’s dream: the por-
tions are giant, the recipes are unique and the food is just plain amazing.

The restaurant describes itself as “twisted farm food” —  a motto reflected in their 
best meals, their “House Hashes” and meat scrambles: With hearty, rustic dishes that 
are new takes on the traditional breakfast fare, Hash House’s grub is perfect for the 

foodie farmhand or gourmand lum-
berjack. 

From roasted chicken with garlic, asparagus and rose-
mary to hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion and 
Swiss scrambles, their breakfast menu items don’t sound 
all that, well, breakfast-y, but they’re 
filling and gut-satisfying. 

Though they have lighter and 
sweeter options, like French toast 
or sundried tomato, basil and goat 
cheese scrambles, the meat-heavy 
meals are the most popular items on 
the menu. Plus, in case that wasn’t 

enough, almost everything comes 
with potatoes and a side of bis-

cuits, with several canteens 
of fresh strawberry pre-
serves per table.

The Hillcrest space is 
clean, open and modern, 
but you won’t be looking around much when the gargantuan 
meals are set in front of you. Meals are a bit pricey, as break-
fast meals range from $8 to $17, but stay mostly in the $12 to 
$15 range. However, you’re sure to have a ton of leftovers that 
are still tasty post-microwave — giving you two-meals-in-one, 
unless you really are a lumberjack. 

And if you somehow still haven’t had enough, take comfort in 
the fact that Hash House serves breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner.

It may look like the seafood section of your local Ralphs, but El Pescador Fish Market — located in downtown La Jolla, a short 10-minute drive 
from campus — can dish out the most amazing fresh seafood salads and sandwiches.

Despite its popularity, the restaurant only has five tables, so plan on take-out to avoid waiting awkwardly with your food for a place to sit. 
Though El Pescador is an order-at-the-counter joint, its menu is vast. The laundry list of choices come from a wide variety of seafood ingredients 
(thresher shark, yellowtail, swordfish and Alaskan salmon, to name a few) plucked from the display case in front of you. 

Definitely try the local char-grilled halibut sandwich ($9.95). The halibut, far from being the overcooked, rubbery mess it can so often be, 
shatters into a billion buttery, fishy shards when you take your first bite. It’s paired with a light torta roll, crisp vegetables and fresh, ripe avocado 
($1.00 extra, but absolutely essential) that complement the fish well. The only improvement would be a fresher, toasted roll —  ciabbata, perhaps. 

If you are looking for lighter fare, go for their combo seafood salad ($9.50). A crisp, crunchy blend of lettuce, tomatoes and red onions, the 
salad is topped with fresh, sweet chunks of crabmeat and bay shrimp. Finished off with the better half of a ripe avocado (again, an extra charge) 
and your choice of vinaigrette, it just might become your favorite salad. 

Another favorite is their oysters ($1.50 each), which are briny and sweet — as they should be. Whether it is your first or hundredth, slurp it 
down either by itself or topped with a dash of the in-house lemon, hot sauce and onion-vinegar mignonette.

If you’re not too lazy to drive roughly 15 minutes to Convoy when Pho La Jolla beckons from around the corner, Phuong Trang offers 
Pho La Jolla prices with a classier atmosphere — and without our nearby joint’s mediocre broth and signature clumpy noodles. 

The restaurant, located near an Asian bakery in one of Convoy’s endless strip malls, is deceptively advertised as Vietnamese and 
Chinese food, but its 200+-item menu provides almost exclusively Vietnamese options, and the place is best known for its eggrolls, 
vermicelli and pho.

The aforementioned eggrolls are the best option from the appetizer menu. The noodles and vegetables are fresh, the outside is flaky 
and the fish sauce complements the mix of pork, mint and cilantro. In contrast, the spring rolls aren’t hugely different from the pre-
packaged kind you can get at TapEx, and don’t bother getting the Vietnamese crepe; the “crisp rice flower crepe” with shrimp, pork and 
vegetables might sound appealing, but it turns out to be an enormous, hollow and fried egg sculpture with the odd-looking piece of 
pork or mung bean embedded inside. 

But while the crepe is a disappointment, Phuong Trang’s vermicelli noodle bowls are a high point of the menu and one of the most 
affordable options available (around $8), and portions are enormous. The noodles are a bit stickier than usual, but they’re well done 
with a strong flavor of lemongrass and stir-fried vegetables that doesn’t need fish sauce to be flavorful. The bowls come with chicken, 
beef or shrimp, but the servers don’t charge extra for adding another meat onto your order. 

The trend of big portions extends to the pho, which has flavorful broth and comes with chicken and beef meatball options. The more 
adventurous (and more wealthy) can also choose the seven-course beef dish, or opt to make their own spring rolls. The servers will 

bring a mini-stove with plates of raw meat, vegetables and rice paper, all of which you cook or assemble yourself at the table. Aside from being great fun, 
it also ensures that the ingredients are done exactly to your liking and/or level of culinary skill.

Phuong Trang isn’t noted for its service, but the waiters are usually prompt, even if they don’t look overjoyed to take your order. And the state of the 
bathrooms can strike fear into a patron’s heart, but it’s only little worse than similar dives, and the food is much, much better.

lEISURE MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

Save for all the tables and chairs, RA sushi, located 20 minutes from campus in downtown San Diego, 
is basically a hip nightclub. With bold black and red décor, loud top-40 jams and an exceptional 

happy hour every Monday through Saturday from 3 p.m. - 7 p.m. ($2 hot sake and $3 - $4 for 
well drinks and most beers), you’re pretty much guaranteed to get sloshed (or run into another 

patron who is). 
But RA is, first and foremost, a sushi joint (three cheers for high-class drunchies!) — 
and an excellent one at that. 

A house favorite is the filling and spicy Hot Mess ($13.50, but only $7 during 
happy hour) — crunchy rice balls, topped off with a mix of tender spicy king 

crab, baked and finished with a dash of jalapeno, cilantro and spicy sauce.  
The Viva Las Vegas Roll ($7) — Kani kama crab and cream cheese rolled 

in rice and seaweed, battered in a light coat of tempura and topped with 
smooth spicy tuna and drizzle of sweet eel sauce — is also a huge 

seller.
If that’s still too pricey, don’t fret — happy hour food starts 

at $2 with edamame (steamed soybeans dusted with salt and 
served with soy sauce), and sushi staples like California 

rolls ($4) and nigiri ($3 — slices of raw sushi on top 
of clumps of rice), as well as more unusual items 

like the Pineapple Cheese Wontons ($4 — crispy, 
lightly fried wontons filled with cream cheese, 

scallions and pineapple and served with a 
pineapple dipping sauce) and Tootsky 

Maki ($5 — a roll stuffed with Kani 
kama crab mix, shrimp, cucum-

ber and topped with crunchy 
tempura flakes and sweet eel 

sauce) come cheap.

THE ASIAN BISTRO

It’s 2 a.m. on Monday during finals week. You’re cracked out on Red Bull, you’ve just finished your paper on 
lit. theory and you’re starving. You’re also out of luck — In-N-Out closed its plastic neon-covered doors over 
an hour ago, and the thought of stomaching Burger King for the third time this week is, at best, nauseating.

Seeing how competition for the 3-a.m. crowd is pretty minimal, the Asian Bistro (formerly known as 
Jimmy Wong’s), could dish out roadkill and expect the residents of greater San Diego to stomach it, but they 
don’t. Though you’ll frequently find yourself barging into the restaurant at odd hours, the place is anything 
but a grimy dive — glass and cloth-covered tables line up in neat rows beside ornate red walls, decorated 
to match the Bistro’s Thai theme. The joint is small, but reservations (except during peak rush hours) are 
superfluous.

The Asian Bistro offers a spicy (adjustable to your taste), traditional, smooth and full-bodied red-chili-
infused yellow curry, with a healthy helping of meat (your choice of beef, chicken, pork, tofu, mixed veg-
etables, duck, shrimp or mixed seafood), potatoes, carrots, onions and a side of rice (all for $9.95, add $2 for 
duck, shrimp or mixed seafood.) Pair it with the Hedwig ($8.50) — six pieces of marinated shrimp wrapped 
in delicate, thin and crunchy fried egg noodles served with the sweet house special sauce — for a filling meal.

Best of all, the Bistro’s late-night specials will ensure you don’t break the bank satisfying your munchies 
(or drunchies); Mondays through Wednesdays, select entrees are $6.95 to $7.95 (this includes the aforemen-
tioned yellow curry) and certain starters are a cheap $3.95 for those who opt to dine in at the  restaurant.

A Café, as its too-obvious name implies, is deceptively incon-
spicuous: Though it’s tucked away in a drab Kearny Mesa strip 
mall (approximately 15 minutes away from campus), the restau-
rant offers a pocket-friendly alternative to the dreaded crispy 
chicken snack at the neighboring Tapioca Express. 

Entrees at the Hong Kong-style café range from $5 to $13, 
although the menu is small, and parking (within the same lot 
as Yogurt World and the aforementioned TapEx) is sometimes 
hard to find.

The joint — one of the very few like it in town — does best 
with Hong Kong café staples: Dishes that blend Cantonese 

cuisine with Western, Japanese and 
Southeast Asian influences, like pork 
chop with spaghetti ($8) and ham and 
egg with macaroni in soup ($5). 

Go for the moist and tender pork 
chop meal ($8) — the chef ’s special is 
well-seasoned with salt and pepper, a 
good complement with the side of rice 
and steamed soft vegetables. 

A favorite is shrimp with pineap-
ple in mayonnaise ($9) with a side of 
steamed rice. Mayonnaise might not 
sound appealing on anything but a 
sandwich, but the sauce is a standard 
that’s subtly used for a thick cover over 
the shrimp. To top it off, the dish mixes 

deliciously with the sweet pineapple.
If you’re a vegetarian, get rice with pan-fried Chinese broccoli 

with wine sauce dish ($7) or bean curd with brown sauce ($7). 
Ditch the nearby boba and quench your thirst with a cold 

cup of the honey and lemon beverage ($3.50) instead, which 
combines water, honey, lemon and sugar. 

A Café even has a great desert option (that isn’t a pound of 
flavorless froyo) if your stomach has room: shaved ice with red 
bean and vanilla ice cream ($5). For an alternative, go with a 
waffle topped with strawberry, kiwis and mango to eat with ice 
cream ($7).

LOOK FOR US 9th WEEK!

field, but it wasn’t enough.
With the win, Triton pitcher 

Camille Gaito (30-4) became the 
first pitcher in UCSD history to win 
30 games in a single season. Gaito, 
along with teammate Kris Lesovsky, 
was named to the National Fastpitch 
Coaches Association All-West Region 
First Team on Thursday, May 19. 
Gaito had eight strikeouts, while 
allowing only five hits in the win 
against CSUSB.

“I would have liked to have script-
ed it with a few more runs on the 
board, but we took advantage of a few 
of the errors that they made, and so I 
was happy with it,” head coach Patti 
Gerckens said. 

Standing one win away from the 
national championships, UCSD put 
the Coyotes away in another 3-1 win  
on Saturday with a three-run seventh 
inning.

Having recorded only one hit in 
the opening six innings, UCSD went 
into the seventh down 1-0. Leading 
off with the top of the batting order, 
Lesovsky was walked. She was fol-
lowed by Sepulveda, who reached 
first with her 16th bunt of the season. 

“I was just trying to lead off any 
way I could,” Lesovsky said. “I was 
looking for the hit, but I’ll take the 
walk any day.” 

Woofter grounded out to sec-
ond base but advanced Lesovsky 
and Sepulveda to second and third 
on a hit-and-run play. With one 
out, Gerckens called on junior Tess 
Granath to pinch hit. Granath sin-
gled through the right side to score 

Lesovsky easily, while Sepulveda 
slid home beneath the tag to put the 
Tritons up 2-1. 

“[CSUSB pitcher Cassidy Lee] was 
just pitching me outside all day yes-
terday, and I was just fouling it off, 
and not making too solid contact,” 
Granath said. “So I just got up to the 
plate and I knew it was coming.” 

Senior Jennifer De Fazio cemented 
the Triton win with a single to right 
field, batting in Granath to record her 
fifth RBI of the NCAA tournament.

“They kept their composure,” 
Gerckens said of the seventh inning. 
“[Lesovsky] did a great job of just 
being patient at the plate. Taylor 
[Sepulveda] laid a perfect bunt down. 
Woofter does exactly what I ask in a 
hit-and-run, and Tess Granath doesn’t 
get any bigger than that. [De Fazio] 
finally made the adjustment, and that 
was a great third run right there.”

The Tritons will head into 
the NCAA Division II Softball 
Championship on May 26-30 in 
Salem, Virginia as the winner of the 
West Region. Along with UCSD, 
the eight team tournament will fea-
ture Saginaw Valley State, Indiana 
(Pa.), Minnesota State-Mankato, 
Alabama-Huntsville, North Georgia, 
Midwestern State and the Triton’s first 
round opponents C.W. Post — the 
winner of the East Region. C.W. Post 
boasts a 41-14 record and entered the 
NCAA tournament ranked 25th.

UCSD’s first game is slated for 
Thursday at 12:00 p.m., 9:00 a.m. PST.

Tritons Crash Out of NCAA Tournament
By Liam Rose
Senior Staff Writer

BASEBALL—The Tritons were top-
ranked, hosts and favorites, but this 
weekend it was not enough as the 
UCSD baseball team fell in the NCAA 
West Regional Championships and 
will not advance to the Division II 
College World Series for the first time 
since 2008.

The Tritons fell 6-5 to conference 
rival Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday 
and were eliminated from the double 
elimination tournament. The Tritons 
lost the first game of the tournament 
4-0 to Sonoma State on Thursday and 
beat Western Oregon 6-3 on Friday. 

UCSD hosted regionals for the 
first time this year, thanks in part 
to a fundraising effort that put sta-
dium lights up at Triton Ballpark. The 
Tritons would have hosted last year, 
but were ineligible because of the lack 
of lights. 

With the loss to Sonoma, the 
Tritons had their backs against the 
wall in the loser’s bracket, and had 
to win four straight games to take 
the regional title. After getting past 
Western Oregon, Pomona proved too 
much for the Tritons in a tight game. 

The Tritons got on the board first, 
with an RBI single from designated 
hitter Michael Benton in the second 
inning. Triton starter Greg Selarz was 
roughed up in the early going, yield-
ing four runs on a pair of doubles in 
the fourth inning. Selarz was pulled 
after 3 2/3 innings pitched and Elias 
Tuma — most often used as the 
Triton’s closer — was brought in.

UCSD tied the game in the sev-
enth, as Evan Kehoe and Kellen Lee 
lead off the inning with back-to-
back hits. Garrett Tuck had an RBI 
single to score Kehoe, and Danny 
Susdorf hit a sacrifice fly to plate Lee. 
A Danny Susdorf single brought in 
Tuck before the inning was over. 

Pomona came right back in its 
half of the inning, as Humberto 
Tovalin scored from third on a field-
ing error by Triton first baseman 
Blake Tagmyer. Daniel Simmons 
came into relieve and got the Tritons 
out of a bases loaded jam, but still 
trailed 5-4. 

UCSD responded in the eighth 
inning, with the duo of Kehoe and 
Lee once again leading the way. 

Kehoe produced a one-out single, 
and Lee doubled in the next at bat to 
bring him in. 

Pomona once again responded in 
its half of the inning, as Chris Miller 
hit a double and was advanced to 
third on a wild pitch from Simmons. 
Designated hitter Tyson Edwards hit 
a shallow fly to center, but it was 
deep enough to score the run and the 
Broncos took a 6-5 lead. 

Down to the wire, Kyle Saul hit a 
one-out single to bring the go-ahead 
run to the plate. But Aaron Bauman 
grounded into a game-ending double 
play and the Tritons’ season was over.

“It was an incredible season,” head 
coach Dan O’Brien said. “These guys 
had it tough early in that everyone 
was gunning for them. They faced a 
lot of adversity and put themselves in 
a position where they could back up 
what they’ve done in the last couple 
years.”

 The Tritons finished the season 
42-15 overall. 

“I’m really just feeling for our 
senior class today,” O’Brien said. 
“Their career is coming to an end, 
but they have a lot to be proud of. I 
know we didn’t reach our ultimate 
goal, but I’ll tell you what, these guys 
are winners.” 

The Tritons had won two con-
secutive regional titles and fell in 
the national championship game last 
season. 

“This senior class took the pro-
gram to the next level, and took it to a 
national status,” O’Brien said. “Some 
of the guys are fifth-year seniors, so 
you’ve been to five regionals in a row, 
and those are the only five region-
als in the program’s history at the 
Division II level. You’ve been to two 
college world series and you’ve been 
to the national championship game. 
These guys are going to be incredibly 
disappointed in the short term but as 
time goes on they’ll realize just how 
special they are and how much they 
did for this program.”

Against Sonoma State in the 
opening game of the tournament, 
the Tritons fell as Seawolf starter 
Kenny Arnerich tossed a complete-
game shutout. 

“We didn’t play very well,” O’Brien 
said. “That’s the bottom line, we didn’t 
play well tonight. Surprisingly, the 
guys felt pressure today. We haven’t 

played like that in a couple months.” 
Tim Shibuya struck out 10 in 

eight innings of work, but gave up 
four runs. The Tritons were 0-5 with 
runners in scoring position and had 
a runner picked off at third. UCSD 
loaded the bases with one out in the 
ninth, but Arnerich got out of the 
jam by inducing the Tritons into two 
straight pop flys. 

On Friday against Western 
Oregon, Triton starter Guido 
Knudson threw an efficient complete 
game by allowing three runs on six 
hits, but none after the third inning. 

“I was just determined to get it 
done and give this team a quality 
start,” Knudson said. “I was locked 
in, I was ready to finish this thing and 
get us to tomorrow.” 

Aaron Bauman was three-for-four 
with two RBI and a solo home run to 
lead the Triton offense. 

The Tritons had a rough start to 
the season, going 14-11 in the first 
two months. But the squad caught 
fire and recorded 17 straight wins 
to close out the regular season. The 
Tritons also won their third straight 
CCAA Tournament this year.

COLLEGE 
WORLD SERIES

UCSD is set to make its first ever appearance in the Division II College World Series as West Region Champions.

By Rachel Uda •  SportS Editor
photoS By NolaN thomaS • Guardian

For the first time in program history, the UCSD softball team has advanced to the NCAA Division II Championship tournament after taking two games from No. 7 CSU San Bernardino last week in the best-of-three Super Regional series.
On Friday, the top-ranked Tritons capitalized on two CSUSB errors, 

scoring three runs in the third to claim a 3-1 win over the Coyotes in the 
series opener. 

With two outs, senior Kris Lesovsky advanced to second base on 
a passed ball after being hit by a pitch to get to first. Freshman Taylor 
Sepulveda — who leads the team with 15 sacrifice bunts this season — 
chopped one toward third 
baseman Alex 
Mitchell. Mitchell, 
who had been play-
ing close along 

the left field line to defend against the bunt, bobbled the ball and overthrew 
to first, giving Sepulveda enough time to reach second and for Lesovsky to 
reach home. 

Next at bat, senior Sarah Woofter popped up to right fielder Jamie 
Leffingwell in what should have been a routine out. But Leffingwell mis-

played the ball, allowing Woofter to make her way to 
second and for Sepulveda to score. Freshman Charly 
Swanberg singled through the left side — recording 
the Tritons’ only hit in the inning — to bring Woofter 
in to score.

The Coyotes had no response to the 3-0 Triton 
lead until the sixth inning, when 

designated hitter Stefanie Pace 
knocked a solo home run to left
