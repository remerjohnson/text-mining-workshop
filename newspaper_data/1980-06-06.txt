John Houseman brought good new. to Paper Chaae fan. 
at UCSD lut night. 

'Paper Chase' Isn't 
OVer: Housentan 

Series Might Continue 
BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 

News Editor 
There was more good news for Paper Chase fans last night 

than just John Houseman's campus lecture. 
"PBS is almost ready to announce that the show will be on 

the network next year," Houseman, the imperious Professor 
Kingsfield from the series, said last night. 

"The Chicago station started the whole thing, and w~ only 
need three more markets to go on the air. PBS looks like they 
can announce that on Monday. There'll be ten or so repeats 
and one or two new episodes. I will play Dr. Kingsfield again, 
and we're hoping to get the old cast back. Of course, they're 
all horribly successful now, so there might be some schedule 
conflicts," Houseman told about 1,000 students who 
crowded the Revelle Cafeteria to see him. 

1he announcement, like most of Houseman's career, was 
punctuated by applause. 

Houseman, who said it has become his "terrible duty," 
spoke for a few minutes about the character that, at age 70, 
was his first acting role. It won him an Academy Award for 
his performance in the movie that stiU attracts interest among 
college students identifying with its depiction of pointlessly 

com~titive life at Harvard Law. 
"The Kingsfield character is a contract law professor, and 

they seem to lend themselves to tyranny and bad behavior. 
"Kingsfield himself is based on a contract law professor 

named BiD Warren who taught in the end of the last century. 
He was brilliant, dedicated and cruel, an odd collection of 
tricks and wheezes. 

"He actually did give students five cents (that's all it cost to 
make a call then) and tell them to call and tell their mother 
they would be home quite soon . . 

"And it was his practice to pick a young student on the first 
day and reduce him to complete imbecility. Then, when the 
boy couldn't talk or reason anymore, he would say, 'now, 
we'll start at the beginning.' And then he'd say, 'Repeat: da.' 
And the boy would say it. Then he'd say, 'Repeat: da, da.' 
Then he'd pull a mock sheet over the podium and say 'You 
are buried.' And he wouldn't speak to him for the rest of the 
year. 

"He was arrested once and spent a night in jail for pissing 
on Boston commons. I don't know whether it was out of 
principle or need." 

Is Houseman like that? 
"Well, some of my behavior must be like Kingsfield, or 

moved over to him when I played him. And you can't get 
away from being typecast. I just played an archangel, and 
I'm sure there was some of Dr. Kingsfield in that. Anytime I 
gel a chance to play something different, I do," he said. 

Why is he reprising the role for PBS if it typecasts him, 
then? .

Grievance 
Filed By 
Herbenar 

BY leA THY HUFFER 
Assistant to the Chancellor 

Maryann Herbenar yesterday 
filed a formal grievance in 
protest of her layoff. 

The document ~sts 40 
policy and procedure sections 
that were allegedly violated by 
Chancellor William McElroy 
and the Staff Personnel Office. 

McElroy authorized the 
layoff several weeks ago at the 
request of Chancellor-
designate Richard Atkinson. 
Herbenar, who has worked at 
UCSD 12 years, is the first 
employee to be laid off as part 
of Atkinson's reorganization 
plans. 

However, Special Assistant 
to the Chancellor Andy 
Schneider, who, along with 
Herbenar, says he was led to 
believe by Atkinson that he 
would remain in office next 
year, has also been notified by 
McElroy that his position will 
not be available after August 
12. 

Schneider, who has been 
accepted to the Lyndon B. 
Johnson School of Public 
Relations for next faU, does not 
plan to contest the ending of 
his tenure here. 

In her grievance, Herbenar 
charges that her layoff, to take 
effect June 30, is unjustifiable 
because "there is neither lack 
of work nor lack of funds." 
University regulations 
stipulate that one of these 
conditions must be met for a 
layoff to be approved. 

MtElroy asserts, however, 
that because her position has 
been eliminated, no work is 
available to Herbenar. 

Last Tuesday . Herbenar 
was offered a replacement full-
time staff career position as an 
administrative analyst with 
Business Services. caUed the 
offer a "demotion," Herbenar 
said yesterday she would 
probably refuse the job. She 
must come to a decision by 
next Wednesday. 

"It's a made-up job," 
Herbenar said, explaining that 
the position was first offered to 
her last week as a four-month 
project to devise a service and 
facility resources manual. 
While her main task would stiU 
be the manual, the job was 
made into a full-time position, 
"in a very rushed manner," 
she charged. 

Herbenar also charges in 
her grievance that McElroy 
recently threatened that she 
would be without a job 
completely June 30 if "you do 
not stop fucking things up with 
this damned attorney stuff." 
Herbenar retained an attorney 
in late May. 

McElroy could not be 
reached for a response to the 
allegation.

About Half of UCSD 
Students Were For 9 

Reverse Earlier Straw Poll 
BY BECKY LOWEN 

Staff Writer 
Almost half of the students 

voting at UCSD supported 
Proposition 9 on Tuesday, 

_ figures from two campus 
precincts indicate. 

By a 36-vote margin (181 
For, 217 Against), the 
proposition was barely 
defeated here despite the 
warnings of administrators 
that the proposal would bring 
tuition to the UC system and 
despite the fact that an April 
straw poll conducted at the 
same time as AS elections 
showed that 92 percent of the 
student body opposed the 
measure. 

S~dents also showed a 
conservative streak in the 
Presidential race, reversing 
the state tally by giving Jimmy 
Carter 44 percent of 111e vote 
and Ted Kennedy 40 jlt:Icent. 
Kennedy beat Carter by 8 
percentage points in the state. 

Campus precinct figures 
showed that Ku Klux Klan 
leader Tom Metzger came in 
last of the three candidates in 
the 43rd congressional race, 
but that he did receive 30 
percent of the vote. Ed Skagen 
got 38 percent in the two 
precincts (almCMt exactly the 
same total as his district), but 
Solana Beach businessman 
Bud Higgins did six points 
better in the campus precincts 
than he did in the entire 
district. 

Higgins made · a campus 
appearance before he 
withdrew from the race two 
weeks ago. 

Proposition 11, the 
initiative that would have 
imposed a 10 percent tax on 
the oil companies, lost 53-47 
on campus despite heavy 
campaigning here by the "Tax

Police End Inquiry 
Into Center Theft 

BY JONAllIAN KROU 
Staff Writer 

The investigation into the 
May 8 Groundwork Book-
store theft has been halted. 

Roberto Riley, the member 
of the Groundwork collective 
who "slaked out" the 
bookstore and filed a theft 
complaint against UCSD 
police officer David Parham, 
who has resigned, said he is 
upset that "the half-asse,d 
investigation" has been 
stopped. 

"We want a thorough 
investigation," said Riley, who 
today will request the State 
Attorney General to continue 
the investigation. 

Riley met with Chief Hugh 
French and Lieutenant Uoyd 
Turner on Wednesday to 

discuss the status of the 
investigation. "The bottom 

~ne is that Parham has 
resiRned and the police don't 
think there is any more reason 
to investigate, and they are 
dropping it ," said Riley. 

"I'm pissed," said Riley, " I 
think we were naive in thinking 
the police would investigate 
themselves." Riley said he 
originally had faith the police 
would do a good job, but he no 
longer believes it is proper for 
the police to investigate 
themselves.

for my university and then I

my village." 

He has $5,000 in his pocket 
to pay the white man who will 
be his sponsor In France. 
These sponsors are 20th 
Century slave traders , 
capturing' their prey with 
dreams of a Paris which has 
never existed; easy jobs, free 
school, dancing women, and 
music in the streets.

PARIS - They say that 
during the Jazz age a black 
man. could eat a real dinner in 
Paris . . . and sit where he 
wished. Numbers have 
changed that. A few black 
musicians are not thousands of 
hungry, poor Africans looking 
for a job. In this futile hegira to 
nowhere they end up in Paris' 
immigrant ghettos, doing the 
"dog's work" and living thirty 
to a room. The story is 
repeated a thousand times. 
They come /rom Africa any

under brutal conditions , 
hidden on abandoned farms 
outside Paris while their 
sponsors search for a1egal 
papers and work. 

"The white man takes us in 
a truck, 15 together, to a big 
farm. We wait in a closed barn 
and he puts chains on our feet 
so we won't run away. It'scold 
and we have nothing. Two 
days, no food. I try to run out 
of the barn but he hits me on 
the head." 

They pay through the teeth 
for this privilege, sometimes as 
much as $20,000. The cash 
comes from the resources of 
an entire tribe who envision 
their youth walking gold· 
paved streets and sending 
back money to save the village 
from hunger, crop failure and 
disease. They can't stay in 
their native countries because 
of overwhelming unemploy·

To Stop Metzger's Hate 
We Must Stop· Hating Him. 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
Those of you who take C~mmunications 

classes are constantly told by the ideologues 
who teach in that program that there is no such 
thing as an objective journalist. 

Beresford·Howe ends his tenure as News 
Editor of the Doily Guardian today. 

They're right, of course, and their point was 
underscored for me Tuesday night. 

The occasion was the victory of Ku Klux 
Klan ringleader Tom Metzger in his race for the 
Democratic nomination in the 43rd 
congressional district , which includes this ' 
university. 

I was in Golden Hall covering the election for 
The Doily Guardian when the first returns 
came in showing Metzger ahead . Like every 
journalist and TV model in the auditorium, I 
Ilarted looking for the frontrunner, who was 
rumored to be walking around somewhere. 

I found him second. Ahead of me was a 
Channel 39 reporter who interviewed Metzger, 
shook his hand, and, in front of the county , 
wished "Tom" good luck. During the interview

llalked with him for a while, and it turned out 
that he was one of about a dozen bodyguards 
Metzger had with him, all dressed in suits. He 
tried to push me away, and told me that if I 
wanted to talk with the Wizard, I could talk to 
him in the Klan suite upstairs from the 
auditorium floor. 

So I did. 
The door to what really did look like a bunker 

was plastered with black MetzHer 
bumperstickers and the "security chief" (Q;' Do 
you guys have ~uns?" A:" l'd rather not 
comment on that. ' Q ;"Were you searched 
when you entered the hall?" A; "No. ") let me by 
after Metzger heard that I was a reporter . 

I walked in . There were several

disenfranchised immigrants go 
unheard in a land where 
"egalite, liberte, fraternite" is 
etched in stone above many 
doors. 

With French unemploy· 
ment up by 15.7 percent last 
year, to 1,416,000 people, 
Black immigrants are feeling 
the economic tremors . Like 
Blacks in America, they are 
traditionally the last hired and 
first fired and they bear the 
additional weight of precarious 
legal status. New French 
immigration laws have made 
deportation of "illegals" much 
easier. It' s a common sight in 
the Paris metro to see police 
"controllers '" demandin g 
papers of African and Arab 
men, while French natives 
watch passively from the 
sidelines and grumble, "They 
should remain in their own 
countries . "

The sun rises from the sea to

France is caught in a double

the image of a sterling 
democracy while she does 

business with South Africa's 
apartheid government , 
exploits the cheap labor and 
natural resources of former 
colonies, and creates a Black 
slave class at home. 

But the young men who rest 
in Africa's ghettos harbor one 
great hope even whae their 
brothers return home penniless 
and broken. Without the 
dream of Paris the future lies 
empty , time heavy.

American Law 
Slips As Protector 
Of Oppressed 

BY JOEL DREYRJSS 
Pacific Newt Service 

America is one of the few 
countries in the world where a 
court decision can provoke a 
race riot. The fact that an all· 
White jury's decision to acquit 
four White poljcemen in the 
death of a Black insurance 
salesman could trigger the 
country's worst racial incident 
in more than a decade is 
testament to the remarkable 
- almost naive - faith that 
Black Americans have in the 
law. 

Many Blacks view the law 
as their only protection against 
racism in America. They have 
no illusions that justice in 
America is meted out equally 
to all races and classes. But 
since the 19605 Blacks have 
come to expect our legal 
institutions to make some 
reasonable efforts toward the 
ideal of equal justice. 

The law has been the most 
effective tool in the struggle for 
equality in the last two 
decades. Laws and legal 
decisions made it possible for 
Blacks to vote, to elect each 

other to office, to' attend 
integrated schools, to move 
out of ghettos, to eat, drink, 
and sleep where they want, 
even to use public toilets. 

A complex fabric of 
Supreme Court decisions, 
federal legislation, executive 
decrees and administrative 
orders has enabled most 
Blacks to live in a manner 
which approximates !jghts 
taken for granted by the White 
middle class. Just 'as the 
Brown decision 01 1954 , 
outlawed the apartheid system 
that operated in the American 
South, the racial struggle in the 
1960s was shaped by a series 
of Supreme Court decisions 
that expanded the ability of 
Blacks to compete for jobs, to 
live in integrated neighbor. 
hoods, and to move closer to 
full citizenship. In the 1970s, 
the same pattern prevailed. 
The DeFunis, Bakke and

Iranians Accuse US

Iranian Foreign Mini.ter

and laid the next move toward 
resolving the .tandoff is up 10 
Washington. 

A more hopeful note was 
sounded yeaterday by an 
American clergyman who met 
with the Moslem militants 
holding AmerICan ho.tages. 

The Rev. John Walsh, a 
Southern Baptist chaplain at 
Princeton, said that as a result 
01 the talks he had rown "a 
6tt1e more optimistic about a 
solution to the 7 ·month·oId 
US· Iran confrontation. 

Hundreds of thousands of 
Iranians marched in Tehran to 
commemorate the 17th 
amiver.ary of a failed upriaing 
that marked the beginning of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho. 
meini'slong Itruggle to topple 
Shah Mohammad Reza 
Pahlavi, somethin, he and his 
followers IUCCeeded in finally 
doi!'8 16 months ago. 

Ghotbzadeh, .peaking at a 
"Crimes of America" 
conference In Tehran, 

-auerted that President Carter 
had found his popularity rising 

with the hostage crisis and 
decided to use it to help him 
win re-election. 

But 'we aren't going to give 
in to the political games of the 
United States," the Iranian 
foreign minister declared , 
repeatedly jabbing his left 
hand into the air . The 
audience of ' delegates froin 
some 50 nations applauded 
frequently . 

"We are told the problem of 
the hostages should be solved 
by us," Ghotbzadeh said. 
"How can we · solve the 
Problem of the hostages 
ourselves one·sided?" 

He said that once US 
actions in Iran over the past 
three decades are "clarified," 
the holtage issue "will be 
clarified as well." 

"If not, the problem will 
remain the same," he said. 

Ghotbzadeh apparently 
was alluding to. a proposal by 
Iranian President Abolhassan 
Bani·Sadr that an American 
commillion be established to 
examine and publish US 
government documents about 
alleged criminal intervention 
by the United States in Iranian 
affairs during the reign of the

A Transistor 
Is Made 
By Students 

An air of excitement swept 
the third floor of APM 
yesterday as a class of 
electrical engineering 
examined the first transistor to 
be created in a UCSD lab . 

Although transistors are a 
common item in electronics, 
UCSD only recently 
purchased the equipment 
necessary for teaching 
students how to make them. 

According to one student, 
the class is only one of the few 
on campus which gives 
beginning engineering 
students the opportunity to 
apply their theoretical 
knowled ge in pra cti ca l 
projects . 

The class, EECS 163B, is 
"a new , experimental 
situation," says assista nt 
professor Lew Goldberg, who 
instructs the class. 

"We hope we will get more 
equipment next year," he said , 
pointing out that the university 
had already poured hundreds 
of thousands of dollars into the 
course equipment because 
research into transistors and 
other semiconductors has 
quickly growing industrial 
applications. 

To make the transistor, the 
students took a delicate silicon 
crystal slice and infused and 
bonded various semiconduct-
ing chemicals to it. The end 
result was a tiny device which 
acts as a switch to turn on and 
off an electrical current.

While works by visual am 
students are usually: well-
represented at 'UCSD, the 
same cannot be said for their 
instructon. That is, until now. 
A faculty show at the 
Mandeville Art Gallery 
resolves this vacuum by 
providing 18 days of equal 
exhibition time from June 6 to 
June 26. 

Among the featured artists 
is Eleanor Antin, who with her 
husband David Antin, are the 
two leading . authorities on 

. performance art on the West 
Coast. A sell-proclaimed 
"post. conceptual artist," the 
associate professor's 90 
minute videotape, The N,urse 
and the Hijaclier will be shown 
at the exhibition. 

Harold Cohen is one in an 
increasing number of artiats 
who have chosen the 
computer as their rriedium. 
This interest began with the 
professor's move to San Diego 
after teaching at England's 
Camberwell School of Art,

----tivity Probe Carl)ival of Knowledge 
BY OiRJS SHERMAN 

!lalfWriW 
One of the thingl that 

human beingl do beat il 
tpeeulate about the nature of 
existence and "reality." The 
field i. wide open, becaUie 
whenever situationl ariae for a 
pOllible neat and tidy 
explanation, contradictions 
and conceptual flawl 
inevitably rear their ugly head, 

Hofstadter Successfully Integrates Codel, Escher, Bach place. through the book Hofstadter hal used Lewi. 
Carroll's characterl "Achillea" 
and "Tortoise" in whimsical 

'music~l' dialoguel, titling 
them "two part invention" or 
"Aria with Diverse Varia· 
tion." or even "SHRDLU, 
Toy of Man's Designing." The 
interaction between the two.. 
storybook characters and the 
others they encounter, written 
in a deliberate didactic style, 
serves to put the information 
into a dillerent perspective. 

the arti.t M.C. Escher, and 
Johann Sebastian Bach, we 
discover an incredible array of 
information. Rather than 
following the traditional 
approach of breaking reality 
down into component part. 
and trying to rebuild again, 

Bookt/Chri, SIae"nan 
causmg the d,il.traug t 
philosopher to go back to the 
drawing board, as they say. 
Whether their methods are 
scientific or hallucenogenic, 
reality seekers are doomed to 
have a inutrating time of it. 

Douglu, R. Holltadter may 
be able to help thingl a little, 
though. , In his new book, 
• ubtitled "A Metaphorical 
fuge on minds and machines in 
the spirit of Lewis Carroll," 
Hofstadter ambitiously tackles 
a variety of problematical 
question.. Structured around 
the creative lives of the 
mathematician Kurt Godel, 

Hofstadter takes a synthetic 
approach, illustrating various 
recurring patterns which pop 
up in many creative works. 

From a description of these 
patterns, which are labeled 
with musical terms (fugue, 
counterprint, etc.) we are 
launched full scale into an 
amazing carnival of know· 
ledge, where literally any sort 
of insight is allowed. The book 
is primarily a collection of 
inquiries into those ' various 
human projects which share 
structural similarities, trying to 
connect both the organization 
of a particular discipline and 

the underlying motivations 
which produce continuity and 
order. 

The book has a curious 
logic, as ·wdl. It begins with a 
few baaic suppositions that 
there are indeed certain 
recurring patterns in art, 
music, and other creative 
areas , and th~n foUows a 
historical route through the 
structure of language, both 
natur at and artificial , the 
structure of logic and 
mathematics as they rdate to 
language and communication, 
and so on. Gradually, 
Holstadter constructs a 
collection of information and 
ideas which intertwines and 
relates back to itself, like a 
complex Bach fugue, 9r an 
daborate drawing by Escher . 

A. an example of this style 
of writing, we let the book fall 

'open to page 525 and find a 
. heading entitled, "Levels of 
structure and meaning in 
proteins and music," where the 
patterns of genetic material 

are rdated to the organization 
of a mu.ical piece. Or, 
opening to chapter nine, we 
are treated to a description of 
the way the Zen malter 
Murnon and the mathemati· 
cian Godel might interact (thi. 
chapter is wonderful for the 
numerous ucher prints which 
are called in to mustrate 
certain points). And at various

concerning an old triend is 
related. 

"Throughout the work, the 
naivete of the narrator is 
unobtrusively integrated into 
the storyline," he says. 
Dresman, through elaboration 
upon and manipulation of the 
serenity of the ocean setting, 
lulls the reader into indirectly 
experiencing the carefree, life-
is-but·a·vacation-at·a-sea-
side-resort dream which the 
narrator believes he is living. 
"In the story, the narrator 
exists unaware of the primacy 
01 the acts he is doing," 
Dresman says. "There is an 
unconscious denial of the 
problematic aspects of life 
exhibited in this, which is 
brought to the surface when 
the telephone call forces 
recognition of the narrator's 
own morality. and undercuts 
his naivety." 

Lit Professor Excel s 
Dresman exemplifies his 
philosophy on writing. "I'm 
reading other writers, one is 
always struck by the diHerent 
chronological, geographical 
and situational contexts in 
which they write," he says. 
"While a writer should strive to 
break away from the influence 
of other writers, writing should 
be cosmopolitan in that it 
should integrate ideas derived 
from the experience of the 
writer, since what better 
perspective has one to write 
from than his own? 

The descriptive aspect of 
the story is not tangential, but 
rather an integral part of 
establislling this deceptively 
mellow mood. Two long 
passages regarding lobster 
research and body surfing are 
especially noteworthy. "The 
inclusion of these passages 
was not incidental," he notes. 
" I believe that there has been a 

science versus literature 
dichotomy in writing, and that 
fiction should inform as well as 
entertain, since the educa-
tional vehicle is there. In fact, 
one of the most frequent 
comments I've received about 
the piece is that someone has 
finally done descriptive justice 
to body surfing." 

Dreaman finds that the 
narrative style provides the 
best format for integrating the 
"compression of ideas and 
of moods which is poetry" into 
the short atory. "Many 
potential short stories are 
merely sketches which can be 
expanded; just as many novels 
are likewise revised and 
extended short stories," he 
says. "Writing poetry is an 
expeditious way of learning 
how to succinctly condense a 
story and at the same time 
enhance its lyrical quality. 

"Prose, of course, has its 
narrative advantages, and is 
also good for facilitating the 
transmission of an historical 
perspective on the story, 
especially so since history itself

is a sort of narrative." 
Using this perspective. 

Dresman imputes to his 
narrator in Summer Stars 
blissful unawareness of the 
passage of time. lhrough the 
reminiscence of all the good 
times with his friends, there is a 

Paul l>retman 

feeling generated that the 
narrator is reliving days past, 
even as he is speaking on the 
telephone. Temporal relation-
ships and their significance are 
frozen, vanquished from the 
character's reality, and "there 
is an unconscious acceptance 
of a Dionysian concept of the 
universe" on the narrator'l 
pari, which is abruptly 
shattered, he says. 

The character, through 
instantaneous revelation, 
experiences an acute and 
painful awareness of the 
present. More importantly, 
this serves to educate him so 
that he internalize's a 
perspective; that is, we all are 
going to die Sl)rne day, and 
while to some degree 
avoidance of the significance 
of progression of events is 
healthy, the same moment of 
the present which serves to 
obfuscate this importance can 
as easily make one all-too· 
aware of his or her own 
maturation cycle. 

In adopting the Southern 
California perspective, 

"Shortly before Summer 
Stars was written I had been 
working in the short story fonn 
extensively previous to the 
incident which prompted me to 
write it. I always try to keep 
memories stored in the back of 
my mind until the time is right 
to use them. Further, I had 
been concerned with certain 
technical and aesthetic aspects 
of my writing at that time. I just 
sat down and wrote it straight 
out." 

Dresman leeS value in 
spontaneous inspirational 
writing and then reviewing the 
draft to improve on it. 
"Things win just come popping 
out of your head, and it' slike a 
spontaneous experience," he 
says.

Houseman Lecture UEO Reorganization Set

"It would be ungracious and silly not to do it," he said. " In 
fact, I've been one of those fighting hardest to keep the show

Staff Writer 

alive." . 
Houseman, who produced the immensely successful 

Negro Theatre company as a federal depression project, has 
been involved in some of the best television ever cancelled,. 
including Playhouse 90 and The Seven Lively Arts, doesn't 
let himself get too angry that the Paper Chase was cancelled. 

"There's nothing new about the show being cancelled. If 
you get too angry, you're just being silly. 1nere's no point in 
being self· righteous or grand about it," he said before his free 
lecture. 

One thing that does anger Houseman, and is, he admits, a 
reflection of the Kingsfield character, is his belief that actors 
- and journalists - should do their homework. 

"Who was tnat (television reporter) who just interviewed 
me," he said before the show. She didn' t do her homework, or 
even bother to go down to the morgue and find out even the 
most rudimentary facts. I don't .give very good interviews to 

. people like that ." he said. 
'Joe same goes for writers. He didn't do one Paper Chase 

episode because of what he dismisses as a "crappy, terrible 
script."

Although details are yet to be released the six 
year old controversy over campus 
programming has finally come to a head, 
prompling a shake up in the University Events 
Office. . 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage says that he will "effect changes that 
need to be made while attempting not to 
destroy the good services delivered by UEO." 

Armitage added that he is delighted that the 
Registration Fee Committee ' 'has come up with 
concrele ways to bring all those concerned with 
campus programming together rather than 
having these groups . splinter off into rival 
factions which would create added costs." 

In addition to sayinj{ more money would be 
allocated for the subsidizinll of programminJ{ 
(which would not include increased outlays for 
staff salaries), Armitage said that he hQped to 
increase student conlrol of UEO. 

Armitage cited as "absolutely top priority the 
funding of a student controlled in·door facility, 
somewhat larger than Revelle Cafeteria." 

The "number two priority is the completion of 
the new 500 seat two and a half million do8ar 
amphitheater which is already under 
construction and is due to be completed in April 
1981. 

Armitage was careful. to point oul however, 
that almost all the construction co.ts for the new 
amphitheater will be paid externally by the 
community. (Students wiD only have limited aay 
over the use of this facitity and would therefore 
still need facility of their own). 

Dr. Roland Buck, Director of the Student 
Center agreed with many. of Armitage'. 
sentiments saying that the current proposal put 
before Armitage by the Registration Fee 
Committee would "primarily be interested in 
serving the students and not the c,onununity. 
Ten years ago the community W81 heavily 
involved in University events, however thing, 
have changed since then." 

Buck echoed Armitage's feelings on bringing 
together everyone who is currently concerned 
with campus programminR'

Metzger's 
Hate 
Continued from page 2 
shoes Metzger wore with his 
polyes ter suit. 

Metzger smiled . "What can 
I do for you?" 

"Well . to start, why do you 
, th ink you' re winning?" 

, Because the voters are fed 
up with all those refugees and 
boat people coming into thi. 
country. They have no place 
here," he said. 

I tried to sit still. He said he 
thought UC was a fine school, 
but didn 't think much of its 
Third World studies or 
affirmative action programs. 

I looked at the wall. Pictures 
of Metzger in Klan regalia in 
Oceanside and addressing the 
San Diego State rally, as well 
as snapshots taken with his 
family , covered one wall. 

" You know , I'm running as 
a small businessman, not a 
member of the Klan. The Klan 
hasn't even given me any 
money," he said. (The Times 
reported Wednesday that the 
Klan did give Metzger money, 
$300, about a.seventh of his 
campaign spending total). 

"Do you have any more 
questions ?" 

"No. Good.bye.:' 
I walked out of the room 

and met three friends who 
were waiting for me outside. 
They saw me throw my 
notebook to the ground and 
verbally abuse the Klan and its 
ideas. The Klansmen looked 
on with what appeared to be a 
perfectly dispassionate 
attitude. 

I said, and meant, that I 
hated the Klan, that I hated 
Metzger, and that I hated 
anyone who would vote for 
him. In fact, I said I wouldn't 
care if he was assassinated. 
My friends agreed, and we 
walked to a hospitality suite 
across the way to avoid the 
bodyguards . 

I am not relishing casting 
my vote in November for Clair 
Burgener. He will be the first 
Republican I've ever voted for, 
and his politics, which make 
Ronald Reagan look pink , 
disgust me. 

And I don 't think Clair 
Burgener would like me if he 
knew my politics. But even 
Clair Burgener hates Tom 
Metzger. 

And that's why Metzger is 
successful. Not only because 
he hates other people, but 
because other people hate 
him. It gives him recognition , 
access and, worst of all, the 
right to spread his hate. 

So I will do my best not to 
hate Metzger. And I hope 
other people do too, no matter 
how much restraint it requires.

Violent Students 
Offer Platform 
Edi tor: 

We wholeheartedly agree wi th the current student 
ca mpaigns to show solidarity agains t the dra ft registration arid 
the US government . and our organiza tion has some 
sugges tions: 

1) Sponsor a "Beat Up A Marine" day where 20 students 
assau lt a single marine who has been bound a nd gagged. 

2) Burn draft cards and the en tire s ta te of California to show 
the government that we mean business. 

3) Hold anti ·dra ft rallies on Revelle plaza every Thursday 
for the purpose of telling a nti ·government jokes. 

4) Desecrate the tombs of a ll past US Presidents. 
5) Show your disapproval of the draft by coming back for 

seconds at the Revelle cafe teria . 
6) Sponsor a "Have Lunch With a Russian Soldier" day 

where you invite Soviet troops to dine in your living room. 
7) Organize a guerilla warfare pa rty to capture KSDT to 

broadcast anti-government propaganda. 
Come join us in our cause! We will hold our firs t meeting 

June 16th at 3:00 am in the floor lounge on Argo VIII. Our 
first field trip will be to the Iranian embassy in Washington 
D.C. , & the first 25 members to join will receive free machine 
guns! 

San Diego Students For Violence (SDSV) 

Peace Students Hit 
Continued from page 2 
people work hard for their wealth, however this was discarded 
as being less important. 

5)The power of the government should be redistributed over 
the majority of the people. 

6)ln this 'new' (5) government, "the people should have 
control over the utilities and oil companies." 

The above points are suggestive of violent attacks against 
the very government which ensures the freedom of speech 
which the SDSP are so quick to use. Also, points 4,5, and 6 
strongly suggest socialism. Even more appalling, a professor 
from SDSU urged all of those at the rally not to vote for Carter, 
Reagan , or Anderson , but rather for the "Citizens Party." This 
occurrence at a SDSP rally is outright support, by an ASUCSD 
organization, for a particular political party . This is something 
which, clearly pointed out in the "Campus Activity Fee 
Guidelines," is a violation of school policy. 

Why is it assumed that the majority of students wish to 
support this organization and its constant, obnoxious 
rundown, knocking of US political system, or its obviou~ 
support for a non·democratic, anti· free market type of 
government? 

While the USA can stand much improvement, America is 
the best place to be. Many people have varied ideas as to how 
to improve America , and whether or not to resist the draft. To 
support one political ideology is not fair, and to support all is not 
feasible. Consequently, the ASUCSD must cease funding the 
SDSP immediately. If these people want to exercise their 
freedom of speech, fine . Just have them use their own money.

US Law Fails Blacks 
Continued from pagl' 3 
an a bility to appeal to higher 
authority: state appeals 
courts , federal courts, or the 
US Supreme Court itself. At 
some point , the defendants 
expected to find justice. That is 
why American prisons have a 
unique breed of jailhouse 
lawyers who keep their law 
books next to the Bible or the 
Koran. 

The killin g of Arthur 
M c Duffi e has special 

importance to Miami Blacks 
because he was a member of 
the Black middle class. The 
fact that his case went to trial 
when other reports of brutality 
did not had a great deal to do 
with class. But if McDuffie 
could not get justice from the 
legal system. what hope could 
there be for the men and 
women at the bottom? When 
the legal fabric collapsed and 
McDuffie's alleged killers were 
set loose, the fragile hopes ~f 

the underclass were shattered. 
The myth that justice would 
prevail - at least for those 
who had lifted themselves up 
from the lowest rungs of our 
society - had been proven 
false . 

Confr~nted with this reality, 
Blacks in Miami reacted by 
retreating to the rage and fear 
which is their legacy in 
America. 

Herbenar Files Grievance 
Continued from page 1 

McElroy, who compliments 
Herbenar's past perfonnance 
as his assistant, .ays he 
authorized the layoff at the 
request of Atkinson. 
According to Herbenar and 
Schneider, Atkinson made the 
layoff deci.ion on the advice of 
Assistant Chancellor Pat 
Ledden and Bruce Darling, an 
aide to Atkinson. 

Both ~dden and Darling 
refuse to di.cuss the layoff, 
citing personnel regulation 
reasons. Atkinson was 
unavailable for comment. 

Darling, however, did say 
that Atkinson does not want 
"as many assistants to the 
chancellor" as McElroy had. 
"It's not a question of 
personalities or individuals," 
he said. 

According to Herbenar, her 
layoff is also sexually 
discriminatory, as she i. the 
only woman of a non· 
secretarial position in the 
chancellor's office, and the 

only employee to be laid off. 
This change is further 

supported, Herbenar says, by 
the fact that Ledden, whose 
position was to expire at the 
end of this month, ·was 
continued indefinitely. 
Herbenar, on the· other hand, 
was hired a. a permanent staff 
employee. 

In her grievance, Herbenar 
also complain. that her layoff 
proposal, drafted by McElroy, 
was not properly reviewed by 
the Staff Personnel Supervi. 
sor, Quelda Wilson, who 
approved the layoff proposal 
in one day. 

According to Wilson, such 
proposals are commonly 
approved within a day or two, 
and are rarely rejected . 
Mc;Elroy's layoff complied 
with all necessary university 
policies, according to Wilson. 

Wilson is also temporarily 
acting as Affirmative Action 
Coordinator, who is 
responsible for ensuring that 
all affirmative action 

guidelines have been met in 
the layoff proposal. 

Herbenar's grievance 
charges that Wilson 
"summarily" approved the 
layoff proposal as confonning 
to affirmative action 
regulation. "without meaning. 
fur review." 

'In addition, Herbenar 
asserts that, in violation of 
university regulations, no 
personnel evaluation was 
iubmilled with the layoff 
proposal. McElroy confinned 
thi., .aying he has never 
written an evaluation . for any 
of his staff employees. 

University policy requires 
that any employee .to be raid 
off cannot be notified until their 
layoff proposal has been 
approved. This was violated, 
Herbenar say, when she was 
told of her layoff by Ledden 
several day. before the 
propOsal's approval. , 

McfJroy must reply to the 
grievance within 12 days. 

Police Drop Inquiry 
Continued (rom page 1 
investigation was ' carried out 
and everything was presented 
to the district attorney. The 
d.a. made the judgement that 
there was not sufficient 
evidence that a crime had been 
committed and the investiga-
tion was halted." 

Neither Chief French or 
Lieutenant Turner were 
available for comment. 

Riley's opinion is that the 
police are trying to protect the 
rest of the force by stopping 
the investigation. "They're 
making Parham a scapegoat. 
1bey cut their losses this way. 
1bey don't have to investigate 
anymore and they don'(have 
to look and see if anyone else 
in the police department is 
involved in the robberies. 
1bey don't have- to try to tie 
Parham into the other thefts in 
the Student Center," he said. 

S. R. Jones, a Groundwork 
collective member and friend 
of Riley's who has accom-
panied him to the .• everal 
meetings with the police, 
eXJ>ressed similar sentiments. 
"There has been an 
unwillingness to 'Consider 
whether this was an i.olated 
incident or related to other 
ca'!!JXls thefts." 

There are several reasons 
why Riley consider. the 
investigation "half-assed." He 
said the tape which recorded 
the conversation between him 
and Parham outside the 
Book.tore has never been 
transcribed or sent out to be 
made clearer. In Riley's 
opinion, "They didn't even 
want to listen to the tape."· 

Riley is also upset that the 
police did not fingerprint the 
cash box and money which the 
police held for three weeks. 
Riley claims that Parham 
handled the bills and coins in 
the cash box and said Parham 
denied touching the money. 

Jones recalls Chief French 
saying he would like to .end 
the cash box out for 
fingerprinting, "but they never 
sent it out," said Jones. 

French said in a May 14 
interview that he would not 
discuss whether the cash box 
would be fingerprinted , but 
added, "In a case of this 
magnitude I would want it sent 

to an . outside criminalistic 
laboratory. " . 

Riley added that the police 
have not investigated all the 
Bookstore's previous thefts. 
Nor did the police thoroughly 
investigate the five dollars 
missing from the bicyde store 
in the Student Center the same 
morning as the Groundwork 
theft, said Riley. "They didn't 
pursue it because they said 
there was insufficient 
documentation, and claimed 
there was no crime because 
the bike shop did not fill out a 
crime report," said Riley. 

Riley is not pleased that the 
officers who arrived on the 

scene of the Groundwork theft . 
were not interviewed to get 
their testimony. 

On May 15th Riley 
voluntarily took a lie detector 
test, but has not been able to 
see the results. "The police 
wouldn't let me have a copy of 
the results . They said it was 
confidential," said Riley. 

Riley has found a little 
humor in lhe distressing period 
since the theft, "I found 
humorous what French said in 
our las t meeting: 'If anything is 
missing in the future you 
should call the police .and not 
investigate it yourself.'" 

Black and Jewish 
Leaders Rip Metzger 
From the Allociated Pre.s 
A group of Black and 

Jewish leaders yesterday 
urged the Democratic Party to 
repudiate Thomas Metzger, 
the Ku Klux Klan leader who 
won the party's nomination in 
UCSD's 43rd Congressional 
District. 

Assembly Speaker Leo 
McCarthy, D·San Francisco, 
joined a Capitol news 
conference by the Black· 
Jewish group .and said he 
would do all he could to 
prevent Metzger from having 
any influence in Democratic 
affairs. . 

McCarthy conceded that he 
and other party leaders had 

not done enough betore 
Tuesday's primary election to 
tell voters in the Sa'n Diego 
area district of their opposition 
to Metzger. 

McCarthy stopped short of 
endorsing Clair Burgener, the 
veteran Republican incumbent 
in the district, who is expected 
to win reelection in November. 
He said he didn't tnink -
endorsement was necessary. 

State Sen. Diane Watson, 
D-Los Angeles, did endorse 
Burgener, as have several 
other Democratic leaders. She 
said she hoped the endorse· 
ment would increase 
Burgener's margin of victory. 

Houseman Lecture 
Continued from page 13 

"Of cour.e no one had the nerve to play the role, so they 
said I was off in Europe or something." 

Houseman admits, however,tht he didn't prepare much for 
his role as Kingsfield. . . 

A friend directing the Paper Chase asked him to do the 
role and he recommended other actors. 

"Most of the names I suggested were unavailable or dying, 
but the studio said to go ahead with the picture, and he went 
up to Toronto to shoot it. He called me then and a.ked me to 
do the role again, and I .aid that I had always want~ to and 
now because he had everything the cameras and lights and 
equipment. The studio wouldn't try and push him out of. the 
project because of me. They shot the whole of my role In a 
month," Hou.eman related. . 

CIA lot of my acting was really t~e .camera ~ork. They 
developed this idea so that at the beginning of the him I would 
always appear in giant c1ose .. ups and the class woul~ be 
comparitive midgets. As the film went on, our proportions 

aI " developed a more natur stance.

UCSD Vote 
Continued from page I 

Big Oil" coalition_ The 
measure 10lt by the same 
m8!.Jin statewide. 

The conservative trend 
foUowed by ItUdenta here 
didn't hold for Republicans, 
though. 

The organization And 
campaigning efforts of the 
campus' AnderlOll supporters 
paid off; the Illinois 
congressman received 20 
percent of the Republican vote 
here compared with only 11 
percent countywide. 

In the Republican Senate 
race, students again showed a 
more liberal spirit than the rest 
of the county, giving former 
Los Angeles Mayor Sam 
Y orty 35 percent of the vote to 
only 30 percent for 
Proposition 13 author Paul 
Gann. Countywide, Yorty 
received only 26 percent. 

The Democrats on campus 
showed their overwhelming 
support for Sen. Cranston, 
giving him 92 percent of the 
vote. He got 78 percent 
countywide. 

There were no surprises in 
any of the other ballot 
initiatives or races. 
Proposition 10 lost In the 
UCSD precincts ·with 63 
percent of the vote, similar to 
the countywide figure ; and 
Supervisor Roger Hedgecock 
won handily with 67 percent of 
the vote both here and 
district wide . 

Voter tum-out on campus 
was also very similar to the 
countywide turn-out - 57 
percent of the 714 registered 
voters here came to the polls
