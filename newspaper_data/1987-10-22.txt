Central to double in size 
-Controversy greets building plans. 

By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
Stall Writer 

Campus officials are planning to 
expand Central Library in a big 
way, but the way they want to go 
about it has some people concerned. 

Built 17 years ago, when UCSD 
had half the tudents it has today, 
Central i in dire need of expansion 
to proVide space for the additional 
books, eqUIpment, and study room 
that is necessary to meet the needs 

of a rapidly growing student pop-
ulation. 

Dr. Walter Heller , professor of 
economics at UCSD and the chair-
man of the Campus and Commun-
ity Environment Committee, and 
Roger Revelle, profe or of science 
and public policy and a founder of 
UCSD, are among those who 
strongly oppose architect Gunnar 
Birkerts' proposed new design for 
the library. They be~eve the library 
expansion would completely des-

troy the effect that late William 
Pereira intended - and succeeded 
in creating - when he drew up the 
plans for building the striking, 
diamond-shaped building. 

An open letter to the Guardian 
(10/l~ue) igned by Dr. Heller 
and Dr. Revelle, stated that "under 
[Birkerts' proposed de ign], all you 
would be able to see is an earthen 
berm leading up to the middle of a 
gla s tower." The two men also 
point out that the construction of 
"the berm" would necessitate the 
destruction of most of the remaan-
ing eucalyptus trees an the area. 

Because Birkerts would have it 
built at the outhwest ~Ide of the 
library, Doctors Heller and Revelle 
also claim that it i Birkert. ' mten-
tion to "soften" Perl'lra's destgn. 
Acknowledging that the new design 
"does create some usable space at 
the 'forum' level" and ha other 
"functional merits ," they still con-
clude that the new de ign if not 
nearly as good as Pereira's original 
concept, which has already become 
the symbol of this uOlver$ity.

A.S., GSA to solve T.A. problems together 
By MAUREEN SPURR 

Members of the Associated Stu-
dents (A.S.) and the Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) of 
UCSD met in a joint conference 
last Friday to discuss possible solu-
tions. for problems concerning 
UCSD's teaching assistants. 
. A statement was issued at the 
close of the meeting, calling for 
action as well as listing proposed 
goals for the improvement of T .A. 
instruction. Problems stemming 
from unbalanced student-to-T.A.-
ratios, T.A. training, and T.A. 
workload have become more con-
spicuous within the past two years. 
A common concern on this cam-
pus, as well as others in the UC 
system, is that the quality of educa-
tion will suffer greatly if the T.A. 
'ituation is not rectified . 

"The quality of education is 
deteriorating ," the GSA vice pres-
ident Michael Lasky, said. "This is 
due to massive enrollments, a 
greater influx of students, and more 
prelSure in the classrooms." Accord-
ing to Lasky, T .A .s bear the brunt 
of this prea ure, with oversized sec-
tions, unfair workloads due to the 
nature of courses, and they do not 
alway have enough information or 
experience required to teach oth-

ers. Until now, no move has been 
made to accommodate the growth 
in class size by adjusting T.A.'s 
sections. 

"This is a problem of primary 
importance," the A.S. president, 
Dave Marchick , said, "and by 

banding together with the GSA we 
are representing 16,000 students, 
not 2,500 and 13,500. We hope to 
discuss the issue at every level. " 

"We are pleased to be working 
as a joint force with the GSA ," Erik 
Basil, UCSA Employee Relations 

Coordinator, said . " It legitimizes 
our claims and proposals, [and] 
creates a feeling of unity. We are 
representatives of all students for a 
change." 

Both the GSA and A.S. feel con-
fident about their joined effort to 

Dave Marchick, Ertk Basil, and Mike Lasky diSCUSS the unificatIOn of undergraduate and graduate 
efforts at imprOVing the quality of UCSD TA 's. 

find a solution to the T.A. problem, 
and emphasize that they are con-
centrating on solving it as soon as 
possible. 

Members of both councils are 
enthusiastic about the joint state-
ment they issued after the meeting, 
which reads as follows: "The Asso-
ciated Students and Graduate Stu-
dent Association of the UCSD 
jointly recognize the urgent itua-
lions affecting the quality of educa-
tion on campus, specifically regard-
ing T.A. instruction . The two 
organizations have agreed to pursue 
the following goal : 
• The reduction of student to T.A. 

ratio 
• The establi hment of a required 

instructional traming cour e, to be 
taken by all T.A.s prior to entering 
instructional ituation, with just 
academic credit and compensation 
• And, the establishment of a fair , 

equitable T_A. workload system. 
The A 0 iated Students and 

the Graduate Student A sociation 
further agree to formulate a prop-
osal, dealing with the quality of 
education a mentioned above, to 
be submitted to the UCSD and sy -
temwide admini tralion in the near 
future."

Fuel cell-powered bus 
possible for future 

A city bus powered by fuel cells could 
be built using existing technology, 
according to a feasibility study by Los 
Alamos National Laboratory resear-
chers_ The recently published report also 
concludes that present disadvantages of a 
fuel -cell power system could be minim-
ized or eliminated by technological ad-
vances during the next five years_ 

As a result of the assessment , the U_S_ 
Departments of Transportation and 
Energy are developing a program to 
build and operate a prototype bus 
powered by hybrid system consisting of 
fuel cells and conventional batteries_ 

Fuel cells , which have been used 
extensively in the U_S. space program, 
are a type of electrochemical device that 
produces electricity from the chemical 
reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. They 
have several advantages over internal 
combustion engines , including greater 
efficiency, Quieter and cooler operation, 
and less maintenance. 

They also do not emit pollutants. "You 
put hydrogen and oxygen in," said Jim 
Huff of the EJectronicsResearch and 
Exploratory Development Group at Los 
Alamos, "and get water and electricity 
out. " 

A fuel-cell system for a city bus would 
use oxygen from the atmosphere and 
hydrogen from methanol , an abundant 
fuel source which can be easily stored 
and transported and which may replace 
gasoline as petroleum reserves are 
exhausted . 

Los Alamos has history of expertise in 
basic and applied fuel -cell technology . 
The research team used that base of 
experience, plus the lastest data about 
fuel cells and projections for the future , to 
reach conclusions about the immediate 
and future feasisbility of fuel-cell -powered 
buses . 

"We found that a fuel cell propulsion 
system is feasible in the near term with 
available technology ," said Pete Murray 
of the Lab 's Electronics Technology 
Applicaionsgroup and the project engi-

neer for the feasibility study. "Conven-
tional batteries will have to be used , how-
ever, to meet peak power demands." 

"There's no doubt in my mind that the 
technology can be improved--both to 
acheived better power-to-weight ratios 
and to lower the initial cost ," he said. 

THe initial cost is a main drawback of 
existing fuel.cell.powered systems. The 
researchers said costs must be cut more 
than 50 percent, during the life of the 
power system, to be competitive with 
diesel engines .

SDSU professor explores 
Soviet policy 

How much has the Soviet Union really 
changed in the Gorbachev era? The 
Soviet Union seems to be undergoing 
economic, political and social reforms. 
.These will affect Soviet daily life and 
undoubtedly have an impact on relation-
ships with the U.S. and the Welt. 

To better understand what is actually 
happening in the Soviet Union, the Inter-
national Forum is pleased to invite all 
San Diego residents to an open discus-
sion with Dr. Richard Gripp, a well-
known Soviet studies expert. 

The dicussion will be held on Tuesday,

Library addition 
Continued from pale 1 
the Regents for their approval. If 
approved by the Regents, the plan 
will be sent to the California State 
Legislature for their approval. The 
legislature has already approved 
the expenditure of $37 million on 
the expansion of Central Lbrary. 
Heller said that he has prelled hard 
for a new design - preferrably on 
the northeast, "canyon side" of the 
library - becaule he and Revelle 
are working under these deadlines. 

Heller also mentioned that one 
of the reasons the northeast side 
was turned down by the Facilitiel 
Delign and Conltruction Office 
becaule it would run llightly over 
budget and there could be a prob. 
lem explaining the COlt overrun to 
the legillature. Heller and Revelle 
conlider the northealt aide 01 the 
library a. the ideal lpot for the 
expanlion project becaule the 
remainder of the eucalyptul grove 
would not be affected and the view 
from the canyon once the library 
addition wal completed would be 
spectacular. 

Not aU of the interelted partiel 
agree with Heller and Revelle. 

Dorothy D. Gregor, the university 
librarian, likes Birkerts' original 
plan. Gregor is enthu.iastic about 
Sirkerts' de.ign because she be· 
Iieves it turns the "really usable 
space of the forum level into a 
large, functional place that at day· 
time is lit by the sunlight through 
the year, which would relieve the 
library'. 'dungeon.like' interior." 
She also stated that the most 
important aspect of a library should 
not be it, architectural appeal or its 
"striking concept," but "how it 
work. a. a library" and that it be a 
place where student. like to study. 

Gregor i. a110 concerned about 
"how the addition connect. to the 
existing library" - in other words, 
the ease with which people get 
around in the building. 

Becau.e of the controversy en· 
gendered by Birkerts' firat plan, 
UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkin· 
IOn requested that the architect 
submit another plan. These draw. 
ing, wiU be unveiled today, along 
with the original delign, at lOam in 
room 11 A at the Chancellor'. Com-

Working together 
La.ky emphasized, who maintained 
that this is not an antagoni.tic pro· 
cell and that the GSA is in full 
agreement. "It's jUlt an example of 
the student-elected leaders lhowing 
concem and lobbying it out for 
.tudents." 

All of the student leaders are 
optimi.tic about the outcome of the 
T.A. problem, and feel the Iolution 
i. in sight. They are looking for·

only to UCSD but to the .ystem·

Pelted with lava balls 

Volcano erupts under 
Scripps research ship 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
Nelli. EJitor 

Scientists on an expedition to learn more about 
volcani.m were given a first·hand lesson by an 
erupting underwater volcano that was a mere 150 
feet under their ,hip. 

Sased in La Jolla and led by Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography .cientist Harmon Craig, the 
relearch ship Melville wal conducting experiments 
two Sundays ago when the Mac Donald Seamount 
blew. The volcano sent lava rock. and enormou.

ville but apparently did not damage it.

gas bubbles to the surface, and turned the formerly 
green water a muddy brown. 

In a radio report sent the day alter the eruption, 
Craig described the scene: "Large gas·and.steam 
bubbles burst at the surface with chocolate·colored 
water and, best of all,lteaming lava balls too hot to 
hold in bare hands." 

The ship was about 650 miles southeast of 
Tahiti at the time of the incident, on the first leg of a 
four·month expedition to study volcanism in the 
Pacific Ocean. When it arrived at, or rather, over 
the vokano, they noticed "large patches of green· 
ish.brown water over the summit .... Immediately 
after the fint hydrocast into this discolored water, 
MacDonald erupted under u.," reported Craig. 

The ship rang with "horrendous clangs and 
clamorl," according to the report, but apparently 
there wal no damage. 

In an article in the Los Angeles Time., Univer· 
lity 01 Waihington oceanographer Stephen Riser 
said that it was not .urpri.ing that there wa. vol· 
canic activity in the area, however, it was unusual 
to have vokanic activity directly under the ,hip. 
"This is one of the most unexplored portions of the 
world's oceans," Riler said. "It's just amazing to 
think about sitting there in a ship and seeing rocks 
corning out of the wa ter ." 

At thi~ point, no one knows how this eruption 
and others like it affect the ocean. "As to whether 
it's truly significant on some sort of a global scale or 
whether it's a curiousity, that I'm not really sure of 
yet, and I don't think anybody else is either," Riser 
gid. ~

Is it real? 

The day the earth stood still 
By MATT MAC ARTHUR 
Stoll Writer 

Hurry uP. call the Enquirer, book 
a spot .on ·Johnny Carson .. . yes, 
Muir College has real live psychics 
in their midst. But the subject of 
their predictions is nothing as mun-
dane as the traditional tabloid fare. 
They are concerned with disaster 
- earthquakes to be precise. 

When they called all of us Muir 
residents together to tell us that 
there would be an earthquake at 
7:15 am on Thursday, Oct. 8. 
nobody took it too seriously . Hey 
those things happen in L.A .• right? 
Somehow it 's their punishltlent for 
existence. But here, no way .. . that's 
too real for this college. 

So, for us , the night of Oct. 7 
was like any other night. We went 
to bed with no more than the usual 

stress of five papers due the next 
day . Little did we know that on 
some quiet, subconscious level, 
"Cement City" was bracing itself 
for disaster. 

We were "eased" back into real-
ity the next morning by the gentle 
howl of the fire alann at the ungodly 
hour of 7: 16 am. At first, I thought 
one of my apartment-mates had 
placed my alarm clock over my ear 
as a joke, But, in the next instant, I 
realized the gravity of the situation. 

We straggled out of our rooms 
one by one. 

"What's happening?" I cried. 
"Oh. it's just the earthquake," 

my friend said. yawning. 
"Well, we'd better get out." I

seem like every ambulance in the 
county was sent only to Muir Col·

every girl at Muir perfectly drelled

Clarifying co-op 
controversy 
Editor: 

We are writing to you in response 
to the letter to the Editor entitled 
" Restructuring the Co-ops: good or 
bad?" in the October 19 issue of 
the Cuardian. We feel that there 
have been a few misinterpretations, 
and would like to clarify the issues. 

The issue of the leases of the 
co-ops has not been correctly stated. 
S.R. Jones said that Jim Carruth-
ers, the director of the University 
Center , decided to permit the leases 
to lapse. This is true, but the reason 
has been conveniently left oul. Jim 
felt that leases for student organiza-
tions, such as the co·ops, which are 
subsidized by the University Center 
Board.(VCB), are inappropriate. 
He decided to allow the leases to 
lapse and wait for the UCB to meet 

• 

in the fall . This would allow the 
students to decide on the matter, 
which we did, and changed the 
tenn "lease" to "agreement." These 
agreements are much more appro-
priate. 

Thanks to Jim Carruthers. we 
didn't just blindly sign a lease, as 
has happened in previous years . 
Jim Carruthers' position as Direc-
tor of the Univeuity Center il to 
advise and inform the UCB on all 
matters presented before it, so that 
we can make informed . responsible 
decisions. 

Furthermore. with regard 10 the 
restructuring of the co·opa. we 
would like 10 clarify the intent of the 
VCB. With the completion of the 
University Center. additional space 
will become available in the exist-
ing studenl center. In order to 
decide who should get that space,

stood. With this in mind, the UCB 
will be researching and evaluating 
the co-ops with respect to the pur-
pose, structure and financial ac-
countability to those who fund them 

you, the students! 
5.R. Jones feels that this research 

is an "attempt to force the internal 
reorganization of the co-ops/col. 
lectives." This is entirely untrue _ 
The UCB does not want to tell 
these organizations how to spend 
their money. who they should hire . 
or what their beliefs should be ; but 
we do feel that in order for these 
organizations to be accountable to 
students , we must figure out how. 
and under what guidelines the co-
ops should be responsible to the 
board . In order to do so. we must 
clarify the issues and figure out the

New provost reveals plans for Muir 
By SAMANTHA BEIGEL 

Editor's note : This is the first in 
a series of interviews with the new 
deans and."rovosts at UCSD. Each 
cam"us, with the exce"tion of Re· 
velie. has had an administrative 
change this fall. The two new 
administrators at Fifth College have 
already assumed these "osilions as 
wel/. 

Those holding the offices of dean 
and "rovost exert great influence 
on the direction in which their 
res"ective college will be raking in 
the future. 

goals. Yet, Ledden not only is 
interested in bettering Muir College 
as a whole , he is also interested in 
the individual students. He is con· 
cerned about getting to know his 
students better. 

Guardian: Since you were ap· 
pointed provost, what have you 
been doing to familiarize yourself 
with the college and your job? 

Ledden: Since I have not really 
been active in Muir College itself 
for about eight years, I spent the 
,summer getting re.acquainted with 
it. I wanted to know what was 
going on in the college - what the 
stall was doing, who the students 

meeting their needs. 
Guardian: What are some of 

your short·term goals? 

Ledden: The first thing I have 
been working on is the recruitment 
and retention of outstanding stu· 
dents. I want the faculty and stu· 
dents to playa role in this process. I 
simply want ideas on how we can 
convey the altractivenesl of our 
college and all of the outstanding 
features that it offers. I feel that the 
students and faculty would be as 
helpful as anyone else, because 
they experience what this college 
offers. I am also interested in the 
recruitment of minorities and I feel Whether having lunch in the 

cafeteria or walking around cam· 
pus, Muir's new provost , Patrick 
Ledden, is willing to talk to his stu· 
dents and hear any new ideas con· 
cerning the college. 

A stall member at UCSD since 
1966, Ledden has been an influen· 
tial part of the mathematics pro· 
gram and will continue to teach at 
least two courses a year in that 
department. along with serving as 
provost. Besides being a Muir Col. 
lege faculty charter member , and 
acting provost of Muir college from 
1971·1973, as well as the first 
provost of Warren College in 1973, 
Ledden has been the assistant 
chancellor at UCSD for the past 
eight years . Thus, Ledden has been 
directly involved in the all airs of the 
school which puts him in tune with 
his students and their interests and 

"I want the students to have an integral part in 
the decision-making process. I want to hear 
their ideas on some of the changes that I want to 
take place."

were. I spent the time becoming 
active with the college stalf and 
saw how outstanding they really 
were. For the fall and winter quar· 
ters I am expecting to get reo 
acquainted with the faculty and 
students. I want to find out what 
new major programs are needed 
and what the expectations are of 
the faculty and students. I want to 
find out what their needs are and 
determine the role of the college in

that this is another way in which the 
college plays a definite role. 

Another goal [I have] is toeslab·

I want them to stay in touch with 
the college and the advancements

Guardian: This year the compe·

competitive. What do you attribute 
this to? 

Ledden: Well, this year it was

to get into. We received ~OOO

comparable education to everyone 
else in the system. We have enough 
programs to attract an array of 
people and, because Muir is so flex · 
ible, we offer an inviting program. 
Plus, we have a fantastic locations. 
\Yho wouldn't want to go to school 
here? 

Because so many people applied 
we had to be more selective. How-
ever, we also have top students 
applying because they are realizing 
that they are gelling more for their 
money here . We are offering a lot 
at a pretty inexpensive price. We 
are getting people with higher SA T 
scores and higher grade point 
averages, simply because more 
people are realizing that this is an 
ideal place to go to school. 

Guardian: What changes do 
you foresee? In what direction will 
Muir College be moving? 

Ledden: Right now Muir is the 
largest of the colleges with 3,500 
studenll. This is basically a good 
size, [though] ideally it should be a . 

bit smaUer. [A smaUer] size allow. 
for individuality, but also allows for 
a variety of programs for studenll 
to choose from. So, in terms of 
expansion, we are hoping we might 
make the school slightly smaller in 
the coming years to retain the sense 
of intimacy that the school POl' 
sellSes. 

I also want the college to take a 
more active role in getting off· 
campus and upper division students 
to participate in the activities and 
programs the college oilers. It is 
important for transfer and commu· 
ter students to interact and become 
incorporated into the life here . This 
has always been a type of chal· 
lenge because it is often difficult to 
find ways to get these students 
involved. 

" Ideally, [Muir] should 
be a bit smaller, this al-
lows for individuality." 

-Provost Ledden 

Guardian: In what ways are y~u 
trying to institute the changes you 
want to take place? 

Ledden: Well , I want the stu· 
dents to have an integral part in the 
decision.making process. I want to 
hear their ideas on some of the 
changes that I want to take place. I 
eat in the cafeteria every Wednes· 
day 10 I can get to know the stu· 
dents. I have met many students 
because I taught many lower div. 
ision classes. I want to know what 

othey feel needs to be improved and 
what changes they want to see 
in.tituted. 

. Bryan Bily~u/C"ardlan 
Provost Ledden is involved with 
students on a number of levels. 
He IS a professor and a provost, 
and makes himself available for 
student advising, 

I have learned many things by 
talking to students. This is a big, 
complicated institution and it is dif· 
ficult to know what is always going 
on. Provosts have an advantage, 
because talking to students is part 
of their job. We have the time and 
interest to find out from the stu· 
dents how the educational process 
is doing. We have an excellent 
educational program, but it can 
always be made better. We wanllo 
improve it in any way we can. rnI

There is a still cenler of Eternity, A place where all pasts, presents and futures meet. • This inlersecting point of knowledge and experience, pleasure and pain, monaJity 
and immortality has been described and referred to in a variety of different ways by 

mystics, prophets and teachers who have experienced it 

Some have described il as God or Heaven, Others have referred to it as Nirvana or Tao. 
In Zen it is called Zen mind or EnJightenment. 

While names, descriptions and methods for reaching the still center of being vary 
greatly, the ultimate worth of this awareness is agreed upon by all who have shared it. The 
experience of the sliD center of being brings freedom, self-conlrol, balance and power to 
those who have attuned their lives to it. 

Zen is the study of the Ten 11lousand States of Mind and of Efili8btenment, the sdI a!Mer

Soccer edges laVerne 1-0 
By MIKE FOLEY 

As their season winds down, the 
UCSD men's soccer team faces a 
critical test this week. In the first of 
this week's "must win" games, the 
Tritons used a workman·like effort 
to beat laVerne ) ·0 Wednesday 
at Warren Field. The second im-
portant game is this Sunday at 
Claremont-Mudd. UCSD must also 
win this game to help its chances of 
making this year's NCAA regional 
playolls. A loss may eliminate 
UCSD altogether. 

Yesterday's big game marked 
the return of Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong who has been away 
coaching the U.S. Junior National 
Team. UCSD controlled much of 
~he first half of the game, but this 
half was played mostly at midfield 
with lew scoring chances lor either 
team. Five minutes into the game 
UCSD had its lirst scoring oppor· 
tunity , but a scissor kick by Erik 
Dingwall sailed wide. A few mintues 
later Dain Deforest had his point· 
blank header stopped by a brillant 

Scott Hyver (#19) came up from his fullback pOSition to play offense 
often during the game 

sa ve by the La Verne goalie. Scott 
Hyver made some strong runs up 
the right -sideline from his fullback 
position, keeping the La Verne de-
fense busy . When La Verne finally 
did get some shots on goal they 
were shut -down by goalie, Greg 
Stadler, who played very well until 
being forced out 01 the game late in 
the first half with a sprained ankle. 
He was replaced by Brian Sil-
jander. 

The Tritons picked up their game 
in the second half and were able to 
keep the ball in La Verne's half for 
most of the final 90 minutes. UCSD 
kept up a steady, patient attack 
throughout most 01 the half, but 
despite some good opportunites 
created by Scott Rommel and Dain 
Deforest , the Tritons did not score 
until the game's 76th minute, when 
Mike Lodoen was able to beat the 
La Verne goalie on a one on one lor 
the game 's only goal. UCSD made 
the goal stand-up and came out 
with a hard fought and well de-
served win. 

Sunday's game is even more crit-
ical for UCSD. A win over archri-
val Claremont-Mudd is crucial for 
the team's playoff hopes . The team 
ha s a lew more important home 
games remaining and would greatly 
appreciate peoJile coming out to 
watch the games. Sophomore Mike 
Bradley said, "The more people 
that co me out, the better we 
play." ~

Commentary' 

Bring back scabs! 
This Thursday is day seven of 

the un-strike. 
And Eric Dickerson already 

wants a raise, just for practicing_ 
Imagine what he would want if he 
actually played in a game. 

Most of the regulars reported too 
late to get in last weekend's games, 
so this Sunday will mark the return 
of "real" football. 

People in Philadelphia and St. 
Louis didn't even notice because 
who the hell actually plays for them 
anyway? 

People in Indianapolis noticed 
that there were some different guys 
on the lield ; they actually won two 
games (equalling last year's total) . 

All 01 us in San Diego have to be 
disappointed with the strike ending. 
The re-Chargers went 3 and 0, all 
on the road to take the division 
lead . The odds of them winning 
three more games on the road this 
year are about the same as those 
for Rusty Hilger winning the MVP 
- not a pretty picture is it? 

Kansas City, on the other hand, 
has to be the team in worst shape. 
Their scabs went 0 for the strike. 
How happy do you think the real 
Chiefs were? 

This weekend features a rematch

of the last pre-strike game, as the 
Bears get to maul Tampa Bay 
again. Jim MacMahon is back in 
uniform for the first time since the 
infamous Charles Martin body-slam 
incident last year. I for one can't 
wait to see Jim and his beer belly 
scrambling away from the mad 
Tampa Bay rush. I think his Taco 
Bell commercials will be more excit-
ing than this game. 

A court in Miami just gave 
Alonzo Highsmith, Houston's first 
pick this year, free-agency. And he 
didn't even go on strike before sign-
ing his contract. All those other 
guys did it backwards . Of course 
these are the same Miami courts 
which just made it legal to carry a 
gun in public (for the first time in the 
United States since 1896). Makes 
you wonder what they're 
taking down there . 

Do you realize that all the Giants 
have to do is lose their next five

lo •• es as books (ten). All that think· 
ing in the off-season is coming back 
to haunt them.

I'm on the subject of looks, isn't 
Willie McGee (of the baseball Car-

sional sports? , 

Now that it's been a week, I feel 
that it's time to look back objec-
tively on the strike. The players lost 
24 day» of pay. The owners saved 
big bucks on salaries, and made 
more money off scab games. 

The players found out that their 
union is about as solid as a marsh: 
mallow. The owners found out that 
the players' union is about as solid

,I.M.s in full swing! 
By PHIL GRUEN

You say you don't play on an 
intramural team? You say you 
don't have any intention of joining 
one? Well , there's no doubt you're 
a minority here at UCSD. 

program here is in Division III 01 
the NCAA, which is far less com-
petitive than, say, intercollegiate 
sports at the Division I level. 

sider if you will: 

With approximately 60-70 per-
cent of the student body (est. 
15,000 Itudents) participating in 
intramural 'ports, the program is 
unquestionably one of the strongest 
assets to this campUI, and has been 
ever since UCSD opened its gates. 

What makel intramural sports 
at UCSD so special il due primarily 
to the fact that the intercollegiate 

It is fair to say that, because it is 
a Division III school athletically. 
most of the students, unless they 
are on a team or have good friends 
who are , tend not to care that much 
about the intercollegiate athletic 
program here. Therefore, many 
students tum to intramural sports 
participation. 

According to associate intramu-
ral sports director Scott Berndes, 
the program is "one of the finest in 
the country." There is a great deal 
of validity to this statement. Con-

KeVin Simon to finally come through In coeo, 
undeteated ET S Crew Will oe taking on The 
Scrubs wno are also undeleated ThiS game 
features some of the superstars of 1M's 

Of course theres the Intamous E T , Enc 
Turner, himself Whal can I say about him that 
hasn t already been said like "sltck to soccer 
The Scrubs are no scrubs at all They feature 
everyone s favonte HA by way of Tenaya Hall. 
Carolyn Hoffman ThiS game also features a 
performer that has inspired many hairdos on 
campus th iS year Spike Jill Vanderwolk Look

tOUChdown With no lime remaining 

Highest scoring team. or the show-no-

go-so-we-can-run-up-the-score-some-more-
team IS Slow & Ugly In the Men 's 'A They 
have scored 106 POints In three games 
Sounds like 'AA' playoff malenal to me 

Stingiest detense In IM's honors go to five 
coed teams The Anchormen. Scrubs, Ers 
Crew, Phi Gees, and the awesome Rose-
Aholtcs who have each not given up a single 
point yet thiS season, The Rose -Aholtcs have 
also scored 97 POints In the two games tha y 
have played Oh Rlta ll SpeCial mention here 
should be made to the Men's Single 'A team 
Re -Born deformed These guys have given uP: 
only 1 POlOt In threE' games, and are 2 lOne 
pOint you say? Thais nghtl They lost In over-
time In the Calltornla Tiebreaker Without either 
team scoring a pOint OffiCially the game was 
recorded a I -0 win tor the Bamblclubbers 
Must have been some great pllchlng In that

BUDWEISER TEAM OF THE WEEK 
LICENSE TO DROWN 
AA INNERTUBE WATERPOLO 

This Bud Team of the Week goes to some veterans of Innertube 
waterpolo. LICENSE TO DROWN is an AA team who won a 
tough match Sunday night over TEAM SEX 16-12. 

Chris Holmes led the scoring drive with 6 of the 16 goals, but 
viCIOUS women could be the key to a championship this season. 
With a half-time defiCIt of only one point. Team Sex looked 
hopeful, but they didn't have the stamina to go all the way 
because when things really got wet and wild the experienced 
Ucense to Drown squad came out on top, 

After the game Team Sex was headed for a cold shower and 
Ucense to Drown was headed for a cold BUD.

glance it would seem 
that "No Man's Land" would 
fit nicely into the category of 
bloody action movies with a 
healthy dose of fast cars and 
beautiful women. But, surpri-
singly, director Peter 
Werner (best known for his 
direction of the first 8 epi-
sodes of "Moonlighting") has 
a few new twists for the stan-
dard plot. 

In the opening scenes, an 
undercover policeman is shot 
by an unknown killer. It is 
then that, rookie cop Benji 
Taylor, played marvelously by 
D.B. Sweeney ("Gardens of 
Stone, It) is assigned to find 
the killer. To do this, he goes 
undercover to infiltrate the 
stolen Porsche ring led by Ted 
Varrick (Charlie Sheen, of 
"Platoon" fame). 

But Taylor isn't the usual 
undercover cop. In fact, he 
rather enjoys the life of a car 
theif - the cars, the money, the 
nightlife, and the seductive 
danger. His friendship with 
the young Yanick also grows, 
as does his relationship with 
Varrick's beautiful sister 
(model Lara Harris.) This cre-
ates the intriguing point of the 
movie. The line between good 
and bad isn't easily drawn as 
in other films. Varrick's cha-
racter is seen as young, charm-

and friendly. 
s hazy line between right 

wrong is also indistin-
guishable to Taylor, who in-

to his boss that Varrick is 
not a cop-killer. The movie 

keeps the viewer on edge with 
this uncertainty. Suddenly , 
Taylor isn't sure of who he's 
working for, along with who 
he owes his loyalty. 

It is the chemistry between 
Sweeney and Sheen that really 
makes the film work. There 
are several excellent scenes dis-
playing the comraderie of two 
men enjoying their work . 
Sheen's handsome charm and 
Sweeney's down-home affabi-
lity make an excellent combin-
ation. 

Another good asset of the 
picture is the likeability of the 
chara"ters. Sweeney, an inno-
cent rookie cop, is obvioulsy 
overwhelmed by his job and 
hiS reponsibilities. Varrick, al-
though the successful leader 
of the stolen Porsche ring, 
shows that he, too, is human. 
These weaknesses make him 
much more appealing and like-
able. Instead of being a one-
dimensional car thief, he has 
doubts about hiniself and his 
actions. 

Of course, there is also the 
action element which moves 
the Imovie along at a fever 
pitch. Several classic car scenes 
carried out with impressive 
Porsches through Los Angeles 
landmarks, although trite, are 
well done. 

Because of the new twists to 
a familiar plot, "No Man's 
Land" is an entertaining film 
with lots of action and an 
enjoyable cameo appearance 
by L.A. 's own Untouchables. . ./

Music in exile 
by isabelle tihanyi 

hiatul staff writer 

Inti-lIIimani is a group of 
Latin American musicians 
named after an Aymara lan-
guage expression that toughly 
translates as "children of the 
sun." Inti-lIIimani will be play-
ing in San Diego on October 
27 through the sponsorship of 
the Latin American Cultural 
Center (LACC), a UCSD stu-
dent organization coordinated 
by graduate student, Dora L. 
Cobian_ 

"The LACC is interested in 
the common problems of Latin 
America. We present the cul-
ture of the different coun-
tries," Cobian said. 

The group, which was found-
ed in Chile in 1967, is commit-
ted through their art to liberty 
and justice within the New 
Song movement of Latin Amer~ 
ica. 

Due to the military coup of 
1973, Inti~IIIimani has been · 
living in exile in Italy. They 
have continued to show sup-
port for the artists and others 
who were persecuted in Chile 
and throughout the Third 
World. Though Inti-IIIimani's 
music is censored in Chile, it 
has remained very close to the 
people through underground 
channels. 

Human feelings and aspir-
ations are portrayed through 
the use of more than 25 Indian

and modern instruments; pre-
Columbian and contemporary 
elements are present in their 
music. The group' artistic crea-
tion and performance is said 
to be "a blend of beauty and 
hope. " 

One oflnti-Illimani's mem-
bers best expressed the mean-
ing of the music during a 1985 
interview, "It is important for 
the people of the world to get 
to know each other. Perhaps 
by knowing each other, by 
understanding each other's 
music and culture, we'll be 
able to live better on this 
planet. " 

According to Cecilia-Ubil~ 
la~Arenas, OASIS Language 
Program Director and LACC 
member, a full house of at 
least 800 is expected for the 
San Diego show. "The LACC 
feels that the visit by Inti-
IIIimani is a significant contri-
bution to the cultural atmos-
phere of San Diego." 

Ubilla-Arenas also said that 
the group will be available to 
meet the audience at a recep-
tion follOWing the show where 
they will be autographing a 
souvenir poster of the concert. 

Showtime is 7 pm at Lewis 
Jr. High School at 5170 Green~ 
brier Ave. Ticket prices are: 
Donors $15; General Admis-
sion $12; Seniors!Students! ~ 
Children $8. For information

San Diego's Museum of 
Photographic Arts, located in 
Balboa Park, is currently fea-
turing "introductions: EX-
TENDED IMAGES," an ex-
hibit of nontraditional work 
merging photographic images 
with paint, attached objects 
and elaborate sets. The exhibit, 
which runs until Nov . 22, and 
numbers approximately 90 
pieces, includes the craft of 
American artists Faiya Fred-
man; Holly Roberts, collabor-
ators Patrick Nagatani and 
AnQree Tracey; and Gwen 
Akin and Allan LudWig. 

None of the artists, accor-
ding to MoPA executive direc~ 
tor Arthur Oilman, "deal with 
photography as if it were a 

feet. Her works, sepia-toned 
and Impressiw in cale, can be 
noted for their originality. 

Collaborators Patrick Na-
gatani (photographer) and. 
Andree Tracey (painter) li -
ven-up the show with their 
humorous, colorful product: 

20-by-24~inch Polaroid in-
stant-camera images of a typi -
cally oriental and caucasian 
mix of subjects undergoing 
such related experiences as 
"Bikini Tests" and "Indian 
Summers." 

The work of Holly Roberts, 
by contrast, is anything but 
upbeat. Borrowing heavily 
from Native American motifs 
- especially the painting of 
petroglyphs - and sporting 
such titles as "Steer's Head" 
(long since detached from the 
steer) and "Dog at the Dump," 
her dark, simply drawn images 
remind one of something like 
"Ernie Pook's Comeek" and 
"Life in Hell" rolled into one.

Akin and Allan Ludwig take it 
one step further by refUSing to 
cover up their dead animals

Anew 
Hitcher's 

guide 
by robert leone 
hiatul staff writer 

Douglas Adams, the writer 
of the four volume science 
fiction trilogy, has written an-
other absurdist science fiction 
novel. In this work, Adams 
links Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 
the Romantic poet, to extra-
terrestials. He explains why 
the Dodo bird is extinct and 
the Coelacanth fish isn't. And 
the ending ensures that readers 
know there's a sequel coming. 

The reader can only trust 
that Adams knows what he's 
doing. Fortunately, Adams 
does know what he's doing, 
and leaves few loose ends, 
although his social comment-
ary can be rather ohvious. 

The plot begins with a 
Hitchcockian quest by a com-
puter programmer to clear him-
self of the murder of his boss. 
From there, it quickly gets 
complicated, and quite ab-
stract. Fortunately , Adams 
never once derails his story, 
although some of the sub-
plots and side plots seem to 
have been authored by a sleep~ 
writer. 

One problem with Adams 
is that you have to suspend a 
lot of disbelief when reading 
his books. Such items as an 
Electric Monk, which believes 

spend time believing in your-
self, and a computer program 
that will take the most illogical 
conclusion and prove it's the 
right conclusion (immediately 
purchased by the Pentagon), 
abound in Adam's latest rome. 

And then there are the social 
and political messages hidden 
in the text. Take for example, 
that program that validates 
erroneous conclusions. In the 
novel, this program is being 
used by the Pentagon to fund 
501 and several other ques-
tionable programs. There is 
also a best-selling program 
that converts a company's fi -
nancial spreadsheet into music. 

To understand this novel 
completel y, one should have a 
strong grasp of British idioms. 
The need isn't as desperate as 
with "The Hitchhiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy," but it is there . 

While Adams has attracted 
a strong, almost cult-like fol-
lowing, his books are not for 
everyone. They are amusing, 
sometimes deep, and have a 
strong comic style. They some-
times seem sophomoric, shal-
low, and can be infuriatingly 
irritating. If you're a Douglas 
Adams fan, I recommend this 
book without hesitation. If 
you're not, I recommend it 
with considerab le reservation.

mation, they've released their 
e ondalbum entitled, "If You 

Want to Defeat Your Enemy 
ing His ong." UnfOFtun, 

atel , due to the album' in' 
consl tent and primaril bland 
melodie ,it falls hort of what 
hould have been a much 

better follow,up to their 19 
debut. 

Formed In Llverp 01 In 
19 I, the Icicle Work Jumped 
Into the bios ming Bml h 
new mu ic cene al ng Ide 
band uch a E ho and the 
Bunnymen and ew Order. 
Srortlng pal ley robe and 
tlower outfit, Icicle Work 
were quicklv labeled, "hip, 
pie " and "Buddhists ." A ' 
companying their un onven, 
tlonal attire they relea ed a 
elf,produced psy hedeli 

Single, "Nirvana." The ong 
received ignificant ucce s, 
and instantly record com pan, 
ies were banging on their door. 
The England based Begars Ban, 
que t label won them over. 

On their new label they 
released their most popular 
single to date, "Birds Fly 
(Whisper a Scream)." The 
song received tremendous air, 
play around the world, and 
helped strengthen the release 
of their first album in 19 3. 
Self,titled, the album was a 
hard,hitting first effort which 
was both critically and pop' 
ularly received. The album 
quickly catapulted them to 
cult stardom. Produced by 
Hugh Jones, the album sold 
over 20,000 copies and lead 
to a world tour, opening dates 
for The Pretenders, and, in 
some cases, headlining their 
own shows. 

Four years later, guitari t, 
singer, and songwriter, Ian 
McNabb; ba player , Chri 
Layhe; and drummer Chri 
Sharro k, teamed up with new 
produ er Ian Broudie to record 
thei r s cond album. Preceded 
by the release of two very 
popula r singles, "Under, 
standing Jane" and "Evange, 
line," Icicle Works once again 

regained their status in the col-
lege and new music market. 

The best song on the albu m, 
and perhaps one of the cat h, 
iest and mo t likeable new 
songs in years, "Understan, 
ding Jane," blends Sharro k 's 
heavy beat and McNabb's pow' 
erful vocals to form an unfor, 
gettable sounding melody . 
When McNabb thrusts into 
the song's chorus, one can ' t 
help fighting the urge to croon 
along, '''Cos I still want her, I 
still remember summer/Way 
back when , we both felt the 
same/ And I still love her, I 
can't stop thinking of her I l'm 
having trouble understanding 
Jane." "Evangeline," a simi, 
larly structured song, again 

J 
ights the band's talent for 

writing for -eful melodi tunes. 
Aside from tho e 2 ongs, 

the album, " If You Want To 
Defeat Your Enemy ing His 

ong," is a mesh of low rather 
annoyi ng love song . This is 
where the band loses the flare 
exhibited in their previou 
work. M Nabb's voice be, 
comes almost unbearable as 
he moans out the drab lyrics 
of " When You Were Mine" 
and "Travelling Chest." While 

several tracks sound promising 
such as, " Hope Springs Eter, 
nal " and "Sweet Thursday, " 
McNabb's "dragging" voice 
once again ruins them and 
turns them into monotonous 
and irritating laments. 

It's a shame that a band so 
capable of making ood, fresh 
music , doesn't stick to it's 
formula for producing upbeat, 
enjoyable songs. Aside from 
the exceptional tracks, "Un, 
derstandingJane" and "Evan, 
geline," Icicle Works have pro-
duced an inconsistent and pri-
marily boring effort. Maybe 
next time they'll listen to their 
earlier material and see what it 
is that makes Icicle Works 
work.

Moods 

by david b. forman 
hiatus staff writer 

A fine wine improves with 
age, while a bad wine turns to 
vinegar. Van Morrison, one of 
the less celebrated survivors 
of the 1960's, is producing 
musi that falls somewhere in 
between. His latest effort, 
"Poetic Champions Com, 
pose," puts Morrison on fami, 
liar ground , caught in the 
mystic between jazz and ro, 
manti ism. 

A criti will say that Van 
Morrison i stuck in a groove, 
and a fan will ay that Morri on 
is the model of consistency. 
Both are right. "Poeti Cham, 
pion cmp e" flows effort, 
Ie sly fro m the stereo with the 
same dream' like quality that 
made Morr i on a big hit in the 
late 1960' and early 1970's. 
There are no surprises here 
and nothing really new; there 
is just a collection of eleven 

ngs that could be confu ed 
with several o ther Morrison 
albums produced over the last 
two decades. 

Morrison i playing it safe, 
and sticking to what he does 
best; and despite the above 
criticisms, the album really is 
good. Anyone who has ever 
dimmed the lights and lit a fire 
in the fireplace in attempt to 
create a romantic mood knows 
that Van Morrison is the one 

Images 
with paint; using the old photo, 
graphic process of platinum 
palladium printing. Many a 
vanquished beast is preserved 
for service in what the artists 
term a conflicting "approach, 
avoidance" puzzle: there is a 
pig in a bottle, there is an 
octopus nailed to a wall, and 
there are several animals just 

ingredient to make the setting 
perfect. 

If Morrison's music has han, 
ged with age , it has mellowed. 
Every song on "Poetic Cham, 
pions Compose" could be la, 
belled a ballad; the downside 
being that the songs tend to 
blend together. Without lis, 
tening closely, the whole 
album will pass you by without 
notice at all. These songs are 
more like interludes, or dif, 
fe rent impressions of the same 
song. 

There are a few exceptions. 
"Give Me My Rapture" has a 
refre hing hint of gospel which 
i pleasant , though the album 
on the whole i too mellow for 
the song to get off the ground. 
The ame holds true for "The 
My tery" which is the tnost 
likely candidate to be the first 
single off the album. The ong 
get going, but it can't sustain 
its energy. it's almo t a if Van 
Morrison couldn't find th 
energy within him to make 
these songs what they should 
have been. 

Ultimately " Poetic Cham, 
pion Compose" is neither 
worthy of praise nor criticism. 
It is just there, minding its 
own business. If you want to 
become a Van Morrison fan, 
pick up "Moondance" or 
"Wavelength." If you already 
have those albums and want 
something to study by or fall 
asleep to, then this album is 
just as good as any of his other 
recent albums.
