Interdisciplinary Research 

Computer Model Project Proposed 
By JAMES MULLlNER 
Guardian Intern 

Students from such diverse 
departments as philosophy and 
physics may soon be rubbing 
elbows with each other if a prop-
osal by the Project on Neural 
Computation is accepted by the 
University. 

tion of semi-autonomous entities 
and parallel processing of large 
amounts of data are common to 
these subjects and models per-
formed on digital computers have 
proved unsatisfactory. New com-
puters that work in similar ways 
need to be built to overcome 
existing problems, he said. 

Currently the project's steering 
committee is seeking funds and 
equipment to set up a working 
area on campus in as short as ix 
months. Elman expects industrial 
affiliates. the Army and various 

science foundations to provide 
some of the support for the pro-
ject both in terms of funding and 
equipment. 

If the proposal is accepted, a 
center will be built to house com-
puter facili t ies, labs, and experi-
mental equipment that various 
groups can use in research on 
neural computation. Training 
programs for students will also be 
developed. 

The minimum time frame for 
completion would be three to five 
years.

V.P. External Race 
Continues, A.S. Board 
Repeals Initial Decision 

By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

The battle for the po ition of 
A.S. vice president external con-
tinues, de pite a decision by the 
A.S. Judicial Board last Thurs-
day that candidate M ishka Migacz 
will fill that position. 

An agreement reached on Fri-
day voided that declaration, and 
said Migacz's opponent, Craig 
Peters, would resume the position 
upon filing a complaint form with 
the Board. 

Peters' hold on the office is, 
however, contingent upon a Board 
hearing to be held on Tuesday, to 
con ider a case originally che-
duled for last Thur day. 

Last Thur day' abortive hear-
ing was to have been a review of a 
previous case heard by an A.S. 
Election Committee's board of 

began, Peters requested that it be 
held at a later date, on the grounds 
that he was unprepared to present 
his case because he had thought 
the hearing was "only for new 
evidence," rather than a complete 
review of the case. 

Judicial Board Chairperson Jon 
Berke announced that the hearing 
would go on as scheduled despite 
Peters' request, but did allow a 
lO-minute recess for Peters to 
prepare his case. 

When the Board reconvened 
after its recess, Burke announced 
that becau e Peter had not filled 
out a complaint form the Board 
had reque ted be ubmitted by 
May 8, there was no complaint 
against Migacz. Berke then ruled 
that Migacz be allowed to fill the 
po ition of vice president external. 

In an interview with the 
Guardian, Berke said that the 
Board "began the case, and a 

inquiry. minute or two into it we realized 
In that case, which was held that we don't have a complaint." 

April 24, the board of inquiry After issuing the tatement 
found Migacz guilty on three declaring Migacz vice president 
counts of A.S. election bylaw vio- external, the Board went into 
lation then filed by her oppo- closed session. 
nent, Craig Peters. The board Berke said that "Upon further 
then declared Peters the vice pre - con ideration, in all fairness to 
ident external, despite Migacz's both parties and in the best !nter-
having captured the popular vote 
with 809 votes to Peters' 805. See EXTER NAL, page! 

Migacz was accused of not ToN ted 
reporting campaign flyers, solicit- W 0 
ing for votes at Muir College in 
violation of posting rules, and Pro~s D I· e 
breaking several A.S. bylaws by I.: 
appearing at a Women's Re ource _ 
Center rally on an election day. 

Migacz appealed the board's 
decision to the A.S. Judicial 
Board, which convened Thur day 
to hear the case. .

Two noted UCSD faculty mem-
bers died early this month. 

Stefen E. Warschawski, the 
founding chairperson of UCSD's 
mathematics department, was 85 
at the time of his death. 

The goal of the project, headed 
by Terrence J. Sejnowski, profes-
sor of biology and physics at 
UCSD and director of the Labor-
atory of Computational Neuro-
biology at the Salk Institute, is to 
create an interdisciplinary insti-
tute of neural computation at 
UCSD. 

Neural computation is con-
cerned with developing computer 
model that are based on the 
human brain. It i a fast-growing 
field with applications that cut 
acros many areas of re earch. 

A.S. Officers Air Views on Allocation 
Of Price Center Space to Administration 

Warschawski was hired by 
UCSD in 1963 and, although he 
retired to the position of emeritus 
professor in 1971, he remained 
active both professionally and 
ocially in the mathematic com-

munity. 

According to Professor Jeffrey 
Elman of the linguistic and cog-
nitive cience departments, there 
have been "a lot of people on 
campus who have been very 
actively involved in the use of arti-
ficial and real neural networks for 
many different topic ." 

These topic range from low 
level interests uch a the work-
ings of neural tis ue to higher lev-
el involving language, planning, 
and other cognitive functions. 
Artificial intelligence, fluid d nam-
ics, and market behavior are al 0 
involved .

Students and A.S. officers 
have recently expressed con-
cern over the use of the Price 
Center by the administration. 

New A.S. Pre ident John 
Ramirez feels that space allo-
cated in the Price enter is 
crucial to the intere ts of the 
tudent . 
"It i too early to tell if it i 

advantageou to have admin-
istration in the ame building 
[as tudent office]. If the 
administration i located in the 
Price enter to watch over the 
tudent government, then that 

is not beneficial," Ramirez said. 
"The main concern is if student-
run entrepreneurial ventures 
will have room to grow," he 
added. 

Student Advocate Bard-Alan 
Finlan also expres ed concern 
over administration office 
space in the Price Center. He 
believe students must protect 
their access to pace in the 
student-financed enter. 

"Administrator should not 
have office in the [Price en-
ter]. tudent have paid a great 
deal of the co t of the enter," 
he aid . 

Finlan does feel, howe er, 
that ome administrator and 
vital taff member hould be 

allowed to have offices there. 
But, Finlan said, "there i very 
little left over for tudents," 
considering that three paces 
in the Center are taken up by 
the Univer ity Bookstore and 
other areas are reserved for 
food vendor, a travel agency, 
and admini trative offices. 

Al 0 upsetting to Finlan are 
the cla e being held in the 
theater and ballroom area of 
the Price Center. 

"Thi could limit the time 
available for free peech and 
planned tudent event," he 
remarked.

He was recalled to active duty 
many time over the years to 
teach at both UCSD and San 
Diego State University. 

Warschawski wa one of the 
world's leading experts in the 
mathematical theory of complex 
analy is. 

John B. Welsh, who wa 68 
when he died , wa a widely 
re ' pected pediatrician who e 
career panned four decade. 

Welsh wa a clinical professor 
of pediatric at the UC D chool 
of Medicine, and played a major 
role in the development of the 
department of pediatric during 
the chool' founding year. 

He erved a acting chairper-
on of the department from 1967 

to 1969.

U CSB Student Charged With Theft, 
Accuses Officer With Brutality 

SA TA BARBARA - A UCSB student arrested 
for allegedly stealing a foot patrol bicycle has filed a 
uit, accusing a Santa Barbara Sherifrs Department 

deputy of police brutality. 
UC B fre hper on teve Feehan was charged with 

petty theft and jo riding at 11:35 p.m. on March 4 -
an accusation which Feehan denies. Feehan claim 
that while making the arrest, Isla Vista Foot Patrol 
Deputy Karl Koeller unnecessarily struck him on the 
back of the head with a baton. 

After his arrest, Feehan was taken to the foot 
patrol office and later to a local hospital for treatment 
of a two-inch cut. He was given a citation at the 
hospital and released. 

Feehan insist that he was not attempting to teal 
Koeller's bicycle, but was moving it because it was 
blocking his own parked bicycle which he said was 
behind the deputy's. 

Deputy Koeller's report de cribes a male uspect 
looking around furtively before hopping on a foot 
patrol bike. Koeller says that he yelled, "Sherifr 
Department. you're under arrest for stealing my 
bike!" 

The report aid Koeller did not perceive a 
satisfactory response and grabbed Feehan by the neck 
and shoulders and threw him to the ground . While 
trying to handcuff Feehan, Koeller allegedly hit Fee-
han once in the head, and approximately four more 
times in the back. When Koeller read Feehan his 
rights at the hospital. Feehan reportedly waived them 
and allegedly said he "sort or' stole the bike, Koeller' 
report states.

UCSB Officials Enact Temporary 
Alcohol Ban During Pub Nite 

SANTA BARBARA - On most Thursday 
evenings, UCSB students flock to the University . 
Center (UCen) for Pub Nite in The Pub, but durmg 
the first week in May, they stayed away. 

Hours before Pub Nite began, officials enacted a 
temporary alcohol ban in response to recent incidents 
which raised questions about the adequacy of Pub 
security and the serving of alcohol at concerts. 

The decision was made at a meeting between 
representatives of the UCSB Alumni Associated, 
UCS B Police, Associated Students Program Board,

future Pub ites. 

One member of the decision-making panel 
expres ed concern over recent incidents that occurred 
in the UCSB Pub. He referred to two separate cases: 
one in which an individual attending Pub Nite was 
caught with a loaded handgun and another in which 
patrons were arrested after a Beatnigs concert in The

Candidates in UCLA Races Accused 
of Violating Election Codes 

LOS ANGELES - Two candidates in UCLA's 
ndergraduate Student Association elections received 

penalties May 3 after being accused of breaking the 
undergraduate election code while campaigning. 

Second vice-pre idential candidate Alec Wynne and 
facilities commissioner candidate Spencer Schneider 
were both sanctioned. 

Wynne could not campaign between I and 3 p.m. 
because some of his supporters were reportedly found 
in a Life Science building, handing out endorsements 
and weari'l)g sandwich boards. Campaigning inside 
buildings violates the election board's policy and U ni-
versity policy. 

chneider could not campaign between I and 2 
p.m. because he reportedly held a room party in a res-
idence hall with the door open. According to the Elec-
tion Board I nvestigations chairperson, Chris Flosi, 
an open door makes a room party a public event and 
this is not allowed. 

Wynne claimed that he knew of no supporters 
campaigning in the building at the time of the alleged 
event, but reported that the penalty did not hurt his 
campaign. chneider claimed that there were so many 
attending the room party that the door could not be 
shut.

This was a typical comment from students running booths at

Sun God Festival was not as successful as it should have been. 

When students arrived at Mile High Field Friday afternoon 
to set up, they discovered that the arrangement of booths was 
terrible, and bore little relation to the plan student organizations 
were told about weeks before. Pedestrian traffic was not easily 
facilitated, and many booths were tucked away, practically 
unnoticable to passers-by. 

One of the reasons for this poor arrangement was the 
"Around the World" theme, with six separate sections: Africa, 
South America, the Far East, the Middle East, Europe and the 
United States. Each section was in its own ring. The theme may 
have been a good idea, but very few booths stuck to it, and the 
confused set up put some booths in great locations, and others in 
terrible ones. 

Making the situation worse was the lack of publicity for the 
event. Budget cuts meant that many people weren't aware of the 
Sun God Festival, or at least weren't aware of it far enough in 
advance to plan to spend the evening there and spend money. 
The turnout was fairly good, but the enthusiasm for the event 
was not at the level of previous years. 

The A .S . was also resistant to the idea of booking a big-name 
band. They didn't want a real concert, but rather a sort of 
" background music." This idea had some merits, but a bigger 
band would have been a better draw, and the Sun God Festival is 
one of. the few opportunities to go all out and put on a great 
event. 

Yet another problem was the handling of money. Customers 
had to buy tickets, and then use the tickets to buy things at the 
booths. It isn't clear that this is justified. Apparently, the original 
idea of the tickets was to ensure that the A .S . got their cut of 
student organizations' profits. But this year, the A .S . is just 
taking a flat fee. The argument that the tickets stop a lot of cash 
from floating around breaks down in view of the additional 
trouble, the absence of such a policy at Open House. and the 
unfortunate fact that virtually every booth accepted cash any-
way. The tickets should be eliminated next year. 

There were some factors the A .S. didn't have control over -
such as the cold, cloudy weather - but overall the Sun God 
Festival could have been a much more successful event. Student 
organizations will have to just take their losses, and hope the 
Festival is better organized next year.

Many cancer patients, diabetics,

Animal research allows scien-

be done in a test tube. AIDS 
research is a good example. Scien-

not healthy cells . After finding 
these effects in a laboratory, 
scientists had to test for possible

Abortion and Vivisection 
Editor: 

There appears to be two hot 
debates on the minds of protesters 
today: abortion and vivisection. 

In response to the five people 
asked about Roe v. Wade in "Q & 
A" (Guardian, May II), I'd like to 
say a couple of things. To Eugene 
Chu: God did not give us the right 
to make a life or death decision. 
"Thou shalt not kill." To Stepha-
nie Dietrich: If a woman had 
control over her body, how did 
she get pregnant in the first place? 
To Dylan Hardwood: The death 
"penalty" is imposed on those 
who choose to kill viciously. 
Fetuses do not have such a choice. 
Fetuses are killed . To John Tsai: 
Overturning a Supreme Court 
decision so that states can decide 
does not solve the problem. People 
can just drive to another state 
(Nevada is only about seven hours 
away). 

The only person I agree with 
out of the five is Kerry Mark. If it 

were made illegal, people would 
do it anyway. Overturning it, how-
ever, would decrease the number 
of fetuses that are killed. People 
would do it dangerously, but 
would people think twice before 
they hop into beq with someone 
else? I think so. 

Without the security of an 
abortion clinic, people would be 
more wise about using protection, 
i.e . condoms. AIDS and other 
sexually transmitted viruses would 
not be as widespread as they now 
are. Unwanted pregnancy would 
not occur as often. Remember 
that even heterosexuals have 
AIDS and the number is in-
creasing. Making it difficult on 
people would change a lot . They 
may have to go to Europe to have 
an abortion done safely. If people 
do not have abortion as an 
alternate choice in America, they 
will think twice about having 
casual sex (that is, if they think at

ability. I find it terribly ironic that 
countries who voted for the reso-
lution condemning Israel's actions 
in the occupied territories have 
been singled out by Amnesty 
International as having abysmal 
human rights records . These na-
tions include Syria, Saudi Arabia, 
Libya, and Iraq, all supporters of 
the PLO or some faction within 
it. 

In addition, these nations a-
mong others in the Middle East 
refuse to recognize Israel's right 
to exist and have not only called 
for the dismantling of the state, 
but the extermination of its peo-
ple. These so-called freedom-
loving nations have decided that 
the Palestinians deserve rights that 
they won't even give their own 

people, or the Israelis for that 
mailer. The General Assembly in 
their arbitrary condemnations of 
Israel show themselves as hypo-
crites. 

Ms. Creelman, if you stop 
watching NBC and start looking 
at this terrible situation for what 
it is, you just may find that tyrants 
cannot be appeased. Every day in 
Israel is typified by a fight for sur-
vival. For 41 years, the Arabs 
have refused to recognize Israel's 
right to exist, and have received 
nothing. Is it a wonder that they 
have decided to change their tac-
tics? Now they have gOllen world 
opinion against Israel in an at-
tempt to get the West Bank and 
Gaza. If they get it, they will 

. attempt to dismantle Israel. If you 
don't believe me, listen and read 
what their leaders have to say.

By A. M. BEZZERIDES 
Training Direc/or 

Perhaps we all thought that the Sigma Alpha 
Mu fraternity's stripper event and its implica-
tions had been run into the ground . Well, recent 
words around campus and a letter written to the 
Guardian by a woman who couldn't see anything 
wrong with a stripper are indications that we 
need to set straight what the event and its after-
math really mean. 

In this letter Victoria Dunkley called students 
pathetic because they "get so huffy about such 
incredibly unimportant things." Pathetic maybe 
would describe her attitude. Dunkley fails to see 
what it means to have a huge roomful of men, 
representing college students and men as a whole, 
give in to the ingrained cultural values that place 
women in subservient positions. 

Dunkley went on to ask if "any of the women 
on this campus felt any repercussions from this 
event?" She answered, "I think not." How about

Sexism is Ingrained 
in Our Society 

this : Have any women on this campus ever been 
date-raped, sexually harrassed, or forced to do 
anything sexual against their will? I think so. 

It is this type of acceptance of the stripper that 
perpetuates the stereotype that women want to be 
dominated, forced and abused. In a Ms. maga-
zine report on date and acquaintance rape, 59 
percent of the college men interviewed believed 
that women provoke rape by their appearances. 
Half-naked oil wrestling sure seems to back this 
up, doesn't it? 

We can't just blame the fraternity . Look at 
society around us. For two years we all watched 
Maddie and David on "Moonlighting" play 
around with the idea of getting together sexually. 
In the last much-awaited show, what happens? 
They have a fight, she calls him a bastard, slaps 
him in the face; he calls her a bitch. The next thing 
we see after the two battle furiously is Maddie 
"getting" what every viewer thinks women want: 
she collapses into sexual ecstasy. 

The problem is everywhere you look - in ads, 
beauty contests, literature. Everything we do to 
accept these things adds to the misconception 
that women want men to take them over sexually. 

Yes, the fraternity has apologized, and we can

Vivisection does not cause pain, 
suffering, or the like to animals . I 
know since I help in disease 
research for animals . Animals are 
euthanized quietly, with the use of 
chloroform and electricity . With-
out animallesting, vast numbers 
of people as well as other animals 
would have died of painful 
diseases. 

In Auschwitz, humans, Jews, 
were the research animals. How-
ever, they did not die peacefully in 
a cloud of choloroform. They 
died painfully in a cloud of nerve 
gas. The incinerators burned for-
ever. The Nazis did find out some 
medical advances, like how dyeing 
the iris of the cye does not change 
eye color. Human testing cost 
millions of human lives. Research 
today is useful - not stupid . 

Do we need to make America a 
new Auschwitz in order to test 
our medical advances? Do not 
forget that animals do not scream 
in pain when they die. They sleep, 
forever . Youcan'ttestadrugona 
mannequin; it does not work! 

So if you Ihink we should leave 
abortion be and you protest vivi-
section, you have a contradictive 
mind. Think of il this way : 
abortion is a pre-natal form of 
vivisection. The fetus , instead of 
growing up to be somebody's best 
friend, somebody's spouse, some-
body's parent, is sucked down 
in to the bowels of a pseudo-
vacuum cleaner and left to die. 

Support your own animal 
species first.

Sexism 
Continued from pale S 
hope that having been attacked 
by the Women's Resource Center 
identifed for them what was 
wrong about having a lecture hall 
full of men watching a woman 
offer her breasts to be violated in 
a way that left her dominated by 
many. However, the misconcep-
tions are still heavily ingrained. 

Last week I overheard a man in 
casual conversation enumerating 
"women's issues ." "What are 
women's issues?" he asked. "Rape 
is one," he answered . This wasn't 
coming from a sexist or even a 
stupid man. However, he stands 
for , perhaps innocently, the in-
credible number of false ideas 
about rape and male-female roles . 

Rape b not a women's issue. It 
is our society's problem - men 
and women. 

Men and women have to deal 
with the problem. When a woman 
gets raped she is some man's sis-
ter, mother, daughter, girlfriend, 
or wife. Given that rape affect 
both sexes, both sexes have to do 
something about it . 

Men have to communicate 
with women, not just the women 
that they are dating, but also 
women around them who can tell 
them how they feel and should be 
treated . Men should also com-
municate with men. Don't be 
afraid to step in when someone is 
speaking about women as com-
modities: MShe wouldn't give me 
any. " 

And in the same respect women 
have to communicate wilh men: 
ones they date, and ones around 
them . And that doesn't mean that 
one has to be a militant feminist 
to convey that humans are not 
sexual objects. 

Women don't want to be dom-
inated, but until everyone does 
their part to change inlernalized 
misconceptions of our culture that 
surround us, men and women are 
going to have to face the results of 
rape and sexual harassment.

Wall Writing: Vandalism or 
'An Outlet for Anxieties?' 

By MARLA SCHNEIDMAN 
Comribul ing Wrill'r 

"Old Peeps never die; they keep 
coming back," wrote a member of 
a group on campus known as the 
UC D wall writers. 

For over 15 year, these wall 
writer have writte n and painted 
messages in the stairwells of 
elected building on campus. 

They have not only establi hed a 
tradition unique to UCSD but 
have also created a mode of 
comm u nication which allows 
people to expre s themselve in a 
non-threatening atmo phere. 

The UCSD wall writers date 
back to the early sevenlle when a 
group of people jusl tarted 

Bryan BUytu Guardian 

writing on the walh of bUildings 
located at Muir College. The 
buildings included P&L, H&SS, 
AP&M and eventually branched 
out to Mandeville and H L 

"People started noticing that 
the writing was gelling regular," 
explained "Psimon," a wall writer 
offouryears. -Eventually people just 
caught on." Another writer known 
as" ightshade, " who started three 
years ago as a Ireshperson, was 
pass ing through the stairwells in 
P&L and noticed all of the writing. 
" I found it quite interesting. It 
was clearly systematic graffiti." 

Other writers discovered the 

Bryan Bilytu/ Guardian 
walls du ring freshperson o rienta-
tion. "At fi rst I thought it was 
someth ing that the Univer ity had 
sanctioned,"-Fracu "explained. - It 
didn't occur to me that this was 
illegal, that it was not looked 
upon favorably by the Regents." 

The group is structured int o 
"familie ." The first fami ly con-
si ts of the first group of wri ters. 
There is a family tree in the stair-
wells of AP&M with the names of 
several generations worth of wri-
ter . 

"Every family is different ; they 
ha ve a different emphasis," ex-
plained "Psimon. ""One year there 
wa Grateful Dead imagery all 
over the walls. Another group of 
writers was into Monty Python. 
Some of the grou ps are concurrent 
because a lot of the concerns are 
still the same. " 

Most of the writers who engage 
in wall communication choose to 
use a pen name. Some decide to 
make themselves publicly known 
to other wall writers while others 
choose to remain anonymous. 
"After awhile, you are going to 
meet other writer ," "Psimon" 
said. "It's inevitable." 

The wri ters come to the wa lls 
with d ifferent goals in mind. Many 
people come to the walls hoping to 
make frie nds. " It's a tremend ous 
opport unity to meet people that 

Sun God F •• tlv.1 - The annual Sun God Festival 'was 
held last Friday on Mile High Field. More than 80 student 
organizations participated In the festivltes, which culminated 
In a dance in the gym. The money generated by the Sun God 
Festival is donated to the Abused Chlldren's Foundation. The 
Festival had a dlslinctly internatIOnal character, as seen In the 
diverSity of its participants. Among the featured events were a 
taekwondo demonstrallon (upper left), a boolh by the Armen-
ian Club (upper rig hi ), the band Mango Bang (center left). a 
booth by the Koala (center), and Niloufar Korshid in the Sun 
God (bottom right). 

sha re a similar mentality," ex-
plained "Kat," who has been 
writing since the beginning, of this 
year. "It's a diverse enough group 
that there was no way you would 
have met these people otherwise." 

The walls brought more than 
friendship for two writers : one 
cur~ently married couple, with 
a child , met at the walls ! Others 
write on the walls to reach out for 
support. "I started writing with a 
di stinctive purpose in mind ," 
" Psimon" explained . "I came to 
t he wa ll to sort out my problem 
a nd to fi nd a place where I 
belong." 

"People don't start writing for 
the hell of it ," " N ightshade," 
said. "At least the people who 
stick around ." Certain individuals 
wall write because they are anti -
social and fee l the wall is an open 
arena in which to communicate. 
Some .:njoy the role-pl aying 
aspect of taking on multiple a liases 
and creati ng personas. 

There are also those who li ke to 
write as sort of a thrill. " I got 
myself into it as a mailer of 
adventure," another writer said. 

"There is a certain tendency 
among a subset of writers to want 
to learn how to get into places 
where we aren't up posed to be," 
"Nightshade" said. 

"It's more of a sel f-e ntertaining 
thing anymor.e than it is to dis-
seminate wisdom, ""Fracus" said. 

The fact that some students 
wri te for a thrill is troublesome 
for one student. "Like the sub-
ways on ew York , there is some 
neat stuff but most of it is gar-
bage. It's elf- erving and pseudo-
art istic . Some writers are con-
fined to playing stupid little social 
games rather than having some-
thing profound to say." 

.ryan .lIy~u l 
Some of the writers commented 

that the earlier writings and 
imagery which seemed to evoke 
more emotion in the reader were 
painted over a few years ago, but 
that there is still a lot of interesting 
material being written today. 

There is a wide range of material 
that is displayed on the walls; 
political and social issues abound 
as well as personal concerns a bout 
life. One writer made a list of 
"Things that are gonna get You" 

which included such items as 
"killer bees, bad grade , AIDS, 
Freddy, and st.atic cling." Other 
people quote poem a nd songs 
of other art ists, while there 
are those that contemplate life 
through their own poetry or love

SoMony Students, 
So Few Blacks 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Spans Editor 

Black students comprise only 
three percent of this year's fresh-
person class, the same as last year. 
Various reasons blacks are not 
attracted to UCSD have been 
given, including the school's loca-
tion in affluent , white, suburban 
La Jolla and its lack of a business 
administration program. 

This is part two of a two-part exami-
nation of black students at UCSD. 
Part one appeared on May 11. 

On the other hand, many Stu-
dent Affirmative Action students 
who decided to enroll elsewhere 
cited financial reasons as major 
factors in their decisions. They 
perceived UCSD costs to be too 
high, did not receive financial aid, 
or were not offered any scholar-
ships. 

Though many administrators 
and staff were hesitant to point it 

' out as a factor, another main rea-
son for black students not choos-
ing UCSD is the lack of a "big 
time" sports program. 

UCSD boasts perhaps the best 
overall Division III intercollegiate 
sports program in the country, 
but this seems to have little bear-
ing·among the students. Because 
UCSD competes on the Division 
III level with small schools, the 
athletic program rarely gets any 
national recognition or media 
ilUention - qualifications which 
usually render a school "big time" 
for sports. 

Though UCSD has a great 
overall program, it has its prob-
lems with the two sports that 
receive the most media attention 
- men's basketball and football. 
UCSD's men's basketball team is 
among the worst in its league, and 
the school does not even field an 
intercollegiate football squad . 

"They told me they had foot-
ball at this school when I app-
lied ," Muir fre hperson Rich 
Stroter said. "But I had no idea 
they meant intramural football. 
Hey, as fara as I'm concerned, if 
there's no football, there [are] no 
sports. " 

Walter Scranton, the head 
counselor at San Diego High 
Sc hool , focu sed directl y on 
UCLA 's basketball program a a 

primary reason fo r a number of 
blacks choos ing that school over 
UCSD. "They ee blacks making 
a name fo r themselves on the bas-
ketball court over at UC LA, and 
they wa nt to be associated with 
that university. Role models, 
especially where athletics come 
into play, are a major influence in 
college selection." 

Whatever the reason, blacks 
are not attending UCSD. Accord-
ing to one black student who 
wished to remain anonymous, it 
is no a surprise that blacks are not 
attracted to UCSD. "Why would 
[blacks] want to come here? one 
of the social events are very geared 
towards blacks .. . What about the 
bands that play at the TGs? I 
don't want to hear that stuff. 
They gear everything towards 
whites. " 

Stroter also pointed to lack of 
black-focused events as detrimen-
tal to black enthusiasm. Even 
though he belongs to nearly all 
the black groups on campus and 
plans to join Alpha Phi Alpha, a 
black fraternity which includes 
members from all over San Diego, 
Stroter still feels isolated . 

"Being a part of all these groups 
and knowing almost every black 
person on this campus is a good 
feeling because I always have 
people I can relate to and hang 
out with," Stroter said . "But 
nothing gives you a good feeling 
when you walk into a study ses-
sion and suddenly everybody in 
the room gets quiet. You begin to 
feel like you're a spectacle or 
something. " 

Many white students do not 
claim to take any particular notice 
of black students at UCSD. "I 
don't really notice[black students] 
that much," said Lee Madrid , a 
white student. "I just think about 
themjust as I do any other person 
- they're people, and I don't care 
what color they are." 

Color blindness in this sense is 
good for the most part, but it can 
also lead to problems - espe-
cially in the case of neglect. The 
lack of black-focu sed eve nt s 
spo ored by the University or the 
student is just one indication that 
black students are ignored at 
UCSD. 

"They don't do anything for 
us, "explained Stroter. "If it wasn't 
for my major , I would've trans-
ferred . I hate this school." 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES M onday, May / 5, 1989 9 

Writing on the Walls " I've stopped writi ng because I feel that I no lo nger need the walls 
and because I V!ant to give others 
a chance to write,""Psim on"said. 

One writer fee ls that since the 
wa ll don't belong to him, it's a 
privilege to be putting stuff up. 
"You can 't reall y complain. You 
get used to it. It also serves a 
function because the walls get 
cluttered . What I regret is when 
something rea lly good gets wiped 
out." 

Continued from page 8 
ballads. 

In addition, there is a lot of 
"chit-c hat " type conversatio n 
between the writers on the walls. 
Some of the writers tell how they 
started writing and how long they 
have been writing. On walls in 
different buildings one can find 
"roll calls" where the people who 
are currently active sign their pen' 
names and the date . 

Anyone who wants to become 
a wall writer is able to do so. The 
only criteria is a good pen and the 
desire to write your thoughts down 
on a wall. "It's sort of a clique, 
but it's an easily entered clique," 

UNIVERSITY 

explained " Kat." "It's no t at a ll 
exclusive. " 

"It 's difficult to be exclusive 
when there is a certain d egree of 
a nonymity a nd because it is hard 
to get everyone togethe r as a 
group," "Fracus" said. 

There is no set time or number 
of days per week that writers go to 
the walls . Some writers prefer to 
go at night because there are usu-
ally more writers then while oth-
ers go at various points in the day. 
Some of the writers exercise their 
pens several times a week yet oth-
ers have been dormant for awhile 
because they just don't have any-
thing to say. 

For those writers that have 
spent a lot of time thinking about 
what t hey writ e and have no other 
written records, it can be a trauma-
tic experience when something 
gets painted over. The same holds 
true for artists who worked hard 
to crea te an image for others to 
appreciate. 

" It 's a horrifying feeling when 
something gets painted over, 
especially if it's things that I 
valued ," " N ightshade" said . 
" When something gets painted 
over, everyone is depre ed and 
shocked for a few days even 
though we knew it was coming." 

Li ke most groups, the wall 
writers have had their share of 
nasty comments and stereotypical 
remarks. "Many people think that 
we write to ma ke waves, that we 
are rebellious in nature," "Psi-
mon" said . "Actuall y, we like to 
keep a low profile." 

There is a underlying agreement 
among the wall wri ters about 
what is considered appropriate 
behavior. The wall writers try not 

to be di. ruptive or obnox ious and 
agree not to hurt or insult anybody 
else. 

It is also known that they must 
stay within the stairwells of t he 
buildings that have already been

The UCSD Guardian 

Wall 
Writers 
Continued from page'9 
written on. "There is an acquies-
cence by the authority that they 
will tolerate it , but that we still 
need to watch ourselves, ""Fracus" 
said. 

The wall writers have, however, 
offended certain individuals on 
this campus in the past. 

In April of 1987, a wall writer 
was arrested in an H&SS stairwell 
after being spotted by history 
Professor Thomas Metzger. The 
professor claimed that the writer 
was vandalizing the property and 
that the writer's behavior was 
immoral and unethical. The pro-
fessor argued that the walls belong 
to the citizens of the community 
and that there can't be a com-
munity unless everyone respects 
each other's rights. 

There was also some trouble in 
the early '80s with Professor 
J . Anthony Deutsch in the psy-
chology department who was 
opposed to the writings going on 
in P&L. . 

The police take action if some-
body reports that there is a 
problem such as the incident two 
years ago. "If we are called to take 
action or we catch somebody 
writing, we'll take some action 
because it is defacing the Regents' 
property and that is something we 
can't condone," explained Detec-
tive Robert Jones of the UCSD 
police department.1We are] here 
as police officers enforcing the 
law in the state of California. If it 
has been reported that UCSD 
property is being damaged, then 
we have to respond as such." 

Since the wall writing has been 
going on for so long, there is an 
informal agreement among Uni-
versity officials and the wall 
writers. "As long as they stay 
within the buildings they've al-
ready written on, we don't have 
too much of a problem," said 
J ohn Stevenson of Physical Plant 
Services on campus. "There would 
be a serious problem, however, if 
the writing started to spread all 
over campus." 

Though some professors do not 
condone the wall writers, Pro-
fessor Marcelo Suarez-Orozco ofthe 
anthropology department feels 
differe ntly. 

"Whether or not you like the 
wall writing is beside the point," 
Suarez-Orozco explained. "The 
writing is a written form of folk-
lore which has psychological and 
symbolic value. The content says 
something about the culture. It 
mirrors certain concerns of the 
people who write. The wall writing 
can be seen as an outlet for 
anxieties dealing with ethnic, 
sexual, and gender-related issues." 

Though there have been /at-
tempts made in the past to dis-
courage this behavior by using 
anti-grafitti paint, the wall writers 
seem to find a way to put their 
messages up on the walls. "As 
soon as something was painted 
over, there was new stuff up on 
the walls," "Nightshade" said. 
"In some instances, there have 
been retaliatory scrubbings of the 
paint. .. 

Whether people like it or not, 
the wall writers of UCSD have no 
intention of disbanding. Some of 
the older members still keep in 
touch with ' the wall writers of 
today and even come back to 
write. The group had a IS-year 
anniversary party on the roof of 
P&L two years ago . 

"The wall writers have been 
fairly quiet this year perhaps due 
to the lack of space, but it goes in 
cycles," "Psimon" said. "You are 
always a wall writer once you 
start. "

Tritons Stunned Twice by Calvin Col/ege 

Softball Eliminated in Michigan Behrens/Calhoun Capture Doubles Championship 
By TRA VIS L. SCOrf 
Staff Writer 

They ay all good things must 
come to an end. For UCSD's 
softball team, the end came much 
ooner than expected. 

Heading into the weekend's' 
NCAA Midwest Regionals at 
Calvin College in Grand Rapids, 
Michigan, second-ranked UCSD 
was the clear favorite in the three-
team double-elimination tourna-
ment. But it was host Calvin Col-
lege (28-5) coming up with two 
upset victories over the Tritons to 
take the prize and advance to the 
next round. 

In their first game on Frida 
afternoon, UCSD routed North 
Central College of l11inois, 9-0, 
and promptly eliminated its team 
from the tournament. The Trit-
on had nine hits in the game and 
Michelle Mundee went two-for-

Shortstop Dana Chaiken 

three and scored twice. Dianna 
Moreno got the win to improve 
her record to 13-3. 

The victory set up a best-of-
three confrontation with Calvin 
College, which had defeated North 
Central earlier in the day. The 
Tritons, riding a 14-game win-
ning streak, played a solid game 

through the first ix innings, hold-
ing the score at 0-0. But in the top 
of the seventh a walk and two 
errors by UCSD opened the door 
for Calvin College and gave it a 
2-0 victory. 

With the loss, the Tritons 
needed two straight victories over 
Calvin on Saturday to advance to 
the next round of the tourna-
ment. But they couldn 't even 
manage one victory. Calvin scored 
three times in the third inning and 
held on to a 3-1 victory. UCSD 
came up with one in the sixth, but 
it was not enough as the Triton 
bats were liminted to only five hits 
on the afternoon. Dianna Moreno 
was charged the loss and fell to 
13-4 on the season, and UCSD 
ended the year with a mark of 
35-9. Kristi Klaasen (23-2) got the 
win for Calvin CoUege. 

Calvin' next game will be May 
18 against top-ranked Trenton 
Collge (28-5) of ew Jersey.

Different day , same results. 
Three day after helping their team win the NCAA Division 

III National Championship, Triton doubles partners Christine 
Behren and Nancy Calhoun finished off Kenyon's Julie Kipka 
and Kathryn Lane to capture the 1989 Division III Women's 
Tennis Double Championship in Claremont, California. En 
route to their championship victory, Behrens and Calhoun 
played and defeated three of the same doubles teams they faced 
during the team tournament a few days before. 

Incidentally, Behrens-Calhoun defeated each of the same 
teams in the doubles championship in the exact order that they 
defeated them in the team championship - after defeating a pair 
from Washington University, Behrens-Calhoun disposed of 
doubles teams from University of the South , Gustavus-
Adolphus, and Kenyon. The Tritons as a team captured the 
National Title in the same way, defeating - in order - Univer-
sity of the south, Gustavus-Adolphus, and Kenyon. 

UCSD has not won a doubles championship since 1985, when 
the Jessica Vernon-Nadine Akimoto team walked away with the 
trophy. 

Women's W-Polo Beats UC Irvine 
Behrens-Calhoun began their journey to the top on Thursday 

afternoon, when they defeated Tracy Peale-Monica Blanco of 
Washington University 7-5,6-0 and then proceeded to trounce 
Ellen Gray-Maybank and Katy Morrissey of the University of 
the South 6-3,6-0 in a rematch of their earlier 6-2, 6-2 contest in 
the first round of the team championship. 

By TRAVIS L. SCOrf 
Staff Writer 

When doe a team know It's 
really good? 

How about when It's ranked 
number one In the nation, score 
21 goals against a f ormida ble 
opponent, holds that team to only 
nine goal , and comes out disap-
pointed which is just what the 
women's water polo team (13-1-1) 
did Friday afternoon when it 
routed UC Irvine 21-9 in the final 
game of the regular season. 

"That just goes to show you 
how extremely high our stand-
ards are," said Coach Denny 
Harper. "Not one person on this 
team is going to tell you that she 
was satisfied with the way we 
played . " 

In the semifinals of the doubles tournament , Behren -Calhoun 
trounced Dianne Sand-Mary Sutherland of Gustavus-
Adolphu . In the team tournament, Behrens-Calhoun did away 
with Sand-Sutherland by a 6-2, 6-3 score. aturday afternoon, it 
wa a 6-2,6-2 re ult and the Triton pair wa back in the finals . 

Behrens-Calhoun dispo ed of Kipka-Lane 6-3,6-4 to capture 
fir t place. However, they got a lucky break by playing Kipka-
Lane in the finals, for the latter managed to upset Pomona-
Pitzer's team of Karen Nilson-Shelley Keeler. Behrens-Calhoun 
10 t both regular- eason meetings with the Nilson-Keeler team. 

In the ingles tournament , Calhoun make it all the way to the 
emifinals before running into Carolyn Bodart of Menlo, 6-0, 

6-1. 
Behrens, who came in ranked fourth in the country in singles, 

feU in the quarterfnals to Karen Cooper of Welle ley College, a 
player she had defeated handily in a regular- ea on contest.

Nevertheless, this one was never 
even a contest. Carin Crawford 
scored the first goal off of an 
a sist from Amanda Palmquist 
just over one minute into the 
match and UCS D never looked 
back. 

Not e chene. - Carin Crawford (7) scored four times Friday. 

"There was never much doubt 
today," Harper said. "We have 
some key player that play key 
postitions and Irvine just doesn't 
match up."

Among those players were 

Crawford, who paced the attack 
with four goals. After letting Irvine 
close the gap to 3-2 in the first 
quarter, the Tritons went on a

Pacific Coast Rowing Championships 

w. Crew Shines inSacto 
Buffeted by a strong how-

ing at the Pacific Coast Row-
ing Championships at Lake 
Nactoma in Sacramento , 
UCS D's women's crew team 
finished its best eason Since 
the event went to 2000 meters 
In 1985 - and perhaps its best 
ever. 

The Varsity Eight squad fin-
ished fifth in the Grand Final 
event with the fa te t time in 

CSD history. Coming in with 
a time of 7: 13, the Triton fin-
Ished 28 seconds behind winner 

Olver ItyofWashington,and 

won the the Western Intercol-
legiate Rowing Association 
Championship which is com-
prised of every rowing team 
outside the Pac-IO. 

The ovice Eight finished 
sixth in the Grand Final with a 
time of 7:35. They finished 27 
second behind winner UC 
Berkeley and O!le second be-
hind WI RA champion U 
Davis. 

The Lightwei~ht Eight fin-
i hed fourth in the Grand Final, 
19 seconds behind winner Wash-
ington State. 

hope for the best. Perhaps with a 
little luck, your name will be 
chosen and you will be named the 
winner. That's the scenario U CS 0 
faces at the Division III National 
Championships in Kalamazoo, 
Michigan. 

Okay, so it's a little more compli-
cated than that. The Triton have 
to play the games. But their chan-
ces of winning the Division III 
National Champion hips are 
about the arne as being drawn 
from a hat. 

"We have a legitimate chance," 
Coach John Hammermeister aid. 
"All 10 teams [entered in the 
tournament] are pretty even 
talent wise, and they all have a 
good chance at winning it. 

"Whoever win the tour-na-
ment ," he continued , "will have to 
play three great days of tenni , 
and catch a few break along the 

way. " 
The sixth-seeded Tritons are 

one of four Pacific Coast teams 
playing in the championships. 
They join top-seeded UC Santa 
Cruz, seventh-seeded Pomona-
Pitzer, and tenth-seeded Clare-
mont-Mudd ina field of 10 teams 
vying for Division III bragging 
right . The otherteams are Swarth-
more, Washington College, Kala-
mazoo, Washington and Lee, The 
University of the South, and 
Brandeis. 

Every team has a genuine 
opportunity to win the tourna-
ment. UC Santa Cruz, considered 
by many to be the favorite, lost 
rookie sensation Eric Ochlshlager, 
who was their No.3 singles player 
and a part of their No. I doubles 
team. Hi s absence dimini he 
UCS ' chances somewhat and 
could open the door for an of the 

other teams. 
A good bet could be second-

eeded Swarthmore. Swarthmore 
returns to the tournament with 
virtually the same team that edged 
UCSD 5-4 en route to a third 
place finish in last year's cham-
pionships. 

Washington College, which 
finished right behind Swarthmore 
in the tourney a year ago, is 
seeded in that same position this 
year. It finished fourth last year, 
and is currently seeded third. 

Fifth- eeded Kalamazoo i prob-
ably one of the weaker teams in 
the tourney talent wise, but it is 
the ho t of the event and will 
benefit from playing in its own 
backyard, with tremendous crowd 
support. 

Washington and Lee is the 
defending national champion.
