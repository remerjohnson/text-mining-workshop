Sixty-seven percent said they preferred "a 
smaller tax cut and increased federal aid to 
states to help maintain funding for public 
schools.' Twenty-five percent said they 
desired "the full $550 billion tax cut pro-
posed by President Bush," 

The survey also found that 64 percent of 
citizens polled support federal aid to states "to 
help reduce the need to raise college tuitions."

the Northeast and weakest in the East, 
according to the PAC.E. survey.

ucop Web site unleashes new link 
Students can now seek help on financial issues 

CRECNO: Davies and Preuss 
join Connerly in 'no' vote 

By LAUREN IAU 
Senior Staff Writer 

The University of California 
Office of the President Web site 
hosts a new link tided, "You can, 
we can help: meeting the financial 
challenges of college." The page 
profiles 12 UC students with vari-
ous financial stresses and how they 
paid for the 2002-03 school year. 

The addition to the site comes 
amidst strained financial times for 
the University of California, with 
students seeing their fees raised at 
the beginning of spring quarter 
2003 and with uncertainty as to 
the level of fees in the future. 

"This almost seems like it's a 
tool for the university to say that 
it's oby for them to increase fees," 
said Steven Klass, University of 
California Student Association 
Chair. 

According to Hanan 
Eisenman , admissions coordinator 
for University of California Office 
of the President, research has 
shown that many low-income tu-
dents lack the information that 
they need regarding financial aid. 

"What this is intended to do is 
demonstnlte for prospective and 
current students the resources 
that are available to them," 
Eisenman said. "It highlights and 
illustrates the mix of resources." 

However, not all interested 
panies perceive this Web site as a 
imple financial aid tool. 

"It does one good thi ng and it 
does one bad thing," Klass said. 
"It how people that it is possible 
to go to chool even if you have to 
worle or if your parents cannot 
contribute much, but 1 don't think 
it accounts for all the little things 

t~at" can go wrong with financial 
ald. 

Klass aid he acknowledges the 
reality that many students have to 
work to be able to afford a UC 
education and as such, appreciates 
the Web page as another possible

resource. However, Klass also said 
he felt that, in the context of 
recent and future fee increases, 
the creation of this Web page is 
not divorced from the ulliversity's 
financial crisis. 

"This Web site seems to say 
that anybody who wants ro go to a 
University of California will be 
able to afford it," Klass said. "And 
that's just not true." 

Kimberly Eurich, Employer 
Outreach Specialist for Crawford 
High chool of an Diego, agrees 
with Klass. According to Eurich, 
even with the available financial 
tools, most students at Crawford 
could not afford a UC education 
without considerable financial 
help. 

"Our students would have a 
hard time even in a work-study 
Situation, and loans would be a 
daunting hurdle," Eurich said . 
"Many of our students are on their 
own, possibly hving with a couSin 
or fnend, and don't have access to 
parents, their tax forlllS, or under-
standing of how to apply for 

financial assistance." 
Eurich said that while personal 

stories of successful students are 
valuable, most of the students at 
Crawford do not have enough 
motivation or family support in 
seeking out resources. 

Mission Bay Iligh School 
Head Counselor Gretchen 
Rhoads found the Web site useful. 

"I think students, especially 
juniors, could use these profiles 
when they are planning for col-
lege," Rhoads said . "It gives 
them a picture of typical students 
at the University of California 
that have similar backgrounds. 
They can use it as a motivation, a 
'see, if they can, I can' -type of 
thing." 

According to Rhoads, most 
Mission Bay High chool Stu-
dents, with proper plannmg, can 
afford a University of California. 

"It's not easy to afford , but it is 
manageable with planning," 
Rhoads said.

and enrollment practices as well as 
for assessments of the effect.iveness 
of outreach programs. Data is also 
used to evaluate faculty and staff 
employment and contracting poli-
cies in order to conform to federal 
and state regulations. 

Pursuant to Proposition 209, 
the regents' Standing Policy 1 and 
RE-28 policies already ensure that 
race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity 
or national origin are not used as 
criteria in the UC admissions 
process. 

The decision to oppose the 
measure was also recommended by 
UC President Richard C. AtKinson 

and the UC Academic Senate. 
Regents John Davies and Peter 

Preuss joined Connerly in voting 
against the stance . Chair John 
Moores, who hosted a fund -raiser 
for Connerly seeking support for 
the initiative, abstained. 

The vore by the Regents ro 
oppose the measure is a rare act -
with similar stances having occurred 
only nine times prior over the past 
25 years - for measures other than 
education facilities bond acts. 

UC students from across the 
state came to San Francisco to 
voice their opposition to CREC-
NO during the May 14 and 15 
Regents meeting.

candidates need to 

tread carefully 
On May 21, the 2003 -04 A.S. Council got 

a bit larger when po ition left open after 
the rudents Fir t~ slate's mass dj qualifica-
tion in April were filled by appointment. 

orne positions have already been filled 
while the rest should be confirmed by the 
A .. senate by May 23. 

In fact, many of the appointees are former 
members of Students First!, including 
appointed vice president external Harish 
Nandagopal (pending an open roll call vote 
on May 23) and new commissioner of com-
munications Frances Galvon. Former 
Students First! candidate tephanie Aguon 
was appointed the commis ioner of diversity 
affair last week. 

Once the e open positions are filled, the 
council can get down to the bu ine s of 
serving the student body, and this is 
unquestionably good. It i also clear that 
these candidate are capable, qualified and 
pa ionate about campu i sue being 
increaSingly addre sed by a government run 
by and for the srudent , which can only 
benefit UC D. Overall, their appointments 
will bring positi\'e attributes to A.s. 
Council. 

However, the/ast cannot easily be for-
gotten . Aroun all the members of 
Students First! lingers the after-effects of 
this year's contentious election. Though it 
is impossible to know which members of 
the sla te or the slate's hangers-on were 
directly responsible for the disqualification 
and the deceit that followed, it is clear that 
none of them is without blame. They were 
disqualified for defying a legitimate and 
fair ruling of the elections committee, and 
their reaction to this disqualification was 
bitter. \Vhil e thiS could be written off as 
extreme action under extreme circum-
stances, one hopes they will leave behind 
whatever disrespect they may have ha r:-
bored for the rule~ governing A.S. 
CouncIl.

THURSDAY. MAY Z2. 2003 THE U D GUARDIAN OPINION S 

Focus on file--sharing presents problems, hypocrisy 
Regulation of student computer usage overly oppressive 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

File-sharing networks have had an illustrious legacy al UCSD: The campus was one 
of the first universities to delegit-
imize Napster; and students there-
after utilizi ng Gnutella, Kazaa or 
Morpheus for their mUSIC procure-
menl needs found their access to 
such networks blocked intermit-
tently over the past three year. 

Initially, Residential ctwork 
made the argument that regardless 
of the legal status of the files stu-
dents were trading, the fi le-sharing 
nerworks were hopelessly snarl ing 
residentia l Internet connections. 
Back in the days of Napster, much 
of the Internet infrastructure in the 
dorms consisted of first-generation 
cable modems running on existing 
coaxial Unes, which made for jams 
worse than 1-5 after a crane rrUshap 
(well, maybe not that bad). 

That was back when the Record 
Industry Association of America 
was suing Napsler, not college stu-
dents, in its effortS to stop the 
online orgy of musIc trading. 1\vo 
week ago, however, the RIM sued 
four college students for thousands 
of dollars for every so ng they 
~hared ; they ended up settling to 
pay omcwhere berween 10,000 
and 20,000 for their copyright 
mfrlngement. Thl, came on the 
heels uf two IInportant court deCI -
sIOns: The first reqUired that an 
Internet service prOVider divulge 
the idcnoty of a user thar had been 
shanng files. The sccond wa a 
deciSion holding that pure pecr- to-
peer nerworks without central file 
lists likc Morpheus were not liable 
for the act:lons of the users of their 
programs. 

Regardless of how evil college 
students make the RIAA out to be, 
under these circumstances, they 
have only onc logical course of 
action: Go after the individual user 
of the networks. And college stu-
dents turn out to be prctty ripe tar-
gets. Unlike home users of D L or 
cable modems, they are not well-
connected adults or lawyers willing 
to fight. Furthermore, the Internet 
addresses of college computers 
remain largely static, so If the RlAA 
went after a certum address, It 
could rcmall1 largely assured that 
the Infringer was snll there. 

And \0 It I11lghl not bc ~urpns­
mg that the past fcw weeks have 
witnc~sed ResNct threatcnmg to 

~hul tlm,n \tutlCI1I Internct con-
necllons after recclvlIlg e- l11aib 
from lhe RlA/\ detailing the files 
shared from speCific computers on 
the UCSD network. The RlAA c-
nwb detail fir\t the current ~t.ItUS

agcntS of a corporate entlly, lout on 

the other, failure to comply opens 
the University of California up to a 
legal battle it no doubt doesn't want 
at this time. As easy as it is to curse 
ResNet openly every time they 
block file sharing software or go 
after students, however, one has to 
remember that by complying with 
the RIMs demands, the university 
is in effeCt making students anony-
mous and protecting them from 
further lega l action. 

A historical analogy may be in 
order here: Back in the late '60s, 
when protest was convulsmg most 
of the UC campuses, the UC 
Regents and UCSD Chancellor 
William McGill were largely demo-
nized by protesters and the student 
body a part of a racist system that 
insisted on the teaching of conserv-
ative propaganda and the oppression 
of student activism. In Chancellor 
McGi ll \; book, "The Year of the 
Monkey," he strongly asserts that 
his aims and the aims of the UC 
Regents were to act as moderating 
forces to protect students and acad-
emics on the campuses from a state 
hostile to their current existence. 

alifornia under Gov. Ronald 

Reagan, and San Diego in particu-
lar, were much more con ervative 
and more than willing to affect dras-
tic change on the universi ties to root 
our "communism." Sntdents were 
railing against the very system lhat 
was protecting them from the out-
Side world. 

" This is, after all, a 
law with enforcement 

precedent that stiU 
borders on the hazy to 

• 1/ 
non-eXIStent. 

This does not, however, excuse 
the actions of the Regents when 
they censured Chancellor McGill 
for defending the noted philoso-
pher Herbert Marcuse, by then a 
professor at UCSD who was pub-
licly regarded by Reagan as a sym-
bol of evil communi Ill. And like-
wise, it does not excu e Res et 

from the fact that by consenting to 
be the RlAA's agent, they are effec-
tively setting a precedent for the 
external monitoring and enforce-
ment of UCSD nerwork traffic. 

While they are theoretically 
constrained by law to shut down 
copyright violations on the net-
work, UCSD could use "service 
provider" clauses of current law to 
state that they are a neutral com-
municator not responsible for 
transient material on their net-
work and refuse to divulge student 
information. ThiS is, after all, a 
law with enforcement precedent 
that still borders on the hazy to 
nonexistent when it comes to actu-
al liability, no doubt because no 
large entity with the appropriate 
legal resources has yet to pick a 
fight with the RIM. 

This may all seem rather silly and 
pointless. After aU, the students were 
caught rather openly sharing illegiti-
mate files, and the university is pret-
ty much obliged to take care of it or 
let the students pick their own fight 
with the RIAA But the time will 
come - mark this writer's words -
where the only way to stop file shar-

mg wll1 be for the university to watch 
the exaCl content of IIlformation 
going through the nerwork. 

Already, there are programs like 
"Freenet" that make It ImpoSSible 
for anyone to tell who IS stonng 
what, because user~ allocate J por-
oon of their hard dnves to automat-
ed encrypted nerwork storage that 
only has parts of files on It. Thus, the 
users of the nerwork have no idea 
what they are shanng. The only wa, 
for the RIM to tell whether or not 
snldents are mfringmg copYright 
would be to pry open their comput-
ers or get somebody who can mom-
tor SUSpICIOUS traffic - namely, 
Res et. 

And If an acadenuc institution 
that operates on the principle of free 
trade in information chooses to 
enforce corporate interests rather 
than protect the privacy of its own 
students, that will be quite a shame. 

This column stands for egalitarian 
principles. As a result, all correspon·

Watts drops appeal of disqualification 
Alexander will now take over as WCSC pres. 

By CiA~LLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

Warren 'ollege Student 
Council Presidem-elect Daniel 
Wa tts surrendered his case a frer 
being twice disqualified from his 
position, announcing his decision 
at the start ofhis May 19 hearing 
of the WCSC judicial board. The 
board continued the hearing, 
finding Watts guilty of violating 
elections bylaws and disqualifying 
him from the elections by a 4-0-0 
vote. 

Tim Alexander, who had gar-
nered the second-highest number 
of votes during the WCSC elec-
tions, will now be taking the po i-
tion of WC C president. Had the 
board ruled in favor of Watts, 
WC C Vice President Internal 
Jessica Kepford would have 
assumed the duties of WCS pres-
idem once Watts resigned. 

Watts resigned his case due to a 
conflict of interest having arose 
earlier on the day of May 19, when 
he was elected to the posItion of 
opinion co-editor of Tbt UCSD 
Gun/-dian for the 2003-04 academic 
year. 

"I think he did what was in his 
best interest and did what he felt 
was right. But in terms of the hear-
ing, it didn 't really affect us," said 
WCSC former president Donald 
Povieng, who announced that his 
term ended with the May 20 
announcement of the board's deci-
sion. "We still needed to figure out 

if he had violated those bylaws." 
Plaintiff rystal Kitamura had 

filed a grievance against Watts on 
April II, claiming that Watts had 
been in violation of bylaws, staong 
that candidates may not use 
"Warren College office , services, 
enterprises or equipment including 
computers, paints, stationary 
and/or logo." 

Watts left midway through the 
hearing after announcing his 
withdrawal from the case and the 
elections process as a whole. 
Watt claimed that he could have 
won the case based on several 
grounds, including that board 
members, who had renewed their 
term until Watts' case was decid-
ed, were not allowed to do so, and 
claimed that he had, in effect, 
been president ince ixth week of 
spring quarter, making the current 
judicial board hearing illegal. 
However, Watts presented no evi-
dence and brought no witnesses a 
he wem on to announce his resIg-
nation. 

"I don't thmk he gave the plam-
tiff the proper respect he should 
have," POVleng said. "We only got 
the facts from one side. In some 
sen e, this made our deCision easi-
er." 

Kitamura argued that Watts had 
broken the bylaw in question by 
using computers in the Warren 
College Television srudio, and that 
WCTV was a part of Earl Warren 
College. After Watts' departure, 
board member Kirsten Bowen 

questioned both KItamura and LIsa 
Root, Warren College assistant res-
Idential dean and witness for 
Kitamura, askmg them whether 
computers were u ed In the pro-
duction of Watts' show. Both 
answered in the affirmative. Bowen 
expressed regret that Watts was not 
present to answer the question . 

According to both Watts and 
WCTV intern Scott Jennings, 
there are two computers in the 
werv srudio but neither are used 
for the production of "Perfect 
Vision." Watts' show uses a 
Videonics video character genera-
tor, which is used to title the bve 
call-in show and posr the srudio's 
phone number. 

Alexander, who did not particI-
pate or attend the hearing regard-
ing Watts' case, saId he fclt WCSC 
had done its best to handle the case. 

"It seemed that everybody was 
making their be t efforts by putting 
in time and energy to hold a fair 
trial and make a fair deCISion," 
Alexander said. 

Alexander's goals for preSIdency 
mclude Implementing the newly 
drafted Warren College constlru-
tion by having students vote on 
passing it in a speCIal election to be 
held fall quarter 2003, at which 
time he also plans to propose a ref-
erendum that would bring more 
money into WCSC in order to 
aVOId budget problems faced by the 
former council.

Autonomy: Outline for move looked into 
continued [Tam page I 

of implementation, potential 
effects on the student population 
and the amount of student sup-
port for autonomy. 

The task force would also 
study potential alternate ources 
of income for socia ted Student 
and the impact autonomy would 
have on student life and relations 
with the administration . Upon the 
completion of research, the task 
force i to "recommend the desir-
ability of autonomy." The rask 
force's recommendation would be 
submitted no later than the first 
week of Spring 2004. 

"We want to do the back-
ground research, to talk with the 
adminIstration, to look at all rhe 
posi tives and negatives - all 
things which, for the most part, 
have nOl been done yet," 
I Iarrington said. "There's never 
been any debate regarding the 
underlying question: Is A.S . 
autonomy a good goal to have?" 

Autonomy could entail A .. 
control of its own fund-raising, 
the A.S. Council's independence 
from the jurisdiction of the Vice 
Chancellor of tud<:J1I AffaIrs and 
IIlcreased student rcpr senratJon 
on all-campus committees 
charged with managing ~tudent 
fee-funded venture, 
Iko ipentarhos said. llowever, 
there is no single definition of 
autonomy, and the task force 

would explore many potential 
aspects of autonomy, according to 
Harrington. 

"There are different levels of 
autonomy," Harrington said . 
"Autonomy is not one thing. It 
can mean several things." 

The question of A. . autonomy 
and student control and represen-
tation on all-campus committees 
ha been debated recently III the 
wake of the Price Center and 
Student Center ExpanSIOn 

" There' never been any question regarding the 
underlying question: Is 
A.S. auwnomyagood 

goal to have?" 
- Max Harrington. ERe 

sophomore senator 

Refcrendum, which was recently 
approved by students. Although 
student control of the Price 
Center and Student Center i not 
currently deSignated as an issue 
for the task force to address, It is 
IIlterrelated with A.'. autonomy 
and "could be a beneficial part of 
autonomy," Harrington said. 

The charter for the task force 
may be amended next week to 
address thIS issue specifically, 
Harrington said . 

"If A.S. become more inde-
pendcnt, would It translate into 
more [srudent] influence over Unl-
verslry deciSIOns or less?" 
Harrington saId, addIng that stu-
dents have limIted repre entation 
III such all-campus comlllittees as 
the TransportatlOll Policy 
Comnllttee and the 
Campus/CommuJ1lty PlannJ!1g 
Committee. 

According to the proposed 
charter, the task force would be 
composed of 17 voting members, 
with a represent<1tJ"e pre ent from 
each college, the A. . Councd and 
the Unlver ity enter Ad"lsory 
Board and up to three representa-
tJves from the Graduate tudent 
ASSOCIation. The .S. comml -

(or any distributor) , 
Jumpstarting their

discussed thei r feelings 
about their films, what

they both gave some heart-

a chilltng murder with a mysterious

around the same lime) The Inge-

dl~cusses how struggltng filmmak-
ers rrally do thlllgs' 

Guardian ' So was U oft for 
Dlggmg" your first film' 

).T. Petty: Yeah. I was 20 when 

we shot it. 

G: So it has been a six-year 
process to get your film shown? 

JTP: Yes. It was done on video in 
late 2001. It took a couplc of years to 
make 3 prim bccause II was always 
just my own money. It was fairly 
cheap to finish it on video, but then a 
long time coming to actually have 
something to project. 

G, 0 how did you finance the 
film? 

JTP: We shot It for $6,000, 0 I 
baSically lived off of nothll1g for my 
last twO years of college. I moved 
mto an apartment that I could touch 
all of the walls of, but It wa 14 feet 
tall, so I bwlt the entire thing lateral -
ly. And I ate rice and beans for two 
years. The money I had put aside for 
Itv1l1g expenses in college became 
"Soft for Digging." 

G: After you shot it, were you try-
ing to get people to invest in it' 

JTP: We kind of did , We want-
ed people to invest before we shot 
it. That's sti ll the part of the process 
of making a film that is sti ll the 
strangest to me , ince then, people 
have given me money to make a 
movie, and I thi nk that is ridicu-
lous. It doe n't make sen;e. 

So we sent letters to luminaries, 
like random filmmakers that we 
liked and asked them to give us 
money in exchange for things -
Itke we had a scale system, like for 
$500 you would get a T-shirt, for 
$2,000 you would get a walk-on 
dressed as Alfred Hitchcock in the 
film. I think we did that mostly to 
amuse ourselves because we didn't 
get any investors. After I made the 
print, that was an additIOnal $4,000, 
so I had spent $10,000 of my own 
money at that time and then it 
played Sundance, And the fact that 
it was a movie that cost $6,000 
became my calli ng card. So it 
became a point of pride nOt to have 
anybody else invest m it. So I could

Built to Spill's new rock sound 
overflows into The Scene 

Boise, Idaho natives Built to Spill to play with Draw and 
Solace Brothers for an evening of indie rock 
By CLAYTON WORFOLK 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

The Pacific Northwest has long bcen a breeding ground for new rock - and not the kind of "new rock" you hear on 
the radio. In the 19805, the Screaming Trees, 
Beat Happening and Wipers helped define 
the budding alternative rock ound along the 
upper Pacific coast, And in the 19905, Seattle 
gave birth to grunge, arguably one of the 
most significant influences on both under-
ground and mainstream rock today. 

T he great orthwest is making waves again 
the e days, chi time in the world of indie rock. 
The region's more recent offerings have 
included Modest Mouse and Slcater-KirUley. 
I Iowcver, the latest musical contributions from 
the Northwest are typified by none bettcr than 
Boise, Idahos Built to pill , who bring their 
expansive sounds to The Scene on May 22. 

Blending spacey alt-rock experimenta-
tion and decelerated grunge-rank distor-
tion, Built to Spill is very much a product of 
their unique musical environment. For over 
a decade now, the group has been the brain 
child of indie scene icon Doug >!artsch, 
who c high-pitched vocals and sprawling 
guitar lines almost si ngle-handedly define 
the Built ound. Ethereal at times, poppy at 
others and off-beat all-around, Built to Spill 
borrows from an array of influcnces, both 
native to the band and distant. 

" 

Courtey of http://Www.slp.uh.edJ 
Lov.1y noise: BUilt to Spill shares melodic and 
InfectiOUS musIC that WIll leave audiences thrilled. 

1993 for ea ttle indie label ClZ Records, 
Album highlights include" owhere othin' 
Fuckup," a take on the Velvet Underground's 
"Oh! Sweet Nothin'," and the simplistic and 
raw "Lie for a Lie." 

A year later, Built released the much more 
focused and melodic Tberc's Notbing Wrong 
Wirh Love on Up Records, T he album fea-

Mansch's alto and hiS 
penchant for thc endless 
overdriven guitar 010 is 
trademark eil Young, 
while his quirky lyrics and 
abstract pop hooks hint at 
the Velvet Underground 
(from whom he occasionally 
quotes). Add into the mix 
layered, effects-heavy "wall 
of sound" production, alr-
rock-esque tempo changes 
and some emo-worthy pin -
ing and you've gOt the amal-
ga m that is BUilt to pill. 

There's no mistaking 
that Built to Spill is 

still The Doug 
Martsch Show. Not 

that this is a bad 

tured tighter guitar interplay 
and found instant indie clas-
sics in the heartfelt "Twin 
Fa lls," "Car" and the free-
wheeling "Distopian Dream 
Girl." 

In 1997, the band signed 
with "Varner Bros. Records 
and released Perftcr From Now 
On, an abnormally radio-
unfriendly major label debut 
(only one ong is under five 
minutes in length), Built fol-
lowed the release in 1999 with 
Kup Ir Like A reret, a collec-

thing. " 
What makes Built to 

Spill all the more intrigu-
ing is the band's acknowledgement of ItS 
range of mUSical roots and influences, On 
"You Were Right," the most smklngly pow-
crful track on Built's 1999 Krrp It l.lkr A 
Stcrtt release, Mansch rattles off lyriCS 
penned by some of rock' grea test songwrII -
ers ("You were right when you said we're all 
JUSt bricks in the walll and when you said 
manic depression's a frustrating mess"). 
Furthermore, the band's live set is typically 
ripe with covers, including everything from 
The Clash to George Harrison to Lynyrd 
Skynyrd to The Smiths. 

Martsch formed Built to Spill with fellow 
indie cenesters Brett Netson (Caustic Resin) 
and Ralf Youtz (later of the Feelings and the 
No- os) after leaving orthwest alt-rockers 
Treepeople in 1992 . Rhythm sections have 
come and gone in yeus si nce, making 
Martsch Built to Spill's only regular member. 
And although bassist Brett Nelson (not to be 
confused with Netson) and drummer SCOlt 
Plouf have been core band members for over 
five years now, there's no mistaking that Built 
to Spill is still the Doug Mansch show. ot 
that this is a bad thing. 

Martsch wa ted no time after forming 
Built , recording the ~Ioppy and lo-fi (yet 
I11fecuous) Ulmnlltr Illtrntarlvt ~VtJVtrs in 

tion of catchier and more con-
cise alt-rock songs that actual-

ly won the band a temporary spot on the 
Billboard 200. 

Built to • pill released a Itve album In 
2000 (which, It mllst be noted, features a ~o­
mlnutc cover of eli Young's "Cortez the 
Killcr") and, most recently, AUClmr ,\tIt/Ot/lff 
of rbe PI/rw'c, m 200 I. Anowr Aldodres is 
perhaps the band's 1lI0st expansive effort to 
date, featuring not only the band's fanliitar 
arena -ready sound-scapc (" trangc," 
"Alarmed"), but also rootsy blueslfolk 
(" Happi ness") and acoustics ("The 
Weather"). 

The departures come as no surprise, 
however, as Martsch ha never been hesitant 
to branch out. Mart ch formed the ide-
project Halo Benders with Beat 
Happcning's baritone vocalist alvin 
Johnson in 1994, and the duo has recorded 
three albums - much in the same indie 
rock vein as Built to Spill - since. In addi-
tion, Martsch released the roots rocking 

ow YOII Know, his first 010 end eavor, in 
2002 to much critical acclaim. 

Joining Built to pill on May 22 Jt T he 
Scene will be Idaho indie-emo hybrid Draw 
and Tucson, Ariz.'s eclecuc olace Brotl1ers, 
TickclS for the 7:30 p.m. show are ~ull avail-
a ble for 15 at Tickenna ter outlets.

10 HIATUS THE U D GUARDIAN 

Nol an 'Almigbty' return to comedy 
Jim (arrey is granted heavenly powers in this not-so-heavenly fi lm 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

Jim Carrey's long awaited return to comedy IS here Carrey shows up In hiS tradi-
tional face-tWisting fashi on In 
"Bruce Almighty" as an egomani-
ac who is given celestial power 
after repeatedly criticizing the 
work of the heavenly father 
(Morgan Freeman). 

While Carrey bring a pres-
ence to the screen that is all hi 
own, hiS performance lacks the 
zeal that he brought during his 
earher days. \\lllIle a portion of 
thi problem can be chalked up to 
playmg Increasmgly mature roles, 
there I definitely the feel that 
Carrey IS not his old sel f on 
creen. His career transitions are 

under tandably dlfficult to naVI-
gate. He has gone from strictly 
slapstick to dead senous, and 
"Bruce AllTllghty" finds him In a 
lukewarm romantic comed,. 

\\ nile no one Will de~y that 
the enore premise IS Intended to 
be a velucle for Carrey's comedy. 
"Bruce AJlTllghty" takes a while to 
get Its engine gomg. The first half 
hour I full of spaso and often-
times uncomfortable monologues. 
The film also pretends to have a 
message, detracting from its much 
clearer purpose of getting Jim 
Carrey into otherwise unimagin-
able si tuations. 

The side performances in 
"Bruce Almighty" are limited and 
relatively mundane. Jennifer 
Aniston, who plays his girlfriend, 
brings a feel of "same old romantic 
comedy" to a film that might have 

counesy of Unive!sal Pictures 
Holy moly: Jim Carrey gets supernatural powers and Jennifer Amston IS hiS 
unsuspecting g,rlfnend surpnsed by them In the new comedy "Bruce Almighty.· 

been bener off \\,thout that burden 
ro carry. It takes a special Ic.ind of 
scnpt ro allow Carrey to show off 
his geruus and at the same ome 
carry another purpose. "Man on 
the Moon" did It WIth Carrey as a 
lead and "The Cable Guy" did it 
with him as a co-star. "Bruce 
Almighty" doesn't really do it at all. 

That being said, "Bruce 
Almighty" does offer moments of 
hilarious comedy that will be 
required viewing for Jim Carrey 
junkies. This film does not have 
the replay value thaI the avefage 
Carrey comedy does, but will 

IIlspire plenty of laughs the fim 
time around. As fa r as romantic 
comedies go, "Bruce Alnl1ghty" is 
ITllddle of the pack. 

Ultimately, "Bruce Almighty" 
is another entertaini ng misstep in 
Jlln Carrey's ca reer. Mo t viewers 
will enjoy it, but nOt remember it. 
Carrey's fan base is going to ensure 
the film's success; they will do it 
half-smiling. Carrey's genius goes 
to waste in "Bruce Almighty."

Rated PG-13 

'Manic' a stunning display of talent 
Strong acting and good timing make up for depressing storyline 

By CLINTON HAYCRA" 
Staff Writer 

"M anlc" IS a disturbing 
drama about 17 -year-old 
Lyle (Jo~eph Gordon-

Levm) who finds himself In an 
institution with other troubled 
youths after beaong one of Ius 
peers cI 0 e to dea th WI th a ba~e­
ball bat. 

-nu film IS enough to put one 
In a post-marua depressive state, 
even If one doe n't suffer from clin-
ICal maruc-depresslon. It IS stark 
and dlZZ}'lng (and not "dJzzYlllg" In 
some figurative sense). Tlus IS ob\1-
owly done to convey the unstable 
states of the characters in each shot, 
but it IS an unnecessary and nause-
ating aesthetic. Do not take a date 
to dus feature, unless of course, 
both of your ideas of a good time 
include abusive behaVIOr, toppling 
funuture, self-muclaoon and slck-
erung camera tricks. 

Lyle's character IS verball y 
reserved and expresses himself WIth 
little else than VIolence. He Imme-
diately butts heads WIth the bully 
Michael (Elden Ilenson) and bud-
rues up With Chad (Michael Bacall), 
seerrungly the truest bipolar mamc-
depres Ive In the film. 

The stOIC gJrls of the group, 
goth-gJrl an (Sara Rlvas) and vio-
lent-nightmare-sufferer Tracey 
(Zooey Dechanel), often watch the 
males act out 111 the recurring 
group therapy circle, faCilitated by 
Dr. Monroe (Don Cheadle), who 
seems to uffer from either add I -
oon or marnc depres Ion hnnself. 
The result of dus equaoon IS a very 
volatile group of characters bound 
for Inevi ta ble VIolent conflict and 
repeated dl.saster. 

"Man! "does, however, addre s

noncommittal (so to speak) fash-
Ion. Any young member of the 
audience Will be able to Idenofy 
With at least one of the characters. 
The cha racters, as well as the cer-
tam aspects of popular culture that 
they address (i.e., raves, Rage 
Against the Machine, Play tatlon, 
etc.) are geared toward an 
estranged, Instlruoonahzed med-
Icated generation. The lesson to be 
learned, accordlllg to Dr. Monroe, 
IS that, "wherever you're gomg, 
you're still gonna be there." 

'me tronge t pomt of dus iiI m 
IS the acting jobs of some of the 
young actors, particularly Gordon-
LeVItt as Lyle. One would never 
beheve that tim IS the Iud from 
"Third Rock from the Sun." as he 
exermes Iu power to Identify WIth 
the aurucnce one moment, then

Henson portrays Lyle's nemesi , 

Mlchad, in such a way that he is the 
mOSt despicable, and thus, the most 
memorable of all. Michael attempts 
to dlsgwse hJS msecurity WIth the 
bravado of black stereotypes, 
although he I as wlute aJ. can be. 
Bacall also gIVes a profound perfor-
mance as Chad. 

Although thiS film IS shot in 
such a way as to nauseate and 
spell Out the obvious, Its en~e of 
tlmmg IS stunning and the ongi-
nal soundtrack IS ;ublllne. But be 
ready - It's a rough one, a down-

the distance because of that. 

T here were a lot of funny 
things, 'cause in the nature of 
indiellow budget filmmaking, at a 
certain point you'll do anything to 
get the film done. We had rented 
an apartment building, a tene-
ment, in Koreatown, which is a 
neighborhood in LA The land-
lord was like "Oh yeah, go ahead, 
take over the whole building, we're 
just renovating it." 

Then, midway through shoot-
ing, we discovered that he was 
starting to rent out apartments as 
we were shooting, and he was 
threatening to close us down. a to 
keep on his good si de we started to 
show prospective tenants around 
betwecn takes. So I would yell, 
"Cut'" then I'd run out to see if 
there was anybody outside with an 
application and then I'd go up, 
show them the apartment, I'd take 
their application, I'd go back down 

and we'd do another shot. When 
you're making an independent film 
you kind of have to make things 
work and get it done. 

G : 0 there's a lot of kissing up? 

MT: It feel s less like kissing up 
and more like wading through the 
mud with the troOps. 

G : So do you have any advice or 
words of wisdom for aspiring film-
makers? 

MT: CreJte good alliances 
with your friends. Find good peo-
ple to work with starting out. They 
are very important. ot only in 
terms of bUSiness but in terms of 
forming creative relationships like 
a composer you like to work with 
or an actor you like to work with . 
If you find these people starting at 
the ground level, then you develop 
together. And get good sound.

Back before I was even getting my feet wet with the music cene, my cousin introduced 
me to "Weird Al" Yankovic. ot 
exactly a pivotal moment in devel-

but nevertheless I began to appre-
ciate his comical renditions as he 
began to establish his ca reer with 
the hclp of ridiculous videos on

r have to admit that r listened 

he 's not actually a rock star. So he 
has no excuses other then clinging 
to fame, and no one telling him to 
wait on releasing work until he's 
gOt enough quality material. 

Then again, looking back on 
most of hi recent albums, there 
was little worth remembering. It's 
just that everything has become 
formulaic, and the same as what 
has been done before. "Weird AI " 
ought to do us all a favor and find 
something else to do other than 
releasing mediocre albums until 
no one buys them anymore . Save

Then, the hiatus office 

received an advanced copy of 
Poodlt fiaT, AI's first album in over 
four years. I was intrigued; the 
cover sticker billed parodies of

the Backstreet Boys. These are 
groups that could use a littlc com-

12 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. MAY 22. 2003 

Geeks rejoice in a gamer's paradise Digging: Director still feels like a pretender in movies 
E3 combines disproportionate females and the newest video games 

continued from page 8 days, no money and then you 
know three years later co find 
yourself at Sundance. I still feel 
like, "I'm ju t barely fooling 
everybody, and they're going co 
realize that I'm JUSt pretending." 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff writer 

E 3, or the Electronic Entertainment Expo, i heav-en on earth for Vldeo game 
nerd the world rO\Uld. After all, 
what more could you ask for than a 
chance to play th~ newest, hottest, 
unreleased games, have your pic-
ture taken with unattainable, attrac-
tive, scantily clad models and see 
Lance Bass from *NSYNC all in 
one place? 

The heart of E3 is really the 
games, and this year there was no 
shortage of jaw-dropping titles. 
Being a member of the media, I was 
granted access to attend Microsoft's 
pre-E3 press event, where they 
debuted the first-ever playable 
footage of "Halo 2," eliciting a 
response said best by Neo in "The 
Matrix" : "Whoa." By now the 
"Halo 2" video should be on your 
favorite gaming news Web site, so 
Stop whatever you're doing right 
now and download it. From dual-
wielding assault rifles to hijaclcing 
enemy vehicles, "Halo 2" will have 
something for everyone, and when 
you factor in Xbox Live' support, 
who really needs the models? 

peaking of the models, the 
most enjoyable show of models 
came from Tecmo Inc., creators of 
"Dead or Alive 3," a popular fight-
ing game and "Dead or Alive 

Xtreme Beach Volleyball." Their 
booth was home to what they 
termed 3 "live-action fashion 
show," which consi ted first of the 
models appearing in their "DOA 3" 
fighting costumes and performing 
some cursory kung fu action. ext 
the ladies returned in their DOA 
volleyball outfits (red bikinis) and 
threw out volleyballs complete with 
lipstick kisses to the crowd. While 
the plot was a little shallow, the 
graphics were highly realistic, earn-
ing the DOA Live Fashion Show a 
perfect 10. 

Back to the games though. 
Other titles that looked to have 
high potential included all of 
Blizzard's offerings: "Starcraft 
Ghost," "World of Warcraft" and 
"Warcraft III: The Frozen 
Throne." Nintendo had a very 
large booth pushing its newest 
games, of which "Mario Kart 
Double Dash" for the GameCube 
looked most promising. Sony's 
booth was a little subdued, but they 
had a strong lineup of games from 
the Final Fantasy universe on dis-
play, including "Final Fantasy X-2," 
"Final Fantasy XI" and "Final 
Fantasy Tactics Advanced." In addi-
tion, Sony announced they will be 
producing a new handheld to com-
pete with the Game Boy, but it 
won't be available until next year.

event, which featured a few snip-
pets of in-game footage, but the 
overall demo was disappointingly 
short for a game with so much 
hype and a release date only six 
months away. EA was showing off 
all its newest sports titles from 
NFL to NBA to MLB, as well as a 
couple of games featuring college 
sports and some more obscure 
sports like rugby. 

One of the more suspect titles at 
the show was a new version of Pac-
Man from Nintendo that allows 
four people to split roles between 
being Pac-Man and the ghosts; this 
game would have been revolution-
ary in 1985, but what exactly is 
Nintendo thinking in 2003? 

In another surprising move, 
Microsoft unveiled their new Xbox 
Music Mixer, a product that comes 
with a microphone and software 
which allows your Xbox to function 
as a karaoke machine, store pictures 
and perform a few other digital 
media tasks. It seems that a very 
small minority of self-respecting 
hardcore garners are really think-
ing, "You know what I wish my 
Xbox could do? Let me sing 
karaoke!" The popularity of this 
product is very suspect. 

E3 was grea t, and there is a lot 
of exciting news for garners from

now aren't you) 

JTP: [ could be pretending at 
that too. It's a straight-co-video 
giant cockroach movie. Yeah. it's 
work and it's a monster movie 
which is great fun . 

G: Do you have any words of 
wisdom for aspiring filmmakers? 

JT: That's a common e-mail I 
get on my 'Soft for Digging" Web 
site. My advice could be e-mail 
me. I answer those. I guess the 
only answer I could give fo r that is 
self promotion is important. It ' 
lci nd of embarrassi ng, it is. 
Everybody I know from school 
who is actually making a living as 
a storyteller weren't the best sto-
rytellers. They were the people 
who finished their projects and 
took the time to present them to 
people. It's 0 easy to, after you've 
finished the first cut of a film, co 
feel satisfied with that, but no one 
wants to see that. It's all about 
talcing the time to polish and co 
tell people it' good before they've 
seen it .

Front Row: 
Sorenstam 

thinks she has 
a chance 
continued from page ,6 

stands to gain, I think he has a 
point and seriously calls into 
question what Sorenstam is doing 
a t the Colonial. 

My favorite question of all is 
how Sorenstam will play. Some 
think she has a chance to finish in 
the top 20. Mosr see her missing 
the cut by a small margin. Almost 
no one thinks she'll finish dead 
last, and there will most likely be at 
least a few poor souls left as the 
laughingstock of rheir peers. 
What's funnier than a professional 
gol fer who will go the rest of his 
life hearing about how he got beat 
by a girl' Sorenstam' statement 
that if everything goes right, she 
could win thi s tourn ament -
that's what. 

From my own per onal obser-
vations, in most sports, the top 
women in the world rank at about 
the level of an elite male high 
school student. Skeptical? 
Florence Griffith-Joyner holds the 
women's world record in the 100-
meter dash at 10.49 seconds. In the 
United States, six high school boy 
have run that fast this season alone. 
If you still don't buy it, ask yourself 
what WNBA team could've even 
been competitive with LeBron 
James and his boys. Now you're 
getting the picture. 

So Sorenstam is an exception, 
and golf is the perfect game for 
females to be competitive with 
men, but she's not that much of an 
exception. The Colonial is fairly 
short for PGA standards, but it's 
500 yards longer than any LPGA 
course Sorenstam ha played. 

That's a big difference. Instead 
of hitting high, soft, controlled 
shots into greens, she's going CO be 
hitting long irons that are going to 
skip and roll on the dry Texa 
grass. This is not going to be a 
walk in the park. 

Throw in the media, national 
attention and a much tougher 
course than shes used to, and I 
don't think Sorenstam is going co 
make the cut, much less compete. 
Is it good for golf? Is it fair? Will 
~he surprise us? Those arc ques-
tions you'll just have to tune in to 
to have answered .

ARE YOU 
OUITAHERE? 
If you're graduating this year, there may be a special and potentially 
embarrassing message for you in the 6/5 Grad Issue. We mailed a few 
thousand letters to parents of graduates asking if they'd like to buy a little 
ad hyping your big day, We asked for a cute photo as well. 

More than 100 parents and loved ones have reserved space in the 6/5 Grad Issue. Isn't it 
wonderful to have proud parents? And won't it be interesting to see which photo they sent us? 

PS: We're not sure if you 'll be able to view the grad ads via PDF at our web site

SENIOR SENDOFF 

Men's volleyball sends off four players 
Mortimer will play professionally in Europe 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men 's volleyball 
team will graduate four multi-year 
players thjs year who have made 
significant impacts on the future of 
the program. 

Four-year players Eric Perrine 
and Chris Mortimer, along with 
three-year player Brian F oott and 
two-year player James l{jmball have 
seen the transformation of UCSD 
from a team that was competitive 
only with much smaller schools, (0 
the current squad, which competes 
each night with the top Division I 
teams in the nation. 

Perrine, a management science 
major at Revelle College, will grad-
uate this spring. He spent his 
senior season at UCSD primarily at 
sener, but during the course of his 
time here, he has played significant 
amounts of time as outside hitter 
and middle blocker as well. Triton 
head coach Ron Larsen comment-
ed on how this helped two-time 
captain Perrine to be a leader. 

"Eric was the role model type 
of a captain," Larsen said. "Guys 
looked up (0 him because he 
could do everything on the 
court." 

Perrine's career totals expand 
on that point. He leaves UCSD 
with 1,322 assists, 516 kills, 386 
digs, 277 blocks and 65 service 
aces. Hjs plans for next year are 

not set yet, but he may be either 
finding a job or looking to play 
volleyball professionally in 
Europe. 

Perrine's co-captain this past 
season was Mortimer, who plays 
the Ijbero position and graduated 
last quarter from John Muir 
College with a communication 
degree. From the 2000 season, in 
which the Tritons won a Division 
III national championship, until 
now, Mortimer has been a defen-
sive stronghold who helped his 
team most with his knowledge of 
the game. 

"Chris was a quiet leader who 
really understood what it took to 
win and be competitive and prob-
ably had the best volleyball IQ of 
anybody on the team," Larsen 
said. 

Mortimer amassed 607 digs in 
his four years at UCSD, leading 
the team in both his junior and 
senior seasons. He will leave in 
early August to play professionally 
in Europe. 

Foott, a middle bloclcer from 
Eleanor Roosevelt College, will 
graduate in the spring with a degree 
in management science. He has been 
among the team leaders in bloclcs in 
each of his three seasons at UCSD, 
and has conmbuted to a program in 
which he sees a lot of growth from 
his sophomore year until now. 

"[Beforel, we very rarely com-
peted with the top teams. Now 

we're able to compete with almost 
every team," Foott said. 

Like Perrine and Mortimer, 
Larsen noted that Foot! showed 
the co-operative attributes that are 
essential to being part of a success-
ful team. 

"Brian is of the same mold," 
Larsen said. "He knows what it 
takes to be a team guy." 

F oott is still unsure as (0 his 
post-graduation plans. 

The fourth Triton senior is 
IGmball, an economics major at 
Thurgood Marshall College who 
played two years with the Tritons 
after transferring from BYU. 
Larsen noted that although his 
playing time was limited, IGmball's 
contributions in practice were a 
great help to the team. 

"J ames was good in practice and 
helped out a lot," Larsen said. "He 
made the people around him better 
because they were fighting for their 
starting spots." 

Kimball plans to attend law 
school after graduation. 

As individuals and as players, 
Perrine, Mortimer, Foott and 
IGmball have made a contribution 
to this campus, and to the future 
of UCSD volleyball. Their efforts

"Sports Dlustrated has rated us 
the 'Best Surf School in the 
Nation,' and Surfing Magazine has 
rated us both the 'Best Surf 
School,' and 'School with the Best 
Surfing Alumni,'" said co-captain 
Aaron Napier. 

Such accolades help UCSD 
draw some of the beSt surfers in the 
country. Some of the alumni that 
make up the great UCSD surfing 
teams of the past include Rusty 
Presiendorfer, owner of the Rusty 
brand of clothing and surfboards, 

Evan Slater, editor of Surfing 
Magazine, and professional surfers 
Brian and Kent Doonan, Sean 
Hayes, Allen Johnson and Holly 
Beck. 

The surf team practices almo t 
exclusively at Blacks Beach, across 
the street from campus, and even 
hosts a tournament there during 
the year, making UC D the only 
team to host a tournament at its 
own beach.

surf team here and its tradition. 
They reaUy want to be a part of it,"

apier said. "We have the key to 
Blacks, which means we can drive 
down to it, while everyone else ha 
to walk." 

"Every year when we hold the 
contest at Blacks, all the schools get 
to see how lucky and fortunate the 
UCSD surf team really is," apier 
said. 

ocing the prominence the surf 
team has in the surf community 
and its storied history, many com-
panies jump at the opportunity to 
sponsor them. 

"Our sponsors have been crucial 
to our success this year, and we 
want to thank them all," Edwards 
aid. 

The surf team recruits most of 
its members through tryout, 
which they hold during the fir t 
three weeks of the new school year. 

"A lot of people don't even 
know how to join the team - I ju t 
happened to ~tumble across a flyer 
myself," Edwards aid. "We'd like 
evetyone to come out to tryOutS 
next year though. We had a big 
success thiS year thanks to our 
sponsor , and we hope to have an 
even grea ter one next year. It' a 
day of free food , prize and just a 
lot of fun ." 

Beyond practicing and holding 
official tournaments, the surf team 
holds events su h as movie screen-
Ings in the Price enter, and alter-
native-style contests, which are 
surfing COntests open to the gener-
al public and urfers of all kill Icv-

Bryce Warwick 

F or tho e of you who cringe when I wnte about the intersection of sports and 
gender: Brace your elf. 

ThiS weekend, Annaka 
orenstam will head to Fon 

\Vorth, Texas, to pia), 10 thc 
Colomal, and 10 domg so, she Will 
become the fir t woman to COIll-
pete In a Profe slonal Golfers 
AsSOCiation event In 5 years. Her 
arrival has brought on a lew of 
discu Ion and a pile of unan-
swered questions. 

The first of these questions is 
whether or not Annika belongs. 
Vijay Singh, the fourth-ranked 
player in the world, came out and 
said unequivocally that he thinks 
she doesn't . His argument was 
based in large part on Sorenstam's 
acceptance of a sponsor's exemp-
tion onto the field, and on the 
Injustice of depriving a more 
deservmg man from an opportuni-
ty to play. 

From this perspective, I don't 
see Smgh'~ pomt. Sponsors' 
exemptions are routinely u.'oed on 
legends of golf who are well past 
their pnme - like Arnold Palmer 
- but draw crowds and make 
money for sponsors. Sorenstam 
has turned the Colomal IntO a 
media circus with nearly three 
times as man)' press passes Issued 
as compared to last year, and a 
nallonal spotlight ... hown bnghtly 
on a normally obscure tourna-
ment. 

CB has expanded Its coverage 
and the tournament sold out all 
four days - ",ell In advance - so 
the spon or's exemption seems to 
have served it; purpose. PGA tour 
player Ick Price said that 
orenstam's entry "reeks of public-

Ity;" but In a sense, that's the point. 
Singh's other argument IS that 

the women already have a tour. 
The Ladles Professional Golf 
Assoclaoon was establi hed In 1950 
and holds a strong follOWing in the 
Umted States. It is by no means the 
equal of the PGA - in presoge or 
pn7.t! money - but It nevertheless 
eXlsts as a way for women to play 
golf profeSSIOnally. You think thiS 

doe~n 't matter. You think thiS 
shouldn't make a difference. Then 
you hear about Bnan Kontak.

Whrle the LPGA's rule that 
allows only women to compete 
(the PGA has no gender-;peclfic 
gUidelines) provides a formidable 
hurdle In Kontak's quest, he 
bnngs up the clear double-stan -
dard . Ilow It is fair to let a woman 
compete with men, but not vlce-
versa' This Isn't little league or 
youth soccer, these are profe;slon-
al who stake their livelihood on

UCSD surf team qualifies for nationals 
Tritons' Plopper, Wilson win individual state titles 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD surf team compet-
ed in the state championships at 
Churche State Beach in San 
Clemente against the top 13 teams 
in the state on 1ay 10. 

The surf team narrowly lost to 
Mira Costa College by a score of 
99-94, but UCSD' Zach Plopper 
and Loyrn \Vilson won the covet-
ed men's and women's tate title, 
re pectively. Despite a second-
place finish, the five-time national 
champion surf team will be enter-
ing nationals, which take place on 
June 21 and 22 at Dana Point, 
Calif., with a econd-place seed, 
and hope to bring a Sixth naoonal 
title to UCSD. 

The surfing season, which con-
SISts of four events throughout the 
year, with 25 teams competing, 
saw the UCSD surf team take first, 
second, third and fifth place. The 
team finished the season in second 
place and was the highest rated 
four-year university in the 

ational Scholastic Surfing 
Association.

Surfs up: UCSD ccxaptain Aaron Napier rides a wave at a tournament earlier this year. The five-time national champion 
surf team IS coming off a second-place finish at the state championships and will compete at the nationals in June. 

"We had a big comeback this 
year - the surf team is back,» 
said co-captain Clinton Edwards. 
"And we're looking forwanl to an 
even better year next year. We 

have a professional surfer, and a 
Peruvian junior national champ 
who will be joining our team next 
year." 

The surf team's success is a 

reflection of its strong history 
and incredible resources. The 
team's five national titles is the 
second best total in SSA histo-
ry, and the surf team is over 20 

years old, making it one of the 
longest running club sPOrts at 

CSD.

Men's crew team holds its own at championships 
UCSD finishes in top three at peRCs and Pac-lOs 

By AMBER MARTIN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD mens varSIty and 
novice crews headed up to 
Sacramento for the la t race of 
the season at the PaCific Coast 
ROWIng ChamplonshJps on May 
17 and the Pac- I 0 ChampIOnship; 
on May 18. 

Shannon OlIver coxed the 
Tnton varsIty four, which was 
rowed by Enk Kuhle, Scott 
Destafney, Dan Toth and Leo 
Shook. At the PCRC races, they 
beat all V\ estern Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association and all 
DIVISion I and Il schools, except 
UC Berkeley, to place second out 
of eight schools. They finished 
two seconds behind Cal and 13 
seconds ahead of the tlurd-place 
crew afrer demolislung the com-

peotion rn the heat earlier in the 
day. 

. "Tlus was an rncredlble race, 
and 10 rng to Cal WIth everal 
national-team athlete in their 
boat showed that UC D has 
DIVIsion I speed," said UC D 
head coach Michael Filippone. 

Later, at the Pac-IO, the same 
varsity four was the only non-Pac-
10 team to medal all day, coming 
in third place, losing only to 
UniverSity of Wa hington and 
Berkeley. 

"UCSD has incredible varsity 
four and comrng in third to Cal 
and Washington, twO of the fastest 
varsity fours in the country, indi-
cated that UCSD can row with 
any varSllY four in the country,» 
said Washington head coach 
Colrn Sykes. 

The men's nOVIce eight also had

a successful weekend, beating orne 
of the varsity crews. UC D's eight 
of Alicia Zupic, Adam Homze, 

pencer Chen, Zack Ground, 
Mitch Degeus, Chnt Wayland, 
Todd Meyr, teven Oliver and 
Scon Toepfer completed the 2,000 
meters In just 6:30, coming in SL~th 
overall. 

At the PCRCs, UCSD raced 
the novice four with Zupic, 
Myer, Wayland, Toepfer and 
Olrver. They were able to over-
come WIRA hampion SDSU, 
but lost to Cal and UCLA, earn-
ing the bronze medal for the 
Tritons. 

"Tlus wa the bow four of our 
novice eight and they showed they 
can beat Cal [in the heat] and 
clearly beat WIRA champ an 
Diego State," Filippone said. 

The men's lightweight four 
also bettered their finrsh at the 
May 4 WIRAs. Zach Moresman, 
Ben Wang, Vince DaVIes, Landon 
Hawke and Terral Aval-Benson 
brought the ~r1ver back to San 
Diego, narrowly 10 ing to UC 
Berkeley. 

"I wanted to race the best ath-
lete~ as much a~ pos Ible and put 
them on the Irne and sec what 
would happen agalmt the best on 
the west coa t," Filippone said. 
"We brought our top varsity and 
novice oarsmen and put them on 
the line and each time they were 
rncredJble. " 

The varsIty eigh t at the Pac-
lOs reflects the coach's phrloso-
phy of comblnrng oarsmen of 
different levels. The boat was 
compnscd of team members 

Irver, Kuhle, Destafney, Toth, 
hook, Ground, Degeus, I Iomze 

and Chen. Homze and Chen are 
both varsity and novice athletes. 

uThls was the fastest the v-elght 

has gone all year, and it is incredible 
to consider that each of the athletes 
had already raced four our five 
omes. We beat crews that we had 
been unable to heat all year WIth 
five novice~ in the boat. Most 
impres ive is the fact that the v-
eight was 10 seconds faster in a 
completely new lineup. Mixing up 
the Irneups howed the depth of the 
U SD program," Filippone sa id 
about the var~ity eight. 

Regarding 3 long ~e3son with 
injUries and eventua l succcss, 
Filippone expressed hi cml-
ments. 

'" love c03chrng racers and 
these guys represented U SD 0 
well. In every ra e thl weekend, 
they went faster and rowed better 
than . they ever had before," 
Filippone said.
