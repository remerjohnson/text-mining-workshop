Boycott of NBC 
may have effect 

BY MARY MEEHAN 
Pacific New. Service 

WASHINGTON , D.C. -
The boycott again t RCA and 
NBC announced recent Iy by 
the Rev . Donald Wildmon oC 
the Coalition for Belter Televi-
sion may be more ucces. CuI 
t han net work execut ives 
expect. Beside it attraction 
for conservative Christians, 
the boycott ha potential 
appeal to minority groups, 
peace people. femini ' ts and 
parents of all kinds. 

One of t he boycotters' 
demands is that NBC increase 
the number of minority and 
elderly people shown on TV 
" a full. contributing 
members of society." Cer-
tainly the NAACP and the 
Gray Panthers would like to 
ee thi happen . Pacifi t 

would be delighted to see the 
achievement of another boy-
cott ~al - less violence on 
television. 

Many women will rejoice if a 
third boycott goal- an end to 
the advertising of "feminine 
personal hygiene products" on 
TV - can be achieved. Femi-
nists al a will be happy if the 
boycott results in less use of 
women 's bodies in commer-
cials to sell soap, deodorant 
and automobiles. And many 
parents. regardless of their 
polit ical or religious persua-
ion, are dismayed by the por-

trayals of sex. violence and 
drug use to which their child-
ren are expo ed on television. 
Reducing all of thi s is a central 
goal of the RCAINBC boycott. 

RCA is included because it is 
the parent company of NBC. 
Although the CoalitIOn for Bet-
ter Televi ion is crit ical of all 
commercial TV, it chose to 
concentrate on NBC because 
la t year a Christmas -related 
show of that network included 
an appearance by the Playboy 
Playmate. And RCA adver-
tised in the December issue of 
Playboy which included a sec-
tion entitled "Prarboy." Wild-
man say that thl "belitt led . 
mocked , and ridiculed Christ 
and Christians ... " 

Cynics believe the CoalitIon 
for Better Television also 
chose RCA BC becau~e the 
I wo corporations !-teem e~pe 
l'Ially vul nerable jusl now . 
RCA had a majO! cledlOl' rn 
earnrng~ last yea r and NHC 
has ratings problems. Also, 
RCA and It s sulhidl<lrIcs pro 
duce many goods I hm are 
vu lnerable to consumer IXly 
cott - tl'lev l",on sets. V1dl'O 
dl"c pIa, e....... records. ", ereo 

l"as~el II'S. lIertl renl al cars. If 
the bo wll catrhe~ on, It lOuld 
do serious damage to RCA and 
NBC . 

Bu tthe two corporations are 
hardly quaking In theIr bOOls 

at this point. Henry Bechtold , 
an RCA vice President in New 
York. notes telephone calls 
from as far away as California 
sayi ng, "Don'l pay attention to 
thiS guy" (Wildman). Bechtold 
declares that t he response has 
been "all po hive our way." 

Wildmon, on the other hand , 
'ays that reaction to the boy-
cott has been "beller than I 
had expected." He contends 
that he IS receiving strongsup-
port in the religious pres , 
which has "significant clout." 
Wildman plan some new -
paper advertising of the boy-
COlt, and he believes that 
RCAINBC may start hurting 
about four months from now. 

Some secular people, who 
might otherwise upport the 
boycott are troubled by the 
charges t hat it i a form of cen-
sorship. Yet the First Amend-
ment says nothing about 
pri vate efforts to persuade wri-
ter or speakers to a different 
point of view or a different 
kind of representation . 

It is not censorship when 
people cancel subscription~ to 
a newspaper because they are 
appalled by its news coverage 
or editorials; or when students 
protest by standing with their 
backs turned to a college com-
mencement speaker; or when 
people boycott consu mer pro-
duct. to show their displea-
sure with TV programming. 

The same First Amendment 
that protect s the broadcasters' 
right to say what they want 
also protect s the consumer's 
right to boycott. Talking back 
is the other side of the First 
Amendment coin_ 

Some liberals have a curious 
ambivalence toward the Coali-
tion for Better Television. a 
federation o( more than 1,800 
local and national groups 
socially can ervative and lar-
gely - but not exclusively -

The forgotten war: Iran 
and Iraq almost bled dry 

By MANSOUR FARHANG 
PMclll~ News Service 

NEW YORK - The I ~ 
month-old war between Iran 
and Iraq '0 far has cau ed 
50,000 death s, 200 ,000 
wounded, more than 10,000 
pri oners o( war, two million 
refugee and more than $400 
billion in material destruct ion. 
The combined income of Iran 
and Iraq from oil exports for 10 
years before the outbreak of 
the war amounted to less than 
$250 billion . 

Clearly . both countries, 
whose peoples share ancient 
affinitie ,are being bled dry by 
the war. And yet. given the 
present political context in the 
region and the position of the 
superpower. there is IiUle or 
no hope for an early end to the 

slau~hter. The war serves the 
political interesls of too many 
of the parties involved. 

From the beginning of the 
war epl. 22. 1980. when 
Iraq ' s addalll Hu ssein 
invaded Iran , the olher Per-
' ian Gulf states have drawn 
comfort from the fact that 
their two main sources of 
regional anxiety - Iraq's mil-
itary ambitions and Iran's 
threat to export the Islamic 
revolution - were neutraliz· 
ing each other. 

Hafez Assad of Syria was 
content to see his arch-enemy, 
Saddam Hussein , frustrated to 
an unwinnablewar. Israel was 
delighted to have I he Iraqi 
armed . forces en~aged and 
humiliated . Israeli-connected 
arms merchants in the Euro· 
pean black market became 
active in providin~ Iran with 
some o( Its crUCial military 
needs. 

Even I he superpowers found 
mutual benefit in the war_ The 

oVlet Un ion perceived I he 
war a~ an opportu nit y to make 
I ran depf'llclen I on il ~ wea pons 
and I ran~il routes. The war 
also wa~ useful in divert inl( 
Iran's altentlOn (rom the pres-
encl' of ~L1ssian I mops In 
nCI){hlxlflllg Afghunlslan. The 
Un il l'(l Stal C~ 'i<lW I tw war a H a 

po."itive development becaus 
It could only weaken the two 
countries regarded a. t.he 010, t 
troublesome in the Persian 
Gulf area . U strategists wer 
convi nced that the war could 
improve American-Iraqi rela-
tions and produce new ties 
bet ween Iraq and pro-
American Arab states_ 

This is t he first time since 
World War II that the United 
States and the Soviet Union 
are technically "neutral" in a 
war between the two strategi· 
cally important states. As a 
supplier of arms, directly and 
indirectly, to both Iran and 
Iraq, the Soviet Union has 
shown no concern over the 
prolongation of the war. Yet 
Iran 's Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini describes Saddam 
Hussein as the "American 
hand ," and Saddam Hussein 
refers to Khomeini as a "Zion-
ist dupe." 

Since the beginning, three 
peace missions. representing 
the Islamic Peace Committee. 
the Non-Aligned Minibterlal 
Commitlee and the United 
Nations. have visited Iran and 
Iraq . 

As fonner Iranian President 
Bani-Sadr's Rcnior foreign pol-
icy adviser, I was involved in 
the negotiations with the 
med iators unt it the l)lJster of 
Bani-Sadr inJune 1981. All the 
discu sions between the peace 
missions' deleg/ltions and Iran 
were in vain. Iraq asked (or a 
cease-fire follOwed by nesotia-
tion , while Iran demanded that 
the Iraqi troops withdraw 
first. Only once did an effort of 
the Non·Aligned Ministerial 
Committee to create a demilit -
arized zone. including both 
Iraqi and Iranian territory, 
seem to have a chance of aCre!l-
lance, but it cullapsed abrupt y 
and mysteriously (lne year a).lll. 

No governmenl in lran can 
afford I () accept a (' ase-fin' 
while till' Iraqi Irnop:-o remain 
on Iranian soi l. And Saddam 
Hus:-ot!1Jl ii'> mnvint'ed that he 
ca nnot wi l hdraw wi t hout a 
tanglbll' achievement til JUS 

tHy the human and material 
cost of his adventure.The Iraqi 
troops in Iran . uffer from low 
morale as a result of the long 
stalemate. whitt' the Iranian 
troops, which are defending 
their homeland, evidently 
remain hiJlhly committed. 

Iraq. with a population les 
than a third of Iran 's 38 mil 
lion, has exhausted her capac-
ity to expand the war and no 
longer can take heavy casual· 
ties. But Iran cannot expand 
the war either, Even if Iran ' 
military and economic prob-
lems uddenly di 'appeared , 
the constellation of powers in 
the Middle East and the super· 
power intere t in the re"ion 
would prevent Khomeini 's mil-
itary victory. Iranian troops 
have rl!gained part of the 8rl!aS 
occupied by Iraq in the early 
days of the war, but they can-
not push I he Iraqis back com-
pletely in the forseeable 
fUlure. 

Both countries are running 
short o( funds to finance the 
war. Two-thirds of Iraq 's oil 
industry either ha. been des-
troyed by Iran ian attacks or 
brought to 1\ standstill because 
of danKers involved in oil ship-
ping. Iran's hard currency 
reserves are exhausted and 
she '0 (ar has failed to secure 
any new loans. While Iran has 
to pay for all her weapons pur-
chases in cash, li he cannot 
even ell enough oil to pay for 
the essential food imports . 

Though Saudi Arabia , 
Kuwait and United Arab Emi-
rates have given Iraq more 
than $20 billion in grantll and 
loans , this does not solve Iraq 's 
key problem of personnel shor-
tage, King Hussein's decision 
to recruit Jordanian volun· 
leers to fight for Iraq insidethe 
Ira nian territory is a prupa 
ganda ploy with lillie If any 
mililary value.

NBC boycott 
continued from page 2 

Government action is pre-
cisely what the Fir t Amend-
ment was intended to prevent, 
yet ACT urge government 
actIon and berates people who 
try to make changes through 
pri vate aClion alone. 

Wri ting in MS. magazi ne 
last November. feminist Glo-
ria Steinem sharply criliclzed 
the Coalition for Better Televi-
sion and the Moral Majority. 
which was then a member of 
the Coalition but has since 
withdrawn . Curiously. her 
cri tiCIsm directly followed a 
paragraph in which she said 
that American women "are 
watchmg the 'ring around the 
collar' commercial on televi-
sion. They are wait ing for the 
day when the wife turns to her 
husband and says: 'Why don 't 
you wash your neck?' " 

Feminists have long com-
plained about the demeaning 
portrayal of women in TV com-
mercials. It makes sense for 
them to add their own specific 
demands to those of the Coali-
tion for Better Television and 
to join a boycott that may force 
t he broadcasters to pay 
aU ention _ 

Liberals need not fear that 
they somehow will be contami-
nated by joining religious con-
<;ervatives in I~)ycott. In fact. 
Amencans of all political per-
suasions in effect alread\ are 
boycotting TV programs -with 
many of the same grievances. 
Nor does t he boycott threaten 
I he Bill of Right :. As Wildman 
says. RCA and NBC are "free 
to continue their discnmma-
tlOn. free torefuselo honorour 
requests .. . We have no power 
except the IX)wer of moral 
persuasion_ .. 

Forgotten war 
continued from page 2 
Thus he makes no diplomatic 
effort to pres ure Iraq to with-
draw from Iran. In fact. his 
continuing advocacy of export-
ing the I lamic revolution is 
the principle reason for the pol-
itical and material upport 
given to Iraq by the Persian 
Gulf states. 

Khomeini waits for the fall 
of addam Hussein to end the 
war, and Hussein, knowing 
that t he war cannot be won 

militarily. is waiting for the 
expected upheavals following 
Khomeini's deat h_ 

Thus. at present. there is lit-
tle mcentive either in the 
region or among the uperpow-
ers to eek a ettlement. In the 
meantime. the peoples of Iran 
and Iraq. faced with the irra-
tionality and repre sivene s of 
their own rulers. are destroy-
ing each other's lives and 
re.ourees. with the inexorable 
force of classical tragedy.

Debate over the referendum

to table the matter.

Proponents, lead by Mark Dia-
mond, Re\'el\e Representative 
to t he AS, claim t he referen-
dum question will resu lt in 
more re s pon s iv e stu dent 
government. 

"Essentially, it would des-
t ro)' the AS a ' we know it," 
sa id AS president Jul es 
Bagneris. 

"It would spell di_ aster not 
only for student's representa-

tion on campus, but for stu 
dtmt organIzations, for vanous 
serv ices which are offered -
like the SCURI grant center 
and the AS internship office. It 
would cripple the lect ure note 
series wh ich has recen t ly 
expanded its operat ions to 
include the soft reserves." 

"Immediately we are look-
ing at losing 2/3 or more of our 
funds_" Bagnens sa id . 

However, ,Mark Diamond, 
who spon ored the bill. says, 
"The basis of the whole hill is 
not to cut down student 
government. it's to make it 
more effective." 

" It 's important to look at 
\\ hat the role of the student 
government is - we're not all 
money_ It doe!'; take some admi-
nistrative costs, but a lot more 
can be done on less money." 

Dia mond also stated that 
st udent activities would 
increase as a result of more 
organizations holding fund

Lecturers complain to Assembly 
about low university status 

By HENRY SCH ULMAN 
Sacramento Corresponde nt 

SACRAMENTO - Three 
University of California lec-

subcommittee that non -

to an "underclass," and are 
considered "second-class

The university hires lectur-

foreign language and math 
courses. 

Full-time faculty. on the

expected to spend an average 
of nine hours per week more 
than full professors in 
c1a'isroom-related act ivity_ 

Under guidelines initiated 
this year, lecturers are hired 
with the understanding that 
their positions are temporary, 
lasting a maximum of four 
years. 

Of the 1.500 lecturers in the 
UC system, 128 have so-called 

~ecurity of employment, sim-
ilar to tenure for full faculty 
which grant them indefinite 
employment at the university_ 

"Lecturers are the cheape t

saId UC Santa Barbara lev 
turer Mark Fererr. "The lec-
turer's position does not hme 
t he same clout, and t he same 
protection in the system

Residency bill passes subcommittee 
By HENRY SCHULMAN 

Sacrnmenlo Corre.pondenl 
SACRAMENTO - Assem-

blymember Gary Hart last 
week won s ubcommittee 
approval of hi bill to exempt 
graduate teaching assistants 
(T As) and re earch aid from 
tough, new tate residency 
requirements, but he admitted 
the measure will face a 
tougher ride in the rest of the 
Legi lature. 

The Democrat from Santa 
Barbara aid he introduced the 
bill at the request of UCSB 
teacher and administrators, 
who complained the chool 
lagged behind other in the 
nation in recruiting TAs from 
other states. 

Piper 
continued from page 5 
imporLant issue, the ten people 
who were expo ed to Vos-Ban. 
That wa n't even brought 
up. " 

Piper wa referring back to 
june when the Primary Care 
Clinic employee returned to 
work on two consecutive Mon-
day to find that the pesticide 
had been sprayed by Piper's 
supervisor over the weekend. 
Piper continued . "That' a 
serious issue. I'm not going to 
let that drop." 

As to his plans for the 
future , Piper i ' "definitely 
looking into" ways to recover 
the 17 days of back pay. "From 
here on, it will have to be in the 
court sy tem," he said . 

He also wa n't too ure 
about his fut ure job. "I think 
they've eliminated my job at 
University Hospital, but they 
are supposed to give me an 
equivalent position .. .I don't 
know when. For now I'm just 
still pulling weeds." 

The reason, he said, were 
res idency req u i remen t 
approved last year which 
require st udents to be pra ti-
cally independent from their 
familie to take advantage of 
the university's low·cost resi -
dent fee .. 

tudent s previou sly had 
only ro live in California one 
year before gaining residency . 
Now, however, they must not 
be claImed as exemptions from 
their parent s' income taxes, 
must not live with their par-
ents more than six weeks dur-
ing the year, and mU!'lt not 
receive more than $750 of 
financial a istance from 
them, 

The new requirements were 
designed to prevent out-of-
s tate students whose parents 
never contributed taxes here 
from taking advantage of Cali-
fornia 's inexpensive higher 
education. • 

Bu t Hart test ified beftlre the 
As embly Postsecondary Edu-
cat ion Subcommittee yester-
day that talented graduate 
tudent are opting for other 

prominent universities around 
the country which exempt 
them from residency require-
ment . Educators, he aid, told 
him they fear a drop in local 
educational quality. 

Speaking on behalf of the 
bill, UC Santa Barbara chem-
i try professor Michael Bow-
er compared the competition 
for good TAs with any compet-
itive market, arguing "we 
have to provide (residency 
requirement) waivers for 
them. They won't come 
otherwise." 

Bowers and other educator 
testified good TAs are neces-
sary ince their major duty i 
lecturing undergraduates. 
They added good re earch 
assistants help draw federal 

and private re earch funds. 
With little di cussion, the 

subcommittee voted 4-0 to 
end t he bill to the full commit-

tee. Subcommittee Chair 
Teresa Hugh es, D-Los 
Angeles, also directed univer-
ity official to prepare a 

report detailing the percentage 
of minority _ tudent s the bill 
would affect. 

In all, as many as 1,000 grad-
uate students would benefit 
from t he legislation at a cost of 
up to $1 million in lost student 
fees. 

Hart admitted the revenue 
reduction would hurt the mea-
sure 's chances of passing the 
As embly Way and Mean 
Committee, led by budget-
consciou john Va concellos, 
D·San jose, whc has indicated 
he would oppose any bill cost-
ing the state more money. 

When a ked in the subcom-
mittee how he intended to pay 
for the bill, Hart quipped, ''I'll 
jump off that bridge when I 
come to it." 

But he added, "This is the 
first bill 1 have carried relating 
to the UC in my eight years in 
the Legislature. I have not 
seen more concern directed at 
an issued than the one this bill 
tries to address." 

Hart aid after the hearing 
he was encouraged with the 
ubcommittee's unanimity in 

approving the bill, which 
prompted no formal opposi-
tion. 

The subcommittee also 
voted 4-0 to approve a bill giv-
ing more students the chance 
for membership on the state 
Student Aid Commission 

On a similar vote, the sub-
committee approved a resolu-
tion ca lling for California's 
Congressional delegation to 
, upport tudent financial aid 
no lower than the 1981 level.

Student arrested in 
com,puter shain 

San Diego police arrested 
Wesley Blake Snell, a third 
College Computer science 
major on suspicion of 40 
counts of forgery, burglary, 
and grand theit involving 
$19,500 of computer 
equipment. 

According to police, Snell 
forged university purchase 
orders in increments of$IOO 
to $1000 to acquire the 
equipment from local elec-
tronics stores. 

Police apprehended Snell 
after $9,330 was embezzled 
and forged from a Radio 
Shack electronics store at 
which Snell was employed. 
Snell was indentified from a 
photography given to police 
by the Radio Shack store 
manager. 

Detective William Bird of 
the San Diego police depart-
ment termed Snell a 
"smooth '.' operator who 
forged "official" looking 
purchase orders under the 
guise of a purchasing agent 
for UCSD. 

Most of all, said Bird, 
Snell was successfu l 
because he did the purchas-
ing near closing hours of 
electronic stores. 

Snell was released from 
ja il by municipal judge Fred 
Link after being held in leiu 
$82,000 bail. 

Snell was considered to be 
quite bright in computer 
science even though his 
grade point average ranged 
in the 'C' level.

CSA hears lecturer's gripes 
continued from page 5 
lecturer Suzanne Cowan, is 
the lack of communication 
between the univer ity and 
lecturer concerning their job 
status. 

Cowan recounted the expe-
rience of one lecturer, who 
after six years of teaching, was 
reclassified to a position wher-
eby he was ineligible for secur-
ity of employment. Mean· 
while, the university gave him 
conflicting messages concern-
ing his future at the campus. 

That lecturer is still uncer-
tain al ut his fate, she said 
and "t he chaos which has been 
created has had a negat ive 
effect not on ly on his morale, 
but on the program he 
teaches. " 

Further problems with lec-
tureships expressed ye terday 
were inability to join faculty 
organizations. last-minute hir-
ing and firing which adversely 
affect teaching, and large tur-
nover which hampers conti-
nuity of educational programs. 

Responding for the univer-
sity , Archie Kliengartner. Vice 
Pres ident for Academic and 
Staff Personnel Relat ions, said 
lect u rers have t he same aca-
demic and creatl\'e freedom 
afforded all faculty, \\ ith 
avenues availab le for 
grievanc s. 

Academic Senate Vice Presl' 
dent Robert Connick sa id lee 
t urers are hired specifically to 
teach, with the understanding 
that their jobs are temporary, 

and should not raise their own 
expectations about their 
futures at the university. 

He al 0 pointed out the pro-
grams which use the largest 
proportion of non-tenurable 
lectu rers are not very demand-
ing, and the university gi\'es 
them a lower priority. In some 
cases, Connick added , the 
courses s hould have been 
taught at the high school level , 
such as Subject A. beginnmg 
math and introductory foreIgn 
language cour'ies. After nearl} 
two hours of testlmon\. the

Third College R.A. 
hassles continue 

The controversy over the 
selection of Third College 
Re ident Advisors for next 
fall continues. Beverly 
Varga, Dean of Third 
College , announced last 
Monday that she planned to 
re-open the 12 positions for 
next year's RA staff after 
reportedly being dissat is-
fied with the representation 
of minorities in the final 
candidates. 

Students feel that one 
way to insure thal an 
adequate number of 
minorities apply for RA 
positions next year I~ to 
improve communication. 
The group agreed thilt the 
jobmu t be po ted with a 
generally accepted applica-
tion deadline. Furthermore, 
~tudents felt that twO 
weeks before the applica-

tion period be~an and two 
week before Its deadline, 
SAAC organizations should 
be notified so that these 
group can ensure that all 
students are made aware of 
the RA selection period. 

At the same time, the 
students at last night's 
meeting felt that future 
se!t:ctJOn committee· for 
Third College RAs hould 
lake the "multiLUltural 
environment" of Third 
College mto account when 
intervlewtng RA candi· 
dates . Only then Will 
students feel that there is 
proper representatIon of all 
students at Third , saId one 
student. 

Tuesday , students take 
their counter-proposals 
back to Varga as the RA 
selection process continues 
to remain stalled.

Lecture hosts Revelle DOOIISIUI! 
Profe sors Roger Revelle 

and Ru ell Doolittle are 
among the distinguished 
scienti ts who will examine 
the ethical and ocial implica-
tions of the remarkable pace at 
which society i being pro-
pelled into the new technologi-
cal age in a five-week lecture 
series being offered April 8-
May 6 by Cal PIRG, t he Califor-
nIa Public lnterest Research 
Group_ 

"Science, Technology and 
the Public lntere t," the theme 
of the Thur day evening ser-
ies, will explore the relation-
hip between clentific 

priorities and social needs 111 
several controversial areas_ 

The lecture series, which 
will be offered free-of-charge, 
is sponsored by CalPIRG's 
Community Science Center, a 

ational Science Foundation 
program designed to make 
cientific information availa-

ble to con umers and to 
encourage their informed par-
ticipat ion in critical areas of 
public policy_ Each night's pro-
&'Tam will run from 7:30-10 
p_m.: student and community 
members in the audience will 
be invited to join the exchange 
during the 45-minute 
question-answer session fol -
lowing each lecture. 

Revelle, Director Emeritus 
of Scripps Institution of Ocea-
nography, will introduce the 
series this Thursday, address-
ing the subject "Science, 
Ethics and Politics." Revelle 
will offer hi!> views on the ethi-

cal principles of science and 
discuss the effect of changing 
polit ical influences on scien-
tific exploration. 

The risks and benefits posed 
by future applications of com-
puter tech nology, especially 
its impact on individuals'lives 
as workers, consumers, and as 
private citizens is the subject 
of t he second program, sche-
duled for April 15, "The Com-
puterized Consumer : Risks 
and Benefits." 

Week three actiVItIes will 
focus on "Ground Zero Week," 
a program of educat iona I 
events about the character, 
and consequences, of nuclear 
war. The week-s activities are 
sponsored by Ground Zero, a 
non-parti sa n organization 
which included Physicians for 
Social Re ponsibility and the 
Union of Concerned Scien-
tists. Recent con trover y 
over guidelines for genetic 
engineering and t h role of pri-
vate industry in setting 
research prioritie in the field 
lend special interest to the 
topic of the April 29 program_ 
On that night, Russell Doolit-
tle, chairperson of UCSD's 
Department of Chemistry, will 
lecture on "The ocial Con e-
quences of Bio-Engineering." 

The last program of the ser-
ies. scheduled for May 6, will 
bring Harry Snyder of Consu-
mers' Union, publishers of

Natural fission reactor test 
case for waste storage 

Natural fiSSIon reactors in the Oklo 
uranium mines in Afrka t hal were 
active Iwo billion years ago, have done 
a remarkably good job of cuntaining 
most of their nuc1earwaste. That'sthe 
opinion expressed in a paper presented

Chemical Society in Las Vegas, Nev ·

Ihat imJXlftant fission products from 
the reactors traveled le8'< I han a

Happy members of the Repertory Dan e Theatre of Los Angeles will play here tomorrow night. 

L.A. dance group steps in 
A variety of styles will be 

presented Tuesday night, 
when the Repertory Dance 
Theatre of Los Angeles makes 
a special appearance at UCSD. 

The group, founded in 1977, 
is dedicated to integrating 
rhythm·ba ed movement with 
other dance forms . The Com· 
pany con ists of 8 to 10 
dancers trained in Ballet, Dun· 
ham Techniques, Modern and 
Jazz, adding an interesting 
diversity to their performan· 
ces. Popular dance trends have 
too long been divorced from 
other dance forms. Due to the 
fact that one dance form is a 
derivative of its predecessor, 
their complimentary nature 

should be ' apparent. To this 
end. the Repertory Dance 
Company of Los Angles com· 
bine street dance , ballet, Dun· 
ham and modern jazz dance 
form . 

Director Jon Johnson , 
founder of the Company, 
began working with the group 
in 1977 a part of a CETA pro· 
gram at the Ebony Showcase 
Theatre. When the CETA· 
funded program was cancelled 
in December 1980 due to fed· 
eral budget cuts, John on 
began to rehearse with 12 
former CETA participants 
who were still interested in 
dancing. A few months later, 
Lambert Mitchell contacted 

Atomicafe presents its 
first concert of spring 

Atomicafe. UCSD's forum 
for composers , will present its 
first concert of the Spring this 
Tuesday , at 8 p.m. in Mande· 
ville Recital Hall. Since its 
inception, Atomicafe has pre · 
ented a wide and representa· 
tive array of what is current in 
new mu. ic , and thi s concert 
will prove to be no exception. 

gi t Claude Levi·Strauss· sem· 
inal work, Le Cm et Ie Cuil, 
and Victor Zupanc's Metro 
Banana. Elma Mayer's Song 
exemplifies the populist Irend 
in music with its contempor-
ary setting of a traditional Ger· 
man children' song. Tonal 
and minimalist tendencies can 
be found in Jame oe Nyun 's 
piano 010 work. Ten Ullder· 
line. AI 0 on the program. but 
more indefinable as to style 
will be two other piece forsolo 
piano: Linda Seltzer's My 
Heart Is Bereft and Carlo Lan· 
dini's 5ix Nocturnes. 

Johnson becau e he wanled to 
sponsor a dance group. Thus 
the Dance group started work· 
ing with Mitchell and since 
that time have been presenting 
productions at various colleges 
throughout Los Angele . 

"Danse Negre," theme of the 
concert. meaning " Black 
Dance," will be a combination 
of Dunham Technique. ballet. 
modern and jazz modes

• Cal 'WIns cup 
UCSD crews prove themselves 

BY DAN B TCHER 
SI,,11 Wriler 

If nothing el ·e. UCSD 
proved they belonged in last 
Saturday's Crew Classic . 
Although UCSD did not win 
any of the races of national 
interest. the Triton crew con· 
sistently finished in the top 
three places in the preliminary 
heats. 

Rowing against the best 
competition offered anywhere 
in the country. all but two of 
the boats with blue and gold 
oars were able to make the 
finals - the goal of most of the 
teams entered in the presti· 
gious field . 

When the finaL arrived, 
however, it was obvious that 
the Tritons' bold attempt to 
gain respect as a national 
power wa, going to fall short, 
as on the P.A., UC 'an Diego 
was frequently preceded by 
the phrase "and trailing the 
field." 

Often, the home water 
advantage and impeccable 
form displayed by the UCSD 
crew wa negated by a strong 
wind , causing poor water con· 
ditions and the physical super· 
iority of the other crew . The 

Tritons were usually able to 
jump out to aquick lead follow· 
ing the start, but could not 
hold on to the slight edge for 
long, as the stronger schools of 
the Pac·lO were able to mu cle 
their way into the lead , and 
invariably had s trong finishes. 

The only Triton victory of 
the day was posted by the 
women's lightweight crew. H 
wa clear from the beginning 
of the race that coach Jack Val · 
lerga's group would reaffirm 
its s tronghold on the light· 
weight divi sion established uy 
last year's undefeated crew. 
UC 0 opened up an early lead 
and lengthened it throughout 
the 1,000 meter course, even· 
tually winning by over 5 
second . 

In comparison to UCSD, the 
other crews entered, Cal State 
Long Beach, Loyola Mary· 
mount and San Diego State, 
appeared to be working much 
harder. As the Triton light· 
weights gracefully and 
methodically moved down the 
bay barely exerting them· 
selves, the other crews, with a 
flurry of motion (resembling a

futilely tried to catch up. The

had barely finished when the 
UCSD crew was on hore. joy· 
fully jumping up and down in 
the arms of a visibly pleased 
Jack Vallerga. 

Vallerga remarked after the 
race that he was especially 

pleased With hIS crew's perfor· 
mance because they appeared 
to be immune to the " pres.ure 
that is on t hem In every race as 
a result of being on top. " He 
feels that his crew "is pointed 
to as the team to beat, and It is 
much easier to be second than 
on top." If their performance 
thus far is any indication of 
what is to come. Vallerga may 
have many sleepless nights In 
the future. as the Women' s 
lightweight crew seems intent 

on remamIng on top for a long

Worn out Ruggers lose to State 
BY TYNA CALLAHAN 

Staff Wriler 
"UC D win!" was the cry 

resounding from the blue hud-
dle as aturday's rugby match 
again t San Diego tate Uni-
versity began. Unfortunately. 
it didn 't end that way. The 
Aztecs won the Michelob 
Game of the Week by outdoing 
the Tritons, 14·7 on Muir 
Field. 

It wa in the econd half that 
UCSD lipped . After having 
held a 7-0 lead in the fir t half. 
they let it go, s lowly but 
s urely . "We got tired ... we just 
got tired, and then we can't 
think. We only practiced two 
or three time la t week." 
Team captain Jon chleimer 
ex plained that t he team wa. 
out of hape, havi ng ju t got-
ten back from break. 

had aspired to regain the 
team's honor with a win. the 
Tritons v. ere again defeated 
by the Aztecs, 19-12. Things 
looked bad from the start as 
State opened rhe game by scor-
ing t he first three points on a 
penalty kick and then six more 
on a converted try. The 9-0 
lead did not look promising for 
UCSD's seconds. 

The match was interrupted 
for a whIle when, in keeping 
wit h rugby's brutal reputa-
tion. the Triton's l ohn Bridge-
man emerged from the mud 
with what was later confirmed 
to be two broken wrists. 

After the actIOn resumed, 
Cameron Oslar was the first to 
score for CSU's seconds 
when he touched for a try. 
earning t hem four points. 

In the second half , an 
Diego State scored their 
second tr}. but weren't able to 

cOOl'ert It. and their lead 
climbed to l:l·4. 

Creg Haker of the Triton ' 
scored t he next try to pull I he 
team up a little 10 8- 13. lale 
managed anal her try of Iheir 
own though, and arned the 
I wo point convers ion. They 
were off agam, 19-8. 

Just as time was running 
out. Ken Davenport st retched 
to touch for Ihe las t score of 
the game. Davenport's four 
points were not enough to win 
the game. bUI they lightened 
t.he loss a little, making the 
final score 19-12fortheAztec . 

This po t- eason game was 
the last to be played here this 
year. The Tritons finished the 
season with a league record of 
4-2 and placed I hird in the Col-
lege Playoffs which were held 
last month in Long Beach. 
Next weekend t he team will 
travel nori h for the UC Santa 
Barbara Tournament. '

came on a pectacu lar play in 
which Jacques Kirch and 

teve Gaffney exchanged lat-
eral pa ses down the field until 
Kirch finall y glided into the 
endzone to bring the score up 
to 7-0. That was the last time 
UCSD would score in that 
match. 

Tritons finish second in track meet 

The remainder of the game 
was penalty-ridden and sloppy 
a the Aztecs pulled in 14 
unanswered points. When the 
Michelob Player of the Week 
was cho en, no one was ur-
pri ed that he was from San

Saturday, April 3, the UCSD 

track team hosted a quadran-
gular meet against USIU, Cal 
State Dominguez Hills , and 
the an Diego Athletic Associ-
ation, at windswept Palomar 
College. The final score in the 
men's competition was SDAA, 
84; UCSD. 43; USlU, 37; 
Dominguez Hills, 3. In the 
women 's competition UCSD 
scored 38 points to USIU's 3. 

The meet was originally 
scheduled to be held at the 
Warren campus track , but due 
to the mushy conditions the 
meet was moved to the all-

weather track at Palomar 
College. 

The UCSD contingent fared 
about as well as expected, 
according to Triton Coach 
Andy Skief. tJSIU made a poor 
s howing due to illness, injury 
and basic absenteeism, while 
SDAA made a tronger show-
ing than expected. Dominguez

the trip. 

The 440 relay got things off 
to an exciting start. USIU

Spikers flattened by Long Beach; 
oppose number-one UCLA next 

BY ELANA ROSEN 
"A bit cold " would most 

accurately describe t he play of 
the UC D men's volleyball 
team against Cal State Long 
Beach on Friday. 

IX)inted with the level of play 
demonstrated by both learns, 
he described I he match as 
being far from their best. and 
that the lack of practice led to a 
game with rather "unevent-
ful " points. He also com-
mented that a sense of 
"leadership and cohesiveness 
was lackin g," partia ll y 
because of t he loss of co-
captain Hal Jacobs. 

ted to spike t he ball. It unmlen-
lIonally hit his head , and was 
then successfully sent into 
Long Beach \ court. 

The match was quickly 
determined - within the first 
three games - a Long 
Beach's consistent offensive 
and defensive play dominated 
the court , resultingin scores of 
15-10, 15-2. 15-5. 

Dannevl k is opt imistic that 
following games will improve, 
merely because the players are 
back to a regu lar practice sche-
dule, and will confront future 
opponenls with greater 

~trength . 

Although the Triton spiker 
displayed tremendous effort as 
they held their opponents at 13 
and cored five consecutive 
points, climbing from 5-13 to 
10-13, Long Beach eventually 
captured the first game, at 15-
10. 

Overall, though , the match 
was filled with a few spectacu-
lar performances. Both senior 
Monty Franco and Captain 
Rick Cazarez controlled a 
great deal of the three games 
with powerful spiking and 
accurate bloc king . Amid 
UCSD's Ouctuating po se -
sion , Adam Cherry executed 
consi 'tent serving, contribut-
ing to the Triton 's coreboard . 

The team 's next home game 
will be against UCLA, ranked 
number one in the country, 
aturday , April 17, at 2:00. -

UC D coach Doug Dan-
nevik explained that a combi-

The UCSD Guardian Monday, AprilS, 1982 

Scott Allison-J im AgrOl;tick Commentary 

UCSD plagued by apathetic athletes 
Ai/hough Allison and Agrotlick are former 
Guardja~l staff writers, their opinions and obser-
vations do not reflect those of the Guardia" sports 
department or the newspaper as a whole, 

As member of the UC D alumni and as 
former Guardian sportswriters. we share a 
common concern for the future of UCSD inter-
collegiate athletics, At this time last year. sig-
nificant strides were being taken towards 
improving the sport program, At that time, 
student athletes were busy organizing the 
Triton Intercollegiate Athletic Associalion, 
coaches were meeting with ath letic administra-
tors. a forum on UCSD athletics with Chancel-
lor Atkinson was held, and the TfAA's first 
at hletic banquet was a success. 

Now. one year later, it seems as if apathy. the 
prideof UC D. once again reign upreme, This 
apathy is found at all level ,but it begins at the 
top of the P,E. Department with it s chairman, 
Howard Hunt. As cited in a previous Guardian 
issue. Hunt is so preoccupied with interests 
out ide the realm of UCSD athletics that he 

hows no real concern for the conflicts within 
hi own department. According to Hunt (q uoted 
in la st year 's Guardian), "We havea very ound 
program here." True, the UCSD athletic pro-
f,rram has been steadily improving, but the 
credit for this is due mainly to individual ath-
letes and coaches_ 

Athletic Director Judy Sweet has made some 
effort to unite the coaches by holding weekly 
breakfasts for them. but her efforts have not 
been substantial enough to encourage the 
coaches' attendance. The coaches, on the other 
hand. are more to blame than anyone else. 
Because of their influence over the athletes, 
they are in a good position to effect change. But 
few have used this influence to their advantage. 
The on ly coache who have hown any intere_ t 
in these breakfast meetings have been John 

Block, Doug Dannevik and Bill Morgan. Where 
is everybody else? 

Thi apathy in turn spill over to the entire 
UCSD student body, According to Bob Conlin, 
president of the TIAA, "the student apathy here 
is overpowering. It ' a career undertaking to 
change anything around here," Thi is best 
exemplifi ed by Conlin ' involvement with the 
TIAA. Created last yea r, this ath letes' organiza-
tion was heralded as the savior of UCSD at hlet-
ics but is now in serious danger of folding due to 
student-at hlete apathy, coach apathy, apathy "t 
the administrative level , and any other apat~ . . 
you can think of. 
- 'The TIAA had so much potential and still 
does," said Conlin, "but everyone is so apa-
thetic that even I am getting to the point that f 
don't care." Conlin is quick toadmitthat part of 
the problem i due to his lack of experience at 
leading the organization. But on the other hand. 
Conlin has carried most of the weight in the 
organization and has received little help from 
TfAA members and coaches, All TlAA events 
have been successfu l. all hough the organiza-
tion itself is floundering due to apathy, 

Even the GlIardiall itself is not free from 
blame. The Guardian hold agrealdealofinflu -
ence over st udent attitudes in its presentation 
of material. It's the Guardiall's dut y to inform 
the student s as to the current status of UCSD 
athlet ics and not to paint a false "golden" image 
of t he true situation. The Guardian should 
attack the I . ues and not simply report them . It 
is up to the Guardiau to playa leadingjournalis-
tic role in promoting change. Can GIIa1'dia'l 
sportswriters look at UCSD's athletic depart-
ment in relation to schools of equal size and -t ill 
claim that everything is A-OK? 

To conclude, something significant was 
accomplished last year. but unles coaches. 
players and students take an active role in 
upgrading the athletic program and st rengthen-
ing the TIAA. all of last year's efforts and tho -e 
of preceding years will have been in vain, I Station and we want I YOU to join this mind- I Crew
