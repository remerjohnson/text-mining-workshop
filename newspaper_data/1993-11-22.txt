Police ProtectIon 
CrItIcIzed Aft. Rape 
SAN DlEGO- In the 
aftermath of two sexual 
assults near the San Diego 
State University Campus, 
fearful residents have ques-
tioned whether police pres-
ence in the College Area is 
adequate. According to James 
Shirey, apartment manager of 
College West Apartments 
where the rapist last struck, a 
police car cruising into the 
heavily student-populated cul-
de-sac is a rare sight. Shirey 
said he wanted a commitment 
from either San Diego State 
University police or the San 
Diego Police Department to 
identify periods of high crime 
and to patrol dunng those 
times. 

Alulnnl to Revoke 
a.'. Liquor License 
RIVERSIDE - UC 
Riverside's Alumni Associa-
tion has decided not to 
sponsor the Barn, a campus 
pub, when the group renews 
its license to serve alcohol 
next year. For the past 15 
years, the association has held 
a service agreement with the 
Barn, allowing the bar to be 
covered under its license. The 

deci~ion was prompted by a 
two-car accident in which one 
of the drivers, a 19-year-old 
UCR freshman, had pur-
chased alcohol at the Barn. 

UCD Administrators 
Go Back to School 
DAVIS -In an effort to 
compensate for budget cuts 
and provide an improved line 
of communication between 
the students and administra-
tion, acting UC Davis 
Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef 
is encouraging senior 
administrators who have 
faculty appointments to return 
to the classroom. According 
to Vanderhoef, having 
administrators teach classes 
will free up departmental 
resources.

Regents Raise Hospital $alaries 
MEmNG: UC students voice 
concerns about fees, financial aid 
as board approves budget 

spite of the ongoing UC budget crisis that has 
led to fee hikes, alary cuts and layoffs in 
other places. The pay increases will be subsi-
dized by hospital fund . 

How They Voted 

By ErIn Allday 
Daily Californian 

Regent Glenn Campbell, who voted against 
the increases, criticized the policy. "It's going 
to enrage the students. And they have every 
right to be enraged," Campbell said. 

On Friday, the regents voted 
to increase salaries for the 
University of California's 
hospital executives. Here's 
how each regent voted: 

At a meeting in which University of Cali-
fornia students voiced their concerns about a 
proposed fee increase, the UC Board of Re-
gents voted to raise the salaries of hospital 
executives by an average of21 percent begin-
ning next year. The regents also approved the 
proposed 1994-95 state-funded budget fort he 
UC system. 

Meeting at UC San Francisco, the regents 
approved the pay hikes by a vote of 13 to 5, in 

But UC officials said the executive salary 
increases are necessary to maintain a com-
petitiveedgeat the teaching hospitals, located 
at UCSD, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA and 
UCSF. 

According to a study conducted last July 
comparing UC hospi tals to 200 comparable 
universities' hospitals nationwide, UC sala-

BUDGET: Schwartz call for cutting exe utive 
salaries, lowering fees and raising faculty pay 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

UC Berkeley Physics Profes-
sor Charles Schwartz, a self-pro-
claimed "conscientious whistle-
blower " who has been appealing 
to the regent for over a year to 
consider his alternati ve budget plan 
for the Universi ty of California, 
presented his budget proposal once 
more at the Board of Regents meet-
ing in San Francisco last Thurs-
day. 

Schwartz said that after the re-
gents listened to his proposal , they 
approved their own budget plan . 
"I suggested to them that they be 
more than a rubber stamp. IButl 
they stick with their president, they 
support their team ," he said. 

After more than a year of re-
searching the UC budget, Schwartz 
has come up with a proposal that 
includes cuts to the UC adminis-
tration, executive salaries, UC 
hospitals and medical schools and 
construction projects. Funds gen-
erated from these cuts would go 
toward making the third Volun-
tary Early Retirement Incentive 

Program (V RIP) unnece~~ary, 
giving faculty a 10 percent pay 
raise and reducing student fee~ by 
$1,000. 

Schwanz has been allowed to 
speak at several regents ' meetings 
in the past, if only for a short time. 
''They gave me about two and a 
half minutes to speak," he said, 
adding, ' 'That' s about typical." 

UC spokesman Mike Alva re-
jected Schwanz's proposal. "UC 
doesn' t feelthar it's workable. We 
don't believe that his budget plan 
is the best for the uni versi ty," said 
Alva, adding that the university's 
mi ss ions s impl y conflic t with 
Schwartz's philosophy. 

In a report issued before the 
November regents ' meeting, 
Schwartz speculated about these 
differing opinions on the budget. 
"Perhaps. to seasoned adlllini~tra­
tor , sayi ng I had a different 'phi-
losophy' oradifferent wayof'bal-

nique for di sposing of alternative 
proposals without having to de-

Fifth College Narrows Its Search for a Name to Five 
By Philip Michaels 
News Editor 

If all goes according to plan, 
Fifth College, which has been 
nameless since its founding in 
1988, could adopt a new name by 
Spring Quarter. . 

While no official time line has 
been set, Fifth College Provost 
James Lyon wants to complete the 
renaming process before the end 
of this academic year, according 
to acting Provost David Ringrose. 
Selecting a name by Spring Quar-
ter would be ideal so that graduat-
ing seniors could have the new 
name on their diplomas, he added. 

After a two-year search pro-

cess, the college has narrowed 
down its choices to a short list of 
five candidates - all of them 
women. Ringrose said that there 
was a strong consensus among 
Fifth College students and admin-
istrators to name the college after 
a woman. 

"If you'look around campus, at 
most we find two buildings named 
after women," said Ringrose, add-
ing that the gender composition of 
Fifth also played a role in focusing 
on women candidates. 

"E ver since [the college] 
opened, for whatever reason, 60 
percent of Fifth College has been 
women," he said, 

Those on the li st are Nobel 
Prize-winning scientist Marie Cu-
rie , Congresswoman Helen 
Gahagan Douglas, aviator Amelia 
Earhart, South African writer 
fIladine Gordimer and humanitar-
ian Eleanor Roosevelt. 

The candidates were selected 
based upon criteria established by 
the college's naming committee. 
The committee called for candi-
dates who would be identitied with 
the college's international focu 
and provide Fifth College students 
with a sense of pride. 

The search for a new name be-
gan two years ago, when the col-

Student Volunteers 
Give Reason for Thanks 
HOUDAY: Thirty-three student groups participate 
in providing dinner and gifts to needy families 
By Mary Beth Sedlack 
Guardian Reporter 

This Thanksgiving, a group of 
UCSD students will be thinking 
about more than just the horren-
dous number of calories they are 
going to consume. Through the 
Volumeer Connection and the 
Adopt-a-Family program, students 
and organizations 
will provide a 
Thanksgiving din-
ner to impover-
ished families. 

Usually, student groups choose 
to provide a Thanksgiving dinner 
for the families. The cost of feed-
ing a family of eight to 10 people is 
about $40. However, the group is 
not restricted to buying just a 
Thanksgiving dinner. "We found 
some families consisted of single 
mothers and their children who 

could use other 
items more, so we 
give people the op-
tion of asking the 
families what they 
need," Schweizer 
said. 

Skyline, a 

To participate, 
interested students 
filled out applica-
tions and submit-
ted them to the Vol-

that encourages

needs. The group may provide a 
dinner, material needs, or both. It 
can deliver the items to their fam-
ily personally or remain anony-
mous. 

''This year we had a very good 
turnout," said Volunteer 
Connection's Director of Special 
Projects Aaron Schweizer, who 
added that 33 groups are taking 
part. This is the third year that the 
UCSD Volunteer Connection has 
participated with the Neighbor-
hood House in the Adopt-a-Fam-
ily program. 

The VolumeerConnection aims 
its recruitment efforts at cl ubs and 
organized groups, but any indi-
vidual can participate. "We try to 
reach groups and organizations 
because it lessens the financial 
burden of this activity," said 
Schweizer. " However, anybody 
can do it, whether they are an 
individual or a group of individu-
als. Some students have joined 
together to participate." 

"The staff at Neighborhood 
House knows most of the families 
because they come in for services 
and emergency food," said Betty 
Juarez, who is in charge of this 
event at Neighborhood House. 

Rajagopalan, who participated in 
the Adopt-a-Family program last 
year. 

Rajagopalan, a resident advi-
sor at Warren College, heard about 
the program when she worked at 
the Volunteer Connection last year. 
This year, she broached the topic 
to the residence life staff at War-
ren and then convinced some of 
her apartments to participate. 

Fifth College senior Christine 
McClosky, who is a member of 
the Skyline group, said that she 
agrees with Rajagopalan. Accord-
ing to McClosky. Skyline was 
looking for something special to 
do for Thanksgiving, when they 
read about the Adopt-a-Family 
program in the Guardial/. 

"It feels like we ' re meeting a 
need. This program makes us 
aware of a need in the cily and 
shows us that you don't have to 
go away from San Diego to find 
that there is a need," McClosky 
said. 

The Volunteer Connection 
doesn't have plans to participate 
in any other Adopt-a-Family pro-
grams this year. However, the 
Neighborhood House will be hav-
ing a food drive for Christmas.

Two Endowed Chairs Established 
Following the approval of the University of Califor-

nia Board of Regents, two endowed chairs in the 
Chemistry Department have been established at UCSD. 

The chairs, known as the Joseph E. Mayer Chair of 
Theoretical Chemistry and the Distinguished Chair in 
Physical Chemistry, have been funded with an endow-
ment of $650,000 from an anonymous donor and 
$50,000 from the chancellor's discretionary funds. 

As envisioned, interest from the endowed chairs 
will be made available to the chairholders to support 
teaching and research in accordance with UCSD policy. 

"This gift has been made by someone of extraordi-
nary generosity and vision, and we are deeply grateful 
for the eXCiting opportunity that it offers our depart-
ment: said Department of Chemistry Chair Ka~a 
Lindenberg. 

"Joseph Mayer epitomizes the excellence that we 
continually strive for, and these appointments will 
bring us closer to our goal,· she added. 

Joseph Mayer, who died in 1983, was one of the 
founders of the UCSD Chemistry Department in 1960 
and served as Its first chairman from 1963 to 1966. 
While at UCSD, he continued his research in the theory 
of statistical mechanics and received several awards, 
including the Peter Debye Award, the James Aack 
Norris Award, the Chandler Medal and the J.G. Kirkwood 
Award. He retired in 1972, but remained active at 
UCSD as a professor emeritus until his death. 

Regents Vote to R ..... I Their 
South Africa Divestment Policy 

At its monthly business meeting, the University of 
California Board of Regents voted on Friday to rescind 
its policy against investing in companies doing bus~ 
ness in South Africa. 

In July 1986, the regents adopted a policy pro-
posed by then-Gov. George Deukmejian that required 
the university to sell its holdings and not make any new 

investments in companies doing business in South 
Africa. 

The regents' action at its meeting in San Francisco 
comes in the wake of a call for reinvestment in South 
Africa. This fall, Nelson Mandela, president of the 
African National Congress, asked for an end to eco-
nomic sanctions against South Africa. 

In response to Mandela's request, approximately 
one-third of all states, local governments, colleges 
and universities have recently repealed their divest-
ment policies. Nearly 30 U.S. companies have re-
entered South Africa. 

Under the university's divestment policy, holdings 
were divested over three years. When the board 
adopted the policy in 1986, the university had $3 
billion worth of investments in 29 companies doing 
business in South Africa. The UC system's total 
portfolio was $9.5 billion. In 1988, when the phased 
divestment program began, 10 of these companies 
remained in the UC's portfolio. The number of compa-
nies was reduced in 1988 and 1989 because of 
companies withdrawing from South Africa and for 
investment reasons, leaving holdings in three compa-
nies that were sold speCifically because of the policy. 

New Math CI ..... to Empha.lze 
thinking Instead of Calculation 

Two new math classes aimed at teaching interest· 
ing and deep mathematical ideas in a down-to-earth 
way will be introduced next quarter. 

Math 17 and 117, "Geometry and the Imagination" 
and "Geometry and the Imagination for Math Majors: 
will be taught next quarter by Peter Doyle, Frederic 
Bien and Michael Freedman. Doyle said the class was 
very successful when he first taught it at Princeton. 

The course, designed to teach what math is really 
about, concentrates on writing, thinking and discus· 
sion instead of the usual lecture-calculation format.

After several scheduling con-
flicts and problems with other 
sponsors backing out, SLS finally 
went ahead with the workshop. 

SLS decided to implement these 
series of planned forums workshops because of budgets cuts 

and a desire to expand its services,

Roxanne Pompilio. She said that 
many of the students who come to 
their office have questions about 
the same issues, such as landlord! 
tenant legalities, women's issues 
and traffic . These workshops are 
held to inform students of their

in order to put together an infra-
structure for future workshops." 
Valladolid said, adding that the 
scheduling of this workshop so 
late in the quarter when students 
are studying for midterms and ti -
nals may have led to the sparse 
attendance.

A forum on hate crimes spon-
sored by Student Legal Services 
(SLS) was cut short last Thursday 
because of sparse attendance. The 
first in a series of workshops 
planned by SLS to address student 
issues, the forum was to feature 
speakers from the San Diego Hu-
man Relations Committee, the Dis-
trict Attorney's office's Outreach 
Program on Hate Crimes and the 
San Diego Police Department

While Alva did not specify what 
the philosophy ofthe regents was, 
Schwartz claims that it can be seen 
in the university's budget proposal. 
"All [of these) short-term steps 
accumulate into self-destructive 
policies," Schwartz said. He added 
that efforts are being made to de-
mocratize the regents, because 
"[The regents are) remote from 
the actual educational enterprises 
of the campus."

will be the last meeting outside of 
San Francisco for several years. He 
encouraged concerned Southern 
Californians to attend that meeting

with legal matters. 

Valladolid said that although 
attendence was low, he feels that

T ~e A.me~can eco~omy is SU~h a ~exible entity that it's possible for u to use It to Justify anythmg. Case 10 pOint: the recent backlash against undocu-mented immigrants. As the state of the economy declines, more severe 
measures are being taken to keep immigrants from entering the United 

States and "stealing" needed jobs. 
It's easy to cloak nativist sentiment in liberal clothing when your arguments center 

around the economy. Claims about the problems of the Americ~ economy and the 
exacerbation of these problems th rough the monopolization of labor by illegal immi-
grants are common (and successful) ways of tuming the focus toward the concrete 
economic facts and finding the first avai lable culprit. 

When you want to think you' re being liberal about the issue. you say you really don't 
mind if immigrants are here. but "damn it, there just isn't enough to go around." People 
like easily solvable issues. and looking at the immigrant issue from an economic 
viewpoint help in this regard. It becomes much easier to tackle: someone to blame. a 
problem to eradicate, a way to eradicate it. With the crisis of the working class gaining 
urgency and the growing influx of surplus labor, thi viewpoint faci litates the justification 
of "drastic" - actually harsh and discriminatory - legislation.

COM MEN TAR Y: The influx ofimmigr(JJlbj places a massive 
burden on states - refonn is essential to avoid fiscal crises and 
intensified xenophobic reaction 

IY DAN HATTIS, ITAFF WRITER 

If the current level of immigration, both legal and illegal, is not abated, the backJash against immigrants will only grow perilously stronger. Immigration into California has exploded since the '80s, causing a visible demographic remaking of the state 
- currently 22 percent of our state' s population is foreign-born. Meanwhile, 

Califomia's economic downturn and the recession-induced strains on state and local 
budgets have made the pUblic more weary of paying the costs of government welfare 
services for immigrants, especially illegal ones. These trends cannot continue without 
calamitous results. Ultimately, we must impose at least moderate restrictions on immigra-
tion if we are to avoid precipitating an explosive negative reaction of crisis proponions. 

Before I'm accused of xenophobia and nativism, allow me to clarify my argument. 
[' m nOl saying that immigration is a bad thing in itself - after all, most of us are 
descendents of immigrants. Rather, the problem is the scope and demographics of the 
cvrrent wave of immigration.

JOHNSON: 
Anti-immigration 
backlash based on 
fear, prejudice 
Continued from p", 4 

For example, extending the U.S.-
Mexican border wall 450 feet into the 
Pacific Ocean was a rash and insult-
ing move on the pan of the United 
States. Yet when people are made to 
feel acertain hysteria about the lack of 
resource distribution. this typeofthing 
is seen not as rash but as necessary. 
Give us your tired. your hungry and 
your poor, but not now. anddon't ask 
us for anything either, 

These arguments fail to address a 
variety of opposing issues. For one, 
the United States is one of the major 
push-factors in Mexican immigration. 
Exploitation of labor and resources 
by the United States in Mexico is not 
just a problem of the past.lt continues 
to happen as U.S. companies employ 
labor for criminal wages and ignore 
human rights. People living in spider 
holes, walking hours to get (0 work. 
and returning from the whole endeavor 
with little more than they left with is a 
common situation. Further, by its very 
economic nature, the United States

Especially striking is the dispro-
portionate concentration of the cur-
rent wave of immigration in a few 
states and localities. Forced to inte-

perpetually seeks to usurp power and 
resources from other, less-developed 
countries. The abuse of American 
power in Mexico (and other coun-
tries) is one of the primary causes of 
the breakdown of indigenous access 
to their own resources. 

Economic reasons aside, people 
continue to flood this country seeking 
political asylum. Anotherfactorwhich 
many anti-immigrationists fail to ac-
knowledge is that the United States 
continues to be one of the key perpe-
trators of political crimes in other 
countries. The murder of thousands of 
Central Americans during the 19805, 
for example, wasprimarily at the hands 
of death squads financially supponed 
by the United States. Our involve-
ment in genocide moves victims of 
political persecution to seek better 
lives, and with the self-indulgent ad-
vertising that the United States is the 
leaderin democracy and human rights, 
there's little wonder why they come 
here. To be sure, given our 
responsiblity, we should feel morally 
obligated to provide these people with 
one of the most basic (and threatened) 
of human rights: life. 

Why opponents of immigration 
often fail to address this side of the 
issue is understandable. No one likes 
to acknowledge that acountry' s great-

grate immigrants, the affected local 
governments are facing extreme fi-
nancial crises. As journalist Ronald 
Brownstein points out, the problem is 
that "the federal government, which 
receives thebulkofirnmigrants' taxes, 
does not provide enough money to 
help the relative handful of localities 
that bear most of the cost of assimilat-
ing the newcomers." 

The UCSD Guardian 

ness comes from its ability to exploit 
and confuse people. NAFTA prom-
ises that U.S. businesses will be able 
to hire more American workers a~ a 

. result of the expansion of the market. 
Yetthe thrustofNAFfA points to an 
extension of the exploitation of labor 
in Mexico. And while most corpora-
tions say they have no interest in 
moving their plants south of the bor-
der. when have we known a U.S. 
corporation to expand and still benefit 
the average worker? Why do we not 
place full concentration of the oppor-
tunities for labor in the current market 
here? 

Of course the arguments for and 
against NAFf A are much more com-
plex. Yet, as we hold accountable and 
persecute immigrants from the south 
(many are the targets of hate crimes 
on a dai Iy basis) we cannot ignore the 
major role of the United States as an 
influence in their immigration to this 

Every year, the nation absorbs well 
over one million immigrants. two-
thirds of which arrive and settle le-
gally. Seventy-five percent of these 
new arrival , however, are concen-
trated in only seven states. At the top 
of this list, of course, is Cali fomia -
during the '80s. nearly 25 percent of 
all immigrants senled here. This sim-
ply isn't fai r. A mere handful of tates 

country . 
Our hysteria has led us to diston 

the truth . Most claim that illegal im-
migrants are stealing funds through 
welfare and other "benefits" for the 
poor. Yet. by law, they are barred 
from receiving welfare and a range of 
other benefits, including food stamps 
and unemployment checks. In addi-
tion, less than 10 percent of those 
suspected of illegally crossing the 
border each year actually become a 
permanent pan of our population. 

Another issue which many refuse 
to acknowledge is the number of ille-
gal immigrants who come here from 
European countries. Even though the 
majority of immigrants come from 
south of our border, when we apply 
such lethal focus to this particular 
group - Mexican and Latino immi-
grants - we encourage racist out-
comes. Who is getting in and who is 
being kept out? More impOitantly, 
why is thereadiscrepancy in responl.e'? 

Between 1981 and 1986. the fed-
eral government deported nearl y 
18.000 Salvadorans, granting only 598 
of them permanent resident St:ltus. 
Meanwhile, half of the Poles who 
applied were granted asylum. 

Theearly 1900s marked the influx 
of many European immigrants. hish 
and Italian immigrants were often the

HArTIS: Legal 
immigration is 
largest problem 
facing states 
ContInued from pap 6 
balance the county budget, wi II force 
the Medical Center to absorb these 
costs itself, as they are morally and 
legally obligated to serve illegal im-
migrants. 

Ortake the issue of providing pub-
lic education for the children ofimmi-
grants, who are overoordening our 
schools and causing a financial crisis 
of massive proportions. Due prima-
rily to the influx of immigrants -
both legal and illegal - California 
school enrollment is projected to grow 
by more than one million this decade. 
And the money needed to accommo-
date them quite simply isn't there. 
Most of the taxes that immigrants pay 
go to the federal government, not the 
state. Meanwhile, schools are forced 
to do more wi th less as class size 
continues to grow. It' s important to 
note that the other states with high 
rates of immigration face similar cri-
ses in school finance. 

Such financial problems posed by 
immigration are feeding the current 
popu lar backlash again t immigrants. 
As a recent Los Angeles Times poll 
showed, the issue of providing wel-
fare and government services to im-
migrants - especially iIIegals - is 
what makes Californians most resent-
ful. Thus witness the favorable public 
response to Gov. Pete Wilson's pro-
posals to cut public services to illegal 
immigrants. 

The sheer number of immigrants 
sealing in California and altering its 
demographic landscape is also feed-
ing public hostility. The majority of 
these immigrants corne from a single 
source - Mexico. As Brownstein 
points out, this appears to be exacer-
bating fears among many of the 
"Balkanization" of American cu Iture. 

Contrary to popular 
belief - and the 
rhetoric of politi-
cians - Ie .. than 
on.thlrd of the 
Immigrants that 
burden our system 
are megal. 
Already. Latinos make up 40 percent 
of the population of Lo Angeles 
County and are projected to make up 
a majority by 2007. In California as a 
whole,28 percent of the population is 
Latino, and is projected to be a major-
ity by 2047. As of today, 20 percent of 
California's school children do not 
speak English. This dramatic change 
of demographics in such a short pe-
riod of time not only raises the threat 
of a real financial crisis, but also of 
exacerbation of xenophobia and the 
possibility of racial violence. 

There is a two-part solution which 
must be pur ued if we are to amelio-

~te this problem. First, the federal 
government must reduce the number 
of immigrants that it legally admits. 
Contrary to popular belief - and the 
rhetoric of politicians - less than 
one-third of the immigrants burden-
ing our system are actually illegal. 
Most of the problems we face today 
re ult from legal immigration. We 
can thank members of Congress for 
this - it was they who misguidedly 
approved the 1990 Immigration Act

which raised legal immigration quo-
tas to 40%. As such. the tim step to 
reform is a rollbackofthese increa.~s, 
and possibly even a further reduction 
of quotas. 

[n terms of illegal immigration, 
which is a relatively small but none-
tht!less real part of the problem, it is 
uncertain whether tighter policing of 
the border wi II actually help or nOl. In 
the long lerm, NAfTA may provide 
an answer. As Me)(ico continues to 
develop, the necessary structural 
changes - more and higher-paid 
employment - will hopefully occur, 
keeping Mexicans from emigrating 
into the more lucrative U.S. labor 
marker. 

S::cond, the federal government 
musl give federal aid 10 the handful of 
states and local government that are 
absorbing the largest number of im-
migrants, legal and illegal. As the 
UCSD Medical Center tiasco and the 
cri sis in school finance demonstrate, 
state and local govemments sin lply 
cannO! afford to shoulder the co. ts of 
assimilation alone-Uncle Sam must 
pay his fair share . After all, the federal 
govemment istheone that determines 
border policy, and it mu t be willing 
to accept and pay forthe consequences 
of that policy. 

Ul timately, the risk i that if we fail 
to enact a reasonable and equitable 
policy of regu lalion today. we may 
face an explosive and violently racist 
reaction later. As historian John 
Higham points out, there i powerful 
historical precedent for thi . "We are 
now," he ays, "at the same point that 
things were at in 1912 with regard to 
the earli er wave of immigration. If 
Congress had acted early, it would 
have defused the pressure. But in-
stead of getting a mtional and equi-
table policy of regUlation, what we 
finally gotwasa racist and demeaning 
policy."Wecanonlyhopethattoday's 
Congress takes note so that Santayana 
isn't proven dreadfully right once 
again.

REGENTS: 
Board approves 
1994-95 budget 
ContInued from pace 1 
ries lag behind the national aver-
age by about 20 percent. 

UC Vice President of Health 
Affairs Cornelius Hopper said he 
fears that if the university loses 
some of its top executives, the UC 
will not be able to compete for 
new candidates. 

''The pool of people who are 
good [executives] is a relatively 
small pool," he said. "If we lose 
our experienced executives. that 
national market is the pool we'll 
have to go to." 

Several regents, however, said 
they feared the decision would 
bring on a public backlash similar 
to the one last year following a 
hefty retirement package for 
former UC President David 
Gardner. 

"It's going to be a David 
Gardner all over again," Campbell 
said. "First you get the hospital 
salaries up, then you get the presi-
dent, then after a while you get a 
real happy executive group, but 
nobody likes them." 

UCSD Medical Center Direc-
tor Michael Stringer will receive 
an 11 percent boost in pay, raising 
his compensation from $162,300 
to $181,200 next year. By 1995. 
Stringer will receive a salary of 
$200,000. Three other UCSD ad-
ministrators are due for raises as a 
result of the regents' action.

lege circulated questionnaires to 

tile BudCet 
On Friday, the regents voteato 

approve the proposed S I .9 biUion 
budget for the UC system. The 
approved budget will now be for-
warded to Gov. Pete Wilson. who 
will announce his proposed state 
budget in January. 

"This proposed budget would 
neither recoup past losses nor im-
prove our situation," said UC Presi-
dent Jack Peltason. "Essentially, 
it would prevent future erosion in 
quality and help maintain access 
to the university." 

The budget proposal, which 
calls for an eight percent or $142 
million increase, would be the first 
increase in state funding for the 
university in four years. 

Preliminary signs indicate that 
Wilson has projected a budget in-
crease of over three percent for the 
UC system. To meet the shortfall 
between the governor's proposal 
and the UC's needs, Peltason pro-
posed a fee increase of $600 to 
$650 to fund faculty merit in-
creases. 

"We will do everything we can 
to persuade the Department of Fi-
nance and the governor to meet 
our full needs - but the prospects 
are not encouraging. It continues 
to appear that we will need a fee 
increase to help fund the budget," 
said UC Senior Vice President 
Walter Massey. 
Fee Concerns 

During Thursday's meeting, 12 
students participated in aone-hour 
open forum in which they voiced 
their concerns over the proposed 

students and staff, asking for new 
name suggestions. From there, the 
naming committee heard reports 
on potential candidates and held 
several college town meetings to 
discuss the issue. 

According to Ringrose, the re-

The UCSD Guardian 

$600. fee hike to the regents. 
While all of the students con-

ceded that some fee hikes were 
necessary, most of them agreed 
that the entire university commu-
nity should shoulder similar in-
creases. 

"It is clear that the UC system 
has forced students and parents to 
shoulder an unfair burden," said 
Natalie Lera, chairofUCBerkeley' s 
Committee for Student Fees. 

"The budget crisis isn't just a 
student, regent or faculty prob-
lem." she added. " If everyone gi ves 
a little bit, the problem can ·be 
solved." 

Anothercommon threadofcon-
cern among the student speakers 
was the issue of financial aid. 

"The financial aid system is not 
servihg our needs," said Univer-
sity of California Student Asso-
ciation (UCSA) member Aaron 
Jones. "There needs to be a long-
term commitment with the state to 
reevaluate financial aid." 

Student Regent Darby 
Morrisroeagreed, saying she fears 
that the board does not take finan-
cial aid seriously enough. 

She cited the 1994-95 budget, 
saying that while the plan consid-
ers fee hikes, it makes no mention 
of financial aid increases. 

"A high-fee, high-aid program 
will not work because it overlooks 
the current financial aid system 
that isn't working," Morrisroe said. 
" I don ' t see an institutional com-
mitment to financial aid."

The UCSD CUIl'flian 

THE SUSPECTS QUICKLY DRIVE AWIIY from the scene of the crime, oblivious to the alert eyes that track them from the shadows. 
Quickly and silently, UCSD Police Officer 
Eddie Shinn shifts his vehicle into gear and 
tears around the comer in pursuit. The 
hapless violators speed down Old Miramar 
Road toward the Warren College apru1-
menlS, thinking that their crime has gone 
unnoticed. However, their delusions of 
success come to a speedy halt as they see 
police lights flashing in their rear-view 
mirror. They pull over, and one of the 
young perpetrators hangs his head in de-
spair as Officer Shinn, flashlight drawn, 
approaches the vehicle. 

"Sorry, Officer. We were in a hurry to 
get home because we 

ENFORCEMENT: Handing have to take some-
thing out ofthe oven," 

out speeding tickets, 

patrolling the roads and 

making the campus safe -

it's just another night on the 
job for the UCSD Police 

said one of the two 
embarrassed Warren 
College students. 

"That was a good 
one," laughs Shinn 
later, "so I gave them 
a warning." 

The driver's vio· 
lations included 
speeding and rolling 
through two stop 
signs, hardly the mis· 
deeds of hardened 

criminals. But Shinn 's job, he explains, is 
to make the campus a safer place, and 
perhaps his warnings can further this cause. 

It is Friday evening, and Officer Shinn 
is on the "swing shift" patrol at UCSD. He 
drives around campus, up to Nobel Drive 
in University City and down to Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, keeping an 
eye on the persons and property of the 

UCSD community and listening for calls 
on his radio. There are always at least two 
officers on patrol at any given time. 

On quiet nights,like tonight, Shinn may 
only give out a few traffic warnings. If 
events like dances and concerts are qcing 
held on campus, there may be more "activ-
ity." Such is the routine of a UCSD police 
ofticer, and Shinn preferS the relatively 
peaceful campus duty. "J like working here, 
there's more interaction with the public," 
says Shinn. "I listen to the SDPD traffic, 
and they're just going from call to call. 

"There's not as much activity as the 
[San Diego Police Department] might 
have," he explains as we drive by Pepper 
Canyon apartments. "We call it the rule of 
four. What an SDPD officer sees in one 
week, we see in four. 

officers spent 20 minutes crouched in the 
shadows while the man pounded repeat-
edly on the bike machinery. 

College campuses also attract transient 
elements who see the large population of 
students as a perfect setting for their ex-
ploits. "I can remember my first arrest," 
says Shinn, "It was a nude male running 
through Galbraith Hall." 

Campus police are not immune to all 
types of job -related hardships. Bi(;ycle en-
forcement duty is often a thankless task. 
"There are other things I'd rather be doi ng 
than standing on the Revelle broadway and 
stopping bicyclists," says Shinn, "Numer-
ous times when I've stopped someone, 
people pass by and say 'get a real job' and 
'why are you hassling him.' We ' re only 

out there for safety." 
There's not as much vio-
lent crime here. Most of 
our crime reports are prop-
erty theft." 

GUARDIAN 
It may be a thankless 

task to some. but Shinn 
prefers bike patrol. A bi-
cycle, he claims, is less 
intimidating than a patrol A car alarm sounds in 

the Pepper Canyon parking 
lot, and Shinn stops talking 

FEHTlIHES 
as he shifts his eyes atten-
tively to the rows of cars. "In the lpolice] 
academy, they teach you to pay attention to 
everything," he says, "but it's a pretty tax-
i ng thing to try to do." 

Car theft is an ongoing problem at 
UCSD, and despite a good vehicle recov-
ery rate, catching the thieves in the act is 
difficult and tedious. "We like to wait and 
arrest them right after they steal things so 
they at least spend a few days in jail," says 
Shinn. 

He remembers a time when he hid in a 
north cam pus parki ng lot wi th several other 
officers, waiting for a thief to try to steal a 
motorcycle. But the thief could not get the 
motorcycle started, and Shinn and the other 

car, and he can interact 
more with students . 
Crooks are also less likely 

to notice an approaching officer who is 
mounted on a bicycle. 

At 5 p.m., we roll into the Coast student 
apartments on La Jolla Scenic Drive. Shinn 
gets a call from the dispatcher about an 
a'larm setoffin the Urey Hall machine shop. 
"615," responds Shinn - indicating his 
officer identification number. We quickly 
leave the sunset view and driveto Urey Hall 
where Shinn meets another officer. 

Beforeexiting his vehicle, Shinn attaches 
his radio ear set, his "slavery to the radio," 
as he calls it. The two officers search and 
secure the empty machine shop. 

"You never know," he cautions. "one of 
these searches might be the real one." Has it 

ever been" '" can't recall." As always, he 
makes a record of the alurm response in his 
log. Anything Shinn does, from filling the 
curwithgas tocheckingacaralarm,l11ust be 
accompanied with a log entry and a radio 
call. "Standard oper-
uting procedure," 
Shinn sighs. 

The swing shift al-
lows an ofticer to set 
his or her own sched-
ule and perform what-
ever acti vity seems fit 
for that particular 
evening. At 5:45 p.m., 
Shinn decides to try 
some stop-signmoni-
toring. We pull up on 
a curve and Shinn 
turns off the lights. 

"The depart ment 
here doesn't stress sta-
tistics," says Shinn as 
he watches cars - some (;om ing to more 
complete stops than others - move through 
the intersection . 

Despi te this, UCSD police officers of-
ten hear negative comme nts from irate 
traffic offenders such as, "Oh, you gotW 
get your quota, huh?" Shinn says that he 
usually responds to this type of comment 
with, "No, I can write as many as I wilnt." 

A Parking Services truck drives through 
the intersection. Shinn has never pulled 
over a Parking Services officer. but notes 
that many police officers have received 
parking tickets on campus. Even cops are 
not above the parking regulations, it seems. 

"Thilt's one job I wouldn't want -
parking," says Shinn. "I can give a guy a 
ticket for speeding. rolling through a stop 
sign. and he's cal m. But if a guy gets a 
parking ticket, he goes ballistic ."

Contrary to popular belief,

HUSKER: 
College football is in 
dire need of a playoff 
Continued from page 20 
On Jan. I every year, Nebraska 
brings its inflated record and over-
rated team to a bowl game, only to 
get the tar beaten out of it by its 
opponent. You can just about set 
your watch to the carnage. 

Theotheruniversal truth is some-
thing most knowledgeable people 
have figured out long ago - bowl 
games suck weasel eggs. They al-
ways have. They always will. Any-
one who salivates in anticipation of 
the Sheer Pantyhose Kumquat Bowl 
or the Midas Muffler Dandelion 
Cia sic needs to seek medical help 
immediately. 

College football is the only sport 
in which the champion is determined 
not on the playing field, but in the 
voti ng booth. Well, I guess boxing 
is too, and we all know how repu-
table the boxing world is. 

If co llege football wants to re-
main credible, it needs a champion-
ship playoff, and it needs it now. 
Take the abominable Weiser Lock 
Copper Bowl and its equally hateful 

bowl brethren behind the bam and 
put the thrice-damned things out of 
their misery. No one, save for a 
couple of bowl game sponsors in 
extremely ugly sports coats, really 
cares about that anymore. 

This year a playoff could feature 
Notre Dame, Florida State, West 
Virginia, Miami, Ohio State, Ala-
bama and UCLA. Hell, invite Ne· 
braska if you want a good chuckle. 
Finall y, the national champion 
would be decided by players rather 
than by pudgy sportswriters and 
embittered coaches. 

But don' t look for the NCAA [0 
do the right thing anytime soon. 
Recently, it shot down the Disney 
corporation's multi-million dollar 
proposal to fund a national champi-
onship contest between the number-
one and two ranked teams. Maybe 
NCAA officials didn ' t want to be 
paid in Disney dollars. Maybe they 
disapproved ofEuro Disney. Maybe 
they fe lt slighted by Mickey, Donald 
and all their pals. 

And so the national playoff is 
dead for the moment. Unti l it' s re-
vived, we can all look forward to 
the big North Texas-Utah confron-
tation in the Listerine Anti septic 
Mint Bowl.

Tritons Sluggish in Opener 
MEN'S BASKETBALL: Sagehens slow down UCSD's revamped, high-speed 
offense and exploit holes in new trapping defense en route to an 89-66 victory 
By Or.,. Wrenn 
Senior Staff Writer 

It was amugh debut for the UCSD 
men 's basketball team's new look 
on Friday night. Playing their sea-

son-opener in 
front of a 
packed house. 
the Tritons 
stumbled 
theirwaytoan 
S9-68 loss at 
the hands of 
Pomona -
Pitzer. 

UCSD 
Head Coach 
Tom Marshall 
and his staff 
had drawn up 

elaborate new battle plans designed 
to take advantage of the team's speed 
and quickness. But no amount of 
speedand-quickness will save UCSD 
when it shoots 31 percent from the 
floor. 

The game was close throughout 
the first half, mainly because nei-
ther team could score. Kareem 
Matthews gave UCSD its first big 
play with seven-and-a-~alf minutes 
gone in the game. The junior nailed 
a shot from the right side, got the 
foul and converted the free throw to 
put UCSD up, 9-7. 

Two minutes later Triton point 
guard Rodney Lusain slashed into 
the left side of the lane and dished 
off to teammate Matt Minnehan, 
who laid it up to give UCSD a 13-7 
lead. 

The Tritons were outscored 11 -4 
in the next three-and-a-half min-
utes, however, and suddenly found 
themsel ves down IS-17 after 
Pomona's Brad Kirkpatrick sank an 
eight-foot turnaround jumper. 

Lusain quickly put the Tritons 
back in front, dropping two three-
pointers within an IS-second span 
and giving the Tritons a 23-20 lead 
with 6:25 to play in the half. 

But UCSD's full -court pressure 
defense had some holes in it, and the 
Sagehens were quick to exploit the 
opportunities, scoring on several 
breakaways and backdoor lay-ups. 

Pomona-Pitzer crawled ahead 
and Kirkpatrick extended the 
visitor'S lead to 36-27 on a right-
side drive with 2: 15 10 play before 
intennission. 

Lusain finished the scoring in 
the half with another three-pointer 
30 seconds later to bring UCSD 

Todd Benatar and the Tritons shot only 31 percent aganist Pomona.

With only a six-point deficit to Marshall said. "But looking at the

Triton Youngsters Finish Strongly in Iowa 
NAnONALS: J.1. Castner, Karen Hinkle lead men's and women's cross-country teams to 14th and 11th place finishes, respectively 
By Jeff Praught 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's and women's cross-
country teams recorded yet another stellar 
performance Saturday, bauling a supreme field 

of competition in the 
NCAA Nationals at 
Oakland Acres Golf 
Course in Grinnell, 
Iowa. 

Despite windy 
conditions, the Triton 
men crossed the line 
in 14th place, while

points) promptly blew away CMS (431

Once again, sophomore J.J . Castner led 
the men's parade. Castner hoped to qualify 
for All-Americun stutus, but his time of25 :47 
(33rd overull ) wasn't quite good enough. 
Nonetheless, UCSD Heud Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale believes that he is almost a ci nch to 
make it next yeur, calling him a "top-15 cun-
didate."

On the whole, Van Arsdale aid he was

The Triton women also shone brightly.

(2:02.67), along with senior John 
Flowers, who finished third in the 
50-free (21.72) und second in the 
I DO-free (48.32), again provided the 
punch to the Triton ~coring offen-
sive. 

The two teamed up with Andrew 
Hollywood and Chris Jugard for a 
second-pluce tully in the 200-med-
ley relay (I :38.68). 

"Our medley relay was pretty 
quick," Boyd said. "I was 'urprised 
how we did there so early in the 
year." 

( I :02.63» for turning out quality 
performances early on. 

"Our brea~tstrr)kers are swi m-
ming fa~ter now than they usually 
do in February:' Boyd said. 

Adam Burgasser and John 
Cuniss dove well against the top 
Stanford competition. Burgasser 
was third in the one-meter (161 .65) 
and three-meter events (158.55). 

While the men truveled nonh, 
the women's squad hosted Univer-
sity of San Diego on S<lturday. The 
Tritons crushed their c.:ro~s-town ri-
vals, 150-83. 

Sophomore Carrie Parker, senior 
Allison Dunn, senior Christina 
Galdos and sophomore Luurie Boyd 
staned the meet off with .1 bang, 
destroying the field in the 200-med-
ley reluy (I :57.11). 

Parker crushed the field in her 
specialty, the backstroke, cruising' 
to two firsts in the 100-meter 
( 1:04.75) and 200-meter (2: 17.16). 

Freshman Cybelle Fox looks to 
be a future Triton blazer in the sprint 
freestyle, finishing second in both 
50- and I ~O-free event (26.45 and 
57.67, respectively). 

''The women had some so lid 
swims: ' Boyd said. 

The Triton women 's diversswept 
the overmatched Toreros. Sopho-
more Sheri Takeuchi (245 .85. 
261.97) outscored teammates Kristi 
Young (226.72,261.90) and Julie 
Goldstein (234.15, 255.0) in both 
the one-meter and three- meter com-
petitions, 

Saturday's meet, she crossed the finish line at 
18:46, which was good enough for 43rd place 
overall. 

"The cream always rises to the top:' Van 
Arsdale said. "The great thing about IHink le) 
is that her goal has never been to be the 
number-one girl. She has always been sup-
portive of the other girls because she just 
wants to be as good as she can be:' 

This type of attitude has become conta-
gious, and the rest of the team has put it into 
practice to help improve each other' s times. 
Jessie Therriault ( 19: 17, 94th overall) and 
Laura Peck ( 19:38, 123rd overall ) clearly 
used this fighting spirit on Saturday, teaming 
up to tally personal records. 

"They sure worked well together out there. 
[Therriault] was one of the reaso n~ [Peck] 
finished s(}well, which shows how everyone 
works together on this team:' Van Arsda le 
said. 

Freshman Hilary Fe rreira, battling a co ld, 
finished 87th with a time of 19: II. She ended 
the year with an overa ll illlprovementofthree-
minutes. 

"[Ferreiral handled the pressure like a 
champ," Van Arsdule sa id. "S he never com-
plained about her co ld , and she didn't lei 
any thing distract her out there." 

In her first year of racing , Chandra 
Boydstun continued to make strides by finish-
ing just behind Hinkle. coveri ng the tive-
kilometer race in a personal best lime of 
18:58. 

"Every race they're finding out what their 
capabilities are. They just ran a step above 

. what they've done this year:' Van Arsdale 
added . 

Thi s event should be a prelude to a great 
season next year, according to Van Arsdale, 
who is in hi s second year at UCSD. 

"It was a learning experience for me . I 
came out of National s knowing that I'll have 
to change my strategy next time. We'll be 
right there next year," Van Arsdale said.

CHAMPIONSHIP: UCSD qualifies for NCAAs with 15-13 win over Air Force 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

To absolutely no one's surprise, 
the Triton men's water polo team 
captured its second consecutive 

Western Water 
Polo Associa-
tion (WWPA) 
Conference 
Tournament 
title yesterday 
with a 15- 13 
drowning of 
the Air Force 
Academy Fal-
cons at the 
Wo od l and 
Community 
Swim Center 
in Sacramento. 

UCSD must be experiencing deja 
vu from last year's identical sce-
nario. The WWPA title automati-
cally places UCSD (19-8) into the 
sixth position for next weekend's 
NCAA National Championships in 
Long Beach, where the Tritons will 
again most likely face the Trojans of 
usc. 

"Hopefully, this lime we can get 
past the first round," senior co-cap-
tain Ricky Romero said. 

The top-seeded UCSD squad 
opened the WWPA tournament last 
Friday with another routine 21-4 
pummeling of number-eight seed 
UC Riverside. The Tritons excelled 
in every aspect of their game, de-
spite the fact that they had not played 
since the Oct. 30 home loss to UCLA. 
The long competitive layover did 

linle to slow San DiegD's dominat-
ing counterattack and stifling de-
fense. 

"We waxed Riverside again," 
UCSD Head Coach Denny Harper 
acknow ledged. 

UCSD goalie Dennis Kantanen 
recorded four saves in the contest. 
The freshman Kantanen replaced 
starting Triton goaltender Andy 
Bruce, who along with Trey Best 
was dismissed from the team for the 
rest of the year for breaking team 
policy. 

UCSD's Mike Nalu and Andrew 
Steinheimereach scored five goals, 
while George Hegarty and Marcello 
Guilianotti nailed two goals apiece. 

Senior Sean Kinghorn also made 
his presence known by netting three 
goals. Kinghorn is still recovering 
from a mid-season shoulder injury 
he suffered in the Tritons' only loss 
to Air Force earlier this year. 

Saturday's draw saw the Tritons 
trounce fifth-seed Chaminade 15-6. 
The spotty Chaminade defense 
floundered helplessly when faced 
with the sheer awesomeness of the 
San Diego arsenal. 

"We did not play great," Harper 
said. "But we did what we had todo. 
We had a slow start, but finally got 
it all going." 

Yesterday 'S championship 
matchup pitted last year's title con-
tender and this year's second-seed 
Air Force against the mighty UCSD 
contingent. And like lasl year, the 
Tritons topped the Falcons toqualify 
for the big dance in Long Beach. 

Air Force has a habit of playing 
San Diego clo e in the big games, 
and this go-around proved no dif-
ferent. 

The Falcons jumped out to a 3-0 
advantage in the first period behind 
a powerful two-poi nt shot by sopho-
more Brad Downs. But the Triton 
offense ignited for eight unanswered 
goals, including six in the econd 
quarter. As good as the offense 
looked, the San Diego defense al-
lowed the Falcons to hang around. 
Air Force's Garren Lowe nailed an-
other two-point goal, an impos ible 
three quarter tank shot, in the wan-
ing seconds of the first half to bring 
the tally to 8-5. 

After a strong Falcon third pe-
riod combined with a sometimes 
shoddy Triton defense, Downsagain 
came through with a two-pointer, 
closing the Triton goal gap and pull-
ing the Falcons even at II -I I with 
one quarter to play, 

But UCSD was not to be denied. 
The Tritons' defense finally woke 
up, forCing several key turnovers 
and smothering numero.us Air Force 
attacks. 

The Falcons were outscored 4-2 
in the last seven minutesofthe game, 
giving UCSD WWPA title rights 
and NCAA advancement opportu-
nities. 

Hegal1y finished with six goals. 
Nalu produced five and Kinghorn 
netted three in the victory. Kantanen 
hauled in eight saves in the winning 
effort. Downs paced the Falcons 
with seven goals. 

Stanford Beats Unfazed UCSD 
SWIMMING AND DIVING: Overly-ambitious Tritons swim well but are no 
match for last season's Division I national champion, Stanford, at Palo Alto 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

In what could be considered an 
act of sadistic 
ma soch ism, 

,UCSD swim-
min g coach 
Doug Boyd 
valiantly gath-
ered his men's 
squad on Sat-
urd ay and 
headed nonh 
to Cardinal 
country 
Stanford Car-
dinal country. 

Anyone with any knowledge of 

swimming will, without hesitation. 
identify the Division I national 
champion Cardinal as far and away 
the best swimming program in the 
nation. One had to wonder why 
UCSD, which has habitually played 
second-fiddle to Division III swim-
ming powerhouse Kenyon College 
for the last decade, would want to 
place its head under the Stanford 
swimming guillotine. 

Such trivialties, however, did not 
bother Boyd. "This [meet] was a 
good experience. [don' t really care 
about how we do in dual meets. 
[Scheduling] Stanford was just an 
opportunity to get some good racing 
in. We actually had a better score 

against them than [the nation 's sec-
ond-best men 's team ) Texas did," 
Boyd said. 

UCSD managed to pull off a 189-
85 defeat, compared to the Long-
horns' 160-83 point total earlierthis 
year, behind some strong early sea-
son performances. 

According to Boyd, seniors Ryan 
Chapman and Peter Shi m "were the 
studs of the meet." Chapman fi n-
ished fifth in the IOO-breaststroke 
( I :04.44) and third in the200-breast-
stroke (2: 16.28), Shim was fifth in 
the 400 indi vidual medley (4: 19.70). 

Senior Travis Miller, who ended 
up second in the 1000back (53.90),

Juniata Firestones Tritons at Final Four 
VOLLEYBALL: Juniata's Nicki Firestone smashes 34 kills in 3-1 win over UCSD; RIT surprises San Diego in third-place contest 
By Aron Miller 
Associate Sports Editor 

What appeared to be the per-
fectly planned season for the UCSD 
women' s volleyball team came to a 
cr<!l.hing and somewhat stunning halt 
this past weekend at the 1993 NCAA 
Division III Final Four. The Tri-
tons' dreams of a seventh national 
championship were snatched away 
by hometown favorite Juniata Col-
lege in the semifinals on Friday 
night, 7- IS, IS-9, 15- 11, IS-9 in 
front of 1,29S elated fans in 
Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. 

As the season progressed to the 
Final Four, everything appeared to 
be panning out precisely to UCSD 

Head Coach Doug Dannevik 's lik-
ing. The schedule was packed with 
top-of-the-line challenges, and it 
looked like the Tritons would ben-
efit from the tough competition. 
Entering the playoffs riding an 11-
game winning streak and cruising 
through the first three rounds of the 
NCAAs, Dannevik' s strategic 
schedule-making seemed to be pay-
ing off. 

But nothing could completely 
prepare them for what would stand 

CHAMPS: 
UCSD crowned '93 
Champs in Mass, 
Continued from page 15 
danger that crossed their path. 

''Toward the end, any ball they 
got they just sent into the air and we 
threw it out," senior Chris Romey 
said. "Everyone was a bit tired from 
Saturday's game, but we controlled 
the game. They were decent, but no 
one was that spectacular." 

The crowd' s cheers rang through-
out the second half, but the sisters of 
fate had sealed this one with a kiss. 

" The boys did very well ," 
Armstrong said, "With 4,000 people 
screaming down your ear, Wi lliams 
played out of their skin, The emo-
tions generated (by the crowd] were 
a problem. but if we had scored 
another goal we probably cou Id have 
scored five more. A second goal 
would have killed the game. The 
crowd was going right to the last 
second." 

The crowd was not the only thing 
that plagued the West Coast Tri-
tons. Cold weather and bitter winds 
challenged UCSD throughout the 
Final Four. 

" I went to look at the field at 9: IS 
a.m, and I was paralyzed. It was like 
an ice rink. I didn' t know what we 
were going to do, Fortunately, at 
around II a.m., it thawed out and 
the field was unbelievable, Some-
body was looking after us," 
Armstrong rejoiced. 

Destiny also shined on San Di-
ego in Saturday's semifinal against 

in their way when Juniata stepped 
onto the court. 

Things began positive ly for the 
Tritons (24-1 1) in the first game. 
They grabbed the all -important 
momentum factor early in the match, 
playing a nearly - unbl~mished ini -
tial set. They out-killed the potent 
Juniat:J attack, 22- 16, committing 
only four errors to Juniata's nine, 
and amassed an impressive.400 hit-
ting percentage. UCSD won game 
one, I S-7. 

"The first game was the best we 
played," Dannevik said. 

It was all downhill from there, 
though. The Tritons' opening-set 
win ignited Juniata's offensive fire. 
Leading the attack was Ali-Ameri-
can outside hitter Nicki Firestone, 
who thwarted just about any defen-
sive blocking scheme Dannevik 
could devise and helda virtual clinic 
on how to kill an opponent. 

Dan 

According to Oannevik, 
. Fire tone was the obvious differ-
ence between the two tea ms. 
"[Firestone I is a great luxury as a 
right-side hitter. Thank God ~he's 
gone. I'm proud of our kids. We 
fought hard, but the better team won 
the match," Dannevik said. 

The win advanced Juniata (42-2) 
to the tinals against two-time de-
fending national champion Wash-
ington Uni versity in SI. Louis (44-
2). The Bears won the contest easi ly 
in three sets to captu re thei r third 
straight titl e and fourth in the last 
five years. 

UCSO's setback sent them tothe 
third-place match, where it took on 
Rochester Institute of Technology 
(RJT) , which Washington beat in 
the other semifinal. 

"It was real important for 
[Firestonel to start getting good 
swings at the ball," said Juniata 
Head Coach Larry Bock, 1993's 
American Volleyball Coaches' A s-
sociation (A VCA) Coach of the 
Year. 

Junior Julie Harvey collected 18 digs this weekend at the Anal Four, 

Adding insult to injury, the un-
derdog Ti ge rs (42-8) surpri sed 
UCSD in tive games, 15-3, 15-9, 6-
IS, 13- IS, 15-8, sending the Tritons 
back to La Jolla ufter a thoroughly 
disappointing coup le of days. 

"This weekend, Juniata College 
and the NCAA have been great," 
Dannevik said. " We have enjoyed 
everythi ng and everybody. But, Ull -
fortunately, our level of play didn't 
match the level ofell thusiasm at thi s 
event ." 

Juniata won the second game, 
15-9, reversing its form from game 
one and makingjust four miscues to 
UCSD' s II . The Tritons could only 
muster a dismal .OSO hitting per-
centage in game two. 

The home team took complete 
control of the match during the third 
set, bolting out to an early 4-0 lead. 
San Oiego had difficulty stringing 
together consistent point-scoring, 
mostly because of the strong dig-
ging of Juniata junior Christy 
Orndorff, who finished the contest 
with a hard-fought 23 digs. Bock's 
squad, on the other hand, took ad-

vantage of its sideout opportunities, 
" The siding-out we ~ere getting 

from the middle of the third game 
on, paid off for us in the fourth," 
Bock said. 

Dannevik also saw the tide turn-
ing in luniata's direction. "At 4-0 in 
the third, we were on the run." 

The Tritons mounted shades of a 
comeback in the third game, but 
cou Id not handle Firestone's power-
ful sp ikes. Juniata took a 2-1 lead 
with a 15- 11 win. 

San Diego's collective backs 
were against the wall in game four. 
II was a do-or-die situation for the 
visitors, and Juniata made sure to 
kill the Tritons, The fourth game 
wasn't even close, with the 

Senior Chris Romey scored the winning goal for UCSD against Kenyon. 
top-ranked Kenyon College. over to the other side of the net. 

After Romey' s rifle shot under- Kenyon' s Leigh Sillery intercepted 
neath diving Lords goalie Marshall the pass and then tried to pass the 
Chapin from 12 yards out at 7:29 in ball back to a charging Chapin. The 
the first half, Kenyon's Mark Phillips ball rolled past the helpless Kenyon 
launchedabulletofhisownamere goalie and into the net, giving the 
34 seconds later. Phillips one-timed Tritons the 2- 1 victory. 
a shot from20yardsoutthat bounced "Williams was a wonderful 
off the right post and into the far side place." Armstrong said. "I was proud 
of the net for the equalizer. of the boys, Lhey played extremely

side of the box and tried to cross it the Williams' bench. 

Huntingdon group out-killing 
UCSD 22-13. 

Junior setter Heather Blough 
found a good thing and stuck with it, 
continuing to pass to Firestone, 
whose onslaught of pounding hits 
did the Tritons in. 

All in all, the senior finished with 
an astounding 34 kills in 6S attempts. 
Orndorff turned in a solid offensi ve 
performance to complement her 
steady defense, tallying 16 kills. 
Juniata' s 74 kill s for the match 
helped Blough enjoy a career day as 
well (72 assists). 

Seniors Laura Kranz and Liz 
Vesanovic led the Tritons with 14 
and 13 kills, respectively. Vesanovic 
also dug 21 balls for San Diego. 

The Final Four marj(ed the end 
of an impre sive career for 
Vesanovic, who, in her finalmalch 
as a Triton, pounded 16 kill . She 
consistently led San Diego in kills 
throughout the season and provid.:d 
constant leadership for a young and 
inexperienced Triton squad. She was 
honored by the A VCA a a second-
team All -American. 

Julie Harvey and Kri sti Askeland 
were also named to the Ali-Ameri-
can team.

20 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian Monday. NoVt'lIlbt' l ' 22. 199:i 

PHILIP 

MI[HHELS 
North Texas: 
Bowling for 
Disney Dollars 

Well. So much for the 
inevitable Notre Dame·Florida 
State rematch. 

Maybe the Fighting Iri h 
were suffering a letdown after 
beating the Seminoles last 
week at South Bend. Maybe 
Lou Holtz didn ' t spend enough 
time whining about how tough 
the Boston College Eagles 
were. Maybe the Eagles had to 
sit through one too many 
creenings of "Rudy." But for 

whatever reason, Boston 
College upset Notre Dame 41-
39. And the national champion-
ship picture is about as easy to 
understand as a Don King 
diatribe. Well , maybe not -
King occasionally throws in a 
verb or two. 

To even make sense of the 
bowl picture, we have to use 
that most hateful of sports 
phrases "i f the season were to 
end today." According to the 
Coalition poll that determines 
bowl invitations, if file set/soil 
were fO elld fod.:y, Nebraska 
would play Florida State for 
the national championship in 
the Orange Bowl. But the 
season doesn' t end today, and 
indeed, won't end until the first 
weekend in December. By that 
time, both the Cornhusker and 
the Seminoles may have long 
since choked, leaving someone 
like BYU or East Tennessee 
State to slug it out on New 
Year's Day. 

But even if the season 
doesn't end today, a couple of 
universal truths have become 
apparent. First off, Nebraska 
deserves to be number one like 
Michael Bolton deserves his 
Grammy award. Rather than 
face actual teams like other 
schools feel obliged to, 
Nebraska fattens up on stiffs 
like Texas Tech, North Texas 
and Colorado State. Ah yes, 
North Texas - they've got 
themselves a hell of a program. 
All those bowl appearances. 
All tho e All-Americans. 
Maybe North Texas should be 
number one. 

And Nebraska's recent bowl 
game record is enough to whet 
the appetite of any sports fan. 
The Cornhuskers haven't won 
a bowl game since Ronald 
Reagan was catching his z's in 
the Oval Office six years ago.

NUMBER ONE: UCSD 
wins its third national 
championship with a 
1-0 victory against 
Williams College 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Hours of practice, ceaseless run-
ning, sit-ups, push-ups, twisted ankles, 
bruises, emotional pandemonium - the Tri-
ton men's soccer team experienced it all this 
season. 

The athletes and Head Coach Derek Armstrong 
went through their share of ups and downs, but one 
unifying factor kept their fires burning brightly 
throughout - a shot at the national title. 

On Sunday, Nov. 20, a day that will long be 
remembered by the victorious players and an over-
joyed coach, that dream came to fruition. UCSD (21-
2-1) captured its third NCAA Division III Men' s 
Soccer National Championship, edging out the previ-
ously undefeated host, Williams College, 1-0. 

In the first 10 minutes of the title match, Williams, 
sparked by an estimated home crowd of close to 
4,000, controlled the tempo. But, the UCSD defense, 
which has been the cornerstone of its success this 
season, smothered every threat Williams could mus-
ter. 

Only 23: 16 into the first half, disaster struck the 
New Englanders and UCSD's Ken Fujii wrote 
another page in the NCAA history books. 

"I tackled some guy at midfield," Fujii re-
called. "I remember [ elbowed him and knocked 
him off the ball and took off. There was a lot of 
open space around me. I didn' t expect that, espe-
cially in a championship game. So, [ just dribbled 
toward the goal. 

"I pulled up a bit at the top of the box and there 
was only the sweeper between me and the goalie. I 
stuttered two or three times to see if he would make 
a dive at me, but he didn ' t. 

"I realized that [ was getting too close to the goal 
and I saw lthe sweeperJleaning toward the left. The 
goalie came off hi s line and he was a bit off-balance, 
so I stepped to the right of the sweeper and pushed it 
to the far post. It happened so quick I was just happy 
the ball went in," Fujii ·aid. 

"It was brilliant," Armstrong praised. "It was 
everything you could have wanted from the little 
guy. It was worthy of a championship goal." 

It was the only goal Williams' keeper Erin Sullivan 
would allow, but that was all the Triton defense 
would need. Triton goalkeeper Michae[ Madden and 
the defensive corps of Matt Chilton, Nick Terlecky, 
Ken Bums, Brian Turner and Jay Newcomer turned 
in another outstanding game, clearing every potential

GUARDIAN ATHLETES-OF-THE-WEEK 

Junior ~ Hinkle led the UCSD women's cross-
country team to an 11th-place finish last weekend at the 
Division UI Nationals in Grinnell, Iowa. 

Hink[e finished the five-kilometer race with a personal 
best time of 18:46.2, which gave her a 43rd-place finish 
overall. 

"She's really accepted the understanding of being a 
leader," UCSD Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale said of his 
star runner. "She's always accepted the role and she' s very 
supportive of the other girls." 

Junior forward Ken FuJII scored the d~ciding goal in

the Tritons their third national champion~hip . Fujii got

able goal. It was brilliant. Everything you could expect
