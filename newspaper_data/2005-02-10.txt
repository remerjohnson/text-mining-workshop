By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

enators on the A.S. Council 
voted on Feb. 9 to indefinitely 
table proposed legislation and a 
student referendum to reduce col-
lege council repre entation on the 
campuswide body. Though the 
move neither approves nor reject'. 
the plan, the vote make it unlike-
ly that the propos!!d constJtution-
al changes will come before sru-
ch!m when they vote in April. 

The legi !ation, tahled by a 
vote of 16 to 4, sought to signifi-
cantly reduce the number of col-
lege-based repre entatives on the 
council in exchange for an 
increa cd role by srudent who are 
not connected to their college 
councils. The council voted to 
table the corresponding referen-

Study: Aid to blame 
for rising tuition fees 

Report urges financial aid update 
FAFSA too complicated, group ay 

By MADELINE PHILLIPS 
Contributing Writer 

Federal financial 'lin to college 
students may have contributed to 
the rising college tu ition rates in 
recent years, according to a new 
report publ ished by the Tibertarian 
Cato Institute. 

Written in anticipation of 
Congress' pending reauthorization 
of the IIigher Education Act -
which sets the amount of most fed-
eral aid awarded to college snldents 
- the report was authored by 
Hillsdale College political science 
professor Gary Wolfram. 

Titled "Making College More 
Expensive: The Unintende,' 
Consequences of Federal Tuition 
. id ," the report argues that greater 
university access for low-income 
tudents provided by federal aid 

leads to a higher demand for post-
econdary education, causing a n e 

in ruition prices. However, the 
extent of this inflation is difficult to 
determine due to other factor 
affecting tuition, the report states. 

In fact, federal aid to students 
may decrease support provided by 
state governments and universities 
themselves and may increase gov-
ernment red tape for colleges, 
which must comply with various 
federal regulations to receive feder-
al aid, according to the report. 

"For democracy to work, it is 
important that the instirutions that 
educate those who will participate 
in the democratic system be truly 
independent of the government," 
,,volfram stated in the report.

rudent financial aid adminis-
tered and paid for by the federal 
government must be simplified to 
serve the needs of studen ts, a new 
report from the Department of 
Education's Advisory Committee 
o n Student Financial Aid 
Assistance argues. 

Titled "The Student Aid 
Gauntlet," the report propose an 
overhaul of the financial aid 
process III order to make it more 
accessible to middle- and low-
income students, according to 

ssociation of Ind pendent 
Colleges and Universities III 
iVlassachusetts and committee 
chair Clare Cotton. 

"Congre s commissioned the 
committee to do a one-year study 
of how the student aid process 
might be simplified for low-
income students to navigate 
through the ... proces ," Cotton 
said. 

The report called on Congress 
to make 10 changes to simplify 
fed ral aid. One of the key pro-
posals is to phase out the paper 
version of the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid. Instead, 
the report suggested meamlining 
the financial aid application into a 
fully integrated system on the 
Internet. 

The c mmiltee found that the 
current FAF A applacaoon, which 
include more than 100 que tion5, 
I far too complex, according to its 

sociare taff Director icole 
Barry. 

"Basically, the Department of 
Education has tried to implify 
tlle whole process ... but there arc 
still thing that can be donc," 
Barry said. "There are multiple 
barrier that studen face when 
applying for financial aid . 
IncreaSing grant aid I~ important, 
but Implification of the proces~ 
can make rudent aid more acce~­
sible to many more rudents."

Financial Aid Director heryl L.

report. "I thll1k we talked about 
making the application only a

The report al 0 recommended 
allowing students to apply for 
financial aid earlier.

I BRIEFLY 
Students protest debt on 

state Capitol steps 
Student leaders took their displeasure with 

mounting debt to the Capitol Rotunda in 
Sacramento, Calif., on Feb. 7. In a rally orga-
nized by the UC Students Association, a group 
of approximately 250 students stood beneath 
umbrellas as they threw fake "checks" into the 
air, with the amounts written on the checks 
representing loans they had incurred' during 
their time at the university. 

Dancing and singin~ lilt's Raining Debt' - a 
song composed espeCially for the occasion -
students expressed their displeasure with 
January's budget proposal by Gov. Amold 
Schwarzenegger, which offered limited growth 
for UC funding. 

The group brought more than 5,500 checks 
filled out by students from across the UC sys-
tem, totaling $201.5 million worth of student 
debt, according to a UCSA statement. 

"Student fees rising! Our aid getting low/ 
According to all sources/ Sac-to's the prace to 
go: the students chanted. "Black, brown, white, 
queer/ Absolutely soaked in debt." 

Later In the week, UCSA called on Assembly 
Speaker Fabian Nunez and other state legisla-
tor; to address the gap in access to public high-
er education. 

The group sent out approximately 100 
handWritten letters to targeted lawmakers, urg-
Ing the UC Office of the President to commis-
sion a study looking into school-by-school vari-
ation in offenngs of UC-required preparatory 
courses. 

'All California students deserve a fair shot at 
higher education, especially at their public uni-
versities: Revelle College Senior Senator and 
UCSA organizer Ted McCombs said. "It is unfair 
that thousands of youths who live in our poor-
est communities are practically denied access 
to the UC the first day they step into their high 
schools, unless they have the leisure time to 
take additIOnal courses outside their high 
school. Our legislators need to take action 
Immediately to close this opportunity gap." 

Professors say Social 
Security solutions exist 

Three UC Berkeley economics experts have 
questioned Preslden George W. Bush's assess-
ment that private savings accounts may repre-
sen the best way to fix the country's Social 
Secunty system, 

In questlon-and-answer interviews released 
by he university, some of the professors said 
they disagreed with the dismal assessment of 
the retirement program the president offered 
In hiS State of the Union address last week. 

"It's not something where the sky is falling 
and we can't do anything about it," economics 
professor and Director of UC Berkeley's Burch 
Center on Tax Policy and Public Finance Alan 
Auerbach said. 'We certainly can make no sig-
nificant changes in the Social Security system 
and [still) fix it." 

Instead of Bush's proposal, Auerbach said 
he recommends an approach that combines a 
higher retirement age, reduced benefits and 
higher taxes with a partial privatization scheme. 

However, professor of economics and demo-
graphics Ronald Lee said he disagreed with criti-
cism charging that the Bush administration was 
overestimating the scope of the program. 

"As a demographer and as someone who has 
been calculating and doing projects on Social 
Security finances for quite a number of years, I 
think those criticisms are mistaken," he said. 

Lee stopped short of endorsing a full priva-
tization scheme, however, saying that the chal-
lenges of fixing the program could be 
addressed through 'incremental steps:' 

Economics professor and Nobel laureate 
Daniel McFadden said the prospect of privati-
Btion raised important issues that needed 
consideration by the public. 

'The conservatives say people should be 
free to make their own choices, and that 
sounds good: he said. "But some people are 
going to choose badly, and then the question 
is, 'Vl/nat's everyone going to do, what's the 
society going to do? Are we really prepared to 
deal with people who are living on the streets 
and starving?, 

Seaweed may prevent 'breast 
cancer, researchers find 

Kelp, a type of vegetation often found 
washed ashore on beaches, may decrease the 
risk of estrogen-dependent diseases like breast 
cancer, researchers at UC Berkeley have found. 

In a study published in the Journal of 
Nutrioon, they showed that a seaweed-rich diet 
helped reduce the levels of the potent sex hor-
mone estradiol in rats. 

The outcome may augur similar results for 
humans, scientists have su~ested, pointing to 
a large consumption of kelp In Japan as a pos-
sible explanation for a lower rate of breast can-
cer in Japanese women. 

'This study opens up a new avenue for 
research leading to cancer-preventive agents: 
professor of environmental health and co-
author of he study Martyn Smith stated in a 
university announcement. 

In a separate study of human ovarian cell 
cultures, conducted in collaboration with UC 
Davis, kelp extract led to a 23- to 35-percent 
decrease in estradiol levels, the researchers 
reported.

Vote: Additional referenda 
may ask students for opinions 

Sum'mer: Upcoming session to offer more classes 
continued from page r 

"The senate serves as a hin-
drance to organizing around issues 
that students care about, like fee 
increases," Corrales said. "With 
general representatives, colleges 
shouldn 't matter. Their first 
responsibility would be to the 
whole student body." 

Many members of the council, 
however, opposed the changes. 
Thurgood Marshall College Junior 
Senator Kate Pillon said th~t the 
problems with the current election 
methods were not due to the struc-
ture of the council but to the indi-
vidual senators. 

"We need to look at the way we 
do our jobs before we change who 
does the job," Pillon said. "Right 
now, people do not solicit informa-
tion from their constituent. But 
everyone is represented by class 
and college, regardless of how they 
feel." 

-The proposal would also effec-
tively eliminate the voice of fresh-
men from the council, according to 
Revelle College Senior Senator 
Ted McCombs. 

"This referendum is not appro-
priate because we will completely 
lose the freshman vote, because no 
college is going to have their one 
representative be a freshman," 
McCombs said. 

The legislation also sought to 
give voting right to the three 
A.S. vice presidents and all of the 
various elected commissioners. 
Currently, these positions do not 
include a voting position on the 
council, though executive and 
cOlnmissioner members possess 
much expertise on many of the 
issues it addresses, according to 
Corrales. 

A.S. President Jenn Pae first 
introduced the concept of changing 

the strucrure of the council. In the 
Feb. 2 council meeting, Pae asked 
the members to discuss the possi-
bility of changing the system to 
include twO senators from each col-
lege and 12 members at large who 
would be elected in a university-
wide election. 

Though the legislation and 
corresponding referendum sub-
mitted on Feb. 9 were effectively 
defeated, many members of the 
council said that the structure of 
the council should be changed. 
Some, however, said they could 
cHer better alternatives to the 
proposal. 

"I would recommend an isslle-
based system, which is structured 
around commissions and their 
staffs," McCombs said. "And each 
representative should be working 
on a commission." 

Despite the council's decision 
not to let this legislation come 
before the students, many coun-
cilmembers said that decisions 
affecting the structure of the A.S. 
Council should be addressed by the 
students. 

"Ultimately, the council should 
not be deciding such a large issue," 
Pae said. "The smdents, as a single 
voice, should decided if their repre-
sentative body is representing them 
oroot." 

In its next meeting, the council 
will vote on referenda asking 
whether students voting in the next 
general election feel well repre-
sented by the A.S. Council. In 
addition, the referenda would poll 
student sentiment on whether the 
council should include equal num-
bers of college-based and general 
representatives.

obligation to admit the top 12 
percent of California's graduating 
high school seniors, the campuses 
have faced a problem of accom-
modating rising numbers of these 
students, Appelbaum said. UC 
administrators believed efficiently 
using summer sessions could 
solve such a problem and began a 
government buyout of UC sum-
mer sessions by funneling state 
funds into some campuses over 
the past several years. 

"The state began by buying 
out summer sessions at places 
where expansion of [the) campus 
wasn't possible, like UCLA or 
Berkeley," Appelbaum said. 
"Soon there was a gross inequity 
between UC campuses, so to rec-
oncile that, they agreed in this 
year's budget that some gross dol-
lars would go toward buying out 
the rest of the UC campus sum-

. .. 

mer sessions. 
Previously, summer instruc-

tion at UCSD received no state 
aid and was funded solely by Stu-
dent fees paid during those ses-
sions. However, last fall, the pos-
sibility of receiving immediate 
funds from the state invoked ideas 
of improving and lengthening the 
summer session. 

During a Nov. 3 A.S. Council 
meeting, A.S . PresidentJenn Pac 
discussed the opportunities for 
potential state funding for the 
year, including a I O-week quarter 
similar to the UCSD school year 
and to a session option offered by 
UCLA and UC Berkeley. 

In aJan. 24 interview with the 
Guardial1, UC President Robert 
C. Dynes said a full summer ses-
sion would allow the university 
to expand student access a t a 
lower cost than other alterna-
tives. 

"The interesting thing about 
opening up the summer programs 
is that you're not drawing down in 
the other quarters," he said. "So 
you're not adding a number of 

" The university stiU needs 
time during the summer to 
get the place back in shape 

far regular quarters, "

vice chancellor, undergraduate 

education 

students and depleting the ser-
vices." 

While funding for students 
during the summer would have 
come out of money set aside for 
enrollment growth in the state 
budget, the option would not 
require new facilities, Dynes 
said. 

"We will accommodate the 
additional students by opening 
up another quarter," Dynes said, 
without offering a timeline for 
the expansion. "We won't have to 
build any new buildings to acco-

modate that . ... Sure, it COSts 
more money, but what we don 't 
have to do is huild new f.l ci I i ti cs 
to do this. It doesn 't ~han!-[t: the 
student-tn-faculty ratio, Jlld it 
doe n', delete th ~ quality and th~ 
studcnt services that yo u're 
going to wa nt. " 

UCSD will receive half of tbe 
statc "buyout" this summcr, .1I1e1 
the rest next year. 

Ilowever, time cunsrraint~ will 
not allow the state moncy to be 
used for improvements ' i n the 
2005 summer session, a cordtng 
to Appelbaum. The normal fj"c-
week periods will allow for cam-
pus faculty and staff to prepare 
properly for the academic yeOI' 
ahead , he said. 

"Overall , it will look pretty 
much the same, except there wtl l 
be more courses offered by regu-
hlr-ranked facu lty," he said. "We 
still plan for summer session to be 
done in two blocks. The univer~i­
tv still needs time during the SUfll -
Iner to get the place back in shape 
for regular quarters." 

However, improl'eme nt~ are 
on the way for UCSD summer 
sessions because of future state 
funding, Appelbaum said. 

"/\ student .lttending summer 
session three years from now WIll 
notice things like many mort 
classes, a higher number of faculty 
and extended library hours," he 
said. "We're going to offer a first-

The UCSO Guardian is published lwice a week at the University of California at San Diego. 
Contents <0 2005. Views expressed herein represent the majorily vote of the editorial board and

Guordl(}n staff. 

University must bear 
return--to--aid burden 

A new propo al in the works at the UC Office of the 
Pre ident could fundamen-
tally transform the univer-
sity and dump in the laps of 
srudents a task that is the 
responsibility of the state. 

Under the plan, to be 
put before the regents in 
March, a portion of cam-
pus-based fees like the stu-
dent sdf-assessed con-
truction referenda and 

activity fees would be 
required to cover financial 
aid . Currently, only the 
systemwide tuition fees 
ha ve a rerurn-to-aid com-
ponent. 

The new policy, if 
approved, would drain cof-
fers of srudent governments 
and require srudents to bear 
the burden of paying for 
services the university and 
lawmakers are responsible 
for providing. 

If financial aid accounts 
are depleted, the answer is 
simple: University adminis-

trators must stop approving 
new campus fees. Whether 
they decide to or not, they 
must not go back now and 
demand a slice of the 
money from projects initi-
ated and paid for by the stu-
dents themse lves. 

Of course, the regents 
could always rethink their 
newly approved bud get. 
Despite their intentions to 
send a third of the money 
raised from tuition hikes 
to aid, the regents voted in 
the fa ll to reduce this to 25 
percent for next year's 
increases. At the time, th e 
UC Students Association 
argued that th e amou nt 
would not be suffi cient to 
cover the necessary finan-
cial aid, but both regents 
and administrators dis-
missed the argument. 

Clearly, the current pro-
posal suggests that UCSA 
was correct and that admin-
istrators are attempting to 
raid student governments 
to backfill the gap. 

Transparency is key for 
UC President Dynes 

I n many cases, the "why" of a decision is just as important as the 
"what." The UC Office of 
the President's decision to 
allocate approximately $1 
million in funding to help 
UCSD complete its 
rebuilding of University 
House is one of those 
cases. 

On Jan. 24, UC 
President Robert C. Dynes 
visited campus, and in an 
interview with the Guardian 
expressed his belief tha t 
funding for the $7.2 million 
University House renova-
tion should be raised from 
local sources. While Dynes 
didn't rule out the possibil-
ity that university funds 
would be diverted to the 
project, the about-face can't 
help but raise questions, 
regardless of what one 

thinks about the project's 
worthiness, 

When contacted by the 
Guardian, universi ty 
spokesman Brad Hayward 
would not fully explain why 
the university ca me up 
short on funding, leaving 
supporters and critics alike ~ 
asking the same question. 

There's no question that 
Dynes has been forced to 
make tough decisions and 
at times has received harsh 
criticism for doing just 
that. During his recent 
tour of UC campuses, 
Dynes did a good job giv-
ing the reaso ning behind 
the university's side of var-
ious issues ranging from 
labor practices to enroll-
ment levels. Now he needs 
to step up and show that it 
wasn't a one-time publicity 
stunt.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Teach for America 

redresses inequalities 
Editor: 
"You want to change things." 

My mind toyed with the state-
ment, and I took the Teach For 
America flyer from the bulletin 
board, tucking it in my planner. 
At home, I logged on to 
http://www.ttochforammco.org and 
realized that I had four more years 
before I could join the movement 
toward educational equity as a 
corps member. [ was a freshman 
then - a budding idealist, keen to 
fight the social inequalities our 
country face . 

Now a senior at UCSD, J fin d 
myself considering the question 
that many of us are facing: What 
will I do next year? Friends are 
receiving job offers, and I find 
myself in the midst of applica-
tions, trying to figure our what I 
am to do with my life. I've done 
the 9-to-5 office job, and know 
there must be more - something 
challenging and rigorous that will 
keep me excited to go to work. I 
know that I want to change 
things. 

In the fall of 1988, Wendy 
Kapp had that same idea. 
Working on her senior thesis, 
Wendy laid plans for Teach For 
America. Upon graduation from 
Princeton University, she and 
other recent graduates rallied 500 
accomplished peers to commit 
two years to teach in urban and 
rural public schools. After the 
commitment, these corps mem-

bers would take the insight gained 
through the experience to effect 
long-term change through every 
sector. Today, 12,000 individuals 
have joined the corps. 

As we consider our next steps, 
this is an opportunity to take on 
important responsibiliti es and 
have a meaningful impact. The 
problem that Kopp considered 
sti ll challenges us to take action. 
Today, nine-year-old children 
growing up in low-income com-
munities are, on average, three 
grade levels behind their peers in 
higher-income areas. They rre 
seven times less likely to graduate 
from college. 

I'm inspired to join other 
recent graduates who are commit-
ted to teach for two years in low-

income urban and rural commu-
nities, and who want to become 
life-long advocates for change. 
Noma tter my ul ti mate career 
choice, I will be part of a larger 
movement, working to expand 
educational opportunities for stu-
dents. 

There are 14 UCSD students 
who are in the middle of their first 
year in the classroom with Teach 
For America. On Feb. 10, UCSD 
alumna Rebecca Meyer wi ll recurn 
to ca mpus for a documentary 
screening. In 2002, CNN cameras 
followed four corps members as 
they tra ined and- entered their 
classrooms, working to close the 
achievement gap. I hope you will 
take time to witness what this 
experience can look like in action. 

As June approaches, many of 
us are considering what career 
plans lie ahead. Many of liS are 
also aware of the inequalities 5n1-
dents are facing in low-i ncome 
schools. Looking around ca mpus, 
let us remember why particular 
students have not had an equa l 
opportunity to receive higher 
education at the same level that 
we have. I hope that our graduat-
ing class will be a catalyst to this 
social justice movement, and will 
take on the challenge to have an 
impact on a child 's opportunities.

Good teaching at the 

heart of UCSD 
Editor: 
In an opini on piece last week 

("Research focus neglects under-
grads," Jan. 31), Brian Uig raises 
several important issues relating 
to the quality of undergraduate 
education at UCSD. I applaud his 
concern, because it is only by con-
structive criticism that UCSD will 
continue to improve. Uiga men-
tions several good ways to 
improve education at UCSD. 
They require funding that may 
not be avai lahle in the current 
budget environment, however, so 
let me make two suggestions that 
do not have that difficult require-
ment. 

1. Implement the Boyer Report. 
A few years ago, a national blue-
ribbon panel (the Boyer 
Commission) olltlined a blueprint 
for improving undergraduate edu-
cation at a research un ivc r ity. 
Most importantly, the commission 
highlights the need to give under-
graduates an education in research : 
h, rp:lllIapf r Y. cc.J'lIl1]Jb. rdlll Preslboyer. 
nsf 

One of these suggestions, a cap-
stone research experience during 
the undergraduate years, is mir-
rored in the requirements of inh 
College, for instance. Why aren 't 
all of the Boyer recommendations 
part of the educational fabric here' 

See LmERS, Page 6

T hey were stopped right next to each other at the light. In one lane, a muscular cherry-
red Ferrari, snarling confidently 
with no top and a dazzling glass 
panel that revealed its emblazoned 
engi ne (also cherry-red) under-
neath. In another lane , a battered 
pickup truck - if you could call it 
that - with a blue driver's side 
door, primer-gray cab and pale yel-
low bed, exhaust pipe dangling 
dangerously close to the pavement, 
lawn mowers and leaf blowers piled 
high in the back, tires nearly flat. 

What happened next could be a 
metaphor for economic inequality 
in America. The light nlmed green, 
and tile Ferrari. with all eight glass-
covered cylinders whirling a high 
moan, sped off toward downtown 
La Jolla. The picl'Up truck jolted 
forward with a "kachunk," followed 
immediately by a discouraging 
whirling sound, and the blue-gray-
yellow Datsun was drifting toward 
the middle of the intersection at 114 
mph, its tailpipe scraping loudly on 
the dark asphalt. 

Scenes like this - of extreme 
wealth brushing up again t extreme 
poverty - are not new to the 
American landscape . For the last 20 
rears, the top 5 percent of the pop-
ulation has been soaking up more 
and more of the nation's wealth, 
leaving less and less for the other 95 
percent. In 2003, the average CEO 

~-1 ELECTIONS 2005 
V-i 

made 300 times more than his aver-
age worker, according to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics. From 1983-
1998, the average changc in house-
hold net worth for the poorest 40 
percent of Americans dropped 76 
percent, whi le over the same period, 
the top I percent saw their net 
worth increase by 42 percent. 

The widening rift between the 
nations rich and everyonc else isn't 
the result of chance. It' not an acci-
dent. It is, and has been, the goal of 
conservative economic policy. 

President George W. Bush's new 
agenda says it all: 

" 

about the Clinton years. 
Half the party wants to become 

"Republican lite" after the "man-
date" of Kerry's defeat, and the 
other half, led by soon-to-bc-
chairman Howard Dean, want to 
"energize the party's core." 

Both sides are wrong. Jf the 
Democrats want to win, they can't 
wait for Republ ican policy to lead 
the country back to the 1890 , then 
tell voters "I told you so." T hey 
also can't win by moving to the 
right, effectively admitting that the 
Republicans were correct all along.

who aren't buying new Ferraris

. 'Review 

CALPIRG works on 
behalf of students 
Editor: 
This week CALPIRG 

(California Public Interest Research 
Group) will be running its quarterly 
pledge drive at VCSD. CALPIRG 
is a student organization ",hos!' 
focus centers on campaigns geared 
toward helping the environment, 
a lle \~ating the problems of htmgcr 
and homelessness, keeping our 
water safe, and helping students 
fight the rising costs of education. 
CALPIRG is a student organization 
that is run and funded by you, the 
5nldents. Thirty thousand students 
in the UC system are able to pool 
their financial resources together 
through supporting CALPIRG to 
hire experts to work on our behalf 
on the issues we care about With 
d1.is suppOrt, CALPIRG is able to 
give students a voice in a political 
system that is dominated by special 
interests and to let politicians know 
that students care about what is 
going on around them. 

Recent CALP[RG achievements 
here at UCSD include last week's 
press conference, which revealed 
unfair business practices within the 
textbook publishing industry that 
fo rce students to spend up to 20 
percem of their annual col lege 
expenses on textbooks. We were 
covered by local TV, radio and 
newspapers and really got the word 
our to publishers that we're on to 
them and won't put up with risi ng 
textbook prices any longer. 

On the environmental front, 
we're running a campaign this year 
to help pass the olar Homes Bill in 
the state Legislature, which would 
drastically reduce the reliance on 
nonrenewable sources of energy and 
help keep the rising costs of e1ectric-

ity down in California. Locally, we 
participate in rc!,rular beach cleanups 
through our Water Watch project to 
make sure we're doing our part in 
the La Jolla communiry. 

[n the wake of dlC tsunami dis-
as ter that affected millions of peo-
ple in South Asia and portions of 
Eastern Africa, CALP[RG is work-
ing as parr of a broad-based tsuna-
mi reli ef coal ition on campus to 
raise funds and goods for the inter-
national relief efforts . 

All of dlis is on top of the numer-
ous achievements CALPIRG Stu-
dents have accomplished over the 
years: We helped pass the Clean 
Water Enforcement Act, now dlC 
country\; roughest clean water law; 
helped raise $2,000 for the San 
Diego Rescue Mission last year 
alone; helped secure lower interest 
rates on certain student loans, sav-
ing many borrowers up to $1 ,000; 
and registered thousands of students 
to vote last quarrer almle. 

All these achievements are only 
possible widl your help. \l\Iithout 
pledging CALPIRG members, 
CALPIRG would not be able to 
run these campaigns and hire advo-
cates who represcnryour needs and 
interests in the state and national 
capitals. For those who have 
pledged already, I thank you for 
your continu('d suppOrt, and for 
those who haven't, please take the 
time to consider pledging to help 
CALPIRG keep ge tting results on 
the issues we all care about.

Women don't innately 
differ from men 

Editor: 
I thank columnist Evelyn Hsieh 

for bringing dle topic of gender dif-

ference to the attention of UCSD 
students. ("Men and women still dif-
ferent," Jan. 24) . I think this is an 
important issue to identify in today's 
sociery because we should be aware 
that subconscious stereotyping of an 
"equal" culture such as women can 
influence the way they form their 
own identity, causing women to con-
form to the stereotypes. Vv'hile J 
appreciate the attention to dlis mat-
ter, I absolutely cannot condone 
your suggestion that certain "innate 
differences" do exist in the mental 
and emotional state of women in 
comparison with men. lbis is a 
stereotype in itself - exacdy what 
women today are trying to shake off 
from a past of inferiority, especially 
in the career field. 

The reason for the skew of 
female undergraduates toward dle 
arts and social sciences is a result of 
this exact mode of thought - the 
idea that women are naturally better 
in these areas because of some bio-
logical difference. If women are led 
to believe that this is the case by arti-
cles like this one, the numbers will 
never spread out over the plane of 
diverse undergraduate majors. We 
should be trying to solve the prob-
lem of unequal distribution and real-
ize that women are still coming 
through the last phases of obtaining 
equal recognition in many areas of 
life; we should not be justifying the 
exact stereotypes that discourage 
women to enter these fields. 

1 don 't think this article can speak 
on behalf of the entire female sex, 
enforcing the stereotype that as an 
entire gender "we're pretty emo-
tional and analytical" because thi s is 
a misunderstanding of many 
women, who do not display these 
traits any more than men. ot only 
are false stereotypes of women 
asserted in this article, but claims 
grouping men together with gender-

Save 5100 on 
LSAT Prep!! . 

specific attributes also assign them 
traits more favorauJe to a career set-
ting than dlose of women. Men are 
portrayed as "objecti\·e in their 
thought processes," while the claim 
that women are defined as emotion-
al, implies that they are not capahle 
of t1us type of objective thought and, 
therefore, much less credible, espe-
cially in the workplace. 

The fact is that women have 
overcome periods in hist<1iy when 
the popular social standard was that 
they were not as capable of doing 
many of the dlings they excel at 
today. They have broken out of tra-
ditional femal e roles of professional 
and educational obscuriry and now 
have demonstrated success in majors 
such as biology, in which they are the 
majority (as referred to in dle arti-
cle). This is proof dlat women are 
still in the process of ga ining rightful 
recognition and canceling out 
stereotypes that, when internalized, 
can wlintentionall y affect their per-
ception of identiry and self-worth. 
What this articl e has subjected all of 
its readers to is ex-bascd stereotyp-
ing implying that women share these 
traits as a whole and not as indi\~du­
als. I for one do not want thi article 
speaking for who 1 alll . 

Overall , 1 alll speaking out 
against stereotypes of all races and 
religions, genders and gender identi-
ties, etlUliciti cs and exu,,1 orienta-
tions. We should identity ule proh-
lem, not come up widl excuses why 
there will always be unequal distrib-
ution for women among social and 
na tural sciences. The hest \\ a y to 
hel P is to break down srcreotype, 
imposed on women by society. I 
have a feeling that women will make 

~eir way equally into science-hased 
majors. But views as cxprcs,ed in dlis 
article only make it harder.

"[t's certainly a report that will

\Nolfram's capital -contract solu-

"The idea appeals to me 
because 1 would definitely appreci-
ate it if tuition went down, but it 
doe n't rcally seem feasible, " Ro 
said. "The idea that taking away 
aid would just make tuition 
decrease and not have other conse-

Ro is one of more than 5 mil -

'Idministra ti on's proposed 2005

be decreased.

It looks like a red door from the storage room of a high school drama department - roughly 
painted and cheerfully vandal-
ized. The first indications that this 
door is more than just that are 
the images of two medieval 
saints scratched into the reflec-
tive windowpanes. Then there's 
the ancient fertility figure with 
pink polka dots on its left side jut-
ting out from the bottom of the 
door, sitting on some faded piano 
keys. The work , titled "1 Billion 
Saints ," is displayed in Angelbert 
Metoyer's exhibit at the 
University Art Gallery, which 
opened in January and will run 
through March 19. 

Encouraged to cultivate his art 
from an early age , Metoyer par-
ticipated In various art competi-
tions and eventually studied at 
the Atlanta College of Art and 
Design . Since then , he has been 
featured in several group and 
individua l exhibits and has 
obta ined a cosmopolitan follow-
ing . Two of the pieces in the 
exh ibit, "Hollywood" and 
"Olydon," are owned by San 
Diego Chargers linebacker 
Donnie Edwards, and other 
prominent fans of Metoyer's 
works include Dr. Ore and Oprah . 

Metoyer incorporates many 
symbols in hiS work. Most of the 
pieces have numbers with con-
notations (3 , 7, 13) as well as 
numbers without such (6 , 8, 14) 
floating around them like alpha-
bet soup. HIS Juxtaposition of 
such numbers challenges the 
viewer to rethink the traditional 
meaning of numbers. 

body of preserved work. His 
pieces are a sort of artistic year-
book, on which people from dif-
ferent times and places have 
"autographed" their artistic lega-
cies. He employs a wide variety 
of media, including disembodied 
pages of books, sheet music and 
even bird down. 

Savannah mammals in "6 
Moments (1-12)" show cave-
men 's first attempts at art; the 
winged horse Pegasus and the 
ferryman Charon represent 
ancient Greek mytholog)l, while 
differen t angel and saint figures 
reflect Christian art. Instead of a 
typical setting, these figures are 
enveloped with colorful nOise 
that frames them effectively and 
sets them apart as entities in 
themselves . 

These images culminate in the 
centerpiece of the exhibit , the 
epic "The House of Warriors " 
Standing at approximately 13 
feet by 13 feet , the work incorpo-
rates the mythology of his other 
work as well as various geomet-
ric figures transcribed within one 
another, which gives it an ancient 
Mesoamerican feel The rich 
complexity of the mythological 
images portrayed in the piece 
shows that element of timeless-
ness, Against the backdrop of 
established Images, Metoyer 
adds his own mark, includtng the 
trio of toddlers and the numbers, 
In choosing to represent war-
nors, ubiquitous in ancient art , he 
connects disparate civilizations 
In a satisfying manne r. If on ly 
they sold posters like this on 
Library Walk.

Angel bert Metoyer's work compounds different eras of 
human experience to re-examine conventional symbolism 
By Thomas Kim, Staff Writer 

"Angels in Space'" also chal-
lenges tradition In that it reverses 
the traditional left to right direc-
tion of time; it shows a chrono-
logit,;ClI devuiution from right to 
left in the form of three toddler 
figures. The first child's angelic 
wings and smooth lines turn into 
double chins and wrinkles that 
show time's perversion of individ-
ual purity. 

But the main theme of 
Metoyer's work seems to be lay-
ering various civilizations and 
human experiences. In th is 
sense, time adds richness to the 

mall olarolds of human faces, 
safety-pinned to the dress with 
roughly cut red ribbon , seem to 
symbolize embryonic seeds of 
the shaman . What is spec ial 
about this piece is that Metoyer 
completed it in January at UCSD 
whi le overseeing the assembly of 
the exhibit and used student 
curator Rachel Faust's and vari-
ous other UCSD students' faces

'It's all about hip-hop' at Porter's Me Battles 
Amateurs spark up rap culture with rhyming competition, where love for the music is only prerequisite 

By ADAM STALEY 
Staff Writer 

For hip-hop kids hele at UCSD, it is easy to feel part of the minority. The roughly 
forty people in Porter's Pub for 
the Jan. 26 MC battle didn't dis-
pel any feelings of being mar-
ginalized, but it was quite 
refreshing to meet some stu-
dents that actually listen to hip-
hop and know about what they 
speak. 

The MC battle didn't begin 
until 11 p.m., but OJ Nocturnal 
(Adam Gould, a Thurgood 
Marshall College senior by day) 
began sp.inning around 9 p,m., 
filling Porter's with classic hip-
hop; he played everything from 
newer artists like Mos Oef, 
Jurassic 5 and Nas, to more old 
school rap like Slick Rick, Eazy-E, 
LL Cool J's "Mama Said Knock 
You Out," and even Rodney O. 

and Joe Cooley's "Everlasting 
Bass." Waiting two hours for the 
battle to start was made easier 
not only by Nocturnal's beats, 
but also Swami G (AKA Krishna 
Katukota), an Earl Warren 
College senior and theeveninis 
master of ceremonies, wFio 
went from slow-flowing from his 
chair to pumping up the crowd 
to keep the audience enter-
tained. 

The Mickey's models helped 
out in this area as well - without 
anyon-campus sponsors, Gould 
and Katukota have had to turn 
to the malt liquor company and 
Red Bull for sponsorship -
although you will never catch 
me rocking my free Mickey's 
hat. 

By the time the battle began, 
each participant had already 
shaken off the rust by busting a 
few flows, with reigning champi-
on MC MARSs freestyle lead-

ing into the competition. 
MAR.S., a thirty-year-old non-
affilliate, seemed to be the MC 
to beat, coming with a deliber-
ate, smooth flow, spittin~ that he 
has "ill-type preCision, which 
was not belied by his perfor-
mance. Unfortunately, MARS. 
was dethroned early in the com-
petition by friefld Philly B, who 
needed two battles to prove to 
Katukota that he deserved a 
pass to the second round. 

Each contestant came with a 
unique style, and most weren't 
overly confrontational or "8 Mile," 
as Gould put it, deciding to put 
their lyrical skills to test rather 
than simply dissing each other. 

Viet, the first person to put his 
neck out, had weighty lyrics that 
may have gone over the audi-
ence's head at times, while 
other rappers like Steakhouse 
had a more aggressive, in-your-
face style. 

Another standout was Kiki, 
whose flow had the audience 
shouting "Cha li 2na," even 
though his content was much 
more in the vein of Too Short, 
including a hilarious line refer-
encing the Mickey's women. 

After about 45 minutes of 
trading bars between the MCs, 
Katukota, with the help of the 
audience, narrowed it down to 
Philly Band Kiki for the title. The 
finalists were able to display their 
skills in a longer cipher, and Philly 
B brought Ris best verse yet, 
cleverly switching up his rhyme 
scheme to take the victory. 

It became clear shortly after 
the finals that declaring the vic-
tor was not the ultimate goal of 
the session, as all of the MCs 
went back on stage again after-
wards. All were gracious in 
defeat as well, particularly MC 
MAR.S., who declared that "it's 
all about hip-hop" after his 

departure. 
Referring to the freestyling at 

Porter's as "battling" might give 
some the wrong impreSSion, 
since it is hip-hop, not battling, 
that takes center stage. From the 
atmosphere before the contest 
to the diversity of the partici-
pan ts, the main fo rce behind 
this was a profound love of hip-
hop from all parties. 

You don't have to look too 
hard to find alternative, punk or 
indie culture at UCSD, but locat-
ing the hip-hop can often be a 
more trying task. UCSO's hip-
hoppers have nothing to com-
plain about anymore, an outlet 
has been found, so come one, 
come all, and see what our col-
lege has to offer to the hip-hop 
world. 

Next week's MC Battle has 
been postponed. Keep your 
eyes out for notice of the next 
one in the upcoming weeks.

A crash course in Bollywood 
'Bride and Prejudice' trades corsets for saris 

By NEHA SINGH 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Welcome to Bollywood, a world filled wi tR gorgeous actors, extravaga nt song-and-dance sequences, over-the-
top drama and happy endings. The name is a 
combination of Hollywood and Bombay, 
lndia (now known as Murnbai), and alludes 
to the booming film industry there that pro-
duces over 800 films each year. With her new 
film "Bride and Prejudice," writer-producer-
director Gurinder Chadha ("Bend It Like 
Beckham") gives us a crash course on the 
genre by taking a classic Jane Austen Story 
and re-working it with saris, songs and sexu-
al tension. 

Instead of a ta Ic about upper and lowcr 
classes in England, Chadha's film is a love 
story spannmg the globe between different 
nationaliti es and culnlres. Yes, thi s is the 
sa me old story we have seen over and over in 
many adaptadom. T here again is \I\'ill Darcy 
(,\1anin Hendcr~o n), on I)' this tIIne he's an 
elite, arrogant American heir to a major hotel 
chain, Then there is Lizzy Bennett, renamed 
blita Baks~i (the ,tunning Ai shwarya Rai, 
BolI)'wood's reignmg star and former i\1is 
World), and t.he vdlainous bad boy Wickham 
(Daniel Gillies). Chadha recast ,1\1 r. Bingley 
as Balmj G'!aveen norelVs, who currently 
acts In the ABC series "Lost"), Darcy's best 
fri end who IS In love WIth Lalira 's sist~r,Jaya 
(Namrata Shlrodkar, another Bollywood 
actress and former ,\1iss Indl:l). Lastly, the

Film 
REVIEW 

Visually, this film is a knockout. If you see 
it, do so on the big screen. The colors are 
intense and reminiscent of the vivid three-
strip Technicolor films circa 1935- 1955 . By 
the time the setting changes from Amritsar (a 
small town in Punjab) to Goa (a popular 
Indian beach town), then to London and 
Santa Monica, Calif., Indian cinematograph-
er Santosh Sivan has created a vibrant film 
bursti ng with color and energy. 

The music is upbeat and lively, though 
those not exposed to many musicals might 
take some time to get used to it. Legendary 
Bollywood composer Anu Malik did the 
film's music; with lyrics by Farhan and Zoya 
Akhtar. Even though the actOr, break Ollt in 
song and dan e at the sltghtest plot tWIst. Ihe 
Akh tars honed the film 's ~ong line by lin(; 
and note by no te to assure that they would be 
integral to the unfolding stol)'. Sarol Khan 
choreographed all the dance number and 
brings a contagious energy to the musical 
scenes. 

Overall, Chadha brilliantly succeeds in 
infusing the Ea t and Wcst together in this 
feisty, li ght romanti c comedy. ller film 
makes the case that even the most flamboy-
Jnt film can be as universal as it is exotic, 
especially when it produces that glow of hap-
pil y ever after. Infectious, "Bride and 
Prejudice" will bring a smile to even the 
purist'S lips.

masturhation that neglect 
everything rock m usicians 
have do ne fo r the art of 
th e o ne-stri ng wonder

The Exies would be fu n 
to listcn LO in a b.lr, like 
any othcr cover band, bur 
thei r lack of origi nal ound 
keeps them from joining 
the ranks of successful 
"rad io-friendly" bands like 
the Killers and ,\\ use. 

One-half SLar for keep-
ing a stcady beat. One-half

FIfteen year is a long time to raise a child. Riot-folk-feminist Ani 
DiFranco releases her 
tcen~ge prodigy KJllu'k!e 
DIr<J!1I to anticipating f:IIlS 
and se rial dabblers alike 
loolong for more definition 
to her persona. The 15 th 
album in 15 years from her 
OlVn label Righreous Babe 
offers no red flag in change . 
hut rather pursue the soft 
and subtle evolution of a 
wretcheuly talented anist 
growing only more skjllful 
in storytelling. 

The prolific singcr-

son1"wri rcr produces an 
album of 12 self-cont~ ined 
shorr stOries told through 
her urgelll and coy I·oice. 
T he passionless tracks 
knock IJiFranco's quirky 
novelty; there art no diuy-
ing highs or srrikjng 
moments like the ones in 
"Little Plastic Castles" and 
"Not A Pretty Girl." 
Ins tead, DiFranco takes the 
middle-grow1d tone of her 
previous records and spins 
sungs about family dysfunc-
tion and failing rcbtion-
srups with an edge of acer-
bic bite on the ear. 

1 Ier lemon-drop songs 
are missing thei r zlIlg; 
instead they arc reliable, 
sugary hard candies. The 
brilliant "bang and strum" 
music carries most of 
KJluckle DowlI. \ Vith a guitar 
and 1I slew of carefully cho-
sen collaborators, DIFranco 
pounds out her signantre 
sound, which stays fresh and 
unique de~pite its many 
reincarnations.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

A troubadour whose time has come 
eonar Oberst's voice still trembles, though the spotlight is brighter 

By CODY NABOURS 
Staff Write r 

With a flouri shing record label and no less lhan five critical-ly acclaimed albums under 
his belt, Conor Oberst is dancing 
on the brink of stardom. 
Songwri ter and b :lI1dleader of a 
rotating collection of musicians 
collectively ca lled Bright Eyes, 
Oberst has risen from indie wun-
derkind to the "next big thi ng" in 
music these days . Perhaps it was 
his role in rhe Vote for Change 
tour, where Bright Eyes shared 
the stage with legends Bruce 
Springsteen and R .E.M., or 
Oberst 's srint as concubine for 
Winona Ryder; regardless, the 24-
year-old is , at the least, a big 
thing. Far more importantly, he 's 
the real thing. 

Oberst fits many precariolls 
adjectives : neurotic, clulllsy, inse-
cure, vain, romantic and often 
melodramatic. His quaveri ng 
voice and oddly phrased, occa-
sionally brilliant lyri cs are some of 
hi s trademarks, but far more 
memorable is his intense passion, 
which forges an empathetic con-
nection with the listener. creating 
moods and elllotions as intense as 
the experi ences he describes. 
Possessing an eerily piercing gaze 
and a "more-cmo-than-emo" 
fashion sense, Oherst writes songs 
that arc the apotheOSIS of music 
that makes olle feel emotions in a 
way that encompasses a myriad 
rangepf human feeling, from hap-
piness to loneliness and every-
thing in berween. 

Bright Eyes' dual album 
release in January was a watershed 
moment for Oberst, with the 

clumsily beautiful all-country I'm 
Wide Awake, It 's Morning and the 
guitar-rock-band-based Digirnl 
Asb in a Digital Urn heralded by 
glowing reviews from the main-
tream and independent press 

alike. Bright Eyes , however, have 
been creating top-quality albums 
for years; 1998's Letting Ofl rbr 
Happiness, recorded by a still-
teenage Oberst along with musi-
cians from Neutral Milk Hotel, 
among other bands, with its 
believability and maturity. 
Oberst's then - fledglin g record 
la bel, Saddle Creek, re leased 
Fevrrs Al1d MiTTors in 2000. T he 
inspirarion for the name of the 
label came from his hometown of 
Omaha, Neb. With carefully pre-

cious beauty and raw, if purpose-
fully melodramatic, emotion, the 
album was a cohesive and impres-
sive work, weaving tal es about 
loneliness and self-examinati on, 
erealing characters as pathetic and 
compelling as Elvis Costello's" [ 
Want You" narrator and ending 
with an existentialist radio inter-
view freak-out in the style of 
David Lynch that was both creep), 
and self-aware. The next album, 
Lifted .. . 0,; Tbe St071 Is in tbe oil, 
Krep Your Ear to tb e G"olmd, 
arrived in 2002, when Oberst was 

.only 22 . Lifted made most rep-
utabl e magazines' "Best of 2002" 
lists, and deservedly so.

Oberst: A skinny new hero 
voices protest and pain 

continued from page / / 
Developing a more country-fl a-
vored sound, Oberst expanded 
upon the raw emotion of past 
albums, penning woefully sad-yet-
brilli ant folk songs ("You Will . 
Yo u? Will. You ? Wil l. You? 
Will. "), precious and innocent 
baroque pop songs 
(" Bowl Of 
O ranges"), and joy-

" 

young Oberst, combined with his 
piercin gly passionate delivery, 
recreate moments in Oberst's life, 
baring the soul of a man torn 
bet\\'een innoce nce and wicked-
ness, stardom and shyness, depres-
sion and joy. Howeve r, unlike the 
grave l-voiced legend, Oberst i 

ous sing-a long 
barnstormers about 
politics, natural 
beaury and li fe 
("Let 'S Not Shit 
O urselves (To Love 
and to Be Loved)"). 
Compared to the 
body of his work, 
Lifted is arguably 
the pi nnac I e of 

Oberst is only now, 
weU into his career, 
becoming a political 
voice as well as an 

only now, well 
into his career, 
becoming a pol iti-
cal voice a well as 
an arti stic one. 
His passionate 
delivery is perfect-
ly suited to poli ti-
cal songs, as in his 
free iTunes store 
single, "When 
The President 
Talks to od," artistic one. " 

Oberst 's musical 
genius. T he most recent albums, 
however, seem to be the more 
immediate, consumer-navored 
harbingers of Bright Eyes' furore 
conques t of the mainstream. 

People wi ll call Oberst "the next 
Bob Dylan." T ruly, just as the 
words of Dylan weave tales that 
seem real and surrea l, yc t immi -
nently memorable, the lyrics of the 

where O berst 
cl u m ~ i ly asks, 

Does he ask to rape our women's 
rights! And send poor farm kids off 
to die! Does Gael suggest an 011 
hike! When rhe pres idenr talks to 
God?" 

Oberst can never be the next 
Bob Dylan, but he's already the fi rst 
Conor Oberst.

After Master's College loaded 
the bases in the first inning and 
scored one unearned run in the 
frame, UCSD senior starter Logan 
Boutilier (1-0) took control, sending 
each batter back to the dugout over 
the next five irmings, to earn the vic-
tory.

6. Sophomore Seth Spector 
played No. 4 si ngles, but was 
unable to defeat Azuza Pacific's 
Adam Davidson , losing 6-1,6-4. 

"vVe learned a lot from the 
Azusa match," Swan said. "This 
was the first collegiate match for 
many of our starters. They were 
able to get a fee l for how good 
competition is and this gave us 
an indicator as to where we are at 
[compared to other teams). It 
was good that we faced them 
early in the season because it 
shows that we still have a lot to 
improve." 

Six seniors g raduated last 
year, and only four players 
returned (i ncluding two starters),

"This year's team is quite 

young from a match experience 
perspective," Steidlmayer s'lid. 
"We don't have the seasoned vet-
erans like we did last year." 

1n 2004, the Tritons made a 
very impressivc run to the NCAA 
Division II Championship 
Festival by defeating Hawaii-
Hilo to advance to the R'ound of 
16 for the first time since moving 
to Divi sion n. But the season 
came to an end when the men's 
winni ng streak was stopped by 
eventual National Champion 
West Florida, their overall record 
concluding at 18- 10.

UCSD's five-run fifth inning put 
the Tritons ahead 8-1. Though the 
Mustangs attempted to creep back 
into the game by putting up si ngle 
runs in each of the last three innings 
and loading the bases in the ninth, 
UCSD's lead proved to be too 
much. Triton closer Shlomo Lipetz 
struck out the final batter of the 
game, Master's Coll ege catcher 
Brett Jamie , who stranded three 
nmners on base. 

Tritons Hernandez, Morehead

Stemming fro m a successful 
2004 campaign in which the Tritons 
finished 35 -24 and qualified for the 
CCAA tournament for the fi rst 
time, the 2005 UCSD baseball team 
is poised and ready to showcase its

Polo: Tritons show strength against Hartwick 
comlnl/cd from page I 6 

minute, 5 eco nd s left in the 
cunrest, ending a back-and -forth 
tussle that began with a Clevenger 
goal only 1:08 inro the gamc. 

After Hartwi ck's Kate 
Chambers tied the score at 6-6 
with 2 :03 remaining and an ejec-
tion that left the Tritons with a 
six-on-five advantage, H ockett 
received a swift pass in front of the 
nct and fired the ball into the cage 
for her first goal of the sea on. 
Hockett's score on a power pla y 
wa s a sign of progress for the 
Tritons, who had failed to convert 
some late advantages in their 5-4 
loss to No. 12 Michigan on Feb. 3. 

" We played so lid ball against 
Hartwick, and rhe fact that we 
scored on a six-on-five was a defi-
nite improvement from what we 
did against Michigan . This time it 
won us the game," Sanders said . 

UCSD's only deficit of the game 
lasted one minute, 15 econds, after 
Hartwick's Megan Dah l-Smith 
grabbed the ball from three meters 
out, leaned away from UCSD 
sophomore two-merer Bri tta 
N ordstrom and lobbed it into the 
net for a 3-2 lead with 1:13 left in 
the second period. But with two 
seconds left before halftim e, 
UCSD senior two-meter Lindsay . 
Gro sman put the ball past goal -
tender Olivia olebo urne to 
deflate Hartwick's momentum 
heading into the locker room. 

With in the span of a min ute 
shortly after the half, senior driver 
Tobi Lyman and sophomore two-
meter Samh Bajorek gave UCSD 
a two-goal cushion, the largest o f 
th e COnte5t. \Vith a six-on -five 
advantage fullow lIlg Aliria 
Nlunoz's ejection, Lyman rired a 
shot into th e top corner o f the 
cage for her four th goal in two 
days . JU St 1 :0 1 late r, Bajorek 

opened up the lead with a shot 
from a few meters ou t. 

"We were finishing our oppor-
tunities and capitalizing, getting 
more comfortable after the first 
game jitters," said seni or driver 
Jessica Wong who had a goal in 
the match. "Any win tha t boosts 
your confidence is a good win." 

Wong scored UCSD's first goal 
in its match against VIWPA rival 
Loyola Marymuunt, but only after 
the Li ons had raced out to a 4-0 
lead. Wong's tally brought the 
Tritons to within three before the 
half, but Loyola Marymount 's 
Katie Hicks restored the Lions' 
advantage earl y in the third peri-
od . The Tritons responded with a 
Clevenger goal with 4:50 left in 
the period , but Hicks scored aga in 
just 17 seconds later to seal the 
deal. Six of the L ions' goa ls came 
on six-on-five advantages; in com-
par(son, the Tritons only went 2-
fo r- lI on the power play. 

The Tritons struck firs t in their 
match against UC Santa Barbara 
on Feb . 6 with a Clevenger goal. 
The Gauchos came back with 
three scores to close out the first 
quarter and another by Sarah 
Kovach before junior two meter 
player Kristen Frazer converted a 
man -u p advantage with I :07 left 
in the ha lf to reduce the defici t. 
From the near right corner of th e 
pool, Wong fired a pa ss through 
the UC Santa Barbara defense 
that landed right on the fin gertips 
uf Frazer, who pushed the ball 
into the top left corn er, past the 
outstr etched arms of the Gaucho 
goa l tender. 

But before the Tritons could 
regain any momentum, the 
Gauch os responded with three 
more unanswered goals in the 
thIrd period . Lyman , H ockett :lIld 
Clevenger would each no tch a 

goal in the second half, but the 
damage was already done for the 
Tritons, who had troubl e getting 
their defense in sync th roughout 
the match . 

" \-\le were lIlaking mistakes that 
good teams would be able to capi-
talize on," Sanders said . "Seeing 
that UC Santa Barbara is a good 
team, it was no surpri e that they 
were able to score that many 
points on us, when really, our 
offense was ticking enough to 
keep up with them." 

Against WWPA rival UC 
Davis, the defensive attack greatly 
improved, holding the Aggies to 
only four goals, their second- low-
est offensive output of the season. 
And for most of the game, it 
seemed that the offensive attack 
would not suffer the same fate the 
defense did in the previous match , 
as Clevenger and Lyman scored at 
the 5: 14 and 2 :52 marks, respec-
tive! y, in the second period to send 
both teams into the half tied at 
two apiece. 

In the second half, however, 
Christi Raycraft and Katherine 
O'Rourke pur twO more poi nts on 
the scoreboard, the second goal 
coming with 4:02 left in t he game, 
without any response fro m the 
weekend-weary Tritons . Wong 
fina ll y got started late with her 
score at the 1:43 mark, but the 
Aggies stined the UCSD attack 
long enough to escape with th e 
close \~ ctory. 

"\ Ve had two games Sunday we 
could have won ," Sand ers said. 
"Now it's up to US to rebound in 
practice and try to be more consis-
tent on both sides of the pool." 

T he comp etition o nl y get 
stron ge r for th e Tritons, who will 
travel LIp th e coast on Feb. 12 to 
tangle with the No. 5 Long Beach 
State 4'Jers. Game time is 3t noon .

Baseball hungry to top· CCAA 
Tritons smash Vanguard in 20-7 route 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

A ,trong core of renlrners com-
bmed with new talent shows 
promise for the 1005 UCS D base-
ball tcam. Picked to win the South 
DiviSion of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, and 
to be a top contender for the 
CCAA Championship, the Tritons 
are determined to live up to the 
hype and play solid collegiate base-
ball. The team has already proved 
ItS, determination with significant 
wins over Vanguard and Ma ters 
Collcgt!. 

"\Vc are known as one of the 
better teams in the conference," 
UCSD head coach Dan O'Brien 
said. "But we want to be the be t." 

Thirteen senivl~ 'nd 12 juniors 
compmc the bulk of the 2005 ros-
ter, brmgmg experience, talent and 
J competitive fire to tlus year' 
squad. The ve terans, combined 
With the solid recruited class of 

player~, show strength on both 
~ ltles of the field. 

"ThiS team IS pretty solid top to 
bottonl," O'Urien said. " It is a

who can competc at the highest 
level." 

n offensively and defensively 
,oullLl tcam, LlC D prides itself on 
Its I,a 'c-rwlIling slalls. 

h fhe abili ty to play heads-up 
baseball on the base paths is some-
thinl-[ tha t we emphasizc continual-
ly, and we ~trive to he the best 
b3s('n lllning te"'l1 in the confer-
ence," O'Brien said. 

Dd'cnslvely, the Tritons rerum a 
vere r.m infield and outfield that are 

pearh~'lded by the pitthmg staff. 
" \ Vc; h,lve five vetera n pitchers 

m thl' ~rarting rOtation this season 
who Iw'e all had ucces at this 
b'eI, mtl we have brought in dif-
fercnt guys to help out of the 
hullpen," O'Brien said. "The foun-

Going yard: Junior outfielder Matt La'NSOn and UCSD's baseball team have scored 
30 runs against Vanguard and Masters College in the first two games of the season. 
dation of the pitching staff stems 
from our three veteran starters who 
significantl y contributed to our 
success last season." 

O'Brien 's 2005 starti ng lineup 
pens senior Joel Clark in left field, 
junior Damian Fante in right field 
and junior transfer Matt Lawson in 
center field . Seniors Brian 
Robinson, Ricky Pinocchio, Keith 
Hernandez and Alex Gascon will 
play first base, second base, hort-
Stop and third base, respectively. 
Sophomore David Morehead will 
catch and sophomore Brian Trump 
will be the designated hitter. 

The starting lineup proved solid 
as UCSD opened the 2005 season 
in non-conference action against 
Vanguard Univer ity (2-3) on Feb. 
5 with a convincing 20-7 win. The 
Tri tons combined for 20 hitS in the 
game and showcased thei r array of 
offensive weapons by smacking 
seven doubles, three triples and a 
pair of back-to-back home runs by 
Hernandez and Morehead. 

Down 7-6 after tIlIee innings of 
play, UCSD woke up and put up 14 

rur)s over the next three innings, 
includi ng a nine-rwl fifth, to seal 
the victory. 

In the bottom of the fifth , the 
Tritons put the game out of reach 
when Gascon started the inning 
with a triple to right field . Fante 
followed with a double, bri nging in 
Ga con. Lawson reached on an 
error. Clark then ingled, driving in 
an RBI. With one out and the bases 
loaded, Trump doubled to center-
field, clearing the bases and giving 
the Tritons a 14-7 lead. 

Junior Ryan Leake (1-0) pitched 
three scorele s innings for the 
Tritons and earned the victory after 
giving up only one hit and trilcing 
o ut five. Senior Trent C rotts, junior 
Matt Sweany and freshman Nick 

an Filippo each pitched a scoreless 
inning for UCSD.Junior southpaw 
starter Jose avarro threw for 
three innings, allowing seven hits 
and four earned runs.

Triton have offense and defense, hut riot together

Senior Staff Writer 

promising start fizzled into 
di appointment for the o. 14 
UCSD wome ns' water polo 
team: After handily defeating 

o. 15 Ilartwick College, 7-6, 
for its first win of the young sea-
son , the Tritons suffered losses to 

o. 4 Loyola Marymou nt, No. 9 
UC Sama Barbara and No. 13 
UC Davis to finish sixth out of a 
field oJ 12 at the Triton 
Invitational , held Feb. 5 and Feb. 
6 at Canyonview Pool. 

The overall fini h wasn 't so 
disappointing for the Tritons ( 1-
3, 0-2 Western Water Polo 
A socia tion) except fo r that, had 
the team won two close deci-
sions, it could just as easi ly have 
gone 3-1. The problem was that 
when either UCS D's sturdy 
defense or vinle attack roared, 
the othe r wou ld falter. The 
defe nse controlled much of the 
tempo in the 4-3 loss to UC 
Davi , but the o ffense cou ld not 
pull away from the Aggies. 
Likewise, senior driver Courtney 
Clevenger sco red three goals in 
the 9-2 loss to Loyola 
Marymount and in the 9-5 los to 
U Santa Barbara , but the 
defe nse was unable to kcep the 
Tritons within striking di stance. 

"This weekend we were incon-
sistent," UCSD head coach Larry 
Sanders said. "We were doing one 
thing or another. Against UCSB, 
our defense wasn 't in sync but our 
offense was good, while against 
Davis, our defense was much bet-
ter but our offense seemed to mis-
fire ." 

When finally combined, 
though, the UCSD attack can be 
very potent, as exhibited in the 
Hartwick, N .Y., match on Feb. 5. 
Sophomore two-meter Natalie 
Hockett gave the Tritons the vic-
tory with a power-play goal with

First-ranked Azusa 
Pacific beats Tritons, 8-1 
Young members of men's tennis squad 

benefit from first collegiate match 
By ANGELA LIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
opened its season on Feb. 5 with an 
8-1 loss against the National 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics ' top-ranked Azusa Pacific 
University. 

The Tritons couldn 't capture 
any of the three doubles matches at 
the start, giving the Cougars a 3-0 
lead going into the singles match-
es. T he men's No. I doubles lost 2-
8, while both No.2 and No.3 dou-
bles lost very close matches at 6-8. 

The men's only match win 
came from No. 6 singles, junipr 
Erik Oijala , who played Tom 
Jelsma in a three-set victory, 4-6, 
6-2,4-1. 

"Oijala has battled injuries dur-
ing his tiMe at UCSD and was able 
to com e out a victor against 

Azusa ," head coac h Eric 
Steidlmayer said. "He played well, 
and tha t was certainly fun to sec." 

At o. I singles, senior captain 
Bryan Swatt put up great hustle, 
but was outmaneuvered by a hara-
serving opponent, Sam 'Fletcher, 
and lost the firs t set 1-6. Swatt 
came out fired up in the second set, 
bu t FletcheL was able to chase 
down some nicely placed shots and 
closed the match 3-6. Playing No. 
2 singles, junior Brent Molden was 
able to pull out three sets against 
lefty Boris Bakalov; after winning 
the first set 4-6, Molden could not 
ha ng onto his lead, and lost the 
next two sets 2 -6, 4-6.
