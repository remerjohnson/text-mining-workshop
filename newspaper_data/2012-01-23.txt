UC Regents 
to Rally in 
Sacramento

The UC Board of Regents will rally 
alongside students, staff and faculty at the 
state Capitol in May, chair of the board Sherry 
Lansing announced at the Jan. 18 Regents 
meeting. 

“We are really happy that the Regents have 
decided to work with us to put pressure on 
the state,” Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji said. “It shows that our activism 
last year really had an impact.”

The Board of Regents will hold its May 16 
and 17 meeting at the Sacramento Convention 
Center in order to participate in the rally and 
to address effects of cuts in state funding to 
the UC system.

“The truth is, this university was founded 
by and for the people of California,” Lansing 
said in a statement released after the meeting. 
“Unless our elected representatives start 
funding us at a realistic level, UC’s ability 
to serve the state and its citizens will be at 
serious risk. UC is the best investment in 
California’s economic future that our state 
leaders can make. It’s up to all of us to remind 
them of that.”

Lansing met with students from UCSD

Protestors interrupted a Jan. 19 Regents 
meeting held at UC Riverside, resulting in a 
closed meeting and police violence.

A large group of students and a few 
faculty members attended the beginning 
of the meeting, which had a 20-minute 
public comment period. Regents Board 
Spokeswoman Sherry Lansing extended the 
comment period for another 20 minutes. 
When that time period ended, the students 
gave a speech about how they felt the regents 
were not representing the interests of students 
or workers at the University of California.

The students were upset because they 
were only given one minute of speaking time 
during the public comment session.

“It’s very patronizing and paternalistic the 
way they do it; they actually allow only one 
minute to each speaker and there is a timer 
that goes off promptly at one minute,” Ethnic 
Studies Ph.D. student Alborz Ghandehari 
said.

UCSD, SDSU and USD announced on 
Jan. 19 that the XIV Dalai Lama Tenzin 
Gyatso will come to San Diego for a two-day 
symposium on April 18 and 19. 

UCSD Executive Vice Chancellor Suresh 
Subramani, San Diego State University 
Provost Nancy Martin and USD Provost Julie 
Sullivan assembled at the Manchester Grand 
Hyatt San Diego for a news conference to 
announce the Dalai Lama’s spring visit. 
While the Dalai Lama has traveled to more 
than 62 countries, this will be his first trip 

to San Diego.
The two-day symposium, entitled 

“Compassion Without Borders,” consists of 
three public events. The symposium was 
arranged by faculty members from the three 
participating universities in the form of 
organizing, public relations and fundraising 
committees. 

Funds raised through sponsorships and 
ticket sales will be used to cover the expense 
of the events.   Because the Dalai Lama 
does not charge a speaking engagement fee 
and will not profit financially off of the 
visit, surplus funds from the event will be 
donated to charitable organizations under 

the advisement of the spiritual leader. 
UCSD will host the first event on April 18 

at 9:30 a.m. at RIMAC arena. The Dalai Lama 
will mediate a panel discussion entitled, 
“The Global Impact of Climate Change: 
Balance through Universal Responsibility, 
Compassion and Human Consciousness.” 
Subramani, Scripps Institute of Oceanography 
Research professor Richard Somerville and 
UCSD Professor of Atmospheric and Climate 
Sciences Veerabhadran Ramanathan will 
comprise the panel.

David J. Peterson is good at what he does.That’s why the former UCSD graduate student beat 
out 40 other professionals to snag a highly 
coveted role in the production of HBO’s

His job: to create a functional, legitimate 
language for a tribe of nomadic horse-
lords called the Dothraki. It would be a 
tough job for any language creationist, 
but it’s made even more difficult by the 
fact that the original book series canon 
was so small — author George R.R.

Police Use Batons and Riot Guns to Control Crowds at Regents Meeting Protest at UCR

session, 18 of the students linked arms and invited 
the regents to hold a general assembly with them. 
The regents quickly walked out of the room before 
the students had finished speaking. Lansing 
stayed for a few more minutes to speak to the 
general assembly. She said their disruption had 
hindered the regents’ ability to devote attention to 
university problems. 

Lansing also asked the police to clear the room 
of the protestors. Several feet away, about 30 
police officers surrounded the protestors.

“Sherry left after her comment, and it just 
showed that the regents really had no intention 
of listening to student voices,” Ghandehari said. 
“And that when confronted with an actual public 
forum and an actual opening of dialogue they 
decided to leave — they actually conducted their 
meeting in another room and closed that meeting 
to the public.”

The protestors continued their meeting for 45 
minutes, discussing their potential solutions for 
creating revenue, including a general agreement 
that they endorsed the millionaire tax initiative.

Ghandehari said it was important that students 
realize that tuition increases are unrestricted 
funds.

“What happens then is that these increases can 
be spent on increasing administrator salaries — 
for example — what happened at the last regents 
meeting,” Ghandehari said. “They increased the 

salaries of top administrators at the UCs who 
were already making over $250,000 a year and 
they used our tuition money to do that because it’s 
unrestricted funds.” 

Outside of the HUB where the meeting was 
being held, 200 student protestors blocked the 
building entrances to stop the regents from 
prematurely exiting. Warren College third year 
David Aronson said there were police lines 
everywhere.

“I’ve never seen so many cops at a protest in 
my entire life,” Marshall College fourth year Iris 
Loughran said.

The sheriffs arrived with more officers at 1 
p.m.

“Because of the sheriff ’s arrival, we followed 
them to the new police line like we had done for 
every other police line, and I guess this line was 
not prepared for us,” Aronson said. “They just 
began attacking students.” 

The officers used batons and riot guns that 
were firing paintball rounds.

“The police responded pretty brutally,” 
Loughran said. “I saw one cop, he had his hand 
on the trigger the entire time.”   

After watching the Berkeley and Davis protests, 
the UC Riverside coalition came prepared for 
police violence. They brought shields to protect 
themselves. Loughran said the police tried to 
break through the protestors but were unable to 
because of the shields.

Protestors blocked the campus roadway when 
university and regents staff tried to leave for the 
day. Some even climbed on top of cars to prevent 
the regents from leaving.

Officials waited for two hours to avoid 
confrontation. 

The police had to escort the staff out on 
foot through the exit with the least amount 
of protestors gathered. They had the hold area 
blocked off and vans were waiting to take the 
regents back to their hotels.

Two demonstrators were arrested for crossing 
police lines.   A few officers maintained minor 
injuries from protest signs.

Protestors were primarily concerned with 
accountability and representation on Jan. 19. 

The topic was the main concern during the 
public comment session in the morning and the 
general assembly that followed.

“If you look at the regents, you’ll see that many 
of them are super rich, hedge-fund owners of 
real estate companies and that they really have 
no credentials in education or the administration 
of education whatsoever,” Ghandehari said. 
“Why should we expect that these regents, that 
these top administrators are actually going to 
represent students and workers and faculty at our 
university?”

UCSD Student Leaders to Organize March and May Rallies 

Dalai Lama to Give Public Speech at UCSD, USD and SDSU

something valuable from 
their conversation on global 
climate change and the need for 
humanitarian values and universal 
responsibility in recognizing and 
responding to the impacts of 
this change on communities and 
ecosystems,” Subramani said in the 
Jan. 19 press release statement.

On April 18 at 1:30 p.m., the 
Dalai Lama will give a public speech 
at USD entitled, “Cultivating Peace 
and Justice.” At this event, USD 
will award the Dalai Lama with the 
University of San Diego Medal of 

Peace. 
“The Dalai Lama’s public talk, 

Cultivating Peace and Justice, will 
address the struggles facing our 
world due to escalated violence in 
society and among nations,” USD 
Provost Julie Sullivan said in the 
Jan. 19 press release. “His Holiness 
will explore alternatives to violence 
and the shared core human values 
that can lead the way to peace, 
justice and happiness.”

The Dalai Lama’s last public 
speech, entitled, “Upholding 
Universal Ethics and Compassion 
in Challenging Times,” will take 
place at San Diego State on April 19 

at 9:30 a.m. 
“We look forward to hearing 

His Holiness’s views on upholding 
ethics, practicing forgiveness and 
tolerance and coping with the 
challenges found in today’s society,” 
San Diego State Provost Nancy 
Marlin said in the Jan. 19 press 
release.

Starting Feb. 22 at 10 a.m., 
UCSD students will have the 
opportunity to purchase tickets to 
the panel discussion, taking place 
in RIMAC Arena.

on Jan. 17. She said she intends to 
meet with students from all UC 
campuses in order to insure student 
participation in May’s rally. 

Sixth College junior and activist 
Sean Estelle said that students from 
the Public Education Coalition are 
meeting Monday to discuss logistics 
for the Week of Action, planned for 
March 1-5. According to Estelle, 
organizers will also discuss the 
possibility of arranging at UCSD 
presence at the May rally.

“We are by no means the only 
organizers,” Estelle said in an email. 

“There are many different orgs, 
groups and coalitions that will be 
dedicating their time and effort to 
this, I’m sure.”

Estelle said he wasn’t able to talk 
to Lansing when he went to UCR for 
the Regents’ Jan. 18 meeting.

“I was listening on a speaker 
outside until the meeting got shut 
down, though,” Estelle said. “She 
did not sound happy at the public 
input.”

The UC system faced $750 
million in state budget cuts during 
the 2011-12 fiscal year — a 25 
percent decrease from last year, 
according to the article, “UC 

Merced Officials Hope Capitol Rally 
Will Move Legislators,” published 
Jan. 18 in the Sacramento Bee.

“One thing I’m convinced 
of is that we all want the same 
things for UC, whether you’re a 
student, a parent, a faculty or staff 
member, an alumnus or a regent,” 
Lansing said. “We all want high-
quality and accessible academic 
programs, modern libraries and 
research facilities, safe and inviting 
campuses, good student services 
and affordable tuition.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JANUARY 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

There are many things wrong with Microsoft’s newly-patented GPS add-on. 
One of its biggest problems stems from its 
unofficial name — the “Avoid the Ghetto App.” 
The add-on is harmful because it reinforces 
assumptions about crime and race that are not 
true — something that is a product of the way 
crime statistics are calculated.

Several third-party studies conducted in 
the 1990s and the 2000s found that both of 
the major crime statistics gathering programs, 
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), and the 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 
were susceptible to significant racial biases. 
The kinds of crime that are committed in 
mostly-white, middle-class neighborhoods are 
vastly different from the kinds committed in 
poor minority neighborhoods. Both the NCVS 
and the UCR focus solely on urban and street 
crimes. This focus causes them to over-represent 
crime rates in poor urban neighborhoods — 
which, incidentally, is where African-Americans 
tend to live.

Reliance upon crime statistics that have 
known racial biases will only strengthen long-
standing assumptions about the interrelationship 
of race and crime. Though the idea that one’s 
racial makeup can somehow predict one’s 
propensity for crime has been roundly dismissed 
by the scientific community, it is difficult to 
remove from popular discourse. 

The Ghetto App is a step backward in race 
relations in that it supports the idea that certain 
neighborhoods are to be avoided entirely 
because they are fundamentally unsafe. It 
oversimplifies the reality of crime distribution 
by glossing over the long history that has created 
today’s demographic conditions, as well as the 
fact that these conditions continue to change.

QUICK TAKES MICROSOFT RECENTLY FILED A PATENT FOR A NEW GPS FEATURE, NICKNAMED THE  “GHETTO APP,” THAT  DIRECTS USERS AWAY FROM CRIME-RIDDEN AREAS.

A new app by Microsoft helps drivers bypass high crime rate areas. 
Some people are worried the app will use 

racial stereotypes to identify unsafe towns, and 
have nicknamed the app “Avoid the Ghetto 
App.” 

Sarah Chinn, author of Technology and the 
Logic of American Racism, even goes so far as 
to claim that this application uses statistics in 
a way that defines danger in terms of race and 
class identity. However, Microsoft reserves the 
right to put a product on the marketplace for 
the use of others, no matter what flaws it may 
have.

According to the United States Supreme 
Court, Microsoft has the right to sell 
controversial products, despite public outcry. 
In 2011, the Supreme Court struck down 
a California law that would have banned 
selling “violent” video games to children. 
Justice Antonin Scalia explained that the law 
overstepped the First Amendment rights of 
people who think violent video games are a 
harmless pastime.

 Consistency demands that Microsoft’s app 
also be protected under the First Amendment, 
since some people may view “ghetto” cites as 
dangerous.  People that dislike the app don’t 
have to use it.

Microsoft may not have the perfect 
strategy for driver safety, but imperfection is 
not grounds to remove a product from the 
marketplace. 

Ultimately, the consumers who purchase the 
applications need to use their own discernment 
in purchasing products. The general public is 
at liberty to view the Microsoft app as a racist 
social commentary or simply as a helpful 
device.

Microsoft’s “Pedestrian Route Production” patent presents the next step in navigation 
system technology, creating routes that keep 
people out of danger whether they are driving 
or walking. The new feature sends alerts to users 
when they are headed into neighborhoods with 
crime statistics that reach below a predetermined 
safety threshold. The app is a smart addition to 
the market, as it would keep unwitting tourists 
— as well as people who are merely venturing 
outside of their local topography — at ease while 
out on the town.

Although derisively dubbed the “Avoid the 
Ghetto app,” its purpose is far more complex. 
The feature collects and analyzes data from crime 
statistics, weather reports and maps to create 
routes away from unsafe neighborhoods, bad 
weather and difficult terrain. The app furthermore 
takes rape statistics into account, making the 
feature especially useful for women who are 
traveling alone. This would also quell parents’ 
worries when their newly-licensed teenage drivers 
are out maneuvering the streets on their own. 

The app is designed to also help unsuspecting 
tourists avoid questionable neighborhoods, a 
feature that would have saved the lives of British 
tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris. 
In April 2011, the two vacationers were shot 
and killed while walking back to their hotel in 
Sarasota, Florida. Being unfamiliar with the 
streets, they strayed into the city’s Newton district 
— which is infamous for its high rate of violent 
gang activity, drug-dealing and rape. With this 
new GPS app, instances like this can be avoided.

The pedestrian-friendly app guides users away 
from high-crime areas, just as do other apps for 
highway construction or traffic jams. With this 
feature, accidentally wandering into the “sketch” 
areas of town can become a fear of the past.

GPS Could Save Unaware Travelers New App is too Broad and InaccurateMicrosoft Reserves Right to Sell App

Like everyone else, I like to be right — but in a sickening twist on this universal desire, 
I especially like to be right about my 
(many) pessimistic predictions. �us, 
I felt both gleeful and grim upon 
discovering research supporting a 
comment I made years ago about how 
“Breakfast Club” is a lie and my time at 
UCSD would not consist of connecting 
with fascinating strangers. 

�e year was 2009, and my long-
su�ering best friend, trying to make 

me feel better about being headed 
to UCSD, remarked that our 30,000 
enrollment would expose me to new 
and interesting friends. Nope, I replied, 
I hated parties. I was scared of people. 
I would not meet “lots of di�erent 
people” at a big school. 

Sheer experience has proven my 
theory  true, as I spend 90 percent 
of my time with the same group of 
stressed-out Vonnegut lovers who 
won’t stop playing Sporcle games.

But it’s not just me; Ingram and 
Morris at Columbia University used 
electronic name tags to track the 
conversation at a mixer, and concluded 
that people do not mix. No matter how 
much people claimed that they were 
there to “meet new people,” they ended 
up talking to people they already 
knew, or those who are most similar, 
especially in terms of occupation. 
In other words, I shouldn’t expect 
that my experience at a kickback on 
Saturday — during which I spent most 
of the time talking to the one friend I 
brought — will change as I enter the 
work force. Ten years from now, I will 
attend professional mixers and the 
main di�erence will be the height of 
my heels and the length of my skirt.

�ough this phenomenon is 
depressingly consistent across the 
population, research by Bahns, 
Pickett and Crandall at the University 
of Kansas shows that UCSD’s large 
enrollment actually makes it easier 
for us to stay socially isolated. Bahns 
et. al approached random students at 
�ve schools — the 25,000-enrollment 
University of Kansas, and four rural 
colleges with a median enrollment 
of 525 — to ask about their beliefs, 
politics and social networks. �ey 
found that the larger the school, the 
more likely each person was to have 
extremely similar friends. Small 
colleges force people to be friends 
with, essentially, whomever is around, 
and these friendships are closer and 
last longer despite the di�erences. 
In contrast, those at the University 
of Kansas, and us here at UCSD, 
use the choices o�ered by the large 
populations to �nd the exact people 
who are just like us.

So it turns out that all those 
freshmen events and RA mixers 
don’t matter much, as people simply 
gravitate toward their mirrors, and 
this holds true for everything from 
high school clubs to partisan politics. 
It’s intuitive, it’s easy, but it’s also sad, 
because by staying within the same 
social circle, we’re reinforcing our 
own values, and missing out on the 
potential of what else is out there.

Gov. Jerry Brown proposed a state budget for 2012-13 containing provisions that would make Cal Grants more difficult 
to obtain for students. The most controversial 
provision is an increase in the minimum grade 
point average (GPA) requirements needed to 
qualify for two of the awards. These specific 
measures will close the budget shortfall by $131 
million dollars and there are other propositions 
aside from Cal Grants that aim to raise funding 
for higher education overall. Yet, these financial 
pros are outweighed by the decreased accessibility 
to education for underprivileged students.  

The two types of awards affected are merit-
based Cal Grant A and income-based Cal Grant 
B. The proposal would take the current GPA 
requirements for Cal Grant A and raise it from 
a 3.0 to a 3.25 and similarly raise Cal Grant B’s 
GPA requirement from a 2.0 to a 2.75. There is 
also a proposed increase to community college 
transfers’ qualifying GPA — from a 2.4 to a 2.75 
GPA.

For the upcoming fiscal year there is a 
projected $9 to $12 billion budget shortfall in 
California, so the Governor’s proposed budget 

changes are progress towards a solution. Brown 
suggested a raise in the GPA requirement to 
further ensure that grants are going to students 
most likely to earn their degree. But this measure 
could impact over 26,000 students in the UC, 
Cal State and community college levels next year. 
The alarming thing is that any GPA requirement 
changes would take place after the March 2 
deadline for financial aid. Many students would 
be awarded provisional grants, only to have them 
rescinded once the budget passed.

As more students lack the ability to pay for 
school, this could create an overflow of students 
moving from private to public universities. 
This is also due to a provision that would 
lower the award amount for students attending 
private non-profit schools to the Cal State level 
— a difference of over $4,000 dollars.  This 
measure is introduced despite the fact that on 
average in California, private universities are 
1.5 times more expensive to attend than UC 
schools and over two times more expensive 
to attend than Cal State schools. The Jan. 15 
article in the Los Angeles Times, “Budget plan

move that is not worth the disqualification of  thousands of  students.

GPA Increase Can Drive Students to Easier Majors

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I really like how the students 

were able to take back CLICS last 
quarter. CLICS has now been 
opened, with mainly volunteers 
putting forth their time and effort to 
keep the place running. CLICS had 
always been a convenient place to 
study, and now with no computers, 
it brings total silence in the area. 
It’s insanely quiet in there and I 
can actually study without being 
distracted, unlike Geisel Library.

I feel irked to read in the most 
recent article about the A.S. Council 
opting to turn CLICS into a lecture 
hall-like style. A.S. Council, when 
did you actually care about the well-
being of CLICS? I give you some 
credit for putting forth the effort in 
trying to save it. But it was mainly 
the students who took the initiative 
to reclaim it for their own studying 
purpose during finals week.

As quoted from the article, 
“The meeting closed with Wing’s 
unveiling of the first draft of the new 
CLICS facility. The layout includes 
a large lecture hall in the middle, 
an entryway with standing work 
bars similar to those in Price Center 
East and three study areas to hold 
approximately 130 seats.”

Excuse me? CLICS was closed 
down because the school couldn’t 
afford to keep it running, and A.S. 
council is suggesting we add stuff to 
the so-called “new CLICS facility?”

When did CLICS become a new 
facility? When did people suddenly 
show interest in renovating CLICS 
after it closed down? Oh yeah, when 
students actually took action. While 
going for Division I sports? In a time 
where student costs are rising? That’s 
A.S. Council for you.

You can totally count my vote 
for Division I sports, I would love 
to someday have an additional $500 
added to my billing statement just so 
I can brag to the world that UCSD 
is in the level of UCLA and Cal. I 
totally agree that the reason why 
there is less school spirit is because 
we don’t have a football team. 
Because sports clearly make the 
difference, not one’s mindset.

We are all here in this school for 
a reason, to succeed personally and 
contribute to the greater good of our 
future and community. Not to say 
we got a fancy library and that our 
school is in Division I sports.

I wish A.S. Council would stop 
focusing on such trivial matters and 
genuinely care about the students.

would raise the bar for Cal Grant financial aid” reports that 
this could “drastically reduce opportunities for low-income 
students who are accepted by private schools” and that if 
these students opted to go to public schools instead, that 
“state expenses could increase” in order to subsidize those 
students. If state expenses did increase, then more cuts in 
education would inevitably follow, creating a destructive 
pattern that harms students. 

Not only will these requirements create a sense of 
uncertainty, but they will also have an effect on students 
who are already struggling to overcome the achievement 
gap. This might force students to either drop out of school 
or choose majors that are less competitive in order to 
maintain a high GPA. Kevin Rask, an economics professor 
at Wake Forest University, reviewed the records of over 
5,000 students who graduated from an unnamed “elite” 
liberal arts college from 2001 to 2009 and found that 

the age-old humanities-slacker myth is true — some 
majors yield higher average GPAs than others. Chemistry 
and math majors have a GPA average of 2.78 and 2.90 
respectively while education and English majors have 
a GPA average at 3.36 and 3.33 respectively. These new 
changes could force desperate STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Mathematics) majors into majors that they 
would otherwise not consider just so that they could afford 
a degree.   

The government needs revenue, therefore the state 
should continue with Brown’s other proposed measures 
such as an increase in sales tax and tax on high-earning 
Californians which the state claims will increase funding to 
higher education by 4 percent a year. However, those who 
are underprivileged and pursuing an education should be 
put first, thus student funds are not where cuts should be 
made.

Words of  Honor

UNCOMMON FOLK

While the “Dothraki” may just be a made-up tribe from “Game of  
Thrones,” UCSD’s DAV I D  J .  P E T E R S O N  speaks their language.

Dothraki words. 
But Peterson’s experience speaks for itself. 

As an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, he first 
found his foothold in linguistics while taking 
several language courses including Russian 
and Arabic. It was there he discovered the 
small but exciting field of language creation 
and created the first language and writing 
system of his own, based roughly on Arabic. 

“And I went from there, and I’ve been at it 
ever since,” Peterson said.

After undergrad, Peterson applied to 
graduate schools in linguistics — UC Santa 
Barbara and UCSD in particular. But before 
he even received a response from either, 
Peterson was contacted by Eric Bakovic, a 
professor of linguistics at UCSD, who pre-
sented him with a very attractive offer.

“[He] contacted me and said that he was 
trying to get a class funded that would be 
introductory linguistics through the medium 
of language creation,” Peterson said. “And I 
was like, holy smokes.” 

He didn’t need to think twice — and 
chose UCSD.

Peterson was drawn to UCSD in par-
ticular because of the warm attitude the 
linguistics department had toward the field 
of language creation, a field often scoffed at 
by linguist colleagues.

“There are linguists who look down on 

people who create languages as being frivo-
lous, as being crazy,” Peterson said. “One of 
the things that was so nice about the UCSD 
linguistics department was that everyone 
there was completely supportive. This was an 
extremely lovely environment.”

Peterson credits what he calls a “trans-
formative” graduate morphology class with 
professor Farrell Ackerman for his language 
creation skills. In fact, he felt 
that the class was so impor-
tant that he took it twice, 
passing both times.

“It’s going to sound sort 
of cliche, but there is one 
professor [at UCSD] that 
completely changed the 
way I looked at language 
thereafter and fundamen-
tally changed the way I went 
about creating languages,” 
he said. 

But Peterson’s interest 
and dedication in language 
creation wasn’t bound to the 
classroom. During his time 
at UCSD, he also helped 
found an online language 
community in the form of 
an email listserv. The “con-lang” list — 
named as a shortened version of the phrase 
“constructed languages” — consisted of a 
vibrant and active community that grew 
formidably.

Peterson also helped create the Language 
Creation Society in 2006, which later 

branched off into a Language Creation 
Conference, held in Berkeley in 2007. 

“It was a place where we got a bunch of 
people together who liked creating languages 
in a conference-style setting, where we could 
present feature length presentations about 
things in the field of language creation, help 
out the community, things like that,” he said.

It was his pursuits outside of the class-
room that landed Peterson yet another, 
even more attractive offer. “Game of 
Thrones” producers Dan Weiss and 
David Benioff contacted the Language 
Creation Society, looking for some-
one to create a language to help add 
another level of authenticity to the 
show. Happy to oblige, and not about 
to pass up the chance of a lifetime, the 
Language Creation Society quickly got 
organized and set up a definitive appli-
cation process. They spread the word 
to several listservs and bulletin boards, 
including an Auxlang mailing list, 
an Elfling mailing list and a Zompist 
Bulletin Board and, in the end, the 
pool of applicants swelled to 40. 

According to Peterson, the applica-
tion process was rather simple. Each 
applicant was expected to submit a 

proposal as to how they would go about 
creating a Dothraki language. A panel of 
respected language creators who chose not 
to apply served as the judges, and the entire 
process was double blinded. After the first

INFOCUS CONTXT WEIGHT LOSS STUDY

T hat little device you carry around with you at all times — which has already replaced your wrist-watch, your teddy 
bear and your address book — may very 
well replace your nutritionist in the near 
future, if all goes well with studies being con-
ducted by the ConTxt research group. Cell 
phone usage is the center of the researchers’ 
unique weight loss plan, and they’re cur-
rently searching for subjects to participate in 
a 12-month study that will ideally result in 
the participants reaching a healthier weight. 

The study aims to create a personalized 
diet and exercise plan that will be monitored 
through a system of automated text mes-
sages sent to subjects about four times daily. 
These messages will include a balance of 
motivational topics such as health tips and 
recipes, as well as questions about the sub-
ject’s caloric intake, activity level for the day 
and step count. The subjects will check in 
with the program’s in-office health coaches 
three times during the study so that they may 
record their progress.

The developers believe that consistent 
accountability, which will increase awareness 
of one’s habits, will make achieving weekly 
goals reasonable for everyone. They have 
been working for several years to create a 
highly detailed and efficient way of random-
izing the messages, while at the same time 
tailoring their trajectory according to the 
specific received responses from the subject. 

The project is funded by the National 
Cancer Institute and has been evolv-
ing for several years at the Cal Institute 
for Telecommunications and Information 
Technology based in UCSD’s Atkinson Hall. 
It began with the foundation study conduct-
ed by principle investigator, Kevin Patrick. 
Finding that the main barrier to living a 
healthy lifestyle is a lack of access to resourc-
es and information, he and his co-founders 

wanted to find a single platform to reach as 
many people as possible — and they found 
the key right at their fingertips. 

“We know that cell phones are some-
thing that cross social strata — poor or rich 
people have cell phones,” Acting Interim 
Study Coordinator Angelica Barrera-Ng 
said. “Everyone has this at their reach as 
opposed to personal consultants which cost 
more resources. We will provide them with 
motivational tips, easy and practical, that are 
incremental in a noninvasive way.”

To ensure the program is universally 
efficient while remaining specific to each 
individual, the developers must take into 
consideration a variety of differences that 
must be addressed in the text messages. This 
may include presenting the information in 
a different way or altering a separate selec-
tion of recipes in order to address the social 
circumstances that differ from an English 
speaker. All of these details are directly in 
line with ConTxt Coach’s hypothesis that 
health is not only an issue concerning biol-
ogy, but that the main factor to a plan’s suc-
cess is its relevance and workability into one’s 
specific lifestyle. 

However, they are fully willing to take 
on this challenge if the study proves to be 
a success. 

“With any public healthy study, there is 
always that ultimate goal of extending it to 
the general public,” Barrera-Ng said. “We are 
working for them, and simply want to coun-
terbalance and attack this wide problem of 
obesity. Hopefully someday we may imple-
ment it somehow into public policy, but for 
now we just want to see what happens with 
the study.”

CONTRIBUTING WRITER

round, the pool was narrowed down to five 
applications — Peterson’s included. Following 
a second round of revisions and input from the 
producer of the show, Peterson’s application 
was chosen. 

Surprisingly, Peterson actually hadn’t been 
a fan of the series before landing this job.

“I had heard of it, but I hadn’t actually read 
the books before,” he said. “Now I’ve read up 
to Book Five. I’m a big fan.”

Though the series had a limited view of 
the Dothraki language (the books only pro-
vided about 30 or so existing Dothraki words), 
Peterson still relied heavily on the books 
in order to understand the Dothraki world, 
which would in turn help him develop a 
cohesive language. From the books, Peterson 
gleaned inferences to the Dothraki experience, 
from their way of travel (marching distance by 
horseback) and the types of flora and fauna 
they encountered, to their surroundings (the 
Dothraki sea is literally waves upon waves of 
grain). 

“George R. R. Martin puts a lot of detail 
into his work,” he said. “I had to figure out 
what it was supposed to be like, to live like a 
Dothraki person, and to flesh out the vocabu-
lary that way.” 

Part of understanding the Dothraki life-
style includes understanding exactly what 
they do or don’t experience. For instance, the 
Dothraki would not understand a word like 
“armor,” because the concept of protective 
covering is entirely foreign to them — the 

Dothraki do not intend to get hit. 
The Dothraki’s lack of literature is also 

an example of this.  Though they have a 
rather extensive spoken language system, the 
Dothraki have no sort of written form of the 
language, yet Peterson did eventually come up 
with a word for “write,” a modification of the 
preexisting word “to tattoo.”

“It was all kind of a learning process, where 
you really kind of forget what you have in your 
own culture and think about what it would be 
like if this was what you had, if this was what 
your life was, if all of these concepts were for-
eign,” he said.

As for real world language influences, 
Peterson mainly drew from Russian and 
Swahili. Russian influences shaped the way 
the Dothraki language worked — Peterson 
especially liked the lack of articles and the fact 
that the basic feminine noun form is actually a 
plural. And while the sound and shape of the 
words were formed by the preexisting words 
in Martin’s books, the grammar was actually 
influenced by Swahili and Zhyler, a language 
Peterson had created earlier. 

Currently, the Dothraki language’s word 
count totals nearly 3,262, with more to surely 
arrive as Season 2 progresses. When asked if 
a possible Dothraki-English dictionary was 
in the works, Peterson was more than open 
to the idea.

“If there is a publisher interested, we’re 
available, I’ll just say that.”

10  THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JANUARY 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSD-

relief for senior forward Christian Hatch, who 
was playing with an injured wrist. Sophomore 
guard MacKenzie McCullough — replacing 
junior Ryan Peters, who suffered from a con-
cussion in the previous game against Monterey 
Bay — also played well down the stretch, scor-
ing eight points while pulling down a team-
high seven rebounds and two assists. 

Once more, in the waning minutes the 
Tritons looked to Brue and 
McCann, who had 13 and 
18 points, respectively. Brue 
pulled down seven rebounds 
to match McCullough, 
while McCann threw three 
assists to make the score 
60-50 with just under 
three minutes left to play.  
       With a 10-point cushion, 
the Tritons relaxed, allowing 
the Seawolves to cut the lead 
down to one with 24 seconds 
remaining. 

In their one-point loss 
last weekend, the Tritons let 
slip another 10-point lead 
with mere seconds remain-
ing on the clock. 

But this time, McCann hit his free throws to 
put the Tritons out of harm’s reach as they took 
the 63-62 victory.

Saturday against Humboldt State, the 
Tritons took the early lead going 16-13 after 
the first 10 minutes of play. 

But showing fatigue, Carlson fell to digging 
into his bench. With McGrath the only starter 
left on the floor, the Lumberjacks took the lead 
and never looked back, taking advantage of the 
flagging Triton starters and the inexperienced 
Triton bench to take a 25-34 lead. 

Humboldt relied heavily on their post-play, 
with 6’9” 265 lb junior center Matt Lipski tak-
ing up space in the key, limiting the effective-
ness of both Hatch and Wheeler, who had only 
four points and one point, respectively. Four 
of the starting five for the Lumberjacks were 
taller than 6’5”, with the exception of 5’5” point 
guard D.J. Broome. 

Hulking 6’9” Lumberjack guard Kyle Baxter 
scored a game high 23 points. With his height, 
Baxter was easily able to either post up against 
smaller guards or get around the Tritons’ slow-
er forwards. With a clean jumper to boot, 
Baxter was clearly the best player on the floor.  
    With 15 minutes left in the game, the Jacks 
still held an 11-point advantage, leading 39-50. 
But Triton shooter McGrath started lighting 
up to keep the Tritons in the game, hitting 

four three-pointers down the stretch. 
    Coming down to the wire, McGrath 
hit the three-pointer that started 
to turn the tide with five minutes 
remaining. Wheeler pulled down 
a great rebound in the next pos-
session, making way for a McCann 
three-pointer off the resulting fast 
break with two minutes remaining. 
       McGrath then hit two free 
throws, keeping the gap at four, 
until senior Mike Meza sunk a 
long corner three-pointer to bring 
the Tritons to within one point.  
       With the score 64-65, the Tritons 
had the ball with only 11 seconds 
remaining. McCann inbounded the 
ball, going coast to coast for a jumper 
with two seconds left for the win. 

The attempt rattled out, but McCullough had 
a chance to put it back up, though the shot fell 
out as the horn sounded to end the game.

“We need to work on closing games,” 
McCann said. “We lost two of our last four in 
very close games, but [we] have had good prac-
tices throughout [the past few weeks].”

In the past few games, the bright spots for 
UCSD have come from the bench, who McCann 
said, “have really stepped up, even though we 
have some guys hurt.”

“The next step is getting [a win] on the road,” 
McCann said. “We haven’t had one yet, but I’m 
really excited about this weekend’s games.”

This coming weekend the Tritons go on the 
road to face Cal Poly Pomona next Thursday, 
followed by bottom-of-the-conference, San 
Francisco State on Saturday.

Men’s Basketball Team Set to Cotinue Conference Play Next Week on the Road

2005 USES report, and was further confirmed in 
more recent student surveys conducted by A.S.  
Council. Perceived benefits include a boost in the 
pedigree of a UCSD degree, a legacy to come back 
to and greater school spirit.

The pros and cons are obvious. Opponents 
point to the cost of making the move, while 
supporters argue the tangible benefits of a 
stronger athletic department and the increased 
national visibility such competition would 
bring. The difference is all too clearly illustrated 
by the disparity between UCSD and UCLA. 
       At UCSD, groundbreaking research and 
increasingly bright undergraduates propel the 
university up college rankings, but out-of-towners 
all too often mistake us for San Diego State. 
Bruins never have to worry about ‘rebranding’ or 
being confused with Cal State Los Angeles. We are 
competitive in terms of faculty and educational 
value, but Berkeley and UCLA still top us in the 
number of applicants. 

Name recognition is the key to really impress-
ing employers. The employer’s pathological 
response to recognizing a school is, “Hey I know 
this place, I feel good about knowing it, I feel good 
about this job candidate.”    

Being a Division I school will get UCSD’s 
name out there, competing against big-name 
schools like Santa Barbara, Stanford and Cal, and 
helping the degree be perceived as worth more 
than it is at present. 
  

           What is it? 
    The initiative is for a $166 per quarter raise in 
student fees. This would bring the athletics bud-
get to around $8 million, a middle-of-the-road 
number similar to other teams in the Big West.  
    Moving to Division I is only possible if we 
have a conference. If the referendum passes, 
UCSD has until 2014 to be invited into a confer-
ence. Until then, there would be no change. 
    Once invited, UCSD will have one transition 
year before moving to Division I — a necessary 
provision considering we currently offer the min-
imum amount of scholarship money permissible 
in Division II, which is several million less than 
what is required in Division I. In this transition 
year, the student fees would allow the Tritons to 
meet the minimum Division I requirement. 
    Theoretically, the move would follow this 

timeline. After the referendum passes Winter 
Quarter of 2012, UCSD is invited to the Big West 
Spring Quarter 2013. Fees would increase for the 
2013-14 school year, in which time athletic and 
non-athletic scholarships would increase. In the 
2014-15 UCSD would compete in Division I as 
part of the Big West Conference. 
  

           Paying for It
Current freshmen will be take the brunt of 

the cost due to the likelihood is that we will not 
be invited to the Big West for several years. In 
addition, 29 percent of all student fees return to 
finanical aid.

  
           Are we ready?
The baseball field needs lights and flush-

ing toilets, but other than that and a few other 
small projects, the UCSD facilities are already 
better than all the other teams in the Big West. 
RIMAC’s indoor facility and our track are far 
better than anyone else except for San Diego 
State’s basketball arena, for obvious reasons. 
Repairs to current facilities are already under-
way, by using purely team-by-team fundrais-
ing initiatives that cost the students nothing. 
       From a coaching standpoint, almost all 
our coaches have experience at the Division 
I level. Basketball coach Chris Carlson was 
at UCLA, Track and field coaches Tony 
Salerno and Darcy Ahner were at Air Force 
and Arizona, respectively, and most other 
coaches are already at the Division I level, 
like the head women’s and men’s swimming 
coaches Corrie Falcon and Matt Macedo. 
    UCSD has outgrown the level of competition 
of other CCAA schools. We dominate in most 
Division II sports we take part in, despite the 
fact that we are at the minimum level for athletic 
scholarships in Division II, against fully funded 
D-2 programs. UCSD won the Chancellor’s Cup 
—  given to the school that the most conference 
titles and accolades of any school — four of the 
last five years. 

    If the referendum doesn’t pass, UCSD will 
probably never go Division I.

“This referendum is vital to our success in 
the future,” Athletic Director Earl Edwards said. 
If the referendum is blocked, the Big West will 
be even less inclined to consider UCSD.

Tritons Take Back-to-Back Weekend Wins Against Sonoma State and Humboldt

NOLAN THOMAS/GUARDIAN
Bottom left: Senior guard Daisy Feder led the Tritons in scoring in their games against Sonoma State on Friday, and Humboldt State on Saturday.

UCSD’s precision shooting 
proved crucial in the win against the 
Seawolves, with nine of the Tritons’ 
next 11 points coming from behind 
the arc and 10 three-pointers to 
Sonoma’s two.

As has been the pattern for the 
majority of the Tritons’ matches thus 
far, UCSD flourishes in the second 
half, capitalizing on its opponents’ 
tired legs. The closest the Seawolves 
would come to the Tritons for the 
remainder was 11 points. Although 
both Elliott and Feder felt that the 
defense on the night wasn’t up to par, 
UCSD found a way around it by con-
tinuing to run the court.

“[Sonoma’s] very well-coached,” 
Elliott said. “They tried to slow the 
game down, and play a half-court 
game. But we kept pushing tempo 
and I felt like our transitioning made 
the difference.” 

Junior guard Emily Osga ended 
the night with 19 points and six 
assists. Senior guard Chelsea Carlisle 
— who was named the CCAA player 
of the week for the second time in the 
2012 season — recorded 17 points 
along with an even more impres-
sive 12 assists. The two-time All-
American leads the conference in 
dishes, with 117 in conference play. 

With their perfect season intact, 
the No. 1 Tritons faced fourth in 
conference Humboldt State on 
Saturday, Jan. 21. UCSD outscored 
the Lumberjacks 13-4 at the start. 
With a 13-point cushion by the sev-
en-minute mark, Elliott brought on 
her reserves. Humboldt capitalized, 
going on a 7-0 run before the half, 
leaving the score at 30-25 by the end 
of the period. 

At the start of the second peri-
od, Humboldt’s Bree Halsey — who 
recorded a game-high of 16 rebounds 
— picked up a quick steal, which 
was converted by forward Whitney 

Howard. With the game tied at 30, 
the Tritons reclaimed the lead with 
a clutch three-pointer from Carlisle. 

The Lumberjacks remained close 
for the next few possessions, as both 
squads decided to press high. But 
as the game wore on, the Humboldt 
defense began to deteriorate and the 
Tritons were able to pick apart the 
holes for a few easy buckets.

“In the second half, we started 
picking things up defensively,” Elliott 
said. “I started making a few substi-
tutions. [Natalie Luzar] came in and 
gave us a tremendous spark at the 
time. [Humboldt] missed a couple 
shots and we did a great job of transi-
tioning to get a couple easy baskets.”

The Tritons ran away with the 
lead, going on a 25-4 run to end the 
game. The Lumberjacks weren’t able 
to muster a response and finished the 
night with 19 turnovers on 28.5 per-
cent shooting. The Tritons went 45.3 
percent from the field and recorded 
six of their 10 three-pointers in the 
second half for a sublime 60 percent 
from behind the arc. 

UCSD was dangerous all over the 
court, as four Tritons recorded in 
double figures. Feder led all-scorers 
with 20 points on nine rebounds. 
Carlisle contributed 14 points, soph-
omore forward Erin Dautremont 
chipped in 13 points and senior for-
ward Lauren Freidenberg recorded 
10 points. 

The Tritons now head on the 
road to take on Cal Poly Pomona on 
Thursday, Jan. 26 and San Francisco 
State on Saturday, Jan. 28. 

“We finished the first half of con-
ference, we’re 0-0 now, that needs to 
be our mindset,” Elliott said. “We got 
to go on the road and we’ve got to 
try and steal them, because no one’s 
going to give you a game on the road.”

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JANUARY 23,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 12

After a total of 18 games, facing all 12 CCAA conference teams, the Tritons remain undefeated 
in their 2012 season. With an 18-0 
record, UCSD was named the No. 1 
team in Division II Women’s Basketball 
for the first time in school history.

“It’s just a testament to these kids 
and the effort that they’ve been put-
ting out every single day,” head coach 
Charity Elliott said. “But tonight we 
learned that it’s never going to be easy.”

On Friday, UCSD met with 
5-9 Sonoma State at home. The 
Seawolves, who allow a conference 
low of 53.9 points per game, raced 
out to the lead at the start of the half.  
    Sonoma kept the advantage midway 
into the first half — leading by as many 
as six points — until back-to-back 
three pointers from freshman sixth 
man Natalie Luzar and senior shooting 
guard Daisy Feder tied the game. 

With seven minutes remaining in 
the half, Elliott brought her starters 
back onto the court, who scrapped 
together a three-point lead by the end 
of the half. 

With a slight three-point margin, 
the Tritons went on a 7-0 run off of five 
consecutive points from Feder, who 
led UCSD with 23 points on the night. 

UCSD had a difficult time pen-
etrating into the key, as Sonoma’s 
forwards dominated on the blocks, 
recording 17 second chance buckets to 
UCSD’s six. Nonetheless, the Tritons 
did well to adjust by picking up their 
points from the perimeter. 

“It was frustrating, because we 
wanted to get the ball inside and 
Sonoma plays a sagging defense, so 
that made it a little more difficult,” 
Feder said.

Midway into this quarter, you, the student 
body, will be voting on the initiative to move 
UCSD to Division I. 

It’s a move that could be financially burden-
some to an already heavily taxed student body. 
But the move will have only positive effects for 
the university. 

The initiative began in the A.S. Council as a 
response to student requests dating back to the

Men’s Basketball Tops Sonoma, Falls to Humboldt
BY NICK HOWE 
Associate Sports Editor

MEN’S BASKETBALL
   The Triton Men’s Basketball 
team came off this weekend 
in the same position as the 
week before, going from 2-7 to 
3-8 over the weekend. UCSD 
remains third from the last in 
the CCAA’s 12-team 
league.  
    Friday’s game 
against Sonoma State 
began poorly for 
the Tritons as the 
Seawolves’ freshman 
Justin Herold ran 
backside and caught 
an alley-oop, slam-
ming over two Triton defend-
ers for the opening points of 
the game. The Tritons traded 
points in the following posses-
sion, attacking Sonoma’s 2-3 
zone defense with an overload 
offense.

Six of the first eight 
Seawolves’ points came from 
above the rim, as the Tritons 
struggled to defend the more 
athletic Sonoma squad, with 
the Seawolves surging ahead 
2-7 in the first two minutes. 

UCSD adjusted, locking 
down the low post and forcing 
Sonoma to take lower percent-

age outside shots. 
Senior guard 
Justin Brue and 
sophomore guard 
James McCann 
led the Tritons 
on a 13-point run 
to make it 15-7 
by the 11-minute 
mark. 

With six minutes left in the 
half, UCSD pushed forward, as 
the players gapped the Wolves 
25-13. 

The advantage pushed 
Sonoma into a full-court man 

defense in an attempt to stop 
the Triton post-play, led by 
senior forward Ryan Wheeler. 
Wheeler — who has seen a 
dramatic increase in his min-
utes in the past few games 
— played well coming off the 
bench, nabbing nine points 
and two rebounds. 

But the Tritons struggled 
to break the press and went 
scoreless to the end of the half 
(with the exception of one 
jumper from junior guard 
Tyler McGrath). After blow-
ing a 12-point lead, the Tritons 
ended the first period down 
29-26. 

In the second half, the 
Seawolves pressed on and off 
as the Tritons dropped the 
tempo and continued with 
their motion offense. Wheeler 
remained dynamic on the 
boards, as he subbed in as
