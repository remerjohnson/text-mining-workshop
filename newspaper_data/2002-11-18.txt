BRIEFLY 
UCSD ~rofessor wins Bloengmeenng AwarCi 

The Biomedical Engineering Society's 
2002 International Award was presented to 
UCSD professor of bioengineering Marcos 
Intaglietta at the society's annual meeting in 
Houston. 

The award honors Intaglietta's pioneer-
ing discoveries about how oxygen is trans-
ported through the microcirculation to the 
body's tissues. 

Among his research, which was conduct-
ed with former UCSD professor of medicine 
Robert Winslow, is the finding that blood sub-
stitutes can improve overall blood flow and 
reduce the heart's workload. They also dis-
covered that blood substitutes could be 
designed to hold oxygen in reserve, only 
releasing oxygen to those tissues that need it 

These discoveries helped explain why 
many of the blood substitutes under devel-
opment by biotechnology companies 
caused high blood pressure and other side 
effects in patients. 

Intagl ietta was also the first to develop 
testing techniques that allow researchers to 
see. measure and analyze blood flow in the 
microscopic blood vessels over time in living 
animals. His seminal 1998 paper on oxygen 
transport is counted among the top 10 of the 
IOU mal's most frequently cited engineering 
publications. according to The Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sciences. 

Throughout his career, Intaglietta has 
welcomed a constant stream of internation-
al colleagues as visiting scientists in his lab-
oratory. He has also worked with govern-
ments and health care institutions in 
Europe. Latin America and Asia to promote 

Errata ... 

the development of alternatives to blood 
transfusions. 

NPACI to present research 
at computing conference 

The National Partnership for Advanced 
Computational Infrastructure will present a 
research exhibit and related demonstrations 
at SC2oo2, the world's largest annual high-
perfonmance networking and computing 
conference, from Nov. 16 through Nov. 22 
in Baltimore. 

The NPACI exhibit booth will allow visi-
tors to explore supercomputing technology 
and the breakthroughs in science it makes 
possible, as well as participate in the com-
munity that makes up NPACI, which involves 
41 partner institutions and receives part of 
its funding from the Un iversity of california. 

Along with highlighting the accomplish-
ments of NPACI's projects, the partnership's 
booth will showcase its role in the TeraGrid, 
which will be fully deployed in 2003 as the 
world's most powerful computing infrastruc-
ture for open scientific research. 

Throughout the conference. researchers 
will demonstrate how NPACI-developed 
technology has led to major scientific suc-
cesses. such as visualizing the evolution of 
a galaxy, simulating the flow of blood 
through a heart and the creation of a 
National Virtual Observatory. 

Summaries, locations and times of all of 
the NPACI presentations and demos are 
available at http.//www.npoCl:edu/sc2002. 
More about 5(2002, which is themed 
'From Terabytes to Insights." is available at 
http.//www.sc2002.org. 

In the "Fair showcases cultural research" article of the Nov. 12 issue, there was an 
error regard ing Cindy Nam' research project. She is working with normally developing 
3- to 12-monfh old Infants as opposed to austistic infants. In the same issue, the con 
side of the 'Steering the good ship USA" Pro/Con identified Supreme Court Justices 
William Rehnquist John Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor as being appointees of 
President George HW Bush. Rehnquist was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, 
Stevens by PreSident Gerald Ford and O'Connor by Reagan. 

In the Nov. 14 issue of the Guardian, the article titiled "'Edward II' is a daring pro-
duction" wrongly identified the playas being a La Jolla Playhouse production. ~ was 
actually a prOduction of the UC5D department of theatre and dance.

LGBTA: G roup celebrates past 25 years 
cominued from 'page I 

LGBTRO Director Shaun Travers 
explained that the LGBTA serves as a hub for 
communication within the campus communi-
ty. 

"The nonsexist dance is one of the biggest 
things the LGBTA does for the community," 
Travers said. 

T he nonsexist dances and the resource 
office, Travers sa id, "provide a safe environ-
ment for the youth of the San Diego commu-
nity." 

Also in attendance were members of the 
newly formed Alliance, the group that trains 
students of any sex:ual orientation how to sup-
port and stand up for those around them who 
arc of a different sexual orientation. 

"It's a place for people from the LGBTA 
and those who are not to voice their opin-

ions," said Kristine Quiroz, a senior at 
Eleanor Roosevelt College. 

Another program the LG BTA organizes 
every year is Queer Camp. Queer Camp is a 
program for incoming freshman to get to 
know other srudents who have come out with 
their sexual orientation. 

A raffle was held throughout the evening 
for gift baskets put together by different cam-
pus organizations such as the Cross-Cultural 
Center and the Women's Center. 

As for the future plans of the LGBTA :1I1d 
the Resource Center, Travers said he hope 
for another 25 years of continuing work for 
the group and its mission. 

"It would be nice to see a more open cam-
pus," said Earl Warren College senior 1(,dd 
Tolin. "A.S. is doing a wonderhtl job or help-
ing to make that happen."

David Rockefeller visits UCSD 
Revelle Forum invites famous heir for lecture 

By DANIEL WAnS 
Senior Staff Writer 

David Rockefeller, grandson of 
the late 19th-cennlry oil magnate 
John D. Rockefeller, visited UCSD' 
Neurosciences Instinltc on Nov. 13 
for a public interview with UCSD 
history profes or Michael E. Parrish. 

Sponsored by the Revelle 
Forum Lecture Series. the inter-
view consisted of an informal con-
versation with Parrish to be broad-
casted on UCSD-TV T he dialogue 
focused on Rockefeller's autobio-
graphical book, "Memoirs," but the 
su bsequent question-and -answer 
session touched upon topics rang-
ing from a looming war in Iraq to 
the reconstruction of New York 
City after 9/ I J. 

The original reason for building 
the World Trade Center was to stop 
an exodus of companies from lower 
Manhattan by convincing them to 
stay in the area, Rockefeller said. 

"What is needed [after Sept. 11] 
is a study of lower Manhattan 
today," he said. " I suspect they will 
recommend combining new office 
space with more livi ng space. 
Having a 24-hour-a-day communi-
ty would make [Manhattan] 
stronger. [t wouldn't make sense to 
simply rebuild the towers." 

Other questions submitted by 
some of the about 120 audience 
members concerned Rockefeller's 
repeated refusals to hold public 
oil Ice. Rockefeller was offered the 
POSI of secretary of the treasury by 
three different U.S. presidents, and 
was once offered the posi tion of 
chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board. 

Rockefeller said he could effect 

change more effectively through 
the private sector than through the 
government. 

"I felt my job at Chase [Bank] 
would go on further," Rockefell er 
said. "I would be able to do things 
through Chase that were broader, 
able to meet people in other parts 
of the world. 10 take four years out 
in pu blic oftlce was nO,t !~ my best 
Interest or the country s. 

Rockefeller expressed concern 
about the disparity in incomes 
between the wealthy and the poor 
in the United States, but he was 
also optimistic about the state of 
the economy. He added that the 
Federal Reserve Board and the 
Treasury Department are taking 
"appropriate measures" regarding 

. the current U.S. economic slump. 
"We need to find more employ-

ment, raising the income of the 
poor, not just lopping off what the 
rich have [with high taxes] . 
Incentives for people to make lots 
of money is why we do so well ." 

Despite his decision not to 
accept public office, Rockefeller is 
no stranger to U.S. government 
leaders. Rockefeller's brother, 
Nelson, was vice president under 
Gerald Ford, ran for president 
three times and occupied the New 
York governor's scat from 1958 to 
1973 . His relationship with hi. 
brother was somewhat strained. 

" I disagreed with Nelson's deci-
sion to divorce his first wife and 
then remarry quickly," Rockefeller 
said. "But at no time did I not have 
a close worki ng relationship with 
him. Had he been elected president, 
he would've done a very good job." 

During the Vietnam War, 
Rockefeller's relationships with his 

MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL 
ST. LOUIS RAMS VS. CHICAGO BEARS 

children were also strai ned. 
Rockefeller believed that "if 

the communists took Vietnam, 
they would've taken Australia" and 
eventually would have conquered 
other countries. His children were 
against the war. 

Then in 1980, the chi ldren took 
Rockefell er and his wife on a week-
long vacation, which set a new tone 
for their relationship. 

Rockefeller has owned and 
operated a number of ventures, 
often receiving cri ticism for his 
management liecisions. 

At one point, Rockefeller \Vas 
criticized for selling New York 's 
Rockefeller Center to the Japanese 
in 1989. 

"Having a very responsible 
Japanese company own [the 
Rockefeller Center) would not be a 
bad thing for the country," he sa id. 

Eventually, the Japanese compa-
ny fell on hard times, and was forced 
to sell it back. RockefeHer tried to 
dissuade them, even going so far as 
to travel to Japan to speak with the 
company's managers in person. 

The intenriew ended with a ques-
tion on the impending war in Iraq. 

"[ was concerned at first that 
Bush was not talking with our allies," 
Rockefeller said. "['m glad to say 
that:s now changed substantially." 

One of the overarching themes 
of the discussion was the need for 
the United States to consider its 
role as a world leader when taking 
action in foreign affairs. 

"I feel sad that there isn't a 
greater recognition of the 
Amcrican people that the world is 
one world," he said. "And we play 
an important role in the U.N. and 
with other nations of the world."

State agencies' health plans should 
cover sex reassignment surgery 

By VALERIE BURNS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The city of San Francisco will now 
pay up ro $50,000 for its transsexual 
employees ro have sex changes. Although 
the ordinance has already been written 
and passed within San Francisco city 
limits, it has opened a wide debate on 
whether to implement such legislation in 
other large cities with comparably dense 
transgendered populations. Our own 
San Diego has one of the highest in the 
nation, unfortunately reflected in the 
high number of anti-transgender hate 
crimes occurring here. 

they account for 20 percent of all ami-
LGBT murders and about 40 perct:nt of 
the total incidents of police-initiated 
violence against the LGBT community. 
According ro the National Coalition on 
Anti-Violence Project, 10 percent of all 
ttansgendered individuals will be mur-
dered in a hate crime and close to 60 
percent will be victims of a hate crime. 

Gender Identity Disorder is the 
medical disorder that transsexuals are 
most often diagnosed with . GID is 
defined as an individual being born with 
the external anatomy of a gender that 
they don 't identify with internall y, and is 

recognized by the American

remains : Is the allocation of

disorder in need of medical 
procedure - in this case a 
sex change operation. G Il)

tion ci ted to justify the need 

changes state-funded. 
Before discussing this issue, it's nec-

essary ro do some basic word definition 
as well as education on the current state 
of transgendered individuals' daily lives. 
Transgender is an umbrella term for all 
those who don 't fa ll into the two soci-
eta lly accepted categories of "male" or 
" female." The term transgender 
includes those individuals who would 

' !nbel themselves transsexuals (pre-, post-
and non-operative). The o'ansgendered 
population faces dail y discrimin ation fo r 
just existi ng, and this discrimination i 
seen Illost blatantly through hate crimes.

Lesbian T.,sk Force, although transge n-
dered individuals make up only a small 
percentage of tile LGBT populntion,

ance companies ro pay for 

the patient'S sex change. 
There is pre-existing California case 

law providing the legal groundwork for 
state-contracted insurance companies to 
pay for state workers' sex changes. The 
most prominent case is that of C. /J. v. 
Je"01nc Lot'kne't' in 1978. In this 1975 case 
the appellant consulted his physicia n, 
who diagnosed him as havin g G ID or

mous). G. B.'s phys iCian diagnosed the 
cure or remedy for G ID as a sex change 
operation for tile appe ll ant. G.B. then

to get coverage for obtaining such a sex 
change. After a series uf denials, appeals

Sex changes are plastic surgery and 
should not be paid for by gov't 

By SAM WILSON 
Contributing Write r 

The City of San 
Francisco will now 
pay up to $50,000 per 
person to change the 
perceived sex identity 
of its employees. 

Al though a smallnum-
bel' of corporations have 

made the decision to spon-
sor sex change operations in 

the past, San Francisco's 
decision is unprecedented 
because it is the first time 

that a government has extend-
ed this privilege to its employ-

ees. The decision was made by a 
decisive vote of 9-2 by 

going from one gender to another." But 
no coherent line has really been drawn 
here; the sex change is not a med ica lly 
necessary or advantageous procedure -
it is politic ized cosmetic surgery. 

The cosmetic nature of reassignment 
is unchanged by the psychological issues 
concern ing gender identity that sur-
round the operation . All other cases of 
cosmetic surgery also engender a COIl -
stellation of pos ible emotions, from 
hope and satisfac tion to anxiety or 
doubt. To downplay these emotions and 
separate cosmetic surgery frOI11 sex reas-
signment is irresponsible. 

Trivial as most plastic surgery may 
seem, a penis enlargement could nll'n 
around the sex life of a man with an 
unusually small petus, as could a bre'tst 

adjustment for a woman with 
San Francisco's board of 

supervisors last April, and 
there is no debating that it is 
an exciting policy experiment. 
But like many experiments, 
this policy should come to an 
end and be acknowledged as 

(ON extremely uneven breasts. Compared to tile drasti c identity transformatioll of sex change surgery, thest: retoolings seem trivi al. After 
all , the perceived shortcom-

an idiosyncratic lapse in judg-
ment reg-Jrding .the role played by gov-
ernment in the confusing space between 
medicine and gender politics created by 
the sex change operation. 

The decision comes with a mandatory 
S18.50 per month premium increase for 
municipal employees, which also includes 
other new benefits like fertility treatment. 
Breast implants and the removal of the 
Adam's apple :Ire not covered by the ser-

\~ce, meaning that a believable male to 
female change would be shortchanged 
over a female to male switch, an inequal-
ity that is hard to rationalize as part of a 
policy meant to reduce discrimination . 

City spokesperson Marcus Arana 
tries to sell this inequality as a medical 
distinction, saying "this is not about cos-
me ic procedures, it's about the basics of 

ings that inspired these lesser 
body modifications don 't 

have a full-blown social movement 
behind them; they don't have a glossary 
of terms and a dialogue of oppression . 

Transsexuals can now claim their own 
psychiatric classi fication, termed gemicr 
dysphoria. Webster's dictionary states 
the medical definition of dysphoria is: 
"impatience under affliction; morbid 
restlessness; disSlitisfaction; the tid gets ... 
T he affliction in this case is a normal, 
healthy set of genitals that the patient 
deems undesirable. Under this concep-
tion of a disorder, what precludes the 
classification of breast dysphoria? Nose 
dysphoria? Race dysphoria? Simple dis-
satisfaction with one's body image amI 
identity is not a medically compel!ing

Boy Scouts can exclude atheists 
Private organization demands piety 

Americans abroad 
should teach about u.s. 

By DUSTIN FRELICH 
Staff Writer 

The Boy Scouts of America is 
freshly embroiled in yet another 
attack on its values. This time, the 
assault comes from an atheist 
stripped of his scouting status 
after he refused to acknowledge a 
higher being or Creator. 

The problem with this lawsuit 
is that it is the essence of c1osed-
mindedness - that just because 
the Boy couts don 't have the val-
ues of a cerrai n sub-group, be it 
atheists this time (or gays the last), 
dissidents seek to indulge their 
'Iffini ty for belief imperialism in 
an attempt to change the va lues of 
the organization. Indeed, the Boy 
Scouts of America is freshly off an 
attack on its va lues from numer-
uus gay groups that claimed that 
the pri vate organiza ti on must 
accept gay troop leaders. 

Thlt's the crux of the argu-
mem, however: The Boy SCOUlS 
of America is a private organiza-
tion and it can choo e to admit or 
excl ude as it sees fit. Although this 
may be reprehensible to some sec-
tors of American society, the 
acceptance of the scouts' abi lity to 
manage their own organization, to 
not have the government interfere 
in their doings, is a crucial right 
given ro (a ll) private orga luza-
tions. 

Nevertheless, the Boy Scouts 
won the legal battle, challengi ng 
the decision of a lesser court and 
hringing it to the Supreme Court . 
But the threat of belief imperia l-
ism is not going to die off in the 
foreseeable futu re. 

In June 2000, the high court 

,

NATIONAL 
barred gays from being troo p 
leaders, saying that this would 
infringe on the scouts' First 
Amendment rights, namely, of 
"the right of the people peaceably 
to assemble." I know some people 
like to tarnish documents written 
by "stupid old white men," bu t 
there's a reason they have stood 
the test of time for over 200 yea rs: 
T hey apply to everyone. 

T he beauty of the First 
Anlendment, sometimes to tile 
disgust of some: American citi-
ze ns can't cherrypick tlle consti-
tutionally given rights they want 
to give to groups they may 
oppose; they ap ply to all groups at 
all times. 

Indeed, the challenge of the 
Boy Scouts by the self-proclaimed 
atheist, 19-year-old Eagle Scout 
Darrdl Lambert, has no lega l 
footing. But the issue is more a 
socia l one than a legal battle, 
mainly because the lega l issue is 
clo ed . What this Eagle Scout 
and his lawyer have failed to com-

Poetry SIamm 

prehend is the almost 100-year-
old Scout Oath, which starts off, 
"On my honor, I will do my best 
to do my duty to God and my 
coun!ry and to obey the Scout 
Law. 

Furthermore, investigating the 
requirements for joining the Boy 
Scouts, 3S explained in the Boy 
Scouts Official Joining 
Requirements, the line, "under-
stand and agree to live by the 
Scout Oath or Promise, Ltw, 
Motto, and Slogan, and the 
Outdoor Code," leaps off the 
page. Of particular interest : 
"'lgree to live by the Scout Oath" 
and "Law." 

The Scout Oath, whi ch scours 
are expected to repeat hundreds of 
times while a sCOut, contains twO 
very important phrases: "to God" 
and "obey the Scout Law." 

Let's 's tart with the former. 
Now, for me, saying "do my duty 
to God" means tllat 'I scOut would 
obviou Iy be lying not only to 
himself but also to the Boy Scouts 
of America if he joined the organi-
za ti on, knowing full well he did 
not fit all the requirements -
namely, that of foll owing the 
SCOut Oath. And coupled wi th tlle 
phrase, "On my honor," what 
honor is existent when a scout is 
lying to himself every time he 
recites the very imporrant Scour 
Oath? 

Secondly, the SCOllt Law sheds 
some light o n the increasingly 
clear picture . Exami ning the

With the weapons inspec-tors heading into Baghdad today, there will 
be intensification in the debate on 
what to do if Hussein gives the 
U.N . team trouble or if there is anv 
evidence found of nuclear weapon'-
ry. Furthermore, the spotlight will 
be on President George W. Bush 
and his reaction to the verdict from 
the weapons inspecrors. [n essence, 
the credibi lity of the United States' 
strong words of condemnarion now 
hang in the balance. 

With these new issucs coming to 
the limelight, U.S. students here in 
Cork are likely to have to explain the 
actions - good or bad - of thei r 
coun try to the insatiably cu rious 
Irish students. European students in 
general, who only have a strongly 
liberal media to give them informa-
tion on the United States, are look-
ing for explanations of U.S. actions. 
Ideally, in this simation, American 
students would honor their country 
by explaining the different poli tical 
ideologies and then presenting \Vhy 
they agree or disagree wi th tl1em. 
Unfortunately, many left-wing 
American studcnts have abandoned 
any defense of thei I' coun try in an 
effort to gain converts and di,ciples 
in European Socialist couno·its. 

It is coml11on knowledge that 
Europe tends much more toward 
sccia li, m than the United States. As 

expected, many European students 
either don't understand or strongly 
disagree with the policies pursued by 
the U.S. government. Regardless, 
the vast majority is willing to listen 
to the reasons for policies coming 
across the ocean of which they have 
minimal understanding. 

Therefore, it is all the m ore 
imporranr that mdcnts representing 
America a broad should stand II p and 
explain the mental atti rude of 
Americans. Once doin[! so, it is then 
perfectly acceptable to agree or dis-
agree wi th the cu rrent trend In 
Americ,m thinking. T hese are the 
very fundamental aspects of n'ltion-
alism, which have notlling to do with 
differcnt political ideolo[!ics. The 
real crime IS not givin[! Europe:1I1 
students an accura te portray:1i of 
why politics are the way they arc . 

For extreme st1ld (;11l activisb, 
who are the worst perpetrators of

Pro: Sex change is recognized 
treatment for a disorder 

cominucd from plll(e 4 
and overturns, the case went to the 
California Court of Appeals, where 
the court overturned the previous 
decision by the director of the 
California Deparmlent of H ealth, 
setting as precedent that the sta te 
(specifically its state-contracted 
insurance company, Medi-Ca l) be 
require I to pay for the sex changes 
of its transsexual employees. 

This case did many things 
besides set precedent. f<irst of all , it 
had prominent doctors state under 
oath that sex changes were neces-
sary for those diagnosed with GID 
(transsexuals). Dr. John Brown stat-
ed that G .B. "must have the 
requested surgery to treat her disor-
der and prevent further suffering, 
en'lble her to participate in normal 
living, and obtain steady employ-
ment." He went on to say that "a 
preoperative transsexual , in my 
experience, is often unable to obtain 
employment due to employer's bias-
es, the requirements of a physical 
examination prior to employment, 
or psychological instability resulting 
from the frustration at being 
trapped in the body of a person of 
the opposite sex." 

The second thing the case of 
G.B. v. Jerome Lackmr provided 
was a legal interpretation of the 
Medi-Cal insurance company con-
tract. The wording of the extent of 
Medi-Cal coverage is incredibly 
wide and is said to provide (as writ-
ten in Welfare and Institutions 
Code section 14059) "diagnostic, 
preventive, corrective and cllrative 
services and supplies essential 
thereto, provided by qualified med-
ical and related personnel for con-
ditions that cause suffering, endan-
ger life, result in illness or infirmi-
ty, interfere with capacity for nor-
mal activity including employment, 
or for conditions which may devel-
op into some significant handicap." 

According to federal regulations, 
a state (which administers the joint 
state-federal Medicaid program) 
may not "arbitrarily deny or reduce 

the amollnt, duration or scope of 
such sel'Vices to an otherwise c1ig'i hie 
individual solely becausc of rhe diag-
nosis, typt: of illness, ur condition." 
In recognition of this language ,md 
the above ruling, COllrts have gCIli.:r-
ally accepted dlC claim h · .1\ ledlc;lid 
coverage of trans5~xual surg~r\' hy 
persons who can substantiate their 
medic:11 need for it (read: those ,,·hl) 
can be diagnused by a doctor under 
oath to have GID). 

The case of G.8. t' . JCI'U"''' 
Lackncr was a milestone for Ihe 
tmnsgendered pre-, post- al1d nOI1-
operative communi ty. It set prece-
dem for state-contracted instlr;lI1CC 
companies to pay for rransscxlIal 
state employees' sex change:;. 
However, since dlis rulin~, insur-
ance companies have evade'tl thi s hy 
having their contracts speci fiedl ), 
exclud e sex changes. 

Case law and professional med-
ical opinion :lI'e on the side of tr;1I15-
sexual state workers in regards to the 
argument at hand. Thlllssex'Uals su f-
fer from GID, and the APA and doc-
tors under oath have stated that sex 
changes are the most effective reme-
dy to help these suffering individu -
als. Precedent, established in the 
verdict of G.B. v. J C1'Umr Lac/am; 
gives strong support at thc legal 
level. 

Unfortunately, state-contracted 
insurance companies have becn 
able to avoid following these state-
set guidelines. They have done thi s 
by simply having their anorneys 
reword thei r contracts with th t: 
state to specifically exclude se ~ ­
change operation candidates frnlll 
obtaining insurance. The insur;lIlce 
companies have done similar thing-s 
with cancer patients, either exclud -
ing them or maki ng thei r prelni-
ums extremely high. However, San 
Francisco has found an insurance 
company that doesn't have such an 
exclusion in its contract.Thus, one 
can determine that it is just a ques-
tion of public orga lliz.ation (i.e. tht: 
State) contracting out to such 
insurance companies. 

Con: Surgery does not correct 
a problem, is only cosmetic 

continued from page 4 
issue. As judge Scon Acting said in 
his dissent to the decision in G.B. v. 
Jerome Lackner, granting the right 
to sex change opera tions under 
Medi-CaJ in the '70s, "in transseA'U-
al surgery, as in other kinds of cos-
metic surgery, nodling is physically 
amiss with the function of the por-
tion of the body which is altered." 

But is it any wonder that the 
medical community is embracing 
the surgery? At $50,000 per person, 
each procedure is a boon to the 
industry, and with the improvement 
of surgical methods, demand con-
tinues to mount. Gender dysphoria 
did not exist as a coherent psychi -
aU'ic condition before the advem of 
the surgery itself. Sex-change 
surgery is a munut'lCtured demand, 
,mel transsexual culture is a gl'Owing 
advertisement for the identity and 
lifestyle surrounding reassignment. 
As the biographies of successful 
converts continue to accumulate, an 
increasingly sophisticated portrayal 
is being cul tivated of transsexuals as 
not only mere members of their 
chosen gender, but innovators who 
flaunt the oppressive conventions of 
gender. In the same breath, they ask 
the public to foot the bil l for the 
realization of this image. 

Unfortunately for many trans-
sexuals, post-op life often does not 
measure up to the image portrayed 
by the medical profession and 
activist communi ty. Transgendered 
people often face serious discrimi -
'nation and are not accepted by oci-
ety as their chosen gender, even 
after extensive hormone therapy. 
While most are satis6ed with the 

surgery itself, lIlany are not pleased 
with their overall appearance. A 
male reassigned to a female, Ii)!' 
instance, may have serious problellls 
dealing \vith her Adam's <lpple, larl!'e 
hands, voice tone and facial hair. 

The surgery i tsc l f inevi ta hi y 
cuts some nelves, reducing sensi-
tivitY in dIe <Hea . A femal e convert-
ing to a male must choose betwcen 
a small , unrealistic but rebtivdv 
scnsitive micro-penis or a normaf-
sized perus wi th much-reduced 
sensi ti vity. Ei ther of these cOllld he 
a serious barrier to <I sat isfactol'V 
sex life. As with any surgery, there 
can be medical complications. The 
geni tals have a hi gh conct:lltr:a ion 
of blood vesseb, and hClllorrh'lgi ng 
i, comlllon. 

The cou rt decision Illentiulled 
abuve reljuired ,Vleel i-Cal to pay for 
the aprellanl's reassignmcnt, allLl 
other surgeries were covered under 
this decisio n. However, Medi-Cal 
realized many of the ethical draw-
backs of sponsoring this expensive 
surgery and effectively. negated the 
decision by requiring potential cus-
tomers to sign a waiver preempting 
the po sibility of the procedure. 
The medical community brought 
a.n unceremonious end to this very 
similar foray of the justice system 
into gender politics. While people 
should have the frcedom to modify 
their bodies in any way they ee tit 
within the bounds of relative safety, 
the governlllent hould not involve 
itself in their decision . The medicli 
community should not be given 
incentives to further blur the lint: 
betwecn desire and necessity in this 
plastic surgery-crazed era.

Scouts: Group's ethos centered around God 
. n Jnunued {rum page 5 

.ICroSS the phrases of "A Scout tells 
the truth. lie IS honest." Isn't it a 
bi t strange that when a scout is 
expected to be honest and tell the 
truth , an atheist scour who has lied 
ro himself and the urga ni z.a ti on 
si nce he joined wants to get away 
with criticizing the Boy Scouts of 
Amenca for being true to its va l-
ues' 

Agai n referring to those pages 
in the scoutS' own handbook, 
there's an interesting little tidbit: 
"A Scour is reverent rowa rd God ." 
I'm not even really sure how the 
scouts can be anything but crystal 
clear in this statement - if you are 
a SCOUI, you must be "reverent 
toward God." It's rather simple 
rea lly: If you don't fi t the require-
ments of joining, you are entirely 
free to join another organization. 

But the jackpot is in a phrase 
that shortly follows; U[A Boy Scout] 
respects the beliefs of others." An 

almost pantheistic strike-down of 
the current co mplaints lodged 
against the Boy SCOuts, this phrase 
is absolu te gold. It seems almost 
oxymoronic and void of any consis-
tency that a scout who is taught to 
respect differences in beliefs will 
criticize the organ izati on on the 
basis of a difference of beliefs, not 
try to change them. 

Like it or not, we live in a 
world of competing beliefs. But 
what makes us American is that we 
don 't try to force our beliefs on 
others. Usually we equate that 
with fa scism, but why does the 
politically correct crowd defend 
belief imperialism when it applies 
to groups they support and not for 
groups they oppose' 

Again, if I'm not mistaken , the 
requirements of becoming a Boy 
Scout should fi l ter out all atheists 
who do not agree with the Scout 
Oath and Scout Law. And if these 
beliefs or values do not fit yours, 

the solution is simple; Find anoth-
er orga nization. That's the heauty I 
of freedom. 

The closi ng argument in this 
debate comes fairly and si mpl y 
down to freed()m . If someone is 
offended by the Boy ScoutS' mes-
sage, they are free to jo in another 
scouting- type orga nization; they 
can join other groups of similar val-
ues or possibly smrt a competing 
organiz'ltion if they are so inclined. 
(This is exactly the idea behind the 
Girl Scouts.) 

'vVhile tile Atheists of America 
and tile Gay Scouts of America 
would be organizations that dis-
senters could establish, they should 
refrain from trying to change the 
values of the long-standing private 
organization, just like they wouldn't 
want belief imperialism imposed on 
their values. For the beautiful nanlre 
of America is the result of our dif-
ferences, not our unifornuty. And 
what a beautiful America we live in.

Unfortunate ly, neither do many of 
the American srudents. 

For example, a particularly curi-
ous Irish student asked an American 
frie nd uf mine why Bush thought it 
necessary to take action against Iraq 
in the war on terrorism. Rather 
than e .~plaining the rationale and 
then suppor ting or con lemning it, 
she said, " Don 't look a t me, I didn 't 
\'ote f()r him." Loolcing over to me, 
she continued, "Ask him, be's tile 
Republican," with a sneer. It then 
became my obliga tion to explain 
the policy o f th e president in detail. 
Then, of co ur 'C, I added that I 

a~reed with most of it, and dis-
'lgreed with some of it. I would 
hope that the curious Irish tudent 
wOllld eventually make IllS own 
decision based on knowledge of the 
whole situati on, no t based on 
insults against Repllbli ca ns. 

As these verba l insults to 
America continue and escalate, it 
becomes more clear which students 
have absolutely no respect for the 
country tha t gave them the freedom 
to travel abroad. 

Before leaving the country, the 
Programs Abroad Office told the 
students that it was a wonderful 
opportunity to get a bener under-

standing of other cultures. As a par-
allel, we were told that we would be 
asked many questions regarding our 
own cllirure. As representatives of 
the United States, it is a wonderful 
opportunity to give foreign students 
an insight into American cul ture. By 
viciously denying any ownership of 
current Americar, political thought 
merely because they disagree with 
it, these srudents are destroying one 
of the mOSl important facets of 
being American students abroad. 

Thus, because so many extrem-
ists in college pol itics are bent on 
the uner disowning of their cou ntry, 
they are not only showing their 
ingratirude, but :lIso ruin ing foreign 
students' chances at gai ning insight 
into the average American's thought 
process and culture. In light of an 
already cynical Europe, this is the 
worst representati on of America 
one can offer a European student. 

A great majority of college stu-
dents love their country and every-
thing it has done for them. As a 
result, many students walk away 
from social encounters with grea ter 
understanding of different cultures 
and have gained an even more 
"open mind ." Unfortunately, 
Anlerica has sent a fair amount of 
extremists over to Europe. These 

supposedly open- minded snldents 
tllen immediately make it their cru-
sade to enourage greater hatred of 
the United States in the minds of 
European students. 

Consequently, it is an ironic 
concept that we should be tryi ng to 
o btain peace and understanding, 
when such a degree of our own col-
lege peers are out there so vivi dly 
suwing seeds of ha tred and con-
tcmpt for their country. If tllese 
students wcre half as intelligent as 
tlley think they are, then their fair-
minded approach ancl honest, justi-
fied dissent would finall y be some-
til ing more than just "whiney col-
lege activislll." 

As the eyes of the world w,ltch 
President Bus h and his reaction to 
the upcoming Iraqi con frontations, 
America's ho pe in its students 
sho uld be that enough of the appre-
ciative, inte ll igent and frecdom-
loving stud ents will be able to show 
our European co unterparts the 
hatred and intolerance of extremists 
that are somehow representing us 
all over the world . Regardless of 
the outcome, consent or dissent, 
war or peace, hopefully some col-
lege students will have a greater 
understanding of America's culture, 
not just the fringes of extremism.

University Centers conducts survey 
UCAB to use data to aid in expansion plans 

By LAURA McGANN 
Senior Staff Writer 

,\11 A.S . Coun cil ta sk fo rce 
\\ III a~k students to contribute 
t heir twO cents on . ov. 18 
rega rding a Universiry Centers 
expa ll>ion , in exchange for a 
c hance at pri ze . 

Al l but 1,000 students will be 
receivi ng an e-mail asking them to 
participate in a \Veb-based survey 
d esigned to assess how the 
U niversirv enters facilities are 
meeting 'the needs of students. 
The remaini ng 1,000 students will 
be contacted for a telephone-

based survey. 
The lI.r~eys are being condLict-

cd to determine whether students 
believe an expansion to the 
University Centers is necessary 
and if students would suppOrt an 
expansion. 

TIle task force that is working 
on the expansion effort, which was 
chartered one year ago, edited 
surveys that were proposed by an 
outside group, Brailsford and 
Dunlavey, after holding focus 
groups with sUldents last qu arter. 

T he W eb survey will be hosted 
by Brailsford and Dunlavey and 
the telephone survey will be con-

ducted by San Diego State 
University'S oc ia l science 
research laboratory. University 
Cenrers Advisory Board Chair 
James Lynch said th 'lt SDSU's 
research laboratory offers a "rep-
utable ervice ." He also said tha t it 
has condu cted numerous tele -
phone surveys, incl uding surveys 
at oth er uni versi ties. 

Srudents who participa te in the 
surveys will be given an opportu-
nity to sign lip for a drawing to 
win a Palm Pilot, an occasional -
use "A" sPOt, a mountain bike, a 
Sony Playstation and Rubio's gift

Law school dreams 

Rachel A G;/fcia/Cuordion 
Jurisprudence: UCSD student Shahdeh Ammadi speaks to Jeff Kob ulnick about 
~l -appl0ng to law school at the Nov. 14 law school fair held on Library Walk. 

Forum: Similar discussions 
to take place at other UCs 

continued from page I 
budget is in, we're not here to ask 
for money," Hernandez said early 
on in the meeting. "We're asking 
the state to make an inquiry. 
Middle management is making the 
lives of workers unbelievably hard." 

According to Hernandez, work-
ers are screamed at, talked down to 
and generally mistreated. H e 
believes that severe understaffing 
and an excessive number of super-
visor positions are the catalysts to 
the bulk of this mistreatment. 

"This system does not deal 
properly with abusive manage -
ment," Hernandez said. "Ninety 
percent of problems center around 
the managers." 

The first worker to address the 
panel was Teodalo Balagat, who is 
currently employed as a lead custo-
dian at the 

" 

University's sick leave policy, reaf-
firming that the 1993 Family 
Medical Leave Act, which allows 
workers to take time off to care for 
their family members, does apply 
to UC workers. 

Davis also emphasized that all 
employees have the ri ght to bring 
issues forward through their union 
representative. 

"I'm hearing many of these 
grievances for the first time," Davis 
said. "I'm not here to debate the 
issues, just to inform the workers 
of what their entitlements arc ." 

However, in terms o f the allega-
tions of racial - and gender-based 
discrimination and sexua l harass-
ment, Davis took a firmer sta nce, 
arguing that type of misconduct is 
not accepted at UCSD.

tion on the line to

issues," he s,lid. 

Hillcrest hospital. 
According to 
Balagat, the people 
in his department 
were forced to rake 
a salary cap in 
order to keep dleir 
jobs. 

AJ most three 
years ago, he was 
asked to accept a 
decrease in pay 
and hours result-
ing from budget 
cuts. Balagat said 
he had previously 
been working at

custodian at Hillaest 

medical center 

Hillcrest on a full -time schedule 
for six years. T hough he did not 
like the reduction in his status, his 
wife was pregnant and he needed 
to keep his job. 

"Our department is severely 
understaffed," Balagat said. "Many 
times we give up ou r breaks and 
lunch to help our coworkers . 
Sometimes we have to cut corners 
to get all the work done. This is 
not right. The patient suffers ." 

Balagat also complained about 
the subcontract held by Aramark 
Corporation. Acco rding to him , 
Ara mark management's chief con-
cern is staying under budget. 
Under the Aramark administra-
tion,.Balagat claims that people are 
no t properl y trained and that this 
leads to people getting injured or 
quitting their jobs. 

Bal agat admonished manage-
Illent for a new policy in his 
department that does no t allow 
workers to spea k in their native 
languages at work, even while on 
sanctioned breaks. 

"My department and I feel that 
Aramark manageme nt needs to 
go," Balagat said. "They totally 
disregard our union co ntracts and 
they di regard th e workers." 

Assistant Vice C hancellor of 
Human Re ources Rogers Davis 
add ressed the forum as the univer-
sity's represe ntative. H e answered 
questions regarding the 

Hernandez said 
that when workers ask for time off 
for sick leave, they arc verba ll y rep-
rimanded. This verbal censure, 
called an "occurrence," often leads 
to marks on the worker's record or 
bad eva luations, accordi ng to 
H ernandez. 

"Sick workers are coming into 
conta ct with patients because they 
are afra id to ask for the time off," 
Hernandez s'lid . "Yes, we ca n tile a 
grievance, but 95 percent of dIe 
time it's stopped at step one," 
H ernandez said. "We have a prOCt!-
dme , but ir's not wOI'ki ng. 
Supervisors need to be held 
accountable to the workers." 

The second worker to speak was 
Patricia Segrest, a seni or custodia n 
at Hillcrest medical center. Segrest 
said she has worked as a housekeep-
er for five years and that overall , 
she enjoys her job. One of her main 
duties is to clean patient rooms to 
prepare them for the next patient. 

Segrest also said that the 
Aramark corporation hinders the 
work environment and does not 
provide compe tent management. 
According to her, there art! numer-
ous incidents of race- and gender-
based discrimination anti sexual 
harassment that go unmentioned 
in her department. he said work-
ers have lost faith ill the current 
system of filing compl aints con-

cerning supervi or because there 
:Ire often incidents of retaliation . 

"[Supervisors] yell at you in 
from of patients," Segrest said . 
"They give unfair evaluations to 
stop us from getting raises. People 
fear for their job. They fear retal-
i:ltJon." 

Segrest also accused Aramark 
of perpetuating improper health 
and safety precautions. 

"We are supposed to be 
informed when a room has been 
exposed to airborne diseases like 
TH ," Segrest said. "There is a uni-
versal two-hour rule that you are 
not supposed to go and clean a 
roOIl! for two hours after the 
patient ha left. We are frequently 
not informed, and this rule is 
ignored." 

Employees and union leaders 
felt the forum was a necessity to 
improve working conditions 
before drastic measures, such as 
walkouts, take place. 

"This is not about money, this 
is about resp ect," said Jorge 
Olvera, a UCSD campus 
groundskeeper and dIe AFSCME 
loca l union 3299 service vice pres-
ident. "This wi ll not cost the uni-
versity - not a penny." 

In an interview regarding dIe 
forum, Davis expressed that he

The show included a variety of 

bands including Locale AM; 
Rochelle, Rochelle; Buck-O- ine; 
and hip-hop group L.A. 
Symphony. Between sets, TMTV 
hosted " ~ I Bet You Will" games, 
where students partook in wacky 
dares. Throughout the concert, 
students gathered arou nd the 
stage, listening and dancing as each 
of the bands performed their set. 

"The bands have been rea lly 
gO( .1," said J ohn Muir College 
se ni or Tim Fox. " 1 haven't been to 
a lot of activities on campus, bur I 
think this is onc of the most fun 
that I've been to ." 

Marshallpalooza! began as an 
idea developed by the Thurgood 
Marshall Student Counci l last year. 
A separate committee was then 
created to research and plan the 
event in coordination with the 
TMC dean's office, the Marshall 
student council and other campus 
organi za tions. Subcommittees 
acquired donations for pri zes, a 
lineup for the concert and other 
necessities for the event. 

"We wanted everyone to come, 
have a wonderful time and to have 
fun ," said Marshallpalooza! 
Committee Chair Kendra Murphy. 
"We also wanted it to be some-
thing that es tablishes a socia l 
aonosphere earlier in the year." 

Marshallpalooza! is the first in a 
series of activities available for stu-
dents during Thurgood Marshall 
Week. Some of the events include a 
casual forum with the dean, the 
unveiling of th e new Thurgood 
Marshall commemorative stamp, 
and a lecture by Randall Kennedy, 
an author, Harvard Law School 
professor and former law clerk to 
J llstice Marshall. 

"The purpose of the week is to 
celebrate the essence of our col-
lege, have students showcase their 
talents and to encourage commu-
nity and school pride," said Dean 
of Student Affairs Ashanti 
Houston-Hands. 

Plans for next year's 
Marshallpalooza! include an 
expansion of the variety of vendors 
and ga mes avai labl e.

D avis, however, feels that the 
current system does work when 
timely allegations are made about 
specific cases. He also mentioned 
that there are hotlines that work-
ers can call to report misconduct

One study of Hrv prcvalence in 
Latino men-who -havc -had-scx-
with-men populations in San Diego 
and Tijuana ci ted by Dr. Matt Facer 
of Ca lifornia's Office of AIDS 
showed 20 percent of surveyed men 
in Tijuana were infected with H1V, 
while 33 percent of men sun-eyed in 
San Diego tested positive. Facer 
cautioned that whi le these numbers 
were probably not retl ective of the 
entire Latino men-who-have-had-
sex-with-men population, they do 
suggest higher rates than those in 
other population subgroups. 

No stud ies have been conducted 
on the extent to which young a Iliits 
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border for 
recreational purposes like clubbing 
or travel may contribute to the 
spread of the disease. 

uThose are the ages where the 
rates are the highest, so it 's likel y to 
think that that could be a particular 
problem," Samuel said. "It could 
also be compounded by the fact 
that many people in those age

• Taking a look a·t 
the international 

studies major 
By HANA HSU 

Staff Writer 

At UCSO, with a veritable buffet of disciplines, choosing your major or minor can often be 
both an enticing and overwhelming 
task. Often , the solution is to build 
one 's own major. But now, especially 
for those seeking an interdiscipl!l1ary 
major with 3 11 international c::mphasis, 
there is a satistying solution: the new 
imcrnallonal studies maJor. 

From proposal to reality 
internati onal studies mav sound a 

lot like "international relations (politi-
cal sCience)," but I.S. IS another major 
altogether. According to LS. Director 
Miles Kahler. who IS also a professor at 
th e UCSO's graduate school of 
lmernation:ll Re lations and Pacific 
Smdies, "Many facul ty saw fa] gap in 
our interdisciplinary programs as a 
senous shortcoming." 

o in 1998, an international studies 
Advisory Committee consisting of key 
fuculty members and senior administra-
tors recommended the creation of the LS. 
debrree. Critical members involved includ-
ed Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Marsha Chandler, Dean of Social 
Sciences Paul Drake and professors 
Joseph Esherick, David Lake. Robert 
Cancel, M aria Polinsky, J!lmes Rauch, 
Suzanne Brenner and Ann Cnig. 
Chandler asked for a faculty group 
chaired by professor Ellen Comisso to 
fonn a proposal. The Committee on 
Educational Policy !lpproved it in 2001, 
and thus the 1.S. major and its supporting 
organization/research unit, the Institute 
for International, Comparative and Area 
Studies, were born. 

"The effort was a genuine interdisci -
plinary and ipterdepartmenta1 effort ... 
and the departments have continued to 
be very helpful in beginning the LS, 
major." Kahler said, 

Actually, the new major is reaIIy seven 
different majors - that is, international 
studies offers seven dift'ereat degrees in 
the departments it is comprised of; includ-
ing anthropology, economics, hismty,lin-
guistics, Iitenture, political science tnd 
sociology. Its specialty, however. lies in its 
truly interdisciplinary requirementS. Ail 
LS. major is lila: having a minor, a mini-
minor, an area of concentration, a fQreia 
language program and quasi-Facufty 
Mentor Program all in one. 

The primary track (main map-) and 
secondary track (chosen from mother 
participating major, Communications, or 
an area studies program) offer students 
solid srudies in one discipline as well as me 
flexibility to study a related subject or me 
same subject from other perspectives. The 
regional requirement encourages students 
to lOcus on one region mrough three 
classes. The core courses (Culture and 
Society in Intemational Perspective and 

~dvising: Director of International Studies and IlCAS, Professor Miles Kahler (left) and 
Program Coordinator and Adviser Ahren Crickard (right) advise Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore Gaire Tsai on the new major. 
Economics, Politics, and International 
Change) use an interdisciplinary approach 
to explore key international issues and are 
taught by a rotating roster of professors 
from the seven different disciplines. In 
addition, the capstone senior senlinar 
gives students the chance to discuss issues 
and complete a research paper with the 
support and guidance of a facuJty mem-
ber. The four-year plan incorporates time 
for students to study abroad. The result is 
a balanced interdisciplinary degree, pro-
viding both a broad background and a 
narrow focus in a particular world region. 

I.S. Program Coordinator and 
Adviser Ahren Crickard acknowledged 
that the 1.S. major is "more rigorous 
than other majors," but should not pose 
a problem. As Crickarc noted, I.S.'s 16 
upper-division requirements (as opposed 
to the average 12 for other majors) does 
not bother ambitious students. many of 
wb(JIJl plan to study abroad. 

"We even .have a couple of students 
who are double majors with a demand-
m, enginecriDg major as mcit second 
~.". Crickard said. "All of this is to 
say that with proper planning, you cap 
aI!soIutely finish in four years." 

In &ct, a few months .after its incqr 
lion. international studies has quid:ly 
grown Into a popular choice, not only 
among freshmen. but upperclassmen as 
wdI. 

"We've ~tten almost 80 srudents in 
less than a month ... it's been all over the 
board," Crickard said. "We mought we 
were targeting mainly freshmen. but we 
have juniors and seniors, roo." 

To accommodate upperclassmen who 
may be interested in the new major, the 

INIL core courses are open to any major 
tlus year. 

Student satisfaction 
Crickard notes that there are many 

r easons tha t students have flocked to the 
new major. 

" Some students have varied interests 
and would like to integrate those inter-
ests into one degree," Crickard said. 
"Some students want to create a degree 
that combines discipljnes that they 
would like to use in a career, Some stu-
dents want to focus on a specific region 
within me track disciplines and combine 
that wim their language proficiency." 

ReveUe College junior and transfer 
student Francis Osorio finds the new 
major appealing because he wants to 
study in Spain. 

As his friend. Earl Warren College 
junior Patricic Brown relates, saying "I 
told bim about (the I.S. major] because 
he WlIS doing bia but he wasn't ~ppy .,_ 
It wasn't rcally what he was interested in. 
He said he W2Dted to work overseas and 
possibly teach in Spain _ .. I thought, 
'This is the perfect major for him. , .. 

Similarly, Eleanor RooscvcIt College 
freshman David Tan said that the I.S, 
major appeals to him because he has 
always been intereSted in history and 
W2D1S to study abroad. 

"I would say that l.S, is very intlftSting 
because you have so many options," Tan 
said. "lbe variety of classes and freedom 
is appealing ... [andl you can travel around 
the world and learn about omer cultures." 

As to why he chose an international 
studies-history major over a regular histo-
ry major, Tan said, "It's more current. 

With international studi es, VOII can 
apply it. You can affect thc worid, POSSI-
bly even the fururc.'· 

Support and opportunities 
l3ut the new I.S . major is only parr 01 a 

larger network of oppomlllities for ~nl­
den,s imcrcsted in II1tcrnatlonal I'SUC:'.

"Our club gl\'cs [thoseJ sn,dcm, :1

Moreover, thanks to the Institute for 
International, Comparative and Area 
Studies, I.S. students can find IIldny 
opportunities. rrCAS works closely widl 
the Career Center, the Education Ahroad 
Program and other departments/pro-
grams, including UCSD's Gntcluatc 
School ofIRlPS, to provide international-
ly focused events and opportuniti es. This 
quarter alone, nCAS has sponsored or co-
sponsored 13 events, such as the recent 
"War wi th Iraq" panel feamring UCSD 
and California Western Law School pro-
fessors. 

Faculty perspectives 
The faculty is as excited as me students 

about me significance and potential of the 
new major, 

"It's vety difficul t to adequately under-
stand most significant international issues 
today, such as globalization, civil war, ter-
rorism ... without an interdisciplinary 
training ... me LS. major trains students 
for more comprehension [and) interna-
tional career possibili ties," Kahler said. 

For literature professor Stephanie Jed, 
the I.S. major is a chance to foreground 
"the importance of cultural Auency," 
something she observed as cOllunon in 
Europe and valuable to America. 

"Global business is done in English, 
but ... when students think about other 
languages, they usually only think of food . 
(Yet] businessmen [in other countries] 
have a really wide-ranging cui tural back-
ground in history [and] philo ophy," Jed 
said, 

Anthropology professor Nancy 
Postero also stressed the importmlce of 
international knowlege. 

"1 feel like the world is hecoming so 
interconnected that it's important for 
students to understand the relati ons 
between countries and cultures." Postero 
said. " I 'm particularly interested in mak-
ing sure we analyze the emhedded cul -

Major: LS. offers new, diverse choices 
cominwed from page I I 

mral assumptions that are behind 
political and economic relations ... 
[that we don't just treatl culture as 
something that each country has to 
sell but a whole way of thinking 
and seeing. 

I.S. vs. established majors 
Yet for all its merits, I.S. in no 

way replaces the established majors 
and is not a panacea for undeclared 
students: It is fundamentally an 
international major. 

As history professor Joseph 
Esherick said, "One thing we discov-
ered when we looked at other uni-
versities was that the international or 
global smdies major was common, 
but differed radically in their content 
... It was often a default, catch-all 
major ... not particularly rigorous. 

[I.S.} organizes [students'} diverse 
interests into a coherent curriculum 
so that there are sensible links, so 
that you get something useful for 
graduate school or a career." 

Literature professor Lisa Lowe, 
who will be teaching INTL 101 
neJt spring, further explains using 
the literatures of the world major as 
an example. 

"The 1.S. major is not intended 
to replace the L1WL major and 
doesn't afford students the in-depth 
study of literature, language and cul-
ture that the LlWL major does," 
Lowe said. "A lit major who wants to 
go to graduate school might choose 
LlWL ... But those I.S. students can 
take many of the same world litera-
ture courses and apply them tOWlIf(:\s 
the I.S. major, and supplement them 
with courses in international politics 
or economics. An I.~. major [might 
be more concerned with] interna-

tional matters. It's just a difference of 
purpose."

How does sleep deprivation affect your 
brain and immune system? 

- Hilary, Eleano,- Roosevr/r College 

Sleep is defined as a period of rest for the 
body and mind, during which decision-mak-
ing and consciousness are impartial and the 
body functions are partially suspended. It is 
a behavioral state marked by characteristic 
immobile posture and diminished hut readi-
ly-reversible responses to external stimuli. 

The process of sleep occurs in three dis-
tinct stages. The first, non-Rapid Eye 
Movement (NREM) sleep, occurs within the 
first 90 minutes of sleep. During NREM 
sleep, the body is at a restful state that sup-
POrtS the recuperative functions assigned to 
sleep . 

The second stage is a series of cycles 
alternating NREM sleep with Rapid Eye 
Movement (REM) sleep. As the number of 
cycles increases, the length of NREM sleep 
decreases and REM sleep increases. The 
length of this stage in sleep varies with each 
individual and is affected by state of physical 
health, psychological state and certain drugs. 

During the final stage the body enters 
tOta l REM sleep. At the end of the night 
most of the sleep is REM sleep, which is 
when most dreams occur. 

""hile everyone dreams every night, 
many do not remember dreaming; most 

THE U D GUARDIAN 

people are aware, however, that they dream 
right before waking. REM sleep provides a 
period of recuperation of mental activities and 
preparation for wakefulness. Scientists believe 
the increased metabolic activity in the brain 
during REM sleep positively affects the 
mind's ability to be receptive to information 
and the ability to assimilate it. 

crossword 

Your body needs both NREM and REM 
sleep in order to keep the brain and body 
functioning properly. Studies conducted on 
the activity of immune cells prior to and fol-
lowing sleep deprivation have shown a 25-
percent reduction in the activity of those cells. 
Keep in mind that sleeping pills can interfere 
with REM sleep. 

How do I best treat bums? 
- Mark, Revelle College 

First aid for a burn depends on the cause. 
A person with e lectrical contact or chemical 
exposure resulting in a burn should seek 
emergency care immediately. Burns due to 
hot objects are the most common. 

For hot-object burns, run cold water over 
the burn for 15 minutes to avoid ulcerations 
(bubbling of the skin). Cocoa butter, glycerin 
or petroleum can be applied over the burn to 
combat dryness. These can be applied as often 
as needed. Aerosols, such as Solarcaine and 
Dermoplast, can be applied to relieve pain. If 
the skin has been broken, an antibacterial 
sllch as Polysporin, Betadine or Hydrogen 
Peroxide should be applied. 

Pain resulting from a minor sunburn can be 
treated with aerosols mentioned previously, but 
only if not too severe. A general rule to remem-
ber is that self-treatable burns are painful. 

Lack of pain does not mean the burn is 
minor. Instead, it does not hurt because the 
nelVes have burned away. Do not use the 
absence of pain as a basis for determining if 
immediate care is needed . 

Those under the age of two and those 
afflicted in the face or genital area should seek 
immediate care. If your burn looks or feels 
worse, or if it has not improved within seven 
days, seek the advice of a doctor or pharmacist.

MONDAY. NOVEMBER 18.2002 THE UCSD G ARDIAN FEATURE~ I) 

the editors' 
soapbox 

Daniel Watts 

Collectives' self.-imposed exile from campus media inane 
Che Cafe 'should take a page from The Koala, court mainstream media 

The Che afe is a 
r es ta u r a n tl garde nl com m u n is t 
stronghold that serves vegan burri-
toS once a week, under co nstant 
threat of destruction by the vener-
able vice chance llor ' of Student 
Affairs, Joe Watson . fter a decade 
of combat with Watson, rhe ca fe 
still rands. 

Its heer defiance of the uni -
versity ad mini strators on t hi s 
ca mpu s of apatheti c, half-
comatose commuters is reason 
enough to celebrate its continued 
eXistence. 

The New Indicator is one of 
UCSO's littl e-k nown , student-
fund ed and student-operated pub-
licati o ns . Like the Nightcap, 
Calilo17l111 Rcvit,w and Tile Koala, 
the New Indicator is fu nded 
through the manda tory $2 1 fee 
that all students pay to the A.S. 
Council every quarter. The paper, 
run as a Borg-like "collective," 
reports on topics ranging from 
how the "Patriot Act Violates the 
Bill of Rights" to "Oealing with 
the Capitalist Media ." T he view-
points in the Nrw Indicot07' are 
those possessed by the radical left, 
:1n admittedly large portion of any 
coll ege campus, and that alone 
justifies its publication . 

However, as part of being the 
campus' dominant socialist jour-
nal of thollght and opinion, the 
New I7IdicotOl" tends to shoot itself 
in its collective foot when dealing 
with the rest of the civilized 
world . Its most recent blunder 
was made when the administra -
tion again attempted to sq uash 
the Che Cafe (this time employ-
ing the "U.S.A Patriot Act" to 

cl!nsor a Web site hosted by the 
Che) and the collective refused to 
make its case through conven-
tional media . 

The Ntw ludic'0,o7" "collective" 
is one of the half dozen experi-
ments in communism populating 
UCS O's southwest quadra nt. As 
sllch, it is one of the few organi za-
tions privy to the emotio nal out-
burs ts of the other coll ectives rhat 
pass for interviews and press 
releases. In its latest issue, the 
New bzdicato7' urges UCSD radi-
cals not to grant interviews with 
the "capitalist media," while 
simultaneously condemni ng the 
capitalists for omitting from their 
articl es any qllotes from the col-
lectives. 

The collectives can't have it 
both ways . Either they talk to 
reporters or their side isn't well-
represented in the stories printed 
by the capitalist media. Since the 
capi talist newspapers are the only 
ones with any significant reader-
ship, ignoring them means that no 
one will hear the collectives' 
views. 

Frankly, the only people likely 
to read the Nrw Indicat07':" report 
on the Che Cafe Web site fiasco 
- and take it seriously - are 
either dyed-i n-the-wool, bleeding 
red communists or people who 
have already researched the con-
troversy. In either case, the read-
ers ali'eady know about it, and the 
NrUJ Indicot07':" article wouldn't te ll 
them anythi ng new. 

T he Che Cafe collective 
refused to grant interviews to the 
Guardilln, the most widely-read 
campus publication, because the 

" As part of being the cam, 
pus' dominant socialist 
journal of thought and 

opinion, the New 
Indicator tends to shoot 
itself in its collective foot 

when dealing with the rest 
of the civilized world." 

Che Cafe only speaks with inde-
pendent media. Ironically, its def-
inition of "independent" includes 
the N('W bldicllror, a quarterly pub-
li cation entirely dependent on 
fu nding from the school, and not 
the GIlIIT'dilln, which draws its 
fundi ng from entirely non-UCSD 
sources. Which is more indepen-
dent: the self-s ufficient paper 
funded solely by advertisements 
primari ly from taco joints and tan-
ning salons, or the one begging 
for funds from the UCS O admin-
istration and student government? 

The collectives refuse to take 
personal responsibility for their 
actions or words, hoth in their own 
publications and in their dealing 
with the outside world. The rare 
sta tements they do release to the 
press are usually signed "The 
Coll ective," offering no human 
spokesperson to whom further 
questions may be directed. T heir 
justification of a collective signa-
mre is that it implies unanimity 
among the collectivists, protecting 
the individuals from direct attack 
by the administration; "strength in 
numbers" and all ti13t. 

But their lack of personal 
responsibility also contributes to 
the widespread perception of them 
as quaint throwbacks to the 1960s, 
and not as the popu] ist revolu tion-
aries they wish they were. 

At the very least, listing a 
media contact or spokespe rson 
would help them communicate 
their message to interested par-
ties. If a budding communist is 
looking for some comrades, the 
best he can do is send letters to 
the NfW Indicator' s "Iibertad" e-
mail account. 

The Nt'W Indifllfo7' lIsed to pub-
lish its staff members' first names 
in every issue. T hey stopped that 
practice soon after last spring'~ 
A.S. Council elections, in which 
some members of th e New 
lr,dicat01' collective ran for office. 
The New 17ldicllto7' candid?tes 
were inconvenienced by charges 
filed against them for debatably 
libelous material printed by the 
collective - material for whk h all 
members must take responsibility. 
With thei r new policy of COITI-

plete \vrirer anonymity, then:\ 110 
cha nc e of individual mClllhcr, 
ever agai n haVIng to :1I1,w<,:r for 
anything they pnm.

Martinez and the UCSD admini, -

If the Che Ca fe collecti\'e had

media outlets against the adminis-

were. But instead , it spoke only 
to the New blllirato7', which plIb-
lished an article about the co nrru-
versy nearly a month after i r h:td 
been resolved. 

TIl(' KOIIIII :,. victory was cheered, 
and the pa rtial vindication of the 
Che Cafe was lIuietly swept lInder 
the table. 

The accused ignore the med i:1 
at their own peril. 

The coll ectives arc idealists, 
unwilling ro compromise. Their 
refusal to wheel and deal with the 
ad mini stra tion gives them the 
respect of the students, but their 
refusal to associate with any other 
non-comm unist orga ni zation for-
ever marginalizes them.

md losing to CSU Fullerton . 

In spite of compt:ting with a 
very young lea rn , UCSD per-
funned strongly, especially against 
Division I CSU Fullerton. 

Tri ton head coach Stuart Lee 
was plea ed with the tournament . 

"\Ve have a very young team 
this year," Lee said . "We lost a 
third of our team to graduation and 
another third to the study abroad 
program, there are on ly five 
returners this yea r, but we're build-
ing a strong base for the future." 

As a team, the Triton women 
domina ted the tournament, defeat-
ing both the CSU Fullerton Titans 
and the Cal Tech Beavers. T he 
women were victorious in all three 
weapons - epee, foil and sabre-
azulIlst Cal Tech. The Beavers 
loohd incredibly undermatched 
against the superior Tritons, which 
cuuld perhaps be attributed to their 
Division II standing. 

The CSU Fullerton Titans, 
however, proved a tougher 0Ppo-
ncm and were able to defeat th e 
' Ij-iton women in the foil competi -
tion with a score of 5-4. However, 
UCSD's vic tories in sabre and 
epee, besting both matches with a 
score of 5 -4, gave them an overa ll 
nne-point lead against C U 
Fullerton, and thus the win. 

UCSD's men's team exhi bited 
similar mastery over Cal Tech, but 
IVa, unable to come lip with a win

against CSU Fullerton. The men 
won in sabre with an impressive 
score of7-2, but the Tritons lost in 
foil with a disappointing score of 
0-9 and were unable to come out 
on top in epee, losing by a score of 
2 -7, giving the Titan's the overall 
victory. 

CSU Fullerton defea ted Cal 
Tech in both the women's and the 
men's competitions to further 
exhibit its mastery of the foil. 

"fullerton is a national power-
house in foil competition," Lee 
said. "However, we are nationally 
competitive in the use of the sabre, 
so we knew coming in that the 
epee would be the deciding factor 
aga in t Fullerton. Our women 
were able to defeat them, but the 
men were not as successfu I. " 

Individually, UCSD's Raelyn 
Jacobson and Jeremy Runyan 
went undefeated on the day, both 

competing in the sabre division 
and showing much of the talent 
that allows the Tritons to contend 
on the national level in the use of 
the sabre. 

Jacobson , who was an National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
All-American in epee last year, has 
switched to sabre this year, and it's 
already clear that it has been a 
near flawless transition, highlight-
ing the tal ent she possesses as a 
fencer. 

Looki ng ahead, UCSD will 
host its first NCAA tournament of 
the yea r onJan. 15 with N ew York 
U niversity, Columbia University 
and Cal State Fullerton compet-
ing. All these schools are Division 
I champions, and tllis tournament 
should serve as a proving ground 
for the young Triton fencers look-
ing to regain the national level of 
play they possessed last yea r.

Tritons play host 
to CSUSB in meet 
Women 's swimming wins 189~ 111, 
while the Triton men lose 188~98 

By EVA HOFFMAN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD swimming and diving 
faced Cal State Bakersfield on Nov. 
16. UCSD's women won 189-111 
whil e its men lost 188-98 . 

The women dominated the 
meet , sweeping the first three 
places in six out of 14 events. 

One of the most impressive 
events of the day was the 400-yard 
individual medley. Sophomore 
Christine Hyjek won in a time of 
4:36.04, and was followed by 
sophomore Kim Rice with a time of 
4:40.91 and junior Denise Bogard 
with a time of 4:42 .40. All three 
swimmers earned National 
Collegiate Athl etic Association B-
cut qualifications. 

Rice had a strong day, winning 
both the 100- and 200-yard back-
stroke. Her time in the 200 was a 
2:10.25, an NCAA B-cut qualifica-
tion and a lifetime best by over two 
seconds. Bogard was also a signifi-
cant co ntributor for the Tritons, 
comi ng in second in the 100-yard 
breaststroke in I :06.3 6, an NCAA 
automatic qualification. 

Sophomore Rosa nna D elurgio 
had some of the strongest swims of 
the day, winning the 100-yard 
breaststroke (I :05.78) and the 200-
yard breaststroke (2:23.38) and 
automatically qualifying for NCAA 
in both events. 

Other NCAA qualifying swims 
included sophomore Francis Tran's 
first place in the 200-yard butterfly 
in a time of 2: 11 .33, freshman 
Sophie Levy's first place in the 
I ,OOO-yard freestyle in a time of 
10:-U.45, and her first pl ace in the 
500 freestyle in a time of 5:13.99. 

The diving squad gave ,1 solid 
performance as well . J enny 
Margrave led the Triton female 
divers, coming in third in the 1-
meter diving and second in the 3-
meter divi ng. 

Although CSUB did not bring 
any male divers to the meet, UCSD 
divers Jason Boehm and Peter 
Nichols competed against each 
other, earning significant points for 
the UCS D men. Boehm won both 
the I -meter diving and the 3 -meter 
diving. 

The UCSD men's squad put up 
its best e ffort against the CSUB 
men. who are three-time defending 
champions in NCAA Division II. 
Despite their loss, the Tritons had a 
successfu l day, with several swim-
mers earning NCAA qualification 
times. 

In the I,OOO-ya rd freestyle, 
UCSD senior Dagart Al lison 's sec-
ond-place time of 9:56.19 was a B-
Cllt qualification, which will all ow 
him to swim in the CM meet if 
he earns an automatic qualiticatioll 
in another event. 

Triton sophomore Michae l 
Baier fini shed second in the 200-
yard freestyle with a rime o f 
1:43 .92, another NCAA B-cut 
qualification. He gor a second B-
cut qualification in the 400-yard 
individual medley, winning in a 
time of 4: 10.24. 

Other notable swims included 
sophomore Steve Nishiyama'S sec-
ond place in the 100-yard breast-
stroke in 1:01.91 and junior Jesse 
Ford's second place in the 200-yard 
breaststroke in 2: 13 .96, finishing 
just behind CSUB's Carl Crawford 
(2: 12. 12). UCS D freshman 
Amadeus Regucera came in third 
in the 400-yard indivi dual med ley 
with a personal best 01'4:15. 13. 

Sophomore Brad)! Gos ling 
ca me in fourth in the 200-yard 
freestyle in I :45.43, which was an 
"outstanding time for him ," 
accordi ng to Triton head coach 
Scott McGi hon. 

Ge tting so many NCAA quali -
fi cat ions this ea rly in the season is 
rem arkable and heralds a success-
ful year for UCSD swimming and 
diving. 

" I think the team did an e.\lra-
ordinary job chee ring-wise and in 
pe rfo rm ance," UCSD women 's 
co-captain Carolyn Kwok said of 
both the men's and the women's 
tea ms. "They've been training 
really hard and it's been very 
in spiring seeing them a ll step lip to 
the challengt:s put fort h through 
this mee t despite bt:ing broken 
down and fati gued." 

After several months of hard 
traini ng, the UCSD swimmers will 
ease up fo r several weeks to prepare 
for the Speedo Cup from Dec . 5 
through Dec. 7. 

"We arc going to rest for that 
meel and see how many CM 
standard s we can get," McGihon 
said. 

Since most of the teams at the 
Speedo Cup will be Division I 
squads such liS UC Berkeley, 
Stanford and UCLA, the team's 
focus will be ge tting individll.ll 
bests and qual ifying times for 
NCAA. 

The UCSD men 's and women's 
diving teams will next compete at 
the UCLA Diving Invitational 
fromJan . 17 through Jan. 18.

Determined Tritons like defender Molly 
Carlson and nlidfielder Amy Goker decisively 
defeated each early UC Davis attempt to cap-
ture a goal. 

"We kept them from shooting from the 35 
yards mark," McManus said. 

Nevertheless, the Aggies answered the brief 
Tri ton lead two minutes after UCSD's goal 
with a shot from UC Davis player Shannon 
Mally, who headed the ball off a cross from 
teammate Kristin Patterson. 

At the end of the first half, the teams were 
still tied, but the Aggies made many dogged 
rushes to the goal. 

"Davis pummeled us first half, but we came 

back second (halfl," Jones said . 
The ball was shuttled down the field quickly 

by key players like forward Shannon Harrelson 
and midfielder Kristina de la Rosa several times 
during the second half, but the ball was defiantly 
kick.ed back. across the field each time. 

Midfielder Jackie Shaffer and defender 
Heather Szafraniec displayed well-honed abili-

T he score was sti ll 1- 1 after regulation, 
forcing overtime. When the game couldn 't be

overtimes to decide things if there's still day-
ligh t." 

Although the Tritons did not expect the 
game to come to a series of penalty shots, they 
did practice them earlier. 

"Jamie (Lautschleger, UCSD 's goalkeeper}, 
was close to every shot, was confident, and 
loves a challenge," Jones said . 

Each team had five penalty kicks that were 
to be made by five different players. 

The final penalty kick by Aggie Cynthia Rail, 
UC Davis' offensive Most Valuable P layer, 
entered the goal, resulting in UC Davis being 
able to advance into the quarterfinal round of the 
2002 NCAA Division II Championships . 

During the game, the Aggies had 19 foul s, 
while UCSD o nly committed 12. Oftentimes, 
the Aggies fought against Triton rallies with 
kicks, pull s and pushes on UCSD players and 
their clothing. 

Triton defender Christine Wensel retaliated 
at one point with a push, but was promptly 
given a yellow card by the referee. 

UC Davis was also plagued by bad kicks, bur 
made up for it with constant substitutions to 
keep their energy level high. 

The Aggies had over twice the number of 
shots per period than the Tritons, but UCSD 
had more than double the amount of corner 
kicks, most of which were taken during the sec-
ond half of tilt: game. 

Both teams failed to capitalize on several 
chances to score because each team knew the 
strengths and weaknesses of the other. 

"They were not dangerous shots, bur Da vis 
definitely had (missed) scoring opportunities, 
too," J ones said of the Aggies' attempts to get 
more goals. 

UCSD and UC Davis played each other 
twice ea rlier this season, and Tritons bested the 
Aggies each ti me. 

" In the back of my mind, [ thought we 
would win," W ensel said. 

UCSD was disheartened by the loss, espe-
cially after playing a tough game. 

"I was crushed, especially seeing the other 
team celebra te on our home turf," Jones said. 

T he Aggies will advance to face Color,ldos 
Metro State next weekend in the national quar-
terfinals. 

Talking is 
good for the 

game 
concinued from pa~e ~o 

Ali had a solid right to sing :Ind talk 
trash. 

Had Ali talked himself up as 
much as he did and then 10 t a box-
ing match , he would be nowhere 
near greatness. In faer, I would be 
tempted to call him the "worst." 

You can't talk trash and then not 
back it up. I can't help bur laugh at 
the people I see on the playground 
talking about their "mad skills" 
before stepping onto the court , 
where they later show during the 
game that they actua lly havc no 
skill s. 

But at least they tried to ralk 
trash . At leas! they 'gave the game 
some meaning. Trash talking 
brings out the best competitive 
spirit fro m all athletes, and the 
game all of a sudden has purpose. 
The addresser has somethin!! to 
prove, and the addressee has a' les-
son to try to teach . 

Talking trash always lights a ti re 
beneath anyone who hears YOll . and 
the flame won'l go out until you 
come our on top (or until ynl! take 
a pummeling and hit the Illat like 
Liston did).

'Defending champs 

UCSD's women's soccer team doesn't capitalize on opportunities in

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

In the National Coll egiate Athletic Association Far 
West Regional Final on Nov. 17, the UC Davis Aggies 
managed to OUSt formerly No.6-ranked U SD in an 
electrifying double-overtime game thar cul minated in a 
penalty kick shootout that resulted from the score being 
tied 1-1 after 110 minutes of play, T hl: loss ended the 
Tritons' hopes of three-peating as Division II nJtional 
champions. 

"The game could have gone either way, bur rhe girls 
played well and it was a great 1:(ame," Triton head coach 
Brian McManus said . 

T he ga me saw UCSD step up ItS game each half and 
then lIltensified its energy dUTlng each overtime period. 

T he ole Triton goal was scored by rmdtielder Sarah 
Shopbach with assists from fo rward Krrstln Jones and

'eawolves a t SSU in their Ocr. 12 

matchup, the Tritons ca me out 
plaYlllg hard and dominated the 
fi rst I!ame 30-_1 on ~ov. is. 

' r he UCS D defense was domi-
nant as It racked up i4.5 toral team 
blocks on a night that Brianna 
Koche, Katie Hogan, j essica Bartter 
and Bonnie Wilson combined for 22 
block assists. Despite the defense, 
the Tritons struggled in game two as 
they committed 10 attack errors to 
only 13 kills and fell 27-30. 

UCS D head coach Duncan 
McFarland blamed a sense of over-
confidence for the lapse. 

"In the second game, I think we 
got to thinking that it might be kind 
of easy to beat this team," he said. 

UCSD improved its passing in 
game three and the results were 
immediate, Setter Teresa Ohta con-
tinued to pour on the assists on her 
way to 48 on the evening and also 
picked up a match-high 19 digs. 

The Tritons' 30-21 victory in 

ga mc three was also due in part to 
the strong cffort off the bench from 
oll tside h itter Ash lev Peterson, who 
picked up nine ki lls' while attacki ng 
.533 and ~ave UCSD a boost. 

""Vha t 1 saw was the lack of 
energy," Peterson sa id . "I knew that 
wc had to tu rn up the energy if we 
wanted to win ."
