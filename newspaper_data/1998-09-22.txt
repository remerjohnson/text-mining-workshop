Model School 
Set to Open 
In Fall 1999 
DONATION: Regent Peter 
Preus and family donate $5 
million toward school 
By Vincent Gragnani 
Staff Writer 

The U SO Model chool sits on the 
verge of becorlling a reality, as it is now 
within $3 million of the $13.1 million 
required to open its doors to students in th 
fall of 1999. 

Oave Lubltz/ Guardian 
WELCOME: Revelle freshman Larry Chen (red shirt, waving) was in good spirits after 
waiting an hour and a half in line to get his keys on move-in day Saturday. 

During the summer, the UC Board of 
Regents approved the creation of the UCSD 
Model School, allowing UCSD to enter into 
negotiations with the San Diego Unilied 
School District to establi 'h and allocate 
funds for the school. 

MOVE-IN received complaints from par-ents whose children arc not bei ng housed within their col-lege. Barrett said that in the hous-
ing brochures the university 
implies that students wi ll be 
housed in the college in which 
they are ellrolled. Barrett sug-
gested "publishing more of a 
reality brochure than a market-
ing brochure," to clarify. 

The San Diego School Board approved 
the charter for the Model School on ept. 8. 
The school is still pending approval from 
the state Board of Education. 

The e ·tablishment of a Model School is 
one of several measures taken by UCSD to 
increase the number of underrepresented 
students on campus. The school will offer 
co llege preparatory education for under-
achieving, high-potential students from low-
income communities in San Diego. DORMS: Housing shortage leads to cramped 

quarters and temporary living arrangements 
At Revelle 's Argo Hall 

many students are being 
housed outside of their col-
lege. The third 1100r, plus some 
fou rth and Ii fth 1100r dorms, 
house Roosevelt students. 

UC Regent Peter Preuss, who said in the 
July Board of Regents meeting that the pro-
posal was "a beauty," and his ·family gave 
this summer's largest single contribution to 
the UCSD Model School of this summer on 
July 28. In recognition of the gift of $5 mil -
lion, UCSD plans to name the school The 
Preuss School at UCSD. 

By Vincent Gragnani and 
Christine Pangan 
Staff Writers 

For the second year in a 
row, incoming freshmen at 
UCSD will be temporarily 
housed in crowded accommo-
dations and many others will 
be forced to live off campus 
due to an ever-increasing 
housing shortage. 

Housing and Dining 
Services Administration 
Director Larry Barrett sa id 
that the shortage is a matter of 
concern . 

"Anytime you can' t house 

students who want to live on 
campus, it creates it concern 
on my part ," Barrett said. "To 
some parents, it 's a very seri-
ous matter." 

Though hundreds are on 
waiting lists, Barrett said that 
all freshmen who met the 
proper deadlines were given 
spaces. Parents of students not 
given spaces were ~till upset, 
Barrett added. 

Barrett said that he was 
unable to remedy the situations 
because there were so many 
Illany requests for housing. 

Barrett said he has also 

The parents of Roosevelt 
freshman Courtney Hughes 
sa id they were initially very 
di sappointed that their daugh-
ter would be living at Revelle. 

"We even sent it I the hous-
ing application I in ~o early," 
Martha Hughes said. 

Courtney Hughes, howev-
er, said she is not faled by her 
li vi ng si tuation.

"The Preuss family is proud to be 
involved in this spectacular new program at 
UCSD," Peggy Preuss said, speaking on 
behalf of her family. "We consider it a priv-
ilege to help chi ldren reach their potential , 
and we believe that all children deserve an 
opportunity to do their best. 

'The Model School promises new, innova-
tive approaches to helping young people," she 
added. 'The insights gained in this exciting

Funding varies for these cere-

the organization itself. sometimes 
coming from a pool of money gen-

available to all student organiza-

Santa Barbara 14th. . 

LJCSD moved up one place in this year's rank ing for 
the nation 's top universit ies, both private and publ ic, 
from 33rd to 32nd. Harvard University, Princeton 
University and Yale University t ied for first place fol· 
lowed by MIT and Stanford University.

financial resources, graduation rates and alumn i giv· 
ing rates, as well as other criteria. 

UCSD Ranked Third in Federal 
Research and Development 
Expenditures for 1996 

In a recently released report by the National 
Science Foundation, UCSD ranked th ird in the nation

International Rheumatology Prize 

Two arthrit is specialists from the UCSD School of 
Medicine , Gary Firestein and Nathan Zvai fler, were 
selected for the 1998 Caro l Nachman Prize for 
Rheumatology in June. The international award is 
granted in recognition of outstanding innovative c1ini·

gene de fects associated with rheumatoid arthrit is, a 
common and debilitat ing disease that affects two mil· 
lion Americans. 

UC Campus Crime Drops to a 10-
Year Low for All Nine Campus 

The number of major crimes reported to the FBI

puses decreased by more than 11 percent, falling to 
the lowest level in more than a decade. 

The drop in the University of Californ ia's 1997 
overall crime rate included a 12 percent decrease in 
property crimes - burglary, theft, motor veh icle theft 
and arson. Violent crime - homicide , rape, attempt· 
ed rape , robbery and aggravated assault - increased 
6 percent, but represented less than 2 percent of the 
total number of crime s occurring at the university's 
nine campuses.

STUDENT CENTER Is SECRET 
OASIS OF COLLEGE LIFE 

COMMENTARY: While 
the rest of UCSD is 
devoid of character, the 
Student Center 
is teeming with life 

By Marc Comer 
Opinion Editor 

Once the hea rt of UCSD, the 
Student Center is the only place on 
campus with a genuine college atmos-
phere. 

Sinl:e the establi hment of the Price 
Center, which took over as the center 
of campus years ago, the Student 
Center has become a retreat for upper· 
classmen and graduate students alike. 
Nestled in a grove of trees between 
Mandevi lle, Bonner Hall and the old 
gym. it is a place of healthy food , 
cheaper prices, eXl:ellent coffee, ecleL:' 
tic musil: and engaging, happy people. 
It is UCSD's secret oasis of L:ollege 
life. 

At the end of my sophomore year I 
stumbled across the Student Center 
not knowing that I would lind myself 
spending more time there than any· 
where else on I:alllpus. I wish I had 
discovered it earlier. 

The Student Center is a mystery to 
most underclassmen_ Fear not rresh·

COMMENTARY: 
Illiterate parents and 
problem-ridden 
schools are responsible 
for poor reading kills 
By Jeffrey M, Barker 
Associa te Opinion Editor 

One in five San Diegan~ cannot 
read this sentenl:e - and it 's our 
fault. 

The responsibi lity of teaching 
our neighbors to read lies on the 
houlders of our schools and edu-

cators , as well as on those of the 
entire literate community. 

lIIiteracy is not just a San Diego 
problem. Close to one-fourth of all 
Californians over age 16 cannot 
read above a fourth-grade level. 
acwrding to a newly released 
report by the National Institute for 
Literacy. 

Adapted from numbers gathered 
by the U.S. Department of' 
Education National Adult LiteraL:Y 
Survey, the report breaks down lit -
efal:Y by community. showing sev-
eral areas of San Diego with signif-
icant problems. National City, one 
of San Diego 's more ethnically 
diverse L:ommunities. has an illiter-
acy rate of 36 perL:ent. This percent-
age is similar to numbers reported 
from all over Los Angele County, 
where. 111 concert with the adult 
population, grade schools scream 
with reading-skills problems. 

The Stanford 9 grade-sL: hool 
examinations administered last 
spnng revealed that 71 percent of 

third·grader~ in Los Angeles 
County cannot read at their grade 
leve l. Worse yet , two-thirds of 
those students cannot read at all , 
reported the LlH Allgeles Tillie.\' ("A 
Long Road BaL:k From Reading 
Crisis," Sept. 13, 1998). 

uch resu Its come from a state 
ranked dead last in reading sk ills

California. Many immigrants must 
learn to speak English before they 
I:an read it. The National Institute 
for Literacy survey does not men· 
tion San Marcos' large Latino pop-
ulation when it reports the city'S 
adult illiteracy rate at 25 percent. 
This lal:k of information illustrates 
the diffiL:ulties that exist in attack· 
ing the problem. 

"You have to look at ethniL: 
makeup to understand literacy rates 
from I:ommunity to community," 
said Jose Cruz, director of the San 
Diego Council on Literacy, the lead 
organization in the 10l:a l literaL:Y 
effort . The report shows Iiteral:Y 
ex pert s where to concentrate their 
efforts. Cruz added. 

Literacy programs and volunleer 
efforts. like those that Cruz's (;Oun-
I:i I represents, are a temporary ban· 
dage for America's literacy wound, 
aL:cording to John Corcoran. 

A San Diego County resident 
who has turned hi s personal hallie 
against illiteracy into one again~t 
America 's, Corcoran, 62, st i II t:on · 
siders himself ··an emerging liter· 
ate." Nationally rel:Ognized as a 
leader in the light for a literate 
America , he points the finger at the 
school system. 

Having graduated from hi gh 
sC llool and college. attained a 
California teaching credential and 
taught in a Southern California 

school distriL:t for 17 years without 
being able to write a senlenL:e, 
Cort:oran knows a thing or two 
about literacy problcm~ in the 
stale's sl:hool system. He advocates 
equipping alltead1ers with the tools 
to teadl ~tudents of all learning: lev-
els. and to hold them al:countah1c. 

Ofwran says he owes IllS lill.:m-
L:y in part to phonics. Yet. Ihe Los 
Angeles Tillle.l· artide reponed an 
administrator in one Los Angeles 

ounty school district as saying that 
many of his teadlers d n't know the 
tirst thing about teaL:hing phonics. 

While parent s, philosophers, 
politicians and voters lOSS around 
theorie ' of education, the teachers 
arc in the classrooms with the read· 
ers. Too many hands in ihe lesson 
plan contribute to the state's educa-
tional chaos. 

Voters ' approval of Proposition 
227 abolished bilingual education 
in California, yet bilingual educa-
tion is still very much alive in at 
least one elementary school. A 
first-grade classroom at Discovery 
Elementary in San Marcos is dew· 
rated with- posters wrillen in 
Spanish. The teacher gives instruc-
tion in both English and Spanish. 

Both Cruz and CorL:oran place 
importam;e on the home front , 
equating parents with teachers and 
the home with the dassroom. 
Unfortunately, many L:hildren who 
do not receive adequate instruction 
in school and go home to illiterate 
parents cannot fill in the gaps on 
their own. 

They arc baL:k to page one. 
To so lve the reading dilemma. a 

(ombinalion of improvemenl in 
schools and increa~ed volunteerislll 
in adult· literacy programs needs to 
be organi led. 

Schools need to raise the bar of 
standards and not give up until each 

~tudent can easily vault over it. 
When the kid~ walk home with syl-

U.S. SIDESHOW SEEN THROUGH A FOREIGN LENS 
COMMENTARY: The 
world has a different 
view of U.S. politics 
By Laura Knighten 
Senior Staff Writer 

Before beginning thi ~ article, 
perhaps I should say thank you to 
those few readers who, not ren-
dered apathetic hy a media-induced 
overdose of breaking report~ and 
redundant opinions on the pre .. i-
dential scandallside~how, actually 
read thi s piece. 

Somehow in the never-ending 
barrage of stori es, opinions and 
opinion polls of the si tuation, one 
imponant question often gets over-
looked: How does the rest of the 
world percei ve the so-called 
Zippergate, and consequently the 
American public'! While Americans 
may grow weary of the scandal, 
they must remember that this news 
reaches an oUiside world that often 
fails to understand the controversy. 

As a world power and interna-
tional leader, President Clinton's 
fate potentially affects th~ rest of 
the world. Furthermore, any action 
taken by Congress against the pres-
ident cou ld seriously impair the 
U.S. 's international standing. 

As such, the world - especial-
ly Europe - wat.ches the unfolding 
events carefully and cri tically. Any 
procedures that follow the release 
of the Starr report wi ll most cer-
tainly be viewed as an important 
tes t of an already strnined 
American political system . 

One needs only to peruse the 

.. 

Internet to witness the worldwide 
pr minence of President Clinton's 
current troubles. Newspapers such 
as the Irish Ttmes and EI Mundo 
carry full copies of the Starr report 
and the White House rebullal on 
their web pages. EI Mundo even 
translated the repon and rebuual into 
Spanish in order to aid its readers 
and faci litatc discussion for teachers. 

The newspaper also polled it~ 
t:iectronic readers, aski ng whether 
President Clinton should resign for 
hi~ role in the "ca~e of Lewin~ky. " 

ot ~urpri~ing ly , the re,ult, indi-
cated that only 27.42 percent think 

Pre~idellt Clinton should re~lg n , 
while 72.58 percent believe he 
, hould remain in olTice. 

Though the main focus of my 
argument concerns Europe, speci li -
cally Ireland, newspapers through-
out the world - from the 

etherlands 10 Peru - cany promi-
nent articles on President Cli nton ' ~ 
current woes. Clearly, many w un-
tries are monitoring the si tuation 
with an allentive and cri tica l eye. 

This atlention may be atlributed 
to the fact that President Clinton 
proves to be an enormously popu-
lar president in the European arena. 
Much of hi s work and policy bring 
benefit to thi s region. 

Ir\:land, my home for nine 
months this past year. serves as an 
exce llent example. The pres, in 
Ireland strongly support s President 
Clinton th rough the scandal , large-
ly hecause of hi s work toward 
securing the rece nt Good Priday 
peace agreement in Northern 
Ireland. Certainly. Clinton deserves 

carrying case 

While Americans 
may grow weary of 
the scandal, they 
must remember that 
this news reaches an 
outside world that 
often fails to 
understand the 
controversy. 
the pmise for any role he played in 
bringing pe<lce; <I sex scandal a lonc 
docs not undermine or inhibit a 
pcrson's ability to le<ld. 

As Irish Ttllle.l· writer Vincent 
Browne stated in an Aug. 5 column. 
"It is one thing for us, members of 
the public, to be intrigued by sa l<l -
cious gossip. But for the political 
syMcm of the most powerful nation 
in the world to be transfixed by 
, uch tri via is something elsc. 

That a prcsident should be Judged 
on whether he had sex with ,Ill intem 
and lied about it. rather than on hi s 
management of the urgent interna-
tional issues. including the ~ tate of 
the peace ,clllelllent in Northern

Ireland, is an ex pression of contempt 
for the rest of the world." 

Browne further describes the 
world as looking "askance" at the 
"derai led" American political sys-
tem. Browne, like many others, fails 
to see the more fundamental issue 
behind the conceded ly tawdry 
details - the possi hle criminal act 
of lying under oath and obstruction 
of justice. From this view, the inves-
tigation. Ken Starr and the "di ~tmct­
cd" American people become 

ridic ulou ~. Not only does thc world 
watch, itlaug h~ ," well. 

Morcover. Jonathan Freedland 
describc~ thl.! sr.:andal in his Aug. 21 
column forthe Irish TImes as "Ia rthe 
Jerry Spri ngcr era," U~ if to say that 
President Cl inton IS si mply a victim. 
hijacked in a tcll -alll<llk show. 

"Republic<ln die-hards." slates fel-
low columni st Joe Qlrrollon Aug. 19. 
simply "are not ready to let a severe-
ly wounded President oil the hook 
just yel." In this view, President 
Clinton has bcr.:o l11c the victim of a 
political witch-hunt by the leaders or 
a sr.:andal-hungry society. 

Perhaps even more astounding is 
a Sept. 16 Sail Diego Union-
Tribllne arti c le, which cites an 
op inion poll for the French maga-
line Le Poil/I . An astonishing 58 
percent of th ose polled believe 
President Clinton was right to lie 
ahout the relationship with 
Lewinsky. 

Yet, what ITIilny Europeans. and 
~ome Americans, fail to appreciate 
is that the Starr report is not mere ly 
ahoUl sex. Nor is it about a white lie. 
Instead. Preside nt Clinton's reril 

lies in the possibility that he lied 
both under oath and directly and 
repeatedly to the American people. 

[s a lie to the public grounds for 
impeachment? Maybe nol. What 
about a lie under oath? More proba-
ble. ~ it is a crime that every other 
ci tizen would receive some son of 
punishment for commilling. 

Very few people actually can.! 
who sleeps with whom in 
Washington poli ti ca l circles. Each 
ci ti zen. however. should care about 
electing a leader who can be trust-
ed. President Clinton "misled" the 
public and j udi cial bodies for seven 
months. Yet. it came as no surprise 
when he admilled to an "inappro-
priate" rclationshi p. As elec ted 
ofllcials - from local sc hool board 
members 10 the hi ghest rung of the 
hierarchy. the pres ident - these 
leaders act on behalf of the 
America n peoplc. Americans 
should demand no lower a standard 
of integrity: If they expect less. 
they will certainly receive less. 

From my own experience of li v-
ing abroad during the months in 
which the scandal unfolded. I can 
understand the European perspec-
tive. Havi ng only a few out-of-con-
text snippets of American news. it 
was diflicult to realize the severity 
of the allegations. Everyone 
laughed , and I joined in - just 
another politi cian in trouble. Even 
upon retuming home. while others 
around me ranted against or defend-
ed President Clinton. I experienced 
difllcu lty even caring.

INTERN WAITING FOR THE PUNCH LINE 
COMMENTARY: 
Lewinsky is someone 
the American people 
should identify with 
By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Senior Staff Writer 

"Intern'? You 're an intern '! 
Really, du you knuw Bill '!" 
(C huckle). 

My god. It seems like I spent the 
entire summer explaining that no. 
even though I interned for the State 
Department this summer, I had 
absolutely no contact with the pres-
ident. 

I'm sure that what I experiem:ed 
wasn't unique. It seems like every-
one I've talked to who interned this 
summer spent at least 5 percent of 
thei r time forcing a smile as a bar-
rage of people told them the same 
intern jokes over and over again. 

I didn't tind them funny the first 
time, and I sure don 't tind them 
funny now. 

The reason why these jokes gi ve 
me the chills is more complicated 
than them just being lousy. I guess 
it's because after thi s summer. I 
know what it's like to be an intern, 
and I' m quite aware of the differ-
ence in power and control between 
interns and pretty much everyone 
in government. Yes, interns are. 
without a doubt, comfortab ly seat-
ed at the very bottom of the peck-

ing order. 
What bothers me the most 

about these jokes is that they all 
imply. in some way or another, that 
Monica Lewinsky is a slut , a 
woman whom the American peo-
ple should not feel so rry for, let 
alone identify with. 

Unfortunately, I do identify with 
her, and no, it's not because I had 
any sort of relationship with any-
one whi le interning. I identify with 
her because we both were interns 
and because I know that we shared 
simi lar job duties, such as answer-
ing the mail. 

In addi lion, I know what it feels 
like to be in a job where no one 
knows your name and refers to you 
simply as "the intern." I know what 
it feel s like to be asked to do almost 
anythi ng and to know how to do 
very little. 

Please understand that I really 
enjoyed spending the summer 
interning. However, I also interned 
long enough to realize that nobody 
would ever want to be an intern for 
life . 

With the job title " intern" comes 
a pennanent inferiority complex. 
You never know what you might be

power. 
imagine what it must have been 
like for Lewi nsky when the pres i-
dent took an interest in her. Heck, 
here's a guy who's nut just parl of 
the team - he is the team. Could 
you even imagine what it must 
have been like for Lewi nsky to 

have the president nirting with her? 
The Starr Report states that at 

one point Lewinsky "ran into the 
president in the West Wing base-
ment and introduced herself again, 
land] according to Ms. Lewinsky, 
he responded that he already knew 
who she was." 

I truly think I would faint if the 
president. who I had only met 
brieny, told me he remembered 
me. 

Knowing what it's like to be an 
intern, I highl y doubt that 
Lewinsky was able to "seducc" the 
presi dent. The Starr report seems 
to support my theory. In their first 
romantic encounter, it was Clinton 
who invited Lewinsky into his pri-
vate office. There. he alleged ly 
asked Lewinsky if he could kiss 
her, ard the rest is history (or at 
least a really bad made-for-TV 
movie) . 

I am a bit curious why the jokes 
haven' t changed if evidence has 
surfaced that portrays Lewinsky as 
something more than just easy. 

Maybe it 's because nobody can 
handle seei ng Lewinsky as vu lner-
ab le instead of manipulative. If we 
allow that Lewinsky could very 
well just ' be impressionable. the 
story gets a bit more depressing. 

I've never met anyone who 
wasn't impressed by celebrities. 
I've never spoken with anyone who 
cou ld claim that they wouldn't be 

Do you suffer from 

excited about the prospect of meet-
ing Bill Clinton or Madonna. Heck, 
most of us are thrilled when we run 
into a local or les well-known 
ce lebri t y. I know that it made my 
day when [ ran into Val Kilmer this 
summer. 1 have a friend that never 
stops talking about her brief 
cm:ounter with Wallace Shawn 
(Vizzini in "The Princess Bridc") 
fi ve years ago. 

Face it. we all would be excited 
if President Clinton recognized us. 
Yes . we may not all sleep wi th him 
or even necessarily flirt with him (I 
know I wouldn' t), but 99 percent of 
us would be thrilled to have been 
rewgnized by him. 

By realizing that Lewinsky is in 
many ways like us: we also have to 
recognize this whole affair (no pun 
intended) is something more than 
just politics. It touches on a very 
sensitive part of the American psy-
che - our obsession with celebri-
ties and power. 

Reali zing this, 1 hope you can 
understand why I have so much 
trouble laughing at Lewi'nsky 
jokes. In order to laugh at someone, 
you need to feel removed from 
them. You need to be able to see 
them as something that 's n t quite 
human , more of a caricature. 
Unfortunately, with regard to 
Monica Lewinsky, I just can't do 
that. I don' t think that you can, 
either.

On top of that, owners can increase thei r 
prices to compete with gas competitors or, 

with lower prices. 
It 's something we all leam about early 

on: competition in the marketplace, supply 
and demand. Stations with prices thaI we. as 
a collective penny-pinching public, deem

AI2 OPIN ION The UCSD Guardian 

VOTING FOR PEOPLE LIKE You 
COMMENTARY: We 
should look past pretty 
faces and likability 
when choosing leaders 
By Jeffrey M. Barker 
Associate Opinion Editor 

On the elementary sl.:hool bas-
ketball court, fifth -g rade boys line 
up. 

Two team I.:a ptain~ fat:e the 
queue, pointing and weighing ne 
boy again st another. The tall guy i~ 
the firs t I.: hosen. Even before best-
friend loyalt y, the boy who never 
misses a shot is drafted. 

It makes sense. The best fi ft h-
grader for the job gets elet:ted. 0 
matter how good-looki ng another 
would-be bailer is, hi s skills are 
weighed first. One kid might be 
able to pitdl himself like a sea-
soned advertising exel.:uti ve, but 
once the ball touches hi s hands, the 
rest of the boys see through hi s 
salesman facade. 

Why don ' t we choose our lead-
ers thi s way" Why don ' t we con-
ider who would be best for the job 

when chel.:k ing boxes on the elel.:-
tion ballot'! 

Ameri l.:ans vote politicians into 
office for the wrong reasons. Thus, 
we have only ourselves to blame 
for our elected official s' failures. 

Adverti sing campaigns epito-
mize this, feeding on our impulses 
and bad del.: isions. Television com-
mercials shove candidates into Ol,lr 
homes, focusing on thei r pretty 
faces rather than their qualifica-
tions. Fliers in the mailhox tell us 

that politicians care about what is 
i mponant to us. They tell us what 
we want to hear. 

Negative campaigns operate in 
the same way. It's not argued that 
the other candidate is unqualified 
for Ihe job, bu t that they aren't like 
you - they don ' t want what you 
want. 

Why did we vote in ou r current 
chief executive" Becau~e. we 
thought "hey' He's like me'" 
Dancing on stage with a saxo-
phone, who couldn 't like the guy. 
And he's handsome, i~n't he'! 

Was the late Sonny Bono, 
though one of thi s nation 's best 
Congressmen, originall y elected 
into Palm Spri ngs' mayor's olTi ce 
because o r hi s I nos musical 
celebrity status'! 

To funher the point that we vote 
for the wrong reasons, politicians 
spend increasingly less of thei r 
time in their offices and more time 
making sure that we like them. 

On the basketball court, one of 
the fifth graders t:an't dribble as 
well as the team captai n thought. 
He talks more than he plays. The 
whole team blames the captain for 
choosing the guy, and the I.:aptain 
blames himse lf. 

But when an elected ofliciaillubs 
the politil.:al ball, we don't look to 
ourselves as captains who chose the 
wrong guy. We blame him. 

We should vote with grade-
school common sense, not with 
high st:hool clique mentality. locks 
stick with jOl.:ks, the pep club mem-
bers hang out with other pep club 
memhers, RepUblicans stick to

a trend - a politi cal tactic during 
election time. Just how many of 
these guys have we elected? 

What 's worse is the ridiculou~ly 
low voter turnout in our su pposed 
democracy. This is not a I.:Op-out -
it 's not to say that those who vote 
arc doi ng their duty no matter how 
they come to a decision. This only 
puts more rcspon~ibi lit y on the 
sh ulders of the voter to make a 
well -educated deci~io n ror the 
whole. 

Voting is a responsibi lity that 
r' lll glad Illany people opt out of. 
There is a responsibi lity to weigh 
candidates by ski ll and proven abi 1-
ity and to t:hoose the individual 
who wi II run oflit:e best. 

We continue to look for politi -
cians who arc like ourselves and 
who are sc ripted to say they care 
about the issues we do. And we wi ll 
continue to find ones who, li ke our-
selves, will make mi stakes. 

When the next government offi -
cia l holds a press conference to

remember whal we thought was so

ABROAD: 
Refocusing the 
national attention 
Continued from page 6 
changed had I been in the U.S. 
du ring the seven months of 
denial? Perhap ' I wou ld have felt 
more anger or betrayal (or any-
thing at all) if President Clinton 
had looked at me through my 
te l evi~ion set, asked me to tru ~t 
him and then told me that he did 
nOI have sex wi th "that woman." 

In truth. I have been intlu-
enl.:ed by these European views. 
That Ihe world is learning about 
the sexual habits of our presi -
dent is both unnecessary and 
embarrass ing. However, now 
that the report has been 
released, the allegations of per-
jury and other crimes simply 
cannot be ignored. 

Whik: the world laughs. let 
the constitutionall y determined 
process take its <.:ourse. Allow 
Congress to judge President 
Clinton's guilt, innocence or sta-
tus somewhere in between. As a 
country we must tread carefull y 
to ensure both justi<.:e and a 'cal m 
resolution to the current specta-
cle. Only then can we refocus 
our national attention 10 issues, 
both foreign and domestic, that 
arfel:t more than the political 
career of one man. 

Our national sanity demands 
a step back and eventually a res-
olution to the politil:al l:i rl.:us. 
Equqlly as important, is remem-
bering that the rest of the world 
is watching, and judging, in lhis 
latest test of the American pol iti -
cal system.

Dynes Gives Talk 
SPEECH: Chancellor discusses diver ity, 
Division n in State of the Univer ity address 
By Leena Shankar 
News Editor 

In a speech that both renected 
on the events of the pa~t academ-
il: year and highlighted plans for 
the year to come, Chancellur 
Robert Dynes gave hi s State of 
the University address on July 13 
to an audience of most ly tall, 
some faculty and a handful of stu -
dents. The addres~ touched on 

~everal i~sues induding the new 
Model School, UCSD's move 10 
Division II sports and Dynes ' 10 
point diversity plan. 

Dynes opened hi s speech by 
offering hi s rellections on the pre-
vious school year. 

"It's been a pretty exciting and 
dynamic year, and challenging 
too," he said. "I feel good about 
the way we arc addressing issues 
- open and hone~l. " 

Dynes said that over the ~um­
mer, he asked a committee to 
address UCSD's K-12 outreach in 
San Diego, 

"It's a success if we prepare 
our youth for [top I st:hools," he 
said. "We have li teral ly thousands 
of people who want to volunteer 
in this erfort." 

In his speech Dynes also men-
tioned the design and implemen-
tation of the Center for Research 
in Education Eq uity, Assessment, 
and Teat:hi ng Excellence. 
(C.R.E.A.T.E.), as a part of the K-
12 outreach plan. .R.EAT.E 
played an instrumental role in the 

creation or UCSD's newly devel-
oped Model School. The school 
will caler to students in grades 6-
12. Students must meet three cri -
teria in order to qualify for admis-
Ion . 

"One, that they arc from a low 
Income family : two, that neither 
parent went to co llege; three, that 
th ey arc highly motivated ," 

Dyne~ said. 
The Model St:hool is also a 

part of Dynes' 10 point di versity 
plan that he announced in June. 
Having named himself the cam-
pus' chief diversi ty officer, Dynes 
said that he is ~pearheading the 
effort to increa~e diversity on 

campu~. 
"We want to increase under-

graduate scholarships hy 10 per-
cent," Dyne said. "AI~o, we havc 
the top 4 pert:ent propo~al, 
Iwherel the top 4 percent of the 
class in high s<.:hools in San Diego 
and Imperial County are admilled 
to UCSD." 

In his address, Dynes men-
tioned UCSD's rct:ent self-study 
and accreditation prut:ess. 

"The accreditation team was 
extremely impressed. They con-
gratulated us on how well we 
were prepared and how well we 
do as a public research universi-
ty," Dynes ~aid. "They also noted 
that the t:Ollege system is quite 
unique and outstanding."

low income students 
wil1 reap benefits 
Continued from page A3 

This year, freshmen re<.:eived 
the first sc ho lar~hips called Del 
Mar Thoroughbred Club 
Scholar~hip~ . Jared Coates, a 
Revel le freshman from Carl bad, 
said the scholarship inlluem:cd hb 
det:ision to allend UCSD over 
UCLA or UC Berkeley. 

"The s<.:holarship makes a large 
difference because my family is 
pretty low income, and we weren ' t 
~un.: how to pay for college. I like 
UCSD bct:ilU e I can commute, and 
Ihe cost is low," Coates said. 

Pam Wygod, a strong UCSD 
support er and a leader in the 
Thoroughbred community, chaired 
the event and received praise from 
Vice-Chancellor uf Student Affairs 
Joseph Wat son. 

H!lCSD and the students who 
benefit are forever indebted to all 
who worked on Celehrate the 
Champions, e~pel:ia lly Pam 
Wygod," Watson said. "All the sut:-
cess rests with Pam Wygod and her 
team ; she felt that we could raise 
$500,000, and we did ." 

Watson also expressed his grati-
tude for the support Ihat the Del 
Mar racing community has shown 
to UCSD students. 

"1 feel that the Del Mar 

Thoroughbred Club and racing 
community have been extremely 
he lpful to the UCSD community," 
Watson said. 

Wygod said that the opportunity 
to help deserving students motivat-
ed her to devote seven months of 
work [0 Celebrate the Champions. 

"I feci very honored that I was 
given this opportunity; I am just 
thrilled to be able to facilitate [schol-
arship rund -rui~ingJ ," Wygod said. 

She abo ~aid that the event was 
not somelhing just one person 
wuld have coordinated. 

"You always need a leader, but a 
leader needs all the support in the 
world ," Wygod said. "I had a I t of 
~lIpporl." 

The idea of merging the com-
munities of mt:ing and UCSD 
form"d as the brainchild of 
Diret:tor 01' Development in 
Student Affairs Mary Gagliardo. 

"I've always been a rat:ing fan, 
and I \\'as kind of surprised when I 
came to UCSD that there were no 
dcveloped relations between the 
rm:ing community and UCSD," 
Gagliardo said. 

Having seen Celebrate the 
Champions WIllC to fruition, she 
said that the rat:ing community has 
shown great support to UCSD. 

"We have students, and they 
have wealth; they have been very 
gc nerou~ to us in helping to raise 
st:holarships," she said.

ISSUES: 
Student questioned 
timing of Dynes' speech 
Continued from page A16 
over last spring 's decision to move to 
Division II sports, Dynes imparted hi s view 
on Lhe issue during the address. 

"We won two national championshi ps -
volleyball and soccer - so should we be in 
Di vision II'! It carries with it certain con-
cerns, and the faculty voted to proceed." 
Dynes said. "The students were very much 
in support and we are proceeding down the 
road [to Division II] ." 

The chancellor also discussed his hope 
that the move forward in athletics will 
favorably impact the university. 

" I, for one, like to attend sports events ... 
I believe we can contain the nasty parts of 
college sport and build a stronger campus," 
Dynes said. 

He also addressed another controversy 
that gripped the campus last spring - the 
invitation of U.S. House of Representatives 
Speaker Newt Gingrich to speak at the June 
all -campus commencement ceremony. 
Many students and faculty complained last 
year that it was inappropriate for the chan-
cellor to select such a speaker without tlrst 
consulting students. As a result, the chancel-
lor created a committee that will choose 
commencement speakers in the future . 

"I have put in place a committee made up 
of facu lty, students, and staff, to look at the 
process of choosing a commencement 
speaker," he sa id. "In spite of the controver-
sy and debate, these two speakers [President 
Bill Clinton in 1997 and Speaker Newt 
Gingrich in 19981 have given UCSD nation-

The UCSD Guardian 

al and international focus .. . Ithe] visibility 
of UCSD in Washington is much higher." 

In closing, Dynes pointed out that 
UCSD's research funding grants and con-
tracts have increased by 30 percent. 

"We have ranking faculty everywhere ... 
I see us as a center of education, cu lture and 
intelligence. J see us as the model of an 
American university," Dynes said. 

Audience members said they had varied 
reasons for attending the address. Chemistry 
professor Barbara Sawrey said that she 
wanted to hear more on the chancellor 's 
views about diversity issue,. 

"I wanted to hear an update on issu.:s 
regarding affirmative action .. . the Charter 
[Model] School is another thing that I am 
interested in," Sawrey said. "Also, it's a 
good chance to look on the past year." 

During the questions and comments peri-
od at the end of the address, members of the 
Union of Professional and Technical 
Employees voiced their dismay at the high 
turnover rates among staff researchers. They 
demanded that the University of Califomia 
give them the salary increases that other 
employees receive. 

One of the approximately live students in 
attendance asked Dynes why the State of the 
University address was held in July. 

"Why is it that I don 't see any students 
here'! Why not have this during the school 
year'! Are you scared of students?" an 
unidentified student asked. 

Dynes said that he was not scared of stu-
dents and could offer no answer for why the 
address was not scheduled during the school 
year. 

"I have no fear of students and my record 
speaks for that ," he said. "And, I don't know 
why this is held in July." 

REGENTS: 
Connerly vows to end 
legacy admissions 
Continued from page A2 
for an increase in UCSD's Campus Activity 
Fcc. The $6.50 increa~e was passed by the 
student body in last April's student govern-
ment elections and became official after the 
regents authorized it. 

In July, the board also further adjusted 
the university's admissions policies. The 

ommittee on Educational Policy voted 
unanimously in favor of Connerly's propos-
al 10 end the practice of giving university 
admissions to students who would not be 
ac(;epted but for their strong political and 
linancial tics. 

"Admissions mOlivated by concern for 
Iinancial , political or other such benetit to 
the uni versity do not have a place in the 
admissions process," Connerly said. 

Connerly also said that this preferential 
Ireatment was not in keeping with the uni -
versity'S public status. 

"We arc a public institution, and as long 
as we're gelling public money it is our 
responsibility to make sure that factors like 
who you know, who your connections are, 
who w ntributes money, do not weigh into 
the equation [for admissions de(;isions]," 
Connerly said. 

However, the ban is not absolute. The 
policy allows chancellors the discretion of 

Tuesday, September 22, 1998 

admitting students based upon their political 
or financial ties as long as lhe chancellor 
con ults with 'one member of the school's 
academic senate prior to making the deci-
sion . 

Additionally, the ban does not apply to 
the admission of students who do not meet 
the admissions criteria but do possess an 
athletic or musical ability or another talent 
that would be considered an asset to the uni -
versity. The university may also still assist 
students who do nOl qualify for admission 
into the universi ty but have suffered disad-
vantages in their lives. 

The original version of the policy that 
Connerly submi tted in May 1997 was voted 
down due to opposition from some chancel-
lors. That version was a complete ban on the 
practice and would not have permitted any 
discretionary decisions on the part of a 
chancellor. 

During the hearings for this matter, 
Connerly also announced that he planned to 
address the issue of "legacy admissions" to 
the university and whether they are inap-
propriate in admissions policies in the 
future. 

Current university admiss ions policy 
requires out of tate students to have at least 
a 3.4 GPA, which is somewhat higher than 
what is required for a resident - a 3.3 GPA. 
However, if the non-resident has a parent 
who graduated from the university, they are 
judged upon the same guidelines as a resi -
dent student.

"I like it here," she said. "I have 
activities from both (colleges) open 
tome." 

Her mother agreed that the si tu-
ation wasn't as bleak as they 
expected. 

"They did a good job of com-
forting us at orientation that this is 
an ok thing," her mother, Martha 
Hughes, added. "The rooms are 
nice, and newly renovated. Plus, 
next year, we have first option as to 
where Courtney will live, here or at 
Roosevelt." 

Roo evelt sophomore Tiffany 
Simons lived in Argo Hall last year 
and said she chose to do so again 
this year. 

"Last year, we didn't really feel 
connected [to Rooseveltl , but thi s 
year they' re trying to keep beller 
communication," she said. 
"Considering there's such a big 
chunk of [Roosevelt 1 students here. 
we don ' t feel like we're just left -
overs." 

At Muir alone, 31 students are 
being housed in temporary spaces 
according to Muir Resident Dean 
Pat Danylyshyn-Adams. Muir has 
created temporary spaces by hous-
ing four students in rooms intended 
for three and also converting rooms 
designed for student organizations 
into rooms used to house students. 

"We are trying to give this issue 
as much sensitivity as we can," 
Danylyshyn-Adams said. "But stu-
dents will be disappointed with 
thei .. room assignments." 

Despite the seriousness of the

The school will be located on 
eight acres of land east of Interstate 
5, near the intersection of Voigt and 
Genesee Avenue. enabling Model 
School students to access UCSD 
librarie . studios, laboratories and 
recreational facilities. UCSD stu-
dents will serve as interns. tutors 
and mentors for the Model School 
students. 

Until completion of the perma-
nent campus. the school will he 
temporarily housed at the La Casa 
Complex on the Thurgood 
Marshall campus, as well as in 
some modular buildings. Initially, 
the Model School will enroll stu-
dents in grades six through eighl. It 
will add one new grade level per 
year until reaching capacity at 700 
students in 2003 . Oflicials ex pect 
construction to begin in spring 
1999 and to be completed by fall 
2000. 

Model School students wi II be 
chosen hy Inttery from a pool of 
appl icants who shuw academic 
potcnlial and (;Ome from low-
income families. The selected ~Iu ­
dents will also come from ramilie, 
where neither parent has gradualcd

27 students. The Model ellOol will

school days and school years than 
other schools in the San Diego

In addition to the 5 million gift 

by Preuss and his family, the Model 

she expects all students to be in 
permanent spaces by spring quar-
ter. 

"There will be movement 
throughout the quarter," 
Danylyshyn-Adams said. "Some 
students won't even show up." 

Eiel Ragsdale, a Revelle fresh -
man with only one roommate, said 
he was aware that some Revelle 
freshmen will live three to a room 
instead of the intended two. 

"I think it is a crime and an 
indecency to shove so many people 
into a room like pigs in a feed 
yard," he said. 

Ragsdale said he knows of a sin-
gle room had been turned into a 
double. 

Stacy Davis, administrative 
assistant for the Reve lle 
Residential Life Office said the 
number of triple rooms at Revelle 
this year, however. docs not seem 
to be a maj r problem. 

"Last year we had quite a few." 
Davis said. "Thi year there are just 
live triple rooms." 

The housing shortage is not 
only an issue facing UCSD, but one 
affecting many other UC campus-
es, especially UCLA. According to 
Barrell, UCLA residence halls are 
Ii lied to 120 percent capacity com-
pared to UCSD's rate of 104 per-
cent capacity. 

Part of the solution to the prob-
lem involves building new perma-
nent housing. New housing will not 
be available until 2002, when new 
Roosevelt residence halls open to 
accommodate an additional 1,224 
students. 

in search of temporary and 
more immediate solOtions, Barrell 
is chairing a commiltee which will 
issue a report on thclstate of tempo-

Chancellor Robert Dynes said 
he is pleased the Model School has 
received such generous donations. 

"Helen Copley and John and 
Becky Moores have done the uni -
versity a great honor in contribut-
ing these generous gifts toward our 
Model School." UCSD Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes said. "With these 
gi fts , we are now very, very close 
to our ultimate goal, which, when 
achieved. will allow us 10 begin 
reviewing and admitting the first 
class of students next fall . 

" I am hopefu l that the generosi -

others in San Diego to come for-

Thurgood Marshall College 
Provost Ceci I Lytic, a strong propo-
nent of the school from its incep-

and similar schools as an alterna-
tive to the 1993 voucher initiative, 
which would have allowed parents 
to send their children to private 
schools using state vouchers . 

Lytic said the establishment of 
the Model. chool is consistent wi th 
the mission statement of the 
• niversity of alifornia, which 
calls for "a three-pronged approach 
in teaching, research and service to 
extend the I!conomic development

One of the possible solutions is 
to build additional housing on a 
short -term basis that would ac~om­
modate 350 to 380 people, all with-
in a mile of the core of the campus. 

Another possible resolution is to 
remove the housing guarantee for 
second-year students and placing 
those students who want on-cam-
pus housing into a 101lery. 

Danylyshyn-Adams said that 
this year Muir and Revelle offered 
econd-year students in residcnce 

halls a full refund plus $400 if they 
canceled their housing contract by 
Aug. I. Out of the 60 people to 
whom the offer was made, only one 
or two people accepted. 

Danylyshyn-Adams and Barrell 
both said that while it is necessary 
to guarantee housing to first-year 
students, it is not as crucial to make 
the guarantee to second-year and 
transfer students. 

Although st udents claim other-
wise, Rooseve lt Assistant 
Residence Dean Michael Demania 
said Roosevelt students were not 
given the option of being released 
from their housing contracts. 

However, several second-year 
Roosevelt students said they were 
presented with the option. 

"Our RA from last year called 
over the summer and asked if we 
would move out," said one 
Roosevelt sophomore at Pepper 
Canyon apartments who preferred 
not to be named. 

"Everyone we've talked to 
received the same phone call," 
added her roommate. 

Roosevelt sophomore Ian 
Kotchian also said he received the 
same call from his RA.

lU engage in olltn.:ach projects like

"If we don't gt.:1 in volved in 
education, we are not liVing up to

prosperity and s cial tranquillity of

get involved in education and rais-
ing the acudcmic outcome of stu-
dents, I think we' ve violated their 
rights. That is our re 'p nsibility." 

Nonna Trost. the ol11ll1unica-
tions oordinat r for tht.: San 
Diego Unilied School District, said 

she believes the Model School. 
which is an example of a charter 
school, providt.:s a unique environ-
ment 10 study education. 

"We would hope to learn from all 
charter schools," Trost said. "11' thcy 
do things dillen:ntly and do them 
very well, it 's something we want to 
look at. The district is wry stJpporl-
ive of the UCSD (Modell School as 
support for youngsters. We're anx-
ious to see how this goes." 

The UCSD Model School will 
be the !irst of its kind among UC 
schools , said C OI'lice of the 
President Silnior Public 
Information Of/ker Terry Colvin. 

Additionally, Dynes announced 

at the July UC Regents meeting 
that the school would have such 
regular high school activities such 
as an alhletic program. When one 
regent questioned the chancellor on 
the possibility of the Model School 
- wilh such a small enrollment -
having thi s kind of program, Dynes 
replied that it would be a critical 
part or the school. 

"Team spons is an extremely 
important part of high school ," 
Dynes said. "I dOIl ' t see U ' at a di ~­
advantage in athletics ," 

"You don ' t have to win ," Dynes 
continued. in a comment which 
drew laughter from all ides or the 
meeting.

couple hundred dollars plus what-
ever I put in already if I gave up my 
apartment space." he said. 

Kotchian said he chose to 
remain on-campus. 

"It was already the middle of 
summer, so I said no." he said. 
"And I don't have a car." 

Many second-year students are 
choosing to live on-campus 
because the market for off-campus 
housing is very competitive. 

A sociate Director of Housing 
and Dining Services Mark 
Cunningham spends time research-
ing the housing market. 

"We are in a boom market right 
now," Cunningham said. "The new 
developments are high-end lUXUry 
products. We' re just not gelling 
affordable housi ng." 

Cunningham cited a February 
1998 Market Comparison Report 
from the Mesa Student Apartment 
Project Analysis that lists the average 
La Jolla monthly rent for a two bed-
room, two bath apartment as $1 .048. 

Another report compiled by the 
Dec. 1997 i sue of Rental Owner 
lists the apartment vacancy rate of 
various San Diego areas. While 
areas such as City Heights and 
Paradise Hills enjoyed rates above 
9 percent , La Jolla's vacancy rate 
was only 0.5 percent. · University 
Ci ty had a 0.4 percent rate while 
the Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch and 
Sorrento Valley area have 0.2 per-
cent vacancy rate. 

Cunningham said that most of 
the new apartment developments in 
La Jolla are already leased. In such a 
competiti ve market, Cunningham 
said. even if students can afford the 
housing, they will lind it difficult to 
obtain a nine-month lease. 

Cunningham noted Lhat the cur-
rent market boom is vastly differ-
ent from the conditions three to six 
years ago when students had a 
much ea~ier time obtaining afford-
able off-campus housing. 

Barrett said that if trends in stu-
dent enrollment were more pre-
dictable, UCSD could have beller 
prepared for the housing shortage. 
Barrett also said that new housing 
was not planned sooner because 
two years ago there were 150 hous-
ing vacancies on campus. 

SUMMER IN BRIEF ••• 

Fugitive Caught at Port 
Mark Jay Allen, a convict want-

ed in six states on armed robbery 
charges, was caught by UCSD 
Police Officer Michael Jones at the 
Torrey Pines Glider Port on Aug. 
29. Allen had falsi tied credentials 
naming him as an employee of the 
U.S. Marshals and was carrying a 
loaded gun. 

He faces a possible 50-year sen-
tence in his home state. South 
Carolina. 

Jones spotted Allen driving 
erratically in a white Jeep 
Cherokee. Upon checking the 
license plate number. Jones found 
that the vehicle had been stolen 
from Carlsbad a week before. A 
search of Allen's vehicle yielded 
handcuffs, hats and a loaded 9 mm 
semiautomatic pistol. In addition, 
Allen was carrying $7,800 in cash. 

Allen was taken into custody 
and booked into the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center; he was later 
placed in special custody in San 
Diego's federal detention facility. 

UCSD History

INCREASE: 
Budget funds 
science students 
Continued from page A19 

The budget also provides for 
the enrollment of 800 additional 
undergraduates for the UC sys-
tem 's science and engineering 
programs, UCSD will re~eive 
funds for 133 of the 800, This 

i n~ rease is the first step in a plan 
to increase the enrollment of 
these students 40 percent by 
2005, 

Moreover. the governor and 
Legislature have appropriated $6 
million in the 1998-99 budget to 
increase the number of engineer-
ing and computer science faculty 
at the Univ, of California. 

"While $6 million is a tiny 
part of an overall Slate budget of 
$76 billion, it is an important 
step, because the University of 
California's computer science 
and engineering programs have 
played a key role in moving our 
state to the forefront of high tech-
nology," Atkinson said. 

Pryatel also said that this bud-
get wi II exceed the standards set

by the state's higher education 
compact, a plan established four 
years ago to improve the tinancial 
stabi lity of the UC and CSU sys-
tems after Ihe cutbac ks of the 
ear ly 19905. 

The 199!! -99 ti scal year wi ll 
be the tinal year of the wmpa~t. 
Although the funding was sched-
uled to increase by !!3,5 million 
this year. it actually increased 
$340 million - nearly four times 
the intended amount. 

"Presidelll Atkinson said \hm 
this was the best budget of the 
decade. and it 's true." Pryatcl 
said, " It ' much better than early 
on in the bad budget years ." 

Other state offi~ia l s echoed 
this 'entiment. 

"This yea r's budget again 
benelits California's higher edu-
cation status," said Assembly-
woman Denise Moreno 
Ducheny, "We wanted to make 
sure that higher edu~ation reaped

CEREMONY: 
Gingrich supporters 
counterprotest 
Continued from page A1 
graduates marched from the 
library to RIMAC fie ld , where 
festivities were et to take place. 

Protesters donned signs on 
thcir backs which read '·Yes. 
Integration; 0 , Segregation" and 
"Repeal 209, 227", and carried 
banners with si milar ' tatcments 
written on them, They also wore 
red arm bands which. according 
to a flycr posted across campus 
that day, were intended to be "a 
sign of mourning and solidarity 
for all the qualified tudents of 
diverse communities who will be 
denied access to the University of 
California," 

During the first few moments 
of hi s address, the demonstralors 
turned their backs to Gingrich, 
They then quietly tiled out of the 
ceremony, chanting "no universi-
ty without diversity" as they ex it-
ed through the northwest side of 
RLMAC field. 

The mission of thi s group, 
which was created last year, goes 
beyond protesting against the 
Speaker's pre ence at graduation, 
C.A.SE core member and ethnic 
studies chair George Lipsitz said, 

"Our group was not founded 
just to protest Gingrich," Lipsitz 
said , "Our concern is decreasing

senior Karin Bondwill , who 
chose to si t with the audience 
rather than with the graduates. 
"It 's important that people are 
aware of our concerns I regarding] 
the lack of diversity," 

Roosevelt senior Yarcd 
Woudneh said he felt betrayed by 
Gingrich's presence, 

''I'm really angry," he said. 
"This is my first year here si nce [ 
transferred to UCSD. and one of 
the rcasons 1 chose UCSD is 
because Clinton spoke about 
diversity. [ thought it was a school 
that promoted diversity. Had it 
been Gingri~h that spoke I would 
not have corne here." 

Those who demonstrated 
against Gingrich and the universi-
ty were not the only people 
protesting on commencement 
day, Other community members 
who came to support Gingrich, 
carried red and blue signs which 
said "I (heart symbol) Newt" and 
"Speaker Gingrich." These pro-
testers sat with other audience 
members and rose to cheer for the 
speaker as the opposi ng protesters 
stood to turn their backs on him. ,

country is all about." said

PROUD: Graduate Souley Diallo, the exiting A.S. president, 
applauds for Gingrich (seated , right) after he finishes his speech. 

CEREMONY: 
Address foc uses on 
nonparti san issues 
Continued from page A23 
ber and Gingrich·suppurter Bruce 
Skane. Skane sat in the audience 
and held a " I (heart sign) Newt" 
sign. 

" Hopefu ll y, thi s is what [the 
graduates] have learned in sehoul. 
and they wi II practice it for the rest 
of Iheir lives," he added. 

Graduating Warren senior Tony 
Findlum also joined the counter· 
protest. 

" I'm glad about Newt Gingrich 
cornin g." he sa id. "/t 's a nicc bal· 
ance with Clinton. Gingrich is 
somebody who had done a lot for 
us. 

" He's certainly u hi storical fig-
ure, and he engineered one of the 
largest political changeovers in 
recent history," he added. "He's a 
slrong force for taxpayers and 
small·business owners, and against 
union thugs ." 

As the speaker stepped fort h to 
take the podium, the protesters 
cheers and boos greeted him. In the 
first moments of his speech. he 
acknowledged the protesters and 
gave his opinions on free ·pee~h . 

"I appreciate being on a univer· 
sity campus where the right to di s-
sent is real, and where people cun 
have different views, including, 
uccasionall y, conscrvative views," 
Gingrich said. 

") believe in free spee~h, and ) 
believe in genuine di vers it y, whieh 
inclUdes all of us, not j ust a self· 
defined group." he continued. 

Despite the political overtones 
of the protests, Gingrich's speech 
contained only a few reli.:rencl:s to 
cu rrenl political issues . 

" We wi II work very hard to con· 
tinue to balance the budget. which 
will lower interest rates on your 
student loans and wi II eost you less 
to pay them back." Gingrich sa id . 
" We will work to cut your tax es, so 
when get that joh to buy that car, to 
get that hou se, you'll actually have 
the take·home pay to do it wilh. 
and that will be part of your 
future." 

Gingrich 's speech, whi~h was 
titled " Goals for a Generati on and 
Research for the Future." primaril y 
addressed today's changing tech-
nology and the role of UCSD and 
its graduates in these changes. 

Gingrich told the graduates that 
they will be able to create a 
" remarkable future" for them 'elves 
if Ihey do three things: help to 
ensure research for new technolo-
gies, change the way the 'cicnces 
are taught in order to generate 

greater intere~t by students. and 
lea rn how to better understand th.: 
s~ icnl;cS so they are morc appli~a­
ble tu ordinary li ves. 

" I helieve that the 21s1 century 
more than the 20th century wi II be 
the ~entury of seie l1l:e, progres . and 
prosperity." he said. 

Ging rich al so reminded Ihe 
graduates of their individual roks 
in the years to come. 

"You fa~e a very ex~i ting timc, 
a time o f enormous opportunity, 
but, in the end, eaeh of you will 
face that as a person ." We could 
talk about Ameril:a, we could talk 
about California, but what it comes 
down to is ". each year is li ved one 
minute at a time by one person 
interacting with another person," 
he said. 

Gingrieh closed his speed\ by 
offering advi ~e to the graduates on 
how to gain the most from th.: 
opportunities presented to them. 

"I suggest to you that you dream 
big, that you work hard, that you 
learn daily, [and] that you enjoy 
li l'c," he said. 

'The number one differe n~.: 
between Nobel Prile winners and 
other scientists is not IQ, it 's not 
work ethic," Gingrich continued. 
"The number one difference is that 
they ask higger questions." 

After Gingrich's speech, 
Chancellor Roben Dynes conferred 
the degrees to the graduates and the 
ceremony dosed. Afterward , th.: 
spcceh and the prote~te rs drew 
mixed reactions from both gradu-
ates and audience members. 

" [The speec h 1 was good 
because of the fact that it was nOI a 
political message," said Revelle 
graduate lenni Baham. " I was more 
impressed with Chan~e llor D ynes' 
speeeh, though. He seems to care 
about the students and that was 
re llected in his speech." 

Lakshmi C hilukuri , who 
received her doctorate at the cere-
mony, disagreed. 

" [The speech) was pretty lame." 
she said. "He [Gingrich] was so 
busy trying to avuid ~ontroversy 
that he said nothing substanti al." 

One audience member cri ti cized 
the protesters for their decision to 
protest during the ceremony. 

"They [the protesters) took 
away from the ceremony. There 
should bc a place and a time for it, 
but not here." audience member AI 
Taquino said. " I ' m handieapped, 
and I have to si t in handi capped-
restri cted seating. The protesters, 
too, should be restricted to a certain 
area." 

Another graduate took an 
ambivalent view toward the pro· 
testers .

CEREMONY: 
No police, security 
intervention needed 
Continued from page A25 

"IThe protesters I were prell y 
orderl y," Roosevelt graduate 
Carlton Lear said. "They kept 
quiet , and they did a lillie chant as 
they were leaving, but they didn ' t 
disrupt the ceremony." 

" I personally didn ' t care labout 
Gingrich's presence!," he contin-
ued. "I'm not ' a protester. I'm not a 
proponent, but I do believe in free 
speech. If you don 't like him, just 
don 't vote for him ." 

According to UCSD Police 
Sergeant Jell Hutchinson, no inci-
dents that required police interven-
tion occurred during commence-
ment . 

Security wa visible around the 
event , as about 20 UC D police-
uniformed and plainclothes -
patrolled Ihe field and the nearby 
area. College deans also monitored 
the fi eld for any pulential prob-
lems. 

Slarf Pro, a private security 
company, was also on hand to 
assist the police around the lield 
and at the entrance checkpoints, 
where everyone who allended the 
ceremony was searched prior to 
entry. 

Additionally, poli ce closed 
Hopkins Drive, which is a standard 
security measure when guests such 
as Gingrich come to campu s, 

Hutchinson said. 
"C losing down Hopkin~ Dri ve 

is done a~ a part of dignitary pro-
tection," Hutchinson said. '"This is 
10 limit anything goi ng wrong." 

Overall , Hutchinson sa id that he 
and the UCSD pol ice were pleased 
with the outcome of commence-
ment. 

"We're happy with the way it 
IUrned ou t," HUlchinson said. "We 
were pleasantly surpri sed. The peo-
ple who demonstrated did so in a 
professional and mature manner. 

"AnYlime law enforcem':nl 
doesn' t have to get involved is 
good, from our standpoint ." 

Prior to Gingrich 's speec h, 
members of the UCSD and uni ver-
si ty community al so addressed the 
audience. Dynes opened the cere-
mony by expressing hope that th\! 
graduates would continue the rela-
ti onships that they estahli shed dur-
ing their time at UCSD. 

''fhe uni versity should become a 
cont inuing parl of your life," Dyn<!s 
sa id. ''Today you become alumni of 
this great uni versi ty and take on a 
new ro le in the UC D famil y." 

"Everything you do in life, 1 
hope you will not stop learning," he 
continued. "Know that the knowl-
edge and reseurces uf UCSD will 
always be there for you." 

Dynes also menti oned the issue 
of di versity and its import ance in 
today's world. 

"If you arc going to lead and he 
successful in your future endeav-
ors, you wi ll need to explore the 

Til.: UCSD Guardian 

hr.::adth of ideas and a di vasi ty of 
wlture~ . 

"With creativity, hard work and 
the strength derived from di versity, 
you can build a city, a state, a 
nation and the wo rld , hased on the 
bes t ideas and the purest vision," he 
said, in a comment that drew 
applause from the audience. 

Former A.S. Pn!sident Sou Icy 
Dia llo, who was among the mem-
bers of the 1998 graduating class, 
offered up hi s rellections for the 
graduates. 

"Today we stand at a crossroads, 
a crossroads div iding a familiar past 
from an uncertain futun:," Diallo 
~aid . "As we look to thl: past, we 
rellect upon the educational experi-
em;es both in and outside or the 
classroom which has fostered our 
intellectual development." 

Diallo a lso di 'cussed hi s 
thoughts on the gradllute\ future '. 

"As \w look to the fotu re , many 
or LI S move toward ul1l:l:rlain 
paths," he said. "Between graduate 
schuul and ihl: work force , all of u ~ 
must eva luate our place in society." 

Before c losing hi s speech and 
introducing the spea ker, Diallo 
spok.: on hi s hopes for fellow grad-
uates. 

''There arc those who .:xpect our 
generation to fail , to cower and 
hide in uncertainty under the cur-
tain of mediocrity," he said . ·T b.:

Water Polo Splits Opening Tournaments 
ENDURANCE: The Tritons open up 3-0, fall to Stanford, and then endure four grueling matches at the SoCal Invite 
By John Maynard 
Sports EdItor 

Though the best way to cnd a 
sea~on is wi th a win, vi(;tory was 
not the way Head Coach Denny 
Harper 's boys 
finished up 

dominate on Sunday like they did 
on Saturday, the boys showed their 
resilience on Sepl. 13 in their battle 
against the U. S. Air Forc.:e 
Academy. 

Though

goa l at the 
half, the 
Tritons rallied The Aggics 

from UC 
Davi s nai led 
the coffin shut for the Tritons. 
sending them packing early from 
last year's Western Water Polo 
Assoe.:iation (WWPA) Tournament. 

The nest way to redeem an 
excruciating, season-ending loss, is 
to open the neKt season with an 
authoritative victory. 

Harper's boys did just that at 
their season-opening UC San 
Diego Triton Invitati onal. 

The team opened up its 1998 
campaign on Sept. 12 against the 
University of Redlands - the 
school that hosted last year 's 
WWPA tour ney. 

The No. 10 Tritons unleashed 
early in the game, scoring seven 
unanswered lirst -half goals. 

Though the Redlands team put 
four goals in the bac k of the cage 
during the second half. this Illark 
paled in comparison to UCSD's 
seven sec.:ond-half goals. Final 
score: UCSD 14. Redlands 4. 

In game two, UCSD continued 
to ro ll . defeating the Mustangs 
from Claremont College. 

The Tri tons had no loving for 
the Mustangs. embarrassing thcm 
16-6. Gordon Beh led UCSD in 
sc.:o ring, coming through wit h four 
points for the Tri tons . Six others 
contribu ted to the cause. including 
Ryan Dandy, who scored three 
points, Justin Wylie, Doug Cole. 
Ross Mecham and Steve 
Burkhalter, who each sc.:ored twice. 
Senior Andy Si Ivestri also got 
UCSD on thl' board with one goal. 

Though the Tritons did not 

in the third 
quarter. 

uutscoring the Air Force 3- 1. 
UCSD put up another three 

points in the fourth quarter to seal 
the two-goal win. Fi nal score :

the only thing she was able to ask

(something I probably wouldn't

Both teams played well enough to 
win. but the new Triton defense of 
Harispc (a midtielder last year) , 
Emily Scheese and Liz Schilling 
eventually broke down, yielding 
two Wc~tmont goals . 

Throughout the tirst half of the 
Westmont game, they continued to 
keep the door shut. But the Triton 
offense cou ldn 't get it going as 
both teams were unable to find the 
bal,;k of the nel. 

But in the second half, 
Westmont midfielder Katie 
Gardinier made two spec tacular 
moves to get through thc Triton 
defense and finished by chipping 
Het land with a nice left -footer. For 
the lirsttime all season, UCSD was 
down. The Tritons did not rea(;t 
well. A few minutes later. an 
unmarked Gardinier was able to 
slip past the Tri ton defense to put a 
way a Warrior cornerkick. 

"We were worried about

sa id. "But .we forgot to mark the

we do have them here. My friend s 
at UCSB believed that they raged

make mistakes in and alound the 
18 [yard boxJ. bad things will hap-
pen." 

Bad things like being down 2-
O. But instead of folding, the 
Tritons regrouped. Led by the 
blazing runs up front by Dostalek. 
Abizaid and Hurley, the Tritons 
put pressure on the Warrior 
defense. Finally, Theile broke the 
ice for the Tritons with a slick left-
footer from just outside the 18-
yard box that bare I y squeaked by 
the Westmont keeper. 

The momentum then shifted 
drastically for the Tritons. They 
began to dominate the game and 
Do ·tal ek nearly tied it with a blast 
that went off the crossbar. New 
mid fielder Angie Mann had a nice 
game that was almost a great one as 
her header off a comer kick just 
missed the net. 

But the Tritons I,;ould not con· 
vert and fell to 3- 1- 1. Afterward. 
they were obviously distraught. 
The pressurc on them is tremen-
dous this year - they have some big 
shoes to till and naturally, every 
loss will be painful. But McManus 
did not appear too concerned. 
"They leamed something tonight." 
McManus said with a sly smile. 
"We will be just fine."

But the Tritons

Their shots went otT 
the post or missed 
by inches and great 

probably jealous of 
salmon. I,;onsideri ng 
that it is having 
some diflil,;ulty pulling otT the same 
task. 

Thus far. Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong 's squad has been hat-
tling not on ly its opponents. but 
itself. 

With new players. lineup 
changes and position shifts, it has 
been an unseuling beginning for 
the Tritons ' 1998 campaign. The 
changes have led to confusion and 
mental mistakes on the tleld whil,;h 
have hurt UCSD. 

In fact, the team has resembled 
a Jekyli -and-Hyde act. It opened 
the season with two convincing 
victories, then posted a draw, then 
lost two games in poor fashion. 

The season is only tive games 
old and already it 's been a roller 
coaster ride. 

Last year was a roller coaster 
ride as well , albeit not a very fun 
one. The Tri tons were up and down 
all season long, and the season wl-
minated in a heanbreaking loss to 
Claremont College in the first 
rou nd of the NCAA Division III 

saves were made by the opposing 
keeper. All it took was one cheap 
Claremont goal to send UCSD 
packing. 

It also sent Armstrong and his 
staff to work. They brought some 
new players into the fold, and 
experimented with formations and 
positions .. 

When the Tritons hit the tit;ld 
for their opening match, a home 
contest again t Kean College or 
New Jersey, the boys appeared 
ready. 

Kean was a dominant team in 
Division l/I last season. traveling 
deep into the postseason. It was 
ranked No. \J to open the season. 
and the Tritons had their work cut 
out for them. 

For Triton soccer fans. there 
were many familiar faces on the 
Ileid as returning starters Tyler 
Thompson, Robert Bessler. Brady 
Bernard . Anthony Funil,;ello, 
Cameron Adams. Lucas Curtolo 
and John Brandon were all on the 
field . Newcomers Rob Benowkz. 

Bryan ong. Daniel Appel , Bret 
Munson and Sean alinas were 
also on the pitch, ready to con· 
tribute. The blend of veterans and 
newcomers proved to bc quite tasty 
for Triton fan~ . 

Behind two wonderful guals 
from the transfer Salinas. UCSD 
stomped Kcan. 4·0. 

The Tritons were up 1-0 at the 
half behind a powerful Adams 
penalty kil,;k . but Kean wasn't play-
ing badly at all. 

In the sCl,;ond half, though. the 
Triton otTcn 'e uwoke behind the 
playmaking skills of Brandon and 
Adam~. 

Salinas opened the floodgates 
with a spectacular. swerving rope 
from outside the 18-yard box, and 
from there the Tritons baltered their 
helpless counterparts from the 
Garden State. 

Against Southern Ca lifornia 
College. the Tritons were down 1-0 
all game until Salinas rung the bell 
again. sl.:Uring in the 84th minute to 
send the matd! into overtime. In 
the sel.:Ond overtime period. Joshua 
Davis, another lIewcomer. ended 
the marathon match with a nice 
vo lley. 

The Tritons opened up 2-0 and 
showed allacking punch. tough 
defense and trcmendous heart. So 
for an encore. the Tritons drew with 
a so lid Master's College squad in a 
very ordinary effort. A more m:ga-
uve tone was set. 

The next match for UCSD was a 
tough one. Azusa Pacific 

Usa Huff/GuardIan 
USED: Star Triton midfielder Cameron Adams puts a move on an 
Azuza P~cific defender last week. but the Tritons fell, 5·1. 
University is a powerful NAIA 
team with scholarship players, a 
luxury UCSD cannot afford . The 
game was an absolute disaster. The 
Tritons were unorganized and 
made mistakes. 

Bad traps and weak dearanl,;cs 
led to II ve goa ls for Azusa in as- I 
rout. It was just ugly. All tive goa ls 
were not as a result of Asuza's ae-
ativity, but rather because of Triton 
incptitude. 

Last Friday. the Tritons looked 
to redeem themselves against a 
beatable Biola College team. They 

did not find what they were looking 
for. For the first lime all season. the 
Tritons were shutout and suffered a 
tough, 1-0 loss at the hands cif 
Biola. 

"It was just bad." Adams said. 
"We were bad." 

The new-look Tritons are noth-
ing if not interesting. They have 
looked like world-beaters one 
moment and thc Bad News Bears

Confident Cross Country Starts Out Strong 
AMBITIOUS: The Tritons opened up their season with both the men's and women's squads gaining victories in against Point Lorna 
By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

Of all the places to go in this 
beautiful country. the UCSD cross 
country squad has its heart set on 
the most wonderful pl. ace of all: 
Carlisle, Pennsylvania. 

That's right, you read correctly. 
Who needs the sunny beaches of 
Florida" New York is overrated, 
New Orleans'! Hey, the party can 
wait. 

It 's all about Carlisle, the site of 
thi s season's NCAA Division III 
National Championship. 

Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
and company should be wary of 
such a dream; it just might come 
true. 

Last year's site for the National 
Championship was Boston, Mass., 
and the men made their desi re to 
get there a reality. This Beantown 
dream did not have a happy ending 
however, as the Tritons trudged 
th rough the mud to a sloppy 16th-
place finish . 

The women's squall onl y sent 
one member, Amy Kitchen, but the 
conditions and competition were 
too much for her and she did not 
place, 

Nevert heless. when the Tritons 
began training for the upcoming 
cason. their goa l remained the 

same. 

In fact. last season's result prob-
ably reinforced their ambition to 
get back to Nationals, 

Both the men's and women'~ 
teams enter the 1998 campaign 

with new looks, as some key mem-
bers from last year have depaned. 
Gone from the men' squad are 
superstars Gavin Klinger and Neal 
Harder, and with them seniors 

Steve Varnell and Mike Wallace. 
Returning from last year's 

National squad are James ielsen, 
Franzwa Achie and Kevin 
Prindi vi lle. All three are strong run-
ners and will receive support this 
season from some of the team 's 
veterans. 

Damian Garcia, Nate Garcia, 
Mike Wangler, Rory Clarke and 
Steve Walsh are all expected to step 
up this year and score some points. 
Also. freshmen Dave Dunbar and 
Steve Manin are expected to I:On-
tribute. 

Kitchen, the only Triton female 
to reach the ationals last year ha~ 
departed. She left beh ind a talented 
team. 

Meghan ScOIl performed well 
last season and wi ll he a star this 
year. Joining her in the spotligh t 
wi ll be Maggie Dwire, a Na ti ona l 
Finalist two seasons ago, and Li~a 
Klinger. 

Though the Triton ' entered the 
season wi th some question marks 
because of the new faces. they 
exhibit ed ~urpris ing confidence. 

Their first home meet of the sea-

• I Tos 
Bun 

son, an officia l tune-up against the 
Cru saders of Point Loma azarene 
Uni ver ity. was a success as both 
teams ran wild in an impressive 
dual victory. 

That victory fueled the compet-
itive names for UCSD. Van 
Arsdale's troops were fired up for 
the first big meet of the season, the 
San Diego State Aztec Invitational 
last Saturday. 

Just check the guest Ii t to 
judge the importance of the event. 
The Uni versi ty of Arizona, the 
Universi ty of Arkansas. UCLA , 
USC and Long Beach State 
Unive rsity, among other sch ols, 
attended the meet. 

Both the mcn and the women 
ran well in this very competiti ve 
race. Matches like that force every-
one on the team to step it up. 
Seconds mean the d i ITerence 
between medaling and going home 
with nothing . 

The men had a so lid day, but 
they needed to be spectacular. 
Nielsen led the way far thl: Tritons, 
linishing in 17th place, a nice Iln-
i~h . 

The nextllnisher for UCSD was

decent races. 

UCSD linished seventh in the

Linda Monroe and Lisa Klinger 
al~o had good races . but it wasn't

The year 's Tritons are a young

the Tritons re main conlldent about 
their upcoming meets.

And the top story is: 
I) Can the UCSD women's soc-

Champions'! 

Last year at this time. Head 
Coach Brian McManus and compa-
ny were in this same spotlight , but 
the question was different. It was: 
Will they win'! 

Properly interpreted, last year's 
squad was expected to win. It was 
loaded with experienced tal ent. 
including All-Ameri cans Lauren 
Johnson and Beth Freeberg. The 
team also saw the return of seven 
additional seniors: Brenna Cox, 
Kate Larsen, Maricela Ociguera. 
Lisa Wilkinson, Jodie KnOll , Toni 

unez and Alison Hurley. This 
team had already experienced two 

ational Championship runs and it 
knew what it took to win. 

And win it did . The ladies 
stormed through the regular season

vs. 

to Di vis ion 11. It 
is one of the most, if not the most, 
hi storic team in UCSD history, 

But now the new question 
remains: Is this legend still a work 
in progress'! Can McManus lead 
his troops to the promised land for 
the fourth consecutive season" 
Indeed. it is a breathtaking proposi-
tion. The question is different this 
season because the team is very 
unfamiliar to most Triton fans. Last 
season it was expected. This year it 
is more of a mystery. 

There are nine freshmen on the 
team. Only two players. Hurley and 
midfielder Shelbi Theile. remain 
from the squad that won the first in 
the string of three championship 
trophi es. That is a tremendous 
player turnover. Nevertheless, the 
tal ent remaining from last year is 
outstanding. 

Among the returning sta rters 
are: Jennifer Hetland, a marvelous 
goalkeeper: Janine Harispe. an AII -

Hurley, the hard-nosed veteran. 
Yasmin Suarez was another return-
ing staner. but she sustai ned a knee 
injury and is ou t indefinitely. 

Obviously, the talent is there. 
Will the remaining pieces fall into 
place" 

After the first ga me of the sea-
.on , it didn't look good. The 
Tri ton, looked unorgunized and 
ncrvous in a score less tie against 

Southern Cal College. a team the 
Tritons rolled last ycar. . 

But before the whi spers of 
impending doom could even begin, 
UCSD reeled off a three-game win 
streak with convincing victories 
over St. Thomas of Minnesota (1-
0), Claremont College (3-0). and 
Pomona-Pitzer (4-0) . McManus 
had hi s troops looking like the

skipping a beat wi th the polb.ters , 

either. as the Tritons were ranked 
o. 2 in the latest Division III 

women's soccer poll . 
But thi s squad is di fferent from 

its predecessors. It is young. and 
will not be able to wi ll itself to vic-

It wi ll have to learn its lessons . And

Athletic Department Shuffles Its Deck 
TURNOVER: Director of Athletics, Judy Sweet, was busy this summer overseeing head coaching and administrative changes 
By John Maynard 
Sports fnitor 

While the majority of the Triton 
population spent the summer 
working, interning or ju~t keeping 
current with Jerry Springer , the 
offices at the athletic department 
were busy searching for new 
department personal. 

UCSD director of athletics 
Judy Sweet was csp\!c ially busy a~ 
she took on the task of linding a 
pair of new head coache~. 

Though the search was long, 
Sweet announced on Aug. 27 the 
hiring of head coaches for the 
men's volleyball and men 's and 
women 's swimming and diving 
tcams. 

Jon Stevenson, widely recog-
nized in volleyball circles for his 
long-time involvemcnl with beach 
volleyball and with thc Assoc iation 
of Volleyball Profe~sional s (AVP), 
was named to take over the Triton 
men's volleyball program. 

SCOIl McGihon , the former 
Long Beach State Club coach and 
current assistant swim coach at the 
University of Iowa, was sclected as 
head coach for the UCSD men's 
and women 's swimming and diving 
teams. 

Stevenson 's involvement with 
the AVP dates back to 19114 , when 
he helpcd found the organi7ati on. 

Stevenson served a~ executive 
player representati ve. senior man-
ager and a mcmber of the AVP 
Board of Directors. During hi s 
tenure. he was also a highly regard-
ed player and coach. 

Upon retiring as a player, he 
was hired as the senior vice presi-
dent of tour admini stration and 
president of AVP properties. 

A Manhattan Beach nati ve . 
Stevenson attended Brigham 
Young University. where he made 
the basketball team as a walk-on . 
He later transferred to UC anta

cessful volleyball career as a mcm-

in the Directors' up ~tandings. But to 
be the oo,t ovcmll program. winning 
two ati nal Championships is not. 
always enough. 

U SD responded to the chal-
lengc of winter qu,lrter by posting 
strong resu It s from t he men's and 
women 's swimming and diving 
teams. 

Men 's swimming and diving

admirably. contributing another 60 
points to the cause with it s third-

On thc AVP Tour, Stevenson 

was the 1984 Grand Prix 
Champion, the 1984 AVP 
Sportsman of the Year and the AVP 
Defensive Player of the Year in 
1988 and 1989. 

Stevenson ranks 11th all-time in 
AVP caree r tournament victories, 
and has been inducted into both the 
Californ ia Beach Volleyball Hall of 
Fame and the Profess ional Beach 
Volleyball Hall of Fame. 

Stevenson wi ll rep lace Triton 
head coach Duncan McFarland. 
who stepped down from the men's 
program in order to devote all hi s 
time to UCSO's women 's volley-
ball team and i lS quest to repeat as 

atioml l Champions. 
McGihon, the new 'men 's and 

women's swimming and diving 
hcad coach. graduated from UC 
Irvine in 1990 where he competed 
on the Anteaters' swi m team. 
McG ihon began his coachi ng 
career as the va rsity girls' swim 
wach at Newport Harbor High 
School in Newport Beach. 

In 1994, McGihon took over the 
Long Beach State Swim Club. and 
foundcd the Beach Swim Club in 
Long Beach the following year. 

In 1996, he accepted a position 
as head as~istant coach and recrui t-
ing coordinator at the ni ver~i t } of 
Utah, before moving on to the 
University of Iowa in 1997. 

Under h i~ direction. the 
Hawkeyes Ii nbhed the 1997 dual 
meet season wi th a n:cord of 6-4, 
their best l'inish ever. 

McGihun succceds Doug Boyd. 
who recentl y resigned to take over 
head coaching respons ibiliti e~ at 
Rice University in Texas. 

In other coaching new~. UCSD 
interim baseball coach, Dan 
O' Brien. was named. head coach 
for the Tritons.

former star for the Tritons, lead

Women's Volleyball Opens Up With Authority 
FEASTING: It's open season for McFarland's voUeyball squad, as the ladies (9- l) have dropped only three games thus far 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

By winning their first NCAA 
National Championships since 
1991 , the UCSD women 's volley-
ball team added 100 points last year 
to UCSD's Sears Cup tally. 111ese 
championship points proved crucial, 
as the Tritons barely beat out run-
ner-up Conland State (NY) by 30 
points. 

If UCSD plans to keep its reigl) 
as Ihe "Champion uf Champion~" 
in Division III , it will rely heavil y 
on the success of Ihis year's squad. 

Judging from the lea rn 's perfor-
mance so far, a ba<.:k-to-back cham-
pionship i ~ poss ible. 

So far. the women have been 
solid this year, dropping only one 
or Iheir first 10 malches. Even 
more impressive than their 9-1 
record is the fact that all of their 
victories have been sweeps. The 
Trilons have only lost three games 
all season - all of which came in 
their loss to California Siale 
Hayward earlier this month. 

Though hi s Tritons have been 
very successful thus far Ihi s season, 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland 
remains humble about hi s squad. 

"We are looking good." said 
McFarland after the Tritons victory 
over Rochester In~litute of 
Tedlllology. "But we are nowhere 
where we could be. It \ still ea rly in 
Ihe season." 

A big reason the women aren' t 
where they could be is due to the 
loss o r All -Ameri can sellcr. 

Sherine Ebadi. However, it isn 't as 
bad as it sounds. Though Ebadi 
graduated la t June, she remains 
with the Tritons as an assistant to 
McFarland. 

" It must be tough for I Ebadi} to 

I5N" •• iVOLLEYBALL 

be on the sideline and off of thl! 
coun." McFarland said. " But we 
are very glad to have her around. 
She's a great seller coach." 

This weekend, the coaching duo 
of Ebadi and McFarland must have 
done something ri ght as the Trilons 
put toge ther two conv.incing road 
vict ri es . 

"[ am much more confident 
about our team after thi s weekend." 
McFarland sa id. 

On Friday, the Tritons traveled 
to CSU Hayward , seeking revenge 
for their previous upset. 
McFarland 's women deli ve red. 

When UCSD last met Ihe 
Pioneers. it was a grueling three-
hour endeavor that ended in a sour-
ing disappointment. 

That di sappointmenl fueled Ihe 
nre for lasl Friday 's rematch. 

"We played a very solid game 
[on Friday], and never let up:' 
~e nior middle hlocker Shannon 

oonan said. "We were really fired 
up. We lost to I Haywa rd I two 
weeks ago in game live of the 
Whittier Co ll ege Tournament. hut 

we knew we could beat them this 
time." 

The girls came in with authority 
and won in straight games (15-9), 
( 15-8) and ( 15-6). 

Though it was a cooperative 
eff rt , Noonan, who had 12 kills, 
noted the exce llence of freshman 
middle blocker, Kathl een Hentz, 
who had 10 kills, and the hustle of 
senior setter Dana Salter. 

"Kalhleen stepped up," Noonan 
·aid . "and Dana was everywhere." 

McFarland abo ~he ll ed out the 
acco lades. 

" Back-court spec iali sl Jai me 
Hackleman was key to our win in 
game three," M\;F:u l:lIld ~:!id . "She 
had scven points, including two 
serv icc aces." 

On Salurday, Ihe gi rls drove 
over Ihe hill on Highway 17, to 
meet up with the fer cious Banana 
Slugs of U Santa Cru z. 

In the ~ame fashion as Friday's 
game. Ihe Tritons dom inaled Slugs , 
wi nning in straight games (15-3), 
( 15-11 ) and ( I 5-6). 

"I dietn ' t remember Sanla Cruz 
being st rong, but tht! were," 
Noonan said . "We came in sirong 
in ga me one. bare ly won the second 
[gamel, and duminalcd tht! third." 

Junior out ~ide hilter Allison 
Bender had an oUl standing game, 
leading the Tritons in kills. 

Bender had a ste llar weekend . 
including 17 kilb. and was quick to 
dish ou t the cOlll p limc nt ~ . 

"We played II gi rb and all of 
Ihem played well ," Bender said . 

Usa Huff/ Guardian 
KILLER: Freshman outside hitter Kearney Visser whacks another 
kill over the Tiger blockers of Rochester Institute of Technology. 

"Eve rybody stepped up and played 
logether." 

If the Trilons aren ' t, as 
McFarland said. "where [theYI 
wu ld b.: ," then the rest of Di vision 
III had beller walch out. 

Hayward. previously in 

Divi sion II , was ~upposed to be 
UCSD's strongest ronference con-
lention. If Friday 's result is a sign 
of what's to come, expect to be lill-
ing up the seals at RIMAC co me 
December.

It's Bigger Than 
You've Heard 

This is the fifth time I' ve 
started over on thi wlumn. All 
I rea lly want to say is that you 
all should be stoked 10 be here. 
Let me explain : 

When I lirst got to UCSD, 
most of the people I mel had 
ambivalent attitudes about 
being here. They were excited 
to be at college, but only 
because it was a coll ege and it 
was away from hume - not 
be(; au se they were going to 
UCSD. 

Everyone I met. wedged 
UCSD between Berkeley and 
UC Santa Barbara. The people 
who came to UCSD were Ihe 
ones who didn ' t get into 
Berkeley, but were over UCSB. 
UCSD was the bastard middle 
child, the one Ihat ended up 
institulionali zed and living orf 
Prozac. Nobody wanted it 
around. 

I felt the same way. 
I was so bummed that I 

wasn' t at some big Division [ 
school that embodied eve ry -
thing college was supposed to 
be- big games, big panics, big 
cheechies. (Things supposedly 
unavailable at UCSD) 

I was wrong. Hell, I was an 
athhole. When I was a fresh -
man, I barely knew whal 
ambivalent meant. -

Whal I I hought I wanted was 
exactly what would have ruined 
me. Had I gone to one of those 
Division I Greek schools. I'd 
probably be fat , single and stu-
pid hy now. Basically, I would 
have gOllen no lovin '. 

That's what 's so great aboul 
UCSD. It is just chill here. 
Everyone is basica lly who they 
seem to be. One of my seven 
roommates gets pi ssed anti 
complains that UCSD gi rl s 
don ' l dress like State girls; that 
they wear 50 I s instead of hot 
pants. (He has al 0 said that 
"Nine oul or ten girls are hot. 
The olher one goes to UCSD.") 
Their sense or fashi on docs take 
some gelling used 10, however, 
it is worth the wait. Talking to a 
girl beats the hell out of just 
looking at ber.

UCSD is recognized for the 
most outstanding Division 
III sports program in NCAA 

By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

It 's nOI your mom's candy dish. 
The Sears Directors' Cup, a $35.oo0 Waterford Crystal lrophy current-

ly ~howcased in Ihe bookstore window, is the resull of UCSD's brilliant 
alhlclic prowc~s last ~.:a~o n . 

Though UCSD is nol a Di vision I powerhouse, it has always been a 
sirong co'ntendl:r in Division III play. 

Preparations have begun fur UCSD's jump up to Division II, a move 
Ihat will he ce lebraled in the year 20oo. For now, UCSD will lay 

claim to Ihe litle of "the best uverall athletics progr.un in the 
NCAA Division III ." 

For several years, Ihe Sears Direclors ' Cup, administered 
by Ihe alional Association of Collegiate Directors of 

Athletics ( ACDA). has been awarded to the Division I 
school wilh the top combined men and women's athlet-

i\;s program. NACDA implemented Division III. 
Di vision II and National Association of 

Interco ll egiale Athletics (NAIA) recognition 
three years ago. 

Since the Division 1II and NAIA imple-
menlalion, UCSD has always been a lOp 
contender. The Tritons were runner-ups 
to the Cup in 1996, and finished in 
Ihird place in 1997. Lasl June was Ihe 

firsl time UC D accepted thc 
Direclors ' Cup. 

In the Di vision III category, 
each sc hool submits a tOlal of I K 
team res ults, nine entries each 
frollltbe men's and women's pro-
grams. For each of the sports, a 
point system based on post-sea-
son competilion is used to rank 

teams on a scale of 10 to I oo 
points. 

UCSD compiled 490 
points, edging out onland 

State (NY) and the Co llege 01' 
New Jersey who tied for ~c<.:ond 

place with 460 points. Middlebury 
(V·T) tied defending champion 

Williams (MA) wilh 430 points for 
founh place. 

A large chunk of UCSD's 490 points 
(;ame from the success of its women's ath-

letic program. UCSD acquired 2oo poinls 
from its two National Championships in 
soccer and volleyba ll. 

For its third National Title in a row, 
women's soccer added I oo points to the 

tally. Under Head Coach Duncan McFarland, 
the 1997 women 's volleyball team also added 100 

points to the lotal as the women won their first tit le

Legendary gothic band casts its spell on a 
dedicated audience 

By Amy Ayers 
Guardian Reporter 

Passers- by of downtown San 
Diego's Golden Hall The-ater on the 
night of Aug. 10 might j1ave won-
dered would event c.:ould possibly 
have attracted the blac k-clad , 
white- faced crowd of thousands. 
Was it Marilyn Manson's funerar! 
A not-so-secret meeting of the lat-
est cult? San Diego's first annual 
mime convention? 

Nothing other than the return of 
goth legends, BauHaus, could have 
brought together such a crowd. 

After breaking up during the 
1980s, the grandfathers of gOlh 
reunited to pl ay their !irs!. and hope-
full y not last, reunion tour. Tickets to 
Bauhaus shows scheduled in Los 
Angeles and San Diego sold out in 
minutes, even priced at $33 a piece. 

The band emerged in 1979, with 
its performance of "Bela Lugosi's 
Dead" in the cult vampire tilm 
"The Hunger: ' It reached the height 
of its popularity by the early 19805, 
before breaking up a few years 
later. However, the an Diego 
show proved that Bauhaus could 
still cast thei r magic spell over an 
audience almost 20 years later. 

The atmosphere of the crowd 
could bes t be described as expec-
tant. Although many vete ran 
Bauhaus fans attended. the majori-
ty of younger fa ns had never before 
experi enced the pleasure of a li ve 
Bauh aus concert. The rec.:e nt 
release of a new Bauhaus compila-
tion album further increased the 
crowd's anticipation. Although the 
album consists mostl y of favorites, 
which can be found on older. com-
monplace Bauhaus albums. a lis-
tener can find a few rarit ies. 

As the li ghts went out and the 
first strains of mu 'ic began , 
Bauhaus worshippers grew impa-
tient. Finally, three of the band 
members appeared: Dani el Ash 
ta lso or Love and Rockets) on lead 
guitar, David J. on bass, and Kevin 
Haskins on drums.

place. goth idol Peter Murphy (lead 
voca ls) was nowhere to be seen. 
Instead, as the band began it ' s 
opening song, "Dark Entries," 
Murphy's face was projected in 
blue on the monitor. Thus began an 
evening of pure enchantmenl. 

Against a backdrop of the infa-
mous Bauhaus face logo, Murphy 
joined the rest of his band to com-
mence the seduction of their 
legions. With a Bowie-like allure, 
40-something Murphy still po '-
sessed the charms to make every 
daughter of darkness in attendance 
wish she had special passes into his 
holiness's dressing room. 

The singer danced provocative-
Jy through renditions of favorites 
like ''The Pas 'ion of Lovers," "Ter-
ror Couple Kill Colonel," "A Spy 
in the Cab" and "She's in Parties:' 
Murphy changed outfit s ' and 
applied makeup during other songs 
includ ing "God in an Alcove," 
"Double Dare," "In the Flat Field" 
and "Ziggy Stardust" - a tri bute to 
Dav id Bowie. 

Thanks to exceptional sound, 
each song came out clear, recogniz.-
able and nothing less than bewitch-

ing. During "Hollow Hills," a high-
light of the show, li ght bulbs hang-
ing from c.:ords were lighted one at 
a time as Mu rphy walked under 
them, enhancing the song's eerie 
qual ity and li lling the crowd with 
the awe thi s performance deserved. 

If any band could give gothic 
music a sense of humor. Bauhaus

B4 WELCOME WEEK SECfION 

By Melody Gonzales 
Guardian Reporter 

Just 30 miles south of UCSD 
lies the U.S.-Mexico border. and 
just beyond that - the great fresh-
men temptation - Tijuana. l:haral:-
terized by a low drinking age. 
cheap a((;ohol. crowded dubs and 
blaring beats of wild music. 

The seven-block stretch of 
Avenida Revolul:i6n is particularly 
enticing to San Diego students who 
are 18 to 20 years old and cannot 
legally buy or wnsume alcohol in 
the United Stutes. For under $20, 
almost anyone can take advantage 
of the clubs' "All You Can Drink" 
specials. tear up the dance floor 
beneath the catwalk. and then head 
back to America in a cheap Mexi -
can cab. 

Many UCSD freshmen. in 
search of that crazy college experi -
ence. have been know 10 make the 
TJ trek on an almost weekly basis. 
However, the streets down south 
are a lillie different than those in La 
Jolla - with every mixed drink. 
Tijuana serves up a number of dan-
gers conc.:ealed by the neon lights 
of the clubs and the pumping beat 
of the music. 

The San Diego Po lice Depart-
ment 's Border Crime lnterventior 
Unit (BCIU) handles any prob-
lems occurnng on the U.S. side of 
the border. Officers deal with 
issues associated with Tijuana 
clubbing on a constanl basis dur -
ing their shifts. One significant 
problem the unit musl deal with 
wnstantly is the fact Ihat Ameri -
can citizens do not have the same 
rights in Mexiw as they do in the 
United States. 

For example. anyone found 
drunk in public or driving while 
intoxicated can be arn:sted by the 
Mexican police and taken to jail. 
Arresled indi viduals must pay cash 
for bailor stay in jail for at \cast 72 
hours until their coun date . In Mex-
ico, individuals accused of a crime 
are guilty until proven innocent. 

Oflicer Martin Castro. a mem-
ber of the BCIU. says an average of 

12 people each weekend report 
run-ins with the Mexican authori-
ties to the BCIU. often confronta-
tions which ended with the Ameri-
cans bribing the Mexican police to 
avoid jai I time. 

In addition, at least three to four 
people report bei ng robbed to the 
BCIU each weekend in Mexico. 
Castro estimates that the number of 
robberies which are actually report-
ed is i nsigni licant when compared 
to the number which go unreport ed. 

The fundamental problem. how-
ever, is that if something happens 
10 students in Mexico. U.S . offi-
cials cannot do anything. If an indi -
vidual 's wallet is stolen as he is 
coming back across the border, the 
crime must be reponed 10 Mexican 
police. The San Diego Police 
Depart ment cannot provide stu -
dents with assistance because the 
crime occurred within a different 
jurisdiction. As long as the crime 
occurred in Mexico, the laws of the 
Mexican judicial system prevai l, 
despite the fact that the victi m is a 
U.S. ci ti zen. 

Minors under the age of 18 arc 
not allowcd to exi t Ihe Unitcd 
States unlcss they arc accompanied 
by or have a notarized letter signed 
by a parent or legal guardian. 
Additionally. although it is legal 
for I H-year-o lds to drink in Mexi-
co. it is illegal ror anyone under the 
age of 21 to have any alcohol in 
Iheir syslem. For Ihose 21 or older, 
a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 
pen:ent or higher is considered 
lega lly drunk. 

From rapes and robberies. to 
assault and theft . violence is anot h-
er major issue for students to be 
aware of when traveling to n . 
Oflicer Cast;o classilic~ Ihe young 
people who frequent the TJ clubs as 
helonging to three primary group~: 
cullege ~tudents, mi litary personnel 
and gang members. Problems arise 
when members of the differen t 
groups become intoxicated and arc 
more prone to fight s.

By Genevieve Cox 
Senior Staff Writer 

The beginning of the school 
year often provokes one of two 
general emotions in returning stu-
dents. For those who had a lousy 
summer. it is justiliable that they 
are stoked to return to the exciting 
world of UCSD. . 

On the other hand. students who 
opted to take summer school, and 
haven' t had much of a break - or 
the more fortunate who spent the 
summer carefree, tanning them-
selves on the beaches of Waikiki -
well , they are probably dreading a 
return to the rigorous grind of the 
quarter system. 

No matter how students feel 
about starting up the school year, 
the odds are that their focus is 
going to be in places other than the 
classroom for most of fall quarter. 
[n just three short weeks, profes-
sors will think its time for 
midterms, but most students still 
won ' t have made it to the bookstore 
to drop a few hundred on this quar-
ter's textbooks - let alone actually 
started to read them. 

It doesn't mailer whether stu-
dents choose to camp OUI in Geisel 
after the first day of class. or if they 
are unable to summon the strength 
to study the night before the first 
O-Chem midterm. Never fear. 
O.A.S.l.S., the academic support 
service on ~ampus, is here! 

The O.A.S.l .S. offices are local-
ed m the middle of campus. on the 

third !loor of Center Hall. 
No matter what difficulties a 

student may have. he can take some 
small com fan in knowing that odds 
are. O.A.S.I.S. offers a program to 
help. 

For first-year students, 
O.A.S.I.S. designed the Academic 
Transition Program. which matches 
new students with peer counselors 
who can assist their academic and 
social transition from high school 
to UCSD. 

O.A.S.I.S. ·s peer mentors often 
serve as leaders of student organi-
zations, or have made a positive 
impact on the UCSD community. 
They are fully capable of offering a 
variety of advice to freshmen feel-
ing a little overwhelmed. 

For those seeking acad-
emic assistance, O.A.S.LS . 
provides help rooms, study 
tables and organized work-
shops for students strug-
gling with writ-
ing. math. sc i-
ence or foreign

The killer women from Chicago make their 
way from B roadway to San Diego 

By Melody Gonzales 
Guardian Reporter 

Long before the Spice Girls. the 
ultimate di play of girl power came 
from the 1920s women of Murder-
esses' Row. Through their deeds. or 
rather thei r misdeeds, these women 
proved to be far more than tcreo-
typical frail, reminine creatures. 
Based on the rea l- life trials of 
Belva Gaertner and Beulah Annan, 
"Chicago" is the story of women 
doing time for murdering their hus-
bands and lovers. The characters in 
the musical argue, " It was a murder 
hut not a crime." 

The musical's lead character . 
Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart , por-
tray the real 1920s murderesses. 
Gaertner and Annan. Gaertner. a 
married cabaret singer, stood trial 
for murdering her hushand in 
Chicago. hortly aftcr, Annan was 
convicted of killing her lover. 

The murder trials became hot 
press items of the time. and the 
press coverage tran 'formed the 
women from criminals to celebri-
ties. 

As a writer for the Chicago Tri· 
bUlle, Maurine Dallas Watkins took 
part in the media frenzy when she 
covered the real trials of Gaertner 
and Annan. A rew ycars after the 
trials, in 1926, she wrote a play 
based on the women 's stories, that 
Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse used i.n 
creating the award-winning block-
buster, ·'Chicago." 

The mere mention of the word 

As twisted as this 
show may seem, Its 
basis In real events 
makes "Chicago" a 
fun diversion from 
the stereotypical 
musical scenario of 
boy meets and falls 
in love with girl. The 
only type of falling 
seen in this show 
are the faUs of 
husbands or lovers 
as they are killed by 
their assertive 
female companions. 

"musical" might make some people 
groan with the thought of a cheesy, 
romantic love story. "Chicago" is 
not a typical musical. Audience 
members won't find any heart 
warming moments in this show. 
Instead, they are forewarned that 
they "are about to see a story of 
murder, greed, corruption. vio-
lence. exploitati on. adultery. and 
Ireachcry .. . all of the things we 
hold near and dear to our hearts." 
The audience is then treated to 
jazzy vocals and music. sexy "Bob 
Fossen-style dance numbers and a 
rew sli ghtly vul ga r (but funny) 

lines. 
Unlike other shows. the orches-

tra or "Chicago" takes a more 
active role from its position on 
stage. Beller yet, the show really 
doesn't contain any good guys, 
her es or sickeningly sweet churac-
ters. 

From the mOlllent the cast first 
appears on stage. everyone is 
dressed to kill .. . or be killed. With 
costumes created from a variety of 
tight black me!>h, spandex and chic , 
slinky attire, the performers present 
an entertaini ng cabaret of song, 
dance. murder and mayhem. 

One of the most entertaining 
songs in the !>hnw uses fairly sim-
ple choreography and staging. lit-
tle movcment is needed in 'The 

ell Block Tango" to draw atten-
tion 10 the lyric!>, which explain 
why the various women murdered 
their lovers, lovcd ones and hus-
band!>. 

According to the song, one hus-
band popped hi s gum, even after 
his wife told him to stop. She fired 
two warning shots .. . into hi s head. 
Another man got into an argument 
with hi s wife while she was carv ing 
turkey. He ended up "running" into 
her carving knife ... ~ix times. 

Vaudeville star Velma Kelly 
performed with her ister, doing 20 
acrobatic tricks in a row. One day 
Velma went to the store and came 
back to find her husband and sister

The Mask of Zorro 
**** SbrrinC: Antonio Banderas. Anthony 
Hopkins, Catherine Zeta·Jones 
Director: Martin Campbell 

By Julia Kull.Mader 
Senior Staff Writer 

Exploding cities. Falling aster-
oids. Massive carnage. 

Unlike other summer fare, "The 
Mask of Zorro" contains none of 
these effects. Instead, the movie is 
full of spectacul ar fencing and 
willy one- liners. 

"The Mask of Zorro" depicts 
the early bailie ror California 
between the paniards, the DOllS 
and the Mexicans. Zarro is a myth-
ic fi gure who fights against all

The story begins as Don Diego

scenes, Hopkins successfully con-
veys to the audience that Zorro is 
everything anyone could ever want 
in a hero. He is trong, caring and 
Illost importantly, smart. In addi-
tion, Hopkins also succeeds at his 
most diflicult task - convincing 
the audience that he is young. 

The lihn picks up 20 years later 
when de la Vega must find a suc-
cessor to help him battle hi s mortal 
enemy, Don Rafael Montero (Stu-
art Wilson). the former Spanish 
Governor of Alia California. Luck-
ily. de In Vega encounters Alejan-
dro Murieta (Antonio Banderas) 
who, as a boy, helped him emerge 
victorious from a bailie. 

Murieta is a compelling charac-
ter for a number of reasons. First of 
all. Banderas is an extremely 
charismatic, handsome actor. The 
audience can' t help but root for 
him. Secondly, the pairing of de la 
Vega and Murieta makes both char-
acters, especially Murieta, more 
interesting. Mur.ieta is the very per-
sonilication of the Mexican people

Antonio Banderas steals hearts in the 
summer release) 'The Mask of Zarro ' 

for whom de In Vega, the old Zorro, 
spent his early life fighting . 

Allhough both Hopkins and 
Banderas are excellent. Catherine 
Zeta-Jones, who portrays Elena, de 
la Vega's daughter and Murieta 's 
love interest. steals the show. Zetu-
Jones. 1I relati ve n()WCOmer, caught 
the eye of the producers of "The 
Mask of Zorro" in the 1996 TV 
mini -series ''Titanic.'' 

Elena is a more interesting 
female love interest than in most 
summer movies. In fact, her char-
acter cries out to be more than just 
the movie's token woman. It's safe 
to say that Elena's fencing scenes 
are by fur the most fun and exci ting 
in the film. Like Banderas. Zeta-
Jones exudes beauty and charisma. 
Maybe the two of them should 
become politicians when their act-
ing days are over. 

As good as the acting is, the real 
star of "The Ma k of Zorro" is 
well -choreographed swordplay. 
The fencing was choreographed by 
rna ter swordsman Bob Anders n.

A summer abroad provides a 
way to study the classics, 

English style 

very summer since I began col-
lege, my parenls have given me 
the option of gelling a job or 
allending summer school. With the 
exception of one fun-filled sum-
mer working in a palatial Block-
buster in Los Angeles, I usually 

chose the latter. 
This pasl summer, however, my parents 

put a lillie twist on the old summer school 
routine by sending me on a UCLA program 
to study Shakespeare in England. Since I can 
count on. one hand the places I have been 
outside of California, with the only foreign 
place being Tijuana, I was ecstatic. Only 
afler leaving America (if only for a summer) 
did 1 reali ze how glad I am to be a ci tizen of 
this country. 

Seventy-nine other UC students and I 
stayed in a hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon, 
Shakespeare's birthplace, about two hours 
north of London. Two UCLA professors led 
us through an in-depth study - both literally 
and dramatically - of seven Shakespearean 
plays. 

We alsu had the opportunity to see most of 
the plays performed by the world-famous 
Royal Shakespeare Company, which boasts 
former members such as Patrick Stewart and 
Ralph Fiennes. 

We read an average of one play 'every two 
weekdays over a four-week period. With two 
Iinals and three papers. it made for a very rig-
orous 8-unit course, and was a lot mure diffi -
cult than I expected. By the time I came 
home, I was spout ing Shakespeare to peop le 
on the street. 

The weekends were deemed "free." allow-
ing us to travel around GreaL Britain. I visited 
Oxford. Bath. London and also spent a week-
end in Dublin. Ireland . I also randumly saw 
Newt Gingrich in a cil thedral in a small Iri sh 
tuwn \:alled Kilkenny. As a "South Park" fan, 
how could I resist visiting a town wi th a name 
like that 'l I saw more cathedrals and pi\:-
turesquc castles than I can n:me,mbcr, and 
enough histuri\: sites to fill up several rolls of 
Ii I1n. 

Some of the more interesting things I saw 
were the Roman baths, where the Romans 
bathed together (bringing with it ilnages of a 
13th-century orgy); a huge four-room London 

y Eve Se 

club called the Ministry of Sound (a dan\:ing 
fashion show set to techno); and most impor-
tantly, Sl. James Gate - the Guinness Brew-
ery in Dublin, where the pungent smell of 
hops abounds. 

So, what about the people? Well , British 
people are superficially polite, but just to 
cover up a lot of rude attitudes. For example, 
I stood on a street for a couple of minutes just 
to see how many people would slam into me. 
1 fe lt li ke I was in The Verve's "Biuerswect 
Symphony" video. Try I O-plus people with 
barely a "sorry" thrown my way. 

By the way, if the British are so proper and 
polite, why do they call rcstrooms "toi lets' ''! 
And how do they stay so thin on all the meat. 
potatoes and mayo (they put it on everything) 
they eat? Hello, cholesterol. 

These stereotypes (a lbeit with a whole lot 
of merit) do not tran late themselves to the 
Irish people. Irish people are friendly, warm 
and he lpful. Sometimes, though, I would lind 
myself talking to someone and not under-
standing a word Ihey were saying. This was 
fine with me, because the Irish accent is so 
awesome to hear. 

A friend came to visit me in Stratforc\ after 
traveling through seven other countries, and 
we came to Ihis conclusion: We love Ameri -
ca! Everything works here. When we Ilush 
the toilet, the plumbing works. 

Americans are friendly. When you go into 
a McDonald 's for a Big Mac, you pay $1.99. 
In England, the menu "Iso lists it as £ 1.99. 
But that little "L" is a pound sign - you are 
actually ·paying almost four bucks. Li vi ng 
expenses are cheaper in America and people 
in general make more money here. Remem-
ber, we are living in the land of opportunity. 
We have supermarkets and hospitals (yes, 
hospi tals) open 24 hours a day. and we take it 
for granted . 

Don't gelllle wrong, I had a great time thi s 
summer. I have never been so happy to come 
home, though. I havc heard people complain 
that America has no hi story like Europe docs. 
Maybe we don ' t have cathedrals that date 
ba~k to thl: 1200~, ami yes, we arc a big smor-
gasbord of a popUlation that is largely from 
Europe, but you know what'! Europe is a nice 
place to visit, but I am so glad I live in Amer-
ica.

For students who live close to 
campus, public transportation may 
be the best choice. Students can 
obtai n a sticker from the Rideshare

For commuters who use the 

buses on a more rrequent basis, 
Rideshare orrers a $ 10 discount on 
monthly bus passes. 

To register ror any of the clubs 
or carpools, or to get a rree bus 
sticker, visit the Rideshare offi ce, 
located in Building 201, across 
from the Cashier's office in the 
middle of campus. For additional 
information, call Rideshare Oper-
ations 534-RJDE. 

Until construction actually 
begins, students can choose to fi ght 
their parking ballies alone or they 
can enlist the help of UCSD's 
Rideshare Operations . . Rideshare 
Operations oversees a variety of 
transportation and parking services 
on campus. 

Students can save time and 
money by joining one of 
Ridcshare's vanpools or carpools 
or by utilizing the various public 
transportation alternati ves that 
serve the campus.

One of the most accessible ser-
vices is Rideshare 's Carpools, 
which allows registered students 
to locate others who share the 
samc commute. Over 1,000 
UCSD students are already 
entered in the Rideshare Carpool 
database, increasing the likeli-
hood or new members finding a 
carpool in their area. Students in 
the program arc also rree to 
arrange their own carpool with 
friend s and neighbors. 

Either way, joining a Rideshare 
carp 01 can help you students save 
money. Carpools split the cost of a 

parking pennit, and, as a bonus, 
each rider will receive a free Occa-
sional Usc Permit, good for 10 free 
days of parking each quarter.

UCSD are also eligible to partici-
pate in the Rideshare Yanpool Pro-

P$ycho Therapy 
Welcome back UCSD, and here I 
go again, for the ruth time 
By Mary Higgins Senior Staff Writer 

Let me guess: At this moment 
you are si tt ing in a UCSO lecture 
hall and your professor is dr ning 
on and on about quantum theory. 
You probably gave up tak ing notes 
IS l1linut e~ ago Don't fccl guiltX' 
Everyone know~ that lecture i ~ des-
ignated as Gllardian Reading Time. 
Everyone except the prc-meds .. . 
They are too bu~y liddling with 
their hand-held recorders and click-
ing thei r four-colored hall point 
pens. 

Do you see that guy asleep in 
the chair in front or you - the one 
with the great tan '! He's dreaming 
about the vacation he took to Aruba 
with his g irlfriend . Give the back of 
hi s chair a lillie kick to welcome 
him bat:k to UCSD. That's right. 
summer is over and it 's Back-To-
School time! 

I guarantee that all throughout 
Welcome Week you wi ll be con-
stantly assault ed by religious fanat-
ic , over-zealous bike cops and 
evcry singlc organization on cam-
pus. On your way to cla~s I' ll bet 
you were hounded by credit-card 
representatives handing out T-
shirts. I n the bookstore, you 1'001-
ishly stood in line for two hours 
then helled oul enough money to 
fund a Third-World government. 

How do I know so much about 
UCSD? I' ve been a Trit on for 
almost half a decade! My name is 
Mary and I'm what you would call 
a liflh-year "Super Senior." The 
reason why I' ve been at this school 
for so long is because I can' t get 
enough of the lood at Canyon

WHAT. 
Card members get 1YtQ 
complimentary passes 10 

Maybe I 'll never win 
the Pulitzer Prize. 
Sometimes I 
exaggerate. 
Sometimes I poke 
fun at stuff that 
other people take 
seriously, like 
nudism. This is not 
good journalism. I 
just hope I made 
someone laugh this 
year. I would be 
happy knowing that 
at least once, some 
depressed 
undergraduate 
finished reading my 
column and decided, 
"pang, my life really 
isn't so bad." 
Vista. Also, at the end of my j unio~ 
yea r, I thought it would be fun to 
\:hange my major from \:ommuni -
cal ions to biology. 

As a co mm. major. I w uld ha ve 
graduat ed halfway through my 
freshman year. Instead I decided to 
"explore my options." Take it from 
me, exploring yo ur options is total-
ly unnecessary and wi II get your 
nowhere in life. Three nervous 

breakdowns and a rehabilitation 
clinic later, I'm a communications 
major again . 

Throughout this academil.: saga, 
I've worked as a writer for the 
Guardiall . Last year. I got the idea 
t slart my "Psychotherapy" col-
umn. The goa l was to have UCSD 
students e-mail me about their 
deepe t, darkest set:rets and then I 
would print them in the newspaper 
for the who!.; sehop l to sec. 

Funny how no one ever wrote 
in , For a while I just made up leI-
ters unlil a fri end pointed out that 
thi s was unethkal. 
Afler that I held a "Mos t Eli gi ble 
Bachelor of the Year" contest and 
the winner was a guy I nominated 
and voted for all by myself. So far, 
reader participation has been ~ather 
unimpress ive; my career as an 
advice columnist has consisted of 
whining about midterms and ridi -
cu ling engineers. 

Despite thi s, the Guardian Fea-
tu res edi tor asked me to continue 
my column for a second year. So 
here's the deal: If you guys send 
me some e-mail thi ' time then I 
won' t have to make stuff up or hold 
stupid contests like last year. Too 
embarrassed to sign the letter wi th 
your own name? Just use your 
roommate's! 

By the way, do you see that 
freakish icon up at the top of the 
page'? That 's not actually me. In 
rea lity, I look a lot like that chick 
from "The Mask of Zorro" but the

13 - the linal day of the an nual San Diego

They Might Be Giants both opened and

their new live album 'e l'ere TIre Damaxt'· 
The album features bolh siudio und protes-
sionally recorded live tracks thai span the 
length of the band 's career. and end ' wilh a

series of live improvisations thai all deal wi th 
"The Planet of the Apes." 

Both creative spontaneity and hard work 
help to create the playful , yet sincere, sound 
that makes They Mighl Be Giants so unique-
ly unique. . ' 

John Linnell explains, "Comll1g up wtth 
the ideas for our songs is a long process of 
,eeing where an idea goes - it 's not random. 
It 's like in the fourth Aliens film wh.:re 
Sigoul11cy Weaver is clon.:d ou t of 0 A. 
There's a scene in the lab where they did all 
the trials before Ihey came up wilh hcr, and 
there lIrc all these multlnt Sigourney Weavers

arc blobs n ating in tanks. That's kind of 
whal song writing is like for us - there art: a 
lot of blobs tloating in wnks hdore we come 
up with a good song." .' 

Linnell and Flansburgh mel I n high 
school in the latc '70s and began playing 
instruments and experi menting with their 
own music. Twenty years later. they have 
performed over 1,000 shows, released eight 
albums and had 14 lelevision appearances. 

This June, John Linnell placed ninth in Peo-
ple Maga~ifte Oliline's "Most Beautiful Peo-
ple" pole - just behind Madonna and a step 
above Sarah Michell e: Gellar from the TV 
series "Burry the Vampire Slayer." Either 
thi band has ve ry dedit:a ted fans , or Ameri -
t:a's delinition of beauty is evolving. 

Regardless of America's beauty stan-
dards, They Might Be Giants hal'e evolved 
from a duo into a fu II-tledged band. Origi-
nally Flansburgh (guita r. vocals) and Linnell 
(keyboard , accord ion, vot:als) sci out to the 
studio with the intention of sounding like a 
hand. With the help of multiple tracks, they 
prodUl:ed their lirst four album . For the past 
fi ve y.:a rs howev.: r, begi nning wi th the 
albuill Juil " 11/' /1/')', John and John have 
acquired a drummer, bassist. and hem ~e~ ti on 
to accompany th<.! m both in the studio and on 

the stage. 
"I think a lot of people thought we were 

making a wrong tum by trying to record a 
band," says Linnell. " I hope with John He!1ry 
und e pecia lly Factory SholVroom , our tans 
will get used to the idea. It's still us - it 's 
still 'do-it-yourself. '" 

Instead of trying to sound like a live 
band, the duo produced Factory SlwlVrou/li 
one track at a time in order to retai n the ori g-
inal sound. 

Li nnell ~ays that during his youth he 
admired musit:ians - sU\:h as Frank Zappa, 
Elvis ostello and the Residents - who hav.: 
deve loped their own methods of music-mak-
ing and have indtvidual sounds.

With its all-day concen lineup 
of rockin ' bands. thi s year's Vans 
Warped Tour fully met the incredi· 
bly high standards set in previou 
years. The day was bound to be 
good with Tilt opening the show. 
The day only improved with per-
formances by groups such as 
Strung Out and Bouncing Souls. 

A combination of punk rock and 
skateboarding make up Warped Tour, 
which has 68 U.S., European and 
Australian tour dates, The tour now 
includes more activities, making the 
event more eclectic. 

This year's tour featured events 
like the L.L.A.M.P./Warped Mural 
Project. where concert·gocrs were 
allowed to aid in the construction 
of a "mural around the world ." 
Pieces of the mural . after bei ng 
connected at the end of the tour, 
will be auctioned off for charit y. 

The Ernie Ball International 
Battle of the Bands, a new feature, 
gave many up-and-coming punk 
bands the chance to showcase their 
talents. Additionally, ' the event 
induded the Art De La Tour. con-
sisting of a welding sculpture stu-
dio and mural painter, who do large 
paintings at each venue. 

Punk Rock Karaoke took the

the best mu ician in the scene, 
including members of I!ad Rdi -
gion and.NOFX. 

Skate companies organized the 
Vans Warped.Tour. which housed an 
arena of vertical ramp skateboard -
ing. Professionals such as Chris liv-
ingston, Neal Hendrix and legend 
Steve Caba llero participated in th is 
event. One could almost/orget one-
·elf. and the thousands of other spec-
tators, while watching the skaters 
and listening to the blaring punk 
rock i"n the distalll;e. 

One event, the wet T-shirt con-
tes t, received less appreciati on 
from the audiem;e. There is no age 
limit to enter the Warped Tour and 
it was inappropriate to stage such a 
contest - especially considering 
the winner won because she look 
off her shirt. The contest gave the 
whole concen an unsaxory Ilavor

The international Warped Tour brings music 
and skateboarding to San Diego, a la punk 

- excluding women from the punk 
and skate scene by catering so bla-
tantly to men . 

" It is one thing to have more 
diverse bands, but it is another 1.0 
make it a damn jock festival wi lh a 
wet T-shirt contest," audience-
member Blai ne Critchfi eld said. 
"You might as well have a beer 
guzzl ing contes!." It is obvious the 
promoters - who included ~uch 
bands as Ozomatli and Deftones -
intended for Ihe evenl to be more 
diverse then in pas I years . Howev-
er, they shouldn', have 10 sacrifice 
the punk-rock cu lture in order to 
achieve Ihi diversity. 

Keeping with Ihe punk tradition 
were such gurus as NOFX, Rancid, ' 
and Bad Religion. NOFX, though 
lacking true punk rock attitudes, 
pleased Ihe I,;rowd by deli vering 
classics from their more rowdy days. 

Rancid, addr..:ssing the attitudes 
of people in the audience, delivered 
a message of a\.:l,;eptance. They 
encouraged people to nOI purpose-
ly hurt one another, both in and out 
of the pit. 

Tim Armstrong and an African 
American member of the Specials 
performed together, illuslrating the 
benefils of diversity. They encour-
aged people in the pit to help each 
other up when Ihey fell. 

Bad Religion also rocked the 
crowd and delivered what appeared 
to be the audience's favorite perfor-
mance.

By Marc Comer 
Senior Staff Writer 

Being under 21 can severely 
limit entertainment possibilities in 
San Diego. but if you've been 
forced to seek out good, d ean fun 
then the play "Triple Espresso" is 
the best place to stan. 

"Triple Espresso" is the most 
unique form of comedy I have ever 
seen. It is a hybri9 c; ross between a 
play and a comedy show. There is 
very little improvisation, but there 
is interaction with the audicnc;e. so 
beware of the front row. Regardless 
of what it is, I laugbed so hard my 
eyes watered. 

The show tell s the story of how 
three entertainers are thrown 
together as a trio c;alled Triple 
Espresso. Hugh Butternut (Peter 
Breitmayer), BUZl Maxwell ( cott 
Cervine), and Bobby Bean (Joe 
Gautier) find themselves reunited 
in the show, telling the hilarious 
stories of their pi t.iful attempts and 
embarrassing moments in show biz. 

"We were never a c;omedy team-

Maxwelf, BULtemut and Bean. 

The show i ~ tai lored to tit the 
individual talents of each actor. 
Breitmayer's specialty is the piano 
along with a decent singing voic;e. 
Thus Hugh Butternut has found hi s 
career bouncing in and out of 

The UCSD Guardian Tuesday, September 22, 1998 

You 'll shake with excitement at this 
stimulating comedy 

lounges. Cervine's talent is magic, 
so Buzz Maxwe ll , with hi s pro b-
lemati c deli very, often nubs his 
magic tri c;ks mistakenly reveali ng 

. their secrets to the audience. Gauti-
er plays the guitar. And so hi s char-
acter, Bobby Bean, unaware that he 
has very little talent, repeatedly 
finds hi s horrible tune and terrible 
sense of st y Ie being laughed at. 

In its erfort to "make it big," the 
trio is gi ven the chance to entertain 
at a Kiwani s luncheon, is booked 
for a gig on Cable Zaire and per-
forms on the old "Mi chael Douglas 
.Show." Each time, however, the 
team fall s shon. 

This group of al: tors has a vari -
ety of experi ence. Breitmayer has 
been in movies sut:h as "Jingle A Ii' 
Ihe Way" and television s h ()w~ 
such as NBC's "Just Shoot Me." 
Cervine is no slouch either. He is 
the onl y magkian ever named 
"Enlertainer of the Year" two years 
in a row. Gautier has appeared with 
artists such as Amy Grant and MC 
Hammer and is currently working 

on a CO entitled Your Average Joe. 
Additionally, each perfo rmer has 
been in pl ays acro~s the country. 

From beginning to end , 
''Triple Espresso" keeps you 
laughing with its spoofs. It is 
quile possibly the best 
abdominal workout ever. 
The actors play orf each 
other so well ·that you can' t 
hclp but laugh at their anti cs. 
It's one of the few shows 
around 'that you can see 
more than ont:e and 
still get your money's

She then "blacked out" and didn ' t 
even noti t:e that they were dead 
until she was washing the blood otT 
her hands. 

As twisted as thi s show may 
seem, its basis in real events makes 
"Chicago" a fun diversion fro m the 
stereotypical musica l scenario of 
boy meets and then fall s in love 
with girl. The only type of falling 
seen in this show is the fall of hus-
bands or lovers as they are killed by 
their assertive female companions. 

Six different casts perform the 
show around the world, from New 
York 10 Vienna to Australia . Two 
groups tour the United States, one 
of whi ch performed at the San 
Diego Civic Theatre Sept. 1-6, and 
another wh ich will perform in the 
Orange County area. 

The San Diego Playgoers sea-
son at the San Diego Civic Theatre 
t:o ntinues with "Cirque Ingenieux" 

GOOD EATS: 
Prices range from 
student to Bill Gates 
Continued from page Bl0 
and rice (with or without sausage ror 
vegetarians). Also, don't forget to 
order the hush puppies. An appetiz-
er-size portion ind udes eight to 10 
tasty fried balls of cornmeal. a must 
for any Cajun meal. 

During those late ni ght study 
sess ions. there's always Denny's at 
6908 Miramar Road. Or, just a lit-
tle further away is the popular late 
nig ht UCS D hangout Roberto's. 
located at 670!l Miramar Rd. It is 
open 24 hours a day and provides 
decent, cheap Mex ican rood. 

A bit further down the road is 
Cotija 's, located at IU92 Gamet Ave. 
in Pac; itic Beach, a popul ar late-night 
Mexit:an eatery for t:ollege students. 
It 's inexpensivt: and the portions are 
huge! Try the ro lled t aco~ . 

On the same block is luck U.,

Tickets for shows generally 
range from $25-$60. Some money-
saving tips for the co llege student 
on a budget include: 

I. Look th ro ugh the ads in 
newspapers to see when the show 
will have a "Balcony Rush." One 
hour before the show you can buy 
balcony tickets for about $12- 15 
but buyers must pay cash. Rush 
ticket holders will need binoculars. 
They t:a n be rented for $5 a pair at 
the theater. 

2. Go 10 the "Arts Tix" booth at 
Horton Plaza, downtown (located 
on the street level in front of the 
entrance of Planet Hollywood). 
They se ll ti ckets for different 
shows at half price on the day of 
the perfonnam;e.

fee t places to satisfy late-night

Staff Writer 

Thom as Kinkade's paintings 
bare a striking resembl ance to La 
Jolla 's quaint, seaside m.: ighbor, 
Del Mar. Kink'ade's paintings are 
mos t memorable for thei r use of a 
wonderfu I array of colors that 
give the impression of a soft shad-
ow engulfin g the frame . 
Kinkade's paintings are visually 
warm and peaceful. What the 
viewer sees is what the viewer 
gets ; in thi s sense, Del Mar won-
drously parallels Kinkade's mes-
meri zing paintings. 

If one decides to take North Tor-
rey Pines Road away from UCS D 
instead of Interstate 5, he or she 
begi ns to enter a world far removed 
from commercialil.ed La Jolla. The 
traffi c reduces in volume, beautiful 
tree ' hover over the highway, and 
the ·teep roadside hills givt.: way to 
gorgeous views of the Paci fil.: 
Ocean. 

Everyone dri ves leisurely ; one 
can crui se along slowly enough to 
watch white , foamy waves crash 0 11 
the sand. Just a few miles away 
from our familiar territory. the sun 
worshippers seem more relaxed 
and content to soak up the beautiful 
surroundings. 

Del Mar seems to have the same 

effect on its visitors and residents 
as Kinkadc's paintings ha ve on 
their admirers. Those who enter 
this beautiful tommunity by the sea 
quickl y becomc engulfed by 
nature's serenity. 

Although the thought of living 
in a Kinkade ponr:lit sounds 
appealing at times, the reality is 
that crawling along at a snail 's pace 
for an extended period of time 
loses its appea l. Once you have 
li ved in a city anything much slow· 
er hecomes grating on city-fo lk , 
especia lly co llege student s. 

Camino del Mar, the main hub 
of life in Del Mar, boasts a number 
of art galieries, cafes, boutiques 
and other sto res with knick-knacks 
to line onc's shelves. Familiar 
eateries such as Johnny Rocket's, [J 
Fornaio and. of course, Starbucks 
may catch a ci ty person's tra ined 
eye. 

Othcr than that, Del Mar does 
not olla a wide variety of .pl aces 
for a UCSD partygoer to re lease 
the stress and tension accompany-
ing a full week of dashing from 
York to Warren Lecture Hall in 15 
minutes nat. 

Del Mar is a great retreat for it

the ultimate atrocity in "Armaged-

Album Reviews 

Irt.n Wilson 
Imagination 

-~-'/"-
-•• *. 

Listening to a new Brian Wilson 
album is like reading a new Charles 
Schultz PeanlJls strip ; it 's worth it 
to see what goes through the old 
guy's mind, regardless of how 
bizarre that might be. 

With his new album, ImaRina· 
li!Jn, the less-redusive-than-he- ' 
used-to-be former heart-and-soul 
of the Beal:h Boys provides the lis-
tener with some bizarre moments, 
but those are easily offset by a few 
great songs. Most of the record, 
though, showcases Wilson 's Iyril:al 
mastery and the vQl:al harmonics 
he pioneered, wi thout breaking any 
new ground. 

What is remarkable about this 
album is Wilson's abi lity, in tracks 
like "Your Imagination," to put the 
surf-rock days of the Beach Boys in 
a wistful historical contex!. Lines 
like "You know it would 've been 
nlcellf 1 had somethi ng to do" high-
light the pathos of old Beach Boys 
songs like "Wouldn ' t It Be Nice" 
without sinking into nmtalgia . 

Every once in a whi le, though. 
Wil son seems to go completely orf 

hi s rocker. as in the Jimmy Buffet 
team-up "South American," Thi~ 
song seems mostly to be about 
what words rhyme ("I've been 
around too long to care what any-
one says/I'm hungry and I'm doin' 
lunch with Cameron Diaz" -
lyrics that have nothing to do with 
the rest of the song). 

Even the bizarre moments are at 
least intriguingly bizarre, and still a 
blast for fans of alltbe best parts of 
the Beach Boys.

suite version at the conclusion of 
The LoSI Tribe. The "Suite" is the 
more interesting of the two, carry-
ing the li stener on a soni l.: odyssey 
through jungles and fores ts and vil-
lages and into, one supposes, a 
dance club. II ' ~ not ncarly as 
appallingly se lf-i ndulgent as it 
might sound, but it 's not exactly 
innovative either. 

Other highlights on the EP are a 
loud-and-angry goth -industrial 
remix by Empirion and a dub-
heavy "DJ Ming & FS Drum 'n' 
Bass Remi x," both of which throw 
out mo~t of the origi nal track in 
fa vor of more modern instrumenta-
tion. Unfortunately, these remi xes 
'onl y serve to emphasize t he lack of 
inventiveness in the rest of the EP.

How Stella Got Her Groove Back 

-••••• 
"Ah, yeah. II 's time to get our 

groove back." 
So begins the soundtrack to the 

movie "How Stella Got Her Groove 
Bac k". Based on the book by Terry 
McMillan. who is also the author of 
Wailin ll 10 Exhale, Terry McMillan, 

the CD provides an excellent mix-
ture of R&B and relaxing jazz. 

Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis 
write, produce and arrange the CD 
for Flyte Tyme productions. It fea-
tures 14 songs by various artists, 
and ski llfully utili zes the skills of 
these artists to add Ii fe to the movie 
starring Ange la Bassel. 

This mix includes prominent 
anists such as K-Ci & JoJo, Mary 1. 
Blige, Stevie \'Vonder & Wydef Jean. 
Me'Shell Ndegcocello, and Boys J] 
Men. The relaxing, soulful music is 
excellent for long, warm baths, 
studying, intrQspective thinking or a 
well planned, romantic dinner. 

To quote one li stener, this CD is 
inl.:redibly sexy. II evokes images 
of romantic interludes and island 
vacations. Beautiful. soulful 
singing, coupled with the back-
ground of a Jamaican beat , keeps 
the Jamaican rhythms a constant 
pan of the CD's flavor. 

The lyrics of the songs are sim-
ple, including I:horuses such as 
.• ever say never again," "Make my 
body hot." and "Baby if you want to 
get a chanl:e with me, baby girl you 
got to dance with me, tonight." 
However. the music and the voices 
of the arti ~ t s stand out as the most 

impres~ive aspects of the album. 
Boys II Mcn perform one of the 

best songs on the CD. "Your Place 
Is in My Heart." features a very tal-
ented Chante Moore. Lyrics 
include sentcnces like, "Far across 
the sea, I can hear you calling me," 
and. "No Illatter where you are. 
you ' re always in Ill y heart ," 
Despite the simpli ~ ti c lyri cs. the 

Tuesday, September 22, 1998 

smooth voices of the performers 
and the symphony background 
allow the song to invoke fee lings of 
longing for a loved one. 

In keeping with the spirit of the 
movie's characters, the arrangers of 
the CD made it their goal to mix a 
variety of sounds and integrate the 
beats of Jamaican musicians along 
with American jazz. Talented R&B 
artists provide an ec lect ic. yet 
smooth, sound that will appeal to a 
diverse audience. 

Rather than the expected stan-
dard , easily c lassi li ed album, 
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis uti -
li zed their resources to create very 
di ver e music se lections from tal-
ented arti sts. 

Whether R&B , jazz or reggae 
appeal to you, thi s CD provides an 
excellent background sound for 
relaxation during a hectic school 
day. It also provides a very sexy 
soundtrack for students looking for 
a little variety in their music selec-
tion. The flow Siella Gal fler 
Groove Back Soundtrack expertly 
compliments the entertaining book 
and romantic movie for which it 
was designed.

Book Review 
Coming of Age 

in Babylon, 
finding your own 

reality 
In hi s book, Coming of ARe ill 

Babyloll , Filldillil YOllr Own Reali-
ty, author Doug De Bias attempts to 
address social issues relevant to 
readers between the ages of l!l and 
24. Through social topics such as 
homosexuality, per 'onal evolution, 
drugs, education and masturbation, 
De Bias attempts to demonstrate 
hi s own version of reality. 

It is ev ident that De Bias views 
the six ties as an ideal time in 
American history. The book focus-
es on t he crea tion of personal 
identity and indi viduality, and he 
refers back to hi s hippie youth for 
examples and advi ce. 

Yet, hi s constant disclaimer -
that he isn' t omnipotent . and is 
just givi ng another person an 
opportunity to see his point of 
view - seems to make him more. 
rather then less. patroni zi ng. 

The problem with this book is 
not the politics he espouses. In facl. 
his ideas arc congruent with the 
beliefs of many ·tudents of this 
generation. Rather, hi s lax attitude 
and ineffec ti ve argumentation 
make it difficult to accept hi s ideas

"Students don' t really bother 
us ," Vi zconde said. "Some people 
don't even know this is a part of the 
university." 

Cent ral Plant houses half-a-

without feeling like one is buying 
into an easi Iy generated. anti-estab-
li shment philosophy. 

Written ina very casual vernac-
ular, De Bias uses slang and foul 
language to appeal to his audience. 
Perhaps by using thi s language, he 
feels a greater tie to the younger 
generation. In the end, the book 's 
language just emphasizes hi ' con-
descension towards today 's youth. 
His attempt to come oil as an 
understanding expert shows that he 
has underestimated the language 
skills of his "coming-of-agers." 

De Bias' libera l front disguises 
hi s disillusionment with today 's 
world ci tizens. In discussing com-
munica tion empires. or as he sug-
gests. the "Disinformation age." he 
cautions students to be wary of the 
media. However, rather than elrec-
ti vely making an argument based 
on facts and rea lity. he bases his 
point on generalizations about cor-
porate America. 

"And eve rybody has something 
to se lL" argues De Bias. "Poli ti-
cians (why do they always. come 
up'! ). religion~ (they can' t all be 
right). institutes of higher educa-
tion (We' re perfect for you. Pick 
us), boys (I love you). gi rls (of

Rather then using spec ific

other civi li zations combined. In 
this instance, hi s use of data 
emphasizes his poi nt , and makes 
his argument more effecti ve. 

In order to prove his point of 
view, De Bias uses the work of 
other intellectuals, sud1 as Mark 
Twain, as support. The 1TIost articu -
late arguments in the book are 
made by the people he quotes.

rcshmen orientation i~ 
often remembered as a 
somewhat uneventful 
introduction to the cam-
pus consisting of T-Reg. 

residence hall . campus restaurants 
and a few fell ow freshmen. For a 
fortunate few. though. " the lun-
nels" fi gure In the 'lOries told at 
orientation. 

For instance, my orientation 
leader took great delight in describ-
ing the tunnels to hi s group of 
incoming freshman. There are tun-
nels everywhere underneath our 
campus. he exp lained. He 
described them as dark and musty, 
with waler running through the bot -
10m anu plant roots pushing 
through cracks in their concn:le 
walls. 

He tolu us na'lve freshmen that 
when the uni vers ity was built. the 
administration. ever fearful of stu -
dent rebe ll ion, had put them in so 
that S.W.A .T. teams could move 
quickl y and secretly to the si te of a 
student uprisi ng. Appearing sud-
denly out of manhole covers. they 
would be able to stop a potential 
riot before It started. 

Furthermore. my ori entation 
leader said he had a friend who had 
once broken into a tunnel. The 
friend had seen it for himself, so we 
could rest assured that th is was an 
accurate description. 

Of course, thi s orientation 
leader al so told us that the engi-
neering bui lding had a giant pin in 
the basement th ill, if pulled, would 
cause the entire building to col-
lapse. (Obvious ly. no one ever 
fou nd it.) 

In reality, my orientati on leader 
was a bit mistaken. He was right 

about a few things. though. There 
arc tunnels under UC D. and they 
do run to most of the major build-

ing~ . They were not built for riot 
police. storing radioactive wa~te, or 
any other nefariou~ purpose. 
Rather. they are simple lIlility cor-
ridors. and nothing more, des igned 
to connect campus buildings to the 
Central Uti lities Plant. 

Racks on the wall s of the tun-
nels hold power lines . phone lines 
and fiber optic cables. Underneath 
the racks run large pipe~ that carry 
water and stearn. Enough space i~ 
lert in the center of the tunnel to 
allow maintenance crews lO walk 
through. The comhination of pipe~ 
and wire~. concrete wa l b anu 
slightly dim lighting gives the tun-
ncb a simi lar atmosphere to the 
ba~ements of AP&M or York Hall . 

All the tunnels connect back to 
the Ce ntral Utilit ies Plant. The 
Central Plant is a complex of struc-
tures loca ted at the co rner of 
Gilman Drive and Scholars Drive 
South. 

Originally built as part of Rev-
elle college in 11)61. Central Plant 
has been expandi ng more or less 
continua ll y si nce it s creation. The 
Central Plant chilled water tank 
(the large green monolith that 
looms over Scholars Drive). is one 
of the fir. t things many visitors to 
UCSD see as they enter campus, 
although few realize what it is. 
Even mo t faculty and students 
don't know the purpose of the 
plant. 

Rod Vizconde, the Central Uti l-
ities Plant Superintendent. said he 
realizes that onl y a few people on 
campus know about the entral
