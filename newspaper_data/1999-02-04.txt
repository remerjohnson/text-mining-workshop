BERKELEY, Calif. -
Lawyers from the NAACP, 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union and the Mexican-
American Legal Defense and 
the Educational Fund filed a 
federal class-action lawsuit 
on behalf of eight minority 
students against UC Berkeley 
on Tuesday over its admis-
sions process. The plaintiffs 
said the admissions process 
is discriminatory and that the 
university 's delinition of 
"merit" is in violation of fed-
eral civil rights laws. The 
students' lawyers argue that 
each of the eight applicants 
had outstanding academic 
and extracurricular back-
grounds, but were denied 
entrance into the university 
because the admissions crite-
ria emphasizes S.A.T. scores 
and weighted grade point 
averages. The plaintiffs ' 
attorneys say the weight 
placed on S.A.T. scores is 
discriminatory because not 
all students have access to 
S.A .T. preparation classes or 
advanced placement classes. 
1be case, which is now 
known as Jesus Rios vs. UC ' 
Regents, names UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Robert Berdahl, 
the UC Board of Regents and 
UC President Richard 
Atkinson as defendants in the 
lawsuit. The students' 
lawyers request that the eight 
plaintiffs, who are attending 
other universities. would be 
provided prompt admittance 
to the university if they win 
the case.

Starting on Feb. 10, the essay 
portion of the Graduate 
Management Admission Test 
(GMKf) will be graded by a 
computer called the E-rator. 
The computer grader will 
replace the human grader 
who gives the second score 
on the essay section of the 
exam. A representative for the 
Graduate Management 
Admissions Council, which is 
the board that oversees the 
administration of the GMAT, 
said the computer scoring 
will increase the speed of the 
admissions process because 
students will be informed of 
their scores faster. The E-
rator will read for an intro-
duction, a conclusion and 
strong topic sentences. A 
human and the E-rator will 
score essays on a scale of 
zero to six. If those two 
scores differ by more than 
one point, then another 
human will decide the final 
grade.

Committee 
Proposes New 
Apartments 
HOUSING: Barrett says that 
construction is scheduled to 
begin in Spring 2<XX> 
Kl-Mln 5unC 
Senior Staff ~iter 

As student enrollment continues to 
increase at UCSD. the university has begun 
considering plans to build another on-cam-
pus apartment complex to deal with the 
impact on available housing. 

A committee composed of students, fac-
ulty and staff is currently discussing the best 
site for the apartments, which students will 
be eligible for the housing and the number 
and type of units . The committee will also 
deliberate on the most efficient manner for 
building the apartments, the economic 
effects they would have and related social 
issues . 

Committee member Thomas Bond, the 
Revelle College provost, said that there has 
been a recent increase in demand for on-
campus housing and as a result, a shortage. 

"The campus has gone from having 
housing vacancies to having more students 
who want to live on-campus than we have 
space for in a very short period of time," 
Revelle Provost Thomas Bond said. 

Bond said that on-campus student hous-
ing is beneticialto students and that students 
themselves recognize that. 

" 'think we should do everything we can 
to put alfordable student housing as close as 
possible," Bond said. "My feeling about 
housing is that if you build it and the cost is 
competitive, it will be filled ." 

Larry Barrett, director of housing and 
dining services, said that the committee will 
determine the type of units in the complex, 
namely how many rooms each apartment 
will have. One of the major considerations is 
whether it will be low density housing -
which is typically more expensive - or 
high density housing that could accommo-
date more individuals per apartment unit. 

The committee is also considering which 
students will have priority in the apartments 
- graduate students, undergraduates, med-
ical students, or transfer students. 

"In reality, it will probably be a trade-off 
with upper-division students and maybe first 
and second-year graduate students," Bond 
s;Pd. 

Barrett said the site is likely to be east of 
the freeway, close to the present Mesa on-
campus housing located near Regents Rd. 

''The actual cost of the unit is going to be 
higher, but the proximity to the campus is a 
tremendous benefit to students." Bond said. 

Barrell said that the committee will work 
toward the goal of beginning construction in 
the spring of 2000. To increase overall effi-
ciency and the speed with which this apart-

will serve as co-chief scientists and will lead an Inter-
national team of scientists from England. France. 
Germany, India, Maldives. Mauritius. the Netherlands. 
Sweden. and the United States. 

Aerosol cooling is one of the largest remaining 
sources of uncertainty in the predicting Mure climate_ 
Data provided during the experiment will provide sci-
entists with crucial information needed to develop 
more accurate global climate prediction models. 

The Center for Clouds, Chemistry and Climate was 
established at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 
1991. The goal of the National Science Foundation 
Science and Technology Center is to improve our 
understanding of cloud-chemistr)"'Climate interactions, 
thereby enhancing our knowledge of the climate sys-

A.S. Marketing Director 
Died in Car Crash Sunday 
OInullY: A memorial 
for Chris Shelton held on 
Wednesday was attended 
by staff and students 
By ErIc irK. 
Staff Writer 

Chris Shelton, the Associated 
Students marketing coordinator, 
died at 28-years-of-age on Sunday 
evening after losing control of his 
car on Pershing Drive near Balboa 
Park. Unable to control the car, 
Shelton crossed into oncoming 
traffic and collided head-on with a 
van. A memorial service was held 
on Wednesday and attended by 
both staff and students. 

Shelton moved to California 
last summer from Oklahoma, 
leaving a marketing position at 
Harold's department stores. 

He was one of the first mem-
bers of UCSD's new staff market-
ing department. Shelton began 
work on Sept. I. of this year and 
A.S. Vice President of Finance Pat 
Ru said his presence was immedi-
ately felt. 

"I was one of the first to meet 
him in the summer," Ru said. "He 
was a very. very cool guy. He was 
kicked back [but also) very pro-
fessional." 

Eric Rovner, A.S. director of 
development, said that Shelton's 
care for students, bod! those he 

worked with and those of the cam-
pus at large, made him perfect for 
the marketing position. 

"He wanted to make a big 
impact on the campus," Rovner 

of his UCSD and life experience. 
"Every day I put on my thing-

to-do list to speak to Chris." 
Leventhal said. "I don't think I've 
seen anybody so enthusiastic ... and 

said. "He wanted to 
unite the colleges. 
He wanted to estab-
lish traditions at 
UCSD." 

A.S. Director of 
Athletic Relations 
Robert Gordon said 
that Shelton had 
planned to draw in 
more sponsors and 
notable performers to 
UCSD. Shelton 
arranged the bands 
for Winterfest, as 
well as the upcoming 
engagement with 
Maya Angelou.

Shelton's ContIbutions to 
Programming Not Forgotten 

Today, renowned poet and intellectual Maya 
Angelou will grace us with her presence. As part of 
her presentation this evening, Angelou will be recit-
ing poetry, reading from her books, singing as well as 
talk about her life. Her visit, titled "An Evening with 
Maya Angelou" is in commemoration of Black 
History Month. 

We are fortunate enough to have Angelou come to 
campu.s because of the hard work of the A.S. pro-
gramming department, especially that of the late 
Chris Shelton. 

Shelton, who was A.S. marketing coordinator, 
died in a car accident at Balboa Park last Sunday. He 
will be remembered for his unique approach to event 
programming on campus. 

In the past, A.S. programming has primarily pro-
vided UCSD with musical performances, paying 
particular allention to popular musical trends . 
While these performances draw the campus togeth-
er and provide a good time, they do little to enlight-
en us. Shelton broke the pattern of inviting solely 
popular musical groups to campus by inviting 
Angelou . A school focused upon academics is 
appreciative of a talk by an acclaimed poet; 
although Shelton will not be here to receive the 
appreciation he deserves, his efforts will not go 
unnoticed. 

The event sold out in just a few days, which is 
indicative of the positive impact Angelou's visit is 
having on our faculty and student body and UCSD's 
desire to allend stimulating events. On a campus 
where the sciences dominate, and the humanities and 
social sciences are pushed to one side, it is impressive 
that Angelou's visit has been regarded so highly. 
Angelou is a welcome relief from the intense acade-
mic pressure which midterms usually produce at this 
til)le in the quarter. 

A.S. programming should be congratulated for its 
efforts and commitment to change the face of pro-
gramming at UCSD. We hope A.S. will continue to 
recognize and respect the need for quality, intelligent 
programming. 

Shelton'S contributions will no doubt be recog-
nized and respected not only by the programming 
department, but by the student body as a whole.

REPUBLICANS SCOUR PARTY 
FOR OVAL OFFICE CONTENDER 
COMMENTARY: 
Grand Old Party. must 
search for a torchbearer, 
someone to defeat Gore 
By Tommy Vu 
Staff Writer 

As the 1998 November election 
came to an end, a new campaign 
immediately staned. The losers look 
toward the new millennium for anoth-
er chance at a state assembly seat, a 
state senate seat or a congre!>.~ional 
seat. Some politicians have their eyes 
on a big, comfonable leather chair that 
is protected with six pieces of ~evlar 
and located in an elliptical shaped 
room. This is the chair of the president 
of the United States. 

Whoever this next president is, he or 
she will be the first president elected in 
the 21 st century, leading the nation into 
a new, uncertain era. Though the elec-
tion is more than a year away, many 
names have already been proposed to 
become the United States' next leader, 

On the Democratic side, the choices 
are rather obvious: the Democratic pres-
idential nominee will most likely be 
either Vice-President AI Gore or House 
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, the 
epitome of Democratic ideals. Senator 
and Vietnam War-hero Bob Kerrey wiil 
put up a good tight, but it is unlikely he 
will win the nomination. 

On the Republican side, however, 
things are far from clear-cut. For the 
first time in a generation. there is no 
sure leader. 11lere is no heir apparent as 
there was when George Bush took over 
the presidency from Ronald Reagan. 
Instead, the "Grand Old Pany" is divid- . 
ed into factions. These divided pans are 
arguing and bickering amongst them-
selves, allowing Democrats to sweep 
important congressional seats from 
under the Republicans' feet. 

Looking at the Republican presi-
.jential candidate roster, one question

..... kedto ... . 
running mate for the 
nominee. 
comes to mind: Will any of the candi-
dates have a chance at defeating AI 
Gore, the most likely Democratic nom-
inee? Leading the pack, which includes 
familiars such as Lamar Alexander, Pat 
Buchanan and Steve Forbes, are four 
popular and very influential names: 
George W. Bush Jr., Elizabeth Dole, 
Dan Quayle and John McCain. 

As familiar as these names are, many 
wonder if they have what it takes to beat 
Gore. Some are still asking if the poten-
tial candidates' histories. or even family 
name. will prove to be their undoing. 

Let us take Bush Jr. as the lim exam-
ple. Like the Kennedy family, the Bush 
family is a politically influential family. 
Bush Jr. is the prodigal son of former 

president George Bush and is ~ cur-
renl governor of Texas. His brother, Jeb 
Bush, is the new governor of Florida. 

Of course, carrying the name 
"Bush" has both advantages and disad-
vantages. Bush was the president thlll 
freed Kuwait from the tyrannical grasp 
of Saddam Hussein. He also helped tear 
down the Iron Curtain and smash the 
Berlin Wall. On the flip side, he was 
also the president that vomited on the 
lap of the Japanese prime minister, and 
no one will ever forget the infamous 
"Read my lips: No new taxes" promise. 

However, when push comes to 
shove, Bush Jr. can and will stand free 
from the shadows of his father's great 
accomplishments and terrible mistakes. 

As governor of Texas, Bush Jr. has 
made a name for himself and has 
proved to be a woiiby politician in his 
own right. After defeating the popular 
incumbent governor, Democrat Ann 
Golding, Bush Jr. pulled together a 
divided Texas and has pushed the state 
to new heights. 

With his many accomplishments 
allowing him to step out from under 
his father'S shadow and with Texas on 
his side, Bush Jr. is a strong contender 
for the GOP nomination and possibly 
the presidency. 

A second name brought up constant-
ly is Elizabeth Dole, wife of Senator 
and 1996 presidcntial-conlCnder ~ob 
Dole. With 1994 dubbed as the "Year of 
the Woman," it is only litting that 2001 
could be considered the "Year of the 
Woman: Part 2." With Elizabeth Dole, 
this is a real possibility. 

Similar to Bush Jr., Dole must 
break free from the burden that her last 
name carries. Obviously, it would be 
harder for Dole to distance herself 
from her husband for just that fact. 
Though Elizabeth Dole is .a common 
name in American households, her 
abilities and past accomplishments arc 
not as well known.

CONDEMNATION INEVITABLE GOP: Quayle's past will 
cost him his future 

His face has physically matured 
over the past eight years. The gray 
streaks in his hair and bags under 
his eyes give him a slightly more 
"worldly" aura. But as mature, 
knowledgeable or wise as he may 
now seem, unfortunately Quayle's 
past mistakes still bog him down. 11;.... SlOp ThUll :; BERTRAND AN 

500 tail lensths from the trash 
cans'l I went through one and then 
through an open smen door, and I 
found this really weird place. There 
was food everywhere, in every 
room - piles of it in every comer! 
It must have been accumulating for 
months and in the shon time that I 
was there, I lived like a king. And 
then the residents tried·to kill me." 

Of course, I don't contribute to 

A funny thing happened to me 
the other day. I went to class (that 
isn't it) and returned to my apan-
ment to find a note on the door 
advising me of "Health and Safety 
Hazard Checks from February 

-OPINION-. I to February 8. "11le llign was a bit ironic because just the 
day before I was describing to 
my friend about how my 
ipaltmcnt was a "health and 
safety hazard."

I have. feeling someone let the 

word out to Health Services and 
now they are targeting my floor. 
Either that or they want to confis-
cate the new mold research we've 
been doing and patent it as a cure 
for cancer. 

When someone asks me what 
sets my apartment apan from any 
other college apartments. I usually 
reply, "the mice." Other apartments 
might have a mouse, but we have 
mice. 

You really have to wonder what 
kind of stories mice tell after they 
leave our apartment. My guess is 
that they are a little something like 
this: "Hey, you know those rectan-
gular holes in the concrete about

this mess. I actually have a theory 
that the mice take all my crap and 
randomly strew it across the apan-
ment. They must work in teams and 
projects. For example, moving my 
calculus book from my desk to the 
living-room coffee table requires a 
team of \0 mice, while getting a 
bottle of Jolt - mysteriously pur-
chased with my meal points -
from Earl's Place all the way to our 
carpet (on its side and leaking Jolt) 
requires merely three mice. 

I actually saw our carpet once. 
when we got here in September, 
but that was such a long time ago 
that I've forgotten the color. I also 
remember when people could actu-
ally sit on our couch and at times 
stretch their entire body across it. 

Back in September. when ice 
cube trays held iee and the sink 
wasn't overflowing with stolen 
cafCleri. utensils and dishes, I was 
actually able to walk from one 
room to another without wading 
through two feet of trash. 

Speaking of trash, I'm thinking 
of lobbying the student council to 
move the trash receptacles to just 
outside our screen door. Sure, it 

would smell bad, but think of the 
convenience: "Gee, I don't want 
this pastrami sandwich anymore. 
I'll just throw it out the window." 
Walking 20 feet to the receptacles 
is just too far. One would have to 

walk there AND back. That's 40 
feet right there. 

The recycling containers are 
even worse. 11ley only take one can 
at a lime and have those silly rub-
ber flaps on the hole that make it 
difficult to push the can through. 
Do they serve any purpose or are 
they merely making ~re that I 
don't try to recycle those really 
long aluminum poles lying around 
my apanment? 

I can't wait until the people 
from Health and Safety come to 
check my apanment. I'll open the 
door and say, "Hi! There are five 
mice in this room. Have fun catch-
ing them!"

C ....... d ..... ,.... 
Dole is a fonner president of 

the Red Crms and a charismatic 
speaker. At the Republican 
National Committee in 1996. she 
amazed many delegates (and the 
nation) by giving a fantastic 
impromptu speech. 

It is unclear. though. if she will 
be known as her own person or as 
the compassionate wife of an 
uncompassionate senator. While 
in the senate with the position of 
majority leader, Bob Dole was 
known as a conservative hard 
liner with a hot temper. This is the 
opposite of Elizabeth Dole's char-
acter, but the stigma of Bob Dole 
and the fact that he is her husband 
remains as pan of her image. 

Despite this, Americans will 
not judge her by husband's 
actions, both the positive and neg-
ative ones. She has broken out of 
the mold and has successfully 
stood on her own. Some, however, 
still think that this will not be 
enough for Elizabeth Dole to 
defeat the Democratic presidential 
nominee. While "Dole" will not be 
an anchor keeping her down, she 
lacks experience in the field of 
American politics. As prestigious 
as being the president of the Red 
Cross may be, it is still very differ-
ent from being governor of a state 

-or vice president of a country. 
Speaking of vice presidents, 

Dan Quayle once again has taken 
an interest in running for the exec-
utive office. This time his chances 
are better, but not good enough. 

Though he is currently couning 
the religious right, there is not 
enough support for Quayle to win 
the Republican nomination. And 
even if he does win the nomina-
tion, the American people may or 
may not look past all his debacles. 
How can anyone forget the potato 
spelling incident? Self-innicted' 
mistakes. even minor ones like 
that, can cost a person his or her 
career. In the case of Quayle, his 
mistakes have cost him any chance 
at the presidency. 

So, of the Republican pack, 
Elizabeth Dole has risen up as a 
possible contender, but realistical-
ly, she will not receive the nomi-
nation. There is, however, a good 
chance that she might be asked to 
be a running mate for the nominee. 

In my opinion, that leaves 
only two major contenders in the 
ring: Senator John McCain of 
Arizona and Governor Bush Jr. 

Lately. Mct::ain has caused a 
ruckus in Congress. and even in the 
Republican Pany, pushing and 
advocating laws aimed at campaign 
finance and anti-tobacco legisla-
tion. These are unusual initiatives 
for a Republican to take, yet being · 
a war hero, few would dare to ques-
tion his loyalty to this country. 

Because of McCain's politics, 
Bush Jr. has been pushed to the 
forefront. He leads a group of 
moderate Republicans that

Wast. Policy Needs 
Impletnenbdlon 
Editor: 

As the Campus Waste 
Prevention and Recycling 
Coordinator here at UCSD I was 
thrilled to see the Guardian cov-
erage of the Green UCSD Project 
("Green UCSD Project Results in 
New Policy," Guardian. Jan. 28, 
1999). Your coverage of the 
Waste Prevention and Recycling 
Policy was right on including the 
issues with buying recycled con· 
tent. 

I would like to point out that 
the Waste Prevention & 
Recycling Policy was approved 
and distributed to campus depart· 

ments on March 20, 1997; after 
about six years and two different 
committees' negotiations and per-
sistence. 

The Waste Minimization 
Advisory Committee worked 
hard to get the policy passed in 
1997 and is looking forward to 
working with the affected cam-
pus departments to get the buy-
recycled component implement-
ed at UCSD. The petition circu-
lated by CaIPIRG's members of 
the Green UCSD project was 
instrumental in gelting the 
administration to review the pol-
icy and go back to the table to 
figure out ways of implementing 
aggressive buy-recycled pro-
grams. 

While the petition was key in 
getting the Waste Prevention and 
Recycling Policy reviewed. it did 
not result in a "new policy." Staff. 
faculty and students worked for a 
long time to get the policy 
passed; now the challenge is to 
get the whole policy implement-
ed.

All things considered, some c0n-
tinue to ask if Bush Jr. has any 
chance of defeating Gore. If Texas is 
any indication, Bush Jr. 's chances 
are positive. His approval rating is 
70 percent. The national spotlight is 
a much different story. Will the pe0-
ple of the United States view Bush 
Jr. as his father's son, feeding off his 
family name, or will they view him 
as his own man, tested and tried as 
governor, making his own strides 
toward the White House? 

Obviously, only time can answer 
these questions. With the volatility 
of American politics anything can 
happen. The Democrats seem set on 
accepting AI Gore as their nominee. 
Republicans are divided and jum-
bled, searching for their next torch-
bearer and perhaps finding one in 
Bush Jr. We can only wait and 
watch as he steps out from under his 
father's shadow and into the glaring 
eyes of the nation.

Committee Discussed Master Plan and Parking 
DEVELOPMENT: Snee says construction of two new parking garages on Gilman Drive and near North Parking will begin this July 
By Vincent Greenan! 
Senior Staff Writer 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Auxiliary Plant Services Jack Hug. 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Campus Planning Jeff Steindorf 
and Director of Parking and 
Transportation Services Greg Snee 
presented the UCSD Master Plan to 
the A.S. Executive Committee on 
Parking Tuesday night. The UCSD 
Master Plan outlines the academic 
and physical future of the universi-
ty. 

Revelle Junior Senator Casey 
Luskin - who chairs the commit-
tee - said lhat the master plan was 
presented so that people could edu-
cate themselves about the future of 
the university. 

"(A.S. President Joe Leventhal] 
and' wanted to have someone from 
the administration present the mas-
ter plan so that people who don't 
know anything about the master 
plan can know what the plans are 
for the school," Luskin said. "The 
presentation of the master plan was 
open to anyone in the school." 

Steindorf said that in the mid-
'80s the university had no detailed 
plans for future growth. 

"'n the mid-1980s, UCSD had 
neither the comprehensive academ-
ic vision nor a physical plan for the 
future," Steindorf said. 

As a result. Steindorf said that 
the university formed the master 
plan, which outlines future building 
projects, colleges and student 
enrollment. 

The master plan states that the 
optimal size for the university is 
27.500 students: comprised of 
20.000 undergraduates. 4.500 grad-
uate students and 3,000 graduate 
professional students. UCSD is 
scheduled to reach these totals in 
2010. 

While plans for a sixth college 
arc already underway. the master 
plan states that there may be as 
many as eight colleges in the 
future . The master plan states that 
Thurgood Marshall College and the 
relocated Eleanor Roosevelt 
College may each be split in half in 
order to allow for additional col-
leges. 

The master plan also states that 
50 percent of undergraduates 
should have on-campus housing. 
Steindorf said that UCSD will 
probably not achieve that goal. He 
added that UCSD currently 
exceeds other UC campuses in total 
number of students housed. 

The university also has plans for 
several additions to the physical 
setup of UCSD. State-funded pro-
jects include erecting a natural sci-
ences building, another engineering 
building, an addition to the bio-
medical library and a Roosevelt 
college administrative complex. 

New non-state funded projects 
include building a science research 
park. a student services building, 
expanding of the Price Center and 
creating a new art gallery. Not all of 
these projects have been approved, 
however.

Revelle Junior Senator and 
Chair of the A.S. Executive 

Committee on PniIC 
Snee also attended last week's 

A.S. Executive Commillee on 
Parking meeting, where he specifi-
cally outlined the future parking 
situation at UCSD. 

At the meeting, Snee said that 
the current parking problem is now 
very serious because all lots on 
campus are beginning to fill up dur-
ing peak periods. Snee added that 

winter quarter has historically been 
more difficult than other quarters 
because more people decide to 
drive to campus on rainy days. 

He also said that on a few occa-
sions this quarter, his staff has had 
to direct students to the Torrey 
Pines parking structure across 
North Torrey Pines Road when the 
north parking lots filled upl. 

Luskin agreed that the current 
parking situation is very serious. 

"We are on the verge of a park-
ing crisis," Luskin said. "It's going 
to get worse before it gets beller 
and it's already bad. This year, for 
the first time, every single student 
space has been taken up." 

Snee said that between fall and 
winter quarters, Parking and 
Transportation Services allocated 
additional spaces in Lots 70 I and 
702 in east parking and Lot 608 in 
the School of Medicine. He said 
that by fall quarter of 1999, there 
will be an additional surface lot 
east of the current east parking lots. 

Snee also said that construction 
is set to begin this July on two new 
parking structures - one along 
Gilman Drive near the credit union 
and the other on part of what is now 
North Parking. 

Snee said that the garage on 
Gilman Drive will contain one level 
below ground, four above ground 
and will also include parking 
spaces on the roof. He said that 
while the new structure will have 
871 spaces, the area will net only 
650 spaces because .urrent parking 

spaces will be lost in the construc-
tion process. 

Snee also said that students will 
soon be able to view the Gilman 
parking structure on the Internet. 

"They've built now full scale 
models of these ... and what we're 
going to do is take digital pictures 
of the full scale models and that 
will be on our web site hopefully 
within the next 10 days," Snee said. 
"You'll be able to click on that and 
see what the structure will actually 
look like relative to size." 

Snee said that the north parking 
structure will gross 970 spaces but 
will displace about 310. 

He also said that when Eleanor 
Roosevelt College moves to the 
north campus area, there will be a 
net loss of spaces in the nonh cam-
pus area. 

Snee also said that both new 
structures should be open by the 
fall of 2000. 

Snee said that the additional 
surface lot in the cast parking area 
will eventually contain an addition-
al 1,600 spaces, 700 of which 
should be open by fan of 1999. 
There are currently 1,000 spICes in 
east parking. 

Snee said that while !he univer-
sity has a large amount of undevel-
oped land in the north-cut pan of 
campus, that land will probably 
never be used for parting. 

"The [ecological) park has spe-
cific boundaries and it's probably

Barrell said that the committee is

Through ground lease, the UC-
owned land would be leased to a 
developer so that it could use its 
own funds to build and operate 
the complex. Because develop-
ment will take 'place on UC prop-
erty, however, standards such as a 
rent cap would be determined by 
the university. Ground lel4se 
would reduce much of the 
bureaucracy that must be con-

complex. This method is current-
ly used at UC Davis and is also 
being considered by both UC

master plan. One of the goals 
essentially is not to fully develop 
the campus, to always maintain a 
portion of the park" 

Snee said that because parking 
has been so cramped lately. the uni-
versity may look at alternate park-
ing policies such as a market-based 
system where students who were 
willing to pay more money would 
be able to park in better locations. 
Snee tlid that a similar proposal 
was rejected by students in a refer-
endum five years ago. 

Snee said that other ideas 
included a lottery system or poss.i-

we pursued [ground Ieasel, it's pos-
sible that a complex of unknown 
size right now could be ready by 
the fall of 200 I." 

Bond says he is in favor of the 
ground-lease method. 

"'think we should go ahead and

thing we can do to build housing

we'll be.glad we did it," Bond said. 

Barrett said that construction of

cialto students, considering the ris-
ing cost of living in La Jolla and 
adjacent areas. He also said that the 
success of the current market econ-
omy is causing rent in the area to 
rise. 

"Right now the vacancy rate in 
San Diego is less than 2 percent," 
Barrett said. ''The market has just 
dried up, in fact, because it's such a

- and they're gelling it."

Snee said he is currently putting

university to get a better sense of

Luskin said that he and his com-

veying students at random to get 
their opinions on the parking situa-
tion. 

"My vision for the committee is 
to do a lot of outreach to the stu-
dents through these surveys so we 
can see what their particular prob-
lems and concerns are," Luskin 
said.

not drink. It's just if you 're under-

Bond also said, however, that

tion and to identify solutions that 
may not be within the mainstream 
discussion but are in students' best 
interests nonetheless," Leventhal 
said. 

~venthal added that he hopes 
the committee will continue to 
exist after this council's term is 
over in the spring. 

Luskin agreed with Leventhal 
that the committee was designed to 
allow students to have a voice in 
parking issues. 

"My goal and objective is to 
have the students take a look at the 
parking situation from an all-
encompassing point of view," 
Luskin said. "We felt that this com-
mittee cQIIJd do its own research, 
talk to students and educate our-
selves so we can look at the entire 
situation as a whole and try to 
come up with a solution to lessen 
the parking crisis.'~

Francis Bacon s nightmarish paintings 
depict the horrors of post-World War II England 

]
le sunlit beaches of La Jolla are not 
the lirst choice for an exhibition of a 
dozen of the most brilliantly night-

marish paintings of the post-World War 
II era. Nevertheless, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, San Diego (MCA, in 
La Jolla) is currently exhibiting British 
artist Francis Bacon 's series of 1953 
studies of Diego Rodriguez de Silva y 
Velazquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X. 

The exhibit "Frances Bacon: The 

Papal Portraits of 1953," includes the 
eight paintings in the StudJ for Portrait 
series, Swdy after Velazquez 's Portrait 
of Pope Innocent X, Study after 
Velazquez I and II, and Sphinx I. 

The walls don't keep the sun and surf 
out half as much as the paintings do. 
Created in one busy summer in 1953. 
Study for Portraits /-VIII have never 
before been exhibited together because 
each is owned by a different pany.

The first of these eight paintings was 
originally created to be a portrait of 
Bacon's friend, art critic David 
Sylvester. Soon, however, familiar 
images from Bacon's repertoire made 
their way into the work, which itself 
evolved into another of Bacon's repre-
sentations of Pope Innocent X.

NOTES FROM THE 
UNDERGROUND 

SlaTTing: Man Dub Foo,ndaJian 
By U.o VllII.urrl 
Guardian Reporter 

The music press in England is both a 
well-established source of musical informa-
tion and a powerful force in the creation of 
the British music scene which it documents. 
Always ready to create phenomenon and 
invent or enlarge trends, British music mag-
azines - in particular weekly papers like 
New Musical Express and Melody Maker-
seem to have a huge influence on the musi.c 
tastes of their readers. 

At least every month a new band, or a 
music movement, becomes the so-called 
"next big thing." The britpop and 
drum'n'bass phenomenons were created in 
this fashion . 

Sometimes, though, trends work in a dif-
ferent way. There are bands that use their 
music, the message conveyed by it and their 
live shows to attract an audience. These 
bands are often ignored entirely by the 
media, but get bigger step by step over long 
periods of time . . ~. ,-.. . 

That scenario is what happened to Asian 
Dub Foundation, a coll~tive of musicians, 
rappers and OJs who firSt formed in 1993 in 
London as a sound system - spinning 
records at underground panies. They began 
to work their magic at Community Music, a 
London-based organization where bassist 
Doctor Das ran music and technology work-
shops for young people. 

Actually. the word 'community' is cen-
tral to defining what Asian Dub Foundation 
is all about: responsibility to music, Eng-
land's Asian communities, and education. 
This strong sense of community is the main 
theme in more than one of their songs. 

As the band said last year in an interview, 
''The emphasis is on the individual's respon-
sibility to the group. It challenges the nor-
mal roles in a band; for example in a normal 
band everyone thinks the drummer is 
responsible for time keeping and therefore 
they don't take a lot of responsibility for 
where they are in the music." 

Asian Dub Foundation sounds like an 
explosive blend of rock guitars, hip-hop, 
drum'n'bass and break beats. All of these 
styles are mixed with sounds coming from 
an Indian ethnic tradition which are revised 
and distorted through digital samplers. 

The UCSD Guardian HIATUS II 

The very center of the band's music per-
sonality, however, is dub. Dub as a state of 
mind, a rhythm perceived in all the songs. 

As the band itself proclaims, "Dub is the 
foundation, heavy bass and experimentation 
with low technology." 

As for the lyrics, Asian Dub Foundation 
does not avoid talking about real and con-
crete problems of today's society. The 
band's message is to stay aware and go 
beyond the typical points of view covered 
by mainstream media. 

One of their most famous tunes, titled ' 
"Free Satpal Ram," is about a British-Indian 
man now in prison because he killed a man 
after a fight . Asian Dub Foundation includes 
parts "not in the police report." They 
scream, "Satpal attacked in a restaurant hy 
racistslNow the brother's locked up on a 
lifetime basis/Convicted of murder but what 
was never mentioned/Self-de(ense was his 
only intention ( ... ) Time to join in the light 
backlBecause enough is enough!lFree Sat-
pal Ram!" 

Other songs, such as "Naxalite" and 
"Black White," both from the band's latest 
release Raft's Revenge, have become real 
hymns to freedom. 

Asian Dub Foundation loves to define 
their music as Asian Jungle Punk - an 
approach to different sounds that makes 
them compose music that goes far beyond 
old-fashioned genres. The group has an 
electronic altitude typical of the '90s in 
regard to mixing its music, but the violence 
of their lyrics is reminiscent of '70s punk 
bands. 

When somebody complained about the 
hand's violent lyrics Doctor Das said, "If 
you don't want me to express it through 
music I can go and beat someone up instead, 
but I'd much rather discuss issues." 

Looking at the band as only a politically 
and socially involved collective would be a 
mistake, however, since its excessive mix of 
beats is one of the most enjoyable music 
experiences available these days. This is 
especially true during live shows wKn Jhc;,., 
band completely transfers its energy to the'" 
audience. 

The front man is a great dancer, and the 
hip-hop and break-beat peculiarities of the 
band's sound aggressively create an excited 
environment. The audience really needs to 
dance to enter into the band's rhythm. 

Asian Dub Foundation have played all 
possible kinds of shows. They used to play 
in small underground communities until 
they became popular through world music 
festivals and rave parties all around Europe. 
This popularity allowed them to have world-
wide fans at a time when nearly nobody 
cared about them in England. More recently, 
they have impressively gained popularity in 
France. A lour with Primal Scream has 
cemented their success in England as well. 

Asian Dub Foundation are not yet a pop-
ular band in the United States. They are not 
played by any radio station in this area and 
their album, Raft's Revenge, was released in 
November without any particular success. 

However, the band did open for the 
Beastie Boys in their latest tour. Gaining 
some popularity, the Asian Dub Foundation 
community will be back soon, as they are 
planning a new U.S. tour for March and 
April of this year.

Black's exploration into what 's 

fun about making music continues 
in frallk black lind the catholics. 
Upon first listen. you think the 
album sounds terrible. The next 
thing you know, you're humming it 
in class. 

Black performs a w uple of 
hilarious experiments in this new 
disc, including the outrageously 
hickory and abo satanic tune "six 
six ty-s ix" and the roller waster 
opening of "all my ghosts." The 
middle three tracks, "dog gone," Hi 
gOlla move" and "i need peace" are 
classic Black songs that go from 
hard-rockin ' to his trademark fake. 
sorrowful wails and hack again. 

Again, this album. like Black 's 
last three, don ' t sound that good the 
first time around. Of course, his 
lyrics don't make any sense, but 
that 's all part of the fun. The patient 
listener will be rewarded, however, 
as thi s disc will quickly tum into a 
favorite .

Extinction Level Event is an 
assembly of head-nodding ~ats

little innovation from the last 
album, and merely exhibit a louder 
I:ry for novelty-indul:ed commer-

Busta does display his unique bul-
let-spitting delivery. Those whose 
hi phop tastes arc cnwmpassed. by 
and do not breach the MTV and 
mainstream radio I:ontingent may 
find this album appealing and the 
skits humorous. The single 
"Gimme Some More" is a rapid 
and simple rant with a soaring

-•••• 
In recent times the rule has been 

that for every high-budget, low-
quality new motion picture, there 
must be' an equally high-budget, 
low-quality accompanying album 
of music from and inspired by the 
motion picture. 

"SLC Punk" is the new film by 
independent director James 
Merendino about two young punk 
rockers living in Salt Lake City 
during the early I 980s. In stark 
contrast to the current high-budget, 
low-quality trend, "SLC Punk's" 
so.undtrack does not stink of Bill-
board's top-40 cash-cows, but 
instead oilers up selections from 
punk rock's legends. 

The "SLC Punk" soundtrack 
showcases the entire early punk 
spectrum, from the Dead 
Kennedys' tongue-in-cheek anthem 
"Kill the Poor" to Blondie's quasi-
disco groove "Dreaming." 

"SLC Punk'" soundtrack features 
The Stooges, Adam and the Ants, 
The Specials, The Velvet Under-
ground, The Exploited and The 
Ramones - enough to whet any-
one's punk rock whistle. 

As if being a who's who of punk 
icons weren't enough, tile "SLC 
Punk" soundtrack features Detroit 
ska/punk outfit The Suicide 
Machines, performing a previously 
unavailable cover of "I Never 
Promised You A Rose Garden." 
Above and beyond the shock of a 
punk remake of a country classic. 
the track features, of all things, an 
orchestral score backing the Sui-
cide Machines' usual genre-bend-
ing musical gangbang. 

"SLC Punk" is not the average 
big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. 
The soundtrack that accompanies it 
is not the typical piece of MTV 
filth. For big bangs and bad music, 
check out "Godzilla" or "Titanic." 
For a crash course in the best of 
early punk, look no further than 
SLC Plink.

., LIIIIIur -.w 
HllItUs EdItor 

Anyone who appRICiaIes indic 
rock, underground electronic: or 
urban music: undersIands the impor-
tance of small record labels. Large 
labels get everything - the publici-
ty, the airtime, the money - but not 
neceSsarily all the IaIeNcd musi-
cians. By the time an artist is played 
on M1V 10 trillion times. and by the 
time the IocaI record store ups the 
sale price for its own healthy profit, 
much of the magic of music is lost 

Cduc:tive_com. an extensive cus-
lom compilation CD website pr0-
nounced "sedtK.1ive," is the ally to 
those who love to explore music 
without the help of middlemen. The 
website offers a whole library of 
music the radio has missed - hip 
hop, alt-country, house, new wave, 
acid jazz, punk, lefttield, lo-fi. 
lounge, turntabilism and dream pop, 
just to name a few. And because it is 
all done through the Internet and 
real audio, you don't even have to 
get off your butt. It's a music won-
derland for the Jetson's era. 

The process'lo access the music 
is simple. At the internet URL 
address http://www.cductive.com/ 
ihe customer is greeted with a 
coiled snake icon, beyond which is 
a menu of various modem music 
genres. Free Real Audio software is 

available for compulers thai aren't 
already equipped and a shan bio on 
the 100+ labels is offered for those 
interested - including Jeuet, Om 
records, Kill Rock Stars, Delicious 
Vinyl, K Records, Ninja Tune. 
Cleopatra. Imsomnia Records, Ay-
daddy, Communique and Alterna-
tive Tentacles, just to name a few. 

The site was started in December 
1997 with originally only electroni-
ca. urban and dance tracks. The 
site's founders, Alan Manuel, John 
Rigos and Thomas Ryan, met while 
attending business school outside 
Paris in 1996. Manuel proposed 
fonning a custom-CD business; the 
idea was sparked by his entrepre-
neurism class. The planning ses-
sions took place in the Rex Club, a 
leading techno-music venue in 
Paris, and the trio set up shop in 
New York a year later. Today COuc-
tive sales continue to rise and every 
month the music seJectjon broadens. 

Basically, just like a mix tape, 
CDuctive allows customers to create 
a mix CD. The song catalogue can 
be searched by artist. title or genre, 
or for more help, a pre-selected 
compilation can be chosen. While 
listening to the sound samples, a 
running total lets you know how 
much time is still available on your 
disc. The CO holds up to 72 minutes 
of music and is shipped within 48 

hours of the order, with a secure 
server and guaranteed satisfaction. 

You can arrange the order of the 
IOIIgs and even personalize the CD 
coYer with your own title: '1'm The 
Coolest Kid on the Block Because I 
Have a Personalized CD of Rocking 
Music That is Usually Only Avail-
able in Specialized Music Stores" for 
example. (Actually, this might be 100 
long.) The price is more than reason-
able with the firs! song costing $4.99 
and all others only $.99 or $.69. 
Tracks taken from the company's 
promotional samplers are free, which 
also keeps down the cost. Payments 
are accepted on-line or via fax. 

There are a few drawbacks to 
shopping lhrough the internet. If you 
don't have much computer power, the 
search can take a long time. Not only 
does each music selection take a few 
seconds to download, but there arc so 
many songs to choose from that the 
search can be insatiable. And each of 
these selections are only a small 
splice of the original song so it may be 
hard to quickly discern your opinion. 

"We are very excited to be work-
ing with CDuctive," Slated Alistair 
Nicholson of London-based Ninja-
Tunc. '"There arc people around the 
world who love listening to new 
music but don't know how to begin to 
build their own collection. CDuctive 
is a great where these fans can SLart."

...... IIt: The arrogance and corruption of Velftzquez's Portrait 
of Pope Innocent X (above) is transformed by Bacon. 

BACON: 
Images resonate a 
terrified nihilism 
c ................. 10 
painting has been transmogrified 
into a nervous victim of a Europe 
recently ravaged by two world 
wars. Bacon's paintings resonate 
a tenified nihilism, combining 
the gestural confidence of his 
contemporary abstract expres-
sionists with a presaging of the 
ironic cultural quoting of pop 
artists that would occur a few 
years later. 

The real Pope Innocent X was 
the most powerful man in the 
Western world during the 17th 
century. The figure portrayed in 
Bacon 's paintings is lost in a 
world beyond his control, a world 
where, as Nietzsche said (and 
exhibition literature endlessly 
reminds t.he viewer), "God is 
dead." 

The eight paintings that make 
up the Study for Portrait series, 
the longest series in Bacon 's 
career, are set up in a single, 
eight-walled room. It is impossi-

ble to tell for sure whether the 
paintings are meant to represent 
several different Popes or one 
Pope in sequence, similar to a 
strip of film or a plale from Ead-
weard Muybridge's photography 
book, The Human Figure in 
Motion. 

Whatever the case, the sense 
of movement between the paint-
ings is undeniable and inioxicat-
ing. As the viewer turns around 
the room, the figure seems to look 
about nervously, touch his face, 
grin (in an image inspired by a 
photo of President Theodore Roo-
sevelt), open his mouth as if to 
speak or breathe, then scream and 
finally make a marginally 
obscene gesture at the viewer. 

In each of the Stlldy for Por-
trait paintings, the figure exisls 
in a space created by only a hand-
ful of straight, yellow lines. The 
paintings almost look as though 
they were painted on black velvet, 
echoing Bacon's love of untradi-
tional imagery. 

The only door in this room 
leads the viewer's eyes to Bacon's 
most famous work, Study after

PATH OF DACHAS 
Jordan ~ sci-fi fantasy novel continues saga 
IJMlchMla..t 
Guardian Reporter . 

On Oct. 20, Tor released the 
eighth book in The Wheel of Time, 
a series of fantasy novels by Robert 
Jordan. This book, The Path of 
Daggers, continues a story that 
began in 1990 with The Eye of the 
World. 

The series examines the time-
less battle between light and shad-
ow with a twist. The hero of light is 
prophesied to destroy the world 
and die, forcing the primary hero to 
reconcile what he wants to do with 
the duty he must perfonn, and the 
destiny he must face. 

The SUI:CCSS of this series is 
demonstrated by numerous web 
pages where fans debate the future 
of the series and details that have 
been left vague purposefully by the 
author. 

Jordan is able to evoke such a 
fan response by alluding to future 
events in the plot. Characters are 
continuously obtaining glimpses of 
the future. though typically in a 
highly symbolic manner. Pieces of 
the puzzle are spread throughout 
the series, leaving the reader to sift 
through the story to glean the 
details which give some hint as to 
what is coming. 

Another important feature of 
the series is the mutability of infor-
mation. Unless information is 
reported first-hand, its reliability is 
suspect. Incomplete infonnation of 
the past. present and future pro-
vides a fertile ground for debates 
among fans. 

The story draws the reader in 
emotionally as well. Jordan tells 
the story by point-of-view narra-
tives from the major players, which 
at times becomes somewhat over-
whelming. There are about a dozen 
principle characters through whose 
eyes the story is told, in addition to 
incidentall:haracters who tell small 
parts. However, these characters 
become individuals most readers 
care about and identify with, or 
develop strong opinions about, 
which makes the story that much 
more powerful. 

Perhaps the greatest praise for 
Jordan's work comes from the fre-
quency with which it is compared 

to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. 
However, this comparison is not 
fair to either author because their 
styles differ so dramatically. 
Tolkien's work was designed to be 
read aloud. It has the narrative 
quality of traditional story-telling. 
lordan's work is more modem, 
drawing instead on the heavy usage 
of internal monologues to tell the 
story, focusing as much upon the 
characters and how they react to 
each other and the events surround-
ing them as upon the events them-
selves. While both are like deli-
ciously sweet fruit. comparing Jor-
dan and Tolkien is like comparing 
apples and oranges. 

At first glance, Path leaves 
many readers somewhat puzzled, 
as it is not immediately obvious 
how much happens in the book. 
Most of the characters end the book 
not much further along their proph-
esied fates than they were at the 
beginning. A second look at the 
story reveals that a lot has actually 
happened - just without the exter-
nal effects typical of earlier books 
in the series. 

Path covers a regrouping of the 
forces of light and shadow, in 
addition to advancing several of 
the secondary plot threads. For 
those that enjoy stories that are to 
the point and end in a timely man-
ner, Path is probably not a particu-
larly good choice. For those that 
enjoy stories that one can savor 
and enjoy time and again, then this 
is probably a good book to check 
out.

BACON: 
Paintings keep the 
sun out of La Jolla 
C .... tI ......... _ 
Veldzquez's Portrait of ~ 1lIII0-
cent X, painted a few months 
before the Study for Portrait 
series. 

Innocent X combines the ele-
ments that would appear in the 
later series, highlighting Bacon's 
obsession with a still photograph 
of a nurse shot in the eye, taken 
from Sergei Eisenstein's silent 
film "Battleship Potemkin." 

The Pope is semi-translucent,. 
allowing the unprimed canvas to 
show through. Echoing this 
translucency is a slightly-opaque 
curtain, reminiscent of a TItian 
portrait that Velazquez's won: was 
referring to. 

Surrounding this well-known 
image are two Studies after 
Veltizquez from 1950 or earlier. 
These two paintings were thought 
lost and were only recently dis-
covered. These works offer a rare 
glimpse at the process Bacon went 
through to I:reate his masterful 
work. 

Also included in the exhibit is 
Sphinx I, a non-papal painting also 
from 1953. This piece serves as an 
iritroduction to the exhibit, and in 
terms of composition is more rep-
resentative of most of Bacon's cat-
alogue. 

Nevertheless, the focus of this 
exhibit is the nine papal paintings 
from 1953, and the exhibit is bril-
liantly crafted. The design of the 
room with the Study for Partrait 
series is extraordinary, allowing 
all eight images as well as Inno-
cent X to be seen at once. The 
effect of being sunounded by nine 
of Bacon's papal images is simply 
stunning.

BASEBALL: 
UCSD starts off season 
with a 2-1 record 
C." .tI .... ,.... 
two outs, Redlands' ninth and Iead-off hitters 
reached base on a walk and a single, respec-
tively. With a runner in scoring position and 
facing the heart of the lineup, Gherini con-
centrated to nail down the No. 2 hitter with a 
strikeout, thus maintaining UCSD's 4-1 cush-
ion over the opposition. 

In the fourth, with the contest tied at I-I, 
cleanup hitter Eric Thorpe began the three-
run inning with his first homerun of the sea-
son. Relief pitcher Eric Schramm followed 
with a base hit. UCSD then capitalized on a 
two-base error by the right fielder which gave 
the Tritons runners at second and third with 
no outs. 

TRITON TIDE: 
Free T-shirts at men's bas-
ketball game on Tuesday 
CO.llt nell".. ,... • 
Pack" at UC Davis. Group members will be 
present at sporting events, cheering the 
Tritons on and helping facilitate crowd-ori-
ented activities. Every undergraduate student 
is eligible to be a member of the Triton TIde. 

In celebration of Triton Tide's arrival. the 
group will be giving away T-shirts to the first 
1,000 students attending the final regular-sea-
son men's basketball game on Thesday, Feb. 
9. The wearers of these shirts will be inaugur-
al members of the TritOh Tide and will have 
access to a special section in RIMAC Arena. 

Gordon says he plans to create a good sup-
port base for the athletic learns here at UCSD

midtenns and other assorted worthless excuses. 
Nevertheless, the powerful combination of 
sports. food. and Samuel Adams proved to be 
too much and our house was full of people. 

By the way, how is this for a Super Bowl 
Sunday? Two of my toughest friends and I 
got up at 1:45 a.m. (mind you this was after 
one hell of a Winterfest extravaganza) and 
watched English Premier League soccer. The 
match was a great 1-0 victory for Arsenal 
over Chelsea. Then we went to the store and 
stocked up and proceeded to watch the big 
game. From there, we went to intramural 
bowling, which was absolutely beautiful. 

The point of all this is that people are not 

Later in the eighth,UCSD blasted the 
game wide open in the ,with. five-run explo-
sion. The team got rolling when Merrifield 
once again reached base with a base hit, fol-
lowing a walk by No. 9 hitter Howze. The 
next batter reached base on an error, setting 
the stage for the newly acquired transfer out-
fielder, Brian Terrell, who proceeded to clear 
all the bases with an RBI triple. He later came 
around on a passed ball. 

Later. reliever James Sanders shut down 
Redlands in the bottom of the ninth for an 11-
5 victory. 

The team expects prolific offensive sup-
port out of rookie shortstop Merrifield, who is 
leading the team with a .500 average through 
three games. Merrifield and Terrell are two 
new faces that will become more recogniz-
able in the lineup if UCSD is to fully utilize 
its stores of talent and return to the champi-
onship-caliber teams of past years. 

that will grow as the university moves up to 
Division D. 

"Our job as creators is to set up the struc-
ture of the organization and to get diverse and 
dynamic involvement from the UCSD cam-
pus and community," Gordon said. "Ideally, 
the Triton Tide will be sponsoring roughly 20 
to 30 games a year, ranging from basketball 
to water polo. These events will provide the 
campus and all five colleges the avenues to 
get out and support Triton athletics. I believe 
the Triton Tide will make a large impact to 
improve school spirit here at UCSD." 

School spirit will most certainly improve 
when the Triton Tide appears on the scene 
next Tuesday. There's no doubt that going to 
sporting events is fun and is a large pan of the. 
college experience. If the Triton Tide get their 
way, everyone at UCSD will experience the 
thrill of cheering loudly for the Triton teams. 

devoting their entire lives to their studies and 
staying away from the sun. It's a strange new 
concept, but "fun" is catching on at UCSD 
and I couldn't be happier. .. I-

0K, now I know many of you have a new 
problem: Now that you have discovered fun, 
what do you do about it? 

KEEP GOING TO GAMES! 
The more people go, the more fun the game 

is. Then more people are apt to want to go out 
after the games, which in tum makes the night 
life around here more ... that's right, fun! 

It's very simple. So, the next big game is 
next Tuesday night at 7 p.m. in RIMAC 
Arena. It's a basketball game and they're giv-
ing out more free stuff! This time there will 
be free '7riton Tide" T-shirts given to the first 
1,000 people. Under the normal circum-
stances in past years, any old person who 
walked in would be guaranteed a shirt.

That has to be the Chapman game on

I love being able to play competitive-

In a school this big where everyone's 
intelligent and just a number, it's nice to 
feel like I'm a part of something unique.

It's been great for our team. We've 
kind of been like a home-base for our 
team. It's been a positive atmosphere 
the whole season. Everyone [in the 
house] is mature enough to leave their 
problems on the court. For the rookies. 
it's good for them io see that we care 
about each other and want to be with

KILL: UCSD loses bid for consecutive victories with loss to BYU in RIMAC 
By BIll Burger 
Senior Staff Writer 

Though the analogy of David 
and Goliath has been overused in 
sports, it perfectly describes the 
UCSD men's volleyball match last 
Tuesday against Brigham Young 
University. While the Cougars 
were ranked third in the nation in 
Division I going into Tuesday, the 
Tritons were ranked second in 
Division Ill. BYU held a record of

played much better in 
game two than they did

senior Devon Jeffcoat 
and sophomore Zack

had seemed impenetra-

Seckington served tough all

Swinging into, ,Ninth 
PAR: UCSD starts off year with tough tournament in Bakersfield 

ayJohn~ 
Sports Editor 

Maybe it's the UCSD mentality, or maybe 
it's just masochism. Whatever it is. one thing 
is for sure: The UCSD golf team doesn 't like 
to make things easy for itself. 

While most teams would start 
their seasons with a scrimmage or 
a dual-match with a sub-par 
team, the Tritons' opening tour-
nament last Monday and 
Tuesday was a grueling 12-team 
match played on a tough course in 
chilly Bakersfield. 

The Tritons fared well against the other 
squads in the field. finishing in a respectable 
ninth place out of 12 schools. It was clear thal 
tournament host Cal State Bakersfield had 
home-course advantage as the team went on 
to win the tournament with a low total of 586. 
The Tritons were just 33 swings off pace, with 
a total of 619 strokes. 

UCSO's star junior James Donahoe said 
that the tournament was a good way to get the 
season started after the fall break. 

"It was a very good tournament on a tough 
course," Donahoe said. 

Donahoe also said that in the past the learn 
has opened its season against "crappy" 
schools, which gave it little idea about what to 
expect from future competition. By opening 
up with a high-caliber tournament, Donahoe 
said that the team now knows where it needs 
to be by season's end in order to compete 
nationally. 

The field was tough. and Donahoe defi-
nitely felt the course's wrath. He finished 26th 
amongst the 66 players in the tournament. 

with a two-day total of 153. Donahoe shot 9 
ove'r on the par 72 course. He was also 9 
strokes off the pace of Cal State San 
Bernadino's Sean Taeger, who won the open, 
shooting an even 144. 

Donahoe's 26th place finish was third 
best among his fellow teammates. 

Mall Cassarino was UCSD's 
top-finisher. Cassarino, who took 
last fall ofT, brought home a 5-
over-par 149, good for a sixth 

place fi ni sh overa II. 
"Mall Cassarino played really well 

in his first tournament in a year," Donahoe 
said. "He's II solid part of the team." 

Greg Johnson is another valuable clement 
to the Triton side. Johnson totaled lSI strokes 
over the two-day tournament, earning 15th 
place honors overall. 

Although these finishes were solid, 
Donahoe said that there is still room for 
improvement. An area that kept notoriously 
kept UGSD out of contention was its four and 
five spots. Donahoe guaranteed that this 
problem that has always plagued UCSD will 
be remedied by mid-season. 

"We have high hopes for the rest of the 
season because we have a lot of depth," 
Donahoe said. 'Those four and five problems 
will be fixed." 

The; Tritons will play in a series of dual-
matches over the next month. and are look ing 
forward to their first home toumament at 
Torrey Pines on March 5 and 6. 

"We're looking forward to our home tour-
nament," Donahoe said. "Other teams think 
our course is tough, and we like to hear that. 
We have high hopes for Nati.onals." 

Starting Ofr With a Bang 
ACE: UCSD demolishes Point Lorna in first match of the season . 
ay.uGordon 
Sports Editor 

Beginning a tennis match with an ace is 
the best way to start. The powerful service 
smash demoralizes the opponent and allows a 
player's confidence to swell. Once the first 
point is scored, the stage is set for a 
easy overall victory. 

This season, the UCSD 
women's tennis team started 
ofT with an ace of its own. In 
their first match of the year, 
Trilons annihilated Point Lorna 
Nazarene College 8-1 to begin the year 
with a 1-0 record. Head Coach Liz LaPlante's 
squad never let the Crusaders gain any confi-
dence of their own. 

"We've been practicing for a month, so it 
was great to finally play our first match." 
LaPlante said. 'Three of our top six players 
are new this year, and all the doubles paring:; 
are changed so it was exciting to see us dom-
inate like we did." 

UCSD's wOlACn swingers dominated the 
match from start to finish. Star sophomore 
Kirsten Olsen had a smooth ride in her No. I 
singles match, cruising to a 6-3, 6-1 victory. 
Veteran senior Maria Nguyen had an even 
easier time in her No. 2 match, winning 6-1, 
6-2. UCSO's freshman sensation Lyndsey 
Tadlock blanked her No. 3 opponent, 6-0, in 
the first set and let up only a little in a 6-3 sec-
ond-set victory. If Tadlock's performance 
against Point Lorna is any indication. she may 
be a future star player for the Tritons. 

"Lyndsey's a real aggressive player." 
LaPlante said. "She makes our team a lot beI-
ter." 

Already down 3 matches to 0, Point Lorna 

had little to look forward to because the No. 
3, 4 and 5 players for UCSD's squad showed 
no signs of letting up. 

Juniors Yen-Yen Ho and Becky Jones both 
performed brilliantly in their matches. Ho 

won 6-3, 6-2, while Jones recorded a 6-2, 
6-2 win. Freshman Rachelle Tsang 

probably had the most dominating 
win (or the Tritons, never 
losing a game to her 
Crusader opponent in a 6-0, 

6-0 rout. Freshman Carrie Gordon 
and sophomore Jamie Walker also won 

their matches, giving UCSD a perfect 
record in the singles part of the competition. 

During lhe doubles competition came 
UCSD's lone lost match, a hard-fought 9-7 
defeat for the No. I tearn of Olsen and 
Tadlock. The No. 2 squad of Nguyen and Ho 
won their match 8-2, with the duos of Jones 
and Tsang and Gordon and Walker also 
recording victories. 

Overall, the match was a great way to start 
the season for LaPlante's squad. With one win 
already under their belt, the Tritons are hun-
gry for more. UCSD continues its season with 
two more away mitches this weekend in 
Santa ~ruz against Sonoma State and UC 
SantaCruz. 

"Santa Cruz is stronger than last year, but 
our team is much stronger as well," LaPlante 
said. "I think we have a good chance against 
them. Sonoma Stale is Division U so we'll get 
a good idea what the competition will be like 
when we change divisions." 

That month of practice for LaPlante's team 
paid off against Point Lorna. Now the Tritons 
are looking to extend their great start tit their 
coming matches in Northern California.

Triton Fans: The 
Tide is Turning 

I told you so. 
I have been whining for over 

three years about how apathetic 
Triton fans arc. I did everything 
I could to make you sec the 
light. and apparently it 's linally 
starting to work. 

To this day, I cannot believe 
that 3.713 of you came out to 
"Save Dave." When I started 
working here. it was always my 
dream to see a UCSD sports 
game like that. Yeah, yeah. I 
know I'm getting a little misty, 
but I'm a senior and apparently 
in addition to seniorilis, we gel 
all friggin ' senti menIal. 

However cheesy il sounds. 
it 's true: ThaI game was one of 
my proudesl momenls al UCSD. 
I knew Ihe kids here weren'l all 
chained 10 Iheir damn O-chem 
books. I had a sneaking suspi-
cion Ihal some people here 
wanled 10 come oul from under 
Iheir rocks and have fun. And I 
knew if I kepI nagging, some of 
you might actually lislen 10 me. 

Now thaI you did, you guys 
probably all came 10 a very 
slrange discovery .. . 

I WAS RIGHT!! 
Parlying wilh your friends, 

Ihen going 10 Ihe game and 
screaming yourself hoarse. fol-
lowed by going 10 anolher party 
is preuy damn fun, isn ' l it? 
That 's whalI've been saying all 
along: These games are oppor-
lunilies to meel new people, 
watch some surprisingly good 
competilion and jusl lake a fun 
break from the rigors of school. 
Of course, you can choose your 
own adventure after Ihe game. 
bUI one of my favorile pastimes 
is 10 have a nice discussion 
aboul the game ... over a keg 
wilh hundreds of my closes I 
friends. 

Then Ihere was lasl week-
end. Lasl weekend showed me 
that the record-breaking Spirit 
Nighl performance might not be 
a nuke. To be honest kiddies, as 
proud as I was that we broke Ihe 
record. I had my suspicions thaI 
this might be a one-time thing. 
You morons have disappointed 
me so many times before Ihat I 
jusl couldn't help it.

Triton Tide to Debut Tuesday 
FREE: New student organization to give out free T-shirts at basketball game 
By Jake Gordon

Spi rits are rising here al UCSD. 
Where once Ihere was a dead social 
scene, new life has sprung up in the 
likely venue of athletics. In recent 
months, students have finally 
begun 10 show support for Trilon 
alhlelics. When 3.713 raucous fans 
showed up al RIMAC Arena to 
"Save Dave," il seemed thaI UCSD 
sports had reached a new level of 
acceptance. 

Now that Dave is safely off the 
roof and Ihe amazing basketball 
season is coming 10 an end. one 
new student organization is trying 
10 make sure sludent spirit contin-
ues. The Trilon Tide is dedicated to 

increasing school spiril Ihrough 
evenls associaled with UCSD alh-
letics. 

The results of the 1997 Quality 
of Campus Life Survey showed 
Ihat whi Ie sludents are satisfied 
with their educational experiences 
al UCSD, they felt that Iheir on-
campus social experiences have 
been disappoinling. In late 1998, 
Ihe A.S. Council created the posi-
lion of AS. direclor of athlelic rela-
lions to address Ihe need for coor-
dinated campus activities Ihal 
would boost student attendance at 
athletic evenlS and ultimately pro-
vide UCSD sludents with a beuer 
social experience. 

Senior Robert Gordon was 

appointed to the AS position and 
Ihe Triton Tide is a direct result of 
his efforts. 

"As director of athletic reIa-
lions, starting the Triton Tide has 
become a passion of mine," he 
said. "The preliminary response 
from students has been nothing but 
enlhusiasm and excilement toward 
making this group happen on cam-
pus. II makes me belilfve that 
UCSD has the potential to unleash 
lOIS of support for our athletic 
teams and to have a great time 
doing it. II 

The Triton Tide will be a spirit 
club much like the "Sixth Man" at 
Stanford University or the "Aggie

a 6-4 UCSD win. As for Hill, the 
sophomore has continued offen-
sively where he left off last season, 
hiuing .417. This number includes 
a whopping 9 RBis in the first three 
games. Last year, his .445 bauing 
average was the second highest in 
UCSD history. 

Following the weekend split 
with CSLA, the team traveled back 
down to La Jolla for its Division III 
home opener against the University 
of Redlands this Tuesday. 

The ace of the Triton pitching 
rotation, John Gherini, is coming 
off an injury-filled season, in which 
the starter remarkably managed to 
post a 1.83 ERA in the second half 
of the season. He turned in five and 
one-third solid innings in the open-
er and eamed a win in his first start 
of the season. 

Gherini averted potential danger 
in the top of the fifth when with
