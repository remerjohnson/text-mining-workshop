SANTA BARBARA - High-
ranking UC Santa Barbara 
officials appear to be examin-
ing the merits of a complaint, 
filed by a UCSB graduate 
student during Fall Quarter, 
that charges a professor with 
sexual assualt. In a memo 
dated Feb. 18, campus sexual 
harassment officer Paula ' 
Rudolph informed the student 
that her complaint was 
forwarded to Executive Vice 
ChancelIor Donald Crawford. 
Rudolph's action indicated 
that the professor's behavior 
may be a violation of the 
university's sexual harassment 
policy, according to the most 
recent campus policy guide-
lines. 

Council Defeats 
G.E. Resolution 
DA VIS - The ASUCD 
Executive Council voted 5-4 
to reject a resolution which 
would support a proposal to 
overhaul UC Davis' current 
general education require-
ment. However, the fate of 
the proposal - which calls 
for the addition of a two-
course diversity requirement 
- will be determined by the 
Academic Senate in the 
spring. 

Review Course 
Prompts UprO. 
SAN DIEGO - A former San 
Diego State teaching assistant 
has aroused the ire of some 
professors because of the way 
he conducts exam review 
sessions for students. Michael 
Scrivener's A+ Review 
program uses in-class notes 
taken by representatives, as 
well as exercises, quizzes and 
old exams available to 
students. SDSU professors 
have alleged that the advertis-
ing for the review sessions is 
misleading and that the notes 
provided during the review 
sessions are inaccurate.

Use of Social Security as ID megal 
INFORMAnON: A.S. 
lawyer says university 
cannot distribute social 
security numbers 
By Alexander Thle.en 
Staff Writer 

In a fax to AS. President Carla 
Tesale. AS. attorney John Francis 
explained the conditions under 
which distribution of social secu-
rity numbers is illegal. Tesak for-
warded the fax to the registrar and 
the UC General Council on Friday 
as part of a campaign to pressure 
the university into changing the 
system. 

after it is distributed to other de-
partments on campus. A common 
practice of academic departments 
is posting grades according to so-
cial security numbers, which is 
illegal under a federal privacy act. 
The registrar is legally liable for 
suits arising from this violation. 

The random nine-digit number 
would be cross-referenced with the 
student's social security number, 
but only when required by law. 

At the time of the proposal, the 
AS. suggested that it might subsi-
dize the cost of the transition if the 
registrar were unable to fund the 
switch independently. But after 
receiving legal counsel from 
Francis, the AS. said it would 
repeal its offer if the registrar were 
required by law to change the sys-

The use of social security num'-
bers by certain departments of the 
university is illegal for record-

keep~ng purposes, according to 
an attorney for the Associated Stu-
dents. 

The registrar may legally re-
quire student social security num-
bers for financial purposes, but 
use of the number becomes illegal 

Several weeks ago, the AS. ap-
proached the Registrar's Office with 
a proposa1 for a new student identi-
fication system in which random 
nine-<iigit numbers would be substi-
tuted for social security numbers. See SECURITY, Page 2

Testing Ban

RESEARCH: University .submits 
plan of correction to feds; NIH 
still wants documentation 
By Philip Michaela 
News Editor 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . 
announced on Thursday that it is dropping its 
week-old restrictions on UCSD's recruitment of 
new human subjects for clinical tests after the 
university submitted a plan for correcting flaws 
in the administrative testing proceedures. 

"We are grateful that the FDA responded so 
quickly to our plan for correction, and that they 
have recognized our commitment to ensuring 
the safety of patients enrolled in clinical trials at 
UCSD," said John Alksne, dean of the UCSD 
School of Medicine. 

The FDA slapped restrictions on UCSD early 
last week following a routine audit which re-
vealed incomplete record-keeping, missing docu-
mentation and unclear administrative procedures 
within the program. 

By lifting the restrictions, the FDA is allow-
ing the university to resume its recruitment of 
human subjects for FDA-related tests. The re-
strictions did not affect ongoing research.

Administrators Reject 
Housing Co-op Plan 
By'Alexander Th ....... 
Staff Writer 

The Associated Students' pro-' 
posal for an on-campus housing 
co-op will have to undergo sig-
nificant changes before the pro-

. gram can be implemented, a Hous-
ing and Dining Services adminis-
trator said. 

The Housing and 
Dining Services Of-
fice recently rejected 
the proposal by the 
A.S. for the co-op, 
citing concerns over 
a possible lack of stu-
dent interest and 
high cost. The op-
tion will not be of-
fered this year but 
will remain under 
consideration if the 
A.S. submits a revised proposal at 
a later date. 

"The problem we had was that 
the proposal we put forward was 
not feasible . [Housing and Din-
ing Services] would be losing 
too much money," said A.S. Ex-
ecutive Advocate for Housing 
Silvia Sfiligoi, author of the pro-
posal. 

The housing was to be made 
available at two of Revelle 
College's "mud hut" residence halls 
at a significant reduction in cost to 
students. Early rent estimates were 
close to $370 per month including 
a meal plan, considerably less than 
the current $600 per month. 

But Housing and Dining 
Service' s administrators had seri-
ous concerns about sufficient stu-
dent interest in the co-op program. 
In addition, Director of Housing 
and Dining Services Larry Barrett 
said was concerned about the 
proper maintenance and sanitation 
of the bathroom areas. 

In the proposal , housekeeping 
and groundwork services for the 
co-op buildings would be per-
formed by the student tenants, cut-

SECURITY: 
ContInued from page 1 
tern. 

Registrar Sally Hickok said she 
did not believe the law applied 
directly to UCSD's situation, but 
that the Registrar's Office had al-
ready begun estimating the cost of 
a switch as early as Fall Quarter of 
1995. 

"We are working with theAsso-
ciated Students and accommodat-
ing their request if we can, if it's 
financially feasible and if it doesn ' t 
create major complications for the 
various offices on campus," Hickok 
said. 

Students have always been able 
to change their identification 
numbers, though fewer than a 

ting costs by eliminating the need 
for university-employed mainte-
nance crews. R.A. services would 
also be unavailable in the co-op 
buildings. 

"] wasn't sure how good a job 
would be done on [the cleaning] 
based on the type of chemicals 

that have to be 
used. If you don't 
use them right, 
they. could be 
dangerous. You 
can ' t just go in 
there with Ajax or 
bleach," Barrett 
said. 

The proposed 
co-op would also 
require the instal-
lation of new el-
evators in the 

buildings to allow accessibility to 
disabled students. According to 
the American Disability Act, pro-
grams such as the housing co-op 
must be made available to all stu-
dents. 

"Anytime you offer a program, 
it has to be a<;cessible to every-
body. I fully support and believe 
in that," Barrett said. 

In an attempt to retain more 
residents, Housing and Dining 
Services has begun creating pro-
grams that are more financially 
appealing to students. 

One of the recent changes al-
}ows residence hall students to bu y 
an all-points plan instead of the 
traditionally required meal-plan. 
The "Early Bird Special," which 
would have allowed students to 
live on campus next year at this 
year's price rates, was also offered 
to persl!ade students to remain on-
campus. 

Although the co-op proposal 
was turned down, revisions will 
most likely be made, and the pro-
posal resubmitted. " It was a really 
simple proposal that was meant to 
be worked out," Sfiligoi said. 

dozen have ever done so. The 
only cost involved for the student 
is the purchase of a new identifi-
cation card. "The option for stu-
dents coming in and asking for 
system-assigned numbers is there, 
and it has always been there," 
Hickok said. 

According to A.S. Director of 
Development Wally Lockwood, 
the switch to a new identification 
number should be relatively easy. 
"We know it would work because 
international students have a ran-
dom number," he said. 

UCSD is the only UC campus 
with a completely integrated so-
cial security identification system 
in which all identification is done 
using a student's social security 
number.

Flill Senate Rejec~ Lee as Regent LIGHTS & SIRENS 
By Karen Walsh 
Staff Writer 

The California State Senate on 
Thursday rejected the appointment 
of Lester Lee to the University of 
California Board of Regents, mak-
ing the Chinese American the only 
regent since 1883 to fail to win 
approval. 

The Senate action followed 
Monday 's vote by the Senate Rules 
Committee to reject Lee as a can-
didate. 

Lee joins Leland Stanford as 
the only appointee to the Board of 

Regents ever rejected by the Sen-
ate. 

Lee, a Sunnyvale businessman, 
was appointed to the Board of 
Regents in 1993 by Gov. Wilson. 
Another recent Wilson appointee, 
Ward Connerly, was confirmed 
by the Senate. 

During his brief tenure on the 
board, Lee often voted in favor of 
the UC Office of the President's 
proposals, a record which many 
observers pointed to as his undo-
ing. Lee favored fee increases for 
students and pay cuts for faculty 

and staff last year, while voting 
for merit increases for high-level 
executives in the university this 
year. 

On Friday, a spokesman in the 
governor's press office reiterated 
Wilson' s support for Lee. 

State Senator Tom Hayden, 
who is running for governor, has 
long been an outspoken critic of 
Lee. "This action should be a 
message to the university to end 
its policy of rewarding adminis-
trators while relentlessly raising 
fees for its students," Hayden said.

FDA: UCSD still

Continued from page 1 
in great detaii on how we intend to 
follow policies and procedures," 
said Director of Health Science 
Communications Leslie Franz. 

According to Franz, the uni-
versity will create an ad hoc com-
mittee to morfitor the corrections. 

The membership of the Human 
Subject Committee, the 12-mem-
ber board which oversees all test-
ing involving human subjects at 
UCSD, will also be expanded. 

"We feel that the steps we have 
taken to strengthen our human 
subjects' administrative functions 
represent only the start of our con-
tinuous efforts to have the high-
est-quality program across the 
board," A1ksne said. 

" It really just clarifies in great 

detaii, in writing, the policies and 
procedures of the Human Subject 
Committee," Franz added. 

The National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), which also ex-
pressed concern over UCSD 's 
record-keeping, indicated that it 
too is satisfied with UCSD's re-
sponse to the FDA. 

However, the university has not

COMMENTARIES: HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA 

OME on THE THEET5 
More than anything else, the homeless need to be given autonomy and power over their lives 

By Daniel J. Hurst 
Staff Writer 

Twenty-one months ago, I moved into a house 
in Pacific Beach with 14 other friends. Every 
other week a small news periodical called The 
Beach News landed on our porch. Inside, the 
magazine glorified the drunken, affluent debauch· 
ery that ran from P.B. to O.B. The first issue that 
arrived included a front·page poll of local resi-
dents that asked, "Will the removal of the recy-
cling center inJhe Vons parking lot on Garnet at 
Ingraham help with the homeless problem?" A 
majority said yes. 

Somehow the city worked out a deal with the 
State Division of Recycling. Despite the Cali-

Whenever the image of the "homeless" is 
fired my way I immediately think of my uncle. 
He carne from ClJula Vista, the ooIy son in a 
family broken by divorce. Despite a middIe-
class upbringing and two loving parents, he 
somehow stumbled into the hazy nightmare of 
drugs. 

He lived on the streets of Pacific, Mission 
and Ocean Beach during most of the Ronald 
McReagan years. When neo-nazi skaters took 
over the Mission Bay Park area in 1987, he lived 
in a tree until he saved enough money &om his 
monthly Naval disability checks to buy a truck. 
To survive, he scored hamburgers from 
dumpsters behind the McDonald's on Grand 
Ave and made friends with the owners of Slash 
'n' Records and several alternative clothing 

stores in Mission Beach. He went through drug 
rehab and halfway houses, AIooholics Anony-
mous and psychotherapy. And now, nearly 30 
years later, he's clean. He is the portrait of a 
success story - he won the street-pel'5Oll lot-
tery. 

The homeless will not go away if you get rid 
of the places where they redeem their aluminum 
cans. City officials eliminated a recycling center 
at Gamet and Mission Blvd. four years ago and 
it has changed nothing. San Diego will always 
have a homeless population. AsIc any homeless 
person in San Diego why he's here and he won't 
tell you it's because of the Padres or Roger 
Hedgecodc or the Casbah. San Diego has good 
weather. 

Most of the politicians in San Diego act like 
dentists scraping plaque off of teeth when it 
comes to homeless issues. But politicians don't 
deserve all the blame for this. The way the 
political structure is organized makes it impos-
sible for politicians not to wind up on both the 
NIMBY's ("Not In My Back Yardj IDd home-
less advocate's shit lists. Even the authorities 
who don't bold the view that "if we terrorize the 
homeless, they'll just go away," still see 
homelessness IS distasteful. 

Case in point. Twenty montha ago, former 
·Councilman Jim Hartley drafted a reaolution 
wbicb would have declared a "homeless aisis" 
in San Diego. The dcdaration of a homeless 
crisis would have immediately set in motion 
plans to erect alent city, much like the one in Las 
Vegas, for the homeless to inhabit The resolu-
tion was defeated six to one. Instead, a "task 
force" was created to figure out how to deal with 
the problem. 

However, a large group of homeless took 
matters into their own hands IDd built their own 
tent city in Balboa Park. The city drew strong 

criticism from people in the neighborhood as 
well as the businesses imide the park. Yetforsix 
weeks, it remained. 

Tentcities allow the disenfranchised to regain 
power over their lives. Those living within the 
tent city at Balboa Park had to deal with all the 
issues of building a conununity from the ground 
up. Unfortunately, the tent city also became the 
target of attacks by other homeless, who saw it as 
an easy place to pick up valuables. At the end of 
the sixth week, the police department, acting on 
orders from the San Diego City Council, man:bed 
in and forcefully tore the tent city down. 

Meanwhile, Councilman Hartley aDd his 
homeless tas1t force bad drafted three pieces of 
legislation. The first asked for an increase in 
funding so that the gym at Balboa Park could 
remain open for the homeless to sleep in during 
the winter. This passed tIuough the council 
unanimously. The second asked for the city 
council to narrow down a list of proposed sites 
for a fullR tent city (one of which was in a La 
Jolla canyon~ This proposal was heavily criti-
cized by the pubtic and died in utero. The third 
piece of legislation was for a "homeless 001II-
pound, "whicbincluded laaJemilillly4ylecabia 
tenls surrounded by a 100Coot-hip, barbed-
wile, chain-link fence. The police would guard 
ils sole entrance. 

Fortunately, Hartley's third proposal was 
defeated - the compound would be too aJIIly. 
The eerie part is that Hartley, the "CNAder" for 
the homeless, had essentially asked for the cre-
ation of a voluntary internment camp. Though 
living in center city may be hell, Hartley's 
compound would have certainly been much 
worse.

COMMENTARY: Judged by people who think that high sales are equivalent to high quality, the Grammies consistantly 
. honor some of the world's worst musicians 

DAVID 

snOUJ 

Year in and year 
out, the Grammy 
Awards provetobe the 
most pathetic display 
of musical schlock 
ever known to man-
kind I make this bold 
statement beca~ I 
know I'm not the only 
one to notice this 
yearly adulteration of 
good taste. What is it 
about thcse awards that 
make them so aston-
ishingly bad? 

The Grammies 
awardsbarneless schmalz so often that it is easy 
to forget that they have, in the past, actually 
given awards to worthy music. I was surprised 
to find out that the Beatles won the award for 
best album in 1967 with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely 
Hf!Qrts Club Band. U2, if you will remember, 
also won best album with TheJ0shu4 Tree. Of 
course, these two releases were also phenom-
enal sellers. 

But the miscarriages of musical justice are so 
much more memorable. Let's start with this 
year. TheBodyglllll'tl! Are they serious? You're 
telling me that out of all the ingenious music put 
out last year by the collective talent of the world, 
the single best musical effort was a crappy 
soundtrack to a crappy movie? 

1 first became interested in the Grarnmies 
when they announced a new category. for hard 
rock. I think it was called "hard rockJheavy 
metal." Whatever. What I remember is that with 
nominations like Jane's Addiction and Metallica, 
the award went to, yes, Jethro Tull. This was 
when my loathing of the Grammies began. 

That year had some other unforgettable re-

-

suits. Song of the year was 
"Roll With It Baby" by Steve 
Winwood. And who can for-
get the selectioos of the years 
since? Milli Vanilli as best 
new artist. Natalie Cole for 
her gravely morbid duet with 
dad. When they added a rap 
category, the original intel-
Iedual of rap, Public Enemy, 
was beaten by OJ Jazzy Jeff 
and the Fresh Prince. Perhaps 
the judges preferred lyrics 
liIte, "Parenls just don't un-
derstand" to "Farrakahn's a 
prophet ... " 

Though I'm not prepared 
to comment on the winners 
for Best Polka or Best G0s-
pel Rock because of my lack 
offamiliarity with these types 
of music, I assume that die-
hard polka fam are reeling 
with anger over the results. 

The winners in the cat-
egories in which I do have an 
interest, such as hard rock 
and alternative, were, of 
course, tota1 jokes. U2 as best 
alternative act? U2 deserves

ried for her fullR. Past win-
ners of Best New Artist have 
included such phenomenal 
successes as Christopher 
Cross and Milli Vanilli. 

The Grammies have the 
distinction of making all 
other awards shows IooIt sen-
sible by comparison. People 
may disagree with some se-
lections andomissioos in the 
Academy Awards, but at 
least the Movie of the Year is 
usually a film that most 
would agree is a good one. 
Not so with the Grammies. 
Many of us would argue that 
The Bodyguard is actually a 
very bad atbum. 

At least with the Oscar 
selections, it appears that the 
judges all share a basic love 
for motion pictures. Perhaps 
they have childhood memo-
ries linked to particular mov-
ies. Perhaps their emotions 
run deep when they think of a 
certain scene. They seem to 
vote for the movies that they 
feel represent the highest ac-

to win the Least Alternative category. 
Aerosmith's "Livin' on the Edge" is one of the 
year's worst songs. I suppose that promising 
acts like Smashing PwnpkiM will finally win 
awards when they become old and untalented 
like Aerosmith.

And how about the Best New Artist category.

But the people who judge the Grammies are 
different. They are not like you or I. They are 
said to be people connected to the creative 
production of sound recordings in the music 
industry, but 1 suspect thaI they are just a bunch 
of record executives. They have no musical taste 
of their own. They are all obese men who prefer 
Perry Como and the polka, but know they won't 
make any money off it. They really can't tell the 

difference between Whitney Houston and 
Aerosmith. 

They do have a strong emotional oonncaion 
to music. However, this CODDeCtion runs from 
the music, through their wallet and into their 
hearts. Their hearts go aflutter when they re-
memberamulti-platinumalbum.1tisonly natu-
ral that they would associate mass success with 
good music. To them, an album with guaranteed 
sales of over a million, like anything from U2, is 
good music. 

frnagine if the judges for the Grammies 
voted for the Oscars. You can be sure that the 
results would be different. Best Director -
Steven Speilberg for his epic wort onJIU'GSSic 
Parle. Best Actor - that whale in Free Willy. 
And, of course, the Best Actress would be 
Whitney Houston for her moving performance 
in The Bodyguard. 

There really is no good award show for 
music of any kind. The problem may be in the 
judging. Record execs are going to like totally 
different music than critics, and critics are going 
to like c;lifferent music than your average CD-
buying punk. 

But the real problem could be that music is 
too individual and emotional an art form to 
warrant any kind of award. No one will ever be 
totally satisfied with any music award because 
some of their favorite songs will invariably lose. 
And when people feel that their taste in music 
has been offended, they get angry and write 
long, rambling, biased articles about how unsat-
isfied they were with the awards. 

At least the Grammies add something to the 
world of music. If people simply listened to what 
they liked and didn't worry about awards, the 
music world would lose some controversy and 
passion. It also provides yearly comedy material 
for music lovers everywhere to laugh about.

A.S. COUNCIL HAs FAILED' STUDENTS OF COLOR 
I feel compeUed to wrile some-

UCSD. I was at the Feb. 9 Associated 
Students (AS.) meeting when the 
cross-cuIturai cenlerproposal was pre-
sented, and I can tell you from my two 
hours at the debale that tbe A.S. is not 
as committed to multiculturalism as it 
says it is. 

The ignorance of the A.S. regard-
ing multicultural issues surprised me 
since it is a body which "addresses the 
needs of all students," and students of 
color, though not so apparent, are part 
of this university and our needs must 
be addressed. 

Thank you, AS., for providing the 
student body with a shopping shuttle 
and a 24-hour study lounge, but what 
about the crisis of retention and re-
cruitment of students of color on this 
campus? Well, A.S., you had your 
opportunity to show your "commit-
ment" to multiculturalism and you 
spit in its face.

People are tired of being hassled

been an opportune momenl,cspecially 
since some members ac:tuaIly did at-

lition meetings, to voice concerns re-
garding the proposal. 

The proposal for a cross-cuIturaI 
center does not intend to exclude any-
one, but does intend to specifically 
address the needs of students of color, 
be they academic, cultural or social. 
Such specificity is what -would be 
needed to begin to address the con-

especially Cllicanos. 

At the A.S. meeting, the debate 
over wbether or not to support the

Many of tbe groups that feed and aid 
the homeless have given up on ideas 
like rehabilitation or working to ere-
ale "free zones" like Balboa Park's 
tent city. Instead, they have been 
caught up in the cycle offeeding the 
homeless. The homeless need to be 
fed - don't get me wrong. Many of 
them, in tbe wake of the closures of 
mental hospitals and drug rehab cen-
ters during the McReagan years, will 
nevor be able to take control of their 
lives. However, others are quite ca-
pable, given the chance. 

Thankfully, unlike the supposedly 
"liberal" city of San Francisco, San 
Diego has been less forceful in its

This growing intolerance toward 
the homeless is illustrated by the ex-
plosion of harsb, anti-homeless city 
ordinances. In the notoriously liberal 
city of San Francisco, for example, 
Mayor Frank Jordan chriSlened "the 
matrix program," which mandated that 
people who feed tbe homeless must be 
licensed by the city (a long, hellisbly 
bureaucratic process). Other measures 
directed against the homeless include 
prohibiting"intent to lodge" and sleep-
ing in public, dawn-to-dusk park cur-
fews and an "anti-begging" ordinance 
(which was recently ruled unconstitu-

Yes A.S., you have cleared up 
"some of the misconceptions" regard-
ing the support of multicultural is-
sues, and most importantly, tbe 
coalition's proposal. I think you have 

attempts to harass "feeders. " San Fran-
cisco Mayor Jordan has created a bu-
reaucratic boomerang called "the 
matrix" to destroy homeless c:oaIi-
tions and support groups. This loop-
hole forces feeders in San Francisco 
to obtain city health and safety ap-
proval before they can feed the home-
less. 

Though San Diego has been less 
antagonistic to its feeders, those who 
care about the homelessshouldn'igrow 
content with this role. Similar legisla-
tion to Jordan's "matrix" is on the 
docket here. Soon enough, ~ Oty

in Seattle, downtown business owners 
have removed slats from nearby park 
benches so the homeless cannot sleep 
on them at night, the city has prohibited 
sitting on the sidewalk during business 
hours and there's even talk of requiring 
licenses for panhandling. 

These "get tough" approaches to 
"dealing"withthehomelesshavebeen 
repeated in cities across the United 
States. Like San Fiancisco, New York 
and Seattle, the cities of Atlanta, Oli-

constituency is fuU-beartcdlyaupport-
ing it- the organization who wrote 
the proposal, everyone who wrote a 
letter of support and everyone who 
signed the petition in support of the 
center. 

So, A.S., bow will you show your

8 NEWS The UCSD Guardia Moaday, Mareb 7, 1994 

For CSOS, ~ stwleDts acna OIImpt115 _ O!IJ~ pari of 
the job. Story by ]essiCIJ Y; Ping Fong, StllffWriter 

hen Fifth College student Jennifer 
Flaim was a freshman, she was 
almned by reports of the Clairemont 
Killer, a serial murderer who had 

killed five women In the Clairemont area near 

UCSD. Flaim knew that she had to confront her 
fear, so she looked into UCSD's Community Ser-
vice Officer (CSO) program. She liked what she 
saw, deciding to become a CSO. "I decided to be 
in control instead of being terrified,".she said. 

R evelleCollegejuniorMike Baranic also heard about the CSOs during his 
first year at UCSD. " I heard people 
talking about campus safety and I 
wanted to get involved. It's some-
thing different and it makes me 
feel good about myself," said 
Baranic, who applied to be a CSO 
at the end of his freshman year. 
Since then, Baranic has worked 
his way up through the program to 
be an Officer in Charge (01C). 
Along with Flaim, now a senior 
and also an OIC, he is responsible 
for dispatching escorts across cam-
pus, processing discrepancies and 
supervising other CSOs. 

"I know I have confidence in 
myself when I' m working as a 
CSO," Baranic said. 

CSOs like Baranic and Flaim 
are easy to spot. With their bright 
yellow jackets, walkie-talkies and 
lO-speeds, CSOs are a common 
sight, escorting students around 
campus late at night. The CSO 
program began nine years ago, 
when members of a fraternity 
started "Joe's Escort Service." 
Eventually, campus police took 
over supervision of the program. 

But escorting students is now 
only a small part of the job -
CSOs are often the eyes and ears 
of the UCSD Police Department. 

"The goal of the CSO program 
is to maintain the highest level of 
security for the UCSD campus," 
said Jason Aldrich, assistant coor-
dinator of the CSO Program. Al-
though CSOs work closely with 
the police, Aldrich said, they are 
not responsible for doing the work 
of an actual police officer. "A CSO 
is more for community safety. We 
stay away from actual confronta-
tion ," he said. 

The responsibilities of a CSO 
also include patrolling parking lots 
to ward off would-be car thieves 
and making sure that buildings are 
securely locked. Using their ra-

• dios, they can call for back-up, 
and UCSD police officers will 
arrive at acrime scene within min-
utes. Because their bikes allow 
them to move across campus 
quickly, CSOs are often the first to 
arrive at a trouble spot. 

"Any time there's a call orsitu-
ation, and you ' re the first re-
sponder, that ' s' scary. You don ' t 
know what that will entail. People 
could be conscious or unconscious. 
We 've had mental people, and 
people who 've been armed," Flaim 
said. 

But that's all in a day's work 
for a CSO.

CSO Program Coordinator

when he talks about how difficult 
it is to become a CSO. 

"This is a tough job to get,"

a bike. You're working for the 
police department. You're the first 
one to respond to emergency sui-
cide calls, fires, 1Jlotorcycle acci-
dents." 

Koran added that integrity and 
honesty are the most important 
qualities he looks for in would-be 
CSOs. "They have to be trustwor-
thy," he said. "Especially if they 
are the witness[es] of a crime." 

Koran also looks for applicants 
with good communication skills. 
"We just need to be sure that people 
can handle themselves. It's unfair 
to put them in those situations oth-
erwise. One of the standard ques-
tions we ask everyone is, 'Do you 
have any reservations about being 
alone day or night in an isolated 
area?' We want to make sure 
they're confident about what 
they ' re doing," Koran said. 

Koran, Aldrich and Sgt. Jeff 
Hutchison of the UCSD Police 
Department interview potential 
CSOS to see if they exhibit these 
qualities. "There'aalotofcompe-

tition, and we aren't able to inter-
view everybody. We don't sacri-
fice quality for quantity. If there 
are 100 people applying for only 
10 slots and not even 10 of those 
people are qualified, we won't fill 
up those 10 slots. You really have 
to be qualified, or you won't be 
hired," said Aldrich, a Revelle 
College senior. 

"The interviews are stressful 
because this is a stressful job," 
Flaim said. "I mean, when there's 
an emergency, all officers need to 
know how to respond. You need 
good judgment to be able to per-
form well under those situations." 

Once hired, CSOs are put 
through a rigorous training pr0-
cess. While the police do not re-
quire CSO applicants to have any 
previous knowledge of self-de-
rense, Flaim said that mOlt CSOs 
have some background in self-de-
fense before applying for the job. 
.............. 

New CSOS spend one weekend 
training eight hours a day. Train-

ing focuses on officer safety, CPR 
and first aid. Afterwards, the CSOS 
are then drilled on radio proce-
dures and on escorting ltudents. 

"Even though we went 
through 16 hours of training, it 
could easily have gone for an-
other day. A lot of the training 
just happens in the field when 
people are actually exposed to 
situations," Baranic said. 

"It sinks in a lot more than 
when you're just sitting there 
and being told something," he 
added. 

On his first night out, Baranic 
said he was excited, but nervous. 
"I was worried I'd make a mistake 
or didn't know everything yet," 
said Buanic. adding that CSO 
training is an ongoing process. 

"1be best way to learn is to get 
people out there. The weekend 
thing just lets your feet wet," he 
said. 

"You never ltop lumina," 
Aldrich a,reed. "That'. wbat 
mates It excitiDJ. It's lOIIlethina 

different every night. It's never 
routine, and you never know what 
to expect." 

Aldrich, who said he has al-
ways had an interest in law en-
forcement, first worked for four 
and a half years with the Sheriff 
Explorers, a program run by the 
Sheriffs Department, before he 
started school at UCSD. 

"My mom had a heart attack 
when she found out I was work-
ing with the Sheriff's Department. 
She was like, 'Mybabyl'" Aldrich 
said. 

Consequently, no one in his 
family was very surprised when 
Aldrich was hired as a Campus 
Protection Assistant (CPA), a sis-
ter program to the CSO program 
which handles security for various 
events and facilities. 

Flaim's family was more sur-
prised when she told them about 
her new job as a CSO. "My par-
ents laughed. They get a kick out 
of the fact that here's little Jen 
Flaim working for the police de-
partment, "Flaim said. "'They could 
joke around and say, 'My daugh-
ter is a cop.'" 

Flaim said that most people 
think CSOS have to be men who 
are built like bodyguards. "1 mean, 
I'm not exactly 6'4" or 6'S" or 
anything. Actually ,I'd rather have 
someone [as a CSO] who knows 
how to use a radio real well and 
who will be able to react in situa-
tions [more than someone who 
only looks physically intimidat-
ing)," she said. 

"11 was different coming into a 
police station atmosphere," Flaim 
continued. "There were a lot more 
regulations and expectations than 
I was used to. I was intimidated 
because I was only a freshman 
coming in, and it was a new job for 
me." 

On top of that, she said that she 
felt a degree of tension because 
there were so few females .work-
ing as CSOs at the time. "When I 
started, I could count all the fe-
male and prior female CSOS on 
one hand. There were under 10 
women total in the history of the 
program - past and present -
and that was in 1991," Flaim said. 

Although she believes that the 
number of females in the depart-
ment could still be higher, Flaim 
said that the ratio between males 
and females has improved signifi-
cantly. Out of the 35 total CSOS, 
the program cummtly employs 10 
women. 

0. .... Jolt 
Most CSOS work two shifts per 

week, which adds up to about IS 
hours of work. Despite the long 
hours, Baranic said that he enjoys 
his job. "It gets you away from 
studyi ... you aet to ride out in the 
open air, you act to talk to people.

cso: UCSD 
students keep the 
campus safe 
Continued from peae 8 
around, it's sort of a stress reliever 
for me," he said. 

But Baranic said his job also 
has its fair share of difficulties. He ' 
has tobe on top of his performance 
each and every night. "When 
things happen, you tum on auto 
pilot and your training kicks in. 
You don ' t even think. You just 
talk on the radio, and you react," 
Baranic said. 

Baranic has also discovered that 
try as they might, CSOS can ' t be 
everywhere at once. "I 've learned 
that you have to prioritize and find 
what's most important," Baranic 
said. 

But it is clear thai the CSO 
program has made an impact on 
campus crime. Last year, Vl;'hen 
the budget crisis forced the police 
department to eliminate daytime 
CSO patrols of parking lots, car 
theft skyrocketed. Police estimated 
that IScars were stolen just during 
January of 1993. 

With the daytime patrols back 
in place this year, the number of 
car thefts has dropped dramati-
cally. 

"It makes you feel good as a 
eso because you actually see the 
results," Aldrich said. 

On a regular school night, there 
are usually between 35 to 60 calls 
for a CSO. On Sunday nights, the 
number may go up to 70. From the 
time that a student calls to request 
a CSO, it takes roughly five to 
seven minutes for the escort to 
arrive at any destination on cam-
pus. 

The campus is divided into six 
parts, and each CSO is generally in 
charge of one specific area, which 
gives them the opportunity to bet-
ter explore that part of the campus. 
Recently, the CSO program has 
worked out a service with Warren 
College in which it provides a van 
shuttle from East Parking to War-
ren College and the Matthews 
Apartment Complex . . 

Although he bel ieves the U CSD 
campus is relatively safe, Baranic 
said he wishes people walking 
alone would ask a passing CSO 10 
walk with them more often.

a nearby parking lot while keep-
ing an eye on the person who is 
walking alone. 

"The excuse I hear the most 
often [for people who walk alone] 
is that they don't like to wait [for 
the CSO to arrive]," Aldrich said.

Some students give CSOS a hard 
time because they are connected 
with law enforcement. At Muir 
College, for instance, Flaim said 
that people have thrown oranges 
and beer bottles at passing CSOs 
from the second floor. 

"They think we ' re the ones 
who'll ruin the keg party," Flaim 
said. "But we don't patrol the 
dorms looking for parties. I don ' t 
think it's anything we love to 
do." 

"People aren ' t educated in what 
we do," Koran said. "Like at events 
they see us as negative when we ' re 
only patrolling and protectingcars. 
You 'd think people would see us 
as a good thing."

the university is a major con-
tributor to the economic welfare 
of San Diego. 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
reiterated the importance of 
UCSD ' s role in San Diego's 
economy. 

" UCSD is an enthusiastic 
partner and leader in the eco-
nomic vitality and quality of life 
in the region. The relation be-
tween the university and its 
home is, in fact, symbiotic," 
Atkinson said. 

The university employs16,OOO 
staff and faculty who drew an 
annual payroll of $512 million, 
most of which was spent in the 
greater San Diego area. UCSD 
spent an additional S188.1 mil-
lion on construction last year, 
including the salaries of more 
than 2,700 full-time construction 
workers. UCSD also employed

The report notes that UCSD 

students spent an estimated $49 
million last year on off-campus 
housing, food, transportation and 
miscellaneous supplies and ser-
vices in the San Diego area. 

In addition, the university paid 
$115 million in federal taxes and 
$17 million in state taxes in fis-
cal 1993. 

The report discusses various 
partnerships between campus re-
search centers and business en-
terprises. Some of the institu-
tions mentioned are the San Di-
ego Supercomputer Center, the 
Center for Marine Biotechnol-
ogy and Biomedicine and the 
Graduate School oflntemational

(I RIPS). 

" UCSD is a renowned educa-
tional center, a major employer 
and creator of jobs, and a very 
successful recipient of research 
funding. As such, it is integral to 
the region 's economic, cultural 
and policy developm e nt, " 
Atkinson said.

"That was the turning point in 
the game," Marshall said. "I couldn't 
be happier with the crowd tonight. 
If they're not there, Kelly maltes 
those free throws and we are aut of 
it." 

Duringaquiclttimeout, Marshall 
set up a play designed to get Johnson 
the ball at the top right corner of the 
Itey. 

Johnson (16 points, four assists) 
found himself double-teamed and 
whipped the ball over to Lusain. 
With the defense converging on the 
senior and the clock ticking away, 
Lusain loolted to Allen near the free-
throw line. 

Although Allen made eye con-
tact , he couldn't make the cut to the 
hole and Lusain was forced to his 
left. 

Fortunately, Van Noy immedi-
ately caught Lusain 's bullet pass 
and sent up a soft IS-footer from the 
baseline. A hush fell over the crowd 
as Van Noy's jumper floated end-
lessly downward. 

"I was in shock when he let go of 
the ball," Lusain said. "I was just 
hoping it would faiL" 

When it did with only two sec-
onds remaining, UCSD stood on its 
heels and screamed its delight at the 
67-66 miracle. 

"I saw [Lusain) in trouble so I 
just kept moving. I didn ' t have time 
to think when I got the ball, I just 
shot it and prayed," Van Noy said. 

His prayers were answered when 
the shot dropped and Lusain (14 
points, five assists) snagged the 
Sage hens' inbound pass to secure 
the win. 

"The kid hit a nice shot," Pomona 
Head Coach Charles Katsiaficas 
said. "We controlled the game, but 
in the end UCSD just stepped it up a 
notch. [It is) a very good team." 

The Tritons have survived it all 
through this "rebuilding" season-
rashes of injuries, drastic offensive 
and defensive realignments, heart-
breakers and dream makers. 

" I've never figured out this 
team, "Lusain said. "Marshall could 
sit down for millions of hours and 
never put together another team like 
this one. At times, we were amaz-
ing." 

As the departing seniors Johnson, 
Lusain, Hantgin, Ressa and Van Noy 
took center stage in the waning min-
utes of the Cal Lu contest, San Di-
ego paid tribute to its storied past 
with a deafening standing ovation. 

In the end, on everyone ' s 
score~ard, the Tritons won.

NCAA: Tritons 
finish season 21-5 
ContInued from ,... 20 
key game-clinching basket with a 
three-point play lay-in offlhe glass_ 
Following the free throw, Cal Lu 
owned a 51-48 advantage. 

"You have to give them I lot of 
credit for scoring a buge basket like 
thlt with the crowd yelling like they 
were," Lusain said_ "lbat was a big-
time p!ay." 

"This whole yelr, there bas been 
one play that happened and we jus! 
fed off Ibat one play," auk said. 

The shift in momenlum was 
deadly obvious with the 1SO-plus 
Kingsmen fans taking full advan-
tage of the opportunity to hear their 
own voices. Cal Lutheran seized the 
moment and kicked it into over-
drive the rest of the way . 

Cal Lu erupted for a 10-0 run 
with a Tapp three pointer, two free 
tbrowsonan untimely Matt Minehan 

technical foul and another trey by 
the freshman Smith. 

"We pllyed pretty well up until 
balftime, but that 10-point burst re-
Illy hurt us." Marshall said. "We 
never recovered." 

UCSD narrowed the gap to five 
on two occasions, but could never 
tum the tide of Cal Lu's offensive 
onslaught. 

The Kingsmen were far too 
strong on the boards. snaring 20 
offensive rebounds to UCSD's 13, 
and presented a veritable clinic 
down the stretch on the free-throw 
line (canning 15-18 in the final five 
minutes). 

"Coach [Dunlop] knew every-
thing that they were going to do," 
auk said. "We were very well pre-
pared for them. Our game plan was 
to get it inside and everything was 
dropping for us." 

Tapp led all scorers with 23 
points, followed by Clark and 
Ridley's 20 points, six rebounds, 
and Sapwell's 19-point, II-rebound 
performance. 

"Tapp made some big three-
pointers when we really needed him 
to," Clark said. "He had a great 
game." 

Johnson,J\une(lOrebounds)and 
J\llen paced the Tritons with 15 
points apiece, and Hantgin (three 
assisls, three steals) and Lusain eacb 
poured in 13 points. 

" llhought we executed our game 
plan very well," Dunlap said. "We 
wanted to take it to them inside and 
keep Johnson from killing us from 
the outside. Clark. our best defender, 
did a great job shadowing [Johnson) 
and not lelting him gel loose. If he 
gets any sort of daylight be can lake 
over a game with his outside game." 

Marshall admitted that the Tri-

AIpeIra

LABOR 

The UCSD Guardian 

tons were badly bealen in the paint. 
"[J\une) had an outstanding game 

for us down low, but they beat us up 
on 'he boards," Marshall said. "We 
couldo't contain auk [in the paint), 
He has a way of slipping through the 
cracks with those long arms of bis." 

"You have to give them credit," 
Lusain said. "We were just beaten 
by a better team. We III gave it 110 
percent, but they were just too much 
for us." 

The Triton loss was especially 
tough to swallow considering 
UCSD's storybook victory over vis-
iting Pomona-Pitzer, 67-66, on 
Thursay night. 

.AJthough the Tritons were up by 
as many as 10 points. 25-15 at 10:56 
in the first half, Johnson's uncon-
scious three-poin' launching barrage 
could not prevent a valiant Sage hen 
comeback led by Pitzer's leading-
scorer and rebounder Bill Cover (20 
points, 10 rebounds). 

A San Diego dry spell sent 
Pomona into a point-scoring frenzy, 
and Brad Kirkpatrick's trey as the 
shot dock expired with 3:27 to play 
until the half tied the score at 34. 

Travis Greer'soffensive rebound 
and strong lay-in hoop in the lane 
put the Sagehens up 40-35 going 
into halftime. 

The second half wasn't much 
preltier for UCSD, which was forced 
to play catch-up the entire way. 
Pomona led by as many as eight on 
several occasions, but the Tritons 
never gave in. 

J\llen's skyline theatrics once 
again sparked a San Diego resur-
gence when Hanlgin found him 
streaking down court in transition. 
The capacity UCSD crowd roared 
to life a pretty bounce pass later 
when J\llen launched himself into a

Point cuard Rodney Lusaln IOU up for a shot .,alnst Pomona, 
riveting power slam that cut the

remaining. 

Despite the fact that Pitzer held 
the gap between six and eight points 
over the next four minutes, the 
UCSD crowd had gotlen a 'aste for 
blood and was screaming for more. 
H was not disappoinled. 

Lusain's three-pointer from the 

left side ran the score to 66-61 with 
3:23 to play. Unlike the Kingsmen, 
Pomona could not hit its free throws 
in the clutch. Wilh the Triton crowd 
going absolutely berzerk, Phil 
Kelly 's miss on the front end of a 
one-and-one and UCSD's subse-
quent rebound with 31 seconds on 
the clock gave UCSD new life.

After beginning the 1994 season 
with six consecutive 100les,the 
UCSD softball team finally captured 

a win on Sat-
. urday, defeat-
ing California 
Lutheran, 8-
5, in the first 
game of a 
double -
header. 

The Tri-
tons lost the 
second game, 
11-10, on a 
Regals ' score 
in the bottom 

half of the seventh inning, even 
though UCSO had previously led by 
seven runs. 

Before the trip to Cal Lutheran, 
UCSD (1-7) was dominated offen-
sively in its first six games. 

The Triton bats came alive on 

p r • • 

"We needed the win," UCSD 
Head Coach Patricia Gerckens said. 
"Nobody likes to loSe. We would 
have loved to have won two." 

Freshman Shannon Mounger 
picked up the victory in the first 
game, tossing a complete-game six-
hitler and helping her own cause by 
driving in a pair of runs. 

The Tritons put away the Regals 
with a six-run outburst in the third 
inning. 

Overall, nine different players 
collected hits for UCSD in the game. 

" It was a great all-out effort," 
Gerckenssaid. "We came out swing-
ing. The defense played really well." 

UCSD also took the field in game 
two of the twin bill with an offen-
sive mindset, scoring five times in 
the opening inning. 

The Tritons batted their way to 
an 8-) advantage before Cal 

Sprint. 
• n t • 

The game was tied at 10 entering 
the bottom half of the seventh in-
ning. The Regals bad runners on 
first and second when a clutch double 
brought home the winning run. 

Infielder Mari Rodriguez led the 
way for the Tritons with two hits 
and three RBis. Catcher Emily Rubin 
had three hits and first-baseman 
Kristin Schueler added two hits and 
two RBI. 

"On a positive note, we did • 
better job hitting than in the previ-
oussix games," Gerckens said. "We 
just have to realize that is the name 
of the game." 

Cal Lutheran was the Tritons' 
fi rst Division III opponent this sea-
son. UCSO'ssix losses carne against 
Division II and NAJA schools. 

"We are starting to gel," 
Gerckenssaid. "We just have to slay 
healthy. 1 haVel positive oudook on 
the rest of the season."

'lbeTriton men's volleyball team 
made a rare out-of-state trip to face 
fourth-ranked BYU last Thursday.

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS IS 

Two Tritons Head to Nationals 
NCAA BOUND: Castner, Monaghan early qualifiers 

Remember the old adage "divide 
and conquer?" The UCSD track and 
field team took it to heart last week-

end, as the Tri-
ton distance 
runners 

stormed the 
Cal-Poly 
Pomona 
Bronco Invita-
tional while the 
rest of the team 
charged into 
the Aztec Invi-

tationa� at San 
Diego State. 

The spoils of the team's out-
. standing overall performance in-
cluded qualifying two team mem-
bers for the NCAA Division III 
Track and Field Championships. 

peted in a field of world-caliber, as 
well as Division I and II, athletes. 

Notable finishers for the men 's 
squad were Matt Ringer (4:00.39) 
and Erick Goldman (4:04.13) in the 
IS00-meter race, taking sixth and 
seventh place, respectively. 

Tritons contributing to the 
women's track team's success in-
cluded Alexis Ruppanner (seventh 
place in the 400-meter run), 
Micheala Monahan (fifth in the 400-
meter hurdles), Susie Schmidt (sev-
enth in the 4OO-meter hurdles), and 
Robin Herskowitz (third in the 800-
meter run). 

"We fared very well generally," 
Salerno said. "This time, we did 
bener in the field than on the track." 

Kremser and 
Tyson Kerr re-
turning to the 
lineup, aftersit-
ting out with 
ankJe injuries. 

Dan TIIomauen ,left) and Cole Scarboro couldn't block BYU. 
Tara Monaghan qualified in the 

hammer throw with a mark of 138' 
11", taking first place overall at the 
Aztec Invitational and setting a new 
UCSD record. 

Field stars Terri Paulauskas(third 
in the long jump), Joanna Whitley 
(third in the hammer throw) and 
Andrea Rademacher (third in the 
javelin) put in solid effons for the 
women. 

In addition, 
senior outside hitter Lamson Lamm 
made his first appearance of the 
season. Lamm underwent rotator-
cuff surgery in July, which kept him 
out of action until Thursday night. 

Unfortunately for the Tritons, it 
was going to take a lot more than a 
mass emigration from the injured 
list to compete with the powerful 
squad from BYU. 

In the opening game, UCSD fell 

to the Cougars' second-string unit. 
"We didn't side-out well [in that 

first game)," Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said. "Our passing broke 
down as well." 

The Tritons made a statement of 
sorts in the second game, soaring to 
an 11-7 advantage before tbe BYU 
head coach went to the bench and 
re-entered his first stringers. UCSD 
quickJy succumbed to the Cougar 
starters, giving up eight straight 
points and the game as it got a dose 
of Division I power. 

"These guys are number four in 
the nation," Dannevik said. "They 
are legitimate. We played really well 

[in game two I, but they were just too 
strong." 

The Cougars finished the Tri-
tons off with a 15-1 game-three vic-
tory. "We were siding-out well in 
game three," Dannevik said. "We 
just couldn't put up any points." 

Despite the loss, the seasonal 
outlook remains optimistic for 
UCSD. The basketball team 's loss 
will be the volleyball team's gain as 
Matt Minnehan makes the transi-
tion from hoops to volleyball. 

Senior Chad Hinkle should also 
rejoin the team at the beginning of 
Spring Quarter for the completion 
of the season. 

"[Monaghan's) performance was 
definitely the highlight on the 
women's side," UCSD Head Coach 
Tony Salerno said. 

. One hundred miles to the north 
in Pomona, long-distance standout 
lJ. Castner also qualified in the 
10,OOO-meter run with a time of 
30:48.7, which set yet another new 
school record. 

At San Diego State, the UCSD 
short-distance runners often found 
themselves running side by side with 
01 ympic athletes. The Tritons com-

Similarly, Damian Coleman 
(fourth in the long jump), Doug 
Olander (third in the triple jump), 
Ian Cooke (fifth in the high jump), 
and Marc Sleenhof (third in the dis-
cus) chalked up points for the men's 
team. 

In Pomona, in addition to 
Castner's standout effort, numer-
ous other distance runners fared well 
under the ideal track conditions. 

Jane Zimmerman took ninth in 
the 3,OOO-meter run (11 :08.8), while 
Edgar Nidome and Mark Johnson 
finished ninth and 12th in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase with times of 
10:04.7 and 10:40.2, respectively.

Tritons Take Three in a Row 
MASTERS: UeSD avenges see loss, sweep twin bill over the Master's College 
By J.ff Praught 
Staff Writer 

After a disappointing second-
place finish in the Southern Califor-
nia College (SCC) Invitational, 

UCSD's 
baseball team 
had some 
soul-sea!ch-
ing to do if it 
was going to 
convince 
people that it 
was Division 
III top-10 ma-
terial. Con-
vincing they 
were, beating 
longtime 

nemesis SCC on Thursday and 
sweeping a doubleheader from the 
Master's College on Saturday. 

The Tritons have never had much 
success against the SCC Vanguards 
in Costa Mesa, and on Thursday 
they had to face a new obstacle -
starting pitcher I1a Borders, the only 
female in NCAA history to pitch a 
college baseball game. 

After the Vanguards took a 1-0 
lead in the second, UCSD mounted 
its best rally. Wilh one out, Jason 
Aguilar singled and stole second. 
Eric Quandt then doubled to left, 
scoring Aguilar. 

Bill McKnight was hit by a pitch, 
and one out later, Chris Miyake 

drove home two more runs with a 
double down the right field line, 
giving UCSD a 3-1 lead. . 

The Tritons picked up another 
run in the fourth when Dan O'Brien's 
hit-and-run triple scored Craig Birk, 
making the score 4-1. 

UCSD starter Mark Hartmann 
struggled throughout his stint and 
his wildness resulted in two runs in 
the bottom of the fourth. 

Kurt Luhrsen (2-0) came on in 
the fifth and pitched magnificently 
to earn the win. In five innings, he 
held SCC to one hit and no runs, 
while striking out four. 

Borders (2-1 , 71P, 4ER, 6H, 3K) 
was handed her first loss with the 
Tritons holding on for a 4-3 win. 

On Saturday, UCSO stole two 
wins from the Master's College. 

In the first game, Ryp,n Flanagan 
grabbed the spotlight, continuing 
his torrid pitching with a 2-0, com-
plete game shut out. 

In the bottom of the second, 
O'Brien reached on a two-out walk. 
Armando Sanchez followed with a 
base hit, and Aguilar singled home 
O'Brien to give UCSO a 1-0 lead. 

The only other run of the game 
was scored in the bottom of the 
third. AI DelFavero's sacrifice fly 
plated Miyake, who went 2-for-3 
with two stolen bases on the day. 

That was more than enough cush-
ion for Flanagan (3-1, 7lP, 2H, 6K), 

who has pitched 28 and 1/3 con-
secutive innings without yielding 
an earned run. 

Scoring was not a problem for 
either team in the second game. The 
two teams combined for 17 runs and 
26 hits in UCSO's 11-6 triumph. 

Already leading 2-1, the Tritons 
put four more runs on the board in 
the third inning. After DelFavero 
reached on an error, Ricky Ramirez 
singled him in. Birk followed with a 
base hit, and O'Brien cleared the 
bases with a three-run homerun. 

Triton starter Marc Abrams gave 
up runs in both the fifth and sixth 
iMings to bring the score to 6-4 in 
favor of UCSO. 

Abrams (1-1) gave up a lead-off 
single in the seventh, forcing Yates 
to summon lefty Steve Height from 
the bullpen. Height picked the run-
ner off first, but then allowed back-
to-back hits, taking the score to 6-5. 

But in the bottom of the eighth, 
the Tritons put the game away. 
Aguilar singled to open the inning, 
and Quandt reached on an attempted 
sacrifice. Bobby Arban singled to 
load the bases for Sanchez, who was 
nailed by a pitch, which brought 
Aguilar home. Miyake singled home 
the second run, and two runs later, 
UCSO had an 11-5 lead. 

Luhrsen pitched the final two 
innings of relief to earn his second 
save and preserve an 11-6 victory.

HEARTBREAKER: UCSD tallies miraculous 
comeback victory over Pomona-Pitzer, falls to 
West Regional top-seed Cal Lutheran 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

One look into the bloodshot and watery eyes of senior Erik 
Johnson last Saturday night said more than any in-depth 
interview could ever hope to reveal. 

After four long years of back-break-
ing practices, countless hours in the gym 
shooting thousands upon thousands of 
jump shots and working through hun-
dreds of possible defensive rotations, 
Johnson 's tour of duty came to an abrupt 
end after Saturday 's 95-81 loss to visit-
ing California Lutheran University in 
the second round of the NCAA Division 
III Men 's Basketball National Champi-
onships. 

It 's not as if third-seed UCSD (21 -5) 
was supposed to beat the west regional's 

top-ranked Kingsmen (25-2). After all, Cal Lu cruised to a 
100-79 triumph over the Tritons on Dec. 23 and captured its 
third-straight Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Con-
ference (SCIAC) title. 

They were even ranked as high as fifth in the nation earlier 
this season. For the Tritons, there would be no dishonor in 
falling to the Kingsmen - it was expected. 

But Johnson and fellow seniors Rodney Lusain, Nate 
Hantgin, Bryan Van Noy and Chris Ressa have survived on a 
different set of standards. 

"This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for us," UCSD 
Head Coach Tom Marshall said. "We have had one hell of a 
rebuilding year." 

They were supposed to lose to Division" Chapman Uni-
versity - UCSD beat them twice. They were supposed to be 
mutilated by Division I Northern Arizona University - it 
didn't happen. 

And with the Triton gym filled to the brim with over 1,300 
of the UCSD faithful, it was a safe bet to expect the unex-
pected . 
• From the opening tip-off, the Tritons fought like caged 

tigers with the defensive intensity to match, but Cal Lu 
nevertheless jumped on top early. Kingsman Damon Ridley's 
three-pointer at the 17:34 mark of the first half gave Cal Lu its 
first lead of the game at 5-3 . 

Lusain countered 19 seconds later with a lightning-quick 
slashing drive through the lane, banking in a soft four-footer 
to knot the score at five. 

But Ridley's rebound and subsequent coast-to-coast drive 
resulted in an off-center runner hitting nothing but the bottom 
of the net, giving Cal Lu a 9-7 advantage with 16:02 remaining 
in the half and sending the Kingsmen on one of their several 
offensive spurts. 

"They are a team that scores points in bunches," Head 
Coach Tom Marshall said. ") think we did a pretty good job of 
staying with them in the first half." 

Cal Lu's Derrick Clark. who ate up the Triton inside by 
collecting 16 points and six rebounds in the first half alone, 
ignited a 12-6 run over the next four minutes and had UCSD 
trailing 21-13 with 11:46 to go in the half.

Kahlll Allen'. thunderous dunk ...... Pomona-Pltzer sperleed. miraculous Trtton come-from.behIn win. 
But the senior leaders Johnson and Lusain were not about 

to let things get too far out of hand, sparking a Triton come-
back surge when Johnson drew an offensive foul against a 
charging Ridley. 

The Triton crowd roared its approval and UCSD responded 
by cutting the lead to two, 23-21, behind center Matt Aune's 
Olajuwonesque spin move in the lane at 9:31. 

Johnson's three-point bomb from the top left side of the key 
pulled the Tritons to within one, 27-26, at 6:55. After double 
technical fouls were assessed on Lusain and Cal Lu's Dave 
Ulloa, San Diego's nationally-ranked free throw percentage 
shooter Kahlil Allen sank both shots from the charity stripe to 
even the score at 28. 

However, as was the case all evening, when UCSD threat-
ened to make a run, the Kingsmen put a choke hold on its 
momentum. Cal Lu 's Jason Smith immediately drilled a three-
pointer from the left side to stifle the restless Triton crowd 
once again. 

Lusain answered with a stop-and-pop trey of his own with 
] :38 left in the half and gave UCSD a slim one-point lead by 
hitting two free throws at 1:13. But Paul Tapp's right-side 
baseline three followed by a quick full-c:ourt press steal and 
lay-in increased the Kingsmen advantage to 44-40. 

UCSD found itself trailing 46-42 at the end of the first half. 
"We weren't spectacu1ar defensively in the first half, but 

we stepped it up in the second," Cal Lu Head Coach Mike 
Dunlap said. 

And step up Cal Lu did, but not before UCSD made some 
noise of their own. 

The Triton contingent, led by the passing wizardry of 
Lusain and the athletic prowess of Allen, explocled in the 
opening minutes of the second balf. 

Lusain found Allen, who swished a pic:ture-perfect fiaaer

arena were deafening as Cal Lu screamed for a time out. 

But less than 20 seconds later, Sapwell coolly went to work 
at the other end on the vulnerable Triton middle, hitting the
