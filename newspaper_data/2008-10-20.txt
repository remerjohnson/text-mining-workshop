Minuteman’s Lecture Draws Crowd of Dissent

By Henry Becker
Contributing Writer

A coalition of nearly 100 UCSD 
students protested a lecture by anti-
immigration activist Jim Gilchrist Oct. 
16 at the UCSD Extension Complex. 
Gilchrist is the founder and ex-presi-
dent of the Minutemen Project, a con-
troversial civilian activist organization 
that patrols the Mexican border and 
tracks illegal immigrants.

Students from varying campus 
organizations marched hand-in-hand, 
chanted and expressed their opinions 
peacefully for the duration of the two-
hour lecture. 

“This country was founded by peo-
ple who look and speak differently — by 
immigrants,” ethnic studies graduate 
student José Fusté said at the protest. 
“[Gilchrist] says those who oppose 
[immigration laws] are anarchists, but 
we want a fair and balanced legislation 
to fix the immigration policy. No one 
wants to come to this country illegally.”

Many students marched with signs 

calling for Latino unity and rallied with 
calls of “We didn’t cross the border, the 
border crossed us!”

The Osher Lifelong Learning 
Institute invited Gilchrist to discuss “the 
uncertain consequences to the United 
States if immigration policies and laws 
are not enforced,” according to a pam-

phlet distributed at the event. 
“Our mission is the enforcement of 

the rule of law,” Gilchrist said. “We deal 
strictly with the immigration laws to 
protect American rights.”

Gilchrist considered the protestors, 
who chanted throughout his lecture, 
to be encroaching on his freedom of 

speech.
“If you ever want to have a dignified 

and respectful resolution to [immigra-
tion] problems, we can’t have those 
[demonstrators],” Gilchrist said. “Their 
goal was not for their rights, it was to

University, Alumni Reveal Price Center Guardian

By Joyce Yeh
Staff Writer

Members of the Sustainability 
Resource Collective proposed 
an add-on to the impending A.S. 
fee referendum last week to fund 
a Sustainability Resource Center, 
which would host additional sus-
tainability interns and various envi-
ronmental and social justice pro-
grams and events.

The center would be funded 
by an additional $2.34 per student 
per quarter, amounting to a yearly 
$85,400 budget to support an on-
campus office available to students 
interested in helping UCSD maintain 
a greener lifestyle. The center would 
showcase sustainability options for 
consumers and house a resource 
library along with a lounge and 
study spaces to encourage students 
to come together to make UCSD a 
greener and more tolerant place.

“The main goal [of the cen-
ter] is to foster an active culture 
of responsibility for sustainability 
on campus and in the community,” 
said June Reyes, a representative 
from the Social and Environmental 
Sustainability Committee. “This 
will be accomplished by an open 
space that serves the campus com-
munity by providing resources, 
support and space — connecting 
and empowering students, staff and 
faculty, which is integral in making 
real change.” 

According to Sustainability 
Coordinator Margaret Souder, the 
SRC will enhance UCSD’s sustain-
ability efforts by encouraging a com-
munal approach to environmental 
issues.  

“Part of what makes UC San 
Diego a leader in sustainability solu-
tions is our ability to effectively col-
laborate to find and implement solu-
tions that can be applied locally or 
beyond,” Souder said. “The SRC will 
be easy to access, making it simple to 
detour for a moment to learn about 
how to help, to share sustainable 
ideas or start the process for imple-
menting a project idea.” 

The concept for the resource cen-
ter was the brainchild of various 
environmentally concerned campus 
organizations, each interested in cre-
ating an open forum for students, 
faculty and staff helping UCSD 
become what project leaders hope 
will be a “living laboratory for sus-
tainable solutions.”

“It’s a next step in the direction 
toward a sustainable campus because 
it is an empowering space for the 
entire campus community,” Reyes 
said. “The sort of visibility it gives 
this topic is crucial because many

The Triton sculpture, cast in bronze and weighing 750 pounds, was included in the originial plans for the 
Price Center expansion. Funding for the project was derived from class gifts and University Centers.

By Deepak Seeni
Staff Writer

University officials, staff and stu-
dents, along with alumni and  mem-
bers of the surrounding communi-
ty, unveiled the campus’ new Triton 
sculpture on Oct. 16. Designed by 
alumna Manuelita Brown, the 750-
pound bronze sculpture was pro-
posed by the senior classes of 1998 
and 1999 and sits at the entrance to 
Price Center East. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue welcomed a crowd of 
500 at the event and introduced 
various speakers, including 1999 
graduate and former member of 
the UCSD men’s tennis team Ping 
Yeh, sculpture designer Brown and 
A.S. Vice President of Student Life 
Darryl Nousome. 

Yeh, who currently lives in 
Minneapolis, spearheaded the 
Triton statue as a class officer, 
describing his vision to both former 
classmates and current students at 
the unveiling as a “Triton-ization” 
of the campus. 

“Working [off ] the vision pre-
sented by Yeh and the classes 
of 1998 and 1999, collaboration 

between artist Manuelita Brown 
and the Triton sculpture committee 
was formed to create a symbol of 
unity and campus pride,” Nousome, 
who served on the committee as 
a student representative, said at 
the opening ceremony. “The statue 
is intended as something students 
could touch for good luck and pose 
next to for photographs. It is a 
landmark that students can come 
together around, unifying our cam-
pus.” 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
R. Ratcliff, the statue was initially 
funded by the senior-class gifts 
of 1998 and 1999 and received 
additional cash from University 
Centers. 

Brown, who has produced other 
works in the surrounding La Jolla 
area — including the dolphin sculp-
tures at Westfield Shoppingtown 
UTC — also spoke at the cer-
emony. 

“The statue’s design incorpo-
rates UCSD’s interpretation of the 
mythical god while meeting the 
university’s expectations of a cam-
pus symbol that would produce 
pride and unification,” Brown said 
at the ceremony. 

According to Brown, the sculp-
ture needed to be both interesting 
and timeless. 

The committee responsible for 
the planning of the statue told the 
artist that Triton “should look con-

Demonstrators outside the UCSD Extension Complex came prepared with signs expressing their disapproval of Minutemen founder Jim Gilchrist’s presence on 
campus Oct. 16. The controversial immigration activist was invited to speak at the extension by members of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.

Completed after nearly 
10 years of planning, 
campus officials present
Triton statue as unifying 
symbol of school pride.

fident, but not too menacing; he 
should be approachable and still be 
impressive.” 

The statue, in accordance with 
Greek mythology, portrays Triton, 
the official messenger of the deep, 
clutching a three-pronged trident 
and a conch shell, with jets of water 
shooting from its base.

“In mythology, the shell, when 
blown loudly, creates a sound so 
fearsome that the Triton’s rivals 
imagine it to be the roar of a mighty 
beast and take flight,” Brown said.

The unveiling ceremony was 
also attended by members of the 
university’s 23 intercollegiate ath-
letic programs and the UCSD pep 
band, which opened and closed the 
event with a selection of musical 
pieces.

deprive me of my rights. It’s easy for 
the adversary to label someone who 
disagrees with him a racist, murderer, 
embezzler or a criminal.”

However, Gilchrist noted extrem-
ism on both sides.

“In any issue we have the ultra left 
and ultra right, and what they rep-
resented was extreme,” Gilchrist said. 
“The ultra left is dangerous and ultra 
violent. However, on my side of the 
argument, there are the same prob-
lems.”

Many student protestors expressed 
disappointment with Osher — and 
with UCSD — for hosting Gilchrist as a 
speaker. Demonstrators were critical of 
the fact that that they were not allowed 
to enter the lecture hall, stating that 
the event failed to allow for a balanced 
discussion.

Jim Plant, program coordinator for 
the event, said that Gilchrist agreed to 
speak to Osher free of charge, and that 
the organization has always pursued a 
diverse variety of speakers for its lecture 
series.

“If [President George W.] Bush 
came, it would a good idea,” Plant said. 
“The more varied the better. We all 

want to be heard.”
The two-hour session was com-

posed of Gilchrist’s one-hour lecture, 
followed by a one-hour question-and-
answer period between Osher members 
and the speaker.

“There was a good flow of ideas 
there,” Plant said. “It was a very bal-
anced crowd.”

Gilchrist’s Web site for the 
Minutemen Project describes the con-
troversial organization as “operating 
within the law to enforce the law” and 

has drawn attention to the issue of 
immigration reform since its creation 
in 2005. Since then, the group has been 
involved in several violent protests with 
pro-immigration activists and has been 
featured on television news numerous 
times.

Gilchrist himself drew attention 
when the Minutemen Project board 
of directors fired him last year over 
allegations of fraud and fiscal misman-
agement. He has since filed suit against 
the organization and formed his own 
offshoot: Jim Gilchrist’s Minuteman 
Project. 

Osher member Dan Dinan 
described Gilchrist’s lecture as reliev-
ing. He said he entered prepared for 
a “volatile” speech and left feeling 
secure.

“After listening for 1.5 hours, I see 
[the Minutemen] are no threat,” Dinan 
said. “Gilchrist sounds like an ineffec-
tual, inarticulate member.”

Only once throughout the demon-
stration did protestors approach the 
front door of the lecture hall, where 
they were halted by a police line.

people do not know how to become 
involved or how to have their ques-
tions answered. Putting a space there 
to answer those questions, inspire 
people to become active, and a place 
where real live interactions can take 
place is invaluable and can stir up 
greater change.”

The SRC plans to sponsor pro-
grams aimed at raising awareness of 
human influences on the environment 
and providing students with proactive, 
green-friendly opportunities. 

Planned programs include vegan 
dinners, trash sorting, documenta-
ry film viewings, brown-bag lunch 
lectures, an activist peer-mentor 
program and a reusable dishware 
program. 

“The programming would shape 
the space and will really be a key way 
in which the SRC can be an effective 
service for the entire campus com-
munity,” Reyes said. “This allows 
students who will become interns to 
take off with their own creative ideas 
to help the center evolve on campus 
as time goes on.”

The center will also sponsor the 
distribution of grants to research 
projects, outside-speaker invitations, 
building construction improvements 
and other student proposals. A 
review committee would be formed 
to develop and implement the cri-
teria in evaluating proposals and 
awarding grant money.

The A.S. Council will decide 
Wednesday if the proposed add-on 
will be included in the A.S. fee refer-
endum, which students will vote on 
later this year.

Dear Editor, 
Contrary to assertions in “Law 

Finally Cages Animal-Rights 
Guerillas,” published on Oct. 13, 
animal experimentation is neither 
well regulated nor humane. The 
federal law governing the use of 
animals in laboratories applies to 
less than 5 percent of the animals 
used in experimentation. Mice and 
rats, who suffer as much as larger 
mammals, represent more than 100 
million of the total animals used in 
experiments in the United States, yet 
they receive absolutely no protec-
tions under the Animal Welfare Act.

For the roughly one million ani-
mals that are covered, the existing 
laws provide only minimal hus-
bandry and veterinary care stan-
dards — clean food, potable water 
and prompt veterinary care — and 
are fully revocable with negligible 
justification. A September 2005 
audit concluded that experiment-
ers are failing to extend even these 
basic considerations to the animals 
in their care. Experimenters may 
have to fill out forms, but there is 
no law that protects animals from 
redundant, painful or pointless 
studies. 

No enterprise that allows think-
ing, feeling animals to be impris-

oned, poisoned, mutilated and 
killed is ethical or “humane” by any 
stretch of the imagination. Please 
visit www.stopanimaltests.com for 
more information.

Dear Editor, 
You will have the opportunity to 

vote in one of the most historic and 
important presidential elections in 
American history. You might not 
realize, however, that there are sev-
eral important California-specific 
initiatives you will be asked to con-
sider on the same ballot. Proposition 
3 — the Children’s Hospital Bond 
Act — is one of those important 
initiatives. Children’s hospitals treat 
the most serious and deadly diseas-
es and conditions, including cancer, 
heart defects, diabetes, sickle-cell 
anemia and cystic fibrosis. The 
number of children needing care 
in California is growing, but the 
space and equipment to treat them 
are not.

As the president and CEO of 
the California Children’s Hospital 
Association, I can assure you that 
children’s hospitals work every day 

to do everything possible to help 
all of the seriously ill and injured 
children who count on us all across 
the state for health care. However, 
California’s children’s hospitals face 
daunting challenges. Each year 
more than one million children are 
treated at children’s hospitals. Many 
are transferred from other hospi-
tals that don’t have the resources 
to treat them. Children’s hospitals 
are operating at or near capacity. 
Without additional capital invest-
ment in medical equipment and 
facilities, children’s hospitals simply 
will not be able to meet the needs 
of the region’s expanding pediatric 
population. 

Proposition 3 would provide 
$980 million for the 13 children’s 
hospitals in California to purchase 
state-of-the-art medical technolo-
gies and expand so they can make 
more room to take care of more 
kids. Not a penny from Proposition 
3 can be spent on anything but con-
struction or equipment at children’s 
hospitals. These funds cannot be 
raided or used for other purposes. 
Proposition 3 is a sound investment 
in facilities and technology that will 
enable care of children in commu-
nities across the state for genera-
tions to come. 

People often express their admi-
ration for children’s hospitals and 
their respect for the life-saving 
work done by our physicians and 

nurses. Please make this admira-
tion meaningful by voting “yes” on 
Proposition 3. Join Sens. Barbara 
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, former 
Gov. Pete Wilson, the California 
Business Roundtable, the League 
of Women Voters, California 
Chamber of Commerce, California 
Nurses Association, the California 
Federation of Teachers and many 
other leaders who have endorsed 
Proposition 3. Visit us at www.
ImagineWithUs.org for more 
information. Please vote yes on 
Proposition 3. Your vote will make 
a difference.

Dear Editor, 
I would like to submit a letter 

to the editor in response to a letter 
published on Oct. 13.

We are particularly proud of our 
summer study-abroad programs, 
the Global Seminars, which have 
become especially popular in the 
UCSD community, with great repu-
tations far and wide. Recently a note

Inever intended to use this column as an arena for political commentary, preferring instead to leave the ranting and raving for bom-
bastic professors, bantering A.S. councilmembers 
and the annoying Greenpeace gadflies on Library 
Walk (unless the university decides to ban them 
from campus, under new guidelines set by the 
alarmingly paternalistic UC Board of Regents in a 
policy that effectively bans nonaffiliate free speech, 
although that is a topic for a different day). 

My loyal readers may remember my past spiels 
on party manners, Facebook etiquette, pre-med 
assholes, Las Vegas and the ins-and-outs of being 
the only male among hundreds and hundreds of 
drunk lesbians. 

But after turning on my television the other 
day to discover a horrendously disgusting politi-
cal advertisement about Proposition 8, I had to 
relent. In case you’ve been living in the closet, 
Proposition 8, if passed, will eliminate the right 
of same-sex couples in California to legally wed 
by amending the state constitution to specifically 
outline marriage as the union of “one man and 
one woman.”

Backed by reactionary activists across the state 
who campaigned vigorously to obtain enough sig-
natures to place the initiative on this November’s 
ballot — following the California Supreme Court’s 
landmark decision earlier this year to grant gay 
couples the same marriage privileges as their 
straight counterparts — Proposition 8 is a fright-
ening attack on civil rights, not to mention a 
stupid and unnecessary waste of funding and 
political resources during a time of extraordinari-
ly immense economic uncertainty, a climate crisis 
and two hugely unpopular foreign wars.

causes (say, your children’s college funds or, if

ON CAMPUS — The excess paint from a bold 
“G” — beginning the phrase “Get up, stand up/ 
Stand up for your rights,” sprayed onto the wall 
of Mandeville Center’s second-floor staircase 
— runs down to the floor. The Bob Marley lyric 
is modestly written, small in comparison to sur-
rounding designs and messages; its relevance, 
however, resounds through the stairwell.

Spray painted in red and black, this sentiment 
embodies the overall atmosphere of Graffiti 
Alley, and the ideals it represents. At a time when 
so many of our student rights are being stripped 
without our knowledge or consent, the persis-
tence of Graffiti Alley should be of paramount 
importance. 

Unauthorized graffiti and its recent spread 
across all corners of Mandeville is an issue for 
many administrators, including those in UCSD’s 
Department of Admissions and School Relations 
and the nearby visual arts department. This has 

long been a source of frustration for students and 
administrators alike, and tensions have recently 
tightened. The fate of Graffiti Alley is uncertain 
as administrators in both departments simulta-
neously recognize its illegality and acknowledge 
it as an enduring tradition — still, an acknowl-
edgement not marked by approval. 

According to Stephen Hepwart, the direc-
tor of the University Art Gallery in Mandeville, 
there are various reasons for wanting to get rid 
of Graffiti Alley: Some feel the fumes are haz-
ardous, and administrators see the graffiti as 
unattractive, creating areas that the university 
can’t show off.

Spray painting the alley is technically ille-
gal, but the problem became more apparent 
last winter when the paint started to spread 
past one isolated spot. In late January, due to 
the proliferation of graffiti into other areas of 
Mandeville, administrators in the visual arts and 
music departments employed residential security 
officers to more strictly regulate student activity 
in Graffiti Alley.

“The administration told 
us the same things they do 

in a lot of things,” UCSD 
police Sgt. John Smart 
said. “They asked us 
to use our good judg-
ment. ... We take action 
by the Student Code 
of Conduct or write 
citations for vandal-
ism. ... The adminis-
tration wants to get it 
out to the public that 
this is vandalism. But 
we do realize that is it 
a long tradition, so we 

use our own discretion 
in every situation ... and 

usually handle it infor-
mally — usually a write-up 

or a citation.”
As if penalizing individu-

als in Graffiti Alley isn’t enough, 
the Department of Admissions and 

School Relations wants to ensure that 
possible future Tritons don’t know about 

the alley, asking its campus tour guides not 
to bring groups  to the stairwell or mention it 
at all because it is not authorized by the school, 
and apparently should therefore not be associated 
with the university. This sudden change of heart 

is another shocking blow to student freedom, 
arriving amid already shaky free-speech policies.

“The University instructs us not to men-
tion Graffiti Alley,” campus tour guide Rebecca 
Williams said. “It is because it is a part of the 
school that isn’t sanctioned. They don’t want 
people coming to the school and thinking it is 
okay with the administration to spray paint over 
Mandeville.”

While the actions occurring in the hallway 
may be outlawed, Mandeville’s graffiti-covered 
stairwell is a decades-old monument at UCSD.
The administration’s attempt to prevent students 
from spray painting and to discontinue the life of 
Graffiti Alley is not only thoughtless to the needs 
of students, it is futile — even on the weak claim 
that students could be in danger because of fume 
exposure.

“It’s not dangerous,” said Michael Capparelli, 
an Eleanor Roosevelt College senior who takes 
the staircase every day to class and work. “Most 
of the spray painting takes place at night, so the 
fumes are out of the hallway by the time students 
use it for class.” 

If fumes are indeed the administration’s 
concern, it should be kept in mind that there 
are other staircases in Mandeville that students 
could use instead of Graffiti Alley.

Most saddening is that the place administra-
tors wish to keep stowed away is filled with the 
voices, thoughts, concerns and personalities of 
UCSD’s active student body. Expressing oneself 
in a hallway already covered in graffiti can hardly 
be considered vandalism. The artwork ought to 
be seen as a proud product of our individualism, 
practiced in one of the only places that such an 
act could still be possible.

For some, Graffiti Alley is a place to feel rebel-
lious, as spray painting can instill a sense of defi-
ance. Some students scrawl messages and symbols 
generally perceived as crude and offensive; many 
others see Graffiti Alley as a safe haven in which 
to release their artistic inclinations. John Muir 
college senior Ji-San Lee has frequented Graffiti 
Alley throughout his college experience. 

“It was my outlet,” Lee said. “After a week or 
so of stress, myself and others would go there 
just to get it all out. In a university that puts a lot 
of pressure on students to do well academically, 
Graffiti Alley kept and keeps a lot of students 
sane. Some people find their outlet in gyms, I 
found mine in that hallway.”

renewable energy initiatives, because 
the polar icecaps are disintegrating 
whether or not two men decide to kiss 
and put rings on each other’s fingers), 
is being funneled by groups such as 
the American Family Organization and 
Focus on the Family to support bogus 
and shocking ads meant to provoke the 
public into fearing gay marriage as an 
attack on family values.

The latest commercial is a dis-
turbingly low blow: A kindergartener 
comes home from school, excitedly 
telling her mommy that she learned she 
can marry a princess when she grows 

up, followed by a close-up of mommy’s 
horrified  reaction. The ad proceeds to 
claim that if Proposition 8 doesn’t pass, 
public schools will essentially indoctri-
nate children with gayness. Or some-
thing like that.

Forget that the state education code 
doesn’t dictate teaching kids about 
marriage until they get older (and even 
then in the most basic of manners, such 
as examining the difference between 
dating and marriage) or that parents 
can choose to have their children skip 
lessons on sexual or other personal 
matters; forget that gay marriage has 
absolutely nothing to do with teaching 

children about proper life values.
All these radicals want to do is 

advance their personal homophobic 
agendas onto everyone else. And that’s 
sad. Hopefully, Californians won’t be 
fooled by these grossly distorted adver-
tisements and, come Election Day, 
vote to uphold equality under the law, 
whether they agree with being gay or 
not (again, a topic for a different day).

Besides, the widely circulated “Yes 
on 8” posters show kids reaching for 
adults’ crotches. To me, that creepy 
poster design is more disturbing than 
two committed adults of the same sex 
getting married.

UCSD ranks as one of the top 
public universities in the country. Our 
workload is heavy, and the academic 
and extracurricular standards we are 
expected to meet in order to suc-
ceed are challenging. Graffiti Alley 
is a place of retreat, separate from 
the world of exams, term papers and 
competitive pressure in which we oth-
erwise live. Many visit Graffiti Alley 
and do not even paint. 

“I know a lot of students who go 
to the hallway and just look around,” 
Lee said. 

It is a place where students can 
rest their eyes from the insipid fonts 
of schoolbook texts, and instead set 
them on colorful designs and mes-
sages. Some of the stairwell’s contri-
butions are controversial, some are 
humorous, some are pensive — but 
all are stimulating. You don’t have to 
be a frequent visitor or participant to 
recognize the importance of Graffiti 
Alley to the UCSD experience. 

“When you visit, you feel that the 
university is fostering a place for stu-
dents to have an opinion — thought-
ful, religious, vulgar, funny, political, 
whatever,” ERC sophomore Cassandra 
Kerkoff said. “They need to keep in 
mind the message they’re sending out 
to students in trying to get rid of it. To 
students, it seems like they’re saying, 
‘We don’t accept free speech, we don’t 
encourage it.’” 

It’s alarming but undeniable — the 
university is further painting itself 
as an enemy to free speech by shy-
ing from this popular and harmless 
form of expression. These increasingly 
active attempts to cease the activity 
in Graffiti Alley come at a time when 
outspoken discontent with authorita-
tive regulations is being silenced. The 
Free Speech Policy and the addition of 
Section 510 to the UCSD Policy and 
Procedure Manual forbids students 

to spontaneously gather in groups of 
more than 10 anywhere on campus in 
order to demonstrate.

Additionally, the UC Board of 
Regents has just discreetly passed a 
policy banning nonaffiliate access to 
university property for purposes of 
demonstration. Individuals speaking 
freely on Library Walk are in this 
way socially condemned, judged as 
unusual and as a disturbance to the 
university’s ever-precious peace. 

If we are to maintain our voice 
in campus affairs, the administrators 
in the UC Office of the President 
have ensured that what we’re going 
to say has the approval of the school. 
Our right to speak in a group has 
been muted, our right to assemble has 
been condemned, our right to wit-
ness the views of outsiders has been 
limited and now, the only opportunity 
for us to express any opinion — writ-
ten, drawn, or sprayed — without 
administrative interference is being 
threatened. Officials are frustrated 
that graffiti has leaked to other parts 
of Mandeville? Perhaps it is because it 
is one of the only places we have left 
to say what we think, and a tiny hall-
way hidden within the art department 
hardly provides enough room. 

A government should create laws 
and regulations for the people and 
by the people; a university holds the 
same obligations to its student body. 
The administration here at UCSD is 
failing to keep our greater interests in 
mind. Spray painting in Mandeville is 
technically illegal, but so is condemn-
ing our free speech. And until space is 
made somewhere else on campus for 
us to express ourselves without regula-
tion or pre-approval, students should 
spray away in the only place we have 
left to speak our minds.

It’s a good idea to share meals or take

From burritos to tacos, tortas to tostadas,

P erhaps you’ve seen them — just like any other students, with the exception of their cargo. Lugging cumbersome PD170 
cameras across campus, toting microphones 
attached to long poles and sun gun lights 
into classrooms and hauling colossal tripods 
on and off campus shuttles, UCSD film stu-
dents take advantage of new opportunities 
beyond the visual arts department to flex 
their filmic muscles.

While these students receive their foun-
dational education on the principles of edit-
ing, production and technique from the 
visual arts department, most students agree 
that these courses, while valuable, are purely 
theoretical. Film students are now looking to 
extradepartmental programs, festivals and 
clubs to put such theory into potentially 
lucrative practice.

Since being appointed ArtPower! film 
curator in January, Rebecca Webb has made 
it her goal to introduce such programs to 
film students while simultaneously increas-
ing the visibility of the visual arts depart-
ment. 

“Whenever I mention to anyone outside 
of UCSD, or even in UCSD, that there’s a film 
program here, people are really surprised,” 
Webb said. “Professors here [in other disci-
plines] who I talk to have no idea.”

Webb has organized a series of student 
film screenings at the Loft as part of a pro-
gram called Press Rewind ’08. These movies 

were of the 40 considered for the inaugural 
UCSD Up and Coming Student Film Fest 
Webb initiated earlier this year. Each Sunday 
in October, 10 movies between 10 and 15 
minutes in length are screened before an 
audience of students and film buffs.

Up and Coming Film Fest will precede 
the Press Rewind event every year and, 
according to Webb, will recognize excellence 
in student film in a more formal setting. 
For the inaugural festival, Webb assembled 
a panel of film critics, filmmakers and film 
professors to judge the 40 student submis-
sions, ultimately choosing 10 to receive an 
honorable mention. 

The panel included KPBS film critic Beth 
Accomando and Academy Award-winning 
filmmaker Ham Tran. Of the 10 select-
ed, Accomando invited the top two films 
from Eleanor Roosevelt College alumna 
Jessie Pellegrino and Sixth College alumnus 
Edward Kim to be screened at her own fes-
tival with the possibility of being aired on 
KPBS in the future.    

“UCSD has an isolated film program, so 
the festival is good to see your work and not 
just in the classroom,” said Jay Drose, John 
Muir College alumnus and creator of one of 
the top 10 films at this year’s Up and Coming 
Film Fest. “Hopefully more film students will 
feel motivated. Hopefully it inspires people 

T acos el Gordo in Chula Vista is an authentic, late-night Mexican restaurant. While the drive is long, it just might be the only option when you’re craving cow-brain tacos.   
Gordo’s menu and selection is notably different from most 

Americanized Mexican-food joints. If you’re in search of a California 
burrito, this is the wrong place. Along with the typical choices of 
pork and beef tacos, which cost no more than $2 apiece, Gordo 
serves up pork stomach, beef shoulder, cow tongue and cow-brain 
tacos. 

Typically, you’ll need to order a few tacos for a full meal. They’re 
TJ-style street tacos, small but fresh, and the ingredients are simple: 
no fries here. The shop’s slightly more expensive option is the mula, 
which, with two tortillas — one on bottom and one on top, and taco 
ingredients with melted cheese in the middle — still saves your wallet, 
coming in at under $4.

Gordo’s atmosphere is sparkling and the kitchen’s grill is openly 
displayed so that all food preparations are visible. While visions of hang-
ing meat being butchered up for sale might haunt a weak-stomached 
customer, at least you know it’s fresh.

I f you’re on your way to Moonlight Beach in Encinitas, Raul’s Shack is walking distance from the water and the perfect place to pick up some lunch before catch-
ing a few waves. 

Raul’s is exactly what its name implies — a shack.  
While ordering, usually by sticking your head into the 
serving window so that your voice can be heard, it isn’t 
uncommon to be startled by some of the free-spirited, 
barefoot locals shouting to each other nearby. Although 
the cashier always seems to be distracted by conversa-
tions with regulars, once his attention is caught and 
your order is placed, it won’t be long before you’re pour-
ing obscene amounts of hot sauce onto a juicy carnitas 
burrito. 

Sitting room is minimal, but as this eatery mostly 
attracts locals on the go, there is usually room to relax. 
Similarly, Raul’s parking lot has only four or five ill-
placed spots, though there is usually a space or two 
available. 

Raul’s burritos are a rare treat, full of fresh, (non-
greasy) meat, guacamole and salsa — not stuffed with 
fillers like rice and beans, sour cream or lettuce. Prices 
range from $2 tacos to $7 combination plates.

UCSD film students stretch their education by participating in new film programs

to be more competitive than they 
are. Class assignments don’t usually 
go anywhere, and [students] need 
more incentive to get better and to 
experiment.”

According to Webb, this year’s 
submissions to Up and Coming 
Film Fest varied in style but were 
connected thematically in their 
introspective and personal nature. 
Edward Kim’s film “Untitled” 
explores how a filmmaker searches 
for an original film idea. Daniel 
Kim, Sixth College senior and Press 
Rewind ’08 participant, created a 
film called “Dan in a Tube” that 
follows the main character as he 
battles with a copy of himself stuck 
in a TV. Drose’s film “Having Fun 
with Friends.” chronicles how an 
amorous encounter affects the lives 
of two characters.

Most of the films achieved pro-
duction through modest means, 
using rented equipment from the 
visual arts department, shooting 
in public spaces and using friends 
as actors.

“The theme of the Up and 
Coming was along the lines of ‘do 
it yourself,’ and that made me smirk 
because about three quarters of 
the time I was completely alone,” 
Daniel Kim said of his filming pro-
cess in an e-mail.        

For film students looking for 
a more interactive experience or 
simply a chance to create a lon-
ger piece, Muir Movie provides 
a unique opportunity. A student 
organization created six years ago, 
Muir Movie gives all students with 
an interest in film the space to 
write, produce and act in their own 
feature-length film. With a bud-
get of about $5,000, mostly funded 
by Muir College, students advance 

production from quarter to quarter 
and showcase their final product in 
the spring. 

While students from all col-
leges and disciplines are welcome, 
film students from the visual arts 
department find this program par-
ticularly advantageous because 
they are able to work without the 
constraints and limitations posed 
by classroom projects.

“[This is] an unprecedented 
opportunity which creates what I 
believe to be the best hands-on film-
making experience you can get at 
UCSD,” Graham Lee, Sixth College 
alumnus and last year’s Muir Movie 
chair, said in an e-mail.

According to Webb, these new 
and existing festivals and programs 
allow film students to use their the-
oretical educations to start creating 
films while also making connec-
tions that will benefit their even-
tual careers.   

“Some of the best advice for 
filmmakers is to just make stuff,” 
Daniel Kim said. “Class projects are 
a nice way to force yourself to fin-
ish something, but making things 
that you want to make yourself is 
dang important.”

Drose added that the breadth of 
a film student’s education at UCSD 
is in his or her own hands.

“There are no track options 
[writing, producing and other 
foci] and it’s really like treading in 
uncharted waters,” Drose said. “You 
really have to go out there and talk 
to people and have that L.A. mind-
set of networking. UCSD’s film pro-
gram is really apathetic, but people 
use that as a crutch. It’s really, in 
the end, what you make of it.”

vineyard and picnicking in the coun-
tryside, we hopped back into their dark 
green Peugeot minivan and my host dad 
turned on the radio. Nirvana’s “Rape 
Me” blared through the car’s speakers 
and my entire family started singing 
along. I was on the verge of laughter 
until my 7-year-old host sister Flavia 
asked what the song meant. 

I was cornered. Even if I did explain, 
there was no way I could put it elegantly. 
And then what? Then I’d be the per-
verted American who listens to music 
about rape, laughs about it and then 
explains it to innocent children. I knew 
I wasn’t responsible for Kurt Cobain’s 
throaty demand to be sexually violated, 
but I had a vague feeling that it some-
how represented American culture 
to my host family, and, by some sick 
and twisted cultural transitive prop-
erty, it therefore represented me. I faked 
incomprehension and hoped Lil Wayne 
hadn’t made it to French radio yet.

About a month later at dinner, my 
10-year-old host sister Anne-Charlotte 
didn’t want to eat her ratatouille and her 
mother got upset. By then I’d learned to 
listen carefully to their mealtime quar-
rels so I could memorize angry French 
comebacks for later use (I can do this 
without seeming creepy because, as a 
foreign exchange student, I’m practi-
cally a fly on the wall). I heard Anne-
Charlotte say that even though she 
didn’t like the traditional French dish, 
her appetite wasn’t distasteful. She wasn’t 
like the Americans, she explained, who 
only ate McDonald’s. Suddenly, I was no 
longer a fly. I was an American at the 
dinner table who’d just been insulted. 

Her mother slammed her fork down 
on her plate and swung her head in 
Anne-Charlotte’s direction. 

“I don’t understand you!” she yelled 
as spit flew out with the furious French 
pronunciation of each word. “Look!” 
she continued, as she flung her hand in 
my direction. “We have an American 
here and she eats EVERYTHING!”

Although their argument made me 
feel extremely awkward and a bit like 
a black hole, I couldn’t blame Anne-
Charlotte for stereotyping Americans. 
The McDonald’s in the centre ville of 
Lyon was likely the only American cui-
sine she’d experienced. I wasn’t upset 
over her generalization; just disap-
pointed she didn’t know we also eat 
international cuisine, like Chipotle and 
Panda Express. 

I didn’t know what to say so I resort-
ed to what I apparently do best: I ate 
everything on my plate. 

But it wasn’t until a week later when 
I was flossing my teeth and noticed 
that my three younger host sisters were 
behind me, watching with amazement, 
that I felt like I was in some eerie cul-
tural aquarium. I heard some incom-
prehensible French discussion behind 
me and then finally a direct question: 
“What are you doing?” the 13-year-old, 
Laurène, asked with genuine curiosity. 

With floss lodged between my gums, 
I gave a cavewoman-like explanation in 
French (“Good … for the teeth.”) then 
resorted to a demonstration. She stared 
at me and then left to retrieve her moth-
er. Together, the four of them lifted the 
tiny plastic floss-box cap and tugged on 
the white string. 

“How does it come out?” Anne-
Charlotte asked. 

More cavewoman French. 
Attempting to ignore their investigation, 
I reached for my electric toothbrush. As 
it began to vibrate in my mouth, their 
eyes lit up. 

“What is that?” Flavia asked. 
“Good for the teeth,” I said, as tooth-

paste foamed at the sides of my mouth. 
The weekend of Oct. 11, I visited 

a friend in Aix-en-Provence and we 
went to a Turkish hookah and tea bar. 
A French guy who worked there asked 
us if Americans really thought that 
French people walked around wearing 
berets and carrying baguettes. “Yes,” we 
replied. Even if we didn’t want to admit 
it, we stereotype too. He shook his head, 

laughed and admitted we weren’t too 
far off about the baguettes. Then he 
told us about customers who had come 
to his bar, sat down on beaded pil-
lows, smoked hookah and left thinking 
they’d found a true French establish-
ment. People like that could benefit 
from a lesson in stereotypes. If they’d 
known about the berets and baguettes, 
they could’ve wound up in an artisanal 
French bakery instead.

We also visited a photography muse-
um in Aix-en-Provence and struck up a 
conversation with its two employees. 
The first employee forced us to guess his 
age (36), then asked us if we liked “High 
School Musical” (“No.”) and finally told 
us he’d seen a clip of President George 
W. Bush trying to pull open a locked 
door at a press conference. As my friend 
steered the conversation toward local 
attractions, I asked his co-worker if 
it was easy to meet people in a small 
town like Aix. Admittedly, after our 
new friend immediately connected our 
American nationality to a door-retarded 
Bush, I had my doubts. 

“Don’t worry,” she said. “It doesn’t 
matter if you’re American. We have a 
saying in France: between intellectuals, 
there is never a problem.” 

But that worried me even more. I 
hadn’t verbalized the least bit of anxi-
ety about my nationality hindering my 
ability to meet French people, and as 
much as I’d like to be considered an 
intellectual, I probably speak French at 
a fifth-grade level. 

To be honest, sometimes I really 
do want to indulge in the stereotypical 
habits that give Americans a bad rap: 
I have the urge to eat McDonald’s in 
sweats while listening to songs about 
sexual pleasure and obsessively floss-
ing and brushing my teeth twice a day. 
And maybe this is just an inkling, but 
I wouldn’t be surprised if, somewhere 
in France, a French citizen is sitting at 
a cafe, beret on his head and a baguette 
under his arm, chain-smoking the day 
away.

ner kicks. Caplan led the UCSD attack 
with three shots in the match. Junior 
midfielder Tony Choi added two shots 
as a substitute. The loss drops the 
Tritons’ overall record 7-5-2 and 4-5-2 
in league play. 

The squad may have felt like the 
victims of some poor officiating, but 
head coach John Pascale did not hesi-
tate to admit his team was beaten by a 
better side.

“Dominguez is as good a team as 
we have seen all year,” he said. “They 
make you play at a high level for 90 
minutes. I thought they were two goals 
better than us on the day.”

Pascale was also quick to point out 
that his squad played with the intensi-
ty and work ethic that fans have come 
to expect in his first year at the helm. 

“At times we were defending well 
and we attacked better and moved the 
ball better than the first game,” he said. 
“We did the best we could.”

Choi also praised the Tritons’ 
effort, but pointed to a lack of focus as 
their downfall.

“I think we did well working hard 
and we tried to work together as a 
team,” he said. “We lost focus a couple 
of times and those lapses cost us mis-
takes that led to goals.

The Tritons, who have only three 
conference matches left in the season, 
still have a chance to make it to the 
playoffs, which has become the team’s 
focus.

“We are still in playoff contention,” 
Fernandez said. “We need to win all 
the rest of our games — there is no 
more room to lose.”

The Tritons returned home to 
battle conference powerhouse Cal 
State Los Angeles on Oct. 19 at Triton 
Soccer Field, but scores were not avail-
able as of press time. The final UCSD 
home match will be played against 
Seattle Pacific University on Oct. 25 
before the Tritons take to the road to 
play Cal State San Bernardino and Cal 
Poly Pomona on Oct. 31 and Nov. 2, 
respectively.

Tritons continued their dominance 
over Cal State Dominguez Hills by 
improving their all-time record ver-
sus the Toros to 37-1, with their 16th 
consecutive sweep of the program. 

Junior outside hitter Sylvia 
Schmidt served up a Triton attack 
early in the first set that resulted in a 
9-0 run. Taking advantage of several 
Toro errors, UCSD held an 18-9 lead 
and won easily, with six different 
Tritons registering kills in the set, 
which ended on four UCSD kills.

In the second game, the Tritons 
fell behind by four points on two 
occasions before mounting a 6-0 run 
to take the lead 17-15 after a block 
by Simonsen and senior outside hit-
ter Kimberly Carpenter. From that 
point on, the Tritons kept the lead 
and ended the game on consecutive 
aces by sophomore middle blocker 
Kaitlin Potter. 

With the momentum built up after 
winning the first two sets, the Tritons 

jumped out early with Williamson 
hammering down five kills to give 
UCSD the lead at 8-3. The Toros cut 
the deficit to four but were unable 
to mount a comeback, mainly due 
to Williamson, who finished the set 
with eight of her match-high 14 kills. 
The Tritons also put a lot of serv-
ing pressure on Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, adding to their No. 2 national 
ranking in service aces per set with 
11 on the night. 

Hoping to bounce back from their 
series split, UCSD returns to action 
against San Francisco State Oct. 24 at 
7 p.m. in RIMAC Arena. 

“The loss hurt,” Black said. “The 
only positives are learning the lessons 
and moving on. That’s the challenge 
this week — to learn from the games 
and to get better. I’m confident that 
we will, it’s just going to take some 
discipline.”

Weekend Split Drops 
Tritons to Second Place
▶ VOLLEYBALL, from page 12

UCSD for first place the entire season. 
McManus said UCSD’s play was top 
notch in the match against the Toros 
and could easily be rated as the team’s 
most important win of the season.

“It was a great game,” senior for-
ward Natasha Belak-Berger said. 
“Both teams had a lot on the line and 
brought their best game. Our team 
is really young but that was as domi-
nant as I have seen us play. We won’t 
necessarily forget such a big win, but 
we need to start focusing on our next 
three games and CCAA playoffs.” 

UCSD managed only eight shots in 
the contest but it didn’t matter as the 
Tritons toppled the Toros 2-1. The win 
ended the Toros’ seven-game winning 
streak and concluded a three-game 
road trip for UCSD, which proved it 
can win on the road. Belak-Berger said 
she plays an important role in getting 
the younger players psyched up for 
difficult away games. 

“Road trips are always hard,” Belak-
Berger said. “Our fans aren’t there and 
it feels different, but we adapt and get 
focused. My job as a senior is to show 
the freshmen the tradition of UC San 
Diego and get them fired up.”

Cal State Dominguez Hills put on 
an offensive showcase, outshooting 
the Tritons 17-8 during the game, but 
senior goalkeeper Jessica McGovern 
shut down the Toro offense allowing 
the lone goal off a corner kick.

UCSD took the early lead on a goal 
from sophomore Lisa Bradley. Bradley 
took the cross from senior defender 
Amanda Esquivel and knocked it by 
the Toro goalkeeper to the near post to 
give the Tritons a 1-0 lead going into 
intermission.

Out of the half, Belak-Berger scored 
her conference-leading 10th goal of 
the season giving the Tritons a two 
goal advantage. Cal State Dominguez 
Hills would tack on its goal in the 75th 
minute but couldn’t get the equalizer 
past McGovern’s solid performance.

The Tritons now have some time 
to recover from the difficult week of 
play. They will face the Academy of 
Arts on Oct. 25 before concluding 
conference play the following week. 
McManus said the team is looking 
past this week’s match only because it 
isn’t a conference match.

“[Academy of Arts] has played 
Sonoma State and San Francisco State 
to 1-0 games,” he said. “Hopefully we’ll 
get some bench players involved in 
the game, which has been hard to do 
because we played pretty poor against 
CSULA.”

The Tritons will finish their season 
when they try on the road to avenge a 
double-overtime loss to Cal State San 
Bernardino and finish a season sweep 
against Cal Poly Pomona.

Controversy Muddles Tritons’ DefeatUCSD HOLDS 
TOP SPOT 
AFTER TIE

By Robert Ingle
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Riding 
a three-game winning streak, the No. 
13 UCSD women’s volleyball team 
looked to be playing at its peak form 
entering games on Oct. 16 and 17. 
However, the Tritons were only able to 
extend their recent success for one of 
the two matches, sweeping Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 25-15, 25-21, 25-18 
on Thursday night before falling to 
Cal State Los Angeles 25-27, 23-25, 
25-18, 25-18, 15-9 on Friday. After 
the contests, the Tritons dropped to 
15-4, with a 9-3 record in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association stand-
ings.

Sophomore middle blocker Cara 
Simonsen said the team used the 
momentum from its first game, in 
which the Tritons dominated the 
Toros, to start the match off strong 
against the Golden Eagles.

“We went into that game against 
Los Angeles feeling confident,” 
Simonsen said. “And it showed in the 
first two games. We put out a lot of 
intensity and executed really well.”

The Tritons grabbed the momen-
tum early against No. 19 Cal State Los 
Angeles (16-3, 9-3 CCAA), mainly 
behind the play of senior outside 
hitter Rebecca Bailey. The UCSD all-
time career kills leader started strong, 
recording nine of her match-high 19 
kills in the first set. Despite Bailey’s 
solid play, the Golden Eagles kept the 
game close and managed to tie the 
score six times before UCSD took the 
win on a Cal State Los Angeles ball-
handling mishap. 

In the second set, UCSD fell 
behind early and was down 10-5 after 
several attack errors before mount-
ing a rally to tie the score at 11. 
Both squads unsuccessfully fought 
to take control of the set until the 
Tritons pulled ahead 22-21 and fin-
ished the game with kills by Bailey 
and freshman outside hitter Hillary 
Williamson. 

With UCSD taking the first two 
sets, the Golden Eagles made some 
adjustments that caused the Tritons 
to get out of their game plan. 

“They are a real good team, so 
we expected them to make a charge, 
especially on their home court,” head 
coach Tom Black said. “They had a 
strong showing [in the third set] and 
we lost our composure a little bit and 
our serving struggled as a result. We 
spent a lot of time trying to recover, 
and that really didn’t happen.”

Taking sets three and four, the 
Golden Eagles swept up the momen-
tum and carried it into the deci-
sive fifth set by jumping out to an 
early lead. Trailing 8-2, the Tritons 
attempted a comeback with kills by 
Bailey and Williamson and a ser-
vice ace by senior defensive specialist 
Michelle Torres. However, Cal State 
Los Angeles managed to maintain its 
lead, rallying to stay ahead. Freshman 
outside hitter Katie Condon stepped 
up for the Tritons with two more kills, 
but the Golden Eagles fended off the 
UCSD attack and took the match. In 
the defeat, Williamson finished with 
12 kills and 15 digs while Condon 
added eight kills. Simonsen led the 
Tritons with a team-high six blocks.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — Reeling 
off five straight victories and a tie in 
their past six games, the Tritons now 
hold sole possession of first place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

After knocking off then 12th-
ranked Sonoma State, the Tritons found 
a rhythm recording three shut-outs and 
another win over a ranked opponent.

The streak pushes the Tritons’ 
overall record to 12-2-1 with a 9-2 
conference record, best in the CCAA. 
Despite the stellar standings, UCSD 
remains off the radar in the national 
polls. But according to head coach 
Brian McManus, rankings don’t mean 
anything.

“We know how good we are and 
act and play accordingly,” he said. “We 
have won the South Division practi-
cally every year since we have been in 
it. The target is on our back, not anyone 
else’s.”

The tie came Oct. 18 against Cal 
State Los Angeles at RIMAC Field. 
While disappointed that they couldn’t 
get the win, the Tritons are settling with 
the 0-0 draw.

“It was ugly,” McManus said. “It 
wasn’t our best performance of the year, 
but we were coming off a big win over 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. That win 
drained a lot of players and we didn’t 
recover.”

The win McManus refers to came 
against No. 20 Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, which has been battling with

MEN’S WATER POLO — After nearly 
two years since their last home victory, 
the No. 7 Tritons finally broke their 
drought in a big way. Leading 13-0 
at one point in the game, the UCSD 
men’s water polo team went on to crush 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 20-4 on Oct. 
17, giving the Tritons their first home 
victory since 2006.

“It was good to get that first win 
at home,” senior driver Jeff Hunt said. 
“We didn’t get one all of last year so it 
was big.”

UCSD wasted no time getting 
on the board as senior driver Adnan 
Jerkovic scored first for the Tritons 
just over a minute into the game. The 
Tritons left no room for a response 
from CMS, as they added five more 
goals in the period, including two from 
senior driver Chance Vermilyea. 

The Tritons continued their offen-
sive attack in the second quarter, net-
ting four more goals while holding 
CMS scoreless in the first half. 

UCSD didn’t let up in the second 
half, preserving the shutout until CMS 
converted on a six-on-five opportunity 
with 2:40 left in the third quarter. The 
Tritons were able to find playing time 
for a large portion of their roster, with 
nine different Tritons finding the goal 
during the match. 

Amid a schedule filled with tough 
opposition, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
was the first unranked opponent for 
the Tritons since Sept. 20 when UCSD 
faced Cal Baptist University in the 
NorCal Tournament. 

“We never try to overlook any team,” 
senior utility A.J. Kotanjian said. “We 
just needed to get in, show that we are 
the better team and hold their team to 
as few goals as possible.”

The win was extra sweet for the 
team’s five seniors, who collectively 
scored 11 goals on Senior Night. 

“It capped the night off really well,” 
Hunt said of the senior ceremony fol-
lowing the game. “It would have put a 
damper on the night if we had lost.”

The win improved the Tritons’ over-
all record to 14-6 and their Western 

Water Polo Association record to 3-2. 
UCSD will go back to facing ranked 
opponents next weekend when it faces 
No. 8 UC Santa Barbara on Oct. 24 
and WWPA opponent No. 6 Loyola 
Marymount University on Oct. 25, with 
both games on the road. The Tritons 
will be looking for their first victory 
over LMU this season while trying to 
earn their third over the Gauchos.

“We know going into it that this is 
going to be one of the hardest weekends 
of the season,” Kotanjian said. “It will 
be the third time we face these teams 

and we won both games against UC 
Santa Barbara by one goal and lost both 
games against LMU by one goal.”

With UCSD and LMU being the 
highest-ranked teams in the WWPA, 
the matchup in Los Angeles between 
the two teams holds extra weight.

“We want prove to the water polo 
world that us and LMU are going to be 
in the WWPA Championship game,” 
Kotanjian said.

MEN’S SOCCER — After an impres-
sive road win against Chico State on 
Oct.12, the men’s soccer team looked 
to continue its momentum as the 
Tritons traveled to Carson, Calif., to 
take on Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The Oct. 15 midweek match gave the 
Tritons the opportunity to take down 
yet another team from the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association and 
take a major step toward playoff 
qualification. Instead, UCSD gave up 
a controversial goal less than two 
minutes into the match and never 
recovered, falling 2-0. 

The Tritons came into the match 
with aspirations of upsetting the 
Toros, who have yet to lose at home 
this season. However, they were on 
the wrong end of an odd play that 
occurred shortly after the start of 
the match. In the second minute, Cal 
State Dominguez Hills freshman for-
ward Greg Piechota played a ball into 
the box to teammate and senior mid-
fielder Kyle Holland, who appeared 
to have committed an obvious hand 
ball — so obvious that players from 
both sides stopped playing, expecting 
the referee to make the easy call. But 
Holland did not stop, and knocked 
the ball past stunned senior goal-
keeper Peter Akman, who could only 
watch as his team went down a goal 
in the early moments of the match. 
The score seemed to take the wind 
out of the Tritons’ sails, as they found 
themselves undeservedly down 1-0 
against a tough team on the road.

“I don’t like to make excuses but 
the way the game started off made it 
tough to battle back against such an 
established team like Dominguez,” 
senior forward Tony Fernandez said. 
“We don’t do well when we get behind 
— it doesn’t work in our favor. Such a 
change of environment within the 
first two minutes distracted a lot of 
the guys. It makes it tough to bounce 

back from that.”
With the Toros up early, the 

Tritons were forced to change their 
game plan and focus on their attack 
in order to earn an equalizer. But 
that strategy backfired as Cal State 
Dominguez Hills found the net again 
in the 27th minute. Senior midfielder 
Carmelo Terranova collected a loose 
ball 25 yards out and blasted a shot 
past Akman, who could not stretch 
far enough to make a diving save. 

Down 2-0, the Tritons came out 

strong in the second half and created 
a number of scoring opportunities. 
Senior forward Tom Caplan, junior 
defender Daniel Pavitt and sopho-
more defender Tyler Zuppan all had 
shots at the keeper but failed to put 
one home, leaving the Tritons goal-
less for the fifth time in six games. 

The Toros dominated most of the 
offense, outshooting the Tritons 20-9 
and earning a 4-3 advantage on cor-

their lives.  2-for-1 Discount for UCSD Faculty/Staff

Sonya Kitchell and The Slip - This budding artist’s

her taste, her preternatural musical savvy and her 
depth-as in deep. Once the novelty of this has worn off, 
the listener can simply soak up the myriad pleasures 
and insights of Kitchell’s music, because this artist’s 
achievements are without caveat-Kitchell is the real 
deal, pure and simple.  Mon., Oct 27, 8pm at the Loft.

Nebraska Senator Ernie Chambers 
recently brought a lawsuit against 
God, attempting to obtain an injunc-

tion to prevent him or her, from “com-
mitting acts of violence such as tor-
nados and earthquakes.” The court 
dismissed the matter on grounds that 
God had not been properly served, 
and no doubt swayed by the presence 
of God’s counsel Johnnie Cochran.
