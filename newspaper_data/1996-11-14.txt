Forum Allowed Public to Voice Concerns 
About the Future of Health Care 
CRISIS: People look to expert 
panelists for solutions to urgent 
health care problems 
By Sara Moosavi 
Staff Wrtter 

In order to promote public awareness and pre-
pare health-care customers for the changes that 
will accompany the industry '~ rapid consolida-
tion , UCSD and KPBS-FM co-sponsored a free 
public forum "Medicine, Merger and Managed 
Care: The Health Care Revolution Hits Home" at 
the IRIPS Robin Auditorium on Monday, Nov. 
II from 6:30-8:30 p.m. 

The event featured Marc Roberts. a Harvard 
political economi I, and a panel of local heallh 
expert . Roben started off the evening with a 
brief presentalion that offered background infor-
mation regarding the heallh-care indu Iry and it 

prcsent revo lutionary state. 
According to Robert s, it is evident that capital-

ism has hit the health-care industry - the larg,est 
indu try in the .S. - because of recent moves 
made by the sector to cut co ts and achieve greater 
efficiency through consolidation. 

Once Roberts opened up the forum to discus-
ion, the media - represented by The San Diego 

Union-Tribune, The San Diego Daily Transcript , 
and KPBS - que tioned the paneli ·tson a variety 
of health-care related subjects. 

Panelist John Alksne, the UCSD Dean of the 
School of Medicine, was questioned about the 
necessity of a medical school at UCSD, when the 
United State i already producing 25 percent too 
many physicians. 

Alksne said that although there are many medi -
cal schools in the United States., a disproportion-
ate number are located out ideofCalifornia. There-

The meeting focuscd speCifica lly on the

Vice Chancellor of tudent Affairs Joe 
Wat on said . "We need to look at every-
thing, including the focus of these program " 
and see where to go from there." 

One student ca lled UCSD "cold" and 
said he wa concerned about the fu ture of 
certai n race-targeted programs on campus, 
such as the Summer Bridge program which 
offers services to incoming freshmen mi -

Marshall College Dean Rafael Hernande/. 
added that although the future of the Sum-
mer Bridge had not been deCIded, if the 
program was not cut , then it would be re-
worded in order to comply wi th the new 
state law. 

Hernandel said that this might mean that 
participant in the program would be se-

ueSD Professor's Study Sheds Light on Why We Sleep 
SNOOZE: Link in

Leena Shankar 
Staff Writer 

UCSD Neurobiology Professor 
Terrence Sejnowski and his interna-
tional research team recently dis-
covered communication between Ihc 
cortex and thalamus during sleep. 

"This is a real achievement and 
we are looking toward the nexl cen-
tury wilh growing exc itement ," 
Sejnowski sa id. "This nex t century 
may be the century of Ihe brain:· 

ejnowski - head oflhe System 
eurobio logy Laboratory at the Salk 

Institute and an investigator or the 
Howard Hughes Medical Institllte 
- and hi~ team have worked on thi s 
study for more than two years, hop-
ing to find an answeno why humans 
sleep. 

"There is so much going on in 
the cortex during sleep." Sejnowski 
said. "You reali/e this when you 
wake up during a dream, but that 
acti vi ty is j ust the tip or the iceberg 
- there is a 10 1 more going on." 

Sejnowski and his team - led by 
Alain Dextexhe and Mireea Steriade 
al the Laval Universi ty School of 
MedicineinQuebec,Canada- have 
been studying the origin and coordi -
nation of electrica l brain waxes in 
calS by using an 
electroencephalogram (EEG). 

The waves - or sleep spindles 
- are strong electrica l impulses that 
form as the transi tion is made from 
being awake to falling into a deep 
sleep. These waves occur through -
out the cortex evcry 10 seconds, in 
bursts that last ror one to three sec -
onds. 

Experiments were conducled at 
Lava l ni ve rsity in order to prove 
that these waves arc synchronized. 
Eight electrodes were placed al vari-
ous points on the surface oran ane~­
theti zed eat 's cortex. The research-
ers then noted. with the lise of an 
EEG, that the IccI' pindles were 
generated by the thalamus and then 
synchroniled in the vari ous parts of . 
the cortex. 

To delermine whether the syn-
chroni zation was coordinalCd by the 
cortex or the thalamu , researchers

I f the cortex was resp(lnsible ror

chron ()u~ activity occurred across 
the slice thereby proving that the 
Ihalamus cOl11mUniCale~ wi th the 
cortex 10 keep the sleep spind les in 
tunc. 

' 'There is a communication wire 
between the cortex and the thala-
mus," Sejnowski aid. ''The feed-
back connection is an indirect roule 
through the thalamus which acts as 
a mirror between the diffcrent part 
of Ihe cortex ." 

Cats are used in this research 
partly because they spend the ma-
jori ty of their time sleeping and also 
because mue~ is known ahout their 
physiology. 

"Cats were chosen about fift y 
years ago for sleep resean.:h for no 
particular reason except that a lot is 
known about th e ca t brain ." 
Sejnowski ~ai d . "So it is j u~ t a his-
tori cal accident that we arc working 
wi th cats." 

"A ll llf Ihe experimen ts were

ou t of a review paper that I puh-

McCormick at Yale and Mircea 
Steriade at Laval," Sejnowski said. 
"I am very fortunate to get together 
with some of the world 's best re-
searchers and bene lit from their vast 
knowledge." 

Sejnowski and histcam have also 
been exploring the techniqucs of 
computational neurobiology. 

" We can simulate a single ncu-
ron and then create a network popu-
lated with neu rons. sing comput-

Lawless Protests Are Poor 
ReflliDi1S8S to Prop. 209 

As citizens of the world 's greatest democracy, all of us 
have the right and the responsibility to infiuence govern-
ment policy for the better. If we don't agree with a particu-
lar law or ruling, we have the right to lobby the govern-
ment for change. 

However, there is a difference between civil disobedi-
ence and mere lawlessness. Disobedience is refusing to 
obey a law that is plainly morally objectionable. 
Lawlessness is characterized by senseless di sruption of the 
publ ic peace. 

Recent student demonstrations against the passage of 
Proposition 209 are not exercises in civil disobedience. 
Quite simply, they are tantrums by students who are 
unwilling to accept the fact that a solid majority of 
Californians voted to end race- and gender-based prefer-
ence programs. 

Students at UC Berkeley staged a four-day protest, the 
culmination of which was the barricading of 30 students in 
the Campanile bell tower. Students literally chained t.hem-
selves to the structure until police arrived with bolt cutlers 
and placed them under arrest. Students at UC Riverside 
saw tit to take over the administration building on Monday, 
vowing not to leave until the chancellor agreed to a list of 
their demands.This demonstration had to be broken up by 
the police Monday afternoon after disrupting administrative 
business for more than six hours. 

Even UCSD is not immune to these protests. Anti-209 
demonstrators disrupted at least five classes yesterday 
morning. 

It 's one thing to hold a public rally or protest. It's quite 
another thing to engage in lawless activity merely for the 
sake of drawing attention to a clearly unpopular cause. 
Student demonstrators are free to exercise their right to free 
speech in order to change other people's minds, but lawless 
behavi.,r will do nothing to change the fact that Proposition 
209 is now that law of our state. 

Last week, some UC Berkeley students became very 
upset at the Daily Californian for its election-day endorse-
ment of Proposition 209. The students, reportedly mem-
bers of the Coali[ion to Defe.nd Aftinnative Action By Any 
Means Necessary, became so upset, in fact, that they took it 
upon themselves to steal nearly all 23,000 copies of the 
newspaper distributed on the morning of election day, The 
individuals apparently followed the paper's delivery trucks 
and removed the papers as soon as they were placed in 
their racks. 

Judging from these despicable actions, it seems that 
some UC Berkeley students feel freedom of the press 
should be guaranteed only for those people who hold polit-
ically correct opinions. . 

It's not just the crime of theft that bothers us, even 
though tbe Daily Cal lost thousands of dollars due to the 
cowardly actions of a t~w indivi"uats. Rather, we are upset 
that some people took it upon themselves to censor opin-
ions they found objectionable. 

Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that groups who pro-
claim want to advance their causes "by any means neces-
sary" take it upon themselves-{o deny the right of free 
speech to others. We do, however, wonder just how far 
these students will go to further their agendas. We hope 
that UCSD students recognize that in a democracy our dis-
putes get settled at the ballot box - not through criminal 
activity. Stealing newspapers is a violation of human and 
civil rights - pure and simple.

You know, I love California 
- I dig the ocean, the deserts, 
the rivers, the Bay, the year-
round sun , the purple mounlains

grain, blah blah blah. 

I like the fast-paced, never- ' 
never land of Los Angeles. [like 
the intellectual sophistication of 
the Bay 
Area. 

I like the 
laid-back, 
relaxed atti -

thing you won't find in New York 
or Philadelphia. By the same token, 
I'm glad we ' re not as laid back as 
those hicks in Dallas and Lincoln, 
Nebraska. 

report revealed that Woods had no foundation and he 
simply lacked the qualifications to be hired." . 

Still, 209 's proponents insist, merit, not race, ought 
to determine one 's just desserts. 

Nice idea, but like most popular social theories, it 's 
riddled with holes. For instance, let's consider educa-
tion, and how "merit" and "fairness" play into acade-
mics. 

Let 's consider the UC Board of Regents, who 
weren ' t placed in charge of 
California's educational edifice 
because of thei r commitment to 
academics, their education-admin-
istralive expertise or their long 
association with scholarly pursuits. 

No, most regents were selected 
because of their connections with 
the current governor - construc-
tion contractors, lawyers and the 
just plain ri ch with whom Pete 
Wi Ison consorts and from whom he 
accepts campaign donations. 

However, the idiocy thai per-
vades the mob mentality of 
Californians drives me nuts. Once 
again, lhe Slate has signaled its sin-
gular stupidity to the nation. I'm 
referring to the recent passage of 
Proposition 209, a.k.a. the 
"California Civil Rights Initiative." 

I propo .. , In order 
to combat thl. 

What should have killed public 
support for 209 - which Regent 
Ward Connerly helped write - was 
the hypocrisy of the regents, many 
of whom called for a "level playing 
ground" while at the same time 
intervening on behalf of unquali -
fied, yet connected, relatives and 
friends who applied to the 
University of California. One 
regent directly interceded when 
UCLA rejected her daughter, who 
was subsequently admitted. 

You idiots. 
I could go on, just ranting and 

raving about how stupid you are. 
However, I won't continue to call 
all of you "concerned political 
thinkers" idiots without reason. 

Most people voted for 209 
because they felt that minorities and 
women had an unfair advantage 
over "everyone else" - mainly, 
white males. How many times have 
you heard someone's lall tale 
describing how "their" spot was 
taken by an unqualified minority'!

Now that 209 has eliminated

just how much allirmative action 
affected admissions at UC 

If you haven't heard one or these angry little myths, 
here's one, reported by George M,,{Jlynn in the San

anecdote about him being passed over for a plum

featured an average S.A.T. score of 1155 and an aver-
age GPA of 3.67. The 1994 entering freshmen class-
six percent black, 14 percent Hispanic, 32 percent 
white and 39 percent Asian - had a higher SAT.

WELL-RoUNDED INTELLECTS LACKING AT UCSD 
By Mlc ..... Martin 
Contributing Opinion Writer. 

Few of us like to reminisce 
about the deei ion-making process 
that culminated in ou r enrollmenl 
al UCSD. As a firsl -year student, 
that process is still fresh in my 
memory. although I'm sure that 
even upperclassmen can remember 
the anxiety and stress thai went into 
applying to co lleges. 

I have a bit of a beef wi th our 
fine uni versi lY, and I've been wai l-
ing quite a while for the right 
opportunilY to vent. As I' ve waited, 
my eyes have been opened to the 
knowledge that this issue is not iso-
lated. It is systemic, and a part of 
bOlh professo rs ' and si udents' men-
tality. 

My problem is simply that for 
most tudents at UCSD, it is too 
difficult to find enough lime to dab-
ble in a few fields of interest, finish 
general-education requirements, 
focus on one's major and graduate 
in four years. I'm having a really

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursaay, November 14, 1996 

HOMOSEXUALITY ARTICLE MISUSED BIBLE 
Editor: 

Aaron Chan made some val id 
points in hi s artic le "Gay Bashing 
Has 0 Place in Reli gion" 
(Gllardial/, Nov. 7), but he also 
missed some rundamental observa-
tions. 

Chan asks "does the Judeo-
Christian tradi tion really condem n 
homo exuality?" Although the Old 
Testament clearly prohibits acts of 
sodomy ancl other gay sex (reca ll 
the destructi on of Sodom and 
Gomorra), the New Testament 
preaches "agape," or love of every-
one. But rurther interpretation 
reveals that Chri sti ans should love 
the si nner and hate the sin . 
Chri stianity embraces people who 
are gay, but condemns the acts in 
which they choose to participate. 
Groups like Campus .crusade for 
Christ denounce those who choose 
to sin willfully. 

Chan correctly notes that the 
laws of Leviticus clearly outline 
what is permitted and what is not 
permitted in terms of homosex ual 
acts . But Chan also states that these 
laws were intended merely to dif-
ferentiate the Jews from those of 
other nations. If these laws just di s-
tinguish one group from another, 
isn' t that what contemporary laws 
disfavoring homosexuality arc 
doing today? If 0, what's wrong 
with that1 

Religion is what a person says 
he believes in . If a person 's religion 
says that being gay is sinrul and 
wrong, then that is what his reli -
gion says. What is the use in saying 
that such a doctrine goes against 
what's written in some book? 

Chan should be careful to avoid 
using the Bib le to prove his points. 
After all , other Christian groups 
also use the same evidence against 
his positions. 

All in all , we should all keep our 
integrity and stick to what we think 
is right. We are guara nteed thi s 
freedom under the Constitution.

Important Points 
Missed In Gay Article 
Editor: 

It was a pleasant surprise to read 
in your page~ the argument that 
there are no biblical grounds for 
condemnation or homosexuality 
("Gay Bashing Has No Place in 
Rcligion," Guardian, Nov. 7), but I 
would take issue with the sugges-
tion that loving same-sex relation-
ships were not known in the 
am:ient world . The Bible itself 
arguably provides an example in 
the relationship of David and 
Jonathan. Another notable example 
is Alexander the Grcat and

Hcphaestrion. On the other hand, 
abusive sexual relations - both 
heterosexual and homosexual -
appear to have been familiar 
enough to Biblical writers. 

The arti cle suggests that 
Leviticus forbids "men lying with 
men" only as a ritual impurity. It is 
important to note that, in the

Hebrew and Greek version , the 
words commonly translated into 
English as "abomination" in those 
verses indeed usually indicate ritu-
al impurity, or taboo. The words 
normally used to indicate moral 
wrongdoing were not employed in 
those verses. 

In the column, no mention is 
made or the book of Romans or of 
the destruction or Sodom. It is 
believed by many that both orthe e 
are to be understood as condemn-
ing homosexuality. Serious argu-
ments have been made, however, 
that a careful reading reveals the 
contrary in both cases. 

In the space or a letter or a short 
article, it is impossible either to do 
justice to thi s very important topic 
or to undo a lifetime of malignant 
homophobic programming. People 
interested in ex ploring this ques-
tion can profit from a visit to the 
Obelisk bookstore in Hillcrest or to 
the public library on E Street. 

Douglas Gray 

Anti-CCRI Letter 
Contradicts "self 
Editor: 

Opponents of CCRI repeated 
familiar arguments in their letters 
to the editor (Readers' Forum, 
Guardian, Nov. II ). One contribu-

tor writes that " i n determining 
laccomplishments and merit], gen-
der and ethnic background are just 
as telling as extracurricular activi-
ties." Yet this reader insists that it is 
her opponents, and not she, who is 
racist. Another urges the reader to 
think of "the barrio or the ghetto," 
yct advocates programs that favor 
middle-c las individuals over low-
income ci tizens with the wrong 
skin color. Both deplore the fact 
that race and gender have not yet 
become irrelevant in society, but 
call for policies under which race 
and gender can neve r become irrel-
evant. Buried under a mountai n of 
evidence to the contrary, they con-
tinue to claim that prererential pro-
grams do not promote unqualified 
applicants, or dismiss such promo-
tion as an aberration that is being 
"mended." 

It is onl y natural that the oppo-
nents of CCRJ would attempt once 
agai n to use the same self-contra-
dicting arguments that for 30 years 
served to protect preferential pro-
grams from honest examination. 
Clearly, however, this latest 
attempt to rool all of the people all 
of the time has finally run out of 
steam.

OK, let 's make the situation

Vice Chancell or of Enrollment 
M anagement and Registrar, said 
there wi ll be ncw critcri a for admit-

to the sociocconomic status or the

However. the admissions pro-

with 60 pcrcent of students admit-
ted according to academics alone, 
and the othcr 40 percent admittcd 
aflertaking into account leadership 
skill~, community service, socio-
economic cnvi ronmcnt, and other 
special circumstances, Backer said. 

Watson sa id that pri vate high 
schools - which do not have to' 
report student socioeconomic sta-
tus to the state - would he respon-

Turn a roll of 

sible for reporting this information 
to the university. 

Theapplication process will also 
have an expanded vcrsion of the 
essay portion. This will give stu-
dents the opportunity to answer . 
three essay qucsti ons in which thc 
may address special condit ions for 
considcration . 

Watson said that this would give 
an advanrage to those . tudents who, 
for example, "busscd for two hours 
a day in order to get a good cduca-
ti on" and as a re ult did not fall into 
the group of high schools that rc-
ceived ext ra points under the edu-
cational environment critcria. 

Asidc from Proposi tion 209, stu -
dents also voiced concern over thc 
current status of the Office for Stu-
dents With Disabilities (OS D). 

Three hearing-impaired students 
at the lI1ecting said they were dis-
turbed by the recent temporary re-
duction ofOSD taff, as well as the 
shortage of interpreters.

the that note takers for students

ers not showi ng up or being late for

Backer said that the stafr was 
reduced this quarter beeause of ci r-
cumstances beyond ad ministrative 
con trol - one OSD employee re-
ported ly quit suddenly, and another 
is out of commi ss ion due to an 
automobile acc ident. 

Backer also said the administra-
tion has reccntly taken steps to alle-
viate the problem or parking on 
cam pu , which may have been 
partly responsi ble for problem wi th 
interpreters and note takers. 

However, he aid that although 
no cuts were made to OSD, current 
funding could not keep up with the 
recent influx of students with dis-
abi lit ies.

talents of the last three were tapped by 
Matthews from the 100:al Virginia jazz 
circuil when Matthews was a bar-
tender at The Miller. a Charlottesville 
hangout. The re~u lt is a unique blend 
of jau, folk , funk , an rock, led by 
Matthews' di stinct voca ls and sop~i s­
ticated lyrics. 

In an exclusive interview with the 
Guardian, bass player Lessard gave 
hi s insight into the dynamic group. the

music and what it was like 10 bask in

Guardian: The Dave Matthews 
Band came together in an 
unusual way. Can you explain 
that? 

Lessard: It \ turted off when Dave 
wrote a couple songs about six or 
seven years ago when he worked as a 
bartender - LeRoi and arter used to 
play in the bar, and I would occasion-

me if I wanted to play with them just

Gibson 's solid acting as the

what 11U1d, the movie together. He

Rene Russo plays her 
role as Gihsnn's wife as a more 
pragmatic character rather than just 
a worried parent. A grieving mOlh-
er, she is shocked that her husband 
would make such an impulsive 
judgment and risk thei r sun's life.

The film fluctuates between the

Band to perform at

Continued from page 11 

of us worked on hi s songs and 
orne new songs, and we had a lit-

tle setli st going. A couple of 
months later Boyd Tinsley carne 
into the picture. We actually had a 
keyboardist at first , but he Icft the 
band. 
Compared to Under The 
TIIbIe IIItd Dream;"., Dave 
described CruJr as a "sexj. 
er" "urn. How would you 
describe it? 

In a way it feels more melan· 
choly. Jt feels like the difference in 
swimming in a lake and resting by 
the fireside sipping on a cogna . 
Was the SOfI& "Cry Free-
dom" a personal retrospec. 
tive for Dave, being that he 
is from South Africa? 

I think il was in a way. It was 
written during apartheid. I Ihink 
that it was also in general, too, 
around the world - the real ity of 
him looking out at the world from 
CharloUesville, Virginia at all the

I listen to a lot of reggae, I go 
into a lot of the ambient dub-thing. 
I listen to King Crimson, and I go 
into a lot of jazz and classical. I 
also e pecia ll y like Nirvana and 
Smashing Pumpkins - theIr 
Siamese ()ream album - I love 
that a lbum. One of my fa vorites 
righ l now is Beck. I go with every-
thing - rap, Beastie Boys, whal -
ever it is - just as long as ii 's 
good. 
How important is the Inter· 
net and the Dave Matthews 
Band website in communi-
cating with fans? 

I think it 's huge , e~pel.:ially with 
w many people on-line. Wc' \,': 
received a lot of good hits, and ;lOW 
we've eX lended ou r wehsite to

What was it like opening for 
the Grateful Dead? 

I personally never knew too 
much about the Grateful Dead. I had 
li stened to a few of their albums, but 
I had never beef) to a show or any-
thing. It was a very cool experience. 
Carter got up on stage and played 
with them. It was like we were play-
ing with legends, a lot like when we 
played with Bob Dylan and Neil 
Young. It 's weird - you ' re in thi s 
presence of .someone who's been 
through so much and seen so much. 
You feel really humbled. I didn't gel 
to. hang out with them much, but it 
was a lot of fun . 
What can we expect from 
the Dave Matthews aand on 
this tour? 

You ' re probably going to gel a 
good show because San Diego is 
our third to last show before our

been on the road basically sinl.:e 
July with just a couple breaks. II 's 
been a rough lour. This is the very

Damn Yankees 
Lewis stars in touring musical 

By Kristin Madigan 
Staff Writer 

For five sh rt days, the San 
Diego Civic Theater proudly pre· 
sented "Damn Yankees," starring 
Jerry Lewis. When the 
curtain fell on opening 
night of Nov. 5, the 
patrons who packed the 
house were on their feet 
cheering. 

Based upon Douglas 
Wallop 's novel Tire 
Year lire Yankees Lost 
the Pennant, "Damn 
Yankees" is a song and dance musi-
cal comedy about striking a deal 
with the Devil. 

Joe Boyd (Dennis Kelly) is a 
passionate baseball fan who se lls 
hi s soul to the Devil (Jerry Lewis) 
to become the world' s greatest 
ballplayer. Through this dangerous 
bargain, our hero finds neeting 
romance, and is able to help hi s 
favorite basehall team, the Wa ·h· 
i nglon Senalors, cI inch the pen-

thing that was done differ-
ently this time around? 

Yeah, there was a lot more pro-
~lloti on for Ihe ulbum. There wa~ a 
lot more promoting, and a lot more 
rewrds printed and in stock. and 
we sj1Cnl morc tllne reconJing the 
actllal .tlhum ilse lf. 
What's different about the 
new album ilself? 

It 's pretty di fferent. I don't like 
it bctler or worse than any or our 
other al hullls, but it 's different. On 
thi s one, we ' ve got one more guitar 
player, and there was morc time 
spent record ing it. We spenl about 
one month doing it , whereas our 
other albunls were done in a week-
end or so. We reo.:orded in New 
York, and we did it with a friend of 
ours, ~o basically we worked on it 
whenever we fe lt like d~tng it. So 
things arc pretty differenl now. 
What's the situation with 
your drummer? 

There were the th ree brothers 
and myself in the band before. but 
Ed, our old drummer, quit because 
he has a fa mily 10 take care of. So 
it's ~till me, Richard [lead si nger 
and gui tari slJ and Richard 's lillie 
brothcr, James JguitaristJ . We do 
have a new drummer now, Pat , 
who's also Filipino, but hc's not 
their brother. 
Have you done any videos 
for songs off the album yet? 

Yeah, we did a video to "Yeah 
You." The video's kind of about 
running away from your lean" and 
constantly feeling like people are 
out to get you, like in a big city. II ' 
also, you know, thinking your 
fri ends are againsl you, basica ll y 
freaking out. bUI it 's all in your 
head - if you could gclthat in the 
video. 
Are there a lot of bands you 
like that are out there now? 

Yeah. I really like Low. I like 
the new Sebadoh album. But I still 
Ibten to the old Fleetwood Mac 
and etl Young slLIff, primarily. I 
al so like the new Beck record a lot. 
And there's also a band ca lled Fuck 
that I like. " 

nanl. 
Providing Ihe whole orne enter-

tainment expecled of a musical, the 
show was a little corny al time . It 
wasn'l long before the not-so·sly 

exual innuendoes and 
19505 hu mor grew a 
liule stale. Never-
theless, a gifted cast 
provided the much 
needed surge of ener-
getic enthusiasm and 
musical talem to the 
show. 

Especially notable 
are I he actors who portrayed Lola 
(Va lerie Wright) and Joe Hardy 
(John-Michael Flate) Together, 
their effort provided a hade of 
character and solid humor to Ihe 
all-too-perfect plot. 

Withoul a doubl though, Jerry 
Lewis was the man who stole the 
show. Lewis, an internationally-
renowned star of film and televi -
sion, plays the role of the Devi l

national tour of "Damn Yankees." 
At the age of 70, this produclion is 
hi s Broadway debut. Hi s com-
manding stage presence and subtle 
wit won the audience over. 

The highlight of his performance 
involves Applegate's second-aci 
tum, "Good Old Days." The scene 
allowed Lewis to step aside from the 

script and revi ve his cane routine. 
Spitting out a monologue of one lin-
ers and vaulting hi cane into the air, 
Lewis danced around the stagc as 
though Broadway had always been 
his home. 

The succe s of "Damn Yankees" 
is staggering. The tour is scheduled 
for engagements in Canada, Lon-

don, Paris, and Australia. Depend-
ing upon bookings, it may conlinue 
unlilthe year 2000. 

Strongly supported by the com-
pany, co-star Dennis Kelly says 
Lewis is a "fabulous" leader, and 
that "He's very gracious. Jerry just 
has so much fUll , it filters down to

ail Mary: two words that make 
the biggest NFL quarterback 

cringe. Sure, some use it as a last 
resort, but no one ever expects a 
receiver to be lucky cnough to pull 

off a miracle catch. A successful Hai l Mary this is 
almost as common as lightning striking twice. 

But last Monday night , lightning struck not 
once, not twice , but three times at the Murph, 
when the Chargers dismantled the Detroit Lions 
bcforc 60,425 Monday Night Football fans. San 
Diego's Bolts left victorious, 27-2 1, improving the 
Chargers' record to 6-4, and stretching Detroit 'S 
losing streak to four games. 

Everything that could ]o wrong for the Lions 
did, most noticeahl y in the second half. Quarter-
back SCali Mitchell , who passed five for nine on 
th.c evening, went down early in the third quarter 
after re-aggravating a rib Inj ury. The ailing offense 
was in .the hands of' backup quarterback Don 
Majkowski, who fumbl ed twice, was sacked twice 
and passed 10 for 18 with I 10 yards. 

The Detroit squad was also entering the game 
in the midst or a three-game losing streak, after 
losing to the Oakland Raiders, the New York 
Giants and the Green Bay Packers by an average 
of at least 10 point s. 

. San Diego, however, was baek in lOp form, 
With quarterback Stan Humphries returning to the 
helm of the Chargers offense aftcr a shou Ider 
injury forced him to sit out for three weeks. 

Humphries played an incredible game, as his 
statistics prove. The quarterback from Shreveport, 
La. completed 24 of 32 pass attempts and accumu-
lated 311 yards for the nighl. 

"We expect that out or Stan," wide receiver 
Andre Coleman said . "We didn' t expect him to 
come back and be rusty. He 's that kind of quarter-
back." 

The play that changed the face of the Chargers'

CHARGERS: 
San Diego finally wins at 
home on Monday night 
Cont inued from page 16 
game came right at the end of the fi rst half. After 
debates about how much time should have been 
left on the clock, the time was set to :02 with the 
score in the Lions' favor. 14-10. As the c lock 
ti cked down, Humphries looked to pass the ball 
from the 46-yard line for the final touchdown try 
or the first half. 

"The thing that I was trying to get straight was 
the onidals. We went from 12 econds on the 
clock, to two seconds and back to 10," Chargers 
Head Coach Bobby Ross said. "So I was trying to 
ee where we were t,i me-wise. My concern was if 

we Imade another drive toward the end zone] and 
we don't get out of bounds, we got a problem. We 
didn't have any timeouts, 
so we went ahead and 
threw the Hail Mary. II was 
luck." 

Humphries, with little 
defensive pressure from 
the Lions, searched for a 
fami liar Bolt in scoring 
position . He Spoiled two in 
the end zone, guarded by 
three Detroit defenders. 
Despi te the mismat:: h, 
Humphri es launched a 
long bomb toward his two 
rccei vcrs, and a hush fell 
over the stadium. 

"It was a tough 
catch, but I 
should have 
caught It," 
Charger receiver 
Andre Coleman 
said. "If JOU 
want to be a 
good receiver, 
you've got to 
make those kind 

Almost in slow motion, 
the five players jumped up of catche •• " 
into the air, grasping for 
the prized pigskin. The ball 
new over player after player until Coleman pulled 
down the bomb for his first and only touchdown of 
the game. 

The stadium erupted in cheers, and San Diego 
ended the lirst half provi ng they weren't going down 
without a good fight. After John Carney's successful 
extra point attempt, the Chargers recaptured the 
lead, 17-14. 

" It was a tough catch, but I hould have caught 
it. If you want to be a good receiver, you've got to 
make those ki nd of catches," Coleman said. "Right 
before I got ready to jump, I knew r had a chance 
to catch it because it seemed like all the other guys 
were already in the ai, and the ball hadn't come 
down yet. So I j ust jumped, and the ball landed in 
my hands." 

Coleman 's perfect catch was the climax of a 
tight nrst half. San Diego was on the board first, 
thanks to a 32-yard pass from Humphries to Tony 
Martin . With a successful Carney kick, the Bolls 
took the early lead, 7-0. 

Only three minutes passed until Barry Sa nders 
showed himself as a force to be reckoned with . 
Two Charger penalti es gave the Lions a 35-yard 
push up the lield, and ·Sanders carried the ball the 
fi nal two yards into the end zone. Detroit kicker 
Jason Hanson placed the extra-point kick perfectly 
between the goa l post" evening the score at 7-7. 
where it remained until the second quaner. 

I :20 elapsed before Sanders once again plowcd 
II yards through traffic for an ther six points. 
thanks to superb blocking by Lion guard Mike 
Compton, who pushed th ree defenders out of 
Sanders ' way. Hanson's ki ck was good, and 
Detroi t stole the lead. 14-7. 

The LIOns mi - ed a chance to increase their lead 
when Hanson missed a 53-yard lield goal wide right. 

Seven minutes and 14 plays later, San Diego 
had advanced on ly 65 yards. Ross ordered a field 
goal , and Carney delivered from 29 ya rds out. The 
defi ci t was cut, 14-10, but the Chargers still found 
themselves behind. 

That i , unt il the Humphries-Coleman Hai l 
Mary combination at the close of the ha lf, when 
the Chargers' reclaimed th ei r lead, 17- 14. 

" I think, more than anything, IColeman's catch] 
changed the Lion 's mentality. I think that really 
shocked them," Chargers tackle Harry Swayne 
said. "They had a pretty good fir t half and they 
shut down our run and look advantage of the 
penalties early. I think that last play when we got 
the touchdown really took [the steam] out of them. 

The game went downhi II for the Lions after that 
point, thanks to injuries and the Chargers' tough 
defen e. Sanders collected 16 yards in the first 
quaner and 25 more in the second. His total 
yardage for the third and fourth quancrs combined

ers as time ran out in the first half, setting the pace for their stomping of the Uons. Coteman's three catches for 63 yards 
helped Humphries throw for more than 300 yards on the day, as he completed 24 of 32 passes and three touchdowns.

SANDERS: 
Chargers hold 
Barry to 51 yards 
ContInued from INC. 17 
was only 10 yards iii nOl very 
impressive for a perennial Pro 
Bowler and Heisman Trophy 
winner. 

The Chargers, on the contrary, 
were Sli II on fire through the third 
quarter, as tight end Alfred 
Pupunu caught a nine-yard pass 
from Humphries for Sar, Diego's 
third and linal touchdown of the 
game. Carney booted the exIra 
point, and Ihe Charger increased 
Iheir lead, 24- 14. 

Unfortunalely, Pupunu 's 
game was cuI ~hort in the final 
quarter when he had to be carted 
off the lield with a possible frac-
ture of his lower right leg. 

"The boltom line is, we sti II 
have pads on and it's still l ion 
II in a violent game. I think 

we've gol to try to keep the 
major injuries OUI of it, like AI 
Pupunu 's tonight ," Salisbury 
said. 

That wasn' t San Diego's 
only setback in the fourth quar-
ter. Although Carney kicked a 
20-yard field goal perfectly 
through near the beginning of 
the quarter. his next try from 49 
ya rd out failed. 

The Lions cro sed Ihe goal 
line again with less than three 
minules lefl in the game, with a 
short , one-yard touchdown 
reccption by wide recei ver Brett 
Perri man, complemented by a 
va luable extra-point kick by 
Hanson. The last notch, howev-
er, wasn't enough 10 capture Ihe 
win, as the Chargers prevailed. 

"We haven ' t had very much 
luck at all , but we got a win 
tonight," Coleman said. "Hope_ 
fu lly, we can take thaI momen-
tum and build on it for next 
week and the weeks Ihereafter."

Continued from"age 24 
Chri stine Chi have already 
proven IhellIse lvescapableofthe 
la k by leading the {earn to 23 
wins on the cason. 

HI look for the senior~ to step 
up [in the playoffs"" McFarland 
said. "T ey have the bigge~t in -
veslmen in the team and have 
spent the longest time on the 
court . Our younger players have 
also performed very well thi s 
year. 

"S hannon Noonan ha been 
01 id in the 111 iddle, Dana Salter 

has rea ll y developed as an out-
side hitler and Sherine Ebadi 
has done a fine job taking over 
Ihe sClling duties after Anne Su 
got hurl. [ think that we ha ve a 
ni ce mixture of experience and 
agg ressive, younger players." 

Tn the week off between their 
rinal match of the regular sea-
so n and the start of th e 
postseason. the Tritons have 
been looking 10 heal up some 
bumps and bruises they have 
accum ulated playing out their 
grueling schedule. 

Ripken is nursing a sore shou 1-
der and has been CUlling down 
on her number of swings in prac-
tice in order to be at full strength 
during the weekend. whi le Chi , 
who hun her ankle, and Ebadi, 
who ~prained her thumb, both 
appear to be back at full strength. 
UCSD did receive some bad 
news when Su aggravated her 
recovering knee in practi ce, 
which limiled heramount ofprac-
tice thi s week. 

Even as McFarland tries to 
downpl;lY it. all eyes are looki ng 
toward a rematch agai nst Cal Lu. 
Based on the reccnl history Ihal 
the two teams have, the match 
cou Id be one for the ages. 

" If and whcn we get there, 
al Lu will h.:tough," McFarland 

said. "We hada wi ld match when 
we travekd up there . They 
packed Iheir liny gym with a 
loud. rowdy crowd. Wc ' re hop-
ing now the big crowd wi ll he in 
our favor." 

So don' t be fooled . This will 
not be an average weekend at 
UCSD. The crowds hopefull y 
wil l be at the volleyball match 
and not at the library.

li fe, playing each game with ascn ~of 
urgency, knowing it could be their

key, with 10ngsticksTimLcung, Keith

important turnovers. 

In the consolation championship 
against Claremont , UCSD saw lead-

on the goa ls of Eric Von luyters and 
Jim Yunker. This pUI them in the

The Men 's Ultimate Di ~c 
team gOlt heir season started thi s 
past weekend by hosting a one-

day preseason tournament. 
Teams showed up 
'<Q~ from all over 

....::::::::- Southern 
Ca lifor- niainciudingUC B 
(two teams). UCLA. Cal Poly 
S.L.O., Occidental. Clairemolll 
and Redland .. 

The UCSD Air Squids had 
an Iher intensive recruiting sea-
son with 28 new players joining 
the team. Due to the large num -
bers, the Sq uids split in to Ihree 
tcams of equal strength (X, Y 
and Z). Team Z went 1-3, team X 
went 2-2 and team Y went 3-1. 
which was good enough to ad -
vance th.:m t the emilinuls. The 
squids. however, went down to 

• Oliver Peoples 

• Colvin Klein 

• Matsuda 

• Armani 

• Mikli 

Sanl;! Barbara. 
The three-team format gave 

everyone, especially the new 
players. u chance 10 get in a lot of 
tournamelll experience. Many of 
the new players pl ayed inlegral 
parts in thei r teams success. The 
Slrong showi ng by all three team~ 
may be an indicalion of big thi ngs 
to come from I he Squ id: , espe-
cia ll y later in the season when all 
the ta lent can be pooled for one 
squad . 

Until then, the Squids con-
linue to build a bri ghl future by 
moldi ng the new recruil s. In two 
wecks, the squids will be bring-
ing two teams to a lournament in

through the wide and wonder-

" ful world of sports at UCSD. 
First, let's talk about the 

good ole' NCAA Divi ion III 
intercollegiate squads. " is 
almost common knowlege 
that we have our very own 
women's championship 
soccer team. OK, so it'll be a 
lillie hard to watch their next 
game in Amherst , Ma s. at 
the Final tour. As for the 
men 's team, they have a 
chance to play on UCSD soil 
if they take care of business 
at the Western Regionals held 
in Minnesota. If they win, 

¥: you may have another chance 
to cheer for the guys from La 
Jolla. 

Aside from looccer. Ihc 
women's volleyballtcam will 
be deep in postseason action 
Ihis weekend at home. Yes, 
fellow Tritons, here's your 
chance to redeem yourselves 
as fans . The University of La 
Verne travels to RIMAC 
Friday a\ 4:30 p.m. and it 
would be great if there were 
more UCSD fans than 
Leopard fans . Just this once. 

Another team who might 
play at home during Ihe 
playoffs"is the men's water 
polo team. UCSD will host 
the NCAA Final Four at 
Canyonvie.w Pool December 
6-8, and the Triton team has a 
good shot to be one of those 
four teams. So take a study 
break the week before flnals 
and go watch some water 
polo. I guarantee it's a fun 
sport to watch and if you get 
close enough, you might even 
get a little weI. After all, if 
you're going to watch you 
might a well get the full 
experience. 

As for the cross country 
team, they are in Illinois as 
we speak. The entire men ' s 
team as well as a few of the 
women, are runRlng their 
hearts out for UCSD. Your 
assignment with this team is, 
if you know any of tho e star 
Tritons, tell them congratula-
tions and give them a pat on 
the back. They deserve it. 

And if you aren't a big fan 
of NCAA sport , I have a fun 
and exciting alternalive: 
Intramural. Even the e team 
are up to their ears in playoff 
action. Whether you like noor

Wild West Showdown at RIMAe 
HIGH NOON: The stage is et for a UCSD and Cal Lutheran shootout for the Division III Title 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

On a normal UCSD weekend. a 
cry goes out from the apathetic stu-
dent body, "There\ nothing good to 
do on campus." 

But this weekend, top collegiate 
women's volleyball will invadecam-
pus as UCSD plays host to the NCAA 
Division III Western Regional com-
petition. This four-team tournament 
wi II feature the top-ranked women 's 
teams on the Wesl Coast battling it 
out for a chance to be the Western 
Regional Champion, and move on 
10 challenge for the National Cham-
pionship. 

This format is nothing new for 
the Tritons, who have established 

themselves as one of the volleyball 
powers of the ' 90s, as they return to 
the postseason looking for revenge. 
Last year, UCSD was eliminated in 
the championship match of the 
Western ReglOnals by 
arch rival alifornia 
Lutheran. 

Less than a month ago 
the team traveled 10 the 
Regals ' gym and suf-
fered a similar result in a 
hard-fought match that 
was pushed to five 
games. In that match, the 
Tritons lost the first two games and 
were on the brink of elimination 
before rallying back to win the next 
two. The UCSD rally fell just short 

aSJhe fifth game slipped away, 15-
13. 

Since the loss to the Cal Lu on 
OCI. 23, the team has not dropped a 
match and is riding a four-game 

• winning streak entering 
this weekend. 

ot wanting to get 
too far ahead of them-
selves, the Tritons are 
prepari ng for thei r open-
ing round match where 
they will face the Uni-
versity of La Verne at5 
p.m. at RIMAe. 

"We want to take our matche 
one at a time," Triton Head Coach 
Duncan McFarland said. "Even to 
the point of looking at one game at 

a time. La Verne played us tough the 
first time we faced them." 

In that match at La Verne, the 
two teams played each game close 
before UCSD pulled away to take 
the win . This time around , 
McFarland and company cannot take 
the Leopards too easy, because they 
might find themselves out of the 
playoffs. 

The other first round match-up 
will feature Cal Lu taking on 
Pomona-Pitzer at 7 p.m. 

As the Triwns enter the high 
pre sure of the playoffs, they wi II 
look to their senior leadership to 
show the way . Seniors Mieke 
Biesheuvel, Madelyn Ripken and
