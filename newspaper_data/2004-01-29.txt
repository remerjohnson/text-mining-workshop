UC sees drop in applicants 
Transfer applications still on the rise 

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

For the first time since 1993, 
freshman applications for the 
University . of California have 
declined in all but one of the eight 
campuses for fall 2004. However, 
transfer applications have shown 
continuous growth with a 5.7-per-. 
cent increase this year. 

UC Santa Cruz was the onJy 
campus that received a 7.I-per-
cent increase in freshman applica-
tions. Meanwhile, UCSD received 
4.7 percent less freshman applica-
tions, a slightly higher percentag~ .

Task force to 
look at faculty 
diversifica tion 

By SHANNON EUm 
Staff Writer 

In an effort to recruit and retain 
underrepresented faculty members 
at UCSD, Acting Chancellor 
Marsha Chandler has announced 
her plan to form a joint Academic 
Senate-Administration Task Force 
on Underrepresented Faculty. 

"In this decade of rapid growth, 
it is especially important that we 
maintain UCSD's tradition of 
recruiting the highest quality facul-
ty," Chandler stated in a press 
release. "My intention is to gather 
a thoughtful, primarily qualitative 
review of the policies, practices, 
outcomes, strengths and weakness-
es of our faculty diversification 
efforts." 

The task force, which is expected

than the systemwide 4.1-percent 
drop. 

"The drop may be tied to a 
variety of factors," UC spokesman 
Hanan Eisenman said. "There was 
a modest growth of high school 
graduates, and of course there 's 
the recent fee increases." 

But with the University of 
California already being asked by 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to 
cut down on enrollment as part of 
addressing the state budget crisis, 
the drop . in applications could 
have some benefits. 

"While we never welcomed the 
decrease in applications, given 

that the UC is being asked to 
decrease freshmen enrollment, a 
slight reduction may ease pres-
sures on the system," Eisenman 
said. 

UCSD Director of Admissions 
and Outreach Mae W. Brown 
agreed that the increased fees 
could have been a reason for the 
decline, but also stressed that the 
decline . has onJy been for one 
application period. 

"This is a one-term phenome-
non," Brown said. "Clearly the 
increasing fees could be one rea-
son, but there are a number of fac-
tors converging at the same time 
contributing to the decrease." 

International student applica-
tions have also dropped from 
3,796 last year to 2,414. Out-of-
state applications, which have 
been declining since 2001, also 
declined from ~0,390 to 9,360. 

This is the third year that the 
university has seen a drop in 
international and out-of-state 
applications. According to 
International Center Director 
Mary Dhooge, the number ' of 
international student applicants 
grew for UCSD last year. 
However, this year's decline may

Labor adivists ask 
UCSD to rehire janitor 

Undocumented worker 
now has legal papers 

By CHllmNE PAl 
Staff Writer 

Labor union workers and stu-
dent organizations are pushing 
for university officials to re-hire 
Alejandra Rodriguez, a janitorial 
worker who was discharged dur-
ing the summer of2003. 

~wo years ago, Rodriguez was 
fired from Bergensons Property 
Services, Inc., through which she 
had provided janitorial services to 
UCSD, for allegedly attempting 
to unionize her fellow co-work-
ers. UCSD later rehired 

Rodriguez, but she was fired 
again in July 2003 when universi-
ty officials discovered that she 
used a false name in her applica-
tion, according to Juan Astorga, a 
labor union organizer for the 
American Federation of State,

UC revises poliq for 
nondiscrimination 

The University of California's nondiscrimina-

Assembly Bill 196 darifies for the purposes 
of Califomia's Fair Employment and Housing 
Act that discrimination based on ·sex· includes 
discrimination based on gender, or a person's 
"identity, appearance or behavior, whether or 
not that identity, appearance or behavior is dif-
ferent from that traditionally associated with the 
person's sex at birth."

be attributed to more security restrictions 
and other variants within the mternational 
community. 

"The ominous news [with the state bud-
get] could be keeping people from applying, 
especially in California," Dhooge said. "But 
for international students, I know that there 
are more visa restrictions and there is the 
possibility of more charges that will go to 
the system that keeps track of international 
srudents in the United States." 

Meanwhile, the rise in transfer applicants 
is being attributed to programs reaching out 
to community college srudents. 

"The increase in transfer student applica-
tions could be because of a lot of aggressive 
efforts toward community college srudents 
to consider and to transfer to our universi-
ties," Brown ·said. 

The new Dual Admissions Program is 
providing more ways for students to enroll 
in the UC system by fint attending commu-
nity colleges. Through this program, high 
school graduates who are at the top of their 
class but unable to meet all UC require-
ments are encouraged to apply to communi-
ty college while being guaranteed a spot at a 
UC campus. According to Eisenman, the 
program is another way to deal with the lim-

its on enrollment. 
There has also been an overall decreas 

in freshman applicants from all ethnic 
groups, except for American Indian, Asian-
American and Latino students. Black fresh-
man applicants showed the largest drop with 
7 percent fewer applications. 

"As far as the decline in Mrican-
American applicants, we don't know why 
that occurred," Eisenman said. "But UC's 
outreach programs, which are designed for 
students, many of whom are Mrican 
American, and provided college preparatory 
courses - those efforts have diminished and 
are in peril due to budget cuts." 

UCSD received 1,242 applications from 
black students, compared to 1,417 applicants 
last year. 

"Clearly the drop in underrepresented 
students is systemwide, especially in 
African-Americans at the freshman level," 
Brown said. "We're concerned with the 
drops in underrepresented students and 
we'll continue to analyze the data and see 
whether the drops are consistent with the 
system." 

The grade point average of freshman 
applicants slightly increased in most of the 
UC campuses along with S.A. T. I verbal and 
math scores.

greatly admired Grantham. 
"He never complained about his physical 

handicap, and instead looked toward every-
thing optimistically," Ng said. "Everyone who 
has taken the time to know him will admit that 
Bradley had an aura of serenity." 

Another roommate, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College sophomore J.D. Hicks, echoed Ng's 
description. 

"Bradley was an awesome individual, and 
I think: we can all learn something from his 
life," Hicks said. "Bradley always remained 
remarkably determined and optimistic about 
life. I think that is very commendable 
because most of us would not be able to han-
dle half of the adversity that Bradley dealt 
with in his everyday life." 

Grantham, who was born in Fountain 
Valley, Calif., started going to school at age 
three. In high school, he was an honor srudent 
and spent time at science and NASA space 
camps as well as Boy Scout camps, where he 
became an Eagle Scout. According to his 
mother, he traveled to all sorts of destinations, 
including Las Vegas, the Biosphere in Ariwna 
and even the West Wmg of the White House 
in Washington, D.C. 

He also often visited Disneyland, which 
his mother said he loved, but enjoyed less as 

he got older because he was no longer able 
to go on the rides. 

"He thought someone should invent a 
seatbelt for all sizes of people," she said. 

Along the way he met many famous politi-
cians 2nd celebrities, including Sen. Barbara 
Boxer, Sen. Diane Feinstein, Marie Osmond, 
Tommy Lasorda, Jack Kemp, Bob and 
Elizabeth Dole, AI Gore and Bill Clinton. 

At UCSD, Grantham srudied Japanese, 
and, according to ERC Resident Dean Rey 
Guerrero, was very involved in the ERC 
community. 

"You could always count on him coming 
out to events," Guerrero said. 

Jordan Cross, Grantham's freshman year 
resident advisor, said Grantham was an "amaz-
ing" resident. 

"Having had the pleasure of being 
Bradley's RA and friend, I got to see a kind, 
compassionate person who worked harder on 
a daily basis than anyone [ have ever met," 
Cross said. 

Grantham, according to his friends and 
family, loved ani me, video games and TV 
shows "24" and "The Simpsons." 

His family asks that in lieu of flowers, 
donations be made to the Children's 
Hospital of Orange County or the Ronald 
McDonald House. 

Worker: Labor union pushes for UC not to fire undocumented employees 
continued from pagt I 

tion," Astorga said. 
According to Astorga, 

Rodriguez did not have the right 
documents to legally work in the 
United States, but claimed that she 
had by using her false name when 
she was being rehired by UCSD to 
work as a janitor. Univenity offi-
cials, uPO!l discovering the falsifica-
tion, discharged her according to 
policy_ Astorga said that the univer-
sity discovered the falsity when 
Rodriguez confessed it to officials. 

Rodriguez has now obtained 
documents to work legally in the 

United States, according to 
Astorga. 

"For her doing the right thing, 
she got fired," Astorga said. "We 
want to give her the opportunity to 
work because she is legal to work 
now." 

Asto~ga also claimed that a 
UCSD official had knowledge of 
Rodriguez's false documentation 
during the time of her re-employ-
ment in 2001, and advised 
Rodriguez to keep the false name 
because the university "did not 
have authorization to investigate 
the status of immigrants," Astorga 

said. 
University officials could not 

verify Astorga's claim. 
"We are not able to discuss the 

employment of specific employees 
... The university takes a look at 
these matters ve.ry seriously, before 
anything happens," Director of 
Labor Relations Michael Melman 
said. "The university does not take 
action without fully investigating 
the matter." 

Melman said that when workers 
hired at UCSD are not satisfied 
with a situation, they can file a 
grievance to the university. 1£ he or

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week ~t the Univer>ity of California at San Diego.

Student advocate bears 
important responsibility 
T he Jan. 21 amend-ment to appoint an A.S. commIssioner of 
student advocacy marks an 
improvement in the office's 
efficiency and should be 
welcomed as being in the 
best interest of UCSD 
undergraduates. 

Voters in the 2003 AS. 
elections overwhelmingly 
cast their ballots against 
transferring their authority 
to elect the commissioner to 
the AS. Council. However, 
undergraduates should 
know that relinquishing this 
ability is not a loss of power 
but a gain in the priorIties of 
student interest. 

The commISSIOner is 
responsible for representing 
and defending the case of a 
student no matter what the 
charge. The position is 
designed to be an advocate 
for all, not just for those with 
whom the commissioner 
agrees. The lone candidate 
for the position in 2003, 
Viviane Pourazary, stated 
that she would not defend a 
student against the adminis-

tration if she disagreed with 
him or her on moral 
grounds. The commissioner 
IS responsible for represent-
ing any student in a case, not 
just the "right" ones. 

Too often candidates are 
elected for their affiliation 
with a popular slate and not 
for their actual qualifica-
tions. The student advo-
cate's platform should not 
be about an agenda, but 
rather about being quali-
fied. The case in pomt is 
Jeff Boyd, who was 
appointed to the position 
after Pourazary's disqualifi-
cation. Boyd has served the 
students with integrity and 
competence after the coun-
cil decided he was the can-
didate most qualified to do 
so. 

Councilmembers are 
more familiar with the 
office's requirements and 
are better suited to choose 
its commissioner. College 
councils should ratify tKis 
amendment to better 
ensure the right person 
defends students' rights. 

Lawsuits cast doubt on 
Schwarzenegger 

A ccording to a prelim-inary decision from a 
superior court ruling 

on Jan. 26, Gov. Arnola 
Schwarzene~ger broke a 
state law durIng the closing 
weeks of the recall race 
when he took out $4.5 mil-
lion in bank loans to help 
his ironically cash-starveo 
campaign. If the court's 
decision is upheld, the gov-
ernor could be forced to 
pay back the loans out of 
personal funds. 

This comes in the wake of 
a lawsuit waged on behalf of 
the UniversIty of California 
Students Association, asking 
the court to overturn the 
recent reduction of vehicle 
license fees and block budget 
cuts - particularly to 
University of California -
in Schwarzenegger's 2004 
budget. 

The suit argues that state 
law allows for reduction of 
vehicle license fees only 
when there is sufficient 

money in the state's general 
fund to repay cities and 
counties for the lost rev-
enue. Since the current 
general fund does not have 
enough money to cover the 
defiCIt resulting from the 
cuts to license fees, the gov-
ernor couldn't circumvent 
the legislature and cut pro-
grams. 

The governor was advo-
cated as someone capable of 
fixing problems creatively 
because he wasn't a politi-
cian. Accusations made 
against Schwarzenegger's 
actions make it difficult to 
see him as a ~litical out-
sider capable of coming up 
with unconventional solu-
tions to serious political pro-
belms. Unless liis defirution 
of unconventional is synony-

• I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Letter based on 
wishful thinking 

Editor: 
The letter by Heather Flowe 

in the Jan. 22 issue of the 
G,umJill" regarding increasing 
student fees, and more generally 
complaints from all quarters 
about how budget cuts will affect 
them, is indicative of the attitude 
that got us in this mess in the first 
place. The attitude is one of "I 
agree the budget needs to be cut 
... as long as it doesn't affect me." 

The reason that it is so hard 
to cut budgets is because any 
time someone tries to lower 
spending on anything, there is a 
special interest group right there 
to malce sure its funding doesn't 
get cut. No one wants to be the 
governor who cut education 
spending, or cut cancer research, 
or cut medical coverage, etc. But 
no matter what it is you cut, 
there will be a shrill cry scream-
ing, "You can't cut this program! 
There will be dires conse-
quences, n etc. 

So to the people who com-
plain about spending decreases 
and fee hilces: What do you pro-
pose we cut spending on? 
Because no matter what you sug-
gest, I guarantee someone will 
be there to scream just as loudly 
as you, and offer arguments why 
tbtir program's spending should 
not be cut just as eloquently as 
you. 

We may never have a leader 
who has the political capital to 

make these hard but necessary 
cuts, all the while weathering the 
stonn of people defaming him for 
cutting "vitally important" pro-
grams. 

So, I suggest you do as I did 
and write the governor, thanlcing 
him for taking these hard steps, 
which will cost him politically in 
the short term, but that are neces-
sary in the long nm.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 2'1, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Koala critics cross with shredding antics on Library Walk 
Web--based survey's success will depend on honest student input 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

L ife on this campus is getting more and more surreal to this writer. Coming across a 
table comically festooned with far 
more "stop the hate" signs than 
environmentally justifiable, one 
had to question whether the paper 
shredder sitting on top of it was 
another joice played upon the cam-
pus community by the members of 
Tht /Will. 

Mer all, what could be a better 
stunt to pull on distribution day 
than shredding one's own newspa-
pers? After duly establishing the 
facts of who exacdy was manning 
the table, it became abundantly 
dear that the people with the 
shredder dearly meant business. 

Although they did not seem 
disposed to disrupt distribution of 
the KOIIIII itself, the Thurgood 
Marshall College students who 
took it upon themselves to run 
thar table have finally done what 
repeated beatings and four years·of 
reading the KDllIII have not: offend-
ed this writer. 

A shredder really has no place 
on any university campus. While 
it might be a tad hypocritical to 
get up in-arms about other people 
getting up in arms, the Marsllal1 

students really have crossed the 
line. 

A side note to the shredders: If 
your shredder was meant to pro-
voice debate and to draw attention 
to your cause, as a symbolic tool 
rather than a real disruption of any 
kind, congratulations. You have 
reduced yourselves to the level of 
the KDlliIl in shock value. 

There is a clear difference ' 
between criticizing a publication 
for its content by speaking out or 
writing against it and actively 
destroying published material. No 
doubt these bright young 
Marshall shredders have lost the 
distinction between the two in 
today's poisoned and partisan 
political environment. This writer 
will guarantee the reader that 
someone out there will read this 
article as condoning the KDtUtI's 
actions. In truth, he finds them 
disruptive, unnecessary and 
immature, but this is not salient to 
the point. 

In either case, the symbolism 
of a shredder is rather disturbing 
for anyone who respects freedom 
of thought. Yes, the KDllIII is crude 
and offensive, but at what point 
do the operators of a shredder 
arbitrarily decide what deserves to 
be shredded? Should we shted 
Mti" /Gzmpf, despite its obvious 
academic value? Or should we 
shred this article, for depicting 
the shredders as immature hyp-
ocrites? 

In a civilized university environ-
ment, there really cannot be any

substitute to the basic principle that 
all thought and speech have an 
equal right of expression. The dif-
ference here from the real world is 
that we should be intelligent and 
mature enough to give attention to 
what needs to be said and to ignore 
the garbage. If something does 
offend our sensibilities enough, we 
should write and speak out in 
protest, not destroy the publication 
in question. 

" There is a clear difference between criticizing a 
publication far its content 
by speaking ar writing out 

against it, and actively 
destroying published 

material. II 

While the best way to deal with 
this kind of attention-seeking idio-
cy (both the shredder and the 
KDtUtI) is probably just to ignore it, 
this vitriol can perhaps be justified 
because at least the KoIIiIl has 
aclcnowledged its own attention-
seeking demagoguery, while the 
Marshall shredder operators have 
yet to show that much wisdom. 

In all honesty, this writer 
believes that while there are people 

who are fighting to make the cam-
pus a better place for just motives, 
anyone who would resott to these 
sorts of shock tactics is posing 
amoral ambition as self-righteous 
indignation. Follow me, and we 
will cleanse this campus of the vile 
stench of hate! (That a mocking 
tone is implied should be obvious.) 
Great. Why don't you put on some 
anti-hate armbands while you're at 
it, and burn the next issue of the 
KDlliII on May 10? 

On the other hand, maybe not 
all of us are immune to bouts of 
shocking, self-righteous indigna-
tion every now and again. 

I t really is too bad the self-righteous rant had to go first, because the initial topic for 
this week, the MyUCSD portal, 
really needs student publicity to 
get some decent input (though 
that is assuming anyone reads this 
column - or this newspaper -
anyway). MyUCSD is an ambi-
tious project of the school admin-
istration to replace the venerable 
StudentLink portal with a new 
online page featuring not only 
class schedules, billing and regis-
tration, but also all sorts of good-
ies to help UCSD students stay 
abreast of campus news and 
events. 

The site is really in the most 
embryonic state of development -
at least, that is what is implied by 
the somewhat noncommittal 
responses given by Dr. Darlene 

Willis, putative lead on MyUCSD. 
While the newly re-christened 

(and patently unofficial) unvw.sdun-
censored. com aims to provide an 
online forum for UCSD students 
to interact meaningfully and trade 
information on classes and social 
events, a number of sites have 
attempted to provide such venues, 
notably www.ucsdproftssor.com (for 
CAPE-like reviews by individual 
students), and the UCSD 
Livejournal community (for, well, 
for something). 

None of the sites have really 
become effective at their task -
though not for lack of tacking up 
flyers allover campus - because 
none of them have hit critical 
mass. While a few hundred 
UCSD students might drop in 
every now and again, there just is 
not enough activity on any of 
these sites to warrant constant 
observation or ubiquitous involve-
ment. Unfortunately, unless Stu-
dents have a reason to go the Web 
page, they just will never find Out 
about it. 

As a result, it seems the only 
effective way to connect students to 
each other online is through a large 
and virj ble integration with online 
services students have to use such 
as registration, scheduling and the 
like. While the immediate goal is to 
provide Web-based information 
and services to 'complement the in-
person services planned for the Stu-
dent academic services complex,

Children are not emotionally 
capable of consenting to or dealing 
with a sexual relationship, hetero-
or homosexual. But since NAM-
BLA doesn't advocate violence or 
coercion of any kind, the ACLU 
rightly defended the organization 
from a lawsuit holding it responsi-
ble for the murder of a 10-year-old 
child by gay men. Such a case is 
much like holding nonviolent anti-
abortion groups legally responsible 
for clinic bombings.

ACLU up as an example of the 
Left's conspiracy to attack anyone 
with morals, he should have cho-
sen an organization other than 
one that has led celebra ted legal

THUIlSVAY, JANUARY 29, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 7 

Diversity: Minority students express concerns MUIR COLLEGE'S 
!'CRADUATION 

cOlUinued from page I 
to convene in February and finish 
its work by spring 2004, will work 
alongside Chandler, Acting Senior 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs David Miller, Vice 
Chancellor of the School of 
Medicine.Edward Holmes and Vice 
Chancellor of Marine Science 
Charles F. Kennel. It plans to inves-
tigate the faculty recruitment 
process, effective methods for facul-
ty retention, how quickly tenure is 
reached and whether or not there is 
a panern of overburdening certain 
faculty members. 

"There is a concern that of the 
ethnic minority members repre-
sented on the faculty, many are 
called on to represent various com-
minees in addition to fulfilling 
their primary obligations and are 
feeling overburdened," said 
Interim Associate Chancellor Ann 
Briggs Addo, who, previous to her 
appointment, worked as chief of 
staff in the Office of Resource 
Management and Planning. 

If the task force finds statistics 
or information that is not to its sat-
isfaction, it will seek to propose 
and execute ways in which those 
problems can be rectified. 

According to Addo, there will 
most likely be at least 10 people on 
the task force, constituting a broad 
representation of faculty and 
administration. The Academic 
Senate's Comminee on Comminees 
is in the process of receiving campus 
input and preparing nominations as 

to who will serve. 
The activities of the task force 

will mirror an earlier analysis enti-
tled the Gender Equity Study, 
which compared and contrasted 
certain trends, panerns and other 
relevant statistics of male and 
female faculty members at UCSD. 

According to Addo, students 
and organizations alike have been 
vocal about the shortage of under-
represented faculty members on 
the UCSD campus. 

"Students of color have come 
into the office and expressed their 
concerns that there is real shortage 
of minority professors," Addo said. 

In the January edition of his 
monthly online newslener, Chair of 
the UCSD Diversity Council 
Russell Doolinle expressed the 
importance of having a diverse uni-
versity community. "Universities 
should be more than centers of 
technological research and devel-
opment," Doolittle stated. "They 
are not mere conduits for the 
nation's work force. They must also 
serve as the conscience of our soci-
ety .. . We will not endure as a civi-
lization if certain segments of the 
populace are excluded from the full 
benefits of our educational system." 

Although many have voiced 
their support of the task force as a 
step in the right direction, some 
are skeptical about its ultimate effi-
cacy and the end results to be pro-

. duced. 
"I was on the board of the 

Diversity Council in the first two 

years of its existence, and hardly any 
changes in policy were implement-
ed," said Patrick Velasquez, director 
of Office of Academic Support and 
Instructional Serivces and member 
of the Latino/Chicano Concilio. 
"The people in charge need to be 
informed about the situations, and it 
is ultimately up to them whether or 
not recommendations are followed." 

The two most important issues 
the task force needs to look at, 
according to Velasquez, include 
trends in hiring practices and crite-
ria for the awarding of tenure to 
professors, examining whether or 
not biased patterns exist. He also 
believes the task force must imple-
ment certain measures to alleviate 
the pronounced racial disparities. 

"A mentoring system needs to 
be instituted in which the 
progress of assistant professors 
can be tracked and senior faculty 
members are available to help 
newcomers, thus aiding talented 
faculty members to obtain the 
tenure they deserve," Velasquez 
said. "We lost three excellent 
Chicano faculty members in the 
last four to five years. They were 
good academicians and great stu-
dent mentors, and yet they were 
denied tenure."

"There is a basic necessity to 
survive," MEChA member and Earl 
Warren College junior Magdalena 
Munoz said. "You need a job. 
They're not stealing from anyone, 
and it would be unfair to punish 
these people for basic necessities." 

Munoz said that Rodriguez'S 
case is a misunderstanding, and that 
individuals who support her cause 
also aim to follow policy. 

"She did turn in the right docu-
ments and she was fired," Munoz 
said. "Everyone wants to follow 
policy ... We all know there are 
rules and procedures." 

Munoz and Astorga, who are in 
contact with Rodriguez, both said 
that Rodriguez was upset that she 
was called a liar and that she needs 
employment. 

Rodriguez was not available for 
comment. 

MEChA iscurr;endy working on 
the project "Operation 
Travajadores," which addresses 
iss"Ues of Latino workers and short-
staffing. 

"What we believe in our organi-
zation is that we need to be involved 
in the community and our commu-
ni ty's issues, and I think this really 
implies and is an active example of 
it," Munoz said. _ 

Students for Economic Justice, 
which works closely with labor 
unions, is supporting Rodriguez's 
cause as well. 

SEJ member and Thurgood 
Marshall College junior Erica 
Kermani said she felt UCSD stu-
dents were not sensitized to work-
ers' rights. . 

"I think students have to reali ze 
that these people are not invisible," 
Kermani said. "We have this per-
ception that our school is clem, and 
we don't realize that there are peo-
ple who are actually doing it. There 
are people behind the scenes." 

AFSCME has also JUhed for the 
approval of an a~ent with the 
university whereby an employee's 
use of a false name or soc:iII secwity 
number would not lead to tennina-
tion. They hope such an agreement 

between the university and its work-
ers would lead to the open disclosure 
of any,false documentation of work- .. 
ers without fear of being fired. 

According to Astorga, the 
agreement has not been passed, but 
a similar agreement was signed at 
UCLA.

ARTS &' ENTERTAINMENT 

THURSDAY. JANUARY 29. 2004 

By DAVE BYNUM 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

There is one in every dorm hall and every apartment floor throughout America: a 
guitar leaning in the corner of the 
room when it's not in use. That 
which can be picked up and for 
hours, without ceasing, play an 
amalgam of top-40 hits from the 
past two decades as well as lesser-
mown favorites. On their braver 
nights, these artists will throw in 
something they wrote between 
Dave Matthews Band and Blink-
182 songs. The lost son of the 
dreamer and the struggling artist, 
these artists agonize behind 
closed doors to write the three-
minute musical version of the next 
great American novel. 

The San Diego acoustic scene 
has long been known for nurtur-
ing this specific form of genius. 
Jewel sprung out of obscurity 
after hitting the San Diego open 
mic nights for over a year. The 
legend of the acoustic scene more 

If I, 

recently drew J ason Mraz from 
across the country in hopes of 
using the San Diego music sub-
culture as a springboard to star-
dom. Jack Johnson calls San 
Diego his home away from home. 
Stories like these have helped 
make San Diego to acoustic music 
what Seattle was to grunge. 

The magic all starts on the 
small stage, at open mics allover 
San Diego. The average person 
can imagine no greater fear than 
bearing heart and soul in front of 
a room full of drunken strangers, 
but to the aspiring musician who 
finds himself doing exactly that, 
the dream of being the next big 
thing outweighs the fear of liridg 
a life void of taking chaDces. 
While there are a variety of 
venues that offer the open-mic 
experience, few offer an annos-
phere as conducive to the experi-
ence as RT's Longboard Grill in 
Pacific Beach.

album 

San Diego trip-hop outfit nya's popu-larity has steadily grown, garnering a San Diego Music Award nomination 
and drawing attention to their live 

shows. Their debut album, Poist is the 
Grutrr Arrhitea, a mesmerizing blend of 
pulsating beats, sonic soundscapes and dis-
tant vocals, shows why. 

Opener "Isola" begins with heavy syn-
thesiurs diat set the stage for frontwoman 
Blanca Rojas's icy drawl. Occasionally, she 
breaks free of the noise to allow for swoop-
ing vocal crescendos, but Rojas's vocals are 
often an afterthought to the noisy annos-
pherics. When audible, her vocals can be 
dramatically effective. On the album's cen-

The latest album from the garage-rock/punk/pop band the Dirtbombs is fairly original and entertaining in the 
sense that it is "ery disjointed. Dllngrrous 
Milgicill Noise is an orgy of musical enthusi-
asm, but ultimately fails to be consistent. . 

Their third offering begins with "Start 
the Party," a track that sounds like a 
screaming mess of hyperactive people in a 
stadium. The band might as 'well pretend 
that it has those kinds of fans by manufac-
turing them and putting them on its album. 
· It seems that each song has its own style 
- "Sun is Shining" sounds a little like soul , 
"Motor City Baby" and "Earthquake . 
Heart" sound like pSychedelic pop. while 
"I'm Through with White Girls" and 

Someone once described Metric "Rilo Kiley meets Postal Service," and it's just about right Metric's sound, to its credit, 
has elements of each. But the songwriting, 
often good but dull in spots, pales slightly in 
comparison . 

Metric's September 2003 release, Old 
World Underground, Where Are You Nuwf 
combines smooth, clean vocals, good oId-
fashioned guitar-thrashing rock 'n' roll , 
and electronic beats in a fierce mixture. 
With this record, Metric proves to be com-
petent sound stylists and composers 
unafraid of minor keys, both of which give 
the album a darkness well-suited to the 
sound it showcases. The band sounds and 
writes like a group that believes in hard 
work. In "Combat Baby," vocalistlkey-

reviews 

terpiece, "Blatchford," she turns the seem-
ingly meaningless phrase, "I ask myself, 
'How do I look? And does it matter?'" into 
a haunting mantra. 

The music isn't entirely distinctive -
think Portishead or Bjork at her least con-
frontational- but the band makes up for it 
by sounding active, brealdnJ the lull with 
unexpected noise explosions in 
"Disturbed" and male counterpart ~ in 
"I Want to Know." If the group keeps this 
up, losing San Diego Music Awards to no-
talents like Switchfoot will no longer be an 
issue. 

-BiDyGiJ 
~u HiImu FAir. 

"Thunder in the Sky" are the tracks closest 
to rock music. Interspersed with the J imi 
Hendrix-style screaming of lead man Mick 
Collins, Dllngerous delivers a very muddled 
noise. . 

In experimenting with different sounds, 
the Dirtbombs fail to give this album a 
cohesive quality. It's a shame that they do 
not stick to one style, since strong vocals 
and music gives them the ability to produce 
a solid album. This new record is decent to 
listen to if you are in a scrambled mood, 
but it is hard not to be left hoping the band 
will have more direction and be slightly 
more decisive in its fourth attempt. 

- NehaSingh 
Smior Stlljf Writer 

*** 
boardist Emily Haines pleads, "Don't go 
quietly/Said you would never give up easy," 
and you believe she's genuine. 

But the quality isn't consistent. For 
example, "Combat Baby" is followed by a 
boring number, "Calculation Theme," 
which lacks creative chord progressions, 
interesting instrumentals or a captivating 
beat. Even more unfortunately, it's one of 
several similarly unimaginative songs on 
Old World. Ultimately, it's an album with 
moments of near-brilliance, but gaps in 
creativity - gaps d13t stand between the 
album and one's ability to enjoy it unre-
servedly.

The sky's the limit for the 'Sky Girls' 
Cast s~ars while script struggles to ascend in this historical play 

By JESSICA VACHAL 
Contributing Writer 

Judith Hawking's portrayal of Jackie Cochran, founder of the Women Airforce Service Pilots 
program, is most notable among a 
cast of actresses who are the life of 
"Sky Girls," a play chronicling the 
final year of World War II's 
W.A.S.P. program. 

The cast has the obvious talent. 
Tying together the aviation leg-
end's gumption with her under-
standing of 19405 female stereo-
types, Hawking successfully char-
acterizes Cochran's complex per-
sonality. Her delightfully tongue-
in-cheek impression of a "femi-
nine" woman makes the audience 
roar. Sarah Rafferty's portrayal of 
Mags is another praiseworthy role, 
as she makes her character not only 
laugh-out-loud funny, but also 
endearing. 

Despite the strength of the act-
ing in this cast, Jenny Laird's script 
does not take time to round out her 
characters. Even the strongest roles 
remain two-dimensional as they are 
forced into a rushed development 
in the second act, crearing sudden 
chaos with the realization of their 
£laws. Supporting roles offer most 
of the comic relief, but are kept 
very one-dimensional . 

Laird's script does have a lot of 
heart, however, and the historical

lesson it teaches is clear. However, 
it attempts too much within a 
three-hour time limit and leaves 
most of the play's development of 
the play until the second act. 

In creating the staging for "Sky 
Girls," Russell Metheny cleanly 
utilizes his limited workspace and 
keeps easy spacing with his scenic 
design, using few props to make a 
visually coherent production. 
Sadly, Metheny's color scheme is 
yawningly monotonous, although it 
must he noted that he does not 
stand alone in creating the dizzying 
array of blues and beiges that lay 
siege upon the stage. HoUy Poe 
Durbin's cosrume designs are the 
other half of this color debacle. 

Durhin outfits the cast in a nostal-
gic swath of summer dresses, red-
slicked lips and high-heeled pumps 
when they are not in £light uni-
forms. These comparatively vibrant 
cosrumes, set against the blandly 
colored sets and inhabited by this 
excellent cast, allow the stage to 
come alive. 

While an enjoyable night's enter-
tainment, "Sky Girls" lacks a certain 
sophistication in its initially stunted,

Brit rockers Travis come to town 
Heartfelt acoustic songs are highlights of the show 

By JESSE KIVEL 
Staff Writer 

A sJanuary comes to a close, the boys of Travis will bring their heartfelt rock songs to San 
Diego. If you missed Radiohead or 
Coldplay, then you better grab a 
ticket and be prepared for that 
misty-eyed performance that 
you've been craving. 

Rising from the streets of 
Glasgow, Ireland, in 1996, Travis 
was quickly scooped up by Andy 
McDonald's up-and-coming record 
lahel, Independiente Records. 
After its first record Good Feeling 
was released, Travis began to create 
a small huzz in the world of music. 
Drawing from Oasis and 
Radiohead, Travis ' first album did-
n't set them apart from other 
British rock "n' roll acts because 
they lacked a signature sound. 

This sound was heautifully dis-
played on their sophomore record, 
The Man Who. Carried by brilliant 
song writing and simple clean 
tones, The Man Who thrusts Travis 

into the media spotlight. A full 
schedule of touring ensued and 
Travis soon gained a reputation as 
one of the best live acts around. 
The single "Why Does it Always 
Rain on Me'" gave them a top-ten 
hit in the UK and made the album 
one of the biggest surprises of the 
summer of 1999. 

After taking on the always-diffi-
cult follow-up record, Travis broke 
through to American listeners with 
The Invisible Band. Songs like "Sing 
and Side" reached American 
Billboard charts and gave Travis 
that often-unattainable universal 
appeal. Breaking away from com-
parisons to Radiohead, Travis 
inspired a new wave of UK bands, 
Coldplay and Starsailor being the 
most successfu~ in continuing 
Travis' tradition of chart-topping 
acoustic rock. 

Travis faced its toughest chal-
lenge in 2002, when drummer 
Neil Primrose seriously injured 
his spine in a diving accident. 
Primrose was forced to undergo 
surgery to repair damaged verte-

brae and it was a possibility that 
he would he unable to walk again. 
After making a mjraculous recov-
ery, Primrose was ahle to rejoin 
the band in the srudio to record 
its fourth album, U Mtmorits. 
Singerlsongerwriter Francis 
Healy explored the darker side of 
his talents on 12 Mtmories and was 
able to create a haunting and hril-
liant sound. Although the alhum 
at times lacks the effortlessness 
that made the past records 50 
enjoyable, Travis was able to 
expand its sound and huild off its 
previous effortS. If you disliked 
Travis' new sound, the hand 
always plays a heavy dose of its 
classic songs at concerts so he pre-
pared for a show that is as light 
and dark as all four of its records. 

Travis will play at Spreckels 
Theatre on Jan. 3 1.

Dramatic focus creates awkward film No need to be ashamed of 
'guilty pleasure' songs 'Resh and Blood' an emotionally intense, meandering documentary 

By nM SPULECKI 
Staff Writer 

"M y Flesh and Blood" is an 
uneven documentary that 
has multiple stomach-
churning moments and 

instances where images on the 
screen force audiences to look away. 
The documentary'S original pur-
pose was to follow Susan Tom as 
she cared for her 11 adopted chil-
dren who all have severe physical or 
mental disabilities, ranging from 
cystic fihrosis to mental handicaps. 
In the end, the film loses focus on 
what good Susan is doing and goes 
for shock value. 

The star of the documentary 
isn't Susan, but her adopted sonJoe 
Tom, who has Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder and cystic 
fibrosis, both of which took center 
stage during the filming. In the 
opening, Joe tells us he is going to

kill one of his sisters, which creates 
a disrurbing emphasis on Joe's · 
hatred rather than Susan's kindness. 
Susan herself can be seen as a sup-
porting figure of the film because 
she isn't very interesting once the 
initial shock of 11 children living in 
her house at once wears off. 

As with many documentaries, 
the camera is unsteady, but it is 
tougher on the eyes to witness 
some of the disahilities that afflict 
the children. Seeing burn scars

of praise than other forms of music. 
Weirdo soul-songstress Kelis has the 
best song on the radio right now 
with the atonal Neptunes groover 
"Milkshake." It's a little gimmicky, 
but it's also as daring as anything in 
pop music today. And calling some-
thing like Outkast's "Hey Ya!" -
truly one of the most formidable pop 
songs of our day - a guilty pleasure 
is completely condescending. 

Luckily for everyone, the past 
year has seen so many good "novelty 
songs" that critics have acrually 
started coming around. The music 
of Junior Senior's "Move Your Feet" 
sounds exactly like the music that 
occurs when you heat the level in 
"Super Mario Bros. " (You know

Narrow view: Joe Tom is at the heart of the documentary 'My Flesh and 
Blood: which focuses on relationships in a family struggling with disabilities. 

One thing these recent hits have 
in common with the aforemen-
tioned older ones is 
the music itself. By 
and large, these 
songs are pretty 
spectacular. There's 
literally something 
wrong with you if 
you don't like 
Beyonce's "Crazy in 
Love." What's 
wrong with you? It's

about.) Somehow, 
when taken with 
infantile lyrics 
about not stopping 
some lcind of heat, 
it hecomes great. 
The awesomely 

wonder how a child is able to sur-
vive. Learning about another's 
struggle with a disease in which the 
body doesn't produce enough colla-
gen to hold itself together is a real-
ity check on personal health and 
fomme. While the film may he 
intended to give Susan credit for 
dealing with these tough situations, 
the actual disabilities shown are dis-
turbing and lead to neglecting 
Susans role. 

Some parts of the movie are able 
to convey appreciation for Susan 
without the visual shock. Seeing 
that a "slow week" for groceries 
costs $600, or showing days when 
she has multiple kids in the hospital 
at once shows her courage. These 
instances are sprinlded throughout 
the documentary while the intense 
moments that rarely involve Susan 
flood the majority of the film. 

While Susan should be applaud-

I have a confession 
to make: I like the 

cd for her worlc, this voyeuristic 
docwnentary is overly focused on 
specific children who give the film 
its drama. Four of the children are 
given the most screen time, and the 
other seven are rarely seen or heard

The stories told here are mov-

from its original intent. It has a 
great premise, hut is narrow in its 
depiction and needs to broaden its 
scope to include the entire house.

talking about the fact that Beyonce 
is one of the most beautiful women 
on the planet. The Chi-Lites-sam-
pled horns are great, but Beyonce's 
attitude and terrific harmonies 
really make it move. The song is 
dynamite and should be respected 
as much as any other form of 
music. 

As long as we're on the subject of 
R&B, here's a quibhle: Why is it that

not that shit she did with Madonna, 
the "Toxic" song. J t's because it does-

Column: Pop songs aren't all guilty pleasures, but one mustn't forget indie rock 
continued from page I I 

on-girl action or "oops, I got mar-
ried" misadventures to get airplay. 

And then there's the Darlmess. 
Well, they art four skinny white 
guys/ four particularly hurtin' ones 
at that, but their campy "I Believe 
in a Thing Called Love" and the 
accompanying video and album 
have gotten just about every critic's 
attention. If you haven't seen the 
video, it's some nonsense about 
fighting a giant octopus in outer 
space and shooting lightning out of 
guitars. The song itself is a terrific 
Queen homage with a catchy 
power-chord riff, monster solo-ing 

and extremely high-register vocals. 
What's not to like? 

Plenty of illdie rock fits this cate-
gory. The Faint, who are now get-
ting radio airplay, really wish they 
were in the 1980s and in the Cure. 
They're not, but they're stiU pretty 
cool. The single may be called 
U Agenda Suicide" (I reQIiy hope thats 
a joke), and it does sort of remind me 
of wannabe Nine Inch Nails bands 
like Orgy ::..nd Stabbing Westward, 
but didn't we all kind of like those 
bands anyway? Didn't we own those 
albums? Maybe that was just me. 

Let's not forget about the Strokes 
and Weezer. Not the actual bands, 

the fake ones: Phantom Planet, 
Ozma, Rooney, etc. None of these 

" I can't handle seeing 
another good review of 

Evanescence. There's no 
pretending that they don't 

k " sue ... 
bands are any good, but there's 
something appealing about bands 

who copy not-50-original bands. 
There's no surprise whatsoever, and 
that's what's good about them: You 
know exactly what you're getting. 

Let's change gears here: 
Entertainment value alone is no 
way to judge music. When I see 
some critic's end-of-the-year list 
that has every novelty act under the 
sun but is noticeably missing bands 
like Grandaddy and the Yeah Yeah 
Yeahs, all these guilty pleasure 
songs do become a problem. Sure, 
I love the Darkness as much as any-
one else, but does ilS music honest-
ly compete with the low-key neo-
folk of Cat Power or the out-there 

hip-hop of Dizzee Rascal? 
Some of the songs in question 

just plain suck. Maybe you sing 
along to Hillary Duff, A Simple 
Plan, Bow Wow, whatever - but 
the music sucks. I can't handle see-
ing another good review of 
Evanescence. There's no pretend-
ing that they don't suck; they suck, 
and they suck a lot. Some guilty 
pleasures are just plain guilty. Take 
the Paris HiltoD video. Now that's 
just gross. Lers ,just hope:/we can, 
squeeze a good novelty hit out of 
her when she releases her album 
(there really is a Paris Hilton album 
on the way).

Tritons hope to take conference crown 

UCSD looks to bounce back from No. 19 finish 
By ANGELA UN 

Staff Writer 

Diligent, hard-hitting and 
encouraging - these are three 
adjectives that describe this years 
UCSD womens tennis team. In 
less than a month, the Tritons will 
be able to prove to themselves and 
to their division what they've been 
practicing so hard for. 

It 's been a year since the 
Tritons ended their run at the 
regional finals, and UCSD is anx-
iously awaiting the start of a new 
season and a chance to break the 
three-year pattern of finishing 
second in the conference. Last 
year, the Tritons finished the sea-
son ranlced 19th - their lowest 
ranking in Division ll. This year, 
the goal isn't just to win the con-
ference, but to go to nationals, 
finish in the top 10 and improve 
on their 17 -6 finish from last 
year. Detennined? Definitely. 

Led by its captains, seniors 
Julie Westerman and Kristina 
Jansen and sophomore Allison 
Ishii, the team has a wide range of 
experience, including six returning 
starters and seven talented 6-esh-
men. 

"The returning players have 
improved a lot and become physi-
cally and mentally stronger," head 
coach Liz LaPlante said. "'The 
girls are definitely competitive, but 
push each other to improve and 
work very hard. Also, the top 
freshmen have come in with a lot 
of talent and tournament experi-
ence." 

Junior Jasmin Dao also likes 
the teams freshmen additions. 

"We are going to come back 
stronger and more experienced 
this year," Dao said. "Our fresh-
men are all great players and will 
bring a lot of talent to the team 
this year." 

The Tritons are adding to their 
arsenal of talent. Earlier in the 
preseason, UCSD played in the 
Individual Cal Poly Pomona

HiP hopes: In the 2004 season, the UCSD women's team plans to snap a 
three-year streak of finishing in second place and move onto nationals. 

Tournament in October and in the 
UC Irvine Invitational 
Tournament in November. The 
Tritons finished especially well 
considering that many of their 
Stuter5 were unable to attend due 
to scheduling conflicts. 

The team usually travels with 
just eight players: six singles play-
ers, who also pair up to play dou-
bles, and two doubles specialists. 

The team is expecting to reach 
its goal, one game at a time; stan-
ing with a rune-up match against 
National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics opponent 
Alliant International University 
on Feb. 4 at UCSD. Then, on 
March 3, UCSD will face rival 
Cal Poly Pomona and then run 
into some tough matches against 
three strong Hawaii schools 
toward the end of the month. 

Dao also likes the energy of 
this fear's Triton squad. 

"We are a very positive 
group; at our practices we are 
always yelling motivational com-
ments," Dao said. "Half of the 
team is loud and spirited, and the 
other half is more quiet, which 
makes for a great dynamic." 

The team also has second-
year assistant coach Timmer 
Willing has helped the team 
build better stamina and strength 
on the court and also devefop 
their strategy. 

Ibis year will also mark the 
25th year of coaching for 
LaPlante. The team's strength 
not only lies in its talent on the 
court, but off the court as well. 

"Our strength is our team 
chemistry," Dao said. "We all get 
along very well. We're friends on 
and off the court, and we spend 
so much time together. We're all 
hard workers that just love to 
play tennis." 

No. 10 UCSD eyes national title 
Men's tennis carries five ranked players 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Sports Editor 

Although the UCSD men's 
tennis team lost three starters, 
the Tritons are poised to go the 
distance for the 2004 season with 
five nationally ranlced players and 
a crop of freshmen and returning 
players - which makes for their 
best chance at a national title. 

Head coach Eric Steidl mayer 
added two freshmen to his team, 
Seth Spector out of Fair Oaks, 
Calif., and Tyler Gipe out of 
Fountain Valley, CaJif., to help 
fill the void of graduated players 
Sean Nagel, Michael Meyer and 
Doug Holinann and senior Blake 
Wilson-Hayden, last year's 
starter who opted out of tennis 
this season. 

"Our freshmen have ability 
and are learning what they will 
need to do to improve their 
games," Steidl mayer said. "They 
are fitting in well, and I expect 
great things for the furure." 

Steidlmayer looks to every 
player on the team to step up and 
improve their games, especially 
sophomore Brent Molden, who 
has the potential to play very well 
this season. And with the depar-
ture of last year's captain, Meyer, 
the Tritons look to senior Jeff 
Wilson and junior Emil Novak to 

lead their teammates. 
Wilson and senior Sameer 

Chopra \vill pair up to play the 
top-ranked doubles fqr the 
Tritons. Their second-place fin-
ish at the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association Small College 
Championships last October 
earned them a No. 3 national 
ranlcing in Division II. The other 
two doubles teams are yet to be 
detennined, while four of the five 
singles slots are currently occu-
pied by Wilson, 17th-ranked 
junior Bryan Swatt, 25th-ranked 
Chopra and 39th-ranked Emil 
Novak. 

Chopra played mostly at the 
top position in singles last year 
and was voted Most Valuable 
Player for a second year in a row 
by his teammates. Swan, who 
previously won the 41-person 
singles draw at the ITA Fall West 
Regional Championships last 
October, competed mostly at No. 
2 singles and also paired up with 
Chopra last season to play No. I 
doubles. The Most Improved 
Player of 2003 is optimistic about 
the upcoming season. 

"This is the best chance we 
have to advance to nationals," 
Swatt said. "We have a bright 
outlook because we have older 
guys with experience who can 
help the younger guys." 

Emil Novak, who posted a 
19-2 singles record at the fourth 
and fifth slot, holds the school 
singles record for career win-
ning percentage. Wilson, like 
Chopra and Swatt, is a solid 
player who steadily contributed 
on the singles and doubles end 
last season, including a team-
high 19-5 doubles record with 
sophomore Tomas Novak. 

Seniors Sean Higginbotham 
and Amir Nejad, junior Nick 
Morton and sophomores Tomas 
Novak and Erik Oijala, and 
freshmen Spector and Gipe will 
vie for the final starting posi-
tions. 

Armed with nationally ranked 
players who have steadily 
improved their games over the 
seasons as well as remming and 
new talent, UCSD is looking to 
be a' force on the national scene. 
Team support, however, is vital to 
the success of the upcoming sea-
son, according to Steidl mayer. 

. "I think the key factor to our 
improvement is our ability to 
motivate each other, to help each 
other on a daily basis, regardless 
of our individual situations," 
Steidlmayer said. "If we do that, 
we will be great." 

UCSD's season will begin on 
Feb ... with a match against Azusa 
Pacific.

sprIng season 
ranked sixth 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

The Triton golf squad, which is 
currently ranked sixth in the 
nation among Division II schools, 
wiU start up its season on Feb. 24. 

UCSD has taken part in three 
tournaments so far this year, all 
during the fall, finishing second 
out of 12 teams, fifth of 12 teams 
and eighth of 17 teams, respective-
ly. 

The Tritons, who were not 
allowed to practice as a team from 
the end of its third tournament 
until Jan. 6, are back as a group 
again and practicing as normal. 

"Right now is the time of year 
that we're making sure we have 
all our equipment right - check-
ing clubs and grips and making 
sure everyone has the right gear," 
head coach Mike Wydra said. 
"We're also working on tech-
nique now. It is very hard to 
change any part of your game 
during a tournament run, so this 
break gives us time to make some 
enhancements. Finally, we're 
working on our mental game. It's 
hard to play your best if your 
head isn't in the right place." 

UCSD has three of its five 
starters lined up for the next 
tournament, senior Alan Scheer 
and juniors Joe Dolby and Brian 
Duckworth. All three have been 
nationally ranked at one time 
during this season, and Scheer is 
currently ranked l34th in the 
nation among players of all divi-
sions. The final two positions for 
the squad will be selected from 
the eight remaining players on 
the team, who will be chosen 
based on their performance in 
four qualifying rmtnds of golf. 

"We've already had one round 
so far," Wydra said. "Our final 
round will be held on Torrey Pines 
South, one day after the Buick 
Invitational. We will be using the 
same pins and tees that the pros 
use, so the guys are very excited 
about that." 

The Tritons will resume play 
on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24, when they 
compete in the Family Motors 
Invitational at the Seven Oales 
Country Club in Bakersfield, 
Calif.

By .IVCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The No. IS-ranked UCSD 
men's volleyball team didn't play 
its best match against Princeton 
on Jan. 26, but it played well 
enough to win. Two days after 
stunning Stanford, 3 -1, the 
Tritons came out flat and played 
down to a less skilled Princeton 
team that was able to steal a game 
from UCSD before the Tritons 
closed it Ollt 3-1 (31-29, 30-16, 
28-30 and 30-21). UCSD 
improved to 4-2 on the season 
with the victory. 

The Tigers opened their four-
game California swing at RIMAC 
Arena with the excitement of a 
team ready to get things started. 
The Tritons managed to subdue 
their opponents' enthusiasm 
somewhat with an 8-3 run to 
open the match, but the Tigers 
kept fighting and were able to 
close to within a point at 14-13. 
Princeton pushed several strings 
of points against ' the Tritons in 
the late going, and the Tigers had 
UCSD with its back to the wall at 
29-28. The Tritons responded to 
the challenge, however, and were 
able to bear down and grab three 
consecutive points to escape with 
a narrow 31-29 win. 

Game two showed the talent 
gap between the teams as UCSD 

came out poised and ready to keep 
Princeton from hanging around 
and keeping things close. Triton 
senior opposite Jim Waller had 
four of his 10 kills in the match 
during the second game, senior 
middle Kevin Keyser contributed 
three of his 12 kills and sopho-
more outside hitter Jeff Urton 
had three of his match-high 15 to 
help the Tritons eam a .391 to 
.077 attacking advantage for game 
two. 

Attacking percentages don't 
always tell the story, however, as 
the Tritons learned in game three, 
where they held a .269 to .067 
advantage in that category but 
were still defeated, 30-28. In a 
performance the Tritons would 
prefer not to repeat, they commit-
ted seven attack errors, six service 
errors and five ball-handling 
errors, but still had a chance to 
win. Leading 28-27, UCSD 
allowed Princeton to grab the 
next point and then committed 
consecutive errors to close the 
game, 30-28. 

Triton head coach Ron Larsen 
made sure his team was more pre-
pared in game four, and UCSD 
cruised, 30-21. Junior outside hit-
ter Adam Toren led the Tritons 
with 20 points on 14 kills, three 
aces and six block assists. Senior

Tritons go 1--3 at season--opening Michigan Invite 
Young women's water polo squad is off to one of its worst starts 

• , DANIEL DIAl 
Staff Writer 

After months of preparation, 
the Tritons kicked off their season 
at the Michigan Invite on Jan. 24 
andJan. 25 with sparks of anticipa-
tion that fizzled quickly with a 6-2 
opening defeat and losses to 
Indiana and Arizona State. Only 
an 18-1 besting of Marist saved 
the Tritons from an 0-4 start to 
the year. 

Despite showing disappoint-
ing offensive breakdowns and 
defensive lapses, the tournament 
allowed a young UCSD squad to 
gain valuable experience in game 
situations, which may help pre-
pare the Tritons for the UCSD 
Arena Invitational on Feb. 7 and 
Feb. 8. 

"We'll always be disappointed 
with three losses, but what was 
important was that we learned 
with each game and progressed 
throughout the weekend," UCSD 
head coach Larry Sanders said. "It 
was good for the team to play in 
some games, but now we'll really 
need to work." 

This optimism was a far cry 
from the Tritons' first-game jitters 
as they entered their opening 
match against Michigan. UCSD's 
new squad allowed the 
Wolverines, unchecked, to race 
out to a 6-0 advantage by the 
fourth quarter and to an eventual 
6-2 victory. 

"There was so much anxiety at 
game time, with the new team 
and all, that we weren't really set 
to go out and play together," 
senior goalie Stephanie 
Lombardo said. 

The UCSD offense did have 

its share of opportunities, but 
had trouble putting away goals in 
front of the cage, shooting a 
scant 2-for-30, and failing to 
convert on what Sanders called 
"at least three legitimate coun-
terattack" opportunities. While 
the offensive effort was enough 
to put up two fourth quarter 
goals, one from senior two-meter 
defender Meris Bantilan-Smith, 
the other from junior two-meter 
defender Lindsay Grossman, the 
defeat was upsetting for a squad 
looking for some solid ground. 

Some pressure was taken off 
the shoulders of the young squad, 
however, as UCSD recorded its 
first victory of the season over 
Marist, 18-1. Ten Tritons, led by 
freshman Natalie Hockett's five-
goal performance, got their name 
on the stat sheet, but more impor-
tantly, the relaxed pace allowed the 
Tritons to explore on offense and, 
according to junior driver Jessica 
Wong, "find new connections 
amongst [each other]." 

Against Indiana, the renewed 
offense held true, but it was a 
leaky defense that proved to be 
UCSD's downfall in the 9-6 loss. 
The Tritons played tough and 
held a 5-3 lead midway in the 
third, but the defense suddenly 
let up, allowing the Hoosiers to 
go 3-for-3 on power play oppor-
tunities and score four goals in 
the last quarter and a half. 

UCSD's chance to break even 
in the tournament was thwarted 
by a speedy Arizona State attack 
that, like the Tritons' other loss-
es, sped out quickly to a 4-1 lead 
and never looked back, posting 
an 8-3 victory. UCSD's three 
goals were overshadowed, once 

again b)'.an ineffective counterat-
tack and failure to convert oppor-
tunities. 

Despite one of the worst starts 
to a season in recent years, the 
UCSD squad left Michigan with 
an optimistic outlook on their 
game-by-game development of 
team play. The nervous, uncoordi-
nated bunch has slowly gotten the 
experience monkey off its back, 
contributing to a new attitude of 
"optimism ... moving forward, 
and [learning] how to build on all 

this," Wong said . 
But, according to Lombardo, 

optimism doesn't mean that the 
Tritons will take it easy now that 
some of the preseason pressure has 
been eased. 

"We won't be relaxed until we 
win," he said. 

The Tritons' next opportunity 
to prove themselves will be at the 
UCSD Arena Invitational at 
Canyonview Pool. Both Indiana 
and ASU will be part of the 16-
team field.

concludes 
home schedule 

By EVA HOFFMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's swim-
ming and diving team beat USD, 
196-10 1, in its last home meet of 
the season onJan. 24. 

UCSD and USD are closely 
matched crosstown rivals. In the 
past six years the teams have met 
three times at UCS D's 
Canyonview Pool and three times 
at USD's Sports Center. The 
home team has always won the 
meet. 

Last year, USD beat UCSD by 
42 points. This year, however, 
UCSD demonstrated that it has 
far surpassed USD, winning by a 
large margin and claiming 11 out 
of 16 events. 

"The meet was almost anti-
climactic," UCSD head coach 
Scott McGihon said. "It's been a 
pretty close affair over the years, 
and I think 'We've made some sub-
stantial steps forward that USD 
hasn't been able to match." 

UCSD took both first and sec-
ond place in both relay events. In 
the 200-yard medley relay, the 
top three teams finished less than 
one-and-a-half seconds apart. 
The first-place team, comprised 
of freshman Susan Bell, junior 
Rosanna Delurgio, sophomore 
Sarah Grant and freshman Emily 
Harlan, clocked in at 1 minute, 
48.68 seconds. 

Delurgio and Harlan, along 
with sophomore Sophie Levy and 
freshman Liz Whiteley, won the 
400-yard freestyl~ relay in 
3:35.41. 

UCSD had its best showing in 
the 50-yard freestyle, with Triton 
swimmers sweeping the first four 
positions. Harlan placed first in 
24.10, followed by senior 
Carolyn Kwok (24.76), Whiteley 
(25 .17) and junior Katie . Miller 
(25.31). 

Harlan also won the lOO-yard 
freestyle with a time of 52.90. 

Levy was another double-
event winner. In the 1,000-yard 
freestyle, she swam a lifetime best 
(10:24.84). Her first-place time in 
the SOO-yard freestyle was 
5:06.97. 

Delurgio won both breast-
stroke events, but she had closer 
competition than she has had at 
recent meets. UCSD senior 
Denise Bogard trailed her by only 
three-hundredths of a second in 
the 100-yard event, which 
Delurgio swam in 1:05.20. In the 
200-yard race, she and USD's 
Ashley Swart finished within two-
hundredths of one another. 
Delurgio's time was a 2:20.20. 
'. Sophomore Sarah Grant won 

the l00-yard butterfly in 1 :00.96. 
The UCSD divers also had a 

strong showing, against USD. 
UCSD junior Ashley Vogel 
earned the highest score on the 
one-meter board. Teammate
