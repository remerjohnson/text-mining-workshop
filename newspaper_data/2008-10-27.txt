$100,000? THAT BETTER BE A DAMN GOOD CUP OF COFFEE ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

Monday, October 27, 2008

Although experts remain unceratin 
about the impacts of the current eco-
nomic crisis on employment prospects 
for 2008 graduates, trends indicate a 
stagnant or declining job market that 
will only worsen for future graduates 
if conditions don’t improve.

“As the U.S. economy enters a 
recession, firms will lay off some of 
their existing workers and hire fewer 
new employees,” economics professor 
Richard Carson said. “Some of these 
impacts are currently being felt by 
last year’s graduating class at UCSD, 
but the situation will get worse before 
it gets better.” 

Director of the Career Services 
Center Andy Ceperley, on the other 
hand, remains optimistic. 

“What we find historically with 
downturns in the economy is that 
college hiring is the last thing to 
be impacted,” Ceperley said. “Given 
what we’re seeing on campus and 
nationally, projections for hiring are 
pretty close to what they were last 
year, though this … might improve 
or could become more challenging 
[as time goes on].”

The Triton Fall Job & Internship 
Fair last Wednesday hosted 145 
employers recruiting students for 
full- and part-time positions and 
internships. This marks a slight drop 
from the 174 employers that partici-
pated in last year’s fair. 

Conversely, on-campus interviews 
for permanent positions have increased 
36 percent since last year, with growth 
strongest in the field of technology.

“There is almost always a place 
for an entry-level college graduate, 

even when competing with someone 
who was laid off,” Ceperley said. “For 
college grads that are trainable, high-
energy and less expensive in terms 
of a starting salary, the college grad 
remains a favorable pool of talent for 
many large organizations.”

Despite bleak projections for the 
national economy, hiring for new 
graduates is not expected to decline 
dramatically in sectors other than 
banking and finance.

Stagnant Job Market Keeps Window Cracked Open for Graduates

By Justin Gutierrez
Staff Writer

After a year of deliberation, the 
Academic Senate’s Committee on 
Educational Policy has agreed upon 
new, more stringent guidelines for 
the granting of “Withdrawal” marks 
on undergraduate transcripts.

The new grading stratagem will 
allow students only one “W” per 
course throughout their careers at 
UCSD. Further withdrawals will 
result in an “F” or “No Pass” grade, 
depending on the student’s desired 
grading option.

Former CEP Chairman Kim 
Griest said discussion about the 
future of the “W” mark began sev-
eral years ago, when faculty and 
administration expressed concern 
about students withdrawing from 
the same class multiple times.

“Everything passed pretty easily 
with almost everyone supporting 
the change,” Griest said. “We [also 
conducted] a student survey, and 
found that the majority of students 
supported [it].”

Griest said the change in policy 
was not provoked by any specific

UCSD announced a new partner-
ship with King Abdullah University 
of Science and Technology in Saudi 
Arabia last week with hopes of devel-
oping research methods in scientific 
visualization and virtual reality. The 
KAUST campus is slated to house the 
world’s most advanced visualization 
facilities, making possible ground-
breaking research in areas ranging 
from solar power to clean water to new 
medicines. 

The Geometric Modeling and 
Scientific Visualization Research Center 
proposes researchers the opportunity 
to render interactive, 3-D visual experi-

ences from raw scientific data, allowing 
for progress in various scientific and 
technological fields. 

Under a four-year agreement, 
KAUST is committed to fund the 
partnership $8 million, while UCSD 
will supply the personnel to develop 
prototypes of new visualization facili-
ties. Additionally, UCSD experts will  
oversee KAUST contractors during 
construction.

The UCSD division of the California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology was 
approached by KAUST primarily due to 
its global reputation as a leader in infor-
mation technology and telecommuni-
cations, said UCSD Vice Chancellor 
of Business Affairs Steven W. Relyea, 

who represented the university at a 
meeting in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, earlier 
this month.

“KAUST is looking to build the 
most advanced facilities in the world — 
facilities that can be used by researchers 
in many fields to enhance their research 
— and UC San Diego is one of the top 
campuses in the world specializing in 
this area,” Relyea said.

The visualization technology will 
give scientists and engineers new insight 
into a multitude of technological fields 
by allowing for the examination of large 
data sets with interactive options.

“There are few scientific disciplines 
that would not benefit from this part-
nership,” Relyea said. “Computers and 
networking are changing every field, 

from biology to the social sciences, 
and researchers are increasingly deal-
ing with such massive data sets that it 
is almost impossible to understand the 
data unless you have a way to visualize 
the information.”

The proposed KAUST visualization 
system would create the most advanced 
visualization suite in the world, host-
ing the highest-resolution imagery and 
brightest virtual environment. Over 
time, this technology is expected to 
expand beyond the KAUST campus 
to research partners in Europe, Asia, 
the Americas and the Middle East. 
Similar facilities are also expected to be 
installed on the UCSD campus.

3D-Imaging Researchers to Set Up Shop at Saudi University

After an 85-day standstill, the 
UC Board of Regents approved its 
2008-09 budget last week making 
sweeping cutbacks and — despite 
increasing UC operational costs 
— providing less overall funding 
than last year.

The state operating budget for 
the university totals $3.03 billion, 
down from $3.32 billion in 2007-08.

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said 

the regents’ approval — which 
arrives weeks after the beginning 
of the academic year — is later than 
usual due to the delay of the final-
ized state budget, signed by Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger on Sept. 23 
a record 85 days late.

“It’s common practice to adjust 
the [UC] budget to reflect the final 
budget,” Vazquez said. 

Due to cost increases resulting 
from salary hikes, record student 
enrollment and other inflated costs 
such as utilities, the university will 
be forced to dip into internal sav-
ings to cover a $100 million short-
fall. 

Another $48 million, deficits 
accumulated from last year’s state 
cutbacks, will also need to be drawn 
from internal savings to compen-

Decreased state funds 
will force university to 
tap internal savings, 
postpone key staffing, 
compensation initiatives.

Post-grad hiring somewhat 
insulated from effects of 
nationwide layoffs and a 
lackluster economy.

Alleged abuse of late

administration to adopt 
stricter conditions for

Thanks to a recent $1.6 million 
grant from the U.S. Office of Naval 
Research, nanoengineering profes-
sor Joseph Wang from the UCSD 
Jacobs School of Engineering will 
lead a project to develop a “field 
hospital on a chip” for soldiers on 
the battlefield.

The system will monitor soldiers’ 
sweat, tears and blood for signs of 
trauma, shock, brain injury, fatigue 
and other medical conditions, then 
automatically administer necessary 
medication before they reach a hos-
pital.

“Since the majority of battlefield 
deaths occur within the first 30 min-
utes after injury, rapid diagnosis and 
treatment are crucial for enhancing 
the survival rate of injured soldiers,” 
Wang said.

The system will be minimally 
invasive and utilize recent “enzyme 
logic” breakthroughs that measure 
biomarkers and outline the steps 
necessary to make diagnoses based 
on biological variables.

“Developing an effective inter-
face between complex physiological 
processes and implantable devices 
could have a broader biomedical 
impact, providing autonomous, indi-
vidual, ‘on-demand’ medical care, 
which is the goal of the new field of 
personalized medicine,” Wang said.

The UCSD School of Medicine 
will lend a hand in the advance-
ment of neuroscience research by 
providing better access to public 
data and tools under a new contract 
with the National Institutes of Health, 
announced Oct. 24.

The school will oversee 
the Neuroscience Information 
Framework, an online inventory of  
data, resources and tools available 
to students, scientists and anyone 
with Internet access.

Along with co-principal investiga-
tors Jeffrey Grethe and Amarnath 
Gupta, UCSD professor of neurosci-
ence Maryann Martone will lead a 
collaborative project with research-

ers at Yale University, the California 
Institute of Technology, George 
Mason University and Washington 
University.

“With this new contract, we are 
deploying an open framework for 
use by scientists at all levels, as 
well as the general public,” Martone 
said.

The contract — an initiative of 
NIH’s Blueprint for Neuroscience 
Research valued at up to $10 million 
over the next five years — aims to 
integrate expertise from the fields of 
neuroscience, information technolo-
gies and knowledge management to 

enhance and maintain the NIF.
“The Neuroscience Information 

Framework is a vital component of 
the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience 
Research,” said Nora Volkow, direc-
tor of the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse and a member of the cooper-
ative Blueprint effort. “It is a pioneer-
ing endeavor to meet the enormous 
challenge of enabling neuroscien-
tists to discover and share the ever-
mounting, diverse inventory of tools, 
data, resources and knowledge gen-
erated through the Blueprint and 
neuroscience research efforts world-
wide.”

CURRENTS

A news story published Monday, Oct. 20 titled “New Center Would 
Focus Green Effort on Campus” incorrectly stated that the annual 
budget for the planned Sustainability Resource Center is $85,400. In 
fact, the project relies on $40,000 from the pending A.S. Council fee 
referendum and $150,000 from the UCSD Business Affairs Office.

According to the latest report from 
the National Association of Colleges 
and Employers, revised hiring projec-
tions find that employers now expect 
their college hiring rates to stay even 
with last year’s levels, with some vari-
ation across industries. 

“Overall, hiring looks flat for now 
and some employers are indicating 
some movement to cut back,” said 
Marilyn Mackes, executive director of 
NACE. “Many of this year’s graduates 
will find fewer openings available to 
them and may have to consider dif-
ferent types of opportunities, indus-
tries and organizations than they 
planned.”

According to NACE, the only field 
to see an increase in hiring expecta-
tions for the class of 2009 is govern-
ment. Hiring in manufacturing and 
professional services is predicted  to 
remain essentially flat, while all other 
industry categories are expected to 
see a decline in hiring rates.

“It is hard to see any real bright 
spots right now in terms of hir-
ing,” Carson said. “The picture will 
become clearer over the next couple 
of months as the financial crisis set-
tles down and some sectors start to 
recover quicker than others.”

Based on his observation of last 
week’s career fair, however, Ceperley 

expects to see a multitude of oppor-
tunities for graduating students with 
skills coveted by technology firms.

“Industries are still going gang 
buster in entry-level hiring,” he said. 
“Technology firms and high-tech com-
panies continue to do very, very well.”

A February report published by 
NACE shows engineering services 
and accounting firms as expressing 
the greatest interest in recent gradu-
ates. Consulting, retail and petro-
leum-product companies, many of 
which offer substantial starting sala-
ries, are also looking at college gradu-
ates as potential hiring candidates. 

Although the report indicates that 
employers continue to express inter-
est in graduates from a variety of 
disciplines, Ceperley warns that this 
is not the year for students to sit back 
and wait for employers to find them.

“Many students in the arts and 
humanities will need to be especially 
creative in their job search, focusing 
heavily on employment areas where 
their broad-based skills in communi-
cation, creativity and analysis can be 
fully utilized,” he said. 

Echoing a trend that has occurred in 
previous economic downturns, many 
students anxious about entering a chal-
lenging job market choose to pursue 
graduate school instead. Although final 
application numbers aren’t yet avail-

able, many schools  — especially busi-
ness schools — have reported a sharp 
increase in applicant interest. 

The Law School Admissions 
Council has seen a 15-percent 
increase in the number of LSAT 
examinations administered since last 
year, and officers for Kaplan Test Prep 
& Admissions report a sharp enroll-
ment increase in Master of Business 
Administration programs and 
Graduate Management Admissions 
Test practice courses.

Ceperley explained that although 
a graduate degree may up a graduate’s 
chances of success in the increasing-
ly competitive job market, students 
should not pursue graduate school 
simply to avoid a sour economy.

“Getting out there and getting 
experience with your UCSD degree is 
a much better strategy than going to 
graduate school to wait out the econo-
my, unless the advanced degree is actu-
ally a thoughtful decision,” he said. “By 
being proactive with their search, net-
working with UCSD alumni in fields 
of interest, pursuing internships before 
graduation and being flexible in their 
pursuit of their first destination job, all 
our graduating students can land suc-
cessfully into the workplace.”

Dr. Richard L. Sherman

sate for the lack of state funds.
UC President Mark G. Yudof 

said he is disappointed with the 
“bare bones” budget, which he said 
does not account for a number of 
the UC system’s top priorities. He 
said the regents are concerned that 
the budget does not account for 
enrollment growth, improvement 
of the faculty-to-student ratio or 
restoration of competitive compen-
sation for faculty and staff.

Yudof said the regents are also dis-
appointed that Schwarzenegger’s line-
item veto reduced 
state appropriations 
for labor research 
by $5 million.

“After years 
of falling state 
investment in 
inflation-adjusted 
terms, the uni-
versity’s true need 
for additional 
resources is well 
over $1 billion,” 
he said. “While 
we understand the 
state’s immedi-
ate financial con-
straints, strong 
long-term invest-
ment in higher 
education is critical to California.”

Yudof added that despite the 
7-percent educational fee and 10-
percent registration fee increases 
approved in May and the $28 mil-
lion in cuts from the UC Office of 
the President included in the budget, 
additional reductions will be needed 
to sustain the UC system.

“It is evident that the turmoil 
in the international and national 
equity, housing and credit markets 
will cause continuing erosion in the 
state’s economy,” he said. “As such, 
we must view this budget as just 
the beginning of potential further 
state budget reductions this year or 
next year.” 

Yudof also advised individual 

campuses — which are working to 
reduce the funding gap through 
cuts — to guard instructional and 
preparational student programs. 
The 10 UC campuses have been 
advised to cut back on hiring as well 
as travel and consulting services, as 
UCOP is currently doing. Reducing 
energy costs by increasing efficien-
cy is also a major component of the 
systemwide plan, he said.

Despite the financial challenges 
that the university currently faces, 
some areas of spending were actually 
expanded in the new budget. Student 

mental health ser-
vices and financial 
support for gradu-
ate students will 
grow, and student 
fee increases will be 
reduced or elimi-
nated for students 
who meet federal 
low-income stan-
dards.

Although the 
new budget is 
roughly equiva-
lent to a 5-percent 
cutback in state 
support and more 
reductions are 
looming, Vazquez 
said students 

should not worry about fee increases 
just yet.

“I think it would be premature 
to talk about [increases],” he said. 
“The regents have to start discuss-
ing their priorities.”

According to Yudof, the final 
spending plan is far from finished. 
California legislators may revisit 
this year’s state budget in January, 
which would in turn affect the UC 
budget. He said the regents will con-
tinue to push for state investment in 
education and research, which they 
believe to be potential factors in the 
state’s economic recovery.

Student Fee Increases Not Sufficient 
to Cover University Expenses

▶ BUDGET, from page 1

“KAUST and Cal-(IT)2 share a 
common interest in using new technol-
ogy to tear down the traditional walls 
between scientists, disciplines and even 
countries,” said Ramesh Rao, director 
of the UCSD division of Cal-(IT)2  and 
professor of electrical and computer 
engineering at the Jacobs School of 
Engineering.

Relyea similarly commended the 
multinational partnership. 

“The university recognizes that 
higher education, especially in science 
and technology, is now global, and 
these partnerships benefit both coun-
tries and societies by minimizing the 
barriers to new knowledge,” he said. 

The new research center will be 
enhanced with the capability to digi-
tally record sessions from each of the 
facility’s displays in high definition, 
and will feature a first-of-its-kind audio 
system designed in collaboration with 
UCSD and professional sound manu-
facturer Meyer Audio.

“The combination of all the sys-
tems together makes a statement to 
the rest of the world that KAUST is 
committed to providing the ultimate 
scientific visualization suite anywhere 
on the planet,” KAUST interim Chief 
Information Officer Majid Al-Ghaslan 
said.

Potential applications for the new 
visualization technology include 
nanoscale observation of inner-cell 
activity, helpful in devising new ways of 
transporting medicine, and the creation 
of earthquake simulations to measure 
how buildings react to seismic tremors, 
crucial to formulating new construc-
tion techniques and materials.

KAUST is currently being con-
structed in Saudi Arabia as an inter-
national, graduate-level research uni-

incident, but in response to pro-
fessors and lecturers troubled by 
the rate at which students enroll 
in classes only to withdraw after 
the add/drop deadline has passed, 
thereby preventing waitlisted stu-
dents from enrolling in the class.

Throughout the year, the CEP 
examined the withdrawal policies 
of various peer universities, such 
as UC Berkeley and UC Irvine, 
to determine an appropriate set of 
rules for UCSD. 

Both Berkeley and Irvine require 
students to petition in order to with-
draw, whereas UCSD has allowed 
students the 
freedom to drop 
classes, with their 
GPAs unaffected, 
until the end of 
ninth week.

Rather than 
requiring a writ-
ten withdrawal 
request from stu-
dents, the CEP 
decided to leave 
students with the 
freedom to drop 
late in the quar-
ter. 

However, the drop privilege is 
now allowed only once per course, 
a requirement meant to stress to 
students the significance of their 
decision to withdraw.

Earl Warren College junior 
Matthew Goodsell predicted that 
the new, stricter policy will have a 
positive influence on the student 
body. 

“The change doesn’t really affect 
me,” Goodsell said. “If anything, it 
was a long time coming. It teaches 
that you must have discipline at a 
prestigious university.”

Thurgood Marshall College junior 
Audrey Wang said the new policy 
serves as a necessary check against 
abuse of the withdrawal option.

“I think people who are con-
stantly withdrawing from one class 

don’t give a crap about school in 
the first place,” Wang said. “How 
can you not know if you are going 
to drop until that late in the quar-
ter?”

Sixth College senior Ganesa 
Sabaj, however, claims to have 
found a drawback to the new 
change: Interdisciplinary majors, 
such as those in Interdisciplinary 
Computing in the Arts, often require 
students to take courses from oppo-
site fields of study, such as visual 
arts and computer science. 

Sabaj said that students within 
her major sometimes struggle with 
these more science-oriented cours-

es, and that they 
depend on the 
“W” as a means 
of safely dropping 
courses.

“I think the 
change is kind 
of harsh,” Sabaj 
said. “It seems 
like the university 
has decided to go 
from one extreme 
to another. I think 
something like a 
‘three strikes’ poli-
cy seems more like 

the middle way.”
According to Academic Senate 

regulations, the only exception to 
the new policy will be cases in 
which a course is given an “In 
Progress” mark. This status allows 
students to finish a course beyond 
a normal quarter timeframe, and 
transforms into a grade once the 
course is completed.  

“IP” grades require a stringent 
petition conducted by the Academic 
Senate, which asks students to explain 
why they need additional time to 
complete the class in question.  

The new policy will not affect 
multiple “W” marks received in 
classes prior to Fall Quarter 2008.

We’re Not 
All Joe the 
Plumber

Lax Council Can’t Afford This Experiment
By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

A.S. COUNCIL — How long do we 
have to wait for some accountability? 
The A.S. Council’s lack of oversight 
for its own endeavors is astounding, 
and there’s apparently nothing that 
can shake this sleeping giant. Even 
as the council faces an epic bud-
get meltdown that has its program-
ming office scrambling to fund the 
Sun God Festival — easily the most 
important event of the year — coun-
cilmembers continue to table discus-
sion of an impending referendum. 
But that’s the routine. Year after year 
we see councilmembers spend hours 
fighting over Robert’s Rules and 
hypothetical technicalities, ask the 
prominent campus administrators 
who visit them — like Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox or Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Penny Rue — silly 
what’s-your-favorite-ice-cream-type 
questions, screw up much-loved 
concerts like FallFest and Sun God 
and throw money around careless-
ly to whoever whines the loudest. 
Unfortunately for the over 22,000 
undergraduates these councilmem-
bers are purported to represent, 
none of this lazy power tripping 
makes for effective governing.

When it comes to the Grove Caffe 
— an A.S. enterprise that is now 
over $100,000 in debt — the story is 
sadly the same. Rather than address 
the cafe’s woes, council after council 
ignored the failing enterprise, allow-
ing it to slip into a $24,000 hole. 
Former partial-owner Ron Carlson 
saw the writing on the wall and 
split, leaving the council, and there-
fore the students, fully responsible 
for the Grove’s debt. The 2006-07 
council finally took notice, and ini-
tially discussed cutting its losses 
and shutting the glorified coffee 
cart down. But disgruntled employ-
ees came clamoring, and true to 
form the council decided against 
all logic to hire an outside manager, 
Cleveland Thomas, to help save the 
dying Grove. 

(Forget for a moment that 
a large argument voiced in favor 
of the Grove was that it suppos-
edly provided business experience 
to its student managers, and that 
with an outside manager employees 

are developing the same skills they 
could in any food service position: 
cleaning, making coffee and working 
a register.)

For a moment, all seemed well 
with the world. Grove enthusiasts 
— all 10 of them — got to keep their 
beloved cafe, Thomas was basically 
given free reign over the enterprise 
and the council of procrastinators 
pushed the issue to the back of its 
collective conscious for at least 
another year. 

Oops. Now it’s fall 2008, the 
Grove’s debt — the initial $24,000 
of which took years to accumulate 
— has quadrupled to over $100,000 
in less than a year since Thomas’ 
arrival, none of the Grove’s loud-
est employee supporters even work 
there anymore and councilmembers 
are still twiddling their thumbs over 
in Price Center Ballroom.  

Now the council — led by Naasir 
Lakhani, the A.S. vice president of 
finance and resources who, appar-
ently totally confused about the point 
of his job and of a council enterprise, 
has repeatedly proclaimed that it’s 
not important for the Grove to turn 
a profit — is getting ready to gift this 
costly mess to next year’s student 
government sloths. According to 
Lakhani, the council is using this as 
an evaluation year because last year’s 
construction hampered sales. He 
hopes that with improved advertis-
ing and a revamped menu the Grove 
will start pulling out of the red. 

But wasn’t last year supposed to 
be an evaluation? That’s what coun-
cilmembers said at the time. And 
while it’s true construction definitely 
hurt business for all the shops in 
the area — like the Bike Shop, Food 
Co-op, General Store Co-op and 
Groundwork Books — none of them 
lost anywhere near the more than 
$80,000 that the Grove did. Last 
year marked the finish of a Student 
Center renovation project that start-
ed back when the Grove was barely 
dipping into the red, long before 
Thomas was ever hired. To attri-
bute such massive financial failure to 
the construction inconveniences the 
Grove faced is a joke. 

And while adding new menu 
features might create excitement 

Online Test Bank Levels Academic Playing Field

By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

STUDENT LIFE — With UCSD’s 
growing awareness of PostYourTest.
com, gone is the demand for teen-
sex-comedy stunts in which coveted 
test booklets must be snatched from 
moving university vehicles, in which 
brown-nosing TAs must be roofied 
into handing over multiple-choice 
answers. Once again, the age of at-
your-service Internet has stepped in to 
stamp out all those classic college joys 
(hell, even campus gossip has been 
relegated to a web of invisible torrents) 
by saving us the dirty work in short-
cutting our way through finals.

The Web site, created one year 
ago by St. Louis University graduate 

student and UCSD alumnus Demir 
Oral and now operating almost solely 
on contributions from UCSD, takes 
us one more step of the way to com-
plete digital resourcing (foreshadow-
ing a day when the entire contents 
of Geisel Library will be backed up 
on WebCT and discussion sessions 
merely broadcasted by video over the 
Internet, so that a four-year college 
career can essentially be spent in a 
La-Z-Boy with a laptop). For a small 
reward, students and professors post 
past exams as a study tool for stu-
dents currently enrolled in those tests’ 
courses, providing an equal, if morally 
questionable, study opportunity for 
all crammers come finals week. 

“Animal House” nostalgia and mil-
lenium boo-hoos aside, the projection 
of our every human and academic 
facet to the Web is not something 
we have the option to avoid. Almost 
200 UCSD professors demanded their 
tests be banned from Oral’s Web site. 
But no matter how we wear ourselves 
out fighting the universal availabil-
ity of copyrighted resources — and 

every artistically crafted test ques-
tion included on PostYourTest.com 
does technically belong to the profes-
sor behind the paintbrush — such 
widely relevant and coveted material 
will always weasel its way back into 

the hands of the people. Especially 
in the case of acquiring, say, one’s o-
chem midterm, which somehow fails 
to inspire the already minute pang 
of guilt one might feel when ille-
gally acquiring, say, her favorite indie 
band’s entire discography. The infor-
mational age is too far progressed 
for us to resist small endeavors like 

PostYourTest.com. There will always 
be spring-ups just like it, and since 
there is no way to entirely shut out the 
logical desire to peruse old examples 
in studying for new exams, it is in 
all of our best interests to accept this 
inevitability and work around it.

Though the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act of 1998 requires the 
removal of any material at the request 
of its author — much like television- 
or DVD-ripped videos on YouTube — 
any professor that uses these “rights” 
to his advantage is selfishly, fruitlessly 
and rather ignorantly beating back an 
era in which, for better or for worse, 
no one’s art is truly his own; by now, 
the hunger for information is too great 
and the network too strong. Instead 
of treading water in an idealistic pool 
of cronies, our professors’ efforts 
would be better applied to preparing 
more extensive and dynamic exams 
that change with each quarter (even, 
God forbid, reflect fluctuations a class 
could take in accordance with the 

The next president of the United States is going to have his work cut out for 
him. Either Sen. Barack Obama (D-
Ill.) or Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) 
stand to inherit two extremely 
unpopular wars in the Middle East, 
an impending recession with glob-
al repercussions, a failing public 
education system, a Social Security 
system in desperate need of a rapid 
and massive overhaul,  numer-
ous pressing health-care concerns 
and the need to repair our dam-
aged image throughout the world. 
All of these, plus the unforeseen 
issues that seemingly appear out of 
nowhere just when the president is 
getting into the swing of things, will 

make that $400,000 annual salary 
look rather paltry. However, at this 
point in the campaign season, all of 
these issues have become obsolete. 
It seems there is only one issue that 
both the candidates and the politi-
cal pundits wish to talk about. In 
fact, it isn’t an issue at all — it is 
just one man. His name is Joe the 
Plumber.

Joe the Plumber was originally 
thrust into the spotlight when he 
got a chance to voice concern over 
Obama’s tax policy during a cam-
paign stop in Toledo, Ohio. Joe said 
he fears that if Obama’s plans are 
implemented he will be unable to 
buy the plumbing business by which-
he is currently employed. McCain’s 
savvy political team picked up on 
this little video clip and attempt-
ed to use it against Obama in the 
final presidential debate, claiming 
that Joe would be unable to real-
ize the American dream unless the 
“Maverick” is elected. McCain’s 
original allusion to Joe opened a 
Pandora ’s box, with each candidate 
referring to this absurd scenario for 
the remainder of the debate, relat-
ing Joe’s plight to a variety of issues, 
including health care and Social 
Security. 

Of course, once the final presi-
dential debate was finished, a full-
fledged manhunt was on to track 
down Joe the Plumber. Every major 
television station sent a reporter 
and camera crew to Holland, Ohio, 
for the very first and, most likely, 
very last time. It’s not often some-
body like this comes along, and 
since reporters can’t interview the 
candidate’s tax policies personally, 
Joe was the next best thing. They 
camped out in front of his house 
day and night, holding vigil as if 
the pope had died and they were 
in Vatican City waiting to see the 
white smoke. If you didn’t know 
better, you could have easily got the 
impression that somehow Joe the 
Plumber was a man invested with 
powers from some sort of political 
deity — a man who understands the 
mindset of the average American 
so well that if the candidates could 
solve his problems, everything else 
would naturally sort itself out.

But who is the man who spawned

New Policy Helps Drop-aholics Put Down the ‘W’
By Deepak Seeni
Staff Writer

STUDENT LIFE — The beginning 
of every new academic quarter at 
UCSD often gives a revived sense of 
drive and ambition to students. But 
sometimes, when ambitions are set 
loose to run wild,  we find ourselves a 
little click-happy on WebReg, taking 
course loads so heavy that they are 
sure to be halved, or even quartered, 
in the coming weeks. Some take 
action early on; others, however, hold 
out until the very end, relying on the 
university’s “Withdrawal” policy to 
bail them out. 

While the Academic Senate 
Committee on Educational Policy’s 
recent adoption of a more stringent 
regulation regarding “W” marks on 
undergraduate transcripts is a step 
in the right direction, additional 
measures must be taken to com-
prehensively address excessive late 
withdrawals from enrolled classes. 
After over a year of deliberation, the 
committee has created an amend-
ment to the university’s enrollment 
and withdrawal policy that restricts 
students from receiving a “W” in a 
certain class more than once, aim-
ing to not only encourage students 
to think twice about their class load 

at the beginning of each quarter, 
but also free up waitlists from 

students who repeatedly 
enroll in a specific 

class but drop 
at the last 

minute 

and receive a “W” grade.  
However, while this modifica-

tion to university enrollment and 
drop policy is a step in the right 
direction, addressing some of the 
problems pertaining to student 
withdrawals from classes, it is cer-
tainly not a final solution. While the 
policy does free up student waitlists, 
it does not facilitate key interaction 
between students and professors 
that can be crucial in preventing 
excessive course withdrawals in the 
future. 

A drop policy similar to that 
of UC Berkeley’s, which requires 
students to fill out a petition and 
receive approval from the course 
professor, would not only force stu-
dents to think twice about their 
motivations for both adding and 
withdrawing from a course, but also 
enable professors to deny requests 
to students who have repeatedly 
enrolled and dropped their classes. 

The present enrollment and 
drop system available online via 

Tritonlink may be convenient, 
but the inclusion of pro-

fessor approval in the 

withdrawal process would serve as 
a strong deterrent to excessive drop-
ping and improve the quality of 
undergraduate education through 
some good old-fashioned face time.

Each quarter, undergraduate 
courses that place an emphasis on 
student participation, interaction 
and discussion suffer from uncom-
mitted enrollees who repeatedly bite 
off more than they can chew by 
overloading on classes and dropping 
at crunch-time without any serious 
consequence.

Not only does this practice 
deprive students who would have 
completed the course a seat in the 
lecture hall, but also interferes 
with the educational experience of 
those already enrolled, as discus-
sion groups become smaller and 
lab partners disappear during ninth 
week.

Thus, it becomes imperative that 
any additional changes to the uni-
versity’s add and drop policies must 
force students to further evaluate 
their course loads at the beginning 
of each quarter and through their 
academic careers. It would be in 

our own best interest — and the 
interests of our peers and profes-
sors — to realize that a commit-
ment made to any course is not all 
the invisible, light-hearted matter it 
seems to be on TritonLink, and that 
any course addition or withdrawal 
is a serious decision that shouldn’t 
be left to a whim. 

If college is to be an experi-
ence that serves to better prepare 
us for the working world, tightened 
withdrawal restrictions are a much-
needed wake-up call. Not only do 
such regulatory policies serve to 
purify the classroom experience, 
but they also provide us with a new, 
more realistic sense of responsibil-
ity, pushing us to grasp the serious-
ness of our academic commitments 
and the consequences that will 
result if such policies are broken. 
In the professional world, much like 
the academic one, biting of more 
than we can chew can have negative 
repercussions that affect everyone 
involved.

Gilchrist Made False 
Claims, Encouraged Hate 

Dear Editor, 
I would like to clarify why on Oct. 

16, many of us protested Jim Gilchrist’s 
presence on campus. 

Most readers would agree that uni-
versities are not soapboxes for people 
to freely express their unsubstantiated 
opinions. The university is a forum for 
those seeking to grow our collective 
knowledge constructively. Gilchrist is 
not that type of speaker. He willfully 
distorts the facts about immigration. 
In a recent article, he blames undocu-
mented immigrants for a host of social 
ills. He said they increase crime includ-
ing violent offenses. He holds them 
responsible for our current economic 
instability and budget crisis. He even 
accuses them of bringing leprosy. In 
the section of the article where he lays 
out these accusations, Gilchrist pro-
vides only one footnote as a reference: 
a Los Angeles Times article which he 
claims states how L.A. has the lowest 
literacy rate of any city in the country. 
Not once does the article mention 
illiteracy. It’s about two-year schools 
charging higher fees (Gilchrist conve-
niently left out the part of the title that 
states this). 

Most of Gilchrist’s claims are 
unfounded. Experts consistently point 
out that immigration (including the 

undocumented kind) has an overall 
positive effect on the U.S. economy. 
Immigrants pay the same real-estate 
taxes and the same sales and other con-
sumption taxes that other Americans 
pay. There is no basis for the leprosy 
claim. Also, the notion that undocu-
mented immigrants are more prone to 
commit crimes does not square with 
government data. 

The facts say that overall, undocu-
mented immigrants make this country 
a better place. That is why immigrants’ 
rights advocates seek to give these peo-
ple legal status. The majority of them 
are productive, law-abiding citizens 
(except for their undocumented status, 
which is a misdemeanor offense. So is 
jaywalking). We owe it to them. 

The other reason why we opposed 
Gilchrist’s presence on campus is 
because we consider his speech to be 
hateful and potentially harmful to the 
millions of Latinos who live in this 
country. The lies he spreads are like 
yelling fire in a crowded theater. In 
2007, Gilchrist told a crowd of 400 
people that “it’s OK to say ‘rapist,’ ‘rob-
ber’ and ‘murder’ when referring to 
‘illegal aliens’.” This is exactly the sort 
of mental picture of immigrants that 
leads some to commit shameful and 
sometimes fatal acts of violence against 
them. It is no coincidence that since 
the Minutemen — and other similar 
nativist groups — began their cru-
sade in recent years, there has been a 

dramatic increase in anti-Latino hate 
crimes.  

We tried to prevent our respected 
institution from validating Gilchrist as 
a legitimate commentator on immigra-
tion issues and amplifying his message 
of hate. I regret that in the end, UCSD 
and the Osher Institute fell into his trap. 
The next time he speaks at a forum, he 
will likely qualify his deceitful rhetoric 
by saying that he was once invited to 
lecture at UCSD as a “distinguished 
lecturer.” Shame on this university for 
allowing him to do so.

Ethnic studies Ph.D. candidate                                      

 For A.S. Activities or Not, 
There Have Been Fee Hikes    
Dear Editor,

There hasn’t been a fee referen-
dum since 1985? Seriously, what are 
you guys smoking? Your editorial 
said that the proposed activity fee ref-
erendum would be the first one put 
before the student body “since the 
council’s inception in 1985.” That’s a 
load of bull.  Allow me to school you 
on UCSD history:

2001: A.S./Price Center $70 
“Campus Life” fee referendum; 2002: 
Athletics hikes your fees by $26.50; 
2002: Eleanor Roosevelt hikes fees 
by $5; 2002: $39 Price Center fee 
hike; 2003: A.S. $6.75 fee referen-

dum; 2002-03: John Muir, Revelle, 
Thurgood Marshall, Sixth Colleges 
hike fees; 2004: Earl Warren College 
hikes fees by $4; 2006: Athletics hikes 
your fees by $75; 2007: A.S. hikes 
fees by $7 (from $21 to $28); 2008: 
Warren hikes fees by $3.

And those are just the ones I 
found in five minutes of Googling 
the Guardian archives. Every eight 
months, more people try to get you 
students to raise your fees to fund 
their idiot projects. This referendum 
isn’t a novel idea, and it’s certainly not 
the first time it has happened since 
1985.  The A.S. Council last hiked its 
activity fee from $21 to $28 in 2007.
Your short memories are a disservice 
to your readership.

somewhat of a purifier to the system,

MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 7

over at the dining commons, the 
Grove needs to do one thing and do 
it right. There are countless other 
coffee/salad/sandwich/bagel carts 
on campus selling the exact same 
snacks, only cheaper and with better 
service. Thomas’ tenure has illus-
trated that throwing more money at 
a problem won’t fix it. If the Grove 
wants to stay competitive Lakhani 
and Thomas need to get their acts 
together and use some common 
sense: don’t spend money week after 
week on a huge inventory of fast-
expiring salads that repeatedly go 
unpurchased, cut down your sum-
mer hours to save money when stu-
dents aren’t on campus and put some 
effort into customer service. The 
Grove of UCSD Past’s one weak sell-
ing point was its back-to-basics, cof-

fee-beneath-the-trees vibe. Thomas 
was quick to destroy that, in failing 
to retain old passionate staffers, who 
brought business to the cafe through 
a genuine enthusiasm and the kind 
of word of mouth you can’t pay 
for. And the careless council sat by 
and let it happen. Now students are 
stuck footing a bill four times larger 
than it needed to be, for a cafe now 
infinitely less popular. 

The purpose of an A.S. enter-
prise is to bring the council a source 
of funding, while simultaneously 
training undergrad employees and 
providing the student body with 
a useful service. That’s how stu-
dent government enterprises work 
at our northern sisters UCLA and 
UC Berkeley. While it’s a simple 
concept, it’s one our own A.S. coun-
cilmembers can’t seem it wrap their 

heads around. Imagine an efficient 
A.S. Council. One that actually gen-
erated its own funding, governed 
thoughtfully, functioned proactively 
and didn’t depend on students as a 
constant bailout for its own lack of 
incompetence. 

It’s doubtful the Grove can ever 
recover from the debt Thomas dug 
it into last year. It’s certain the enter-
prise cannot recover from a debt 
two times its size. There were a 
hundred failures that led the Grove 
to the point we find it today, but 
now is the time for councilmembers 
to stop postponing action in hopes 
that someone else will deal with the 
problem tomorrow. We can’t wait 
another year.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

the encompassing moniker Joe the 
Plumber, really? Joe Wurzelbacher 
is, indeed, a plumber. He no doubt 
is an expert at sporting the heralded 
“plumber’s crack.” And if you have 
seen him interviewed you know that 
he talks with a firmness of opinion 
that everyone in the Buckeye State 
would be proud of. Joe is a plumber 
who has worked so hard he now 
stands to purchase a plumbing com-
pany of his own. A purchase that 
would almost certainly push him 
over the $250,000 annual income 
level and would place him in the top 
tax bracket — a level that Obama 
does plan to raise taxes on. But, 
perhaps those sterling Midwestern 
credentials are not what make the 
issue of Joe the Plumber so impor-
tant. What is important is how the 
candidates want you to see Joe the 
Plumber — not as a man, but as 
America itself.

The power of the individual is 
one of the most exalted ideals in the 
United States. The American dream 
is ingrained in the moral fabric 
of every citizen from a young age 
— every person can be successful 
as long as they work hard and pay 
their taxes. The United States gov-
ernment is simply entrusted with 
the responsibility of making this 
happen and protecting us when we 
do realize that dream. That’s why, 
despite the comical media circus 
surrounding the entire situation, 
the idea of Joe the Plumber has 
resonated so powerfully across the 
country, with less than two weeks 
left until Election Day. Joe the 
Plumber, just a hardworking bald 
man trying to raise his kids and buy 
a plumbing company.

But how similar is Joe the 
Plumber to the average American, 
anyway? A man who is worried 
about paying his taxes because he 
will likely earn more than $250,000 
next year? I don’t profess to be an 
economic expert, but considering 
the likely cost of living in Holland, 
Ohio, I would think that $250,000 
is more than enough to keep a roof 
over anybody’s head. Joe is such an 
economic and political expert that 
he has the balls to refer to Obama’s 
plan to redistribute wealth as social-
ism. I truly hope such a high level of 
understanding is not representative 
of the average American.

It’s true the next president will 
have to focus on protecting the 
American middle class, because 
that is where a large majority of 
Americans find themselves today. 
But focusing on one man, no matter 
how amusing he is, is not the way to 
solve the problems the United States 
now faces. What Joe the Plumber 
thinks or says will not have any 
bearing on the current economic 
crisis or help us responsibly end 
the wars we are fighting abroad. Joe 
may be a hardworking American, 
and that is to be respected, but this 
relentless attention given to him by 
the candidates and the media has 
done little to teach voters about the 
issues they will be forced to grapple 
with come Nov. 4. The fact that the 
Katie Courics of the world have 
even given him the time of day is 
rather alarming, considering there 
are so many important problems 
left to discuss. So please, just let 
Joe the Plumber plumb. Because 
no matter who wins, I’m sure he 
has plenty of work to do if he really 
does want to buy that business.

T rekking to class late on a Friday afternoon can be disheartening in and of itself, but for students simultaneously missing out on a 
religious holiday inherent to their cultural iden-
tity, the path can be even more problematic. 

Professor Rick Ord, computer-science lec-
turer for seven years — as well as the director 
of the computing facility in the department of 
computer science and engineering from 1988 
to 2001 — has witnessed many of his students’ 
moral conflicts in choosing between class and 
religious celebration.

“More and more students, be they Jewish, 
Muslim, et cetera, have been asking to take 
quizzes early or do labs on a different day 
because of Islamic and Jewish holidays that fell 
on days in early October,” Ord said. 

UCSD does have a contingency policy for 
students requesting alternate test and assign-
ment dates. On the Academic Senate Web site, 
the Committee on Educational Policy stipulates 
that students who anticipate conflicts with final 
exams must submit a written statement no 

later than two weeks into the quarter; for other 
routine testing dates, students must submit a 
letter to the professor as soon as they discover 
the conflict, at which point the professor is 
required to provide an alternative testing option 
if possible.

“All of our instructors make all reasonable 
efforts to accommodate scheduling conflicts 
with any student’s religious schedule,” univer-
sity spokesman Rex Graham said in an e-mail. 
“It is the policy of the university to make rea-
sonable efforts to accommodate students hav-
ing bona fide religious conflicts with scheduled 
examinations by providing a lternative times or 
methods to take such examinations.”

Some students feel the university could be 
more sensitive to lesser-celebrated religious 
holidays.

“I know a lot of people who can’t make it 
to events because they had class or midterms 
that they just couldn’t get out of,” said Revelle 
College sophomore Sukhreet Ghuman, head of 
social events for the Sikh Student Association. “I 
feel like every religious community would want 
the same equitable treatment in terms of profes-
sors observing various religious holidays.”

Accommodating students with legitimate 
reasons to be absent from class is not the only 
issue over which Ord is concerned. After con-
sidering more seriously the widely differing 
backgrounds at UCSD, Ord feels a more com-
plete awareness of these religions and holidays 
is called for. 

While researching the topic online, Ord 
stumbled upon the official religious calendar 
of the University of Indiana, Bloomington. He 
considered a similar option at UCSD.

Ord said he’s not asking that an official 
religious calendar be incorporated into UCSD’s 
existing campus calendar — just that there 
should be some sort of calendar identifying 
the major religious holidays of the world on 
UCSD’s Web site. 

“It would be extremely difficult to get a uni-
versitywide religious calendar supported by all 
departments,” Ord said. “But one for the public, 
students, faculty and administrators just needs 
to be more available.” 

According to the Center for Student 
Involvement, there are 41 registered religious 

New Love for the Old Stuff: A Lesson in National Monuments
W ith the general election loom-ing closer and closer every day, television and newspapers bom-
bard the political circuit with candi-
dates’ opposing principles and policies, 
which all claim one thing: the right 
course. Whether it 
be in the form of 
extensive change 
promised by Sen. 
Barack Obama (D-
Ill.) or the central 
reform touted by 
Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), politi-
cians on the Hill have been asserting 
their capacity to put America back on 
track. But most students of political 
history will tell you that the country is 
always on the wrong path come elec-
tion season, and politicians often forget 
their promises to the American people 
once votes are cast. It’s a never-ending 
cycle of change and turnaround that 
brings petty politics and hollow prom-

ises to every level of government. 
If politicians were smart, they’d 

stop focusing solely on the future and 
pay a bit more attention to the past. 
As McCain would say, “My friends, 
you must look at the records.” In this 

case, the records are 
American history 
101. 

Besides being the 
political center of the 
nation, Washington, 
D.C. boasts an enor-
mous amount of his-
tory that beckons to 

millions of tourists from around the 
globe who want to see how one simple 
act of treason more than 200 years ago 
became the model for the free world. 

As a history enthusiast — one 
who can recite the preamble to the 
Constitution by memory and who 
watched an entire John Adams mini-
series with unusual zeal — I’ve been 
enjoying my opportunity to visit 

Washington, D.C.’s historical sites. I’ve 
been to the National Mall twice, and 
every Tuesday, if I don’t have class 
or work, I wander the Smithsonian 
museums, which are finally free of the 
weekend’s bussed-in tourists. 

While I enjoy touring our colo-
nial history, I try to avoid sites filled 
with fanny-packed tourists, staggering 
through an unfamiliar setting with no 
idea where they’re going, staring at the 
past through a camera lens and clicking 
away in whatever direction their tour 
guide points.  

Even representatives, who rub the 
toe of George Washington’s statue on 
their way into the House chambers 
for luck, can forget the ideologies that 
Americans have trusted them to pro-
tect. Luckily, the words of wisdom and 
warning from the Founding Fathers 
are everywhere: carved into the stone

Imagine a place where you 
could score prizes for sharing old 
finals and midterms — where by 
simply providing your professor’s 
name and the title of your course, 
you could gain access to last 
year’s chemistry or physics final, 
for free. Good news — St. Louis 
University graduate Demir Oral 
has created a Web site that fulfills 
your every finals-week fantasy.

PostYourTest.com, sponsored 
entirely by ads to avoid usage 
fees, brings in over 1,000 reg-
istered users and approximately 
50,000 visitors a month. There are 
over 500 posted tests: some from 
Harvard, Notre Dame and St. 
Louis University, but the majority 
of which come from our very own 
campus. 

As UCSD contributes approxi-
mately 90 percent of this site’s 
posted tests, concern has arisen 
among faculty regarding issues 
such as academic integrity and 
copyright violations. 

Students and professors post 
old exams online in exchange for 
coffee cards, gas cards and elec-
tronics. The site follows a points-
per-post system in which users 
earn two points per test posted, 
which can then be exchanged for 
rewards. Exams can be posted 
anonymously, and individuals do 
not have to be registered users 
in order to view them. However, 
only registered users are able to 
participate in the reward system.

Nearly a year after 
PostYourTest.com’s 
conception, students 
and faculty continue 
to debate issues of 
copyright violation and 
academic morality.

U pon first glance, an unwitting passerby might mistake the dark shapes cutting through the waters of La Jolla Shores 
for lumps of seaweed, but after wading a 
few yards into the chilly ocean, even the 
legally blind quickly come to realize why 
the area has been dubbed Shark City. 

Every year, hundreds of leopard sharks 
make their way down the West Coast in 
search of a warmer climate and breeding 
grounds. Their numbers are the greatest 
in August when the average water tem-
perature reaches its annual high, 68 degrees 
Fahrenheit, making it the peak month for 
sightings.  

Shark City is located at the southernmost 
end of La Jolla Shores. It is by no means a 
secret; masses of kayakers and snorkelers 

congregate in the area, serving 
as a blatant marker to the location of these 
glorified fish. The best launching spots 
for paddled and finned marine enthusiasts 
alike are directly in front of the La Jolla 
Beach and Tennis Club and especially in 
front of the Marine Room Restaurant. 

The sandy flats are more popular with 
the leopard sharks than the nearby caves 
because they prefer to scavenge the shal-
low sea bottom for mollusks, crabs, worms, 
shrimp and fish. With mouths about the 
size of a quarter, the sharks pose no threat 
to humans and actually prefer to swallow 
their small foodstuffs whole. 

While beachgoers need not subscribe 
to Steven Spielberg-induced Hollywood 
exaggerations and gore, it’s not to say that 
swimming with these animals is without 
suspense. One second you’re watching the 
reflection of the sun dance on the sand, and 

the next you’re caught com-
pletely off guard as a four-

foot shark slithers right 
under you. Given that 

the sharks travel in 
loose schools, it’s 

common to see 
upward of a 

dozen com-
ing and 

g o i n g 
in all 

directions, many in less than an arm’s reach. 
Depending on age, they range in size from 
three to seven feet, and their elaborate pat-
terns vary between shades of light brown 
and black. 

There are numerous ways to view 
the sharks. Snorkeling is probably 
the best, though just standing in the 
shallows as they wind around your 
legs offers a rival perspective; wad-
ers beware that sting rays are also 
drawn the warm water, so shuffle-
walking is a must. Kayaks allow 
onlookers to cover more area 
and thus appreciate the num-
ber of sharks from a slight-
ly removed position. Some 
people even scope the scene 
from stand-up paddleboards. 
The best sighting conditions 
from any angle are low tide, 
low surf, bright overhead 
sun, no wind and warm 
water. 

Many shops along 
Avenida de la Playa offer 
equipment rentals and 
guided tours. La Jolla 
Kayak supplies wetsuits, 
masks and fins for $24 per 
day, and kayaks (which the 
company brings to and from the 
beach) for $28 every two hours. They also 
offer combo tours of the caves and Shark 
City that involve equal parts kayaking and 
snorkeling, which run $65 for all the gear, 
a knowledgeable guide and two hours of 
exploring — though guided snorkel tours of 
Shark City are completely unnecessary. 

Students looking for an up-close and 
personal marine experience should defi-
nitely check out this nearby attraction.

12 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2008

Oral, who took a summer phys-
ics course at UCSD, was inspired 
to create the site after taking a 
test his junior year at St. Louis 
University. On his way out, he over-
heard two students discussing an 
old exam they had studied from. 
Oral thought it was unfair that 
only select students were able to 
gain access to these resources, and 
wished the valuable study mate-
rial could have been available to 
everyone. 

“I had to always study hard, and 
I would have appreciated profes-
sors’ previous tests to reference so 
that I could not only get a feel for 
how a professor tests, but also for 
how difficult this class is going to 
be,” Oral wrote on the Web site. 

PostYourTest.com was launched 
in November 2007, but only gained 
its current popularity after a series 
of news reports in June 2008. 

Former UCSD Academic Senate 
chairman and biology professor Jim 
Posakony said he is uneasy about 
students using the site.

“I react [unkindly] to someone 
acquiring a document from other 
than the copyright owner and mak-
ing it public,” Posakony said. “The 
instructors may have no intention 
of making their exams available to 
the public.” 

Amid growing controversy, a 
“banned list” was created on the 
site in which professors could make 
sure their material wasn’t posted. 
Oral said that 20 to 30 percent 
of the request forms for the opt-
out list were submitted incorrectly, 
such as failing to indicate the iden-
tity of the professor. As a result, the 
site is no longer adding instructors’ 
names to the list; however, the site 
continues to honor all previously 
made requests. 

In June, the UCSD Academic 
Senate decided to take a differ-
ent approach. Associate Campus

strung along the walls and corridors 
of the Capitol, the White House, the 
Supreme Court and the Library of 
Congress. Elected officials and see-
all-the-sites-in-a-day vacationers 
would do well to take a tour from 
a capable guide, one who dispels 
the stereotype of tedium and really 
brings the past alive. Mary, the tour 
guide from Philadelphia, can do 
just that. 

When she arrived for our sched-
uled tour in colonial attire, com-
plete with a white lacy bonnet, I 
inwardly groaned. However, she led 
us around the landmarks of the 
old city with ease, pointing out the 
various points of interest with a 
matter-of-fact attitude that made 
me wonder whether she’d been alive 
during the time period she’d just 
discussed. 

“You know, Benjamin Franklin 
was appointed as an ambassa-
dor to France in 1776, where he 
developed a fetish for French 
women,” she said. “But he liked 
the French and eventually reworked 
his approach to European diplo-
matic relations, which later helped 
secure the Treaty of Paris in 1783. 
He showed that it pays to have for-
eign friends.” 

In one go, she told me more 
about a Founding Father’s life, both 
political and marital, than I’d ever 
read about in a history textbook — 
and I retained it. Mary kept history 
fresh, entertaining and relevant. 

In the same way, because our 
country is so young, our history 
is well preserved. There are pre-
served copies of the Declaration 
of Independence, the Bill of Rights 
and our Constitution, the last of 
which looks as though it was signed 
yesterday. That kind of history is 
tangible enough to generate pride 
even from us, the 11th generation 

of Americans since the founding 
of the United States. The time cap-
sule-like preservation makes monu-
ments and documents more than 
just history and grounds them in 
modernity, for better or worse.  

Abraham Lincoln, sitting high 
in his marble chair, may inspire awe 
or a camera-happy reaction, but the 
words carved into the sides of his 
memorial are true to the time and 
lessons of history — a characteristic 
similar to many of our monuments 
and much of our national history 
— that sometimes go unheeded. 

George Washington’s warning 
against unwarranted involvement 
in foreign nations’ affairs in his 
farewell message must have been 
overlooked by President George W. 
Bush when he entered Iraq. James 

Madison wrote about the evils of 
political factions and partisanship 
in dividing the nation to the point 
of inefficacy in legislation, a les-
son that would have been help-
ful to those who failed to foresee 
and properly address the financial 
market crisis until now. The list of 
politicians who should have heeded 
history only grows by the day: Ted 
Stevens should have known about 
the consequences of corruption 
from Thomas Jefferson; Michelle 
Bachman might have learned some-
thing about Americanism from 
John Adams; and as Mary the tour 
guide pointed out, there is some-
thing to be said about sexual discre-
tion, a lesson Tim Mahoney learned 
too late. 

America is a country divided by 

religious, racial, social and economic 
disparities as well as regional bound-
aries. There is one thing that tethers 
us to each other and to this land: the 
preservation of the principles upon 
which our nation was founded. And 
the easiest way to remember this tie 
is to study a little American history, 
to see the monuments, museums 
and memorials and to appreciate 
this country for what it has been and 
what it can become. 

With any luck, the first act of the 
new president-elect on Nov. 5 will 
be to take a tour of the Washington 
they live and work in, carefully tak-
ing note of history to learn a thing 
or two about the right course for 
America. Hopefully, they’ll bring 
more than a fanny-pack and a cam-
era.

groups on campus, in addition to a 
hefty handful of unofficial ones. 

SSA, as one of UCSD’s official 
religious groups, facilitates student 
celebratation of the 300-year-old Sikh 
tradition.

“Any kind of calendar would help 
religious organizations throughout 
UCSD spread the word of their holi-
days and events, as we lack diversity,”  
Thurgood Marshall College senior and 
SSA Director of Events Ruby Bhangoo 
said. “This will allow those who are 
passionate and want to celebrate their 
holidays an opportunity to celebrate 
them and perhaps even put on an 
event on campus.” 

Even many nonreligious students 
agree that the simple act of formally 
recognizing varying religious groups 
will help the campus.

“I consider myself staunchly 
nonreligious,” John Muir College 
junior Michelle Louden said. “[But] 
I think such a calendar would be 
a positive change because Christians 
aren’t the only religious group here 
in the U.S. and within UCSD. We are 
a very diverse group of people and 
Christianity shouldn’t be the only reli-
gion to have its holidays respected.”

The University of Southern 
California’s Web site has a religious 
calendar, as does UCLA’s. The ques-
tion professors like Ord and religious 
minorities are asking is: Why not 
UCSD? 

“The world is changing,” Ord said. 
“I grew up in the Midwest, where every-
one had names like Bob, Tim, Jane and 
Mary. People just need to be a little bit 
more aware of other students’ religious 
practices these days. It will make us a 
more united group of people.”

Louden said she wouldn’t feel left 
out if accommodations were made 
for other students of various belief 
systems. 

“Religion isn’t something we can 
really argue with,” Louden said. “It’s very 
personal. If religious students feel they 
need to have time off to observe holi-
days while I’m in class, they’re just going 
to have to work harder to keep up.”

Ghuman said she hopes her pro-

fessors will consider making an excep-
tion for events like Diwali, the Festival 
of Lights — celebrated by Hindus, 
Sikhs and Jains — which falls on Nov. 
3. During the festival, SSA will light 
up Library Walk with candles starting 
at 6 p.m.

While Ord sympathizes with stu-
dents who want a religious calendar and 
policies respecting religious respites, he 
adds that it’s even more important from 
a faculty perspective. 

“Some type of available calendar 
could make it so teachers are aware 
of ongoing religious events and don’t 
have to rearrange their schedules when 
it hits at the last minute,” he said. 

According to Graham, the six-
college system — while a continual 
strength of UCSD — also contributes 
to the difficulty of keeping students 
centralized and up to date on events. 
He said another problem with form-
ing such a calendar, even just online, 
would be the risk of leaving out reli-
gious groups who may not be repre-
sented substantially at UCSD but still 
want recognition. 

Some have concerns about poten-
tial abuse of an updated calender.

“You’re always going to have those 
people who try to take advantage of 
the system and don’t act with integrity 
on things like this,” said Earl Warren 
College freshman Alexa-Rae Navarro. 
“Generally, when I look at the UCSD 
population, I get the vibe of people 
who really want to be here and are 
focused on their studies. Even if the 
option was given to miss class or a test, 
I feel the majority would completely 
disregard it. I know I wouldn’t want 
to give up an important day of class 
because I know could be getting that 
much farther ahead.” 

Calendar or no calendar, respect-
ing others in a rapidly expanding, 
diverse society seems to lie at the heart 
of the issue.

As Ord put it: “If you have the 
opportunity to make allowances for 
a student with a legitimate religious 
excuse, why not?”

On Sunday, Oct. 26, the UCSD Medical Lawn became the stage for a fund-raising walk on campus. In an effort 
to raise donations for the Juvenile Diabetes 
Research Foundation, one of  the leading 
advocates of  type-1 diabetes research 
worldwide, thousands gathered to stroll through 
campus after raising sponsorship donations. 
While charity walks have recently grown in 
popularity, they have taken place for decades. 
The annual AIDS Walk San Diego celebrated its

MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  15

Counsel Daniel Park contacted 
Oral asking if the university could 
submit a blanket opt-out list in 
which professors wishing to ban 
their tests from the site could fill 
out customized forms, collectively 
gathered and sent to PostYourTest.
com. Oral consented, and approxi-
mately 170 UCSD professors added 
their names to the banned list. 

Despite questions of academic 
morality, Oral defends the use of 
old tests as a valuable study guide 
and resource for students.

“Sharing old exams is a study 
method, not cheating,” Oral said. 
“It gives an outline of what profes-
sors can ask. Professors can also 
use this site to improve their old 
curriculum in such a way that stu-
dents can have an understanding 
of how that professor is going to 
administer the exam, as well as set 
up a better exam.”

Student opinion of the contro-
versy surrounding the site gener-
ally falls on Oral’s side.

“It’s not considered cheating 
because the tests that you’re look-
ing at are not the same ones you’re 
going to be receiving,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore 
Nathalia Torres said. “It serves as a 
good study guide because it gives a 
good outlook on what the professor 
expects you to know.” 

Posakony, who was involved 
in the UCSD Academic Senate’s 
response to the Web site, said it was 
important for the senate not to take 
sides, but to instead respond to the 
site in a neutral manner by inform-
ing the faculty of the situation and 
their options.

“Senate was in a position that 
was careful — we didn’t want to 
presume that all faculty would be 
opposed,” Posakony said. “We felt 
like whatever we did it couldn’t be 
something that shut down the Web 
site; it had to be up to the professor. 
Some faculty felt it was almost their 
duty to give students access to tests 
and answer keys, while others were 
appalled.”

The senate’s opt-out list is no 
longer an option. Instead, if a pro-
fessor wants their material taken 
off the site, they must wait until 
one of their exams is posted and 
then request that the content is 
removed. This request must follow 
the guidelines for completing  the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
takedown request, posted on the 
Web site to alleviate concerns of 
copyright violation.

All professors in the UC sys-
tem legally own the copyright to 
their exams, so Oral faces the pos-
sible accusation that posting this 
material without the consent of the 
copyright owner is, in fact, illegal. 

Oral argued that the site does 
not infringe on copyright laws, 
asserting that all copyrighted mate-
rial is removed when requested, 
in accordance with the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. 
Other Web sites such as YouTube 
also use this act in their regulated 
removal of copyrighted material.

“We do and will honor all prop-
erly submitted opt-out requests,” 
Oral said in an e-mail.

However, whether or not the 
copying and distribution of these 
online exams abide by “fair use” — 
the manner by which copyrighted 
material is allowed to be used with-
out the permission of the owner 

— is still up for debate. 
Posakony said that posting these 

exams does not constitute fair use, 
as it grants access and distribution 
to a larger group of people than was 
intended originally.

“When you post an exam on a 
Web site with free access, then in 
principle, millions of people could 
copy, print and further distribute 
it,” Posakony said. “It is still an 
undecided question as to whether 
or not this particular use of exams 
constitutes fair use or not.”

Posakony added that the debate 
over whether the site violates 
copyright laws could possibly be 
grounds for a future legal suit. 

“If [the Web site] brings a 
ground flow of anger from all the 
UCs, I could imagine legal action 
being taken,” Posakony said. 

However, as of now, UCSD is 
the only UC campus that is signifi-
cantly influenced by the site, and 
reactions vary among faculty and 
students.

“I think there are good things 
about PostYourTest.com,” econom-
ics professor Kate Antonovics said 
in an e-mail. “For years, fraterni-
ties and the like have kept copies 
of old exams from various classes. 
PostYourTest.com just levels the 
playing field; now any student can 
gain access to old exams. What’s 
more, it drives home to instruc-
tors the importance of writing new 
questions each year.”

John Muir College freshman 
Elena Coupal is also on Oral’s side. 

“Obviously they’re not going to 
use the same midterm every time,” 
she said. “I don’t understand what 
the problem is because it would be 
good practice for the students.”

Meanwhile, Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Raymond Robles 
sympathizes with professors that 
are frustrated by the site. 

“I support free exchange of 
information, but I understand how 
this could be really irritating and 
counterproductive for faculty,” 
Robles said. “If they want to cut 
down on academic dishonesty, they 
should change tests.”

Oral plans to make his Web site 
as global as possible. He added 
that an individual from the Arab 
country Oman recently posted an 
exam on the site. Oral also plans to 
expand PostYourTest.com by mak-
ing standardized tests such as the 
MCATs and LSATs accessible for 
free.

“I feel that PostYourTest.com 
will have a large impact on the 
improvement and evolution of 
higher education for both students 
and professors across the world,” 
Oral said in an e-mail. 

Whether it results in students 
gaining access to better study 
guides, professors changing their 
exams on a regular basis or action 
taking place in the courtroom, the 
Web site has undoubtedly made an 
impact.

“We as professors have entered 
a new era in which information 
and documents are so much more 
distributable and accessible than 
they ever were, and we have to take 
this into account,” Posakony said. 
“We have to respond to this one 
way or another, either by adjusting 
practices accordingly or through 
legal action.”

ist Janessa Werhane served up two 
aces to give UCSD a 12-5 advantage 
early in the game, with senior outside 
hitter Kimberly Carpenter blasting 
consecutive kills to extend the lead 
to 10 points at 21-11. UCSD took the 
second set on an Otter ball-handling 
error. 

The final game was the closest 
of the night as the Tritons couldn’t 
establish a rhythm. The set featured 
four lead changes and 13 ties before 
Condon put the game away with a 
solo block and the final kill. 

Bailey, who finished the night with 
14 kills on .387 hitting, said she felt 
the team worked as a cohesive unit 
during the victory. 

“The win was great because we 
really played together,” Bailey said. 
“We made it a goal tonight to play all 
out. I think we did that and put it all 
out on the court.”

On Friday night, San Francisco 
State (11-12, 4-10 CCAA) jumped on 
the Tritons early. UCSD got off to a 
slow start in the first set and failed to 
put an offense together. The Tritons 
caught up at 21-20 and almost tied the 
score, but immediately gave up three 
straight points and lost the set. 

“It felt like six individuals,” junior 
setter Elaine Chen said. “We weren’t 
playing as a team and as a result we 
weren’t playing at a high intensity 
like we normally do — we just felt 
really flat.”

UCSD finally looked to be on a 
roll after taking a 15-10 lead in the 
second game, but struggled to put 
the set away as San Francisco State 
caught up to within a point at 22-21. 
Following a timeout, the Tritons ral-
lied to take the set but couldn’t main-

tain the momentum. Tying the score 
15 times, the Gators finally capitalized 
on several Triton miscues and took a 
2-1 lead in the third match. 

The final sets for the Tritons 
revealed the squad’s true character. 
Coming together after being down 
13-8 and 8-3 respectively in the fourth 
and fifth sets, the Tritons relied on 
the upperclassmen to lead the way. 
Bailey sent down a kill to cement a 
lead and Chen followed with a solo 
block to finish the fourth set in which 
UCSD rallied to finish the game on a 
17-10 run. 

Behind in the final game, 
Carpenter served up a scoring run 
that orchestrated the final comeback 
for the Tritons. With the score tied on 
four consecutive points, the Tritons 
recovered to take the win on a block 
by sophomore outsider hitter Lauren 
Bradley and junior outside hitter 
Sylvia Schmidt. 

Bailey finished the night with a 
season-high 28 kills while Chen had 
57 assists, six digs, two blocks and five 
aces. Netting the wins were important 
for the Tritons, but come Monday the 
team will be focused on the games 
ahead.

“We are going to get back in prac-
tice and train like we normally do,” 
Chen said. “We need to keep the same 
level of intensity during practice like 
it was during the CSUMB game and 
keep doing what we’ve been doing.”

UCSD faces tough competition in 
its Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 contests, taking

ing the Wildcats again. 

Inouye also expressed confi-
dence in UCSD’s ability to earn a 
trip back to the NCAA National 
Championships. 

“I’m really excited for regionals, 
because it’s our home course and

know our team is going to do some 
damage out there.”

goal lead. Unfortunately for UCSD, 
a controversial call gave the Gauchos 
a chance for a game-tying goal with 
under five seconds left in regulation.

“We had the game won in regula-
tion,” Harper said. “The referee pur-
posely gave Santa Barbara a chance at 
the end of the game when the game 
should have been over. The time should 
have expired, but the people at the desk 
were being really careful in giving [the 
Gauchos] extra time.”

UCSB did not waste the chance, 
tying the game with a goal at the end 
of regulation.

The Triton offense came out strong 
in the first overtime period, scoring 
twice and putting the Gauchos in a 
hole. UCSB quieted the Tritons in the 
second period by scoring a couple 
goals of its own to tie the game and 
send it into sudden death. After the 
first two sudden-death periods went 
by scoreless, UCSB netted the winning 
goal to top the Tritons for the first time 
this season.

Even though the Tritons were able 
to score twice in overtime, they had 
more offensive chances that they were 
unable to capitalize on. UCSD went 
0-3 on six-on-five chances in the five 
extra periods, allowing the Gauchos 
a chance to take the game. Still, the 
shaky officiating was an issue that, 
according to Harper, went beyond 
minor disagreements.

“This referee is kind of known as 
the ‘Santa Barbara Referee,’” he said. 
“He did everything he possibly could 
to help UCSB, and I don’t say that too 
often.”

The Tritons will have a chance to 
bounce back from the tough weekend 
as they come back home for a double-
header against UC Santa Cruz and 
Pomona-Pitzer University on Nov. 2.

earlier in the season, came out strong 
against the Lions in the first half even 
after suffering the five-overtime loss to 
UCSB. After taking a 3-1 lead at the 
start of the contest, the Tritons held on 
to a slim lead at halftime, on top 5-4.

Senior utility A.J. Kotanjian scored 
in the first possession of the second 
half to give the Tritons a two-goal lead, 
but they were unable to hold off the 
Lions for much longer.

After six-on-five scores from each 
team, the Tritons held a 7-5 lead when 
LMU began its attack. The Lions 
scored the next two goals to tie the 
game, taking away the Tritons’ lead for 
the first time in the second half.

With less than one minute left in 
regulation and the game tied at nine, 
LMU drew an ejection on the Tritons. 
The Lions dealt the decisive blow with 
42 seconds left in the game, scoring as 
their six-on-five opportunity expired. 

Playing on the back end of UCSD’s 
weekend games, the Tritons were 
undoubtedly affected by the extended 
game against the Gauchos the day 
before.

“There’s no question we had some 
tired people,” Harper said. “We’re never 
happy with losing but I was happy with 
our effort and play against LMU con-
sidering what we went through against 
UCSB.”

What the Tritons went through 
against the Gauchos was worse than 
just an average loss in overtime. 
Playing without junior two-meter 
defender Steven Donohoe, who is tied 
for the most goals on the season for the 
Tritons, UCSD actually held the lead 
for most of the game. 

UCSD jumped out to a 4-2 lead 
at halftime and held on to the two-
goal advantage heading into the fourth 
quarter. After the Gauchos scored 
another goal, the Tritons looked as if 
they would be able to hold their one-

ball on the offensive side of the field, 
firing six shots on goal with one slip-
ping into the net. Overall, head coach 
Brian McManus was displeased with 
the girls’ performance, but there’s not 
much they could have done when the 
Urban Knights packed 10 behind the 
halfline.

“It’s difficult to play when they 
packed everyone in one half of the 
field,” he said. “The only thing you 
can do against that is be patient and 
put the ball away when you got the 
chance. We didn’t play very well but 
we got the result and we’ll take it.”

The Tritons will have another 
week of rest before they suit up for 
the final two games of the regular 
season. UCSD will travel to rival Cal 
State San Bernardino, which defeated 
the Tritons 1-0 in double overtime 
earlier in the season, and Cal Poly 
Pomona, which UCSD toppled 2-0 
on Sept. 26. 

Belak-Berger said the team will 
go through its usual routine before 
the weekend’s game, but needs to get 
focused earlier than normal.

“These are two really big games 
for us,” she said. “We’ll do the same 
stuff we always do. We’re psyched 
for [the rematch against Cal State 
San Bernardino] because it is one 
of our only losses and it happened 
at home. We don’t usually lose at 
home so we want to beat them on 
its field.” 

Not only will the final two 
matches include a grudge match, but 
they’ll ultimately determine where 
the Tritons rank in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association and 
where they will be seeded come 
conference playoffs.

McManus could not stress 
enough how important these last 
two games of the season are.

“They’re massive,” he said of 
the games. “If we win, we take the 
politics out of seeding and we defi-
nitely make it to NCAA Regionals 

even if we don’t win the conference 
tournament. Lose once, then we’ll 
probably have to win the confer-
ence tournament.”

McManus believes that CSUSB 
is playing for its season in the last 
two games and, if the Tritons can 
knock off the Coyotes, they will 
most likely eliminate CSUSB from 
playoff contention. 

Since the Coyotes beat the 

Tritons on UCSD’s home field in 
overtime earlier this season, the 
Tritons wouldn’t mind returning 
the favor. 

After they play out the regular 
season, the Tritons will return home 
to host the CCAA Championships 
on Nov. 7-9.

get to play at home.” 
In the first half, UCSD con-

trolled the tempo and the ball as 
the Academy of Art’s lone chance 
came off a steal. The Urban Knight 
forward intercepted the pass from 
the Triton defender and raced up 
field shooting from the top of the 
box. But McGovern smothered the 
shot, thwarting the best opportuni-
ty for the Academy of Art to score 
on UCSD’s defense.

On the other side of the ball, 
the Tritons had multiple scoring 
opportunities in the first half with 
many coming off the foot of junior 

midfielder Alexia Zatarain on cor-
ner kicks. A pair of headers as well 
as a Triton free kick were captured 
by the Academy of Art goalkeeper 
to prevent the Tritons from scor-
ing.

UCSD’s other chances came in 
the 15th and 31st minutes. First, 
it was Zatarain receiving the pass 
from senior midfielder Laura 
Borenstein on the right side, juking 
a defender and sending a laser to 
the near post, which was caught by 
the Urban Knight goalkeeper. Then 
senior midfielder Kelly Mayo took 
an open shot from the right wing, 

only to watch the ball float over the 
crossbar.

Belak-Berger said Mayo’s return 
after suffering a nearly season-end-
ing injury has really helped the 
team.

“[Mayo] brings a lot of expe-
rience onto the field,” she said. 
“When she comes in games she is 
fired up and talks. She is an impor-
tant factor and it’s really good to 
have her back.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER — Just in time 
for Halloween, the No. 22 Tritons 
avoided their own Urban Knight-
mare to beat the defensive-minded 
Academy of Art University in its 
inaugural year.

It was fitting that senior forward 
Natasha Belak-Berger scored the 
game’s lone goal on Senior Day 
while senior goalkeeper Jessica 
McGovern tallied her eighth shut-
out on the season, leading the 
Tritons to a 1-0 victory over the 
Urban Knights.

UCSD’s goal came when fresh-
man midfielder Shelby Wong 
sprinted up the left sideline and sent 
a beautiful centering pass to Belak-
Berger, who touched it through two 
Urban Knight defenders to the far 
post and into the back of the net. 
The score was Belak-Berger’s 11th 
of the year; she has now scored in 
five of the team’s last seven matches 
and she leads the team in goals and 
points.

The nonconference win didn’t 
affect the team’s league standing 
but did improve the Tritons’ overall 
record to 13-2-2 as the team moved 
back into the top 25 of the NCAA/
Adidas Coaches Poll after dropping 
out Sept. 19.

“It’s a weird feeling that four 
years are already over,” Belak-
Berger said. “But [Senior Day] 
wasn’t our last home game. Hosting 
the CCAA Championships is great

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
No. 16 Tritons bounced back after 
falling to No. 14 Cal State Los Angeles 
last week, taking down conference 
foes San Francisco State and Cal State 
Monterey Bay respectively on Oct. 
24 and Oct. 25. In the first game, the 
Tritons had to hold off the upset-
minded San Francisco State team in 
five sets 22-25, 25-21, 21-25, 25-18, 
16-14 before coming together the 
following night to sweep Cal State 
Monterey Bay 25-17, 25-13, 25-21. 

UCSD improved its overall record 
to 17-4 and its conference record to 11-
3, remaining in a tie for second place 
behind No. 2 Cal State San Bernardino 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. 

Before the game, the Tritons held a 
9-0 all-time record against the Otters 
of Cal State Monterey Bay (7-17, 3-11 
CCAA). A 10th win seemed likely after 
the first two sets. Freshman outside 
hitter Katie Condon led the way for the 
Triton charge, finishing the opening set 
with seven kills in nine attempts. As 
a result of Condon’s play, UCSD took 
an 11-8 lead midway through the first 
game and never looked back. Senior 
outside hitter Rebecca Bailey contrib-
uted a kill to extend the lead to eight 
points at 20-12 and the Tritons took the 
set on consecutive serves by redshirt-
freshman defensive specialist Roxanne 
Brunsting. 

The Tritons dominated the sec-
ond set, holding Cal State Monterey 
Bay to a negative hitting percentage.

CROSS COUNTRY — Springing 
back into action over the week-
end, the Tritons returned to 
San Bernardino to compete 
in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Conference 
Championships, with the men 
claiming second place in the 8,000-
meter event and the women snag-
ging third place in the 6,000-meter 
event. Facing some tough competi-
tion, the harriers ultimately battled 
Chico State University in their 
attempt to finish strong. This time 
around, however, that battle proved 
to be more elusive as the Wildcats 
placed eight men in the top 10  
along with five women in the top 
nine for the 6,000-meter event.  

As the only Triton to crack the 
men’s top 10, senior Jake LeVieux 
turned in a time of 26:08 to earn 
ninth place, while junior Max 
Mullender and freshman Jeremy 
Riley seized 13th and 17th place, 
respectively.    

“I was really happy with how 
some of our runners stepped up and 
filled the holes,” head coach Nate 
Garcia said in regard to his team’s 

performance. “Max Mullender and 
Jeremy Riley had good days for us. 
We got into some good individual 
battles and I was very proud to see 
how the guys fought through the 
second half of the race.” 

Garcia said the results provide 
encouragement for the Tritons’ next 
race, the NCAA West Regional, 
which will be held at UCSD on 
Nov. 8. 

According to Mullender, the 
team has reached a level of stability 
in both its preparation and skill. 

“For regionals I think our team 
needs to be healthy and we need to 
all have a good day because there’s 
nothing we can really adjust at this 
point,” he said.

Following his success in this 
race, Riley is set on sticking to his 
game plan. 

“My strategy is to start out 
relaxed and to keep moving up 
through the last half,” he said. 
“That’s what I did this race and I 
was able to finish well.”

For the women, sophomore Bre 
Schofield opened things up once 
again as she sprinted for a third-
place finish with a time of 21:55. 
The next four Tritons finished in a 
cluster as freshman Elena Inouye, 
senior Jessica DiMascio, senior 
Amanda Keuhn and sophomore 
Brianna Alban rounded out the 
scoring for UCSD, placing 18th, 
21st, 22nd and 23rd respectively. 

Inouye, who clocked in at 23:12, 

The Triton men finish 
second behind Chico 
State while the women 
settle for third in a field 
of 11 teams.

MEN’S WATER POLO — Los0ing a 
game because of a last-minute goal 
from an opponent is tough for any team 
to stomach. Having it happen twice 
in one weekend is enough to shake 
even the best of clubs. The Tritons 
experienced the worst on the road last 
weekend when they fell to two ranked 
opponents on last-minute or sudden-
death goals.

During one of the toughest week-
ends on its schedule, the No. 7 UCSD 
men’s water polo team fell to No. 8 UC 
Santa Barbara 10-9 in the fifth overtime 
period on Oct. 24 before being dealt a 
loss of the same score by No. 6 Loyola 
Marymount University on Oct. 25. 
With the losses, UCSD’s record drops 
to 14-8 and 3-3 against Western Water 
Polo Association opponents.

The two matches also mark the 
fourth time in five games that the 
Tritons have played in one-goal games 
or found themselves in overtime. The 
hotly contested matches could be a sign 
of how close the top few teams in the 
nation are when it comes to talent.

“It’s a great year for parity in water 
polo,” head coach Denny Harper said. 
“Even No. 1 USC has seen some close 
games. LMU almost beat them in over-
time a couple of weeks ago.”
