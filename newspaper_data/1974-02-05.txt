The Rising Abortion Controversy 
By Mary Howard 

According to Shi rley Chisolm abortion 
is " the most widely used method of birth 
control in the world today ." Abortion is 
al 0 the most controversial method of 
birth control. Most of this controversy 
~t ms from the strong moral , po litical , 
and ocial beliefs aroused by the word 
"abortion ." 

rrom the moment of conception, a is 
we ll known, all the necessary in-
formation i present for the embryo to 
dev lop into a human being . According 
to Daniel Callahan in Abortion : Law, 
Choice, and Morality, outlines of organs 
are not apparent until the third week, 
and di cernable activity in the brain 
r annot be recorded by an EEG until the 
eighth week . At that time, Callahan says, 
the d veloping embryo is defined as a 
fetus 

The structure of the brain is complete 
at the twelfth week, while the time of the 
fi rst feta l movements felt by the mother, 
oft n called "quickening", is atter 
thirteen to sixteen weeks of develop-
ment, although movem ent can be 
detected earl ier . 
"Viabi lity" is a somewhat ambiguous 

word referring to the fetus ' ability to live 
on Its own sy tems, defined by Callahan 
as occurring at approximately twenty-s ix 
weeks, although there are cases of 
twenty-week-old babies who have 
<;u rvived. uch evidence, concludes 
ROilnne Shamsky and Fran Schroedl of 
the Right to Life Political Action 
Committee, demonstrates that "viability" 
I determin d as much by the technical 
far llities pre nt at the time of birth as by 
th~ fetus ' own lif support system . 

Thus thi strictly biological data does 
not provide a self-evident answ r to the 
question of "Where does human life 
begin?" The answer to this question 
depends on each individual ;s antecedent 
definition ~human", which is cru ial in 
determining whether abortion is the 
deliberate destruction of another human 
life or whether it i imply part of a 
woman's right to control her own body. 

Th traditional Catholic view, as 
presented by rather Warren Rouse, a 
co l um n i st for the Southern Cross 
newspap r, is that a human sou l is fused, 
by God, into the zygote at the moment of 
conception . Therefore, any attempt to 
destroy this zygote, such as the morning-
after pill or the IUD, is condemned by 
the Catholic Church . However, Cardinal 
Cushing of Boston, and other Roman 
Cathol ic authorities, have said that 
Catholics do not nt: d a federal law to 
uphold their moral principles . 

In audition to trying to define when a 
life can l;e -::alled "human", there is also 
the problem of deciding when the fetus' 
life becomes as important as the 
mother's l ife, and when its rights to its 
life, or potential life, transcend the 
mother's right to control her body and 
her life. 

The groups which have supported the 
mother's rights over those of the 
developing fetus are the American Civil 
Liberties Union and women 's 
organizations like the National 
Organization of Wom n . The position of 
the ACLU is that abortion law , first, 
deny the mother the right to decide 
whether and when to have a child, 

econd, deny her the right of privacy, 
third, deny physician their right to 
practice, in a cordance with their 
profe sional obligations, by requiring 
th m to refrain from a medical procedure 
whose failure to p rform would be the 
equival nt of malpra ti ce in many cases, 
and, fourth , d ny to women the right of 
dec iding how th ir bodies can be used 
without due process of law. Becky 
Grothaus, from the N.O.W also holds 
thi position , maintaining the decision to 
have an abortion is a personal one, over 
which the state has no authority . The 
principles of th woman involved should 
b the chief crit ria for her decision 

This idea of th woman 's right to 
control her (wm body formed the baSIS 
for the Supreme Court decision of 
January 22, 1973 which prohibited any 
tate regulation of the woman 's decision 

during the first thrt:e months of 
pregnancy, regulat ion during the second 
trimester would be to safeguard the l ife 
and hea lth of the mother only, and, in 
the third trimester, abortion may be 
proscribed by the state except in cases 
where the life and health of the mother 
are in dang r. The legal foundation for 
this decision was in the Interpretation of 
the 1st, 4th , 5th , 9th, and 14th amend-
ments to the Constitution Consequently, 
in order for pro-life organizations to 
reverse this decision, new amendm nt 
to the Constitution must be passed . 

According to Jan Gleson, head of the 
Reproductive Task Force of the NOW, 
and a member of Catholics for Free 
Choi e, lhr e amendment have been 
conlinued on page 7

Third College students Fr d Cook, 24,

his presentation with the 
promise that, "the com-

The U.T.e. Associate's 
repre entative said that , 
" housing will be built as 
soon as commercia l 
building is completed." The 
purpose of the delay is to 
present residents from 
being bothered by con-
stru ction noise . The 
housing would consist of "a 
minimum of 300 units", 
including " low rise" units in 
the S30-40,OOO price range 
and "high rise" units in a 
"higher price range" (over 
S40,OOO). 'We will do our 
best" to meet balanced 
housing needs, Gilman said,

private sector can't do the 
job alone. He hopes that

Dorm Brawl at UCSB 

A Friday night party last week at UC Santa Barbara 
turned into a Saturday morning brawl at San Rafael 
dorm on the UCSB Campus. Il.fter the smoke cleared it 
revealed a smashed window, broken trees, a demolished 
bicycle, and one arr~: 

The excitement betan when ten uninvited males from 
off campus showed up at a party on the second floor of 
San Rafael Hall .' With no apparent provocation, the 
unexpected guests bepn pickin, fi,hts with a few of 
the party-goers. One student was hit, and a fire ex-
tinguisher glass encasement was broken by anot'her of 
the rowdies. 

. Someone from the third floor decided to cool off the 
action with a bucket of water which sent some of the 
party-<:rashers on their way to the third floor to retaliate . 
At th is point, one student called the campus police . 

A~er the call to the police all but one of the crashers , 
left the scene. The remaining man followed the phone 
caller to his room on the seventh floor, forced his way in 
and began - pummeling the student. Neighboring 
residents, hearing the scuffle, proceeded to subdue the 
assailant until the campus police could arrive . 

The alleged assailant , who by now was bleeding 
profusely from his hand and "babbling incoherently," 
was arrested and removed from the scene by an am-
bulance. 

Other incidents of the evening included the dumping 
of a resident assistant's bicycle off the fifth floor, and an 
unscheduled fire alarm. "All in all," said one resident. 
"it was a great party." 

Good News and Bad News 

At a meeting of the Sacramento Comstock Club, iast 
week Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti said there is both 
good news and bad news about the energy crisis but 
that most of all there is no new news from the major oil 

panies. 
"The good news," the Speake. said, "is that local 

governments should realize increased revenues from 
property taxes based on the rising price of oil. 

'We expect local governments in the state to gain 
from SSO to S60 million in property tax revenue ." 

"The bad news of the energy crisis is that fuel con-
tinues to be unavailable or hard to get and prices 

I continue to'dimb. In the meant!me, oil company profits 
are enormous. 

50S: Jobs in Europe 

Any student between the ages of 17 and 27 can obtain 
a temporary paying student job in Europe through a new 
mail application system. Jobs, working papers, room 
and board arrangements and other travel documents are 
processed in advance . 

The work is done on a non-profit basis by the 50S-
Student Overseas Services, a student run organization 
speciali Lillg in helping American students in Europe for 
the pas ~ 16 years. 

Stane ard wages are paid in addition to the profitable 
advant<:'ge of free room and board which is provided 

, with ea .. h hote!, re<nrt and restaurant job. Most jobs are 
in Switlerland, France, Austria and Pili t-, of Alpine 
Germar y in ski resorts during the winter months , and in

the spr na and summer months .

CALPIRG Seeks Student Aid 
CALPIRG -has developed an innovative funding 

mechanism which will be tested this Spring quarter at 
UCSD . This system will not only provide a stable source 
of funding, but will allow each student to individually 
aid CALPIRG . 
The California Public Interest Research Group 

(CALPIRG) is run and supported entirely by students. 
Each student body, at the five coUeges which compose 
CALPIRG, has set up its own meGhanism for collt,!ction . 

Money collected at the colleges is then pooled and 
used to pay for projects and professional help . These 
projects are picked by a student board in such fields as 
the environment, consumer interest, discri.mination or 
government. 

For the last two years students at UCSD have supported 
CALPIRG through student government . This year the 
Undergraduate Student Council IT.U.S.c.) allocated 
money for Fall and Winter quarters to CALPIRG . But a 
new system will be initiated this Spring . 
This new system will allow each student to individually 

decide whether or not to support CALPIRG at UCSD. A 
CALPIRG fee card will go into each Spring registration 
packet along with the registration cards. Students will 

I be able to fill out the card and pay it along with their 
regular fees . CALPIRG will then mail a membership card 

Career Planning and 
Placement: Successfully 

Aiding Students 
I Career Plann ing and 
Placement is a "resource for 
career information," ac-
<ording to its cordinator, 
Maxine Bailey . " We' re 
offerin g technigues for 
getting out the information, 
but it 's up to the student to 
follow through ." 
The center, located in the 

sixth floor fo the Hunanities 
and Social Science building 
at Muir, offers students 
assistance in each phase of 
job-seeking . Its services 
range frpm a self· 
instructional career 
planning library to in· 
dividua l aid in determing 
the type of job most 
.desirable . 

When students don't know 
what occupations they wish 
to pursue, the center at-
I tempts to expose them to 
the available possibilities. 

"We're not really coun-
se lors, " sai d Michael 
Hulfachor, assis tant and 
UCSD GRADUATE . "We're 
helping to turn people on to 
information . We're helping 
students out, but we 're not 
really telling them what to 
do ." 
Another aspect of the 

cen ter is its workshop 
program . One of its main 
·efforts is teaching students 
job-seeking techniques . For 

'three weeks, students are 
given instruction in resume 

writing and in interviewing. 
An on-campus interviewing 
program is also used to 
familiarize;' students with 
procedures. 

Career Planning and 
Placement offers workshops 
in occupational surveys 
also . About 14 people 
participate in the sessions 
which are directed by 
various progessionals . 

Recent cuts have taken, 
their toll on the center 's 
ability to reach as many 
students as its organizers 
would like. but its Teacher 
Placement program is still 
one of the strongest in the 
area . Otherwise, there was 
little direct placement 
previously given . The Early 
Match System was begun to 
alleviate the problem by 
bringing stude nt s' 
qualifications to the at · 
tention of more employers. 
The system g ives 
prospective e mployers the 
opporfllnity to look at ' 
students' placement file s.' 
Hopefully, the result will be ' 
more scheduled interviews. 

Ms. Bailey said she hoped 
more students would use 
the center. "They feel the, 
need for some kind of 
occupational planning and 
placement ," she said . "And 
we're able to give it to 
them ." 

back La the student. 
CALPIRG members de~loped this new approach for 

two reasons. First, the old system did not give students a 
direct voice in the spending of their money . Though all 
T.U.S.C. members were elected by the students, some 
students may not always agree with their represen· 
ta~ives' .. opjnions. 
Secondly, by asking r .U.s .c. for money, CALPIRG was 

taking monev away from other deserving stude nt 
groups. Due to the size of CALPIRG , and its many 
projects, other clubs could not be fully funded . Thus a 
voluntary fee card system was set up. 
The membership fee for the Spring quarter for 

CALPIRG will be S1 .00. The Registrar will accept either a 
separate check for this amount or a registration fee 
check made out for one dollar extra . To find out more 
about this system, (students can) call CALPIRG at 236-
1509. 

This new system will allow CALPIRG to mail out 
CALPIRG membership cards and bulletins to its 
members . In addition it will help make the funding 
system reflect student needs more directly . BV 
collecting this fee, CALPIRG will be able to contin 
and start more projects in the students' interest. 

UCSD to Have 
Alumni Association 

By Cuol Phillips 

A new program , The 
Alumni and Friends 
Association , is being for· 
med here to further 
"develop student assistance 
programs," according to its 
director, June B. Smith 

She believes the "social 
organization " attitude 
toward such groups is 
fading . "Strong alumni 
associations are vita l to the 
life of the UniverSity," she 
said . "Times and 
associations have changed. 
I would think our alumni 
would reflect the c hange. 
The groups are now more a 
liason between the 
University and its student 
services and the alumni ." 
She added that even at 

Berkeley , the strongest and 
oldest of the UC alumni 
associations, "our concept 
of alumni and friends has 
been very popular." 
Current student s ca n 

benefit through the group 's 
ability to match its 
resources in such areas as 
job assi tance and ' legal 
advice, to their needs . 
"Alumni can say things and 
represent us to their friends 
in different ways than we 
can," she said . "They carry 
more weight ." 

In what she termed a 
philosophical sense, Ms. 
Smith said the association 
would perpetuate contact 

between alumni and

Help Marijuana 

Initiative 

To qualify the Marijuana Decriminalization Initiative 
for the November ballot, 120,000 more signatures are 
needed before February 20. 

Unless many students make a big effort now, the 
initiative won't make it; this would be especially galling 
since such a measure stands a better chance of passage 
than ever before. The drive needs people to carry 
petitions and man tables at Revelle and Muir Plazas. 
You can sign the petition or pick one up at the Triton 
Times Office. Signing the petition does not imply an 
endorsement of decriminalization , but rather insists 
that the people of California be given a rhance to vote 
on an important and controversial issue The San Diego 
headquarters for the MariJuana Decrlmlnalilation 
Initiative IS 4753 Voltaire Stre t, 222-7744 or 224 3274

A Liberated Date 
A true story 

A date with a " liberated" 
woman . Telephone co n-
versation : 

Male : You consider yourself 
a liberated woman? 
Female : Well , don't you 
think I've been acting 
liberated? 
M : Isn't the philosophy one 
of socio-economic 
equality? 
F· Yes, I shou ld get paid the 
same wage for the same 
work. 
M ' Hell Yes. But) was just 
thinking of the social part 
for right now 
F Aren't I social? (A little 
coquet ry here) 
M When was the la t time 
you called me to go out 7 
F. Well, you're so hard to 
get a hold of . 
M : Bullshit. There is always 
5Omeone at my lab or house 
to take a message. 
r : Weill Just don't feel right 
calling you 
M : Well , why can't you 
handle half th hassle? 
Males always must do the 
asking 
F. O.K. I' ll take you out to a 
dinner and a movie 
M ' Hey look I don't mean to 
hassle you 
F. Well, you always take me 
out. Why shouldn't I take 
you out? 
M Well, ) don't think you 
know what you're getting 
into. (pause) Frankly, I 
don't think you could pull it 
off. 
F' What's that mean? 
M : Let's just drop it. 
F. No, I'm going to take an 
MCP out and show him the 
roles can be switched . 
M : I'd really enjoy it. I 
could really get Into letting 
the girl do all the hassling . 
F' Woman! 
M ' O.K. But I still don't 
think you could really pull 
off a night out doing all of 
the hassling. 
r. We'll see. 
M ' My roommate wants to 
use the phon E' . 
r When ar you gOing 
to (omp over so ) can take 
you out? 
M Aren't you gOing to 
come and pick me up? 
) I don't have a carl 

M: . That's hassle number 
one. 
F: Its much easier for you to 
come over than for me to 
borrow a car. 
M : Look, are you taking me 
out or am I taking you out? 
F: Don't be ridiculous. 
M: A car is one of the th ings 
males always have to 
provide . One of the small 
obstacles I spoke of earli er. 
F: O .K., Mep, I' ll borrow a 
car. 

To shorten the story, the 
woman finally got herself a 
car (from another male) . 
She insisted on a good 
restaurant. ) tried to suggest 
a less expensive place but 
to no avail. I must admit 
dinner was good but she 
stiffed the walt r "A dollar 
tip is enough!" She ob-
viously never worked as a 
bus boy to satiate some 
high school girl's whims . 

The fuel tank was low so 
she put in a dollars worth 
of gas. The reserve light 
didn't go out so a r turn trip 
was necessary . I should 
note that ) usually have 
sense and consideration to 
insure no transportat ion 
problems will be en-
countered but ) kept my 
peace . "This car is really a 
gas guzzl r ." They all are, 
baby 

A movie was then in 
order I suggested the Rox 
or Frtday night flicks . She 
insisted on a Hotel Circle 
Cinema . "You won 't be able 
to say this wasn 't a great 
evening" I didn't mention 
that I sti II had to be a witty 
conversationa li st while 
dodging drunks on the 
freeway . That's rightiolks, I 
was driving! 

At the movie entrance I 
slipped her a five . I did this 
because during dinner I 
noticed her only capi tal was 
a twenty. " I don't un-
derstand, I started out with 
twenty dollars!" Its nice to 
know your price . She still 
had to fill her tank up to the 
starting level before 
returning the car and had to 
buy me munchies in the 
movie ThiS would bring the 
total to $25 " I n v r knew 
It cost so much I" And she 
cou ld catch a snOO7e while 
) drove home 

HaVing been, In one aspect or another, a source of 
comic relief for many years now, I feel that ) am 
qualified to comment on the almo t total absence of 
leVity her!' at Revelle Agreed, maybe Organi

Is It humor itself that is not revered, or mer('ly the fau 
that it is out of place, seeming ly obsolete, In the at-
mosphere of competition and cramming (whether it be 
rramming for a midterm or just cramming into a Physics 
- "NaLS i " - 2A lecture)? Oddly enough, the Prof!'ssors 
have b n the only a uth ntic cata lysts in th preser-
vation and promotion of humor (good or bad) 

The Professors are stockpiled with an inexhaustible 
library of quips and puns (punishment), each with the 
" ring" that th y've b n used every opportunity Sin e 
Inception (immaculate or notl . Neverthel ss, these 
topica l innuendos lighten the lives of "the troops". Even 
If they do come across like a vain attempt at a Bob Hope 
Impression, I feel that they are appreciated at least as a 
diversion, if not as comedy. 

I would feel insecure about my material if I were a 
professor, though . Who can trust the reaction of a 
laughter-starved, overworked en li sted Triton (who are 
the Tritons?) who is also at the mercy of the entertainer 
for a grade (in most cases)? 

When you ask yours If whether a witty comment like 
"One man's meat is another man's Persian" was really 
necessary or not, satisfy your anxieties With the com-
forting thought that at least helshe is trying to keep the

to grin broadly as he walts

man has entered the

men have knocked him to 
the floor and are frisking 
him vigorously. They 
haven't found anything yet -
apparently he is all right; so 
they are letting him g/) . He 
appears rather frantic, he's 
searchin g his pockets , 
apparently in vain, now. he 
is going up to the President 
and let's ee if we can catch 
his words" 

"Mr. President I'm in a

dime. I wear) voted for 
you last time, honest . 
Please, I need a dime!" 

"L t no one say that 
Rfchard Nixon wouldn't

"The President IS 
reaching into his pocket

giving it to the man ." 

" Now don't spend it all In

"God bless you, Mr. 
President" 

" Dan, when was the last 
time that you heard such 
I vity from the President?" 

"The last time ) can 
remem ber was at the 
funeral of heckers in '58, 
when he said that he was 
'dog gone sorry' . Now Ron 
Ziegler is out here and he 
has a comment to make." 

" I think that it is 
remarkable that the 
President, who had a dime 
and could have used a 
private pay toilet, elected 
instead to use the public 
one, and when someone 
else needed that dime, the 
President gave it gladly . 
That shows the kind of man 
th at the President is - a man 
who cares more for others 
than he does for himself. 
That's the source of his 
greatness ."

here. There's the flush . In 
just a moment the President

IS monitoring the special 
CBS microcamera placed 
Inside the top of the

"Thanks, Mike . The 
President has entered the

behind him , bolting it 
securely . He is still stan-
ding, and has pushed back

at his watch . This IS 
remarkable! The watch is 
no longer the Spiro Agnew 
watch that the President 
has been wearing for so 
many years .,. it seems to be 
a Gerald Ford . Yes, the 
President is standing there, 
watching the seconds tick 
off on his new Gerald Ford 
watch ." 

" That reminds me, Dan , of 
a story that I heard a couple 
of days ago at the 
Watergate hearings. )t 
seems that the President 
asked Uoyds of London if 
they would insure him for 
the retention of his 
preside n cy . Lloyd 's 
suggested that if he wanted 
Insurance, he should go to 
Gerald r ord So that's what 
h did ." 

"Thanks, Walter . Th IS IS 
remarkable; the President 
has made no move to 
perform a natural function 
of any kind . He IS stdl 
standing upright, fully 
dressed, looking at the 
watch . Now his attention 
seems to be distracted by 
something on the wall. He 
seems to b visibly an-
noyed ; he 's scowling 
deeply, and his jowls art' 
hanging about two inches 
lower." 

"Do you have any idea 
what might be the cause of 
this upset Dan 7" 

"Yes I 'do, Mike . ) sur-

minutes ago, and I believe 
that the President is 
reactin g to several remarks 
on the stall walls . ) n the

further than that." 

"Do these remarks 
concern the President 
himself?" 

"Some of them do, Mike. 
The President seems to be 
regaining his composure 
He's looking at his watch 
again . Now he is rolling the

forth . And now .. yes, he 
has flushed the toilet. The 
President looks pleased,

Biola Trounced, 64-43 
Last rriday night the 

T ntons played one of their 
better games of the year as 
they blew Biola off of the 
court . It was a well played 
game on the part of the 
Tritons as they dominated 
the play at both ends of the 
court in winning &4-43. 

cu toff blue jeans. 
The only person there that 

managed to get the crowd 
going yelling was none 
other than Leo Dejohn. As a 
one man cheering section 
he managed to outdo all the 
cheerleaders by himself. 
When asked if he wantea to 
be a cheerleader Leo said 

that he just didn't have the 
physical attributes that one 
comes to expect of a 
cheerleader. He also sa id 
that he (and possibly a 
couple of friends) would be 
at the next home game to 
help generate a little en-
thusiasm for the home team 
(for those of you still 
wondering that's U(SD).

,Second in Nation 

Softball Season Starts 

Leading the Triton attack 
were Paul Trainer (19 
points, 13 rebounds) and 
Joe Coit (16 points, 8 
rebounds) . The other 
starters all played well and 
contributed heavily to the 
Triton cause. Steve Kircher 
did an excellent job in 
directing the offense as well 
as scoring 8 points. Steve 
Higgins displayed excellent 
hustle on defense and 
offense, scoring 7 points 
and forCing mistakes. 
George Calhoun played 
well, scoring 8 points 
despite playing injured. 

During the fall and winter 
months, the UCSD sailing 
team has been quietly 
winning their races and 
taking firsts in major 
regattas . When they won 
first place in their league, it 
earned them an invitation 
to the Sugar Bowl In-
vitational in which they 
were named the second 
ranking college sailing team 
in the United States, 

The team was given the 
honor of being invited to 
the Sugar Bowl Regatta 
along with eight other top 
colleges in the nation. After 
overcoming the usual 
financial obstacles , of 
which the school gave no 
support, Dick Davis, Joan 
Odell, Don Wyatt and Ed 
Trevelyan represented 
UCSD in its first . national 
sailing event. In their initial 
sailing venture away from 
the California coast, these 
four cruised into second 
place . Tulane , a New 
Orlean .. college, placed

Monday found BooG'S 
BABOONS again routinely 
demolishing the hapless 
Dogmeatz. If there was a 
correlation between idle 
rhetoric and athletic ability 
the DOGMEATZ would n~ 
doubt be contenders for a 
new National League 
franchise . Unfortunately 
this is not the case. Of 
course, BOOG'S BABOONS 
had the distinct advantage 
over DOGMEATZ because 
they were under the 
leadership of the head 
baboon , our own fearless 

intramural director, Lee 
Johnson. 
For those of you interested 

enough to read this far, the 
baseball season has really 
and truly started here at 
UCSD. The games are 
played onMondaY,Tuesday 
and Friday afternoons at 4 
and 5 p.m . 
Two leagues compose this 

activity (known as One-
Pitch Softball); they are in 
honor of Bob Gibson and 
Dean Chance. A subtle 
difference in their hitting

one out, baseball scholars. 

Comprising the Bob

are such powerhourses as 
the above mentioned 
Boog 's Baboons and 
Dogmeatz also joined by 
Krakatoa, Entrophy and the 
Boat Folk . Though the 
names are strange, the 
players are top-notch, or so 
they say . 

In a single afternoon, you 
could see such gems as 
Mike Robarts dropping a 
routine fly ball , Gary 
Yokota muffing a two mph 
grou nder and ALL-CIF 
player Mike Amaranthus 
striking out twice . 

Fences have been erected 
for the muscle boys, but I'll 
give you an inside tip. My 
grandmother and four of 
her friends could power the 
ball out of that park with 
relative ease. 

I've been informed that 
while playing the Boat Folk, 
you should never turn your 
back ; they are know to 
strike from behind!

In the first half the Tritons 
started fast, opening up an 
8 point lead and coasting in 
at the half . Joe Coit 
dominated the first half, 
scoring 10 points and 
controlling the boards . 
Coming off a 7 point lead at 
the half the Tritons literally 
annihilated Biola in the 
second half. Biola tried a 
full court press, but the 
Tritons playing patiently 
and not forcing passes beat 
the press easily with Traine 
getting most of his points 
on lay ins. 

Coach Bill Reeves was 
especially pleased with his 
teams second half play. 
Noting that in past games 
the Tritons had blown 
halftime leads to lose close 
games; when the team got 
careless in the second half, 
Reeves said that this was 
the best second half that his 
team had played all year. 
Instead of collapSing in the 
second half the Tritons took 
it to Biola for two full 
halves of basketball . 

The cheerleaders also 
managed to show up, but I 
don't think it was worth 
their efforts as they . 
managed to lead a measly 
three cheers all night. They 
did however display some 
stunning new outfits

In October, Ed Trevelyan 
and Dick Davis took first 
place in UCSD's first regatta 
in the major Pacific coast 
division, the North-South 
Regatta . I neluded "were 
many schools from the bay 
area and Southern 
California . 

A month later, during 
Thanksgiving, the sailing 
team won the AII-Cal in 
Newport. leaving UCLA and 
UCI in second and' third 
places . The AII-Cal regatta 
consists of three divisions, 
the scores being the sum of 
these races. Scipper Dic & 
Davis placed second in the 
A division, as did Ed 
Trevalyan in the B division . 
I n the all girl C division, 
Peggy Brown took first 
place, earning the 
necessary points for UCSD 
to win the regatta . 

The sailing team is holding 
their first major meeting 
Tuesday, the 12th of 
February, at 7 :00 pm in the 
P,E. classroom to encourage 
more students to join . To 
carry this goal further, the 
current members of the 
sailing team plan to give all 
newcomers a chance to 
gain experience in racing in 
a collegiate league. During 
a major portion of this 
year's Southern Series, the 
best scippers will step aside 
for the new team members. 
Anyone with any kind of 
sailing experience is 
welcome.

Abortion Controversy 
continued from pilJe 1 

proposed by the S15 million lobby of pro-
life groups in Washington . 

The Whitehurst amendment would 
make abortion a matter subject to 
regulation by the individual states, the 
Buckley amendment defines a fetus to be 
a person, and the Hogan amendment 
specifically defines a human being to 
exist at the point of conception, Support 
for pro-abortion groups, according to 
Roanne Shamsky of the Right-to-Life 
group, comes from the Rockefeller and 
Ford Foundations. 

In addition to the constitutional 
amendments, Ms. Gleson claims that the 
pro·life lobby is responsible for other 
money bills introduced in Congress. 
Specifically, the Buckley amendment to 
a social security measure would prohibit 
funds from Medicaid to be used for 
abortion . This, says Gleson, discrim inates 
against the poor and denies them equal 
protection of the law. 

Equal protection of the law, so many 
believe, is also denied to the fetus, 
consequently, a Dr . Bart Heffernan 
petitioned the Illinois legislature to 
become the "fetal protector", or a public 
defender for the rights of the fetus . 

Assuming the rights of the fetus and 
the moral obligation the woman has 
incurred, what can she do? 

She can get counseling. In addition to 
family planning centers and birth control 
clinin, the Pro-life I E'ilgll" of Siln f)iE'go . 

headed by Dr . Pat Evangelo, provides 
this . Although her pregnancy may be 
inconvenient, Father Donovan of the 
Office of Religious Affairs questions the 
wisdom ot placing her convenience over 

r
the possible right of the fetus to life 
Father Donovan and Dr. Evangelo both 

.. criticized the stigma society places on 
the unwed mother, which , coupled with 
welfare laws discouraging large families 
among the poor, tends to encourage 
abortion, Even if the woman herself 
would like to carry the pregnancy to 
term, abortion is often her only feasible 
alternative . Abortion , according to 
Father Donovan, is society's "easy way 
out," and, until social attitudes change, 
pregnancy out of wedlock will be dif-
ficult . 

But what are women to do in the 
meantime? Should the answer, as Ian 
Gleson of the NOW feels is the result of 
restrictive abortion laws, be forced upon 
them by the state? Should the sanctity of 
the life within the woman as Roanne 
Shamsky fears , be subject to her con-
victions? There are many unpleasant 
ramifications to both questions, but one 
was posed by both sides of the abortion 
controversy, seen in a different light in 
each case. That is, should a state or 
individual be allowed to exercise control 
over critical aspects of the life of another 
individual I

On the question of whether the increase in students 
wa going to mean a stricter enforcement of the 25 mile
