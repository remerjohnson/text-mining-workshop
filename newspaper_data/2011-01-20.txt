Student members of the UC 
Movement for Efficient Privatization 
held a “Save Our Dean” Rally in 
support of Dean Christopher Edley at 
UC Berkeley on Jan. 19.

Edley is one of over 200 UC 
executives threatening to sue the UC 
system in the absence of a pension 
increase and of the 36 executives who 
wrote to the Regents on the matter on 
Dec. 9. 

Edley faced scrutiny following the 
letter’s publication by the San Francisco 
Chronicle in which he encouraged 
a “moral and ethical” approach to 
increasing UC executives’ pensions 
that exceed $245,000. 

“UCPD had to show up at the 
rally to protect the pro-Dean Edley 
supporters. Almost no one supported 
what we’re doing. In fact, I don’t think 
one person did,” Steve Johnson* said, 
a spokesperson from Save Our Dean 
who wishes to remain anonymous in 
fear of “retaliation from UC Regents 
and a hostile environment at UC 
Berkeley’s Law School.”

About 25 people participated in the 
rally with about 50 onlookers. There 
were four speakers, including Edley.

“If administrators can’t make an 
unlimited amount of money at the 
UC while they effectively work to 
privatize it, then the privatization of 
the university is not going to happen 
as smoothly,” Johnson said. “We need 
to eliminate the public sphere and turn 
[the UC] over to private enterprise.”

The group of over 200 UC 
executives argued their retirement 
benefits should reflect a percentage 
of their salaries rather than the initial 
$245,000 that has remained capped. 

“No one really feels that he is 
entitled to additional compensation 
during this crisis that the University of 
California finds itself in, and they don’t

The campus carillon that sits atop Geisel Library can play more 
than just the automated chime that marks each hour of the day — in 
fact, in celebration of UCSD’s 50th anniversary, it will play almost 
any song.

Because UCSD has no official song, Arts Library outreach coor-
dinator Scott Paulson said the requests are the only way to get songs 
to play on the bell instrument, which is housed in a bell tower.

“I hope lots of people send song requests,” Paulson said. “These 
personal requests, played in such a public way, are a great way for 
someone to celebrate the 50th [anniversary].”

According to university spokesperson Dolores Davies, short 
concerts will often occur at noon on weekdays for the rest of the 
academic year. 

For the anniversary celebration, the university commissioned 
over 70 composers — music students, professionals and community 
members — to create new chimes for the carillon for $125 each. 

Paulson, who is also a 1984 alumnus, has been the official uni-
versity carillon player since 1994. Before him, no one played the 
carillon and it was only used for its hourly chimes.

Paulson has always taken requests as to what to play on the caril-
lon, which has no operating costs.

“[I’ve been getting requests for] lots of 80s songs for some 
reason,” Paulson said. “Most recently, ‘Don’t Dream It’s Over,’ [by] 
Crowded House.”

Paulson has a diverse song repertoire, which according to 
Davies, can range from songs by Salt n’ Pepa to The Ramones.

Paulson said, while sometimes he does not know the song, he 
may contact the requestor and ask them hum some bars of the song.

Paulson said that he will perform any song that will not be 

ruined by the sound of the carillon, often suggesting alternate songs 
that will sound better in that format.

“The thing about bells and chimes is that there is no such thing 
as a short note,” Paulson said in an e-mail. “Every note is a long, long 
tone and those notes can overlap and interfere with each other, so 
we’ll see what I can do to make your song request sound familiar 
and flattering.”

Paulson said he’s accepting requests because it’s important to 
have student and community involvement in the selection of the 
songs. 

“As an alumnus and a staff member, it’s important to me to cre-
ate opportunities like this,” Paulson said. “My job title at the library 
is outreach coordinator, and this kind of outreach truly reaches out 
to people.”

regents discuss
effects of state 
budget cuts and 
new admissions 

process

T he UC Board of Regents con-vened on Jan. 19 in Price Center West Ballroom to 
discuss a new admissions process 
in addition to the possibilities of 
tuition increases, staff reductions 
and increased non-resident admis-
sions to combat state budget short-
falls.

On the second day of the three-
day meeting, the discussion largely 
focused on the funding challenge 
brought about Gov. Jerry Brown’s 
proposed 2011-12 budget plan 
— which includes a $500-million 
budget cut to the UC system due to 
the state’s $26-billion deficit. 

“Students are real upset,” UC 
President Mark G. Yudof said. “I 
don’t blame them.” 

The meeting began with public 
comment, where members of the 
Coalition of University Employees 
said that if they were allied with 
the International Brotherhood of 
the Teamsters union, they could 
negotiate better contracts. 

Students showed support for 
a holistic admission process and 
thanked the Regents for their 
initiative. Students also came to 
protest budget cuts and asked that 
cuts do not lead to fee increases.

For the rest of the hour, the 
Regents responded to budget 

concerns by the public.
“These cuts will be painful…

for every section of the state,” 
Yudof said. “We have increased fees 
by 40 percent in three years. My 
prediction is that the moment is fast 
approaching that the university will 
not be able to accept all California 
applicants who are eligible.” 

Yudof said the UC campuses 
can admit 20,000 to 30,000 more, 
but they do not have enough state 
support to fund a quality education.

“I take Yudof seriously when 
he says Brown is serious about the 
$500-million cut,” Student Regent 
and UCI senior Jesse Cheng said. 
“We have to move forward and 
continue defending ourselves from 
fee increases and budget cuts.”

Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom 
proposed the creation of an online 
portal for budget suggestions from 
California faculty, student and 
citizens. One regent even suggested 
that sales taxes fund the UC system.

“The University of California 
is an institution of public access,” 
faculty representative Dan Simmons 
said. “Our commitment to the public 
good is one of our primary drivers. 
Our doors must remain open to 
students from all parts, [including] 
low- and middle-income families.”

State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Tom Torlakson called 

the budget cuts “tragic 
trajectories.” 

Vice Chairman of 
the Board of Regents 
Sherry Lansing said 
the UC Regents “must 
concentrate on quality. 
We have to think out 
of the box. The most 
important thing we 
have to think about are 
resources of revenue.”

“We need a ‘Save 
UC’ campaign right 
now,” Regent George M. 
Marcus said. “My son 
will contribute $100,000 
now.” 

He received a round 
of applause after he 
shouted, “Let’s get a 
campaign going. This is 
serious!”

A f t e r w a r d s , 
Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox talked about campus climate, 
noting that 60 more African 
American students and 24 Native 
Americans are enrolling this year.

Fox also spoke about UCSD’s 
access efforts, which include 
overnight events and outreach 
programs to high schools.

Fox noted the need for future 

Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and UC 
President Mark Yudof discuss 
alternative funding for the UC 
system the second day of the 
UC Regents meeting.  Police 

o�cers and hired security kept 
watch of the perimeter 

outside Price Center West 
Ballroom.

Researchers Study Marijuana Effects on HIV-Infected Youth
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Massiel Valenzuela
Staff Writer

Researchers are investigating 
the effects of marijuana use on the 
development of neurological disorders 
in HIV-infected youth.

With the aid of a $4.7-million 
grant from the National Institutes of 
Health, collaborating researchers from 
UCSD, the University of Florida and 
the University of South Florida hope 
to identify blood-based biomarkers — 
markers to track how substance abuse 
alters HIV function and progression 
from within the central nervous system. 

By identifying biomarkers and how 
the combination of HIV and marijuana 
alter neurological pathways in young 
adults, the study hopes to find how 
marijuana use contributes to the 
behavioral decisions made by people, 
from age 18 to 24, infected with HIV.

HIV — a virus that destroys the 
immune system and eventually leads 
to AIDS — currently has no cure, but 
is thought to be affected by chemical 
components in marijuana. 

According to UCSD pediatric 
neuropsychologist Sharon Nichols, 
marijuana is thought to play a role in 
suppressing immune function. 

“It is ... important to understand 
the effects of HIV in the brain in 
adolescents and emerging adults, partly 
because their brains are still developing 
and partly because they are likely to 
be living with HIV for a long time,” 
Nichols said. “Understanding the early 
effects of HIV and how to prevent 
future problems is especially critical. 
[The study] will help us at the basic 
level to lead to better treatments.”

Marijuana affects both mental 
and emotional control, according to 
Nichols — who researches cognitive 
reasoning in HIV-infected adolescents 
who undergo antiretroviral treatment.  

“The big obstacle we face is that 
substance abuse can play a role 
in immune system and cognitive 
functioning,” Nichols said. 

Though antiretroviral drugs exist 
to help alleviate the effects of HIV, 
those infected still experience problems 
with movement and cognition control 

— including dementia — and risk 
spending the rest of their lives with 
impaired cognitive abilities.

The team will study the main 
components of marijuana, THC and 
cannabinoids, to determine how it affects 
the nervous and immune systems.

So far, research found that 30 to 40 
percent of HIV infected adolescents 
also are involved with substance abuse. 
Almost one-third of those infected use 
marijuana on a daily basis. 

There is no current research that 
shows the effects of marijuana use on 
the behaviors of adolescents with HIV, 
even with the prevalence of marijuana 
use among them. To study the effects 
on a molecular level, researchers are 
using a multidisciplinary approach 
over the five years of the study. 

Researchers hope that the three 
branches and their shared results will 
find overlapping data. Researchers 
at UCSD will study how HIV affects 
the brain by looking at cognitive 
processes. USF neurobiologists will 
study cannabinoids’ effects on the 
immune system. Virologists at UF will 

study both HIV-infected and HIV-free 
small blood cells capable of absorbing 
bacteria and small particles.

“This network approach involves 
universities, clinics, etc,” Nichols said. 
“We want to look all through the United 
States. People in California are different 
from New York — they could be using 
different substances across the country.”

The study will include four groups 
of 16- to 25-year-olds picked from 15 
parts of the country.

Close quarters By Kat Truong

as Per usual By Dami Lee



NEWS. THURSDAY,.JANUARY.20,.2011. THE.UCSD.GUARDIAN.3 

The hourly chime is called “The 
Westminster Quarters,” a 1793 melody 
that originates in the Church of St. 
Mary the Great in Cambridge, England. 

The hourly chime is automatically 
played by the carillon and then ampli-
fied through a speaker system located 
outside the library. It is not pre-record-
ed, but Paulson plays other songs live.

The carillon was donated to the 
school in 1989 by Joe Rubinger, who 
was in a retiree learning program at the 
university in the 80s and noticed the 
school did not have any chimes.

Paulson has always and will always 
accept requests. They can be sent to 
him via e-mail at spaulson@ucsd.edu.

This week’s council meeting had a slow start, with half an hour of public input that just consisted 
of college councilmembers introducing 
themselves and thanking council for 
their invitation to the meeting. 

M a r s h a l l 
College Freshman 
Repres ent at ive 
Bryan Cassella 
started a statewide 
campaign called 
reACT to fight 
the proposed 
California budget cuts by sending 
letters send to state officials.

University of California Student 
Association Director Matt Haney 
spoke about issues facing all California 
colleges due to budget cuts.

President Wafa Ben Hassine 
submitted an external news submission 
about Tunisian protests. Four judicial 
members were appointed: Sarah 
Montgomery, Tanner Smith, Sarmad 
Bokhari and Arianna Peregretti.

AVP of College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbit said Marshall College Council 
is planning a visibility week for Week 
4. This Friday, Warren College Council 
will be hosting an Open Mic Night in 
front of Canyon Vista. There will also 
be an all-council mixer on Feb. 8.

AVP of Academic Affairs Desiree 
Prevo complained to her academic 
senators; only a few had been 
responding to her e-mails about a lunch 
planned for Jan. 28 with Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Education Barbara Sawrey.

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu said Sixth College’s Winter 
Game Fest is this weekend. Over 
2,000 people are expected to attend 
— some, apparently, even traveling 
internationally for the gaming 
tournament, which will award a total of 
$7,000 in winnings. 

VP of External Affairs Michael 

Lam encouraged students to apply for 
Student Regent; there is an information 
session on Friday at 3 p.m. in PC East.

AVP of Concerts and Events Brian 
Wong said Winter Triton Festival tickets 
will available this Friday at the box 

office; also the next 
Bear Garden is Feb. 
11. Sheila Binish 
was appointed as 
a staff member for 
his office.

AVP of Local 
Affairs Matthew 

Vu asked council to use gender-neutral 
language during their meetings (such 
as not using the word “guys,” because 
not everyone identifies as male). 

There was a lengthy debate over 
an amendment involving the addition 
of the Inter-Tribal Resource Center 
to Local Affairs documentation. 
Discussions varied over wording and 
the relevance of the amendment. Many 
impassioned speeches were given; after 
one speaker said, “What the fuck?” 
Speaker Meredith Madnick intervened. 
(Ultimately, the amendment passed.)

The meeting moved briskly 
following the hour-long discussion. 
Everyone wanted to go home. I did too.

AVP of Diversity Affairs Alyssa 
Peace introduced her Diversity Affairs 
Respect Campaign. She plans to host 
public forums on diversity all quarter 
long, including prominent anti-racial 
politics guest speaker Tim Wise on Feb. 
16 in Price Center Ballrooms at 7 p.m.

Clocking in at two and a half hours, 
this council meeting was the longest I’ve 
attended so far. Council got rowdy for a 
while and many members entertained 
themselves with side conversations 
during presentations and arguments. 
Ben Hassine echoed my thoughts when 
she scolded council for disrespecting 
the speakers. For one presentation, she 
forced everyone to shut their laptops.

understand that Dean Edley’s future is 
going to be significantly threatened if 
the UC Regents don’t follow through 
with their promise to greatly increase 
his compensation,” Johnson said.

Edley has served as dean and 
professor of law for UC Berkeley’s Boalt 
Hall School of Law for seven years, and 
taught at Harvard Law for 23 years 
prior. 

Edley and the law school could not 
be reached for comment.

revenue, which could come from 
accepting more non-residents as well 
as philanthropy, increased contract and 
grant awards and new partnerships. 

“Our future depends on the strength 
of new research partnerships,” Fox said.

The meeting then started with the 
Committee on Educational Policy, 
which discussed a new admissions 
process for undergraduate applications. 

The committee endorsed the 
resolution for a individualized 
holistic review, which would examine 
achievements within the context of 
opportunities available to the student.

“These [applicants] know, besides 
doing well on SATs [and] grade point 
average, they need to do community 
service,” Regent Richard C. Blum said. 
“They also know that they need to be 
good citizen[s] on campus.”

Cheng supported the decision.
“The admissions decision is a really 

great thing that happened, because it’s 
something I’ve been fighting for since I 
was a first year,” Cheng said. 

Vice President of Budget Patrick 
Lenz gave a presentation on the 
funding alternatives for Brown’s 
recommendations.

Fox said the effects of impending 
cuts will put a strain on UCSD.

“We put additional pressure on 
affordability,” Fox said. “We won’t be 
able to attract grad students or afford 
retention packages.”

UCSA President Claudia Magaña 
said the fee increases have always been 
in direct conflict with the California 
Master Plan for Higher Education.

“You are exhausting this funding 
source too severely, too quickly,” 
Magaña said to the regents. 

Meetings ended with closed 
and regents-only sessions to discuss 
compensation and finance. 

The last time the regents met in San 
Diego was January 2006.

“We generally have only one or two 
meetings a year on campuses other than 
UCSF because it is more cost effective 
to have them in San Francisco,” UCOP 
spokesperson Steve Montiel said in 
an e-mail. “It is important, however, 
to hold the meetings at different UC 
campuses so that students and faculty 
can participate directly in the meetings.”

UCOP Vice President for 
Communications Lynn Tierney praised 
UCSD’s campus.

“We also came because it was the 
50th anniversary and it’s gorgeous.”

At yesterday’s meeting, the UC 
Regents discussed the UC Sustainability 
report in addition to capital 
improvements at other campuses. 

At the last meeting tomorrow, the 
regents will vote on compensation for 
UC Merced’s Interim Vice Chancellor, 
in addition to several laboratory 
directors, who will receive at least 
a 1.8-percent increase in their base 
salaries, which are $274,008 and above. 
The salary increases will be funded by 
the U.S. Department of Energy.

During the Thursday meeting, 
representatives from the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Local 3299 union 
will demonstrate outside to denounce 
the $2.1 million executive perks. 

“We’re protesting the regents giving 
more bonuses  to executives at the same 
time [as] increasing fees for students 
and attacking workers’ retirement,” 
AFSCME Local 3299 Lead Organizer 
Matias Marin said. 

Marin said they will be giving a 
performance as part of their protest.

“We’re going to do something we 
haven’t really done before,” Marin said. 
“We’re [going to do] street theater to 
explain what’s going on as the United 
Farm Workers did in their day.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/OPINIONTHURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 2011

Like most college students, I don’t exactly get a high from doing laundry, organizing my 
closet or doing the dishes. Growing 
up, my parents would give me the 
typical “clean your room or else” 
ultimatums, but to no avail, and so, 
when I applied for housing fresh-
man year, a single seemed like the 
only option that wouldn’t result in a 
“freshman murdered by roommates 
over messy room” news headline. 

Sometimes I like to fool myself 
into thinking that I have such an 
exciting and action-packed life that 
I don’t have time to clean my room 
— but let’s be honest: I don’t.

And while I think it’s perfectly 
OK to have all my clothes on the 
biggest shelf in the apartment (the 
floor), some members of the rest 
of the world (the civilized ones) 
apparently doesn’t share that same 
sentiment.  Typically, my room goes 
through a six-step cycle: 

1. All of my clothes are hung 
up and organized by color, sleeve 
length and fabric, thanks to my 
miserable summer at Forever 21. 

2. One by one, every item of 
clothing goes from my closet to my 
floor.

3. Laundry.
4. Instead of hanging the clean 

clothes up, I dump them back onto 
the floor to be picked through over 
the next few weeks before repeating 
step three.

5. Should someone come over, 
everything gets shoved in my closet 
and under the bed — then repeat 
steps two through four.

6. With the exception of step 
one: rinse, wash and repeat. 

For the past 19 years or so, 
despite glares from my mother, 
looks from friends and the “Is that 
thing growing?” every so often, this 
system has worked out just fine. 

It wasn’t until I realized that 
the random scrap of paper I threw 
out was actually my $400 speeding 
ticket that it occurred to me that 
this “lifestyle” wasn’t as sustainable 
as I thought. 

Unlike building up running 
endurance, going from slob to spot-
less was something I had to do cold 
turkey. 

That weekend, my friend was 
flying down from Davis, so I fig-
ured it was a good a time as any to 
whip out the pesticides. (In case 
you’re wondering, that “thing” isn’t 
growing anymore.) 

Glimpsing the piles of old essays, 
food my bird threw out of her 
cage, disposed wrappers of vary-
ing degrees of incrimination and a 
Styrofoam box that I think might

Plus, even though Jillian

major caveat is having a dirty room.

Another year, another record. Last Friday, the UC Office of the President 
announced that this year’s applica-
tion rates are the highest ever — 
again. For the seventh consecutive 
year, more students than ever are 
seeking admission at UC campuses, 
and UCSD’s 11.2-percent applicant 
increase from 2010 is second only 
to perennial favorite UCLA. 

But the news isn’t good for a 
university system — already well 
over $20 billion in debt — that was 
just hit with Gov. Jerry Brown’s pro-
posed $500-million funding cut. 

Last week, the Guardian 
reported that for the first time in 
university history, students next 
year will pay more into the UC 
operating budget than will the 
state. Coupled with the near-certain 
prospect of another enrollment cut 
(the last occurred for the 2009-2010 
academic year, with a reduction of 
2,300 students across the system), 
these changes represent a momen-
tous step back from the California 
Master Plan for Higher Education 
which, when signed into law in 
1960, touted accessibility among its 
chief goals for the UC. 

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae 
Brown, the increase in applications 
and decrease in funding means that 
UCSD will be forced to  reduce 
enrollment for California students. 
This sets campuses further on the 
path of privatization, a path that 
again violates the original UC 
Master Plan.

Of course, there could be a faint 
silver lining for those of us left:  A 

lowered rate of admission may help 
boost UCSD in national rankings, 
especially those of the U.S. News 
and World Report, which weighs 
exclusivity heavily, alongside other 
factors like student-to-teacher ratios 
and graduation rates.

Hopefully, once current students 
enter the job market, they may be 
able to credit the state budget crisis 
for a degree that, if earned through 
larger, more restricted courses, is at 
least more exclusive. Excellent.

A more commendable aspect of 
the UCOP announcement concerns 
minority applicants, with the num-
ber of Chicano/Latino and African-
American applicants up from last 
year. 

The increases suggest that 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s and 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue’s efforts at saving face 
following the Winter Quarter 2010 
Compton Cookout fiasco may have 
actually had some tangible impact. 
(Or perhaps just that applicants 
didn’t take as much notice as Fox 
and Rue were afraid they might.)

But these achievements pale in 
comparison to what is being lost. 

Fifty years on, the university has 
never been further from the master 
plan’s goals. While the Office of 
the President is likely cheering last 
Friday’s announcement as affirma-
tion of continued student interest 
in the UC system, this board firmly 
believes that its efforts must be 
focused on lobbying state legislators 
to reprioritize higher education. 
Because with rising fees and dwin-
dling resources, interest in a failing 
system won’t last forever.  

I t’s been over a month since for-mer linguistics lecturer Henry Acejo was tragically murdered, 
and UCSD has yet to say or do any-
thing about the matter.

Although Acejo wasn’t an 
internationally known figure like 
other faculty members — such as 
political science professor Chalmers 
Johnson, who passed away last 
November — Acejo deserves the 
acknowledgement for his contribu-
tions as a Filipino language and cul-
ture lecturer, either in the form of a 
statement, on-campus memorial or 

commemoration.
According to UCSD spokes-

person Christine Clark statements 
regarding deaths are only for chan-
cellors or administrative faculty that 
have died. This protocol overlooks 
all the other UCSD community 
members whose deaths are equally 
worth commemorating. 

While Acejo may have only 
been employed by UCSD since 
2006, it never hurts to commemo-
rate the life and achievements 
of anyone who helped build the 
university. Acejo was an important 

part of the San Diego commu-
nity, teaching  ESL and Tagalog 
classes not only at UCSD, but 
also at San Diego State University, 
Southwestern College and Mid-
City College.

UCSD claims to provide “swift, 
caring and professional assistance” 
to the families of students who have 
died. Acejo deserves no less.

Acejo’s passing has already 
received national and international 
news coverage. His death has been 
acknowledged — in the form of 
statements, memorials, Facebook 

groups and donations for funeral 
expenses — by all the San Diego 
institutions of higher education he 
has worked at, save UCSD.

Sending out a mass e-mail to 
express condolences is a simple 
effort that honors Acejo’s memory 
and expresses a thought — that he 
was valued, that he was appreciated 
— that his family and friends deeply 
need to hear. 

And for a faculty member whose 
love for teaching inspired hundreds 
of students, it would be effort well-
spent.

laptop there to do my WebCT read-
ing any time soon.

To make things easier, I decided 
to divide my room 
into sections: desk, 
floor, closet, garbage. 

First stop, my 
desk. With a swipe of 
my hand, old essay 
drafts and empty 
water bottles were 
swept off my desk 
and into the recy-
cling. Done.

The rest of my 
room wasn’t quite as 
easy. I hadn’t made my bed since 
the beginning of Fall Quarter and 
after I cleared it of clothes that 

desperately needed to be washed, I 
went to work tucking and folding.

After breaking a sweat, I figured 
that it would be easier to just wash 

all of the 
clothes on 
the floor 
rather than 
trying to 
figure out 
which ones 
were clean 
and which 
needed to be 
sanitized.

Slowly 
but surely, 

my room went from being Korea’s 
DMZ to something that might even 
win Martha Stewart’s seal of approv-

al. Now, for the hard part: maintain-
ing that level of cleanliness. 

That night, as I threw my jeans 
on the floor, I stopped and told 
myself, “No! Pick it up.” 

Miraculously, I did. Over the 
next few days, as I tried to break 19 
years of bad habits, it was a constant 
schizophrenic battle with myself. 

“Pick it up!”
“I can do it later.”
“No! Drop and give me 50, 

Hori!”
Eventually, the military sergeant 

in me prevailed, and aside from a 
few slip-ups here and there, for two 
whole weeks I’ve been able to keep 
my room a near-socially-acceptable 
clean. (Unless you count those 
wrappers. I sure don’t.)

Dear Editor, 
As a Harvard graduate and an 

advocate of Harvard ROTC, I was 
greatly disturbed by both the mis-
understandings and falsehoods 
advanced in the Guardian’s Jan. 10 
article “This Unit’s Out of Line,” 
which highlighted various Ivy League 
schools and Stanford’s efforts to rein-
state ROTC. 
       First, inaccurately, Allison Gauss 
states that the main concern about 
ROTC is its failure in meeting uni-
versity academic standards and that 
elite schools broke off ROTC ties 
because of its inadequate preparation 
of graduates. 

This is wrong on multiple counts. 
First, both ROTC supporters and 
opponents would agree that anti-
militarism and faculty opposition 
to Vietnam were the main causes 
of ROTC removal on most college 
campuses. Today, most opposition 
to ROTC is driven by opposition to 
the recently repealed discriminatory 
DADT policy. 
     Secondly, the argument that 
ROTC should not be denied recogni-
tion due to low standards is absurd. 
Gauss does not even have the facts 
right — there is no requirement in 
the law that colleges have to grant 
credit for ROTC coursework; colleges 
can set their standards. 

For example, Princeton does not 
count ROTC courses for credit and 
at MIT, where Harvard ROTC now 
proudly trains, a number of courses 
have been designed to be rigorous 
and taught by regular Harvard faculty, 
such as Henry Kissinger and Stephen 

Rosen. At Columbia, similar efforts 
have been made to count courses 
like military history, international 
relations and game theory, creating a 
rigorous curriculum. 
     If colleges truly believe in advanc-
ing truth and knowledge, we need 
to embrace the open forum of ideas, 
including those offered by our 
ROTC peers. To shut off debate and 
permanently remove the welcome 
mat is detrimental to the interests of 
all students and, at the same time, 
the academic community misses an 
opportunity to press its ideas and 
share important insights. 
     It is high time that ROTC students 
from Harvard and other colleges get 
the recognition they deserve. 

Despite serving their communi-
ties and our nation with honor, my 
ROTC classmates not only received 
no official recognition and credit, but 
had to travel an hour a day to train, 
were prohibited from using univer-
sity facilities and faced a variety of 
other college-imposed administrative 
hurdles. America’s bravest deserve 
our support on America’s college 
campuses. 
     The time for partisan activism and 
campus politicking is over — 
reinstate ROTC now!

I mentally barfed at the idea of live theater when I was eight. Back then, I was tomboyish and, as a Girl Scout 
with a vest full of badges, I wasn’t all that 
enthused when we trooped off to a local 
production of “Charlotte’s Web.” For the 
sake of E.B. White and the actress with 
papier-mâché spider legs dangling from 
her hips, I wished the curtain would 
drop a few scenes early. 

Since then, the mystique of drama has 
transformed me into a regular theatergoer. 
Like many other bio majors and pre-meds 
at UCSD, I have a covert appreciation for 
the performing arts. Why the combina-
tion of these two incompatible interests 
is so common, I can’t exactly explain. 
Perhaps the right lobe of my brain isn’t 
any bigger than the left, but I’m convinced 
there’s a quality  about the theater that 
keeps us scientifically inclined folk as 
hooked to the stage as we are to MCAT 
preparation and the Lehninger textbook.

The load of a pre-med can be over-
whelming, to be sure, so it’s only logical 
that we derive some catharsis from the 
theater. The need for escape would, at the 
very least, explain why I was so hell-bent 
on getting the role of Dorothy in a sixth-
grade production of “The Wizard of Oz.” 

After a weekend of observing Judy 
Garland, I scuffled on stage to audition. 
I was in the middle of the song’s second 
verse when the piano accompaniment 
abruptly stopped and I heard that fore-
boding knell: “Thank you.” So much for 
the dreams that you dare to dream really 
coming true. Nevertheless, I still audi-
tioned for the Lullaby League and Auntie 
Em, the role I eventually played. 

Bottom line: I refused to be a 
Munchkin in the ensemble. Call me 
out for not being a team player, but my 
point here is that this vicarious way of 
living — on stage or off — is what makes 
theater such a fascinating art. I may not 
have been dolled up in a checkered blue 
jumper and sparkling ruby slippers, but 
counting eggs on a Kansas farm was 
about as down and dirty a tomboy in the 
Bay Area could get.  

The immediacy of theater also lends 
itself to an experience that even film can’t 
rival. I like to ask people whether they’d 
rather watch a brilliant film or play. Film 
has its own merits, namely the ability to 
completely envelop and transport you 
to another world (like James Cameron’s 
Pandora or George Lucas’s galaxy far, far 
away). It’s only in theater, though, that 
wigs fall off, bungee cords snap and  actors 
fumble through lines. The spontaneity 
mimics real life and provides a conduit 
through which an audience can readily 
posit themselves in the story of the play.  

Scientists, though, aren’t the only 
unexpected patrons of theater. While 
the evolution of the Internet in recent 
decades has rendered newspapers an 
endangered species, theater has been 
able to fend off the rising threat of CGI 
and the green screen. If anything, tech-
nology has revived the performing arts. 
Spiderman can now sling across the 
Broadway stage with the limberness of 
Tobey Maguire, and even the most clos-
eted of drama geeks can’t help but bust a 
move to the auto-tuned tracks of “Glee.”

I never again sat through my VHS 
copy of “The Wizard of Oz” (though, 
many shower sessions later, I’m happy 
to report that I can get past the second 
verse). I’m as content — if not more con-
tent — in the anonymity of the audience 
as I would be on stage, however hard it 
may be to explain why.

CONCERTPREVIEW

Teen rockers Dirty Gold 
are heating up the local 
music scene . . . and still 
turning their homework 
in on time. 
By Kelly Hill • Staff Writer

Beach      
   Boys

P
icture this: a group of teenage boys inches into the Pacific, surf-
ers paddle out from shore, beach babes sunbathe on the sand.  
All the images are cut together with faux-vintage saturation. 
Vampire Weekend-style Afrobeat drums complement loose, 

effervescent guitar lines, while a soulful singer declares his adoration 
for the Golden State: “I’ve been sleeping far too long, hibernating from 
your love / I need some summer sun to come and wake me up,” he 
croons. 

This music video — as well as the song itself, “California Sunrise” 
— has been making waves on the Internet since it was first posted 
back in October, garnering tens of thousands of views on YouTube and 
Vimeo. 

It might come as a surprise, then, to learn that it’s the first single 
from a couple of local high school kids. 

Carlsbad’s Dirty Gold  —a trio composed of brothers John (vocals/
guitar) and Lincoln (keyboard) Ballif and friend Jeff Nassif (drums) 
— have received more acclaim in the local music scene in the last few 
months than most bands who have been together for years. They’ve 
found play on 91X’s Locals Only show and made it on to DJ Mat 
Diablo’s Best of 2010 list, alongside artists like Crystal Castles, School of 
Seven Bells and Yeasayer, and are playing at the Casbah tonight. Not so 
bad for three high schoolers, two of whom can’t even buy cigarettes yet.   

John, 18, is the oldest, Jeff is 17 and Lincoln, 16, is the baby of the 
group. They’ve already played shows at The Tin Can Ale House and 
Che Cafe.

The Guardian met up with Dirty Gold at an Encinitas Chipotle 
(they wanted burritos), where they opened up about their quick rise in 
the San Diego music scene.

INTERVIEW
G: What do you think about break-
ing out in the music scene so sud-
denly? 
Lincoln Ballif: I didn’t even think 
it was going to happen at all. I just 
kind of started writing music over 
the summer and I had no plans for 
it to go anywhere. Then John took 
an interest in it, put it on some blogs 
and then it kind of started getting big 
from there. So everything that’s hap-
pened has kind of been a surprise, 
like a shock almost. 
Jeff Nassif: Right now our e-mail is 
like an IM chat.  
G: You had UK video artist 
Panaframe involved with the video 
for “California Sunrise.” How did 
that come about?  
L. Ballif: Basically we just got a 
Myspace message one day early, early 
on — maybe like a week or two after 
putting it on the Internet — and this 
guy was just like, “Hey, can we make 
a music video?” We were like, “Uhhh 
… you can make an unofficial music 
video, not like a real music video.” So 
he said, “What do you want on it?” 
We said, “Something we can project 
live behind us while we play.” And 
he made it and we were just waiting 
for a response, and a week later I 

just typed in “’Dirty Gold ‘California 
Sunrise’” [on Google] and this video 
popped up.
G: Are you planning on doing an 
official music video anytime soon? 
L. Ballif: Probably. We’ve gotten 
some offers from just some random 
videographers and directors. So I 
think once we release the EP we can 
do that. But we haven’t made it quite 
through yet. 
G: Do you think Panaframe’s 
involvement made more buzz for 
“California Sunrise”? 
Jeff Nassif: Oh, definitely.
L. Ballif: Over 60,000 views don’t 
hurt.
John Ballif: And I think when 
people can associate the visual aes-
thetic of our sound with the song, it 
kind of clicks for a lot of people and 
they can be like, “Oh, I really like this 
song and I really like this band.” But 
that was pretty cool.
G: You guys are playing at the 
Casbah this week. How do you 
guys feel about playing a 21-and-up 
venue? 
J. Nassif: Yeah, we’ve done it before. 
But Casbah’s obviously, like, a huge

High Schoolers Talk Debut EP and Rocking Out for Their History Teachers
venue, so we’re kind of stoked about 
that. And it’s kind of cool: Thursday, 
school night, going out playing a show.
L. Ballif: All our teachers are coming, 
actually. 
G: So are you guys going to try and 
slip some beers while you’re there?
J. Nassif: Nah.
J. Ballif: We don’t really care.
G: Well, you guys [John and Lincoln] 
are Mormon.
J. Nassif: I wouldn’t do it anyway.
J. Ballif: It’s really not a big deal for us. 
I think it’s funny when people go out 
to the bar.
J. Nassif: We really want to just hang 
around and see the other bands too. 
We’re really stoked. 
G: Who else are you playing with at 
Casbah? 
J. Ballif: TV Girl and. . . 
J. Nassif: LeSands and Jamuel Saxon. 
G: Do you guys know what you’re 
going to play? 
J. Ballif: We’re just playing pretty 
much everything on our new EP that’s 
coming out soon, and then a song 
that’s not gonna be on= the EP that we 
just wrote together.
J. Nassif: Well, somewhat. They had 
already written it, but we put it togeth-
er like an hour ago.  
G: Oh, nice. So is it along the same 
lines as your other songs? 
J. Ballif: A little bit. It’s along a little 
more of the rocky side than some of 
our other stuff, so that’s cool.
G: You guys are under an LA-based 
label, Autumn Tone Records. Are you 
recording here in San Diego or are you 
going up there to record? 

J. Nassif: We’re recording at my house, 
just with some friends that I’ve known 
since middle school. They know Logic 
and all the recording software, so 
they’ve been helping us out. 
G: How do your parents feel about you 
playing music? 
J. Ballif: Our parents are super sup-
portive.  I mean, they’re new to the 
whole scene and so when we want to 
play 21-and-up venues they’re kind of 
skeptical of it, but they’ve let us choose 
for ourselves and so that’s been really 
cool. And they’ve been super support-
ive of just, like, how much we’ve had to 
practice and record, and stuff like that.
G: Are they trying to push you still 
with all of your schoolwork?
J. Ballif: We push each other. I mean, 
we’re good students anyway.
J. Nassif: Every time we’re talking 
about band stuff I’ll be like, “Hey, you 
guys done your science homework?” 
We always make sure we do all of it 
because we know if anything slips, the 
band’s the first thing to go. 
G: So are you guys in the same class? 
J. Nassif: [John] and I are. [Lincoln’s] a 
grade younger.
L. Ballif: I’m in a couple of their 
classes.
J. Nassif: And I took some of the 
classes that Lincoln took last year, and 
classes that I took last year he’s taking 
this year, so it kind of works out. We 
have to go home and do homework 
tonight actually.
G: So Lincoln and John — you’re 
brothers. Is there one of you that’s 
more of the dominant force in the 
band? 
J. Ballif: I’m the singer, I guess. But 
there’s a song that we’re playing on 

Thursday that [Lincoln] sings. It’s kind 
of been a struggle just trying to figure 
out who’s going to do what. I mean, we 
play the same instruments, except that 
I play bass. And so it’s just kind of hard 
to figure out. But I think we’ve been 
really understanding.
J. Nassif: It was rough in the begin-
ning but…it’s a lot better now. 
G: Did you have to act as mediator? 
J. Nassif: [laughing] Yeah, somewhat. 
I would just be here sitting on my 
drum stool watching it happen. But it’s 
worked out. 
G: What do you think makes your 
sound so captivating? 
J. Ballif: Most of our songs have kind 
of a hook that draw people in and it’s 
really accessible to a lot of different 
listeners.  But it has a really unique 
sound that people haven’t heard before.
J. Nassif: And I think with “California 
Sunrise”…I dunno, it’s like…It some-
times makes you happy? I think it kind 
of makes you want to be happy too.
L. Ballif: I think we write all of our 
stuff so that we like it, so it’s really 
selfish in that way and it just works 
out. It’s not like we’re writing for, you 
know, anyone in particular. If we like it 
then, well, then we hope other people 
are going to like it and I think that’s 
the key.
G: Are you planning on touring dur-
ing summer? 
J. Ballif: We want to tour. And maybe 
put out a full-length album.  
G: Have you talked to your label about 
touring? 
J. Nassif: We’re just kind of getting by 
right now.
J. Ballif: We just kind of signed up for 
this release of the EP which is com-

ing out tomorrow, but we’re not really 
thinking about touring and stuff with 
them. But we’re going to South by 
Southwest and so we’re going to be 
talking to, I’m sure, managers and stuff 
there. 
G: Who are you guys excited about 
seeing at SXSW? 
L. Ballif: Tennis, for sure, Small Black.
J. Nassif: Yeah, I’m excited to see some 
house DJs like Skrillex and stuff like 
that. I think it’ll be a blast. 
J. Nassif: It’s cool, South by Southwest 
has so many different genres and types 
of music there, and you can kind of 
see whatever you want. But we’re really 
excited for that, because who doesn’t 
like missing two, three days of school 
and seeing bands?
G: Are your teachers going to be OK 
with that? 

J. Nassif: We haven’t really told them 
yet.
J. Ballif: If not, sucks for them!
J. Nassif: No, we’ll figure it out. We’ll 
do our homework.
L. Ballif: Our teachers have been really 
supportive. Like, they’ve come to all of 
our shows.
J. Nassif: Yeah, all of our teachers were 
at our first show, so it’s cool. 
G: What sorts of things can we expect 
on your EP, or what are you planning 
for your album? 
J. Ballif: Definitely diversity.
J. Nassif: There’s different tempos, 
there’s different styles, different feels.
L. Ballif: I’d definitely say, expect an 
introduction. That’s kind of what we 
said as the opening to our band. So 
that’s what we’re coming with: the first 
chapter of a book.  

▶ DIRTY fromÊpageÊ7

M ike Ness of Social Distortion — the Fullerton punk band’s only remaining original member 
— has spent the last 30 years raging 
against the powers that be. Now the 
dude’s 48, you might think he and his 
band are too old for the mosh pit, but 
with their seventh album, Hard Times 
and Nursery Rhymes, Social D offers 
an updated take on the band’s trade-
mark blues-punk style. 

Social Distortion songs have always 
been biographical; Ness’s angsty lyr-
ics reflect upon past battles with 
heroin addiction and the struggles of 
living on the streets of Hollywood. 
“From the back to the front page /
From the gutter to the stage,” he says 
of Social D’s legacy on album closer 
“Still Alive.” The track’s a brazen 
middle finger to anyone who thought 
Ness and his band were finished. 
Accompanied by punk guitar and soft 
piano, his vocals are at their gruff, 

emotional finest.
But Ness isn’t afraid to experiment 

lyrically, playing someone other than 
himself  — a Bonnie and Clyde-style 
gangster on “Machine Gun Blues.” 
Though the lyrics are pretty straight-
forward (“I left your town, took all 
your loot / Bought a pink carnation 
and a pinstripe suit”), upbeat, harmo-
nious rhythms — not to mention all 
the fun Ness has playing a badass — 
compensate for any lackluster rhymes. 

Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes 
is more polished than the band’s 
previous works (probably due to the 
amount of time spent in the studio — 
work on the album began in 2005). 
But while there isn’t a lot of mosh-pit 
material on Hard Times, Ness proves 
that  even with teenage kids and 
grown-ass problems, Social Distortion 
haven’t lost all their edge.

‘Mine Smell Like Honey’
R.E.M.
WARNER BROS.

T he combination of Michael Stipe’s gruff, wordy vocals and Peter Buck’s clanging, reverb-heavy guitar practically served as the soundtrack for an era of post-college couch-hopping and political debate. But that era was almost two decades ago. And 
now, after a few unremarkable albums and a couple more regrettable ones, R.E.M. are 
back with the first single from this year’s upcoming Collapse Into Now. 

“Mine Smell Like Honey” is pleasant enough. A cheery, ’90s alt-rock riff kicks off the 
track, but is promptly blunted by a clumsy verse that beats the honey imagery to death: 
“Mine smell like honey, uh! / Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- honey, uh!” An uplifting cho-
rus spares the track from total mediocrity (when Stipe isn’t urging us to “track a trail of 
honey through it all”), but does little to kickstart the legendary band’s fading relevance.

W hether it’s four dap-per Columbia grads, a bearded loner in 
a Wisconsin cabin or the 
grown-up product of a cult, 
indie rock has always loved a 
weird backstory. And Denver 
husband-wife duo Tennis 
more than fit the bill. 

Patrick Riley and Alaina 
Moore met in college, got 
married and spent seven 
months or so sailing along the 
Eastern seaboard together. 
With no way to play music at 
sea, they started writing songs 
to soundtrack their voyage. 
Once back on solid ground, 
they collected these songs as 
their debut LP.

It’s almost too cute to 
be true, and we wouldn’t be 
surprised if Riley and Moore’s 
story served as a cover-up for 
mediocre music. But on Cape 
Dory, Tennis blows those 
suspicions out of the water, 
treating the listener to 10 
tracks of breezy, well-crafted 
pop music.

While some of their 
peers look to hazy ’70s folk 
(Woods, Real Estate) or 
fuzzed-out psych rock (Ty 
Segall, the Soft Pack) for 
inspiration, Tennis tend more 
toward ’60s pop. “Marathon,” 
the album’s best track, bears 
a striking resemblance to 

early Serge Gainsbourg, while 
“Pigeon,” another standout, 
comes off as a cross between 
the Walkmen and Dusty 
Springfield. 

Though many of the 
songs here are, predictably,  
about sailing (titles include 
“Bimini Bay” and “Long Boat 
Pass”), the lyrics are more 
concerned with love, specifi-
cally the unique bond formed 
between two people during 
extended periods of isolation. 
Moore peppers her lyrics 
with statements like “Coconut 
Grove is a very small cove 
/ Separated from the sea by 
a shifting shoal,” but she’s 
more convincing when she’s 
serenading her lover (“I’ll be 
holding you tight / Let you 
sleep through the night / Let 
the wind blow / We will be 
safe, I know”). 

Critics have expressed 
concern that, now hav-
ing depleted their stock of 
cutesy sailing stories, the pair 
might run out of material. 
But despite the topicality of 
their work (hey, they’re still 
on a boat), Riley and Moore 
prove on Cape Dory that they 
haven’t lost steam just yet.

Husband-and-Wife Duo Craft 
Sunny Indie-Pop on the Open Seas

W ith the Decemberists’ 2009 release The Hazards of Love, 
frontman Colin Meloy got 
grandiosely geeky, crafting 
a rock opera with a pecu-
liar narrative: A woman 
declares a shape-shifter 
her one true love, dodges 
the fury of a jealous fairy 
queen and gets abducted by 
a villain known only as “the 
rake.” Throw in some mor-
bid bits on child murder 
and the record begins to 
toe the line between ambi-
tion and absurdity. 

Thankfully, on the 
album’s follow-up, The King 
Is Dead, Meloy and the rest 
of the Portland-based gang 
break down the bravado 
and start anew, reveling in 
the simplicity of American 
folk.

Nearly all of the songs 
are kept under the five-
minute mark, and there 
are no great tales spanning 
multiple tracks. In other 
words, it’s sort of like the 
Decemberists for Dummies: 
The album compresses 
Meloy’s knack for verbose 
storytelling with the band’s 
typical eccentric instru-
ments (pedal steel, accordi-
on, bouzouki) in a clearer, 
more listenable fashion.

First single “Down by 
The Water” fits the formula 
to a T: A catchy chorus 
(featuring the vocals of 
bluegrass singer Gillian 
Welch) backs uplifting 
harmonicas, airy acoustic 
guitars and tambourine 
shakes, as Meloy tells of “an 
ancient riverbed … where 
all our follies are led.”

“Dear Avery” is remi-
niscent of an old-school 
country love song — a 
departure from the band’s 
Anglo-folk roots — incor-
porating the genre’s slide 
guitars, feisty fiddles and 
swaying melodies. Meloy’s 
lyrics may have you reach-
ing for your dictionary 
at times, but with such 
tranquil melodies, you’ll be 
quick to forgive. 

With The King Is Dead, 
the Decemberists are alive 
and rejuvenated, though 
lacking some of the liter-
ary weight that the band 
is notorious for. But with 
these more compact ver-
sions of the epic Hazards 
Of Love ballads, the 
Decemberists finally have 
a new story worth singing 
along to.

O n their 2009 self-titled debut, Smith Westerns embodied the lo-fi 
beach party scene that has 
come to include bands like 
Best Coast and Wavves. On 
tour, they cursed and spat 
through a grungy, distorted 
set, drank through the night 
and got themselves kicked 
out of the Music Hall of 
Williamsburg for “pissing in 
garbage cans.”

On their second album, 
Dye It Blonde, the Chicago 
teenagers have grown up a 
little, ditching their base-
ment roots for glossier 
production and channeling 
the legendary glam rock of 
T. Rex and David Bowie. 
With sweeping, anthemic 
arrangements and wailing 
guitar solos, Smith Westerns 
manage to shed their bratty, 
amateurish punk tenden-
cies while still holding on to 
their adolescent charm. 

“Weekend” opens the 
album with an endlessly 
catchy hook, sandwiched by 
the aloof vocals of greasy-
haired frontman Cullen 
Omori. “Weekends are 
never fun / Unless you’re 
around here too,” he whines. 

From here, the album 
drifts from pool-party 
love songs to campy, ’70s 

throwbacks, with tracks 
driven by soaring lead 
guitars and lovesick lyr-
ics. The rollicking “Dance 
Away” collapses into a sud-
denly majestic, cut-time 
refrain before grooving 
into an upbeat sing-along 
— harkening back to fellow 
Midwesterners and power-
pop legends Cheap Trick.

Meanwhile, “Imagine, 
Pt. 3” drives from blissful 
chorus to blissful chorus, 
culminating in a stadium-
worthy breakdown loaded 
with the melodic pop sensi-
bility that defined a golden 
age of rock ‘n’ roll. 

Not that Dye It Blonde 
is totally devoid of teenage 
carnage. On the massive, 
Beatles-style ballad “All 
Die Young,” Omori wails, 
“I wanna grow old before I 
grow up / I wanna die with 
my chin up” over a choir of 
swirling organ and childlike 
back-up vocals. 

And who could blame 
them? The party’s going 
all night long, and Smith 
Westerns aren’t planning 
on stopping. With such 
a promising sophomore 
release, neither are we.

NOLAN THOMAS/GUARDIAN

immense talent and latent ability. They are at the top of the 
most-played and most-watched sport in the U.S. because 
they work their butts off every single day. For 
this reason, they are good captains and good 
leaders that their teams are willing to follow 
into anything.

Skill certainly has a part in who should 
lead; just as someone is not going to follow a 
lazy player, he will not follow a horrible player 
just because he works hard. The best leaders 
are those who work hard and have a modicum 
of talent. But the best player on the team does 
not always make the best leader. 

The best leader is often the one with the 
most experience and most work ethic. The 
one thing I always tell anyone who asks why 
I am successful in my sport is, “I may not be 
the best, but I am the one who is working the 
hardest and smartest to be the best.” In my 
case, it turned into a national championship. 

Leaders and captains should be heard, but a voice to 
drown out all others is not necessary to every situation. One 
of the best coaches I know, head women’s track coach Darcy 

Ahner, can barely be heard from 35 feet away, even when 
she yells. But she is so knowledgeable and experienced that, 
even with her small voice, people respect and follow what 

she is saying. When she speaks, people stop talking 
and listen. 

That is the key to being a good leader on the 
field, even if you are a quiet person. When you 
speak, you need to know what you are talking 
about and be inspiring. That being said, there are 
times when cussing and yelling at your team might 
be a good idea, but most of the time quiet, precise 
leadership is the best way to harness the abilities of 
a team. 

A good leader can take a team higher than they 
think they could go themselves, and can make a 
team better than it actually is. But to do this, he 
needs to be the first one in and the last to leave. He 
needs to want it more than anyone else; to know 
when to yell and when to be silent, and when to 
cheer and when to commiserate. You can be a 
leader in anything if you transfer these same char-

acteristics to any part of life; it just takes a little backbone 
and some hard work, combined with a little know how to be 
a respected leader in your field. 

The Triton men also had a 
solid weekend, securing a double-
overtime victory over Cal State LA 
before a tough loss to No. 7 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 

Junior Center Christian Hatch had 
a game-high 26 points and 13 boards 
against CSULA, but was held to just 6 
points against Dominguez Hills. The 
Tritons will need to find a way to get 
him involved in the offense again, as 
he averages a team-best 14.6 points per 
game. 

UCSD’s offense as a whole has sput-
tered, shooting less than 40 percent 

from the field in each of the last five 
games. The Tritons have supplemented 
this with good defense and rebound-
ing, and senior guard Casey Ryan 
— all 6’4” of him — is the current con-
ference leader in rebounding with 9.8 
rebounds per game.

San Bernardino currently sits in 
fourth place in the CCAA, with a 
6-3 conference record and 8-5 over-
all record. UCSD has not beaten the 
Coyotes since 2008. 

The Tritons will then face defend-
ing national champions Cal Poly 
Pomona, who has had a rough season 
at 7-6 overall and 4-5 in conference 

play. The Broncos have the players that 
average double figures in scoring, led 
by Dwayne Fells’ average of 13.5 points 
a game.

UCSD comes into the week 9-7 
overall and 4-6 in the CCAA.

The Tritons face San Bernardino 
on Thursday, Jan. 19, then host Cal 
Poly Pomona on Saturday, Jan. 21. The 
women’s game tips off at 5:30 p.m. 
followed by the men’s game at 7:30 
p.m. on Thursday and Saturday, all at 
RIMAC Arena.

By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

BASKETBALL — The UCSD men’s and women’s bas-
ketball teams will look to continue their recent good 
form as they host Cal State San Bernardino and Cal 
Poly Pomona this week. 

The Triton women are on a six-game winning 
streak following victories over Cal State LA and Cal 
State Dominguez Hills last weekend. Sophomore guard 
Emily Osga had a pair of outstanding games, averaging 
a team-high 19.5 points and 7.5 rebounds on 65-per-
cent shooting. The sophomore also went 9-12 from 

beyond the arc.
This weekend figures to be a tougher test for the 

Tritons as they face two of the top four teams in 
the conference. San Bernardino sits in fourth in the 
CCAA, and is 11-2 and 7-2 in conference. The Coyotes 
are second in the conference in team defense — allow-
ing just 52.5 points per game — and will try to slow 
down the Tritons best-in-conference offense that puts 
up more than 77 points a game.  

Cal Poly Pomona is second in the CCAA, with an 
8-1 conference record and 11-2 overall. The Broncos’ 
only loss is to undefeated Cal State Monterey Bay, and 
Pomona is outscoring opponents by an average of 15.4 
points per game. The Tritons will have to find a way to 
slow down the CCAA’s leading scorer Reyana Colson, 
who averages 20.5 points per game.

UCSD is currently 10-7 overall and 8-2 in confer-
ence play.

I would like to think I’m a good 
leader, having played and excelled 
at sports since I was four years 
old in Little League. I have been a 
team captain, All-American and a 
national champion. 

But I’ve also been down to 
points where I couldn’t get much 
lower on the totem pole. Bad habits 
in my swing meant that I batted 
low in the lineup when I started 
high school baseball. I was behind 
two seniors in competing for a 
starting position at the beginning 
of my junior year in basketball.

All of this points to what I view 
in my life has been the defining 
characteristic of my success in ath-
letics, and what I believe is the key 
to being a good leader on a sports 
team. 

Overall, what makes a good 
leader?As an athlete, you respect 
those who are better than you, and 
sometimes try to emulate them. 
Obviously, everyone wants to be 
good at his sport, but this is not 
enough to make him the individual 
that should be captain. A captain 
or a leader should be the player on 
the team that wants it the most. He 
is the first one there and the last 
to leave. 

Without that hunger, there is 
no point in even attempting to 
lead a sports team, as guys who 
work harder will have a hard time 
respecting those who do not work 
as hard as they do. If the best 
player on the team doesn’t put in 
solid work at practice, fools around 
and yet is still the best player on 
the team, he is not going to be very 
well-liked, as he isn’t working hard 
for the team, let alone himself. 

The hunger to be the very best 
is what drives leaders in the sports 
world. Kobe Bryant and LeBron 
James are currently in such a battle 
to be the best basketball players in 
the world. I don’t want to go into 
who is better here (that’s a whole 
other article, or book even). 

My point is, players like LeBron 
and Kobe are not the best by 
accident, though they both have

SWIMMING AND DIVING — Another week-
end of high-level competition ended with mixed 
results for the UCSD women’s swim team, as they 
defeated Cal State Bakersfield 186-101, but lost 

to Fresno State and San 
Diego State, 169-129 
and 183-111, respec-
tively, at the Hillman 
Aquatics Center in 
Bakersfield. 

The men’s team 
lost to Bakersfield 
169-125 and did not 
compete against the 
other schools. It was 
another arduous meet 
for a swim team that 
has been exhausted in 
recent weeks by the 
heavy competition they 
have been swimming 
with.

“We’re extremely 
fatigued right now,” 
head coach Scott 

McGihon said. “Winter break was a heavy train-
ing period, and last week we went heavy again, 
and were just sitting and thinking we didn’t have 
any speed at the beginning of the race, but we’ve 
got some speed at the back end of the race.”

It was a long meet for both teams, but there 
were many bright spots. Junior captain Alex 
Henley continued her dominance by taking the 
100-yard backstroke and the 100 butterfly with 
times of 57.67 and 58.21, respectively. Henley has 
now won seven different events in the last three 
meets.

Freshman Emily Adamczyk won the 200-yard 
individual medley 2:11.06 to claim another vic-
tory for the women. 

Junior Matt Herman won the long events 
for the men. He took the 1000 yard freestyle 
with a time of 9:33.52 and the 500 freestyle 
with a 4:41.29. Freshman Alex Merrill won the 
last event the Tritons would win on the day, 
as he finished first in the 200-freestyle with a 
time of 1:43.60. The 400 yard freestyle team of 
sophomore Amber Tan, senior captain Anju 

UCSD will face off against Cal 
State San Bernardino and Cal Poly 

Pomona this week, with Triton 
women on six-game winning streak.

“We’re never 
happy to not 

win a meet. “But 
we’re in a pretty 

good mood 
when we look 
at where we’re 

at in our training 
cycle.”
