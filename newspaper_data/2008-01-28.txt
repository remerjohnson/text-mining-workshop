Instead of the colorful walls surrounding 
some of Mandeville Center’s stairwells — com-
monly known to students as the “graffiti stairs” 
— those passing by will now find multiple lay-
ers of blue paint. 

The stairwells, along with other tunnels and 
corridors that contain graffiti in the Mandeville 
Center, have long been considered UCSD land-
marks. However, the recent reopening of the 
University Art Gallery — closed since 2006 for 
remodeling — has led UCSD administrators to 
start covering the graffiti. The gallery restora-
tion project included the revamp of the UAG 
and the painting of several walls that displayed 
graffiti.

“The area around Mandeville, particularly 
in some dark corridors near the University Art 
Gallery, had been overrun with what many 
perceived to be ‘trashy’ graffiti,” Associate Vice 
Chancellor of University Communications 
Stacie A. Spector said in an e-mail.

Spector said the graffiti seemed to be done 
by off-campus artists and was of very poor qual-
ity, which led to its removal. 

Some students, however, feel that the graf-
fiti provides a positive touch to Mandeville’s 
atmosphere.

Eleanor Roosevelt College senior Danya 
Michael, who often uses the Mandeville facili-
ties, said the graffiti adds to the vibrancy of an 
otherwise gray building.

“I have never seen anything offensive,” she 
said. “I always enjoy seeing the new things 
people put up. But in a sense, I guess the new 
paint is like a new canvas.”

Following a university-mandated summer 
recreational fee increase two years ago — which 
raised the compulsory student fee for use of 
campus sports facilities during the summer by 
more than 400 percent — the Department of 
Recreation is implementing several new exer-
cise options to relieve the “immediate sticker 
shock” and persuade students to head back 
to UCSD gymnasiums during the summer. 
However, officials say they cannot deny the pos-
sibility that fees will increase again when they 
are re-evaluated next year.

In 2006, UCSD moved to full state funding 
for the summer, converting the summer ses-
sions into full academic quarters and requiring 
the university to boost all fees in that period to 
match the fees of the Fall, Winter and Spring 
Quarters. Prior to that, the Department of 
Recreation imposed a $25 fee for full use of the 
sports facilities during both summer sessions, 
but the mandated conversion required the rec-
reational fee for enrolled summer students to 
remain constant throughout the year, raising the 
summer fee from $25 to $92.

Controversy arose that same year when for-

mer Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson and Director of Recreation Dave 
Koch agreed to extend the same pricing struc-
ture — an additional $67 for students enrolled 
in summer session — to nonenrolled summer 
students in order to ensure that both groups 
who have full access to the sports facilities pay 
a fair amount.

Koch said the summer immediately follow-
ing the fee hike faced dramatic financial conse-
quences, as total revenues from the summer rec-
reational card sales dropped almost 80 percent, 
or nearly $37,000. Although the new options 
and influx of new students helped alleviate the 
loss last summer, Koch attributed the drastic 
drop in revenue to the extreme difference in 
pricing between the two summers.

“Financially for us, that was a significant 
loss of anticipated income … because all the 
enrolled summer students were now having to 
pay the $92 RIMAC fee instead of purchasing 
those recreational cards,” he said.

Members of the Athletic, Recreation and 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board, a group com-
prised of both undergraduate and graduate 
students that reviews all spending of recre-
ational and athletic student fees, said most of 
the revenue lost had to be reappropriated from 
other sources by a special request to the advi-
sory board.

“In the name of fairness, every stakeholder 
lost: Thousands of nonenrolled students disen-
gaged, hundreds were made to pay an exorbitant

Voter turnout for young people 
has been historically inconsistent, as 
older voters are the traditional tar-
gets of political campaigns. However, 
this year’s election marks a significant 
change in candidates’ strategies, as the 
growing popularity of Internet cam-
paigning has diverted more attention 
to a younger demographic. 

Sen. Barack Obama’s (D-Ill.) sig-
nificant win in Iowa, largely due to 
a strong base of young voters, called 
attention to the frequently overlooked 
voting group.

It is evident from the candidates’ 
homepages that they are increasingly 
vying for support from young vot-
ers. Every major presidential candi-
date, with the exception of Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), has links to his or

Top: A staircase in Mandeville Center is covered in graffiti, which university officials labeled as “trashy” and 
have struggled to paint over since last quarter. Bottom: Another Mandeville staircase has been painted over as part 
of a University Art Gallery renovation project, though not all staircases in the building have been repainted.

As a graffiti artist who does custom T-shirt 
and skateboard designs, John Muir College 
senior Ji-San Lee said the graffiti in Mandeville 
benefits the community and provides a way for 
artists to relax from the stresses of everyday 
life.

“There are people who are just screwing 
around, but there’s also a lot of art that’s really 
beautiful,” he said. “When you start learning 
something, it’s not going to be graceful, so stu-
dents should have a place to try things out.”

It is illegal to graffiti on campus buildings, 
Spector said, and the act is punishable under 
state laws as a form of vandalism. 

“It’s like kids who skate on campus,” Lee 
said. “There are rules against it. So instead they 
just figure out things themselves, sneak out or 
things like that.”

Other students said the graffiti highlights 
the need for a designated campus location 
where students can create their art freely.

“If it’s against the rules then it should be 
removed, but I think there should be desig-
nated graffiti spots for students [to] express 
themselves,” Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
Vijay Rama said. “Graffiti is accessible [to] 
everyone unlike ‘real’ art, which is usually in 
galleries. [The graffiti] gives me something 
to look at besides the usually monotonous 
stuff.”

Despite efforts to repaint, graffiti contin-
ues to reappear regularly by the stairwells. As 
a result, more layers of blue paint have been 
added over the past few weeks. 

The artists responsible for the graffiti have 
not been located.

Readers can contact Jonathan Chu at jachu@ucsd.edu.

New payment options aim to 
increase facility usage, while a 
hike in student recreational fees 
remain a possibility.

Career Conferences
The University of California’s nine 

alumni associations are organizing 
the inception of two all-alumni 
career-advancement conferences. 

The one-day conferences, held 
in both southern and northern 
California over the next two months, 
are aimed at helping alumni and 
other members of the professional 
community successfully transition 
between jobs within or beyond their 
current fields. 

The events are designed to 
help professionals within a broad 
range of disciplines with three or 
more years of work experience. The 
conferences are being held Feb. 
12 at UCLA and March 18 in San 
Francisco. 

Hillcrest Med. Center Gets 
Grant to Help Uninsured

Health insurance companies 
UnitedHealth Group and Pacificare

Medical Center in Hillcrest. The 
contribution will aid expansion of 
a computer system that assists 
emergency-room doctors in 
sending uninsured patients to 
community clinics for follow-up 
appointments. 

The grant was part of $25 million 
in California grant funding pledged 
by the insurance companies in 
2005 to win regulatory approval of 
their $8.1-billion merger. 

The hospital said it will expand 
the San Diego Safety Net Health 
Information Exchange to patients 
outside the emergency room. In 
addition, it will increase the number 

of neighborhood clinics that are 
linked to the computer system. 

Matthews Becomes 
Permanent Vice Chancellor

Gary C. Matthews has been 
appointed vice chancellor of 
resource management and 
planning. A recognized leader in 
higher education management, 
Matthews has served as interim 
vice chancellor of resource 
management and planning since 
December 2006, when former Vice 
Chancellor John Woods retired.

“Given Gary’s distinguished 
career of more than 30 years in 
higher education, he is ideally suited 
for this important management 
position,” Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox said in a press release. “He 
has served in numerous leadership 
positions focusing on university 
governance and has considerable 
expertise in collaboration across 
organizational areas, developing 
and sustaining new approaches to 
challenging situations, engaging and 
encouraging diverse perspectives 
and effectively implementing 
organizational change.”

As vice chancellor, Matthews 
is responsible for some of the 
university’s critical functions, 
including policy development 
and management of the campus 
operating and capital budgets, 
capital planning, land-use planning, 
facilities design and construction, 
real-estate development, audit and 
management advisory services 
and administrative records. 

“I am honored to be appointed 
to this important leadership 
position,” Matthews said in a press 
release.

The current administration’s wan-
ing popularity has had a record-setting, 
adverse effect on Republican candi-
dates. A survey compiled by the Pew 
Research Center shows a 15-percent 
lead in Democratic Party identifica-
tion among 20-year-olds, the most sig-
nificant Democratic leaning for this age 
group since the Nixon administration.

Obama’s significant lead could be 
signified by his 272,000 supporters on 

Facebook  — more than triple that of 
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.).

Texas Rep. Ron Paul takes the gold 
for Republicans, with nearly 78,000 
supporters — who have become rec-
ognizably vocal — while former 
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney takes 
a distant second at 34,000 supporters.

Turnout figures bear particular sig-
nificance this year because Democrats 
have outnumbered Republicans by 
roughly 40 percent in primary polling

locations, according to a recent Time 
magazine report. 

Clinton, former North Carolina 
Sen. John Edwards and Obama have 
similar stances on the issues, and 
polls show that young voters, like 
their older counterparts, prioritize the 
economy as most important. Hence 
the uneven distribution of support for 
a single candidate is more difficult to 
explain, according to Gary Jacobson, 
a UCSD political science professor 
and  American politics expert.

“Young, educated voters like 
Obama’s style and his standing for 
something other than politics as usual,” 
Jacobson said.

He said candidates with a strong 
base of young supporters, however, 

should be weary because young vot-
ers are notorious for low turnout in 
general elections and do not tend to 
vote as a bloc.

“By the general election, though, 
I think they will be divided along 
partisan lines, just like their elders,” 
Jacobson said.

Similar trends are apparent in the 
Republican race.

Supporters of Paul, many of whom 
are young voters, denounce the prac-
tices of the mainstream media, claim-
ing Paul has been excluded from news 
coverage.

However, at an on-campus speak-
ing engagement last week, Newsweek 
Managing Editor Evan Thomas defend-
ed the media.

Thomas said the coverage of nonvi-

able candidates takes away from the 
decision-making process when the 
stage is too crowded.

Mainly older members of the San 
Diego community attended the speech, 
with only a handful of students scat-
tered throughout the room.

Jacobson said situations such as 
the turnout at Thomas’ speech are 
relatively common, and that high lev-
els of young voter turnout are often 
anomalous.

“Iowa was a caucus state where 
activists tend to predominate,” Jacobson 
said. “When broader electorates are 
involved, it is harder for any particular 
age group to stand out.”

fee and the facilities themselves lost 
revenue,” ARSFAB member Jonathan 
Weinberg said in an e-mail.

In order to further mitigate the cost 
and give students more recreational 
options during the summer, Koch said 
he has been working with ARSFAB 
to provide students with several dif-
ferent options for how to utilize the 
facilities. In addition to purchasing the 
full summer recreational card for $92, 
students can now purchase a half-sum-
mer recreational card for $46 for any 
six-week period during the Summer 
Quarter, a monthly recreational card 
for any four-week period that costs $31 
or a $3-per-day pass for RIMAC, main 
gym and Canyonview Pool. This sum-
mer, an occasional-use pass will also 
be available for students who wish to 
pay for approximately 15 visits to the 
facilities, although a price has yet to be 
assessed for that pass. 

Koch, however, believes that faculty, 
staff, alumni and community members 
ought to pay higher prices for use of the 

gymnasium and equipment, regardless 
of the price structure set for students.

“I did make the decision that, rather 
than a one-time huge increase for fac-
ulty and staff recreational cards, we 
would spread that over two to three 
years, and there’s one more year of that 
to put in place,” Koch said. “Ultimately, 
it will be $35 to $40 a year more for 
faculty and staff, and it will be twice 
that for the community.”

Prices are not necessarily stationary, 
however. The language of the original 
RIMAC referendum, passed in 1995, 
authorized the university to reassess the 
fee level every five years and provided 
the possibility for the fee to increase 
up to $5 quarterly per student. The last 
increase took place four years ago, and 
Koch said that within the next year the 
fee will be evaluated by the recreation 
department, the student affairs office 
and ARSFAB members. 

Koch said the fee may be raised to 
cover the expenses of the RIMAC facil-
ity, which include the debt service and 
maintenance on the building, alloca-

tion for the recreational department 
and capital reserve projects.

Weinberg said the summer fee hike 
for both enrolled and nonenrolled stu-
dents was necessary.

“Personally, I don’t understand what 
is more fair about this since enrolled 
and non-enrolled students constitute 
separate demographics ‘fairness’ at all,” 
he said. “Are we afraid that students 
would not enroll in the summer so they 
could get cheaper gym memberships?” 

Koch said he empathizes with stu-
dents, but believes that the principle 
— not the amount of the fee — was 
what drove him to agree with the hike.

“On the face of it, $92 is about $31 a 
month, which is still pretty reasonable 
for access to all the sports facilities on 
campus, even in a comparable market 
with private fitness companies,” he said. 
“But from my perspective, it wasn’t 
rational for nonenrolled students to pay 
a lower fee than enrolled students.”

University Depends on 
Librarians, Not Wikipedia

Dear Editor,
It could be argued that a universi-

ty’s most central facility is its library. 
Particularly at a major research 
institution like the University of 
California, the library is not only the 
primary repository for accumulated 
knowledge but the springboard for 
furthering that knowledge, whether 
the user is a student just beginning 
to explore a field or a faculty mem-
ber at its forward frontier. 

Over the last quarter century, the 
science of information storage and 
retrieval has progressed immensely. 
Today’s libraries are not just reposi-
tories for books and documents, 
but technologically advanced com-
munication centers with a global 
reach.

University-level research 
requires far more than Google and 
Wikipedia, and this university’s 
information search and retrieval 
systems are growing increasingly 
sophisticated. Librarians, especial-
ly in the UC system, must master 
more skills than ever to aid stu-
dents, faculty and other researchers. 
One would expect that, as profes-
sional demands increase, librarians 
would receive a concomitant share 
of the university’s resources. 

Unfortunately, even as student 
numbers and fees increase, along 
with dramatic jumps in top-admin-
istrator salaries, librarians have 
been losing ground to the rising 
cost of living.

A recent survey of UCSD’s 61 
professional librarians revealed that 
most work more than 40 hours a 
week. Part of this is due to the rising 
student population, and the library 
staff has not been increased enough 

to keep up. The remaining librar-
ians spend more time than ever 
working without increased compen-
sation. While the majority report a 
high degree of job satisfaction, they 

do wish the library had sufficient 
staff to accommodate their expand-
ed needs and more time to pursue 
professional activities such as their 
own research and training. While 

many librarians also report overall 
good working relations with library 
management, it is time for univer-
sity administrators to treat these 
information professionals as equal 
and respected partners in our edu-
cational mission. After all, universi-
ty administrators are willing to raise 
compensation for themselves and to 
attract and retain Academic Senate 
faculty members in California’s 
expensive environment. 

“Money is not everything,” said 
Fred Lonidier, president of the pro-
fessional union for non-senate fac-
ulty and librarians at UCSD. “But 
salaries have a major impact on the 
kind of librarians we can recruit and 
retain.” 

If the administration will not 
provide them with more time for 
professional and creative work, 
more staff or salary commensurate 
with their duties, the UC system 
will soon inevitably face reduced 

research and information services.
And that, we absolutely cannot 

afford.

Tenure-Track Professors and Librarians

Flu Season is 
Playtime for 
Secretaries, 

Nurses
January is flu season, so I didn’t think anything of it when I start-ed to develop a cough earlier this 
quarter. When it comes to doctor visits, 
there are two types of people: those that 
rush to make an appointment over the 
slightest sniffle and those that will hob-
ble around for four days on a nearly-
broken ankle before they angrily admit 
defeat; I’m the latter. 

Even as my cough turned to a sore 
throat, throbbing head congestion and 
weird ear pressure, I popped some 
Tylenol Cold and trudged to class. But 
when the sickness spread south and I 
spent one horribly sleepless night vom-
iting, I decided it was time to see what 
antibiotics could do.

On Jan. 16, I called student health 
at 9 a.m. on the dot. This was, as I 
had heard from the friendly answering 
machine minutes before, the time it 
opened. But instead of a person I was 
again greeted by the machine. 

“Hmm, the secretary must be in a 
little late today,” I thought to myself. “I’ll 
give her a few minutes.” 

But 15 minutes and three calls 
later, I was greeted again by the chip-
per, but now substantially more grat-
ing, answering machine. Annoyed, I 
pushed the phone-tree number that 
would allegedly direct me to a human 
being, only to be disconnected.

Taking a few deep breaths, I called 
one more time. Finally, rather than 
dropping my call, the obnoxious 
answering-machine voice redirected 
me to Catrina. Brimming with hope 
at the sound of a real human, I forgot 
my frustration and asked to make an 
appointment to see a doctor. But appar-
ently my any-time-you-have-available 
scheduling request was too much to 
handle, because rather than oh, I don’t 
know, do her job and book an appoint-
ment for this audibly sick caller, Catrina 
decided to play doctor and investigate 
my symptoms via phone interview.

Whatever, I never call student

UNIVERSITY CENTERS — Price 
Center is expanding, as many read-
ers well know by now. The $45-
million expansion, the site of the 
campus’ many construction cranes, 
is slated for March completion and 
aims to accomplish what the current 
Price Center evidently could not: 
accommodate the increase in pro-
jected student enrollment.

Yet, a visit to this seemingly 
unending endeavor’s Web site deliv-
ers facts that fail to show that the 
student body actually need two Price 
Centers in the first place. Indeed, 
given expectations for what pur-
poses the new building will serve, it 
would appear as though an increase 
in student enrollment is a weak 
excuse to argue in favor of enlar-
gening Price Center. While increases 
in enrollment would, rationally, lead 
to debates about the supply of on-
campus housing or future parking 
vacancy levels, expanding a seem-
ingly adequate university center 
seems like a dense proposition.     

By the year 2010, UCSD’s total 
enrollment is expected to break the 

30,000 mark if the volume of yearly 
applications continues at its current 
pace. There are an already tenuous 
circumstances surrounding hous-
ing availability, and any systematic 
increase in UCSD’s on-campus pop-
ulation would spike a new premium 
for living quarters. In addition, a 
recent audit by Campus Planning 
and Transportation and Parking 
Services found that the availability 
of parking during peak hours in the 
coming years will also take a hit.

At a fundamental level, then, the 
problem with breaking ground on a 
larger Price Center is that its plan-
ning assumes a deficiency in the 
degree of foresight necessary given 
the influx of new undergraduates. 
Instead, what the campus is left with 
is an expensive, student-funded con-
struction project whose number on 
UCSD’s figurative list of priorities 
should’ve been much lower.

Some of the primary bouts of skep-
ticism directed toward the new center 
stem from its logistical challenges. In 
order to wedge in the building, the 
western terminus of Matthews Lane 
needed to be shut down. Thus, not 
only were shuttle bus routes rerouted, 
but more importantly, any previous 

hopes for a Matthews-Myers-Lyman 
Lane connection that would ease traf-
fic congestion have been permanently 
dashed. Add in the prospect of more 
delivery and service trucks needed 
to maintain the new building, and 
you’ve got a profoundly large traffic 
problem developing.

The questions surrounding the 
new Price Center do not limit them-
selves to mere issues about conges-
tion. Questions remain as to which 
group of UCSD’s students will be 
forced to foot the bill as a result of 
a referendum in 2003 that effective-
ly approved the expansion of both 
Student Center and Price Center. 

Consequently, the referendum’s 
makeup stipulated that students 
would begin to be charged extra 
in their quarterly university centers 
fees once the new Price Center is 
completed. Yet the problem is that 
those who voted for this new build-
ing are now alumni, while those who 
are expected to pay up never got the 
chance to vote. 

It is now 2008 with the project 
incomplete — it has not benefitted 
anyone and will be paid for by stu-
dents who did not vote for it.

Priority is the operative word. 

And given the fact that student 
enrollment volumes are trending 
upward, it is only logical for one 
to consider the different avenues 
available to help an already stressed 
student body dealing with limited 
essential resources. Indeed, UCSD 
is adding a new dormitory com-
plex just north of Eleanor Roosevelt 
College in an effort to ease the living 
situation on campus. The bad news 
is that a portion of the north park-
ing area will be scavanged in order 
to make room for the new structure. 
Had the new Price Center area been 
afforded plans for a dormitory com-
plex, none of the vaunted parking 
lots would have been touched. 

But given that the new building 
is apparently nearing completion, it 
may be time to look ahead and make 
the best of what may turn out to be 
a quintessential example of bureau-
cracy trumping efficiency. 

So in an effort to alleviate the 
possibly adverse effects of future 
traffic congestion, one suggestion 
is to leave open enough space to 
connect Matthews Lane and Myers 
Lane. That way, at least the heart of

health; how am I supposed to know 
how this works? I told her all my symp-
toms, and she told me I should come 
to the urgent care waiting room. I 
explained to her that I had a busy day 
ahead of me and would prefer to book 
an appointment, even if it meant I 
would be seen later. Catrina told me 
if I wanted to make an appointment, 
she needed to forward me to a nurse 
who would evaluate my symptoms and 
schedule an appointment. 

Wait? Then what the hell was all 
this for? 

I said I’d like to make an appoint-
ment. She told me the nurse was busy 
and that if I came to student health 
before noon a doctor would see me 
right away. Too delirious to argue, I 
hung up the phone and made my way 
over.

When I got there, another student 
was checking in at the front coun-
ter. I waited behind her, and as she 
moved aside to fill out paperwork I 
stepped forward. Maureen the secre-
tary ignored me, looking down at her 
papers. She was middle-aged, but her 
hair was perfectly coifed in a harsh little 
bob and her petite features were sharp 
like a bird’s. 

“Hi,” I said. Maureen’s beady eyes 
glared up at me. 

“You’ll have to wait there until 
someone can help you,” she said, snap-
ping a glorified talon toward a wait-
here sign a foot behind me.

I couldn’t help but laugh; she 
wasn’t actually serious, was she? But 
as Maureen turned quickly back to her 
papers I swallowed whatever runny-
nosed, bleary-eyed pride I had left and 
took a big step backward. 

Fifteen minutes later — after 
Maureen decided to acknowledge my 
existence with a simple “fill out the blue 
form around the corner,” I noticed a 
sign telling me of a potential two-hour 

wait and we had lovely discussion that 
boiled down to her inability to schedule 
me an appointment — I again accepted 
defeat and plopped down on a wait-
ing-room chair. I was in this for the 
long haul.

I figured I should at least get some 
work done, so I opened my battery-
depleted laptop and plugged it into a 
nearby wall socket. Not five minutes 
later, an official-looking man came out 
of nowhere to inform me that I was 
not allowed to “tap into the electrical 
system” in such a way. 

And that was it; student health broke 
my mucus-y soul. Sensing my dejection 
as he watched me silently unplug my 
computer, the man added one more 
gem to student health’s bureaucratic 
stockpile of wonder.

“Yeah, you’re just not allowed to,” he 
said. “And the reason is: A lot of people 
want to, and you’re just not allowed.”

Yes, he really said that. I kid you 
not. 

My name was called a little over an 
hour later and a nurse — not a doctor 
— looked down my throat and told 
me to take some Sudafed, which, con-
veniently, isn’t sold at the on-campus 
pharmacy. 

So I pay $849 a year for the Student 
Health Insurance Plan, and the one 
time in three years that I get really sick 
and need to call upon student health 
for assistance, I’m harassed for two 
hours and sent home? Great.

I guess the daily hassles of ever-
increasing tuition expenses, cramped 
and costly housing, outrageous text-
book prices, overcrowded buses, 
downright shitty parking and a total 
rejection of student input just weren’t 
enough. Now UCSD’s staff is going 
out of its way to give sick students a 
big fat fuck-you when they’re at their 
weakest. 

So good luck, Tritons. Call me if 
you need some Sudafed.

the campus will be navigable by any 
vehicle.  

In addition, and perhaps more 
importantly, it is without question 
that the intention for the new Price 
Center is not to turn into the Student 
Center in terms of sustainability. 
Thus, the new center should attract 
clientele that will prove interesting

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

From answering frantic undergradute e-mails to conducting research with award-winning professors, 
graduate students make up a dedi-
cated and integral part of the cam-
pus community.

The specialization and profes-
sionalism of studies creates an indi-
vidual and unique experience for 
every graduate student. According 
to Jenwa Hsung, a graduate student 
in modern Chinese history, these 
students must have a passion for 
academic growth and exploration, 
turning an interest into a lifestyle. 

“If you’re a graduate student, 
you better love what you’re doing 
because it’s a lot of work,” Hsung 
said. “When it comes to interact-
ing with other graduate students, 
departments once again become a 
key issue.”

According to Hsung, depart-
mental isolation doesn’t symbolize 
the graduate-student experience. 

“The main reason I was an 
undergrad wasn’t just for academ-
ics,” Hsung said. “Part of the reason 
to go to a school is to try to con-
nect with the people around you. 
As a graduate student, academics 
are by far the most important thing 
that I am doing, and they always 
will be.”

Rather than feeling isolated 
because of departmental limita-
tions, independent and depart-
ment-specific bonds created in 
graduate school serve not only as 
social outlets, but as connections 
within academic fields and possible 
career boosters. 

“The people are the most 
important part,” Hsung said. 
“You’re stuck in classes with 
them for hours every week … 
and they’re the people you are 
going to know in the field.”

While working with fellow 
students ensures life-long col-
leagues, working with faculty 
members is probably the most 
crucial aspect of a graduate stu-
dent’s academic life. According to 
Hsung, forming respectable rela-
tionships with professors is a must. 
However, working with a professor 
to obtain a teaching assistant or lab 
position can sometimes take away 
from individual research.

“You’re always torn between 
how much time and energy 
and emotional effort you want 
to put into your teaching and 
how much to put into your 
own work,” said Amanda Brovold, a 
graduate student in the philosophy 
department and Graduate Student 
Association outreach coordinator. 
“Generally you want to put more 
than you have in to both of those 
things.”

With little time to spare as a 
result of demanding academ-
ic work, most graduate students 
become TAs due to financial needs 
or department requirements. 
However, the standard professional 
relationship with undergraduates 
seems to make somewhat of a social 
barrier between the two academic 
populations. 

“[Grads] talk about how under-
grads hate us and how we can 
change that, but I don’t think it’s 
all the undergrads — grad stu-
dents [feel a sense of separation] 

also,” Brovold said. “It is 
a sticky situation. It can 
make things uncomfort-
able when you have to 
grade someone that you 
want to hang out with.”

U n d e r g r a d u a t e 
students such as 
Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore 
Jenni Lundergan also 
feel a definite rift 

between graduate and 
undergraduate students because of 
the social division between the 
two communities.

“It’s harder to relate on a per-
sonal level to a grad student,” 
Lundergan said. “They’re in a dif-
ferent stage of life and a more spe-
cific environment. I don’t talk to 
[graduate students] unless they’re 
my TA. Graduate students defi-
nitely have a culture and a com-
munity all their own.” 

According to Brovold, with the 
exception of late nights at Porter’s 
Pub, graduate students tend to 
view campus as a place to work, 
while the Gaslamp Quarter and 
Pacific Beach are the places to 
play. 

In order to encourage social 
interaction between the campus’ 
departments of graduate stud-
ies, GSA hosts various events  in 
which graduate students from all 
fields of study can meet and min-
gle. As a fall-2007 admit to the 
graduate structural engineering 
department, Kate LaZansky found 
the GSA’s beginning-of-the-year 
beach party (complete with bar-
beque, burgers and beer kegs), a 
good way to acclimate herself with 
other graduate students and the 
social scene at UCSD. Nick Saenz, 
GSA vice president of academics, 
said events like these allow gradu-
ate students to view UCSD as more 
than just an academic institution. 

“The departments here can 
be very isolating,” Saenz said, “so 
[graduate students] are looking 

At Pomegranate Russian-Georgian Restaurant, the writing’s on the wall 
— literally. Located between Texas 
and Louisiana Streets on El Cajon 
Boulevard, customers at this dimly lit 
house-turned-restaurant are allowed 
to write their compliments to the 
chef, or simply make their mark, on 
whatever surface (ceiling, bathroom, 
vintage piano) they see fit. The din-
ing environment is kitschy, fasci-
natingly mixed with wall-mounted 
Russian propaganda posters, lamps 
with Russian newspaper clippings 
glued to their shades and chili-pep-
per lights hung from indoor tree 
trunks.

While diners are treated to an 
entertaining eyeful once seated, 
they’re also given a reason to laugh. 
Pomegranate’s menu, which is pref-
aced with the restaurant’s motto, 
“Borscht by the bucket, vodka by the 
inch,” pokes fun at Russia’s historical 
figures like Stalin, bashes Napoleon 
for his failure to conquer the 
motherland and claims dishes like 
Shashlik — a tantalizing pork loin, 
vegetarian or lamb dish marinated 
in pomegranate juice and grilled 
over prunings — saved the 1944 
accord in Yalta between Churchill, 
Roosevelt and Stalin. Although com-
ical, the menu is honest; appetizers 
like Vareniki, potato cheese dump-

lings, and desserts like Kutuzov Soup 
Vishnya, a rich wild cherry soup, 
are both extraordinary and pleasur-
able. As for beverages, Pomegranate 
serves fine quality vodka, beers and 
Chilean wines. Designated drivers 
for the night can try the Russian 
Samovar Tea or an extra spicy 
Blenheim ginger ale.

Be warned: make a reservation 

and bring cash. Otherwise, you 
may find yourself apologizing to 
an unforgiving, domineering host-
ess and paying unreasonable service 
charge fees. The meal is both filling 
and satisfying, so don’t be afraid 
to ask for a box and take it home. 
After all, the food is so delectable 
that one visitor scribbled, “If my 
girlfriend falls asleep tonight … I’m 

making love to these leftovers,” on 
the restaurant’s bathroom wall.

MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  7

The sound of honking horns filled the air, engines rum-bled and shouts rang out 
from behind me. The buildings 
along Kasr el-Aini, the avenue run-
ning perpendicular to the main 
campus of the American University 
in Cairo, rose up into the fog of 
pollution. 

My return to Cairo after 30 days 
of travel was a bit surreal. I was 
excited to be home. I considered 
it home now — despite my lack 
of an actual house or apartment 
— and while I was eager and happy 
to land once again at the Cairo 
International Airport, I felt a bit 
strange returning to a place where 
so many of my friends would no 
longer be living, and where I knew I 
would be in limbo until classes start 
on Feb. 4.

Nevertheless, the chaotic life of 
Cairo pouring west from Talat Harb 
Square and the Tulip Hotel, where I 
spent my first few nights in the city 
five months ago, was a warm wel-
come back. From Tahrir Square, the 
smog and shouts, the noise of  com-

muting masses drifted down past 
the campus alongside Garden City, 
home to many study-abroad stu-
dents and several embassies, right 
to the street off Kasr el-Aini where 
I spent a large part of the afternoon 
searching for apartments.

Wandering the streets of Cairo 
and searching desperately for a 
decent but affordable apartment in 
the city’s center took me back to 
my first few days in Egypt, when I 
found myself alongside several curi-
ous Americans, bustling through 
the shock of a new place and a new 
culture.

Many of those students have 
since returned home. My first 
semester roommate Ben Barclay left 
with no small amount of sorrow but 
was content to face new challenges 
at his U.S. university in Minnesota. 
Others I knew left eagerly, long-
ing for the ease of the comfortable 
surroundings they grew up with. 
Missing friends, family and, in 
some cases, baseball, these semes-
ter-long study-abroad students did 
not regret their choice to spend a 
shorter time overseas.

During a recent chat about 
departing American students, an 
Egyptian friend said she thinks 
most students coming to Cairo 
leave without fully experiencing the 
city, without knowing what it is 
to be an Egyptian, or to truly live 
in Cairo. Foreign students’ semes-
ters abroad in Egypt are bullets 
on resumes — foreign experience 
for international relations students 
— and little more.

If I had left Cairo in December, 
I’m not sure my study-abroad expe-
rience would have been much more 
than a bullet point for me either. 
I cannot be certain that after a 
full year I will have even touched 
on what life in Egypt is really all 
about. Studying at the university we 
are surrounded by a bubble — one 
that is hard to break — but after 
reflecting on the experience during 
my winter travel, I intend to try 
harder during the second half of 
my year by speaking Arabic more 
often, spending time with Egyptian 
friends rather than only American 
students and finding an apartment 
in the heart of downtown. 

Unlike myself, Brigid Grund, an 
archaeology major from Boulder, 
Colo. who began studying at AUC 
in the fall, would rather head home 
now. She has discovered what she 

wants out of Egypt, and learned 
it is not for her. Brigid’s issues 
with Cairo relate to some of the 
challenges that come with being a 
woman in the Middle East, such as 
harassment. But no matter the city, 
someone will always be too far out 
of their element. 

Around 1 a.m. on Jan. 25, 
Becky Fogel and Anoush Suni from 
Claremont arrived in Cairo, elated to 
be in Egypt and to start their spring 
semester. They were immediately 
offered a slew of unsolicited advice 
and enthusiastic stories. Certainly, 
many of the spring semester’s new 
arrivals will find the same — a 
stark contrast to the confusion and 
learn-by-mistake approach of fall’s 
arrivals. They’ll still have a chance 
to learn for themselves, but with 
added guidance, spring students 
like Fogel and Suni may have the 
opportunity to make more of their 
time in Cairo.

The choice whether to study 
abroad can be a bit daunting; choos-
ing where can present another chal-
lenge. But perhaps one of the hard-
est decisions, in retrospect, would 
be how long to stay overseas. The 
problem I am discovering is that 
there is no good way to deter-

mine which choice will be the right 
one, and students I’ve met study-
ing abroad in Paris, London and 
of course Cairo, all have ups and 
downs. Everyone knows a student 
who wished they could be home, or 
could have stayed longer. 

The atmosphere of the second 
semester is likely to be much differ-
ent from the first, and I would bet 
that the spring semester students 
will be caught up in it, rather than 
follow the trends we experienced in 
the fall. Does this mean they will 
have a fuller experience? Perhaps. 
But really, the experience is about 
the person and about their goals 
and choices. Barclay, Grund, Fogel 
and Suni, as well as myself, are tes-
taments to the diversity of students 
here in Cairo and the diversity of 
options. How can you be sure which 
choice is right for you? You can’t. 
One thing I can say for sure, no 
matter when you choose to study 
abroad, where you choose to study 
abroad or for how long — just make 
sure you get something more than a 
bullet on a resume.

for those avenues to broaden their 
social circles and certainly that’s 
one of the roles of GSA: to break 
down some of the very fierce bar-
riers that exist between [depart-
ments].”

GSA also aided the growth of 
the graduate student community 
by partnering with UCSD Housing 
and Dining Services to incorporate 
Cafe Vita into its new graduate 
housing, One Miramar Street.

Additionally, HDS is current-
ly working on a 400-bed hous-
ing project in the Health Sciences 
neighborhood to provide housing 
for 50 percent of all graduate stu-
dents. According to HDS Director 
Mark Cunningham, the opening of 
One Miramar Street and Cafe Vita 
has allowed graduate students to 
enjoy individual experiences while 
being part of a larger community. 

“The graduate residents choose 
to form their own communities 
within our housing facilities and 
are almost completely self-suffi-
cient,” Cunningham said in an e-
mail. “[Graduate] housing tends to 
be more like a neighborhood with 
neighbors being friends and col-
leagues.”

Ultimately, the graduate experi-
ence is an individual one. While 
an unbridled passion for anything 
from philosophy to structural engi-
neering keeps graduate students 
dedicated, a more relaxed and inti-
mate social atmosphere allows them 
to choose their level and intensity 
of social activities.

of play. 

Despite the personal achievement, 
it was the mark in the loss column, 
and not the point total, that stuck with 
Patterson after the game.

“It doesn’t matter if you score 100 
points and you lose,” Patterson said. 
“Coming off of last night we were really 
pumped up and we knew we had to 
redeem ourselves. Unfortunately, it just 
didn’t work out that way.”

Lawley scored 15 points with 
four rebounds and two assists, while 
Kim contributed 14 points with four 
rebounds and four assists against the 
Otters. Allard pitched in with 13 points, 
three rebounds and four assists.

As a team, UCSD shot 56.9 percent 
from the floor, committing only 11 
turnovers. However, the Otters con-
nected on 59.1 percent of their three-
point opportunities, turned the ball 
over only twice more and held a slim 
rebounding edge.

The record-sized crowd on 
Spirit Night was intensely cheering a 
Triton team that was off to its best 
start in the program’s Division II his-
tory. Unfortunately, the Tritons’ game 
against San Francisco State did not 
begin as impressively as their previous 
games, as both teams struggled from 
the floor, with UCSD shooting only 30 
percent and the Gators connecting on 
just 36 percent of their first-half field 
goal attempts. After Lawley hit one of 
two free throws to tie the game at 14 
with 10:18 left in the half, both squads 
suffered from a nearly four-minute 
scoring drought that included seven 
missed shots, four fouls and three turn-
overs. Junior forward Darryl Lawlor 
ended the scoring lull with two free-
throws at the 6:27 mark as the teams 
scored only six points each in the final 
10 minutes of the half and went into 
the break tied at 20.

The two teams remained close 
throughout the second half, turning 
up the intensity and putting on a show 
for the raucous Spirit Night crowd. 
Again, defense would play a bigger role 
than offense, with the largest lead of 

the half amounting to only a six-point 
Triton advantage. Two successful San 
Francisco State three-pointers cut the 
UCSD advantage in the final min-
utes. The Gators would tie the game 
from the free-throw line at 48 with 
just over a minute remaining. Neither 
team allowed a score before the buzzer, 
sending the teams into the five-minute 
overtime. San Francisco State put an 
unhappy end to the Spirit Night festivi-
ties, scoring the first 12 points in over-
time and not allowing the Tritons to get 
closer than six the rest of the way.

Carlson said that the Tritons could 
have performed better and should have 
come out of the weekend with at least 
one win, but he is confident that the 
Tritons still have their best perfor-
mances ahead of them.

“There have been very few games 
where we haven’t been in or had a 
chance to win,” he said. “If there’s one 
encouraging point, it’s that I don’t think 
we played close to our best this week-
end, but we still had chances to win. 
We competed well ... we’re just not 
closing the deal.”

Junior guard Andrew Hatch led 

UCSD on offense with 12 points in 26 
minutes off the bench, while Lawlor 
and Kim added 10 points apiece. 
UCSD recorded eight steals and forced 
20 Gator turnovers, but San Francisco 
State won the rebounding battle, 42-
33, and held the Tritons to just 4-of-19 
from three-point range.

The Tritons will attempt to end 
their two-game slide as they conclude 
their five-game home stand this week 
with a Jan. 29 matchup against Grand 
Canyon. UCSD will then visit Chico 
State on Feb. 1 and Cal State Stanislaus 
on Feb. 3.

Patterson said he has no doubt that 
the Tritons will bounce back and play 
to their potential this week.

“We just need to keep our focus and 
the main thing is staying together. A lot 
of teams have a tendency during adver-
sity to stray apart from each other and 
develop grudges against one another,” 
Patterson said. “We just have got to stay 
together as a family and weather the 
storm. We’ll get through it.”

midrange jump shot to give the 
Tritons a 32-21 lead, and UCSD 
extended the margin to 43-29 with 
13:17 left in regulation.

The Gators, however, remained 
resilient and pecked away at the 
Tritons’ lead during the final 13 min-
utes of the game. San Francisco State 
converted on a three-point play with 
8:53 remaining to cut the Tritons’ 
lead to 50-45. The Tritons, with the 
crowd behind them, shot the ball 
well from the free-throw line late in 
the game and held off the Gators in 
their comeback attempt.

Elliot said that Triton Tide was 
much appreciated in staving off the 

Gators.
“I really think the crowd made 

the difference 
in the last five 
minutes of the 
game,” Elliott 
said. “They 
were yelling and 
screaming and 
were into the 
game.”

Noud, Osier, 
Mezzetta and 
Gaskin all 
scored in double digits, with Noud’s 
14 points leading all Tritons. Noonan 
scored seven points while collecting 
nine rebounds and Valenzuela added 

six points off the bench.
The win on Spirit Night was spe-

cial for the players 
because it was one 
of the few times 
this season that 
the Tritons could 
play in front of 
such a large 
crowd.

“We loved 
having the crowd 
and we loved the 
fans,” Noud said. 

“It’s always my favorite home game of 
the year. It’s great having the support 
from our peers.”

UCSD’s next game on the road 

against first-place Chico State on 
Feb. 1 should prove to be a difficult 
contest for the Tritons, who hope to 
make up the one game that separates 
them from first place in the CCAA. 

“Chico plays very well at home 
and they shoot well,” Noud said. 
“They don’t lose often at home.” 

The Tritons will follow that game 
with a road contest against Cal State 
Stanislaus on Feb. 2. UCSD defeated 
both of these teams earlier this sea-
son and hopes to sweep both of 
the season series with victories this 
weekend.

MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

line for UCSD.
With the Tritons in complete con-

trol of the game in the second half, 
UCSD tapped into its bench, which 
was very productive in the game.

“We got contributions all around 
and we used everyone,” Noud said. 
“That makes for a successful game.”

Noud had a game-high 22 points 
for the Tritons with Osier being the 
only other Triton in double digits for 
scoring. Osier had a great all-around 
game, scoring 13 points, collecting 20 
rebounds and adding three steals. 

The Tritons’ win over Cal State 
Monterey Bay came in front of a con-
siderably smaller crowd than their 
victory over San Francisco State one 
night earlier. UCSD pulled out the 
close win over the Gators in front of a 
large crowd of 1,220 spectators on the 
university’s annual Spirit Night. 

The Tritons found themselves in 
an 8-2 hole to start the game, miss-
ing three three-point attempts in the 
first two minutes of the game. UCSD 
managed to stay close in the game, not 
giving the Gators a chance to open up 
a larger lead in the contest. The two 
teams battled for most of the first half, 
tying the game on four occasions. 

With the game tied at 19 with 3:55 
to play in the first half, the Tritons took 
control of the game on baskets from 
freshman forward Neyra Valenzuela, 
senior center Alexis Gaskin and a 
three-pointer from Mezzetta. With one 
second left in the half, Noonan’s jump 
shot missed the mark and Valenzuela 
threw the ball back up and into the 
basket to give the Tritons a 30-21 lead 
at halftime.

Noonan opened up the scoring for 
the Tritons in the second half with a

Tritons Bounce Back With Rout Over Bulldogs

SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN
The UCSD ice hockey team fell for the second time this season to UC Irvine on Jan. 25, but bounced The UCSD ice hockey team fell for the second time this season to UC Irvine on Jan. 25, but bounced 
back the next evening against Fresno State, scoring early and often to trounce the Bulldogs 13-2.

By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

CLUB SPORTS —CLUB SPORTS —CLUB SPORTS  UCSD returned 
home to mixed results on Jan. 25 and 
26 against UC Irvine and Fresno State 
after successful matches against Loyola 
Marymount University and University 
of the Redlands on Jan. 18 and 19. The 
Tritons fell for the second time this 
season to UC Irvine on Jan. 25 by a 
score of 6-3, but bounced back against 
Fresno State with a 13-2 blowout vic-
tory the following evening at UTC Ice 
Town.

In the Tritons’ match against Fresno 
State, UCSD took advantage of its first 
power play of the night, scoring an 
early goal to take a 1-0 lead. Minutes 
later, a slapshot from junior forward 
Troy Miller put UCSD up 2-0. 

The Tritons controlled the puck 
and kept play in the Bulldogs’ zone 
for much of the first period. On one 
rare occasion, Fresno State pushed 
play through the neutral zone and 
the Bulldogs scored a goal to cut the 
Tritons’ lead to 2-1. But junior forward 
Chris Bachman responded with anoth-
er goal for the Tritons, putting them up 
3-1 at intermission.

Within the first minute of the sec-
ond period, the Tritons scored another 
goal. Then, with 17:45 left in the period, 
freshman forward Stephen Lockwood 
broke away and slipped the puck past 
the hapless Bulldog goalkeeper to put 
the Tritons up by four. 

The Bulldogs, who played defen-
sively for most of the game, finally 
answered back with a goal to cut the 
Tritons’ lead to 5-2 with 11:21 left in 
the second period. However, Bachman 
banged a shot into the high corner of 
the goal before sophomore forward 
Michael Frederick passed the puck to 
sophomore forward Casey Gong, who 
scored another goal to give the Tritons 
two quick scores and a 7-2 lead. UCSD 
added two more scores in the period to 
take a 9-2 lead going into the break.

With the game out of reach for 
the Bulldogs, UCSD continued its 
onslaught, adding four more goals in 
the final period, including scores from 
Gong, Miller and senior forward Tim 
Armstrong.

The Tritons wanted to atone for 
their previous loss, and their merciless 
and unified play gave the Bulldogs a 
long and sad ride home.

“After a so-so game [the night 
before] we came out strong tonight,” 
freshman defenseman Will Cho said. 
“Our team banded together and we 
weren’t selfish.”

The win came after the Tritons took 
a tough 6-3 loss to UC Irvine one night 
earlier. The Tritons struggled for much 
of that game, digging themselves into a 
6-1 hole after two periods. It didn’t help 
that they racked up an unusually high  
amount of penalty minutes.

“The first two periods of the game, 
we were in the [penalty] box the whole 
time,” junior defenseman Matthew 
Robinson said.

Not willing to leave without a fight, 
the Tritons outscored the Anteaters 2-0 
in the third period, but by then it was 
too little, too late and UC Irvine took 
the victory.

“We lost focus,” Cho said. “We could 
blame the referees for the loss but we’ve 
got to play the game better.”

Now with a 9-6 record, the Tritons 
have three more games left in the regu-
lar season. UCSD will face Cal State 
Northridge on Feb. 2 and Sacramento 
State on Feb. 8, and will finish its 
schedule against UC Davis on Feb. 9. 
All three games are at home and the 
Tritons are confident that their history 
with their opponents will lift them to 
much-needed victory.

“We’ve beaten two out of the three 
teams that we’re playing this season,” 
Robinson said. “We need to win the 
next three games.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
Tritons ended the first half of their 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association schedule with two solid 
wins at home, pushing their confer-
ence record to 7-3. UCSD used a 
strong second half to defeat Cal State 
Monterey Bay by a score of 68-51 on 
Jan. 26, and posted a 64-58 victory 
over San Francisco State on Jan. 25 in 
front of a large crowd on Spirit Night. 
The Tritons are currently tied for third 
place in the CCAA — just one game 
out of first place going into their next 
contest. 

UCSD burst out of the gates against 
Cal State Monterey Bay, taking a 12-
2 lead with three-point baskets from 
sophomore forward Erin Noonan and 
senior guard Meaghan Noud. After the 
Otters scored a basket, Noud hit anoth-
er three-pointer, giving the Tritons a 
15-4 lead with 11:05 left in the half. 
UCSD maintained control of the game 
for most of the first half, extending its 
lead to 15 points with 7:45 left in the 
first half after a three-pointer from 
freshman guard Mollie McIntyre.

 The small and quick Otters stormed 
back into the game, shooting well from 
beyond the arc and ending the half 
on a 16-6 run to cut the Tritons’ lead 
to three.

According to UCSD head coach 
Charity Elliot, the Otters’ run was the 
result of a letup from the Tritons. 

“We got complacent in the middle 
of the first half and allowed them to 
climb back into the game,” Elliot said. 
“You have to give [the Otters] credit 
because they kept playing hard.”

The Tritons, holding on to a 28-
25 lead, answered Cal State Monterey 
Bay’s run with a run of their own to 
start the second half of the game. After 
junior forward Michelle Osier collect-
ed an offensive rebound, senior guard 
Alexis Mezzetta rattled in a jump shot, 
and the Tritons continued their surge 

by scoring nine unanswered points, 
giving them a 37-25 lead with 16:38 
remaining.

The Tritons continued their suc-
cess, blocking the Otters’ attempts to 
get back into the contest. With the 
Otters double-teaming UCSD’s centers, 

the Tritons consistently found open 
players on the outside for uncontested 
shots. The Tritons were also able to 
execute several baseline drives, which 
resulted in layups and trips to the foul

MEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD had 
a long and disappointing weekend at 
home, losing to conference opponents 
in two overtime games on consecutive 
nights.

The Tritons fell to San Francisco 
State University on Spirit Night, Jan. 25, 
by a 68-58 final score, taking the game 
into overtime in front of a record-sized 
crowd of 3,906. The next night, UCSD 
went on to play two extra periods, and 
lost 97-93 to Cal State Monterey Bay. 
With the losses — the Tritons’ first at 
home and first back-to-back confer-
ence defeats all season — UCSD stands 
at 9-6 overall and 6-4 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play. 
Now just past the season’s midway 
point, UCSD sits tied for fourth place 
in the CCAA.

The battle between the top two 
three-point shooting teams in the con-
ference was decided from long dis-
tance when Cal State Monterey Bay 
and UCSD squared off. Unfortunately, 
while the Tritons held the statistical 
advantage entering the game in three-
point defense, the Otters sniped well 
from behind the arc at both the end 
of the fourth quarter and the overtime 
periods.

The Tritons’ competitive spirit 
guided them to a 27-26 lead at half-
time. Head coach Chris Carlson’s squad 
would find itself up again in the final 
minutes of the game, seemingly ready 
to avenge its loss from the previous 
evening to San Francisco State.

With the Tritons up four and under 
a minute to go, senior guard Clint 
Allard drew a foul and went to the line 
for a one-and-one opportunity. Allard 
could not convert on the first attempt 
and Cal State Monterey Bay took pos-
session, responding with a three-point-
er from way behind the arc to cut the 
Tritons’ lead to 64-63 with 17.2 seconds 
left on the clock.

Sophomore guard Jordan Lawley 
responded on the other end, draw-
ing a foul and calmly knocking down 
two free throws to push the lead back 
to three points. However, the Otters 
made another miracle three-pointer, 

connecting from the corner with just 
three-tenths of a second left on the 
clock, that sucked the air out of RIMAC 
Arena.

Having come so close to victory, a 
determined UCSD squad came out fir-
ing in the overtime period, taking the 
lead and going up two possessions after 
an Allard three-pointer with 2:30 left 
to play. However, the Otters’ hot streak 
from long distance tied the game at 77 
with just over a minute left. Junior for-
ward Henry Patterson then helped the 
Tritons regain the lead, moving around 
two defenders for a layup and one of 
his 18 successful field goals, coming by 
way of only 20 attempts. Unfortunately, 
the Otters would again tie the game in 
the waning seconds, and a jumper from 
junior guard Kelvin Kim was off the 
mark on the Tritons final possession of 
the first overtime. 

Patterson again struck first for 
UCSD in the second extra period with 
a layup, but the Otters responded with 
a three on the other end. But this time, 
Cal State Monterey Bay would be the 
one to take a lead in the final min-
ute. Despite a staunch Triton defense 
that forced a crucial turnover on an 
inbounds pass, the shots would not fall 
for UCSD as the Tritons lost their third 
overtime game in four chances.

According to Carlson, the double-
overtime loss stretched the limits of the 
team and tested its worth.

“Coming out of that adversity you 
learn how tough you are and what the 
measure of your group is, both indi-
vidually and collectively,” he said. “We 
competed well. We just didn’t compete 
well enough.”

Carlson said that Patterson’s explo-
sive performance was outstanding but 
that the Tritons could not convert on 
all of their opportunities.

“Offensively, we didn’t execute a 
lot of things we wanted to do tonight. 
Henry Patterson had a good game, but 
we want to try and execute a few other 
things and I had to ride Henry too 
much,” Carlson said. “Tonight we relied 
on him so much to make shots and we 
just weren’t clicking tonight.”

Patterson set a career-high with 37
