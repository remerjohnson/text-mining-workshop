Sabo, Possibly First 
Woman AS Pre~ident, 
Has Activist History 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Writer 

"Being a woman has never been a campaign issue," AS 
Presidential candidate Linda Saba says. "I'm running 
because I feel I'm quali6ed in terms of experience and 
committment. " 

Saba, in a run·off race for pre.ident with "Very Saly 
Student." slate candl· 
date Jeremy Charlton, 
would be the 6rst wom'an 
president in AS history. 

Although Saba feels 
"becoming the first 
female AS president here 
is not my primary 
concern," she has been 
actively . involv,ed in 
women's programs on 
campus and has been a 
strong advocater of 
women's. rights. 

A core member of the 
Lind. Saho Wom~'s Center and !he 

center s representallve 
to the Student Affirmative Action Committee last year and 

part of this year, Saba has been "instrumental in almost 
everything the center does," Women's Center coordinator 
Nancy Helgeson said. 

"l..ind~ worked on the pro.choice rally educating people 
about abortion legislation last fall and is now very involved in 
organizing the upcoming sexual harrassment conference," 
Helgeson said. 

She was also responsible for establishing a work.study 
position at the center, a move which "basically saved the 
center from disbanding," Helgeson concluded. 

The Women's Center hopes that "more women and more 
intdest might be attracted to the center" should Sabo become 
AS president. 

Sabo, despite the fact that she feels her sex should not be a 
con.ideration in this election, has forrn).llated some ideas on 
being a female politician during her three years of experience. 

"There are certain positive and negative aspects abour 
being a woman in politics," she said. 

"When I've dealt with legislators and the .Regents in the 
past , I've picked up definite paternalistic signals, like when 
they call me 'dear' or 'honey.' Yet it can be vary 
advantageous working with system-wide administration if 
you're intelligent, articulate and female ," she admitted. 

Sabo also feels men tend to be "more open and less 
competitive around me as a women," possibly advantageous 
in lobby situations. 

As far as the AS Council is concerned, Sabo feels that 
being a woman "has made me see and treat certain issues a 
lit~e differently in the past" and would continue to do so if she 
became president. 

"Child care and the Racquetball Club's showing erotic films 
on campua are two issues I was concerned with as a woman 
on the Council this past year," she said. "I realize how

Phones' for 
Dorms by 
Mid-80s? 

BY MARK ESTES 
An AS proposal calling for 

the permanent inltallation of 
telephones in aU on· campus 
dorm and apartment rooms by 
the mid·I980s has been 
submitted to UCSD T ele· 
communicationl Services. 

Muir .AS Representative ' 
Robb Strom, who made the 
proposal, originally hoped that 
it might be in effect by next fall, 
but he says that now seems 
imf>C>ssible. 

The existing phone system 
on campus cannot accomo· 
date the approximately 2,100 
new lines that are required for 
the plan, and T elecommunica· 
tions Manager Harvey 
Campbell, after consulting 
with Pacific Telephone 
Coinpany, estimates that any 
sufficient new system will 
require 18 to 24 months to 
design, engineer and install. 

The main beneficiaries of 
Strom's plan are the students 
who live on campus he says.

'Burn~d Out' SDSP 
Cancels Week's Plans 

Students Aren 't Taking 
Draft Seriously, 'They Say 

BY ALICE ROCKEY 
StaffWriW 

A statewide rally, scheduled 
as part of a week of anti·draft 

' activities on California 
campuses, was cancelled at 
UCSD because San Diego 
Students for Peace members 
say they were "burnt out." A 
rally planned by the California 
Campus Anti·Draft Coalition 
failed to materialize and there 
have been no other visible 
manifestations of the 
organization's " anti-draft 
week." 

Scott Kessler, a member of 
the SDSP, offered an 
explanation for the apparent 
inactivity of that organization. 
He said they "didn't have 
time" to organize a rally at 
UCSD this week. "We're 
trying to get organized and 
plan strategies," he. added. 

another SDSP member, 
UCSD students are "naive." 
"A lot of students don't feel the 
draft is real yet-they'll 
respond when they see a real 
threat: 

"The SDSP is interested in 
raising consciousness with 
small but numerous events," 
Soana said, "induding letter 
writing to congress and the 
appropriations committees, 
printing and posting anti·draft 
posters around campus, and 
educating the students m 
understanding and resisting 
the draft." 

Two weeks ago, during 
Work Opportunity Week, 
SDSP challenged US Navy 
campus recruiters by setting 
up a desk directly aeross from 
the Navy recruiting area.

Brown Odd-Even Plan Nears 
End-Local Efforts Ahead 
SACRAMENTO - A Brown 

administration proposal to replace statewide 
odd-even gasoline . sales allocations with 
county·level conservation measures was sent 
to the Assembly Ooor yesterday. 

The vote was 11 · 1 in the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee. 

Assemblyman Larry Kapiloff, D·San 
Diego, author of AF315 7, said the local 
proposals will work better than a statewide 
odd·even program because "even when a gas 
crunch comes, it does not fall evenly 
throughout the state." . 

Kapiloff's measure would allow counties to 
devise their own programs to keep gasoline 
use below the average consumption over the 
past three years. 

Only if a county failed to stay within tha t 
limit for three consecutive months, could the 
governor impose odd-even measures or other 
conservation measures. 

Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. imposed the odd· 
even plan in 14 counties last May and lifted it 
when gasoline .supplies increased. 

He reimposed it statewide in November 
because of the crisis in Iran, but as gasoline 
supplies have stabilized, the plan has been 
widely ignored. 

Under odd-even, motorists can buy 
gasoline only on days corresponding to the 
last number of their license plates: odd 
numbers on the first, and 10 on. 



Brzezinski Must 
Also Step DoU!" 
Vance Resignation Only 
Solves Half Policy Problem 

BY RICHARD FALK 
PacIfIc New. s.w. 

O ne shoe Iuu fallen: that of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who voluntarily resi(rned in response to the rejection of.bia foreign policy approach. 
It iI now time for President Carter to kick off the other 

shoe: national aecurity advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, whose 
record of repeated faiures in foreign policy has brought the 
nation to ita present impasse. 

Let us consider the record 01 thi, man who now all but 
openly charts the nation', course through ~ Mideast storm. 

Falk i. a member of the Council on Forei,n Relations and 
a ' Profes.or of International Law and Practice at Princeton 
Uniuer.ilJ/. 

n.e ainlle greatest feature of Brzezinski'. foreign po~cy 
had been his cOlllistendy militarist aproach to almost ev~y 
international policy crisis the Carter Administration had 
confronted. ' This singIe·minded approach had fueled an 
American faith in military power which had blinded the nation 
10 the limited utility of force in the complex worid of the 
19so.. 

1he hostage re.c:ue fiasco -il illu.trative of this misplaced 
faith. But Io~ before the rescue effort was mounted, the 
p-oblem could be Been in the thinly disguised tug of war 
between the diplomatic approach represented by Vance and 
the militariatic approach repreaented by Brzezinski. 

Indeed, to point a finger at Brzezinski identifies only the 
moat alaring defects of Carter'. approach to foreign policy. 
Cart.r himaelf seems genuinely in over his head and may 
have allowed Vance and Brzezinski to generate opposing 
linea 10 .. 10 evade the relponsibi~ty of standing behind any 
particular direction. 

B rzezinaki's hard line t;merged long before he joined the Carter Administration. More ardently than most hawks, he went down to the last wire supporting the 
American interventiOn in Vietnam, counseling a toullh stance 
against domestic dissent. Later, he supported American 
military intervention in Angola. 

As national aecurity advilOr, Brzezinski has been 
c:onIistently UIOciated with anti-detente views, ranging from. 
turninc tunan rights in an anti·Soviet direction to favoring an 
ac:ceJ.ated .rrna race. MOIl relevantly, Brzezinski was 
allOCiatecl with a die-hard, pro-shah policy. Throughout the 
Iranian revolution, he counseled "decisiveness" by the shah, 
namely maximum and brutal use of state power against 
unarmed mass dernonstJations. 

Late in the game, when moat other_ in Washington had 
liven up on the shah, Brzezinski continued to plot for his 
IUl'viviai. He even circumvented the American emballY in 
Tehran by havinl a special military officer, Gen. Robert 
Huy-, report directly, on a daily basil. 10 the White HOUle. 

We now know what wulongsuspected, namely, that Gen. 
Huyser was in Iran to incite a military coup at an opportune 
moment that never came. We allO know that Brzezinski 
counseled Carter against any acknowledgement of the 
Khorneini movement long after its triumph was a virtual 
certainty. 
. The background is relevant to the whole deterioration of 
the American po_ition on Iran. contributing directly to the 
emballY crisis. It was Brzezin.ki who was the voice in 
Carter's ear, favoring continued friendship with the shah after 
his departure from Iran in 1979. In this regard, the publicized 
shah lobby of David Rockefeller and Henry Killinger was 
reinforced by the entrenched preaence of Brzezinski in the 
White HOUle. 

Brzezinski's early relationship with Carter already owed 
much to the patronage of David Rockefeller, with whom 
Brzezin.ki had worked as staff director of the R~efeller­
organized Trilateral Commillion. 
'T he triangular relationship of forces creat~ pre5Su~e t? 

admit the shah to the U.S. last fall, despite all the indi-
cations that such a step would critically damage our 

relations with the Iranian revolution, as well iu undermine, as 
it did, the position of moderates in the Iranian governing 
process. Even the embassy seizure was foreseen as a possible 
c-onaequence of the shah's admiaaion here. 

But despite Brzezinski's influence, Vance seemed, even as 
recently as last December, to be fighting Brzezinski's high 
noon temperament to a virtual draw. ' 

Then came the Soviet move into Afghanistan and the 
Brzezinski-orchestrated American over·reaction to it. 
Brzezinski - photographed firing a machine gun across the 
Afghanistan·Pakistan border - struck fast and prevailed. 
Since then, the illusion that only military approaches _ 
macho diplomacy - can solve the problems faced by the 
U.S. abroad had grown alarmingly. 

I n the mosi truculent State of the Union addreu in more than a decade, President Carter virtually revived the Cold War. He proposed the creatkin of a mobile ! 
interventionary force for use in the Middle East and a new 
charter for the CIA that would fully restore its mandate to

'Profess'ional' Candidate Sabo Will 
Not Represent All Student Interests 
Editor: 

Presidential candidate 
Linda Sabo's promise to 
"serve a broad base of 
students" seems less than 
poaaible to me in light of her 
campaign statements, and 
particularly _a statement she 
n;lade as AS external affairs 
commissioner. 

Aboui people who would 
register for the draft, Sabo 
said, "1ney don't Bee a 
threat, and they were 
brought up to do as they are 
told. They regiller because 
it's the easiest thing to do, 
and because they don't know . 
what to do with their 6ves." 
(Daily Guardian, Jan. 31, 
1980). 

Whatever their reasons, 
15 to 22 percent of those 
who voted expressed a 
willingness to register for the 
draft. It is outrageous that 
one who promises to 

repreaent all students could 
make such a blanket 
statement about a substantial 
part of her constituency. 

What i. more ironic is that 
one of her beliefs i. that "the 
AS gets out of the Student 
Center ... and finds out what 
they're representing"-
implying that the present AS, 
of which she is a member, 
doesn't really know who they 
are representing. 

I certainly don't want a 
preaide~ who makes up her 
mind on student iuues long 
before she knows what 
students really want. 

Another area 01 concern is 
the .fact thaJ Sabo puts 10 
much emphuis on her 
"connections" with the 
current AS, unlike another 
candidato who stated "firat 
and foremost, I'm a student 
at UCSD" 

I don't' think we need 0; 

should have ' professional 
candidates running for the 
AS. If the situation is at the 
point where we need career 
politicians. to run ASUCSD, 
then something needs to be 
changed. 

Finally, it seems as ilthe 
AS is being turned into a 
political machine-some-
thing which I am not sure I 
want, given the poaaibility of 
certain people being at its 
control •. 

Perhaps presidential 
candidate Jeremy Charlton 
has the right. perspective on 
the whole matler. He doesn't 
seem to want to make the AS 
anything it isn't, and 
shouldn't be. Charlton's 
calling the current AS 
"absurd" and "much too 
political" hits the problem 
right on the head.

FTC Shuts, Down

another 30 days. 

After passage in the House, 
the bill then would have to be

The FTC's 1,750 em· pl~yees. in Washington and 10 
regional offices showed up for

no guarantee that they'd be 
paid and th.ei.r elforls w~e

Four blocks east of FTC 
headquarters, in the Capitol, a 
bill to transfer $7.6 million 
from a State Deparbnent 
appropriation to the FTC 
waited to be called up for 
consideration in the House of 
Representatives. 

Meanwhile, the agency's 
normal tasks went undone. 
There was no testing 
cigarettes for tar and nic~tine, 
no fighting false bus mess 
daims, no court defense of 
restrictions on advertising. 

A federal appeals court 
appearance in New York was 
postponed, lawyers were re-

Also, the SDSP posted 800 
flyers urging students to 
"torment a recruiter" while 
they were on camp us , 
according to SDSP member 
Ruth Rominger. . 

This week, the Marine 
Corps and Navy cancelled 
scheduled appointments at the 
Career Planning and 
Placement Office. A sergeant 
(who declined to be identified) 
at the San Diego Marine 
Corps Recruiting Office 
denied that the cancellations 
had anything to do with SDSP. 
"We're not afraid of them," he 

Lt. Pat Hill , a recruiter who 
was present at the Navy desk 
during the WOW confronta-
tion, also said that a scheduled 

. second visit to UCSD was 
cancelled because of lack of 
productivity_ He denied any 
concern over pressure from 
the SDSP and noted that the 
re c ruitment office had 
received no letters or calls 
from them. "We will probably 
be on campus long after the 
students in the SDSP have 
graduated," he said.

The existing .phone system,

It also presents the

working telephones available

lailed to qualify lor the final

in the qualifying event.

meeting the teams had raced

coming out on top by hall a

LMU crew had their sights set 
on upsetting the Tritons this 
time around. 

LMU and UCSD surged 
ahead at the start, leaving 
three other boats in the wakes. 
The Tritons got off to a quick 
lead as freshman stroke 
Christine Hoffman brought the 
rating up to 45 strokes per 
minute. 

" My stroke may have been 
too quick," Hoffman 
remarked. "I brought it down 
to 36 strokes per minute for 
the body of the race, which is 
still quicker than we are used 
tb." 

The Eight apparently tired 
out.three quarters through the 
race and was passed by 
Loyola with ·250 yards 
remaining on the 1000 meter

Women's Clinic to 
Stress V-ball Basics 

BY SCOTl' ALLISON 
Staff Writer 

In an attempt to get a head 
start on the tough field of 
competition awaiting next 
year's women 's volleyball 
team, UCSD coach Doug 
Dannevik has organized 13 
practice sessions this month 
for aU those who wish to 
participate next ~son. 

"They're not for the purpose 
of cutting anyone," said 
Dannevik. "I just want to see 
who has the desire, and just 
what the nudeua of the tearn 
will be." 

The first practice begins at 4 
pm on May 5, at which time 
Dannevik hopes a Hock of 

unknown volleyball talent will 
grace the Hoors of the main 
gym. Fundamentals and 
conditioning will be stressed at 
each seuion, according to 
Dannevik. 

The spring wor'koul5 are in 
strong contrast to las t year, 
when Dannevik wasn't able to 
prepare the tearn because he 
wasn' t appointed coach until a 
few days before the season. 

Dannevik, however, 
stepped in and guided the 
T ritonl to a fourth place fingb 
in the nation.

The theatre group i~ ,tiD in 
the precarious infant .tages of 

development, with their first 
production just around the 
corner. According to Huerta, 
the group "is in the very stages 
of forming in downtown San 
Diego. We have no theatre of 
our own, but our home base 
right now is the Centro 
Cultural de la Raza. " 

The group, an off-shoot of a 
UCSD student group, consists 
of about a dozen people, 
although the size is · still 
fluctuating. The acting 
company consists of Goya

Correa, Jose Gonzales, Larry 
Aragon, Tina Alleguez, Silvia 
Cortez (who il directing one of

ourselves after some of the

Critic Sheed Allows Humor to Make Points 
The Good Word, and Other 
Words, by Wilfrid Sheed, 
Penguin , $3.95. 

Offering advice to would-be 
critics, Wilfrid Sheed writes , 
"So a reviewer who would rise 
must learn to roar and gush 
and roll on the stage in mirth or 
pain, making 01 book and self 
a single spectacle, a Main 
Event. Excess (in moderation) 
is good for business." Judging 
Irom the consistently 
entertaining "excesses" which 
appear in The Good Word and 
Other Words , Sheed usually 
heeds his own advice. 

A piece ca lled " Men ' s 
Women, Women's Men" 
which appeared in 1971 at the 
very height 01 the national 
hypersensitivity to racism and 
sexism, deals ruthlessly and' 
quite honestly with the 
problem of hypocrisy in 
criticism. Reviewers too often 
slant their reviews if the author 
is Black, or a woman , or 
anything other than the 
standard cliche of a male 
WASP. Deal with the content 
01 the literature itself, Sheed 
advises, and don 't worry about 
who wrote the book unless the 
subject matter directly calls for 
a reference to the sex or the 
race of the author. This seems 
like reasonable, advice 

to a reviewer in 1980. But a t 
the beginning of the 70s when 
the embers of the civil rights 
movement wer e still 
smouldering and the women's 

Sheed was impatiently 
encouraging reviewers to duke 
it out with all writers, 
regardless of sex or race. 
Critics are basically 
untrustworthy , Sheed insists, 
and maintains that criticism 
should at least be as direct and 
straightforward as pOssible 
without additional obfusca-
tion. 

Speaking of his own har~h 
harangue of the critics Pauline 
Kael, Andrew Sarris, and 
John Simon, Sheed snichers, 
"Criticism is a contact sport; 
and besides, who will criticize 
the critics, if they don't jump 
each other?" 

--

Books/ 
Chris Sherman 

movement was just beginning 
to blaze, many critics adopted 
an embarrassed, almost 
patronizing tone in their 
reviews of works by women, 
Blacks, and if Sheed is to be 
believed, most other 
"minorities". Allowing some 
of his sensible British 
upbringing to show through, 

Sheed is often at his best 
when poking lun at some 
person or some revered 
institution . He is the master of 
the one·liner: "Books about 
suicide make lousy gifts ... " 
and "01 Ezra Pound, as of 
Bobby Fischer, all that can 
decently be said is that his 
colleagues admire him." 

Anyone interested in 
criticism or the delicate art of 
reviewing witr find Wilfrid 
Sheed both enlightening and 
sobering. A combination of a 
serious approach to his craft 
and a self-critical sense of 
humor make his essays 
delightful to read. Too bad 
more reviewers don't follow his I 
advice. As Sheed himself 
notably expresses it, "Ah, 
well, scribble scribble."

Sheed is very good at 
criticism - he treats his 
subject seriously, but adopts a 
playful, entertaininJot style of 
writing which is a pleasure to 
read . The essays in The Good 
Word , most of which 
originally appeared in The 
New York Times , deal with an 
amazing variety of subject 
matter, from pornography to a 
brief history of the Beat 
movement to personal 
biographies of James Thurber 
and Graham Greene. Sheed 15 
an adept conversationalist 
capable of turning over all 
manner of thoughtful stones. 
He seems religiously careful to 
avoid the common "holier-
than-thou" altitude which 
plagues many critics who feel 
they have some sort of 
"responsibility" to the "literary 
public" or to posterity or 
whatever . T~mara E. May and Bill Dunnam, in John Steinbeck's

In the media made me sensitive to certain things such as the

Bill Topkia, vice-presidential run·off candidate on Sabo's 
"Student Interests Not Special Interests" slate, also feels Sabo 
"would be aware of certain issues that a male president might 
downplay or overlook, such as sexual harassment. " 

AS Pre.ident Carols Montalvo agrees , citing the "below

Elaine Bergman, middle

"We're looking for people

we're realistic about going all

engage in covert operations overseas, also moving the U.S. 
closer to a draft and a bigger defense budget. At the same 
time, he withdrew the SALT agreement from the Senate a nd 
imposed a variety of sanctions on the Soviet Union. 

The subsequent hostage rescue plan was not only a failure 
on the operational level but a diplomatic and constitutional 
disaster. American a llies had been cajoled against their better 
judgmellt to go along with economic sanctions against Iran 
because they feared that otherwise military force might be 
used. Despite assurances to the ·<:ontrary, the U.S. 
g~,,:ernment nevertheless unilaterally embarked on a risky 
military adventure. The resulting loss 0/ confidence and trust 
by Western Europe and Japan in the Carter Administration is 
a serious price to pay in the nuclear age. 

The same applies to the relationship between the 
Presidency and Congress. The 1974 War Powers Act 
requires advance consultation with Congress in the event that 
an act of war is committed. The Administration's refusal to be 
bound by the enacted laws of the land can only be interpreted 
as an instance of unconstitutional governance, no matter 
what efforts are made to gloss over the military charade!' of 
the miNion with terms like "Rescue Operation." 

Such developments weaken the security of the country_ 
Indeed, Brzezinski's militarist advice on how to deal with the 

I~anian rev?lution almost seems deliberately designed to 
gIVe the SoVIet Umon an opportunity to expand its influence 
in the region_ As well, it places the U.S. in opposition to the 
flow of history - needlessly antagonizing Islam and 
revolutionary Arab nationalism.
