1,000 housing 
spaces added 
By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
SItdI "rim 

UCSD is currently adding 
I ,()()() spaces on<ampus housing. 
This extra space will be available 
to students fall quarter '88, creat-
ing approximately 1/3 more 
housing than presently exists. 

Larry Barrett, UCSD housing 
director, commented on the rea-
sons for the increase in housing: 
"It is mandated by the state legis-
lature that the University of 
California enroll the top 12 per-
cent of graduatin, classes from 
California high schools. And I 
believe that the projected enrol-
lment for UCSD will be in excess 
of 20,000 when the campus is 
completed ... 

The rising cost of off-campus 
housinl is also a factor in the 
increase in the number of units 
on campus. "Housing is a basic 
necessary that needs to be covered 
not only for freshmen, but also 
for continuing students in order 
to make the university attractive · 
to that top 12 percent," said Pat 
Danylyshyn-Adams, resident 
dean of Muir College. 

"UCLA is also going through 
a tremendous build-up in hous-
ing for the same reasons we are 
- an increase in the cost of off-
campus housing, ~nd the increase 
in con.estion around the cam-
pus from the city's expansion," 
added Danylyshyn-Adams. 

"We always wanted to be able 
to have more than just freshmen 
living on campus, .. said Barrett. 
"Now we have the flexibility to

Co-ops ask/or 
independence 
in referenda 
By JILL COLLEY 
C".,../rttnre 

This year's A.S. ballot includes 
a co-op management referendum, 
which is an advisory referendum 
calling for separate management 
boards for the student-run servi-
ces of the Student Center and the 
services of the future University 
[Price] Center. 

The referendum is said to 
assure that these student-run 
services will not be subsumed 
into the demands of the Univer-
sity .Center .. 

The Co-op and Enterprises 
(CAE) board is a sub-committee 
of the University Center Board 
(UC8). The UC Junctions to 
insure that the lties of both 
the Student Center and the Uni-
versity Center are meeting the 

n~d! of the students, fllculty 
and staff. . 

The members of the CkE 
board feel that the UCB already 
has enough on its hands in terms 
of dealing with the demands of 
the University Center and that it 
is in the best interests of both 
centers that they maintain se-
parate managing boards. 

Jim Carruthers, director of 
the UCB, said that he feels there 
is plenty of room in the UCB for 
understanding the concerns of 
the co-ops and that their needs 
are represented through the 
existence of the CkE sub-com-
mittee. 

One reason in favor of estab-
lishing separate governing 
boards, say members of the CkE

UCSO's Harris appointed chief of 
head and neck surgery 

Jeffrey p, Harris, M.D., Ph.D., has recently been 
appointed chief of the division of otolaryngology / 
head and neck surgery at UCSD. 

Harris, an ear surgeon who also heads a well-
established research laboratory, is an international 
authority on the effects of the immune systems on 
ear (unction. His laboratory is one of only three in 
the world studying deafness caused by an 
autoimmune response, a condition in which the 
immune system mistakenly regards its own body 
cells as enemies and attacks them. 

Harris is one of only a few surgeons on the West 
Coast performing skull base surgery, which is 
considered to be one of the most challenging areas in 
surgery because of the vital structures involved and 
the inaccessibility of lesions in that area. 

Scholar awarded American Cancer 
Society postdoctoral fellowship 

Laure J. Reynolds, Ph.D., post graduate research 
chemist at UCSD has been awarded a two-year 
American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellowship to 
study the mechanism of action of phospholipase A2, 
an enzyme which is important in the body's 
production of prostaglandins. 

Prostaglandins are derived from fatty acids in 
animals and perform a variety of hormonelike 
actions, for example, controlling blood pressure or 
smooth muscle contraction. 

She will carry out the study under the dire~tion of

with bleachers of 2,sao seats. 
The Chargers are donating a 
locker room which can accom-
modate men and women. On the 
side of the locker rooms is a 
weight-training patio. 

"The old fields were built for 
6,000 students, now there are 
16,000 students. The new fields 
will rectify the outdoor space 
problem,"said A. W. Russ, auist-
ant vice chancellor of under 
graduate affairs. 

The extra space that the new 
fields provide will enable the 
older fields to be shut down and 
renovated. Currently, the fields 
which are used for sports such as 
track and soccer are in poor 
condition because they are used 
all the time. They were built as a 

"make~o," Russ said. Also, the 
extra space will provide more 
space for intramural games so 
that more teams will be able to 
play at the same time. 

The new track surrounding 
the football field is an all-
weather track which enables 
runners to set records. The 
current track is made of dirt. 

For six weeks each summer, 
the Chargers will be using the 
multi-purpose field and the entire 
locker room with weight-training 
area in exchange for their dona-
tion of that building. The build-
ing and fields are expected to be 
completed for their training this 
summer. The building may cost 
up to $1 million. 

For the past 10 years, the 
Chargers have conducted their 

summer training at the Warren 
wcst field and brought in trailers 
to do their weight training. 

Also. the women's softball 
team has been using the field at 
the Jewish Community Center 
on Eastgate Drive. 

Russ mentioned that the next 
problem to be solved was "the 
crunch for floor space." The in-
door sports facilities are allo 
inadequate to support the intra-
mural games_ Intramural volley-
ball and water polo play until 
midnight, and intramural bad-
minton plays until I am.

... think that the central hous-
ing office is just trying to make 
students aware that we do have 
all this new housing," said Pur-
pura of the advertising campaign 
goin. on to pUblicize the new 
housing. 

At UC Santa Cruz, only fresh-
men are luaranteed on-campus 
housing and then only if they 
enroll in the fan quarter. Con-
tinuing students receive houling 
on a lottery system. 

"We've been in overflow in on-
campus housing for a few years," 
said Carol Douglas-Hammer 
of the UCSC Housing Contract 
Office. "It's a tight market off 
campus. Students can only find 
something if they are really wil-
ling to aet out and look." 

This situation is similar to 
most UC campuses, but not 
exclusive to UC. 

At the University of San 

Diego all single freshmen who 
do not live at home are required 
to live on campus. But Sharon 
Adams, secretary of housing at 
USD, contends that there is not 
an overcrowding problem be-
cause new dorms wre opened at 
the campus this year. 

"But I do think that the stu-
dent pays more for housing on 
campus," said Adams. "I base 
that assumption on the fact that 
many students who live off cam-
pus live three or four to an 
apartment and share expenses." 

A large overcrowding prob-
lem exists at SDS U, and housing 
at the university is given on a 
first-come fint-serve basis. A 
student at the SDSU housing 
office said that the secret is to 
apply early.

Co-ops, however, are subsid-
ized by the UCB, whose budget 
is mostly derived from the $12.50 
per student per quarter Student 
Centerfee. One of the responsi-
bilities of the UCB is to insure 
that this money is spent in the 
best interests of the students. 

"The subsidies which the co-
ops receive is not minimal," Car-
rut hers said and because the UCB 
is responsible for the allocation 
of student. paid fees, it is to the 
advantage of students that the 
co-ops be accountable to the 
board that subsidizes them. 

The co-ops and the UCBare at 
odds over this issue of subsidiza-
tion. "Our staff time in terms of 
co-op activity is about $40,000 a 
year," Carruthers said. The uni-

payroll but they won't let us," 
Murachver said. She and many 
co-op members feel that these 
subsidies are often more hassle 
than help. 

Creating a separate manage-
ment board "does a lot of things 
that I don't think the co-ops are 
considering," said UCB Com-
missioner Evan Weisenfeld. "I 
think all they are considering is 
how they can best serve them-
selves," he added. 

Weisenfeld said that creating a 
management board separate-
from the UCB would take away 
the representation of all students. 
He said he thinks the current sta-
tus of the UCB and the CclE sub-
committee ought to be main-
tained. 

In addition to the co-op man-
agement referendum, there is a 
second referendum concerning 
co-op autonomy. This referen-
dum states that co-ops are an 
alternative to traditional univer-
sity operations and it is meant to 
assure student support of co-op 
autonomy so that co-ops can 
remain a real alternative. 

"The university has several 
times threatened to interfere with 
co-op decisions and resources. 
Certain administrators have even 
gone so far as to suggest that the 
university owns the co-ops," 
Murachver said. "I don't think 
they understand the notion of 
students making decisions for 
thcmselves," she added. 

UCSD co-ops "have an amaz-
ing amount of autonomy" in 
comparison to many co-op situ-
ations at other universities, 
according to Carruthers.

Footb.1I 
Students don't often get a chance to vote on large 

fee increases; we usually receive fee packets in the 
mail with the increase a fait accompli. 

Tomorrow and Wednesday provide a welcome 
change. Students will vote on whether to assess 
themselves an additional $45 a year to support a 
football team and provide some monies for other 
interCOllegiate athletic programs. 

The debate over whether to have a Division III 
football team has been extensively debated in these 
pages and the campus community over the past few 
weeks. 

To sum up, the Guardian recommends a "no." 
• UCSD students·already pay the highest fees in 

the UC system; an expensive program used by a few 
and with no administration support does not justify 
raising fees further. 

• A football team violates the ragged but right 
philosophy of the athletic department, which has 
emphasized the participant over the spectator. The 
athletic department funds men's and women's pro-
grams in almost all sports; football would become 
the most expensive athletic program with no analo-
gous women'~ program. 

• Football programs are the Frankensteins of 
sports. O~ce. they're established, there's no telling 
where they will go or how much money they'l need. 
A future chancellor or vice chancellor of under-
graduate affairs who took one too many hits as a 
second string undergrad tight end may decide to 
expand the program to Division I or II. Using this 
referendum as precedent, he'l ask us to pay for it. 
Even at the Division III level, there's no guarantee 
that the team won't eat more than the proposed 
$30/ year maximum share. 

• The referendum says admission to the games is 
free . It's not; we all pay S45 whether we go to the 
games or not. That's not fair to students who won't 
attend the games or can't afford the money. 
The Co-Op Referend. 

There are two Co-op referenda on the ballot this 
year. Both are advisory with no immediate practical 
effect on the student center or co-op structures, but 
both are important to the future of the co-ops. 

One referendum would support the principle of 
enterprise representation in management of the stu-
dent center. It's sound management: give the gov-
erned all the opportunity they can handle to set their 
own policies. 

The other would reinforce the principle of co-op 
self-management. Currently the co-ops, designed to 
be democratic in the truest sense of the word, fight a 
heirarchical, bureaucratic administration hostile to 
the basic fact of co-op existence. If the co-ops, for 
example, don't want to pay core members more 
than other workers, they have to fight an adminis-
tration which sees the word "core" and reads "junior 
executive." 

The only practical effect ofthese two initiatives is 
to reaffirm student support of the co-ops as they 
fight to maintain their unique education and eco-
nomic structures. 
Collele Council Money 

Some of the college councils currently exhaust 
their budgets before the end of the year; this initia-
tive would provide them with slightly more money, 
essentially allowing these colleges to tread water as 
Fifth College is added. Further increases may be 
needed later, but the colleges have demonstrated 
through their extensive programs a clear need for at 
least this increase.

A.S. Candidates 
Presldellt: M.yn.rd Dlmmetd.le

Vice Pr~sld.ellt Ert~'IUII: V.uabn Rex 
Pr0l'tlmmilll: Jonatban Judaken 

The A.S. has become a clubby, ineffective han-
gout for junior aChiever types. It has shown a con-
sistent inability to raise new issues with the adminis-
tration and confront old ones. 

Further, the socia-political base of the A.S. is 
virtually nothing: only about 15 percent of the stu-
dents are expected to vote. Only three of the 22 
candidates for the main offices are women, and two 
of those are running against each other. Only one 
candidate is black. UCSD is virtually ignored in 
consideration for statewide UC student posts. Sup-
port for students who are active, like the students 
who rallied in support of an effective communica-
tion department, is nil. 

The process offinding candidates to endorse has 
been numbing. The candidates parrot one another 
in safe answers to difficult questions, with virtually 
no original thinking and no enthusiasms except for 
themselves. 

Consequently, we are endorsing less than half the 
races; for the rest, we can't find any candidates we 
can recommend with the hope that they'll make any 
kind of difference in students'lives. 
President 

Maynard Dimmesdale is a bright, articulate can-
didate from outside; the A.S.'s inept structure; his 
experience in student government was at Arizona 
State, from which he transferred to UCSD. He sup-
ports alternative media and is a fervent believer in 
expanding the base of A.S. support: he wants to get 
Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women more involved 
in the A.S. through active outreach programs. 

The administration, he says, is indifferent to both 
ethnic minorities and the student popUlation as a 
whole; he's in favor of a kick in the ass for Atkinson 
and others just to let them know we're here. 

Many ofthe A.S. problems this yearare problems 
of perspective: it's not that the fraternity-dominated 
government acts explicitly in its own interest; it's 
that the perspective is too narrow to recognize other 
interests. 

Dimmesdale's presidency would work on that 
problem; we wholeheartedly endorse his candidacy. 
Vice Prnldent Administrative 

John Robison has been part of the A.S. for two 
years as a Muir Senator and has acquired a work-
ing knowledge of ·the government system. As V.P. 
for Administration, he would chair the weekly meet-
ings and order the agenda. Experience is critical for 
the post and Robison has it. 

Vice President Extem.1 
Vaughn Rex wants to expand the External post, 

restoring it to a position of prominence in the San 
Diego community and in systemwide administra-
tion. The town and city council outreach program 
initiated by incumbent and opponent Mordecai 
Potash reaches only La Jolla now; Rex wants to 
bring it to the whole city, but particularly ethnic 
communities in the area. 

He is committed to restoring a presence in sys-
temwide politics; perhaps he can get UCSD the 
student regent or lobby director we've lacked for 
years. He's a bright, articulate and impressive can-
didate, and we recommend him bi,hly. 
highly.

Chiao 
Coatiaued from pap 1 
tional powers the president has, 
such as requesting progress 
reports from subordinate bodies, 
[and] making sure people are 
accountable for their work. I see 
the A.S. presidency as being a 
managerial position ... I plan to 
keep my nose in everything. 
G: So that's how you define the 
job, as a marwer? 
C: In some respects , but it's also 
a voice of the students. I hope 
that there are times people don't 
like what I say, and we stimulate 
political debate. 
G: Do you have any particular 
goals? 
C: A co-op bookstore. We would 
all love to buy books for less, and 
it's something that can be done. 
The problem is that the book-
store doesn't like the competi-
tion, so you have to fight the 
administration. Maybe the A.S. 
could start the bookstore , get it 
on its feet, but from the onset we 
put in the condition that, once its 
going, the A.S. will give com· 
plete control to the co-op man-
ager, so we get our butts out of 
there. The co-ops need the polit-
ical backing of the A.S. because 
that's all we can really give them. 
G: What are your qualifications 
for the job? 
C: My best qualifications are my 
managerial skills, my ability to 
work with people . Certain peo-
ple you have to be tough with, 
other people you have to be very 
friendly with, and I have a pretty 
good sense of that. [Therefore] I 
can get what I want through, or a 
close compromise of that, with a 

variety of different people. 
G: Are you a member of a 
fraternity? 
C: No. 
G: Do you think the A.S. i. too 
Greek-oriented? 
C: Yes, I do. And I think a lot of 
people on this campus do. It's 
prejudiced to say that all the 
Greeks are bad, but thl.t's a 
generalization that has been 
made, and that I agree with, at 
least right now. 

Waldichuck 
Contiauecl from pale 1 
endum. 
G: That's the only plank on your 
platform? 
W: More or less, that's about it. 
Outside that . . . taking outra-
geousness to extremes, perhaps; 
walking beer vendors on cam-
pus, perhaps. [Also], abolish the 
no-skate-and-bike rule on cam-
,pus. 
G: Why should a student vote for 
a candidate like you instead of 
one of the serious candidates? 
W: Because [they're] sick of the 
typical, ev.;ryday, good look 
frat-boy type of everything; just 
for a change, to stir things up 
and get new people to show up at 
the polls. 
G: There are a certain amount of 
things you have to do if you're 
A.S. president, certain papers 
you have to sign, etc. Are you 
willing to do those things? 
W: 111 decide upon that upon 
seeing the things 1 have to sign, I 
guess. 
G: How much money is given to 
you [All Night Party slate] to 
campaign with? 

W:Zero. We haven't campaigned 
at all. We're strictly underground, 
I guess you could say. [ mean, it 
annoys me to see a whole bunch 
of Team Unity [another slate] 
signs that are all torn down all 
over the place, and people 
annoying me between classes 
handing out flyers . 

Maynard 
Coatiaued from pa .. 1 
stration has been able to do that 
is because the students haven't 
been opposing any of that . 
G: What are your particular 
goals? 
D: Basically, to get with the 
administration ... and start 
expressing alternative ideas. Like 
the football team. Everybody 
wants a football team, but very 
few people want to fund a foot-
ball team. If the administration 
wee to at least offer something 
for the football team, then the 
students would be willing [to 
support the team]. 
G: How are you qualified for the 
job? 
D: [ can effectively deal with 
administrations, even large ones. 
[Dimmesdale is a tranfer student 
from Arizona State University). 
I think this administration is a 
little more accessible [than 
ASU's], but then again, I don't 
think it takes the student go-
vernment as serious, and that's 
because ofthe governments we've 
had in the past. 

I'm also a lot older. I'm 26 
years old, and [people] seem to 
take me a little more seriously. I 
think even faculty and staff would 
support me. 

G: What's the biggest problem 
you see with the A.S. this year? 
0: [ think they have been pretty 
responsive. But I don't think 
they've been very alert or very 
active in student affairs. Com-
munication students had their 
little disruption last quarter -
government should have been 
there! They shouldn't have waited 
for the students to come to the 
government, they should have 
gone to the students. The skate-
board policy - where was the 
government opposition? I'm 
pleased with what the have 
accomplished, but I'm disap-
pointed they didn't put out more 
effort. 
G: Describe how you'd like to see 
the A.S. operated. 
D: I think the governmenty 
should go out into the students, 
and not the students go out into 
the government. 
G: Are you aware of the conflict 
between the government and the 
alternative media? 
D: Yes, and that's ridiculous. I 
wholeheartedly support alterna-
tive media. I think it's humor-
ous, in that the government was 
so blatantly irresponsible. If the 
government could do something 
for even a small group of stu-
dents, then I think it should. Not 
funding [the alternative media], 
specifically the New Indicator , 
hurt some students. It did not 
help anyone. Any exposure that 
people can get [to journalism] 
should be endorsed, should be 
nurtured, with what little facili-
ties we have. 
G: What do you think the A.S. 's 
priorities should be in giving 
funds? 
D: It should be in helping all stu-

dents, not the most students, but 
all students. As long as it doesn't 
hurt anyone. 
G: Are you a member of a 
fraternity? 
0: No. That's not to say I don't 
support them, it's just that 1 
don't need what fraternities have. 
G: Do you think that this school's 
A.S. i. either too Greek-oriented 
or too conservative because of 
that [the Greek orientationP. 
D: Well, yes. I don't want to say 
that's the only reason, but I think 
it has a little to do with it. I sup-
port the Greek community, but I 
don't think they're able to Jive 
themselves to the school, [and) 
there might be a conflict of inter-
est at times. You can't pledge 
yourself in two areas that are 
opposed at times. 
G: Do you think that there are 
enough minorities on the A.S.? 
D: I don't think the A.S. is repre-
sentative of what the school has. 
There is no doubt about that. 
G: Do you have any ideas for 
making it more representative? 
D: Having the government go 
out into these [ethnic] organiza-
tions, and endorsing them, and 
encouraging them to get involved 
in government. 
G: How about getting more 
minorities into the university as 
a whole? 
D: That's very important. The 
UC system has a problem with 
that all over. I think we would 
need to have a systemwide 
expansion project on that, and 
let the students know from all 
backgrounds that they would be 
welcome to the UC system. 
G: Do you think the administra-
tion is doing'enough to get more

minorities into the university? 
D: I think the administration is 
probably the cause ofthe limited 
number of minorities on cam-
pus, with increased fees , and 
without showing sponsorship for 
athletic programs. That's giving 
a message to a lot of students 
that the school doesn't really 
support the student popUlation 
or the student community. To 
compound that . . . with your 
ethnic origin or your money 
resources, that certainly isn't a 
very wekoming sign. 
G: What do you think can be 
done to change the administra-
tion? 
D: I would think we would need 
some sort of chanae in heads. 
Maybe some chancellors who 
are more or less interested in 
student activities, and not neces-
sarily in the life of the university. 
G: Would you support a drive to 
get Atkinson out of office? 
D: I wouldn't support a drive to 
get Atkinson out of office, I 
would support a drive to force 
Atkinson to become more aware 
of students, and if he's unable or 
unwilling to do that, then I can 
certainly see a drive would be 
necessary to alert the people. 
G: Do you endorse the football 
referendum? 
0: No, I don't endorse the refer-
endum. I do endorse football, 
and one of my goals is to estab-
lish a book co-op in which the 
revenues from that would be 
used to support the teams that 

we have. If we wee to vote for 
this referendum, then that would 
be supporting the administra-
tion's way of thinking at the 
moment, meaning 'Well,let'sjust 
have the students responsible for 
the funding.' I would love to see 
a football team on the campus ... 
football won't hurt anyone on 
campus.

Fourth, I feel that an intra-

Lastly, the loal of my team, 
Team Unity, is to unify the school 
through student government, 
meaning that we unify the four 
colleges. We need to have a posi-
tive flow of communication. We 
need to know these people, so we 
can interact with them socially, 
and on a business-like basis. 
G: What do you feel about the 
football referendum? 
P: I think it '5 Itrongest point i. 
that it offers five dollars to inter-
collegiate athletici ... intercolle-
giate athletics needs support, 
needs the money. 
G: What qualifies you for the job 
of A.S. president? 
P: Right now I serve u [A.S.) 

. Commissioner of Operations, 
Services, and Enterprises for this 

school, which means that I basi-
cally monitor the operations of 
. .. all the services and enter-
prises on campus. I think that 
this position has built up an 
effective line of communication 
between myself and the rest of 
the people involved not just in 
the A.S., but in its networks. 

Third College Sophomore 
Senator, that's what I was last 
year on A.S. I was an effective 
voice in Third College, I feel, 
because it made me more ethni-
cally aware. I'm not just a white 
boy that doesn't know what's 
going on. I undentand the needs 
of underprivileged students of 
color. Whether they be black, 
brown, or yellow, I know what 
they need and what they're going 
to be needing in the [next] few 
years. 

I basically say that through 
my experiences with the admi-
nistration ... [and] the students, 
the network that I've built up 
myself, and the network that I've 
built up through A.S. and stu-
dent councils, is what qualifies 
me for A.S. president next year. 

G: What make you more quali-
fied than your opponents? 
P: I feel that I am more qualified 
because I have this experience. 1 
know how bureaucracy works, 
and I know things should be 
changed. I understand what stu-
dents' needs are. I understand 
that certain students haven' been 
represented like they ought to be 
throuah the A.S. CounciJ.1 know 
what the needs of the students 
are from bein. exposed to them. 

My ideas are strong, and that's 
what makes me the most quali-
fied student. I'm not a flake . . . 
once I start a project, [finish it. I 
also don't promise things that 
aren't possible. 

G: An A. S. member recently said 
that the A.S. is too conservative 
and Greek-oriented. Do you 
think that's true, and if so, what 
do you think can be done to 
change that? 

P: I think that it has been possi-
bly a little conservative in the 
past. I happen to be in a frater-
nity, whetherthat's good or bad. 
I'm not a conservative guy ... I 
am by far one of the more liberal 
[Council members]. I think that 
the A.S. hasn't been as bad as a 
lot of people might think it has 
been. 
G: What do you feel is most 
wrong with the' A.S. this year? 

P: I feel that the A.S. has made 
some moves ... that should have 
been planned better. We should 
have been more in the public eye 
... so we're not looked on as this 
group of wanna-be elitists. 

G: How do you define the job of 
A.S. president? 

P: I define the job of A.S. presi-
dent as the leader of the council, 
the motivator, the starter of ideu 
. .. the supporter of ideas, 
becoming an effective means of 
communication between the stu-
dents, tbe administration, and 
the A.S. Council. [It must be] 
someone tbat has a past that 
shows that he can do the job 
effectively.

F: I have no idea, but I am pre-
pared. Life experience is how I 
figure this. 
G: Do you have any goals, if 
elected? 
F:I'd like my own parking space, 
if that's possible. Collect a cou-
ple of paychecks, that wouldn't 
be too bad. I already mentioned 
that I'd get the frat boys out of 
there, didn't I? 
G: Do you have a special anim-
osity towards 'frat boys'? 
F: Ah, just frat boys in general. I 
came to this school when there 
were no frats, the good old days.

Continued from pale 7 
It's not a hatred , or anything. 
Call it loathing. 
G: Are you ready to challenge 
the administration, if elected? 
F: Oh sure. Like volleyball, golf, 
football? 
G: What's wrong with the way 
things are being done now? 
F: We need a football team, and 
that's the only serious point I 
have. I wouldn't want to trivial-
ize that . That's the only serious 
issue I will address, the football 
team. Because we need it, I want 
it, I want to play. 
G: What recommends you over 
the serious c ndidat s fOI thl; 
position? 
F:I have no allegiances to anyb-
ody, so I wouldn't owe anybody 
any favors. There's not much to 
recommend me over anybody 
else; we could have more fun. 
The other guys are too serious. 

GEORGE REILLY 

Vice President 
Administrative 
Guardian: Let's start off by 

defining the job of the A.S. vice-
president, administrative. 
Reilly: BasicaJly, he serves as the 
right-hand man of the president. 
He also is in charge of running 
the council meetings ... and also 
appoints all the campus-wide 
representatives. It's a big job. 
He's basicaJly a big gopher, if 
you want to caJl it that. 
G: What goals do you have if 
elected? 
R: One of the things I want to 
bring out in my campaign is the 
deficiency of lighting in certain 
parts of the campus, specifically 
the Central Library 'forest ,' 
where there's been several as-
saults over the past few years. 

Another thing I want to bring 
out in my campaign is the park-
ing shuttle. I think it's a great 
idea, and I think we can make it 
better [by extend i ng the service). 

The last thing I want to bring 
out in my campaign is account-
ability of A.S. finances . Every 
week the A.S. spends part of its 
million-dollar plus budget ... 
and nobody ever knows about it. 
Why not publish in your paper 
. .. the organizations receiving 
the amounts, and the purposes? 
It 's kind offunny that that really 
is the student's money but they 

don't know where it's being spent. 
G: What are your qualifications 
for the job? 
R: I've been the representative 
for A.S. for the National Issues 
Forum and the Speaker's Forum 
for the last year, and I've worked 
cll' ely with the A.S. vice-pre-
sident administrative; I know him 
weJl , Dave Manheim. I've spent 
a lot of time at the office, I've 
spent a lot of time at the meet-
ings; I think I could do a good 
job. 
G: How are you more qualified 
than your opponents for this 
job? 
R: That's a good question. I can't 
say that I'm more qualified than 
him. He has more experience 
than I do . Al1 J can offer are my 
ideas, and what I want to get 
done. In a way it could be advan-
tageous to the st udents to [elect] 
someone who hasn't been in A.S. 
for such a long time, because I 
think an infusion of new thoughts 
is what is needed . 
G: Recently, an A.S. member 
complained that the A.S. is too 
conservative, as well as too 
Greek-oriented. Do you feel 
that's true, and if so, what can be 
done to counter that? Not only 
that, but what can be done to 

bring more minorities into the 
A.S.? 
R: I think there should be more 
diversity in the A.S. I think ifthis 
school became more concerned 
with the general goings-on of 
A.S., it would naturally follow 
suit that we'd have greater diver-
sity of people . They [Greeks] 
have access, and the other stu-
dents do not . It's just that we 
need to do something about the 
apathy that exists in this school. 
G: What do you think can be 
done? 
R: What I want to do is publish 
the goings-on in A.S. That could 
just be a spark, a catalyst, for 
other things. It seems to me that 
the A.S. ill ~n",ewhllt aloof from 
the student body. 
G: Out of the few referendum 
issues, the one that's probably 
received the most attention is the 
one for football. What's your 
opinion abollt that issue? 
R: I don't know enough about it 
to have an honest opinion. I 
would like to see another way to 
have football at this school 
without raising fees. I find it 
interesting that out of the $1 5 per 
quarter raise, $10 of that will go 
to football, and only $5 will got 
to other sports.

G: Would you be uncomfortable 
or unwilling to challenge the 
administration on an issue? 
R: I'd let them know about it. I 
wouldn't antagonize them, but 
I'd do it in an eloquent way. I 
wouldn't be afraid to challenge 
an issue, or question it. Theoreti-
cally, the A.S. has the power to 
do that. 
GO: Do you think the A.S. has 
been doing that enough? 
R: I think they've made an effort. 
G: Why are you running for the 
job? 
R: 1 just see some things that I'd 
like to change, and out of sheer 
frustration I guess I'm running, 
because I'd like to see some things 
donc, to get the: ~tuUc:nls more 
involved, and get students more 
involved in A.S. 

JOHN ROBISON 

Vice Prelident 
Administrative 
Guardian: Why don't you tell us 
why you're running for the job? 
Robison: I've worked closely with 
[current V.P . Administrative] 
Dave Manheim, and I've seen 
what he does, and I've been on 
the rules committee for a few 
years. That's my area of interest, 
the legislative, administrative 
aspect of A.S . I feel like I've 
proven myself in it, and I know 
what I'm in for, and I think I 
could do a good job at it. 
G: What are your qualifications? 
R: ['m very familiar with Robert's 
Rules of Order, parliamentary 
procedure, and [have confidence 
running the meetings because 
I've done it successfully before. 
G: Do you feel that there's too 
great a proportion of Greeks in 
the A.S., and! or that it's too 
conservative? 
R: [ think it's kind of a catch. It 
seems that on this campw the 
people that want to be involved, 
tend to lean towards the Greek 
system, because there's really 
not that much else, and they're 
not always made aware of tbe 
A.S. aspect. I would like to see 
more . .. diverse interests on the

council. I think this year's coun-
cil, especially, hal been your typ-
ically WASP council on a lot of 
leaislation, and I disa,ree with a 
lot of the stuff that has been 
done. This i. partly because of 
the Potluck [slate] last year, 
where they just filled everything 
and brou,ht them all on. I think 
a lot of people didn't know what 
they were doin" and I think it's 
been evident. A c1aslic example 
il the [alternative] media. 
G: What would you do about the 
alternative media? 
R: I think that they're hhe N,w 
IndtcQlorJ very cooperative as 
long as they're not getting 
screwed over. This year ... com-
munication is not as smooth as it 
could have been; a little more 
communication and everyone 
could "ave been happy. The 
upsetting things that have hap-
pened are the things that have 
been railroaded through, the 
things that people don't know 
about. [ would consider part of 
my job staying on top of people 
and making sure they know 
what's going on. 
G: Do you think the administra-
tion deals fairly with the students 
and the A.S., that it's on the 
level? 
R: On the level, no. A lot of 
things happen during the sum-
mer. You definitely have to know 
what's going on, and stay on top 
of things. 
G: Do you have any particular 
goals? 
R: The goals for the position are 
pretty much to stay on top of 
things. A personal goal of mine 
. .. is to secure an FM license for 
KSDT. I'd much rather see the 
KSDT studios , .. available for 
the students, as opposed to the 
comm. department. 
G: How do you feel about the 
football referendum? 
R: If the students are willing to 
pay the fifteen dollars a quarter, 
then I think it's a good thing, but 
it's pretty much up to the stu-
dents. But I see nothing but good 

coming from it. 
G: How do you feel you're more 
qualified than the other candi-
dates? 
R: I've had the opportunity to 
talk to Geor,e Reilly, and I 
noticed a lot of his points have 
already been done, or are infeas-
ible. And I don't know that he 
has enou,h A.S. experience to 
carry a meetin,. 
G: Do you think that the A.S. 
actually has any power? 
R: Well, technically, we're under 
the administration -[VICe Chance).. 
lor] Joe Watson can red-stamp 
anythin, we do. So, maybe I 
would say that we have allowed 
power. I think we have much 
more power with petitions behind 
us, some student support. 

Vice President 
External 

VAUGHN "TINY" REX 

Vice President 
External 

Guardian: Why are you running 
for office? 
RelI: Initially, my first [reason] 
was to pump some new blood 
into the A.S., in order to get a 
different perspective that in the 
past hasn't been there. Our SAFE 
slate, Students Active For Enric-
hment, is dealing with incorpo-
rating traditional philosophies, 
meaning white philosophies, with 
non-traditional philosophies, 
ethnic, in order to make a diverse 
experience for students at UCSD. 
In the past I don't think that has 
been the case. There hasn't been 
that type of representation across 
the board. 
G: Why not? 
R: Largely because the people 
who were in office priur were not 
sensitive enough to realize the 
issues. In a sense they were com-
ing from what they knew, which 
were their own experiences, so I 
don't hold that against them. 
G: What do you think can be 
done to bring in more ethnic

aroups into what's currently vir-
tually an all-white A.S.? 
R: More or lesl, it deal. with 
havin, a type of identification 
with particular illues that are 
bein, addressed. If people feela. 
thou,h you're meetin, their 
needs and their concerns, then 
they're [more inclined] to be a 
part; if they feel al thouah you're 
making an effort to incorporate 
them within the system, it's more 
likely they're goina to participate. 
G: What are your goall, if elected? 
R: If elected, my primary goal 
would be to establish some type 
of program that deals with land-
lord and tenant grievances. As 
V.P. of External Affairs thltt's 
one of my primary goals, in addi-
tion to building up student par-
ticipation in leadership positions. 

G: Do you think that the A.S. 
has power? [f you get your stu-
dent leaders in there, would they 
be able to do anything? 
R: I would like to think so. It all 
[depend.] on whether the issues 
are there, whether there's sup-
port for the issues, and whether 
people are really concerned 
enough to participate in what's 
going on. 
G: If elected, are you willing to 
challenge the administration on 
a particular iss ue? 
R: Definitely. ['m willing to chal-
lenge the administration if not 
elected. I don't think you have to 
be an elected official in order to 
challenge the adminstration. 
G: What do you think of the role 
fraternities and sororities have 
played in the A.S.? 
R: I think the role has been very 
useful, if you ask me. It's like a 
game; they've been able to build, 
in the past, a lot of power, they've 
been able to mobilize and organ-
ize themselves very fast . You 
can't hold it against them. It's all 
politics. They're only doing what 
you allow them to do. 
G: How do you define the job of 
V.P. of External Affairs? 
R: I look at it like 111 be the 
spokesperson that the commun-
ity will contact, in regards to 
UCSD or the A.S. 
G: Is there anythin, in the A.S.

you'd like to ace cbanpd, structur-
ally? 
R: I have enou,h experience to 
really say that initially I would 
like to have one particular thin, 
chan,ed. I think that I would 
like the philosophy to chan,e. 
Philosophically, just the whole 
approach in the r.st hasn't been 
representative of all students. 
Even if you can't identify with 
that particular group, if you can 
have the sensitivity to realize 
that they go here and they're 
attendinatheuniYmityand that their 
needs should be met. 
G: What qualifies you for the 
job? 
R: or the past two years I've 
been involved with SAAC, the 
Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee, as a research intern. 
SAAC has allowed me to get 
involved in A.S., and I've been 
appointed to several different 
positionl on A.S. [This expe-
rience] is causing me to say, 
'there are problems there', and I 
felt that somebody needed to 
address it, and that's why I 
decided to run for office. 
G: What makes you more quali-
fied than your opponent? 
R: I don't think 'Who's more 
qualified?' What sets me apart is 
my whole approach. With my 
different approach I chose to 
focus on different areas. 
G: Do you think UCSD's admin-
istrators are responsible for the 
low numbers of certain ethnic 
minorities that attend UCSD? 
R: No, I think society's respon-
sible . How can you say they're 
responsible because fewer [minor-
ities] are in college? I just think 
there needs to be more of a sensi-
tivity to realize the problem, and 
to reach out more to the com-
munity. 

MORDECAI POTASH 

Vice President 
Externa. 

Guardian: Why are you running 
for the position? 
Potash: I wanted to really con-
tinue the project that I had

started, and keep on gettin, stu-
dents involved in External. I 
thought that with the people, 
over the quarter-and-a-half I was 
V. P. Extema I, I.tarted to attract 
a core aroup of people, and we 
knew how to wa,k together. I 
wanted to keep on goin, with 
this core group of people, and 
that's why I wanted to run apin. 
G: Do you have any other goals, 
besides continuin, the projects 
you started this year? 
P: Well, I'd like to add upon 
them. With the La Jolla Town 
Council, we've gone to their 
meetings, but we haven't really 
participated in lheirevents. We're 
just starting to get involved [with 
them]. The A.S._oSAAC outreach 
program was started this year, 
and ['d like to expand that, and 
better coordinate it. 
G: Define the job of external 
affairs vice-president. 
P: The external affairs vice-
president represents the associ-
ated students to the community 
at large. The v.p. external affairs 
also keeps track of other UC 
campuses through the 'grape-
vine.' 
G: Do you think the fraternities 
and sororities have played too 
big a role in the way the A.S. has 
functioned in the last two ears. 
P: I've thought about that a lot, 
it's a big topic of conversation in 
the A.S. office. To me, I think it's 
kind of dangerous to say frater-
nities and sororities play too big 
of a role, because that's attach-
ing a label. I'm real wary of giv-
ing any group a label, persay. 
G: Are you in favor of having a 
football team on campus? 
P: If the students vote for it ... 
then 1'1 push for the referendum 
to go through. On election day, I 
think I'm probably goina to vote 
for it . Ijust think that it deserves 
a chance. 
G: What about the A.S. has dis-
appointed you the most this year? 
P: I think that what disappoints 
me most is that sometimes stu-
dents get involved in their own 
little squabbles; they really don't 
see the big picture. External has

I un nmning for A.S. President because I believe lIIal I 
have absolUlely no qualificatiOlll for the office. Regardless. I 
feel I can lead this school effectively. Some of the ideas my 
Liquor Cabinet IIld I have come up willi Ire: WaIking beer 
vendors on campus. A hard liquor license for lIIe Pub. and lIIe 
chauffered red wagon from FlIIlwy Isllllld for me. In addition. 
God will call me home if I don't win. So, on Voting Day. 
remember the All Night PIrty and that a vote fCoi Anthony 
Waldichuk is a vote for serious partying. 

Crowds debate Brother Jed in the plaza; I want to debate 
the AS media polici'es on the hump. We need a student govern-
ment ruled by public opinion, nOl an elite click. 

I want a student government that will go out of its way to 
inform the students of issues. We need people that will live their 
elected positions and work constantly. creativrly to improve 
campus life. 

UCSD needs someone to mobilize the student body power 
and make school what we. not the Regents, want. 

I Cllll make a difference. I will spend all next year working for 
the student body. 

The students of UCSD don't need another "RESPON-
smLE GOVERNMENT". We need one that will take a stand 
Ind fight for what all students attending a university require - a 
voice in theitown education. My nune is Maynlfd Dimmesda1e 
Ind I'm running for A.S. President I don't believe that everyone 
employed by the University must dedicate theit entite lives to 
further our education but this is more than a research institution 
or a paycheck supply! I will do everything possible to solve the 
needs and concerns of lIIe student by initiating an orgmized md 
productive channel between the A.S. Government and Admini-
stration. Furthermore, I will increase student activities through 
programming and funding. For a President that will represent

huge multi-purpose Intramurals Recreation Facility (similar to

I am Vaughn Terrell Rex and [ am running for the Vice 
Presidency of External Affaits. This is my forth year at UCSD 
I un a Third College senior majoring in Cornrnunicationa. The 
slate rm associated with is entitled SAFE. which stllll.ds for 
Students Active For Enrichment and our main objective is to 
educate the UCSD community by inter grating traditional IIId 
non-traditional perspectives. It is the philosophy of our slate 10 
promote a multi-cultural experience at the university in doing so, 
we may all benefit in the diversity at UCSD. As a candidate for 
lIIe External Affairs position my agenda consists of expanding 
established advocacy units which address community, city. and 
county issues, establishing a program to deal with landlord and 
tenant griev ances. increase student awareness and p .. ticipation 
with the University of California Student Association (UCSA) 
and the improvement of employer and employee relations. 
Please feel free to approach me and ta11t about concerns that Ire 
important to you because chances are mlny oilier students have 
the same concerns. 

External Affairs has ~n on the forefront of improving the 
quality of student life at UCSD this yur. 1 believe that our 
actions. not simply words, state this mosl clelrly. From AIDS 
Awareness Week, Complaint Booth. Voter Registration Drives, 
students involvement on the La Jolla Town Council. to ASI 
SAAC Outreach Progrun, IIld takin& ctive stances on Itudcnt 
employment rights; we have been one of the moat .ctive 
branches of the Auoc:iated Studenta. 

It haa been both III honor and a pleasure 10 supervise 
External Affairs thia year. The accomplishmenta that we have 
made haa brought me a lot of joy and feelinas of accomplish-
ment. If I am re-elecred I pomise one thina: the same activity 
and enthusiaarn that External Affain has diJplayed in the past 
will continue into the new year.

Former UCSD student Rursues his calling 

Documenting the faces of struggles 
By EVA WONG 
ArtsEtlltfN 

W hen Dan Martin grad-uated from UCSO in June of 1987, he not 
only had his B.A. in Communi-
cation, but he also had a VHS 
camera that communication pro-
fessor Dee Dee Halleck had lent 
him money to buy. Thatsummer, 
with camera in hand, Martin 
drove across the United States to 
New York. Along the way he 
shot documentary footage of 
public access stations, which he 
intended for airing on the Deep 
Dish Satellite Television Net-
work. His purpose for traveling 
to New York was to do research 
and work with Halleck for a 
week as a means "to try to pay 
her back." 

In addition, Martin said, "there 
was this great desire to get away 
after graduation and it seemed 
so justified with the camera. I 
[was] going to be productive and 
that was an important aspect, 
because even though it [the 
camera] was frustrating it was 
worth carrying . .. " 

After coming back from New 
York, Martin's next stop was 
Nicaragua. He said , "I took the 
bus all the way to Guatemala 
and then flew over [to Nicara-
gua]. I really got paranoid about 
my camera. I bought this really 
ugly suitcase to carry it around 
in and I'd lock it to myself. " He 
chose to go to Nicaragua in part 
due to influences from people 
like Halleck. 

Becuase he had seen so much 
of Nicaraguan video, he was 
interested in what it "was all 
about. " That was his main goal, 
but he also had "a sort offascina-
tion with the war," Martin said . 
"It's really disgusting to say that, 
... but I want[ed] to know first-
hand , something that wasn't 
censored." 

In Nicaragua, Martin shot 
footage of interviews with 
homosexuals. He said he was 
facilitating "this guy [he] met 
who was interested in video and 
was applying to the new Cuban 
international film and video 
school." According to Martin, it 
was a bad time to explore popu-
lar communication and the use 
of video in Nicaragua. Because 
of poor economy and the peace 
plan, "everyone's attention was 
on other things. I told this guy, 
'Come up with whatever you 
want to do, ' and that was what 
he wanted to do. I was basically 
his cameraman and technician." 

The video Martin filmed was 
primarily for the gay solidarity 
group that his friend was form-
ing during that time. "It was kind 
of under the table because they 
felt that there werejust too many 
problems in the country for them 
to press their issue. Yet, it [was] 
also time to organize around 
issues like AIDS and to educate 
each other," Martin said . . 

In shooting the footage, Mar-
tin said , "We went to this park 
that is known as the gay cruising 
park, but [which] is also the 
symbol of revolution. Many 
revolutionary heroes are buried 
[in the park]. There's this des-
troyed church ... It was des-
troyed during an earthquake and 

was never rebuilt. It's called the 
Revolutionary Plaza, and the 
church is this center for promis-
cuity." He adds, "I was very face-
tious because I interviewed with 
people sitting up on the altar of 
the destroyed church." 

The footage caused a stir 
among those in the solidarity 
group because two of its lesbian 
members, who are North Ameri-
can women, objected to the 
absence of lesbians in the tape. 

"They were all arguing and 
they were yelling at my poor 
friend - he was the youngest in 
the group - things like 'you 
didn't think of this.' They also 
were paranoid that I was going 
to take it back here [to America] 
to show it," said Martin, who 
thought the video was effective 
because it spurred dialogue 
among those in the group. 

According to Martin, the video 
has a lot of reactionary views 
because the people interviewed 
were mostly poor young males 
who felt left out of the war. 
"They are reactionary because 
before the revolution basically 
the police, the national guard, 
owned all the homosexual pros-

titution and they let the [people 
in] the park do anything they 
wanted. Now there's this attempt 
to destroy prostitution on the 
part of the government. " 

"There were varying degrees 
of reactionary elements as well 
as really beautiful accounts of 
how other gays had integrated. It 
was wild because all we were 
doing was walking around this 
park around dusk and interview-
ing people,» Martin continued. 

The copy of the footage Mar-
tin kept is now in New York 
being edited by a friend of Hal-
leck's. "What she's doind is that 
she's looking at it and trying to 
pick a piece to stand along that 
wouldn't endanger a person. We 
can't really trust anybody. What 
if it got back to Nicaragua? Sure, 
there are gay elements in the 
government, but I'm sure there's 
plenty of homophobia as well. 
We don't want to endanger 
anybody, but she wants to take a 
nice short little interview, and 
put it on Beep Dish's Central 
American project," Martin said . 

Manin first began working 
with video equipment late in his 
college career. "I didn't do any-
thing in terms of visual arts until 
my last year because J had this 
image that I wasn't capable. I 
was afraid of the technology. I'd 
see the visual arts students and 

sometimes I thought my outer 
appearances were 'too normal.' 
Levis and Penningtons just aren't 
doing anything anymore. I had 
this paranoia: since they looked 
'artistic' they must live it, and it 
must really be tl1em [coming 
through in their work]." 

Martm said he got over his 
fear and paranoia of using video 
as a medium by viewing the work 
of other visual arts students. "In 
my last year I started seeing stu-
dent videos and tl)ought they 
were horrible. Most .. of them I 
thought were really bad in that 

they were very shallow. There 
was no depth ... He also believed 
that "none of the stuff we shot 
[for San Diego Stew, a media 
production class] was really that 
good" either, "but all of it had 
depth to it. It had a lot of sincer-
ity and it was an attempt to show 
different people's point of view, 
rather than like these 'so called 
visual poems' that were about 
feeling alienated and were ego-
tistical [and not] reaching out to 
others ." 

Martin helped tape" An Inter-
national Fiction," a video made 
for Halleck's media production 

class. This production begins as 
a story about migrant workers 
but it actually ,deals more with 
borders between races in this 
country. Martin said, "It starts 
with migrants and goes to chica-
nos ... To me the video is aimed 
at me listening to them and 
learning from them about what 
they have to say. It is their voi-
ces, and at the same time [in the 
video] I always have to go back 
to the migrants because that is 
what got me interested." 

"I had lived in Mexico for a 

Upper I", tmd right: j :mMr

summer in a rural town and most 
of the people there were seasonal 
migrants to Texas. I developed 
some sort of sympathy with that 
and so the images of people wait-
ing at bus stops here in San 
Diego is always there for me. It 
was something I couldn't avoid, 
something that meant a lot to 
me. At the same time I was dat-
ing a woman who was of Latin 
origin and the border patrol 
would hassle her." 

Another reason Martin says 
the production centered around 
Mexican / American crossing 
points was because "at the time 

there was a photosrapher in the 
San Diego area who had done 
photo essays about people crosl-
ing. He was the rul motivator 
behind that [aspect ofthe video)." 

In discussinl hil actions dur-
ing his years at UCSO, Mar-
tin said, "When I was a student 
here, 1 was really cynical of any 
leftist activities on this campus, 
even though I consider myself 
radical in my mind. I never did 
anything with them because I 
was so critical. Rather than join-
ing them and trying to find 
commo~ clements, I was just off 

. to the side saying, 'You're doing 
that wrons,' which was so nar-
row and such a mistake. 

This caused Martin to miss 
out on a lot. But as a result of his 
introversion, he found video. 
"Video in a way has connected 
me to so many people. It con-
nected me beyond this school 
and that's what I liked. It brought 
me to the community and that's 
like'Wow, here I am a university 
student being a resource to the 
community.' Thllt'S what I feel 
the university should be about. It 
shouldn't internalize itself." 

Currently, Martin hopes to 
work for United Farm Workers 
(UFW) in the central valley. In 
doing so, he would be committed 
to the group for a minimum of 18 
months. Martin said this job 
with UFW, like his previousjo"s 
involving video, will not be for 
pay, although the UFW would 
pay his room and board. While 
all his peers are making money, 
Martin said he's practically beg-
ging people for money to get,to 
the places he wants to go. "Peo~ 
pIc have offered me normal jobs, 
but they're not the type of job 
that I want to be involved with." 
According to Martin, any stu-
dent of Halleck's could exploit 
the experience of having worked 
with her to get a good job, but 
that's not something he wants to 
do. 

To his understanding the job 
he would be doing with the UFW 
involves setting up a training 
workshop tor orsanizing pur-
poses, as well as educating the 
general public about the farm 
workers. Of the UFW, Martin 
said, "First they want to acquire 
equipment. Theyarestaningwith 
VHS and are tryins to get TV 
stations to donate their old 3/4 
inch stuff. 

"There are all kinds of possi-
bilities once the Union receives 
equipment. They could acquire a 
low transmitter and transmit 
throughout the central valley. "It 
would be like having their own 
kind of public access station," 
Martin said. 

In utilizing "video for organi-
zational purposes," such as with 
this job with the UFW, Martin 
sees himself being "used as a 
segue for people's learning 
processes," which is important 
to him because he believes in 
looking for "common threads" 
to bring people together.

Nuclear arms: IGCC member 
offers his perspective 
By ADAM LEVY 
St~Wrltn 

In 1984, Ronald Reagan 
unveiled his plans for a space-
based defense system that would 
save the world from the threat of 
nuclear war. Called the Strategic 
Defense Initiative (SOl), it trig-
sered heated debate across the 
globe. 

The main purpose of SOl is to 
create a shield in space, capable 
of rendering Inter-Continential 
Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) obso-
lete by destroying them with las-
ers in space. The system would 
be comprised of a diverse range 
of sophisticated, cutting-edge 
technology that includes satel-
lites, lasers, heat-activated sen-
sors and radar, and an excess of 
computer hardware and software 
responsible for coordinating the 
entire system. It would be 
deployed in three phases, and 

e~ch phase, conceivably, would 
act as a filter, effectively destroy-
ing all incoming missiles. 

The debate on·SOI has grown 
more salient in recent days with 
upcoming arms talks in June 
between Ronald Reagan and 
Mikhail Gorbachev that could 

produce a treaty involvins deep 
cuts in our nuclear arsenals. In a 
recent interview with Dr. G. Allen 
Greb, associate director of the 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation, he discussed some 
critical questions in regard to 
SOl and future arms agreements. 

A major problem with SOl, 
.:cording to Dr. Greb, is that it 

will inevitably violate the ABM 
Treaty. The ABM or Anti-bal-
listic missile treaty is an agree-
ment not to deploy or test wea-
pons' systems capable of knock-
ing out the other side's ICBMs. 
Those who favor deployment of 
SOl have argued for a broad 
interpretation of the treaty that 
would allow SOl testing. 

Or. Greb considered such an 
interpretation as harmful to 
future treaties. "If you're free to 
reinterpret treaties later on, ho w 
can you get the Congress to 
alree on what [future treaties] 
you're doing at that particular 
time?" he asked. 

"What the two sides have 
agreed to do right now," Dr. 
Greb pointed out, "is that they 
have agreed to disagree." Both 
sides should adhere to the strict 
interpretation ofthe ABM treaty; 

however, there is an escape clause 
which allows all tests that are 
deemed necessary. 

Dr. Greb expressed some con-
fidence that the two sides would 
eventulllJy come t~ an agreement 
on SOl that would set parame-
ters for research and testing . He _ 
also felt that some sort of an 
agreement would be necessary 
for a new arms treaty (S. T.A.R. T. 
treaty) with the Soviets. He 
furthermore pointed out that the 
ABM treaty is not in immediate 
danger. "The kinds of technolo-
gies discussed [and used in S01]," 
he said "ftc still pretty much far 
off . .. we have a 10 year period 
before any of this activity wiIJ 
even threaten the restrictive 
interpretation. " 

As far as the future of SOl, 
Dr. Greb noted that it was not a 
certainty that the President fol-
lowing Reagan would pursue the 
program with vigor. The next 
President might be much more 
willing to use it as a bargaining 
chip, if Reagan doesn't strike a 
deal involving SOl this June. 
One thing is clear, noted Dr. 
Greb, the idea of a defense against 
nuclear weapons is here to 
stay. (Q)

Football 
Continued from page 5 
support to other athletic sports. 
Paul belabored how lood the 
referendum would be for the ath· 
letes in sports other than foot-
ball, but that is a separate issue 
alt0ather from football. Why 
combine the two in one referen-
dum? Could it be that it was writ· 
ten with the intent to mingle the 
two issues to gain extra sup'port 
for football that would other-
wise fail on its own? I liken this 
tactic to a bill in the U.S. Con-
gress that would raise taxes to 
aid the poor, but also would help 
build more nuclear bombs. Let 
the issue of football stand on its 
own as a single and separate ref-
erendum, not as a sneaky rider. 

Paul also begs the question as 
to what possible trouble football 
could cause. How conveniently 
short one's memory can be when 
it suits them. I recall several TV 
and newspaper stories last year 
on trouble with football crowds 
at San Diego State - gate crash-
ing, arrests for rowdy behavior, 
el al. Docs Paul really think that 
because alcohol is not to be 
served there won't be "druken 
butts" at games? Fans get drunk 
before pmes and, as surely as 
the sun shines, they will sneak in 
their favorite beverage. 

Next is the point that propo-
nents make over and over again-
unified school spirit. Somehow, 
we are to equate football with 
unified school spirit. This is a 
little hard to believe. Historically 
attendance at collegiate sports at 
UCSD has not been a ICll-out 
occurence. This is not to belittle 
the dedicated effort of our ath-
letes, but rather a reflection of 
the philosophy of sports here at 
UCSD; students would rather 
participate than attend sports. 
Witness the hUle intramural 
sports prolram. I think you'll 
agree that students would prefer 
being "unified" as part of a team 
rather than as spectaton in a 
faceless crowd. And since at-
tendance is vital to a football 
program given ita costs, this one 
is surely doomed. 

Somehow I don't buy Paul 
Lanninl's soulful plea, like a TV 
evangelist, to bring the Word of 
Football to wllat he believes is a 
backwards campus starving for 
enlightenment.

Nowak (6-3) finished the game 
witha season-high IS strike outs . 

The Tritons (20-9) assaulted 
Whittier's pitchers (9- IS) in the 
second game with 19 hits. Catcher 
Jim Martinez led the barrage 
with two hits in three at-bats and

If Saturday night is any indi-
cation, the UCSD men's volley-
ball team should be primed and 
ready for the Southern Califor-
nia Volleyball Conference Champ-
ionships on April 22 and 23. In a 
well-matched and closely foulht 
contest between the UCSD Trit-
ons and the Chapman College 
Panthers, a sterling comeback 
by the Triton squad in game four 
allowed them to pull out a 16-14 
victory, winning the match three 
games to one. The victory im-
proves UCSD's record to a not-

.so-impressive 8-18 (1-3 in 
league), yet they have already 
secured themselves a position in 
the postseason tournament . 
Chapman's record falls to 10-9 

(2-2 in leaJUe). 
The Tritons be,an the contest 

as if they were going to storm out 
ahead and never look back, as 
they took a 3~ lead and eventu-
ally upped it to 7-2. But Chap-
man, a school that had defeated 
UCSD just two weeks before on 
their home court , was not to be 
easily disposed of. Led by fresh-
man Kurt Dumm, the Panthers 
rallied and came within one point 
of the Tritons late in the game at 
13-12. Nevertheless, the Tritons 
manaled to emerge victorious in 
the initial lame, when UCSD's 
Paul Miller blocked a slam to 
seal the victory at 15-13. 

"We could've played a lot bet-
ter," Triton sophomore swinl 
hitter John Lim mentioned, ref-
errin, to the entire contest in 

leneral. Perhaps the team could 
have played better on the whole, 
but Lim could not have played 
much better in game two. Lim 
led both clubs with 20 kills on the 
evening, contributinl the bulk of 
them in the second game at the 
expense of the virtually helpless 
Panthers. Althoulh Miller also 
put forth a 100d effort in game 
two, Lim's devastating slams 
almost sin,le-handedly carried 
the Tritons to a 15-9 victory. The 
six point differential in the final 
score turned out to be the largest 
margin of victory between the 
two teams for the entire match. 

With a 2~ lead in sets, the 
situation appeared rosy for 
UCSD. But Chapman was not 
finished with them just yet. As a

Sports commentary: The football/acts 
B,JONATHAN SCHRETER 
sport. EdltOf' 

On Tuesday and Wednesday (Apr. 12 
and 13), the student body of UC San 
Die,o will be alked to vote on an Inter-
coUeJiate uPlrade and footbaU referen-
dum. Since the first day, the question 
hu been plalued by milinformation 
(for example, the Los Angeles nmes. 
San DielO County Edition, Apr. S, 
1988). Because ofthis milinf ormation, a 
couple of misconceptions have arisen. 
The followin, facts should clear these 
misunderstandinp in an effort to prove 
that the athletics of UC San DielO need 
the passaae of this referendum. 

One of the primary concerns opposi-
tion to the referend urn hu is the distrult 
in the administration's distribution of 
the proposed SIS/quarter increase in 
"student activity fees." However, allo-
cation of fees is set by the referendum. It 
clearly states that a maximum of S 10 
will be used in the "establishment and 
operation of footbaU" while the re-
mainder will be used to provide addi-
tional financial support to existinl 
intercolleliate athletic teams. 

It is the understandinl of the athletic 
department that the vote of the student 
body must be upheld. Therefore, should 
the referendum pass, the department 
will be bound to the liven distribution 
requirements. 

In their research efforts to ,ive 
ASUCSD the estimatien as to what 
would be necessary to institute a foot-
ball program, the athletic department 
used information from other Division 
III schools for sample bud,ets and 
arrived at the SIO amount as necessary 
to adequately fund the program. 

.. It is our hope that, in time, the SIO 
goin, towards football will be r~duced, 
allowin, more money to ,0 to the other 
intercollegiate teams," said UCSD 
Athletic Director Judy Sweet. 

Right now, the 22 varsity intercolle-
liate teams and seven intercollegiate 
clubs are operating on a budget of under 
S I SO,OOO. The up,rade ofthese funds by 
even SS will lilnificantly improve all 
budaets, includinl the club sports. 
"Club sports that faU under intercolle-
giate athletics will benefit from the ref-
erendum as well," Sweet sa' d. 

"UCSD is unique in that even the 
clubs get lome support from the Athletic 
Department. Passale ofthe referendum 
would li.nificantly increase what those 
clubs receive already." 

If the referendum passes, the athletic 
department still does not have final say 
over the allocation of funds. The Inter-
colleliate and Recreation Advisory 
Committee (IRAq consistinl of both 
athletes and coaches, will act in an advi-
sory position to insure that funds are 
disbursed fairly to all 22 teams. 

"Our intentions are to meet with the 
coaches and players on their priorities. 
As teams differ in size and equipment 
needs, IRAC will ultimately decide the 
amounts each team will receive," Sweet 
said. 

"The philosophy of the athletic 
department is one of equitable support 
for all pro,rams. We don't feel it is 
necessary to sacrifice the bud lets of our 
existinl prolrams in our effort to insti-
tute football. We are equally supportive 
of allaports. " 

The second concern opposition to the 
referendum has is that the addition of a

football team will disrupt the academic 
standards of UCSD. However, there are 
several examples of universities and col-
le,es where athletics and academici 
have co-existed with the same commit-
tment towards excellence, most notably 
Stanford and all of the Ivy Lealue 
schools. As for Division III examples, 
Case Western and University of Chi-
calo not only have managed to main-
tain an excellent academic reputation 
but have had successful athletic pro-
grams as well. 

"It is important to realize that we are 
still dealina with Division III stand-
ards," said Assistant Athletic Dire-ctor 
Earl Edwards. 

"The reputation that most students 
believe football creates in a university 
typically comes from Division I schools. 
In Division III, we are not dealin, with 
scholarships. Nor will the admissions 
standards of UCSD be lowered with the 
addition of football," Edwards said . 

The athletic department has recently 
completed a study which indicates the 
average G.P.A. of the intercollegiate 
athlete is hilherthan theaverale G.P.A. 
of the student body at larle. 
"We don't intend to see that standard 
lowered just because we have football at 
UCSD," Edwards said . 

Interestingly, although a supposed 
debate over the referendum exists, the 
intramurai directors, all four college 
counsels, and the 400+ intercollegiate 
athletes are in support of the referen-
dum, according to Cris Rys, Warren 
Junior Senator and student-initiator 
behind the referendum. 

Now that (hopefully) the misconcep-
tions that have appeared with the refer-
endum have been cleared up, there are a 

couple of positive influences that need 
to be mentioned. 

First, the referendum declares that 
"all UCSD undergraduate students 
would be admitted free of charae to all 
future relular season intercollegiate 
home e'vents, including home football 
,.mes." Should the referendum pass, 
the athletic department would not have 
the liberty of changinl this policy. 
Besides, studies have shown that stu- ~ 
dent attendance is much Jre&ter without 
an admissions fee, a factor that both the 
athletic department and the teams would 
like to ICC. 

As dollars allow, improvements would 
be made to existinl athletic facilities 
that could benefit the entire school. For 
example, a new wei,ht-trainin, center 
that would be necessary for a football 
team would have to be built. 

Finally, although you may still have 
some doubts, the most important action 
you, as a student of UCSD, can take is 
to simply vote. Last year's referendum, 
which proposed a S6.S0 increase in fees 
for only the addition of footb.tll, did 
pass but because not enough students 
voted, it could not be put into effect. 

The vote ·of seniors is just as impor-
tant as the rest ofthe undergraduates. A 
passage of the IntercoUegiate Upgrade 
referendum will allow for an improve-
ment of the total athletic program, 
which includes alumni activities (such 
as Homecomings) that could not exist 
without it. 

.. As this is a student-initiated referen-
dum, [the athletic department] is re-
sponding to the student's needs and 
desires," Edwards said. The students 
now have an opportunity to support 
those desires. lID

the job? 
Judaken: The programming com-
missioner is the person responsi-
ble for taking care of most of the 
events on campus, so you've got 
to be able to coordinate the dif-
ferent events. 
G: What is your largest criticism 
of the way things are now? 
J: I believe that programming is 
the only position that has a real 
opportunity to influence the 
social life on this campus and I 
don't see that being done now. 
G: How do you intend to change 
these things and make improve-
ments? 
J: The events that have worked 
are going to be continued, except 
with a slightly different emphasis 
and more often. I'd like to make 
sure that there is a T.G. every 
week and also that there is at 
least one big band at a T.G. each 
quarter. I'm going to try to 
initiate a "Winter Festival for 
Peace," bring back the noon-
time concerts and have a battle 
of the bands where other cam-
puses are eligible, with UCSD as 
a focus for community events. 
Basically, UCSD is too much of 
a learning institution and not 
enough of a university. 
G: How are you more qualified 
than your opponents? 
J: I'm not sure the extent of lar-
ry's experience, but I know it's a 
lot to do with KSDT. Basically, 
what I've done is hardcore pro-
gramming as assistant Pub pro-
grammer, and also the assistant 
Warren programmer. I've worked 

r 

through the bureaucracy to put 
on the events. I know what it 
takes. There are several places 
on this campus where program-
ming takes place, and I'd say to 
a large extent I've worked with 
them all . 
G: Are you in a fraternity? 
J: No, I'm not. 
G: Do you feel that the A.S. is 
dominated by Greek members? 
J: Right now the programming is 
pretty "mainstream." There is a 
bit of problem with that , but in a 
sense it'sjustified because they're 
the people who have turned out 
and voted. I don't think that fra-
ternities should be the only vehi-
cle for getting a social life on this 
campus. 
G: Do you think that the alcohol 
policy has any effect on the unity 
of the campus? 
J: I feel that this campus is our 
community. There is no real 
harm in terms of damaging the 
campus. I would advocate that 
the alcohol policy be changed , 
but I see myself working around 
it. 
G: Would you be uncomfortable 
with radically challenging the 
administration? 
J: Absolutely not. The students 
here represent a large segment of 
this community and we have to 
have some say in terms of what 
happens in the community. I 
think that the kinds of things 
that affect us as students we 
should have a greater say in. 
G: How much time are going to 
be able to devote to this job? 
J: I will do everything that it 
takes to get the job done. I know 
that this is a vastly wider scope of 
events than have been attempted 

in the past so I'm going to co-
sponsor a lot of events with a lot 
of other organizations, and estab-
lish a committee of appointed 
position that can deal with dele-
gated responsibilities. 

MARK MOORADIAN 

Pro .... mmlDI 
Gu.rdl.n: How would you 
define the job? 
Moor.dlan: I think you're in 
charge of organizing the main 
events: film series, T.G.s, Pub 
events, hopefully more I.rger-
scale concerts. 
G: What is you largest criticism 
of the way things are now? 
M: It just seems that T.Go's are 
the biggest things now and there 
could be more. All the program-
ming here is pretty good but I'd 
like to see a little more activity 
on campus. 
G: How do you intend to change 
these things? 
M: I'd like to see more bands at 
the Pub on week nights in addi-
tion to weekends, hopefully more 
T.G.·s and more larger concerts 
like the Reggae Fest. 
G: How are you more qualified 
than your opponents? 
M: I haven't had a lot of public 
relations experience but I know 
a lot about bands in general and 
I have experience with bands in 
L.A. 
G: Are you in a fraternity? 
M:No. 
G: Do you feel that the A.S is 
dominated by Greek members? 
M: Not necessarily. I think that's 
a major support group for peo-
ple that are running. 

G: Do you think that the alcohol 
policy has any effect on tile unity 
of the campus? 
M: To an extent, yes. I will be 
working for reversing the spon-
sorship limitations. Those are 
the best things this campus has 
going for it as far as constantly 
scheduled social events. 
G: Would you be uncomfortable 
with radically challenging the 
administration? 
M: No. I'm different than most 
ofthe people I've met in the A.S. 
I don't have a lot of student 
government experience, so what 
I want to get done, I really want 
to get done. 
G: How much time are you going 
to be able to devote to this job? 
M: I don't intend to slack off. If I 
slack off, you're sacrificing a lot 
of things for everyone else. 

LARRY WEINTRAUB 

PrOarammiDI 

G ....... : How would you define 
the job? 
Weintraub: Providing entertain-
ment: concerts, movies, speak-
ers, theatre, possible noon-time 
concerts and the T.G.s. All the 
things that I'm really interested 
in. 
G: What is your major criticism 
of things now? 
W: My main concern is the T .G.s. 
This year we never known when 
they are, and the bands and! or 
music have been very poor. 
G: What do you intend to do to 
make improvements? 
W: I'd like to see some of the 
bigger concerts here on campus. 

The T.G.s will be expected every 
other week as well as a lot of 
better bands to bring people out, 
not just to drink but also for the 
musIc. 
G: How are you more qualified 
than your opponent? 
W: I've worked with University 
POP events which gives me a lot 
of ties with concert promoters, 
learning how to put on bil 
events. At the GuardiD" I've lot-
ten to meet a lot of contacts with 
record companies and promo-
ters. At KSDT I have a lot of 
experience putting things 
together, workinl with people. 
G: Are you in a fraternity? 
W: Yes. I am a foundinl father 
oftbe Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter. 
G: Do you feel that the A.S. is 

dominated by Greek members? 
W: There is a signiftcant frater-
nity influence on the A.S. but I 
would not say that other people 
are not represented because I 
have not seen a whole lot of 
favoritism. 
G: Do you think that the alcohol 
policy has anythinl to do witb 
the lack of unity on campus? 
W: I'm not a big fan of the alco-
hol policy. It's very restrictive. It 
drives students off campus and 
you're going to lose the unity. 
G: Would you feel uncomforta-
ble with radically challenging the 
administration? 
W: If there was opportunity to 
have the power to say some-
thing, I would be there. 
G: How much time are you loinl 
to put into this job? 
W: For this job, everything else 
I'm involved in will take back 
seat.

matter offact, the Panthers were 
nowhere near taken care of. 
Althoulh the Tritons temporar-
ily held a 6-4 lead in what could 
have been the final pme of the 
matc:h, Chapman, behind the 
powerful right hand of senior 
Erich Schlitz, bounded ahead 
10-6, increased the lead to 12-7, 
and finally won it by a IS-IO 
score. The pme featured an 
incredible divin, save into tbe 
bleacbers in front of tbe UCSD 
Pep Band by Scblitz. Unfortu-
nately for the Tritons, however, 
the Panthers appeared to be get-
tin, stronaer al the pme wore 
on. 

This seemed very much the 
case al the fourth and final pme 
pro8fClled, for after UCSD took 
a 7-S lead. the Panthers overtook 
the Tritons and put them in a 
deep hole wben they boasted a 
14-9 lead. At tbis point, the Trit-
ons came toaether and performed 
a ItunDin, comeback, putting 
the next seven points of tbe .. me 
on tbe board to win the .. me 
16-4 and the matcb 3-1. 

It took .n incredible team 
effort and lome luck in the late 
goinl for tbe Tritons to pull this 
one out. Although Miller's block 
of an attempted Ilam by Schiltz 
may have been the most crucial 
single contribution by a UCSD 
individual during the comeback, 
it was the net which deserves a 
Ireat deal of credit in the Triton 
victory. The net, believe it or not, 
saved many a ball which other-
wise would have fallen to the 
floor and given the victory in 
game four to the Panthers. 

"Hopefully this game will be a 
sparkplug for the future," Triton 
head coach Oigger Graybill said 
after the game. "I think that now 
that Mike has taken over as our 
setter, he may be able to lead us 
to the championship." 

Graybill was spealtin, of Mike 
Badt, who bas only recently taken 
over as the Triton setter due to 
injuries to the regular sellers . 
Saturday ni,hl, Badt led both 
squads with S6 sets, 1 S sets more 
than Chapman's seller Chuck 
Cutnese.
