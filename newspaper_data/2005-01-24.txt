Connerly ends regent term 
Figure worked to ban affinnative action 
By BENJAMIN BAITLETT 

Staff Writer 
Ward Connerly, the highly 

controversial figure who earned a 
national reputation after leading 
the successful charge to dismantle 
affinnative action in California, 
attended his last official meeting 
in his 12-year tenure as a UC 
regent on Jan. 20. 

Connerly's stance against race-
based admissions turned him into 
one of the most widely !mown and 
divisive figures in California, 
called an upstanding hero by sup-
porters and an "Uncle Tom" by 
critics. 

"He is a very principled, ethi-
cal person and I'm proud to know 
him," said attorney Sharon 
Browne of the Pacific Legal 
Foundation, which supported 
Connerly's efforts to ban racial 
preferences. "I'm sure he'll be 
missed." 

His critics, however, disagree. 
"Connerly has turned UC into 

a backwater of segregation," said 
Yvette Fela rca , spokeswoman for 
By Any Means Necessary, a pro-
affirmative action group critical of 
Connerly. "Frankly, we are happy 
to see him go." 

The charged debate began 

shortly after former Republican 
G<>v. Pete Wilson appointed 
Connerly to the UC Board of 
Regents in 1993. Connerly, who 
describes himself as Iri~h , Native 
American and black, took on the 
issue of race, proposing that affir-
mative a..:tion be eliminated from 
UC adlnission policies. 

In July 1995, after a 13-hour 
session interrupted by a bomb 
threat and punctuated by protest-
ers led by Rev. Jesse Jackson, the 
regents voted 14- 10 in favor of 
Connerly's proposal, eliminating 
the consideration of race from UC 
adrni sions. 

A year later, Connerly went on 
to co-author and champion 
Proposition 209, which prohibited 
consideration of race in all of 
California's public employment, 
education and contracting. 

"He is a courageous person for 
tackling this issue," Browne said. 
"The government should be treat-
ing everybody equally, without 
regard to race or sex. He has made 
California a better place for every-
body and improved how govern-
ment and education are run ." 

Opponents of the proposition, 
however, have argued that racial 
consideration is necessa ry for 
minorities to overcome societal 

obstacles. 
"We don't live in a color-blind 

society," said Tammeil Gilkerson, 
program director at the 
Greenlining Institute, a liberal 
think tank that has been critical of 
the university's diversity policies. 
"There is racism entrenched in 
the system. At UCSD, for exam-
ple, only 24 African-American 
males were adlnitted in fall of 
2004. '" That doesn 't reflect the 
diversity of California." 

Connerly's opponents have 
also charged that hi efforts 
against affinnative action were a 
premeditated political maneuver 
endorsed by Wilson. 

"If you !mow anything about 
the right wing, they are smart and 
deliberate," Gilkerson said. "An 
obscure businessman who hap-
pens to be black gets appointed as 
a regent .... It's putting a black face 
on a white policy. I don't think 
that it was a coincidence." 

Connerly and his upporters 
have always denied this charge. 

"I think the 'Uncle Tom' 
remarks deeply affected him," UC 
Students Association President 
Jennifer Lilla said. "I've been at 
meetings where he went into the

Student regents visit campus

Senior Staff Writer 

Student Regent Jodi Anderson 
and Student Regent-designate 
Adam Rosenthal answered student 
questions and responded to con-
cerns during aJan. 21 campus visit 
toUCSD. 

A graduate student at UCLA, 
Anderson represents the approxi-
mately 200,000 students in the 
UC system as the sole student 
with voting powers on the UC 
Board of Regents. 

"We can do a better job as a 
board of educating ourselves on 
the student perspective, but we are 
working on it," Anderson said. 
"And the student regent tries to 
bring [students1 concerns to the 
Board of Regents." 

The student regent is appoint-
ed annually through a written 
application and several interviews 
with members of the UC Students 
Association and Board of Regents. 
Once appointed, the student 
serves one year as a regent-desig-
nate, who sits on committees but 
has no vote, followed by one year 
as the voting regent. 

Anderson currently votes on 
the 26-member board and deals 
with a wide range of issues affect-
ing the 10 campuses. 

"We are in a precarious situa-
tion with an increase in fees and a 
reduced return to aid," Anderson 

SIudent viIws: Student Regent-designate Adam Rosenthal (right) speaks with 
A.S. President Jenn Pae (left) and other A.S. officials at a Jan. 21 campus visit 
said. "This is the wrong message 
to send, and it has a negative 
impact on students. It takes us one 
more step away from accessibility 
to low-income students. While 
one year won't make or break a 
student's ability to pay, I'm wor-
ried that it is the beginning of a 
trend." 

Anderson was instrumental in 
crafting the regent-approved reso-
lution making outreach programs 
a funding priority for the 
University of California in order 
to "give more leverage in future 
fights," she aid. 

Sinh College Senior Senator 

Matt Corrales said he was con-
cerned that only one student 
receives a vote on the Board of 
Regents, but commended 
Anderson and Rosenthal. 

"There is a lack of accountabil-
ity [for the Board of Regents) and 
there should be more voting stu-
dent regents," Corrales said. "But 
they are doing a great job repre-
senting student concerns, and I 
appreciate their support for stu-
dent-initiated outreach.' 

Rosenthal, next year's student 
regent, said he sees the need for a

uc, CSU looking to start joint file-sharing service 
By MADEUNE'PHILUPS 

Contributing Writer 
Due to a high volume of illegal 

file-sharing among students, the 
University of California and the 
California State University systems 
have jointly asked companies to bid 
on a contract to provide online 
music access to students. The two 
universities view a legal download-
ing program as a chance to furtller 
deter students from engaging in 
illegal activity, according to UC 
Office of the President spokes-
woman Abby Lunardini. 

"File-sharing notices are defi-

nitely trending upward," Lunardini 
said. "A lot of colleges across the 
country are facing increasing pres-
ure to stop illegal downloading .... 

[A lega l ervice) would be one more 
tool in the arsena I. " 

T he two systems hope to hear 
back from vendors, such as 

apster, by spring, allowing the 
campuses that choose to take 
advantage of the service to do so 
beginn ing in the fall quarter, 
according to Lunardini .

I BRIEFLY 
Full Senate confirms 
Spellings nomination 

The u.s. Senate approved President George 
W. Bush's nomination of Margaret Spellings to 
head the federal Department of Education by a 
vOice vote on Jan. 20. 

Spellings, a longtime adviser to Bush and 
one of the head shapers of the No Child Left 
Behind Act, will replace outgoing Education 
Secretary Rod Paige. 

At the hearing, Spellings said the presidents 
second-term agenda would include additional 
state testing for high school students, higher 
academic standards for vocational programs 
and a revamping of federal financial aid to help 
nontradi tional students, according to the 
American Council on Education. 

Spellings will be the second woman to head 
the Education Department in its 26-year histo-
ry. President Jimmy Carter appointed Shirley M. 
Hufstedler as the first woman to take the office 
In 19BO. 

State PIRGs opposes Bush's 
Pell Grant proposal 

State Public Interest Research Groups - a 
national organization representing individual 
public Interest groups in each state - has criti-
cized President George W. Bush's proposal to 
increase the maximum Pe ll Grant award by 2.5 
percent in each of the next five years. 

The move would fail to keep pace with infla-
tion over that period, the group stated in a 
press announcement. 

After including projected tuition increases, 
the plan would reduce the percentage of 
tuition and fees that the maximum Pell Grant 
covers, from 79 percent to 54 percent, over the 
five-yea r period, it stated. 

"Nearly half a million qualified high school 
students fo rego college each year because of 
the cost, and millions more take on huge 
amounts of debt to pursue higher education," 
State PIRGs' higher-education advocate Kate 
Rube stated. "Rather than turning the tide, the 
president's proposal keeps us on the same 
downhill path:' 

The organization has called on Congress to 
increase the maximum award by $450 this 
year, to $4,500. 

UCSD ranks 13th in world 
in new academic listing 
A worldwide academic index of 500 univer-

sities, released by the Institute of Higher 
Education at Shanghai Jiao Tong 'University in 
China, has ranked UCSD as 13th in the world. 

The ranking weighed academic and 
research performance, including the number of 
prestigious awards won by faculty and alumn i, 
published citations and student performance. 

The campus received its highest ranking for 
the number of citations regarding research con-
ducted by faculty members on two science and 
social science indices, and its lowest score in 
the category for alumni achievement. 

UC Berkeley was the only UC campus 
ranked higher, coming in at fourth in the world. 
Harvard, Stanford and Cambridge took the top 
three spots, respectively. 

UCLA trailed UCSD as number 16. 
A separate list of global rankings published 

by The London Times Higher Education 
Supplement in November placed UCSD in 
24th place, two ahead of UCLA. 

The Berkeley campus came in as number 
two in that index, trailing Harvard. 

Rady School begins new 
bUilding construction 

The Rady School of Management has bro-
ken ground on the school's initial building. the 
first at UCSD to be funded exclusively by pri-
vate donations. 

"The Rady School is a welcome add ition to 
the UCSD campus and we are excited to be 
breaking ground on this building just four 
months after admitting the first class of ". stu-
dents: Chancellor Mart,e Anne Fox said. "The 
Rady School facility Will provide cutting-edge 
technology, giving students the tools they need 
to become leaders in the life sciences and 
technology sectors:' 

Established in 2001, the school will serve 
business students interested in the fields of sci-
ence, technology and life sciences. 

The new facility, expected to open in 2006, 
will contain approximately 50,000 assignable 
square fee~ including classrooms, conference 
rooms and common areas. 

Researchers find way to 
transform stem cens 

Three UCSD bioengineers have invented a 
process to transform embryonic stem cells into 
other specialized cells that they believe could 
someday provide treatments for dozens of dis-
eases and health conditions. 

In an article to be published in the February 
issue of the joumal Nature Methods, the two 
professors and one graduate student explain 
how scientists may be able to use different 
combinations of proteins to trigger stem cells to 
differentiate, or mature, into other specialized 
cells thaI can repair damaged organs and tis-
sue.

continued from page I 
balance to the job. 

"If you vote like a student, (the Board of 
Regents) will treat you like a student," 
Rosenthal said. "We need to vote on what is 
best for the university as a whole. Many pre-
vious student regents have been so busy as 
advocates for students, they don't see the 
bigger picture of the universi ty." 

A law student at UC Davis, Rosenthal 
said he had concerns about the future of 
education and the university when he 
applied to become the next student voice on 
the board, but sees the position as an oppor-
tunity. 

"It is amazing how dedicated the regents 
are and how much they care about the 
school," Rosenthal said. 

Both Anderson and Rosenthal said they 
urged students interested in serving as stu-
dent regent to apply for the position. 

Applicants must be able to serve a two-
year term, during which they are enrolled in 
an undergraduate or graduate program at a 
UC school. Applications for the position are 
available at http://www. univtrrjtyojcalifo-

to eliminate the collectio n of

employees through a 2003 ballot 
measure, Proposition 54. 

\\ hen it failed, Connerly pro-

posed a multiracia l category for 
students applying to the 
University of California; he was 
the only regent to vote for the 
proposal. 

Despite his highly publicized 
and controversial stance on racial 
issues, Connerly ha often allied 
himself strongly with UC students 
and staff, according to Lilla. 

"He was really in tune with 
sntdents on other issues," Lilla 
said. "He was adamantly against 
fcc increases, more vociferously so 
than any other regent. He ardent-
ly pushed for domestic partner-
ship rights and co-authored reso-

programs." 

But it will be Conneriy's cru-

and not his effort in the e endeav-

she said . 

"The race snIff will always over-

Connerly is campaigning in 
Michigan to pass similar legisla-

Unit caps needlessly hinder students 
By ROBIN AVERBECK 

StaR Writer 

A university education today primarily serves as a step-ping stone. You get in, you 
get out and you get busy. As high-
er education has become more and 
more a prerequisite for entrance to 
the middle class, the goal of the 
student is to get a degree as soon 
as possiblc, and the goal of the 
university is to accommodate as 
Illany students as possible in 
achieving this goal. 

Unit caps, which limit how 
many units a student can take in 
any given quarter as well as over the 
course of their undergraduate 
career, are just one institutional 
expression of this trend . 
Interestingly, however, they hinder 
the ethos of the educational drive 
toward prosperity. At first glance, 
unit caps eem practical - after all, 
ci1e university can hardly spe nd its 
time providing shelter and occupa-
tion to the hobos of the education-
al system. But at the same time, 
unit caps seelll to be utterly at odds 
with at least the theoretical objec-
tive of higher education - the pur-
suit of knowledge. 

T hose who pursue a doublc-
major may well understand this 
conflict. In the hi tory deparonent, 
for exa mple, even double- majors 
must graduate after 240 units. This 
hardly seems fair; uouble-majoring 
probably rc ults in double the 
back-tracking and fnind-changing 
as docs a normal major, which is 
why the wllversity should provide 
plenty of room fo r maneuvering. 

o unit caps should be instituted , 
sa v.: for a safeguard against the 
extreme - a 340-uni t ca p perhaps 
for the ecccntric fe\~ who hope [0 
one d,IY reminisce about their 
seventh and eighth year of / 

college. Beyond this, however, a 
unit cap seems unreasonable and 
discouraging for students with a 
healthy appetite for knowledge and 
an energetic ambition. Although 
many students double major to 
have an even more impressive 
resume upon graduating, there is 
undeniably a certain attraction for 
those who enjoy it so much that 
they simply cannot choose. In addi -
tion, if school is not a particular 
misery, there is not always a need to 
speed ahead like lightening to the 
finish line of graduation. It is hard 
to disappoint pure lovers of learn-
ing for the sake of admitting more 
ladder-climbers; although graduate 
school presumably allows for the 
academically addicted to freely 
carry on, it still seems a sorry thing 
to curb the flowering of options 
and possibilities in an undergradu-
ate career. The idealism of knowl-
edge for knowledge's sake is hard to 
completely abandon - what hi gh 
school teacher, for example, would 
ever dissuade a student from read-
ing more books or doing more 
assignments than neces-
sary> 

However, unit 
caps can also frus-
t rate the logic 
behind the "race-
to-the-top" func-
tion of higher 
education. If 
higher educa-
tion is all 
abo u t 

preparing for the job market in our 
modern capitalist society, it seems 
reasonable to let capitalist rules 
apply at the university level. If one 
wishes to be particularly ambi tious 
and stack up an impressive list of 
majors, minors and other academic 
pursuits, then the university ought 
to grant them the freedom to do so 
- especially considering that the 
individual will have to pay for it. 
Raising ruition fees after the com-
pletion of a certain number of cred-
its seems reasonable, as it allows for 
the individual to take more credits 
if desired but also requests com-
pensation for the extra space being 
occupied beyond the expected stay. 
But these higher rates should not 
be unreasonable. Although allow-
ing as many stud.ents as possible to 
obtain higher education is a 'reason-
able goal, it hardly seems right to 
seriously hinder personal ambition 
in the process. To do so might 
make sense in a less competi tive 

OP-ED 

society, but in a culture where 
relentless work and personal drive 
seem necessary for success, it is 
anathema to deny these traits in an 
instirution tangled up in preparing 
students for the work world. 

Although higher education 
should be available to everyone, 
distribution of time and resources 
should not exceed the point where 
it hinders those who may be more 
enthusiastic or ambitious. It seems 
unjust to put the brakes on a stu-
dent's energetic attempt to con-
struct something grand so that an 
indifferent student can construct 
something mediocre - and in the 
long run it will probably only 
deprive our culrure of the kind of 
geni us that such energy can con-
tribute to society.

Connerly's regent term misunderstood 
T his week's UC Board of Regents meeting was Regent Ward Connedy's 
last as a member of the board. 
After 12 yearli of service to this 
state and Our great university, 
Connerly\; term will come to an 
end March 1. Despite Connerly's 
very public image, I contMd that 
he remains an enigma. 

I have immense respect for 
Connedy's idealism vis-a-vis 
equality. I say this despite the fact 
that I vehemently disagree with 
the means he believes are neces-
sary to achieve this important and 
necessary sOC.ietal goal. What 
makes Connerly such a fascinat-
ing and intriguing 6gure is not 
the fact that he is a mixed-race 
man who advocates for an end to 
affirmative action. Rather, it is 
that he is one of the few truly 
intellectually honest ideologues 
to occupy the public sphere. 

Connerly genuine ly believes 
that the government has no right 
to classify or distinguish any indi-
viduals based on their race, gen-
der or sexual orientation. 1 find it 
interesting that, while many stu-
dents can point to Connedy's cnf-
sade against affirmative action in 
the lI1id-1990s, few' students are 
aware of the elltent of his advoca-
cy. For eumple, Connerly also 
led the campaign to grant the 
domestic parmers of gay and les-
bian UC employees the same 
rights as heterosexuals. 

To pigeonhole Connerly as a 
right-wing fanatic is a complete 

mischaracteriL3tion. Perhaps a 
more fitting description is to say 
that he is a "fundamentalist egali-
tarian. n 

I had hoped that in his final 
meeting, his mOSt vocifel:ous foes 
would 6rlaI1y see that Connerly is 
truly a sum of all his pms. I hoped 
that I could tell those students who 
have made it their modus operandi 
over the past J 0 years to berate him 
that he is neither eviloor mad, but 
tather a bona fide idealist_ 
Unfortunately, this will be difficult 
fw me to do; for, ttue to form, on 
his final lap around the regents' 
table, Connerly has once again 
sparked a debate around the sensi-

~e~~eofrnreandaffirrnati~ 
action in higher education. 

Connerly has invited professor 
Richard Sander of the UCLA 
School of Law to speak to the 
regents. Like Conneriy, Sander is 
no stNinger to controversy. This 
past November, Sander published 
a law revit;w article in which he 
argued that law schools that prac-
tice affinnative action, particularly 
in accepting African-American stu-
dents whose grades and LSAT 
scores are below the class average, 
end up doing a disservice to those 
very students and to the legal pro-
fession as a whole. Sander posits 
that students who are admitted 
under the aegis of affirmative 
action are more likely to be at the 
bottom of their law school classes, 
and as a result are less likely to pass 
the bar examination. Furthermore, 
Sander argues that if law schools 

no Jonger practiced affirmative 
action, more African-Americans 
would lIttend law school and enter 
the legal profession. 

There are several problents 
with Sander's research. For exam-
ple. Sander assumes that every 
Afucan-American who is rejected 
from an elite law school will auto-
matically attend a less selective 
institl,ltiOll- This assumption cqmes 
despite 'the fact that the total cOSts 
to attend mOSt law schools (no 
matter ·how selective) hover aroWld 
SI50,000. Also. Sander bases his 
findings on 2001 data. which, 
according to many law-school 
admissions officers, was an atypical 
year. If Sander had used more 
recent and historically reflective 
data from 2003-04, he would ha~ 
found that without affirmative 
action, there would be a dramatic 
25- to JO-pereent decrease jn dte 
number of African-Arnerican 
lawyers entering the.. profession_ 

The larger problem with 
Sander!s worL: does not lie in Statis-
tical wrangling; radter. it is the fact 
that he ignores the bigger and 
much more difficult question of 
why our nation's most prominent 
law schooJs continue to fail Stu-
dents of color. Of more serious 
concern to Californians is that 
after almost 10 years without affir-
mative action, our four public law 

schools continue to (ank among 
the lowest in the nation in the 
nwnber of underrepresented stu-
dents of color. H Sander~ findings 
are correct, how Jong do we have 
to wait until die Califomia legal 
community better represents our 
.state's diversity? 1 fear that if 
Sander's research were to be imple-
mented, whole generations of 
underrcpre$Cnted students will be 

. locked Out of the legal profession. . 
Only the ' furore will tell 

. whether Connerly~ efforts to end 
affirnlative action were executed 
far roo early in the course of our 
nation ~ . history, or at the right 
time. Nevertheless, if we have 
learned anything from the past 10 
Yearli, it has been that as a uni~rsi­
ty, we have an obligation to pre-
pare underrepresented students 
from a young age for the chal-

lel1~ of attending Qut outstand-
ing public professional schools. 
TIlls is certainly a plan that I know 
Connerly has always believed to be 
integral to the mission of the 
Univtnity of CaliforrW.

Men and 
women 

still 
different 
Aftertaste 

Evelyn Hsieh 

A re men still from Mars and women still from Venus? The differences between 
the sexes are indeed ripe for scruti-
ny and debate to this date. D espite 
the advances in women's rights in 
the past century, the issue of equal-
ity between men and wome n still 
proves to be a jighming rod for 
controversy at tl1e beginning of the 
21st century. 

Take for exampl e the recent 
comments of H arvard Presidcnt 
Lawrence H . Summers. who pon-
dered why there were so few 
wo men on the math and engineer-
ing faculty at an economic confer-
cnce this month. According to a 
Jan. 18 Wasbi7zgton Post article, 
"He has provoked a new tonn of 
controversy by suggesting th at the 
shortage of el ite female scientist 
may stem in part from 'innatc' dif-
ferences between men and women. 
... Summers laid out a series of 
possible e.~plan ations for the 
underrepresentation of women in 
the upper echelons of profession al 
life, including upbringing, genetics 
and time spent on chi ld-rearing .... 
Summers pointed to research 
showing that girls are Ie s likely [0 
score top marks than boys in stan-
dardi zed math and science tests, 
even though the median scores of 
hoth sexes are omparable." 

Summers later clarifi ed his 
stateme nts, indicating that hi s 
intention was not to suggest that 
women were incapable or some-
how inhibited from succeedi ng in 
technical or scientific fields, but 
rather to provoke and stimulate. 
Well, he c rtainly accomplished 
that! 

In terms of the UCSD under-
graduate body, it is hard to dispute 
the fact that males and femal es arc 
in no way evenly distributed across 
all majors. For instance, according 
to fall 2004 third-week statistics, 
females made up 13 percent of 
electricaJ and computer engineer-
ing majors, and 24 percent of com-
puter engineering majors. Contrast 
this to the 74 percent of psycholo-
gy majors and 74 percent of com-
munication majors that are female. 
Let's have a CSE/psychology 
mixer, yeah? Majors with a more 
even distribution of the sexes 
include economics, political sci-
ence and, gasp, math! And who 
would have known biology is made 
up of 60 percent women? 

Of course, numbers can mean a 
lot and can also mean very little. 
But I always tlunk about how I can 
count the ' number of guys in an 
upper division communications 
elass on one hand; how there was 
one male student among maybe 15 
in a career center humanities and 
social sciences graduate application 
workshop; how my gal pal tells nie 
~he is one of the few and proud 
fema les in most of her ECE cla es. 
And I admi re her a lot for sticking 
it out with the rest of the guys . 

It's worth asking whether

R I LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
Connerly's legacy' 

tarnishes univerSity 
Editor: 

Ward Connerly's departure sig-
nals a significant turning point for 
the UC system. It provides the 
UC Board of Regents with the 
chance not only to stop the 
onslaught of his crusade to reseg-
regate colleges and universities, 
but presents the regents with the 
challenge to reverse the devastat-
ing damage that has resulted . 

We could sum up the tenure of 
Ward Connedy a having crea ted 
the most devastating setback for 
equality in California, the first 
majority-minority state in the 
country. As the center of these 
a nacks, Connerly reflected one 
response to California's growing 
multiculturalism. 

In the face of the state's chang-
ing demographics, Connerly took 
a stand for white privilege. The 
undeniable results of his policies 
are now in . Black srudent enroll -
ment at UC Berkeley and UCLA 
are at an a ll -time low, and the vast 
underrepresentation of Latinos, 
the ingle largest proportion of 
high schooler in the state, is cre-
ating growing anger and resent-
ment among black and Latino 
youths. 

Ward Connerly's legacy? To 
tarnish both the rcali ty and the 
image of the UC system, the most 
prestigious public university sys-
tem in the world . Connerly's 
legacy is to make California a 
leading center of segregation and 
racial divisiveness , a place in 
which public education is increas-
ingly segregated , separate and 
unequdl , and where the promise 
of Brown v. Board of Educlltion is

ever more faint . 
On the other hand , the last 

twO yea rs have shown that the 
people of California are rejecting 
Connerly's program of white 
privilege and growing inequality. 
T he resounding defeat of 
Proposition 54 and his "multicul -
tural box" show that California is 
poised to move in a progressive 
direction . In 2001, when the 
regents reversed the ban on affir-
mative action, they pledged to 
improve racial diversity in the 
UC system. Now is the moment 
to make that pledge real. We call 
on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
to appoint a replacement for 
Connerly who stands squarely 
and firmly for integration and 
diversity. The governor should 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

appoint someone who is prepared 
to use the Supreme Court's deci-
sion in G,..,ttttr v. Bollinger to 
improve the quality of education 
within the UC system by guaran-
teeing that a critical mass of 
underrepresented minority stu-
dents be present on every cam-
pus. We call on the regents to 
stand on their vote in 2001 and 
use every means available to them 
to institute affirmative action 
programs - the only meaningful 
desegregation measures ever for-
mulated to bring about real inte-
gration within the UC system, 
and to make the University of 
California reclaim its reputation 
once again as a beacon of educa-
tion and enlightenment and a 
proponent of equal opportunity 
in education . 

This is the moment when the 
eyes of the world are measuring 
this nation's commitment to 
democracy. It behooves the 
regents and the sta te of California 
to advance. democracy within our 
state.

OPINION 5 

Column: Gender stereotypes 
can't explain exceptions 
continued from page 4 

women's relative attraction to non-
technical fields correlates to their 
gender-specific ways of thinking. 
I'm pretty sure any guy would testi -
fy to the mismatch of perceptions 
and feelings between themselves 
and their female peers. We're pretty 
emotional and analytical - is that 
why many of us flock to the human-
ities and social sciences - where 
papers requiring critical thinking 
and dissecting sym-
bols are more preva-
lent? Dissecti ng a 

" 

toward males . But that's another 
story. 

I also suppose that trying to fig-
ure out why there exists few "elite 
female scientists" and a great imbal -
ance in certain majors is beside the 
point. While forces of discourage-
ment, both social and instirutional, 
mo t likely exis t along gender lines 
in academic fields , opporrunities to 
fulfill whichever track of life one 
desires seem to abow1d more than 

man 's intentions, or 
an author's literary 
devices, what's the 
difference? Guys, I'd 
argue , are more 
objective in their 
thought processes. 
They are often fond 
of video games and 
sportS (not like some 
girls aren 't, though), 
are straightforward 
in their actions, 
rarely reading into 
anything. Is that at all 
linked to why many 
of them prefer num-
bers instead of 
words, progranuning 
instead of essays> 

Is there a need to 
rnnl<e all majars 
gender balanced? 

ever before. Is 
there a need to 
make all majors 
gender halancelP 
No. But if some-
thing is prevent-
ing girls from 
becoming engi-
neers and bOI"

No . But if something 
is preventing girls 
from becoming 

engineers and boys 
from being 

psychologists ar 
nurses, it should be 

addressed. " 

The beaul'\' of 
the differe'~l:es 
between men and 
women is in their 
compatibility as 
well as in thei I' 
lack of ri gid ity. 
t\nd when differ-
ences do cau;e 
friction, such a 
in the academi c I guess that 

would suggest "innate differences" 
in the configuration of our choices 
of majors and careers, bur it would-
n't cover why there are successful 
female chemical engineers or bril-
liant male communication scholars. 

The emphasis on math and sci-
ence proficiency, reflected in 
Advanced Placement courses and 
in technological competition with 
other countries - such as India 
and China - might also conceal an 
indirect and inadvertent preference 

rea lm, it can be a sign of insuffi -
ciency, but also of progress . 
Summers' comments m ay have 
caused a hubbub, but that's not a 
terrible thing, lest we forget that 
having this debate at all would have 
been unheard of less than a centur\, 
ago. The future is houndl ess, and 
not colored blue or pink .

Music: 
Service would 
offer discount 
student rate 

continued from pag~ J 
between two main content provider 
types. The first would be a program 
such as the one currently in use at 
UC Berkeley, which allows students 
to use Rhapsody - a private online 
music provider - at a discounted 
price. With this program, students 
would pay a monthly fee of $2 and 
an additional 79 cents per song. The 
second possibility would charge by 
the song and have no monthly fee. 

As at UC Berkeley, any service 
would be optional for students, as 
well as for individual campuses. 

"This is just a way to leverage 
the combined sizes of the systems 
to get a cheaper cost," Lunardini 
said. "It will be up to thc individual 
campuses to decide whether they 
want to use the services." 

Whether the students or the 
university will pay for the program 
will also be decided when the offers 
are reviewed. 

"Obviously, we're a public in ti-
tution and we would like to keep 
cost to students at a minimum, as 
well as [theJ cost to the school," 
Lunardini said. 

However, tile efficacy of a pro-
gram in combati ng the problem of 
illegal file sharing is still uncerrain, 
according to UC D Academic 
Computing ervices Director 
Anthony Wood . 

"An y program that we establish 
will [considerJ only the interest of 
students who are trying to do things 
in an honest way," said Wood, who 
is also a Digi tal Millennium 
Copyright agent, meaning dlat he 
handl es all notices of copyright 
infringement on campus. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Valerie Locke said she 
also remained skeptical about the 
effectiveness of the program. 

"Coll ege students don't have 
enough money to pay a dollar for 
each song when they could just 
download it for free," Locke said. 
"Only the students who arc already 
paranoid about getting caught 
would [use the serviceJ." 

At UC Berkeley, not many stu-
dents responded to the offer, 
although the univcrsi ty has not 
deternuned why, according to Wood. 

"It's hard to say whether it's due 
to lack of interest or lad of mar-
keting," Wood said . 

The UC system, however, will 
continue with its current efforts to 
undermine illegal file-sharing, 
according to Lunardini, mainly 
tluough information sessions held 
during new-student orientations. 

"[This programJ is one tool that 
might help mitigate the problem 
over the long term, just like you've 
seen with iTunes in the larger mar-
ket," Lunardini said. "But technol -
ogy is changing so quickly and 
other things are changing so quick-
ly that it is hard to say at this point 
what will help."

By CHIISnNE PAE 
Senior Staff Writer 

They walk with impeccable posture and wear smart uniforms, attracting attention from all around. It seems 
there is a certain novelty in spotting men 
and women in uniform in a sea of students 
sporting UCSD sweatshirts and pajama 
pants. 

The uniformed students are enrolled in 
the Reserve Officer Training Corps, a pro-
gram that allows college students to achieve 
military officer status while completing 
their undergraduate studies at a university. 
Distinctly separate from the recruitment of 
high chool students soon after graduation, 
ROTC is aimed at training students to 
become college-educated military officers. 

"Tt's to train you to become an officer in 
the Navy. It teaches you to be a leader for 
our great nation, " Eleanor Roosevelt 
College sophomore and Navy ROTC stu-
dent Jamie Johnson said. 

At the crack of dawn, UCSD students in 
ROTC make their way to the University of 
San Diego to take additional courses. The 
academic agenda in ROTC is chaUenging 
and is geared to be comprehensive not only 
in military science and engineering, but 
also in writing and history. Navy ROTC 
includes an entire year of Navy science 
courses, a year of calculus and several 
courses in computer science, weapons 
design and leadership. 

In addition, weekly drill meetings are 
held every Tuesday at 5:45 a.m. Dressed in 
uniform, students convene to take required 
attendance, meet up for formation and get 
a briefing on issues relevant to military life. 
Upon returning to UCSD, they have an 
obligation to wear their uniforms on cam-
pus. 

Every semestel', Navy ROTC conducts a 
physical fitness assessment, including a 
swimming and sailing proficiency test. 
Community service and fundraising are 
important parts of the program, which can 
be especially demanding while ta king a full 
load of university courses. 

The biggest drawback for ROTC stu-
dents is the time commitment. 

"Sometime it can be a Little overwhelm-

I ' I , 

ing, but it hasn 't been anything that is 
unimaginable," sa id Earl Warren College 
sophomore Chad Allen , a avy ROTC stu-
dent. "It's only two days a week, so it' 
nothing that the average person shouldn't 
be able to handle. It teaches time manage-
ment. " 

The academic load and physi ca l 
demands of the program may sound unat-
tractive to some, but there is much to 
inspire the students who join ROTC. 

One incentive is the financial support it 
offers. ROTC students at UCSD receive 
full scholarships for their academic tuition , 
earning about $20,000 to $25 ,000 during 
their time spent in the program. In addition 
to the scholarship, students receive about 
$250 a month as a stipend with an incre-
mental increase of $50 a year. 

Students have the option of leaving the 
program during their freshman year if it is 
not what they had expected. However, if a 
student resigns his or her position as an 
ROTC student after freshman year, that 
student is automatically relocated to enlist-
ment service, which greatly reduces their 
chances of becoming an officer. 

Although a full scholarship may sound 
tempting, there is a catch. Students who 
make the commitment to ROTC must 
devote eight years of their lives as military 
officers after graduation. Four years of 
active service are followed by four years as 
an on-call reserve officer. 

"When you get out into the Navy, you 
have a guaranteed job, and you're getting 
paid," said johnson , who is training to 
become a Navy officer and a pilot. "J defi-
nately think it's worth it." 

But some students say there is more to 
the ROTC experience than the monetary 
gains. Earl Warren College junior and 

avy ROTC student jonathan Lim, wh o 
will be an officer by age 22, said the lead-
ership experience and the challenges it 
brings are the most rewarding aspects of 
the program. 

"I wanted the life and leadership experi-
ence," Lim said. "I think everyone needs to 
pay their dues to themselves, to give per-
spective in life. Vou have to go through 
some hardships to go through life." 

The concept of being in the military 

. . , f' I I' 

becomes a blinding reality when students 
are given the opportunity for hands-on 
experience with equipment, machines, air-
craft and submarines. 

"It' a lot more intense when you're in 
the situation," Lim said . "You can always 
just talk about what it 's like, but when 
you're out at ea in a submarine, it's very 
different. " 

The prestige of bei ng in the military i 
simply a fringe benefit to some ROTC stu-
dents. 

"I like the military lifestyle, and [ like 
the idea of serving my country," sa id John 
Muir college freshman and Air Force 
ROTC student Amber Rounce. "P eople 
think the military is just about wars, but 
you can have all sons of professions, like 
being a doctor. " 

Family tradition in the military is also a 
major motivation to complete the ROTC 
program. Rounce, like other children of 
parents in the Navy (known by some as 
"Navy brats"), feels driven to follow her 
parent's footsteps . 

According to Rounce, there are few 
women who enroll in the ROTC program; 
only 20 percent of ROTC students are 
women , Even with few women in the mili-
tary - and particularly few in ROTC -
women are treated with equal level s of 
respect, Rounce said, describing the atmos-
phere as a brother-sister relationship 
among the men and women. 

"They 're respectful, but r think women 
could take more initiative in leadership 
roles in this country," she said. 

In addition to the leadership skill s 
offered in ROTC, the opportunity to trav-
el is another motive that drives ROTC stu-
dents. Thc largest Navy bases are in San 
Diego, but there arc others in many locales, 
including Italy; Okinawa, Japan ; and Pearl 
Harbor, Hawaii . 

"During the summer while we 're stu-
dents, we have a training program tha t's 
implemented in units across the nation , and 
you get to experience different crui ses," 
j ohnson said. "As a pilot, you'll be abroad 
on ship and travel around th e world."

MONDAY. JANUARY H. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Snow: Peter Mehrhof takes first in slalom event 
continued from page l:l 

returning slciers from UCSD, 
sophomore Evan Sharbrough, fin-
ished first for the event, wh ile 
sophomore J ake Cohen placed 
ninth . 

A newcomer also shone on the 
men's slalom. Senior Peter 
Mehrhof placed first in his first 
race as a member of the UCSD slci 
team. As a native of the Mammoth 
area, Mehrhof is very familiar with 
the mountain 's runs. 

Mehrhof joins Vane, 
Sharbrough. and Cohen as the top 
male skiers on the team this season. 
Cuhen. Sharbrough and Vane fin-
ished third . fourth and sixth, 
respectively, in the slalom. 

The women dominated their 
slalom as well. Freshman Anja 
Smith led the fi eld with the fas test 
time, while senior Sierra Bourne 
finished right behind her in second 
place. Ski captain Kati e Wurdcn 
fini shed in fourth . while another 
rookie skier, freshman Sarah 
Callaham, finished in fifth . 

"I am stoked with the way our 
team raced in the slalom," Wurden 

said. "You cannot ask for much 
more than having four of the top-
five racers in the event." 

The results of the giant slalom 
looked very similar to those of the 
slalom for the women. Again, Smith 
placed first, and Bourne followed 
right behind her. Bourne began rac-
ing again this year after taking a sea-
son off while studying abroad, Junior 
Brooke Mosley also skied well in the 
event, finishing in fourth. 

Wurden placed in the top five 
for the skier-cross, coming in third . 
whil e rookie Callaham again took 
fifth . 

"We have a strong team," 
Wurden said, "1 am very pleased 
with the way we performed after 
the first week. We have a good 
group of newcomers. and I am 
excited to see how we build as a 
leam this season." 

The snow board team overcame 
more then just a difficult course -
they also had to worry about their 
safety. A midair collision berween

"J remember taking off on this 

huge jump, and then all of a sudden 
I see Scott right on top of me," 
Mitchell said. 

While the collision took Mitchell 
out of the race, Scott continued to 
race down the mountain and was 
able to move on to the next round. 

"I could not believe he was abl e 
to qualify after that fall ." said 
Mitchell. who earlier placed second 
in the snowboard giant slalom. 

T he women's snowboard team 
was able to walk away with a victo-
ry as a result of junior Billiana 
Veleva's first-place fini sh in the 
snowboard gi ant slalom. 

"J could not be more pleased 
with the way we raced, " Mitchell 
said . "The people do an excellent 
job at setting up the obstacles, the 
jumps are very technical, and the 
course is very demanding. "

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team traveled to Ca rson, 
Calif., to challenge Ca l State 
Dominguez Hills on Jan. 21 and 
Pomona, Calif., to play Cal Poly 
Pomona on Jan. 22, but fell short 
by five points in both games. The 
Tritons fa ll to a 8-7 overall record 
and a 4-4 league split. 

The Tritons lost to Cal State 
Doming\lez Hills (8-5 overall, 6-1 
CCAA) at the Torodome Arena, 
6 1-56. 

Top players in the game for 
the Tritons included senior cen-
ter Marga ret Johnson, with 15 
points and a game- high 23 
rebounds. Only four of Johnson's 
15 points were field goals; she 
made 7 -of-9 in free-throw 
attempts. 

Sophomore gua rd Leora 
Juster posted II points and senior 
center Stacy Gallagher-Bolton 
added eight. Junior guard Andrea 
Herold and sophomore forward 
Hillary Han en also posted eight 
points apiece. 

UCSD struggled to score 
throughout the game, averaging 
only 30 percent in field goals. 
T he Tritons went only 2-for- 19 
in three-point shooting in the 
ga me, and O-for-II in the second 
half. By the end of the first half, 
the Tritons trailed by four points, 
28-24. 

Tameka Blue led scoring for 
the l o ros with 18 points. Brittney 
Blankenship and Octavia Askew 
added II and eight points, 
respectively, to help the Toros 

clinch the win. 
The next game for the Tritons 

was against CCAA opponent Cal 
Poly Pomona (11-4 overall, 6-2 
CCAA) at the Kellogg Gym. 
UCS D fell to the Bronco , 83-78, 
in an other tough bout. 

The Tritons struggled once 
again in field-goal scoring. 
Despite the one-point deficit at 
halftime, UCSD could not pull 
through in the second half. The 
Tritons had a 39-percent field-
goa l pe rcentage and made 2-of-8 
three-point attempts for the sec-
ond half. The Tritons only made 
half of the free throws granted to 
them. Comparatively, the 
Broncos fared well with a 42-per-
cent fi eld-goa l percentage and 
61-percent from the free-throw 
line. 

Top scorers in the loss includ-
ed four Tritons in double digits. 
Herold had a strong game, post-
ing 19 points, nine rebounds and 
seven assis ts. Juster added 17 
points and Gallagher-Bolton had 
13. Junior forward Karina Siam 
posted II points, with nine 
rebounds. Johnson had 10 
rebounds in the match. 

Key players for the Broncos 
included Candice Allen and 
Brandi Fletcher, who each posted 
18 points, and Allen with 15 
rebounds. Natasha Deed also 
added 12 points for the Broncos 
to take the win. .

Men's volleyball still 
searching for first win 

DCSD falls to DC Santa 
Barbara, Stanford and Pacific 

By RAEL ENTEEN 
Staff Writer 

Still looking for that elusive fi rst 
win , the UCSD men's volleyball 
team must travel to Los Angeles on 
Jan. 26 to face University of 

outhern California after dropping 
thne games in one week, all to 
ranked teams. The Tritons lost a 
nail-biter, 3-2, to o. 13 UC Santa 
Barbara on Jan. 17, fell to No. 8 
Stanford in straight sets on Jan. 21 
and succumbed to University of 
Pacific in four games for their fifth 
loss of the season on Jan. 22 . 

Though the matches were 
against tough competi tors, head 
coach Ron Larsen was not expect-
ing three losses. 

The losses dropped the Tritons' 
record to 0-5 overall and 0-3 in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. In the match against 
Pacific, the Tritons got off to a 
promising start, winning the first 
game, 30-28. However, the Tigers 
were unfazed and came back with a 
vengennce, taking the next three 

gaml'~ and the match, 30-24, 30-
22, 30-26. Senior outside hitter 
Luke Honnette shone in the loss, 
racking up 27 kills with 28.5 points. 

The game against Stanford was 
one of the marquee matchups of 
the year, with the Cardinal holding 
a top-10 national ranking. T he 
Tritons upset the Cardinal last year, 
paving the way for high expecta-
tions this year, but UCSD could 

not pull off a miraculous upset this 
time, losing three games to none, 
in front of a crowd of more than 
550. 

T he Tritons jumped out to an 
early lead in the first game but 
couldn 't hold on and lost 30-26. In 
the second game, excellent block-
ing on the other side of the net 
smothered the UCSD offensive 
attack. Stanford had 10 blocks in 
the game, twice that ofUCSD , and 
they all seemed to be momentum-
stopping, keeping the Tritons out 
of reach and out of contention. At 
one point, UCSD kept setting up 
beautiful kill shots only to get them 
blocked. T he Tritons tried three 
kills in a row until finally one went 
untouched and hit the Cardinal 
side of the floor. Despite their vic-
tory in that point, the Tritons went 
on to lose the second game 30-21, 
due to a huge Cardinal advantage 
in team attack percentage, .483 to 
UCSD ' .077. 

T he third and final game was 
neck-and-neck until the end. 
UCSD kept taking one-point leads 
only to watch the Cardinal tie it up 
on the next rally. They were up, 15-
14, at one point, and then watched 
tan ford tart to pull away. 

Stanford tied it up, then took the 
lead, 17- 15, only to have the 
l1itons tie it back up at 17 apiece. 
It remained tied at 19 points each; 
however, the Cardinals hit the

"Gnarly," junior Luke Mitchell, 
UCSD snowboard team captain, 
said, after viewing the mountain 's 
obstacles. "That is the only way I can 
describe the deadly course. " 

While a New Year's storm may 
have prevented the UCSD ski and 
snowboard team from competing in 
its first scheduled races, the team let 
nothing stand in its way while racing 
down the courses at Mammoth 
Mountain, Calif., on Jan. 16 and 
Jan. 17. 

"These were definitely the 
most difficult courses I have seen 
since I have been racing," 
Mitchell said. "But the conditions 
did not even seem to phase the 
newcomers. " 

While racers from UCLA, San 
Diego State, Cal State Long Beach 
and defending champion UC Santa 
Barbara dropped out after survey-
ing the courses, all the UCSD 
rookies declined to drop out. As a 
result, they placed in the top five 
for their races.

mances, placing fifth in the men 's

Men's basketball woes continue 
By JOE TEVELOwnI 

Staff Writer 

T he UCSD men's basketball 
team was unable to halt its season-
high losing streak, extending the 
streak to five games by dropping a 
pair of road games on Jan. 21 and 
Jan. 22. Cal State Dominguez Hills 
stifled the Tritons on Jan. 21, 62-
44, at the Torodome. The slide in 
their California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play continued on Jan. 
22 as the team feU, 71 -55, to Cal 
Poly Pomona at the Kellogg Gym. 

The Tritons' pair of losses 
drops them to 5-9 overall and 2-6 
in conference play. Against Cal 
Poly Pomona (11-4 overall, 6-2 
CCAA), UCSD fell behind early, 
14-2, after only eight minutes of 
play. The Tritons, unable to come 
up with any type of an early scor-
ing run, found themselves down 19 
points with less than four minutes 
to play in the half. However, the 
Triton defense forced a number of 
missed shots and turnovers by the 
Broncos. The Tritons went on an 
8-0 run to close the half, capped by 
a buzzer-beating three-pointer by 
freshman guard Clint Allard. 

The UCSD men never got 
closer than the 30-19 halftime 
deficit. The Broncos opened up a 
I5-point lead after halftime and 
pushed their lead to 19 points at 
the midway point of the second 
half. The Tritons were unable to 
sustain a long scoring run as they 
battled back and forth with the 
Broncos from then on. 

Forwards David Sybesma and 
Jeff Bonds led Cal Poly Pomona 
with solid all-around games. 
Sybesma led the team in scoring 
and assists, with game-highs of 18 

and five, respectively, and tied 
Bonds and guard Hervey Malone 
II for the team lead with five 
rebounds. Bonds also account d 
for 15 points, three assists, three 
teals and two blocks in the game. 

Dion Cook contributed a career-
high 16 points for the Broncos. 

Sophomore guard Robby 
Peter's 12 points on 4-of-7 three-
point shooting led the Tritons. 
Andrew Hatch had nine points, 
while sophomore forward Parker 
Berling led the team with five 
rebounds and added five points, 
four assists and two blocks. Junior 
guard Odioh Odiyeh had eight 
points, four assists and four steals. 

The loss was the second in as 
many days that the Tritons were 
behind the entire game. 

The Jan. 21 loss to Cal State 

Dominguez Hills (4-11 overall, 3-
4 CCAA) in Carson, Calif., did 
not start as badly for UCSD. It 
was the Toros who made a run to 
close the first in this game, going 
on an 11 -2 spurt to take a 3 1- 15 
lead into the half. 

The Toros, who UCSD swept, 
2-0 in 2004, were too much for the 
Tritons, out-rebounding them, 41-
26, and holding them to a 28 per-
cent field-goal percentage for the 
game. In the second half, they used 
a 9-2 run early on to open up the 
lead and were up by as many as 25 
points with less than five minutes to 
play. The Tritons' 11-4 run at the 
end of the game wasn't enough to 
close the gap. 

The Toros had three players
