Alcohol Sale CalPIRG Investigates 
A Problem at Prices at Bookstore 
Faculty Olub 

By Reed Alpert 
Editor 

The proposed UCSD faculty 
club may have trouble serving 
beer and wine if the California 
state Alcohol and Beverage 
Control Board decides that the 
campus cannot have two 
separate contractors with 
alcohol licenses, David Ryer, 
assistant chancellor, said 
yesterday . 

With the contract for the 
student pub in Building C 
currently being negotiated with 
proposed contractor Henry 
Goldy who runs the pub at San 
Diego St. the university is 
looking into either not serving 
beer and wine at the faculty 
club or the possibility of 
subcontracting the beer and 
wine concession through Goldy, 
said Ryer. 

There is no state law against 
there being two contractors 
with beer and wine licenses on 
campus, a spokesman- for the 
ABC said, but he added that he 
didn't know if the ABC would 
grant two licenses. 

The sPokesman said there is 
no set criteria to determine if a

Book publishers, not the 
UCSD bookstore, determine the 
retail prices of textbooks, a 
recent CalPIRG study shows. 

" Unfavorable " student 
reaction to the high cost of 
books at UCSD prompted the 
CalPIRG study , which 
revealed that the bookstore 
sells their books at a markup on 
the wholesale price dictated by 
the publisher. 

According to bookstore 
manager Paul Mores, UCSD 
book prices are comparable to 
prices at off-campus retail 
outlets . "I think we are 
competitive with the general 
market. Prices will be just 
about the same wherever you 
go . They (the publishing 
companies) are as bad or worse 
than oil companies in regards 
to setting prices ." 

Textbooks, which are 
ordered by campus professors, 
are marked up" approximately 
20% from the wholesale cost," 
said Mores . The twenty percent 
markup corresponds to the 
recommended retail price.

texts , general information 
books and a myriad of popular 
fiction novels , are sold at a 
" 20% to 40% markup on the 
price paid by the bookstore," 
reported the CalPIRG survey. 
' 'Different categories of books 
carry different margins of 
profit," Mores confirm , " but 
the general book sales are non-
profit. " 

Although the CalPIRG 
survey indicated that prices 
are comparable from one store 
to the next, Mores said , 
" occasionally you will find 
exceptions in price .. .Inflation 
is one reason. If we bought a 
book before the price went up, 
then our price would be lower 
than someone who bought the 
book after it went up. A store 
that sells only the popular titles 
will be able to sell those books 
for less than we do. We feel it is 
more important to carry a wide 
variety of books ." 

Mores also offered an 
explanation as to why the 
bookstore price may occa-
sionally be higher than the 
suggested retail price . 
" Either they didn ' t give us any 
discount on the retail price or 
the discount was too small to 
cover the costs of carrying the 
book. " 

According to CalPIRG, gifts 
and fad items are marked up 
most, as much as 100 percent. 

Said Mores , "Items that are a 
gamble for us to buy ('pet 
rocks ' for example) will be 
marked up the most. 

" We have to make a large 
profit on fad items. If it turns 
out that we' re stuck with them, 
then we might as well throw 
them in the trash." 

The CalPIRG study indicated 
that the net profit has been 
steady since the opening of the 
bookstore, with an exception in 
the academic year 1976-1977, 
when the net profit was over 5%

Governor's Statement 
Surprises Regents 

8y Trapper B rne 
pecial to lhe Guardian 

SAN FRANCISCO - Governor Jerry Brown 
surprised the Board of Regents meeting here 
yesterday by announcing that he is in favor of the 
University of California severing its ties with the 
Livermore and Los Alamos, N .M. nuclear weapons 
development laboratories. -

" I think the time ha come to ay that the nationa l interest is not 
served by thi connection between the Federal Government and 
the University of Californi a ," Brown sa id. "11 should be stated 
very clearly that the Universi ty should separate itself from 
weapons development and get on with its own affai rs ." 

Brown 's comment were in response to the Buchsbaum 
Committee r port, which Department of Energy Assistant 
Secretary Dwane Sewell presented to the Regents yesterday . The 
report recommended that UC maintain and strengthen its ties 
with the weapons labs. 

The Buc hsbaum Committee, a task force set up the the DOE to 
study the relationship between the University and the labs, 
reported that recently there has been " inadequate attention being 
paid by the University to certain needs of the laboratories~" 
However, itsaid the prospects of UC severing its ties with the labs 
are " remote and undesirable." 

Brown, however, said there is " a rising sense of alienation in 
many qua rters as a result of this weapons business ." He predicted 
that "within a reasonably short time the dissent will become the 
majority and the decision to sever the ties with the labs will be 
made anyway." . 

Brown addM that " brea king a relationship is never without 
distress and pain, especially when it involves money ." 

Brown's announcement was followed quickly by similar 
statements by Regents Gregory Bateson and Stanley 
Scheinbaum, who have always favored such a move, and Yori 
Wada, who has been indecisive on the matter. After the meeting, 
Brown said th number of votes on the Board for severing ties with 
the labs is increasing. 

UC President David Saxon took a stand in opposition to Brown, 
saying that the University, as " a bastion of freedom," has a 
responsibility to continue to manage the labs. 

" What has been the outcome after 30 years of UC managing the 
labs? " Saxon asked. " Has the University been ill-served? I submit 
not. " 

Saxon added that " in Korea and Vietnam, we and our opponents 
had the ultimate weapon at hand, and did not use it. That ultimate

Naming Third Is 
Not That Tough 
Each try at finding a permanent name for Third College 

has been erratic and ill-considered , and we believe that the 
latest attempt is the weakest of all. 

Last spring, about a third of the college voted to establish 
the name "Third" as the permanent name of the college, 
but a campus committee that recommends to the 
chancellor whether names of campus facilities should be 
approved turned it down, arguing that the na me " Third" 
might not have relevance in the future . 

The committee, headed by Muir Provos t John Stewart, 
thus succeeded in ignoring the express wishes of a la rge 
part of the Third community. 

This spring, the college decided to go back a nd try aga in . 
Ballots were printed listing seve n names c hosen by the 

Third College Council. 
Voting was allowed only in the Dea n' s office, a nd 

publicity was inadequate. Only about a tenth of the college 
voted, but those that did vote chose " Third " 
overwhelmingly , then " Sequoyah" and " Lumumba-
Zapata ." 

But the Council refused to place Sequoyah or Lumumba-
Zapata on a final ballot, choosing instead Third and 
"Martin Luther King" to occupy ballot slots in the run-off. 

Their reason? Sequoyah or Lumumba-Zapata are 
"inappropriate" names for the college. People won' t 
understand Sequoyah, the council said, and Lumumba-
Zapata will "alienate too many parents." 

• • • 
The college's second attempt to name itself has not 

produced the kind of interest or support that we feel justifies 
recommending a name to Stewart's committee, the 
chancellor and, eventually, the Regents. 

However, coupled with last year's overwhelming choice 
of "Third" as a pennanent name for the college, we feel 
that the students, faculty and staff have clearly voiced their 
choice for a college name. 

So what's the holdup with the naming process?

Telecom Competition 
Would Fuel Technology 

By Michael Singsen 
Pacilic News Service 

T he promise of deregu-lation - and techno-logica l breakthroughs 
ranging from computers-on-a-
chip to optical fiber cables - is 
sparking a competitive free-
for-all in the U.S. telecom-
munications industry. 

As never before in the 
industry's brief 50-year 
history, companies are battling 
toe to toe over entire 
communication systems -
from the satellites in orbit to the 

boob tube in our pa rlors . The 
networks of the future will 
involve both digital computer 
and voice transmis ion, using a 
combina tion of satellites , 
microwave relay stations, 
cable television and through-
the-air broadcasting. 

Up for grabs are huge 
industry profits - second only 
to those produced in a Kuwait 
oil field - and ultimate control 
of U.S. information systems. 

technologies might cut into 
their profit a nd render old 
equipment obsolete. All we re 
prevented from competing 
effectively for years. 

• • • 
ut now. it appears, both B the FCC and Congres are on a new wave-
length . 

Keating's Clinic Cares 

Rep. Lionel Van Deerlin (0-
San Diego) , whohas introduced 
a bill that would virtually 
abolish public control of the 
industry , says the new 
technologies will stimulate "a 
revolution ... roughly equivalent 
to the industrial revolution of 
the nineteenth century." 

Others see a nightmare, a 
" galactic clash" according to 
one industry observer, that will 
silence public claim to the 
airwaves and legalize cor-
porate control of all voice, 
video and digital transmissions 
in the U.S. 

" I believe," asserts FCC 
Chairman Charles Ferris , 
" that the public interest 
demands that the Commission 
replace regulation with 
competition as a regulatory 
tool whenever possible . 
Regulation should not impede 
the dynamic forces of 
technological change. " 

This new interest in 
innovation stems partly from 
the growing concern that 
American corporations are 
losing their traditional lead in 
practical applications of 
telecommunications tech-
nology.

In fact, Sharon's CCEC is 

probably the best run 
department on this entire 
campus. To run a clinic of this 
size involves for Sharon, 
staffing the clinic, making 
appointments, much coun-
seling and seeing to it that 
everyone is treated with 
concern and respect. When 
someone walks into CCEC they 
often feel uncomfortable . 
Sharon smiles warmly, greets 
you and immediately you feel 
at ease. 

Sharon's concern for other 
people extends beyond her job. 
In addition to bi-weekly birth 
control raps, she, on her own 
time, has lectured on our 
various colleges and in classes 
on sexuality and birth control 
and she has a regular column in 
some of the campus publica-

important, Sharon's concern is 
for the individual. 

Confronted with an unwanted 
pregnancy, a couple must 
make difficult choices and deal 
with often painful and 
conflicting feelings . For a 
woman alone all of these 
feelings become even greater. 
Add on to all of this the 
pressures or being a student 
and you've got people afraid, 
hurt, confused, self-con-
demning, sad and often unable 
to cope well with regular 
everyday life. Sharon concerns 
herself with these and all of ber

Several countries are

"Regulation s.hould not impede the 
dynamic forces of technological 
change." 
Today, a mere handful of 

corporations rule the telecom-
munications empire. Three 
television networks - ABC, 
CBS, NBC - jointly earning 
more than $3 billion in 1977, 
dominate commercial broad-
casting to the point where it is 
impossible to think about TV 
without them. 

And IBM, the fifth largest 
corporation in the United 
States, enjoys a 70 percent 
share of the computer market. 

Traditionally the govern-
ment, throu~h the Federal 
Communications Commission 
(FCC) and the Communica-
tions Act of 1934, has been the 
guardian angel of both the 
public and much of the 
industry . Mandated by 
Congress to protect " the public 
interest ," the FCC has also 
protected industry giants from 
competing technologies or 
services . 

For instance, FM radio, UHF 
television aod cable TV were all 
shackled by the FCC in tbeir 
fonnatlve years in response to 
complaints from commercial 
broadcasters that these new

The industry claims that 
over-regulation prevents 
American corporations from 
developing new services. 

But a policy report prepared 
for the House Subcommittee on 
Communications suggests 
another reason: "The primary 
obstacle inhibiting change in 
the current status quo is the 
fact that all the international 
telecommunications com-
panies are making healthy 
profits from the business. 
Consequently, they want to 
reinforce rather than change 
the status quo and to inhibit or 
restrict competition. " 

In fact, the corporations in 
commanding market positions 
are fighting deregulation tooth 
and nail - or else bidding for a 
compromise that will preserve 
their own advantages while

Palestinian Plan Okayed Nuke Study Gets Way Gasoline on the Way 

TEL AVIV. Israel (AP) - A Cabinet committee 
yesterday a pproved a 22-point plan for Palestinian 
autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza. 

A State Radio broadcast said the committee voted 
unanimously to prevent an independent state in the 
occupied areas a nd uphold Israel's intention to 
reassert its cla im to both area after five yea rs. 

In a point-by-point vote during a seven-hour 
meeting, the 11 ministers endorsed Begin 's 
conception of Palestinian self-rule promised by the 
Israel-Egypt peace treaty. 

The plan goes to the full Cabinet next Monday and 
Israeli-Egyptia n talks on autonomy begin May 25. 

From press reports and Begin's previous 
statements, the plan was known to include: 
- Making the Israeli military government the source 
of the autonomy, with security and public order the 
responsibility of Israeli forces . 
- Keeping state land and water sources under Israeli 
control. 
- Continued Jewish settlement in the territories, with 
Israeli settlers under Israeli jurisdiction. 

Venice Sinking Stopped 
VENICE, ItaIY'(AP) - Venice has stopped sinking. 

In fact , the lagoon city famous for its 10,000 paintings, 
frescoes and sculptures has actually risen ever so 
slightly. 

That's the conclusion of a team of Italian scientists 
after years of observation and laboratory tests. 

The finding, endorsed by the Italian government 
and laboratories worldwide, is "definitive and final," 
says Dr. Paolo Gatto, a senior geologist at the stale-
run National Research Council. 

Once a doomed victim of industrialization and 
bureacratic inertia, Venice now appears to be winning 
the fight against water and pollution .

Rec Facilities Approval 
Would -Raise Fee by $5 

By Eric HarpeU 
Senior S&alf WrUer 

A five dollar increase in 
student fees may be slated for 
CaU 1981 if UCSD students vote 
in favor of the recreation 
Cacilities proposal on Wednes-
day and Thunday's student 
.referendum. 

The referendum asks student 
to aUot a fee increase Cor 
constructine and maintaining 
"Student Recreation Facili-
ties," which will consist of "a 
swlmmine pool, two jacuzzis, 
rive racquetball/handball 
courts, and a shower !locker 
room." Also included in the 
proposal is ni,ht li,hting for the 
Muir field. 

The support of those students 
The support of 2/3 of those 

students votine is necessary to 
pass the Rec Facilities 
proposal, said a committee 
member, who added, 
"McElroy has final say on what 
constitutes a winnine margin ... 

The new facilities, which will 
coit 11,001,000, are to be 

financed by a Regents loan' that 
carries a 9.5% interest rate. 
According to the election 
marshals, the loan will be 
repaid over a 25-year period at 
$106,595 per year. There will be 
an additional $43,405 used per 
year Cor maintenance. 
According to a Rec Facilities 
Committee member, "The 
yearly cost of the Cacilities was 
set by how much students were 
willing to pay." 

The Student Opinion Survey 
conducted in May 1978 
indicated that a majority of the 
students responding (59%) 
indicated that they were willing 
to pay a $5 increase in fee to 
fund more recreational 
facilities . 

The proposa I originally 
called for the building of a gym 
in addition to the planned 
facilities. Financing for the 
earlier proposal included the 
soliciting of girt funds for a new 
gymnasium. However, "the 
Chancellor has a policy of only 
accepting gift funds for one 

thing ata time. Right now, he is 
getting gift funds for a proposed 
cancer center," said a 
committee member. 

According to the e lection 
marshals, the proposed 
facilities are to be located just 
north oC the Warren West Field, 
and are to be run by a student 
committee consisting of six 
voting representatives, one 
each to be appointed by the 
ASUCSD, the GSC, and the four 
college councils . Three 
nonvoting consultants will 
assist in operation of the 
facilities. 

The Rec Facilities Commlt-
tee believes that the fee 
increase would be greater if the 
proposal was not voted on until 
next year. 

A committee spokesman 
indicated that the same 
proposal would result in a $6 fee 
increase if it were not passed by 
the students until nex t year. "It 

·would cost $7.20 if we waited 
two, due to skyrocketing 
inflation costs."

Helico'pterRescue Service Considered 
A helicopter rescue service. 

which can reach the scene of an 
accident in half the time it takes 
paramedics, may be imple-
mented at the UCSD Medical 
Center. 

Plan Cor " Life Flight," the 
24-hour helicopter ambulance, 
are currently awaiting 
approva 1 {rom the Health 
Systems Agency, according to 
Dr. William Baxt, associate 
director oC the emergency 
medical services at UCSD 
Medical Center. 

" If all goe smoothly, the 
helicopter could be operating 
by December." said Baxt. 

The largest need for Life 
Flight will be in Imperial 
County and the rural areas of 
North County, Baxt said. 

Life Flight will reach persons 
in need of emergency medical 
services in inaccessible areas, 

Med Center Proposes "Life Flight" 
provide them with expert pre-
hospital treatment and 
transport them to an emer-
gency facility , said Baxt. 

The Life Flight system 
centers around the use of a 
single Alouette III jet 
helicopter which will be paid 
for with univers ity funds . 
according to Bax!. He said the 
annual cost of running the 
helicopter ambulance is 
approximately $300,000. 

Baxt added that the Life 
Flight project received " JOO 
percent" support from the 
university. 

Patients will be charged a 
fee of $150 to $200 for the 
helicopter service. said Baxt. 

" At present, patients in 
Imperial County can pay up to 
$400 for an ambulance." he 
said. 

" The fee will be a drop in the 
bucket, but it will pay for some 
expenses," remarked Baxt. 

Life Flight will be dispatched 
with an attending level 
physician and a trained flight 
nurse. " Our crew will be a lot 
more tra ined than para -
medics , " said Baxt. The 
helicopter can carry up to two 
patients , he added . 

The helicopter will have a top 
speed of 120 miles per hour and 
a range of 150 miles, Baxt said. 

While it takes an ambulance 
almost three hour to reach a 

patient in Imperial Valley and 
transport him/ her to a hospital, 
it will take Life Flight less than 
halC that time. said Baxt. 

The system will be activated 
through a communications 
center at the UCSD Medical 
Center, with land lines to every 
major public safety agency and 
medical care facility in the 
area . Baxt said the service will 
not respond to calls from the 
public because "that would be 
too extreme." 

" Within five minutes after 
receiving the call, the 
helicopter will be up in the air," 
said Baxt, adding that the 

rotors can be shut down in 45 
econds. 
Baxt said that the helicopter 

crew will react to patients, 
stabilize them at the scene and 
transport them to the nearest 
hospital with landing facilities 
and appropriate treatment 
capabilities. 

Patients will only be 
transported directly to 
University Hospital if referred 
there by an outside physician. 
said Baxt. This will include 
cases in which the patient 
requires treatment at the bum, 
trauma or infant care centers 
oC the hospital. 

Baxt estimates that Life 
Flight will carry about 400 
patients a year, saving a 
"minimum" of 50 lives .

Undergrad Lab Safety 
A Matter for Concern 

By John Brock 
Stall Writer 

Concern about safety in 
UCSD undergraduate labora-
tories has re ulted in an effort 
by members of the faculty and 
staff to raise the "safety 
consciou ness" of students 
here. according to AI Rea, 
campus Environmental Health 
and Safety Officer. 

" There is currently no big 
problem with teaching lab 
afety," stated Rea. "But even 

so. we want e\'eryone to be 
thinking about afety so that no 
such problem does arise." 

Rea said that the Environ-

about afety procedures is a 
built-in process given by the 
professors and T.A.s in any 
given course. " 

When students have ques-
tions about safety procedures , 
they should always ask their 
instructors, said Rea. He al 0 
pointed out that the Safety 

Office is also a lwClYs available 
to advise anyone a bout possible 
hazards. 

" From a safety standpoint," 
noted Rea , " the lab them-

Division III Tennis Nationals 
By Henry J. DeVries 

Staff WI-iter 
UCSD's P a ul Metsch 

advanced to the semi-finals 
today of the NCAA Division III 
Nationals at Jackson, Missis-

-s ipp i by d efea ti ng the 
tournament's number one seed,

and Chuck Warshaver of 
Williams College 4-6, 6-0, 4-6. 
The Triton doubles team was

Athletes of the Month 

.Batsman, Cyclist 
Get April Honors 

By Karen Hunter 
Sports E dilor 

A woman cyclist who" has no 
fear" and a baseball player 
who batted .500 for thc month of 
April have been selected as 
April's Athletes of the Month. 

CYCLING 
By "quiet example" Warren 

junior Susan VanGundy has 
led UCSD to an extremely 
successful season as the team's 
top female cyclist. 

"She en ters ra ces , rides 
hard, and wins, leaving an 
impressive effect on the rest of 
the team," commented cycling 
coach Dean Patterson. 

" The guys have really helped 
me," VanGrundy commented. 
"In this sport the men are so 
much better than the women, 
but the guys took time to help 
me work out. 

P atterson remarked, " Sue 
works harder to improve than 
any athlete on our team She 
works so hard, that as a coach 
I'm sometimes afra id to let her 
continue - she never quits ." 

VanGundy had a victorious 
pring ea on, winning two 

race and placing second in the 
prestigious NCAA Western 
United States Intercollegiate 
Championships. The cyclist's 
two wins came in the women's 
division of the Claremont 
Criterium and the UC Santa 
Barbara Criterium. 

"I don' t know any other 
competitive women cyclists at 
UCSD," Van Gundy remarked. 
"You have to be weird t6 do it. 
Racing is very draining." 

A Chemistry major, Van-
Gundy says that to train she 
" rides with really good 
people." To keep in shape over 
the summer she plans to enter 
the Red Zinger, an eight day 
tage race in Colorado from 

July 21-29 . 

BASEBALL 
Jon Di ckinson 's sea on 

batting average placed him 
among the best in the NAIA 
Southern Division this spring, 
ending with a .380, the best on 
the Triton squad. 

Not bad considering that 
Dickinson never got mucl1 
playing experience at UCSD in 
the past. He was cut from the 
team in his freshman year but 
according to former coach Lyle 
Olsen's policies, was allowed to 
remain with the team for 
workouts, playing in only a few 
games the entire season. The 
same thing happened in his 
sophomore year so Dickjnson 
didn' t even bother to try out in 
his junior year. He made the 
team this year in a starting 
position. 

"This was my last year to 
give sports a whirl," Dickinson 
remarked. " I was sorry I didn't 
continue as a sophomore and 
junior - I feel I missed a lot. " 

Dickinson commented that 
he owes his season' success to 
.. a lot of hard work and help 
from my teammates and 
coach , but definitely not from 
clean living." 

Coach Vince Askey re -
marked that "Jon's ha rd work 
and dedication have finally 
paid off. " 

Askey cited Dickinson '" 
leadership qualities as part Jf 
his outstanding performance 
for April. "Jon 's leadership 
qualities are two-fold: he 
always takes charge when 
something needs to be done to 
spark the team up and most 
importantly, everyone on the 
team has a genuine re pect for 
his ability and desire to win ." 

Askey feels that Dickinson's 
graduation and absence from 
the team next year will make 
his job as coach a lot harder.

Special Report: Affirmative Action

B}' JOII Goetz 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ever since Allan Bakke became 
the focus of a nationwide debate 
over affirmative action programs, 
the University of California has 
been thrown into an arena of public 
scrutiny a nd concern. 

Last June the US Supreme Court 
ruled that the Regents or the 
University must a dmit Bakke to the 
UC Davis Medical School. In a 
divided agreement , the court ruled 
that the Davis policy of 
automatical ly restricting 16 
percent of its enrollment to 
minority students violated the 1964 
Civil Rights Act.

EOP Encourages Low Income 
Applicants, ·Smooths Way to UC 

By Steve Sclllleider 
S&aIf Wri&er 

Out of the 1400 students who 
have enrolled at UCSD through 
the Education Opportunity 
Program, approximately 70 
percent are minorities, 
accordllll to EOP Director 
William Byrd, 

EOP was established here to 
assist students from minority 
and low Income backgrounds in 
admission procedures. The 
program persuades the 
Director of Admissions to 
waive admission requirements 
for up to six·and·a·half percent 
of the entering class, said Byrd. 

AccoJ:ding to Byrd, students 
who apply for admission 
through EOP are given 
specially marked applications. 
Once received, the applications 
are checked for mistakes that 
would result in the rejection of a 
sttlldellt, Byrd said. In addition, 

applicants of qualifications 
that are not met, and suggests 
ways in which the deficiencies 
may be dealt with, Byrd added. 

UCSD's EOP program, 
similar to other programs in 
the country, began in 1968 with 
the admission of 10 students. 
Currently about 1,400 students 
enrolt in the university through 
the program, Byrd said. 

Each year the program 's six 
recruiters visit from 450 to 500 
high schools and community 
colleges, traveling as far north 
as Sacramento, Byrd said. 
They present what Byrd called 
a "road show, " informing 
students about all aspects of 
UCSD. 

According to Byrd, the 
program tries to make the 
information available to those 
students who "would probably 
not otherwise have access to

minority and lower income 
students tend to " talk 
themselves out" of going to UC 
schools. They automatically 
assume that they lack either 
the academic qualifications or 
the financial capacity to attend 
one of the universities, he said. 

It is the job of EOP, Byrd 
said, to talk minorities into 
going to college. EOP informs 
them about admission , 
housing and financial aid, and 
provides help in overcoming 
difficulties in these areas. 

Funding for EOP comes from 
both registration fees and 
systemwide monies: 

In addition to the recruiting 
program, EOP operates a 
"Partnership Program" which 
reaches out to minOrity and 
lower income junior high school 
students in the San Diego area. 

The objectives of the 
Partnership Program are to 

students in school and to 

inform them of the admission 
requirements at UCSD, Byrd 
said. " It is possible to lose 
eligibility in eighth or ninth 
grade," he remarked, 

According to Byrd , the 
Partnership Program also tries 
to "a ttack the parent 
problem." He said that many 
parents do not know the 
difference between classes that 
fulfill college admission 
requirements and those which 
do not. By providing parents 
with information , EOP hopes to 
help prevent junior high 
students from losing their 
eligibility to attend UC schools. 

Byrd believes that the role 
played by EOP and similar 
programs elsewhere is 
becoming more important 
because the non·mandated 
counseling and career 
programs at public schools 
were the first hit by budget cut· 
backs due to tion 13.

Special Report: Affirm'ative Action 
SAAC: Minority Rights Voice 
First of its Kind in UC 
Frustrated. in Mission 
By John Hondro 

Associate News Editor 
UCSD's Student Affirmative 

Action Committee was " the 
first affirmative actio n 
organization of its kind in the 
UC system - in fact, it was one 
of the first in the country," 
acco rding to Francisco 
Estrada, former member of 
SAAC. 

SAAC , in its third year of 
existence, defines itself as a 
vehicle for promoting the rights 
of minority students at UCSD. 

" If SAAC didn 't already exist 
here, it would have to be 
created ," says Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage . " It 's extremely 
important that minority 
student organizations are not 
divided. They need to move 
together. " 

SAAC, a n advisory commit· 
tee to A rmitage, is composed of 
six representatives from the 
Asian American Students 
Alliance , Black Students 
Union , Disabled Students 
Union. MEChA, the Native 
American Students Alliance 
and the Women 's Center. 

The representatives are the 
voice of each organization, 
representing their constitu-
encies ' particular needs and 
desires , according to SAAC 
Chair Eloy Villa. 

"George Murphy, who was 
vice chancellor of student 
affairs at that time, was deeply 
involved with setting up a 
student affirmative action task 
force; the task force eventually 
turned into SAAC, " explained 
Estrada. 

SAAC was established here to 
insure student enrollment 
based on equal opportunity and 
non·discriminatory criteria, 
according to the committee's 
policy and procedure manual. 

SAAC is designed to be an on-

going program, composed of "a 
series of positive and 
coordinuted activities , in order 
to bring to the campus and 
sustuin an integrated student 
population, " the manual states. 

The Chancellor i respon ible 
for the implementation of all 
a pects of the CSD SAAC 
program. 

"Discrimination Persists" 

According to Armitage, "A 
lot of money is going toward 
bringing in minority students; 
SAAC sees to it that their rights 
a re protected." 

However, committee mem-
bers believe th at SAAC has not 
become visible to the 
a dministration. 

" Within the last 10 years, the 
s ituation for Chicano has 
steadily worsened at UCSD," 
remarked Estrada . " While the 
number of Chicano students 
has gone up , the overall 
percentage has dropped from 
six percent in 1972 to the 
present four percent. " 

Estrada added that the 
number of Chicano faculty 
members at UCSD has gone 
"way down. " 

In addition, Villa commented 
that there are only eight Native 
American students at UCSD 
because "this school offers 
them nothing. " 

Estrada said that ethnic 
discrimination persists at the 
university because " they don't 
take us (SAAC) seriously." 

According to Villa, the 
committee is presently 
working to eliminate this 
problem by putting together a 
"grievance procedure, " 

" Right now, when a student 
comes to us with a complaint of 
discrimination, we don't have

legitimate s teps to follow - we 
don 't know exactly what todo," 
said Villa. 

SAAC also has its conflicts 
with the Associated Students. 
" SAAC has been working to get 
a representative on the AS 
council (at present, the SAAC 
Chair is a non·voting officer) , 
but as far as they're concerned, 
we do not represent the student 
body and, therefore, do not 
merit a voting representative," 
said Villa. 

In order to make the general 
student body aware of 
affirmative action issues , 
"(SAAC) is going to have to 
establish a better working 
relationship with the AS," said 
Villa. "We need to have more 
than a token officer," he added. 

SAAC receives an annual 
budget of a pproximately 

$40,000 from the Registration 
Fee Committee, some of which 
is used to hire student interns. 

EOP and the Student Health 
Center are the units being 
monitored by SAAC interns this 
year. "The purpose of the 
internships is to see how these 
programs are fulfilling their 
goals in relation to affirmative 
action," said Villa . 

In addition, a programmatic 
budget, designed to promote 
the issues and concerns o( 
affirmative action students to 
the general student body, was 
implemented in fall of 1978, 
according to Villa. 

Along with funding program-
matic interns , SAAC co-
sponsors such events as the 
Cinco de Mayo celebration, 
Chicano graduation and 
Malcolm X Day.

Construction Near Glider 
Port Gets Board Approval 

By Kathy Hurfer 
AS!lOCiale News Editor 

Plans for construction on 
both the stables property and a 
stretch of land bordering 
UCSD's glider port and a 
recommendation to retain the 
university's knoll property all 
received endorsement Wednes-
day from the Board of 
Overseers. 

In three separate voice votes, 
the Board overwhelmingly 
passed the recommendations 
during their final meeting of the 
year. 

If Chancellor McElroy 
supports the Board's recom-
mendations, as expected, he 
will submit the proposals to the 
Regents for preliminary 
approval. 

University retention of the 
knoll property, a 25-acre area 
located off of La Jolla Shores 
Drive, received unanimous 
Board support after almost no 
debate. 

Known especially for its 
archeological importance, the 
knoll area will be placed under 
the protection of the uni -
versity's Natural Land and 
Water Reserve System if the 
Board ' s recommendation 
receives Regental support. 

A conference center, to be 
owned and operated on 
university-leased land, was 
also strongly supported by 

the Board despite initial 
concern by several members 
that the center would be used 
for commercial profit instead 
of for university functions . 

But McElroy, an ex-officio 
member of the Board, assured 
members the university would 
make certain that whoever is 
chosen as contractor will 
understand the center is to be 
used primarily for academic 
purposes . 

The most contested issue the 
Board discussed concerned the 
conversion of UCSD's stable 
property into an area for 

co mmercia l a nd hou si ng 
development. 

Acquired by the Regents in 
1967 to be used for academic 
pu rposes , the sta ble area would 
be better suited for private 
development in light of a 
reduction in UCSD's original 
student enrollment estimates, 
according to McElroy. 

While the Board appeared to 
support this contention, several 
members argued that ' UC 
should sell the property instead 
of retaining it for leasing 
purposes. But after discussion, 
the Board voted to accept the 
leasing arrangement with only 
one dissenting vote. 

Overseers: Town to Gown 
Since the 1973-74 academic year, the UCSD Board of 

Overseers has provided community input and advice to 
Chancellor William McElroy on non-academic issues faced by 
the university . 

The Board consists of 39 community members who serve one-
year terms at McElroy's invitation a nd eight "ex-officio" 
members directly associated with the university . 

According to P aul West, director of Public Information here, 
the Board in<;! ludes such " influential" citizens of the San Diego 
community as Theodore Giesel. better known as " Dr. Seuss ." 

The Board was formed to increase community awareness of 
UCSD, to provide a means for citizens to make valuable 
suggestions to the university and to act as a " catalyst" to 
improve the relationship between the university and the 
community, according to goals set by Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Saltman in 1973 .

So it was with apprehension 
that I approached Jast Sunday's

at the Sports Arena. In the three 
and a half years since the "Win,

I was unprepared for what-i

the front of the Southern Wave. 

Only two things marred the 
pf>l'formance - horr ible 
equalization of the sound 
system early in the show and 
Gregg Allman's mumbled 
introductions of the band 
members - so unclear it 
obscured the na mes of the two

old tunes that weren 't really 
possible with the double

that included Chuck Leavel, 
songs like "Whipping Post," 
"Statesborough Blues" and "In

The third and final encore of 
the evening concluded with 
"May the Circle Be Unbroken," 
which featured Bramlett and 
brought guitarist Elvin Bishop,

Big bimbo heads Communal Review 
W hat sort of man can poke fun at America's search 

ror enlightenment in the 
same breath that he's selling a 
new spiritual credo? 

The sort of man who thinks 
the best mantra is laughter, 

trips when there was a big 
stockholder changeover and 
everyone got fired , including 
me. 

"I took of for Mexico for a 
while and wrote some songs 
about it, which began to evolve 
into something else sur-

He wrote a vaudeville-
comedy-musical production 
called " The Bimbo Revue," 
which ran for about two weeks 
last summer in Encinitas ' La 
Paloma Theater. 

" I had no real intention of 
starting a theater group - an 

"I had no real intention of starting a theatre group· ... Ijust 
wound up with 15 people ... There have been no auditions" 

and wbo finds an odd 
assortment of characters 
lnhabitint the comers of his 
mind as well as his house might 
do tbat, if that man were Jack 
Barnard. 

ongoing repertory companY-1 
just wound up with 15 people, " 
Barnard said. There have been 
no bimbo auditions, either, the 
former football player noted. 

Shaking his dark hair away 
from his eyes, he smiled and 
said, " I ' ve just taken the 

full play, so I sat down to write 
it - I expected to have it done in 
a month or so, but it took three 
months, and then I had five 
hours worth of play . In the 
meantime, though , we had 
continued doing ource work 
and process rehearsa ls, so we 
could just pick it up and go with 
it ." 

That "source work a nd 
process" are the root of the 
bimbo theatrical philosophy -
and indeed the root of bimbo. 

Much of it seems to come 
from Barnard 's experience 
with Sufi theater in Boston. 

"In Sufi theater, " the big 
bimbo explains , "there is no 
real concentration on perfor-
mance . It's sort of like 
psychodrama - one is flushing 
oneself out. The characters 

will wear. But there are a 
thousand J ack Barnard in ide 
me , all wearing the sa me 
c lothes, voice a nd actions . I'm 
one thing to you , and an entirely 
different person to anyone el e. 

" By getting in touch with 
those parts of myself. I can 
create a rea l chara cter. When I 
go on in bimbo as Brother Bob. 
I'm not thinking about what 
Brother Bob will do , I am 
Brother Bob. 

"As a matter of fact the more 
mental we are on stage, the less 
:-ve communicate ." 

Barnard 's philosophy seems 
to work for his bimbos - who 
come from many age groups 
and social backgrounds , and 
who maintian their indi vidual 
differences while peacefully 
coexisting at the ranch. 

Tbe 37-year-old Barnard is 
the unintentional father figure 
for a new age communal 
theater ,roup which has taken 
its name Crom its fj rst 
production, "bimbo," which 
played last night in Mandeville 
Center. His troupe oCten refers 
to him as "the big bimbo," but 
he's not really sure how it all 
happened. 

rounding this character 
Captain Uncle Barney," he 
said. "It took seven years to 
complete, and I wound up with 
a 1500 page character 
exploration for a multi-media 
concept which mixes satire 
with metaphysics. I came back 
to San Diego to put a house 
together so we could make 
something of a Captain Uncle 
Barney." 

That house, a rambling ranch 
in Carlsbad's back country, 
became the eventual bimbo 
House - severa l buildings 
housing many of the 15 bimbos, 
and providing a quiet, isolated 
rehearsal space. 

" ... there are a thousand Jack Barnard's inside me, all 
wearing the same clothes, voice and actions." 

"I guess you have to go back 
about 10 years," Barnard said 
in an interview earlier this 
week. "I was the station 
manager, then later president 
of the chain which owns KRPI 
radio. I was well on my way to 
one of those 'the youngest ever' 

The play "bimbo" (which is a 
multi -media revue mixing 
satire with metaphysics) came 
out of Barnard's desire in 1978 
to "get out there and do 
something. " 

energies which were delivered 
to me and worked with them." 

The energies seem to have 
become bigger than the 
individuals, for before the 
Revue had even completed its 
run, Barnard was bombarded 
with requests for more bimbo.

Ballet Coming to Teach, 
Share Campus Facilities 
(Continued from page I ) 

Through the drama depart-
ment. which will offer the 
cIa e, faculty a nd tudents 
a lso will be able to assist the 
co mpany in the d sign and 
technical aspects of the ba llet 
productions . 

Sharing faci liti es a nd 
services will reduce production 
costs for the fin ancially ai ling 
ballet company and allow it to 
charge lower admission prices. 
Martin maintains that the 
connection with the drama 
department is an " ideal 
situation. " 

The phy s ic a l education 
department. which a lready 
offers a variety of courses in 

dance, has a positive atti tude 
about the contract with the Sa n

work together as a cam pus," 
instructor Margaret Marshall 
says, a dding th at the courses 
will be " great for students." 

While Marshall is glad that 
ballet is expanding on campus, 
she is annoyed that neither she 
nor the department chairman 
Howard Hunt was informed oC 
the deci ion, ma de by the ballet 
company a nd the drama 
department. 

"The first I heard oC it was in 
the Tribune where they said, 
' ballet ha d never been taught at 
UCSD,' .. Marshall sai ll. 

According to Marshall , ballet 

has been offered by th P.E . 
department for four years. with 
a current enrollment of 500

added that a ll the instructors 
have advanced degrees and

Brown Wants UC Out of Weapons Lab 
(Conlinued from page 1) 
weapon serves as a deterrent." 
UC Student Body President's 
Council representative Kathy 
Taylor .sked the Regents-not to 
rega 'rd the Buchsbaum 
Committee's report "as 
gospel." She pointed out that 
six of the Committee's 15 
members flied a minOrity 
report, protesting the "speed, 
secrecy, and lack of public. 
input with which the Commit-
tee carried out Its Investiga-
tion." 

Regents were told that had the 
new, tougher admissions 
standards been in effect this 
year, 211, or 1.7 percent of the 
12,374 1978 freshmen would 
have been ineligible for 
admission. 

UC Vice President Donald 
Swain and Assistant Vice 
President Alice Cox said the 
new standards, which place 
more emphasis on Scholastic 
Aptitude Test scores and less on 
high school grade point 
averages, would have had the 
effect of making ineligible for 
UC admissions no whites and 

36 Blacks , 30 Asians , 18 
Chrcanos , two American 
Indians, and one Latino, a total 
of 87 minority students. 

At UCSD , 22 out of 1610 
admitted freshmen would have 
been ineligible under the new 
requirements. Of those 22, 16 
are white , two are Black, one is 
Chicano, and one is Latino. Two 
declined to state their race. 

The new standards will not 
take effect until next fall . 
Regent Renee Tu rkell , 
protesting the Regents' 
decision of last year to toughen 
the standards said, " It's well 

known among scholars that the 
SATs are biased against 
minorities. Anytime you apply 
a single formula to different 
groups , you ' ll h ave a 
disproportionate impact." 

College Entrance Examina-
tion Board Chair John 
Pltminger denied the tests are 
biased agai nst minorities, 
saying that " although evidence 
indicates that minorilies score 
lower on the tests , the tests 
combines with high school 
GPAs can predict students' 
a bility to do university-level 
work. " 

Pitminger added that ·· if you 
lower a dmission sta ndard to 
let more minority students in , 
you will , in the process, let in 
more marginal m aj ority 
students ... 

The Regents also approved 
yesterday a proposal to set 
aside nine ac res west of North 
Torrey Pines Road near UCSD 
as a conference center. The 
University intends to lease the 
area Cor 55 years, renting it out 
to organizations wishing to use 
it. 

The Regents ' me eti ng 
concl udes today. 

Taylor told the Regents .that 
If they do not make a decision 
on whether to !lever ties with 
the labs by the end of today's 
session, "there will be people 
here who will non-violently. 
demonstrate by askllll you to

Other than Saxon, Relents 
who support the University'S 
mana,ement of the labs 
remained silent yesterday. 
Only William Wil8On, Special

Cbair, spoke up, .. idOl Brown

In other developments, the

at a better efficiency rate than 
in almost any other institu-
tion ." He added , "Unfor-
tunately, some lab classes are 
too crowded, and this can lead 
to an impatient p.erson 
performing an experiment at 
their bench when they should be 
using a hood. In such situations, 
it is very Important that each 
person in a lab diligently sticks 
to the prescribed safety 

procedures ." 
Jay Rosenberg, Revelle 

junior in chemistry, believes 
that the beginning lab courses 
were much less safe because of 
student inexperience. 

" I was shocked about the 
unsafe conditions I saw last 
quarter. Everyone seemed to 
know about safety, but no one 
practiced it!" He explained 
that people would either crowd 
hood areas, or do potentially 
dangerous reactions out in the 
open. " Or, people would be 

using open flames right next to 
a flammable chemical," he 
said, adding, " Fortunate ly , 
things have improved greatly 
this quarter, at least Crom what 
I've seen." 

Rosenberg expressed hopes 
that if the safety situation was 
publicized, fewer people would 
get careless in their lab 
practices. 

Bill Lee, a graduate student 
and lab TA, Celt that some lab 
courses were more hazardous 
than others simply .because of 

what was taug ht. "Last 
quarter ," Lee said, " I TA 'ed a 
synthesis lab,with huge batches 
oC chemicals. Thi s quarter 
we're doing a na lytical work, 
and even just because oC 
smaller quantities used, safety 
is easier to come by ." 

Lee agreed that many 
haza rds were magnified in risk 
because of human error. As a 
course would progress through 
the quarter, both the students 
and the instructors would tend 
to relax their safety guard. Body Found i'n Sand 

Of Torrey Pines Beach Keating Cares About Clients 
Saa Dle,o police yesterday were lnve8U,atlnl the pouible 

murder of aa llllidentilled YOWll man whOR body was found 
partially buried in the and of Torrey Pines State Beacb 200 feet 
south 01 the DelMar dty line. 

The victim appeared to bave been shot' near the right eye, 
according to Patrolman Rickey Slocum, first officer on the 
scene, However, the coroner's office has not yet confirmed the 
cause of death. 

Del Mar resident Jim Weseman, 29, discovered the body at 
7: 30 am yesterday while blcycUng to work, according to police 
department spokesman Clyde Leech. Weseman told police that 
he found the body lying face up, partially buried in the sand 
below the hilh tide line. 

A UCSD student who drove by the investigation scene eariy 
yesterday told The Guardian that he had seen a pool of blood in 
the parking lot, with a trail leading toward the beach. There 
were drag marks in the sand to the high tide line, he said. 

The Incident remains under investigation by the 
department's Homicide Division and the Coroner's o(fice, 
Leech said.

how to deal with partners in
