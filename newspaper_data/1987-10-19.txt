University sued 
by fired RA 
By JOHN SHAW 
T raininll Director 

A former Third College resi-
dent advisor sued the University 
of California in Small Claims 
Court Friday for damages that 
resulted from his unjustified term-
ination last February_ 

Bill Madsen , a Third College 
senior, was fired by Resident 
Dean Yolanda Trevino at the 
Third College semi-formal when 
he removed his dress slacks to 
reveal the pair of bermuda surf 
short he was wearing under-
neath . 

After fi~ng several formal com-
plaints against the resident 
dean's office, Madsen's termi-
nation was rescinded and he 
was awarded in June of this year 
$1,550.41 in back pay. Mad-
sen claims that his termination 
caused him to drop several 
classes which will force him to 
attend an additional quarter to 
graduate. He i currently suing 
the University for $1,500 in ' 
onsequential damages. 

Judge James L. Duchnick 
heard the case Friday afternoon, 
but failed to hand down a deci-
sion pending additional review. 
Termination 

On Friday Feb. 20, Madsen 
and another resident advisor, 

Dave Kritzer , wore colorful, 
knee length bermuda shorts un-
derneath their sracks to the semi-
formal at the Marriott Hotel. At 
about 11 :45 pm, the two re-
moved their slacks on the dance 
floor and danced in their shorts 
in full view of the resident dean's 
table for approximately 10 min-
utes. 

"The resident dean, Yolanda 
Trevino, approached me, put 
her arm around me, smiled and 
said, ' Bill , you're fired .' I 
responded, ' Really?' and she 
said, 'Yes, you're fired,'" Mad-
sen wrote in his first formal 
complaint against the resident 
dean's office . 

According to Madsen, T re-
vi no then went over to Kritzer, 
told him he was also fired and 
left the dance. Kritzer put his 
slacks back on, Madsen did not. 

Kritzer and Madsen menti-
oned to the resident dean and an 
assistant resident dean on the 
afternoon of the dance that they 
planned to wear bermuda shorts 
to the semi-formal. According 
to Kritzer , Assistant Resident 
Dean Jim Nauls called him at 
4:30 pm and informed rum that 
the Marriott had a dress code. 

" He asked me what I was 
wearing to the semi-formal. I 
told him a jacket and a tie. He

Kritzer both claim that Nauls 
did not contact Madsen prior to 
the dance. 

In the second appeal that 

Madsen requested , the resident

Armed 
robbery in 
parking lot 
By TINA LUCAS 

Friday, October 16, at approx-
imately 1 :30 am, a student was 
robbed a t gunpoint as he entered 
his car in lot 101, adjacent to Urey 
Hall. 

Adam Lieb was returning from 
the rec . gym, where he is employed 
as a referee. As he unlocked the 
door of his red , '79 Ford Pinto , he 
observed a man approaching him . 
from the direction of the bus stop on 
North Torrey Pines Road . Lieb 
had just sat down in his car when 
the suspect - a male of Middle 
Eastern appearance, approxi -
mately 5'7" walked up to the car, 
pointed a semi-automatic in hi ' 
face and demanded that Lieb hand 
over ~i money. 

Upon obtaining the tudent' wal-
let , the suspect then noticed the car 
keys in the ignition and ordered the 
student to get out of the vehicle and 
"take off ." As Lieb fled the 'cene 
for assistance, he glanced back and 
saw his car headed northbound on 
North Torrey Pines Road _ 

Trying first the Revelle resident 
dean' . office, but finding it clo ed , 
Lieb then sought assistance at Blake 
Hall, where he called the police. 
The Police were, however , unable 
to apprehend the suspect. (g 

Study indicates westernization at Africa a failure 
By DAVID SALISBURY 

SANTA BARBARA - Africa. 
Today, the prevailing western 
images of the "dark continent" are 
ones of death a nd hopelessness. 
The media repeatedly retail pic-
tures of explosive population 
growth, famine , disease, ecological 
destruction, debt and corruption. 

However, a 17 -year study of 
one area in eastern Kenya suggests 
that this stereotype is overdrawn 
and overly pessimistic. 

The results of this work - sup-
ported primarily by the National 
Science Foundation - will be pub-
lished next year in a two-volume 
work " Plants and People: Social 
and E ological Change in Mbeere, 
Kenya" by the University Press of 
America . 

drier parts which extend down to 
the Tana, Kenya's major river. 

In 1906, when the area was 
formally brought under British rule, 
the total population was less than 
15,000. The people lived in small 
tha tched houses made of poles and 
mud. They raised chickens, goats 

"Our inquiries clearly show an 
area whIch, while undergoing pro-
found change ' and facing formida-
ble problems, is by no means in a 
hopeless situation," says David 
Broken:-.ha, professor of anthro-
pology and environmental studies 
at the University of California, 
Santa Barbara. 

With geographer Bernard Riley , 
a lecturer in environmental studies 
at UCSB, Brokensha has just con-
cluded an in-depth study of the 
Mb ere, one of the smaller ethnic 
groups in Kenya who live about 
100 mil s northeast of Nairobi . 

Mbeere women hand -ginning cotton. a cash crop In Kenya 

Today , about 80,000 Mbeere 
occupy 620 8quare mIles of land . 
The region includes the foothills of 
Mount Kenya which have rich 'oil 
and support a dense population . 
But most of th people live in the

and cattlf' . 
However, 1970 wa a turning 

pomt for the region, according to 
Brokensha and Riley. 

That was th year when the 
government ,b gan privatising the 

land. And a major development 
program - financed by Norway 
and implemented by the Kenyans 
- was initiated with the goal of 
building more roads , providing 
water to most of the population , 
encouraging cash crops (cotton and 
tobacco) and generally facilitating 
economic development and rai 'ing 
agricultural productivity. 

These forces interacted in com -
plex ways to produce rapid and 
profound social and ecological 
changes: 

• Traditional, communal Mbeere 
culture virtually di 'appeared, re-
placed by aociety oriented around 
the nuclear family. 
• Major changes in agriculture 

took place the Mbe re began to 
shift from subsistence to cash crops. 
• Rapid deforestation has created 

a serious shortage of fuel wood and 
native building material '. 

ocial inequalitie ' have increased 
significantly . Disproportionate 
numbers of women and elderly are 
among the impoverished . 

According to Brokensha and 

Riley, their study clearly demon-
strates the inadequacy of "top 
down " development schemes of 
Western (or Western-trained) ex-
perls. 

For example, an extensive water 
project failed becau 'e maintenance 
proved too difficult and expensive. 

Repeated problems and failures 
of this sort each an important les-
son. Says Brokensha , " If you want 
to improve agricultural produchon', 
then you must start with what the 
people actually do and know. 
Efforts to simply transplant western 
methods and te hnology do not 
work." 

As an example of the "bottom 
up" approach that he and Riley 
conSIder essential the 'cientists point 
out that the older Mbeere have a 
surprisingly detailed and complete 
knowledge of their natural envir-
onment. Combining this "indigen-
ous knowledge . stem" with the 
power of we ·tern 'cience holds 
considerable promise, they say . 

The major obstacle i' the preJu-
dice of Western-trained official ' 
and experts , they say . (g

Tips offered for 
Alcohol Awareness Week 

The organizers of National Collegiate 
Alcohol Awareness Week, occurring 
Oct. 19·25, have offered a number of 
survival tips that they hope may save 
lives: 
• Never drive after drinking -whether 

you've had beer, wine or distilled spirits. 
• Eat something; never drink on an 

empty stomach. Eat before you go to a 
party and while you are there. Solid food 
can help slow down the alcohol absorp-
tion rate. 
• Don't be pushed into drinking more 

than you can handle and don 't pressure 
your friends to keep up with you. Eve-
ryone has an individual tolerance. 
• Know yourself and your mood . If you 

rarely drink , chugging a few beers will 
al/ect you faster than it would allect 
someone who is accustomed to drinking. 
Your mood can influence the way you 
react to a drink. 

Women's roles in modern 
university to be discussed 

In conjunction with the City of San 
Diego's Women's Opportunity Week, the 
UCSD Women's Caucus will present, on 
Monday, Oct. 19, a panel discussion by 
UCSD women. Dr. Nan Bray of Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography, will be 1 of 
the 9 panelists. Admission is free and 
open to the public in III A Chancellor's 
Complex at 4:30 pm. Refreshments will 
be served at 4 pm. 

Chancellor's Assocociates 
honor three UCSD faculty 

A mathematician, a sociologist and a 
bioengineer have been named winners-of 
the University of California, San Diego's 
Chancellor Associates Awards for teach-
ing, research and community service . 
The annual awards consist of $1,000 
and a certificate of exc~lIence . 

AI Manaster , professor of mathemat-
ics, won the Outstanding Community 
Service Award; Yuan-Cheng Fung, pro-
fessor of applied mechanics and engineer-

BLOOM COUNTY 

ing sciences, was named outstanding 
researcher; and Tim McDaniel , associate 
professor of sociology, won the award for 
outstanding teaching. 

Manaster's award singled out "his 
leadership role in working with secondary 
schools in the design and implementation 
of the Mathematics Diagnostic Testing 
Project." The project helps secondary 
and community college teachers measure 
students' abilities in algebra and assesses 
their preparedness for college calculus 
and science courses. Manaster holds a 
Ph .D. from Cornell University and joined 
the UCSD faculty in 1973. 

The award lor outstanding research 
went to Fung , a long time member of the 
applied mechanics and engineering scien-
ces department. F ung has contributed to 
the development of fluid and solid 
mechanics and their applications to engi-
neering, and since 1960, he has concen-
trated on biomechanics, particularly on 
the problems of blood flow. A native 01 
China, Fung earned his Ph.D. in aero-
nautics from the California Institute of 
Technology in 1948, and has been at 
UCSD since 1966. 

McDaniel was honored for "his 
extraordinary contributions to the educa-
tion of students at UCSD" as a member 
of the sociology faculty specializing in the 
Soviet Union. McDaniel joined the 
faculty at UCSD in 1979 after earning 
his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. 

The Chancellor's Associates , which 
began in 1966, is made up of Friends of 
the University who contribute $1,000 or 
more annually lor the discretionary fund 
of the chancellor

Basic theft prevention rules 
outlined for bicycles 

Because UCSD has experienced an 
increased number of bicycle thefts this 
year, campus Crime Prevention Officer, 
AI Jenkins , has suggested these basic 
theft prevention rules. These tips will also 
aid in the recovery of stolen bicycles. 

When selecting a cable or chain to 
secure your bike, make sure it is at least 
6'long. This way, you can secure the 
bike frame and front wheel around a 
fixed object. If you buy a chain, 
remember the heavier the beuer. Larger 
steel links, at least 3/8.inch 01 case har· 
dened alloy steel, provide greater resist· 
ance to culling or prying. 

If you buy a cable, inspect it closely. 
Some manufacturers cut costs by giving 
you less steel and hide the fact with a 
thicker vinyl coating. A cable of 7/16· 
inch steel provides good protection. 
Cables smaller than this can be cut easily 
with ordinary wire cullers. 

Do not be fooled by a manufacterers 
claim of a "burglar proof lock ." There is 
no lock that can withstand an attack for 
a long period of time . A good padlock 
should have at least a 7/ 16·inch har· 
dened alloy steel shackle. Make sure the 
locking mechanism in the padlock is of a 
pin· tumbler construction for added 
security. 

You may want to use a U.shaped lock 
designed especially for protecting bicy. 
c1es. These U.shaped locks can be pur· 
cha»ed at both the campus bike shop and . 
bookstore . Remember a good chain/ca· 
ble and padlock is the best way to pre· 
vent bike theft . 

When possible, attach your bike to an 
immovable object such as a tree, bike 
rack, or light pole, where there is a high 
degree of pedestrian traffic . If someone 
does try to steal your bike, chances are 
they will be seen by passers.by. Make 
sure, however, that you bike is not block· 
ing building entrances or pedestrian 
walkways. 

Fmally, record your bike serial number 
and other identifying bike information on 
the form provided in the new Bicycle and 
Skateboard Rules and Responsibilities 
pamphlet. These pamphlets can be 
obtained at the University Police 
Department. Also, register your bike with 
a California bike license. 

Registering your bike serves as a 
deterrent to thieves and helps the police 
to identify and return found bikes to their 
owners. You may register your bike at 
the University Police Department from 4· 
7pm, Monday through Friday and all 
day Saturday and Sunday. There is no 
charge for this service. 

If you have any questions regarding 
bicycle security, please call Officer Jen. 
kins at 534·3644.

Kritzer said.

the opportunity to presenr her side 
of the issue, but refused, saying , "I 
have been inslructed by my super· 
iors not to comment. The case is 
considered closed as 01 June 30."

Dean Luis Ramirez stated, "When 
we're dealing with an individual 
case where personal privacy is

The two were seen by Trevino 
separately. Madsen entered first. 
After a period of discussion, Mad· 
sen was given written notification 
of termination. The letter stated 
that he: (1) exhibited inappropriate

pardized the role of the resident 
advisors, and (4) defied a staff 
directive.

thing to keep his job. Trevino asked,

RA training] meeting, I saw a rift 
between [Madsen) and [the resi · 
dent deans.] Bill [Madsen] came in 
saying the program was brainwash· 
ing. I think there was more [to 
Madsen 's termination] than this 
incident. This was the straw that 
broke the camel's back ," Kritzer 
said . 

Madsen explained his comment 
by saying, "[ the resident deans) 
ask you to be unrealistic about 
what the students' needs are . . . [for 
example,] the alcohol policy . You 
know s tudents are going to drink . 
That 's part of the college expe· 
rience nowadays. Why not accept 
that students are going to drink and 
deal with it, rather than saying, 
'No. Students are not going to drink 
at all and we're going to make sure 
they don't drink?' It's ridiculous." 
Adminietrative Review 

Under section 730.3 of the per· 
sonnel policy manual, a written or 
oral warning must precede a termi· 
nation "unless it involves disho· 
nesty , theft or misappropriation of 
University property, fighting on Ihe 
job, insubordination, acts endan· 
gering others, or other serious mis· 
conduct." 

Since Trevino gave no oral or 
written warning prior to firing the 
two, and none 01 the exemptions 
had apparently been met , Basil 
concluded that the resident dean 
had failed to follow proper pro· 
cedure. 

By filing for administrative re-
view, Basil hoped Madsen would 
be able to get his job back. The 
problem, however, was that Basil 
knew of no one in the entire UC 
system that had ever filed , let alone 
won, an administrative review. 
After much effort, Basil obtained

NEWS 

the necessary forms and helped 
Madsen to submit them on March 
2, one week after Ihe termination. 

According to University policy, 
the administrative review is first 
forwarded to the immediate super· 
visor of the administrator in ques· 
lion . At the time, Trevino's super· 
visor was Acting Dean Hugh 
Pates. 

" I was in support of the resident 
dean's decision. Dave [Kritzer] was 
evidently apologetic to the situa-
tion. According to Resident Dean 
Trevino, Bill was antagonistic and 
angry with the decision. After dis-
cussing it with her assistants, she 
decided it would be appropriate to 
retain Dave and to dismiss Bill ," 
Pates said. 

Madsen admitted he was upset 
with Trevino's decision and that he 
let her know it. 

"Looking back on it, I was really 
railroaded ," Madsen said . "She 
had no right to fire me at the dance. 
r was steamed and f told them I was 
steamed. r told them I thought the 
decision was ridiculous and that I 
was sorry if r offended them. but I 
didn 't think it merited termination. 
[Assistant Residenl Dean] Jan 
[Sternbach] said, ' I think you've 
got a lot of anger and r think you 
should take some time to think 
about it .' r said, 'You're damn right 
I'm angry, you just fired me ." , 
Independent Party Review 

After Pates made it clear that he 
supported Trevino's decision , Basil 
instructed Madsen to file a second 
appeal to request that an independ. 
ent party from within the University 
hear the case. The request was filed 
April 6, seven week alter Mad· 
sen's termination.

In defense of women ... 
and Vanna White 
Editor: 

While it is clear that Peter Quer-
cia attempted to defend women 's 
rights in his letter to the Guardian 
(Oct. 15 issue), it is also clear that 
he views women , on the whole, as 
fragile and homogenous. Does Mr. 
Quercia feel that these women -
jessicA Hahn, Donna Rice , Vanna 
White, and Tammy Faye Bakker 
- are so powerful that they can put 
an end to all equal rights attained 
since Susan B. Anthony's remar-
kable struggle for women's voting 
rights? 

II so, he must hold the view that 
women, as a whole, are unable to 
fight for their equality in the 1980s. 
He must feel, indeed, that the 
"women of the 80s" are all alike, 
without any diversity or intelligence, 
and that these 4 women have been 
asked - perhaps elected? - as 
spokespeople for an entire genera-
tion . He must have forgotten the 
Rose Birds , the Sandra Day 
O'Connor~, the Margaret Thatch-
ers. 

Women are now allowed the 
choice to be almost anything. This 
is equality. We continue to fight for 
this equality each day . If Mr. 
Quercia believes that all equal nghts 
advances can be erased so easily, 
he must also believe that women 
are indifferent , and unwilling to 
defend these rights_ Phyllis Schafly 
may openly try to reverse women 's 
rights, however, to assert that 
women 's rights can be ruined by 
the actions of a few individuals , Mr. 

Quercia similarly perpetuates the 
myth of women's inferiority to men. 

And what about Vanna White? 
What has site done to destroy 
women's rights? As far as I can tell , 
she is an honest woman (or at least 
as honest as any Hollywood male), 
who has chosen her vocation. 
Would there be equality if, instead 
01 being forced to be housewives, 
as in days past, women were forced 
mto intellectual positions? Equality 
exists only when each person -
man or woman - is allowed to 
choose a vocation on the basis of 
skill and motivation - be it a 
leader, a housewife, a scholar, a 
scandal, or a TV hostess.

Restructuring the co-ops: 
good or bad? 
Editor: 

Thank you for the recent article 
by Eric Vollmer on the 'Business of 
Books at UCSD' (Oct. 15), I found 
the article informative and felt that 
Groundwork was treated with con-
sideration and respect. It was dou-
bly good for us in that we some-
times feel a little in visible over here 
in the Student Center. 

I'd like to provide some clarifica-
tion regarding the leases for the co-
ops /collectives and the University 
Center Board . All the co.ops/col-
lectives have had leases with the 
Student Center Board (now Uni-
versity Center Board) which spec-
ify the amount of rent or debt ser-
vice they pay to the University 
Center . Until this year, the leases 
have been annually renewed with-
out difficulty. This year, the new

REAGAN 'S IlOL.E AS " PEACE MAKEIl ." 

University Center director, Jim 
Carruthers, decided to permit these 
leases to lapse. He made this deci-
sion without the knowledge or con-
sent of either the co-ops/collectives 
or the University Center Board. 

The board was informed of Car-
ruthers attempt to surreptitiuously 
pocket-veto the leases at their first 
meeting, against the wishes of Car-
ruthers . They were also informed 
of the co-ops '/collectives' need for 
protection and stability. They voted 
unanimously to mandate him to 
sign an "agreement" (taking the 
place of the previous lease) ensur-
ing the co-ops/ collectives that they 

would not be removed from their 
respective spaces during this cur-
rent year. 

While a welcome show of good 
faith on the part of the board , this 
action is a preliminary to what 
should prove to be an educational 
experience for us all: the restructur-
ing of the relationship between the 
co-ops/collectives and the univer-
sity, and the altempt to force the 
internal reorganization of the co-
ops/collectives. These organiza. 
tions have existed for many years 
as worker co-ops/collectives, 
meaning that the people who work 
are the ones who make all the deci-

sions. In the case of Groundwork 
this has been since 1973 (Ground-
work moved into the Student Cen-
ter when it was built in 1976). 
Cooperative/collective structure 
provides for the highest levels of 
member participation, education 
and responsibility. 

The internal structures of the co-
ops/collectives and their autonomy 
are now being threatened . There is 
an altempt by the administration to 
redefine the resources of the co-
ops/ collectives as not belonging to 
these groups. Groundwork first 
learned of the conflict between the

administration and the co-ops/col-
lectives in 1983 when we were told 
by now Vice Chancellor Tommy 
Tucker to cease providing course 
books or' face being thrown off 
campus . 

Carruthers is attempting to con-
vince the University Center Boar,d 
that the resources and revenues of 
the co-ops/collectives don' t belong 
to them, and that the board (with 
his assistance) should administer 
them . Carruthers has stated that he 
does not believe that students are 
capable of making sound business 
decisions, and has attempted to 
override the decisions of several co-
ops. The effort to hide the lease 
from the University Center Board 
is typical of his tactics. These threats 
come from the administration; not 
from the student body , faculty, or 
sta ff of the university_ • 

While we have no objection to 
making the already existi ng rela-
tionship between the universily a nd 
the co-ops/collectives more explicit, 
(having) always tried to be respon-
sive to the cri ticisms and sugges-
tions of the university community , 
we must insist upon the maintain-
ing of our essential nature: worker 
control. The members of the co-
ops/collectives must be the ones to 
decide all matters of budgeting , 
personnel , security, and how they 
are run. Any other system is neither 
a co·op nor a collective. Particu-
larly now, with the imminent relo-
ca tion of the Regent's Bookstore 
and the installation of corporate 
entities (Taco Bell , Wendy 's) in the 
University Center, control of the 

co-ops by the University Center 
director would constitute a clear 
confli ct of in terest. 

If you're interested in the Uni-
versity Center Board's project of 
'cla rifying ' our role in the univer -
sity , please attend University Cen-
ter Board meetings every other 
Tuesday at5 pm in the North Con-
ference Room in the Student Cen-
ter. The next meeting is Ocl. 27 . 
We'd like to emphasize that any 
decisions made on the position of 
the co-ops should be made with the 
consensus of all the co-ops/col-
lectives. 

The University Center Board 
still has openings on subcommit-
tees and for faculty and students at 
large. EViln Weisenfeld (chair of 
the board) should be able to give 
you more information on these 
positions. Of course , if you would 
like to be involved in the co-ops, 
please contact the co-op of your 
choice, stop by the co-op office 
upstairs in the student center, or 
stop by and visit with us at one of 
our educational and sociloll events. 

We believe that the co-ops/col-
lectives can peacefully co-exist with 
the new University Center if we are 
allowed that option. While we 
realize the services we provide and 
the environment we create are not 
for everyone, we feel assured of 
broad support of the university 
com munity . We are part of an edu-
cational and intellectual environ-
ment here , which we enhance with 
our cultural and social events, our 
study groups, space for discourse, 
and , of course , literature.

Should the U.S. retaliate against Iran for their recent 
attacks on U.S. flagged tankers in the Persian Gulf? 

0, I was against the U. . flag . 
ging of fo reign tankers in tho' Gulf 
from the beginning. At the mome nt, 
I think that a diplomallc so/uti on 01 
the c rises is still possible and. there· 
fore, a retaliation will be extremely 
dangerous for the stability in the 
Middle East . 

Ye., the V S. , hould retaliate 
against Iran for their recent attacks 
on shipping. Iran keeps attackmg

some way to put a stat> to it.

re taliate in a violent manner be· 
cause it would simply harm i,lno,

Continued from page 3 

The independent reviewer, 
Campus Planning Officer Robert 
Starkey, heard testimony from both 
sides and established the primary 
issue to be whether or not staff per· 
sonnel policy 730.3 was violated 
when Madsen was fired . 

According to Starkey's written 
report, " Mr. Madsen's conduct was 
inappropriate, represented bad 
judgement given the semi-formal 
nature of the dance and knowledge 
of the Dean's wishes, and was 
insubordinate in the strict sense of 
the term ;. however , this behavior 
was not sufficiently serious to jus· 

tify waiver of PPM 730.3 warning 
requirement. .. 

Starkey submitted his report May 
15, nearly three months after Mad· 
sen's termination. One month later, 
Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs Joseph Watson rescinded 
Madsen's termination and awarded 
him all wages lost as a result . 

Madsen was notified June 19, 
nearly four .and·a.half months after 
his termination . 

Basil said he was very excited 
when Madsen won his case. " I 
know exactly how the [administra-
tive review) process goes. /t 's not 
only for termination, but for trans-
fers , salary cuts, performance eva-
luations, abuse, etc. Administra-
tors rely on the fact that students 

don't know there is a way to fight 
it . IJ 
Conaequential Damage. 

According to Madsen, Trevino 
denied him the opportunity to reside 
in the Third apartments through 
finals . During finals week, Madsen 
was ordered to leave. As a result of 
his termination , Madsen took two 
jobs to pay for his room and board 
off campus. Due to scheduling con· 
f1icts, Madsen said he was forced to 
drop two of his classes. 

As a result, his expected winter 
1987 graduation date was pushed 
back to spring 1988. Madsen es-
timates the extra quarter will cos t 
him approximately $2,500 in fees , 
transportation and parking costs, 
and room and board. 

In an effort to receive compensa· 
tion for the expense of having to go 
an extra quarter, Madsen filed a 
formal request, on July 20, with the 
assistant vice chancellor of under. 
graduate affairs, A. W. Russ. Mad· 
sen stated in the letter that he would 
be willing to accept $1,000 in set-
tlement of the entire claim. Mad-
sen added that if the university was 
unable to meet these terms, he 
would have "no recourse but to 
pursue legal action ." 

Madsen 's letter was forwarded 
to Kerry Dennell of the sta ff per· 
sonnel office. Madsen received 
Donnell's reply July 31 stating that 
Vice Chancellor Watson's decision 
was "fair and equitable." Madsen 
subsequently filed suit Sept. 2

against the University. 
Small Claim. 

The University, represented by 
Business Office Manager Vance 
Jahnes-Smith 'and Administrative 
Analyst Marcia Rubish , contended 
in court last Friday that Madsen 
has already been awarded his claim 
and that no further damages will be 
paid . The University argued that 
Madsen had the opportunity to 
seek additional damages during the 
administrative review process. 

Madsen argued that at the time 
of the administrative review he 
didn 't know what the consequential 
damages were going to be. 

Judge Duchnick is expected to 
hand down a decision sOlJletime 
this week. ~

There i~ only one city in the world where you can walk 
down the marble 1I00rs of the U.S. enate a nd overhear Ala n 
Cranston's private views of Pete Wilson, or hike up dozens of 
stairs to see honest Abe's face piercing through the crowd's 

~tare~, or ~ee the Wright brothers ' Killyhawk dangling in 
midair in the Space and Aeronautics Smithsonia n; the city of 
course is ... Washington, D.C., our nation's capitol. 

With the pre~ldential election, only a year away, and the 
Iran· Contra hearings turnlOg the once "tefl on president" IOto 
the now "velc ro president ," where a ll accusations of ques· 
tionable behavior now stick to him like glue - many people 
have been wondenng about the nature of those who occupy 
offices on " the Hill. " Itoo have wondered so when time came 
to do an IOtern~hip, I could notthlOk of any better place to go 
than Washongton , D.C. 

I arrived on the hill with high hopes a nd expectation~, since 
I wa~ going to work with enator Edward M. Kennedy . An 
awarene" of his family a~ legendary , a nd Ted Kennedy , the 
younge,t of the famOlI, brother> a~ actively involved in both

Ob.erving Senator Kennedy In action is fascinating. His 
"tature and ~enionty pub him in the center ring of the legi.la. 
live process . He i. the Chairman 01 the Labor and Human 

Resource~ Committee , Chairman 01 the Immigration a nd 
Refugee Subcommittee, and an influential member of both 
the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees . He has va"t 
political power a nd his jurisdiction encompa"ses a broad 
range 01 i~sues . That Kennedy receives letters not only from 
his conslltuents , but from people all over the nations a nd the 

world (1,000 a day ) is, in itself, suggestive of this political 
power a nd broad influence. 

My intern ·hip duties invol ved researching various legisla. 
tive'bills, answering constituent inquiries, and retrieving from 
the senator's house personal belongings . My main duties were 
centra lized around the Judiciary Committee and the 1m· 
migra tion and Refugeee Subcommittee. I did extensive 
research on a new bill , the Civi l Rights Restoration Act, which 
would enable effective protec tion against sex, race, disability , 
and age di~crimination in federally assisted education pro· 
grams. 

I discovered that "staffers" on Capitol 
Hill do not work banker's hours. I 
often worked 10 hour days. Washing-
ton D.C. is like finals week 52 weeks a 
year. 

Workina for Kennedv, I soon came to realize the power of 
politics. During a Labor Committee hearing regarding the 
Civil Right" bill , Kennedy , using statistics that I had person· 
ally compiled , demonstrated aggressive and persuasive 
speech and debating skills when he explained the vital impor· 
tance of thi s bill , and demanded that effective civil rights 
protection be ensured. I was struck by the realization that my 
input in this major piece of legislation could have an impact on 

thousands 01 people's lives. 
Upon doing the research lor this bill, I discovered that 

"staffers" on Capitol Hill do not work "banker's" hours . I 
often worked I O·hour days because of the importance of the 
civil rights bill and other simultaneous hearings. Washington, 
D.C. is like fianb week 52 weeks a year. 

Senator Kennedy believes in the maximum utilization 01 
time. No moment is wasted. His entire staff has access to him . 
Even as an intern , I was able to speak with him on numerous 
occasions. Kennedy knows the dangers of isolation and , as a 
result, he is always seeking information from staff and 
experts. 

Butlile on the Hill is not all work. Many a Friday night I 
found myself relaxing in an informal staff party with the 
Senator who always appears charming and charismatic. His 
Boston accent still remains strong even though he spends 
much 01 hi s time in Washington , or at his Virginia home 
overlooking the Potomac River. 

Melody Miller, a spokesperson Irom the Kennedy office, 
and who has worked over the past 20 years with President 
John F. Kennedy and presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy, 
said , " I would hope all young people will take time to explore 
opportunities in political headquarters or community services 
a nd reach out to the world outsid .. their own private lil~ ." 
Miller believes that there are many areas 01 great need a nd 
feels that by helping, one will a lways be well .paid in personal 
satislaction and experience. 

Miller also stated that the Kennedy family was a great 
influence on Ted as he was growing up. He would si t with his 
brothers and sisters at the dinner table and discuss national 
and international events . Joe Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald

Kennedy and Ole 
Continued from page 8 
Kennedy made it clear to their children that they were blessed 
to be so fortunate; moreover, that they had an obligation to 
give something back to the country that had given them so 
much. 

All the members of the Kennedy family have tried to 
accomplish this goal. Besides the notable achievements of the 
Kennedy brothers -Joe, Jack, Bobby, and Ted - the 
Kennedy sisters started the Special Olympics lor the handi-
capped. Mrs. Eunice Kennedy Shriver received the Presiden-
tial Medal of Freedom for the Special Olympics last year. 

Spe~ding six months as an intern in Washington , D.C. was 
exciting and has greatly influenced my own life. I urge all 
shlrl""t • . no milll". ",h"t ~'nllr miljor . to "ith"r work or visit 
Washington, D.C. (Washington, D.C. is more than marble 
floors in the Senate, mahogany chairs of the Supreme Court, 
or cherry blossoms along the Potomac River. This city houses 
a collection of the world's finest artifacts stored in the many 
Smithsonial museums, various historical monuments, the 
Library of Congress, the White House, International embas· 
sies, and let's not forget the fantastic parties.) And, whether it 
be to work in or walk through the buildings that house this 
country's seat of political power, should you see Ted Kennedy 
on his way to the Capitol to vote, remember - some young 
intern probably had a hand in forming the senator's decision 
on how he will cast his vote . illI 

Jac:,;e Kermani's work for Senator Kennedy this summer ranged from researching federal bills to picking up 
personal articles from Kennedy's home.

Pink and green neon lIilshes in the nifiht on a , tree t in Hillc res t h!{hting the way to 
the Corvette Dine r, one of the ci ty's 
most happening plac" on a Satur-
day night. It i. only 8 pm and 
already 25 or so people wait near 
the door; a nd they do not seem to 
'mind waiting , even as long as 40 
minutes . Alter a ll , they did not 
come here just to ea t. 

For a bit of '50s nosta lgia, the 
Corvette Diner is a lot more fun 
than "Ozzie and Harriet" rerun •. 

Inside the restaurant, huge 
framed pic tures of the Beatles ha ng 
over the soda fountilin , where boxes 
of bazooka bubble gum are stacked 
next to can. of Hershey '. chocolate 
.yrup. As waitresses in saddle shoes 
bustle about the checkered lino-
leum, the jukebox plays a ,ong by 
Sam Cooke. A 1966 baby blue 
corve tt e is pa rked m the middle of 
the restaurant. Every 3 months or 
sO there'. a different corvette tak -
ing center stage. The cars come on 
loan from regular eu,tomer.. a 
large percentage of whom are gen-
erou, corvette owner,.

tertainment. " Fo r example, note-
worthy on this particular night is a 
ha ndsome, greying bartender who 
looks like he 's ste pped out of a '50s 
TV detecllve series . Also of mter-
esl is a pale man with black eyeliner 
and a white turtleneck swea ter-
leaning against the bar. and a 
blond, pony-tailed youngster blow-
ing out 7 candles from a birthday 
cake . 

The Corvette Diner displays me-
morabilia from a celebrated era: in 
one corner, a revolving Statue of 
Liberty ; an authentic scoreboard 
on the wall beside the likeness of 
James Dean outlined in cherise 
neon; a nd an America n flag . uspen· 
ded from the ceiling. 

" Fine food , quick .erVlce, and 
low prices," reads the Corvette 
Dmer '. matchbook. In the fa st 
paced, economica lly minded '80s, 
what more can you a.k for?

itsell represents nine degrees) . All 
instructors must have some degree 
in the black bell. 

Once a month, members of the 
club can test to move up to the next 
level 01 belt. . The person mUlt

character, self confi-
dence and self-es-
teem," 

-Dan Cripe 
learn 30 to 40 techniques and 
forml a8 well as be able to pass the 
kicking tests. Thil takes place in 
Downey (near L.A. area) with the 
Grand Master presiding and all of 
the other masters (filth degree black 
belt and up) present. 

"Our code 01 ethics is very im-
portant to us, We always try to 
keep it," Cripe said. The moral 
principles which Hwa Rang Do i. 
based on include humanity, justice, 
wisdom, trust, loyalty and courage. 
These qualities are more specifi-
call,. spelled out in five distinct 
codes which have been upheld since 
Hwa Ranll Do.'s origin 1800 years 
ago. The first two codes reler to 
loyalty to one's country and par-
ents; the third code . emphasizes 
trust and brotherhood among 
friends; the next requires courage 
never to retreat in the face 01 an 
enemy; and the last code speaks of 
justice - never to retreat in the 
lace 01 an enemy; and the last code 
speaks of - never to take a lile 
without cause. 

All 01 this seems quite serious 
and intense, but, Dehnert said, 
" We have fun together, we party 
together. Brotherhood is so impor-
tantto us . Most of my bestlriendsl 
met through Hwa Rang Do." 

This past Friday night eight 01 
the 10 martial arts club. on cam-
pus performed in a free exhibition 
in the main gym. Each 01 the clubs 
either performed or brought adem· 
onstration team to let people see 
what makel each club unique from 
another. 

The Hwa Rang Do club plans to 
do another demonstration at the 
end 01 thill quarter. In January is 
the world.wide tournament which 
the UCSD team will compete 
in. ~

Men's soccer wins 
Beats UCSC and Dominican 
to keep playoff hopes alive 

By MATT STEUERW AL T 
Staff Writer 

T he only thing that could have 
gone better for the men 's soccer 
team this weekend was the weather. 
But inspite of the cold a nd wet 
days, the Tritons made it a bright 
weekend by winning games from 
U.C. Sa nta Cruz and Dominica n 
College. 

a turday's game against Santa 
Cruz was a tense, exciting match. 
Neither team could put together 
much of an attack in the first half, 
as both teams had trouble finishing 
off their scoring chances. 

the game looked like It was headed 
for ove rt ime. The Tri tons have had 
their bad experience with O .T . this 
yea r, a nd weren't looking forwa rd 
to another. They mounted another 
series of a ttacks, a nd wi th only 12 
minutes remaining in the game, 
Carrick Brewster found the back of 
the net for the winning goal. 

If Sa turday 's game was exci ting 
because it was close. Sunday's 
match with Domi ni an was excit· 
ing in the same way as Custer's last 
stand to the Indian ' . 

Just like Little Big Horn , it was a 
massacre. 

San Diego finally took the lead in 
the second half on a goal by Pleter 
Koopman. The defense this year 
has played very well, ;'0 the lead 
looked secure. But Santa Cruz 
answered with a goal of their own 
to tie the game . That's when the 
actions really started to pick up . 

The Tritons put pressure on the 
Santa Cruz defense and got a 
corner kick. Mike Kappes hit the 
cornerto Vincent Wong, who drilled 
a beautiful header from way out· 
side into the net for wha t appeared 
to be the go·ahead goal. However, 
the referee took the goal away 
because of a UCSD penalty , so the 
score was still knotted at ).1 . 

UCSD hit Dominican with waves 
a nd waves of attach , passing the 
ball around , over and by the con· 
fused Dominican defense. Carrick 
Brewster started this game as he 
had ended yesterday's, by scoring 
on a Dain DeForest cross onry nine 
minutes into the game . The ball 
actually bounced off a defender 
into the goal, which was as close to 
scoring as Dominican would get. 

Junior Craig Gross slide tackles UCSC opponent during Satu 
match. Tritons won the game, 2-1. 

It seemed tha t this mistake wasn't 
going to hurt when Santa Cruz was 
called for a penalty in the pena lty 
area , giving San Diego a pena lty 
kick . This is usually an automa tic 
goal, but the sho t was missed and 

Ten minutes la ter Brewster got 
his second goal on a volley , with an 
a i t from Scott Rommel. Craig 
Hyde made the score 3·0 when he 
knocked in a pas from Eric Ding-
wall. 

T he half ended quietly after tha t, 
as San Diego couldn 't capitalize on 
a ny more of their cha nces, a nd 
Dominican couldn 't get a shot 
a nywhere nea r the goal. .. 

The second ha lf wa . jus t targe t 
practice for the T ritons. They 

pounded in seven more goa ls from 
every conceivable a ngle. Brewster 
ha d three more goals (to gi ve him 
fi ve for the game) a nd a school 
record. Dingwall fini shed with three 
assis ts, Rommel had two goals, 
a nd Wa llace Whittie r and Mike 
Ka ppes each finished with a goal 
and a n assist. Ka ppes' goal was the 
most impressive of the bunch as he 
curled a corner kick a round the 
front post, over the stunned goalie's 
head , and into the bac k corner of 
the net. To top it off , the Tritons 
had a goa l called back on an 

offsides pena lty . The game ended 
mercifully quickly a t 10·0 . 

After so many close games where 
they have had trouble scoring, it 
was a real relief for UCSD to just 
destroy somebody. This year's team 
came into the season ranked at #5 , 
but has experienced too much 
trouble scoring and losses to Po-
mona-Pitzer and CSU San Ber-
nardino have dropped them out of 
the rankings . This weekend's action 
should he lp put them back into the 
top 20.

Football 
club 
returns 
By FRANK VITALE 

The las t time UCSD had inter-
collegiate football team was 19 
yea rs ago , back in 1868, when 
most of UCSD's .freshman class 
weren't even born yet. But there is 
a movement on this campus to 
bring back intercollegiate football. 
This movement is spear-headed by 
a group of students who formed the 
Triton Footba ll Club la te last fall . 

Last year, a referenda question 
a sking students if they would sup-
port a sma II increa e in the student 
fees to pa y for the cost of a Division 
III footba ll program was put before 
the students in the spring elections. 
The issue caused some controv-
ersy: some students felt that foot -
ball would ruin the a cademic envir-
onment at UCSD, olhers believed 
other intercollegiate sports would 
suffer if a football team came on 
campus. Finally some people jus t 
said plainly that it would never 
pass, that the students of UCSO 
didn't want a football team . But 
they were wrong, the issue passed 
overwhelmingly, almost two·thirds 
majority , 62 percent to 38 percent. 

If the football referenda passed , 
why don 't we have a football tea m? 
Simply because not enough stu-
dents voted . Cris Rys, the president 
of the football club and author of 

"Colleges wanted to 
schedule games 
against us. Cal Tech 
actually had us on their 
official schedule. " 

-Chris Rys 
football club captain 

the referendum , stated "In last 
year's spring elections , almost all 
the A.S. positions went unopposed, 
and students did nol think that 
there was a reason to vote . This 
year will be different. " He went on 
to say, " I don't think people realize 
how close we were to having a 
football team on this campus . Col-
leges wanted to schedule games 
against us, Cal Tech ac tually had 
us on their official schedule." 

Preparations have already begun 
for the possible appearance of 
football . The San Diego Chargers 
are building a locker room adjacent

Water polo wins in overtime 
Tritons top Pepperdine University, 11-1 

By PHIL GRUEN 

In what could possibly be the 
most exciting game of their 1987 
campaign, the UCSO men's water 
polo team overcame a 10-9 deficit 
in the second overtime and con-
verted it into an 11 -10 Triton vic-
tory in sudden death over the Pep-
perdine Waves. Senior Jefferson 
Smith scored the game-winning 
goal, firing the ball past Pepperdine 
goalie lC. Garay one minute and 
42 seconds into the sudden death 

overtime pe riod . 
Including Friday 's 20-5 white-

washing of the Pomona-Pitzer 
Sagehens, the victory improves the 
tenth-ranked Tritons' record to 10-
9, but more importantly , increases 
their chances for a bid to the 
NCAA post-season tournament. 
With the los8, seventh ·ranked 
Pepperdine falls to 11 -9 . 

The estimated 200-plus fans in 
attendance al Canyon view Pool 
Saturday night knew they were in 
for an exciting. high-scoring affair 
right from the start when UCSO's 
Greg Wade bounced a shot along 
the water into the goal on an assist 
from senior Larry Sanders before 
even one minute had expired. Pep-
perdine fought right back, how-
ever, and scored when Aaron 
Chasen 's shol eluded Triton goalie 
Randy Franke to tie the score at 
1-1. It was to be only a few shols 
that would elude Franke's grasp 
during the evening , for he saved a n 
inc redible 18 attempts. 

The two squads traded goals for 
the remainder of the quarter with 
UCSD emerging on top , 3-2. Pep-
perdine had a chance to score in the 
final seconds of the first period, but 
Franke denied Rafael Gandarillas' 
shot as the buzzer sounded. 

the pool (besides the goalie ) because 
sophomore Dave Calder had suf-
fered a kick-out penalty . Calder 
was no slouch on offense, however , 
as he poured in four goals during 
the night to lead the team in the 
scoring department. 

Momentum bega n to s hift 
UCSD's way the latter half of the 
second period , as Calder scored to 
make the score 5 -4 when Pepper-
dine lac ked a man because Ganda-
rillas had been called for a kick·out 
pena lty . On the ensuing posses · 
sions by Pepperdine, both Robbie 
Boyer and Gandarillas managed to 
carve a clear path to the goal , only 
to have Franke thwart both attempts 
as he once again impersonated a 
brick wall in front of the net. Never · 
theless, UCSD was not able to 
score any furthe r and the half 
ended with UCSD trailing Pepper-
dine, 5-4 . 

In the third quarter , the intensity 
of the contest really began to show 
through . Both teams played excep-
tional defen se in this pe riod , a nd 
perhaps a s a result Pepperdine's 
Sasa Poljak almost attacked an 
official after he ejected him from 
the game because of a penalty . The 
coaches from both learns became 
very vocal , and UCSD head coach 
Denny Harper was even issued a 
warning from one official. Calder 
played superbly in this period , scor· 
ing twice and propelling the Tritons 
10 a 7 -6 lead before Pepperdine 
knotted the score at seven at the

to the north campus recreation 
facility that is due for completion in 
June. With the locker room, the 
facility will include an area for a 
track stadium where the UCSD 
football team could play its games . 

Rys said that the club again 
plans to work on a football referen-
dum for this spring's elections. He 
has already had meetings with 
Vice-Chancellor Watson, and Ath-
letic Director Judy Sweet trying to 
resolve some issue problems there 
were last year. He said, "One prob-
lem that hit us last year was a dis· 
agreement over the funding costs 
for a team. I only want to do what 
would be fair for the other sports on 

this campus and not give football a 
lot of bonuses that other sports 
don't have ." 

Asked how he felt about the 
allegation that football would des . 
troy the academic environment at 
UCSD, Rys responded "Stanford, 
Cal Tech, Harvard and Yale seem 
to be doing all right. .. if they can 
have football teams then truly 
UCSD can." 

He went on to say that if anyone 
has any further questions, or is 
interested in getting involved and

Their chance at the playoffs , 
however, remains in doubt. Their 
record is good enough; it's the loss 
to Pitzer which is really going to 
hurt their chances . They have less 
than 10 games left , and need to win 
most (if not all) of them. The 
upcoming game with Claremont is 
the most Important of the year . 
Claremont is a perennial power, 
and the top-rated team on the west 
coast this year . A win against them 
would almost certainly put the 
Tritons over the top into the 
playoffs . 

After this weekend's action, it 
looks like the playoffs are exac.!!l 
where they belong. ~

close of the period. 

UCSD began to take command-
ing control of the game in the 
fourth, and what should have been 
the final period. Thanks to Franke's 
spectacular play in the goal and 
Sanders' two consecutive lICoring 
strike~, the Triton moved to a 9-7 
advantage, their biggest margin of 
the night, with 3:57 remaining. But 
it was not to last. 

The Pepperdine scoring mach-
ines, Gandarillas and Chasen, both 
converted their shot attempts in no 
time at all and tied the lICore at 9-9. 
UCSD's Peter McConville had a 
chance to score as time ran out, but 
his shot was blocked by Garay , 
forcing a couple of three-minute 
overtimes. 

Strangely enough, the two teams, 
who had averaged over two points 
apiece in all four of the regulation 
seven-minute periods, managed to 
score only two points among them 
in the two three-minute overtimes. 
Pepperdine struck first, when Boyer 
whizzed an unassisted goal by 
Franke with 26 seconds left on the 
clock in the initial overtime period 
to make the score 10-9. The Trit-
ons appeared weary as they came 
to the side of the pool at the end of 
the period, knowing they were down 
a goal with only three minutes to do 
something about it. 

Pepperdine appeared to have it 
all in the bag in the waning portions 
of the second overtime, as they 
used the clock effectively and even 

Steve Schatz on give and go 
during the Triton's win. 
became beneficiaries of a power 
play when Calder received another 
kick-out penalty. But Franke, who 
has been busy saving the Tritons 
all night long, aided his team qain 
when he I8Ved another goal attempt 
which could very well have clinched 
the game for Pepperdine_ After a 
time out, Sanders passed to JeHer-
Ion Smith who scored to the delight 
of the predominantly UCSD crowd, 
and tied the game at 10-10 to force 
a sudden death overtime. 

In the sudden death, the ball 
exchanged poNelli~n a couple of 
times before Smith, who not only 
scored the crucial tying goal but led 
the team in allists with four, whip-
ped across the game-winner into 
the net to seal the upset victory for 
the Tritons. 

"It was a very important game 
for our chances of making it to 
post-season play," head coach 
Denny Harper said, as hi. team 
celebrated all around him. "Con-
sidering we beat a team that will 
mOllt likely finish in the top three of 
PCAC (Pacific Coast Athletic Con-
ference), it was an extremely I8tisf-
ying win." 

The Tritons remain tenth-ranked 
nationally in Diviaion III action at 
pre .. time, and will face Cal State 
L.A. on Thunday at 3:30 pm at 
the Canyonview Aquatic Center 
Pool. ~
