All but one of the A,S, 
Council positions will be 
filled by slate members 
Iy MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News EdItor 

The decrease in student voter par-
ticipation in last week's A.S. Council 
elections did not alter the rejoicing 
and cheers last Thursday of 
Independent slate members, who 
were victorious in all but one of the 
nine A.S. campus-wide positions. 

"I think my reaction after they 
announced it spells it all," A.S. 
President-elect Doc Khaleghi said. 
"It is very exciting to know that I had 
the support of undergraduates. What 
is about to come can seem over-
whelming, but I am looking forward 
to it." 

Khaleghl, the founder of the 
Independent slate, defeated fellow 
candidates Ali Yazdi , Derrick Yee, 
Tariq Parwani and SCOlt Mantell. 

Although he credits a lot of his 
success to his slate, Khaleghi said he 
believes other factors contributed to 
his victory as well . 

"I didn't solely count on the slate 
bringing me to victory: he said. "I 
knew I had to get my name out there 
as well. I went into as many student 
[organizationsl as possible, met as 
many people as I could and just tried

UCSD 'Welcomes New 
Admittees to Campus 
5 tudents and parents attended presentations, 
toured campus and spoke with the chancellor 
I, PAlllSA IAIIARIAN 
St aff Writer 

UCSD brought thousands of 
prospective students and their 
families to campus Saturday as 
part of its annual Admit Day. 

Admit Day 2000 began early 
Saturday morning with thou-
sands of admittees attending pre-
sentations on university life, visit-
ing the undergraduate colleges, 
talking with students and faculty, 
and tou~ing the campus to dis-
cover what UCS D has to offer. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes per-
sonally greeted and interacted 
with students and pareJo(s in the 
Price Center Theater, answering 
questions between 8:30 a.ln. and 
10:30 a.m. 

Dynes toid the crowd that 
UCGD i~ the most entrepreneur-
ial and exciting university in the 
country because the campus is so 
young. 

Dynes said that by far, most of 
the concerns he answered were 
about the different colleges. 

"Most of the students and par-
ents were worried about how the 
individual choices of each college 
affect the students," he said. 

Pam Haggins, from the office 
of admissions, said Admit Day is 
beneficial for students and par-
ents. 

"It is an opportunity for stu-
dents and families to get a big 
snapshot of what campus life is 
like, what groups are here and 
about the many student organiza-
tions: she said. 

Eloisa Vasquez, a Roosevelt 
admittee, said she has not decided 
whal university she will be 
attending neJ..'t fall.

Marshall College Holds 
22nd Cultural Celebration 
Event featured booths from various student 
organizations sharing culture and food 
I, PARISA IAHARIAN 
Staff Writer 

Thurgood Marshall's College's 
22nd Cultural Celebration on 
Saturday brought admitted stu-
dents and their families together 
with current students, faculty and 
community members to celebrate 
diversity. 

The cultural celebration fea -
tured a Mariachi band, Chinese 
lion dance, rain dance, games 
from around the world, cultural 
vendors and various cultural stu-
dent organizations. 

Joyce Chastain, an administra-
tive assistant to the Marshall 
dean, said that 23 years ago, the 
cultural celebration was launched 
to unify UCSD's ethnic groups. 

"It started out just as an idea 
to bring different ethnic groups 
on campus together with the 
community to have a big celebra-
tion, and it's grown on its own to 

the size it is today," Chastain said. 
North Scholars Drive was 

packed with student organiza-
tions that shared their culture and 
food. 

Marshall senior Haig 
Boyadjian, event coordinator for 
the Armenian Student Union, 
said his organization participates 
in the event because not many 
people are familiar with Armenian 
culture. 

"They eat our food, they can 
tlip through the books and see 
where our tiny little country is 
located and ask questions," 
Boyadjian said. 

Nancy Magpusao, who 
works at the Cross Cultural 
Center and manned the Pan-
Asian Staff Association table, 
said the cultural celebration is a 
good way for students and par-
ents to familiarize themselves

StudyFl ................... 
Schools Do Not Reduce 
ChMce of Succi •• 

TOWSO , Md. - In a recent 
report, Princeton University econom-
ics Professor Alan Krueger and his 
research partner Stacy Dale found 
that attending a more selective college 
may not have much to do with post-
graduation success. 

The report is based on a study 
that compared thousands of stu-
dents who attended college in the 
late 1970s. The study, which was 
conducted on an equal number of 
students from selective and not-so-
selective colleges, focused on their 
SAT scores and their salaries in 
1995. 

Students who attended less selec-
tive schools tended to make the same 
amount of money later in life as those 
with similar SAT scores who attended 
more selective schools. 

Accordtng to the report, selective 
schools seem to produce more suc-
cessful graduates because the selec-
tive schools admit more students with 
higher SAT scores. 

According to Krueger and Dale's 
data, students from schools that 
require a higher SAT score for 
admission have a much lower grade 
point average standard . Higher 
grade point averages mean better 
chances of admission to graduate 
programs, which may explain why 
students from lesser-known univer-
sities end up with the same salaries 
as Ivy League graduates. 

The study did, however, reveal a 
correlation between tuition and better 
salaries in the long run. This can be 
attributed to the status of students 
when they apply: Those who have 
enough money and connections to 
afford higher tuition also tend to have 
enough money and connections to 
secure better jobs. It is a matter of 
socio-economics, according to 
Krueger and Dale.

Same Sex Partner Health 
C .. Benefits 

MISSOULA, Mont. - The 
University of Montana Faculty Senate 
endorsed a proposal Thursday that 
seeks to extend health care benefits to 
the same-sex partners of university 
system employees. • 

Outfield Alliance, a coalition of gay 
and bisexual identity groups, 
authored the proposal. Thl! decision 
gives the group added support when 
it appeals to the board of regents to 
overrule an earlier decision made by 
Commissioner of Higher Education 
Dick Crofts. 

The proposal had successfully 
gained the support of the University 
Teachers Union and the Inter-Unit 
Benefits Committee before it was 
halted by Crofts. The commissioner 
opposed the proposal earlier this year 
on the basis that it would have 
"adverse fiscal impact" on the 
statewide university health plan.

Dlylslon of Social Science. 
Recelye. $530,000 Gift 

The DiviSion of Social Sciences received a 
$530,000 gift from Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs to 
support fellowships for graduate students in the 
social sciences. The amount is the largest gift 
UCSD has received in its current campaign to 
raise money for graduate student support. 

Jacobs, who graduated from UCSD in 1979 
with a B.A . in economics, is vice chair of the 
Dean 's Advisory Committee for the social sci-
ences. Until recently he served as senior learn-
ing specialist at Qualcomm. He is now the 
manager of Jacobs Investment Co. Last year, 
he and wife Jerri-Ann donated $3 million to 
establish California's first high-tech charter 
school. l'he innovative "High-Tech High" is 
scheduled to open its doors to 200 ninth and 
10th graders in September in the Loma Portal 
area. 

Graduate fellowships are the diviSion's high-
est fund-raising priority because adequate sup-
port for graduate students enables the universi-
ty to compete with other top research institu-

tions for the best and brightest students. 
RaiSing funds to support graduate students 
became a main goal at UCSD as the university 
became more academically competitive with 
older, wealthier institutions that have greater 
financial resources.

Despite efforts to distinguish itself from corporate bookstores, Groundwork Books negleds customers

Staff Writer 

The Student Center is like a 
universe all its own. It is a bohemi-
an environment, quite separate 
and incomparable to the Price 
Center - hl!b of gossip, activity 
and jamba Juice addicts. When I 
think of the Student Center, I 
think of a place where the liberal-
ism stereotype of college students 
thrives, with groups of 20-some-

thin~s sipping coffee and dis-
cussmg politics or Ayn Rand with 
the son of fervor characteristic of 
the '60s. 

There's the Food Co-op that 
sells what some call "hippie food" 
and those power juice blends with 
more vegetables and fruits than I 
knew existed, and the radio station 
that makes deliberate (and much-
appreciattd) attempts to play 
music to comfon the pop-saturat-
ed soul. 

Amidst this atmosphere of 
tranquility is Groundwork Books. 
It is the counterpart to the univer-
sity bookstore, with overpriced 
sweatshirts and other parapherna-
lia replaced by pro-choice pins 
and gay rights pamphlets. If you 
have ever taken a course in litera-
ture, ph:losophy, communications 
or any other subject outside the 
realm of science, you have most 
likely wandered mto this little 
shop and imagined that it was 
directly imponed from some old, 
romantic, European city. There is 
a sense that freedom of thought is 
not only acceptable, but vinually' 
mandatory upon entrance. 

Vnfonunately, Groundwork is 
a business like any other business 
and its values of democracy and 
liberalism are contradicted by 

business practices that deviate 
from the customer's best interest. 
For instance, Groundwork does 
not take ' credit cards. This has 
been a source of complaints every 
year when a new Groundwork 
customer whips out his or her 
Visa and is told that some other 
means of payment is required -
as if college students have any 
other means of payment. This

about taking back my book. Much 
to my surprise, the book was 
examined as if it were a suspected 
counterfeit $100' bill. 

Then, the unforgivable truth 
revealed itself - apparently, after 
spending a day in the oppressive 
environment of my backpack, the 
book had been damaged beyond 
repair. On the front page, at the

This, however, is not my prima-

I was told that the book could

my bitching and whining about 
the stupidity of such a policy. The 
employee - who shall remain 
nameless because it would obvi-
ously be painful for her to be 
exposed as just another wanna-be

the book to the publisher, who, 
upon seeing the "ravaged" prod-
uct, would demand that 
Groundwork eat the cost. 

After mumbling something 
about the injustice of me having to 
eat the cost instead while I was 
already devouring so many other 
college costs, I said I would have to 
settle for selling the book back to 
them. Oh, wait, Groundwork does 
not do that either! 

With all the class-switching 
and mind-changing that occurs 
within the first few weeks of the 
UCSD quarter, it is ridiculous that 
Groundwork, an institution 
apparently independent of the 
rigidity of the rest of the world, is 
so uptight. The real irony is that 
even the rigidity of the rest of the 
world does not compare to the 
rigidity of Groundwork's policy. 

In all honestly, I have read 
entire books and returned them to 
Barnes & Noble without a prob-
lem. Maybe Groundwork, because 
it does not have the luxury of 
being part of a huge corporation 
that can afford to please cus-
tomers, has to be that strict, but I 
have never encountered such poli-
cies even at independent book-
stores. 

I respect Groundwork for its 
autonomy, but students have to 
know that the price of running a 
quirky little bookstore is high, and 
policies may not reflect the care-
free, hang-loose attitude this store 
projects. So, next time you shop at 
Groundwork, make your selections 
wisely. If you have a book and have 
the stightest inkJing of intent to 
return it, I recommend keeping it 
in an ainight bubble for its safety 
and your financial well-being.

The Supreme Court sided with 
Miranda and his lawyers, setting 
him free, handing down the 
precedent that unless the accused 
is informed of his Fifth 
Amendment rights, any confes-
sion is to be taken as coerced by 
the authorities and is not admissi-
ble in court. 

As Chief Justice Warren wrote 
in his majority opinion, "Prior to 
questioning, the person must be 
warned that he has a right to 
remain silent, that any statement 
he does make may be used against 
him (in a court of law), and that 
he has a right to the presence of 
an attorney: 

Furthermore, the Miranda 
decision established that the 
accused does not have to answer 
any questions unless he wants to 
and if he cannot afford an attor-
ney, he must be provided with 
one. Any decision the Supreme 
Court hands down is law, and is as 
legitimate as any passed by 
Congress and signed by the presi-
dent. 

It may be difficult for some to 
fathom the release of this man 
who was clearly guilty. Howeyer, 
the passing of such a ruling and 
the establishment of these rights 
is integral to Americans' protec-
tion against police abuse. With 
the recent shootings of unarmed 
suspects by ew York City police, 
it would seem like Americans still 
need all the protection we can get.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

A Few Suggestions for the New A.S. Council 
Some of the important issues that will face the newry elected officers off the Associated Students 
By SHANNON CU1U 
Columnist 

Last week I heard a lot of 
promises and plans made by the 
candidates for the various A.S. 
Council positions. However, 
there are quite a few changes that 
I'd like to see made that were not 
mentioned at all. I'd like to take 
this opportunity to make some 
suggestions to the newly elected 
officers. 

1. First and foremost, we have 
the .parking issue. The fastest , 
easiest way to solve the student 
parking crisis is to convert all 
existing "A" and "Reserved" 
spaces into · S" spots. This would 
give students the ability to get to 
class on time, give professors a 
chance to make good on their 
commitmf'nt to really serve stu-
dents and give Chancellor Dynes 
and his buddif's a chance to 

experience the magic of the 
Regents Lot shuttle. It's a win-
win-win situation. 

2. Now that we have a Jamba 
Juice in Price Center, let's go all 
the way with a Starbucks and a 
Fins. Rubio's would work too, but 
Fins is definitely my preferred fish 
taco establishment. 

3. Abolish Daylight Savings 
Time. It's really messing up my 
internal clock. Arizona doesn't 
find it necessary, so why do we? 

4. Add a wing to the Geisel 
Library where I can eat without 
worrying about Mr. Scary Security 
Guy busting me. During finals last 
quarter, I spilled Pepsi all over the 
inside of my backpack while trying 
to smuggle it past library staff. We 
all eat in there anyway; they might 
as well give us a place where the 
books will be safe from our spills. 

S. Allow the student body to 
vote directly on programming. I 
have a really hard time believing 

that a majority of students want-
ed their money spent on Coolio. 

6. Force the bookstore to admit 
that it docs not - nor will it ever 
- save us money, no matter what 
its little charts claim. 

7. Notify the athletic depart-
ment that instead of giving ath-
letes priority ~istration, priority 
registration has Instead been given 
to blond, blue-eyed females 
named Shannon. Calmly explain 
that this shows no bias or 
favoritism; it's just how things 
work. 

8. Make the credit card, varsi-
tybooks.com, bigwords.com peo-

rle on Library Walk go away. No, do not want a free T-shirtl1ol-
Iipoplbouncy ball. 

9. The council should strive to 
develop a productive, working 
relationship with the university 
administration to ensure the ser-
vice of the student body in gener-
al . I hear the new president is 

all·eady working on this ... the rest 
of you should take your cues from 
him. 

10. Finally, and most impor-
tantly, I'd like to remind new A.S. 
Council members that although 
most of the student body doesn't 
ever pay attention to anything the 
council does, I'll be watching. Be 
very afraid. 

So there you have it, guys. 
While I may be totally oblivious to 
the WorkilllP of student govern-
ment, and all of these suggestions 
have been made in total ignorance. 
I trust that you will not take them 
lightly. I have total confidence in 
my opinions and would like to 
assume that everyone fecls the 
same way that I do, about every-
thing. 

Thank you for your time. You 
may now return to ignoring your 
professor.

Silent: 
Pundits point to Miranda 
as being soft on crime 

As Democrats warn, the cir-
cumvention of the Miranda rights 
would re-usher in a time when 
police were able to coerce sus-
pects - by physical intimidation, 
physical force or bargaining for 
lighter sentences - into writing 
confessions. The Miranda rights 
put the words of the Fifth 
Amendment into action, ensuring 
Americans that our rights, even 
when we are accused of a crime, 
are not trampled on. Perhaps 
more selfishly, the Miranda rights 
guarantee that citizens won't be 
punched in the jaw or stomach if 
they won't sign a confession. 

Opponents to the Miranda 
rights claim it ser:ves as a techni-
cality that hinders law enforce-
ment. Bringing politics into the 
mix, Miranda is claimed to sym-
bolize soft-on-crime liberals in 
our government today. 
Conservatives base their efforts to 
roll back the Miranda decision on 
a little-used 1968 law that they 
say pre-empts the Miranda case. 
This law states that a judge is 
given the right to determine if a 
confession given voluntarily is 
admissible or not. 

One has to recognize that the 
Miranda rights assist not only 
suspects, but also police officers 
arresting those suspects. As The 
Wall Street Journal ("Challenge of 
Miranda Law Reignites an Old 
Debate: April 7, 2000) writes, 
"[The Miranda decision I has 
helped make police work more 
professional and has given police 
officers a simple standard to show 
they haven't violated suspects ' 
rights." 

At the same time, Miranda 
rights also help the police by 
showing that, ~caulC the 5~pcc.\ 
was read his or her rights, the offi-
cers followed procedure. This 
makes it difficult to say that police 
violated a suspect's Constitutional 
rights. 

The Miranda rights are not 
merely a convenient method for 
criminals to abstain from confess-
ing their crimes. It is the Fifth 
Amendment fleshed out, working 
to protect all Americans, not just 
criminal suspects, from civil rights 
violations by the police. 

Furthermore, by circumvent-
ing the Miranda rights, only more 
confusion would arise. Steve 
Shafiro, director of the American 
Civi Liberties Union, said that 
reversing the Miranda decision 
would only "embroil the courts 
again in needless and drawn-out 
litigation" over whether confes-
sions are truly voluntary. 

James Madison and his fellow 
Federalists wrote the Bill of Rights 
to cover points not in the 
Constitution: the rights of the 
people of the United States. While 
it gives rights to the people, it also 
defines what the government can-
not do to inhibit these rights. By 
rolling back the Miranda decision, 
one of our most important rights 

. would be inhibited: the right to 
not incriminate ourselves when 
arrested. That simply cannot be 
allowed to happen and hopefully, 
later this month when the U.S. 
Supreme Court reopens the 
stitches of the Miranda case, it will 
not.

Conf •• lon: 
Miranda decision often 
ruins voluntary confessions 
ea..u..., tro. ..... . 
good for the soul, yet a confession 
without a Miranda warning equals 
no case, and society pays the 
price. 

"In some unknown number of 
cases the Cc.!rt's ruling will return 
a killer, a rapist or other criminal to 
the streets and to the environment 
which produced him, to repeat his 
crime whenever it pleases him," 
Justice White said in his dissenting 
opinion in Miranda. 

In a brief filed as a "friend of 
the court: the National District 
Attorneys Association told the 
court, "There can be no debate 
that when a criminal is let free 
because his voluntary confession 
was not preceded by full warn-
ings, the victim is wounded and 
society is harmed ." 

Advocates of "Megan's laws" 
filed a "friend of the court" brief 
detailing the case of a Washington 
state man who was not read his 
rights and escaped conviction in 
the r~pe of a 12-year-old girl, 
although prosecute rs say he 
declared in a confession "that she 
got what she deserved." 

In another case, a Utah man 
admitted to killing his daughter 
after a custody dispute but was set 
free because he was not read his 
Miranda rights before confessing. 

When we enforce the exclu-
sionary rule of Miranda, we are 
catering to the criminals and 
shortchangin$ the victims. The 
scales of lady Justice tip in favor of 
the criminal while the victims are 
left without justice, and many-
times, without their lives. 

As much as the supporters of 
the Miranda decision claim that a 
warning is a Constitutional right 
guaranteed by the Fifth 
Amendment, the facts prove oth-
erwise. 

According to Justice Harlan's 
dissenting opinion in the case, 
Miranda is a "poor constitutional 
law." 

Justice White also dissented by 
saying, "The. proposition that the 
privilege against self-incrimina-
tion forbids in-custody interroga-
tion without warnings specified in 
the majority opinion and without 
clear waiver of counsel hIS no sig-
nificant support in the history of 
the privilege or in the language of 
the Fifth Amendment: 

History has proven Justice 
White correct: The Miranda ruling 
goes far beyond the boundaries 
and constraints of the Fifth 
Amendment. 

By excluding voluntary confes-
sions, Miranda overstates the Fifth 
Amendment privilege and sacri-
fices society's interest in uncover-
ing evidence of crime and punish-
ing those who violate its laws. 

When the Supreme Court first 
applied the Fifth Amendment to 
federal custodial interrogation in 
1897, it relied on a voluntary test 
with no special warnings or other 
procedures. Until Miranda, all 
state and federal confessions were 
analyzed under the same principle 
of volunteering. Now, under 
Miranda, all confessions, even vol-
untarily given ones, can be 
thrown out if the warning is not 
read. • 

The Supreme Court must 
overturn the Miranda ruling so 
that the scales of justice are once 
again balanced; so that the pro-
tection of victims' rights super-
sedes the protection of confessed 
criminals.

hanged in effigy. 

The 68-year-old legislator is 
fine-tuning a plan that could give 
wavering House Democrats the 
pol itical cover they want to vote yes 
on a the biggest trade deal in recent 
years, an accord with China. If 
Levin succeeds, Congress will help 

hand Beijing a diplomatic coup 
while opening new markets for 
American goods, but will still keep 
leverage over China's behavior on 
human rights, religious tolerance 
and the environment. 

"Members are searching for a 
way to both keep the heat on China 
and get the benefits of what we 
negotiated," Levin said in his 
Capitol Hill office. "We have to 
strive to combine active engagement 
with constructive confrontation.· 

For 20 years Congress has gone 
through the motions of an annual 
debate and vote to grant China the 
same trading privileges that 
Washington gives almost every 
other country. 

Congress has never refused to 
provide this plum. 

China is now on the verge of 
joining the World Trade 
Organization, and as r.an of a deal 
negotiated last fal, President 
Clinton promised to try to lift the 
annual review and grant Beijing 
permanent trading status. 

The House will vote just before 
Memorial Day, but the outcome is 
too close to call . The fate of the 
agreement rests with about two 
dozen uncommitted Democrats. 
Passage in the pro-business 
Senate is considered certain. 

Enter Levin, a senior member 
of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, who is one of the 
fence-sitters and has long wrestled 
with trade issues. Levin came away 
from a 10-day trip to China in 
January convinced that this trade 

agreement . would influence the 
future of U.S.-China relations for 
years to come. 

Levin has drawn up a plan to 
monitor China once it joins the 
wro, and to react swiftly to any 
violations. The proposal sets up a 
congressional-executive branch 
commission to monitor China's 
behavior on human rights and 
trade - the biggest concern of 
opponents to giving up the yearly 
review - and arm It with a quiver 
of rewards and penalties. 

The plan would also write into 
law promises China made to the 
United States to avoid surges of 
Chinese exports into the American 
market.

messages. 

LO DON - In a determined 
move to free himself from growing 
internal opposition to the 

orthern Ireland peace agree-
ment, David Trimble, Ulster'S 
most prominent Protestant politi-
cian, said Sunday that he would 
rid his party governing council of 
members of the traditionally mili-
tant Orange Order. 

The 80,OOO-strong fraternity. 
whose parades of marchers in 
bowler hats and orange sashes 
hdve convulsed onhern Ireland 
in recent summers, opposes the 
peace agreement, which seeks to 
establish a Ca tholic-Protestant 
power-sharing government in the 
con flicted British province. The 
Orange Order also has backed 
recent attempts to overthrow 
Trimble's moderate leadership of 

the Ulster Unionist Party. 
Control of the council by 

Trimble, 55, was threatened last 
m nth in a vote that showed sur-
prising support for his challenger, 
the Rev. Martin Smyth, a 68-year-
old former Worshipful Grand 
Master of the order. Of the 348 
ballots cast against Trimble - 43 
percent of those voting - 120 
came from the Oran~e Order, 
whose block membership he now 
plans to eliminate. 

The change is to be taken up 
by the party's rules committee in 
June before the kickoff of the 
annual "marching season" and will 
most likely ucceed since Trimble 
needs only a majority to put it 
through. The July parades com-
memorate the victory of the

The announcement Sunday, 
made in an interview with The

significant forward motion in 
stalemated talks since the eight-
week-old home rule administra-
tion was suspended on Feb. 11 .

British and Irish governments and

Ulster Unionists and their 
Catholic rivals, Sinn Fein, the 
political ally of the Irish

action to forestall a situation in 
which Trimble would be pressured 
into resigning his leadership of the 
Ulster Unionists. The British 
believe that Trimble is essential to 
any overall settlement and that any 
successor to him would come 
from the rcjectionist ranks of the 
party - those opp sed to the 
peace accord, which passed its 
second anniversary April 9. 

There appeared to be modest 
progress on a range of issues con-
fronting the fund, some of which are 
high on the agenda of outside critics. 
The finance ministers asked the 
fund's managers to coniinue a 
review of thCIT lending programs 
with an eye to eliminating some. The 
fund was also told to review whether 
to use variable pricing on some loan 
programs so as to discourage repeat-
ed, long-term borrowing.

Family Takes Stand Against Drug Testing 
LOCKNEY, Texas - For three 

years, people in this tiny ~rming 
town fretted that stopping the local 
drug problem was like trying to 
lasso the winds that blow day and 
night off the flat Texas plains. 
Teachers complained of students 
getting stoned at lunch. Parents 
worried that their children were get-
ting high without their knowing it. 

Eventually, after an emotional 
public meeting and demands that 
something be done, the school 
board here enacted what is ccn-
sidered to be the toughest school 
drug testing policy in the nation . 

. It requires that all junior and 
senior high school students take a 
mandatory drug test. There is no 
choice; refusal by a parent or stu-
dent draws the same punishment 
as failure to pass the test, an in-
school suspension for first 
offenders. 

ow, as many other school dis-
tricts across the country institute 
drug tests, Lockney, with only 
2,200 residents, has become an 
unlikely constitutional battle-
ground. A parent, aided by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, 
filed a lawsuit in March asserting 
that the policY violated his and his 
son's Fourth Amendment rights 
against unreasonable searches. 

Arguments in the case could be 
heard as soon as this summer by a 
federal judge. 

"They cannot tell me how I'm 
supposed to believe," said the par-
ent, Larry Tannahill, 35, whose 12-
year-old son, Brady, attends the 
junior high. "I believe in the 
Constitution, and because I believe 
in our Constitution and our rights, 
you're going to punish my son? I 
don't think so." 

Since 1995, when the U.S. 

Supreme Court opened the door to 
drug testing in schools by permit-
ting the testing of athletes, the 
unanswered question has been 
where would schools, and ulti-
mately the coun, draw the line. 
Until now, school districts had 
been tentative in pushing the 
boundaries, particularly because 
legal challenges to wider testing are 
pending in Oklahoma, New Jersey 
and other states. But Lockney's 
policy of testing every student has 
shattered any boundaries. 

"If the policy has no teeth, 
there's no use having it," said 
Donald G. Henslee, the lawyer rep-
resenting the Lockney 
Independent School District. 
Henslee said that at least a dozen 
other Texas districts had inquired 
about instituting a similar policy.

"I chose the Independent slate 
because it is the greatest assembly 
of candidates ever put together," he 
said. "Every single member is the 
most qualified to do their position, 
and therefore I consider it an 
honor to run with such a group." 

A.S.· Vice President Internal-
elect Jeff Dodge said he agrees with 
such sentiments and said that the 
experience of this slate's members 
will lead the new council to suc-
cess. 

"I really felt that bringing 
together such an experienced 
group of people to run in the A.S. 
elections would provide students 
one year off from the prominent 
divisiveness the campus usually 
(has)," he said. "I just hope that 
students recognize all our efforts as 
genuine and solely for the students 
ofUCSD." 

Dodge said he recognizes that 
the support of his slate helped in 
his campaign, but added that other, 
more important factors were keys 

to victory as well. 
"If you [are) yourself, stand up 

for what you believe in and fight for 
all those who will fight for you, 
you'll succeed," he said. "Making 
empty promises to win the A.S. 
election is a waste of my time as 
well as the students. I represented 
myself and no one else. • 

Dodge said he feels that going 
through the campaign process 
taught him valuable tools for the 
years to come. 

"Campaigning and the entire 
election process really put me 
through a lot of stress," he said. 
"I'm definitely glad I went through 
it though, because I think it really 
forces potential A.S. executives to 
orient and center themselves 
around the things that are impor-
tant to students here at UCSD." 

Although he won't take office 
- until fifth week spring quaner, 

Dodge already began working on 
his responsibilities, organizing a 
seminar to encourage incoming 
freshmen to run for A.S. positions.

university is in for a revolutionary

Because of the low voter turnout, 
a fee referendum that would have 
raised student fees by 75 cents per 
student per quarter failed. While it 
received the support of a majority of 
the voters, a 25 percen t voter 
turnout was needed for the measure 
to pass. The fee increase would have 
funded the United States Student

An !n-depth 
rundown of 
everything a 

student should 
know before 
applying to 

medical school, 
including helpful 

hints that will 
keep students 
from flatlining 

on their 
application 

etting into medical 
school is a long and 
complicated process 
which concerns a large 
proportion of UCSO 
students. It is not only 
stressful but extremely 
competitive. Despite 

being such a harrowing experience, get-
ting into medical school is quite possi-
ble for UCSD students. A greater 
understanding of the process can shed 
light on the optimal route for anyone on 
the path toward medical school. 
.......... . 

According to Thomas Bond, Revelle 
college provost, approximately 50 per-
cent of UCSD students who apFlied 
were admitted into medical schoo last 
year. UCSD's strong science focu.s and 
reputation resulted in success for stu-
dents applying to medical school. 

"UCSD and Berkeley are tied for 
first in percentage of students who get 
in, and UCLA is not far behind; Bond 
~d. He added that the average grade 
point average for UCSD applicants to 
medical school for fall of 1999 was 3.61 , 
with an average Medical College 
Admissions Test score of 30. 

"You need to be in the top 25 per-
cent of grade point averages and MCAT 
[scores) in order to get into medical 
school: Bond said. Last year, 29 of the 
120 freshmen enrolled at the UCSO 
School of Medicine had graduated from 
UCSD.

year of organic chemistry with lab, one 
year of biology with lab, one year of 
physics with lab, one year of English 
and one year of calculus or other 
advanced math . 

[n addition, many schools require a 
certain number of nonscience classes. 
Since these courses vary from school to 
school, one should consult the require-
ments of cach particular medical school 
to find out specifics. 

"Some schools weigh the science 
grade point average more, but other 
schools weigh [science and non science) 
equally; Bond said. "There are 120 
medical schools, and they all do things 
differently: 

Occasionally, high school AP units 
will fulfill undergraduate requirements, 
but medical schools like to see students 
pursue even the science classes they 
have been excused from. 

For instance, if a student fulfilled 
Chemistry 6A with AP credits, some 
schools such as UCLA will expect the 
student to take another upper-divrsion 
chemistry class. 
CIa.Dlh ........ 

According to the Medical School 
Admissions Board, students do not 
need to be science majors to get in to 
medical school. In fact, the Board said 
that history majors have some of the 
highest percentages of acceptance to 
medical colleges, and biology majors 
some of the lowest. However, the Board 
does not recommend that students 
switch to a histoty major in order to get 
in. Instead, students are encouraged to 
find a major that interests them, and do 
well in it. All that medical schools really 
care about is how much a student has 
learned in school, and grades are reflec-
tive of this. 

MYour major should be something 
you really love; Bond said . "[fthat hap-
pens to be history, you will still have to 
take chemistry, calculus, physics, organ-
ic chemistry, but you can still be any 

major.~ He also said that double majors 
and minors will not increase a student's 
probability of getting into medical 
school. 
..... PoIIItA ..... 

Indeed, the greatest determining fac-
tor of whether one will get into medical 
school is grade point average. Note, 
however, that there are two grade point 
averages that medical schools take into 
consideration: science and non science. 
Medical schools usually weigh the sci-

FEATURES 11 

ence grade point averages more heavily. 
Students who currently have 4.0 

grade point averages "Should try to 
maintain it. Students with imperfect 
grade point averages should not be dis-
couraged, however. The Medical School 
Admissions Board points out that 
"there's not always a clear grade break 
determining who will and who won't be 
accepted: 

There are always students with per-
fect grade point averages who don't get 
into the medical schools of their choice. 
According to the weekly bulletin put 
out by Kaplan, www.kaplan.com. 
"because your grade point average is 
subject to such variability and interpre-
tation, your performance on the MCAT 
is becoming increasingly important: 
MeAT 

The MCAT is the second determin-
ing factor for whether a student will get 
into medical school. A student's MCAT 
score will be more important than the 
grade point average for some schools, 
but in others the grade point average is 
weighed more heavily. Again, the stan-
dards vary for different schools. The 
MCAT is normally taken spring of a 
student's junior year. 

. The MCAT has four sections: a 
physical sciences section that consists 
of physics and introductory inorganic 
chemistry questions, a biological sci-
ences section that consists of biology 
and organic chemistry questions, a 
reading comprehension section that 
consists of reading passages and ques-
tions, and a writing sample section that 
consists of twO essay questions. The 
first three sections are graded on a scale 
of 1 to 15 and the last section is graded 
with letters 0, P, Q, R, Sand T. The first 
three scores are usually added to 
together to give a maximum score of 45. 

"Preparing for the MCAT requires a 
lot of diligence - and diligence is what 
the MCAT measures; states the 
Medical School Admissions Board. 
"Getting high scores is really a function 
of how badly you want to get in, and if'! 
our opinion, how badly you want to get 
in is the most important information an 
admissions committee can have about 
your potential success." 

The earlier a student starts preparing 
for the MCAT, the better their results 
will be. When studying for the MCAT, it 
is a good idea to buy test preparation

The Editor's Soapbox 
One students solo travels through Europe prove to be a life-changing experience that she wont soon forget 
Iy UNDIAY . WOIIIIO 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Studying abroad was all the rage 
my junior year, and most of my 
friends were leaving to go to Spain, 
Hungary or Honduras - but not 
me. I had planned to study a year in 
India, then decided on a semester in 
London, but got too caught up in 
school assignments and studies to 
worry about organizing a quarter 
abroad and applying for additional 
scholarships and financial aid. I was 
a little bit too lazy to get all my 
papers in on time. As a result, I was 
left to endure another normal year at 
our wonderful American institution, 
UCSD. 

One night I was at a friend's din-
ner party drinking beer and eating 
cheese dip, when I started a conver-
sation with a girl who had just come 
back from traveling in Europe for 
three months alone - no itinerary, 
no friends, no official organization. I 
was quite amazed because the idea 
of traveling alone anywhere had 
never really crossed my mind, much 
less on another continent. 

I decided that night that traveling 
alone through Europe was exactly 
what I was going to do. 

First of all, Europe is not too 
much of a culture shock. Sure. there 
are different driving laws and a 
younger drinking age. and Eastern 
Europe has quite a different political 
and social history altogether. But for 
the most part, the transition is eased 
by the numerous similarities and the 

fact that English is taught to most 
Europeans in grade school. This is 
not to discredit the rich and diverse 
cultural history that the distinct 
European countries enjoy, because 
the differences are many. It's just 
that these differences do not hinder 
traveling, they enhance it. 

Also, to take into account, there 
is the danger of traveling alone, 
especially for a female. 

The girl who I met at the party 
told me that she hadn't run into any 
trouble throughout the len2th of her 
trip and reminded me that European 
cities have a lower crime rate than 
American cities. Growing up in Los 
Angeles. living through riots, shoot-
ings and the occasional high school 
bomb threat, I personally wasn't 
daunted at all. I saw it as a challenge 
and, quite frankly, something I could 
be proud to say I had done as a 
woman. 1hlveling alone through 
different countries offered me a 
chance to overcome the fear of being 
alone for the rest of my life. 

Another great benefit to traveling 
alone was the lack of preparation it 
required. I didn't have to fill out any 
paperwork except to apply for a 
passport and didn't have to coordi-
nate with anyone else or any organi-
zation as to where to go. My direc-
tion would be decided only by my 
whim. 

I also had more control over pric-
ing and was able to budget as low as 
possible - traveling with a three-
month Eurail pass and staying in 
hostels. Lonely Planet'S guide to 

No itinerary, no friends, 
no official organization. I 
was quite amazed because 
the idea of traveling alone 
anywhere had never real-
ry crossed my mind, much 
less on another continent. 
I decided that night that 
traveling alone through 
Europe was exactry what 
1 was going to do. 
Europe was my main help as far as 
finding lodging, cheap food and 
entertainment in each city. 

Aside from personal safety and 
traveling practicality, I was a little 
worried about becomin~ dreadfully 
lonely. Going city to cty, town to 
town with no one to share it with did 
not sound like a welcoming idea. I 

very much enjoy spending time with 
myself - but all day, every day? 

Once again my dinner party 
friend expelled my fears and told me 
that she wasn't alone as much as she 
would have liked. 

At each hostel, she met many 
people who explored the town with 
her; sometimes they even traveled to 
the next destination with her. She 
said everyone exchanged e-mail 
addresses and kept in touch, like a 
roving band of Internet gypsies. 

"I'll meet you in Amsterdam on 
the 4th - ( hooked up a place we 
can stay." 

It sounded like a dream. 
So finally the summer before 

my senior year, all doubts and 
reservations aside, I did what I 
needed to do. 

First, I went to UCSD and told 
them I needed a leave of absence for 
fall quarter. Then I called Airhitch, a 
company that provides cheap airfare 
by finding extra seats on existing 
flights, and bought a ticket The 
interesting thing about Airhitch, is 
that you don't find out in which air-
port you're landing until a few days 
before you fiy, depending on what is 
available. 

Then, I borrowed a friend's back-
pack, outfitted myself with the mini-
mal amount of necessities to travel 
for three months and waited. 

On Sept. t t, I called up Airhitch 
and found out that there was a flight 
with extra seats leaving for 
Amsterdam the next day. I packed 
up all my stuff, called all of my

friends to say good-bye and drove 
with my parents down to Los 
Angeles International Airport the 
next day. 

I was scared to death to get on 
that plane. and all of my grand plans 
for my exploration of Europe fled 
my mind. What the hell was I doing? 
The flight began boarding and my 
parents weren't allowed to follow me 
to the gate. I said good-bye and went 
to my plane. 

Over the next three months I 
ended up going to Amsterdam, 
Harlem, Munich, Prague, Krakow, 
Vien/J3, Budapest, Milan, Lecco, 
Venice, Naples, ' Sicily, Padua, 
Florence, the Italian Alps. Paris, 
Bordeaux, Bilbao, Madrid, Seville. 
Barcelona, Nice and Lausanne. 

There were times when I was 
horribly lonely, and I spent full days 
in Internet cafes complaining to my 
friends. However, there were many 
more times when I met amazing 
people who traveled with me. 
opened their homes to me, talked 
with me and took me to the great 
places. Many of these experiences I 
would not have had, had I studied 
abroad or even traveled with a 
friend. 

By the time I left Europe I was 
more than ready to come home and 
see my friends and family. It is hard 
living out of a backpack and con-
stantly moving about. It is not easy 
entering each new city and culture 
alone either, but it was exactly that 
challenge which made my trip 
unforgettable and life-changing.

UCSD Food Gets World-Class Help 
A select group ojUCSD cooks recently had the opportunity to learn .new culinary skills from top chefs 
.,AUXLD 
StBff Writer 

All too often, the food here at 
UCSD is grossly under-appreciated. 
Many students fail to realize that 
there are real, living, breathing cooks 
behind the scenes preparing their 
food daily. Recently, a select number 
of these UCSD cooks had the 
opponunity to learn new culinary 
skills from a world-class chef 
through a workshop known as the 
Culinary Enhancement Workshop. 

Sponsored by The National 
Association of Colleges and 
Universities Food Services, the 
annual event took place during 
spring break at UCSD's Sierra 
Summit from March 28 to 31. 

The purpose of the workshop 
was to enhance the skills and tech-
niques of the food service industry. 
In particular, the program was aimed 
at beginning cooks, providing them 
with an overview of the many culi-
nary flavors that exist around the 
world 

The workshop began on Thesday 
evening with a reception at the 
Radisson rnn welcoming the partici-
pants. Each day was broken down 
into three segments. 

The first segment included an 
hour of class time where cooks were 
introduced to various cuisines, 
including their history. background 
and characteristics. In addition, dif-
ferent techniques were taught 0(1 
how to best utilize different herbs 
and spices. 

The second segment featured 
Lars Kronmark, chef instructor at 
the Culinary Institute of America in 
the Napa Valley. Cooks were able to 

observe a demonstration by the 
renowned chef on how to properly 
prepare different foods. The final 
segment had each cook prepare a 
specific menu. Afterward, the pre-
pared food was critiqued and eaten. 

Margaret Nagase, human 
resources manager at UCSD, point-
ed out the significance of the last 
segment. 

The purpose of the work-
shop was to enhance the 
skills and techniques of 
the food service industry. 
In particular, the program 
was aimed at beginning 
cooks by providing them 
an overview of the many 
culinary flavors that exist 
around the world. 

"It was the most imponant part 
of the class because it showcased all 
of the recipes." she said. "For me, it 
was the greatest educational pan of 
the workshop, because of the feed-
back that was given back to the 
cooks." 

Every day of the workshop had a 
theme. The first day included an 
overview of the entire workshop, 
titled "Kitchen Productivity 
Workstation Organization; which 
included demonstrations on tech-
niques ranging from knife use to 
chicken de-boning. 

"Asian Aavors" was the theme 
for the second day. As Nagase point-

ed out, the day was unique in that 
the focus was not on the usual 
japanese and Chinese cuisine. There 
was an emphasis on many different 
types of cuisine, including 
Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and 
Indian foods. 

For many, including Nagase, this 
was the best pan of the workshop. 

"Here at Canyon VISta, there's an 
Asian [food) section. It was refresh-
ing to learn so much more about the 
different spices and spice rubs that 
make up the cuisine: 

After the final critiques, the team 
of cooks made a spontaneous nip to 
the Asian food megastore, Ranch 99, 
For many, including Kronmark, it 
was their first experience shopping 
from such a large store that features 
primarily Asian food. 

"It was really a wonderful expe-
rience," Nagase said. "You have to 
picture the situation - all the 
cooks and Lars still in their chef 
uniforms, walking down the aisles 
pointing out all the different items. 
What made it so special was the 
fact that he was so impressed with 
the store. I felt proud that we could 
impress such a world-class chef 
with the resources available here in 
San Diego." 

The third day featured a healthy 
mix of vegetarian and 
Mediterranean cuisine titled "Food 
Trends, Healthy Cooking Practices, 
Italian/Mediterranean Flavors, 
Marinades, Spices, Rubs and 
Pasta." 

The final day allowed each cook 
to stretch their abilities in making 
their own unique barbecue sauces. 
Titled "Contemporary Sauces, 
Salsas and Bases: the foulth day 

focused on the techniques of 
grilling, boiling and barbecuing. 

"The event was excellent; 
Lardizabal said. "I believe every 
cook should go through this pro-
gram because of its high quality. 
For many of these cooks, it was a 
once-in-a-lifetime experience: 

Brian Klippel, dining services 
director at UCSD, added to this 
sentiment, acknowledging the 

. wonderful performance of chef 
Kronmark, in panicular. 

"It wasn't just that he was a real-

NichcUs Rln:o/Gua-diMI 

Iy great chef, technically. He was 
also a fabulous instructor with the 
ability to push [the cooks) to new 
limits. He was a good mix of ~ood 
instructor and good motivauon; 
Klippel said. 

Panicipants in the workshop 
included other cooks from the 
West and Midwest. A total of 18 
cooks were selected by their 
respective college or university 
administrations. Out of the 18 
cooks selected, three were from 
UCSD.

Arlee (March 21-April19) 
You're lucky through the mid-

dle of the week, so don't procrasti-
nate. Take care of a personal matter 
with a partner or attorney on 
Monday and Tuesday. Pay a big bill 
on Tuesday or Wednesday but save 
enough to buy food. Definitely go 
someplace fun this weekend, 
preferably with an older person you 
respect and admire. 

,_,.. (April 20-May 20) 
Take care of old business 

Monday and Tuesday and clean up 
everything you possibly can. 
Around Wednesday the sun will 
come into your sign, and you and a 
partner can accomplish a lot - if 
you can keep from squabbling over 
petty jealousiti. Friday and 
Saturday should be good for shop-
ping, especially if you want to buy 
expensive items that have to last a 
long time. Hang out with relatives 
on Sunday. 

...... (May 21-June 21) 
Friends need your support on 

Monday and Tuesday. Help them 
figure out what to do next. Get 
practical Wednesday and Thursday 
and get as much work done 3.S pos-
sible. By Friday you'll lose interest 
in being serious, and you'll only 
want to play. This condition lasts 
through most of Saturday. It may 
be Sunday before you can be trust-
ed to make wise financial decisions 
again, so take care! 

c.c.r (June 22-July 22) 
You could get slightly frazzled 

on Monday and Tuesday. You 
should calm down on Wednesday, 
and Thursday looks good for 
romance. You may be in the mood 
to work on Friday and Saturday, so 
set it up. On Sunday let your part-
ner make all major decisions and 
do the driving, too. You should 
just lean back and enjoy the 
scenery. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
You may be in a good mood the 

first part of this week. Getting 
studying done will be hard - but 
worthwhile. You could have some 
good opportunities during the next 
few weeks, starting about 
Wednesday. The harder you work, 
the luckier you'll get. Schedule 
romantic and sports activities for 
Friday and Saturday and do house-
hold projects on Sunday. 
Vlrp (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 

By now your money matters 
should be pretty well figured out. 
Wrap up any loose ends so you 
can take a vacation after 
Wednesday. Travel conditions get 
much better then. Do planning 
and elTands on Thursday. Tidy up 
your place on Friday and Saturday 
so you can have company over on 
Sunday. 

UIInI (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
If you have partnerships or legal 

matters that need attention, do 
them Monday and Tuesday. Don't 
wait any longer. Figure out your 
budget on Wednesday and 
Thursday and put as much as you 
possibly can into savings. This is 
important! Cram the most interest-
ing activities you can think of into 
Friday- and Saturday but keep 

Monday, April 17, 2000 

Sunday quiet. You'll want to catch 
up on your beauty rest then. 

IcorpIo (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Monday and Tuesday could be 

slightly stressful. Check as many 
items as you can off your list so 
you'll be free to do other things. 
After about Wednesday you 'll 
become more interested in part-
nerships. Any you make during 
the next few weeks will last, so 
think about your options careful-
ly. Wednesday and Thursday will 
be good for serious discussions. 
You could discover a real treasure 
on Friday or Saturday, so dig for 
one. Sunday's best for catching up 
on family gossip and doing 
errands. 

1ICIttM- (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Monday and Tuesday should be 

lots of fun . Be careful, though, 
because reality may rear its ugly 
head around Wednesday. You 'll 
have lots of work, through the end 
of the month, so be prepared. 
Finish old business on Wednesday 
and Thursday. Keep a notebook 
around on Friday and Saturday; 
you'll come up with brilliant ideas 
then. Buy yourself a practical, spe-
cial treat on Sunday. 

C.,rIconI (Dec . 22-Jan. 19) 
Your home and family are 

important to you on Monday and 
Tuesday, so you can entertain 
around Wednesday. You'll want to 
have loved ones around for the 
next four weeks, at least. Fall in love 
on ~ednesday and Thursday. On 
Friday and Saturday work needs to 
be done, so scurry around and do 
it. Have people over again on 
Sunday. 

..... (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 
Study on Monday and Tuesday, 

as quickly as you can. So many 
interesting things going on, so little 
timel You may decide to fIX a few 
things around the house during 
the next few weeks. Make a big 
decision or two on Wednesday and 
Thursday. These will stick, so be 
careful. Get together with friends 
on Friday and Saturday. Go 
through your notes on Sunday and 
do whatever you've forgotten that's 
due tomorrow! 

...... (Feb. 19-March 20) 
You have probably thought a lot 

about money for the past few 
weeks. Put as much as you can into 
savings on Monday and Tuesday. 
Your focus will shift to education 
for the next few weeks. You'll 
absorb new material well over the 
next few weeks. Tackle the most 
difficult subjects you can think of, 
especially Wednesday and 
Thursday. Learn from your elders 
on Friday and Saturday and goof 
off with friends on Sunday. 

.........,. 'IIIIa w..k 
April 17: A partner is handy to 

have, especially this year. Besides 
companionship, the two of you 
could strike it rich! 

April 18: Save up your pennies, 
and you may be able to take anoth-
er honeymoon. Get your partner to 
save up, too, and it's a sure thing. 

April 19: Finish old business 
this year. Your past experience will 
lead you to a more secure future. 

April 20: Ask for what you want 
this year, and you're liable to get it. 
Work through a partner, and your 
odds go up even more. 

April 21 : You could stash away 
quite a lot this year, and if you do, 
you could accrue great wealth . 
Why not? Couldn't happen to a 
nicer person. 

April 22: You're lucky this year, 
especially if you play by the rules. 
You would be wise to stick to a 
budget, too. 

April 23: The only risk that will 
payoff for you this year is a highly 
calculated dne. You'll probably hear 
about it from a close friend , in pri-
vate.

Admission: 
Haw involved shouJd you 
be in activities? 

tion. Kaplan recommends that stu-
dents not wOrty too much about 
!hat which can't be improved and 
Instead work on improving science 
SCores. 

Students who feel that their 
score isn't adequate after taking the 
MCAT the first time shouldn't 
wOrty. This eight-hour examina-
tion can be taken up to three times. 
Before taking the test the second 
lime, students should find out 
which section they did most poorly 
on the first time and prepare for 
that subject more heavily than the 
others. 

In order to take the test a fourth 
ti~e .a student must provide a 
rejection letter from a medical 
school to show that they are still 
trying to get into a school. This is 
not advisable by the Kaplan bul-
letin. It reads, "Think twice before 
doing this, however - taking the 
!est that often. might put your abil-
Ity to do medical school work into 
question: 
1xtr8cwrIc. .. ActIvItI_ 

According to Bond, simply hav-
ing a high grade point average and 
a good- MCAT score will not get 

you into the top medical schools. 
"[AI good MCAT [score) and 

grade point average are essential, 
but they are not enough to get into 
medical school. You need to be 
involved and you need to be a peo-
ple person. You can say you're a 
people person but you need to 
have demonstrated it: 

Involvement in extracurricular 
activities is important to include in 
an application because it reflects 
things about a student that numer-
ical scores can never show. Do not, 
however, allow an excessive num-
ber of extracunicular activities to 
take time away from studying. 
Recommended activities include 
research, community service or

3000 miles isn't 
too far to travel 
to secure 
your future. 
There's a small school in Philadelphia with a national reputation for developing 
leaders in the health professions. It's Thomas Jefferson University's College of Health 
Professions. Located in the center of one of the nation's premier healthcare cities, 
Jefferson teaches students to become thinkers, innovators and leaders in the fields 
of nursing, diagnostic imaging, phvsical or occupational therapy and lab sciences. 
They do that through a dynamic curriculum combined with real-world clinical 
practice opportunities. You'll graduate with a bachelor's or ma tee's degree and be 
among the most sought after professionals in your field. Last year, 93% of our 
graduates had jobs soon after graduation. If you have a passion for helping people 
and realize that a short trip east is a small price to pay for a lifetime of success, then 
you owe it to yourselfto look to Jefferson. 
A higher form of higher education.

22 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian ~onda~April 17.2000 

Tennis Falls to Point Loma Nazarene Champs: Tritons take NCAA's 
with two solid victories Injuries and suspensions likely were the difference between victory and defeat in last Friday's match 
CGIdIMed".. ..... 24 
answer for Hite or Chen on 
offense. The Tritons jumped 
out to a 14-9 lead and looked 
to be cruising to another game 
victory before NYU fought 
back. The Violets won the next 
three points and had many 
opportunities to get within 
one, but they could never take 
advantage of those opportuni-
ties. Tht: Tritons closed out the 
game at 15-12 and were within 
one game o( victory. 

.yIllLLBU ..... 
Sports Editor 

With its biggest match of the 
season on the horizon and its best 
player out with a stress fracture, the 
men's tennis team faced Point 
Lorna Nazarene University on 
Friday afternoon. The Tritons' 
neighbors to the south looked vul-
nerable at times, but UCSD didn't 
have enough and eventually fell to 
Point Lorna 2-5. 

In doubles the Tritons had their 
share of problems but still could 
have won the point. At No. 1 dou-
bles, Dan Albrecht and Mike Rosett 
were down two breaks at 3-6 and 
looked to be out of the match .. With 
some intense returning, Albrecht 
and Rosen got both of the breaks 
back and drew even at 6-6. After 
that, Point Lorna turned it up a 
notch and won the next two games 
to take the proset 8-6. 

"We basically gave it away after 
getting back to 6-6: Head Coach 
Eric Steidlmayer said. "I think if we

Tritons go 1-1 during last 
weekend's competitions

lead but failed to capitalize as they 
could not convert their ejection 
advantages on six of their seven 
attempts. The two UCSD tallies 
were had by Samara Silverman and 
Emma Kudritzki. The Tritons, who 
fell to 12-12 on the season were 
eager to put this game behind them 
and were highly anticipating 
Saturday'S matchup against Loyola 

would have won that set we would 
have had a good chance to win the 
match." 

At No.2 doubles Joe Diehl and 
Sean Nagle got down early and 
never did get the break back. Later 
in the match they lost another 
break and went on to lose the 
match 8-4. 

The highlight of doubles play 
for the Tritons was the play of Ari 
Frankel and Cedric Mazzara. The 
duo was put together because of 
Michael Meyer's injury and Corey 
Moderhak's suspension. They 
played well and came out on top by 
a score of 8-5. 

By winning two of the three 
doubles prosets, Point Loma 
secured the doubles point. 

In singles, the Tritons had their 
troubles at the top. UCSD lost at the 
top four singles spots. something 
that may well have been different, 
had it had its ideal lineup intact. 

"For the most part we played 
fairly well: Steidlmayer said. "The 
main thing that hun us was having 

Maramount. 
Maybe they were sore from the 

prior afternoon's showdown, but 
when the whistle blew on 
Saturday the Tritons looked fee-
ble. falling to a 5-3 deficit after the 
first quarter. Coach Larry Sanders 
obviously gave his squad a firm 
talking-to during the interim, as 
the game was all Tritons from the 
second quarter on . They had 
three second-quarter goals to the 
Lion's one, which knotted the 
game 6-6 at the half. 

The second half opened with a 
third-quarter Triton goal scoring 
lull. which allowed the Lions to 

guys out. Even though we were 
missing some guys we still had a 
chance to win." 

At No. 1 singles, Dan Albrecht 
had his hands full against Rodrigo 
Suarez from Point Lorna Nazarene. 
Being an NAIA school, Point Lorna 
is allowed a few scholarships and 
Suarez is one of their scholarship 
players. He rolled over Albrecht 6-
0, 6-0 and left little doubt that be 
would have given any potential 
Triton No. 1 fits. 

Mike Rosett had little more luck 
at No. 2 singles. Rosett fought 
hard, as he always does, but he did-
n't have enough to be competitive 
with his opponent and fell 2-6, 3-6. 

At No. 3 singles, Sean 
Higginbotham had similar troubles 
and fell 2-6, 2-6 to his opponent. 

The closest match of the day 
was at No.4 singles and featured 
Ryan Thompson from UCSD. 
Thompson was on early and took 
the first set 6-2 .·The second set was 
lost just as fast as the first was won 
as Thompson fell 2-6 to send the 

creep back into the lead, at 7-6. The 
Tritons came out with all cylinders 

. firing, however. in the decisive 
fourth quarter, caging five huge 
goals to clinch the victory. 

The Triton's Dana Tucker came 
up strong in the effort, leading the 
team with three goals: Erin Welsh, 
Silverman and Kudritzki all scored 
twice while Alice Huszcz and 
Jennifer Sheveland chipped in sin-
gle goals for the victors. Goalie 
Maryam Hadiashar also con-
tributed, knocking down three 
saves in the cage. 

The 14th-ranked Loyola Mara-
mount Lions' record fell to 11 -9 

match to a third set. Through 10 
games the final set was tied at five. 
1bompson then lost his serve and 
his opponent went on to win 7-5 to 
take the match in three sets. 

The bottom two singles spots 
belonged to UCSD. At No. 5 sin-
gles, Sean Nagle played a strong 
match and prevailed 6-4, 6-4. An 
Franket provided his usual flair as 
he easily won the first set 6-1 
before losing the second set 5-7. In 
the third set, Frankel was too tough 
for his Point Loma counterpart and 
came out on top 6-4 to win the 
match. 

The loss dropped the lritons' 
record to 9-8 on the year going into 
their match with Claremont 
College. A win in that match would 
give the Tri tons a chance to reach 
Nationals, while a loss would all 
but eliminate them from that 
opportunity. 

The match is at the UCSD 
North Courts at 2 p.m. on 
Saturday. Get out and root the 
Tritons on to victory. 

with the loss, while the 12th-
ranked Triton's improved to 13-12. 

ext up on the Triton polo 
team s agenda is the all-important 
Western Regional Qualification 
Tournament, which will be held in 
Los Angeles next weekend. A 
strong showing is vital to UCSD's 
postseason plans. as they look to 
qualify for the USA Collegiate 

ationals, which will be held May 
5-7 in Bloomington, Ind, UCSD 
has represented at this tourna-
ment every year except one since 
their inception and are hoping for 
another solid performance in 
nationals this year. 

Game three started omi-
nously as the Violets jumped 
out to an early 7-1 lead. UCSD 
was obviously envisioning what 
its celebration would be like 
while the Violets continued to 
dominate and got within five 
points of a game-three victory at 
10-5. 

That was when the Tritons 
awoke and reeled off 10 of the 
next 11 points to take the game 
15-11 and win the National 
Championship. 

Hite and Chen, the Tritons' 
workhorses all season long. 
were rewarded for their out-
standing effons by being named 
to the all-tournament team. 
Both recorded 15 kills in the 
championship match . Jordan 
Hove pitched in with 48 assists 
and five kills. 

For UCSD this was the end 
of a season that began with 
many questions. For seniors 
Earnest Yun and Raffi 

~itillian , it was a great way to 
end a very fruitful career at 
UCSD. 

Next season the only ques-
tion will be: With all but two 
players returning, can UCS D 
repeat?

Softball: 
Tritons take aU comers in 
Power Bar Classic 

Before every game, we talked 
about our goals. After the ' game, 
we evaluate: 

The Tritons did not need to 
worry as Harlan manned the 
mound. 

"Leea pitched the second 
game: Gerckens said , "She's our 
No. 1 pitcher. They didn't get 
hits i~ the second game." 

With Harlan tossing 
pitches, all UCSD 
needed was to get 
some offense going. 

"We did right from 
the beginning.· Gerckens 
said. "We were seeing the 
ball." . 

With the game scoreless in the 
second inning, the Tritons struck. 

UCSD's Natalie Andrade struck 
first with a single. A sacrifice 
moved her to second and Andrade . 
eventually went to third after 
Cynthia Sam reached base on an 
error. 

Samantha Hayes singled to 
drive in Andrade and Sam moved 
to second. Michelle Wilson 
loaded the bases with two outs 
after she singled, and teammate 
Erin Bridges drove in Sam with a 
sacrifice. 

. K~isti~a Anderson singled, 
bnngmg In Hayes, and the inning 
ended with UCSD up 3-0. 

The fifth inning saw the Tritons 
score again. 

Marcella Di Michieli singled, 
and Caroline Engler substituted as 
a pinch runner. Andrade reached 
base on an error, and Engler glided 
to second. Jeanine Cordero then 
singled to move the runners. That 
was followed by a sacrifice from 

Kim Vorsatz that drove in Engler 
and UCSD was up 4-0. 

That looked to be all that 
UCSD needed as Harlan con-
trolled Southwestern. 

Harlan gave up no runs and 
four hits and she struck out seven 
to take the 4-0 victory and earn 
MVP honors. 

The roa~ to the championship 
was not too difficult for UCSD. In 
their first game. the Tritons 
downed Claremon t College 3-1. 
Harlan picked up the win by 

striking out four batters and 
Hayes went 2-4 and scored a 

run . 
In UCSD's second 

game against La 
Verne. Harlan picked 
up her second win 4-

2 after striking out six 
batters. She also used 

her bat well, driving in 
three runs. 

The Tritons fell to Southwestern 
9-5, but that proved to be an anom-
aly. UCSD bounced back to win the 
championship. 

In earlier action on Friday 
morning. UCSD concluded a game 
against Claremont that it had start-
ed last month but was called due to 
darkness. 

The Thtons fell to Claremont in 
the makeup game 1-0 after an 
international tie-breaker, but it did 
not phase them as far as the tour-
nament was concerned. 

"I'm proud of them: Gerckens 
said. "That could have set the tone 
for the whole tournament. They 
could have taken that loss really 
hard. but they picked themselves 
up." 

This was the first time the 
Tritons have won the Power Bar 
Classic. 

Next up for UCSD is another 
home game. This time it squares 
off agaihst Biola University at 5 
p.m. in a double header.

Tennis Gets Back on Track with 
Victory Over Cal Poly Pomona 
After a shocking loss to Trinity College last weekend, the women's tennis 
. team made sure not to make it two losses in a row 
.y AllViND VA. AN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team improved its record to 15 
wins and 2 losses as it cruised to 
victory against Cal Poly Pomona 
on April 13 with an overall score 
of 9-0. 

The singles matches were 
dominated by UCSD; the closest 
match being senior Kelli Tsai's 7-
5, 6-1 victory over Pomona's 
Jadyn McGaugny. Kirsten Olsen 
and Rachel Gunther performed 
the equivalent of a shut-out by 
winning 6-0, 6-0 against Jenna 
Baker and Winter Melanson, 
respectively. 

The doubles matches show-
cased the depth of the UCSD 
team as it garnered a clean, 
three-set sweep. Whenever 
Pomona made a charge to curtail 
the gap, UCSD responded with 
brilliant shots at clutch 
moments. 

"Pomona is a Division II 
school that we will be playing 
next year in our conference: 
Head Coach Liz LaPlante said. 
"Their program has always been 
strong and competitive. We knew 
we had a chance when they lost 
to UC Davis earlier in the year 
and we beat Davis a couple of 
weeks ago." 

The team's next match is 
against Claremont College on 
April 22 in Claremont. 

"Claremont will be an impor-' 

tant match for us," LaPlante said. 
"They are Division III arid a team 
we might play in regionals. Their 
team has consistently posted good 
results, so it is crucial for us . to 
perform well against a team like 
Claremont." 

To recap the season, the 
women's tennis team caught fire 
early, winning 11 matches in a 
row to break in the new season. 

"Pomona is a Division II 
school that we will be 
playing next year in our 
conference. Their 
program has always 
been strong and 
competitive, 

-uz~. 
Women's Tennis Head Coach 

These victories in luded wins 
against Washington University 
from M~ssouri, Division I Iowa 
State and defel)ding Division III 
champion Amherst College. 

"If I needed to sum up a 
moment that turned it around for 
us, it ' was the match against 
Amherst Coillege.~ LaPlante said. 
"That match gave us an enormous 
amount of confidence in that we 
knew w'e could beat a top team in 
our Division. Also, the victory over 

Davis gave us a boost and 
momentum to follow in our win-
ning ways: 

Then came an aberration for 
the women's tcam: A loss against 
a tough Will iams College team 
from Massachusetts that is cur-
rently ranked No. 1 in their 
region. 

The team then went on to win 
three straight matches against 
University of San Francisco, UC 
Davis and Pomona-Pitzer College. 

Last Saturday, UCSD fell to 
Trinity College from Texas 3-6 at 
home. That loss was only the 
second loss in 16 matches for the 
women's team. With the victory 
against Cal Poly Pomona, the 15-
2 UCSD women's tennis team is 
primed to make a run for a top 
seed at regionals and an eventual 
national championship. 

"Our two losses against 
Williams and 'Trinity are losses 
that we could have turned in to 
wins: LaPlante said. "So overall. 
it cancels each other out: two big 
wins and two close losses. 

"We know we are a top four 
team in Division Il!, so it will be 
interesting to see how we do in 
regionals for the first time,N 
LaPlante added, "Since regionals 
take place at two sites, hopefully if 
we finish the season strong, we 
can host one site." 

Get out to the UCSD North 
Courts at 11 a.m. and root the 
Tritons on to victory over 
Claremont College.

Attendance Should 
Not be This Poor 

I haven't critiqued the general 
UCSD population in a long time, 
and I feel it is my duty as the sports 
editor to moan about the lack of 
interest in the sponing events on 
this campus. 

The point of my contention for 
this column is the attendance at 
the men's volleyball game last 
Tuesday. This was the final regular 
season game of the year for the 
volleyball team. UCSD was the 
top-ranked team in the nation 
heading into the match, and even 
more importantly, the match was 
against cross-town rival San Diego 
State. 

Despite all of these reasons to 
attend , only a meager 651 people 
showed up. Even more pathetic 
was the fact that this was, by far, 
the biggest crowd for a men's vol-
leyball game this season. 

I can usually make excuses for 
you guys, but this is something I 
JUSt don't understand . Most of 
you complain that we don't play 

~ood enough competition. Well, 
Judging by the volleyball atten-
dance this season, that isn't what 
is really holding you back. The 
men's volleyball team plays in the 
Mountain PaCific Sports Federa-
tion . This league contains all the 
top Division I volleyball teams in 
the country. This list includes 
juggernauts like UCLA, USC, 
Hawaii University, and Long 
Beach State. 

There is no higher-level com-
petition in the entire country. 

Many of you also complain that 
you can't take time out of your 
schedules to attend a sporting 
event on this campus. My only 
response to this is: bullshit! 

ThiS volleyball game hap-
pened on a Tuesday night in the 
middle of second week. There 
may be a few of you who had 
pressing academic endeavors to 
work toward on Tuesday night, 
but I doubt that the majority of 
you did. 

Moreover, there is no way that 
most of you could have had better 
social events to attend on Tuesday 
night. I have been at this school 
for three years; I know that there is 
nothing ever happening during 
week days and rarely anythi ng 
happening on the weekends, other 
than sporting events. 

I have come to the conclusion 
that the reason attendance at this 
institution stinks has nothing to 
do with competition or pressing 
school events. It has to do with 
apathy. You guys don't show up 
because it is just too much effon 
to leave your dorms or apartments 
to get out and suppon your fellow 
students. The only way I know 
how to end apathy is to get you 
guys out to these matches so you 
can realize how exciting they real-
lyare. 

So for those of you who don't 
go to sponi ng events normally, get 
out to one, just one, this week. J 
realize that midterms are fast 
approaching, but I don't think that 
any of you are so busy that you 
can't afford to spend a few hours 
supporting some of your fellow 
students. I promise you something 
strange will happen; you will have 
a good time. Maybe if enough of 
you take my advice, then we can 
start putting an end to this apathy 
that this campus suffers from.

Softball Finds Home Field 
to be Quite Adyantageous 
Tritons take a liking to familiar turf and go on 
to win the Power Bar Classic this weekend 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

After las! weekend the softball 
team will definitely attest to the 
saying that there is nothing like 
horne cooking. 

The UCSD softball team won 
the UC San Diego Power Bar 
Classic this past weekend at 
horne. 

l'he tournament took place 
Thursday and Friday and featured 
four schools: University of La 
Verne, Claremont College and 
two-year Southwestern College, 
in addition to UCSD. 

Leea Harlan had a fantastic 

tournament and was named the 
tournament's most. valuable play-
er after she won 3 games and 
tossed 17 strikeouts, allowing 
only 15 hits and 1 run in 18 
innings of. work. 

The championship game was 
against Southwestern College. 
This was not an easy task. The 
Tritons had already fallen to 
Southwestern earlier in the tour-
nament 9-5. 

"It goes back to making 
adjustments: Triton Head 
Coach Patti Gerckens said . 
"They had to stay up mentally.

Prospects 'did not look good for the 
UCSD men's volleyball team heading into 
this season. The team had lost three of its 
top players from the previous year, and a 
new coach, its third in three years, was tak-
ing the helm. These changes, combined 
with two straight years of missing the 
National Cllampionship Tournament, 
made this look like a rebuilding year for 
the Thitons. 

Looks can be very deceiving. 
This season saw the Tritons go unde-

feated in Division III play and earn their 
first Mountain Pacific Spons Federation 
win in two years. It also saw them return to 
the National Championship Tournament, 
a tournament that they won this weekend 
with two three-game wins in Hoboken , 

.j. 
In their semi-final match up on Friday 

night, the Thirons dismantled an under-
manned Stevens Tech team 15-6,15-7,15-
6. The Tritons were led on offense by Ben 
Vernon who recorded 12 kills and also tal-
lied one service acc. Zack Hite also helped 
the Thiton cause with 11 kills and two ser-
vice aces. Donald Chen, the Tritons' go-to 
player, was used sparin,$ly against Stevens 
Tech because his skills were not needed to 
ensure the victory. 

In the finals, the Tritons faced off 
against the New York University Violets. 
This opponent was no stranger to the 
Tritons, as Head Coach Ron Larsen had 
expected to play the Violets in the final 
match. His team had defeated them in a 
hard-fought four-game match earlier this 
season. Almost everything went the 
Thitons' way as UCSD won the National 
Championship with a 15-4, 15-12, 15-11 
victory. 

In the first game, the Tritons had no 
troubles at all. Larsen had spoken of the 
importance of getting off to a fast stan 
against NYU earlier in the week, and his 
team was obviously listening. The game 
was never close, and UCS D rolled to a 15-
4 victory. 

The second game looked to be going 
much the same way as the Violets had no

The Triton women's water polo 

roller coaster ride continued this 
past weekend at the Canyonview 
Pool. A heanbreaking Fridayafter-
noon loss to the San Diego State 
Aztecs gave way to a convincing 
victory over Loyola Maramount 
University on Saturday. 

According to many of the polo 
spectators, the intensity shown in 
the pool on Friday afternoon in 
the Aztec-Triton match up was 
above and beyond anything dis-
played by either squad all season 
long. 'The Thitons, hot off their 

Western Water Polo Association 
Tournament victory, had the 
momentum. 

On this day, however, the 
Aztecs prevailed, nipping UCSD 
by -a 4-2 final score. This defen-
sive battle, which saw a mere 
three combined goals scored in 
each half, carne down to whichev-
er team blinked first. 

UCSD could not contain the 
first quaner antics of San Diego 
State's Megan Dunbar who had a 
game-leading two goals in the 
period. The Thiton squad had 
ample opponunities to take the
