Prop 0 orators 
debate issue 

BY RANDY HILL 
About the only point that proponents and 

opponents of San Diego's Proposition 0 
agref!d on in yesterday's Revelle Plaza was 
the text of the local rent control measure. 

Tom Co den, a repre entative from San 
Diegians for Affordable Hou ing, and Richard 
Riel from San Diegan Against Rent Control, 
argued over the effectivene s of the measure, 
the co t of its implementation, the type of 
bureaucratic admini tration that would be 
required for the measure, and whether or not 
the mea ure would help to rectify the 
hortage of apartment in the San Diego area. 
The two spoke at a rally pon ored by the 

UCSD chapter of the California Public 
Interest Research Group, which wa trying to 
attract tudents to register to vote on the la t 
eligible day. 

As Nancy Laga, CalPIRG Representative 
explained, the measure i especially 
important to students since, in just the past 
year, the San Diego Planning Commission 
voted to convert 750 apartment units in the 
La Jolla Village Square ' area to 
condominiums, in direct violation of the 
University housing plan for the area.

Proposition 0 is a measure that would set 
rents back to a base date of August 3, 1977, to 
be readjusted to 1980 level based upon 
inflation by a local Fair Rent Board. Eight 
such Boards, followin~ the same boundaries 
as City Council Distncts, would be formed. 
Each Board would be comprised of two 
elected renters , two 'elected apartment

Reagan support on campus is nonexistent 
Youth director of campaign \ says acceptance is better at SDS U and USD 

BY DEAN HAAS 
Despite a recent San Diego 

County poll showing Ronald 
Reagan leading John 
Anderson and President 
Carter with 45 percent of the 
vote, Youth Director of the 
San Diego Reagan for 
President campaign admits 
that support for Reagan at 
UCSD is virtually "non· 
exi tent." 

Don Blackwell, 24·year old 
director of Reagan's youth 
campaign in San Diego, says 
"UCSD is an Anderson 
campus ... there's nothing we 
can do about it." 

Blackwell has been on 
campus three times this year 
and has been unable to drum 
up any movement for the 

republican candidate. But 
support at other San Diego 
college is strong, Blackwell 
says. 

"Overall, I've had fantastic 
response on the ,campu, 
ses ... far better than I 
expected ." 

Blackwell cites San Diego 
State University and ' 
University of San Diego as 
having the strongest Reagan 
youth organizations, Over 75 
students are involved in the 
campaign at SDSU, manning 
tables and distributing 
information about Reagan 
and other local Republican 
candidates. 

Yet 22 percent of San Diego 
voters and a larger 
percentage of student voters

with six to nine foot breakers at every fifteen

pre idential choice, the poll 
revealed . 

"Forty percent of the 
college studenls are· still 
undecided," Blackwell say, 
attributing this large 
percentage to student apathy 
towards the three candi-
dates. 

"We (the Reagan cam· 
paign) keep in mind that 
college student don 't vote," 
Blackwell says. The great 
majority of Reagan ' , support 
comes from "the taxpayer ," 
who will carry the former 
governor to victory, 
Blackwell believes. 

Anderson who collected 20 
percent of the San Diego vote 
as per the poll, will suffer 

most from student apathy, 
ay Blackwell. "The only 

support Anderson has i

FUNT, MICHIGAN -For 
visitors to Buick's Final 
Assembly Line, the end of a 
two mile-long complex which 
forms North America's 
largest single industrial 
plant, the company provides 
a booklet of written profiles 
on some of the workers. 
Among them is Carl 
Routhier, who is pictured ' 
happily adjusting something 
on an engine with his right 
hand. As he nears ret i remen t, 
Routhier says, "My family 
lives in the Flint area, and I 
wouldn't move away ... I will 
miss the large ~rt Buick has 
played in my hfe." 

The booklet goes on to say, 
"Carl will be hard to replace. 
He has never had an 
unexcused absence, but he 
was one minute late in 1955 
when he ran out of gas and 
had to walk three miles to 
work." 

Workers like Carl Routhier 
may be even harder to replace 
than the General Motors 
management realizes, given 
the .. feelings of a new 
generation of working class 
youths. 

"I've been making a lot of 
money," admits Leonard 
White, 24, a machinist at 
Flint's Chevrolet Truck 
Plant. '" bou~ht a house and 
a pickup. (It's Japanese· 
made," he laughs.) 

"But something. just ain't 
right, you know? It's like I go 
home every night and say, 
'Man, is this it? Is this all 
there's going to be?'" 

Even if the precipitous 
deCline of the US auto 
industry can be reversed -
which appears highly 
unlikely - renewed job 
security will not close this 
sharp gap between how 
young auto workers now 
view their lives and how their 
parents once did. 

The new generation has 
built a culture of its own 
around the experience of the

factory, but will have nothing 
to do with loyalty for the 
company or 9,uiet acceptance 
of a tedIOUS hfe. 

Daryl Lane is a thin, dark-
haired man of 25 who smokes 
nervously and talks a little 
distractedly. For four years 
he worked in the foundry of 
the giant Buick complex. He 
finally quit because he had 
trouble breathing and was 
tired of scrubbing with a wire 
brush every day to get the 
dirt and steel fi lings out ofthe 
pores of his skin.

because II, 1111.

WtlS tired of sct14~. 
willt Q wire 
every day to get 
steel filings out of

Having left his wife and 
son long ago, Lane now lives 
alone in an apartment which 
is barely furnished, except 
for two thousand doJlars' 
worth of stereo equipment 
and some crates filled with 
record albums by New Wave 
rock groups like Police, the 
Clash, the Cars, and the B-
52s. "Music is my food," Lane 
says. "Whenever I get any 
money, I go out and buy some 
music instead of groceries." 

Although Lane may be an 
extreme example of worker 
alienation, he nonetheless 
shares with Leonard White 
and other young people a deep 
disaffection which extends 
well beyond the threat of 
layoffs and touches every 
part of their lives. 

Deborah Young, 25, is the 
daughter of a man who came 
to Flint from Alabama to 
work in the shop. "I went t4> 
work in the shop when I was 
19, just out of hi_gh school," 
she explains. "When they 
§ave me the job, they said, 
This is the biggest favor

You t re goin~ to work here 30 
years, right. ' I was making a 
lot of money, but I was 
spending it all at the same 
time: clothes, an apartment, 
a car. I used to cry every day 
before I had to go to work." 

"A lot of people - men as 
well as women - cry when 
they start out, but later they 
get u ed to it," according to 
Anna Bentson, 30. "It's like a 
wound which becomes 
callou ed over." 

Like Daryl Lane, thes 
young people find consolation 

... '., •• •. 'if.' .... 

- and release - in music. It 
is a peculiar form of music, 
suggestive of the grinding, 
screeching sounds of the 
factory , and performed in 
cavernous local bars. In a 
way. this music makes sense 
out of an otherwise hostile 
environment by reworking 
the material of that 
environment into a special 
art form which "belongs" to 
these young workers. 

The scene at one such bar, 
the Embers Lounge, actually 
bears a certain resemblance 
to the scene at the Buick 
Assembly. Here the Nick 
Garvey Band, a New Wave 
group with ties to Motor City 
rock of the Sixties, launches a 
version of "C.C. Rider," 
originally recorded by a 
group called "Mitch Rxder 
and the Detroit Wheels. ' As 
the lead singer screams over 
a thundering bass and an 
insistent rhythm guitar , 
flashing red lights move 
across the dance floor like 
traffic at a heavy intersec· 
tion: Dancers abandon 
themselves to frantic 
gestures, rivalled only by 
those made by teams at Buick 
who have to install bumpers 
on moving cars. 

The conversation at one of 
the tables revolves around 
the subject of bad marriages. 
A woman has been cheating 
on her husband, whom she 
considers stupid and boring. 
She tells her friends that her 
husband 's form of protest 
has been to scream at her and 
wreck the household 
furniture. The talk turns to 
the past, of aborted attempts 
to start life anew in exotic 
places like Florida and 
California, where the men 
worked construction and the 
women worked as waitress· 
es. They all eventually 
returned to Flint. 

There is talk of getting laid 
off, of getting evicted , of 
having to move from an 
apartment complex to a 
trailer park, of having pickup 
trucks and snowmobiles 
repossessed by the bank .. 
There is little talk of the 
future. No one seems to know 
anything about the future, or 
even to cale that much.

stat ion which played the 
song was overwhelmed by 
requests for it, and 
announced plans to get 
copies "to everyone in this 
city." 

"I'm a Flintoid" 
demonstrates one way in 
which rock music - Punk , 
New Wave, or just old·time 
rock 'n roll - attempts to 
come to terms with the 
day·to-day reality of an 
industrial environment. 
Even the names of many 
groups reflect a desire to 
speak for the inhabitants 
of an over-technologized 

c~l.ture. Young people in

this "hard drivin'" genre

"Motor City Breakdown 
looks at the confusion of 
Detroit 's Woodw ard 
Avenue through the 
steamed-up windows of a 
car's back seat. 

Peter Wolf, a member of 
J. Geils, tried to explain in 
a Det roi t Free Press 
interview why his band 
has such an enormous 
following in that part of 
the country: "You see, 
when you 're a kid in a 
factory town, you got only 
two choices: staying and 
enduring the factory life, 
or getting out. But either 
way you gotta be tough. 
There's got to be a relea e 
for the frustrations, and 
Detroit kids express that 
release through rock 'n' 
roll." 

Aside from si mply 
relieving tension, these 
bands may be helping to 
make life bearable by 
reorganizing the sounds of 
city and factory in musical 
form: a phenom enon 
anthropologists would call 
music's "validation" of 
life. This connection can 
be understood by listening 
to the sounds of the factory 
as a musician might.

NEWS BRIEFS 

Iraqi forces capture 
port city in Iran 

BAGHDAD, Iraq -Iraqi 
warplanes bombed Tehran 
yesterday and the Iranian 
radio said the raid killed 
three people and wounded 65. 
A Briti s h correspondent

news conference in Ahwaz, a 
third city under attack by 
Iraqis, that Iraq had thrown 
10 divisions, with a total of 
100.000 men, into its invasion 
of Iran. 

The Iranian news agency 

Pars quoted him as saymg 
two divisions were destroyed 
in "the last two days of 
fighting" in the Ahwaz area.

SAN FRANCISCO - A

urged California's Supreme

pot initiative placed on the 
November ballot. 

Few students showed interest in the Proposition 0 rally sponsored by Calpirg

Chancellor's associates 
honor three professors 

Spiro, Solis and Metzger gain $1000 
Three UCSD faculty 

members have been honored 
for excellence in teaching, 
community interaction and 
research by the UCSD 
Chancellor's Associates. 

They are: Dr. Melford E. 
of anthro-

Thomas A. Metzter 
pology, wno was given the 
award for excellence in 
teaching; Faustina Solis, 
associate professor of 
community medicine, who 
was given the award for 
excellence in community 
service, and Dr. Thomas A. 
~etzger,professorofhistory , 
who was given t he awards for 
excellence in research. 

The awards, which include 
a grant of $1.000 each. were 
established by the Chancel· 
lor's Associates during the 
1974·75 acadefttit rear as a 
means of bringtng attention 
to the high quality of the 
research, teachillB and public 
service taking place on the 
campus. 

The winners were selected 
by a six·member committee 
under the chairmanship of 

Armon Kamesar, a San Diego 
business executive and a 
member of the Chancellor's 
Associates. The awards were 
presented at the fall meeting 
of the. Associates held 
recently at University House. 

Spiro, who joined the 
UCSD faculty in 1968, is the 
founder of the Department of 
Anthropology on the campus 
and served as its first 
chairman from 1968 to 1971. 
He has conducted anthro· 
pological field work in 
Thailand , Burma, Israel and 
MiHonesia and with the 

Faustina Solis 

Ojibwa Indians in Wisconsin. 
His Excellence in Teaching 
award stated "Though his 
courses are rigorous, hard 
and heavy in the work and 
intellectual response 
expected, they are invariably 
praised by his students." 

Solis joined the Depart· 
ment of Community Medi· 
cine faculty at the UCSD 
School of Medicine in 1971 
after service with the State 

Department of Public Health 
as Director of the Farm 
Workers Health Service. She 
received the award in 
Community Service "in 
recognition of sustained and 
outstanding contributions to 
the commun ' over the past 

Melford E. Spiro 

nine years ... . playing a key 
role in the establishment of 
rural and migrant health 
centers throughout Calif· 
ornia. Her election as the first 
non physician president of 
the California Association for 
Maternal and Child Health is 
a reflection of the high 
esteem in which she is held." 

Metzger joined the UCSD 
Department of History in 
1970 after serving for a year 
as a lecturer in Chinese 
studies at the Hebrew 
University in lersalem. 
According to the awards 
committee, "His scholarly 
research and publications 
have had a major impact on 
Chinese studies both here 
and abroad . 

Hospital gives pregnancy info 
BY BLAK.E4SHAW 

Volunteers are needed to 
staff the only information 
center in the US dealing with 
the effects of exposure to 
external agents such as 
drugs, cigarettes, medica· 
tions, x·rays, alcohol, and 
pesticides, on the unborn 
child. The Teratogen 
Registry is a research and 
phone information service 
operated at the UCSD 
Medical Center at University 
Hospital. It responds to calls 
mostly from pregnant 
women and physicians who 
need to know the possible 
harmful effects of external 
agents, known as "terato-
gens," to the unborn child . 
The Registry, in operation 
since February 1979, is 
expanding from a county· 
wide to a state-wide service 
and thirty new volunteers 
are needed to help answer the 
phones. 

In late November, the 
service will be publicized 
throughout the state, and a 
toll·free (BOO) number will be 
initiated. During the past few 
weeks local publiCIty has 
greatly increased the number 
of calls the Registry receives. 
They now receive about 20 
calls per day. When the 
serv ice is publicized state· 
wide, usage should again 
jump dramatically. 

Coordinating the Registry 
is Christine Kelley. Since 
many of caller are in a state 

of severe anxiety and the 
situations are sensitive and 
highly confidential, Kelley 
says a special type of 
volunteer who has taken . 
intensive training is needed. 

"The woman who's been in 
the position of calling the 
Registry herself would make 
an ideal volunteer. Some past 
experience in the health field 
or sciences would be useful, 
but first and foremost this 

work requires a sympathetic 
ear and someone who can 
listen or learn to listen. The 
ability to establish a quick 
rapport with the caller is 
absolutely vital," she says. 

The Registry is looking for 
volunteers from all racial and 
cultural backgrounds. who 
can rommit at least four 
months of performing 
preliminary counseling and

Circle K club allows 
students to help society 

BY CARMELITA ROSAL 
UCSD students with a 

desire to do humanitarian 
service have an on·campus 
outlet for their energies: the 
Circle K Club. The club falls 
'unlter the organizational 
umbrella of Kiwanis 
International and has 
chapters on high school and 
college campuses throughout 
the country. Kiwanis is the 
largest college·service 
organization of its type in 
the United States and the 
UCSD chapter has been on 
campus since ]968 but was 
only officially chartered in 
1979. 

Although the club publi· 
cizes its purpose and 
activities, the lack of student 
response prevents the 
organization from function · 
ing as actively as it would 

like, according to Gary 
~cCowan, governor of the 
California district. With only 
12 members, the UCSD 
chapter is too small to 
sustain the type and scale of 
community service involve· 
ment often performed by 
other chapters. 

But that does not prevent 
the 12 mem bers of the Circle 
K chapter here from 
pursuing the organization's 
stated goals of "rendering 
unselfish service to society in 
an effort to all ('vi ate some of 
(its) ills." 

"Last year, 35 Circle K 
Club participants from 
Arizona and California were 
able to raise $5,000 for 
multiple c1erosis victims." 
says McCowan.

are forms of expression 
which give their drivers a 
feeling, however illusory, of 
personal control over the 
mechanized structures 
which dominate their 
environment. 

Not all frustrations can be 
resolved on the dance floor or 
behind the wheel of a 
powerful. customized auto, 
however. Sometimes they 
reach th(: factory itself, 
where the differences 
between Flint's working 
class generations are most 
telling. 

The noise and tedium 
affect both young and old 
workers. But unlike their 
parents, most of Flint 's new 
generat ion of auto workers 
have grown up believing that 
this is not an acceptable 
career - that they have been 
left behind by their college· 
educated , white·collar peers 
and an increasingly de· 
industrialized economy. And 
also unlike their parents, 
they seldom identify with the 
aim of their employer. 

Anna Hentson used to 
work in the Chevrolet 
Manufacturinlf Plant , known 
as "the Hole, to its young 
employees. "I had never been 
that dirty in my life," she 
remarks. I came home 
looking like a coal miner 
every day.

basic campaign materials. 
"I've had to cut my days on 
the campuses down from five 
to three a week," Blackwell 
says. 

Blackwell attributes the 
lack of funds to the fact that 
Reagan forces are "very 
confident they have Cali-
fornia." 

Since California is seen as 
a "Reagan state," money is 
being directed from the 
national campaign organiza-

tion in Virginia to where 
Reagan face the toughest 
opposition, Blackwell 
explains. 

Blackwell describes 
studen.ts approaching him 
regardmg Governor Reagan 
as "pretty mellow." The 
questIons most asked deal 
with Reagan's mystique of 
being a "dangerous man with 
his finger on the button." 
The campaign has trained it 
volunteers to answer these 
~ueries by saying that 
• Governor Reagan has a 
wife, a family, and grand-
children. He is human just 
like everybody else."
